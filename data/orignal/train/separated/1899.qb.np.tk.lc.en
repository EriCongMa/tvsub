superman here broke protocol and ran into the crash
to shield a kid from the blast .
ethan .
dad .
stay with mom , all right ?
where is my mom ?
who are you ?
it &apos;s me , mom . ethan .
no , it &apos;s not . who is he ?
no , i &apos;m not going anywhere !
how about we set you up in a room
and you can stay with him there ?
brooks , why don &apos;t you step up ? switch with ross .
god , you have fast hands , brooks .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
just so we &apos;re clear , i &apos;m not going down without a fight .
i want you to map me .
i want to know if i &apos;m gonna get alzheimer &apos;s .
patients say it all the time ...
&quot; tell me straight up .
i just want to know what &apos;s going on . &quot;
okay , so i &apos;ve got the results
of your genome sequencing here .
now we weren &apos;t able to get a clear read off zola &apos;s sample .
sometimes we just have to run it again .
but yours came out .
and ?
&quot; tell me . i can handle it . &quot;
and , oh , uh , first off ,
i just need to ask you a few questions .
we have a couple of different kinds of ,
um , information here , so--
i have the gene . just say it .
look , this test gives us tons of information .
some of it &apos;s clear . and some of it isn &apos;t .
so , you know , we don &apos;t want to jump to anything
without careful consideration of--
yeah , i &apos;ve carefully considered .
do i have the alzheimer &apos;s gene ?
you gonna let me get through this questionnaire ?
bailey , you &apos;re my mentor
and my friend , and i respect your work ,
but i &apos;m telling you , if you don &apos;t answer my question ,
i will punch you in the face .
we don &apos;t dodge your questions &apos; cause we &apos;re mean .
okay , you have ...
tested positive for more than one
of the genetic markers for alzheimer &apos;s .
we do it because when you say you want the truth ...
you have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
shepherd says his wife &apos;s still unconscious , too .
oh , what did you do with her kid ?
oh , he ... he was in peds overnight ,
just so social services didn &apos;t haul him off .
his grandmother comes today .
you know what ? i thought i was gonna see you last night .
oh , i got caught up with a patient .
ah , that &apos;s too bad .
i put on that t @-@ shirt
you said i &apos;m not allowed to wear when we &apos;re arguing
&apos;cause it makes you forget what your point was .
i can &apos;t believe i missed it .
i can throw it on again tonight .
i mean , why is he still out ?
you said that he would wake up
when you reversed his hypothermia .
yeah , i said he might .
or he might eight hours later or eight days later .
if it &apos;s any more than that , we have a problem ,
but not until then .
you talk to russell about it ?
he knows about the eight days thing .
maybe you should just check in with him .
you said yourself that he &apos;s not
supervising you that much lately .
there &apos;s no news .
if i go to him with this information ,
he &apos;ll think i &apos;ve lost my mind .
well , then he can come talk to me .
your hair looks really nice today .
my hair looks nice every day .
i &apos;m on bailey &apos;s--
no .
last time i was with her ,
i ordered the wrong test , twice .
if she has a 3 @-@ strike policy , i &apos;m out .
i &apos;m on jackson &apos;s service today .
so even if i cared , i wouldn &apos;t trade .
what is this ?
i don &apos;t know what that is .
it is a crumb ,
and it was stuck to my laptop
after you used it to update my notes
right next to a splotch of ...
what could either be pizza sauce or blood .
i think it &apos;s pizza .
i was hoping it was blood , and you were dying
and not just getting pizza all over my computer .
i &apos;m so sorry . i was doing my notes late ,
and i hadn &apos;t eaten--
i &apos;ll go clean it off .
these interns are sloppy .
you people are training sloppy interns .
and i trained you ,
which means you &apos;re bringing shame to the whole family .
i just got here .
swag bags for the syrians .
some , um , sweatshirts and baseball caps , post @-@ its .
ooh , really cool penlights .
ooh , those are nice .
you &apos;re sending post @-@ its to syria ?
yeah , i &apos;m working with doctors aid international .
we &apos;ve flown in two syrian doctors .
they &apos;re general practitioners , but now with the war ,
they &apos;ve been recruited to staff the field hospitals .
they &apos;re getting advanced trauma training
with seattle pres , and they &apos;re here
for a crash course in basic surgical skills .
they need to learn what they can do quick and dirty .
they rope you in ?
which must mean that ...
yeah . yeah , they &apos;re losing a lot of kids .
godspeed .
all right , let &apos;s get this stuff
with the boxes of supplies we &apos;re sending back with them .
ah , so bailey got her genome thing funded .
you got this thing funded .
i need to get my cartilage project bankrolled
while we still got bank .
dr. hunt ?
dr. avery &apos;s recommendation on your burn patient .
um , have you rounded on matthew taylor yet ?
he was one of avery &apos;s patients yesterday .
he was here overnight for observation .
they were worried about a concussion .
he &apos;ll probably leave this afternoon .
i think his mom &apos;s coming to get him .
tell avery that is fine .
ready ?
yeah .
um , wait .
his--his mom is coming to pick him up ?
what , can he walk ?
you &apos;ll have to ask dr. avery .
joyce basche .
you and i put in a dialysis graft two weeks ago .
she &apos;s had fevers to 102 and the site is red and tender .
it looks infected .
maybe you dropped a pizza crust on her wound .
i told him it &apos;s normal , right ?
it &apos;s red and swollen .
she said come in if it was swollen or red .
he loves doctors , you in particular .
you do like spending time with me .
get her healthy , we &apos;ll have you over for dinner .
okay , well , he &apos;s right .
so give her a gram of cefazolin .
it &apos;s probably a post @-@ operative infection .
dr. murphy is gonna run some labs
and get an ultrasound .
we &apos;ll figure out what &apos;s going on .
okay .
you tested positive for the risk factor genes .
it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re gonna get it .
i know what it means .
it &apos;s entirely possible it means nothing at all .
we need an updated will .
i want you to call the lawyer .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . slow down .
even if you get the disease , it &apos;s decades away .
it might not be .
we have a child
and we &apos;re having another child .
look , right now , it says that lexi is zola &apos;s legal guardian
if anything happens to us .
that &apos;s not going to work .
no , but--
derek , we were in a plane crash .
we don &apos;t need alzheimer &apos;s--
potential alzheimer &apos;s .
we need an updated will .
okay . you &apos;re right . i will contact the guy .
okay .
&quot; she &apos;s killing me &quot;
okay , we &apos;re gonna try as closely as we can
to replicate your circumstances in the field hospital .
the most important skills you need in a wartime situation
is controlling bleeding .
normally we &apos;d use lasers and argon beam coagulators ,
but as you can see , for now ,
we &apos;re only using
the contents of this tray .
is something wrong ?
uh , we , um , before had all of these things ,
but recently the supply trucks cannot reach us ,
and the electricity is unreliable ,
so many of our instruments , we--we cannot use .
so if you want to , um , replicate our circumstances ,
we may need to adjust this slightly .
please . we &apos;re here to make this work for you .
thank you . um ...
this is more right .
also ...
now we go .
dr. shepherd , hey .
i wanted to follow up on the patients we saw yesterday ,
&apos;cause i care .
ross , you should be learning something else
from someone else .
oh , i am . i &apos;m covering the pit ,
which i can do and manage your post @-@ ops .
also , i brought you a latte .
it &apos;s not your job to bring my coffee .
sorry . i &apos;m here . i had to get a piece of gum .
i had epically bad breath .
i didn &apos;t want it to bowl you over in the o.r. , but ...
i &apos;m all set . see ?
i didn &apos;t need to see it .
okay . well , i &apos;m going to check your post @-@ ops .
anything you &apos;d like me to look for ?
ross already did it .
spectacular .
anything we should know ?
yeah , rachel dawson &apos;s awake .
tell hunt she &apos;s up .
we &apos;re gonna send you back with a bunch of equipment ,
uh , but if supplies aren &apos;t reaching you
and there &apos;s no electricity ,
then we &apos;re gonna have to figure out another way .
yeah , so , um , take a look around
and see what items you do have left in the field hospital ,
and , uh , put it in the box .
dr. hunt . can i borrow you ?
i don &apos;t think i should go in there .
she &apos;s okay now , ethan .
she was really mad when she saw me before .
she wasn &apos;t mad at you . she was confused .
there &apos;s something in her head that they needed to fix ,
and they &apos;ve done that .
she &apos;s back to her old self again .
you sure ?
i don &apos;t know 100 % , ethan , but ...
i think we should try , okay ?
all right .
ethan ?
you &apos;re okay ?
come here .
oh .
oh , god .
i love you so much .
did you get hurt ?
no ?
you look really good .
my car crash mom woke up .
and the lawyer sent over an e @-@ mail
with the forms .
we need two names-- a guardian and a backup .
before it was lexie , cristina , and owen .
so cristina and then which one of your sisters
do you want as a backup ?
cristina doesn &apos;t want children .
this isn &apos;t children . it &apos;s zola and fetus .
stop calling the baby fetus .
well , she will love him whatever his name is .
all right , talk to her and see what she says .
i know what she &apos;ll say .
and i &apos;ll be wrong , and that &apos;ll be good for everybody .
my talk was a viral sensation .
cartilage is trending ...
because of me .
i couldn &apos;t be happier .
a cartilage regeneration lab
would be a huge boon for the hospital .
i am not an a.t.m.
i have one vote just like you do
and arizona does .
oh , no . arizona has to vote for me &apos; cause she &apos;s my wife .
and your vote is like a vote and a half .
uh @-@ huh . i &apos;ll vote for myself .
now that is a solid voting block .
you put a lot of thought into this , huh ?
is this how it works ?
you all whisper to each other in your board meetings
about your pet projects ,
and that &apos;s where all the money goes ?
that &apos;s exactly how it works .
that is not how it works .
everybody &apos;s supposed to submit their proposals in writing .
you can &apos;t have people bugging board members
while they &apos;re trying to work .
uh ... you &apos;re sitting in a chair .
i need money for my orphan thing . i want to take it global .
you see what you &apos;ve done ?
who canceled my valve replacement ?
hunt canceled half of everybody &apos;s day .
thank you for coming , everyone .
sorry we had to rearrange your schedule ,
but this is important .
we &apos;ve got two syrian doctors here .
they used to be gps . ,
but now they &apos;re operating in a field hospital
in a war zone .
we were planning on teaching them surgical procedures
they could do with limited resources ,
but it turns out they have way less to work with
than we anticipated .
just give &apos; em more stuff .
when it runs out in two weeks ,
they &apos;ll be right back where they started .
he wants to help them function with what they know they have .
which is this .
so ... we need to
be able to do the procedures on this list
using only what is in this box .
are you kidding me ? there &apos;s no way .
there has to be . we gotta figure it out .
joyce basche &apos;s labs . she &apos;s in ultrasound now .
mm . her white count &apos;s pretty high .
and her electrolytes are off .
um , i think we err on the side of caution
and admit her .
and , uh , this is kind of weird .
um , we have another post @-@ op complication
on the same day as mrs. basche .
and , uh , i scrubbed in on both of them with you .
and you managed their post @-@ op care ?
okay , you better go through
all your notes on both these charts
and figure out what the hell went wrong .
edwards , you &apos;re with me today .
i &apos;m with dr. avery today .
ditch him . murphy &apos;s having a time @-@ out .
what did you do ?
so the second post @-@ op infection was your patient , too ?
kathy dong .
does she need surgery ?
probably .
and bailey got medusa to scrub in with her this afternoon
on the first lady that came in with an infection .
they &apos;ve gotta take out her shunt .
it &apos;s got this huge abscess under it .
it &apos;s a mess .
they &apos;re gonna kill me .
what did you do ?
did you forget the pre @-@ op antibiotics or scrub too fast ?
i was sick . i had the flu or something .
and you came in ?
of course i did .
we all work when were sick , all the time .
patients have post @-@ op infections
all the time , right ?
okay , so they can debride the wounds
with a basic instrument set ,
but now they &apos;re faced with a huge risk of infection .
well , i guess wound vacs are out of the question then .
simple wet @-@ to @-@ dry dressings might work ?
mm . no .
they &apos;d have to change those out three times a day .
they would use their entire gauze supply with one patient .
sugar .
excuse me ?
it &apos;s not in the box , but they may have it around .
it &apos;s an osmotic dressing
that allows you to avoid multiple dressing changes .
okay . well , somebody go find out if they still have sugar .
okay .
anything ?
you &apos;ve barely made a dent .
it &apos;s gonna take forever .
oh ! well , you try using this hand drill ,
mr. backseat driver .
let me try .
if they had an infrascanner , it would be a lot easier .
well , they don &apos;t . i think whoever it is ,
you just killed him .
you know , start with a fresh one .
oh , does anybody have any betadine ?
i just have bleach .
yeah , that &apos;ll work .
sure .
all right .
so anybody ready to start teaching ?
uh , me . i can do fracture repairs .
yeah , you can put me down .
i got a blade i can use for skin grafting .
great . get to the lab . uh , shepherd ,
how long till rachel dawson &apos;s out of the i.c.u. ?
oh , check with ross .
he &apos;s tracking her through post @-@ op .
wait . i thought brooks was on your service today .
ross gets connected to the patients .
he likes to follow through .
owen , peds just called .
ethan dawson &apos;s grandmother got stuck back east .
her flight got canceled ,
and she &apos;s not gonna make it here until tomorrow .
so i think you should call social services
and see if they can take him for the night .
but this is pretty standard , right ?
this must happen all the time .
it &apos;s an unusually aggressive infection ,
but we &apos;re gonna take care of it .
ah , she said it was nothing , and i knew it .
steven-- no .
i waited a whole day .
i am going to take care of her , you hear me ?
and now even if you don &apos;t have an electric dermatome ,
you can still do skin grafts using blades .
but you want to be very careful
about how much pressure you apply .
you don &apos;t want to cut too deep .
mm . is that okay ?
that &apos;s good . but no deeper .
yeah , that &apos;s better .
okay , so you want to place the screws
medial to the tibial crest
so you don &apos;t interfere with intravascular bundle .
medial to the tibial crest .
mm @-@ hmm . now advance the screw by hand . yeah .
until it &apos;s anchored in the far cortex .
don &apos;t be afraid to push too hard .
ah , sorry . i &apos;m--i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m trying to figure out
how to hold down the patient to keep him still
while i do this .
oh , the patient &apos;s sedated .
not when you don &apos;t have anesthesia .
o @-@ okay .
let &apos;s go at this another way .
i am so sorry i wasn &apos;t here earlier .
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;ve got these two syrian doctors here
and we &apos;re trying to get all the surgeons
to figure out how to do these procedures
with , like , a piece of gum and a matchstick ,
and this was our first pee break .
and meanwhile , you &apos;re sitting here .
and you can &apos;t even walk ?
i thought it was just a small laceration .
it is . i &apos;m fine .
but is it infected ? because you should be able to walk .
april . april .
i don &apos;t know why you can &apos;t walk .
april , i can walk . i &apos;m ...
you can ?
w--they said that you-- you couldn &apos;t leave
till your mom came to pick you up .
oh . uh ... i , um ...
my mom &apos;s not coming here
because i can &apos;t get myself home .
she &apos;s coming here because
i wanted her to meet you .
i had a low @-@ grade fever .
i felt bad the night before ,
but when i woke up , i figured i could muscle through it .
so i came in .
i felt okay for most of the day ,
so i figured it wasn &apos;t--
of course i &apos;ll take zola and fetus .
that &apos;s what i told derek .
you &apos;re not shipping them off to ohio
or wherever his stupid sisters are from .
i knew you would say that .
i will oversee the most competent herd
of child care professionals ever .
i &apos;ll get only german nannies .
they &apos;re super organized .
i &apos;m not sure a herd of german nannies
is what i had in mind .
wait . you don &apos;t want me to be a stay @-@ at @-@ home mom ?
no .
yeah , &apos; cause you &apos;re not .
right , but zola is at the day care here
when we pick her up .
yeah , and you do 30 % less surgeries than i do
&apos;cause you &apos;re not putting in the hours anymore .
you don &apos;t want to do this .
hey , i love zola .
i know you do .
but you don &apos;t want to be her mom .
no .
you really hate those sisters ?
kind of .
not all of them .
kathleen seems like a good mom .
i mean , i don &apos;t want to hang out with her all the time ,
but her kids seem sane .
yeah , well , that &apos;s not nothing .
okay , how about this ?
you write in the will
that i get your children three weeks every year .
we &apos;ll travel .
i &apos;ll take them to get their first tattoo--
someplace clean .
and i &apos;ll teach &apos; em how to put a condom
on a--on a cucumber .
okay .
i will be the coolest aunt in the world .
i just can &apos;t be a mom .
they deserve a mom .
they already have a mom .
i know .
you &apos;re not dying right now . you know that , right ?
dr. webber . i paged you .
can you check out bed three ?
patient is seth lepik .
erythema and swelling along a surgical site .
febrile . looks pretty sick .
probably needs to be admitted .
sorry .
i &apos;ll be right back .
dr. shepherd just ordered an m.r.i.
on one of his patients .
i thought you were covering the pit .
oh , i am .
my generation &apos;s all about multitasking , sir .
mr. lepik , i &apos;m dr. webber .
i understand that you &apos;re not feeling well .
yeah , um ...
i &apos;ve been dizzy for a couple of days ,
and they said to come back in if i didn &apos;t feel good .
they who ?
you guys .
i had surgery here a couple of weeks ago .
oh , here it is . dr. bailey operated on you .
yep .
okay , well--well , let &apos;s see what we have .
so you want to stop the bleeding ,
but you don &apos;t want to do a blind clamp
in a bloody field .
uh , your goal is to get control of the hilum .
since you won &apos;t have a stapler ,
you can get control by using finger pressure ,
like that .
so ... just reach in here ?
yeah , you want to feel for the bronchus
and then you &apos;ll know you &apos;re near the hilum .
matthew &apos;s mother is coming here .
i can &apos;t meet her .
i can &apos;t lie to a mother .
don &apos;t sell yourself short .
you thought you couldn &apos;t lie to matthew either ,
but somehow you had it in you .
what kind of grown man
gets his mommy to pick him up ?
they have a good relationship .
he respects women .
he has good values .
i think i &apos;m there .
okay , so if you don &apos;t have a clamp ,
you can just use your hand
and twist the lung on the hilar axis .
that &apos;s it .
i see it . thank you .
you know what ? he doesn &apos;t make fun of me .
he thinks i &apos;m brave .
he likes it when i babble .
he &apos;s a unicorn .
he &apos;s an amazing guy .
well , then you should tell him the truth .
i have this really cool technique for autotransfusion
that i would love to show you when you &apos;re done here .
not bad , huh ?
who needs a fancy splint when you have duct tape ?
it holds quite nicely .
27 new e @-@ mails about where my research goes next .
it should sound like a cash register to you .
can you go bug shepherd for his vote , please ?
oh , i plan to , and i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll get it .
shepherd knows we bought this hospital so that
we could all be the doctors we want to be .
i &apos;m not living my dream .
my dreams are big and bright
and filled with extremely shiny machines
that grow cartilage out of thin air .
i have that dream all the time .
since you have limited blood supply ,
you do this ...
and you &apos;re giving your patient
their own blood back .
do you want to give it a try ?
sure .
so ...
are you going to tell this man the truth
or include his mother in the lie ?
because i cannot get on that plane without some closure .
uh , i @-@ i am so sorry .
you do not need to bother with my stupid problems .
you have real problems .
courtship troubles
are everyone &apos;s troubles .
wooing my wife was very tricky .
well , how &apos;d you win her over ?
a picnic
of spiced lamb
under the cypress trees ,
almonds dipped in honey ,
the words of my heart .
dr. kepner ...
we went to see &quot; terminator 3 . &quot;
you were right . cristina only wants to be the cool aunt .
i &apos;m sorry . i wish i was wrong .
that &apos;s okay . what about kathleen ?
what about lizzie ? you two got along .
oh , i forgot about lizzie .
you know , i don &apos;t want to leave our kids
with somebody you forgot about .
well , she &apos;s the alternate .
well , it &apos;s a disaster plan . most disasters don &apos;t happen .
they do to us .
that &apos;s true .
we have survived
an unusual number of very bad things .
at this point , it ups our odds .
just send the papers .
uh , apparently we have never filled out
a health care directive .
the lawyer wants that , too .
oh , well , i mean , you know all of this .
i don &apos;t want to be a potato .
no extraordinary measures taken if it &apos;s obviously at the end .
he wants it in writing .
oh , it doesn &apos;t matter .
we both know you &apos;re gonna give me a lethal dose of morphine
the second i start to forget where my keys are .
i &apos;m not kidding .
before we knew my mother was sick ,
she couldn &apos;t remember anything i &apos;d ever said to her .
and i thought it was because she didn &apos;t give a crap about me .
i don &apos;t want to put my kids through that .
you &apos;ll give me a lethal dose , we &apos;ll hold hands ,
and i &apos;ll fade off into the night .
we will cross that bridge when we come to it .
more irrigation .
looks like i &apos;m gonna have to open this all up .
you doing okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
you sure ?
dr. bailey , don &apos;t get all weird on me
because you think you shattered my psyche .
i knew what i was asking when i took that test .
well , if you ever need to talk ...
stop it .
all right . fine .
how about we talk about the sloppy job you &apos;re doing
raising those crappy interns ?
there you go .
what , she sneezed all over my patients ,
now i have two post @-@ op infections ?
they have no judgment
or common sense .
mm . sorry to butt in , bailey .
i saw a patient of yours from a couple of weeks back .
post @-@ op infection , pretty extensive .
he &apos;s on i.v. antibiotics , but he &apos;s gonna need surgery .
you have time today or you want me to handle it ?
what do you mean , he ? he &apos;s a she , and i saw her .
i &apos;m dealing with her
after i deal with this post @-@ op infection .
it &apos;s not a she .
seth lepik .
it &apos;s not the same patient .
it &apos;s a third one .
three ? have you spoken to hunt ?
no , not yet . i thought it was just two .
look , i &apos;ll take care of your third patient .
you need to find hunt .
which intern was it ?
it &apos;s leah murphy .
dr. darwish , can i get you something ?
oh , no . i &apos;m ...
just looking .
it &apos;s quiet .
we don &apos;t have a lot of quiet anymore .
so there &apos;s been a big rainstorm back east ,
and your grandma &apos;s flight
isn &apos;t gonna be able to get in until tomorrow ,
so carol here from social services
is going to take you to a place
that you can sleep tonight .
why can &apos;t i stay here like we did last night ?
well , that &apos;s not going to work out .
i don &apos;t want to go with her . my mom and dad are here .
it &apos;s gonna be fine , okay ?
they &apos;re gonna give you a great dinner ...
and they &apos;ll probably give you ice cream for dessert ,
and they &apos;re gonna let you play video games , so ...
hey . hey , hey , hey . come on .
it &apos;s going to be fine . i promise .
okay , is that ...
better ?
yeah . uh , but , uh , practice it a bunch more times .
the faster you get in and out ,
the better your outcomes will be .
promise me you &apos;ll kill me with a lethal injection
before i start to forget where my keys are .
of course .
early .
not when i set the house on fire
because i forgot to shut the stove off
or when i &apos;m sitting in the rocking chair
in the corner of the nursing home .
i don &apos;t want my kids to go through what i went through--
mer , you had me at &quot; lethal injection . &quot;
wow . is that my door prize ?
okay , so you know i was working
with these two syrian guys today ?
they barely get any supplies anymore .
i mean , this is all they have to work with .
but the attendings all pitched in ,
and we figured out a whole bunch
of lifesaving procedures they can do .
that &apos;s great .
yeah . um ...
my point is ...
you think you need everything ,
but you don &apos;t .
we could get by without a lot of stuff , right ?
sure .
what exactly are we getting by without ?
my virginity .
i was ...
i was a virgin for a really long time ,
and then i wasn &apos;t .
uh , i ... really wanted to wait
for someone like you ...
for marriage , but i screwed up .
and i was just-- i was so scared to tell you .
but then i was watching these guys today ,
and they--they literally have nothing left ,
and they &apos;re making do .
and then i @-@ i just felt like i was being so stupid
to--to worry about this one little thing ,
li @-@ like--like you couldn &apos;t even get over it .
so ...
i guess i would be an ungrateful jerk
if i worried about your virginity
while there &apos;s a war going on somewhere and people are dying ?
that what you &apos;re saying to me ?
no , no . i @-@ i @-@ i didn &apos;t--
you didn &apos;t think i &apos;d be more hung up on the lying ?
&apos;cause i bet even in a war , people still value honesty .
he &apos;s still not awake ?
uh , no , not yet .
i gave him a bolus of d50 . we &apos;ll see if that helps .
why didn &apos;t you talk to me first ?
because i talked to russell about it ,
like you asked me to .
but you knew that i was concerned about this case .
you really want me to have three highly trained surgeons
supervising one man &apos;s recovery ?
it shouldn &apos;t be news to you
that we work as a team at this hospital .
oh , yes , and the entire team
is helping you save syria from itself .
i came up with , like , 14 ways of doing thoracotomy procedures
without a chest tray .
i didn &apos;t have time for a groupthink
on perfectly straightforward post @-@ op care .
tomorrow , you , russell , myself
will round on paul together , all right ?
are you serious ?
i am .
uh , dr. hunt , i need to speak with you .
could you give me moment ?
it has to be now .
and webber &apos;s in the o.r. with the third .
so we have no idea how extensive this is ?
all right . you and i are gonna need to talk to infection control ,
let them know what we know so far .
i need you to find all your charts from that day ,
figure out every patient you touched in post @-@ op ,
or anywhere , for that matter .
we &apos;re gonna need to call every one of them ,
have them come in , and exam them .
this is going to be a nightmare .
they &apos;re gonna fire me , aren &apos;t they ?
just go .
still unconscious ?
bummer .
it &apos;s okay . he &apos;ll wake up in a couple of days ,
if we can all relax and be patient about it .
good .
yeah , tell that to owen .
we may be losing leah murphy from the program .
did i like her ?
i think you said once that she didn &apos;t suck
as much as you expected her to suck .
oh . that &apos;s too bad .
you know , maybe owen doesn &apos;t like being chief .
what makes you say that ?
i thought he did ,
but lately , he &apos;s had a bug up his butt
about russell not supervising me .
you know , maybe it &apos;s because he misses teaching .
i mean , derek--he hated all that administrative crap
when he was chief , right ?
owen &apos;s had nothing but that for weeks .
maybe he feels like
he &apos;s losing touch with the medicine ?
or maybe it &apos;s because russell &apos;s not supervising you .
okay , i just agreed to off you
the minute you started acting dotty .
shouldn &apos;t you be on my side for the rest of the day
just as a courtesy ?
ross was working the pit today ?
yes . okay , i just took out an infected dialysis graft .
he saw the patient before i did ...
but he didn &apos;t scrub in with me
because he wanted to make sure your m.r.i.
was just the way you liked it .
hey , dr. webber .
someone just put a glioblastoma resection
on your schedule for tomorrow .
did you want to do that before or after your aneurysm ?
shane , you have to stop .
i am working with brooks now .
yeah , but she annoys you , doesn &apos;t she ?
i mean , you and i kind of get along .
brooks has an instinct for this that you don &apos;t have .
you make up for it with a ton of work .
well , if i &apos;m making up for it , who cares how ?
i care .
and you should , too .
you should find a specialty where you shine .
this is what i &apos;m passionate about .
doesn &apos;t that count for anything ?
she &apos;s better at this than you are .
and that means , to me , i have to teach her , not you .
you &apos;re gonna be a great surgeon .
go figure out where .
guy can &apos;t take a hint , huh ?
where are we going , sensei ?
we are going to check in on rachel dawson ,
see if her neuro exams have improved .
you went with spearmint gum this time .
yeah . you can smell it ?
mm . i can .
do you like spearmint ?
not really , no .
just use peripheral vascular instruments
if you don &apos;t have stuff for peds .
okay , so pass the umbilical tape around the vessel .
and then thread both ends
through the short rubber catheter
and place the hemostat .
there .
uh , could i borrow her for a moment ?
yes , but not for long , please .
uh , i would like to admit ethan dawson
to peds for the night .
oh , he &apos;ll be fine with social services .
kids go with them every day .
this kid doesn &apos;t have to .
owen , there &apos;s protocol for a reason .
yeah , but we &apos;re human for a reason .
i know that you &apos;ve taken a special interest in this kid--
why is everybody acting like
this is some kind of a character flaw ?
he ought to stay . he &apos;s sick .
i got a look at him when i checked his wrist .
short limb syndrome .
karev .
right . he &apos;s right .
uh , limited growth , excessive sleeping , and eating .
impulse control problems .
th @-@ these are all the symptoms of childhood .
can &apos;t be sure .
not until we confirm it
with testing and observation .
guys , guys , i love the enthusiasm ,
but it &apos;s not gonna happen .
all right .
cristina said she would pull the trigger
if it comes to that .
you &apos;re my wife .
can we make the decision together
if we &apos;re gonna throw in the towel ?
that sounds fair .
it &apos;s not gonna be easy on you if i start to lose it .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
you &apos;re a project even with all your marbles .
i brought you something .
you did ?
i had bailey do my genome .
you did ?
yeah .
high @-@ risk for liver cancer and prostate cancer ?
yeah . you &apos;re telling me .
male pattern baldness ?
late onset , apparently .
heroin addiction ?
i &apos;m a real prize .
it &apos;s all a crapshoot .
we didn &apos;t get one single definite .
we only got maybes .
ah , maybe we live forever .
maybe we do , and maybe i become a bald heroin addict .
honey , i &apos;m gonna get these bags down to the car .
uh , thanks , mom .
wrapping it up for the day ?
yep .
how about you let me buy you dinner ?
i want to bend your ear about a project i &apos;m thinking about .
you and everyone else
are free to submit your proposals in writing
to the entire board .
and then i will vote like everyone else does .
hell , maybe i &apos;ll submit one myself .
maybe i have an idea ,
but i &apos;m not out here hawking it to people at work .
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna write a proposal like you &apos;re supposed to .
um ... son ,
nobody &apos;s ever saying yes to your proposal .
you &apos;re the most powerful vote on the board .
you &apos;re the person who says yes to other people &apos;s ideas .
we still let you be a surgeon .
nobody wanted to take that away from you .
but your project is this hospital .
yeah , it &apos;s exhausting sometimes .
yeah .
you know something i learned when i was the chief ?
what ?
somebody offers to buy you dinner
while they talk your ear off
about something you don &apos;t want to hear ...
you say yes .
look at that . you &apos;re a natural .
oh , looks like you got this .
yes , but ...
not as fast as it could be .
practice , practice , practice .
thank you for all you &apos;ve taught us .
i wish it could be more . it feels like nothing .
if we will help even one child ,
it &apos;s everything .
short limb syndrome ?
yeah , we &apos;re not sure .
at this point , we &apos;re just admitting him for observation .
we &apos;ll know more in the morning .
thank you .
so got your own tv ,
they serve a chocolate pudding that &apos;s not half bad ,
and i &apos;m gonna see if i can scare up some comic books , okay ?
you okay ?
you just told the nurse i was sick .
yeah , you &apos;re ... fake sick .
the nurse knows that . even ...
all the doctors know it .
we &apos;re just pretending so you can stay here tonight .
there is nothing wrong with you .
is it fake with my mom and dad ?
no .
no , i wish it was .
my dad &apos;s still not awake ?
no , he &apos;s not .
is he ever gonna wake up ?
i don &apos;t know .
so ... you played soccer .
i did .
owen &apos;s been acting crazy .
i think this is why .
the left defender is crucial .
kids make you crazy .
yeah .
kinda cute , though .
dr. grey .
i &apos;m not gonna get fired .
we &apos;ll cross that bridge when we come to it .
no , it &apos;s worse than that .
dr. bailey , joyce is crashing .
what ?
dr. kepner , you have given us piles of supplies already .
this equipment is expensive .
yeah , but this will really help .
oh , and you should definitely take this .
it &apos;s an infrascanner .
it can detect a brain bleed .
are you sure this is all right ?
perhaps you need to talk to dr. hunt .
don &apos;t worry about it .
honesty &apos;s not all it &apos;s cracked up to be .
they say the truth will set you free .
what the hell do they know ?
the truth is horrible , frightening .
the truth is more than you can bear .
bailey said the second patient isn &apos;t responding to antibiotics .
so she &apos;s going to need surgery .
i just operated on the third .
he &apos;s hypotensive and still pretty unstable .
once murphy &apos;s identified
all her patients for the day ,
then we &apos;ll get them in here ,
make sure no one else is infected .
we &apos;re gonna need to make some kind of statement .
before this gets out there on its own .
the first patient , joyce basche ,
she didn &apos;t make it .
i thought that the surgery would get rid of the infection , but ...
you need to get cultures on the other two right away .
and we need to make sure that we &apos;re using the right antibiotics
so that this doesn &apos;t get out of control .
okay .
we just lost joyce basche .
dr. bailey ...
no , she &apos;s her patient . she should know .
leah checked all the charts .
she was only on two of the patients
that got the infection .
she never touched the third one .
what , is that supposed to reassure me ?
a woman just died .
it couldn &apos;t have been leah .
the only doctor who touched all three patients was you .
we &apos;re gonna need to get legal down here .
wait . any--anything could &apos;ve caused this kind of infection .
yeah , no--
well , we know that , but until there &apos;s an investigation--
no , um , i gotta go , &apos; cause i have two more people--
owen ?
dr. webber will deal with them .
yeah , this is dr. avery .
get me joelle geller from legal down here , conference room two .
i will ...
go over my notes .
sit down , dr. bailey .
no . m @-@ my patients are in danger .
dr. webber will take care of them .
i haven &apos;t even told joyce &apos;s husband that she didn &apos;t make it .
i know the man !
i don &apos;t need grey to tell him that i killed his wife !
dr. bailey , please sit down .
we &apos;re supposed to be straight with you ,
so be careful what you ask for
when you walk into a hospital .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m asking you to sit down .
because when you find out what &apos;s really going on ...
