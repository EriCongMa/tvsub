总监 夕橙橙
第七季 第五集
No, you shut up! Shut the hell up!
I... okay, I am listening. What? What are you trying to say?
Good. You listen to this, this is what I'm gonna tell you.
I can come to your house.
I can come to your neighbors' house.
You cannot!
I could come to your parents' house...
Sir...
and say that you welched on your debt.
You know where my parents live?
You took out money and you're not paying it.
I've paid every cent.
Yes,
you should... I can do that, it is not illegal
for me to do that.
You know why it's not illegal?
No, it is illegal.
No, no, I don't think you understand, Maggie.
No, I do understand. I don't think that you...
I have your Social Security number, Maggie.
I have your e-mail.
I paid my b... my...
I can ruin your life.
I paid my debts ok,
I paid every single cent!
Maggie, you're getting me angry.
See? They cashed it.
I-I deal with liars all day.
What?
And I thought you weren't one of them.
I have paid you $8,900...
You have not, Maggie, and I'm gonna come to your house
and I'm gonna knock on your door. And then I'm gonna knock
on your neighbor's door.
That... no...
You can't do that.
And I'm gonna say you welched.
Maggie, you took out a student loan and you didn't repay.
I can do anything I damn please!
I already paid you, sir!
I can garnish your wages.
I can call you at work!
I have paid you.
I already paid you!
Look, when you stop lying, Maggie,
I paid.
and want to get serious,
call extension 853, you got that?
Look, I paid!
I already p... I paid!
853. Until then,
don't kill yourself, lady, by k...
Sir...
... by stepping in front of some train, okay?
Just pay your debts!
What?!
That was yesterday. That's why I called Lucca.
She wants to stop the harassment.
May I?
Yeah. Um, Maggie,
this is Jason Crouse, our investigator.
Nice to meet you.
So-- you know how much we charge, Maggie?
Uh, yeah, Lucca said $150 an hour.
It's worth it if you can make him stop calling.
And this is A.P.Y. Collections?
Yes. Uh, Bob Bondi.
But I already complained to his manager
and he won't do anything.
Well, we can bring suit.
Often that's enough to scare them off.
But sometimes these places can be a bit intransigent.
And we would have to prepare for court.
I don't have a lot of money. I mean,
I'm still working temp jobs.
I should have gone to law school, like you.
Instead, I went to Colosseum--
worst educational experience ever.
But I can pay you a bit every month.
Bob Bondi, please.
Oh, you won't get him at work.
I'm not calling him at work.
Hi, is this Mrs. Bondi?
Hi. I work with your husband, do...
do you mind getting him for me?
Thank you.
Bob. Hey, how you doing? This is Jason.
No, I-I know you don't know me.
Hold on.
Strangely enough, Bob,
I know you.
Wait, wait, who...
You live at
1245 Rosalia Avenue, you have...
Who is this? How do you know that?
This is Jason Crouse, Bob.
I want you to focus.
I know your Social Security number,
I know your address,
I know your neighbors' names.
How did you get this number?
Here's what I need you to do.
I need you go into work today...
I'm calling the police-- I don't... I'm calling the police.
Okay. Go ahead.
We'll talk about your priors in California.
My priors? What are you talking about?
Background, Bob. I am talking about your background.
I'm sure your boss would be interested to know.
Neighbors might be, too.
Bob?
What do you want?
I want you to lay off of Maggie...
Uh, Rossum.
Rossum. She paid her debt.
I am looking at a cancelled check here that you guys cashed.
The account is settled, Bob.
Look, look, I'll try to get this straightened out,
but it's not just up to me, you got to know that.
Who's it up to, Bob?
My manager, Nelson Olstead.
I only do what he says.
Okay. I'm gonna contact him.
Don't call Maggie again, Bob.
I know your number.
I don't think it's over yet. I think they're gonna
just put someone else on her account.
So we show 'em her cancelled check.
No.
My guess is A.P.Y. is charging her twice.
That, or they're playing some sort of
a shell game with her money.
You can find out?
How many hours can I charge?
Four.
Okay. I will call you if it requires more.
So, our first case, good.
$150 an hour?
I had to say something.
What is our price?
$200 an hour.
On the next one.
I'd go higher than $200.
We need some working cash, mom.
I know. I'm doing my best.
A responsible governor.
What's that?
Dad. In Iowa.
I'm here because it's the state
neighboring my own.
And you're saying this has nothing to do with running for president?
No, what I'm saying is that at the moment I'not running.
But I do want to talk about pensions.
As a responsible governor,
I think we have to start the conversation
about setting limits and rolling back pensions.
Really? You're sounding more like Marco Rubio.
I think we should stop sounding like a Democrat
or a Republican
and start sounding like Americans.
I think that's what Americans want.
I think that's what we need now.
The partisanship that's going on
in this election is killing us.
So did you have trouble getting your desk in here, Dad?
Mm-hmm. Marissa, brightening up my day.
坚称不参选
This has not been focus-grouped. This is simply what I believe.
But aren't you just playing back-of-the-pack politics, Governor?
Saying something controversial and wild
to get press coverage?
Oh, my God.
What a disaster.
Well, I would not characterize
this as talking wild.
This is responsible fiscal accountability.
Look, the fact of the matter is is that unions have
far too much control in this country. They are strangling...
Hey.
Dad, I love you,
but this is an intervention.
Give me the remote.
Peter chose Ruth over you. You have to let it go.
What are you talking about? This is my job.
No, this was your job. They fired you.
What are you getting out of this?
I mean, besides this luxurious office?
I'm looking after Alicia.
This isn't about Alicia. You're getting back at Peter.
What are you talking about? That makes no sense.
I know.
And that's why you need to leave.
You watched his interview,
scoffing the whole way through,
but I don't see you going in there to tell him what he did wrong.
He's not here. He's in Iowa.
Then call him.
Then let's go.
Dad, you'll get a new job. You're desirable.
I've never been fired in my life.
I know.
And it hurts. I've been fired eight times.
It doesn't get easier.
Come on.
Give me the remote.
Ruth Eastman devised the strategy for that interview,
and it makes Peter look like an idiot.
The press is gonna have a field day. I can't leave
when there's a chance that Peter will come to his senses
and realize Ruth is foisting a losing strategy on him.
I love you. This is not healthy.
The remote, babe.
Glad you came in. Please, please, sit.
Thank you, Mr. Erickson.
Ronnie's fine.
Ronnie. Uh...
Well, I know you'll be mostly interfacing with Howard,
but as one of the three partners at Lockhart/Agos,
I just wanted to personally welcome you.
Well, thank you. And...
I understand you've been with the Food Service Union
for 33 years. Food and Commercial Services.
I... Oh, excuse me.
Oh, I do have to take this. Uh...
No, please.
Did you tell Ronnie Erickson I went to prison?
Do you ever knock?
He's acting like I'm a crook.
Did you tell him?! If the guy doesn't
take a shine to you, that's your problem.
You crossed a line, Howard.
You can't come barging in here
and accuse me of, what, truth-telling?
So you admit it.
Since when is truth- telling a crime?
You... you want to talk,
how about you, now?
I'll tell you what the problem is.
You do zero, Howard.
I'm the guy that brings in...
You sit around with your pants down, literally!
Nelson Olstead. I'm the manager of A.P.Y. Collections. Hello.
Hey, thank you for meeting me. I'm with Avon-Isolade,
a debt brokerage out of Gary, Indiana.
You want to buy my bad debt?
Come on, there's no such thing
as bad debt. Just bad collectors.
Let me ask you something, broker to broker.
You ever double dip any of these?
No. There's enough real debt.
We don't have to make it up.
I mean, debt collecting might not be glamorous,
but it's legit. At least the way I do it.
What about your other offices? What about Michigan?
We don't have a Michigan office.
Then why do I have this canceled check out of Muskegon, Michigan?
I have no idea, but we don't have any offices there.
Thank you.
The address you sent your checks to--
did it change recently?
What do you mean?
This check-- the-the most recent one.
How'd you know to send it to Michigan address?
What's going on?
Your last check was cashed at a Michigan bank.
There are no A.P.Y. Offices there.
It was from a voice mail.
You still have it?
This is a courtesy message from A.P.Y. Collections.
We're calling to let you know that the address
for remittance of your scheduled loan payments has changed.
It's not Bondi.
Please send remittances
to 390 Deerhorn Park. Suite 777.
Thank you.
Wait, that wasn't A.P.Y.?
That was a scam artist.
He either hacked into the A.P.Y. Network
or he bought your records.
Collection agencies are wide open to abuse.
So her last payment was to the wrong person?
Yes.
Oh, my God, so I really do owe $8,000 to A.P.Y. Then, don't I?
Yeah, legally.
I... There's got to be something I can do.
I-I can't pay it again.
Can I make an argument here, Mom?
Yeah, sure. What's up?
Okay, the settlement you won for the Chagall painting--
your payout was $4,000 for 20 hours of work
Right.
As opposed to $500,000
if it had been on contingency.
Yes, but the rules on contingency
for probate are very strict.
It would've been almost the same as our hourly rate.
Oh. Okay, well, I didn't know that.
But on these other cases, can't we start
taking them on contingency?
Sure, but the cases that come through the door
are too small. We want the money up front.
Maybe we shouldn't be taking such small cases.
Look, I want bigger cases too, Grace,
but we need to win the small ones to get the big ones.
Is there any way to turn the smaller ones
into the bigger ones?
Well, um, I don't know how,
but that sounds good.
I'm just worried about our bills
I know. I am too, honey.
But this is what starting out looks like.
What?
Could you get me everything you can on Colosseum University?
Sure. What's that?
It's a for-profit school.
It's about to be sold.
Does that mean money?
It might.
Well, I'll get right on it.
You admitted earlier. And now you're pretending
Uh, okay. Listen up.
you doing something to benefit this firm.
Come on. Sit down.
...guilty of telling the truth.
Am I the only one who's upset by this?
Is Howard Lyman really what this firm is about now?
You better watch it, buddy boy. I am this close
to filing suit.
In order to sue somebody,
you'd have to know how.
There he goes again,
undercutting me with ageist comments.
Oh, all right. All right.
What?!
Cary, can I have a word?
I am aggrieved,
I tell you. I am aggrieved.
You have to stop with the ageist comments, Cary.
What?!
Are you seriously siding with him?
Cary, you are not a member of a protected class.
Howard is.
I want
in-house mediation.
Howard, please.
I've consulted an attorney.
Who, Alicia?
I know my rights pursuant to my partnership agreement.
And if you refuse, my only recourse is to sue.
We're gonna keep trying
to get your money back.
But it doesn't look good.
But there might be a way to cancel out your debt entirely.
We've done some research on your university.
They've been subject to dozens of complaints
to the Attorney General's office.
They're a for-profit school.
They treat education like a product.
And based on what you've told us, it's a defective product.
You borrowed $46,000 for an education
that didn't yield a job.
You want me to sue Colosseum?
We want you to let us sue Colosseum.
They're about to be acquired by a private equity firm out of Texas.
A lawsuit would have to be disclosed to the potential buyer,
and that could tank the deal.
Look, I can't afford a big lawsuit.
We know.
That's why we're going to take this on contingency.
You don't pay anything.
Our payment comes from the settlement.
What do you say, Mags?
That's a nifty theory there, counselors.
It's not a theory. It's a fact.
Our client bought an education from you,
and it hasn't done what you said it would.
Where did you go to school, Mrs. Florrick?
Georgetown.
Did they teach you to read there?
Excuse me?
Our enrollment agreement.
Your client signed one.
And paragraph 23 is the...
An arbitration clause.
Oh, you can read.
It clearly states that any grievances must be settled
in arbitration and settled within 18 months of graduation.
Your client graduated 17 months ago,
so you do the math.
Where is she?! Ruth!
Did you see this?
Well, then, who the hell is my constituency!
I mean, look at this! And this one!
It's a nightmare, Ruth!
It's not, Governor.
Foot in mouth disease! That's what they're saying!
This is all part of a strategy.
Ruth, don't be ridiculous. This is a screw-up.
Calm down, sir.
Everything is under control.
Don't be ridiculous.
Is everything all right?
I was gonna show you this later, Mr. Governor.
After I got more information.
I saw the interview in Iowa.
Would you like to discuss it?
Is this real?
As real as anything, sir.
It's from our internals.
Look, if there's any way I can help...
You're in second place.
And climbing.
You're not selling yourself to the press, Mr. Governor.
They won't embrace you, anyway.
We're going right to the people.
Yes, you're saying controversial things.
Yes, it's the same strategy as the Republicans.
But it's working, and you're winning.
Ruth, I am so sorry I flew off the handle.
Terrific job!
Each day's an adventure.
Okay, now what's next?
What we're gonna do is keep pushing this anti-union message.
Next, we go to Illinois Management Coalitions...
Good morning.
Let me start by saying that this is not a courtroom
and I am not a judge.
But in all ways, the decision here is final.
Arbitration takes the place of litigation.
Mediation does not replace litigation.
It is an attempt to settle differences amicably,
which is in the best interests of the firm
and in your own best interests,
since you are partners in this firm.
Let's go around the table first, and...
please share your names and your most embarrassing experience.
That was a joke, people.
Uh, you have my permission to lighten up.
Why don't we start to my right.
Lucca Quinn. Representing Maggie Rossum.
Alicia Florrick. The same.
Carter Schmidt.
Representing Colosseum University.
Good. We got through that without an argument.
We're well on our way.
I'm Geoffrey Solomon. I'll be your spirit guide.
We will hear evidence and follow the admissibility rules
as determined by Rule 90
of the Illinois Supreme Court.
So, counselors, call your first witness.
Why does he get to go first?
I'm doing it alphabetically.
Eh. Convenient.
Cary, what are your grievances?
How are you... aggrieved?
He's embarrassing in front of clients.
That's code for "Old."
And he sticks his nose where it doesn't belong.
That's code for "Jewish."
You teach at Colosseum
in the dental hygienist program, Ms. Howe?
Yes.
And what subject did you teach my client?
Periodontics.
Are you a periodontist?
No. I'm a dental hygienist.
A licensed dental hygienist?
Well, I was. I may have let my certification lapse.
When?
Uh, a couple years ago.
13 years ago, actually.
And you were never licensed in the state of Illinois.
I know this isn't court, but I don't think
she can both ask and answer the questions.
Counselor.
How could my client have received an adequate education
if you're not a licensed hygienist?
Because I'm a good teacher.
All my students think so.
No further questions.
Where were you licensed?
Ohio.
And dental anatomy doesn't change
when you cross state lines, does it?
I don't think so.
Okay.
Nothing further.
Ms. Howe,
uh, this is a final exam you gave my client last year.
Can you please read the first question?
"What does the phrenic nerve innervate?"
What's the answer to that?
Objection, Your Honor.
Oh, no. I-I think we could all benefit from that answer.
The exam was multiple choice,
and you've put a piece of tape over all the choices.
Right. Uh, go ahead. Remove the tape.
We'll wait.
What's the answer?
"A."
No. Actually, it's "D."
Geezer,
gargoyle, old fart,
Flaccido Domingo.
That one hurt especially, given my devotion to the opera.
And, uh... and my sexual prowess.
And you would like this name-calling to stop?
Yes, I would.
I've spent 30 years in this business.
I think I deserve a little respect.
Diane, do you have a minute?
And where are you going?
We just need a moment, Howard.
Objection.
You cannot have an ex parte conversation
in the middle of our trial.
You're the one who called Howard an old geezer.
Okay.
I'm not the only one
guilty of a few indiscretions.
Cary, please. We're only going through this
to keep Howard from suing.
Are you sure you're not hanging me out to dry?
I want your ex parte communication noted for the record.
There is no record, Howard. We're just trying to clear the air.
And I think we have accomplished that,
I want to call a witness.
You can't call a witness. This isn't a hearing.
I call Diane Lockhart to the stand.
Hello, Father.
I want to run something by you,
but I need your undivided attention.
I'm thinking of taking pole dancing classes.
What do you think?
If it makes you happy, dear.
Do you know Eyal Naftali?
Is that a club?
He's the chief of staff to Israel's communications minister.
He wants to talk to you about running his campaign.
His campaign for what?
The Knesset.
And, in a few years, prime minister.
How do you know this?
I knew his daughter in the IDF.
Her dad contacted me.
I see what you're doing.
I'm giving you the chance to make an impact, Dad.
It's "Have" an impact, "Make" a difference.
You want Netanyahu out, here's your chance.
Mr. Naftali is offering you twice as much as you're making now.
How do you know what I make?
I'm a witch.
Talk to him, Dad.
What do you have to lose?
82% of Colosseum graduates find employment
within a year of graduation.
What employment?
What do you mean?
You said 82%
find employment within a year of graduating.
I'm just asking: what kind of employment
are we talking about here?
Professional employment? Fast food work?
Temping, like Maggie?
Any employment.
How many work less than 15 hours a week?
I have no idea.
Well, we do. 33%.
How many work minimum wage jobs?
We run a high-risk,
low-functioning population, miss.
Fifty-five percent.
Why don't you put that in your brochure?
Let's not badger, shall we?
The reality is the vast majority of Colosseum students end up
worse off than before they started.
They wind up unemployable and saddled with massive debt.
Please, Your Honor,
do we need the speeches?
No, we don't.
Counselor, is there a question here?
Nothing further.
President Stenborg,
you make it sound like you don't care
about the quality of the education.
Is that true?
No.
I care very much.
But I also care about running a successful business.
You supply a service.
Yes.
Traditionally, higher education is a product
marketed only to the elite.
And you're making it available to the masses?
Exactly.
If we didn't do it, these students would never get
into another institution.
Do you mislead prospective students?
No. We're not allowed to.
We're subject to the same laws every business must follow.
Our customers get exactly
what they pay for, no more, no less.
Okay, I think we can all agree that Colosseum is not Harvard.
Oh, that's not what we're claiming.
Yes, but you're focusing
on the ways in which Colosseum
doesn't measure up to traditional notions
of higher education.
No, we're focusing on deceptive practices.
Then I'd suggest you stop presenting evidence
on Colosseum being inadequate,
and instead focus on the ways they actually lied
to their students.
Can I help you?
Yeah. I was actually hoping
to rent out these offices, if they're not occupied.
They're open. Last occupant just used it as a mail drop,
and he took off a month ago.
How much square footage are you looking for?
Like 800,
but I'd love to take a look. Jason Crouse.
I run a skip-tracer business.
Sure. Nice to meet you.
Harrison Strode.
I manage this location.
A lot of people like the prestigious address.
Ah, here we go.
Well, the size is right.
Would you mind getting those shades for me?
Sure. It's $600 a month,
with utilities.
It's Wi-Fi ready,
and... the view is not bad.

Alicia, how's arbitration?
Not good. You busy?
Never.
The arbiter needs some lies that Colosseum tells its students.
Can you find something?
Sure. What's the time line?
Tomorrow.
All right. Let me see what I can do.
Great. Thanks.
Good-bye.
Surprise!
Marissa!
Hey, what's up?
It's been a while.
I know.
Your office looks amazing. I can't believe
you did this all without me.
I thought you were in Israel.
I was. Designing purses. Really cool.
Leather and macrame. But then I got worried
my dad was having a nervous breakdown.
About what? You being away?
No.
Do you have any cereal?
Sure.
What was I saying?
Your dad-- you're worried about him.
He's having trouble
letting go.
Running Peter's campaign was his life.
Well, he's my chief of staff now.
I know. I heard.
But...
you disapprove?
No. I just...
you know...
You're right, I don't approve.
Why?
He's about to pass up
an opportunity to run a campaign in Israel--
a big campaign-- because of you.
Well, I never guilted Eli into anything-- he wanted to stay.
I know. And that's why I'm hoping you'll fire him.
Marissa...
That's the only way he'll move on.
Convince him you don't want him. I know it's hard on you.
Don't do it for you, do it for him.
Please fire him.
What are you looking to major in, Jason?
I was thinking dental hygiene.
Are you guys accredited with the ADA?
Uh, well, I'll tell you the truth, right now we're not.
It's pending, but... You don't want to be a dental hygienist.
I mean, come on, look at you, a guy like you?
You like cars? We got a great automotive tech program.
Yeah? How do your graduates do in the workforce?
Uh... uh, look, you know, I can show you the stats.
We got time for that. But do you want to get some lunch?
You know, let me, uh... let me think about it.
Thank you.
Wait, Ja...
are you a vet?
Yeah.
Why?
'Cause I'm about to make your day.
See, most of our students, they got to come up
with at least ten percent of the tuition out of pocket.
But you, you get the golden ticket.
You got, you got Federal loans, plus the G.I. Bill.
Let me show you.
All right.
You got something.
What?
Ninety-ten.
I have no idea what that is.
You need to call this recruitment officer--
Randy Duffield.
What's his number?
No.
Call him as your next witness.
Mr. Duffield, can you please tell us about the 90/10 rule?
It is a Federal law that prohibits
for-profit colleges from receiving more than
90% of their revenues from student aid.
And where does the other ten percent come from?
From the students themselves. Their own private funds.
But there's a loophole, isn't there?
I'm not sure what you mean.
Veterans. G.I. Bill
and DOD Tuition Assistance-- that can be counted
as private money on the ten percent side.
I'm... not sure where we're going with this.
Our client, Maggie Rossum, is a veteran.
So veterans can go to Colosseum for no money out of pocket.
Do you target veterans
in order to take advantage of this 90/10 rule?
No.
Really?
Did you receive this e-mail
from Colosseum's head of recruitment last year?
It suggests that you lure veterans
from veteran hospitals and Wounded Warrior centers.
Objection as to "Lure."
Sure.
Find another word for "Lure."
Persuade.
Isn't it a fact that you persuade
poor, unqualified applicants
to take out loans they can't possibly repay?
That's just not true.
Nothing further.
Mr. Duffield, is Mrs. Florrick spinning your words?
Yes.
You believe in what you do? Look,
our students, they-they may not be the best and the brightest--
I'm sorry to say that,
but it's true-- but it doesn't mean
that they don't deserve a chance.
Thank you.
I'd like to call Maggie Rossum.
Did you or did you not, Ms. Lockhart,
suggest that I catheterize myself
at a client meeting which took place
in this very room less than a week ago?
You were getting up to go to the bathroom every five minutes, Howard.
Answer the question: yes or no?
Howard, we all make jokes, including you,
about everyone at the firm.
I'll take that as a yes.
Cary gets made fun of for his youthful appearance.
Twerp, pimple, preschooler.
And we've all made fun of David Lee for...
well, you know.
And I've heard you more than once joke
about the pole stuck about Diane's ass.
Excuse me?
No. Come on, that... that's different.
How is that different?
I'm not talking about harmless ribbing.
People...
pour prune juice in my coffee.
They leave adult diapers in my office.
Oh, come on, Howard.
What? They do.
No one is leaving adult diapers in your office, Howard.
I think he wants us to follow him.
"Property of Howard Lyman."
Huh?
And...
here's a...
a bib...
...and a catheter.
I had nothing to do with that.
But you're creating the climate.
Well, it's a diaper, Howard,
it's not a burning swastika.
These young associates, they look up to you.
They follow your cues,
and this is what they do.
They harass me. They...
they humiliate me.
Howard, I am so sorry.
And I want you to know we are gonna take meaningful steps
to correct this ageist culture
that we may have unwittingly fostered.
Would you consider yourself a good student, Ms. Rossum?
I don't know. I...
I did my best.
Good.
That's all any of us can hope for--
doing our best.
Now, in order to do your best,
you would need to show up for...
classes, right?
Would you agree to that?
Well, that depends.
It does?
You think you can be a good student
even if you don't show up for class?
I would object to that, Mr. Solomon.
I understand why, but no.
I think that you can be a good student in a lot of ways.
I understand why you would say that.
According to your attendance records,
you missed two-thirds of your classes.
Do you think that's accurate, or...
do you think it's wrong?
I had to work a lot to pay my bills.
What about books, the ones assigned for class?
Did you... buy any?
Did I buy any textbooks?
No, but I...
So aside from tuition,
what did you spend all that student loan money on?
They told me I could use that money for living expenses.
Living expenses incurred while you weren't
buying books or attending classes.
Looks more like a defective user
than a defective product.
Objection!
Objection!
He made it sound really bad.
That's because it is really bad, Maggie.
The credit card interest was eating me alive
paying off that card seemed like the smart thing to do. I...
and it wasn't illegal.
Well, maybe not.
But it still doesn't look good.
Did I miss classes? Yes.
But that's because I was working two jobs.
And I always got notes from somebody when I couldn't make it.
What about the books?
We'd get PDF versions,
print them out, pass them around. I mean...
we all tried to make the best of it,
we really did.
Who's "we"?
Um, my study group.
We'd just kind of share horror stories,
you know, job tips, that kind of thing.
How many students?
Look, we just need
to enumerate ways Colosseum lied to you.
We just need to wait.
I see you're running an adult day care now.
You wanted to talk?
Yes.
I'll get right to the point, Eli.
I just don't trust you anymore.
I need to be working with someone...
different...
someone who gets along with Ruth,
who has her confidence.
Did Marissa talk to you?
No.
Eli... you have an ulterior motive here,
and you know it-- you are using me.
Yes, but... you're using me, too.
I keep Ruth from messing with your life.
Well, I can do that on my own. No, Eli.
I really appreciate everything you've done for me,
but now...
we need to part ways.
You're serious?
Yes.
We both need a fresh start.
I know it won't be easy, but...
it's time.
Good-bye, Eli.
No, I agree.
I think maybe a class action makes sense.
Wait.
I'm not sure if we have the wherewithal...
Actually, a class action isn't possible here.
Why is that?
The enrollment agreement you signed.
When you registered at Colosseum,
you signed a document
saying you wouldn't sue the school.
I signed a hundred pieces of paper. Are you serious?!
We can really sign away our rights?
Unfortunately, yeah,
legally, you can.
Okay, so the school can screw all of us,
and then trick us into not doing anything about it?
A class action suit isn't possible, but a debt strike is.
It's already happening at another for-profit.
Corinthian College.
This is a list of 350 Colosseum graduates
who are ready to default collectively
and suffer the consequences,
unless you intervene with the Department of Education
and the loan companies to settle their debts.
Really? Getting desperate, are we?
It's a debt strike.
Let's see how that will play with your resale value.
Or you can settle.
We're listening.
Okay, now I need everyone
to take the cotton balls in front of you.
Pick one up, please.
Just one.
Okay,
now insert it into your right nostril, please.
Good and tight.
Okay, now take the cardboard glasses...
Look at him. He's enjoying himself.
They're coated with a diffused filter.
And put them over your eyes, please.
Now take the kernels of corn.
A handful will do.
And put them in each shoe.
Come on.
Sensitivity training. Let's be sensitive.
Ah, you know what?
I think Howard planted those diapers,
so we would have to do this.
Here we go.
Good.
Now I want everyone to walk.
And do something simple like tie your shoes.
Go.
It hurts.
This is what it's like to be 80 years old.
This is what it's like to walk.
Isn't that right,
Howard?
Sometimes... every day is a struggle.
I'm sorry I take naps, but now you know why.
All... all day, it hurts.
I think Howard could use all of your support right now.
This is not happening.
I think unions do have a place.
But if we're gonna stay competitive
in a global economy, then,
I think we have to look
beyond the standard management-labor paradigm.
Excuse me. Excuse me, guys.
Then you agree with your husband, Mrs. Florrick?
I do.
I think creative solutions are essential.
So you're against unions?
No.
But I support my husband when he says
he's looking for new ways to avoid strikes.
Then what do you think of your wife's debt strike, Mr. Governor?
Mr. Governor, I think we have To get into the ballroom.
Actually, you don't.
Your wife is organizing a debt strike
among the students at Colosseum University.
Well, I support my wife.
Even though she's unionizing?
I would rather look at the facts...
You are organizing a strike, aren't you, Mrs. Florrick?
Unfortunately, attorney-client privilege prevents me
from saying...
I think we've had enough here.
Oh, it's okay for your wife to strike, but not my union?
You gave Alicia the debt strike idea, didn't you?
You know Peter told me to keep a handle on the family,
and now we've got Alicia stirring up trouble
on an issue that's no-win for the campaign!
It's not no-win for the campaign...
Peter can't be saying
"Vote for me" in one breath, and "Don't worry
about paying back the federal government" in the next.
Oh. You know, you're right. I didn't think of that.
I guess he won't want to choose between
alienating the unions or business interests, either.
You're killing peter's campaign!
No, I'm not. I'm not running Peter's campaign.
Mr. Naftali, Eli Gold.
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't realize
it was so late with you there.
I've given your offer a lot of thought,
And, uh, as tempting as it is...
I'm gonna stay put.
Molly Tuff?
Yes?
Colosseum class of 2013?
Yeah. Who are you?
I think this is yours.
It's your payment on your student loan.
How'd you get it?
From the person who scammed you.
I'm a private investigator.
I have a client who fell for the same scam.
Sent her payment to that address, too.
I can't believe you got it back.
I never have luck like this.
Oh, my god.
What?
They just called yesterday with a new address.
Can I get that address from you?
Hello, jackass.
Eli. Hi.
I'm staying on.
Okay. Sounds good.
Mrs. Florrick,
I apologize if I'm interrupting.
What do you need, Mr. Schmidt?
Just to deliver this. Colosseum is suing
you and Lucca Quinn for tortious interference with contract.
A judge will probably knock this down.
I don't think so.
There's a colorable argument that we crossed a line
when we encouraged students not to pay back their debt.
We escalated, so, they escalated further, and now we need to...
Keep going.
No, I was gonna say deescalate.
Lucca's right.
The debt strike is working. Colosseum stock is falling.
Colosseum has not been willing to back down so far.
Not to us.
But what if it was someone they cared about even more,
that was applying the pressure?
You don't happen to know anything
about this shareholder derivative suit
that's been filed against us, do you?
Absolutely not, but...
If I had to guess, I'd say the theory is
that Colosseum's predatory recruitment tactics
are a violation of the school's
fiduciary duty towards its shareholders.
Am I right?
Uncanny.
Just to recap, you're now facing a debt strike
which is destroying your not-very-good name,
a shareholder suit which could bankrupt you in court,
and if either continues,
the feds are going to investigate and revoke
your eligibility to receive funding.
What do you want?
I'm sorry to bother you so late.
I-I just wanted to drop something off.
What is it?
Belongs to Maggie.
Her $8,000?
Yeah.
From the scammer?
Yeah.
How did you do that?
I persuaded him.
How?
By being persuasive.
You're not gonna tell me, are you?
I will tell you whatever you want to know.
I get to the end of the day, I'm so tired, sometimes I...
can't think straight.
That is why I drink.
What do you drink?
