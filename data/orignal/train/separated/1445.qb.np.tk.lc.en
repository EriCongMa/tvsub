so the five keys to investing wisely in a down real estate market are ...
keyp your cool ...
keyp informed ...
legwork .
i recently became a partner in a new agency ,
so i put together a seminar
to recruit first @-@ time home buyers .
i want to give &apos; em a step @-@ by @-@ step description
of exactly what i can do for them .
am i worried tha they might write it all down
and just do it themselves ?
quite frankly , i hadn &apos;t thought about it until just now .
do i really have to go to this thing ?
yes . you &apos;re a big part of today .
you &apos;re my support staff .
then why am i not getting paid ?
that is a good question .
and i think i &apos;m gonna text you the answer
on that cell phone we pay for .
honey , do you wanna practice your part again ?
uh , no . it &apos;s just one question . i think i got it .
yeah , but it &apos;s the most important question
because it launches me into my big finish .
yes .
that way , people leave excited .
oh , i think people will be excited to leave .
luke ...
why ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s for school .
i have to design a container that &apos;ll protect an egg
in a 1 @-@ story drop .
yeah , so , um ,
you thought you would go with an egg carton ?
what if the best idea was under my nose the whole time ?
you &apos;re gonna need to come down and clean this up now .
ugh ! i wouldn &apos;t have to do any of this
if alex would just let me use hers from when she took the class .
never .
that design is my intellectual property .
i think it has applications for unmanned space flight .
keep talking like that
and you &apos;ll go through life unmanned .
funny .
girls .
luke , honey , listen to me .
you &apos;re gonna need to do this project on your own .
and you can do it . just ... really think .
i &apos;ve got it !
what if i &apos;m the container ?
there &apos;s a thought . you could be ...
no , luke ! luke !
第三季 第十二集
okay , si , te quiero . mwah , mwah , mwah !
i understood &quot; crazy old witch , &quot;
&quot; go kill yourself , &quot; then &quot; i love you . &quot;
i &apos;ll never get this , how you all yell at each other .
that &apos;s how you know that your family loves you
when they feel free to scream at you .
oh , i guess i owe my ex @-@ wife an apology .
apparently , she was nuts about me .
darn it !
try the next one over a frying pan .
i could use some breakfast .
this is so frustrating .
at least you &apos;re getting your hands dirty for a change .
it is a nice break from the life of the mind i usually live .
that &apos;s the spirit .
plus it &apos;s a metaphor for the human condition .
aren &apos;t we all just fragile eggs
hiding behind bubble wrap and bravado ?
and we &apos;re back .
well , i &apos;m sure that your egg @-@ droppy thing
is going to be the best in the class .
except for luke &apos;s .
really ? our luke ?
but isn &apos;t he , like , a little , like ...
i bet claire &apos;s gonna help him ,
just like she did with his self @-@ portrait for art class .
there was life in those eyes .
it was haunting .
tell you what . i &apos;m gonna nip this in the bud .
you deserve a fighting chance .
hey , i &apos;m calling about that , uh , egg project the boys are doing .
parents aren &apos;t supposed to help out on that , right ?
why would the parents be helping ?
why do they cut grapes for 8 @-@ year @-@ olds ?
i figure if you can eat a chicken finger ,
you can tear your way through a grape .
again , dad ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , it just ...
bugs me , is all .
the point is , i &apos;m not helping ,
and i hope no one else is helping , either .
okay , dad . thanks for the heads @-@ up .
love you . bye @-@ bye .
well , my dad is doing manny &apos;s project for him .
he called to tell you that ?
oh , no . he called to tell me that he wasn &apos;t ,
which is exactly what you say when you are ,
but you don &apos;t want anybody to suspect it .
really ?
what would you say if you had issues with your father ?
claire and jay are incredibly competitive .
tennis games , card games , everything .
who knows why ?
claire is the son that my dad never had .
i mean , he just wanted someone to throw a ball in the backyard .
i did once , but ...
he did not attend .
looks like fun .
it was , but now it &apos;s hard .
oh , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re gonna do great , buddy ...
claire ?
uh , i am just showing interest in our son &apos;s project ,
which any parent would--
think ! think ... to do . thinking ... i am ,
that maybe i should stay here
in case luke has any questions .
do you think you can find somebody else
to help you with your seminar ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s a little last @-@ minute .
you &apos;re kind of irreplaceable .
well , i mean , it &apos;s just one question ,
and the seminar isn &apos;t for a few hours ...
hey , gloria ? quick favor .
okay . see you there . bye @-@ bye .
what was that ?
phil .
he needs help with a seminar that he &apos;s giving .
why can &apos;t claire help him ?
he didn &apos;t say .
i &apos;ll tell you why
because she &apos;s knee @-@ deep in luke &apos;s egg drop project .
she said that she was not going to help .
that &apos;s exactly what i would say to me
if i was helping my kid and didn &apos;t want me to know .
why would you be talking to you ?
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s unfair to manny .
the kid doesn &apos;t stand a chance on his own .
i &apos;m tagging in here .
jay , he doesn &apos;t need you to baby him .
i &apos;m just gonna give him a few tips .
kid , get yourself a snack .
okay , i &apos;ll cut him some grapes .
damn it !
not like that , jay .
like this . look .
it just irritates me , you know what i mean ?
we &apos;re meeting with prospective birth mothers .
we &apos;ve had a few of these meetings ,
and they &apos;re very nerve @-@ racking .
you want to look good ,
you want to make a good first impression
kind of like a first date .
actually , it &apos;s--it &apos;s the opposite of a first date .
you don &apos;t wanna have sex , but you do want a baby .
i have to say , lily is adorable ,
and such a good eater .
oh , not all the time .
she just happens to love my tuna salad .
tuna指二者共同的猎物--女孩 &#93;
dolphin safe , of course .
oh , who cares about that ?
well , i bet the dolphins do .
it &apos;s okay to eat tuna , but not dolphin ?
my theory is , a fish is a fish .
well ...
a dolphin &apos;s actually a mammal , so ...
eh , to @-@ may @-@ to , to @-@ mah @-@ to .
more like tomato , cow .
mitchell , can you help me with the scones in the kitchen ?
okay .
excuse us .
okay , this is not really about the scones .
oh , really ? you didn &apos;t need help carrying six scones ?
no , this is about your need to correct
everyone &apos;s every little mistake .
i am sorry .
i thought that she could use a basic biology lesson .
well , let me give you a basic biology lesson--
you and i can &apos;t make a baby .
so if she points to a lamp and calls it &quot; uncle george , &quot;
what are you gonna say ?
&quot; pleased to meet you , uncle george . &quot;
very good . now let &apos;s get out there ,
smile , nod , and get ourselves a baby .
okay .
and those are your five keys .
now if there are no more questions ...
ah , yes , the lovely home buyer right here
on the edge of her seat .
i was wondering ...
i was wondering ,
is there a sixth key ?
as a matter of fact ,
there is .
we &apos;ll work on that .
it &apos;s the key to the new home you &apos;ve purchased below market .
thanks to woosnum , keneally , and dunphy .
bravo !
fire the confetti cannon , drop the banner ,
autographs , autographs , autographs ,
and we &apos;re done .
we still have , like , an hour left .
can i go shopping ?
no . i @-@ i have vocal exercises to do ,
and i need you to do a sound check for me .
i was hoping we could go to my hair salon .
it &apos;s nearby . i didn &apos;t have time to finish my hair this morning .
really ? that just happens ?
ooh , and i can get my nailse done .
is it okay ?
okay . sure .
oh , oh !
could one of you guys stick this under a chair on your way out ?
one of the lucky attendees is going home
with a brand @-@ new mouse pad .
wait , wait , wait , wait !
i don &apos;t wanna see which chair .
i wanna be blown away like everyone else .
yes . now that is feng shui .
doesn &apos;t that feel better ?
oh , yes . it &apos;s wonderful for conversation .
yes , this is nice .
it gives the room a nice flow , which i &apos;m really liking .
sometimes , your furniture tells you where it wants to be .
yeah .
do you mind if i use your restroom ?
not at all . it &apos;s-- it &apos;s just down the hall .
just be warned--there &apos;s some furniture in there
that kind of likes where it is !
okay , i know it &apos;s killing you to do this whole song and dance ,
but i think it &apos;s going great .
cam , there &apos;s a limit , okay ?
we already promised her that we would show her son all 52 states .
oh , wow , you have a keyboard .
oh , yes . that &apos;s mine .
you &apos;re musical . i love that .
it &apos;s very important to me .
oh , well , you &apos;re preaching to the choir .
literally . i &apos;ve sung in several .
yeah , we sing to lily ... all of the time .
i wish i could hear you guys .
oh , well , that &apos;s very sweet .
no , now .
the baby &apos;s father is a musician ,
and i would love to know
that he &apos;s growing up in a musical househo .
okay .
great .
okay . now we are actually doing a song and dance .
okay , well , look at it this way--
we &apos;re not only adopting a baby ,
we &apos;re saving it from a life spent searching for east dakota .
oh , god .
this is acally nice .
this is actually very nice to lean on .
it broke again .
mm . yes , i saw .
we &apos;ll just need to double up on the cotton .
here , let me save you a step .
alex !
knock , knock !
dad ! hey ! what are you doing here ?
manny needs that solder iron i lent to phil .
one of the screws on his project keeps coming loose .
other than that , it &apos;s flawless .
huh . his latest test run , he dropped it off the roof ,
he walked downstairs , it hadn &apos;t landed yet .
i had nothing . i had to get in claire &apos;s head .
sometimes the best thing to do in race to the top ...
is grease the pole behind you .
wow . so manny &apos;s still working ?
luke finished a couple hours ago .
is that why all these eggs are on the floor ?
oh , well , you know , after so many landed safely ,
we thought we should test &apos; em ,
make sure we weren &apos;t working with a super strong batch .
sounds like you knocked it out of the park .
oh yeah ! we did .
um , so dad ,
if i find out what phil did with that soldering iron ,
i &apos;ll run it over .
great . . &apos; cause , uh ,
we &apos;re gonna test it later today at the school .
fun . maybe we &apos;ll meet you .
we can come anytime , right ?
cause we don &apos;t have a @-@ a spring problem .
run 5 ?
perfect .
okay . bear with us . we &apos;re a little rusty .
yes , and please put all cell phones on vibrate .
* don &apos;t go breaking my heart *
* i couldn &apos;t if i tried *
* honey , if i get restless *
* baby , you &apos;re not that kind *
* nobody knows it *
* nobody knows *
* when i was down *
* i was your clown *
i really am a clown .
* i gave you my heart *
* so don &apos;t go breaking my heart *
* i won &apos;t go breaking your heart *
* don &apos;t go breaking my *
* don &apos;t go breaking my heart.yeah *
thank you .
it was wonderful .
oh . i &apos;m confused , though .
i thought cameron was the singer .
yeah .
yes , yes , i am .
really ? because mitchell has such a lovely voice .
well , i think he was following my lead .
you know , a good leader can make all the difference .
actually , you were a little pitchy .
but it was terrific , really .
thank you .
yes . thank you for your opinion .
faster ! faster ! we &apos;re going to be late to your father .
why did you have to do your toes , too ?
well , there &apos;s this really cute boy at school
who &apos;s kinda into my feet .
be careful . that can get really creepy fast .
ay . where is the car ? i parked it here !
it &apos;s a tow zone .
somebody just put that there ,
because that wasn &apos;t here when i parked !
it looks pretty old to me .
haley , don &apos;t lie . that was not here !
ladies and gentlemen ...
get ready for one of the giants
of residential real estate ...
a salesman &apos;s salesman ...
where are you guys ? i &apos;ve been calling you !
a realtor &apos;s realtor ...
you were supposed to do my intro .
now i have to .
2 @-@ time non @-@ consecutive winner of the realtor of the year award ...
just get back here by the end .
future investors ,
stop making excuses !
and start ... making your dreams come true !
ladies and gentlemen , phil dunphy !
how are you ?
thanks , mike . i appreciate it .
welcome .
taxi !
you see ? they don &apos;t stop because i &apos;m latina .
or because that was just a yellow car .
my dad is gonna freak out .
you have to take the blame for this .
why me ?
oh , because he &apos;ll never get mad at you .
he totally puts you on a pedestal .
that &apos;s not true .
yeah , it is .
let me just call the cab company .
taxi !
it &apos;s not rocket science , people , it &apos;s just a little red card .
okay . i guess nobody needs a mouse pad .
how &apos;s my favorite kid doing ?
favorite ?
yeah , i know , we &apos;re not supposed to have favorites .
but you know what ? we do .
and the good news is , it &apos;s you .
i &apos;m not giving you my design .
who said anything about giving ?
we can work out an arrangement .
it &apos;s cheating .
what do you want ? money ?
i got a little something set aside .
okay . i shouldn &apos;t even be giving you this hint ,
but , first get a mirror .
a mirror ?
then you &apos;re gonna look in it ,
and you &apos;re gonna see a crazy woman .
she needs your help .
you know , i made the egg that made you ,
that made that project ,
so in a lot of ways , that design is already mine !
oh , you &apos;re fine .
are you sure that there are no more questions ?
no more questions ? yes !
if we could just get that over to the mustachioed gentleman .
yes , i was--
oh , hey , i think we &apos;re all tired of that sound .
let me just come to you .
i bet i know what your question is .
you &apos;re probably wondering
if there &apos;s sixth key .
no , i was wondering about--
i was wondering about accelerated escrow .
if it works for both parties ,
it &apos;s a great way to expedite the deal .
but back to your first question
about this mysterious sixth key .
i didn &apos;t say anything--
the sixth key is the key
to the new home that you purchased below market .
using the simple principles that you learned here today ...
but not so simple that you don &apos;t still need
the professional services
of woosnum , keneally ... and dunphy !
thank you for coming .
son of a--
so is--is there anything that you &apos;d like to know about us ?
i don &apos;t think so .
in fact , i don &apos;t think i need to interview any more people .
you guys are perfect .
are--are you saying what i think you &apos;re saying ?
i &apos;m not supposed to say anything to you directly ,
but i think you guys should be expecting good news .
aah ! oh , gosh !
oh , i know , i know , you &apos;re not saying anything !
but what you &apos;re not saying is wonderful !
um , all right . i &apos;m gonna get some sparkling cider ?
yes , yes . okay , okay .
it wouldn &apos;t be a celebration without cider
or a celebratory song .
but this time , i want you to sit right here .
so have a seat here .
let &apos;s just get this mop out of the way there .
* if you leave me now *
* you &apos;ll take away the biggest part of me *
* ooh , ooh , ooh , no , baby , please don &apos;t go *
* ooh , ooh , ooh , no , i just want you to stay *
yes , she was upset , but on a positive note ,
what i take from this experience is , i can sing .
uh , what we didn &apos;t take away from the experience is a baby ,
because she decided to keep it .
no . did we missed everything ?
yeah . they cleared out of here pretty fast .
bummer .
more than a bummer , haley .
this was really important to me , and you blew it .
ay , no , phil , it was my fault .
it was not her fault .
okay . what &apos;s done is done .
can you take the brochures out to the car ?
wow . it &apos;s still full .
yeah , it is .
so it was not very good ?
um ... no .
i kind of need to sweep here .
okay . but--but i &apos;m so sorry , phil .
it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not okay .
we came late and we ruined your whole presentation .
these things happen .
yeah , it happens , and people get angry .
gloria , it &apos;s fine .
no , it &apos;s not fine !
i &apos;m trying to have a real conversation ,
and all you do is put me on a pedestal !
wait a minute . you &apos;mad at me ?
yes , because that &apos;s not how family &apos;s
supposed to treat each other !
you know how family &apos;s supposed to treat each other ?
they &apos;re supposed to actually think about each other !
i asked you to do one thing ...
and you were too selfish and irresponsible
to come through for me on a day that , believe it or not ,
was really important to me !
oh , my god . you &apos;re crying . i &apos;m so sorry .
no ! that &apos;s what i want !
you yell at me because you love me !
well , you made me mad .
and you should be .
well , i &apos;m not anymore .
don &apos;t treat me like that , phil .
because now i &apos;m furious !
ay , mi familia ! si .
oh , how do you do that ?
it makes me so ...
mad .
that &apos;s a pretty nice piece of handiwork for a 13 @-@ year @-@ old .
yeah , luke did pretty good , too ,
for a kid who still needs help getting out of his backpack .
still your grandson .
felt bad when i said it .
okay , let &apos;s do this .
watch out , kids ! they &apos;re coming down !
one , two , three .
how &apos;d we do ?
both eggs are okay .
great . so we both win .
unacceptable .
we &apos;re going up another level .
absolutely . come on . third floor .
meet us there , alex . let &apos;s go .
wait .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
the assignment was for a 1 @-@ story drop .
we both get a &apos;s .
we &apos;re doing this .
i don &apos;t like this .
the two of them talking up there--
they &apos;re gonna figure out what we did .
we did what we had to .
we &apos;re gonna get caught .
look at them down there .
they &apos;re not even paying attention .
this is the best part .
actually , manny looks kind of upset .
why would he be ? he &apos;s about to kick luke &apos;s butt .
oh , knock it off .
luke and manny had as much to do with this project
as they did with the manhattan project .
you think that &apos;s what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re upset because we took over for them ?
maybe .
they were supposed to--to learn from this ,
and--and we ruined it .
we should go talk to them .
yeah .
boys , we need to talk .
oh , god . oh , god .
just stay frosty .
so , uh , we realized couple things up there ,
and i think apologies are in order .
ok , we admit it .
we tricked you into doing our projects for us .
what ?
this is the first i &apos;m hearing of this .
we knew you &apos;d do all the work
if you thought you were competing with each other .
so i told you i thought claire was helping luke ,
and then you called claire ...
which got me involved , and ...
all right . here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen--
you &apos;re gonna get in the car , we &apos;re gonna drive home ,
and you &apos;re each gonna do your own projects .
fine .
you know , this is your fault .
what ?
the way we compete with each other it &apos;s--is sick .
it &apos;s so sick , two 13 @-@ year @-@ olds
know how to take advantage of us .
and you know what ? you made me this way .
how do you figure that ?
dad ! you pushed me into sports .
you never let me win . you know , that stuff--
it does something to a girl .
for your information , you came out of the womb like that .
i &apos;m not entirely sure there wasn &apos;t a twin in there
you bumped off .
if you saw that in me , why didn &apos;t you discourage it ?
why would i discourage something that i love ?
really ?
you kidding ?
you &apos;re a fighter .
the thing i love about you is you never give up .
dad .
even though i clearly designed a superior egg container .
out of your mind , old man .
only one way to find out .
give up .
you &apos;re all just playing for second .
there &apos;s something wrong with that one .
i &apos;m not wrong .
mom can be crazy , right ?
hello !
thank you .
at the same time , i feel guilty when i get mad at her .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s weird .
just really proud of my project .
i don &apos;t wanna share it .
everybody has his own thing .
thanks , haley .
i know it might sound dorky ,
but this late @-@ night conversations really mean a lot to me .
they &apos;re the only time that i feel like i ...
ok , corey , just one picture .
hold on .
my feet look fat from this angle .
hey , alex , wake up .
