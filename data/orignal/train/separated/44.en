Hello.
Alicia Florrick's... office.
May I help you?
Hello. Is Alicia there?
I am sorry, but Alicia is away from her desk at the moment.
May I take a message?
Yes. I...
Who is this?
Uh, this is Owen.
Who is this?
Diane.
Diane, hello.
Would you like to leave a message of some specificity?
Uh, yes. I would.
Thank you.
Uh, tell Alicia to phone me back, please.
Thank you.
I don't think this is a good idea.
We want Eli's business.
Eli goes where the Florricks go.
Hello.
Hello. Alicia's not in.
I see.
And you're...
I'm Alicia's brother, Owen.
Oh! Hey!
I'm sorry. I-I didn't know you were,
I... I'm Will. Her... boss.
Her boss. That-that's impressive.
Nah, I try not to flash it around a lot.
How's my sis doing, as a lawyer?
Good. Great, really.
Well, don't tell her that.
She-she works best when she's worried
that she's not living up to other people's expectations.
That's good to know.
As soon as I hear something, I'll let you know.
I brought you something from Botswana.
How... nice.
And here I thought you were gone for another two weeks.
Came back early. Isn't that fun?
We've been getting better acquainted.
Okay. So that makes me nervous.
So I'll let you two talk.
Just one quick thing.
The Murphy&Gomes suit?
Yeah, we're... we're right on target.
No, some...
Murphy's son.
He got picked up last night at Cook State College on a drug charge.
Prescription stimulant-- small-time.
But I guess it's quite the thing to do during finals week.
First offense?
Yeah. A 1410 at the worst.
Look, I could put a junior associate on it,
but Murphy&Gomes is such a cash cow.
No, no. Don't worry about it. I've got it.
Kalinda will phone when she finds out where he's being processed.
Owen. It's really nice to meet you.
Oh, nice to meet you, too, Will--
what was it again?
Gardner.
Gardner, of course.
That's a familiar name.
What happened, Owen?
You're supposed to be on vacation.
Okay, look, I broke up with Kevin.
It's not a big deal, but I just don't want to have a big harangue about it.
Oh, Owen, I thought Kevin was the keeper.
He was.
He's not anymore.
May I?
Oh, please.
What happened?
He cheated on me.
When? On vacation?
You know, I don't even care.
I'm just going to live alone,
like an aging writer with dogs.
Open your present.
So, are you hiding out?
Yeah, on your couch. Open your present.
It's an Mbukushu wig,
worn by African women when they work.
Put it on.
How thoughtful.
Yeah.
Drexel and 61st Street.
His name is Jonathan Murphy, 22.
How long ago?
An hour.
They won't agree to a 1410 until he IDs the dealer.
What? Why?
Ah, it's a slow Friday.
They're being hard-asses.
I'll be right there.
Don't pick a fight with Peter.
I'm only an hour behind you.
Look at you, going off to war.
Don't forget your headdress.
Two?
Yep.
Jonathan and his girlfriend,
Alexis Symanski.
They've been together for six months.
Does she have a lawyer?
Nope. She can't afford one.
Hey. What's the holdup?
What do you think?
ASA involvement.
Hey, I can't even wipe my nose without ASA giving the okay.
We'll be okay.
Doesn't work that way.
Yes, it can.
And since when did I become the optimist here?
Sorry.
Hi.
I'm your father's lawyer, Alicia Florrick.
You're Jonathan, is that correct?
Jon. Yeah, hi.
And you are...?
Alexis.
I'm with the firm representing Jon's father,
but I can also process this for you if you'd like.
Thanks.
Okay. So you were both picked up
for buying prescription drugs for private use. Is that correct?
I was. He was just...
No, that's not true.
Look, I needed to stay up late and study for finals.
I work two jobs.
No, don't listen to her.
She doesn't take drugs.
I was the one who suggested getting them.
Okay.
What you two just did there is fine for me,
but don't do that in front of the police.
Okay.
Look, the State's Attorney
will offer a 1410 probation citing.
That's a case that remains active but with no conviction.
Then Jon will have a record?
For some time.
It's just, um, we both want to go to law school.
Will you excuse me?
Don't worry.
I'm not here to make your life harder.
I just need an ID.
Are there any other ASAs in the District Attorney's Office,
or are you the only one?
I'm the only one assigned to
Lockhart&Gardner cases.
Hey, Kalinda.
Cary.
So here's the deal, Cary.
We ID your drug dealer, we get drug school,
no record.
Okay. I can agree to that.
Why?
Why can I agree to that?
I don't know. You want me not to agree to that?
Well, I want you to tell us what's up.
Well, we think this dealer killed a pharmacist
last night during a burglary, and we think
these kids can help us catch him, or her.
Sketch artist or photo array?
Photo.
So you have someone in mind, then.
We do.
We think this dealer is a known associate of a name
from your past, Lemond Bishop.
You want my client to ID a lieutenant
for the most dangerous drug gang in Chicago.
I want your clients to do their civic duty.
So, why don't you two take a minute?
Make the deal.
Cary can make their life miserable.
Nail them on possession.
Bishop won't touch Murphy's son.
Who?
His girlfriend.
And she's our problem, why?
Girlfriend, boyfriend, they seem to come as a package.
Yeah... have Kalinda look into
their antigang protections, and keep me in the loop.
Make the deal.
Will Gardner, lawyer extraordinaire.
Yeah, I got a new tie and everything.
So, can I kiss you here,
or is that unprofessional?
So, you ready?
I was born ready.
Thanks for arranging this.
Rodney!
Hey, Tamara.
So this is the guy I was talking about.
Mr. Washington, Will Gardner.
Sorry, I don't shake lawyers' hands.
He's-he's joking.
Derrick Rose already has an agent,
two business managers, three lawyers and me.
Why does he need a fourth lawyer?
Career longevity.
We stay with him no matter what he does.
Well, Derrick was asking about you.
He was not.
A book, movie, more sponsorships,
no matter what.
Okay, well, I'll talk to Derrick about it.
And I'm going to have him call you.
Stop, stop.
I need to get your pants off.
It's me.
Alicia's not here.
Yeah, she... gave me her keys.
I'm here to stay the night.
Notice the suitcases?
Well, then, you'd better come in.
Fun times.
Him.
He looked a bit different, though, without the sideburns.
Good. Good.
That's... that's helpful.
And did you see him the night before,
on that corner, around 11?
No.
So you two were near that corner.
No.
I mean, we didn't see him there,
but not because he wasn't there,
but because we weren't there.
You were... where?
Where were you two?
In the library.
In the library.
Both of you.
Yeah. Yeah.
Why?
No reason.
Okay. I may need you two to stick around for a lineup.
Hey, I was just trying to phone you.
Yeah, something's weird here.
I just checked on antigang preparations.
There are none.
There are...
What do you mean?
There's no investigation of a dealer.
It's all a scam to get our clients talking.
That's it. We're done.
Get up, both of you.
No, please stay.
Get up now. We're out the door.
No.
You are. They're under arrest for murder.
What?
For the murder of the pharmacist.
So how long have you known Derrick Rose?
Are you really getting jealous of Derrick Rose?
How positively charming.
I have a better average from the free throw line.
See? TV.
I see that.
Square knobs.
You know, if it were between you and Derrick Rose...
Derrick Rose?
Yeah. Sorry.
A girl has to keep up her standards.
But you and me, we're having fun, right?
I am. Are you?
That's why I'm still here.
I have to get that.
I know. Then do.
Derrick would have no problem with that.
Yeah.
They're being accused of murder.
Who?
Jonathan Murphy and his girlfriend.
Prescription drugs were traced to a pharmacy
that was burglarized last night.
The pharmacist surprised the burglar
and was shot-- killed.
Okay, I get it. Kalinda's on it?
Yeah, but I need backup.
On my way.
And you're on your way.
I'm sorry. It's an important client.
I wouldn't do this for anyone.
Have fun.
Maybe I'll give Derrick a call.
It's good that you called.
We can find a better price with the full floor.
All right.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Who was that?
Alicia.
Did you ask her?
No. It's about Murphy/Gomes.
Murphy's son is being accused of murder.
He what?
Will is on his way to help.
Murphy/Gomes could mean a lot if he came with us.
We'll be in touch.
It'll go fast.
In this market? I doubt it.
We'll be fine.
I know. I love you.
I love you, too.
We're holding them for questioning.
We haven't charged them yet.
Yeah, well, either charge them or let them go.
Maybe you haven't heard.
Murder one, the execution of a robbery.
With weak and tangential evidence.
The jars of prescription pills
found in Alexis's room had bar codes.
These bar codes link them to the Colton & Lowell Pharmacy,
where Andrew Lightbox, a hardworking American citizen,
was murdered at 11:00 last night.
Which only goes to connect her, not him.
When the police subsequently searched Jonathan Murphy's room,
they found more of the same.
Searched? Did the police have a search warrant?
Hey, it's a reunion.
And, no, they didn't.
They are campus police.
They don't need a search warrant
to canvass any on-campus dorm room.
Yeah, that's right. Get Kalinda on it.
Come on, Cary. They ID'd
the drug dealer as one of Bishop's crew.
Yes.
All of these men are members of Bishop's crew.
They also all happen to be dead.
Nice sleight of hand, Cary.
Hey, I learned from the best.
So, here's the thing--
only one of your two clients pulled the trigger.
So I could charge them both,
I could prosecute them both, but I have a deal for you.
Burglary for the first one who turns on the other.
Burglary, first offense-- eight months.
Murder during the commission of a robbery-- 25 years.
Yep.
First pie out of the oven.
So, the question is, who wants to get out of prison
in time for their 22nd birthday?
And who wants to get out for their 48th?
We play this out.
Keep listening to Cary.
Keep him talking.
We don't say a word.
The right to remain silent
does not mean the right to not listen.
And we'll see what you can dig up.
We should phone Blake, too.
We need to keep her on the reservation.
Alexis?
Yes, Alexis.
You and Julius represent her.
Alicia and I will take him.
Cary's playing this like the prisoner dilemma.
One prisoner gets so paranoid the other will flip,
they both race to flip.
But we keep in touch.
We don't get paranoid.
If we both remain silent,
he has to make a case.
And he doesn't have one.
And Murphy's son?
What if he's the triggerman?
Well, I think you know who we need to protect here.
Is Alexis all right?
She's fine.
We're going to represent both of you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Look, Jon, your first instinct here
will be to lie to us.
Your second instinct will be to lie to us, too.
So we need your third instinct.
We're not your confessors.
We're not here to judge.
We're your lawyers.
We just need the truth in order to know how to act.
So what happened?
Nothing.
It was stupid.
We heard about a place
where you could go get something to keep awake.
So we went.
For finals.
A lot of kids were doing it.
He's lying.
I don't know why.
I don't think they did it.
He might be trying to protect her.
And she's protecting him.
They're going to protect each other right into prison.
So how do you know you're gay?
You mean before or after I fellated my first guy?
I don't like that word.
I'm sorry. Before or after I fellated my first man?
You don't have to answer if you don't want.
I knew from a very young age.
High school.
So you think you were born gay?
Do I think I was born gay? Yes, I do think.
What I don't understand
is why it's so important to say people were born gay.
If it's so good,
people should be allowed to choose it, shouldn't they?
They should think it wasn't forced on them.
They would just prefer it.
But it isn't about "Should;" It's about biology.
Well, yes... Well, I don't think it is.
I think people want to think it is.
Okay, my turn.
Why do so many old people read Reader's Digest?
The big type.
Isn't this fun?
We're sharing deep truths.
I saw Grace holding hands with a girl from school.
Oh... my God.
You can make fun,
but I think it's
too early for her to know if she's gay or not.
I'm afraid she's making a choice that she'll regret.
Regret?
Don't take it personally.
Sure. Why would I?
Look, they were holding hands, Jackie.
Girls hold hands.
In Grace's room.
Girls hold hands in rooms.
On her bed, after a sleepover.
Let her through.
Thanks.
I thought I'd just see how you guys were...
You don't have to tell a story, all right?
We're here to show you everything.
The ASA says you'll find it anyway.
Okay, then, show me everything.
You need one of these to get into the library.
Your client says they were in there at 11:00--
the time of the murder.
I think he said around 11:00.
It doesn't matter.
There's a computer that keeps track
of everyone entering and exiting.
Here's a copy for you.
I'm guessing this is not going to end well.
Well, it does for me.
Last time your client was in the library was a week ago.
Bye-bye, alibi.
Who's that?
Campus police.
Getting older every year.
Is he the one who found the pills?
It was a legal search.
I'm sure it was.
Do you mind if I just have a chat with him?
Damn. I thought at least their alibi would hold up.
I'm talking to the campus cop.
They're always good for an infraction or two.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes?
I'm Eliza Symanski, Alexis's mother.
We're doing this pro bono, ma'am-- free--
because we have a relationship with the Murphy family.
It's serious, but we can't tell how much is police overreach.
Overreach?
Are they overcharging?
Was it just a drug charge they're trying to inflate
to a murder?
Do you need some water, ma'am?
No, thank you.
She's a good girl.
She would never do anything like that.
That's good to know.
Just know, Mrs. Symanski, we're on the case.
You could go with a public defender,
but we will put all our resources into this.
I think I will take that water.
Certainly.
At a certain point, you have to wonder if this is right.
Tricking that woman into thinking you're on her side.
Let me get this straight.
You're criticizing us for using tricks?
I don't apologize for lying to two punk kids who killed a man.
Two punk kids-- really? Have you looked at them?
We've both dealt with enough criminals
to know the killers look exactly like the victims.
So you have a master key?
Yep. All the campus cops do.
So when you entered Jonathan's dorm room, you were looking for drugs?
Yes.
Don't mind me. I'll just sit here.
Other students reported prescription drugs being sold by Mr. Murphy.
Sold, not used?
Yes.
Congratulations, Kalinda.
You just added a year to their sentence.
And where'd you find the drugs?
There, under the bed.
In there?
Can you show me how you found the drugs?
Sure.
Yeah, I come in the room, I look around,
I see the gym bag there.
I zip it open,
saw the drugs.
You zipped open the gym bag?
Yeah.
Why?
Search of the dorm room was legal,
but the moment you unzipped Mr. Murphy's gym bag,
the search became illegal.
Better phone Cary.
Thanks a lot.
It's going to be a long night.
Yeah, I got it.
1410 probation for the both of them.
It's a technicality.
You guys just love saying that.
The whole Constitution is a technicality.
Okay.
Three months.
First one who flips gets three months.
Cary, think about it. Why would we do that?
Diane's in one room, I'm in the other.
You lost.
Don't let your ego do the thinking.
So they're not charging you?
Excuse me?
The, uh, law firm...
Lockhart&Gardner, they're not charging you
for representing your daughter?
Yeah. Why?
Did they tell you I have a deal on the table?
If your daughter takes it,
she gets three months probation as opposed to 25 years.
On the other hand,
if their paying client takes the three months,
your daughter gets 25 years.
So, that's a difficult position to be in-- representing both clients,
especially when only one of them can benefit from a plea bargain.
I just want the best thing for my daughter.
I know,
but they're trying to scare you
by saying it's them or a public defender,
and there are respectable law firms out there
that do pro bono work.
So, I could give you a name if you want.
No.
Yep. You've just been fired.
By who?
Mrs. Symanski.
I think it's for the best.
Yeah, for the best,
but thank you for all your hard, selfless work.
I'll take it from here.
Eight months to the first one who flips.
Good night.
Owen, it's me.
You have my keys, remember?
Hello.
Hello.
Having fun, are we?
I have had a drink, but I'm fine.
I'm doing laundry.
Okay.
What have you done to my mother...?
No, no, that...
That is your perception.
Well, you know, I can't... I can't help you with that.
Oh, okay, yeah. No, believe him and not me.
That's fine.
That is great.
Hey. How'd your thing go?
Not well.
Was that Kevin?
Yeah. He told me to tell you hello.
I drank all your tequila.
When did you start drinking tequila, anyway?
You should go to him.
To Kevin? No. Why?
He didn't cheat on you, did he?
Just go to him and say you're sorry.
Yeah, well, what if I'm not?
Lie and say that you are.
Oh, come on, Alicia.
We don't all have to be like you.
Not everybody's required to be committed for life.
Oh, really?
The silent Alicia treatment.
Really?
Is that what we've descended to already?
Not funny! Not funny!
No!
So, did you save the world?
No. Tomorrow.
Oh, it's you.
Anything from Derrick?
Nope. Rodney called.
What'd he say?
Derrick is out, and he heard Lockhart/Gardner's breaking up.
You're serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.
Diane Lockhart's been lining up clients for a coup.
I'm going back to sleep now.
Making little kitten noises.
That's blood, Jon, on the floor of your car.
We're testing it now,
and my guess is, it's going to come back
as the blood of Mr. Lightbox, the murdered pharmacist.
Inadmissible, Cary, and you know it.
Fruit of the poisonous tree.
The only reason you searched the car
is because of an illegal search of our client's bag in their dorm room.
And yes, if this was strictly about court, that would be true.
But what you need to know
is that we're closing in on you two.
Then come back to us when you've closed in,
because this melodrama is getting old.
We'll find the gun, Alexis, then the deal goes away.
Right now, it's eight months.
Make it eight-month probation and we'll talk.
Then I'll just walk across the hall,
and I'll make the same offer to your girlfriend.
Then walk.
You wouldn't be here if they hadn't said the same thing.
Okay,
but it's your life your lawyers are gambling with, Jon.
And here's... here's one more thing you might consider:
My boss is Glenn Childs.
He's running for reelection.
And he's received a fairly large campaign contribution
from Keith Murphy, the father of your boyfriend.
Now, who do you think my boss
would rather make a deal with,
your or his campaign contributor?
So, if I were you, I would jump at that,
because how would that look to the electorate?
Glenn Childs making a light plea offer
to one of his largest campaign contributors?
Are you listening?
I'm listening.
You don't understand.
Alexis won't turn on me, and I won't turn on her.
Are you sure about that?
Because I just came from him,
and he has these high-priced lawyers,
and they seem to be wearing him down.
I don't believe you.
Do you think love can conquer all?
Even a 25-year stretch?
Well, that's good.
Jonathan's dad just flew in.
Maybe he can talk to him.
What's Kalinda doing?
She's looking for the gun.
I need you to keep something confidential, Alicia.
Okay.
Can you do that?
I... If you ask me to.
I've come to respect you mightily as a lawyer.
Thank you.
David Lee, Julius and I are starting our own firm.
We want you to come with us.
As you can imagine, this is very difficult.
I have genuine feelings for Will,
but he and Bond are taking the firm
in a direction that leaves little room for me-- a woman.
Does Will know about this?
That we're leaving? No.
And I know you two have a close relationship.
That's why I'm asking you-- whichever way you choose to go,
you must keep this conversation confidential.
He's having his third instincts.
And here we come.
Alexis has a friend.
Jenni, uh, Salerno.
Someone from the neighborhood.
She phoned. She was in trouble.
She needed to be picked up, so... so we drove her.
She had blood on her shirt and her shoes,
and she had a gun.
Did you touch the gun?
Yes.
We hoped to get rid of it.
Okay, I need you to tell me exactly:
Where did you get rid of it?
Hey, Blake, we need you to locate a Jenni Salerno.
Yeah.
With any luck, he tossed it in the water.
I don't think he's been having much luck up until now.
Where's you car?
Come on in.
Yep, they're doing a quadrant search.
He said it was right up over here.
So what do we do?
It's illegal to take it.
So we just leave it?
Hope maybe the police don't find it?
It's not technically part of the crime scene.
The police haven't found any evidence yet.
And who's to say this gun was the gun?
We took it into our possession.
We were in a crime-ridden neighborhood.
We were worried someone would find the gun
before the police were contacted.
It's evidence.
We can't destroy, move, alter, conceal evidence.
So that's it, then.
Yes.
Pull over here.
Why?
A thought.
We're not selling.
No, we, uh...
back by the rocks over there,
we just found a gun.
We didn't know if it was one of yours. Maybe not.
Okay.
Was that legal?
That was on the line.
She said that? She lying.
They also said that you wanted them to get rid of your gun
and that you sold them some prescription pills.
What?
It was the opposite. I bought some of those pills from them.
Answer the question!
Thursday night, 11:00 P.M., where were you?
I was at a ATM machine, okay?!
Geez! I was getting out money!
Empty your pockets.
Surveillance photos of Jenni at 11:10 P.M.
There's no way she would have gotten
from the murder scene to the ATM machine.
So Jonathan and Alexis,
they're lying.
They broke in, the two of them.
The pharmacist surprised them.
Alexis saw him raising his gun to shoot Jonathan,
so she struggled with him and killed him.
Later, they told Jenni what happened.
Alexis killed him to save Jonathan.
So we need him to take the plea.
We need him to turn on her.
How are we going to do that?
The one reason he hasn't turned on her yet: love.
You're going to break them up?
No one said it would be pretty.
I have a question in my mind, they started pushing her hard...
He's here.
Mr. Murphy.
Where's my son?
He's being questioned. I'm Will Gardner.
We spoke on the phone.
All right, Diane, what's going on?
The state's attorney made an offer:
four months in trade for his testimony.
Against her?
Yes. It looks like they burglarized the pharmacy together,
but she was the one who shot the pharmacist.
Um, maybe we should...
How long has Jonathan been dating Alexis?
Dating? Half a year, maybe. Why?
The reason Jonathan has refused
to take a plea is his concern for her.
We need him to rethink that concern.
What was your name again?
Will Gardner.
Do you have a plan for doing that?
Yes, but it would help if we had some ammunition.
He e-mails regularly with my wife.
About a month ago, he told her he couldn't sleep.
He was... he...
he thought Alexis was seeing another student.
Did he give you a name?
He overheard her talking to someone on the phone
named Neil.
That's all I know.
That's enough. I'll get on it.
You think this is a mistake?
I can't tell what's a mistake anymore.
He didn't do it.
Yes, but she did it to save him.
Damn. It's the kid with the gun.
Hey, that's kind of fortuitous, huh?
This kid just showed up with the murder weapon.
Really?
Yeah.
Turns out he's a sophomore at CSC
and he just found the gun,
called it in to the police.
That's a real Good Samaritan.
It's a good thing he pointed us towards the gun
because we never would have found it.
Yeah, it's a good thing. Yeah.
Not only that, but we found prints on it.
The lab is expediting them, so we should know
in a couple hours who those prints belong to.
So, it's a good time to make that deal with us.
Yeah, we'll get back to you.
Do you really think he's going to hold out much longer?
He's negotiating with us right now to get the plea down.
I don't believe you.
I love him, and he loves me.
Well, I hope you're right,
because I just found the murder weapon.
And my guess is,
it has both your prints on it.
Let me talk to her.
I know the lawyers over there, Alexis.
I know how they work.
They're doing what I'm going to do right now:
plead with you to take this deal.
I know you think love lasts forever.
It doesn't.
Love wilts in the face of 25 years,
and then it'll just be you and a prison cell.
Listen to me, please.
Here's your Neil-- Neil Osiola.
She phoned him three times in one night,
five times the following week.
Good. Great.
No, it's not what you think.
She's not cheating on him.
Doesn't matter. We can leverage this.
No, I phoned him. He's her OB/GYN.
And she's phoning her OB/GYN 'cause she's pregnant.
Look, she phoned him seven times--
three in one night.
Neil Osiola.
Neil Osiola there.
You see?
That's the woman you're throwing away your future for.
That's the man she's been cheating with.
Sorry I have to be tough.
People decide their future in a heartbeat,
and they don't know how important that heartbeat is.
Wilk's doing the same thing in his room.
I understand.
I just don't have to like it,
but I understand.
Do it, Jon.
It's not right, Dad.
No, what's not right is having your mom
visit you in prison for the next 25 years.
What's not right is throwing away your future.
I can't turn on her.
You can, son.
She did it.
She killed a man.
She killed a man to save me.
The only reason we were there was because of me.
And you won't walk away from that.
You'll be sentenced for burglary.
You'll have a record.
Dad, I love her.
Do you love me?
Then, please...
do this.
Get him in here.
Cary. Cary.
Have you made a decision?
I want to confess.
No!
No!
Alexis!
Alexis, it's okay!
No!
Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
Hold on.
Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out, please!
Please. Why?
Why did you do it?
We're having a baby.
I can't have you inside.
No!
Look, you did this to protect me.
That's why I'm doing this.
No.
No.
No!
No! No!
I understand.
Now I do.
Thank you.
That was Murphy?
Yes.
He wants another firm to handle his son's appeal.
He wants to take his business elsewhere.
And he's going with you?
With me?
To your new firm.
You want to have this out now?
We're both here.
Who told you? Alicia?
No. She didn't tell me.
In fact, I didn't even know she already knew.
I've asked her to join me.
And she's considering it?
I think so.
Who else?
Why, so you can weed out the betrayers?
You should have told me, Diane.
If I was considering this,
I would have told you.
Are you serious?
You and Bond have been plotting for months...
Oh, my God, you're paranoid.
And I'm right.
Tell me I'm not right.
No,
you know what? I'm through telling you.
We have not made one single move against you, Diane.
Not one.
You said you never knew Blake.
Kalinda found out--
you and Blake go back for years.
And you and Bond have been systematically
turning the equity partners against me.
You are only happy when you think
people are lined up against you.
So have it.
Happy birthday.
It's my present to you.
Gorge on your own paranoia, but don't come in tomorrow.
This is my firm, as well.
No, it isn't!
And tomorrow,
I'm going to have guards outside your office doors,
and I'm gathering the equity partners.
To vote me out.
Tell me my concerns weren't real.
You made your concerns real.
I'm in here.
You're up late.
Yeah.
I'm eating Halloween candy.
Do you want some?
No. I'm good.
I'm never going to find love.
What do you mean?
I'm hard to live with.
I get sick of people.
They get on my nerves.
You called Kevin.
I did.
I apologized.
I was very convincing.
I even... convinced myself.
But he said it's over.
Oh, Owen.
It's all right.
Scary thing is that I felt relieved.
I don't know.
Love just doesn't seem to last very long for me.
They should put you in a museum.
Thanks.
No. It's not, um...
No, it's just this ability you have.
How... how do you make love outlast passion?
Is that what I do?
I don't know. You tell me.
I think it's not just about the heart, Owen.
I think, sometimes, the heart needs... steering.
I thought you were going to say something profound.
What was wrong with that?
"The heart needs... steering."
It's late.
I'm going to stay here for a couple of days.
Okay.
I mean, you can say no.
Can I?
No.
Okay.
So, Owen, why don't you stay here for a few days?
If you insist.
Will you make cooing sounds
