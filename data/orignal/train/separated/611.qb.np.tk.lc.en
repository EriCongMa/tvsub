from the marble steps of old dc to the sun soaked tampa coast .
i have been to every place where you can find a human race
but i have been vicki the mooooooost !
i &apos;m gonna go get a shovel , because theater is dead .
hi starburns .
todd , you know you don &apos;t have to creep around to be weird , right ?
you &apos;re weird at picnics .
did you hear about the paintball game ?
yeah , i heard there was no paintball .
i heard it was banned .
well , you can &apos;t believe everything you hear .
okay , you just asked if i heard something
and now you &apos;re invalidating the whole .
* rainbows , pillows , cupcakes , angels , *
* london , horses , mittens , cocoa , *
* vicki , dear sweet vicki , *
* i won &apos;t be home tonight ... *
* vicki , you deserve more than this , more than this , *
* i &apos;ll give you diamonds and starlight , *
* starlight , but i &apos;m dead *
do you know why i beat you , todd ?
seriously , you don &apos;t ?
cuz i don &apos;t either , but that was insane .
i &apos;m 50 , here .
i think , i think i could win this year .
i think i can go all the way .
actually , you &apos;ll be settling for silver .
第六季 第十一集
names , you give me names or you &apos;re expelled , that simple .
i told ya , i don &apos;t know nothing about no secret paintball games .
this is from huffing paint , i swear .
escort alex osbourne off campus .
hey , hey , hey !
hold your horse panties .
you didn &apos;t tell me you knew my name .
look , i was about to take todd out , and then we both got shot .
guy was invisible .
a ghost .
uses silver paint .
a ghost ?
so no name ?
i &apos;d call him silver ghost ,
but that &apos;s probably already taken
by an indie comic book or a terrible tequila .
bye forever starburns .
no . no . no , no , no , no . no , don &apos;t make me .
frankie ?
dean , i respect that you are my boss , so either fire me or
let me handle this and go to your office .
i want to give your paintball friends a message , jeff .
good morning .
this era is over .
it was fun while it lasted , but now mommy &apos;s home .
everybody with a gun will be expelled or fired .
don &apos;t worry , miss dart .
my boys and i will get this cleaned up in no time .
thank you .
jeff , do you know deputy custodian lapari .
oh , we haven &apos;t had the pleasure because
mr.winger has caused me nothing
but pain over the years with his paint balling .
i &apos;m sorry . i quit that .
that &apos;s behind me .
sure it is .
handling turds has rubbed off on him .
custodian lapari is gonna be honored this week
at the gala for a cleaner greendale .
i &apos;d like you to introduce him .
why would i do that ?
because you &apos;re the de facto leader of greendale .
and if you gave a speech coming out against paintball ,
it might end it .
no . no . just because i &apos;m not playing
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m the weenie that tells people not to .
please ?
if not for greendale , then for me ?
i &apos;ll think about it .
look , i was a different guy back then .
yeah . two , never mind .
well , frankie &apos;s upset .
did she break up with someone ?
which gender ?
i don &apos;t care , but everybody else does .
she &apos;s upset about paintball .
paint ?
ball ?
occasionally our campus erupts into a flawless , post modern ,
homage to action adventure mythology ,
mischaracterized by the ignorant as parody .
apparently , now that frankie &apos;s declared it illegal ,
it &apos;s gone underground ,
and is still happening as we speak .
well maybe for freshman ,
but honestly we &apos;ve kind of done it to death , right ?
done it ?
nailed it ? i &apos;ve won a few time now .
no , who keeps track of that ? lame !
i &apos;m thinking mostly about frankie .
she &apos;s our friend ,
and she cares about this school , and i think it would
break her heart if she caught any of us undermining her goals .
yeah . yeah .
i agree . a reasonable agreement .
you &apos;re both right .
well , meeting adjourned , i guess .
this is good .
i &apos;m glad we all agree not to do this .
is gonna make it a lot easier for me to beat you .
what the hell ?
they killed meeeeeee !
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
do something stupid .
i thought we weren &apos;t playing .
is this an alliance ?
i don &apos;t know , is it ?
who &apos;s people ?
cut the crap , elroy .
stop that , what are you doing ?
go back to class .
winger &apos;s playing paintball .
no , he &apos;s not .
don &apos;t think about it , don &apos;t think about it .
don &apos;t do it .
grow up .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not playing .
for a guy who &apos;s not playing ,
you sure are shooting a bunch of mothers .
that was instinct .
i can &apos;t help being a bad ass .
but i am not playing .
okay , so let &apos;s make this painless .
take it easy .
leave her alone .
stop it .
knock it off .
frankie is coming .
what is important to you people ?
jeff winger shot me .
do i use echo location to navigate ?
why would you ask that after learning you aren &apos;t a bat ?
hello .
hi , frankie .
frankie .
jeff , student just passed by me
and said you shot him with paint .
okay .
so , you are definitely not playing paint ball ?
no .
frankie , i &apos;ve been cool up until now , but i gotta tell you ,
i &apos;m starting to get offended by your suspicion about this .
well .
well is a hole in the ground when you &apos;re thirsty .
oh . i &apos;m telling you , i ain &apos;t playing no paintball .
okay , take it easy guys .
and for what it &apos;s worth , thank you for teaching me the cool ,
new way to respond to people saying the word well .
all right guys .
bye franks take it easy .
would you stop doing that ?
don &apos;t hate the player .
colloquialisms aside , annie &apos;s right .
the thing to hate this year is the game .
can i show you all something ?
you know this game is being run anonymously through
an online server , but who set it up ?
they haven &apos;t left a clue which is a really big clue
because if they &apos;re this good at anything .
why are they here ?
whoever &apos;s running this server
is offering a huge cash prize to the winner .
more evidence they don &apos;t go here .
and they seem to have their own man in the game .
you &apos;ve probably heard about a mysterious player
using silver paint balls .
well , look at these ip addresses .
if that means what i think it means ,
we &apos;re dealing with gibberish .
those are mine .
that &apos;s a student or teacher on this campus
opening an encrypted tunnel to an off campus site .
big deal . i do that all the time .
oh , i save it all up for saturday night .
you &apos;re right , it &apos;s no big deal .
unless you always do it immediately before a paintball player
is taken out with premium grade silver paintballs
by an unknown shooter .
and unless the ip that you &apos;re connecting to , is this one .
aah , of course .
so who &apos;s the silver paintballs guy ?
spy , assassin , mercenary ,
bad person walking among us
laughing , laughing quietly .
and then if we look ,
pretending that he was looking at something funny .
i suppose you all should be in trouble .
but desperate deans ,
but desperates ...
but des ,
but desperate deans call for deansperate measures .
from here on out , you work for me .
everything you &apos;re saying just proves my point ,
that the only way to lose this game is to play it .
and i say we do the honest thing , and tell frankie .
the school &apos;s playing and losing already , frankie included .
if the people in this room play to win ,
we can not only take city college &apos;s money ,
we can expose silverballs , and ,
in turn , city college , and save greendale .
which is basically saving frankie .
all right , so we lay low ,
and we try to find out who silverballs is .
but we &apos;re not , to be clear , we did not vote on that name .
here &apos;s a name you don &apos;t have to vote on .
you just became the secret dean force , the dean boys ,
task force dean , his dean , secret people .
i know the word dean is in it .
because when the politicians fail ,
and the peace talks fall apart .
when it seems like all is lost ,
and nobody really needs the dean anymore because frankie &apos;s here .
that &apos;s when you go in .
the last bastion of a bygone era when people respected me .
dean force one .
if you &apos;re gonna hang around , we could use some water .
on it .
club club , the last club i thought i &apos;d ever join .
your target is a small time paintball munitions dealer .
all we know is he &apos;s a white male over 30
and his street name is fun dad .
all right is everybody in this club ready
to party the way they do in clubs ?
connor stop horsing around with billy and party .
dj might be the guy from meowmeowbeenz .
we need clean intelligence , abed .
no references , no call backs .
excuse me good sir , if i could have the mic .
attention shoppers there &apos;s a sale on partying in
in my pants aisle .
everything in my pants must go .
well not everything , that doesn &apos;t , you know what i.
koogler ?
aladdin .
i thought your name was fun dad .
no .
that was easy .
i need ammunition .
are you a narc ?
why would i answer that honestly ?
good point . it &apos;s how most people answer , so .
yeah , come on , it &apos;s a bad question .
you just get so many narcs .
hey don &apos;t forget .
there &apos;s a sign up sheet on the back wall for club club club .
listen , i &apos;m so glad omar that you &apos;re interested in paintball .
now i have to tell you , no shooting in here .
the first rule of club club is that we are not a fight club .
the second rule is that if you &apos;re a hot lady ,
you have to have sex with me .
and then there &apos;s a bunch of rules and restriction
that they &apos;ve just now been adding
because of the lawsuits based on that , second rule ,
which , i &apos;m not allowed to call a rule .
that was my screw up .
let me show you what i &apos;ve got here .
all right , these are blue travelers .
i think i &apos;ve got some sarcastic mellow yellows in here .
those are great . and these are green meanies .
they explode on contact , and they mark your target with paint .
that &apos;s a description of every paint ball .
okay , so you know your stuff .
why don &apos;t i give you a pro discount ?
i &apos;m thinking something more exotic , something in silver ?
yeah , okay , great .
i think that &apos;s a great idea , you know ?
you want to stay in the game ?
talk .
okay , look .
if you &apos;re a narc , you can &apos;t play .
and if you &apos;re playing , i do accept sex for ammo .
or beer , right ?
but not bitcoin . i mean , i believe in it .
i just , i think i feel like i need it to stabilize .
who is silver man ?
my accountant ?
oh , how do you know david ?
you know what i mean .
who buys the silver ammo ?
oh , look , if i tell you that , i &apos;m pretendsies dead .
koogler ?
they got him .
that &apos;s good .
then he wont be needing this .
koogler &apos;s thumb drive is actually a hardware encryption key .
hm , can it be unencrypted ?
no , you use it to decrypt something encrypted .
a key with a lock on it .
i &apos;ll give our enemy this .
they &apos;re clever .
why did they pair us together ?
look , a message chain between koogler and silverballs .
now he &apos;s ordering a huge batch of ammo ,
and stressing that he needs it before the cleaner greendale gala .
city college is ...
city college is going to crash frankie &apos;s gala .
and here &apos;s where silverballs decides on silver balls .
which color will look coolest against a navy blue jumpsuit ?
who wears a jumpsuit to a black tie gala ?
the guest of honor .
is your internet not working ?
it &apos;s one photo . it &apos;s taking an hour .
you have keystrokes programmed to , eesh , that &apos;s dorky .
looks like we &apos;ll be renting formal wear .
i &apos;ll measure jeffrey .
mister winger , you clean up nice .
oh , come on . i &apos;m always good looking .
this seems ambitious .
well , the monorail is more symbolic of
our potential than it is potential ,
and none of our buildings will ever be shaped like this .
but with a little work , this is how we could feel .
you should be proud .
thank you , jeff , for supporting this .
why is that in your ear ?
oh , i &apos;m raising awareness of armenian american stereotypes .
bale to belfry . let &apos;s check in .
should stereotypes have their awareness raised ? i ...
oh , good lord .
i &apos;m questioning you again . why ?
follow your bliss , sir . you &apos;ve earned it .
keaton to belfry , i need to just all make sure
we are very , very careful here .
bale to keaton , why don &apos;t you set a good example
by keeping your mind on the mission ?
and your eyes on the prize .
prize is secure .
keaton out .
west to belfry .
entrances secure .
keaton to kilmer , status .
kilmer to belfry , i &apos;m currently examining a spoon ,
only i &apos;m not really examining it .
i &apos;m using it as a cover
while watching a somewhat suspicious waiter .
voice of diedrich bader to belfry .
i &apos;ve checked the custodial wing for the third time .
can i come join the mission now ?
negative voice of diedrich bader .
continue to check the custodial wing ,
and then check the parameter of the inside of your office .
okay .
and for the record , i feel very vulnerable without a gun .
ugh , i know that someone plays in this thing .
该曲经常被废柴引用或提及
hey there , dean .
we need a custodian .
dean .
dean .
dean .
dean .
clooney to belfry i &apos;ve got a bogey with a gun .
excuse me .
i wasn &apos;t talking to you , i was ordering dinner .
yes hello can i get a bogey with a gun
no pickles and three orders of gun .
damn it .
clooney slooped the bogey , now he &apos;s headed for the kitchen .
should we go ?
negative , we don &apos;t know it &apos;s our man .
kilmer , clooney do nothing
unless you can do it quietly and calmly .
what the hell ?
no . nothing .
are you ready ?
yes .
clooney to kilmer .
what ?
should i come in now ?
no , no you can &apos;t ever come in , ever , you &apos;re sloppy .
excuse me , can i have a word with you ?
about what ?
well , there &apos;s been some reports about a paintball game on campus .
oh yeah , you better believe the kitchen boys are playing and
this year we got a new winning strategy .
let the idiots come to you .
oh really ,
oh britta you can come in now .
i &apos;m sorry !
i stand before you one of greendale &apos;s
biggest perpetrators of paint related mayhem
and i am happy to say
that those days are fully behind our school .
looking back on those dark days ,
it &apos;s clear that the only heroes
were the janitors and the custodians left to clean up our messes .
so it is with great shame and poetic irony
that i present the custodial innovation award
to vice custodian , lapari .
what the hell are you doing in there ?
jeff , focus .
you all right , man ?
yes .
it wasn &apos;t our guy .
the assassin is not in the kitchen .
he &apos;s still at large .
and now let &apos;s all enact
what i hope will become a yearly tradition ,
the popping of the balloons .
what ?
stay calm , check your zones .
who &apos;s that ?
where ?
where ?
i don &apos;t see anything .
him .
sorry .
it &apos;s the custodians .
greendale &apos;s custodial staff
is running the underground paintball tournament
probably with city college money .
the people that clean greendale
don &apos;t want a cleaner greendale ,
they want greendale to be afraid of itself
and reliant on them .
oh , what an exciting story .
we &apos;re got a real life m night shamalyan here .
it &apos;s shyamalan .
unfortunately , as with his stories
i don &apos;t anticipate yours holding up .
easy target .
who &apos;s heckling me ?
oh , of course , it &apos;s the indian guy .
i &apos;m arabic .
okay , let &apos;s go with that .
anyway , you know what goes great with crazy stories ?
evidence .
you &apos;re the evidence .
come back to our side and tell the truth ,
so city college can be exposed .
or i could leave and get a job at city college ,
where their pay phones aren &apos;t only herpe @-@ free ,
they &apos;re actually removed .
you think city college will take you
if you lose their paintball prize money ?
i don &apos;t know how many men you have left in your game ,
but if you &apos;re leaving this room , it needs to be a small army .
okay . i agree .
annie look out .
an eye for an eye .
no !
no !
dammit !
we &apos;re the last ones left ?
cover me .
oh , dreams do come true !
okay , we got him . he went into a supply closet .
i know . i guess to a custodian ,
a supply closet is like a location .
i &apos;m actually relieved .
i thought this was gonna be a whole gauntlet .
my heart was not in it .
i mean , i shot a disabled kid .
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
what are you looking at ?
this isn &apos;t a closet .
oh , it &apos;s really nice of you guys to visit ,
not that you ever would have done it intentionally .
your steamy pipes can &apos;t stop us .
well , it would be a pretty bad museum exhibit if it could .
give it up , lapari .
hey dean , i have a microphone .
you have a beer .
god has a plan .
i have a beer ?
it &apos;s an old stand up line for using up hecklers .
keep moving .
did you do stand up ?
is that how you became a custodian ?
listen man , i was there in the 90s .
i did a few open mic nights .
i saw what karaoke did .
it wasn &apos;t cool man .
we &apos;re not so different , you and i , dean .
don &apos;t you see we &apos;re both in the same situation ?
oh , you gotta be kidding me .
screw it . shoot them all .
one of them is him . shoot every single one .
he &apos;s not back here .
okay .
reload .
must be a mop jousting bridge over sawdust canyon .
we &apos;re both dinosaurs roaring in vain at the mammals .
what do you think was gonna happen
when you let frankie dart into our world ?
how much more clean can she make the school
before she notices the dirtiest thing of all about it .
you think i &apos;m a villain , but i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m defending a place where we all get to be our own heroes .
we &apos;re all here because none of us can have nice things .
i thought you guys were mannequins !
what a backfire !
is the money real ?
no mater who wins ?
dean , what are you doing ?
what are you thinking about ?
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s right , jeffrey .
a cleaner greendale is like a healthier cigarette .
yes , a carrot stick .
frankie can make us a carrot stick .
we &apos;re tobacco .
no , we are not tobacco .
we are robert downey jr ,
he was so high he was crawling into people &apos;s windows .
now he &apos;s iron man .
we self destruct like this because we &apos;d rather be heroes
than villains than just kind of sucky people ,
that need to work a lot at getting less sucky .
she will forgive us .
i know her , i like her ,
and if she fires either of you , i &apos;ll quit .
she &apos;s not the enemy , she can help us .
we just have to cool it .
it &apos;s true , what he said .
if you guys lower your guns ,
i &apos;m not gonna throw you a party ,
but i &apos;m not going to get anyone fired either .
i &apos;ll see you monday , idiots .
so who wins ?
what do we ...
okay ,
on the count of three we &apos;re gonna shoot ourselves in the foot .
one , two .
i &apos;ll see you guys on monday .
and the pope looks at the giraffe and says i &apos;m in the room .
sorry i can &apos;t remember the whole joke .
that &apos;s okay it sounds very funny based on the last line .
frankie &apos;s gonna be here soon we should get ready .
we &apos;re not seriously still doing this are we ?
we promised everyday for a week do we want her to quit ?
good morning everyone .
so , where did we leave off last time ?
yes , sir .
i like big trucks .
i saw a fire truck today .
interesting point .
would anyone care to comment ?
elroy ?
i made a stinky .
worth considering . next item ?
how do you pronounce pasketti ?
spaghetti . what else ?
can we go to the zoo ?
well , that raises a very important point .
we can do anything we want if ,
and this is very important , if we grow up .
all in favor ?
then she starts singing about all the places she &apos;s been .
which , by the way , seems to be a total of two .
one of which is old dc .
old dc .
okay fine , vicki , you &apos;re a music major , not a history major .
and the whole mother thing ,
i mean the two big feathers in her cap are that
she hasn &apos;t let anything change her ,
a triumph she shared with most animals , and all dirt ,
and the fact that her mother died ,
which is like one thing all mother &apos;s do .
i mean , was she a good mother ?
did she collect stamps ? did she race cars ?
we don &apos;t know !
we don &apos;t know her name ,
i think if you ask vicki the color of her mother &apos;s eyes ,
she would say dead .
or , maybe she would say $ 7 a seat .
it &apos;s bad man , i am telling you .
nobody is safe , nobody is safe .
blue .
they were a very pale shade of blue .
i &apos;m sorry my show didn &apos;t honor her memory properly .
i &apos;ll try to make it up to you .
actually we both will a , a ,
at the premier of our new show .
vicki and garrett .
let &apos;s have a hand for vicki &apos;s mother everybody .
stand up connie .
vicki &apos;s mother , vicki &apos;s mother !
boo !
we &apos;d rather you boo .
it means you felt something .
that &apos;s right . you can boo .
and , andy kaufman loved booing .
then again , we did put a fair share of work into this .
like , you don &apos;t have to be dicks .
did you get any of that ?
