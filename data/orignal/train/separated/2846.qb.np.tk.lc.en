when you make out the card , be sure to make it out to &quot; emily . &quot;
it &apos;s good that you had such a good time in greece .
what ?
i didn &apos;t have a good time in greece !
ross abandoned me !
i couldn &apos;t get a plane out . i had to stay in their suite !
people came up to me going ,
&quot; mrs. geller ! why are you cry ? &quot;
i mean , it was so humiliating ! i felt like such an idiot !
it &apos;s all my fault .
you know why ? because i make very bad decisions .
oh , that &apos;s not true .
yes , it is true . i went after ross in stupid london !
london is stupid ! stupid !
i put on a cheerleading outfit to seduce joshua .
then i lost him because i asked him to marry me after four dates .
and then i went to greece on somebody else &apos;s honeymoon . okay ?
do those sound like very good decisions to you ?
i like your little braid .
i just shouldn &apos;t be allowed to make decisions anymore .
phoebe , you were right . i should &apos;ve never gone to london .
from now on , you make all my decisions for me .
oh , no . i did that for someone once .
i &apos;m not comfortable having that power over someone &apos;s life .
i &apos;ll do it .
fine . monica , you are now in charge of my love life .
okay . i got to go to work .
and rachel , great to have you back .
phoebe

ross is married . i still can &apos;t believe it .
honey , sweetie , by the edges .
i &apos;ll just have to accept it .
i mean , it &apos;s my fault .
edges ! fingers ! smudgy !
oh , my god !
that &apos;s okay .
i know that you &apos;re very upset right now.i know that wasn &apos;t about me .
i bet it was about her a little .
if you &apos;d stop thinking about ross ... you &apos;d notice there are great guys everywhere .
look . gunther .
he &apos;s nice . he &apos;s cute .
yeah . i guess gunther is ....
what about that guy over there ?
that &apos;s the guy you flirted with at the counter .
oh , i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re going to talk to him .
i make your decisions , and i say you &apos;re going to talk to him .
all right.you &apos;re the boss .
i got to do what you tell me .
say that to him , and you &apos;re golden .

all i get to do now is pregnant stuff . it bums me out .
i &apos;m sorry . -sorry .

it sounds a little corny ... but sometimes when i &apos;m bummed out ,
i like to just close my eyes ... and think about what a wonderful gift life is .

i got myself a date tomorrow .

you did not drop any socks !
i saw dave , and he said you blew him off !
you listen to me ! i &apos;m calling the shots !
i say you leave ross and go get dave .
what are you doing ?
well , ultimately i was trying , you know , i wanted ...
... to tell him that i &apos;m still in love with him .
what ? you cannot tell him that !
why ? why not ? people love to hear that !
come on , i love you .
wasn &apos;t that nice ? -no .
i make the decisions and i say no !
you know what ? no , you don &apos;t make my decisions , because ... you &apos;re fired .
you can &apos;t fire me .
i make your decisions , and i say i &apos;m not fired ! ha !
well ....
come on , let me in !

rachel locked the door .
i &apos;ll kick that door in if you give me some sugar .
ross , there &apos;s something i wanna talk to you about.i just need to
rachel , open this door !

no
we really need to talk .
well , then talk.okay , i will .
remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do ?
yes
what thing ?
rachel wants to take swing dance lessons .
which i think is a really stupid idea .
it &apos;s dangerous .
she won &apos;t get what she wants.and who knows who she might end up hurting ?
monica &apos;s right . swing dancing can be tricky .
i have to use the phone.i gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears i sent to emily .
my god ! think of the massacre .
i &apos;m going to do it .
i know you think i &apos;m crazy .
but before you tell him , try to find one person ... who thinks it &apos;s a good idea .
i bet you can &apos;t .
but i ... please ?
all right . fine .
joey ! i &apos;m in !
all right . good deal .
hi . -hey , rach .
did you find anyone who agrees with you ?
no.but you know what ? i think i need a male point of view .
joey .
you &apos;re a man .
you got that right .
do you think it would be a good idea if i told ross that i was still in love with him ?
nope .
phoebe ! -hey , phoebe .
phoebe ?
yeah .
you know how you were saying you didn &apos;t get to go to london ... and you were feeling left out ?
ya
well , we all felt really bad about that ...
... so we decided to take a little trip together !
oh , that &apos;s so nice !
how great ! where &apos;s the trip ?
well , we thought we would all go to a picnic ...
... in central park !
central park ?
all of us . all day .
that sucks !
that &apos;s not a trip ! i just came from there .
what &apos;ll we high @-@ five about at the stupid park ?
it &apos;s right by my house . all right !
i &apos;m going home to bask in the triumph of my central park idea .
hold on a sec there , mr. kissy .
i wanted to talk to you about ... this whole new european thing you &apos;ve got going on .
and i need to say it makes me very uncomfortable ... and i just , you know , just stop it !
just bringing some culture to the group .
that &apos;s fine . just don &apos;t bring it in my mouth .
it makes me want to puke .
hey , everybody ! phoebe is here !
phoebe ! woo ! -okay . woo ! hi !

let &apos;s go .
you know what ? i &apos;ll meet you in a minute .
rachel , you didn &apos;t find anyone , so you can &apos;t tell him .
you know what ? that doesn &apos;t matter .

i don &apos;t care .
i can &apos;t watch .
what you reading ?
paper.yeah ? what &apos;s it about ?
events from around the globe .
okey

go ahead .
i think i &apos;m just going to say it.i &apos;m just going to say it .

why are you laughing ?
because i just heard it !
i heard it . and it &apos;s ridiculous !
i mean .... you &apos;re married !
you &apos;re married , and it &apos;s just ridiculous !
when i said it , i sort of floated up out of my body .
and then i heard myself say it , and then the floating rachel ....
i was like , &quot; you are such an idiot ! &quot;
well , i am married . -i know .
though i haven &apos;t spoken to her since the wedding .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s not funny .
actually , it kind of is .
my wife won &apos;t return my calls .
i don &apos;t know where my wife is .
&quot; hey , ross ! where &apos;s the missus ? &quot; &quot; don &apos;t know ! &quot;
