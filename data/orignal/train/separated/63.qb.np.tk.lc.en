alicia florrick and will gardner , please .
12 counts of murder .
12 ? 12 murders ?
yes .
i ...
what did your client do , shoot up the base ?
sergeant elkins works in the uas division .
uas ?
unmanned aerial systems .
drones .
sergeant elkins is charged with disobeying orders
and firing two hellfire missiles on 12 unarmed citizens
in waziristan , afghanistan .
and you &apos;re defending him ?
her . yes .
so , why do you need us ?
we &apos;re still not very qualified to assist in military court .
you did it once before .
yes , but not very well .
well , that is debatable .
due to the seriousness of the charge ,
sergeant elkins is insisting on civilian support ,
and i thought you would do the least damage .
sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean it that way .
i am so sorry , captain , we would love to help .
she has money from her family .
would you excuse me ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
yeah ? what are you finding out ?
you &apos;re being investigated .
thanks , kalinda .
anything else ?
state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office wants to use you
to get to lemond bishop .
i know . if we drop him as a client ,
will they back off ?
look , don &apos;t ...
kalinda , come on .
don &apos;t worry , they &apos;re backing off anyway .
peter &apos;s no longer in charge of the investigation .
he ... what ?
yeah , he &apos;s worried about conflict of interest .
his wife working under you .
he really backed out ?
yeah .
i hear someone confronted him about this conflict of interest .
so , who is in charge ?
my guess is cary .
so that &apos;s your source on this ? cary ?
no , someone close to him .
someone else on the investigation .
so , you think i can exhale ?
i think you dodged a bullet .
miss sharma ?
hello .
who was that ?
no idea .
where are you again ?
d.c.
oh , yes . cheese , our most important client .
tell eli not to screw this one up .
we lose cheese , we lose our quarter .
will do .
now , go exhale , do something nice for someone .
you know , captain ,
we might be able to work something out .
we thank the usda for their time
as they reconsider which food guide to recommend to congress .
our argument is simple .
go back to the pyramid .
the old food guide was simple , bold , understandable .
we have witnesses here today , schoolteachers , parents ,
who will testify that children could easily grasp its pictures .
that &apos;s the schoolteacher ?
yeah .
she looks like a bond girl .
she &apos;s a fifth grade schoolteacher .
i don &apos;t care , she doesn &apos;t look like a schoolteacher .
they won &apos;t listen unless she looks like one .
tell her to put a sweater on or something .
what ? hold on , hold on .
the new design ...
give me your glasses .
give me your glasses .
um , the @-@ the new design ,
myplate , is confusing .
give her this .
go on .
what are grains ?
what is protein ?
we would argue that this is the result of aggressive lobbying
by the produce council
as opposed to aggressive lobbying by the cheese council .
we don &apos;t deny that we are lobbying , undersecretary brattle ,
but we would deny that that &apos;s all that we &apos;re doing .
um , as you can hear from a miss vickie evans ,
a schoolteacher from nebraska ...
uh , she can talk
of the difficulties that she has with mypl ...
why don &apos;t we just say what this is really about ?
cheese . you &apos;ve lost $ 2 billion a year
because of the new , more accurate guide .
are you kidding ?
more accurate ?
you have dairy in a cup !
how is that accurate ?
it &apos;s not a cup ,
it &apos;s a smaller circle .
you drink milk in a cup ,
you don &apos;t drink cheese ...
there was no room
on the plate .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s a cartoon , it &apos;s not a real plate .
who &apos;s paying you off ? the produce council ?
okay , thank you , everyone .
we will discuss this in executive session ,
make our recommendations to congress .
what &apos;s going on with your boss ?
don &apos;t worry , secretary henshaw &apos;s still with you .
he has to affect neutrality .
he didn &apos;t expect the brush @-@ back from the undersecretary , that &apos;s all .
is he trying to shake us down ?
oh , yes , chicago .
i forgot .
the secretary doesn &apos;t &quot; shake down . &quot;
he &apos;s on your side .
this is going to congress next week .
the pyramid will be reinstated .
trust me .
that &apos;s the secretary &apos;s aide ?
yeah , why ?
well , how does she know me ?
she doesn &apos;t know you .
well , i &apos;m not that popular ...
oh , good , i was just making sure our gift arrived .
sergeant elkins receiving counsel .
ten @-@ hut !
at ease , sergeant .
yes , sir .
these are the two civilian lawyers i discussed .
will gardner , alicia florrick ,
from lockhart &amp; gardner .
hello , gina . do you want to sit ?
no , sir , thank you .
okay .
if you don &apos;t mind , we will .
so , these ...
murder counts ,
they are all based on your work
at the predator uas installation
in ...
nevada .
addis air force base , sir .
and you do what there ?
i am a uav operator .
i read and react to real @-@ time
on @-@ the @-@ ground alterations as detected by the uav sensors
and control the predator targeting systems .
the missiles ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
your commanding officer accuses you of inaccurate
and unprofessional reporting as to the presence
of 12 unarmed civilians , resulting in their deaths .
yes , sir , that is accurate .
it &apos;s accurate that that happened ?
uh , no , sir , it @-@ it &apos;s accurate as to the charge .
i see .
so ... what happened ?
i wish you would sit down .
i &apos;d rather not , sir .
there are occasional delays in the transmission of text alerts
and sensor relays ; i received the information too late , sir .
the transmission is logged as on time ,
because it indicates the time it was sent
but not the time it arrived .
is there someone who can corroborate that , gina ?
ma &apos;am , i @-@ i don &apos;t understand the question .
is there someone who saw the delay in the transmission ?
yes , ma &apos;am . as i already informed
captain hicks , my pilot saw it , too .
lieutenant ventura .
the pilot in the drone ?
no , ma &apos;am , on the ground .
we remotely operate the predator uav from nevada .
well , maybe we can interview him .
unfortunately , military justice moves very swiftly .
so we &apos;re struggling to catch up .
uh , are you ... ?
go ahead , sergeant , ask the question .
are @-@ are you taking my case , sir ?
do you want us to take your case ?
i do .
then yes .
she looks like she &apos;s 15 years old .
she &apos;s terrified .
one thing i don &apos;t understand ,
is why are they prosecuting this ?
i mean , there must be hundreds of civilian deaths
in similar drone mishaps .
why prosecute this one ?
i have no answer for that .
okay , let &apos;s get to this pilot , lieutenant ventura .
get me the dairy people on the phone , all of them .
where did you go ?
i need your help with the produce people .
heard they got a new lobbyist , and i heard he &apos;s as good as me .
she is .
who ?
secretary &apos;s aide , stacie hall .
she flipped sides .
no conference call , i &apos;ll call them later !
are you sure ?
yep , she played you , eli .
she left the usda to become a lobbyist for the produce people .
produce or fruit ?
fruit .
usda never intended to go back to the pyramid .
they were just trying to shake down the dairy guild .
oh , i &apos;ll be back .
having a hard time staying away from me ?
yep , you are just irresistible , kalinda .
so , what &apos;s up ?
i need a meeting with diane lockhart .
really ? why ?
our investigation into will gardner .
i thought you guys were winding down .
we are . just ... dotting a few i &apos;s .
all right . i &apos;ll see what i can do ,
and you &apos;ll tell me when the investigation heats up again .
oh , you will be my first call .
you want me out of your chair ?
no , stay comfortable .
who was that ?
kalinda .
really ?
yes .
how nice for you two .
oh , yes . she is quite the conversationalist .
she &apos;s definitely that .
we &apos;re gonna stay in touch .
got her on speed @-@ dial , have you ?
oh , thanks for reminding me .
kalinda is arranging a meeting with diane lockhart ,
and she asked me to call her
when the investigation heats up .
then give her a call .
getting a special prosecutor today .
you &apos;re kidding , who ?
me .
i &apos;m wendy scott @-@ carr .
hello .
hi .
peter assigned you ?
yes .
i think he thought that the person who ran against him--
and lost-- was a safe bet to be objective
with a case involving his wife .
of course , this case doesn &apos;t involve his wife .
actually , we don &apos;t know that yet .
let &apos;s see where the evidence takes us .
shall we get to work ?
this court @-@ martial is hereby convened under article 18
of the uniform code of military justice .
colonel leora kuhn , military judge presiding . all rise !
are there any other judges in the military ?
sit . except you .
mr. gardner , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , your honor .
what were you saying ?
what was i saying ?
yes . as i entered court , you saw fit
to say something to your cocounsel .
mrs. florrick .
judge kuhn .
what were you saying , mr. gardner ?
i would like to get it on the record .
apologies , your honor .
i was commenting ,
&quot; are there any other judges in the military ? &quot;
good . to answer your question ,
yes , there are .
and yet , here i am again .
happy days .
captain moyer , you have no objection
to the accused &apos;s civilian representation ?
we don &apos;t , your honor . we welcome it .
although it is a bit crowded at the defense table .
i imagine you can hold your own .
are there any motions before we call the panel ?
you take it ; she hates me .
was that also something you wanted to share , mr. gardner ?
yes , your honor .
i told mrs. florrick , &quot; you take it ; she hates me . &quot;
you wound me , sir .
what do you have for me , ma &apos;am ?
we ask the court &apos;s assistance
in transporting a witness for the defense .
a lieutenant matt ventura .
he was the pilot that was stationed
with our client at the uas ,
and he has firsthand knowledge of these events .
captain moyer , do you have any objection to this ?
we don &apos;t , your honor . in fact ,
we &apos;ve already transported him
as a witness for the prosecution .
well , that &apos;s awkward .
isn &apos;t it ?
what &apos;s most important is that
we run an ethical and clean investigation .
that &apos;s the best way to honor the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s directive .
now , i understand you have evidence of theft and bribery .
not evidence , suspicions .
more than suspicions--
the $ 45,000 will gardner stole .
that was 15 years ago ;
the statute of limitations has expired .
what about his connection to judge baxter ?
yes . i think we should start there .
no .
we don &apos;t need that to get to lemond bishop .
yes , well , that &apos;s what i most want to talk about .
i know the plan was to use mr. gardner
as a stepping stone to his drug @-@ dealing client ,
but i believe we should use mr. gardner
as a stepping stone ... to mr. gardner .
i understand you have a source in lockhart / gardner .
i do .
the investigator , kalinda sharma .
good . cultivate that .
hang on a minute .
wasn &apos;t the directive of this investigation to pursue drugs ,
mrs. scott @-@ carr ?
it was .
and we could be concerned about mission creep here .
but mr. florrick has given me
the autonomy to set objectives .
and in looking at the evidence ,
i believe the more profitable direction
is judicial corruption .
how does that sound ?
good to me .
me , too .
so , you saw the alert from the ground commander warning that
there were civilians in the vicinity .
yes , sir .
there are sometimes delays in the transmission of such alerts .
did you experience any delays here ?
no , there were no delays , sir .
then why did the accused ignore the warning ?
objection ,
it &apos;s not determined yet
that staff sergeant elkins ignored anything .
overruled .
i don &apos;t know why sergeant elkins ignored it , sir .
i was stunned when she fired on the target .
thank you , lieutenant .
and thank you for your service to this country .
your honor , we ask for a five @-@ minute recess .
denied .
don &apos;t impeach him .
use him to ask the question .
lieutenant , have there been other civilian deaths
due to drone maneuvers ?
other afghan deaths ?
yes .
there have .
how many ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
but there have been civilian deaths .
not intentional civilian deaths , accidental .
yes .
our drones are accurate , but we can &apos;t control everything
that happens on the ground in afghanistan .
in fact , aren &apos;t civilian casualties such a common occurrence
that they have been assigned the slang term &quot; squirters &quot; ?
no , ma &apos;am , that &apos;s incorrect .
oh , my apologies .
in the week before the arrest of staff sergeant elkins ,
weren &apos;t eight civilians killed in a drone attack
on the al @-@ qaeda operative , amad al dasari ?
i believe nine were killed .
excuse me , nine .
and how many drone operators were arrested in that attack ?
how many ?
yes .
none , to my knowledge .
and how many prosecutions and arrests
have resulted from any of these civilian deaths ?
none .
so i &apos;m trying to figure this out .
even though you &apos;re in a trailer
20 miles north of las vegas ,
you do consider yourself part of the battlefield in afghanistan ?
yes , of course .
and , like many of the men and the women
on this jury , you have been in battle ,
even though you don &apos;t have any war wounds to show for it ?
that &apos;s correct , ma &apos;am .
so , staff sergeant elkins was in battle , too , wasn &apos;t she ?
yes .
so this is a prosecution of a soldier
who accidentally killed a civilian on the battlefield , isn &apos;t it ?
objection .
sustained .
that &apos;s okay . i think the jury understands .
mrs. florrick !
yes , that &apos;s right .
keep it casual , don &apos;t see me
until ... hark !
there you are .
i was rushing over here , rehearsing my apology .
can i just say i am so sorry ?
oh , did you , uh , order me something ?
just a little cheese and fruit .
you are such a kick , eli .
well , i hope this means you forgive me .
it does .
i blame myself for not seeing it coming .
oh , come on , there was nothing to see .
i was just offered the fruit association job yesterday .
smile , eli , so i know you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m not gonna let you go .
you &apos;re too cute to let go .
no , you &apos;re the cute one .
did anyone ever tell you , you have a prerecorded voice ?
a what ? no , what is that ?
one of those credit card voices
that tells you your call will be answered
in the order received .
i got to borrow that one .
so , on the phone , you mentioned something
about us working together ?
yes .
the dairy guild and the fruit association are natural allies .
we have a mutual enemy .
vegetables ?
yes .
you lost real estate .
vegetables gained real estate at your expense .
that &apos;s what i keep telling the fruit growers .
well , what do you propose ?
combine our lobbying efforts .
i want to say yes , eli ,
but you can &apos;t keep going after the pyramid .
so what should we do ?
well , without acknowledging we &apos;re a &quot; we &quot; yet ,
you should create a new diagram .
and if we do ?
well , show it to me .
fruit and cheese are natural allies here , right ?
she said yes , eli ?
yes , but she &apos;s lying .
she said yes too quickly .
she &apos;s either already talking to the vegetable lobby ,
or she &apos;ll use our interest to up their interest .
you got all of this from &quot; yes &quot; ?
i need to talk to the bread people .
eli , our clients don &apos;t want to go there .
i &apos;ll talk to them ; it &apos;s the only way to beat this lady .
we are not trying to beat this lady , eli ;
we &apos;re just trying to do well by our client .
i got to go .
andrew r. galecki .
i work at langley as a military analyst .
and you were part of the sensor @-@ to @-@ shooter
decision chain on the drone maneuver ?
yes , the kill chain .
now , the defense has argued that there are many deaths
in uas maneuvers , and this is just one more .
is that true ?
there is , in fact collateral damage in drone maneuvers ,
but most of these deaths are taken into account
in the kill chain algorithm .
you &apos;ll have to explain that , sir .
we take into account the strategic value
of eliminating a target ,
the potential damage to civilians ,
and the proximity to mosques , schools , or hospitals .
this is all entered into a computer algorithm ,
which determines the worthiness of an attack .
so there are some deaths of civilians
that are deemed appropriate .
unfortunately , yes , sometimes the value of killing
an al @-@ qaeda target outweighs killing civilians .
that was the case
with the al @-@ qaeda operative , amad al dasari ?
the defense has argued that someone should have been arrested
in that attack because civilians were killed .
no , that attack was sanctioned .
we were willing to risk more deaths
because mr. al dasari was such a danger to the united states .
and the drone attack , initiated by the accused ?
that was not a sanctioned attack .
we sent out an immediate transmission
when we saw children in the area .
the accused took it upon herself to fire anyway .
how many women are on the jury ?
six .
we should argue she &apos;s being prosecuted
because she &apos;s a woman .
it &apos;s not true , and even if it were , it doesn &apos;t matter .
why isn &apos;t it true ?
the pilot isn &apos;t being prosecuted ,
none of her commanders , all men .
do we know that ?
check the transcripts .
i thought it was all male names .
it won &apos;t work .
the panel will consider it whining .
what defense would they consider not whining ?
what &apos;d you find ?
um , nothing .
would you excuse me for a moment ?
it &apos;s not gonna work .
what &apos;s not gonna work ?
seducing me .
i don &apos;t want to seduce you .
you don &apos;t ?
no .
too easy .
hey .
i mean , what &apos;s the point anyway ? i don &apos;t get it .
without a penis involved ?
that &apos;s like baseball without a bat .
well , you get it when you get it .
oh ... deep .
it &apos;s different .
a woman &apos;s lips , and when you get a woman excited ...
it &apos;s not like a man .
i hope not .
it &apos;s not aggressive .
it &apos;s slow .
suspenseful .
you want to hurt cary ?
no .
yeah , you do .
that &apos;s okay , he wants to hurt you , too .
really ? and how does he want to do that ?
through me .
how &apos;s he gonna do that through you ?
there &apos;s a special prosecutor .
wendy scott @-@ carr .
yep .
and we &apos;re not going after lemond bishop .
we are going after will gardner .
on what ?
bribery , banging judges .
did i say banging ?
you did .
i meant bribing .
i need to get a cab .
here &apos;s my money .
i got it .
no , no , no , i got it , i got it .
you all right ?
i said it would take more than just a few shots
to get me into bed .
then what ?
i asked her what it was like to make love to a woman .
you want to know what she said ?
when we get excited , you can feel it .
did she want to touch you ?
she wanted me like this .
thank you .
so what were you were looking for ?
just seeing if someone was looking through my files .
well , your history &apos;s right here ,
which should show you which files were opened .
how far back ?
saturday .
nope . nothing on saturday .
your webcam was on , but that &apos;s about it .
what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;d she do ?
nothing . i just want to create stronger boundaries .
i think your grandmother misses being involved in our lives ,
and ... i want to talk to her about that .
well , dad sends her to pick us up .
i know . and i &apos;ll talk to your dad ,
but i don &apos;t know if i can change that .
so you just want us to keep her out of the apartment ?
she went through your laptop , didn &apos;t she ?
what ?
grandma went through mom &apos;s laptop .
i don &apos;t know that . i don &apos;t know .
your dad and i are being very good with each other these days ,
and i just don &apos;t want jackie getting in the way of that .
what was she looking for ?
i don &apos;t even know that she was .
here . take these keys , and let me know
if there are any problems .
mom , what does she want ?
i think your grandmother ...
wants sole custody for your dad .
what ?
mom , we &apos;re not six .
i know . she wishes you were .
is she looking for things you did wrong ?
i don &apos;t know , okay ?
i just ... i want to be safe , that &apos;s all .
is there anything on there ?
no .
mom , are you all right ?
i am , i ...
i just have to get this figured out , that &apos;s all .
we have to watch grandma .
i know .
she &apos;s such a bitch .
your call is very important to us .
please stay on the line
and your call will be answered in the order ...
it &apos;s her . it &apos;s her voice .
bread , eli .
our interests are identical .
bread .
dairy . you have suffered
the most from the myplate design .
bread used to hold the prominent spot on the pyramid .
now it is classified as grains .
so what do we do ?
combine our lobbying interests .
it &apos;s not going to help .
it &apos;s all about vegetables these days .
what food holds the most sway over congress ?
what food receives $ 3.5 billion a year in food subsidies ?
corn ?
that &apos;s right .
corn has always been classified as a vegetable ,
but it &apos;s just as much a grain .
how are you , gina ?
i &apos;m good , ma &apos;am .
are you in touch with your parents ?
i am .
are they coming ?
no .
is there anything i can do for you ?
anything at all ?
no .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
all rise !
staff sergeant nora swan ,
aircraft structural maintenance .
and the accused was your bunkmate at addis air force base ?
yes , sir .
and what did you observe
your bunkmate doing on the morning in question ?
ingesting adriphan .
this is a prescription stimulant
used to combat shift @-@ work sleep disorder ?
yes , sir .
it keeps you awake ?
yes , sir .
but it can also overstimulate , cause someone to overreact ...
objection . beyond the expertise .
i &apos;ll rephrase .
have you ever been warned about the side effects of adriphan ?
yes , sir .
it can make you jumpy .
react too quickly to stimuli .
thank you , sergeant .
sergeant , where did staff sergeant elkins get these pills ?
they were ... mine .
so you have a prescription for them ?
no .
but you were taking them--
these pills that tend to overstimulate ?
i was .
why ?
we &apos;re in double @-@ shifts on some days on maintenance .
you know , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s the only way to stay awake .
and you were fine with the risk of being overstimulated ?
objection .
i &apos;ll rephrase .
you testified that you did not
have a prescription for these pills ,
so where did you get them ?
where ?
yes , if you didn &apos;t get them from a medical specialist ,
you must have gotten them from somewhere .
i ...
i @-@ i &apos;d rather not say .
yes , and i &apos;d rather not ask .
from someone in the unit , ma &apos;am .
do other people in the unit take these pills ?
yes .
in fact , isn &apos;t it an open secret that adriphan
is taken by almost everyone , from fighter pilots to ... ?
objection , your honor . calls for speculation .
actually , i don &apos;t think it calls for much speculation at all .
mrs. florrick !
my apologies , your honor .
no further questions .
my parents always wanted me to take the corporate path .
but you were the rebel ?
i tried being a defense attorney , but ...
i realized i didn &apos;t like guilty people .
not that you do .
oh , no , i do . i love them .
that &apos;s why i work here .
this isn &apos;t going to go well , is it ?
nope .
this is where i sat when i was waiting to be fired .
really ?
do you have children , diane ?
i don &apos;t .
well , i found the best way to raise mine
was to tell them exactly what is expected of them ,
how they misbehaved , and what they have to do
to get back in my good graces .
i didn &apos;t even know you had graces ,
and suddenly i seem to be out of them .
no . i &apos;m speaking of your partner .
ah , will . well , actually , he &apos;s in court right now .
but why don &apos;t i tell him you dropped by ?
diane , i am leading an investigation into judicial bribery .
there are three judges on the bench
who are receiving payments in trade for their decisions .
really ?
who ?
we believe the nexus of that bribery scheme is will gardner .
it &apos;s always nice to know how my tax dollars are being spent .
mr. gardner has a wednesday night pick @-@ up game
involving lawyers and judges .
at these games , he &apos;s introduced judges to bookies
for the purposes of illegal betting .
the judges quickly get sucked into bigger bets ,
at which time the bookies forgive the debt
in trade for friendly sentences .
one thing i &apos;ve noticed about prosecutors , ms. scott @-@ carr :
they tend to treat accusations as facts .
we know your hands are clean , diane .
how do we know that ?
you &apos;re right .
we don &apos;t know your hands are clean .
you can demonstrate your hands are clean by talking with us .
well , look at this , my two favorite people .
cary .
kalinda .
did you get home all right ?
i did . thank you . whew , hangover .
nice jacket .
thanks . i think it &apos;s the same label .
thank you for the time .
no problem .
where &apos;s will ?
he &apos;s parking .
do you have a minute ?
you &apos;re being investigated .
i know . it &apos;s winding down .
it &apos;s not winding down .
peter florrick just assigned wendy scott @-@ carr
as a special prosecutor .
how do you know ?
she was just in my office ,
trying to turn me against you .
it &apos;s about lemond bishop . they &apos;re trying to use me ...
no , it &apos;s not .
we need to get out of the lemond bishop business ...
will , it &apos;s not . they &apos;re coming after you .
they say that just to scare you .
they say that because they have something .
judicial bribery .
what ?
your wednesday night basketball games .
she thinks you &apos;re introducing judges to bookies .
what ?
the judges bet on games , they can &apos;t pay ;
the bookies relieve the debt in trade for a lesser sentence .
i don &apos;t want you to say anything to me ...
but i want you to take care of this .
i will not let this firm go under
because of some s.a. fishing expedition ...
diane , it &apos;s not true ...
of course it &apos;s not true .
that &apos;s not the point .
make it go away .
stop it .
stop ... ?
alicia .
peter florrick is coming after you because you are sleeping with his wife .
don &apos;t lie to me .
it &apos;s wrong .
you are her boss . he is the state &apos;s attorney .
even if it weren &apos;t wrong , it &apos;s not smart .
stop sleeping with his wife .
do you understand me ?
you , gentlemen , are a grain , you are not a vegetable .
in fact , other vegetables gain more
by being associated with you than you with them .
that is why you were left with myplate .
where is corn ?
it is subsumed in &quot; vegetables . &quot;
but we aim to change all that .
with this .
a full @-@ body food chart .
with sections for fruits , dairy , breads .
and here ... corn is at the heart .
a place of prominence .
to reflect its importance in the american diet .
it is to all our benefit to rethink the current food chart .
and we need your help to encourage congress to ...
chin up .
eli . hi , how are you ?
i &apos;m good . so you &apos;re here ... ?
oh , just to chat with a few friends .
really ? how nice .
arthur , hi .
so you &apos;re trying to pull corn on board ?
on board ?
with you .
well , it &apos;s produce , isn &apos;t it ?
i thought we had a deal .
really ?
cheese and fruit ?
that was our agreement .
when you &apos;re dead , eli , you know what the polite thing is to do ?
get a shovel .
we think you should take ventura .
why ?
the sexism angle will come better from you .
we &apos;re worried it &apos;ll seem
like outsiders meddling if we go tough on him .
understood .
all rise !
uh , thank you for returning , lieutenant ventura .
um , you have testified that , uh ,
there was no delay in the stand @-@ down transmission
from the kill chain and that , therefore ,
uh , staff sergeant elkins overreacted .
yes , sir .
good . okay .
so , uh ...
okay . um ...
uh , so , um ...
have there been transmission delays in the past ? have there been ?
yes , but there wasn &apos;t one here .
sergeant elkins ignored the order .
i see .
and is that why you started an online petition in the spring
opposing the integration of females into the submarine force ?
because females can &apos;t take orders ?
objection , your honor . relevance .
i ... sustained .
lieutenant ventura ,
have you worked with other female airmen in the uav complex ?
yes , definitely .
and you have no issues working with female ncos ?
no , of course not . why ?
because i &apos;m asking you a question .
lieutenant ventura ,
who is staff sergeant montoya ?
sergeant montoya worked as a sensor operator
in the uav last year . she has since been removed .
and she was removed because you complained about her ?
no , sir . she was being disruptive during our shifts .
so you had her replaced ?
no , i told my commanding officer , and he replaced her .
understood .
and how many other ncos have you worked beside without incident ?
dozens . this was my first incident .
a female ?
yes , but that &apos;s incidental .
so it &apos;s incidental that out of the dozens
of ncos you &apos;ve worked with over the years ,
you &apos;ve had complaints only about two females ?
yes , sir .
who works with you now ?
i don &apos;t understand the question .
now that you &apos;ve had staff sergeant elkins replaced ...
objection .
sustained .
now that you &apos;re working with someone other than staff sergeant elkins ,
are there any complaints ?
no . i work well with people .
is staff sergeant elkins &apos; replacement a male or a female ?
a male .
understood .
thank you for your honesty .
hello , jackie .
alicia .
i @-@ i was , uh ...
my key seems to be sticking .
i know .
you changed the locks ?
i did .
would you like to explain why ?
sure . i don &apos;t want you in here anymore .
you don &apos;t want me picking up zach and grace ?
i don &apos;t .
but i can &apos;t control what peter needs from you .
what you need from me , too , alicia .
but i can control my home .
i don &apos;t want you in here , jackie .
i don &apos;t want you going through my things .
i don &apos;t want you in my computer .
you &apos;re hurting your children .
i might be , but that &apos;s between me and them ,
and i would never take your word for it .
they &apos;re not safe with you .
go ahead , jackie-- reach into that bag of tricks .
what do you have that could hurt me ?
zach is dating eli gold &apos;s daughter .
oh , my gosh . that &apos;s terrible .
they were in your bedroom .
should i get a chair for this ?
grace goes into her bedroom with her tutor and locks the door .
well , it would help if you got your facts straight , jackie .
there is no lock on grace &apos;s door .
she pushes the chair against it .
look at me , jackie .
look at my face .
you no longer have the power to wound .
they &apos;re your children .
you need to be their mother .
good night , jackie .
zach ?
hey , mom . what &apos;s up ?
jackie drives you over to dad &apos;s now ?
yeah . why ?
get your coat . let &apos;s buy you a car .
no , i understand . i &apos;ll just keep in touch .
thank you .
that didn &apos;t sound good .
we &apos;re out of the cheese business .
the dairy people want a change of direction .
they &apos;re going with stacie hall .
i explained she made no sense since she represents fruit , too .
but they thought a nonsensical plan made more sense than i did .
i need something to drink .
well , don &apos;t get morose .
why not ?
it deserves a little wallowing , don &apos;t you think ?
four or five million a year between us .
nora , why don &apos;t i have scotch ? !
win them back .
oh , yes , you &apos;re right .
what was i thinking ?
do men really have that much success in their life
that the first setback that comes along ,
they get all weepy ?
i &apos;m not weepy .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m tired .
it &apos;s hard doing this .
i don &apos;t sleep at night .
i stare at the clock , i think about nothing else .
and it &apos;s not productive time .
it &apos;s stare @-@ at @-@ the @-@ clock time .
you can always give up .
can i just have a minute to feel bad for myself ?
yes , i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t like losing .
i &apos;m always looking for when things start to turn south .
what if it &apos;s now ?
eli , we &apos;re gonna wallow for a few hours now .
we &apos;ll drink .
i &apos;ll put you in a cab .
you will sleep it off .
you won &apos;t feel good in the morning .
you will come in late , but you will come in .
we &apos;ll sit , we &apos;ll talk .
you &apos;ve been lording it over us up until now .
i have not .
yes , you have . don &apos;t argue .
you are brilliant , but you &apos;re not god &apos;s gift .
we &apos;ll sit and talk .
we &apos;ll hatch a plan .
and stacie hall is going to rue the day .
and that &apos;s a fact .
but for the moment ...
members of the panel , have you reached a verdict ?
staff sergeant regina elkins , please stand .
&quot; in the matter of the united states v.
&quot; staff sergeant regina e. elkins ,
&quot; on the charge of murder under section 118 of the uniform code
&quot; of military justice , count one ,
&quot; we the panel find the accused guilty .
&quot; on the charge of murder under section 118
&quot; of the uniform code , count two ,
&quot; we the panel find the accused guilty .
&quot; on the charge of murder under section 118 of the uniform code ,
&quot; count three , we the panel find the accused guilty .
&quot; on the charge of murder under section 118
&quot; of the uniform code , count four ,
we the panel find the accused guilty . &quot;
you thought it was unjust ?
yes .
why ?
she was scapegoated .
she &apos;s being sent to prison
because she was used as a scapegoat
for an inaccurate drone program .
no . she was convicted because she did wrong .
she was a woman , that was her only ...
oh , please .
do you know what that defense says
about the thousands of women who serve honorably ?
we don &apos;t want that defense .
this isn &apos;t about want . this is about truth .
and the truth is there are 12 people dead
because of sergeant elkins &apos; actions .
she went to work incapacitated by drugs
and she killed 12 people . six children .
you didn &apos;t ask one word about them .
they are dead .
they burned to death .
children like yours .
children like mine .
their mothers are mourning them right now .
she may be pushing buttons , but they are dead .
and they did nothing wrong .
this was a just verdict .
it was .
and she will serve time for that .
the problem with the charge of scapegoating is
that it doesn &apos;t acknowledge at a certain point
you have to hold people accountable .
that is what &apos;s happening here .
that &apos;s all .
i have to go now .
