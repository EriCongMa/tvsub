... to you .
that was weird--how come we only sang the last two words ?
what happened to the happy birthday part ?
well , you know troy &apos;s a jehovah &apos;s witness .
he doesn &apos;t celebrate birthdays .
annie and i did our best
to keep the language on the cake compliant .
&quot; hello during a random dessert ,
&quot; the month and day of which coincide numerically
with your expulsion from a uterus . &quot;
you guys , i never cry , but ...
all right . happy expulsion , troy ,
but after cake , we cram for realsies .
guys , finals are coming up .
yeah . this group is starting to use special occasions
to avoid studying .
last week we had fondue and played boggle
because shirley &apos;s niece took her first bath .
with bubbles .
thank you . it &apos;s a milestone .
funny , because last week was my birthday ,
and nobody noticed and nobody cared .
pierce ...
you don &apos;t remember the huge party we threw ?
we need to talk about those pain killers you &apos;re taking
because i don &apos;t think you &apos;re remembering anything .
that was a huge party .
it was the best party of my life !
gotcha !
of course i remember my birthday .
what a party .
yeah , you still owe me for the cake deposit .
oh , you think i don &apos;t know that ?
troy ...
troy .
第二季第十集
kick puncher : detroit ! no way !
this is sold out everywhere !
not everywhere .
i got a cousin in detroit .
they &apos;re not crazy about it up there .
this is how you turn 20 . thanks !
ooh , there &apos;s strawberries under there .
here , let me , uh , help you with that .
i broke my legs , not my gender .
okay .
while we &apos;re ... watching this unfold ,
some birthday facts to enjoy .
troy &apos;s birthday is tomorrow , december 4th .
also born that day , tyra banks ...
ugh .
marisa tomei ...
and french cinematographer claude renoir .
yes ! jackpot !
on the chinese calendar , troy is a horse .
like me .
&quot; purposeful , self @-@ possessed , and gregarious . &quot;
no . i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m a snake .
i remember because i &apos;m determined , self @-@ possessed ,
and mendacious .
pierce , what is this ? what are you doing ?
explain yourself .
who made this crappy cake anyway ?
a cake maker . at a cake store .
they did it wrong .
troy , we &apos;re 1990 . we &apos;re horses .
i was born in &apos; 89 .
then ...
you were born 21 years ago .
which would make me 20,
because everyone is 10 for two years .
because fifth grade is really hard for every ... one .
mom , how many lies have i been living !
troy , do you realize at midnight you are turning 21
as in &quot; the legal drinking age &quot; ?
whoa !
this party just became unacceptable--we &apos;re going out .
yep !
but you guys were just
complaining about us having too many parties .
too many lame ones . this is real .
well , what makes it real ?
well , shirley , think of it
as troy taking his first bath ,
only the bubbles are his manhood .
yes . i wanna bathe in manhood .
i &apos;m taking you to l street .
douche street .
oh , of course you hate cool bars .
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;ve ever even been to l street .
no . but i also haven &apos;t been to beirut .
but i &apos;m sure i will go one day ,
because i hear they have lots of important cultural--
it &apos;s my birthday .
unlike l street , which is douchey .
all right , let &apos;s hear your great suggestions .
the red door .
oh , yeah , the red door !
the red hipster .
not hipster .
hipsters haven &apos;t discovered it yet .
it &apos;s underground .
why don &apos;t we go someplace fun like peg leg pablo &apos;s ?
they serve virgin mudslides .
those are milk shakes , shirley .
you guys ! all you think about is yourselves .
think about me . i &apos;m 19 . i can &apos;t get into bars .
yeah , sorry .
okay , well ...
have fun .
fine . i &apos;ll get annie an i.d.
a fake i.d. ?
it will be real .
it just won &apos;t be yours .
i will see you at the red door .
nice try . we &apos;re not going to red poet &apos;s society .
well , we &apos;re not going to douche street either .
fine . count of three , name the least offensive bar
you &apos;ve ever been to .
one , two , three .
flannahan &apos;s hole .
done . troy , you ride with me ?
do you even have to ask ?
pierce , do you wanna ride in my van ?
i &apos;m not a disabled .
i don &apos;t need people helping me
do normal things and doting over me ...
why don &apos;t you just leave--
okay ! i &apos;ll beat you there .
i don &apos;t think this girl looks very much like me .
come on . she &apos;s a white brunette .
so is anne hathaway .
go on ?
what &apos;s your friend doing
with a stack of other people &apos;s ids .
i don &apos;t know-- sometimes people sell their i.d.
when they &apos;re leaving the state and need cash .
so she &apos;s a drifter .
a floater .
an urchin .
caroline decker from ccorpus christi , texas .
texas ? do i need an accent ?
you don &apos;t need an accent .
howdy , y &apos;all . i &apos;m caroline decker .
please don &apos;t do that .
i guar @-@ un @-@ tee !
that &apos;s cajun .
cajun .
i should research corpus christi .
annie , relax .
i &apos;m not a relaxed person , britta .
i think ahead . i prepare .
i don &apos;t improvise my life like ... caroline decker ,
who probably has really bad credit
and an unfinished mermaid tattoo .
what ?
flannahan &apos;s hole is closed .
that &apos;s not a-- i @-@ i &apos;m not being clever .
i mean it &apos;s out of business .
well , that &apos;s what they get for trying to please everyone .
so now what ?
well , there &apos;s a place
at third and water .
it &apos;s fun , divey ,
but not staph infection divey .
it &apos;s either got a gross name or an ironically fancy one .
possibly both .
oh . the ballroom . good .
go to third and water .
wait--what ?
that wasn &apos;t the deal !
shirley &apos;s pushing back .
why , because they don &apos;t have plastic menus and milk shakes ?
why , because they don &apos;t--
don &apos;t repeat that , you goon !
jeez . look , just-- the women are your problem ,
and the men are going to the ballroom .
and now i guess i am being clever .
so ... plastic menus are bad ?
see , this is the kinda stuff i need to learn .
plastic menus seems like a great idea to me
for when you spill something on them ,
and then your mom says , &quot; hey , troy ,
you &apos;re ruining fuddruckers for everyone . &quot;
troy ... you &apos;re entering the next chapter of your life .
sadly , it &apos;s the final chapter ,
but it &apos;s also the longest .
and if you play it right , the best .
you and i ... we &apos;re just two guys now .
peers . equals .
so awesome .
maybe later you &apos;ll let me drive your car .
hello , former enemy .
he &apos;s 21 at midnight . cool ?
yeah . happy birthday .
thanks .
uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t like this place .
ugh . you made that clear , shirley . oy vey .
caroline decker from corpus christi .
annie , you don &apos;t need an accent .
if my i.d. says texas , they &apos;ll be suspicious .
they &apos;re not gonna question your i.d.
because you &apos;re a hot girl .
we &apos;re good for business .
the hotter you are ,
the more they &apos;ll risk the fine .
howdy ?
go ahead .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
can &apos;t be too careful .
i understand .
hey , hey , shirley !
welcome back !
you don &apos;t know me . hmm ?
okay ?
yeah .
this place is all right !
yeah . it &apos;s okay .
these pictures must be of all the regulars .
you think someday i can make it up to this wall ?
i don &apos;t say this often , troy , but ...
dream a little smaller .
can i get you guys anything ?
i @-@ i &apos;m okay !
another macallan . neat .
vodka . neat . four olives .
i &apos;m waiting till midnight .
sweetie ?
water !
oh , where &apos;s that accent from ?
corpus christi . texas .
78418 .
what are you doin &apos; here in town ?
not much , i reckon ...
just driftin &apos; , floatin &apos; ,
spittin &apos; in the wind .
general waywardness .
all righty .
annie , you &apos;re in the bar .
you don &apos;t have to be from texas anymore .
i don &apos;t know how it works .
i &apos;m not a barfly , britta .
they have asteroids . slide out .
o @-@ okay . oh ! oh ! okay .
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna go take a little look around .
me too .
annie .
don &apos;t accept any drinks .
or invitations to the bathroom .
so what are you gonna order for your first legal drink ?
what should i get ?
whatever you want .
no wrong answers .
i like beer .
don &apos;t order beer .
you &apos;ve had beer .
w @-@ what should i get ?
well , what do you think you might like ?
i mean , it &apos;s your world now .
follow your heart .
my uncle carl
played a big role in my life .
he taught me how to throw a football .
he ... he passed away this year .
his favorite drink was a seven and seven .
don &apos;t order that .
that &apos;s an awful drink .
you &apos;re better than that .
that &apos;s a high school drink for girls .
actually , i &apos;ll have a root beer
instead of that water .
sure thing .
thank you kindly .
y &apos;all are so nice in this town .
i &apos;m caroline . from corpus christi .
grew up on a trout farm .
deedly @-@ do . * doo doo doo doo
oh , careful .
you score any higher on this thing ,
the rylans are gonna recruit you
to fight against the ko @-@ dan empire .
the last starfighter .
did you get the 25th anniversary blu @-@ ray ?
was scorpius half @-@ scarran , half @-@ peacekeeper ?
frell , yes , i got starfighter on blu @-@ ray .
you &apos;re a fan of the sci @-@ fi original series farscape .
can i buy you a drink ?
you got some id ?
very funny , punk .
get outta my way !
i don &apos;t know how people like you even get jobs today .
hey , do you need help , man ?
you &apos;d like that , wouldn &apos;t you ? ha ha !
a little turning of the tables .
the turning of what tables ?
i don &apos;t know ! leave me alone !
so i punched her .
right in the face .
your probation officer ?
didn &apos;t you get in trouble ?
hell , yes , i got in trouble !
wasn &apos;t the first time . won &apos;t be the last .
i &apos;m not exactly known for my sound judgment .
back in corpus christi , they call me capricious caroline .
what &apos;s capricious mean ?
probably means i &apos;m ...
too busy livin &apos; life to be learnin &apos; $ 5 @-@ words .
ha ha ! hot damn !
with an aged scotch , never use ice .
never use ice . got it .
why ?
destroys it .
at most , what you want-- two drops of spring water .
activates the flavor .
good lord .
do they have the rules to high @-@ maintenance poser drinker
on the wall at l street ?
do they ?
poser drinking ?
hey , miss vodka , need four olives .
what &apos;s that called , the too @-@ cool @-@ to @-@ care @-@ tini ?
is it ?
i bet the forced starkness of that drink order
turns a lotta horn @-@ rimmed heads at the red door .
i can &apos;t wait to understand these arguments !
hey , y &apos;all , &apos; nother round for ya .
everybody holdin &apos; up ?
i &apos;ll be back in two shakes of a rabbit &apos;s ass .
who the hell was that ?
i gotta go see a woman
about the female equivalent of a horse .
classy . way to show troy the ropes .
shut up , l street .
that woman is a hurricane .
yeah .
hurricanes are bad , troy .
i know .
i always thought it &apos;s possible
that the wormhole crichton fell through
moved him across not only space but also time ,
which would suggest that the sebaceans are our future selves
and crichton is longing for a planet that no longer exists .
ha . hey , you &apos;re really nursing that beer .
ahh . which would make sense ,
because what kind of wormhole would it be
if it could only move from one place to another
within the same galaxy on the same day ?
you know , speaking of wormholes ,
uh , whaddaya say we use one to ...
teleport this conversation someplace a little more private ?
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
wormholes and teleportation are two different things .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been talking about this whole time .
i noticed .
cheers .
i followed that band phish-- spells it with &quot; ph. &quot;
i just lived in parking lots wherever they played .
i don &apos;t even like their music .
just did it to see if i could do it .
and guess what . i could !
so what now ?
i dunno !
even if i planned it , plans just fall off me
like chicken crap off an armadilla .
annie &apos;s the one that plans things , not me .
annie &apos;s my friend . she goes to school here .
thinks she &apos;s got it all figured out .
she wants to major in healthcare management .
what does that even mean ?
no idea .
i &apos;ll tell you what it means .
it means a master &apos;s degree followed by an internship .
she &apos;s got the next 15 years of her life
all mapped out , and all she gotta do now
is just follow it or screw it up .
another soda ?
actually , gimme a screwdriver .
i got no place to be .
what am i ... annie ?
the first season , when you watch it the second time ,
is better than the third season , and the fourth season ,
when you watch it the fifth time--
okay . um ... what &apos;s your name ?
abed .
abed , i &apos;m robert .
hey , robert .
abed , would you like to have ...
gay sex ... with me ?
no , thank you .
wow .
okay , so ... what is wrong with you
that you can sit here this whole time
and never pick up on the fact that a man is hitting on you ?
oh , i actually did pick up on it after a while .
you actually--
and ?
i really , really like talking about farscape .
it &apos;s a really good show .
stargate &apos;s better .
battery depleted .
oh , man .
that is wrong !
wait .
hey , there !
what you been up to ?
i was just , uh ,
praying for these poor souls in these photographs .
oh , that &apos;s nice , but , uh ...
you missed one .
i found it in the ladies room .
uh ... give that to me ?
no , no , come on ! don &apos;t feel bad .
this makes us like you way more .
you think this is really funny .
yeah .
yeah , a little .
i had some bad years .
with a chaser .
come on . it &apos;s a funny picture ,
because you act so perfect all the time .
and because you look like a zombie ,
but it &apos;s not funny when you &apos;re sad .
we &apos;re on your team . relax .
sit down . it &apos;s my birthday .
give it to me .
give it to me .
see you all on monday .
shirley . wait .
what ?
nothing.get out of my way !
i can &apos;t get out of your way .
i &apos;m stuck in this place-- the chair broke--
i mean , i can &apos;t get--
could you p @-@ please help me ?
pretty please ?
thank you , shirley .
you &apos;re welcome , jackass .
hey , um , it &apos;s my birthday ,
and technically , i &apos;m not allowed to drink for another 45 seconds .
well , actually , it &apos;ll be 30 seconds by the time i &apos;m done saying this .
but can i have a seven and seven ?
it &apos;s on the house . happy birthday , kid .
i prefer that to avatar .
i &apos;d rather have my eyes gouged out .
big boy . big , big boy .
troy .
i think i owe you a birthday .
i &apos;m cool .
i actually always wanted to drive this thing .
what ?
this is my car ?
don &apos;t crash it .
i &apos;m not gonna crash it !
crash it , troy .
go to sleep , britta . go to sleep .
crash his car , troy !
seems like a really dark chapter in our group story .
go to sleep , abed .
cool .
hey , that &apos;s the place that we shoulda gone to tonight !
yeah , l street . exactly .
it &apos;s the red door , stupid !
you see a sign that says l street ?
l street is too cool to have a sign .
it &apos;s called l street after the street it &apos;s on .
the red door &apos;s on l street .
l street has a red door .
it &apos;s the same bar ?
you two have been saying one bar is lame
and the other one is awesome all night ...
and it &apos;s the same bar ?
well , he probably was around friday nights ,
which was lame .
you wish !
stop . just stop .
i just spent the last two years
thinking that you guys knew more than me about life ,
and i just found out that you guys are just as dumb as me .
duh @-@ doy .
yeah . duh @-@ doy .
got it .
duh @-@ doy .
duh @-@ doy .
you can take me home first .
i only live a few blocks from here .
you do ?
hey , this is a really terrible neighborhood .
yeah .
this is my apartment .
weird night , huh ?
yeah . alcohol makes people sad .
it &apos;s like the lifetime movies of beverages .
i pretended to be a different person tonight .
abed does that like three times a week .
but i did it because i didn &apos;t wanna be me .
i @-@ i did it because
i &apos;m not sure who i am .
admit it--we went to school together for four years ,
and you didn &apos;t even know me .
yeah , but ... i know you now .
you &apos;re annie .
you like puzzles and ...
little monsters on your pencil
and some guy named mark ruffalo .
you &apos;re a fierce competitor and a sore loser .
and you expect everybody to be better than who they are
and you expect yourself to be better than everyone .
which is cool .
good night .
guess everyone &apos;s gonna be pretty embarrassed on monday , huh ?
naw . everybody just got a little bit drunk .
nobody did anything that bad , right ?
no , wait , wait , wait .
what are we doing ?
yeah . what are we doing ?
this is a bad idea , right ?
yeah .
okay .
i flew off the handle earlier .
i apologize .
they were making out .
abed !
abed , why would you say that ?
why would you do it in front of me ?
i &apos;m not a coat rack .
abed .
no one likes a tattle tail .
happy birthday , troy .
thanks .
you &apos;re a man now .
this is gonna be big enough .
