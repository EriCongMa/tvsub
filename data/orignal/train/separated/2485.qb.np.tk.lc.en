i &apos;ve had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags .
they pee all night , they cry all day ,
and every time they use the computer , the font is huge .
dad , did it ever occur to you that we &apos;re learning
how to take care of you when you &apos;re older
by watching the way you treat grampa ?
have you seen how he treats my grampa ?
never visits him .
never even acknowledges his existence .
your grampa &apos;s alive ?
oh , yeah .
okay ...
well , can you please be nicer to our grampa ?
for me ? i love grampa .
you may not realize it , but he &apos;s a treasure .

okay .
you know , i love him , too .
in a manly way .
that never shows itself .
now , we &apos;re going to need
three hearing aid batteries ,
all different and hard to get .
and this has to be in the fridge , next to the butter .
and the butter has to be open .
oh , i &apos;ll see what i can do .
i can handle them from now on , marge .
gentlemen , i &apos;ve been thinking .
my glorious youth and beauty won &apos;t last forever .
someday , when the leaves have turned
and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese ,
i will be old .
what &apos;s your point , pound cake ?
i &apos;m hoping we can find a way to coexist .
what did he say ?
he wants to see if ghosts exist .
ooh , they do .
my uncle bill is here right now .
oh , bill , bill , i &apos;m so sorry
i wasn &apos;t a very good ladder holder .
that &apos;s all right . enough about that .
did the clock ever get wound ?
this can only be good .
this family &apos;s had a lot of hoods put over their heads .
uh , chief , something about that looks fishy .

you know , &apos; cause you open your yap
when things get hot . &quot; clambake . &quot;
all right , take off his hood .

then he called the police when a frisbee landed on our lawn .
then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream ,
but he only brought a nickel .
i didn &apos;t mind that he grew bald .
i didn &apos;t mind that he got fat .
i didn &apos;t mind that he got fatter .
but no one told me he &apos;d get older than me .
