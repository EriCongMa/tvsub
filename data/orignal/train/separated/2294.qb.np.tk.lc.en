killian , we &apos;re here to help you .
we just can &apos;t find you . where are you ?
in an underground prison .
the underworld .
i &apos;ll only be gone for a day .
come back to me .
i always do .
and those people you came down with ...
maybe one of them doesn &apos;t make the trip back ,
but your dear old dad does .
not interested .
not yet .
for every soul your friends free ,
one of them is going to have to stay .
you get to decide who .
oh , come on .
all you need to do is choose three of your friends
to stay here .
carve their name .
w @-@ what &apos;s the problem ?
is it the chisel ?
so unwieldy for the one @-@ handed .
or writer &apos;s block ?
i &apos;m not doing it .
i must say ... i &apos;m not angry .
i &apos;m disappointed .
and on second thought ...
i &apos;m angry .
i guess it &apos;s off to solitary .
listen carefully .
this is the river of lost souls .
touch it and it will make you lost .
reducing you to a mindless , tormented husk .
so please , keep all arms and hand inside the boat .
father ?
&quot; my son -- this shop is yours to do with as you wish .
and my offer still stands .
use what &apos;s in the case when you want to accept it ,
and we can be a family again .
your father . &quot;
show me ...
show me who i seek .
oh , no !
oh , belle .
oh , belle .
found more arrows .
you do not want to see what that helldog did upstairs .
so , we think we &apos;re ready ?
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re gonna get hook . what &apos;s it look like ?
we know hades will have him in some sort of isolation .
meg told us there &apos;s an entrance nearby .
so all 45 of you are gonna slip down
into the deepest level of detention in the underworld .
hades knows you &apos;re here .
he &apos;ll have put up barriers to keep the living out
of all the places he doesn &apos;t want us going .
you walk into his domain , you &apos;ll all be puffs of dust .
so we get a new plan .
correct .
five of you occupy yourselves as you will .
perhaps cleaning ?
you and i will go in
with the assistance of a helpful dead person .
i can extend their aura , if you will ,
so that two living souls can get through hades &apos; barrier .
wait a minute .
yesterday , you hid in your shop .
today , you &apos;re gonna lead the charge to find a man that you hate ?
yeah , because i @-@ i realized that if i don &apos;t step in ,
we are never gonna get home ,
and i want very much to get home to my wife .
okay .
so how do we get a helpful dead person
to loan their aura so we can confront
the god of the underworld himself ?
you leave that to me .
i &apos;ve got someone in mind .
someone i &apos;ve known a long time .
milah .
milah !
you don &apos;t have to be doing this yourself .
i said i would help .
you said that .
and somehow , it still didn &apos;t get done .
well , i was chasing dragonflies with the boy .
did he protect you from the big ones ?
i know my leg slows me down around here ,
but i @-@ i can do better .
i can change .
you &apos;re never going to change , rumple .
i can .
i can be whatever you want me to be .
just go play with the boy .
that &apos;s one thing you can do , at least .
bae !
bae ?
bae , what &apos;s wrong , son ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
morning , dearie .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not dead .
just visiting .
how &apos;d you find me ?
you are standing in the middle of main street , so , you know ...
i must say , i do love the irony of your job .
you watching children ,
keeping them safe , keeping them close .
what do you want ?
i have an opportunity for you .
a romantic adventure to save the man you once loved .
you ?
i &apos;m talking about killian jones .
killian ...
is here ?
he &apos;s receiving some , uh , special attention from hades .
i need to retrieve him .
i &apos;m supposed to watch the kids .
well , they &apos;re dead anyway .
it &apos;s quite simple , really .
can you stand helping me if it lets you save him ?
now , i want you to think about why you &apos;re here .
you tried to escape .
you freed another prisoner .
you refuse to do what i ask ,
and do you know the most important reason ?
i couldn &apos;t begin to guess .
hope .
you and your colleagues brought contraband , hope , into my world ,
and that is strictly forbidden .
and despite some ... creative beatings ,
i still see hope in your eyes .
now , i would like that to be gone
before you reach the water .
you have interfered with my
carefully cultivated existence , so ...
i am going to hurt you .
then i &apos;m going to collect your friends
and hurt them .
so there &apos;s going to be no one left to save you .
feel free ... to go mad .
her ?
yes , her . come .
let me introduce you .
miss swan ?
there &apos;s someone i &apos;d like you to meet .
this is milah , my ex @-@ wife .
and hook &apos;s ex , also .
she &apos;s also baelfire &apos;s mother , of course .
emma knew him as neal .
they had a torrid affair ,
which resulted in a scandalous teenage pregnancy .
in prison .
yeah , well --
so , you &apos;ve been with my former lover ...
and my son ?
is that right ?
i &apos;m sure we &apos;re gonna laugh ourselves sick
about all this one day .
i suggest you follow me before this gets even more awkward .
hey , where &apos;s your boss ?
no , not some deity -- your boss here
the blind witch ?
never mind .
you .
hello , darling .
you can help .
i can ?
i mean , of course i can .
tell me about the graveyard .
i need to find someone .
oh , it &apos;s just a chat you want .
well , if you &apos;re looking for someone ,
simply use your magic .
having trouble , are we ?
magic &apos;s a little tricky down here , isn &apos;t it , darling ?
let &apos;s sit down and be civilized .
the way in is here ?
so , what , the gates of hell are in my house ?
as was the stone of excalibur .
the pirate has a knack for targeting real estate
with hidden value .
basement door ?
basement door .
it &apos;s a barrier , all right .
so what is she gonna do ?
joining hands will be fine .
it worked .
indeed .
one step closer to hell .
ex @-@ excuse us .
fendrake the healer ?
s @-@ sorry to bother you , sir .
i @-@ it &apos;s our son .
oh , my ...
we -- we -- we left him at home ,
thinking it might be too dangerous to move him .
we need the antidote to this .
atlantean rat snake .
it &apos;s a 24 @-@ hour poison .
your boy will die tomorrow .
no ! no .
unless you &apos;re willing to use magic .
magic ! we -- we &apos;ll pay anything !
what magic ?
there is a potion to cure your child .
it &apos;s very rare .
how much ?
100 gold pieces .
100 gold !
we won &apos;t see that in our lives .
no , but we &apos;ll get our cure anyway .
how ?
you &apos;ll go back and take it .
take it ? !
he &apos;d kill me for sure .
oh , now , there &apos;s a puzzle you &apos;ll have to figure out .
he can &apos;t kill you if you get him first .
the spell &apos;s gone .
we &apos;ll be able to pass through on our own now .
thank you , milah .
you can run back to protecting the dead children .
hang on .
milah ...
thank you so much .
and ...
there &apos;s something you should know .
your son , neal , baelfire ...
when i was on my way down here on the river ,
i had sort of a vision of him .
i think he talked to me .
what did he say ?
he said that he moved on .
and that he was happy .
whatever he had to resolve ...
he did it .
thank you .
thank you so much .
i hear water this way .
that would be the river of lost souls .
we can take it to where hades will have killian .
i &apos;m sorry , uh , &quot; we &quot; can take it ?
if you think you can get the pirate back ,
i doubt he &apos;s gonna swap the blonde for the dead woman .
you might be dark ,
but sometimes you &apos;re still an idiot , rumple .
i have my reasons .
let me come with you .
okay .
i see you &apos;re admiring my fur .
doe skin , of all things .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s bambi &apos;s iconic dead mother .
and i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s not .
just tell me about the graveyard .
if i find a headstone ,
does that mean that person &apos;s here in ... &quot; underbrooke &quot; ?
underbrooke .
oh , you are clever .
no , it just means they &apos;re passing through , that &apos;s all .
who are you looking for ?
well , never mind who .
i just ...
i want to know where they are .
i have a map here .
now that i &apos;ve been made mayor .
oh , thanks to your recently departed mother .
it &apos;s got a list of cemetery plots ,
and you have to know how to interpret the headstones .
you see , there &apos;s three --
what would you call them ? settings ?
if the headstone is upright ,
it means the person is still here in town .
if it &apos;s tipped over ,
it means their soul has gone on to a better place , okay ?
happy person , tippy stone .
and the third setting ?
if it &apos;s cracked ...
well , that &apos;s bad .
bad ?
they got pulled under to ...
wherever is worse than this place ?
yes .
but no one who &apos;s anyone goes there anymore .
i hope this boat you found doesn &apos;t spring a leak .
this boat is the best thing we could have hoped to find .
after we pick up the pirate ,
it will take us all the way home .
this is it .
he &apos;s down there . i feel it .
i &apos;m not leaving the boat .
it &apos;s too valuable .
you &apos;re capable of getting the pirate on your own , i &apos;m sure .
and don &apos;t even think about using magic .
hades would notice anything this close to his home base .
if he &apos;s not moving , i &apos;m not , either .
if he tries to steal this thing , i &apos;ll give a shout .
for god &apos;s sake , rumple ,
it &apos;s a dagger , not a dragon .
don &apos;t be scared of it .
i &apos;m scared because our son is dying .
he should be with us , not some village nursemaid .
i didn &apos;t spend our last gold coin on a knife
to slice the roast at his wake .
bae only has a couple of hours left .
let &apos;s spend that time doing something to help him ,
something -- something brave .
for once .
now go .
all right .
oh , did i make you do that ?
oh , that &apos;s a nice dress and a pretty girl .
stop it . i don &apos;t need that .
no , i got it . i got it .
leave the lady alone .
i &apos;m fine .
or what ?
well ...
thank you , sir .
captain killian jones .
at your service , ma &apos;am .
that doesn &apos;t look to be the uniform of any navy i &apos;ve ...
you &apos;re -- - well , they call us pirates .
we sail where we will and answer to no crown .
i &apos;ve not seen the ocean much beyond our small port .
is it wonderful to travel so much ?
aye .
do you know ...
... there are cities where the air smells of spices ...
and women are carried on jeweled chairs ?
would you like to see that ?
w @-@ well ...
i would love that , but ...
... i have responsibilities here .
an ailing child .
husband .
a husband .
well ...
it would appear a better man than i has won .
but i am in port quite often ...
should that ever change .
it -- it won &apos;t .
but thank you .
killian !
killian .
hang on ! i &apos;m coming for you !
i got you !
killian .
i told you to let me go .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
nobody should .
i never listen .
you &apos;re impossible .
and you love me for it .
so ... you &apos;re married now .
that &apos;s real .
look , about your , uh , unfinished business ...
if it is love for the pirate ,
then it &apos;s definitely off the table .
my unfinished business was never killian .
then why --
it &apos;s baelfire .
our son .
i should have been there for him .
not ...
punished him because i &apos;d ...
grown to hate his father .
i was selfish .
i thought if i could ...
change that , do something generous ...
maybe i could finish what i need to .
so you want to move on .
yeah .
so i can ...
see him , and i can ...
say to him , &quot; son , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry for ... everything . &quot;
he &apos;ll forgive you .
i betrayed him , as well .
as a grown man , he re @-@ entered my life ,
and he forgave me .
he &apos;ll do the same for you .
that &apos;s a nice thought .
it &apos;s just ...
i really want to see him again .
you will .
and when you do ...
... tell him hello from his papa .
who &apos;s here ?
you .
i can kill you with a single spell .
oh , i @-@ i don &apos;t need a spell .
i &apos;ve got a knife !
then do it .
i can &apos;t .
i just can &apos;t .
of course not .
thank you .
how much does your son mean to you ?
everything .
then you can leave here with the cure .
but i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t have any gold .
i &apos;ve just got a knife .
there will be a terrible price to pay , but not in gold .
if you &apos;re interested ...
we can make a deal .
i don &apos;t know much about deals , but ...
if i can save my son &apos;s life , i will trade anything .
they should be back by now .
they all look so lost .
yes .
yes , they do .
get your hand off that squiggly little thing .
i &apos;m not here to fight .
yeah , well , perhaps i am .
even when i &apos;m here to talk about a deal .
a deal ?
let &apos;s chat .
thank you for coming .
of course .
i couldn &apos;t let you do this alone .
two ...
i found him .
it &apos;s okay , you can look .
it &apos;s tipped .
he &apos;s not ...
here .
he &apos;s moved on .
he &apos;s happy .
daniel ...
... i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re somewhere better .
but i &apos;m also sorry i missed the chance to see you .
you were my first love , daniel ,
and you will always live in my heart .
i just needed to know you were okay .
you knew we were there the whole time .
yes . you betcha .
you know , i &apos;m a fan of yours .
i mean , there are dark ones , and then there is you .
you &apos;re quite the worthy rival to my hot throne .
so is this how you treat rivals ?
did i say &quot; rival &quot; ?
i meant &quot; supplier . &quot;
you &apos;ve sent so many lovely dead people my way .
i mean , regina does okay ,
but you &apos;ve been at it longer ,
and she &apos;s gotten , you know , ugh lately .
so what i really need is
you back up there doing your thing ,
and your friends --
i want them down here , not doing their thing ,
because frankly , they piss me off .
so i need you to sink that boat you found
because it &apos;s their way out of here .
well , i was gonna use that boat , too .
no problem .
i &apos;ll just wave my manicured hand ,
and boom , you &apos;ll be in bed with mrs. dark one by 10 : 00 .
you in ?
well , you can destroy that boat yourself , i have no doubt .
i could do it myself , yes ,
but i want you to do it .
so , are you a man i can do business with ,
or do i simply have to kill all of you ?
but my ex @-@ wife saw you just now .
she &apos;ll tell everyone .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s a puzzle you can solve .
now , just how eager are you to get home ?
milah !
i got it !
you got it ? !
bae , drink it up .
you did it .
i just thought about what mattered .
well , the healer ...
do we have to go back and hide his body ?
how did you leave him ?
no , alive and well .
milah , this worked out better than we thought .
i didn &apos;t even have to steal it .
tell me more .
well , i had him .
he was half asleep , i had the knife at his throat ,
a @-@ and then it came to me in a flash .
i thought , i @-@ if i kill to save my son ,
then my son grows up with a murderer , a monster as a father .
well , i @-@ i couldn &apos;t do that .
what are you talking about , rumple ?
he gave me the cure because we made a deal .
he wanted something else instead of gold .
what did you give him ?
i signed a paper promising him my second @-@ born child .
you ... you sold our child ?
no . no , no , no . th @-@ that &apos;s it .
i mean , i didn &apos;t .
w @-@ we don &apos;t have a second @-@ born child .
we just have to make sure we never do .
because you sold them !
you sold our future .
no .
our family .
rumple ...
papa ?
bae !
oh , bae ! bae . oh !
bae , you &apos;re all right .
you &apos;re all right .
you &apos;re all right .
you go back to sleep .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
oh , milah .
bae can be all the future we need .
well ...
... thank you very much ...
for deciding the rest of my narrow , little life for me .
i &apos;m going to the tavern , rumple .
what the hell ? !
hades was just here .
what &apos;s going on , rumple ?
congratulations , dearie .
i &apos;ve finally become the man you always wanted me to be .
the one who takes what he needs .
emma !
milah !
hades !
hades !
i tried to stop him .
he blew my magic right back at me .
milah ...
i couldn &apos;t stop it .
she &apos;s gone .
milah .
milah was here ?
milah ?
she helped us get to you .
hades has much to answer for .
indeed he does .
what was that ?
a horse ?
here ?
what &apos;s wrong with it ?
it &apos;s hurt .
it can &apos;t stand .
regina , your magic .
you did it .
i did .
regina , what are you doing ?
just checking .
i &apos;m back .
killian !
good job , mom .
oh , look at you .
i &apos;ll be all right .
how did you do it ?
gold got us in . he got us help .
he poofed us back here .
he even had a boat to get us all back home .
but it &apos;s gone .
what happened ?
hades attacked .
we lost the boat and ...
we lost a friend .
i hear you took away my sacrifice .
everything i did to save my friends
all went to give you back your power .
i should kill you .
acknowledged .
but ... you helped get me out of there ,
so i should say --
thank you . no need .
stay of execution .
we &apos;re even -- for now .
i just wanted to get home .
and yes , you &apos;re welcome , captain .
well , we &apos;re sorry you lost her .
she made me who i am .
okay , we don &apos;t have a way out ,
but we didn &apos;t have one before anyway .
my magic &apos;s working now .
so let &apos;s do this heart split .
that way , when we find an exit , we can get through it .
heart split ?
it &apos;s a good plan .
it &apos;ll work .
trust me .
do it .
what was that ?
interesting .
what the hell ?
what is this ?
why didn &apos;t it work ?
hades told me to pick three names
and chisel them onto the headstones .
he said whoever i picked would remain in the underworld .
i refused .
well , it looks like he did the picking himself .
what does this mean ?
it means we &apos;re stuck here ,
and now we can &apos;t use your heart to save hook .
well ...
i got the pirate out in a day .
but you lots managed to find a whole new way to fail .
i &apos;ll be in the shop .
peekaboo !
some places never change , even after all these years .
wouldn &apos;t hurt to dust the chickens .
i know who you are , dark one .
well , i imagine you do .
you weren &apos;t like this before .
that &apos;s right .
i was a mortal man then , and a moral one .
a man in a desperate situation .
and you took advantage , and i admire that a great deal .
full points .
but i don &apos;t like carrying debt .
unfortunately , dark one , the contract is binding .
even if i wanted to change it , i couldn &apos;t .
you owe me .
i owe you !
that &apos;s right , but ...
i can &apos;t owe a debt to a dead man .
now , i don &apos;t like debts .
but i do love a loophole .
oh , there you are .
i destroyed the boat .
now send me home .
thank you very much for that .
it means so much to me that you took care of it .
it shows passion .
was it terrible to do ?
i think you liked it .
stop fishing .
i won &apos;t tell you that i liked it , because i didn &apos;t .
not in any way that matters .
and i &apos;ll never do anything like that again .
wow , you really mean that .
i @-@ i &apos;m blown away .
well , i suppose you &apos;re ready to go home now .
i am .
good .
glad to hear it .
except ...
... things have changed .
no , no .
a gentleman always keeps his deals . you have to keep --
hey , i didn &apos;t say i wasn &apos;t keeping my deal .
sure , i &apos;ll send you home , just not today .
why , you ask ?
because you tried to hide something from me .
let &apos;s take a look at your belle .
so pretty .
i mean , i &apos;ve been watching her for hours ,
and she is simply darling .
you put this crystal ball together so well .
using the eyeball -- inspired .
and then , butterfingers , you dropped it .
insane , after all that work .
and i couldn &apos;t figure out
why an image of your wife would affect you so strongly .
so i did a little digging and a little thinking ,
and i realized
you weren &apos;t trying to conjure an image of her , were you ?
you were trying to figure out where your son went .
you asked the crystal ball
to show you your child , didn &apos;t you ?
so ...
no , no .
this is an image of your child --
your next child .
belle doesn &apos;t know it yet , but ... she &apos;s pregnant .
and guess what .
remember him ?
you two had a contract .
you tried to void it by killing him
during a certain potentially baby @-@ making liaison
with your protégé , the evil queen &apos;s mother , cora .
you rascal !
which seemed smart at the time ,
but it turns out death doesn &apos;t actually nullify a contract .
not down here .
because here he is .
and ...
... here &apos;s the contract .
which he just signed over to me .
so , just to be super extra clear ,
at any time ,
i can cash in the debt ...
and take your baby .
all magic comes with a price ...
and now , dark one , the price is ...
you work for me .
and there &apos;s something i need you to do ...
that only you can do .
