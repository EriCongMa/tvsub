you know how a computer is this big ?
what if a computer was ... this big ?
the size of a man &apos;s hand .
and it had a camera in it and you could take self pictures
and it also had a phone ?
so you could store it easily ...
it &apos;s kind of a good idea .
draw it up by noon .
quit bossing me around .
this makes me impatient
and it makes me also so furious ...
i need 45 minutes away from you ,
and then we can be best friends again .
don &apos;t follow me out .
今日
so , as you guys know , schmidt and i are business partners .
we &apos;ve been working on an idea we &apos;re very excited about .
we e @-@ mailed our plans to a guy in china ,
and the prototype is here .
and ... we &apos;ve got a pitch meeting set up
with lori greiner .
from qvc ?
that the one .
that &apos;s right .
you know , fawn and i were paired with her
in a charity golf tournament .
you know , they laughed at me for playing the ladies &apos; tees ,
but it paid off .
she &apos;s a shark .
a shark golfing .
now i &apos;d buy that t @-@ shirt .
friends , imagine yourself in this scenario .
you &apos;re at the local gymnasia .
you &apos;re schvitzing up a storm .
suddenly , you get a text message .
there &apos;s an emergency wedding down at the town hall .
but what &apos;ll i wear ? i mean , i &apos;m sweating at the gym .
huh , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . i love this .
ladies and gentlemen ,
may i present to you ...
game time .
the swuit !
the swuit !
the swuit !
the swuit !
it &apos;s a suit made entirely of sweat suit material .
well ?
this is it ?
what do you guys think ?
this looks like garbage . it looks like garbage .
i don &apos;t think it looks like ... relax .
nick , it looks like garb ...
it &apos;s embarrassing . put it away .
the bottoms aren &apos;t great , but the top ...
well , i like it .
i mean , i like you guys .
all right , i &apos;m gonna go throw this out .
no , don &apos;t throw it away !
why , you want to wear it ?
no .
no , no , no , no .
no .
he said , &quot; do you want to wear it ? &quot;
no , i just ...
i think ... i was gonna put it
in the goodwill bin at school .
as lining for the bottom .
get rid of it . it &apos;s a piece of crap .
we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re screwed .
guys , you &apos;re starting a business .
there are gonna be some setbacks .
we don &apos;t have enough time , okay ?
i &apos;m running out of vacation days ,
and our pitch meeting with lori is on friday .
friday ? !
you never told me friday .
he never told ...
i told you a hundred times it was on friday .
guys ...
that sounds like it could be right , yeah .
could be friday . yeah .
now we need another good idea in four days .
ah , i can &apos;t work under pressure like this .
you know that i get nervous .
i am just a man . i am not a god .
uh , i think we &apos;re all aware of that .
why you talking like that ?
like what ?
well , we &apos;re all aware of that .
guys , stop fighting !
you &apos;re upsetting winston .
it &apos;s so early .
you made me swallow my night guard .
oh , please , it &apos;s a paperclip with gum wrapped around it .
we &apos;re in a crunch .
good morning !
made you guys some brain food .
ah , thank you .
i &apos;m supposed to hang out with kai later
and do nothing . this &apos;ll help .
no time . the pitch is on friday .
i &apos;m gonna need one good idea
every 20 seconds .
oh , you &apos;re gonna time me now ?
yes .
it &apos;ll help you concentrate .
it &apos;s too beepy @-@ boppy .
well , it &apos;s brain music .
go .
look away .
this is exciting .
i feel like i &apos;m in the garage at cupertino .
乔布斯和合伙人也是在车库里发家的
this sounds like the video in middle school
that taught me about periods .
and time !
all right .
let &apos;s see what you got .
&quot; i am the karduthian champion of ... of dance . &quot;
&quot; beer bread . &quot;
beard bread .
bread that is in your beard .
that &apos;s an ... that &apos;s an invention ?
or is that just something that happens to you ?
you think hewlett had to put up with this crap
from packard ? again .
oh , now i &apos;m packard ? enough !
you can &apos;t come up with a good idea being all loosey @-@ goosey .
why don &apos;t you tell that to howard hughes ,
是个将神话与怪异集结一身的天才人物
the inventor of the loose goose ?
that was the spruce goose , and it didn &apos;t work !
it did work !
it flew for over a mile at an altitude of 72 feet !
how on earth do you know that information
and not know the name of it ?
i don &apos;t want to stick my nose in someone else &apos;s rose ,
but what i &apos;m hearing
is two very passionate partners
with two totally different approaches .
you hit the nail right on the head !
that is a correct assessment
of what is going on right now .
and thank you for breakfast !
i &apos;m gonna shove this bacon right in my mouth
and savor it for life .
that omelette was so delicious !
you know what , you guys are saying really nice things to me ,
but you &apos;re both shouting ...
such a delicious omelette !
the presentation &apos;s fantastic !
one of the most delicious things i &apos;ve ever had .
you &apos;ve outdone yourself .
definitely appreciated !
don &apos;t follow me .
don &apos;t follow me !
all they care about is who &apos;s the boss .
of course that &apos;s all they care about , jess .
it &apos;s a guy thing . it &apos;s in our dna .
look , nick &apos;s not gonna let schmidt boss him around ,
and vice versa .
don &apos;t get me started on the male power dynamic .
i will talk your ear off .
they &apos;re being such dudes right now .
it &apos;s , like , all about
who &apos;s got the bigger you @-@ know @-@ what .
oh , i do know what .
what can we do to make them collaborate ?
you can eliminate their you @-@ know @-@ whats .
that was a joke .
you want to hang out tonight and have ninja turtle sex ?
what &apos;s ninja turtle sex ?
sex with backpacks on .
oh , sex with backpacks on !
yes , i would love to , but i can &apos;t .
i got to do some work , or schmidt will put me
in the &quot; think harder &quot; box ,
which is basically just a refrigerator box
that he hits with a baseball bat .
gets me to think harder .
talk later ?
yeah .
great .
i really hope that you enjoyed your service today ,
and please come back ...
okay .
thanks a lot , big spender .
you should probably show some clavicle .
no . i need bigger tips .
they &apos;re raising my college tuition ,
and if i don &apos;t come up with the money by friday ,
i got to drop out .
so i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do .
wow , cece , look .
i mean , we &apos;re your friends .
if you want , i can give you money .
you can give her money .
i ain &apos;t giving her a damn thing ...
i think what coach is trying to say
is that he will also give you money .
look , that &apos;s very sweet ,
but the last thing i want is charity , okay ?
and don &apos;t tell jess , because she just
goes nuts anytime she thinks i need money .
so i don &apos;t think i can afford to go home for my aunt &apos;s birthday .
you need money ? i &apos;m selling my hair !
oh ! hi . hello !
you &apos;re a handsome fella .
can i interest you in a drink or ...
oh , you suck !
we got to do something .
winston , for the first time in my life ,
i &apos;m not 100 % broke ,
and you want me to give my money away ?
no , sir .
she said she didn &apos;t want charity .
i ain &apos;t giving it to her .
oh , crap .
am i stuck doing another thing with you again ?
it &apos;s a classic winston and coach mess @-@ around !
all right . but don &apos;t say that .
what if i put your name first ?
let me hear it .
it &apos;s a classic
coach and winston mess @-@ around .
regardless , i don &apos;t like it .
oh , okay .
hey , schmidt .
so i noticed you &apos;re having trouble working with nick .
well , you know what , he &apos;s got a real head
full of dog dirt .
so i noticed you &apos;re having trouble working with schmidt .
he &apos;s a bossy old tuna .
well , we both know you are the boss .
thank you .
but we both know he &apos;s not the boss .
exactly .
maybe you could back off a little ,
since nick &apos;s been having , you know ,
man problems .
&quot; man problems &quot; ?
man problems .
are we talking clog or leak ?
he &apos;s got the wet tuesdays ?
you think it &apos;s &apos; cause of his tight denim pants ?
did the squirrels get to the tulip bulbs ?
and that &apos;s why you have to make him
feel like he &apos;s the boss right now .
yeah , of course . it &apos;s the least that i could do .
well , i had no idea schmidt had a cranky dank .
so , yeah , i &apos;ll let him be the boss .
i &apos;m amazing .
what ?
i &apos;m amazing .
what ?
what ?
what ?
this is a bit of an unprecedented group ,
the three of us .
this isn &apos;t a social call , young lady .
oh . this is strictly business .
here &apos;s the deal .
you need money for college .
no . no , okay ?
i am not a charity case .
this isn &apos;t charity .
no . no , we &apos;ve gone through this .
this is an investment .
nick and schmidt are looking for investors ,
so we thought it would be fun if we got into investing , too .
you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re driven .
we are confident in a very robust roi .
roi means &quot; return on investment . &quot;
i know what it stands for .
i &apos;ve been reading a lot
of schmidt &apos;s investment books in the toilet .
lifehack , the toilet paper makes for
a very , very handy bookmark .
lifehack , read your phone
on the toilet like everybody else .
the answer is gonna be no , all right ?
because when you borrow money from friends ,
things get weird ...
n @-@ n @-@ no , do not mistake this
for friendship , young lady , all right ?
as far as i &apos;m concerned , you &apos;re just a walking treasury bond .
within three years of graduation ,
you will pay us back in full ,
plus ten percent of the principal .
i really don &apos;t want to do this . at all .
but ...
there &apos;s always a &quot; but , &quot; huh ?
but i don &apos;t really have any other choice .
yes !
you were right , man .
so i guess we &apos;re in business , boys .
yes .
we wrote the check out to cece .
we do not know your full name .
this is looking really good .
it &apos;s absolutely stunning .
this is ... this is your vision from start to finish .
i might be the seed , but you &apos;re the farmer .
hey , you two look like you &apos;re really getting along .
yeah , well , you know what , who wouldn &apos;t get along
with this brave , masculine , healthy cowboy ?
what you got there ?
it &apos;s a camera attachment .
that keeps the attention of your dog
while you &apos;re taking its picture .
oh . schmidt came up with a great title for it .
it &apos;s called &quot; perfect pet pic . &quot;
this is just a prototype that dumb @-@ old me came up with .
if he put it together , it &apos;d be a lot better , i promise you that .
now , of course , could @-@ could you just hold some pet food
in your other hand ? sure .
but this is a lifestyle product .
that &apos;s actually really impressive .
i think lori &apos;s gonna like that .
you know , i had a vision of what this product would look like .
and you carried it out and exceeded my expectations
in a way that ... i don &apos;t know .
it @-@ it &apos;s touching .
sometimes i feel like you &apos;re my arms .
i &apos;m really proud of the way that you &apos;re handling this .
i &apos;m proud of the way that you &apos;ve handled this .
what have i handled ?
y @-@ your man problems .
no , honey , you &apos;re the one with the man problems .
i don &apos;t have the man problems . i &apos;m being so nice to you
because you &apos;re the one who has the man problems .
no , no , no , sweetheart , i &apos;m only being nice to you
&apos;cause you have man problems , and i feel sorry ...
no , you have man problems
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m being nice to you right now .
honey , honey , honey ...
what man problems did you think i had ?
something hangy .
hang ... ? you think i had something hanging off ...
what &apos;d you think i had ? !
i don &apos;t want to get too graphic ,
but i ... i was picturing something gooey .
gooey &apos;s not the worst-- i &apos;ve had gooey .
oh , good god , what ?
simply ignore it .
who told you about my man problems ?
who told you about my man ... ?
look , the only reason why i did this
was to get you guys to stop arguing about who &apos;s the boss ...
don &apos;t you be sorry !
jess , you did nothing wrong !
you &apos;re nothing but an angel !
you tried to help us , which is a sweet move !
you tried to help a situation ...
you &apos;re yelling nice things at me again !
... which was at a boiling point .
it &apos;s very confusing !
this is his fault !
he &apos;s been bossing me around for ten years !
if i hadn &apos;t been bossing you around ,
you would just be a bartender with a lot of ideas
and the ambition of a dead person .
i will never let you boss me around again .
not even if the lives of 100,000 children depended on it .
fine , if @-@ if ... i take that part back .
if a bunch of kids &apos; lives depended on it ,
i &apos;d let you boss me around .
you went way too far
in that moment .
fine , but you understand my point .
if there were five kids whose life
depended on it ,
i wouldn ...
not even five kids .
okay , i ... no kids , i don &apos;t ...
pretend i ...
just take the kids out .
i understand the point you &apos;re trying to make !
the company is dead ! that &apos;s the point .
i &apos;m going to that pitch meeting tomorrow
with lori greiner without you .
you know why ?
because a boss never breaks appointments .
you think i was born in the middle of the afternoon ?
you &apos;re gonna go into that pitch and take all the credit ?
fine , go to that pitch together , and then me and you , we &apos;re done .
fine , i &apos;m done with you .
don &apos;t speak to me until bedtime .
if you think we &apos;re gonna have a bedtime chat ,
you &apos;re out of your mind .
we &apos;ll lay in beds , and we &apos;ll just over the day together
like we usually do and that &apos;s it !
no .
fine , we &apos;ll do that for a little bit . that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s it .
here , take it . i don &apos;t even need it anymore .
bedtime chat &apos;s gonna be so short , you won &apos;t believe it .
oh , i &apos;ll believe it .
you won &apos;t believe it .
thought you might not show .
i drove you here , nicholas .
let &apos;s just get through this thing ,
and then we can be done with each other , okay ?
okay .
and , by the way , stay out of my way in there .
i &apos;m about to blow the roof off of this thing
with a little something i like to call the &quot; seven s &apos;s . &quot;
i bet you don &apos;t have any more than four .
yeah ? watch me .
go ahead .
strategy , sizzle , schmidt ,
sex ...
go on .
stop interrupting me . i got ... i got more .
salesmanship .
something .
synergy .
boom . nailed it .
damn it .
that &apos;s seven-- how you like me now ?
all right , that &apos;s really good , but it &apos;s not gonna matter ,
&apos;cause the only thing that matters is what i have .
a prototype .
so stay out of my way in there ,
and let me just show her the prototype ,
because that &apos;s all we need .
we don &apos;t need a prototype .
did you forget the prototype ?
no .
did you forget the prototype ?
no .
did you forget the prototype ?
yeah .
where &apos;d you leave it , nick ?
i still believe in them though .
part of me thinks that even though
they &apos;re mad at each other , they &apos;ll get in there ,
and they &apos;ll figure it out .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case .
why are you being so negative ?
&apos;cause they left their stupid thing .
what ? !
oh , crap .
♪ i &apos;m delivering a prototype ♪
♪ and drinking a big coffee ... ♪
oh , crap .
nick , what is the matter with you ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t have forgot it if you didn &apos;t bully me
to get out of the house an hour early !
it was too fast ! i needed time !
you lay on the ground ... !
you guys ready ?
yeah .
yes , of course .
absolutely .
i &apos;m talking about postwar .
that &apos;s after the war .
prewar would be something different completely .
i was in london postwar , post @-@ postwar ,
in &apos; 77 , and , uh ...
i caught a few shows .
the flights were ...
well , i think i spent two ... maybe $ 250 to get to ...
guess who ?
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m just checking in on my investment .
oh , my ...
hey , check it out .
i &apos;m a campus cutie .
no , you are not .
what are we learning ?
i am studying
postwar british art history .
what ? post br @-@ british who ? what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s just a bunch of words that mean
&quot; screw you , investors . &quot; what else you taking ?
intro to afrikaans .
what else ? astronomy 101 ?
that &apos;s next semester .
what you gonna do , cece ,
join the south african space program
and be the first woman
to put a david hockney painting on the moon ?
who is david hockney ?
excuse me , can i help you ?
no , no , we &apos;re okay , sorry .
yes , can you please , um ,
tell my investment here
we &apos;re okay , we &apos;re ...
that she can &apos;t make any money with art history .
that &apos;s not true .
last year i made almost $ 22,000,
and my life is very hard .
you see that ? you should be studying to become a doctor .
they make good money , they get respect .
paging dr. cece .
a doctor ? we wouldn &apos;t see a penny
for at least 12 years .
here &apos;s what you should be focused on , okay ?
something with a low risk ,
high reward , and that thing ...
do not say hotel management .
hotel management .
oh , my gosh .
look , man , it is a secure living
and it &apos;s great way to meet people .
do you mind ...
telling me where i might find more information
on hotel management ?
uh , the dog , uh ... the dog ...
you put the food in the thing .
uh , and then the dog sees it ,
and , uh , the food &apos;s dangle @-@ dang ...
uh , it &apos;s dangling .
to , uh , do @-@ do @-@ do ...
dog ...
looks at dang @-@ dang .
tail wag @-@ wag , uh , rev ...
dog wagging the ta ...
um , whatever dog &apos;s name is .
dog &apos;s name is claire .
claire come in .

shh .
uh , claire sees dog food .
pic , facebook , like , like , like ...
sizzle ...
pet pic ...
strategy , sex , something .
strategy , sex , something .
s @-@ something .
something .
this is the worst pitch i have ever seen .
sorry . sorry to interrupt .
gentlemen , your prototype .
wait , what are you wearing ?
this ?
this is the swuit !
it &apos;s a suit
made entirely of sweat suit material .
it was invented by nick and schmidt ,
and like them , it &apos;s the perfect combination .
that one over there ,
he &apos;s all creativity and ideas .
thoughts and notions .
and this one &apos;s all data and numbers .
six .
he can just keep going .
the swuit goes from day to night and night to play .
take my friend nick here for example .
i mean , this is a man who would wear sweatpants to his wedding .
i now pronounce me comfortable .
look , lori , you get it .
look , lori , you get it .
lori , you get it .
do it together .
no one doesn &apos;t love the swuit .
don &apos;t settle for substitutes .
swettle for swub @-@ si @-@ swuits .
no ?
i &apos;ve got to stop drinking on the golf course .
to the swuit !
the swuit !
hey , how &apos;d it go ?
she like the perfect pet pic ?
even better .
she hated the swuit .
yeah , she &apos;s got a similar product on qvc
called the scruit .
it &apos;s a suit made of scrubs .
it was developed for prison weddings .
yeah , paid us $ 10,000 to kill the swuit .
yeah !
yeah !
so , nick , are you finally free to do nothing ?
not so fast there , lady .
uh , old schmidty @-@ bangs and i
have to get working on our next idea .
that is , if you &apos;ll still have me , buddy .
come on , man .
of course i &apos;ll have you .
look at me .
look at me .
i was looking at you the whole time .
don &apos;t say anything .
when i say that , just let me say that
and take a moment where you &apos;re like ,
&quot; wow , he &apos;s about to say something . &quot;
you kept ... you kept saying it as if i wasn &apos;t looking at you .
but what i &apos;m clearly doing
is saying , &quot; look at me . &quot;
and what you &apos;re supposed to do is be like , &quot; ah . &quot;
and then i &apos;m gonna say something .

nick miller ,
friend , businessman .
this one &apos;s for you .

i think she &apos;s making herself some tea .
what &apos;s up ? are you okay ?
kai broke up with me .
no .
i &apos;m sorry , dude .
i &apos;m sorry . what happened ?
she said she wants to be
with somebody who can just sit on the couch all day .
she said i &apos;m too ambitious , she said i work too hard .
nah , it was the ... it &apos;s not funny .
it &apos;s just that when you said that out loud , it made me laugh .
i &apos;m really sorry about kai .
she seemed like a great girl , but on the bright side ,
in all your years on this planet ,
has anyone ever dumped you for working too hard ?
no .
no , it &apos;s mostly &apos; cause i &apos;m either too poor or too sticky .
so this is a big day then .
for the first time in my life ,
i really want to do something with this , you know ?
i really want to make this business work .
schmidt , tomorrow , let &apos;s start bright and early , 7 : 00 a.m.

winston and coach gave it to me .
they &apos;re helping me with money for my tuition .
