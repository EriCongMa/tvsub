okay . i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll get that .
hello ?
hey , manny &apos;s getting his outfit together
for the dance tonight .
i was just taking some supplies out to the car .
isn &apos;t this exciting -- the boys &apos; first dance ?
greatest day of my life .
does phil have a green pocket square for him ?
teal !
teal .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t think phil &apos;s
really a pocket @-@ square kind of a guy .
why don &apos;t we conference in mitch ?
ay ! look . this might work .
well , except that it &apos;s turquoise ...
oh , and a bra ? !
do you think the kids in my village had pocket squares ?
here we go with the village .
dad , are you still there ?
unfortunately , yes .
please ask claire what time
do i need to be at the school to help set up .
gloria wants to know --
no , i heard . i heard .
um , tell her thank you so much ,
but we have all the help we could possibly need ,
and she doesn &apos;t even have to come tonight
if she doesn &apos;t want to . - claire said --
i heard .
hello ?
oh , hey , mitch !
where are you ?
oh , we &apos;re at the park .
you would not believe
how some of these people dress their kids .
lily &apos;s friend just pulled a britney spears
getting out of a sandbox car .
so , dad &apos;s on the line .
do you he a teal pocket square for manny ?
cam , manny needs a teal pocket square .
oh , i &apos;ve got teal , i &apos;ve got aqua , i &apos;ve got sea foam ...
yeah , cam &apos;s got one .
cam &apos;s got one .
yes !
oh , you know what ? i lent it to andre .
ah . he lent it to andre .
flag on the play .
what &apos;s that mean ?
what &apos;s that mean ? !
now i got to go to the mall .
is this okay ?
oh , hey ! luke has to go to the mall , too .
what ?
phil .
let &apos;s go , incredible hulk .
uh , is that ur little girl over there -- lily ?
yes . look at her .
yes .
uh , well , this is a little bit awkward ,
but she bit tyler .
oh , no .
oh , my goodness .
i -- i don &apos;t even know what to say .
she &apos;s never done anything like that before .
how did it happen ?
i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t see .
it &apos;s time to play everyone &apos;s favorite game .
&quot; let &apos;s blame the gay dads &quot; !
you know who had straight parents ?
adolf hitler .
charles manson .
shall we go on ?
naomi campbell .
i @-@ i know it happened .
he &apos;s got bite marks on his arm .
oh , gosh , someone really sunk their teeth into you , huh ?
it &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re such a yummy little guy !
yes !
our daughter didn &apos;t do that .
but he said -- - right .
he &apos;s probably just confused .
you know who i bet did it , though ?
billy . rhymes with lily .
plus , he is very aggressive .
his babysitter &apos;s right over there .
she &apos;s -- she &apos;s not much of a disciplinarian .
because i can assure you ,
if our child did something like this ,
we would be on her like white on rice .
and i know that sounds a little bit like a racial slur ,
because we &apos;re white and she presumably likes rice ,
but i didn &apos;t intend it that way .
ah . finally . there &apos;s a spot .
guys , i am just bursting with pride right now .
your first dance .
soon you &apos;re gonna be men .
i want you to know there &apos;s more to be a man
than just shopping for fancy outfits .
yep . pretty soon , you get some hair on your chest ,
you start answering the phone ,
people don &apos;t think you &apos;re ladies .
come on , today , miss daisy .
actually , miss daisy was the one being driven ,
not the one driving .
never saw it .
it &apos;s called &quot; driving miss daisy . &quot;
you got a real lip on you today . you know that ?
hey ! that was our spot !
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re gonna let him snake your spot ?
not worth it .
boys , here &apos;s the only thing you got to know
about being a man --
never let someone take what is yours .
unless it &apos;s just a parking spot
and there &apos;s plenty of others .
that &apos;s sweet , phil . you ought to write that down .
you got any lipstick in your purse ?
i love jay . are you kidding me ?
he &apos;s my boy .
yeah , he gives me a hard time ,
but that &apos;s the deal with a father @-@ in @-@ law .
the key is ,
i never let him see just how much it devastates me .
it &apos;s &quot; dunphy . &quot;
that &apos;s what i said -- &quot; dumphy . &quot;
no , not &quot; dumb . &quot;
&quot; dunphy . &quot;
&quot; dumphy . &quot;
say &quot; done . &quot;
done .
say &quot; fee . &quot;
fee .
&quot; done @-@ fee . &quot;
&quot; dumphy . &quot;
all right , just bring it this way ?
this way -- there it is .
perfect . thank you . perfect .
cla @-@ a @-@ aire ?
what ?
can you ask gus to fix that light ?
i asked him , but he just growled at me .
oh , gosh . okay .
gus , stop scaring bethenny and fix the light , please ?
don &apos;t make me come over there .
i &apos;m busy . you fix it .
is this because i said
i wouldn &apos;t come to the dance with you ?
gus , i &apos;m a married woman . people would talk .
one dance with me , you &apos;d forget all about him .
yeah , i already have a husband who doesn &apos;t fix lights .
please ?
thank you so much .
this school would literally fall apart without you .
well , i don &apos;t know about &quot; literally , &quot; but ...
ihola , hola ! i &apos;m here !
oh , you came anyway .
that &apos;s great .
i think it &apos;s great , too .
a few weeks ago , they asked for someone
to be in charge of the school dance ,
and i volunteered .
the school asks for volunteers
so that everybody will feel included ,
but who are they kidding ?
they want me to do it .
i &apos;ve put on every school dance since haley was 12 .
it &apos;s my thing .
they made us co @-@ chairs ,
which means we &apos;re supposed to do everything together ,
but claire won &apos;t take any of my ideas .
she suggested an &quot; arabian nights &quot; theme .
isn &apos;t it a little soon ?
okay . um , hey , everybody ?
do you know gloria , manny &apos;s mom ?
she &apos;s here to help us out today .
i &apos;m the co @-@ chair .
so , the kids are gonna be here in two hours ,
so everybody back to work .
everybody back to work .
i just said that .
and i just co @-@ said it .
i mean , the nerve of that lady accusing lily ?
mm . well , you know what ? you can &apos;t change people , cam .
i mean , we just have to rise above .
what happened ?
she bit me .
are you serious ?
ohh ! ah ! she did it again !
it &apos;s like &quot; twilight &quot; back here !
no ! no ice cream for you , billy ,
because the lady say you biting !
okay . okay . go . go .
yeah .
go , go , go .
drive .
are you sure this is teal ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m starting to get a real strong green thing here .
that &apos;s the fluorescent lights .
do you mind if i walk this over to lamps galore ?
i need you to worry about this less .
guess who fit into the suit on the mannequin
and saved us 20 % ?
here &apos;s something i didn &apos;t know about mannequins --
they don &apos;t have a wiener .
what the heck is that ?
it &apos;s a nicer word for &quot; penis . &quot;
no , i mean , what the heck is this ?
it &apos;s a tie .
it &apos;s teal .
i don &apos;t care .
i just grabbed the first one i saw .
well , grab a different one .
no !
now i like it .
uh , i think we were here first .
i just have one thing . i &apos;m in a big rush .
so are we .
that &apos;s fine . go ahead .
seriously ?
jay , it &apos;s not a big deal .
and can you give me the sale prices
for some things i bought last week ?
oh , for god &apos;s sake !
now , this is what i &apos;m talking about , boys .
you give people an inch , they &apos;ll run all over you .
or you could just be nice -- pay it forward .
they don &apos;t make movies out of bad ideas .
all i know is you got to fight for what you want .
if there &apos;s one job available ,
this guy just got it ,
and they go hungry at the &quot; dumphys &apos; . &quot;
&quot; dunphys &apos; . &quot;
okay , i don &apos;t get it . why is she biting ?
lily , why are you biting ?
she &apos;s not biting . she &apos;s teething .
on people !
all right , if she starts biting her play dates ,
she &apos;s gonna be a pariah .
try &quot; piranha . &quot;
really , cam ?
it was right there .
all right , you should also know that i in no way --
in no way -- blame you .
well , thank you . why would you blame me ?
i don &apos;t .
well , good , because i don &apos;t blame you .
well , obviously .
uh , okay , well , now i &apos;m starting to feel the blame .
no . no . don &apos;t -- it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s just that you &apos;re with her all day .
i have a daughter who bites and a partner who stings .
okay . okay , you want to know the truth ?
sometimes you &apos;ve sent her some mixed signals .
i &apos;m gonna bite your feet !
i &apos;m gonna bite &apos; em right off !
oh , i &apos;m not the one who uses my teeth like a multi @-@ tool .
here we go . cookies for lily ...
... and wine for us .
okay .
i can &apos;t believe you would equate --
oh , don &apos;t bite my head off .
i &apos;m not a pack of batteries .
un poquito mas aca . es perfecto all .
ay , good . bellissimo .
why is this box here ? !
i am sorry -- we did ,
because we were moving the tables .
well , why are you moving the tables ?
so the kids have more space to dance .
it &apos;s better this way .
is it really , gloria ?
because right now it kind of just looks like
a clump of tables and a big open space .
look , i &apos;m sorry ,
but we &apos;ve always done it this way ,
and i think it &apos;s gonna throw people off
if you move them around .
oh , my god , these tables look great !
who did this ?
i did !
i love it !
hello .
we haven &apos;t been properly introduced .
i &apos;m gloria .
i &apos;m bethenny .
i don &apos;t know if anybody &apos;s ever told you this ,
but you &apos;re really pretty .
no . no , bethenny . no one &apos;s ever told her that .
i am seriously freaking out
about these tables !
you know what ? let &apos;s just put a pin in
where we &apos;re gonna put the tables .
yes , we &apos;re keeping the tables !
so what else can i do ?
um ... you can ...
help me with the chairs .
okay .
we need a lot of them .
they &apos;re under the stage right ... here .
there you go .
it &apos;s like dirty and dark there , no ?
yeah , i know . bummer , right ?
off you go .
smells funny , claire !
so sorry . keep goin &apos; !
what ?
we needed chairs .
what are you guys talking about ?
no , nothing . he was just saying
how much he loves the tables .
if i had the receipt ,
i wouldn &apos;t need you to look it up .
at this rate , i &apos;m going to miss the first dance ...
at my wedding !
i thought he only had one item .
tell your dad , if it were up to me ,
we &apos;d have been in and out of here in about 10 minutes .
you mentioned that .
and i &apos;ll probably mention it again ,
because , thanks to someone ,
we &apos;re gonna be here for a while .
yeah , i get it .
you know , luke , you should order that suit in a larger size ,
because by the time we get out of here
i ... get ... it .
pay for the suit .
where the hell are you going ?
luke needs ... socks .
make &apos; em teal !
you &apos;re playing a very dangerous game .
hey , boys ...
look who it is --
the guy that stole our parking spot .
are you going to hit him ?
i &apos;d totally hit him .
i &apos;m not gonna hit him ,
but i &apos;m gonna give him a piece of my mind .
now , boys , pay attention -- you want to be men ,
this is how you handle a jerk like this .
hey , chief ?
you know , you stole our parking space today .
what ?
that &apos;s right .
i was waiting for the parking space ,
you sneaked right in there --
that make you feel like a big man ?
did i ? i didn &apos;t even notice .
that &apos;s no excuse .
i &apos;m really sorry .
my dog died today .
i had to put him to sleep .
14 years ,
he was all i had .
now i can &apos;t stand the thought
of going back to my empty apartment ,
so i just keep wandering around the mall .
you know what ? forget about the ...
spot .
oh , god !
that was his name !
do not hit him .
oasis for men ?
that &apos;s funny .
you made that sound like a question ,
then you didn &apos;t wait for me to answer .
what ?
here , let me show you .
yeah , yeah , yeah . you go --
you go , &quot; oasis for men &quot; ?
you see what i mean ? you went , &quot; oasis for men &quot; ?
you should have said , &quot; oasis for men &quot; ?
then i &apos;d go , &quot; yeah , give me two . &quot;
but instead , you went , &quot; oasis for men . &quot;
okay . i get it .
you see what i mean ?
i @-@ i get it . i get it .
no , i &apos;m not sure you do !
you sprayed before &quot; men &quot; !
you went , &quot; oasis for men . &quot;
okay . okay .
men !
men ! men !
stop it ! stop it !
men ! men ! men ! men !
stop it !
men ! men ! men ! men !
stop it !
men ! men ! men ! men ! men !
hey , phil .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
i just ...
i ...
i don &apos;t know what happened .
look , i might &apos;ve come down on you a little bit hard today .
i &apos;m sorry .
i remember pretending to go look for some socks ...
i mean , it &apos;s , uh , my fault .
i pushed your buttons .
my father @-@ in @-@ law was the same way with me .
he was horrible .
grandpa lucas ? he was a sweetheart .
yeah , after the stroke mellowed him out good .
before ? an animal .
we named luke after him .
everything i did was wrong .
if i said it was white , he &apos;d say it was black .
although he never said anything was black
&apos;cause he was a pretty big racist .
i wear his watch .
i hated him . hated him .
and i was thinking -- i don &apos;t know --
i don &apos;t want you to think the same way about me .
you ever think about maybe
not being a jerk to me so much ?
now , see , you got to stop taking that stuff personally .
i &apos;m like that with everybody .
i &apos;m tough !
and ... mean .
i don &apos;t like to take guff !
or people &apos;s feelings into consideration .
okay , okay .
i can &apos;t swear my way &apos;s the right way .
i see you smiling , skipping around ,
and i think sometimes -- i don &apos;t know --
maybe the boys would be better off
if they were a little bit more like you .
you know , skipping burns more calories than running .
that &apos;s --
we &apos;re done here .
oh , hey , listen .
he didn &apos;t tell me , but what &apos;d you do to that guy , huh ?
did you get him ?
yeah , i sprayed him with cologne .
i &apos;m sorry i asked .
no , but , like , a lot of cologne .
i just , like , got way up in there .
good boy .
did you find anything yet ?
yes , there &apos;s a whole section on biting
on this mommy forum .
oh , good . what does it say ?
uh , &quot; my son was biting ,
so i got a stranger to yell at him . &quot;
&quot; being disciplined by someone else outside the family
scared him into stopping . &quot;
idiots !
cam !
what ? i am not hiring some hobo
to come over here and traumatize my child .
she &apos;s already prone to flashbacks ,
if you know what i mean .
yeah , you know she didn &apos;t fight in vietnam , right ?
i don &apos;t know anything anymore .
what else does it say ?
okay , well , this one says ,
&quot; when my daughter bit her brother ,
i put a pinch of pepper in her mouth . &quot;
&quot; she cried and cried , but she never bit again . &quot;
smiley face .
oh , well , the smiley face makes it okay .
&quot; i waterboarded our toddler --
lol &quot; !
well , all right , what do you suggest we do ?
that we log off the spanish inquisition website
and handle this with love .
okay , lily ...
take a bite of an apple , take a bite of a pear
take a bite of the cookie that you left over there
here &apos;s one thing you should never do .
don &apos;t bite taylor or brandon or sue
because people aren &apos;t food . people aren &apos;t food
your friends will run away
if they &apos;re scared of being chewed
and as a side note ,
private parts are private
well ... problem solved .
i know you &apos;re being sarcastic ,
but you don &apos;t know that it &apos;s not .
ow ! honey .
did she just bite you again ?
no .
that is it . i am getting the pepper !
n -- no , you are not .
cam , you &apos;re not doing her any favors by being soft .
oh , well , then , why don &apos;t you just skip the pepper ,
i &apos;ll get some pliers , and we &apos;ll pull her teeth now !
play relax ! it &apos;s a seasoning .
okay . well , then , why don &apos;t you try some ?
stop .
no . try a little .
stop it . stop it , cam . stop it .
no , try a little bit .
don &apos;t you hit me . here . put some in there .
no ! well ...
ow ! you bit me ! mm !
why don &apos;t you sing me a song about it ?
oh , look at you two in your matching ties !
don &apos;t get me started .
ohh , come here .
luke , sweetie , aryou wearing cologne ?
no . dad attacked the perfume guy
and then hugged me .
i saw the boys in those adorable little suits ,
and it made me realize this dance is about them .
it &apos;s not about me
and my petty little competition with ...
with gloria .
just look at the walls in here .
who wears that to a kids &apos; dance ?
i know . she looks amazing .
okay , i &apos;m gonna slow things down
with a blast from the past
for our chaperones .
oh , my god .
no , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
i need a paper towel .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t see you .
no ...
of course you didn &apos;t . of course you didn &apos;t .
&apos;cause it &apos;s gloria &apos;s night .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s all about gloria , gloria , gloria !
when you &apos;re done getting married ...
maybe you can mop this up a little .
what was that ?
it &apos;s this damn uniform .
okay , we need to talk .
no . i am fine . i do not need to talk .
well , you &apos;ve been pushing me away the whole week .
you &apos;ve been fighting all my ideas .
that &apos;s because this is my thing , gloria .
why can &apos;t it be my thing , too , claire ?
because everything is your thing !
this -- this is the one thing that was my thing .
this is my only thing .
oh my god , this is my only thing .
and then you come along and you steal my thunder
with your tight dresses and your great ideas .
i was the one that all the moms looked up to .
i was the only one that gus liked .
ay ! please .
you like him so much , you can keep him .
it &apos;s not the same now that i know he likes you .
that sounds really insane ,
but this isn &apos;t actually about gus .
really ? because you &apos;ve been talking a lot about him .
gloria , gus is a symbol .
a sex symbol ?
stop it , gloria . i &apos;m already crying .
claire ... i didn &apos;t come here to steal your thunder .
your thunder is your thunder ,
and my thunder is my thunder .
i know . it &apos;s just that god gave you so much thunder .
yeah , maybe too much .
i hate how those women look at me .
you think i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re thinking ?
&quot; ah , here comes the hot one with the big boobies
that is gonna steal my husband . &quot;
and maybe they don &apos;t let their kids play with manny .
i volunteer because i want them to see
that there &apos;s so much more to me .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
maybe for the same reason you didn &apos;t tell me
you had a weird thing for gus --
it &apos;s embarrassing .
okay . i am sorry .
i made this whole thing
into some ridiculous competition ,
and ... i &apos;m pathetic .
you &apos;re not pathetic .
okay , that &apos;s a little bit sad .
we like to think we &apos;re so smart
and we have all the answers .
and we want to pass all that on to our children .
but ...
if you scratch beneath the surface ,
you don &apos;t have to dig very deep to find the kid you were .
which is why it &apos;s kind of crazy
that now we &apos;re raising kids of our own .
you know what ? this is a milestone .
we &apos;re accepting that our little angel isn &apos;t perfect .
that &apos;s right . and it &apos;s okay .
i @-@ i take it back --
she is perfect .
but i guess that &apos;s the real circle of life .
your parents faked their way through it ,
you fake your way through it ,
and , hopefully ,
you don &apos;t raise a serial killer .
that &apos;s not funny .
i am so sorry .
no , just come over watching movie
put the whole thing behind you .
okay , see you in a bit .
that was longines . he &apos;s in a very bad place .
oh , no . what happened ?
well , apparently some maniac went crazy at the mall
and attacked him with oasis for men .
oh . well , i think we all knew that day was coming .
all right . wish me luck .
good luck .
okay , honey .
please don &apos;t hurt daddy .
all right .
