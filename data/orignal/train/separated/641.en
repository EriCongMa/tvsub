I'm in possession of the only thing
that could one day exonerate you...
A full confession of my own.
"Vito Splendido" made me an offer,
and I'm thinking about taking it.
Jack encouraged me to go.
I think it's odd that he's trying to push you to leave
now that Emily's single.
You're trying to manipulate me.
No, I'm just trying to get you to open your eyes.
Daniel and I forced my father out of "Voulez."
If there was any way I could extricate you
from this new battle with Victoria, I would.
It's time I put something to bed.
Pascal, I've got Victoria's trump card.
I received your gift.
I will never betray you again.
The letter's not enough to incriminate the Graysons,
but Pascal has a piece of the puzzle that I don't.
Aiden.
"TWM" Is Trevor Warren Mathis.
Pascal was talking about my father.
As children, we flinch at the sight of blood,
not yet realizing it means family, loyalty,
and is the essence of life.
But for all its virtue...
Father?
...There is the unavoidable reality
that blood is often the child of pain...
...And a violent reminder that anything can be taken away
in the blink of an eye.
No!
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I'm fine.
Thinking about the past doesn't make for restful sleep.
You know, I just want to march next door
and ask that bastard what he did to my father,
but I know that would put Pascal on alert.
Well, especially since he and Victoria
are already conspiring against me.
Come on. I made some coffee.
Nolan hacked into my father's phone and employment records,
even looked into the police investigation after his arrest.
Nothing can link him to Pascal or anybody
in the days leading up to his murder, so...
that letter's still a mystery.
Well, then...
Maybe we should talk about that time...
since we have nothing else to go on.
Oh, what's there to talk about?
We thought my sister had run away.
and while we're reeling from that, flight 197 happened.
Uh, the police came 'round,
asking questions about who put the bomb on the plane.
And when my father shot himself,
it just confirmed what everybody thought.
That he was a terrorist.
Which I thought myself for many years...
until I found out Colleen had been kidnapped
and he was forced to do what he did...
Which just made his suicide even more shameful.
He took the coward's way out. She needed a hero.
Well, there is one more thing we could try.
But I can't do it alone.
Whatever you need.
Morning.
Waking up to you these past few mornings...
I've missed feeling like this.
You were wasted on Conrad.
It was a mistake.
Marrying for all the wrong reasons
resulted in such misery, hmm.
Let me deal with Emily.
No. I will.
I'll come back.
Yes?
Mr. Grayson is here for you, Mr. Lemarchal.
Look, I get why you're mad, okay,
but this silent treatment's lasted three days.
And now that I'm back at "Voulez,"
I want you there, too.
You used me to turn Margaux against Jack.
I just tried to get you both to see the light about that guy.
I'm sorry for the way I did it, all right?
Just so you know, your little plan didn't work.
I'm helping Jack with his move.
Char, I'm not making this up, okay?
You know how tight he is with Emily.
Tell me you've never wondered what their connection is.
I don't care.
Carl's my nephew.
And Jack has never been anything but nice to me.
And what if you're blindly defending the man
who's helping Emily demolish this family?
Could you ever forgive yourself?
Ah, I sense the stench of romance is in the air.
I won't talk about her.
That's not Victoria I was referencing.
Well, it seems that the only kindness you'll grant me
after I gave you leverage to get into her bed
is to keep her out of this conversation.
I owe you nothing, okay?
You can look me in the eye
and tell me that you're reneging on our deal
instead of hiding out and playing house.
And while you nurse the wounds of your new loss,
I'm already breaking in to the South American market.
You wouldn't know where to begin.
Alberto Loya jumped at the mention of my name...
Much like people once did at the mention of yours.
Our business is done.
Hello, mother.
Aiden.
This is Emily... my fiancee.
It was my late husband's grandmother's.
I've loved it ever since he put it on my finger.
And have you set a date?
No. No, not yet.
Oh, it's so dark in here. You never open the curtains.
No. People still talk.
Oh, well, I -- I doubt that.
Is that why I haven't seen you in eight years?
Well, Emily, uh, made me realize
I've not been dealing with everything that happened, so...
that's -- that's why we're here, yeah?
Then maybe you can help him understand
why this subject is best left alone, Emily.
Mum, well... maybe it would be good to talk,
you know, help -- help deal with things and --
and -- and you, too, you know?
Um...I mean, you've --
you've been holing yourself up in here --
This is my life.
You wanted out. You got out.
I knew we shouldn't have come here.
I don't want to cause her any more pain, Emily.
Yeah, but if we can find what the connection was
between Pascal and your father,
then maybe we could take some of that pain away.
Guess who's the proud owner of a 30-year mortgage.
We can move in whenever we want.
Congratulations, Jack.
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
No worries.
Hey, kid.
You just got yourself a yard.
We should celebrate.
Hello?
No, I didn't know.
I'm on my way, yes.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, babe.
Go ahead.
Don't forget your keys.
That's right. Let's get you out of the sun.
There you go. There you go.
What's wrong, Jack?
Margaux's first move was re-hiring Daniel Grayson.
His first move was trying to split us up
by telling her that I had feelings for Emily.
If a woman falls for that...
she must think there's something to it.
Rudy.
Rudy, my competitors read your feed,
so, no spoiler alerts, but trust me --
this launch is gonna be beyond redic.
The program is called Myclone,
and it'll have you talking to yourself in no time.
Are you romancing the blogosphere?
See, techies love it when you call.
It makes them feel so... retro.
And speaking of,
my lawyer sent over our business contract --
Old-school hard copies.
I still can't believe
we are going into business together.
Well, believe it, partner.
Partner?
Yo, why does this say that
you plan to own 70% of the company?
The program won't be market-ready
until I iron it out, and, uh,
I'm assuming all the financial risk here, so...
You have plenty of bank. Investing in this --
It doesn't put you in the poorhouse,
but it does put you back on top, right?
Excuse me? - Your last idea --
if memory serves, it landed you on my cellblock.
And before that, was I even born yet?
That's a low blow, I mean, even for you.
Look, any other investor
would ask for much more and care a lot less.
Well, maybe I should find out for myself.
I got your message.
What's so urgent it couldn't wait?
I'll be back.
Why is my brother in Miami to negotiate a deal
as important as increasing our stake in the Americas?
I was right here.
Well, I've decided to step down in two years.
I think it's time for me to enjoy other things.
I sent Gideon 'cause he is to take over.
You're grooming him to run things?
He has shown loyalty and determination.
You pulled away at every turn.
I got into the best schools on merit,
worked from the bottom up at our competitors,
and approached you only when I was ready.
That's why I asked to launch "Voulez" in the States.
This has never been my final stop.
Then why make plans to become
a part-time wife and stepmother, huh?
Of course you can't comprehend a woman
who can work and have a life.
That's why you came back for Victoria.
I imagine she's sitting at home waiting for you.
I have work to do.
It's been far too long.
What a surprise, albeit an honor,
to receive a visit from the queen herself.
You look well, Mason.
And you still lie elegantly, Victoria.
My skin is sallow and my wit squandered,
though I take solace knowing that
I walk in the shackled footsteps of the greats --
Cervantes, Wilde, Voltaire,
all imprisoned as I.
Now, to what do I owe this pleasure?
Emily Thorne --
She's been sniffing around my family's history.
And as I take a step back, I can't help but notice
her ties to one thing in particular.
I can't imagine what.
Now, you're the premier expert on the subject.
Did Emily's name ever come up in your research?
I will say this.
I was very interested in Emily at one point.
What was the genesis of your suspicion?
If you think I'm going to spill my secrets for nothing,
your hubris is as offensive
as my former cellmate's grooming habits.
Oh, well, what would our visit be
without a hint of the mercenary?
What do you want?
A brunch of lobster benedict and a gibson
at Bella Monica's...
as free man by, say...
end of the month?
Oh, I'd love a table by the window...
if you can swing it.
Guard!
All right, let's go, Treadwell.
Oh, did I wake you?
No, no, I was just gonna grab a glass of water.
I don't sleep most nights, so I clean.
I'm sorry about today.
Aiden's just looking for closure.
You're marrying a man with the broken heart
of a 12-year-old boy.
And I don't know how to help you heal it.
Well, that's... sort of what bonded us.
My father died when I was young, too.
I'm sorry to hear that, Emily...
though try to imagine such a loss made worse by scandal.
Trevor and Aiden were so close.
Spent hours in the shed doing all sorts of projects.
After that plane crash,
Trevor shut him out and hid back there alone.
He must have felt so abandoned.
Still, at least he defended his father,
even though his classmates called him a murderer.
And what did he get in return?
The honor of finding Trevor dead.
Aiden found him?
I never knew.
Everything changed so quickly --
His sister running away, his father taking his life,
and me trying to wrap my head around
that version of a stranger I married.
I'm glad he's found a little piece of happiness with you.
I can only hope the same for Colleen.
Your daughter?
I know it's been years...
but I hope the life she ran away to is a happy one.
I am flattered, Mr. Grayson, but...
my negotiations with Pascal and Lemarchal media
are too far along.
We are in final talks.
Your South American media conglomerate
is the belle of the ball, and yet your friend Pascal
didn't deem you worthy to meet in person.
He had pressing business in New York.
He's a busy man.
Well, that business is screwing my ex-wife.
And he's also screwing you
by not giving you full disclosure.
Within two years, you'll be doing business
with his kid, not Pascal.
Where did you hear this?
I overheard Gideon throwing his new title around with the concierge.
Specious bravado has been the kid's calling card since he was 15...
Whereas...
this is mine.
Call me optimistic, but...
welcome to Grayson media.
Oh, I can feel the anger from here.
My father is stepping down
and handing over the company to my idiot brother.
Which one? Not -- Not Gideon?
I'm sure he has his reasons.
Well, they're obvious.
He's a man. I'm not.
And while Gideon's only learned how to use the corporate card,
I've studied every single deal Pascal has ever made.
I've built a successful business,
but yet the only thing that man sees
is me throwing my life away for Jack.
Don't let him get to you. Okay? He's not worth it.
No, you're right.
You're right.
This is gonna bruise.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to see this side of me.
I kind of like it.
I'll get you some ice, okay?
Yeah. Thank you.
Jack.
What a nice surprise.
You okay?
Yeah, my father -- he makes me so angry.
What did he do?
No, forget about it.
Why? 'cause Daniel talked you down?
Yeah. I saw that.
Daniel and I are friends.
I don't like jealous men.
I'll see you later.
Hello?
Bad time?
No contact -- that was our agreement.
When exactly do you intend to keep up your end of the deal?
When I'm finished.
You were almost killed after a marriage
I can only imagine was supposed to
have a very different honeymoon.
I could have been stuck in here forever,
spotting a guy named Little Shiv on the bench press.
I want to renegotiate.
You have no leverage.
Ah, but I do.
I had a visitor.
We gabbed about old times,
laughed about a certain juvie girl.
What do you want?
To know how you intend to keep your promise to me.
Show me your hand within 24 hours,
or I'll show my visitor mine.
Ticktock goes the Clarke.
Mason knows who you are?
Yes, and he threatened to expose me,
so I shut him down.
Oh, and she's being delicate.
You framed Mason for crimes he didn't commit
and then forced him to confess to them.
Why would he agree to that?
'cause he's a celeb author with only one best seller.
She promised him the exclusive rights to her story of revenge.
Now Victoria is tempting him.
I'm worried he'll talk.
So, Ems, what do we do? You're in Jolly Ole.
We can't exactly traipse in there.
They record every conversation.
No. No, they don't.
No. They don't
Jack.
I'm not gonna let this hack railroad you, Emily, okay?
Hey, I heard there was a new homeowner in town.
Charlie, taking a break from distracting my juvenile,
who, once again, has gone delinquent.
Yes, Nolan, I thought I'd see my nephew
and maybe the new house.
Carl's out with Stevie,
and I can't -- I can't leave right now.
Well, if you're starting to pack,
I've got some boxes in the car.
I'm, uh -- I'm sorry, Charlotte,
But, um, we're kind of busy right now.
Was that Emily?
And who's trying to railroad her?
I'll, uh -- I'll have to call you later.
Thanks for the boxes.
Yeah, sure.
What happened? My mom stand you up?
She's late.
The great Pascal Lemarchal
wrapped around a woman's finger.
I could say the same.
My daughter fires you,
and you run back at the first opportunity.
You're totally oblivious
to what an amazing daughter you have, aren't you?
I give her credit where it's due.
No, you don't.
No, y-you've got her pigeonholed at this magazine
when she's capable of so much more.
You were always so fond of her.
Yeah, I still am...
as my business partner.
She's got a boyfriend, remember?
It's hard to recall since she never brings him around.
I met him briefly at the opera.
Yeah, and I'm sure he seemed like a --
a real nice guy.
Isn't he?
What I do know is that
she's always wanted your love and respect.
And I just hope that she's not
settling for something less than she deserves
because you never told her that she was worthy.
All right. See you around.
When I heard I had new counsel,
I'd never imagined I'd rate the one and only Stevie Grayson.
Have we met before?
No. But I certainly dined on your reputation
when I was a young journalist
covering nightlife for the daily news.
Your antics inspired the poetry of prose.
And your antics earned you a life sentence.
Well, at least you still have the bite of a stiff drink.
Now, since I'm sure you're presenting as my lawyer
so this conversation can't be recorded,
my burning question is, for whose team are you playing?
I'm here to help Emily follow through
on the promise Amanda Clarke made to you.
Emily? Wow.
She's such a devoted friend.
This is a motion to set aside your conviction.
You'll be out in a few months.
Ms. Thorne has also transferred funds
into your canteen account for sundries.
Sundries?
I'm looking for a lot more
than some salve to brighten my complexion.
It's the only option.
Is it?
Tell Ms. Thorne...
I'm going with what's behind door "G."
No!
No, father!
No. No, father.
Aiden?
You know, I...
I haven't been back in here...
since...
you know, every time I'd, uh, look out my bedroom window
and see our code on the door,
I'd just hate him a little bit more.
"Boys only."
Yeah, we'd devised this -- this code
where you'd just write the bottom halves of letters and...
silly, really.
He made me feel like we were
sharing some -- some great secret...
When, in fact,
he was the one keeping secrets from us.
Well, you're keeping some, too.
Aiden, you have to tell your mom that Colleen is dead.
I can't.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her
when I thought that she'd been kidnapped.
My mother's hope for her children is all she has left.
I can't take that away from her.
But you could offer her something different --
some answers about the man that she loved.
You're not gonna leave this, are you?
Have I ever?
What is it?
I've never seen this before,
And I'd know because this table
is the last thing my father and I worked on.
"Oscar chapman."
Who is that?
I don't know.
But my father obviously wanted me to.
Whatever you're holding over Mason Treadwell, let it go.
We need him out of jail.
Oh, the man confessed...to murder
and sabotaging the government plane you boarded
in the desperate attempt to turn state's evidence,
and, lest we forget his most heinous sin,
trying to frame me for it all...
on my wedding day.
Which is why you had him put away.
I assure you, I did nothing of the sort.
Or is this lunacy
a ruse to enter my suite?
Oh, what's the matter? French grass not greener?
Were we not bound by our sins, I would be nowhere near you.
Emily's interested in Flight 197.
And I think Mason knows why.
Oh, he knows nothing but how to spin a tale.
And as long as Emily is your enemy,
well, she's an ally to me.
Hello?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Thank you.
Guess who visited Mason in jail today.
Stevie.
It seems like your ex-wife is up to her old tricks.
And if she's working for Emily, god help her.
It was good to meet you.
I wish you only happiness.
Thank you, Mrs. Mathis.
I'll be outside.
Yeah.
She's a lovely girl.
Yeah.
Yeah, she is.
Mum, please sit down.
I need to talk to you.
I-I haven't been honest with you.
Emily and I...
We aren't together.
I needed someone to come with me,
and she was the only person that I would have by my side.
Why lie to me?
I just... wanted to give you some happy news after my absence.
I'm sorry.
I understood when you left home at 16.
Life here was horrible.
And you kept in touch as well as young men do.
But when you disappeared just like your sister,
I wondered what I'd done wrong.
Colleen didn't run away, mum.
Some men took her.
And they promised that they'd bring her back
if dad planted a bomb on the plane.
Eight years ago,
I tracked down the men who had taken her,
and I found her.
I'm sorry, mum.
She's gone.
And what about the men?
Also dead.
Good.
I never let myself believe your father was a monster.
I'm sorry.
You snuck out.
What about Nolan?
Aren't you worried about jeopardizing your partnership?
I think you mean internship.
He tried to get me to sign a totally bogus contract.
But why would he do that?
'Cause he knows Myclone is next-genTwitter level,
and he wants to get his name trending.
I thought we were tight,
but it seems the only person that guy jumps for in a minute's notice
is that blond girl... Emily.
And I know they've never even
Ever.
Though she has many men at her beck and call,
including my friend Jack.
Porter, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, Nolan had me help him the day I got here...
Some file-decoding emergency at a law firm.
Jack.
Yeah.
So, they have their little gang, and I guess I'm not a part of.
Tell me about it.
Actually, I know someone who can help you.
Who?
My brother.
I had you when I was 19.
I didn't know how to be a father.
Instead of raising you, I raised an empire.
And our relationship suffered.
And it was easier to have a connection with your sons.
No. It's just, by my second marriage,
I was a better father.
Margaux.
My awkwardness with you,
it's because of my regret.
What is this?
My 5-year plan for the company.
We should be further along with new media acquisitions.
You're being too lax.
And your position on the DST deal last year...
That was a mistake.
A mistake.
I would've handled it differently, papa.
Then tell me.
Oscar Chapman was a free lance reporter based in London,
worked for Lemarchal Media in '93
died in a car accident.
It's another dead end.
Don't lose hope yet.
Well, why not?
This whole thing's been a waste of time.
You know that's not true.
You reconnected with your mother.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I can't believe you've been carrying all of that.
Emily... thank you.
I know you have a crisis here with Victoria closing in,
but...
You stayed by me, so...
We've always been there for each other.
I've missed you, too.
Open the gate!
Now!
What the hell kind of game are you playing?
I assume this visit isn't an overdue "thank you"
for signing over the deed to Grayson Manor.
You never gave a damn about that house.
You've been after my family from the start.
What's your interest in Mason Treadwell?
My clients are none of your concern.
Oh, I thought you'd clam up...
So I brought along an old friend.
There was a time when the smell alone
was enough to make you sloppy and so, so chatty.
Get the hell out of my room.
I probably should...
... since anyone you try to take into your confidence
ends up deceased.
Or didn't you know that Mason Treadwell
was found dead in his cell tonight?
What?
You meddled where you shouldn't,
with no concern for the consequence.
You may be sober, but you still can't think clearly.
Watch your back, Stevie...
And those of the people you love.
If my, uh, high-school French serves,
allow me to answer. Your son was busy
blatantly trading your name for favors
and acting like his ascension was a fait accompli.
He wasn't to share that.
Mm. Dommage.
Well, since he's already botched that task,
allow me to congratulate you on your retirement...
though announcing it so early is quite the gamble.
I mean, imagine the panic, the rebel through your company,
making it easy for vultures to swoop in and feast.
And you are one of them.
Ah, foul of me, perhaps,
but your loyal deal was my first carcass.
The acquisition will be announced in the "Journal" tomorrow.
Daniel.
My father is grooming me to take over the Lemarchal Empire.
Really?
So I wanted to pop by and thank you.
I didn't do anything.
You've been a good friend...
beside me for the whole ride.
Since I was a 16-year-old girl
complaining about her father.
Until right now, tonight.
Yeah.
You know, you were always special.
That's why I challenged you
to every impossible ski slope when we were kids.
You just -- you just kept winning.
Yeah.
We'll make a great team, Daniel.
And if I'm going to run the company,
I'll need greatness by my side.
So...
Come on, let's celebrate then.
Hey. You haven't been answering your call--
What's going on?
I...
I heard Mason died in... in...
I'm in over my head here.
This damn place, Jack. I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
You have nothing to do with what happened to Mason.
I thought I was helping, and I --
and I ended up hurting someone.
God, I never wanted you to see me like this.
I want you to -- I want you to go.
Just go please.
I'm getting you out of here.
No. Oh, no.
No, I don't --
Jack.
I don't want to be the first bad memory in your new house.
You won't be.
I'm taking you home to L.A., okay?
Come with me.
Please come with me, and we could start over.
And you could bring Emily
'cause she has to stop this.
She can't.
This is everything to her.
And I'm --
I'm coming back here to help her finish.
Maybe Daniel's right.
You love Emily, don't you?
I miss you.
It's been an eventful few days.
Yeah, I agree.
Conrad has decided to declare war.
Well, then, so have I.
I ran Stevie Grayson out of town,
and now it's time to test my theory about Emily Thorne.
Seems we're both at war.
We have reservations.
We're not going to dinner.
What? No. Get me out. I'll be dead.
Get me out of here!
Nolan Ross.
And you said you didn't need sundries.
God, your skin. You just look so alive.
All credit due to Emily's face cream,
which contained a Japanese herb
that makes the body mimic death for 12 hours.
What the hell?
We're outside of the gates?
Well, that was your request, right?
Cash and a new identity.
My private jet will whisk you away to the Maldives,
where Emily has provided you with the perfect writer's retreat --
a bungalow off the grid.
Which makes me a part of one of Ms. Thorne's infamous plans
in a story that she's obviously still very committed to finish.
We need to know that we have your allegiance.
I only bartered with Victoria
because, frankly, I'd lost faith.
But...
consider me reborn. Dead in a way, maybe.
You know, I never thought I would say this, but...
it's good to see you, Mason.
And what shall we talk about
in our soon to be resumed ride to the field?
Oh, well, I've got a few questions about another dead reporter.
Ever heard of a Oscar Chapman?
Hey, Nolan.
What?
Yeah, I'll tell him.
Okay, bye.
What? Has Mason been neutralized?
He's in the air.
But before he left,
he told Nolan that Oscar Chapman faked his own death.
You don't think he just wants us chasing loose tails?
What, and further delay his magnum opus? No way.
The man who might know Pascal's connection could still be alive.
Then we better pray we can find him.
