第二十六季第十九集
oh , for gloy vin &apos; out loud .
well , this is a no @-@ brainer .
now what ?
well , i better get going .
should i just put that on your tab ?
no , i &apos;ll pay off my bill .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
someone &apos;s actually paying ?
now let me see if i remember how to open this thing .
some kind of button or knob .
so that &apos;s what that noise means .
just take your stupid money .
hey , this jacket &apos;s full of old stuff .
i knew i wasn &apos;t getting my money .
losers .
what the ... ?
here &apos;s a roll of film i never developed .
well , too late for that .
all those photo developing joints
are either knocked down or have been turned into deer blinds .
eh , listen , homer .
uh , i can develop this for you .
yeah , this bar is so poorly lit ,
it &apos;s legally a darkroom .
and the best part is ,
duff is chemically indistinguishable
from developing fluid .
way to go , duff !
i &apos;m developing quite a thirst .
now , there &apos;s an eight @-@ by @-@ ten i can enjoy .
here you go , midge .
i played with the colors and changed the lighting ,
but i could only make your kids so cute and no cuter .
this is so exciting .
it &apos;s like a sneak peek
into the long @-@ forgotten world of six years ago .
yeah , well , beware .
these pictures show that six years ago ,
bart and lisa were fighting
like creationists and common sense .
hey , photos don &apos;t lie , my friend .
would you like a matte finish ?
sure .
there you go .
* and i know if i don &apos;t *
* i &apos;ll go out of my mind *
* better leave her behind with the kids *
* they &apos;re all right *
* the kids are all right *
* the kids are all right *
homer , you shot all these pictures .
why didn &apos;t you step in ?
the light was so good , marge .
it was like florence in may .
i don &apos;t get it .
how come i was always fighting with senorita stupid ?
don &apos;t waste beer .
and how did we reach
the uneasy alliance we enjoy today ?
well , it &apos;s quite a story .
a story of a special bond between a brother and a sister .
i &apos;d say our story is a tragedy .
like the planet of the apes .
the tragedy being they can never stop making them .
hey , come on .
the first and eighth movies were pretty darn good .
now , as for you kids ,
it all began six years ago .
the president of back then was the president .
the popular music of those times
was all the rage .
wherever we went , you kids fought .
&quot; penny the penguin wanted to go to the north pole .
wally the walrus wanted to go to the south pole . &quot;
i guess you could say they were &quot; polar opposites . &quot;
you see , they &apos;re polar opp ...
i get it .
it &apos;s just not funny .
you know what &apos;s funny ?
this .
goodnight moon ?
good night , bart !
did i hear someone whispering hush ?
i want you to get out .
and stay out !
thank you .
so that &apos;s why we started going
to story time at the kwik @-@ e @-@ mart .
remember when apu let dad have the expired hot dogs ?
just once , and i &apos;m still taking medication for it .
so many photos of you kids fighting .
that &apos;s why we never developed that roll .
what ? back to that story .
why can &apos;t you just relax and be nice to your sister ?
my bed scares me .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
now , just close your eyes
and nuzzle in
under the big clown fangs .
attaboy . sweet dreams .
she took my pencil .
lisa , there are plenty of mini golf pencils
in the kitchen drawer .
tell bart ,
because it &apos;s my pencil and he stole it !
starfish head !
i can write your name better than you .
you jerk !
why , you little ...
where is he learning this violence ?
things got so bad between bart and lisa , i was losing sleep .
homer .
homer , i just had the worst dream .
i lost one of the kids at the world &apos;s fair .
it &apos;s okay . which one ?
brisbane &apos; 88 .
that &apos;s so horrible , baby .
i know , i know .
now , don &apos;t worry .
they &apos;re right here in the bed .
we have to find some answers .
answers ?
that &apos;s your answer for everything .
my findings are that one of your children is smart and good ,
and the other is dim and evil .
professionally , i &apos;m not permitted
to say which is which .
is it the boy ?
i told you , i can &apos;t say .
what did that say ?
we &apos;re done here .
not so fast .
we have 40 minutes left .
all right , we &apos;ll do a trust exercise .
shut your eyes .
what are we going to do ?
it &apos;s not so bad , sweetie .
i took a box of altoids from her waiting room .
the most anyone has ever gotten out of therapy .
watch it !
trying to mow .
the city &apos;s making me do this .
hey , neighboreeno .
maude and i know how hard it is
to be dealt a pair of little jokers .
daddy , may we please go tuck ourselves in for naps now ?
now , you know you can &apos;t tuck yourselves in till you &apos;re 18 .
go get mommy .
i &apos;m sorry you had to witness that .
me , too .
anyway , maude and i thought
you &apos;d like to hang out with adults
and have some mature conversatiaroonies ,
so we &apos;d like to take you to brunch .
brunch ? i wish .
can &apos;t get a sitter &apos; cause our kids are nuts ,
and no kennel will take them .
now , sir , don &apos;t you waffle on that brunch .
grandma flanders can watch the kids .
hello , joe .
doesn &apos;t know who i am ...
has trouble moving ...
i &apos;d say we have ourselves babysitter .
i just turned a hundred .
eight bucks an hour .
i can &apos;t hear you .
i said seven bucks !
&quot; woe to you , scribes , pharisees , hypocrites .
for you tenth mint and dill and cumin . &quot;
todd , i like how gentle you are with that toy .
enough nonsense .
it &apos;s time for prayers .
i don &apos;t know any prayers .
is &quot; hell &apos;s bells &quot; a prayer ?
&apos;cause daddy says it all the time .
ziperoo .
i never said this before , but the food can wait .
what do you mean ?
let &apos;s role- play .
okay , but fast .
um , um , got it .
me , seagull .
you , boardwalk trash can .
well , isn &apos;t this a great chance to drink more water ?
my bladder &apos;s going to burst .
i know you &apos;ve had few too many waters ,
but that is no reason for the sailor talk .
she &apos;s awfully quiet .
her body usually whistles .
well , this always wakes my grandpa up .
* another bride , another june *
* another sunny honeymoon *
* another season , another reason *
* for what we &apos;re doing *
they &apos;re never that happy when we &apos;re around .
ice cream truck !
mmm , that was wonderful .
my favorite kind of weekend morning .
a sexy snuggle while our rotten kids are someone else &apos;s problem .
bart , those are strangers .
you &apos;re right , let &apos;s go where it &apos;s safe .
watch it !
faster , faster .
your brother is stupid .
bye @-@ bye .
* the wheel i &apos;m inside goes round and round *
* round and round , round and round *
* the boat i &apos;m on board goes up and down *
* up and down , up and down *
thank you for a wonderful brunch .
i don &apos;t know what i liked more--
the personalized omelets or the light jazz combo .
i liked when the trumpet player &apos;s cheeks got really big .
that &apos;s good music .
grandma flanders has passed .
where are our kids ?
gone .
looks like once grandma turned to dust , they took a powder .
sorry if that seems a little flip .
oh , god , oh , god , oh , god .
don &apos;t worry , sweetie .
we &apos;ll call the local police , and they &apos;ll find our kids .
we never used them till now ,
but i &apos;m sure they &apos;re highly competent .
gunderson , before we hire you , one final test .
can you get these handcuffs off of me ?
uh , might seem like a one @-@ time situation , but it &apos;s not .
hey , you know , i used to represent
silver star police supplies .
then they gave my territory to the owner &apos;s nephew .
and they wonder why they lost jackson city .
i was jackson city !
yeah , focus on the cuffs , please .
well , well .
look who &apos;s burning plastic .
it &apos;s mine . give it back .
looks like someone hasn &apos;t learned--
you don &apos;t argue with bullies .
thank goodness i have a teaching fist .
what &apos;s her problem ?
please , don &apos;t hurt my brother .
aw , come on . don &apos;t cry .
this is why i &apos;m so nervous about becoming a dad .
i &apos;m crying out my nose .
fine , you babies can go .
let &apos;s go over to mommy &amp; me
and cut holes in the parachute so it doesn &apos;t billow properly .
baby !
all right , let &apos;s move .
why aren &apos;t you crying ?
i was pretending , and it worked .
you know , kid , with your smarts and my barts ,
we make a good team .
what are &quot; barts &quot; ?
you &apos;re the smart one , you figure it out .
i sure hope this book is right .
1 一个人出去找 另一个守着电话 2 出去的那个会搞笑就更好了
marge , i &apos;m back .
sorry , nothing .
but if we have a third kid , we should call her maggie .
why maggie ?
it &apos;s a good name if we lose her .
maggie ? maggie ?
going back out .
maggie ?
all right , i &apos;m turning to a desperate mother &apos;s last resort .
i hope it works .
psychic hotline .
selma ? you &apos;re a psychic now ?
i &apos;m filling in for a friend .
she got hit by a car .
never saw it coming .
i &apos;ll never see my kids again .
i &apos;m sensing ...
it &apos;s all your husband &apos;s fault .
that &apos;ll be $ 20 .
i know this place .
it &apos;s where grampa and his friends the monsters live .
i want to pinch &apos; em .
teach me how to use my phone .
stay away from my grandchildren , you love @-@ sucking ghouls .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
i made it out of clay .
where did you go ?
now , you have some candy ,
while i tell the nurses station to go get your folks .
i guess you should be in charge , lisa .
you &apos;ll always be half my age ,
but you &apos;ll always be smarter than me .
don &apos;t worry , bart , you &apos;ll always think you &apos;re in charge ,
even though i secretly will be .
thank you .
okay . listen up , you childless losers .
i need you to help me find my kids .
any of these them ? hmm ?
uh ... no .
sorry , kids .
i &apos;ll place you with your parents ,
but for now , go back to making those little drink umbrellas .
homer , we &apos;ll definitely help you ,
but , uh , you &apos;re gonna have to wait .
we just ordered a pie for the bar .
what &apos;d you do that for ?
yeah , it took us 45 minutes to choose a topping .
we decided on cheese .
twice !
a new record .
we &apos;re lost . can you help us ?
i &apos;ll tell my dad about you right now .
dad ! dad ! dad !
cartoons .
milhouse , keep it down .
i got to finish these tax returns .
ooh , cartoons .
whoa ! big dog ! big dog ! big dog ! big dog !
i &apos;m scared , bart.
once , i read a book called jack and jill .
they went down a hill .
and broke their crowns ... !
good thing we don &apos;t have crowns .
&quot; crown &quot; means head !
ay , caramba !
ta @-@ da ! i saved you !
ugh ! but you pushed me !
duh . i couldn &apos;t save you until i pushed you .
girls make no sense !
anyway , we &apos;re even @-@ steven .
i just don &apos;t want to fight anymore .
okay . but it was always your fault .
fine .
&apos;cause you &apos;re a jerk .
can &apos;t you see i &apos;m giving in ?
i beat a two @-@ year @-@ old , i beat a two @-@ year @-@ old .
你见过我吗
i left my kids with the weirdo next door ,
and now they &apos;re gone !
tell me everything .
homer , no !
i &apos;d give anything to have them back .
i don &apos;t care about the fighting .
hey , chatterbox , there &apos;s a couple of kids
right there at the top of the tire fire .
how did you get up there ? !
you know how kids like to climb things .
what are we gonna do ? !
they say you &apos;re supposed to get great strength
when your kids are threatened .
i &apos;m kind of feeling it .
we just bought them new shoes .
you did it , homie !
小丑充气床
ice cream truck !
bart ! haven &apos;t you learned anything ?
i &apos;m still learning our phone number .
and i &apos;ve almost got it .
but in an emergency , i &apos;ll just dial 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 8 .
but the wonderful thing is , you kids get along .
and we were able to have a third beautiful child .
wait . but how did you have an extra room for maggie ?
well , that &apos;s where i used to grow my weed .
but that &apos;s a story for another day .
never mind , never mind .
重症监护室
well , i didn &apos;t think she &apos;d make it , but i was wrong .
i guess your grandmother just wants to stick around
to see those boys grow up .
* amazing grace *
* how sweet the sound *
loud singing could kill her .
and it did .
stop telling us this story !
you &apos;ve had three natural endings already !
isn &apos;t that sweet ?
six years ago , they were fighting .
now they &apos;re playing pool in a bar .
father of the year , pal .
