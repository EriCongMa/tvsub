bust @-@ out
you have to be 110 % sure this is who you saw .
this is definitely him .
had you ever seen him before ?
no .
and the other man ?
i didn &apos;t get a good look at him .
the light reflected off the car . but he was heavyset .
it was really dark . i didn &apos;t want to be seen .
i heard shots but i thought they were firecrackers .
when the two men drove out , i hid in the ragweed .
sure .
what happened began to dawn on me .
but like i told the officers ...
... i left the flat tire and walked to a phone .
thank you , mr. arthur .
i &apos;m so goddamn fed up with crime .
i had to come forward to help you find them .
thanks to people like you , we may just do that .
may i ask who the dead man was ?
just a poor kid in the wrong crowd .
crack ?
something like that .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy ! mommy ! no !
mommy !
hey ...
what &apos;s the matter , you lost ?
uh @-@ huh .
you scared me half to death ! i can &apos;t turn my back for a minute !
i know what that &apos;s like . my little guy was a real cadet at his age .
tony !
it &apos;s good you could meet me .
no problem . i went to brookstone and got a scale .
what &apos;s it about ?
fucking dick barone .
as long as the two of you are happy .
i &apos;m in no mood .
this garbage business . i found out that bow @-@ tied motherfucker ...
... is charging me double to tip my trucks at his place .
so pay the tonnage , and charge your townships extra for the pickups .
i got the smallest amount of routes of anybody in the association .
you &apos;re like the old woman with ham under her arm , crying for bread .
what the fuck ?
never mind . the point is ...
... your brother , jack , never concentrated on sanitation ...
... so what do you want dick to do ?
i want a rate .
i &apos;ll see what he says .
yeah . you see . since you own part of the company .
did you shut all the lights ?
yeah .
in the kitchen ?
yeah .
i want to spend more time with aj .
it &apos;s the other one who &apos;s almost out of the house .
i &apos;m not worried about meadow . meadow can take care of herself .
why the sudden burst of fatherhood ?
can you say anything without sarcasm ?
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s a good idea . he adores you . he never spends enough time with you .
yeah , well ...
i was reading in time , this study at harvard .
&quot; a father &apos;s support is absolutely linked ...
... to a boy &apos;s later capacity to manage frustrations ...
... to explore new circumstances ...
... and do well . &quot;
kid needs to toughen up .
no , i &apos;m talking about opening up .
he needs some street smarts .
not to be a sucker , or get involved with the wrong people .
i don &apos;t want another christopher on my hands . look at him .
he &apos;s lucky to be alive .
that other poor prick they found dead .
kid was 23 or something .
hey , pal , with the raml a ...

that &apos;s not a mistake .
i want another 14 gross of model number 4784 .
plastic picnic coolers . ship them , i &apos;ll worry about selling them .
red . fuck blue , red sells .
put it here .
put that on the store tab .
he says take three gross of the blue , he &apos;ll give us a price on the red .
fuck that . he &apos;s never getting paid anyway .
they gotta be all red . just do it , please .
thank you . goodbye .
who gets chicken and peppers ?
a lot of work to move picnic coolers .
coolers are like scissors ...
... everybody wants one , nobody has any idea how much they cost .
you put a nigerian on the street , have him sell these ...
... for a couple bucks apiece , who &apos;s not gonna say , &quot; fuck it , give me one &quot; ?
how we doing with them airline tickets ?
won &apos;t it raise a flag with the travel agency ?
a sports store charges tickets in bulk ?
say it &apos;s for promotion . customer of the year , salesman of the month ...
... that kind of thing .
don &apos;t worry . you put it on different credit lines .
suddenly i &apos;m ordering all this shit .
i mean , picnic coolers , raml a water ...
when do they realize i &apos;m not paying and call the cops ?
when your fucking credit runs out , diamond jim .
until then , get on the horn and order .
unless you can pay us the principal you owe .
hey !

mister !

pleased to meet you . but if you don &apos;t have a warrant , get out .
i &apos;m busy .

what do you got for me ?
a partial list of the major investors in webistics .
i haven &apos;t seen tony in a while .
besides the night he capped bevilaqua ?
what do you mean ?
did you fuck me ? !
did you fuck me ? !
take it easy .
how about i put a bullet in your stupid boar &apos;s head ?
he was spotted , sal . so don &apos;t go pulling my taffy .
as of this second , if you lie to me ...
... you will never see the streets for 50 fucking years !
did you know about this ?
no .
if you knew soprano was planning something ...
... and didn &apos;t wear a wire ...
i told you no !
there was someone else there that night .
a quote , unquote : &quot; husky accomplice . &quot;
yeah ?
yeah .
but the witness couldn &apos;t i.d. him .
oh .
were you the perp he couldn &apos;t i.d. ?
what , are you fucking crazy ?
what did i tell you , huh ? no fucking violence !
i ought to burn you and let the judge throw away the key !
i &apos;m deciding to believe you . but here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
i want tony &apos;s voice on tape , saying , &quot; i killed matthew bevilaqua . &quot;
no distortion . no throat clearings . no nose @-@ blowing .
i get it . but let me ask you something .
if i did ride with tony on something like that ...
... wouldn &apos;t that get me tighter with him , raise my coinage ?
make tony forget all his suspicions ?
you &apos;re a cute prick , puss .
get me tony on tape talking about this murder .
who &apos;s the witness ?
no joke , sal . you don &apos;t want to see my darker side .
go .
lf they had enough to pinch you ...
... there &apos;d be bars between us as we speak .
why do they want me to go there ?
lock you into a story .
so later at trial , any contradiction will sink you .
we going ?
did you say you &apos;d go ?
please .
all right , procrastinate .
let me get our ducks in a row . keep your cool and go the speed limit .
don &apos;t give them an in .

don &apos;t give them an in .
are you all right , tony ?

christine , i &apos;m so glad you stayed .
i kind of wanted to .
when i found out about eric &apos;s car , i told tony to give it back ...
i wish i could say this is a first for david , but ...
eric is going to college , and maybe it &apos;s better for his grades .
so april 1 , huh ? how i dread it .
so long as eric gets into georgetown .
it &apos;s his first choice .
meadow wants to go to berkeley .

oh , jesus , richie .
i gotta be loyal .
without that , we crumble .
tell that to paul castallano .
i &apos;m old school , janice .
all i mean is , my brother needs help .
teaching him manners is one thing .
my uncle junior still has friends ...
... and he thinks the world of you .
&quot; when your opponent gives you an opening ...
... be swift as a hare . &quot; sun tzu .
when i think of that jacket i gave your brother ...
... and he spit on it ...
... i could slice an ear off his head .
richie , wait .
ma , if you need something , call . i &apos;ll bring it up .

a flag @-@ saluting motherfucker .
maybe you should lamb chop it for a while .
i keep a suitcase in my trunk .

fuck all youse . bygones are never bygones .
this is a nightmare . i &apos;m gonna have to move some cash .
if i go , i &apos;m going with a package . not like massucco .
he had five minutes to run ...
... and ended up in a rat motel down in elvis country .

where there are no jews or italians .
i don &apos;t get it .
it &apos;s starting !
it &apos;s starting !
get back in your office , david !
i open my mail and it &apos;s a lawsuit ! it &apos;s a fucking lien on the building !

you don &apos;t know what he said .
i did too .

i understood .
what &apos;s it mean ?
it means , &quot; sit on this , cocksucker ! &quot;
five minutes away from life in prison and i &apos;m fucking laughing .
you gotta , skip , you gotta .
davey never takes me to dinner .
yeah , when you &apos;re dating it &apos;s all candles and wine and ...
dave &apos;s been even more preoccupied than usual lately .
well , he &apos;s busy .
carmela , my husband has a disease .
a serious gambling problem .
i am so sorry .
thank god the store &apos;s in my name .
he can &apos;t sell it without me , or he would have gambled it all away .
but i &apos;m gonna make sure we get through this .
give me those .
i &apos;m gonna make you two beautiful women a special @-@ tasting menu .
i was hoping he &apos;d say that .
i know you ordered the pellegrino , but i want you to try this .
i got such a deal on this raml a .
it was nice to meet your brother . he seems very interesting .
he &apos;s a doll . when his wife was dying , he waited on her hand and foot .
a widower ? so young .
breast cancer .
i thought there was a sadness about him .
and the children ?
childless . she had a hostile womb .
i had a dream about him .
you did ?
christine .
he asked me about you too .
he was wallpapering my dining room .
it was your subconscious telling you you want him to wallpaper the room .
hey , cucuzza !
i got something for you .
what ?
a fenwick rod and a penn international reel .
thanks .
wanted it for christmas , remember ?
but it was back @-@ ordered ? well , i got a great deal on it .
we &apos;ll take the boat and go fishing .
okay .
what are you doing now ?
you want to go fishing now ?
no , i figured we &apos;d see a movie or something ...
... get some pizza .
i can &apos;t .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m going to the mall .
you gotta go to the mall ?
not just me .
brad , allen , heidi , her sister maybe .
like a double date .
no , dad . we &apos;re just going to the mall . we go there sometimes .
and do what ?
get something to eat . mrs. fields .
anyway , i gotta go . i &apos;m meeting them there .
all right . go ahead .
see you later .
yeah , my girl did the same thing ...
... at his age . boys and girls , always in a group .
what &apos;s that about ?
what &apos;s it about for you ?
in my day , a boy and girl went on a date .
your father hoped you wouldn &apos;t get too far or you &apos;d knock her up ...
... and her parents would break your legs .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s about him going to the mall with a group ...
... that bothered you .
wasn &apos;t it that he went to the mall instead of going with you ?
he &apos;s starting to get his own life .
one that doesn &apos;t include you .
it was always , &quot; we &apos;ll do this . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re gonna do that . &quot;
i &apos;ve heard you talk many times about being with your son .
well , that &apos;s over now . gone . done .
it &apos;s bittersweet , this period .
you &apos;re glad that they &apos;re growing up , but you &apos;re sad to lose them .
i could be going away .
for a very long time .
for something i didn &apos;t do .
how about , &quot; that &apos;s too bad &quot; ? or , &quot; what a shame , tony &quot; ?
we can &apos;t go into specifics on this .
here &apos;s something specific .
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong . we can &apos;t talk about it ?
i could be going to the can for the rest of my life ...
... and i &apos;m not supposed to discuss it with my psychiatrist ?
what the fuck are you for anyway ?
how does that feel ?
the idea that you might be sent to prison ?
i gotta stay around a little while longer for the kids .
especially my boy .
once he &apos;s out of the house , the government can do what they want .
give me life , the chair , whatever .
i &apos;ve never seen you like this .
like what ?
scared .
i wouldn &apos;t use that word .
but sometimes i feel ... i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know .
you motherfuckers ! you motherfuckers !
i don &apos;t fucking deserve this !
how &apos;s your medication ?
maybe we should stop .
what ?
don &apos;t have the witness yet .
nothing ?
this is the fbi , ton .
local cops , buy them a christmas tree , they &apos;ll give up their grandmother .
you know how tight these feds can keep it .
go home , get some sleep .
you don &apos;t want to stop by the bing , get something to eat ?
tell me , t , what do you want me to do ?
just let me think . come on .
all right .
tony ! what are you doing here ?
could ask you the same question .
it &apos;s my store .
congratulations , it &apos;s a fucking disaster .
the airline tickets came in . you want me to split them with you guys ?
they &apos;re mine . it was my idea .
this is where you sleep ?
yeah , sometimes .
it &apos;s easier than going home .
i know what you mean .
i remember when you transferred into 10th grade from ...
... baden @-@ baden .
fucking army brat .
remember when those paterson guidos caught you up at garret mountain ...
... and you were in your dad &apos;s car ...
... and i threw a rock at that guy ?
don &apos;t reminisce on me .
you told me not to get in the game .
why &apos;d you let me do it ?
i knew you had this business , davey .
it &apos;s my nature . frog and the scorpion , you know ?
besides , if you would &apos;ve won , i &apos;d be crying the blues .
right ?
what &apos;s the end ?
the end ? it &apos;s planned bankruptcy .
you &apos;re not the first guy to get busted out .
this is how i make a living . it &apos;s my bread and butter .
when this is over , you &apos;re free to go .
oh , for chrissake .
anthony !
dig !
anthony ! anthony , dig !
come on !
anthony !
oh , my god , that was so exciting !
i banged my foot . i would &apos;ve came in second .
you were like a fish out there .
where &apos;s dad ?
he couldn &apos;t make it .
he had a meeting . he &apos;ll be here next time .
this is the last meet of the season .
next year , i mean .
okay .
got a safe ?
yeah , why ?
you want to pay in advance ?
there &apos;s over 400 k there .
i want you to hold it for me . this goes down , i &apos;m out of the area .
my wife will come for a weekly allowance .
you don &apos;t ask her any questions and you never , ever refuse her .
if she wants it all ...
... you give it to her .
she won &apos;t do that . she &apos;s smarter than that .
and if the money doesn &apos;t last ?
don &apos;t worry , you won &apos;t go into your own kick .
this witness can &apos;t remain nameless forever .
i didn &apos;t hear that !
don &apos;t you got school tomorrow ?
so ?
so it &apos;s late . go to bed .
did you hear me ?
i hope you apologized to him .
for what ?
you promised to be at his swim meet .
oh , shit , i forgot .
how could you forget ?
there was something i had to do .
he almost came in second . you should &apos;ve seen his face .
i saw his face when he went to the mall ...
... and i wanted to go to the movies .
are you 6 years old ?
i said i &apos;d try to be there .
what is with you , tony ?
this whole week ...
... you &apos;re like an alien life form .
there &apos;s nothing wrong .
thank you for sharing .
know what , leave me the fuck alone . i &apos;ll make up for the swim meet .
where were you ? did you see chris at the hospital ?
yeah , i went to see christopher at the hospital .
wherever you were , it &apos;s more important to let your son know you care !
no , only you care . fuck you .
no , fuck you !
fuck you ! you fucking ... !
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
hey .
my god , you scared the shit out of me .

i think you should go to bed .

christine told me about her . i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you .
we were talking about the powder room ?
do you have a minute to look at it ?
oh , yeah , sure .
the paper here now ...
... i think it kind of closes the room in .
i see what you mean . it &apos;s the vertical striping .
somebody even talked me into papering the back of the door here .
i must have been out of my mind .
it &apos;s a lot for the eye to handle in such a confined space .
so , what do you think ? should i just paint or do something plain @-@ ish ?
just grass cloth , maybe , or ...
oh , jesus .
jesus , mary and joseph . i never did anything like this before .
i couldn &apos;t help it .
i never felt like this before .
it won &apos;t happen again .
of course not .
i apologize .

this fucking guy was supposed to be laid out on midland avenue a year ago .
i know it and you know it .

yours is far enough along that ramone can finish up .
there &apos;s no charge ...

no , i wouldn &apos;t think of it .
it &apos;s just that ...
... since jill , there hasn &apos;t been anyone to talk to .
oh , i know .
in fact ...

maybe you could send ramone to the other job tomorrow .
that way you and i would have a chance to talk , on your lunch break .
that would be so great .
and i could make a lunch for us .
maybe a galantine de poulet ...

france , 1944 .
general george patton leads his third army into battle .
he knows that the controversies around him have tarnished his reputation .
he desperately wants to vindicate himself in the only way he knows how :
in battle .

sleep well , my friend .
major strategy is the attack .
&quot; the more germans we kill , the fewer of our men will be killed , &quot; he said .
his hatred for the enemy ...

so this person , the witness ...
... simply changed his or her mind ?
i don &apos;t know what happened .
