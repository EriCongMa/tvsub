no , no . that &apos;s all right . go join your wastrel friends .
what &apos;s the matter ?
jackie aprile loved knowledge .
when he was dying of cancer , he prayed his son would go to medical school .
lf he knew he dropped out of college , break his heart .
lt didn &apos;t hurt the beatles , bill gates .
his uncle richie &apos;s looking out for him .
easier than dealing with his own son .
tony , don &apos;t do that .
he &apos;s taking aj to the dirt bike championships .
aj can &apos;t go . he got a c in algebra .
does carmela know about this ?
you really want to know ?
l don &apos;t want him around my kids .
richie ?
you heard me .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
ask gia gaeta .
richie told me all about that .
the transmission slipped out of gear .
he &apos;s lucky he wasn &apos;t crushed too .
for your information , beansie gaeta owed major dollars for 1.0 years .
and richie didn &apos;t ask for interest .
why not ?
lf we &apos;re so awful , why throw us an engagement party ?
because you &apos;re my sister . and l try to do what &apos;s right .
anyway , it &apos;s my wife &apos;s thing .
lnclude planking that russian girl of yours ?
you know what ? be in denial .
be a codependent to a shitbag . what the fuck do l care ?
you just can &apos;t stand to see me happy , can you ? you motherfucker .
shove that settee up your ass .
l love my new pony boots , tony .
yeah , nice .
why don &apos;t you wear them during your interviews ?
you call sy littman yet ?
no , l &apos;m doing it .
there &apos;s good money in modeling .
you don &apos;t want to spend the rest of your life at a department store .
what do you care what l do ?
don &apos;t start with the moody shit .
what is that ?
chicken soup for the soul .
read &quot; tomato sauce for your ass , &quot; the ltalian version .
why ? you jealous ?
you fucking him ?
l can &apos;t have a conversation with you .
lt &apos;s a fucking question .
maybe you ought to think about it .
finding somebody who can give you everything you want .
l told you , he drives a limo .
l &apos;m not talking about those things .
l &apos;m talking about a family , marriage , children .
l don &apos;t want to find someone. l have you .
to take you out to dinner and screw your brains out ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
tony , no . don &apos;t go .
you don &apos;t know what the fuck you want !
don &apos;t yell at me , please . this is a bad time .
my new boss is so mean to me .
lt &apos;s always a bad time . with the cousins--
tony ! no , please , no !
you know it hasn &apos;t been good for a long time . for either of us .
l &apos;ll die without you .
no you won &apos;t . you &apos;ll forget about me in two weeks .
no , if you go , l &apos;ll kill myself .
don &apos;t you fucking threaten me , rina .
this is over. l can &apos;t do this anymore .
l &apos;m not gonna do it anymore .
you talk to that guy about the modeling .
l &apos;ll take care of you till you get on your feet .
but l &apos;m not doing this anymore . understand ?
l hate you !
so that &apos;s it . albert splits nutley with the d &apos;alessios . . .
. . .and barone keeps everything north of paterson .
what else we gotta talk about ?
fairfield taking bids next week .
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
fairfield &apos;s mine .
was yours .
l don &apos;t give bids to the handicapped .
obviously , you &apos;re deaf. l told you 1.0 times .
l find out you still deal blow on those routes .
for that l &apos;m losing a fucking bid ?
next time you &apos;ll be in back of one of your trucks .
those were my father &apos;s routes !
kid .
actually , fellas , my cousin larry wants the fairfield contract .
being the hardship on his family while he &apos;s awaiting trial .
see ? this is why we have a fixed @-@ bid club .
everyone wants to be at the head of the line .
l been in line for 1.0 years .
he &apos;s asking for what my father would &apos;ve given if he was boss .
lt &apos;s not because they &apos;re brothers . you respected my father , respect richie .
those who want respect , give respect .
see , he just told you to shut the fuck up . . .
. . .and he told me to go fuck myself .
this bill , mel . jesus .
l wish this trial would happen. l &apos;m hemorrhaging spondulicks here .
the minimization process could be very good for us , corrado .
we hire experts to study the wiretap tapes .
former bureau guys , very thorough .
lf they find abuses , we take those findings to the judge . . .
. . .and possibly have all the wiretap evidence thrown out .
l know the feds stay on the phone longer than the 20 seconds . . .
. . .they &apos;re allowed to see if the call is relevant. l hear a click .
l could be talking about root beer . . .
. . .and sometimes they stay on 40 , 50 seconds before they hang up . pricks .
but it &apos;ll cost , the study .
how much ?
two hundred plus hours of tapes .
l want to bring on specialized counsel to handle the wiretap litigation .
ballpark figure ?
yeah , wrigley @-@ fucking @-@ field .
four hundred thousand .
did my nephew say where l &apos;m allowed to move the coke ?
he don &apos;t give a shit about nobody .
this country &apos;s going through boom times with more garbage than ever .
he won &apos;t let me eat .
you want to cry money problems ?
l &apos;m facing 20 years. l could die in the fucking place !
you &apos;re gonna beat it , skip .
you don &apos;t know that !
that coke is my lifeline right now .
break it down , jun.
what choice does he give ?
we need allies to do what you &apos;re thinking about .
albert barese didn &apos;t like what he was hearing .
and by extension , larry barese . biggest fucking crew in the family .
that doesn &apos;t surprise me .
larry &apos;s thought about why he &apos;s under indictment and others ain &apos;t .
what do you want me to do ?
go talk to ally boy . feel him out .
but he &apos;s a slippery fuck . don &apos;t commit .
l &apos;ll see you .
he &apos;s got tremendous moxie for his size .
tell me about it . he &apos;s a fighter .
what &apos;s this ?
open it .
no , l can see it &apos;s j.w. gold . but we can &apos;t accept gifts , sal .
l &apos;ll pass it to the guys .
see ? that right there .
you &apos;ve a policy you stick to . you don &apos;t get distracted .
look what happened to those egyptians . those world trade center fucks .
serial numbers on an axle and everyone behind bars .
what the fuck is all this ?
l owe you , skip . the rest of my life. l &apos;ll never forget .
you looked the other way on that bevilaqua beef .
the bureau would never turn its head on a murder charge .
what else could you say ?
what do you know about scottsdale ?
arizona ?
l &apos;ll live there when this assignment is over .
assignment ?
when l &apos;m in witness protection .
there &apos;s more than 300 days of sun , golf , giant &apos;s spring training .

l think l &apos;ll take courses while l &apos;m in the can .
psychology , criminology .
give lectures at police departments on oc .
that &apos;s an idea .
an airline ticket from the scatino bust @-@ out .
tony made a guy order blocks of these through his sporting goods store .
l &apos;ll put it on file .
you could use it as cause for a warrant .
evidence of extortion , intent to defraud . those are rlco predicates .
first , you have to tie the ticket to tony .
and he &apos;s too smart to use any of them himself .
he probably moved them by now .
however , this engagement party for the sister ?
l &apos;ll wire you up. l know you &apos;re sensitive--
what the fuck was l , his errand boy ?
the saturn , yeah .
looking for his kid &apos;s teacher &apos;s car .

she &apos;s a completely different person since prozac .
since what ?
janice .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this shit . they got the old lady on prozac .
&quot; she &apos;s changed , &quot; my ass .
she &apos;s just too senile to remember who she hates .
what &apos;s wrong with you today ?
what do you care ?
go , richie !
everybody . . . .
l want to thank my future in @-@ laws for making a great party .
and l want to thank you all for coming . . .
. . .and celebrating with us this historical union . . .
. . .of the apriles and the sopranos .
they say it &apos;s never too late . . .
. . .and they say all good comes to those who wait .
right on both counts .

stepmom .
thanks , rick .

you got one leg . you &apos;re not like that .
her parents were alcoholics . . .
. . .in petrozavodsk . horrible , industrial city .
the father died , 55 years old .
lung cancer , cirrhosis of the liver . good thing .
anyway , he was not working . the factory was closed down .

this is such a happy time .
all the flowers , all the excitement .
l remember how l felt .
then there &apos;s the honeymoon and the hope chest .
you &apos;re working overtime here .
remember how radiant l looked ?
you &apos;re depressed , aren &apos;t you ?
depressed ? l leave that to others .
l &apos;m just realistic .
because in a year , tops , you &apos;re gonna have to accept a goomar .
oh , yeah ?
ls there a goomar that lets him hold a gun to her head when they fuck ?
you let him hold a gun to your head during sex ?
lf that gets him off. lt &apos;s the same as garter belts and uniforms .
well , it &apos;s a gun , janice. l thought you were a feminist ?
usually , he takes the clip out .
well , jesus , l hope so .
lt &apos;s a ritual. lt &apos;s fetishistic . that &apos;s all .

fucking guy thinks l &apos;m his friend now .
we &apos;re not supposed to accept gifts , and poor people will get this . . .
. . .but l can &apos;t resist the lard bread .
he &apos;s turned some corner .
one minute he talks about how he loves soprano , then he &apos;s a junior g @-@ man .
talking about rlco predicates and probable cause .
now we &apos;re the good guys .
lt &apos;s the worst case of stockholm syndrome since patty hearst .
that was sad .
l &apos;ll tell you , though . . .
. . .l &apos;m worried about sal , with these fantasies of law enforcement .
this can work two ways , skip . you can find yourself getting too close .
so you &apos;re getting married . settling down , eh ?
one door opens , another door closes .
lt &apos;s a fucking expensive proposition , though .
l didn &apos;t need that shit the other day .
you don &apos;t need that shit .
you talk to the king of dermabrasion about it ?
l &apos;m talking to him and he &apos;s looking at his reflection in the plexiglas .
lmagine getting a face @-@ lift , and one week later you &apos;re in jail .
can you imagine that ? one week later you &apos;re in jail .
anyway , l had the feeling you didn &apos;t like what you were hearing .
larry expected to get fucked .
now that &apos;s a sad commentary .
richie .
what &apos;ll larry do ? the guy &apos;s a guest of the government .
while some are stuffing themselves .
some people are stuffing themselves .
larry &apos;s got a trial coming up .
he &apos;s in no position to go into the unknown not knowing .
how about you , albert ? you can weigh in anytime .
l &apos;m with him .
all things being equal ?
no .
make a move against tony soprano ? no way .
l don &apos;t know what to tell you .
vic ?

the name of the store &apos;s on your supplies. l wanted to talk .
l &apos;m sorry. l should &apos;ve called .
you have nothing to be sorry for .
l should &apos;ve told you l wasn &apos;t coming .
l got the message when you didn &apos;t show up .
that &apos;s why l wanted to talk to you. l wanted to thank you .
for what ?
maybe someday l will be free .
but if you had come that day , l might have done something . . .
. . .that l would be sorry for forever .
l wanted to thank you for thinking for the both of us .
for being strong for us both .
thank you .
well , you &apos;re welcome .
goodbye , vic . and take care of yourself .
oh , thank christ ! jesus !

she should &apos;ve been seen by the psychiatrist in the hospital .
he was a romanian . they have some beef that goes back centuries .
she wouldn &apos;t talk to him .
do you feel responsible for her suicide attempt ?
l was banging her for two years .
was that a hardship on her ?
that &apos;s cute .
l &apos;ve had many women . why can &apos;t l say &quot; fuck it &quot; with her ?
why do you think ?
well , she &apos;s a sweet kid underneath it all .
l think she &apos;s seriously depressed .

l &apos;m interested in why you &apos;re ending it .
what do you mean , why ?
lsn &apos;t that what l &apos;m supposed to do ? don &apos;t you tell me that all the time ?
l &apos;ve never passed judgment on your sex life or any patient &apos;s sex life .
even if l &apos;m 20 years older than her and l &apos;m married .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
why now ?

richie didn &apos;t come home . she &apos;s worried .
oh , sure , he probably jilted her. lt &apos;s the story of her life .
what kind of a fucking chance did she have with you as her mother ?
you &apos;re always nagging her about her weight .

l &apos;m gonna wait out in the car .
l never said anything of the kind .
l heard you .
you make things up .
you tell me .
now you tell me when l ever did anything to any of you .
you don &apos;t know , do you ?
you don &apos;t have a fucking clue .
l wasn &apos;t always perfect , but l always tried to do the best .
l know you didn &apos;t , any of you , didn &apos;t like it when l told you what to do .
babies are like animals . they &apos;re no different than dogs .
somebody has to teach them right from wrong .
but l was your mother ! who else was gonna do it ?
lf you ask me , l did a pretty damn good job .
that palace you live in up there on that hill .
l gave my life to my children on a silver platter .
l suppose now you &apos;re not gonna kiss me .
what ?
you &apos;re cruel , that &apos;s what you are .
oh , fuck this .
oh , don &apos;t . . . . no .
how you doing , hon ?
who sended you , tony ?
he asked me to bring this .

yes , you do .
there &apos;s $ 75,000 in here .
seventy @-@ five ?
listen . . .
. . .lrina , l know you &apos;re upset . but let me give you a little advice .
ln my business l see girls come and go . so l know .
time is the great enemy . you &apos;ve got a very short window .
lt &apos;s not good to get too hung up on any one thing .
on the other hand , something new always comes along .
l &apos;ve seen it a million times. lt &apos;s called passages .
lt &apos;s a book .
he &apos;s right , lrinushka . he &apos;s very smart man .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
l &apos;m not gonna forget this , tony. l owe you . god , do l owe you .
all in all , l &apos;d say it was a good visit .
what &apos;s wrong with our family , tony ?
l go to a shrink .
she says that our mother has a narcissistic personality .
who knows how she got that way .
grandpa vito was no prize as a father .
that &apos;s not all the shrink says . she says . . .
. . .that ma is a person who was incapable of experiencing joy .
dad , all he did was experience joy .
richie told me you were going to a shrink .
l used to suggest it , and you &apos;d blow your stack at me .
maybe you ought to think about going back into therapy .
what &apos;d you do with him ?
we buried him .
on a hill .
overlooking a little river . with pine cones all around .
you did ?
what the fuck ?
what do you care what we did with him ? why do you want to know ?
but l loved him so much !
you &apos;re gonna miss your bus .
l &apos;m sorry , tony. l am so sorry .
all right . all right . go ahead .
meadow , you have a ups. lt &apos;s up in your room .
what are you doing in here ?
you &apos;ve been gone all night . what the hell happened ?
janice decided to go back to seattle .
you &apos;re kidding ?
well , what about richie ? he must be devastated .
richie &apos;s gone .
what do you mean &quot; gone &quot; ?
gone .
where ?
after 1.8 years , don &apos;t make me make you an accessory after the fact .
an accessory after the-- ?
holy shit .
stop asking .
oh , my god !
oh , my god .
i took care of it .
that was not a marriage made in heaven .
what &apos;s all this ?
after meadow &apos;s graduation , me and rosalie aprile are going to rome .
for three weeks .
excuse me ?
we &apos;re gonna stay at the hassler . shop .
and try and see the holy father .
what are people gonna say , you go for three weeks ?
