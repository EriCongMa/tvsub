male reports that there &apos;s a domestic argument
in front of south seas sportswear .
be advised we &apos;re receiving
numerous calls on this domestic .
back at it again , i see .
three years in a row .
yeah .
you are such a good dad .
aw , that &apos;s very sweet . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
what ?
you know that &apos;s code for she thinks you &apos;re cute .
yeah , i know that that is , but tamara &apos;s mom
thinks everybody &apos;s cute-- that &apos;s why she &apos;s been
married and divorced three times .
well , you know what they say :
fourth time &apos;s the charm .
what &apos;s up , lou ?
what do you say , danny ?
what , uh , what are you doing here ?
well , we &apos;re doing a little community service
as penance for someone &apos;s recent transgression .
daddy , i said i was sorry .
yeah , i remember .
do yourself a favor . don &apos;t let yours grow up .
no , i don &apos;t want her to grow up at all .
where is your daughter , by the way ?
she &apos;s , uh ...
oh @-@ oh ! hey , hey ! where are your gloves ?
grace , what did we just talk about ?
put it down .
what are you doing ?
put it in the bag .
go use a whole bottle of sanitizer , okay ?
what do you think &apos;s in here ?
what do i think &apos;s in it ? uh , trash , okay ? more trash .
you know , there &apos;s some medical waste
over there you can go play with if you &apos;re interested .
it &apos;s not trash , danno . i think it &apos;s a puzzle .
can you open it , please ?
of course i can open it .
this doesn &apos;t open .
all right , i got an idea .
i &apos;ll make a call later tonight .
i &apos;m gonna call santa claus and ask him
to bring us one of these with instructions .
i want to see what &apos;s inside that one .
come on . it could be , like ,
a gold coin , a treasure map , a letter from someone
stranded on a desert island .
come on . don &apos;t you want to know ?
don &apos;t touch it again , please .
yeah .
oh , let me guess . i come pick you up , right ?
thanks .
thanks .
guess it &apos;s casual friday .
must have missed the memo .
oh , that &apos;d be funny if it wasn &apos;t tuesday .
annual beach cleanup at gracie &apos;s school .
right . which i &apos;d much rather
be spending my christmas eve over there
than with a dead guy , all right ?
so if we could speed this up , that &apos;d be nice .
well , in that case . male vic ,
gsw to the head , most likely a nine @-@ millimeter .
shooter did a pretty good job of covering his tracks .
there &apos;s no clothes , obviously . no wallet , no i.d.
nothing on the vic except the gift wrapping .
who found this guy ?
fritz over there-- caught a whiff
of our db in the trunk and alerted the owner .
well , i , uh , i don &apos;t speak dog .
maybe you want to question him .
hey , come here , buddy .
come on . right here .
come here . all right , good dog . look at this .
you know something ? you &apos;re actually a lot
funnier in short pants , you know that ?
is that right ?
yeah . what about this car ?
owner said it came in three days ago ,
but there wasn &apos;t body in it when it was inventoried .
which means that someone must &apos;ve snuck in and
dumped our vic inside .
okay , and how &apos;d the shooter get into this place ?
a lock was cut on the gate around back . i got csu
checking it for prints and tool marks right now .
what happens to these cars once they &apos;re crushed ?
apparently , they get sent over to china
where they &apos;re sold as scrap .
whoever did this was smart .
i mean , if it wasn &apos;t for fritz here ,
this thing would &apos;ve gone according to plan ,
and we would never be investigating this murder .
there goes our holiday .
hey , fritz .
thanks a lot .
any luck locating adam in seattle ?
no , but i got a hit off his mother &apos;s maiden name
on some recent atm transactions in canada .
so i &apos;m going up there to run it down .
you really think adam could be there ?
i don &apos;t know , but i gotta check it out .
be careful , kono .
love you guys .
mele kalikimaka .
hey , max .
oh , gentlemen , come on in .
you are just in time .
time for what ? a game of operation ?
i would prefer if you would refrain
from making your mildly entertaining witticisms
as this takes complete concentration .
yeah , no , i know you don &apos;t want to make
the buzzer go off , right ?
i don &apos;t envy you , commander .
uh , we get an i.d. on the vic , max ?
well , i pulled prints and dna ,
and sent them over to the lab .
we are currently waiting for the results .
however , i do have an early christmas gift for both of you .
i found something intriguing
underneath one of the victim &apos;s fingernails .
it &apos;s latex , most likely from a glove .
we didn &apos;t find any gloves at the scene , max .
it &apos;s possibly a professional requirement .
maybe he was a surgeon or a dentist .
or the noblest profession : medical examiner .
maybe he was using the gloves
&apos;cause he was gonna kill a medical examiner .
ah , witticism .
there you are , my little friend .
no wonder you were such a challenge to extract .
see the way it &apos;s mushroomed like that ?
it &apos;s a jacketed hollow cavity .
they &apos;re designed for rapid expansion
and maximizing tissue damage and blood loss .
not to mention massive disruption of ballistic evidence ,
which means it &apos;s unloadable into ibis .
okay , our victim &apos;s been shot execution style ,
a well @-@ planned body dump , and now we got this
highly lethal ammunition that cannot be traced .
i am saying that this is not this guy &apos;s first barbecue .
he &apos;s done this before .
fingerprints on our john doe came back .
he &apos;s not in the system .
no , but we did have some luck with his dna .
hit came back to 12 unsolved break @-@ ins here on oahu .
so , this guy &apos;s a burglar .
that would explain the latex
that max found under his fingernails .
i mean , our victim could have been wearing gloves
because he was involved in the commission of a crime .
police reports indicated that all the burglarized homes
had a security system and hidden safes .
so the guy did his homework .
definitely a pro . take a look at this .
he used low @-@ tech items
like a glass cutter , tin foil and silicone
to bypass some very complex alarm systems .
in fact , he was so good at covering his tracks ,
that some of the victims didn &apos;t even realize they &apos;d been robbed
until days or weeks after they &apos;d been hit .
maybe could be the burglar surprised a homeowner ,
paid for it with his life .
if that was the case , why wouldn &apos;t he call the cops
after he shot the guy and claim self @-@ defense ?
why would he dump the body ?
i agree with him .
we know our shooter &apos;s a pro , right ?
so , uh , maybe these guys are in it together .
they , uh ... they get into a dispute over some money .
one guy kills the other guy , uh , dumps him in the junkyard .
what are friends for , right ?
wow , someone &apos;s cynical .
yeah , well , that &apos;s what happens when you take my
day off away from me . let &apos;s i.d. this guy ,
put him in jail
so i can get back to my daughter , please .
recognize this guy ?
no . who is he ?
he is a local burglar who &apos;s been hitting
high @-@ end homes all over the island
for the last six months .
looks dead .
he does look dead . that &apos;s very observant .
um , do you know his name ?
sorry .
despite of what you may think ,
i don &apos;t know every undesirable on the island .
but don &apos;t you have a computer that does ?
yes , we do .
uh , we &apos;re just doing this for redundancy .
you just snarked yourself out of a favor .
no , please , listen , okay ? just ignore this man
and do this for me , would you , please ,
kamekona ? come on .
well , there is this brutha down in north shore ,
owns a pawnshop .
specializes in hot merch .
okay , nice .
talk to him . see what he knows .
okay ? please .
shoots .
what are you doing ?
knitting a sweater .
what does it look like i &apos;m doing ?
where &apos;d you get that thing , anyway ?
grace found it on the beach .
you know , you &apos;ve been playing with it ever
since you got in the car .
it can &apos;t be that hard .
whoa , whoa , what are you doing ?
don &apos;t cheat . why you ... why you gotta cheat ?
cheat ?
yeah , cheat .
show me the rules . show me where it says i can &apos;t do this .
you know what ?
this is just pathetic .
give it to me .
what are you going to do with it ?
i &apos;m gonna open it .
oh , you think ? okay .
go ahead , &quot; houdini . &quot; you need this ?
no , i don &apos;t need that .
very nice .
you know , uh ... you know what you are ?
yeah , smarter than you .
nope , that &apos;s ...
smarter than you .
that &apos;s not what i was gonna say .
you &apos;re welcome , by the way .
what is that ?
where &apos;d you say that beach cleanup was again ?
ki &apos;i dunes .
you know there &apos;s been , uh ,
tsunami debris washing up in that area recently , right ?
from the japanese tsunami ?
that was , what , three years ago now ?
little box .
big ocean .
i &apos;d say it could &apos;ve taken that long to get here .
* tiny bubbles *
* in the wine *
* makes me happy *
* makes me feel fine *
* tiny bubbles *
* make me warm all over *
what are you , uh ... what are you doing ?
&quot; tiny bubbles . &quot;

released by don ho in 1966 .
ah , and butchered by you here in 2013 .
i liked it .
&quot; butchered ... &quot; this is for you , brah .
what is it ?
cost of doing business .
no . this is ... this @-@ this is $ 300 .
what do you .... $ 300 for a ukulele ?
that &apos;s koa wood , brah .
and good information does not come cheap .
especially during the holiday season .
wow . you actually have a wallet .
i got $ 80 , all right ?
that &apos;s all i got .
figures .
here , you thief .
$ 220 more .
north shore brutha hooked us up
with the name of your dead thief .
victor dobbs .
word is , worked strictly big scores .
mostly diamonds and jewelry .
victor dobbs .
currently unemployed .
last job ...
he was a manager at the wailana electronics supply company .
well , with his background ,
that &apos;s how he could &apos;ve learned how to bypass a security system .
it didn &apos;t teach him how to dodge a bullet , though , did it ?
looks like he lived alone .
how ironic .
sorry . wrong house .
hey ! show me your hands . behind your head .
interlock your fingers .
easy , man .
aren &apos;t you a little early , santa ?
we checked out that laptop
that danny found in our vic &apos;s place .
these right here were taken inside the homes
that our burglar already hit , and these over here ,
these were part of his wish list .
what , these are places , uh , dobbs cased
and was intending to rob ?
that &apos;s right and wrong .
these were places he was going to hit ,
but he didn &apos;t do the casing .
that was all done by our guest , tim sapoli .
we got a hit off his prints .
he &apos;s got multiple priors .
did some time in halawa .
he &apos;s currently employed as a cable tv installer .
and it looks like he &apos;s our victim &apos;s partner .
how do we know that ?
because he &apos;s the one who e @-@ mailed
those photos to victor dobbs .
let &apos;s cut to the chase and talk about
what happened with dobbs , okay ?
i &apos;m thinking it was about money .
maybe he wasn &apos;t paying you enough .
maybe you wanted to renegotiate the terms of your deal
with him and it went south .
uh , i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s why you killed him .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
dobbs is dead ?
what ? you think i killed him ?
we think you put a bullet in him ,
dumped the body ,
then broke into his house
and tried to steal the computer
so that you wouldn &apos;t be linked to the photos .
listen , okay ?
the burglaries ?
fine .
i helped pull those off .
but murder ? no way .
i didn &apos;t kill dobbs .
you &apos;re going to have to do better than that .
i haven &apos;t seen him for days .
we were supposed to meet up after the last score ,
split the take ... - what score ?
i don &apos;t know .
my job was to feed him the leads ,
but he never told me
which house he was gonna hit .
so , what ? he just didn &apos;t show up for the split ?
nope .
never showed .
i kept calling him , but he wasn &apos;t answering .
i figured something must &apos;ve happened .
i don &apos;t know , maybe he pulled the plug ...
maybe he got arrested .
i never figured he &apos;d get himself killed .
you really expect us to believe that ?
why would i want my partner dead ?
dobbs was my meal ticket .
so , what ... you believe him ?
well , first of all , sapoli &apos;s got no alibi .
second of all , we caught him breaking into
the victim &apos;s house to destroy evidence .
so do i believe him ? no , i don &apos;t believe him .
but until we get something solid on this guy ,
all we got is a burglary charge .
my guys finished searching your suspect sapoli &apos;s place .
they found a weapon ...
glock nine @-@ mil .
that &apos;s the same caliber used to kill dobbs .
yeah . i &apos;m running it against the slug
that max found , but it &apos;s so degraded ,
it &apos;s a long shot .
but even if we get a match ,
we still have to put him at the crime scene .
if we could find it .
okay , well , given the latex found
under dobbs &apos; fingernail , he might have been killed
right after his last burglary .
so if we can figure out where that was ,
we can canvass the neighborhood ,
maybe turn up a witness or a security cam
that puts sapoli in the area around the time of death .
the problem is , there were no burglaries
reported last night .
all right , well , maybe , uh ... homeowners were out of town .
well , considering the skill of your burglar ,
these people might not even know they &apos;re victims yet .
catherine , pull up dobbs &apos;s wish list ...
all the houses he was targeting .
i can take it one step further and create a map .
okay .
chin , cath ,
split up these addresses , go door @-@ to @-@ door ,
see if any of these places were hit last night .
you got my guys , too , if you need &apos; em .
thank you .
charlie , what do you got ?
i managed to reconstruct the bullet max removed from your victim .
there was enough land and groove impressions for me to determine
that the round was fired by a browning .
no , no . the , uh , gun hpd recovered from sapoli &apos;s house
was a glock ... - was a glock .
which could mean your suspect
shot the victim using a different gun .
or he wasn &apos;t the killer .
i also processed the tarp
that your victim &apos;s body was found wrapped in .
contacted the manufacturer .
production was discontinued six years ago ,
so i &apos;m trying to narrow down what retailers sold them .
as soon as i can put together a list of transaction records ,
i &apos;ll call you .
all right , mahalo .
give me one minute , alright ?
go .
hey , charlie .
i know you got plenty to do ,
but , um , my daughter found this , uh , on the beach .
thought maybe you &apos;d take a look at it .
it &apos;s a puzzle box .
got significant water damage .
yeah .
i ... looks like it &apos;s been in the water for a couple years .
i was thinking that maybe it , uh ,
it washed up here from the tsunami in japan .
it &apos;s quite possible .
if you get any time , please , uh , look at it .
it means a lot to grace .
and you .
yes . uh , and me . look .
a lot of people died in that tsunami , charlie ,
and , uh ... this little girl here , uh , ... i can only assume
she meant a lot to somebody , so i &apos;d like
to find out what happened to her , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;ll do my best .
just checked the sixth house off my list .
nothing yet . how are you making out ?
i &apos;ve hit four . got nothing .
four ?
to my six ?
aren &apos;t you the one driving around in a muscle car ?
hey , you saw my list .
my houses cover a wider area than yours .
okay , then .
what do you say the last person
who gets to the bottom of their list
picks up the next tab at side street ?
you &apos;re on .
hi . can i help you ?
aloha .
i &apos;m lieutenant kelly . i &apos;m with five @-@ o.
gary nathan . what can i do for you ?
well , mr. nathan , we &apos;re investigating
a rash of break @-@ ins in the area .
we have reason to believe
that your home has been targeted .
are you serious ?
did you have any cable or internet work done here recently ?
yeah .
uh , a few weeks ago ,
i had a new wi @-@ fi system installed .
but what does that have to do with being robbed ?
our suspects are using service calls
to access people &apos;s homes .
a lot of our victims don &apos;t even know
that they &apos;ve been burglarized until days
or weeks after the fact .
mind if i take a look around ?
it &apos;ll only take a couple of minutes .
oh , of course , yeah . whatever you need .
thanks .
nice place .
how long you been here ?
couple years .
before that ?
denver .
we used to vacation in hawaii when i was a kid ,
so when the opportunity came up , i moved here .
denver , huh ? you a skier ?
used to be .
if you ever get the urge , you ought to try mauna kea .
it &apos;s on hawai &apos;i island .
actually snows there a couple times a year .
locals call it , uh ... pineapple powder .
i &apos;ll have to check that out .
mind if i take a look at your wall safe ?
how did you know i have a wall safe ?
as part of the investigation , we confiscated photos
of the homes that were cased .
and as i mentioned earlier , yours was targeted .
yes , you did say that .
it &apos;s over here .
here we go .
did the safe come with the house ?
no , i had it installed .
i &apos;m gonna need you to open it up .
excuse me ?
i just need you to verify that everything &apos;s accounted for .
oh . i don &apos;t need to see what &apos;s inside .
all right .
of course .
all good .
okay , you can close it back up .
what is it ?
it &apos;s tinfoil .
ah , probably a gum wrapper .
burglars use tinfoil to bypass security systems .
well , at least your prowler has uptown taste .
all his targets are in affluent areas .
we can forget about pawnshops .
this merch is being moved through a local fence .
excuse me , gentlemen .
commander mcgarrett ? detective williams ?
that &apos;s right . this is captain grover .
how can we help you ? ma &apos;am .
special agent rebecca conway , fbi .
how do you do ?
hpd crime lab ran a search
that flagged a case i &apos;m working .
specifically , the tarp and firearm information
that was entered linked to a series of murders that i &apos;m covering .
our suspect &apos;s killed 14 people that we know of .
12 on the mainland , two in hawaii .
you &apos;re saying we have a serial killer on the island ?
why are we hearing about this now ?
we &apos;ve been after this guy for long time .
didn &apos;t want to scare him into the wind .
and you think we &apos;re chasing the same guy ?
i &apos;m not totally convinced ,
but that &apos;s why i &apos;m here : to compare notes .
what do you got ?
in every case , our suspect holds the victims
for less than 24 hours .
all are bound and tortured .
the c.o.d. is always the same :
a single gunshot wound to the head
using nine @-@ millimeter jacketed hollow cavity bullets .
we think this is a mercy killing
after the horrific abuse that he inflicts .
so you &apos;re sure that the killer &apos;s male ?
the kind of atrocities
associated with this killer seem to be
a function of masculine traits .
particularly the way he disposes of the bodies ;
he &apos;s very practical .
he strips the victims of their clothing ,
wraps them in a plastic tarp
and dumps them in random locations .
the killer also likes to cut a single finger
from each victim &apos;s hand , which he keeps as a souvenir .
so he can relive
the fantasy at a later date , right ?
right . now , what i can &apos;t figure out
is that up until this point ,
all the victims have been females in their 20s ,
most likely targeted for those specific traits .
your victim is male .
and he &apos;s not missing a finger .
right .
but other than that , the m.o. fits .
i &apos;m just not sure why my guy picked mr. dobbs .
maybe your guy didn &apos;t pick mr. dobbs .
maybe mr. dobbs picked him .
what do you mean ?
we know dobbs was a burglar .
we also know that he pulled a job the night he was killed , okay ?
now , what if he was in the middle of that job
when this went down ?
you &apos;re saying he broke into the killer &apos;s house .
so that means
that he didn &apos;t choose to change his m.o. ,
but your victim forced him to .
what i &apos;m saying is it &apos;s possible .
do you have an address ?
we have people out in the field working on that right now .
pull them back . do it now .
if this guy knows he &apos;s cornered ,
he &apos;s going to run or do what he does best ,
which is take another life .
hey , steve .
leilani , you alright ?
yeah . i &apos;m sorry . um , i &apos;ve been trying to reach chin .
we were supposed to meet a couple hours ago .
have you heard from him ?
he &apos;s not answering .
if there &apos;s something wrong , please tell me .
hold on .
cath , catherine , where are you ?
pearl city . why ? what &apos;s going on ?
have you heard from chin ?
no , not recently .
why ?
okay , okay , listen to me very carefully .
i need you to stand down .
hpd &apos;s gonna hit the rest of the houses on that list .
do me a favor . call your people , okay ?
tell them we &apos;ve lost contact with one of ours .
we &apos;re gonna need all the help we can get .
you know , there are cops all over this neighborhood .
they &apos;re gonna find me .
you know , i don &apos;t know what it is you think you &apos;re doing , gary ...
but as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
all you did was kill somebody who broke into your house .
you know , a jury might look at that as self @-@ defense ,
but if you kill me , you &apos;re gonna die in prison .
you understand that , right ?
are you hearing me ?
think about it .
you know nothing .
you see now ?
you know nothing .
do you see me ?
yes .
i see you , gary .
i see you for who you really are .
you &apos;re above us all .
you &apos;re a living deity .
you control who lives and who dies .
you &apos;re lying !
you think i &apos;m a monster .
you &apos;re right .
i think you &apos;re a sick , pathetic little worm
who preys on innocent women for your degenerate needs !
my only question for you ...
why women ?
what did they do to you , gary ? huh ?
what do they represent ?
or maybe it &apos;s one in particular ,
and you just take it out on total strangers .
what , your mommy hurt you ?
maybe she locked you up in a closet when you were a little kid .
maybe you had a thing for her , huh ?
maybe , but she was always daddy &apos;s , right ?
you &apos;re mine .
i control you .
just like all the others .
people like you , you think you &apos;re so smart
that you know what &apos;s inside me ,
but you don &apos;t know and you never will .
you can &apos;t possibly imagine
what a great pleasure it is to have you as my guest .
gary ?
don &apos;t go anywhere .
gary ?
i heard someone here needs soup .
emily , hi . didn &apos;t you get my message ?
i ignored it ,
like any good girlfriend would when her man says he &apos;s sick .
oxtail soup from pho bistro .
your favorite .
oh , wow , you feel a little feverish to me .
yeah , you know , i think you &apos;re right ,
and the last thing you need is to get sick ,
so maybe you should just leave the soup and go .
don &apos;t worry , if i get sick , then you &apos;ll just take care of me .
look what you made me do .
yeah . grover . what do you got ?
really ?
all right , thanks . wait , hang on , hang on .
that was the impound yard--
they got a car there that &apos;s registered
to your murder victim , victor dobbs .
it was towed there from
a &quot; no overnight parking &quot; spot in kahala park .
okay , wait , there &apos;s a house on dobbs &apos; list
two blocks from there , uh , moa street .
all right , forget this place .
catherine , do me a favor . call agent conway .
have her meet us on site .
gary , what are you doing ?
it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s me .
no , no !
chin !
chin !
chin !
you all right ?
huh ? yeah .
thanks .
i wanted to be the one to pull the trigger .
be glad you didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s over .
you should let those families know .
you ever finish your sweep ?
almost . you ?
i got a little distracted .
okay , you know what ?
let &apos;s call it a tie .
a tie ?
no , i say a tie goes to the guy who got stabbed in the shoulder .
don &apos;t you think ?
sympathy play . okay .
i &apos;m sold . dinner &apos;s on me . ooh , all right .
oh , you buying ?
yeah .
who invited you ?
this grinch act of yours , just @-@ just stop it .
you know you like me .
you just have difficulty expressing your feelings .
i don &apos;t know how he feels about you ,
but he definitely likes a free meal . that i know .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
well , i don &apos;t want to put a fine point on it , but you are cheap .
look , in three years , when was
the last time you picked up a check ?
everything &apos;s about money with you . you &apos;re obsessed with money .
this specifically , yes , it &apos;s about money .
see , when the bill comes , what you have to do
is you have to reach in your pocket ,
take the lock off your wallet , take out the green paper--
it &apos;s called money -- and
you pay for the bill . that &apos;s how it works .
the meal after next , i &apos;ll pay for everybody .
what do you mean , meal after ... why meal after next ?
how &apos; bout that ?
catherine just clearly said she &apos;s paying for this meal .
right ?
catherine .
where &apos;d she go ?
putz .
she just said it , danny .
catherine !
mele kalikimaka .
ho ho ho .
ho ho ho !
huh ?
yeah !
weight down . weight down . whack it in .
come on . let &apos;s go .
everybody goes completely nuts .
the entire east coast loses their mind . huh ?
hey . practice .
please be careful , all right ?
what &apos;s up , buddy ?
merry christmas .
merry christmas , danny .
what are you doing here ?
i couldn &apos;t sleep .
oh . what , uh ... what &apos;d you find out ?
i recovered a hair from inside the locket .
extracted dna and ran the profile
against a database the japanese police
set up to help identify victims of the tsunami .
what &apos;d you find ?
the little girl in the photo was six @-@ year @-@ old akiko tanaka .
she lived with her family in ishinomaki ,
one of the towns hardest hit by the tsunami .
i contacted the girl &apos;s father ,
the family &apos;s only survivor .
he was away on business when the quake hit .
tried to get back in time ,
but was forced back by the wave .
when the water receded ,
it was all gone :
his wife , daughter , house .
his whole life was wiped out in a matter of minutes .
you , uh ... you said you spoke to this guy .
where @-@ where is he now ?
