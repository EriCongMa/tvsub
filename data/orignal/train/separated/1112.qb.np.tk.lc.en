hey .
hey .
do you have plans this weekend ?
i &apos;m thinking we should talk about the homework assignment .
i know that you &apos;re not crazy about having me for a lab partner .
it &apos;s okay .
any guy at this party
would be happy to be with me .
we &apos;ve already talked about this , okay ?
why are you taking sean &apos;s car ? hanna !
and you will work off the cost of repairs
in sean &apos;s mother &apos;s office .
what &apos;s a golden orchid ?
it &apos;s a national competition for historical writing .
more academic bling for spencer .
i saw the way you were looking at my dad yesterday .
i have eyes .
find someone who &apos;s available .
my dad isn &apos;t .
mom ? there &apos;s something you should know .
somebody &apos;s been in the house .
小贱人们 -a
问问你女儿吧 她什么都知道
&quot; a &quot; sent this letter to my mom .
you know it &apos;s not your fault , right ?
it &apos;s your dad &apos;s mistake , totally .
no , it is my fault .
you did not hook up with her
and then ask your kid to cover for you .
ali said i should &apos;ve told my mom right after it happened .
ali ? alison knew ?
yeah , she was with me .
so , alison saw this meredith person ?
meredith ? her name is meredith .
ew . that &apos;s not even a cute @-@ girl name .
i &apos;m seeing big pores and mousy roots .
hanna , i think it &apos;s a little too soon to joke .
i &apos;m sorry , but if you &apos;re gonna cheat ,
you might as well do it with somebody
who deep @-@ conditions her hair occasionally .
here , put something in your mouth
besides your foot .
i &apos;m sorry . okay ?
look , all i &apos;m saying is that when my dad left ,
laughing sometimes helped .
so did crying .
my father hasn &apos;t left , guys .
i mean , this happened over a year ago .
you think he &apos;s gonna leave ?
look , whatever happens , we &apos;re here for you .
thank you guys for staying here .
i couldn &apos;t have been here alone .
when &apos;s your family getting back ?
this afternoon .
weren &apos;t you gonna clean off the mirror before they get here ?
want me to come with ?
we should all go .
uh , yeah , you know what ?
it doesn &apos;t take four of us to clean a mirror ,
so why don &apos;t you three go , and i &apos;ll just wait here .
fine . you stay down here .
alone .
but make sure you lock the door .
great . you spray , i &apos;ll wipe .
well , the creature &apos;s back .
we should &apos;ve never unblocked our phone .
open the attachment .
that &apos;s us !
was that shot from inside your closet ?
&quot; a &quot; was watching us !
guys .
check it out .
how do you not poke your eyeball ?
what &apos;s up ?
uh , nothing .
look , um ...
are mom and dad acting weird with each other ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a vibe .
yeah , maybe .
look , don &apos;t worry about it , okay ?
you &apos;re only gonna do one eye ?
is that a new cyclops look ?
listen , i can take them to practice if you want--
i can do it .
well , i &apos;m done by 3 : 00 .
i &apos;ll do it .
should we find someone to talk to ?
a counselor , therapist ?
you would feel more comfortable talking to a stranger
in some office than you would in your own kitchen ?
yeah , but we &apos;re not talking , ella .
are you done with this ?
see you later .
bye .
see ya .
all right , tell me what i need to do to make this better .
do you want me to move out ?
don &apos;t make that my decision .
well , do you think it would help ?
how ,
by making me deal with their confusion alone ,
or by making me the bad guy
that kicked their dad out ?
are they gonna be any less confused seeing
us walk around here like sulky roommates ?
we &apos;re not--
hey .
do you want some breakfast ? there &apos;s yogurt .
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m good with a granola bar .
i &apos;m going to , uh , going to go to work .
i &apos;ve got office hours .
hey , good luck with that french test , sweetheart .
look , mike knows something &apos;s up .
are you gonna tell him ?
yeah . you know , when i can .
okay , well , just don &apos;t wait too long .
it was way too hard to keep it from you for a year .
i don &apos;t want to have to do that to him , too .
a year ? you &apos;ve known about this for a year ?
yeah . i thought dad ...
he didn &apos;t tell you that he asked me to-- ?
mom , i can miss first period
if you want to talk .
it &apos;s okay .
this is between me and your dad .
don &apos;t worry .
need some help ?
oh , hi . hey .
no , no , i got it .
um , stupid shoe .
my mom forgot to mention the new job required a uniform , huh ?
no , it &apos;s cool . i like it .
hideous looks good on me .
listen , i tried-- i know that--
sorry . what were you gonna say ?
i tried to take the fall for the car .
you did ? why ?
i felt really bad about
what went down at noel &apos;s party ,
so i told my parents i gave you the keys
and i &apos;d pay for the repairs .
no . no , i should pay for the repairs .
it was my fault .
besides , i think working in a dentist office
will help me with my fear .
scared of dentists ?
children .
your mom is making me hand out
sugar @-@ free lollypops to six @-@ year @-@ olds .
they don &apos;t bite at that age , do they ?
look , i know that we haven &apos;t talked
since that night ,
but since we are now ,
do you wanna talk about homecoming ?
i mean , do you still wanna go ?
you know , with me ?
i , uh , hadn &apos;t really thought about it .
coach has us on a lot of two @-@ a @-@ days .
that &apos;s a lot of pressure .
and with everything else going on , i just ...
yeah , no , i get it .
no , well , we--
we should . talk about it .
i gotta go . that &apos;s my ride .
you cannot seriously think
that a blind girl broke into my house .
that would take a lot more
than a talking gps .
well , i didn &apos;t say that jenna was alone .
let &apos;s no go to the toby place , okay ?
why not ?
you guys think her guide dog left behind his lipstick ?
yeah , do you want to ask
what your lab partner was doing last night ?
you know , maybe he took a break from sitting on his porch
pulling the heads off of squirrels .
spencer ! sorry ,
ladies , i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt ,
but i hope you &apos;re as proud of
your friend as i am .
congratulations .
my instincts were right .
this just makes it official .
what &apos;s that about ?
an essay contest .
wait , did you win it ?
aren &apos;t you gonna at least open the envelope ?
why should she ? she wins an award for waking up .
sodium borate .
easy . that glass beaker &apos;s made of ... glass .
maybe you should do it .
i &apos;ve had too much coffee and not enough sleep .
big party on a thursday night ?
no , i-- slept at a friend &apos;s .
what did you do last night ?
sat at the grill doing homework .
that &apos;s where you study ?
got to .
jenna listens to her lectures loudly ,
and it messes me up .
she doesn &apos;t like using her headphones at home .
why the grill ? it &apos;s not exactly quiet there , either .
it is if you stay late enough .
i close the place , like , every night .
so , whose house did you stay at last night ?
that new girl ?
who , maya ?
why would you think that ?
just figured that she &apos;s the newest member of your posse .
has she learned the secret handshake yet ?
she &apos;s ... more my friend than the group &apos;s .
why is that ?
she just cares about different things .
different &apos;s good . i like different .
this town has too much of the same .
hey , there .
hey .
i &apos;ve been thinking about you .
uh , how are things with your family ?
they &apos;re tense and getting worse .
can you give me an excuse not to go home ?
extra credit assignment
or six @-@ hour detention ?
um ... i &apos;m sorry , i actually can &apos;t stay late today .
uh , i &apos;ve got this ... thing .
oh .
well , no , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not a thing .
it &apos;s just a , um ... thing .
a reading of a story .
that i wrote .
you &apos;re reading it out loud ?
can i come ?
you can , but if it sucks ...
i &apos;m going to hurt myself .
you &apos;d be a witness .
it could get ugly .
you &apos;re the teacher .
i &apos;m the student , remember ?
do you like the color ?
thank you .
hey . those are for you .
butter creams .
they &apos;re your favorite , right ?
yeah , they were ... when i was , like , seven .
thanks , daddy .
so , you finally spoke to wren ?
no , but i spoke with mr. sheldrake .
you didn &apos;t really think you were gonna be able
to keep this essay secret , did you ?
spencer , this is a coup for you .
i mean , if the ivies weren &apos;t onto you already ,
they are now .
i &apos;m seeing a cage match between harvard and yale .
dad , it &apos;s really not that big of a deal .
oh , now you tell me .
your mother &apos;s already taken out a full @-@ page ad
in the club newsletter .
i &apos;m kidding . come on .
have a butter cream .
i &apos;m proud of you , spence .
at least let me brag about you tomorrow .
what &apos;s tomorrow ?
i &apos;m taking russell newhoff to the club .
he &apos;s a potential new client .
you up for playing doubles if he brings his daughter along ?
sure ! hey , you want to volley with me ?
oh , i &apos;d love to , but ...
i have a bunch of calls to return ,
and a prize @-@ winning essay to read .
don &apos;t forget to put it on my desk , okay ?
oh , dad , i-- you don &apos;t have to read this one .
it &apos;s really not one of my best .
somebody sure thought it was .
they don &apos;t give these awards to people who don &apos;t deserve them .
hello , dental office . just a minute , please .
hello ?
can i help you ?
no . no , i was just , um ,
looking for a place to toss medical waste .
must be a different floor .
thanks for your help .
i didn &apos;t think this would take so long .
i don &apos;t mind .
i like being in school when nobody else is .
viscosity , elasticity , and tensile strength .
anything else we need to cover ?
maybe our noses . this stuff &apos;s rank .
oh , god !
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s just water .
did you draw this ?
it looks just like the cover
from this band , circa survive .
this is so good .
you know that band ?
my cousin works at a bar on south street .
he snuck me into a show .
have you heard any of their new stuff yet ?
it &apos;s totally ...
amazing .
if-- if you &apos;re into them , there &apos;s this ...
other band i should turn you onto .
i &apos;ll bring you a cd .
thanks .
i should go .
i &apos;m gonna be late for swim practice .
um , emily ?
yeah ?
my notebook .
oh , jeez .
i totally need more sleep .
or more coffee .
wanna meet up at the grill later ?
sure .
&quot; and in an instant , her life was undone .
everything she &apos;d known disappeared ,
drifting into the summer sky . &quot;
thank you .
he doesn &apos;t suck , huh ?
you know this guy ?
yeah . he &apos;s my english teacher .
oh , very cool . me and him go way back .
we used to sleep together .
bunk beds ! college .
do you have a name , fangirl ?
oh , aria .
hardy .
what the hell are you doing here ?
well , i thought i &apos;d get some face time
with the president of your fan club , apparently .
you two know each other ?
yeah , well , not as well as you two know each other .
i , uh , i heard about the bunk beds .
we just met , but i &apos;m glad i sat next to her .
she kept kicking me so i wouldn &apos;t snore .
no , no , no , seriously ,
how did you know about this ?
i don &apos;t live in a cave .
i saw it on the website ,
thought it was my duty to come heckle you .
i think i should be in a cave .
was it really that bad ?
no , it was beautiful .
and that metaphor at the end ?
that was a metaphor ?
i thought it was really about a kid who lost her balloon .
you also thought &quot; chitty chitty bang bang &quot; was mexican porn .
that &apos;s true .
books aren &apos;t his thing , you know ?
he used to pay me in frozen burritos to write his papers .
you know what &apos;d be great is if you told this same lame story
while i had a beer in my hand .
i &apos;m grabbing a waitress .
i didn &apos;t know he was gonna be here .
good serve .
listen , hate to interrupt , be we &apos;re kind of closed .
i was supposed to shut down the courts ten minutes ago .
seriously ? can you just give me another five minutes ?
are you practicing for a tournament or something ?
no , um . no , it &apos;s just a friendly game of doubles
with my dad and some guests .
well , you and i have very different ideas of what &apos;s friendly .
that &apos;s an angry serve .
well , it &apos;s been a long week .
kind of been storing it up .
a strong slice is only half the battle .
you &apos;ve got to kill it on the return , too , you know .
well , i &apos;m just warming up .
so i hook up with her in the library ,
but you can &apos;t get serious
in the sociology stacks , right ?
so i take her back to my dorm room .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re telling this story .
let him finish . i want to hear .
she wants to hear !
so , i get her back .
you know , he &apos;s sound asleep , of course .
i get her shirt off , things are happening ,
life is good , and then this geek ,
right here , starts laughing in his sleep .
now , he &apos;s done this before , but this chick ,
she does not believe that he &apos;s asleep .
which i was .
you laugh in your sleep ?
mm @-@ hmm .
that &apos;s cute .
it &apos;s better than snoring .
right . uh , you were up .
ah , no . it &apos;s her turn .
take it for me . i &apos;m gonna grab some water .
dude , you are so screwed .
it--it &apos;s not what you think it is .
don &apos;t give me that look .
i didn &apos;t pursue this . it just happened .
and that makes it okay ?
hardy--
ezra , she &apos;s cute . she &apos;s smart .
i get it . there &apos;s no argument ,
but she &apos;s your student , man .
that &apos;s not how i met her .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
when this is all over , she &apos;s gonna get her diploma .
you &apos;re gonna get a pink slip and an orange jumpsuit .
okay , so how about this ?
the loser of the next game buys fries ?
sweet . give it up .
you in ?
thanks for this . i &apos;m having fun .
yeah , me too .
here you go .
here , i &apos;ll go .
sorry i &apos;m late .
boss got chatty when they dropped the check .
but i only ate one lamb chop .
the rest are yours .
what are we looking at ?
the worst part of my day .
you know , i thought it bottomed out
when a kid aimed at me for a rinse @-@ and @-@ spit ,
but now there &apos;s an amber .
what &apos;s an amber ?
amber is &quot; a cheerleader at rollins high
who loves skinny lattes . &quot;
here .
see for yourself .
she &apos;s cute .
she &apos;s trying to date sean .
she &apos;s evil .
we know this for a fact ?
well , she &apos;s suddenly become his personal driver
and god knows what else .
driving is not dating .
eat .
mom ! why are you feeding me
when my boyfriend left me
for someone who weighs 11 pounds ?
he hasn &apos;t left you . his car &apos;s in the shop .
so why can &apos;t he hitch a ride with someone who &apos;s not majoring in cartwheels ?
i am sorry that you don &apos;t have a car of your own to drive .
you have to talk to your father about that .
no , thanks .
besides , he &apos;s probably already picked one out for kate .
kate ? thought her name was isabel .
that &apos;s the mother .
the girlfriend .
the fiancee .
he &apos;s marrying her ?
yeah , i found that out
before i went to spencer &apos;s last night .
i didn &apos;t see you this morning ,
so i thought it &apos;d be kind of weird to text you .
yeah . that would &apos;ve been weird .
thanks .
still , i &apos;d rather hear it from you than from him .
i &apos;m not surprised . we &apos;ve both moved on .
try the baguette . it &apos;s delicious .
汉娜被甩了 艾米丽被亲了 -a
i saved it , just in case .
i &apos;m telling you ,
that &apos;s the lipstick jenna was putting on in the elevator .
are you sure ?
yes ! that &apos;s alison &apos;s color .
same shade , same tube .
what i &apos;m wondering is why was jenna
in an empty room for an hour ?
i think we should call the police .
there are fingerprints on this tube .
well , yeah , ours .
look , if we are not gonna answer any more questions ,
just let me get in the office and see what i can find .
have you gotten any more e @-@ mails ?
not since this morning . have you ?
no . i &apos;m just wondering .
emily !
hey , what are you doing here ?
uh , i was just
hanna had a run @-@ in with jenna marshall today .
sit down .
emily , you know that dentist office i &apos;m working at ?
well , i was going in for my shift after school ,
and i was in the elevator . jenna marshall was in there .
she had the same lipstick ali wore .
the exact same color .
she had the same lipstick as ali .
she had alison &apos;s lipstick .
she was putting it on .
so , are all college boys like the ones in that bar ?
is it possible to say hello to a guy
without putting them in a headlock ?
well , maybe when you go to college , you &apos;ll ...
find out for yourself .
okay , stop .
did hardy say something ...
about us or about me ?
no , why would he ?
i was just having fun at a bar
with a high school student .
you make it sound so awful .
well , maybe it is .
i mean , if you think about it--
well , why ?
was i acting like a high school girl ?
did i do anything to embarrass you ?
look , have i ever done that ?
no , it &apos;s not about that .
okay , then what is it about ?
i mean , is this hardy &apos;s problem ,
or is it yours ?
where did this come from ?
age is never an issue when we &apos;re together .
when it &apos;s just the two of us ,
but when we &apos;re out in the world , people notice .
no , hardy noticed .
look , he &apos;s your friend ,
and if you &apos;re okay with it ,
i really doubt it &apos;s gonna bother him .
aria , let &apos;s get real .
in theory , we are a lot more wrong than we are right .
you wanna be real ? forget about theory .
what does it feel like when we &apos;re together ?
good . it feels ... right .
i wanna be with you .
i wanna hang out in a bar ,
introduce you to my friends ,
split a plate of fries like everybody else ,
but i don &apos;t think we can do that .
when i &apos;m with you ,
i don &apos;t care about anybody else .
so , are you talking yourself into this or out of it ?
yes !
n @-@ no ! maybe .
so ?
let &apos;s review .
look , we &apos;re here now , and it &apos;s just the two of us
and it feels good .
so let &apos;s not care together .
where you going ?
i have an early tennis day with my dad ,
and i have no idea what i &apos;m gonna wear .
there , um , may be this boy--
boy ! what boy ? details !
well , there &apos;s none yet , but i &apos;ll keep you guys posted .
are you emily ?
no . em ?
someone left this for you .
pretty . who made that ?
somebody from school .
well , whoever made it must like you a lot .
no , we were just talking about
this band we both like .
is it from somebody you like back ?
sorry . you don &apos;t have to tell me anything .
but , em ...
if there &apos;s someone in your life
who cares about you , then i &apos;m happy for you .
no matter who they are .
bye .
wait .
you sure you have to go ?
yeah . yeah , it was so weird when i left home this morning .
i &apos;m not really sure what i &apos;m gonna walk into .
i liked having you here .
well , i didn &apos;t say i wasn &apos;t coming back .
what if i cook us dinner tomorrow night ?
oh , you cook ?
yeah . how do you feel about enhanced
macaroni and cheese ?
uh , frightened .
what do you mean by &quot; enhanced &quot; ?
well , it means i &apos;m cooking fettuccini ,
but i don &apos;t want you to get your hopes up .
hey , champ .
how was practice yesterday ?
good . i &apos;m ready to bury them .
heh , yeah . you know , about that .
you might want to keep it friendly on the court , okay ?
why does everyone think i &apos;m unfriendly ?
i &apos;m serious , spence .
turns out newhoff and his daughter
aren &apos;t exactly venus and serena ,
so just dial it back a bit .
but , dad ,
i was out there for five hours yesterday swatting balls .
well , good , then you &apos;ll hopefully be a little sore .
are you asking me to throw the match ?
spencer , i &apos;m asking you to just look at this
as a ... means to an end , okay ?
if he wins , i win . got it ?
easy !
ah , martha . you &apos;re here .
next time , just push the button .
excuse me ?
push the button . that tells me you &apos;re here .
okay .
since it &apos;s your first visit ,
there &apos;s some paperwork .
why don &apos;t you fill it out in my office ?
i &apos;m still renovating out here .
please , have a seat .
phillip said this was your first time .
you &apos;ll be fine .
let me grab a new patient file ,
and we can get started .
psychotherapy .
you &apos;re her therapist .
you just said her therapist .
martha , is there someone else joining us today ?
is everything all right ?
martha doesn &apos;t want therapy .
martha has to go .
okay , i told you something was up .
can you hear them ?
look , whatever it is , it &apos;s not about us .
how do you know ?
i just do .
look , go get your stuff . we &apos;ll go to the library .
we &apos;ll study there , okay ?
yeah , but for how long ?
just get your stuff .
she lives in this town .
i have to see her . i have to talk to her .
i befriended this woman .
ella , trust me .
it is over .
trust you ? !
she means nothing to me ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let her take away from me what matters most .
and what is it that matters to you ?
because clearly it is not us .
do you want me to find another job
teaching at a different college ?
do you want to pick up and move again ?
because i will . i &apos;ll do that .
is that what iceland was all about ?
yeah . in a way , it was ,
because i wanted things to be the way they used to be with us .
and how was that ,
me looking like a complete and total idiot-- because look at this .
look at this stupidly happy woman
standing next to her loving husband .
what am i supposed to do with all these family photos
of our romantic trip abroad ?
stop that ! stop it .
what happened with her was a mistake .
what i know is that
you used our daughter to hide this from me .
how could you do that to her ?
i don &apos;t even know who you are !
i panicked . i thought i didn &apos;t have another choice .
i was scared . i was afraid i would lose you .
you just might .
mission accomplished .
you have a question ?
no .
we &apos;ll meet you in the lobby , okay ?
did you waste your real game yesterday ?
what ? no , i was just off .
no , you weren &apos;t , not when the match started .
look , it &apos;s a long story .
and it was important for our guests to win .
and so the only way for you to do that was for you to lose ?
what &apos;s up with that ?
did your dad ask you to do that , or ...
look , he &apos;s not always like this .
whatever you say . i just-- i see a lot of it here .
lot of what ?
people playing games ...
just off the court , you know ?
yeah .
is there any chance you &apos;d want to hang out sometime ?
like , not here ?
yeah .
okay .
bye .
bye .
hanna , do you want these ?
i wore them once . they gave me a nosebleed .
i think they &apos;re a little too dressy for a dental office .
well , you &apos;ve got some events coming up .
what are you wearing to homecoming ?
mom , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m going to homecoming .
of course you &apos;re going .
if you &apos;re breathing , you &apos;re going .
what &apos;s up ?
you still haven &apos;t heard from sean ?
he said we &apos;d talk , but it hasn &apos;t happened ,
so i &apos;m just giving him space .
don &apos;t give him too much .
i tried that with your father .
he found a woman in maryland who graduated with honors
from william and mary
and loves to golf .
how do you know that ?
i googled her .
i &apos;m so sorry , mom .
no ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m the last person who should be giving anyone relationship advice .
i had too much pride to tell your father that i wanted him back .
and now ...
maybe you can wear these to his wedding .
on the links .
please tell me you have a really deep pan ,
and please tell me i left my phone here .
you did .
ezra .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i was trying to work and it kept buzzing .
i thought it was an emergency ,
your parents or something ,
i looked at it , um ...
just take it .
who &apos;s &quot; a &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know .
how many of your friends did you tell ?
i didn &apos;t .
cause if &quot; a &quot; knows ,
i &apos;m thinking &quot; b &quot; and &quot; c &quot; and everybody else knows , too .
the person who sent this is not my friend .
you told me you were mature enough to handle this .
do you know what would happen if the school board or anybody ...
i didn &apos;t tell anyone . you have to believe me .
well , i don &apos;t .
just go .
go !
now .
hey , there .
still looking for that trash chute .
uh , no , i left something at my desk this morning .
excuse me .
yeah .
how much does he want ?
for two tickets ?
i didn &apos;t pay that much to see lionel richie
when he was lionel richie .
hanna ?
hi .
are you , uh , working today ?
um , i didn &apos;t , yeah . what are you doing here ?
my mom left some insurance papers on the desk .
they won &apos;t release my car until ...
wait , you &apos;re getting it back ?
yeah , on monday .
so , you won &apos;t need anyone to drive you around anymore ?
you know , someone else ?
um , that &apos;s sort of the plan .
great !
well , um , i &apos;ll see you later .
all right .
see ya .
are we over ?
what ?
look , i &apos;d rather you just tell me now
before it &apos;s too late .
what &apos;s too late ? what are you talking about ?
if you want to take someone else to homecoming ,
sean , you should .
why would i do that ?
it &apos;s not like i &apos;d actually go with anyone else .
so what are you doing
with that skinny latte who drives you around ?
amber ? no , she just drives me to school for our meetings .
this club i joined .
r.l.w. stands for &quot; real love waits . &quot;
go ahead . make a joke .
is it some kind of holy @-@ roller virgin society ?
look , i just thought hanging out with other people
who feel the same way as i do
will make it easier to hold out , you know ?
no , i get it .
could i go with you to the next meeting ?
why ? you wanna join ?
well , we already tried doing it my way ,
so let &apos;s try now doing it your way .
excuse me .
don &apos;t tell me that &apos;s how you want to celebrate--
with a pear ? put that away !
you deserve a three @-@ course meal tonight .
think i &apos;ll pass .
pass ?
honey , you &apos;re the guest of honor .
you won a national award
and helped me sign newhoff ,
which almost didn &apos;t happen .
why , didn &apos;t i hit the net enough ?
no , you were perfect ,
but things almost fell apart
while you guys were in the locker room .
what happened ?
oh , well , he expected lunch at the club .
of course , i didn &apos;t make a reservation ,
so there were no tables .
we sat at your favorite table .
after i made a scene .
i had to tell the manager that
the kid on the courts forgot to call it in .
who , alex ?
wait , will he be in trouble over this ?
who cares ?
kid can pick up balls anywhere , right ?
we snagged a major client , spence .
why are you looking at me like that ?
just did what i had to do .
to win ?
don &apos;t give me that attitude .
spencer , you &apos;re just as driven and competitive as i am .
don &apos;t pretend you &apos;re not .
you know what ? you &apos;re right . i am .
i &apos;m just not sure it &apos;s a thing that i want to celebrate anymore .
and by the way , you don &apos;t have to read my essay .
why not ?
because i stole it .
but i &apos;m gonna win a big , fat award ,
so i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re okay with that .
you know , &apos; cause winning &apos;s all that matters , right ?
hey .
i was hoping you &apos;d be here .
why ?
i really like tracks three , seven , and nine .
nine was the best .
and i &apos;m sorry about last night .
really sorry .
what &apos;s that ?
something i made for you .
there are a couple girly songs ,
so you have to keep an open mind .
coffee , please .
hey .
hey .
you ready ?
yeah .
cool , then .
let &apos;s go .
okay .
what is this ?
dinner .
is mom still in her room ?
yeah .
and dad ?

i really don &apos;t know .
