Gossip girl here...
Your one and only source
Into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I really think we should cool things off for a while,
You know, take a... take a little break?
Well, we did say no strings.
Right.
No strings.
You either tell me the truth, or we're over.
I'm rufus and lily's son.
Georgina. Hey. I'll be there in a second.
Things were so much easier when we were younger.
We just jumped into things.
Why can't we just be more like that?
Marry me, Lily.
The next time you forget you're Blair Waldorf,
Remember I'm Chuck Bass, and I love you.
Scott, what's going on?
I haven't told you the truth.
I'm your son's brother.
If you're looking for the first excuse to bolt, trust me,
You're gonna find one.
I'm not looking for an excuse anymore.
I didn't really give you a chance to know both sides of me,
And I guess I'm wondering if you still want to.
I don't even know why I'm pretending to think about it.
Yes. yes, of course.
This is your fault.
That's not fair.
Not fair?
I go away to take care of my mother,
And I come back and my daughter is not going to college.
I'm headed home to face the family firing squad.
Considering what you did to us,
Being able to find you
Is gonna go a long way.
Go ahead and run if you want.
You know how much daddy loves to hunt.
Some say love is a river.
Some say love's a silly song.
Some say love is all around us.
It lifts us up where we belong.
Some say love is hearing laughter in the rain.
But on the upper east side,
We all know love is pain.
Toasted blueberry?
You spoil me.
Dorota offered to make eggs,
But I thought
It was the duty of the devoted lover to provide.
I missed you.
Yeah, you showed me
Just how much when I got in last night.
So how was your trip?
Did you get your money back from your poker buddy?
No. And I would have let it slide,
But with my parents cutting me off.
Trust me. I get it.
Working for K.C. is
Nowhere near as lucrative as being Lily Bass' daughter.
For now, toaster pastries are all I can afford.
So go.
Talk to her,
For me.
Fine.
But then you have to do something for me.
Take my place at dim sum with my friends.
Dumplings with Blair and Chuck?
And Nate. You can do some recon.
Blair hates Nate's new girlfriend.
You can find out if she's really that bad.
I bet Bree is perfectly nice,
Even though she is a Buckley.
Um, unfortunately,
I...I do have more, um, people
Who owe me money to talk to.
Fine.
Eat up.
One second.
I'm telling Olivia to say Hi to Godzilla from me.
Is funny, right?
More so than your awful sushi puns.
Well, I'm a terrible flirter,
But as long as Olivia's on this Asian press tour,
I have...I have no choice. And anyway, you know,
"Sashimi later" is charming.
Why are you using my screen name again?
Because every time i log on, Georgina pounces on my i.m.
I broke up with her.
I don't know how much more clear
About my feelings I can be.
You could tell her you're dating someone else.
We all live on the same floor, Dan.
When she gets back, she's gonna figure it out.
Point taken. I'll e-mail her later.
You talked to Scott at all?
I called him last week, but he hasn't called me back.
I guess he didn't like me that much.
Really? It didn't seem like that.
I'm sorry. I mean, I know you really liked him.
I did, too, actually, I guess,
Cause in a weird way. We were kind of related.
You know, I'm gonna hit the Bleecker.
Do...do you want a coffee?
No, no, no. You go.
Oh. The...the toilets in Tokyo talk.
Hi. Um, I'll have a nonfat latte.
Sure.
Hi. Did you miss me?
Georgina.
The bloodsucker is back.
I saw her coffin
And telltale Louis Vuitton broom on the floor.
Vampires don't ride brooms, Blair.
Leave it to georgina To start a mutant strain.
You know, my roommate and I
Didn't see eye to eye at first,
So one night I bought ice cream cone cupcakes
From the treats truck,
And we bonded.
She taught me how to say "hello" in Swahili.
Jambo.
Aw. Do you happen to know what the Swahili is
For "mind your own beeswax"? No reason, of course.
It just might be useful Someday on safari.
Blair, come on.
so, Bree, You went home last week?
Yeah. Tried to mend the I'm dating-a-Van-Der-Bilt-fence.
It didn't work.
We're southern, so family loyalty's really big down there.
Like slavery.
What? I'm joking.
You know i'm joking, Right, Bree?
So what's Serena doing? She still dating Baizen,
Or she come to her senses yet?
Carter Baizen? Is he in town?
I, I heard he was away on business.
He is. Traveling is so important.
Bree, have you ever thought about traveling...
Somewhere very far away?
I wasn't aware you knew Carter.
Yeah. Our families used to vacation together on sea island.
I've been trying to track him down.
You guys mind if I order for the table?
She was in Shanghai last year.
Nate doesn't like tofu when it's called bean curd,
And he hasn't eaten pork
since he saw "babe," with me.
Well, okay, um, I'll let you guys fend for yourself.
Hmm? If you'll excuse me.
Blair.
What?
I'll go apologize for my girlfriend.
So you're happy with Chuck.
Don't I deserve to be happy as well?
Trust me, Nate.
I know women, and none of us are that nice.
He'll be back soon.
He's in love.
You're looking for Carter?
The worm is dating my stepsister.
Look, if he's done something to you,
I need to know.
Any enemy of Carter's is a friend of mine.
I can't really talk about it,
But, uh, you should tell your stepsister to be careful.
Oh, and, If the worm pops out of the ground,
Let me know, okay?
That was, by far, your best wedding
The flowers, the foie gras.
Who would have guessed nine months later,
Klaus would have auf'd?
Well, the worst thing is I thought he would make me happy.
I thought all of them would.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to clear the air. I'm sorry.
I know that you're disappointed
that I'm not going to Brown,
And I know that you're angry that I left.
I'm not angry at you, Serena.
I should have been here, this summer
To help you with the decision instead of leaving you here
With yet another man who doesn't get it.
Mom, What are you talking about?
You and Rufus are the perfect couple.
Thank you for stopping by.
Hey, what's going on with mom and Rufus?
Oh, you didn't know?
They've been in a cold war since the day you left.
Over Brown?
Oh, on the surface, yeah, But I have a feeling
Mom's flipping out about other things, too.
Yeah, I think they could be in real trouble.
Dad, hey. What are you doing here?
I've been running.
You've been running with jeans on?
They didn't chafe?
If you don't mind,
I need to sleep in my own bed tonight...
Maybe longer.
Dan, hey.
Yeah, hey, listen. Um, I know that my dad and Lily
Have been having a rough go of it lately,
But, uh, things may have taken a turn.
He's spending the night here.
Oh, no.
They, they just need to sit down and talk,
Remind themselves of how much they love each other,
Before this gets any more out of hand.
I, I'm gonna figure out a way.
Okay? I, I promise.
Why won't he respond to any of my calls or texts,
Or my animated e-cards?
Are you serious?
The last one I sent him was
This adorable singing dog.
Okay, Dan didn't write you back,
Because "a," he broke up with you,
"b," he's seeing someone else,
And "c," even though I tried to defend you,
You're a full-on crazy person.
Wait. Can we go back to "b" for a second?
He can't be seeing someone else,
Because we just broke up and...
Okay.
Then you're gonna get Dan to dump her.
And why in the world would I do that?
I didn't visit my family last week. I was in Boston.
You know, I met the sweetest guy. I think you know him.
Scott Rosson?
Oh, my god.
He just had so much on his mind,
And after several glasses of wine, slightly enhanced,
You wouldn't believe what he told me.
What are you saying, Georgina?
Get Dan to dump the whore,
Or I'm gonna tell the whole world S cott's secret.
And that would be too bad, because "a,"
That's the last thing he wants,
"b," how do you think Dan's gonna feel
When he finds out you've known his brother's been alive for the whole time
And "c," who are you gonna hang out with
When all the humphreys hate you?
Should we review "b" again?
Some say love's a secret you keep sealed.
But to Georgina Sparks,
love's always a battlefield.
All right, so what's the emergency?
Dan, I hate to be the one to tell you this,
But according to the, uh, "star,"
Olivia's been spotted
All over Japan canoodling with... Orlando Bloom.
You know, I'm not...I'm not worried.
They're apparently very good friends.
So, uh, am I on speaker?
Also, uh, "us weekly" has her on baby bump watch.
Probably just bloat, but I thought you'd want to know,
Especially with the Orlando Bloom connection.
Right. Since when do you read gossip magazines?
They're Olivia's. She subscribes to both,
Which also speaks a lot to her character, don't you think?
Look, Vanessa,I don't believe that, obviously,
And...and neither do you,
So what are...what are you trying to tell me here?
I was thinking, don't you think that dating a movie star
Is gonna be kind of hard?
I mean, wouldn't you rather be with someone... from New York?
Who you have history with?
Look, I don't know if you're joking
Or if Lenny made brownies for your floor again,
But, uh, i'm...i'm kind of in the middle of something here,
So, uh, we'll talk later. All right?
Well, that was just pathetic. Haven't you ever tried
To get somebody to dump a celebrity before?
No.
That's okay.
Plan "b."
You're familiar with photoshop, I presume.
This is a great idea, guys. I needed some family time.
Let's order.
Uh, no, no. I'm still deciding.
Jenny, you've eaten the same thing here
Every time since you were 11. What's going on?
Well, if K.C. is texting you, You should go.
I will in a minute.
Well, the three of us can do family lunch anytime.
Some other...
You're kidding.
I knew I let you kids watch "the parent trap" too many times.
Y...it's time for you two to talk.
You love each other.
And it's not rufus' fault
That I made the decision not to to Brown
Could you please sit down for us?
Well, I do love the bolognese here.
I can't believe that actually worked.
I know. I'm a genius, which doesn't quite explain
Why I'll be spending the day reorganizing K.C.'s shoe closet.
Gotta go.
Carter is not who you think he is.
And I know you don't like to discuss this,
But he wasn't the cause of my spiral, just a symptom.
And he makes Serena truly happy.
What is this? It's incredible.
Buntautuk. I learned it from a master in chiang mai.
Serena's deluded.
The guy's not capable of genuine feelings.
He's brought out a different side of her.
They're all happy and domestic,
Nested up at my mother's. Ohh!
Carter's at your penthouse?
Why wouldn't you tell Bree that when she asked?
He got in last night.
She just called me a couple hours ago.
Anyway, why would I tell that future nascar mom anything?
I hate her, and the tractor she rode in on.
What you hate is Nate moving on.
Look, I love you,
But Nate liking Bree doesn't make her a piranha,
And Serena liking Carter doesn't make him a prince.
Hey. Where you going?
I have tension.
So maybe I'm crazy, but I think Vanessa is
Trying to get me to break up with Olivia.
Ooh. Evidence?
No, it...it was this tabloid magazine thing.
And then she gave me this whole speech about how she thought
I should be with somebody I share history with, you know?
Oh, mystery solved.
Uh, yeah. Duh. I mean, everyone in the state
Knows how she feels about you.
That's...no, come on. No, that was...that was years ago.
That can't be...
Come on, Dan. Have you ever seen a romantic comedy?
This is the scene right before you chase after her
And tell her that you can't believe how blind you were this whole time
You really like Olivia, though, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Then you better tell vanessa that.
Do you remember that night at Amherst?
We just opened for sonic youth,
And it was pouring rain,
And we couldn't bear another night in the van.
Oh, and we sprung for a room in that quirky little inn.
The skylark.
You remember.
Of course I do. They served us wine
In "welcome back, kotter" mugs.
I swiped Horshack for you.
Yeah.
That was a perfect night.
It was.
I know we talked about the Pierre,
But an inn like the skylark
Might be a cool place to get married in.
No offense,
But you've already done the fancy wedding thing...
A few times.
Don't you want to do something more <i>us?</i>
Well, yeah, that's great, Rufus.
I'm sure that mayor bloomberg would feel perfectly comfortable
Toasting us with
A freddie "boom-boom" washington cup.
That is so you, not us.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize the mayor was coming.
I've never even met the man.
Well, there are certain expectations
That come with being Lily Bass.
You do understand that, don't you?
Maybe I don't, because every time we get to a good place,
I do or say something that makes you angry.
Well, that's because you can't compromise.
You know what?
Maybe we aren't ready to talk.
Maybe we're not.
Oh, my god.
Dan. Oh, my god. What are you doing here? I can explain.
You know what? It's okay. It's okay. You can tell me.
All right? I'm your best friend. I can handle it.
You're my best friend, too, but I don't think I can.
You know what? I know anyway. I mean, I think I've known
Deep down inside for a couple months now.
You know, the way you broke up with Scott...
Yeah, I had to.
The tabloid thing and the way you were weirded out
By me hanging out in the hamptons. It's alright.
What? How does that have anything to do with...
But I gotta be honest, you know. I really like Olivia.
Whoa, whoa. Dan, you're really off base right now.
And I mean, you know, I've always cared about you, always.
Stop. Stop.
I'm not in love with you, you moron.
Georgina's been blackmailing me.
What? Why?
Vanessa. Vanessa, look, I'm your best friend.
You can tell me. You have to tell me.
What does she have on you?
She knows that I know...
Scott...
Is your brother.
Rufus?
Lily, where are you?
Where are you?
I'm at the loft.
I-I came to apologize.
I don't know why I got so crazy.
You were right. I am never really gonna understand
This world I am now a part of,
But that doesn't stop me from loving you.
It never has.
I love you, too.
Well, we can keep asking each other if we can do this.
We can keep planning and talking
And adjusting and talking some more,
Or we can just leap.
So let's leap. Let's get married.
We're already getting married, Rufus.
I mean soon. I mean tomorrow.
We leap.
Oh, my god. Yes. We leap.
Put on those dancing shoes,kids.
Looks like we're going to the chapel.
The Whitney is a no, Harvard club a no
And Colicchio laughed in my face
When I asked about craft.
The only time I want to hear "no"
Is if Ruth Madoff wants an invite.
Constance crew, what have you got?
My sister's a florist. She can handle the flowers.
Great. We've got cake. My aunt owns a bakery.
She said she found a "cancellation."
Oh, I'm sorry. My family's in investment banking.
They're all broke.
Then you can go.
Dorota.
I call the sonic youths.
They in north Hampton, will try to make it.
Acceptable. Hey, Jenny, you okay?
You've been working on that dress all night.
Yeah. It's like my own "project runway" challenge.
Wow. This is really happening.
Are you sure you don't need any help?
For once, don't worry about any of the wedding details.
You work on getting married. And write those vows.
Oh, I just finished.
Then let me hear them.
Yeah. Yeah, aunt Irene. So I'll...I'll see you then?
Okay. Yeah, the socks fit perfectly. All right. Bye.
Don't make me do this.
You know it's only a matter of time before georgina spills.
Yeah, that's exactly why we should tell my Dad.
Dan, this was your idea.
Lily and your Dad are too precarious right now.
This is their wedding day. You can't drop a bomb like that.
You're gonna have to hold Georgina off for one more day.
You can do this. Be strong.
Okay. Just, um, remind me later to kill you, please.
Hey, Dad, listen. So I gotta go out for a couple of hours,
But I will be back as soon as I can.
It's my wedding day. Where are you going?
You don't want to know,
But it's absolutely, absolutely important. I promise.
"And watching the sun set over the ocean
"In santa cruz that day,
I knew that Rufus Humphrey
Was meant for me."
Mom, are you kidding me?
Those could be the exact same vows you wrote for klaus.
You substituted lederhosen for doc martens
And nice for santa cruz.
No, they couldn't.
Oh, god. I'm terrible at this.
What do I say?
This wedding isn't like your others.
You're marrying Rufus... your soul mate,
The love of your life...
Talk about that and your futures together,
What you'll do, all that kind of stuff.
God.
Serena, I just got off the phone with the mayor's office.
He's agreed to expedite permits.
Rufus and Lily can get married
At the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
It's perfect. Okay, what are we waiting for?
Amalia, new mean girls,
Go to the garden and get to work.
Blair, you're on whip-cracking duty.
I'll deal with the caterers.
Mom, just please work on those vows.
Okay.
I'll handle everything else.
Wow. I wondered what happened to Poppy.
I had no idea it was that easy to get someone deported.
That's...that is, um, that's...that's so thoughtful.
That's so Georgina.
Uh, you know, I really missed you while you were away.
You did?
I-I heard you were seeing someone.
I was. But she...it turns out
She was dating Orlando Bloom behind my back. Can you believe that?
No.
Yeah.
Huh. It is amazing how down that guy's star-o-meter has gone.
I shouldn't have been with someone like that.
You know, there's...there's no... there's no history there.
In fact, I was thinking
That maybe we could hit the reset button on us.
You know, like go on a date, something like that.
Really?
You want me to be your date at your dad's wedding today?
I-I read about it on "gossip girl."
Uh, y-y-you know what? That's kind of a...
It's a private event. It's small.
Uh, so tomorrow.
Oh. Yeah. Okay. Uh, that...that works.
Great.
Yeah, okay.
What does it mean
When someone used to grab your ass
But now doesn't?
It means that someone's a big fat liar.
How is my favorite bridesmaid?
Working my butt off, but happy. You're coming, right?
I wouldn't miss you in something pink and poofy.
I'm serious. I know you've been avoiding my friends.
But this is my mother's wedding. It's important.
I know.
You can't hide from them forever.
Chuck is prickly.
I'll be there,
And I'm not afraid of Chuck.
I wouldn't pull out the suit quite yet.
I've spoken to Bree Buckley.
She told me everything.
Did you tell her where I was?
I told her
There's a certain wedding at the garden
That she and her family wouldn't
want to miss.
you are setting me up.
No, I'm giving you a choice.
You can go to the wedding
And tell Serena the ugly truth.
Even if by some chance she can stomach you after that,
You still have to deal with Bree, her family...
And a little thing I like to call southern justice.
Or?
I'm getting sick of being your travel agent.
This ticket's the last,
And it's one-way.
Georgina, hey.
Wow. uh, so how'd everything go with Vanessa?
Does she, uh, does she even want to see me?
You know what? We're going to go surprise her right now.
Let's buy you a tie.
Looks like this wedding song
Just became "stormy weather."
Don't worry. Here comes the sun.
The Sonic Youth's stuck in traffic.
It's okay, Dorota.
But next time,
Remember, Mr. Chuck has a chopper.
Hey, have you seen carter?
I haven't been able to reach him on his cell.
Its' still early. He'll be here.
Go. Flit. Mingle.
I'll keep an eye out. Don't worry.
I'm so glad you invited me, Nate.
Well, I'm just glad Blair didn't scare you off.
What, are you looking for someone?
No, no, I'm just taking it all in.
It's perfect. It's the perfect location, the perfect weather.
Eric, it's the perfect wedding.
I know.
Carter is more than fashionably late, and it better be
Because he's lost his keys or he got hit by a pedicab,
And not because of something you did.
Trust me. Serena's life will be much better without Carter,
Which is why I offered him an easy way out.
I don't care what Bree Buckley told you.
Carter's a new man with Serena,
And this is her mother's wedding.
He won't miss it.
Well, we'll see who is right.
In the meantime, I'm going to get a canap?
I nearly choked.
She shoved her tongue right down my throat.
I-I did some great acting, though.
Totally pulled it off.
It'll be worth it
When you see them family happily married.
You're right. You're right, right?
I hope so. I'll see you soon.
Try not to worry.
Oh, Jenny, it's gorgeous.
Thanks.
You know, Lily,
It wasn't easy for me when my parents split up.
And, uh, it was even harder
When I realized my dad was in love with someone else.
But the truth is,
I've...i've never seen him happier
Than he is with you.
That is so sweet.
I-i can't wait for you to hear his vows.
They're...they're all about your future together,
And I don't want to spoil them,
But they're really beautiful.
Okay, I'm gonna go
But you look amazing,
And i'll see you out there.
Thank you.
Looks like I was right, and you were wrong.
Hey, you okay?
No.
And you might not be either
When you hear what I have to say.
A few months before we left to search for your dad,
I, uh,
I ran up some gambling debt.
I owed a lot of money to some scary people.
And then I met this woman...
Beth.
She was shy, kind,
And, well, she... Fell in love with me,
And I saw an opportunity.
She had money?
Her family did,
And I knew they'd take care of my debts
If... It looked like I was about to be one of them,
So... I proposed.
The wedding was all planned,
And she had her dress, flowers.
And i...
Nearly went through with it, But i...
I didn't love her.
So what, you...you just disappeared?
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
You buy this girl a ring.
You tell her you love her.
What...what,
Did you make her breakfast in the morning, too?
Serena, it's...it's not the same.
Carter, I have to go.
My mother's getting married right now.
I've been looking all over for you.
Geor-georgina, hey.
What a...what a great surprise.
Uh, I thought our date was tomorrow.
It is. I just stopped by
To give Lily and Rufus a wedding present.
Hey. What was that about?
You look beautiful, Lil. Come on.
Can we just talk for a second?
I don't get it. E-e-everything came together for today.
I'm sorry. I can't write my vows.
I mean, how could I? When we don't agree
On how to raise our children or how to get married
Or anything?
What happened to taking a leap?
But the stakes are too high.
Ah, the wedding march.
Here comes the awkward pause.
Uh, uh, I'm sorry, everyone.
There's been a slight delay.
I'm sure there's just a tear in her hem or something.
I'll...i'll check and I will be right back.
Looks like the wedding dress might have a runaway train.
I-i can't believe you. You want to know
What our future looks like, Lily? It looks like this.
We are going to fight.
We're...we're gonna want To kill each other sometime.
That's what marriage is about...
Not running away from every little problem...
Sticking it out.You know, committing.
Do you think you can do that or not?
I, uh... I don't think I can.
Wait. So you're not getting married?
Scott? What?
Who are you?
This is a private conversation at a private event.
How dare you?
What, do you know him?
Oh, uh, uh, yeah, that was...
Your love child. Yeah, not dead.
Congratulations. It's a boy.
Ooh, ooh, love child.
Things didn't get any easier.
Might have to move the honeymoon suite
To the heartbreak hotel.
Wait. Wait. What was she talking about?
Don't believe her. Georgina is a liar.
What is she even doing here?
Our son is dead, isn't he? Isn't he?
Yeah, of course he is. That was, uh, Scott Rosson,
Andrew's brother.
You know Andrew's brother?
Or that's at least what he told me.
Dad, dad, dad. Lily... Um,
Scott, um, Scott is your son.
I'm so sorry. I was gonna
Tell you after the wedding.
I-i found out just yesterday.
Scott is...
How is that possible?
The rossons lied to you.
Andrew wasn't your son.
Scott is. He wasn't ready to tell you.
I have to go find him.
Vanessa, Where do you think he went?
He's probably headed back to boston.
He takes the chinatown bus.
I'm going to find him.
Well, I'm coming with you.
He's our son.
We're doing this together.
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Will you just leave?
Please. I-i need some time.
Just so you know, I told you what I told you,
Because it's not the same with you.
I really do care about you, Serena,
So much.
Hey, Carter.
You remember my cousin Beth's Brothers, right?
Played defensive line For Arnett Mead?
I'll be at the downing tonight.
We can't do this here.
They'll be watching you.
What? It's not like somebody else is gonna eat this now.
Mmm. Hey, guys. Great wedding, huh?
Look, Rufus, we just drove around the entire block.
He's not here. Vanessa was wrong.
The bus for boston leaves in eight minutes.
So he could still come. You know, he could be anywhere.
Let's go back to the bus stop.
But, uh...
What are you doing? Let's go.
But what's the point?
The point is we can still find him.
Well, and if we do, after What...after what I just did,
I...what am I supposed to say to him?
That we're his parents And that we're here for him
And that love can fix things.
Oh, we both know that's not true.
You know what? I don't.
You...what Scott saw
Was you grasping at anything you can to push me away.
That is not true.
First it was serena and brown,
Then the mugs and the mayor,
Then it's that you can't see the future.
Well, I'm scared of the future.I'm scared of a lot of things.
You're scared Because you're in love with me
Like you've never loved Any of your husbands.
And unlike a bart bass,
someone Like me can break your heart,
And that's terrifying.
And I know that, because right now you're breaking mine.
Scott?
Scott.
Scott.
S-stop. This was a mistake.
Don't say that.
All my life, I wondered about my real parents.
When I found out that They were you and lily,
That you were back together And you were getting married,
I guess I hoped that i'd find out that you gave me up
'Cause you weren't ready,
Not 'cause you didn't love each other.
Look, the difference is now I know we both want you,
Need you in our lives. Sure we got our problems,
But lily and I love our children,
And despite what you just saw, We love each other.
He's right. He's the best father
And the best man I've ever known.
Uh, I am scared,
Because marrying you
Means finally giving myself a real partner,
My children a real father,
And...
Finally...Letting myself truly love.
Lily.
I'm sorry, Rufus.
And I'm sorry, Scott...
That this is how you had to meet me,
Because all I thought about For the last 20 years is...
Holding our child in my arms.
Please give us a chance.
A family reunited, and it feels so good.
And I promise to eat caviar
Without spitting it in my napkin
When we go to dinner at mayor Bloomberg's,
Uh, as long as he knows when he comes to our house,
He's eating my chili.
Lily and, rufus, um,
I know that our future
Will be just like us...
Flawed and fragmented
And full of more love
Than I ever thought possible.
I am so excited for you to be my husband...
And for our children,
All of them...
To be my family.
Well, By the power vested in me
By a sketchy service on the internet...
I pronounce you husband and wife.
Okay, we get it. Enough.
Congratulation. I'm so happy for you.
Thank you. Where is Carter?
Oh, he...he went home. He wasn't feeling well.
You know all I want is for you to be happy, right?
Look, I have to admit, If you were at brown,
This wedding probably never would have happened,
So thank you.
Of course.
And I really am so happy you finally found the right man.
You're very lucky.
I love you.
I love you.
Sorry for not telling you Who I was.
You know what?I should have guessed.
No one under 40
Has ever shown That much interest
In lincoln hawk.
See, I told you. He has my nose.
Uh, maybe, but those are my eyebrows.
So, scott, what do you think about board games?
Love them.
Fantastic.
So hey, uh, vanessa texted.
She said she's sorry She couldn't make it back here.
I just...
I just wish I didn't put her in the middle of all this.
Vanessa is an all's well that ends well kind of girl.
She'll be fine. You thinking about sticking around?
Nah,i have to go back to boston,
My family,figure my life out.
Lily said there's an open invitation.
I'll definitely take her up on that. Maybe the holidays.
I'd love it.I'm sure vanessa would, too.
Come here.
Hey.
I've been looking for you.You okay?
Not really.
Carter told me some stuff,
And it turns out,
He's not the person I thought he was.
The person he is...
I... I-i don't really want to know.
Look...
I may loathe the guy,
But he didn't have to own up to anything.
He could have skipped town.
I even bought him a ticket.
He risked a lot going to the wedding,
Knowing Bree would be there.
What, the girl he was engaged to was a buckley?
He must really care about you.
Do you think the buckleys would actually hurt him?
They clearly want revenge.
I talked to blair.
So is it true?
You used me to get to carter?
Yeah...
I guess I did.
Come on, nate.
You're a van der bilt.
I'm a buckley.
And as much as I like you,
That's always gonna come first.
It's in my blood.
It's Texas.
If it means anything,
I'm sorry.
No. No. You know what? It doesn't...
So please leave.
Carter, hey.
I just talked to chuck.
I just want to make sure you're okay.
Call me, please.
I want to talk to you.
Well, it took 20 years,But we finally made it.
Well, I wouldn't have done it any other way.
This would be a perfect night
Except for the fact that Georgina got away unscathed.
I wouldn't be too certain about that.
I couldn't help but notice you.
I am prince Alexi from Belarus.
Nice to meet you, prince.
I am flying back to my home country right now
To celebrate my new oil pipeline.
Any chance you want to join?
You know, I'm pretty much over college,
And, uh, well, who am I to say no to a prince?
Wonderful.
There are songs that make us want to dance
Songs that make us want to sing along
But the best songs are the ones that bring you back
To the moment you first heard them
And once again break your heart
