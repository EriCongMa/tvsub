第七集
Where's Peter?
He wasn't the wolf.
Me?
Be careful. You almost shattered my wolf thing, Billy.
I'm sorry, Ruby, but look. It's fine.
Tell me about this.
It's the hat that pulled your loved ones away.
There's magic here now. There have to be ways to follow 'em.
Without fairy dust to guide us, it's hopeless.
Family is everything, my dear.
Charming could've been that hope for me,
But instead, he made my suffering worse.
He must know pain-- my pain.
Pickaxes down, brothers!
First round at Granny's is on me!
Come on, Leroy. We're gonna miss happy hour.
Granny's running a two-for-one special on mead.
Just 'cause it's called "Happy hour," Happy,
don't mean you gotta be there.
We got work to do.
But you're tired. We all are.
A break could help.
Charming asked us to mine for dust--
Fairy dust--
to help bring Snow and Emma back home,
And that's...
what I'm...
gonna do!
Where is it?
Are those...
Diamonds.
They're back.
The magic brought them back.
You mean the kind that become fairy dust?
Indeed. We just need to refine them, grind them up.
Do you still have what remains of Jefferson's hat?
You lock this up. Keep it safe.
Because by this time tomorrow,
we'll have enough magic dust to make it work again.
So Mary Margaret and Emma--
That's right, kid.
We're bringing 'em home.
Cheers!
To the dwarfs!
That's quite a spill. Are you okay?
I've had worse.
A mouse.
What? Where?
No.
I meant me.
I was a mouse.
My name was Gus.
I lived in Cinderella's pantry.
I ate cheese, I gnawed on wood,
but I preferred the cheese.
And why are you telling me this?
Uh, we haven't had a chance to talk since things... changed.
I just wanted you to know who I was... back home.
Uh, can I, um, still call you "Billy"?
You can call me whatever you want,
as long as you let me buy you a drink after your shift.
I already know Ruby.
I want the chance to meet Red.
Um, tonight's actually not great.
Because--
Uh, we, uh, we have, uh, plans.
That's right.
Um, its girls' night. I'm bringing the cheese,
which has nothing to do with you being a mouse.
It has to do with the... wine.
Okay. Um... maybe next time.
Thank you.
I can spot a girl in trouble.
He--he seems really nice.
It's--it's complicated.
Is that coffee?
No.
Trying to stay up, huh?
Still worried about those nightmares?
Well, don't be.
'Cause when you go to sleep tonight,
I'm gonna be right in the next room.
Now maybe lose the java
and go grab a cocoa.
Congratulations...
Sheriff.
Quite a celebration.
What are you doing here?
You may have taken care of me in the old world,
but in this one, we get another go at each other.
Whenever you're ready.
It's a big moment for you, isn't it?
On your way to getting your family back.
Yeah.
Yeah, it must be hard for you,
you know, watching good win.
Good?
So sure of yourself.
But I know the truth.
You're still just a shepherd pretending to be a prince.
You weren't fit to run the kingdom,
and you sure as hell aren't fit to run this town.
I think the people of Storybrooke might disagree with you.
Today.
But I'm gonna see to it that they see things my way,
that they see you for who you really are.
By the time I'm done with you,
you'll wish you'd killed me when you had the chance.
Oh. The people of this town know who I really am,
and they've seen me defeat you before.
So if you want to try and take me down,
they'll see it again.
Almost done.
Let's finish clearing out those perishables.
What the hell is this?
We're making a cage.
Know anybody who might want 38 frozen lasagnas?
I'm sorry. What?
I know.
Nobody would believe it if you told them my lasagna was frozen.
No. Why are you building a cage?
Tonight's the first full moon since the curse broke.
It's the first night of wolfstime.
I thought you figured out how to control the wolf in you ages ago.
Yeah, but thanks to the curse, I haven't turned in 28 years.
I might be rusty.
I can't let what happened last time--
What happened to Peter-- happen to anyone else.
What about your red hood? That could keep you from turning.
If I had it. I've looked everywhere.
I even went to Gold.
It's not in town. I don't think it came over with the curse.
Ruby, I know you.
I trust you. Snow trusted you.
Wolfstime or not, you won't hurt anyone tonight.
Maybe.
But I can't afford to take any chances.
Oh, I think we lost them.
Snow, wait. Wait!
You can't run from the queen, Snow White.
Come on. There are more of them.
Right this way!
Up the ridge!
It's okay. They're gone.
She's never going to stop, is she?
My hood--it's torn.
You have to go. You have to get away from me.
I'm not leaving you.
There's a full moon tonight. Wolfstime is beginning.
This hood is the only thing that can protect me from turning.
It's just a tear.
Maybe it'll still work.
What if it doesn't?
You saw what I did to Peter.
This thing--the wolf--
When it takes over me, I can't control it.
Please, Snow, find shelter.
I'll go further into the woods and find a place to hide.
For your own sake, we have to split up.
All right.
Just for tonight.
Let's meet up in the morning by the stream,
and then we'll find a safe place for both of us.
Maybe a nice cabin in the woods.
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Being so... kind to me.
You saw what I did as a wolf,
what I am.
I know that's not who you really are.
We're in this together, Red.
Are you awake yet, Ruby?
Ruby, Ruby.
Ruby!
Help!
Help!
Who are you?
Where are we?!
Henry? Henry, wake up.
It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay.
Wh-wh-what are you doing here? Where's David?
He got an emergency call this morning,
and he asked me to look after you.
He told me you've been having nightmares.
It's okay. You can--
Is that a burn?
This way.
Over here.
Ruby.
Ruby, wake up.
Where am I? What happened?
You're in the forest.
You must've fallen asleep here last night.
I don't understand. You put me in that cage. You locked me up.
The freezer was torn to shreds
when I came to check in on you this morning.
Ruby. Ruby, it's all right.
No. It's not.
I don't remember anything from last night.
This is exactly what I was afraid of.
Oh, my god. Did I do something last night?
Ruby, all we know for sure is that
you broke out and ran through the woods.
There's no reason to assume the worst.
Sheriff.
Yeah.
Okay. I'll be right there.
What is it?
Somebody left their car double-parked in front of the cannery.
I gotta go check it out on our way back into town.
Hey. Relax.
Everything's gonna be okay.
It worked.
Looking for this?
No. Don't. Please.
I need that.
This old thing?
Just
What could you possibly need this for?
Drop it!
Unless...
it protects you from something.
What are you talking about?
You think I don't know a wolf when I see one?
How do you know what I am?
Because I know how to recognize a child of the moon.
You-- you're one, too?
Name's Quinn.
I picked up on your scent last night.
You never had anyone talk to you about this, did you?
Teach you about what you are?
My parents were killed by hunters when I was a baby.
I was raised by my granny.
And she kept the truth from you.
Made you wear that.
Still blacking out, right?
Still losing control when you turn?
Probably even hurt someone.
I know how you feel.
I've been there.
But it doesn't have to be this way.
What do you mean?
What if I told you there was a way to control it
so you never have to be afraid of what you might do again?
Is that possible?
Follow me.
Is this some kind of trick?
Used to be the grand hall of a castle,
until it sunk underground.
Now it's all ours.
Are they...
Yes.
We are all the same.
Come. Anita is expecting you.
Wh-who's Anita?
That would be me.
Well done, Quinn.
You finally found her.
You've grown so much.
You know me?
I'm your mother.
That's Billy's truck.
Great.
Who do I call to tow a tow truck?
What is it, Ruby? What's wrong?
I smell blood.
Where's Billy?
Here.
Oh! It was the wolf!
It was me!
Oh, yes.
You were quite right to call me.
So y-you can help?
It was just a dream.
Well, what you're describing's certainly not a dream.
Then what was it?
A side effect.
You know, it's remarkable you'd cast a curse
you know so little about.
My victims are not supposed to wake up.
So I certainly never cared what happened to them after.
Until now.
When people fall under a sleeping curse,
the soul travels to a netherworld
where it resides until awoken.
Now this world is between life and death,
and it's very real.
However...
even when the curse is broken,
sometimes in sleep,
the victims find their way back to that world--
victims like you.
This other world is tormenting my son every time he sleeps.
I want you to give him something
that will keep him from going there.
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible.
I can, however, provide you with something
that will allow him to control his actions
whilst in that world.
And once one controls something,
one no longer need fear it.
A necklace?
You wear this while you're sleeping.
Once you control the journey,
the fear will stop.
And then you can come and go as you please.
Everything comes at a price with you.
What do you want for this?
For a house call?
You couldn't afford it.
But this is for Henry.
This one's on me.
It had to be something else, Ruby.
No, I did this! We both know it.
No. A few months ago,
everyone thought Mary Margaret was guilty of murder.
She needed someone to believe in her. I didn't do that.
I am not gonna make the same mistake with you.
Mary Margaret never killed anyone.
I have.
I know who you really are, Ruby,
even if you've lost sight of it.
It doesn't change the fact that I am gonna turn again tonight,
and somebody else could get hurt.
Maybe this isn't the place to have this discussion.
It's okay. I'll protect her.
No!
Lock me up.
If the freezer couldn't hold me, maybe a jail cell will.
I don't need to be protected from other people, David.
Other people need to be protected from me.
Granny lied to me.
That story about you being killed by hunters...
She's been lying to you ever since she stole you away from me
when you were just a baby.
Why would she do that?
Because she didn't want you to find out the truth about who you really are.
She believed the wolf is something to be ashamed of.
I see things differently.
Humans want us to believe we're the monsters.
The moment you believe them--
that's when you become one.
You're not the first
to learn the truth about yourself through tragedy.
So many of us spent so much of our life suppressing the wolf.
They have no idea how to control it.
They just need help--
Help embracing their true nature.
The only way you will ever control the wolf
is by accepting it as a part of you.
You can teach me to do that?
Indeed I can.
How?
You can start by getting rid of that.
You'll be safe in here tonight.
Thank you, David.
Thank me in the morning.
By then, I'll have found whoever really killed Billy.
You already have.
That thing. That she-wolf.
Get out.
Whatever issues you have with me don't involve her.
There's no proof Ruby had anything to do with what happened.
It seems to me
that you're allowing your emotions to cloud your judgment.
Leave him alone.
Protecting your friend at the peril of everyone else.
I knew you'd slip up, shepherd.
It was only a matter of time.
What do you want?
Justice.
Hand that over to me and let the town decide her fate.
Never. I know exactly what kind of justice you have in mind.
This town is bigger than you think.
I start telling people that you're putting their lives
in danger to protect your own interests,
you'll have a mutiny on your hands.
Yeah, we'll see.
You want her,
you have to go through me.
I look forward to that.
It'll be like nothing you've ever felt before--
The pine needles underfoot,
the air rushing over your fur,
your brothers and sisters at your side.
Your mind won't want to believe it.
It will tell you a wolf is invading your body,
trying to take over,
and if you believe that, for even a moment,
you'll black out...
and lose control,
like you have every other night you've turned.
But if you give in to the wolf,
you'll realize the truth.
You are the wolf.
And when you accept that,
you will finally be in control.
How much do you remember?
All of it.
You finally became the wolf.
I don't have to be afraid anymore.
We won't cower in fear of this creature any longer!
We know who she is. We know where she's hiding.
So why is she still alive?
Because she's being harbored by one person--
David Nolan.
How many more people have to die
before our prince decides to act?
Yeah!
If he won't protect you, I will.
Yeah.
These should work.
Thanks for letting her hide here.
The sheriff's station isn't safe.
Of course.
It's, uh, it's not every day you find out your friend's--
A monster?
Hunted.
I was going to say "hunted."
The crowd's six blocks from here.
You-- you have wolf hearing, too?
It's not all it's cracked up to be,
especially when you run a hotel.
The only way we're gonna get the mob to stand down
is if we prove Ruby had nothing to do with Billy's death.
I'm gonna need your help.
If the mob comes this way, call us. Come on.
What is it?
Hunters.
No! Don't! She's not here to hurt us!
What other reason do humans have for entering our den?
She's a friend
who stood by me after she learned the truth, after I killed.
Without her, I never would've escaped my village alive!
Let her go.
Oh, I'm sorry, Snow!
When you didn't show up at the stream this morning,
I thought the queen's men had killed you.
So...
Who are your friends?
We're her pack.
Are they--
Yes. They're like me.
But you don't have to fear them.
Of course not.
How did you find us?
I tracked wolf prints here, like you taught me.
You could've been caught by the queen's men.
I wasn't going to leave without you.
Why don't we go find that cabin we talked about, okay?
You're not coming with me, are you?
I don't have to be ashamed of who I am here.
I found my home.
I found my mother.
But I thought--
Granny lied.
I'm sorry, Snow.
I know you risked your life to come back here for me.
No. I understand.
I would do anything to be with my mother again.
I know we planned on leaving the kingdom together.
I'll be all right.
You've taught me enough already. I'll manage.
Bye, Red. Thank you.
No, thank you.
Quinn!
They found me.
Stand down or die at the hands of the--
Quinn, no.
He's gone.
You need to leave. The moon's gonna be up soon.
But will the chains hold?
Hopefully.
Then I'm staying.
Think of it as girls' night.
What's wrong?
I know David wants to believe the best,
but I've killed before, and I'll do it again.
Everyone in this town is right to be afraid of me.
Okay, well, I'm not.
You should be.
No matter what you might've done in your past,
David sees the good in you, and...
and that tells me one thing.
What?
That it's in there.
So if we can all see it, why can't you?
You really think so?
Trust me. I'm sort of an expert when it comes to rehabilitation.
Maybe.
Maybe you're right.
But the town's right, too. I am a monster,
and that's why I need to make sure I don't ever hurt anyone again.
No. No. Wh-what are you doing?
I can't let you stop me.
The mobs wants a wolf. I'm gonna give them one.
I need to pay for all I've done.
They'll kill you.
Isn't that what I deserve?
This way.
The trunk.
The wolf didn't kill Billy.
Ruby's hood.
So she'd be forced to change back into a wolf.
So whoever killed Billy could pin the murder on her.
Who would want to hurt my Ruby?
This isn't about Ruby. It's about me.
Spencer.
King George?
He needed a reason to wrestle power away from me,
so he created one.
She's out.
The mob. They're gonna kill her.
May you always run free beneath the moon's pale light.
Red, I'm so sorry.
You.
You did this.
What? No.
You brought the Queen's men into our den.
You have to believe me. I had no idea they followed me.
Mother, she didn't.
It doesn't matter.
Wherever humans go, death follows.
The only way to stop them is to kill them first.
Tie her up.
No.
When the moon rises, we'll feast on a princess.
What are you doing?
She'll pay for the life that we lost.
Mother, you're not making any sense.
You already made your choice, Red.
You're one of us now. Act like it.
Kill her.
No.
I won't kill my friend.
Then I will.
No. Mother, stop!
Sorry, my daughter.
This is what it means to be a wolf.
Please.
Red!
I didn't mean to.
I'm--I'm sorry, mother.
You chose her.
No.
I chose me.
I'm not a killer.
She's close.
There you are.
The next one goes between your eyes!
Ruby!
Why are you protecting her?
We're not sheep, David!
We don't need to be led by a shepherd!
Listen to me! Ruby didn't kill Billy.
He did.
He stole her cloak
and killed Billy in cold blood to make it look like a wolf,
all to get you to think I wasn't leading this town as I should.
Hold up!
Somebody already died because of what this man did.
Let's not spill more blood. She won't hurt anyone.
She's just scared.
Ruby?
I know you're in there, so listen to me.
It was Spencer, not you.
Don't let him trick you into thinking you're a monster.
All right.
All right. Poor...
Poor choice of words.
Please.
Ruby.
I know you.
I know the real you,
and I know you can control the wolf.
Ruby.
Ruby?
Ruby.
It's me.
David.
You saved me.
No. You saved yourself.
I just reminded you of what you already knew.
What happened?
Where's Spencer?
He's gone.
Go. Go.
Okay.
You think you can hide from a wolf?
I wasn't trying to hide.
You killed an innocent man.
He was a mouse.
He was better than you'll ever be.
You want to make a deal? It's not gonna happen.
I'm not interested in making a deal.
I just want to see the look on your face when you realize something.
What's that?
That you're never gonna see your wife or your daughter again.
What are you talking about?
You really should be more cautious
with something so valuable.
No! No.
It doesn't matter how much fairy dust you gather...
No!
or how much you rally the town behind you.
Your family's gone.
David, don't.
I told you,
you should've killed me when you had the chance.
May you always run free beneath the moon's pale light.
Good-bye, mother.
I'm so sorry.
I know what it's like to lose your family.
I didn't lose my family today.
I protected it.
Thank you.
My mother wanted me to choose between being a wolf and being a human.
Granny did, too.
You are the only person who ever thought it was okay for me to be both.
'Cause that's who you are.
Come on.
Let's go find the cabin.
He may never see his mother or grandmother again.
How am I gonna break that news to him?
You won't have to.
Travel between worlds is as hard as it comes.
Fairy dust on its own isn't enough.
It took an entire curse to get us here in the first place.
Without the hat--
You'll find another way.
You don't know that.
But I know you,
and I know you'll never give up until you do.
And, David,
you're not gonna be doing this alone.
Thank you.
Do you mind giving granny a call?
Sure. Why? What for?
I may have left Belle chained up in the library.
Somebody should probably--
Unchain her?
Yeah.
Yeah. I'll take care of it.
Where you going?
I've still got a few hours of wolfstime left.
You helped me regain control.
I want to do something I haven't done in a very long time.
What's that?
Run.
What are you doing?
Uh, just thinking.
Come on. Mulan has some ideas where Cora might be hiding.
Wait.
Don't be scared.
Snow! Snow!
Hey. I'm here. It's okay.
It's okay. It's just another nightmare.
No, this time, it was different. There was a little boy. He...
He put out the fire. He talked to me.
A little boy?
What'd he say?
He said...
