Hanna is not picking up, and she's not with Mona.
Or Caleb, but she did drop by his place
last night to tell him that she would be going
off the grid for a couple of days.
She's gonna do something to Noel.
布置
Maybe we could just skip the headache
and inevitable parental drama and just elope.
We could be wine tasting under the Tuscan sun by Friday.
Jordan and I broke up.
Are we still friends?
Always.
It's happening again.
Noel Kahn.
He's the one doing this to us.
Can you come over?
I'll be right there.
I'm Agent Lee from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
You were involved with Nicole Gordon?
Yes, I was.
We have reason to believe that she may be alive.
Did Ezra get to Colombia okay?
Yeah.
妮可不是人质之一 我明天回家
Any news about Nicole?
Spencer. What happened?
Are you okay?
Someone's in the house.
That's Noel's parents' cabin.
Oh, my God.
That's the same area where Hanna was held captive.
But I thought his parents sold this place years ago.
God only knows what's inside.
Hopefully, the evidence we need to finally end this thing.
Noel Kahn was there the whole time?
We may not be able to prove that he tortured Hanna
but this proves that he tortured us.
I knew you'd eventually slip up.
The cellphone was a big screw-up.
Be careful, Hanna, or you'll end up just like Sara.
If we do this, there's no stepping back from it.
And we risk the police finding out about Archer.
You mean, finding out that Hanna ran him over
and you buried him like a dog?
To quote my dead husband, "Karma's a bitch."
It was an accident.
And we knew how it looked.
We did it to protect Hanna.
Who's currently our resident girl gone rogue.
I'm trying her one last time.
Let's just ping her cell and go get her.
I gave her a new phone, okay? You can't hack it.
Why isn't she picking up?
Because Noel probably has her locked up
in another slaughtering hole.
Hey, it's Hanna.
Leave a message.
Let's just call the cops, okay.
Tell them everything you just
told us about Jenna and Noel.
And Sara Harvey.
None of us believes that was an accident.
I'm heading to The Radley. Maybe Jenna will lead us to Noel.
Do we call Furey or 911?
Noel is out there somewhere, and he might have Hanna.
911. What is your emergency?
I think my friend's been abducted.
Wake up, bitch.
Noel, please!
Please open the door! You can't leave me in here!
I'm begging you! Please!
This is your chance to tell me the truth.
Just admit it.
Admit you're A.D.
Fine.
We'll do it my way.
第七季 第十集
I want an update as soon as they get to Kahn's lakehouse.
And I want Mary Drake found and brought in for questioning.
His stepsister hasn't left the Radley since yesterday morning.
We verified her story with hotel security.
Keep a tail on her.
Not sure how much of a threat a blind girl can be.
You haven't met Jenna.
Look, I was hoping to buy you a beer after your shift
but doesn't look like that's gonna happen.
Well, today doesn't have to be my last day.
I-I can...
Toby.
I know that you and Spencer are old friends
but I promise you
nothing's gonna happen to those women on my watch.
Excuse me, Detective Furey?
If I don't see you later...
thank you for your service.
You guys, it was Mona. The cops questioned Jenna.
Well, did they arrest her?
No, she's still at The Radley.
You say that like it's a good thing.
Well, yeah, I mean, she can't lead us to Noel if she's locked up.
I'm gonna go meet up with Mona.
Call us if you hear anything.
I'm sorry that I lied to you last night.
I should have told you about Noel. I was just scared.
You don't have to apologize, Spencer.
I did my homework on you right after we met.
I read about Charlotte and the bunker.
And now to find out that Noel was helping her
keep you down there?
I got an APB out on Kahn, and I'm bringing him in
and we're gonna find Hanna...today.
Thank you.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Did I just do that?
Yeah, well, it's okay.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Just don't let it happen again.
At least not here.
The police are looking for Hanna Marin.
Any information regarding her whereabouts
should be directed to the Rosewood Police Department.
Hanna Marin, blonde, blue-eyed, and 23 years old has not...
I'm gonna go call Hanna's mom. She's at a conference in London.
I just, I don't know where she's staying.
Friends and family first contacted the police
after Marin stopped answering her cell phone
and failed to return to her home.
So what's the rush, if you don't mind me asking?
Trying to prove somebody's your baby daddy?
Something like that.
I can get you the results by tomorrow.
I am telling you, Noel, the cops are all over me.
They think you have Hanna. Do you?
Just call me, okay?
Jenna's left three messages for Noel since I've been here.
She doesn't know where he is.
So did Noel double-cross her..
or did Hanna get to him first?
Oh, yeah. That's right...
They sent out a final search crew
but I think that's mainly to appease the people
that came down here hoping, like me.
Ezra, I'm sorry.
I get why you deleted the call.
No one should have to mourn someone twice.
So I'll pick you up from the airport.
We can go to that diner that you like
the place with the sugar-cream pie.
That's okay. I can take a cab.
But if you don't have any plans, I would really like it
if you're home when I got there.
I'll see you tonight then.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hanna Marin, white female, blonde
mid twenties, is now considered a missing person
possibly abducted by one Noel Kahn
white male, also mid twenties.
He should be considered dangerous and possibly armed.
I need your help, and I need you to come alone.
I'm sorry to rope you in like this
but when I saw the news, I didn't know who else to call.
Well, next time, call me before you abduct someone
and go on the run. It just makes my life a little easier.
When do you get the test results?
Not till tomorrow.
What are you doing?
Looking for this.
What is that?
You seriously haven't spoken to anyone?
Well, I've kinda had my hands full.
There is footage on here that proves
that Noel was working with Charlotte.
He was part of the dollhouse.
What?
I was worried he destroyed it, but clearly you knocked him out
before he had the chance to.
Look, Hanna, you don't need the test results.
This is more than enough to put Noel behind bars.
No.
What do you mean no?
Busting Noel for the dollhouse
is like busting a mob boss for tax evasion.
It's settling..
and I'm not ready to settle.
But, Hanna, you can't get any worse than the dollhouse.
I have scars on my back that say different.
I want Noel to be held accountable
for everything he did.
I'm gonna prove he's A.D.
I need to.
Blonde female, early twenties,
blue eyes, 5'7.."
Please.
Help me. I just need to stay hidden for ten more hours.
That's the last thing you're gonna do.
Thanks, Paige.
Stay as long as you'd like.
Here.
Thanks.
I also have some breakfast stuff
in here if you're hungry.
I couldn't be more nauseated.
How much longer are we gonna be penned up in here like veal?
Furey says we can't leave until they find Noel.
Well, it's hard enough going through this
without being gawked at.
You mean, Paige? I invited her.
Why? She has nothing to do with this.
She's here to support us.
Don't forget, she was targeted by "A" when--
Fine, I just think it's a little pathetic
that she's using us to get close to you.
Doesn't she know that you're dating someone?
Yeah, well
things with Sabrina are kind of on pause.
I can't talk to her about this.
Em, it's all over the news.
And I know I'll have to deal with it, okay.
But it's easier with Paige. She's been through this before.
She understands it and me.
Guys, looks like something's happening.
Maybe they found Hanna.
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
Thank you for the update, Greg.
Let's go ahead and alert the state troopers too.
What's going on?
The officers who went to the Kahn lakehouse
found two sets of footprints.
There was a struggle.
It looks bad, I know
but I wanted to prove to my friends and to all of you
that Noel is the person who's been tormenting us..
...so I went to Holly Brook to find the girl
he pushed down the stairs.
If I could get her to talk
we'd have a credible witness.
Unfortunately, I couldn't track her down.
I'm just so sorry that I worried everybody
by disappearing like that.
I wasn't thinking.
You've gotten really good at this.
Do you think the cops will buy it?
Definitely. It's your friends you need to worry about.
They're way harder to fool.
God, I hate lying to them.
You're doing them a favor by not getting them involved.
Thank you again, Mona.
Are you sure you're able to handle--
Don't worry. I got my end covered.
So why don't you run it through for me one more time?
It looks bad..
...I know, I'm just so sorry I worried everybody
by disappearing like that.
I wasn't thinking.
Well, since we opened up an investigation
I'm gonna have to have you sign a written statement.
Sure.
Hanna, you should have called us.
I know.
I'm sorry again.
Guys, what's going on?
Hey, Caleb.
All units, please be advised
Hanna Marin has been found alive.
Still rocking that jungle red?
I'm not fickle. When I find what works for me, I stick with it.
Well, the trick is knowing
when something isn't working for you anymore.
Enough with the makeup tips.
What do you want?
I'm here to make an offer
a one-time-only get-out-of-jail-free card.
Stop looking for Noel, leave those girls alone
and get the first Greyhound out of town.
And why would I do that?
Because, Bonnie,
Clyde's gonna be in police custody real soon
and my hunch is, he's gonna sing like a canary.
It sounds like I'd be better off sticking around.
Not if you want us to say you had nothing to do with it.
Mom, I'm telling you, it was all a misunderstanding.
Thanks, officer.
No, don't go on the plane.
Go to your conference.
Alright. I love you.
Did she calm down?
Yeah, she's gonna stay there.
Thanks for bringing me home.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
I told you guys what happened.
I know. I know.
So then why do you keep asking me if I'm okay?
I guess I'm waiting for an answer that I believe.
I'm okay.
Sorry, I don't buy that.
Seriously. Caleb, you can go, alright.
There's a cop right outside my door, and he's not moving.
Well, neither am I.
Seriously.
What are you talking about?
Hanna, the last time I left you in a room alone
A.D. took you.
So I hate to break it to you, girl
but you're stuck with me.
Well, I really want to be left alone.
Why? Do you have somewhere you need to be?
You know, you are a real pain in the ass.
So are you.
Excuse me?
Hanna, you don't do dishes until they mold.
You eat French fries in bed, cold.
You don't gas up the car until it starts beeping.
You won't admit that we're meant to spend
the rest of our lives together.
You send food back if the waiter breathes on it funny.
And you know what, there's probably milk in that fridge
that's older than me.
What did you say?
About the milk?
No.
I never want to spend another day without you..
...ever, for the rest of my life.
Like I said, you're a real pain in the ass.
Thanks again for letting me crash here.
Seeing Hanna and Caleb together,
I thought it'd be a good idea
to just give them some alone time.
I-I can't shake the feeling
that Hanna's not telling us the truth.
I mean, do you really think that she would go off the grid
just so we wouldn't know?
I'm pregnant.
What?
I'm pregnant.
I just..
In there.
Are you sure?
There's two lines on the stick.
I was waiting for one to disappear, but it didn't.
At first, I thought I was just stressed..
...I mean, like before, but it was a false alarm.
Is it... Archer's?
Of course. Who else would it be?
Oh, my God. I can't believe this is happening.
I thought we were careful.
Look, it's gonna be okay.
It's not how I pictured starting a family.
You don't have to make any decisions right now.
I know.
I just..
I thought my mom would be here when this happened..
...to give me advice.
Not that she was very good at it.
At least I wouldn't be alone.
No. You're not alone.
I'm here, okay, whatever you decide to do.
Hey, you're still in the air right now
but I just wanted to let you know
that when you get home, there's..
...there's gonna be a cop outside your door
and I, I didn't want you to freak out.
I'll explain everything when you get here.
I can't wait to see you.
I just checked in with Dispatch.
Wherever Noel is, he's not gonna be stupid enough
to try anything tonight.
I personally placed an officer
on every one of your doorsteps.
Thank you.
I'm taking the night shift.
Eating dinner alone in the squad car's kinda depressing
so I got extra hoping you might join me.
Dinner?
Yeah.
Here?
Well, we could both eat in the squad car.
I can't turn down Sarno's. What did you get?
Two orders of spaghetti Bolognese.
That's actually my favorite.
And I also got you a cherry soda
with crushed not cubed ice.
How did you know that?
One of your friends might have helped me out.
Was it Toby?
I don't snitch on my informants.
Hey, hang on, hang on. I'm coming along too.
No, please.
You can't get off now.
It's gonna be okay.
Ali..
...you're really vulnerable right now.
That's not why.
I promise.
His plane landed hours ago.
I'm just asking you to tell me if he got on the--
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Like I said, it's against our--
Don't you understand? He's not answering his phone.
He could be lying in a ditch somewhere.
I understand that, ma'am.
but I'm not authorized to give out that information--
I'm his fiance!
...to a spouse or a family member.
I can transfer to our manager, Lisa Ridenour
but she's very tough, and I'm sure..
Miracle that friends and family prayed for.
Nicole Gordon, one of the 15 American aid workers
that went missing from the southwestern region
of Colombia three years ago, has been found alive.
Today, through tears of joy
Nicole reunited with loved ones
after a rescue mission led by
two US agencies was successful.
...prayed for.
Nicole Gordon, one of the 15 American aid workers
that went missing from the southwestern region
of Colombia three years ago, has been found alive.
So you thought that you could leave without saying goodbye?
You know I hate goodbyes.
I do.
Is Yvonne in the house?
No, she, um
she went to go pick up some more boxes
but I thought you were supposed to be on lockdown.
I'm with a cop.
Former cop.
Well, Furey said he would make an exception.
I bet it's just for you, though.
So this is it?
For now, yeah
this is, uh, this is it.
This is the one from your nightstand.
I wanted you to have it.
I'm really, really happy for you, Toby.
You deserve love.
You deserve that kind of great, big, beautiful love..
more than anyone else I know.
Thank you.
I hope that you find the same.
Me too.
Toby.
Can I kiss you?
Just one last time?
Just to say goodbye?
Can I help you?
I'm here to see Emily Fields.
Yeah. What is this regarding?
I need to talk to my friend.
You'll have to call her on the phone.
She's not answering her phone.
I was here yesterday. My name's Paige.
Ask Detective Furey. He'll tell you.
Detective Furey's unavailable
and I'm afraid I can't let you in.
I only will stay for a second.
Can I at least buzz the intercom?
No, I'm sorry, ma'am.
Please, I just have to drop
something off for my girlfriend.
I'll be a sec.
Paige.
Hi. He's giving me such a hard time about seeing you.
Why are you here so early? Is everything okay?
Yeah, today is just the deadline
for our job paperwork to be turned in.
Didn't want you to miss it.
Thanks.
Did you sleep well last night?
Yeah, uh..
Ali's kind of having a rough time.
I think you're all kind of going through a rough time.
Are you allowed to go out and get some breakfast?
I actually should get back.
I, I'd let you in, but it's not a good time.
Unbelievable.
Paige, come on.
Nothing has changed, has it, Em?
Look, I can't talk about it right now
but Ali's going through something
and she needs me right now.
Yeah? What about what you need?
No, she's, she-she's in trouble.
No, she isn't.
She saw us getting close again
and now she's trying to drive a wedge in between us.
Ali is the same person that she always used to be.
She doesn't want anyone happy unless it's on her terms.
Paige, don't walk away.
I have to because you're still
controlled by her. It's like you're her puppet.
No, that's not what's happening.
If you just gave me a chance to explain--
You know what, call me when you finally decide
to cut the strings.
Do you have the results?
Yeah, they're not a match.
What? Are you sure?
We tested the sample you gave
against the DNA you provided, and they don't match.
Is there anyway that you made a mistake?
No, those two people are not related.
Okay, so there's no way that you dropped ketchup from your hotdog
or one of the hairs from your beard fell in there?
Uh, I don't have a beard.
Look, you have to be wrong.
We didn't make a mistake.
They're not a match. I'm sorry.
So you just decided to go rogue?
Well, I was sure Noel was our guy
and you guys were just getting cold feet.
Hanna, if by cold feet you mean
we weren't willing to abduct someone
and beat a confession out of them
then, yes, we got cold feet.
I'm sorry.
I thought if I did this on my own
I could prove to you guys that Noel was A.D.
I cannot but notice you keep talking in the past tense.
Well, there is a problem.
What problem?
I was wrong.
I got the test results back
and Noel isn't Mary's second child.
He isn't?
No.
So you're saying he's not A.D.?
Well, I'm not really saying that either.
What are you saying, Hanna?
I'm saying I have Noel tied up
to a chair in an old motel room
and we need to deal with that.
So we're we again?
Guys, forget about the blood test.
Noel pushed a girl down a flight of stairs
and tormented us in the dollhouse.
Emily's right, just because he's not Mary's kid
doesn't mean he's not A.D.
How do we know for sure?
Well, why don't we ask Noel?
Together?
It's worth a try.
Okay, and how are we supposed to get past the cops?
We can't exactly take them with us
and they're not about to let us go on a field trip.
Well, they check the perimeter every 15 minutes
so we just have to wait until it gets dark and then sneak out.
You don't think they're gonna notice
that it's dead quiet in here?
You guys, we all need to calm down and stop freaking out.
My brain hurts. I need food.
There's Ramen noodles in the cupboard. Go nuts.
How can you even think about food right now?
Noel is out there somewhere.
And I personally won't be able to breathe
until he's found.
You did remember to, like, water and feed him, right?
Of course.
Did you remember to tie him up?
Oh, my God.
Oh, this is bad, really bad.
This is really not very good.
He took the camera.
He can make it look like I kidnapped him.
You did kidnap him, Hanna.
Well, now he can prove it.
"1465 Elm Street. 10:00 P.M., bitches."
"Let's swap.
My thumb drive for your camera."
Thank you!
She's got two drinks. Who is she meeting?
Looks like we're about to find out.
Sydney?
Compliments of Jenna Marshall.
Cheers.
Still hard to say goodbye?
It's just a house.
You don't mean that.
Yeah, I do.
It's a house you built almost entirely by yourself.
I just wish I knew who bought it.
I guess we'll find out when they move in.
Someone will send you a note, Emily maybe or Spencer.
You're about ready to head out?
I made some sandwiches for the drive.
I'll grab a cooler.
Okay.
马上出发 我只是想说
Is the door locked?
I doubt it.
Who would wanna break in here?
Oh, my God, I hate rats.
I hate not knowing what this place is.
And why Noel wants us here.
Hey, you guys, there's something over here.
None of this feels right.
"Joseph Lloyd King.
"School for the Blind.
Established in 1873."
I visited Jenna in a blind school in Philadelphia
but not this place.
The school operated here until 2009
and then it was relocated to Bridge County.
So Jenna could have come here
when she first lost her eyesight.
I didn't lose my sight.
You took it from me!
How did she get here?
I thought Caleb and Mona
were tailing her.
I have the thumb drive.
Give us the camera and we walk away.
And we'll pretend like none of this happened.
Leave it on the table.
...chance to tell me the truth? Wake up, bitch.
What is that?
It's me
trying to get answers from Noel.
The camera's upstairs. Let's go.
Fine. We'll do it my way.
This is your chance to tell me the truth. Fine.'
We'll do it my way.
Just admit it.
Admit you're A.D.
Was there a blind baby epidemic I didn't know about?
This is where they learned how to take care of kids.
I need to. No.
Just admit it.
Admit you're..
Let's get out of here.
What is this place?
I'm not really sure.
I feel like I just walked into Tim Burton's garage sale.
Well, I'm not buying anything.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, no. I left my phone upstairs.
Seriously?
I don't wanna go back up there by myself.
Come on.
Just hurry up, okay?
This place is a creep-fest.
Did you hear that?
You really think we'd let you leave?
You know too much.
You can run..
...but you can't hide.
What is taking them so long?
Oh, God, I really wanna get out here.
They brought us here to kill us.
Grudge much, Jenna?
I'm calling the police. Text Emily.
I don't have service.
Me neither.
Yeah, of course not!
There's gotta be another way up there. Come on.
I taught Jenna a lot..
...but one thing she taught Charlotte and me..
...that was how to smell fear.
Oh, my God!
Alison?
Is that you?
You've been the bitch
the missing girl, the dead girl.
Tonight, you get to be me.
Now you see what I see.
You bitches never understood me.
I always get what I want.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
What is going on?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it's a head.
Oh, my God.
It's a real head.
You're like scared little rats!
And you should be.
We gotta get out of here. Jenna's got a gun.
No!
Oh, God!
They locked us in! They were never gonna let us out of here.
Where's Spencer?
Is that you, Spencer?
Hiding in the corner?
I smell your blood.
This is as much for me as it is for Charlotte.
Spencer!
Spencer!
Spencer!
Spence..
In here!
Mary!
Spencer.
Oh, my God!
Spence, wake up! What did you do?
What?
Please don't leave me.
Spencer.
I would never hurt you.
I'm your mother.
Who are you?
Did you shoot Spencer?
You're A.D.
