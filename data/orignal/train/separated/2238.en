Sir, there's news from the battlefield.
Avonlea has fallen.
My gods.
If only he had come.
Well, he didn't, did he?
Ogres are not men.
We have to do something. We have to stop them.
They are unstoppable.
He could be on his way right now, papa.
It's too late, my girl.
It's just...too late.
It's him. It has to be him.
How could he get past the walls?
Open it.
Well, that was a bit of a letdown.
You sent me a message--
Something about, um,
"Help. Help. We're dying. Can you save us?"
Now the answer is...
yes, I can.
Yes, I can protect your little town...
for a price.
We sent you a promise of gold.
Now you see, um,
I, uh...
make gold.
What I want is something a bit more special.
My price...
is her.
No.
The young lady is engaged to me.
I wasn't asking if she was engaged.
I'm not looking for love.
I'm looking for a caretaker
for my rather large estate.
It's her or no deal.
Get out.
Leave!
As you wish.
No. Wait.
I will go with him.
I forbid it.
No.
No one decides my fate but me.
I shall go.
It's forever, dearie.
My family,
my friends--they will all live?
You have my word.
Then you have mine.
I will go with you forever.
Deal.
Belle. Belle.
You cannot do this.
Belle, please.
You can't go with this...
beast.
Father...
Gaston...
it's been decided.
You know...
she's right.
The deal is struck.
Oh. Congratulations on your little war.
Well, this is just perfect.
I've been looking for you, Mr French.
I'll have your money next week.
The terms of the loan were fairly specific.
Take the van.
Wait. No.
Tomorrow's Valentine's day.
It's the biggest day of--
I've got a grand in roses in the back.
Stop! You've gotta let me sell 'em.
I'm gonna leave you two to onontinue this conversation.
Oh, this is no way to do business, Gold.
You are the lowest!
People aren't gonna put up with this!
Mr. Gold, that was quite a show back there.
Well, Mr French is just having a bad day.
Happens to the best of us.
I've been meaning to talk to you about something.
Ahah, and the moment you have something I want to discuss,
we'll have that little chat.
No, we're gonna do this now. It'll only take a moment.
Is there something eating you, dear?
Something you need to get out in the open?
'Cause it's gonna have to wait.
Please.
Oh, you got the book.
Yeah. Yeah, I just started it.
It's great. Can't wait to see how it ends.
Uh, I can push the tables together if you guys...
Oh, no, we're not together.
No, it's--
Hey, David.
Hey.
Mary Margaret.
How's your day going?
Henry's fine.
That's not what I asked you.
You sure?
Really. He's his normal self.
Regina won't keep you separated forever.
When people are supposed to be together,
they find a way.
Yeah.
So he's his normal self. He's fine.
He's happy?
Yes.
No.
He misses you a lot.
Trust me. I'm with him, like, six hours a day.
Six hours?
You take newborns?
'Cause I'd love six hours off.
Ashley.
I didn't--I didn't even recognize you.
Oh. Baby on the outside?
How's it going?
It's, uh...
It's, uh...
I mean, the baby's great, but, uh,
we really haven't had time to do the whole getting married thing.
So that's been rough,
and Sean's been working double shifts at the cannery.
Well, he has to work.
On valentine's day? Yeah.
He couldn't get out of it.
I'm sorry. That sucks.
It doesn't have to.
Come out with me. Let's have a girls' night.
We can all go. Mary Margaret, Emma, too,
if you leave the badge at home.
I'm not really in the party mood,
but you guys can all go and have fun.
What's that?
It's the station.
Something's up.
Sheriff Swan.
Your neiborr saw your front door open.
They called it in.
It appears I've been robbed.
Funny how that keeps happening to you.
Yeah, well...
I'm a difficult man to love.
Uh, where-- where are you taking me?
Let's call it... your room.
My room?
Well, it sounds a lot nicer than "Dungeon."
No!
Hey! You can't just leave me in here!
Hello? Hello?
You will serve me my meals,
and you will clean the dark castle.
I-I understand.
You will dust my collection and launder my clothing.
Yes.
You will fetch me fresh straw when I'm spinning at the wheel.
Got it.
Oh. And you will skin the children I hunt for their pelts.
That one was a quip. Not serious.
Right.
My. I'm so sorry, but, uh...
It's... It's chipped.
You--you can hardly see it.
Oh, it's just a cup.
Sheriff Swan, you can go now.
I know exactly what was taken and who did it.
I've got it from here.
No, you don't.
This was a robbery. Public menace.
And if you don't tell me what you know,
I'll have to arrest you for obstruction of justice.
I have a feeling you don't want to be behind bars.
Indeed not.
All right, his name's Moe French.
He sells flowers. He recently defaulted on a loan.
A short time ago,
we had a little disagreement over collateral.
Okay. I'll go get him, check him out.
I'm sure you will, assuming I don't find him...
Let's just say bad things tend to happen to bad people.
Is that a threat?
Observation.
Good luck.
Why do you spin so much?
Sorry. It's just...
You've spun straw into more gold than you could ever spend.
I like to watch the wheel.
Helps me forget.
Forget what?
I guess it worked.
What are you doing?
Opening these. It's almost spring.
We should let some light in.
What did you do? Nail them down?
Yes.
Um... Thank you.
Thank you.
It's no matter.
I'll, uh, put the curtains back up.
There's no need. I'll get used to it.
You're welcome. You're right.
Your man Moe ripped you off.
It was all still at his place.
And the man himself?
Closing in on him.
So job well half-done then.
In less than a day, I got everything back.
Is something wrong?
You've recovered nothing.
There's something missing.
I'll get it when I find him.
Not if I find him first.
Why did you want me here?
The place was filthy.
I think you were lonely.
I mean, any man would be lonely.
I'm not a man.
So I've had a couple of months to look around, you know.
And, uh, upstairs,
there's, uh, clothing, small,
as if for a-a child?
Was it yours or...
Or was there a son?
There was.
There was a son.
I lost him...
As I did his mother.
I'm... I'm sorry.
So you--you were a man once.
An ordinary man.
If I'm never going to know another person in my whole life,
can't I at least know you?
Perhaps...
perhaps you just want to learn the monster's weaknesses.
You're not a monster.
You think you're uglier than you are.
That's why you cover all the mirrors up, isn't it?
I am sir Gaston,
and you, beast, have taken--
Who was that?
Just an old woman selling flowers.
Here.
If you'll have it.
Why, thank you.
You had a life, Belle,
before... this--
Friends... family.
What made you choose to come here with me?
Heroism.
Sacrifice.
You know, there aren't a lot of opportunities
for women in this land to-- to show what they can do,
to see the world, to be heroes.
So when you arrived,
that was my chance.
I always wanted to be brave.
I figured, do the brave thing and...
bravery would follow.
And is it everything you hoped?
I did want to see the world.
That part didn't really work out.
But, uh...
I did save my village.
And what about your, uh...
betrothed?
It was an arranged marriage.
Honestly, I never really cared much for Gaston.
You know, to me, love is...
love is layered.
Love is a...
a mystery to be uncovered.
Yeah, I could never truly give my heart
to someone as superficial as he.
But, um, you were going to tell me about your son.
I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.
Go to town...
and fetch me some straw.
When you return,
I'll share my tale.
But...
You... Town?
You-- you trust me to come back?
Oh, no.
I expect I'll never see you again.
Pace yourself, Ashley.
I am.
This is the first night out since I've had the baby.
I am making up for lost time.
Ash, check out those guys.
Honey, I'm still with Sean.
You're not married, and he's not here.
He's working.
He's always working.
Have fun moping.
She's right.
He is always working.
I thought love would be different.
Me, too.
Two Valentines.
Sounds like a complicated life.
Oh, no, I- I just couldn't decide.
These are both for the same woman?
Well, they're both so... us.
I see.
Well, you're fortunate you have someone that loves you.
I really am.
Love.
It's like a delicate flame.
And once it's gone,
it's gone forever.
Best of luck to you.
Thanks.
Oh, bless you.
Ah. Thank you.
Walk.
Now you see, here's the thing--
I don't normally let people get away.
Did my carriage splash you?
Oh. Oh, no, I'm-- I'm fine.
You know, I'm tired of riding.
Let me stretch my legs and walk with you for a spell.
You carry very little.
I don't want to be slowed down.
You're running from someone.
The question is, master or lover?
Master and lover.
I might take a rest.
You-- you go on ahead.
So if I'm right,
you love your employer,
but you're leaving him.
I might love him.
I mean, I could, except...
something evil has taken root in him.
Sounds like a curse to me.
And all curses can be broken.
A kiss born of true love would do it.
Oh, child, no.
I would never suggest a young woman
to kiss a man who held her captive.
What kind of message is that?
Right.
Besides, if he loves you, he would've let you go.
And if he doesn't love you,
well, then the kiss won't even work.
Well, he did let me go.
Yes, but no kiss happened.
And a kiss-- a kiss is enough?
He'd be a man again?
An ordinary man.
True love's kiss
will break any curse.
Oh, you're back already.
Good.
Good thing.
I'm, uh, I'm nearly out of straw.
Come on. You're happy that I'm back.
I'm not unhappy.
And, uh,
you promised me a story.
Did I?
Tell me about your son.
I lost him.
There's nothing more to tell, really.
And since then,
you've loved no one,
and no one has loved you.
Why did you come back?
I wasn't going to.
But then...
something changed my mind.
What's happening?
Kiss me again. It's working.
What is?
Any curse can be broken.
Who told you that?!
Who knows that?!
I-I-I don't know. She, uh...
She--she--
"She."
You... evil... soul.
This was you!
You turned her against me!
You think you can make me weak?
You think you can defeat me?!
Who are you talking to?
The queen!
Your friend, the queen.
How did she get to you?
The--the queen? I don't--
I knew this was a trick.
I knew you could never care for me.
Oh, yeah.
You're working for her.
Or is this all you?
Is this you being the hero and killing the beast?
It was working--
Shut up!
This means it's true love!
Shut the hell up!
Why won't you believe me?!
Because no one--
No one could ever, ever love me!
Let me explain. Okay?
Let me explain.
Well, that is... fascinating.
Truly fascinating.
I'm gonna let you breathe in a second,
and you're gonna say two sentences.
The first is gonna tell me where it is.
The second is gonna tell me who told you to take it.
Do you understand the rules?
yeah.
Good. Let's begin.
I needed that van.
Now you see, that is not a good first sentence.
Oh! Gold!
Listen.
Tell me where it is!
Stop.
Tell me where it is!
Oh, stop!
It wasn't my fault.
"My fault"?
What are you talking about, "My fault"?
You shut her out.
You had her love and you shut her out!
She's gone.
She's gone forever.
She's not coming back.
And it's your fault!
Not mine!
You are her father!
yours! It's yours!
it's your fault! It's your fault!
Stop.
Girls' night's really working out for you.
I thought it would make me feel better.
But the truth is...
I need a "Be with my guy" Night.
But he's never around.
And I'm at home with the baby all day.
I mean, what's the point of being together
if we're not together?
I get it.
Loving someone you can't be with...
It's a terrible, terrible burden.
Look, this was a bad idea.
I should--I should go home.
Ashley.
Sean?
Hey.
I thought that you were working tonight.
I am. It's my break,
And I had to see you...
And ask you something.
Will you marry me?
I only have a 20-minute break, so, um,
anytime now.
yes!
My truck's outside if you want to take a ride
Before I head back to work.
It's not much of a date.
It's the best date.
Then your carriage awaits.
Get in.
How's girls' night?
David?
What are you doing here?
I knew you'd be here,
And I, uh,
I wanted to give you your Valentine's Day card.
Check up on me?
Maybe a little.
I didn't want you finding somebody else.
Like you?
"Kathryn, I woof you."
No. I'm so sorry.
I meant...
I meant this one.
I-I-I always thought
that if two people were supposed to be together,
they'd find a way.
But, David, if this is our way,
I think we should find another one.
Mary Margaret...
I think you should go home to Kathryn.
I know.
You're right.
But it doesn't mean I'm gonna give up.
We'll find that way.
I hope so.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Happy Valentine's Day.
So I heard you managed not to break anything he needs.
You're lucky, Mr. Gold.
You got a funny definition of "lucky."
You have a funny definition of "justice."
What did he really do?
He stole.
That reaction was about more than taking a few trinkets.
You said something about how he hurt "her,"
what happened to "her"? Who was that?
What did he do?
If someone needs help, maybe I can help.
No. I'm sorry, Sheriff. I think you heard that wrong.
You really don't want to cooperate.
Look, we're done here.
Actually...
we're not.
You're under arrest.
So...
what are you going to do to me?
Go.
Go?
I don't want you anymore, dearie.
You know, you were freeing yourself.
You could've had happiness
if you just believed that someone could want you.
But you couldn't take the chance.
That's a lie.
You're a coward, Rumplestiltskin.
And no matter how thick you make your skin,
that doesn't change.
I'm not a coward, dearie.
It's quite simple, really.
My power...
means more to me than you.
No.
No, it doesn't.
You just don't think I can love you.
Now you've made your choice.
And you're going to regret it.
Forever.
And all you'll have...
is an empty heart...
and a chipped cup.
Pastrami.
You want half?
You know I still owe you that favor.
Nice, fatty pastrami.
Delicious way to clear the books.
Well, I don't need a reminder that you owe me a favor.
And when the day comes that I make my request,
it'll be for more than half a sandwich.
Sheriff Swan?
I'm letting you have 30 minutes with Henry.
Take him out. Buy him ice cream.
You want me to leave you alone with a prisoner?
29.1/2 minutes.
Hi, Emma.
Hey.
Bring me back a cone.
Just this once.
Come on. Let's go.
You really wanted that little chat, didn't you?
Apparently, this is the only way I could do it.
Please.
Sit.
Now when two people both want something the other has,
a deal can always be struck.
Do you have what I want?
Yes.
So...
you did put him up to it, then.
I merely suggested that...
strong men take what they need.
Oh, yeah, and you told him
just exactly what to take, didn't you?
We used to know each other so well, Mr. Gold.
Has it really come down to this?
It seems it has, yeah.
But you know what I want.
What is it you want?
I want you to answer one question.
And answer it simply.
What's your name?
It's Mr. Gold.
Your real name.
Every moment I've spent on this earth, that's been my name.
But what about moments spent elsewhere?
What are you asking me?
I think you know.
If you want me to return what's yours,
tell me your name.
Rumplestiltskin.
Now give me what I want.
Such hostility.
Oh, yeah.
Over this?
Such a... sentimental little keepsake.
Thank you...
Your majesty.
So...
now that we're being honest with each other,
let's remember how things used to be, shall we?
And don't let these bars fool you, dear.
I'm the one with the power around here.
I'm gonna be out of here in no time,
and nothing between us will change.
We shall see.
Flimsy locks.
I have a deal to discuss.
A certain... mermaid.
I'm not dealing today.
Are you angry with me?
What is it this time?
Your little deception failed.
You'll never be more powerful than me.
You can keep trying, dearie,
but you're never gonna beat me.
Is this about that girl I met on the road?
What was her name?
Margie?
Verna?
Belle.
Right.
Well, you can rest assured I had nothing to do with that tragedy.
What tragedy?
You don't know?
After she got home...
her fiance had gone missing.
And after her stay here,
her...
"association" with you,
no one would want her, of course.
Her father shunned her,
cut her off, shut her out.
So she needs...
a home?
He was cruel to her.
He locked her in a tower
and sent in clerics to cleanse her soul
with scourges and flaying.
After a while, she threw herself off the tower.
She died.
You're lying.
Am I?
We're done.
Fine.
I have other calls to make.
The place is looking dusty, rumple.
You should get a new girl.
Pretty.
Well, I know how hard you work.
Has anyone been to see her?
No, ma'am.
Not today.
Not ever.
