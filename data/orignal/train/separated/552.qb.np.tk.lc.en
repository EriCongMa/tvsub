come on guys , i got class in 15 minutes ,
this should not be that difficult .
we just need to figure out an idea for our final history project .
what we need to figure out is
greendale &apos;s obsession with group assignments .
classic herd mentality .
all right , britta doesn &apos;t have one . who else ?
i &apos;ve been told i look like a kennedy .
nope , not an idea . that &apos;s a statement .
anyone not on medication ?
jeff , we have to take this seriously .
this assignment ? this , we have to take seriously ?
&quot; pick any moment from history and tell me about it .
be as creative as you want . or not . i don &apos;t care .
professor cornwaaa ... &quot;
he didn &apos;t even finish signing his name .
okay , yes , he phoned this one in ,
but my run at valedictorian is in jeopardy .
as is mine .
as is shirley &apos;s ,
and i just took one for the team by accepting
that c @-@ plus on our last history paper .
as did i.
as did shirley .
so i &apos;d think you &apos;d want to rise to the occasion
and help get me back on top .
or me .
shirley , i &apos;m speaking for both you and me .
then , you might want to teach your mouth
how to say &quot; we , &quot; &quot; our , &quot; and &quot; us . &quot;
i &apos;ve been told i look like a kennedy .
nope , still just a random statement ,
and still useless .
okay . how about this ?
we do a series of banners ...
great , it &apos;s settled .
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m going to say !
don &apos;t need to . tomorrow is friday ,
and i have no intention of being here late .
your banner thing sounds doable ,
and this assignment ? passable , so passable .
and passable assures my graduation ,
so we are doing doable and passable .
uh , speaking of tomorrow , troy and britta ,
have you decided what you &apos;re gonna do
for your one @-@ year anniversary ?
of ?
your first date ?
da @-@ doy .
yeah ! that was a test ,
i was just kidding .
and you failed .
you guys are dating ? man !
somebody &apos;s sure working her way around the table .
aren &apos;t you ?
well , you should really do something special ,
something romantic .
like go back to senor kevin &apos;s for lunch ,
where it all began .
yeah , sure .
we could do that .
sure , that sounds fun .
speaking of anniversaries ,
it is the third anniversary of me and abed
watching freaky friday for the first time .
that , you remember ?
movie trolley is having
an &quot; end of the video store chain industry &quot; sale ,
so i got you a six @-@ pack of &quot; body switching &quot; movies
and a two @-@ year @-@ old box of raisinets ,
all for under five bucks .
all right , man . change up .
13 going on 30 , 17 again , 18 again ,
vice versa .
judge reinhold .
freaky friday .
oh , troy , you are so thoughtful .
i wish i had the capacity for sentimentality like you do .
me ? i wish i was more like you .
no emotional hang @-@ ups , endless cool adventures .
you have it so easy .
no , you do , troy .
no , you do , abed .
i wish i could switch places with you for just one day !
sorry . routine light switch check .
i thought that would work .
yeah , we &apos;re all floored it didn &apos;t .
第四季第十一集
good morning .
oh , and , um ...
happy one @-@ year anniversary .
yes . that would be this day .
look , i know that it was awkward yesterday .
they pointed it out and we didn &apos;t remember ,
but ... that doesn &apos;t mean that we should feel pressure
to make some big deal out of it , right ?
no , i &apos;m looking forward to it .
super looking forward to it . i &apos;m just saying ...
yeah .
same page .
excuse me .
hey , buddy , wake up !
remember yesterday , when we faked a body switching thing
and it didn &apos;t work ?
well , now , it &apos;s actually worked .
so , right now ...
i &apos;m you and you &apos;re me .
oh , my god .
this is wrinkling my brain ! and of all the days !
i got my big , important meeting with my study group .
me too .
oh , boy . here goes nothing .
okay , so we &apos;re telling the story
of the american revolution through banners .
everyone is responsible for one .
to maximize efficiency , i &apos;ve designated areas :
colored pencils and markers , paints , puffy paint ...
yes , there &apos;s a difference .
decoupage and glitter , a @-@ a @-@ and ...
this is the approval station ,
where shirley and i will decide
whether you have to start over or not .
annie , remember . we &apos;re doing doable and passable .
we &apos;re doing whatever it takes to help us ...
thank you .
beat leonard .
wait , leonard is now
the front runner for valedictorian ?
you &apos;re getting beat by leonard ?
he &apos;s so old .
all right .
yes , we slipped below leonard ,
but annie and i are a close three and two , respectively .
annie is the three .
that is what &quot; respectively &quot; suggests .
whoa ! that was weird .
we didn &apos;t mean to do that . we know exactly where we sit .
um , what &apos;s going on with you guys ?
oh , thank god , you noticed .
remember when we pretended to switch bodies yesterday ?
unfortunately , yes , dorks .
well , it really happened . i &apos;m actually abed .
and i &apos;m actually troy .
all right .
i don &apos;t care who &apos;s who .
we &apos;re all here , and that &apos;s all i need
to complete this passable project
in a doable amount of time .
wish we could help , jeff ,
but in order to switch back , we have to recreate
the exact moment that all this happened ,
but the dvd is missing .
of course it is .
so now , i have find it
while troy goes on an anniversary date with britta .
what ?
oh , hey . here &apos;s a fun sci @-@ fi thing .
how about you make a banner as troy
and you make a banner as abed ,
and we &apos;ll be done within the hour .
uh , per banner , if we &apos;re lucky .
and that &apos;s if we want an &quot; a. &quot;
okay , you two need to let go of the pressure
you &apos;re putting on this project to get an &quot; a. &quot;
i deserve to be number one !
sorry . or me !
sorry .
i have to go talk to troy .
yes , please .
tell your boyfriend and his boyfriend
that playtime is over .
annie , shirley , go find out
what &apos;s keeping leonard on top .
and abed won &apos;t switch back until we get that dvd .
i &apos;ll deal with that .
and then , we are meeting back here
and getting up into some puffy paint
and doing our doable , passable banners !
what do you want me to do ?
stay alive .
or don &apos;t .
i &apos;m on it .
wait , troy !
i &apos;m abed .
oh , right .
uh , &quot; troy , &quot; could you please excuse us ?
you were weird this morning , and now , well , weirder .
are we still on for senor kevin &apos;s
or are you guys doing this whole switchy thing ?
actually , he &apos;s kind of going through some stuff .
oh . is he having some issues
that he &apos;s having trouble dealing with ?
yeah , he kind of needs this , so he &apos;s really laying into it .
oh , so he might need an almost therapist .
perhaps i &apos;ll pencil him in for a session ,
you know , after my date with troy .
see you later , abed .
dean , i need you .
it &apos;s happening . shut the door .
what ?
dean , i need you to give this dvd to troy and abed .
oh , i love those movies !
they should make more of them . they &apos;re a timeless tale .
why can &apos;t you give it to them ?
troy and abed think they switched bodies
while holding onto a freaky friday dvd ,
which , of course , is now mysteriously missing ,
and they can &apos;t switch back until they find it .
now , i &apos;d give them this one myself ,
but they &apos;ll think that i bought it , which i did .
wait . how did they switch bodies ?
well , they held onto the dvd and said ...
i wish i could switch places with you for just one day .
sorry . routine light switch check .
that is not a thing !
what ?
oh , you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
i &apos;m you ?
what ? no ! you &apos;re not .
of course . it &apos;s fricking friday .
there &apos;s no justification to be made ,
because it can &apos;t happen , weirdo .
whatever , dean . now , please leave your office
so i can start to work on your weird body
that i &apos;m now stuck in !
you &apos;re not even holding a phone !
so , troy , how &apos;s abed coping ?
i mean , with his day in your body ?
you &apos;d have to ask him . i , for one , am freaked .
look at his arms and legs .
he &apos;s like the pick @-@ up sticks of people .
do you think he &apos;s trying to hide from something
he &apos;s not understanding ?
if you &apos;re worried about abed , you should talk to him .
right . i should talk to him .
well , well , well .
john &quot; mc @-@ lame . &quot;
never thought i &apos;d see your face again .
back for more , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry , back for what ?
punishment .
last time i saw you ,
you got your panties all in a wad
&apos;cause i said die hard was a suckfest of a movie .
wait , what ? you hate die hard ?
that sounds insane to me .
it is , without a doubt ,
the most unnecessary movie ever made .
i &apos;m not who you think i am , man .
what else do you hate about the movie ?
&apos;cause i would love to hear all of your opinions .
well , i mean , where to even start ?
it &apos;s riddled with plot holes . there &apos;s no logic to it .
i would rather watch a napkin sit and do nothing all day
than to even endure the trailer for die dard !
wow , that &apos;s hatred .
babe , we should order .
i &apos;m both starving and another word for wanting food .
troy !
oh , thank god , you &apos;ve come to your senses .
you answered to troy .
we &apos;re in public . i have to . i &apos;m abed .
of course you are .
well , abed , i found the dvd . you can switch back now .
nice try . that &apos;s the remake .
in the original , the mom and daughter simply exclaimed ,
&quot; i wish i could switch places with you for just one day , &quot;
like we did .
in that one , there &apos;s a magic fortune cookie .
oh , i always wondered what the differences were .
listen , why don &apos;t i pitch you a remake of a remake ,
where my magic mouth tells you drop the act
because abed isn &apos;t even here .
then , you cough up the dvd
and we go tell abed you &apos;re back in your own bodies ,
so we can go do doable and passable banners .
first , that &apos;s a terrible movie .
second , i understand why you &apos;re frustrated ,
it &apos;s in your nature , but this is happening .
this happened . so , unless we find that dvd ...
oh , no , let &apos;s go find this dvd .
by all means , let &apos;s waste more of my life .
now , we were the last ones to leave the study room last night .
maybe one of the janitors took it .
great . let &apos;s go find that janitor .
maybe you can switch bodies with him ,
or maybe with his magic mop ...
stop pitching . it &apos;s not your thing .
you &apos;re right , that &apos;s ridiculous ,
unlike what we &apos;re doing .
dean ?
yeah , come in .
i &apos;d stop what i &apos;m doing ,
but then i &apos;d be depriving you of the view .
you &apos;re welcome . what &apos;s up ?
um , is this a bad time ?
uh , i &apos;m in greendale , stuck in the body
of a man who could be gollum &apos;s shadow ,
so yeah , i &apos;d say it &apos;s half past suck .
totally .
&quot; half past suck . &quot; that &apos;s funny .
okay . that &apos;s creepy .
uh , dean .
we &apos;re losing to leonard in the race of valedictorian ,
and we were wondering if we could take a peek at
his transcripts to see how that is even possible .
are you serious ?
you mean put my integrity on the line ?
you want me to jeopardize the very reputation
of this school that i &apos;ve spent so long protecting ?
you &apos;re right . we &apos;re sorry .
and that is what i would be saying if i gave a crap .
awesome !
ah , here &apos;s the answer .
back in 1968,
leonard got an &quot; a &quot; in rotary phone maintenance .
since then , he &apos;s been taking every other class pass / fail
to keep a perfect gpa .
well , what does this mean ?
it means we &apos;re taking an old man down .
you &apos;re welcome .
what is wrong with you ?
i don &apos;t know .
how &apos;s your bean burrito ?
good . thank you for ordering for me .
i know what you always get .
yeah , you know me so well .
i know a lot about you .
i know you grind your teeth at night , it keeps me up .
i know about your tattoo .
which one ?
the greenpeace one you haven &apos;t gotten yet
because you &apos;re afraid of needles .
did troy tell you these things ?
i am troy .
well , it must upset abed to hear all of this relationship talk .
he doesn &apos;t seem to care .
maybe .
but maybe he doesn &apos;t like talking to you about us .
i could see that causing him to act out .
nah , i don &apos;t see that .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s that invested in us .
but he talks to you about us .
i talk to him .
what do you say when you talk to him about us ?
do you tell him that things are good ?
i don &apos;t know . are they ?
well , what you think ?
well ,
i guess i wonder why we didn &apos;t remember our anniversary .
not everybody &apos;s annie .
no , but i don &apos;t know .
seems like , you know , that would be special to us ,
like , especially if things were good .
something we &apos;d want to celebrate .
well , we are .
are we ?
yes , lord brickell ,
i was indeed down by the stables .
damn , man . you ever heard of knocking ?
yup , just heard it , when i did it a second ago .
they &apos;ve seen too much ! let &apos;s kill them !
stand down , crazy schmidt .
what we &apos;re doing here is none of their business .
we &apos;re having murder mystery night during the day .
i was fine with &quot; none of your business . &quot;
we &apos;re looking for a freaky friday dvd .
oh , i love those movies . they should make more of those ...
nope . we left it in study room &quot; f &quot; last night .
well , everything we find goes straight to the lost and found .
great , show us .
and the &quot; wasting my life &quot; tour continues .
leonard !
we just looked at your transcript .
i knew this day would come . i &apos;m outta here .
there you go . my work here is done .
you &apos;re one and two again .
now , you can direct your anger and resentment at each other .
congrats .
classic wrap @-@ up .
shut up , leonard !
i &apos;ve got a picture of your old nose !
it was a lateral move !
dean !
dean ...
annie .
why is this happening ?
holy ... makes complete sense at this school !
fyi , one of these piles is load @-@ bearing ,
so , uh , yeah , watch that .
jeez .
this is gonna be harder than i thought .
this dvd isn &apos;t gonna find itself .
and neither are we , troy , because it &apos;s not in here ,
and you know that .
this is dumb .
why are you so committed to this bit ?
if you &apos;re really a friend to abed , to me ,
then you &apos;ll end it , now .
sorry . i have to keep going , for troy .
you don &apos;t have to dig through all this stuff . i will .
i know it isn &apos;t your problem .
i &apos;m just glad i &apos;m here .
this is the sweeter end of the deal .
troy still has to go on his date with britta .
i don &apos;t understand this whole relationship thing
or why troy would even want to be in one .
how long have you felt this way ?
or at least ,
how long have you been talking to abed about this ?
not that long . it &apos;s more lately , i guess .
it &apos;s felt different ,
like we &apos;re working at it too hard .
and he doesn &apos;t think it should be .
it should be easy , but he says it isn &apos;t .
it feels like we &apos;re just going through the motions .
because he &apos;s afraid if he doesn &apos;t , it just ends .
then what ? what if they &apos;re not friends anymore ?
he &apos;d hate that . he &apos;d hate himself .
i don &apos;t want to lose what we had .
so he &apos;s here , at this point , not knowing how to talk to her ,
not knowing how to tell her that he wants to break up .
wait , are you breaking up with me ?
i think so ?
i &apos;m sorry , jeff . i shouldn &apos;t have brought you down here ,
into any of this .
especially for a bit . i know you don &apos;t respect them .
that &apos;s true . they &apos;re dumb , and i stand by that ,
but committing to them isn &apos;t .
i wish i had the courage
to commit to a bit like you , abed ,
or to a relationship , like troy .
committing is hard ,
because we &apos;re all scared of what happens
when we find out we committed to the wrong thing ,
but there &apos;s no shame in what troy &apos;s done .
he put himself out there and he really tried ,
and that proves he cares .
that said , and as hard as it may seem ,
right now , troy needs to show he cares .
he needs to put himself out there and own how he feels .
that proves he &apos;s a man .
so ...
yeah , i don &apos;t think this is the way
either of us thought this would go .
no , i can &apos;t say that i did .
i mean , not this , not us here .
but i can say that whenever you guys switch back
to your original bodies , i want to thank abed
for being such a good friend to both of us .
troy , wait . don &apos;t do it like this .
i understand why you had to go high concept ,
because you &apos;re scared , but britta deserves better .
troy , it &apos;s time .
i wish i had my own body back !
sorry , routine light switch check .
oh , i &apos;ve been meaning to see this .
first , the easiest part , because it &apos;s the most obvious .
i &apos;m sorry .
i think i proved today that i &apos;m not ready for this .
i wanted it to work . i did .
i care about you so much ,
and i love being around you .
i just think i &apos;m better as your friend ,
because that i know i can be good at .
so i &apos;m number two again , which is what it is .
but you know , if i &apos;m not going to be valedictorian ,
i &apos;m glad it will be you .
mm , me too .
you mean you hope it &apos;s me if it &apos;s not you ,
or that you &apos;re glad it &apos;s you ?
yes .
thanks for everything you did for me today .
i &apos;m sorry i pulled you into it .
that was my problem , not yours .
it &apos;s the best way someone &apos;s ever woken me up in my life .
how was lunch ?
it was good . it really was .
i &apos;ll tell you about it later .
oh , there you are .
i got bored waiting ,
so i went ahead and did our whole project .
pierce , no offense ,
but banners are kind of my specialt ...
holy ... makes no sense whatsoever .
whole thing took 25 minutes tops .
early weekend ? early weekend ? early weekend ?
guys , i need to apologize for my behavior today .
when i switched bodies with jeffrey ...
nope .
i thought i knew
what it would be like to have jeffrey inside of me ...
that did not happen .
but as it turns out ,
having jeffrey inside of me ...
nope again .
only brought out the worst in me .
which is to say , having jeffrey inside of me ...
no one was inside of anyone !
was wrong ...
to have jeffrey inside of me .
shut up !
so i &apos;m sorry .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i scolded leonard today ,
and according to greendale bylaws ,
i now have to grant him three wishes .
um , we need to get scolded by the dean immediately .
oh man , football is front , that is an interest i have .
also plumming and air conditionaning
are things i think about .
come on , man , what are we ... what &apos;s happening ?
i couldn &apos;t have ... i &apos;m sorry .
keep rolling .
ok , come on .
&apos;feetball &apos; is ... &apos; feetball &apos; ?
&apos;feetball &apos; ?
did i say ...
dorks !
stop doing outtakes ,
you switched bodies last week .
hey guys , i just wanna apologize ...
oh my god . &quot; hey , dean ! walk march ! &quot; am i right ?
i &apos;m sorry , i never do this .
dean , we stopped doing outtakes .
oh , okay .
yeah , we did that .
oh , no worries .
thanks for including me .
