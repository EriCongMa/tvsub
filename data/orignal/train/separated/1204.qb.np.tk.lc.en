we &apos;ll find out where they &apos;re taking him .
and we &apos;ll get you there .
the plan was to get ali out of town tonight
but now that we know that &quot; a &apos;s &quot; after ezra ...
i get that &quot; a &quot; wants to shut ezra up ,
but ali &apos;s still a target .
exactly what is it you want us to do ?
i want us to stick together .
the bigger we are , the harder she falls .
oh , my god .
look at her !
are you okay ?
what happened ?
i saw mrs. dilaurentis in the woods ,
and i tried to follow her .
she was giving a suitcase to somebody ,
and i thought maybe it was ali .
jason , what &apos;s going on ?
i kind of need to keep a little space between me and spencer .
why ?
my mom needs me right now , and i &apos;m here to help her .
this isn &apos;t a game .
so what is it ?
justice .
for who ?
jenna .
spencer !
surprise !
hey , shana !
you did what you had to do .
let &apos;s go home .
thanks .
ali , are you okay ?
stop .
you don &apos;t need to run anymore .
&quot; a &quot; is gone . come on .
ali , look ... we talked about this .
you know it &apos;s the right decision .
maybe i should go home first ... speak to my mom .
ali , your mother buried you .
look , i think it &apos;s more important that
the police know you &apos;re alive before your mom does .
hey , yeah . you need to walk in there
and tell them everything .
i mean , about mona being &quot; a , &quot;
shana taking over where mona left off--all of it .
start with the night that you ran away .
no . before that you have to start with the jenna thing .
wait , what ? why ?
she has to .
shana was after us for payback for what happened to jenna .
i can &apos;t do this . i can &apos;t .
you can . okay , you &apos;re not in this alone .
&quot; a &quot; tortured all of us , and what happened to shana--
happened because of me .
and i can handle that part . i think .
but , ali , look , you &apos;re gonna have to cover the rest .
ali .
are we in agreement ?
are you detective holbrook ?
i am .
i think you &apos;ve been looking for me .
i &apos;m--
i know who you are .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re with your friends . welcome home .
i &apos;m guessing you have a lot to tell me .
maybe we can begin with the night that you disappeared .
i didn &apos;t disappear .
i was kidnapped .
i was kidnapped and held hostage for two years ,
and if it weren &apos;t for my friends ,
i wouldn &apos;t be standing here . they saved my life .
we don &apos;t know who took this photo , but it is dated ,
so i &apos;m assuming this wasn &apos;t your first visit home .
do you have any memory of this night ?
it was the night that i got away from him .
from your captor ?
how ?
i jumped out of the car .
while you were blindfolded ?
yeah , i tore it off , and i ran straight into the woods
so that he couldn &apos;t catch me .
but on the night of this photo ,
you managed to make it back to rosewood and ...
you found your friends .
i asked them to hide me .
you thought that they would be more helpful than the police ?
your parents ?
i was scared .
okay , i was scared that if i came back home
and i was out in the open that he &apos;d find me again .
so how did you protect her ?
they hid me in the woods .
in a shed that we all used to hang out in .
after school , the weekends .
but you just said that they came to your rescue in philadelphia .
dad !
oh , my god !
dad .
was i sleeping on that bus ?
when did we discuss kidnapping ?
we didn &apos;t .
why is it just her dad ?
where is her mother ?
i don &apos;t know .
emily , call your mother .
her flight from dallas was canceled because of the storms .
you &apos;re welcome to stay here as long as you need to .
thank you .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll call her from outside .
hold it .
where are you going ?
i am so tired .
i just wanted to go upstairs and take a shower--
and go to bed ? really ?
without telling me where you &apos;ve been for the past few days ?
you might have a hard time falling asleep
if i &apos;m poking you every five seconds with a new question .
you knew alison was alive for over a month
and you never said a word ?
i didn &apos;t mean to--
why would you keep this kind of secret ?
because we made a promise .
well , you obviously didn &apos;t think it through .
did you ?
because there &apos;s still a dead girl
in alison &apos;s grave that the police--
i don &apos;t know who that is . and i had nothing to do with it ,
and whether you believe me or not , mom , that is the truth .
wait .
i &apos;m not accusing you of anything right now but poor judgment .
while you were gone ,
your father and i were dragged down to that precinct .
what ? where &apos;s dad ?
in philly .
they found your car and impounded it .
he went down there with melissa to get it out .
wait ! melissa &apos;s here ?
is she back from london ?
oh , yes ! and don &apos;t expect any souvenirs ,
because all she brought back was attitude .
and secrets .
go on get ready for bed .
did you ever plan on telling me the truth ?
of course i did .
but we had to wait until it felt safe .
you feel that way now ?
yeah . kind of .
how ?
the person who did this to alison is still out there .
is this cheese old ?
it &apos;s havarti .
does it melt ?
all cheese melts , hanna .
hey ! look at me .
how did you feel when you found out alison was still alive ?
what do you mean ?
sweetie .
you have kept a lot of secrets from me ,
but this one is right up there with the manhattan project .
the what ?
i don &apos;t understand how you got up in the morning ,
went to school , knowing that alison was still in danger .
that poor girl must just be--
mom , she wants to move on . okay ?
and the more people talk about it and ask a billion questions ,
the harder it &apos;s gonna be for her !
yes , it was a nightmare ,
but it &apos;s over and she needs it to end .
sit down , okay ? i &apos;ll make this for you .
yes . it &apos;s fitz . f @-@ i @-@ t @-@ z.
he got admitted on saturday and he had surgery .
yeah , come in .
oh ! i thought you were dad .
no . he &apos;s downstairs . hey ...
is it true ?
is alison alive and back in her house ?
wow . that &apos;s insane .
i heard dad telling mom
that some freak had her blind @-@ folded , and--
it &apos;s not a video game , mike .
i &apos;m not making a joke .
she &apos;s tough . i &apos;m kind of surprised
she didn &apos;t kill the creep with her bare hands .
just stop .
please ! stop .
why is mr. fitz in the hospital ?
what ?
the door is made of wood , not plutonium .
he &apos;s in new york for the weekend , and he got hurt .
what happened ? is he gonna be okay ?
yeah . he &apos;s gonna be fine .
i saw him yesterday . he is gonna be just fine .
wait . you said he was in new york .
how did you see him if you guys were in philly ?
i didn &apos;t see him . i spoke to him .
look , mike , i &apos;m exhausted , so i &apos;m gonna go to sleep .
she never saw this person , mom .
she only heard his voice .
i--i guess he had her locked in a room or ...
i don &apos;t know .
look , can we talk about this later ? please .
okay .
yeah . i love you , too .
bye .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s not ?
we made a pact , emily .
&quot; a &quot; is finally dead ,
and we were all ready to get back to our lives ,
and now all of a sudden we &apos;re back on planet alison .
okay , spencer--
it &apos;s like it &apos;s 9th grade all over again ,
and we are here on &quot; the whirly girlie ride . &quot;
and ali goes rogue , and we &apos;re just expected to backup her story .
you &apos;re even adding to the lie .
why is she still controlling us ?
maybe she flipped last minute
because she wanted to protect her mom .
maybe she wanted to hear why her mom did what she did
before it gets forced out of her by the police .
are you really gonna stay here and defend ali right now ?
i am not ...
okay . is it just me or it &apos;s really a weird time to detail your car .
does jason not know that she is home ?
of course he knows .
the only question is why would you be squee @-@ gee @-@ ing your backseat
if your sister just got back from the dead ?
what is that ?
her phone ?
who sent you this ?
hey , you there ...
i was thinking maybe you wanna sleep downstairs tonight ,
you won &apos;t have to be in here by yourself .
it &apos;s okay , dad .
i &apos;ve been dreaming about this moment for a long time-
sleeping in my own bed .
i understand ... i just ...
i don &apos;t think i can ever let you out of my sight again .
have you heard from mom ?
ah , your brother and i had been trying to reach her ,
i can &apos;t say i &apos;m not worried , because i am .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s fine .
alison ,
i know this is maybe asking for too much ,
but @-@ um ... i want you to feel safe .
i &apos;ve asked the police to put up a barrier
at the end of the street .
lot of people are gonna wanna hear your story ,
but you don &apos;t have to leave this house or talk to anybody
until you &apos;re ready .
i , um ...
i can &apos;t give you those years back .
alison , i can &apos;t , but
i promise i will do everything i can
to help you forget them .
do you remember this ?
i &apos;ve had it my wallet since the night we lost you .
this is the little girl i refuse to let go off .
honey i need you to know that
your mom and i-
we aren &apos;t living together anymore .
uh ... we decided a few months ago to get a divorce .
i know . emily told me .
i &apos;m sorry , dad .
so am i.
she &apos;s dead !
hanna what &apos;s going on ?
i have no idea @-@ i mean , who do you think sent it ?
sent what ?
hold on- emily and spencer seriously didn &apos;t tell you ?
not tell me what ?
we thought you were freaked out
about everything still .
uh ... ha .. hanna , talk to me .
ali got a message on her phone ,
she saw it when she opened up her purse at the police station ,
that &apos;s why she lied to holbrook .
a message from &quot; a ? &quot;
&quot; a &quot; is dead , aria . remember ?
hanna , honey you still up ?
i got to go .
good morning . may i come in ?
of course .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
please . you are not bothering me .
i &apos;ve been thinking about your family .
ashley , i need your help .
okay .
can i offer you some coffee ?
i can &apos;t imagine what this must be like for you and jessica .
have you heard from her ?
no .
i didn &apos;t go to office today .
our daughter is alive and home .
and her own mother isn &apos;t there to greet her .
where is she ?
i have to believe . jessica doesn &apos;t know that alison &apos;s home .
you know the things have not been good between me and her .
she changed the password on her business account .
if you could go through her email .
oh ! i @-@ i don &apos;t know if i could do that .
is there a chance jason might know where she is ?
oh ! forget about jason .
may be he is in a state of shock
or maybe his brain is so deadened
from drugs that he can &apos;t act like a human being anymore .
he hasn &apos;t shed a tear since he saw his sister .
i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s shock .
please ...
help me .
what are you doing ?
ali , you can &apos;t be out here .
there is about 10 cars at the end of our street . alright ?
press , police .
i &apos;m not twerking through town .
okay ?
i just wanna sit on my porch .
you haven &apos;t asked me any questions .
how come ?
figured you might need your space .
what was mom &apos;s reaction ?
when she found out i was still alive ?
she was stunned . what do you expect ?
get inside .
can i help you ?
i &apos;ve an appointment with mrs. dilaurentis .
who are you ?
kathy paras . county shelter .
we arranged to bring puppy over this morning .
mrs. dilaurentis wants to adopt him .
sit .
good , boy .
my mother didn &apos;t order this .
it &apos;s a dog , cowboy , not a pizza .
and she did .
he is so smart .
yeah .
why was he at the shelter ?
oh ! he &apos;s got issues mostly with men .
put him back in the van .
now !
what happens to him if we don &apos;t take him ?
basically , mrs. d. was last stop on his train .
it &apos;s not pretty .
do you need any help ?
no .
i got it .
hey , you heard about alison , right ?
she &apos;s alive .
pretty twisted what happened to her .
quite a story .
that psycho is probably circling this town
looking for his next victim .
which is why we need to fight back .
what &apos;s in the box ?
whistles .
i ordered one for every girl in the school .
and i &apos;m asking the principal
to get us all special apps for our phones .
it &apos;s either this or we all hire full @-@ time bodyguards .
yeah . i would apply for that job
if you could stand being around me that much .
i gotta go . principal hackett is waiting for me .
mona ...
i miss you .
em ?
wait up . my mom said us to stay close to home .
i am not going to school .
i &apos;m just giving ali &apos;s phone back to her .
hanna told the aria about the text .
why would she do that ?
because she &apos;s hanna .
and now aria is freaked out .
she thinks a is back and she &apos;s one text away
from being turned into the police .
a is dead .
yeah , i know that . but--
but part of me thinks that
that text was jenna &apos;s way of welcoming alison home .
we can handle jenna and others ,
five of us and one of her .
yeah , but we killed that hers ... her .
what are you doing ?
we never looked last night to see what jason threw out ,
and we probably should have- look at this ,
when was jason in new york ?
that &apos;s why no rush .
sorry , you channeling your filipino grandmother right now ?
to see alison .
we @-@ we knew that his whole visit
to rehab was a big fat lie .
what if he is been following her for weeks ?
what if mrs. d &apos;s had him tracking her for months , years .
do you think jason sent that text ?
spencer , if ali told the whole truth ,
her mother would go down .
if mrs. d thought that someone just killed her child ,
who else would she cover for
besides her other one ?
ali . it can &apos;t be coincidence ,
jason came back from new york the same night as us .
he was in my room last night , watching me sleep .
jason ?
oh my god !
you can &apos;t stay here tonight ,
you need to tell your dad you wanna sleep at spencer &apos;s .
it &apos;s never gonna to happen .
i mean , he won &apos;t even let me walk to the freaking mailbox .
where are you in this , spencer ?
you haven &apos;t even said a word .
should i be afraid of our big brother ?
i know you told him . don &apos;t sweat it .
i &apos;m even starting to think that my dad knows too .
so you think jason is the one
that slammed that rock in my head ?
i mean , is that why my mom has just magically disappeared
as soon as i decide to come home ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
and you were needling both of our families with that secret ,
they probably both wanted you to shut up .
so you think that &apos;s why he went after me ?
i can &apos;t say for sure , but if your mom did choose him over you
she had every reason to make the rest of us look bad ,
and we &apos;ve been framed as pathological liars
ever since then .
so if we ever did find out who hit you ,
nobody would even believe us .
wow . you really have given it some thought .
look , my mom comes back tomorrow .
you can stay with us .
emily , i just got back ,
my dad &apos;s not going to let me out for sleepovers .
well , what &apos;re you going to do ?
i have a few ideas .
well , can you let us in on them ?
so that we &apos;re not caught paddling around like idiots
trying to play catch @-@ up ?
i told you , spencer--
i made up that lie to protect aria .
she kind of killed someone , remember ?
you could have consulted us first .
okay , guys , please stop .
what &apos;s done is done .
we need to focus our energy on who &apos;s trying to sink us now .
hey , you just got up ?
yeah , what you &apos;re doing ?
i &apos;m , um ...
doing some work for alison &apos;s father .
he wants me to get a lead on where jessica might be .
i &apos;m ... i was about to open up some of her emails ,
and i @-@ i just can &apos;t do this .
why ?
hanna , the last thing i wanna do is get in the middle
of two people who are going through divorce ,
and it &apos;s not just an invasion of privacy ...
it feels like a betrayal .
well , i &apos;m betting mrs. d would rather have you looking
through her emails than the police .
and besides , ali needs her mom right now .
take milk or sugar ?
milk is great .
when did you get back ?
mm @-@ late last night .
this morning @-@ i don &apos;t know i think i had dinner
on two continents .
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
i @-@ i thought i &apos;d come by and see you .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
melissa told your father and me
that she saw toby in london , that &apos;s why she rushed back ,
but apparently that never happened .
what ?
i went to her place , wren answered the door ,
he said he was staying there ,
and she wasn &apos;t in london anymore .
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
oh , if you want , you can call him .
wren ? oh , please ! i &apos;d rather stick a knife in the toaster .
i have a client to meet in town ,
you on the other hand are staying close to home .
is that clear ?
yes .
okay , bye .
bye .
bye .
why did you go to london ?
i wanted answers for you .
i figured if i could get your sister look me in the eye
and tell me something .
something truthful ?
right .
do you know about ...
alison ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve heard some pretty weird stuff
but i &apos;d rather hear it from you .
aria .
sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
just got your text ... i was with ali .
what are you doing ?
if we &apos;ve been out here hiding her for a month
it sure as hell needs start looking like it .
seriously , you can &apos;t do this right now .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
we should have been out here last night filling this
place with crap after alison got that text .
and thank you for keeping me in the dark about that .
what am i ? your child ?
we only did that because you were such a mess
when your dad came to the police station .
yeah and what ?
what you thought if i got a good night &apos;s sleep ,
i &apos;d just wake up in candy land ?
okay , aria calm down .
that text wasn &apos;t from &quot; a. &quot;
how do you know that ?
because i was there when shana @-@ slash @-@ a was killed .
look ... spencer was right .
it &apos;s one thing not to contradict ali &apos;s story
and it &apos;s another to add to it .
we can &apos;t go down that rabbit hole again .
yeah , well , i can &apos;t do nothing , all right ?
because if &quot; a &quot; knows that i took down shana ,
aria ...
i &apos;m going to be the ...
shana had been using us as target practice for months ,
what you did was purely self @-@ defense .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
someone is dead .
all right , and she will never be able to recover or apologize
or even graduate from high school because i killed her .
i killed her , emily , and i don &apos;t know
how i &apos;m gonna be able to live with that .
aria ...
in that moment , it was you or her .
i went through this after ...
nate .
you think that no one can understand what this feels like ,
but i &apos;ve been there .
remember , we used to sneak out here ?
our biggest problem was how to eat peanut butter with braces .
is there enough paper in that printer ?
yeah there should be a couple of pages in there ,
do you want me to get you some more ?
no , that &apos;s all right . i &apos;ll get it .
the next time you go to london ...
yeah .
you &apos;re taking me with you .
and we &apos;re never coming back .
what &apos;s so pressing that you have to leave ?
what &apos;s in philly ? or should i ask , who ?
i need to drop something off to a friend .
right now ?
i said after dinner .
your sister has been gone for nearly a ...
then i will wait till she goes asleep , okay ?
what makes you think she can sleep ?
her mother is still not here , and i am thinking
you &apos;re the only one who knows where she is .
think what you want . i don &apos;t .
jason , every time someone in this family
walks out of this house it &apos;s a news story
and the last thing i want is you speaking to a damn reporter .
don &apos;t worry , dad ...
i won &apos;t embarrass you anymore than i already have .
emily ... i didn &apos;t know you were here .
ali asked me to take pepe for a walk .
whose dog is that ?
you brought home a dog ?
it was dropped off this morning .
mom rescued him from the shelter .
really ? well ! maybe when you go to philly you can tell her
there is more than a dog waiting for her back home .
i can &apos;t do anymore .
are you gonna to go for it ?
no , go ahead .
you wanted it .
hello , aria .
hey , where have you been ?
dad told me to order dinner .
there is a veggie ...
i &apos;m not hungry .
were you walking around in the dark all by yourself ?
excuse me ?
given what happened to alison
i can &apos;t believe you would walk to the curb
without a police escort .
hey , i borrowed this ... again .
what do you mean you borrowed it ?
as in , i didn &apos;t take it and keep it .
why would you borrow it at all ?
&apos;cause i needed to put some music together
for a social studies project .
it was that ...
that violin music . was that coming from your room
last night ?
i guess ...
sorry . i will grab my jacket and take you home .
you can drop me at the library .
i still have some research to do .
mona ?
yeah ?
you doing your research in the library or in this house ?
your brother invited me to dinner .
but i am actually really glad to see you
because i can give you this in person .
go on take it .
i &apos;ve got hundreds more .
if anything else , we can use what happened to alison
as a wakeup call , nobody is safe .
what are you trying to prove , mona ?
is this a threat ?
no , it &apos;s a whistle .
you put it between your lips and blow .
we all know where you were the night that alison disappeared .
she told us about the time you spent together
at the lost woods motel room .
you have a few stories of your own to keep quiet , don &apos;t you ?
tell me ... how is mr. fitz doing ?
will he make a full recovery ?
can i have the car keys ?
aria .
there is a meditation center that mrs. d once went to ,
you can try calling there ...
thank you , hanna , and thank your mother for me .
we were just about to have dinner .
if you girls want to join us ?
sure .
we @-@ we can &apos;t tonight .
right . maybe tomorrow .
anytime .
what &apos;s going on ? why can &apos;t i eat dinner ?
just get in the car . i &apos;ve to show you something .
it &apos;s an update on mrs. d.
ali &apos;s dad thinks he &apos;s hiding her in philly .
wait , who &apos;s hiding her ?
jason .
jason told his dad he had to drop something off to
a friend in philly .
could that be code for new york ?
what is this ?
mrs. d wrote that email the night that she escaped town ,
but she never sent it .
it says , i can &apos;t protect you anymore .
who would she have written that to ?
what &apos;s up , jason ?
i just saw what you delivered .
your dad asked my mother ...
yeah , well , my mother didn &apos;t .
so , maybe it is time people stay the hell out of places
they don &apos;t belong .
that includes you .
follow him .
no , you follow him . i have to change my underwear .
hanna , hurry up . okay ?
he might be going to see his mother .
hurry up !
there is no way his mom &apos;s in there .
mrs. d wouldn &apos;t even walk down this street .
why not ?
if she &apos;s hiding out she &apos;s not going to be doing it
at the four seasons .
we need to ring the buzzer he pressed .
maybe mrs. d will answer . come on ...
was it this one ? or was it , was it that one ?
who are you looking for ?
well , can i help you ?
i @-@ i ... i heard that there might be a vacancy
available for a sub @-@ let .
sub @-@ let ?
who @-@ who ... who told you that , huh ?
but , who are you ?
a real estate agent ? get out of here .
now !
both of youse . go !
you don &apos;t want to get that ?
no .
someone really wants to reach you .
well , they can wait .
spence , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
does it have to do with alison ?
no .
is this about melissa ?
no .
did you follow me ?
i &apos;m not supposed to be out of my house ,
but i had to come here to say goodbye .
the girl they made that for , she really is gone .
i can &apos;t be that person anymore , mona .
i know you hated me
and wanted me to go straight to hell .
going there is easy ...
it &apos;s the coming back that &apos;s hard ...
but you and me ... we , we understand each other .
i need you , mona .
as a friend .
the truth will bury you in a new york minute .
in case you &apos;re wondering ,
that was me , i sent that text .
i guess i should have signed my name because
i don &apos;t have to pretend to be anyone else anymore .
i don &apos;t have to hide . you do .
and you &apos;re gonna wish you stayed dead .
i &apos;m going to the cops tonight , i have to .
you guys ... i @-@ i can &apos;t hold on to this .
aria , breathe .
can you please wait
and discuss this with all of us here ?
where is spencer ?
she went next door to distract mr. dilaurentis
so we could sneak ali over here .
she better haul us because i &apos;m guessing
jason is not making too many more stops tonight .
guys , please , enough with jason for a minute .
mona knows that we were in new york . don &apos;t you understand ?
okay , it &apos;s only a matter of time before she runs out of whistles
and start tearing our balloons and say aria killed shana .
okay , whistles ?
aria , stop . okay .
mona does not know about shana .
then who does ? who ? who is screwing with me ?
and you keep me telling me that &quot; a &quot; is dead .
&quot; a &quot; is dead , aria .
then why am i hearing a violin in my backyard ?
who &apos;s the fiddler on my freaking roof ?
hey , aria , listen to us . jason was the one in new york .
once we can prove that he is a threat that made ali
tell that kidnapping lie then ...
but how &apos;re we doing that ?
i don &apos;t know , that &apos;s why we &apos;re having a meeting .
once the police are on to mrs. d and jason ,
then everything we &apos;ve done can be explained
