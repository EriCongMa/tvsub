he owes me half that load . - you &apos;re not buying it ?
i don &apos;t know what to think .

in essex county this afternoon ,
an incident of sports rage among soccer moms
led to the arrest of a verona woman with ties to the mafia .
our gillian glessner was on the scene .
think that other mother better go into the soccer @-@ mom protection programme ?
maybe she should , carl . it started here at summit avenue park
during a nine @-@ and ten @-@ year @-@ olds &apos; soccer match .
an altercation between soccer moms
sent one mother to the hospital and one to jail .
denise mccarthy , a parent , witnessed the violence .
i just feel so bad for the kids .
parents taping the match captured the m .
somebodyl how do you like it now , bitch ?
her kid kicked my kidl
charges are pending , but we know ...
that the woman shown here being taken into custody is janice baccalieri ,
sister of reputed new jersey mob boss anthony soprano .
guess you could call it a mafia @-@ related hit .
we spoke with psychologist bela kakuk .
it &apos;s a growing problem in our society .
are particularly prone to rage.psychologists are finding that certain individuals
almost any frustration , inconvenience
or perceived inconsideration will set them off .
motherfucker !
janice , open the door !
where is she ?
it wasn &apos;t my fault !
my name was all over the fuckin &apos; tv because of your bullshit !
it &apos;s not that simple . the woman &apos;s kid was picking on sophia .
why didn &apos;t they collar her ? - i am suing the township
for wrongful arrest and the yso .
no . no , you &apos;re not !
what you &apos;re gonna do is call neil mink , play it down , pay the fine
and not turn this into one of your causes cres .
anybody &apos;s side but mine . that bitch is lucky i didn &apos;t kill her .
well , we know that .
what ?
you and your fuckin &apos; temper .
get out !
this is the end of it .
get out !
i know this looks bad .
on the other hand , she called sophia her daughter .
i don &apos;t give a fuck .
all right , i do give a fuck .
but how many times i gotta tell you ? get control of your wife !
i &apos;m so embarrassed .
i don &apos;t wanna see any of my friends again .
well , when you &apos;re a parent , you &apos;ll see .
you &apos;ll defend your children like a lion with her cubs .
you &apos;re not my parent .

janice , i think you need professional help .
i &apos;ll be having an extra session with sandy , believe me .
what does she do ? tells you you were picked on by your father
and asks you to read her screenplays .
i think there &apos;s anger specialists .
you should see a weight @-@ loss specialist .
you don &apos;t see it in yourself . i heard you with sophia .
you were getting along so much better ,
she says one little thing and you get nasty .
i &apos;m so sore .
this is not an isolated incident .
they won &apos;t let you shop up at the corner anymore .
those coffee beans were burnt . you tasted them .
janice , i like a spitfire type ,
i told you , but we can &apos;t live like this , me and the kids.like what ?
this was a nice house .
peaceful ... i don &apos;t know . there wasn &apos;t all this yelling and tension .
how could you understand ?
your dad was a sweetheart ,
even when he had emphysema .
my house ... it was dog eat dog .
well , be that as it may , the past and all ,
if you don &apos;t go to these anger classes they have or whatever ,
this with us ain &apos;t gonna work out .
what do you think he clears here ?
two craps tables , blackjack , roulette .
you gotta figure he &apos;s grabbing anywhere from 2,500 to five gs a night for himself .
it used to be you , didn &apos;t it ?
teacher &apos;s pet ?
stop making meatballs , paulie .
i &apos;m just saying .

if somebody opened the canned fruit .
so you and your cousin here will take care of it .
i &apos;ll do it .
i &apos;m worried about the old guy .
i told ya , i &apos;ll do it .
my old man &apos;s got a few jars up there also .
could make problems for my uncle .
it &apos;s gonna be a lotta work ,
which with louise around can only be done at night .
that &apos;s true .
thing &apos;s gotta be done in two weeks .
bulldozers are coming .
are you picking out wedding cakes ? - yeah .
hope you have better luck than i did .
you didn &apos;t like your cake ?
i think your luck &apos;s been fuckin &apos; great , and listen to you cursing it out .
what , you got something you wanna say ?
all right .
so call me .
who is this uncle pat anyway ?
he was a knock @-@ around guy like tony &apos;s dad ,
but they let him retire to this farm upstate new york .
it sounds funny , but it wasn &apos;t . he had the hiccups for like a year .
jeez .
great guy . he had a daughter , but she lived with her mom .
us boys each got sent up there summers when we hit up 12 or 13 .
he &apos;d school us .
did he have the hiccups ? - i told ya that went away .
you think it &apos;s fuckin &apos; funny ?
he almost committed suicide because of it .
how would you like it ?
where &apos;s my barney &apos;s underpants with ventilated cotton ?
still in the dryer .
tell ya one thing ,
i need fuckin &apos; tony b up there like i need a third nut .
all this resentment.- he is your cousin . - yeah ?
should &apos;ve seen him when i was little ... him and tony both .
how they broke my balls , teased me .
one time , i was spending the summer up at uncle pat &apos;s farm
just like they used to - i was 11 .
they came up - they were like 19 - to shoot guns .
they didn &apos;t take me with &apos; em , and when i found &apos; em ,
they said i had to be initiated into a special club
by being tied to a tree alone in the orchard for an hour .
i was on that tree till three in the fuckin &apos; morning .
i worshipped these two guys ... tony soprano especially .
when he was by himself , he used to push me on my big wheels ,
he &apos;d teach me curse words .
when he was by himself .
where &apos;s the tinactin ?
right on the night table .
and here we are again . tony b goes wrong ,
and tony lays a 200k @-@ a @-@ year cash cow on him .
christopher , don &apos;t get mad , ok ?
i know we kinda touched on it a couple times , but you &apos;re so unhappy .
what if we left here ,
went far away , and you went into something else ?
like what ?
i don &apos;t know , like ...
pick up your writing maybe ?
male modelling ...
i &apos;ll get back to the writing some day ,
but from a position of great wealth .
as far as male modelling , i &apos;d probably be a success ,
but i wouldn &apos;t want to be around those people .
i &apos;m a soldier , adriana . when are you gonna understand that ?
what the fuck ?
carmela . - what ? there &apos;s no water in the pool .
yeah , i had it drained .
the electricity costs a fortune.you &apos;re the only one who uses it .
we were getting along better .
so , you polluted all the decent lawyers in new jersey so they can &apos;t represent me ?
you couldn &apos;t play fair .
i didn &apos;t want it !
let &apos;s just pretend that you weren &apos;t begging for it
in a million different ways , ok , because i am worn out here .
he &apos;s a nice kid , finn , right ?
right .
we gonna throw &apos; em an engagement party or what ?
if we can be civil .
she &apos;s so young .
same age we were .
it wasn &apos;t all bad .
last time , i asked you to jot down one or two situations
or people that trigger your anger ,
so when you think about it ,
you get angry all over again - anybody ?
let &apos;s give bradley a chance this time .
my partner parked me in again . i couldn &apos;t find the keys .
i had to wake him up and he starts yelling at me . describe the feelings .
my stepkids do that all the time .
they leave their bikes in the garage
and if i wanna pull in , i gotta get out
and move the bikes with a car full of groceries .
doris , can &apos;t you keep billy &apos;s bike out of the driveway ? !
it &apos;s a famous commercial from the &apos; 60s . bufferin .
guy has a headache and he takes it out on his wife .
back to bradley ,
i &apos;m trying to get into his physical sensations of anger .
he saw red . who wouldn &apos;t ?
she &apos;s right . why is he in here ?
why isn &apos;t his roommate in therapy for selfishness issues ?
there are always things that are irritating and out of our control .
what we can control is our response to those triggers .
so people get a free pass ... the whole world ?
i told you about my supervisor ... checking my work and nobody else &apos;s ?
i wonder why .
cos you &apos;re a minority .
exactly . that &apos;s why i &apos;m in here .
you seem angry about evelyn &apos;s problem .
it makes me mad .
it doesn &apos;t make you mad . you make you mad .
i come from a biased family , but i was different .
i put all my faith and my hopes into the civil rights movement .
i left home and i marched .
and for what ? so they could ride around in their suvs ,
blasting that rap shit and you can &apos;t say anything because they might have guns ?
wait a fuckin &apos; minute . who &apos;s they ?
if the shoe fits .
this is fuckin &apos; priceless .
ok , let &apos;s not time @-@ travel here , let &apos;s try to stay in the present .
janice , you &apos;re angry . let &apos;s stay with that .
what are your physical feelings right now ?
i &apos;d like to punch you in the face .
your hands are clenched . did you realise that ?
you &apos;re provoking me to make a point .
maybe that &apos;s your job but i don &apos;t like it . - look at you .
you &apos;re not even listening .
he &apos;s talking to me .
no . you and me , we do most of the talking in here .
the man is trying to say that those people outside ... they do the thing ,
but we &apos;re the ones that get all upset
and start carrying on.that &apos;s all he &apos;s saying .
the hudson valley .
that legend of sleepy hollow
cartoon scared the piss outta me when i was a kid .
would you mind watching your shoe ?
oh , sure .
it &apos;s a $ 50,000 vehicle . i don &apos;t want it scuffed up .
uncle pat &apos;s farm ?
when you &apos;re 12 , 13 , man , it &apos;s like fuckin &apos; heaven , right ?
running around in the woods , driving that tractor .
he made me clear the brush by the fence with a fuckin &apos; scythe , though .
i had to do that . tony too .
and water his fuckin &apos; tomatoes and his basinigol &apos; .
changed , though , you know , pat &apos;s ,
after louise came back there to live .
it wasn &apos;t just you and pat and his great stories .
they used to call me ichabod crane .
who ?
some very sorry people , that &apos;s who .
the carmela front ? did you two ever discuss that evening you made love ?
it was a one @-@ time deal . i &apos;ve moved on .
what about the depression ?
your revelation about your cousin , his prison sentence ?
you were very upset .
tell you the truth , i haven &apos;t had a lot of time to think about that .
my sister ...
she attacked some woman at her stepkid &apos;s soccer game .
you &apos;ve mentioned her temper before .
she got charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest .
excellent .
let &apos;s talk about that .
what ?
rage .
why ?
depression is rage turned inward .
tell me about the soprano temper .
the thing is , it &apos;s bad for business .
clouds your judgment . john , he always had a terrible temper .
john ?
gotti .
and in the end , i think it hurt him .
see , we forget that in the old days , the ones that came over ,
that started this thing ,
they didn &apos;t get mad .
they just smiled and nodded and made sure you got it later .
that &apos;s the whole beautiful point .
you know what they say . revenge is like serving cold cuts .
i think it &apos;s , &quot; revenge is a dish best served cold . &quot;
so , what &apos;d i say ?
but why revenge all the time ?
where does it come from ,
this insatiable anger you and your sister share ?
i was wondering when she &apos;d come up ?
your mother ? what about your father ?
you never saw her chop off someone &apos;s finger .
told you about that , didn &apos;t i ? - yes .
jesus , i wish i hadn &apos;t .
why ?
i dress up nice when i come here ...
ok , let &apos;s stick to the subject .
which is what ?
your own intolerance for frustration .
&quot; thank you for holding . your call is important to us . &quot;
if it &apos;s so important to you , answer the phone !
stay with that .
it &apos;s just a level of bullshit !
every fuckin &apos; new idea they come up with to make things better makes things worse .
ok , right , i agree . &quot; the centre cannot hold .
&quot; the falcon cannot hear the falconer . &quot; what the fuck are you talking about ?
we live in a time of technological and spiritual crisis ,
but you feel you &apos;re above all of it ,
certainly above any inconvenience or annoyance .
and if things don &apos;t go your way ,
instead of being merely disappointed or inconvenienced , you blow .
my sister &apos;s ...
she &apos;s taking anger @-@ management classes .
maybe she &apos;s on the right track .
is this something you &apos;d consider ?
no .
but i &apos;ll admit it &apos;s not good for me , all this fuckin &apos; agitation .
wears me out . i &apos;m fuckin &apos; exhausted all the time .
where did we start off ?
i don &apos;t know .
depression is rage turned inward .
this is nice .
for inner @-@ city kids like me , this was important .
you lived next to the largest mall in new jersey .
it &apos;s over now . she &apos;s sticking me in that home in florida .
that &apos;s the last i &apos;ll ever see of her .
i &apos;ll be right down the road .
i got a beautiful condo .
thinks she &apos;s gonna meet some old , lonely widower .
louise , it &apos;s time for dessert .
i &apos;m getting it .
and do me a favour , be as polite as you are when it &apos;s just the two of us ?
we know where chrissy buried the guy .
but with uncle johnny &apos;s , you gotta help us out .
i &apos;m not exactly sure , but there was two of them .
the johnson brothers .
you don &apos;t remember where ?
it was a long time ago .
we can &apos;t excavate the whole fuckin &apos; place .
cos you know what tony &apos;s gonna say ?
let him come up here and dig then .
please . he &apos;s a heart attack waiting to happen .
that &apos;s no joke . our bodies are 86 % water .
his last blood test , he was 65 % zeppole .
when he first heard the term &quot; pie in the sky , &quot;
he volunteered for the 82nd airborne .
that &apos;s pretty good .
i learned in recovery that he &apos;s just tamping down his feelings by eating .
i should talk to him . it &apos;s a shame , you know .
he was the funnest guy in the world . - when was that ?
he &apos;s got the world by the balls and he acts like everything &apos;s an imposition .
being at the top , he &apos;s isolated himself .
yeah , it &apos;s just him and his money .
hello .
who is this guy , anyway ?
my first . czechoslovakian guy .
this is the second time i &apos;m moving him .
come here , you little fuck .
guys , wait .
come here , you little fuck .
it wasn &apos;t me ...
help ! please , don &apos;t kill me . - what the fuck you running for ?
the night of the 12th , there was a ship
from italy with these containers of vespas .
i don &apos;t know anything about any vespas !
we know they got here . what happened to them ?
i don &apos;t know . i wasn &apos;t here !
well , apparently he says he wasn &apos;t here .
who picked up our motherfuckin &apos; , cocksucking vespas ?
in two seconds , this is going up your ass .
it was the guys from new york . phil leotardo and them .
listen .
thanks for doing this . you didn &apos;t have to .
fuck that . you &apos;re my little cousin .
i think i can imagine what you may be hearing about me
and what happened in new york .
all i can say is , there &apos;s no truth to it.i didn &apos;t think nothing .
and tony putting me in at the casino , i knew people would resent that .
but i went away for a long time , stood up for this family ,
and you , or anybody , can think what they like ,
but i feel i had a little coming to me .
absolutely . i was telling benny that the other day . he was complaining .
and what i said about tony before ?
you know i love him like a brother . - i love him , too .
we saw the guy down the pier . john has the vespas .
to think of how supportive you were of him . that whole little carmine fiasco .
it &apos;s fuckin &apos; payback .
johnny &apos;s got it in his head my cousin had something to do with joey .
johnny should be looking for the real killers
instead of spending all his time on that golf course .
whole fuckin &apos; shipment of cheese coming in next month .
the imported provolone .
i guess we can kiss that goodbye too now , right ?
motherfucker !
what are you doing here ?
my son is a senior here now .
we were electing party chairs for a senior night .
right .
so , how are you ?
fine.cos you were pretty upset when you left and i wanted to call .
i began to really rue what happened ...
i &apos;m going back with my husband . - oh , that &apos;s good .
all the best .
you don &apos;t drink no more ?
clean and sober , 14 months .
yeah , your mother has that problem .
good for you .
that &apos;s right .
what ?
the johnson brothers &apos; bodies .
i know where they are .
over by the fence in the northwest corner ,
because that night i noticed one of my pickers
had stuck a swiss colony bottle upside @-@ down on one of the fenceposts .
and i was plenty goddamn mad they were drinking on the job , i &apos;ll tell you .
it &apos;s still there , the glass bottle .
are you fuckin &apos; sure ?
lunch !
i got for you , chrissy .
thank you .
sandwich ?
beautiful .
this is mail from three fuckin &apos; weeks ago .
the girl didn &apos;t even show up today .
why don &apos;t you get somebody new ?
two classes , she &apos;s telling people how to run their life .
don &apos;t let me stop you from taking your kids to the rink .
you have every right to be mad at me , and i apologise .
i know it &apos;s bad for the family ... for business ... but i &apos;m working on it .
yeah , i know . bobby told me .
so how &apos;s that going ?
anger management ?
it &apos;s the best thing that ever happened to me .
it &apos;s such a relief to let go of all that shit and ...
i never realised what an angry person i was
and how it fed itself .
so they got you on tranquillisers ?
no .
basically , it &apos;s taking responsibility for your anger ,
and learning to recognise your feelings of anger
and that they &apos;re just feelings , you don &apos;t have to act on them .
people want that so they can walk all over you .
a lot of anger is self @-@ importance .
self @-@ importance ?
problems with authority .
dr seepman locks the door promptly at seven .
people wig out if they don &apos;t get in , start banging
on the door . it &apos;s a big lesson .
i was making everybody in my life miserable ,
yelling and screaming , or pouting and feeling victimised ,
but i feel so much better now about everything .
it &apos;s like this great sadness is beginning to lift .
sadness ?
yeah .
well , i &apos;m happy for you . - thank you .
i am .
your bid , chrissy .
you expecting someone ?
there he is !
my god , i don &apos;t believe it .
who &apos;s that ... anthony ?
what &apos;s the matter ? you all right ?
god , you &apos;re big .
look at those shoulders .
jan sends her love and barb , too .
did you eat ?
louise , don &apos;t ask him . he &apos;s a guest . just go get him a plate !
sit down .
you look good .
feel good .
so how we doing ?
took care of mine last night . the johnson brothers we &apos;ll get tonight .
uncle pat was like johnny mnemonic . right , uncle pat ?
we &apos;re playing pinochle . take a hand .
this is the life , huh ?
i &apos;m with you .
yeah , we were just saying that .
to a job well done .
this place hasn &apos;t changed much .
met some pretty nice college girls the other night .
she liked you , miss raven @-@ hair ?
pat seems good , huh ?
louise seems fat .
the human body is 86 % water ,
but louise &apos;s last blood test , she was 65 % zeppole .
that &apos;s a good one .
i knew a guy , when he was gonna eat philly cheese steak ,
the mayor of philly would have to call out the national guard .
what the fuck &apos;s so funny about that ? doesn &apos;t even make sense .
well , he &apos;s drunk . - him ?
no way . he &apos;s in recovery .
if you recover your fuckin &apos; balls , give us a call .
we might like to hang out .
no , seriously , it &apos;s not funny.he &apos;s a 12 @-@ stepper , right ?
well , yeah . you know that . that &apos;s right .
maybe he can take another couple of steps out the door so we could have some fun ?
come on , don &apos;t get pissy now . he &apos;s just having a joke , that &apos;s all .
sobriety &apos;s hard enough without having to get mocked for it .
jesus christ , why don &apos;t you have a fuckin &apos; drink ?
you &apos;re driving everybody crazy with this shit .
the fuckin &apos; higher power yammering and the sweets
and the key lime pie and the ... jesus .
order a fuckin &apos; bullshot , will you ? do me a favour .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t realise i was being a jerkoff .
look , it &apos;s just ... you know , come on .
you &apos;re doing the right thing .
so , how do you like his car ? schwarzenegger &apos;s . pretty great , huh ?
the humvee . yeah , it &apos;s nice .
kinda steep . - you told me you didn &apos;t pay for it .
you gave the guy a hum @-@ job . - for the hum @-@ vee .
maybe he &apos;d like to hum me .
a friend of bill over here ?
fuckin &apos; wits over here.bill ? i &apos;ll say .
that ? that &apos;s not a bill , that &apos;s a beak .
you know ...
that was you he made that joke about , the zeppole content .
on the way home , we can drop him off at beakskill .
well , if beaks could kill , that one certainly would .
i could &apos;ve called you ichabod crane , but i didn &apos;t .
what the fuck &apos;s he talking about ... ichabod crane ?
nothin &apos; .
here &apos;s to the johnson brothers , whoever the fuck they were .
... port newark ...
... but one example .
six million containers enter u.s. ports every year ,
yet fewer than two per cent of them are opened and inspected by u.s. customs .
it is impossible to check every container
without essentially stopping global commerce .
but what keeps officials from sleeping at night
is that terrorists could use shipping containers
to smuggle in a weapon of mass destruction .
it is within the capabilities of islamic fundamentalists
to track a container with a global positioning system
and detonate a nuclear or biological weapon hidden inside .
son of a bitch .
a terrorist could use a shipping container to smuggle himself into the country .
there he is .
what i saw on tv last night . the ports are wide open .
government &apos;s not doing shit .
where &apos;s my butter substitute ?
in front of you .
didn &apos;t you hear what i said ? i knew it was bad .
seven million containers . the news
team put radioactive shit in one of &apos; em .
it wasn &apos;t even detected .
please , my ears .
sit down . sit .
come on . i made eggs .
could &apos;ve been a goddamn a @-@ bomb .
you want coffee ?
yeah .
fuckin &apos; terrible nightmares .
yeah , it knocked the edge right the hell off your appetite .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
no , it is some scary shit .
not my problem much longer .
speaking of scary shit , was that you in the bathroom ?
oh , yeah . i thought they already dropped the biological weapon .
all right , i gotta go .
i thought we were gonna go hunting .
you hear the turkeys this morning ?
no , i gotta take off .
uncle pat . take care of yourself .
be careful of the alligators down there . - all right , tough guy .
hey , tone ! what &apos;d you do , knock over a roadside stand ?
my uncle &apos;s farm . less than 100 miles from here .
it &apos;s like a whole different world .
the bullshit really falls away up there .
hear about that shit with the ports ?
customs agents are bad for us , but antiterrorism @-@ wise , they &apos;re doing nothing .
what &apos;s it gonna take , a fuckin &apos; nuclear bomb ?
