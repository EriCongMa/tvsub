第三季 第八集
&lt; i &gt; the new neighbor ... &lt; / i &gt;
he &apos;s cute .
he &apos;s a bachelor .
&lt; i &gt; ... became a hero ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... in a crisis that brought julie and austin together , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; while carlos and gabby broke apart . &lt; / i &gt;
i had a career and a future ,
but i gave it all up for you .
and what did i get in return ?
&lt; i &gt; the police assembled their pieces of evidence . &lt; / i &gt;
your number was written on her hand .
i can &apos;t help you .
no memory , huh ? that &apos;s convenient .
&lt; i &gt; karen mccluskey had always believed in helping others , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; whether they wanted her help or not . &lt; / i &gt;
what &apos;s all this ?
you know how you never got around
to painting your garage door ? well , it &apos;s done .
hope you like blue .
baxter . you found him .
yeah , and i got him neutered , too .
i figured you wouldn &apos;t want any more strays around here .
karen .
hi , alberta .
i took these down for you since ,
you know , christmas was six months ago .
&lt; i &gt; yes , mrs. mccluskey &apos;s helping hand &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; was known throughout wisteria lane . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but on this day it was about to get slapped . &lt; / i &gt;
what the hell are you doing ?
jeez , edie , you scared me .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
getting mike &apos;s house ready .
he comes back from the hospital tomorrow .
since when do you have a key to his garage ?
he gave me one , in case of an emergency .
don &apos;t lie to me , prune .
fine . i found it under his mat .
i &apos;m not doing anything wrong .
i come over once a week
and start his mower so the engine doesn &apos;t get rusty .
and do you mow your lawn with it , too ?
what &apos;s the big deal ? i &apos;m doing him a favor .
well , he doesn &apos;t need any favors from you .
i &apos;m gonna go through mike &apos;s house room by room ,
and if i find one paper clip missing ,
i &apos;m calling the cops .
funny you should talk about stuff that &apos;s missing .
i found those pictures of mike and susan you threw out .
pictures ?
oh , don &apos;t act for me .
i know mike &apos;s been having troubles with his memory .
my guess , you don &apos;t want him to remember
how crazy he was about his old girlfriend .
i don &apos;t need to resort to deception to land a man .
oh , edie ? i saved the pictures .
and i can show them to mike any time i like .
&lt; i &gt; yes , karen mccluskey believed in helping others . &lt; / i &gt;
where are you going with this ?
&lt; i &gt; which she felt gave her the right ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... to help herself . &lt; / i &gt;
remember to be polite . smile .
&lt; i &gt; each year , as part of their fundraising drive , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the fairview adventure scouts &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; would award a shiny new bike &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; to whoever sold the most magazine subscriptions . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and each scout would set out , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; utterly convinced the prize would be hers . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that &apos;s the beauty of youth . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; little girls believe anything is possible . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that is , until they grow up and get divorced . &lt; / i &gt;
hi .
what if i told you there is a way you could help children
while also reading your favorite magazines
at a reduced price ?
would you like to hear more ?
sure . knock yourself out .
wise choice .
for the lady of the house we offer redbook , glamour ,
vog @-@ you .
i think you mean vogue , sweetie .
you sure ?
i should know . i was on the cover .
no way .
uh , way .
see the coat i &apos;m wearing in this shot ?
that &apos;s genuine ocelot fur .
although the photographer was the real animal ,
if you know what i &apos;m saying .
which i hope you don &apos;t .
and don &apos;t ever do drugs , ok ?
being a model must be so amazing .
why did you stop ?
well , i fell in love , got married
and moved to the suburbs
for the whole fairy tale , happy ending thing .
that was a crock .
so , you going back to modeling ?
no . no , no , no , no , no .
why not ? what else are you gonna do ?
you &apos;re going back to modeling ? this is so sudden .
let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves . i &apos;m gonna fly to new york ,
meet with my old agent , and take it from there .
come on , you guys .
this is exciting . be happy for me .
oh , we are .
we &apos;re just gonna miss you , that &apos;s all .
now that my divorce is final ,
i need a reason to wake up in the morning .
i have this hole in my life that can &apos;t be filled by shopping .
that &apos;s right . i said it .
oh , my gosh , lynette .
i &apos;ll get the kids . they &apos;re dying to see you .
ok .
oh , my gosh . you didn &apos;t have to do this !
hi .
you look great .
apparently taking a.38 slug to the shoulder agrees with you .
yeah . um , listen , about that ,
the kids don &apos;t know what happened .
they don &apos;t ?
they &apos;re a little young to deal with
their mother getting shot .
all i told them kayla is staying with her grandmother
and i made up a story about how i got hurt .
hey , mom !
here they are .
hello . oh , this side .
i can &apos;t believe you got in a fight with a hobo .
yeah . let &apos;s see how well you do on a morphine drip .
mommy , come inside .
we helped mrs. mccluskey make your favorite lunch .
fantastic . lead the way . i &apos;m coming in .
hurry up . i &apos;m hungry .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
there she is . hi , bunny , bunny .
hey . why don &apos;t you go inside and get the party started ?
i &apos;ve gotta ...
hi , bunny . i &apos;ll be right there .
lynette , you &apos;re home .
yeah .
how are you doing ?
i &apos;m good . i just ...
how do i thank the man who saved my life ?
you don &apos;t have to say anything .
i &apos;m gonna make you a cake .
a cake ?
yeah .
i never make cakes . this is huge .
in that case , thanks .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna make you a cake !
christmas carols ? it &apos;s not even thanksgiving .
i &apos;m starting my cards early this year .
it puts me in the mood to spread holiday cheer .
and with this pack of lies in this family newsletter ,
she spreads holiday denial .
andrew , it &apos;s etiquette .
nobody wants the truth at christmas .
well said , darling .
would you put on another cd ?
something with sleigh bells .
oh , by the way , orson ,
i need your mother &apos;s address at the nursing home .
oh . well , i appreciate the thought ,
but you needn &apos;t send her a card .
don &apos;t be silly .
i &apos;m sending one to the man who reads our gas meter .
i can send one to your mother .
she &apos;s completely senile .
she &apos;ll only try to dunk it in her coffee .
all the more reason to send one .
let the nurses know that
she has family at home who loves her ,
and who could drop by at any minute
and slap them with a lawsuit .
bree , i hear what you &apos;re saying .
orson , what &apos;s the big deal ?
it &apos;s just an address .
fine . i &apos;ll get my book .
the home is somewhere over in lakeview .
lakeview ?
you gave me the impression that she was back east .
that &apos;s because i wanted to avoid this conversation .
if she &apos;s only 30 minutes away ,
why haven &apos;t you been visiting her ?
ok , the truth is , it breaks my heart to see her now .
i want to remember her as she was .
but , orson ...
bree !
i refuse to sit in a room
that smells of disinfectant and lime jell @-@ o
making small talk with a woman who doesn &apos;t remember me .
now let it go , damn it .
but , by all means , do send a card .
the elves will tickle her .
well , shall we ?
wait .
julie &apos;s gonna know we came home early to check up on her .
i don &apos;t want her to think i &apos;m overprotective and clingy .
the girl was held hostage .
it &apos;s natural you &apos;re gonna be clingy .
yeah , it &apos;s been a week .
i &apos;m getting on her nerves .
how about this ?
we came home early because we hated the restaurant .
the service was dreadful . the lobster was inedible .
ok .
wait . if we hated the restaurant ,
then why are we bringing home food ?
good point .
no , no , wait , wait ! are you kidding ?
that &apos;s lobster . ok .
i thought the restaurant was fantastic .
you were the fussy snob who was impossible to please .
why do i have to be the fussy snob ?
because you &apos;re british .
fine .
i trust you &apos;ll make it up to me later
by doing the things a gentleman expects
when he &apos;s sprung for lobster .
i &apos;m not getting any tonight , am i ?
you &apos;re supposed to be having dinner .
it &apos;s my fault .
i found the restaurant to be ...
oh , let it go .
we came home because i was worried about you .
and with good reason !
you put on your shirt and get out !
but i didn &apos;t bring a shirt .
see , i was out running ...
who cares ? go !
how could you treat him like that ?
if austin hadn &apos;t been in that supermarket ,
i might not be here .
yes , i am grateful ,
but i found a way to say thank you
without taking my top off .
a couple buttons came undone .
not like my boobs were out .
ok . well , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s getting late .
and i really ...
no , ian , am i overreacting here ?
well , i can understand on the heels of a crisis ,
two people might bond and find themselves ...
you &apos;re a very naughty girl !
julie .
that boy drinks , he steals ,
and now i find him mauling you on my couch .
that &apos;s it . i forbid you to see him .
you can &apos;t do that .
i choose who i date .
yeah ? well , i choose to ground you .
two weeks , baby .
i &apos;ll see him at school .
well , you won &apos;t go to school .
i &apos;ll homeschool you .
you &apos;re gonna teach me trig ?
you can &apos;t balance your checkbook .
yes , you &apos;ll be poorly educated .
you won &apos;t get into college ,
and you &apos;ll work for minimum wage for the rest of your life .
all because of that boy !
i hope you &apos;re happy !
mom , i like this guy .
i &apos;m sorry if it makes you unhappy ,
but i &apos;m going to keep seeing him .
doesn &apos;t the place look great ?
i came in and straightened up .
i wanted everything to look nice for you .
are you ok ?
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s just that ...
i &apos;m home , but it doesn &apos;t really feel like home .
it will . give it time .
the important thing is that you &apos;re back from the hospital .
and every day you &apos;re getting better .
hey , the worst &apos;s behind you .
i need the delfino search warrant .
you &apos;re not gonna get it without probable cause .
guy &apos;s phone number was written on a dead girl &apos;s hand .
the judge is gonna need more .
thought you might say that .
here &apos;s monique poulier &apos;s lab work .
the infrared spectroscopy matched
paint fragments in the head wound
to the proximal line of pipe wrenches .
they &apos;re high @-@ end ,
only used by professional plumbers .
and guess what our boy delfino does for a living ?
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
what do you mean you can &apos;t shoot her , francesco ?
if you can airbrush her acne ,
you can airbrush the track marks .
now , don &apos;t call me again unless she od &apos;s .
gabrielle , ma petite fille .
sit .
you look amazing . younger than ever .
it &apos;s my new derma filler .
it &apos;s banned here ,
so my assistant smuggles it in from brazil .
isn &apos;t it fun ? i have my own drug mule .
that &apos;s great .
well , i have some fun news of my own .
i &apos;m ready to model again .
really ? oh .
the last time we spoke
you couldn &apos;t wait to quit .
you were giving it all up for love .
what happened to prince charming ?
divorce .
oh , single again .
isn &apos;t that ironic ,
since i &apos;m the one you called ...
oh , how did you put it ?
a career @-@ obsessed lesbo who would die alone
and be eaten by her cats .
did i say that ?
water under the bridge .
i thought it was funny .
it &apos;s even funnier now .
look , marcella , i &apos;m back .
and we made such a great team before .
i think we can be again .
i don &apos;t know . darling , things are different now .
you &apos;re not gonna be able to jump back in
where you left off .
well , i just want to work .
well , i &apos;m still not sure .
you know what might help ?
if you groveled .
are you serious ?
i can &apos;t tell ,
because your face doesn &apos;t move anymore .
no , i &apos;m joking .
welcome back , darling .
thank you .
well , hello , there .
how pretty you look today .
it &apos;s wonderful that you &apos;re up and about .
you must be enjoying these colorful balloons .
why are you talking to me like i &apos;m a moron ?
oh ! oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
the nurse pointed me over here .
i &apos;m looking for gloria hodge .
i &apos;m gloria hodge .
who might you be ?
i must say , i &apos;m surprised at
how lucid you are .
orson led me to believe ...
that i was in the final stages of dementia . no .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s just wishful thinking on his part .
well , how can he feel that way ?
you &apos;re his mother .
i wouldn &apos;t judge him too harshly . ours is a ...
complicated relationship .
there is love , to be sure ,
but we have a way of disappointing each other .
well , how does he disappoint you ?
he &apos;s cold , rigid ,
and ... and utterly incapable of letting go of the past .
and how do you disappoint him ?
i refuse to die .
yes , i see .
well , surely this rift isn &apos;t irreparable .
do you know how people
in nursing homes spend their days , bree ?
they think about the past .
and all the things they &apos;d do differently
if they had the chance .
please tell orson that i &apos;m sorry .
and in spite of everything , i still love him .
well , i have a better idea .
why don &apos;t you tell him yourself ?
that would be great .
i really appreciate it .
ok . thank you .
so , what did ed say ?
when do you go back to work ?
he said take as much time as i want with pay .
you should get gunned down more often .
hey , there they are .
hey , guys .
hello .
how was school ? doing well ?
mommy , were you shot ?
shot ? where did you hear that ?
jordan blackwelder .
that &apos;s the same creep who tried to ruin santa claus .
and he said the same crazy lady that shot you ,
killed auntie nora dead .
it was on the news and everything .
listen , kids . i am sorry .
we shouldn &apos;t have lied .
but sometimes parents want to
protect kids from scary things .
and , look , the good news is ,
mommy &apos;s fine now .
and we &apos;ll all see auntie nora again in heaven .
or wherever .
did they let you keep the bullet ?
no . i &apos;m afraid not .
that blows .
we wanted to bring it for show and tell .
hey , sweetheart , you ok ?
what if the crazy lady comes back ?
she won &apos;t .
how do you know ?
well , because she &apos;s up in heaven with auntie nora .
or wherever .
julie mayer , you get back here !
you &apos;re grounded , remember ?
edie britt , i want to talk to you .
i just survived a hostage situation .
haven &apos;t i suffered enough for one week ?
you keep your nephew away from my daughter or else .
look , i don &apos;t like it , either .
but the harder we try to keep them apart
the more they &apos;ll fight to be together .
just let it run its course .
are you crazy ?
if we don &apos;t do something those two
could end up having sex !
could ?
oh , my god . you don &apos;t ...
let me put it this way .
i &apos;ve got a box of condoms in my dresser .
eleven are gone .
i can only account for eight of them .
how can you be so calm about this ?
edie ?
yeah .
can you help me with this tie ?
mike .
you &apos;re out of the hospital .
yeah . he &apos;s home .
in fact , we &apos;re gonna go out and celebrate tonight .
i &apos;ll be with you in one sec , ok , babe ?
since you asked ,
i &apos;m calm because i know if two people
are meant to be together ,
there &apos;s nothing anyone can do about it .
ok . i should be back at around 6 : 00 .
they can have one snack .
try and push apples .
but if they threaten violence ,
i have an emergency candy bar
under the sink .
not anymore , you don &apos;t .
oh , jeez .
mommy , where are you going ?
to the market .
no .
hey , sweetie , it &apos;s a different market .
you &apos;re gonna get shot again .
no , i won &apos;t .
lots of mommies go to the store every day
and they &apos;re fine .
it &apos;s really not a scary place .
you went to the store and got shot .
and auntie nora died .
i &apos;m only gonna be in there ten minutes . i promise .
can &apos;t she go ?
fine , i &apos;ll go .
thanks .
you don &apos;t give a hoot if i get shot , do you , kid ?
you must be tanya . i &apos;m gabrielle .
we &apos;re gonna be co @-@ models today .
now , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever done
one of these big shoots before ,
but don &apos;t be nervous . dirkin and i are old friends .
he &apos;s a sweetheart . now , just remember , he &apos;s the king .
do exactly what he says and you &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ve been modeling for two years .
i &apos;ve done six magazine covers ,
and i &apos;m sleeping with dirkin .
i guess you &apos;re all set , then .
you &apos;ve got some wardrobe choices .
i want to be buried in this dress .
this is for tanya . the mom &apos;s stuff is at the end .
mom ?
ok , love , let &apos;s get the blood pumping !
the concept is &quot; lock up your daughters . &quot;
ok , get to work , everybody .
tanya , i want you to hover down here on the lawn ,
looking absolutely delicious .
thank you very much .
and up here on the porch ,
mom and dad looking all scandalized .
excuse me , dirkin ?
yes , love ?
it &apos;s gabby .
gabrielle marquez .
you shot me in milan , remember ?
yes . yes ! lovely to see you again .
did you have a question , then ?
i do . um ...
aren &apos;t you a little worried that i &apos;m gonna pull focus ?
i mean , it &apos;s a little confusing .
people are gonna see tanya ,
then they &apos;re gonna see that guy .
and they &apos;re gonna wonder who i am .
you &apos;re the mom .
people aren &apos;t gonna buy that . here &apos;s what i was thinking .
i slap on one of those gowns .
i play tanya &apos;s big sister ,
home from college to raise a little hell .
and we &apos;re gonna cram all that on a subtitle , are we ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just this outfit is hideous .
just make it work .
fine . i just need a moment to get into character .
gabrielle , what &apos;s the hold up ?
we &apos;ve got to get moving here .
ready , ready .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , i made it work .
i &apos;m hot mom .
get me her agent .
before we begin , would either of you like some cookies ,
milk , lemonade ?
mom , why are we here ?
ah . cutting to the chase . i like it .
i have a confession to make .
this whole dating drama has been keeping me up at night .
and i hate being the bitchy , naggy mom .
when it comes to parenting ,
i am much more comfortable playing the good cop .
you see where i &apos;m going with this , kids ?
no .
oh . well , in that case ...
... meet the bad cop .
daddy .
hi , baby girl .
is that the guy ?
yep .
get him .
this is so unfair .
look , you defied my wishes ,
you broke my rules .
did you think i was just gonna throw in the towel ?
face it . i outsmarted you .
who &apos;s ian ?
what ?
you &apos;re dating some british guy named ian .
how did that come up ?
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t realize it was a big secret .
when you said it was true love with you and the plumber ,
i was a good guy . i stepped aside .
and now you &apos;re on to someone else .
big picture , carl .
his hand up our daughter &apos;s shirt .
don &apos;t change the subject .
that is the subject .
how serious is it with this ian guy ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s complicated .
yeah , he &apos;s kind of married .
he &apos;s what ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
in her defense , his wife is in a coma .
all right , that &apos;s it , all right !
i forbid you to see this guy .
what ? no . i don &apos;t take orders from you .
mom has a point , dad .
you can &apos;t tell a woman who she can and can &apos;t date .
it &apos;s her choice .
exactly.thank you . wait , no .
that does not apply to you .
you know , if you don &apos;t care about my feelings ,
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing here .
your feelings ? my god .
you are the worst bad cop ever .
go to your room .
not you .
get back , you &apos;re under arrest .
no , i &apos;m not . aah !
you &apos;ve been reading comic books for awhile .
don &apos;t you want to go and play ?
no . i want to stay with you .
yeah ?
ok .
hey , art .
oh , hey . how are you ?
good
um , listen , as if saving my life wasn &apos;t enough ,
i have a little favor to ask .
sure . what &apos;s up ?
my kids are having a hard time .
they &apos;re freaked out by that whole supermarket thing .
you &apos;re my hostage .
keep moving or i &apos;ll blow your face off .
ok , it &apos;s my turn . give me the gun .
not so much them .
right .
but my other son , parker .
so ... back to the favor .
hey , parker .
i want you to meet our new neighbor art .
he lives in the house across the street .
his sister has the cool wheelchair with the joystick .
hey , there , parker .
in the daytime art coaches swimming at the rec center .
but ... please , can i tell parker ?
please ?
and compromise my secret identity ?
no way , mrs. scavo . no way .
secret identity ?
oh , great .
now the cat &apos;s out of the bag . we might as well tell him .
it &apos;s ok . you can trust him , really .
art is the one who saved me at the supermarket .
he &apos;s sort of a superhero .
give me a break .
it &apos;s true .
all right . if you &apos;re a superhero ,
what &apos;s your name ?
i &apos;m ... protector man .
because i protect people from bad guys .
you don &apos;t believe me , do you ?
ok .
i really shouldn &apos;t do this , but ...
wow . did you really save my mom ?
i really did .
he really did .
that &apos;s why you don &apos;t have to worry .
that &apos;s protector man &apos;s job .
your job is to run and play and have fun .
ok ?
ok .
ok .
oh . my cousin went to purdue .
what the hell ?
delfino .
nice to see you up and about .
here &apos;s our search warrant .
search warrant ? let me see that .
how are we doing ?
we couldn &apos;t find the toolbox .
the man &apos;s a plumber . keep looking .
sir , i can &apos;t find the thing .
you tired ...
you come with me .
marcella !
i don &apos;t know what they told you ,
but all i &apos;m asking for is a simple costume change .
you don &apos;t get to pull diva crap .
tanya gets away with it because she &apos;s a star .
you are nothing .
where do you get off talking to me like that ?
i shot 36 covers by the time i was 20 .
well , you &apos;re 30 now .
when you make that face you look 35 .
do you know how many photographers
would die to work with me again ?
yeah . zero .
i had to call in major favors just to get you this job .
i don &apos;t believe that .
know what i don &apos;t believe ?
you gave up a brilliant career to play house in the suburbs .
the minute it falls apart you come back
expecting a homecoming parade .
well , guess what , sweetie ? we &apos;ve moved on .
now , get your polyester ass over there
and act like the pro you used to be .
beautiful , tanya . that &apos;s it , chin up .
fantastic . mother , hold the plate higher .
beautiful , tanya . oh , you are gorgeous !
yes , girl . lovely , lovely !
hi , mike . welcome home . you remember me ?
yeah , i think so .
the corner house with all the gnomes out front ?
you &apos;re thinking of martha huber . terrible story .
someone beat her to death and then buried her in the forest .
ironic , huh ? isn &apos;t that where gnomes live ?
i don &apos;t really know that much about gnomes .
anyway , i know the cops were here earlier .
so ?
well , you won &apos;t remember this , but one night , two years ago ,
you drove me to the hospital after i had an attack of angina .
probably saved my life .
anyway , i figure i owe you . here .
you might want to wash that wrench off .
it &apos;s got something on it .
sorry i &apos;m late . mrs. prescott broke a crown ...
orson , how well you look .
hello , mother .
a word , darling .
i can &apos;t believe you did this !
and i can &apos;t believe you told me that she was senile !
you lied to me .
yes , to spare us the misery of her company .
you don &apos;t know her , bree . she &apos;s a loathsome woman .
i refuse to break bread with her .
now you listen to me .
that woman gave you life .
the fifth commandment tells us to honor our parents ,
no matter how hideous or repellent they may be .
that &apos;s not exactly ...
orson , it &apos;s implied !
now , get out there and show her some respect .
fine , but if you expect anything
more from me than forced civility ,
you will be deeply disappointed .
bree , the salmon is superb .
well , thank you .
it did win me the blue ribbon
at the gourmet county cook @-@ off .
i just love the sauce . what gives it that kick ?
you &apos;d never ask a magician how a trick is done .
you &apos;ve barely touched your salmon , dear .
is everything ok ?
yes .
i was just wondering why you &apos;re here .
i want us to be friends .
ok .
let &apos;s suppose i just had a massive head injury
and believe you .
we &apos;re pals . what do you want ?
orson . why does she have to have an ulterior motive ?
i want out of that home .
ah , there it is .
it &apos;s a hellhole . besides , i &apos;m perfectly healthy now .
my hip is better . i can handle the stairs .
and you said when i got strong enough
i &apos;d get to go back to my house .
oh , here &apos;s the thing .
i sold it .
what ?
you heard me .
what about my things ?
all gone . i also sold the car .
that &apos;s the thing about hellholes .
they don &apos;t pay for themselves .
how dare you ! you had no right !
ok . maybe i will share my secret ingredient .
i should have smothered you in your crib
when i had the chance .
paprika ! there , it &apos;s out .
that &apos;s the mother i remember .
i was wondering when she &apos;d show up .
yes , orson , i am your mother .
so you more than anyone should know
how i deal with betrayal .
so ... can we call her grandma ?
i &apos;ve got one more load , then i &apos;m gonna do my homework .
you have anything you want me to throw in ?
no , i &apos;m good , thanks .
mom , listen ...
i know i &apos;ve put you through the wringer lately , and i &apos;m sorry .
sixteen years of being perfect . you were due .
that &apos;s what i don &apos;t get .
you &apos;ve always trusted my judgment .
why can &apos;t you trust me about austin ?
relationships have nothing to do with good judgment .
it doesn &apos;t matter how smart you are .
you can still get hurt .
you do your homework . i &apos;m gonna finish the laundry .
ok .
there you go , mrs. h.
all right .
can i use your bathroom ?
come on in .
thank you .
please stay for dessert .
i &apos;ll work on orson and we &apos;ll discuss this together .
you saw what he sentenced me to .
a room no better than a furnished coffin .
i have nothing to say to him .
well , then talk to me .
i know you &apos;re upset , but don &apos;t shut me out , please .
please , gloria , let me in .
well , i didn &apos;t mean it literally , but ok .
we &apos;ii , um , sit together and we &apos;ll talk .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not going back to that place !
gloria , stop !
let &apos;s get my mother back to the home , shall we ?
yeah , not that it &apos;s any of my business ,
but is everything ok with you folks ?
oh , yeah . there was a little tension earlier ,
but it &apos;s all been resolved .
what the hell ?
no . i absolutely forbid it .
just for a few weeks till we find a place
where she &apos;ll be happier .
you should have heard her in the car .
she &apos;s miserable in that nursing home .
i don &apos;t care . my mother &apos;s not moving in here
till she fits in a jar on the mantle .
how can you be so cold ?
you don &apos;t know who she is .
i &apos;ve worked my entire life to get away from that woman .
why ? what could she have possibly done
to make you hate her so much ?
look , there is nothing to be gained by dredging up the past .
orson , if there &apos;s something i should know ...
could i speak to my son a moment ?
of course .
so you know ,
i &apos;ve decided to accept your wife &apos;s kind invitation .
i won &apos;t allow it .
oh , i think you will .
we &apos;re going to end our quarrel right now .
or i &apos;ll tell your wife what it &apos;s about .
you wouldn &apos;t .
just try me .
i gave you life .
you know i won &apos;t hesitate to take it away .
now , give mother a kiss .
why in the hell would i want to do that ?
to make it look real .
hey ! you &apos;re back !
i &apos;d give you a hug , but i &apos;m sweaty .
how was new york ?
it was fine .
bree said you got a job on the first day . you &apos;re such a star .
i want details .
oh ! you know , just hours and hours of
sitting around looking pretty .
but i think i &apos;m done with modeling .
so you &apos;re not gonna move to new york ?
well , if something great comes up , i might fly out ,
but i &apos;m pretty settled here .
oh , thank god . we were all so worried we were losing you .
ok . now i &apos;m hugging you .
oh ! it &apos;s amazing . your life is such an adventure .
i can &apos;t wait to see what you do next .
yeah . me , too .
ok .
mr. protector man ?
that &apos;s a secret .
hello ?
hello ?
ah , sweet .
mom , look .
hey , don &apos;t touch anything . i &apos;m just gonna write a note .
then we &apos;ll go . ok .
parker ?
hey , come back here .
honey ? come on , we &apos;re leaving .
parker !
parker , come on , we &apos;re leaving .
why didn &apos;t you come when i called ?
superhero houses are great !
parker , come on . we &apos;re gonna get out of here .
why ?
i just said so . come on .
&lt; i &gt; there are so many things we wish we could tell the young . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; we &apos;d like to persuade them not to grow up so fast . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but they won &apos;t listen . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; we want to tell them that beauty fades . &lt; / i &gt;
the look . let &apos;s see the look , darling .
&lt; i &gt; but they refuse to believe it . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; we warn them that their actions will have consequences . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but still , they defy us . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; sadly , the young can &apos;t begin to understand &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the world is a dangerous place . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; so it &apos;s up to us to do anything we can to protect them . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; absolutely anything . &lt; / i &gt;
