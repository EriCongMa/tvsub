hey , kid .
nice to see you , too .
the storm !
it &apos;s okay . we can fix it . i &apos;ll talk to marco .
do you think it &apos;s still here ?
what are you looking for ?
my book .
why &apos;d you bury it here ?
so my mom doesn &apos;t find it .
hiding it under your mattress wasn &apos;t good enough ?
that &apos;s the first place the evil queen would look .
how about leaving it with me ?
that &apos;s the second place .
it &apos;s still here . good .
so your mom doesn &apos;t know about the castle ?
no . this is our secret .
henry ?
henry .
i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
you know you have a session with archie this morning .
i should &apos;ve known he was with you .
henry , car . now .
you let him play here ?
the storm hit it hard , but we can fix it .
well , can you fix a cracked cranium ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s what you &apos;ll have on your hands
if one of these boards collapses under his weight .
you &apos;re not thinking about henry or his safety ,
just ways around me .
ms. swan , don &apos;t let your feelings cloud your judgment .
people can get hurt .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you &apos;re the sheriff now .
it &apos;s time to be responsible .
don &apos;t let my feelings cloud my judgment ?
that &apos;s all regina ever does .
she &apos;s just upset because
you and henry have a special place and she ...
she doesn &apos;t .
how &apos;d she find out about the castle in the first place ?
she knows everything about this town . she &apos;s the mayor .
everything okay ?
yeah , i just need to go .
look , if it makes you feel any better ,
i think you &apos;re right .
i see the effect she has on henry .
i wish everyone else did , too .
i can grant your wish .
oh , sidney .
you want a side of bacon with that whiskey ?
you want to show this town who the mayor really is ?
i can help .
it &apos;s gonna be kinda hard to do from inside her pocket .
the mayor and i are done .
sure you are .
she got me fired from the paper .
she made a fool of me in the election .
so i started working on an expose on the mayor &apos;s office ,
and i found something she didn &apos;t want found .
sidney , you &apos;re drunk .
go home . sleep it off .
be grateful you don &apos;t have to answer to her anymore .
call me .
storybrooke deserves to know the truth about her .
here we go .
you awakened the genie of agrabah .
you &apos;re entitled to three wishes--no more , no less .
but you must know that magic has its limits .
you cannot wish for life nor death .
you cannot wish for love . you cannot wish for more wishes .
and once spoken ,
a wish cannot be undone , no matter what the consequences .
so ... tell me your first wish .
i cannot think of a single thing i desire .
i have everything i need .
i seek nothing more than the happiness
of all who set foot in my kingdom .
you are in my kingdom ,
and yet you seem unhappy .
i have served as genie of the lamp
for longer than you &apos;ve been alive .
life as a genie is not as magical as it may appear .
so you wish to be free ?
more than anything .
then i know my first wish .
i wish you to be free .
can it be ?
am i truly free ?
you &apos;re the genie . you tell me .
there are two more wishes left in the lamp .
what will you do with them ?
for my second wish ...
i wish to give my third and final wish to you .
in my time , i have granted 1,001 wishes ,
and i have seen them end poorly 1,001 times .
making a wish comes with a price ,
and that is why i will never ...
use ... this wish .
you are a man of wisdom , genie .
now tell me--
what will you do with your freedom ?
find the one thing i &apos;ve always desired ,
that my prison has kept from me ...
true love .
then you must come join me at my palace .
i am certain you will find it there .
come . meet my family .
your palace is as lovely as you are kind .
oh , it &apos;s more than kindness , my friend .
this is my beautiful daughter snow .
how do you do ?
and regina , my wife , the queen .
hello .
hey . what happened ? i came as soon as i could .
the castle--she &apos;s tearing the whole thing down !
my book ! i @-@ it &apos;s gone !
congratulations , madame mayor .
you destroyed the thing he loves .
a dangerous thing
that can only hurt henry and others .
you see me as a villain , ms. swan .
but that &apos;s just your perception , and you &apos;re wrong .
learn your place in this town ,
or soon enough , you won &apos;t be in it .
sidney , hi .
i &apos;m in .
i want everyone to know who she really is .
i got your text . what &apos;s going on ?
follow me .
david , you &apos;re scaring me . what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s wrong is you &apos;re late ,
and the wine &apos;s getting warm .
we have to stop doing this .
we just started doing it .
we have to figure out what we &apos;re doing .
we will .
tomorrow .
okay . tomorrow .
all right , i &apos;m listening .
so what do you know about her ?
$ 50,000 .
i &apos;m sorry ?
50 grand out of the budget is missing ,
and regina is responsible .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s what you have on her ?
the money is just the tip of the iceberg .
we figure out what she &apos;s doing , it all falls apart ,
it all crumbles , and we &apos;ll finally learn her secrets .
you see what she is .
i see it .
all we need is a crack in the mirror to show everyone .
i &apos;m telling you , this is it .
all right . what &apos;s your plan ?
tap her phone . g.p.s. her car .
hack into her e @-@ mail .
dip into your bail bonds person bag of tricks .
no . i &apos;m sheriff now .
i have to be responsible .
i want to do this by the book .
she &apos;s gonna know that you &apos;re on to her
sooner than later .
are you prepared for her wrath ?
oh , yeah .
good . because i wasn &apos;t .
if you thought she was so terrifying ...
how did you allow yourself to end up in her pocket ?
i used to think she was a different person .
happy birthday , your majesty .
no gifts are required to mark this special day ,
for they all pale
in comparison to the greatest gift of all--
my daughter snow .
father .
father . you make me blush .
every day i look upon your face ,
and i am reminded of your dearly departed mother ...
who , like you ,
truly was ...
the fairest in all the land .
not in a festive mood ?
no one seems to notice my absence .
i noticed .
such a lovely tree .
yes , it &apos;s from my childhood garden .
the tree and i share something in common .
neither of us can leave the palace
and neither of us truly belongs .
no matter how hard i try to please the king ,
he will never love me the way he loved his first wife .
i &apos;m trapped by the memory of the life they used to share .
i know about being trapped ,
more than anyone .
maybe this will lift your spirits .
so you ...
can see yourself
the way i see you .
and how do you see me ?
as the fairest in all the land .
记录大厅
when did that transfer go through ?
does three weeks ago sound right ?
yeah . why ?
because those records are missing .
emma , there &apos;s something i &apos;d like to talk to--
hi , sidney .
hey . we &apos;re just doing some work .
i think we may have found something on regina .
interesting work .
oh , i approve .
you wanna go by the book ? let &apos;s get a warrant .
what judge are we gonna find that she doesn &apos;t own ?
we &apos;re screwed .
or ... there &apos;s my way .
i want to do this right , sidney .
and what &apos;s right is exposing her .
sometimes doing a bad thing for a good reason is okay , right ?
yeah . i mean , maybe you &apos;re doing something wrong ,
but if it &apos;s what &apos;s meant to be , if it &apos;s what &apos;s right ,
does that really make you a bad person ?
exactly .
wow . you two are doing a whole lot of rationalizing .
but look what she &apos;s done to you , to me ,
to your son , and it &apos;s not gonna stop ,
so whatever you do , you gotta do something .
okay .
let &apos;s start by talking to her .
and just what are you and the ...
disgraced ex @-@ reporter accusing me of ?
$ 50,000 was transferred out of the city account by you .
well , as mayor , i &apos;m involved in many transactions .
check the public records if you have questions .
that &apos;s the thing . they &apos;re missing from three weeks ago .
you have any idea what happened to them ?
well , if they &apos;re missing , i probably checked them out ,
as my job often requires me to do .
and if they were checked out three weeks ago ,
well , that means they burned ...
in a fire .
in a fire , that if i recall , got you elected sheriff .
i have nothing to hide .
okay .
there &apos;s nothing for us to do . let &apos;s go , sidney .
emma .
no , she &apos;s right . we have nothing .
that was your plan ? i thought you were gonna do something .
i did . i planted a bug .
you win , sidney . let &apos;s do whatever it takes .
you called for me , your majesty ?
i have reason to believe ...
my wife &apos;s heart belongs to another man .
well , certainly , the queen would never stray , your majesty .
and yet her diary suggests otherwise .
last night , a man gave me a gift ,
and though it was but a simple mirror ,
it awakened feelings in me that i abandoned long ago .
hope for love and companionship ,
even though i am trapped in my husband &apos;s court .
sadly , the diary does not name
the man who gave her this mirror .
i am not a fool .
i realize that the queen is unhappy
and yearns for someone to love her in a way that i never can .
and yet i never imagined that she would betray me like this .
well , certainly ,
the queen would never act on these feelings .
love makes people do foolish things .
and why have you called upon me , your majesty ?
i need someone with your wits
to learn the identity of the man who has stolen my wife &apos;s heart .
and what will you do to him once i have found him ?
that is my concern , not yours .
now ...
tell me , genie ,
can you find the man who gave the queen this mirror
or not ?
ms. ginger , i really don &apos;t have time
for more complaints about working conditions .
the air temperature is not one of my areas .
scintillating .
find anything good yet ?
yeah , better than good .
she made this call a little over an hour ago .
i &apos;ll meet you tonight at access road 23
with the rest of your payment .
yes , it will all be in cash .
a @-@ and i don &apos;t need to remind you
that no one can know about this .
yes , i know it has to be tonight .
who &apos;s on the other end ?
you bugged the office , not the phone .
well , we &apos;re just gonna have to find out .
yeah .
a payoff in the woods . that &apos;s promising .
a payoff using stolen city funds .
let &apos;s go find out who she &apos;s meeting .
emma .
it won &apos;t stop .
oh . you okay ?
yeah . you ?
yeah .
we &apos;re gonna miss that handoff .
emma .
what ?
you know that bug you planted ?
i think regina found it .
someone &apos;s been tampering with the brakes .
she &apos;s on to us .
wait !
the bitch tried to have me killed .
i &apos;m finding her .
let &apos;s be cautious . we need to think clearly .
to hell with caution . i &apos;m gonna find out what she &apos;s doing
and why she &apos;s out here .
she was meeting me .
what are you doing out here with her ?
just a little business transaction .
what &apos;s in the briefcase ?
everything comes at a price .
land is no different .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re meeting her out here ?
regina bought your land ?
the very ground you &apos;re standing on .
what does she want it for ?
you know , in business , i find it &apos;s best not to ask too many questions .
hurts the bottom line .
the question is , emma ,
why are you standing out here in the middle of the night
with mr . glass ?
you don &apos;t know what regina did to me .
you don &apos;t know what she did to her son .
we can &apos;t just sit idly by .
of course you can .
be careful .
emotional entanglements can lead us down very dangerous paths .
i was beginning to worry you wouldn &apos;t come .
you were expecting the queen ?
who are you ?
what have you done with her ?
the king has locked her away in her chambers .
my daughter is a prisoner in her own kingdom .
you ... are the queen &apos;s father ?
please , take this to her .
the palace guards won &apos;t allow me into her chambers .
they know i &apos;d die for her .
but you ...
the king trusts you .
he doesn &apos;t know that you have my daughter &apos;s heart .
the guards will allow you in .
give her this box .
wait . i don &apos;t understand . what is in it ?
this is the only thing that can free her
from this wretched life .
if you truly care for my daughter ,
i know you &apos;ll do whatever it takes
to set her free .
what are we doing here ?
we know she bought land from gold .
we don &apos;t know why .
i &apos;m willing to bet it &apos;s for personal reasons .
but we have to know for sure . we need documents
that officially link her to that land .
so you want to break into her office ? it &apos;s locked ,
and she &apos;s got a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art security system and alarm .
if we don &apos;t show this town who regina really is , who will ?
do you think you can crack her code ?
yep .
emma !
who does the alarm system alert ? the police .
i &apos;m the police .
two minutes for her to get a call from the alarm company .
one minute to get her coat and keys .
three minutes to drive here .
we got maybe six minutes .
i just uncovered every file
that references the tract of land she bought from gold .
nice .
what the hell do these open ?
i don &apos;t know .
what are you doing ?
looking for henry &apos;s book .
we didn &apos;t come here for henry .
we came here for the files and--
no , you didn &apos;t come here for henry .
me ? that &apos;s the only reason i &apos;m here .
what are you doing ?
some kids broke in . i heard the alarm ,
so i &apos;m checking it out &apos; cause ... i &apos;m sheriff .
well , that was an awfully quick response time .
you told me to do my job .
i &apos;m doing it .
and you brought him .
oh , well , he saw it while he was on a walk , so he &apos;s a witness .
and what did you see , sidney ?
some kids with a ...
rock .
a rock .
did they take anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;d have to do a thorough , sweep to , uh , find out .
it appears to me it &apos;s all just a prank .
you sure you don &apos;t want me to take the place apart ?
sheriff , your services are not wanted nor needed .
okay . well , you know where to find me .
it &apos;s you .
my love for you grows stronger with every beat of my heart .
but the king has read my diary ,
found my mirror .
soon he will discover the truth about us .
there is no escape .
there is always an escape .
your father said what &apos;s in this box
would give you your freedom .
yes , i believe it will .
the agrabahn viper--
a snake so deadly it can kill anything .
with a single bite .
this serpent is from my homeland .
i know all too well of its poison .
but why would you have it brought here ?
there is no happiness left for me in this life .
one small bite ...
then i shall be free from this prison forever .
i &apos;m sorry we couldn &apos;t be together , my love .
perhaps in another life , we will find each other again .
there is another way .
what if the king ...
didn &apos;t live ?
you would do that for me ?
for you , i would do anything .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you .
you will never have to find out .
what you working on ?
uh , no time to talk .
i gotta write it all down before i forget .
yeah , i hate it when great ideas slip away from me .
they &apos;re not my ideas .
they &apos;re stories from a book that i lost .
must be a hell of a book .
what &apos;s it about ?
stuff .
sounds exciting .
you seem awfully interested in me and my book .
oh . i &apos;m just being neighborly .
what are you doing in storybrooke ?
i &apos;m a writer .
you can write anywhere .
what are you really doing here ?
stuff .
good luck with the stories .
blueprints , bank statements .
what is she building out there ?
a mansion ?
well , whatever it is , it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because these escrow statements have her name all over it .
you were right . personal use .
she &apos;s done . we got her .
what &apos;s wrong ? didn &apos;t you hear me ?
we stooped to her level .
that &apos;s exactly what i promised henry i wouldn &apos;t do .
emma , we got her !
it &apos;s fruit of the poisonous tree ,
illegally obtained evidence .
it &apos;ll get thrown out in court in a heartbeat .
no , we don &apos;t need her to go to jail .
then what are we doing here ?
what you wished for-- get everyone to see who she is .
what she did to henry ,
she does to everyone .
she destroys what people love .
let me show you something .
she made me follow you .
she made me tell her everything .
she knew about your secret place weeks ago .
she just waited to destroy it
till it would hurt you and henry the most .
it &apos;s all my fault .
if you don &apos;t do this ,
i have to .
okay .
this session of the storybrooke city council will come to order .
we will begin by reading the minutes from our last meeting .
excuse me , um , madame mayor .
i have something i &apos;d like to bring to the council &apos;s attention .
this is not an open forum , sidney .
and no one on this council &apos;s interested in hearing
the boozy complaints of a disgraced reporter .
now sit down .
he &apos;s not the only one who has something to say .
ms. swan ,
this meeting is to discuss issues facing storybrooke .
like the mayor stealing thousands of dollars
from the city to build herself a second home ?
ms. swan , you will sit down immediately , or so help me--
what ? you &apos;ll punish me ?
you &apos;ll bully me like everyone else in this town ?
no .
not today .
in my hand , i am holding documents proving that
this woman , your mayor , stole funds from the city
to build herself a lavish home in the woods .
and this disgraced reporter--
you wanna know why he was really fired ?
because he stood up to her . because he questioned her .
we all know what happens to people who question the mayor .
you claim that you act in the best interest of all of us ,
but that isn &apos;t the truth , is it ?
the truth is you are a thug that doesn &apos;t care about anyone
or anything but yourself .
that is who you really are ,
and it &apos;s time for the people of storybrooke to know that .
you are right , ms. swan .
i am building a house .
a playhouse .
the accusations are true .
i did take city funds .
i wanted to build a playground so my son henry
and all the children of storybrooke
could have a special place to play ...
safely .
as for the sketch in your hands ,
it was inspired by a drawing i found
in one of my son &apos;s books .
so there you have it , ms. swan .
you &apos;ve exposed me for who i really am .
i hope you &apos;re satisfied .
forgive me .
the pain will soon pass .
you asked me to find the man who gave the mirror to your queen .
i did .
i am that man .
you gave me my freedom .
you gave me a chance to find love ,
and for that , i &apos;m forever in your debt ,
but just as you freed me ,
so must i now free your queen .
forgive me .
you were right .
i never should have made a wish .
look at her .
queen of the castle .
you know , what you did in there was commendable , ms. swan ,
but if you really want to bring her down ,
you &apos;re gonna need a strong ally .
like yourself ?
thanks ,
but i &apos;m still not interested .
oh , one can wish .
ms. swan , a word ?
alone .
i don &apos;t know what you were hoping to accomplish in there ,
but now i hope you &apos;ll go back to your job ,
which is upholding the law ,
not breaking it .
you don &apos;t think i know you broke into my office ?
don &apos;t pretend like you &apos;re so innocent .
i know you messed with the brakes on my car .
your brakes ?
are you delusional ?
why would i kill you when you just saw i had nothing to hide ?
nothing i can prove .
well , until you have something more substantial than disdain
to throw my way ,
you &apos;re gonna stay away from me ,
and more importantly , from henry .
but that &apos;s--
not open for discussion .
you &apos;ve lost the high ground , sheriff .
if i wanted to , there &apos;s not a judge in the world
that would deny me a restraining order after what you &apos;ve done .
you don &apos;t get to see my son unless i say so ,
and right now ?
i don &apos;t say so .
why are you so far away ?
come out here .
sorry , kid . i can &apos;t today .
you &apos;re undercover , aren &apos;t you , for operation cobra ?
no , henry , i &apos;m not undercover .
your mom--she doesn &apos;t want us seeing each other for a while .
you don &apos;t have to listen to her .
actually , this time , i do .
i screwed up , henry .
i got mad at your mom about you and the book
and everything and ...
well , we &apos;re just gonna have to be apart for a little while .
i don &apos;t want to be apart .
neither do i , but right now we have to .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll find a way back in .
and hey , if it &apos;s out there , henry ,
i will find your book .
good luck .
it &apos;s probably gone , and it &apos;s probably never coming back .
looks like we had the same idea .
well , if you can &apos;t beat her ,
drink .
how did we not see this ?
we did . we saw it all , right from the start .
just didn &apos;t want to look .
blinded by our anger ,
by everything .
this time .
but there are a lot more skeletons in regina &apos;s closet .
and the good news ?
you got yourself an ally .
we won &apos;t get fooled again .
it is done .
you are free , my love .
we are free to be together at last .
d @-@ did you not hear me ?
our days of imprisonment are over .
you haven &apos;t heard the news .
the palace guards found the snake .
they know it &apos;s from your country .
they know it was you who killed the king .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before they catch you .
you will be executed .
i &apos;m sorry ...
but we will never be together .
come .
i &apos;ve arranged for a boat to provide you safe passage
out of the kingdom .
you must leave at once .
the agrabahn viper .
of all the snakes in all the world ,
that is what you chose .
you wanted the murder to be traced back to me .
you ...
you fooled me .
you never loved me .
loved you ?
i wanted the king killed , and you killed him .
you are no longer of any use to me .
be grateful i &apos;m offering you an escape .
now flee the kingdom and never turn back .
i can &apos;t live without you .
i won &apos;t live without you .
did you not understand me ?
i don &apos;t love you .
there is no way we will ever be together .
there is one way .
there is still one wish remaining .
i wish ...
to be with you forever ,
to look upon your face always ,
to never leave your side .
no !
no !
no !
it looks like you got your wish .
you will be with me ...
forever .
have a seat , sidney
you &apos;ve got yourself an ally .
we won &apos;t get fooled again .
she bought it .
all of it .
masterful job , sidney ,
top to bottom .
and cutting the brakes on her car ?
inspired .
i &apos;m glad you approve .
now she trusts you .
now we can have some fun .
everything she does ,
everywhere she goes--
you &apos;ll know about it .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you , sidney .
