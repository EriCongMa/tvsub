hi .
wait , wait ! hang on , guys ! wait !
don &apos;t you need to check i.d.s ?
oh , yeah .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . huh ?
sorry , we don &apos;t offer a senior discount .
no . no , it &apos;s not for me ,
and now i really need a drink .

oh ? somebody 21 today ?
yes . yes .
military gal .
welcome , private dorchester .
that is the wrong one .
i am so very sorry .
hold on a second .
put that away !
yes , i &apos;m a huge dork
for celebrating my 21st with my family ,
but my mom was crazy excited to go to a bar with me .
or just to go to a bar .
aw , it &apos;s so nice what you two are doing .
my mother would have never taken me out for a drink .
why ? was she super strict ?
no , she would never see me as an adult .
well , except when the police came to the house .
then , she would be like ,
&quot; gloria , you go talk to them .
&quot; tell them your father was here last night .
but unbutton your shirt a little bit first . &quot;
okay , uh , the craziest thing i heard --
and there is some competition there --
is that you think this lady treats me like i &apos;m an adult .
wait , i @-@ i do treat you like an adult .
you made me change my shirt two times before we left the house
and force @-@ fed me a cheese sandwich
so i wouldn &apos;t get sloppy drunk .
no , that is just one woman offering another woman , uh ,
fashion tips and advice for casual drinking .
what do you know about fashion ?
what do you know about casual drinking ?
okay , okay . that &apos;s funny .
see , i wouldn &apos;t have laughed
at that before &apos; cause you were a kid ,
but now i &apos;m gonna laugh &apos; cause it &apos;s funny .
hi . sorry that took so long .
we got trapped by those bridesmaids over there .
yeah .
hi .
that &apos;s what happens
when you bring gay guys to a straight club .
we &apos;re like catnip to drunken
bachelorette party girls .
the problem is , they can get a little bit clingy .
but don &apos;t worry , haley . we are here for you tonight .
to haley &apos;s first drink , huh ? salud .
okay .
yeah . yeah .
ooh , it burns .
thanks again for driving me , jay .
you &apos;ve arrived at your destination .
get it ? &apos; cause we &apos;re in a german car .
i have lived a long , full life .
i will drive us into a wall .
tonight , while claire gets things started at the bar ,
jay is taking me to pick up haley &apos;s birthday present --
a new car !
phil shopped around , found something very safe
and low @-@ maintenance with lots of good reviews .
till i married her .
i &apos;m joking ! you &apos;re not low @-@ maintenance !
i doubled down .
oh , i heard you .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to go in with you ,
you know , maybe hammer out some final details ?
no . deal &apos;s already worked out .
i &apos;m just gonna pop my
herbie hancock on a few forms ,
and i &apos;ll , uh -- i &apos;ll meet you at the bar .
great . well , you don &apos;t need me .
leaving phil with a car salesman
is like covering a baby goat in barbecue sauce
and dropping it in the middle of the serengeti .
well , i @-@ it all seems to check -- wait a minute .
this can &apos;t be right .
am i allowed to sign this with a red pen ?
good catch , phil .
one quick thing -- if you really want to
do something special for your daughter ,
what do you say we throw in some upgraded wheels ?
how much would that cost ?
how much do you spend a day on a cup of coffee ?
oh , for god &apos;s sakes !
jay ?
answer the question !
a cup of coffee ? $ 3.50 .
not you !
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m just here to make sure everything &apos;s on the up @-@ and @-@ up .
um , daryl , this is my father @-@ in @-@ law , jay pritchett .
jay , you don &apos;t have to be here .
it &apos;s all worked out .
tell you what , why don &apos;t you throw in
those upgraded wheels you love so much ,
lower the drive @-@ off by $ 500 , we call it a deal ?
i &apos;m sorry , but this is the best i can do .
come on , daryl . we &apos;re all businessmen here .
we all know there &apos;s wiggle room
when we say there &apos;s no wiggle room .
so , come on . let &apos;s see you wiggle .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t wiggle .
jay , i &apos;ve already wiggled him .
no , trust me , he can wiggle .
i really can &apos;t . i --
wiggle , daryl . wiggle .
do you know where babies come from ?
lily , i &apos;m studying .
are you a nerd ?
no . why would you ask me that ?
it &apos;s friday night , and you &apos;re doing homework .
it &apos;s my senior year .
trust me , lily ,
there &apos;ll be tons of fun friday nights in my future
with artists , dignitaries , other scientists .
i didn &apos;t hear &quot; boyfriend . &quot;
you &apos;re 0 for 3 . you keep hitting me in the face .
or ... am i 3 for 3 ?
then what &apos;s the point of the apple ?
it keeps you from moving .
hey , guys , do you know where babies come from ?
lily , that &apos;s not an appropriate question .
come on . do you know or not ?
uh , yes . the stork brings them .
this dork ?
good stuff .
hey , lily , how about something to eat ?
you want some chicken nuggets ?
okay .
all right .
so , do you know how babies are made ?
yep , and i &apos;ll tell you .
but first , we &apos;re gonna need a pen
and a bagel .
why ?
well , you &apos;re gonna need to take notes , and i &apos;m hungry .
please .
okay , we can &apos;t wait any longer .
we are dying to give you our present !
guys , i said no gifts .
no , you said no gifts under $ 100 .
oh , did i ? gimme .
it &apos;s just a little something from your supercool guncles .
okay !
there is a lot of pressure when one is a gay uncle ...
or guncle .
... giving a gift to a niece as hip and chic as haley .
in the 10 years that we &apos;ve been together ,
we &apos;ve only missed the mark one time .
yeah , when claire told us what to buy ,
but we learned our lesson --
ignore claire and trust our gay instincts .
or &quot; ginstincts . &quot;
too much .
no .
oh , my god ! so cute !
really ? you think ?
yes ! totally ! super cute !
because we can return them if you don &apos;t like them .
no , no , they &apos;re good .
i love them .
if we wore the same size ,
i would have these on right now .
he &apos;s been gone a long time .
i think we hurt his feelings .
these guys don &apos;t have feelings .
he &apos;s back there making time with a secretary ,
bragging about how he &apos;s taking a couple suckers for a ride .
look . he was in the military .
so was oswald .
can you trust me
that i &apos;m gonna get you the best deal possible ?
you know what ?
why do i keep fighting you on this ?
you know what you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m behind you all the way .
well , i spoke to my manager ...
yeah .
... and i can &apos;t give you the wheels or the discount .
frankly , he &apos;s mad
that i gave you the deal that &apos;s on the table .
well , thanks , daryl . you did your best .
you , too , jay .
i guess we &apos;ll just sign and be on our way .
or we can get out of here .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , buddy .
i got a pal at the dealership closer to his house .
we &apos;re gonna take our business there . let &apos;s go , phil .
i think phil wants to take the car .
don &apos;t tell phil what he wants .
phil wants to leave .
phil ?
what are we doing ? that was a great deal .
wrong . keep walking .
jay , i need this car .
we &apos;re supposed to be at the bar in 20 minutes .
calm down . he &apos;s not gonna let us leave the lot .
you can order your appletini now
and be there before the ice melts .
you better be right about this
&apos;cause you are dead wrong about appletinis having ice .
hey ! guys , hold on a second !
yes , daryl .
you forgot your sunglasses .
happy ?
yeah .
these aren &apos;t my sunglasses .
i cannot believe haley didn &apos;t like the shoes .
oh , come on . of course she did .
no , she most certainly did not . she gave us the high voice .
&quot; they &apos;re cute ! &quot;
i know the voice .
i invented the voice . i use the voice .
wait . so , i can &apos;t pull off mid @-@ thigh shorts ?
no , you can .
pull them off and give them to somebody 20 years younger .
you &apos;re so silly !
what are you two giggling about ?
haley just asked me --
oh , you don &apos;t want to know , trust me .
no , i do . i do . i do . i do . i do . tell me .
no , you &apos;ll just be all judgy
because you want me to be this perfect , little angel .
oh , honey , no , that &apos;s not true .
i know i have not done a great job of it so far ,
but i meant it when i said
i want to have a more adult relationship .
i am sure the reason
why mom and i grew apart
is that she never stopped treating me like a child .
plus , she was loco for loco @-@ puffs .
what , you do not have that cereal ?
come on . haley , let me in .
okay , fine , so we were laughing
because we were playing &quot; would you rather . &quot;
what &apos;s that ?
and i said ,
&quot; would you rather marry george clooney
&quot; or have the best sex of your life for just one night
with tom hardy ? &quot;
who &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know . google him .
i &apos;m going with tom because george would
just want to talk about politics all the time
and tom seems like he would quietly get the job done .
that &apos;s exactly what haley said !
all right ! okay !
yeah !
hey , you two ! it &apos;s dance time !
oh , boy . here we go .
yeah , somebody &apos;s hungry for a little bit more .
we should have just told them we &apos;re straight .
we met them because you accurately
identified the bride &apos;s perfume .
you two ready to tear it up ?
oh ... well , we &apos;re kind of doing our own thing right now ,
but thank you .
come on , boys !
who are those gays ?
i don &apos;t know , but i like their look .
do you ?
really ?
yeah .
i can feel it .
this guy &apos;s gonna get us the deal we want .
i had the deal we want ,
and now it &apos;s gone ,
just like your imaginary friend who never worked here .
calm down . we &apos;re already up
three hot dogs and a pair of sunglasses .
okay , guys , i ran some numbers ,
and i can &apos;t come close to the price you had over there .
he was losing money on that car .
oh , my god .
not helping .
all right , tony , let &apos;s cut to the chase .
you either start negotiating ,
or we &apos;re gonna walk back over there and take that other deal .
well , if you can still get it ,
yeah , th @-@ that &apos;s what i would do .
you want to dance .
i don &apos;t mind . i &apos;ll lead .
$ 500 down .
sir even with the deep discounts we offer
during the hot dog @-@ a @-@ thon ,
i have never seen a deal like that .
hear that , jay ?
i won . what did i win ?
not a car !
i got to call that first guy back .
tony , clock is ticking . your move .
what &apos;s that ?
could that be from your manager , huh , perhaps ?
uh , yeah , he says that unless you buy a car ,
you can &apos;t have any more hot dogs .
okay , so , a boy and a girl meet at a frat party
and they both think each other is totally hot ,
so they pound their beers and head upstairs .
luke , stop .
she &apos;s not hearing this from you .
why not ?
you &apos;re too immature .
i &apos;m not immature , butt face .
and how would you say it ?
well , i would say they meet through friends ,
and after dating for an appropriate amount of time ,
he takes her to a romantic french bistro .
then maybe , if the mood is right -- - maybe ?
i just bought you a big french dinner .
that was your choice . i owe you nothing .
your hand was on my knee the whole time .
what was i supposed to think ?
i was expressing affection , not signing a contract .
this date is over .
come on , sexy . don &apos;t be like that .
make a baby with me .
what is going on in here ? !
nothing .
can i just say that i &apos;m glad they didn &apos;t come get us ?
exactly . who needs those clingy broads ?
&quot; broads &quot; ? does anyone say &quot; broads &quot; anymore ?
i don &apos;t know . i was trying something .
you know , maybe they just saw us with haley and they were like ,
&quot; hey , let &apos;s give those guys some space . &quot;
or they already knew those gays .
or they thought those young guys
would be better dancers than us .
no , no . since when does young equal better ?
let &apos;s show them what we got .
hey , real quick ... what have we got ?
um , well , i can raise the roof and do the cabbage patch .
okay , and i can do the &quot; single lady &quot; hand thing .
yeah , but put your neck into it
or you just look like the queen waving .
oh , good point .
okay . now you &apos;re ready .
okay , let &apos;s go .
hey , ladies !
hey , single ladies !
hey , guys !
oh , thank god . we need to tap out .
yeah , these chicks latched on and won &apos;t let go .
you know how they are with us .
no , you don &apos;t have to tell us .
we couldn &apos;t get rid of those three all night .
so , why don &apos;t you guys go ahead and split ?
we &apos;ll take over .
are you sure ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . go , go .
yes . yes . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
thank you .
we &apos;ll hold it down .
yeah , yeah .
boys , where are you going ? !
you guys , don &apos;t go !
oh , yeah , don &apos;t worry about it , ladies ,
because we are here now and we are ready to boogie .
great !
so fun !
we &apos;re gonna go hit some clubs now .
oh , clubs . that sounds rad .
cool . super dope .
yes .
you guys have fun .
what happened ?
oh , my god .
stop . we &apos;re gancient .
really ? dylan ?
dylan ?
yep . swear it .
like you cannot believe .
you know what ? i kind of get him now .
right ?
yes !
i always got dylan .
careful . you &apos;re like my grandma .
grandma ?
easy . i have stabbed closer relatives than you .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m talking to my mom about this .
honey , i told you ,
you &apos;re a grown @-@ up now .
i &apos;m gonna respect your decisions ,
and let you live your life .
it &apos;s the best gift i can give to you
on your 21st birthday ,
my friendship and unconditional acceptance .
that means so much to me right now .
you know why ?
why ?
because i want to get a tattoo tonight ,
and i was afraid you &apos;d say no .
how could she say no
after everything she just said to you ? !
how could i say no ? is there a way ?
oh , my god , mom , this is the best present ever !
could tonight get any better ? !
yes ! she can pay for it
so you can get a really big one !
i &apos;m so excited !
phil , where are you ? you have to get down here
and stop haley from getting a tattoo .
what , no , you stop her !
i can &apos;t .
i made a commitment to being her friend .
why would you do that ?
i don &apos;t know . i was trying something .
just get down here with that car , and we can distract her .
i &apos;d love to ,
but your dad played hardball
and we lost it .
how on earth did you let that happen ? !
i don &apos;t know . why don &apos;t you ask
the tweety bird on haley &apos;s neck ?
oh , god , not the neck .
she &apos;s a tough @-@ enough hire as it is .
fine , y @-@ you deal with the car . i &apos;ll deal with the tattoo .
just get here .
okay , here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
no , no , no , no . i &apos;m done listening to you .
i had a great deal .
you know how i know ?
i called the salesman at the first dealership
while you were sneaking your third hot dog ,
and it already sold .
fine . we don &apos;t need it .
here &apos;s the plan ,
we tell them haley is really sick .
oh , my god , you &apos;re sick .
good thinking ! i &apos;ll be sick
cause nobody cares about people they can &apos;t see .
i researched that car online for weeks ,
and then you swoop in with your tough @-@ guy swagger
to teach me a lesson about buying cars in the 70s !
you know , this all happened because of you ,
sitting there , covered in sweat and fear ,
undercutting my every word .
now , if you want a really good deal ,
you park your butt out here , play on your internet .
i &apos;m going old @-@ school on this sales weasel ,
and i &apos;m gonna break him in half .
is somebody helping you ?
he better be !
yes , thank you so much .
okay , i am technically in charge tonight ,
so no one tells lily
where babies come from .
i could not agree more .
i don &apos;t know why you americans
are so uptight about sex .
sex is confusing for young people ,
and she doesn &apos;t need to learn from two fuzz @-@ staches
who barely know anything themselves .
excuse me , you might want to
check my browser history .
i &apos;ve done some research .
oh . well , great . i &apos;m just gonna go vomit forever now .
what are you guys doing ?
nothing .
just talking .
not really anything .
can we finish our conversation ?
no . lily , i &apos;m sorry , but if you have questions ,
you &apos;re gonna have to ask your dads .
you don &apos;t know , do you ?
i do so .
uh @-@ huh , i know .
no , we don &apos;t . right , guys ?
no , i guess not .
no .
that &apos;s embarrassing . want me to tell you ?
what ?
hey , that &apos;s why you asked if we knew where babies came from --
because you wanted to tell us ?
yeah , you &apos;re old . you should know .
but you might want to sit down for this .
i found a tattoo shop nearby .
it has four stars on yelp , and it has military discount .
well , private dorchester reporting for duty .
you are just so helpful tonight , gloria .
you know what else you should do ?
another idea .
you should do mother @-@ and @-@ daughter tattoos ,
like -- like , uh , two halves of a heart .
or the moon and some stars .
or , like , a bird and a rifle .
oh , my god , let &apos;s do that !
i mean , not that , but , like , let &apos;s get matching tattoos !
i want to do that with you .
you do ?
yeah !
it could be , like , our special thing
that we have for the rest of our lives , just us .
and no matter where we go or what we do ,
when people ask us about our tattoos ,
we can say that they &apos;re from
the best night of our lives together .
that is so sweet .
i mean it .
i want to do it with you . will you ?
i can &apos;t believe this , but i will . i will .
i will &apos; cause i love you .
i love you , too !
i love you . i love you .
they also have piercing !
enough .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t even need to be cool anymore .
it &apos;s like , why ?
yes , exactly . why ? who cares .
besides , isn &apos;t the cooler thing not caring
if you &apos;re cool ?
yeah , and if the new cool is not caring ,
then i &apos;m supercool , not that i care .
hey , guys ! guess what . we &apos;re getting matching tattoos .
love it . we &apos;re doing it , too . we need this .
are you serious ?
are we serious ?
as serious as bert and ernie .
it was supposed to be such a great moment for me as a dad .
i was gonna walk into that bar ,
give my daughter her new car keys , and say ,
&quot; honey ...
chug that drink . we &apos;re going for a spin . &quot;
phil , put these in your purse .
i just beat your unbeatable deal by 500 samolians .
stick that in your internet .
what ?
this guy &apos;s a bulldog . he wore me down .
don &apos;t be too hard on yourself . you never stood a chance .
thank you , jay .
hop in . i &apos;ll give you a walk @-@ through .
okay .
some more good news for you -- your father @-@ in @-@ law
also talked me into two years of free satellite radio .
of course he did . the guy &apos;s always one @-@ upping me .
i work for months getting the best deal .
he walks in , bullies you down ,
and proves what a pushover i am .
let me just show you this horn .
why ? did he get an upgrade on --
my father @-@ in @-@ law can be a jerk , too , so i got to say something .
you got a much better deal than he got .
some horn , huh ?
what ?
he came groveling into my office
and begged me to lie
and say that he got the better price ,
but he paid me the difference .
how much more did he pay ?
$ 1,000 .
oh , my god , he really cares what i think about him .
more than you know .
that is one beautiful man .
hey , dumbass , enough with the horn , huh ?
i love you , too !
oh ! uh , the tattooing --
it does really hurt .
i don &apos;t think i drank enough .
so , a couple of firsts tonight .
okay , what should we get ?
it needs to be something important to us .
i @-@ is nelson mandela still in jail ?
i think it should be something just a little more personal .
okay , what about lilies for lily ?
flowers ?
be faster just to get the word &quot; gay . &quot;
i hope everybody &apos;s ready ! so beautiful .
well , check it , losers .
i am all tatted up .
ay , i &apos;m so proud of you . i can &apos;t believe you did this .
i know ! i know ! i know !
it &apos;s very sexy .
very nice .
yeah .
well , it is sanskrit for &quot; mother . &quot;
and haley &apos;s gonna get one that says &quot; daughter . &quot;
well ...
well , what ?
it &apos;s just , um ,
i @-@ i &apos;m not totally sure i &apos;m not bailing .
no . no , you &apos;re not .
but it just looks super painful ,
a @-@ a @-@ and this is nothing to do with you ,
but i don &apos;t think i want a tattoo when i have old skin .
haley , if you don &apos;t get &quot; daughter , &quot;
it &apos;s gonna look like i did this for my mother ,
and then i &apos;m gonna have to saw my leg off .
or you could just add to it .
hey , what &apos;s sanskrit for &quot; issues &quot; ?
haley , come on . you &apos;re up . let &apos;s go .
i don &apos;t know , mom . it &apos;s --
now that i see it ,
it &apos;s so permanent .
young lady , i swear to god i will spank you .
no , my god ! is that for me ? !
happy birthday , sweetheart !
thank you so much ! i love it !
please tell me you didn &apos;t get a tattoo .
no , but talk to mom ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s trying to make me .
oh , it &apos;s so cute ! can i take it for a ride ? !
of course !
when i grow up , i want to have kids .
you &apos;re not going anywhere . you &apos;ve been drinking tonight .
only &apos; cause you made me .
what are you trying to do to her ?
well , first , i want a perfect husband ...
how about you guys ? come on .
you &apos;re gonna get your tattoo , right ?
we realized we don &apos;t need one to be cool .
it seems sort of desperate .
but yours is cute .
super cute !
yeah .
... someone who takes care of me .
ay , jay . i &apos;m tired . i &apos;m hungry . take me home .
come on . we &apos;ll get you a big bowl of loco @-@ puffs .
and then we &apos;re gonna make a baby ...
oh , my gosh !
... which is easy .
you just put eggs and tadpoles
in a glass ,
and the woman has to drink it .
then , the woman and man kiss and jump on their bed .
after a year , she pees , and a baby comes out .
oh , my god .
okay , then .
now that claire has a tattoo ,
i can finally get one of my own !
so , i &apos;ve been trying to think of a phrase
that sums up the way i live my life .
i don &apos;t think small . i don &apos;t do things halfway .
i &apos;m not afraid of taking risks .
so , then , i was trying to think of
the perfect place to put it , you know ?
you don &apos;t want to put it on a @-@ a body part
that &apos;s gonna wrinkle or -- or sag too much ,
and you don &apos;t want a place where
if you wear a suit it will show .
true .
so , on my lower back ,
i would put the words &quot; go deep , &quot;
&quot; bang . &quot;
think about that .
i heard it .
&quot; do it . &quot; no .
&quot; all in . &quot;
