excuse me . it &apos;s heavy traffic in the callahan tunnel .

why are we stopping ?
please track this gps signal .

no !
tommy , we &apos;re all so proud of you .
you &apos;re on your way to bringing back rizzoli and sons .
yeah , little brother , you &apos;re finally getting it together .
hey . i told you guys not to worry .
i &apos;m a late bloomer .
we all wish you and lydia a long and happy life .
and thank you for finally giving ma what she wants .
mm . yeah ! at least one of my kids are gonna get married !
oh . thank you all .
i &apos;ve felt alone for so long .
well , now t.j. and i -- we have you .
and we &apos;re so lucky .
okay , good , now you can get busy
and make me more grandchildren .
no . ma ! come on .
hey , uh , can you , uh ,
give me another bottle of sparkling cider , please ?
thanks .
i &apos;m so relieved that tommy didn &apos;t fall apart
when pop stressed us all out with his visit .
you &apos;re gonna lose that .
so you better wear it or put it back in the safe @-@ deposit box .
i guess i should tell casey before i tell you , but ...
i &apos;m doing it , maura .
is casey leaving the army ?
yeah .
oh , come here .
i &apos;m so happy for you .
i &apos;ve always wanted to buy a triple decker
down by the water and fix it up , you know ?
and have 2.5 kids .
yeah .
please , don &apos;t turn into my mother .
no , it &apos;s -- we haven &apos;t even talked about it .
plus , you know what -- there are plenty of couples
who choose to remain childless .
yeah . i want to plan your engagement shower .
but mom loves planning .
yeah .
what ? you don &apos;t like plastic champagne glasses ?
well , you should use flutes
so you don &apos;t let the carbonation escape .
it &apos;s sparkling cider , maura .
well ...
rizzoli .
yeah . i got to pull you away .
i just got off , sir .
i &apos;ve got a situation .
a v.i.p. &apos; s been murdered . and grab frankie .
&apos;cause with detective frost on vacation , we &apos;re down a man .
yes , sir .
where is everybody ?
only sergeant korsak and officer jenkins ?
this is somebody big .
what &apos;s going on ?
i was on patrol taking an access road ,
and i recognized her .
we &apos;re lucky it was you .
he called me instead of putting it out on the radio .
who is she ?
natalie bloomfield .
wait . senator bloomfield &apos;s daughter ?
yeah .
i got to call the police commissioner .
jenkins , make sure nobody comes through .
yes , sir .
who has to tell the senator ?
that &apos;s above our pay grade .
looks like a double tap to the back of the head .
small caliber fid at close range .
.22 , maybe . execution @-@ style .
what ? you think we &apos;re looking at a hit ?
what , maura ? what is it ?
her tongue was cut out .
man , you don &apos;t do that
unless you &apos;re making a point .
was she a rat ?
wait . wait . maura , what is that ?
move her sleeve . what is that ? a tattoo ?
well , that &apos;s odd . it looks like a qr code .
yeah .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to open it with an app .
it &apos;s a tattoo .
oh , it looks similar to a matrix bar code ,
which can be read by an imaging device .
nope . it &apos;s not opening .
got a bag of toiletries , clean shirt , underwear .
frankie , we &apos;re close to the airport .
can you check and see if she &apos;s booked on any flights tonight ?
retainers . how old was she ?
25 .
all right . the governor notified senator bloomfield .
air force jet &apos;s bringing her back from dc .
we should go to her house .
yeah , the last thing we need
is the media reporting that the senator is in bpd .
dr. isles , i &apos;d like you to go with them .
yes , sir ?
natalie was booked on four flights tonight .
going to d.c. , hong kong , beijing ,
and casablanca -- all one way .
why would she be booked on four different flights ?
throw somebody off .
oh , she was engaged .
i just found the announcement .
waiman zhang .
american citizen born in beijing .
put a bolo out on him .
uh , waiman and natalie both worked
at the knowledge aggregators group .
what kind of company is that ?
intelligence gatherers .
are you guessing ?
no .
&quot; knowledge &quot; means intelligence , and aggregators are gatherers .
k.a.g. is a contractor for the nsa .
national security agency ?
what did natalie do for them ?
she was a computer engineer .
passport &apos;s here . and this .
got to be 20 grand .
natalie was on the run .
yeah , well , why would a killer leave that ?
&apos;cause something was here
that &apos;s more important than that cash .
empty laptop bags . he was after her computers .
what the hell have we stumbled into ?
chief deputy clay stephens , department of homeland security .
sergeant @-@ detective korsak .
detective jane rizzoli .
dr. isles , chief medical examiner .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
does homeland security have an interest in this ?
senator bloomfield is a personal friend .
and we work closely intelligencis .
so you &apos;re here unofficially .
valerie is a grieving mother ,
and we want to take as much off her plate as we can .
&quot; we &quot; as in homeland security ?
this is a very sensitive investigation .
we all understand that .
then you understand that politics play a role in everything .
there &apos;s no place for politics or a jurisdictional tug @-@ of @-@ war
in a murder investigation .
we &apos;re not big @-@ footing this . we &apos;re here to offer assistance .
i &apos;m unclear how .
&apos;cause homeland security doesn &apos;t investigate murders .
we have resources that you cannot imagine .
did you find the boyfriend ?
no , did you ?
no , but we will .
how about we keep you in the loop ,
and we &apos;ll give you access when we can ?
i &apos;ve worked , uh , with federal agencies multiple times .
we &apos;re all prepared to cooperate .
then i &apos;d like for you to wait
until tomorrow to begin the autopsy .
may i ask why ?
the senator has requested that a medical examiner
who &apos;s a personal friend assist .
he &apos;s flying in from california .
i understand .
i &apos;d like to process the clothing
and any other evidence tonight , though .
i &apos;ll take you to see the senator now .
thank you .
the tailor was coming tomorrow to take in natalie &apos;s dress .
she lost 15 pounds over the last two weeks .
was your daughter under any other kinds of stress ?
i mean , besides a wedding .
my daughter was an introvert -- very private .
she didn &apos;t say it , but ...
yeah , i think she may have been having wedding jitters .
uh , what can you tell us about her fiance , waiman zhang ?
i don &apos;t know him well .
but my daughter loved him .
you don &apos;t think he had anything to do with this , do you ?
do you know where he is right now ?
no .
senator , our only chance of solving your daughter &apos;s murder
is if you are as forthcoming with us as possible .
there were partisan attacks on me
when my daughter announced her engagement .
it was very hard on natalie .
she didn &apos;t want me to respond , but i had to .
what do you mean ?
because her fiance is a naturalized citizen ,
there were suggestions that he couldn &apos;t be trusted .
what did you think ?
if our government had any doubts about waiman ,
he wouldn &apos;t have been issued
a top @-@ secret security clearance at k.a.g.
what did natalie and waiman do for k.a.g. ?
i couldn &apos;t tell you .
their work fell under the national security act .
it seems strange you wouldn &apos;t know ,
given your position in the senate .
the underlying tenet , particularly now ,
with recent leaks , is need @-@ to @-@ know .
i didn &apos;t .
you could ask christopher , though .
christopher carnahan .
he &apos;s the c.e.o. of k.a.g. ?
yes .
okay .
he and my late husband were close friends .
he recruited natalie to work with him .
senator , when was the last time you heard from natalie ?
just ...
&quot; mom , catching plane . &quot; where was she going ?
she frequently went to d.c. for her work .
senator , we found 22 grand in cash in natalie &apos;s belongings .
that &apos;s not possible . she didn &apos;t have that kind of money .
she was also booked on four flights --
one to d.c. , one to bangkok , one to hong kong ,
and one to casablanca , all leaving tonight .
i don &apos;t understand why .
we believe that your daughter
was possibly fleeing the country .
no .
we &apos;ll need to process everything here .
w @-@ we &apos;re not logging it in ?
this is a very sensitive investigation , susie .
once it &apos;s logged in , anyone has access to it .
you don &apos;t think the nsa is watching us now , right ?
hmm . i wonder .
well , privacy is an illusion , susie .
what do you mean ?
well , your telephone and internet records
are all on file with the nsa .
are you -- are you sure ? - mine , too .
well , satellites , drones , security cameras ,
license @-@ plate cameras , fast @-@ pass lanes .
yes , privacy is a thing of the past .
jane &apos;s not back yet ?
she &apos;s still with the senator . can i help ?
nah , it &apos;s tommy .
i need jane . he won &apos;t listen to me .
frankie , what is it ?
he &apos;s in trouble .
he &apos;s drinking , frankie .
no , he &apos;s hammered , maura .
what happened after the engagement party ?
oh , he wouldn &apos;t talk to me .
a friend saw him in here and called me .
ahh ! that was good .
hey , maura ! want a boilermaker ?
no , thank you .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
i haven &apos;t had one of these in three years .
what about you , francis ?
let me take you home .
is it bedtime for francis ?
can i sit down ?
you got to drink !
you seem really sad .
no , i &apos;m happy .
can you tell me what made you so upset ?
you know what , frankie -- you should buy her
a nice glass of &apos; 96 chateau lafite .
you still won &apos;t have a chance ,
but at least you &apos;ll impress her if you know your wines .
shut your mouth . let &apos;s go .
do you think maura &apos;s gonna go for you ?
she &apos;s high @-@ class . you &apos;re blue @-@ collar .
come on . let &apos;s go .
oh , you gonna make me ? !
wait , wait , wait , wait .
no , no , no .
i &apos;m gonna make you , you little punk .
yeah ?
frankie , wait .
stop . stop , stop . wait .
maura , i got it !
just wait . just wait .
no , tommy ! don &apos;t ! tommy !
no !
frankie , stop him !
relax .
get off me !
tommy ! tommy .
get off me !
relax . relax .
want half ? it &apos;s tuna .
no , thank you .
it &apos;s been refrigerated .
no , it &apos;s just my stomach &apos;s been bad all day .
there &apos;s nothing on the boyfriend .
i got officers staked out at his apartment .
you wearing a ring ?
and you call yourself a detective .
yeah , had it on all night .
so when do we start calling you mrs. ?
as soon as casey gets home .
retiring after 20 years in the army ?
within reach of making general ?
he must really love you .
nah , he just misses boston .
okay , so , natalie was murdered trying to flee
to one of three places that do not have
extradition treaties with the u.s.
what &apos;s your feeling on the senator ?
any chance she &apos;s behind this ?
pretty cold to kill your kid ,
even if she was about to leak top @-@ secret intel .
well , unless your kid &apos;s a female edward snown .
i don &apos;t care how powerful she is .
if she did it , we &apos;re gonna get her .
did we check if the boyfriend hopped on a plane ?
oh , yeah . he didn &apos;t . unless he had a fake passport .
we put him on a watch list .
can &apos;t hide forever .
we got natalie bloomfield &apos;s phone records .
she really was an introvert .
only one or two calls a day for the past two weeks .
what about before that ?
good thought , jane . a lot more .
she changed her habits . she was using a burn phone .
well , natalie must have thought she was under surveillance .
makes sense if she was about to leak intelligence .
we &apos;re gonna need warrants
for natalie &apos;s apartment and office .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m just trying to decide whether i &apos;m better off
waking up judge walters or judge steinberg .
go with steinberg .
any press reporting this yet ?
no . senator &apos;s office hasn &apos;t released anything .
hey , maura .
i &apos;m at work .
okay . yeah , no , no .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s fi-- i &apos;ll be right there .
okay . okay .
everything okay ?
i &apos;m not sure .
then go find out . we can pick this up in the morning .
thanks , boss .
frankie , you really should have a plastic surgeon look at this .
it &apos;s a lip . just stitch it up .
wipe your nose . put this on your eye .
i don &apos;t have any lidocaine .
i was a hockey player .
it only hurts when it &apos;s a compound fracture .
just do it fast .
this must be very painful .
i don &apos;t want the ice , ma .
you &apos;re amazing .
he &apos;s a dick .
watch your language !
what happened ?
ask him .
shut up . don &apos;t talk to me .
don &apos;t talk to your brother like that !
i just rushed here in the middle of a huge case .
somebody better tell me what the hell &apos;s going on .
tommy was drinking .
oh . thanks a lot , maura .
he was shit @-@ faced .
tommy . why ?
&apos;cause i felt like it .
you &apos;ve been sober for three years , okay ?
what happened ?
lydia left me .
oh , my god . i knew she was no good .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s no good , ma .
tommy ...
talk .
you started drinking again .
that &apos;s why lydia left you , isn &apos;t it ?
is it ?
yeah .
oh , my god . just as everything was going good ?
why did you drink ?
pop &apos;s cancer scare just knocked me on my ass .
i fell off the wagon .
lydia said she didn &apos;t want to live with a drunk .
where &apos;s lydia ?
tommy .
where did she take t.j. ?
i don &apos;t know !
well , it &apos;s not boston joe &apos;s ,
but it &apos;s drinkable , jane .
well , it &apos;s hard to tell ,
but i found evidence of recent hair loss .
how recent ?
natalie &apos;s mother said that she dropped
a bunch of weight in the last couple of weeks .
within that time frame .
she showed additional signs of potential stress ,
including bruxism .
i know what that is because i ground my teeth
for at least three hours last night .
i couldn &apos;t sleep , either .
and it &apos;s not just my idiot brother
and my missing nephew and this poor dead girl
that kept me awake .
don &apos;t think about planning a wedding now , jane .
no , it &apos;s not that .
we &apos;re gonna do it at the justice of the peace .
i just keep worrying that something &apos;s gonna happen
to him in the last weeks when he &apos;s in afghanistan .
don &apos;t think negative thoughts .
your body will experience something
that isn &apos;t even happening .
yeah .
damn it .
what &apos;s the matter ?
the judge denied the warrant for natalie &apos;s office .
korsak thinks the feds intervened .
&quot; still waiting to see if the judge
will sign the warrant for her apartment . &quot;
it &apos;s out .
all the national news crews are in town .
how much do they know ?
no details on the shooting yet ,
but they &apos;re digging into natalie and waiman &apos;s
top @-@ secret security clearances .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before they start to speculate
that natalie was killed to keep her from leaking secrets .
hmm . how &apos;s your lip ?
good . i had a great plastic surgeon .
you want some coffee ?
love some .
good . stay have a cup .
tommy still in your apartment ?
think so . the bars don &apos;t open till 11 : 00 .
not funny .
well ...
i would like to take a look at your lip , if you don &apos;t mind ,
to make sure that there are no signs of infection .
okay ?
oh , it looks good .
no swelling , no redness .
does that hurt ?
no .
hmm . you sure ?
forgot my keys .
actually , i don &apos;t have time for coffee . see you at work .
okay , what &apos;s going on between you two ?
he is a -- a very kind and a very good person .
well , since you and i don &apos;t have time
for a touchy @-@ feely download , can you just tell me ,
are you planning to see my brother naked ?
jane , i don &apos;t want to talk about this with you right now .
you may not know this , but that one --
when he falls , he falls hard .
so you can &apos;t mess with his heart , okay ?
uh , i don &apos;t think our badges are gonna do too well here .
i can talk my way in anywhere .
well , then , you do the talking , james bond .
do you know how many private security companies
work for the nsa ?
about 2,000 . - bet you don &apos;t know this --
there are half a million non @-@ government workers
with top @-@ secret security clearance .
like natalie bloomfield .
do you know how many government agencies
there are conducting intelligence activities ?
16 .
we got the c.i.a. , d.i.a. ,
nsa , nga ,
nro , afisra ,
inscom , mcia ,
o.n.i , o.i.c.i. ,
inr , cgi , fbi ,
d.e.a. / o.n.s.i. , inr ,
and tfi .
that &apos;s very impressive . now breathe .
ah , i think they would have killed snowden
if they &apos;d been able to catch him .
i think you &apos;ve been watching too many movies .
yeah , me , too .
and , frankie , feds don &apos;t cut out tongues .
yeah , what about as a warning to other hackers and leakers ?
i don &apos;t think so .
but , you know , private intelligent companies
are stacked with ex @-@ c.i.a. and special @-@ ops guys .
the hit was slick . phew !
sorry , sergeant korsak ,
i &apos;m gonna have to turn you around .
hey , you know my name !
back up the line .
could you let christopher carnahan know we &apos;re here ?
this one &apos;s turning around .
uh , excuse me . excuse me .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s listening to you .
oh , well , homeland security
didn &apos;t have any trouble getting in .
i thought you agreed to keep us in the loop .
it looks like you don &apos;t need any help staying in the loops .
and in order for us to share , we have to investigate .
we need to get into natalie &apos;s office .
you don &apos;t have a warrant to search it .
thanks to you .
we just need to speak to natalie &apos;s boss , okay ?
look -- you &apos;re the one that said
you were friends with her mother .
if that &apos;s true , then help us find her killer .
christopher , it &apos;s good to see you .
you , too , clay . what a tragedy .
how &apos;s valerie ?
not good .
these are detectives investigating natalie &apos;s murder ?
christopher carnahan , c.e.o. , knowledge aggregators group .
how can i help you ?
you can tell us what natalie was working on .
natalie was a key member
of our cryptography and computer @-@ security section .
it &apos;s important that we know what she was doing
in the hours leading up to her death .
anything you can tell us might help .
nothing out of the routine .
you know where she was going last night ?
yeah , she left here about 7 : 00 p.m.
she went to logan to fly to d.c. for a morning security briefing .
how did she get there ?
our internal car service .
can you check your records and find out who drove her there ?
i can check right here .
well , this is strange . she canceled the car .
we think it &apos;s possible natalie may have been
about to leak some intelligence .
i can &apos;t believe that . not natalie .
what evidence do you have of that ?
she booked one @-@ way flights
to countries without extradition treaties ,
and we believe she took two laptops with her from k.a.g.
we &apos;ll do a full internal audit .
this game just changed .
this is now a matter of national security .
the missing computers are a matter of national security .
natalie &apos;s homicide is still of concern to us .
we &apos;ll see about that .
they &apos;re gonna put up a wall we won &apos;t be able to get around .
what if one of those
16 government agencies killed natalie ?
what ? security cameras can &apos;t read my lips .
we &apos;re running out of time .
hey , maura , start that autopsy .
i can &apos;t , jane .
i &apos;m still waiting for the medical examiner
that the senator sent .
okay , the homeland security guy
just said that he would like for you to wait .
that &apos;s not an official @-@ official .
that &apos;s a courtesy .
i don &apos;t like where this conversation is headed .
well , you &apos;re gonna like this even less .
you &apos;re about to lose that body .
what ? how do you know that ?
i &apos;m a good guesser .
jane , i can &apos;t cut her body .
well , you better do everything but
because it &apos;s all we &apos;ve got .
come on . come on .
how long has it been ?
1 minute and 46 seconds .
all right , close enough .
we &apos;re here to take custody of natalie bloomfield &apos;s body
and any and all evidence you &apos;ve collected .
i don &apos;t see any men in black suits anywhere .
maybe we can find a way to see into natalie &apos;s apartment .
we may not have to . the judge just signed a warrant .
nice .
what happened ?
well , the feds paid us a visit .
oh , well , i feel so much more secure , don &apos;t you ?
they took my computer . i had personal photos .
they took everything , even my handwritten notes .
hey , vince . how would you like detective king &apos;s computer ?
that looks just like my computer .
yeah , well , i swapped his out with yours ,
and they took his .
you didn &apos;t happen to save mine , did you ?
why don &apos;t you try this one ?
you know you can get in a lot of trouble for this .
well , it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
is there any news on this boyfriend ?
nothing .
but why don &apos;t we go over what we know about natalie ?
right , she was , uh -- she was stressed out .
she was losing weight . she wasn &apos;t using her cellphone .
korsak , do you still have her phone records ?
yeah .
who did she call two weeks ago
right before she stopped using that phone ?
the office , boyfriend .
wait . what &apos;s this 800 number ?
reservation desk of the logan convention center and hotel .
well , what was going on there ?
three @-@ day government intelligence community conference .
looks like 1,500 private and government
intelligence experts attended .
check the cellphone towers near that hotel .
maybe she stayed there .
yeah , she was within range of their towers for all three days .
maybe something happened at that hotel during the conference .
or maybe she met someone
and decided to leak or sell intelligence .
senator bloomfield &apos;s giving a press conference .
some claim that my daughter was about
to divulge sensitive intelligence information .
well , she got out in front of it .
the media must have been about to break it .
there could only be one explanation --
she was influenced by her fiance , waiman zhang .
maybe she knows something we don &apos;t .
hey . come on .
maura says she &apos;s got something .
susie , is anybody there ?
no , dr . isles .
all right , this is a dental mold of natalie &apos;s teeth .
mm , making a dental mold is a federal offense .
what ? !
susie , i told you i will take
full responsibility for obstructing justice .
what did you do ?
uh , well , susie , check again .
no one &apos;s coming , doctor , but please hurry .
yes , doctor , please .
i can &apos;t stare at a dental mold much longer .
you palmed natalie &apos;s retainers .
well , i , um -- they , um -- yes .
okay , that actually is obstructing justice .
oh , boy .
may i ask why ?
and why we &apos;re gathered here staring at dental contraband ?
this is natalie &apos;s maxillary upper and her mandibular lower .
she had active orthodontic treatment as a teenager .
watch this .
doesn &apos;t fit .
are you sure those are natalie &apos;s ?
yes . uh , her alignment has relapsed .
so natalie didn &apos;t wear them .
how long had it been since she did ?
years -- two to three , at least .
but we found them with her in her briefcase .
why would you take retainers that don &apos;t fit ?
you wouldn &apos;t .
she didn &apos;t pack them . somebody else did .
not the boyfriend . he &apos;d know she didn &apos;t wear them .
maura , this is great .
okay , we got to get into natalie &apos;s apartment .
why ? what will that tell you ?
if somebody else packed her things ,
that somebody was in the apartment .
mm @-@ hmm , and if we &apos;re right ,
then natalie wasn &apos;t running , she was set up .
how do we get past the feds ?
we &apos;re gonna need help .
senator , what we have to tell you about your daughter
is not something that you want
the department of homeland security to hear .
well , if it &apos;s a question of national security --
it isn &apos;t . it &apos;s of a personal nature .
clay , can you give us a minute ?
we believe your daughter was framed .
natalie &apos;s retainers were found with her body .
i was able to determine that she wasn &apos;t --
yeah , no , i ...
oh , god .
and i blamed waiman .
we had a little joke .
i told her for college graduation ,
i was giving her braces again
because she never wore the damn retainers .
i knew it .
i knew she would never betray her country .
then help us prove that .
you can &apos;t do this , valerie .
i am a senior senator of the commonwealth of massachusetts .
this warrant was issued by a state judge .
a federal judge can block it .
are you gonna tell them to move ?
come on , senator .
unless you &apos;d like to be on national news
arresting a u.s. senator .
and the chief medical examiner
of the commonwealth of massachusetts .
and three boston homicide detectives .
excuse us .
if i know clay , he &apos;s already working
on a federal court order to get us out of here .
i &apos;ll see what i can do to slow him down .
let &apos;s hope the feds missed something .
see anything on the lock ?
scratches on the tumbler . it &apos;s been picked .
well , that doesn &apos;t sound very high tech for government spooks .
google glasses still won &apos;t let you pass through walls .
interesting . she was a knitter .
maura , we brought you here
because we couldn &apos;t bring csru , remember ?
found a needle in a pencil eraser
with stained @-@ black thread .
india ink .
and a permanent marker .
ink ? what ? like making a tattoo ?
hmm , these are all supplies that could be used to
make a homemade tattoo .
natalie &apos;s wrist .
the ink is consistent with the ink that was used on her tattoo .
frank , you took a picture of it , right ?
yeah .
i mean , why would natalie give herself a homemade tattoo ?
well , it &apos;s a unique design ?
wow . that &apos;s weird . hmm ?
i don &apos;t have any cell service in here .
yeah . me , either .
and i don &apos;t have google .
the kids these days are calling it &quot; wi @-@ fi . &quot;
why would a computer @-@ engineer genius like natalie
live in a place without cell service ?
yeah , and no 25 @-@ year @-@ old i know
has an old @-@ school phone .
old @-@ school ? it &apos;s cordless .
you guys don &apos;t have those at home ?
no . kids use these .
ha ha ha , you people think you &apos;re so funny .
a 2.4 gigahertz signal would override the router .
check to see if you have cell service and wi @-@ fi now .
yeah , it &apos;s back up .
so natalie made a homemade wi @-@ fi jammer .
she was under surveillance .
and what do you do when you &apos;re under surveillance ?
you don &apos;t use electronic devices .
you go old @-@ school .
all right , so , what did the feds miss ?
what &apos;s still here that could help us ?
&quot; pick up dry cleaning . get fruit .
go to bank and deposit check . &quot;
okay , even i direct @-@ deposit .
yeah , so does she . i checked her bank records .
why else would you go to the bank ?
did you check to see if she was paying for a safe @-@ deposit box ?
yeah , she wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m such a good customer ,
my gold card gives me one for free .
did she have a credit card through her bank ?
yeah .
so maybe she had a free safe @-@ deposit box .
no payment record . you wouldn &apos;t be able to trace it .
exactly .
two red nsa badges .
the scarlet letter .
red means you &apos;re about to lose your security clearance .
so someone &apos;s threatening natalie and her fiance .
yeah , her mother , too . look at this .
&quot; kick bloomfield out of washington . &quot;
laundry bag from the logan convention center and hotel .
where natalie spent three days . what &apos;s that ?
bloody wash rag .
bodily fluid ?
it &apos;s definitely semen , but it wasn &apos;t her fiance &apos;s .
it was a different blood type .
the blood on the washcloth is a.b.
a.b. ? so the blood is natalie &apos;s ?
she was grinding her teeth , losing her hair , not eating .
what &apos;s that sound like to you ?
add blood and semen , sounds like she was raped .
yeah , the washcloth is from
the logan convention center and hotel .
i think she was raped there .
if natalie was raped at a security conference ,
why not report it ?
a @-@ and why save the washcloth ? why not her clothing ?
maybe he took her clothes
and made her shower in front of him .
he was just as careful and efficient
at raping her as he was at killing her .
rizzoli .
what ? where ?
okay , thanks .
waiman zhang just turned himself in .
the boyfriend ? to the feds ?
to us .
why did you disappear ?
natalie sent me this text .
&quot; plan &apos; x &apos; &quot; ?
this is gonna sound like something out of
&quot; the bourne identity . &quot;
try us .
we were at a conference , and something happened there .
the security conference at logan center ?
yeah .
what were you doing there ?
all the k.a.g. people were there .
i was only there the first day .
natalie was there the whole weekend .
and when i picked her up , she was different .
different ? how ?
she was really quiet , but more than usual .
yeah . she wouldn &apos;t talk to me .
and she was just crying all the time .
and that wasn &apos;t like her .
you were her fiance .
you must have had some idea of what was upsetting her .
i tried to get it out of her ,
but she said that if i knew that i would be at risk , too .
let &apos;s go back to &quot; plan &apos; x &apos; . &quot;
what we do for a living would make anybody paranoid .
natalie thought that we should have a plan
just in case we needed to disappear .
plan &quot; x. &quot;
yeah .
um , could we see your tattoo ?
natalie did that . she had one , too .
frankie .
no , i tried . it doesn &apos;t open .
i have another idea .
it &apos;s opening .
it &apos;s an encrypted link to the deep web .
i don &apos;t even want to know what that is .
my name is natalie bloomfield .
and if you &apos;ve accessed this , it means you have my body .
i pray waiman is still alive .
i &apos;m sorry , but as you know ,
your state warrant is invalid
because this is a matter of national security .
oh , shoot . wrong one .
clay , do you have the other one ?
right here .
thank you .
you were helping us the whole time , weren &apos;t you ?
oh , i can do a lot of things .
but i can &apos;t investigate a homicide .
that one &apos;s federal .
you thought you could hide behind national security ,
do whatever you wanted in your private company ?
you sought out introverted women ,
didn &apos;t think any of them would ever stand up to you .
clay , this is an abuse of power . what is going on here ?
how did you do it ?
how &apos;d you get natalie into your hotel suite ?
what ? did you tell her you had some work to go over ?
as a standard , we use cryptographic interoperability
on this d.o.d. classified document .
but , um , i added this algorithm .
she &apos;d known you forever . you were like a father to her .
and her boss .
she didn &apos;t even see it coming , did she ?
saw what ? what are you implying , detective ?
no . please . please !
please ! please stop !
it was consensual sex !
are you sure ? that &apos;s not what natalie said .
my boss , christopher carnaha , raped me .
he has me under surveillance ,
even though he thinks he got away with it ,
just as he has dozens of times before .
but he knows that i found others .
you were spying on her to make sure she wasn &apos;t talking .
and that &apos;s when you learned
she &apos;d found the other women you &apos;d raped .
they &apos;re just as afraid as i am .
but i cannot , in good conscience ,
go on with my life
and allow him to rape another woman .
you framed her and you killed her ,
you piece of crap .
clay , please .
the fact that i had sex with natalie
does not mean that i killed her .
no . no , it doesn &apos;t .
but this does .
please track this gps signal .
it &apos;s christopher .
he &apos;s got a gps jammer on his phone ,
but i think i &apos;ve got it .
track it . track it to where i am right now !
we tracked your phone right to natalie &apos;s body .
it cost her her life , but she beat you .
you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of natalie bloomfield .
don &apos;t play with your sutures .
where did you come from ?
how &apos;s your lip ?
it &apos;s fine .
you want to see how fine ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i just wanted to see what that felt like .
i &apos;m gonna go before we have an awkward conversation .
jane .
what are you doing ?
read it .
&quot; i wasn &apos;t expecting this to be so hard .
i don &apos;t know who i am if i &apos;m not a soldier .
they want me to command a battalion in the balkans .
there &apos;s room for my wife .
please come , jane . please . &quot;
i &apos;m not going .
i &apos;m not gonna marry him .
i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah , me , too .
i &apos;m not gonna leave everything
to follow him around the world .
what &apos;s in your hand ?
i think i &apos;m pregnant .
