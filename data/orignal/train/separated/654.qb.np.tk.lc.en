daddy .
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
daddy .
amanda .
we need to get our stories straight
in case her memory does return .
the guy had it out for you .
you didn &apos;t have to kill him .
frank admitted trying to kill lydia for you .
did you fix the phone ?
put it on your porch ,
and frank &apos;s wallet .
our problem is ,
we &apos;ve been playing way too nice .
amanda &apos;s on a flight to paris tonight .
i think i might just stay a while .
i was the last person in this house to defend you , mom ,
and now you &apos;ve lost me , too .
it &apos;s been written that
a lover is apt to be as full of secrets from himself
as is the object of his love from him .
for my father ,
the secrets withheld by the woman he loved
proved powerful enough to destroy him .
i &apos;m just now beginning to understand
the enormity of that burden .
hey there , early bird .
no swim this morning ?
no , just enjoyed the sunrise .
did you sleep well ?
better than you , i &apos;m guessing .
i heard you get up in the middle of the night again .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m still getting used to someone sleeping next to me .
you got any plans today ?
you &apos;re looking at &apos; em . why ?
grayson global does this
&quot; business by the beach &quot; thing every summer .
it starts off with an employee volleyball game this afternoon .
and all this time , you thought you would hate this job .
well , the jury &apos;s still out ,
but i did tell my dad i &apos;d at least give it a shot , so ...
can you come back me up ?
always .
okay , thank you .
ashley ?
lydia , everything okay ?
bring me my wheelchair .
shall i get mrs. grayson ?
no .
help me find my phone . i need to call conrad .
okay .
lydia , what on earth ?
the doctor was very specific about keeping you rested .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
yes , mrs. grayson .
oh , and , ashley ,
i &apos;ve e @-@ mailed you an updated list of her medications .
so will you please call them in
and bring them here as soon as possible ?
yes , mrs. grayson .
hey , beautiful .
want to watch me crush daniel
in a round of corporate volleyball ?
i would love to ,
but i have to run errands for little mary suicide .
the queen &apos;s treating her like a broken baby bird .
it &apos;s positively unsettling .
you have all day to run errands .
come cheer me on .
i &apos;ll meet you down there .
that boat &apos;s almost as handsome as her captain .
kara , hey .
so , uh , who &apos;s amanda ,
an old girlfriend ?
ah , it &apos;s more like a childhood crush .
so did you stay at nolan &apos;s last night ?
nah . i found a motel not too far from here .
you sail ?
no .
but i make a hell of a passenger .
all right . well , listen , i gotta open up the bar ,
but if you feel like hanging out ,
i &apos;ll take you for a spin around the harbor after lunch .
all right ?
i &apos;d like that .
so would i.
a spin ...
海边拓展活动周
look alive , ty !
side @-@ out , bitch .
yeah , yeah , yeah , listen to the new guy , huh ?
nice .
all right . come on . who &apos;s serving ?
notice how the boys managed
to get us rooting for opposing teams again .
well , tyler &apos;s nothing if not competitive .
more like driven .
speaking of ...
you didn &apos;t let the grass grow under your bum
before shacking up with his royal gorgeousness .
we are not shacking up .
he &apos;s just staying with me for a little while
until things settle down for him at home .
fat chance of that happening anytime soon .
victoria &apos;s been especially nasty
since she kicked mr. grayson out
and moved his mistress in .
i swear , these people are barking mad .
no argument there .
excuse me a second .
hello .
you &apos;ve still got a problem , ems .
or should i say ams ?
even i &apos;m getting confused .
don &apos;t tell me she didn &apos;t leave town .
okay , but , uh , i will tell you
she &apos;s got a killer bod ,
pun intended .
amanda is on the &quot; amanda , &quot;
toasting herself as we speak .
jack &apos;s boat ?
i don &apos;t believe this .
believe it .
all right , i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can .
get down here fast .
side @-@ out !
are you ready for lunch ?
i brought you lobster bisque .
i &apos;m not hungry . thank you .
victoria , you don &apos;t have to keep doing this .
i remember exactly what happened
the night of the benefit .
that &apos;s wonderful .
what exactly do you remember ?
i remember that you told me you &apos;d never accept me ,
and that your hatred ran deeper
than any apology i could ever make .
excuse me .
south hampton p.d.
come in .
detective gunther , what is this about ?
there &apos;s been a development in the frank stevens case .
we have a warrant to search your home .
i have a friend convalescing in this room .
i would appreciate it if your men would refrain
from disturbing her .
well , we won &apos;t if we don &apos;t have to .
cell towers picked up frank stevens&apos;
phone signal late last night ,
and gps tracked it to inside your property lines .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
the last time frank called me was from outside this house .
mrs. grayson ,
we know that you and
mr. stevens had regular contact .
we also know that
your husband abruptly fired mr. stevens
shortly before
checking into a hotel the night of the murder .
would you characterize mr. grayson
as a jealous man ?
sir ?
i think we found the phone .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
getting some vitamin d . you ?
why didn &apos;t you get on the plane ?
i @-@ i @-@ i got through security
and was headed for the gate
when something stopped me .
you should &apos;ve called .
i did better than that .
i went to your house .
but you were too busy with your boy billionaire .
well , i &apos;m not busy now .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m tired of running .
i need a break .
you can get a break wherer you want .
just point it out on a map ,
i will get you there .
that &apos;s not what i want .
i want a home .
i want friends .
my name &apos;s kara now , so no one has to know the truth .
it &apos;s too risky .
for me or you ?
you want to talk risky , why are you living in that house ?
look , don &apos;t bite the hand that feeds you .
you can &apos;t stay .
i don &apos;t remember asking for your permission .
now get outta the way . you &apos;re blocking the sun .
afternoon , mr. grayson , daniel .
speak of the devil .
daniel here has been giving me a blow @-@ by @-@ blow
of this volleyball tournament .
well , not my best showing i &apos;m afraid .
of course , daniel practically grew up on that stretch of sand .
a little friendly competition is good for the soul ,
don &apos;t you think ?
which is why i want both of you
to show me what you &apos;ve got at the new investor party tomorrow .
first one of you to close a high roller
keeps the full commission ,
same as all the rest of the execs .
that &apos;s quite an opportunity , sir .
you &apos;ve made the job easy .
your firm &apos;s returns
doubled the market averages last year .
yeah , albeit true , that &apos;s something my guests
are already fully aware of , tyler .
what we &apos;re selling here
is the grayson lifestyle .
and it seems , once again ,
daniel may have a slight built @-@ in advantage .
well , tyler &apos;s been living the grayson lifestyle all summer .
i &apos;d say he gets it .
ambition versus nepotism .
game on .
gentlemen .
mrs. grayson .
please take my seat .
thank you , tyler .
hello , daniel .
mother .
it &apos;s all right . we &apos;re done here .
see you boys at the new investor party .
may the best young man win .
you better watch yourself .
yeah ?
the police found frank &apos;s cell phone .
it was in our garden .
they &apos;re building a case against you , conrad .
well , it &apos;s a case they &apos;re gonna lose , victoria ,
because that phone had to have been planted .
by whom ?
well , by the same bastard
who hid the camera in lydia &apos;s apartment .
i still have a hard time believing
that you didn &apos;t install that camera .
well , i &apos;m so sorry to disappoint you , my dear ,
but i &apos;m innocent on all counts .
and i suggest you start backing me up ,
because if i end up getting framed for this ,
i &apos;m gonna see to it
that everything you cherish so dearly
is ripped from those greedy little claws of yours .
careful , conrad .
you should know by now ,
i don &apos;t respond well to threats .
who &apos;s that hottie i saw hanging out on the boat ?
it &apos;s about time you had a new prospect on the radar .
what new prospect ?
your friend kara .
i guess she decided not to take off last night after all .
what &apos;s her story ?
long and complicated .
look , i don &apos;t want to come off like i &apos;m running a block on a buddy ,
but , uh , n @-@ o , no , jack .
well , you told me never to take dating advice from you , so--
and that was last week .
look , kara &apos;s what you &apos;d call a nomad ,
doesn &apos;t stay in one place for too long , you know ?
she didn &apos;t have a problem staying half naked
on jack &apos;s boat all morning .
dec , do me a favor . watch him .
i &apos;m gonna go see if the lady would care for some refreshments
or some sunscreen .
tell me the reason my father went to jail .
he laundered money for a terrorist group
that blew up flight 197 .
so ... how bad is it , when people find out
who you really are ?
uncomfortable if you &apos;re lucky .
some of the nut jobs make a bigger deal out of it than the regular people .
but the worst is when you meet someone
who knew someone who died because of what he did .
how is it that you grew up with a dad like that
and never knew who he really was ?
you &apos;re not having second thoughts , are you ?
only if that check bounces .
it won &apos;t .
okay , let &apos;s move on .
who &apos;s jack porter ?
the boy you gave your dog sam to .
spoiler alert--
your girl talk with miss montauk didn &apos;t work .
faux @-@ amanda is still causing
boats to crash in the harbor .
i know . she doesn &apos;t want to leave .
since when do you take no for an answer ?
it &apos;s not that easy with her .
i can &apos;t just force her to leave .
i have to let her cool down before i approach her again .
just try to run interference with jack
until i figure something out .
fine .
only &apos; cause i don &apos;t want to see him
get emotionally creamed again ...
or worse .
this is your credit card fraud department .
please verify that the card ending in 6 @-@ 9 @-@ 0 @-@ 6
is currently in your possession .
oh , tyler .
don &apos;t you look rich and powerful ?
by design , yes .
what &apos;s this ?
a gift for my date .
and a promise not to stand you up this time .
are you out of your mind ?
do you know how expensive this is ?
that &apos;s precisely why i bought it .
emily will be lost in the crowd next to you .
this party will be the best thing that ever happened to us .
oh , excuse me .
hello .
$ 5,000 ...
thank you .
at dresses by vuyo ?
hmm . exactly what kind of kink are you into here , ty ?
the most expensive kind .
well , why don &apos;t you hop on over and , uh ,
bring my stolen credit card with you ?
absolutely . i have some business i &apos;d like to discuss with you as well .
i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
victoria ...
what a surprise .
daniel &apos;s not here . he should be back shortly .
actually , i came to speak with you .
may i come in ?
of course .
i don &apos;t imagine i have to tell you
that things between daniel and myself
have been strained since you &apos;ve come into the picture .
and i hope you know ,
i &apos;ve never had any intention of getting between you and your son .
and yet , here we are .
may i ask you ,
what is it about me that troubles you so much ?
call it maternal instinct .
okay .
i understand why you might not trust me .
i know i wasn &apos;t exactly forthcoming with my juvenile record ,
but we all have things in our past that we wish we could change ,
don &apos;t we ?
you missing something ?
oh , yeah . my p.c.
i could &apos;ve sworn i brought it home .
well , maybe you left it at the office .
yeah , maybe . listen ...
stay for breakfast .
it &apos;s time that amanda get to know you better .
well , i wish i could ,
but i still haven &apos;t told daniel
that i &apos;m leaving his father .
can we keep it a secret just a little while longer ?
yeah , just a little bit longer .
don &apos;t hurt my son , emily .
you &apos;ll live to regret it if you do .
the last thing i want
is for daniel to get injured in any of this .
assuming that you feel the same way ,
i think it &apos;s time that we work out our differences .
yes , i think we can both do that ,
for daniel &apos;s sake .
victoria ...
i &apos;m glad we had this talk .
i really want to make things right between us ...
especially since there &apos;s a chance that we could be family someday .
bye .
my team won , if you &apos;re interested .
the volleyball game-- you disappeared on me .
i &apos;m so sorry .
detective gunther wanted me to go down and
give a written stement about the night that frank was killed .
i didn &apos;t want to ruin your fun .
they need me to vouch for your whereabouts ?
i don &apos;t think so , but thank you .
it seems like they &apos;re moving on to other suspects .
look , the fact that they even suspected you at all--
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever forgive my mother
for putting you through that .
you know , she came over this afternoon .
to apologize ?
sort of .
well , sort of isn &apos;t good enough .
well , it might have to be .
listen , if you and i are gonna make this work ,
you can &apos;t continue to let her have all of this power over you ,
or else eventually , she &apos;s gonna get exactly what she wants .
which is what ?
to separate you
from anyone who could threaten to take you away from her .
the only way to stop your mother
is to forgive her .
thank you for the use of your card .
a man &apos;s clothes speak volumes .
mm . so do his actions , which in my estimation ,
makes you a common thief .
well , then by the same logic , it also makes you a liar .
you said you wanted to help me climb the ladder .
you don &apos;t want to play this game with me , ty .
or can you actually believe that i &apos;m as stupid
as the other people you &apos;re conning ?
no con , nolan . i like you .
i thought we had
a mutually beneficial thing going here .
you said yourself ,
you have more money than you can wrap your brain around .
besides ,
i have , uh , every intention of repaying you .
transaction denied .
cash only .
well , then cash you shall have .
all you have to do is become a client at grayson global ,
through me , of course .
there &apos;s an investor recruitment party tomorrow at the house .
and it will only cost you $ 20 million .
oh , is that all ?
pass .
why don &apos;t you think about it a little more
while we take a dip in the pool ?
you go ahead .
i &apos;m meeting a friend .
jealous . who &apos;s the lucky guy ?
someone who &apos;s never asked a thing of me .
and ...
try not to steal anything while i &apos;m out .
okay ?
oh , i learned my lesson .
cross my heart .
发送至德克兰
the night for what exactly ?
do you mind ? this is private .
i do mind .
as charming as you find that boy ,
he &apos;s not the young man for you .
yeah , because you &apos;re such an expert in the subject .
it &apos;s my life , not yours .
if you &apos;re looking for your car keys , you won &apos;t find them .
what are you doing ? give me my phone back .
you can &apos;t do this .
i just did .
victoria ...
we need to talk .
you need to rest .
you &apos;ve made such great progress today ,
i &apos;d hate to see you relapse .
good . i &apos;m going out for a little while ,
but i &apos;ll be back in an hour or so .
i &apos;ll check up on you then .
hey , uh , i &apos;m gonna go upstairs and get ready .
if charlotte gets here before i come down ,
send her up , okay ?
you got it , casanova .
cute .
and he knows it .
you okay on your drink ?
couldn &apos;t be better .
you &apos;re playing with some serious fire here , missy .
my advice ?
take the money , and ease on down the road .
sorry . i like it here .
you know , she told me about you .
said you used to visit her father in jail
like a demented stalker .
in case you hadn &apos;t noticed ,
she wants you gone .
and when emily wants somebody gone ...
believe me , they go ...
and usuay in spectacular fashion .
in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i do things on my own terms .
if emily wants me gone ,
she might have to consider the ripple effect .
where &apos;d kara go ?
i told you , pal , she &apos;s a nomad .
i &apos;m outta here .
victoria grayson at the stowaway ?
what did you put in my drink ?
excuse me .
i &apos;m looking for declan porter .
i &apos;m victoria grayson , charlotte &apos;s mother .
i &apos;m declan &apos;s brother jack .
is declan here ?
he &apos;s upstairs .
if it &apos;s all right , i &apos;d like to have a word with him .
sure .
mrs. grayson . what are you doing here ?
what &apos;s your number ?
what &apos;s my number ?
how much will it cost
to get you to stop seeing my daughter ?
are you freakin &apos; serious ?
i am freakin &apos; dead serious .
everybody &apos;s got a price . what &apos;s yours ?
look , mrs. grayson ...
i care about your daughter a lot more than
i care about your money .
i believe you .
you &apos;re an impressive young man ,
and i understand why charlotte likes you .
i like you , too .
time and experience
would tell you that , one way or another ,
this romance is going to end .
and i &apos;m trying to spare charlotte the inevitable heartache
and help you at the same time .
but i can &apos;t if you won &apos;t accept my offer .
so what &apos;s your number ?
&quot; ladies and gentlemen ,
everyone here tonight is a victim .
the ruthless monsters-- conrad and victoria grayson . &quot;
andrew rutherford--
he loves to golf , has three kids ,
worth $ 865 million .
$ 20 mil &apos;s pocket change for him .
i &apos;m curious .
why haven &apos;t you ever ask me for my business ?
you really need an answer to that ?
well , i just don &apos;t want to miss the boat
for when you become a big , huge success .
but imagine the favor i &apos;m doing you
if it turns out i &apos;m no good at it .
mm . you &apos;re a grayson .
making money is in your d.n.a.
yeah , like mad science to the frankenstein &apos;s .
for whom the bell tolls .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hello ?
multiple code reds , ems .
the talented mr. hamptons
somehow got hold
of a shredded speech by the unbreakable lydia davis .
in it , she planned to
take down conrad and victoria at the open arms gala
by exposing their role
in the entire conspiracy against your dad .
are you kidding me ?
how did we not know about this ?
well , as i recall , we were a little bit busy that night .
code red number two--
the speech piqued tyler &apos;s curiosity ,
and he did a web search on david clarke .
you think he &apos;s on to you ?
more likely ,
he &apos;s gonna try to blackmail conrad and victoria .
then why is he hitting me up for $ 20 mil
if he &apos;s got a bigger payday planned ?
wait .
you should invest with him .
what ? you do it .
oh , yeah , and how am i gonna explain that to daniel ?
all right . what &apos;s the plan ?
just keep tyler occupied
until we find lydia &apos;s speech .
commit to the buy @-@ in at the party ,
and then you can defund the investment before the deal closes .
between tyler &apos;s scheming and
amanda &apos;s homicidal tendencies ,
this is a very dangerous game
that we &apos;re playing here .
i told you , this is not a game .
god . i should never have trusted you to take down tyler .
hey , i can handle tyler .
then handle him .
yes .
it &apos;s emily thorne .
i need to see you .
hey , we &apos;re headed out for a sail .
can you open without me ?
yeah , sure . no worries . have fun .
thanks .
so ...
what did mrs. grayson want last night ?
that woman scares the pants off me .
yeah , me , too , and i wasn &apos;t wearing any .
all right . you can fill me in later .
after you .
hey . did my mom come see you last night ?
in a big way . where were you ?
oh , i &apos;m so sorry . she took my phone .
i left a message at the bar .
what did she say to you ?
yeah , look , charlotte ,
we-- we really need to talk .
hello , mr. grayson .
i &apos;ve got that . thank you .
conrad , where the hell have you been ?
victoria &apos;s been keeping me locked up in here like a prisoner .
well , why didn &apos;t you call me ?
because that witch took my phone .
she &apos;s been giving me pills .
just find me the damn wheelchair
and get me the hell out of here .
you mind if i take over ?
go for it .
you got what you wanted .
declan just broke up with me .
sweetheart , are you all right ?
no .
i &apos;m going to the movies with jill and becca .
i need to be around friends right now .
charlotte ...
i know how difficult this must be for you to understand ,
but in the long run ,
it really is for the best .
i love you .
can i have my keys back ?
of course .
my parents took me to disneyland tokyo when i was little .
i &apos;ve been wanting to go back ever since .
sorry i &apos;m late .
oh , you &apos;re just in time .
this is satoshi takeda .
he is the c.e.o. of japan &apos;s largest renewable resources company .
this is my girlfriend-- emily thorne .
he says you &apos;re a lucky man .
she is very beautiful .
i learn something new about you every day .
hai .
what--what did he say ?
uh , he said he &apos;s tired of using his translator ,
wanted to maybe go to the bar
and see why i speak japanese so well .
by all means .
she &apos;s a woman of many surprises .
i fear i &apos;m losing control .
as you were warned ,
revenge is a stony path .
remember ...
inside the viper &apos;s nest ,
you must be a viper , too .
how can i be of service ?
no . daniel &apos;s got one more year at harvard .
i didn &apos;t exactly knock his socks off , did i ?
mr. takeda was very impressed by you .
mm . right .
must have been my extensive knowledge of disneyland tokyo .
well , if you change your mind , here &apos;s my card .
best of luck with the grandkids .
nice meeting you .
same .
they seem like they only came for the free food and drink .
uptight bastards .
no , don &apos;t sour . move on to the next .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
would you mind grabbing me a drink ?
make it a stiff one .
you got it .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d show .
i &apos;m still conflicted .
look , nolan , don &apos;t string me along
if you &apos;re not planning to invest .
there are dozens of potentials here that i can be talking to .
you must have some cast @-@ iron cajones
to ask me to open my checkbook after you stole from me .
it &apos;s shocking and admirable all at the same time .
what is it you want , nolan ?
you wouldn &apos;t have come down here
if you didn &apos;t have something on your mind .
what &apos;s say we continue this negotiation in private ?
follow me .
you do make a handsome couple .
there &apos;s no denying that .
is that really your best attempt at saying you &apos;re sorry ?
no .
i &apos;m afraid the strain of things with your father
has gotten to me .
my apologies , emily .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
apology accepted .
thank you .
well , i &apos;ll leave you two alone .
be nice to your mom .
she &apos;s the only one you &apos;ll ever have .
i can see how happy she makes you .
that said , i hope you &apos;ll consider returning home
for the remainder of the summer .
with your father gone ,
i feel like a bit of a ghost in this house .
you &apos;ll be okay , mom .
just down the beach .
daniel .
if i &apos;m going to cut you a check tonight ,
i &apos;m doing it with a few conditions .
whatever you want .
don &apos;t ever lie to me or steal from me again .
you have my word .
i &apos;m gonna need a little more than that .
i want us to spend more ...
quality time together .
i &apos;m at your service .
good .
then i &apos;ll have my guy wire the funds to you next week .
perfect .
you won &apos;t regret it .
hello .
a little thank @-@ you ?
of course .
$ 20 million of them .
oh , my god .
oh , hey , ash .
oh , love the dress .
ashley , wait !
ashley .
wait a second .
ashley , stop . please .
ashley , wait . look , let me explain .
what i just saw does not need an explanation .
it &apos;s not what you &apos;re thinking .
clearly , i haven &apos;t been thinking since the minute we met .
i &apos;m such an idiot , and you &apos;re a bastard !
no , i &apos;m whatever i need to be , whenever i need to be it .
look , i thought we agreed to step up our game .
well , i didn &apos;t realize you meant
a game of tonsil hockey with nolan ross .
it &apos;s a small price to pay for his $ 20 million .
anyway , the real question is , what are you doing ?
all i see is , &quot; yes , mrs.grayson.
of course , mrs. grayson . &quot;
you really want to be her lackey for the rest of your life ?
no , of course not .
well , then stop acting like one
and get in the game like everyone else .
there you are .
you mind if i steal this gentleman away ?
please do .
tyler .
daniel ,
mr. takeda had nothing
but good things to say about you .
however , he &apos;s not willing to commit just yet .
tyler , i just spoke with nolan ross ,
and he is buying in for $ 20 million .
congratulations .
that &apos;s terrific news , sir .
you &apos;ll have your commission check
just as soon as he wires the funds .
don &apos;t ... spend it all in one place .
oh , i won &apos;t sir .
thank you , sir .
side @-@ out , bitch .
how you doing ?
never been happier .
want me to take over ?
it feels good to be in control of something , you know ?
yeah .
whenever i &apos;m out here , i get a sense of freedom
that i ...
i never feel on shore .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m exactly where i &apos;m supposed to be .
i can &apos;t tell you the last time
i felt either one of those things .
anytime you want to take her out ,
she &apos;s right here .
and so am i.
whoa , whoa , whoa . you okay ?
sorry . um ...
it &apos;s just ...
this ...
you ...
things haven &apos;t been right for me
in a very long time .
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
we &apos;re in the same boat .
is there any chance
you might stick around a little while longer ?
i want to , but , um ...
it &apos;s complicated .
yeah .
nolan said as much .
listen , whatever it is ...
i can handle it .
nolan isn &apos;t a friend of mine .
not really .
he knew my father many years ago .
so did you .
amanda ?
i want to come home , jack .
why don &apos;t you send daniel that prospectus ,
all right ? okay . enjoy .
thank you .
thank you . certainly .
i take it you &apos;re leaving .
oh , as soon as i possibly can .
yeah .
um , i moved her out earlier this evening
while you were busy stabbing people in the back .
where did you send her ?
someplace safe ,
away from you .
don &apos;t you mean away from us ?
oh , no . there is no ...
us , victoria .
not anymore .
hey . perfect timing .
did my mother call ?
she did .
how much was i worth to her ?
well , i asked for 100 grand ,
she countered with $ 25,000 .
she has that in change at the bottom of her purse .
it &apos;s a fortune to me .
it means i can get a place by the water .
you and me can get some privacy ...
whenever .
how about we start right now ?
the caterers just left .
will there be anything else ?
nothing you can help me with , i &apos;m afraid .
good night
why did you hire me ?
you &apos;re having far fewer parties than last year ,
and you &apos;ve basically made me your personal assistant .
so ...
i &apos;m just curious .
all right , then .
i hired you because you &apos;re the best at what you do ...
and because you &apos;re close with emily .
well , as close as anyone can be to a person like her .
i see .
were you surprised that she and daniel moved in together
so quickly ?
no , not entirely .
she knows how to get what she wants .
what do you mean by that ?
just that she can be ... tricky .
let &apos;s you and i go to brunch tomorrow .
and we can discuss this further .
okay . i &apos;ll make us a reservation ...
victoria .
good night .
i &apos;m sorry to stop by so late .
no , it &apos;s fine . is-- is everything okay ?
yeah , everything &apos;s ...
everything &apos;s great .
remember when i told you about the girl
who used to live here before with her dad ?
yeah , of course .
okay , well , that friend from nolan &apos;s pool ...
she &apos;s that girl .
only she doesn &apos;t want anyone to know about it
because her dad wasn &apos;t exactly popular around here ,
especially with your neighbors .
but i told her--i told her she can trust you .
you mind if i show her the swing that her dad built ?
no .
go right ahead .
emily ...
this is amanda ,
a very close , old friend of mine .
it &apos;s nice to see you again , amanda .
jack has the nicest things to say about you .
i &apos;m just so happy my home is in good hands .
it was a very special place for me and my father .
it &apos;s good to be home .
thank you .
take care of yourself .
thank you again for doing this .
i &apos;d do anything for you .
stay strong ...
amanda .
you , too ...
emily .
we all have secrets
we keep locked away from the rest of the world ...
friendships we pretend ...
relationships we hide ...
