come on , boys !
it &apos;s leap day , not sleep day !
i love leap day !
it &apos;s kind of a big deal in the dunphy house .
this year , we even got manny involved .
you &apos;re given this gift of 24 extra hours .
you can &apos;t waste it at work or school .
you have to do something extraordinary ,
something shocking .
this year , the entire family is taking a trapeze class .
how extraordinary is that ?
it was my idea .
how shocking is that ?
i can be spontaneous every four years .
i can &apos;t wait .
leap day is stupid .
you &apos;re not understanding the logic behind it .
a year is actually 365.25 days .
every four years , we gain one day .
if we didn &apos;t adjust the calendar in , say , 40 years ,
february would almost be january .
that &apos;s not my problem , and it &apos;s definitely not your problem .
look at this .
the housekeeper turned another one of my whites pink .
i can &apos;t wear this to a sports bar .
mm , they &apos;re not going to be looking at you , jay .
somebody &apos;s feeling pretty good about herself .
they &apos;re going to be watching the match .
you meant you a little bit .
okay , put it in there .
all right , very quietly ,
we &apos;re gonna go to daddy &apos;s bedroom , open the door ,
happy birthday to me .
i &apos;m 10 !
40 !
i was born february 29th ,
and there have been ten of those ... in my lifetime ,
therefore i &apos;m 10 !
it &apos;s fun .
it &apos;s so much fun .
anyway , i @-@ i &apos;ve spent the last four years
trying to figure to what kind of party to throw this one .
oh , honey , you know i &apos;d be fine
with just a nice casual evening at home with you .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t even .
no . no ! that &apos;s what he said last time .
okay , birthday boy , what &apos;s it gonna be--
rom com or horror ?
or we can do both and watch &quot; maid in manhattan . &quot;
whatcha doing ?
canceling our baby .
第三季 第十七集
okay , love to dad . bye ! mwah !
daddy , what are you doing ?
yeah , daddy , what are you doing ?
snooping for hints about your birthday ?
no , i &apos;m just excited , and i wanna be helpful .
i know party planning isn &apos;t your thing .
y @-@ you need to trust me , cam .
i know , and i do .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re gonna do anything tired ,
like appletinis or ice sculptures .
or synthetic napkins or anything mylar .
cam , that &apos;s enough !
i &apos;ve been paying for your last party for four years .
and i find it a little insulting
that you don &apos;t think i can pull this off .
you know what ?
i trust you . i &apos;m letting go .
okay .
okay ?
you know orange is over , right ?
it &apos;s a simple party . i can do it .
simple .
perfect .
yeah , just a simple party .
i &apos;m simply taking cam &apos;s favorite movie , &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot;
and turning our house into an oz @-@ themed extravaganza--
yellow brick carpet , waitstaff in full costume ,
and custom @-@ made ruby slippers for cam .
whazzup ? !
so is this safe ?
it &apos;s a trapeze .
relax . more people are killed by knife @-@ wielding strangers
than from trapezing .
i &apos;m thinking about going home now .
honey , are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m watching ...
it &apos;s so sad .
oh , no . not today .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . no , your mom &apos;s just , uh ...
feeling emotional .
she was like this last month and the month before
and the month before .
what ? ! i could kill someone !
no , i can &apos;t hear you !
this stupid phone gets no reception in this stupid house ! aah !
dear god , no .
i &apos;d heard rumors .
yeah , we all had ,
that females living or working in close quarters
could eventually get on the same ... cycle .
but i always assumed that was a story designed
to keep women out of submarine corps .
this isn &apos;t milk . what &apos;s wrong with me today ?
my brain &apos;s not working right .
no .
i can &apos;t focus ...
three legs ?
it &apos;s not fair .
i know .
oh , no ! it &apos;s sad .
oh , my god . they &apos;re gonna ruin everything .
no . we--we just need to be extra sensitive .
phil , honey , when do we need to leave ?
whenever &apos;s good for you , sweetie . maybe 20 minutes ?
20 minutes ? !
then which one is it , phil ?
is it whenever it &apos;s good for me or is it 20 minutes ? !
whenever you &apos;re ready !
it happened-- satan &apos;s trifecta .
the day i most dreaded had fallen on the day i most loved .
they &apos;re gonna ruin trapezing .
i bet they don &apos;t even catch me .
why are you so afraid of them ? they &apos;re reasonable .
why don &apos;t we just suggest they stay home ,
considering they &apos;re all on their menst--
shh !
the first rule of dealing with the cycle--
you never mention the cycle .
you tiptoe around it .
the woman &apos;s actually taken great pains
to hide the monster she &apos;s become .
but if you acknowledge it , that brings the monster forth .
my god .
and there &apos;s three of them .
it &apos;s okay .
i have a plan .
it &apos;s kind of traditional for people to lean in
when somebody says , &quot; i have a plan . &quot;
okay ...
ja ! ja ! ja ! ja !
ooh ! no !
si ! si ! si ! si !
goal !
goal !
you should call your country &quot; the never @-@ lands &quot;
because you &apos;re never--
ja , because we are never going to win .
you said that a billion times .
just go home .
why don &apos;t you dutch people go home ?
someone should shut your colombian mouth !
okay , i wanna see you try !
uh , is there a problem over here ?
yes . there is a problem , and you &apos;re married to her .
really ? well , let me make a suggestion .
why don &apos;t you sit down , i send you over a beer ,
my wife and i watch from over there ?
that way , everybody enjoys the game--
except me , &apos; cause i prefer a game where something happens .
gloria , let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go .
i thought you were going to punch that guy back there .
ah , i got 60 pounds on the kid .
yeah . it &apos;s just that i &apos;ve heard so many stories about you fighting .
and-- it &apos;s not worth the trouble .
yeah , and he has all those friends and ...
well , his friends had nothing to do with it .
i mean , sometimes it &apos;s better to take the high road .
yeah , it &apos;s better that you walked away .
gloria , i get-- i get the impression
you &apos;re disappointed i didn &apos;t punch that guy .
of course not .
who needs all that manly , protect @-@ your @-@ woman stuff ?
no , see , like , right there . you &apos;re saying one thing ,
but it feels like you mean the opposite .
no .
that &apos;s a &quot; yes . &quot;
look , jay , i just came to watch the game .
i don &apos;t want to fight .
neither do i.
i know .
so in keeping with the film ,
this area will be in black and white ,
and then an explosion of technicolor .
best part--as the guests are coming in ...
auntie em ! auntie em !
a simulated tornado .
yeah . oh , he &apos;s gonna love that .
so the appletinis are canceled ...
yes .
the little toto dog is ordered , and ...
please tell me that you are not mixing punch in costume !
oh , no ! w @-@ what is cam doing home ?
hey .
hey .
we &apos;re the monkeys .
yes , hi . hi . come on inside . quickly , quickly .
hi . okay , one second .
hey ! whatcha doing home ?
are you checking on me and the party again ?
no , no . i left my cell phone in your car
and i gotta be in touch with mama today .
she &apos;s talking to the insurance agency for the first time
to see if they &apos;re gonna rebuild grandpa &apos;s farm .
rebuild the ...
because of the tornado .
i totally missed the connection .
a month after the most devastating twister
that ever hit cam &apos;s hometown ,
i throw a party
based on gay cinema &apos;s most famous tornado .
yeah , you know , it &apos;s been a month ,
and she hasn &apos;t heard anything , and she &apos;s just beside herself .
and then you know what else ?
lily succumbed to her injuries .
your aunt lily died ?
no , the family pig .
aunt lily was a ...
we named our daughter after a pig ?
could you just witness my pain instead of criticizing ?
i just want to be in touch with my family today .
get all this tornado stuff behind me so i can enjoy ...
the fabulous party you &apos;re planning for me !
yeah ! you gotta get outta here !
okay . hey , listen . hey , cam ?
yeah ?
you just call your family , tell them i said &quot; hi . &quot;
and don &apos;t worry about being back at 6 : 00 on the dot .
there &apos;s a little breathing room .
oh , what , are you kidding me ?
the sooner i can start to party ,
the sooner i can start to forget .
but then again .
hey , if you keep running from every reminder of the tornado ,
doesn &apos;t the tornado win ?
mitchell , my grandpa runs to his pickup truck every morning
because he thinks the pitchfork is gonna come back down .
the tornado always wins .
okay , well , it &apos;s gonna be so much fun tonight !
i know ! the big 1 @-@ 0 !
4 @-@ 0 !
hey , mitchell !
i &apos;m over here !
i could &apos;ve hit you !
but you didn &apos;t ! i &apos;m doing my &quot; i love ya &quot; dance .
okay , i &apos;m doing my &quot; i love you &quot; car dance .
look at you !
stop that ! okay ! go !
this is dangerous .
okay , okay .
go .
get out of here , you .
it &apos;s my birthday !
all right , guys , come here . we need to talk .
there they are .
stop rushing us !
buddy , what &apos;s wrong ?
yes , you &apos;ve been a little off all morning .
i &apos;ve been feeling a lot of stress lately .
my head &apos;s all foggy , and i &apos;m kind of emotional .
oh . well , i sure hope you feel better soon
&apos;cause you really need your wits about you when you &apos;re trapezing .
this is weird because the three of us
haven &apos;t exactly been feeling our best today either .
really ?
i can &apos;t find my other sock !
try looking under the one you have one .
i am not you . i don &apos;t do that . see ?
oh , god , i am you .
would you mind if we sat out trapezing ?
really ?
yeah .
are you sure ? okay .
why does he do that ?
every month .
yeah , i get a little moody ,
but unrelentin physical discomfort
will do that to a person .
doesn &apos;t he know
that tiptoeing around someone like they &apos;re crazy
makes them crazy ?
all right , you and manny go ahead .
luke can just stay here with us .
wait . what ?
luke &apos;s actually looking better .
i am better .
well , let &apos;s not take any chances .
he can stay here . you go ahead .
dad ?
daddy ?
see you later , buddy .
what are we going to do ?
we leave no man behind .
i think i &apos;m just gonna go home .
we have time .
just take down the decorations and have a normal party .
yeah , and throw a boring party in our house
that looks like i just threw it together this afternoon ?
think !
okay , we have a few options .
i can get you the back room at amelia &apos;s .
spilled juice on the owner &apos;s white rug
and almost killed her toddler . next .
bowling alley ?
not classy enough . what have you got ?
you &apos;re no help . you .
well , last weekend , i did a party on a boat .
you said you were visiting your parents .
you &apos;re suffocating me .
what &apos;s this boat ? tell me about the boat .
okay , we did an elegant dinner party on a luxury yacht
for about 25 people .
it takes you around the harbor , dancing under the moonlight .
okay , okay . uh , maybe we can-- we can make a theme out of this .
you know , cam &apos;s life is like a long voyage .
sometimes choppy but--but always forward , ever forward .
we have two hours .
book it .
hey , you survived trapeze class , huh ?
didn &apos;t happen ,
and common decency prevents me from telling you why .
how was the soccer match ?
thrilling . 1 @-@ 1 tie .
one of the goals was an accident .
i &apos;m sure my mom was happy you went .
i don &apos;t know what to make of her today .
she got into it with this guy ,
and i swear she was pushing me into a fight with him .
now is that something she &apos;d want ?
i don &apos;t know .
i always thought of women as the more evolved sex .
but after today ... i &apos;ve seen things , jay .
&apos;cause , you know , i had my share of fights in my time .
you know that .
it &apos;s too warm for me .
yeah , i remember this time i was crossing the street with dede ,
and some jackass almost clipped her .
i had the guy on the ground , my foot on his neck ,
before the car stopped moving .
yeah , we &apos;ve heard all those stories .
maybe my mom wouldn &apos;t mind a glimpse of that jay .
that &apos;s her .
she wants me to help pick out cam &apos;s gift .
i &apos;m still that guy , you know . 100 % .
what the hell ? how do you cut your finger on a cracker ?
anyway , if i thought there was a fight worth fighting ,
i &apos;d fight it .
ow ! now i got salt in this . that stings !
next time , don &apos;t scream at your boss
so that he doesn &apos;t make you work during the weekends .
si . adios .
hey , mom . who were you yelling at ?
your father , baby .
he cannot make it this weekend .
okay , i admit it .
i wanted jay to kick that little dutch man &apos;s ass at the bar .
but two seconds on the phone with javier ,
and i remember what that stupid hothead behavior gets you-
nothing .
it &apos;s better to be calm like jay .
like jay and me . like jay .
i &apos;m back !
wouldn &apos;t you know , i forgot my ding @-@ dang sunglasses .
luke , could you give me a hand ?
what were the chances that phil had come back to apologize
for all the game playing
and have an open conversation with me
about what i was feeling ?
okay , i got a bottle of fake blood out of the halloween supplies .
put a dab on your finger , say you cut it .
i say i need to run you by the doctor . easy trapezy .
got it ?
see ya on the other side , brother .
just once , i would like phil to have a little empathy ,
give me some sense that he understands what women go through .
you feeling any better ?
hate to see the whole team on the d.l.
ow ! my finger !
i don &apos;t like the sound of that .
i said a little bit !
the cap fell off . i decided to just go with it .
okay , we gotta get you out the back .
god , what happened ? !
oh , it &apos;s just a little cut .
but to be safe , i &apos;ll run him by the doctor .
no , are you crazy ? ! call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 !
no , no , they &apos;re so busy .
where &apos;s the wound ? ! we need to put pressure on it , right ?
i &apos;m gonna be sick !
my--my finger .
oh , he needs a tourniquet ! where do i put it ? !
on my finger .
stop ! there is nothing wrong with him .
luke , what &apos;s going on ?
i cut my finger ?
dad ?
how crazy is that ?
they were in my pocket the whole time . i &apos;ll see you .
phil !
what is going on , luke ?
dad staged the whole thing
so we could go on the trapeze without you three .
why ?
because ...
b @-@ because ...
because of this ! you &apos;re all monster @-@ ating !
luke , no !
are you kidding me ? ! oh , my god ! oh , my lord .
sorry ! i know you told me not to say it , but i ...
phil !
is this what you &apos;ve been teaching our son ?
that--that women are some kind of unclean lepers
that should be hidden away under sheets for a week ?
do you have any idea how offensive that it ?
i do , honey .
and from the bottom of my heart ,
i am so ...
s @-@ s @-@ scared .
ugh ! oh , no !
oh , my .
okay .
3 , 2 , 1 !
surprise !
oh , my gosh ! oh , it &apos;s amazing !
yeah , it &apos;s a boat party .
oh ! because ?
your life is like a voyage .
oh ! well , everyone &apos;s is , but i love it
because none of our other friends have ever done it .
aw . that &apos;s so sweet .
oh , it must be easy with no dirty , broken woman in the relationship .
what are you laughing at ?
okay , everybody follow the birthday flag !
what &apos;d you call me ? oh . uh , oh , yes .
oh , my gosh . it &apos;s so elegant . i &apos;ll bet pepper is dying .
oh , you know , actually , pepper couldn &apos;t come .
because he hates boats . you know , after the navy .
yeah . oh , yeah .
i guess longinus got over his fear of--of water ?
mnh . no , no .
why don &apos;t we just focus on the 30 people who are here ,
having a great time !
ew ! it smells like somebody &apos;s dead .
ugh ! what is that smell ?
that faint odor is-- is a tiny , tiny blue whale
who apparently has indeed died , uh , nearby .
but ...
si , but it &apos;s getting all over my coat .
i don &apos;t smell anything .
maybe that &apos;s because you smell like a bouquet of flowers .
oh , yeah . watch out for that .
ugh ! it smells like puke married poop
and had the ceremony in my nose .
you paint with words .
okay , don &apos;t worry , everybody .
soon we &apos;ll be way , way out at sea , bouncing on the waves
with all of his sweet @-@ smelling brothers and sisters . okay ?
mitchell pritchett ?
oh , yes . hi .
hi . i &apos;m your captain tonight . we &apos;ve got a problem .
i can &apos;t fit this many people on my boat .
no , no . i was--i was told you could take 30 .
i have exactly 30 guests .
plus six in help . you gotta drop a few people .
come on . there--there must be something that we can do here .
well , we have bigger boats ,
but this is the best i could do on two hours &apos; notice .
what is the problem ?
apparently ,
mitchell started planning my birthday party two hours ago .
mnh @-@ mnh . no . no , i @-@ i did not .
uh , apparently , we have too many people for his boat .
so ...
that &apos;s crazy .
i &apos;ve seen more people clinging to a floating door .
i &apos;m sorry , lady . it &apos;s a safety issue .
oh , no . you &apos;re going to have a safety issue
if you don &apos;t take me away from this whale .
okay , little too much finger , little too much attitude .
what &apos;s all this ?
uh , two hours of mitchell &apos;s hard work going down the drain .
look , i can &apos;t fit more than 30 people on the boat ,
as i was just explaining to the lady here .
well , first of all , that &quot; lady &quot; is my son .
he wasn &apos;t talking about me .
i was talking about her .
oh . her . oh , it &apos;s &quot; her &quot; now .
well , &quot; her &quot; happens to be my wife .
you got a problem with her , you got a problem with me .
no , no , jay ...
calm down .
i didn &apos;t have a problem before ,
but now i &apos;m starting to .
no , your problem &apos;s about to get a lot bigger .
no , jay , i know you think this is what i want , but it &apos;s not .
i &apos;ve got this , gloria .
no , jay .
i was just being stupid today . i like that you &apos;re calm ,
that you think first , and you act second .
i need that in my life .
yeah , so walk away , grandpa .
you know what ?
nobody call him &quot; grandpa &quot; !
i do .
okay , that &apos;s it !
no boat ! everybody off my dock , or i &apos;m calling the cops !
so no party now ?
no ! no , of course ! just ...
just ... just give me a minute okay ?
oh , after what you did with two hours ,
i can &apos;t wait to see what you do with a minute .
cam !
poor cam . he seems so upset .
oh , is that hard for you , phil ,
that he &apos;s have a feeling around you ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
too many emotions ?
okay , okay , i give up !
yeah , i made a mistake today .
but only because the three of you ganged up on me
like when the wolfman , dracula , and frankenstein
show up in the same movie ,
except this wasn &apos;t awesome !
i have been on an emotional roller coaster all day today .
i &apos;m afraid . i &apos;m mad . i &apos;m mad because i &apos;m afraid ,
and now i can &apos;t even think straight
because i &apos;m in so much pain from what just happened over there !
and the whole thing makes me so sad , and i &apos;m not even sure why ,
and i &apos;m nauseous from that smell but i &apos;m so hungry .
yeah .
cam , the--the boat wasn &apos;t even part of the plan .
no , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s my fault for letting my expectations get too high .
i &apos;ll get over this one , too .
no , no .
i had this whole &quot; wizard of oz &quot; party planned ,
only today i realized that it might be
a @-@ a little too tornado @-@ y .
today ?
yes !
i &apos;m sorry i @-@ i didn &apos;t make the connection , okay ?
probably &apos; cause i &apos;ve been planning for months
so that you could have the perfect party and be happy ,
which now i don &apos;t even think is possible .
oh , i &apos;m sorry that i would like to have
a nice 10th birthday party .
well , you can &apos;t have it , cam !
you wanna know why ? ! because you &apos;re 40 !
you &apos;re a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man !
i am 40 .
i &apos;m 40 .
yes .
oh , cam , stop it .
i &apos;m 40 and i &apos;m--i &apos;m on this stupid--wait , what is that ? !
oh , it &apos;s this ...
thing !
suddenly , it all made sense .
cam &apos;s craziness all day wasn &apos;t about a party .
it was about turning 40 .
and once he realized that , everything got much worse .
i &apos;ve done nothing with my life !
oh , w--stop it .
come on . how--how can you say that ?
you &apos;re--you &apos;re a wonderful father . you ...
you--you graduated from clown college .
you &apos;ve been to france .
i don &apos;t want to be 40 . it &apos;s not fair !
i know .
nothing &apos;s fair .
2 miles from here is an amusement park
full of happy families swgiging on a trapeze .
that &apos;s all i wanted for my special bonus day .
what ?
i &apos;d been trying so hard
to figure out what cam wanted for his birthday .
he &apos;d been telling me all along .
he wanted to be 10 .
seriously ? there &apos;s nothing you can do ?
i &apos;m sorry . you just missed the cutoff .
how about we see you next time ?
how about you make an exception and strap him in there ?
yeah , we &apos;re , like , ten minutes past your deadline , anyway .
and you don &apos;t want to make us angry today .
ladies , uh , i really can &apos;t make any exceptions .
&quot; ladies &quot; ?
and that was how they apologized to me .
come on , phil !
oh , god , phil !
you did it !
at least , i @-@ i think it was . i could never ask them .
this is so satisfying !
best i &apos;ve felt all day !
can i rent one of these on a monthly basis ?
yes !
oh , yay !
best 40th birthday party ever .
no , no . 10th .
really ?
yeah .
in fact , you &apos;re still that sexy little 8 year old
i fell in love with .
