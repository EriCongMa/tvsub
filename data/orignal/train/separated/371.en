The Inspiration
5-5-David,
I just saw armed suspect going south down Holden.
He's in a dark Ford Taurus,
turning right on Washington near Holden.
That's it. That's him.
In pursuit of a black Ford Taurus
going westbound on Washington, crossing State.
Arizona license plate 52B7HN.
Hold on.
Morgan!
Is he serious?
He moved in two months ago.
He's still putting together furniture?
It's only 8:00 at night.
You've got to get him to stop.
After this page, I'll go talk to him.
Talk to him? Or bludgeon him?
What, are they doing it on the floor?
I need to study now.
Put your headphones on.
You know what? If you won't do it, I will.
I said I would do it after this page.
Corin!
Open the door!
I know you're in there. I can hear you!
The whole building can!
Really? Open the door!
Hello?
Hey.
Look, I hate to be a buzz-kill,
but I have a huge test tomorrow.
My roommate's at it again, huh?
We're right below you.
I'll tell him you showed up.
Ever since he met this chick,
they've been going at it like rabbits.
Maybe they should go to her place.
I'll suggest that.
Sorry.
We were this close to going to Ocean City,
and I get the text.
I was in the middle of calculating force times distance
times the co-efficient of friction
to determine how fast I can make a hairpin turn in a Prius.
You don't have a hybrid, Spence.
I know, but if I did, I'd want to know.
Weren't we just here?
Did your date understand?
Ah, luckily we're neighbors.
You must be peeved.
I get to Dulles, make it through security,
about to board the plane to Boston,
and bam, I get the call.
I say we all demand a vacation.
From who, the guy that works 3 jobs?
Good luck with that.
Whoa, you never went home.
No, I had these unit chief
performance appraisals to do when we got back.
So how many all-nighters have you pulled this month?
I don't know. Between the file reviews and the appraisals,
there isn't enough time.
Erin would, uh, always bring her work home with her.
Yeah, I know.
She definitely underplayed the amount of paperwork.
So, how long do you think they're gonna ask you to do this double duty?
Well, they asked me if I'd be interested in the job full-time.
That would mean leaving the BAU.
I bought myself some time by asking them
to at least post the position.
Well, we both know the pros and cons.
There are lots of them.
We'll talk about it later.
Sorry you guys had to come in again. Garcia?
Yeah. Two women,
Sarah Beck and Jill Elks,
were found in a park in Glendale,
Arizona, within the last 3 days.
Both of them were single, in their late 20s,
and following their normal, low-risk routines
when they were abducted.
Where were they taken from?
Sarah was on her way to a theater group rehearsal,
and Jill was abducted from her apartment.
The unsub broke in through a window.
Well, clearly, he's hunting a specific type.
He left the jewelry untouched.
Yeah, it's not about robbery.
Both women were sexually assaulted,
and then they were shot in the heart
and left in that prayer position.
That's odd.
Maybe it's religious.
It looks like they're leaning on a cross.
Their hands are tilted forward.
He could have made them supplicate
and their hands clenched in rigor mortis.
So they're possibly praying to atone for their sins.
I doubt that.
Both women have pretty clean backgrounds.
Since the posing was done postmortem,
maybe it's a representation of the way in which
he made them beg for their lives.
We've definitely seen that before.
He's getting off on the power.
Let's head to Arizona. Wheels up in 30.
Please, please, not so fast.
Go.
I can't.
It hurts.
You're not gonna get away with this.
They're gonna find you!
"Who knows where inspiration comes from?
Perhaps it arises from desperation.
Perhaps it comes from the flukes of the universe,
the kindness of the Muses."
Amy Tan.
All right, let's go over victimology.
Both of these women were professionals, young, single, blond,
both in their late 20s, and petite.
And besides appearance, there's no apparent connection.
The prayer position is unique.
Both these women were left in parks.
The dumpsites could be symbolic.
I mean, a lot of religions
are based in nature, celebrating the outdoors.
Pilgrimages are often made to parks.
Believers say they're closer to God in places like that.
Maybe he believes they're surrogates
for a woman who cheated on him or rejected him.
Either way, the unsub participates in high-risk behavior.
He abducts and controls the victims,
takes them to secluded locations,
rapes them and kills them, all within 12 hours.
His yet to be determined ritual
leaves no outward indicators.
Well, we know he has a gun,
the ability to abduct his victims, take them to a lair,
and discard them in a park.
So he probably has a van or SUV.
And he's planned things out.
He abducted one victim on her way to a theater,
another one from her apartment.
So he stalks them.
The consistency of the disposal sites
and methodologies tells us that he has no known
or identifiable connection between any of the victims
and in fact wants them to be found
in order to convey his posed prayer message.
Well, the parks will give us behavioral clues
to help us fill out our profile.
All right, we should split up when we hit the ground.
He's probably already chosen his next victim.
You want a double shot or a regular?
Regular.
You sure, Wallace?
It's free since you work in the mall.
I'm fine.
Hey, what time do you get off?
Why, you got something planned?
You want to go sit by the fountain?
I would, but I got a date.
I gotta go.
See you tomorrow, Wallace.
Ok. Thanks.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You want her, too, Wallace?
Leave me alone.
Leave me the hell alone.
This type of detailed ritualistic behavior
typically manifests itself in multiple kills over a short period of time.
I've increased the manpower on the street.
I was even thinking about doing a press conference.
At this point, it would be better if we could conduct our analysis
without media interference.
We'll need a separate room to do interviews.
There's one over there.
Sergeant?
Yeah?
Another vic, Emma Coleman, was found in Bonsall Park.
That's a mile from here.
And two miles from the other dumpsite,
which tells us the unsub's zone of comfort is within a 3-mile radius.
I'll reroute Morgan and Rossi to the scene.
And we'll see if we can locate her next of kin.
Good. We'll need to talk to them.
All right, Rossi, talk to me.
What's up?
Only the sun. I like the sun.
Cute. That's real cute.
Look, when I was at the gym,
conversation around the free weights
is Hotch is interviewing to be Strauss' permanent replacement.
I know nothing.
Come on, man, you sure about that?
Why do I get the feeling you're being a profiler?
If you have any questions about Hotch,
maybe you should ask Hotch.
Ok, look, I get it. Doing double duty after the sequester, fine,
but taking on a desk job full-time?
You know what they say about desk jobs.
That's how you get the ladies?
No. Sitting is the new smoking.
That'll kill hotch, and you know that.
Well, it's the same as last time,
except this woman has light-brown hair.
Looks like she threw up.
Maybe it was nerves.
She knew she was going to die.
She had on a wedding ring.
It's right over there. He must have tossed it.
Strange.
Yeah, all of the other victims were single females.
Jewelry was left untouched.
So either this guy has a disdain for marriage
or his fantasy is single women.
So maybe he got rid of the ring 'cause it didn't fit his parameters.
If that's the case,
why not go after a single woman in the first place?
And why not take off the ring during the rape?
That is the question.
This is a dream, right?
You're going to tell me this is a nightmare?
We know this is difficult, Mr. Coleman.
I don't know what to say.
I need to call her parents.
Can we--can we ask you a few questions first?
When was the last time you saw your wife?
Two days ago.
Two days ago?
That's-- that's a long time.
Why didn't you call the police?
We've been separated.
Yesterday Emma was supposed to meet me at counseling,
but she never showed up.
We were doing better.
We were talking, not yelling.
In fact, she was planning on moving back in.
You didn't think it was odd that she missed your session?
I just thought she was getting cold feet.
And that maybe she still wanted to...
wanted to be with him.
Your wife was having an affair?
Do you know who he was?
I asked her, but she wouldn't tell me.
Maybe our unsub is killing cheaters.
That would explain why he poses them in the prayer position.
Or he's just gaining confidence.
The first two women were single, blond.
Now he's moved on to married ones with varying looks.
He's either changing his victimology
or he knew that the first two were unfaithful.
Hey, Garcia.
I was starting to feel like
the hottest people I know had left me at the altar,
but now you're here to kiss me with crime. What's up?
We need to get the 411 on our last victim, Emma Coleman.
She was supposedly having an affair.
Any frequently called men?
Uh, Uncle Sam. She was behind on her taxes.
How about credit cards used at a hotel?
No. Mm. She looks like me.
A lot of online shopping and indian takeout.
Any suspicious texts?
To her mother. That's about it.
All right, well, send us a list
of the 3 women she called the most this month.
Those are her BFFs.
They'll know who she's fooling around with.
Got it.
Hello?
Molly?
Stop!
Stop!
Wallace...
Please, Wallace, don't!
Why are you doing this?!
Wallace, stop!
Wallace!
Was she raped as well?
Repeatedly. Multiple lacerations to the genitalia.
And one shot through the heart.
The perfect shot, too.
What about the vomit found at the crime scene?
Are the results back yet?
It was tinged with blood.
I'm still working on the stomach.
Is that from repeated vomiting?
Possibly.
What's that?
A tooth. Looks like an incisor.
She swallowed her own?
She's not missing one. This belongs to someone else.
You think this is gonna help, Wallace?
Shut up!
You can't hurt me.
Too late.
Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.
Shut up, Heather.
No. No.
Dinnertime.
The M.E.'s report came back from the first two vics.
They also had skull fragments
and human remains in their systems.
This woman looks nothing like the last 3.
The victim pool's expanding.
So I talked to Emma's best friend
and she knew the lover's name.
Turns out he was out of town for all of the kills
and his alibi checks out.
So he's not our killer.
Guys, look.
She choked on something.
Oh, jeez, tell me that's hers.
It's not.
Well, the tongue's still from the head region.
But who's the source?
He either has a job working with dead bodies,
or that's from his first victim
who we haven't found yet.
If we stick with the religious theory,
it could be some sort of communion.
Body of Christ.
If we can identify this victim,
it'll help lead us to our unsub.
Let's bag it and run the DNA.
We're ready to give the profile.
We believe that this unknown subject
is a white male in his early 30s.
Initially he targeted white, blond women in their 20s,
but is expanding his victim pool.
His M.O. is to rape his victims
and then shoot them in the heart.
At the disposal site, he poses them as if they're praying.
He's trying to convey a message
that only he understands.
Before he kills his victims,
he forces the women to consume human flesh.
It's called projected cannibalism.
Typically cannibalism is a willing choice,
but the act of forcing someone to engage in it is a form of torture.
It tells us that the unsub is sadistic
and most likely delusional.
The emergence of those delusions
would have caused difficulties
in his relationships and jobs in the past.
He may have been institutionalized or locked up as a result.
He sees himself as an enforcer
and is punishing these women for their sins.
He may have an overly developed sense of morality
and feels the need to superimpose this on others.
Our unsub could have shot his victims anywhere,
but he chose the heart,
suggesting that he's been hurt by somebody close to him
who's clearly the center of his rage.
This is the comfort zone our unsub is operating in.
We should increase police presence within this area.
He's also devolving rapidly
and could resort to even more extreme measures to punish his victims.
Are you gonna tempt her?
Are you?
You know what's odd?
Usually in cannibalism, it's the visceral organs
and the fleshy parts being eaten.
But this unsub is making victims eat exclusively from the head.
Why?
That may be symbolic.
It's the one body part a person cannot survive losing.
All right, so why don't you two keep looking into that,
and then we can devise a neighborhood canvass questionnaire,
check for any attempted break-ins in the area.
Someone's practicing for his new role.
Look, rumor has it Hotch is putting in for Strauss' job.
See no evil, hear no gossip.
Oh, come on, we see evil all day long.
Rossi says if we want to know, we gotta ask the big man himself.
I've asked Garcia to compile a list of break-ins
in the area and also a missing persons report.
And yes, they did talk to me about the section chief job.
Do you want it?
I know what I don't want is an outsider coming in
and questioning every move that this team makes.
I told them that I'd think about it.
So what happens if you accept?
It means this would be my last case in the field,
but nothing's been decided.
And as soon as I figure out what to do,
you'll be the first to know.
We just got a lead on a parolee who fits the profile.
We're going to pick him up.
All right, Rossi, you and Morgan go check it out.
The rest of us will go over the victimology statements.
You should have told me, Heather.
But, no, I had to find out in the paper.
Mom?
What's wrong?
I've left you a bunch of messages and you never call me back.
Every time I don't call back,
it doesn't mean that there's something wrong.
Well, the ladies at the hairdresser told me that Heather's missing.
What?
What are you talking about?
She went away on business and she hasn't come back.
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.
Wallace, please tell me...
you haven't talked to her.
Of course not, mom.
Oh, god! What is that?!
What? What?
Wallace, what's wrong with you, honey?
I got to go, ma.
I don't feel well.
Liar!
Shut up!
Wallace, are you ok?
No, he's sick.
Let me in. Let me make you something to eat.
It's ok. I got to go, ma.
I got to go. I got a shift in an hour.
Wallace, please! No, please!
All right. Thanks, Morgan.
So, that parolee the sergeant had a lead on
turned out to be a bust.
What do you think about Hotch?
I think it sucks.
What do we do?
Uh, nothing.
What do you mean, nothing? I don't want him to leave.
At least he'll still be around.
Yeah, with his name on our reports.
Look, I'm sure it's been hard for him on the road.
He's not going to admit it,
but a desk job would be easier on Jack.
He'll suffocate.
You don't get it.
Why? Because I don't have kids?
I would have.
Spence... you still will.
Dr. Reid, the M.E. just emailed this over.
See?
I'm sure he just misses that.
I'm gonna eat you up!
Eat you up!
Yes. Yes, I am.
That's it.
That's it.
What?
Guys, I think I figured out
why our unsub's obsessed with the human head.
The DNA reports are back in.
All of the human remains found in the victims' stomachs
are from the same person.
So what does that mean?
It's a long explanation, so bear with me.
When Pheidippides ran a marathon, he had faith.
He also died. Go on.
True. If you take the fact that our unsub performs
forced sexual acts with his victims,
then add to that the force-feeding of a human head
and the posed prayer position,
I know this sounds crazy,
but I think our unsub is obsessed with the praying mantis.
That also explains why he poses the victims' hands like this
instead of like this.
The praying mantis can kill any of a multitude of creatures,
but the most interesting fact is that oftentimes the female mantis
engages in sexual cannibalism,
meaning she'll bite off the head of her mate
once copulation is complete,
sometimes even during intercourse, actually.
So that's what someone did to our unsub.
It also explains why he shoots his victims through the heart.
But the center of our unsub's anger didn't bite off his head.
No, but she hurt him so badly that she got into his brain.
So he's flipping the script.
He's completely taking it over.
He basically sees the victims
as the praying mantis out to destroy him,
so before they can get to him, he rapes them,
forces them to engage in cannibalism,
thereby taking away their control of the situation.
He's essentially walking them through
the mating behavior of a captive praying mantis,
only entirely on his terms.
He even mirrors the decapitation of the insect
by forcing them to eat pieces of a human head,
only it's not a male human head, it's a female human head.
The woman that's the core of his rage.
Exactly. Now all women are his enemy.
They're his predators, and he believes they're out to get him.
Hey, Wallace.
Get away from me.
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Garcia, how are we doing on the missing persons reports?
There are 6 women that have gone missing
in the Glendale area in the last month.
Any of them from within the comfort zone?
One, but she's a kid in the middle of a custody battle.
What about surrounding areas?
That adds 8 women.
See if any of them have any connections to the area.
There's one lady, Heather Clarke,
from Phoenix, Arizona.
She went to school in the area 15 years ago.
She fits the age.
And here's a thing--
Uh, she went missing two weeks ago,
and 6 days prior to her missingness-ness-ness,
it was announced in the paper she was to be married.
Unsub must have seen that and it triggered his anger.
That would explain why he
threw away the third victim's wedding ring.
Guys, Heather has a DNA sample on file.
All right, pull that and let's compare it
to the tooth we found in the latest victim's body.
Heather...
What are you doing?
I'm not leaving, Wallace.
Shut up.
Shut up!
I'm not going to tell you again-- get out!
I would have left him for you.
Liar!
Why don't you believe me?
Because you lied to me! You never loved me!
Yes, I did, Wallace.
No!
I loved you, Wallace.
Stop lying!
I loved you.
Don't hurt me.
I loved you.
I loved you. I loved you.
I loved you!
What's going on?
Nothing.
I heard you screaming. I can't concentrate.
Then move.
What did you say?
I said move!
Because the next time you knock on my door
will be the last time you come up those steps.
Heather's DNA sample matches the tooth found in our victim's stomach.
Garcia, Heather Clarke is the victim
that our unsub's been feeding to the others.
Yikes.
See if she has any enemies.
No. She was her company's top regional manager.
She--she looks loved.
Well, the unsub's rage has probably been brewing for a long time.
And he most likely expressed his disdain for her
long before he killed her.
Baby girl, check middle and high school records.
No, zero, zero. There's nothing there.
There's got to be something.
See if her parents ever filed a restraining order.
Oh, creepy bingo.
When Heather was 16,
she broke up with a guy named Wallace Hines.
Wallace did not take the breaking up well.
He went into an emo downward spiral.
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
What happened to Wallace?
He was hospitalized.
It's ok, honey. Everything is gonna be ok.
In fact, he's been in and out of institutions for over a decade.
He suffers from acute delusional disorder.
Where is he now?
He was living with his mom until very recently.
He moved two miles away from her,
right smack in the middle of the hunting zone.
So Wallace killed Heather, and when that didn't alleviate his rage,
he began killing other women.
Send us both addresses.
Blake, you and Reid notify Heather's parents.
Wallace Hines!
Wallace, you're late.
I forgot my bag.
We got a bridal shower and a bridge club lunch.
Did you forget how to cook, too?
No.
Then go get changed. We got food to make.
His old bedroom was full of pictures of Heather,
but he's cut the heads off of all of them.
What the hell is going on?
I'm Agent Hotchner with the FBI.
We're looking for your son.
Why? Is he in trouble?
When was the last time you spoke to him?
Uh, he left me a message. He, um...
Said he was sorry.
Did he say where he was going?
What did he do?
Wallace, there was supposed to be bacon on this, man.
No problem.
There you go.
Hey, I got something.
He works at Wheeler's.
This doesn't taste right.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Time to eat.
Eat.
Wallace...
What are you doing?
Just put the gun down.
I can't do that.
These people didn't do anything to you.
No, she hurt me...
Then she ate me.
Please.
Oh, here we go.
You hurt me!
What is he talking about?
You know what I'm talking about!
You hurt me and then you ate me.
Is that what I did, Wallace?
Shut up.
Shut up!
Wallace, these people didn't do anything to you.
No, I did.
You hurt me!
Damn right I did!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Come on, Wallace.
You know I loved you.
Just do it.
Do it!
Come on, Wallace.
Hey! Drop the gun.
Drop it!
Where is he?
Through the kitchen.
We're at the east end of the garage. We don't have him.
Our suspect is on the loose.
I want an APB put out to all our officers
in neighboring jurisdictions.
Anything?
All units, all units --
we have an APB on a Wallace Hines
wanted in a shooting at Wheeler's restaurant.
He is armed and dangerous.
5-5-David,
I just saw armed suspect going south down Holden.
He's in a dark Ford Taurus,
turning right on Washington near Holden.
That's right near us.
We're approaching that location from the north.
That's it. That's him.
In pursuit of a black Ford Taurus
going westbound on Washington, crossing State.
Arizona license plate 52B7HN.
Hold on.
Morgan!
Get out of the car!
Now!
Get out of the car.
Slowly.
Turn around.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you.
So, uh, any news on the job front?
No, but they said that they wanted
to talk to me again when we got back.
I've thought a lot about it.
I don't know what to tell them.
Well, I can think of a million ways to sabotage you.
Just say the word.
Hey, what's wrong?
For two people who made a big arrest,
you look pretty unsettled.
Something was off about Wallace.
The -- the restaurant shooting
was so chaotic and disorganized.
Yeah, it was.
But when we arrested him... He was controlled.
He was together.
Yeah well, Richard Farley was like that after his rampage.
Yeah, so was Edward Allaway.
Everybody has a different reaction of being caught.
You guys did good.
Hey, sarge, look at this.
Hotchner.
Yes.
I'm sorry?
Thank you.
We got the wrong guy.
What?
The fingerprints at the restaurant don't match.
Hotch, how is that possible?
We're now going to bring you news.
Let's go to our reporter on the scene.
We're here at the corner of Washington and Market,
where Wallace Hines was
arrested for a shooting at Wheeler's earlier today.
He's also suspected in the murders
of at least 5 other women in the Glendale area,
and residents are relieved he is in custody.
Stay tuned for further updates.
Hey. You gonna buy that or what?
Josh Billings once wrote,
"There are two things in life
for which we are never truly prepared...
Twins."
