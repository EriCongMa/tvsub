My mom around?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen her this morning.
I feel like I haven't seen her in ages.
I know. She picked up some extra hours at the dirty robber.
I can't believe I'm actually going to say this,
but I miss her.
Me too.
I know. Let's make a plan to do something together tonight.
Yeah, you know what, the Bruins are in town all week.
So?
Well, so, I could get tickets for a hockey game.
I have a better idea.
How about jell-o shots and arm wrestling?
Y-- you're being sarcastic.
Come on. Let's have a girls' night.
She can go to a hockey game with Frankie.
Well, what do you want to do? Wine tasting and...waxing?
No.
No, why don't we just make dinner here,
then watch a movie together?
Oh. Okay, yeah. I like that.
But only as long as you're doing the cooking.
Great.
As long as you're doing the dishes.
Deal.
Ooh! We should watch "Iron man 3."
I don't think ma's seen that one.
No.
No "Iron man" whatever the number is.
Why don't we just see something
with a little more emotional resonance?
Okay.
As long as there are no subtitles,
I don't care how much resonance it has.
"Terms of endearment."
Isn't that the one where the daughter dies
and the mother cries?
Yes.
No.
Okay.
"Steel magnolias."
This is another dead daughter.
Is there something that you're trying to tell me?
"Mommie Dearest."
Hell, no!
Why don't we let her decide?
Decide what?
Well, we wanted to do something tonight, the three of us.
Yeah, we were thinking of having dinner,
watching a movie together.
What kind of film would you like to see?
I can't tonight.
Are you working late again?
No.
Then what's the problem?
I'm taking a class at night -- a...cooking class.
Oh, what kind of cooking?
French.
My favorite -- pot-au-feu, choucroute, steak frite.
I know. I love it.
You love it?
You love french food?
What other kind of french food do you love?
Well, I-I like it all.
French onion soup and...
French fries, french toast.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Okay.
I mean, when has my mother
ever said no to anything with us?
That would be never.
Exactly. Something is off.
At least she's being more independent.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Not when it interferes with my plans.
I love the body farm.
Isn't this amazing?
Yeah, in a "Walking dead" sort of way.
Who thinks of something like this?
Well, BCU just wanted a natural setting
in order to study the decomposition
of the dead bodies.
I just wish it was here when I was in school.
Why is she so chipper this morning?
What, are you kidding? This is like disneyland for her.
Yeah. Plenty of dead bodies to play with,
and none of the long lines.
BCU in the middle of a garbage strike?
No. Two of the research bodies were buried under trash.
A student was moving the debris aside with a little backhoe
and accidentally dug up a third body,
which doesn't seem to belong here.
What do you got?
The cyclone fence around the property is in good shape,
And there's a working padlock on the front gate.
It's not fort knox, but the place is secure.
What about security cameras?
There are only three cameras,
And they're all focused on aboveground corpses
to capture time-lapse images of decomposition.
Don't tell Maura. She'll want to watch every minute.
All right, I'll need you to watch the tape from the cameras,
see if they picked up anything that can help us out.
Corpse cam.
Can do.
Okay. Level of decomposition
indicates she's been in the ground for at least a month.
Any idea what killed her?
No obvious signs of trauma,
so I can't determine a cause of death
until I complete a full autopsy.
Somebody knew
this was the perfect place to dump a body.
I went over all this with the first cop.
Well, we'd like to hear it again.
Besides myself, students, other faculty,
groundskeepers, delivery people.
Well, what about at night? Is there security after hours?
No, but the grounds are locked up at 9:00 P.M.
by a grad student.
He's very reliable.
We'll need his name
and a list of all the other people
that have access to the property.
Of course.
So, there's no chance
that this is one of your research corpses?
No, no, it's definitely not mine.
How can you be so sure?
I was brought here to implement systems
that ensure this facility runs flawlessly,
And that's exactly what I've done.
Trust me, I-I know how many bodies are here
and precisely where they're all placed.
And yet, we've found an extra body.
Which would lead some to believe the operation isn't flawless.
So, why don't you walk us through the process
of what happens when you receive a body?
Please.
Our corpses all come from people
who have donated their body for scientific research.
When they arrive here, they're washed,
fingerprinted, photographed, and tagged,
and then each body is placed in or above the ground
and then carefully notated on this map.
I would suggest you do an inventory to make sure
there are no un-notated bodies laying around.
We will.
So, uh, if there's nothing else,
I need to get back to my students.
One more thing.
Do you know when the trash was placed
on the two research bodies?
34 days ago.
How long are you gonna be here?
I'm afraid that your presence
is interrupting my teaching schedule.
Well, I suggest you get used to working around our presence
because we're gonna be here for a while.
From an academic perspective, Dr. Carlson
is a highly respected forensic anthropologist.
Well, from a people's perspective, he's a dick.
Did he give you anything?
No, just that the research bodies
were buried and covered with trash 34 days ago.
Okay, and our victim was in the ground
for at least a month.
Mm, gives us approximately four days window
for...our body to be dumped in the ground.
I spoke to Frankie.
He doesn't know anything about a cooking class for ma.
Why is that significant?
Well, she can't keep anything to herself,
yet she doesn't tell any of us
that she's taking a cooking class?
She's up to something.
Okay. You're starting to sound
more like her mother than her daughter.
I'm telling you... just watch.
What do we know about her?
Well, she's still a Jane Doe.
I wasn't able to recover prints
due to the decomposition of the epidermis on her fingers.
So I sent out a tissue sample for DNA analysis,
but there's no way of knowing if she's even in the system.
Is a tox screen even possible?
Only through hair. The lab already has a sample.
I believe she's in her mid 30s,
based on the lack of osteoporosis
and the widening of the pelvis base.
Also, she was wearing an old housecoat
and house slippers when she was buried.
That's an odd choice for someone in her 30s.
Okay, uh, what about cause of death?
Well, there were abrasions in the tissue around the neck
and hemp fibers in the wound consistent with a rope.
But there were no fractures in the C1 or C2 vertebrae,
which would be consistent with a violent hanging.
So you think she was strangled with a rope?
If that were the case,
we'd expect to find the hyoid bone fractured, which it wasn't.
Okay, well, what is the wound consistent with?
Suicide by hanging.
Really?
So she hung herself
and then drove her body over to the body farm
and then tucked herself in under some garbage.
I don't think that happened.
Yeah, but why make this look like a suicide?
Maybe it was some sort of weird ritualistic killing.
I'll check ViCAP,
see if there have been other staged suicides.
And we got to find another way to I.D. this body.
I'm looking at all the reports
for women who have been missing for at least a month.
What about the list of everyone that had access to the body farm?
Professor Carlson hasn't sent it over yet.
You know what, you go sit in his chair
and tell him you're not leaving until he gives you the list.
You got it.
I'll go wait in my chair for the list to show up.
I will wait here in my chair for the list to show up.
This is my chair, and I defend it to the death.
So, how was it?
It is still the best in town.
Ma, you know what, I've been thinking,
and I think it's great
that you're taking a french cooking class.
Yeah, it -- it -- I've been really enjoying it.
Yeah?
Well, what have you made in class so far?
Uh, what have I made in class so far?
Well, let's see.
I made a-a really nice french dip.
Yeah?
How do you make a french dip?
How do you make a fre-- well, you, um...
You take the roast beef...
You know, you have to put it in the oven, three--
Do you remember when Frankie broke your lamp?
Yeah, my favorite green lamp?
Mm-hmm. And he kept denying it.
Yeah, but I was onto him from the get-go.
How? How did you know he was lying about it?
Because every time I asked him what happened to that lamp,
he would repeat the question to buy himself some time
to make up some kind of lame, phony excuse.
So, how do you make a french dip?
Ma, you always told me
that you don't have to take time to come up with an answer
if you're telling the truth,
and that is a tip that I still use with my suspects today.
So, I don't believe
that you're taking a french cooking class.
I just can't figure out why you'd lie to me about it.
Okay, you're right.
I'm not taking a french cooking class.
I'm taking ice-skating lessons.
What?!
Well, that's why I didn't want to tell you.
Because, ma, you're the world's worst athlete!
I am not!
What about when you took up golf?
You sprained your wrist getting the bag out of the cart.
Okay, that could have happened to anybody.
Oh, yeah?
You remember what happened when you took up tennis?
And what about when you took up swimming at the "Y"?
You almost drowned.
Well, that's because I got stuck on that safety line.
That line is there for your safety!
Why can't you be supportive?
Why can't you take up bingo?
I'm going to do what I want to do.
You shouldn't be skating, mom.
Ohh. You should not be skating.
Rizzoli.
What?
How is that even po--
Fine. Yes. Fine. I'm on my way. Okay.
Did you know that female athletes
are twice as likely to sustain concussions than male athletes?
That means, given your athletic prowess,
you're like a zillion times more likely
to end up with a traumatic brain injury.
When did you start reading Maura's medical journals?
It's not in some medical journal.
That's from a much higher source --
"ESPN SportsCenter."
Oh, boy! - You know what, ma, just --
Please, no more ice skating.
Okay?
Fine.
Thank you.
I cannot believe this. How did this happen?
That's what we're here to find out,
But we're gonna need your help, professor.
Well, I'll assist you in any way I can.
You're gonna love this.
So, my mother is not taking cooking classes.
She's taking ice-skating lessons.
Why?
I don't know. She wouldn't say.
And then when I asked her about it, she got all weir--
What is this?
A male victim in a deeper grave.
How long has he been here?
At least a year.
It appears that he has a bullet hole in the back of the head,
and since I can't see an exit wound,
it seems likely that we'll recover a slug
in the decomposed brain matter.
Male victim, gunshot wound to the back of the head --
Execution?
Hit man?
Could be for him. Less likely for her.
Any connection between the victims?
No way to know based on existing forensics.
You got to wonder if a serial killer or the mob
figured out this was the perfect place to dump a body in Boston.
Hey. You have an official cause of death?
Gunshot wound to the head.
Our victim was killed by a 0.22 caliber bullet.
I sent it to IBIS for analysis.
Anything to identify this guy?
Not so far.
How about physical? Anything set him apart?
His left tibia and fibula
were fractured below the knee years ago,
but it's a common injury that alone won't help us.
How about his clothes?
He wore a T-shirt and jeans from American wear.
I researched the brand,
and they've only been in business since 2007
and they don't make housecoats.
So we still have nothing to connect our victims.
I didn't say that.
We found a long blond hair on his T-shirt.
We think it came from our woman victim?
We don't have to speculate.
DNA testing confirms a match.
So, we know our woman had contact with our man
shortly before he was buried.
Absolutely.
Well, we know one thing for sure.
He didn't kill her.
Maybe the woman was involved in the man's murder.
Or maybe she was just a witness
and didn't think she was next.
Did we get anything from the missing person report?
There's none from the woman who's been missing for a month,
but I had Frankie and Nina refine the search.
They're now looking for couples who went missing from the area
at least a year ago.
Nice.
Oh, hey, you're gonna want to see this.
We found a married couple reported missing
just over 12 months ago.
Are they consistent with our victims?
Height and hair color.
And they disappeared right around the same time
we think our male victim was murdered.
If this is our couple, then what has the wife
been doing for the past 11 months?
And who's she been doing it with?
Who filed the missing persons report?
The wife's sister.
What's up with Susie?
Ah, she said she needed to see us.
Hey. That was fast.
It sounded important.
What do you got?
Well, I ran the bullet
we recovered from the victim's skull through IBIS
and didn't get a hit.
You had us rush all the way down here for that?
Oh, no. That's not why I called you guys.
I went on a little road trip to Maine,
and I brought back... traveling gifts.
That's for you.
Thanks.
Nice. Oh, that is so you.
And this little fella is for you.
I was in this cute little lobster shack
on the wharf in Kennebunkport,
and I ordered the special,
and the waiter pointed to the tank
and told me I had to pick my lobster.
And I just took one look at this guy, and look at him.
He looks just like you.
What are you talking about? It's a lobster.
That could be your twin.
You are crazy.
Look at his eyebrows. They look just like yours.
Lobsters don't have eyebrows.
Oh, my god! It does look like you!
Oh, give me a break.
And after I saw that face, I couldn't just leave him there
to be eaten by strangers.
Then you keep him.
I can't.
Guess what I named him.
What?
Trey.
Frankie Jr. Jr. Jr.
Yes.
No.
Yes!
You have to take him home.
He looks just like you, and he has your name.
Bye.
I just couldn't believe that she would leave without saying goodbye,
But the police told me they checked it out
and said my sister gave her notice at work.
They gave me her resignation letter.
I brought it.
Thank you.
I guess she quit her job and they moved out of their apartment.
Police told me there was no sign of foul play.
Bet the police also told you that going missing was not a crime.
What else can you tell us about them?
Oh, I-I brought pictures.
I thought you might like to see them.
They were free spirits.
My sister always talked about moving away, living off the grid.
I hope they just took off to follow their dreams.
What did her husband do for work?
He was a handyman. He could work anywhere.
Was there anything physically distinctive about them?
Scars, missing teeth, broken bones?
No, not that I know of.
Wait.
My brother-in-law broke his left leg just below the knee
in a bike accident a few years ago.
Do you know what happened to them?
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but we have discovered two bodies
that could possibly be your sister and your brother-in-law.
We could use your help, if you're up to it.
Would you know their dentist?
Dental records would help us identify them.
We had the same dentist.
Dental records match for James and Bonnie Leonard.
What is that?
Why is there a lobster in Jane's desk?
I'm playing a little joke on her.
You're poking a beehive.
Trust me. This is gonna be funny.
Trust me. You're gonna get stung.
Not this time.
Why would this time be any different?
They definitely look like free spirits.
Just like her sister said.
Nina just finished a complete background investigation on them.
Anything interesting?
Nothing out of the ordinary.
No debt, no arrests, no criminal records.
What do the neighbors say about them?
That they were a nice, ordinary couple who kept to themselves.
Of course they were.
What about a love affair gone wrong?
Nothing we've found is pointing to that.
In every picture,
Bonnie looks like the hippie her sister described,
and yet we find her buried in
an old housecoat and slippers that no woman her age would wear.
Doesn't make any sense.
Well, let's think about what we know that does make sense.
Someone had access to the body farm.
They buried our couple there
because they thought it was someplace nobody would look.
And they were almost right.
Where are we with the list of people that had access to the place?
The professor finally sent it over an hour ago.
Nina's been running criminal records
on everyone who's been in and out of there.
Good, because right now, that feels like our only lead.
Oh, hey. You're home. I got pizza from Mario's.
I'm not hungry.
Well, it's... sausage and onion.
Your favorite.
Maybe later.
Are you okay?
I hurt my ankle.
How? What did you do?
Oh, I'm sure Jane told you about my skating.
I don't know why she made such a big deal about it.
Well, I think she was just... worried about you.
What? That I would hurt myself?
Can I take a look at your ankle?
If you have to.
Okay, hold on. I'm just gonna move it a little.
Does that hurt?
Well, it-- it looks like a sprain.
Yeah, I'll be all right.
No, you need to stay off your feet as much as possible.
Honey, do me a favor.
Don't tell Jane.
I don't need her barking at me again.
You don't think she's gonna notice you limping around?
Fine. Tell her.
See, I was right. I knew she'd get hurt.
I don't think the issue is really who's right and who's wrong.
I agree. The issue is skating.
It's something she shouldn't be doing at her age.
I think it's a little more complex than that.
Complex how?
Well, the depth of your feelings
might indicate that there is a hot-button issue here,
maybe just below the surface.
Meaning...?
Maybe nothing.
Never nothing with you.
What's up, Chang?
Hey. We got the tox screen back for Bonnie Leonard.
And I have a feeling she wasn't clean.
Our victim had low levels of the tranquilizer ketamine in her system.
Special K.
This kind of low dose would allow the victim to function,
but be easily controlled.
And would play into how she was killed.
It would also explain why the hanging
looked more like a suicide than a violent murder at first.
What kind of animal would do something like this?
Oh, hey, Jane. We...
Get this.
Some sick bastard shot the husband in the head,
then abducted the wife --
Jane.
What?
I think we might have found your sick bastard.
We researched everyone.
Students, professors, groundskeepers, vendors.
And we found a former grad student
who was responsible for locking up at night.
About a year ago, he was at the body farm late one night
doing some field research.
And then he runs into Professor Carlson,
who was all dirty and agitated, right?
Carlson yells at the guy,
tells him to get out, the place is closed.
Right around the time the husband's body goes into the ground.
No wonder he didn't feel like being cooperative.
Didn't want to go to jail.
It smells in here.
Yeah. There is something fishy.
All right, well, I'm not going back to the dead zone.
Well, I'll have the professor brought in.
Maybe he'll be more cooperative on our turf.
Okay, it really smells in here.
It really smells in here.
All right. I'm gonna go get some coffee.
Does anybody want anything?
No, thanks.
I'm good. Nothing for me.
No. No, I don't want any coffee.
All right. I'll be back later.
I don't recall being there that night.
Maybe you want to think about it a little more carefully.
We have a witness that puts you at the body farm
one night right around the time
our first victim was buried there.
You can still help yourself if you'll just tell us the truth.
Now, is there anything else you would like to say to us
about that night?
I was there.
Ah. Doing what?
I'd been hired by the university to take over the body farm,
clean up the operation, and I was making my rounds.
And I discovered fresh dirt
and what looked like a set of wheel marks
leading away from a burial site.
I thought someone had removed one of the research corpses,
hauled the body off with the dolly.
I figured it was a...college prank
or, you know, maybe some sort of fraternity hazing.
Our witness said you were agitated and dirty.
Well, of course I was agitated.
I-I was brought here to make sure
things like this didn't happen.
That doesn't explain why you were covered with dirt.
I was looking around to see where the body had been taken from.
And you didn't explain any of this to the university?
No. There's no reason to.
And I confirmed that all the bodies were present and accounted for,
and I decided that what I'd seen...didn't matter.
Okay.
So, what you're telling us
is that what actually happened that night
is someone else buried a murder victim
next to one of your research corpses.
Yes.
It was buried so deep we never found it...
until...you people showed up with the ground-penetrating radar.
Where were you the first four days of last month?
I'm not sure. Why?
It's important.
Uh, Atlanta, at a conference.
Is there anything else?
Not for now. You can go.
Why did you ask him about the first four days of last month?
Because Bonnie's body was buried
within four days of the garbage being spread around.
Well played.
We need to check his alibi.
Everything okay?
She's the best detective in the building,
and yet she couldn't figure out
why her desk smelled like Captain Ahab.
So, what are you gonna do?
I had to pull the plug on the prank.
If I'd left him there any longer, he would have died.
Trey gonna wind up in a lobster pot?
Nope.
I brought him to my dentist's office.
He's got this big saltwater aquarium.
At least Susie will be happy.
I can't believe it didn't work.
It would have been a great prank.
What?
She knew the lobster was in her desk the whole time.
No way.
Yeah.
Oh, she's good.
Maura, are you positive about the length of time Bonnie was buried?
Well, uh, given the state of decomposition,
ground temperature, weather conditions,
I can say with certainty
that the body was in the ground for over 30 days. Why?
'cause it looks our best suspect has an alibi.
I don't get it.
Why kill her after holding her for 11 months?
You know, there's a complex psychological element at play here.
The housecoat and slippers feel like part of a fantasy,
probably related to domestic life.
I suspect that Bonnie broke the fantasy.
She does something that upsets him,
He snaps and hangs her.
It's clearly psychopathic behavior.
And since we can't find any similar cases in VICAP,
it's possible that this was his first attempt
to fulfill his twisted fantasy, and it went wrong.
He killed this woman five weeks ago.
Which means that he is probably out there
looking for his next victim.
Or he's already found her.
All right. Thank you.
Dr. Carlson was at the conference the first four days of last month.
Two other professors were with him the whole time.
So he was telling the truth?
Looks that way.
Hey. We found two women who went missing last week
that match the physical profile of our first victim.
A waitress. An accountant.
We got to move. You take the waitress.
I'll take the accountant.
公共会计师事务所
Why did you report Sarah Harrison missing?
I shouldn't have. It was all a big mistake.
How's that?
Well, Sarah didn't show up to work for two days,
and when I called to check on her, her phone was disconnected.
So, she came back to work?
No, but a day later,
I got her letter of resignation in the mail.
Do you still have that letter on file?
I'll have to check.
Yes, thank you.
I need you to pull Bonnie Leonard's
Letter of resignation off my desk and read it to me.
Yeah.
"Dear Mr. Phillips, I regret to inform you
that I am resigning from my position as office assistant
for Healthful Foods Distribution effective immediately.
Thank you for the support
and the amazing opportunities you've provided me --"
"during my tenure.
I have enjoyed my time with the company so much,
but I've decided to leave boston."
Wait. How did you know that?
Because Bonnie and Sarah's letter
were both written by the same person.
Our killer.
I'd bet good money Sarah's his new captive.
He must have figured out
that it's a lot easier to abduct a single woman
so you don't have to kill the husband first.
Yeah. All right.
I want you to run a full background investigation on both women.
We need to know what they have in common
if we're gonna figure out who abducted them.
I'm on my way.
You got it.
There's nothing that connects these women
except for the fact that they don't have criminal records.
Okay. We got to keep digging.
Well, they didn't live in the same part of town,
don't work in the same industry,
don't go to the same church or gym.
They don't shop at the same grocery store.
One's single, one's married.
One went to college, one didn't.
One owns her home, the other one lives in an apartment.
They couldn't be more different.
Well, there's got to be something that these women have in common.
Water.
The same guy delivered clear spring bottled water
to the office building and the body farm.
No, I checked Dr. Carlson's list.
It was a woman who delivered water to the body farm.
It is now, but I looked up her employment records,
and it turns out she's only been working the route for about 11 months,
so I checked with clear spring.
Before her, it was a man, Jeffery Tyler.
He still with the company?
No. He quit.
Dr. Carlson said he saw wheel marks leading from the grave.
Just like the dollies they use to deliver bottled water would make.
I bet he kept a key to the padlock.
You got an address for this guy?
318 Carlyle Avenue.
Let's go.
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
The tidy home is not what I expected from a deranged psychopath.
Well, you can't judge a book by its cover.
What do you got?
Family photos.
Oh, now we know why the victim wore a housecoat.
Yeah, it reminded him of dear old mom.
Looks like you were right.
This is a first draft
of Sarah Harrison's resignation letter, typos and all.
That means he's already got her.
But where is he holding her?
Call Nina. We need to know everything
that she can find on Jeffery Tyler and his family.
What do you say we tear this place apart?
Thought you'd never ask.
All this crap and not one clue as to where he's holed up.
Find something?
Beretta bobcat, .22 caliber.
I found it stuffed in a bag in the closet.
I'll bet it matches the bullet
that Maura took out of the husband's head.
Speaking of... it's Maura and Nina.
Hey. We're knee-deep in nothing.
Have you found anything on this guy?
Well, Jeffery Tyler has a long history of mental illness.
Oh, who would have guessed that?
He was hospitalized several times as a teenager for depression.
And his criminal record lists two arrests
for assault and battery of two women.
Did you find any address other than this apartment?
Just his parents' old address.
But they haven't been there for years.
His mother was murdered in 1978.
Hanged by his father.
Apple doesn't fall far from the freak tree.
His dad did 36 years in prison
and died there last year.
And that could have been the triggering incident
for his abduction/murder spree.
I looked over the trial transcripts.
The father was consumed with controlling the mother.
She disobeyed him, he killed her.
All right. What about friends,
relatives, any place that he could be holding these women?
No living relatives.
The guy was a loner.
It seems he didn't play nice with others.
There's got to be something.
Wait a minute. What about the family home?
The deed says it's still owned by Jeffery's mother and father.
We're gonna need that address.
I warned you not to go near that door.
I wasn't.
I go out for 10 minutes to get us a nice bottle of wine,
and this is what you do?
I'm sorry.
Where's my dinner?
I'll get it.
When I say I want my dinner on the table,
it damn well better be there!
I'll teach you to obey me!
Police!
Put the knife down!
You drop it or I'll cut her!
Put it down! Put it down!
You won't be cutting anybody.
God!
Get your hands behind your back.
It's okay. It's all right.
It's all your fault!
Let's go.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, ma.
I just wanted to tell you I got a movie for tonight.
I'm going out.
I figured.
To the ice rink.
Anything more you want to say about that?
Just that...
I'm sorry for giving you problems about skating.
It's not my place to tell you what you should do.
Thank you for saying that.
You're welcome.
Well, and thank you for caring about your mom.
'Cause you were right.
I shouldn't be skating at this age.
Or at any age.
Okay, watch it.
And, Ma, there are a lot of things
that are wonderful about you.
Athletics -- not one of them.
I don't even like being on the ice.
Well, what are you doing it for?
I met someone.
Ma!
And he really likes hockey and skating,
and I-I...I just wanted to be a part of his world.
I never got to do any of those things with your dad,
and I want to do them now.
Why didn't you just tell me this?
I don't know.
Probably wouldn't have made a difference anyway.
Okay, what is that supposed to mean?
We --
I don't know. I just -- I've been thinking,
and you know, I don't think that I was upset with you
because you were skating.
I think I was upset
because you were skating without me.
You want to go ice skating with me?
Yes!
I have since I was a little girl.
Yeah, but, uh...
There was never any time, was there?
I'm sorry.
It's okay, Ma.
It's okay.
Well...yeah, you got to go.
I love you.
I want you to be happy, Jane.
I want you to be happy, too, Ma.
I know.
Don't stay out too late, young lady.
Don't wait up!
Hey. Where have you been?
The Dirty Robber.
Ah. Have you been drinking?
No, I have been doing some mother/daughter bonding.
Oh, I'm sorry I missed it. I love bonding.
Well, I'm sure we will bond some more.
I did get us an action movie with emotional resonance.
"Thelma & Louise!"
But this isn't an action movie.
It's a chick flick.
Uh, agree to disagree.
"This film is a celebration
of two uniquely powerful women fulfilling their destiny
and bound together for eternity."
I'd call that a chick flick.
What? Let me see that.
No.
"This film is a celebration of two bad-ass chicks
who drive their car over a cliff."
Action flick.
Fair enough.
But you know, we have something in common
with Thelma and Louise.
Oh? How so?
Well, we're both unique individuals,
and yet we have found a common connection.
Okay, yeah. I'll buy that.
Like yin and yang.
Yin and yang?
Which one am I?
Oh, well, you're yin, of course -- shady and cool.
No, I want to be yang.
Nope. That's me. Sunny and bright.
Well, how come you always get to be the sunny one?
Because of attitude like that.
Well, I was gonna tell you something about my mom
and taking your advice, but no.
Now I'm not going to
because my attitude is so dark and shady and childish.
Jane...
No.
Please.
I didn't say childish.
Your eyes did.
Oh, come on!
Mm, it's so good, too.
Come on.
Nope.
