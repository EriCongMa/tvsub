are you telling me that
you have known about this ?
yes ! i found it !
when ?
when i was cleaning up your blood .
liz , that was weeks ago .
what else are you not telling me ?
what am i not telling you ? !
what the hell is this , and why is it in our house ?
i mean , there &apos;s a gun in here , liz , and there &apos;s --
there &apos;s passports with my face on it and , uh , these names .
who the hell is anton piere louis ?
do you really expect me to believe
that you &apos;ve never seen any of this before ?
and how much money is this anyways ?
i mean , this is a fortune .
are you serious about all this ?
is this you ?
are you interrogating me now ?
this -- it &apos;s a picture of you at the angel station hotel in boston .
yeah . so what ?
there was a murder there
that matches this gun --
an agent named victor fokin ,
a russian agent who was in the process of defecting
when he was killed before he could say anything .
are you telling me , like , what --
like , you think that i murdered a kgb defector , like i &apos;m bond ?
i &apos;m tom bond ,
and i just , uh -- between social studies and recess ,
i go around assassinating people .
i had my job interview there , liz , at the coffee shop .
that &apos;s enough .
some of the dates on these passports --
you know , i can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re accusing me of this ,
because your job is the reason
that a man came in here and cut me in half !
no . march 12 , 2011 .
your bachelor party .
in las vegas .
i &apos;ve never seen pictures .
you never will !
i was gone for 36 hours !
you can get to paris and back in 19 .
i &apos;m not gonna sit here and ...
your job -- anything that is evil or bad --
it comes from what you do , not what i do !
it &apos;s not my picture on these passports .
okay !
if you think i am guilty ,
then why don &apos;t you do something about it ?
why don &apos;t you call the fbi ?
fine .
do it . go ahead . do it .
you think i &apos;m kidding ? do you think i &apos;m kidding ?
liz , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s me .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ,
but i know that this is a huge misunderstanding .
make -- make the call .
they &apos;ll separate us .
they &apos;ll dig through your life , my life ,
with a fine @-@ tooth comb .
they &apos;ll ...
our entire lives will be up for grabs .
i got nothing to hide .
let them .
identification , please .
agent keen , 1212 @-@ 654 white bear .
i need clearance for an incoming client .
client ?
thomas vincent keen .
my husband .
was that necessary ?
i thought we were going to the fbi .
i don &apos;t work at the fbi .
what do you mean , &quot; black site &quot; ?
i don &apos;t understand . where are we ?
this is where i work , tom .
mr. keen , i need you to come with me .
wait .
make it quick .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
just tell them what happened . tell the truth .
okay .
where are they taking him ?
if i were you , i &apos;d worry about myself .
i &apos;m looking at it right now .
it &apos;s beautiful .
what ? oh , the blues ?
well , the blues look ...
blue .
green and gray , the gaping maw of the ocean .
it &apos;s mesmerizing .
i don &apos;t know why the hell i &apos;m doing this .
this painting should be hanging in boston .
no , i know .
my man in the port of dubai
says payment was sent last week .
the painting will be in hand well before the wedding .
yes .
hakim , remember me to your wives -- all of them .
what is it ?
it &apos;s about agent keen and her husband .
when this all started ,
when reddington turned himself in and asked for you ,
i was skeptical , suspicious .
but i &apos;ll be honest . you &apos;ve done good work .
and i &apos;ve come to believe that you were just as surprised
as the rest of us when he picked you .
but now this .
i need you to help me understand what &apos;s going on here .
the gun , the money , and passports were in my house .
a hatch in the floor .
the gun was used in an unsolved homicide .
yes .
you pulled a ballistics report .
tom is my husband .
i brought him here , to you , for help , to find answers .
i want to know who killed that fsb agent as much --
more than you do .
if we can solve that murder --
we &apos;re not gonna do anything .
until this matter is resolved , i &apos;m putting you on leave .
what ?
no . tom is here .
agent keen ...
go home .
oh , thank you very much .
meera malik .
tom keen .
but , uh , you probably already know that .
look , i @-@ i came here voluntarily , so ...
where should we start ?
i just want to know the truth .
tell me about the murder .
people think it matters who occupies that house .
it doesn &apos;t .
multinational corporations and criminals run the world .
i thought we were here to talk about tom .
you &apos;ve obviously heard of corporate espionage --
companies trying to beat other companies to be the first hand on the dollar .
but what if it were taken a few steps further ?
in 1982 , seven people in chicago were killed
by an over @-@ the @-@ counter drug laced with potassium cyanide .
the company &apos;s market share went from 35 to 8 .
it was never determined how the drug was poisoned ,
but i will tell you someone was hired to do that .
remember those tire recalls , chernobyl ?
deliberate and malevolent actions taken by corporations
to protect their vital interests .
nothing happens by chance .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here , lizzy .
because there &apos;s a woman --
gina zanetakos .
i don &apos;t know who that is .
gina zanetakos is a corporate terrorist .
and frankly , she &apos;s the best of the bunch .
lizzy , if you want to find the truth about your husband ,
then you need to find gina .
why ? does she know tom ?
because she &apos;s tom &apos;s lover .
i fail to see how suspicions about her husband
affect our arrangement .
agent keen is on leave .
well , then , lives will be lost .
what if i were to deliver to you a terrorist ,
not your run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill ideologue
answering to bearded men in caves ,
but someone entirely different --
less predictable and far more dangerous .
i &apos;d say delivering criminals to me is your job .
my job is my business , harold .
delivering criminals to you is a hobby , a diversion ,
one that may become tiresome ,
in which case we could always reminisce
about that unfortunate incident in kuwait .
are you threatening me , red ?
i am .
hardly the time to let morals stand in the way
of your upward mobility , agent cooper .
i had a job interview . i am a teacher .
fourth grade .
i got a call from the rothwell school in cambridge .
who called you ?
uh , walter -- walter burris .
he &apos;s the headmaster .
he said he saw my application and , uh , he was impressed
and would i mind coming in for a meeting .
lizzy and i decided to make a weekend of it ,
so we got a room at the tellamy cove inn .
we got in friday night .
we had dinner at the restaurant next door ,
which you can verify , because i used my credit card .
and then the next day ,
i met with burris at the angel station hotel .
not the school .
no , he called me that morning ,
and he said he was already downtown on some other business ,
and would i mind meeting him at the hotel .
it &apos;s bad luck , right ?
excuse me ?
your meeting gets changed
to the exact location a man is assassinated .
what would you call it ?
yesterday , i would have called it a coincidence .
look , i don &apos;t belong here .
just call walter burris , okay ?
he &apos;ll verify everything i &apos;m telling you .
where are we on the contents of the box ?
still working on those passports and tracing the money ,
but ballistics did confirm
that it was the gun used to kill victor fokin .
the good news -- we actually did find
a partial on one of the casings in the magazine .
but it &apos;s not tom keen &apos;s ,
and there were no hits on it through afis .
give me updates as soon as you have them .
meanwhile , there &apos;s been a development .
reddington &apos;s brought us a case .
it &apos;s about time he realizes that he has to talk directly to us .
he won &apos;t .
sir , i think it &apos;s entirely inappropriate
that keen is on the case
when her husband &apos;s being investigated for murder .
there &apos;s been a change of plans .
according to reddington , her real name is gina zanetakos .
nearly a year ago ,
she reached out to him as shubie hartwell .
she wanted red to broker a deal to assassinate
a supreme court judge who was the swing vote
in a case that could have cost her corporate clients billions .
custom documents indicate
shubie hartwell entered the country yesterday .
we &apos;ve got a credit card in her name
that was last used under an hour ago .
purchased two cocktails at the bar in the quay hotel .
call the hotel manager .
have him start pulling security tape .
see who she was having drinks with .
agent keen ?
i feel like ... i &apos;ve seen her before .
show me .
come on . i already told you i have it .
i have to pick up my son from piano in an hour .
i &apos;ll show you mine if you show me yours .
got confirmation yesterday .
on its way . it &apos;s official .
it &apos;s official .
what the ... ?
too much ?
be careful . no , be careful .
if melinda sees any more marks on my neck ,
she &apos;s ... gonna ...
gonna what ?
mr. burris , thank you again for meeting with me .
tell me , is this the man you interviewed
for a position here at rothwell ?
did the two of you meet in the coffee shop
of the angel station hotel ?
meera , it &apos;s liz .
give me a call as soon as you speak with the headmaster .
i &apos;d like to know how things are going .
she &apos;s not calling you back .
this is the door ? i &apos;ll take the key .
step back , please .
she shouldn &apos;t even have told you what she told you .
and why is that ?
because you could be an accessory for all we know .
fbi .
check him .
clear . i &apos;m headed down to security .
call an ambulance .
girls , come on .
hold on , hold on !
come on . everybody in .
wait up !
christina , come on . move your can , please .
mobilize d.c. metro .
have teams lock down the quay hotel and a two @-@ block radius .
no , no , no .
i &apos;m headed down to the security desk now to pull footage .
it &apos;s gonna be room 1232 .
and make sure that ambulance shows up now .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
gina ?
hardly .
ressler ? why do you have her phone ?
wh-- did you find her ? did you stop her ?
not exactly .
okay , we &apos;re working on a current address for zanetakos .
her phone provided a treasure trove of messages .
she was in frequent contact
with a multinational company called the hanar group .
but more worrisome
is a message that came in today around three hours ago --
a call that originated from berlin .
change of plans .
had to use cobalt 60 .
still good to go . best guess --
4 : 00 p.m. central .
cobalt 60 ?
they &apos;re talking about a dirty bomb here .
but what &apos;s the target ?
we believe zanetakos is planning to detonate a dirty bomb
somewhere in the central time zone of the united states .
why would she want to do that , lizzy ?
somebody hired this woman .
she killed a man today -- nadeem idris .
he was an attache at the turkish embassy .
looks like they were having an affair .
we suspect it was a means to an end .
have you found the connection to your husband ?
we have looked through all of zanetakos &apos; phone messages ,
all her records .
there wasn &apos;t a single message from tom .
perhaps they exchanged letters .
there &apos;s nothing between them .
my husband is innocent .
did you talk to burris ?
please take a seat .
he backed me up , though , right ?
okay , who is this ?
you don &apos;t know ?
no .
that &apos;s walter burris ,
the headmaster at the rothwell school .
w @-@ w @-@ what is this , some kind of trick ?
did this guy say he met with me ?
because i didn &apos;t meet with him .
and if he says that he met with me ,
then he &apos;s lying . he is lying to you .
because i &apos;ve never seen this guy before in my life , not once .
he &apos;s being set up .
look , uh , i met with a man who --
who claimed to be walter burris .
for 45 minutes , he interviewed me .
look , is lizzy back there ?
i need you to stay seated .
look , i didn &apos;t do anything , okay ?
you have to believe me .
all i did was walk out of a hotel ,
and someone took a picture , okay ?
someone is doing this to me !
the picture .
look , i @-@ i don &apos;t know what you think i did
or who you think i ...
fbi !
clear !
ressler .
victor fokin , the fsb agent .
she was watching him .
so she could kill him , not tom .
she &apos;s an assassin .
guys , you might want to check this out .
found this by her bed .
give us a minute .
this is evidence .
listen , keen , whatever you think this may mean ,
i admire what you &apos;re doing , standing up for your husband ,
but ... i think we both know
it &apos;s time for you to protect yourself .
i didn &apos;t know where else to go .
we found a picture of tom in her house .
he said he doesn &apos;t know her , but clearly he does .
so much is happening ,
and i just don &apos;t know how to process it all .
i mean , a part of me thinks
that you &apos;re manipulating this whole thing
and you &apos;re trying to ruin my life .
but that &apos;s just a part of ...
but if i &apos;m wrong about tom ...
if he isn &apos;t who ...
i don &apos;t think i can handle any of it without him .
i feel like i &apos;m drowning ,
like i don &apos;t know what &apos;s real or who i can trust .
you can trust me .
i needed you to be wrong about him .
your husband may have been connected to our primary suspect .
if i let you into the field and you discover
some incriminating information on him ,
i have no reason to believe you won &apos;t suppress it .
but circumstances require your continued involvement .
we found something on zanetakos &apos; hard drive --
money she wired to a dummy corp in berlin .
interpol says the funds are linked
to a man named maxwell ruddiger ,
a bomb expert operating out of europe .
and you need me because you need red to find this guy .
ruddiger &apos;s our best connection ,
not only to zanetakos , but your husband .
find him .
no . hakim , that is not the problem .
listen to me . shipping is my business .
once i receive payment , the merchandise ships .
that &apos;s the deal .
according to my man in houston , the payment &apos;s not there .
it &apos;s been diverted to new orleans ,
which is entirely unacceptable .
well , i don &apos;t care if the wedding is saturday .
all i care about is my payment .
hakim , this conversation is over .
hello , lizzy .
what can i do for you ?
maxwell ruddiger . tremendous bomb maker .
haphazard as hell , terrible drinker ,
but he gets the job done .
zanetakos made a wire payment to him a few weeks ago .
so he &apos;s the link .
ruddiger can get you to zanetakos ,
and she &apos;ll get you to tom .
can you help me find him ?
i hear you &apos;re using cobalt 60 in the device ,
and you know as well as i
there &apos;s only one reputable supplier on the market ,
and that &apos;s our friend yuri .
now , i like yuri .
i floated in the dead sea with yuri ,
climbed masada with his wife .
but if your device goes off , they &apos;ll be looking to him .
and if they look to him ...
they &apos;ll look to me .
because yuri talks faster than a cheerleader
after a nooner under the grandstands .
probably not a metaphor you understand .
but you do understand my position .
so ...
i need your help , max .
i need to know about this device you &apos;ve made for gina .
red , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t .
just like i wouldn &apos;t do the betray to you ,
i can &apos;t do that to her .
that &apos;s unfortunate .
i &apos;m in the middle of negotiating something very interesting ,
something unique in syria .
i &apos;ll be playing all sides .
i thought there might be a place for you at the table .
another day .
i know that you &apos;re in there .
i know you &apos;re in there .
i know you &apos;re watching , and i didn &apos;t do anything .
lizzy ...
honey , please . i didn &apos;t do anything .
it &apos;s a sedan .
the car is the bomb .
contamination radius of over five miles .
when will it detonate ?
19 hours .
don &apos;t know where .
then we &apos;ll have to ask gina .
call her .
i just need to know where she is .
this will never come back on you .
i know you want to get your hands around her neck .
but when you do , don &apos;t kill her .
kill her ? i want to talk to her .
all right , let &apos;s go . huddle up .
all right , let &apos;s make this quick and clean .
once you get a visual i.d. on zanetakos , call it .
we &apos;ll move in . we &apos;ll take her .
no shots fired .
let &apos;s not make the 6 : 00 news , all right ?
she &apos;s moving north .
copy that . all units converge on my go .
i &apos;ve got her . east green , moving .
she &apos;s making a break for it .
keen , talk to me .
no ! call medevac !
we need someone in here now .
don &apos;t die .
what the hell did you do ?
excuse me ?
calm down .
don &apos;t tell me to calm down !
agent keen
that woman was the link !
she was the only proof that my husband is innocent !
and now she &apos;s what ? dying ?
lying unconscious in some hospital ?
she &apos;s in surgery .
have we forgotten that there &apos;s a bomb out there ?
i haven &apos;t forgotten anything . i &apos;ve been here for seven years .
you &apos;ve been here for seven weeks .
we have less than four hours .
you think we don &apos;t know that ?
what , is zanetakos gonna come out of surgery by then ?
because that was the only lead we have !
i told you to calm down .
the bomb -- what do you know ?
we know what you know .
it &apos;s built into a car , german @-@ made . it &apos;s dirty .
well , do you know why zanetakos killed nadeem idris in that hotel
or how the hanar group is connected ,
who their enemies are ?
the investors .
what do you mean investors ?
the company stock is at an all @-@ time low .
they &apos;re in trouble ,
dragged down by a 48 % drop in the market share
of their largest division .
what division ?
shipping . they operate a port in new orleans .
new orleans -- what do you know about it ?
quite a lot . what do you have in mind ?
you were on the phone .
that guy -- someone was getting married . you were talking
something about new orleans and the ports .
yes .
you told the man on the phone your payment was diverted . why ?
it happens every once in a while , but this was unprecedented .
an associate of mine in new orleans
was advising illicit traffic in the gulf
to be rerouted to new orleans .
the hanar group hired zanetakos .
they &apos;re a majority owner of a port in new orleans .
where was your payment diverted from ?
houston .
that &apos;s the target .
new orleans and houston are the two biggest ports in the gulf .
if houston were to close ...
because of radioactive contamination .
all traffic would have to be diverted to new orleans .
hanar &apos;s profits would soar .
they &apos;d be the only game in the gulf .
that &apos;s my girl .
the port of houston .
you need to halt all cargo traffic headed there right now .
that &apos;s the destination .
the hanar group hired zanetakos to bomb the port .
it could be anywhere .
your girlfriend &apos;s been shot .
what are you talking about ? liz ?
her -- gina zanetakos . - who ?
the one who helped you kill fokin .
i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
what do you know about the bomb ?
what do you know about the ship ?
what ship ? ! i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
how about a manifest , a crate number ?
help me , tom !
why don &apos;t you help me ? because i didn &apos;t do anything .
i don &apos;t know who this woman is .
i don &apos;t know anything about a bomb or a boat .
i don &apos;t know why there was a gun in my house
or money or passports .
all i know about is this . you think i faked this ?
you think i invited a psychopath
into my house to gut me ?
this is real .
in less than an hour , a bomb is gonna go off ,
and people are gonna die .
we &apos;ve been through five sections and found nothing .
this port is 25 miles long .
it will take us weeks to inspect it all .
we &apos;ve got less than an hour .
we &apos;re missing something .
the hanar group -- they hire zanetakos .
she contracted ruddiger to build a bomb . but ...
something &apos;s missing .
nadeem idris .
what ships have been in or out of here in the last week from turkey ?
none .
why would zanetakos need
a low @-@ level turkish diplomat
to get a car bomb into the country ?
because it &apos;s illegal to search diplomatic cargo .
with his help ,
zanetakos was able to get the car in without inspection .
it &apos;s on one of these ships .
check the manifests for all incoming ships
for any items signed by nadeem idris .
security , check all the shipping logs .
it &apos;s re @-@ fabricated .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
the bomb &apos;s not just inside the car .
it is the car .
well , we &apos;ve got minutes here .
what we &apos;ve got is a big @-@ ass problem .
there &apos;s over 2,000 people who work in this harbor .
it will take hours to evacuate .
we &apos;ve only got 10 minutes .
can i explain something ? this thing is radiological .
when it detonates ,
it will go airborne ,
and everything within a five @-@ mile radius will be contaminated .
my suggestion is you take the last 10 minutes
and get the hell out of here .
what if we put it in the water ?
the radiation can be contained underwater .
how do we get this off the ship ?
we crane it off .
this isn &apos;t gonna work .
it &apos;ll work .
it &apos;s not gonna work . we got less than a minute .
we &apos;re running out of time .
move ! come on . get out .
because there was no airborne exposure ,
the nrc is saying that contamination was contained ,
which is the only reason
why the u.s. attorney is considering a plea agreement
in exchange for your cooperation --
your full cooperation . is that clear ?
yes .
your prints are on a nine @-@ millimeter
used to assassinate victor fokin in boston last june .
did you kill him ?
yes .
why ?
someone didn &apos;t want him to talk .
go on .
he was a russian agent defecting to the u.s.
somebody didn &apos;t want him spilling secrets .
what secrets ?
fokin had information
about the route chechen guerrillas were using
to move their supplies to their soldiers on the russian border .
the guy who hired me was making millions providing those supplies .
his name is raymond reddington .
do you know tom keen ?
we found this picture of him in your apartment .
never seen him before .
tom ?
that &apos;s him --
who i met with .
that &apos;s the guy who interviewed me for the job .
please do come in .
you and i -- we &apos;re done .
i heard about tom .
yeah . zanetakos confessed .
or took the fall .
the passports ? forged .
the money in the box ?
traced to an offshore account of yours .
i can only lead you to the truth . i can &apos;t make you believe it .
the truth is that you &apos;re a sick , twisted man .
this , your obsession with me --
you put tom &apos;s picture in zanetakos &apos; apartment .
no .
you hired her to kill victor fokin .
you set my husband up by having your errand boy lure him to boston .
is that what tom said ?
i don &apos;t understand why you would do this , any of it !
go to hell .
oh , the one night you &apos;re on time .
i was really looking forward to the make @-@ up sex .
do you believe he &apos;s innocent ?
it can &apos;t be that simple , right ?
the only thing that &apos;s clear to me
is that he doesn &apos;t work for reddington .
well , then , who the hell does he work for ?
