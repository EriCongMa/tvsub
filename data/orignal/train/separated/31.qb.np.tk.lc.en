dr. princefield to emergency .
dr. princefield to emergency .
dr. forrest , please dial 11 .
this is a delaying tactic , your honor .
she was just contacted this morning .
that &apos;s not a delaying tactic ;
that &apos;s a simple procedural ...
sit down .
okay , let &apos;s begin .
judge robert parks , emergency on @-@ call justice ,
presiding over plaintiff request for declaratory judgment
on medical procedure ...
r @-@ h @-@ l @-@ h @-@ s .
an emergency injunction
preventing nonpayment by insurance company life state .
mr. harper .
uh , your honor , we &apos;re asking for a delay of eight hours .
our lead attorney was caught unaware by this emergency motion .
your honor , this surgery needs to happen now .
life state &apos;s strategy is to run down the clock .
they have no defense ,
so they want to make your ruling irrelevant .
in three days time , my client &apos;s baby could be dead .
objection .
your client &apos;s fetus .
well , thank you , mr. harper .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll all feel much better with that distinction .
this is an emergency court .
you get your attorney in here ,
or you start arguing for yourself .
do you understand ?
i do .
mrs. florrick .
ms. nyholm .
do you mind giving me a hand here , please ?
oh , boy or girl ?
girl .
unlucky you caught judge parks , huh ?
that &apos;s not going to turn out too well , is it ?
why do you say that ?
well , he &apos;s a pro @-@ business constructionist
who never met an insurance company he didn &apos;t like .
isn &apos;t that right ?
yes , it is , little baby .
it is right . eh , pro @-@ business and pro @-@ life .
ah , that &apos;s what you &apos;re hanging your hat on , huh ?
i know a lot of pro @-@ business pro @-@ lifers ,
and somehow business always seems to win the upper hand .
do you mind ?
here we go !
this is an ultrasound of the fetus &apos; heart taken six weeks ago ,
during the 18th week of pregnancy .
you &apos;re referring to my client , mrs. willoughby &apos;s baby ?
yes .
as you can see here ,
the right ventricle is enlarged ,
the left side severely underdeveloped .
it &apos;s hypoplastic left heart syndrome--
a uniformly fatal condition
without in utero surgical intervention .
and this is surgery performed on the baby &apos;s heart--
excuse me ,
the fetus &apos; heart-- while still in the womb ?
yes . it needs to happen by the 24th week , two days from now .
and the surgery is scheduled for ... ?
well , 20 minutes ago .
i had specialists flying in from los angeles ,
miami and boston .
until yesterday ,
when the insurance company pulled the plug ?
objection , your honor . life state did not &quot; pull the plug . &quot;
ms. nyholm , you &apos;re late .
yes , your honor .
mrs. florrick buttonholed me in the parking lot .
fetal surgery is simply not a covered procedure
per the terms of the willoughbys &apos; policy .
this is an experimental treatment .
and we are not in the business , of ...
my apologies , your honor .
i found myself without child care .
and with a handy prop .
excuse me ?
that is cynicism of the ugliest order , counselor .
your honor , i know mr. gardner
hasn &apos;t enjoyed the special bond a mother has
with her child ...
oh , come on .
life state just wanted to put a pretty face
on an ugly stratagem , and ...
mr. gardner , do you have any further questions ?
not at this time , your honor .
ms. nyholm ?
yes , your honor ,
but she really needs to be fed .
this is a stall tactic , your honor .
yes , it &apos;s a stall tactic for me to give my child sustenance .
your honor , we don &apos;t have time
to delay this for even five minutes , let alone ...
she really is very hungry .
if we could just reconvene in an hour ?
ten minutes .
* daily walking close to thee *
* let it be *
* dear lord , let it be ... *
there , that &apos;s when mr. daley stopped me .
he said , &quot; no , reverend , not that one .
&quot; danny boy . &quot;
so , your new boy &apos;s in trouble ?
why do you say that ?
you phoned me .
my guess is , florrick is polling well
everywhere except african @-@ americans .
african @-@ american women .
he &apos;s polling ten points behind last election .
we think it &apos;s about crime .
well , it &apos;s about cheating .
and you want me to help kick off some kind of
forgiveness tour , right ?
prayer breakfast .
a few gracious words about god &apos;s forgiveness ,
peter &apos;s true repentance .
hey , it worked for clinton .
no , no , bill had hillary out there doing press .
uh , it &apos;s not an option .
um , mrs. florrick is a very private person .
look , i like peter .
he &apos;s been good for us .
but the lord in christ church belongs to my son now .
you get his blessing and i &apos;ll happily pray with peter .
it &apos;s just , it &apos;s so bizarre .
we have insurance for exactly this type of thing ,
and now , we could sell off everything and still not cover this .
we &apos;re staying calm , keeping positive .
right .
it was a good day today .
he started kicking again today .
any closer to a name ?
not yet , we ...
we wanna make sure we &apos;re all fine first .
how did you get a judge in here on saturday ?
you didn &apos;t count on that , did you ?
so , this isn &apos;t really your baby , is it ?
what &apos;s her name ?
bite me .
is that dutch ?
excuse me , we &apos;re back in session .
how many times have you performed
this fetal heart surgery procedure , dr. hall ?
i &apos;m not a pediatric cardiologist .
yes , i understand that but that would mean none , right ?
no criticism implied , ma &apos;am ,
i just want to be clear on all the facts .
yes , that &apos;s correct .
in fact , how many times has fetal surgery for hypoplastic
left heart syndrome been attempted in illinois , do you know ?
i must confess i don &apos;t .
four times .
now , dr. hall , how is that not an experimental procedure ?
objection . it &apos;s not within her expertise .
sustained .
i can see why mr. gardner wouldn &apos;t want you to answer that .
no further questions .
ms. nyholm , how long will you need to prepare your defense ?
well , your honor ,
i &apos;m tempted to ask for one week , except ...
24 hours .
except 24 hours is what i mean .
thank you , pastor . um ...
we feel peter needs spiritual guidance .
he &apos;s paid his debt to society ,
but we know that there &apos;s a greater debt .
so , you want to use me .
yes .
why ?
it looks good if i &apos;m embraced by you .
our polling numbers are below par with african @-@ american women .
so , is that the latest scheme , mr. florrick ? brutal honesty ?
son ...
no , wait , it &apos;s okay .
look , reverend , i know that you think i &apos;m just a ...
shallow , narcissistic politician , and you know what ?
i agree with you .
but i have been in prison for the last eight months .
i &apos;ve been away from my family , from my life .
i &apos;ve seen everything i &apos;ve built turn to dust .
until one day you found the glorious words of the gospels .
can we have a minute alone ?
i &apos;m not a photo op .
i know you &apos;re not .
i won &apos;t be charmed , finessed , yupped .
you &apos;ve done wrong .
i know i have .
your marriage is in trouble .
i know you think it isn &apos;t , but it is .
because you don &apos;t acknowledge true repentance .
tell me what i have to do .
you love your wife ?
yes .
does she love you ?
i don &apos;t know .
you are sleeping in separate rooms ?
yeah .
do you believe jesus died for your sins ?
i don &apos;t know what that means .
do you want to know what it means ?
no .
&quot; please , god , make me good , but just not yet . &quot;
you &apos;re afraid of change .
but your wife won &apos;t love you ,
she won &apos;t return to your bed till you change .
so ...
do you want to change ?
nyholm &apos;s not budging .
life state &apos;s worried about setting a precedent
that could cost them millions in the class action .
where are you and cary ?
we &apos;re still working up a list of experimental procedures
life state &apos;s covered in the past .
good . you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i just don &apos;t like investing myself emotionally .
i know .
we have a fighting chance here .
get some sleep .
okay , thanks . bye .
jesus , we pray you to embrace your lost sheep .
guide him back to your flock .
show him your mercy .
let him know that his sins will be forgiven .
merciful jesus , restore to him the joy of your salvation ,
and uphold him by your generous spirit .
even if you don &apos;t sympathize with my clients ...
even if you don &apos;t sympathize with my clients ,
this won &apos;t play well in the press .
oh , come on , will . how bad do you think
you can make an insurance company look these days ?
but we can pay for the operation .
high six figures , right ?
mr. harper can cover that with the stroke of a pen .
if ?
you drop the class action suit .
that &apos;s right , will , let &apos;s talk like adults here .
you &apos;re not in this to help some sweet couple
have their first baby .
where &apos;s the paycheck in that ?
you know , there were 68 other sweet couples
who were denied coverage by life state .
trial lawyers , defenders of the just and the innocent .
just think about it .
drop your class action nuisance suit ,
and we &apos;ll find the money to save that baby .
can you grab my bags , please ?
how &apos;s the life state ?
patti nyholm offered to pay ,
if we drop our class action .
ouch , might as well close up shop .
yep , starting to make sense
why she &apos;s fighting it tooth and nail , though .
you might think about going the political route .
get the state insurance commissioner to apply some pressure .
he won &apos;t get involved ; there &apos;s no political upside .
he might for a friend .
are you ...
no , not me . mr. florrick .
it &apos;s a side benefit of having her on staff , right ?
use her connections .
his connections .
her connection to his connections ?
is that a problem ?
no .
i just think there are better ways to go .
so , good , the reverend &apos;s on board .
yes , he &apos;s seeing peter twice a week ,
and i &apos;ll petition the court for monitored trips
back and forth to the lord in christ church .
and i &apos;ll slip an item to avedon and palish ,
and we &apos;ll get a couple of photographers there .
yeah , you might want to hold off on that .
why ?
peter doesn &apos;t want it .
why ?
pastor isaiah .
what &apos;s going on ?
exactly what we wanted .
spiritual guidance .
what we wanted was a photo op .
yeah , and we &apos;ll get that , eventually .
and in the meantime ?
peter &apos;s listening .
i &apos;m not liking the sound of this .
religion &apos;s like a drug . in small doses , it &apos;s curative .
in large , it &apos;s addictive . talk to him .
he won &apos;t listen to me .
not peter , the reverend isaiah .
pastor isaiah , and i &apos;ll tell you what ,
why don &apos;t you talk to him ?
you &apos;d be better .
eli , aren &apos;t we living in a post @-@ racial world these days ?
okay , i &apos;ll do it .
won &apos;t this be entertaining .
i am incredibly sympathetic .
i can &apos;t even imagine the stress kate must be under .
but a risky , medically @-@ unnecessary surgery
is not the answer .
to be fair , you are a claims manager ,
not a medical professional .
yes , uh ...
but that &apos;s why we hire independent medical consultants ,
uh , retired doctors who are contracted to
evaluate medical records and make a determination .
and what was the consultant &apos;s determination here ?
a fetal surgery is not considered medically necessary
when there is a tried and tested alternative ,
as is waiting until the baby &apos;s born .
no further questions , ms. pomeroy .
i know this was hard for you ,
and your sympathy really goes out to this couple .
so ...
as soon as kate has the baby--
if she has the baby-- you &apos;ll pay for the surgery , correct ?
yes , that &apos;s correct .
it &apos;s covered for a baby that &apos;s born ?
right .
in utero surgery for spina bifida , 23 weeks .
so as far as life state &apos;s concerned ,
this isn &apos;t a baby .
this isn &apos;t someone who qualifies for surgery .
this , according to your denial letter ,
is a pregnancy complication not covered . is that correct ?
objection , relevance .
overruled-- policy language is relevant here .
unfortunately , that &apos;s right .
no further questions .
i &apos;m a new mother myself ,
so i know how exciting and overwhelming it is
and how important it is to guard your health .
ms. nyholm , i get it .
you &apos;re a mom ; we &apos;re all impressed .
can we move this along now ?
yes , your honor .
mrs. willoughby , do you understand the risks of a surgery
that would involve cutting you open to reach your uterus ?
cutting open your baby to insert a balloon catheter
into its heart ?
to save his life .
you forgot that part .
his life , that &apos;s right .
because this is a life we &apos;re talking about .
isn &apos;t it ?
mrs. willoughby , what do you do for a living ?
uh , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m a community organizer .
which involves ?
uh , grass roots efforts towards
social change protecting civil rights .
in fact , you spent the last five years
advocating for abortion rights , didn &apos;t you ?
i lobbied for women &apos;s reproductive rights , in general .
you spent years fighting to ensure that a fetus at this stage
could be aborted legally .
fighting to ensure that there was a choice .
and now that you &apos;re the one with a fetus at 23 weeks ,
you argue that it should be considered a baby ...
in fact , it is a life worth saving ... in fact ,
your baby deserves the most cutting @-@ edge ,
extreme life @-@ saving measures possible .
yes .
this is my child .
of course , he deserves anything .
and you can live with that hypocrisy ?
objection !
badgering the witness .
sustained .
how you doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i &apos;ve been better .
you did well .
they &apos;re worried patti pushed it too far .
it &apos;s hard to read this judge ,
but i think we have a fighting chance .
and if we lose ?
then what ?
what do you mean ?
what are our options ?
let &apos;s not worry about that now .
dr. forrest , dial 113 , please .
dr. forrest , please dial 113 .
we can &apos;t drop our class action .
i know .
there are 68 other couples just like them .
yes , it &apos;s about the firm , too .
but we can &apos;t drop the class action .
i understand .
don &apos;t you like this ?
being a lawyer .
isn &apos;t it fun ?
it has its moments .
i can &apos;t tell which way he &apos;ll rule .
hold on , hold on .
we &apos;re good .
damn it .
your honor , i &apos;m sorry .
i need to raise a quick issue , if you don &apos;t mind .
i &apos;m ready to rule , ms. nyholm .
yes , your honor , but everything about this emergency court
has been rushed and unorthodox ,
and something has been brought to our attention
within the last ten minutes .
what &apos;s she doing ?
quickly , ms. nyholm .
all this litigation has led to a higher level of scrutiny
of the willoughbys &apos; policy application ,
and i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve uncovered some deal @-@ changing issues .
oh , come on .
yes , mr. gardner .
when we began these proceedings ,
i didn &apos;t expect mr. willoughby to misrepresent his medical history .
what ?
sit down , sir . sit down .
this misrepresentation
gives life state the right to rescind his policy entirely .
your honor , this is not a buffet .
ms. nyholm can &apos;t pick one attack and then failing that , try another .
your honor , i would argue that this goes to the heart of contract law .
even if you are prone to rule in the plaintiffs &apos; favor ,
at the very minimum , you should hear
whether there was a legal contract to begin with .
your honor , i want to remind you
that we are racing against a ticking clock .
ms. nyholm is counting on this surgery being irrelevant
by the time you decide .
mr. gardner , urgency is not its own rationale .
a just decision cannot , will not be rushed .
you still have two days for the surgery .
ms. nyholm , prepare your witnesses and your exhibits ,
and i will hear on this matter tomorrow .
you understand what you &apos;re doing here , patti ?
you take away their coverage altogether ,
that baby gets no surgery at all .
that &apos;s on you , will .
you have another option .
drop the class action .
i want to speak to you today about the path , god &apos;s path .
jesus said , &quot; i am the way , the truth and the life &quot; &quot;
when we walk with him , our souls are right with him .
i never realized you rehearsed these sermons .
thought they just came down from the holy spirit , like a dove .
hello , mr. gold .
reverend isaiah .
so , i believe i &apos;ve been crimping your style .
peter did wrong .
he &apos;s sorry .
he apologized to his wife .
he apologized to his constituents .
he would now like to apologize to his god .
and i approve .
no , sir .
reverend , you &apos;re doing more than approving .
you &apos;re trying to take advantage of a man who &apos;s feeling raw
about his mistakes .
i love that word , &quot; mistakes . &quot;
sleeping with a prostitute is just like a dropped zero on a tax form .
you &apos;re young , sir .
youth tends to see things in black and white .
things are black and white .
so , let &apos;s put things into black and white for you , then .
four point two grams of crack cocaine--
you were just short of intent to distribute .
and you want to what ?
tell my congregation ? shock them ?
you &apos;re gonna have to look for something new .
i could give you my license plate number .
reverend , peter could make a difference ... in people &apos;s lives .
he needs to make a difference in his life first .
he has .
no .
i have to go .
i &apos;ve enjoyed this .
let &apos;s stay in touch .
mr. willoughby ,
life state is saying that this question wasn &apos;t answered accurately .
can you see that ?
yes .
you were to check the box if you had circulatory problems ,
including but not limited to chest pain , heart murmur ,
palpitations , phlebitis .
do you know what that is ?
i don &apos;t .
funny , i don &apos;t either . do you ?
objection .
mrs. florrick .
sustained .
mr. willoughby ,
why didn &apos;t you check box number two ?
well , because it says
&quot; circulatory disorders / problems . &quot;
the doctor said the heart palpitations
were nothing to worry about .
they weren &apos;t a problem .
so , i just thought i was being accurate .
thank you .
let &apos;s chalk question two up to a misunderstanding .
but if someone outright lied
on an application regarding a relevant health issue ,
that would be grounds for voiding their policy , correct ?
yes .
but i didn &apos;t .
question 10 .
during the past 12 months ,
has any applicant smoked cigarettes ,
pipes , cigars , or used chewing tobacco ?
you answered no , correct ?
correct .
yes , good .
now , last fall ,
did you go on a fishing trip with a friend ,
with the lovely name of brent boyle ?
objection .
relevance .
i &apos;m getting there .
overruled .
the witness may answer the question .
yes .
yes , you did go on such a fishing trip ?
good .
here .
here &apos;s you .
and ...
here .
looks like you &apos;re smoking a cigarette there .
that was ... it was only one .
i &apos;ve never been a regular smoker .
the question wasn &apos;t whether you were a regular smoker .
yes , but i didn &apos;t think ...
your honor ,
the question was simple .
mr. willoughby &apos;s answer was a lie .
laying aside my sympathy for the plaintiff ,
what this boils down to is a simple matter of contract law .
mr. willoughby &apos;s material omission gives life state
the right to render this contract null and void .
plaintiff &apos;s motion is denied . policy recision stands .
your honor , i would ask for an emergency motion
to reconsider .
sending kate willoughby home without this surgery
is a death sentence for her child .
i &apos;m following the law , mr. gardner .
not agreeing with it .
motion to reconsider denied .
okay , let &apos;s make a deal .
you just lost at craps , will .
you don &apos;t make a deal with the croupier ; you just go home .
well , if i were you , patti , i &apos;d still want to be certain .
oh , come on .
right .
good @-@ bye .
i blew it .
no , jesse blew it , and he knows it .
no , nyholm &apos;s right .
i ...
i played craps with that kid &apos;s life .
will , you did everything .
will , you listen .
i know you did everything .
are we ... ?
damn it .
alicia ...
no , no , no .
damn it .
god .
this is not a good idea .
oh , hi . just , uh , forgot my laptop .
good night .
night .
alicia .
you just missed her .
oh , thanks .
hello ?
mr. gardner ?
please , we need your help .
you all right ?
let &apos;s go to the bedroom .
no , here .
we &apos;re hoping it &apos;s braxton hicks , but they still won &apos;t ...
excuse me ... amanda .
this hospital is required by law to treat patients
in an emergency , regardless of insurance coverage .
we are just sorting out the paperwork , sir .
for an hour ? !
if a doctor is not examining her
within three minutes , i will personally call the police
and file a malpractice suit against you .
personally .
don &apos;t make an enemy out of a lawyer , lady .
that was ... great last night .
are you becoming religious ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m becoming .
but i want to change .
no , really ... change .
must be eli ...
so i better change .
um ... will , you ,
you can &apos;t ...
it &apos;s not about ... it &apos;s about work .
for wor ... what ?
your cell phone &apos;s off .
i just spent all night at the hospital with the willoughbys .
i need to talk to peter .
no .
will ?
hey , peter .
been a long time .
a very long time .
come on in .
good to see you .
you , too , man . yeah .
the surgery &apos;s tomorrow .
we &apos;ve exhausted all legal channels and ...
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
how can i help ?
a company like life state
is motivated by two things-- money
and the fear of a revoked license .
and i know you and the commissioner go back a long way .
hmm . give me something concrete ,
and i &apos;ll make sure he gets his eyes on it right away .
thank you .
so , um ...
how &apos;s alicia doing at work ?
alicia ?
good .
great , really .
i &apos;m sorry about all the late hours .
oh , hey , a lawyer &apos;s life ?
i get it .
anyway ...
i hear the retrial &apos;s going well .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t know .
our state &apos;s attorney seems intent on retrying me ,
no matter how thin the evidence .
well , at least you &apos;re home .
at least i &apos;m home .
so , alicia ,
we need to reconvene this morning with kalinda .
supposedly , she &apos;s got something on life state .
oh , what do you know .
kalinda works at stern lockhart .
small world .
that &apos;s right .
she used to work for you . mm @-@ hmm .
so , i &apos;ll see you later .
yup .
don &apos;t be late .
he &apos;s great .
i don &apos;t remember him being so nice .
yeah .
please tell me you have something good .
well , i &apos;m not sure what it is .
and my method for obtaining it is not exactly legitimate .
illegitimate as in &quot; i can &apos;t use it in court , &quot;
or ... we can go to jail ?
i downloaded firmware
and cloned patti nyholm &apos;s phone ,
in order to intercept her text messages .
what ?
you wanted something . i got you something .
okay , let &apos;s hear it .
well , apart from an alarming flirtation with a guy that mows
the lawn ,
she &apos;s hiding pamela .
pamela . pamela who ?
my guess is pamela pomeroy , that claims manager .
i think she &apos;s ready to flip .
she was on the stand . she didn &apos;t say a thing .
yeah .
&quot; they &apos;re on to pam . they turn pam ,
we lose everything &quot; &quot; my guess is , pomeroy
went one too many times to bat for life state .
she &apos;s ready to spill .
you really cloned nyholm &apos;s cell ?
yeah .
you do that again , don &apos;t tell me .
no problem .
i should talk to her .
mr. gardner ?
yeah ?
did alicia get her laptop last night ?
alicia ?
after you left , she came back looking
for her laptop in your office .
just making sure she got it .
yeah , yeah , she got it .
okay , let &apos;s go see pamela .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry about this morning .
you don &apos;t have to be sorry .
can i come in ?
yeah .
so , you &apos;re my boss .
i know .
i &apos;m a junior associate .
i know .
you came into my office .
last night after you left , you came back to my office-- why ?
will ... help me out , please ?
i mean , we had ...
we had ...
whatever we had at georgetown , and i just ...
but you came back .
i know .
it was wrong .
because you &apos;re married ?
okay , i have a suggestion .
i like work .
i like working here .
i don &apos;t want everywhere i go to be a mess .
we &apos;re not going to talk about this .
we &apos;re not going to say any more , okay ?
good .
we &apos;re going to go to dinner
in one week &apos;s time , and we &apos;ll talk then .
please don &apos;t end up hating me .
i need this job . i mean , i &apos;m ...
i @-@ i , i mean that ...
i &apos;m sorry ...
alicia .
it &apos;s fine .
we have bad timing .
we &apos;ve always had bad timing .
excuse me , ms. pomeroy ?
oh , you &apos;re , uh ...
yes .
do you have a moment , ms. pomeroy ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think we should be talking .
we just need a minute .
why are they trying to hide you ?
i @-@ i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
uh , i have to go .
please !
the willoughbys ...
their child is dying .
i saw it in your eyes . you want to help .
please help .
you saw it in my eyes ?
really ?
what powers of perception .
what do you see in my eyes now ?
i &apos;m going home now .
but ... nyholm said she was trying to hide pam .
you guys are really clueless .
she &apos;s not trying to hide it .
it &apos;s closed already .
&quot; it &quot; ?
it &apos;s an acronym .
pam-- policy application management .
it &apos;s an off @-@ site group
of life state employees who look for application mistakes ,
but only after expensive claims were filed .
it &apos;s organized post @-@ claims underwriting .
yup . it &apos;s illegal in some states ,
and legislation in illinois is on the horizon .
which explains why they shut it and try to bury it .
yeah , but we got it with an illegally @-@ obtained text .
it &apos;s fruit of the poisonous tree . we can &apos;t use it .
we can use it .
we just can &apos;t use it in court .
not a good time .
sure , it is .
suit yourself .
is that ... ?
yeah .
this case is over , will .
no .
life state is going to
quietly reinstate kate &apos;s coverage
in time for the surgery this afternoon ...
or your client &apos;s going to be dealing
with a hell of a lot more than one upset family .
here i go trembling again .
we know about pam .
and do you know who &apos;s sitting outside your office right now ?
jonathan dobbs , the insurance commissioner .
tammy ?
is there a man in the waiting room ?
describe him .
how &apos;d you do that ?
he &apos;s waiting to hear about pam .
an entire department dedicated to finding specious ways
to rescind policies when patients need them most .
do you remember when you asked me
how bad i can make an insurance company look ?
really bad , patti .
drop your license bad .
you got this illegally .
you must have , or we &apos;d be in court .
you want to take it to a judge and sort it out there ,
or just cover kate ?
thank you .
i , um ... i failed her .
just one puff of a cigarette ,
and i saw it all going wrong .
you have kids ?
no .
i think it changes everything .
doesn &apos;t it ?
it does .
is he ... ?
i can &apos;t tell if he &apos;s smiling . is he smiling ?
i don &apos;t know .
take off your mask .
you realize if one whiff of pam surfaces ,
we can trace back to your firm ?
i know what a confidentiality agreement is , patti .
and you can &apos;t use it in the class action suit .
we &apos;ll find another way .
i doubt that .
how &apos;d you find it ?
find what ?
pam .
who &apos;s pam ?
you two make a cute couple .
how &apos;d it go ?
the insurance guys ?
jonathan showed up , right ?
oh , right . yeah , he did .
it worked .
our client got the surgery , and it went well .
all right ...
how was your day ?
good .
i spent more time with pastor isaiah .
he wants us to go to church .
well , that would be interesting .
it &apos;s getting late .
