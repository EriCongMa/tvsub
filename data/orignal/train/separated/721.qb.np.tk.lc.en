i found lyman here
snooping through your black laptop .
i didn &apos;t push him , but i didn &apos;t help him .
you are the only person in my life
that doesn &apos;t keep secrets from me ,
and i owe you the same .
i just saw your wedding ring .
the ring is not exactly what it looks like .
she &apos;s going after my friends to do it ...
first with ben , and now ...
this is a far cry from the margaux i knew last year .
she &apos;s angry that we were forced to lie about daniel &apos;s death .
the daniel grayson research wing .
the board is still struggling with the idea
of naming it after daniel .
i think it &apos;s time we took that step to end this
before she does .
we can clear daniel &apos;s name together .
the only way to end this
is by you telling the world the truth .
the baby ... he &apos;s gone .
why was emily with you ?
she pushed me .
please have these returned
and make sure no other items are delivered .
right away .
and ms. lemarchal &apos;s daily news briefings
are in the kitchen , if she &apos;s up to it .
thank you .
the clothes were beautiful .
you &apos;re up .
i &apos;ll send brigitte out for some breakfast for you .
i can &apos;t eat .
at what time is the groundbreaking gala tomorrow ?
darling .
you don &apos;t have to attend .
all we wanted was to redeem daniel &apos;s name .
the hospital wing is the closest we &apos;ve come ,
and i need to see something good after ...
how can i miss someone i have never met ?
you &apos;re a mother ,
and emily should be behind bars
for taking that away from you .
pushing you in front of that car was attempted murder .
and i intend to share that with the prosecutor &apos;s office .
no , victoria , i ...
let &apos;s focus on our family .
no prosecutors .
too much blood has been shed .
none of it is on your hands .
if only that were true .
i was so desperate to expose emily &apos;s secrets .
i had lyman ellis steal what he could
off of nolan &apos;s hard drive .
before he could deliver it ...
he was found dead ...
on my devil &apos;s errand .
i should have listened to you weeks ago and ended my revenge .
get some rest .
yeah .
paper delivery .
three days in a row .
you don &apos;t have to keep checking in on me .
am i that obvious ?
well , i already poured you a cup of coffee ,
so , yeah , i &apos;d say pretty obvious .
you doing okay today ?
still wish that i could reach out to margaux .
but i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t even know what i would say .
at least the groundbreaking for daniel &apos;s wing is tomorrow ,
so hopefully that will bring her a little solace .
well , it &apos;s you that i &apos;m worried about at the moment .
i &apos;m trying to keep my mind off it .
really ? how ?
mr. clarke . good morning .
sorry , the , uh , alarm didn &apos;t go off .
job interview ?
ben made detective .
yeah , first day driving the crown vic .
oh . well , congratulations are in order .
thanks .
all right , i &apos;m gonna take my coffee to go .
i &apos;m repairing the rigging today . it &apos;s an all @-@ day job .
same time tomorrow ?
you look great .
you have time for some breakfast ?
you know , i should probably get going , too .
before i forget , my brother just texted me ,
and he &apos;s coming in for this promotion party
the guys are throwing me tomorrow .
and maybe to meet this hot girl that i &apos;ve been seeing .
oh , really ? who &apos;s the girl ?
you don &apos;t know her .
i &apos;ll see you later .
where is the cinnamon ?
i can &apos;t make nanny hettie &apos;s french toast without cinnamon .
louise ?
oh . i came back early .
you have not seen family drama
until you &apos;ve been to an ellis funeral .
it was horrible .
i ate my weight in grits in three days .
oh , see , i knew it . i should have gone with you .
seeing lyman in that coffin just ... gutted me .
and hearing mama in front of all the rest of those liars and cheats
delivering a eulogy worthy of margaret mitchell just ...
it just made me ill .
the only lie i told myself was that i could handle it alone .
well , you &apos;re ... you &apos;re home now .
it &apos;s okay .
what can i get you ?
well , two things .
first , i really need one of our wonder twin nights .
they &apos;re so much better than three xanax and a glass of rose .
well , that is high praise .
what else ?
i want a baby .
we could adopt one .
well , w @-@ we say we &apos;re like family ,
so why don &apos;t we just be one ?
we can raise a great kid
in an open , honest marriage
and make up for the mistakes our parents made with us .
what do you think ?
i @-@ i &apos;m ...
i @-@ i &apos;m just ...
still trying to decide what we should do tonight , so ...
i know .
i know . i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s too much too soon .
i get it .
will you at least think about it ? please ?
i think you all understand the gravity of this matter .
well , i &apos;ve seen these .
and they should have no bearing on tomorrow &apos;s gala .
the board &apos;s decision
to name the new research wing in your son &apos;s honor
was predicated on our ability to manage the publicity .
well , silly me .
and i thought it was predicated on my $ 40 million donation .
women &apos;s groups say we &apos;re rewarding a violent man .
high @-@ profile researchers are pulling out .
the board had no choice .
there won &apos;t be a daniel grayson research wing at this hospital .
i have the full support of lemarchal media behind me ,
and i can rebut this trash in two hours ,
since i believe that the events surrounding my son &apos;s death
have been highly exaggerated .
the board isn &apos;t comfortable with this victim @-@ shaming , victoria .
i &apos;m no victim .
i voted in support of the wing
because i have forgiven daniel .
he shouldn &apos;t be judged for the last 15 minutes of his life .
i move to reconsider .
you &apos;ve been gracious enough , ms. thorne ,
but i &apos;m afraid this matter &apos;s settled .
you realize this means
i &apos;ll have to rescind my donation , alexander .
in light of the board &apos;s new stance ,
we &apos;ve found other funding .
so the groundbreaking is still tomorrow .
this meeting is adjourned .
well , you &apos;re right ... you &apos;re no victim .
daniel &apos;s a victim . margaux &apos;s a victim .
they both needed this .
don &apos;t start .
i voted for the wing , and i just tried to save it .
you should have told the truth about daniel .
that was a decision we all made together .
i didn &apos;t want this .
feel free to delude yourself .
but one thing i know
is that you have the blood of my son
and my grandchild on your hands .
第四季 第十八集
the daycare center is coming together nicely .
it is . and we &apos;ll open as soon as we pass inspection .
and honestly , tony ,
scheduling that has been a red @-@ tape nightmare .
well , seven years in social services have taught me
that the wheels of government
don &apos;t turn without a nudge or two .
i &apos;ll call .
oh , well , then , my employees , members ,
and their soon @-@ to @-@ be very well @-@ cared @-@ for children
thank you .
well , maybe you can show me how much .
come out with me tonight .
i can &apos;t make up any more excuses to drop by .
some friends of mine are getting together ...
just some drinks and good music on the beach .
nothing like the bashes i &apos;ve heard that you &apos;re famous for ,
but you might enjoy yourself , anyway .
i think i might .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;d have to just make sure that i &apos;m free .
well , my advice ... be free .
looks like my social worker made quite an impression .
is it that obvious ?
how does louise feel about splitting time with tony ?
fine .
i guess .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s splitting time with tony .
jack , the truth is ...
i don &apos;t know how she &apos;d react .
she &apos;s been so fragile lately .
and , honestly , it just seems like
things are getting more complicated every day .
look , i can tell you firsthand that it sucks to find out
that you &apos;ve been kept in the dark .
and if she really is as fragile as you &apos;re saying ,
then lying to her is only gonna make it worse .
all right , well , speaking of ems ...
nice try . we &apos;re on you .
talk to your wife .
so , now that you &apos;re a big @-@ shot detective ,
maybe you can find that 80 bucks you owe me .
can &apos;t solve &apos; em all , willard .
certainly not at this pace .
victoria grayson .
i don &apos;t believe i &apos;ve officially had the pleasure .
well , it &apos;s only because you left me waiting for over 30 minutes
while you walked down memory lane .
there someone or something that i can help you find ?
like that sign out there that says &quot; men only &quot; ?
why don &apos;t you ask your girlfriend
how well i respond to sarcasm ?
or maybe i should ask your police chief
what he thinks about his newest detective
dating a woman who should be behind bars for fraud ,
among other things .
and that you gave her a big assist .
help me now ,
or your promotion will be a blip of a memory .
bye , boys .
i have to clear daniel &apos;s name .
there &apos;ll be press at the gala tomorrow .
i &apos;ll do it there .
you don &apos;t owe victoria anything .
this has nothing to do with victoria .
her words mean nothing to me .
but margaux was reacting to our lie .
she lost her baby .
i have to make it right .
listen , you have to stop blaming yourself , amanda .
it was an accident .
you didn &apos;t know margaux before all of this .
daniel &apos;s death changed her .
she &apos;s trying to salvage the name of someone that she loves ,
just like i did for you .
you asked me to leave revenge behind .
this is what it looks like , dad .
so , what &apos;s with this desperate ploy
to see the lyman ellis file ?
lyman was my friend and attorney .
and we both know about this precinct &apos;s ,
shall we say , subjective police reporting .
i wanted to make sure the case was closed properly .
yeah , well , it was . closed it myself .
louise was the last person to see him alive .
my heart breaks for her .
all that was found on lyman were his personal effects ...
his wallet , watch , kerchief ?
nothing more ?
look , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re up to ,
but it &apos;s damn sure not about making sure
that i closed my case properly .
if i &apos;m right , this has something to do with emily ,
which means you &apos;re gonna have me to deal with , too .
oh . drawing dramatic conclusions from mere conjecture .
maybe this new job isn &apos;t right for you , after all .
how can i go with you to the groundbreaking ?
i know you have ben &apos;s promotion party .
some of the rookies still talk to me .
i can do both .
all right , so , what would the new story be ?
malcolm broke into my house and tried to kill me .
daniel jumped in front of the bullet ,
and malcolm fled .
the story is clean , except for one thing .
you need me to recant my statement
that you called me about daniel &apos;s attack .
you can tell them that i asked you to lie
because i was afraid malcolm would come after me again ,
which he did .
i know it &apos;s a lot to ask .
things between us have been ...
awkward ?
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i thought we put all this to bed already .
i ...
i killed someone .
and i will protect you .
jack , i wouldn &apos;t ask you this
if i wasn &apos;t absolutely sure that i could .
i got to think about it .
i don &apos;t .
over my dead body .
i see how you work , emily .
excuse me ?
i know you brought me to town last year as a pawn
in your vendetta against the graysons .
i risked my sobriety to help .
you clearly manipulated me .
i draw the line at my son .
mom !
i have always protected jack .
really ?
he almost lost custody of carl because of you .
he almost lost carl because of a decision
that we all made together ... we didn &apos;t have a choice .
all right , enough !
you are a train wreck , emily .
jack will not be your collateral damage again .
i take responsibility for the things i &apos;ve done ,
but i was not alone in this .
if i have anything to say , you will be alone going forward .
it &apos;s been years since i had a homemade lemon tart .
it &apos;s been just as long since i &apos;ve made one .
but you were so good to me after daniel &apos;s passing
that i thought i &apos;d return the kindness
when i heard about lyman .
you &apos;re very sweet .
but you have a lot on your plate yourself .
i read that article . the media can be cruel .
yes , well , i &apos;ll handle the press ,
and i &apos;ll defend daniel until the day i die .
you never turn your back on your children .
after daniel died ,
all these memories came flooding back
every time i saw a picture or heard an old voicemail ...
or handled his belongings .
i can help you with lyman &apos;s things
if you need me to .
i didn &apos;t think you were here for my darjeeling .
you &apos;re here for the very same reason
that my late brother was ,
and that is to hurt nolan with that flash drive .
i am here because i care about you .
take your things and leave my home right now .
i can &apos;t believe i almost fell for your sympathy .
you &apos;re trusting the wrong people .
nolan hasn &apos;t told you everything .
nolan and i have no secrets .
did he tell you what happened the night daniel died ?
the people to whom you &apos;ve pledged your loyalty
have two faces ,
and you ...
you &apos;ve got a good heart .
don &apos;t let them break it .
you were unfair to emily .
she &apos;s been unfair to you over and over .
clearing daniel &apos;s name isn &apos;t just about
you helping a friend .
there are legal ramifications .
i was a cop . i know that .
then let &apos;s play this out .
you corroborate emily &apos;s story .
police could start kicking over cans ,
and you go down
for obstruction of justice and murder ,
which is a capital offense .
and she was an fbi agent .
who was pointing a gun at me .
exactly what you should have said that night .
the self @-@ defense ship has sailed .
what about carl ?
carl &apos;s a reason to come clean .
margaux came after us because of the lie about daniel .
this is my mess , too .
the only reason you &apos;re even considering this
is because of @-@ of how you feel about her .
does she know ?
she knows .
i &apos;m past that .
positive ?
you come from two alcoholic parents .
make sure emily &apos;s not your glass of scotch .
you do know that ,
breaking the open @-@ container law ,
it &apos;s , it &apos;s a gateway crime .
told you i had a bad side .
and an empty glass .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;m really glad you came .
hi . it &apos;s louise .
leave a message .
hey , louise , sorry , i just missed your call .
you &apos;re probably leaving a message .
i &apos;m swamped at the club , so
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m probably gonna be here pretty late .
you don &apos;t need to wait up .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
before i jump to conclusions , does &quot; swamped at the club &quot;
mean something other than the obvious ?
tony
the thing with louise ...
it &apos;s not a traditional marrige .
then why lie to her ?
this isn &apos;t how i work , nolan .
i won &apos;t be the other man in someone &apos;s marriage .
okay , i just ...
i just need some time to , you know , figure things out .
that &apos;s the thing about being honest , nolan .
you don &apos;t .
you ever figure things out , call me .
right . we are almost there .
no , no , no , no . i &apos;ll do the cooking , baby bro .
last time you manned the grill , we had to order chinese .
you &apos;re just never gonna let me forget that .
it ranks right up there
with the time you taught yourself the art of kissing .
really , kev ? in front of the girl ?
cease and desist .
no , no , no . i need dirt on you .
kevin , spill .
no .
i think i &apos;m gonna keep my best stuff
for ben &apos;s big party tomorrow night .
yeah , well , i can &apos;t wait for that .
what about you , emily ?
you have an annoying brother like me ?
no , i &apos;m a ... i &apos;m an only child , actually .
i bet you had your dad wrapped around your finger ,
just like my little girl does .
we &apos;re close .
i mean ...
we were close .
i ...
i lost my parents when i was young .
they died in a car crash .
i &apos;m , ...
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
tell you what , why don &apos;t you let me handle the talking ?
you stick to what you know and go check that grill .
sorry . i &apos;ll get that .
jack .
you &apos;ve got company .
yeah . it &apos;s fine . come in .
you talk to your mom ?
and you &apos;re not gonna help me .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just too risky .
the cops are gonna turn your story over and over
looking for holes .
and i will have answers for them .
i &apos;ve gotten away with bigger things than this .
no one knows that better than me .
if you don &apos;t back my story , the plan is dead .
then it &apos;s dead .
i got to think about carl and ...
and you .
i &apos;m not doing anything
to put the people that i love in jeopardy .
ready to put the burgers on .
hey , man .
hey .
jack , this is kevin , ben &apos;s brother .
porter .
i &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
well , i @-@ i don &apos;t mean to interrupt .
i just need to know how emily takes hers .
rare .
the bluer , the better .
let it go , ems .
you wanna tell me about last night ?
what was going one at the beach club ?
it turned out it was nothing , so ...
okay .
&apos;cause there &apos;s absolute no reason for you to go into work
before the sun is comfortable in the sky .
stay !
let &apos;s watch trashy tv and get day @-@ drunk
and finish our talk .
well , that does sound indulgent , but ,
duty calls , so ...
well , i guess i &apos;ll just keep reading gossip rags all day .
you know , i can &apos;t believe
how many articles are still trashing daniel .
it &apos;s so hard for me to imagine him attacking emily like that .
you didn &apos;t know him for that long .
i guess .
but i just met you , and i know you .
which is exactly what i told victoria
when she dropped in yesterday .
she was here ?
she came to pay her respects ,
but of course , five minutes in , she spun it into her usual vitriol ,
so i threw her out .
you know , when we get the baby , we should install a gate
to keep the hyenas from dropping in
with store @-@ bought lemon tart .
i @-@ i know you &apos;re still thinking about the baby .
i am .
and , uh , i &apos;m about to be late ,
so ...
call me later ?
yeah , of course .
跟当地普通人共处
sorry to intrude , but you haven &apos;t been returning my calls .
i finally made progress in the white gold matter .
with all that &apos;s happened , i had forgotten about my inquiry .
she sent word through one of her associates .
she is stateside
and has agreed to take care of your emily thorne problem .
don &apos;t pursue it any further .
with all due respect ,
don &apos;t let what just happened to you cloud your judgment .
l &apos;arreter tu maintenant ... i don &apos;t want emily hurt .
the wheels are in motion .
i already transferred the money
to the designated cayman account ,
and her point person has gone dark .
we have no way to reach her .
no , you have no way to reach her .
if you ever question my judgment again ,
i &apos;ll make sure she finds you next .
you &apos;re here early .
well , uh , my beach body
couldn &apos;t survive another southern @-@ fried breakfast , and ...
wait , what &apos;s up ?
i know you &apos;re not here to reserve a primo cabana , so ...
i asked jack to help me clear daniel &apos;s name .
he said no .
whoa . whoa , whoa , whoa . slow down .
why would you want to open that can of grayson worms ?
for margaux ?
&apos;cause of the baby ?
ems , i know you feel bad , but jack was right .
do you know what could happen ?
you &apos;d think after four years ,
you guys would have a little faith that i do .
look , i just need to erase jack from the narrative .
can you help me ?
look , i have many skills ,
but i can &apos;t manipulate what people have heard ... yet .
i know . i just ... thought it would inspire something .
yeah , like abandoning this crazy idea .
nolan , i have to do something good .
i @-@ i mean this in the best possible way , but ...
emily thorne was not built for good .
she was built to clear her dad &apos;s name ,
which she did -- brilliantly .
so there &apos;s nothing you can do ?
yeah ... i can tell you
to enjoy the perks of being a beloved socialite
who &apos;s earned them .
david .
stevie .
that &apos;s a nice surprise .
we need to talk about emily .
yeah .
you know what , you were right the other day
when you told me she &apos;d come around .
things between us are better .
oh . great for the two of you .
but keep her away from jack .
where &apos;s that coming from ?
she has a temp to change her story to clear daniel &apos;s name .
i talked him out of it , but what about the next time
when she ask to do something reckless ?
emily wanted to do the right thing .
you knew ?
yeah .
she suddenly gets conscientious and jack supposed to hop to ?
did you really think
that ill @-@ conceived plan was a good idea ?
no , i didn &apos;t , but emily &apos;s been on her own a long time .
i don &apos;t have a right to force my way .
you have every right . you &apos;re her father .
don &apos;t shirk your responsibilities
because you feel guilty about her childhood .
you &apos;re out of line .
you don &apos;t know a thing about our relationship .
i know enough !
stop fixing this damn boat
and take responsibility for the fire you lit 20 years ago !
conrad framed you for flight 197,
but you slept with his wife first .
your bad choices knocked over the first domino .
i got work to do .
so that &apos;s it ?
yeah , that &apos;s it .
we &apos;ve both made mistakes ,
but you don &apos;t have a right to crucify me for mine .
that &apos;s the end of the conversation .
ow ! oh ! david !
emily wanted to redeem grayson .
these really must be the end times .
well , thank the revenge gods you said no ,
&apos;cause there could have been major fallout for both of you .
i know .
you want to know the truth ?
i almost said yes when she asked me .
i know , jack .
and on top of it , daniel saved emily &apos;s life ,
and we destroyed his reputation .
and i still don &apos;t know what &apos;s best for carl
&apos;cause emily &apos;s plan could land me in jail .
but the cover @-@ up about daniel almost did the same thing .
okay , jack .
don &apos;t let sleeping lies dog you .
there &apos;s some bells that can &apos;t be un @-@ rung ,
like the one that got me to church on time .
you still haven &apos;t talked to louise ?
no .
i mean , what &apos;s the point ?
things were over with tony before they even began ,
and ... louise is too broken right now .
so you stay unhappily married ?
for how long ?
why does she have such a hold over you ?
you remember when i said that she was emotionally fragile ?
yeah .
her brother lyman &apos;s death wasn &apos;t entirely an accident .
she caught him snooping on my laptop .
they got into a fight .
he slipped .
she let him fall to protect me .
i &apos;ve just had this growing knot in my stomach
ever since she told me , and now ...
she wants to have a baby .
like , i want a family and a real marriage one day , but ...
... with somebody stable .
not someone who ...
not someone you pity .
sounds awful .
but ...
yaah .
how did you figure out who i am ?
your cayman account helped .
the lemarchal name carries a lot of weight in the caribbean ,
especially in the black markets .
so once i knew your alias ...
i need to cancel the thorne job .
your associate went to great lengths
to persuade me to take this job ...
and failed .
but when i found out who he was working for ,
how could i say no ?
i love a kick @-@ ass , powerful kind of girl .
i wasn &apos;t myself when i asked him to hire you .
you were the darkest part of yourself .
don &apos;t be ashamed . own it .
oh , i am nothing like you .
you want me to cancel ?
fine .
but i still have one issue ... you know my real identity .
and since my anonymity is important to me ,
you and i have a problem .
if anything happens to me , an e @-@ mail will be sent
outing your real identity to interpol .
you &apos;re threatening me .
you &apos;re risking your life to save your enemy &apos;s ?
i have nothing left to lose but my soul .
and i &apos;m not willing to give that up just yet .
louise ?
louise !
louise !
oh , god .
are you okay ?
you scared me .
i &apos;m a big girl , nolan .
i can swim in the deep end alone .
guess you didn &apos;t have to work late tonight .
no .
thought we could talk .
now , is this about my sudden outbreak of baby fever ?
it is about us .
i think it &apos;s time that we ...
end this marriage .
we got into this to liberate you from your family ,
which we did .
but ...
i mean , i &apos;m just worried that the longer we stay in this ,
the more ... blurred lines are gonna get .
lou @-@ lou , say something .
we both agreed that this would be temporary .
a fun summer of debauchery .
i guess i just ...
got a little carried away with playing house .
i &apos;ll call the lawyers in the morning ,
and ... i &apos;ll be out of here as soon as i can .
there &apos;s no rush .
we &apos;ll always be friends ... forever .
how can we be anything but ?
you &apos;re my knight in versace armor , right ?
and thank you ... for being completely honest with me .
hey , i thought you &apos;d be dressed .
we were gonna get a bite to eat with kevin before the party .
i think i should stay home .
you and i can celebrate together later .
okay , okay , hey , what &apos;s ... what &apos;s ... what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;ve been different since jack showed up .
kevin said you two were in a pretty intense conversation .
i wasn &apos;t gonna ask .
look , i asked jack to help me clear daniel &apos;s name .
don &apos;t . i &apos;ve already heard all of the reasons why it &apos;s a bad idea .
not from me you haven &apos;t ,
since you didn &apos;t even think to discuss it .
you know , a little heads @-@ up
that the girl i &apos;m dating was gonna retract
a statement she made in a case that i closed would have been nice ,
seeing how it could affect my job .
look , i would have told you .
when ? after you figured it out with jack ?
oh , don &apos;t make this about something that it &apos;s not .
then don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s nothing .
i know that it &apos;s not about him .
i know this is about what happened to margaux .
this is about everything .
people have gotten hurt and died because of all of this .
so much has happened that can &apos;t be undone .
this one thing ... this one thing i wanted to undo .
with another lie ?
this other story
is just gonna be like a snake chasing its own tail .
yeah , i know that , ben .
i live between two worlds .
you couldn &apos;t possibly understand .
yeah , but i want to .
oh , come on . don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t shut me out .
you should go to your party .
and you should come with me .
it might be nice for you to be around a bunch of people
who expect nothing from you but to have a good time .
with me at the head of that line .
ben .
look , i can see who you are , emily .
that &apos;s not a lie .
i hope you change your mind .
you still have your hand .
yeah , i cut myself pretty deep ,
but dr. raffin said there wasn &apos;t any real damage ,
so you didn &apos;t have to come by .
i feel responsible .
i shouldn &apos;t have attacked you earlier .
our kids aren &apos;t kids , stevie .
we can &apos;t hold their hand .
i know , but ...
jack &apos;s been so reckless when it comes to emily .
it ... scares me .
emily &apos;s his kryptonite , just like victoria was yours .
emily &apos;s not victoria .
i hope to god you &apos;re right .
glad you &apos;re okay .
you look beautiful .
you came .
you were right .
your new plan &apos;s the only way
to keep the police from looking under rocks .
and despite everything that we &apos;ve been through lately ,
i @-@ i &apos;m not letting you do this alone .
and besides , i &apos;m a sucker for a groundbreaking .
i &apos;m ready .
are you ?
and while i &apos;m not totally comfortable
getting lit with a bunch of cops ,
i am honored to raise a glass to my brother &apos;s friends ,
who i pray help him close cases ,
because he can &apos;t find his ass with both hands .
to detective hunter .
detective hunter .
cheers .
proud of you , bro .
thanks , man .
if you &apos;re looking for your girl ,
maybe you should check with your ex @-@ partner .
look , i told you ... they &apos;re just friends .
she and jack go way back .
there &apos;s nothing more to it .
you sure about that ?
it is because of the generosity of many donors
that we &apos;re able to break ground
for the new research wing here at southampton medical center ,
without further ado ...
may i ?
ms. thorne , i &apos;ve already spoken on behalf of the board .
i &apos;ve been very generous with this hospital over the years .
that should buy me five minutes at the podium , don &apos;t you think ?
of course .
good evening .
we &apos;re all aware of the scandal
casting a shadow over tonight &apos;s announcement .
the board elected not to name the research wing after my ex @-@ husband
because people believe that he broke into my house
and tried to attack me .
that is the story that i told that night .
but none of it is true .
the truth ...
is that malcolm black was my attacker .
he tried to kill me ,
and daniel grayson took a bullet ...
that was meant for me .
that night ...
daniel saved my life .
i told this story to protect myself
and the ones that i love ,
but it only festered .
and tonight it stops .
i know that none of this makes sense
and that there are many unanswered questions ,
like why was even i attacked that night ?
there &apos;s only one explanation .
there &apos;s one secret that i kept .
and it has cost the ones i love ...
more than i ever wanted .
what the hell , ems ?
i am david clarke &apos;s daughter .
i ... am amanda clarke .
