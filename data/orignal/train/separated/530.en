Don't tell me you got another case.
No, no, no, no, no. Baby, I'm coming home.
I swear I'm coming home.
Good. Me, too.
No!
What's wrong?!
Derek, are you there?
What's wrong?!
Wake him up.
He is awake.
What's he doing?
He's dissociating himself from the pain
he knows we're going to inflict.
Outstanding.
Hello hello hello!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!
What?
Daddy!
Oh, wow, yes!
Yes, yes, daddy is home!
Daddy is home.
Look at you, my beautiful babies.
My beautiful babies!
How are you guys doing today?
Good.
Oh, wow, what do you got?
Did you make this all by yourself?
For me?
Oh, it's so good.
It's so good.
You're late.
Daddy's in trouble.
So you know what? It's time for dinner.
Gotta go wash 'em up. Go, go, go, go!
You promised.
Baby, it was work.
You promised.
Come on, now. Work is work.
And work makes all of this work.
Yeah, it works because I put in a 10-hour shift
and made it home to do two sets of homework,
give two baths, and cook for 4.
Woman, do you know how much I love you?
How much I appreciate everything that you do?
How much?
This much.
Baby...
What is it?
Daddy's home.
You're late.
You promised.
You want to make it work, make this work.
It works because I put in a 10-hour shift,
made it home to do two sets of homework,
give two baths, and cook for 7.
Word.
You say you'll be home for dinner, be home for dinner.
She was waiting on you, Derek.
Get home for dinner, Derek.
Keep your word, Derek.
Where are you? Where are you, Derek?
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
Problem is, you're goin' in the wrong direction.
Can't avoid me forever.
Do I know you?
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
We're not going anywhere bad.
But we are going.
Come on.
His heart rate's back to baseline.
Start a fire.
Ok.
I get it.
I get it.
You, this. This is all in my head, right?
So I can survive what they're doing to me.
Who are you?
You want a hint?
Daddy?
Dad?
Derek
What did you find?
No sign of him. But they left this
in his car at the parking lot.
Could Savannah tell us anything?
She said she thought she heard 3 attackers
and that Morgan sounded drugged before they cut off the call.
Then it's a coordinated, planned attack,
most likely professional.
We did just take down a network of online hitmen,
but if this is blowback, why Morgan?
We have to assume that we're all targeted.
I've put protective details on each of our families,
but I want Savannah to stay here.
How is she?
She's being brave.
You know what the worst part is?
What?
I live with a profiler.
So I know things I shouldn't.
Like if they--if they wanted him dead,
he'd already be dead.
Right?
That's right.
Garcia needs us.
You can stay here.
Whatever we find out, we'll tell you.
I know wherever you are, you can hear me.
This is white phosphorus.
Fortunately for you,
there's a high ignition point.
So, uh, we have a few minutes.
It's good to see you, son.
Don't tell me you're not happy to see me.
Yes. Of course I'm happy to see you.
I just can't pretend that I don't know what this is.
That I'm just a figment of your imagination?
Yeah.
Maybe I'm here
because you're gonna die
and I'll make it less scary.
Or maybe I'm here to help you hang on.
Or maybe I'm a cop and you're a profiler
and I can help you understand how you got here.
I don't know how I got here.
I don't recognize those men.
When you start a case,
what's the first thing you look at?
Victimology.
Who's the victim?
Me.
We start there.
But here's the trick.
You want to make sense of this.
So you gotta start at the beginning.
You gotta go way back.
Where do we start?
November 7, 1985.
This is the block Derek was taken from.
That blue dot is him.
And then at 9:23, we lose him.
So I checked all the other cell signals in the area.
They're all legit, aside from one that I was only able to find
thanks to some technology
no one outside this room needs to know about.
What is that?
An encrypted signal most likely bouncing off a satellite.
I know we're thinking this would be tied
to our darknet investigation,
but satellite encryption is much higher in technology
than most online crime.
That's true, but the hitmen are still our best lead.
We need to exhaust that before we move on to other theories.
JJ, you and Garcia will take an armed agent to Savannah's house
and get her to pack a bag.
Yes, sir. Absolutely. But why me?
Because while she gathers her things,
we're going to see if they were under surveillance.
Whoever's behind this has been planning this for weeks,
if not months.
We have no time to catch up. Let's move.
He's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK.
Penelope, he's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be ok, he's gonna be OK,
He's gonna be ok, he's gonna be OK...
This isn't the first time I've done this.
But it will be the most that I've enjoyed it.
How am I supposed to do this, pop?
You know how. You do it with witnesses all the time.
What do you call that?
Cognitive interview.
That's the one.
Oh, man.
You know how many knuckleheads I could have put away
if I had your training?
The question is, can you apply that training to yourself?
Go ahead, Derek.
Do it.
It was November 7th.
I was in the fifth grade and I started throwing up
in the middle of math class.
Mom was at work, so you had to pick me up.
You were mad.
You thought I was faking.
Can you blame me? You faked out of school before.
You take that state capitals test?
Yeah.
How'd you do?
Got 'em all, I think.
What's the Capital of Nevada?
Carson City.
Oh. So close.
It's Las Vegas.
Nuh-uh.
The judges have spoken.
It is Las Vegas.
It's Carson City.
You want anything from the store?
Can I have a Gatorade?
One gatorade coming up.
Dad, stop!
This is 99-60.
We got a 212 at Marquette and Racine.
You stay here. Keep your head down.
Dad!
Dad!
I'll be OK.
I'll be OK.
Dad! No!
I'll be OK.
No...
Only you weren't OK.
Nothing was OK after that.
You had to accept something no one should have to accept.
Especially at 10 years old.
Which is that dads die.
My death...
Whose fault was it?
The man who pulled the trigger.
Yeah, him.
But who else?
Who do you blame?
You.
I blame you.
If you want to be angry at me, then be angry.
I can take it.
I'm not angry.
I never was.
No?
I blamed you for making me believe.
Believe what?
"If I were to remain a knight, said Arthur,
I should pray to God to let me encounter
all the evil in the world in my own person,
so that if I conquer, there will be none left.
And if I were defeated,
I would be the one to suffer for it."
It's getting late. Your mama's gonna kill me.
Oh, but it's just getting good.
You wait till Lancelot shows up.
Then it really gets good.
You're kind of like a knight, aren't you, dad?
Eh, never been on a horse before.
But I have saved a damsel in distress or two.
Night.
Are you protected by God like they were?
Come on, now. Of course I am.
Everyone with a badge is.
Now go on to sleep.
That's why I told you to stop the car.
I thought if you helped that lady, you'd be protected.
I would have done it anyway.
That's why I wasn't mad at you back then.
That's also when I had to start figuring things out for myself.
Like God.
He doesn't stop bullets, pop.
And he damn sure doesn't stop bad men.
I have to do that myself.
Fire in the hole!
It's burning.
Pop, it's burning!
Son, listen to me.
The man who's doing this wants to break you.
You hold out.
He'll make a mistake.
Will you stay with me through this?
Yes.
You promise?
Yes.
His heart rate's going back down.
That's impossible.
Cut him loose.
Why?
I want him naked.
Wait for this.
Wait for it.
Now.
Hey. So I just talked to your neighbors.
They didn't see anything,
And I didn't find anything forensic outside.
So, they weren't peeping on us through our windows?
Thank God for that, I guess.
That leaves you, Penelope.
Finishing my diagnostic now.
I think I have something.
Do you have a wireless router on your DVR?
Uh, I think so.
Ok.
They used it as their back door.
And then the encrypted phone call,
This is the hacking version of that same thing, and--
Oh, man, they were all up your business.
Was it the same unsubs?
My money says yes, but what what's weird
is they used an intranet.
What is that?
An intranet is a private closed system.
They use a portal to a public page.
Will someone explain why the CIA would abduct Derek?
Hey, Bob, it's Jennifer. I need a big favor.
Who are you?
Solomon-comma-
Edgar-hector-bravo- kilo-3-alpha-delta.
Why are you doing this to me?
Solomon-comma-edgar-
Hector--
Why are you doing this to me?
You're a job. An assignment.
They told me to bring you here and hurt you.
I do as I'm told.
Where's your backup?
No backup. Just--aah!
Just--just cleanup. Just cleanup.
When are they coming?
12 hours.
Isolation was the whole point,
so no one would ever find you.
Look for yourself.
We're stranded.
Good thing you know someone with a Ph.D in chemistry.
A couple years back when our troops
encountered white phosphorus in Iraq,
Reid took it upon himself to find a cure.
The kid wouldn't shut up about copper sulfate.
Well, maybe you should thank him the next time you see him.
Am I ever going to see him again?
That's up to you.
Just like your boss said,
you don't have enough for a profile yet.
Why are we back here?
You've been here before,
when you were 15 years old.
If I visited this place when I was 15, I would remember that.
Because you didn't visit it,
you built it.
What was going on at 15?
I don't want to talk about that.
We have to.
The man who did that to you
was a pillar in the community.
I met him before I died.
I was fooled, too.
I was just a kid.
I didn't know what to do.
So I did nothing.
That's not true.
You survived.
You created this space,
the space in your head the monster couldn't get to.
But that place never went away.
It was still here for you when you needed it.
Like now.
Are you ashamed of me?
I should have fought more, like...
You would have.
No.
I'm not ashamed of you.
I'm proud.
Proud?
How can you be proud?
Because you turned your pain into your greatest asset.
And I saw it.
You became the man of the house.
You took care of your sisters and your mother.
And that's why you're good at what you do.
My contact at the agency told me the guys who took Derek
are freelance contractors and not on our side.
So they're ex-spooks?
Mostly foreign, a few domestic.
These guys have figured out how to piggyback
on existing infrastructure to hide their tracks.
My contact thinks it might be this group.
It's hard to sync out who might be hitching
a ride on their computer traffic.
Fortunately, one of the CIA versions of me
is trying to crack their encryption signatures.
What do we know about them so far?
A 6-man team. They do dirty work for the highest bidder.
What kind of dirty work?
From what we can tell, disappearances.
If you need someone politically inconvenient to disappear,
These guys make that happen.
When you're in the field, what do you rely on?
My training.
Instinct.
And?
My team! The one I really need isn't here.
Hey there.
All you had to do was ask.
Hold on. Whoops. Hi.
Let's go.
He was giving me a name and a serial number.
Military training.
Yeah, but that combination of letters and numbers isn't in my database.
My database being your brain.
No rank. There was no rank.
He doesn't have rank. Not anymore. He's out.
That's not enough. I need more. Give me more.
Garcia, can you zoom in on the tattoo on his forearm?
Yeah.
Morgan's in more trouble than we thought.
"Who dares wins."
"Who dares wins."
That's the motto of the British special air service.
Which my system/slash/
your drunken night hanging out with scotland yard
is now filling me in on.
The S.A.S. designed the first survival course,
which our military used as the basis for sere school.
That in turn evolved into...
Enhanced interrogation techniques.
They're torturers, pop.
And they're coming back.
Listen...
I'll tell you, they're all dead.
I need an exfil now.
Just get me out of here.
No, no, now.
No, you listen.
Just get me out of here regardless.
You son of a bitch.
You got a phone?
He's here. He's killing me.
I need that phone.
Give me the phone!
No! No, don't do that!
No! No! Don't do that!
I just told you not to do that!
It won't work now. The phone is useless.
Whatever you swallowed you can throw back up.
Why are you doing this to me?!
Why-why are you doing this to me?
Why?!
Not like this!
Not--not like this.
Not like what?
You get to decide, do you?
No.
But I'm not doing this.
I'm not dying in some house in the middle of nowhere.
Well, you let me know when you're done with your temper tantrum.
That's a Dominican, right?
Yeah.
We had a day of the dead thing at work.
I put that in there for you.
I got it.
I'm back, pop.
Good. Think like a profiler.
Your team will find this farmhouse.
That's inevitable.
But what will they find
when they walk in the door?
FBI!
Morgan?
Spence.
Anyone want to say anything?
I do.
I do.
Hotch.
Hotch.
You've kept this team together, man.
I know that.
I want to thank you.
JJ.
JJ, you're one of the best people I know.
No, JJ, wait.
Rossi. Kid.
You've inspired me so much.
I never got to tell you that.
Baby girl.
Please stay with me.
No. No, please.
Please, don't leave me.
Stop that right now.
You're letting your fear take over.
I'm so tired.
You skipped over the most important part.
When your team comes through that door,
what are they gonna see?
Me, on the floor...
With a useless phone in my hand.
Wait.
If I press redial, one of those guys is gonna answer.
Exactly.
You see it now?
Yes, I--I see it.
I--I may have a line on him.
I just got notification from Fort Eustis.
That encrypted sat phone, it became active again
and we managed to pin down one side to here.
It is a 20-mile radius in Virginia.
The other side was to a contractor
who didn't even bother not to use his own cell phone.
Arrogant. He thinks we can't find him.
And he would be wrong.
He being John Bradley,
not S.A.S. as we had suspected.
Bradley and Mr. Who Dares Wins
tried to become S.A.S, but they couldn't cut it,
not to mention people who are S.A.S. don't get tattoos
saying S.A.S. because S.A.S. is covert.
That is the point.
But apparently people who are dishonorably discharged
from the British Royal Marines do get that tattoo.
Your last ping has him in Derek's direction.
He's probably on his way to him now.
We've got helos on the roof
standing by for immediate transport.
Any way we can narrow down the search?
Yes. Their encryption algorithms are dust.
If and when that sat phone connects, I've got him.
Hello?
Sir, it just went live.
Solomon, is that you, mate?
Ah, it's Agent Morgan, isn't it?
Is this the cleanup crew?
That's me.
Well, you got a whole hell of a lot of
cleaning up to do when you get here.
That's funny to you.
Yeah, what's funny is you trying to keep me on the line.
Even if your team finds you,
all they're gonna find is a corpse,
because I'm closer.
That's tough talk.
How are you feeling right now?
Not so good, I bet.
So, yeah, I'll be seeing you, real soon.
Son. Son?
Wait.
Come on.
What else is there?
How did you get here, Derek?
They kidnapped me,
from the grocery store.
I was buying food for dinner.
For who?
Savannah.
Do you love her?
Yes, I--I do.
There's the moment when you realize you love a woman,
and the moment you realize you're gonna marry her.
I want to hear about the second one.
It was the end of last year.
I'd gotten in late from a case.
It was a bad one.
She found me downstairs.
She didn't have to ask.
We just sat there, till the sun came up.
No words.
You were getting food from the store.
Does she cook a lot?
No.
She can't cook worth a damn.
I know dinner's ready when the smoke alarm goes off.
She knows it, too.
She hates her cooking almost as much as I hate eating it.
Must have been important, then, her wanting you home for a meal.
She said she wanted to tell me something.
Something bad?
No. It...
She said it was something good.
I just want to tell you I'm happy.
And maybe I'll show you how happy when I get home.
Ok. Ok. I like the way that sounds.
I think it was something wonderful, pop.
Yeah?
She's pregnant.
What are you gonna do, son?
Are you gonna make it home for dinner?
Hello, Agent Morgan.
You were an expensive job, mate.
After what you did here,
I'll finish you for free.
I say, is that all you got?
Dad!
Pop!
You said you were gonna stay with me through this!
Where are you?!
Right here, son.
Wakey, hmm?
Wake up.
Come on.
It's time to die.
Not yet.
Get medical in here.
Dad...
What is it, Morgan? What is it?
I'm scared, pop.
I can't feel anything.
Pop, I'm scared.
Dying is easy.
You know what's hard?
Not being there for your son.
I want to.
I do.
I want to be there for my family.
Savannah, mom, my sisters.
All of them, pop.
But what if I'm not strong enough?
That's why I walked you through those moments,
so you could see what I've seen for 30 years.
You are strong enough.
You've always been strong enough.
Pop...
I love you, son.
More than you will ever know.
Now go be a dad.
How long?
3 days.
Thank you.
Savannah.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I was late for dinner.
It's ok.
You made it.
No.
The next time you ask,
I will not be late for you.
Or our son.
How did you know?
I figured it out.
Then I guess I should probably tell you
that I don't know if it's a boy. It could be a girl.
Do you know how much I love you?
How much I appreciate everything that you do?
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Yes.
