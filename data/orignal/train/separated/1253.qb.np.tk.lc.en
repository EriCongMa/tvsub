did you see the article buried at the back of the paper ?
the cops are withholding details .
you &apos;re staying here ?
doctor &apos;s orders .
you &apos;re sara harvey , aren &apos;t you ? i &apos;m jenna marshall .
we need to get that jacket to a.d.
how can i fix this ?
maybe you can start by figuring out
why you &apos;re wearing one guy &apos;s ring
when you might have feelings for another .
have you guys met ?
no , i don &apos;t think we have .
this is detective marco furey . he is my new supervisor .
elliot rollins was last seen in baltimore .
we deliberately pointed the police towards philly .
that &apos;s where the trail was supposed to end .
somebody knows what i did .
will you marry me ?
aria , i called you last night after you went to ezra &apos;s .
yeah . i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t get back to you .
well , is everything okay ?
did he find out about the nicole call ?
no , he didn &apos;t . everything &apos;s fine .
will you just focus on living enemies instead of dead ones , please ?
what are you talking about ?
hanna thinks that rollins could still be alive .
that detective told ali
he a saw a photo of elliot rollins in a rental car .
hey , last time i checked , ghosts don &apos;t show up in photographs .
okay . we were all there that night , hanna .
the man is dead .
you killed him , and we buried him .
now , somebody knows .
so , frankly , that &apos;s bad enough
without having to go all &quot; walking dead . &quot;
she &apos;s right about the traffic cams , spence .
if there &apos;s a photo of him--
yeah , that could have easily been manufactured .
you find a rollins look @-@ alike and you stick him
behind the wheel of a mid @-@ size sedan .
the important thing is that a.d. &apos; s fake ..
thank you .
a.d. &apos; s fake rollins trail picks up
exactly where ours left off .
yeah . this has to be rollins &apos; partner in crime .
mary or jenna knows that we killed him
and they &apos;re helping cover it up .
you call that helping ?
&apos;a &apos; never does anything for free .
okay ? not test scores
and definitely not a cover @-@ up .
guys , if jenna was working with rollins
and she just found out what we did
she could be grooming sara to become her new seeing @-@ eye dog .
no , there is no grooming involved .
sara already hates us .
is that ..
yes , it is .
ali , where did you get that jacket ?
it was a gift . from a.d.
第七季第六集
we had no choice , okay ? a.d. was gonna kill him .
a.d. wanted charlotte &apos;s killer
and we , we thought that you were guilty .
well , you were wrong .
i know , but you had already checked yourself into welby
and we all thought that
elliot was gonna be able to protect you .
no , okay , you thought that
hanna &apos;s life was worth more than mine .
hey , in case you forgot , hanna just ran over the guy
who really is to blame for all of this .
we did everything we could to save you , ali .
just like we did everything we could to save hanna .
what is it ?
mary said detective furey is at home with an update .
i &apos;ve gotta go .
well , i &apos;m coming with you .
i don &apos;t really care that you &apos;re pissed at us .
okay ? i care that you &apos;re safe .
and if anyone had the opportunity
to sneak that jacket and that note from a.d. into your bedroom ,
it &apos;s mary drake , who &apos;s sleeping one room over .
we all should have followed her .
she just needs some time , em .
spencer .
oh , we @-@ we &apos;ve really gotta stop group texting each other .
she &apos;s going to ali &apos;s house to keep eyes on mary drake .
so , now , we &apos;re back on mary ?
spencer &apos;s gonna follow mary , i &apos;m gonna keep tabs on jenna .
she &apos;s staying at the radley and so is sara .
do you still have rollins &apos; burner phone ?
i &apos;ll let you know if i hear anything .
you sure everything &apos;s okay ?
yeah . fine .
detective furey , thank you so much for waiting .
not a problem at all , miss dilaurentis .
hello , again .
hi .
please , have a seat .
yeah .
miss dilaurentis ...
this person that you married
is actually a man named archer dunhill .
he &apos;s 32 years old . born in wales .
what else do you know about him ?
he &apos;s wanted in the uk for several counts
of petty theft and fraud .
uh , what about the rental car ?
the traffic camera photo ?
uh , we &apos;re looking into it .
officer cavanaugh has been dispatched to meet
with a number of witnesses personally .
now , there was a rental car in rollins &apos; name .
now , we don &apos;t believe that archer dunhill was in it .
but we do suspect that the car rental ,
train ticket , all this was created to divert our attention
from what really happened .
what really happened ?
uh , we &apos;re not exactly sure .
but you have a theory .
why continue using the credit cards
if you &apos;ve already disappeared ?
we suspect he wanted us to find those charges
to follow that trail .
he &apos;s making it look like archer dunhill &apos;s long gone
when , in fact , he could be much closer than we thought .
why ? why would he do that ?
perhaps he &apos;s got unfinished business here .
we do believe that alison &apos;s still in danger .
oh , my god .
now , you have 24 @-@ hour police protection
and we &apos;re doubling our efforts to find him .
miss dilaurentis , i give you my word
we will get this guy .
detective furey ?
marco !
uh ... do you have a minute ?
of course .
i just really wanted to clear the air since our , um ..
moment ?
yeah .
i obviously did not know that
you were a police officer at the time .
and you have a problem with law enforcement ?
no . i--
yeah , no ?
okay , yeah .
uh , you &apos;re investigating my friend &apos;s husband .
i wouldn &apos;t want anything to get complicated .
not that you &apos;re at all interested in anything with me
i just , um .. just saying .
okay .
is there anything she could be holding back ?
anything that would help the investigation ?
no . no , i think s @-@ she told you everything .
thank you .
yeah .
&apos;hi . i @-@ i just wanted to make sure that you got home okay.&apos;
&apos;i know you left upset , and we @-@ we both , we both were .. &apos;
&apos;call me when you get this . please.&apos;
i left that blank on purpose .
because i &apos;m not a fortune @-@ teller , lucas .
how am i supposed to know
the first quarter financial projections ?
alright , so what else did you not like
about the business plan ?
everything . got it .
you know , this would be a lot easier if you were here .
in person .
because i have a degree in fashion
not boring numbers that don &apos;t add up .
hold on one second .
hey , i &apos;m gonna have to call you back .
yes , i nixed the pie charts .
alright , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
bye .
&apos;next time you bury someone , make sure they &apos;re dead.&apos;
that voice may have sounded like rollins , but he &apos;s dead .
he &apos;s really , truly dead .
yeah , well , we thought ali was dead too , remember ?
and she survived .
i mean , back in the 1900s
they used to bury people alive all the time .
they used to find scratch marks inside of coffins .
hanna , seriously , you &apos;ve gotta stop reading wikipedia .
jenna or mary &apos;s trying to torment you
by using a voice that sounds like rollins .
they @-@ they probably just want the burner phone back
so they can protect their own identity .
and what if you &apos;re wrong ?
you know what he did to me .
and that was before i ran into him with a car .
we have to tell the police .
tell them what ?
that you got a call on a phone they don &apos;t even know exists ?
how are you gonna explain that ?
i saw him .
i saw his eyes , and he saw mine .
he knows it was me .
hanna , elliot is not gonna hurt you anymore .
he can &apos;t ... okay ?
hanna ?
&apos;hey , you &apos;ve reached aria montgomery .. &apos;
here is your ice tea .
oh , thank you .
is everything okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
did aria say something to you ?
no . why , is something going on with you two ?
no . no , i @-@ i &apos;m good . really .
i just came here to get some work done .
radley bar .
and what &apos;s the order ?
what &apos;s the room number ?
room 303 .
i &apos;ll send that right up , miss marshall .
no , i haven &apos;t heard from hanna either .
did you check with em ?
yeah .
no sign of hanna , but she just spotted sara
going up to jenna &apos;s room .
well , either jenna or mary orchestrated
that call to rollins &apos; burner phone
and all of those bogus charges to his credit card .
so , if i can find his credit card information
inside the lost woods , maybe i can convince hanna
that &quot; the revenant &quot; was just a really twisted movie .
it was based on a true story , spence--
whatever .
maybe you should wait till you get backup .
it &apos;s not me that i &apos;m worried about .
besides , i &apos;ve already broken into this place .
已满
i can get in and out without being detected .
just be careful .
yeah , just find hanna .
spencer . i thought you were elliot .
you scared me half to death . inside . come on !
all that security at alison &apos;s .
i mean , don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s a good thing
but i &apos;m the one who broke ranks with the bastard .
it &apos;s me he wants .
so you believe them ? the police ?
that archer dunhill &apos;s still in the area ?
yes .
have you heard from him ?
no .
he &apos;s not in there .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re looking for elliot ?
yeah , i just .. i thought that if you and he worked together
then he would know this place inside and out
and it would be a good place for him to hide .
well ... if he were here , i &apos;d probably be dead already .
that man has a temper like you &apos;ve never seen .
and you cross him ..
let &apos;s just say he handled ali with kid gloves
compared to what he &apos;d do to me .
then why are you still here if you &apos;re so afraid ?
i needed to get a few things to take back to alison &apos;s .
spencer , wait . he &apos;s dangerous .
don &apos;t go out there empty handed .
okay .
it &apos;s okay . there &apos;s no one out here .
hanna ?
please tell me you didn &apos;t just--
don &apos;t worry , i didn &apos;t go in .
i wanted to , but i &apos;ve just been sitting here .
so i talked to spencer .
she &apos;s starting to believe mary &apos;s story .
so that leaves us with jenna .
wow , it &apos;s like we never left .
i know .
why couldn &apos;t we have been one of those people ?
i &apos;m not saying their lives are perfect .
i don &apos;t need perfect .
i &apos;d settle for boring .
functional .
you couldn &apos;t be boring if you tried .
ezra proposed .
marriage ? when ?
last night .
you said no ?
i said i have to think about it .
i @-@ i can &apos;t promise ezra forever
when my future could be spent behind bars .
we killed someone , hanna . we can &apos;t just walk away from that .
and now a.d. knows .
ezra wants a marriage , a wife .
not conjugal visits .
maybe that &apos;s not your decision to make .
maybe it &apos;s his .
does that mean you told jordan what happened ?
i mean , i @-@ i guess that &apos;s why i , i texted you earlier .
i mean , if you guys can make it work , then maybe ..
hanna ! what are you ..
no .
it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s a diamond .
no , it &apos;s not .
i gave jordan his ring back
and i bought a fake one
so i wouldn &apos;t have to tell people the truth .
we broke up .
you didn &apos;t want spencer to know .
or my mom .
or our caterer . i mean , she was really invested .
han ..
listen to me ..
jordan and i were not ... meant to be .
i know that now .
but you and ezra , that &apos;s a whole different story .
don &apos;t let this be how it ends .
come on .
hey , caleb .
am i interrupting ?
oh , no , no , no .
take a seat .
what &apos;s with the bag ? are you coming or going ?
uh , i &apos;m trying to figure that out actually .
i got my car , thinking i might head back to dc or new york .
and you ended up back in rosewood .
yeah . funny how that happens .
what about you and spencer ?
we , uh ..
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know what we are right now .
because of hanna ?
because of a lot of things .
you know , sometimes , i think i know everything about this place .
and that other times , i feel like you could write me a book
about everything i don &apos;t know .
yeah .
well , i &apos;ll let you know when i &apos;m ready to write the sequel .
don &apos;t you feel like that , though ?
like , there &apos;s something they &apos;re not telling us .
like what ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just a feeling .
and what about you ? how &apos;s your novel coming ?
good , i think .
i &apos;m , uh ... on my last round of notes .
there a happy ending ?
yeah . i &apos;m working on it .
it &apos;s open .
you can set it on the coffee table . thank you .
i left him a message .
hello , emily .
emily ? what are you doing here ?
she was looking at your computer .
someone is threatening us again . and i think it &apos;s you .
really ?
how come ?
cause you &apos;re here in rosewood .
and you &apos;re putting on a concert for her .
we &apos;re not threatening you , emily .
i know you don &apos;t believe me ,
but i really was looking out for you .
i care about you .
and all we &apos;re doing is looking for the same thing you are .
stop talking , sara .
that &apos;s enough .
what sara meant to say is
mind your own damn business , emily .
this is my business , jenna .
what i &apos;m confused about is how you &apos;re involved .
elliot rollins is a fraud .
and somehow ,
you knew his real identity before anyone else .
the police are looking for anyone with information .
i can give them your name
or you can explain to me what the hell is going on .
the truth ? charlotte was my friend .
so , everything &apos;s working out well with you two ?
it certainly is .
we have you to thank .
doctor rollins speaking .
i &apos;ll be right there .
duty calls , i &apos;m afraid .
wait here .
archie , wait .
can &apos;t thank you enough for being here .
i don &apos;t know what i would have done if you ...
i know . but i &apos;m here now .
and i love you .
so
so
i was hoping to bring you more good news .
about my birth mother , did you find her ?
no , nothing yet , but i @-@ i promise you i will find her .
she &apos;s coming today to meet the new doctor .
alison ?
she &apos;s not the person that you remember .
archie needs to win her trust .
convince her that i &apos;m doing better .
alison is the only chance that i have of getting out of here .
well , he &apos;s a charmer .
he should throw in a few compliments .
ali loves a suck @-@ up , always has .
archer can handle it .
he knows everything about me .
my family , my upbringing ,
everything i &apos;ve done .
everything .
and he loves me .
he wants me out of here as much as i do .
well , you &apos;re lucky .
that kind of love is rare .
i &apos;m lucky to have you too .
so you got archer into welby .
i knew someone ..
... who helped archer get a passport , a new identity ,
so they could be together .
and how exactly did your friendship with charlotte begin ?
i read about her , emily .
wasting away in that hospital .
so i reached out .
i figured she &apos;d welcome a visit even from a stranger .
but you see , i wasn &apos;t a stranger .
mona had told her everything about me
i was ... a celebrity .
but she &apos;s gone now .
murdered .
a few weeks after it happened , i reached out to archer .
and guess who answered his cell phone ?
you think the cops wanna talk to me ?
as far as i can tell , you and your little friend
are the last people to see archer before he just ... poof !
he disappeared .
maybe they should ask you where he is .
well , your guess is as good as mine .
you should go , emily .
do not come back here .
is that a threat ?
i &apos;m trying to keep you safe , emily .
i want you to be safe . please , don &apos;t come back .
okay , look , i &apos;m not afraid of jenna .
i &apos;m not talking about jenna .
i &apos;m talking about ...
sara !
i need you .
now .
我们能聊聊吗
you need to take that ?
no . that &apos;s alright .
i &apos;m so sorry , spencer .
and you were right . i am confused .
i never meant ...
i know .
look , we both made mistakes .
and i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s okay .
but i really don &apos;t regret trying .
you don &apos;t ?
when toby and i broke up ...
... i didn &apos;t date anyone for a really , really long time .
and nothing serious anyways , you know , it &apos;s just ...
nothing ever stuck .
nothing ever measured up .
it was like my ...
... my heart had just stopped .
and i felt that way for a really long time ...
... until you .
oh , spence ...
no , it &apos;s good .
i &apos;m saying , it &apos;s a good thing .
okay , &apos; cause , i &apos;ve , i hurt .
believe me , i hurt .
but i ...
i get to remember what it felt like ..
... to be in love again .
i think that you should probably go .
okay .
bye , caleb .
bye .
welcome back .
you went through my bags .
you should know better than to take my mom &apos;s things .
we both know the conditions of your release from welby
but if you want me gone ..
i &apos;d like you to explain a few things .
gaps in your story .
you said you never met charlotte .
yes .
when i met her , she went by a different name .
cece drake .
i wonder how she got the name drake
if she never met you .
charlotte called herself cece drake ?
i .. no , i didn &apos;t know that .
oh , i honestly ..
we never met .
truly .
i don &apos;t know how she ended up with that name .
except that maybe ..
... maybe she knew about me .
jessica told her .
or she found out , i don &apos;t know .
this is from charlotte . from her birth .
the doctor was impatient .
after a while , he just cut me open
and ... took the baby out .
i didn &apos;t even get to hold him ...
jessica took my child from me .
she took my baby just like she took everything else .
just like she took that necklace when we were children .
hey , come in .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t call you back .
well , you -- you &apos;re here now .
can i just say something ?
i thought we were in a different place than we are
and that is okay .
we could take a step back .
we -- we don &apos;t have to get married .
we can just be together ...
ezra .
i want to marry you .
i wanna say yes , more than anything .
but something happened .
and it , it &apos;s something that might make you wish
you never asked me that question .
you can tell me anything , aria .
yeah , well , the thing is , i can &apos;t un @-@ tell you .
we should probably sit down .
i &apos;m so sorry .
she lied to me . she lied about everything .
doctor ... mary drake ..
... being friends with jenna .
that doesn &apos;t mean that charlotte didn &apos;t love you .
love me ?
i didn &apos;t even know she had a boyfriend .
and then i married him .
because , ali , it went too far .
he took matters into his own hands .
i thought we were sisters , em .
i wasn &apos;t her confidant or her friend .
i was just this ..
... stepping stone so she could get out of that place .
we had our first kiss right here .
it was christmas eve .
elliot somehow got the hospital board
to approve charlotte staying overnight .
he made me think it was my idea .
that charlotte could live here .
that together we could convince the judge
that she was stable and in good hands .
ali ...
don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t have to go through this alone .
i know you &apos;re upset we gave your jacket to a.d.
and you have every right to be--
spencer already explained it to me .
well , she left something out .
we are so sorry .
i ... am so sorry , ali .
i know .
i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
you didn &apos;t have to pretend .
i know .
didn &apos;t work anyway .
no .
are you okay ?
i absolutely will be .
you should tell him .
you should tell caleb that you and jordan broke up .
i haven &apos;t told anyone about this .
i had a dream about you .
when i was in that place with a.d.
i was so tired and scared .
i wanted to give up .
and then suddenly , there you are .
you were all smart
and preppy and ..
ready to hatch an escape plan .
i really wish i could have been there , hanna .
i wish that i could have helped you .
you did . that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
you and ... all you &apos;ve taught me over the years .
is that your phone ?
no .
it &apos;s rollins .
first you turn her in , then you leave her all alone
stupid bitches .
ali , thank god , where are you ?
home . why ?
are the police still outside your house ?
yeah . what &apos;s going on , hanna ?
we think a.d. is heading your way .
he might even be there already .
you mean jenna and sara .
no , he , as in elliot rollins .
the same guy who put a muzzle over you
and fed you crazy pills .
he crawled out of his own damn grave
and he &apos;s coming for you .
ali , it &apos;s spencer .
look , hanna might be right , so just make sure that
that cop doesn &apos;t leave your side , and we are on our way .
oh , my god .
officer .
can you please come inside ?
my friends think that archer dunhill could be on his way
so if you could just wait in here until backup comes .
spence .
yeah , yeah , he &apos;s inside now .
okay . i will .
officer ?
hello ?
我回来了
elliot ?
we need to set up a checkpoint now .
and somebody better tell me why
officer sheehan wasn &apos;t at his post .
ali ?
alison ..
where is she ?
where &apos;s ali ?
it &apos;s okay , spencer .
she &apos;s okay . alison &apos;s upstairs .
thank you .
oh , my god , alison . oh , my god .
oh , god , you &apos;re hurt .
i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;m just glad that you guys are here .
what happened ?
he was dressed up like a cop .
he had on another mask .
he could have killed me , but i think
the police sirens scared him off .
it was really him , wasn &apos;t it ?
was that hanna ?
yeah , ali &apos;s okay
but archer dunhill could still be out there .
i love this song .
yeah . my mom had quite the record collection .
mary brought a box down from the attic .
where was she when that happened ?
she was meeting with her contractor .
the police confirmed it .
come on . sit down , you need to rest .
em ..
god , i &apos;m so sorry .
for what ?
elliot knew that i &apos;d push you away
and make myself vulnerable .
that &apos;s why he put the jacket in my room .
i fell right for it .
aria .. ... look at me .
i &apos;m gonna try this one more time .
will you marry me ?
wait .. is ... that a yes ?
yes .
yes , ezra .
completely , absolutely , yes . yes .
this is a really bad idea . we shouldn &apos;t be here .
okay , but we can &apos;t just take a.d. &apos; s word for it .
we need proof .
it &apos;s fine .
let &apos;s go .
this is it .
this is the spot .
it looks just like it did before .
i guess he could have crawled out
and covered the hole back up .
well , there &apos;s only one way to know for sure .
i don &apos;t remember digging this much .
that &apos;s because you didn &apos;t .
you were in shock .
i don &apos;t know , maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe he &apos;s not here .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s him .
hello ?
hello , miss ?
are you alright ?
