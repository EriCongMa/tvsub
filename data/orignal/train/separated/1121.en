I saw him in the woods.
He left an "A" message.
What did you see?
Enough.
Noel Kahn is "A."
Don't say anything to anyone. Promise me.
Your mother thinks you're keeping some kind of secret.
I'm... gay.
Why didn't she tell us?
She was afraid.
This is what she's afraid of.
Lucas, I am being honest with you. I have a boyfriend.
And I think you deserve a better boyfriend.
Somebody decided to pay a visit to Alison's memorial.
Mom, this is Alex Santiago.
Good serve.
From the club.
I'm the last Potter.
When I go, that's the end of the line.
We're married.
Spence, what just happened?
Who wrote that?
What? What's on there?
Get it off! Just wipe it off!
Get it off me!
Why are you taking that off?
I'm not. I'm trying to keep it on.
Believe me, I don't want to see the autograph that's under it.
We can get you another sticker.
This time, why don't you try something mellower,
like "Save the planet"?
There were not a lot of choices, okay?
It was either humpty dumpty
or "Jesus is coming. Look busy."
Oh, God, it's still there.
Hanna. Hanna, don't, okay?
Don't look at that.
Just look around you, 'cause you're safe,
You're home, and you're alive.
I thought I was safe in my hospital room, too.
What's going on with Noel Kahn?
Is he "A"? Have you talked to him?
No, I avoid him.
I keep telling him I'm busy--
busy freaking out every time I look at him.
Yeah, well, try being run over by him.
Who got you this panda?
Sean?
Lucas.
Oh, sweet.
Anyone else starving, or is it just me?
Your mom said she left a special dinner for you in the fridge.
Pass.
I want a pop-tart.
What?
I've been on hospital food for three weeks.
I want to eat something that
doesn't look like it's already been chewed.
Why don't you eat while we go get the rest of your stuff.
'kay?
Hanna?
Hey, so, if you're gonna stay down here tonight,
we were, um...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Down here's good.
What happened?
Nothin'.
Just knocked a few boxes down.
No, no, no, no. You don't have to clean.
Uh, you can go. Seriously,
my mom's gonna be here soon.
Wait... So now you want us to leave?
You don't have to put on a brave face for us, okay?
We get it. If being alone is freaking you out,
we can absolutely stay as long as you...
No, no, no. I'm just-- I'm fuzzy,
and I think it's from this pain medication.
Yeah, I need a nap.
Okay. Can we help you to the couch?
No, you've done enough.
Seriously, you guys, go.
Okay. Call me?
Yeah.
Yeah. Me, too, any time.
You know you have to boil that first, right?
Yeah.
你能摆脱腿上放的犯罪证据吗 -A
So, do you like? .
I could go back and get the one with a built-in heating pad.
What happened to the no-spending zone?
Honey, you are gonna be on the couch a lot.
You should at least be comfortable.
Last month, we could barely afford basic cable
and bubble bath,
And now you're...
I told you, things are better now.
The bank loan came through.
In a lasagna box?
As I see, you've had time to go exploring while I was out.
Mom, there are thousands of dollars in there.
Hanna...
We were days away from a foreclosure.
Where'd it come from?
The bank.
It is a loan.
Unauthorized.
Yeah, but what does that mean?
It means just what I said. I borrowed it,
from a customer who will never know it was borrowed
because it's all gonna be replaced by the end of the year.
So you stole it?
Listen to me. This is our lifeline.
I was able to get our mortgage current,
and what's left in this box is our cushion.
And I will pay it all back. All of it.
How?
Mom?
I never intended for you to know about it. That's why I hid it.
I figured in a box of carbs
that's been sitting up there untouched for 10 years
was a safer bet than my old makeup bag.
My mistake.
This is my problem.
You just need to worry about getting better, okay?
Okay. I'm gonna take a shower.
I like these sausages. What are they, chicken?
No, they're turkey.
So, does your friend have any allergies?
What?
Is there anything I should know about what Maya eats?
No. She eats everything.
Dad, I know I asked for it,
but if mom can't handle this dinner tonight,
I'll just tell Maya...
We're looking forward to it.
Your mother was up all last night preparing the menu.
You don't think she'll try and poison her, do you?
Your mother?
That's not her style.
She'd kill her with kindness.
Get in.
I can't.
My mom will be out any second.
And she's not gonna believe
that you came all this way just for coffee.
Well, I didn't. I came for the kiss.
Let's do this later.
Yeah.
Okay.
No, honey, leave the boxes there for now.
Do not call her. It's their honeymoon.
Okay. Bye.
What's going on?
Ian had all his boxes
delivered this morning from his storage unit.
It couldn't wait till they got back?
I'm guessing he and Melissa
probably want to get a jumpstart on settling in.
Why are you so shocked?
Because you're not.
You and dad are acting as if
you're totally okay with this whole elopement thing.
You don't think this was rushed?
Of course it's rushed. It's outrageous.
I'm not dancing a jig over it,
But what's done is done.
Besides, a long engagement
doesn't guarantee wedded bliss either.
Oh, honey, would you hold this? I'm buzzing.
Oh, speak of the devil.
Ian?
Mnh. Melissa.
Another picture.
The honeymooners.
Where are they?
Looks like that mall near dad's office.
I guess when you're in love, you can be anywhere.
You don't think it's weird,
Melissa trading in her princess gown and pink champagne
for a food court Slurpee?
Spencer, you were a big part of your sister's rough year.
Maybe you could just be happy for her.
Why is he out of jail?
He's out on bail.
He's probably meeting with his attorney.
Honey, you'll be late,
and staring at him won't make him disappear.
Come on. Let's go.
Ooh. Maybe we should just give her one book at a time.
Hanna doesn't really do well with stacks--
Unless they're catalogues.
Hi, Maya.
Hey there.
Are you still coming for dinner tonight?
Sure, if your folks still want me to.
What should I wear?
Anything. Doesn't matter.
A dress.
A dress? Seriously?
Is this some sort of formal thingy,
or are you just worried my jeans are too butch?
Don't say things like that, please, okay?
They're not-- they won't laugh.
Well, I'll see you guys later, so,
have fun tonight, but, FYI,
if you decide to wear jeans, iron them.
Emily...
Are you still into this dinner?
Of course.
I just...
my parents have been acting strange
since I told them about me.
Us.
Define "Strange."
Whispering, closing doors,
changing the channel when Ellen comes on.
Got it.
I will wear the girliest dress I own.
I'll tell them I sewed it myself.
Maya, this isn't a joke.
My mom isn't your mom, okay?
Gatsby...
was more than just a pretty face.
He was ambitious, ruthless, charming,
and the themes of change and loss
are central to both novels.
Did everybody get their papers back?
Perfect!
See you Wednesday.
Oh, chapters one and four. No study guides, please.
Read the man, not the blogger.
You guys go ahead.
I'll get Hanna's assignment and meet up with you.
I know who wrote that message on your car.
It was Noel Kahn.
But he admitted it was stupid.
He was just angry and jealous.
Yeah, I get why he did it.
Who else knows?
Nobody. Nobody else knows.
Look, and he's not gonna tell anyone.
How do you know that?
Because... I think he may have known about us
for a while now,
But if he was trying to hurt us,
he would have said something a long time ago.
But he promised he'd just forget what he saw.
Look, let's not talk about this here.
Can I come to your place later?
I'm just not sure I want to be there.
It'll be fine.
Just... make sure Maya doesn't do all the talking.
If she starts going over a cliff, you grab the wheel.
Spencer, Emily, wait up.
I just found out that Hanna's mom's got
some bank thing in Scranton
and won't be home till really late, so...
I want to do a surprise party.
You know, "Welcome home, Hanna.
We love you, with or without your spleen."
I've checked with Mr. Hanna,
and Sean is totally down with it.
They... didn't take out her spleen.
Really? Oh.
Then I'll just change the theme.
Mona...
I'm really not sure Hanna's up to hosting
a bunch of people at a party.
Oh, please. She's been socializing with
I.V. Bags and bedpans.
She'll love it.
If you guys don't want to come, I'm sure she'll understand.
Mr. Fitz?
Got a second?
Uh... sure.
What's up, Noel?
Wanted to talk to you about something.
These comments on my paper.
Pretty harsh.
Oh. I wasn't trying to be.
I worked really hard on this.
I'm sure you did,
But you clearly hadn't read all the material.
I think I know... enough...
to get a better grade than this.
What are you asking me to do, Noel?
Change the grade?
'cause that's not gonna happen.
Mr. Fitz,
you don't want me to bring the principal into this, do you?
Take another read. You may have second thoughts.
I think it deserves this.
Hey there.
Turns out there's this surprise party for Hanna,
So I'm thinking, um, I'll just go there first
and then come by.
You're not coming over.
Why? What happened?
I had a visit from your friend Noel.
Turns out he's not too good at keeping promises.
In fact, he's not at all who you think he is.
Did he say something to you?
Ezra.
Tell me what-- what happened?
Maybe I can fix it.
Mr. Fitz.
What can I do for you, Jenna?
Mr. Mazarra said you need to sign my absence card.
Sure. Let me... Let me get a pen.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Sorry to interrupt.
Hey, I'm sorry. Practice ran late.
What's this?
Member of the club gave it to me.
It's a tennis clinic in Sweden.
Sweden? Why did he give it to you?
He wants me to apply.
A lot of the people who go to it
end up playing in the Swedish open.
Alex, that's amazing! You have to do it!
Maybe I could get an internship over there,
like in Stockholm or something.
Spencer, slow down. I'm not going.
Why? If this guy recommended you,
he must think you're up to it.
I think you're up to it. You are fantastic.
I can't go.
I told my uncle I'd work for him.
He needs the bodies.
Your uncle can find other bodies to help him rip down buildings.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
I don't want to go.
So you'd rather spend the rest of your summer
tossing broken plaster in a dumpster?
That's insane.
Maybe to you.
I'm not interested in playing pro.
I'd rather be here, working, saving for college.
Okay, I get that, and that's good, but...
how can you turn this down?
Like this.
So, you ready?
So...
where in Texas will you be stationed?
Fort hood. But I'm not leaving just yet.
No, thank you.
I don't eat seafood.
It's not a moral thing. I get hives.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Emily said that you could eat anything, so...
I forgot. Sorry.
It's okay. Um...
I'm really sorry.
It's all right. It's fine.
Are both your folks from California, Maya?
Yeah. They, uh...
They met in Berkley at a no-nukes rally.
After my brother and I came along,
they got married, and we moved to San Jose.
So you were already here when your parents got married?
I was the flower girl.
Oh, um, I guess they wanted to make sure it was real
before they tied the knot.
Two children wasn't real enough?
Um... tell the story of how your dad asked your mom.
So, my dad's this raging, crazy romantic.
He proposed to my mom with a sharpie.
Oh, he didn't have a ring,
So he drew one on her finger with a felt pen.
That's a very clever placeholder.
No, that's the only one she's ever had.
Once the ink wore off,
she retraced it with a tattoo.
Wow. See, now why didn't I think of that?
Excuse me while I check on the roast.
And honey, be careful. Our anniversary is coming up.
I'm gonna invest in some felt-tip markers.
So, where you going after this?
What are you talking about?
Well, when my mom told me
you were gonna give up your Friday night
to help me study math...
I never said math.
I said I would get you up to speed.
So... can we discuss Claudia Rice?
I don't know who that is.
Yes, you do. Skinny, skinny jeans.
Won't wear anything unless it's tight enough
to make blood come out of her ears.
Whoa, what was that?
What was what?
I just saw a shadow at your door.
No, wait, Mona, don't open the door.
Call the police.
Oh, hush, baby Jane.
Mona, don't!
Surprise!
Uh, Noel, what-- what are you doing?
Please don't open that.
Jackpot.
That's it, Noel! We're over!
What?
Happy now?
What happened?
I just put Noel Kahn back on the market.
How? You broke them up?
We broke them up.
Aren't you still crushing on him, Aria?
What did "we" do, Alison?
What's with the 'tude, guys?
I did it for Aria.
I only kill when we need food.
And when I'm bored.
Buona sera.
Hey, Lucas.
Long time, no talk. How are you?
Thirsty.
You can have your own cup.
So... were you surprised?
Yeah. I still am.
Did you get my e-mails?
Yeah, I got 'em.
Well, you know, I'm behind in every class,
So, if you want to study together...
I'm kind of off studying at the moment.
Been there, done that.
This semester, I plan to go from honor roll to toilet roll.
What is this?
Yeah, I would slow down on that.
Mona made that, so...
I'm fine, mom.
I'm not driving,
and this isn't my first time playing margaritaville.
Want some?
Hanna-banana, where is that photo of you and me at the lake?
You know, the one where we won the chicken fight.
I don't remember, Sean. Sure you do.
It's you and Sean.
Me Tarzan, you Jane Austen.
You got a problem?
Nope. Mnh-mnh. Just amusing myself.
Did I embarrass you?
Sorry, about the shrimp thing.
Had I eaten that, I would have blown up.
Stop.
They really liked you.
Dad was definitely hooked, and mom liked the dress.
Wait till she sees the crease in my jeans.
Do you want to change before we go to Hanna's?
Would it be okay if I bailed on that?
I'm exhausted. I didn't sleep last night.
I was way too nervous.
About dinner?
Because when I saw you at school, you were totally all right.
One of us had to hold it together.
You were one buckle short of a straitjacket.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I just wanted to make sure
and give Maya something to take to her folks.
That's so sweet. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Here you go.
Thanks.
So, um, I was thinking--
My parents have this little place up in Bucks county.
What if we, uh, could sneak away up there next weekend?
Please just don't say no until I at least show you a picture.
You had me at "I was thinking."
What just happened?
Nothing. I just--
just a little bit busy, here.
Well, let's go outside.
Okay. I'll meet you out there.
I'm just gonna go upstairs and use the bathroom.
Okay.
There you are! Where you been?
Sean got this amazing
picture of Hanna's face when we surprised her.
She might have peed herself. It was classic.
You broke your promise.
You promised me you'd forget what you saw in Mr. Fitz's car,
but you're not letting it go.
Back up. What are we talking about?
You know exactly what I'm talking about, okay?
And you can't just blackmail him...!
Blackmail? Is that what he said?
You never demanded a better grade?
I didn't demand anything.
I asked him to take a second look at my essay.
I mean, haven't you ever worked hard
and thought you deserved something better than what you got?
Wow.
If that's the story he put out there,
then you've really got to wonder who this guy is.
Noel...
Is there something else going on here?
Is there some old grudge you've got against me and my friends?
Noel, come check this out.
Pritzker's got this video of the barracuda game.
It's your shining moment, dude.
Did Jenna tell you I tried to reach you,
when you were still in jail?
No.
Well, I did.
I wanted you to know that I wasn't the one.
I never told the police where you were.
I gotta go.
Where?
There's a-a party at Hanna's.
Lucky you.
I can barely leave my porch.
But that's okay.
I don't get many invitations.
Just death threats.
Do you believe me?
That's what I asked you,
before the cops picked me up.
I never got an answer either.
Hey, hold still.
Look, would you be cool if I left a little early?
Now?
Where you going? Hot faculty party?
It was a joke.
Was it?
Aria.
No, it bothers you, me and Ezra. I can...
I can tell by the way you're looking at me.
I mean, come on. It's not like things aren't different now.
Parties like this must feel like you're babysitting.
Wh--? I don't feel like that at all.
I-I never should have told you guys.
No, you should have told us a long time ago,
when it started.
I mean, this whole time, I thought I was helping you
get over this Viking boy in Iceland
who, turns out, doesn't exist.
I mean, I thought we were close.
We tell each other everything.
I couldn't. I swore to Ezra that he could trust me.
Well, we trusted you too.
Right.
And now I've blown it with everyone.
It took forever to get into that bathroom.
Mona was spending quality time with her eyebrows.
Hey, what's wrong?
I-I'm gonna take off.
Why, where are we going?
I don't know what you're doing, but I'm going home.
Couldn't resist, could you?
What am I looking at?
An e-mailed confirmation
of my application to that tennis clinic.
Okay.
Which was sent in electronically.
You think I did that?
You're the only person I told.
Yeah, but I didn't.
Spencer, get real.
Okay, you and I want different things,
and you say that you're okay with that,
but you're not, and you never will be.
I did not send that in,
but I apologize if I made you feel like--
Don't apologize for who you are and what you want.
I'm not going to.
亲亲抱抱 A
And she's all, like...
And so now, Hanna's on top of the bunny hill,
but I had to, like, hypnotize her
to get her to grab on to the tow rope.
Okay, I was freezing.
You were freaked.
No, Sean, my eyelashes were cracking off.
She says to me... "S-s-Sean,
C-can you c-carry me down, p-please?"
And I'm like, "Babe, I'm right next to you.
You'll be fine."
Oh, her trusty St. Bernard.
You can snowplow the whole way down.
"And if you fall, I'll drag you back to the bus
and get you drunk so I can lick your face."
What did you say?
I mean, so what if they're lousy guard dogs?
They're big and they're goofy,
and if you can get past buckets of drool...
I think hermie the hermaphrodite needs a jumbo coffee.
I mean, who does not want a big, slobbering beast
who can catch a ball in the end zone?
That's it.
Fight, fight, fight!
Don't hit him!
Sean! Sean! Stop!
It's like fighting a kid that needs a telethon.
Lucas,
Can I please talk to you outside?
What's his deal?
Lucas, did you come here to welcome me home
Or to pick a fight with Sean?
Hey, it's not my fault some people are trapped
between Neanderthal and Cro-magnon.
H-he is not the one that you're angry at.
You came here to get back at me.
Breaking news, princess.
Not everything is about you.
Well, then why did you cut me off?
I wasn't the one who did the cutting, remember?
I want to be your friend, Lucas, but I just--
No! You people just think you can push me around
like some kind of mop! And you're no different!
You're no different from the rest of Alison's anointed!
What?
You let her march around
and act like some 17th-century torture squads,
And considering what that bitch did to me,
I should have done way worse to her!
What are you talking about?
What did you do to Alison?
Dying doesn't make you a Saint.
Not when you spent all of junior high being a monster.
Do you know what it's like
to walk through this town every single day
and look at some shrine to her?
That was you who destroyed the memorial?
You can call the cops.
Tell them to meet me in my driveway.
It will take me 11 minutes to walk home.
Lucas, I'm not gonna call the cops.
I think that we can keep this between us.
You've already been through enough already.
Don't. Stop.
Please.
Don't make me like you.
It's too hard.
Is he gone?
You shouldn't be alone with him.
That kid is cracked.
Yeah, well, anyone can surprise you.
Who are we talking about?
You and Noel are best buds, right?
How well do you really know him?
Oh, I get it.
Your friend's a certified loony tune,
So now you want to pick on mine?
Sean, everyone's got a life that no one else knows about.
I mean, who is Noel when he's not with you?
Hanna, you're freaking me out.
Why don't you just come inside and try to have some fun.
You know, people are asking all about--
You know what? Just tell them to go home.
Okay?
I just want everyone to go home.
You need to call Alex.
And tell him what?
I can't undo this without telling him about "A."
Unless you think I should go into the kitchen
And ask "A" to put down the piece of pizza and call Alex himself.
Stop.
We don't know that Noel is that person.
And besides, I'm not even sure what "A" Wants anymore.
Are you?
You know what happens when you stick four lobsters
In a tank and cut off their food supply?
They start to eat each other.
Can I get to the bathroom?
Is there a magic password?
Okay, if we find out that he is
who we think he is,
then what are we prepared to do about it?
You hungry?
No.
You never told me that Emily tried to talk to me.
Why would I?
What can she say now that's gonna make it better?
She wasn't the one that turned me in.
I know that.
How?
Because I did.
Look, Toby,
If you're running around like you're some kind of fugitive,
How are you gonna prove that you're innocent?
You need to be home...
...where you're safe.
You could chain me to this porch,
and I'd still never touch you like that again.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Hello?
Is someone there?
Hello?
Is someone upstairs?
Damn it!
God!
Oh, God!
What happened in here?
I-I thought that someone... was in here.
Yeah.
Looks like a lot more than someone. You had a party?
Mona invited people over. I had no idea.
Hi. How was the party?
Uh, just okay.
Hanna wasn't really in the party mode.
Well, can you blame her?
That girl doesn't need any more surprises
for at least a couple of years, right?
Is dad sleeping?
You know what? After you left, he got a phone call.
The commander wants him in Texas by the end of the month.
This month? Why? He just got home.
I know, Emily. It's not his decision.
There's just a bigger picture.
Tonight meant a lot to me.
Thank you.
Maya had a great time.
Your father thinks she's very sweet.
She is.
And I'm glad you're okay with it.
I'm not okay with it.
The whole thing makes me sick.
Sick to my stomach.
Hey, dad.
Hey, Spence.
Didn't even know you were here.
I would have watched the game downstairs with you.
Your mother makes me watch it on mute.
Just got home.
He's got a lot of stuff, Ian.
Yeah.
Suddenly he's, uh, everywhere, isn't he?
Well, maybe it'll inspire your sister to finish that condo
so they can move in.
Dad...
They might never move out of here.
Melissa loves the barn.
Yeah, well, Melissa's always needed a little nudge every once in a while.
That's why your mother thinks Ian is so good for her.
He's "Impulsive" And, uh, "Passionate."
You don't agree?
I have a few other choice words I would reserve for Ian,
But if I start listing them, I'll never fall asleep.
I spoke to a friend of mine on the police force tonight.
The bloodstain they found on that sweater at Toby Cavanaugh's
was a positive match.
I don't think that kid's
gonna be around much longer to scare you.
It's Alison's blood?
Um... does that mean it's done?
They're not going to investigate anyone else?
I thought you'd be relieved.
Don't stay up too late, okay?
水上天堂度假村
My God, I missed you guys so much!
Why are you so tan?
How did you get so sun-kissed sitting
in your grandma's apartment?
I thought she was, like, bedridden, in a cave.
Doesn't mean I was.
So, are we still on for tonight, ladies?
Totally. Spencer's mom said
that we could use their barn.
Yeah, but there might be a major storm tonight,
so I don't know if--
It's the last blowout before school starts, Han.
Don't bring me down.
Hey, can one of you guys get those?
My arms are really sore.
Yeah. Why?
Did you have to, like, lift your grandma and bathe her?
Yeah. It was really disgusting.
Did you go to Hilton head?
Oh, yeah. Nana had a day out,
And she's really into golf.
Don't ask.
So, who's in charge of refreshments?
Hanna stole a bottle of Tequila.
Genius. Good job, han.
Hold onto those baggy sweaters.
Isn't Hilton Head in South Carolina?
I thought your grandma lived in Georgia.
It's still the South, Spence.
Why so many questions?
Guys, we've got a long night ahead of us.
I can't spill every detail the minute I hit the curb.
Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait for it.
Spence, don't forget to turn off the yard lights, okay?
水上天堂度假村
Maybe I should call Sean.
You know, maybe he saw somebody--
Don't... talk anymore.
Please.
Will any of those help you sleep?
Pink one.
Will any of 'em help me sleep?
Thank you.
I'll get your bed ready.
Mom...
Take your medicine, Hanna. Tomorrow's another day.
