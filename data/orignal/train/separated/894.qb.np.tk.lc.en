back in the &apos; 80s ,
i saw the movie &quot; princess bride &quot; 237 times .
not just because it was andre the giant &apos;s greatest performance ,
it had magic , adventure , romance ,
rodents of unusual size ,
and the greatest one @-@ liners of all time .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
it wasn &apos;t enough to just watch &quot; the princess bride . &quot;
i had to experience it .
then why are you smiling ?
then why are you smiling ?
&apos;cause i know something you don &apos;t know .
because i know something you don &apos;t know .
i am not left @-@ handed .
there &apos;s something i ought to tell you .
i &apos;m not left @-@ handed , either .
screw wrapping paper .
we need some real swords , dude .
can &apos;t you ask your mom ? she never says no to you .
sure , dave kim .
let me ask my safety @-@ crazed mother for a deadly weapon .
get your head in the game , dude .
maybe you could ask your dad .
please . he hates movies .
all he cares about are sports and bread products .
wait .
that &apos;s it .
yes . good .
fill your mouth with that delicious buttered bagel i made you .
while i &apos;m here , i wanted to ask for a little favor .
no .
imagine a world
where you can live out your dream of having an athletic son
instead of a triple @-@ threat theater force . no .
well , that world can be yours for just $ 250 .
no .
&apos;cause with your help ...
no - .... i can become --
you &apos;re gonna love this -- - no !
an olympic @-@ class fencer .
seriously ?
of all sports , you pick the one with a pointy sword ?
you know how your mom &apos;s crazy about eye safety . crazy !
please . fencing is my dream .
i thought your dream was to be cast as an ewok .
i &apos;m too big now . things change .
just give me what i want .
pops , the voice of reason .
help me out here , will you ?
come on , murray .
don &apos;t be such a grump and let the kid do it already .
you just walked in . you don &apos;t even know what we &apos;re talking about .
well , i know the first thing you always say is no .
is that what happened here ? he said no ?
the moron wants to fence .
i &apos;ll spend a fortune on equipment ,
and he &apos;ll quit after the first match .
you know , this reminds me of a little story .
please don &apos;t tell me a story .
i &apos;m gonna tell you a story .
when bevy was a girl ,
all she wanted was to be a ballerina .
sadly , she was a very early bloomer .
the other little girls would keep a wide berth around her
so if she lost her balance ,
they wouldn &apos;t be crushed beneath her enormous girl body .
point is , watching her dance
is one of the happiest memories of my life .
don &apos;t you want to have that with your son ?
why do you always have to tell such wonderful and touching crap ?
fine .
if this is really your dream , i &apos;ll buy you the sword .
yes !
i &apos;m gonna be like luke skywalker .
scratch that . i &apos;m gonna be like ...
name an athlete who &apos;s really good at sports .
michael jordan .
michael jordan !
just poked my eye .
oh . it &apos;s okay .
i got glasses . they protected me .
it was april 22 , 1980 @-@ something .
a typical day for my mom --
power walking and being a yenta .
you won &apos;t believe what i heard about gabe and melinda finkleman .
trial separation .
what ? ! is he moving out ?
no , he &apos;s moving into the room above their garage
like fonzie , only this time it &apos;s not cool .
a yenta is a nickname for the world &apos;s most intrusive ,
loose @-@ lipped gossip monger .
they &apos;re the busiest of busybodies
who have a talent for making your business their business .
don &apos;t look .
ginny .
it &apos;s linda holman .
her son brian is going to cornell ,
but the twin , craig , is spending the year traveling abroad
so he can &quot; find himself . &quot;
translation -- he &apos;s got a problem with reefer .
oh . so sad .
a good yenta can dish anytime , anywhere .
yeah , it &apos;s amazing how marsha &apos;s surgery for sleep apnea
left her so top @-@ heavy .
you know what i mean ?
please !
i need to talk to someone from the outside world .
but most importantly , a yenta is an expert matchmaker .
miss cinoman ! miss cinoman , allow me .
why , thank you , coach mellor .
please . call me coach rick .
well , look at those two .
they seem to be getting along nicely .
don &apos;t even think about it .
think about what now ?
you cannot set up mellor and miss cinoman , understand ?
that &apos;s a guaranteed disaster for us .
disaster !
how can bringing together two like @-@ minded , single adults
over chablis and assorted cheeses
possibly turn into a disaster for you ?
coach is my coach , and whenever he feels feelings ,
he makes us run laps until we feel them , too .
and miss cinoman is my music teacher .
spring fling is next week , and i have a solo .
don &apos;t be you and ruin this .
go !
put your foot on the gas and push .
well , this is very hurtful .
as much as my mom wanted to do right by erica and barry ,
there was no way she could curb her meddling
when the perfect match was just around the corner .
coach mellor ! hey , it &apos;s beverly goldberg !
meanwhile , all i had to do was throw one match ,
and this fencing sword would become my awesome movie prop .
go get &apos; em , pal . no worries .
just do your best out there .
listen , i &apos;m kind of running a grift on my old man ,
so what do you say we give him a good show
and i &apos;ll be on my merry way ?
is your dad like a bad dude or something ?
is there always this much talking before these things ?
let &apos;s just do this , bro .
okay , so maybe it was wrong to screw over my dad ,
but i wanted to be inigo montoya ,
and this was the least painful way .
oh ! oh , no ! oh , no !
oh , god ! why ? !
or so i thought .
cut it off of me ! cut the glove off of me !
intermission . i call intermission .
while my dad &apos;s hope for a connection with me
took a big hit ,
my mom was hoping for a love connection .
beverly , thank you so much for your generous donation
of unique sweaters for the holiday concert .
oh , it &apos;s my pleasure .
oh , well , i wonder who that could be
at this late and sexy hour , huh ?
how you doing , mrs. g ?
i &apos;m here for that large donation of sports balls .
of course . come on in .
uh , did you , uh , jog here ?
you seem overheated .
if you ain &apos;t running , you ain &apos;t living .
susan .
coach rick .
do you two know each other ?
are you kidding me ?
work at william penn academy and not know susan cinoman
is like looking at a spice rack
and not knowing actual cinnamon .
rick is well @-@ regarded at school
for both his mind and his body .
i can &apos;t believe i just said that .
ah , please .
that &apos;s why i eat six pounds of fish every single day .
feeds both .
well , speaking of eating , uh , would you like to just sit back
and enjoy this open bottle of wine and beautiful cheese plate ?
sure .
rick , perhaps you &apos;d like to ask susan something
about herself , like , um ...
oh , did you know she used to live in florida ?
i do have many questions for susan .
are you from florida ?
tampa .
i have a sports background , too .
i grew up racing greyhound dogs .
you must be incredibly fast .
i can tell by the size of your calves
you got a lot of explosion .
oh , no .
i raced them against other dogs .
oh . okay .
but no one &apos;s ever said that about my calves before .
yeah , well , i &apos;m saying it right now .
there it was .
another perfect match made by a world @-@ class yenta ,
much to the dismay of the yenta &apos;s children .
i &apos;m sorry , dad .
i just had to bow out gracefully .
i wouldn &apos;t call that bowing out gracefully .
you made the referee carry you to the car .
she was a strong lady .
she was a strong lady .
but the good news is , is i learned a lot today --
mostly , swords hurt when they jab your body ,
which is why i &apos;ve decided to retire from the game .
in time , i know we &apos;ll both be glad i gave this a shot .
i have to admit
that your story about bevy dancing gave me hope .
for a second , i thought that me and adam
actually found something that we both enjoyed .
you know , this reminds me of a story .
oh , dear god .
i &apos;ll work through it on my own .
yep .
i brilliantly played my dad to get a sword .
even little bald vizzini
would &apos;ve called my plan inconceivable !
dude ! these swords are badass .
how &apos;d you get them ?
simple .
i used my dad &apos;s love of sports
and the awkwardness of our relationship to get what i wanted .
wow . behind the mask and glasses lies a devious mind .
all right , adam and boy whose name i can &apos;t remember .
give me the swords .
wait , what ? why ?
you quit , so i &apos;m returning them .
but they &apos;re used .
i spoke to the manager at herman &apos;s sports .
he &apos;s a total hard @-@ ass . he won &apos;t take them back .
it &apos;s store policy , ironclad .
no , i got some divorced dad at school
who wants to buy them to earn back his son &apos;s love ,
so hand them over .
but i need them .
i mean ... i have some big news .
you see , i found an even better use
for expensive sporting equipment .
imagination .
oh , i see what &apos;s going on here .
you played me .
what ? !
you played me .
don &apos;t insult me like that .
you used my love of sports
and the awkwardness of our relationship
to get what you wanted .
well , i wouldn &apos;t use those words exactly .
you literally did a minute ago .
shut up , dave kim !
my name is dave kim , by the way .
while i had let my dad down ,
my mom was celebrating the perfect setup .
i did it , ginny .
they stayed past 11 : 00 and she drove him home ,
partly because he jogged to our house ,
but partly because they wanted private time .
wow . how do you do it , bev ?
well , i just know that opposites attract .
i mean , she &apos;s creative and artistic ,
and he likes to wear short shorts in the winter .
wow . well , you are just a matchmaking wizard .
i know .
but you can &apos;t tell anyone .
i would never .
this is so juicy .
i know . but you cannot tell a soul .
i would never .
the only problem was that my mom was just a single part
of an intricate web of gossiping moms .
long before the internet , there was the world wide yenta @-@ net .
it was faster than erica and barry could &apos;ve ever imagined .
yo !
dude ! did you hear ?
miss cinoman and mellor are doing the wild thing .
i heard they hooked up in the pool and now they have to drain it .
oh , god , no . where &apos;d you hear that ?
everyone &apos;s talking about it .
apparently they got busy in the band room
and now they got to throw away all the oboes .
oh , this is bad .
your dopey friends have the biggest mouths in school .
no , no , no , they &apos;re cool .
i promise you it &apos;s not as bad as we think .
everybody stop your gossiping !
nobody wants to hear about susan cinoman
mashing parts with that neanderthal .
get to class .
yeah , it &apos;s bad .
it &apos;s come to my attention
that there &apos;s been some ... inappropriate behavior
with members of our faculty .
i am offended to my very core
that my integrity would be questioned .
we kissed !
coach rick .
it absolutely happened .
big time .
i actually have a question .
why am i here ?
you are here because you caused this kerfuffle .
now , i don &apos;t want to mention any names ,
but there is another faculty member that has complained ,
and our school &apos;s bylaws state teachers can &apos;t fraternize .
love don &apos;t care about bylaws .
that is beautiful , coach .
what ... he just said doesn &apos;t mean anything .
ok , one of the two of you
is going to have to take a leave of absence .
if someone must go , then let it be me .
i will be the one who goes gently into that good night .
hooray , it &apos;s settled . so , cinoman &apos;s out , mellor &apos;s in .
silver lining .
now we can go make out in the supply closet
without fear of punishment .
no . still not okay .
being an all @-@ knowing yenta , my mom knew exactly
who complained about her matchmaking .
it was this man .
the lonely and bitter mr. woodburn .
the only solution -- find a match for him , too .
59 cents worth of noodles down the drain .
if anybody could get it done , it was beverly goldberg .
can &apos;t be done .
while my mother was determined to open mr. woodburn &apos;s heart ,
i was determined to open my dad &apos;s eyes
to &quot; the princess bride . &quot;
look , i know i manipulated you
into spending hundreds of your hard @-@ earned dollars
on swords to re @-@ create an epic movie scene ,
and for that , i &apos;d like to say my mistake .
oh ! well , as long as it &apos;s your mistake , all is forgiven .
i can sense your sarcasm ,
but i think once you see that movie ,
you &apos;ll be so freaking delighted
that you &apos;ll have no choice but to forgive me .
i &apos;m not watching that damn movie .
do you like romance , pirates ,
wizards , mandy patinkin ?
that &apos;s a hard no to all those things .
but what i do like is my money well spent ,
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna force you to fence .
but i &apos;ll get poked again , and it stings a little !
pops , you &apos;re the voice of reason .
help me out here .
not after the way you manipulated your father , kiddo .
that was a real putz move .
look , i can &apos;t fence .
i have absolutely no idea what i &apos;m doing .
lucky for you ,
i got a way you can learn everything about everything .
the encyclopedia ? that &apos;s your brilliant answer ?
yes . &quot; f &quot; for fencing .
now learn , damn it .
yep , back before google and wikipedia ,
the only way to look stuff up
was a set of really boring books that covered a lot ,
but said a little .
there , fencing . you &apos;re welcome .
there &apos;s just a small paragraph .
i &apos;ll learn nothing from this .
&quot; z &quot; for zorro . he was a great fence man .
oh , please , zorro sucks .
don &apos;t you dare knock zorro ! he is a man of honor .
then why is he wearing that stupid mask ?
what &apos;s he hiding ?
all i &apos;m saying is
zorro had enough skill to sign a &quot; z &quot; wherever he went .
a &quot; z &quot; !
even i can sign a &quot; z . &quot;
oh , i &apos;d like to see that .
gladly .
what &apos;d you do that for ? !
don &apos;t just stand there !
we &apos;re in &quot; f . &quot; find &quot; first aid . &quot;
oh , you moron !
while my dad was feeling the pain of my blade ,
miss cinoman was gone ,
and to coach , that was as stab in the heart .
hustle up , goldberg ! pick up the pace !
coach , are you crying ?
you only get one cry in life , son , and this ain &apos;t it .
now run till your heart explodes ,
&apos;cause ... mine just did .
as coach mellor was barely holding it together ,
the school choir had completely fallen apart
without miss cinoman .
now ... i know you &apos;re all wondering what qualifications
does your principal have to teach you music ?
well , rest assured , i was a baritone
in my high @-@ school barbershop quartet , the dapper dougs .
isn &apos;t your name earl ?
yes , but we had a doug and he was very assertive .
sorry .
now , match my pitch .
* i don &apos;t hear any singing *
* let &apos;s go @-@ o @-@ o @-@ o *
no , you &apos;re down here .
* i &apos;m up here *
* you &apos;re down here *
* you &apos;re a girl i &apos;m a bo @-@ o @-@ y *
* you &apos;re a principal *
* what makes you qualified to teach music ? *
no offense
no offense taken
* but i would be very careful about that attitude *
* it leads you down to a very dangerous path *
your yenta @-@ ing has ruined our lives .
coach mellor cancelled our next wrestling match .
he said without love , what &apos;s the point of sports ?
i lost my solo .
even worse , i &apos;m the bass in a barbershop quartet .
principal ball chose me over matt ramer ,
and he &apos;s a dude , a big dude .
okay .
i admit i may have over @-@ yenta &apos;d , and for that , i &apos;m sorry .
but lucky for you ,
your mama &apos;s already in the kitchen cooking up a plan .
she had a plan , all right .
okay , what have we got , people ?
and that plan was to find love for my jealous science teacher .
leads for woodburn . talk to me .
we &apos;re thinking edna bishop .
engaged . next .
betty garellick .
engaged . next .
ruth applebaum !
moved to jersey . come on .
i think i might know someone .
who ?
her name is gail kaufman .
she works with me at gimbels .
she &apos;s super clumsy and dresses in primary brown
and always talks about her pet lizard .
but more than anything , i just get the feeling
they would really like each other , you know ?
i do know .
oh , and she doesn &apos;t have a ring .
how do i even know that ?
because all yentas know .
oh , my god . you &apos;re one of them !
oh , don &apos;t you dare say that .
but it &apos;s true .
oh , schmoopie , i &apos;m so proud of you !
don &apos;t be proud . &apos; cause i &apos;m not a yenta .
don &apos;t be ashamed . it &apos;s a gift .
how &apos;s your throat skin ?
you , uh , stabbed it with a sword , so it feels like that .
here , you can sell this .
i &apos;m sorry i lied and stuff .
it &apos;s fine . this whole thing was a mess .
i guess i was just excited about the overlap .
the what ?
the overlap .
you know , you like dumb movies , i like awesome sports ,
and this fencing thing was finally something
we could both enjoy ...
at least i thought it was .
he was right .
this was no longer about some silly sword .
it was about sharing something with my dad ,
and i had to fix it .
dad ?
yeah .
maybe i could give it one more try .
honestly , you don &apos;t have to .
i do .
and you know what ? i might even surprise you .
and so , i set out to become like every brave warrior
who ever wielded a sword .
the time had come to be a real hero ,
not just play one from a movie .
sadly , fighting for real was way harder
than the stage combat class i took at theater camp .
you won , gosh dang it !
it was 4 @-@ 0 , and if i was gonna win this match ,
i &apos;d need more than an encyclopedia .
i needed a miracle .
thank god .
pops , just the man i wanted to see .
tell me what to do .
hey , look , you got a nickel in your face mask .
not the nickel trick now !
i got stabbed in the face .
i need advice -- real life @-@ saving advice .
adam , let &apos;s just go home .
you &apos;ll do your &quot; princess bride &quot; thing .
of course . that was my answer --
the very movie that brought me here in the first place .
just like inigo montoya ,
i &apos;d rise up and fight in the name of my father !
&quot; the princess bride . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
back for more ?
hello . my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father . prepare to die .
what now ?
hello . my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father . prepare to die .
dude , what is your deal ?
hello . my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father . prepare to die .
your father is right there .
he sold us our sectional .
attaboy , kiddo !
my son &apos;s gonna be in the olympics !
in the olympics !
i wasn &apos;t ,
but i was still a champion to my dad .
* each morning i get up i die a little *
* can barely stand on my feet *
* take a look at yourself *
and even though erica refused to admit she was a yenta ...
she got her solo back thanks to the matchmaking skills
she learned from my mom .
erica , thank you for telling me about the big sale ...
on brown pants and shirts .
of course .
could i get my co @-@ worker to help you ? i &apos;m kind of slammed today .
gail , would you mind helping my friend here find some slacks ?
hi .
i bet you &apos;d be interested to know
gail here has a giant lizard .
emerald tree or spiny @-@ tailed ?
i &apos;ll tell you all about it while you try on some corduroys .
okay .
okay .
this way .
schmoopie .
oh , no .
no proud hugs .
i &apos;m not a yenta .
not even a little yenta ?
do you want to hide in a dressing room
so we can hear what they &apos;re talking about ?
we &apos;ll stop by housewares
and get a glass to press against the wall .
move , move , move .
once mr. woodburn had conveniently
met his perfect match ,
he didn &apos;t care so much about miss cinoman and coach rick .
and that &apos;s the power of the yenta .
despite the gossip and meddling ...
... all they really want is to find each single person
somebody to love .
coach , are you crying ?
you only get one cry in life , son , and this is it .
can we stop running now ?
* till the tears run down from my eyes , lord *
even though i grew up in a small town ...
we still had our fair share of adventure and romance .
and while my dad wasn &apos;t much for either ...
we still managed to find our overlap .
&apos;cause that &apos;s the thing about family .
sometimes they demand a lot , but you love them so much ...
... you can &apos;t help but give in and say , &quot; as you wish . &quot;
dad , what are you ...
i , uh , watched the movie , and it &apos;s not bad .
okay , let &apos;s , uh , get this over with .
okay . so , come over here .
stand right there and try and look enormous .
there we go .
helen schur says her son is working on wall street .
i just saw him bagging groceries at walmart .
i need the phone !
you &apos;ve literally been on it for seven hours !
i &apos;m telling you , dottie anderson &apos;s leg
100 % wood .
4 carats my ass , linda schwartz .
we all know she &apos;s sporting a cubic z.
they don &apos;t own that house .
they &apos;re renters .
you said that . you said that .
