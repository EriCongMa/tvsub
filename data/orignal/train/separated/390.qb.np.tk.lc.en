放马过来吧
now pull it in , run it back . let &apos;s go .
come on .
i gotcha .
on swat , we broke shots down into 3 steps .
one @-@ front sight .
focus on the front sight , not on the target .
2- controlled trigger press .
3- follow through .
after the shot , you come right back to the target .
now what did you do wrong ?
i didn &apos;t follow through .
right . you came off the target to see where you hit .
hotch , my firearms qualification is tomorrow morning .
i barely passed my last one .
front sight , trigger press ...
follow through .
you do those 3 things , you &apos;ll hit your target every time .
i &apos;m not fallin &apos; for it .
come on , pop .
stop playing .
oh , my god .
dad !
did elle teach you that ?
they &apos;re gonna take away my gun .
a profiler is not required to carry .
yeah ? and yet you carry 2 of them .
吉迪恩告诉我
&quot; you don &apos;t have to carry a gun to kill someone . &quot;
i don &apos;t get it .
you will .
good luck tomorrow .
reid failed his qualification .
he can re @-@ test in 2 weeks .
yeah , but he &apos;s gonna be embarrassed about it , so let &apos;s not mention it .
yeah , let &apos;s not .
not a word .
we &apos;re all here for you .
i &apos;m serious .
if you ever need anything ...
just blow on that .
德斯普兰斯的弗兰克林公园
3 victims shot at distance .
it &apos;s the third such shooting in 2 weeks .
a sniper ?
we don &apos;t use that word .
why not ?
the public perception is that the fbi
doesn &apos;t have an exemplary record with snipers .
这些人显然不是
what do we call &apos; em then ?
l.d.s.k.
long distance serial killers .
how many of these guys have we caught using a profile ?
none .
六名受害人都是腹部中枪
也是唯一一名死者亨利 · 萨克斯
married , father of 3,
was shot in a shopping center parking lot .
9 days later ,
在社区中心打篮球时遇害
franklin park , 4 days later ,
凯特 · 默里和蒂姆 · 赖利
在受害人间未发现任何关联
ballistics ?
击中时会爆炸为碎片
making ballistics comparisons impossible .
the good news is that all the park victims are gonna make it .
the bad new is that none of them saw anything .
留下了一颗完整的子弹
what &apos;s the prognosis ?
there &apos;s a disagreement among surgical staff
前提下取出子弹
well , without a useful witness or a solid piece of forensic evidence ...
the profile &apos;s all we &apos;ll have .
nietzsche wrote ,
&quot; the irrationality of a thing
&quot; is not an argument against it &apos;s existence ,
rather , a condition of it . &quot;
l.d.s.k.s are so rare ,
we haven &apos;t been able to build a standard profile .
here &apos;s what we do know : they &apos;re always male ,
and they frequently have law enforcement or military experience ,
and they always contact the police or the media .
to take credit or relive the experience ?
both .
都试图重温杀戮的快感
some use souvenirs taken from the victims ,
and others return to the dump site to interact with the body .
both modes require contact with the victim ,
对于远距射击连环杀手并不存在
留下了一张塔罗牌
由此终落法网
but our unsub hasn &apos;t contacted anybody .
he will .
我们现在掌握什么情况
根据不明嫌犯的所为而作
sometimes it is what they do not do .
he doesn &apos;t kill his victims .
underkill &apos;s a unique signature .
the question is ,
是否只是为伤害他们
or is he just aiming at the biggest part of the target ?
不明嫌犯是枪法不好才不选择爆头
or simply the will to take it ?
agent hotchner .
这位是摩根探员和里德探员
thanks for comin &apos; . follow me .
the cones mark the places where the victims were .
so we know he fired from somewhere in this area .
close enough to hit all 3 victims ,
but far away enough not to be seen .
his wounding his victims intentionally
would classify him as a sadistic killer .
that would help us ?
we know a lot about sadists .
以便看清受害人的痛苦状
在安全范围观察一切了
so how do we determine if he &apos;s a sadist ?
用换位思考分析他
we let him tell us .
come on , barry , you don &apos;t know that !
good morning , doctors .
forgive us . we were just reviewing the cases at hand .
尼尔 · 尔斯塔奇医生
and our trauma specialist , dr. barry landman .
詹若和格凌威探员
how are you ?
forgive me . i don &apos;t shake .
my hands , you understand ?
of course .
so as psychological profilers , what exactly are you looking for ?
how the victims were shot .
that could reveal the shooter &apos;s signature behavior .
碎片又向不同方向炸开
you can see the trauma &apos;s extensive .
you performed the surgeries ?
on patient miller .
是跟兰德曼医生讨论的
the intact slug lodged between the l4 @-@ l5 vertebrae .
病人很可能就瘫痪了
in your opinion .
in my opinion .
disagree ?
with the right surgeon , there is no risk .
there &apos;s always risk .
what significance does the bullet have in building a profile ?
well , even if we can &apos;t get a ballistics match ,
we can get a rifle type ,
and the specific type of rifle the suspect uses ,
that could be very significant to the profile .
兰德曼医生
i know i can .
this handicapped spot couldn &apos;t be
further away from the entrance to the building .
yeah ?
正好包括了3个受害者和旗杆
what are you thinkin &apos; ?
at this range , the unsub would have to factor in
wind direction and speed as he shot .
to do this , he needed a spot
with the widest field of fire
从而推断风力如何影响每次射击
he came here before the shooting ,
decided this was his spot ...
and ensured that it would be empty when he came back .
my guess is he &apos;s shooting from his car .
well , that would mean he wanted to get away from here quickly ,
that he didn &apos;t stick around to watch his victims suffer .
so he would not be a sadist .
what would he be ?
a very smart , very resourceful , very paranoid sociopath .
if i &apos;m the unsub ,
到3点15之间开枪伤人
that &apos;s when i &apos;d do it . there are fewer cops on the street .
那时街上警察最少
why is that ?
以保证始终有人在执勤
第一班3点半才结束
wouldn &apos;t there be twice as many cops on the street at that time ?
in theory .
最初半小时需要点名
you &apos;re not on the street .
and the last half @-@ hour , you &apos;re at the station .
you &apos;re finishin &apos; reports , you &apos;re booking prisoners ,
so the 25 minutes around the first / second shift ,
that &apos;s a bad guy &apos;s golden window .
how many people outside law enforcement would know that ?
而你已经想到了这点
i had considered it .
hope you find it useful .
dr. landman ?
how &apos;s mr. middleton .
patient will make a full recovery ...
radiology is set up to take photos
and e @-@ mail them out for consults .
我们得把子弹交给加西亚
fill him in on the shift change theory .
give me a second .
yeah . morgan .
isn &apos;t this spooky ?
isn &apos;t what spooky ?
that right now you were thinking about me ,
and out of the blue , your phone rings ?
and it &apos;s me . huh ?
how &apos;s that for a spiritual connection ?
um ... do i know you ?
why do you hurt me ?
告诉我你确定了嫌犯的地理侧写吧
ok , i &apos;ll give you the good news first ,
which is not that good , but it &apos;s better than the bad .
执法部门内部的工作程序
detective calvin ,
how far out of your jurisdiction was crime scene number 2 ?
为什么问这个
if he knew how difficult it is
for local police departments to interact with each other ,
he may have intentionally crossed jurisdiction lines .
y &apos;all are sayin &apos; the shooter &apos;s a cop .
we &apos;re saying it &apos;s a possibility .
进行侦察并做好准备
he chose and elevated position with excellent enfilade
and perfect field of fire .
that &apos;s textbook military practice .
true .
yeah , but maybe he was in the army .
或是其他特种部队
属于m @-@ 16枪的变型m @-@ 4
all the services use an m @-@ 4 .
it &apos;s got a shorter barrel than the m @-@ 16 .
而且射击的难度更大
especially at these distances .
他曾受过专业训练
if he has specialized training ,
he knows exactly what he &apos;s doing .
he intended to wound them .
the underkill is deliberate .
everything he does is deliberate ,
他自己有多聪明
since the crime scenes aren &apos;t centered around one single location ,
加西亚无法完成地理侧写
what kind of data ?
more crime scenes .
she &apos;s gonna get &apos; em .
this guy &apos;s got something to prove .
how did it play out ?
he &apos;s been suspended
but my guess is that the school board &apos;s gonna go after him ,
and they &apos;re gonna try to expel him .
i don &apos;t feel very good .
i &apos;m gonna go to the ladies &apos; room , ok ?
ok .
honey , you have something on your dress .
three more victims with nonfatal wounds ,
and it &apos;s only been 48 hours since the last shooting .
the media attention and the fbi presence
will only escalate his desire to shoot again .
meaning ?
this is gonna get much worse .
then we need to give the police a profile immediately .
you ready ?
state troopers .
this is the second time he &apos;s crossed jurisdictions .
但他们不会喜欢的
this initial profile is not ready to be given to the media .
releasing this profile prematurely can get people killed .
we &apos;re looking for a 30 to 40 @-@ year @-@ old male veteran ,
又不至于大到引人注意
可能是一辆经改装的轿车
还有射击时发出的声音
the unsub suffers from both narcissistic and paranoid personality disorders .
he works out obsessively and is never without a weapon .
he &apos;s completely self @-@ centered and cannot empathize with others .
incapable of admitting fault ,
he blames his shortcomings on those around him .
he has no friends ,
and his career history has been marked by frequent job changes .
为的是向低估了他的世人
to a world he perceives has undervalued him ,
就是他需求的最终表现形式
we believe he changes jurisdictions intentionally
and strikes during the first / second shift change ,
indicating and intimate knowledge of law enforcement .
you &apos;re saying he &apos;s one of us .
或者现在是一个警察
is he driving a white van , too ?
enough .
that &apos;ll be all for now .
we can talk in my office .
thank you .
sergeant weigart , we would like to
reenact the third shooting during the shift change .
why ?
well , to better understand his m.o.
how does he get there ? how does he leave ?
what &apos;s the traffic like ?
it could help us with witnesses .
maybe the victims or bystanders saw something ,
but don &apos;t realize the significance of what they saw .
all right , let &apos;s do it .
how you holdin &apos; up ?
look at me . without a gun on my belt , i look like a teacher &apos;s assistant .
you &apos;re not worried about how you look .
hotch told me that when he came to the bau ,
you told him he didn &apos;t need a gun to kill somebody ?
well , the only truly effective weapon we have
is our ability to do the one thing they can &apos;t .
which is what ?
empathize .
我们对凶手人性关怀
you &apos;re just saying that to convince me i don &apos;t need to carry a gun .
i don &apos;t care you carry a gun or not .
是一份精确而完备的犯罪行为分析
of course you believe that .
footpath killer , he had a shotgun in the back of my head .
i &apos;m here , he &apos;s not .
elle , jerry middleton was facing a little further south .
can you give us that ?
how &apos;s that ?
perfect . hold your camera right there .
it doesn &apos;t look like jerry middleton had a clear view
没有很清晰的视野
the tree branches were in the way .
i do have a clear view of the vehicle from here .
也能一览无余
good . have the unsub pop the trunk .
see if reid can see it .
no , sorry .
nothing from position one .
ok , everyone , move to position 2 .
约翰 · 詹金斯那里
reporting live from franklin park
with breaking news on the sniper investigation .
you gotta see this .
已告知警方特遣部队
德斯普兰斯警方的一员
who could have leaked this ?
the only people who had the profile were your people .
and the profile implicates them .
why would a cop leak sensitive information
that would not only implicate one of his own ,
but make every citizen in the county
afraid to get pulled over ?
what does he get out of it ?
contact with the media .
what ?
the cop who leaked this story is a good suspect .
闹下去的一种变态手段
vic , why don &apos;t you go ahead and call the station
and find out what they &apos;ve got in mind for one of the later shows .
mr. jenkins ,
i &apos;m special agent jennifer jareau with the fbi .
we need you to identify your source .
no way . i know my rights .
hey , hey , shoot this . vic , shoot this . get this all on tape .
把这些枪击案视为恐怖袭击
我们想扣押你多久都行
all i know is his cell number .
we have a lead .
rainmaker . how wet do you want it ?
it &apos;s hotch . i have a cell phone number ,
and i need the name on the account .
实时的地址 免费服务
are you ready ?
i was born ready .
can &apos;t you pull your people out of the park ?
if we do and the shooter is here ,
he &apos;ll sense something is wrong .
he could start shooting .
批量购买的其中之一
i need a name , garcia .
我得从他们系统里调出来
then give me the location .
franklin park , des plaines .
he &apos;s here .
the name , garcia .
mccarty , scott .
scott mccarty .
mccarty &apos;s the unsub .
teah . where is he ?
mccarty is playing the unsub .
we need to talk to scott mccarty .
he &apos;s the leak .
mccarty . why am i not surprised ?
i need swat in the lot asap .
it &apos;s mccarty . we need to come heavy .
we didn &apos;t say he was the shooter .
让他到这来
best case , he leaked the story .
我不能让他放倒任何我的人
we come heavy , and we take him clean .
this is mccarty . what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
把双手伸出车外
i don &apos;t understand .
we know what you did , scotty .
look , i can explain .
don &apos;t make me give the order !
ok , all right ! all right !
now open the trunk lid slowly .
come on .
that &apos;s it .
everything is secure .
get him up .
get down !
how did mccarty end up playing the unsub ?
在侧写简报时多嘴
during the profile briefing by making him the unsub
and sticking him in the trunk of the car all afternoon .
这次模拟的
come on . cops talk .
pissed @-@ off cops talk loud-
唯恐天下不知
what do we know ?
our unsub went from wounding civilians
to executing a police officer ,
so he &apos;s escalated .
he &apos;s not staying on script .
sometimes it &apos;s what they don &apos;t do .
he did not pick mccarty at random .
he didn &apos;t take the gut shot .
why ?
he wants to send a message .
&quot; nobody takes credit for my work . &quot;
yes , sir . his ego won &apos;t allow it .
he feels underappreciated .
ok , but we still don &apos;t know why he wounds them .
excuse me .
we know if the killer has no contact with his victims ,
he will contact the media .
but he hasn &apos;t contacted the media .
he has contact with his victims .
and there &apos;s only one way .
all right , thanks .
garcia nailed down the geographic profile .
the crime scenes are centered on 2 separate locations .
the hospitals .
i believe it &apos;s a case of hero homicide .
what &apos;s that ?
是医院护士理查德 · 安吉洛
he would inject toxins into his victims ,
then wait for them to crash
so that he could run to the rescue and save them .
he killed 25 people , and that &apos;s just what we know of .
if he attacked &apos; em to save &apos; em ,
why &apos;d he kill 25 people ?
wasn &apos;t very good at it .
弥留之际病人的档案
so what &apos;s the profile on one of these guys ?
arrogant , conceited , feels superior to everyone around them .
you &apos;ve just described every surgeon i &apos;ve ever met .
uh , forgive me . i don &apos;t shake .
my hands , you understand .
of course .
landman .
let &apos;s start with landman .
call weigart and tell him we need a discreet perimeter around this block .
i &apos;m gonna go check out landman &apos;s car .
ok . courtesy of garcia .
曾就读于宪兵学校
well , there &apos;s your law enforcement .
but he was smart ,
got a degree on uncle sam ,
and ended up a doctor with special forces
就辗转多家医院就职
has dr. landman been under any unusual strain ?
has he had a reprimand ?
has he had any kind of major blow to his ego ?
last month , he was passed over for chief of surgery .
看是否有那凶器
ok .
what can i do to help ?
you can tell me where he is right now .
where &apos;s marston ?
she &apos;s not coming .
look , i &apos;m very busy right now . perhaps you could make an appointment .
busy with what ?
things .
what kind of things ?
you &apos;re considering me a suspect ?
yes .
well , that &apos;s disconcerting .
i heard what happened to your last suspect .
do you wanna know why ?
collective incompetence ?
have you ever heard of hero homicide ?
would i be less suspicious if i let my patients die ?
absolutely .
you get anything from his car ?
it &apos;s a red 2 @-@ seat maserati .
heh . of course .
if he &apos;s the shooter , he has another vehicle .
this type of killer seeks the power over life and death
and covets the power of god .
you know anyone like that ?
i want you to understand something .
when my patients are in the operating room , they need god ,
and that &apos;s exactly what i give them .
when someone &apos;s holding your beating heart in their hands ,
who do you want holding it , me or god ?
where were you today at 3 : 00 ?
i was in my office .
alone ?
i was in my office with dr. hannah pate .
i &apos;m not the only one who thinks i &apos;m a god .
she &apos;s in the e.r. right now .
go on .
ask her .
great . let &apos;s take a walk down to the e.r.
会为兰德曼做不在场证明
you don &apos;t think landman &apos;s the shooter ?
richard angelo wanted to be a hero
他是个无名小卒
他有能力和认可度
yeah , but you know , surgeons are a different breed .
但兰德曼轮不上
excuse me .
i &apos;d like to speak with dr. pate .
yes , sir . i &apos;ll go find her for you .
寻求刺激 力量和博得尊敬
但他仍会受到尊敬
racing against the clock to save someone &apos;s life is exciting .
but maybe it &apos;s not exciting enough .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s why he shoots 3 people at a time .
but he can only operate on one at a time .
it wouldn &apos;t be any more exciting .
也不在急诊室
the policemen and e.r. personnel are on the exact same 24 @-@ hour shift schedule .
the unsub wasn &apos;t shooting at shift change
because there are fewer cops on the street .
he works the second shift in the emergency room .
contact with the victims .
sir , you can &apos;t use the cell phone in the hospital .
excuse me , please .
we &apos;re fbi agents ,
and we believe that one of your staff members might be the sniper .
the man we &apos;re looking for works second shift ,
and he would have transferred from arlington about 2 weeks ago .
we haven &apos;t hired any new personnel in 2 months .
are you sure ?
yeah .
he has the worst narcissistic personality disorder i &apos;ve ever seen ,
but he &apos;s not our guy .
look , i &apos;ve got patients who need me .
he &apos;s in his thirties .
工作上很卖力
he shows up to work late .
he blames others for his mistakes ,
doesn &apos;t take responsibility for his behavior .
all of his coworkers detest him .
it &apos;s phillip dowd .
he &apos;s @-@ he picks up shifts at arlington .
is he here today ?
oh , my god .
ok , your patients need you clam .
tell me , is dowd working today ?
do you see him ?
go tell gideon .
reid . easy .
nobody moves , and nobody dies .
better be a head shot .
i got this on full auto .
我就能接着开枪
get up !
get over here !
double time ! let &apos;s go !
you , take your partner &apos;s gun , put it on the counter .
he &apos;s not armed .
see for yourself .
hands on your heads .
get up , keith .
put those on &apos; em .
now put &apos; em on yourself .
now step back .
back up . back up . back up .
get down on the ground .
have a seat .
now , what kind of an fbi agent doesn &apos;t carry a gun ?
i &apos;m a profiler .
profiler ?
they sent you to figure me out .
we did . that &apos;s how we found you .
shut up . reid .
no , don &apos;t shut up .
tell me what you think you know about me .
go ahead , genius . tell him .
tell him .
but remember , get it wrong , and he &apos;s gonna kill you .
ok .
you &apos;re the boss . you tell me .
who am i ?
what &apos;s my plan ?
枪击11人却不留任何蛛丝马迹
却还能全身而退
and i know your plan is to go down in a hail of bullets .
what else do you know ?
he joined the army at 18 , went to ranger school ,
did 6 years before being dishonorably discharged in &apos; 95 for conduct unbecoming ,
obviously lied about it
joined the arlington p.d.
you were right . he was a cop .
for 9 months .
when they found out he lied about the discharge
they kicked him out .
soon thereafter , dowd got his nursing license .
he &apos;s been bouncing from hospital to hospital ever since .
都是最出类拔萃的
and no one &apos;s ever known it .
people feel threatened by you and
try to sabotage you every chance they get .
you &apos;re not a bad person .
you help save all of your victims afterwards .
first guy wasn &apos;t your fault .
if the emts had been there on time ,
he would &apos;ve lived .
13分钟啊
you want to barricade the door .
what ?
let me and the kid do it .
let &apos; em see that you &apos;ve got 2 fbi agents
in here doing your bidding .
right , let you give them a signal .
what signal ? they knew you were in here .
they knew you were armed . what can i tell them ?
what is this , some sort of profiler trick ?
new negotiation tactic ?
i think it &apos;s a good idea .
why would you wanna help me ?
i don &apos;t .
you said they knew i was in here .
i said they know you &apos;re in here .
no . that &apos;s not what you said .
why does it matter ?
it matters because your partner wants to help me
even though he doesn &apos;t know it .
go ahead , boss man .
tell him why .
一枪毙了你
they knew he was in here ,
they knew he was armed and dangerous ,
and they knew that he was gonna fight till the last round ,
and they sent me in here with an unarmed kid
who can &apos;t shoot his way out of a wet paper bag .
they set you up .
就在嘲笑我呢
that &apos;s why you wanna help me .
i wouldn &apos;t say i want to help you ,
but when they come in here to get revenge for the cop you killed ,
you &apos;re gonna go down fighting ,
and in the crossfire , a lot of us are gonna die .
they sent me in here . i figure why make it easy for them .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
please don &apos;t send your men in yet .
you have to consider the possibility that
your men are dead or at least disarmed .
agent hotch is a very experienced profiler .
让道尔德喜欢 相信并放他们一马
and once he does ...
he &apos;ll get dowd to end this peacefully .
i- i just ... ask that you give him time .
dowd &apos;s already shot 10 people .
he killed a cop .
the cop is dead .
this man is a violent , deranged paranoid .
it &apos;s a game .
什么都干得出来
you send in your men ,
they &apos;re just gonna become villains in his little hero fantasy .
you &apos;re lettin &apos; him call all the shots .
how are your unarmed men gonna stop him ?
they &apos;re not unarmed .
they have his profile .
they understand him .
那之后我们将拿下急诊室
your men ... have 3 minutes .
you know why they took away boy genius &apos;s gun ?
why ?
he failed his qualification .
我都得听他抱怨重考的事情
so i tutor him ...
and he fails again .
you think you got it rough ?
只会不断陷害我
put him next to the barricade .
that way , when they blast their way in here
both of our problems are solved .
that sort of thing can ruin a cop &apos;s career .
you are one sick dude .
how do you think i found you ?
time &apos;s up .
ready teams for assault .
can i ask you a favor ?
you can ask .
i figure the chances of my getting out of here alive are pretty slim .
so ?
i want to kick the snot out of this kid .
he &apos;s made my life miserable for 3 lousy years .
knock yourself out .
how smart are you now , smart guy ? !
it &apos;s front sight , trigger press , follow through !
that &apos;s enough !
it &apos;s not that hard !
a dalmatian could do it !
let go ! let go !
feel better ?
i think he got a messege .
what &apos;s that ?
we go in 5 ...
4
we go now !
federal agent .
federal agent . hold your fire !
hold your fire !
it &apos;s all clear .
shakespeare wrote ,
&quot; nothing is so common as the wish to be remarkable . &quot;
you all right ?
nice shot .
i was aiming for his leg .
i wouldn &apos;t have kept kicking ,
but i was afraid you didn &apos;t get my plans .
从我的火力线移开时 我就明白了
well , i hope i didn &apos;t hurt you too badly .
公立高中的12岁神童
you kick like a 9 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
no . keep it .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , you passed your qualification .
reid , you all right ?
touche , kid .
how you doin &apos; ?
you were right . you don &apos;t need a gun to kill somebody .
no , you don &apos;t .
but it helps .
yes .
yes .
应该感到不安
i mean ...
i killed a man .
you know , i @-@ i should ... feel something .
but i don &apos;t .
well , knowing what you &apos;re feelin &apos; ...
that &apos;s not the same as not feelin &apos; .
this is gonna hurt you ...
and when it does ...
there &apos;s only 3 facts you need to know .
you did what you had to do ...
and a lot of good people are alive because of what you did .
what &apos;s the third ?
i &apos;m proud of you .
