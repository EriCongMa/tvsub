what about lexi ?
she &apos;s in honduras .
but i don &apos;t do cheating .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t go with an anonymous sperm donor .
maybe we should ask timothy .
if you &apos;re interested in using me as , you know , a sperm donor , i &apos;m in .
i kept the money . i owe it to my dad .
i used it for something else .
you &apos;re concerned about my sobriety . i know i saw you .
it was a one time thing .
it was for me , too .
it won &apos;t ever happen again .
kids with adhd ,
it actually helps them to focus .
i don &apos;t wanna take this stuff . if i can get off of it ...
what about getting into a contact sport ?
someone got into the administrative office last night .
and a number of kindle paperwhites are now missing .
you didn &apos;t give my keys to anyone , did you ?
no .
you didn &apos;t come by school last night , did you ?
no , i was at the house having dinner .
why ?
daphne said she saw you .
when you were in the office last night , making the ids ,
did you steal some stuff , too ?
so what ?
whatever you took , put it back .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s brandon &apos;s car .
he was there last night .
morning .
how did you sleep ?
ok .
did you make a list of everyone who was there at your photo shoot ?
yeah .
are you going to tell principal sanchez about daphne ?
i think i have to , honey .
she &apos;s trying to get her daughter back .
well , we have to file a police report for the insurance .
she &apos;s almost eighteen . they could send her to prison .
there were other people there .
not people who had keys to the office .
i shouldn &apos;t have told you .
honey , if daphne didn &apos;t take anything
then she &apos;s got nothing to worry about .
i know it was really hard for you
but you did the right thing . ok ?
jesus , breakfast ! let &apos;s go !

oh , i missed you so much .
me , too .
you should &apos;ve seen your face , jesus , totally priceless .
no one tipped you off ?
no . i can honestly say i was blind @-@ sided by this one .
so , how long are you here ?
for a week . isn &apos;t that great ?
great !
but no closed doors in this house .
she &apos;s staying in mariana &apos;s room .
we promised lexi &apos;s parents ,
there will be no ... funny business .
i know what funny business is .
hey , you be careful , young man .
lexi , these pictures are really beautiful .
i had no idea honduras was so ...
tropical ? you live in , like , paradise .
i know , right ? i move over 2,000 miles away
and i &apos;m still going to school by the beach .
oh , speaking of school , we gotta roll you guys .
oh , yeah .
like now . let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re coming with us ?
i thought i &apos;d surprise some of my girls .
when i &apos;m not spending every free second i have with you , that is .
oh , lexi ! you forgot your phone , sweetheart .
i &apos;ll take it to her .
thanks , jesus .
hey you , plenty of time for photos later .
sorry , just wanted to see for myself .
well , maybe we &apos;ll just take a few of our own then .
say ... tonight ?
by the way , where &apos;s brandon ?
hot , hot . ow !
you know , i &apos;m sure dad has a spatula somewhere for that .
spatulas are for wusses .
i hope you like french toast .
i do , but i &apos;m actually running late .
so , thanks .
brandon .
yeah .
i don &apos;t want things to be weird between us .
yeah , no , i mean ...
we both made mistakes . we &apos;re gonna fix it , right ?
right .
which means you gotta get rid of that fake id
i &apos;m not going to tell your dad ,
but if you got caught using it you can get in a lot of trouble .
i &apos;m not going to use it again . i &apos;m getting rid of it .
good .
good morning , son .
goodbye , father .
good talkin &apos; to ya .
he &apos;s late .
what do we have here ?
breakfast .
i don &apos;t like you and brandon having cereal every morning .
and with you working nights ,
i thought i &apos;d at least get one good meal in him today .
i know . i &apos;ve been trying to get back to days , but no luck .
well , until you do ,
brandon &apos;s gonna keep coming home to an empty house ,
and , uh ... i worry .
what ? that he &apos;s not eating right ?
and other things .
other things ? like what ?
i don &apos;t know , like getting in trouble ?
brandon &apos;s never been in trouble .
i mean , other than this callie business ...
besides , it &apos;s temporary , him being here .
are you sure ? i mean , do you really think
he &apos;s gonna be able to live under the same roof as callie ?
i dunno . i mean , don &apos;t get me wrong ,
i &apos;d love to have him here long term ,
but he &apos;s so used to a full house .
what if i moved in ?
i mean it wouldn &apos;t be a full house ,
but at least it wouldn &apos;t be empty .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little soon ?
come on , mike , we &apos;re not kids .
we know when it &apos;s right .
and this is right . why wait ?
why not , ya know ... lean in ?
hey , i need to talk to you .
are you ok ?
did you ... break up with lexi ?
no . i tried , i did , but i couldn &apos;t because ...
she &apos;s here .
i had no idea she was coming back .
bye .
you &apos;re emma . we met online .
yeah , i crashed your &quot; jesus time . &quot;
my what ?
she &apos;s just joking .
lexi &apos;s staying with us for a whole week !
i totally surprised him . you should have seen his face .
i would have loved to .
well , since you &apos;re here , we &apos;ll see you at the meet later .
oh , to watch me ride the bench ? you don &apos;t need to do that .
i wanna be wherever you are today , silly .
yeah ... silly .
oh , my god !
you need to see the nurse .
i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re really not fine . i &apos;ll see you guys at lunch .
should i be worried ?
not at all . she &apos;s totally in the friend @-@ zone .
trust me , i &apos;ve been all over that .
if anything was going on , i &apos;d know .
zac . this is lexi .
best friend . meet my best new friend .
only new friend .
well , it &apos;s nice to finally meet you .
she talks about you all the time .
yeah , you too .
really ?
well , i &apos;m glad to know someone else on team mariana .
again , it &apos;s a team of one , so we could use a few more bodies .
ok , you can not be friends with that guy .
what ? why not ? you don &apos;t like him ?
i mean , he &apos;s adorable , but he &apos;s not your friend .
he &apos;s your crush .
oh , right . he was into me for awhile but ...
no , you &apos;re into him .
what ?
girl , you like , like him .
i have never thought about him that way .
ok , well , your mind better catch up with your body
because your body kinda wants to have his babies right now .
you have sex on the brain .
i didn &apos;t fly across the world to have another video chat . ok ?
did you do it ?
relax . the kindles are back , ok ?
and you &apos;ll have your 900 bucks this afternoon . so chill .
i can &apos;t believe you stole them in the first place .
what an idiot move .
you know what &apos;s an idiot move ?
making this a one time thing .
all i &apos;m sayin &apos; is after you pay back your dad ,
you could make some real bank for yourself .
money equals freedom , bro . think about it .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t need to . i &apos;m done .
i &apos;ve gotta take this .
thanks .
didn &apos;t know you could read .
i like the pictures . what can i do for you ?
i want in .
on what ?
you know what i &apos;m talking about .
really ?
just assumed a girl like you already had a fake .
fake id ?
hey , no judgment . it &apos;s just , you know , you are juvie girl .
well , i don &apos;t have one .
i &apos;ll need a photo .
ok .
stand over here , by the wall .
so , where do you make them ? the ids ?
afraid that &apos;s classified information .
here at school ?
say , happy @-@ hour !
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , nothing bad , honey . stef came by for lunch
and we thought this might be a good time to talk to you two alone .
uh , so , it &apos;s about the adoption .
but before we start i wanted to let you know
that the kindles were returned last night .
they were ?
yes . so we don &apos;t need to talk to principal sanchez about ... anything .
so , anyway , as you know
we &apos;ve started the adoption process ,
but before we can petition the court we ...
we have to ask permission from your father .
what does that mean ?
he has to sign away his parental rights .
why does he have any rights ?
he hasn &apos;t written us or tried to contact us in years .
well , legally , he &apos;s still your biological parent .
could he say no ?
he won &apos;t .
what if he does ?
then , we will petition the court to take away his rights ,
but hopefully that won &apos;t be necessary .
we just need to know from you guys
if it &apos;s all right if we ask him to let us be your parents .
it &apos;s fine .
do you have to ask him in person ?
no , no , the lawyer will do that .
in jail ?
he &apos;s not in jail ... prison anymore .
after i ran away , i tried to call him .
and they said he got out a year ago .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because , obviously , he doesn &apos;t care about us anymore and ...
and you were trying to protect me again ?
can i go eat lunch ?
sure .
jude .
honey .
you &apos;ve had time to process this . he just needs some , too .
that is why i want to go with an anonymous donor .
well , what if timothy would agree to be anonymous ?
there are contracts .
we don &apos;t even know if timothy is interested .
or do we ?
he , uh ... he mentioned it , after that dinner .
that &apos;s great .
tell you what , why don &apos;t you give me a ring when the baby is born
and i &apos;ll swing by the hospital and pick you up .
unless you already have a ride ?
honey .
i have to get to work .
stef !
what , you don &apos;t trust your business partner ?
we &apos;re not business partners .
we could be . we &apos;ve already got ten new clients lined up
ready to fork over twice what the first batch paid .
if you don &apos;t do it ,
i &apos;m going into business with my buddy at coronado springs .
just go for it . i &apos;m out .
ok , but , i don &apos;t trust him as much as i trust you .
not my problem .
it could be .
considering one of my new clients is her .
hey , man , i need your help .
hey , dude , have you seen callie ?
lexi &apos;s here .
i thought she was in honduras .
so did i. and i kissed emma , and i liked it .
and i was going to break up with lexi , but now i &apos;m not sure .
and lexi totally wants to have sex , like , tonight ...
yeah , that &apos;s fine . my dad &apos;s at work ,
i &apos;m not home &apos; til after six .
just don &apos;t do it on my bed .
a fake id ? really ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
don &apos;t lie to me .
that is rich coming from you .
what ?
i know you were at school the night of my photo shoot .
and now i know why you were here .
making fake ids in the office .
look ... i didn &apos;t want to get you involved .
did you steal the e @-@ readers , too ?
vico did . i didn &apos;t know anything .
i accused daphne of taking them !
i made him bring &apos; em back .
too late . i told stef and lena ,
and now they think she did it .
i &apos;m sorry .
i lost a friend because of you .
what am i supposed to do ?
why are you selling fake ids ?
i needed the money .
what for ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , i am .
i don &apos;t even know who you are anymore .
hey , did you get my text ?
yup , emojis and all .
i had no idea you had such school spirit .
yeah , well , it &apos;s my brother &apos;s first time competing .
um , i kinda got a little carried away .
but , can you come ? lexi and i are gonna make giant cards
that spell out his name , and we need you to hold one .
i &apos;m supposed to go straight home after school .
please , he needs all the support he can get .
emma broke her finger , and now he &apos;s gotta wrestle .
and , um ... after i was thinking maybe we could all go out .
you , me , lexi , jesus . just four people .
hangin &apos; out .
in a totally non @-@ weird way .
yeah , so i just got this in today .
it looks totally legit , right ?
i need to talk to you .
vico sent me .
yeah , it sucks , but i guess
one of the fakes got confiscated last night at a bar .
bouncer called the kid &apos;s parents and everything ,
so we &apos;re gonna need to get &apos; em back .
seriously ?
yeah , they &apos;re totally a bust .
but , uh , don &apos;t worry i &apos;ll get you your money back .
here you go .
no , spread the word , ok ?
we don &apos;t want anyone else getting caught , right ?
all right , let &apos;s count it out ...
one , two , three , four ,
five , six , seven , eight ...
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not wrestling that guy .
whew , thank god .
you ... are wrestling him .
the human pretzel ?
he &apos;s slippery , but you can take him .
i &apos;m sorry about ...
yeah , whatcha gonna do ?
but hey , big day , your first time competing .
how do you feel ?
nauseous .
listen , about lexi ...
lexi who ?
out here , i &apos;m not a girl . remember ?
i was gonna break up with her , but ...
but what ?
she came all the way from honduras .
maybe that &apos;s a good thing .
i mean , if it were me ,
i &apos;d rather be broken up with in person .
who are you texting ?
我们能谈谈吗
oh . um ... daphne .
telling her that the kindles were returned .
she didn &apos;t take them .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little suspicious , honey ?
that you confronted her and the very next day they reappeared ?
our concern is that you &apos;re in a vulnerable position .
we all are .
the court was hesitant to let you come home so soon .
and we ... we &apos;re all on probation .
principal sanchez has to
fill out your progress reports at school ,
and we can &apos;t control the way she perceives certain things .
like the company you keep .
what are you saying ?
i can &apos;t be friends with daphne and kiara ?
no , of course you can , just at a distance for now .
at least until your adoption goes through
and we &apos;re your legal parents .
so i have to make nice with the privileged kids
because they &apos;re the right kind of company .
even though they &apos;re probably the ones who stole the stuff .
we understand this is confusing , callie ...
no , i &apos;m not confused . this is exactly how the system works .
can i go sit with mariana ?
callie ...
sure , honey .
she &apos;s not wrong .
no . but neither are we .
oh , my god , i can &apos;t wait to see his butt in that little leotard .
okay a , it &apos;s called a singlet .
and b , may have just thrown up a little bit in my mouth .
nervous ?
a little bit .
good . harness that energy , and focus .
focus is key . got it ?
i got it .
all right .

no , it &apos;s been good for him .
he was just so jumpy this morning .
was he ?
yeah , i mean ...
he would come to us , right ?
if he wanted to get back on his medication .
there &apos;s no shame in that .
not for us . but ... for him ?
he has a ... certain charisma .
击败鲸鱼队
he &apos;s really popular with the students .
he &apos;s certainly attractive .
he &apos;s a rhodes scholar .
scholar , i remember that .
and he &apos;s an animal lover , too .
he also published a novel when he was 29,
and he plays the sitar .
what is that ?
like an indian guitar , or something .
honestly , i have no idea what it is .
but it &apos;s really cool , don &apos;t you think ?
and he &apos;s kind ?
very .

what &apos;s wrong ? are you ok ?
yeah .
so , i wanted you to know ,
i bought back all the ids .
well , as many as i could . and i destroyed them .
well , i &apos;m glad to hear that .
i stopped going to piano for a few weeks ,
but i kept my dad &apos;s money . and i need to pay it back .
why did you do that ?
for you .
for your apartment .
when you were going into independent living .
i ... wanted to make sure you had everything you needed .
you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
i would &apos;ve done anything to help you .
and i still will .
because you do know who i am .
how exciting was that !
that was amazing !
it was .
oh , my gosh .
you were really great out there , foster .
thanks , that means a lot .
listen , um ...
i know .
you &apos;re not gonna break up with lexi .
i may be benched ... but i &apos;m not blind .
i really like you .
but i love lexi .
and i told her i &apos;d wait .
i get it .
come on , baby .
so happy for you .
gods .
let &apos;s go get the car , you guys . come on , come on .
i &apos;ve , um ... i &apos;ve got somewhere we can be alone .
ok , see ya .
hey , wait . why the rush ?
sorry , i just ... i gotta get home .
oh , ok . i just , i thought , you know ...
maybe we could all ... you know ?
is this ... are we , like , on a date ?
well , no , i mean ...
unless you want it to be a date .
what &apos;re you doing ?
just ... looking through my pockets , for panties .
oh , very funny . you know , forget it .
ok , so ...
do you wanna go on a real date ?
one we both know we &apos;re on ?
zachary !
get in the car , right now .
i ... i gotta go .
who is that ?
my mom . sorry .
now !
you &apos;re telling people our ids don &apos;t work ?
i changed my mind .
well , i didn &apos;t change mine !
it &apos;s a felony , vico . i did us both a favor .
oh , yeah ? well , now i &apos;m gonna return the favor .
what does that mean ?
nobody screws me over .
uh , wait , wait . i think we need to talk .
about what ?
i kissed someone . back in honduras .
you ... who ?
this ... boy .
i don &apos;t even know if it ...
it &apos;ll turn into anything , but i wanted you to know .
so what does this mean ?
maybe it &apos;s just too hard .
you know ? to wait .
but i love you .
i love you , too .
but i really think we need to break up .
lexi , come on , you don &apos;t have to do this .
what , i &apos;m gonna stay here ?
i just broke up with your brother , mariana .
ok , fine , but you don &apos;t have to go all the way to honduras .
i mean , we were supposed to have a whole week to ...
i can &apos;t ... i &apos;m sorry .
i just need to go home .
can i just ask ...
is there really a boy in honduras ?
there will be .
oh , hey ! sorry to just barge in like this .
your dad gave me a key so i could get dinner started .
lasagna ! your favorite , right ?
that &apos;s really nice , um , i
i kinda need to talk to my dad when he gets home .
alone .
ok ... sounds serious .
anything you wanna tell me ?
i think you know you can trust me with a secret .
maybe i can help .
i owe my dad 900 dollars .
he hasn &apos;t mentioned that .
because he doesn &apos;t know .
hey . why didn &apos;t you just ring the doorbell ?
i just ... i can &apos;t stay long .
oh , well , based on your lack of emojis ,
i &apos;m assuming it &apos;s something serious .
yeah ...
i , um ...
i just ... i think that we should just be friends .
why ?
i just , i have a lot of commitments right now and ...
i just don &apos;t think ...
is this because of your mom , or something ?
was she mad ?
no !
no , it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with her . it &apos;s me .
i just ... i don &apos;t have time for a girlfriend right now .
so i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
how come it says &quot; t.j. ? &quot;
dad &apos;s name is donald .
those are grandpa &apos;s initials : thomas jacob .
did i ever meet him ?
when you were really little . he died pretty young though .
i should have told you that dad &apos;s out of prison .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just thought , the more you know , the more it hurts .
yeah , well , not knowing sucks .
we &apos;re better off without him .
i know .
hey there .
everything ok ?
yeah . we &apos;re ok .
good .
so , listen ,
the adoption lawyer has found your father .
where ?
not far from here , actually . north park .
now the lawyer spoke to your father ,
and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights .
that &apos;s good .
but the lawyer would like to know
if you two would like to see your father first .
oh , we don &apos;t .
i do .
jude ...
you don &apos;t have to . but i wanna see my dad .
you &apos;re probably gonna ground me , or whatever .
but i just wanted to tell you the truth .
i &apos;m glad you told me .
so , what did you do with the money ,
since you didn &apos;t give it to callie ?
thanks .
i &apos;m sorry , dad .
i can &apos;t believe he did this . it &apos;s so not like him .
frankly , i &apos;m surprised he hasn &apos;t acted out before now .
what &apos;s that supposed mean ?
imagine how he must have felt when stef and lena moved in the twins .
he went from being an only child to having two instant siblings .
and now they &apos;ve done it again with callie and jude .
it &apos;s just another reason why he needs to be here with us ,
before he makes another bad decision .
should we be worried ?
about ... jude seeing his father ?
he just needs closure . i think it &apos;s a good thing .
i think callie could use some , too .
you think she &apos;ll change her mind about seeing him ?
she &apos;s pretty angry .
am i crazy ?
is this a trick question ?
to want to have a baby when we &apos;ve got all these kids ?
all these kids ...
... are gonna be off to college ,
hopefully , in a few years .
the house is gonna seem awfully empty , i think .
if you want to use timothy ,
i think we should ...
... get together , all three of us , and talk about it .
really ?
yeah , really .
what time do we have to pick callie up from group ?
about an hour . we &apos;ve got time .
time for what ... mrs. adams foster ?
you look just like your mother .
