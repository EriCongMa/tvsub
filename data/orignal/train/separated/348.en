Come on!
I can't believe you did that.
I got us free shots, didn't I?
Michelle, everyone was taking pictures.
They better tag us, then.
That's the last thing I want. What if Adam saw?
He's at a bachelor party in Vegas.
If they only wake up with a tiger in their bathroom,
they've failed at life.
What happened? I thought the girls were right behind us.
I think Amber Lee had to close out.
You want me to go get them?
Yeah, right. I'll never see you again.
You wait here. I'll go get them.
Fine. Have another drink while you're at it.
Next stop is the Pole Vault,
and they have a strict "no prudes" policy.
And get us some wine.
Hey there, cowboy.
You got a light?
Slow down, stetson.
My friends are probably looking for me.
I can't help it. You're so beautiful.
Houston, I think we have a problem.
Must've had too much to drink.
Of course you did.
Get off of me.
Hey. Come on, just give me a damn second.
Uh...no.
No. It's not working.
We're through.
I'll say when we're through.
The theory of variation.
Time to prove who did the reading.
Susan.
It focuses on the universal
properties common to a given language.
You're quoting the text. Give me an example.
French.
Uh, spoken worldwide, but the same phrase in Paris
might have a completely different inference in Montreal.
That's right. This theory looks at the cultural stages
a particular language undergoes
in order to understand its evolution.
Who can tell me the first stage?
Anton.
Pidgin.
Pidgin is correct, Mr. Slavsky.
This is when non-native speakers use phrases
from the mainstream language in a broken manner,
often resulting in an overly literal...
translation of the meaning.
I thought cell phones weren't allowed in class, Dr. Blake.
It would appear that I'm a variation
to my own rule.
Jeffrey.
Last night Michelle Bradley
went missing from a friend's bachelorette party
in Austin, Texas.
Austin P.D. say that she is the third
in a series of abductions in a week.
Right. The first victim, Craig Pickett,
he was a student at T.U.
He disappeared from a fraternity party.
He was discovered at the visitor parking lot just after sunrise.
He had been beaten with a blunt object.
And then Heather Wilson, she was a veterinarian
living in the old west district.
She disappeared from a speed-dating function thing
and she was found in a nearby alley the next morning.
She had been stripped and she had been stabbed.
Each of the victims was at a
social gathering the night that they were abducted.
Witness reports say that
they were there one minute and gone the next.
Ok, so this guy doesn't waste any time.
He knows who he wants and how to get them.
That shows organization and sophistication.
He had Craig and Heather
for less than 12 hours before he killed them.
We may already be out of time to save Michelle.
No apparent link in victimology.
What troubles me is the variation in M.O.
The speed and efficiency of the abduction suggests one unsub.
So is he using weapons of opportunity
or specifically catering his murder ritual to each victim?
There's clear evidence of overkill on both.
Craig's face was caved in,
and the damage to Heather's genitals was extensive.
He's angry, but about what?
Well, the motive on Heather appears sexual.
She was stripped down to nothing more than a watch,
while Craig was left fully clothed.
His wallet was missing.
There might be some kind of financial motivation.
Or it's plain old-fashioned jealousy.
He kills Craig in a rage and the beast is unleashed.
That's when he starts targeting women.
His area of control appears to be quite large.
What's interesting is he dumps the bodies
in the same district they're abducted from.
So he doesn't go far, yet he'd need privacy.
Maybe he uses his vehicle for the assaults.
Which means he could be anywhere.
"The world breaks everyone,
and afterward, many are stronger at the broken places."
Ernest Hemingway.
Gentlemen.
Detective Sanchez.
Agent Morgan.
Agent Rossi.
Appreciate the help.
I haven't seen anything like this before.
Consider yourself fortunate.
She was stabbed?
It's a lot of blood.
It looks like Michelle was still bleeding out
when the unsub dumped her here.
He was probably with her the whole night.
A large pickup truck or an SUV would go unnoticed
in these parts.
Give him room to work.
A bachelorette party and a speed-dating function.
Both female victims were in situations
that would have drawn the attention of the men around them.
So maybe the unsub was on the prowl.
The women could have enraged him
by rejecting his advances.
Well, they didn't reject him right away, though.
He was able to lure both into isolation,
which tells me he's got game.
Well, what about Craig Pickett?
He disappeared from a frat party.
Well, Pickett was the first victim.
And the unsub's use of a blunt object rather than a knife
suggests that the kill was impulsive.
It's probable that Craig and the unsub are connected.
You should take a closer look
at his classmates and professors.
Excuse me for a minute.
What's up?
Michelle Bradley's crime scene photos just came in.
Take a look.
He took off everything but the watch,
just like with Heather Wilson.
No clothes, no earrings,
not so much as a hair tie left.
But he leaves a watch.
It's a compulsion.
It could be his signature.
Shanice, do you happen to remember
if Michelle was wearing this watch last night?
I don't think so.
I don't know.
Do you happen to have any pictures on your phone
I could take a look at?
Oh...yeah, we took a couple.
Here you go.
Thank you.
I counted 40 stab wounds of various depths of penetration.
He's targeting her femininity.
This type of anger stems from a deep-seated hatred of women.
Or a woman.
So you think they're surrogates
for someone who emasculated him?
The time and effort it takes to stab someone 40 times
takes determination,
the sort indicative of someone affected by a past trauma.
Well, if his work here is any indication,
he's unraveling quickly.
We should take a look at Craig.
He triggered the unsub's violence.
He certainly put up the biggest fight. Here.
Let me show you.
Craig was harder to control.
How did he get the bruising on his chest and back?
He was fully clothed when he was found.
There's no tears in his shirt.
He must not have been wearing it when he was attacked.
The unsub dressed him postmortem.
He's showing remorse.
Craig was closer to his attacker than we thought.
How long have you and Craig been roommates?
Since freshman year.
You two seem very close.
He was like my brother.
Well, that's rare.
My freshman roommate and I didn't get along. At all.
You told police you went to the game
the night after Craig disappeared?
What happened after that?
Uh, came back to the campus.
Hit a couple of frat parties.
Which ones?
Uh--uh--I don't really remember.
I was drunk.
This must be tough,
having to pack up all his things on your own.
Didn't his family want to help?
Well, we've been living together a long time.
I told them I'd sort through what was his and what was mine.
Yeah. That reminds me
of another roommate I had at the academy.
She used to make me promise her
that if something ever happened to her,
I'd get rid of anything her parents shouldn't see.
What didn't Craig want his parents to see, Will?
Was it this?
You may want to put that with the other things.
Please, you can't tell them.
I've scoured the victims' social feeds, and I can confirm
Michelle is the only one
who turned up wearing a watch that didn't belong to her.
Well, she's also the only one not wearing a watch when abducted.
Time is somehow important to this unsub.
But not the right time. None of the watches were accurate.
That has to mean something.
Well, it's a message, but for whom?
The watch he put on Michelle was broken.
Could that be his way of saying her time was up?
Maybe they were taunts, telling us that we're out of time.
Could it be like time of death?
You know, like only the unsub understands it
notification kind of thing?
You know, Garcia might be right.
It happens.
Not about the notifications. The times don't add up.
But what if it's a warning? What if he's setting the watches
to the time of the next abduction?
6:22.
I really hope you're wrong, Spence.
Listen, I will take a shot if you'll ride the bull.
I'll ride the bull. I'll ride the bull. Let's go.
3, 2, 1.
Oh, come on. That was disgusting.
What is that?
Oh, come on, don't tell me
you've reached the shot stage already?
You're late. Where you been?
And you brought a stray. Who's your friend, Mitch?
This is Doug. He just transferred in from the Boston office,
and he is in desperate need of friends and beverages.
And not necessarily in that order.
Ah, you came to the right place. Sit down.
Have a drink.
Yeah, you come sit by me, Doug.
After you.
You're stuck with me, I guess.
You're stuck with me, pal.
How's it going? I'm Paige.
Doug. Nice to meet you.
I'm Paul. Hi.
You mind?
Not if you share. Then we're cool.
Thank you.
How was work?
I need a drink.
Oh. Here. Have at it.
Thank you so much.
So...what kind of trouble are we getting into tonight?
Oh, you like trouble.
Who doesn't?
Michelle was a smoker.
If the unsub saw her on his own,
he could have asked to bum a cigarette or offered her a light.
It's an easy in.
Yeah. But according to the M.E.'s report,
neither Heather nor Craig were smokers.
They don't need to be. This guy's socially proficient.
He can adapt his ruse to whomever he targets.
Well, does that include sexual orientation?
Craig Pickett was at a gay bar
the night he went missing.
Well, that fits with the other abductions.
But why would the roommate lie?
Craig hadn't come out to his parents.
Will was trying to protect his friend's secret.
Or intentionally obstructing the investigation.
No, I don't think so.
Because of the physical brutality he suffered,
Will assumed Craig was the victim of a hate crime
and didn't want his death becoming a media spectacle.
So we're back to square one.
Not necessarily.
Craig was the only victim that the unsub felt remorse for.
Their connection could have been an intimate one.
You know, I gotta say...
that was one hell of a welcome to Austin.
I guess we got a little carried away.
Need some help?
Got it.
Ok.
You all right?
Paul?
What's wrong?
We shouldn't have done that.
I thought you were into it.
I wasn't.
I was. Just I...
You should go.
No, not until you talk to me.
Here. Have a seat.
What is going through your head right now?
Guys are not sup--
Guys are supposed to be with girls.
Oh, man.
Someone really did a number on you, didn't they?
Parent or pastor?
How do you do this? I mean, how are you ok with this?
I wasn't. Not for a real long time.
But there comes a point when you just gotta ask yourself
how much longer are you willing to pretend
to be someone that you aren't.
Who says I'm pretending? Who says I'm...
Hey. This room, for one.
Yeah, it is a mess.
Yeah, it's...
I don't know what I'm doing.
Then I guess it's a good thing you met me, then.
I'm a great teacher.
Relax, baby.
I'm a great teacher.
Get out. Just-- don't touch me.
Paul, what the hell?
Don't...
There's been another victim?
Doug Warn.
An accountant from Boston.
Hotch and Rossi are still at the crime scene.
Body was dumped near a park.
Was he wearing a watch?
6:59. Was the watch still working?
If you mean by working, still ticking, yeah,
but it was at least 2.1/2 hours off, though.
Now that we have a few working watches, though,
we might be able to see a pattern
in how or why the unsub changes the times.
Let's see.
6...
What time was the body discovered?
I don't know. An hour ago, maybe. Why?
You know the exact time?
A jogger called it in...
at 9:04. He was running laps,
so the body couldn't have been laying there more than a few minutes.
I...
think I know what the messages say.
Well, Reid, spit it out already.
6:22.
Ok, are you talking about Michelle's watch or Doug's watch?
I'm talking about all the watches.
If you take the times the bodies were discovered,
subtract the variance the corresponding watches are off by,
you land within plus or minus 6 minutes of 6:22
every single time. Which, taking into consideration
the time between dump and discovery and all the public areas
and the fact that the only broken watch we found
was already stuck at 6:22,
it's reasonable to deduce
the unsub sets the watches to the exact same time
just before disposing of the bodies.
So stupid.
It was literally staring me in the face the whole time.
I don't know how I missed it.
Come on, Reid, stop.
You're the only person who can realize all of this.
So what does 6:22 mean?
I have no idea.
Reid...
All I know is what it says. I don't know what it means.
Well, he used a blunt object again.
This kill was just as impulsive as the first.
Were there any defensive wounds under his clothes?
No, but you should take a look.
That's combining murder rituals.
Is he unraveling or evolving his M.O.?
It could be both.
Did he inflict the stab wounds pre- or postmortem?
It was all postmortem after the first blow.
Back of his head. Killed him instantly.
Next was the face?
Actually, no. Based on the blood loss,
I'd say the stabbing was first.
That doesn't add up. Why would he switch to a knife,
then go back to the blunt object after?
Well, he must be attacking the face for a specific reason.
It could be a manifestation of his guilt,
like the re-dressing.
Or of his self-worth.
Maybe he didn't want the men to see him.
His self-esteem would have been at an all-time low.
But he only reached the low with the men,
not the women.
Dr. Aylesworth, did the victim have sex before he died?
I believe so. I found traces of lubricant
consistent with that used on latex condoms.
Thank you.
We believe we're looking for a white homosexual male
in his mid- to late 20s
who is suffering from an identity crisis.
This man can't accept his same-sex desires,
but he can't fight them either.
He's most likely been repressing all sexual urges for quite some time.
The first victim, Craig Pickett,
represents a fall from the wagon, if you will.
Intercourse between the two men
was most likely the unsub's trigger.
Immediately after copulation,
the male's serotonin levels drop.
The high is achieved during sex.
That rapid change can manifest itself in extreme depression
and low self-esteem.
Combined with an apparent belief
that acting on his attraction towards other men is wrong,
this state causes the unsub to lash out violently at those he's with.
As his levels normalize,
he begins to feel remorse for what he's done
and he tries to correct his course.
This is where Heather and Michelle come in.
After killing Craig, the unsub sought out women
that he was desperate to be attracted to.
But he's trapped in a scenario with an impossible outcome.
He can't force himself to like women,
so when he's unable to get aroused,
he becomes depressed again and lashes out in anger
to the people he blames for his impotence.
The circular logic dictating his never-ending cycle
was not formed overnight.
It most likely came about due to years of serious abuse,
either emotional, physical, or both.
We're more than friends.
What are you talking about?
I like him. Like like him.
The hell you do. Don't even think like that, son.
It's how I feel.
No, it isn't.
It can't be.
He's taken advantage of you somehow.
He hasn't. It's the truth.
Truth?
The truth?
I'll show you the truth.
The most popular motive
for trying to overcome same-sex attraction
is the need to be accepted by the parent or loved one
who has rejected the individual because of their homosexuality.
So focus on men who grew up in a broken home
and suffered under the guardianship of a domineering parent,
as well as those who fell victim to bigotry or bullying.
Tell her she's beautiful.
I am, aren't I?
You're an abomination!
I'm a great teacher.
You're doing it wrong.
I'm gonna make you a real man.
An abomination!
The bottom line is this unsub will not stop killing.
With each failed attempt to become aroused by women
or to avoid giving in to his same-sex urges,
he becomes more desperate and more dangerous.
Thank you.
Oh, thank god you're ok.
You haven't been answering your phone all day
and I thought something had happened to you, too.
What are you talking about?
Doug was murdered last night.
What?
Yeah, it must have happened after you dropped him off.
He didn't show up to work and so I--
I went by his apartment and there were cops everywhere.
What'd you tell them?
Nothing. I came straight here to make sure you were OK.
I'm fine.
Fine, I promise.
Getting the 4-1-1 on a 6-2-2 is not easy.
I am looking up that date,
and June 22 is quite eventful in recent history.
It sounds like Miss Thing's got something good.
Well, uh, let's see.
On this date in 1990,
Florida banned the wearing of thong bikinis.
I said good, baby girl.
Right, right. Ok.
Let's see. June 22, 1992,
Supreme Court ruled Minnesota hate-crime laws
violated free speech.
The defendant burned a cross
on the front yard of an African-American family's house
who lived next door.
Nothing in the unsub's profile suggests racial motivation, though.
No, but the cross has me thinking.
Many religions suggest
that following through on homosexual desires
invites condemnation.
What if the unsub is struggling with his faith?
Garcia,
are there any 6:22 Bible passages
that are relevant?
Yeah, I thought of that,
but the most popular one is Matthew 6:22
and it has to do with lights and eyes. I don't see how that fits.
All right, well, let's look at this another way.
What are the passages that specifically relate to homosexuality?
That's it. He's not saying 6:22.
He's saying 18:22.
As in Leviticus 18:22.
"Thou shalt not lie with mankind
as with womankind,
for it is an abomination."
He converted 18:22 to 6:22 p.m..
Like military time.
Maybe the unsub suffered abuse at the hands of someone
citing God's will that he should change.
It wouldn't be the first time someone took the Good Book
and twisted it for their own agenda.
Ok, but if you wanted to change someone's sexual orientation,
how could you do it? I mean,
you're not gonna guilt somebody into that.
Uh, I'm seeing some stuff about an ex-gay movement.
It looks like some kind of a 12-step program.
A 12-step program
usually doesn't traumatize the participant.
But conversion therapy might.
Several conversion camps have been shut down recently
'cause their methods border on torture.
Yeah, but why would any faith condone the torture of children?
None of them would. Even a religion that frowns on homosexuality.
None of them would cross that line.
Garcia, are there conversion camps in the area?
I got a hit. Camp Willing
operates just outside of Austin.
Their motto is, "It's time to change."
And guess which biblical passage is on their home page.
Mitch.
What are you doing in here?
I had to use the bathroom.
Is this Doug's blood?
It's not my fault.
Not your fault. Whose fault was it, Paul?
Theirs.
Theirs?
Yeah.
How could it be their fault?
They haven't laid a hand on you in years.
You know what they did to me?
Of course I do. They did the same thing to me, too.
There we go. No forgetting what time it is now.
Best hurry off. You don't want to be late for class, do you?
I can't let you leave yet, Mitch.
We have to work some things out first.
Our main purpose is to promote positive changes
for the conflicted individuals who come here.
There doesn't seem to be much room for self-expression.
We try to keep things as uniform as possible.
We're not trying to stifle them.
It's just that progressive behavior in many ways
can unravel their recovery efforts.
Such as colors?
Earth tones like brown or tan are the go-to.
Navy blue if the color doesn't fade or become too bright.
Because bright blue would be considered too feminine?
Exactly.
And the auto shop aids in conversion how?
We've found that immersing the boys
in traditional male gender roles
stimulates an appreciation of their own masculinity.
I know it seems extreme,
but you have to remember,
our participants are in a fragile state of mind.
They come here confused, looking for answers.
We show them that the path to redemption
doesn't need to be walked alone.
You sound like you speak from experience.
I'm a graduate.
The camp taught me to reject societal influences
that were steering me in the wrong direction.
And now I try to pass that knowledge on.
Come.
When a new participant arrives,
we have to evaluate their personal property
before it can be returned to them.
Items like musical soundtracks or diaries are destroyed.
Long hair is cut, dyed hair shaved, no earrings.
That sort of thing.
The watch is standard issue?
Cell phones aren't permitted.
The watches are so that
no one will be late to any of their lessons.
Structure and timeliness become an important part of promoting change.
And what if someone breaks the rules?
It's uncommon.
Uncommon but not unheard of.
Oh, occasionally a student will act out
or reject certain elements of the program.
What happens to those who act out?
Advanced therapy under supervision of a senior counselor.
Could you be more specific?
I'm afraid I can't.
Parents and staff sign confidentiality agreements
to protect the parents' right to privacy.
And what about the children's rights?
Was there anything else I can help you with, agents?
Yes. We'd like a list of program participants
dating back the past 15 years.
All we want are names.
That's quite impossible.
Those records are confidential.
Well, let's make them unconfidential.
Or we'll be back here with a court order.
Whoa, that's a lot of names.
Cross the list with know associates
of each victim and see if you get a hit.
And, Garcia, flag the participants who didn't finish the program.
They're most likely the ones
who had to endure this so-called advanced therapy.
With X's and O's I go.
Thank you.
You should have seen it.
All sense of individuality was stripped away.
And these kids were young.
You're sure it was the same watch?
The unsub went to that camp.
The watch he put on Michelle's wrist
was the exact same model that all the kids were wearing.
What do you think was behind that padlocked door?
Well, it could be anything.
I mean, come on, we've all read the stories.
A conversion camp was just shut down last year
for using electric shock therapy on children.
Another stripped the kids naked
and screamed profanities at them.
We need to go back with a warrant.
We're gonna need probable cause.
Well, let's find some.
Because there is more going on at that camp than they let on.
You gotta turn yourself in, Paul.
I can't turn myself in. They're gonna put me away.
What, are you gonna kill me, too?
No.
Are you gonna turn me in?
No.
No, Paul.
Y-you just need some help.
I've already had help. You remember that?
No, I mean like real help, professional help.
It worked for me.
Did it?
Yeah. Me and Josh are coming up on like 6 months now.
Yeah.
It might throw a wrench in your happy union...
You hanging out with a serial murderer and all.
Oh, my god.
Those women.
The ones who were stabbed.
That was you, wasn't it, Paul?
They reminded me of her.
What you got, mama?
A man named Mitchell Ruiz
went to Camp Willing in 2003.
He works at the same office as our dearly departed Doug Warn.
What's the catch?
Well, Mitchell's office just reported him missing.
He went to go look for Doug, he never returned.
So Mitchell either is our unsub or he fell victim to him.
I did a little research to see
if he was one of th good kids or the bad kids.
It turns out that Mitchell's parents,
3 weeks into that conversion camp,
they started making private payments to a dummy corp
that was shut down two years ago for prosecution,
as in one prostitute, Isabella Grant.
and from the amount of money they were paying her,
you have to wonder
what morals she wasn't willing to chew up and swallow.
Miss Grant, my name's Aaron Hotchner.
I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to talk to you about Camp Willing.
What are you offering?
You don't seem surprised.
It was a matter of time.
And you've already got me in here
for everything else.
So what are you gonna give me if I talk?
I don't make deals with child molesters.
I didn't molest anyone.
I was hired to help those kids.
Being paid to prey on your victims doesn't change anything.
I had parental consent.
Is that what the camp told you
to make you feel better?
They didn't have to.
Why? Because you didn't care?
Or because you'd spoken to the parents directly?
You show absolutely no remorse for what you've done.
Why should you?
The smaller the victim, the easier to control.
And that's what it's all about for you, isn't it? Control.
It's why you're showing me all this false confidence.
I'm done talking.
You've said plenty.
A professional like yourself
wouldn't trust the camp to protect you.
You had to get some sort of
insurance directly from the parents, didn't you?
Make sure that they were just as culpable for the crime.
Your word against theirs wouldn't hold up in court,
not with a child testifying to your abuse.
Unless, of course, the abuse damned the parents as well.
They were in the room with you, weren't they?
You made them watch.
Where are you going? What about my deal?
We never had a deal.
Why didn't it work?
Why didn't what work?
With the girls. Why couldn't I just--
Why couldn't I just do it?
You killed them. What more did you want to do?
Not that.
It.
I could always get it up for her.
Well, then we were teenagers.
We could practically get it up for tomato soup.
You ever wonder why we broke up?
You ever wonder that?
I'm pretty sure that year of hell had something to do with it.
Yeah, a year.
You were lucky.
I screwed up, Mitch. I--
I thought that maybe those girls could fix me.
Paul, listen to me.
You don't need fixing.
You just need a little bit of help.
Now, please, man, just give me the gun.
You know that this isn't the way.
Relax. You got it.
You're so beautiful.
Damn it, Paul.
That's not the way.
Come here.
Let me show you.
You know what? You're right?
I'm not the one that needs fixing.
Garcia, I need you to track who was at the conversion camp
the same time as Mitchell Ruiz,
and then narrow that to those whose parents made payments
to Isabella Grant's dummy corporation.
Uh...Only one name matches. Paul Westin.
He went to the same school as Mitchell,
and his mom was killed in action in Iraq
when he was only a 'tween.
All right, find out everything you can about Paul
and then send the address to JJ and Blake.
Yep. Sending it now.
Clear.
Clear.
Clear. JJ?
Paul?
Get in the house right now.
What's going on? Are you in trouble, son?
Don't you call me that!
You don't get to call me that!
Not after what you did to me.
Paul, please.
What did I do?
What did you do? The camp? You remember, huh?
You remember that?
Get your ass downstairs!
Let's talk about this, son.
There's nothing to talk about!
Paul!
What the hell? You gonna kill your dad?
I was trying to save you.
Save me? Ha.
You mean fix me, don't you?
Fix me. All those years trying to prove to me that I was broken.
Well, it worked, dad.
It worked. I'm pretty damn broken now.
That's not what I wanted.
What you wanted.
Take his clothes off.
What?
Take his clothes off.
What for?
Well, they all thought that they could rape us straight.
I think it's time we see if it works the other way around.
We have to assume Mitchell is with him.
The keys and wallet are in the living room.
Could he be working with Paul?
Everything points to Paul working alone,
but that doesn't mean that Mitchell isn't sympathetic to the cause.
He experienced the same trauma.
I think I know why.
They were in a relationship.
They were abused for loving one another.
Where would they go?
With Mitchell helping him, they'd be focused on revenge.
Isabella's in prison, so he wouldn't have a lot of options.
You two head to the camp and
I'll send the others to the father's house.
Get to it already.
I can't.
I want to go home, Paul, please.
He's the one that got us into that camp.
Convinced your parents to let that woman do this to us.
Do you want to make him pay?
Of course I do, but not like this.
Mitchell, I'd do it if I could.
But I can't. It's gotta be you.
And then what? It's not gonna solve anything.
I'm not looking for solutions.
I'm just looking to cope. Right, dad?
This isn't coping.
This is crazy.
You're starting to sound like one of them.
Only one of us is suggesting rape.
It's Paul's truck.
Paul?
Mitch? Mitch.
Son!
Hey, you're ok. Come here.
Come here. Now you're all right.
Mitch.
Don't you--don't you die on me.
Don't do it!
Don't do it, Paul.
There's nothing left for me here.
Look at his wrist. Track marks.
What happened to you in that camp, Paul?
It doesn't matter anymore.
Yes, it does.
You kill yourself, they get away with it.
If you testify, we can shut them down for good.
What good? I'm an abomination.
No, you're not.
If you want to live your life
according to a single message, go ahead.
But try John 13:34 instead.
"A new command I give you.
Love one another.
As I have loved you,
you must love one another."
The best way for you to do that is to put that gun down.
Paul, you are a victim.
And there are others being
victimized right now that you can help.
Wouldn't Mitchell want you to do everything possible
to make sure that nobody else suffered your same fate?
Come on.
Put it down.
Who can tell me the first stage? Anton.
Pidgin.
Pidgin is correct, Mr. Slavsky.
Pidgin.
This is when non-native speakers
use phrases from the mainstream language
in a broken manner,
usually resulting in a overly literal translation.
