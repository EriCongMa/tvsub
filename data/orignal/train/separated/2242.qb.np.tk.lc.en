第十六集
once upon a time , an evil queen
banished every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known
to our world .
who knows the truth
and who can break the spell ?
you don &apos;t play with the curse .
there is no place for us together .
if i drink that , i &apos;ll no longer love him ?
you won &apos;t even remember who he is .
i told him they should be together .
bring me his head !
come on !
it &apos;s been 24 hours since kathryn went missing .
there &apos;s a human heart inside it .
we found fingerprints . they were mary margaret &apos;s .
red , look out !
we need to move . they found us .
go . i &apos;ll take care of them .
red , i &apos;m not leaving you .
find snow . that &apos;s all that matters . find her !
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m giving you a head start .
please turn to the right .
emma , this is a mistake . i didn &apos;t kill kathryn .
of course you didn &apos;t .
but while i am your friend , i am also the sheriff ,
and i have to go where the evidence leads .
which points to me ?
emma , yesterday it was david .
there &apos;s something not right here .
i know , but your fingerprints were on that box ,
and his are not ...
so now we have to deal with ... this .
evidence that says i cut out kathryn &apos;s heart
and buried it in the woods ? this is insane .
if i don &apos;t book you , with all this evidence ,
it &apos;s gonna look like favoritism .
and then regina will have cause and she will fire me ,
and then you know what she &apos;ll do ?
she &apos;ll bring in someone who will railroad you .
so please , just try to be patient and trust me .
we can &apos;t even move forward till we verify
the heart belonged to kathryn ,
and i am still waiting for the dna test results .
but in the meantime , you need to bear with me .
i have to ask you a few questions .
this is crazy .
i would never hurt anyone .
snow ? what are you--
what are you doing ?
getting rid of the vermin in this house .
what do you want ?
it &apos;s dinnertime .
i &apos;m not hungry .
come on .
we made something extra special tonight .
she &apos;s out of control .
somebody died ?
snow , why don &apos;t you have a seat ?
oh ! why is there a dirty cricket in here ?
uh , my name is jiminy ,
and your friends have asked me to be here tonight .
they &apos;re concerned about you
and they have something they &apos;d like to say .
grumpy , why don &apos;t you start ?
&quot; snow white ,
&quot; you &apos;ve changed .
you &apos;ve become angry , irritable , and downright mean . &quot;
changed ?
and who are you to tell me i &apos;ve changed ?
snow , please , these are your friends ,
and we &apos;re all here because we--we care about you .
who wants to go next ?
&quot; you brought bales of straw into the house last night .
even though you know that i &apos;m a ...
allergic . &quot;
you are allergic to everything .
you broke my mug !
you &apos;re lucky it wasn &apos;t that mug you call a face !
you are the worst , most nasty , horrible--
enough ! look what you &apos;re doing to happy .
that potion you took--
the one that erased the prince from your mind--
you haven &apos;t been the same since you drank it .
that helped me forget whatever or whomever i needed to forget ,
and i am clearly better off for it .
that potion was the solution , not the problem .
the problem is that i &apos;m living here ,
in a house full of dwarves instead of in my palace ,
with my father , as a princess ,
but i can &apos;t do that anymore , can i ?
because he was murdered ,
murdered by the same woman
who sent a huntsman to kill me !
snow , your anger towards the queen is understandable .
it &apos;s just not fair to take it out on your friends .
you &apos;re right .
i should be taking it out on her .
oh , wait . revenge is not the answer .
no , it &apos;s gonna change you .
it &apos;ll turn you into something darker than you can imagine .
you don &apos;t want to go there .
oh , no , no .
good news , fellas
you can quit your complaining , because i &apos;m leaving .
i have more important things to do .
wait . don &apos;t go !
snow .
don &apos;t do this !
wait .
no !
where are you going ?
to kill the queen .
hello , ms. blanchard .
what is she doing here ?
she asked to be here as a third party
to make sure that i stay impartial .
it can only help you .
i have nothing to hide .
ask me anything .
the heart was found buried near the old toll bridge .
it had been cut out by what appears to be a hunting knife .
have you ever been to that bridge before ?
yes . many times .
it &apos;s where david and i liked to meet .
mr. nolan .
yes .
and you met there ...
for what purpose ?
we were having an affair .
i &apos;m not proud of what happened .
and i &apos;m sorry , but that doesn &apos;t change the fact
that i did not kill kathryn .
ever seen this before ?
yes . it &apos;s my jewelry box .
that &apos;s what we found the heart in .
don &apos;t you see what &apos;s happening here ?
someone stole that box and put the heart in it .
i didn &apos;t have anything to do with it . i &apos;m innocent !
ms. blanchard ,
it &apos;s okay .
i know what you &apos;re going through .
i know what it &apos;s like to lose someone you love ,
to be publicly humiliated .
it put me in a very dark place ,
changed me .
i can only imagine what losing david nolan did to you .
but i haven &apos;t changed .
i &apos;m still the same person i &apos;ve always been ,
a good person .
i did not do this .
can i speak to you in the hallway , please ?
i told you to leave the questioning to me .
how do you know she didn &apos;t do it ?
if that box was stolen from her as she claims ,
don &apos;t you think there &apos;d be signs of a break @-@ in ?
you &apos;re her roommate . tell me .
has there been a break @-@ in ?
she is a woman who &apos;s had her heart broken ,
and that ...
that can make you do unspeakable things .
it &apos;ll heal ...
eventually .
what do you want ?
information . where &apos;s the queen ?
and why would i tell you ?
do you know what a diamond is ?
it &apos;s the strongest substance known to man or beast--
beautiful , precious ,
nearly impervious to destruction .
nearly .
this ...
this is an ax from the dwarf mines .
it &apos;s a special blade .
it can , believe it or not ,
actually cut a diamond .
imagine what it can do to human flesh ...
soft , pliable ,
tender flesh .
she &apos;s at her castle ,
but only for the night .
in the morning , she leaves for the summer palace .
please ! that &apos;s all i know .
that summer palace was built for my mother .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
i already told you .
i &apos;m going to kill the queen .
by stealing the armor off a knight ?
whatever i have to do to get into the castle .
so get out of my way .
i have to get there before she departs .
have you lost your mind ?
you really think this disguise is gonna fool anybody ?
i &apos;m getting in there .
listen to yourself !
all you care about is revenge .
you can &apos;t even see reality anymore .
what i don &apos;t need is
to be lectured by a dwarf with a bad attitude .
i didn &apos;t come here to lecture you .
i came here to help you .
help me ?
how ?
by taking you back to rumplestiltskin .
he &apos;s the one who gave you the potion in the first place ,
the one that took away all your memories of your prince .
if anyone can give &apos; em back to you , it &apos;s him .
i don &apos;t want my memories back . that &apos;s why i took the potion .
and it changed you .
maybe he can at least bring you back
to the person you used to be .
he &apos;s the most powerful man in the world .
he can do anything .
anything ?
henry . what are you doing here ?
why aren &apos;t you in school ?
we have to help ms. blanchard .
i am helping her . that &apos;s why i &apos;m searching the apartment .
but you gotta go home .
not gonna happen .
just stay out of the way .
so what are we looking for ?
i &apos;m trying to see if maybe someone broke in .
looking for busted doorjambs , broken glass ,
muddy boot prints-- that kind of thing .
so you think someone &apos;s setting her up .
it &apos;s the only thing that makes sense .
the only problem is nobody &apos;s got a motive .
my mom does .
regina ?
she hates snow white .
hey , you wanted a motive .
well , i don &apos;t think &quot; she hates snow white &quot;
will hold up in a court , henry .
did you find something ?
i don &apos;t think that hot chocolate &apos;s gonna drink itself .
you &apos;re upset about your teacher , aren &apos;t you ?
she didn &apos;t do it .
why can &apos;t anyone see it ?
cause most people just see what &apos;s right in front of them .
and i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna find the answers you want
at the bottom of that mug .
then where ?
that book in your bag ?
you know i &apos;m a writer .
so i &apos;m partialo finding my answers in the literary form .
it &apos;s just a book .
is it ?
yeah .
i think we both know that &apos;s not the case .
can i get a water please ?
what do you know about it ?
i know it &apos;s a book of stories .
aren &apos;t all books ?
stories ... that really happened .
you think my book is real ?
as real as i am .
how do you know ?
let &apos;s just say that , uh ... i &apos;m a believer ,
and i want to help others see the light .
that , my friend , that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
but i already believe .
oh , i &apos;m not here for you , buddy .
i &apos;m here for emma .
so you want to get her to believe ?
why don &apos;t you just tell her ?
well , there are some people-- like you and me--
we can go on faith ,
but others , like emma , they need proof .
last time i tried to find proof ,
i got trapped in a sinkhole .
there are less dangerous places to look .
put your hands where i can see &apos; em .
second thought , don &apos;t .
who did this ?
she &apos;s crazy . she had a pickax .
she threatened to skin me .
the evil queen ?
no . snow white .
what ?
she said she wanted to kill the queen .
i &apos;ve never seen someone so bloodthirsty .
no . snow is not bloodthirsty .
she is not a killer . i know her .
maybe you don &apos;t .
hey . can i talk to you ?
of course .
these accusations against mary margaret--
they &apos;ve been gnawing away at me .
she didn &apos;t do this .
i understand what you &apos;re going through .
it &apos;s painful when someone we care about betrays us .
she &apos;s a good person . i know her .
maybe you don &apos;t .
maybe you just want to .
everyone has a dark side , david .
yeah , sure , but having a dark side
and doing something so evil--
that &apos;s a different thing . that &apos;s not what she is .
perhaps .
i always believe that evil isn &apos;t born .
it &apos;s made .
all due respect , regina ,
i don &apos;t think you know much about evil .
well , if she didn &apos;t do it , then who did ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been trying to figure out .
but those blackouts i &apos;ve been having--
they made everything so hazy .
please tell me you &apos;re not accusing yourself .
you know , maybe if i could clear up my missing time ,
i could prove mary margaret &apos;s innocence .
you &apos;re very sweet , david .
but you &apos;re also wrong .
evil doesn &apos;t always look evil .
sometimes it &apos;s staring right at us ,
and we don &apos;t even realize it .
the heating vent ?
emma , i don &apos;t even know
where the heating vent in my bedroom is .
well , someone did , and they put a hunting knife in there .
i checked for signs of a break @-@ in ,
but there weren &apos;t any .
you don &apos;t believe me .
of course i do .
but what i think doesn &apos;t matter .
the evidence is piling up by the hour .
okay , what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying you should think about hiring a lawyer .
an excellent idea .
mr. gold .
what are you doing here ?
offering my legal services .
you &apos;re a lawyer ?
ever wondered why i was so adept at contracts ?
i &apos;ve been following the details of your case , ms. blanchard .
and i think you &apos;d be well @-@ advised
to bring me on as your counsel .
and why is that ?
well , because the sheriff had me arrested
for nearly beating a man to death ,
and i managed to persuade the judge to drop the charges .
asserting your influence isn &apos;t what &apos;s needed here .
we need to find the truth .
exerting influence may be exactly what &apos;s needed here .
what &apos;s needed here is for me to do my job .
well , no one &apos;s stopping you . i &apos;m only here to help .
enough .
please go .
you heard her .
no , i was talking to you .
oh , emma , he &apos;s right . i need help .
and you need to do your job , or else i &apos;m screwed .
so just please ,
do your job the best you can ,
and you &apos;ll prove me innocent .
until you do , i need some practical help .
trust me .
this is in ms. blanchard &apos;s best interests .
good luck , mary margaret .
i hope your best interests
are what he &apos;s looking out for .
i can &apos;t pay you .
i didn &apos;t ask for money .
then why are you doing this ?
let &apos;s just say ...
i &apos;m invested in your future .
the potion you gave snow--
it changed her . she &apos;s not the same .
well , of course it changed her .
it took away her love ,
left a big hole in her heart .
there is no cure for what she &apos;s got .
the person she was ...
there &apos;s no way to bring her back .
no potion can bring back true love .
love ...
is the most powerful magic of all ,
the only magic i haven &apos;t been able to bottle .
if you can bottle love ,
you can do anything .
but you don &apos;t care about that , do ya ?
now what is it you really want ?
i want your help ...
to kill the queen .
now we &apos;re talking , dearie .
snow , don &apos;t .
now what is this ?
this ... is how you kill the queen .
how will that help me get into the castle ?
no , no , no . that &apos;s impossible .
you have to kill her when she &apos;s on the move ,
when she &apos;s on her way ...
to the summer palace .
fire the arrow from this spot here ,
and you &apos;ll be hidden from sight .
an arrow fired from this bow
will give you exactly what you need .
it always finds its target .
i can &apos;t stand by .
if you take that weapon , you do it alone .
that was always my plan .
so what do i have to do in return ?
do ?
you don &apos;t have to do anything , dearie .
everything comes with a price with you .
last time you took a strand of my hair .
what &apos;s in it for you this time ?
let &apos;s just say ...
i &apos;m invested in your future .
david . what can i do for you ?
dr. hopper , i need your help .
okay . what--what is it ?
i &apos;ve been having these blackouts ,
and i need to remember what happened during them .
why ?
i think i might know something that can help mary margaret .
rumplestiltskin !
show yourself .
still dressing like a prince , i see ,
even though you ran away from the life i gave you .
how &apos;s that for gratitude ?
you gave me a prison sentence .
yeah , one that you &apos;ve now skirted .
careful , dearie .
king george is a vengeful man ,
i &apos;m here about snow .
rumor has it she &apos;s after the queen
and she came to you for help .
yes , indeed .
what did you do to her ?
what did i do to her ?
you mean what did you do to her .
you caused her pain .
without that pain ,
she would never have drank my potion to forget about you .
that &apos;s what changed her .
undo the potion . all magic can be broken .
oh , yes , with two wuv .
so that &apos;s it then ? true love &apos;s kiss will awaken her .
most certainly .
but it &apos;s gonna be hard to kiss her
when you don &apos;t know where she is .
name your price .
how about ...
your cloak ?
my cloak ? why would you want my cloak ?
it &apos;s drafty in here .
where is she ?
on her way to the queen &apos;s highway .
this is the route she &apos;s taking .
but you better be quick ,
because if she kills the queen ,
she becomes as evil
as the woman whose life she takes .
she could never become that evil
evil isn &apos;t born , dearie .
it &apos;s made .
if snow starts down that road
you &apos;ll get her back !
get your hands off me !
snow .
who are you ? what are you doing ? !
i &apos;m helping you remember .
i told you , i will always find you .
i have proof .
this is how my mom got into your apartment .
this is how she framed ms. blanchard .
did you steal these from her office ?
yeah .
the book said they could open any door .
there &apos;s no way they &apos;ll even fit in the lock .
we have to try .
see ? what did i tell you ?
come on , henry . i know you want to think
the answer to everything is in operation cobra .
it is !
but sometimes the real world needs to come first .
just try one more .
please .
okay , one more , but then we &apos;re done .
you do it .
this one .
okay .
do you believe now ?
i assume you &apos;re the man
rumplestiltskin helped me forget .
what &apos;s your name again ?
it &apos;s me , charming .
charming ?
beginning to see why i drank that potion .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
true love &apos;s kiss should &apos;ve restored your memories .
it &apos;s not true love ...
because i don &apos;t love you .
yes , you do . you just don &apos;t remember .
you love me , and i love you .
words . words . words .
that &apos;s all that love is .
and unfortunately for you ,
words don &apos;t mean anything to me .
you know what does mean somemething to me ?
taking action , and that &apos;s exactly
what i &apos;m going to go do .
snow .
snow , listen to me !
you can &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s not who you want to be . you can &apos;t kill her .
really ?
watch me .
don &apos;t do it !
snow !
snow !
david , listen very closely . can you hear me ?
yes .
good .
okay , i want you to go back in your memory ,
back to the last time you and kathryn spoke ,
the last thing you remember .
tell me--where are you ?
in my bedroom .
when ?
the night she left .
and what were you doing ?
i called her on her cell .
and what did you talk about ?
she said she realized she needed to start a new life ,
without me .
she thought mary margaret and i should be together .
and how did that conversation end ?
she said she was hurt ...
but she wanted me to be happy .
and do you remember anything after that ?
yes .
i saw mary margaret in the woods .
and what was she doing there ?
you can &apos;t kill her .
really ?
watch me .
don &apos;t do it .
david .
david !
what happened ?
i had to wake you up . you went too deep into hypnosis .
something was disturbing you . what did you see ?
it was ...
what ?
tell me , david . i can help you .
david .
david , tell me . what did you see ? i can help you .
no , you can &apos;t .
david !
come on . get out of here .
you must be james .
you can talk ?
yeah , and you can listen . name &apos;s jiminy .
when snow began acting differently ,
her friends the dwarves asked me to intervene ,
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m afraid i @-@ i wasn &apos;t much help .
i didn &apos;t do any better .
can you get me out of here ? i have to stop her .
well , i &apos;ll try .
what &apos;s your plan ?
i don &apos;t know .
i tried everything to make her remember who i am ,
but nothing worked .
give that a try .
it sounds like you &apos;re approaching this the wrong way ,
how can she remember who you are
when she &apos;s lost sight of who she is ?
clear the road !
bow your heads before the queen !
what do you think you &apos;re doing ? !
why would you do this ? !
well , because ...
you said you appreciate ... action more than words .
so now ...
you &apos;re gonna get both .
i love you , snow .
but i don &apos;t love you .
i don &apos;t even remember you .
well , i don &apos;t care .
the only thing i care about
is that you don &apos;t forget who you really are .
i would rather die than let you fill your heart with darkness .
you would really die for me ?
does it look like i &apos;m making this up ?
no one &apos;s ever done anything like this for me before .
no one &apos;s ever been willing to die for me .
no one you can remember .
charming .
yes .
it &apos;s me .
king george &apos;s army .
halt !
no ! oh !
prince james .
leave the girl .
we have who we came for .
no !
james !
no !
enough !
snow .
snow !
james !
snow !
i will find you !
i will always find you .
mary margaret .
david .
emma said we could have a few minutes alone .
i wanted to tell you that dr. hopper helped me
remember what happened during my blackouts .
and ?
i only , um ...
got pieces of the memory , but ...
we were in the woods ,
and i kept saying , &quot; don &apos;t do it . &quot;
don &apos;t do what ?
&quot; don &apos;t kill her . &quot;
that &apos;s what i kept saying .
kathryn ?
you think you remember me wanting to kill kathryn ?
can you explain why i have that memory ?
david ...
are you asking me if i had something to do
with kathryn &apos;s murder ?
the sheriff found a heart in our spot .
it was in your jewelry box .
the weapon was found in your apartment .
i have have these ... these memories .
so , yes , i &apos;m asking .
when your phone records came back ,
when i found you wandering in the woods ,
when everyone thought you killed kathryn ,
i stood by you .
i never once doubted you .
and now that everything is pointing to me ...
you actually think that i am capable of that kind of evil ?
get ... out .
what &apos;s this ?
an apology .
we don &apos;t care about mugs .
it &apos;s the only thing i broke that i could replace .
i &apos;m sorry .
all i can say is ...
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s you .
it &apos;s me .
oh , welcome back .
thank you .
you can have your old room if you like .
oh . thank you .
i can &apos;t stay .
where are you going ?
king george took james .
i have to get him back .
no , snow , you can &apos;t do it .
i can &apos;t let the king just kill him .
he came back for me . it doesn &apos;t matter what happens to me now .
i have to try .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
what i meant was
you can &apos;t do it alone .
but luckily , you won &apos;t have to .
let &apos;s show that king
what snow white and seven dwarves can really do !
hey . breakfast .
thanks .
i know mr. gold doesn &apos;t want us to talk ,
but i thought you should hear this from me .
the test results came back on the heart ,
and the d.n.a. was a match for kathryn .
she &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m sorry ...
for a lot of things .
but now that we have proof of the death ,
we have enough evidence
to move forward with a case against you .
it &apos;s gonna happen .
you know i do believe you , right ?
yeah .
all this evidence tells me one thing for certain--
that you are being framed ,
and i think regina &apos;s behind it .
then why am i still in here ? why don &apos;t you confront her ?
because belief is not proof .
but you just said .
if i don &apos;t do this right ,
things will end up worse for you .
every time i &apos;ve gone up against regina ,
she &apos;s seen it coming , and i &apos;ve lost .
so what makes this time any different ?
because she doesn &apos;t know i suspect anything .
why would she do this to me ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m gonna find out ,
and i promise , i won &apos;t stop until i expose what she &apos;s up to .
and how are you going to do that ? this is her town .
i &apos;m working on it .
i have faith in you .
and now i need you
to have faith in me .
can you do that ?
of course .
mr. gold .
just taking inventory .
what can i do for you , ms. swan ?
any developments in the case i should be aware of ?
yes . regina set her up .
and this surprises you ?
show me your evidence , and we &apos;ll get this over with immediately .
yeah . that &apos;s the thing . there isn &apos;t any--
anything that &apos;s court @-@ worthy .
but i know it now .
look who &apos;s suddenly become a woman of faith .
why are you here , ms. swan ? to spin conspiracy theories ?
i need help .
from me ?
every time i &apos;ve gone up against regina , i &apos;ve lost ,
except for once , when i became sheriff ,
when you helped .
as i recall , you don &apos;t exactly approve of my methods .
i approve of your results .
and this time , i have something more important than a job .
i need to save my friend .
and you &apos;re willing to go as far as it takes ?
farther .
now we &apos;re talking .
fear not , ms swan .
regina may be powerful ,
but something tells me
