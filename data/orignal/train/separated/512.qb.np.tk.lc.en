protection
is somebody there ?
it &apos;s me .
are you ok ?
is your mom here ?
mom ?
yeah , baby .
oh , my god .
danny , what happened ?
jj !
hey , hold on for a second .
garcia &apos;s calling .
hey , baby girl , what &apos;s good ?
hooray ! happy breathing ?
i wasn &apos;t invited . what &apos;s the occasion ?
i was just having a run with jj .
ohh , that &apos;s boring . see , couldn &apos;t you just make something up ,
satiate my fabulous , filthy imagination ?
cut it out . what &apos;s going on ?
you got something for us ?
uh , yeah . hate to ruin your saturday afternoon ,
but pack your champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
you got a case out in tinseltown .
oh , come on , garcia ,
we &apos;re at least 4 miles from the car right now .
well , the flight is super long
and hotch wants everyone to meet on the plane ,
so get your hustle on .
all right . give us the highlights .
oh , yes , i can do that happily .
although it &apos;s not a happy thing
since there are 3 murder victims in the last 3 days .
ok , so , nate cochran , 46 , was found this morning .
he &apos;s an accountant , lives in van nuys ,
married , two children .
with him was tasha brooks ,
22 years old , prostitute , crack addict .
no known address or family .
they were found in nate &apos;s bmw .
they were shot multiple times about the chest , head , and neck ,
but mostly in the face .
what about the third victim ?
oh , he was actually the very first victim .
his name is gary fisher .
he was shot in his jaguar 13 times , also in the face .
he was 42 . he was a banker .
uh , he lived in studio city . divorced .
ballistics are an exact match to the victims found this morning .
beemer and a jag . they left the car .
hey , garcia , did they take any money or valuables ?
negative . nothing .
and this fisher guy was found alone ?
yes , but he was found in an area
known for blow pops and backdoor quickies .
all right , we &apos;re on our way .
happy trails , my heroes .
race you .
danny ? you in there ?
i can hear you crying .
i can hear you all the way from my room .
you got another headache ?
you , uh , want me to do the thing again ?
how bad is it ?
it &apos;s bad .
worse than last time ?
thank you .
patricia &apos;s mad at me .
we &apos;re not just your tenants , you know .
she &apos;s your friend and she doesn &apos;t want you to get hurt .
neither do i.
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know why this is so hard .
the right thing to do is always the hardest thing to do ,
and you &apos;re doing the right thing .
i just miss my mom so much .
that &apos;s why you have to keep going
and find that son of a bitch who took her away from you .
the whole world needs help , danny .
somebody has to be there ,
just like you &apos;re here for us .
shh ... it &apos;s ok .
it hurts so bad .
&quot; it is a man &apos;s own mind ,
&quot; not his enemy or foe ,
that lures him to evil ways . &quot;
buddha .
so two johns and a hooker
and no apparent connection between any of them .
and he doesn &apos;t rob them or care if the bodies are discovered .
no forensic countermeasures either .
he probably wants them found .
it might be a message .
i wonder what he &apos;s trying to say .
maybe that he &apos;s angry .
he &apos;s using a .45 @-@ caliber weapon ,
and with each victim he fired 13 shots .
it &apos;s most likely every round in the magazine
and the one in the chamber .
it &apos;s basically overkill with a handgun .
what &apos;s he angry about ?
tasha brooks is african @-@ american
and the two johns , gary fisher
and nate cochran , they were both white .
guys , what if she &apos;s the connection ?
what if these victims were both her clients ?
given the close proximity of the murder sites ,
that is a distinct possibility .
so the first victim , gary gisher , was found alone
because maybe tasha was there and then got away ?
or it was some other girl and she got away .
presuming it is a woman .
either way , that means there &apos;s someone out there
that may have seen the unsub .
then our first priority should be finding that person .
i can &apos;t thank all of you enough for coming .
well , i hope we can help .
we put all our street patrols on double shifts like you asked .
we rounded up every working girl ,
pimp , crackhead in the area .
hopefully somebody knows something .
we better get to it . we &apos;re gonna need to talk to &apos; em all .
well , it won &apos;t be easy .
i saw this all the time when i worked sex crimes .
most of these women have been victimized for years .
why don &apos;t we start with him .
eddie parrish , tasha brooks &apos; pimp .
calls himself sweetness .
aw , come on , now . that was walter payton &apos;s nickname .
that &apos;s just wrong .
like i told the cop that dragged me up here ,
i work in a car wash .
you &apos;ve been picked up for pandering before , eddie .
two years probation and 100 hours of community service .
car wash .
those are bank statements
from one mabel parrish .
that ring a bell ? reno , nevada .
yo , what y &apos;all doin &apos; with my mama &apos;s banks statements , man ?
looks like a few months ago , right after you got off probation ,
she starting making some cash deposits .
and the weird thing is ,
it &apos;s way more than she makes at that hair salon .
now , i assume the i.r.s. is aware of it ,
but you never know
what they &apos;re gonna find if they dig a little deeper .
y &apos;all better leave my mama alone , all right ?
come on , now , sweetness ,
you know the deal .
gotta play ball .
&apos;aight .
what y &apos;all want to know about tasha ?
i ain &apos;t seen her since tuesday .
and she hasn &apos;t been returning your texts or your voicemails , has she ?
damn , is there anything y &apos;all don &apos;t know ?
what y &apos;all need me for ?
we need you to tell us who killed her .
who killed her ?
she dead ?
ah , nah , nah , nah , nah .
you--you don &apos;t think it was me , do you ?
should we ?
i didn &apos;t kill nobody , man .
no , no , no , no , no , no ,
i swear to god . i got alibis .
come on , man , what you show me this for ?
we found her with him .
i know that dude .
he &apos;s a regular .
what about that guy ?
nah . i ain &apos;t never seen him .
you sure about that ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure about that . i ain &apos;t never seen him .
i don &apos;t forget no faces .
whoa , whoa , wait , wait , wait , wait .
this is over there by the river .
tasha never got down there .
too far . bad cell signal .
y &apos;all need to talk to the girls that work east of alameda .
now , can you get these pictures out of my face , man .
you usually work east of alameda , over by the river ?
you ever seen this man ?
are you sure ? do you want to maybe take another look ?
i &apos;m sure , baby .
i remember all the cute ones .
like you .
i won &apos;t forget you or your friend either .
lizette castro ? i &apos;m agent jareau ,
this is agent callahan .
am i under arrest ?
did you do something wrong ?
no .
we just want to ask you a few questions .
that your first one ?
oh , um , technically , yes .
i have a 13 @-@ year @-@ old at home . it &apos;s a long story .
then you should try those seasickness bracelets .
they got magnets in &apos; em .
worked for me .
thanks .
so , lizette , um , do you ever work east of aalameda ,
over by the river ?
it &apos;s ok .
uh , yeah , sometimes .
have you ever seen this man before ?
no .
no .
never .
you sure ?
i &apos;m positive .
were you working last saturday ?
no , i was home .
is that it ?
are we done ?
you in a hurry ?
yeah , i gotta go pick up my son from my sister &apos;s house .
if you don &apos;t mind taking one more look at the picture .
i already told you , i &apos;ve never seen him before .
can i go now ?
i &apos;m not under arrest , right ?
no .
ok .
you should eat something .
i &apos;m not hungry .
and maybe drink less .
it helps his headaches .
is that true ?
yeah , sometimes .
mom , you shouldn &apos;t make him feel so bad .
look at him . he &apos;s drunk . he can &apos;t go out there .
he &apos;s fine .
i can hear you guys .
we &apos;re just worried about you .
i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;m not . you really scared me last night .
all that blood .
i just don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
i &apos;m sorry , but you know i have to find that son of a bitch ,
especially before he finds you .
and when i saw those disgusting whores ,
i couldn &apos;t just ...
i had to do something .
this is our neighborhood .
we live here .
just be careful , ok ?
promise me ?
i promise .
do you want a ride ?
no . thank you .
i can get you there a lot faster than the bus .
come on , it &apos;s late , all right ?
i just want to help you .
快点 我要去上班了
thanks .
not a problem .
where to ?
oh , you can just take a left up here .
so , um , how old &apos;s your little boy ?
6 .
oh , mine , too .
what &apos;s his name ?
santiago .
we call him santi .
until i had a kid , i didn &apos;t know
i could miss someone so bad .
it &apos;s hard when you gotta work all the time .
you know what , lizette ?
doing this job , sometimes you get feelings about people ,
and the one thing i &apos;ve learned
is that when you get that feeling , you better listen .
you know what i &apos;m feeling about you ?
you &apos;re stressed out .
you were caught in a bad situation
and you are scared .
mostly for santi .
so when i showed you that picture , you lied ,
because you thought that was the best way to protect him ,
but it &apos;s not .
telling the truth
is the only way to keep him safe .
i can help you , ok ? i can .
but you have to trust me .
ok , i lied .
i didn &apos;t do it , ok ?
you have to believe me . he was being crazy .
i thought he was gonna kill me .
ok . ok . calm down . calm down .
just tell me what happened .
ok , uh , the man that you showed me
picked me up last saturday .
uh , we went over by the river
and we got in the backseat .
suddenly the window was smashed .
he started pulling him from the car
and he was kicking his ass and yelling at him .
what was he saying ?
you stay out of my city !
i don &apos;t know , he kept telling him to stay out of his city .
did you get a good look at him ?
he was wearing a hoodie , but i &apos;m pretty sure he was white .
stay down !
he just started shooting , and i ran .
please , i did not have anything to do with it .
you have to believe me .
please don &apos;t take my son away from me . please--
no , no . no one is gonna take your son .
ok ?
just be careful , ok ?
promise me ?
help !
help ! help !
stop !
are--are you-- are you ok ?
are you shot ? did i shoot you ?
no , no , no . no , no , no , no , no .
please don &apos;t die . pl @-@ please don &apos;t die .
this is all your fault .
you &apos;re just like him .
kid &apos;s name is lamar taylor . weed dealer , car thief .
we &apos;ve picked him up a bunch of times .
.45 @-@ caliber shells .
gotta be our guy , right ?
yeah , but this crime scene &apos;s total chaos .
look at this guy . more than just shot ,
he &apos;s been beaten to a pulp .
the others weren &apos;t this bad .
well , he &apos;s escalating .
he &apos;s either getting more angry or losing control .
or both . he might also be on drugs .
this has gotta be her purse .
i wonder if he was trying to snatch it .
this neighborhood ? that &apos;s a good bet .
well , her name is clara miller , 68 @-@ year @-@ old
retired schoolteacher .
guys , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s shot anywhere .
i don &apos;t see blood , nothing .
maybe he hit her in the head .
i don &apos;t see anything like that right here .
heart disease .
i don &apos;t get it .
first hookers and johns and now these two .
kid tries to steal an old lady &apos;s purse ,
unsub runs up on her , kills the kid .
old lady has a heart attack . i think i know what this is .
i &apos;m right with you .
we should deliver the profile .
we &apos;re looking for who we believe is a white male in his 20s .
he &apos;s what we call a moral enforcer ,
which is a vigilante of sorts .
an autopsy on one of the victims
showed evidence of postmortem violence .
this speaks to the unsub &apos;s level of anger .
he began by victimizing prostitutes and their clients ,
and he &apos;s moved on to what we believe is a mugging situation .
he &apos;s mission oriented .
in his mind , he may believe
it &apos;s his duty to clean up the streets .
he probably does nightly patrols
and stalks anyone that he thinks is suspicious .
not only is it possible he may suffer
from some kind of drug @-@ related psychosis ,
but we think he also may have been a victim of violent crime himself .
and this appears to be personal , which makes him more dangerous .
he &apos;s gaining confidence with every kill .
and as his confidence grows ,
so will his belief in his cause .
he lives in the area and he probably grew up here ,
but we think he &apos;s severely antisocial .
he probably couldn &apos;t hold down more than a part @-@ time job .
unfortunately , the statistics
do not support this ending well .
in the vast majority of these type of serial crimes ,
the murderer usually doesn &apos;t go down easily
and isn &apos;t apprehended alive .
but so far he &apos;s been smart enough to run away
before the cops show up .
even though he &apos;s a vigilante , he may not think
we &apos;re all on the same team catching the bad guy together .
in fact , his zeal may be connected
to a deep mistrust of law enforcement .
so we need you to tell the working girls , your informants ,
anyone else out on the street , to keep a lookout .
and , please , proceed with extreme caution .
this guys is strapped with a .45 @-@ caliber
and he &apos;s not afraid to use it .
so if you think you have a line on him , do not try to be a hero .
call for backup .
all right , guys , let &apos;s get to it .
you were so cute .
she was a great lady , your mom .
i remember when we first moved in .
i never knew a landlord could be so nice .
it &apos;s not fair .
she should still be here .
she didn &apos;t deserve that .
life &apos;s not fair , danny .
i know that !
i know .
i get that you &apos;re hurting ,
but you don &apos;t need to take it out on us .
we miss her , too , you know .
well , it &apos;s your fault he was even around .
don &apos;t you dare blame me for this .
he was your ex . he was here looking for you .
you should be the one that &apos;s dead .
that went well .
you know what might make you feel better ?
cleaning this place up .
it stinks .
i &apos;m actually wrong , you know ?
it should have been me .
don &apos;t say that .
everything happens for a reason .
if it was you that got shot that night ,
who would protect us , huh ?
that animal is still out there
and the cops don &apos;t even care .
you &apos;re the only one that &apos;s gonna find him , danny .
you &apos;re doing the right thing .
your mom would be proud of you .
go ahead , garcia .
sir , per your request ,
i did some delving into the latest victims ,
and , uh , get ready for a big paradigm shift
regarding the personality of lamar taylor .
he was a bad kid , operative word , was .
present tense now , he was in his first semester
at a local community college ,
and clara miller , the woman ,
she was his high school teacher .
he was a super at @-@ risk kid , he had trouble at home ,
and clara helped him . she helped him through school .
she helped him graduate .
so there &apos;s no way that was a mugging .
no . no . unless it &apos;s some sort of , you know , bizarro universe ,
with a square planet ,
where things are like exactly the opposite , totally the same .
black kid , white lady .
he probably racially profiled the situation
and just jumped to conclusions .
we need to alert the press and warn the public .
thanks , garcia .
thanks for coming .
what do you think ? i cleaned it up .
we .
we . right . we . we cleaned it up .
it looks great .
these are for you .
i &apos;m sorry for what i said . i didn &apos;t mean it .
the roses make your eyes look beautiful .
i mean , they &apos;re already beautiful eyes .
i just mean , with the flowers , they &apos;re ...
more beautiful .
thank you .
you &apos;re forgiven .
i know it &apos;s been tough .
i &apos;m gonna go put these in water before i go to work .
patricia ,
please don &apos;t go to work .
it &apos;s too dangerous . he &apos;s still out there .
i can &apos;t keep calling in sick . they &apos;re gonna fire me .
so what ? it &apos;s better than ending up like my mom .
but , danny , i have to work .
what if you didn &apos;t have to pay rent ?
what are you talking about ?
the house is paid for , right ? and i don &apos;t want your money .
and with what i make at the restaurant , i could feed us all .
you would do that for us ?
i would do anything for you .
ok .
but only until you find him .
we &apos;re not freeloaders .
i know .
thank you .
nice job .
thanks for the advice .
just stick with me , kid .
good afternoon . i &apos;m ssa jennifer jareau .
due to a recent string of shooting deaths ,
we now have reason to believe a vigilante is on the loose .
we are warning everyone to be on the lookout
and to report any suspicious behavior .
we believe this man is a caucasian in his 20s .
he is armed and very dangerous .
wow . are they , uh , talking about you ?
that had to be about you , right ?
they don &apos;t understand . i &apos;m trying to help .
if they would just do their jobs ,
i wouldn &apos;t need to do it for them .
be extra careful tonight .
and do not tell my mom about this .
you got a problem , bro ?
what are you lookin &apos; at ?
be extra careful .
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought .
walk away , bitch .
stop !
no ! don &apos;t !
no ! stop ! stop !
stop ! stop ! stop !
you want to rape girls , you son of a bitch ?
get him ! get him ! make it fast !
yeah . kill him . kill him !
right now !
her name &apos;s lindsey cooper .
some bouncer called 911
after she ran into a night club screaming for help .
what about the victim ?
his name was christopher deluca .
shot multiple times , beaten pretty badly , too .
apparently he was her boyfriend .
they found shell casings from a .45 on the scene .
she told cops that the shooter was
a white guy wearing a hoodie .
spreewell and his guys are canvassing the area .
he left a witness this time . he &apos;s getting sloppy .
is she in any condition to talk ?
she looks pretty freaked out .
she keeps clenching her jaw , drinking water ,
and can &apos;t seem to sit still . i think she &apos;s on something ,
and i &apos;m assuming it &apos;s mdma .
all right , kate ,
you and jj see what you can find out from her .
and , reid , you and morgan go to the crime scene .
thanks .
lindsey , i &apos;m jennifer . i &apos;m with the fbi .
hi , i &apos;m kate .
can i get you anything ?
more water , please .
you all right ?
look , we know that this all has you pretty freaked out .
and i &apos;m sure it probably doesn &apos;t help that your heart is still
racing from the molly you popped earlier .
but we need your help .
what happened tonight ?
chris and i went out .
you &apos;re right , he had some molly .
i don &apos;t know what ...
i started rolling really hard , and we went outside
and we smoked a cigarette , and we were kissing .
this guy came out of nowhere
and he started beating on chris .
he was screaming . he thought i was being raped .
you want to rape girls , you son of a bitch ? !
stop ! he &apos;s not raping me !
i told him he wasn &apos;t .
stop , please .
please don &apos;t . please , that &apos;s my boyfriend .
i told him to stop and he wouldn &apos;t .
please !
he took out a gun and he started shooting him .
no !
i didn &apos;t know what else to do . i just ...
i left my boyfriend there and i just ran .
lindsey , did you get a good look at him ?
good enough to describe to a sketch artist ?
composite sketch of the unsub .
i already went wide to the press .
best lead we &apos;ve had so far .
crime scene was total chaos .
ballistics confirmed another exact match .
guys , something doesn &apos;t add up .
we profiled this unsub would
have an intimate knowledge of his kill zone .
right ? but so far he &apos;s chosen impoverished neighborhoods
with high crime rates .
last night , he chose a neighborhood
that &apos;s been recently gentrified
and has a relatively low crime rate .
why the shift ?
he &apos;s getting more and more bold .
or he &apos;s losing his grip on reality .
maybe this isn &apos;t drug related .
what if this guy &apos;s actually delusional ,
as in the paranoid schizophrenic variety ?
so this could be a psychotic break .
that &apos;s possible .
his vigilante mission could have become his sole focus
and now he &apos;s seeing trouble wherever he looks for it .
then his delusions are driving him .
explains the shift in victimology .
now anyone could be a target to him .
excuse me .
no , no , no , no . you stay away from me .
you ok ?
what happened ?
i told you to stay away from me ! you didn &apos;t listen !
oh , my god , what did you do ? !
he was gonna arrest me .
arrest you ? what are you talking about ?
the mailman ?
are you seeing things again , danny ?
no , no , no , no , no , no .
are you taking your meds ?
no , i hate them .
ohh , danny . we have to go to the police .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
they can help .
no , no , no , no .
no , no , i said no !
we can &apos;t trust them . they &apos;re useless . you know that .
danny , if you don &apos;t call them , i will .
what ?
you need help .
you &apos;re not calling anybody .
danny .
okey @-@ dokey , artichokey in the pokey ,
victims of violent crime in los angeles over the last 5 years .
that is one honkin &apos; list .
we are talking tens of thousands of names .
all right , garcia ,
cross @-@ check that list against medical records .
anyone with mental health issues
that maybe have been prescribed antipsychotics .
specifically resperidone , olanzapine ,
haloperidol , clozapine
ok , ok , i got it . brain drugs , right .
ok , ok , that &apos;s a still unmanageable 2,948 names .
all right , now check within a 5 @-@ mile radius of the kill zone .
hey ! that &apos;s more like it . 6 names .
scratch that . two names
because two died and two moved out of state .
what &apos;s that leave us with ?
herman koldyke , 68 @-@ year @-@ old vietnam vet
with severe ptsd . he was stabbed during a robbery .
and sandra cunningham , 40 @-@ year @-@ old cashier ,
was bipolar , who was the victim of a rape .
those two don &apos;t exactly fit our profile .
do any of the 6 people on your
list have relatives that still live in the area ?
yes . one of the aforementioned deceased ,
miriam stokes , 50 @-@ year @-@ old landlord , with schizophrenia .
a year ago she was shot and killed in a burglary .
her son , daniel lee stokes ,
still lives in the building that she owned .
what else you got on this guy ?
uh , he &apos;s 24,
he works as a part @-@ time bus boy at a mexican restaurant--
with really good yelp reviews--
and he was diagnosed with
severe paranoid schizophrenia 3 years ago .
just like his mother .
oh , snap .
last week , daniel was questioned
regarding the disappearance of patricia valdez
and milena valdez , her 16 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
they lived in his building .
they disappeared two weeks ago . stokes was cleared .
garcia , did they ever catch the guy that shot his mom ?
no . no , never .
but , hello , thickening plot .
the prime suspect of said shooting
was patricia valdez &apos; ex , david ruiz .
he &apos;s currently in custody of the san diego sheriff &apos;s department
awaiting trial for armed robbery .
you got a picture of stokes ?
yeah . he &apos;s two years behind on his license renewal ,
but there you go .
garcia , we need an address .
you really think that guy had something to do with
that missing mother and daughter ?
let &apos;s hope not .
you got other units en route ?
yeah , two minutes out .
you and your boys take the back .
we &apos;re going in the front .
why are you doing this to us ?
that won &apos;t help . it &apos;ll only make it worse .
shut up ! i didn &apos;t ask you what you thought !
did i , patricia ?
patricia . he has them in there .
no , that &apos;s right , i did not .
it helps me with my headaches .
unlike you right now .
you leave mom out of this !
when ? !
tell me ! tell me when !
tell me ! tell me !
when your mom died ,
you promised you would take your meds .
you promised !
you &apos;re really scaring me , danny .
daniel lee stokes , this is the fbi .
we just want to ask you a few questions , daniel . is that ok ?
daniel , we know you &apos;re in there--
get back ! i &apos;ve got hostages !
don &apos;t do this . they &apos;ll kill you .
please stop . just let us go .
let you go ?
to them ?
they can &apos;t keep you safe . that &apos;s my job .
who &apos;s he yelling at ? i don &apos;t hear anyone else talking .
i love you ! can &apos;t you see that ?
i love you .
why can &apos;t you see that ?
all i ever tried to do was protect you .
all i ever tried to do was protect you !
daniel ?
is that patricia in there with you ?
you want to protect her ?
we can help you with that .
who &apos;s there ?
she &apos;s with me . we &apos;re still out here , daniel .
can you hear that ? there &apos;s more of us coming , man .
stay back !
ok , daniel , if you have patricia in there ,
you want to protect her ,
this is not the best way to do that .
how about milena , daniel , is she in there , too ?
yes , yes !
shh , shh ! quiet . shh !
don &apos;t speak .
daniel , we know about your mom .
shut up !
you don &apos;t know anything about her .
we know that she was shot in cold blood ,
and you &apos;re angry about it .
she--she didn &apos;t deserve that .
that animal is still out there !
no , daniel , we found him .
david ruiz , right ?
you &apos;re lying .
no , daniel , we found him in san diego .
i can take you right to him if you want ,
but you have to come out first .
we got units in the back ready to go in .
have them stand by .
all right , daniel , if you have patricia and milena in there ,
do the right thing and give yourself up .

hey , i need some shovels over here .
his mother must have helped him manage his illness ,
and after she was gone , it was only a matter of time
before he went off his meds and unraveled completely .
and i bet he blamed them for her murder .
a stressor like that , it &apos;s no surprise he eventually snapped .
he didn &apos;t care about his other victims .
why did he take the time to bury those two ?
it was probably before
his psychotic break became full @-@ blown .
he knew them personally . he probably even cared about them .
&quot; reality is merely an illusion ,
albeit a very persistent one . &quot;
albert einstein .

i have two pizzas and they &apos;ve just been delivered ,
which means they &apos;re extra delicious .
i smell mushrooms .
pepperoni . those from riggio &apos;s ?
yes , they are . i thought you guys would be hungry upon your arrival .
ooh , no , thanks . the smell grosses me out .
oh , my gosh ! i &apos;m so sorry . i had no idea .
no worries . this pregnancy thing can be freaky .
ok , there &apos;s--there &apos;s something you &apos;re not telling us .
yeah . i thought this would help you guys
with all the extra work you have to do right now .
whoa , whoa , what do you mean , extra work ?
what &apos;s going on ?
cruz called . he wants all the case assessments
for the congressional oversight meeting .

and he &apos;s gonna meet us at the concert .
