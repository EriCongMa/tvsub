family fun meeting by the front door , stat !
&quot; stat &quot; means right now !
ugh . what is it ?
ignore her . she &apos;s been in a bad mood all day .
and luke isn &apos;t home yet .
oh . i &apos;m right here .
where were you ?
this house still holds its secrets .
you &apos;re probably wondering why i called you all here .
nope .
well , stop your wondering ...
we &apos;re not wondering .
and behold .... this wonder !
oh , my god ! seriously ?
i sold a home to the one and only pete johnson .
there &apos;s only one pete johnson ?
only one who &apos;s california &apos;s top r.v. dealer .
there &apos;s 835 others . nightmare of a deal to paper .
well , and this was his way of saying ...
thank you .
of course .
he paid a commission , too , right ?
yes . and he told me i could take iolene out anytime .
yeah , i named her !
let &apos;s take this dirty girl for a spin up the coast !
yes !
awesome ! pretty sweet , huh ?
yeah !
i can see where this is going .
this summer--you , me , the kids ,
yellowstone national park .
and that &apos;s just the verona , he offered me an amalfi .
an amalfi , claire !
that makes the umbria look like a portofino !
well , they should &apos;ve called it the roman ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s what we &apos;re about to be doin &apos; .
i &apos;m really not following you .
ten days on the road with those kids ?
winnebag @-@ no .
著名房车生产商 &#93;
i hate it when phil does this .
now i have to be the bad guy
who comes in and squelches his brilliant idea .
i said no . get it out of my house .
fine .
come on , jolene .
fortunately , this time ,
i don &apos;t have to be the wet blanket ,
because even on just a short spin up the coast ,
phil will see what i see every day--
the transformation that happens
when our kids are locked in a moving metal box ...
the kraken that is unleashed .
i love my kids very , very much .
you &apos;re poking me .
yeah , well , i know , sweetie .
but i don &apos;t get these pins just right ,
your bun could fall out during your routine ,
and it could mess you up .
okay , let &apos;s test it out .
all right .
jump .
good . spin .
now give me beyonce .
okay , i &apos;ve done everything i can do .
it &apos;s up to you now .
we have a gymnast in our family .
yeah , lily goes to gymnastics class .
in one short year ,
i &apos;ve seen her blossom from a little girl
who couldn &apos;t do a somersault ...
into one who ... kind of can .
yeah , and by that standard , we also have a black belt ,
art prodigy , and prima ballerina in our family , so ...
you know , what we don &apos;t have in our family
is two loving , supportive fathers .
i &apos;m just saying , she &apos;s 5 , you know ?
and you never let her forget it .
excuse me , is that your little girl out there ?
it is .
and you did her hair ?
i did .
do you mind helping my julie with hers ?
oh , do you guys own a convertible ?
no .
oh , no judgment .
yeah , i &apos;ll get to work right when lily &apos;s done .
not bad . that little leap at the end--that &apos;s new .
she &apos;s getting really good .
you better bring your &quot; a &quot; game .
oh , my god . cam , look . lily &apos;s in second place . 9.2 .
i told you she &apos;s a gymnast .
with scores like that , she &apos;s gonna make pre @-@ team .
are you serious ?
pre @-@ team ? she could make pre-- what &apos;s pre @-@ team ?
claire !
phil !
haley !
luke !
alex !
gloria , we &apos;ve been through the roster three times .
they &apos;re not home .
but their cars are here . where could they be ?
who knows what these people do ?
but my backpack is in there , jay ,
my poem for my poetry reading .
calm down . didn &apos;t you back it up on your computer ?
what kind of man writes poetry on a computer ?
you could &apos;ve ended that sentence after &quot; poetry . &quot;
come in . and no questions .
my backpack wasn &apos;t upstairs .
what &apos;s that ?
postcard from a friend of claire &apos;s--rachel .
&quot; living it up in club med cozumel . &quot;
looks like that marriage went down the drain .
in other shocking news ,
phil subscribes to a trampoline magazine .
going through other people &apos;s mail--
keeping it classy , jay .
mom , my backpack isn &apos;t in luke &apos;s room .
i don &apos;t see it in here , either .
i don &apos;t think it would fit in there .
ay , this was open when i came in .
i was just looking for an aspirin .
i thought that i heard some noises .
so you were snooping ?
oh , so now it &apos;s snooping ,
wanting to know more about your family
by looking through their personal things ?
not just now . since the invention of things .
is that one of claire &apos;s brownies ?
no , they &apos;re delicious . must be cam &apos;s .
oh , no .
don &apos;t worry . there &apos;s more .
no ! that &apos;s where my backpack is .
cam drove me and luke home .
i must &apos;ve left it in his car .
why are you so scattered lately ?
aw , he &apos;s just nervous because of his poetry reading tonight .
but don &apos;t worry , papi .
i am going to be there to support you .
i don &apos;t want my mom there .
i &apos;m exploring some darker themes
i &apos;m not sure she &apos;s ready for ,
poems like &quot; the umbilical noose , &quot;
&quot; a jail called mom , &quot;
&quot; smother nature . &quot;
she &apos;ll just find some way to make it all about her .
and a toasty 75 degrees for daughter haley .
you see ,
the verona boasts individualized climate zones , claire .
i could literally transport a polar bear and an orchid
and not make two trips .
dad , i &apos;m freezing . it &apos;s , like , 1 degree back here .
six minutes in , and it begins .
here . take the blanket from the bed .
thanks , kitten .
dad , can you change the music ?
can i ?
oh , no . oh , no , that &apos;s just getting louder .
this isn &apos;t good . it &apos;s not good at all .
actually , it &apos;s kind of perfect .
right ?
the big windows , the classical music .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re in a movie .
turn it up , handsome .
you got it !
obviously , the novelty of the situation was delaying the inevitable .
but i didn &apos;t want to get halfway into a trip to yellowstone
before phil discovered
what malevolent hellspawn we have for children ...
whom i love very much .
alex , honey , that &apos;s a cute sweater .
doesn &apos;t haley have one like that ?
oh , it actually is hers .
i took it from her closet before we left .
really ?
ooh . sorry , girls . didn &apos;t mean to start a whole thing .
i am so sick of you always looking better in my clothes .
when did that happen ?
you &apos;re okay with this ?
oh , yeah . she can wear whatever she wants
after i &apos;ve had it for six months .
or i get it automatically if you buy anything that looks like it .
this just feels right . huh , team ?
matter of fact , i was thinking
we could all drive up to yellowstone this summer .
but i say ,
let &apos;s take this beeyotch ocean to ocean !
that &apos;d be cool !
awesome !
we &apos;re doing it !
phil , the road !
i don &apos;t know what button i just pressed ,
but that was amazing .
my backpack &apos;s definitely not in there .
well , they &apos;re not picking up their phone .
he must &apos;ve brought it inside .
sorry , kid , looks like you &apos;re out of luck .
come !
don &apos;t they have a burglar alarm ?
ay , please .
okay , everybody , split up and search .
jay , you look in the bedroom .
i &apos;m not looking in their bedroom .
fine .
mom , i don &apos;t think my backpack is in cam &apos;s bag .
i was just closing it for him .
i ... heard a noise .
looks like the guys threw a little party .
i noticed .
they brought out the guest soaps .
how long have you been in here ?
hey . this is that bottle of wine
i bought phil when he started his company .
and claire &apos;s lipstick is on many of these wineglasses .
pictionary . they had game night ?
but we always go to game night .
son of a bitch . they snubbed us .
found it !
there must &apos;ve been a dozen players .
pepper was here .
but pepper loves me .
okay , she &apos;s all set .
i defy you to find a tighter bun in this gymnasium .
lot of different ways you could &apos;ve said that .
oh , and good luck on your floor routine , sweetie .
not that you need it .
that &apos;s abby .
she &apos;s the best in class .
oh . she &apos;s our competition .
i &apos;ve never wanted to beat a kid so badly .
are you not hearing these ?
no ? okay .
oh , lily &apos;s on the beam .
i &apos;m nervous about her dismount .
you said that she could stick the landing , right ?
yeah , as long as she breathes , relies on her training ,
and stays in the zone .
we are talking about her stepping off a 6 @-@ inch beam .
and not falling . right .
i have to admit .
seeing lily do so well brought out something in me .
the pride of being a parent of a child
who wasn &apos;t just participating but thriving .
okay , here comes her dismount .
stick it lily . stick it !
she stuck it !
she stuck it !
9.4 .
if no one beat my daughter &apos;s score on the beam ,
she would make pre @-@ team .
she &apos;d be one of the elite .
funny thing , pride .
they say it goeth before the ...
fall . fall .
fall .
mitchell , i can hear you ...
what ?
rooting for a little girl to fall .
if i can hear you , other people can hear you .
yes !
i don &apos;t know why i said that . i don &apos;t--i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , he didn &apos;t mean it .
i didn &apos;t mean it .
no , um , he just got caught up .
and , uh , you know , we all know
competition makes people do crazy things.so ...
look at this ! her bun fell apart during the floor exercise .
her hair got in her eyes and she couldn &apos;t even finish !
you did it on purpose !
no !
daddies !
i &apos;m in first place .
yay . that &apos;s great .
did you offend them ?
me ? they love me .
can we go now ? i have a poetry reading tonight .
and speaking of that ,
are you sure you guys really want--
it makes no sense .
we &apos;re always the life of every party .
maybe they didn &apos;t invite you
because you &apos;re a couple of snoops ?
okay , mr. goody two @-@ shoes .
a trait normal parents would value .
jay , i think you &apos;re right about him .
he &apos;s been too good lately for a teenager .
it &apos;s not normal .
i am afraid that the world is going to--
oh , hell , no . this is too far . ay .
look at this .
is that supposed to be ...
that &apos;s us .
not only do we get blown off ,
now they &apos;re making fun of us .
well , i &apos;m just gonna leave them a little message .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
they can all ...
horse mouth ! that &apos;s a good one !
no , &quot; horse mouth &quot; is not an expression .
you can &apos;t get this ?
look . donkey .
that &apos;s not a donkey .
look at the ears .
okay . donkey mouth !
that &apos;s a terrible guess .
that &apos;s a terrible drawing !
we weren &apos;t invited because you stink at this game .
at least i can draw !
excuse me . just need a signature .
yeah , sure .
okay .
here we go .
there . thank you .
yep .
that &apos;s not a signature . you drew a cat .
thank you .
perfect freaking harmony .
that &apos;s when it hit me .
maybe it &apos;s not the cold confines of a moving vehicle
that brings out the worst in my kids .
maybe i bring out the worst in them
when there &apos;s no fun @-@ lovin &apos; phil around
to neutralize my toxins .
i was in a full shame spiral .
aah ! a bee !
and then something wonderful happened .
i got it !
you idiot !
kill it !
no , don &apos;t !
haven &apos;t you heard of colony collapse ?
bees are endangered !
okay , guys , stand still .
they can &apos;t see you if you &apos;re not moving .
it &apos;s coming near me !
do i look like a bee ? !
no , that was an accident !
well , so is this !
everyone remain calm !
i &apos;ll just open up the double @-@ tilt swiss skylight
and the airflow will pull
the bee out of--
aah ! there &apos;s another bee now !
we must be near its cave !
oh , my god ! there &apos;s so much stupid in here !
all right , i &apos;m pulling this thing over .
those are the wipers .
claire , say something !
kids , stop , please .
hey , there are daily flights to yellowstone .
aah ! you ripped my sweater !
my sweater , which you shouldn &apos;t even be wearing !
get off of my sweater !
short layover in salt lake .
are you really not gonna do anything ?
oh , phil , you must have known this was gonna happen .
i know that tone . you &apos;re making a point .
it &apos;s better that you find out who they are now
than when you &apos;re halfway across the country .
well , i guess i &apos;m just a naive boob
who thought we liked each other !
obviously , it was too much to ask
to think that we could take one magnificent trip
in a tricked @-@ out , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art r.v.
to see the sun dancing off the pacific .
what a huge ask !
i can &apos;t stand the way everyone &apos;s starting at us .
yeah , i know . it &apos;s the way we look at people
who walk with their pet birds .
there she is !
hey , good luck on your balance beam routine , sweetie .
you &apos;re gonna do great .
i &apos;ll never beat lily .
of course you will , because you &apos;re a superstar !
and your daughter &apos;s a genius . i am such a fan . such a fan .
okay , now you &apos;re overcompensating .
i have to !
you saw what a monster i was out there .
this--this is the exact thing i always hated in my dad ,
that ugly macho testosterone drive to win ,
and today it has flowered in me .
well ... no , this ends today , cam .
i am not passing this on to lily .
well , it &apos;s not all on you . you know ,
i &apos;m beginning to think maybe i did sabotage abby &apos;s hair .
i didn &apos;t spray . i didn &apos;t beyonce .
i basically built a ticking time bun .
well ...
are you okay ?
no .
my hair hurts .
i &apos;ll fix it .
we should find lily .
did you see what your daughter just did ?
uh ... lily , did you pull the pins out of julie &apos;s hair ?
yeah , she fell .
oh . okay , um ...
i--could i get everyone &apos;s attention for just a moment ?
we consider what our daughter just did
to be an embarrassment to the sport of gymnastics .
i assure you , she did not learn this from us .
and as far as we are concerned , that is a sign of weakness ...
not the way a winner behaves , but the way ...
a loser behaves .
a loser behaves .
come on , lily . let &apos;s get your grips and tiger paws .
you &apos;re going to a time @-@ out .
yeah . a nice long one .
i made pre @-@ team ,
and my daddies get to watch from outside .
no closer than 100 feet .
but we &apos;re appealing .
yay , lily !
kill the chicken ! chicken fingers !
pigeon man !
pigeon man ? pigeon man .
you see , tony , it &apos;s not me .
would you invite her to game night ?
i &apos;m gonna go now .
they &apos;re kinda sticklers about the next @-@ day delivery thing .
bird in the hand !
there you go .
any slower , she &apos;d be the u.s. mail ,
am i right ?
that &apos;s gonna kill at the warehouse .
you see ? you are the problem .
except you cheated . i saw you look at the paper .
i knew it .
you &apos;re no better .
all the screaming and bullying .
the question isn &apos;t why you two weren &apos;t invited .
it &apos;s why you &apos;re ever invited .
and by the way , this isn &apos;t even about you .
treasure ... chest .
now can we clean this place up and go ?
funny story .
my mom and jay were invited .
cam gave me the invitation at school ,
and i forgot about it .
but how could i tell them right after i &apos;d shamed them ?
i had to cover my tracks .
it &apos;s true , jay . i cheated .
i cheat a little bit every time that we come to the game night .
i think mitch saw me the last time ,
and that &apos;s why they don &apos;t want to play with us anymore .
but why would you do that ?
i don &apos;t know !
maybe because i don &apos;t want you to think that i am not smart .
i would never think that .
and besides , it &apos;s my fault , anyway .
the kid is right . i &apos;m too competitive .
lost a game of yahtzee once .
the dice are still on the wall .
yeah , but at least you &apos;re not a cheater .
i feel like such a donkey mouth .
guys , there &apos;s something you should know .
it &apos;s trivial pursuit night at mom &apos;s church .
i hate for you to miss my poetry reading ,
but maybe you could head down there ,
work on your sportsmanship ,
and you will feel better about yourselves .
are you sure you &apos;re going to be okay without me there ?
yes , mother . mother . i &apos;ll be in the car .
i get this damn competitive streak from my old man .
it &apos;s a miracle i didn &apos;t pass it down to mitchell .
i love that we can blame our parents .
my mother was the biggest cheater i &apos;ve ever known .
and she used to snoop on everything that we did .
ay . jay , look at this .
our invitation .
they must have forgot to give it to us .
no . i checked this bag when we got here ,
and it wasn &apos;t there .
why are you always--
&apos;cause you know i have a problem .
this was manny .
he forgot to give it to us ,
and then he came and tried to sneak it in there .
why wouldn &apos;t he just tell us ?
maybe because he doesn &apos;t want us to go to the reading .
that &apos;s why he was talking about the church and the game .
he was working us .
guess he &apos;s not too much of a goody two @-@ shoes .
no . he &apos;s a lying , scheming little sneak .
that &apos;s my son .
our son .
i &apos;ve never seen dad freak out like that before .
i feel terrible .
oh , it &apos;s partly my fault .
i goaded you guys into a fight to prove a point .
why do i always have to win ?
how did i get this way ?
that you ?
yeah .
you ?
yep .
how many kids in yours ?
felt like 30 .
i got four .
but i &apos;m thinking of emancipating two of them early .
tell me one of you has cigarettes or a flask .
sorry , buddy .
i &apos;ve been through every state--
depressed , catatonic , arkansas .
i considered faking my own death in bryce canyon national park .
have you been ? not to be missed .
i &apos;m gonna miss it . i &apos;m missing every bit of it .
i &apos;m not spending another second in that rolling asylum .
poor guy . how long you been on the road ? couple weeks ?
couple days ?
dad &apos;s in the middle of a super sad dude hug .
we really disappointed him .
yeah , maybe we should just suck it up
and go to jellystone this summer .
wait . that &apos;s why dad got this thing ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t go on a trip this summer .
why ?
i &apos;ve ...
i &apos;ve got stuff .
huh ? no . what stuff ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
luke .
summer school . i &apos;m failing pre @-@ algebra .
why didn &apos;t you say something ?
i don &apos;t know .
i feel stupid .
you know what it &apos;s like to follow her ?
all the teachers look at me
and think that i &apos;m some kind of irrational remainder .
did i use that right ?
no .
dang it .
but why didn &apos;t you ask me ? i would &apos;ve tutored you .
i tried , but you were always off in your room
or some corner of the house on the phone .
yeah , who have you been talking to so much lately ?
aaron ?
who &apos;s aaron ?
actually , it &apos;s two boys-- aaron and alex .
oh , two boys .
a boy named alex likes you ?
yeah , i know . it &apos;s weird .
but my friend andi with an &quot; i &quot; -- she &apos;s a girl--
also liked alex .
the boy ?
yes , the boy . i don &apos;t refer to myself in the third person .
i thought aaron was the third person .
no .
anyway , i thought i was cool juggling two boys at once ,
but ...
they both ended up dumping me on the same day .
sweetie , that &apos;s awful .
how did i not know this was happening ?
you &apos;ve been really busy lately ,
like with flipping that house .
and plus i didn &apos;t really want to talk about it ,
because it &apos;s kind of embarrassing .
not as embarrassing as failing a class that starts with &quot; pre . &quot;
baby ...
you guys wanna feel better ?
i auditioned to be a laker girl this morning .
what ? you did ?
no way .
i took all those dance classes when i was younger ,
and , i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve been trying to figure out
what i want to do with my life ,
so i saw online that there were open tryouts ,
so i went down there .
and ?
i &apos;m the new head laker girl , mom .
it was a disaster . i was the worst one there .
i couldn &apos;t even get through my routine .
you have a routine ?
pat , heath , you guys have given me the courage to go back in there ,
stand up to my wife ,
and tell her she was right all along .
happy trails , phil .
heath ?
i might just stay here a while .
phil . phil , i have to show you something .
don &apos;t gloat . i get it .
i keep trying to push this family closer together ,
but they need their space .
no , no , no .
we have too much space .
being in trapped in one room has forced us
to actually talk to one another ,
and i have found out some incredible things about our kids .
wait . incredible good ?
you tell me .
oh , my god .
dream come true ! i don &apos;t even need context !
what is this ? !
so our trip &apos;s back on ?
we &apos;re in if jolene &apos;s in .
come on . do it !
yeah !
why can &apos;t i get this ?
you just gotta focus . clear your mind .
loosen up . get in the zone . you know this .
okay , we &apos;re gonna walk through this together ,
step by step .
five , six , seven , eight ...
one , two , three , four ,
five and six , seven and eight ...
56.1 plus or minus 8.25 .
that &apos;s the first one .
one , two , three , four ,
five , six , two , five--
okay , number 2-- x plus 2 over 4
equals 3 plus 3--
minus-- damn it ,
alex , do you mind ?
we &apos;re doing something important here .
okay .
once more . from the tippy , like nobody &apos;s watching .
five , six , seven , eight . one two ...
