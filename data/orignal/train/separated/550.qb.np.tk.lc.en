and then in the season finale ,
they reveal the whole thing was a dream ,
when the inspector wakes up
next to a very young and very topless cheryl tiegs .
even pierce loves this show now ?
it &apos;s not inspector spacetime .
it &apos;s the american version , and it &apos;s a travesty .
it &apos;s broad , obvious , sexist , and the timing is ...
honey , i &apos;m dean !
what the hell is wrong with you ?
oh , jeffrey , you are too much .
why , i was doing some house cleaning the other day ...
&quot; deana reed &quot; style ... when i realized ,
&quot; gosh , golly , it &apos;s been ages since we had a dance . &quot;
so , this friday we are going back to greendale &apos;s golden age
with an old @-@ fashioned sock hop !
the health department requires you wear shoes .
what a &quot; coincidean . &quot;
you &apos;re throwing a dance the same day
the cdc is confiscating our drinking fountains .
placating students with a fun event .
classic bread and circuses .
in ancient rome , the emperor would distract the populace
from their problems by allocating money
for free bread and circuses .
i &apos;ve been making a conscious effort to get away from
filtering everything through tv .
i figured it &apos;s time i showed some growth .
it &apos;s been three and a half seasons ...
is what the old me would have said .
anyhoo , it is a sadie hawkins dance ,
which means girls ask the boys .
oh , i love those !
so , ladies , get out there and make yourselves useful .
so you &apos;re saying there &apos;s one day a year
when women are free to choose their own mates .
what is this , cave @-@ person times ?
well , i have already started on a sadie hawkins banner ,
so this thing is pretty much set in stone .
well , then maybe i &apos;ll throw my own dance ,
one that doesn &apos;t conform to your oppressive gender norms .
give me a break .
you think a dance can just be thrown together willy @-@ nilly ?
you think i decide to just do a rain forest theme
and buy palm fronds
and rig the sprinkler system to ...
hold on , i gotta write this down .
so , britta , you &apos;re gonna go a protest dance .
is that a thing ?
it is now .
and instead of sadie hawkins ,
my dance will honor a real feminist icon ,
someone who worked for women &apos;s rights every day of the year ...
sophie b. hawkins .
it wasn &apos;t really ...
you know what , britta , you &apos;re right .
a sophie b. hawkins dance
is just what this school needs ...
thanks , jeff .
to celebrate sophie b. hawkins and all her accomplishments .
jeez , winger , who &apos;s throwing this dance , me or you ?
um , britta , i think you meant to say susan b. anthony ,
not sophie b. hawkins .
britta for the whoops !
didn &apos;t you have a cat named susan b. anthony ?
how did you manage to &quot; britta &quot; that ?
i didn &apos;t &quot; britta &quot; anything .
i meant sophie b. hawkins .
really ? your plan was to throw a dance
honoring the singer of damn i wish i was your lover ?
and as i lay me down ,
which in my opinion is the far superior song .
ooh , that is a good song .
yeah .
yes .
i am throwing a sophie b. hawkins dance .
and it is gonna be amazing ,
and when people come they &apos;re gonna be like ,
&quot; damn ! she straight &apos; britta &apos;d &apos; this ! &quot;
because , that &apos;s right , i &apos;m taking it back !
you &apos;re really doing this ?
look , as someone who faked being a lawyer for seven years
i appreciate your commitment to the bit ,
but just admit you were wrong .
so you can say i &quot; britta &apos;d &quot; it ?
yes , of course . that goes without saying .
but come on , it was a small mistake .
call this off before it becomes a full @-@ scale &quot; brit @-@ astrophe . &quot;
i coined that . - jeff ,
if you don &apos;t want to come to my dance
you are free to go to the sadie hawkins dance ,
which will be happening at the same time across the cafeteria .
our school has limited venue options .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
oh , and one last thing ... you do realize
that if you call it a sophie b. hawkins dance
people will expect sophie b. hawkins
to actually be there , right ?
yes .
and when she comes i &apos;m gonna be like ,
&quot; i will remember you doubting me . &quot;
that &apos;s a sarah mclachlan song .
so , abed , i was thinking about what you said ,
about showing growth , and i was thinking
maybe one way to do that is
to meet new people and ...
where &apos;s this going ?
can i set you up with a date
for the sadie hawkins day dance ?
a blind date .
i &apos;ve always thought of myself as more of an acquired taste ...
but ... okay .
ooh , if you &apos;re open to meeting someone ,
there &apos;s a number of eligible young ladies
in my church .
shirley !
i &apos;m already finding a date for abed .
i asked first .
there &apos;s no reason we can &apos;t
both help abed find someone .
why don &apos;t we each pick a girl
and then let abed decide ,
instead of making it a competition .
that &apos;s exactly a competition .
so it is .
only for the loser .
i need the computer .
pierce , there are , like , dozens of computers .
yeah , but my email is on this one .
pierce !
jeez , what &apos;s up your butt ?
i may have lied this morning about meeting sophie b. hawkins
because i didn &apos;t want jeff to make fun of me ,
and then i may have lied to cover that lie ,
and now i &apos;m in deep ... lies .
so what ? so you told a lie , big deal .
the important thing is never to admit it .
actually , i was thinking about coming clean .
and give winger the satisfaction ?
hell , no .
besides , anything could happen between now and that dance .
an asteroid could hit .
do you want to be the schmuck who apologizes
just before the world ends ?
that kind of makes sense . thank you .
damn right it makes sense .
you &apos;re talking to the wisest man on campus .
now seriously , i need to get to my email .
the post office is about to close .
pierce !
guys , check out my friend britta &apos;s
sophie b. hawkins dance .
i &apos;ll be spinning the hits from yesterday and today ,
which are basically the same to me since i have changnesia .
that guy &apos;s like teflon .
no matter how much awful stuff he does ,
he keep getting another chance .
yeah , he &apos;s like the colin farrell of people .
you want to help me with britta &apos;s dance ?
could be a chance for classic troy and abed hijinks .
in the interest of growth i &apos;m trying to avoid hijinks ,
as well as capers , romps , and exploits .
escapades are a gray area .
abed . this is kat .
hi , kat . nice to meet you .
she wants to ask you something .
isn &apos;t she perfect for abed ?
she &apos;s like one of those quirky girls from the movies .
i saw her in the cafeteria trying to pay for lunch with a song .
i asked if you &apos;d go to the sadie hawkins dance
with me into the balloon .
could you hear it ?
sure , i &apos;d be happy to go with you .
super duper mister cooper !
nice .
so , you chose the girl i picked .
it &apos;s cool .
not like it was a competition or anything .
just be gentle when you tell shirley that she was the loser .
or do you want me to tell her ?
it &apos;s cool . i &apos;ll handle it .
so , was that girl an alien
or a toddler with a growing disease ?
hello , abed .
i talked to a lovely girl at my church
and she &apos;d be happy to go to the dance with you .
i appreciate it , shirley , but i ...
i hope you will at least consider it ,
and not just because saying &quot; no &quot; would crush this poor girl ,
but because i don &apos;t want you to miss out
on the opportunity of a lifetime .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;d love to go to britta &apos;s dance with her .
oh , goody ! i &apos;ll set it up .
oh , i hope this doesn &apos;t hurt annie &apos;s feelings .
maybe i should go tell her .
no need . i &apos;ll handle it .
oh , okay . bye @-@ bye .
at the risk of discovering i &apos;m living two parallel lives
like that guy in awake ,
don &apos;t you already have a date to the dance ?
yep . now i have two , which means
i can do the classic two dates in one night sitcom trope .
i &apos;ll get to wear two outfits . mix up their names .
maybe hide under a table .
what about growth ?
i tried to go in a more grounded direction ,
but i still ended up in a comically implausible situation .
it &apos;s like shirley said ,
it &apos;s a once in a lifetime opportunity for hijinks .
i can &apos;t pass it up .
it seems like you already passed up a great opportunity for hijinks .
i did ?
uh , duh doy ! britta &apos;s dance ?
you think two dates is crazy ?
planning a dance is hijinks city , population hijinks .
troy , i need your help .
get some ice ?
wac ... wacky ice . the ice will be wacky .
thank you for the corsage ..
oh , it matches your carnation . how cute .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
i was afraid you &apos;d think it was old @-@ fashioned .
i like old @-@ fashioned . i find it refreshing .
speaking of refreshing , i &apos;m gonna get us some punch .
be right back .
hi , i &apos;m kevin .
apparently i &apos;m your dj tonight .
i really don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing , so ...
if you have a request , please be specific .
i have changnesia .
can i help you ?
oh , i just wanted to try on a different look .
i &apos;m pretty indecisive ,
so i may be back here a few times , if that &apos;s okay .
mm @-@ hmm .
cool .
i &apos;m also gonna need to check this gideon &apos;s bible
and this jelly bean kaleidoscope .
icebreakers .
hey , britta . where &apos;s sophie b. ?
is she backstage drinking zima and counting her beanie babies ?
sorry , i can &apos;t divulge that .
stars and their privacy , you know .
but she &apos;ll definitely be here ?
oh , yeah . sophie be coming .
so it just be coincidence that somebody posted
a craigslist ad an hour ago
that says , &quot; looking for sophie b. hawkins ,
or convincing sophie b. hawkins impersonator
to play community college dance tonight .
very little money . &quot;
it &apos;s weird how in demand she is .
good thing we booked her early .
britta , we &apos;re running low on chips .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
i go over to the sadie hawkins dance
as the snack inspector , doing random spot checks ,
and confiscate their chips .
all i need is a disguise .
or you could just go to the supply closet and get some more chips .
okay , but i @-@ i still need to use the moustache probably .
here , in lieu of flowers
i got you this . it &apos;s quirky .
thanks , guv &apos;nor !
i &apos;ll just put it in me invisible sack .
okay , i &apos;m gonna get us some punch .
how are things going with you and jessica ?
are you two ... as they say on tv ... making a connection ?
unless that means sex , in which case i hope you are not .
things are great .
actually , jessica did mention that she &apos;s cold .
could she borrow your sweater ?
maybe the purple one you wore last week .
i didn &apos;t see you wear it home , so i think it &apos;s
still in your locker next to your umbrella .
i guess i could check .
could you ?
that &apos;d be great .
okay .
hey , roomie .
what do you think of kat ?
did she tell you she plays the saw ?
i thought she was in an all @-@ girl kazoo band ?
they need a rhythm section , duh .
well , keep me posted . i &apos;m gonna go say hi to britta .
no , don &apos;t !
because you have something in your teeth .
a lot of somethings .
i do ? what is it ?
ooh , i can &apos;t tell in this light .
but it &apos;s definitely there .
you should probably check it out in the bathroom .
maybe the second floor one ? better light .
i will . thank you .
you &apos;re a good friend .
hello , jeffrey .
are you enjoying the sock hop ?
a sock hop britta has all but &quot; britta &apos;d &quot;
by not &quot; britta @-@ ing &quot; her own dance .
well , the night is young .
by the way ,
i &apos;m surprised you let her share the cafeteria with you .
oh , i didn &apos;t want to . but once she guaranteed
the presence of a certain someone , i couldn &apos;t say no .
i wouldn &apos;t get your hopes up for sophie b ...
oh , it &apos;s me .
shall we dance ? whoop .
are you reading the bible ?
no spoilers .
i &apos;m really hoping that things turn around for this job guy .
so , how do i look ?
good . except you gotta lose the hat .
it doesn &apos;t go with the minister &apos;s daughter .
you know what i &apos;m doing .
yeah . you &apos;re on two dates at once .
i &apos;ve been watching you since you came in .
i &apos;m not good with faces . is that a judgmental face
or a happy face ?
i think it &apos;s awesome .
it &apos;s one of my favorite bits ,
like when a dog acts embarrassed ,
or when a guy chases after the girl
and then does that big public declaration of love .
it &apos;s not realistic . it &apos;s taking something private
and turning it into a performance .
well , i think the dog &apos;s trained .
no , i was talking about the public declaration of love ...
oh , you &apos;re messing with me .
yes , i was .
so this thing &apos;s turning out to be
a little tougher than i thought . you wanna help ?
i &apos;d like to , but i &apos;ve still got like
1,200 pages left of this bible . yes , of course i would .
cool . cool , cool , cool .
tonight &apos;s sadie hawkins dance
is brought to you by hawthorne wipes .
for the little lady who knows her place in the kitchen .
and tonight &apos;s sophie b. hawkins dance
is brought to you by hawthorne wipes .
perfect for cleaning the dashboard of your &apos; 92 subaru .
ah , quite a turnout , britta .
yep . didn &apos;t know sophie b. hawkins
was so big at greendale .
oh , yeah . a large percentage of greendale
students sort of gave up in the mid &apos; 90s ,
so for many of them sophie b. hawkins
is the most recent music they &apos;re aware of .
i mean , her coming here is gonna be a huge boost
to their spirits .
great .
whereas , her not showing up
would be enough to push these people
to such a dark place and really question
whether life is worth living at all .
okay , bye @-@ bye .
so , how long have you been doing bible studies ?
i mean , making miniature hats out of duct tape ?
oh , duct tape hat ... oh !
so you &apos;ve never seen any of the star wars movies ?
we were taught popular films were the work of the devil .
well , if you &apos;re talking about the phantom menace ,
you were taught right .
telegram .
ooh , yeah , it &apos;s urgent .
be right back .
pierce , sophie b. hawkins isn &apos;t coming .
everyone &apos;s gonna know i &apos;m a liar .
help me .
oh , britta .
let me tell you a story about a friend of mine
that everyone called a liar .
his name was bernie madoff .
pierce ! he was a liar .
he stole billions of dollars from his clients .
has this been confirmed ?
oh , my god . i &quot; britta &apos;d &quot; it .
bernie ?
oh , hi , shirley .
hello , annie .
abed seems to be having a good time , which is all that matters .
you &apos;re right .
looks like he made the right choice .
he certainly did .
so , we agree . the best woman won .
she certainly did .
he &apos;s on two dates , isn &apos;t he ?
he certainly is .
this is the most fun i &apos;ve ever had
on a work study gig .
and i used to run the frozen yogurt machine
before that old guy broke it .
there &apos;s been so many close calls .
i keep forgetting details , using the wrong names ,
having to duck behind plants .
this night has been perfect .
oh , what else is on the list ?
sorry .
if this were a movie , this would be the part where we kiss .
you &apos;re right .
except we &apos;re doing a sitcom trope ,
so it &apos;d be totally out of place .
time to go get caught and make an impassioned plea
to the girl i really like .
i think i &apos;m gonna go with jessica .
she seems to be the audience favorite .
okay , bye .
did you really think you &apos;d get away with this ?
let me explain .
what about wanting to grow ?
or was that just a lie so you could do
another world @-@ famous abed tv adventure ?
these are real people you &apos;re messing with .
kat is over there hula @-@ hooping all by herself .
abed , in the real world people can actually get hurt .
oh , this is great . so , i got a request for ,
&quot; you suck at this . get off the stage . &quot;
okay , i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s the band or the song .
again , apologies . changnesia .
well , it blew up in my face ,
in a slightly different way than i planned .
can i help you ?
where &apos;s rachel ?
she said she had to go .
where ?
i don &apos;t know . she seemed upset .
she ran out of here without tagging half this stuff .
i mean , whose water wings are these ?
come back here !
never mind .
i &apos;m sorry .
i did mean what i said about growth .
but then you were both so intent on getting me dates ,
i couldn &apos;t help myself .
it was wrong , and hurtful .
i see that now .
well , maybe setting you up was a bad idea .
yeah , i guess neither of our girls were really right for you .
the worst part is that i met a girl tonight
that i really do like .
but i was so busy chasing one trope ,
i missed the trope right under my nose ...
that the girl i liked all along was under my nose .
and now i &apos;ve screwed things up .
i don &apos;t know if i can make them right .
wait . this one &apos;s real , right ?
yeah , i &apos;m really sad .
well , go find her , dummy .
yeah , haven &apos;t you ever seen a movie ?
sophie ! sophie ! sophie !
sophie . sophie . sophie .
i hate to say i told you so ,
but i &apos;m gonna say it to britta &apos;s face .
sophie ! sophie ! sophie !
what is the nature of hope ?
sophie &apos;s not coming , guys .
boo ! boo !
looks like someone underestimated
the time it takes to plan a dance .
hey , hey , hey ! it &apos;s sophie b. hawkins !
good evening ! i &apos;m sophie b. hawkins .
i think you know this one .
oh , man .
* that old dog has chained you up alright *
* give you everything you need *
* to live inside a twisted cage *
* sleep beside an empty rage *
did you do this ?
if it &apos;s possible to make something happen
by willing it , then , yes , i did .
* damn , i wish i was your lover *
* i &apos;d rock you till the daylight comes *
* made sure you are smiling and warm *
* i am everything *
* tonight i &apos;ll be your mother *
* i &apos;ll do such things to ease your pain *
* free your mind and you won &apos;t feel ashamed *
pardon me , sophie .
i have something to say .
there was a girl here tonight . her name was rachel .
i met her , and it was very pleasant .
and i made a mistake .
and now i &apos;d very much like to continue
this conversation in private .
wow , viva lost love .
* damn , i wish i was your lover *
* i &apos;d rock you till the daylight comes *
you came back .
that was pretty embarrassing .
i had to ...
it was . but i &apos;m glad i did it .
so , would you like to go out sometime ?
i would like that .
do you want to pretend like you &apos;re
just going out with me on a bet ?
i &apos;d like that very much .
but maybe we should try normal first .
sure .
i prefer &apos; as i lay me down &apos; .
me too .
i can &apos;t believe she pulled this off .
i know .
according to dean law , i must now give her my amulet .
what ?
well , she had a little help from a wise old man
who was the official supplier of moist towelettes
to the lilith fair between 1997 and 1999 .
i knew it . you &apos;re safe .
you did this ? but why ?
because , in the face of all logic and reason ,
britta didn &apos;t back down .
that makes no sense .
also , i didn &apos;t like the way
you were being such a jerk to her .
well , she was acting crazy .
yeah , but what choice did she have ?
you make fun of her ,
you use her name as a synonym for screwing up .
cut her some slack , jeff .
she helped you reconcile with your dad .
for pete &apos;s sake , let her be happy .
* it felt like springtime *
* on this february morning *
* in the courtyard birds were singing your praise *
&quot; i know it &apos;s probably impossible to read my texts
&quot; without them sounding sarcastic ,
&quot; but i assure you ,
&quot; this one is as earnest as they come .
&quot; congratulations on an awesome dance .
&quot; you britta &apos;d the hell out of this thing . &quot;
* this i pray *
* that you will hold me , dear *
* as i lay me down to sleep *
* this i pray *
* that you will hold me , dear *
* though i &apos;m far away *
* i &apos;ll whisper your name *
* into the sky *
here &apos;s a sneak peak on next week &apos;s community .
