he went underwater !

i found a quarter at the bottom of the pool .

do you understand me ? i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
didn &apos;t you hear me calling you ?
you scared me half to death .
come here . let &apos;s go .
dillan , try to be more careful .
did you , uh , you stop for malasadas this morning ?
no .
what &apos;s it , evidence from a case or something ?
no .
you know what , just stop , stop .
what &apos;s in the bag ? just ... what &apos;s in the bag ?
it &apos;s my lunch , genius .
your lunch ? okay , what did you bring ?
you got to know every last minute detail of my life ?
what &apos;s it to you what my lunch is ?
because you don &apos;t want to tell me .
what , you think it &apos;s so fantastic i &apos;m gonna steal it ?
you fly in some deep @-@ fried sandwich from new jersey
i &apos;m not allowed to know about ?
it &apos;s a salad .
okay ?
it &apos;s a salad . that &apos;s it .
there &apos;s nothing else in here .
it &apos;s just a salad , okay ?
grace has been taking a nutrition class ,
and she &apos;s concerned about my cholesterol ,
so i promised her that i would eat better , okay ?
happy ?
huh .
that &apos;s actually incredibly sweet .
i appreciate that .
whole modern eating thing is just ridiculous to me .
when i was a kid , we ate whatever we wanted .
know what i mean ?
no more , buddy .
hold up .
who &apos;s that ?
i do not know .
can i help you ?
jenna kaye .
central intelligence agency .
special agent kaye , what can i do for you ?
i believe i have something that belongs to you .
i can &apos;t continue this investigation
into the police department from the inside .
i don &apos;t trust the people i work with .
that &apos;s my father &apos;s voice recorder .
how &apos;d you get that ?
how &apos;d you lose it ?
it was stolen by a local yakuza boss .
hiro noshimuri .
okay , you can stop asking me
questions you know the answers to .
i just have one more .
would you kindly gather all the case files
related to your investigation
and your father &apos;s private files ?
why ?
the agency has taken an interest in your investigation
of noshimuri and the yakuza .
that &apos;s all i can say .
that &apos;s all you can say ?
all right , well , i &apos;m gonna say something then .
the yakuza was targeting my father
and is responsible for my mother &apos;s murder .
i &apos;m sorry , but this matter
has been classified as above your pay grade .
why don &apos;t you un @-@ classify it
and i won &apos;t even ask for a raise .
would you like me to have the director call the governor
to compel you to hand over your files ?
are you threatening me ?
i just want to know if you &apos;re gonna
make this hard on yourself , or are we gonna get along ?
hey . uh , we got something . sorry to interrupt .
i &apos;ll be right there .
okay .
you &apos;ll have my files by the end of the day , okay ?
now give me my father &apos;s recorder .
you &apos;ll get it when i get the files .
why did you not just
give her your files right then and there ?
what is your play , please ?
must you know every detail of my life ?
hey , this is the cia you are dealing with here , okay ?
they wrote the book on advanced interrogation techniques ,
which i am absolutely positive
you have sitting on your bedside table right now , okay ?
just so you know , i understand , okay ?
i would not mind a little one @-@ on @-@ one session with jenna kaye .
the thought does stimulate my imagination , too .
legally , the cia can only interrogate foreign nationals .
why do you do that ?
i had a little fantasy worked out .
i mean , you &apos;re , like , a devourer of dreams .
you know what i mean , like , you eat them .
like a little pac @-@ man in cargo pants .
let me guess , this guy thought he could fly .
ah , a common misconception .
although captain fallout dons a cape ,
he &apos;s not capable of actual flight .
merely superhuman leaping abilities .
max ... who &apos;s captain fallout ?
the fearless leader of the wondrous seven .
he acquired his powers when he was attacked by one of hitler &apos;s
radioactive german shepherds during the battle of the bulge .
really ?
wow , you guys need to brush up on your classics .
no , no , no . we don &apos;t need to brush up on anything .
you need to bring us all back to reality , here on earth ,
and answer the obvious question .
why &apos;d this guy take a dive wearing tights ?
well , spectacucon is in town this weekend .
so i assume our victim was going to attend .
okay , it &apos;s a comic book convention .
do we have an id on the vic yet ?
afraid not .
but due to the nature of the injuries ,
i would estimate that he fell at least ten stories .
maybe he &apos;s a jumper , max .
no , this was definitely a homicide .
facial lacerations embedded with glass fragments indicates
our victim was most likely thrown out of a window .
perhaps a sliding glass door .
the residues on both wrists are consistent with duct tape .
he was bound ?
yes .
and the defensive bruising also suggests ...
that he struggled with his attacker . okay .
looks like he got a message from someone named psycho kitty .
&quot; be careful , he &apos;s looking for you . &quot;
too bad our vic didn &apos;t get this warning in time .
okay , keep us posted .
that was kono .
she got an id off the vic &apos;s cell .
so what is , uh , captain fallout &apos;s secret identity ?
his name is alex baker .
he &apos;s an insurance adjuster from atlanta .
he flew in two days ago for this convention .
chin and kono are checking out his hotel right now .
what &apos;s up , dawg ?
that &apos;s funny , right ?
that is funny .
psycho kitty &apos;s got to be here somewhere .
this may take a while .
more good news .
holy air @-@ conditioning .
it &apos;s a meat freezer in here .
tourists .
they come to hawaii for the sun ,
they spend all their time in freezing hotel rooms .
no signs of forced entry .
or a struggle .
trajectory lines up . it &apos;s a clear drop to the pool below .
but , you know , max said that alex baker had
facial lacerations from broken glass .
they &apos;re obviously not from these windows .
i don &apos;t think this is our crime scene .
well , our vic had to be thrown off the building
from some place .
it &apos;s broken glass .
it &apos;s got to be from the suite directly above .
room 1703 is registered to jonathan demille
from port allen , louisiana .
manager says it has the exact same layout
as room 1603 , alex baker &apos;s room ,
just directly one floor above .
look , there &apos;s a card still in the lock .
that &apos;s weird .
way weird .
try the one the hotel manager gave you .
this is our crime scene .
she goes by the name psycho kitty .
you sure you haven &apos;t seen her ?
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re supposed to be looking for psycho kitty .
did you see her ? i may have been
too judgmental of this place , because she &apos;s really cute ...
please , can you focus ?
sure .
uh , look at this . uh , captain kirk .
we &apos;d just like to ask you a couple questions .
commander sisko .
commander sisko ?
from ds9 .
you ever see any brothers on the enterprise ?
well , there &apos;s the one ...
uhura .
uhura .
she was a sister .
and she answered the phone .
i &apos;m a commander .
okay , we have that in common .
listen , my partner and i are looking for this person .
have you seen her ?
sure , that &apos;s psycho kitty . i &apos;d like to
beam her up to my quarters .
she hangs out with the plushies
at the furry fandom exhibit .
the plushies at the ... ?
do you know what psycho kitty &apos;s real name is ?
gail woodson ?
yes ?
alex and i met on an online message board .
we started talking on the phone .
and , um , you know , we liked the same stuff :
monty python , neil gaiman , keyboard cat videos .
got real serious real fast .
but you guys never actually met face @-@ to @-@ face ?
not until today .
and i was pretty nervous .
but then , once i saw him ,
i don &apos;t know , i can &apos;t explain it .
it was like ...
like i &apos;d known him my whole life .
but then ...
then what ?
then my ex @-@ husband trevor showed up .
i don &apos;t know , he must have hacked my e @-@ mail or something ,
because he knew we were going to meet up here .
he flipped out and he caused a big scene .
did he get violent ?
trevor said that i couldn &apos;t see alex anymore ,
and that if i did , he would find alex ,
and when he found him , he would kill him .
trevor wright , aka psycho kitty &apos;s ex .
jacksonville sheriff
just sent down his jacket .
this guy has a stupid , stupid amount of assault charges .
a temper , huh ?
he &apos;s violated probation
by being here at all .
which is two years mandatory .
detective danny williams .
all right , good . thank you .
put an apb out on trevor &apos;s rental car .
just found it parked at kailua beach .
trevor wright .
five @-@ o. hey !
five @-@ o ! hey !
don &apos;t make me run !
hey , buddy , need a lift ?
i guess that &apos;s a no .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of alex baker .
who the hell is alex baker ?
alex baker is the guy that you threatened
in front of your ex @-@ wife and a couple hundred other witnesses .
you didn &apos;t get his name before you threw him off the balcony ?
super dork ? he &apos;s dead ?
i &apos;m going to put this together for you , all right ?
this morning you threatened to kill alex .
two hours later he &apos;s dead .
you see the connection there ?
there &apos;s a connection . you got that ?
no way . look , i just wanted to scare him .
but after he ran away , gail unloaded on me .
made it clear we were never going to be together again .
so i was upset .
i left the convention , and came out here .
took one of those dolphin watching cruises .
shirt pocket-- check it .
dolphin excursions . 11 : 00 a.m.
there &apos;s at least a dozen people
that can put me on that boat today .
dolphins .
yeah , okay , got it .
that was mcgarrett . their suspect checks out .
alibi &apos;s rock solid .
what &apos;d you get ?
jonathan demille ,
the name this room is booked under ,
has been dead for nearly a year .
but a credit card was opened up
with his name and social a few months ago .
it &apos;s called ghosting .
that &apos;s when you take the identity of someone recently deceased
and then you rack up charges
until the credit card company wises up .
and here i am paying 18 and a half percent interest ?
well , here &apos;s a $ 30,000 watch .
maybe you can use this to pay off your debts .
ripe for the taking , which means this wasn &apos;t a robbery .
someone tossed this room looking for something specific .
right .
still doesn &apos;t explain how our vic ended up in this room .
i had the manager run the key card
we found in the lock this morning .
it was programmed for room 1603 .
okay , so then why would our friend alex baker
use his room key to try to get in here ?
okay , well , get this .
the hotel records show
he signed for drinks at a bar this morning .
so i had max run his blood alcohol .
it was three times the legal limit .
this guy was blasted .
so he leaves the convention and hits the bar
to drown his sorrows .
rides the elevator up , gets off at the wrong floor .
right , and in these hotels ,
all the corridors look exactly the same ,
and he &apos;s too wasted to notice his mistake .
meanwhile , someone &apos;s ransacking this room
and then they hear baker at the door
trying to get in with his key .
they pull him inside and they tie him up .
because as far as they know , he &apos;s their man .
kono , we need to find whoever booked this room .
they &apos;re our only lead to catching our killer .
where did you find this ?
it was recovered in the
course of an active homicide investigation .
homicide ?
i don &apos;t understand .
what does this have to do with us ?
a man was murdered this morning ,
and that watch was at the crime scene .
when i ran the serial number ,
it came back as registered to your husband .
mrs. davis , may i speak with him , please ?
well , richard &apos;s out of town on business .
he &apos;s expected back tonight .
wait , you don &apos;t think
he had something to do with this , do you ?
his watch was at the scene .
well , then richard couldn &apos;t have been involved .
this watch was stolen from our house three days ago .
did you file a police report ?
of course .
they gave me a copy . i &apos;ll go get it .
look , it &apos;s right here .
well , looking at what was taken it could have been a lot worse .
that &apos;s quite a collection .
do you think the person that robbed us killed somebody ?
at this point , we don &apos;t know .
but just consider yourselves lucky
you weren &apos;t home when they hit .
stephen mcgarrett ?
as requested .
enjoy the rest of your day .
you , what &apos;s your name ?
wo fat .
yeah ?
housekeeping .
no @-@ no , thank you . i &apos;m good .
there should ...
there should be a sign on the door ...
we need to talk .
how &apos;d you find me here ?
it &apos;s above your pay grade .
we need to talk .
i told you there &apos;s nothing i can share with you .
i &apos;m going to do something for you
that your agency has a problem with , okay ,
and that &apos;s be honest with you for just a second .
you got two options the way i see it right now .
the first one is that i walk out of here .
the second one is that you tell me what &apos;s really going on ,
because that &apos;s the only way you get to know what i know .
you understand ?
okay , fine .
i really wish you would have knocked .
i did , twice .
what , are you moving in here ?
nobody unpacks in a hotel .
habits of a clean freak .
really ?
how long you been tracking the yakuza ?
longer than you .
and you read the state department
report outlining how they launder their money ?
i &apos;m listed in the footnotes as a source .
so you &apos;re a subject matter expert ?
that &apos;s why they brought you in ?
i know as much as the next gal .
you know what ?
we got off on the wrong foot .
and i think it &apos;s my fault .
i shouldn &apos;t have been kicking your door in . i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , of course i &apos;m going to cooperate
with the agency in any way i can .
in fact , you know what i &apos;m going to do ?
i &apos;m going to call director hadley right now
and i &apos;m going to officially offer my services to your task force ,
because that &apos;s the kind of freedom the five @-@ o has .
stop . stop it .
hang on .
stop !
you obviously already know i &apos;m not on official assignment .
you &apos;re not even a field agent .
you &apos;re a low @-@ level analyst , and that suit you wore this morning
playing grown @-@ up with me in my office ,
probably cost you two weeks &apos; salary .
i bet ... i bet you &apos;ve ever even left your desk before .
you need to leave .
i think you &apos;ve gone rogue to hunt down a man named wo fat .
a couple of months ago i met him on the 18th hole .
he was playing a round of golf
with the men that killed my mother .
and if he &apos;s working with them ,
you need to tell me right now .
there &apos;s something i need to show you .
not here .
i id &apos;d our missing thief , jonathan demille ,
and pulled a statement from his credit card .
all right , well , at the very least ,
he &apos;s stimulating the local economy .
we got $ 1,000 at a skate shop .
another few hundred at a video game store .
the last couple of weeks he spent almost 20 grand
at a strip club . a place called femme nu .
you cannot spend that kind of money
without attracting some attention .
someone over there has got to be able to point us towards this guy .
and maybe he can point us towards our killer .
let &apos;s go .
how you guys doing ?
what can i get you ?
we &apos;re actually looking for a customer of yours .
his name is jonathan demille .
oh , you mean johnny d.
yeah , sure i know him .
but , you know , you guys aren &apos;t the only ones looking for him .
why ? what do you mean ?
well , there &apos;s this big guy in a tracksuit ,
buzzed hair , goatee .
you could just tell he was bad news .
well , that guy just dropped an innocent man
off a balcony , thinking he was johnny d.
i didn &apos;t @-@ i didn &apos;t tell him where he could find johnny d.
couldn &apos;t have if i &apos;d wanted to .
you don &apos;t find johnny d , johnny d finds you .
that &apos;s very spooky .
uh , when is the last time that johnny d found you ?
tuesday , when his girl tiffani &apos;s working .
tiffani ? is she here now ?
no , she &apos;s off today .
all right , so the girl &apos;s name is tiffani martin .
i just pulled her phone records .
all right , these are text messages .
yeah , i &apos;m going to run a key word search for johnny &apos;s name .
and ... here we go .
it looks like they &apos;ve been
going back and forth for a few weeks .
okay , see if you can find his real name
or an address off the account .
yeah .
damn . no . it &apos;s a pre @-@ paid cell . it &apos;s untraceable .
you don &apos;t find johnny , he finds you .
you gonna quote this schmuck now ?
i can spoof tiffani &apos;s cell
and make it look like she &apos;s sending him a text .
lure him here . i like it .
but move over , please , because i &apos;m going to do this
because it should be very filthy ,
and you &apos;re a young lady .
okay , well , it &apos;s all set up so whatever you send
is going to look like it &apos;s from tiffani &apos;s cell .
got it .
&quot; hey , stud . &quot;
that &apos;s not your lead in , is it ?
what do you want ?
i &apos;m trying to sound like a stripper .
try harder .
okay .
&quot; if you are available ... &quot;
what ?
that &apos;s so bad . get out of here .
oh , go ahead .
i &apos;m embarrassed for you now .
go ahead , go ahead .
really i am .
and send .
that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s effective , i guess .
it worked . wow !
girl &apos;s got game .
damn .
wo fat was one of the good guys .
he started his career
as an intelligence agent for the chinese mss .
quickly became one of their best .
i got the highlights from your investigation file .
he worked counterintelligence at the 6th bureau .
he reached the rank of colonel
and then he suddenly disappeared , right ?
disappeared for years .
whatever he was doing , he must have realized
that government work doesn &apos;t pay too well ,
because when he resurfaced , he was already
a major player in the criminal underworld .
i &apos;m sorry , what did you just do ?
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
that . what was that ? what happened ?
oh , you mean my gum ?
yeah , with your gum .
this is a computer , it &apos;s not your high school desk .
thank you .
uh , how many bodies have you put on wo fat ?
23 that we know of .
cia &apos;s been tracking his movements for nearly a decade ,
but every time we think we &apos;re close , he vanishes .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s playing with us .
then a few months ago , i tracked him to hawaii .
he paid a visit to someone you know .
victor hesse .
the man who killed my father .
wait a minute .
i didn &apos;t know victor hesse worked with wo fat .
he doesn &apos;t work with wo fat .
works for wo fat .
same with the yakuza .
none of them makes a move without his approval .
are you trying to tell me
that wo fat ordered my father &apos;s murder ?
i believe so .
no , no .
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
victor hesse killed my father
because i wouldn &apos;t release his brother .
victor hesse arrived in hawaii before
you captured his brother .
how could he have anticipated that ?
i believe that wo fat sent him here to do a job .
to murder my father .
i &apos;m sorry .
okay , you know what else doesn &apos;t make sense to me ?
why would you break away from the agency
to hunt wo fat alone , huh ?
why not work through the channels ?
you got the cia behind you .
what &apos;s going on ?
three years ago , i was working the central asia desk at langley
when i uncovered a series of illegal arms
deals being brokered out of china .
my team ended up tracing them back to wo fat ,
somebody who wasn &apos;t even on the agency &apos;s radar yet .
i was the first one to put a name to the face .
but i got too wrapped up in the hunt .
i tracked him to an arms deal in macau .
an agency grab team
was dispatched based on my intel .
but it was a setup .
they walked right into a trap .
there were no survivors .
my fiance was on that team .
and , uh , as standard protocol ,
the agency removed you from the case .
conflict of interest .
but you can &apos;t let it go .
after three years of dead ends ,
i finally picked up a solid lead ,
discovered that wo fat was here in hawaii .
so , i took leave from the cia to track him down .
let me ask you a question .
what are you gonna do when you find him ?
same thing you would do .
wait here .
this was stolen from my father &apos;s toolbox by hiro &apos;s men .
it &apos;s part of the evidence in a case my father was working on
right before he was killed .
a week ago , this package was left on my doorstep .
these postcards were inside .
somebody &apos;s obviously trying to send you a message .
maybe there &apos;s something on the postcards that you overlooked .
yeah .
steve , it &apos;s danny . we got a lead on johnny d.
meet us at femme nu .
all right , i &apos;m on my way .
okay , you &apos;ve become acquainted with my office already .
feel free to use it for as long as you need .
you &apos;re an analyst .
analyze these .
you sure about this ?
i plan to find wo fat .
and if he &apos;s as elusive as you &apos;re saying that he is ,
i &apos;m gonna need all the help i can get .
you and i , we &apos;ll meet tomorrow .
onofun noodle house , it &apos;s on lewers , 8 : 00 p.m.
i &apos;ll be there .
be there .
oh , and , kaye .
yeah ?
we &apos;re gonna get along just fine .
all right , hold up .
this might be him .
here &apos;s johnny .
whoa , whoa . geez .
did he really just do that ?
oh , put him out of his misery .
all right .
there &apos;s a problem , officer ?
johnny d.
you &apos;ve been racking up bar tabs ,
keeping the strippers of honolulu
in self @-@ tanner and tattoos .
what can i say ? i like to give back to the community .
you like to take from the community , too .
come on , the people
that i steal from are insured .
this guy is such a jerk .
aside from obvious intellectual impairments ,
you have managed to rip a lot of people off .
but there is something very tragic here .
you know what it is ?
that i won &apos;t be seeing tiffani for a very long time ?
no . incorrect .
it &apos;s that an innocent man is dead because of you .
what are you talking about ?
that &apos;s alex baker .
he was booked in at the lonopuha .
somebody thought he was you , threw him off a balcony .
that &apos;s horrible .
does he have a family ?
he had a woman who loved him .
look , i got word that some guy was asking around about me .
i spotted the dude the next day .
big guy in a tracksuit ?
buzzed hair , has lines shaved into his eyebrows .
outweighs me by a hundred pounds .
i took off before he could jump me .
that &apos;s why i was laying low at the hotel .
okay , who is this guy ? you know him ?
somebody you ripped off , what ?
i doubt it .
people i hit have money .
money buys classes .
this guy was a thug .
money also buys hired muscle .
question is :
what &apos;d you steal that &apos;s worth killing for ?
voila .
why don &apos;t you make this easy on us and just direct us towards
the stuff that is from your last boost ?
mavis !
can you bring me the reports from last week &apos;s robberies ?
sorry , my secretary must have stepped out .
smart @-@ ass ,
do you pack the garage from back to front ?
yes , like a dishwasher .
okay , good . then we start here , we work our way in ,
see if we can find what the killer was looking for ,
maybe we find him .
all right ,
get out of the way , please .
officer , if he moves , shoot him .
anything ?
yeah , i got some antique silverware .
i got about 100k in jewelry here .
but i got nothing an insurance claim wouldn &apos;t cover .
what about you ?
got it !
we &apos;re all good .
season four , cheers .
funny show .
hey , danny .
check this out .
you ...
why would you steal this ?
i always wanted to go to paris .
you know what , it &apos;s a beautiful city .
and if you ever make it ,
you should get yourself a snow globe , because this is seattle .
it &apos;s the space needle ,
not the eiffel tower , you schmuck .
what is this ?
memory card for a digital camera ?
i know ... it was in the snow globe .
where &apos;d you steal the snow globe ?
look , at the risk of incriminating myself any further ,
i &apos;ve hit so many places , it &apos;s impossible to say .
you think that that &apos;s what the guy &apos;s looking for ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out , right ?
do me a favor , take him to the station .
all right . let &apos;s go .
the memory card you found is password protected .
looks like 64 @-@ bit encryption .
okay , can you crack it ?
yeah , give me a couple minutes .
check this out .
looks like johnny d &apos;s stalker .
i had a sketch artist work up
a composite based on his description .
hpd showed it around the hotel .
three employees reported seeing him there right around
the time that baker went over the balcony .
all right , so that &apos;s our killer .
yeah , but i haven &apos;t been able
to match the face to the name though .
all right , i got it .
looks like one file on the card .
and it &apos;s a video .
okay , it &apos;s time stamped .
july 2008 .
wait a minute .
go closer on her .
i &apos;ve seen her before .
that &apos;s lindsey roberts .
she &apos;s a local girl from aiea .
she disappeared in the summer of 2008 .
but there were no signs of foul play ,
so the case went cold until ...
they found her body at mokuleia national forest reserve .
this was ten weeks after they reported her missing .
killer was never found .
okay , if this video was made
right before lindsey &apos;s disappearance ,
then the mystery man on the video could be her killer .
that &apos;s why alex baker was thrown off the balcony .
that &apos;s why johnny d &apos;s room was searched .
this guy is trying to get back
the evidence that could link him to lindsey &apos;s murder .
lindsey had this way about her .
she just made everyone around her ...
happier .
listen , i @-@ i can &apos;t imagine
what you guys have been through ,
and i know even now
it must be really difficult to talk about ,
but we do have to ask you a question .
at the time of her disappearance ,
was lindsey involved in a relationship with anyone ?
lindsey was in her first year at uh law .
i mean , between school and her internship ...
there wasn &apos;t any time for boyfriends .
are you positive ?
look , we said all of this to the police
when they took our statements the first time .
why are you asking about this now ?
there &apos;s something that we need to show you .
these photographs popped up in an unrelated investigation .
but we know this was recorded
four days before lindsey was reported missing .
either of you guys recognize this guy ?
oh , my god .
that &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s davis . that &apos;s richard davis .
he was lindsey &apos;s boss .
cod was blunforce trauma to the back of the head .
the left parietal bone in lindsey &apos;s skull fractured ,
causing intracranial hemorrhaging .
were you able to determine the murder weapon ?
no .
no ? but ...
during the autopsy , we recovered a wood fiber ,
embedded in the skull .
the chief medical examiner dismissed it as inconsequential .
he explained that
the body was found in the forest , so it stood to reason
that the wood could enter the wound .
but you disagreed .
i was an assistant m.e. at that time ,
only two months into the job .
it wasn &apos;t my place to challenge my superior .
dr. gold made the ruling , and ...
i respected it .
but ... the question always nagged at me .
you kept it .
it took me six months
to save up enough money for the testing .
spectroscopic analysis identified the wood as
northern white ash , approximately 60 years old .
that does not sound native to hawaii .
correct .
it can be found in the northeast .
in fact , this particular genus was grown exclusively
by a new york lumber supplier that provided wood
for a variety of commercial products in the &apos; 40s and &apos; 50s .
rifle stocks , golf clubs , and , uh , picture frames .
but ... the top account at that time was schuster &amp; mills .
an athletic company whose top seller was ...
wait a minute .
are you saying we &apos;re looking for a baseball bat from the &apos; 50s ?
possibly , yes .
come on .
you &apos;re a genius , max .
thank you .
what is this ?
search warrant .
richard davis .
what &apos;s going on ?
hands behind your back , please .
mr. davis , you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law .
you have the right to speak to an attorney .
if you cannot afford an attorney ...
this bat must &apos;ve cost a fortune .
it was made to kill pitchers , not pretty young women .
what are you talking about ?
lindsey roberts died from a blow to the head
with a blunt object .
there was a wood fragment embedded in her skull ,
and i &apos;m better the tests are going to prove
that that fragment came from this bat .
this is absurd .
lindsey roberts was an intern in my firm
for maybe a couple months before she disappeared .
now what happened to her is @-@ is tragic .
but i had nothing to do with it .
so you weren &apos;t having an affair with her ?
no .
this is you and lindsey .
how do you explain this ?
why don &apos;t you explain this ? !
i didn &apos;t kill her .
are you really still trying to deny this ?
i swear , i didn &apos;t kill her .
i couldn &apos;t have .
i loved her .
we were in a relationship .
yeah , i @-@ i admit it .
but ... but the bat is in my trophy case .
it &apos;s ... the photo ... where did you get that photo ?
they &apos;re stills , from the little home video you made .
let me ask you something .
did lindsey even know that you were recording her ?
no , no . i @-@ i didn &apos;t ...
that &apos;s me , yes , that &apos;s my office ,
but i never made a video .
i wouldn &apos;t do that to her .
something you guys gotta see .
one week
after lindsey disappears ,
five calls from davis &apos; direct line at work
to her cell phone .
why would he be calling her if he knew she was dead ?
exactly . so we did a little more digging .
davis &apos; wife anne used to be a public school teacher ,
which means she had to undergo a background check .
so i ran her fingerprints
against the ones we lifted off the sd card .
it &apos;s a match .
did a little digging in anne davis &apos; financials .
she writes a check to her personal trainer
for $ 500 every single month .
a couple days ago , he gets a bonus check .
$ 10,000 , right ?
so we did background on this guy . go ahead .
paulo bell . 37 . he &apos;s got a record .
aggravated robbery , multiple weapons charges , battery .
that &apos;s a familiar face .
that &apos;s because ... he matches the sketch
that you had mocked up of our suspect ,
based on johnny d &apos;s description .
we just found anne &apos;s hired muscle .
five @-@ o ! hey !
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of alex baker .
when did you learn of your husband &apos;s affair with lindsey ?
i &apos;m not answering any more of your questions
until my attorney &apos;s here .
excuse me .
mrs. davis has decided to
exercise her right to remain silent .
unfortunately for mrs. davis ,
we just picked up her friend mr. bell ,
and he was in a ... a much chattier mood .
it &apos;s his word , but he said that you gave him $ 10,000
to , uh , retrieve some stolen property .
in particular ,
a snow globe that you said had great sentimental value .
you know ? the guy wasn &apos;t even aware that , uh ,
it had evidence of a murder on it ?
so for all intents and purposes ,
alex baker , an innocent man ,
was thrown off of a balcony
for a snow globe .
anne , what really happened ?
when i first suspected richard was having an affair , i ...
i needed to know the truth .
so i set up a hidden camera in his office .
did you confront your husband with the proof ?
no , i never told him i knew .
that night i e @-@ mailed lindsey from his computer .
asked her to come over .
i just wanted to talk .
but then she admitted that she was in love with him .
and that he was going to leave me so they could be together .
i don &apos;t know what happened , i ...
i just saw the bat , and i ...
i didn &apos;t mean to kill her , i ...
i didn &apos;t mean to kill her .
book &apos; er , danno .
on behalf of lindsey , and our entire family ,
we &apos;d just like to thank the five @-@ o task force
and the honolulu police department .
because of their hard work , we can now move forward
knowing that justice will be served .
what makes you think i won &apos;t kill you
right here in this restaurant ?
the man who strikes first
admits that his ideas have given out .
old chinese proverb .
say hello to my little friend .
old american proverb .
do you honestly believe i &apos;d come here without
some assurance of my safety ?
where &apos;s agent kaye ?
heading east , on kapiolani boulevard .
driving a silver malibu .
but who can really say ?
in any case ,
i am sure she &apos;ll make it here without incident .
what do you want ?
to know the man who is trying to know me .
well , what i know
is that hiro and hesse both answer to you ,
which means , at the very least ,
you &apos;re an accomplice to my parents &apos; murder .
and at the most , you &apos;re directly responsible .
interesting theory .
if that theory pans out ,
i promise you ...
i will find you ,
and next time it will be on my terms .
a little friendly advice .
i wouldn &apos;t dig too deeply into your family &apos;s past .
you might not like what you find .
