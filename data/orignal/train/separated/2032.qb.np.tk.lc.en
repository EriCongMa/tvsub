walter ...
i can &apos;t guarantee you we &apos;ll win ,
but i can guarantee you that i will never sell you out .
you told me that mike ross wasn &apos;t a threat ,
and then he handcuffed us with a t.r.o.
i want proof that he &apos;s giving up his bid ,
and if i don &apos;t get it by the morning ,
i &apos;m gonna call my private investigators ,
and i &apos;m gonna finish what i started .
what did harvey tell you ?
looks like he told me the truth .
we &apos;re done .
i want you to stop the personal attacks on mike .
you told me this wasn &apos;t gonna be a problem .
you don &apos;t have to stop this
because you &apos;re some changed man .
you have to stop this , because you owe me .
mr. ross , eric woodall .
i &apos;m the u.s. attorney--
for the southern district of new york .
yeah , i know who you are .
since when does the s.e.c. go around intimidating law firms
by going after their clients ?
they don &apos;t , but they will
when eric woodall starts there next week .
seven clients , seven subpoenas ,
all coming tomorrow .
uh , excuse me , you don &apos;t have an appointment .
i don &apos;t need an appointment .
sit down , shut up , and listen .
harvey might forgive you because you returned those recordings ,
but i don &apos;t .
donna .
not done .
what harvey did with gillis , it was harsh ,
but using what i told you in a private conversation--
that crosses a line that even harvey never would .
donna .
still not done .
when you left our firm , you left me too ,
but i honestly thought that we &apos;d always be friends .
now i &apos;m not so sure .
amy , did you send donna the package ?
guilt gift . didn &apos;t open it .
it was a balenciaga classic town bag .
ivory ?
anthracite with an outside pocket .
his idea or yours ?
don &apos;t answer that .
it was yours .
i &apos;m sorry , donna .
you and harvey want to knock each other out ,
you go right ahead .
but don &apos;t ever betray me again .
nice shoes .
she &apos;s even better than i imagined .
looking for this ?
harvey specter .
what brings you to montclair at 7 : 00 in the morning ?
oh , you know what brings me here .
i woke up to find these on my welcome mat .
well , as much as i &apos;d love to have been responsible
for subpoenaing seven of your firm &apos;s top clients ,
i didn &apos;t even know about this till just now .
you didn &apos;t even have the balls to come at me directly .
get off my property .
what &apos;s the matter , eric ?
you &apos;re afraid i &apos;ll get you fired again ?
i get it .
you want to hear me say i &apos;m using my new position
to destroy your business ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re the piece of garbage that got me fired .
isn &apos;t that what you want to hear me say ?
oh , i know you &apos;ll never say that ,
but i do want you to admit that
you sent an agent brian harris after my firm .
sorry . i don &apos;t even have jurisdiction over that department .
that department &apos;s run by a man name sean cahill .
so all on his own ,
sean cahill just happened to target my firm ?
well , he is a killer attorney
with a nose for sleazy lawyers ,
and i should know .
we came up together at the justice department .
you know , that little governmental agency
that protects their own ?
well , eric , your big brother couldn &apos;t protect you
from getting fired before ,
and i don &apos;t see how this is gonna be any different ,
and by the way , that &apos;s yesterday &apos;s paper .
you wanted to see me ?
sure did . have a seat .
i was going over our trade sheets .
couldn &apos;t help but notice
you bought another 100,000 shares of gillis industries .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
do i look like an asshole to you ?
where the hell did you get the money ?
you know where i got the money .
i bought those shares on margin .
and leveraged my company .
the bylaws said i can do it .
i don &apos;t care what the bylaws say ,
you did this without asking .
look , i know you &apos;re pissed .
oh , i &apos;m not pissed .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you to have the balls
to do something like this since you got here .
you raised my risk ,
but you also raised my reward , and on top of it ,
you did it like an investment banker ,
without permission .
well , thank you , jon .
go get &apos; em .
one more thing .
yeah ?
you have a week to de @-@ leverage my company .
if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re out of a job .
you want to explain to me why
you went to eric woodall &apos;s house this morning ?
i understand you &apos;re bent out of shape
because i stepped on your territory--
you think i give a shit about my territory ?
what the hell are you doing in here ?
listen , i really don &apos;t care if you work this thing or i do ,
but whoever it is has to not be an idiot .
and how , exactly , am i an idiot ?
you poked the bear .
eric woodall isn &apos;t the bear .
no . i am .
and whatever you were about to say , don &apos;t say it .
harvey , this is his case .
it &apos;s why we brought him in ,
and i don &apos;t want you involved .
me ?
i &apos;m the one who found out it &apos;s not woodall coming after us , it &apos;s--
sean cahill .
you think i didn &apos;t know that ?
these are my clients , and when they call in a panic ,
i need to be the voice on the other end of the line .
then be the voice on the other end of the line ,
but you &apos;re not handling the s.e.c.
i &apos;m the reason they &apos;re coming after us .
which is why you wanted to hire jeff in the first place .
that was before all this became real .
now that it &apos;s happening ,
he doesn &apos;t want to sit on the sidelines .
damn right i don &apos;t .
well , then find yourself a comfortable spot on the bench ,
because like it or not , jeff &apos;s in charge .
so it go just like you said it would ?
exactly , except for the part
where if i don &apos;t find a new investor in a week ,
i &apos;m out of a job .
i &apos;m surprised he gave you a week .
amy , it &apos;s not funny .
i know it isn &apos;t .
i was just trying to make the best of the situation .
well , if you want to make the best of the situation ,
get me a meeting with tony gianopolous ,
because if i can &apos;t get in there ...
i &apos;m in trouble .
we &apos;re in trouble .
you really mean that ?
you think i &apos;m staying here if you leave ?
thank you , amy .
i &apos;m just kidding .
epstein &apos;s been trying to poach me
since the day i got here .
yeah , you think those flowers bought themselves ?
you--
can i talk to you a second ?
if you want an update on the takeover ,
you should talk to harvey .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
look , logan , i @-@ i know that you--
i have five companies here
that i &apos;m looking at for my next deal ,
and i need someone to evaluate them
from a legal standpoint .
your next deal .
yeah , my next deal .
harvey told me not to hurt my future
by going below the belt with mike ,
so instead of not hurting my future ,
i thought i &apos;d start planning for it .
so then maybe harvey is who you should be planning it with .
well , harvey &apos;s got stuff to do ,
and he &apos;s not the one who convinced me to back off mike .
are you saying that i owe you ?
no , i &apos;m not saying that ,
but that is what you said to me .
so we &apos;re just gonna go back and forth , trading favors ?
rachel , this isn &apos;t a favor .
i have a board meeting on friday .
i need to be prepared .
so are you my lawyer or not ?
i will get right on it .
thank you .
louis , i need your help . we &apos;re gonna need to--
don &apos;t speak .
you may speak .
what were you doing ?
just thanking the lord god almighty .
we taking down jessica ? we firing malone ?
i am tingling .
what , harvey ? just tell me what .
mike ross just bought another 2 % of gillis industries .
he must be leveraged up to his scrawny little neck .
exactly , and he &apos;s gonna be scrambling for funding .
you want me to get your t.r.o. removed .
how do you know that ?
because you pissed off judge ramos
and now she can &apos;t stand you .
how do you know that ?
oh , because i keep a list of your enemies .
you want to see it ?
just get it done .
oh , i &apos;m gonna get it done .
it &apos;s like taking candy from a baby .
louis , we &apos;re splitting mike &apos;s focus .
that doesn &apos;t mean he won &apos;t be prepared .
oh , he can prepare all he wants ,
but the student is about to meet the master ,
because ralph macchio doesn &apos;t stand a chance
against mr. miyagi .
you know the karate kid ?
that &apos;s not cool , harvey .
oh , let me see if i can guess why you &apos;re here .
you came to tell me the way i handled jarvey
this morning was sexy .
oh , you mean when i told him to leave you alone ?
and the way that i allowed you to do that was very sexy .
and this is ...
the griffen cosmetics subpoena .
i looked them all over .
this is the weakest one .
the weakest one ?
exactly .
once this one goes down , the others fall like dominos .
first of all , if i were gonna take that strategy ,
i would go for the hardest one .
second of all , why don &apos;t you walk yourself
back to your office and let me do my job ?
excuse me ?
you told harvey you brought me in to handle this .
your job isn &apos;t to worry about what i told harvey .
your job is to worry about what i &apos;m telling you .
and what i &apos;m telling you
is that i &apos;m not walking into an s.e.c. negotiation
with a babysitter .
negotiation ?
this is going to be a war .
i know that , and i &apos;m gonna win it with one shot .
then i suggest you warm up to this .
you &apos;re not walking into the s.e.c. with a babysitter .
you &apos;re walking in there with a bazooka .
hey , mike , you need to see something .
no , i don &apos;t have time .
i &apos;m working on the gianopolous proposal .
yeah , that proposal isn &apos;t gonna matter if they win this .
goddamn it .
harvey &apos;s trying to roll back the t.r.o. ?
no , it &apos;s not harvey . check the docket .
it &apos;s some woman named lois litt .
yeah .
i know how to handle her .
um , here . this is 90 % done .
check it over . make sure there &apos;s not one comma out of place .
mike , come on , you know i can do more than--
i don &apos;t have time , amy . just do it .
okay .
how long did you work in this shit hole ?
sorry i &apos;m late . been up to my neck in work .
just filed seven huge subpoenas .
yeah , we know what you filed .
oh .
i see you brought the missus .
jessica , whatever you &apos;re about to say , don &apos;t say it .
how about i say it with this ?
ooh , a subpoena ?
smells fresh .
it is .
and you &apos;ll be answering it in court tomorrow .
oh , well then i better see what flavor bullshit
you &apos;re serving up .
to exchange ...
ah , ah , now , this is a good one .
&quot; malicious prosecution of pearson specter clients , &quot;
and how exactly are we doing that ?
i &apos;ll tell you how .
you come at our clients .
our clients leave us .
you drop their cases .
well , i certainly wouldn &apos;t tell them
that &apos;s how to avoid s.e.c. scrutiny ,
but it &apos;s not my fault
if dropping pearson specter starts catching on .
enough bullshit .
you &apos;re targeting my clients
on behalf of eric woodall , and you know it .
that is a lovely theory , but if you had any proof ,
you wouldn &apos;t be standing here right now .
i have proof , sean .
i have proof you filed seven cases
in one day against our clients ,
which we both know has never happened
in the history of the s.e.c.
it has now .
we &apos;ve filed nine cases against clients of weil gotshal ,
eight against skaaden ,
and six against cravath .
welcome to the new s.e.c.
we target law firms .
and as long as we &apos;re not only targeting yours ,
the only way to shut this down is to shut us down .
you and i both know
what &apos;s really going on here , sean ,
and i &apos;m gonna prove it .
well , good luck , but how do you think
judge hopkins is gonna respond to your allegations
when i tell him they &apos;re coming from a man
who is about to be fired ?
oh , you-- you didn &apos;t tell her .
ooh , that &apos;s awkward .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
jessica !
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
well , you need to hear it .
what ?
that you lied to me ?
you know , i didn &apos;t actually lie to you .
oh , no , no , no . you tell me that you didn &apos;t lie
because we never directly asked you the question ,
and i will knock your head off .
all right , fine .
i lied .
i lied because it doesn &apos;t matter .
i want to fight for you , and i &apos;m the best man to do it .
well , the new part of the equation
is that you just made me look like a fool .
jess .
don &apos;t pull that jess shit with me--
i want to know what it says in your file .
i don &apos;t know what it says .
how the hell do you not know ?
&apos;cause whatever it is is bullshit .
because the reason they were gonna fire me
is that i refused to go after you .
then why didn &apos;t you tell me that
when you came at us demanding a job ?
because good lawyers negotiate
from a position of strength , not weakness .
well , the position you just put us in
is pretty goddamn weak .
aw . is it the boy wonder .
louis , hey .
don &apos;t louis me .
you left without even the courtesy of a &quot; how &apos;s your father ? &quot;
what does that mean ?
it means that i &apos;m not here to exchange pleasantries .
i &apos;m here to get that t.r.o. lifted .
well , i &apos;m sorry you feel that way .
i &apos;m also sorry to hear about sheila .
bullshit you &apos;re sorry to hear about she--
what are you talking about ?
come on , you have to have heard .
heard what ?
she &apos;s engaged .
it &apos;s all over harvard &apos;s facebook page .
oh , my god , how could she do this ?
she said she could never be attracted to a handsome man .
yeah , and that picture doesn &apos;t even do him justice ,
but this one , however ...
a thong ?
yeah .
that ... - what the--
yeah , it &apos;s a whole , like , beach thing , i guess .
long weekend .
you &apos;re a son of a bitch , mike .
you &apos;re not even sorry at all .
you &apos;re using this to get into my head .
louis , come on , i can &apos;t believe you .
you think i would use sheila &apos;s engagement
just to get you off your game ?
never gonna work .
that i would stick it in your face
that she &apos;s all up in this guy &apos;s business
in a way that you &apos;ve never seen before ?
water off a duck &apos;s back .
that right now she &apos;s probably scrapbooking
the first day of their relationship ,
which apparently happened just weeks
after you broke her heart ?
you &apos;re the devil .
next up on the docket ,
sidwell investment group versus sanders international .
looks like that &apos;s us , i &apos;ll see you in there .
louis , i can &apos;t believe it .
i give you one goddamn job to do ,
and you-- what are you doing up there ?
harvey , please , i can explain .
explain why you stood in front of the judge like a moron ?
what possible explanation--
sheila got engaged .
what ?
when ?
this morning .
louis , i &apos;m sorry .
i was so sure that she would just come around
about having children , you know ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been turning down
all those j @-@ date requests .
we &apos;ll get mike another way .
oh , you &apos;re goddamn right we &apos;re gonna get him .
i &apos;m gonna get that son of a bitch
if it &apos;s the last thing i do .
what are you talking about ?
he used the sheila news to get into my head , harvey .
used the news or gave you the news ?
oh , please , what difference does it make ?
what difference does it make ?
it makes all the difference .
like on the one hand , i feel for you ,
and on the other , you &apos;re the world &apos;s biggest idiot .
look at my computer .
i &apos;ve been staring at it for three hours .
it &apos;s real .
i don &apos;t believe it .
yeah , that adonis on that yacht ,
sheila &apos;s fiance .
that adonis
is a photoshopped picture of lorenzo lamas from 1998 !
who the hell is lorenzo lamas ?
well , i can tell you who he isn &apos;t .
he isn &apos;t sheila &apos;s fiance !
oh , thank god .
are you even listening ?
it was bad enough that nigel rattled you
with your unread cat letters .
now you &apos;re letting mike do this ?
harvey , please .
shut the hell up !
look , i tried to warn you ,
and you stood there with your stupid leg up in the air ,
telling me that the student was no match for the master
and all it took was one doctored picture
for you to shit the bed !
i didn &apos;t mean to--
shut the hell up !
god .
well , fancy meeting you here .
rachel , get out of here .
i was just coming to make some copy--
louis , what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it ; nothing is wrong .
well , obviously something &apos;s wrong .
you know what , if you &apos;re so curious ,
why don &apos;t you just go ask the man of your dreams ?
i &apos;m sure the two of you will have a big laugh about it later .
okay , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ,
but seeing you like this ,
there &apos;s no way that i would laugh at you .
what is it ?
mike convinced me that sheila was engaged
to throw me off my game .
i &apos;m so sorry , louis .
yeah , well , he sure wasn &apos;t .
stuck a knife in me , twisted it
with the thought of her and another man .
it felt like a drill in my skull all day ,
and then to top it all off ,
it cost me the respect of my best friend .
maybe--
oh , don &apos;t you even try to defend him .
no , i wasn &apos;t going to .
i was going to say ,
maybe this is what you needed
to decide to reconnect with sheila .
and what about harvey ?
how do i repair that ?
i &apos;m really sorry for what happened , louis .
i am .
did you eat ?
are you asking because you &apos;re concerned about me
or because you want to know if i left you any food ?
tough day ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve just been working 16 @-@ hour days ,
and i &apos;m really--
stressed .
yeah i know the feeling
really ?
&apos;cause i heard that you had a pretty big win today .
you talked to harvey .
i talked to louis .
mike , i know you want to win ,
but do you have any idea what your lie did to him ?
it wasn &apos;t a lie .
it was a strategy .
it was both , and it ended up with him near tears .
come on , rachel .
it just seems like all that matters to you is winning
and that you don &apos;t care about
what it does to your friends .
you know what ?
i &apos;m sorry that i hurt louis ,
but he was going to that courtroom
so they could put their tender offer to a vote .
i know .
you also know because we &apos;ve had this discussion before
that if he got his way ,
they would rip that company to shreds .
so instead of coming down on me for what i did to louis ,
why don &apos;t you start worrying about all the lives
that logan sanders is gonna destroy if that happens ?
you know , it &apos;s funny .
you told me you didn &apos;t care who was in charge .
you just wanted whoever it was to not be an idiot .
are you saying that i was an idiot ?
i &apos;m saying we both were .
i shouldn &apos;t have gone to woodall ,
and you shouldn &apos;t have lied to us .
you don &apos;t seem pissed .
i &apos;ve had enough happen already today .
besides , lying to me was wrong ,
but lying to the woman you &apos;re in a relationship with
is a whole other level .
when do you think she &apos;s gonna get past it ?
from personal experience , that could take a while .
that &apos;s not my problem .
that &apos;s yours .
then what are you doing here , harvey ?
i &apos;m here to tell you what you &apos;re gonna do about it .
no .
no way .
i &apos;m not taking the stand .
then what are you doing here ?
because woodall telling you to go after our clients
is how you got this job in the first place
and happens to make our case .
he didn &apos;t outright tell me to do it ,
and you know it .
you had to find out somehow .
i found out from brian harris .
he told me he had this funny feeling
that the day after woodall arrived ,
that i was gonna start issuing subpoenas
to pearson specter clients .
when i asked him why , he said , &quot; you know why . &quot;
then you &apos;re gonna get up on the stand
and tell them that .
i can &apos;t . i have no proof .
it was vague , and it &apos;s a third party conversation .
which makes it hearsay , and i don &apos;t give a shit .
well , i do , &apos; cause it opens me up to slander at best
and perjury charges at worst .
well , jeff , you used that story
to get your ass in here .
now use it to get the job done .
amy !
i thought i asked you to leave the gianopolous proposal on my desk .
and i did , 20 minutes ago .
what ? okay .
did you proof it ?
no .
i thought you &apos;d have a better chance
if the document was riddled with typos .
this is important .
i know it is ,
which is why i read it backwards and forwards .
okay , did you add the part
about the leveraged recap like i asked ?
i did ,
but your figures on the non @-@ voting stock didn &apos;t add up ,
so i proposed a staggered board
to make up for the imbalance .
staggered board ?
yeah , don &apos;t act so surprised .
i &apos;m sorry , i just thought that you--
you just thought that i didn &apos;t know anything
about what goes on here ?
listen up , t. boone pickens ,
i actually know a lot about this business .
okay , i said i &apos;m sorry--
and i know more than enough to know
that that looks like every other proposal
that &apos;s comes across my desk .
well , that gives me a shit load of confidence going into this meeting .
i &apos;m not trying to destroy your confidence .
that &apos;s the one thing you have going for you .
then what are you trying to do ?
mike , you &apos;re not here
because you crunched sidwell some numbers .
you &apos;re here because you solved a problem for him .
all right .
get rid of this , and bring--
and bring you everything i can find on tony gianopolous .
on it .
amy .
why aren &apos;t you--
why am i an assistant
and not an investment banker ?
i &apos;m getting my phd in psychology .
money bores me .
i don &apos;t know why you needed to talk to me in chambers ,
mr. malone .
i was clear on my ruling .
well , with all due respect , your honor ,
your ruling didn &apos;t cover the fact that
the s.e.c. has a vendetta against pearson specter .
that &apos;s a serious accusation .
and if it were the truth ,
he would have said it out there , not in here .
i &apos;m doing it in private , sean ,
because i don &apos;t want to slander an entire department
based on the actions of two men .
translation ?
he doesn &apos;t want to be charged with perjury
because he &apos;s lying , and this is a joke .
it wasn &apos;t a joke when i was asked to do the exact same thing
that he &apos;s doing right now .
what the hell are you talking about ?
before i left the s.e.c. ,
i was told to target pearson specter clients .
and who exactly told you ?
brian harris .
then go after him ,
&apos;cause all you &apos;ve got on me is hearsay ,
and might i point out
this is the accusation of a man who is about to be fired ,
which i &apos;d say should be taken with a cubic meter of salt .
well , that cubic meter of salt might actually get a little bit smaller
if sean here were to , say , open up his files
and show us his paper trail .
our work product is covered under federal regulation ,
and he knows that .
i also know you &apos;re hiding behind your office
and using his court to do it .
all right , all right , that &apos;s enough .
mr. malone , i don &apos;t appreciate you
using my chambers to testify ,
and he may not have proof ,
but if one client leaves his firm
and their charges miraculously disappear ,
you &apos;re looking at more than sanctions .
you &apos;re looking at jail time .
thank you .
rachel ?
it &apos;s only been a day .
you already have a suggestion for my new deal ?
i do .
good .
then which of those five companies should i go after ?
none of them .
so you brought me nothing ?
no , i brought you five better options .
what &apos;s wrong with the op--
just take a look .
these companies have no disposable assets .
no , they don &apos;t . they have underperforming assets
that can be turned around and built into something .
did you even look into the companies i gave you ?
yes , i did , but i--
but what ?
sounds like someone &apos;s been drinking
her boyfriend &apos;s kool @-@ aid .
maybe if more people did ,
there just might be--
god damn it , rachel ,
i &apos;m not in business to save the world .
i asked for a professional opinion .
and i gave you a professional opinion .
you just don &apos;t like it .
no , i don &apos;t .
and now we &apos;re gonna have to work all day tomorrow
to do what i asked you to do in the first place .
you mean spend all day together .
if that &apos;s what it takes .
did you call this board meeting
just so we could spend more time together ?
did you bring me deals you knew i &apos;d reject
just to avoid it ?
look , like i said ,
i have a meeting on friday ,
and i need to be prepared for it ,
so maybe you should go back to your office ,
get cracking ,
and just give me a call when you have something .
okay .
you &apos;re kidding me .
so this is all mine ?
yup .
in 20 days , the public access will be gone ,
and you will have yourself 1 / 4 mile of private beach .
what about the southampton city council ?
what about them ?
they &apos;re a bunch of public @-@ access loving assholes .
like i said , what about them ?
how &apos;d you do this , mike ?
well , the question isn &apos;t how i did it ,
it &apos;s why i did it .
oh . you want something from me .
just your consideration .
well , you &apos;ve earned it . go ahead .
not interested .
you didn &apos;t even look at it .
oh , i don &apos;t have to .
you just said that i earned your consideration .
mm @-@ hmm , and you just got it .
gillis industries is ripe for a turnaround ,
and i already own 7 % .
congratulations .
now go beg someone else for money ,
because you &apos;re not getting mine .
i don &apos;t understand .
you don &apos;t have to .
now get the hell out of my office .
mr. gianopolous .
i said get the hell out .
hey , mike . how &apos;s it going ?
fancy meeting you here .
it was you .
what was me ?
i &apos;m just here to thank you for the advice you once gave me .
you know , back when we were friends .
louis .
no , no , no . no , no , no .
you once told me that my actions had consequences .
remember ?
your actions yesterday have consequences too .
what did you say to gianopolous ?
not much .
just that you were the person responsible
for his number two leaving him .
i was responsible ?
he agreed to it .
but what he didn &apos;t know was is that
it was his own lawyer who came up with the idea .
now he does .
and what does that--
have to do with it ?
he may have agreed to it ,
but it was a betrayal by you .
and here &apos;s a little something
you obviously do not know about investment banking .
the only thing more satisfying to these guys than money
is sticking it to someone who stuck it to them .
louis .
i &apos;m sorry for hurting you with sheila .
don &apos;t you ever mention her name to me again .
okay , but it was a move ,
like you just did .
so can we move on ?
move on ?
you used the woman i love
to extend your goddamn t.r.o.
you knew how i felt about her ,
and you did it anyway .
i will never , ever forget it until the day i die .
good luck beating harvey without money .
i have good news .
james dolan died and left me the knicks ?
louis stopped mike from getting gianopolous .
he blocked his funding .
good .
you went to louis with a problem ,
he fixed it ,
and all you &apos;re gonna say is &quot; good &quot; ?
donna , i &apos;m glad he fixed the problem ,
but it was a problem he created .
he created it because
when it comes to people he cares about ,
louis has a blind spot .
yeah , for people and cats
and who knows what else ?
i &apos;ll tell you what else .
he cares about you .
what do you want from me , donna ?
i want you to tell him he did a good job .
i &apos;ll tell him when we come out on top .
okay , harvey .
you do what you &apos;re gonna do ,
but just remember , when louis asked sheila to marry him ,
you were the one he picked to be his best man ,
and you said yes .
i &apos;m sorry , but we &apos;re not hiring today .
i think you &apos;d be looking for a job
given the beat @-@ down you took in chambers .
i &apos;m not sure what jeff disgruntled employee here told you ,
but i &apos;m still standing .
well , what i told her is that you lost .
then why are you here ?
we &apos;re here to make you an offer .
you drop all seven cases ,
we drop the malicious prosecution claim .
no deal .
judge hopkins is going to be waiting for you to take action .
too much time goes by ,
he &apos;s gonna think you &apos;re full of shit .
but if you fold right now ,
he &apos;s only gonna sanction you for the exact claim
that we &apos;re willing to drop .
which is why we &apos;ll tell the judge
that in exchange for those cases being dropped ,
we &apos;ll give the s.e.c. unprecedented access
to our clients &apos; books .
which , of course , you won &apos;t be doing .
no , we won &apos;t .
so what exactly am i getting out of this ?
you get to save face .
i do like my face .
however , i also like my ass ,
which will be on the line if i take this deal .
then you have 24 hours to decide which one you like more .
mr. forstman , mike ross .
no .
sir , i think that if you hear me out--
how the hell did you find me here ?
the article in forbes said
you can &apos;t go more than three hours
without rosa &apos;s cafe cubanos .
that article in forbes was six years ago .
it also said you never change .
did you also read where i have
every bud fox wannabe dumped in a local landfill ?
if you do that ,
you &apos;ll miss the opportunity to get back at harvey specter .
and what does a little shit like you
know about harvey specter ?
i know that he bought that &apos; 63 aston martin
out from under you ,
and you &apos;ve hated him ever since .
you know he keeps it in a garage ?
doesn &apos;t even drive it .
what do you want ?
gillis industries .
gillis industries ...
is a black hole of distressed debt .
i want nothing to do with it .
no , it isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s a &apos; 63 aston martin .
who do you work for ?
who says i work for anyone ?
because a young kid like you
with enough clout to go after gillis ...
i &apos;d know you .
i work for jonathan sidwell .
okay . you &apos;ve got my 230 mil .
i only need 80 .
you don &apos;t know what you need .
what happens to the company is my call .
done .
oh , one more thing , when you get those papers .
i have a feeling there &apos;ll be a provision buried in there
that says that once the deal closes ,
you cut sidwell out .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
i don &apos;t know him ,
and i want him sucking a chunk out of a deal
that can &apos;t happen without me .
well ?
he went for it .
that is great .
no , it &apos;s not all great .
he &apos;ll only give me the money if i agree to cut out sidwell .
what ?
what does cut him out even mean ?
it means make sure sidwell
doesn &apos;t get a penny from this deal .
mike , the second he finds that out , you &apos;re gone .
he &apos;s not gonna find out until the deal closes ,
and if i don &apos;t find the money , i &apos;m out of a job anyway .
oh , i get it .
at least this way , you get to leave on the winning side .
we leave on the winning side .
who says i &apos;m gonna do that ?
what happened to , &quot; you think i &apos;m staying if you leave &quot; ?
yeah , that was before i knew
you were gonna screw over sidwell .
amy , i--
no , he may be a dick sometimes ,
but he &apos;s the reason you &apos;re here .
you think i want this ?
i have to make a choice between the promise
i made to walter gillis
and what i owe jonathan .
mike , walter gillis doesn &apos;t give a shit
about that promise anymore .
yeah , but i do ,
and so do all the people that work for him .
so you &apos;re gonna do it .
i don &apos;t know .
but i do know that i keep having to do shitty things
just to win this thing ,
but i &apos;m gonna go make up for one of them right now .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t do what you asked me to do .
i should have evaluated your ideas .
you should have ,
but i should have remembered
that you don &apos;t always do what people expect of you .
you mean what people tell me to do .
i chose the nicer version .
well , i , um ...
i finished what i should have done in the first place .
and ?
and let &apos;s go through them .
what are you doing here ?
waiting for you .
i figured if i tried to go upstairs ,
you &apos;d have me killed .
oh , is that a joke , &apos; cause i &apos;m not laughing .
louis , i didn &apos;t say it right the first time .
i want to say it again . i &apos;m sorry .
you think &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; makes up for what you did ?
no , but i &apos;m hoping that we can move past it
and be friends again .
well , the only problem with that is ,
is that you and i both know that you &apos;re only here
because i took away your sugar daddy ,
and now you want me to take it easy on you .
louis , if you don &apos;t want to accept my apology , that &apos;s fine ,
but i &apos;m not here from a position of weakness .
i &apos;m here from a position of strength .
bullshit . where &apos;d you get money ?
you don &apos;t have any friends out there .
no , but harvey has enemies .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you told me these guys hold grudges .
i just found a guy with one against harvey .
you son of a bitch .
you didn &apos;t come here to apologize .
you came here to rub it in my face .
oh , and i bet you just can &apos;t wait to tell harvey
that i &apos;m the one who gave you the idea .
louis , i wasn &apos;t even gonna tell you
how i got the idea at all .
i &apos;m still not gonna tell harvey .
because you want me to owe you ?
because i &apos;m not as much of an asshole
as you think i am .
what about a buyout ?
never gonna happen .
he &apos;s got a golden parachute .
管理人员离职时 会得到大额经济补偿的制度
well , then i &apos;ve got two people on the board .
i can force a vote .
you do that , it triggers a stock split .
his shares double in voting power .
yours don &apos;t .
i mean , that &apos;s all five .
none of them work .
no , they don &apos;t .
so when you told me you should have evaluated my ideas first ,
you weren &apos;t saying that they were good .
i was saying i wasn &apos;t doing my job .
which was to let me figure out for myself
that my ideas weren &apos;t good .
i chose the nicer version .
logan , there are plenty of other companies out there .
none that we &apos;re gonna find in time
for my board meeting tomorrow .
so push it .
i can &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t call it .
and i thought--
yeah , i know .
that i only even arranged it to spend time with you ?
you really didn &apos;t .
no , and now they &apos;re gonna ask me tomorrow
how gillis is going ,
and i &apos;m gonna have to tell them we might lose ,
and then they &apos;re gonna ask me what else i have ,
and i &apos;m gonna have to tell them nothing .
or maybe you won &apos;t .
i told you , i &apos;m not in that business .
then convince the board that you should be .
okay .
go back to your office .
get your files .
like you said ,
i don &apos;t always do what people expect me to do .
louis , can i talk to you for a minute ?
of course .
i heard about what you did with gianopolous .
good job .
i appreciate that , harvey . i do .
but it doesn &apos;t matter .
you know , he went somewhere else .
i know .
he went to forstman .
i just wanted to tell you you did a good job anyway .
see , that &apos;s the thing .
i didn &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
mike got the idea from me .
what ?
how ?
when i cut him off from gianopolous ,
i stuck it in his face ,
and i told him that people hold grudges , and i--
he must have known your history with forstman ,
and that &apos;s why he went to him , so ...
i &apos;m sorry .
god damn it , louis .
i don &apos;t want to keep being mad at you ,
but you keep doing the same shit .
but , see , this wasn &apos;t me being duped .
no , it was you letting your emotions
lead you into doing something stupid .
again .
you just had to stick it in his face .
you know what ?
i &apos;m done .
it &apos;s not fair , you know .
i &apos;m emotional . you &apos;re cold .
you &apos;re loved ,
and i &apos;m hated .
louis , if i was so cold ,
i wouldn &apos;t have come here in the first place .
what are you doing ?
pouring us a drink .
cahill took the deal .
all seven cases are officially dead .
jessica , i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t come clean with you before .
me too .
lying to you was a business decision ,
and it was wrong ,
but i want you to know
that i would never lie to you , man to woman .
i appreciate that .
we have a problem .
i just got off the phone with richard coleman .
last week , sean cahill asked him
if i &apos;d ever crossed any lines in his presence .
son of a bitch .
he doesn &apos;t want our clients to leave us .
he wants them to cough up dirt on me .
at least none of them did , or we &apos;d be in trouble right now .
how do you want to handle it ?
let &apos;s talk about it tomorrow .
right now , i &apos;ve got something else to do .
shit .
they wouldn &apos;t turn on harvey .
cahill wanted us to drop those cases anyway ,
and i just did him a big favor .
you couldn &apos;t have known that .
it was my job to know that .
hey , mike ?
yeah .
harvey specter &apos;s here to--
harvey , what can i do for you ?
i wanted to thank you for the recordings .
is that why you came all the way down here ?
i came to tell you i think you &apos;re making a big mistake
getting into bed with forstman .
i knew it .
mike , you don &apos;t know this guy .
you could have thanked me for those recordings days ago ,
but instead you picked the exact day
that i find a new investor to show up
with your thank @-@ you and your friendly advice .
this isn &apos;t some move .
you only make moves .
mike .
hey , tell me right now
that you wouldn &apos;t do the same thing
if you were in my position .
i was .
and i did .
what ?
you think our grudge is about some car ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
when i was younger , i made a shady deal with him ,
and i paid for it .
who says that i &apos;m making--
if you haven &apos;t , you will ,
because forstman doesn &apos;t throw money around
without getting something in return .
he &apos;s gonna get money in return .
money is third on his list .
the first two are getting back at people
and getting control of people .
maybe you should have thought of that
before you had louis cut me off from gianopolous ,
because now i have no other choice !
you always have a choice .
here &apos;s to turning around piedmont avionics .
what ?
nothing .
what time is it ?
too late for you to change your mind .
logan , the board is going to be wowed .
well , i wish i had your confidence .
you are not short in the confidence department .
oh , you don &apos;t have to pay me compliments .
i meant it as an insult .
you know , if this law thing doesn &apos;t work out--
then i could have a career in venture capital ?
no , i was gonna say you could be my assistant .
hilarious .
seriously , rachel , i--
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
yes , you could have .
it just wouldn &apos;t have been as good .
humility .
another thing i love about you .
logan , i should go .
rachel , i--
good luck tomorrow .
