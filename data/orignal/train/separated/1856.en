How much can you actually accomplish in an hour?
Run an errand maybe?
Sit in traffic?
Get an oil change?
When you think about it, an hour isn't very long.
60 minutes.
3,600 seconds.
That's it.
In medicine, though,
an hour is often everything.
We call it the golden hour.
That magical window of time
that can determine whether a patient lives...
or dies.
Thank you, doctor.
Are you gonna help me at all
or are you just gonna sit there and eat potato chips?
I performed four back-to-back fem-pop bypasses today.
This is the first chair I've seen since 7:00 a.m.,
and this is the first food I've had since yesterday.
I choose potato chips.
You might want to get that.
Seattle Grace Mercy West Emergency.
You brought this on yourself, you know?
You volunteered to help run the E.R.?
Got it.
We've got a suspected appy on a 10 year old.
Let's page Robbins.
You know, I saw a need and I filled it,
like any good chief resident candidate.
Sadomasocochisc chief resident candidate maybe.
What is up with you?
You're all perky and cheerful.
Ah, you know, it's the, uh, fertility drugs.
We have stepped it up. I'm pumped full of hormones.
You know what's perky?
Quoi?
My boobs. They're huge.
Am I supposed to like big boobs?
Oh, God, no. They'll make you fall over.
Callie mentioned a thing.
Or it might not be a thing.
At least I hope it doesn't become a thing.
Hey, I got a patient with a headache better after sumatriptan.
He's ready to be discharged.
Just need you to sign off.
Is he neurologically intact?
You did a C.T.?
I did. It was negative. The most interesting thing
about this guy is that he came into the E.R.
for a glorified migraine
with a girlfriend from hell.
Ooh, which one is she?
Just point with your eyes.
Here. Thank you.
So, um, Callie had a thing.
Yeah.
What kind of a thing?
Grey, you paged?
Yeah, we have a suspected appy on a 10 year old
two minutes out.
Okay.
An unexpected thing.
Grey, call up. Tell 'em to get an O.R. ready.
I already did. O.R. Five is prepped and ready for you.
Callie asked me to be her baby's godmother.
Well, you said no to that, right?
You gotta say no to that.
E.K.G. results.
Thank you.
The guys at work overreacted and insisted I come to the E.R.
Sweetie, I had a big lunch. It hardly qualifies as chest pain.
No, what I need are some antacids.
I'll be there. I promise. Just tell max to put on his jersey.
Okay? I'll be outta here soon.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll be your doctor today.
Oliver Richter. Sorry about the phone.
I'm supposed to be picking up my son for the Huskies game right now.
I'm sure he'll understand.
You don't know my son.
There are very few things more important to him than basketball.
Big fan, huh?
I'm just gonna take a quick listen.
All right.
The biggest 9-year-old fan you've ever seen.
Okay. So it says here
that you've been experiencing some chest pain.
When did that start?
Uh, an hour ago, maybe two?
But I'm already feeling much better.
And you wouldn't just be saying that to get discharged faster?
Look, I got my son tickets to this game for his birthday.
He's been marking off the days on his calendar for weeks.
I can't be the reason he misses it.
Okay. Well, your E.K.G. looks normal,
and your heart sounds good, but if there's one thing
we don't take lightly around here, it's chest pain, so...
Could we go back and just pretend I said heartburn?
Would that get me out any faster?
No, probably not.
But Tyler is going to do a portable chest X-ray.
And we're gonna do a chest pain workup,
and we will try to make it as quick as possible.
Thanks, Dr. Grey, so much. Thanks.
So... this is gonna be a thing.
Why am I telling Callie no again?
Um, while you're here,
I need a second opinion on this E.K.G.
Do you see anything?
No. Looks, uh, normal. What are you doing here?
Thought you had the night off.
Yeah, I do. I'm not here.
What's medical records' extension?
Looks like you're here to me, which is good,
because we're swamped. Take your pick--
impacted bowel, suspicious rash, or really smelly guy.
Forget it. I only came in 'cause medical records called
and said I had to sign all my unsigned charts
or they would suspend my privileges.
You're getting suspended?
Dibs on his solo splenectomy tomorrow.
I better be able to finish this crap before the game tonight.
Told a patient yesterday he didn't have cancer,
and he was so happy, he gave me two floor seats.
You took a gift from a patient?
Did you tell him you cured his cancer?
Uh, colectomy time. I'm out.
Excuse me. Hi, I-I'm sorry.
Uh, we were told that somebody would be by
to set our son's leg-- Nathan Englundar.
It was a while ago. Several hours, actually. And I was--
No, I know. You've been here a while. I'm sorry.
The problem is, we just don't have enough O.R.s available
for non-emergent cases.
An O.R.? Why would you need an O.R.?
Your piatrician hasn't been by to speak to you yet?
Your son has a broken femur, which is a severe break.
It requires a full cast on the broken leg, connected to
a cast on the other leg to keep everything still
so the bones will heal properly.
2 full-leg casts on a 4 year old?
And because your son is so young,
we can't set the bones properly without
putting him under.
Under meaning anesthesia?
And that requires an O.R.
I'm sorry. I know you've been waiting a long time.
As soon as an O.R. opens up,
I'll let you know.
Thank you. Thank you.
The losers in medical records aren't answering.
Are you sure you can't stay
and help out with some of this stuff?
Floor seats.
I understand what you are suggesting.
I know it is done by many medical professionals in this hospital.
But I am not a medical professional
who would ever consider--
Maybe you should consider it.
Eli Lloyd... do not test me.
Maybe you should consider the potential benefits.
All the intensely exciting, toe-curling potential...
benefits.
Dr. Bailey.
Okay, uh, this is gonna be
for a prescription-strength migraine medicine.
Just don't take it with alcohol.
Okay.
We're missing our anniversary dinner
because you have a headache. A headache.
Do you know how hard it is to get reservations at this place?
I'm sorry, Gia. I am. But it really hurts.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll be--
Oh, Mrs. Webber.
Hi, dear. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
Does the chief know you're here?
Oh, please don't bother him.
I had a little fall is all.
Got home from work, slipped off the stepladder--
landed on my wrist.
Oh, it's basasically nothing. Ohh.
Well, it's not nothing.
Well, I-I brought lots of magazines and a good novel.
I am perfectly fine waiting until you make time for me.
I know you have far more pressing patients.
Well, you're the chief's wife,
so that makes you my most pressing patient.
Look, Stew-man. They opened the doors right for us.
Are you sure about that?
This is gonna be fast. We'll be in and out, man.
But I can't believe you wouldn't let me drive,dude.
Dude, you're drunker than I am.
I can't believe you tried to stiff the cabbie.
Wow, it is bright in here.
Hey, could somebody do something about this?
You're a little early. I thought our date was at 6:30.
Well, I'm here now because a guy just walked into the pit
with a knife sticking out of his head.
Sweet.
I mean, poor guy.
Is he stable?
He's neurologically intact, but--
All right. Well, I need to check on him sooner than later,
so, Avery, take him down to C.T.
Stay with him until I get there.
All right. Will do.
Okay, so you'll be down
to see knife guy when you're done?
I will.
And then we'll have our date?
Wouldn't miss it.
6:30. Don't forget.
How did this guy get a knife in his head?
Oh, apparently there was a brawl at a tailgate party.
So you know how stupid guys get--Dr. Bailey.
Uh, I'm taking a nap.
Uh, I'm sorry.
What I-I mean to say is,
I'm going to use this room to take a nap,
because that's what people do in these rooms
when they're tired,
'cause I-I have a child and a full-time job,
and work long hours,
so I'm just tired,
just very... ve tired.
Okay.
Okay.
I-I was just gonna ask you, had you seen Dr. Altman?
D--no, I have not seen Dr. Altman
nor any other doctors or nurses,
because I will be in this room asleep, by myself.
Actually, I see her now. Dr. Altman.
I'm--I'm--I...
Dr. Altman, do you have time for a quick consult?
I was supposed to be off by 6:00, but--
Oh, okay, sure. Okay. Just walk with me.
Okay, so-- oh, damn it.
He's early. Um...
All right, just, uh, Grey, give me a second.
Hi, uh, William.
Hey. It's, uh, it's nice to see you.
Wow. You look amazing.
Oh. So official.
I mean, I-I knew you were a doctor,
But you... are a doctor.
Thanks. Sorry, I didn't-- I didn't have time to change.
I'm just--
No, no, no. The scrubs are strangely sexy.
Thanks. Um, you know, I have a few things to wrap up.
Do you mind hanging out for a few minutes?
Like, uh, ten tops?
Yeah, no problem. Take your time.
I'll just, uh, grab a seat here.
Hey, stranger.
Henry.
I didn't, uh, I didn't-- I didn't know that you were,
uh, you were here today.
they wanted to run a blood glucose test on me,
so they gave me this nasty orange kool-aid to drink.
In about an hour, I gotta go give 'em some blood or pee.
And we don't really need to talk about my bodily fluids.
Sorry to be rude. Hi. Hey.
Oh, sorry. Um, yeah.
William, Henry. Henry, William.
Are you, uh, are you a patient of Teddy's?
Something like that.
Anyway, I, um, I-I gotta go.
Uh, but I'll be back soon.
Promise.
All right, Grey, what do you got?
Okay, 42-year-old male,
um, complaining of midsternal chest pain.
No cardiac risk factors, no angina.
Pain doesn't radiate. The E.K.G. looks clean.
These are his films,
and they're mostly clear.
But I don't know.
Does the mediastinum look a little wide to you?
Because I know, sometimes that can happen
with the portable X-ray.
You got cardiac enzymes?
Yes.
Hey, Kepner.
How good are you at forging signatures?
Even if I were good at forging signatures, I wouldn't do it.
It's unethical and probably illegal. So I'm sorry.
You're just gonna have to finish signing your charts on your own.
I'll check on Mr. Richter right now. Call radiology.
Get him in for P.A. and lateral films,
and tell 'em to rush it,
because I'd really like to get outta here and go on my date.
I mean, did you see that guy?
No forging snatures, Karev.
Radioly, please.
Forgery, huh? Why am I not surprised?
Whatever. I just want to get outta here
so I can get to this game tonight.
Wait. You have tickets?
Tonight? It's the pac-10 title game.
Yeah, I know.
Win this, and the Huskies get
an automatic bid to March Madness.
Why do you think I'm powering through all these stupid charts?
Hey, what are you d-- what are you doing?
Of my ten patients in labor right now,
none of 'em are past 3 centimeters,
which means, I have some time to kill,
and you can't miss this game. Hand me a pen.
I thought you thought I was loser.
Well, you're a little less losery,
now I know you like college hoops.
Hey, where's the knife guy?
Is it true he's walking and talking?
What about your colectomy?
Postponed.
The wife snuck him a cheesebuburgrger and fries
before surgery.
So this thing with Callie--
I mean, you know it's a bad idea, right?
You don't want to be Callie's baby's godmother.
I don't?
No.
I mean, think of how many people have to die
before you even get to step up--
Mark, Callie, and Arizona.
That's a lot of people.
It is, yes. A lot of dead people.
Right.
Whereas if you're my baby's godmother-in-waiting,
it's only me and Derek.
One wrong turn down a dark, twisty road,
boom, you're in.
Okay, let's be clear.
If I am ever a godparent to anyone's kid,
it will be in name only.
I will not be taking care of children.
That's what boarding schools are for.
Which way to butcher block?
Trauma 2.
Okay. I understand you might be thirsty, but I'm sorry.
You cannot drink beer in here.
You're wasting it!
Oliver, did you see Dr. Altman?
Yeah, she's sending me off for another X-ray.
Look, I know you guys have to cover all your bases, but--
No, I know. I'm sorry.
But I put a rush on the X-ray,
so hopefully it'll be quick, okay?
Grey!
Excuse me.
I was finishing a surgery just now
when a scrub nurse asked me how my wife was feeling,
because she'd heard Adele was in the E.R., and I hadn't.
Now would you like to explain to me why I found out
my wife was a patient in this hospital
from my scrub nurse and not from you?
Richard, hush. Let Meredith do her job.
She hasn't even had a chance to examine me yet.
Is that true?
Don't mind him, dear. He's just worried about me.
He gets gruff when he's worried.
I hurt my wrist.
I was trying to get out the holiday decorations
and I--ohh--I slipped off the stepladder.
Oh, it was stupid. I should've waited for Richard to get home.
He's so much taller than me.
I requested an X-ray and an ortho consult.
I will call and make sure that they're coming down.
Don't touch that!
Ooh. I think I better go see what that is.
You better.
Is everything all right?
Yes.
No!
I was just showing these guys how,
when I scrunch up my eyebrows, the knife move. See?
Oh, my God! my God!
Stop! Whoa. Don't do that!
Stop moving the knife!
Okay, okay.
You guys should've seen the brawl.
Stew-ball kicked that other guy's ass!
Okay, and now Stewball has a knife in his head.
Oh. Okay, let's focus. Stewart, how much is 14 plus 4?
18.
27 minus 13.
15?
No.
172 minus 60.
I have no idea, but it's not because of the knife.
It's just 'cause I'm so drunk.
No, actually, it's just 'cause he's dumb.
Thanks, David. Really?
Unbelievable. His mental status is completely intact,
if you don't count for his math skills.
It's like the knife did no damage at all.
So why don't you just pull the thing out?
'cause we got a games to gets to!
I'll drinks to that! Whoo!
No! No beer!
Buzzkill.
Uh-oh!
How many do you have?
Okay. Oliver's in X-ray,
Stewart is stable and waiting for Derek,
who should be here soon,
Adele is waiting on ortho,
and, uh, can I get the discharges from the last hour, please?
Oh, and, uh, the boy in Bed Seven with the broken leg,
Nathan Englundar-- let's check on the status
of the O.R. for him, please.
Is this Lexie's patient with the headache?
Yeah.
Mitch Turner?
How long ago was he discharged?
Not long. A few minutes ago.
Did he leave? Did he already leave?
Mr. Turner!
Mr. Turner, I need you to try to smile for me, please.
Who the hell are you?
I need you to try to smile for me, please.
Okay, can you lift your arms above your head like this?
Dr. Grey, is everything all right?
No, it's not.
We got a code C.V.A. Let's get stretcher out here, stat.
Can you repeat after me? "The dog chased after the cat."
"The-- dog ch-chased af--"
What's going on? What's happening to him?
Okay, I need you to help me.
What's happening to him?!
We need to get him on the ground.
"The dog ch--"
Okay, get your purse under his head.
Quickly, please.
"The dog ch--"
Okay. And help me secure his arm. Hold it like this.
O-o-okay, but wh-why are we doing this?
Because he's having a stroke.
Unsteady gait, slurred speech, asymmetric smile.
His symptoms started no more than 20 minutes ago,
so we should be well within the golden hour.
Okay.
I know--a stroke, right in front of me.
I mean, what if he had been driving me
in the car when it happened?
Oh, wait. Hang on. Here's the doctor.
Hi. So the stroke team has taken him up to C.T.
We're gonna see if he's eligible for the clot-busting medicine.
We caught the stroke early, which is very good.
So--so on a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being I might have to cancel our Aspen trip in a week,
how is he?
You should cancel the trip.
You will not believe this.
Looks like the blade landed in the maxillary sinus.
Chances are, the knife itself is tamponading any major bleeding.
Probably best just to go ahead and open up the cranium.
Or we could just take him to the O.R.
And pull this thing out.
Really, Avery? Just pull it out?
Let me guess. You want to get out of here early
to go to the game, just like everyone else.
Or since it looks like the blade didn't hit any major arteries or veins,
he knows that a controlled extraction would be both safer and less invasive
than a complete craniotomy.
Is that true, Avery?
Is that why you suggested we pull it out of his head?
Yeah. And I want to get outta here early to get to the game.
Me, too. I'm good with that.
Let's just do what he said. Yeah!
Lexie, I need to speak with you.
Thank you for getting me out of that room.
I swear, it takes everything just to be civil to Mark lately.
Such an ass. What's up?
Take a look at this. Look closely.
What do you see?
This is the patient's admitting signature when he came in.
And this is his signature when he was discharged.
Oh, no.
Mitch Turner, the patient you just discharged,
is up in radiology being treated for a stroke.
Oh, God.
I know you know the signs of a stroke.
How did you miss this?
Are you distracted by the Mark thing?
Is that it?
No, I checked the C.T.
He was having a classic migraine.
He's had them before.
There's no way that he was having a stroke
when I treated him.
Lexie, I know you know,
this kind of headache can be a precursor to a stroke.
When you said you needed an ortho consult,
you could've mentioned it was the chief's wife, Grey.
I would've been down here a hell of a lot sooner.
I am so sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Webber.
You hurt your wrist in a fall?
Oh, it was so silly.
I'd just gotten home, and I was trying to get some--ohh!
reach something on the top shelf myself.
I-I just landed wrong.
Her wrist absorbed all the impact.
Yeah, it looks painful. We'll get you some more pain meds to
help you out with that. Uh, your X-ray shows a hairline fracture.
Oh. So it could have been a lot worse.
We'll splint you up and get you out of here in no time, okay?
You have me paged if you need anything, okay?
Thank you for covering for me before with the chief.
You didn't have to do that.
Excuse me?
When you said I hadn't been by to examine you yet.
So you said that
you fell when you got home... from work.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
Do you remember hitting your head when you fell?
Not that I recall.
Dr. Grey, I have the new X-rays for Oliver Richter.
Okay. Let's get Mrs. Webber a head C.T.
Oh, damn it.
Excuse me.
Sorry to make you wait.
No, no problem. Um, really.
Henry here has been keeping me company.
Although he's probably sick of me by now.
I've been grilling him about the major leagues.
You didn't mention he used to play pro ball.
Oh... I didn't know that he did.
It's not a big deal, really.
Although there is a baseball card out there with my face on it somewhere.
Look, I don't mean to hold you guys up.
You probably have a-a reservation waiting.
Excuse me, Dr. Altman. Mr. Richter--
mediastinum looks borderline on the P.A. Films. Take a look.
Okay, um... that reservation
may have to wait just a-a little bit longer.
I'm sorry. I mean, if you want to reschedule, I totally--
No. Nonsense. I'm--I'm happy to wait.
You are saving lives.
Least I can do is take you out to dinner when you're done.
Thank you.
Did you--you ever pitch against Jeff Bagwell?
Once,
and it wasn't pretty.
You were right. Get a C.T. to be safe,
and I'll stick around to look at the results.
At least somebody's having a good night.
Good news?
Or not such good news?
Oliver, your second X-ray is still concerning.
Dr. Altman and I agree that you should have a C.T.,
just to rule out anything serious.
And how--how long will that take?
Oh, that's my son calling.
He's worried we'll miss tip-off. What should I tell him?
Do I need to tell him we're gonna miss this game?
I wish I had an answer for you,
but I think it's a safe bet you'll be late.
Max. Hey, buddy.
How's my little man doing?
Oh, Daddy will be fine.
Don't you worry. Don't worry.
You just worry about all that popcorn we're gonna be eating.
Make sure he's on broad spectrum antibiotics.
You booked an O.R.?
Wow. It didn't hit any brain matter at all?
Doesn't look like it from this.
How long till Shepherd gets down here to take a look?
He should be out of surgery any minute.
Good. Longer that thing stays in there,
the higher the risk of infection...
One, two...
Or abscess formation.
So now can we get outta here?
How is he, Grey?
Pupils are equal and reactive. He's alert and awake.
Can I get some more gauze for this wound, please?
Reflexes seem normal.
Give me that.
I'm fine. It's just a little headache is all.
I've had hangovers worse than this.
All right. What's the status on the blade?
Well, about that--
Yeah, there is no blade anymore.
What, uh, what happened?
Sir, just lay back and let me examine you, okay?
Could we just get a doctor, please?
I want to take a look at the C.Ts.
It's okay, bud. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay, Nathan.
Mommy, help me.
He's really hurting.
Okay,
I'm gonna write an order for more pain meds.
It's okay, Monkey. I know you want to go home.
It'll just be a little while longer, okay?
It will just be a little longer, right?
Tyler, where is the O.R. for Nathan?
I haven't heard back yet.
Okay, well, let's call them again, and let's call
the ortho team and make sure they're ready to go, okay?
We will get to Nathan as soon as possible. I promise.
How's he doing?
Well, the blade went through his skull,
didn't hit any major nerves or arteries,
so he's gonna be fine.
Flesh wound?
Yeah.
I mean, that's the luckiest guy alive.
You're also pretty lucky, too.
It's past 6:30, and we haven't had our date yet.
I'm swamped. I can't leave.
I have one patient in C.T., another one waiting for an O.R.
Well, your patient's C.T. isn't ready yet.
No.
And the O.R. You're waiting for isn't either.
So okay. I mean, maybe I do right at this precise moment
have one minute, but it's a minute.
That's perfect.
That's all I need is a minute. I need a minute.
What--aah!
Oh, sorry.
What?!
No one. It was nothing. That room is occupied.
Uh, just never ask me what I might have seen
or might not have seen in there.
Okay, well,
If we can't go in there, where are we gonna go?
I have an idea.
Where are we going?
Nowhere. We're gonna do it here.
Wait. No we're not.
Come on.
No! No way! Are you kidding me?
No. Drop your pants.
Come on. I'll be quick. I'll be in and out.
Oh, my God.
Eyes up here! Seriously. Are you kidding me?
No, I'm serious about this.
Where is your sense of adventure?
My sense of adventure is down on the first floor.
It's not in this elevator.
Come on. If not for me,
then do it for your future baby.
Come on. Turn around.
I cannot believe I am doing this.
This future imaginary baby of ours better be worth it.
Okay. Here we go.
Ooh. Oh, there it is.
Ouch.
Ooh. There. I told you I'd be quick.
I can't wait to meet our future fictitious baby.
Me either.
We got through those charts fast.
Floor seats, here I come.
So I just helped you get through three dozen charts
in a fraction of the time
would have taken you to do on your own,
basically ensuring you get to your floor seats on time.
How long do I have to wait
till you ask me to go to the game with you?
Oh. I... I-I mean, I was supposed to take Avery,
but screw him.
Sure. You--you want to go?
No. I'm on call tonight, actually.
I just wanted to see if I could get you to ask me out.
Excuse me.
Just admit it. You like her.
Shut up.
God, I don't think you do understand, actually.
This has been going on since yesterday.
We took our son to an after-hours clinic
where he was misdiagnosed, and then he was sent home
without so much as a painkiller, and he was up all night crying.
And then this morning, our pediatrician sent us here.
And now we've been waiting around all day...
with our 4 year old son.
Believe me. I understand that a kid with a broken leg
doesn't take precedence over a guy with a knife in his head,
but my son is scared and he is in pain,
so could somebody please just get to his leg all ready?
Please.
Yes, sir.
You still haven't helped that kid yet?
He's 4 with a femur fracture. You know how much that hurts?
No, I know. It's just been one of those days.
Tyler, isn't that O.R. ready yet?
They're prepping it now.
Grey, my wife was cleared by Dr. Torres.
You ordered a head C.T. For a broken wrist?
Yeah, I can explain that, sir. I have some concerns--
Dr. Grey, they're calling from C.T.
Your patient's coding in the scanner.
What?
They say he's coding.
Hold C.P.R..
V-fib. Page Altman.
Give me the paddles now. Charge to 200.
Clear.
Charge to 300.
Clear.
Got a pulse.
Yes!
Scans are up.
Grey, talk to me.
Uh, he was coding whenen I got here.
I defibrillated him three times.
I gave him three rounds of epi, two of atropine.
I loaded him up with amiodarone, but he's tachycardic now.
I mean, he's barely hanging on.
He needs surgery. Book an O.R..
Okay. I'll get a room prepped and ready.
No time.
His aorta's dissecting as we speak.
He needs surgery right now.
They're saying all the O.R.s are booked.
Well, tell 'em to bump someone,
'cause we're come up either way.
I have an O.R.
Tell 'em to bump mine and prep it for an emergency cardio.
All right. Here we go.
Got it. Go.
All right. Let clear it.
Let's hold that elevator!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Once these doors open, we're gonna have to get him in the O.R..
And open him as soon as possible.
I know.
Even then, if that aorta tears,
we may already be too late.
And we're not gonna have time to scrub.
I know. I know.
Thanks.
Just pour the Betadine straight on to the chest.
It doesn't need to be pretty. We need to get in there.
All right. Plug me in.
Scalpel.
Here you go.
Cautery.
Here.
Cauterizing now.
Get in there quickly, Grey.
Time is myocardium.
All right. Saw.
Get that retractor ready.
This guy thought he had a bad case of heartburn.
He went from that to this in less than 45 minutes.
That's how these work. How's his pressure?
70s and dropping.
Retractor.
Every beat of his heart rips this tear a little bit wider.
All right.
How many of thesese ruptured dissections
have you caught in time to operate?
40. Maybe 50.
How many have you been able to save?
Three.
All right. I'm in.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Damn it.
He's bleeding out.
His aorta is wide open. All right, clamp.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Here.
All right, Grey. Let's try sucker bypass.
Cannulas.
It's not working. There's too much blood.
All right. Well, once we get him on bypass,
it'll be easier to control.
Heart's fibrillating.
All right. Cardiac massage.
Paddles.
I've almost got him cannulated.
Charge to 10. Clear.
Damn it. He's bleeding out of his nose and ears.
I've been loading him up with blood, F.F.P. and factor VII,
But I can't keep up with the losses.
Foley's full of blood, too.
He's DIC.
His cannula sites are oozing.
Let's push 3 of epi. Set me up for another shock.
Clear.
Damn it.
Well, what can we do? Just tell me what to do?
There's nothing. His aorta is in shreds.
Well, what about-
There is nothing left to do. Call it.
Call it, Grey.
No, I mean, we-
Grey, we got here too late.
These are almost impossible to catch.
There is nothing that we can do. I'm sorry.
We need to call it.
Time of death-- 18:52.
Hey. I heard you lost a patient.
You know, it's not that I don't want to share you.
I mean, I don't want to share you,
but that's not the reason I don't want you to be
Callie's baby's godmother.
Oh. Okay.
It just seems like, if you agree to be
Callie's baby's godmother,
you're saying that I'll never have a baby of my own.
Meredith, you know, I--
I'm in no way saying anything that--that--
I know. It just feels that way.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I, uh...
have to go have really uncomfortable conversation
with Callie now.
How about you? What are you up to?
Oh, I have to contact Oliver's family.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, wait. You got, uh...
blood or something.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, Chief.
About earlier--
It's all taken care of.
I checked Adele's head C.T. myself.
It was clean. Her wrist is in a splint.
And I'm taking her home now.
Well, I still have some concerns.
And if her C.T. was clean, then I have even more concerns.
Thank you, Meredith, but I assure you, Adele is fine.
Chief, she's been get things very confused.
Meredith, she is fine, and I'm taking her home right now.
Why was she getting Christmas decorations down in February?
Good night, Meredith.
And she said she had just gotten home from work.
Didn't she retire?
Meredith--
Chief, something isn't right.
Okay, that's enough.
Now I know what you're implying.
And while I appreciate your concern, that's enough.
Adele had a scare today. She had a fall.
Any number of things could account
for her mixing up a couple of details,
not the least of which is her being interrogated by you.
Now if something bigger were wrong with my wife,
I would know it.
You've got Alzheimer's on the brain.
I mean, you--you buy a car
and you start seeing it everywhere you look.
Now you've been working on this Alzheimer's trial 24/7.
I get it.
But Adele is not your mother, Meredith.
She's my wife.
Now good night.
Hi. I'm so sorry.
I got pulled into an emergency surgery.
Where is Nathan?
Actually, a-a doctor came by to get him a little bit ago.
He's getting his casts put on right now.
Great. That's great news.
Dr. Grey, we have a surgical abdomen in Bed Three.
Okay, let's just get Oliver Richter's chart.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi, Max.
This is-- no, it's your daddy's doctor.
Is your mom around?
An hour...
One hour...
can change everything...
forever.
Well, we'll have to keep you overnight for observation,
but your prognosis is very good.
Great.
So maybe we don't have to cancel
our Aspen trip after all.
I just had a stroke.
I know.
And you're worried about our travel plans?
Well... it's a nonrefundable trip.
Cancel the trip.
You know what? In fact, cancel all our trips.
How have I put up with you for two years?
I'm done with this.
We're done.
Get outta here.
Now, before you give me another stroke.
W-wait, wait.
Can I see your keys?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now you can go.
An hour can save your life.
*That's not as cool as my city*
So before he gets off the phone
and since I now have to go pee in a cup,
Uh, here is I have to say, this-- I basically spent the past hour
on a first date with William myself.
And I don't know how m much you know about the guy,
but this is what I know--
um, he wears driving gloves.
Yeah, and he doesn't live with his mother,
but until recently he lived above her house,
and he used the word "shant," and he wasn't being funny,
and he has yet to tell me a story about himself
in which he is not the hero.
So as, uh, as your husband... I think we can do better.
Good news. Not only was I able to push the reservation,
but I also got us a a table by the window.
Black truffle gnocchi awaits. Ready?
Ready.
An hour can change your mind.
*Be patient as long as I know how*
So when's your next break?
Okay. Unh-unh. No.
This... will
never happen again at work. Understood?
Sure.
Okay.
Until your next break.
Sometimes an hour is just a gift we give ourselves.
All right, Stewart, you're choosing to leave
against medical advice, so you're free to go,
but this is my number.
Now if you experience any of the neurological symptoms
on this sheet, you call me, all right?
Somebody should stay with you tonight
and have plenty of fluids-- not beer. Not beer.
Will do, doc.
Thanks, doc.
All right.
For some, an hour can mean almost nothing.
I can't believe he walked in with a knife in his head
and is walalking out an hour lar to go to a ball game.
Speaking of which...
any chance you want to go to the game, too?
Apparently Karev didn't want his floor seats.
So you interested?
Actually, yes.
Yes, I am.
*Be patient as long as I know how*
For others...
an hour makes all the difference in the world.
Now, Nathan, when you wake up,
you're gonna have two big casts on your legs.
But that's a good thing, because it means
it's gonna make your leg better, okay?
But right now, I have a very important question for you,
and that is, what is your favorite color?
Blue.
Blue it is, then.
Let's prep the blue casting material, please.
All right, I'm gonna take this mask, Nathan,
and I'm gonna lower it...
But in the end...
it's still just an hour...
One of many...
Many more to come.
60 minutes...
3,600 seconds...
That's it.
And then it starts all over again.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll be your doctor today.
It says here you've been experiencing some abdominal pain.
When did that start?
