you took everything from me , klaus .
let bygones be bygones . resentment gets old .
no one ever gets old ? revenge .
no .
what &apos;s the matter , klaus , missing something ?
three sleeping originals , four coffins .
who is in the locked box ?
i think i know who can open the coffin , stefan .
who is this ?
it &apos;s my mom .
i want to help you .
you have no magic and i don &apos;t trust you .
maybe you can help me get my magic back .
to break the sire bond , you &apos;ve to make yourself turn .
oh , my god .
run !
is he going to make it ?
not on his own .
what is that ?
vampire blood .
show me the coffins .
where &apos;s the fourth ?
it &apos;s not here .
i assume that means klaus didn &apos;t get his coffins .
i was only able to get one of them out in time--the locked one .
probably a good choice .
so why don &apos;t we talk about this ?
what did you do ?
elijah ?
you look surprised to see me .
so it wasn &apos;t you that removed the dagger from my chest .
you look like you could do with a drink .
and we have a lot to discuss , so shall we ?
easy ! i just finished renovating !
you know , you have every right to be mad at me ,
but i kept my word .
i reunited you with our family .
don &apos;t make me do this to you again , elijah !
come on . use it .
i dare you .
you &apos;ll have kol to death with .
mikael is dead .
what did you say ?
i killed him . with his own weapon .
he &apos;s gone , elijah , forever .
why do our family remain in these coffins ?
finn for over 900 years , kol for over a century .
because of stefan salvatore .
he holds the one thing keeping me from freeing them .
there are things that you do not know about our past , elijah .
our mother &apos;s death . things i never wanted you to know .
but i &apos;m ready to tell you now .
i only ask that you remember
the oath of loyalty you once swore to me .
what are you doing ?
always and forever .
i need you
to stand by my side .
be my brother .
help me ... destroy stefan ,
and i promise you ,
our family will be whole again .
morning .
thought we had aspirin .
yeah , in the vitamins .
you &apos;re hungover .
yeah , sorry about that .
it was a bit of a weird night .
i told you , you don &apos;t have to feel guilty
about inviting meredith over here .
i know .
and i thank you for that .
but i do feel a little guilty for
whisky dialing her at 2 in the a.m.
no , you didn &apos;t .
oh , yes , i did .
was she cool about it ?
well , as soon as these aspirin kick in
and i remember the conversation ,
i &apos;ll let you know .
sheriff forbes , hi .
is everything ok ?
this is an unconventional
conversation we &apos;re about to have ,
so i hope you &apos;ll protect me on it .
of course .
i assume you both heard our medical examiner was murdered
the night of the wickery bridge fundraiser .
yeah .
brian walters . why ?
we &apos;ve been investigating .
someone drove this stake through his heart .
it &apos;s one of ours .
i mean , this is one of a set from your parents &apos; lake house .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . i haven &apos;t told anyone ,
but forensics ran it for prints
and found only one clean set .
yours .
what ?
so you &apos;re the prime suspect , huh ?
she doesn &apos;t think that i did it .
she &apos;s just trying to find out why
someone used one of my family &apos;s weapons to kill a council member .
well , why don &apos;t you just ask ric
if his dirty little doctor had access to the weapons .
you &apos;re on speaker phone , dick .
i &apos;m just saying ,
first suspect is usually the right one .
don &apos;t get so defensive .
brian walters was killed days ago , all right ?
i didn &apos;t show meredith this stuff until last night .
it wasn &apos;t meredith .
but brian walters was her ex @-@ boyfriend
and ric saw them fighting that night .
it &apos;s not meredith . ok ?
i refuse to believe that your luck with women is that tragic .
who else knows about your secret little slayer stash ?
who doesn &apos;t ? i &apos;ve got weapons everywhere .
here , the school , my loft , your car .
it &apos;s klaus . has to be .
he &apos;s just screwing with us .
i wonder if it was stefan .
he was crazy that night .
you know , he was trying to get underneath klaus &apos; skin .
he was capable of pretty much anything .
ah , makes me nostalgic for the time
when stefan was a bunny @-@ snacking pacifist .
anyway , got to go . more later .
hey , where are you ?
tea with an old friend .
elijah .
my favorite original ,
back from the dead .
you clean up nice .
you left something ...
in my jacket pocket .
oh , yeah .
dear elijah ,
let &apos;s get together ,
plot the destruction of your brother .
xo , xo .
damon .
was i right to undagger you ,
or are we going to have a problem ?
i &apos;m here . let &apos;s talk .
well , let &apos;s start with an easy question ...
any idea what kind of klaus killing weapon
could be magically sealed in a mystery coffin ?
slow down !
keep up . we don &apos;t have much time .
sorry , stefan , but i didn &apos;t have a choice .
there was a choice , bonnie . you made it
and now we have to live with it .
i told klaus where the coffins were , and he took them .
all of them except this one .
that &apos;s the one that &apos;s sealed ?
yep .
unfortunately , it seems to be the one he cares about most .
aren &apos;t you coming inside ?
vampires can &apos;t get in . damon had to compel
a couple of the lockwood gardeners to bring the coffin in .
this is a bad idea .
look , if you &apos;re really the key to opening up that coffin ,
i think it &apos;s a pretty safe bet you &apos;re on klaus &apos; hit list .
so i suggest you hide out in here
and figure out a way to open the damn thing .
i told you , i don &apos;t have any powers .
and i don &apos;t believe you .
time &apos;s ticking .
won &apos;t be long before klaus calls his hybrids
to find that coffin and kill all of us .
so dig deep , abby bennett .
scrape out whatever magic you have left .
what are you doing here ?
bonnie told me that you guys would be here .
i need to talk to you .
well , there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
i &apos;m just focused on getting this coffin open .
did you kill the medical examiner ?
why would you think i did that ?
maybe because i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re capable of anymore .
well , believe what you want , elena .
i don &apos;t want to believe any of it , stefan .
but you had to ask me anyway .
stefan ...
did you ask damon
if he killed anybody lately ?
are you caroline ?
yes . dr. fell , hi .
elena told me you helped out my dad .
i did . do you think you can get him to be a little more grateful ?
he spent half the night threatening to get
my medical license revoked for saving his life .
yeah , my dad &apos;s a little ... set in his ways .
um , he spent his whole life hating vampires .
so--
so he &apos;s not psyched about it being vampire blood that healed him .
yeah , he made that clear .
i &apos;m sorry .
my bedside manner sucks on no sleep .
um , so , can i take him home ?
i signed his discharge papers late last night ,
just to shut him up .
oh , i ...
he didn &apos;t call or anything .
that &apos;s got to be hard .
when your dad hates the one thing you can &apos;t change about yourself .
i make it my business to know who the vampires are in this town .
medical curiosity . i don &apos;t blab .
yeah , we &apos;ve had our ups and downs .
tell your dad i said you &apos;re welcome .
thanks .
that was fast .
yeah , he &apos;s not here . he was already discharged .
and she seems perfectly nice , by the way .
a little intense , maybe .
but i think it &apos;s sweet you want to make sure
alaric &apos;s not dating a total psycho .
he &apos;s my family . i have to look out for him .
shh , shh , shh .
what ?
i hear it .
hear what ?
my dad &apos;s phone .
oh , my god ! dad ! daddy ! dad ? ! oh !
oh , my god .
don &apos;t be dead , don &apos;t be dead , don &apos;t be dead !
oh , my god !
daddy !
caroline ...
he has vampire blood in his system .
what ? !
this is the only grimoire you kept ?
it was the only one i needed .
so ... what is all of this ?
family history .
about a mother who loved her children so much ,
she couldn &apos;t bear the thought she might lose them .
so she turned them into vampires .
one of them is klaus .
the one you &apos;re trying to kill with whatever &apos;s in that coffin ?
there &apos;s nothing in here that &apos;s going to help .
i &apos;ve seen most of these spells .
what was this ?
it &apos;s the spell i used to seal mikael in the tomb .
i burned it , tried to get it out of my head .
didn &apos;t work , though .
wait ... do you see this ?
it &apos;s a sealing spell .
we &apos;re trying to open something . not seal it shut .
no . right here . on the side .
it &apos;s a blood knot . it means to bind it , you need two generations .
a bloodline .
like , two keys to a safety deposit box .
so ...
unbinding it
would reverse the spell .
unseal it .
if we did it together .
get dressed . we &apos;re going out .
yeah , sorry , not interested .
i didn &apos;t ask . elijah and i have
scheduled a very old @-@ fashioned sit @-@ down with you and klaus .
i say go with the black .
makes you look all villain @-@ y .
klaus won &apos;t make a deal , damon .
he didn &apos;t have to .
all we &apos;re doing is buying a little time
to give our wicked witches a chance
to pop the top off the coffin .
so that &apos;s your , uh , your plan ? stall klaus .
well , if you hadn &apos;t gone postal on his hybrids ,
then maybe i &apos;d have some options .
so you unleash an original to help him out .
undaggering elijah was smart , stefan .
are you kidding me ? after what klaus did to him ,
he &apos;s in vengeance mode . it &apos;s perfect .
nothing smart about trusting elijah , damon .
he screwed us over the last time .
he promised to help us kill klaus .
yeah , the way you &apos;ve been acting ,
i &apos;d trust him about as much as i trust you .
hmm . well ...
guess that goes both ways , doesn &apos;t it ?
oh , yes .
this is about me kissing elena .
just remember , if it wasn &apos;t for klaus ,
you wouldn &apos;t have become such a dick
and that kiss would never have happened .
so get ready and get happy .
we &apos;re going to negotiate a fake truce ,
and i don &apos;t want your attitude screwing it up .
i compelled the nurse to stay out of this room .
you &apos;ll be safe here .
my wound has completely healed .
i need something to eat .
daddy , why don &apos;t you just come lay down and just relax .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m too wired and my pulse is racing .
that &apos;s the effect of my body wanting to transition .
well , maybe dr. fell could give you something .
she &apos;s done enough .
i called your mom .
thanks .
mr. forbes , did you see your attacker ?
i didn &apos;t see anything .
tried to sneak out the back exit and someone came up from behind .
look , we &apos;ll figure this out , but in the meantime ,
we need to get you some blood .
i &apos;m not going to drink any blood .
you have to .
you died with vampire blood in your system .
if you don &apos;t feed and finish the transition
into a vampire , then you &apos;ll die .
i understand how it works .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m prepared to do .
now get me out of this hospital .
i smell blood everywhere .
what are you doing ?
taking inventory . did you bring it ?
you mean did i steal evidence from a crime scene ?
yes .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s a match .
this is from a crawl space in the foyer .
which means meredith knew where it was .
that doesn &apos;t mean she stole it .
this is from the loft .
these are from the duffel in damon &apos;s car .
identical to the one that killed brian walters .
damon &apos;s car was at the wickery bridge fundraiser .
so was meredith . and that was the night
her ex- boyfriend , the medical examiner , was killed .
the one who called her psycho .
if she was trying to save bill forbes ,
why would she turn around and try to kill him ?
i don &apos;t know what to believe , either .
you know , but ...
we &apos;d be idiots to ignore all these facts .
so what should we do ?
get this to the police .
then you should probably be with caroline .
i &apos;m sorry , ric .
please be careful .
niklaus , our guests have arrived .
damon . stefan .
elijah tells me you seek an audience .
very bold .
let &apos;s discuss the term of our agreement
like civilized men , shall we ?
it &apos;s better to indulge him .
i didn &apos;t , uh ,
come here to eat , klaus .
in fact , i didn &apos;t want to come here at all .
but i was told i had to ,
&apos;cause you would hear us out .
well , we can sit and eat ,
or i can reach down your throats
and pull out your insides .
choice is yours .
thank you , love .
you lost your appetite .
eat . i thought we agreed
that we would leave the grumpy stefan at home .
that &apos;s the spirit .
isn &apos;t this nice ?
the four of us dining together .
such a treat .
is this what you had in mind
when you pulled the dagger out of my brother ?
well , i know what he felt about you ,
so i figured , the more ... the merrier .
well , elijah and i have had our share
of quarrels over the centuries , but we always make it through .
kind of like , uh , you and rebekah , right ?
where is she , by the way ?
last i checked , she was still daggered ,
because you were afraid to face her .
if you &apos;re referring to the fact
that rebekah knows i killed our mother ...
i &apos;ve already come clean to elijah .
hey , stef , remember when you killed dad ?
might want to dial down the judgment till dessert .
we &apos;re here to make a deal , damon .
doesn &apos;t mean we need to kiss his ass for seven courses .
i &apos;m just saying , we have a long evening ahead of us .
pace yourself .
did you hear back from tyler yet ?
no .
and i &apos;ve left messages for him everywhere .
i ...
so does alaric really think that dr. fell did it ?
he doesn &apos;t know what to think .
what about you ?
i wish the girl alaric liked
wasn &apos;t in the middle of all of this .
he deserves to be happy .
but , yeah . she looks guilty .
that &apos;s why i told your mom .
my mom &apos;s in there sitting with my dad .
and i don &apos;t think they &apos;ve been in the same room
this long since i was 10 years old .
is there any chance that tyler did it ?
what ?
if klaus was trying to mess with you ,
and he &apos;s sired to klaus , and ...
he does everything that he &apos;s told ...
no .
no , i don &apos;t think tyler did it .
well , i can &apos;t just let my father die .
i &apos;m going ... i &apos;m going to force him to feed .
but he doesn &apos;t want to , caroline .
the only thing your dad has ...
is his choice .
i hated him so much for what he did to me .
so much .
now all i want to do is save his life .
well , of course you do . he &apos;s your dad .
what was the hardest part for you ?
when you lost your dad ?
realizing all the things
that he wouldn &apos;t be there for .
the things that , um ...
that you just need your dad for , you know ?
stefan . where is the lovely elena tonight ?
i don &apos;t know . ask damon .
i &apos;m sorry , you missed so much .
ah , trouble in paradise .
one more word about elena ,
and , uh , this dinner is over .
you know what , probably best just to keep elena
in the do not discuss pile .
you &apos;re probably right .
yeah .
it &apos;s just the allure of the petrova doppelganger is still so strong .
what do you say , brother ?
should we tell them about tatia ?
now why should we discuss matters long since resolved ?
well , given their shared affection for both elena and katerina ,
i think our guests might be curious to learn about
the originator of the petrova line .
well , we &apos;re not going anywhere , elijah .
please , do tell .
when our family first settled here ,
there was a girl named tatia .
she was an exquisite beauty .
every boy of age desired to be her suitor .
even though she &apos;d had a child by another man .
and none loved her more than niklaus .
oh , i &apos;d say there was one
who loved her at least as much .
wait a minute , so you both loved the same girl ?
our mother was a very powerful witch .
she sought to end our feud over tatia ,
and so she took her .
and klaus and i would later learn
that it was tatia &apos;s blood that we consumed
in the wine on the night where our mother
performed the spell which turned us into vampires .
tatia wouldn &apos;t make a decision between the two of us ,
so for a time , niklaus and i ...
grew estranged .
harsh words were traded .
we even came to blows . didn &apos;t we , brother ?
but in the end , we recognized
the sacred bond of family .
family above ... all .
family above all .
you &apos;re not trying .
we &apos;ve been at this for over an hour .
the spirits are angry with me ,
for leaving you .
maybe they didn &apos;t want to me to have my powers again .
i had all those dreams for a reason .
the spirits wanted me to find you ,
because you &apos;re my mom .
it &apos;s not them .
it &apos;s you .
you won &apos;t open yourself up to it .
do you know dad never talked about you ?
and neither did grams .
i had no memories of you .
so you know what i used to pretend ?
that you were dead .
it was ... easier to do that
than to wonder ...
why you never came back for me .
there &apos;s no way i can tell you
how sorry i am for what i did .
yes , there is .
you can help me .
it almost worked .
i have to call damon .
tell him we &apos;re getting closer .
i &apos;ll be right back .
ok .
so why don &apos;t we move this evening along
and discuss the terms of this proposal ?
well , that &apos;s very simple .
klaus gets his coffin back .
in exchange ,
he , and the original extended family ,
leave mystic falls forever .
me , stefan and elena live happily ever after ,
no grudges .
deal sounds fair , brother .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
elena &apos;s doppelganger blood
ensures that i will always have more hybrids
to fight those that oppose me .
i will never leave her behind .
let &apos;s say i do leave her here ,
under your protection . what then ?
how long before one of you turns her into a vampire ?
or worse .
how long before she dies , caught between your feuding ?
you see ,
each one of you truly believes
that you &apos;re the one that can protect her .
and that is simply a delusion .
gentlemen ...
the worst thing for elena gilbert is ...
the two of you .
i &apos;m going to get some air .
let me deal with this .
all this talk has made me thirsty .
what do you say , stefan ?
can i interest you
in a little after dinner drink ?
thanks for walking me home .
are you doing ok ?
this has to bring up a lot for you .
we &apos;ve all lost a lot .
it &apos;s this town .
it &apos;s messed up .
none of us should have to live this way .
that &apos;s weird .
the electricity must be out .
here .
i think i have some candles over there .
oh , my god !
what the hell ?
ric ! oh , my god ! oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god !
elena , leave it , he &apos;s lost too much blood !
i &apos;m going to call 911 .
ric , look at me .
who did this to you ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , my god ! there &apos;s a lot of blood , matt !
i know ! i know , elena , i know .
you have to kill me .
what ?
elena , you--
you have to kill me .
wait , wait , wait , matt , hang up .
hang up . he &apos;s right .
if he dies a supernatural death ,
then he &apos;ll come to life and he &apos;ll be healed .
but how do you know who did this is supernatural ?
that &apos;s what he &apos;s saying ! we don &apos;t , but ...
i &apos;m a doppelganger .
that makes me ... supernatural .
elena , no ! this is messed up !
he &apos;s dying , matt !
mmm . delicious .
aged to perfection .
well , i guess the only reason
you agreed to this evening , klaus ,
is to drive a wedge between me and my brother .
oh , no , you &apos;re doing that well enough on your own .
because of elena , you &apos;re going to lose your brother ,
and you &apos;ll only have yourself to blame .
what do you say , klaus ?
it &apos;s time for you to put something on the table .
we &apos;ve made our offer .
now you counter .
ok .
i offer elena &apos;s future happiness .
you see , what she needs right now
is to be rid of you lot ,
and to fall in love with a human .
maybe that nice football player ,
you know , the blonde one .
matt donovan ? really ?
yeah , why not ?
they &apos;ll marry , live a long and fruitful life ,
and pop out a perfect family .
and continue the petrova bloodline .
every few hundred years ,
you &apos;ll have a new doppelganger to drain
and never run out of hybrids .
right , klaus ?
consider it a small return on my investment in her well @-@ being .
see , after you hand me back the coffin ,
i &apos;ll ensure her safety for the rest of her natural life .
you know it &apos;s what &apos;s best for her .
so ...
what do you say , stefan ?
do we have a deal ?
what are you doing ?
nice try , klaus .
but no deal .
what are you doing ? !
stop !
now bring me my coffin
before i burn him alive .
i &apos;ll get it .
go with him , brother .
you keep him honest .
when you return , i will make good on my promise to you
and i will hand over our family .
your first state regionals .
yep . and i was afraid to join the squad .
and you talked me into it .
you had nothing to be afraid of .
you were so much better than all those other girls .
how are you feeling ?
i &apos;m tired .
can i get you anything ?
or ... do you want me to call steven ?
no , no , we haven &apos;t spoken in a while .
just ... call him when it &apos;s over
and the dust has settled , would you ?
yeah .
listen . listen to me . ok ?
i know that you think you made your choice .
but you can change your mind , you know ?
you are strong enough to handle being a vampire .
i mean , you &apos;re the strongest person that i know .
no , caroline , my strength is all in my beliefs .
becoming a vampire is wrong .
people aren &apos;t supposed to cheat death .
it &apos;s just ... what i believe .
please respect that .
how can you hate who i am so much ?
no , no , no , sweetheart , i don &apos;t hate you .
i love you .
you &apos;re strong . you &apos;re beautiful .
you &apos;re good .
no , i &apos;m not .
and even after everything that &apos;s happened to you ,
you are exactly who your mother and i hoped you &apos;d grow up to be .
then please don &apos;t leave me , daddy .
please ... please don &apos;t leave me !
daddy , just don &apos;t leave me .
parents aren &apos;t supposed to outlive their children , caroline .
it &apos;s ok .
this is life .
this is what it means to be human .
go ahead , kill me .
i know you &apos;ll do it when he brings the coffin .
you really have given up , haven &apos;t you , huh ?
where &apos;s the fight ? where &apos;s the ripper ? !
elijah .
why haven &apos;t you left ?
well , where are your manners , brother ?
you forgot dessert .
what have you done ?
what have you done ?
see , i &apos;ve learned not
to trust your vulgar promises , klaus .
we &apos;re doing this on my terms now .
kol .
long time , brother .
finn , don &apos;t !
rebekah !
this is for our mother .
you &apos;re free to go .
this is family business .
he &apos;s still out ?
caroline called .
her dad died .
will you stay with me ?
until he wakes up ?
of course .
i can &apos;t lose any more family .
well , you were right about elijah .
undaggering him was a smart move .
wow , actual acknowledgment of a job well done .
you going soft , stefan ?
so i guess i shouldn &apos;t thank you
for saving me from klaus .
shut up .
you don &apos;t get to thank me till i pay you back
for all of those times you saved me .
you could have left me there .
klaus would have killed me
and you would have had elena all to yourself .
i didn &apos;t do that on your account .
i love her , damon .
so do i.
i looked into it , elena .
meredith fell was called into surgery six hours ago .
she &apos;s been in there ever since .
she has an alibi ?
iron tight .
an operating room full of witnesses .
then who could it be ?
i don &apos;t know .
but the attack on alaric makes
this the third member of the founder &apos;s council ,
and we just cleared our only suspect .
let &apos;s hope big witch and little watch got that coffin open .
something &apos;s got to make this night worthwhile .
bonnie ? !
she &apos;s still breathing .
mama &apos;s still breathing , i can hear her .
coffin &apos;s open .
well , it &apos;s not going to do us any good .
whatever &apos;s in it &apos;s gone .
i like what you &apos;ve done with the new place , nik .
i wanted it to be for all of us .
a place we could all call home ;
a place we could all be a family .
none of us would ever have to be alone again .
you &apos;re right .
none of us will be .
you &apos;re staying behind .
we &apos;re leaving you , nik .
right after i kill that doppelganger wench .
and you will be alone .
always and forever .
you run .
i will hunt all of you down .
and then you &apos;ll become everything you hate .
our father .
i &apos;m the hybrid !
i can &apos;t be killed !
i have nothing to fear from any of you !
you will when we have that coffin .
mother ?
look at me .
do you know why i &apos;m here ?
you &apos;re here to kill me .
niklaus , you are my son .
and i am here to forgive you .
