i have a list here of the signing bonuses
of the top three associates who have come into this firm .
the advance , plus my salary , will cover my tuition .
those numbers don &apos;t add up .
some of the associates work as lawyers ,
and i can do the same .
it &apos;s an offer letter .
we &apos;re investment bankers .
our job blows yours out of the water .
harvey , stephanie liston just called me .
she said they just brought mike in for questioning .
you &apos;re a dirty lawyer , and now you &apos;re on my radar .
i &apos;m tired of putting the people i care about in jeopardy .
i called jonathan sidwell this afternoon .
i took the job .
mike ross never went to law school .
i knew it , and i hired him anyway .
i still can &apos;t stay , harvey .
i &apos;m sorry .
give me permission to go .
going to work or school ?
both .
think you have time for some of this ?
maybe if you will loan me your limo .
i &apos;m sure we can work something out .
thought you were getting dressed .
i did get dressed .
then you got undressed .
i got a little hot .
yes .
you did .
come to think of it , it is getting a little warm in here .
mr. gillis .
mike ross . nice to meet you .
you should know i &apos;m only doing this
as a courtesy to jonathan sidwell .
but i &apos;ll tell you right now , the answer is no .
good .
why good ?
because a yes is always so much better when it starts as a no .
you &apos;re a confident young man ,
but i know what my distribution centers are worth .
you know what they &apos;re worth to you .
this is what they &apos;re worth to me .
this is bigger than i expected .
i &apos;ve heard that before .
okay , fun time &apos;s over .
i &apos;m not interested in selling to someone
who i don &apos;t know where they &apos;re coming from .
let me tell you where i &apos;m coming from .
i do my homework .
these centers are a beacon to every predator out there
that you haven &apos;t laid the groundwork
to get out of the dvd business .
sounds to me like where you &apos;re coming from is trying to scare me .
no , no , i &apos;m not trying to scare you .
i &apos;m trying to help you .
they &apos;re circling , and you know it .
you don &apos;t do this ,
you might as well send out an invitation
asking for a hostile takeover .
this number can &apos;t be real .
it is .
then what the hell
are you gonna do with my distribution centers ?
i &apos;ll be happy to tell you that five seconds after i buy them .
walter , i know you want your people to be okay ,
and i give you my word they will be .
but these centers ... have become a headache .
and you need cash for when those predators come knocking .
let them knock . i &apos;m not answering the door .
no , you &apos;re not hearing me .
if you don &apos;t raise enough money ,
they &apos;re coming in whether you answer that door or not .
the offer &apos;s good for another hour .
you are not my hair @-@ gelled partner in crime .
i haven &apos;t used hair gel since ninth grade .
i was trying to avoid the frizzy look .
where is he ?
donna said that he had a morning meeting outside of the office .
and where is donna ?
right here .
i prefer to appear at the exact moment i &apos;m needed .
i wish i could say the same for harvey .
oh , well , harvey has a very--
save it .
she may have been born yesterday ,
but i know that morning meeting doesn &apos;t mean &quot; morning meeting . &quot;
everyone knows that .
it &apos;s just not my place to say it .
not mine either .
he did it yesterday too .
when he resurfaces ,
tell specter pearson wants to see him .
i used mousse in high school .
it was the 90s .
was it ?
i heard that .
did you bring me lunch ?
chen dynasty .
how many egg rolls are in here ?
two .
you closed gillis .
no , i killed gillis .
well , i hope you told them no mushrooms in the lo mein .
you never told me that .
i didn &apos;t think i had to .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be the one taking care of me ?
ugh , how am i supposed to do that
when there are mushrooms in my lo mein ?
why do i keep you around again ?
deal memo on friedman technologies ,
engagement letter signed by stillman ,
and , oh , two front @-@ row tickets to daft punk
for you and rachel tonight .
but why do i keep you around ?
mike , sidwell &apos;s in there waiting for you .
be careful , okay ? he &apos;s not in a good mood .
it &apos;s okay . you know why ?
&apos;cause i killed it with gillis .
hey , amy .
yeah ?
eat the mushrooms . they &apos;re good for you .
screw you .
morning .
where have you been ?
oh , you know , just getting walter gillis
to sell us all of his distribution centers .
what the hell are you doing ?
what &apos;s it look like i &apos;m doing ?
i &apos;m sending a message . we &apos;re not a convent .
we &apos;re in business to make money .
and this deal does that .
you did this deal to retain those people &apos;s jobs .
and to make us 30 % .
we &apos;re a hedge fund .
if we don &apos;t make 50 % ,
we might as well buy time @-@ shares and hope for the best .
that &apos;s bullshit . this deal is solid .
no , what &apos;s bullshit is you &apos;ve been here for three months .
all you &apos;ve done is hit singles , and i need a goddamn home run .
jonathan , listen .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
i want you to get your head out of your ass .
stop trying to save people &apos;s jobs ,
and start making us some real money .
or go back to being a lawyer .
i heard you wanted to see me .
that was three hours ago .
if you knew what i was doing three hours ago ,
i don &apos;t think you would &apos;ve wanted to see me .
i know what you were doing three hours ago .
well , then , you should have come on over .
maybe you should try having
some morning meetings yourself .
don &apos;t you worry about my mornings .
what you need to worry about is logan sanders .
what ?
he drive one of his father &apos;s subsidiaries into bankruptcy ?
the opposite . boy got his shit together .
max is retiring , and logan &apos;s taking over .
let me guess . he wants a meeting .
he &apos;s got one .
with you , tomorrow morning , 10 : 00 a.m.
great . push it a week .
harvey , this kid considers himself a young lion .
he &apos;s gonna want to make his mark ,
and the easiest way for him to do that
is to change lawyers .
maybe , but the last thing a lion wants
is to have his dinner handed to him on a silver platter .
you &apos;re gonna give him a hunt .
did you think of that all on your own ?
i &apos;m extra sharp .
i haven &apos;t worked a minute all morning .
see , that &apos;s funny , &apos; cause i was late from all the sex .
get the hell out of my office .
look what the cat dragged in .
and you &apos;re wearing a vest .
here it comes .
here what comes ?
mazel tov .
congratulations on your special day .
that &apos;s a good one .
harvey , leave him alone .
he looks better than you do .
thank you , donna .
you &apos;re welcome .
oh , and mr. peanut called ,
and he said he &apos;d be happy to lend you his top hat .
are you two finished ?
i could go all day .
i think the vest has had enough .
yeah .
so you come all the way down here just to let me know
that you were right about walter gillis ?
i came all the way over here to tell you
i am done playing in the kiddie pool .
i &apos;m listening .
i &apos;m going after a whale .
i think i &apos;m in love . let &apos;s go to war .
that &apos;s the thing .
we &apos;re not going to war .
mike , the second whoever it is finds out
that you &apos;ve got 5 % of their company ,
we &apos;re going to war whether you like it or not .
they &apos;re not gonna find that out because i don &apos;t own 5 % .
do i need to give you a tutorial on the procedure ?
you start by buying shares .
i know what the procedure is , harvey .
well , how many shares have you bought ?
none .
this phrase ,
&quot; i know what the procedure is , &quot;
i don &apos;t think it means what you think it means .
well , as inconceivable as it might be to you , harvey ,
i &apos;m actually not going in hostile .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about approaching someone
to buy their company in order to keep it alive ,
instead of selling it for parts .
you &apos;re offering someone hugs and rainbows .
i &apos;m offering someone the chance to survive
and banking that they &apos;ll take that chance
rather than give up .
you don &apos;t have the money , do you ?
no , i don &apos;t .
but even if i did , i wouldn &apos;t use it .
well , welcome to what every person
who doesn &apos;t have money has ever said .
oh , i get it .
you think this is the meeting where you make fun of my idea .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
this is the meeting where you realize
that my idea is happening whether you like it or not .
where &apos;s the fun in that meeting ?
oh , the fun ?
it &apos;s all right over here on this side of the table .
hey , i &apos;ll give you a chance
to get acquainted with the new reality .
i &apos;ll be in my office .
get back to me by the end of the day .
wow .
looks like our baby boy &apos;s all growns up .
hey , tell me , sweetheart , you guys validate parking ?
oh , yeah , sure thing .
i &apos;ve got it right here .
and how many hours is that good for ?
what &apos;s it matter ? we &apos;re just gonna charge it back to you anyway .
you know my secretary is , like , so much younger
and fitter and funnier than you .
start running .
did he say &quot; fitter &quot; ?
what did you find out ?
woodall &apos;s resurfacing .
me too . when ?
next week .
me too . where ?
s.e.c.
me too . title ?
supervisor .
director .
me too . i just threw that in
to make sure you weren &apos;t yes @-@ man @-@ ing me .
talk to me .
i found out the name of the man woodall &apos;s sending after us .
jeff malone .
jeff malone is a beast .
well , the only way to beat a beast is with a bigger beast .
i need to get in there before everyone else
and let harvey and jessica know that i had the foresight
to look for it , the cunning to find it ,
and the balls to stop it .
then you take on malone .
next stop : name partner .
pearson specter litt .
okay , you know what ?
just let &apos;s not count our chickens before they hatch .
but just for shits and giggles , say it one more time .
leave out specter .
donna , i got paul porter &apos;s annual restructuring proposal .
can you file it under &quot; i don &apos;t give a shit &quot; ?
what about mike ? you want me to have rachel
prepare a dog and pony show for him ?
that won &apos;t be necessary .
why not ?
harvey , i need to talk to you right now
about something very important .
harvey , why won &apos;t it be necessary ?
&apos;cause you don &apos;t beg the girl to go out with you .
you wait .
she &apos;ll call .
that &apos;s not even--
excuse me . hold on a second . um , what if they don &apos;t call ?
they always call .
well , what about people who aren &apos;t you ?
you mean you ?
yeah , of course i do .
if they don &apos;t call , then they don &apos;t call .
but once they smell your desperation ,
they won &apos;t respect you ,
and you &apos;ll never get what you want anyway .
i &apos;m sorry , did you want to talk to me about something ?
it can wait .
come to think of it ,
tell rachel when she &apos;s back from school
she can have the rest of the day off .
harvey .
you do that , you might as well send mike a telegram that says ,
&quot; i &apos;m not putting any thought into your idea . &quot;
yeah , might as well .
okay , are you sure that &apos;s how you want to play this ?
didn &apos;t i just answer that ?
you did , but this isn &apos;t about whether or not mike calls back .
this is about you not letting mike call the shots .
i let him call the shots , all he &apos;s gonna do
is shoot himself in the foot .
maybe .
but if this was anybody other than mike ,
you wouldn &apos;t be acting like this .
bullshit . i don &apos;t let tony gianopolous push me around .
you think i &apos;m gonna let mike ross ?
no , of course you don &apos;t let tony push you around ,
but i &apos;ve never seen you mock one of his ideas .
yeah , because his ideas aren &apos;t ridiculous .
this is mike &apos;s first big idea .
and i just told you , his first big idea sucks .
and if you use rachel to deliver that message ,
this is gonna end badly .
okay , thanks , mom , but i think
i &apos;m gonna keep playing ball in the house .
okay , act like a child who doesn &apos;t want to be told
what to do , but mike &apos;s a client ,
and you need to start treating him like one .
donna , the next time i need help figuring out
how to treat a client , i &apos;ll let you know .
okay , great .
harvey , what can i do for you ?
there &apos;s a jeff malone waiting in the conference room
wanting to see both of us .
any idea who he is ?
i &apos;ve run into him before . he &apos;s a hotshot at the s.e.c.
what do you think he wants ?
let &apos;s go find out .
ms. pearson .
you must be harvey specter .
i &apos;m jeff malone .
i know who you are .
my question is , why are you here ?
you seem hostile .
you investigate
publicly traded companies . we &apos;re not publicly traded .
no , but your clients are .
hence his question and our hostility .
our ?
we tend to stick together
when an uninvited guest interrupts our dinner .
well , i didn &apos;t bring any wine , but when i go ,
i hope you &apos;ll be happy that i dropped by .
yeah , i doubt that .
so why don &apos;t you tell us which client you &apos;re here for
and be on your way ?
all of them .
since when does the s.e.c. go around intimidating law firms
by going after their clients ?
they don &apos;t , but they will
when eric woodall starts there next week .
he comes at our clients after what he did ,
this time , he won &apos;t get fired , he &apos;ll end up in jail .
except it won &apos;t be woodall who &apos;s coming .
it &apos;ll be him .
exactly .
listen , i &apos;m gonna be getting a vaguely worded assignment
with a not @-@ so @-@ vague agenda
of getting up your clients &apos; asses with the full power of the s.e.c.
and when they ask why--
and they always ask why--
i &apos;m gonna be expected to tell them
that it &apos;s because they &apos;re clients of your firm .
why are you telling us this ?
because he doesn &apos;t want to work for woodall .
he wants to work here .
i &apos;ve always heard how good you were .
it &apos;s nice to see it &apos;s true .
anyway , here &apos;s the thing .
i &apos;m really tired of being a public servant ,
and more importantly ,
i &apos;ve always thought that eric woodall was a ...
oh , shit , i &apos;ll just go ahead and say it .
he &apos;s a dick .
finally , something we can agree on .
seems to me the only thing left for us to agree on , harvey ,
is my starting salary .
i &apos;m just kidding .
i &apos;m sure all your new senior partners get paid the same .
before you start picking out floor patterns for your new office ,
i &apos;d like to discuss this with my partner first .
i &apos;d expect nothing less .
oh , uh , just one more thing .
i haven &apos;t been formally given this assignment yet , so i have no conflict .
but in one more week i will ,
which means this offer will be gone .
is that a threat ?
i would never threaten someone that i want to be in business with , jessica .
it &apos;s just the truth .
i like him .
how did it go with harvey ?
it didn &apos;t .
what do you mean &quot; it didn &apos;t &quot; ?
you &apos;re the only man here who can take on jeff malone .
how could he not see that ?
i didn &apos;t bring it up .
louis , winter is coming .
i know , and i &apos;m the night &apos;s watch .
but right now we need to be patient .
patience is not your strong suit .
well , today it is .
because if there &apos;s one thing that i &apos;ve always known ,
it &apos;s that you do not call the pretty girl .
you wait for her to call you .
louis , i &apos;m seeing someone .
i &apos;m happy for you ,
though i have no idea why you &apos;re saying that right now .
katrina , trust me .
they &apos;re gonna find out about jeff malone soon enough
&apos;cause he &apos;s gonna come calling .
and when he does , they &apos;re gonna come right over to me .
like him all you want . i &apos;m not hiring him .
why not ?
why do you think ?
because you don &apos;t like making decisions staring down the barrel of a shotgun .
jessica pearson . nice to meet you .
jessica , the man walked in here and offered to fight for us .
if it &apos;s not him , who &apos;s it gonna be ?
the guy in the office next door .
louis ?
harvey , louis knows everything there is to know about the s.e.c.
he &apos;s damn good , and you know it .
this guy isn &apos;t damn good . he &apos;s a killer .
and he &apos;s a prosecutor . we need a defender .
if i &apos;m in a dark alley ,
i &apos;d take the killer over the defender seven days a week .
and eric woodall &apos;s gonna put us in a dark alley .
louis is a known quantity .
and right now jeff malone &apos;s biggest selling point
is telling us that woodall is coming .
louis sure as hell didn &apos;t ,
which means he either didn &apos;t know
or he wasn &apos;t man enough to come in here
and take the job for himself .
harvey , do you know why i don &apos;t like
being strong @-@ armed into decisions ?
because i &apos;ll never be able to trust the person who did it .
then figure out a way to get someone as good .
or hire this guy and come to terms with it .
because if it &apos;s louis against malone in a street fight ,
i &apos;m picking that dude .
oh , thank you .
hey , how &apos;d your meeting go with the mysterious harvey specter ?
being a dick doesn &apos;t make him mysterious .
well , then i guess you &apos;re an open book .
you know , i was gonna give you those daft punk tickets ,
but now after that , i think i &apos;ll give them to edna .
okay , first of all , edna was 63 when daft punk was born .
really ? with that skin ?
you know what , i worked hard to get you those things .
why aren &apos;t you going ?
i dropped the hammer on harvey ,
which means rachel &apos;s gonna be working all night .
hey , what are you doing here ?
donna texted me when i was at columbia ...
and told me that harvey gave me the rest of the day off
because i &apos;m kicking ass .
he &apos;s giving you the rest of the day off ?
mm @-@ hmm , so i figured
we could celebrate over dinner before the concert .
what , are you jealous &apos; cause he never did that for you ?
um , no . that &apos;s great .
you pick a place . i &apos;ll meet you there .
i got to set up some meetings for tomorrow first .
what about the little owl ?
yeah .
okay .
mike , what are you doing here ?
you delivered a message , so now i &apos;m delivering one .
pearson specter is formally in review .
what did you just say to me ?
you want my business , you &apos;re gonna have to earn it .
i have earned it .
by sh---ing on my plan ?
you don &apos;t have a plan .
you &apos;re running into a wall .
it &apos;s not my job to crash into it with you .
crash into it ?
you didn &apos;t even ask me who i &apos;m going after .
i didn &apos;t have to because it doesn &apos;t matter .
but go ahead . who is it ?
gillis industries .
that &apos;s not a whale . that &apos;s a monster .
a man like walter gillis
isn &apos;t gonna listen to a guy like you
offering to save him with sunshine and rainbows .
that &apos;s exactly what you said to me
before i got him to sell me his distribution centers .
congratulations . you got to walk his dog .
that doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s gonna let you marry his daughter .
listen to me . you want to be my guy ?
you stop telling me why i can &apos;t do this ,
and you start figuring out how i can .
i already told you how you can .
you get some money , start buying some shares ,
and you walk in there with a club
and the balls to use it if you have to .
harvey , when i told you my plan &apos;s happening
whether you like it or not , i meant it .
i &apos;m interviewing law firms tomorrow .
you show up with a better attitude and another move ,
or you just lost a client .
so you wanna talk about it ?
talk about what ?
about whatever &apos;s going on with you and harvey .
why does everybody think that i was born yesterday ?
i tell you that he gives me the rest of the day off work ,
you vanish until dinner ,
and then you &apos;re pissed off for the rest of the night ,
so it doesn &apos;t take a rocket scientist .
clearly .
i meant &quot; i love you . &quot;
mm @-@ hmm , nice recovery .
doesn &apos;t get you out of answering my question .
you really want to know ?
i &apos;ll tell you .
harvey was michael jordan .
now it &apos;s lebron &apos;s time ,
and he can &apos;t take it .
that &apos;s a pretty big accusation to make .
well , there &apos;s more to the story than you know .
what ?
right , so come on .
i said i didn &apos;t want to get between you two .
what ?
let &apos;s just say that you kicking ass for him
isn &apos;t the reason you got the day off .
i thought you had law school today .
i do right after this .
he told you .
did you think he wouldn &apos;t ?
look , if you want to send a message to mike ,
go right ahead .
if you want me to send a message to mike ,
tell me when and where , but ...
please don &apos;t ever use me like that again .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m what now ?
i shouldn &apos;t have done that . i &apos;m sorry .
is it april fools &apos; day ?
no , but don &apos;t ever let it be said
that i can &apos;t admit when i &apos;m wrong .
then i will stop saying that .
didn &apos;t you say you have class today ?
i &apos;m on my way .
what was that all about ?
just some administrative stuff .
administrative stuff . you and rachel .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
you mean how i said would happen happened
and now you realize i was right the whole time ?
no one likes a gloater , donna .
well , then i guess
the harvey specter university of gloating
is gonna have to shut down .
i can still give lectures on the weekend .
you want to hear it ?
you were right .
call ray .
i &apos;m gonna go let mike know i &apos;m his lawyer .
you &apos;re gonna push a meeting with me ?
harvey , logan sanders is here to see you .
first of all , i don &apos;t appreciate
you stomping into my office with an attitude .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t appreciate being put off ,
especially when i know that you never pushed a meeting
with my father .
your father never went to jessica to set a meeting with me .
then i assume that next time i call you directly ,
you &apos;ll pick up the phone .
logan , let me give the abcs of me .
i don &apos;t take meetings . i set them .
and my respect isn &apos;t demanded . it &apos;s earned .
that &apos;s only two things . what &apos;s &quot; c &quot; ?
&quot; c &quot; is for people who show me they know &quot; a &quot; and &quot; b. &quot;
well , since we &apos;re quoting jerry maguire ,
all i want is for you to show me the money .
you just took step number one towards earning my respect .
and i dig that about you .
great .
would it be too much trouble for me to discuss my business now ?
well , i was gonna move on to crimson tide ,
but , yeah , go ahead .
knock yourself out .
you ever hear of a family called the winwards ?
no . should i ?
in 1950 , they were worth the equivalent of a billion dollars .
by 1988 , one of them owned a couple of dry cleaners .
and it didn &apos;t happen because they squandered it .
it happened because they stayed a dinosaur .
you don &apos;t want to become a dinosaur .
no .
i like to think of myself as a shark .
keep moving forward or die .
you &apos;re talking hostile takeover .
you think i &apos;d be here if i wasn &apos;t ?
you just took step number two towards earning my respect .
what &apos;s the company ?
gillis industries , and i already own 4.9 % .
logan , we have to end this conversation right now .
what are you talking about ?
i thought i just earned your respect .
you did , but we have a conflict .
what do you mean , you have a conflict ?
i mean we have a conflict .
what are you gonna do about it ?
i &apos;m gonna go and resolve it .
well , you better do it fast , because i am in on this .
and that means you &apos;re either with me or against me .
that includes all $ 1 billion of my business .
hey . prunie ?
what is that ?
it &apos;s a prune smoothie .
i invented it myself .
rain check .
louis , guess who stopped by yesterday
for an impromptu meeting with jessica and harvey .
please tell me it was dick cheney .
why would you want it to be dick cheney ?
why wouldn &apos;t i want it to be iron dick ?
holy sh-- , i think i know who you were talking about .
i think you do too .
is it a certain s.e.c. beast
whose name happens to rhyme with schmeff schmalone ?
schmess it is , and schmess it does .
well , schmuck me .
louis , we have a problem .
what &apos;s the problem ? as if i didn &apos;t know .
i just got out of a meeting with logan sanders .
logan sanders ?
this isn &apos;t about ...
about what ?
the--n @-@ never mind .
what &apos;s the problem ?
he wants to go after the same company
that mike pitched me first .
so what &apos;s the problem ? mike brought it to you first .
you &apos;re obligated to stick with him .
the problem is mike formally put us in review .
holy sh-- . that &apos;s why you &apos;re coming to me .
you &apos;re gonna lose mike ,
and you want to know if there &apos;s any way around it ?
is there ?
no , harvey .
i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re gonna have to drop mike .
what happened with harvey ?
nothing .
he had an emergency with mike .
fine , but don &apos;t you think now is the time to act for yourself ?
no , we have a good plan , and we &apos;re sticking to it .
they &apos;re stewing on malone , and the more they stew--
the more leverage we have .
name partner .
and as i &apos;ve said , all we need to do is be patient .
well , patience may be one of your virtues ,
but it is not one of mine .
i didn &apos;t want to jinx it .
you didn &apos;t .
katrina , this is one of the sweetest things
anyone &apos;s ever done for me .
i want to make sure you don &apos;t waste your opportunity to get this .
i promise i won &apos;t .
what are you doing here ?
we shouldn &apos;t be seen together .
you had no problem walking into my place of business .
why should i have a problem walking into yours ?
because unless you &apos;re here to tell me that i have the job ,
then you &apos;re putting my position here in jeopardy .
how do you think i felt
when i found the man that i &apos;m sleeping with
standing in my conference room ?
jessica , will you please lower your voice ?
not only that , but you stood there
with a sh---eating grin on your face
and tried to strong @-@ arm me into giving you a job .
are you as turned on as i am right now ?
you &apos;re not funny .
why didn &apos;t you come to me first with this ?
because if i had come to you with this first ,
you would have thought i was trading on our relationship .
aren &apos;t you ?
no .
and if we weren &apos;t together ,
i would have gone to both of you , all right ?
so i went to both of you .
now it may not have been perfect , but ...
there was no perfect way of doing it ,
unless i hadn &apos;t done it .
now that sounds pretty perfect to me .
what are you so afraid of ?
do i have to draw you a picture ?
i &apos;m not the one that made up the saying
&quot; you don &apos;t shit where you eat . &quot;
am i the shit or the food in this little painting of yours ?
because if we &apos;re just a fling ,
then what difference does it make
whether i work with you or not ?
i didn &apos;t say we &apos;re just a fling .
then if there really is a chance for us ,
then why not go for both ?
because i &apos;ve seen what happens when things go south
between partners ,
and i &apos;m not willing to put my business in jeopardy .
your business .
yes , my business .
the one that i have fought tooth and nail to keep together ,
the same business that you strolled into with a shotgun
and said , &quot; marry me , or i &apos;ll start shooting . &quot;
jess , if you want me to apologize
for the way that i asked , then i will .
but i don &apos;t ask for things that i don &apos;t want .
and what i want is to work at pearson specter
and to keep seeing you .
those two things are not both gonna happen .
then i guess you have to decide
what &apos;s more important to you--
what we have or what you have .
hey , mike .
there &apos;s another prospect here to see you ,
but he &apos;s late , and his tie &apos;s too fat .
should i let him in ?
you tell her to say all that garbage ?
he didn &apos;t need to , johnnie fat tie .
yeah , i guess i have time for one more meeting .
mike , i need to talk to you .
although , i &apos;m sorry , sir .
you &apos;ve missed the pastries . i can call you some up .
listen to me .
i came down here because i wanted to tell you
if you want to run through this wall ,
i &apos;m ready to run through it with you .
good .
but i can &apos;t .
what ?
what i can do is tell you
i &apos;m ready to run through another one .
what the hell are you talking about ?
we have a conflict .
bullshit .
who is it ?
it &apos;s not bullshit .
then who is it ?
you know i can &apos;t tell you that .
no , what i know is that it &apos;s very convenient
that you suddenly have a conflict
the day after you tell me that my idea isn &apos;t good enough .
i don &apos;t find it convenient at all ,
but you put us in review ,
and now i have to go with the other client .
i put you in review because you refused to get on board .
and i just told you ,
i want to run through another wall with you ,
and we still can if you drop this .
and why should i be the one to drop it ?
because they &apos;re not going to , and i have to stick with them .
and i &apos;m telling you , you &apos;re gonna lose .
what , because you &apos;re on the other side ?
because their plan is better .
says the professional bullshitter
who has a brand @-@ new vested interest in me bowing out .
i &apos;m gonna let that go .
but if you don &apos;t let this go ,
i can &apos;t represent you on anything until it &apos;s over .
then i guess we &apos;re done here .
you cook ?
you come home to this in your kitchen ,
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to ask me ?
well , i was gonna ask you
how the hell you got into my apartment ,
but i knew you weren &apos;t gonna tell me .
do you remember when you told me
i should think about taking some morning meetings ?
i can &apos;t say that it &apos;s never crossed my mind ,
but you really think it &apos;s a good idea--
jeff malone .
well , he &apos;s not my type .
you gotta be kidding me .
why didn &apos;t you tell me yesterday ?
because i wasn &apos;t gonna hire him yesterday ,
so it was none of your business .
but today i might , so now it is .
and you want to know how i feel about it .
you &apos;re my partner .
well , i already told you how i feel about hiring him .
this doesn &apos;t change that .
good to know .
seems like something else is on your mind .
he doesn &apos;t just want to work together .
he wants us to keep seeing each other .
and you don &apos;t want to risk the one to have the other .
no . i don &apos;t .
i &apos;ve been there .
i know .
then you need to figure out which is more important .
i guess i do .
so you two have , um ...
yes .
so he &apos;s seen you naked ?
that &apos;s usually how these things work .
are you picturing me naked right now ?
maybe .
yes .
go wash your hands .
don &apos;t spend too much time in that bathroom .
let me get this straight .
you come to me with a killer idea ,
and all of a sudden you don &apos;t want to do it anymore
&apos;cause you lost your bff ?
i don &apos;t want to do it because it &apos;s not a killer idea anymore .
why the hell not ?
because harvey has a conflict ,
which means somebody already has a dog in the fight .
who gives a shit ?
i do .
&apos;cause whoever it is is already buying shares .
you didn &apos;t come in here to give up .
you came in here to get my money .
you &apos;re damn right i did .
i give you my money , now i have downside .
jonathan , look .
you said you wanted a home run .
you gotta pull out your checkbook ,
&apos;cause i can &apos;t compete without it .
you could yesterday .
now it &apos;s today .
and you &apos;re still going in there
another banker in a suit ,
hoping he &apos;ll trust you based on nothing .
i &apos;ve got more than nothing .
what the hell are you talking about ?
trust me .
i did my homework .
batter up .
what are you doing here ?
i said i &apos;d tell you what we were gonna do with your centers
five seconds after we closed .
when did we close ?
about three seconds ago .
i guess we better hurry .
all right , what &apos;s going to happen to my employees ?
we &apos;re going to sell your distribution centers
to a pharmaceutical company
as distribution centers .
they use your workers .
they hit the ground running . win @-@ win .
you &apos;re a man of your word .
but that &apos;s not why you &apos;re here .
no , it isn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not interested in selling my business .
i know that , because i know
why you &apos;ve thrown your whole life into this company
and why you chose the movie business in the first place .
what &apos;s your point ?
phillip .
your son .
you loved watching movies together .
that &apos;s why you started this company
and why you won &apos;t let go of what it &apos;s become
for any amount of money .
how do you know that ?
i told you .
i do my homework .
you lost him ,
and you needed an outlet ,
and that &apos;s what this company is to you now--
your family .
i told you , i &apos;m not selling .
and i told you , they &apos;re coming after you
whether you like it or not .
and the difference between me and them
is they want to tear your company apart ,
and i want to keep it together .
you don &apos;t have the resources to do that .
yes .
i do .
as of an hour ago , i started investing .
so by this time next week , i will own 4.9 % .
i didn &apos;t have to tell you that .
and that &apos;s supposed to make me trust you ?
i lost both of my parents when i was 11 years old ,
so i know a little something about needing family .
walter ...
i can &apos;t guarantee you we &apos;ll win ,
but i can guarantee you that i will never sell you out .
all right , i &apos;m in .
listen , zane , i want that goddamn filing
on my desk nine seconds ago ,
or you can forget you ever worked here .
now excuse me .
i &apos;ve got to go be a dick to someone .
sit down .
is this about you and mike ?
listen to me-- this is gonna be a street fight ,
and there &apos;s only gonna be one man standing when it &apos;s over .
so i &apos;m only gonna ask you this once .
you don &apos;t need to .
i don &apos;t want out . i want in .
and when i said , &quot; you want me to send a message to mike ? &quot;
i meant it .
i was just gonna ask if you were comfortable
getting me coffee in the mornings .
i &apos;m serious .
i didn &apos;t back down from a fight with my dad ,
and i &apos;m not going to back down from one with mike .
good .
now , i actually am gonna get coffee .
great . one sugar , a splash of cream ,
and don &apos;t skimp on the hazelnut .
too soon .
instead of failing to be charming ,
why don &apos;t you do something useful
and get moving on drawing up a tender offer for logan sanders ?
logan ? no , you mean max sanders .
i keep forgetting that you &apos;re in law school half the time .
max is retired .
it &apos;s logan &apos;s show now .
you wanted to see me ?
we need to move up our timeline .
well , i &apos;m buying shares as fast as i can .
i &apos;m talking about a tender offer .
the plan is shock and awe .
if we rush a tender offer ,
we won &apos;t have enough leverage
to force people to vote with us .
it &apos;s fine to have shock and awe
when you &apos;re the only one in the game ,
but walter gillis knows we &apos;re coming ,
and he got himself an ally .
how do you know that ?
because i do .
your conflict-- who is it ?
i can &apos;t talk about it .
well , when the hell can you ?
in another hour .
you have it for me ?
harvey , you know you can still get out of this if you want to .
mike &apos;s not gonna sign that thing if you tell him not to .
it &apos;s too late for that .
oh , my god .
hey , just the woman i wanted to see .
donna , would you happen to have the measurements
to hardman &apos;s old office ?
louis , get out of my way .
whoa . what &apos;s going on , donna ?
what &apos;s going on ?
that bullshit harvey told you
about waiting for the girl to call ,
it &apos;s bullshit .
he waited , and now it &apos;s too late .
change of plans . cancel anything you have .
we &apos;re staying here all night .
what for ?
the s.e.c. &apos; s coming ,
jessica &apos;s hiring one person to fight &apos; em ,
and first thing tomorrow ,
we need to convince her that person &apos;s me .
i see you have the movies .
i guess that means you &apos;ve decided
which relationship you want us to have .
i have .
but it &apos;s not what you might think .
if you still want the job ,
it starts tomorrow .
i do .
then tonight is our last night .
we &apos;ll see if you still think that in four hours .
oh , you want to go three times ?
oh , i was including one of the movies .
no .
no .
finally got yourself an office .
maybe you forgot , but i had an office before .
i just gave it back .
i remember , as a show of loyalty .
yeah , well , that was then . this is now .
what you got there , harvey ?
you think you could meet with walter gillis
and i wouldn &apos;t find out ?
no , i knew you &apos;d find out .
i just didn &apos;t care .
then maybe you won &apos;t mind signing this .
let me guess .
you want me to waive the conflict that you still have
after hearing my plan first .
i sure didn &apos;t come here to see your shitty office .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be nice
to the person you need something from ?
they &apos;re still coming whether you sign it or not .
if i don &apos;t sign it , they won &apos;t be coming with you .
true .
of course , if you don &apos;t sign it ,
it may cause some people to say you &apos;re afraid of me .
and by &quot; some people , &quot; i mean me .
of course , if i sign it just because you said that ,
then it might cause some people to say you baited me .
but i knew you were coming
the second i went to see walter gillis .
so ...
i went ahead and signed one for you .
i guess it &apos;s on .
i guess it is .
you think we need to lay out some ground rules ?
rules ? in a knife fight ?
i guess somebody ought to yell , &quot; one , two , three , go . &quot;
one , two , three , go .
you know , usually when someone gets a new office ,
you &apos;re supposed to bring them something , right ?
like an orchid or something ?
no ?
nothing ?
you signed the waiver , didn &apos;t you ?
you know i did .
not gonna back down from harvey .
and i suppose you got gillis on board with your plan ?
i wouldn &apos;t have needed to sign the waiver if i didn &apos;t .
hey , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
this thing between me and harvey--
it doesn &apos;t have to affect us .
we won &apos;t let it .
i didn &apos;t know that logan sanders
took over his father &apos;s company until today .
what does that have to do with anything ?
he &apos;s harvey &apos;s client .
yeah , so ?
do you remember when i told you that i ...
that i once had an affair with a married man ?
it was him .
