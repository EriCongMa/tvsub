well ... see you after the break .
what are you all doing for thanksgiving ?
i &apos;m having andre &apos;s whole family over , though he &apos;ll be
stuck working at the stereo store for black friday .
oh , sure , you get to say that ,
but we &apos;re stuck calling it &quot; jew friday . &quot;
ugh , i &apos;ll be with my family , fielding the same old questions .
&quot; how &apos;s community college ? &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s your major ? &quot;
&quot; are those real ? &quot;
my aunt &apos;s boyfriend .
&quot; oh , my family &apos;s a normal religion ,
&quot; so i have to talk to them for five minutes
before i get a casserole that &apos;s all marshmallow . &quot;
that &apos;s you .
brainstorm .
why don &apos;t you all come over to my house ?
i &apos;ll have plenty of food .
that would be great .
marshmallows .
sounds good to me .
i was going to microwave buttered noodles ,
but this sounds equally promising .
i &apos;m in .
oh , goody .
well , you know , you &apos;re all welcome , of course .
i &apos;m in .
or , you know , jeff or whoever .
can &apos;t . plans .
well , if you change your mind ,
i can &apos;t think of anyone who would enjoy having you more .
how @-@ dean , pilgrims .
is that ...
john wayne , yes .
oh , good , you got it .
anyhoo , i just thought i &apos;d mosey on over here ,
invite you all to greendale &apos;s
annual thanks @-@ living potluck dinner ,
where we remember all we have to be thankful for .
there may be a statistical link to
enrollment at greendale and holiday suicide .
just a shoelace-
and belt @-@ free night full of fun .
you should all drop by .
or jeff . or whoever .
oh , he can &apos;t . he has plans .
oh , right ,
you are spending thanksgiving with your father .
i thought i told you to stop reading my email .
yeah , well , i thought i told you to stop keeping secrets .
how am i supposed to keep track
of what you tell me in confidence
and what i hear through your walls
with a glass to my ear ?
fine . close your mouths .
i &apos;m having thanksgiving with my estranged father .
can we move on now ?
makes sense .
jeff &apos;s at a point in his life
where he needs a strong father figure to come out to .
jeff , this is huge news .
huger news .
was this decision made after our halloween conversation ?
yes , after . not because of .
i &apos;ll take it .
you had that teed up ?
when i say &quot; thera , &quot; you say &quot; pist . &quot;
thera--
pist .
thera--
thanks for the support , guys .
oh , the support has just begun .
what do you want me to bring to papa winger &apos;s house ,
some vegan pumpkin pie ?
britta , you &apos;re not coming .
fine , regular pumpkin pie .
jeff , you &apos;re going to need me
when things get messy and emotional .
the only thing that &apos;s going to get messy and emotional
is troy , when he realizes there are yams
underneath those marshmallows .
i knew it was too good to be true .
jeff , speaking not just as your friend
but as an avid daytime tv watcher ,
these parent @-@ child reunions can get intense .
chairs might be thrown .
weaves might be pulled .
or i could just go in there ,
show him how awesome i am , no thanks to him ,
meet my half @-@ brother ...
and then , boom . closure .
your dad has another son ?
yeah . so , clearly , he &apos;s moved on .
why can &apos;t i ? close your mouths .
look , i appreciate your concern ,
but really , the most helpful thing you can do
is stay out of my business .
oh , can you say that last part again ?
these walls are entirely too thick .
第四季第五集
oh ! happy thanksgiving , everyone .
let &apos;s carve that jive turkey !
got that out of your system ?
yeah .
then i &apos;m so happy to welcome you all to my home .
oh , thank you .
hello , come in .
take your coats off . make yourself comfortable .
browse the available literature
about jesus christ as your personal savior .
or not . no agenda .
are you going to pass some apps soon ,
or do i have to die of starvation to prove a point ?
oh , everybody ,
this is mr. bennett , my father @-@ in @-@ law .
dad , these are my friends from college .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s andre &apos;s people .
they &apos;re a bunch of characters .
that &apos;s a good one , dad .
oh , i brought something .
dip .
oh , abed , why is this seven layer dip so puffy ?
oh , it &apos;s been in the fridge for two years .
i was saving it for a special occasion .
oh , that &apos;s so thoughtful .
i &apos;m going to put this on a nice platter
with some crackers in the trash .
where &apos;s britta ?
hey , jeff . what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s up is closure .
i met my dad , we talked things out as men .
i think i &apos;m ready to move on .
really , in 20 minutes ?
fine . look , i couldn &apos;t do it .
i was at the front door , totally in control ,
and then i started thinking about all that stuff
you said about messiness ,
and it threw me off my game .
you know , the irony is ,
after all your pestering that i deal with my daddy issues ,
you &apos;re the reason i &apos;m not meeting my father .
or maybe i &apos;m the reason you &apos;ll come here after all .
britta , i--
wait . what do you mean by &quot; here &quot; ?
your dad &apos;s house ,
where i kind of , sort of , am .
yeah , thanks , sharon .
i never thought about it that way .
batman is sort of gay .
be right back .
what is going on ?
why is thanksgiving so terrible ?
i know .
the tension , the backbiting , the judgmental comments .
this makes thanksgiving with my family look--
eh , still pretty bad .
i said batman was gay .
you ask one lady if she &apos;s tyler perry in drag ,
and suddenly , you &apos;re the bad guy .
it &apos;s a reference . that &apos;s my humor .
abed gets it .
oh , you &apos;re all hiding out in here .
we &apos;re not hiding . you know us , kind of get away .
well , be careful .
you might be giving the impression
that you prefer the cold garage
to the warm heart of my hospitality .
what ? as if .
okay . well , hurry back soon .
this is the jonestown of dinners .
i feel like i &apos;m in jail .
and you know what happens to guys like me in jail .
they get really into push @-@ ups ,
and i am fine with my upper body the way it is !
it did feel like a prison ,
and that meant only one thing made sense , conceptually .
we had to break out .
and someone with the gravitas of morgan freeman
had to narrate it .
we need to do a prison break .
happy thanksgiving ?
you really &quot; you &apos;d &quot; this one , huh ?
okay , yes , i meddled against your wishes ,
and yes , i got this address from the dean ,
but hey .
you had a moment of doubt ,
and here i am to help you through it .
psychology tells us there are no accidents .
oh , really ?
what about car accidents , tara reid ,
or the hindenburg ?
here goes nothing .
hello , william .
so , uh how about we make some ground rules ?
actually , that sounds good .
okay . no hugs .
wouldn &apos;t want one . no apologies .
wouldn &apos;t accept one . no calling you &quot; dad . &quot;
no expectations .
no bs .
drink ?
scotch .
18 ?
neat .
i just want to acknowledge
that there are a lot of emotions flowing right now ,
and you two are probably feeling a strong impulse
to sleep with each other ,
and hey , that &apos;s normal .
i &apos;ll get the drinks .
so , how about that ? no muss , no fuss .
jeff , i urge you not to run from the muss and fuss .
you must be my half @-@ brother .
oh , your hands are so much bigger than mine .
your nail beds are perfect .
i can &apos;t do it . i can &apos;t .
oh , god .
oh , it &apos;s coming up .
when i get upset , i vomit .
oh , i see you &apos;ve met willy junior .
you said he wasn &apos;t going to replace me .
he &apos;s the schwarzenegger . i &apos;m the devito .
i get it .
okay , fellas , let &apos;s get right into it .
i think the big question on everyone &apos;s mind is
why don &apos;t i go help willy junior ? hmm ?
one thing was clear to me and the rest of the crew .
bennett lockup was not where we belonged .
we belonged in the sun , with the wind in our hair ,
or maybe at a bennigan &apos;s , enjoying a turkey o &apos;toole .
we should tunnel out .
abed , shirley is our friend ,
and we &apos;re guests in her home .
we need a plan that won &apos;t hurt her feelings ,
or damage her property .
definitely don &apos;t look behind that poster , then .
i could pretend to have a stroke .
do a gibberish foreign language .
what if i did a gibberish foreign language like star wars ?
you &apos;d like that , i bet . dick .
look , i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll figure out a way out of here .
what &apos;s important right now is that we stick together .
yeah . oh , there you are .
who wants a pre @-@ dinner snack ?
oh , pumpkin , what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , it &apos;s too embarrassing
to talk about in front of the guys ,
know what i mean , girlfriend ?
oh , sweetie .
do you have your monthly shame ?
do you want to lie down in elijah &apos;s room ?
oh , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to cut it .
i probably need to go home and call dr. collins .
it &apos;s that bad .
oh , well , you know ,
my sister @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s a gynecologist ,
and she &apos;s right in the other room .
there &apos;s no need to bother your doctor on a holiday .
go ahead . mm @-@ hmm .
i &apos;d like to tell you annie avoided
shirley &apos;s doctor sister @-@ in @-@ law ,
but this ain &apos;t no fairy tale .
this is thanksgiving .
let &apos;s see , what else ?
you &apos;ve got some diabetes , on my mother &apos;s side .
good to know .
i like your hair .
the presence of it , i mean .
so i have a question ,
and it &apos;s been weighing on me pretty heavily .
at your age , in the bedroom--
oh , yeah . it &apos;s all good .
yeah ? real good .
look at them . bonding .
probably laughing &apos; cause i can &apos;t grow a beard .
i have an idea .
why don &apos;t we use these dinner rolls
to do some &quot; roll &quot; play ?
i see what i did there .
okay .
this roll , this is me .
he &apos;s crying .
good . that &apos;s really good .
so , uh , what do you do ?
i &apos;m a lawyer who faked a bachelor &apos;s degree
and practiced law for seven years
before i got caught .
i like your hustle .
reminds me of the summer i was ralph lauren
out in st. tropez .
&apos;83 , i &apos;m on a boat with , uh--
damn it , willy !
i &apos;m expressing .
knock it off .
why can &apos;t you just swallow it , like any normal person ?
oh ! oh , right . like your new son .
like mister @-@ mister i &apos;ve got my shirt--
i don &apos;t know a lot of personal details about you yet .
well , my name &apos;s jeff .
don &apos;t help me , mister helper guy .
first mom dies , now this ?
hey , she died 20 years ago , willy .
he keeps singing the same old song .
wow . she died on you .
here i thought you &apos;d become father of the year ,
but you just got stuck .
yeah , well , look , i don &apos;t have to tell you
i &apos;m not a natural caretaker ,
but with willy , you know , i @-@ i checked all the boxes ,
and he still turned out softer than wet cheese .
i don &apos;t get it .
he keeps saying he &apos;s going to move out next week ,
since &apos; 03 .
oh , man , i couldn &apos;t wait to get out .
i got my own place when i was 18 .
i was the same way .
so who &apos;s ready to eat ?
jeff , you care to carve the turkey ?
i knew it !
you love him more than me .
i &apos;ll show you . i &apos;ll run away .
oh , please . hey , be my guest .
you run away , and i &apos;m going to sleep like a baby tonight .
oh , now , i &apos;m sorry you guys had to see that ,
but maybe you could shrink his head ,
since you &apos;re here for some reason .
yes . i can do this .
show me on the dinner roll where you &apos;re hurt !
and that &apos;s how it went for the afternoon .
this tag team turkey day became our routine .
we endured the indignities as best we could .
cousins fighting , complaints about the food ,
listening to a nephew do borat for a full hour .
listening to a nephew do borat for a full hour .
we figured out ways to steal away from time to time ,
saying we had to pee , had to get ice ,
had to do a jewish thing in the other room .
i became known as the guy who could get you things .
piece of gum , playing cards ,
some novelty glasses i found in a box marked &quot; crap . &quot;
in those brief , tranquil moments , we felt human .
we felt free .
but sooner or later , our warden would come knocking .
mostly , we just waited for our time to be served ,
but some didn &apos;t take kindly to waiting .
some didn &apos;t have much time left .
enough . amateur hour is over .
i &apos;m going in there , pretend to break a hip ,
and we &apos;ll be sipping sambuca at skeepers in no time .
whoa . he tripped on the rug .
wait , now he &apos;s getting up .
he &apos;s walking around dazed like he &apos;s got a head injury .
oh , groin into the corner of the table .
this might actually work .
wait , wait , why are people laughing ?
let &apos;s see , i need a broom , a rake , or two rakes--
pierce , you were supposed to pretend to injure yourself
so we could leave .
leave ?
this is my showtime at the apollo .
i &apos;m killing out there .
pierce was our last hope , or so we thought .
it seemed troy barnes had a plan .
what if we got sick ?
no . no more faking illnesses .
not fake sick . real sick .
and that &apos;s when i told my old firm to shove it .
i &apos;ve always been more of a free agent , anyway .
yeah , i can see that about you .
you seem like a self @-@ made man .
well , i kind of had to be .
look , if it &apos;s okay with you , i &apos;d like to break a rule .
i know we said &quot; no mushy stuff , &quot;
but for what it &apos;s worth , i &apos;m proud of you .
thanks .
makes you think .
wait , what do you mean ?
well , look , i mean , you &apos;ve seen how willy turned out .
i mean , i haven &apos;t done that kid any favors .
and so i look at you ,
so self @-@ reliant and well @-@ adjusted ,
and i think maybe i did something right .
you did something right ?
well , let me say that different .
uh , the universe is a constantly expanding--
stop .
i get the impulse , but that &apos;s not going to work here .
no , i just mean that , uh ,
we are defined by what happens to us ,
and me leaving seems to have made you independent ,
made you strong .
with all due respect , which is none ,
go to hell .
so tunneling out is off the table ?
who &apos;s hungry for turkey ?
shirley , we were just--
about to--
eat garbage dip .
why did i have to go third ?
look , i get it . you want to leave .
shirley , we &apos;re sorry .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
to be honest , i invited you as a bit of a buffer .
with andre &apos;s family , i &apos;m always the butt of the joke ,
and with andre gone this year ,
i thought i could tip the scales in my favor
by having a few friends around .
that was wrong of me .
see you monday .
i can &apos;t believe none of us noticed
she was having such a hard time .
we can &apos;t leave .
funny thing about prison .
sometimes the person you thought was your warden
turns out to be a fellow prisoner ,
which doesn &apos;t really line up
with the whole shawshank thing ,
but maybe we &apos;ve always been doing
more of a prison break .
the show .
whoa , what are you doing in my car ? !
take me with you .
teach me what you know .
what in the cat &apos;s cradle is happening ?
dad hates me .
what do you care what that guy thinks ?
he &apos;s a dick .
see , that &apos;s what i need to learn !
how to be all dead inside with muscles on top ,
not all emotional and flabby .
yeah , but you are emotional .
and if you pretend you &apos;re not ,
you &apos;re only letting him off the hook
for being a terrible father ,
which he is and always has been .
i mean , he meant the world to you ,
and you meant nothing to him .
and if you run away now , he &apos;ll never know .
he should know .
britta &apos;s the worst .
ow ! jeez .
oh . i thought you guys left .
we started as your buffer ,
but we &apos;re busting you out of here now .
i drew a map of your house on my stomach .
uh , i know what my house looks like .
that &apos;s what i said .
look , if we act fast , we can get through this plan ,
which is to put you in the trash can ,
take you out like trash ,
but we got to dress you like a baby .
thank you so much for doing this ,
but i &apos;m not going anywhere .
those people up there , they may be rude , they may be pushy ,
they may have come to some wrongheaded conclusions
about batman and robin ...
oh , thank you .
but they &apos;re my family ,
and family means putting up with each other
even when it &apos;s hard .
you guys can go . i &apos;ll be fine .
actually , we &apos;re going to stay .
yeah .
family sticks it out .
that &apos;s ni--
okay , full disclosure .
we &apos;re hiding out from that crazy white guy .
you came back !
i &apos;m sorry .
you should take some credit for who i &apos;ve become .
okay .
so , let me tell you how i turned out ,
just so you &apos;re crystal clear on your impact .
i am not well @-@ adjusted .
more often than not , i am barely keeping it together .
i &apos;m constantly texting ,
and there &apos;s no one at the other end .
i &apos;m just a grown man
who can &apos;t even look his own friends in the eye for too long
because i &apos;m afraid that they &apos;ll see
that i am broken .
so you get credit for that .
oh , come on , now--
one time , when i was in seventh grade ,
i told everybody at school that i had appendicitis .
i wanted someone to worry about me .
but when beth brannon asked to see the scar ,
i didn &apos;t want to get found out ,
so i took mom &apos;s scissors , and i made one .
it hurt like hell , but it was worth it .
because i got 17 cards ,
and i still keep them in a box underneath my bed
22 years later
because it proves that someone ,
at some point , cared about me .
you want to see the scar ?
so you get credit for that , too .
this is me .
look , jeff , i , uh ...
daddy !
are you faking a heart attack ?
kind of a hail mary .
happy thanksgiving , dad .
look , you &apos;re probably feeling a very strong urge
to sleep with me right now ,
and that is normal .
sha .
britta , thank you .
you were right .
you &apos;re not going to get all &quot; jock jams &quot; on me , are you ?
no , of course not .
i left my boom box at school .
oh . jeez .
you got to stop doing that .
thank you . come here , brother .
come here , brother .
wow . why don &apos;t you save some for christmas , buddy , okay ?
and then pierce did whiteface over blackface .
no one was amused .
it &apos;s meta . abed gets it .
so , troy , how was your first real thanksgiving ?
no offense to shirley ,
but i don &apos;t see what the fuss is about .
thanksgiving &apos;s the wors--
i heard your thanksgiving wasn &apos;t much better than mine ,
so i thought we could take some time
and be grateful for our real family .
the one we chose .
so pretty .
sit , sit , sit .
we never got to do a shawshank homage ,
not the way i wanted to .
maybe the hardest prisons to break out of
are the ones without locks .
wait , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
after that day , jeff seemed like a man unburdened .
he told me about seeing his father again ,
about how leaving there felt like breaking free
of an emotional prison he &apos;d been in for years .
something about shackles on his heart ?
to be honest , i stopped listening .
i was thinking about christmas .
i hope we do die hard .
i hope it &apos;s in a restaurant .
i hope it lays out as cleanly as it does in my dreams .
i hope it &apos;s cool .
cool , cool , cool .
cheers .
cheers .
happy thanksgiving , everyone , including you , dean .
oh , my .
