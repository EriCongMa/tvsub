don &apos;t forget , greendale ,
it &apos;s the last day to sign up
for the spring semester elective .
horseback riding ! water skiing ! fencing !
those are just a few classes we can afford to offer
if enough people pay to learn hopscotch .
oh , they &apos;ve got a class on how to write jokes .
oh , don &apos;t take that .
i dropped it after the lesson on setups .
the professor is so old ...
so many classes .
i don &apos;t know what to choose .
i &apos;ll give you the same advice my father gave me
the night i lost my virginity .
&quot; just pick one .
they all cost the same . &quot;
you could always take
&quot; the actor inside &quot; with me and troy .
how &apos;d you get dragged into that one ?
our dance teacher encourages us to take acting classes
to tap into our emotional cores ,
so troy and i both decided to take it together .
hmm . foosball was full ?
i &apos;m on the wait list .
don &apos;t give up .
i was on the wait list for this media class
for a year and a half and i finally got in .
&quot; who indeed : a critical analysis
of television &apos;s who &apos;s the boss ? &quot;
the professor of this class is the author of this book .
we got him ?
i know .
so what are you taking , jeff ?
well , while you knuckleheads
are expanding your minds and souls ,
i &apos;ll be expanding my liver
in &quot; italian wine tasting . &quot;
oh ! molto bene !
i &apos;m taking that one , too .
hmm . how do you say &quot; ha ha &quot; in italian ?
i &apos;ll look it up .
come on , jeff , it &apos;ll be fun . i can give you pointers .
pierce , i was a lawyer at a top @-@ tier law firm .
when i wasn &apos;t shielding the wealthy from justice ,
i was drinking their finest wines .
i assume you have your own wine cellar .
pierce does .
and it &apos;s , &quot; ha ha ! &quot;
anyone can have a cellar .
it &apos;s what &apos;s in it that counts .
pierce &apos;s has a special gym with swings and saddles .
uh , we don &apos;t--we don &apos;t discuss the special gym .
uh , attention , please . attetion , please .
all elective forms must be in
by the end of the day .
oh , nice job , manuel welsh .
and good news . there &apos;s still plenty of room
in my p.a. announcements class .
just ten bucks an hour .
第二季第二十集
you &apos;re taking this , too ?
hell , yeah .
got drunk ladies , fancy bathrooms ,
and a room full of free coats .
sorry i &apos;m late , man .
i brought you a present .
&#91; 意语 &#93; 越喝人越帅
from before your chin dimple filled in .
uh , excuse me .
so sorry .
wow .
who is the dumpling with the nice asian pair ?
that &apos;s the first time sexism has made me hungry ,
but she is something .
i fear i may have to let her see me nude .
i might have to take a shot myself .
what &apos;s so funny ?
well , why would a woman want a plymouth on cinder blocks
when she could have a testarossa , 500 horsepower
with a six @-@ speed stick ?
&apos;cause my stick is ribbed for her pleasure .
i think those are wrinkles .
let that breathe .
lingering scent , full body ,
perfect nose .
very nice wine .
i was talking about you .
jeff winger .
wu mei hong long .
oh , what a lovely name for a lovely ...
uh , not interested .
please take weird haircut ,
stupid grin ,
and go sniff another dog &apos;s ass .
hmm hmm , the red dragon ordered a number 37
with a side of pork @-@ fried snap .
when you get up close , she &apos;s very homely .
this is gonna be fun .
i can &apos;t wait till we choose stage names .
which do you think is better ?
trevor st. mcgoodbody or david ?
i don &apos;t think you have to worry about stuff like that .
this class is more about introspection .
drag .
less of a drag .
quiet !
form a trust circle around me
and sit on the floor .
a trust circle ?
it &apos;s just a circle .
it &apos;s a circle . sit down .
acting is revealing , expression .
when we release pain ,
we become visible to each other ,
and that is an actor &apos;s job .
that and , you know ,
pretending to be other people .
let &apos;s start with you .
access and share with us
a profoundly deep and painful memory .
i &apos;m on the playground .
stop taunting me !
i just want to go on the swings !
good .
early childhood is a treasure trove of pain .
that happened this morning .
you &apos;re up .
me ? um ...
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t think , uh ...
i don &apos;t want you to think .
feel !
go back .
dig in . emotilize .
something hurt you .
i was captain of my high school football team .
it was very hard being popular .
what a loser .
okay , great . next person .
i &apos;ve always felt somehow ignored ,
almost invisible .
like every time i go to say something , somebody just--
my uncle put his finger in my no @-@ no !
this--this is where acting begins .
welcome to &quot; a critical analysis of who &apos;s the boss ? &quot;
i am professor peter sheffield ,
and i &apos;d like to begin with a simple question--
who was the boss ?
yes .
angela .
oh , well ! class dismissed !
no , calm down . calm down .
i &apos;m sorry , um ...
mister ... ?
abed .
the answer is not quite that simple , mr. abed .
few are .
now , if everyone could please turn to page 12
in my book ...
loser !
you really have to finish that whole book by tomorrow ?
yeah , but it &apos;s a page @-@ turner .
i &apos;m on the chapter where he traces tony micelli &apos;s genealogy
all the way back to caesar .
well , it &apos;s gotta be better than wine tasting with pierce .
he refused to drink pinot noir
because he thought it was french for &quot; black penis . &quot;
and he &apos;s late . again .
it &apos;s not your fault .
it &apos;s not your fault .
thank u .
oh , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be here .
he wouldn &apos;t miss a chance to pop in and
say something offensive .
one day soon , that man &apos;s gonna
run out of ways to shock people .
everybody ,
this is wu mei ,
and we &apos;re getting married !
but it &apos;s not gonna be today .
so , uh , you &apos;re getting married
to that beautiful young thing ?
well , uh , stranger things have happened .
no , no , they haven &apos;t .
you said you guys just met ?
yesterday , after wine tasting class .
i mentioned that her breasts were larger
than most asian women ,
and , uh , we just got to talking .
turns out pierce has been to china many times .
it &apos;s the only place to get fireworks
that are too dangerous for mexico .
no . i go to visit my factory .
hawthorne wipes are the number one moist towelette in asia .
anyway , after a few minutes , we both just knew
we were meant to be together forever .
or at least until she gets heavy .
and , uh , now we must leave you .
many plans to make .
yes , yes , big plans .
well , what are we gonna do ?
plan an engagement party ?
are you out of your mind ? ! this is a scam .
she &apos;s after him for his money or a green card or something !
they seem to really like each other .
yeah , and pierce married three of his wives
after knowing them less than a month .
maybe he &apos;s just a romantic .
not that you would understand romance .
don &apos;t preach to me about romance , annie .
i had a three @-@ way in a hot air balloon .
guess i &apos;ll do it myself .
want to go ?
mm @-@ hmm .
boy , he seems really worked up .
hey , don &apos;t take on his pain .
tend your own garden .
i &apos;ll see you in class .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , um , i didn &apos;t have a painful experience
to share in acting class , so i made up this story
about my uncle trying to touch my butt .
britta &apos;s attracted to men in pain .
it helps her pretend to be mentally healthy .
really ?
yeah .
i hadn &apos;t noticed .
troy ? nothing good can come of this .
yeah .
i &apos;ll have to think really hard
about how to defuse the situation .
no , uncle lucius !
i don &apos;t want to play in the laundry room !
my emotions !
my emotions !
actors dismissed .
uh , for homework ,
drink a glass of cognac in a bathtub .
troy , i feel like i &apos;m seeing
a whole different side of you .
there &apos;s just so much darkness .
and my soul is darkening ,
and my heart is mad at my kidneys , and ...
my mouth ... mm !
see you tomorrow ?
uh , hello .
oh , hi . i &apos;m glad you could come .
please sit .
i felt like we got off on the wrong foot yesterday ,
and i wanted to offer you my , uh , other foot .
first , let me just say how happy i am for you both .
your parents must be so excited .
are they coming to the wedding ?
oh , they would not miss it .
my mother will make the customary shark &apos;s fin soup ,
and my father will get drunk
and make bad impression of borat .
oh , so your parents don &apos;t mind
having a son @-@ in @-@ law roughly their age ?
no . pierce is a beautiful , wise man ,
very gentle soul .
uh , let me tell you that i am a lawyer ,
so if you need any help at
all navigating the whole green card immigration hassle .
i am dual citizen already .
oh . well , if you &apos;d like me to look at the prenup ...
i assume you have one .
yes , but my father &apos;s lawyers will take care of this .
after all , we must protect our family fortune .
now i &apos;m stumped .
excuse me ?
uh , it was--
that means it was very nice talking to you .
oh , okay , if you say so .
okay .
okay , good @-@ bye .
why were you grilling her ?
listen , i &apos;m gonna bust into her apartment .
do you have any grappling hooks .
maybe pierce finally found his soul mate .
how can you say those things without any trace of irony ?
that &apos;s why they call me irony @-@ free annie .
mm , trust me , that &apos;s not what they call you .
yes ?
oh . mr. abed . what can i do for you ?
i finished your book , professor ,
and i &apos;ve been watching episodes of who &apos;s the boss ?
and i think there &apos;s something that you might have overlooked .
mr. abed , will you look at my wall ?
mm @-@ hmm .
what do you see ?
photographs .
of what ?
you .
with whom ?
tony danza , judith light ,
alyssa milano ,
who &apos;s the boss ? season three caterer ,
gordon &quot; giddy @-@ up &quot; galligan .
i have studied this show , mister abed .
i am not a fan ,
i am not a groupie ,
i am an academic .
when i ask the question , &quot; who &apos;s the boss ? &quot;
it is a rhetorical question .
when i ask the question beyond the question , &quot; what is a boss ? &quot;
i really think it &apos;s angela , because if it &apos;s a boss ...
enough !
i would like you to leave my room .
my mind is open , professor .
it &apos;s as open as the door to mona &apos;s bedroom .
it &apos;s a shame yours isn &apos;t .
i beg your pardon ?
you know ? i just got a wonderful idea .
why don &apos;t you teach the next class ?
that way you can share your open mind with everybody .
cool . cool cool cool .
pchew .
i couldn &apos;t be more touched
that you all threw us an engagement party .
you said if we didn &apos;t , you &apos;d slash our tires .
she is funny .
like oprah .
oprah &apos;s not a comedienne .
no , you are funny , and you are like oprah .
yeah .
what ?
thank you .
pierce , i &apos;d like to offer my sincere congratulations .
it &apos;s hard enough to find people
you can stand in this life ,
let alone someone who &apos;s willing to stomach
your imminent dementia and present incontinence .
thank you , jeff .
i just hope she can satisfy me .
i &apos;m like an insatiable baboon in the bedroom .
don &apos;t sell yourself short .
you &apos;re a baboon everywhere .
seems like just yesterday
me and abed dined and ditched here .
here , hold this .
ugh , what is this ?
i always carry some spare apps in case the wait staff &apos;s racist .
where &apos;s a napkin ?
uh , here you go .
oh , thanks .
check that out .
hats off to pierce and the hot red dragon .
why do you keep calling her that ?
&quot; hong long &quot; means red dragon .
but that &apos;s her middle name .
in china , they put the last name first .
i mean , they &apos;re nuts over there .
thank you all for coming .
i know it seems fast ,
but when you find the right person , you just know it .
i know that because i &apos;ve found the right person seven times .
so the drinks are on me , but stick to the crappy stuff .
i don &apos;t want to get corn @-@ holed on the bar tab .
pierce , you can &apos;t just throw around a term like that .
corn @-@ hole .
corn @-@ hole , corn @-@ hole !
pierce ! troy was molested !
cool .
troy , we didn &apos;t know .
troy , do you need me to recommend a support group ?
hey , he &apos;s not a victim .
you &apos;re a survivor .
yeah , about that ...
i wasn &apos;t so much &quot; molested &quot;
as much as i &quot; made it up . &quot;
what ?
we &apos;re gonna laugh so hard about this later .
i &apos;d like to propose a toast .
wu mei hong long , better known as mei hong long wu ,
is not only not a greendale student ,
she works for red dragon wipes ,
the number two wipe in asia ,
currently attempting a takeover of hawthorne wipes .
so please , raise your glasses
to saving pierce from the clutches of a corporate spy ,
and to me for being attractive enough
to get a girl like her under normal circumstances .
very impressive , veronica mars .
you learned how to use google .
and you learned to fight your physical desire for me .
oh , stick it .
you suck .
wait , wait , wait .
record scratch app .
where &apos;d everybody go ?
most people went home .
the rest went with chang to your place
to have a ketchup fight .
oh , jeez , i better get back there
before he starts playing monkey drop .
don &apos;t ask .
oh , uh , do you want to come ?
why would i want to go anywhere with judas winger ?
you &apos;re mad at me ? you should be thanking me .
for what ? ruining my relationship ?
what relationship ?
you just met the woman , and the entire thing was a lie .
she was just using you to get your company in china .
and i was just using her to get her company in the sack .
people use each other jeff .
it doesn &apos;t mean that there aren &apos;t good feelings
that go along with it .
i liked her .
she was busty .
i thought we had something .
i was trying to help you .
i think what you were trying to do
is prove that no woman could want me .
oh , you &apos;re here .
look , britta , i &apos;m really sorry .
troy , kissing you was a mistake .
it will never happen again .
good .
before my ex @-@ boyfriend pablo was arrested
for forging church relics ,
he accused me of only being attracted
to a certain kind of guy .
it was hard to understand him , though .
he was pretty huffed up on paint thinners .
well , maybe someday , you &apos;ll fall for someone who &apos;s healthy .
someone who ,
other than his irrational fear of automatic toilets ,
is normal .
who would like to begin today ?
i would .
with a confession .
my uncle never stuck his finger in my plop @-@ plop .
i know . i &apos;m bummed about it , too .
i &apos;m sorry .
i ... want to be interesting .
i want to fit in with you guys .
i want to be able to be an actor .
the pain of not having enough pain
is still pain , young man .
that may seem like an easy resolution , but ...
we &apos;re not writers .
we &apos;re actors .
story doesn &apos;t matter here .
all that matters is our time
in the spotlight .
and so , by all known definitions
of the word &quot; boss , &quot; i.e. , one with authority over another ,
in 9 of 11 known possible fields
in which one might teach , employ , guide ,
oversee , and / or otherwise hold dominion ,
the empirically provable answer
to the question &quot; who &apos;s the boss ? &quot; is ...
angela bauer .
class dismissed .
class dismissed !
there &apos;s a path you take and a path untaken .
the choice is up to you , my friend .
《 神马情况 》 批判赏析
i wonder why jeff and abed didn &apos;t show ?
well , i don &apos;t know about abed ,
but i &apos;m sure jeff just found another life to destroy .
are you still thinking about studying acting ?
i &apos;m auditioning for professor garrity &apos;s
all @-@ black production of fiddler on the roof .
it &apos;s called fiddla please .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
i asked her to come .
i was thinking , maybe you two were meant to be together .
you &apos;re both rude , you &apos;re both deceitful and racist ,
and you both come from moist wipe dynasties .
i think having that much in common
justifies at least one real date .
i guess we could go out to one dinner .
you &apos;re paying .
you &apos;re dressing slutty .
fine .
how about mexican ?
how about thai ?
they &apos;re like chinese mexicans .
hmm , so true .
mmm .
