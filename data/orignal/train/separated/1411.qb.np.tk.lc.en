i thought we were going salsa dancing , not to watch a comedian .
you &apos;re gonna love him . trust me .
the guy &apos;s hilarious .
okay , tell me one of his jokes .
he doesn &apos;t do jokes .
does he have a mallet ?
no .
so then how does he get hit in the head ?
he doesn &apos;t get hit in the head .
he- he makes observations .
he tells the truth in a funny way .
come on . he &apos;s been on johnny carson a hundred times .
who the hell is johnny carson ?
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
gloria and i are from different generations .
and i won &apos;t lie- it isn &apos;t always easy .
i mean , last week she thought
simon and garfunkel were my lawyers .
no i didn &apos;t .
it was a joke .
i don &apos;t get it .
maybe that &apos;s because there &apos;s no mallet .
yeah , i wish i had a mallet right now .
... was to stay in northern california .
did you indicate to her how long that you were gonna take ?
happy valentine &apos;s day .
happy valentine &apos;s day .

oh , that is cute .
cute ?
we spent a lot of time on this .
i don &apos;t see how .
you just cut up one of your boas .
uh- actually , no . we repurposed it .
it was sort of a bob mackie meets martha stewart project .
okay . well , we just thought it would be a nice surprise .
it &apos;s hardly a surprise . i mean ,
you dress her up for every holiday .
i was giving her a bath last night ,
and i still saw traces of martin luther king behind her ear .
all right . not in the spirit . we get it .
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
no . it &apos;s adorable . i just-
i &apos;m really nervous about my closing argument .
oh , you &apos;ve been rehearsing for weeks .
you &apos;re gonna be great .
let &apos;s hope so .
hey , and i was wondering-
since you &apos;re gonna be in court all day-
you can open the chocolates .

hi , dylan .
happy valentine &apos;s day , mrs. dunphy .
oh . dylan , thank you . that is so sweet .

my unending love and admiration-
oh , my god . yay , it &apos;s big !
oh , my god .
i love it . it &apos;s the most beautiful thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
seriously , you gotta put a black light on it .
it &apos;ll blow your mind .
wow ! dylan , i didn &apos;t know you could paint .
oh , i didn &apos;t . i just took a photo
and i put it through this program
that turns it into a painting .
so you two actually did ...
that .
uh @-@ huh .
yeah .
let &apos;s go put this over my bed .
not- no , no .
you don &apos;t need to be in the bedroom at all .
i &apos;ll take it .
did he trump me ? d @-@ money .
you tell me . he made a painting out of a photograph one time .
i have hand @-@ picked a card ,
drawn a heart in the steam on the medicine cabinet ,
and taken claire to fratelli &apos;s ,
a family @-@ style italian restaurant ,
for 17 years in a row .
yeah , he got me . he got me .
第一季第十五集
bye , honey .
see you later .
see you later .
phil , what is that ?
you know , we don &apos;t have to go to fratelli &apos;s tonight .
okay , what do you have in mind ?
well , i thought you might enjoy a night at a hotel .
i would , but would you and the kids be okay ?
i meant together .
yes , i know .
oh . i know . i know . i got it .
so , what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re not getting any sleep tonight ,
so you might want to take a nap at work today .
i always do .
phil ? sweetie .
as long as we &apos;re talking about being a little bit naughty ,
what would you say to a little role @-@ playing ?
role @-@ play ?
mm @-@ hmm .
i &apos;m in .
i &apos;ll set up sleepovers for the kids .
and i &apos;ll swing by after work to pick you up .
no , no . why don &apos;t you meet me in the hotel bar
and see if you can pick me up there .
careful , lady . you &apos;re gonna wake up a sexy sleeping giant .
perhaps i &apos;ll be reginald appleby ,
an english gentleman in town for a polo match .
phil .
or ... honorable businessman from hong kong .
kinda wrecking it .
it &apos;s not a big deal , claire .
i just train tigers for a living .
too ... no ?
are these rose petals ?
yes , to commemorate our love .
i had to settle .
well , your mom might think so ,
but a lot of people think i &apos;m a catch .
no . the case . i- i was this close to nailing it ,
and then my client gets scared and settles .
i &apos;m sorry . maybe you &apos;d like a chocolate .
notice that i have not eaten any of the chocolates .
there were two levels . you know it and i know it .
this is so frustrating .
i had one of the greatest closing arguments of all time-
all about the big government rolling over the little guy ,
and i even had this great moment at the end ...
where i would point to the state seal and i &apos;d say , &quot; shame ! &quot;
oh , that &apos;s what you were doing in the shower .
i was a little worried .
um , that &apos;s manny .
i said we would watch him tonight . i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i didn &apos;t know you were gonna be going through all this .
no , it &apos;s fine . it might be nice to have him around .
he always make me laugh .
hi , manny .
the universe is cold and loveless .
uh @-@ oh . bad valentine &apos;s day ?
i went for the gold- fiona gunderson .
i poured my heart and soul into a poem , left it on her desk .
i even burned the edges to make it look fancy .
and she didn &apos;t like it ?
oh , she loved it .
but this kid durkas told her he wrote it .
well , manny , why @-@ why didn &apos;t you just tell her the truth ?
she was already gone .
and she &apos;s on a date with him at my favorite restaurant ,
great shakes .
how do you know all this ?
i invited her in the poem .
right after the line of ,
&quot; my love is deeper than the great lakes . &quot;
okay , well , this is unacceptable .
oh , boy . here we go .
no , it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
this is what we &apos;re gonna do .
we &apos;re gonna shoot over to great shakes , get a table .
manny can reclaim the love of his life .
you and i can get a couple mudslides .
i don &apos;t know .
durkas is gonna be there .
i &apos;ve seen the kid do a pull @-@ up .
hey , manny , it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day .
it &apos;s not the day you run away from love .
it &apos;s the day you track it down , tie it up and take it home .
now , if we can pull this off ,
you and your little lady friend will be belly up to a ice cream counter
having a milk shake with two straws .
what do you say ?
i like it .
thank you . thank you .
scientists- they don &apos;t know why this is true ,
but it &apos;s true .
women with big rear ends live longer .
man who tell &apos; em that don &apos;t .
did you read about this man ,
a 91 -year old bank robber in texas ?
he goes into a bank-
&quot; the hell did i want ? &quot;
they had over 4,000 photos of him escaping from the bank .
see ? he &apos;s funny , huh ?
mind if i join you ?
i &apos;m clive . clive bixby .
yes , i can see that . i &apos;m juliana .
so , clive , you in town for a convention ,
or do you just forget your name a lot ?
pretty kitty has nails .
i like that .
i &apos;m in town for a trade show .
i design high @-@ end electroacoustic transducers .
wow , that is very ...
specific .
it &apos;s a fancy way of saying i get things to make noise .
so , what &apos;s your story ?
miss america pageant in town ?
you &apos;re a pretty smooth talker , clive .
i &apos;m pretty smooth all over .
sir , there &apos;s no smoking in here .
oh , that &apos;s fine . i &apos;m not actually a smoker .
you &apos;re quite the boy scout , clive .
tell me , would you be interested in
earning a merit badge tonight ?
do you know anything about tying knots ?
i probably shouldn &apos;t be talking to you .
i &apos;m a married man .
well , i just so happen to like married men .
tell me about your wife .
well , she &apos;s beautiful , of course .
really ? well , if she &apos;s so very beautiful ,
why are you here with me ?
because she &apos;s always so tired ...
and she &apos;s always making lists of things for me to do .
maybe if you did them she wouldn &apos;t be so tired .
oh no . she can make list for days .
but back to your mouth and how sexy it is .
mm @-@ mmm . i wanna go back to these alleged lists
and your nagging wife .
i &apos;m not talking about you .
i didn &apos;t mean that . can we try this again ?
yeah .
so if your wife is so beautiful ,
why are you here with me ?
because ...
i respect her too much ...
to do to her ...
what i &apos;m going to do to you ?
oh , jackpot .
i &apos;ll be right back , clive .
do you have eyes on her ? is she here ?
two o &apos;clock- blonde at the back table .
yep . i have a visual .
let &apos;s not talk like that anymore . over .
okay , this is it . i &apos;m off to win the heart of my beloved .
well , this is nice .
i mean , if we can &apos;t have our own valentine &apos;s day ,
it &apos;s nice that we can give somebody else one .
all right , cam . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sor- i &apos;m sorry i have not been attentive .
i &apos;ve been spending the last five months ...
pouring my core beliefs
into the greatest speech that i will ever write ,
and then that moment gets taken away .
hey , buddy . how &apos;d it go ?
i can &apos;t do it , not while durkas is there .
he has the natural confidence . i admire it and fear it .
we will deal with him directly . we need a plan .
could you be more dramatic ?
we need a plan .
in oregon ,
the state legislature ratified a , uh , bill ...
that from now on
it is a crime to have sex in oregon with a farm animal .
how ugly are the women in oregon ?
he &apos;s funny , jay .
i know . see ?
i can tell you &apos;re not- you &apos;re not from oregon .
no .
you are gorgeous .
thank you .
thank you for bringing your father to the show .
oh , no . i &apos;m her husband , dave .
no kidding .
yeah .
what &apos;s it like to be married to someone
who was there when the bible was written ?
what was it called then ? just &quot; the testament &quot; ?
that &apos;s , uh- that &apos;s- that &apos;s good stuff .
oh , now he &apos;s trying to turn out the light .
phone call . over there .
hello ?
uh , yes . hello .
mr. durkas ?
yeah .
this is don jolly ...
with the great shakes corporate office ,
and i have good news for you .
you have been selected to take part in a random survey ...
that you could win cash and prizes .
does that sound like something you &apos;d be interested in ?
yeah , sure .
okay , just a few simple questions for you .
would you please rank your favorite ice creams
at great shakes from least favorite to favorite ?
i don &apos;t know &apos; em by heart .
there should be a menu right there to your right .
to your right . mm @-@ hmm . there you go .
oh . hi , manny .
hi , fiona . can i join you ?
i guess so .
thanks .
and you don &apos;t have to worry about him cheating . that &apos;s for sure .
because if he does , you &apos;ll catch him ...
when he comes home with two sets of teeth in his mouth .
yeah .
so tell me , on the wedding night , what @-@ what did he do ?
did he say he wanted to change into something comfortable
and go into a coma ?
listen , i gotta use the men &apos;s room .
nuh @-@ uh .
i gotta use the men &apos;s room . i &apos;ll be right back .
where you going ? wait a minute .
i &apos;m only joking . that &apos;s what i do .
you know , you &apos;re way younger than i am .
you just don &apos;t look it .
clive , i have a little something for you .
what is it ?
my dress .
my bra .
oh , my g-
my underwear .
my god .
yeah .
what do you say we take this upstairs ?
this is so much better than cheesy garlic bread .
chocolate .
uh @-@ huh . go on .
vanilla .
i &apos;m taking copious notes .
keep goin &apos; , mr. durkas .
so , why would ted say he wrote the poem if he didn &apos;t ?
maybe because you &apos;re the cutest girl in school ,
and you have a laugh that makes science lab seem like recess .
would you be more or less inclined
to visit a great shakes establishment ...
if you knew your satisfaction was guaranteed ?
that &apos;s a dumb question .
excuse me .
it is not a dumb question , mr. -
tarnation ! he hung up .
then you can drop the accent .
delgado . what are you doing here ?
discussing poetry . maybe you &apos;ll like to recite some of yours .
i &apos;m not gonna recite anything .
just admit you didn &apos;t write the poem .
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s talking about .
get out of here before you get your butt kicked .
i &apos;m going over there .
no , i got this .
whoa ! whoa , sir ! sir ? turn around .
sir , you have no right
to claim ownership of another person &apos;s work .
who are you ?
i &apos;m a lawyer .
you have a lawyer ?
it is one thing to lie ,
but then to bully this young man- it &apos;s unforgivable .
and this is what &apos;s wrong with the world today .
the big guy ...
thinks that he can roll right over the little guy ...
until the little guy says , &quot; enough . &quot;
and that &apos;s what this little guy &apos;s doing-
right here , right now .
can we stop calling me &quot; little guy &quot; ? i &apos;m in the 40th percentile .
shh . i got this .
ted durkas clearly did not write that poem .
i know it . he knows it .
deep down in your heart , fiona-
you know it too .
shame !
fine ! whatever . i stole his stupid poem .
you did ?
i told you .
there you go .
i only did it because i had the feelings ,
i just didn &apos;t know how to show &apos; em .
really ? that &apos;s the sweetest thing anyone &apos;s ever done for me .
you &apos;ve gotta be kidding me .
let &apos;s get out of here . this chick &apos;s crazy .

no .
what &apos;s with the pause ?
well , it &apos;s not exactly fair .
