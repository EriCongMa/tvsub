hey , what took you so long ?
come in .
no , no , no .
why we have this secret meeting in the empty loft ?
because i don &apos;t wanna schmidt to find us .
i know , right ?
creepy , right ?
yeah it is .
this place gives me the willies , man .
do you know why they can &apos;t keep a tenant in here ?
why ?
because mrs. beverly died on the toilet .
and to come here on halloween ,
seems risky ...
what risky ?
the ghose situation .
i brought you guys here to talk about schmidt .
i &apos;m really worried about him .
he hasn &apos;t been to work for three days ,
he just sits on the couch eating cold cuts .
and yelling at the news about how nothing matters .
it &apos;s the problem . be honest , it &apos;s a real problem .
right .
he &apos;s just going through the whole thing .
you know , the cece @-@ elizabeth breakup has gotten to him .
right now he &apos;s completely unhinged .
y &apos; all feel that ?
what is going on ?
not saying there is a ghost ,
but i felt the weird breeze go through my body ,
that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
there is no ghost .
guys , i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this . but ...
i miss the old schmidt .
i want him to be happy again .
he &apos;s crumbling before our very eyes .
i &apos;m having a party tonight ,
and i just can him lying on the couch
wiping his tears with deli meat .
i &apos;ll talk to him . okay ?
thank you .
people get wird with breakups .
trust me , i got this .
you got this .
that was winston .
was that you or was that in here , dude ?
don &apos;t do that !
oh , come on obama .
tanks pull in , tanks pull out .
babies are born ,
old people die .
and yet , the world keeps spinning , and spinning , and spinning ,
and one day it stops .
and then what ?
you want ... you want to talk about ... health care ?
that &apos;s mayo , buddy .
yeah , i don &apos;t got this .
pumpkining .
you &apos;re really good at that .
thanks , man .
yeah . what are you carving there ?
it &apos;s a pumpkin .
oh , look at that . that &apos;s beautiful .
my pumpkin !
pumpkin doesn &apos;t matter .
hey . i just wanted to talk to you , um ...
about my party tonight .
you don &apos;t want me to come to the party ?
no , no , no , no , no , no .
jess , do you not want me to come to your party ?
no . i ... no .
doesn &apos;t matter .
i wouldn &apos;t go
if i weren &apos;t throwing it , you know ?
it &apos;s , like , more of a business @-@ networking ...
it &apos;s not a big deal at all . i just won &apos;t come .
i &apos;ll stay at home , and ...
i &apos;ll just hang out in my costume .
oh , wait a minute .
your home is my home .
see you at the party .
what the hell ?
he &apos;s a total maniac .
well , you know what , jess ?
he doesn &apos;t get like this often .
but when he does ,
oh , there is an option .
nick ,
i think it &apos;s time
for schmidt to get a letter from an old friend .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
what old friend ?
forget you heard anything . nothing , j ...
what old friend ?
we need him , nick .
no , we don &apos;t .
we got to bring him back .
bring who back ?
winston , don &apos;t do this !
guys , does nobody listen to me ? !
who is he ?
... without him !
michael keaton .
you stupid ...
michael keaton , the actor ?
the batman ?
nick , are you gonna tell her , or should i ?
i &apos;m not telling her .
fine . i &apos;ll do it .
you will ?
when schmidt was seven years old ...
you &apos;re a terrible storyteller .
i &apos;ll just do it myself , i guess .
when schmidt was seven years old ,
his daddy divorced his mommy ...
and schmidt was left without the love of a father .
he didn &apos;t take it well .
he began an endless cycle of crying and chocolate .
mrs. schmidt tried everything to cheer him up ,
but nothing worked .
desperate , she looked to the stars .
movie stars .
mrs. schmidt wrote that little fat loser
a letter of support from the star
of his favorite movie , batman .
but not the confusing new one ,
the good one , with michael keaton .
and when schmidt got his disgusting chubby hands
on keaton &apos;s letter ,
his life changed forever .
yes !
but the real trouble was just beginning .
you see , schmidt wrote back .
and he kept writing back about any problem he faced :
bullies , schoolwork , public erections .
and for every letter he sent , michael keaton sent one back .
was winston &apos;s version shorter ?
then one day , that tubby goon went off to college .
so mrs. schmidt unloaded the secret
on her son &apos;s only friend ,
a man named me . it was me .
yeah , i got that .
really ? people don &apos;t ...
no , i got it .
college proved tough for schmidt ,
and old patterns soon returned .
it became impossible to study , and i knew what i had to do .
and again ...
new message .
it worked .
with keaton in his corner ,
he pulled himself away from that bag of turkey
and became a man .
one ...
he lost five pounds ,
gained confidence with women ...
... and he saw the hit movie multiplicity .
25 times .
oh , my god .
you &apos;ve been catfishing schmidt .
do you think we could use this whole michael keaton thing
to turn schmidt around ?
absolutely .
great !
but i won &apos;t do it .
why not ?
because i put it to bed , okay ?
it &apos;s over .
he &apos;ll do anything keaton says .
the letters are too powerful .
i &apos;m lying to my best friend .
and i also feel like i &apos;m betraying the real keaton
who i really love .
well , then why did you tell me that whole story , nick ?
because it &apos;s a great story , and i &apos;m a teller of stories .
but i won &apos;t do it . sorry .
you think you tell that story better than me ?
look , you leave out way too many details , man .
you don &apos;t just say he was chewing a candy bar .
you say he was chewing on a nougat @-@ y candy bar .
that &apos;s not the kind of writer i am .
i don &apos;t say words like &quot; nougat @-@ y . &quot;
i &apos;m simple . i &apos;m like hemingway .
hey , cece .
oh , hey .
i came to find out if you &apos;re coming to my party today .
you never answered my e @-@ mail .
yeah , i meant to , uh ... to tell you i can &apos;t make it .
sorry . um ...
i &apos;ve been going out drinking a lot lately .
it &apos;s kind of wiping me out .
please come to my party , cece .
it &apos;s schmidt , you know ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready for that , so ... yeah .
what if i could promise you schmidt wouldn &apos;t be there ?
who wants candy ?
did you go trick @-@ or @-@ treating ?
no .
i was out , i had my errand tote ,
and a couple of neighbors gave me candy .
is that trick @-@ or @-@ treating ?
yes , that &apos;s the definition of trick @-@ or @-@ treating , jess .
hello ! uh , jess , i &apos;d like you to know that i &apos;ve changed my mind ,
and i won &apos;t be coming to your party tonight .
i &apos;ve been e @-@ mailing with an old friend of mine , and he made me
realize that i should give cece her space .
an old friend , huh ?
well , nick knows .
you know . i don &apos;t like to throw his name around
because i don &apos;t like people treating me any differently
but ... it &apos;s michael keaton .
what ? !
uh , okay . calm down .
the actor ? !
seriously , you guys . don &apos;t treat me any different .
he &apos;s kind of my friend . michael keaton .
there was one time he e @-@ mailed me .
he said he was my best friend .
anyway , we have so much catching up to do ,
me and michael , so just enjoy the night .
that &apos;s crazy , schmidt .
ah , man .
what did you do ?
jessica damn day .
i just got schmidt to not come to the party .
keaton hasn &apos;t written schmidt in three years .
we have no idea how schmidt is gonna react .
if schmidt finds out keaton isn &apos;t real ,
it &apos;ll destroy the entire life he has built around him .
we are talking about a truman show situation .
讲述主角楚门生活在被人刻意架构起来的电影场景里而不自知
oh , yeah , i love that movie .
what part are you talking about ?
well , i &apos;m talking about the part in the movie
when truman realizes that his whole life is a lie ,
and then he goes crazy .
yeah , yeah , yeah , right there in the middle of the movie .
no , it &apos;s the whole movie .
oh , yeah , i know , i was just-- &apos; cause there &apos;s the one ...
there &apos;s like a scene .
you haven &apos;t seen it .
he didn &apos;t see the movie . okay , guys ,
he almost found out once .
now , luckily , i handled it .
i don &apos;t understand .
in 1995 , he told me specifically
that he had never been to nicaragua .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense . aah !
you have no idea what you &apos;ve done .
you guys , do you think that it &apos;s too early
to e @-@ mail michael back ?
should i send him an e @-@ card ?
does that change anything ,
or does that change everything ?
i think you &apos;re overthinking it .
you know what ?
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
be cool .
i think i &apos;m way too up here , all upstairs .
got to bring it down-- here to here .
not any lower , though . it &apos;s not like that .
i know it &apos;s not .
bro , it &apos;s not like that .
no one thinks it is , bro .
cool .
all right .
he &apos;s already getting weird .
here .
no , je ...
you ... come to the master .
what are you writing ?
i fixed it again .
you &apos;re welcome again .
so you just wrote from keaton ,
&quot; i &apos;m going on vacation &quot; ?
he would never write that , jess .
why not ?
vacation ? !
oh , michael , you ... stop going away .
i knew this would happen .
hey , schmidt .
schmidty .
he left me again .
it makes sense .
why would a guy like michael keaton
be friends with me anyway ?
i &apos;m sure he likes you a lot , schmidt .
why would he ?
i guess i &apos;ll just always be
the fat boy who eats fat @-@ boy cheese .
i didn &apos;t want to have to do this .
oh , is that really necessary , nick ?
what ?
let him work .
i &apos;m kind of like his robin .
you &apos;re not like my robin .
you want to be robin ?
he doesn &apos;t have all the responsibilities of batman ,
but he can take some of the glory .
robin &apos;s a joke .
robin &apos;s the joke .
i think we can all agree .
the kids look up to him , you know , in the community .
i haven &apos;t been inside keaton &apos;s mind in a long time ,
and i need my proper inspiration .
thank you .
why do you have a picture of a bear ?
the great michael keaton attacks each new role
with the ferocity of a hungry brown bear .
it is his entire acting philosophy ,
which i totally made up .
i sleep with this person .
speak to me , keaton .
here we go .
oh , hey , nick , that &apos;s incredible .
&quot; courage is not the absence of fear but the triumph over it &quot; ?
yes , i stole that from nelson mandela .
i added the part about the penguin and the riddler .
oh . all right .
is that him ? did it work ?
he wrote back smiley face .
he wrote back smiley face .
he wrote back smiley face .
trick or treat !
oh , how adorable .
you know , i just got a treat , too .
it &apos;s not candy ,
i &apos;m not a ... not a dumb little baby like all of you .
&quot; happy hallow &apos;s eve . &quot;
and send .
just give us our candy .
hush , little boy .
he wrote back .
&quot; hi . &quot;
okay , i got this .
&quot; speak to me , old chum .
i canceled my trip to provide earthquake relief . oh .
this seemed more important . &quot;
that &apos;s so good .
yeah , it &apos;s pretty good .
you really have the keaton voice down .
&quot; you &apos;re a friend for life . &quot;
that &apos;s good .
&quot; m.k. &quot;
i think that &apos;s good .
i think that &apos;s really good , actually .
yeah .
hi . welcome . happy halloween .
drinks are over there .
what are you supposed to be ?
i &apos;m joey ramona quimby .
i don &apos;t get it .
joey ramone ... a quimby .
what are you ?
you look like you &apos;re just wearing trash from your car .
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m the paper mountain trash king ...
i just got trash from my car .
and now the man who once played center for the new york knicks
in the nude , david letterman !
that is a terrible letterman .
really ?
people at work tell me i look just like dave .
you look just like letterman .
you know , i have always thought that .
what , uh , what ... uh , nick , nick miller .
so you a , uh ... ?
you &apos;re a ...
what is that ?
that &apos;s , that &apos;s his laugh .
he &apos;s never done that .
that &apos;s his laugh .
do you like my costume ?
i &apos;m a public serpent .
um , i thought you weren &apos;t coming .
oh , i changed my mind .
you know , i reread a few of keaton &apos;s e @-@ mails .
he can be quite cryptic .
i think what he meant when he said that life was meaningful was really ,
&quot; go to the party . &quot;
i &apos;m pretty sure he didn &apos;t mean that .
i know keaton best . hey , winston ,
by the way ,
great costume .
maya angelou .
crap . what am i gonna do ?
cece &apos;s on her way .
schmidt is rereading e @-@ mails .
do you know what happens after rereading ?
figuring it out . it &apos;s the truman show .
truman show , man , i love that movie .
i &apos;m not convinced you &apos;ve ever seen it .
i have , it &apos;s about the civil war .
batcave ? go , go , go , go , go ,
winston , go to cece &apos;s and stall .
okay , fine , but i got to hit the little
king of the late night talk show &apos;s room first .
maybe slow down on that .
you &apos;re not great with booze .
hey , i got it , i got it .
you got it ? good .
um , &quot; you &apos;re in grave danger .
leave where you are immediately . &quot;
send . okay .
don &apos;t !
you just sent that ?
yeah .
a team has to talk about a decision before you hit send .
sorry . i thought it was a really good move .
trick or treat .
all right , you got to fix this .
i &apos;ll meet you at your building in 30 minutes .
terrible !
send .
no !
what ?
now what are we gonna do ?
you told him keaton was coming here ?
no , nick .
are you out of your mind ?
it &apos;s a stall !
it &apos;s a stall until we can come up with a better plan .
well , who the hell is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
trick or treat !
you .
i don &apos;t get what you &apos;re doing !
are you drunk ?
a little .
what &apos;s your endgame here ?
it &apos;s halloween night .
this is the night when anyone
can dress up in a costume
and be anybody that ... they want .
would you listen to your woman voice for one second ?
oh , you think i &apos;m gonna talk to him in a woman voice when i &apos;m talking to him ?
no , i have a character .
you &apos;re doing a character ? well , i &apos;d love to hear it .
i &apos;m the batman .
right ?
so good .
what , am i in the movie theater , eating popcorn ?
jess , you &apos;re also five , four .
keep going further away . the further you &apos;re away ,
the bigger you look . i would say run a little bit .
nick !
jess , go ! go ...
hey . uh , nick .
by chance , have you seen anyone famous in the vicinity ?
this vicinity ? famous ? like , um ...

oh , my god .
yeah , it &apos;s unbelievable .
well , it &apos;s my hero .
yeah .
that is michael keaton .
right there .
why is he wearing
his costume from the movie he did 24 years ago ?
if he wore the outfit from clean and sober ,
you wouldn &apos;t recognize him .
i &apos;m the batman .
it &apos;s halloween . don &apos;t overthink it .
well , you saw him . there he is . let &apos;s get out of here .
i have to meet him , nick . i have to .

our heroes are never who we want them to be !
oh . you met him .

come on , you guys . i know .
i &apos;ve known the whole time . what , do you think i &apos;m stupid ?
no . it just ... i ...
just don &apos;t really know what to say in this situation .
look , please don &apos;t blame nick . it &apos;s not his fault .
you should be ashamed of yourselves .
how dare you hack into the private e @-@ mail account
of one of our nation &apos;s finest actors !
i &apos;m gonna have to tell michael about this .
no ! no !
no , don &apos;t tell michael !
jess , please stop .
thank you for what you &apos;re trying to do , but it &apos;s over .
it has to be over .
schmidt , i &apos;m michael keaton .
i &apos;m the owner of the e @-@ mail address
keatonpotatoes @ aol.com.
what ?
it was me ... the whole time .
no .
no , you can &apos;t ...
how do you think
i know that you kissed the bus driver at spring break ?
or that you want to open up
a glassware boutique in connecticut ?
or about the wall hole ?
this is impossible ! i &apos;ve been ...
i &apos;ve been writing with michael keaton since i was a kid !
your mother came up with the idea , schmidt .
but since college , it &apos;s been me .
my mom ? you &apos;re gonna tell me
that my mom helped me with my public erections ?
i drew pictures !
he didn &apos;t want you to find out this way .
i got to go .
wait . schmidt !
oh , i &apos;m so , so sorry . uh ...
a bully ! get him !
come on . hey , kids , get out of here !
scat ! scat ! back off !
cece , wait . i swear , i did not know
he was gonna be here . i &apos;m so sorry .
no , jess . it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s fine .
okay , it &apos;s fine .
in fact ... it &apos;s actually kind of perfect .
i think , since this whole thing went down ,
i &apos;ve just been running away .
you know , i mean , actually seeing schmidt , i ...
i finally feel like i have some closure .
well , good . i &apos;m glad .
you deserve some .
so let &apos;s fire up the batman mobile , go to a taco stand ...
... and eat some feelings , okay ?
okay , i just ... i think it &apos;s batmobile .
batman mobile .
no . batmobile .
that &apos;s what i said-- batman mobile .
you &apos;re putting the man ... there &apos;s no man .
it &apos;s just bat ...
batman .
mobile .
mobile . batman mobile .
batmobile . drop the man . bat ... yeah .
batman mobile .
batmobile .
batmo @-@ mobile .
so it was you who helped me
through my first breakup with elizabeth ?
yeah , schmidt .
and it was you , not keaton , who told me
that women aren &apos;t attracted to men who wear maternity pants ?
yes , but that one i feel like i shouldn &apos;t have had to .
they &apos;re unbelievably comfortable .
what about that time that we saw michael keaton
at that deli , and he stopped , and he winked ?
honestly , i can &apos;t explain that one .
it was just the weirdest day of my whole life .
my friend michael .
oh , schmidt , look , i know this is hard , okay ?
but honestly , i was just trying to help .
you don &apos;t need keaton . you got me .
what was that ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
what ... why would you say something like that ?
because i hurt you ,
and i &apos;ve been wanting to fix this for years .
the end of a high school football movie ?
i &apos;m really sorry i pretended to be keaton for the last 12 years .
it &apos;s super weird .
are we good ?
yeah . we &apos;re good .
well , nicholas , i came to a decision last night .
i &apos;m entering a new chapter in my life ,
and i think it best that i do it alone .
you &apos;re going to one of those weekend spas again , buddy ?
no .
in the famous words of singer @-@ songwriter billy joel ...
don &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m moving out .
you &apos;re the worst .
schmidt , i thought you said we were good .
no , we &apos;re great , but i &apos;m going .
two separate things .
i made the call this morning .
i got a new place . i &apos;m out .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
i &apos;m going .
goodness , uh , i think somebody had sex
in my bedroom last night .
i think that because they &apos;re still in there
having sex , i think .
hey , schmidt . you going to a weekend spa again ?
no . striking out on my own .
wait . what ? !
you &apos;re moving out ? he &apos;s not moving out , is he ?
schmidt , you can &apos;t move out .
who &apos;s gonna do my fades ?
yeah , who &apos;s gonna do his fades ?
believe this is mine .
well , i bid you all adieu .
stop it , schmidt .
oh , schmidt ! are you serious ?
schmidt , come on .
come on .
seriously ? come on !
stop with the show !
you can &apos;t even fit all your socks in that suitcase .
get your last looks , &apos; cause who knows when
we &apos;ll see each other again ?
or where .
wait .
you &apos;re just moving in across the hall ?
i can &apos;t hear you ... &apos; cause i &apos;m gone .
schmidt , it would take me longer to walk from the kitchen
to the bathroom than it would from here to where you are .
oh , you are kidding me .
i can see your feet !
me , too .
shut up .
the guy &apos;s an idiot .
see you tomorrow , schmidt .
i &apos;m alone . i &apos;m alone !
i &apos;m alone .
i &apos;m alone .
score . touch ... score .
yeah . shut up , winston . stupid jerk !
