The door's open.
How you doing?
It's, uh, it's dark in here.
No.
Now, don't be that way.
He misses you.
It's not just the money.
He wants you back.
Where is he?
Home.
He sent me here to...
Don't, Bill.
It's a phone. I'm just getting you on...
You pull it out, and I'll shoot your hand off.
Get down on your knees.
And keep your hand where it is.
Who called my work?
Who? Y-Your lawyer called us.
We returned.
Phone, huh?
Who called her at home?
Your lawyer?
Uh, I did. Why?
What was that for?!
He'll get angry if I don't answer.
Aah, you bitch!
You stupid bitch!
You bitch!
Quiet, Bill.
Go to hell.
Just go to hell.
Hi, honey.
Bill's here. You want to talk to him?
Just so you know,
the money is mine-- community property.
I don't want any trouble, but I am staying put and it's over.
I've moved on. You should, too.
You run again,
he'll find you.
What's going on?
Nothing. I don't know.
Is that for us?
What'd we do?
Okay, uh, Zach, put your signal on.
Grace, turn the radio down.
I shouldn't have fallen asleep.
Hi there. How's it going?
It's good.
Can I see your driver's license, registration
and proof of insurance?
Sure.
What'd we do wrong?
Grace.
Where you all headed?
Uh, home. Chicago. Highland Park.
And where you coming from?
Washington University.
We were checking out colleges.
Ah. Sorry, I can't really hear very well here.
Could you step back with me,
I'll tell you why I stopped you?
Sure.
How fast were we going?
I don't know.
Not that fast.
Maybe it's Uncle Owen's car?
Maybe he has tickets or something.
Wait here.
Tell him we just bought it.
Everything all right, Officer?
Yes, ma'am. Why don't you stay right there,
and I'll be right with you.
So there's nothing wrong?
Thank you, son.
As I was just telling your son, about a half mile back
I saw him hit the brake lights when he saw me and then speed up again.
I thought maybe he was having some trouble.
Was he?
Having some trouble?
No.
He said you were asleep, so...
Just so you know, officer, my son just bought this car...
Here's the thing.
Your son seemed a bit worried
when I was talking to him just now,
and this roadway is a major conduit
for drugs, money, weapons...
He's 17 years old, being questioned by a police officer.
that's probably why.
You're probably right, but,
if you don't mind, I have my K-9 in my car here.
I'd like to just run him around your vehicle,
just to be on the safe side.
Officer, are we being profiled here?
I... How do you mean, ma'am?
Well, I was asleep in the backseat,
and you saw two kids driving at 8:00 in the morning.
You thought maybe drugs?
而仅因为车主属于"可疑人群" 是不合法的
No.
But if you don't mind, ma'am,
I'd really like to run my dog around your car,
and you'll be on your way.
And if I do mind?
It's like a police state.
You should just use Dad's name.
What?
Why?
He'll stop hassling us if he knows
you're connected with the state's attorney.
That's Cook County. This is Madison County,
and we don't do that.
We don't use Dad's name; we use the law.
You use Dad's name?
How do we use the law?
Hey, Cary, it's Alicia.
Do you know anyone in Madison County's state's attorney's office?
We've just been pulled over on interstate 55,
and I think it's a result of profiling.
So I need to get the, uh, patrol car's dashboard camera.
Go, Mom.
Yeah. Get him fired.
You should call his captain.
Sure. I'll see what I can do.
You got the car number?
Yes. It is...
4-1-9. It's an Officer Robb and it's K-9 unit.
No problem.
Oh, yeah, and Eli called.
Something about the interview.
I forgot.
Thanks, I'll call him.
I'm not upset. Do I sound upset?
You just threatened to sue us.
No, I said I was going to sue you.
That's not a threat; that's a fact.
I'm packing up and filing a suit.
David, this balloon payment came due
at the exact moment we lost our top client.
We are suffering through the worst recession...
Okay, at a certain point,
you have to stop with the recession talk and own this bankruptcy.
Look, we definitely have some issues to work out internally,
but if you leave now and file suit...
Yep, always in time for the Fall of Saigon.
美国称之为西贡沦陷
Uh, h-hold on, Eli.
Okay, here's the thing.
I run my dog around your car, and on the passenger side,
he starts scratching and barking.
I now have probable cause to search in the state of Illinois.
But I want to give your son one last chance,
so if he has any small personal amount of marijuana,
I need to know.
Search if you're gonna search.
Sorry, Eli. Actually, I'm gonna be late.
What? Why? We arranged this weeks ago.
Well, circumstances are beyond my control.
This is a national sit-down, Alicia.
You've got to get it under control.
Okay, got to go.
Peggy.
I'm just showing Peter a campaign ad, Eli.
That's all. It's not an ambush.
Let me just say this to Jax, who is watching on TV right now
and has been an inspiration to me every single day of my life.
My dad asked me if it was all right if he runs,
and I said yeah,
'cause he does a really good job of taking care of me,
and I think he'd do a really good job of taking care of everyone.
I am running for governor of the great state of Illinois.
So, Kresteva is making the campaign about family values?
Look, I think the campaign's about a lot of things:
our bankrupt state, drugs coming across the border, education...
But Kresteva is dening himself as a good father and husband,
and you, in a recent deposition,
are admitting that you are separated from your wife.
Separated but working to mend fences.
Look, Peggy,
this is gonna be a long campaign.
Kresteva is the Republican candidate
I will be facing in four months.
My goal now is to win the Democratic nomination.
The Democratic Committee stands beside you,
so isn't that a foregone conclusion?
In politics, nothing is a foregone conclusion.
I win the nomination, you can ask me
all you want about Kresteva and his attempts to, uh...
redefine himself as a family man.
His "attempts"? Do I detect a hint of sarcasm?
In four months you can detect a hint of sarcasm.
Okay, I didn't find any drugs at this time in your vehicle,
but I did find shake, marijuana shake,
under your front seat.
What?!
My guess is this is what my dog was signaling.
Mom, that's...
Shh, shh.
Okay, um, thank you, Officer.
So, I'm gonna give you
a ticket and a warning at this time and let you go.
So, if there's nothing, uh...
Son, raise your hand.
Son, I said raise your hand.
Is that a recording device?
It's-it's an iPhone.
An iPhone set to record?
Yes.
Recording an officer is a crime, son.
Under Article 14 of the Illinois Criminal Code,
it's a Class 1 felony.
Actually, that was overturned in the Seventh Circuit.
No, it wasn't. Two-party consent is still on the books.
And I ask you to erase that recording right now.
Wait, so it's illegal to record you doing something illegal?
I'm not doing anything illegal,
and either you erase the recording
or I'll impound the phone.
Mom?
Just do it, Zach.
This is so wrong.
I know. Just do it.
I need you to erase the recording, son.
Now.
Did you just e-mail it?
Okay.
Everyone, let's just take a breath.
Son, did you just e-mail that recording?
It was a mistake.
I did.
Put your hands behind your back.
We are $60 million in debt, Your Honor.
This is mostly due to unforeseen circumstances:
the loss of a major client,
late receivables and an...
exponential increase in our lease.
We believe if we are given
immediate relief from our creditors,
we will need five months to satisfy this debt.
My son has a felony notice to appear.
He what?
Why?
The cop said there was marijuana shake in the car,
but that's not why.
Yeah, shake is what they say when they don't find anything.
What is this, eavesdropping?
Four to 15 years.
Zach was holding a cell phone in his hand.
He... Where is Zach?
He's at home.
But we have to appear tomorrow for the preliminary hearing.
And why is Mr. Gardner not standing with you?
I was suspended from the law for six months, Your Honor.
That suspension ends this week,
then I'll be fighting alongside Miss Lockhart
to restore our firm to its former glory.
Could you talk to your friend at Madison County,
get this cop's record, see if there's any disciplinary action.
They're not gonna pursue this, Alicia.
Okay? Don't worry.
The cop just wanted to make a point.
It's on Zach's record.
He's looking at colleges.
Okay.
I'll give my friend a call.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Gardner,
if this were before the Dewey & LeBoeuf bankruptcy,
I'd probably approve this plan,
but I see the same management problems here
of excessive debt and compensation.
Your Honor, no one wins
if you liquidate us.
I would agree,
but your plan doesn't address the management issues.
But we're management.
Yes, I know.
Why are we being punished for Dewey & LeBoeuf?
We have to get the partners together.
Oh, no.
A new client, I forgot.
We can't be turning down new business.
Cary and Alicia, we need you to take this meeting.
What is it?
It's not one of our most prestigious cases.
I own a tow truck company.
Okay, and, uh, how may we help you with that, Mr. Saverese?
Nick.
So what, I don't get the partners anymore?
Oh, no,
uh, Diane and Will just asked us to get some detail.
Detail, sure. Okay, well, I got a lot of detail.
I'm new to town,
and the government is putting out an RFP
to outsource its tow truck service,
but they won't let me bid.
Why not?
Well, I've had a bit of a problem in my past.
It's nothing big, you know,
it's just, uh, just an arrest.
Nick, let me stop you right there.
You don't want to tell us anything
that might preclude us from working on your case.
Do you need to go?
No. I'm fine.
Well, here's the thing.
I have two businessmen who want to partner with me on this bid.
I supply the service, they act as middlemen.
So, I need your firm to vet them and help me choose one.
Alicia?
Alicia.
So, how is that legal?
How is...
He wants to partner with
someone who doesn't have an arrest record
so he can make a bid on a governmental contract.
Yes, and as long as we keep the bid at arm's length, we're fine.
Look, if we weren't in such bad straights,
we'd probably cut this one loose, but...
No, I get it.
I just, uh, I still have one leg in the SA's office.
And how long have you and your husband been separated?
About a year.
So, you were separated when you stood beside him
for his gubernatorial announcement?
Yes.
And you didn't find this hypocritical?
No.
You seem to prefer one-word answers.
Yes.
Your husband said that you are working on mending fences.
Is that true?
It is.
Can you expand on that?
My husband slept with prostitutes.
That made our marriage difficult.
But we have children together
and my husband apologized,
and I needed time to consider whether to accept that apology.
During that time, we separated.
But now you're together?
We're mending fences.
Do you live in his house?
I have my own apartment,
but I also sometimes stay at his house.
In the same room?
That's none of your business.
Why not?
Because my life is mine.
But you've made your life public,
haven't you?
No.
My husband has.
So, I'd like to ask you this,
Alicia, why do you stay with your husband?
Why not divorce?
Other wives who've been betrayed like you have divorced.
Because I don't want to.
Isn't that setting a bad example to women everywhere
to be such a doormat?
Peggy.
I like my husband.
I respect him.
He's flawed, but I've grown to accept that.
And I committed to a marriage.
I don't like breaking commitments.
Isn't that dragging women back to the '50s?
Women have all the obligation,
men have all the freedom.
I don't know.
This isn't about women or the '50s.
This is about me.
仪表盘摄像头
Hey, there. How's it going?
Good.
Can I see your driver's license, registration...
Come on, Drey.
Here you go.
Get it, boy. There you go. Get it, boy.
What do you got, Drey?
Okay, you know how you're not supposed to shop when you're hungry, hmm?
Well, it's just as important not to do interviews
when you're pissed.
I wasn't pissed, Eli.
And if you don't want me doing interviews...
What I want is for you to stay on message.
Kresteva is making this all about family.
And what's the message about our separation?
You're right, you're right.
I'll set up a meeting to discuss it.
Oh, and I need you to talk
to the CWA next Thursday.
I work, Eli.
I'll talk to Will and Diane. No.
I want to work, Eli.
Peter's free tomorrow night.
We'll discuss it then.
What's that?
Good boy.
What's that? Get that. Get it, boy.
Dig for it.
What do you got, Drey?
Oh, hey, Kalinda,
you have a friend who trains canines, don't you?
Yeah, why?
I think I was subject to a bogus search.
Can I talk to him?
Her. Sure.
What about our bonuses?
The judge approved the plan.
That's the important thing; we avoided liquidation.
But...
I thought you were leaving us, David.
And miss this? Are you kidding?
We avoided liquidation, but the judge assigned
a trustee to supervise our decisions.
Wait, wait.
Everybody will still get paid.
Everybody will still work on cases,
but new cases will be vetted by this trustee.
Meaning he can veto you.
In theory, but he hasn't been assigned to us yet,
so we don't know.
Excuse me.
Our hope is that this trustee
will work closely with us and that he or she
will have as much invested in our success as we do.
Excuse me?
I'm Clarke Hayden.
Yes?
The trustee.
And the paintings, are they leased?
No, we own them.
But the office furniture is leased?
Yes.
Mr. Hayden,
if I could be so bold.
We have a fairly refined clientele,
and if we start dressing down the office,
they'll notice and leave us.
I think that's enough for today.
What I thought I would do is meet
with you both separately
to discuss the current staffing situation.
Uh, what current staffing situation?
Reduction.
That's from my personal collection.
It's pretty.
Thanks.
Do you think we've hit bottom yet?
Nope.
Hey, Mom, did you know you can videotape a cop,
you just can't audiotape them?
Did they teach that at school?
No, it's an old law based on taping phone calls.
You had to have both parties agree to record a call.
What are you reading?
Oh, it's a Web site about my rights.
It's actually pretty cool. Yeah.
Looks like some pretty cool stuff.
缓解+慰藉
I'm not looking at that.
Here, look.
This is the e-mail that I sent myself.
I had my phone set to Bluetooth
so I could play music in the car,
and I never switched it back.
Okay.
Well, look.
This is what I shot.
But listen.
It's a lovely song.
Can we stop it now?
Yes, Your Honor.
My son never recorded audio,
and there can be no Article 14 violation without audio.
Therefore, we ask this court to enter a finding
of no probable cause.
That sounds right to me,
ASA Williams.
Your Honor,
sorry to take over here. ASA Altman.
Uh, we would argue that the problem here
was never Article 14, it was obstruction of justice.
Excuse me, Your Honor, but that wasn't the charge.
Yes, but we would ask
leave of the court to file an additional charge.
Your Honor, this is outrageous.
The only one obstructing justice
is Officer Robb with his illegal traffic stop.
Your Honor, I know Mrs. Florrick isn't from this county,
but we take unfounded charges like that very seriously.
Yes, we do.
Do you have any evidence to that effect,
Mrs. Florrick?
I can gather it.
Then gather it.
And before I hear on the obstruction of justice charge,
I will hear on the legality of the traffic stop.
This is about my husband, isn't it?
Excuse me?
You want to embarrass my husband
by going after my son?
Mrs. Florrick, I don't think we've met.
I'm the state's attorney for Madison County, Phil Tapia.
I don't go after people.
My son is 17 years old.
He has nothing to do with politics.
You want to hurt Peter,
I'll give you his number.
Maybe you can do me the honor, Mrs. Florrick,
of talking to me like I'm not some small-town hood.
My son did nothing wrong.
He obstructed justice.
After an illegal traffic stop.
Well, that will be a hard one to prove.
I have to go now.
And you might tell your husband...
...police love their pensions.
So, am I in trouble?
Not if I can help it.
Come on.
Petey?
So the issue isn't the dog, and it's not the trainer.
The issue is the handler.
So, the handler can force a false positive?
The point is, Petey doesn't need to be encouraged.
He'll alert without prompting.
Now, if I wanted to create a false positive....
Let's go.
Find it. Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Find it. What's in there, Petey?
What's in there? See?
I just found probable cause to search through your file box.
Get it, boy. Dig for it.
What do you got, Drey?
What's in there? What's in there?
That's right.
That's a manufactured false positive.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
You see, I'm a good person.
I never said you weren't.
My dogs miss you.
You know, I never liked the way they looked at me.
There was always something a little bit...
What?
What is it?
So...
both are stable businessmen.
No liens on credit, financially secure.
But due to preferential hiring in government bids,
we would suggest partnering with Mr. Wells.
'Cause he's black?
Yes.
And who did the vetting for you?
Who? Our investigator.
Can I talk to him?
I got a few questions. Just details.
Her, and... sure, yeah.
She just took off.
Um, actually, she stepped out for the moment,
but I'm sure we can answer any questions you have.
No. I like to hear from the horse's mouth.
When will she be back?
I don't know. Soon.
Well,
let's set another appointment.
It's just a few more billable hours, right?
So?
You like that, huh?
What does Will bring to the table?
What does Will, my partner?
Yes.
Everything.
I guess I don't understand the question.
I'm starting at the top with these interviews and continuing down.
I want to get a sense of how things work.
Well, Will is the heart and soul of litigation.
Not for the last six months.
Yes.
He's been suspended,
which is one of the reasons we're struggling now.
You talk about him like he's a trial lawyer,
not a partner.
Just so we know here.
Will's partnership is essential to this firm.
Wouldn't it be better
if only one person was deciding?
No. Don't answer yet.
I want you to think about it.
A lot of my staffing decisions will depend on it.
You guys ready to go to Dad's?
Yup.
Um, I'm just taking this 'cause it's easier,
and my room's empty at Dad's house anyway, so...
Mom, did you get the names of the other people
pulled over by that cop?
Not yet. I think the SA's office is freezing us out. Why?
I got a few names.
Really?
Where did you find them?
Online.
There's a Web site where people share stories
about police abuse, and I asked if anyone had difficulties
with an Officer Robb on Interstate 55,
and three people responded.
Here's their numbers.
Zach, I'm... I'm really impressed.
I will call these tomorrow.
Actually, I...
You already called them?
Skyped them.
This one guy had his car impounded
for having a single joint in his ashtray.
And someone else had $10,000 taken.
Money for a down payment,
but Officer Robb suspected it of being drug money.
It's a forfeiture corridor.
The police department makes money off of drug forfeitures.
They stop out-of-town cars, check for drugs,
and then impound them if they find anything.
Mom, Dad's here.
Zach, I... I think I have to say this again.
I'm really impressed.
Eli, can we have a minute alone?
Don't you think we should do this together?
No, no, it's okay.
But I need to know what events you'll do together,
or they're gonna ask whether you live together...
No. Just... just a minute alone.
Sorry about that.
Life under the microscope.
I don't want the kids doing events, Peter.
I know.
Eli is going to insist.
Kresteva is putting his son front and center.
I know.
No kids.
Good.
Thanks.
So do we?
Live together.
What did you tell the reporter?
"None of your business."
I think we should probably say
that we're working on it.
Are we?
Well, in the sense that nothing's definitive, yes.
Why?
Just helps to know the truth.
I need to tell you something,
because I think it involves you now.
I want to help out with the campaign.
No.
He said what?
He said, "The police like their pensions."
And I told him that if he wanted to come after you,
he should leave our son alone.
Peter, I'm handling it.
I don't want to make things worse, okay?
Don't do anything.
You met with the trustee?
What did he say?
He wanted to know my thoughts on how to reduce staff.
That's it?
No. He...
He asked whether to drop you as a name partner.
He wondered whether you were more important as a litigator,
and whether I should make all the decisions.
Yeah, he said the same thing to me.
What?
Our friend Clarke seems to have learned
his management skills from Mao.
What did he say?
I'm the true litigator.
The firm has suffered through your leadership
over the last six months.
Now it needs a man at the top.
He didn't say, "A man."
No.
I added that to piss you off.
We need to get out from under this.
But we need to make $60 million in five months.
Which we can't do.
Not without David Lee.
You have a problem with my stand on pensions,
you come to me.
Your son was pulled over.
That's all. I'm following the law.
That's right. Same way I will with your son
at the University of Chicago.
So we're threatening each other now?
No. I'm threatening you.
And here's a handy little cheat sheet
for the next time you forget.
I'm the state's attorney of a county that actually matters, jackass!
What do you want?
Three things.
Drop the case, expunge the arrest,
and tell that stupid son-of-a-bitch of a traffic cop
to call my son and apologize.
Give me a day.
I did it. It's done.
I don't want to hear about it.
You miss this.
Don't flatter yourself.
Why were you at my work?
Business.
What business?
Oh, you know, expanding.
Becoming the tycoon.
Were you robbed?
I knew you were coming, so I put everything into storage.
What? My money, too?
So you don't love me anymore.
I want you gone.
What about dinner tomorrow?
Nick... I want you gone.
From Chicago forever.
Yeah, with you.
You're coming home.
No, I'm not coming.
I forgive you, okay?
I just can't stay angry at you.
Well, things have changed.
You see this?
It's my new tattoo.
That is the midnight sun,
and I got it for you.
Means "New beginning."
It's over.
You know why it's not over.
You could've run.
You knew I was coming...
but you stayed.
Will. Hi. Is everything okay?
Yeah. How you doing?
Good.
I've just been...
well, we've been running around in separate worlds.
We have.
Well, if there's anything I can do...
You were interviewed by a reporter a few days ago?
Yes. Peggy Byrne.
Right. Is there anything I should know about that?
About my interview? No.
She wants to talk to me.
To you?
She wants to know how we...
work together.
Well, she... I don't think...
She probably just wants a fuller picture.
Yes.
I suggested she talk to Diane, but...
she said she wanted me.
Well, I don't think that she...
Knows about us?
Yes.
We were... pretty careful.
It's probably nothing.
Well, back to it.
Did you have a dog here yesterday?
Yes. Long story.
Hey, your suspension ends tonight, doesn't it?
It does.
Welcome back.
Thanks.
Uh, Will?
I wonder if you shouldn't talk to her.
The reporter? I was gonna blow her off.
Too busy.
Probably best.
Don't worry.
I got it.
I'm out the door.
I know.
So this interview is a bit pointless,
unless you want me to tell you
where all the bodies are buried.
So, what do you want?
You're one of our creditors now.
Your creditor?
I like to identify with the firm.
Well, then yes, I am owed $1 million for my capital contribution,
my yearly draw is five percent,
and so I am owed approximately $3 million.
Hm. It's good that you're leaving, then.
"It's good." What do you mean?
It's less of a burden.
Five cents on the dollar makes it $150,000.
No. I was a partner-- first money in is first money out.
Mm-hmm, for partners--
but you'll be a creditor.
So thank you.
Wait a minute.
I'll be a creditor in name only.
I put up the capital contribution.
Yes, and thank you. Good luck.
Wait.
80 cents on the dollar.
Mr. Lee, you misunderstand me.
I'm not negotiating.
You'll get five cents on the dollar,
and you'll get it last--
after we pay off the lease, the furniture, the bottled water delivery,
then we'll get to you.
Why?
I don't like people who quit.
What do you got, Drey? What's in there?
What's in there? Good, boy.
Your Honor, Officer Robb creates false positives in order to
search cars for drugs...
What does this have to do with obstruction of justice, Your Honor?
There was no obstruction,
there was only an illegal impounding of my son's cell phone.
Oh, come on.
This section of the interstate is a forfeiture corridor,
a place where the police and the state's attorney, Phil Tapia,
make their money from the war on drugs
by illegally impounding cars and cash.
We have witnesses who haven't received their cars and cash back
after stops by Officer Robb.
Maybe it's not a problem in Mrs. Florrick's county,
but we have a drug problem in Madison County.
Then why are all these stops
being made on the north-running side?
My son checked these traffic stops
resulting in drug searches.
Over the last six months,
90% of them were made on the north-running side of the highway.
Why is that important?
Because all the drugs are coming from the Canadian border
down the south-running side.
And all the money made from these drug sales heads up the north.
They're not trying to stop drugs.
They're trying to confiscate the money
made from these drug sales.
That is an outrageous lie, Your Honor.
Mr. State's Attorney...
Your Honor, these are very serious allegations.
That's putting it lightly.
And we intend to refute them.
We ask for a trial date
to give us time to prepare.
For what? For the obstruction of justice charge,
or for the impounding?
The obstruction charge, of course.
We can do this.
Together we can do it.
Thank you for coming out.
You send your wife against me?
What?
You think Cook County is above our problems?
Get off my bus.
You came after my forfeiture corridor.
I don't know what you're talking about.
We are coming after your son to the fullest extent of the law.
You want to come after my corridor, I'll come after yours.
My guess is your haul on I-94 is ten times what mine is.
And I'm not the one running for governor.
I just want to say I decided to stay.
You've shown me loyalty; I want to show you the same in return.
Can't wait to get started.
Just wanted to tell you,
I'm staying. Talk to you later.
Did you...?
Yes. What happened?
What?
I don't know.
Maybe Mao's not so bad if he works for you.
Kalinda.
Hmm?
You okay?
Yeah. Good.
We have another meeting with that new client.
Um, could you sit in? He's got some questions about the vetting.
The new client?
Mr. Tow Truck Saverese.
He asked for you yesterday, but you stepped out.
He'll be in in an hour.
Wow, you are really somewhere else today.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll-I'll sit in.
Okay, good.
Hey. Good job with the video.
I would have never thought of that.
What? What video?
The one online about your traffic stop.
Smart, like "Breakfast in Collinsville."
...A ticket and a warning at this time and let you go.
So, if there's nothing...
Meet Officer Robb.
a four-year veteran
of the Madison County Police Department,
and a real putz.
Could I see your driver's license, registration, proof of insurance?
What'd we do wrong?
It turns out we did nothing wrong--
except get stopped by Officer Robb.
*Good morning, here's the news *
*And all of it is good *
*And the weather's good! *
Hello?
This is Officer Curtis Robb.
Is this Zachary Florrick?
Yes.
I wanted to say...
I'm sorry...
about pulling you over.
I was wrong.
Really?
Yeah, I think we're dropping the case,
and expunging your arrest.
And... that's it.
Okay?
Okay.
Great.
I'm going now.
500,000 views? Really?
Kids.
Hi. I'm Kitty, and I'm ready-- to talk...
I've, uh, given it some thought.
I need Will.
It can't be just one partner.
Lockhart & Associates?
No.
We're a team.
All right.
Then come tomorrow ready to work.
We have to cut 30% from the staff.
Ready?
Five, four,
three, two, one.
You're a lawyer again.
Just like that.
An odd year, huh?
