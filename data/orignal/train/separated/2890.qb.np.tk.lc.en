chandler , you &apos;re doing so well with this whole getting married ...
... never gonna sleep with anyone for the rest of your life thing . i thinks it &apos;s great .
hey . who wants french toast ?
i &apos;ll have some .
me too . eggs and milk in the fridge . thanks .
what &apos;s the matter ?
my hand feels weird .
i guess it &apos;s because i &apos;m engaged !
when will that start getting annoying ?
start ?
let &apos;s start the wedding plans .
okay .
already ?
we got a lot to do . we gotta think about the flowers , the music ...
i have thoughts on the music ...
chandler . too many cooks .
take it from me . all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name .
what in god &apos;s name is that ?
oh , my god , the wedding book ?
i haven &apos;t seen that since fourth grade .
this baby has everything . take , you know , locations , for instance :
first organized alphabetically , then geographically ...
... then by square footage .
that is so smart .
break it off . break it off now .
look , here &apos;s the invitation you used to your wedding to john lynch in the fifth grade .
remember how i got sick and ross had to fill in as a bridesmaid ?
i was a brides @-@ boy .
i don &apos;t smell french toast , brides @-@ boy .
the one with rachel &apos;s book
that conclusively proves ...
... that i had the idea for jurassic park first .
let &apos;s take a look ...
phoebe , what are you doing here ?
i need to talk to you . it &apos;s urgent . it &apos;s about monica and chandler .
oh , my god . of course .
would you please excuse me for a moment ?
do you know each other &apos;s hometowns ? why don &apos;t you ... ?
what &apos;s going on ?
well , not much . i was just thinking that since they just got engaged ...
... it would be nice if they have privacy .
so could i just move in with you for a couple days ?
okay , sure . but what &apos;s wrong with monica and chandler ?
nothing . why ?
phoebe , you said it was urgent .
yeah , it is . my movie starts in , like , five minutes .
do you realize i have a classroom full of students ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so rude.does anyone want to come to the movies ?
i haven &apos;t cleared the budget with my parents ...
... but tell me how this is for music :
a string quartet for the processional , a jazz trio for cocktails ...
... the bay city rollers for dancing ...
wait , that was for my sixth grade wedding .
you couldn &apos;t get them anyway . lan doesn &apos;t even play anymore and derek ...
derek is a name i shouldn &apos;t know .
mon , do you have another pillow , something a little snugglier ?
why are you napping here instead of at your place ?
the duck .
what ... the duck ?
what the hell did the damn duck do now ?
well , he did not get sick somewhere in there ...
... and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up .
do i get to look at this book ...
... or is it just for people involved in the wedding ?
of course you can look at it . i want your opinion .
here you go .
what about centerpieces ?
centerpieces !
roses or lilies ?
definitely roses .
i think they &apos;re more &quot; wedding @-@ y . &quot;
but lilies are the clear choice .
oh , my god , it &apos;s like one mind .
guys , guys , you gotta let me nap .
i &apos;m gonna get cranky .
joey , there &apos;s a perfectly good couch across the hall .
yes , it is perfectly good ...
... and it is not one of the places the duck got sick .
what ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna go .
joey , what did the duck do ?
i don &apos;t know , but he did not eat your face cream .
hey , little buddy . how you feeling ?
what the hell is in that face cream ?
that &apos;s so soft .
pillowcases !
&quot; zelda looked at the chimney sweep . her father , the vicar ... &quot;
vicar ?
... &quot; wouldn &apos;t be home for hours .
her loins were burning .
she threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his ... &quot;
this is a dirty book !
phoebe ?
oh , ross , hi .
phoebe , what are you doing ?
sorry , i &apos;m with a client right now .
phoebe !
okay , let &apos;s talk outside .
unfortunately , this time will be counted as part of your massage .
so try ...
... and think relaxing thoughts .
and don &apos;t touch any of my dinosaurs .
i know they &apos;re cool , but they &apos;re mine .
phoebe , you can &apos;t massage people in my apartment .
i did it at monica and chandler &apos;s .
and they knew about it ?
okay , ross , what is this really about ?
this is my home and i want to be able to come and go when i want .
i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments .
i don &apos;t know what the big deal is .
i don &apos;t want naked , greasy strangers in my apartment ...
... when i want to kick back with a puzzle ... beer , cold beer .
hey , joey . what are you doing ?
sweeping . why ? does it turn you on ?
no .
what if i was sweeping a chimney ?
joey , did you eat my face cream ?
where are you going ? the vicar won &apos;t be home for hours .
joey , where did you learn that word ?
where do you think ...
... zelda ?
you found my book ? !
yeah , i did !
joey , what are you doing going into my bedroom ?
i &apos;m sorry . i went in there to take a nap.i know i shouldn &apos;t have , but you got porn !
god ! i cannot believe you invaded my privacy like that !
zelda .
now , you seem a little tense . maybe you &apos;ll relax if i gave you a nice milk bath .
okay , you know what ?
i don &apos;t even like that part .
oh , i do .
you know what ? i don &apos;t care . i &apos;m not ashamed of my book .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica .
it &apos;s just a healthy expression of female sexuality ...
... which , by the way , is something that you will never understand .
you got porn .
hello .
hi , is phoebe here ?
no , she &apos;s out for the night .
oh , great .
can i help you with something ?
i don &apos;t know . are you a masseur ?
yes , i am .
great ! dad ?
thank you so much . i &apos;ll pick him up in an hour .
you need help with that ?
your parents must &apos;ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged .
oh , yeah . i should probably call them .
i remember when we first got engaged .
i &apos;ve never heard that story .
dad , you don &apos;t ...
well , i &apos;d gotten judy pregnant .
i still don &apos;t know how .
you don &apos;t know how ? your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy .
what a sweet story .
at least you &apos;re not hearing it at your fifth grade halloween party .
they wanted a scary story .
we &apos;re really excited about our wedding plans .
i guess pretty soon we &apos;ll be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund .
what ?
you tell her , jack . i can &apos;t do it .
you have the wedding fund , don &apos;t you ?
we have it . only , now we call it &quot; the beach house . &quot;
you spent my wedding fund on the beach house ?
we &apos;re sorry . we assumed ...
... that if you got married after 30 you &apos;d pay for it yourself .
you bought the beach house when i was 23 .
so you &apos;ve had seven years of beach fun ...
... and you can &apos;t put a price on that .
we do feel bad about this .
we saved again when you dated richard ...
... then that went to hell , so we redid the kitchen .
what about chandler ?
it was chandler . we didn &apos;t think he &apos;d propose .
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .
i can &apos;t believe there &apos;s no money for my wedding .
maybe , if your father hadrt tried ...
... to sell ice over the internet .
it seemed like such a simple idea .
stupid , jack . the word is stupid .
enough . i don &apos;t want to hear about it anymore .
good luck , chandler .
okay , now i &apos;m going to ...
... touch you .
that &apos;s soft .
why does joey keep talking about chimney sweeps and vicars ?
i thinks he &apos;s just been rehearsing for an episode of his show .
because it really sounds like a bad porn novel .
do you think your parents could help pay for it ?
i don &apos;t know .
my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding .
she &apos;s saving the rest for her divorce .
and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to ...
... dollywood .
what happened at dinner ? - my parents spent the wedding fund .
my god , what did you order ?
wait , there &apos;s no money ? well , this is terrible .
you guys are gonna have to get married in , like , a rec center .
oh , my god , you &apos;re right .
we &apos;re gonna have to be out by 6 so they can take out the floor for senior swim .
honey , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
no , it &apos;s not gonna be okay .
no swing band , no lilies .
no , but that &apos;s good .
you don &apos;t want lilies .
if a cat ate them , it would die .
what ? - i &apos;m just saying , now you could invite cats .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i mean , you don &apos;t need to have this ...
... rustic italian feast .
you don &apos;t need this custom @-@ made ...
... empire @-@ waisted , duchess satin gown .
you can wear off @-@ the @-@ rack .
it &apos;s really gonna be okay .
the important thing is that we love each other and we &apos;re gonna get married .
do you even understand what &quot; off @-@ the @-@ rack &quot; means ?
why don &apos;t you pay for it yourself ?
how ? i don &apos;t have any money .
well , i have some .
how much ?
well , close to ...
are you kidding me ? !
how much ?
enough for wedding scenario a.
really ?
scenario a has lilies . someone &apos;s gonna have to break it to the cats and it won &apos;t be me .
how great are you , you little saver !
this is exactly the budget of my dream wedding .
you guys are so made for each other .
you &apos;re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding ?
yeah .
look , mon , i &apos;ve been saving this money for six years ...
... and i kind of had some of it earmarked for the future , not just for a party .
hello , mr. chandler .
sweetie , this is the most special day of our lives .
i realize that , honey , but i &apos;m not gonna spend all the money on one party .
honey , i love you .
but if you call our wedding a party one more time ...
... you may not get invited .
we can always earn more money . we &apos;re only gonna get married once .
i understand , but i have to put my foot down . the answer is no .
you &apos;re gonna have to &quot; put your foot down &quot; ?
yes , i am .
money and a firm hand .
finally a chandler i can get on board with .
hey , rach .
joey .
hey , rach , do you smell smoke ?
i get it . smoke , chimney , chimney sweep . very funny . ha , ha .
no , no , i &apos;m serious . you don &apos;t smell it ?
something &apos;s on fire .
no , i don &apos;t smell anything .
oh , you know what ? it &apos;s probably just your burning loins .
hey , what are you guys talking about ?
nothing .
damn , this coffee &apos;s cold .
do you mind if i heat this up on your loins ?
you know , i cannot believe you told him . joey ...
so i guess you bought that book after we broke up .
yeah , i did , because i wore out my first copy when i was with you .
oh , yeah ?
well , when we were going out , i read tons of porno magazines .
what &apos;s up ?
ross , how could you do that to an old man ?
excuse me , ladies .
i &apos;m sorry ?
my massage client , arthur .
his daughter said some guy that worked for me ...
... gave him a really weird massage .
i gave him an extremely professional massage .
he said you poked at him with wooden spoons .
okay , so it wasn &apos;t a traditional massage .
but i did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks ...
... and i gently exfoliated him with a mop .
well , he &apos;s never coming back . you just cost me $ 80 a week .
this is your fault . you didn &apos;t move his appointment .
oh , it &apos;s my fault ? you didn &apos;t have to massage him .
you could &apos;ve sent him away .
you could &apos;ve not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back .
he said he liked that !
you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
dude , what are you massaging an old man for ?
his daughter was hot .
gotcha .
look , ross , i really need that $ 80 every week .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find another massage client , phoebe .
yeah , i &apos;m sure i will too . but until then , i &apos;m going to massage you every week ...
... for the price of $ 100 .
you just said 80 .
you want me to mess up your puzzle ?
a hundred it is .
hello , zelda .
who are you supposed to be ?
the vicar .
do you even know what a vicar is ?
like a goalie , right ?
look , that &apos;s enough .
the joke &apos;s over . i &apos;m sick of it .
you mean this isn &apos;t the sweet torment you &apos;ve been waiting all your life for ?
joey , i &apos;m serious , all right ? it &apos;s enough .
you make stupid jokes and sleazy innuendoes ...
... and it &apos;s just not funny anymore .
i &apos;m sorry . rach , i &apos;m sorry .
maybe i could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn .
all right , that &apos;s it . you wanna do it ? let &apos;s do it .
that &apos;s right . i wanna do it with you .
been trying to fight it , but you just said all the right things .
i did ?
yeah . oh , i &apos;ve been waiting so long to get on that body .
this body ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
come on , joey , sex me up .
you &apos;re starting to sound like the butcher &apos;s wife in chapter seven .
come on , now . don &apos;t keep me waiting . get those clothes off .
but i &apos;d keep that helmet on , because you &apos;re in for a rough ride .
i don &apos;t want to . i &apos;m scared .
listen ...
... l &apos;ve been thinking .
it &apos;s not fair of me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding .
i mean , you work really hard for that .
well .
well , you work for that .
look , i &apos;ve thought about it too .
i &apos;m sorry . i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .
you do ?
yeah , i &apos;m putting my foot down .
look , when i proposed , i told you ...
... that i would do anything to make you happy .
and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy ...
... then that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
you are so sweet .
what about the future and stuff ?
forget about the future and stuff .
so we only have two kids .
we &apos;ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .
have you thought about that ?
yeah .
how many kids were we gonna have ?
four . a boy , twin girls and another boy .
what else did you think about ?
well , stuff like where we &apos;d live , you know .
like a small place outside the city ...
... where our kids could learn to ride their bikes .
we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar ...
... and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .
we &apos;d have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t want a big , fancy wedding .
sure you do .
no .
i want everything that you &apos;ve just said . i want a marriage .
you sure ?
i love you so much .
i love you .
when you were talking about our future , you said cat .
but you meant dog , right ?
yeah , totally .
oh , good .
room temperature okay ?
excellent . is the music too loud ?
no .
good .
what the hell are you doing ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
were you expecting a traditional massage with the hands ?
fine .
