hello .
i &apos;m dr. sheldon cooper .
and welcome to sheldon cooper presents : fun with flags ,
the final episode flagtacular .
i knew it was coming . still scary .
now , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re thinking , &quot; the final episode ?
who will stand between us and flag ignorance &quot;
i know i was thinking that .
is this a show on flags or mind reading ?
but the truth is i can no longer balance a full @-@ time career ,
a popular internet show , and a girlfriend .
and he really does have one , you jerks on the comment board .
so as they say , all good things must come to an end .
after only 232 episodes .
233 if we include the one
somebody forgot to press record on .
you said you weren &apos;t gonna bring that up .
and you said you pressed record .
anyway , please sit back , relax ,
and join us as we take our final lap ...
... as indicated by the waving of this racing flag .
有些代表场上有慢速车辆 有些则是最后一圈
and , of course , white flags can also represent surrender ,
the stewards of gondor , and the japanese minamoto clan ,
日本源氏与平家大战时 一家白旗 一家红旗
but i &apos;m sure you remember that from episode 62,
&quot; white flags : who &apos;s wavin &apos; &apos; em and why &quot; &quot;
that was a good one .
it was so good .
you know , i thought cleaning out a dead professor &apos;s office
was gonna just be boring ,
but then i found his dentures
and realized it &apos;s also gross .
doesn &apos;t professor abbott &apos;s family want any of this stuff ?
i don &apos;t think he had a family .
that &apos;s rough .
i know .
you can spend your whole life working ,
and at the end all that &apos;s left are some papers in a box .
makes you think .
oh , well .
hey . hey , we &apos;re supposed to look through all this stuff
before we throw it away in case it &apos;s important .
i @-@ i did . it &apos;s all outdated or disproved .
i don &apos;t know . this old pen kind of proves gravity .
when i tilt it , her bathing suit falls right off .
oh , my dad used to have a pen like that .
i dated it all through sixth grade .
it still feels weird
just throwing away his work like this .
don &apos;t feel bad .
someday , someone will be throwing out your work , too .
that someone was sheldon , and the day was yesterday .
hey , look at this .
&quot; dear roger , to be opened upon your first great discovery .
love , mom . &quot;
wow , look at the date .
he saved this 50 years and never got to open it .
that &apos;s intense .
poor roger abbott .
roger abbott sounds just like roger rabbit .
roger abbott , roger abbott , roger rabbit .
oh , my god , leonard , i know he &apos;s dead ,
but try it . it &apos;s fun !
roger abbott , roger rabbit ...
penny !
oh , my rookie of the year .
oh , dan . my boss who didn &apos;t want to hire me
and now &apos;s a little hug machine .
oh , look at you . brand @-@ new and already the third best sales rep .
why don &apos;t you come over to my table .
yes . i &apos;ll be right there .
bernadette &apos;s just parking the car .
oh , good .
bernadette . cute , sweet ...
vicious little bernadette .
come on . she &apos;s not that bad .
oh , yeah ?
at the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson
for losing the three @-@ legged race .
i mean , he still calls her &quot; that mean kid with the big boobies . &quot;
i know she can be a little intense , but , i swear ,
she is so sweet once you get past all the ...
hey , what are you talking about ?
we were just talking about how much we love working with you .
isn &apos;t that right ?
dan ?
over the years here at fun with flags ,
we &apos;ve had an opportunity to learn , laugh , wonder ...
and , yes , even shed a tear or two .
like when you do a two @-@ hour fourth of july spectacular
and it doesn &apos;t get recorded .
how many times do i have to say i &apos;m sorry ?
how about 4,000 .
one for every domino i set up to make that american flag .
please enjoy these highlights .
crikey ! what flag do we have today ?
australia , mate !
and now it &apos;s time for the speed round of flag or not a flag .
flag . flag .
not a flag . flag .
i am crushing this .
say , betsy ross , what you working on ?
但缺乏足够的档案记载以佐证这一观点
i have no idea .
because the story of me sewing the first american flag
is unsupported poppycock .
then who did sew it , hmm ?
don &apos;t ask me .
i &apos;m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are ...
out to make a quick buck !
fancy a dip , my dear ?
i do .
wait , that purple flag indicates
that marine pests , such as jellyfish , are present .
wow , that flag is a lifesaver .
no .
this is .
stop looking at my legs .
not a flag . flag .
flag . not a flag .
flag .
crap .
when stuff like this gets me down ,
you know what i like to do ?
sing &quot; hakuna matata &quot; like an eight @-@ year @-@ old girl ?
意为 &quot; 不用担心 &quot; 或 &quot; 没有问题 &quot;
wrong , smarty @-@ pants .
it &apos;s &quot; everything is awesome &quot; from the lego movie .
look at these notebooks .
they &apos;re full of pages and pages of data .
he clearly spent years on this .
oh , it &apos;s just columns of random numbers . toss it .
well , but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him ?
what if ... what if this is the thing
that would &apos;ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne ?
maybe he didn &apos;t know what to pair champagne with .
strawberries , caviar , oysters . all good choices .
yeah , that look right there
is why people eat before they come to your parties .
this has to mean something .
well , there &apos;s no discernible pattern that i can see ,
but it shouldn &apos;t be too hard to run the numbers and check .
well , maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer .
sure . we could try multiple regressions
with varying physical and experimental constants .
oh , we could run a pattern @-@ matching algorithm
against well @-@ known unsolved physics problems .
ooh , it might be a substitution cipher .
we could start with basic cryptanalysis .
or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with .
oh , let &apos;s do that .
because you don &apos;t know how to do cryptanalysis , do you ?
i &apos;m not even sure if it &apos;s the right word .
so , dan , you have a grandson .
how old is he ?
seven .
oh , yeah . i remember him from the picnic .
he was the one crying like a wuss the whole time .
i heard he was being picked on by a mean kid .
just builds character .
like my dad said , &quot; nobody likes a crybaby
except their mommies and democrats . &quot;
i need another drink .
what &apos;s his problem ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe he didn &apos;t like the fact
that you called his grandson a wuss .
well , i didn &apos;t think you were supposed to say &quot; sissy &quot; anymore .
okay , look , i know what a good person you are ,
but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh .
what ?
i &apos;m , like , the sweetest person i know .
look at me . i should be in a tree baking cookies .
yes , but once in a while ,
people think you &apos;re a little mean .
oh , yeah ?
you one of those people ?
no . no , no , no .
i @-@ i think the cookie thing .
action .
welcome back .
our guest today is a returning fan favorite .
he puts the reading in your rainbow ,
the geordi in your la forge ,
and the kunta in your kinte ,
mr. levar burton .
thank you , sheldon . now , remember our deal ...
you do this , i delete your contact information .
while ...
while you watch me do it .
great . happy to be back .
well , since you &apos;re here ,
i &apos;d like to get your opinion on something .
in honor of black history month ,
i portrayed george washington carver
对美国有十分大贡献的一名黑人
in a loving tribute that my roommate called &quot; wildly racist &quot;
what do you think ?
hi . my name is george .
oh , hell , no !
you heard him , leonard .
no , it &apos;s not racist .
are we sure this is the place ?
the doorman said this is the right building .
i think if you &apos;re pulling up your pants ,
you &apos;re not a doorman .
who is it ?
uh , i &apos;m looking for a professor sharpe ?
hold on .
can i help you ?
hi . we &apos;re from the university .
we &apos;re trying to get some information about professor abbott .
we were cleaning out his office
and found these books full of numbers .
any chance you know what it is ?
yes , he was always working on this .
i was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system ,
maybe an updated version of hubble &apos;s law .
i keep seeing the number 90 repeating .
that could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy .
it &apos;s the number of calories in a yogurt .
that &apos;s his food diary .
really ?
yeah , he wrote down everything he ever ate .
he was convinced that calorie restriction
was the key to living forever .
does it work ?
seriously ?
well , he could have been hit by a bus . you don &apos;t know .
sorry it &apos;s not more interesting .
on the bright side , you didn &apos;t have to listen
to his stomach growl for 35 years .
so , was there anything that professor abbott worked on
during his life that came close to an accomplishment ?
to be honest , his research never amounted to anything .
oh . you were his colleague .
how did your research turn out ?
great .
hey , this is the apartment you get when you win a nobel .
well , you could be very frugal .
i &apos;m getting a little tired of everybody &apos;s sarcasm .
i &apos;m not a bully .
i mean , maybe i come off a little strong ,
but that &apos;s only because my dad raised me to be tough
and not to take crap from anybody .
no . that &apos;s fine ,
but there &apos;s a difference between being tough
and telling your friend her new pants
look like a saggy diaper .
i did say that , didn &apos;t i ?
yeah , you did .
i felt so self @-@ conscious , i had to return them .
where ? to babies r us ?
you &apos;re doing it again !
okay , sorry . can we just go ?
i feel like everybody hates me .
oh , come on , they don &apos;t hate you , all right ?
they &apos;re just a little intimidated .
all you need to do is show everyone
how sweet you really are .
i think i &apos;d rather go .
no , come on .
you are not going anywhere , all right ?
i am here for you , and we are gonna fix this together .
thank you .
even though your dress is ugly .
well , my little flag @-@ keteers ,
it looks like the last episode of fun with flags is at an end .
if i could ,
i would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole
意思是试试水 看看反应的意思
and salute you .
and if you touched the ground , burn you .
如果国旗被弄脏或要退役 得庄重处理 通常烧毁
i &apos;d like to take a moment
to personally thank dr. amy farrah fowler ,
who you may or may not know
is the first woman to co @-@ host a flag
or banner @-@ related internet info @-@ tainment show .
take that , glass ceiling .
and if i may get serious for a moment ,
hosting this show has been ...
one crazy ride .
with all its ups and downs ,
i wouldn &apos;t give it up for the world .
except for now , when i &apos;m giving it up .
before i sign off , i &apos;d , uh ...
i &apos;d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag .
it &apos;s good for times like this .
good night .
cut .
sheldon ...
that was beautiful .
if you didn &apos;t press record ...
i pressed it !
well , that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s the end of roger abbott .
and we still don &apos;t know who framed him .
i still keep thinking about how an entire life
can seemingly amount to nothing .
i guess the sad truth is ,
not everyone will accomplish something great .
some of us may just have to find meaning
in the little moments that make up life .
that &apos;s a nice way of looking at it .
yeah for you , not for me .
i went to space . i &apos;m covered .
you know what ?
this bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement .
let &apos;s make a pact .
when one of us gets their first big breakthrough ,
we &apos;ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne
and toasting professor abbott .
i love that .
yeah , me , too .
then , of course ,
rubbing our success in sheldon &apos;s face .
oh , well , that &apos;s the best part .
oh , yeah .
dan , could i talk to you for a minute ?
sure , go ahead .
just want you to know i didn &apos;t mean
to be rude about your grandson .
no , it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
penny told me that everyone &apos;s scared of me .
what ? what ?
why would she say that ?
you know she drinks , right ?
what ?
no , she &apos;s right , and i just want you to know
that from now on , i &apos;m gonna be much more sensitive .
i don &apos;t want anyone walking on eggshells around me .
oh , well , okay , then , uh ,
one thing i &apos;ve been meaning to tell you
is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee .
no problem . when does that start ?
five months ago .
what ? !
yeah .
who &apos;s been paying for my coffee ?
all of us .
yeah . it comes from the swear jar
we put money in when you curse .
what else don &apos;t i know about ?
uh , well , you know your private bathroom ?
yeah ?
that was supposed to be for the whole floor .
you &apos;re kidding .
no , no . it &apos;s okay .
it only really affected wheelchair kathy ,
and she &apos;s back in the hospital now ,
so it all worked out .
i feel so bad .
well , then , maybe you shouldn &apos;t have named her &quot; wheelchair kathy . &quot;
oh , my god !
i thought everybody liked me , but i &apos;m just a monster .
but a cute one , like that , uh , eyeball guy in monsters , inc .
no , i &apos;m the worst .
i &apos;m a terrible person .
come on , don &apos;t cry . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s not okay .
how can i even work here anymore ? oh .
because this company needs you .
it &apos;s fine .
we don &apos;t mind paying for the coffee .
i can &apos;t let you do that .
maybe we could get you
an espresso machine for your office .
i guess that would be all right .
all right .
see ? you don &apos;t have to be mean to get what you want .
you &apos;re right .
now where did we land on my bathroom ?
hi .
hello .
how come you &apos;re up so late ?
i posted the last episode of fun with flags hours ago ,
and not a single person cared enough to comment .
all that effort for nothing .
i know how you feel .
i spent the day throwing out a man &apos;s entire career ,
and all that &apos;s left is an old bottle of champagne
and a naked lady pen that raj took
when he thought no one was looking .
it &apos;s not the same thing .
i don &apos;t think you know how i feel at all .
sad ?
you do get me .
someone left a comment .
yeah . what did they say ?
&quot; too bad your show is done .
i kind of liked it . &quot;
leonard , did you hear that ?
oh , the people are heartbroken !
i can &apos;t take this away from the world !
fun with flags is back !
congratulations .
let &apos;s celebrate !
sheldon , that wasn &apos;t for you !
oh , no , i &apos;m not going to drink it .
i just wanted to hear the pop .
yeah , i knew it was coming . still scary .
levar burton ?
levar burton !
levar burton !
what are you doing here ?
you told me not to call ,
and i didn &apos;t know how else to give you the good news .
fun with flags is back ,
and you can be in the next episode .
wil wheaton said , get a gate .
i don &apos;t know why i didn &apos;t get a gate .
you ...
at least listen to the premise .
since you were born in germany ,
i thought we could talk about german flags .
how do you feel about dressing up like a swastika ?
