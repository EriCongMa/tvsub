pay it foward
and let me conclude
by saying that even though we &apos;ve been deemed
the city of tomorrow ,
this award says as much about bronson springs today .
i submit that there is no finer place
in this great country of ours to call home--
past , present , or future .
now , we &apos;ve got in mind--
we &apos;ve put together a little gift basket ...
a time capsule ,
to be opened in 25 years .
those people lucky enough
to call bronson springs home in 2013
will have a snapshot
of what made their city so special
way back here in 1988 .
ladies and gentlemen ,
we were voted the best in 1988
and we &apos;re still the best now .
ok , this is the moment we &apos;ve been waiting for .
plug your ears .
wow , look at that .
i have to say that as mayor
i &apos;m excited to see what the past will bring us .
let &apos;s open it up and see what we &apos;ve got .
sam , since you were sitting in the mayor &apos;s chair
when all of this started ,
it &apos;s only fitting you do the honors .
thank you . thank you .
so how many bags are in there , sam ?
we have 20 bags to open .
then let &apos;s do this while there &apos;s still sunlight .
all right , let &apos;s see what we have here .
floppy disks .
i see a lot of confused young faces out there .
hey , trust me , kids . floppy disks really did used to be floppy .
ok , now it &apos;s my turn .
oh , my god !
two days ago , the head that once belonged to
23 @-@ year @-@ old wade burke rolled out of a time capsule
in bronson springs , colorado ,
and i know--i know this is hardly news--
the video we are now watching
has already had 1.3 million views online .
we &apos;re being called in on a cold case ?
sadly , no , because as of two hours ago ,
the decapitation menu in bronson springs
has expanded to include both cold and hot selections .
it is hard to tell from this photo--
thank you , friendly universe--
uh , but the latest victim also does not have a head attached to him .
has he been identified ?
62 @-@ year @-@ old charlie figg
is a retired deputy from bronson springs .
his body was found next to his vehicle
on a remote road 30 miles east of town .
that &apos;s a lot of years in between .
is there any connection between the victims ?
nothing that jumps out .
wade burke was a clean @-@ cut honor student type .
graduated from college in 1988,
went to work at the family &apos;s carpet business .
charlie figg was already on the job working as a deputy .
it doesn &apos;t seem like their paths crossed .
and wade burke &apos;s body was never found .
well , is it realistic to think this could be the same killer ?
a 25 @-@ year dormancy period is highly unusual .
but not unheard of .
a number of serial killers have had long intervals of time between kills .
btk , jeffrey dahmer , the keystone killer .
jack the ripper and the zodiac killer
appear to have even stopped completely .
then again , there might be other victims we don &apos;t know about .
i don &apos;t know , my gut says copycat .
i mean , like garcia said ,
this time capsule thing &apos;s been all over the news .
and that video , what was it , 1.3 million hits ?
derek &apos;s right . that &apos;s exactly the kind of high @-@ profile notoriety
that could inspire an imitator .
whether it &apos;s one unsub or ten ,
bronson springs is getting a lot of attention .
and if the killer &apos;s feeding off of publicity ,
it &apos;ll only encourage him to strike again .
wheels up in 30 .
a memory is what is left when something happens
and does not completely unhappen . &quot;
edward de bono .
the removing of heads has an interesting history .
in medieval times it was considered
an honorable way to be executed ,
reserved for noblemen and knights .
lucky them .
that &apos;s not what killed our latest victim , though .
charlie figg died from a single gunshot wound to the chest .
the head was removed postmortem .
garcia , is this the entire case file
from wade burke &apos;s 1988 disappearance ?
that is not a garcia glitch , sir .
you &apos;re looking at all one page of it .
well , not much of an investigation .
apparently there was no suspicion of foul play back then .
well , given what we know now ,
will you look a little more closely into burke &apos;s background ?
yeah , already started working on it .
thank you .
bye .
it wouldn &apos;t hurt to look harder
into charlie figg &apos;s history either .
potential murderers aren &apos;t jumping off the page .
a second set of tire tracks were found off the side of the road
where charlie figg was killed ,
but they weren &apos;t able to pull a tread pattern .
he could have fallen for a ruse .
charlie figg &apos;s crime scene was right out in the open .
it &apos;s messy business removing a head ,
time consuming .
the trophy &apos;s obviously crucial to the unsub .
morgan , you and jj go talk to wade burke &apos;s mother .
reid , you and dave talk to the former mayor ,
see who had access to the 1988 time capsule .
blake and i will go see what we can find out about charlie figg .
and so the guessing game begins .
from what nook or cranny
will our new missing head roll out ?
you must be the fbi .
yes , sir . i &apos;m agent hotchner .
this is agent blake .
sheriff collier .
follow me this way .
we got you guys set up back in the conference room .
so this work for you ?
yes , this is fine .
uh , we could use a large case board if you have one ?
you can have every case board in the joint .
till we get the bastard that killed charlie ,
there &apos;s only one active investigation
going on in bronson springs .
who in the department knew charlie figg best ?
you &apos;re looking at him .
when i first joined , charlie took me under his wing .
he was like my father , my older brother ,
my best friend all rolled into one .
exemplary family man , just a stellar human being .
any idea what charlie was doing in the area where he was found ?
it &apos;s fairly remote .
charlie liked to hunt .
there &apos;s no law against that last i checked .
sheriff , i &apos;m not being antagonistic .
we &apos;re here to help you .
no , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . it just , uh-- --
you know those stages of grief you &apos;re supposed to go through ,
shock , denial , and whatever ?
well , i skipped past all that , i went straight to anger .
that &apos;s where i am and that is where i &apos;m gonna stay
until we get the son of a bitch who did this .
mrs. burke , we &apos;re so sorry about your son .
people have been calling me the past 3 days .
they all say that at least i have closure now .
all the times i &apos;ve walked across that courthouse lawn ,
now i know that wade was under there the whole time .
my little boy ...
buried in the ground in that metal tube .
my husband didn &apos;t get closure .
he went to his grave not knowing .
who &apos;s the lucky one ,
him or me ?
25 years ago ,
police felt that your son left on is own , voluntarily .
did you also believe that ?
yes .
the weeks before he disappeared ,
wade talked about leaving .
he wanted a change .
your son graduated with a degree in electrical engineering .
that &apos;s right .
but he worked for the family carpet business in sales ?
my husband was a good man .
but he could be ... controlling .
he wanted to keep wade close .
keep him close why ?
is there anything else ?
i &apos;d like to go now .
here &apos;s the list of names you asked about .
these are the 20 people who put a bag in the capsule ?
yes , sir .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna find any killers on that list .
grade school kids , local businessmen , pta types .
the name we need is whoever put the 21st bag in the capsule .
now , this is-- this is where we did it , right in here .
the bags went in , capsule got sealed ,
the next morning , took it outside and buried it .
forensics found the seal
had been cut and then carefully resealed .
the unsub must have broken into the courthouse the night before ,
cracked open the seal , and put in the head .
why wasn &apos;t the capsule guarded ?
it was a different world then , son .
back then , folks in bronson springs didn &apos;t lock their doors ,
kids rode their bikes after dark .
didn &apos;t occur to anybody the damn thing needed guarding .
hey , wanda .
sam .
this is , uh , agent rossi
and dr. reid of the fbi .
wanda sullivan is the editor of our local newspaper .
nice to meet you , and thank you for what you &apos;re doing for us .
i &apos;ve already looked through them .
nobody lurking in the background with a hatchet .
wanda here took these pictures .
she was just brand @-@ new at the paper back then .
is the fbi gonna be at the town meeting tonight ?
uh , yes , ma &apos;am .
do you think it &apos;s smart ?
people hear that the fbi is in town ,
they &apos;re gonna get scared .
no offense , but i think it &apos;s the head without the body
and the body without the head that has the people scared .
we &apos;ll just be there to answer questions ,
hopefully give some reassurance .
i think it &apos;s a mistake .
bye .
was it my cologne ?
don &apos;t take it personal .
we used to call her &apos; cyclone sullivan &apos; .
you know , back in &apos; 88,
once she got a whiff that bronson springs
was on the short list for &apos; city of the future award &apos; ,
she , uh--well ...
we were gonna win that sucker or else .
she made it her personal business
to keep the folks in this town in line .
how did she manage that ?
well , the first thing she did
was put a crime blotter type column in the newspaper .
every morning she &apos;d publish stories about people &apos;s run @-@ ins with the law .
shame the townspeople into good behavior .
yeah , that was the idea .
do you think you could get us copies
of those newspaper columns from that time ?
this could be someone holding a grudge .
you bet .
ah ... it feels like a different world .
sometimes i wish i could crawl back in that time capsule
and just ... put it in reverse .
well , you know what they say .
progress was a wonderful thing ,
it just went on too long .
hey , i got something .
so i dug deeper into our boy scout wade burke ...
and ?
not much a boy scout .
how so ?
how so is that while wade was away in college ,
he had 6--6 cases of public intoxication ,
including one involving a hit @-@ and @-@ run with a pedestrian in a crosswalk .
why wasn &apos;t any of that on his record ?
because daddy &apos;s big fat bank account comes with a big fat eraser ,
so anytime wade did something wrong ,
it just got swept under the rug .
no pun intended . get it ?
because the burke family business is rug manufacturing .
so carpet--sweeping it under the--
yeah , got it , garcia .
ok .
that would explain why his father kept him on a short leash .
thanks , morgan .
morgan says the m.e. confirmed that
it was the same saw that cut off both the heads
of wade burke and charlie figg .
so we &apos;re dealing with a single unsub .
wait .
you &apos;re saying the same guy killed wade burke and charlie ?
he just changed his m.o.
burke &apos;s body was never found ,
and charlie &apos;s body was left in a place
where it would be discovered almost immediately .
the killer wants to let everyone know he &apos;s back in business .
and he &apos;s shown preference for an audience .
the town hall meeting tonight .
well , maybe we better cancel it .
no , it &apos;ll be helpful to observe those who attend .
observe what ?
the guy &apos;s not gonna show up dragging a hacksaw behind him .
this is a killer who had the patience to wait 25 years .
that &apos;s uncommon .
and , sheriff , that distinctiveness
might show itself in other ways .
my kids are afraid to go out with their friends .
what am i supposed to tell them ?
we &apos;ll answer all of your questions
as soon as the meeting comes to order .
i &apos;m here now . can &apos;t i ask a simple question ?
it &apos;s ok , tom . we understand your frustration ,
but that &apos;s why we asked the fbi to help .
their top profilers are here .
what happens if another person gets their head chopped off
while they &apos;re busy profiling ?
sir , the best thing anyone can do is stay calm
and be vigilant .
the investigation is underway .
do you have any leads ?
nothing concrete , no .
but we are narrowing the parameters of the search .
hotch .
i got him .
that &apos;s why we are suggesting people travel in pairs
and make sure your doors and windows are securely locked .
this guy &apos;s cutting off heads .
do you think locking a window is gonna stop him ?
folks , during our question and answer period ,
everyone will be given a chance to talk .
please , try to hold your questions till everyone is present .
got him !
no , no , wait !
get your hands behind your back !
what happened ?
it &apos;s a joke !
come on , man , we were just messing around .
get up .
my buddies and me were drinking .
they dared me to come here and do this .
it &apos;s just a joke .
get him out of here .
everything &apos;s under control .
it looked like there could have been a head in that bag .
that &apos;s why i wanted you to hold off .
he was much too young to be the unsub .
if the real killer was going to show ,
you may have spooked him now .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , no , no , no , no . absolutely not .
i want you to write it up ,
then i want to bury it . ok ?
look , it &apos;s a fiasco ,
just like i knew it would be .
yeah , but we &apos;re not gonna throw more flame on the fire now .
look , just email me your copy .
i want to look at it before we publish tomorrow .
ok ? thanks .
hello , wanda .
he took her head .
the whole world &apos;s gone crazy .
sheriff , this wasn &apos;t random .
she was targeted and stalked just like the other victims .
who would do a thing like this ?
wanda sullivan was a big anti @-@ drug crusader , right ?
rossi said that &apos;s what the ex @-@ mayor told him .
well , they found that in her garden .
she was cultivating a nice patch of marijuana for herself .
guess she wasn &apos;t as squeaky clean as she appeared to be .
and wade burke was the perfect student
who turned out to not be so perfect .
maybe that &apos;s the connection .
the unsub &apos;s targeting people whose private lives
don &apos;t measure up to their public image .
we should take a closer
look to the private lives of all the victims .
thought i heard you in here .
hey . thought we had rules about coming into the man cave .
even when it &apos;s to announce your breakfast is ready ?
ok . special exemption .
hey , i &apos;ll be in in a couple of minutes .
ok .
did you know that guy ?
which guy ?
wade burke .
the one whose head was in the capsule ?
no .
why ?
you guys were just about the same age . that &apos;s all .
thought maybe .
no . paths never crossed .
you better come eat before your eggs get cold .
thanks .
agent hotchner .
jim here talked to wanda sullivan &apos;s neighbors--
sheriff , when you referred to charlie figg
as an exemplary family man ,
to which of his families were you referring ?
the family he kept here in bronson springs
that everybody knew about ,
or the second secret family he kept 3 hours east ?
jim , can you give us a minute ?
how &apos;d you find out about that ?
is there anything else you haven &apos;t told us about ?
nothing .
are you sure ?
really . nothing .
look , agent hotchner , charlie had some , uh ,
some issues in his personal life .
that &apos;s true .
but it didn &apos;t affect his work as a cop .
but it does affect our profile .
so you &apos;ve got a few minutes to prepare your officers .
they &apos;re going to hear some things they &apos;re not gonna like .
we &apos;re looking for a physically fit male
between the ages of 45 and 55 .
and he &apos;s targeting people that he perceives as hypocrites .
in the 1980s , wade burke won student citizenship awards ,
but in fact had significant ,
repeated brushes with the law that were covered up .
wanda sullivan was a fervent anti @-@ drug activist
yet secretly grew her own stash of marijuana .
and charlie figg broke the law that he was sworn to uphold
by illegally maintaining a second family .
this need to punish hypocrisy might have been triggered
when bronson springs was given the award as the perfect city ,
being held up as an example for the future .
if the unsub felt victimized
or that an injustice had been done to him ,
it might have motivated his need for revenge ,
not just against wade burke but against the entire city as well .
this person has extraordinary patience .
he put the head of his first victim in a time capsule ,
knowing that it &apos;d be 25 years
before people would know what he &apos;d done .
he always spends a great deal of time
meticulously planning his kills .
so look at professions that would reflect this type of mindset .
artisans , uh , those who work long hours in solitude ...
perfectionists .
how did this guy keep from killing all those years ?
we call it self @-@ initiated predation cessation .
most serial killers are unable to control their own impulses ,
but some seem to be able to self @-@ regulate .
it &apos;s like they have an on / off switch
that they themselves can control .
the secret of the head in the capsule
was probably enough to sustain him during this dormant phase .
and when the time capsule finally was opened ,
it was like an alarm clock going off ,
a wake @-@ up call to resume killing .
he witnessed the fear it instilled in the town
and he wanted to keep that panic going .
he &apos;s collecting heads again for a purpose .
we think the unsub is preparing for his next statement .
and this statement will be bigger and bolder ,
and he &apos;s not going to wait 25 years .
thank you .
bet you thought i forgot .
forgot what ?
our anniversary .
what are you talking about ?
our anniversary isn &apos;t until october .
i &apos;m talking about the anniversary of the day we first met .
22 years ago today .
you remember ?
i sure do .
i was a waitress in that little restaurant in pueblo .
you were the new fry cook .
dishwasher .
let &apos;s keep it honest .
talk about fate .
two kids from bronson springs
who grew up 3 miles from each other
had to go all the way across the state
to meet and fall in love .
must have been destiny .
that &apos;s exactly what it was--
destiny .
listen , i gotta go run some errands this morning .
i &apos;ll see you later on ?
morning .
morning .
they biting ?
ah , nibbling .
did manage to , uh ,
hook a good @-@ sized trout about an hour ago .
yeah ? where is it ?
oh , tossed it back .
catch and release .
is that the law ?
oh , more of a common courtesy .
keeps our lakes and streams full of fish for everybody .
that &apos;s nice .
except for the fish .
hook goes in your mouth , gets torn out ,
get tossed back ,
so somebody else can do the same thing .
you eat fish ?
sure .
me , too .
love fish .
healthy .
you cook &apos; em with the head on or off ?
usually on .
not me .
last thing i need
is some beady pair of eyes looking up at me
while i &apos;m trying to eat .
i always take the head off .
well , i think it &apos;s time for me to leave . uh ...
nice talking to you .
sorry , mr. backus .
when i catch , i don &apos;t release .
penelope garcia beaming in .
hey , throw me a bone , baby girl .
oh , lover , i &apos;m tossing you a 24 @-@ ounce tofu steak .
so i cross @-@ checked the newspaper crime column
with the sheriff dispatch records ,
and on the night of july 18 , 1988--
that would be one month before wade burke vanished--
a deputy responded to a possible sexual assault
on the 400 block of ferndale road .
now , 3 things are interesting about this .
one--the deputy that responded was charlie figg .
2--this incident and only this incident
was omitted from wanda sullivan &apos;s crime blotter column .
and 3--pregnant pause to ratchet up dramatic tension--
if you go down ferndale road half a mile ,
that &apos;s where wade burke worked at his family &apos;s carpet business .
we got another one .
todd backus , 72 @-@ year @-@ old widower , retired ,
lives by himself not too far from here .
who found him ?
local fisherman .
said the victim liked to come to this spot a lot .
this unsub has a confidence bordering on recklessness .
anybody could have witnessed this .
yeah , but nobody did , you know ?
not here , not on the county road with charlie figg ,
not at wanda sullivan &apos;s house .
this unsub &apos;s either very lucky or very good .
well , up until now ,
all of the victims in some way
circle back to wade burke and his family .
i wonder how ...
mr. backus here figures in .
tory ?
permission to enter man cave ?
if you want dinner tonight , you better let me in .
garcia , you have anything yet on todd backus ?
what i have is a frustration headache .
i love digging up dirt .
but ?
but it &apos;s like todd backus ...
he &apos;s never done anything wrong in his entire life .
he &apos;s originally from missouri .
he &apos;s been married happily to the same woman
for the last 45 years . 3 grown kids .
when did he move to bronson springs ?
let me see .
oh . 1988 .
april of 1988 .
a few months before wade burke disappeared .
oh my god !
oh my god .
i wish you hadn &apos;t seen that .
so we know the first three victims
were all directly tied to the sexual assualt incident
on july 18th 1988 .
but we don &apos;t know the identity of the person who was attacked .
it &apos;s a good bet it was wade burke committing the assault .
given his track record
and proximity to the burke family business ,
it had to be him .
charlie figg was the responding officer .
he was working patrol alone that night .
and wanda sullivan omitted mentioning it in her column .
ok , so where does todd backus fit in ?
baby girl , do we know why backus
came out to bronson springs in the first place ?
yeah , to seek employment .
he had lost his job in kansas city the year before .
did he find work ?
eventually he started punching a time clock again
by july 28 , 1988 .
10 days after the incident ?
that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
who hired him ?
he was hired at m.b. fabrics ,
and that is owned by burke carpeting . there it is .
wade burke &apos;s father gave backus a job .
where was backus living the night of july 18,
when the sexual assault happened ?
the first two weeks he was living in
like a temporary hotely type place ,
then his family joined him ,
they moved to a small apartment , 415 ferndale .
which is just down the road from where the sexual assault was reported .
backus witnessed it .
he called it in to the police .
and the job offer was to keep him quiet .
please , don &apos;t !
i &apos;m not going to hurt you .
i just can &apos;t have you messing this up after all i &apos;ve done .
i need to finish a few things and then we &apos;ll do it .
do what ?
teach this town a lesson they &apos;ll never forget .
no , please !
guys , i got another something .
wade burke &apos;s father was cooking the books at his business .
how so ?
july 21st , 3 days after the incident ,
he made a one @-@ time $ 30,000 payment to a clarence tipton .
he charged it off as a consulting fee .
do we know who clarence tipton is ?
yes , and the only thing he would be good at consulting about
is like welfare fraud and not getting employed .
the 30,000 was hush money .
clarence tipton and his wife arlene
moved out of bronson springs
shortly after all this happened .
i &apos;m shooting you their new address right now . there it is .
kirkwood ? that &apos;s less than an hour north of here .
that money come to us fair and square ,
and it &apos;s already spent ,
so you can &apos;t get it back
if that &apos;s what all this is about .
the money was a consulting fee .
that &apos;s right .
do you remember what business mr. burke was in
that he asked you to consult ?
the money we got had nothing to do with that .
arlene !
what the hell is the difference , clarence ?
practically everybody from then is dead now , anyway .
our daughter got raped by that boy .
wade burke .
yes .
and the money was part of the cover @-@ up .
they was gonna drag all our names through the gutter
if we went to trial .
she was only barely 16 .
after what that boy did to her ,
she had to take pills for depression .
i &apos;ll say it and i mean it .
i &apos;m glad that boy &apos;s head turned up like it did .
where &apos;s your daughter now ?
she moved to the other side of the state since she turned 18 .
we haven &apos;t heard one word from her since .
thanks to the price tag you and mr. burke put on her .
i don &apos;t have to sit and listen to this .
hold on a second .
i keep this hidden from my husband .
the son of a bitch would throw it away if he knew i had that .
this is your daughter ?
yeah . that &apos;s the only thing i have left of her to remember .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am .
we lost her that night .
lost her from our lives as if she &apos;d ...
been killed dead .
tory ?
tory , are you out there ?
no !
you need to settle , leanne .
you gotta trust me on this .
there .
that &apos;s better .
i located leanne tipton , who worked briefly
in a restaurant in pueblo in 1990,
but then she disappeared again later on that year .
so either she went way off the grid
or she changed her identity again , &apos; cause i can &apos;t find her .
so i &apos;m reattaching my snorkel and goggles ,
diving back in .
what &apos;s that ?
the rape case file from 1988 .
charlie had it at his house .
you knew it was there this whole time ?
no , ma &apos;am .
we all take home files now and then .
except sometimes charlie &apos;s files wouldn &apos;t come back .
i took a chance that maybe that &apos;s what happened this time .
his wife sandy showed me where he kept them .
this is the rape victim &apos;s statement .
sheriff , has this building
undergone any sort of renovations since 1988 ?
not really . it &apos;s been pretty much like this forever .
what are you thinking , hotch ?
the unsub knew everything that happened that night .
what was discussed and the people involved .
there were only 3 other employees working the station that night
and none of them are still alive .
maybe one of them told somebody .
not likely . a lie this big is too hard to maintain .
sheriff , where would the victim have given her statement ?
right over there where the deputy is standing .
and the accused wade burke , where would he have been held ?
in there .
was this area always used for storage ?
no , up till a couple years ago it was a temporary holding cell .
that &apos;s it .
the unsub didn &apos;t hear about the cover @-@ up , he witnessed it .
garcia , we need you to check
the crime blotter column for july 18th .
were there any other arrests made ?
uh , july 18th . july 18th .
there was a woman , for shoplifting . she was released .
there were two underage kids for alcohol possession .
they were picked up by their parents .
and there was one 22 @-@ year @-@ old male arrested for vandalism .
was he released ?
no , as far as i can tell .
he cooled his heels in jail overnight .
we need his name , garcia .
it was tory chapman .
he got in a lot of trouble with the law when he was younger ,
but then he straightened out .
where is he now ?
he lives at 228 brook street in grangerville .
that &apos;s a little town 15 miles south of bronson springs ,
and he makes furniture .
fbi !
it &apos;s clear here .
clear .
clear !
the place is empty .
someone was interrupted before they could finish .
he &apos;s on the run . it &apos;s a good bet he took his wife with him .
i &apos;ll get an apb out .
what do you got , rossi ?
he married her ?
tory chapman killed wade burke ,
then he must have insinuated himself into leanne tipton &apos;s life .
why ?
leanne must have presented as a victim
and he saw himself as a rescuer .
why did you kill wade ?
why ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
all this crap about the time capsule
and showing the future what a great place
bronson springs is in 1988 .
i wanted to give the folks in the future a real snapshot ,
one that isn &apos;t in their stupid chamber of commerce booklets .
please don &apos;t do this .
you were done a terrible wrong .
i am making it right .
tory , there &apos;s something about that night you don &apos;t know .
leanne tipton &apos;s statement about the rape--
it &apos;s off .
what do you mean ?
listen to this . &quot; he took me in the back room
&quot; and i was really , really scared .
&quot; i didn &apos;t know what was going on , and he--
&quot; he kind of put his hand on my throat .
&quot; then he started to , you know , take my clothes off .
&quot; i just tried to ...
and when he was finished , i ran . &quot;
what &apos;s off about that ? it sounds like a woman getting raped .
&quot; really , really scared &quot; is overselling .
&quot; kind of put his hand on my throat &quot; is underselling .
and she uses the word &quot; just , &quot;
which minimizes what follows ,
and down here , um , &quot; he started to take my clothes off . &quot;
and &quot; started to &quot; typically indicates
that what follows was interrupted .
this is a false accusation .
no .
tory ...
you &apos;re lying .
you &apos;re lying .
i was in love with wade .
and that night , we got into a fight .
and he--he ...
no , that &apos;s not what happened .
he ... he raped you .
he raped you !
my dad would have beaten me senseless
if he had known about wade .
i was so scared .
so i--i made up a story .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you were in love with him .
i wish my folks hadn &apos;t taken the money .
you took money ?
so what the hell was going on in here ?
garcia said he made furniture for a living .
engraving materials .
plates , fonts .
not typical for standard carpentry .
this is where we did it-- right in here .
bags went in , capsule got sealed ,
the next morning we took it outside and buried it .
aaron ...
i think i know where he &apos;s going .
step up .
what are you doing ?
tory , you &apos;re hurting me .
the busts in the display case
are judges , mayors , civic leaders .
chapman probably had to walk past them every time he went to court .
and if he felt that he and leanne were given a raw deal ...
no , no , no , no , please , tory , don &apos;t .
open your eyes .
no .
open them , or i &apos;ll open them for you .
oh , god .
i think i &apos;m gonna be sick .
what for ?
you &apos;re looking at bronson springs &apos; finest .
it takes a special kind of integrity to earn your way in there .
tory , please .
it turns out you were worse than any of them .
please don &apos;t .
please !
tory , please don &apos;t .
please don &apos;t ! please !
drop the weapon .
drop it now .
don &apos;t shoot . i &apos;m putting it down right here .
do it slowly .
cutting the heads off of people ?
only a crazy person would do that , right ?
and crazy people get released eventually .
i wouldn &apos;t count on that .
it may take 25 years , but i can do that .
25 years , that &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s only time .
&quot; there is no present or future ,
only the past happening over and over again now . &quot;
