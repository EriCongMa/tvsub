let &apos;s see , raj was the kung pao chicken .
i &apos;m the dumplings .
yes , you are .
creepy , howard .
creepy good or creepy bad ?
who was the shrimp with lobster sauce ?
that would be me .
come to papa , you un @-@ kosher delight .
i &apos;m not necessarily talking to the food .
sit over there .
sit over there .
baby wipe ?
why do you have ...
no , don &apos;t ask ! no , don &apos;t , don &apos;t !
i &apos;ll tell you why .
i had to sanitize my hands
because the university
replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms
with hot air blowers .
i thought the blowers were more sanitary .
really , don &apos;t. why ... ?
hot air blowers are incubators and spewers
of bacteria and pestilence .
frankly , it &apos;d be more hygienic
if they just had a plague @-@ infested gibbon
sneeze my hands dry .
hey , guys , i just got the most amazing
news ...
gosh , raj , do you think you &apos;ll ever be able
to talk in front of me without being drunk ?
okay , well , i &apos;ll just , um ,
go eat by myself .
penny , you don &apos;t have to do that .
oh , it &apos;s okay , between him not talking ,
him talking and him ...
i &apos;m better off alone .
good @-@ bye , you poor , strange little man .
she &apos;s so considerate .
so what &apos;s your news ?
remember that little planetary object
i spotted beyond the kuiper belt ?
oh , yeah , 2008 @-@ nq sub @-@ 17 .
or as i call it , planet bollywood .
anyway , because of
my discovery , people magazine is naming me
one of their 30 under 30 to watch .
raj ... congratulations .
that &apos;s incredible .
excuse me ,
30 what under 30 what to watch what ?
30 visionaries under 30 years of age to watch
as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields .
if i had a million guesses , i never would have gotten that .
it &apos;s pretty cool. they &apos;ve got me in
with a guy who &apos;s doing something about hunger in indonesia ,
and a psychotherapist who &apos;s using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners ,
and ellen page ,
star of the charming independent film , juno .
oh , i &apos;d so do her .
you &apos;d do the dolphins .
do i get an honorable mention for designing
the telescope camera mounting bracket you used ?
sorry , it &apos;s not part
of my heartwarming and personal narrative
in which a humble boy from new delhi overcame
poverty and prejudice
and journeyed to america to reach for the stars .
poverty ? your father &apos;s a gynecologist .
he drives a bentley .
it &apos;s a lease .
i &apos;m confused .
was there some sort of peer review committee
to determine which scientists would be included ?
peer review ? it &apos;s people magazine .
people picked me .
what people ?
the people from people .
yeah , but exactly who are these people ?
what are their credentials ?
how are they qualified ?
what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock
that &apos;s been traipsing around the solar system
for billions of years more noteworthy
than any other scientific accomplishment
made by someone under 30 ?
boy , i &apos;ll bet ellen page &apos;s friends
aren &apos;t giving her this kind of crap .
are you proud of yourself ?
in general , yes .
oh , there &apos;s my missing neutrino .
you were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge ,
weren &apos;t you , you little sub @-@ atomic dickens ?
hey , sheldon .
hey , look ,
look , i found my missing neutrino .
oh good , we can take it off the milk carton .
come on , we &apos;re going to apologize to raj
and invite him out to dinner .
apologize for what ?
he came over last night with some pretty good news
and we weren &apos;t very supportive .
i sense you &apos;re trying to tell me something .
you were a colossal asshat .
no , i beg to differ .
of the three of us , i was by far the most supportive .
really ? do tell .
how will raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him ?
when i was 11,
my sister bought our father
a &quot; world &apos;s greatest dad &quot; coffee mug
and , frankly , the man coasted until the day he died .
okay , let &apos;s try it this way .
what if this people magazine thing
is the best raj is ever going to achieve ?
i had not considered that .
come on .
i often forget other people have limitations .
it &apos;s so sad .
he can feel sadness ?
not really .
it &apos;s what you and i would call condescension .
now when we go in there ,
let &apos;s show raj that we &apos;re happy for him .
but i &apos;m not .
well , then fake it .
look at me .
i could be grinding on the fact
that without my stabilizing telescope mount
he never would have found
that stupid , little clump of cosmic schmutz .
but i &apos;m bigger than that .
fine .
what do you want me to do ?
smile .
oh , crap , that &apos;s terrifying .
we &apos;re here to see koothrappali ,
not kill batman .
try less teeth .
close enough. come on .
hey , raj .
hey , guys. what &apos;s up ?
we just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight .
to celebrate your &quot; 30 under 30 &quot; thing .
right , sheldon ?
that &apos;s very nice of you .
i would like that .
hello , boys. dr. gablehauser .
dr. koothrappali .
dr. gablehauser .
dr. hofstader. dr. gablehauser .
dr. cooper. dr. gablehauser .
mr. wolowitz .
boys , i &apos;ve got a question for you
who in this room
discovered a star ?
actually , 2008 @-@ nq sub @-@ 17 is a planetary body .
i &apos;m not talking about you , i &apos;m talking about me .
you , my exotic young friend ,
are my star .
but you didn &apos;t discover him .
you merely noticed he was here ,
much like he did with 2008 @-@ nq sub @-@ 17 .
sheldon ...
oh , sorry .
boy , we &apos;ve got to get you into a better office .
something more suited to your status .
really , you don &apos;t have to go to any trouble .
how about if i put you in von gerlich &apos;s old office ?
i &apos;d rather have fishbein &apos;s. it &apos;s bigger .
wait a minute , i called dibs on fishbein &apos;s office
the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe .
he gets a new office , i can &apos;t even get
paper towels in the men &apos;s room ?
sheldon .
damn , this is hard .
let me ask you something .
what do you think the business of this place is ?
science
money .
told you .
and this boy &apos;s picture in people magazine
is gonna raise us a pile of money taller than ...
well , taller than you .
i have a master &apos;s degree .
who doesn &apos;t ?
dr. koothrappali , have you ever had lunch
in the president &apos;s dining room ?
i didn &apos;t even know there was a president &apos;s dining room .
it &apos;s the same food as the cafeteria , only fresh .
come on , little buddy .
okay , big buddy .
see you tonight , guys .
you can stop smiling now .
so anyway , after a fantastic lunch ,
i was whisked off to the people magazine photo shoot ...
have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot ?
uh @-@ uh. no .
it &apos;s fantastic .
apparently ,
the camera loves me and i , it .
they shot me in front of
a starry background where i posed like this .
they &apos;re going to digitally add a supernova .
they say it &apos;s the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent .
right , a ball of hot , flaming gas
that collapses upon itself .
excuse me .
oh , it &apos;s my assistant , trevor .
go for koothrappali .
they gave him an assistant
if i want a new pen ,
i have to go to the bank with wire cutters .
have we at this point met our social obligations ?
not yet .
okay , just put it on my calendar ,
but start thinking of a reason why i can &apos;t go .
all righty ? koothrappali out .
god bless that boy .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without him .
you just got him this afternoon .
yes , but i &apos;m finding that having a lackey suits me .
a lackey ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry. is that politically incorrect ?
in india , we just call them untouchables .
now ?
almost .
speaking of untouchables , i &apos;ve got great news for you guys .
people magazine is having a reception this saturday
and i managed to get you invited .
oh , gee , thanks .
oh , you &apos;re welcome .
of course , i couldn &apos;t get you into the vip section
because , you know , that &apos;s for vips
and you guys are just , you know ... p &apos;s .
there &apos;s a tribe in papua new guinea
where , when a hunter flaunts his success
to the rest of the village ,
they kill him and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin .
superstitious nonsense , of course ,
but one can see their point .
here you go , raj .
you might want to drink this one slowly .
okay. so , saturday night , can i count on my posse ?
gee , i &apos;d love to , raj , but i can &apos;t make it .
oh , okay. leonard ?
no , i could ... no .
sheldon ?
i can make it. but i won &apos;t .
what are you guys talking about ?
there &apos;s a reception for my magazine article on saturday .
and you guys aren &apos;t going ?
i can &apos;t believe you .
raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment
and you &apos;re not even going to be there to support him ?
a tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered
were plummeting toward earth and he exploded it with his mind .
that would be cool .
i &apos;d go to that reception .
come on , this is huge .
raj is gonna be in people magazine ,
and he didn &apos;t even have to knock up one of the spears sisters .
would you like to go with me ?
of course i would .
i would be honored .
really ? cool .
shame on you guys .
look at that , i got a date with penny .
i can &apos;t believe it took you a whole year .
now ?
now .
hey , buddy ,
i &apos;m going to be in people magazine .
yeah , call me when you &apos;re on the cover .
look at you
i know . i &apos;m resplendent like the noonday sun , am i not ?
uh , yeah. starting with the champagne
a little early , aren &apos;t you ?
it was in the limo. they sent a limo .
i have a limo . i just love saying &quot; limo . &quot;
sip on this while you &apos;re getting ready .
oh , i &apos;m ready .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re wearing ?
um , yeah. why , what &apos;s wrong with it ?
nothing . i was just hoping for something a little more ,
you know , ridonkulous .
mm , yeah. well , this is all the donkulous
you &apos;re gonna get tonight .
okey @-@ dokey , let &apos;s roll .
all right , it &apos;s time to raise the roof !
hey , leonard .
hey. dude .
you look very nice .
thank you .
come on .
good night , leonard. good night .
hey , leonard , do you see my limo downstairs ?
yeah .
it &apos;s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in .
terrific .
it has more food , too .
all right , come on. come on .
hey .
hey , good news .
you don &apos;t have to sulk about penny anymore .
look , there are hundreds of croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them .
anything @-@ for @-@ a @-@ greencard.com ?
i &apos;ll lend you my user name .
it &apos;s &quot; wealthy big penis . &quot;
you &apos;re joking .
you gotta make it easy for &apos; em .
they &apos;re just learning english .
pass .
so you &apos;re just gonna sit around here and mope
while penny is out with dr. apu from the kwik @-@ e mart ?
it &apos;s not a date , and that &apos;s racist .
it can &apos;t be racist .
he &apos;s a beloved character on the simpsons .
let &apos;s just eat so i can get to bed .
with any luck ,
tonight will be the night my sleep apnea kills me .
did you remember to ask
for the chicken with broccoli to be diced , not shredded ? yes .
even though the menu description specifies &quot; shredded &quot; ?
yes. brown rice , not white ?
yes. did you stop at the korean grocery
and get the good hot mustard ? yes .
did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market ?
yes. thank you .
what took you so long ?
just sit down and eat .
fine .
all right , it &apos;s shredded. what do you want me to do ?
i want you to check before you accept the order .
sorry .
were you distracted by the possibility that koothrappali
might have intercourse with penny tonight ?
he &apos;s not going to have intercourse with penny .
then there &apos;s no excuse for this chicken .
you know , this situation with koothrappali brings to mind
a story from my childhood .
oh , goody , more tales from the panhandle .
that &apos;s northwest texas . i &apos;m from east texas ,
the gulf region , home to many vietnamese shrimpers .
do the shrimpers feature in your story ?
no .
anyway ,
when i was eight ,
a montgomery ward delivery van ran over our family cat lucky .
lucky ?
yes , lucky .
he &apos;s irony @-@ impaired. just move on .
okay , dead cat named lucky. continue .
while others mourned lucky , i realized his untimely demise
provided me with the opportunity to replace him
with something more suited to my pet needs
a faithful companion
that i could snuggle with at night ,
yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command .
so not a puppy ?
please , nothing so pedestrian .
i wanted a griffin .
a griffin ?
yes , half eagle , half lion .
and mythological .
irrelevant .
i was studying recombinant dna technology ,
and i was confidant i could create one ,
but my parents were unwilling
to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen .
of course , my sister got swimming lessons
when she wanted them .
sheldon , not that we don &apos;t all enjoy a good lion semen story ,
but ... what &apos;s your point ?
my point is if koothrappali is moving on
to a new life of shallow undeserved fame ,
perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort .
you want to breed a new friend ?
that &apos;s one option , but who has the time ?
but consider this-- the japanese ,
they &apos;re doing some wonderful work
with artificial intelligence .
now , you combine that with some animatronics
from the imagineers over at disney ,
next thing you know , we &apos;re playing halo
with a multilingual abraham lincoln .
sheldon , don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but you &apos;re insane .
that may well be ,
but the fact is it wouldn &apos;t kill us
to meet some new people .
for the record , it could kill us to meet new people .
they could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens .
and i &apos;m not insane. my mother had me tested .
if we do get a new friend ,
he should be a guy you can trust .
a guy who has your back .
and he should have a lot of money
and live in a cool place down by the beach
where we could throw parties .
he should share our love of technology .
and he should know a lot of women .
let &apos;s see , money , women , technology .
okay , we &apos;re agreed .
our new friend is going to be iron man .
welcome to the raj mahal .
it &apos;s very nice. good night , raj .
no , no , wait. the evening &apos;s not over .
yes , it is .
no , it &apos;s time to put on some r. kelly and suck face .
oh , wow , is the evening over ?
wait , wait , wait !
that &apos;s my mommy and daddy calling from india .
i want you to meet my parents .
wait. meet them ?
hello , mommy , daddy. good to see you .
how are you ? i &apos;m not drunk .
why would you say that ?
just making conversation .
mommy , daddy , i want you to meet my new squeeze , penny .
i &apos;m not your squeeze. there is no squeezing .
i can &apos;t see her. center her in the frame .
here you go. cute , huh ?
she &apos;s not indian .
so she &apos;s not indian. the boy is just sowing some wild oats .
no , no , no ,
there &apos;s no sowing , no squeezing and no sucking face .
what if he gets her pregnant ?
is this little hotsy @-@ totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren ?
what right do you have to pick with
whom i can have children with ?
look , rajesh , i understand you &apos;re in america .
you want to try the &quot; local cuisine . &quot;
trust me. you don &apos;t want it for a steady diet .
now you listen to me .
i am no longer a child
and i will not be spoken to like one .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to go throw up .
what &apos;s wrong with him ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it &apos;s the local cuisine .
okay , well , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
i &apos;m just gonna set you on down over here .
and i &apos;m gonna leave , so namaste .
and fyi , you &apos;d be lucky to have me as a daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
she is fusty . i like that .
raj , what are you doing ?
no , no notes .
if you have something to say to me , say it .
sorry .
