the game
they say a person either has what it takes to play
or they don &apos;t .
my mother was one of the greats .
me , on the other hand ... i &apos;m kind of screwed .
this is , uh ...
humiliating on so many levels .
you have to go .
why don &apos;t you come back here ,
and we &apos;ll pick up what we left off
no , seriously .
you have to go . i &apos;m late .
which isn &apos;t what you want to be on your first day
so , uh , you actually live here .
no .
yes. kind of .
it &apos;s nice . a little dusty ,
odd , but it &apos;s nice .
so , how do you kind of live here ?
i moved two weeks ago from boston .
it was my mother &apos;s house .
i &apos;m selling it .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
you said &quot; was . &quot;
oh , my mother &apos;s not dead .
she &apos;s ... you know what ? we don &apos;t have to do the thing .
oh , we can do anything you want .
exchange the details , pretend we care .
i &apos;m gonna go upstairs to take a shower ,
and when i get back down here , you won &apos;t be here , so , um ...
goodbye , um ...
derek .
derek .
right . meredith .
meredith .
nice meeting you .
bye , derek .
each of you comes here today hopeful ,
wanting in on the game .
a month ago ,
you were in med school being taught by doctors .
today ...
... you are the doctors .
the seven years you spend here as a surgical resident
will be the best and worst of your life .
you will be pushed to the breaking point .
look around you . say hello to your competition .
eight of you will switch to an easier specialty .
five will crack under the pressure .
two of you will be asked to leave .
this is your starting line . this is your arena .
how well you play ,
that &apos;s up to you .
like i said ...
... i &apos;m screwed .
辛苦的一夜
ok , martin , robinson , bond , hawkins .
only six women out of 20 .
yeah . i hear one of them &apos;s a model .
seriously , that &apos;s gonna help with the respect thing ?
you &apos;re cristina , right ?
patton , monroe ...
which resident are you assigned to ? i got bailey .
the nazi ? me too .
you got the nazi ? so did i .
at least we &apos;ll be tortured together , right ?
i &apos;m george o &apos;malley .
uh , we met at the , uh , mixer .
you had on a black dress
with a slit up the side , strappy sandals and ...
now you think i &apos;m gay .
no , i &apos;m not gay .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s just that , uh , you were ...
you were very unforgettable .
o &apos;malley , yang , grey , stevens .
and i &apos;m totally forgettable .
bailey ?
end of the hall .
that &apos;s the nazi ?
i thought the nazi would be a guy .
i thought the nazi would be a nazi .
maybe it &apos;s professional jealousy . maybe she &apos;s brilliant
and they call her a nazi because they &apos;re jealous .
maybe she &apos;s nice .
let me guess. you &apos;re the model .
hi , i &apos;m isobel stevens ,
but everyone calls me izzie .
i have five rules . memorize them .
rule no.1 : don &apos;t bother sucking up .
i already hate you . that &apos;s not gonna change .
trauma protocol , phone list , pagers ,
nurses will page you .
you will answer every page at a run. a run !
that &apos;s rule number two .
your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours .
you run labs , write orders , work every second night
until you drop , and don &apos;t complain .
on @-@ call rooms . attendings hog them .
sleep when you can where you can ,
which brings me to rule number three
if i &apos;m sleeping ,
don &apos;t wake me unless your patient is actually dying .
rule number four ,
the dying patient should better not be dead when i get there .
not only will you have killed someone ,
you woke me for no good reason ,
are we clear ?
yes ?
you said five rules. that was only four .
rule number five
when i move , you move .
get out of my way !
what do we got ?
katie bryce , 15 @-@ year @-@ old , female , new onset seizures ,
intermittent for the past week .
iv lost en route ,
started grand mal seizing as we descended .
all right , get her on her side .
izzie , 10 milligrams diazepam im .
no , no. the white lead is on the right .
righty , whitey , smoke over fire .
a large @-@ bore iv . don &apos;t let the blood hemolyze . let &apos;s go !
a wet fish on dry land ?
absolutely , dr. burke .
dr. bailey , let &apos;s shotgun her .
that means every text in the book
ct , cbc , chem @-@ 7 , tox screen .
cristina , you &apos;re on labs .
george , patient work @-@ ups .
meredith , get katie for a ct .
she &apos;s your responsibility now .
wait . what about me ?
honey , you get to do rectal exams .
what are you doing here ?
katie bryce &apos;s labs came out clear .
there &apos;s nothing in the results that explain her seizures .
i just thought you wanna know
ok .
uh , i heard every year , the attending
on @-@ call picks the best interns
and lets them perform a procedure during the first shift .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s what i heard .
go away ... now .
yeah , sounds good .
he &apos;ll be fine ? you &apos;ll be fine .
if you don &apos;t count the fact that
my bacon days are over , sure
so bypass surgery tomorrow with dr. burke .
i hear he &apos;s good .
and , after that , you can have all the
bacon @-@ flavored soy pa which you can eat
mmm. kill me now .
i wish i could , but i &apos;m a healer .
you &apos;re lost .
i &apos;m not lost . how are you feeling ?
how do you think i &apos;m feeling ?
i &apos;m missing my pageant .
you &apos;re missing your pageant ?
the spokane teen miss .
i was in the top ten after the first two rounds .
this is my year . i could have won .
you &apos;re so lost. what are you , like , new ?
ok , so i &apos;m just gonna insert my fingers
into your rectum .
no .
out . out .
bet you missed a lot when you first started out .
i twisted my ankle in talent rehearsal .
i do rhythmic gymnastics , which is , like , really cool .
nobody else does it .
and i tripped over my ribbon .
and i didn &apos;t get stuck with someone this clueless ,
and that was , like , a nurse .
you and i are gonna have so much fun together .
this shift is a marathon , not a sprint .
eat .
i can &apos;t .
you should eat something .
you try eating after performing 17
rectal exams .
the nazi hates me
the nazi &apos;s a resident .
i have attendings hating me .
you know meredith is inbred ?
like it &apos;s uncommon around here to be a doctors &apos; parents ...
royally in bread. her mother is ellis grey .
shut up. the ellis grey ?
who &apos;s ellis grey ?
the grey method .
where &apos;d you go to med school , mexico ?
she was one of the first big chick surgeons .
she &apos;s a living legend .
yeah , she won the harper avery twice .
so i didn &apos;t know one thing .
talk about parental pressure .
i &apos;d kill to have ellis grey as a mother .
i &apos;d kill to be ellis grey
all i need is one good case .
katie bryce is a pain in the ass .
if i hadn &apos;t taken the hippocratic oath ,
i &apos;d kevorkian her with my bared hands
what ?
good afternoon , interns .
it &apos;s posted , but i thought i &apos;d
share the good news peronally
as you know , the honor of performing the first surgery
is reserved for the intern that shows the most promise .
as i &apos;m running the or today , i get to make that choice .
george o &apos;malley .
me ?
you &apos;ll scrub in for an appendectomy this afternoon .
congratulations . enjoy it .
did he say me ?
i &apos;ve seen his file .
george o &apos;malley barely made the cut to get in this program .
he &apos;s not your guy .
he &apos;s my guy , all right .
every year , you pick your guy ,
and your guy suffers more than any other intern .
terrorize one , and the rest fall in line .
i get it , i respect it ,
but george o &apos;malley &apos;s a puppy .
katie bryce , 3604 ?
right there .
thank you .
katie , honey , mom and dad are here .
they gave her a sedative for the
ct scan , so she &apos;s a little groggy .
will she be all right ?
our doctor at home said that she might need an operation .
is that true ?
what kind of operation ?
she &apos;s , um ... well ... you know what ?
i &apos;m not the doctor .
um , i &apos;m a doctor , but i &apos;m not katie &apos;s doctor ,
so i &apos;ll go get him for you .
what ?
katie &apos;s parents have questions .
do you talk to them ,
or do i ask burke ?
no , burke &apos;s off the case .
katie belongs to the new attending now ,
dr. shepherd . he is over there
meredith , can i talk to you for a second ?
actually , i was ...
dr. shepherd .
dr. shepherd ? this morning , it was derek .
now it &apos;s dr. shepherd .
dr. shepherd . we should pretend it never happened .
what never happened ? you sleeping with me ,
or you throwing me out this morning ?
both are memories i &apos;d like to hold onto .
no , there will be no memories .
i &apos;m not the girl in the bar anymore ,
and you &apos;re not the guy .
this can &apos;t exist . you get that , right ?
you took advantage of me , and you wanna forget about it .
i did not take ...
i was drunk and vulnerable and good @-@ looking .
you took advantage .
ok , i was the one who was drunk ,
and you are not that good looking .
maybe not today .
last night , i was good @-@ looking . i had my red shirt on .
you took advantage .
i did not take advantage .
want to take advantage again ? friday night ?
no .
you &apos;re an attending and i &apos;m your intern .
stop looking at me like that .
like what ?
like you &apos;ve seen me naked .
dr. shepherd , this is inappropriate .
has that ever occurred to you ?
open , identify , ligate ,
remove , irrigate , close .
open , identify , ligate ,
remove , irrigate , close .
he &apos;s gonna faint . a fainter .
no , code brown , righ his pants .
he &apos;s about the flop sweat .
he &apos;s gonna sweat himself unsterilized .
ten bucks , he messes up the mcburney .
fifteen , he cries .
i &apos;ll put 20 on a total meltdown .
fifty says he pulls the whole thing off .
that &apos;s one of us down there , the first one of us .
where &apos;s your loyalty ?
75 says he can &apos;t even id the appendix .
i &apos;ll take that accurately
ok , o &apos;malley , let &apos;s see what you can do .
here it comes .
scalpel .
scalpel .
that burke is trouble .
more pressure .
the human flesh is a tough shell . dig in .
pickups .
pickups .
clamp .
clamp .
i &apos;m there .
damn , he got the peritoneum open . i &apos;m out .
i told you. he &apos;s gonna pull it off .
scalpel .
scalpel .
appendix is out .
not bad .
thank you .
now all you have to do
is invert the stump into the cecum
and simultaneously pull up on the purse strings ,
but be careful not to ...
... break them .
you ripped the cecum . you &apos;ve got a bleeder .
you &apos;re filling with stool . what do you do ?
think .
you start the suction and you start digging
for those strings before she bleeds to death .
give him a clamp .
bp &apos;s dropping .
he &apos;s choking .
come on , george .
today. pull your balls out of your back pocket .
let &apos;s go . what are you waiting for ? suction .
getting too low , folks .
dr. burke .
get out of the way . pansy @-@ ass idiot .
get him out of here .
suction. clamp .
he &apos;s 007 .
007 , yep .
a total 007 .
what &apos;s &quot; 007 &quot; mean ?
license to kill .
they &apos;re calling me 007 , aren &apos;t they ?
no one &apos;s calling you 007 .
right on the elevator , murphy whispered , &quot; 007 . &quot;
how many times do we have to go through this ? george
five ? ten ?
give me a number , or i &apos;m gonna hit you .
murphy whispered 007 , everyone laughed .
he wasn &apos;t talking about you .
are you sure ?
would we lie to you ?
yes .
007 is a state of mind .
says the girl
who finished first in her class at stanford .
oh , man . it &apos;s 911 for katie bryce .
i got to go .
maybe i should have gone into geriatrics .
no one minds when you kill an old person .
surgery is hot . it &apos;s the marines .
it &apos;s macho . it &apos;s hostile . it &apos;s hardcore .
geriatrics is for freaks who live with
their mothers and never have sex .
i &apos;ve got to get my own place .
excuse me ! excuse me !
took you long enough .
you &apos;re ok ? the nurse paged me 911 .
i had to go all exorcist to get
her to even pick up the phone .
wait . there &apos;s nothing wrong with you ?
i &apos;m bored .
you little ...
i &apos;m not a cruise director .
you don &apos;t have to wig out .
the pageant &apos;s on cable ,
but this crappy hospital doesn &apos;t get the channel .
if that cow kylie wood is gonna walk
off with my crown , i have to see it .
can you call someone ?
ok . this is an actual hospital .
there are sick people here .
go to sleep and stop wasting my time .
but i can &apos;t sleep . my head &apos;s all full .
that &apos;s called &quot; thinking . &quot; go with it .
what do you need ?
mr. jones has junky veins ,
and he really needs antibiotics .
i should start a central line .
so start one .
you don &apos;t know how .
i &apos;ve never done one .
well , you know what that means .
can &apos;t we just page someone else ?
she &apos;s the on @-@ call resident .
ok .
ok , i &apos;ll just ... i &apos;ll wake her .
dr. bailey , i don &apos;t mean to bother you .
then don &apos;t .
it &apos;s mr. jones .
is he dying ?
no .
then stop talking to me .
what is it ? !
next time you wake me ,
he better be so close to dead there &apos;s a tag on his toe .
4 @-@ b &apos;s got post @-@ op pneumonia .
let &apos;s start antibiotics .
are you sure that &apos;s the right diagnosis ?
well , i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m only an intern .
why don &apos;t you go spend four years in med school
and then let me know if it &apos;s the right diagnosis ?
she &apos;s short of breath . she &apos;s got fever .
she &apos;s post @-@ op . start the antibiotics .
god , i hate nurses .
i &apos;m alex . i &apos;m with jeremy .
you &apos;re with the nazi , right ?
she may not have pneumonia , you know .
she could be splinting , or have a p.e.
like i said , i hate nurses .
what did you just say ?
did you just call me a nurse ?
well , if the white cap fits .
damn it , katie .
is she seeing anybody ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s hot .
i &apos;m friends with her .
i mean , kind of friends ...
not actually friends exactly ,
but we &apos;re tight , and we hang out .
really , only just today ...
dude. dude , stop talking .
what took you so long ?
she &apos;s having multiple grand mal seizures .
now , how do you want to proceed ?
dr. grey , are you listening to me ? !
she &apos;s got diazepam , two milligrams lorazepam .
i just gave the second dose .
dr. grey , you need to tell us what you want to do .
dr. grey !
ok , she &apos;s full on lorazepam ?
she &apos;s had four milligrams .
you paged dr. bailey and dr. shepherd ?
lorazepam &apos;s not working .
phenobarbital . load her with phenobarbital .
pheno &apos;s in .
no change .
you paged dr. shepherd .
i just told you .
well , page him again , stat .
what do you want to do ?
dr. grey , you need to tell us what you want to do .
heart stopped .
code blue !
code blue ! code blue !
get the crash cart .
i &apos;ll get it , right away .

i see sinus rhythm .
blood pressure &apos;s coming up .
all right .
pressure &apos;s returning . rate &apos;s coming back .

she had a seizure and her heart stopped .
you &apos;re supposed to be monitoring her .
i checked on her , and she ...
i got her . just ... just go .
somebody give me her ... give me her chart , please .
you get a 911 , you page me immediately .
not in the five minutes it takes you
to get to the emergency , immediately .
you &apos;re on my team
and if somebody dies , it &apos;s my ass .
you hear me , grey ?
meredith ?
if you tell anyone , ever ...
you said it was a seizure disorder .
now you &apos;re saying it isn &apos;t ?
i &apos;m saying that i don &apos;t know .
what do you think it could be ?
i don &apos;t know .
when will you know ?
i don &apos;t have an answer for you for now .
katie is stable , and ...
wait one damn minute .
we came here because this hospital
is supposed to be the best in washington .
that &apos;s my kid in there . my kid .
and you have the audacity to stand here and tell me ,
&quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
mr. bryce ...
no , i want someone else , a doctor who knows what they &apos;re doing .
you get me someone else , someone better than you .
mr. bryce , i ensure you
i am working hard on katie &apos;s case .
no , you &apos;re not . if you were ,
you &apos;d be able to give me some answers .
i put you on a bypass machine ,
which pumps blood for your heart .
fix your ticker , take you off the machine .
i &apos;m done . simple procedure .
so i shouldn &apos;t worry ?
i &apos;m very good at what i do .
it still is surgery . there are some risks .
i &apos;ll see you in the or this afternoon , mr. savitch .
you &apos;re not gonna leave me alone with that guy , are you ?
oh , i &apos;ll be outside the or the whole time .
no , dr. burke is very good . don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll see you after .
he &apos;ll be fine , right ?
tony &apos;s gonna sail through it .
look , you have nothing to worry about . it &apos;s a promise .
gotta go .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m suturing a banana
with the vain hope that it wakes up my brain .
what are you smiling at , 007 ?
i &apos;m sorry . i get mean when i &apos; m tired .
you know what ? i don &apos;t care .
i comforted a family , and i got to hang out in the or today .
all is well .
anybody know why we &apos;re here ? so anybody ...
good morning .
morning .
morning .
i &apos;m gonna do something pretty rare for a surgeon .
i &apos;m gonna ask interns for help .
i &apos;ve got this kid , katie bryce .
right now , she &apos;s a mystery .
she doesn &apos;t respond to our meds .
labs are clean , scans are pure .
but she &apos;s having seizures-- grand mal seizures-- with no visible cause .
she &apos;s a ticking clock .
she &apos;s gonna die if i don &apos;t make a diagnosis ,
which is where you come in .
i can &apos;t do it alone .
i need your extra minds , extra eyes .
i need you to play detective .
i need you to find out why katie &apos;s having seizures .
i know you &apos;re tired . you &apos;re busy .
you got more work than you could possibly handle .
i understand . so i &apos;m gonna give you an incentive .
whoever finds the answer rides with me .
katie needs surgery .
you &apos;ll get to do what no interns get to do .
scrub in to assist on an advanced procedure .
dr. bailey &apos;s gonna hand you katie &apos;s chart .
the clock is ticking fast , people .
if we &apos;re gonna save katie &apos;s life , we have to do it soon .
did you just page me ?
yes . 4 @-@ b &apos;s still short of breath .
give antibiotics time to work .
the antibiotics should have worked by now .
she &apos;s old . she &apos;s freaking antient .
she &apos;s lucky she &apos;s still breathing .
i got a shot to scrub in downstairs
on a patient who wasn &apos;t alive during the civil war .
don &apos;t page me again .
hey , i want in on shepherd &apos;s surgery .
you &apos;ve been the intern on katie since the start .
you want to work together ?
we find the answer , we have a 50 @-@ 50 chance of scrubbing in .
i &apos;ll work with you ,
but i don &apos;t want in on the surgery . you can have it .
are you kidding ? it &apos;s the biggest opportunity any intern will get .
i don &apos;t want to spend any more time with shepherd than i have to .
what do you have against shepherd ?
if we find the answer , the surgery &apos;s yours .
do you want to work together or not ?
deal .
she doesn &apos;t have anoxia , renal failure or acidosis .
it &apos;s not a tumor , her ct &apos;s clean .
are you serious not gonna tell me why you won &apos;t work with shepherd ?
no . what about infection ?
no , there &apos;s no white count .
she has no ct lesions , no fevers ,
nothing in her spinal tap .
just tell me .
you can &apos;t comment , make a face or react in any way .
we had sex .
what about an aneurysm ?
no blood on the ct and no headaches .
ok . there &apos;s no drug use , no pregnancy , no trauma .
was he good ?
i mean , he looks like he &apos;d be good . was it any good ?
we &apos;re out of answers .
what if no one comes up with anything ?
you mean , what if she dies ?
yeah .
this is gonna sound really bad ,
but i really want the surgery .
she &apos;s just never gonna get the chance to turn into a person .
the sum total of her existence
will be almost winning miss teen whatever .
you know what her pageant talent is ?
they have talent ?
rhythmic gymnastics .
oh , come on .
what is rhythmic gymnastics ?
i can &apos;t even say it . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i think it &apos;s something with a ball and a ...
what ?
meredith , what ?
get up . come on .
the only thing that she would possibly need is an angiogram .
oh . oh , dr. shepherd , just one moment .
katie competes in beauty pageants .
i know that , but we have to save her life anyway .
she has no headaches , no neck pain , her ct is clean .
there &apos;s no medical proof of an aneurysm ,
but what if she has an aneurysm anyway ?
there are no indicators .
but she twisted her ankle a few weeks ago when she prepared for the pageant .
i appreciate you trying to help ...
she fell .
when she twisted her ankle , she fell .
it was no big deal , not even a bump on the head .
she got up , iced her ankle , and everything was fine .
it was a fall so minor ,
her doctor didn &apos;t even think to mention it
when i was taking her history , but she did fall .
you know what , the chance a minor fall can burst aneurysm is
one in a million , literally .
let &apos;s go .
where ?
to find out if katie &apos;s one in a million .
i &apos;ll be damned .
there it is .
it &apos;s minute , but it &apos;s there .
it &apos;s a subarachnoid hemorrhage .
she &apos;s bleeding into her brain .
she could have gone through her entire
life without it ever been a problem
one tap in the right spot ...
it exploded .
exactly
now i can fix it . you two did great work .
love to stay and kiss your ass , but i got to tell
katie &apos;s parents she &apos;s having a surgery .
katie bryce &apos;s chart , please .
here you go .
dr. shepherd , you &apos;d said that you &apos;d
pick someone to scrub in if we helped
oh , yes , right .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t take you both . it &apos;s gonna be a full house .
meredith , i &apos;ll see you in or .
good . thank you .
cristina ...
wow , that was quick .
his heart had too much damage for a bypass .
i had to let him go .
it happens , rarely , but it does happen .
the worst part of the game .
but i told his wife
i told gloria that he would be fine .
i promised her that ...
you what ?
they have four little girls .
you are not promising anything .
this is my case . did you hear me promise ?
the only one that can keep a promise like that is god ,
and i haven &apos;t seen him holding a scalpel lately .
you never promise a patient &apos;s family a good outcome !
i thought ...
you are a important man to make promises to mrs. savitch ?
you get to be the one to tell her that she &apos;s a widow .
izzie .
maybe meredith couldn &apos;t
izzie .
i &apos;ll tell him i changed my mind .
don &apos;t do me any favors . it &apos;s fine .
cristina ...
you know what , you did a cutthroat thing . deal with it .
don &apos;t come to me for abslotion .
you want to be a shark , be a shark .
i &apos;m not ...
oh , yes you are .
only it makes you feel all bad in your warm , gooey places .
no , screw you .
i don &apos;t get picked for surgery cause i slept with my boss
and i didn &apos;t get into med school cause
i have a famous mother .
some of us have to earn what we get .
gloria , there were complications in the surgery .
tony &apos;s heart had a lot of damage .
we tried to take him off bypass , but ...
there wasn &apos;t anything we could have done .
what are you talking about ?
he ...
tony died .
he &apos;s dead .
gloria ...
i am so sorry .
thank you .
please ...
go away .
i promised i &apos;d make her look cool .
apparently being a bald beauty queen is the worst thing
that happened in the history of the world .
did you choose me for the surgery because i slept with you ?
yes .
i &apos;m kidding .
i &apos;m not gonna scrub in for surgery .
you should ask cristina . she really wants it .
you &apos;re katie &apos;s doctor . and on your first day ,
with little training , you helped save her life .
you earned the right to follow her case through the finish
you shouldn &apos;t let the fact that we had sex
get in the way of you taking your shot .
i wish i wanted to be a chef
or a ski instructor or a kindergarten teacher .
you know , i would have been a really good postal worker .
i &apos;m dependable .
you know , my parents tell everyone that
they made up their son a surgeon
as if it &apos;s a big accomplishment .
superhero or something .
if they could see me now .
when i told my mother i wanted to go to medical school ,
she tried to talk me out of it .
said i didn &apos;t have what it takes to be a surgeon ,
that i &apos;d never make it .
so the way i see it ,
superhero sounds pretty damn good .
we &apos;re gonna survive this , right ?
she &apos;s still short of breath .
did you get an abg or a chest film ?
oh , yes , sir , i did .
and what did you see ?
i had a lot of patients last night .
name the common causes of post @-@ op fever .
from your head , not from a book .
don &apos;t look it up . learn it . it should be in your head .
name the common causes of post @-@ op fever .
uh ... the common causes of post ...
can anybody name the common causes of post @-@ op fever ?
wind , water , wound , walking , weird drugs .
the five w &apos;s .
most of the time , it &apos;s wind , splinting or pneumonia .
pneumonia &apos;s easy to assume ,
especially if you &apos;re too busy to do the test .
what do you think &apos;s wrong with 4 @-@ b ?
the fourth w , walking .
i think she &apos;s a prime candidate for a pulmonary embolus .
how would you diagnose ?
spiral ct , vq scan ,
provide o2 , dose with heparin
and consult for an ivc filter .
do exactly as she says ,
then tell your resident that i want you off this case .
i &apos;d know you anywhere . you &apos;re the speeding image of your mother .
welcome to the game .
all right , everybody . it &apos;s a beautiful night to save lives .
let &apos;s have some fun .
i can &apos;t think of any one reason why i want to be a surgeon
but i can think of 1,000 reasons why i should quit .
they make it hard on purpose .
there are lives in our hands .
there comes a moment when it &apos;s more than just a game ...
and you either take that step forward
or turn around and walk away .
i could quit , but here &apos;s the thing
i love the playing field .
it was a good surgery .
yeah .
we don &apos;t have to do that thing
where i say something and then you say something ,
and then somebody cries , and there &apos;s a moment .
yuck .
good .
you should get some sleep . you look like crap .
i look better than you .
that &apos;s not possible .
that was amazing .
you practice on cadavers ,
you observe
and you think you know what you &apos;re gonna feel like
standing over that table , but ...
that was such a high .
i don &apos;t know why anybody does drugs .
i should , uh , go do this .
you should .
i &apos;ll see you around .
see you around .
see you .
so ...
i made it through my first shift .
we all did .
the other interns are all good people .
you &apos;d like them ...
i think .
i don &apos;t know , maybe .
i like them .
oh , and i changed my mind .
i &apos;m not gonna sell the house . i &apos;m gonna keep it .
i &apos;ll have to get a couple of roommates , but
it &apos;s home , you know ?
are you the doctor ?
no .
i &apos;m not your doctor , but i am a doctor .
what &apos;s your name ?
it &apos;s me , mom . meredith .
all right .
i used to be a doctor , i think .
you were a doctor , mom .
