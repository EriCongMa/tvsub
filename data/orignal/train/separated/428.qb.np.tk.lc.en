i got her !
no , no , no . no , emily .
stay with me . come on , stay with me .
where &apos;s my medic ? !
she never made it off the table .
i didn &apos;t get a chance to say good @-@ bye .
passports from 3 different countries
and a bank account in each one
to keep you comfortable .
thank you .
good luck .
penelope , you gotta stop staring at her .
i can &apos;t help it .
so i came in here to do what ?
talk about losing emily ?
strauss put you up to this ?
the assessment &apos;s routine .
i asked her to let me do it
rather than bring in somebody from the outside .
so let me guess-- it &apos;s about the 5 stages of grief .
you want to figure out where we all are . hmm ?
all right .
denial . i &apos;m fine ,
this can &apos;t be happening to me .
well , it didn &apos;t happen to me , did it ?
so that rules that out .
what else is there ?
bargaining .
depression .
acceptance .
well , obviously i haven &apos;t accepted it ,
otherwise i wouldn &apos;t be in here .
so where does that leave me ?
angry .
angry .
yeah .
yeah , sometimes i feel like i want to quit my job
and spend my time chasing down
the son of a bitch who killed emily .
you &apos;re damn right i &apos;m angry .
please ... no , you gotta let me go .
let me out of here , please .
please let me go ! why aren &apos;t you listening to me ?
why aren &apos;t you listening to me ?
i need you to try and stay still .
can i get someone over here to help me ?
hold down her legs . i need a full injection of ...
i need you to try and take a deep breath .
no ! no !
hi , how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
hi .
i &apos;d like to buy a gun .
what are you looking for ?
a .38 ?
um , the kind that spins .
a revolver .
yeah
ok .
this one here produces little recoil .
good for target @-@ shooting and personal defense .
here , check it out .
i &apos;ll take it .
ok .
do you have a gun license ?
no .
well , how about a permit ?
you know , there &apos;s a mandatory 3 @-@ day waiting period
on all handgun purchases .
3 days ?
state law .
here .
fill this out ,
and i &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
ok ?
hi , how you doing ?
yeah , i have that .
no , it &apos;s got a good sweep , back up .
what are you doing ?
a deadly chain of events to report to you today .
approximately 45 minutes ago ,
4 people were shot to death
in a gun shop on west waters street .
tampa p.d. are calling this mass murder &quot; unprecedented . &quot;
a woman went in there and just shot up the place ?
yeah , witnesses heard gunshots
and saw a woman leaving the store .
is there enough for a sketch ?
family @-@ owned business . no cameras .
the only thing of value the witnesses said
was that she seemed really calm .
like an office or school shooter .
did she work there ?
no . local police have already ruled that out .
then she must have known one of her victims .
i doubt this was random .
you know , klebold and harris
documented their hatred
of the athletes at columbine ,
but on the day , they targeted the cafeteria
instead of the gymnasium because they were only interested
in obtaining the highest possible body count .
these offenders usually hole up
in one location and eventually commit suicide ,
either by their own hand
or in a shootout with police .
but this woman took off before the cops arrived .
she &apos;s probably not finished .
this little light of mine
i &apos;m gonna let it shine
this little light of mine
i &apos;m gonna let it shine
i get it . we &apos;re a family , and it &apos;s important
that families talk , and holding it in will just make
this sick , sad feeling of awfulness more awful .
right ?
internalizing does make it worse .
i &apos;ll talk , but i don &apos;t want to talk about her being gone .
can i talk about how she made me smile ?
of course .
ok .
poet antonio porchia wrote ,
&quot; man , when he does not grieve ,
hardly exists . &quot;
larry connors , born and raised in tampa .
he &apos;s owned the gun store for 16 years .
seaver , what did you find out about victimology ?
they &apos;re all locals with similar backgrounds .
blue collar jobs , they &apos;re all divorced ,
and they &apos;ve all got tempers .
most of them have misdemeanor bar fights on their record .
testosterone @-@ fueled victims ,
but somehow she still gets the drop on all of them .
men like this may not view her as a threat
because she &apos;s a woman .
who &apos;s likely in the middle of a psychotic break .
we should check psych wards in the area
for recent releases .
and run incident reports on women
who &apos;ve been asked to leave businesses
due to angry outbursts .
how far do we want to go back ? a year ?
no , more than that .
no incident is too small .
she &apos;s probably been boiling for a while .
unless she &apos;s in serious denial , then she &apos;s been
burying her feelings ,
which would have just made her worse and worse .
the question is , why did she choose today ?
hi , this is don . leave a message
and i &apos;ll call you back as soon as possible .
i called you at the station
and , um , they said that you weren &apos;t there .
and you &apos;re not here .
and i still can &apos;t believe you changed your cell .
am i that much of a burden ?
don , i--i need to talk to you , today .
will you--will you meet me at the mall ?
please ?
chief thiers . thanks for coming .
agent rossi .
this is agent hotchner .
good morning .
good morning .
the store was only open a few minutes when this went down .
hell of a way to start the day .
kept the bodies here long past their expiration date .
trying to help us figure out what the hell went on in here .
it would appear 4 shots fired
from generally this position .
4 dead .
proficient .
she comes in with a gun
and she gets all the way to the counter
without attracting attention ?
was this case unlocked when you got here ?
we haven &apos;t touched a thing .
there seems to be a .38 revolver missing .
and 2 .38 rounds on the floor
and all the ammo is still locked up .
she brought bullets from home and came in unarmed ?
access to the ammo but not the weapon .
so , she knew what gun to ask for .
so she comes to the counter , asks for the .38,
he gives her a permit application .
which she doesn &apos;t fill out .
but there &apos;s a 3 @-@ day waiting period .
maybe she &apos;s got a record ,
knows she won &apos;t pass the background .
or there &apos;s something about today and she can &apos;t wait .
so she discreetly loads it , goes to leave ,
they stop her ...
not realizing it &apos;s loaded .
but if it &apos;s just a gun she wants ,
why kill all these guys ?
they were in the way .
this woman had access to ammo for a .38,
but not a gun .
she most likely lives with someone
who &apos;s into guns but doesn &apos;t allow her access .
usually locking weapons is a way to protect children ,
but to keep a key from her is a controlling and dominating act .
she could be in an abusive relationship
and today &apos;s the day she had enough .
she stole the gun at 9 : 00 this morning .
if she needed it to go after somebody ,
why hasn &apos;t she done it yet ?
maybe she was them hostage right now and is working up
the courage to end it all .
or maybe her target knows her personally
and isn &apos;t letting her get close enough for a kill .
and she &apos;s setting a trap and waiting .
mommy !
are you ok ?
what happened ?
did you hurt yourself ?
did you hurt your knee ?
here , i &apos;ll help you .
i &apos;ll help you . come here . there you go .
is this your son ?
what ? yeah , he-- he needs my help .
are you his mother ?
what ?
no , i mean , he &apos;s hurt . can &apos;t you see that ?
son , where &apos;s your mom ?
i &apos;ll take it from here , ma &apos;am . let go .
you gotta help him .
do something . do something .
you gotta do something .
you see right here ? you gotta do something .
you gotta do something .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t take him . please .
please , he needs my help .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m gonna need you to leave .
no--no , but he needs me .
i &apos;m not gonna ask you again .
no , you don &apos;t understand . i mean , he &apos;s--he &apos;s--
all right , ma &apos;am , let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
no .
let &apos;s go !
no ! he needs me .
no , honestly , he needs me !
let &apos;s go , ma &apos;am .
garcia , based on victimology ,
the unsub &apos;s husband or boyfriend
most likely owns a .38 .
we need you to search for white males
age 35 to 50 who have registered that model .
we think he might be law enforcement or military .
it &apos;s possible the unsub was in an abusive relationship
that contributed to her breakdown , garcia .
so look for crossover with reports of domestic abuse .
this is tricky .
do you have anything else to narrow it down ?
why ?
because florida &apos;s a stand @-@ your @-@ ground state .
castle doctrine based on
english common law that allows homeowners
to use deadly force to protect their land .
yeah , it &apos;s a high @-@ falutin way of saying that the gun laws
are lax at best . after the 2008 elections ,
the floridians were nervous
about losing their second amendment rights
and gun sales shot through the roof ,
pun intended .
how many of those men fit that profile in tampa ?
as it stand right now , 638 .
there &apos;s been another shooting .
the media &apos;s gonna run with this .
we need to talk to the press as soon as possible .
and do what ?
just confirm we have an armed woman on the loose
and we can &apos;t find her ?
yes . and to let people know that they need to be vigilant .
paul lyons , security guard .
was he armed ?
no .
you saw video ?
and all we have are the overhead cameras ?
yes , and they &apos;re scattered .
best we got from the video
is a woman with short brown hair .
and she was sitting here .
right .
it looks like she was waiting for
someone that never showed .
and instead , she takes out her rage on the guard ,
in front of the children .
as he escorted her out of the building .
still , that &apos;s pretty controlled
not to turn on anyone else .
that &apos;s true . she could have easily
taken out more people and she didn &apos;t .
he was the person that got in her way .
she &apos;s not ready to confront the source of her rage yet .
yet ?
until she is ,
this will probably happen again .
get down on the ground !
help .
ma &apos;am , please pull forward .
please help me .
all right , ma &apos;am , please don &apos;t move .
will you help him ?
help who ?
you gotta get him . you gotta get my son .
another ambulance is on the way .
no , somebody take him .
i can &apos;t get him .
another ambulance is on the way .
ok . ok . wait .
no , no , no .
no , where are you going ?
damion ?
damion ...
my god , why won &apos;t you help him ?
why won &apos;t you help him ?
ma &apos;am , will you please step out of the vehicle ?
the last time i was on a couch like this
was when my father left .
they all thought i needed to talk ,
but developmentally i wasn &apos;t guided by conscience .
i could only reveal what my mother and teachers
told me was acceptable .
you told them exactly when you knew they wanted to hear .
you don &apos;t have to do that here .
it &apos;s just unfair that she &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s like if we can &apos;t keep each other safe ,
then why are we even doing any of this ?
it &apos;s ... sometimes i think maybe--
maybe gideon was right , you know , maybe ...
maybe it &apos;s just not worth it .
the officer is in critical condition .
anybody get a plate ?
no , just a partial description .
teal green wagon .
garcia ...
this woman opens fire in broad daylight
at a police checkpoint .
she &apos;s desperate . this was an act of survival .
where does this road lead ?
i @-@ 275 .
florida highway patrol has traffic cams
all the way to st.pete. she won &apos;t get far .
two emts just got shot in oakford park .
where &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s the opposite direction .
she went back ?
she &apos;s on a mission .
... address the grace period ...
looking good , buddy .
even higher .
oh , honey , that &apos;s too close .
no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , no , you look beautiful .
just smile .
no .
damion , come here . save me .
get her to smile .
smile , mama . smile .
yeah , smile , mommy .
ok , you smile with me . i &apos;ll smile for you .
dad , he needs to just back up a little bit .
yeah ...
now i &apos;m gonna get you .
her emotional turmoil appears to be manifesting
in the geographic pattern of her spree .
meaning ?
there &apos;s a reason she hasn &apos;t left .
her first was the gun store in west tampa ,
then the security guard in ybor city ,
then the officer at the checkpoint in riverside heights ,
then finally the emts in oakford park .
she &apos;s like a bouncing ball .
there &apos;s no logic . she circled back
after getting through a roadblock .
she &apos;s driven purely by emotion .
she doesn &apos;t care about self @-@ preservation or escape .
it &apos;s like she has nothing to live for .
she may have suffered a loss herself
and she blaming someone for it .
we &apos;re looking for a white female
between the ages of 30 and 40,
driving a teal green station wagon .
but the only thing that matters is her behavior .
which is random .
she &apos;s all over the place .
she could have escaped through that roadblock ,
but she circled back instead .
this tells us she &apos;s got a score to settle .
here . today .
like what ?
when emotional decisions drive an unsub ,
it &apos;s usually connected to an incredible loss ,
the idea that there &apos;s nothing to live for .
we believe that this woman &apos;s
been through the devastating loss of a child .
she woke up this morning ,
loaded up with bullets , and stole a gun .
that is not a typical wednesday .
today means something to her .
she &apos;s been lashing out at the hero , and we believe
that &apos;s because she feels deeply betrayed
by one who let her down .
the fact that her anger seems to be focused
on first responders
instead of hospital personnel or doctors
indicates that her child probably
didn &apos;t die of natural causes .
most likely it was some kind of accident .
and if that &apos;s so , she believes
he should have been saved but wasn &apos;t .
rage like this has been built up over time ,
possibly years .
and it &apos;s debilitating .
she probably hasn &apos;t been a functioning member of society
since the loss of her child .
this rampage
was her final attempt to be heard .
what she started ... ends today .
you mind if i sit here ?
hey , we &apos;ve met before .
mommy and me at the rec , right ?
oh , gosh , it &apos;s-- it must have been a few years ago ,
before the kids hit preschool .
where &apos;s your son ?
i &apos;m sorry , wh @-@ what ?
well , ours were just a few months apart , weren &apos;t they ?
mine &apos;s over there .
he &apos;s gonna be as tall as me soon .
it goes so fast , doesn &apos;t it ?
i swear , it has been the longest and the shortest
6 years of my life .
police say this dangerous suspect
has left a trail of blood behind her .
after wounding an officer at a roadblock ,
she circled back and fired at two paramedics .
luckily she missed , keeping her body count at 5 .
a source inside the tampa p.d.
told us fbi profilers have been brought in ...
we need to try to communicate with this woman directly .
but she &apos;s not talking , she &apos;s shooting .
she feels ignored .
the media is sensationalizing the story .
she &apos;ll continue to respond violently to regain control .
she shot a cop .
the men she &apos;s targeted are my responsibility .
you asked for our help . let us do our job .
inclement weather continues hot and humid
for the remainder of the week .
we have an 80 % chance of a thunderstorm coming in tonight
with possible rainfall .
that could be a major relief for local residents .
we have a special alert coming in from the tampa police .
the fbi is preparing to make a statement right now .
this is aaron hotchner with the fbi .
our team has come from quantico , virginia ,
because we want to talk to you .
we know that you have a personal message
that you need to share with the world .
all we ask is that you stop hurting people ,
because we are listening .
we know you &apos;ve been hurt
and you &apos;ve suffered a terrible loss ,
and we want to talk to you about it .
we want to know how we can help .
we &apos;ve taken the first step .
now it &apos;s up to you .
you can contact me at 1 @-@ 800 @-@ 555 @-@ 0140 .
again , that number is ...
aren &apos;t we gonna get flooded by people calling that number ?
i am hawkeyeing the cell towers
in her comfort zone .
if anyone calls from there , i will know first and fast .
i called you at the station ,
and , um , they said that you weren &apos;t--you weren &apos;t there .
and you &apos;re not here .
and i still can &apos;t believe you changed your cell .
am i that much of a burden ?
don , i--i need to talk to you , today .
will you--will you meet me at the mall ?
please ?
hi , don .
there are benefits to meeting after hours .
you know everyone &apos;s feeling it and nobody wants to talk about it .
it &apos;s too soon , aaron .
you know that better than anyone .
and , uh , doesn &apos;t strauss usually run these assessments ?
there was no way that was gonna happen .
yeah , i didn &apos;t think so .
and i also know that you grieve privately .
but you &apos;ve been through more than any of us
in a very short time .
how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m all right .
i think it &apos;s an ongoing process .
this is not my assessment .
i &apos;m supposed to be asking how you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;ve always had trouble letting people in .
but this is different .
i guess i &apos;ve come to realize ...
i &apos;m more married to this team
than i ever was to 3 ex @-@ wives .
it &apos;s been a hard year .
we &apos;ll get through it .
yeah . we will .
emily and haley .
you &apos;re supposed to stay 100 yards away from me .
please , don &apos;t give me the letter of the law right now .
then don &apos;t give me this .
why are you carrying that around ?
i just need to feel better .
and that concerns me how ?
they don &apos;t remember .
no one remembers .
don , i just need to talk .
ok .
ok .
no leads on the hotline and no sign of her vehicle .
this woman obviously has a plan .
the only clear decision she made this morning
was walking into that gun store .
there are 8 of them in her comfort zone . why choose that one ?
convenience . maybe it &apos;s close to where she lives .
if we &apos;re saying this morning is
when she was the most clear @-@ headed ,
then it was a conscious
decision to walk into that particular store .
i mean , do you have anything of his ?
i mean , not even a painting .
nothing .
you came all the way over here for this ?
you &apos;re just like everybody else .
and you &apos;d rather forget him than admit you couldn &apos;t save him .
i choose to remember the good times .
well , i don &apos;t have that luxury .
i have hundreds of teal wagons .
none of the registrations
match the physical description of our unsub .
what about the gun store ?
mm . and then there &apos;s that .
i searched the entire history of larry &apos;s gun shop .
nothing of significance has ever happened there
aside from this morning &apos;s massacre .
and on top of that ,
you know those 600 @-@ plus registered .38 owners ?
they bought them all over the city ,
so we &apos;re pretty much screwed
unless you can think of some other kind of connection .
then the date only means something to her .
garcia , we profiled that it was a major loss .
run accident reports . look for young victims .
she seems to be going after heroes .
ok , you guys , i &apos;m doing that now ,
but this will take forever .
tampa &apos;s got almost half a million people .
everybody &apos;s got a story . how am i even supposed to--
yeah . oh ?
my superskills just squelched my pessimism .
i have a couple of accidents here
that happened in the last few years
on or around today &apos;s date .
please hold while i deduce .
this looks promising .
ok , there was a high @-@ speed traffic chase in west tampa last year .
a policeman was killed .
who were they chasing ?
uh , hanley waters .
maybe he &apos;s the target .
no . he &apos;s in jail .
he started a whole mess
because he decided to do an armed robbery
at a liquor store and then
have a high @-@ speed car chase with the cops .
oh , there &apos;s video .
it &apos;s 365 days ago to the dot .
i &apos;m sending this to your tablets .
observe and prepare yourself .
who is it who got hit ?
tampa mom shelly chamberlain .
she was unhurt .
her 6 @-@ year @-@ old damion died .
that &apos;s her .
oh--and today is damion &apos;s birthday .
your son enters and leaves your life on the same date .
that &apos;s one hell of a stressor .
it explains why she went on her spree today .
all the good and bad memories are hitting her at once .
and to add salt to it all , the fallen policeman
was the only one who got any attention .
damion was like a footnote .
if shelly chamberlain is our unsub
and the man who caused this is in jail ,
then who &apos;s her target ?
i didn &apos;t come here to fight .
especially not today .
well , that &apos;s the only way we know how to communicate .
will you come celebrate damion &apos;s birthday with me ?
let &apos;s go to his favorite place .
shelly ...
what ? it wouldn &apos;t kill you to go .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
why has it always been so hard for you
to give me what i want ?
i mean , you weren &apos;t there for his birthday .
i tried , shelly . you know i tried .
you refused to stay with me after he died .
that &apos;s not true .
and now here you are again saying no .
just this last time .
i mean ... that &apos;s all i &apos;m asking .
garcia , what &apos;s shelly &apos;s marital status ?
don chamberlain , city firefighter .
he filed for divorce 3 months ago .
a local hero , like some of the others she shot .
but the pain of losing a child destroyed the marriage .
he could be the next target of her rage ,
the man who didn &apos;t bear witness to her grief .
morgan , you find him . dave and i will go to shelly &apos;s house .
clear !
clear !
clear !
clear .
shelly &apos;s car is still here .
and don &apos;s is gone . which means she beat us here
and she moved him in his car .
but why didn &apos;t she just kill him ?
she didn &apos;t travel with any of her other victims .
he must play some part in the fantasy of her rage .
she wants to punish him for something .
the bullets were here .
but don took the gun when he moved out .
dave ?
she broke mirrors all over the house .
she &apos;s disgusted with herself .
she &apos;s built emotional walls--
guilt , worthlessness ,
hopelessness .
then she decided she was tired of waking up this way .
let me show you something else .
his father was a fireman .
his hero .
everything &apos;s perfect .
clearly , she &apos;s enshrined her son .
she couldn &apos;t let go .
there &apos;s not a single reminder of damion anywhere in this house .
because don had accepted it ?
it &apos;s only been a year . what are the chances he &apos;s done grieving ?
maybe that &apos;s why she &apos;s mad at him and wants him to suffer .
hey , guys , look at this .
don edited it together and he put music to it .
this is how he grieved .
yeah , but she wouldn &apos;t know that .
she might force him to grieve the same way she does .
where ? their son &apos;s grave ?
it looks like they celebrated their son &apos;s third , fourth ,
and fifth birthday at sir burger .
her day is coming to an end ,
and today &apos;s an anniversary .
that &apos;s gotta be where she &apos;s going .
look at the camera . come on .
hi , daddy !
welcome to sir burger . you folks know what you want ?
one birthday surprise , please .
outstanding .
and where is the birthday boy or girl ?
he , uh ... couldn &apos;t make it .
oh , sir , then i can &apos;t give you that .
it &apos;s reserved for children , so ...
he always had a birthday surprise .
i want a birthday surprise .
ma &apos;am , it &apos;s our policy .
we , uh , can &apos;t give you that .
for god sakes , shel .
we &apos;re here . isn &apos;t that enough ?
just order something else .
you know , you wouldn &apos;t be here
if it wasn &apos;t for me .
shelly ...
ok , uh , one birthday surprise coming up .
no , it &apos;s too late for that .
what are you doing ?
you don &apos;t care .
that is not true , shel .
there &apos;s not a second in the day
when i don &apos;t think , if i &apos;d only been there ,
if i &apos;d only taken a day off of work for his birthday .
but we have to move on .
shel , at some point we have to move on .
will you stop saying that .
we can &apos;t .
how can we move on without damion ?
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday , dear sam
happy birthday to you
hon , you see this ?
look at you , sweetie .
hey , is it your birthday ?
put it away , shel .
stay away from me .
come on . shelly--
shelly-
now i mean it , don .
let &apos;s get out of here .
you know , you , uh ,
you remind me of my son .
we used to come here .
he liked this place a lot .
please .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
we &apos;re leaving now .
no .
no , we &apos;re gonna stay and we &apos;re gonna celebrate .
how many people we got in there ?
not sure . 5 or 6 .
manager got some out .
i &apos;m calling in swat .
don &apos;t do that . if she feels pressured ,
she might snap .
she hasn &apos;t done that already ?
if i get the shot , i &apos;m taking it .
i &apos;d like to try to talk to her .
it &apos;s too late for that . she &apos;s got hostages .
she &apos;s probably not aware of them .
well , i am . it &apos;s my job to protect them .
you don &apos;t have line of sight
and a sniper round could pass through her
and into somebody else .
blow out the candles , sweetie .
it &apos;s ok .
now cut a piece .
now that &apos;s enough .
leave him alone .
no , he &apos;s gonna have a piece of cake .
hello .
this is aaron hotchner with the fbi . who is this ?
this is bill .
i &apos;m the manager .
bill , is anyone hurt ?
no .
can you see the woman with the gun ?
yes .
can you get the phone to her ?
no , i can &apos;t go back over there .
she &apos;s lost it . i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s gonna do .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
ok . stay where you are . we &apos;ll get you out soon .
he can &apos;t get the phone to her . i &apos;m gonna go in .
you sure about this ?
she hasn &apos;t hurt anyone .
this is about her family and her grief .
if she &apos;s at the end of her break and nothing else matters ,
she could do anything , hotch .
i &apos;ll keep my mike open .
ok , he &apos;s done . we can go now .
he needs to open his presents now .
come on , shelly-
stay away from me .
shel ...
i &apos;m serious .
shelly ?
who are you ?
my name is aaron hotchner .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
and i know it &apos;s damion &apos;s birthday ,
and i just want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened .
what--what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s ok . he &apos;s here to help .
no--nobody helps .
you--you--
you don &apos;t know a thing about damion .
i know he was a happy and confident little boy .
h @-@ how--how could you know that ?
i have a picture of him ,
standing next to you . you &apos;re holding his hand and he &apos;s smiling .
he &apos;s not ... hiding behind you like some children do .
it tells me that you encouraged him
and you gave him a lot of confidence .
that picture , it doesn &apos;t belong to you .
i know . that &apos;s why i want you to have it back .
wait--no--how did you--
you turning 7 today , sam ?
were you in my--
that &apos;s not much older than damion .
i know you don &apos;t want to scare sam , so they &apos;re gonna leave now .
bill , will you show them out , please ?
no ! what-- what are you doing ?
go !
no--what &apos;s---
what &apos;s going on ?
don , i found this picture of you and damion .
it &apos;s clear who his hero was .
i know you blame yourself , and you shouldn &apos;t .
and , shelly , all the hurt that you might inflict on people
is not gonna bring him back .
they need to know what they did .
believe me , everyone who tried to save him that day
isn &apos;t gonna forget .
it &apos;s the day they failed .
they &apos;ll ask themselves what they could have done .
could they have gotten here sooner ?
they &apos;ll heal , but it &apos;s gonna take time .
they &apos;ll move on , but they won &apos;t forget .
i could see that--
that he was dying .
and i tried to help him . i tried .
i tried .
please don &apos;t . please .
i said , honey ,
honey , it &apos;s gonna be all right .
it &apos;s gonna be all right . you hear those sirens ?
do you hear those sirens ?
that is daddy , and daddy is coming ,
and he &apos;s gonna-- he &apos;s gonna help us .
he &apos;s gonna save us .
but you never came .
i know .
i know , shelly , and i &apos;m so sorry .
you know that .
yeah , but he doesn &apos;t know that !
he doesn &apos;t know that .
i--i made a promise
to him . i promised him--
shelly , you have to stop blaming yourself .
shelly , you have to stop blaming yourself .
no .
this little light of mine
i &apos;m gonna let it shine
let it shine , let it shine
cut it out .
you cut it out .
no , honey . honey , i &apos;m driving .
no , i &apos;m not kidding , damion .
you &apos;re being mean , mama .
i &apos;m driving . don &apos;t kick my seat when i &apos;m driving .
i yelled at him .
and it was--
it was ...
the last thing he heard .
that &apos;s your regret .
it &apos;s not what he remembers .
look . look how happy he was .
no , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
losing him is not your fault .
he was taken from you and that &apos;s not fair .
but while he was here ,
while you were lucky enough to have him ,
he was happy .
that &apos;s how he lived and that &apos;s how he left .
60 seconds .
if i had just gotten there 60 seconds earlier ,
emily might still be with us .
derek , you know that you did everything you could .
yeah , yeah , i know . i did everything i could . we all did . i know .
what , that &apos;s supposed to make me feel better ?
you protected each other for years .
don &apos;t expect this to go away anytime soon .
this what ? this what ? this guilt ?
just because you were the last one there
doesn &apos;t mean that you could affect the outcome .
we all wish we had that kind of control .
so what do we do , we just chalk it up to fate ?
what , i can &apos;t blame anybody ? what , this is the will of god ? no .
i do blame somebody . i blame doyle .
hotch , what am i supposed to do ?
she was my friend .
i lost my friend right in front of me .
and i &apos;m supposed to go on like nothing happened ?
you know , we , um ...
we come in here and we talk to you .
where do you go ?
where are you in all of this ?
the same place as you .
