oh , don &apos;t forget you &apos;re picking up mason
from preschool this afternoon .
i was hoping i could get some time to practice .
there &apos;s not a lot of time before the audition .
his moms are blaming him
for everything that happened with callie .
what do you mean ,
&quot; everything that happened with callie &quot; ?
they had sex .
we don &apos;t have time to keep building
and rebuilding this robot
if we want to be ready for competition in three days .
but you do have time to go visit nick ?
he &apos;s locked up .
not that locked up if he has access to a phone
and is texting you constantly .
look , an innocent 17 @-@ year @-@ old kid is gonna
spend the rest of his life in prison
if you don &apos;t tell the truth .
you need to leave me alone .
i have some tax issues with the irs .
we &apos;re selling the house .
why ?
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
well , we obviously can &apos;t show the house like this .
i mean , you &apos;re gonna need to get rid of half the furniture
and all of this ... clutter .
and these are gonna have to go .
people want to picture their lives in the home ,
not yours .
moms !
the robotics competition is tomorrow .
can &apos;t brandon take a break for like 20 minutes ?
i &apos;m trying to think in c + + , but all i can hear is c @-@ minor .
major .
please .
sorry .
and have you considered
having the house professionally cleaned ?
sounds like brandon &apos;s here .
yeah ,
he has his juilliard audition in a couple of days .
hey , i was thinking maybe tomorrow after school ,
i could come over .
i mean , if you &apos;re sure that mike will be at work .
yeah , well ...
mike doesn &apos;t want us hooking up at the apartment .
okay , so where does mike want us hooking up ?
well , mike didn &apos;t say .
i mean , he &apos;d probably never know .
no , no . i mean , if he doesn &apos;t want me there .
i-- i just think it &apos;s because
he kind of sees you like a daughter , in a way .
how about here ?
when is there not someone at my house ?
when they &apos;re at school and work .
and what are these ?
oh , those are case file-- it &apos;s a long story .
okay , well , they &apos;re gonna need to be moved .
so , how soon do we think we can get this place presentable ?
a couple of weeks ?
let &apos;s say a week .
we &apos;re coming up on the holidays ,
nobody &apos;s house @-@ hunting then .
okay , we will do the best we can .
thank you . thank you very much .
hi , aj .
uh , hey .
so , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll see you tomorrow ?
yeah .
all right .
hey .
hey .
so , as i was saying--
how much does the robot weigh ?
117 lbs !
what &apos;s the weight limit ?
120 !
bye .
uh , excuse me .
hello . hi .
sorry .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
bye .
bye .
i didn &apos;t hear you !
120 !
what ?
one--
jesus , can you just go up there , please ?
hey , stop yelling ! we have company !
so , this should go without saying , but we &apos;re gonna need
all of the kids out of the house for the showings .
we want people to experience this
as a quiet and serene home ,
not a college dorm . okay ?
okay .
oh , hello . we &apos;re looking for a callie adams foster .
okay then , talk soon .
brandon , can you please stop for a minute ?
i &apos;m callie &apos;s mom .
what do you need to see her for ?
what &apos;s going on ?
are you callie ?
yes .
do you know a man named patrick molloy ?
sorry to disrupt your evening .
not at all .
thank you for stopping by . be safe , guys .
thank you .
you went by his work several times , callie ?
it was only twice .
he &apos;s accusing you of harassment .
this is serious , callie .
all i did was try to talk to him about kyle .
you told his boss he &apos;s a child molester .
well , he is .
i understand
that you &apos;re upset , okay ?
i am too , but i am already looking into molloy
and why the molestation charges were dropped .
we know why they were dropped .
he made a deal with the detective on kyle &apos;s case .
he changes his story and in return ,
he gets away with abusing some poor kid ,
and kyle goes to prison for the rest of his life
for something he didn &apos;t do . it &apos;s not right .
we don &apos;t know a deal was made , callie .
but regardless , listen , i am the police officer here , okay ?
please let me handle this . do you understand ?
callie .
okay .
can i go ?
yes .
oh , hey , we need to clean out the house ,
so i need you to take those case files
back to wherever you got them , please .
i don &apos;t want her involved in this .
she has enough to focus on with her senior project
and where the hell &apos;s she &apos;s gonna apply to college .
i don &apos;t need her solving cold cases .
i hear you . i do .
and hopefully , with those
police officers stopping by here tonight ,
she is no longer gonna be playing amateur detective .
okay ?
she better not .
you know what ? it would be great if you could focus
a little more on what &apos;s going on at home , too .
we &apos;ve got enough on our plate right now .
welcome to the first robotics
southern california regional competition .
every team must have their robot inspected
before our games begin .
and once you &apos;re cleared to play ,
one of our referees will
run down the rules of today &apos;s tournament .
next up at the weigh station , the bagel bytes .
academics , you &apos;re on deck .
hey , hey , let &apos;s not be intimidated , okay ?
you guys are ready .
remember the first robotics mantra ?
gracious professionalism and &quot; coopertition . &quot;
yeah . oh , great .
who &apos;s that ?
palomar academy .
regional champs the last four years .
they &apos;re all , like , adults .
is that allowed ?
it &apos;s a little controversial .
their &quot; coach &quot; is an aerospace engineer .
all the other mentors
also worked in the field , one way or another ,
but technically , yeah , it &apos;s allowed .
what , so they need two mentors per kid ?
hey , good to see you again , greg .
it &apos;s craig . you know it &apos;s craig .
right . look , we &apos;re in the same alliance this first round ,
which means your team should be sitting pretty
when we start round two .
you &apos;re welcome .
go , team palomar ! systems check in five !
we &apos;re never gonna beat them .
hey , never say never .
and winning isn &apos;t everything .
remember , guys , this is a coopertition .
okay , let &apos;s weigh this thing in .
look who &apos;s here .
hey there .
what are you doing here ?
just came to watch you lose .
oh yeah ? well , you &apos;re gonna be very disappointed .
so , you got a hanging arm ?
yeah , we do .
and it works ?
why would
we have a hanging arm if it didn &apos;t work ?
we also have an autonomous program .
and it &apos;s a great high shooter .
well , we &apos;ll see , i guess .
let &apos;s go .
yeah , losing is not an option .
understood ?
if we don &apos;t make the top six , i &apos;m gonna kill somebody .
120.5 .
you &apos;re half a pound overweight .
you told me it was 117 lbs .
well , yeah , that &apos;s what emma said .
wow . way to throw me under the bus .
i weighed it on my bathroom scale .
your bathroom scale ?
sorry . it &apos;s all i had .
okay , well , what if we take the hanging arm off ?
no !
it doesn &apos;t work .
nobody knows that .
and the potential of it working makes us more of a threat .
guys , we have to do something .
first round starts in 15 minutes .
it &apos;s just half a pound . can &apos;t you just let it slide ?
sorry , anchor beach . you don &apos;t make weight ,
you &apos;re not eligible to compete .
now remember , the house hasn &apos;t been staged yet ,
so you &apos;re gonna need to use your imagination .
but since you &apos;re only in town today ,
i &apos;m gonna give you a sneak peek .
thank you . great bones .
so , why don &apos;t we start upstairs and work our way down ?
all right . two teenage boys live in this room ,
so hold your breath .
is this your first child ?
no , we-- we have a three @-@ year @-@ old boy .
and we &apos;re having a girl .
oh , well , that &apos;s perfect ,
because one of the great features of this house
is the jack and jill bathroom .
that was jack ...
and this is jill .
so , the natural light that this room gets--
oh my god .
oh my god !
sorry .
apparently , jill has company .
yeah , we didn &apos;t know anyone ...
i can see that .
so , let &apos;s just continue on to the master , shall we ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t think the universe wants us having sex .
i can &apos;t believe i let you
put all of these holes in my beautiful robot .
well , it got the weight out , didn &apos;t it ?
tray on .
okay , remember , the first 15 seconds of each round
are for autonomous drive only .
drivers must keep their hands off the controls during this time .
yeah , yeah , yeah , we all know what &quot; autonomous &quot; means .
what the hell happened to your robot ?
we just had a weight issue ,
but we &apos;re good now .
yeah , we cheese @-@ holed it .
i can see that .
when the buzzer sounds , we start the tele @-@ op portion ,
so you can go ahead and grab your controls
and operate manually .
you should &apos;ve taken the hanging arm off .
... clearing defenses , shooting boulders ,
and scaling the tower .
good luck .
hey , rookie mistake , trying to hang a robot .
not if it works . scaling the tower gets you the most points .
yeah , well , that &apos;s fool &apos;s gold , right ?
a strong , consistent robot always wins the day .
i &apos;m surprised greg didn &apos;t tell you that .
well , we let the kids make the decisions .
since this is a high school competition , not boeing .
palomar has won four years in a row .
how many times has anchor beach even placed ?
exactly . help us help you learn something , okay ?
one , forget him . two , you &apos;ve got this .
come on , guys .
so , what is the highest that we &apos;ve ever placed ?
eleventh , back in 2010 .
okay , so maybe douchey does know something .
maybe , but he doesn &apos;t have to be so douchey about it .
hear ye , hear ye ! lords and ladies ,
welcome to the first robotics
southern california regional competition !
today &apos;s tournament will be an epic contest
between worthy champions representing many kingdoms .
whoa . this ... this is ...
amazing .
... battle in a joust of the mind .
and so , without any further folly ,
let the games begin !
alliances ! to your driver stations .
good luck .
go , anchor beach anchor bytes !
oh my god , what is she doing here ?
drivers , behind the line !
and three , two , one . charge !
and the games are on !
red alliance is off to a quick start .
what &apos;s happening ?
nothing .
yes , i can see that .
maybe it &apos;s a problem with our code ?
i quadruple checked it .
anchor beach did not code an autonomous program .
oh no .
they &apos;ll have to make up a lot of ground
in the tele @-@ op portion of the round .
oh no , no , no , no , no !
what the hell is happening ? are you kidding me ?
come on , guys , get that thing moving !
dudes , this is a disaster .
why is there a grown man yelling at my daughter ?
he &apos;s palomar &apos;s coach .
there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
excuse me .
come on , come on !
are you kidding me ?
i am not letting you guys drag us down !
excuse me . excuse me . this is a student competition ,
so how about we just bring it down a couple of notches ?
oh , because i am just doing my job here
and if you don &apos;t have a reason to be back here ,
you should be in the stands with the normal people .
or better yet , how about you pack up
your useless team and go home , okay ?
palomar and hamilton giving it their all
despite the anchor weighing them down .
brandon !
hey , buddy .
how &apos;s it going ?
what &apos;s this ? oh , is that for me ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll put it in my locker , okay ?
sorry . i picked him up from preschool
and he really wanted to see you .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s fine .
we missed you last night .
yeah , i missed you guys too .
i was just practicing so late that ...
oh yeah , no , i get it .
how &apos;s it going ?
all right , i guess .
kinda feels like i &apos;m cramming
for the biggest test i &apos;ve ever had to take .
you &apos;re gonna be great .
so , am i gonna see you tonight ?
uh , yeah , yeah , i think so .
it might be late again , but--
yeah . no pressure .
i-- i know .
um , are we ...
are we okay ?
what do you mean ?
are you still upset about what i told your dad ?
cort , we already talked about this .
i know , but are you sure that &apos;s not the reason
why you didn &apos;t come home last night ?
cortney ...
i have the audition ...
of my life in a few days .
okay ? i don &apos;t have time to rehash this .
i know , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to stress you out .
okay , well , do what you have to .
we &apos;re fine .
okay .
bye , mason .
bye , brandon .
hi . everything okay ?
yeah .
except , um ...
except ?
... my dad knows about us . cort told him .
why ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
no , it &apos;s just ...
explains a lot .
about what ?
it &apos;s fine . i gotta go .
what ?
what did you do ?
the robot was working before you went cheese @-@ holing .
what , you mean before i
made us eligible and saved the day ? again .
you call making complete fools of ourselves saving the day ?
guys ! it &apos;s probably just a loose wire .
great ! there &apos;s like 50 wires !
okay , i don &apos;t need this .
fine ! well , we don &apos;t need you .
yes , we do .
we need both of you .
we &apos;ve got 10 minutes until the next round ,
so let &apos;s start checking wires . now .
i need a second .
we &apos;re resetting the field for the next round .
don &apos;t go too far .
miss thing .
a moment , please .
there &apos;s no time .
honey , is this really how you want to lead ,
with an iron fist ?
the whole point of this
is to work together and solve problems .
okay , this is exactly why i didn &apos;t want my mom to come .
i &apos;m not here as your mom . i &apos;m here as your vice principal .
well , you &apos;re talking to me like my mom ,
which is stressing me out
even more than i &apos;m already stressed out ,
because we just wasted our first round ,
and i &apos;ve got minutes to make up for
that pathetic performance that we just did .
so either leave or leave me alone .
excuse me . hi , do you have a moment ?
we &apos;re-- we &apos;re looking into the murder of martha johnson .
didn &apos;t they already catch the kid who did it ?
and aren &apos;t you a little young to be cops ?
sorry . i work for an organization
called the juvenile justice center .
yeah , we believe that the kid who was convicted ...
well , he didn &apos;t do it ,
and the real killer &apos;s still out there .
well , i didn &apos;t know martha all that well .
my husband and i had just moved here when it happened .
it was all so awful .
is there any chance you remember
anyone unusual hanging around at the time ?
someone who seemed sketchy , like they didn &apos;t belong here ?
no , not that i can think of ,
but it was a long time ago , so ...
in the detectives &apos; notes ,
they wrote down something about a curb painter
knocking on doors . does that ring a bell ?
it doesn &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
okay . thank you .
so , let &apos;s say we find this curb painter
or some other weird dude who was in the neighborhood .
what &apos;s the plan ? just walk up to them and ask ,
&quot; hey , by any chance ,
did you kill an old lady four years ago ? &quot;
no , but maybe we can prove that
the police never followed up on any leads
that could &apos;ve led to another suspect .
you know ? or we could find someone who had
a record and maybe a motive .
couldn &apos;t that create reasonable doubt ?
it could .
and would that be enough to get the jjc to take his case ?
it would help .
you can take it .
no , it &apos;s fine .
trouble in paradise ?
oh , there &apos;s always trouble when i &apos;m involved .
okay , we &apos;d better have fixed this .
i will not be humiliated again .
hey , you &apos;re not the only one on the team , you know .
&apos;cause round two begins in three minutes .
look at her giving us the stink eye .
i bet they hate not being
the only all @-@ girl team behind the glass .
yeah , well , they go to an all @-@ girl school ,
so it &apos;s not like they had to earn it .
oh no , she &apos;s coming over here .
let the bitch @-@ fest begin .
hey . i just wanted to wish you luck
and say it &apos;s so great to see another all @-@ girl drive team .
thanks .
yeah , good luck , too .
bye .
she seems nice .
lovely .
don &apos;t be fooled .
i &apos;ve just never seen her act like this .
yeah , well , like you said ,
she &apos;s got a lot to prove , you know ?
no , it &apos;s more than that .
she jumped into this right after the whole nick thing .
maybe this is too much for her to handle .
well , after today , she won &apos;t have to worry about robotics ,
and that &apos;ll be a lot of stress taken off of her , you know ?
that &apos;s true .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re there .
she &apos;s not . it &apos;s a good thing we all didn &apos;t come .
yeah , well , do me a favor
and keep me updated on what &apos;s going on .
i will . where are you ?
i just-- i &apos;m running some errands .
okay , well , the next round &apos;s about to start . i &apos;ve gotta go .
i &apos;ll call you later . i love you .
okay , i love you too .
hey , stef , it &apos;s hank from vice .
so , it looks like the charges against molloy were dropped
because the victim turned out to be 18 .
if you wanna check him out , it &apos;s benjamin torres ,
636 everwood , apartment three .
hi , is benjamin here ?
can i help you ?
yeah , are you benjamin ?
who are you ?
my name is stef adams foster .
i &apos;m a police officer .
i wanted to know if you &apos;d be willing to talk to me
about a man named patrick molloy .
what &apos;s this about ?
you filed a complaint about him four years ago ,
and i was just wondering why-- why you withdrew it .
if you &apos;re police , you know why .
how old are you , benjamin ?
18 .
18 . so you were-- you were 14 back then , right ?
look , patrick molloy , he &apos;s a bad guy
and he preys on kids .
i &apos;m trying to put him away , okay , but i &apos;m gonna need your help .
i-- i can &apos;t help you .
why not ?
did someone try to ... get you to change your mind ,
get you to change your story , or-- like a cop or a detective ?
i know you &apos;re scared , you know ? i get it .
but i really don &apos;t think that you want this guy
doing to other kids what he did to you .
hey , and you can trust me . i promise , you really can .
it was a detective . he said ...
he &apos;d have my parents deported .
okay .
do you remember his name ?
was it-- was it detective gray ?
okay .
it &apos;s not an &quot; 8 . &quot; it &apos;s a &quot; b. &quot;
and i didn &apos;t want my curb painted in the first place ,
but what these guys do is , they leave a flier in your door ,
&quot; check this box if you don &apos;t want your curb painted tomorrow . &quot;
it &apos;s a total scam .
so , naturally , i forget to check the box ,
and he paints , and the next thing i know ,
i &apos;ve got a guy on my doorstep demanding money from me .
real jackass , too . he was very aggressive about it .
and this was right around the time
that martha johnson was murdered ?
same week , as far as i can remember .
i told the cops about it ,
but they said that they already got the guy who killed her ,
so i didn &apos;t think much of it .
do you remember anything else about him ?
was there a company name on that flier ?
no , but i can tell you where he lives .
lords and ladies , let first stronghold ,
round two commence ! the drivers behind the line !
and three , two , one . charge !
please move , please move , please move .
oh , thank god .
yes !
round two , and there &apos;s anchor beach roaring back to life .
looks like they had an autonomous program after all .
brant country day wasting no time in clearing that wall obstacle .
time for tele @-@ op . anchor beach is making up for lost time .
oh , they &apos;ve got culver city pinned under their tower .
basket , anchor beach !
round four .
that first @-@ round malfunction is a distant memory
for anchor beach , who &apos;s on a roll .
ouch ! code orange has foshay pinned !
remember , if you hit a bot for more than five seconds ,
it &apos;ll mean a point &apos;s deduction at the end of the round .
brant country day handles the drawbridge with ease .
they &apos;ve really come on strong this competition .
round eight , another obstacle cleared for anchor beach .
it may not look pretty ,
but that robot can move .
milken &apos;s putting on a show at the opposite end of the field .
shoot .
anchor beach scores again !
one more round like this ,
and they &apos;re a lock for the top six
and a spot in the finals !
round nine , commence !
three , two , one . charge !
this is it , folks .
our last round of regular competition .
da vinci academy makes quick work of that obstacle .
and down by the tower ,
anchor beach puts itself in position to shoot .
what are they doing ?
hey , what the hell ?
and they &apos;re pinned by the brant country day bot .
hey , come on , they &apos;re holding us
for way more than the five seconds .
hey , ref , come on ! that &apos;s at least a yellow card !
i knew it . i knew it .
i knew that they were cheaters .
those girls won &apos;t let anchor beach go .
hey , ref !
what , are you blind ? open your eyes !
that &apos;s not gracious professionalism , mariana .
you &apos;re gonna get us disqualified .
this could spell disaster for the anchor beach comeback kids .
dilapidated house with a jungle out front .
this has got to be it .
so , we &apos;re just gonna ask him
if he painted mrs. johnson &apos;s curb four years ago .
yeah , and see how he reacts .
well , what if he reacts ... poorly ?
well , there &apos;s two of us and hopefully only one of him .
well , looks like he &apos;s not home , so let &apos;s go .
doug harvey .
where are you going ?
just taking a look .
win or lose , guys , hell of a showing .
yeah , not counting that last round .
how did the refs not call that ?
i swear , if we don &apos;t make it into the finals ,
i &apos;m going to smash someone in the face .
lords and ladies , may i have your attention please ?
the tournament results are in ,
and here are the current standings
going into the championship round .
in first place ...
palomar academy , the programmers .
in second place ...
no surprise there .
... brant country day , baby got bots .
third place , hamilton high school , the da vinci coders .
and fourth , high tech la ,
team 4 element .
in fifth place , linda vista high school , the lab brats .
and rounding out the top six ...
andrew &apos;s prep , code orange !
and now for the rest of the results .
seventh place goes to the foshay learning center , the wolverines .
eighth place , anchor beach community charter , anchor bytes .
hey , eighth place .
that &apos;s the best finish in school history .
tenth place , culver city , bagel bytes .
hey , not bad . seriously .
for a girl .
oh , no . what is she doing ? maybe you should--
maybe you should .
i think we all should .
you need to pick us as your alliance .
this is the finals , and you didn &apos;t even make it into the top six .
because you pinned us for longer than five seconds
and got away with it .
sorry .
you don &apos;t have to pick a team that &apos;s in the top six .
it &apos;s tradition , but it &apos;s not a rule .
and we &apos;ve got a hanging arm ,
which you need to beat palomar alliance .
mariana .
okay , deal .
great .
there &apos;s just one problem .
our arm doesn &apos;t work .
wait . are you kidding me ?
but here &apos;s the thing , palomar doesn &apos;t think it works .
because it doesn &apos;t .
exactly . it doesn &apos;t work .
but we &apos;ve got a whole hour to change that and blindside them .
one hour .
what if we can &apos;t fix it in time ?
if we put all of our heads together ,
and we &quot; cooperitate , &quot;
maybe we can .
it &apos;s the only way you &apos;re gonna win , and you know it .
let &apos;s show everyone what a group of girls ...
hey .
... and a couple of boys can do .
what do you say ?
you never remember to eat when you &apos;re practicing .
thanks .
you sure you don &apos;t want us
to drive you to the airport tomorrow morning ?
&apos;cause we can if you ...
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m sure .
i think that &apos;ll just make me more nervous .
so , how are you feeling ? are you ready ?
if i tell you the truth ,
will you promise not to say , &quot; i told you so &quot; ?
uh , i shall do my best . how &apos;s that ?
okay , well , i think that i &apos;m ...
not as ready as i should be . i think i &apos;ve ...
well , i &apos;ve been kind of distracted , i guess .
okay . and i think that
i might have contributed to that .
little bit .
i never meant to throw you out the door , b. i didn &apos;t .
and i know that you are not solely to blame
for what happened with callie .
okay ? i am sorry that i said that .
i &apos;m really sorry , too , mom .
i miss you . i do , b.
i just , i would love if you came home .
i can &apos;t leave ...
cort and mason .
okay , what happens if you do get into juilliard ?
well ... then it &apos;s different , though .
then i have to go .
please promise me , b ...
that you will not hold back on this audition
because you feel that you have an obligation to this girl .
i want to go to juilliard more than anything .
so , i promise .
okay .
well , you are welcome to stay again tonight .
practice as long as you want , hon .
thanks .
yup .
eat your sandwich .
so besides the fact that we &apos;re staking out a potential murderer
should i be worried that you &apos;re a magnet for trouble ?
probably .
so ... been to juvie twice ?
yeah .
what &apos;d you do ?
i smashed up a car with a baseball bat ,
and the other time was for running away .
that scare you ?
no . i &apos;m sure you had your reasons .
i guess , but i definitely ...
made some bad choices .
yeah , but ... that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a bad person .
how would you know ?
i know .
what do you think ?
i think we should leave the detectiving to the real detectives .
so , we spread the word .
okay , are we sure that this is the right strategy ?
i mean , telling everybody our arm works ?
it &apos;s done . we just have to hope that they fall for it .
all right , group huddle .
what &apos;s our motto ?
bitches get things done ! whoo !
go , bot bitches ! woo @-@ hoo !
who &apos;s that ?
um , that &apos;s just our vice principal .
let the championship round begin
with drivers behind the line .
good luck .
let &apos;s do this .
here we go . here we go .
three , two , one . charge !
anchor beach moves down the field .
bot coming up on your left .
thanks .
i &apos;m about to score .
brant country day shoots and scores !
nice .
grab that boulder .
guys we gotta make every shot here count , okay ?
block brant . they are killing us .
30 seconds . no one &apos;s covering us .
they &apos;re all over brant and high tech la .
i guess they didn &apos;t believe that we fixed the arm .
it &apos;s hang time .
shouldn &apos;t we stop anchor bytes from taking the tower ?
their arm doesn &apos;t work . they haven &apos;t used it all day .
no , they fixed it . look , they &apos;re heading toward the tower .
hey , cover the anchor bytes .
don &apos;t let them come back to the tower .
palomar &apos;s coming .
damn it , they believed us .
what do we do ?
hey , what are they doing ?
they &apos;re retreating .
duh ! why are they retreating ?
20 seconds .
where did you hear that they fixed their arm ?
umm ... from them .
if they fixed their arm , are they gonna tell everyone ?
ignore that . ignore that . don &apos;t cover anchor beach .
you focus on brant . hey , focus on high tech la .
it &apos;s working , go ! 15 seconds !
i &apos;m going as fast as i can .
they &apos;re coming back for ...
shush , shush , shush .
pin brant !
but if we don &apos;t do anything ...
no ! listen to me ! stay the course , guys . don &apos;t fall for that .
linda vista heads off to defend brant
as the red alliance starts to take an insurmountable lead !
so , the arm works ?
uh ... we &apos;ll see .
fingers crossed .
toes and eyes .
but wait , anchor beach is heading back to the tower ?
no , no , no . bring it back .
bring it back to this tower !
stop anchor beach !
all we have to do is attach .
palomar is heading back to try to stop anchor beach .
now lift ...
but it &apos;s too late ! their arm is attached !
five seconds .
now it &apos;s just a matter
of pulling up to score the 15 @-@ point bonus .
can they do it in time ?
three ...
two ...
the blue alliance wins ! for the first time in four years ,
we have a new champion , southern california .
brant country day , anchor beach , and high tech la
came from defeat with a dramatic last @-@ second win !
i can &apos;t believe we did it .
so , the strategy that we use was to tell everybody
that the arm worked .
uh , because it did ?
duh ! we didn &apos;t lie .
gracious professionalism , you know ?
anyway , we knew that no one would believe us ,
because girl team , right ?
and it worked . well , at first it didn &apos;t , but then it did .
oh my god , you should &apos;ve seen the look
on those palomar engineers &apos; faces
when our robot lifted itself .
whatever . it would &apos;ve made sense if you &apos;d actually bothered to come .
you told us not to come .
you should &apos;ve known better .
anyway , you can see us at worlds .
that is if we can raise the $ 5,000 entrance fee
in less than three weeks .
sweetheart , maybe you should pass on worlds .
what ? why would i do that ?
because you &apos;ve got a lot going on , you know ,
and your grades junior year are very key at getting into college .
worlds would look great on a college application .
honey , you haven &apos;t even studied for your sats yet .
i know . i got this . i can do it all .
well , maybe you should let some of us help .
i mean , seems like that &apos;s your problem .
you try to do everything .
that &apos;s not true .
i delegate .
hey , i saw that .
who was that ?
it was our realtor .
we have an offer on the house .
already ? they haven &apos;t even put a sign up .
well , apparently , she showed it this morning
and the couple who saw it want to make an offer .
all cash , 10 % above the asking price .
that &apos;s good . it &apos;s , uh ... we could use the extra money .
yeah , the other news is ...
they want a 10 @-@ day escrow ...
and we &apos;ll have to be out by the end of the month .
sorry . i just wanted to wish you luck .
oh . that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m done anyway .
i gotta get home and pack .
so , cortney &apos;s is home ?
oh , well , i mean , i don &apos;t know .
but ... this won &apos;t be home anymore , so ...
hey , what did you mean today ,
by the way , when you said , &quot; this explains a lot &quot; ?
oh , umm , it &apos;s your dad .
i don &apos;t think he wants me dating aj .
because of us ?
no , because of me .
well-- no , don &apos;t let him ...
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m just tired .
of what ?
people making me feel wrong .
good .
anyway , good luck tomorrow .
i &apos;m really happy for you . this is your dream .
i &apos;m scared .
