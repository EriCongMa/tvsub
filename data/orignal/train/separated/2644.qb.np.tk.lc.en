karakurt .
we know you &apos;re working for the cabal .
how was the virus delivered ?
you &apos;ve been set up .
you infected the senator , and now they will come for you .
suspect &apos;s name is special agent elizabeth keen .
but as of today , she &apos;s a fugitive .
dembe &apos;s missing .
where is raymond reddington ?
so be it .
we &apos;re gonna die in here .
what would you do to help elizabeth keen ?
anything .
i &apos;m happy to report your funds have cleared , gerald .
you &apos;ll have full use of the penthouse suite until 9 : 00 a.m.
that &apos;s when the clean @-@ up crew arrives .
thank you . i can &apos;t tell you --
oh , you don &apos;t have to say anything .
i &apos;m terribly sorry for your loss .
this man &apos;s drugs ate my son alive .
and now you &apos;ll deliver payment in kind .
shall we wake him ?
the hour of vengeance has arrived .
the road to healing begins tonight .
what happens next is up to you .
oh , and if you find that you can &apos;t finish your meal ,
we &apos;ve provided takeout bags in the kitchen .

you know him ?
no .
neither did i.
had to dig out my agency rolodex to find someone who recognized him .
name &apos;s matias solomon -- a real lone wolf .
he was cia ?
asset only .
in ethiopia until he joined the eritrean war .
solomon committed atrocities on the battlefield so vulgar
even the cia disavowed him .
i need you to find him , leonard .
i appreciate you wanting to help your associate ,
but solomon &apos;s been m.i.a. for a decade .
dembe is more than an associate to me .
please find him .
excuse me .
who are ...
aram .
surprise .
what are you doing in my apartment ?
and , uh , who was that guy ?
i &apos;m sorry for the intrusion .
i &apos;m here because i need your help .
where &apos;s agent keen ?
something &apos;s happened to her , hasn &apos;t it ?
yes , thank god .
i got a shower for the first time in days .
i &apos;m so happy to see you .
not many people are these days .
okay , i probably shouldn &apos;t say this ,
but you look fantastic .
aram .
we &apos;re looking for a woman who calls herself the djinn .
a matchmaker of sorts ,
who pairs clients with what they most desire --
greed , lust , revenge .
they say she can make any fantasy come true .
we have a web address .
there are encryptions we can &apos;t decipher .
i know this is asking a lot ,
but we wouldn &apos;t come to you
if reddington didn &apos;t believe that this djinn might be helpful
in clearing my name .
if i agree to help ...
i &apos;ll have to let agent ressler know .
we &apos;re in a symbiotic relationship .
by helping us , agent ressler keeps us close .
i have to believe ressler wants the truth
about who attacked our country just as much as we do .
if that &apos;s true , he &apos;ll accept help anywhere he can get it .
he wouldn &apos;t take it from tom .
what ? tom ? i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
he knows you &apos;re in trouble .
he came and offered to help ,
and agent ressler turned him down .
the djinn -- we need to find the djinn .
if you want to help keen , this is how you do it .
find karakurt .
the cabal hired him to do what she &apos;s being framed for --
the orea bombing , the senator &apos;s murder .
yeah , i know karakurt . he &apos;s russian garbage .
probably hitting some strip club in st. petersburg right now .
karakurt betrayed his country .
if he went back to russia ,
the fsb would shoot him on sight .
my intel says he &apos;s had extensive plastic surgery .
he &apos;s trying to change his identity .
says here you had him in custody and you let him go .
it also says karakurt &apos;s sister
is married to charlie volkens --
violent , unstable .
he runs a crime ring in the rust belt .
word is that &apos;s where karakurt &apos;s laying low .
why come to me ? hmm ?
your boy ressler told me to hit the highway .
donald ressler &apos;s a fine agent .
within the rules , he &apos;ll do everything possible
to find elizabeth and the truth .
you don &apos;t think that &apos;ll be enough ?
maybe .
given what we &apos;re up against , i &apos;m willing --
throw out the rulebook .
bend the bindings a little .
all right , so what &apos;s the fbi doing about this ?
i assume their entire focus is on reddington and keen .
you &quot; assume . &quot;
don &apos;t you know ?
i &apos;m on leave from the task force
while they investigate my part
in the shooting of tom connolly .
so this isn &apos;t a sanctioned op .
no . i &apos;m asking you to figure out a way to infiltrate the crime ring
that may be protecting karakurt .
if you &apos;re caught , something happens ,
you &apos;re on your own .
i had no knowledge of this .
i walked in , and they were just there .
we have a confirmed sighting .
i live at the nottingham apartments .
tell mpd to shut down a five @-@ block radius around adams morgan .
reset the checkpoints . notify all agencies .
run it into the ground .
i know you think she &apos;s innocent ,
but you did the right thing coming forward .
uh , mr. reddington asked me to .
why would he do that ?
because he needs our help finding the djinn .
who &apos;s the djinn ?
the kidnap and rape of a british princess .
公主在被绑架 强奸后 被丢弃在急症室外
the mauling death of a big @-@ game poacher locked in a lion &apos;s cage .
丛林之王成功复仇
the vivisection of a drug dealer while he was eaten alive .
according to mr. reddington ,
these are not random acts of perverse cruelty .
each was a revenge fantasy ,
planned and providing by a woman known only as the djinn .
the djinn ?
you mean , like a genie ?
all i know is , they believe she can help clear agent keen &apos;s name .
the djinn apparently grants your deepest , darkest wish .
if you can imagine it and pay for it ...
she &apos;ll make it happen .
how do you contact this ... djinn ?
right . in the early days of the web ,
a virtual fantasy world was created online
to connect people of all ages from around the world .
the technology was qukly obsolete ,
but the site was never taken down .
状态 中立 位置 市政厅 准备中
today , it is a hidden oasis for freaks and weirdos .
状态 中立 位置 市政厅 准备中
no digital signatures . tor @-@ encrypted on the dark web .
it offers anonymity for new clients to contact the djinn .
once you locate her avatar ,
状态 中立 位置 市政厅 准备中
the djinn invites you to a private room ,
状态 中立的 位置 市政厅 准备中
where you give her your name and bank account .
that &apos;s it .
you sign off .
the djinn verifies your financial resources .
if she likes what she sees ,
she contacts you directly to set a meeting .
i don &apos;t buy it .
i mean , if they &apos;re trying to prove keen &apos;s innocence ,
why go after some high @-@ priced vigilante ?
and if that &apos;s not what they &apos;re trying to prove ,
why risk everything asking for aram &apos;s help ?
why do any of what they &apos;ve done ?
a troll farmer , a counterfeiter ,
a company that launders money for the cabal ,
now this djinn -- it doesn &apos;t make sense .
they &apos;re fugitives , but they &apos;re not running .
they &apos;re searching .
but if not for keen &apos;s innocence , then what for ?
well , we know they &apos;re trying to set up a meeting ,
but we have to find a where and when .
if we can find the djinn first , maybe we can intercept them .
cross @-@ reference all our known cases .
look for the i.p. addresses ,
how her clients communicated with her ,
anything that can provide a clue to her identity .
you did it .
no . you did .
your hour of vengeance has arrived .
the road to healing begins now .
what happens next is up to you .
allah teaches us forgiveness ,
but some things -- they &apos;re unforgivable .
do you have to torture me , too ?
i &apos;m preparing for my next interrogation .
with a spoon ?
i counted four men .
you might get two before they kill you .
so be it .
when solomon figures out he can &apos;t break me ,
he &apos;ll go after my daughter , her little girl .
whatever it takes to find raymond .
if i &apos;m dead , they &apos;re safe .
i found a link .
the revenge fantasies arranged by the djinn
occurred around the world ,
but two of them drove down the earnings of one company .
how ?
well , it seems cannibalism isn &apos;t good for business .
the victim &apos;s body was found in a dumpster outside the hotel
wrapped in hotel towels .
now no one wants to sleep there .
just like no one wants to fly a certain airline in south america .
it went bankrupt after a hijacking planned by the djinn .
azeri financial is a majority shareholder
in both the airline and the hotel .
it &apos;s a private holding company in new york .
two is hardly a pattern . maybe it &apos;s just a coincidence .
it could be , but it &apos;s not . aram ?
that is bahram bakhash ,
owner and c.e.o. of azeri financial .
the abduction took place two hours ago .
so far , there have been no ransom demands .
well , if someone hired this djinn to bankrupt azeri financial ,
we need a motive .
and more importantly --
what does any of this have to do with keen ?
&quot; i am not courageous .
only the poor have courage .
why ? because they are hopeless .
to get up every morning to plow a potato field in wartime ,
to bring kids with no prospects into the world .
to live poor -- that takes courage . &quot;
ugh . i forget the next line .
you &apos;re a terrible actor .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with my performance .
it &apos;s the play .
bertolt brecht uses the alienation effect
to create emotional distance from the audience .
i don &apos;t know .
so , why did you produce his play ?
i was completely swept up
in the idealism of the theatre owner --
a pipe @-@ smoking cream puff of a german named gerta .
she read &quot; mother courage &quot; to me aloud --
the whole play in one sitting .
a brilliant exploration of the politics of war
and those who profit from it .
sadly , it was 1991,
and audiences were going in droves to see &quot; cats . &quot;
gerta lost every penny of my investment ,
but she remains grateful to this day .
her theater is ours as long as we need it .
the djinn . we have a meeting point --
a bench in astoria park tomorrow at 9 : 00 a.m.
when she arrives , keep her in the open until i move in .
this woman -- the djinn --
you said she can help , but you haven &apos;t said how .
i have reason to believe that
at least two of the people she &apos;s catered to
are powerful members of the cabal .
and if we get to her , we can get to them .
in case we lose visual contact ,
you &apos;ll be wearing a tracking device .
if you &apos;re thinking of reaching out to him , don &apos;t .
now that he &apos;s on the fbi &apos;s radar ,
they &apos;re likely monitoring any communications .
this is important , lizzy .
promise me you won &apos;t call him .
i promise .
we should get some rest .
she hasn &apos;t called yet . more tea ?
sure .
karakurt had extensive facial surgery .
do you know anyone who would want to hurt your father ?
no .
no one . he &apos;s a devout man .
respected , with many friends .
when did you see him last ?
here . this morning .
he called a board meeting to discuss a hostile takeover .
how hostile ?
the newcastle venture group is an investment firm .
they made an aggressive buyout proposal .
which your father opposed ?
yes . he wants the company to stay in the family .
in his absence , would the board approve of the buyout ?
buyout proposals happen all the time .
no one gets kidnapped because of them .
look , my father raised my sister , nasim , and me
after our mother was killed by a bomb during the iran @-@ iraq war .
he &apos;s everything to us .
please .
find our father , bring him back to us .
nice to make your acquaintance , elizabeth .
if you &apos;ll be so kind as to follow my instructions ,
we &apos;ll be having a lovely visit in no time .
first , i &apos;ll need you to leave your cellphone .
opposite you , there &apos;s a gap in the fence .
follow the path until you find some portable restrooms .
walk there now , and enter the one on the right .
freeze ! you ! don &apos;t move !
get there now .
you did well , elizabeth .
for my privacy and your safety , i &apos;m turning off the lights .
wait . w @-@ where are we going ?
enjoy the ride .
i &apos;ll have a cup of hot tea waiting .
i &apos;ve called everyone .
it &apos;s as if he just vanished .
there &apos;s been no demand for a ransom or anything --
just silence .
what can i do , hamid ? i feel so helpless .
i put out a reward for any information ,
and the fbi assures me they &apos;re doing everything they can .
they want to talk to you . i &apos;ll text you their number .
yes , of course . anything i can do to help .
i &apos;ll finish up what i &apos;m doing here and then call them .
man az samime ghalbam .
that was hamid .
he &apos;s worried about you , father .
he should be .
i know this may seem barbaric to you ,
but no more so than what you did to me .
elizabeth .
thank you for enduring my security measures .
please , take off your shoes .
get comfortable .
it &apos;s not often i &apos;m contacted by an international fugitive .
we do our homework .
why don &apos;t you tell me your fantasy ,
and let &apos;s see if we can help ?
&quot; if &quot; ?
not all wishes are granted .
we help at our discretion .
i want revenge .
you have my full attention .
i was framed .
i want the people who did this to admit it
and pay for what they &apos;ve done .
i don &apos;t believe that .
it &apos;s what i want .
i &apos;m sure it is .
you wouldn &apos;t be human if it wasn &apos;t .
but i &apos;m not interested in what you want .
i &apos;m interested in what you deeply desire .
i can sense that death and vengeance
aren &apos;t what drive you , elizabeth .
or feed your soul .
what does ?
a lost world , i suspect . another life .
why don &apos;t you tell me about that fantasy ,
and maybe i can help you ?
if you can &apos;t face your truths , i can &apos;t be of service .
my car will return you to astoria park .
i &apos;m sorry .
hamid &apos;s right .
i can &apos;t think of anyone who would want to harm my father .
he &apos;s a good man .
your father &apos;s company --
i have nothing to do with the company .
the newcastle venture group --
we understand they &apos;re mounting a hostile takeover .
did your father ever mention them to you ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
we know that it &apos;s a front ,
but we don &apos;t know who &apos;s behind it yet .
your father never mentioned them ?
my father never talks business with me .
surely you must know how that is , samar navabi .
i know how that is .
but i took control of my life a long time ago .
then you &apos;re braver than i.
长岛市 纽约州
nasim ?
nasim ?
forgive me for intruding .
nasim ?
hamid .
there you are .
have you heard anything about father ?
no .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
the fbi are doing everything they can .
i know nothing else matters right now ,
but i need your advice .
you &apos;re the only one who values it .
the board members -- they &apos;re nervous .
they were nervous even before father was abducted .
quarterly earnings , share value , and now with him gone ,
i &apos;ve tried to convince them to wait ,
that to decide the fate of the company
at a time like this is insane .
they won &apos;t listen .
i want him to be proud of me .
father groomed you to be his successor
because he trusts you .
he has confidence in you . the board will listen to you .
it &apos;s a fair offer . take it .
it should have been you .
running the company .
the bias , the prejudice .
he should have seen past it .
i just pray they find him .
your turn , chief .
not so fast .
lift your pant leg up . the right one .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s in the sock .
i had to give them something . they made me .
okay , that &apos;s enough !
raise your hands ! face to the wall !
you didn &apos;t have to hit me that hard .
that wasn &apos;t part of the plan .
get his weapon .
wait .
hello ?
hi . i &apos;m sorry . is ...
it &apos;s you . calling for the guy .
y @-@ yeah .
i can &apos;t believe it .
he was hoping you &apos;d call .
he wanted me to give you this number .
lizzy ?
what is it ?
555 @-@ 0123 .
when he comes back , do you want me to ...
what happened with the djinn ?
we tracked you to the warehouse ,
but then you were gone and the tracking signal left the city .
she had guards , so i couldn &apos;t ask her about the cabal .
i gave her the story , but she didn &apos;t believe i was being honest .
she wanted to know my real fantasy .
so .
well , i didn &apos;t say anything .
i put the bug on her shoe .
what is your fantasy ?
it &apos;s been the same thing for as long as i can remember .
i &apos;m walking in a park with my husband .
in between us is our little girl .
i &apos;m holding her hand in mine ...
and i never let go .
thanks to your shoe switcheroo ,
apparently we have an address for the djinn .
hi , there . is your mommy home ?
you &apos;re not the djinn .
what are you doing ?
looking at the classifieds .
&quot; tuba mouthpiece for sale &quot; ?
the number will lead us to reddington .
thanks . all i wanted to hear .
oh , my god !
you followed me .
what &apos;s the djinn &apos;s name ?
is that why you came to me ?
so that i &apos;d give up the djinn ?
i won &apos;t do that .
let &apos;s forget about the djinn for a moment .
i &apos;d be more intrigued to hear about you , alice .
i &apos;m sure you have a story to tell .
i love stories .
i used to work the convention circuit ,
standing next to supercars all day in heels and short shorts .
as a brand ambassador ,
you &apos;re trained to answer questions and push product .
the ddjinn found me through an agency i work with .
most of our clients are men . they enjoy a little eye candy .
when i started ,
the djinn scripted every word i said ,
but i guess i had a knack for reading people ,
knowing their desires .
in time , i became the face of the operation .
i imagine selling fantasies is a very profitable business ,
one you are clearly not profiting from .
you have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
the range rover in the driveway ,
those diamond earrings , your shoes --
your aspirations clearly exceed your reality .
i &apos;ve been preparing to quit .
i have more than enough money .
lies on top of pretense , my dear .
you haven &apos;t quit because you enjoy the power .
there &apos;s no shame in that .
do i look ashamed ?
no , you do not .
it appears we &apos;re all good at reading people . what fun .
but , alice , i don &apos;t think you see
that we have an opportunity here
to make both of our fantasies come true .
the djinn is a middleman i believe you &apos;ve outgrown .
tell me his name .
tell me all about him , and i &apos;ll get him out of your way .
you can launch your own operation .
maybe one that &apos;s a little more optimistic and constructive
than the present business model .
i even have your first client all lined up .
so , this djinn -- tell me .
that &apos;s your chest collapsing . that feeling ?
asphyxiation will be next .
your suffering is almost over .
i wish the same could be said for mine .
i did what i had to ...
to keep you alive .
you did what you did because you couldn &apos;t stand to look at me .
well , i am making you look at me now .
look at me , father !
your company is gone .
hamid and the board sold it to the newcastle venture group .
that &apos;s not possible .
you know , for years ,
i had dreamt of ways to get my revenge on you .
so many fantasies swimming in my head .
so many that they gave birth to a business .
as the djinn , i make people &apos;s fantasies come true .
you have no idea how much people will pay
to experience their darkest desires .
and i &apos;ve been collecting that money
so that one day i could live out my own fantasy .
and guess what day it is , father .
you said i was unfit to run a company .
now i own one -- yours .
newcastle venture group is mine .
i figured it out .
i had to go through six pass @-@ throughs
and two loan @-@ outs in the caymans , but --
aram .
you look nice today .
aram . what did you figure out ?
right . the newcastle venture group --
nasim bakhash controls it .
bahram &apos;s daughter .
and the board of azeri financial just approved the buyout offer .
and that only happened because bahram wasn &apos;t there to oppose it .
that &apos;s what this is -- her revenge fantasy .
she &apos;s getting back at her father for cutting her out .
that &apos;s why she kidnapped him .
and the only question is , has she killed him yet ?
aram , get an address , get units en route now .
found my way into the crime ring .
&quot; new york &apos;s hottest bachelors &quot; ?
page 32 .
asher sutton ? i don &apos;t know who that is .
he &apos;s my fast pass to finding karakurt .
how does the only child of a billionaire resort owner
get you anywhere near the crime syndicate
where karakurt &apos;s hiding ?
trust me . it does .
i believe we &apos;ve already established
that i don &apos;t trust you .
i believe we &apos;ve also established that you need me .
look . if this world where karakurt is hiding were easy to get to ,
i &apos;d have gotten there myself .
if this asher kid somehow has access to it ,
what makes you think he &apos;s gonna take you there ?
because he &apos;s got a weakness .
for street life , hustlers , players --
anybody who has to fight for their money .
go on .
asher spends most of his nights
at an underground casino in new york .
all i need is a good story .
graduated princeton . summers in the hamptons .
maybe you should tell him
how you learned to channel lady luck in college
during a weekend bender in sag harbor .
sag harbor . okay . yeah .
yeah , you know what ? i remember that weekend .
you know , it was my junior ye--
no , it was my sophomore year .
and my roommate at princeton , sammy --
sammy ? i don &apos;t think so .
right .
not sammy .
samuel , his parents had a beach house in , uh , sag harbor ...
... that he said was flush with bikinis every summer .
so , come july , we want to get lucky , right ?
so we hit the beach , you know ,
like samuel said -- scores of girls .
but the problem is -- they &apos;re all high @-@ school girls .
right ? jailbait .
15 will get you 10 to 20 .
you know what i &apos;m saying ?
so forget it . we just drink every night .
you know , make the most of our fleeting youth .
and on the last day , we hit the beach one more time .
and there lies the most beautiful college girl
you &apos;ve ever seen .
i mean , ever .
but it &apos;s two guys , and there &apos;s one girl .
so i strike first .
i sit down , i start talking to her ,
and she says she &apos;s hungry .
so i get up , i go to the sag general to buy her a cappuccino muffin .
but when i come back , there &apos;s samuel lying on top of her
and their lips are locked like a jigsaw puzzle .
you know what i mean ?
so i do the death march back to my towel .
i &apos;m just gonna sleep off the rest of my hangover , you know ?
&quot; forget about this day . &quot; but i can &apos;t sleep .
because i got something hard stuck under my head , right ?
so i reach under my towel ,
and you &apos;re never gonna believe what i find lost in the sand .
so i go back to school the next day
with a $ 12,000 bvlgari on my wrist ,
and samuel -- he goes back with a brand @-@ new cold sore .
that &apos;s the day that i learned
that luck is just what you make of it .
that &apos;s a dope watch , mr. wainright .
you have a good evening ,
and , uh , good luck in there tonight .
hey , let &apos;s hope .
alice was right . no guards .
what ? what is it ?
you &apos;ve been quiet ever since we left alice .
is it dembe ?
it &apos;s your fantasy .
what about it ?
it &apos;s as it should be .
look at that .
pinned like a swallowtail .
oh , my .
no , no , no . let &apos;s not fuss with that now .
our priority &apos;s to find nasim .
he won &apos;t be alive . look at him . he needs medical attention .
i &apos;m not sure we should start the party
before the hostess arrives , but so be it .
yes . hello .
i need an ambulance .
a man &apos;s dying on a cross .
aram , we &apos;re five minutes out .
that &apos;s good , because a 911 call
was just placed from nasim &apos;s home ,
and the caller was mr. reddington .
are you positive ?
voice analysis confirmed it .
reddington . he &apos;s already there .
nasim . there you are .
please , come in .
we have much to discuss , and time is a factor .
what do you want ?
to offer my sympathies .
i know who you are .
and i know who you are , nasim .
what a beautiful name . it means &quot; breeze &quot; in farsi .
but you weren &apos;t born nasim .
you were born nasir -- &quot; the victorious . &quot;
how ironic .
but a boy . a perfectly healthy boy .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
alice told us the story .
we know you &apos;re the djinn .
and this must be your father .
the butcher .
tell me , bahram ,
was it so horrific to discover that your 19 @-@ year @-@ old son ,
your eldest son , was gay ?
so horrific that you forced him against his will
to go under the knife , change his gender ,
to give you a daughter instead of your son , who is gay ?
clerics accept ...
people can get trapped in the body of the wrong sex .
the law says
i wasn &apos;t trapped .
i liked my body .
i liked men .
i wanted to protect you , nasim .
they could have killed you .
for being gay .
they &apos;re so homophobic that being gay is a hideous crime ,
but chopping off a man &apos;s penis isn &apos;t ?
honestly , is it just me , or is the human race ,
armed with religion , poisoned by prejudice ,
and absolutely frantic with hatred and fear ,
galloping pell @-@ mell back to the dark ages ?
who on earth is hurt by a little girl going to school
or a child being gay ?
let &apos;s be frank , bahram .
you didn &apos;t change your son to protect him .
you changed him because he disgusted you .
that &apos;s not true .
you violated my body without consent .
you sliced out my identity
and discarded it as waste .
you cursed me to live the rest of my life
as a second @-@ class citizen ,
despite being a firstborn son .
we &apos;re running out of time .
get what you came for , and let &apos;s go .
what did you come for ?
a leather journal -- hand @-@ written --
with the names of all your clients
and their adventures in wonderland ,
but i suggest you find it fast
before the authorities outside break down your door .
what did you do ?
as a general rule ,
i &apos;m against the militarization of america &apos;s police forces ,
but i needed an army , so there they are .
i &apos;ve prepared an escape for elizabeth and i ,
and there &apos;s room for you , too ,
but the price for your freedom is one leather journal .
now who &apos;s the djinn ?
agents navabi and ressler .
where are we at ?
we set the perimeter .
our fourth side is water ,
