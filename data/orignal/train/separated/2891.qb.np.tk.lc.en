hey , guys .
so , what do you think ?
about what ?
what ?
are you kidding ? okay , i &apos;ll give you a hint .
eyes . no , no . your eyes ! no .
chandler &apos;s eyes !
i got glasses .
you always had glasses .
no , i didn &apos;t .
are you sure ?
didn &apos;t you have a pair ?
they were really round and burgundy , and they made you look kind of ...
feminine .
yes !
no .
i think the glasses look great . you look sexy .
really ?
yeah .
you didn &apos;t think i wore glasses ?
of course .
the one with phoebe &apos;s cookies
what do you want for an engagement gift ?
that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re not having a party ...
... so you don &apos;t have to get us ...
if someone wants to give us a present , we can &apos;t deprive them of that joy .
you should get them a little cd player .
i already have one .
unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist .
yeah , and by &quot; someone &quot; she means joey .
i know what i want !
what we want , honey .
no , you don &apos;t want this .
i want your grandmother &apos;s cookie recipe .
you mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe ?
the one my grandma made me swear on her deathbed ...
... that i would never let out of our family ?
dying people say the craziest things .
i &apos;ve wanted it for years . i was gonna make cookies for my children .
break my heart . oh , all right .
i &apos;ll be the mom who makes the world &apos;s best chocolate chip cookies .
our kids are gonna be fat , aren &apos;t they ?
ahoy !
how &apos;s the boat ?
i &apos;m getting into this sailing stuff .
you finally took it out of the marina ?
why would i do that ?
it took three guys to get the thing in there .
if you don &apos;t sail it , what do you do on it ?
it &apos;s a great place to just sit ...
... hang around , drink a few beers , eat some chips .
it &apos;s good that you finally have a place to do that .
i could teach you to sail if you want .
you could ?
i &apos;ve been sailing my whole life .
when i was 15 , my dad bought me my own boat .
your own boat ?
he was trying to cheer me up .
my pony was sick .
you know what i was thinking ?
what ?
nothing , i just like to go like this .
what are you doing tonight ?
do you have a lecture ?
no , why ?
then , free as a bird . what &apos;s up ?
my dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball .
great ! dad must like you !
he doesn &apos;t ask just anyone to play .
he didn &apos;t ask for you . he asked for &quot; chauncey . &quot;
i assumed he meant you .
did you correct him ?
no , i thought it would be more fun this way .
cool ! maybe you could do this every week .
or you could sit on the porch ...
... and make sure no one steals the trashcans .
he does that every week too .
just so you know , you have to let him win . he hates to lose .
maybe i &apos;ll play with my left hand .
you &apos;re not a lefty ?
does anybody know me ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i went to my old apartment to get the cookie recipe ...
... and that stupid fire burned it up !
no ! why didn &apos;t you make a copy and keep it in a fireproof box ...
... and keep it at least 100 yards away from the original ?
because i &apos;m normal .
that was the one legacy my grandmother left me .
and i know you wanted it as an engagement present .
we have to get you an engagement present ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
no one got me an engagement present .
i don &apos;t have the recipe , but here .
i wish you health and happiness .
an old cookie ?
this is what happens when you don &apos;t register for gifts .
i made a batch and froze it . this is the only one left .
we can &apos;t accept this .
why not ?
because it &apos;s gross .
no , wait . i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie .
i do this at work all the time .
really ?
i think so !
okay , ross , we owe you a present .
two ! i &apos;ve been engaged twice .
look at this clown .
he thinks he can take up the whole river .
get out of the way , jackass !
who names their boat coast guard , anyway ?
that is the coast guard .
what are they doing here ?
the coast is all the way over there .
joey , just ignore the boats .
we &apos;re not finished with our lesson .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna go over the basic points once more .
come on , rach . i got it , okay ?
i want to go over there ...
... where that boatload of girls is .
is that it ? you want to give ...
... a shout out to the hot chicas ?
okay , let &apos;s do that , sailor joe .
quick question , though : what &apos;s this called ?
boat rope ?
wrong !
how do you get the mainsail up ?
rub it ?
no . what do you do if i say we &apos;re coming about ?
i say , &quot; come again ? &quot;
i know this one . i know this one .
time &apos;s up . now you &apos;re dead .
and deaf !
you go on and make your little jokes .
if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing ...
... you will die . am i getting through to you ?
yes .
don &apos;t just say yes .
this isn &apos;t a game . you could get hurt out here !
do you want to pay attention , or do you want to die ?
i want to make a ship @-@ to @-@ shore call to chandler .
i definitely taste nutmeg .
you do ?
you don &apos;t ? well , that &apos;s the difference ...
... between a professional and a layman .
that and arrogance .
hey .
hey . how was sailing ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
you could &apos;ve at least saved me a cookie .
women are mean !
i can &apos;t believe that .
now the only thing left of my grandmother &apos;s legacy is ...
... this crumb .
i wish you a long and happy marriage .
hey .
how was it ?
well , i had a great time .
chauncey , on the other hand ...
i will tell the story .
it was going great . i let him win , we were bonding ...
... he even said i could call him dad .
and what did he ask you not to call him ?
daddy .
look , here &apos;s the story .
we had just finished playing , and we were gonna take a steam .
i walk into the room ...
... and it &apos;s really steamy .
so i take off my glasses , and that &apos;s when it happened .
guys ?
over here . - have a seat , son .
hey !
oh , my god ! i can &apos;t believe it .
i know .
you gave my father a lap dance .
why do they put so much steam in there ?
because otherwise they &apos;d have to call it the &quot; room &quot; room .
why ? why did that have to happen ?
come on , it &apos;s not that big a deal .
not that big a deal ?
there was touching of things .
i know you wanted to bond with my dad ...
... but did you have to bond to that part ?
i &apos;m sure dad doesn &apos;t care .
he probably thought it was funny .
he &apos;ll be telling this story for years .
i don &apos;t want him to tell this story for years .
oh , but he will .
he still tells the story about how monica tried to escape from fat camp .
i wasn &apos;t escaping .
then how &apos;d you get caught in the barbed wire ?
i was trying to help out a squirrel .
you were trying to eat it .
if that is your father calling to tell this story ...
... then the marriage is off !
come on . hello .
i &apos;m sorry , you have the wrong number .
i &apos;ll call you later , dad . i love you .
i &apos;m off to see your dad .
aren &apos;t you a little overdressed ?
you better make sure he tips you this time .
i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore ...
... and i figured the best way to do that was face to face .
and by &quot; face , &quot; i don &apos;t mean his lap .
and by &quot; face , &quot; i don &apos;t mean my ass .
are you getting monica and chandler a present ?
i don &apos;t know . you know , they didn &apos;t get us anything .
thank you !
hey .
well , hello .
so when are we getting back out on the water , matey ?
i don &apos;t know the boat way to say this , but never !
why not ?
because you &apos;re mean on the boat .
i was just trying to teach you .
well , lesson learned . rachel is mean .
yep , yep , yep .
i remember when she took me out on her dad &apos;s boat .
she wouldn &apos;t let me help at all .
excuse me , i wanted you to help .
but you couldn &apos;t move ...
... because you were wearing three life jackets .
you have to respect the sea .
joey , i &apos;m sorry if you thought that was mean .
but i tell you , that was not mean .
my father is mean . he used to always yell at me on the boat .
it was horrible . i was being a really good teacher .
does a good teacher say , &quot; put down the beer , pinead ! &quot;
does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson ?
six and a half .
you knocked the last one out of my hand , remember ?
i didn &apos;t want you to get hit by the boom .
well , it hit me anyway .
it would have hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer .
i &apos;m sorry . i will try to tone it down and stop yelling .
no bossing me around ?
i won &apos;t boss you around .
and be nice ?
i &apos;ll be nice .
you &apos;ll be topless ?
joey !
you want me to learn ?
here &apos;s batch 22 . maybe these are like your grandma &apos;s .
this has a bit of orange peel , but no nutmeg .
let &apos;s give it a shot .
i haven &apos;t made so many cookies since 9th grade .
what for , a bake sale ?
no , just a friday night .
these are pretty good .
yeah , but not as good as batch 17 .
which one was that ?
the ones we had after you almost threw up .
oh , yeah , batch 17 was good .
i did not like batch 16 .
i &apos;m okay .
any more from the good batch ? we could work off those .
i think there &apos;s one left .
batch 16 . sixteen , people , get out of the way !
okay , joey . you &apos;re doing really good .
i just need you to step to the portside .
remember talking about the portside ?
oh , yeah .
no .
it &apos;s left , sweetie , but that &apos;s okay . that &apos;s a tough one .
why not just say left ?
okay , go to the left .
the left .
just sit over there !
you &apos;re yelling again . see that ?
oh , no , no . very quiet . said with love , no yelling .
you know what ? since i &apos;m here , i &apos;m gonna have a beer on the portside .
see what i did there ?
we &apos;re luffing a little . can you tighten up the cunningham ?
you just said a bunch of stuff i don &apos;t know .
joey , come on ! we just went over this .
we did that when that bird ...
... flew over with the fish in his mouth .
did you see it ? it was gross .
i did not see the bird or the fish !
i did not see the piece of styrofoam shaped like mike tyson !
i did not , because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat .
which obviously is an impossible thing to do .
you &apos;re yelling , and i don &apos;t see you taking your top off .
i quit !
what do you mean ? you can &apos;t quit .
why not ?
you &apos;re not finished ! i won &apos;t have it . greens do not quit .
greens ?
i &apos;m a tribbiani . tribbianis quit .
oh , my god .
i just said , &quot; greens don &apos;t quit , &quot; didn &apos;t i ?
did i say , &quot; greens don &apos;t quit &quot; ?
yes ! and you &apos;re still yelling at me .
no , i &apos;m not yelling at you . i &apos;m just yelling near you .
oh , god , joey . i &apos;m my father .
oh , my god . this is horrible .
i try so hard not to be my mother , i didn &apos;t see this coming .
i &apos;m so sorry . i just wanted you to learn .
i did learn .
really ?
yeah , come on .
it &apos;s okay .
i know what a mainsail is .
i know to duck when the boom comes across .
i know port is right .
left .
damn it !
what are we gonna do with all these cookies ?
joey .
it would make my grandmother happy ...
... that we &apos;re trying to figure out her recipe .
i bet she &apos;s looking up at us and smiling right now .
looking up ?
she was really nice to me , but she &apos;s in hell for sure .
well , i &apos;ve tried everything .
i give up . i &apos;m not gonna be the mom ...
... who makes the world &apos;s best cookies .
i do make the best duck confit with broccoli raab .
kids love that , right ?
isn &apos;t there any relative that has the recipe ?
what about your sister ?
no . i made a promise to myself that the next time ...
... i would talk to ursula is over my dead body .
and that &apos;s not happening till october 15 , 2032 .
that &apos;s the day you &apos;re gonna die ?
i &apos;ve got shuffleboard that day .
that &apos;s what you think .
what about friends of your grandma ? wouldn &apos;t they have the recipe ?
i may have relatives in france who would know .
my grandmother said she got it from her grandmother , &quot; nestley toulouse . &quot;
what was her name ?
nestley toulouse .
nestle toll house ?
you americans always butcher the french language .
phoebe , is this the recipe ?
yes !
oh .
i cannot believe that i spent ...
... two days figuring out that recipe .
it was here the whole time !
i know ! you see , it is stuff like this ...
... which is why you &apos;re burning in hell !
so you understand .
i &apos;d feel better if you didn &apos;t tell what happened .
i &apos;m a little embarrassed about it .
i understand completely .
nothing &apos;s scarier than embarrassing yourself in front of your in @-@ laws .
as a matter of fact , when i started dating judy , i was unemployed .
her father asked me what i did for a living .
i said i was a lawyer .
what &apos;d you do when they found out ?
they never did .
so if you ever see me giving them legal advice , just nod along .
shall we ?
so , i guess we wear swimsuits in here .
well , joey , i hate to admit it ...
... your way of sailing is a lot more fun .
why don &apos;t you give a pull on that rope ?
we &apos;re not sailing .
just pull on it .
all right .
sandwiches !
what else ?
here you go .
thank you .
oh , wow .
what are you doing ?
sorry .
not like that . you &apos;re letting all the good stuff fall out .
careful ! you &apos;re wasting good pastrami !
