第一季 第四集
Daddy!
When I was a child,
my father was framed for a crime he didn't commit.
Amanda!
Amanda Clarke no longer exists.
Before he died, he left a roadmap for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lives.
I want to make this right.
Then you never should've slept with my best friend.
The "Amanda"?
Sammy named her.
Looking over dad's will.
The Stowaway is all ours now.
Tyler Barrol, Daniel's roommate at Harvard.
You're perfectly welcome to make yourself at home
at the pool house.
Thank you, Mrs. Grayson.
Only thing missing is you.
Call me sometime.
No matter what happens between us,
always be honest with you.
Most of the memories I have from childhood
are happy ones.
Warm summer days filled with love and light.
And the certainty
that even the darkest storm would eventually pass.
And for a while, at least,
they always did.
And then?
And then...
my parents' car...
went off a cliff
and...
they were both killed.
But you were not.
No.
I survived.
Clearly it's...
this early exposure to impermanence.
That makes it so difficult for you to trust
in your adult relationships.
But how do I get past that?
I mean, I really want to...
move forward with this guy at I was telling you about,
but...
I don't know. I guess I'm just afraid.
Emily, we've been circling this theme
for a year now.
It's time for you to stop playing the victim.
Time for you to start taking an active role
in your own happiness.
Until you do that,
the only thing you can expect
from this new relationship or any other
is that it will end badly.
Okay. Think about that for next week.
Thank you, Dr. Banks.
还有《基督山伯爵》的书 内涵喂
Every time I leave here, I feel...
more and more determined to take control.
Good. Then it sounds like I'm doing my job.
After over a year of treatment,
I remain skeptical that Emily will ever conquer
her trust issues.
The past continues to define her present,
and she's given me no reason to believe
that it won't define her future as well.
So you're flat-out denying it?
That I somehow hijacked your computer
and used it to blackmail Tom Kingsly?
Yes, Conrad, I am denying it.
It's no secret how much you despise the senator.
And it's no secret how many people despise you.
You're hardly one to be
throwing around these kinds of accusations.
Besides,anyone could've gotten to your laptop.
You leave it all over the place.
Now speaking of which...
Do you plan on letting me know where you're headed?
San Francisco.
Ah. Business or pleasure?
Sorry to interrupt the good times.
Daddy, your car's here.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Mm. Have a safe trip.
Thanks.
I'll be back before you know it.
Good.
I hate it when you're gone.
Not so fast, young lady.
You and I have our dress fittings
for the Mother-Daughter Tea this morning.
That's not happening. I'm meeting my friends.
You' always meeting your friends.
This charity is important to me.
My friends are important to me.
Maybe if you were nicer to yours,
you'd still have some.
Oh, watch it, Charlotte.
Hey, do me a favor,
honey, be there for your mother on this.
When I get back,we can go sailing.
You can tell me about how horrible it was.
Ugh. Fine.
Love you.
Thanks for the support.
Yes!
Whoo! Next stop Wimbledon.
Uh, pretty sure the ball was out.
I'm pretty sure you're lying.
Ah, accept defeat, Tyler.
Never. Good game. All right.
Well, what's say we all order lunch from the grill and,
uh, hit the pool, uh?
If only.
Some of us have to work for a living.
There's still heaps to prepare
for Victoria's charity tea.
Cucumber sandwiches and scones. There.
You're done.
Tell that to your mother.
She has me in charge of everything.
I rely want to wow her.
Well, then how about we all hit club tonight, huh?
Yeah, not me.
Uh, I'm trying to stay off the club circuit this summer.
And we have plans. Remember?
I'm cooking you dinner.
Yes. Of course.
I'm looking forward to it.
But you should go, Ash.
Well, it just so happens, I'm free.
Perfect.
Call you later?
Sooner's better.
Bye.
Bye.
Look who's whipped.
Contents of dad's safe deposit box.
I thought those things were supposed to be for valuables.
Where's the cash?
Right here.
"First dollar ever made at the stowaway. 1979."
Yeah, it's mom's wedding ring.
She must have given it back before she took off on him.
All right. That could be worth something.
Well, I say we hang on to the family heirlooms.
Yeah? Does that include the bar?
Yeah, we should talk about that.
What's there to talk about? Sell it.
I'll be 18 in a few months,
and I could use that money to get a place in town,
finishchool, and you--
you could finally sail off to Haiti.
You don't want to come with me?
Ah, I kinda got another adventure in mind.
What are you talng about, the rich girl?
All right. I'll tell you what.
I'll run the numbers.
We'll see what we can get for the place
once the loan's paid off.
Okay.
I mean, it could mean a whole new future for us.
I know.
The future depresses me.
Why is that?
Because I can't see things improving.
One minute Conrad's wanting to repair the damage,
and the next moment he's inflicting it.
How so?
By accusing me of ridiculous things
that aren't even worth mentioning.
Infidelity?
He knows better than to try that one
after his recent track record.
What are you thinking about?
The past.
If I promise to be good,
will you please let me see my dad?
No,
because you'd only be pretending to be good...
just like your dad pretended to be a good father.
He was a good father.
You know the truth.
Please don't leave me in here.
I promise, I'll be a good girl.
You'd just be pretending.
People who aren't who they claim to be,
Amanda, are very, very dangerous.
You would be wise to remember that.
No!
Please don't leave me.
Help me out!
Get me out!
Today we celebrate the ongoing efforts
of mothers and daughters united for "Peace of mind..."
A unique charity benefiting mental health care...
Still have your nose to the grindstone, I see.
How's it coming?
It's not can burn.
But it took the heart strings.
Nice. Connect those heart strings to the purse strings.
Emily.
I didn't know you were helping Ashley on this.
Oh, no. This is all Ash.
I came to see Daniel.
Of course you did.
Though I did purchase a ticket to your tea,
in memory of my mother.
Well, that's touching.
And when I heard that Dr. Banks was speaking
I was just... I knew I just...
I had to have a friend role seat.
And how do you know Michelle?
I've been seeing her for a year or so.
She is helping through a few things.
Mm. Well, you're in good hands.
So I imagine I'll be se you at the tea then.
I wouldn't miss it.
Hey, handsome.
Oops. Thought you were Daniel.
Ah. I'm sorry to disappoint.
I was just on my way to the fish market.
Thought I'd see how daniel felt about rock shrimp.
Ooh. Danny's allergic to shellfish.
Good thing I was here.
You coulda killed the guy.
You sure know a lot about him.
Yeah, well, best friends are like that.
Right. Harvard boys.
So where are you from exactly?
Exactly?
Nowhere anymore.
My family has estates all over the map.
Oh... Danny tells me you're an orphan.
That sucks.
Money can buy a lot of things,
but family isn't one of them.
Well, family can be overrated.
So, uh, what time do you want him?
7:00, 8:00?
You know what? I'll just give him a call.
See ya.
Did I just hear Emily?
Yeah. She just took off.
She said that something's come up
and she had to cancel dinner.
Seriously? Did she say why?
Nope.
Sorry.
Okay, so even after the estate tax,
my dad's life insurance leaves us with a decent chunk of change.
It's the dog-napper.
Hi. What are you two doing here?
I'm getting a little financial advice.
Some... I'm thinking about selling the bar.
What do you think?
I think it's none of our business, Nolan.
I think he should do what he wants.
Well, what he wants
is to use his father's insurance money
buy a boat, sail to Haiti,
and never come back.
Well, like I said, it's his choice.
And he already has a boat.
He sold the boat.
He being me.
Nolan owns the "Amanda" Now.
Mm. Funny story, actually.
Well, I'm sure you'll do
what's best for you and Sammy.
Bye.
Bye.
Jack and Emily sitting in a tree.
Really?
Kinda.
It worked.
You smiled.
Are you always in a good mood?
Yeah, when I, uh, when I see you.
Your ring's pretty girlie, don't you think?
Uh, this? Yeah. Uh...
This was my mother's,
and I'm gonna go see how much it's worth.
You'd sell your mom's wedding ring?
Trust me, there's really no sentimental value.
Charlotte?
The seamstress is ready.
Momzilla.
Hi, Mrs. Grayson.
I'm, uh, I'm Declan Porter.
Sorry to interrupt, but she has a fitting right now.
Oh, yeah? Okay, that's cool,
'cause, uh, me, too, you know.
It's a big day of fittings.
See you around, Charlotte.
The things you'll do to torture me.
It's not always about you, mom.
Hey, you've reached Daniel.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.
Hey, it's almost 9:30,
and I'm officially worried.
Where are you? Call me.
Emily.
It's about time.
That's funny.
That's what I was thinking on the way over here.
Hi.
These are from Sammy,
as a way of saying thank you for bringing him home last week...
Twice.
Well, that's very nice of Sammy, but--
Oh. I should've called first.
You're in the middle of something.
Yes, I am in the middle of something,
and that happens to be an exceptionally good bottle of pinot.
Do you drink wine?
Well, when it's exceptional,
Sure.
Cheers.
So have you made any decisions?
About the bar, I mean.
Actually, I'm, uh,
I'm gonna hold on to it for now.
Postpone any major decisions till the end of the season.
Why is that?
Well, I guess I'm...
just hoping to find
a really good reason to stick around.
A better reason than the stowaway?
If I'm lucky.
Michelle.
Oh. Everything is exquisite.
But I've come to expect nothing less from you.
Oh, thank you. Well, it takes a village, right?
The narration you did for the video presentation is perfect.
Oh, I'm happy to do my part for the cause.
Oh, Michelle, you know Miriam and Everly.
Oh, she ought to. I'm in her office once a week.
Oh, excuse me.
Charlotte,
the presentation is about to begin,
and I need you here by my side right now.
Please do not disappoint me today, I beg of you.
Do you understand?
Wouldn't dream of it.
Thank you.
Hey, Ash.
Is everything okay?
No, everything is definitely not okay.
I'm as hungover as a French Sailor,
and now I've lost the bloody DVD.
Okay. Well, don't worry. I'll help you.
It was right here.
Did you check the dvd play?
No.
Found it.
Thank you. I am never dinking again.
I take it that you and Tyler had a good time?
Mm. Too much. He is a madman.
How was dinner with Daniel?
It wasn't. I got stood up.
And now he's not answering his phone.
You're kidding. Prince charming?
Something must have happened.
I'm sure, but we can talk about that later
because you have some dazzling to do.
Excuse me.
Oh, great. Now I'm hallucinating.
I'll handle him.
I'm getting pretty sick of you
sticking your nose where it doesn't belong, Nolan.
I know you've been whispering in Jack Porter's ear.
Don't involve him in this.
I heard you two had a perfectly lovely evening
and...
nice to know you can let your guard down once in a while.
Who knew you could cook?
Good afternoon, ladies,
and welcome to the 15th annual Mother-daughter Tea.
Show's starting.
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I... smell the distinct aroma
of retribution in the air.
As you know, today's event...
Mothers and daughters only.
Oh, there you are.
Have you seen my cell phone anywhere?
Oh, I have seen many a thing
the last 24 hours, my friend.
Your phone is not among them.
You and Ashley party it up?
Oh, yes.
But she had that tea thing this morning,
so I cashed her out early,
and somehow ended up in the back of a limo
with half a dozen real housewives.
By the time I sobered up,
I was in friggin' Newark.
You were definitely missed.
Sounds like you did just fine without me.
Mm. You, uh...
Did you ever connect with Emily?
Uh, no, I did not.
After you left, I went over to find out why she canceled,
and get this--
She's over there with some other guy.
Yeah, not the first time I've seen him hanging around, either.
What a bitch.
If it helps,
I smelled that one coming a mile away.
Doesn't help.
Well, maybe this will.
Oh, come on. The Daniel Grayson I know
drinks this kind of thing off
and moves on to the next in line.
I-I don't think so.
Let me ask you something.
When's the last time you woke up craving drink?
Uh, never.
That's because, despite what mommy and daddy say,
you're not an alcoholic.
You're just a guy that likes to have a good time.
And now you're unattached again.
So...
Bottoms up.
There we go.
Hello, Conrad.
May I come in?
Of course.
I see you've set yourself up nicely.
Thanks to you.
Can I get you a drink?
I have a plane to catch.
Then what are you doing here?
I take it you heard about Senator Kingsly's
fund-raiser.
Who didn't?
Seems a little young for her retirement.
Ah, well, the retirement wasn't exactly voluntary.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
All I know is that Victoria thought
to include my ex-husband on the guest list.
Was that to get back at you
Or me?
I don't know. Both, perhaps.
Truth is, things have become so ugly between us,
she seems capable just about anything.
What is clear is that
she's still very suspicious of you.
And after the way you came at me for that check,
I guess I was, too.
I should've never back you to a corner like that.
Hey, Victoria backed you into a corner
I don't blame you for showing your claws.
Thanks to the dedicated effort
of founding mother Victoria Grayson,
Your generous donations today ensure that
low-income special needs children
are provided top-notch
mental health care close to home
And now please enjoy this very special video presentation,
which illustrates just how vital an effort this is.
Today we celebrate
the ongoing efforts of Mothers and Daughters.
United for "Peace of mind,"
a unique charity benefiting
mental health care facilities and--
And have you hit bottle?
Close.
I drove my children to summercamp
loaded on painkills and Vodka.
Hamptonsexposed.
How can I explaind to my husband
that I slept with his sister?
He--he's never gonna forgive
Turn it off.
It takes a lot for me to get physical with anybody.
Oh, my god.
I just wish I knew for sure that I could trust him.
How's your relationship with your daughter?
Tense...distant.
The truth is, I've never really
felt close to Charlotte.
Sometimes i wonder if having a second child
was a mistake.
Charlotte, wait.
No. I'm done dressing up
and pretending to be someone I'm not.
You wish I was never born?
That makes two of us.
Victoria, I--
I didn't--
You recorded my private sessions?
For my own use.
I am going to destroy you.
Someone must have--I--
I am going to ruin you!
Victoria, I... I don't...
Did she just threaten her?
Did you hear it, too?
Collect those recordings
and get them to me by the end of the day,
Or I swear to god, Michelle,
I will not only sue you,
I will make you suffer
every single day for the rest of your miseble life!
You gotta think clearly, Victoria.
It's not in your best interest
to leave threatening voice mails.
That woman can expose far worse than
my troubled relationship
with Charlotte.
Like what?
What does she know?
Too much.
Okay, Victoria.
Don't go anywhere. Don't speak to anyone.
I'll be back in an hour.
I've known Amanda Clarke's family
for quite some time, and...
With her father's arrest for that horrible crime,
I think it's best for everyone involved
that Amanda be institutionalized.
Well, I'll be the to make that determination.
Of course, doctor.
I imagine how difficult it must be for you
to handle cases like this.
They're-- they're heartbreaking.
It's the job.
What if you had a different kind of job?
What if I offered you a private practice
with a steady stream of the right kind of clients?
I could be your first patient.
In return,
you see to it that amanda gets the care she needs
in a proper institution.
But more importantly,
That she and her father remain separated for good.
What's your best price?
I already told you.
What's going on?
Sweet, huh?
I was just thinking, for when I get my share of the bar,
I could, uh--
I'm sorry to put you out, man.
We're not buying. Come here.
What are you doing? What's the big deal?
The big deal, Declan, is you're not even 18 yet,
so you're not even legally able to drive that thing,
and secondly, and more importantly,
I'm putting a pin in the plans to sell the bar.
Since when is that your decision?
What, I-I don't get a say?
I'm the adult here, Declan.
And I'm your guardian, so, no, you don't.
We'll talk about it again at the end of the summer
when I gety boat back.
That's forever.
You'll be fine.
Oh, what the hell are we doing in this dump, huh?
You're Emily's friend, right?
Jack.
You lookin' for emily?
We're just looking for a good time, Jack.
I take it there's no cover tonight.
Come on, Danny.
Excuse me. Bartender, could we get a drink?
You have really outdone yourself.
Your hamptonsexposed link
is a work of art.
And sliding your own therapy session into the mix
to throw suspicion...
Genius.
I mirrored the site
and posted a few clones
just to make sure it never dies.
Thank you.
Now go befo someo sees you.
Victoria watches this place like a hawk.
I also did some, uh,
research into your collateral damage.
Seems Dr. Banks wasn't always
the go-to shrink for the rich and demented.
She began her road to infamy
as a court-appointed child psychologist.
Random coincidence?
Nothing's random, Nolan.
Well...
You can be satisfied the good doctor will...
never practice again.
Count on it.
Charlotte's phone. Leave a message.
Charlotte, darling, what you heard today
was taken completely out of context
by someone who has a vicious agenda against me.
Please...
Come home the instant you hear this message.
Southampton police.
Are you Victoria Grayson?
Yes.
I'm detective Robert Gunther, southampton police department.
This is my associate here, officer Gibbs.
M-my god. Is it my daughter?
This is about Michelle Banks.
What happened?
That's what we'd like to find out.
We need to ask you a few questions.
May we come in?
Yes.
Several witnesses confirmed
that you publicly threated Dr. Banks.
Hours later, she placed a call to 9-1-1 from her office,
which we found ransacked.
I threaten to ruin her, not inflict bodily harm.
Do I look like a kidnapper to you?
Well, you look like
a woman with unlimited resources
Frank, thank god.
Would you please talk to these men?
Detective, could we have a word?
Detective.
Look, I can vouch
for Mrs. Grayson's whereabouts all afternoon.
We were together, if you get my meaning.
Ah, so you're Mr. Gray
No
I work for him.
I worked for the bureau before that.
Are you charging her?
We're just asking questions.
It sounds like she's answered 'em.
Let's go, Gibbs.
Mrs. Grayson, I suggest you stay put.
I can't believe this is happening.
Where have you been?
I went to dr. Banks' office.
The police were all over it.
Okay, her computer and external hard drives are missing.
So it's out there? It's everywhere?
It's okay. This is why we're gonna get to her
before the police do.
I want you to call your assistant.
Have her put together a list
of anyone who had access to that video.
Thank you, Frank.
I wouldn't know what to do without you.
Then call your husband.
He needs to know what's going on.
I'll get us some more wine.
All right, you miss this, we lose...
to two chicks.
No pressure.
Thanks. I got it.
Doesn't count unless you call it.
8-ball, side pocket.
You mean...
This pocket?
Oh, my god.
Looks like your luck just ran out.
You played dirty.
Oh, I can get a lot dirtier.
What are frick and frack doing here?
Getting loaded.
And laid by the looks of things.
Yo, bartender! Another round of shots on Danny's tab, okay?
Amanda.
I asked you to draw something different today.
This is another picture of you and your father.
Take me to see him, and then I'll draw anything you want.
You know you will never see that man again.
Tell me why.
Because they took him away.
Because he hurt people.
Because he killed people.
That's a lie.
They did it.
There is no "They," Amanda.
If you don't stop challenging me on this,
You might wind up spending the rest of
your childhood in this place.
Is that what you want?
I want to see my daddy.
Evening, Ems.
Thought you'd be amused to know
that your fake boyfriend is busy making
a drunken ass of himself
at your other boyfriend's bar.
I'm gonna have to cut you guys off.
What?
What are you talking about? You can't do that.
Boys will be boys.
Come on down. Testosterone's on the house.
I have a confession to make.
Sometime shortly before we started,
The DVD...
Went missing.
Missing?
I thought that I had misplaced it,
But, um, we found it in the dvd player,
And I chalked it up to a moment of absentmindedness.
We?
Emily and I.
She thought to checkthe tray in the player
And saved the day.
Or not, as it turns out.
Why isn't her name on your list?
You can't possibly think that Emily had anything
to do with this.
Besides, she was a victim, too.
and we'll roll
roll that crimson
Daniel.
What happened?
Captain jack happened.
And that is all the time
I have for questions tonight.
Good night, sports fans.
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Grayson. I tried to stop him, but--
Well, you know how he gets.
I, uh, I thought it was better to stay with him,
keep him from doing anything stupid.
You know, like last summer.
Well, suddenly last summer's
beginning to look like a cake walk.
See to it he falls asleep face down.
I'll start on these.
What's going on here?
A very long story.
Suffice to say, we both spent our nights
neck deep in Grayson drama.
You really are sober, aren't you?
As a judge.
Police now believe the same person
is behind the hamptonsexposed web site
and the break in at Dr. Banks' office.
When asked about suspects in her disappearance,
Detective said they had a list
as long as Dr. Banks' patient roster.
If you have any information...- Where's daniel?
I'd say, uh,
the more pressing mystery
is the whereabouts of Dr. Banks.
If you have any information that could help authorities
on her whereabouts,
Please call the action news crime line. - Hey
You just missed your friends.
I heard.
I'm sorry.
It's fine. It's a bar.
It's no big deal.
Can I get you something?
I mean, I can't offer you a gourmet meal,
but we do carry several not-so-pricey wines.
Not tonight, but thank you.
Man, she's a--
She's a tough one to figure out.
She's got issues.
Got nothing but...
Nice things to say about you, though.
What are you talking about?
See for yourself.
Please listen to me.
It was never my intention to hurt anyone today.
So, whoever you are,
please, I am begging you,
just let me out of here so that we can talk.
Can you hear me?
Is there anybody out there?!
Can you hear me?
Please let me out of here.
Who the hell are you?
In a surprise twist,
in an already incredible story,
an anonymous tip to the Action News Crime Line
led South Hampton police
right to the missing Dr. Michelle Banks,
who was pulled from this storage facility just moments ago.
Cops have been on the scene,
combing this area for hours,
trying to gather up evidence and looking for suspects.
We do know that Dr. Banks is okay.
We have not yet been able to--
She's been by my side the whole night.
And what can you tell me about where that tip came from?
Well, thank you for your time, detective.
They're saying Michelle never got a look at her attacker,
but they're gonna want to follow with you.
Why?
Because the storage unit that she was found in
was registered to Grayson Global.
What the hell is going on here, Frank?
I don't know.
But I'm gonna get to the bottom of it,
I promise.
Frank.
Would you spend the night here?
I don't want to be alone in this house.
I mean, I always knew things were weird between us,
but I never thought...
she actually hated me.
Nah, hey, come on. That's not what she said.
Yeah, right.
She said she wished I had never been borned,
which is worse.
I always knew Daniel was her favorite.
Yeah, all right, trust me,
I-I have an older brother, too,
so I know the feeling.
Only now mine's my guardian.
So what happened to your mom?
She left.
Yeah, when I was, like, 2.
I don't even remember her.
Jack does, but he doesn't talk about her.
I don't know,
maybe that's what kept me from hocking her ring.
Like some stupid part of me
thinks she's gonna come back for it.
Can I see?
Well, if it matters,
you wouldn't have gotten much for it.
It's fake.
Oh, it figures.
But you know what?
It's priceless to you,
and that's so much more important.
You should go home,
and work it out with your mom.
At least you have one, right?
Dr. Banks, you must be relieved.
I'll be relieved
when the sick person who nocked my unconscious
and locked me up is apprehended.
Until then,
it seems Dr. Banks will be looking over her shoulder
wondering not if, but when
her attacker might strike again.
We will stay...
The greatest weapon anyone can use against us
is our mind,
by preying on the doubts and uncertainties
that already lurk there.
Are we true to ourselves?
Or do we live for the expectations of others?
And if we are open and honest,
can we ever truly be loved?
Now I've met this guy, and...
even though I don't know him very well,
I-I have this strange feeling,
that... he could be the one.
It's just a feeling that I-I get.
Can we find the courage to release our deepest secrets?
Sleep tight, buddy.
Or in the end...
are we all unknowable...
What are you thinking about?
The past,
even to ourselves?
