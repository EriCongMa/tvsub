ellen agreed to help me look into my father
before she disappears into witsec again .
it &apos;s now or never .
we found a gun
with your dad &apos;s prints on it .
he killed a cop ?
he confessed .
did you believe him ?
ellen !
they found me .
who ?
trust sam .
trust sam .
may her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed ,
through the mercy of god , rest in peace .
amen .
amen .
i &apos;m so sorry .
first time i met ellen , she slammed the door in my face .
she was protecting you .
we &apos;ll figure out who did this , neal .
there &apos;s a man ellen was supposed to meet .
he might know .
he &apos;s an undercover cop . she used to work with him .
what do you know about him ?
all i got is a name-- sam .
but chances are whoever he was investigating is behind this .
not much to go on .
maybe not .
but i think he &apos;s here right now .
how do you want to handle this ?
sam !
that &apos;s one way to do it .
i &apos;ll go around .
yep .
ellen &apos;s favorite flower .
paying respect from afar .
wouldn &apos;t you ?
coming in town for a secret meeting
to find the woman i was supposed to meet is ...
yeah , i guess i &apos;d be easily spooked .
i need to find him-- let him know we &apos;re on his side .
how did ellen do it ?
she didn &apos;t tell me .
well , if this were a normal case ,
i &apos;d start in her apartment .
great . let &apos;s go .
no , no , no . hold on . hold on .
the marshals have control of the case .
it &apos;s on complete lockdown .
all right , well , they have to make digital copies
of all of her personal effects for the crime @-@ scene report .
if you can get that , we might have a lead .
it won &apos;t be easy . i can &apos;t promise anything .
peter ...
sam is my best shot at finding out who killed ellen .
i need to find him .
holding a one @-@ man irish wake ?
i figured it was apropos for a woman of ellen &apos;s fortitude .
she wasn &apos;t irish .
she was a cop . close enough .
we need to do something .
peter is coordinating with the marshals .
the marshals aren &apos;t gonna share with the suit .
they &apos;re notoriously protective .
probably because of their involvement with--
i &apos;m not in the mood for conspiracy theories , moz .
i was gonna say prisoner transfer--
alien prisoner transfer .
we do this peter &apos;s way ...
for now .
first case back .
how does it feel ?
like the higher @-@ ups are watching
and waiting for me to screw up .
sounds like fun .
it is .
so we need a clean , old @-@ fashioned win .
that &apos;s why caffrey &apos;s not here ?
ah , he &apos;s grieving .
i want to give him time to process it .
you think that &apos;s a bad idea ?
well , you know , personally , i &apos;d keep him close--
keep an eye on him .
idle hands and all that .
i can keep an eye on him with his anklet .
looks like he &apos;s ...
right here .
idle hands .
i &apos;ll go check on the van .
thanks , jones .
you &apos;re supposed to be taking some time off .
come on , peter .
i need to keep busy .
besides , i never pass up a chance
to go into the kessman museum .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re not allowed in
without an fbi escort .
listen , they &apos;re watching me on this one .
we need to do things strictly by the book .
by the book . i swear .
all right , take a look at this .
an ax @-@ 5000 ?
it &apos;s a cutting @-@ edge black box
designed to circumvent the best security systems out there .
you shouldn &apos;t have , peter .
i didn &apos;t . it &apos;s not a gift .
give it back . it &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
a janitor found this in the basement last night
attached to a junction box .
it &apos;s set to shut off security today at 3 : 00 p.m.
so someone in the museum is gonna try to make off
with a priceless piece of contemporary art .
and we need to figure out who .
all right , we have a mystery thief
and an unknown target within the museum .
what we do know is that the thief thinks
the alarm will turn off in 30 minutes .
our best bet is to identify
him before that and catch him in the act .
neal , since you &apos;re here ,
you and i will be on the floor as museum patrons .
i have access to all the museum cameras from here .
they had to make the uniform out of polyester , didn &apos;t they ?
and diana will go under as a docent .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s more plausible
if you and diana were the patrons ?
i mean , a happy couple visiting the museum .
she thinks warhol &apos;s cool .
you think , &quot; a can of soup &apos;s a can of soup . &quot;
you want to be the docent .
listen , if you guys think that &apos;s best , i &apos;m happy--
we don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t think i can do it .
no , i think you &apos;ll be great .
i mean , i &apos;m sure you know
what year rodin finished &quot; gates of hell . &quot;
1917 .
trick question ! he never finished that piece .
trick answer-- he died in 1917,
which means he was as done as he would ever be .
what if we were both docents ?
the museum doesn &apos;t want neal caffrey , infamous art thief ,
dressed as one of their employees .
and suddenly i find myself rooting for our mystery thief .
what do you think--
fake baby and a stroller full of tools ?
she &apos;s wearing sandals .
it &apos;s not ideal footwear for a robbery .
too slappy ?
what do you think of this familiar piece ?
whoever painted it has raw talent .
the security here is top @-@ notch .
boiler @-@ plate screws hold each painting frame to the wall .
even with the alarms off ,
you wouldn &apos;t have time to remove it ,
and cutting it out drastically reduces the value .
all right .
so how would you steal something ?
i &apos;d spill my drink on it .
museum staff would be forced to move it
to the restoration room .
much less security back there .
fewer eyes , and if i timed it right ,
they &apos;d have already fixed it up good as new .
you &apos;d still need to get it out .
i &apos;d time the guards and wait for an opening .
all right , so we &apos;re looking for a guy carrying a big gulp
and checking his watch .
he &apos;d have to be discreet .
good guards are trained to look for watch checkers .
once i got the painting out of the back ,
it &apos;s a matter of hiding it in something innocuous .
i might carry it in a souvenir bag , or ...
am i boring you ?
that woman over there --
it could be a really good song ...
or she &apos;s timing the guards .
good eye , peter .
i don &apos;t see any drinks on her or tools of any kind .
what if she doesn &apos;t need them ?
the chagall exhibit starts next week .
the pieces are already here -- back in the storeroom ,
where there &apos;s fewer security measures .
that &apos;s what i &apos;d target .
all right , i &apos;m gonna look over security footage
and see where she &apos;s been .
you can go join diana .
oh . you think she needs my help ?
no , i just don &apos;t like you
walking around here without a chaperone .
wow , that is beautiful .
can you give me a lengthy , detailed history of this piece ?
well , this particular artist
wanted an excuse to stare at naked women all day .
now you &apos;re not even trying .
i don &apos;t need to try . i won .
any suspects yet ?
nine o &apos;clock .
cute . mm @-@ hmm .
damn , she made me .
what , she knows you &apos;re fbi ?
nope .
then what are you ...
absolutely stunning .
it is ... stunning ... and challenging .
i like the sound of that .
it &apos;s an intriguing piece .
her collapsing form ,
the shadow dragging her down as she slowly fades away --
it invokes a heartbreaking sense of melancholy .
i disagree .
i find it bold , yet still sensual .
i &apos;m abigail .
diana .
do you come here often ?
to the museum , i mean .
i don &apos;t .
but i think i need to start .
do we have eyes on our suspect ?
yes , we do . and she has eyes on diana .
is she getting diana &apos;s phone number ?
who would stop in the middle of a museum robbery
to get a date ?
don &apos;t say it .
don &apos;t bother .
excuse me ?
you can stop working the docent . you &apos;re not her type .
i think you got the wrong idea .
oh . oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought i was talking to neal caffrey .
and if you were ?
i &apos;d tell him i &apos;m a fan ...
and that it &apos;s sad to see him in an anklet .
look , i got caught , served my time ,
but it &apos;s still nice to visit a museum ,
reminisce about the old days .
you got out of the game .
what a loss .
all i can do is live vicariously through others .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
keep an eye on her . let &apos;s see where she goes .
copy that .
flirting , giving kids a tour .
we sure this is our thief ?
where &apos;s she headed ?
let me see .
why , you think she &apos;s on to us ?
i &apos;m not sure what she &apos;s thinking .
the kid touched the art .
where &apos;s abigail ?
she &apos;s leaving the building .
this is abigail kincaid .
she &apos;s a personal shopper
for the wealthiest of new york &apos;s wealthy .
we think she &apos;s moved
from personal shopping to personal thieving .
it &apos;s smart angle .
she doesn &apos;t need a fence because she already knows the buyers .
sounds like you got a crush .
she &apos;s been linked to a couple of art heists in the past ,
but nothing ever sticks .
we think she usually works alone ,
but today she had an accomplice .
looks like a hardened criminal to me .
she paid him $ 20
to count to 20 and touch the art .
she sees neal caffrey , art thief ,
wonders if her heist has gotten a little crowded .
and she calls an audible .
she &apos;s going to assume
either you found the black box and disarmed it
or the authorities did .
either way , she &apos;ll need another way in .
well , it looks like i &apos;m itch .
she &apos;s already sent me a couple of text messages .
diana , i want you to set up a date with her .
i &apos;ll give abigail a call now .
where you going ?
we should listen ... so we learn more about her .
aw , she &apos;s nervous .
she plays with her hair when she &apos;s nervous .
ah , i hadn &apos;t noticed .
that &apos;s because she &apos;s rarely nervous .
all right , let &apos;s give her some space .
everybody , take five .
neal , stick around .
you got your bad @-@ news face on .
i spoke with the marshals earlier .
they &apos;re willing to cooperate on a very limited basis .
look , it &apos;s a start .
well , go above their head , peter .
submit an fd @-@ 125 to the unit chief .
someone already did their homework ,
and i already tried that .
we can &apos;t lose him .
i know . give me time .
i don &apos;t have time !
i knew it . i brought you in too early .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll get myself under control .
come on , art , help me out here .
all right , all right , all right .
yeah , let me know if anything changes .
another dead end with the marshals ?
yeah , the deadest so far .
this case is on complete lockdown .
no one &apos;s willing to stick their necks out .
well , you tried . that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
i &apos;m not so sure .
you should see the look in his eyes , el .
i &apos;m not looking to close this case .
i just want to find a way to contact this sam guy .
neal &apos;s in a unique position . he could reach out to him .
he may be the only person that sam could trust .
well ...
you &apos;ll figure it out . you always do .
the crime @-@ scene report is in a database on the 22nd floor .
now , somewhere in that file ,
there has to be a way to reach sam .
hopefully it can tell us who killed ellen and why .
the security is good .
i &apos;m already looking for the blueprints for that building .
i can &apos;t go in there with my anklet on .
i shouldn &apos;t even be this close .
but the suit &apos;s taken it off many times before .
no , not this time .
you don &apos;t look like you &apos;re out of the game .
you &apos;re a hard man to track down , neal caffrey .
to what do we owe this honor ?
i &apos;ve got a proposition for you .
so what is it exactly you propose ?
i prefer to talk alone .
i should really frisk her for weapons before i go .
try and i &apos;ll break your little fingers .
she &apos;s clean .
your friend doesn &apos;t look like a fed .
he &apos;ll be happy to hear that .
you didn &apos;t get out of the game , did you ? you switched sides .
what makes you think that ?
the alarm at the kessman goes off , and you &apos;re inside .
they &apos;d still be questioning you , and yet here you are .
if i was working with them ,
why would i be here right now , casing a score ?
because you &apos;re just like me . you always want something .
mm . and what do you want ?
pascal &apos;s &quot; wistful mobile . &quot;
i &apos;m familiar with it . and impressed .
because it &apos;s on a stand , it doesn &apos;t have
the traditional museum security .
unfortunately , i can &apos;t go back into the museum .
but you can .
you want me to steal it .
in exchange , i steal something for you .
that &apos;s the marshals &apos; building , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s a tricky one .
what &apos;s inside that &apos;s so valuable ?
a file on a woman named ellen parker .
that wasn &apos;t so hard to admit , was it ?
i &apos;m not interested .
yes , you are .
i can see it in your eyes .
look , this is important to you .
let me ... help you ...
so that you can help me .
i didn &apos;t think i was your type .
you &apos;re not .
but hopefully you can satisfy a different need .
the pascal for the file .
i need to think about it .
don &apos;t think too long .
diana &apos;s date with abigail is tonight .
while there , she &apos;ll float the idea of a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes tour .
that gives abigail an opportunity to access the back room .
and we control the situation the entire time .
is that abigail again ?
no , it &apos;s christie .
does she know about this ?
i figured i &apos;d wait till afterwards to tell her .
that &apos;s usually my strategy .
why is that not comforting ?
go ahead and take it . that &apos;s all , everyone .
what are you thinking of ?
i was just thinking about what to do with abigail .
i &apos;m surprised she &apos;s moving so quickly .
well , if she has a buyer lined up , why wait ?
explore every option , see if a better one comes up .
hard to imagine a better one
than having the docent lead you right to your score .
she &apos;s not nervous this time .
not happy , either .
well , not our place to pry .
why do i feel like i &apos;ve entered a crime scene ?
oh , sorry about the hats .
art requires sacrifice ,
and haberdasher &apos;s not on my resume .
here , try this on .
okay , now hit the switch on the band .
the headless con man .
how &apos;d you do it ?
infrared l.e.d.s imbedded in the hat --
invisible to the naked eye
and yet make your face invisible to the digital one .
all right .
oh , what about this ?
handle with care .
that &apos;s an olfactory assault weapon for distraction purposes .
a homemade stink bomb .
that has an elegant subtlety to its noxious odor .
is all this for the pascal or the marshals &apos; office ?
either .
but you &apos;d be crazy to turn down the lady &apos;s deal .
i can &apos;t steal something right under peter &apos;s nose .
well , you &apos;ve done it before . and you can again .
remember , this is for the greater good .
the suit will understand that eventually .
well , it might not matter .
abigail kept her date with diana .
it could be an angle .
well , they think she &apos;s going after the collection in the back .
only you know the true target .
she decides to make a move on the pascal tonight ,
they &apos;ll be blindsided .
she &apos;ll have the pascal , and i won &apos;t get the drive .
personal shopping is the worst .
and the people i work for never know what they want .
they &apos;ve got no taste .
but they &apos;ve got money .
two years ago , i had this client
that bought a litvak original for $ 200,000 .
i &apos;ve never heard of litvak .
i &apos;m not surprised .
he was the homeless guy outside my apartment .
it &apos;s still my client &apos;s favorite piece .
i &apos;m starting to like her .
i &apos;m adding fraud to the list of charges against her .
you know , you should come by again .
i &apos;ll show you behind the scenes and everything .
what ?
you &apos;re hiding something .
that &apos;s never good .
what do you mean ?
you told me about taking up tai chi ,
seeing &quot; the book of mormon , &quot; taking a pottery class .
so ?
well , the stories are all missing one thing --
the person you were with .
you &apos;re dating someone , aren &apos;t you ?
i am .
and yet you &apos;re here with me .
i &apos;ve been seeing someone for a little while ,
but lately ...
we don &apos;t even talk to each other anymore .
it &apos;s like we exist next to each other .
oh , this is awkward .
probably just a story .
i should have said something earlier ,
but i was having a nice time .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
i mean , i am ...
but ...
why don &apos;t we lighten the mood a bit ?
tell me about that behind @-@ the @-@ scenes tour .
well , uh ...
the chagall exhibit for next week &apos;s already at the museum .
are you offering me a sneak peek ?
we could go right now .
um ... you know , i &apos;d love to , but ...
i shouldn &apos;t tonight .
i hope it wasn &apos;t what i said .
no , it wasn &apos;t . i promise .
how about tomorrow instead ?
sounds good .
tomorrow it is .
why not tonight ?
if this is about you and elizabeth ,
i don &apos;t want to get involved .
abigail .
why tomorrow ?
maybe she wants the heat to die down .
or she could be waiting to see if there &apos;s a better way in .
i suppose .
by the way , i want this case to close soon .
yeah .
what ?
the marshals aren &apos;t gonna give us the information , arthey ?
it doesn &apos;t look like it .
we &apos;ll find another way to get in contact with sam .
there &apos;s always a way .
yeah .
i hope that &apos;s a celebratory glass .
nice place .
i thought a lot about your offer .
but i &apos;m not gonna take it .
oh . you &apos;re staying out of the game after all .
i am .
more importantly , you should walk away from the pascal .
you won &apos;t get away with it .
well , what about ellen parker ?
i &apos;ll find a way .
you don &apos;t need one .
you already broke in .
i &apos;ve got everything you want .
it &apos;s ready for you just as soon as you get me the pascal .
no .
i &apos;m not gonna do it .
that &apos;s a shame because right now the marshals have no idea
that anyone broke in and stole this information ,
but i could always call them .
and what ?
file an eyewitness report ?
no , see , i don &apos;t have to do a thing
because they &apos;ll search that room
and they &apos;ll find strands of your hair under the data server .
and put that together with the anklet outside the building --
i think you &apos;re going away for a really long time .
you &apos;re blackmailing me ?
look , we both get what we want , neal .
you &apos;ve got 24 hours .
i did my part . now you do yours .
to most people look at the mobile ,
it &apos;s no more than a series of objects that move .
to a few , though , it may be poetry .
alexander calder -- he pioneered kinetic sculpture ,
and pascal pushed the envelope even further .
and i wish i &apos;d told peter everything from the beginning .
you couldn &apos;t have seen this coming . she set you up well .
probable cause ,
my anklet putting me at the scene , dna --
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;d believe me .
it &apos;s a hole too deep to climb out of .
the only other option is to keep digging .
all right , well , this is gonna be tricky .
peter will expect me to be standing right next to him the entire time .
and so you shall ... until ...
we give him something to chase .
all right . all right .
well , when they see that image in the monitor , they &apos;ll pursue ,
but they &apos;ll still be able to track your movements .
yeah ? let them try .
nice , moz .
nice . all right , that will buy me some time .
next , i &apos;ll disassemble the pascal .
the real one is exponentially larger .
getting it out is gonna be a problem .
we don &apos;t have time to plan a rooftop escape .
and neither one of us can carry it out .
moz , grab that serving tray from the coffee table .
all right .
critics say modern art
is a series of arbitrary shapes and colors --
trash ...
that someone decided to call art .
yes , i &apos;m well aware of the plebeian opinion .
let &apos;s prove them right .
hey , relax . you look great .
i &apos;m not trying to look great . i &apos;m trying to look the part .
diana , if you need ---
look , i know you overheard my conversation with abigail .
i was just playing a role .
the best cons come from a place of truth .
this isn &apos;t the time , caffrey .
if you ever want to talk -- that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
ladies and gentlemen , abigail has arrived .
wish me luck .
luck .
all right . excellent .
i checked your anklet the other day .
did you notice i was outside the marshals &apos; new york office ?
that i did .
i didn &apos;t set foot inside that building .
no , you don &apos;t have to set foot inside a building to case it .
i &apos;m not gonna break in , peter .
but you were tempted .
i was .
but i decided that ...
your way is the best way .
peter ...
all right .
when she gains access to the back room ,
diana will give her a window to make the theft .
she makes her move , we &apos;ll move in to arrest her .
is that it ? is there no security ?
i &apos;ll be keeping my eye on you .
sounds good to me .
all right , get ready .
this is where she should make her move .
oh , she sure did .
what are you doing ?
sorry .
i just wasn &apos;t expecting it .
i don &apos;t get it .
are we watching a date or a heist ?
peter , you need to take a look at room 2 .
get agents in that room right now !
and keep an eye on abigail !
fbi . you two guys head that way .
mike , over this way .
peter , he &apos;s on the third floor now .
all security to the third floor .
all security to the third floor .
he &apos;s back on the first floor .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
jones , any eyes on him ?
now all the cameras are jammed .
god .
she got the pascal !
spread out ! everyone on an exit !
yes , sir .
lock this whole place down !
all right . move out on 42 .
how the hell did this happen ?
you check the roof ?
it &apos;s the weakest security point on any museum .
somebody check the roof .
copy that .
she knew we were watching her .
and while she had the perfect alibi ,
her accomplices took this right from under our noses .
to pull this off , she had to have an inside man .
what i can tell ,
there were at least two accomplices .
l.e.d.s to hide their faces .
and a video jammer to black out the camera .
it doesn &apos;t explain how they got the pascal out .
maybe it &apos;s still in the museum --
behind a false wall or disguised as a different piece of art .
hiding in plain sight ? maybe .
so , i finished interviewing the museum staff .
any suspects ?
not yet . we &apos;ll keep digging .
but so far , they &apos;re coming up clean .
maybe we should take a break --
just come back to it with fresh eyes .
ah , you can go . i &apos;m staying .
i &apos;m missing something in these videos .
there &apos;s something here .
see you tomorrow .
see ya .
or there isn &apos;t something .
neal .
quite the air of melancholy after a successful heist .
i want to get this done .
when &apos;s the exchange ?
tomorrow morning .
and the suit ?
probably still at the office going over video .
i was standing right next to him , moz .
peter made it so i could come back to new york ,
and in return , i stabbed him in the back .
it &apos;s just a piece of art , neal .
weighed against finding out who killed ellen ?
you &apos;re right .
we &apos;ll make the drop , and we &apos;ll put this behind us .
is there an update on the case or something ?
can i come in ?
please .
i &apos;m gonna need one of those .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ve been undercover a lot .
this has never happened to me before .
this is about you and abigail .
you were right . i did tell her the truth .
only i didn &apos;t know it was the truth
until i started saying it .
well , if you avoid something long enough ,
it has a tendency to blindside you .
that &apos;s why i came here .
i figured you of all people would understand .
more than you know .
it &apos;s been exciting , you know ?
pretending to be single ,
not feeling guilty because it &apos;s part of the job .
yeah , getting into character and then discovering ...
it &apos;s not really a character anymore .
i feel like i &apos;m running in two different directions ,
and once i stop ...
i &apos;m gonna have to face reality .
then never stop running .
i tried .
and the minute you do ,
it &apos;s not just gonna catch up to you , it &apos;s gonna run you over .
what if you want to stop running ?
you have to give something up .
okay , thanks .
so our agents confirmed eyes on abigail .
she &apos;s at the hotel . been there all night .
and neal ?
well , let &apos;s take a look .
well , he &apos;s still at home , according to the anklet .
i got your text . what &apos;s up ?
going through the video ,
i &apos;ve tracked where everyone was throughout the heist .
black denotes fbi agents .
caffrey &apos;s green .
not a lot of green on there .
no , there &apos;s not .
neal and i entered at the same spot here .
i went one way , and then neal ...
disappears into thin air .
agents went all sorts of different directions ,
and every agent shows up on the video except neal .
i don &apos;t get it . why would he do it ?
abigail i.d. &apos; d him at the museum .
the only thing i can think of is
that they &apos;re working together .
yeah , but what does he get out of it ?
she couldn &apos;t get the pascal because of us .
he couldn &apos;t get the marshals &apos; crime @-@ scene report
because of his anklet .
so you think it &apos;s some kind of exchange .
all that talk about giving something up ,
and he was doing this all along .
i was with neal an hour ago .
you were ? why ?
christie and i broke up .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
yeah , me too .
i confided in him . i took his advice .
and now i look at this ,
and i wonder if he meant a single damn word .
i &apos;m tired of this .
i &apos;ve covered for him . i &apos;ve fought for him .
i almost lost my job because of him .
if neal did this ... he &apos;s got to deliver the piece .
and when he does , we will be there .
he &apos;s got the damn pascal on him .
he really did it .
peter , the team &apos;s ready .
and here comes abigail .
the minute they make the exchange ,
we take them both down .
i &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re a man of your word .
i didn &apos;t really have much choice , did i ?
i gave you a little incentive .
no . you blackmailed me .
blackmail ?
i did you a favor .
you planted evidence .
look , you could have ended up in jail empty @-@ handed .
now we both get what we want .
you &apos;re as good as your reputation .
here &apos;s everything you want from the marshals &apos; database .
i don &apos;t want it .
what ?
peter , what do you want to do ?
we &apos;ve got him delivering the pascal .
let &apos;s see where this goes .
are you serious ?
i said i wouldn &apos;t take the offer .
the price is too high .
fine .
it &apos;s your loss .
let &apos;s move .
hello , neal .
abigail has the pascal on her right now .
oh , yeah ? do you know where she is ?
corner of 53rd and park .
fbi ! you &apos;re under arrest !
that was fast .
drop the bag !
turn around ! put your hands behind your back !
when did you figure it out ?
after you left the office .
you realized i wasn &apos;t on the security footage ?
yep .
blackmail ?
she planted some of my hairs at the marshals &apos; office .
i &apos;m guessing that stroll around their building
wasn &apos;t a solitary one .
she set me up perfectly .
you wouldn &apos;t have believed me .
you should have given me the chance .
am i going in the back of one of those , too ?
we &apos;ll see .
look who &apos;s not wearing cuffs .
the day &apos;s not done yet .
are you gonna interrogate her ?
i don &apos;t have the heart to .
after everything i &apos;ve gone through the last couple of days ...
i kind of like the idea of diana the docent living on ,
at least to someone .
someone going to jail ?
hey , i didn &apos;t say it was a perfect idea .
so , i heard you didn &apos;t take the flash drive .
looks like you finally gave something up .
i got tired of running .
peter &apos;s ready for me .
it may be a while before i get the chance to run again .
good luck , caffrey .
thanks .
you were put in a difficult situation .
i understand that .
but you made the wrong decision .
i caused enough trouble in your life lately .
i thought ...
well , i thought i could protect you from it this time .
lying to me is never protecting me .
what about the marshals ?
i spoke with them .
they are not happy that someone broke into one of
their most secure buildings .
did they find my dna ?
they did .
but they &apos;re not pressing charges against you ...
in exchange for my keeping the news about the break @-@ in quiet .
no egg on their face ...
no jail time for me .
thank you .
this isn &apos;t a favor . you didn &apos;t commit that crime .
and the crime you did commit
led to the arrest of a thief and the safe return of an item .
even so , if you hadn &apos;t called me
the second after you walked away from her ...
i would be in jail right now ,
and i wouldn &apos;t blame you for putting me there .
i gave the drive back to the marshals .
good .
really ?
look , i said the price was too high , and i meant it .
your trust is too important to me .
in case it &apos;s needed against abigail ,
i made a copy of the file .
due diligence and all .
peter ...
if you find any information that leads to sam ...
i will tell you .
i will tell you .
thank you .
wow , honey , first case back --
already closed .
not bad , agent burke .
well , not the cleanest win , but i &apos;ll take the victory .
well , at least neal didn &apos;t shoot anyone .
there is that .
you have your bad @-@ news face on .
does everyone know i have this face ?
neal told me my trust was more important to him
than the flash drive .
and i believed him .
i don &apos;t know where the -- where the face comes in .
i &apos;m not sure i should .
what do you mean ?
he called the fbi the minute abigail walked away .
he knew we &apos;d arrest her ... with both items .
and he knew that once you had abigail ,
the flash drive would go to the evidence room ...
where i would have access to it .
do you think this was one long con ?
honestly , i don &apos;t know .
but if there &apos;s anyone who can find a way
to get everything he wants ,
it &apos;s neal .
