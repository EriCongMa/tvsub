zach , seriously .
why aren &apos;t you serious with me ?
i am .
it &apos;s really not that far away .
yeah , well , college changes people .
you sound so old .
you &apos;re going to be going to college , too .
yeah , well , not till next year .
then we &apos;ll both change .
mom &apos;s home !
yes , mom &apos;s home .
put your clothes on .
hey , mom .
mrs. florrick , how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
how are we doing in here ?
we &apos;re just watching the results .
dad hasn &apos;t won yet .
uh , they say they won &apos;t have the results in till tomorrow .
yeah , but he &apos;s ahead .
maddie &apos;s down by five percent .
and kresteva ?
he won the republican primary ,
so dad knows who he &apos;s got to beat , anyway .
uh , mrs. florrick , my parents
want zach to come over tomorrow night for dinner .
is that all right ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s fine .
just have your parents call me .
mom , there &apos;s someone on the phone for you .
janie ludwig .
you should be studying in the same room .
janie , hi .
everything okay ?
what ?
alicia .
janie , how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m not good , actually .
i don &apos;t know why i just said that .
the insurance lawyer is here .
he made me so angry i had to step outside .
janie , you don &apos;t need to be here . go home .
roger always said my best quality was my toughness ,
and i &apos;m not going to let him down , not now .
okay .
mr. hobson ?
i love you , too , dear .
no , this shouldn &apos;t take long .
the other side doesn &apos;t have a leg to stand on .
see you in about two hours .
hello , wilk hobson .
i &apos;m so sorry about your client &apos;s loss .
yes , but not sorry enough to pay out
her life insurance policy .
my client , wolf &amp; bland , has some questions
about the untimely death .
justice ludwig died in a car accident .
i &apos;m not sure how much more
&quot; accidental &quot; it gets .
justice ludwig was talking
on his cell phone while driving
and his car wasn &apos;t bluetooth enabled .
which isn &apos;t required in illinois .
it speaks to recklessness .
which is specifically excluded from his policy .
which might be relevant ,
had he been hang gliding .
wolf &amp; bland believes the coroner &apos;s inquest
will find in our favor ,
but we &apos;re willing to pay ten percent
to avoid the uncertainty .
$ 200,000 , how &apos;s that sound ?
on a $ 2 million policy ?
no , thanks .
ha @-@ ha , more than usual .
yeah , most people have trouble finding us
down here in the basement .
i &apos;m , uh , sorry for the cold in here .
that &apos;s the way we ride in the coroner &apos;s office .
this is an inquest as to the cause of the death
of illinois supreme court justice
roger ludwig .
case file 591 @-@ r.
six jurors have been seated from the regular jury pool .
welcome .
i want to stress that this
is not a regular trial .
now , an inquest is merely a fact @-@ finding proceeding
to answer the question :
what is the cause and the manner of death ?
so , uh , i will call our first witness .
the immediate cause of death :
bleeding and trauma ,
due to massive internal injuries .
can you tell us what , if any , substances
you found in the decedent &apos;s system ?
the toxicology report was positive for cytrophynal
as well as alcohol .
that &apos;s a lie .
i know , we &apos;ll address it .
and did you test for blood alcohol ?
yes , it was .06 .
thank you , ms. patel .
excuse me , mr. coroner ,
may i ask a question ?
you ... who are you ?
alicia florrick , mr. coroner .
i represent the wife of the deceased .
ah , yes , the wife of the state &apos;s attorney
in the one county that &apos;s seen fit to do away
with the office of the coroner altogether .
please , probe away .
thank you .
ms. patel , .06 bac is below
the legal intoxication limit , isn &apos;t it ?
it is .
.06 would be consistent with the judge , having say ,
two glasses of wine , with dinner ,
an hour before the accident ?
based on his weight of 192 pounds ,
i suppose that &apos;s about right .
and the cytrophynal , a medication
used to treat insomnia .
could there not be residual traces of it
from the night before ?
yes , uh , cytrophynal can
linger in the system for several days .
so , therefore , could justice ...
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am ,
you &apos;ve asked your three questions .
i ...
i &apos;m sorry ?
you &apos;ve asked your three questions .
attorneys in an inquest are permitted
to ask questions , but only a total of three .
really ?
sorry .
what if i &apos;m fast ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll have to ask you to take your seat .
uh , mr. claypool ,
i &apos;m wilk hobson ,
counsel for wolf &amp; bland insurance .
unlike mrs. florrick ,
i have just one question , if that &apos;s okay .
yes , certainly . please .
ms. patel , in your opinion ,
can the amount of alcohol that results
in a .06 bac still be enough
to impair someone &apos;s judgment ...
objection , goes beyond the scope .
whoa , whoa , whoa , mrs. florrick ,
as i said before , this is not a regular trial .
there are no objections here .
will gardner , please .
are you sure ?
no .
well , i &apos;m just as unfamiliar as alic ...
okay , i &apos;ll see you then .
what was that ?
janie ludwig .
her husband &apos;s inquest .
oh , yes ,
that car crash .
it was horrible .
how is she ?
upset .
she wants me to help alicia at the inquest .
well , that sounds right . what &apos;s the problem ?
nothing . what &apos;s up ?
an invitation to the chicago shamrock dinner .
we &apos;ve been asked to buy a table .
they &apos;ve never invited us before .
i know , we &apos;re moving up in the world .
and with alicia &apos;s husband there ,
it might be a slap in the face if we say no .
peter didn &apos;t win yet , did he ?
the last i heard , it was neck and neck between him and maddie .
i &apos;ll wait to see if he wins before buying a table .
cary .
yes , you needed me ?
congratulations . what fantastic news .
talk about landing the big fish , good job .
i ...
we weren &apos;t even trying for
emmonds pharmaceuticals .
we thought they were deep into canning &apos;s pocket .
how &apos;d you do it ?
well , i &apos;m just one part of a team .
that &apos;s not what i heard .
their chief counsel said it was all because of you .
this is a good way
to stay on the equity partner track , cary .
$ 5 million a year in litigation costs ?
pretty impressive .
that &apos;s their spokesman now .
he &apos;s in your office , cary .
he wants to say hello .
okay .
emmonds pharmaceuticals .
yes , good job .
hello .
dad ?
cary .
sir , hi .
this is a surprise .
i hope so .
and this is a very cool office .
you have a view , two desks ,
you &apos;re on the same floor as the partners .
i &apos;m impressed .
yeah , thanks , dad . so , what &apos;s going on ?
well , i &apos;m back in chicago .
yeah .
sorry about that press secretary job .
no , no , no , look .
that was inappropriate of me
to even ask for that favor .
and i realized that the job wasn &apos;t quite
the right fit for me anyway .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m lobbying .
for emmonds pharmaceuticals now .
and we were looking for a firm to help us draft
a medical marijuana statute
to take to the general assembly , and i ...
thought of you .
you thought of me ?
ha , don &apos;t sound so surprised .
of course i thought of you .
you &apos;re good .
your firm is hot right now .
a pharmaceutical company wants to get
a medical marijuana law passed ?
well , right now , there is a competing
initiative being written .
we want ours to take a different approach .
there &apos;s a medical marijuana initiative
being written and emmonds is concerned
if it succeeds , it &apos;ll cut into their profits ,
so they want to draft a competing initiative
to confuse the voters ?
come on , let &apos;s not put it like that .
we @-@ we want a more sensible initiative .
how &apos;s that sound ?
sensible .
good .
i thought that you could draft the initiative
and then represent us through the legislative process .
what ?
i just ...
i didn &apos;t think you were going to talk to me again .
cary .
you &apos;re my only son .
i &apos;m never not going to talk to you .
we are now confident reporting the projected
彼得 · 福瑞克
democratic primary winner for illinois governor
is going to be state &apos;s attorney peter florrick .
congratulations , sir .
i said @-@ said congratulations , sir .
now we turn to kresteva .
i said now we turn to kresteva !
sir , i wanted to talk to you about jordan .
i don &apos;t think we need him .
are you sure ?
because i think we &apos;re losing our singularity of purpose .
yeah .
no , i understand .
okay , okay .
good job , eli .
well done .
oh , come on , let &apos;s hug .
now comes the real battle .
now it comes .
on that note , i need to show you something .
zach florrick has a girlfriend .
her name is nisa dalmar .
i know , she &apos;s black .
it &apos;s all fine .
no , that &apos;s not it .
did you see this photo that she tweeted today ?
it &apos;s a milad @-@ un @-@ nabi festival .
it &apos;s a celebration of the prophet &apos;s birth .
i did a deeper check into nisa &apos;s father .
he donated to the hamas charity organization ,
mouharib mousalim .
when ?
his last donation was in 2008 .
and mouharib mousalim was just put on the treasury &apos;s list
for terrorist affiliations this past october .
what ?
we should do something about it .
as you can see , the skid marks on the road
reveal a course correction .
uh , using the formula for minimum skid speed
we determined he was driving roughly
55 miles per hour ,
which is ten miles over the speed limit .
speeding equals reckless driving .
uh , mr. gardner .
time for the main event .
i &apos;m not here to replace you .
mrs. ludwig just asked
me to assist , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s okay .
we , uh , recovered justice ludwig &apos;s cell phone ,
which he was using at the time of the crash .
um , that may also have contributed to the accident .
anything from the gallery ?
yes , sir , if i may .
and you are ?
will gardner .
i &apos;m also on mrs. ludwig &apos;s legal team .
you only get three questions .
you can only ask three questions .
she has a legal team now .
this is getting serious .
proceed .
i , uh ...
although there was no bluetooth
in justice ludwig &apos;s car , his phone had a speaker function
making it possible for him to ...
make a call and not hold his cell phone while driving ...
isn &apos;t that right ?
yes , but we have no way of knowing
if he was actually holding it or not .
okay , but rather than ...
the use of a phone or the speed he was traveling ,
couldn &apos;t the presence of black ice on the road
have forced justice ludwig
to make the course correction , sending him into the guardrail ,
which by its mere presence
implies this is a very sharp curve in the road ?
objection . mr. gardner is combining several questions ...
as i &apos;ve said ,
mr. hobson , there are no objections here .
officer ?
taking the points one at a time ,
uh , guardrails are placed by the department of transportation
for various reasons , sir .
and , yes , i observed black ice on the road that night ,
but with those road conditions ,
the victim should have been
driving under the speed limit .
excuse me .
mr. coroner , i would like to reserve our third question .
objec ... uh , point of ... clarification .
uh , can he do that ?
i don &apos;t see why not .
now , officer , let &apos;s talk some more about this black ice .
hello ?
oh , yeah , this is robyn , mrs. florrick ,
the other investigator you hired .
oh , hi . how are you ?
good , good .
cold . uh , i saw kalinda &apos;s phone ringing
and i picked it up .
do you want me to ask her something ?
yes .
ask her , is there anything that can point to an accident
and not recklessness ?
we &apos;re questioning the officer right now .
hold on , mrs. florrick .
thanks .
look , can i call you back ?
yeah , i know . i saw that .
it &apos;s weird , huh ?
... which is why
we concluded that , uh , black ice was not a likely cause .
very well .
thank you , officer .
mr. claypool , may i ask a question ?
mr. gardner has already asked all the questions
for mrs. ludwig &apos;s legal team , mr. coroner .
no , not all . we have one left .
that is correct .
ask your question , mrs. florrick .
officer rivera ...
has the county been replacing
the dimmer , orange incandescent streetlights on that road
with the brighter l.e.d. lights ,
which would mean that the night of the accident ,
in the hundred yards preceding the bend
in the road , the judge
entered a darker stretch that doesn &apos;t show
the black ice as well ,
resulting in the judge having
to make a last @-@ second course correction ?
yes .
thank you .
looks like an accident to me .
mr. hobson , any questions ?
officer rivera , upon looking into the cell phone records ,
did you determine the call the judge was making
at the time of the accident ?
yes , he &apos;d called his voice mail .
and from whom did he receive voice mail messages that night ?
there was only one .
it was from the illinois attorney general &apos;s office .
uh , their anti @-@ corruption unit .
last question then . to your knowledge ,
what does this anti @-@ corruption unit investigate ?
uh , public officials
for , uh , corruption and ethics violations .
mr. coroner , i &apos;m aware that only you can
introduce evidence , but it is our belief that the deceased
ran his car off the road in
an attempt to commit suicide .
oh , come on .
he can &apos;t just spin a story
in front of the jury .
mr. gardner ,
please . what evidence ?
evidence regarding the judge &apos;s last weeks ,
when he discovered that he was being investigated for bribery .
this is outrageous , mr. coroner .
mr. hobson is trying to void a life insurance policy--
that &apos;s the only reason he &apos;s arguing for suicide .
not at all .
like mrs. ludwig &apos;s abundant legal team ,
i &apos;m just trying to get to the truth here .
okay .
whether it is or is not outrageous , i will decide .
please have your evidence
ready tomorrow , and i will review .
what &apos;d i do ?
nothing . we thought we would just talk .
you &apos;ve been doing great work with i.t. , zach .
we are really thrilled .
okay .
so , you and your girlfriend ,
y @-@ you &apos;re pretty serious , right ?
yeah .
this is about nisa ?
no . well ...
a little .
i remember my first girlfriend in high school .
she meant everything to me .
nisa &apos;s not my first girlfriend .
oh . well ...
that &apos;s good to know .
do you mind if , uh , i show you a tweet
that your girlfriend sent out ?
uh , wh @-@ what tweet ?
yeah .
okay .
what , right now ? okay , okay .
they need me to change something in the stump .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re trying to break them up .
do you see me doing anything ?
see , the thing is ,
zach , that ... you have to start thinking
about all your relationships in relation to the campaign .
&apos;cause there is already a spotlight on your mom and dad .
see if they &apos;re done .
i &apos;m not seeing if they &apos;re done .
nora , i am the boss . you are the ...
oh , zach ,
is everything all right ? what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;m fine .
what is it ? what &apos;d he say ?
mrs. florrick .
mr. agos , i heard we were representing you now .
yes , well , i figured , anything i could do to help cary , why not ?
you know , i saw your name listed with the partners .
aren &apos;t you the same year as cary ?
well , we came in together , but then cary left
and came back again , and we &apos;re thrilled to have him .
so he &apos;s not on the partner track ?
no , no . i &apos;m , um ... yes .
he definitely will be . soon .
dad .
hi , son . i got sidetracked with alicia .
you know , it &apos;s fantastic how quickly she made partner .
and if that doesn &apos;t light a fire under you ,
i don &apos;t know what will .
christie yeargin . i &apos;ve been an investigator
at the illinois attorney general &apos;s office for six years .
apologies for the temperature in here , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;ve asked for some space heaters in here .
now , you were in charge
of the investigation into justice roger ludwig ?
yes .
ms. yeargin , what was the basis
for the investigation into justice ludwig ?
we had him pegged as a bribery target .
i see . did this have anything to do with his participation
in a wednesday night basketball game with mr. gardner over here ?
yes and no .
we started looking into the deceased
because of the basketball games , but ...
we continued our investigation
because of justice ludwig &apos;s financial troubles .
he and his wife were a little overextended on their mortgage .
you have only one more question , mr. hobson .
yes . thank you .
ms. yeargin , during your investigation of justice ludwig ,
would you say that the combination of this attention ,
along with his obviously precarious finances ,
was making him depressed-- depressed enough , in fact ,
to do something desperate , something like suicide ?
well , he wasn &apos;t happy about it .
but beyond that , i couldn &apos;t say .
nice speech , mr. hobson .
way to hit the suicide theme .
ms. yeargin , how many judges
does the attorney general &apos;s office investigate every year ?
depends on the year .
oh , we &apos;re always looking for potential corruption targets .
and how many of these investigations actually bear ...
strike that . how many times does your investigation
actually lead to charges being filed against the judge ?
thankfully , not very often .
and in this case ,
you didn &apos;t have any solid evidence
that justice ludwig had actually accepted a bribe , did you ?
not yet , but we were working on it .
and did you feel that ...
thank you . nothing further .
uh ... you &apos;re sure you don &apos;t want to wait for kalinda ?
no , we have to get back to ...
the morgue .
it &apos;s okay , robyn .
we just need a rundown on the facts .
okay , um ...
well , the ludwigs , they @-@ they did have financial problems .
and as far as we can tell , mr. ludwig-- justice ludwig--
kept them from his wife-- the money troubles .
and the bribery investigation is based on a lawyer
who was accused of bribing judges .
it &apos;s okay . we don &apos;t need to go into that .
okay . um ,
the justice &apos;s last day :
he had dinner that night at 8 p.m. with a friend ,
jared bigelow , a lobbyist .
and ... oh , we were able to download the judge &apos;s i @-@ pass .
使用的电子自动收费系统
do you know what that is ?
from the tri @-@ state tollway ?
yes , we do .
well , the last record we could find
is that he exited the tollway at 10 : 37 p.m. ,
but what &apos;s strange is the accident was at 11 : 42 .
and why is that strange ?
it took him an hour to travel four miles .
you checked where he might &apos;ve stopped ?
there are only two options at that exit :
a gas station and a motel .
let &apos;s not update mrs. ludwig on this until we know for sure .
but keep up the good work .
the application fee for a marijuana dispensary
increases from $ 2,000 to $ 5,000 . that &apos;s good .
the license fee ought to increase as well though , don &apos;t you think ?
i didn &apos;t want to get greedy .
it &apos;s good for the state budget .
well ... i think ...
it might start to seem obvious
that the initiative isn &apos;t exactly genuine .
dispensary locations to be at least 300 yards away
from the nearest school . we should change that to 500 .
we &apos;re the third @-@ largest school district in the country .
if you make it 500 ...
it makes it more difficult to find a location for a shop .
it makes it transparent that the law isn &apos;t about medical marijuana .
it &apos;s about protecting your market .
do we have some problem here ?
i don &apos;t think so .
maybe we should ask a partner to sit in ,
help supervise .
sure .
if that &apos;s what you want .
would you two like a room ?
uh , no .
i just would like to ask you some questions .
am i in some kind of trouble ?
i don &apos;t think so .
were you working here on the night of march 2 ?
um , i work every night except tuesday and sunday , s @-@ so ...
so , that &apos;s a yes .
do you remember
if you saw this man that night ?
i &apos;m not supposed to give information out about our guests
unless it &apos;s to the police .
are you the police ?
no .
sure .
he was here . he had a room , paid cash .
was he with anyone ?
he checked in alone , but ...
when he left , he was with a woman .
a blonde woman .
they were arguing .
did you hear what they were yelling ?
no . he got into his car ,
she got into her suv .
they both left .
do you remember anything about the suv ?
it was nighttime .
all i could see was that it was a dark four @-@ door , i think ...
oh , it had ... it had one of those license plates .
which license plate ?
the specialty ones .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t see the number , but it had a bird on it .
okay .
thanks .
it &apos;s hard to work with a relative , isn &apos;t it ?
not really .
why ?
your dad . it must be difficult .
when personal feelings enter into legal work ,
it makes everything a big emotional stew .
did i do something ?
no , no .
i just think , um ...
we want to give the emmonds team everything they want .
defer to them .
it &apos;s a good client to keep happy .
did my dad talk to you ?
that &apos;s not important , cary .
i should keep closer tabs on this , anyway .
what did he say ?
nothing .
cary ... everything &apos;s fine .
i &apos;d just like to sit in on the next meeting .
if you don &apos;t mind .
no . i don &apos;t .
that would be good .
great . keep up the good work .
last saturday night ?
yeah . gas station on route 2,
down the road from the motel .
the attendant said he couldn &apos;t see the road
because your tanker was blocking his view .
so who are you two , cagney and lacey ?
uh , there was a crash a few minutes later .
we &apos;re just trying to find out if anyone saw anything .
sure , i saw something . what do i get for telling you ?
a clear conscience that you did the right thing .
yeah . what else ?
i didn &apos;t see the crash , but i saw the cars .
uh , cars ?
there was more than one ?
yes .
there was a sedan in front and a black suv behind it .
and it came up fast , honking the horn ,
lights flashing-- it was totally out of control .
uh , the black suv ?
yes .
and i &apos;m sorry
for the way i talked to you before .
that &apos;s okay .
who &apos;s the woman ?
we &apos;re not sure . all we know is that she &apos;s blonde ,
probably in her 40s and that she was arguing with ludwig .
sounds like a jilted mistress .
well , we can &apos;t say definitively .
they had an argument .
maybe he broke it off , she wasn &apos;t happy .
she chases after him , drives him off the road .
do you believe that ?
it &apos;s not what i believe ,
it &apos;s what the coroner believes .
he &apos;s already intrigued by suicide--
let &apos;s see if we can intrigue him with murder .
kalinda , you line up this motel clerk as a witness ,
and we &apos;ll look for some precedent
for admitting it in an inquest .
okay . good .
what did you tell that guy ?
come on .
tell me .
* while the people sleep , i lie awake *
* encased in dreams *
* that carry me *
* to a distant sound *
* to undertake *
* i feel its way *
* even though i *
* am helpless of *
* the force ... *
what did you find ?
aml v. hellman .
yes . that &apos;s what i have .
you do not .
you &apos;re right . what is it ?
lawsuit over a biased inquest--
insufficient evidence .
it &apos;ll make the coroner so afraid of a lawsuit ,
he won &apos;t dare pass on murder evidence .
good . you argue it .
okay .
will peter have a problem
if i go to the chicago shamrock dinner ?
will he have a ... problem with it ?
no . are you going ?
we got a table .
are you ?
uh , yes .
okay .
i don &apos;t want to be wary of you , alicia .
i know .
i don &apos;t like it .
feels like we &apos;re avoiding each other .
i know . i liked it when we were friends .
me , too .
then let &apos;s do that .
okay .
okay . good night .
nisa , i didn &apos;t know you were here .
i &apos;m leaving .
nisa ...
is something wrong ?
um , nothing .
i @-@ i &apos;m just , um ... nothing .
good night , mrs. florrick .
hey , mom .
grace , do you know what &apos;s wrong with nisa ?
oh , yeah . zach broke up with her .
hey ... wait , i thought they were doing good .
yeah , well , the campaign told zach to cool it .
the campaign ?
yeah , the whole picture thing .
okay , grace , talk to me as if i weren &apos;t omniscient .
there &apos;s a picture with zach and nisa
and it &apos;s with her muslim parents ,
and it looked like it might hurt dad .
according to who ? eli ?
mm @-@ mm , jordan .
he sat down with zach ,
and then zach broke up with nisa .
why does everyone think it &apos;s all right to parent my children ?
alicia !
not now , eli .
how dare you counsel my son on his personal life
without my permission .
mrs. florrick , i don &apos;t think that you ...
why don &apos;t we talk in here .
no .
if this is about the muslim photo ,
zach asked if the photo was affecting the campaign ,
and i told him the truth .
i said we &apos;re taking the hit . that &apos;s it .
i didn &apos;t tell him what to do .
he &apos;s 17 years old , and adores his father--
what did you think he would do ?
mrs. florrick , with all due respect ,
it was only a matter of time before this became
a serious problem for your husband .
that is not the issue !
you stepped way over the line .
don &apos;t you ever approach my son again .
ever .
alicia .
i am so sorry . i warned him about the family issues ,
but i think his other campaigns ran differently .
okay , eli .
i don &apos;t know what the game is here ,
but if you &apos;re using me , stop .
okay ?
okay .
why don &apos;t you give it a rest , mr. hobson .
obfuscation . you &apos;re the one that brought up suicide .
wait , wait , wait ...
one at a time .
mr. hobson .
mr. gardner is advocating this witness
to push the ridiculous theory that justice ludwig was murdered .
aml v. hellman , mr. coroner .
the coroner in hellman was found biased
because he only entertained one proposition of a case .
fairness demands
that a jury not only hear evidence as to suicide ...
there is simply no foundation ...
a moment , mr. hobson .
danny , you can bring in the jury .
we &apos;ll hear from your witness ,
mr. gardner , mrs. florrick .
i better go prepare her .
yes , good luck with that .
oh , god .
i &apos;m sorry .
janie , i hate to ask you this ,
but do you have any idea who this blonde woman might be ?
what , the one that my husband was screwing in a motel room ? no !
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve lost him
and now his love all in one week .
i don &apos;t know what i have left .
his debts , i suppose .
is everything all right ?
well , your father has some
unfortunate news about the emmonds pharmaceutical account .
i was just telling diane that i owe your firm an apology ...
but a decision has been made to go with jennings / albright .
you &apos;re pulling your business ?
management has expressed concerns about lockhart / gardner &apos;s history
of pursuing big pharma with class actions .
i have assured mr. agos
that our past work won &apos;t impede
our total commitment in this matter .
of course not . there &apos;s no conflict here .
that &apos;s the very point i made to the board , but the ceo thinks
that the optics are wrong .
this is my mistake .
i should &apos;ve prepared them .
is there any way for us to resolve this ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
and i &apos;m very sorry .
diane , this is ... this is a complete surprise .
yes .
for me , too .
okay .
who &apos;s she ?
no idea .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
as you know , we are now considering
not only a theory of accidental death
as well as a theory of suicide ,
but also a theory , potentially , of homicide .
which is why ...
assistant state &apos;s attorney of lake county shirley mann
has joined us for the duration .
thank you , mr. claypool .
at this time , if possible ,
i &apos;d like to ask a few questions of mrs. ludwig .
mr. claypool , i &apos;m not sure
how my client &apos;s testimony is relevant in this regard .
i &apos;m not , either .
but the asa has an absolute right
to join in these proceedings .
mrs. ludwig , please .
make your answers short and declarative .
thank you , mrs. ludwig .
i am very sorry for your loss , and i apologize
for having to question you at this time .
now , according to the statement you gave the police ,
you were home the night of march 2 , is that correct ?
yes . i hadn &apos;t wanted to go
to the dinner my husband was attending .
i didn &apos;t feel well .
and you were at home until you were notified
of your husband &apos;s death at approximately 12 : 20 a.m. ?
yes .
now , as coroner claypool has explained ,
this is not a courtroom ,
but you are still under oath .
do you wish to stand by that statement ?
mr. claypool , i &apos;m advising my client to
invoke her fifth amendment right not to testify .
all ... all right , everyone .
mrs. ludwig ?
on counsel &apos;s advice ,
i am invoking my fifth amendment right not to answer .
mrs. ludwig ,
this is an affidavit from your neighbor stating that he heard you
leave on the night in question , shortly before 10 : 00 p.m. ,
and that according to him ,
you didn &apos;t return until almost midnight .
mrs. ludwig , where did you go
between 10 : 00 p.m. and midnight , march 2 ?
on counsel &apos;s advice ,
i am invoking my fifth amendment right
not to answer .
so , you did know about the affair ?
i suspected .
i wasn &apos;t sure .
did you lie to the police about your whereabouts
at the time of your husband &apos;s death ?
yes .
when he mentioned the dinner ,
i got suspicious .
i thought about calling bigelow ,
but i knew i wouldn &apos;t get a straight answer out of him .
he and roger were very close ,
and he had covered for roger before .
this wasn &apos;t the first time your husband had been unfaithful ?
where did you go that night , mrs. ludwig ?
i drove to the restaurant .
when i saw he wasn &apos;t there ,
i drove around to a couple of places i thought he might be .
then i just drove around angry for a while , and then , i went home .
then the phone rang , and everything changed .
i know i should have told you .
i just didn &apos;t think that it was important ,
and i was embarrassed .
did i just lose this ?
it &apos;s not about losing the insurance money anymore .
you &apos;re in danger of being arrested .
diane .
good to see you .
mr. agos , i wasn &apos;t expecting you .
we received the call from your general counsel .
yes , about that .
now , look , i may have overstepped a bit
in trying to help out my son , and if so , mea culpa .
parents are blind when it comes to their children .
indeed .
what i &apos;m saying is ,
i think there may be a way for us to salvage this .
if we could get a few more partners on the account
so that our gc doesn &apos;t feel like
we &apos;re in the hands of a fourth @-@ year associate .
diane ?
i &apos;d like you to meet dale dazzo ,
the ceo of emmonds pharmaceuticals .
well , it &apos;s a pleasure .
cary happened to catch me at lunch .
he &apos;s been telling me about your firm &apos;s lobbying work .
and your connection to the sa &apos;s office .
very impressive .
there was some nervousness
from one of our vps ,
but i think we &apos;d be fools to go anywhere else .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
well , we &apos;re happy to hear that .
dale , dad , welcome to lockhart / gardner .
again .
no , i am impressed , cary .
i mean , that was a remarkable save .
and you &apos;re good with dazzo .
that is not easy .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
he said that you &apos;re doing pretty good , too .
you know , we could always work together .
unfortunately , mr. dazzo thought it would be better
if i worked directly with the general counsel .
without any middlemen .
you understand ?
he didn &apos;t say that .
he did .
you hold a grudge , don &apos;t you ?
no .
dad , no , i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m too busy to hold grudges .
take care .
thanks for the business .
janie ludwig said you and her husband
were good friends .
we were .
bethany and i were devastated when we heard the news .
did he bring anyone to dinner with him that evening ?
no , janie didn &apos;t come .
it was just us catching up .
we meant , anyone
besides mrs. ludwig .
no .
no , no , no , no . no .
janie and roger had some rough spots ,
but that was a ... a long time ago .
there was a colleague he was seeing about a year ago ,
but we sat him down , and he broke it off .
he &apos;s been a faithful man ever since .
this colleague a year ago-- was she blonde ?
no . why ?
hey , babe . everything all right ?
just some , uh , investigators with the ludwigs &apos; attorneys .
they had some questions about roger .
it &apos;s terrible what happened .
they think roger might have been murdered .
oh , my gosh .
what do you think ?
i think that &apos;s a very unique license plate .
what do you want to do ?
what ?
you were sleeping with justice ludwig ,
and you fought with him the night he was murdered .
go away .
ok , well , if you won &apos;t talk with us ,
we can always talk to your husband .
yes , roger and i were seeing each other ,
but i had nothing to do with his death .
we fought at the motel because i was breaking up with him .
after that , i drove straight home .
right , and can anyone confirm that ?
my husband .
but it will destroy my marriage . please .
we know there was another vehicle involved .
did you see anyone else that night ?
as i was driving the other way ,
i passed an suv speeding , swerving .
it was headed in the same direction as roger .
and you didn &apos;t report it ?
i couldn &apos;t .
janie is a friend of mine .
he was driven off the road ?
yes , by a drunk driver
with .10 blood alcohol .
so , a new , new , new theory .
i move that we skip the preliminaries
and just get to the man on the grassy knoll .
yeah , before we get to that , mr. hobson ,
i need to hear this one out .
his name is landon boyce .
20 minutes after justice ludwig crashed his car ,
landon boyce was pulled over
for a dui on the same road .
and yet the police haven &apos;t said boo about any of this ?
the lake county police never mentioned this dui
because they didn &apos;t know about it .
the arrest happened two miles into cook county .
the only thing this proves is that some guy on the same
stretch of highway got hit with a dui .
there &apos;s nothing to suggest he drove the judge off the road .
mr. claypool , we &apos;d like to submit
the edr from mr. boyce &apos;s suv .
e.d ... ?
event data recorder .
it &apos;s like the little black box for a car .
11 : 42 p.m. ,
the exact moment of the judge &apos;s accident ,
the edr shows mr. boyce &apos;s suv
swerved and braked hard ,
coming to a full stop before accelerating again .
justice ludwig swerved to avoid being hit and
crashed into the guardrail .
well ,
mr. hobson ,
of all the theories i &apos;ve heard from both sides ,
this is the first one
that &apos;s had something resembling hard evidence .
i &apos;m gonna let the jury hear it .
两百万美元
i never expected them to settle .
certainly not for the full amount .
wilk hobson couldn &apos;t risk it going to a jury .
if they &apos;d ruled it was an accident ,
wolf &amp; bland would have had to pay double .
we &apos;re just sorry about everything
that was laid out on the table .
there &apos;s no need to be sorry about the truth .
a victory all around .
yup .
i &apos;ll see you at the chicago shamrock dinner ?
yes .
you do know it &apos;s white tie , right ?
what ?
what &apos;s going on here ?
i &apos;m going .
you &apos;re going ? where are you going ?
come on . you set me up , and i didn &apos;t even see it coming .
nicely played .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
peter relieved me .
got involved in the family business ,
so he asked me to take a step back .
gosh . that &apos;s terrible .
and all i wanted to do was help him win , eli .
yeah . that &apos;s all you wanted to do .
some people aren &apos;t like you .
we &apos;re too busy dealing with politics in the field
to want politics in the office .
hold on , let me write that down .
good luck , eli .
you &apos;re gonna die a sad and lonely old man
&apos;cause you don &apos;t trust anyone .
the florrick campaign thanks you for your contribution . good @-@ bye .
you look like a princess .
this was marked down 60 % , so , thank you .
nice , mom .
grandma veronica called .
she said she &apos;s stopping by
before she goes to her st. patrick &apos;s day party .
ooh , that should be fun .
you want us to hide the alcohol ?
it &apos;s st. patrick &apos;s day in chicago .
hiding it won &apos;t make a difference .
have fun tonight .
love you .
love you , too .
what happened with nisa ?
oh , it &apos;s okay , mom .
no . zach , the campaign , these campaigns--
they ...
you date whoever you want .
it really is okay , mom .
i was going to break up with her anyways .
no , zach , the campaign will survive .
seriously , i @-@ i was going to break up with her .
college is right around the corner ,
and she wanted to get more serious .
go to your party . i &apos;m fine .
* my dewy @-@ eyed disney bride , what has tried *
