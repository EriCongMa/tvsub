morning , roomie .
hey !
you remembered to put clothes on this morning .
fifth day &apos;s a charm .
it &apos;s so great to be back here . you &apos;re making it so easy on me and emma .
it &apos;s great having you back . stay as long as you want .
and when does she stop crying all night ?
hey ! you &apos;re not naked .
rach , when will we expect to see you tonight ?
probably around 6 . but she &apos;s in the bedroom , all ready to go .
but she fell back to sleep , so ..
she &apos;s probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .
bye .
bye .
hey , i hope emma isn &apos;t making it too hard on you .
no , hey , it &apos;s been great .
i just want you to know that with rachel staying here ..
all my feelings from before are totally over .
and even if they weren &apos;t ..
when you walk in on a woman using a breast pump ..
yeah , that &apos;ll do it .
wow !
so how are you ?
i &apos;m okay .
really ?
sure . i mean , do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out ?
of course . you know , i &apos;m disappointed , but it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a divorce .
well , actually it ..
it &apos;s not a divorce . it is not a divorce !
anyway , i think rachel and i need to get on with our lives .
maybe start seeing other people .
wow . really ?
sure , why not ? in fact , if you know anyone that &apos;d be good for me .. ?
sure . i know lots of girls .
any names come to mind ?
names ?
the.one.with.the.blind.dates
i was about to eat . want something ?
what you got ?
okay , let &apos;s see , we got strained peas , strained carrots ..
strained plums . we haven &apos;t tried that yet !
goody !
thanks .
so how is it living with rachel again ?
i mean , apart from the great food ?
i &apos;m fine , i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just ..
it &apos;s just weird what &apos;s happening with her and ross .
yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody .
rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too .
why are they doing this ?
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re so perfect for each other . it &apos;s crazy .
you know what &apos;s crazy ? these jars.what is there , like , two bites in here ?
i just wish they &apos;d realize they should be together .
when they moved in together ,
i figured that &apos;s where things were headed .
they should be a family .
they should marry and have more children .
yes . and they should name one of their kids joey .
i may not have kids .
someone &apos;s gotta carry on the family name .
you know what ? maybe once they start dating and see what &apos;s out there ..
they &apos;ll realize how good they are for each other .
yeah , because it is slim pickings .
i had this date last night . yuck !
but we should probably keep it down , she &apos;s still in the bedroom .
so , what are we gonna do ? are we just gonna set them up with people ?
i know , that just pushes them further and further apart .
i know what we can do . we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates ..
so they &apos;ll realize how good they are together .
that &apos;s a great plan .
yeah .
you know what the best part of it is ? i get to do my plan laugh .
okay , shh ! not so loud . we don &apos;t want to wake up ..
hi . you guys aren &apos;t doing anything tonight , are you ?
see , now , why would you assume that ? just because we &apos;re married ?
i mean , i will have you know that we are very hip , happening people .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to get back to reading the obituaries .
i was just asking because i need someone to watch emma tonight .
sure we &apos;ll do it . what are you up to ?
well , phoebe set me up on a date .
oh , my god .
why ? what &apos;s the big deal ?
i figured because you and ross are ..
what ? slept together a year and a half ago ? yeah , i &apos;m all set .
i think it &apos;s great you &apos;re going on a date . it sounds healthy .
i mean , you have needs . embrace your womanhood .
you want a job ? turn off oprah and send out a resume .
i &apos;ll bring her by around 7 , okay ?
that &apos;s perfect .
you guys are gonna have so much fun . she &apos;s at such a cute age .
a couple things . now that she eats solid food , she poops around the clock .
and watch out for your hair because she likes to grab it .
she &apos;s also in this phase where if you leave the room , she screams , but ..
thanks , you guys . have fun .
suddenly i wish i was reading my own name .
joey , hey . i &apos;m so excited .
i set rachel up with the worst guy .
all right . who is he ?
it &apos;s a guy i used to massage . by &quot; massage .. &quot;
i mean hold down so he wouldn &apos;t turn over and flash me .
wait till you hear who i got for ross .
oh , yeah .
okay . she &apos;s this really boring woman . she &apos;s a teacher .
a teacher ?
she &apos;s into history and foreign movies .
and she loves puzzles .
come on , who loves puzzles ?
well , ross does .
you &apos;re ruining the plan !
joey , you fixed him up with his perfect woman .
oh , my god , you &apos;re right !
yeah .
she even reads for pleasure !
how do you know a woman like that ?
i &apos;m not allowed to know smart women ?
joey ?
we met at the library . i went in to pee .
so now what do we do ?
well , okay .
i &apos;ll call her and tell her the date &apos;s canceled and find him somebody else .
what if we don &apos;t find him somebody else ? we &apos;ll just tell her the date &apos;s off ..
but we don &apos;t tell ross . he &apos;ll go to the restaurant and get stood up .
i hear that &apos;s bad .
so this is great . rachel &apos;s gonna have a terrible date ..
ross gets stood up , and then they &apos;ll realize how good they have it together .
yes , the plan .
it &apos;s not santa &apos;s plan .
no , it &apos;s ..
yeah , you know , it &apos;s not that fun .
no , i think we killed it .
emma ? emma , look at me !
well , i think i &apos;ll go downstairs for a while .
no , no , no ! it &apos;s okay ! it &apos;s okay ! i didn &apos;t go !
don &apos;t cry , it &apos;s just a bit !
i &apos;m your uncle chandler . funny is all i have !
okay , just so you know , i &apos;m gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th .
so don &apos;t touch yourself for the next 48 hours .
i don &apos;t do that .
i &apos;ll try to stop .
did you say until the 6th ?
yeah .
today is the 6th .
no , it &apos;s not .
yes , it &apos;s also 2003 .
oh , my god . today &apos;s the 6th ?
i may be done ovulating !
i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant .
go take the test , see if we &apos;re okay .
okay .
tough crib .
hey , where are all my ovulation sticks ? there &apos;s only one here .
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times .
i &apos;m not working ! there &apos;s not much to do around here !
sorry . you want a roll with that ?
excuse me .
is there a woman waiting at the bar ?
someone average height , dark hair ? or perhaps doing a puzzle ?
there &apos;s a drunk chinese guy .
well , if i &apos;m still here in an hour , buy him a drink on me .
can i get you another glass of wine ?
i don &apos;t know if i should . i don &apos;t want to be drunk when i ..
go home alone tonight .
got stood up , huh ?
it &apos;s no big deal . it &apos;s just a blind date .
are you worried your date came , saw you and left ?
no !
we &apos;re okay . i &apos;m still ovulating .
oh , good , because as of 4 : 00 this afternoon , i am not .
so let &apos;s do this .
i don &apos;t think i can .
oh , come on .
i know you &apos;re not 18 anymore , but give it a minute .
because of emma .
oh , my god , emma .
oh , sweetie , i forgot you were here .
you &apos;re right , we can &apos;t do this . we can &apos;t leave her alone .
sorry .
unless ..
maybe we do it here .
i mean , how much can she even be aware of at this age ?
she &apos;s aware when we leave a room . she may notice if we start ..
canoodling in it .
canoodling ?
well , i can &apos;t say hump or screw ..
in front of the b @-@ a @-@ b @-@ y.
i don &apos;t know , i guess having sex in front of a baby ..
isn &apos;t so ..
horrifying ? scarring ?
something people go to jail for ?
i guess you &apos;re right .
you guess ?
at that bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast , we didn &apos;t have sex ..
because you thought a deer was staring through the window .
well , what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer ?
wow , everything looks so good .
i think i &apos;m gonna have the chicken .
jon lovitz
i just have to say this .
you &apos;re really beautiful .
wow , that &apos;s very sweet . thank you .
i &apos;m kind of funny @-@ looking .
what ?
look , i mean , come on ..
you &apos;re way out of my league . everybody in here knows it .
i bet that guy over there is probably saying :
&quot; why &apos;s she out with him ? he must be rich . &quot;
well , i &apos;m not .
okay .
well , i guess , then the joke &apos;s on him .
what do you think you want to order ? i &apos;m real excited about that chicken .
i &apos;m not funny , either .
so if you were thinking , &quot; well , he &apos;s not that good @-@ looking ..
but maybe we &apos;ll have some laughs , &quot; that ain &apos;t gonna happen .
well , come on , steve , let &apos;s not rule out nervous laughter .
so , now , i think that we should order ..
and then eat , and then leave .
i have a lot of medical problems .
hey , now , wait a minute , phoebe told me ..
that you owned your own restaurant . that &apos;s impressive .
i lost it to drugs .
i silk @-@ screen t @-@ shirts now .
really ? what &apos;s that like ?
it &apos;s really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money .
that &apos;s right . i have no money , i &apos;m not funny ..
i live in a studio apartment with two other guys .
and i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m infertile .
now , come on . come on , steve .
there must be something that you like about yourself .
i do like my hair .
really ?
hello ?
phoebe , it &apos;s me !
i &apos;m going to hunt you down and kill you .
hey , rach !
this is the worst date ever ! how could you set me up with this creep ?
you know , you are talking about one of my dear , dear friends .
i don &apos;t care . this guy is a nightmare .
all right , so he gets a little crazy when he &apos;s stoned .
he &apos;s not stoned .
did he go out for a cigarette ?
yeah . four times .
my dear , sweet rach .
well , our plan is working . rachel &apos;s having a miserable time ..
and ross is stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone .
pretty soon they &apos;ll be back together .
by the time anyone &apos;s figured out what we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ll be in sunny mexico .
oh , wait , that &apos;s the end of a different plan .
she &apos;s asleep . chandler ?
what are you doing ?
emma was doing it .
she &apos;s asleep .
she &apos;s asleep . that means we can ..
yes . but we have to be fast .
oh , okay , i &apos;ll try .
and you can &apos;t make any noise .
okay , i &apos;ll try .
hello ?
emma ?
hey ! hi !
how are you ? how are you ?
where are your babysitters , huh ?
why is the bedroom door closed ?
you can &apos;t have s @-@ e @-@ x when you &apos;re taking care of a b @-@ a @-@ b @-@ i @-@ e.
i &apos;ve got bad news . the chinese guy left .
if it was meant to be , it &apos;s meant to be .
look , you got stood up . who cares ?
we &apos;re gonna show you a good time . sit and relax .
in fact , let me bring you a crab @-@ cake appetizer on the house .
wow , free crab cakes ? well , that &apos;s nice .
although i was hoping to have sex tonight .
just the crab cakes .
what are you doing ? are you trying to get him to stay ? you can &apos;t do that .
just get out of here , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry , what &apos;s going on ?
okay , the waiters have a little pool going .
we have a bet on how long it &apos;ll take before you give up and go home .
what ? !
you &apos;re making money off my misery ?
well , if you stay till 9 : 20 , i am .
this is unbelievable . i have never been so insulted in my life .
now , if you &apos;ll wrap up my free crab cakes , i &apos;ll be on my way .
well , that was weird . you were loud and i was fast .
i think we may have really done it this time .
i wish i didn &apos;t have to wait to take a pregnancy test .
you may want to get some more of those too .
where &apos;s emma ?
oh , my god , where &apos;s emma ? where &apos;s emma ?
don &apos;t ask me . i was in there canoodling you .
okay . okay . i &apos;m sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma .
you go look across the hall , and i &apos;ll call her cell .
you better hope we &apos;re pregnant ..
because one way or another , we &apos;re giving a baby back to rachel !
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m crying in front of you .
you must think i &apos;m so pathetic .
no , no , no , i admire a man who can cry .
really ?
don &apos;t touch my coat .
sorry , that &apos;s my phone .
hello ?
hey , rach , how &apos;s it going ?
oh , my god , this is the worst date ever .
oh , come on .
look , you know what , i &apos;m sorry , but did you really think that this was going well ?
what &apos;s up ?
hey , did you stop by here ?
no .
oh , my god ! then ..
thank god ! emma , there you are !
what ? what do you mean , &quot; there you are &quot; ? where was she ?
we were playing peekaboo . she loves it when i &apos;m dramatic .
why the hell did you take her ?
because you two were having sex !
no , we weren &apos;t .
don &apos;t you lie to me .
i can tell by chandler &apos;s hair . you are so lazy . can &apos;t you get on top for once ?
all right . all right , we were .
we &apos;re trying to make a baby . monica &apos;s ovulating .
which is more than i can say for myself as of 2 : 00 today .
guys !
seriously , those sticks are expensive !
it &apos;s unacceptable that you &apos;d have sex with emma in the next room .
i &apos;ll have to tell rachel about this .
please don &apos;t . she will kill us .
hey , i gotta . unless ..
unless what ?
unless you name your first @-@ born child joey .
what ? why ?
hey , i may never have kids ..
and somebody &apos;s gotta carry on my family name .
your family name is tribbiani .
you almost had me .
look ..
i think i know the answer to this question , but ..
would you like to make love to me ?
really , really not .
it &apos;s just as well .
it doesn &apos;t work anyway .
all right , well , that &apos;s good to know . good night , steve .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
i just had a rough night .
crab cake ?
well , what happened ?
this is kind of weird to talk to you about this , but ..
monica told me you had a blind date .
yeah .
i did too .
but is it technically a date if the other person doesn &apos;t show up ?
oh , no . do you think she walked in , saw you and left ?
why does everyone keep saying that ?
if it makes you feel any better , i wish my date hadn &apos;t shown up .
that bad ?
well , he makes t @-@ shirts for a living ..
and he thought it would be appropriate to give me ..
this .
&quot; female body inspector &quot; ?
what size is that ?
now wait a minute . so they &apos;re gonna name their first child joey ?
how do i get them to name the next one after me ?
it &apos;s easy . you just walk in on them having sex .
oh , so they owe me , like , three phoebes .
oh , my god ! look , it &apos;s ross and rachel !
the plan is working !
don &apos;t do the plan laugh .
the first dates we &apos;ve had in months , and they were both such disasters .
you know , it is weird ..
that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful ..
on the same night joey set you up on a date that didn &apos;t even show .
wait a minute .
you don &apos;t think it was intentional ?
i mean , that &apos;s just stupid .
we &apos;re geniuses .
look at them ! they &apos;re really bonding .
they &apos;re falling in love all over again .
oh , they see us . oh , they look mad .
they figured it out . they &apos;re coming . run !
where ?
mexico !
can you believe they &apos;re still not here ?
i know . a double blind date and we both get stood up .
what are the chances ?
i know , i &apos;m so bummed .
could we have our free crab cakes now ?
what ?
we &apos;ve been stood up .
and we want our free crab cakes .
you were stood up here last night .
i know . it hurts .
being stood up two nights in a row has left a crab cake sized hole in my heart .
guys , give it a rest . nobody &apos;s betting on you tonight .
although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry .
i have such fat hands !
