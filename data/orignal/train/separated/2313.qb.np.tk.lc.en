for over a century , i have lived in secret .
until now .
i know the risk , but i have to know her .
elena . she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
what happened to your face ?
it &apos;s nothing .
it didn &apos;t look like nothing .
matty tells me you broke his heart .
mom .
he found his rebound girl .
there &apos;s a tomb underneath the church .
you saved everyone in the church ?
27 vampires , damon .
you can &apos;t just bring them back .
it &apos;s harper .
i &apos;m glad you found us .
annabella . close the door , please .
that t @-@ shirt ...
hey . bethanne .
it &apos;s bargain .
you guys have been watching the same thing the whole time ?
there are over one hundred channels . it &apos;s called a remote control .
this button changes the channel .
hold it like this .
did you get enough , sweetheart ?
for now .
anna , are you hungry ?
do you want a little ?
no . thank you , miss givens .
why don &apos;t you lay down for a while and get some rest ?
she &apos;s fine .
aren &apos;t you , miss givens ?
of course , i am .
i &apos;m fine .
hey , mom .
mom .
hey , mom .
what ? i &apos;m trying to sleep .
uh , i was just making sure you were alive .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
it was a late night .
my head is throbbing .
yeah , um ,
i &apos;d appreciate it
if you wouldn &apos;t bring the party home .
and i &apos;m pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it , too .
it wasn &apos;t a party . it was one guy .
don &apos;t be so judgy .
yeah , well ,
i talked tooberta at the grill
and there &apos;s still a bartending position open .
if you , uh , wanted to get a job .
well , i figured she &apos;d still be pissed
about the last time i worked there .
i think she &apos;s desperate .
i &apos;ll check it out .
yeah ?
don &apos;t act so surprised .
well , i mean , i just ...
i didn &apos;t know how long you planned on sticking around here .
well , there &apos;s background due .
it &apos;s back in everything , mom .
like i said , i &apos;ll check it out .
who &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s caroline .
easy .
yeah , come in .
hi , mrs. donovan .
i , uh .
ok , well , we &apos;re gonna be late ,
so , let &apos;s just get going .
yeah .
how are you ?
good .
damon hasn &apos;t said a word to me .
every time i try to talk to him , he shuts me down .
do you think he &apos;s still trying to find katherine ?
i don &apos;t know .
he waited 145 years ,
only to find out that katherine could not care less .
i mean , that &apos;s gotta hurt , right ?
and it couldn &apos;t have happened to a nicer guy .
you have every reason to be upset with him .
have you thought any more about what you &apos;re going to do ?
about what ?
isobel , my vampire birth mother ,
who &apos;s related to my vampire ancestor katherine ,
who screwed over your vampire brother .
nah . haven &apos;t thought about it at all .
i &apos;m sorry i brought it up .
it &apos;d just be nice if we could get through one day
without having to deal with any of it .
no vampire mother or brother .
no vampires at all ?
no vampires but you .
i just want to get us back to normal stuff .
like school .
and homework .
and here &apos;s a thought .
fun .
ooh , that sounds good to me .
when do we start ?
we can watch a movie at my place .
uh , with your mom ?
and a 6 @-@ pack ?
you know , you don &apos;t really help the situation .
you could at least try to be nice .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s hard for me to show kindness
to people that hate me .
i &apos;m not that evolved .
so , what movie tonight ?
whatever you want to do is fine by me .
but i &apos;m late and i gotta go , ok ?
bye .
and the keypad is for texting ,
which is what you do
when you want to avoid talking to someone .
hey , anna , it &apos;s me .
i haven &apos;t heard from you .
i am-- i didn &apos;t break it , i sware
i was just showing harper what you taught me .
what a marvelous device .
who was that ?
jeremy gilbert .
is that your boyfriend ?
of course not .
uh , what do you think ?
you &apos;re very respectable .
that &apos;s the goal .
i can &apos;t say that i miss corsets .
susie sunshine gave me her car keys
and her atm card .
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;ll explain later .
where are you going ?
we have some business in town .
we &apos;ll be back as soon as we can .
i trust that you &apos;ll keep an eye on things .
so , i &apos;m the babysitter now .
frederick .
if this is going to work ,
we have to cooperate with one another .
so you say .
i &apos;ll watch things , miss pearl .
thank you , harper .
i &apos;m thinking nothing huge ,
just dinner at the grill ,
maybe late movie .
you mean like a double date ?
2 pair out on a friday night ,
coupled .
yeah , a double date .
do you think that &apos;s a good idea ?
why not ?
you know , we all haven &apos;t gone out together before
and i don &apos;t want it to be uncomfortable for us .
like , the couple dynamics have changed ,
and there &apos;s been a little awkwardness
between you , matt and me ,
and i just think it &apos;s important
that we get over it .
i don &apos;t know .
you know what ?
i--i think that sounds like a great idea .
you do ?
yeah .
yeah , a nice evening
out with friends .
sounds fun .
as in fun .
hmm ?
a double date it is .
ok .
so , we will see you tonight .
ok .
ok .
ok .
hello , damon .
ever hear of knocking ?
an invitation wasn &apos;t necessary .
i &apos;m surprised that no living person resides here .
is it just you and your brother ?
yeah .
how do you keep off all the vampires ?
killed &apos; em .
damn !
have a seat , damon .
i was hoping we could have a word .
sure .
freak .
we &apos;ve taken up residence
at a farm house just outside of town .
it &apos;ll suffice for now .
all 25 vampires ?
not all . some .
i imagine that a few have already left town .
others are probably still in the woods
or , like us , acclimating .
how &apos;d they get out of the tomb ?
i think that we screwed up
that part of our hocus @-@ pocus .
i understand from anna
that the founding families still have a secretcouncil ?
and you &apos;re a part of it .
pfft . that &apos;s ridiculous .
i &apos;ve been in mystic falls since the comet , damon .
i &apos;m up to speed .
so am i.
and now that you &apos;ve infiltrated the council ,
i &apos;ll need to know everything they know .
starting with a list of names
of all the council members and their families .
and everyone you &apos;ve supplied with vervain .
yes , that will have to stop immediately .
what exactly are you trying to achieve ?
mystic falls is our home , damon .
they took that from us .
our land , our home .
it &apos;s time we rebuild .
what , are you crazy ?
that was 1864 .
wake up , woman .
the world has moved on .
as a reward for your help ,
i &apos;m willing to give you what you want most .
i want nothing .
katherine .
you wouldn &apos;t even know where she was .
you &apos;ve been under the ground
for the last 1.1 / 2 centuries .
katherine and i were best friends
long before we came to mystic falls , damon .
i know how she thinks .
i know her patterns .
i know where to find her .
i no longer have any desire to see katherine
ever again .
and there &apos;s no way in hell i &apos;m gonna play the role of your little minion .
i &apos;m not asking for your help , damon .
finding katherine
was just a mere gesture of kindness .
the rest is non @-@ negotiable .
i have 400 years on you , little boy .
i &apos;ll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking and you know it .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
you got me flowers .
well , i figured it &apos;s a date ,
why not do it right ?
i would have driven , too ,
but you &apos;re the one with the car .
you know , you &apos;d think that for someone who was around
when the car was invented , that you &apos;d have one .
oh , i have one .
i just never drive it .
you know , it &apos;s not too late to cancel .
why would we do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
it just seems surreal .
like maybe we weren &apos;t meant
to get to the normal part .
that &apos;s exactly why we &apos;re going to do it .
we &apos;re going to go out ,
have some fun ,
and try to remember that we don &apos;t have to be so serious .
listen , when i decided to stay here and to get to know you ,
it was so that i could do things like this .
i could bring my girlfriend flowers ,
take her out on a date ,
try to be normal .
have you ever even been on a double date before ?
oh , absolutely .
um , 1972 . hef and the twins .
what ?
yeah . playmates . i got miss . june .
are you serious ?
miss sommers ?
yes ? hi , pearl .
hi . this is my daughter annabelle .
of course . jeremy &apos;s friend .
nice to see you , miss sommers .
oh , jenna , please .
this property was in
my brother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s family for generations .
it &apos;s one of the original structures in mystic falls ,
used to be one of those old @-@ fashioned drug store thingies .
you mean an apothecary ?
you don &apos;t say .
sorry , if it &apos;s musty .
no one &apos;s been in here for quite some time .
i &apos;ll use my imagination .
annabelle .
coming , mother .
what &apos;s with the glasses inside ?
ahem , my eyes are a little sensitive today .
you &apos;re new around here .
oh , on the contrary .
i &apos;m very old .
bourbon neat
i haven &apos;t been gone that long .
i would remember someone who looked like you .
yeah ? where &apos;d you go ?
around , about .
been there .
i love to see a man drown his sorrows .
it &apos;so sxy .
it &apos;s more like nursing my wounds .
and you ?
i was supposed to be interviewing for the bartender job ,
but , um , i think the manager blew me off .
well , that &apos;s not very nice .
yeah . last time i was in town ,
i slept with her boyfriend .
well , that &apos;s not very nice , either .
it happens .
yes , it does .
kelly ?
kelly donovan .
jen !
i heard you were back in town .
you used to baby @-@ sit me
and then , i used to party with her .
this woman was crazy .
not as crazy as you .
ha , not anymore .
well , sit , drink .
uh , i shouldn &apos;t .
i &apos;m responsible now , haven &apos;t you heard ?
then take a night off . it &apos;s good for the soul .
great for the soul .
this is not gonna end well .
can &apos;t wait .
i hate this house .
it &apos;s better than the tomb .
i didn &apos;t stay locked up for 145 years
to end up locked up here .
maybe you should quit complaining .
you gonna stop me ?
let it be , frederick .
you heard what pearl said .
i don &apos;t care what pearl said .
what you got , boy ?
try that again .
back off .
back off .
we don &apos;t fight each other .
those are the rules .
and i &apos;m tired of your rules . i want out of this house .
why can &apos;t we go into town ?
eventually .
but for now , we have to keep a low profile .
no one knows who i am .
the salvatore brothers do .
and i wish to hell i could run into them .
they &apos;re the reason we were caught in the first place .
so , uh , matt , how do you like working here ?
uh , it &apos;s not that bad .
wait staff comes out pretty good .
you know , they can &apos;t keep a bartender to save their lives .
i actually put my mom up for the job .
how &apos;s that been ?
having kelly back ?
you know , the same old kelly .
she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s trying , sort of .
kelly and my mom were best friends growing up .
that &apos;s how matt and i first met .
we shared a crib together .
you &apos;re kidding .
no , we &apos;ve , uh , known each other our whole lives .
you gotta be kidding me .
where are you going ?
bethanne and i are going out for a bit .
hit the town . kick up our heels .
but we &apos;re not supposed to leave .
miss pearl made that very clear .
you gonna stop me ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
anna .
surprised ?
i , uh , i thought you and your mom were leaving town .
oh , change of plans .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought you &apos;d be psyched .
no ! no , no , i mean , i am .
of course i am .
all right , then .
step aside .
don &apos;t be grumpy .
it can &apos;t be that bad .
you &apos;d be surprised .
my primary reason for existence has abandoned me .
and , after today &apos;s events ,
the remains of the shaky ground that i walk on
are about to go kaboom .
let &apos;s get hammered .
let &apos;s .
at least they &apos;re having fun .
they &apos;re drunk .
remember when elena &apos;s parents busted us here
after homecoming ?
oh , my god , yes !
we were wasted .
it was the first time i ever got drunk .
i blame matt .
her parents got seated at the next booth .
oh , and matt had me pretend that i was choking
so we could get away .
except her dad was a doctor ,
so , he jumped up to save her .
and i ran and slipped on the wet floor
and bit it .
in front of everyone .
do you remember that ?
3 stitches , a hangover for days ,
and i was grounded from seeing this one for a week .
well , i &apos;m gonna go to the restroom .
elena ?
quick , hide .
we &apos;re not here .
why ? where &apos;d we go ?
children under our care at 5 : 00 o &apos;clock .
this is not role modelish .
damn .
ok , so , uh , what made you and your mom
decide to stay in town ?
oh , she got this business opportunity .
she &apos;s gonna open up a little store .
it &apos;s always be her dream .
so , yeah , we &apos;re staying .
and i &apos;m thinking about going back to high school .
so , you &apos;ll be seeing a lot more of me .
oh , yeah ?
enough of home schooling .
you know ? i &apos;d like to be a normal teen for once .
but i have to ask my mom first .
she &apos;ll have an opinion .
yeah , well , i wish you were there now .
i actually have to write another paper .
i was thinking about squeezing one more out
on the vampires of mystic falls .
really ?
haven &apos;t you exhausted the subject ?
no . no , i want to go deeper , you know ?
i want to understand why people were labeled as vampires
back in the day .
i mean , maybe there is such a thing as vampires .
they &apos;re just different from the way we always thought they were .
what do you mean ?
maybe they &apos;re normal and good ,
just outsiders , you know ?
um , misunderstood .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
don &apos;t you think it could be possible ?
you did give me all that info .
jeremy , i made it up , ok ?
i mean , you were all cute and fluffy
and i wanted to make a good impression .
is there anything you &apos;re not good at ?
double dating .
this is all kinda new to me .
i usually keep to myself .
i don &apos;t always fit in .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re that guy .
what guy ?
the guy who seems like he has everything
so , people don &apos;t kinda run the other way .
is that what i seem like ?
pretty much .
what a dick .
what are you doing ?
what ?
well , the point of this
was to show him how much you care about stefan .
you &apos;re not to hopscotch down memory lane .
i was just trying to make conversation .
well , try less .
caroline .
katherine .
i &apos;m sorry . you have the wrong person .
elena , come on .
my mistake .
how &apos;s everything going ?
matt &apos;s cheating .
no need . i &apos;m awesome .
stefan salvatore .
is everything ok ?
everything &apos;s great .
that man over there just called me katherine .
so , you didn &apos;t recognize him ?
you haven &apos;t seen him before ?
no , there was nothing familiar about him at all .
all right . let &apos;s call it a night .
you know ? send matt and caroline home ?
you know , the whole point of tonight was to not have to deal with this stuff .
we need to get through one night ,
one normal night .
you sure ?
no , i &apos;m not sure .
but i don &apos;t know what else to do .
look , if there &apos;s another vampire in town ,
he &apos;ll still be here tomorrow .
we &apos;ll deal with it tomorrow .
ok .
oh , it &apos;s them .
come here .
uh , yeah , this is much better than watching &quot; damon visit cougar town . &quot;
no offense .
don &apos;t remind me .
man , i &apos;ve always wanted to see
what it looks like in this place .
yeah , i guess it &apos;s , uh , a bit watch .
ha ! yeah , my entire house could fit in here , like , twice .
i feel like i &apos;ve been here before .
it &apos;s weird .
do you guys wanna watch a movie or something ?
whoa , these are great .
that &apos;s , uh ,
just a little hobby of mine .
i did the entire mustang series
when i was 9 .
you like cars ?
that &apos;s an understatement .
come with me .
so , the thing about cherries ,
you have to ...
oh , my goddness .
that &apos;s amazing . you were quick .
and that would be my cue .
you giving up already ?
oh , yeah .
see you guys .
prepare yourself , my friend .
whoa , wait .
how do you have this ?
got passed down through the family .
why don &apos;t--
why don &apos;t you drive it ?
well , it , uh , doesn &apos;t run .
i mean , it &apos;s not that i could figure out .
why would you keep a car that doesn &apos;t run ?
be more of a girl right now .
hey , why don &apos;t you come take a look at this for me ?
elena ,
remember the old camaro your dad used to have ?
of course .
hey , i built and rebuilt that engine 20 times .
well , i don &apos;t like sports cars .
they &apos;re too hard to make out in
nah , it wasn &apos;t that bad .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
no , no .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you and elena , you guys have a history
and ignoring it doesn &apos;t do anybody any good .
she &apos;s good with you .
you know , i wasn &apos;t sure , but she &apos;s happy
and i &apos;m glad .
all right . let &apos;s take a look at this .
damn it !
need some help ?
damn it !
stupid shoe .
gotta pick up your other foot .
thanks .
there you go .
thanks .
i think .
was that damon salvatore you were with ?
the one and only .
you know him ?
we go way back .
he still live out by miller lane ?
uh , he lives in the old boarding house .
by wickery bridge .
he &apos;s still in there
if you wanna say &quot; hi . &quot;
i &apos;d rather stay here and talk to you .
nice .
very smooth with the shoe and the flirt .
but i &apos;m a little drunk .
and hot guy plus drunk me equals very bad things .
no .
i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;d like it .
sorry .
that was a seriously lame pick @-@ up .
i &apos;m sorry .
that is a nice scent you &apos;re wearing .
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
it was a gift .
and that is a cab , so .
vervain .
making it hard to find something to eat in this town .
caroline
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
you are being ridiculous .
and insecure and stupid .
but that doesn &apos;t change the fact
that matt &apos;s always gonna be in love with you
and i &apos;m always gonna be the backup .
you &apos;re not the backup .
yes , i am .
i &apos;m matt &apos;s elena backup .
i &apos;m your bonnie backup .
now it &apos;s about me and bonnie ?
you don &apos;t get it .
why would you ?
you &apos;re everyone &apos;s first choice .
piece of cake .
you know what ?
why don &apos;t you guys go ahead
and take it for a spin ?
really ?
yeah .
caroline .
you all right ?
if it &apos;s not vampire &apos;s , it &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s .
all right . roast beef , turkey .
what do you want ?
oh , let &apos;s do the works .
pile it high .
all right . i like your style .
will you grab the bread for me ?
ok .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s just a cut .
will you hand me that towel ?
i--i--i can &apos;t .
you got a problem with blood , anna ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s just blood , anna .
what are you doing ?
i knew it .
go for it .
jeremy .
jenna . hey , what &apos;s , uh ...
what &apos;s up ?
regret .
make sure you lock that up .
did i just pass their driveway ?
uh , i think it &apos;s up there .
this is an amazing car .
did i pass ?
the whole double date thing
was obviously a test
to see how i would do around elena .
i don &apos;t know .
you were reminiscing
about the elena years all night .
caroline ,
that stuff came before , ok ?
it &apos;s not just gonna go away .
i know that , ok ?
no . no , you don &apos;t .
because you &apos;re letting it turn you into a crazy person .
look , it &apos;s my fault .
i , you know , i made it pretty clear early on
that elena still means something to me .
but all that talk ,
that was just
2 old friends and some memories .
tonight wasn &apos;t about me and elena .
i was there
because i wanted to be with you .
and i don &apos;t know what this means
or what we are ,
but i do know that you &apos;re the only person
i want to be in this car with right now .
i don &apos;t even know if this makes sense ,
because i &apos;m not really that good at expressing myself .
no , no .
i think you &apos;re doing just fine .
sports cars .
yeah .
now that you &apos;ve got me here .
what are you gonna do with me ?
i &apos;m going to--
going to do this .
mom ?
damon ?
oh , my god . matt .
oh , my god .
i gotta ...
it &apos;s fine . just go .
i ... i &apos;ll take her home .
thanks , man .
where have you been ?
um , i needed some air .
for 3 hours ?
tell me . where have you been ?
out .
i was out .
annabelle , don &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t fight you , too .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
sorry i &apos;m bailing .
just wish you &apos;d let me drive you home .
normal people don &apos;t have chaperones
or bodyguards or babysitters .
we &apos;re normal tonight , remember ?
i know , i just get so worried about you .
stefan , i can &apos;t live every minute
afraid that someone &apos;s gonna come after me .
i won &apos;t .
that &apos;s not living .
ok .
call me when you get home safe ?
mm @-@ hmm .
ok .
bye , stefan .
bye .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
are you crazy ?
save the lecture . look ...
damn it .
i remember them .
from 1864 .
they were in the tomb .
yeah .
about that .
matt .
matt .
i don &apos;t wanna hear it , mom .
look .
matty , please .
do you know what i was doing tonight , mom ?
i was having fun .
you know , trying to forget about
all the crap that i have to deal with every day ?
just enjoy a night with my friends .
and then , there you are .
wasted at the bar ,
where i work , by the way .
to pay the bills that you don &apos;t pay .
and then you &apos;re off acting like a freaking kid ?
hookin &apos; up with some guy half your age .
i &apos;m the kid , mom .
you &apos;re supposed to be responsible for me .
i know , matt .
how was your night ?
oh , same old , same old . you ?
yep .
so , where &apos;s bethanne ?
she won &apos;t be coming back .
what happened ? where is she ?
well , you were right .
we shouldn &apos;t have left .
no .
you hungry ?
next time , you &apos;ll listen to me .
i &apos;m home .
teeth brushed , ready for bed .
safe and sound .
oh , good . i &apos;m glad .
is everything all right ?
you sound serious .
no , no .
uh , not tonight .
you still have a few more minutes left of normal .
i &apos;ll pay you back tomorrow , ok ?
i had a really nice time on our date tonight .
such a liar .
no , i &apos;m serious .
in a way , it was exactly what it was supposed to be .
i had a really nice time , too .
could you help me out a little bit ?
what the hell ?
i could have killed you .
yeah , but you didn &apos;t .
i should have .
but you didn &apos;t .
how did you know ?
i knew this girl .
vicki .
she , uh ,
she was attacked by an animal ,
a bite to the neck .
she started acting crazy .
you know , weird ,
and it ... and it seemed like drugs ,
but then , you showed me those articles .
and then , i saw your face , and how it changed .
that night in the cemetery when i kissed you .
look .
you know you can &apos;t tell anyone , right ?
ha . who &apos;d believe me ?
you &apos;d be surprised .
why didn &apos;t you kill me ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe i &apos;m a sucker for guys like you .
like what ?
lost .
why would you confront me about it ?
why would you risk it ?
because if it was true maybe ,
maybe it &apos;s true about vicki .
and also because ...
