Agent Rebecca Stone, Homeland Security.
I've been undercover
building a case against the Graysons --
You'll wear this wire.
We'll watch your every move
until you get a confession from Conrad.
I think Pascal is talking to Homeland Security.
The only person he has to offer up is dad, right?
Pascal has been talking to the feds.
Pascal...
Watch out!
I tried to warn him, but it was too late.
No, no!
Who wrote this?
I have a guess.
It can't be David Clarke.
Digital stamp from a local post office
and tracks to...
A cabin in the middle of the Berkshires.
So, this really is just some sicko trying to mess with me.
Let's go before he comes home.
Seized...
Confined...
Captive.
Six years of my youth were spent that way.
No!
Cooperate and you'll be fine.
In juvenile detention, many lost hope.
For me, being locked away was an impetus for revenge
帕斯卡·勒马尔查尔去世
and for the vow that once I got out,
I would punish those who took my freedom.
Did you get it?
Everything we need.
Remember when I used to drag you here as a little boy
to go bird-watching?
You hated it.
I actually loved those times, mom.
Well, enjoy their songs while you can, Daniel.
They'll soon be taking off for warmer weather.
Everyone leaves.
Pascal didn't choose to go.
I still can't get the horror of last night out of my head.
Conrad will pay for what he's done,
as will Emily Thorne.
Why do you think she was involved?
Just before he went with your father on the roof,
Pascal shared a look with Emily,
and it was as if she was ordering him there.
Yeah, the Homeland Security agent
that Pascal was working with was a woman.
A ghost whose number has been disconnected.
Yeah, I'll look into it.
In the meantime, you need to get home,
get some rest.
Sleep can wait, Daniel.
I have vermin to stalk.
Thanks for meeting with me, detective.
My family and I are in shock and desperate for details.
I was hoping you could share your findings.
Here's what I got -- uh, the two eyewitnesses,
Conrad Grayson and the helicopter pilot,
were questioned last night.
Their accounts match.
Mr. Lemarchal stepped backwards,
stumbled, and fell.
So you're ruling it an accident.
Unless I learn something that suggests otherwise.
You know, we found an odd thing at the scene.
It was pretty curious, actually.
Did you know your dad was wearing a wire?
No.
I checked with other law-enforcement agencies
to see if he was working with any of them.
He wasn't.
My father was known to tape business conversations
with those he found untrustworthy.
He did not trust Conrad Grayson.
Then you think what I think --
There's more to this than we know.
Emily. Hey. This is my third message.
I need to show you something.
Might be nothing, but just --
just in case, call me when you get this.
Jack, right?
Javier. Nolan's federal pen pal.
Had me help you out on the phone a while back.
Well, from what I hear,
your friendship status is debatable.
Anyway, I'm, uh, I'm looking for Charlotte.
She hasn't answered any calls or texts since last night,
so I traced her phone signal,
and the last ping off the cell tower
originated from here, around 10:00.
That was when her phone died and she left.
Did she say anything --
Where she was going, plans for today?
I'm gonna check in with some people.
I'll call you if I find out anything, okay?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Yeah. Thank you.
未知号码
I have your daughter.
Would you like to get her back?
Who is this?
Flight 197 destroyed many lives,
so I'm destroying yours.
To ensure Charlotte's safe return,
you and her mother
will confess your involvement in that terrorist act
and the subsequent framing of an innocent man.
Do not alert the police or anyone else,
or there will be consequences.
This is worse than I thought.
Nice job on the voice-altering program.
Love the compliment,
but what I need is reassurance
that what we are doing is not completely messed up.
With Pascal dead, Charlotte's all I have left.
She's the only person
that Victoria and Conrad would do anything for.
Don't answer!
It's Jack. He's called twice.
What if he's in trouble?
No contact with anybody outside this group until this is over.
I couldn't get her to eat anything.
And are the cuffs really necessary?
You don't kidnap somebody halfway, Nolan.
I would never hurt Charlotte, Nolan.
If you don't trust me, there's the door.
Look, I want you here,
but if you stay, this plan doesn't end
until Victoria and Conrad are behind bars tonight.
So?
So...
let's bag some Graysons.
第三季第二十一集
As predicted, Conrad placed a call.
Duke Marino -- one of his thugs-for-hire.
I am hijacking the line,
sending it to a dummy voicemail.
杜克·马里诺 虚拟线路
You have reached the mailbox of 555-0183.
Leave a message.
Mr. Marino, this is Conrad Grayson.
Meet me at Wharf 16 in an hour.
Right, then. Off to the morgue.
You shouldn't be here.
My father would want me to be strong.
I wrote his obituary this morning.
The time we shared here
allowed me to honor him as a daughter,
not just his employee.
Our last exchange was such a good one.
He told me he --
he loved me and was proud of my accomplishments.
Hey, you're gonna get through this, okay?
What are you watching?
Uh, well, the detective on the case
asked for all security footage from LeMarchal headquarters.
I made a copy for myself.
Why -- why would you do that?
You think my Dad killed Pascal?
Yes.
I think he did, too.
It's no secret my dad was gunning for him on the business side,
but as soon as Pascal and my mother rekindled their relationship,
tensions escalated.
To the point where my father was wearing a wire
the night he died.
He must have wanted to capture something incriminating on Conrad.
And Conrad must have found out.
And how is this for a coincidence?
Any camera with a clear view of the helipad
was out of order.
But look what I just discovered.
Here is the stairwell from the roof
seconds after the accident.
I don't recognize her.
Do you?
Not at all.
Please -- don't come any closer.
Call a televised press conference
for 6:00 P.M. at Grayson manor.
Do this, and Charlotte goes free.
Disobey me again...
and more of what's in the box will arrive.
What are you doing?!
Please -- don't come any closer!
Talk about a software suck-it.
I fixed the bugs in Javier's Myclone app.
This may as well be Charlotte Grayson in the flesh.
No!
That's enough.
Easy, Judge Judy.
You were the one that sent Conrad an ear.
I mean, seriously, do you and Aiden flip a coin
for who runs the creepiest errand?
What's the first thing you think you'll do
as Amanda Clarke?
I mean, you've been running this race since you were a kid.
You haven't even fantasized about what happens
when you cross the finish line?
You know what always stuck with me?
That time that you implied I was a robot.
Ems, we were in a fight. I didn't...
Emily Thorne is a machine.
That's why I created her.
I had to find a way not to feel.
The truth is...
I have no idea who Amanda Clarke is anymore.
Did you hurt yourself, little mouse?
I'm the nanny. Is he okay?
Oh, it's just a little scratch.
We all have to take our bumps and bruises,
don't we, little Carl?
I was looking for Jack.
Oh, he's at work. Can I give him a message?
You're very kind.
But I was hoping to catch him in person.
Stop!
246 passenger fatalities
in the bombing of the jumbo jet.
For too long, you've heard the rumors
of Conrad Grayson's immoral acts
and then buried your head in the sand.
Today, I'm showing you the truth.
What?
The bombing of Flight 197 decimated my family.
Did you ever wonder about the people who died that day,
slaughtered by Conrad Grayson?
He's a businessman! He didn't put a bomb on a plane!
He laundered money for the terrorists who did.
He's just as guilty.
For the downing of Flight 197,
all 246 Americans on board that flight were killed.
Kelly and Patrick Simmons.
Uzarski family.
Erin Mayo.
Brett and Elizabeth Richards.
I don't want to torture you.
I want to teach you.
Charlotte, please -- open your eyes.
Richard Lucas.
Derek Wilson.
When exposure threatened your family's life of privilege,
Conrad turned to your mother to cover his tracks.
She chose David Clarke,
your father, to take the fall.
大卫·克拉克审判案
Moments ago, a jury found terrorist conspirator David Clarke
guilty on all counts.
But how many people would be needed
to pull off such a conspiracy?
No!
How far would they go to frame an innocent man?
Federal prosecutors wrapped up their case for treason
against disgraced hedge-fund executive David Clarke.
Grayson put you up to this, didn't he?!
Grayson's testimony detailed the scheme Clarke used
to channel money to the terrorists
高级行政层度假
responsible for the downing of Flight 197.
I have a family,
and you're sending me to prison for a crime I didn't do!
And you know it!
No more!
Who else would they eliminate to protect their plot?
Please stop!
Check out that sunset.
No!
Turn it off!
Your parents' crimes can't go unchecked any longer.
Do you have the strength to call them out?
What the hell are you doing?
Victoria.
Murderer!
How dare you show your face here!
If you'd answered my calls,
you'd know Charlotte's been abducted!
They took her and sent me this!
Now will you listen?
A man contacted me this morning.
The bombing of 197 has destroyed his life.
He blames us and demands
that we tell the world what we've done.
Oh, my god. This is -- this can't be happening.
I'm calling the authorities.
No, I already tested the boundaries.
This... was the consequence.
We'll do as he instructed --
call a press conference and come clean.
Charlotte...
shouldn't perish for our sins.
Our sins?
I will do whatever this abductor wants,
but be clear --
what's happening is a result of your deplorable,
greedy actions 20 years ago.
If Charlotte dies, this will be your fault.
If you need to lay blame, then keep in mind
that it was your romantic entanglement with David
that brought her into this world in the first place.
I showed her love when I didn't have to.
And though she was born of betrayal,
I will not let her die that way.
You abducted Charlotte to get the Graysons to confess?
How did you even find us?
Charlotte was missing.
I thought that I needed your help.
But then when you guys didn't answer my calls,
I knew something was up,
so I had her boyfriend track Nolan's phone.
Javier knows where we are?
So what?!
No one in their right mind
would think you guys are up to something this sick.
You need to leave.
Why?
So you don't have to confront your conscience?
Okay, I'm gonna take care of that...thing from home.
Jack, I am so close to the end.
By tonight, Victoria and Conrad will be finished.
Our father's name will be cleared.
What about Charlotte?
She can finally live in truth.
You will never have a relationship with your sister after this.
Do you understand that?
I need Emily.
Just Emily.
What?
She's having a panic attack.
Well, it'll pass. I had them all the time when I was a kid.
Just slow things down.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who said that we can't do things halfway.
All I can see out there is Colleen.
What happened to your sister was totally different.
She was kidnapped and used as leverage
to force my father to do something against his will.
She was terrorized, tortured, and killed.
That is not gonna happen to Charlotte. You know that.
She doesn't.
We can't allow her to suffer.
Fine. I'll go to the pharmacy.
I'll get something to calm her down.
Take Porter with you.
You kick me out,
and I will blow the whistle on this whole thing.
I'm not leaving Charlotte.
Where were you two heroes when I was 9 years old,
being dragged out of my house by men with guns,
thrown into the foster-care system?
Charlotte has always been protected,
and she will be fine now.
Take Charlotte's hair and Carl's blood to the lab,
and tell them it requires immediate attention.
And if they're busy?
I'll pay whatever it takes. Hurry, please.
A life depends on it.
Emily Thorne?
Yes?
I'm Detective Hosko, NYPD.
I think you may have some information that could help us.
We're looking into the death of Pascal LeMarchal,
Actually, I didn't know Mr. LeMarchal very well at all.
How well do you know Conrad Grayson?
He's my ex-father-in-law.
I heard he was on the roof when Mr. LeMarchal died.
Do you suspect foul play?
Is Conrad in custody?
We'll hash that out at the station.
Actually, it's really not a good time for me right now.
I'm afraid you don't have much of a choice.
Well, then... i'll meet you in the city.
You know what? There was a pileup on the L.I.E.
Traffic's backed up for miles.
Ride with me.
I'll light it up, get us there in no time.
Security cameras captured this.
Per the time stamp, this person witnessed Mr. LeMarchal
getting acquainted with that helicopter blade.
Someone says it's you.
Well, it isn't.
You were there, though.
Well, in the building, yes.
The photographer hired to document that party
doesn't have a single shot of you.
Why would that be?
What... you think I'm involved in this?
Mind answering the question?
He was probably instructed not to take my picture.
The Graysons despise me.
Really? I heard you and Mr. Grayson were tight.
You two ever discuss the ax he had to grind with Pascal?
Ems. Hey.
Detective Hosko...
I haven't talked to Conrad in weeks.
Ems?
I'm sorry I'm...not more help.
That's nice of you.
I'll admit the longer I look at this case,
the more questions I have.
For example, why was Mr. LeMarchal
wearing a wire when he died?
And whose partial print did we find on it?
That person's got to know something.
I would imagine so.
We're asking those associated with Pascal
to, uh, volunteer elimination prints.
Look, I know my rights. If you want them,
You're gonna have to charge me with something.
You want a copy of her prints,
just pull her juvie file.
My ex-wife is a former delinquent, after all.
Hang tight, Ms. Thorne.
What did you say to him?
Just that I knew my former bride's body when I saw it.
That's you in that stairwell.
No doubt.
Poor Daniel.
So bitter about our divorce.
Always trying to stir up trouble for me.
You got it, babe.
The police have Emily.
Has she been arrested?
No, but they're questioning her about Pascal.
She sly-dialed out on her phone so I could listen in.
They've got the wire we used,
and there's a partial print on it.
Can't be one of ours.
I wiped the device down before I put it on him.
Let's err on the side of caution, why don't we?
Especially since they're running the print
against Emily's juvie record.
She switched those records with Amanda when they swapped identities.
If Emily's print happens to be on that wire,
They're gonna come back belonging to a dead woman.
I am cyber-stalling the cops' search
While I hack the national database.
There's, um... just one problem I can't fix.
Daniel's at the station.
He got this whole ball rolling.
I'll get down there.
Emily's been sidelined.
I'm going to Manhattan. You watch Charlotte.
I'm not helping you.
Why are you here, Jack?
Cause I care about the innocent person locked up in there.
You're not just here for Charlotte.
You're worried about Emily.
For her soul... maybe.
You know, you.... you should know that, um...
Despite mine and Emily's numerous attempts
at making it work, it... it...
it hasn't.
I have to let her go.
But you... you obviously can't.
That's why you haven't rung the authorities already.
You still care about her.
But the problem is, you don't want her.
You want Amanda Clarke,
That girl you cherished so long ago.
Now, you will see that girl again,
but only if this plan succeeds.
Late-breaking news... Conrad and Victoria Grayson
will make a major announcement in just a few hours.
We'll be live with the details.
Money talks.
I've composed our statements.
Say what you want. I won't be there.
He clearly stipulated we both speak tonight.
I've changed my mind.
About what... saving your daughter's life?
If Charlotte was ever in danger at all.
I think you concocted this entire scenario
to trick me into incriminating myself.
Would you put your contempt aside
and pay attention?
I have crafted something
that protects both us and Charlotte.
The confessions made during this dog-and-pony show
will be considered under duress
and inadmissible in a court of law.
The kidnapper's a fool not to have realized that.
And you are a fool to think
I'd ever trust another word out of your vile mouth.
Oh, come on.
Hello?!
You sent me those letters pretending to be David Clarke,
didn't you?
I don't want to get you in trouble.
I just want to talk.
You can trust me.
Please...talk to me.
Put on the blindfold...
Now.
Did I upset you?
I didn't mean to.
Please, just tell me what's going on!
I'm letting you go.
I'm at the station. How is it on your end?
I am altering Emily and Amanda's fingerprints
so they lead to... two dead-end trails.
Brilliant.
Look, I can't hold off this detective's
database search much longer.
Can you keep him occupied
for -- I don't know -- another five minutes?
Gladly.
I can't wait for those prints to come back as yours.
It'll support a little theory I have going
that you were part of a conspiracy to kill Pascal.
The cops are gonna love it.
You sound just like your mother --
completely insane.
Did you know impersonating a federal agent carries a penalty?
Come on! Let's go! Come on! Get off him!
You saw it!
That man attacked me completely unprovoked!
Are you crying, Daniel?
No.
I'm pressing charges.
Easy. Easy.
Calm down, all right?
All right.
Thanks.
Daniel?
I spoke to Detective Hosko, who told me you were here.
How dare you take suspicions about Emily to him
without telling me.
You used this investigation
to further a vendetta against your ex-wife.
No, not a vendetta -- a hunch.
I think Emily was working with my dad.
Now, she may have posed as a department of homeland security agent
to get that wire on Pascal and Pascal up to that roof.
And why would Conrad have Emily do this?
I don't know. That's why I wanted Hosko to take a run at her.
Fake agents, recording devices --
This goes far beyond business rivalries
or jealousy over Victoria.
I didn't want you exposed to this.
I need answers, not protection.
Even if it threatens the last memory of your father?
Your prints...
...were not a match.
I'm not surprised.
How about a ride home?
I'll call a car.
Emily, that ex-husband of yours has it out for you.
Thanks for the warning.
I wasn't giving you one.
I got decent instincts about people.
After watching you today,
I'm certain there's someone dangerous
hiding in that pretty, little socialite shell.
It's Daniel Grayson who should be worried.
I'll see you around.
Even as a little girl,
I preferred to call my father "Pascal."
He was so distant to me, it seemed right.
But now I wonder if I was keeping my distance from him.
Perhaps I already sensed he was evil to his core.
How does one go on with life
knowing they've descended from so much horror?
By abandoning your soul.
Is that what you've done?
Oh, don't do what I've done.
Well, maybe I should.
If it makes dealing with these truths easier.
Please don't.
Why?
Because someday I may need you to save me.
The press conference is minutes away.
No word on what the former governor
and his ex-wife plan to share,
but when the Graysons speak, the news is often explosive.
Oh, my God.
Charlotte?
Oh, my God!
How did you get here?
We need to get you to a hospital.
Charlotte --
Your ear.
The naive deserve two things --
swindling and scorn.
That's what you always say, isn't it?
How much do you hate me, then?
Because I've been pretty damn naive until now.
You're to blame for flight 197.
You laundered money for Americon
and then arranged a cover-up by framing David Clarke.
You even silenced Amanda.
You were behind all of it.
Can you look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong?
Fine.
If you don't have the guts
to admit what you did to my real father,
I'll tell the police.
You disgust me.
And you, my dear, are an ungrateful bastard.
My love for you was so profound
that I was gonna confess to everything
to save your life.
You know what? No longer.
No. And you're not going anywhere.
You have no power over me!
No, I have the power to take you out anytime I want!
I had the reach to snuff out your nuisance of a sister.
I was in league with a confederacy of global terrorists
who tried to bring me down, but I'm still here.
And your father, the selfish and dim-witted David Clarke --
he was my patsy to freedom.
Oh, I have the power.
And my secrets are gonna rot inside of you
beyond your last breath,
because you are gonna keep
our stupid and thankless mouth shut!
I'm the last man standing for a reason.
And if you even think about crossing me,
I will erase you as I have so many others.
Are we on the air?
Now...
We are broadcasting.
I have a press conference to cancel.
Cut Charlotte's camera.
Turn on the TV in Grayson manor.
If you even think of crossing me,
I will erase you as I have so many others.
Now...
I have a press conference to cancel.
No word on how our signal was co-opted,
but it seems the transmission you just saw was live
from inside the Grayson House --
shocking footage shows
Conrad Grayson confessing to a host of illegal activities,
including terrorism, conspiracy, perjury, and murder.
Our legal analyst is standing by to share with us
the ramifications of these bombshells.
Ems.
You got him.
The authorities will be arriving any minute.
I won't waste my energy throwing you out.
Though I am surprised
that you haven't gassed up a gulfstream and gone on the lam.
Oh, running would be undignified.
Particularly after suffering the humiliation
of being sold out by your very own daughter.
Oh, that mis-born wretch is yours alone.
Though I gather she was an unwitting participant.
Charlotte was as surprised as I to discover we were being broadcast.
Given you bowed out of the press conference at the 11th hour,
I'm guessing you knew I was walking into a trap.
Question is...
did you set it?
Well, there will be many conversations where I'm going,
and do not think that I won't pull each skeleton from your closet
for the feds to pick over everything --
I mean, from killing Helen Crowley
all the way through to being my number-one co-conspirator.
Prove it.
Well, as usual...
...I'll have others do that for me.
Goodbye, Conrad.
Do rot in hell.
Sorry I didn't bail you out sooner.
Well, you were busy.
How are you feeling?
You know, I never expected to
have a relationship with Charlotte after this.
Well, if you're not gonna revel in your victory,
I wish you would at least acknowledge it.
Conrad was defeated.
Revenge is yours.
Oh, the war is not over.
There's still Victoria.
Let her be tomorrow's problem.
Tonight you should focus on something else.
You and I, we've...
We've called it quits so many times.
But we haven't been able to make that stick, really, have we?
And that's because we fit.
We belong together.
I know.
I need Emily.
Just Emily.
He told me you two were...
...you were done.
Oh it's complicated.
No surpirse there.
You know what, it's, it's none of my business.
It's good to know that everything else...
Everything else turned out.
Thanks for stepping in for Aiden.
When he asked me to set Charlotte free, I
I didn't understand how I could possibly be
the key to taking down Conrad.
Armed with the facts I knew that she would confront him
and get a confession that would hold up in court.
You were that sure?
Charlotte's a smart girl.
She's got a lot of fight in her.
We are blood, after all.
So you didn't really...
need that press conference?
No, I just needed those satellite trucks outside the house.
Did you get to watch any of it?
Emily, that's not -- that's not why I'm here.
I've been trying to tell you something since yesterday.
Charlotte received letters
from somebody pretending to be David Carke.
She and I tracked him to his house.
There was no one there, but it was like a shrine to your father.
I wrote him off as an obsessed nut, until...
Didn't your father have something like this when we were kids?
I only remember it because
there was a time that we were on the beach
And -- and you dropped it,
and you made me sift through 60 tons of sand until it turned up.
Emily?
An intention fueled by passion can be impossible to stop.
This was my father's.
Over time, it gains momentum,
until it turns into an impetus for change.
How is Charlotte?
Not good.
Hating dad.
She's mad at you, too.
Believes you're as guilty as he is.
Then she must never know that I refused the ransom demands.
What are you saying?
That the kidnapper wanted me to confess alongside Conrad.
But I acquired information today that made me certain
that Charlotte would never be harmed.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You took a gamble on your own daughter's life?
Have you lost it?
Oh, I'm very much in my right mind about many things.
Including Emily Thorne.
This is how a notion transforms into motivation...
...and how a child's vow becomes reality.
You did this.
Yes.
In memory of David and Amanda Clarke.
What about Victoria?
Oh, I'm not finished yet.
Well, then, godspeed.
