gain your father &apos;s approval to dissolve your marriage ,
and find me as wet with desire as you now stand .
news of your desires to his loving daughter lifts heart .
remove encumberance as discussed .
you &apos;ll see your child never born .
a necessary thing .
it &apos;s a red vial .
i &apos;d see its contents replaced with water and bitter herb .
your wife &apos;s slave stealing through the night .
in her hand , a thing familiar to me .
i know what i hold
and the intent it carries !
let these men not fall here tonight ,
but in the arena .
we are for the arena in capua .
i give you gannicus !
we had last faced each other upon the sands
as melitta always feared .
did you lay with her ?
oenomaus .
we will cover this land in passion
until rome falls as a cinder , to scorch brow .
spartacus .
gaius , where is my father ?
help me !
he has fallen at the hands of spartacus .
第六集
they live !
get the medicine !
get cloth to tend wounds !
what news ? !
the arena is burned to fucking ground .
with many romans among the ashes !
what of rhaskos ?
he fell as all men should .
with sword in hand and blood upon his thoughts .
you suffer no wound ?
the gods favor me , little man .
call me that again ...
and they shall turn from you .
can he be healed ?
nasir had but a single wound .
this man beyond what should warrant life .
his name is oenomaus .
and he is more than common man .
let pray the gods hold him in equal esteem .
do i yet dream ?
if so , i would never have you wake ...
then it began to collapse .
they screamed and flailed like children
as the arena burned around them .
the scent of smoke and death
carried by the winds to the very heart of rome !
lift troubled heart .
oenomaus stands a titan .
one that shall live to raise sword again .
to fight by your side ?
if he chooses to take up cause against the romans .
cause ?
you have cock to rival jupiter himself .
a few errant slaves amounts
to flies circling a bull &apos;s ass .
did he miss the part where we pulled the arena down on his head ?
rome is propped up by more than a few wooden beams .
if your cause is to see your lives cut short ,
then you march towards certain victory .
why did you choose to aid us , if you believe such ?
you mistake choice for repayment of a debt .
one owed to oenomaus .
absent it , ...
we would not be breaking words .
he is right .
we were mistaken .
to have placed faith in his intentions .
nasir once made attempt on my life ,
and yet now he stands trusted among us .
perhaps gannicus can be swayed as well .
or perhaps you should have killed him in the arena .
the witnesses in rome also attest the will grants
the family domicile in rome and the villa here in capua .
in addition there is the vineyard in atella ,
forty goats in the hills of pompeii ,
twenty head of cattle--
what is the worth of the livestock ?
nine thousand denarii , depending upon deal struck .
see them to market .
and post decree announcing reward of the coin
for knowledge leading to the capture of spartacus .
forgive me , praetor , but the law grants you no such authority
to part with these assets .
you are only to oversee senator albinius &apos; holdings
until his heir comes of age .
laws must bend toward greater purpose ,
if spartacus is to pay for what he has done .
praetor --
prattling on serves only to inflict
further wound on grieving heart .
apologies .
the memory of your father shall not soon fade .
all the republic mourns his loss .
leave us .
what moves your tears most ?
a father forever removed from loving embrace ?
or his tongue forever stilled ,
before commanding to dissolve this marriage
in favor of varinius ?
i have made a grave mistake .
and the gods have punished me
by striking down my father .
it is not enough .
gaius --
the only reason you have not joined
your father is the child that grows within you .
my child . my heir .
protect him with your life .
or see it forfeit .
we must keep appearance of mourning for the prescribed days .
i would not have the stench of grief slick upon you .
see yourself to a bath .
give report .
a hundred more bodies pulled from the arena .
this was found at wreckage .
why do our numbers stand so few ?
more have been recalled from neapolis , to return by nightfall .
yet many have taken to the wind .
they turn from their oath to rome ?
fear and panic grip the region , and our men .
many believe that spartacus unleashes the wrath of the gods .
a meaningless thing .
legions could return to swell rank .
yet still fall to spartacus and his men .
apologies , but as i warned young marcus before life fled ,
gladiators are far from common slaves .
three of your men would not equal one so trained ,
despite their eagerness to die .
no .
did you not once stand amongst the brotherhood ,
upon the sands ?
a lifetime ago .
then give lesson , ...
prove boast .
the syrian wants to taste his own blood .
come on !
what &apos;s the matter ? come on !
begin .
come on !
and i was considered lowest among the brotherhood .
would that i had an army formed in your base image .
there are others that share my reflection .
men in name only , a word masking truer nature of rabid animal .
such a force under my guidance
could prove useful in these difficult times .
the senate would frown upon lowering standard into muck and shit .
as they frown upon many things that ambitious men must embrace .
you leave these walls ?
at request of the praetor .
he blesses ashur with well deserved favor .
would that he turn such grace toward grieving wife .
it is a hard thing , to have a father torn from breast .
i never knew mine --
how did glaber come to know of the silphium in ilithyia &apos;s chambers ?
perhaps the gods spoke to him .
you forget your place .
no .
i secure it .
you secure nothing without me ,
you fucking syrian .
move against my commands again --
you command shit and piss .
i am glaber &apos;s man now .
a word from me how you knew of his wife &apos;s intent
to rob him of his unborn child ...
or how the gods are nothing to do with delivering oenomaus ...
you yet draw breath
because i have not whispered your secrets into the praetor &apos;s ear .
no , ashur . ashur .
consider it a kindness .
one i shall see repaid ...
does it hurt ?
a few cuts and scrapes .
soon faded from memory .
would that all scars were so easily erased .
i see no scars .
you risked all .
for pale shadow of the woman you once loved .
then let us ignite the sun .
and strike darkness with its warmth .
stop !
naevia ...
they have taken everything from me ...
even your touch ...
i have heard tales of your victories in the arena .
days long past .
mira tells you were just upon its sands .
standing as executioner for the romans .
i stood for a brother .
see him to an honorable death .
and rhaskos ?
did he find the same ?
the man held some meaning to you ?
he elevated position .
i gave comfort .
it appears that bargain has come to an end .
i would see another struck .
with a man of greater worth ...
i hold no position among these men .
nor do i seek it .
yet you stand among them .
i seek only words with an old friend .
nothing more .
we are here , in the shadow of vesuvius .
a single man placed upon
its crest would have clear view for many miles in all direction .
a roman advance easily spotted .
is there a way to its peak ?
a single path .
narrow , but easily tread .
the rest is sheer rock .
impassable , absent wings .
we will choose three men ,
of years beyond the taking up of sword .
each to command a separate watch .
there &apos;s but one entrance to the temple .
the romans could easily trap us inside .
tunnels extend below our feet .
perhaps one can be dug beyond these walls .
a few men with bows would give the romans pause
long enough to make use of it , if walkway were built .
how many among you shoot with purpose ?
there is not much call for arrows in the arena .
you no longer fight upon the sands .
nor can you forge a sword from a fucking tree .
then we will fashion weapons from what nature provides .
with practiced hand instructing in their use .
we can train until the gods take us .
house slaves will never be gladiators ,
something we are in short supply of now .
we need fighting men .
perhaps it is time to revisit plans towards neapolis .
and its slaver ships from foreign wars .
you would attack the port ?
with so few men ?
we brought the arena down with less .
take two men and what coin we have .
weight palm in neapolis to loosen tongue of ships soon to dock .
apologies .
i did not intend to halt conversation .
unless i can drink that ,
it holds no worth to me .
i seek only wine .
we have none .
then i truly am among the damned .
for both of you ?
i &apos;m a whore . not a fool .
i would have words .
fuck your words .
it is not with you that i seek them .
i have an offer to discuss .
one suited to your particular talents ...
apologies .
i did not think you would need the bath ,
with days of mourning yet left .
my husband commands it , despite tradition .
stay .
i would have your company .
your eyes betray recent tears .
events weigh heavy on the heart .
to the point of crushing it .
why did the gods not warn of spartacus &apos; attack ?
or of my father &apos;s --
do they punish me ?
a life , for the one i had planned to take ...
we both carry the burden of our acts .
if the gods have cast us adrift ,
we must together discover the course
to return to the blessing of their shores .
varinius has turned from me .
gaius ...
i fear not even the gods could sway his hatred of me now .
resume appearance of loving wife .
submit to his will ...
the day will come when he will lose sight of hateful intention .
a slip , however fleeting ,
that we shall take advantage of .
there was a time
when all i dreamt of was your throat beneath my hands .
now your breath is all that gives me life .
i shall not be moved from your side .
until my own husband calls me to the afterlife .
i have seen that look .
it often fell upon me ,
when we were yet beneath batiatus &apos; roof .
you knew gannicus there ,
years before my arrival ....
what is your opinion of the man ?
he is a champion , as we once stood .
a boon to your cause .
he has expressed doubts towards it .
as have we all .
and yet you always find way to convince otherwise .
we have done the impossible .
we have brought down the arena in capua .
a monument of rome built upon the backs of slaves .
we have struck a deep blow to the very heart of our enemy .
yet their numbers are vast .
as vast as their desire to see freedom crushed beneath heel .
one day , perhaps soon ,
they will strike back .
how do we avoid them ?
i do not intend to .
how ? is that true ?
if we are to face the might of rome ,
i would do it here .
in the shadow of vesuvius .
upon terms that we set .
no hand will stand idle .
we must prepare ourselves for what is to come .
what is to come ?
what is to happen to us ?
proper weapons are in short supply .
fashion what you can from wood and stone , util more can be secured .
i would also see the tunnels
beneath our feet further dug towards escape , which we will need .
to set eyes again upon your heart .
i understand now why a man would risk all for such a thing .
if it were not for you and the others ,
i would have fallen in the arena .
never to gaze upon her face again in this life .
it is a thing i will not forget .
... continue to hone skill .
nor the lie you told ,
that saw her stay in that place another fucking day .
she is safe now .
all other things fall to unimportance .
do you think a few words can change all that has happened ?
you stand a larger fool than i thought .
... be more dangerous than a thousand men .
apologies .
the mistake was mine .
to offer comfort to a fucking gaul .
you offer shit !
regain yourself !
crixus !
i thought we had moved past this .
wounds still linger .
i move for neapolis .
and thoughts of swelling rank with better men .
you need not fear the romans .
your own men make attempt to kill each other .
you know what must be done .
see to it .
gannicus .
i would have words .
you would have me fight ?
i would have you hunt .
everyone has been set to purpose .
ours is to provide meat .
you spoke of a debt to oenomaus .
was saving his life not repayment enough ?
that is for him to decide .
you are a free man .
your decisions your own .
as it was when you stood in the arena .
to strike down your brothers .
what moved your hand ?
honor , as you have it ?
or the promise of coin ?
never to be collected .
because i chose not to kill you in the arena .
and now my rudis , my freedom ,
is forever buried beneath its rubble .
freedom is not a stick of wood ,
to be presented as a bone to obedient dog .
it is a thing all men deserve .
we are gladiators .
deserving only death equal
to the lives of we have taken .
it was not always so for me .
i lived free once , in the lands of thrace .
with a wife , promise of children ...
what became of her ?
batiatus claimed her life .
i took his in return .
then you have balanced scale .
it was glaber who condemned us to slavery .
and i will not rest while he yet draws breath .
this is the reason you provoke the romans ?
for the memory of your woman ?
for love .
the greatest cause of all .
one that has dragged many a man to his ruin .
you have scared away the game .
i would fare better alone .
keep fucking sword up !
let it drop , and fall forever beside it !
again !
i would not have you expire from the heat .
gratitude .
i would also not have you at agron &apos;s throat .
if he had his way ,
he would have left you in the mines .
perhaps he was right .
do not say such a thing .
you have not thought the same , after last night ?
if such a thought threatened ,
i would rip it from fucking brain with bare hands .
all that matters is the woman i love
stands before me once again .
does she ?
or is it but faint spirit ,
haunting the memory of her body ?
you have lost mind .
hundreds dead .
an arena destroyed .
and this is what you offer ?
lucretia to prostrate herself in the market ,
begging the gods to piss out the flames that yet smolder ?
apologies , young seppius is but moved by passionate heart .
i &apos;m sure the gods take notice , of his lack of faith .
we must humble ourselves before the gods ,
in attempt to regain their favor .
ritual will do much to ease the people &apos;s fears .
better assuaged by the capture of spartacus .
my men sweep the countryside ,
taking action in favor of prayer .
as they have for many months , to no result .
yours have fared no better .
true . the only one who benefits
from our divide is the man who causes us injury .
and most keenly felt .
your father &apos;s guidance and even hand is deeply missed .
his absence from this world has set it upon end .
seppia fell to similar heart ,
when our cousin sextus was
snatched from life by spartacus .
and she relives the moment in mercato &apos;s passing .
a family friend since she was yet a child .
too many have been lost .
i would see no more of note to follow .
let us set difference aside ,
join our men in common force .
one , which will overwhelm spartacus and his murdering horde .
yes , for the good of the people !
the city will praise you both ,
our voices carrying to the very steps of the senate .
i would need to consult with varinius .
the very same man who galloped back to rome
while the stones of the arena were yet falling ?
varinius moves to distance himself
from all that has happened here .
including you .
take my hand ,
and with it see more lasting bond forged .
i will consider your proposal .
to give answer tomorrow .
a night &apos;s rest , ...
loving sister may sway a brother , where others fail .
... mind to be certainly cleared by morning .
seppius ,
i would extend invitation to your sister .
in hopes that we may find greater strength
in the beating of two wounded hearts .
a thoughtful offer .
there is no deeper solace for a woman ,
than in the bosom of her gender .
it would come as great comfort .
gratitude .
i will arrange visit .
your wife speaks with swift thought .
seppia will take words to heart on the matter ,
with seppius to find them better received from her lips .
yes .
your invitation may yet prove to be welcomed aid .
come . i would discuss other matters with you .
did i not tell you ?
together we will see ourselves freed from this abyss .
i do not see the man .
you are certain he lives ?
there were four others held with him at the bottom .
he did not care for the company .
their memory is carved into his flesh ,
joining the marks of the other souls that he has taken .
what is it you seek of such a beast ?
what i seek of the egyptian is none of your concern .
i come under the authority of praetor gaius claudius glaber .
a noble title .
yet absent the man himself ,
i cannot break my charge .
of course .
if you do not mind waiting here with my men ,
until i return with him ... ?
well the day has been long and hot .
i would have shade , and wine ...
to cool overheating concerns .
let us see you into the light , my friend .
and set hands to purpose ...
you must keep your left arm steady ,
pull through to the cheek , take breath , and release .
make attempt .
pull through to cheek ...
deep breath ...
and release .
do not jerk from the string .
but let it gently slip from your fingers .
with practice , you will be as the goddess diana ,
striking enemies from afar .
donar !
i would accompany you .
i hold no interest in the bow .
we lay together once and you expect us to never be parted ?
you mistake me for a fucking gaul .
you seek donar &apos;s affection now ?
i seek only my place in this world .
then seize it with your own hands .
not by the spreading of your legs .
in two weeks time , a ship will dock here .
its hold laden with fighting men captured by the romans .
if a few of us dressed as merchants
could gain entry , before they &apos;re unloaded ...
such a thing is possible .
your labors have born fruit .
not all as sweet .
news carries through the streets .
glaber has raised the bounty on your head to 9000 denarii .
it seems you have caught nothing but rome &apos;s attention .
you will find that a sour meal .
were the gauls not fucking bad enough ?
i have heard many tales of the undefeated gaul .
a fine title .
yet i recall you absent victory
when we faced solonius &apos; men in the opening of the arena .
true .
i was not awarded victory .
yet i did not suffer defeat in proper challenge .
perhaps we will yet have one .
perhaps .
it warms heart to know that you were champion .
show how much you desired it .
yet it comes as a surprise , to see you here .
following a thracian &apos;s lead .
spartacus has opened my eyes .
we stand together .
then why do you now sit ,
while he and the lumbering oaf make plans that affect all ?
i am taken by other concerns .
naevia is your woman now ?
i remember her , when she was yet a flower untouched .
what led her to be so rudely handled ?
my affections .
and discovery of them by lucretia .
the heaviest price is always paid by those we love .
you should carry her far from spartacus
and his foolish cause .
before he drags you all to your end .
oenomaus awakes .
i am here only for words .
which do you think could ever hold meaning now ?
that melitta chose you .
that your heart was cherished above all others .
then why was she with you the night she died ?
to share a final drink before i was to be sold to tullius .
the only reason ?
whatever happened between us , i am to blame .
not her .
never her .
i loved you as a brother .
and i you .
no .
you are a man that stands only for himself .
and would betray the gods
to gain what he desires .
perhaps i was a fool .
to have ever believed otherwise .
i see it every time i close my eyes .
spartacus , hurling his spear .
cossutius &apos; final gasping breath ...
and mercato ...
poor mercato ...
he will be sorely missed .
apologies .
i babble on as if i am the only one that has suffered loss ,
and you grieve a father &apos;s passing .
the heart is overwhelmed by his absence .
you shall embrace him again .
as i shall mercato ,
and beloved cousin sextus .
upon the shores of the afterlife .
where my husband quintus patiently awaits .
and with him countless other romans of note .
all snatched from this life too soon , by common foe .
the years between you far outweigh mine .
yet do not think me naive .
you extend invitation not to counsel grief ,
but to maneuver me to sway my brother &apos;s position .
seppia --
he &apos;s been clear in his desire that he ,
and he alone will bring our common foe to justice .
and his passions when set are not easily moved .
you have uncovered the veiled schemes of two old women .
but know attempt springs from wounded heart .
one shared between us all , regardless of age or experience .
i looked into his eyes , when spartacus stood down upon the sands .
they burned with a fire that would consume the world .
and it shall .
if good men fail to set quarrel aside ,
and face spartacus as one .
as i have said to your wife ,
my brother can be most difficult .
faults is not his alone .
i regret not having taken different path towards more agreeable solution .
but know that i place foot firmly upon it now .
i will have words .
and attempt to set him upon it beside you .
most welcomed news , is it not , gaius ?
yes , most welcomed .
you are a ray of light , in a house mired in shadow .
ah , forgive me .
pressing matters call my attention .
you &apos;re blessed , to hold such a man .
the gods grant only what is deserved .
the men required have been assembled .
come then .
i would see if they are all that you &apos;ve promised .
gannicus &apos; bounty is being prepared .
come , let us take food .
you have honed it to fine edge .
life would easily run from veins ,
if brought to bear upon flesh .
naevia ...
that is a name that holds no meaning .
she was a different girl ,
young and foolish .
ripped from this world by rough hands
and hot breath upon neck .
the things she was forced to do to survive ...
we will go from this place .
find a new life on distant shores .
beyond the shadow of rome .
there is no place that memory would not follow .
i cannot run from this .
what would you have me do ?
stand idle , and watch as you fade ?
no . i would not have you watch .
i would have you teach .
how to breathe again .
how to live .
how to fight .
so that no man will ever lay hands on me against my will .
and the girl who &apos;s name was robbed may reclaim it .
we will have vengeance for what the romans have done .
together we shall see them drown in rivers of blood .
nothing !
nor here !
calm yourselves !
what moves to such fits ?
our remaining coin is missing .
fuck the coin .
the map is gone .
our position , plans towards neapolis ...
someone seeks to betray us , for promise of glaber &apos;s reward .
spartacus ...
gannicus .
you leave without words ?
i have had them with oenomaus .
what do you carry with you ?
water .
meat , caught by my own fucking hands .
our map takes flight in your wake .
a thing i have seen your gaze upon .
i am guilty of many things .
betraying ill @-@ fated cause does not stand among them .
remove yourself from fucking path .
i knew eventually you would lead these men to their deaths eventually .
is this the day you would do it ?
they are but loyal .
a quality you seem unfamiliar with .
no !
do not come between us !
i would show him what a man with cause is capable of .
your sword .
you fight in the style of dimachaerus .
trained by oenomaus himself .
let me pass .
or put skill to final test .
we must stop this .
spartacus has made desire known .
we shall honor it .
spartacus !
chadara !
she was trying to slip away .
when all others stood fixed .
a fine shot .
i meant only to wound .
she took the map .
why would she do such a thing ?
she felt she had no place among us .
she sought to secure one elsewhere .
apologies .
your words prove true .
it has not always been so .
i would take to path now ,
unless you would seek further quarrel .
go .
enough blood has spilled .
do you stay ?
we do .
then i shall mourn your passing .
is it wise to let him go ?
every man has a right to his own choice .
gannicus has made his .
and may yet prove a threat .
we have faced far worse .
the egyptian and your men prove themselves .
as promised .
see the bodies of the slaves properly attended .
draw no attention .
apologies .
i could not wait until morning .
you wish to give voice to my offer ?
i fear it comes too late .
s @-@ s @-@ seppia ...
i &apos;ve seen how close you hold her to heart .
leave this life knowing she &apos;s safe .
beneath my roof .
my hands to comfort her in days to come .
words no longer hold meaning .
and i &apos;ve had too many of them ,
by fools presuming themselves to be my better .
such days are at an end .
your men are now mine .
and with their addition to my own ,
clear path to the end of spartacus .
