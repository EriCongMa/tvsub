i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
love brought me to mystic falls ,
love drove me away .
i love you , damon .
silas .
hello , my shadow self .
and even though we &apos;ve lost almost everything ...
bonnie &apos;s dead , elena .
i--i have no idea who you people are .
there are people at this school watching you and your friends
drop out and move back to mystic falls .
our hope is not lost .
silas &apos; whole bad guy plan was to kill himself
and reunite with his dead girlfriend amara .
i want to use his death
to bring bonnie back to life .
silas was my true love .
i never said that i was his .
he wanted to be with amara .
silas needs every last drop of your blood
to cure himself , katherine .
no .
no , damon . i don &apos;t want to die .
am i in hell ?
sure a little thing like you can eat all that ?
i &apos;m celebrating .
i thought i was gonna die .
i didn &apos;t .
so now i &apos;m free to be
whatever i want to be .
it &apos;s a good day .
love the hair , by the way .
bold choice .
this is nice .
it is nice .
quiet , still , peaceful .
i like our life when it &apos;s like this .
but it is our life ,
which probably means that somebody &apos;s
gonna walk through that door and shatter it .
oh , don &apos;t say that .
in 10 , 9 ...
just let me enjoy the moment .
6 , 5 ...
damon , today is the day that we &apos;re gonna bring bonnie back .
it &apos;s a good day .
3 ... 2 ...
damon , it &apos;s a good day .
greetings
one .
good morning , frenemies .
ah . you know , i &apos;m only a few hours into my old life as a witch ,
but somehow , the sun feels warmer .
probably because i &apos;m not cursed with having to outlive it any more .
what &apos;s with the home invasion , silas ?
well , damon , after 2,000 years of a miserable existence ,
i finally get to die .
morning , sleepyhead .
sleep well ?
oh . tessa . hi .
you &apos;re confused .
is that the amnesia or the tequila ?
um , i think both .
i &apos;m still trying to piece together last night .
we bonded over our misery .
there were body shots .
the misery lifted .
here . berries .
thank you . what &apos;s got you in such a good mood ?
i happened to see a text message pop up on your phone
after you crashed last night .
warning from your friends .
silas took the cure . he &apos;s a witch .
he &apos;s mortal , and now i can kill him .
get up , gorgeous .
your doppelganger dies today .
we all know that tessa as a real vengeful bitch .
your doppelganger amara died at her hands ,
but today after 2,000 years ,
amara and i will finally reunite .
all right . skip the mushy parts .
look . my girl here is just trying to have a good day ,
and there are promises she &apos;s expecting you to keep .
oh . you don &apos;t think that i keep my promises ?
you said that now you &apos;re a witch again
you would bring bonnie back from the other side .
i did , and i can .
and you promised damon that you would do that
if he helped you .
yeah .
but you &apos;re kind of evil . no offense .
none taken .
so i &apos;m just trying to figure out
how i can trust
that one of your last acts in this world
will be to bring my best friend back .
did you want me to pinky swear ?
she &apos;s trying to have a good day .
just tell her how it &apos;s gonna go down .
i just want to destroy the other side
so i don &apos;t get stuck in that pit of a purgatory
when i finally do kill myself .
before i do that , i &apos;ll bring bonnie back ,
and being the amazing and incredible
and all @-@ powerful witch that i am ,
i can totally do both things .
i just have to find the anchor first and destroy it .
the anchor ?
silas is looking for the anchor .
it &apos;s the object i used to bind the spell
when i created the other side .
destroy it , the spell &apos;s broken .
no more supernatural limbo ,
and silas can die and find peace .
i &apos;d rather his lying , cheating ass not have that .
great , fine . i approve .
where is it ?
new jersey ?
the supernatural other world is bound
by an object in snooki &apos;s backyard ?
it &apos;s in a stocyard , and it &apos;s being shipped out ,
so we really need to--hello , hunter .
banner day for you , huh ?
didn &apos;t you and the bennett witch used to--tch , tch .
hey . knock it off , ok ?
it &apos;s ok , jer . we all want the same thing today--
silas dead , bonnie alive .
yeah
aka , put the damn crossbow down , pocahontas .
we &apos;re just supposed to believe that he &apos;s gonna
bring bonnie back to life out of the goodness of his heart ?
well , i hope not .
i mean , i am kind of a monster .
you know , guys , i &apos;m feeling really ganged up on right now , ok ?
i would hate to lose my temper and do something ...
crazy .
ahh . man , i really love being a witch again .
i feel like i &apos;m constantly reinventing myself .
i &apos;m like a supernatural madonna ,
don &apos;t you think ?
so silas read your mind and figured out where the anchor is ?
now what ?
you now that old , ancient story
i told you about the travelers ?
oh , wait . you don &apos;t .
i fried your brain and took your memories . sorry .
the travelers-- you know how silas wants to destroy the other side
so he can be at peace with that slut amara
that he calls his one true love ?
the travelers don &apos;t want that .
why not ?
not important .
scratch that . very important .
i &apos;m just not gonna answer it .
um , you know what ?
i think i still need to be drunk to understand this story .
the travelers have been in possession of the anchor for 2,000 years .
they constantly move it so it doesn &apos;t fall into the wrong hands ,
and they &apos;re not gonna let him get near it ,
at least not before i kill him .
yeah ? well , what if they fail ?
he won &apos;t destroy it .
he won &apos;t be able to .
why not ?
let &apos;s just file that under the not gonna answer it category .
all right . we got to get going .
you grab a crowbar or 4 from the garage .
what for ?
does it matter ?
you , you &apos;re not going .
men only .
are you serious ? he &apos;s not serious .
no , he &apos;s not serious .
actually , i am 100 % serious .
she &apos;s a freaky carbon copy of my one true love amara .
you can understand why i don &apos;t want to
stare at her imposter face all day .
that makes no sense .
if would make complete sense if you were ever in love with anybody
who looked exactly like her .
this is ridiculous .
we &apos;re bringing my best friend back from the dead .
i &apos;m going .
next one goes in the heart .
now hurry up . i only have until sundown
before tessa tries to stop me .
well , the one good thing about having amnesia
is that i don &apos;t remember how i got in the middle of all this .
rest easy , sweet pea .
don &apos;t you worry about the details .
silas is going to die today ,
and he will spend eternity
on the other side as far away from amara
and peace as possible .
i have it all covered .
you don &apos;t scheme as long as i have
without considering every possibility .
what &apos;s wrong ?
silas put a spell on this cabin .
we &apos;re stuck here until sundown .
how do you know that ?
because i taught him the damn spell .
i don &apos;t want to know if tyler called ,
so don &apos;t even tell me .
do you want to do small appliances or toiletries ?
i &apos;d compel a cute boy to pack for us ,
but i don &apos;t think i want to see a cute boy ever again
except for jesse , who is conveniently not answering his phone .
um , we &apos;re moving out ?
hello ! dr. maxfield thinks we &apos;re vampires ,
you know , threatened to expose us ,
told us to drop out .
that sucks .
what the hell are you doing in my dorm , katherine ?
i just need a place to crash .
what ? i loathe you .
i &apos;m desperate , ok ?
damon kicked me out , stefan doesn &apos;t remember me ,
and i just spent my last $ 20 on a meal
that i didn &apos;t even get to enjoy .
aw . and how is any of this my problem ?
look at you .
moving out , giving up ?
that &apos;s very un @-@ caroline of you .
you need me bad .
in exchange for a place to stay
and elena &apos;s meal card ,
i will help you deal with dr. whoever .
dr. maxfield . he teaches bio .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
you &apos;re scared of a teacher ?
aw , honey , you really need to take a crash course on villain 101,
but luckily for you ,
i have an honorary doctorate .
what do you say , roomie ?
stefan &apos;s phone .
who &apos;s this ?
uncanny .
your doppelganger voice is exactly like amara &apos;s ,
so whiny .
tessa , where &apos;s stefan ?
he &apos;s here . well , not here here .
he hopped in the shower .
between us girls , he works up quite the sweat ,
but i guess you know that .
may i leave him a message ?
yeah . remind him that you &apos;re a crazy bitch .
i would , but i think that &apos;s maybe his type .
he &apos;s with tessa .
why does he keep going back to her ?
look . who knows ? amnesia stef &apos;s a fickle little fellow .
wait . you didn &apos;t tell elena
what we you did to stefan ?
tell me what ?
silas needed his psychic juju to get into tessa &apos;s head ,
and the only way to temporarily reactivate his ability
was to break stefan &apos;s neck
a couple times .
as if he didn &apos;t hate us enough .
damon , oh , god . i &apos;m going over there .
she should really .
tessa &apos;s bad business .
no . just let stefan have his space .
it &apos;s like you said , he &apos;s already mad enough .
sounds like he &apos;s more mad at you .
maybe he and i can find some common ground .
knock , knock .
knock , knock . who &apos;s there ?
the mayor . the mayor who ?
well , who ?
no one . that &apos;s the joke .
no one &apos;s there because i killed the mayor .
you &apos;re a dick .
subject 62547 .
blood film analysis .
cellular growth rate is phenomenal .
as expected ...
what are you doing here ?
well , if it isn &apos;t stefan &apos;s fated love .
where is he ?
come on in .
who am i to stand in the way of destiny ?
elena .
you shouldn &apos;t have walked through that door .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i wouldn &apos;t have let damon do what he did to you .
sure you would have .
you have this annoying tendency
to do anything he tells you to do .
i &apos;m no shrink , but i think it &apos;s called codependence .
look . i get that you &apos;re upset with us
for pretty much everything ,
but do you really think that sleeping with tessa
is gonna solve veything ?
who said i was sleeping with tessa ?
i am so bad with messages .
oh , look ! elena called .
she &apos;s wondering why you &apos;re here .
i may have embellished for effect .
ok . i just came by to make sure that
she hadn &apos;t done some , like , &quot; fatal attraction &quot; spell on you ,
but now that i know that you &apos;re good ,
i &apos;m gonna go .
yeah . you really shouldn &apos;t have come inside .
thank god .
how do you do it , damon ?
how you can stand being here
while your girlfriend sits at home
worrying about her doppelganger soul mate ?
it &apos;s called being secure .
i &apos;m assuming you know a little bit about that
by the way you wear your hair .
please don &apos;t tell me you believe in
this doppelganger prophecy crap .
crap ? what do you mean crap ?
do you not notice the universe trying to mirror my love
for amara by bringing our doppelgangers together ?
you do realize that by destroying the other side
that you are personally moving heaven and earth to be together ?
that &apos;s not fate , you idiot .
it &apos;s you being a crazy person .
ok . where is this stupid anchor thing ?
i have no idea .
what do you mean you have no idea ?
give me some credit , man .
i did psychically dive into tessa &apos;s mind
to see this specific warehouse .
what does it look like ?
again , i have no idea .
tessa created it after she locked me away
in a tomb for 2,000 years and left me to starve .
remember ? remote island , creepy hallucinations ?
wait . you don &apos;t know where it is
or what it looks like ?
it binds a spell to a supernatural hell dimension .
it &apos;s not gonna look like a freaking ikea sink .
what did you inject him with ?
i don &apos;t know . it just said avoid contact with eyes
and do not ingest .
oops .
that &apos;s etorphine .
there you go .
what are you doing , elena ?
we &apos;re draining the vervained blood out of your system
so i can compel you to forget that elena and i are vampires .
wait . what ? you &apos;ll kill me !
shh . i &apos;m just--i &apos;m trying to do some math . ok .
so if the average male has 5 liters of blood in his system ...
that &apos;s about right .
then carry the one ....
just round up .
perfect ! 4.7 pints .
should i use the right arm of the left arm ?
untie me . i &apos;ll find the vein myself .
you will kill me .
give me . it &apos;s not my first rodeo .
can you give me one of those tubing thingies
and , um , some tape ?
oh , my god . it &apos;s totally working .
ta @-@ da .
so ...
doctor ...
you tell me ...
who else knows about us ?
if you were willing to kill me ,
you wouldn &apos;t have gone through all this trouble .
you should have left when i told you to .
they &apos;re on to you .
who &apos;s they ?
the people you want to expose us to ,
that secret society thingie that you belong to ?
there &apos;s a gathering today at whitmore house .
the society &apos;s using it to suss out potential candidates .
they were going to invite you
until they started suspecting you were a vampire .
so all i have to do is convince them
that elena gilbert isn &apos;t a vampire ?
done .
they &apos;ll never let you in ,
and a vampire can never get past the threshold .
what did that crate do to you ?
bonnie , what are you doing here ?
didn &apos;t want to miss the excitement .
it &apos;s not every day a girl comes back from the dead .
don &apos;t jinx it .
i &apos;m not jinxing it .
i &apos;m being realistic .
it &apos;s not a dime store spell , jer .
when i brought you back , it killed me , remember ?
what i meant was it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s not something i &apos;m gonna count on , ok ?
not ok .
have some faith .
if you believe that it can work
and i believe it can work ,
then it will work .
just say it . you need to say it .
it will work .
thank you .
jer , just so we &apos;re clear ,
i would die 100 times over
just to have you standing here alive in front of me .
before today is over ...
we &apos;re gonna know what ... that ...
feels like .
quit dawdling .
we have to find this thing before the travelers show up .
why are they so interested in this anchor ?
they hate me for creating the immortality spell .
and they know the anchor &apos;s the only thing
standing in between me and my soul mate .
and every love story needs that one thing
that just keeps getting in the way .
kind of like you , damon .
you know , you might be an all @-@ powerful witch--
is that what you called it ?
yeah .
but i will happily kill you if you keep that up .
oh , no , you won &apos;t ,
not until i bring your girlfriend &apos;s bestie back .
well , isn &apos;t this a pleasant surprise ?
you ain &apos;t seen nothing yet .
since i &apos;m occupied at the moment ,
i need you to go ahead and kill silas for me .
gladly , but he &apos;s such a control freak
that he wants to off himself himself .
you mean , after he destroys the other side ?
yeah . that &apos;s not gonna happen ,
plus i want him dead before he has the pleasure of finding the anchor .
yeah . i &apos;m not following .
kill him now .
damon !
did i mention i lured your girlfriend here to me .
i used the oldest trick in the book .
jealousy of stefan !
thought you should know .
tessa !
stop . stop it !
i can &apos;t kill him yet . he has to do something for me first .
is that something more important than elena ?
because silas put a spell on this house
and bound it to the sun ,
which means we &apos;re trapped here until sundown ,
which means you have until then to kill silas .
or i kill elena .
with a face like amara &apos;s ,
it might be cathartic . bye now .
whoa . wait !
miss gilbert .
you know me ?
i &apos;m diane freeman .
we met the night your roommate died .
of course . crazy night .
anyway , i am here for the shindig .
i didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d be joining us .
did i forget to rsvp ?
oh , sorry .
i &apos;ve just been so busy with my studies .
we just started the tea .
got any food ?
what ?
are you the sandwich police ?
just trying to figure out why wes told me to stay away from you .
do i know you ?
aaron . we met yesterday .
you changed your hair . it &apos;s ...
aaron . duh . hi .
so what are you doing here ?
are you part of ... the secret society ?
the what ?
you know ...
the society .
i still have no idea .
either you &apos;re genuinely clueless ,
or you &apos;re very good at keeping secrets .
is that your tooth ?
no .
what is happening to me ?
look at all the incredible things they &apos;ve dreamt up to do with food .
pineapple on pizza ?
so sad . let me guess . gluten @-@ free ?
how did you get here ?
excuse me ?
here , alive , from the other side .
how did you come back to life ?
oh , yeah . that .
you can blame your friend bonnie for that .
she opened the door and then distracted herself
when she brought your little brother back to life ,
so i just walked right through when she died .
well , today , silas was gonna bring her back to life
after he got the anchor .
but you told my boyfriend ,
who has never put anyone &apos;s life before mine ,
including his own , to kill silas
before he could do that .
so , no , i &apos;m not sad about the pizza .
look . why don &apos;t we forget about the pizza ?
what do you say i make something ?
ok .
roasted duck .
wait . do you have a duck ?
no , but maybe i can lure one inside .
got elena in .
how much smarter could a duck be ?
go for it .
all right . ha ha !
we can &apos;t kill silas .
silas is the only one that can bring bonnie back .
and he &apos;s not gonna bring her back
until right before he destroys the other side .
yeah ? well , tessa wants to do it now .
something tells me patience isn &apos;t her strong suit .
damon , you promised .
you promised elena that she would see bonnie again .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m aware of that ?
but if tessa kills elena ,
guess who &apos;s not gonna make it to bonnie &apos;s welcome home party .
plan &apos;s off , jeremy .
bonnie &apos;s not coming back . sorry .
it &apos;s ok , jeremy .
bonnie ...
she &apos;s my sister .
jeremy gilbert , do you not know me at all ?
is there a part of you that thinks for one minute
that i &apos;d let one of my friends die
just so i could come back to life ?
i &apos;m dead , jer ,
and as much as i want to come back ,
maybe i &apos;m just supposed to accept it .
we were so close .
i know we were .
go help him kill silas .
sul opreem chele kouzlo .
i &apos;ve met a lot of witches in my day .
never quite heard that one before .
let me guess . travelers .
sul opreem chele kouzlo .
sul opreem chele kouzlo .
sul opreem chele kouzlo .
sul opreem chele kouzlo .
sul opreem chele kouzlo .
sul opreem chele kouzlo .
sul opreem chele kouzlo .
why do you witches always go for the daylight ring ?
i was about to do your little eurotribe a favor .
i want to kill silas , too .
that &apos;s the problem .
we don &apos;t want him dead yet .
well , that &apos;s not gonna work for me .
you &apos;re oddly calm ,
which only adds to my complete and utter terror .
sorry . i spaced .
you spaced ?
caroline , i would have bled to death .
you know what ?
i just broke up with my boyfriend for good .
my heart is in pieces .
sue me for having a moment .
my apologies . is the moment over ?
yes , it is .
now answer my questions truthfully .
what is the secret society ?
it &apos;s called augustine .
augustine ?
i &apos;ve never heard of it .
that &apos;s the whole point .
and how do you become a member ?
most recruits are legacies ,
but some of us were chosen for our extraordinary talents .
and what is your extraordinary talent ?
being brilliant .
not to mention that you &apos;re willing to lie on autopsy reports
like my roommate &apos;s .
you knew that she was killed by a vampire .
is that why you covered up her death ?
no . i covered up her death
because it wasn &apos;t just any vampire .
it was the augustine vampire .
hang on . ok . so your creepy elitist society
also has their own vampire ?
who is it ?
wes , you in there ?
it &apos;s diane freeman .
you were wrong . elena gilbert and i aren &apos;t vampires .
we &apos;re just regular freshmen .
you &apos;re light @-@ headed because you gave blood this morning .
forget everything that happened here .
wes ?
so you are here .
of course i &apos;m here . why ?
because it &apos;s 5 : 00 .
you missed the whitmore party .
what ?
i was working .
the day must have gotten away from me .
that &apos;s not all you missed .
guess who i watched strut right through the front door .
elena gilbert . clearly not a vampire .
what made you so convinced she was ?
i ...
have no idea .
i guess i was wrong .
try this and let me know what you think .
all right .
mmm . it &apos;s good .
yeah ?
yeah .
all right .
ok . i get it .
you hate me .
you may not have any memories , stefan ,
but i do .
this person , she &apos;s not the type of person that you would like .
that &apos;s not very nice ,
especially considering i &apos;ve allowed you
to remain alive until sundown .
oh . almost sundown .
elena , don &apos;t say a word .
i got this .
i know you think that i hate you , but i don &apos;t .
i won &apos;t let her hurt you , i promise .
why isn &apos;t he picking up for--
what ?
is he dead yet ?
there you are . man up .
we &apos;re under attack .
no . he &apos;s not dead yet .
i was just ambushed by some of your inbred cousins .
any idea why travelers who hate silas
would want to stop me from killing him ?
they probably want his blood .
for what ?
silas drank the cure from katherine .
now his blood is the cure .
but they &apos;re not immortal ,
so who do they want it for ?
think about it , damon .
the travelers aren &apos;t fans of immortality ,
and i had to bind the other side to something ,
something that would last forever ,
something that silas couldn &apos;t destroy .
what , his favorite childhood sled ?
something a little closer to his heart .
2,000 years old , immortal ,
indestructible .
you &apos;re a quick boy , damon .
figure it out .
elena , run !
no way .
what ?
not possible .
what ?
tessa may be insane , but she &apos;s a bona fide genius .
2,000 years old , immortal , indestructible .
the anchor isn &apos;t a thing .
it &apos;s a person .
amara .
she never killed amara .
you &apos;re still alive .
amara ...
it &apos;s me .
you &apos;re ok .
go away .
go away . leave me alone .
no , no , no . it &apos;s ok .
who are you talking to , huh ?
it &apos;s me , it &apos;s me .
silas .
it &apos;s me .
how is it possible ?
how are you here ?
after all this time ...
i thought you were dead .
tessa said she killed you .
she held your heart in her hands .
she lied . she couldn &apos;t kill me .
there was only one cure .
she wanted it for you .
i took it . i &apos;m sorry .
i wanted to be with you .
i wanted to be at peace with you .
the cure runs in your veins .
i was ready to die for you .
i love you , silas .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i have to be cured .
i can &apos;t live another day .
elena gilbert , what brings you by ?
how &apos;d you get this ?
mystery .
i listened to about half
before i nearly blew my brains out from boredom
except for the part about your subject &apos;s blood being abnormal .
that part was mildly interesting .
well , thanks for returning it .
now that subject , 62547 , right ,
is that the augustine vampire ?
i think you should go .
heh . and do what ,
sprinkle all of your dirty little secrets across campus ,
like augustine
and all the vampire experiments that you &apos;ve been doing ?
come on , dr. wes .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be some sort of genius ?
i &apos;m sure we can come up with some
creative solution for our little predicament .
i have to say
if i wasn &apos;t such a genius ,
i might actually think you were blackmailing me , elena .
actually , my name &apos;s katherine .
elena &apos;s my doppelganger ,
and while i let you chew on that ...
i &apos;ll admit there is something
that i can &apos;t solve on my own .
is that a tooth ?
it &apos;s my tooth .
i think i &apos;m dying , and i need you to save my life .
stop talking .
it &apos;s not up to you .
leave me alone !
leave me alone !
leave me alone ! leave me alone !
leave me alone !
please leave me alone .
leave me alone .
are you real ?
are you ?
well , uh , have a good night .
it &apos;s weird .
even with no memory , you &apos;re ... still you .
well , tessa was gonna kill you ,
and you don &apos;t seem like you deserve that ,
so i was just going on instinct , that &apos;s all .
exactly . that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
your instincts were always to protect me ,
so thank you for--
for just being you .
well , have a good night .
stefan salvatore sleeps in his own bed tonight .
does that mean he stopped hating us ,
or did the power of the fated doppelganger universe
push him into the car with you ?
well , he , uh , saved my life ,
so i &apos;ll take that as not hate .
victory in a day otherwise marred by failure .
we couldn &apos;t get bonnie back .
i get a pass .
did i say anything ?
tell her it &apos;s for the best , jer .
no . no , i won &apos;t because it &apos;s not .
what ?
bonnie &apos;s here .
she wants us not to worry .
we &apos;re gonna keep trying , bonnie , ok ?
it &apos;s not over .
we &apos;ve dealt with much worse .
well , silas is m.i.a. and out and about ,
which is pretty bad ,
and amara &apos;s been cured ,
which is even worse
because now she &apos;s easy to kill ,
so the fate of the other side , where bonnie currently resides ,
rests on a living , breathing human being that we now need to protect .
we need to protect ?
elena , meet crazy pants .
crazy pants , meet elena .
what are you doing here ?
do you have any idea what it &apos;s like
watching history repeat itself ?
you &apos;re hurt . i can heal you .
no , no . i want this wound .
it &apos;s a reminder of what you really are .
see , memories are important .
i made a mistake when i found you .
i eased your pain .
you used to have a lot of pain .
remember ?
you killed your own father ...
and then forced your brother to become a vampire .
and now i can &apos;t fight it .
and that was just the start of your reign of terror .
you hated yourself for a century ,
but then you found her .
i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
didn &apos;t last very long , did it ?
stop it . stop it , please .
but the ending &apos;s the best part
because you actually felt real pain ,
physical pain , torture .
remember ?
hello , my shadow self .
you were trapped in a safe
and tossed in a quarry .
water flooded in .
you tried to scream , you tried to escape ,
but all you could do was drown over and over and over again .
the only thing keeping you sane
was that one day one of the two people you loved ...
would come rescue you , but they didn &apos;t .
i did .
