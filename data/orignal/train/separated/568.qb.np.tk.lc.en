city college has a space simulator .
we know . close the door .
as i was saying ...
on monday , city college will be unveiling ,
the city college cosmic pioneer--
their very own orbital launch simulator .
pretty soon ,
they will have an astronaut on their brochure ,
and we will still be bragging about our foosball table .
what do you think happens to enrollment then ?
i don &apos;t know about you , gentlemen ,
but i love my campus , and i don &apos;t want to watch it
become a city college parking lot .
well , what can we do ?
we can launch our own space simulator .
before they simulate their launch on monday ,
we simulate a launch this weekend .
we make greendale , not city college ,
the first community college to pretend to put a man in space .
do we even have a simulator ?
we can get one .
in 1980 , the county museum
had a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art space mission simulator
sponsored by kentucky fried chicken
called the kentucky fried chicken eleven herbs &amp; space experience .
gentlemen ...
greendale &apos;s future !
actually , that photo &apos;s from the past .
here &apos;s one more current .
it &apos;s seen better days .
i admit ... it could use a good wash .
and i &apos;ve got just the crew to wash it .
can we stop walking in slo @-@ mo now ?
20 more yards .
you guys are walking in slo @-@ mo ?
第二季第四集
you guys are an hour late !
abed kept making us redo our walk .
i think you know the reason
this group has been chosen for this job--
to atone ...
for the obscene entry you submitted
in the greendale school @-@ flag contest .
that &apos;s right--i know that this isn &apos;t a symbol
&#91; 西语 &quot; 合而为一 &quot; 的变体 &#93;
for the crossroads of ideas .
i now know it &apos;s a butt .
yeah , keep snickering .
pack yourselves with peanuts and really be satisfied .
but guess what ?
this won .
this is now our school flag forever .
proud of yourselves ?
how do you know it was our design ?
we submitted it anonymously .
whoops .
one of you actually came forward .
what ?
now , somewhere beneath this dirt
is greendale &apos;s newest pride .
and my hope is that while you scrub it ,
you will find the school pride in your hearts .
after we clean it , can we go inside ?
no . that is a job for some upstanding students
who are training right now in the simulator simulator .
great job on this .
hard to believe i &apos;m not really not really in space .
i expect this craft to be squeaky clean
in time for the pretend launch
in front of the press at 3 : 00 .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to make this into a butt flag .
man , i remember this thing from high school during field trips ,
we used to sneak inside and get ...
to praying .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
we should take a coffee break .
let &apos;s all get coffee , okay ?
where are troy and abed ?
i &apos;m pretty sure they made their way into that thing
five seconds after the dean left .
what ?
hmm . it &apos;s more beautiful than i ever imagined .
you &apos;ve never been in it ?
my dad never let me .
he always had grudge against fast @-@ food restaurants .
they almost wiped out his falafel stand .
but i memorized every detail of this old girl on the internet .
guys , we can &apos;t be in here .
then get out .
wow , it &apos;s pretty well preserved
for something that survived the &apos; 80s ...
and apparently a local transient
who liked to collect doll heads .
the &apos; 80s .
our teen years , right , everybody ?
i feel like i &apos;m underdressed for this .
i &apos;m gonna get something from the dorm .
guys , seriously ,
i have to ask that we all step out of here .
or what , you &apos;re gonna tattle on us
like you did with the flag ?
i didn &apos;t tattle about the flag ,
but you shouldn &apos;t have made it in the first place .
if you love greendale so much , why don &apos;t you marry it ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m a little claustrophobic , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s no big deal , as long as i &apos;m standing near a door .
in close situations , i get a little nuts ,
and i don &apos;t know , you know , what &apos;s--
no , no , no !
no !
hello ?
greetings .
i am systematic android network
diode energy rocket system .
but you may call me &quot; sanders . &quot;
sanders . sanders , this is pierce hawthorne .
can i get this door open , please ?
hey , look for the handle .
there &apos;s got to be a handle on the door .
you don &apos;t know that . it was the &apos; 80s .
everybody who made this was on cocaine .
we can &apos;t be in here .
just as kentucky fried chicken &apos;s
secret process seals in the flavor ,
i &apos;m sealing the cabin &apos;s air
so you don &apos;t explode on your journey .
what ?
what does that mean ?
please find a seat , strap yourself in ,
and wait for mission control .
okay , we got to find a handle on this door !
guys , guys , can we just take a mental step backwards
and realize we are simply in a winnebago
and we &apos;ll be fine .
oh , god !
please find a seat , strap yourself in ,
and wait for mission control .
i &apos;m not strapping myself into a coffin .
we got to get out of here !
i hope you found a seat .
i want you to be safe .
did you just threaten me ?
pierce , you &apos;re talking to an atari cartridge .
sit down !
this is part of the simulation , right ?
i don &apos;t think this is a simulation .
i think we &apos;re being towed .
come on !
hello ?
hey , guys , forget it .
whosever towing us can &apos;t hear us .
you know , this is classic greendale .
that place deserves an anus flag .
can anyone get a phone signal ?
no .
no .
mine &apos;s working , but it &apos;s the black guy
with the wrong number again .
pierce , i keep telling you that that is an ipod
and you are listening to wesley snipes &apos; audiobook .
well , he sure hates the government .
this is a long shot .
but maybe if i do this , it will solve everything .
damn it !
this is all my fault .
very much so .
hey , when you go fishing , sometimes you catch a boot .
where ... re ... you ....
tel ... where ... you are !
hello ?
where are you hoodlums ?
bring my spaceship back !
uh , we are ...
40 light years outside of the buttermilk nebula ,
although it is possible ...
yeah . it &apos;s a sticker .
hey , terrible dean .
this thing is being towed with us in it .
oh . oh . okay , wait .
so handicap spots count on saturdays ?
assuming we don &apos;t wind up in a compactor ,
when we get back , i &apos;m going to step on you .
okay , as much as i might enjoy that , jeffrey ,
if you don &apos;t get back here in time for the launch ,
city college wins ,
and greendale becomes just another school on my resume
that no one can call , because it doesn &apos;t exist .
now , tell me where you are !
in a moving canister with no phone and no gps ,
because the only window is sealed shut .
hel--hello ?
jeffrey !
damn it !
it isn &apos;t sealed shut .
hmm ?
the window isn &apos;t sealed shut .
it slides open when you complete the simulation .
well , can you talk them through it ?
abed , if they can open that window ,
they can tell us where they are ,
and we can find them .
i was supposed to be on that thing .
i know how she works .
hey . that &apos;s why they need you to bring her home .
i &apos;ll get us some coffee .
psycho .
troy .
abed ?
you can get that window open by doing the simulation .
look at the panel on your right
and tell me your recipe .
original .
how many pieces ?
6
flavor heading ?
tasty .
we need to get it up to delicious .
that makes sense .
excellent work , captain .
now keep your herbs and spices balanced
while the crew helps you with teamwork .
guys , we can get the window open
if you man your terminals , and we complete the simulation .
yeah . i got a better idea .
jeffrey !
we &apos;re all dying .
we &apos;re all gonna die !
my readings indicate the need for cooperation .
i hate to pull rank on you ,
but i need you to man your station now , jeff .
i hate to pull reality on you ,
but you got your rank , captain ,
by sitting in the chair with the largest knobs !
my readings indicate pierce ...
what ?
pierce ...
my readings indicate
you &apos;re going to die alone .
why &apos;s he saying that ? why &apos;s he--
why &apos;s he saying that to me ?
uh , he--he &apos;s getting worse .
almost there .
stop talking , old man .
you can &apos;t make me stop , pierce ,
because troy is killing your life force .
i knew it !
oh !
i knew it !
abed !
kentucky one ...
do you read me ?
kentucky one , kentucky one , do you read me ?
kentucky one , copy .
kentucky . come in , kentucky .
i &apos;ve worked out a way for them to reroute the power
from the auxiliary battery .
reroute to what ?
everybody ...
here is the situation .
this is greendale .
this is the maximum distance from greendale
we can drive to haul them back up here in time
for the simulated launch .
and these are city impound lots ...
any of which might be their destination .
what are these other circles ?
what other circles ?
looks like you circled public restrooms
and truck stops . yeah .
there &apos;s another one .
okay .
that is a different side of the map ,
and that is ... for a different project .
why do they have star ratings ?
let &apos;s get to work , people !
got it .
talk to me , buddy . come on !
uh , bro , we stopped moving .
pierce has got space madness , or he &apos;s just old or something .
they &apos;re locking him up in the back .
run , jeff !
you can &apos;t do this to me !
we just did !
guys , please ! you &apos;re becoming animals !
oh , shut up !
we wouldn &apos;t even be here if it wasn &apos;t for you .
that &apos;s not true !
we weren &apos;t supposed to be in here when it happened !
when what happened ?
when we got towed ?
how did you know we were gonna get towed ?
i set it up .
i called city college about transferring ,
and the dean told me that he would get me in
if i helped sabotage greendale &apos;s launch .
i was supposed to make sure nobody was around
so that they could steal it .
and then you guys were late , and then--
wait , wait . you &apos;re transferring ?
why ?
you guys thought that butthole flag was so funny .
i mean , i respect you all enough to let you hate yourselves ,
but i respect myself too much to let you hate my school .
eh . i &apos;m not buying it .
yeah .
let &apos;s kill her .
wait ! city college was behind this ?
we have to get back in time for that launch .
why ?
we earned the right
to pick on greendale every day by going there .
our school may be a toilet , but it &apos;s our toilet .
nobody craps in it but us .
yeah .
now , that was inspiring .
seriously ?
captain .
get to your stations .
okay .
thrusters .
full .
turbo shield .
on .
navigation .
three .
chicken .
yeah .
ready ?
ready .
suppertime .
hold it ...
congratulations , crew .
you &apos;ve worked together .
now feast your eyes on the wonders of the cosmos .
greendale . greendale .
everybody be quiet . everybody quiet down .
quiet down .
say again .
stand by for location .
what do you see , gang ?
we are in ...
coldwater .
here ...
right next to the truck stop with three thumbs .
those aren &apos;t thumbs .
greendale . do you copy , greendale ?
i &apos;m sorry , jeff .
i &apos;m afraid ...
you &apos;re out of town .
i guess somebody &apos;ll come get us eventually .
i really miss greendale .
how many schools would let you make a butt flag ...
then actually fly it ?
how many schools would let you get a degree
in theoretical phys ed ?
annie ...
we owe you an apology .
nobody should have to choose between their friends
and their school .
thanks .
but you shouldn &apos;t have tattled about the flag .
i tattled .
i told the dean it was our design .
and i told him it was a butt too .
what ?
why , jeffrey ?
he kept not seeing it . i mean , it was driving me crazy .
it says &quot; e pluribus anus . &quot;
i told you we should have put cheeks on it .
there &apos;s a time and place for subtlety ,
and that time was before &quot; scary movie . &quot;
hey , guys ?
i &apos;m feeling a lot better now .
well , you ... you sound good .
yeah , you know , in a weird way ,
being in a smaller place like this ,
i was able to work through some things .
i think i &apos;m ready to come out .
i &apos;ll kill you !
i will kill you , sanders !
come on , man , come on .
let go !
no !
get off my mommy ! i &apos;m her man !
pierce , stop ! stop it ! calm down !
who &apos;s feeling skinny ?
dean ? the press is here .
i tried to buy us some time
with these double @-@ icious sandwiches ,
but they thought i was doing product integration for kfc .
this hawaiian bread is so good , though .
time to face the music .
craig .
stephen .
i &apos;m surprised to see you here .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;d miss your moment of triumph , do you--
greendale beating city college into simulated space ?
unless ...
you &apos;re having trouble locating your ship .
you ...
you were behind this ?
the next time you provoke city college ,
you will lose more than a winnebago .
greendale . come in , greendale .
go ahead , kentucky .
you can call off the rescue .
we &apos;re coming to save you .
come on , you family @-@ sized bucket of bolts .
abed , construction on spring road .
i see it . left on apple valley .
annie , left on apple .
hold tight !
hi .
hi .
hi .
get off of me .
they &apos;ll never make it back , craig .
that thing might as well be on a simulation of the moon .
oh , you know wha--
ah , yes !
hey , look out !
ladies and gentlemen ,
returning from their maiden simulation ,
the fabulous greendale greenstronauts !
i pick the team .
i pick this team .
well , annie ...
i suppose you &apos;re not city college material after all .
thank you .
annie !
good job .
that &apos;s good !
just to say-- could you hold on one second ?
great job up there , captain .
really ?
you think i could be a real astronaut someday ?
well , if nasa ever needs someone
to keep an arrow inside of a moving rectangle ,
i know who i &apos;d recommend .
abed ...
want to take a seat in the captain &apos;s chair ?
i think you &apos;ve earned it .
no , thanks . i can &apos;t imagine anything
that could have been cooler than what i &apos;ve done today .
okay , that was cool .
in the future ...
mission control , headed for base .
target acquired .
mission control , i &apos;ve got a bogie on my 6 .
yeah , i &apos;m on your 6 .
evasive maneuvers .
still on your 6 .
i took evasive maneuvers . you can &apos;t be on my 6 .
then i &apos;m on your 12 .
that means i &apos;m your 6 .
good .
