before we do , are any of joey &apos;s special &quot; romance &quot; magazines in there ?
no .
okay , all clear .
thanks , phoebe .
that &apos;s rachel .
but whatever .
everything okay in there ?
don &apos;t talk to me now .
just like his daddy .
could you do me a big favor ?
i have a meeting at the dears office .
can you watch ben for an hour ?
what about monica ?
she isn &apos;t home .
so it would just be me alone ?
ben would be there .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i &apos;ve never done that before . me and him , alone .
he &apos;s not an ex @-@ con .
okay , okay ...
what do i do with him ?
i don &apos;t know , talk to him .
entertain him . keep him alive .
okay .
ben , come here .
i &apos;m gonna leave you here with aunt rachel for about an hour , okay ?
gonna be okay ?
i think so .
i wasn &apos;t talking to you .
i &apos;ll be okay .
okay . i &apos;ll see you soon , buddy .
be back in an hour .
bye dad .
so this is fun , huh ?
not really .
okay . want something to drink ?
okay .
great . all right , how do you feel about diet coke ?
i &apos;m not allowed to have soda .
okay .
well , that &apos;s pretty much all that we have .
have you ever had a virgin margarita ?
what &apos;s a virgin ?
water it is .
the one with the truth about london
what about the second minister ? i kind of liked him .
you mean the spitter ?
come on . he wasn &apos;t that bad .
easy for you to say , you &apos;d be wearing a veil .
and the third guy ?
he kept staring at your chest .
can you blame him ?
i don &apos;t like the idea of me saying , &quot; i do ... &quot;
... while he &apos;s thinking , &quot; i &apos;d do it too . &quot;
well , then we still have a problem .
with what ?
we need someone to perform our wedding but they &apos;re all boring or annoying ...
... or keep staring at the ladies .
you should have one of us do it .
we &apos;re getting &quot; married &quot; married , not &quot; 6th @-@ grade &quot; married .
no , it &apos;s a real thing .
anyone can be ordained on the internet and perform weddings and stuff .
are you serious ?
a friend of mine did it . it &apos;s totally legal .
i call it !
what ? it was my idea !
thank you very much , but neither of you is marrying us .
does calling it not mean anything anymore ?
we &apos;re having a legitimate clergy member .
and when i say legitimate , i mean gay ...
... and in control of his saliva .
is that lemon poppy seed ?
you don &apos;t want these . they &apos;re stale .
i &apos;m leaving them outside for the pigeons .
i call them !
ben , you know , when you were a baby ...
... we &apos;d hang out all the time .
i was your daddy &apos;s girlfriend .
but you &apos;re not anymore .
no , i &apos;m not .
because you guys were on a break ...
hey , we were not on a ...
that &apos;s fine . you know what ben ?
one day when you are a lot older , i &apos;m gonna tell you that entire story ...
... over a real pitcher of margaritas . okay ?
whers my daddy coming back ?
52 minutes .
so no brothers or sisters , huh ?
that must be nice . you don &apos;t have to share stuff .
sharing is good .
you &apos;re one of those .
you know what , i had two sisters and we just tortured each other .
really ? like how ?
well , you know , we would ...
... we &apos;d repeat everything the other said ...
... or we &apos;d jump out of closets to scare each other ...
... or switch the sugar with salt so they put salt on their cereal .
that &apos;s a good one .
yeah , you like that one ?
yeah , you &apos;re funny .
i &apos;m funny ?
oh , thank god .
well , hey , i got a ton of these .
you want a good one ? here &apos;s a good one .
you take a quarter ...
... and you blacken the edge , right ?
and then you say , &quot; i bet you can &apos;t roll this quarter ...
... to your chin without it leaving your face . &quot;
and when they do it , they &apos;re left with a line down the center of their face .
can i do it to you ?
i &apos;m funny , ben , but i &apos;m not stupid .
so did you find anyone to marry you yet ?
no , but &quot; horny for monica &quot; minister called ...
... wondering if we &apos;re still together .
we &apos;ll never find anybody .
then let me do it .
joey ...
i &apos;ve been thinking .
i &apos;m an actor , so i won &apos;t get nervous in front of people .
joey , please ...
no , no , no .
i won &apos;t spit and i won &apos;t stare at monica &apos;s breasts .
everyone knows i &apos;m an ass man .
that &apos;s true .
the most important thing ...
... is , it won &apos;t be some stranger who barely knows you .
it &apos;ll be me . and i swear , i &apos;ll do a really good job .
plus , i love you guys and it would really mean a lot to me .
well , we haven &apos;t found anybody else .
might be kind of cool .
so i can do it ?
yeah , you can do it .
all right ! okay !
okay , i gotta get started on my speech .
wait a minute .
internet ministers can have sex , right ?
hey , pheebs . how &apos;s it going ?
i have a headache . a horrible headache .
i &apos;m sorry . can i get you something ?
oh , my god , you &apos;ve got to stop chattering .
here , take a couple of these .
what is it ?
it &apos;s hexedrin .
oh , no , i don &apos;t believe in western medicine .
if you just apply pressure to these points right here ...
then your hands starts to hurt and you still have a headache , so thanks .
while we &apos;re waiting for these pills to kick in , i &apos;m gonna sit you down on the couch .
come on . get some nice soft pillows under your head .
i &apos;m gonna turn the tv on . you can watch whatever you want .
sit down . i &apos;m gonna make you some tea , and then i &apos;m gonna rub your feet .
my head !
coming .
i have a bone to pick with you .
uh @-@ oh .
yes .
ben learned a little trick .
oh , did he pull the old ... ?
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right .
saran wrap on the toilet seat ...
... so the pee goes everywhere .
oh , that .
yeah , that .
you know i hate practical jokes .
they &apos;re mean , they &apos;re stupid and i don &apos;t want my son learning them .
saran wrap on the toilet seat ? isn &apos;t that just a little funny ?
i was barefoot .
oh .
this is exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
you &apos;re not laughing with someone , you &apos;re laughing at them .
and laughing at someone is not nice .
so you &apos;re one of those too .
tell me , the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him , right ?
yes .
it &apos; amazing . my headache is completely gone .
what were those pills called ?
hexedrin .
i love you hexedrin .
oh , look , it comes with a story .
phoebe , those are like the side effects and stuff .
say what ?
you know , the possible side effects .
oh , my god .
&quot; dizziness . nervousness . drowsiness .
facial swelling . nausea . headache ... &quot;
headache .
&quot; vomiting . stomach bleeding . liver damage . &quot;
i don &apos;t recall any of these coming up when you gave me these little death capsules .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . &quot; extra strength &quot; death capsules .
none of that ever happens . they just put it on there for legal reasons .
why ?
in case it happens .
hey .
say hello to reverend joey tribbiani .
you got ordained ?
yeah .
just got off the internet . man , there &apos;s a lot of porn out there .
our minister .
i can now officially marry anybody i want .
hey , you guys seem happy . if you ever want to get marry , you give me a call .
if not , you give me a call .
i have liver damage .
phoebe , your liver is right here .
okay , well , then i must be disoriented .
i started on what i &apos;m gonna say for the ceremony . want to hear it ?
listen , this is just the first draft , so ...
&quot; we are gathered here today on this joyous occasion ...
... to celebrate the special love that monica and chandler share .
it is a love based on giving and receiving ...
... as well as having and sharing .
and the love that they give and have is shared and received .
and through this having and giving ...
... and sharing and receiving ...
... we too can share and love and have ...
... and receive . &quot;
should we call the spitter ?
hey , rachel .
hi .
what a surprise . what are you doing here ?
i was just in the neighborhood ...
... and i passed by your building and thought , &quot; what &apos;s up with carol ...
... and sweet little ben ? &quot;
that &apos;s nice . well , come on in .
okay .
i &apos;ll make some coffee and we can chat .
i &apos;d love that . i would love that .
so where is sweet little ben ?
i would love to have a little ...
i found him !
very funny . come here .
that is exactly why i &apos;ve come here to talk to you , okay ?
rachel , you want sugar ?
yes , but ...
do i want sugar in my coffee ?
no , just some milk would be good , carol . thanks .
remember all that stuff i taught you yesterday ?
&quot; remember all that stuff i taught you yesterday ? &quot;
don &apos;t do that .
&quot; don &apos;t do that . &quot;
oh , damn it !
&quot; oh , damn it ! &quot;
no ! don &apos;t say that .

go back to repeating .
damn it !
oh , crap !
&quot; oh , crap ! &quot;
i feel like my face is swelling . is my face swelling ?
phoebe , your face is fine . none of this stuff is gonna happen to you .
stop being a baby .
interesting you should call me that ...
... now that i may never have one .
okay , i got some more written , ready ?
yeah , okay .
&quot; when i think of the love that these two givers and receivers share ...
... i can &apos;t help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving ...
... and giving ... &quot; and then i can &apos;t think of a good word for right here .
how about &quot; receiving &quot; ?
yes !
see , joe , not that that &apos;s not great ...
... but one cool thing about having a friend perform the ceremony ...
... is that it can be about us .
it can be more personal . you can tell stories about us .
like the time you and i went to atlantic city ...
... and i made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak ?
no .
not us .
us .
i got you . sorry .
so did you ever make him throw up a whole anything ?
did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes ?
it doesn &apos;t say that .
suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects .
joey , we want you to tell stories , but romantic stories , nice stories .
okay ! maybe i &apos;ll talk about london , when you hooked up .
only i won &apos;t say &quot; hooked up ... &quot;
... l &apos;ll say , &quot; began their beautiful journey ...
there you go . ... by doing it . &quot;
joe .
okay , all right .
so how did it happen ? did your eyes meet across the room ...
... then you &apos;re in the bathtub and she &apos;s feeding you strawberries ?
isn &apos;t that what happened to you ?
yeah !
i call that &quot; london style . &quot;
that didn &apos;t happen with us .
maybe you should say it is , because &quot; london style &quot; sounds nice .
okay , uh ...
i was sad that night because this guy thought i was ross &apos; mom .
and chandler was really sweet and he consoled me and ...
... we drank too much .
yeah , baby .
i was a gentleman and i walked her to her hotel room and said good night .
but then , later that night ...
yeah , baby .
cute p.j.s. really living it up here in london , huh ?
well , i wasn &apos;t exactly expecting company after ...
... 9 : 15 .
is joey here ?
last i saw he was with a bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries .
you &apos;re not still upset about what that guy told you , are you ?
wouldn &apos;t you be ?
it &apos;s been a really emotional time and you &apos;ve had a lot to drink ...
you have to let that go , okay ?
you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight .
really ?
you kidding ? you &apos;re the most beautiful woman in most rooms ...
whoa , what &apos;s going on ?
we just made out .
we &apos;re making out ?
not anymore .
but we don &apos;t do that .
i know , i thought it would be fun .
how drunk are you ?
enough to know i want to do this . not so much that you should feel guilty .
that &apos;s the perfect amount .
you know what &apos;s weird ?
what ?
this doesn &apos;t feel weird .
i know .
you &apos;re a really good kisser .
well , i have kissed over four women .
want to get under the covers ?
okay .
wow , you are really fast !
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you .
we &apos;re gonna see each other naked .
yep .
at the same time ?
count of three ?
one , two , three .
well , i think it &apos;s safe to say our friendship is effectively ruined .
eh , we weren &apos;t that close anyway .
joey , joey , joey ... !
hey .
hey , joe . i was just watching a movie ...
oh , dude , i &apos;m so sorry .
no !
it &apos;s cool , i &apos;m still with my bridesmaid .
where are the condoms ?
in my bag over there .
could you leave me one ?
for just you ?
yeah .
why don &apos;t you come downstairs with me . there &apos;s some really nice girls down there .
no , i &apos;m fine .
all right . there you go , buddy .
go nuts .
that &apos;s what that was ?
because that other thing , i thought you were onto something.but it did nothing for me .
can we change the topic ? because it &apos;s really doing nothing for me .
if i hadrt left you one , you two might &apos;ve never gotten together .
imagine if i had sent that hooker like i was gonna ?
it &apos;s like it was in the stars .
yeah , totally meant to be .
tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night .
what ?
what ?
what ?
who did you originally want to hook up with ?
okay , fine , but please don &apos;t be upset .
i was really depressed , okay ? and really drunk .
i wanted something stupid and meaningless . i just wanted sex .
so , when i went to your room that night ...
... i was actually looking for joey .
yeah , baby .
no , baby .
oh , my god .
you came looking for joey ?
were you planning on telling me this ?
no , i didn &apos;t think it was important .
it &apos;s not important ? it &apos;s not important ?
if it wasn &apos;t for a bridesmaid , you &apos;d be marrying him not me .
no . the point is , it was you that was there that night .
it is you that i &apos;m marrying . it is you that i fell in love with .
and it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv ...
weird . the most romantic night of my life and i &apos;m runner @-@ up .
do you know how unbelievably glad i am that joey wasn &apos;t there ?
hey !
i &apos;m a man of the cloth , but i still have feelings .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re doing this wedding now , okay ?
what ? that &apos;s not fair . it &apos;s not my fault .
i was with my bridesmaid .
and who &apos;s to say i would &apos;ve said yes ?
i mean , i would &apos;ve said yes .
you are making way too big a deal out of this .
everything worked out okay .
it &apos;s just weird , okay ?
i don &apos;t want to be saying my vows with the mental image of you and monica .
i need ... i don &apos;t know what i need . i need a walk .
wait , chandler , it &apos;s not a big deal .
it is to me .
you wanted to sleep with batman and settled for robin .
this is crazy .
no , robin is so gay .
phoebe , what were you thinking ? how could you tell him that ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m sorry , it just came out .
it &apos;s a side effect .
so now what have we agreed ?
no more pranks .
what else ?
you and daddy were not on a break .
very good .
rachel , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m just visiting my good friend carol .
your good friend ?
yeah .
what &apos;s her last name ?
carol ...
... lesbian .
nice .
by the way , that line down my face ...
what line ?
&quot; what line ? &quot; the line that prompted a student ...
... in my last class of the day to say :
&quot; dude , don &apos;t you ever wash your face ? &quot;
all right i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you .
but you were so mad already .
of course i was mad .
i told you i hate this stuff . okay ? it &apos;s not funny .
hey , ross .
hi .
what &apos;s not funny ?
practical jokes .
well , i think they &apos;re funny .
you have a line down your face .
what ?
okay , maybe they &apos;re not funny to you ...
oh , my god !
or carol .
but they &apos;re funny to kids . and who is it hurting ?
i &apos;ll tell you who it hurts . it hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class ...
... so he has to go to the principal &apos;s office wearing nothing but a catcher &apos;s mitt .
that was you ?
we heard about you in junior high .
did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout , &quot; i will be revenged ! &quot;
i will be !
i don &apos;t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore .
okay ?
fine . fine .
once i taught him that stuff , he called me &quot; fun aunt rachel . &quot;
and i loved being fun aunt rachel .
but i &apos;ll go back to being boring and uncomfortable aunt rachel .
no , it &apos;s not what i want .
i &apos;m glad you guys were bonding but ...
look , he doesn &apos;t have any siblings .
somebody has to teach him this stuff .
i haven &apos;t taught him anything a normal 6 @-@ year @-@ old doesn &apos;t know .
crap !
i gotta go .
hey .
hey .
you want this scone ? it came for me but it would rather sleep with you .
nothing even happened .
look , i know you want to do the wedding ...
no . if you don &apos;t want me to do it ...
... i accept that . i don &apos;t care about that . i just don &apos;t want you to be upset .
how can i not be upset ?
i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman ...
... and it turns out she wanted you first .
yeah , for like a half an hour one night .
chandler , she wants you for the rest of her life .
you &apos;re so lucky .
look what i missed out on by not being there .
although , you know what ?
it could never have worked out like you guys did .
because you guys are perfect for each other .
we look at you and we see you together , and it just ...
... it fits , you know ?
and you just know it &apos;s gonna last forever .
that &apos;s what you should say .
what ?
when you &apos;re marrying us , that &apos;s what you should say .
really ? i could do it ?
i &apos;d love you to do it .
hey .
but those are the words . those exact words .
well , i don &apos;t remember exactly but ...
... it &apos;s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving .
i &apos;m sorry to do this to you again ...
... but could you look after ben for a little bit ?
i &apos;ve got this meeting at school .
and he asked for his &quot; fun &quot; aunt rachel .
well , of course i will watch him . we have fun , don &apos;t we , ben ?
okay , see you later , pal .
okay .
wait a minute . ben , i can &apos;t do it .
what ?
can &apos;t let him go out that way . he &apos;s got a meeting .
you got something here on your back .
what ?
that &apos;s great . that is great .
what did we just finish talking about , ben ?
&quot; what did we just finish talking about , ben ? &quot;
all right , that &apos;s it . come here . you are in big trouble young man !
ben , come here ! i am not kidding !
you gotta stop doing ...
my god !
so you guys doing okay ?
yeah .
we talked and monica made me see that i overreacted a little bit .
some things are more important.- yeah , baby .
i &apos;m really glad you guys are okay , but i just keep thinking ...
... what would &apos;ve happened if you two had hooked up .
honey , dinner &apos;s ready !
what &apos;s my little chef got for me tonight ?
your favorite .
fried stuff with cheese .
and lots of it !
thanks , sweetheart .
give me a little sugar ...
here we go . here we go . here we go .
how you doing ?
here you go .
oh , my god .
this is a six @-@ hour pill .
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m out of the woods .
what a relief .
good for you .
it &apos;s like a huge weight has been lifted .
because , look , no hair loss , no rash , no hives .
i &apos;m just so happy !
