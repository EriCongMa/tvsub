第九集
Because merida has failed to relinquish her crown,
Her brothers will be executed.
Noooo!
Kill her!
Not today, mate.
Get us out of here.
Welcome home, Your Majesty.
Ohh. Does that hurt?
I can make it go away.
I don't need any more of your dark magic.
Really? Would you rather I sent you back
to face Merlin and Emma on your own?
My dark magic is what allowed us to escape
after you let them take control of Excalibur.
Because you spent the battle pinned to a tree.
Careful, or you'll wish you never cut me lose.
You think I want to be working with a villain like you?
Like it or not, we still need each other.
You mean you need me to help you finish
your pitiful quest to restore Excalibur.
Which I can use to destroy your sister so you can escape
and give birth to this precious child of yours.
Well, what do you suggest?
Because the combined power of Merlin and the Dark One
makes your knights useless.
Not true.
My knights will help us defeat our foes
if we give them the proper motivation.
How far can your magic transport us?
Far enough. Why?
Where do you want to go?
There's something that can help us in another land --
a land called DunBroch.
I did it, dad.
I saved the boys.
And I proved to the clans
that I am fit to be their queen.
Well, I may have united the clans behind me,
but now comes the hard part...
ruling over them.
You always made it look so easy.
I wish you were here so you --
I could ask you how you did it.
He's always with you, Merida,
even if it doesn't seem like it.
I miss him, too.
But today is not a day to wallow in sadness.
Come.
You can't be late for your own coronation.
几年前
Show yourself, witch!
There's no witch here,
just a simple woodcarver.
You gave me daughter magic,
turned me wife and boys into bears.
You're a witch.
Perhaps I... dabble with magic.
Good.
'Cause I need some.
Invaders are attacking from the south.
If I'm to lead the clans to victory over 'em,
I'm gonna need some magic.
Something to stop invaders from the south?
Something to ensure the future of my kingdom.
Yes.
I can help you.
But I must warn you, it won't come cheap.
Whatever your price is, I'll pay it.
I'm not in need of anything right now,
but perhaps in the future.
Call it an I.O.U.
Very well.
Then we have ourselves a deal.
Let's see. This.
What's it do?
Wear this helm into battle,
And you'll get exactly what you want.
Aye.
On behalf of clans Macintosh, Dingwall, and MacGuffin,
we freely give this crown.
Then it is my honor
to crown you, Merida of clan DunBroch,
as our true and rightful --
Did you forget to invite me, dear?
What are you doing here, witch?
Is this about the magic I took?
No, I'm here because of another happy customer of mine --
King Fergus.
Lies. My father would never stoop so low.
Well, he did not stoop --
except to get through the door.
But he did come for magic...
...an enchanted helm, to be exact,
one that glistens like the sun.
Merida, I'm afraid that is your father's mark.
Unfortunately, King Fergus died
before he could pay me what he owed.
Um, with interest --
10,000 gold sceats.
That much gold would bankrupt the clans three times over.
If you don't have the gold,
you could simply return the helm.
I can't return what I don't have.
Then you best find it.
If you don't return it by sundown tomorrow,
I'll have no choice but to curse the entire kingdom!
Oh, you wouldn't.
One drop of this,
and all your subjects will live out the rest of their lives --
as bears.
Quiet! Keep your heads!
Harder than it looks, dear.
If you ever hope to wear that crown,
you need to figure out how to do
what you father couldn't--lead.
You won't find the helm here.
I will if you help me look.
Check that sideboard.
No, you won't find it because it's not here.
I packed that helm in dad's trunk myself
when we left to fight the southern invaders.
You mean he was wearing it when --
When he was killed.
What was the witch on about
when she said dad didn't know how to lead?
What do you think the helm's magic did?
Whatever it did,
I'm sure Fergus had good reason for needing it.
But right now we have a more pressing question.
If the helm's lost,
what are we going to do about the witch?
I didn't say it was lost.
I just said it wasn't here.
You know where it is?
After the knight killed dad,
he took the helm from him right there on the battlefield.
Whoever the killer is, he has the helm.
No, Merida. Absolutely not.
I haven't even said anything yet!
But I know what you're thinking.
You are not going after him.
That knight already took Fergus from me.
I can't lose you, too.
If I don't figure out who he is and where to find him,
my entire kingdom will be doomed.
He killed your father for that thing.
He won't give it up without a fight.
That's what I'm counting on.
Because this time, my arrow won't miss.
You're daft if you think
we'd ever follow that wee lass into battle.
Who said that?
The next person to disrespect me daughter
loses his tongue.
Dad, it's all right. I can look after myself.
I'm afraid the front
is a lot rougher than you think, Merida.
Well, it can't be that rough
if they're writing their sweethearts back home.
Those aren't love notes, lassie.
They're wills.
They think they're gonna die?
You wanted to know what war was like.
I'm afraid this is it.
What's that?
Ah! It's me war bow.
I carried this into me first battle I ever fought.
I thought it only fitting
for you to carry it into your first battle.
You're giving it to me?
Aye.
Thank you, Dad.
What?
Are you trying to soften me up or something?
You can't hide anything from me.
Oh, your mother made me promise I'd keep you safe.
So I hired a soldier to tutor you in The Art of War.
Oh, you think I need a man to babysit me,
to teach me how to fight?
I'll show you.
You may not need a man to teach you how to fight,
but you can learn a thing or two from me.
I'm Mulan.
Merida.
I'll teach you how to fight better than any man here.
I'll teach you the most important thing
you need to have to fight -- honor.
Hand over the money,
or things are going to get messy.
Your boss promised us 10 barrels of whiskey, not 5.
So? The deal's changed.
Now give me what you owe him,
or I'm gonna take it myself.
You really think you can push us around, little lady?
Touch me again, and you lose the hand.
Is that so?
I'll let you choose.
Do you want me to take the left hand or the right?
You're daft taking on these brutes by yourself.
I had it under control.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
It's my kingdom and my family, Mulan.
I need your help.
Sorry, but the only person I help these days is myself.
Where's your sense of honor?
Honor.
Honor won't fill my purse.
What's happened to you, Mulan?
The warrior who taught me never cared for gold or riches.
Then you didn't know me very well.
If gold is what you're after, then have all I've got.
Okay, but on one condition.
Aye. What's that?
No more questions about me.
There it is.
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Easy. Easy.
I see you've met me pet.
I'm afraid I won't be as easy to subdue.
We're here for the magic helm,
I need it to save my kingdom.
You're not the only one, dear.
Unfortunately, I don't have what you're looking for.
Where is it?
If I knew where it was,
I wouldn't have sent someone to fetch it for me.
Who did you send to find it?
If you're not gonna buy anything,
I think it's time you leave.
No one out-witches me.
Tell us who's looking for the helm,
or you go bobbing for eye of newt.
All right, all right, I'll tell you.
Merida of DunBroch, King Fregus' daughter.
She was a prisoner in my dungeon.
And you let her go?
No wonder you only had half a sword.
I didn't let her go. She escaped.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?
You're lucky I'm on your side
because, when I'm done with that girl,
she'll wish that she never left your prison cell.
This is it.
This is where my dad met his end.
What is it?
This arrow, the fletching,
I'd recognize that anywhere.
I made it.
And...
You don't get it, do you?
This is the arrow I fired on that day,
the one that just missed my father's killer.
But you didn't miss his cloak.
We can use this to find him.
I've got to make him pay for what he did to my dad.
Mourn on your own time.
We're wasting daylight. Let's go.
What happened to you, Mulan?
What do you mean?
You knew Fergus, too, but you're acting like you --
like you never even met the man.
Have you already forgotten our deal?
No, I remember.
But what kind of friend would I be if it stuck to it?
Why have you closed off your heart like this?
There's one lesson I didn't teach you
the last time we were here.
A true warrior doesn't let anything hurt them.
Not bad.
Next lesson, you never leave your flank open.
I didn't. I just wanted you to think I had.
You're learning.
Fighting isn't about who's stronger.
It's about who's smarter.
Look, fellas.
Our queen-to-be knocked over her nursemaid.
Too bad there not be any lassies
for you to fight on the battlefield.
Why? Are you not gonna be there?
Merida, it's not worth it.
Why not?
I could kick his arse in front of everyone.
And that's being strong, not smart.
No one's gonna follow you out of fear.
Well, what will make them follow me?
These are your people, not mine.
If you don't know, you should ask someone who does...
...someone who they're already following.
I love my dad.
And I won't give up until he has justice.
Look, if we find a weaver,
they can tell us where this fabric was made.
Wait.
Someone's coming.
That's a clever little trick...
but not clever enough.
Oh, come now.
You wouldn't attack a mother-to-be, now, would you?
Arthur, what are you doing here?
I'm not going back to your dungeon
if that's what you're thinking.
You really think I'd come all the way to this wretched place
just to drag you back to Camelot?
We're here for something else, dear --
Your father's helm.
You, the witch --
why does everybody want that bloody helmet?
It's the only way I'll ever save my kingdom.
So has the witch threatened to turn your people into bears, too?
You don't even know what the helm does, do you?
It has the power to make other men fight your battles,
however dangerous they may be.
Are you lying?
That can't be.
It is.
And it's the only way I'll ever get my knights
to stand up to Merlin and the Dark One.
No, my dad would never use magic
to force people to fight for him.
Aww, apparently, daddy dearest
wasn't the great king that you thought he was.
Back off.
We need that helm to stop the witch from cursing this land.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to find some other way to do that.
And who will even notice?
These people are practically animals already.
Even if we wanted to give it to you, we can't.
We don't have it.
Perhaps you don't, but we will.
That belonged to my father!
I know.
And with a simple locator spell,
it'll lead us to another one of his possessions --
the helm.
No.
But that bow was the last thing he ever gave me.
Then you'll have to console yourself with memories
and the knowledge of what a terrible ruler
he turned out to be.
Ta-ta.
Where are you going?
Where do you think? Home.
Well, don't. There's no need.
They may have your bow, but we have this.
We'll find that helm first.
Oh, you don't get it, do you?
It's not about how we find the helm --
it's about what the helm's magic does.
Why does that matter?
Well, 'cause now I understand what the witch meant
when she said my dad couldn't lead.
If he can't do it without magic, how can I?
Merida -- - No.
My father used dark magic to lead innocent men to their deaths,
and he paid the price for it.
He died, too.
I'm not gonna make the rest of the kingdom suffer
just to prove I could do what he couldn't.
So you're gonna let the witch curse DunBroch?
No, I'm gonna do what I should've from the start --
tell Macintosh and the rest of the lords
I can't find the helm,
give them enough time to get it
before the witch turns us all into bears.
Those lords can't even find the pointy end of their spear.
Well, they still stand a better chance than I ever will.
You cannot give up like this!
Why not? You have.
Or is there another reason you're out here
working for the highest bidder?
What are you doing down here?
I wanted to stand watch for myself.
The invaders will be sailing in any day now.
Do you think we'll win the war?
Ah, we'll give 'em everything we got.
What is it, daughter?
I can tell something's on your mind.
Mulan's a right good teacher.
There's one thing she can't teach me about leading this army.
What might that be?
How to inspire the clans to follow me into battle?
How do you do it?
How have you inspired all these men
to follow you into battle,
especially when so many of them know they're gonna die?
Dad...
...is everything all right?
Aye.
There's only one way
to get men to follow you into a deadly battle.
That's by showing them
you're the first one willing to die.
'Cause if their king is willing to lay down his life,
they know just how important winning the battle is.
Is that really what you're gonna do?
Aw, you don't have to worry about me, lass.
I'm the bear king.
I faced Mor'du.
I can handle whatever the southern invaders throw at us.
Now, unless you want them to slip by,
best keep me eye on the sea.
All right, witch.
Show me who this cloak belongs to.
You're not a wolf.
You just need a little help remembering who you are.
Sorry about that.
My name's Ruby.
My friends call me Red.
How did you know I was a girl in wolf's clothing?
You're not the first person I've met
who a witch turned into a animal.
Mm. Yeah, well,
wolfing out is kind of my thing.
But the witch found a way to put me under her thrall.
Are you Mulan?
Yes. Have we met?
No, but my friends told me about you.
Phillip and Aurora?
Mary Margaret and Emma.
But, uh, I know Phillip and Aurora.
I was in the other land with them.
Last I saw, they're doing great.
They were about to have a child.
Is everything okay? Did I say something?
No, I'm fine.
It's just I know how difficult it is
traveling between realms.
How did you end up back here?
Excuse me,
if I could have everyone's attention just for a moment...
It is our great joy to introduce you to our son...
Prince Neal.
What is it?
What's what?
Well, we just defeated the Wicked Witch
and survived a time-travel adventure
we didn't know we were a part of,
and you're...what? The new bathroom attendant?
What's going on? What's wrong?
I'm fine.
Okay.
Look...
ever since we got back to Storybrooke,
I feel like I haven't...
fit in.
And at first I thought it was because of the curse,
but now that it's been broken, I --
Because you're the only one of your kind here.
Maybe.
I don't know. I --
Yeah, probably.
I just -- I want to find more people like me.
So I've been helping Tiny work on his burnt-out fields,
back when we thought we were gonna have to escape Zelena, and...
we haven't had much luck,
but we did manage to grow this.
You want to go back to the Enchanted Forest.
Please don't try to stop me. I know you think I'm crazy.
I think you need to do what makes you happy.
Really?
You are my friend.
What else could I possibly want for you?
It doesn't mean I'm not gonna miss you.
Not as much as I'll miss you.
And did you find what you were looking for here?
No.
My pack, the...others like me were gone.
There's no trace of them.
So I went to the witch for help.
And that's when she turned you into her guard dog.
Thank you for freeing me.
At least my visit helped someone.
Why exactly were you there?
I set a bad example for an old friend.
I wanted to find a way to make things right.
I thought the witch might have some magic
that would help us track down
the man who killed my friend's father.
That belonged to him?
Yes.
You don't need magic to hunt the killer down.
Come on. Let's go help your friend.
You can't seriously be considering
giving the crown to him?
It's the only way to ensure
we won't all end up under the witch's curse.
I think I'd rather be a bear again
than bow down to Clan Macintosh.
Mom.
If you can find the helm before the witch's deadline...
...the crown is yours.
Don't hand it over just yet.
You were right, Merida.
I gave up, and I was wrong.
But so were you.
We're gonna find the knight that ran Fergus through.
How?
I brought a friend.
I'm gonna sniff him out.
Have you already forgotten everything I taught you?
Why do we have to start before the rooster's even crowed.
The invaders.
You brought me out here to keep me from the fight.
Dad put you up to it, didn't he?
Merida...
Out of my way.
No.
Draw!
Only cowards attack
without declaring where they're from
or who they fight for.
We're not ashamed of who we are.
No!
So let's show them what happens
when you face the combined might
of Clans DunBroch, Macintosh,
Dingwall, and MacGuffin!
I am not gonna miss this fight.
Dad!
Fergus!
No!
No!
No!
Let's go.
Are you certain the helm's here?
Well, this is where daddy DunBroch's bow
says it is.
When will you learn to stop doubting me, dear?
That doesn't belong to you.
Oh, you don't know when to give up.
Where is he? Where's the man who killed my dad?
That's him. He killed Fergus.
His scent is all over this cloak.
You...
You're the one.
I led my knights on a quest
to find the missing piece of Excalibur.
We heard rumor of magic in these lands,
so I landed here in the hopes
I could finally complete my sword.
So it's true.
You killed my father.
A knight does what he must on the battlefield.
You're gonna get yourself killed.
She isn't the only one.
This isn't about revenge.
This is about you finding the helm
and saving your people.
But he -- if you're the one who killed my dad,
why don't you have the helm?
I saw you take it off him with my own eyes.
'Cause the helm Fergus was wearing when he died
wasn't enchanted.
What?
It was a piece of iron polished to a shine.
When I put it on to rally my men, it didn't do anything.
We lost the battle.
Dad must've thrown the helm he got from the witch
into the sea before the battle began.
And you know what this means, right?
He didn't use magic to lead the troops into battle.
They followed him because they believed in him.
Oh, as touching as this family drama is,
we need the helm.
And I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to stop you from leaving DunBroch with it.
My people are counting on me.
And so are mine.
I've already kelled DunBroch's king.
Now it looks like I'll have to kill its queen.
You have no idea of the dark path you sent me down.
Oh, I've been down plenty of my own.
It's the burden of wearing a crown.
I blamed myself for my dad's death,
when I really should've blamed you.
I'm not just gonna keep you from getting the helm.
I'm gonna make you pay for what you did to him.
Don't take another step.
This isn't your battle.
Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?
You don't scare me.
Sleeping powder. Clever.
She used it on me.
How do you like it now, witch?
Hurry. It won't last long.
I need that helm to get Excalibur
and fulfill my destiny as Camelot's king.
Reach for it,
and I will cut you down just like your father.
Make another move,
and you'll look like a porcupine.
This time, one of those arrows
is bound to hit more than just your cloak.
Oh, where's that bloody witch when I need her?
She's sleeping on the job.
Even your magic can't stop all these arrows.
Seems we need to find some other means of retrieving Excalibur.
Yes.
But perhaps that's a discussion best had in Camelot.
Who's she?
Thank you.
All of you.
I wouldn't have the helm if it wasn't for you.
We couldn't let our queen fall.
After all this...
...you still want me to be your queen?
You were willing to give up your crown
for the good of the kingdom,
give up your life to get that helm.
I only ever saw one person make a sacrifice like that,
and it was your father.
If you're not fit to lead the clans,
no one is.
Presenting Queen Merida of DunBroch,
leader of the clans, protector of the highlands
and my daughter.
You're early.
The sun's nearly set.
Unless you want to rule over a kingdom of bears,
you better have me helm.
Oh, I have it,
But I'm not gonna hand it over to you.
I'm going to destroy it.
Are you sure that's wise, dear?
Merida?
I know what I'm doing, mother.
No one should have the power
to lead people into a fight they don't believe in.
I'll find a way to stop your curse,
but I am not going to be bullied into giving this back.
I was hoping you'd say that.
What, now?
This was never about the helm, dear.
This was about you.
You mean this was all a test?
King Fergus came to me asking for magic
to ensure the future of his kingdom,
and that's exactly what I gave him.
Getting the helm back made me understand
what it takes to rule.
Your magic's never very direct, is it?
It gets the job done.
I pride myself on satisfied customers.
Are we done, then?
Not quite.
I wouldn't have come to a coronation without a gift.
It's not another carving of a bear, is it?
Better.
There's one person
who could not be here today to see you crowned.
My dad.
What's that?
Magical ale.
You know the legend of Seonaidh, don't you, dear?
Aye. Is it true?
Indeed.
One cup of this can summon the spirit of anyone
who's passed to the underworld.
You mean I can talk to my dad?
Thank you.
Long live, Queen Merida!
Thank you.
If it weren't for the two of you,
I'd have let my whole kingdom down.
And if it weren't for you,
I'd still be shaking down thugs in a tavern.
And I'd still be licking my chops
in that witch's cottage.
Here.
It wouldn't be honorable for me to keep this.
Does this mean I can finally ask
what happened before I found you?
Well, if you must know...
I was trying to get over a broken heart.
I waited too long
to tell someone how I felt about them.
And when I finally worked up the courage,
it was too late.
I'm sorry, Mulan.
You know, I might not be the best person
to ask for dating advice.
I kind of ate the only boyfriend I've ever had.
Yes, I think that disqualifies you.
But... maybe I can help.
Come with me.
It might do you some good.
Searching for werewolves?
It's better than wallowing in self-pity.
I don't wallow.
Look, maybe helping someone else find their path
will help you with yours.
Thank you.
Well, good luck.
To both of you.
Here it goes.
Don't waste that.
It's good ale.
Dad.
Merida...
You did it.
You became queen.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I lost faith in you.
I thought you used the enchanted helm
to lead your troops into battle.
It's all right.
I lost faith in meself
when I went to the witch for that helm.
Why didn't you use it?
What made you change your mind?
You did...
The night before the battle.
After I spoke to you,
I realized if I wanted to show you
what it took to be a leader,
I couldn't use magic to do it.
You showed me what a true leader is.
And I will never forget that.
I just want to make you proud, dad.
You already have.
I wish you were still here.
Me too.
Dad...
I love you.
Arthur...
you have no idea what's coming for you.
