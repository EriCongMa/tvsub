evening , hot chocolate .
max , we got big trouble from little china .
hi , max .
big trouble ?
there &apos;s nothing big about him .
he looks like i won him in a bear claw machine .
max , what is the worst sentence you ever want to hear
come out of han &apos;s mouth ?
i got you pregnant ?
come on , bad , bad .
i got you pregnant again ?
i &apos;m putting in karaoke .
no ! no !
han ...
those guys better be up there
because we &apos;re officially putting ass crack on the menu .
i am adding a tv to bring in more customers .
we can have theme nights , ultimate fighting nights ,
real desperate housewives of bravo city nights ,
and best of all ,
karaoke night .
you can &apos;t get hipsters on microphone .
that &apos;s like throwing gasoline on a pretentious fire .
hipsters like karaoke .
replace the word &quot; like &quot; with the word &quot; hitler &quot;
and you got the three worst things in history .
max , i hear what you say , but
* everybody else say &quot; he @-@ ey ! &quot; *
* where are my single ladies ! *
okay . next person is going to sing teenage dream by katy perry ,
who is pretty now but used to have very horrible acne .
this is the third teenage dream in 45 minutes .
why don &apos;t i just close my nuts in the cashier &apos;s drawer ?
come on up now , girl named &quot; stacey . &quot;
i got this .
look , i don &apos;t know you , but i like you .
and i respect both hair choices .
i hate karaoke .
i can &apos;t afford to have any more hate in my head .
my hate is at capacity .
sit this one out , i &apos;ll comp your cobbler .
what did you do ?
i saved earl &apos;s nuts .
pick up ! hot food . pick up .
calm your bells down , oleg .
not my stations .
where &apos;s caroline ?
would it make you jealous if i said
she was back here with me ?
jealous ? no .
pissed ? probably .
because we &apos;re busy and it would take me all that time
to get the duct tape off her mouth and hands .
what are you doin &apos; in here , snow white ?
if you &apos;re lookin &apos; for one of your dwarves ,
he &apos;s out there , holding the mic .
look , my bite is off .
see , i did the bite test .
the number seven incisor is crossing over number nine .
hold up . you know the names of your teeth ?
don &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t even know the name of my father .
ow , i just bit my tongue .
ah ! number 12 just joined the party .
i &apos;d stop doing that right now .
you just made it into oleg &apos;s spank bank .
congratulations .
what am i gonna do without my bite guard ?
my teeth don &apos;t know where to go .
well , maybe they should just backpack for a couple of years ,
so they figure it out .
listen , perfect teeth ,
this is a nightmare for me .
the technical term for this is &quot; advanced bruxism . &quot;
and the technical term for you is &quot; overly dramatic . &quot;
yesterday you freaked out &apos; cause we were out of toilet paper .
just hold it till you get to work like everybody else .
now , maybe i sing while others wait .
uh @-@ oh . we got real problems now .
i choose susan boyle popular song
from all clips on internet .
it &apos;s called i dream--
keep dreaming .
oh , you &apos;re back .
we thought you ran away .
chestnut and i were just about to pick out
another human from the shelter .
i had quite a day .
8 : 00 to 10 : 00 ... grind , grind , pain .
10 : 00 to 11 : 00 ... pain , pain , grind .
so i went to the drug store
and bought an $ 8 bite guard ,
which didn &apos;t fit my freaky tim burton mouth .
and when i tried to return it ,
the cashier , rhonda ,
whose nametag said she was happy to help ,
but who was neither happy nor helpful ,
said that i couldn &apos;t return it
because it had already touched my &quot; teef . &quot;
for someone whose jaw is about to unhinge ,
you &apos;re sure flapping it a lot .
why is this rag with my father on it here ?
don &apos;t look at me . chestnut bought it .
he likes it when i read him his daily horse @-@ oscope .
why is everybody so obsessed with the fact that
he hasn &apos;t said anything ?
haven &apos;t you ever been at a loss for words ?
tampons , yes . words , nah .
well , this will make me feel better .
whenever i &apos;m in pain , i need a treat .
you know , whenever you &apos;re in pain , that is my treat .
sushi ! i hope you like crab roll .
i never had sushi .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense .
no sushi , no dentist ... who are you ?
a poor person .
sushi &apos;s lazy .
if i come to your restaurant ,
get up off your ass and cook the damn fish .
i wish we could afford to go to this little sushi place
in tribeca where my father always took me .
we had this little joke .
every time we &apos;d walk in , i &apos;d always say ...
&lt; i &gt; すみません もう少し大トロお願いします &lt; / i &gt;
and we would just laugh !
so you &apos;re not funny in japanese either .
i got this at a corner deli .
the cashier was japanese .
she said it was good .
oh , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s great .
&apos;cause the disenfranchised immigrant
serving the spoiled white girl
would have no reason to lie .
get ready for something heavenly !
that &apos;s not heaven .
spit it out .
what a disappointment .
your first time .
well , that &apos;s kinda the way it goes with me and first times .
here , clean yourself off .
that &apos;s exactly the way it goes !
it &apos;s not that bad .
it &apos;s not that bad . it &apos;s not that bad .
no .
for a dentist office in the subway ,
it &apos;s pretty good .
seriously , how are you not running out of here ?
i have no choice .
now that i have no money or health insurance ,
i have to get used to this third @-@ world situation .
third @-@ world situation ?
this is an underworld situation .
okay , there &apos;s bulletproof glass .
with a bullet in it .
all right , so the glass works .
it says to sign in .
look , why don &apos;t you just take some of our cupcake business savings
and go to a good dentist office ?
you know , one where you won &apos;t get a staph infection
just from looking at the floor .
no , we can &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s our future .
once we start doing that ,
it &apos;s a slippery slope .
&quot; nicole richie &quot; ?
i don &apos;t want anyone to know i was here .
i know this situation is less than ideal ,
but i am having a dental emergency .
no , he &apos;s having a dental emergency .
come on , let &apos;s go over here
and see if this man can help me .
hi .
welcome to subway smiles .
i told ya , we &apos;ll get to ya .
i &apos;m sorry , girls .
i &apos;m a little shaky .
i was just shot at .
i have a problem with my teeth migrating .
i have advanced bruxism .
ah . i have hep c.
everybody &apos;s got their something .
what do you need ?
we need to be leaving .
i just need a bite guard .
oh ! i can do that .
that &apos;s where i squirt foam into your mouth
and make a mold .
come in the back .
if you go back there with him ,
you &apos;ll need a bite guard and a rape guard .
you want the gas ?
is that necessary ?
you &apos;re gonna want the gas , sweetheart .
one more song before we close .
i sing spice girls&apos;
* aww , tell me what you want , *
* what you really , really want . *
that boy &apos;s more stiff
than michele bachmann &apos;s husband at a chippendales .
i will give you the money for trip to fancy dentist .
really ? oleg , you would do that ?
it &apos;s favor i do for you .
and at some point , when i come to you for favor ,
you will say yes , like i say yes now .
well , i &apos;d need to know what that favor might be .
i can &apos;t say for sure .
will it be in a week or a month ?
i can &apos;t say for sure .
will it be sexual ?
yes , it will be .
this i can say for sure .
thank you , but no .
i am such an idiot .
i like it . keep going .
my bite guard is just sitting in the bathroom of my townhouse .
if i could only get up on the roof ,
then i could break in through the skylight
like i used to when i snuck out in high school .
hello , i &apos;m max . have we met ?
when i was 15 , i paid the security system guys extra
to not wire the skylight ,
and then i snuck out and went to ilana shapiro &apos;s sweet 16 ...
cute .
in greece .
hardcore .
i used to sneak out of the house
and huff spray paint with an ex @-@ marine .
and sometimes , i &apos;d just sneak out ,
look up at the stars , and dream .
and then you said that .
see , i told you i can get this skylight open .
turn on a light !
wait till i close the closet door .
why are the floors so bouncy ?
it &apos;s called &quot; carpet . &quot;
what ?
no way . no way .
is this narnia ?
i &apos;m about to say something i swore i &apos;d never say .
o.m.g.
again ... o.m.g.
it &apos;s lame , but nothing else really nails it .
this is the room that o.m.g. was born for .
max , it &apos;s just my closet .
your clothes have a house !
look , look !
you are rich !
like , i know you &apos;ve said you were rich ,
but you are rich .
you &apos;re embarrassing me .
are you crazy ?
this is nothing to be embarrassed about .
what &apos;s this do ?
oh , my god .
you have a shoe rotisserie .
i designed it .
i call it my &quot; ferris heels . &quot;
i &apos;d judge you if that wasn &apos;t exactly what
i &apos;d call it if i had one .
okay , we should really go now .
let me just grab my bite guard .
what ?
you have a museum in your closet ?
come on , it &apos;s just a bathroom .
just a bathroom ?
it &apos;s the louvre of pooping .
here it is .
do you two need to be left alone ?
we have to go .
can &apos;t risk staying much longer .
wow . just when i thought your voice couldn &apos;t get any more grating .
it &apos;ll loosen up .
seriously , we should go .
oh , um , i just have to do one thing before we go .
i think me and your tub are going steady .
oh , you found the jacuzzi button .
i don &apos;t know who found who ,
but we &apos;re together now .
i &apos;m totally stealing some of these ridonculous bath soaps .
this one &apos;s shaped like a vagina .
it &apos;s a seashell .
sister , this is a mint green vagina .
did you go to the prom with your dad ?
that &apos;s my debutante dance ,
when i came out .
out ?
like you came out that you were dating your dad ?
gross .
i think i can still fit a goose feather pillow in .
hey , what &apos;s this one of you and chestnut and your dad ?
oh , that &apos;s when my dad bought chestnut for me .
it was my first @-@ period present .
your dad got you a horse for getting your period ?
o.m.g.
know how i celebrated getting my period ?
stole a painkiller and half a beer from my mom &apos;s boyfriend .
wasn &apos;t a horse , but it was pretty awesome .
how come there are no pictures of your mom ?
&apos;cause there aren &apos;t any .
she cheated on my dad when i was five ,
and my grandmother got rid of her .
not in , like , a mob way .
in a society way , which is worse .
so who raised you ?
well , estella from 1989 to &apos; 96 .
then , dominica from &apos; 97 until she went back to guatemala .
then no one .
funny . you didn &apos;t have a father ,
and i didn &apos;t have a mother . so we &apos;re--
oh , we &apos;re alike ?
look around . we have nothing in common .
hey , what &apos;s this button for ?
music .
oh , let me guess . show tunes ? boy bands ?
i love this song !
see ? i knew what we had in common wouldn &apos;t last .
were you krumping for a second ?
maybe .
were you tootsie @-@ rolling for a second ?
yes .
okay , get dressed .
we really should go now .
i have all the essentials .
tampons , toilet paper , comforter , body shimmer .
wait , what about the clothes ?
oh , what am i gonna do ?
walk around williamsburg in a $ 3000 gown ?
oh , my god .
wait a minute .
grab everything with a price tag on it
that we can resell .
or that you think i &apos;d look amazing in .
not the furs ! they &apos;re wired !
why would you wire the furs ?
everybody wires the furs , bitch !
security &apos;s gonna be here in ten minutes .
just grab everything you can .
wait ! how are we going to carry it all back to brooklyn ?
jealous ?
look , two seats .
i think you got more stuff than me .
well , you spent five minutes saying good @-@ bye to the tub .
this was my fave purse to take dancing .
how &apos;d you keep it on your shoulder when you went all mad krump ?
look . $ 200 !
it &apos;s not enough we &apos;re sitting on the subway in furs ...
you gotta make it rain ?
this is so exciting .
it &apos;s going right into our cupcake fund .
or ...
or what ?
where was that place you always went with your dad ?
toro with black truffle .
you are about to have a sushi toro @-@ gasm .
will you calm down ? it &apos;s just--
oh , sweet bejesus , that &apos;s delicious !
if this is sushi ,
what was that other stuff we ate ?
wrong . on every level .
we need more of this .
like , all of it .
can we have some more toro ?
thank you so much .
and , uh ...
&lt; i &gt; すみません もう少し大トロお願いします &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; 大トロ一丁お願いします &lt; / i &gt;
i get it now &apos; cause i &apos;m rich .
i don &apos;t know how you &apos;re pulling it off .
what do you mean ?
giving up everything that you had .
the maids , the closet , the dentist , the sushi , the tub .
all of it . the tub .
i almost can &apos;t give it up ,
but i only had it for an hour .
you &apos;re kind of a badass .
max , you just called me a badass .
i &apos;m drunk on black truffle .
it &apos;s my dad !
wait , he actually exists ?
like the townhouse and the tub ?
the tub .
hi , daddy . how are you ?
i miss you so much .
i &apos;m good . no , really .
i &apos;m still staying in brooklyn with my friend , max .
she &apos;s great .
oh , okay . hold on .
love you , daddy .
he wants to talk to you .
me ? why ?
i wouldn &apos;t know what to say .
take it ! he &apos;s only allowed five minutes .
yo , what &apos;s up , martin channing ?
you &apos;re welcome , but i di--
well , thank you .
yeah , she &apos;s great .
real trooper .
well , bye . what ?
okay , i &apos;ll tell her .
daddy ?
he &apos;s gone .
so that &apos;s what a father sounds like .
what did he say ?
he wanted me to remind you to wear your bite guard .
see , he can &apos;t be as bad as everyone says .
he just can &apos;t be .
&lt; i &gt; ありがとうございました &lt; / i &gt;
oh , my god .
the 200 didn &apos;t cover it .
start checking the purses !
oh , hey . do you take hats ?
any cougars in the house ?
and in case you don &apos;t know , &quot; cougar &quot;
means older lady with a large sexual appetite .
lady past prime with tight clothes
who wants sex from young men .
max , what is the one thing worse than karaoke ?
oh , no .
that &apos;s right .
open mic night .
cougar also have face lift .
from behind , look 22 .
she turn around , 72 .
it &apos;s true !
it &apos;s funny &apos; cause it &apos;s true .
bad news .
they heightened security because we tripped the alarm .
the entire townhouse is locked down .
we can never go back !
my tub !
why does anything that gives me pleasure wind up behind bars ?
forget about the tub .
everything was inventoried .
we can &apos;t sell the furs .
i should &apos;ve thought of that !
yeah , you should &apos;ve .
&apos;cause you know they always inventory the furs , bitch !
