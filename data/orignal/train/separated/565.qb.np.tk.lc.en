and we &apos;re back .
welcome , students , new and old
to another fall semester at greendale !
it &apos;s time for clean slates and fresh starts .
celebrate your fresh start tonight
at the fresh start dance in the cafeteria .
the same cafeteria where britta perry
publicly professed her love to jeff winger
who then walked out on her .
unforgettable !
plus , free punch and fresh start cookies tonight
at the fresh start dance !
look at us ... living together ,
driving to school together .
i know . we &apos;re like batman and shaft .
batman actually had a guy . his name was robin .
he rode around with him .
troy , batman &apos;s friend didn &apos;t have to be robin .
it could have been shaft , dolemite ...
leroy brown .
don &apos;t let society limit your people .
batman and shaft . wow !
you &apos;re reading troy &apos;s twitter page
where he posts everything pierce says ?
yeah ! &quot; oldwhitemansays &quot; ? it &apos;s hilarious .
hello , honey !
i like your hair .
oh , thank you , abed .
you &apos;re welcome .
jeffrey . hello !
hey ! how was your summer ?
lived with you .
oh , yeah .
okay .
so ... are you guys ready for whatever ...
anthropology is ?
we should wait for britta .
do we know if she &apos;s coming back ?
she never returned any of my calls or emails .
me neither .
it &apos;s not gonna be the same without her .
hey , did you guys see toy story 3 ?
yes !
oh , i love toy story 3 !
hey , toy story-- britta !
okay . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
i made an ass of myself and jeff at that dance .
i was just caught up in a competition
with his turd of an ex @-@ girlfriend ,
and i wish i could erase the entire night ,
and i owe you an apology .
i accept .
oh , sweetie , you don &apos;t owe us anything ,
and you don &apos;t have to hide from us .
you ? i &apos;m hiding from them .
it &apos;s like high school all over again .
psycho britta , the walking freak show
for every barbie with a cosmo subscription .
look , i don &apos;t mean to be a tool ,
but you embarrassed me that night too ,
so call it karma .
oh , boy .
i hope i &apos;m not around when you do mean to be a tool .
let &apos;s just put this behind us
and just walk to class , okay ?
yeah .
yeah .
you &apos;re britta perry ?
yeah . what &apos;s it to you ?
you are the ... coolest !
right . um ...
at what , exactly ?
being fearless !
honest . speaking from your heart .
&quot; jeff winger , i love you . &quot;
right . um ...
my heart may have overstated--
do you sign stuff ?
now and again .
awesome .
i don &apos;t like where that &apos;s going .
i know . right ?
um ... annie , do you remember the little talk we had ?
the one about discretion ?
yes . stop that .
look , we agreed that you and i kissing was a mistake .
and if anyone were to find out about it ,
i would be tarred , feathered ,
and put on one of those websites people check
when they &apos;re buying a house .
it &apos;s forgotten , jeff !
jeez , i &apos;m not some love @-@ struck teenybopper !
but you should know , we didn &apos;t just kiss .
we technically frenched .
i checked the make @-@ out meter in this month &apos;s issue of--
national review .
i don &apos;t like where that &apos;s going .
第二季 第一集
senor chang !
oh , wait . i guess it &apos;s not senor anymore .
what should we call you ? student chang ?
two credits into a music major chang ?
okay . how &apos; bout not calling me anything ... hmm ?
why are you guys in this class ?
oh . we chose it together .
the real question is ... why are you in it ?
oh ! you missed us ?
oh ho ! don &apos;t flatter yourself , okay ?
have you checked out the course description ?
ancient weaponry ? genital mutilation ?
subject &apos;s talkin &apos; my changuage .
i don &apos;t get it .
well , star @-@ burns has grown reliant
on his star @-@ shaped sideburns
but still craves identity beyond them , so he added a hat .
no , what &apos;s up with britta @-@ mania ?
oh . oh , that &apos;s even simpler .
in the eyes of the public , britta put herself out there ,
you walked away ,
makeing her the underdog , the jill t , the aniston .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
hey , jeff , do you have any hillbilly cousins ?
i wish . why ?
what about a wealthy uncle ?
or an old drinking buddy
that may or may not have had a sex change ?
why are you mining my life for classic sitcom scenarios ?
i guess i &apos;m just excited about the new year ,
looking for ways to improve things .
i &apos;m hoping we can move away
from the soapy relationshipy stuff
and into bigger , fast @-@ paced , self @-@ contained escapades .
what is it , exactly ,
that separates man from animal ?
divorce ?
tools . like this blowgun i used
to hunt monkeys with the korubo in the amazon .
my name is professor june bauer ,
and this semester ,
i will guide you to the very threshold of your humanity ,
where you will lock eyes
with the shrieking , blood @-@ drenched
sister @-@ raping beasts from which we sprang .
you will also have to make a diorama .
for your first assignment ,
i would like you to form tribes of no more than eight
and , if you can , mix up the races ,
or you &apos;ll be surprised at how quickly things get awkward .
you know , now that troy &apos;s off the streets
and living with me ,
he &apos;s learning so much about the world .
yeah . tell me again why jewish people wear yarmulkes .
half a hat . saves money .
thank you !
&quot; half a hat &quot; ? that is so offensive !
i love &quot; oldwhitemansays . &quot;
hey , find an eighth dork for your tribe of dorks ?
chang , i &apos;m starting to think you took anthropology
because you wanna be in our study group
but are too proud to ask .
what ? keep dreaming , winger .
would somebody with too much pride ... do this ?
current balance , $ 23.20 .
consider yourself chang @-@ ed .
some mac and cheese , please .
sorry . looks like your food just walked out on ya .
same way you did britta .
hey . can we talk ?
oh . now he wants to talk .
no . it &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll be right back .
man , uh ... you got some real passionate fans .
ah , it &apos;ll blow over .
would you mind , um ... helping it blow over ?
my stock is kinda plummeting around here .
i don &apos;t mean to sound like a tool ,
but maybe it &apos;s karma .
britta , i know you &apos;re excited
to finally be popular with women ,
but don &apos;t get too high on your own drama .
high on my own drama ?
people &apos;s champion !
sorry , man .
i gotta go where the heat is .
jeff winger , you &apos;re a jerk !
she &apos;s turned every woman on campus against me .
well , not every woman .
certainly not the one that deserves to be with you .
annie , all women deserve to be with me .
and vice versa .
granted .
but who doesn &apos;t eventually settle down ?
i don &apos;t . and i never will .
and if i did--
if i did ...
i can beat britta at her own game .
oh , good .
yeah , you better take a hike !
do you know where the cleanest bathroom is ?
teacher &apos;s lounge .
thank you .
don &apos;t be shy . come on up , have a sip .
the yogi of india swear by its restorative powers .
okay .
more of my urine for me .
now for your tribe &apos;s assignment .
this box contains nine different tools ,
all of them important to humanity &apos;s survival .
one of them is the most important of all .
your tribe &apos;s assignment for tomorrow
is to tell me which tool that is .
questions ?
i have a question .
but not for you . it &apos;s for britta .
britta ...
i love you .
now , i know this puts you in an awkwardly powerful position ,
but i have to know right now , in front of everyone ...
do you love me too ?
more than anything in the world .
really .
yeah .
so ...
it begins ...
the greatest relationship ever known .
this is making me sick .
i &apos;m gonna love you forever .
good . i &apos;m gonna love you forever .
i don &apos;t believe you .
why ? don &apos;t you want me to ?
no , i do . bring it .
doesn &apos;t it make you wanna cry ?
something like that . excuse me .
i downloaded a song that makes me think of you .
let &apos;s listen to it , each using one earbud .
shirley , would you consider spinning off with me ?
just riffing , but we could open a hair salon together .
well , i don &apos;t understand . is this you being meta ?
i wanted to come out of the gate having adventures ,
like paintball . this is boring .
well , i think that &apos;s selfish , abed .
if you were a friend to jeff and britta ,
you would see their relationship as an adventure .
i hadn &apos;t thought about it that way .
oh , look at how they walk !
clearly , the most important tool to a tribe &apos;s survival
is here--the cross , representing christianity .
that &apos;s an ax .
it &apos;s an ax ?
maybe it &apos;s the telescope .
you can look through it backwards ...
shrink your enemies !
i &apos;ll show you the tool
that &apos;s most important to our survival .
but fair warning-- it &apos;s my penis .
oldwhiteman ...
sorry i &apos;m late . i was in my car loving britta .
i guess i just love you too much .
not half as much as me .
jeff , do you think you &apos;ll marry britta ?
i &apos;d like to see someone stop me .
i just peed a little .
then here . propose .
i got it , i got it , i got it !
jeff winger ...
will you marry me ?
yeah , yeah , of course .
perfect . i &apos;ll be right back .
thank the lord you &apos;re getting married !
i was so worried about your souls
ever since you had premarital sex on the table !
awesome !
you told shirley ?
well , there &apos;s no need for secrecy now !
it was during the paintball game .
was there anything you didn &apos;t win that day ?
oh , my god .
you slept with her and then kissed me ?
what ?
now they &apos;re in so deep
you know she &apos;s such a fool for him
she has a ring around her fin @-@ ger @-@ errr
and abed hired an irish singer
britta &apos;s marryin &apos; , britta &apos;s marryin &apos; ,
britta &apos;s marryin &apos; jeffrey winger &lt; i &gt;
what the hell is this ?
a wedding . episode .
abed , there &apos;s no wedding .
cold feet ?
talk it over with your best man george clooney .
what &apos;s up ?
he &apos;s a george clooney impersonator ,
but still , razzle dazzle , right ?
abed .
hmm ?
jeff made out with annie .
what ? when ?
where ?
yeah , where ?
that &apos;s inappropriate . i &apos;m assuming in the mouth .
it was after the transfer dance .
oh ! so i tell you that i love you ,
and then you go outside
and stick your tongue into a teenager .
what is wrong with you , jeffrey ?
well , shirley ,
since you have clearly failed to grasp
the central insipid metaphor
of those twilight books you devour ,
let me explain it to you .
men are monsters who crave young flesh .
the end !
at least we have the decency to be ashamed of it
and keep it a secret
instead of publicly blurting , &quot; i love you , &quot;
to everyone who sleeps with us !
oh , please ! i never loved you .
aha !
i win ! i win !
i win ! in your face !
so this was all a game ?
everything they do is some sick competition .
oh , like you hate competition .
how long did it take you to kiss jeff
after i told him that i loved him ?
oh , that &apos;s right !
first vaughn , now jeff .
i better not smile at that wall outlet ,
or you &apos;ll fry your tongue off !
way to hog all the girls , jeff .
you know , when there &apos;s three sprinkle donuts ,
you don &apos;t eat one and then lick another !
anyone object to us being referred to as donuts ?
no one ?
i &apos;m sorry we can &apos;t all be
as honorable as you , troy ,
and post pierce quotes all day on twitter .
wow . is that your lame attempt to try and pass the hot seat to me ?
nice try !
wait ! i &apos;m &quot; oldwhitemansays &quot; ?
no wonder he says everything i &apos;m thinking .
you bastard .
i &apos;m just sharing what you say .
yeah ? well , what if i shared all the stuff you say ?
he thinks all dogs are boys
and all cats are girls .
there &apos;s no way to disprove that .
have you ever seen a cat penis ?
where you going ?
by the power vested in me , i now pronounce you ...
cancelled .
oh , good , yeah , abed . cancel us .
and while you &apos;re at it ,
why don &apos;t you take your cutesy ,
&quot; i can &apos;t tell life from tv &quot; gimmick with you ?
you know , it &apos;s very &quot; season one . &quot;
i can tell life from tv , jeff .
tv makes sense and has structure , logic , rules .
and likeable leading men .
in life , we have this .
we have you .
i &apos;m on the clock for another hour
if you want me to do some batman lines .
not sitting with your little group ?
the little group is done .
yeah , well ...
mission @-@ ary accomplished , right ?
what does that mean ?
come on .
i know you and britta did it .
isn &apos;t the whole reason you got together with those people
because you wanted to bang the blond ?
and now i hear that you frenched the brunette .
what more could you have gotten out of that group ?
good morning , class .
let &apos;s dive in
and hear the results of your assignment .
who wants to go first ?
i don &apos;t know , mr. winger .
the last time i called on you ,
i kinda got what the maku @-@ maku call dirt roaded .
using it !
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry about that .
it was a trick question .
the tool most important to humanity &apos;s survival
wasn &apos;t any of the nine in the box .
go on .
the most important tool is respect .
gaaaa @-@ yyyy !
and the reason i know respect is a tool
is because it is clearly not a natural thing ,
and we forget to use it all the time ,
and then we start competing with each other
and exploiting each other
and humiliating each other and controlling each other .
and we lose each other .
and without each other , we &apos;ll go extinct .
and that &apos;s a fact .
ha . gay fact .
that &apos;s my answer , professor .
well , that &apos;s one answer .
here &apos;s the one i had in mind .
combining all nine tools ,
you get this--
a deadlier weapon than any one item in the box .
so i &apos;m gonna use this to attack you
and you use respect to defend yourself .
oh , my god !
i ... respect you !
that &apos;s why you fail !
he &apos;s passing out !
oh , my god !
oh !
stay with us , buddy !
oh , thank god .
hello ! hello , jeffrey .
what happened ?
professor bauer got suspended ,
and we got an automatic &quot; a &quot; on our assignment .
did someone throw urine in my face ?
oh . sometimes i surprise myself under pressure .
jeff , about the assignment . we decided ...
you had the right answer .
i think we need a little more respect
and a little less passion .
which will be easy for me
because i think you &apos;re kinda gross now .
awesome .
pierce , i &apos;m gonna delete that twitter account .
your friendship is more important than 600,000 strangers .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
are you saying 600,000 people read what i say on twitter ?
we gotta cash in on that !
how about oldwhitemansays ... the tv show ?
no .
who would watch that ?
speaking of bad development strategy ,
i owe you all an apology .
i was trying so hard to make our first week a great one ,
i didn &apos;t realize
there was something great in front of us the whole time
an old woman drinking her own pee .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s true .
guys .
i got a confession to make-- i took anthropology
because i want to be a part of your study group .
now , i gotta do the honest thing and just ask .
is there any room in this pocket for a little spare chang ?
uh ... w @-@ we &apos;ve been through a lot today .
give us a little time to think it over .
totally , totally , man .
just think about it , take your time ,
and , uh ... let me know .
bye .
see ya .
all right .
oh ! poor guy .
oh , we &apos;ll let him in eventually .
says who ?
look , we have the strength to survive anything .
what &apos;s the worst that can happen with chang ?
that &apos;s true .
yeah .
that &apos;s a good point .
i told you they hate you .
no . they said they just needed more time .
time ? they destroyed your life !
how much time before we take revenge ?
but they &apos;re my friends .
i &apos;m your only friend !
no .
hah hah hah !
no !
ah hah hah hah !
noooooo !
kindom animalia . phylum chordata .
the class is ...
mammalia .
&apos;cause boobies we gotta
order is primate . family hominidae
but genius is ... - homo .
but you know you &apos;re into me
&apos;cause i am in the species known as sapien
dogs used to eat me , but now they bring the paper in .
it &apos;s gonna take a lot to get me away from you
damn damn .
there &apos;s nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
s @-@ s @-@ sapien
i bless the rains down in africa .
oh , bless the rain
i bless the rains down in africa .
