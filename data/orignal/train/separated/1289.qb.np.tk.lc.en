it all just happened so fast .
stay here . i don &apos;t want to spook him .
jane .
no , i know this guy well enough to know he &apos;s not bluffing .
be careful !
you know jane .
paul .
she never quits .
she was determined to talk him off the bridge .
listen to me , okay ?
you &apos;re wasting your time .
no . no .
just -- just listen .
she told him she didn &apos;t believe he killed his girlfriend .
jane , don &apos;t .
she was sure he was set up
and they needed to bring the real killer to justice .
come on .
but then he slipped .
jane !
jane !
jane ! !
i should &apos;ve stopped her .
there &apos;s nothing you could do , huh ?
still no sign of them ?
another coast guard boat joined the search .
you heard from the harbor patrol ?
they got divers in the water .
but she won &apos;t survive very long in this cold water .
i got to get on one of those boats .
no , there &apos;s nothing you can do on the water .
we need to continue coordinating the search ,
relaying information from here .
maura , did you see which way they were swimming ?
no . the current just swept them away from the bridge so fast ,
they just disappeared in the darkness .
you know the currents around here . what are their chances ?
come on , korsak .
i really need to know where we stand here .
people have gone in the water around here
and been swept right out to sea .
but they weren &apos;t jane rizzoli .
i can &apos;t believe i let her jump .
you didn &apos;t let her .
their best chance is if they were able
to swim to one of these outlying islands here .
korsak .
okay , thanks .
what is it ?
the press . they know we &apos;re searching for jane and paul ,
want to know what &apos;s going on .
prosecutor jumps off a bridge after killing his girlfriend ?
that &apos;s a front @-@ page story .
someone needs to notify paul &apos;s wife
before the press gets to her .
well , we &apos;ll stay here until they find her .
i &apos;ll be back asap .
let me know if you hear anything .
jane &apos;s a hell of a swimmer .
she could make it out to one of those islands
that korsak circled .
but what if she didn &apos;t ?
hello ?
mrs. westcourt ?
police .
mrs. westcourt ?
mrs. westcourt , i &apos;m detective korsak .
don &apos;t know if you remember me .
how could i forget ?
it &apos;s not every day
that your husband gets arrested for murder .
i &apos;m afraid i have some bad news .
your husband climbed out onto the narrows bridge .
one of our detectives got there in time , but he fell .
oh , my god .
we &apos;re doing everything we can to find him .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s any comfort ,
but we don &apos;t think paul killed danni mitchell .
so what if he didn &apos;t kill her ?
he lied , cheated , and humiliated me .
frankly , i don &apos;t give a damn if he drowns .
okay . thank you so much .
i called my friend at the , um ,
north bay marine research station .
he said fishermen caught several red drum last week ,
which is indicative of warmer currents
moving up the coast .
so , the surface temperature might be warmer
than what the coast guard thought .
yeah , it &apos;s possible .
which means she could survive longer in the water .
she just has to keep swimming to one of those islands .
if there &apos;s one thing i know about my sister ,
she won &apos;t give up .
janie will keep swimming .
hey , frankie .
yeah ?
a fisherman thinks he &apos;s spotted something .
they &apos;re checking it out .
korsak .
how long ago ?
okay . i &apos;m on my way .
excuse me .
janie !
janie !
oh , god .
come here . god .
oh . okay .
it &apos;s a good thing mom made us
take all those swimming lessons when we were kids , huh ?
you all right ?
yeah . okay .
i &apos;ve never been so happy to see you .
i &apos;ll see you back at the office .
take good care of her .
so , i think maura was scared
she was gonna lose her best friend
and probably embarrassed to be feeling that way
in front of everyone .
i &apos;m just doing my job , mom .
true .
but you always say ,
&quot; a smart cop weighs the risks for the greater good . &quot;
well , you don &apos;t forget anything , do you ?
look , i &apos;m just saying .
it &apos;s hard sometimes on the rest of us .
okay . then why aren &apos;t you upset ?
well , i &apos;m not happy that you jumped off a bridge .
but i have wasted too much time over the years
worrying about things i can &apos;t control .
it never did me any good with you or your father .
ma , you got two kids that lay their lives down every day
for other people .
when is that gonna be something you &apos;re proud of ?
jane , i &apos;m proud of you .
you &apos;re great at what you do .
i don &apos;t want to stop you from being who you are .
so i &apos;m learning to accept your job
and the way that you do it .
you back in therapy ?
yes , i am .
wh-- you &apos;re going ?
you sure you &apos;re not upset ?
no , not even a little bit .
i just got to go to the dry cleaners .
i &apos;ve got a ... big job interview coming up .
what job interview ?
i don &apos;t want to jinx it .
thanks for asking .
bye , ma .
how are you feeling ?
okay .
tired .
bruised .
it was the only thing i could afford
without taking out a second mortgage , so ...
it &apos;s my favorite .
okay .
i know jumping in after paul was dangerous .
did you think about any of us before you jumped ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t think about you .
and i didn &apos;t think about my family .
i didn &apos;t even think about myself .
the only person that i thought about was paul
and that i was the only one that could help him .
i wasn &apos;t gonna let him drown , maura .
i guess that &apos;s the instinct that makes you such a good cop .
and maybe a bit hard to love .
i was just afraid i lost you .
and i just kept thinking that i didn &apos;t do enough to help you .
i -- why didn &apos;t i go and help you talk paul down ,
or why didn &apos;t i stop you from going over the railing ?
why wasn &apos;t i closer to grab you ?
that &apos;s survivor &apos;s guilt .
excuse me ?
bpd did a seminar on it .
you went ?
i read the pamphlet .
survivor &apos;s guilt .
that makes perfect sense .
why didn &apos;t i think of that ?
well , there &apos;s a first time for everything .
maura , there was nothing you could have done
on that bridge , okay ?
that &apos;s on me .
weren &apos;t you scared ?
not until i was falling .
then , yeah , then i was petrified .
and my life flashed before my eyes and --
the weirdest thing was all i could think about
was all the stuff i still want to do .
like what ?
i don &apos;t know . um , watch the sox win another series
or go to beer @-@ brewing class or learn how to make ravioli .
really ?
you &apos;re plunging to your death
and you had ravioli and beer on your mind ?
i &apos;m a girl with simple tastes .
i think we need to work on your bucket list .
that sounds like crazy fun .
but right now we have a case to crack .
so ... what &apos;s our next step ?
susie , we have a new case -- danni mitchell .
she is a 25 @-@ year @-@ old woman
who was found dead in her apartment .
all right . either i &apos;m being punk &apos;d or you &apos;re losing it .
well , i never punk ,
and i can assure you i &apos;m in full control of my faculties .
and i can assure you that danni mitchell
is a case we started last week .
well , we &apos;re gonna start the case again this week .
so , why are we entering this parallel universe ?
paul westcourt was set up , and we took the bait .
we believed what the real killer wanted us to believe .
so we &apos;re looking at it with fresh eyes and an open mind .
i couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
now let &apos;s figure out what we missed .
still can &apos;t believe you jumped in after me .
well , i was just doing my job .
we both know that &apos;s not true .
well , trying to figure out who might want you in jail --
that &apos;s my job now .
so ... who hated you enough to do something like this ?
long list .
i burned a lot of bridges
climbing the ladder in the d.a. &apos; s office .
thanks .
no , this -- this was personal .
what about a @-@ a friend or maybe another girlfriend ?
there was never any other girlfriend .
okay .
well , somebody went after the woman you love ,
so somebody knew there was an affair .
impossible .
we were so careful to keep it secret .
the entire time ?
you never slipped up once ?
you never thought maybe somebody you knew saw you ?
only thing i can think of is one night ,
i felt like a car was following us .
it pulled into the motel behind us
and was still there when we came out .
danni thought i was being paranoid .
did you get a plate number ?
nope .
make , model ?
it was a little red , maybe burgundy , economy car .
it was dark . i -- i know .
it &apos;s not much to go on .
no , it isn &apos;t .
we &apos;re in trouble here , aren &apos;t we ?
we &apos;ll find something .
okay .
i reconfirmed paul &apos;s wife &apos;s alibi . it &apos;s solid .
phone records
have her on her cell at the time of the murder .
cell tower pings put her at home .
well , you &apos;re on the road to solid .
you &apos;re not quite there yet .
she was online playing her regular nightly chess game
with a guy in london .
i.p. address goes back to her laptop at home .
and welcome to solid .
did you find anybody else who &apos;d want to take paul down ?
mm , i &apos;ve looked at the families
of a dozen murderers that he put behind bars .
there &apos;s nothing that leads me to believe
any of them would have concocted such an elaborate plan
to get back at him .
then your revenge theory is wrong . jane .
you sure about this guy ?
how &apos;s it going ?
this case is going down faster than the titanic .
i have been looking at everyone
inside and outside the d.a &apos;s office ,
trying to see if anyone had a personal ax to grind with paul .
nothing ?
nothing out of the ordinary , no .
frankie , can you finish going through these files ?
maybe you &apos;ll have better luck
trying to find someone who wanted to frame paul .
well , i got to meet ma for lunch first .
did she say anything to you about a job interview ?
just that she had one .
she didn &apos;t want to jinx it .
why does she want to talk to me ?
just lucky , i guess .
okay , so , i &apos;ve been scouring the ads for work .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s tough out there .
nope . i found the perfect job .
but i really need you to help me .
i &apos;m not gonna threaten to give someone a parking ticket again .
no , i only want you to help me practice for my interview .
okay .
so , what &apos;s the job ?
it &apos;s a management training position
with a really , really large restaurant company .
and it comes with a great salary ,
health benefits , and a pension plan .
well , i never had a pension plan before , frankie .
ma , uh , how are you gonna get them to see
that your experience as a housewife
a @-@ and a deli worker
makes you right for a high @-@ end restaurant job ?
well , that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna show you
when we practice for my interview .
okay .
wonder what that &apos;s all about .
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is that he &apos;s invited us down here
for some kind of celebration tonight .
so , come on .
let &apos;s go .
all right .
there &apos;s like 50 questions here .
75 .
i really need to be prepared , frankie .
okay .
how does a woman with so much work experience
have such a youthful appearance ?
really ? no one &apos;s gonna ask you that .
i know . it &apos;s just a joke question .
go ahead . go to the next one .
all right .
i was thinking , we should make our own bucket lists
and share them with each other .
couldn &apos;t i just take you out for gluten @-@ free pizza ?
well , i think you owe me this .
i mean , i spent the entire night on the bridge
sure i was never going to see you again .
okay , i &apos;ll make a bucket list .
yes !
is this why you called me down here ?
no . i called you because you were right .
of course i was . about what ?
fresh eyes on danni &apos;s murder .
so i went back to paul &apos;s fingerprint ,
and i did a microanalysis on everything that was left behind .
i found soybean oil ,
vinegar , tomato puree , and sodium benzoate .
which means ?
paul likes barbecue sauce .
okay .
great news if we &apos;re planning a cookout .
it &apos;s not exactly the case @-@ breaking clue i was hoping for .
it &apos;s just the beginning .
she got a haircut .
well , that &apos;s what i thought .
but i was looking at the case file
from the first murder ,
and the victim in that case
also had long hair in her dmv photo
and short hair in her autopsy photo .
she got a haircut , too ?
well , the coincidence made me look back at danni &apos;s photo ,
and i realized that her hair was cut after she died .
so , to the trained eye ,
it &apos;s obvious that both victims &apos; hair
was not cut by a professional --
that somebody just grabbed it and lopped it off .
so , both victims had their hair cut after they were dead .
and since nobody investigating the original case noticed it ,
either danni &apos;s killer murdered both women
and paul convicted the wrong man or --
danni &apos;s killer learned that detail from the first killer .
mm ! way to go , maura .
so , you think the guy sitting in prison knows who murdered danni ?
yeah . i do .
i think we should get to him first thing tomorrow morning .
well , maybe we don &apos;t need to be so hasty .
why shouldn &apos;t we ?
i &apos;ve been over this guy &apos;s case files ,
and one thing &apos;s very clear -- he hates women .
last time i looked , you &apos;re a woman .
it &apos;s easy to see how you made detective .
i &apos;m just saying , i don &apos;t think
we &apos;re doing ourselves any favors
to put you in a room with that maniac .
i can handle him .
yeah , i can , too .
i just think it &apos;s better if i take a run at him .
all right , yeah , you don &apos;t need to convince me
to stay in bed one more hour . no problem .
what &apos;s the big mystery ?
why &apos;d you call us all down here ?
soon enough .
yeah , what &apos;s going on , vince ?
so , beers around ?
i &apos;ll have a shiraz .
how come you playing bartender ?
i &apos;m not really playing bartender .
i &apos;m just filling in for tonight .
okay . i &apos;m with frankie .
what &apos;s going on ?
after lots of discussions with kiki about my future ,
i &apos;ve decided this is my retirement plan .
it will give me a way to make money
and a place to play music in my twilight years .
i bought the place .
you &apos;re looking at the new owner of the dirty robber .
so , you keep working and we get free drinks .
how about i keep working
and i put you all on my friends and family discount plan ?
fair enough .
well , cheers .
to renaissance man , a cop , musician ,
and businessman extraordinaire .
how exciting !
hear , hear .
cheers .
cheers .
bona fortuna .
mark , i &apos;m detective korsak .
what do you want ?
to talk .
how &apos;s life in walpole treating you ?
things couldn &apos;t be better .
really ?
i heard you had a big complaint about prison life .
the room service isn &apos;t as good as i expected .
oh , and i hear the library is too small for your taste .
you &apos;ve already been through all the books .
what can i say ?
i &apos;m a voracious reader .
that why i brought you a bagful .
what do i have to do ?
answer a few questions .
what do you want to know ?
we found out you chopped your victim &apos;s hair off
for a trophy .
why go back and look at my case ?
i &apos;m investigating a murder that was carried out the same way .
did you have an accomplice
that knew you cut your victim &apos;s hair ?
the librarian told me that you like war history .
this book won the booker prize last year .
there was no accomplice .
well , somebody knew what you did with the hair
because they copied every detail of your crime .
i had a pen pal .
i &apos;m gonna need a little bit more than that .
this chick -- she sent me a bunch of letters .
she said she liked me ,
and eventually , i let her come and visit .
she said she couldn &apos;t stand seeing me locked up .
she hated the prosecutor and she wanted to avenge
what he did to me , so i gave her a tutorial .
what &apos;s her name ?
sarah daniels .
thank you .
we had a deal .
info for books .
you &apos;ll like this one .
&quot; the feminine mystique &quot; by betty friedan .
hey , dr. isles .
nina , hello .
jane asked me to pick up mark talbot &apos;s prison letters
tf you &apos;re done analyzing them .
we are finished with the letters .
we didn &apos;t find anything helpful .
but susie is still working on the envelopes .
i &apos;ll let her know .
so , how &apos;s bpd treating you ?
i love it .
kind of feel like i &apos;ve finally found a home .
and you &apos;re from chicago , right ?
born and raised .
so how &apos;d you end you here ?
um , it &apos;s a long story .
are you okay ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
it &apos;s not you .
it &apos;s the 14 @-@ year @-@ old kid
who killed my boyfriend to get in a gang .
i &apos;m sorry .
is that why you left chicago pd ?
my beat was overrun with gangs .
i made sure the middle @-@ school kids
on their way home were safe , and they were .
i had their backs .
marcus was a teacher at that middle school .
the boy who shot him was a student ,
killed him in his classroom .
i couldn &apos;t protect the person i loved most .
i &apos;m really sorry that i brought it up .
oh , i &apos;m glad you asked .
it was kind of strange
not having anyone around here who knew .
excuse me .
it &apos;s so nice you &apos;re here .
thank you , i guess .
i just mean i am really nervous
and i wish my mom had come to the interview with me
like you have .
which one is your daughter ?
angela rizzoli ?
you &apos;re next up .
ah , the warden sent you
all of mark &apos;s jailhouse correspondence .
yeah . crime lab just finished all the letters .
i reviewed all the prison security video ,
pulled some stills .
she always wore a hat and glasses .
she knew exactly where the cameras were
and how to avoid them .
sarah daniels &apos; last address was
in south boston on dorchester .
well , we need to pick her up .
uniforms are already bringing her in .
hi . barry martin .
hi . angela rizzoli .
hi . very nice to meet you .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
i &apos;m too old .
but , mr. martin , i &apos;ve got something
none of those lovely young girls in your waiting room have ,
and that &apos;s real @-@ life experience .
everyone brings something unique to the party .
well , i m glad you said that .
what makes me unique is all the things that i bring .
i &apos;ve raised three children who turned out amazingly well .
well , actually , one has had his struggles .
i managed my husband &apos;s plumbing company for over 20 years .
and a couple of years ago ,
i went back to work in the restaurant business .
i see you worked at the , uh , division 1 cafe .
well , i didn &apos;t just work there .
i was the cafe &apos;s cook ,
waitress , manager , dishwasher ,
and occasional bouncer .
that actually all sounds good .
i &apos;m a hard worker , mr. martin .
and i &apos;m really good with people .
and i -- well , i would like to work with you .
and if you give me this opportunity ,
i won &apos;t let you down .
look , i @-@ i can see
there are a lot of really good candidates for this job .
but in my book ,
age and experience trumps youth every single time .
your age is not even a consideration .
really ?
really .
officers said they put sarah daniels in here .
what is it that you think i &apos;ve done ?
i &apos;ve been in a wheelchair since i was 16 .
i was paralyzed from the waist down
in a high @-@ school gymnastics accident .
your driver &apos;s license was used in a prison visiting office .
uh , w @-@ was it about three months ago ?
yeah . how &apos;d you know ?
that was about the time i lost my wallet .
you remember where you were when you lost it ?
uh , i &apos;d only been to two places that day --
uh , a post office on wilton
and my physical therapist &apos;s office
at 120 broad street .
i went back , but i couldn &apos;t find it .
what else was in the wallet ?
a few credit cards ,
dry @-@ cleaning receipt , and a little cash .
did they ever try to use the credit cards ?
no .
um ... do you by chance recognize the woman that stole your i.d. ?
uh , based on this photo , i @-@ it could be anyone .
i can &apos;t find any connection between sarah daniels
and anyone involved in this case .
well , maybe she was targeted by the murderer
because they both look alike .
i hope so because if this is random ,
it could be like looking for a needle in a haystack .
what are you gonna tell paul ?
that we &apos;re knee @-@ deep in a very big haystack .
what &apos;s going on ?
we thought we had the murderer
and i wanted to see if you knew her ,
but it turns out she didn &apos;t do it .
tell me there &apos;s at least
a glimmer of light at the end of this tunnel .
okay .
we know that danni &apos;s killer is a woman .
we know that she got into the prison
with an i.d. that she stole somewhere around 120 broad street .
we know ...
does that area mean something to you ?
no . i @-@ i mean , it &apos;s around the corner from my office ,
so i was just thinking i must pass by there almost every day .
is there anything else you found ?
what about the red car ?
any luck ?
we checked with the hotel .
we looked at security cameras in the area .
nothing turned up .
paul , i know it looks dark .
but we &apos;re not giving up .
what do you got ?
i lifted a partial print from one of the envelopes .
you get an i.d. ?
no , but it contained the same barbecue @-@ sauce residue
as paul &apos;s print from the toilet handle .
so , either they both love soul food ...
or they shared a meal together .
mm @-@ hmm . that &apos;s what i was thinking .
well , maybe i overlooked someone from paul &apos;s office .
like a staff member or a coworker .
um , any clues from the letters ?
they reveal someone intelligent ,
probably college @-@ educated .
she &apos;s clever , manipulative ,
and a woman who &apos;s clearly disturbed and frustrated .
you just described how i feel about this case .
this was just delivered for you at the front desk .
ooh , thank you , susie .
enjoy .
what &apos;s in the box ?
a gift for you .
why did you get me a gift ?
because i realize that we need to live every day to its fullest ,
so i got you something from our bucket list .
how could we have the same thing on our bucket list ?
you said mine was stupid .
i don &apos;t believe i ever used the word &quot; stupid . &quot;
well , you said i need a new bucket list .
i merely suggested that revisiting the list
would reveal some more exciting choices .
well , let &apos;s open it .
oh -- okay .
later .
why later ?
you &apos;ll see .
how &apos;d it go with the job ?
yeah , well , the interview went well .
yeah ?
i didn &apos;t get the job
because they wanted somebody with a college degree .
oh , ma .
i &apos;m so sorry .
well , it &apos;s okay .
but i appreciate all your help , frankie .
thank you .
hey , i &apos;m proud of you , how you went after that job .
and let me tell you something .
no college degree is gonna compete
with the phd you have in a life well @-@ lived .
thank you .
you got this close on your first try .
who &apos;s to say you won &apos;t get the next one ?
yeah , there &apos;s got to be an employer out there
that will appreciate my life experience .
you &apos;re darn right there is .
okay , so , uh , when i find that job ,
are you still willing to help me ?
absolutely .
ma , of course .
i heard the barbecue sauce in both prints matched .
yeah , we talked to paul .
he said the last time he ate barbecue
was at a fundraiser at city hall about a week before the murder .
we talked to his secretary .
she gave us the guest list .
turn up any new suspects ?
yeah .
paul &apos;s wife , carol , was at the event with him .
i &apos;m not sure that makes her a prime suspect .
not by itself .
we also asked the secretary if the building at 120 broadstreet
meant anything to her .
she said she remembered
that &apos;s where carol went to the psychiatrist once a week .
sarah daniels and the wife
saw doctors in the same building .
yeah , kind of more than a coincidence .
you think that that &apos;s where she stole sarah &apos;s i.d.
here &apos;s why .
they could be sisters .
got her .
i ran carol &apos;s credit cards .
she rented a car several months ago .
rental agreement says it &apos;s a small , red economy car ,
just like the one that paul thought was following him .
so she knew about the affair before we did .
yeah , which gives her plenty of motive ,
gives her lots of time to plan this murder .
it &apos;s a great theory ,
except carol was home the night of the murder .
yeah , there &apos;s that .
paul &apos;s wife , carol , is our prime suspect .
well , that explains the barbecue sauce .
we think she found out paul was having an affair
yeah , but our biggest problem
is that we don &apos;t have any forensic evidence
to tie her to the crime scene and we can &apos;t crack her alibi .
yeah , she claims she was at home playing online chess .
nina , can you play the recording of carol &apos;s chess game ?
we think that she had someone play chess for her at home ,
but we don &apos;t know how to prove it .
how long did the match last ?
over an hour .
pawn takes d @-@ 5 .
right on the money . great .
i knew you loved chess ,
but i didn &apos;t know you were clairvoyant .
how did you do that ?
the moves are boris spassky
versus bobby fischer , 1970 .
nina , can you fast @-@ forward to her next move ?
pawn to e @-@ 4 .
i could do this all day .
again .
pawn takes c @-@ 3 .
okay , now you &apos;re just showing off .
i am .
but , you know , she &apos;s following spassky &apos;s moves to a &quot; t. &quot;
wait a minute . her opponent &apos;s moves play out randomly .
but carol &apos;s moves happen exactly 30 seconds
after her opponent moves .
she just wanted to keep the game going and credible .
so she took spassky &apos;s playbook
and preprogrammed the computer
to play the game automatically .
bye @-@ bye , alibi .
later , later , perpetrator .
your wife &apos;s known about the affair for months .
no .
it &apos;s not possible .
she rented a small , red economy car
just like the one you thought was following you and danni
to the hotel a while back .
what i can &apos;t figure out is why you didn &apos;t say anything
when i told you about the driver &apos;s license
that was stolen at 120 broadstreet ,
since your wife goes there once a week to see her shrink .
i was hoping it was a coincidence .
come on , paul . you &apos;re smarter than that .
i just didn &apos;t want it to be true .
i &apos;m the one who lied , cheated .
the way i handled this , i ... i didn &apos;t want it
to be the reason that the woman i loved was dead .
have you told your wife about your suspicions ?
no .
well , that &apos;s the first smart thing you &apos;ve done so far .
i just need five minutes .
leave me alone .
please , carol .
there &apos;s nothing left to say .
look , i know i handled this the wrong way and i &apos;m sorry !
i &apos;m sorry .
how could you do it ?
how could you just throw away our life together ,
everything we built ?
the future that we planned --
didn &apos;t it mean anything to you ?
didn &apos;t i mean anything to you ?
of course you did .
then how could you turn your back on me for her ?
how does it go so wrong
between two people who love each other so much ?
you &apos;re asking a guy who was married three times .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt you .
did you ever have this conversation ?
no , but i never cheated on any of my wives .
but i wasn &apos;t emotionally available , either .
emotionally avail--
when did you start watching &quot; dr. phil &quot; ?
that would be never .
but kiki helped me understand
that my deepest emotional fulfillment came from work .
i often wonder if i could have balanced a career
and a marriage to casey .
that &apos;s something you would have had to work on together .
i think kiki would point out
that casey &apos;s own issues with marriage and career
complicated the relationship .
i &apos;m so sorry i hurt you , carol .
i think i &apos;d like your kiki .
pretty extraordinary woman .
what &apos;s the deal between you two ?
is she becoming more than a life coach ?
oh , kiki has a strict rule against dating clients .
well , i think it &apos;s time you fired kiki .
i can &apos;t hear what they &apos;re saying .
well , that can &apos;t be good .
this is your way of turning it all back on me .
you have to play the good guy so you don &apos;t feel so bad
about running away with that filthy whore .
she got what she deserved .
you disgust me .
i put a bag over her head ,
and i squeezed it tight
and i watched the life drain from her body .
and i felt fantastic .
enough !
enough , carol !
i &apos;ve lived with a prosecutor for 15 years .
i know you &apos;re wearing a wire .
no !
don &apos;t you move !
paul , listen to me .
come on . i jumped off a bridge
because i did not believe that you were a murderer .
please don &apos;t prove me wrong . please .
think about danielle .
just -- think about danielle , okay ?
she wouldn &apos;t want this .
she loved you so much .
she wouldn &apos;t want this . come on .
if she were here right now ,
she -- she would be begging for you to put that gun down .
please , paul .
please -- please put it down .
please . it &apos;s not worth it .
it &apos;s not worth it .
what a tragedy .
it just reminds us
that there are consequences to our actions .
yeah , but i &apos;m not sure i &apos;ll ever understand
how two people can start out in love
and then end up doing such terrible things to each other .
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
okay .
i came over here for more than just food .
really ?
maura !
please , can we open my gift now ?
it &apos;s right in front of you .
oh , it &apos;s a ... shiny kitchen thingy .
it &apos;s a pasta maker .
really ?
yes . you said you wanted to learn
how to make homemade ravioli .
thank you .
i &apos;ll roll out the dough ,
and then you can put it through the machine .
all right .
and for our stuffing , i got us lobster , duck ,
chanterelle mushrooms ,
and your favorite , sausage and ricotta cheese .
yum . mmm .
so , did you bring your bucket list ?
yes .
but i know you &apos;re gonna make fun of it .
oh , no , i &apos;m not .
i may have some constructive criticism , but ...
there you go . there &apos;s mine .
wow . and you typed it .
mm . well , these are rather interesting .
the first thing on your list is to do something from my list .
yeah , that &apos;s why we &apos;re making homemade ravioli .
i think it will be fun
to do stuff from each other &apos;s list .
really ?
no ! i &apos;m not going to paris fashion week .
i can &apos;t believe that you want to do navy seal training .
oh , okay .

and they put civilians through hell week .
