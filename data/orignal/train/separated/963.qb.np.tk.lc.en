victor made himself perfectly clear . &lt; / i &gt;
whenever i &apos;ve truly wanted something , i &apos;ve always gotten it .
bree needed to get away . &lt; / i &gt;
we &apos;re finally taking our honeymoon .
susan couldn &apos;t wait to pop the question . &lt; / i &gt;
will you marry me ?
lynette received shocking news . &lt; / i &gt;
you can see this . it could be lymphoma .
why are you reluctant to make a commit to me ?
because i &apos;m not in love with you .
edie ... &lt; / i &gt;
what if we tried to have a baby ?
engaged in a dangerous deception . &lt; / i &gt;
when gabrielle solis agreed to marry victor lang , &lt; / i &gt;
she was determined to have a very traditional wedding . &lt; / i &gt;
she was even more determined to be a very traditional bride . &lt; / i &gt;
to that end , the handkerchief in her cleavage was borrowed , &lt; / i &gt;
the garter on her leg was blue &lt; / i &gt;
and the diamonds on her ears were old . &lt; / i &gt;
but sadly for gabrielle , something was missing . &lt; / i &gt;
and she was about to throw a traditional fit . &lt; / i &gt;
it is after three !
where the hell is bree with my something new ?
i know her plane landed on time .
she &apos;ll probably be here any second .
i should have my head examined for agreeing to this .
who the hell cares about swiss jewelry anyway ?
gabby , bree went out of her way to buy you that bracelet .
of course it &apos;s the hottest day of the year .
all the guests are out there sweating like pigs .
on this rate , my reception &apos;s going to look like
the finish line of the boston marathon .
if you &apos;re that freaked out , get married without the bracelet .
are you out of your mind ?
can &apos;t get married without my &quot; something new . &quot;
oh , i have an idea . i just got a lipstick yesterday .
you could wear that .
i just paid a makeup artist 500 bucks to do my face .
do you think i want to march down the aisle
looking like i ate a popsicle ?
ok , it &apos;s your big day , so i &apos;m gonna let that slide .
god , it is ten after , and bree is never late !
where can she be ?
all right , that &apos;s it .
after i finish zhuzhing my hair ,
tell the preacher it &apos;s showtime .
i can &apos;t believe my wedding &apos;s already ruined
and it hasn &apos;t even started .
i am starting to get worried about bree .
maybe we should call .
yeah , i &apos;m calling her cell .
it &apos;s ringing .
oh , good .
bree !
hello , ladies .
is that bree ?
she better not have come empty @-@ handed .
oh , i didn &apos;t .
as promised , bree had arrived with something new . &lt; / i &gt;
holy crap .
and she also ... brought the bracelet . &lt; / i &gt;
family . there is nothing more important . &lt; / i &gt;
they are the ones we want to laugh with &lt; / i &gt;
during the good times . &lt; / i &gt;
and the ones we need to console us during the bad . &lt; / i &gt;
and even though the time comes &lt; / i &gt;
when they have to leave us ... &lt; / i &gt;
... their voices still linger in our minds . &lt; / i &gt;
and , sometimes , we can &apos;t help but listen . &lt; / i &gt;
tangled web . that &apos;s what you &apos;re weaving .
oh , beat it , mother .
really think this scheme of yours is gonna work ?
of course it will . look at him .
he &apos;s practically in love with me already .
that &apos;s because he thinks you &apos;re gonna give him a baby .
wait till he finds out you &apos;re still on the pill .
shut up , would you ?
i just thank the good lord your father didn &apos;t live to see this .
well , neither did you !
you died alone in a trailer park watching game shows .
and why should i listen to you ?
&apos;cause i know what &apos;s waiting for you , missy .
this one &apos;s gonna leave you like all the others .
you &apos;re going to end up old and alone , just like i did .
carlos ? carlos !
down here , babe !
i &apos;m making you a fruit smoothie .
chicken or fish ?
what ?
i haven &apos;t gotten your reply card . chicken or fish ?
oh , right , your wedding . i can &apos;t go .
why not ?
i &apos;m a jinx . look how your last marriage turned out .
come on , gabby , we both know it &apos;d be weird if i went .
ok , maybe a little . but it &apos;ll be weirder if you don &apos;t .
excuse me ?
look , everyone knows you living with edie .
if she shows up alone ,
people &apos;ll think i asked her not to bring you ,
like it bugs me you guys are together .
well it does . but , you hit the roof when you found out .
which is why i have to show people that i &apos;m ok with it !
please . just consider it my wedding gift .
ok . but i &apos;m skipping the ceremony .
what ? and just go to the reception ? you can &apos;t do that !
well , i don &apos;t want to make a scene .
you &apos;ll vow &quot; till death do us part , &quot; i &apos;ll bust out laughing ,
people will stare ...
the reception starts at four .
i &apos;m thinking a chocolate fountain would
be a cool centerpiece to a dessert buffet .
dessert buffet ? we &apos;re having a wedding cake , right ?
isn &apos;t that dessert ?
you have to give people a choice .
don &apos;t you think a chocolate fountain &apos;d be elegant ?
i don &apos;t know . you , a big white dress , melted chocolate .
am i the only one hearing alarm bells ?
fine , we &apos;ll skip the chocolate .
how about a champagne fountain ?
oh , i know .
we can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture .
don &apos;t you think we might be going over the top ?
mike , these are all fairly standard wedding features .
now you name one thing that you think is going over the top .
how about the dove wrangler ?
the doves are not going to release themselves .
do we really need 40 of them ?
ok , i know that you think that i &apos;m being silly ,
but all of our friends went to bree &apos;s wedding ,
and now gabby &apos;s . two months from now ,
do we want them thinking ours wasn &apos;t as nice ?
it seems to me our friends wouldn &apos;t be there to make
petty comparisons .
they &apos;d be there to celebrate our love .
you would think that , but no .
come on , this is something that
we have both looked forward to for so long .
don &apos;t you want it to be perfect ?
oh , i guess . about the doves , though .
what ?
you in a wedding gown , 40 birds circling overhead ?
again , not liking those odds .
oh , it &apos;s not as bad as it sounds .
it &apos;s hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma
and , apparently , if you &apos;re going to get lymphoma ,
that &apos;s the kind you want .
hey , you want to hold it down up there , kids ?
i &apos;m trying to talk to your aunt lucy ! thank you .
anyway , i know i said that
we would come and visit you this june ,
but i &apos;ll be a little woozy and bald from the chemo , so ...
oh , thanks for understanding . oh , one more thing .
our insurance policy has a really high deductible ,
so we are strapped financially ,
and i was wondering if maybe you and dave
might be able to ...
oh , really ?
no , i am not asking mom .
she doesn &apos;t know about any of this ,
so don &apos;t you tell her , ok ?
we &apos;ll be fine . i love you . bye .
i take it that &apos;s a no on the loan .
yep , dave lost his job at the plant ,
and he is now handing out fliers
at a chicken restaurant and , prepare to wince ,
there is a chicken suit involved .
where are we gonna find this $ 10,000 ?
you leave that to me .
i want you to focus on getting better .
but honey ...
i will find it .
meanwhile , we &apos;ll make some sacrifices around here .
my tennis club membership is up this month .
i &apos;m not renewing .
should you be playing tennis after your back surgery ?
probably not .
well , in that spirit ,
as soon as i start chemo , i will be giving up shampoo .
ok , thanks . taxi &apos;s here .
are you sure you &apos;re ready to go back ?
we could wait another week .
and miss gabby &apos;s wedding ? no , i &apos;ll be fine .
is this the dress you were thinking for the ceremony ?
yes .
oh , good . i &apos;ll fold it in tissue so it doesn &apos;t wrinkle .
oh , darling . i don &apos;t deserve you .
oh , come on , we agreed , no more tears .
i &apos;m so sorry to be putting you through this .
i wouldn &apos;t blame you if you ran like hell
and never looked back .
stop .
i &apos;m going to raise this child and love it as if it were my own .
now , let &apos;s see a smile .
glad you could join us , milton .
it &apos;s good to get to know you before the wedding .
thank you . you know , i must say ,
all these months ,
i thought victor was exaggerating about you
but he hasn &apos;t done you justice .
you , my dear , are a flawless beauty .
i &apos;m hardly flawless .
i &apos;m sure i have a blemish hidden away somewhere .
that &apos;s a search i &apos;d relish .
she is way out of your league , dad .
honey , he &apos;s a multimillionaire .
he runs my league .
by the way , victor lang , i ran into keith perkinson last week .
how is the venerable state chairman ?
impressed with you .
he liked the way you ran your mayor campaign .
said if you keep your numbers up ,
he might consider supporting you
in the next governor &apos;s race .
really ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding , right ?
i mean , we just finished a campaign .
you &apos;re not about to put me through another one .
but i thought you loved campaigning .
god , no . it &apos;s a complete snore .
pasting a smile on my face
while you say the same speech for the 50th time .
but you were a natural . people loved you .
well , the feeling wasn &apos;t mutual .
you think i enjoyed sipping tea with these
frumpy matrons who wore loud poly @-@ blend pantsuits ?
do you know how many times i wanted to scream ,
&quot; vote for my husband , you colorblind cow ! &quot;
i think you &apos;ve discovered something
very important about democracy .
the nation is full of fools , and everyone gets a vote .
they &apos;re not gonna get us again .
i made nice with fairview ,
i &apos;m not about to suck up to the whole damn state .
what are you doing ?
some guy out in mount pleasant &apos;s
got a cracked water heater .
it &apos;s three in the morning .
well , i started advertising as a 24 @-@ hour plumber .
after midnight , i get triple time .
ok , that &apos;s crazy .
you can &apos;t work around the clock . it &apos;s not healthy .
this is the third night i &apos;ve worked this week .
i &apos;m fine so far .
you &apos;ve been sneaking out while i &apos;ve been asleep ?
what are you , ninja plumber ?
it &apos;s just for a little while , to earn some extra money .
is this about the wedding ?
we agreed we want it to be nice .
but we didn &apos;t agree on this .
maybe i can scale things back a bit .
how ? have a ginger ale fountain ?
make paper doves and hope it &apos;s windy ?
ok , seriously , you don &apos;t have to kill yourself .
i could max out my credit card .
is that really how you want to start our life together , in debt ?
no , i want to start out happy .
but clearly , you &apos;re upset , and i don &apos;t know why .
i &apos;m not ian .
i can &apos;t afford to move you into a mansion
or fly you off to paris .
but i &apos;ll be damned if i don &apos;t give you
the same dream wedding he &apos;d have given you .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
where the hell do you get off having cancer
and not telling me about it ?
mom .
how do you think you could handle this without me ?
stella ?
oh , there &apos;s my tommy @-@ boy . come here .
oh , god .
oh , listen , be a love , will you , honey ,
and get my bags from the cab .
bags ? she &apos;s staying ?
yep . and do not tip the driver . sob wouldn &apos;t let me smoke .
jeez , lynette , i didn &apos;t know you opened a daycare center .
hey , kids , grandma &apos;s here .
ok , what did you tell them about me ?
it &apos;s been five years , mom . they don &apos;t remember you .
they &apos;ll remember me this time , i brought presents .
cool !
for you , and you and you .
these are baby toys . we &apos;re too old to play with these .
i &apos;m too old to remember what the hell six @-@ year @-@ olds like .
we &apos;re eight !
what do i care ?
just say &quot; thank you . &quot;
thank you .
oh , who &apos;s the pretty thing ? your girlfriend ?
no ! she &apos;s my sister !
is that tom &apos;s little b @-@ a @-@ s @-@ t @-@ a ... ?
ok , kids ! time to get your toys and play upstairs .
come on , sweetie .
let &apos;s go , everybody .
listen , i really appreciate you coming to help ,
but as you can see , i &apos;m perfectly fine .
for now .
how are you gonna handle that mob
when you &apos;re flat on your ass from chemo ?
i &apos;ll manage .
you got through breast cancer
while raising the three of us alone .
i was not alone . i had you .
lynette was all of 13 , and she still looked after her sisters ,
cleaned the house , cooked the meals ,
and i was curled up in a ball ,
puking my guts out .
that &apos;s what you get when you mix chemo and vodka gimlets .
you can goad me all you like , lynette .
i did not come here to fight .
now trust me , cookie .
i have memorized the whole catalogue of subjects
you and i can no longer discuss .
if that means that
we have to talkabout the weather for three months , then fine .
but i am staying .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
i have to go kick a child out of its room .
ok , legs up .
oh , you want to do it again ?
no . i &apos;ve been doing a lot of research ,
and gravity helps facilitate the sperm reaching the eggs .
so heave @-@ ho !
could we try a little light spooning
before you hang me like a side of beef ?
edie , we &apos;re trying to have a baby .
well , could we be a little less clinical ?
maybe let nature take its course .
nature is not on our side anymore .
you &apos;re no spring chicken
and those eggs aren &apos;t exactly farm fresh .
ok , stop referring to me as poultry !
sorry . can we just try this ? it &apos;s only for 30 minutes .
30 minutes ! i am not staying in this position for half an hour !
listen , i know that this requires some work ,
but it will all be worth it
when we have our beautiful , beautiful baby , right ?
right . i guess i could make some sacrifices .
that &apos;s my girl .
can i get you anything ?
yeah , i &apos;d kill for a beer .
sorry . no alcohol .
what ? for how long ?
just until the baby &apos;s born . oh , and you stop nursing .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll get you a nice herbal tea .
just for a few months , while you &apos;re in treatment .
we &apos;re gonna have to find someone to watch the kids .
no ! i am not leaving that woman in charge of our children .
in three months , the twins will be chain @-@ smoking
and penny will be an alcoholic .
we can manage . we &apos;ve got mccluskey .
she costs money . money we won &apos;t have
if we pay someone to replace you at work .
you said not to worry about money ,
you &apos;d find it somewhere .
i did .
what ? someone loaned us $ 10,000 ?
no , gave us . and we can &apos;t thank her by kicking her out .
no ! tom , you didn &apos;t ask my mother !
didn &apos;t have to .
she knew that you hit up lucy , so she offered .
well , we &apos;re giving it back .
no , we can &apos;t afford to .
tom , you don &apos;t know half the stuff she did to us .
she would get drunk and smack us around .
she would meet some new guy ,
and then drop us off at her sister &apos;s for a week
for a week because he wasn &apos;t into kids .
ok , so she was a crappy mom .
you said yourself that she has mellowed .
now she wants to make amends .
if you would just try to understand .
i think that i &apos;ve been pretty understanding lately .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i think you know .
great , so in the middle of everything i &apos;m dealing with ,
you &apos;re gonna throw rick in my face ?
when someone we love hurts us , if we still love them ,
we deal with it and we move on .
if i can do it , so can you .
so forgiving my mother , that &apos;s my penance ?
yeah . i think it is .
you said we weren &apos;t supposed to spend
the night before the wedding together .
yeah , i was trying to respect tradition ,
but i got horny .
i guess we &apos;ll have to start the honeymoon early , won &apos;t we ?
let me get rid of this stuff .
what are you working on so late ?
nothing .
polling data ? why are you polling ? the election &apos;s over .
just a little research . god , you look hot .
is this about running for governor ?
beacause i told you how i feel about that .
my dad just set up a little exploratory committee .
it &apos;s no big deal .
ok , let &apos;s explore it now .
nope . not gonna happen .
gabby .
victor , ever since we met ,
it &apos;s been photo ops and fundraisers ,
and i &apos;m sick of it !
i &apos;m a politician .
do you think i want my career
to begin and end in the suburbs ?
fairview &apos;s home . don &apos;t want to leave it !
you can &apos;t make this decision without me !
i &apos;m gonna be your wife .
exactly ! not my career advisor .
i don &apos;t even get a vote ?
not if it &apos;s a veto !
ok , look , no !
i already married a man who put his career before me ,
and i swore i wasn &apos;t going to again .
i swore i would not let a stupid woman hold me back !
that did not come out the way i wanted it to .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sor ... i &apos;m really sorry .
i &apos;ve been under a lot of pressure lately .
well , here &apos;s one less thing you have to worry about :
our wedding .
you can &apos;t cancel the wedding . it &apos;s too late .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s just in the nick of time .
good morning , gabby .
god , milton , the newspaper &apos;s not even here yet .
i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s so early . i just came to apologize .
why ? what happened wasn &apos;t your fault .
that &apos;s not exactly the case .
is that coffee i smell ?
you only bolted because victor wants to be governor .
he only wants to be governor because of me .
you only suggested it .
you can &apos;t make him go after something he doesn &apos;t want .
the hell i can &apos;t .
ever since he was a kid , victor &apos;s been killing himself
trying to live up to his big @-@ shot father .
he &apos;s desperate for my approval .
why ?
i suppose because he &apos;s never gotten it .
everything he does , even becoming mayor ,
i somehow let him know that it &apos;s not quite enough .
oh , don &apos;t get me wrong , i &apos;m right to push .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s so successful .
so , what are you saying ,
i should marry victor because you &apos;re a withholding father ?
no , i just want you to understand why he does what he does .
fine . i get it . but why would i want a husband who values
his father &apos;s opinion more than mine ?
well , he doesn &apos;t really care much what i think anymore .
after you left last night he called me and , what &apos;s the phrase ,
&quot; tore me a new one . &quot;
he did ?
he said , because of me ,
he &apos;d lost the best thing that had ever happened to him .
and if he couldn &apos;t win you back ,
i could take my money and buy a new son
because i was never going to be hearing from him again .
he blew off 80 million ?
well , if he cares about me so damn much ,
why am i not hearing this from him ?
i think you &apos;re about to .
is there a back way out of here ?
aren &apos;t you going to be late for gabby &apos;s wedding ?
oh , weddings are boring . i like to sneak in at the end ,
look teary @-@ eyed and pretend i was there the whole time .
i am going to see you at the reception .
oh ! uh , hi , danny .
carlos , the paper boy &apos;s here ! could you pay him ?
come on in .
hey . here you go , danny .
oh , looks like i &apos;m a little short .
can i catch you later ?
no .
all right , hold on .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s birth control pills .
i &apos;m gonna need cash .
welcome home .
i have missed you , sweetheart .
here , allow me .
well , hello there , julie .
you guys are back !
wow , somebody &apos;s blonder .
oh , yeah , my mom hates it too .
so where &apos;s danielle ?
well , while we were in switzerland
she ran across this boarding school .
she fell in love with it and just insisted that we
let her spend a year abroad .
she must be having a good time .
she hasn &apos;t returned any of my phone calls .
oh , well , you know , her school &apos;s up in the mountains
and her cell phone reception is kind of funky .
she hasn &apos;t answered my e @-@ mails either .
i am going to call her tonight and have a little talk with her
about common courtesy and i &apos;m sure that you &apos;ll get
an e @-@ mail tomorrow morning .
well , we should go .
got to get that bracelet to gabby before the wedding .
well , i &apos;ll see you guys there . bye .
well , that was uncomfortable .
you have no idea .
everyone &apos;s been asking questions .
this might not be as easy as we &apos;d hoped .
there . now you have something new .
so how do i look ?
you are now , officially ,
the most beautiful bride that ever lived .
until your wedding , of course .
nice save .
it means so much to me that
we &apos;re all here together right now .
and break !
love you .
we are gathered here today to join together ...
... victor lang and gabrielle marquez in matrimony .
an honorable estate not to be entered into lightly ,
but reverently and soberly .
this is a lifetime union , based on love , honor , and trust .
do you wanna be my new best friend .
premium scotch . keep it coming .
you are promising not only to give it to yourself ,
but also to accept each other
promising not only to love for today , but to extend that love ..
carlos ! i thought you weren &apos;t coming until ...
save it !
ok , look , i can explain .
don &apos;t bother !
your lies were more convincing when i cared .
carlos ! you &apos;ve got to understand !
i do want to have a baby with you , just not yet !
i just wanted to give you a chance to fall in love with me first .
i don &apos;t believe you . and i will never trust you again .
well , what was i supposed to do ?
you backed me into a corner !
and you were gonna bail on us .
i was just trying to save what we had !
carlos , don &apos;t leave me .
please just talk to me .
i am done with you .
carlos !
ladies and gentlemen , i present to you ,
mr. and mrs. victor lang !
i &apos;m sorry !
mrs. mccluskey . enjoy the wedding ?
nice . very classy .
what the hell was that brouhaha between carlos and edie ?
i don &apos;t know and i don &apos;t care .
today i am so filled with love , i can forgive anyone anything .
oh , but if you do see them again , call security .
so we &apos;re in zuich and i am sick after breakfast
for the third morning in a row . i thought to myself , &quot; dear god ,
&quot; i hope i haven &apos;t developed an allergy to chocolate brioche . &quot;
&quot; life wouldn &apos;t be worth living . &quot;
i said , &quot; that &apos;s it , we &apos;re seeing a doctor . &quot;
you could &apos;ve knocked us over with a feather when he said
she was two months pregnant .
i think it &apos;s so great and we could not be happier for you .
when &apos;s your due date ?
not until the early fall ,
but enough about me . this is your day . you and victor .
who , by the way , i have not met yet .
my gosh , that &apos;s right .
ok , you stay here , i &apos;m going to go grab him .
it &apos;s so good to be back .
i can &apos;t believe how much is happening .
i mean , you and gabby getting married ,
and i &apos;m having a baby .
what &apos;s going on with you , lynette ?
nothing . same old , same old .
really ? everything ok , sweetie ?
you haven &apos;t seemed yourself the last couple weeks .
i &apos;m fine . everything &apos;s just fine .
i &apos;ll tell you this much , i &apos;m exhausted .
i &apos;ll be glad when this day &apos;s over .
well , it was all worth it .
marrying gabby is the smartest thing you &apos;ve ever done .
her bringing the latino vote ,
the governor &apos;s mansion &apos;s yours .
well , that &apos;s assuming i can change her mind .
had to make concessions to get her down the aisle .
well , you &apos;re the husband now . the rules have changed .
be nice , buy her a few pretty things .
trust me , you &apos;ll be able to tame that little spitfire .
not worried . i &apos;ve always been able to manage my assets .
did you find him ?
no . i &apos;m still looking , but i &apos;ll let you know .
movie &apos;s over , amen .
go out and play . go on . out .
they &apos;re just gonna go play guns .
can i watch another movie ?
lynette said one was the limit and she &apos;ll be home soon .
no , she won &apos;t .
whenever they go out to a party
they always come home at least an hour later
than they say they will .
aren &apos;t you an observant little monkey .
tell me , sweetie ,
would you know anything about a man named rick ?
yeah , i know rick .
my daddy and lynette had a big fight about him .
really ?
sounds like there &apos;s , maybe , a little story there .
if i tell you , could i watch a really good grown @-@ up movie ?
if it &apos;s a really good grown @-@ up story .
ok , i got you some appetizers to tide you over .
we have mini @-@ quiches and beef satay
and something called crystal coast shrimp with grits ,
but it &apos;s mostly grits
because i ate all the shrimp on my way over .
mike ?
reverend , that was such a beautiful ceremony .
really just heartfelt and moving . the whole package .
well , thank you .
it was really impressive .
so , what are you doing tonight ?
carlos . i didn &apos;t know you were in here .
i got a little thirsty .
yes , i can see that .
gaby , i am sorry if i ruined your wedding .
but if it &apos;s any consolation , i also ruined my life .
what are you talking about ?
a couple years ago i was totally happy .
i had a home , you , a great career .
and i don &apos;t understand how i let it all go to hell .
and now , here i am , back at square one .
i really blew it .
what am i doing ?
i shouldn &apos;t be dumping this on you .
it &apos;s your wedding day . go to victor .
i &apos;m going to stay right here ...
well , i don &apos;t know how you did it .
the kids are asleep .
the cough syrup hasn &apos;t been touched .
boy , you &apos;re just waiting for an excuse to give me the boot .
well , if history &apos;s any indicator , i won &apos;t have to wait long .
so you don &apos;t think people can change ?
i think , at a certain point , people just are who they are .
well , i think people can change .
now take you . you were the perfect wife and mom .
then along came rick .
how did you ... ?
come on , lynette .
you kids &apos;re young when i was sneaking around on glamor ,
but you knew something was up .
you heard about this from my kids ?
just the girl .
and all she knows is that ,
&quot; daddy got mad because rick liked you . &quot;
nothing happened between me and rick .
yes , he came on to me , but unlike you ,
i controlled myself .
well , you had tom to come home to .
i had your stepfather .
hey , glen may have bored you ,
but the years we had a father
in that house were the happiest of my life .
you didn &apos;t care about that though , did you ?
you just drove him away .
and you couldn &apos;t wait to pay me back !
do you remember what you said the next year ?
when i got sick ?
no , i don &apos;t .
liar .
you said i earned it .
it was god &apos;s punishment .
how are you feeling now , lynette ?
you think you &apos;re being punished ?
how can you say that ?
you were so sanctimonious .
you could not imagine what
sort of woman could do that kind of thing .
not so hard to imagine now , is it ?
stop comparing us . i never did what you did .
no , you just wanted to .
you &apos;re leaving tomorrow . i don &apos;t want your money .
i don &apos;t want you in my house .
hey ! you are sick , lynette .
you think you know what you &apos;re in for
&apos;cause you watched me go through it ?
watching it is nothing .
you &apos;re gonna feel worse than you thought a person &apos;d feel ,
and i &apos;ll be holding your hand through every damn minute .
you can &apos;t stay if i don &apos;t want you here .
you can fight me or you can fight the cancer .
trust me , you won &apos;t have the strength to do both .
andrew , do young people still say &quot; awesome &quot; ?
not so much . try &quot; off the hook . &quot;
&quot; off the hook &quot; ? that doesn &apos;t make sense .
fine . type in &quot; groovy . &quot; see if i care .
hello . hodge residence .
oh , hi , danielle .
listen , i am sending julie mayer an e @-@ mail from you .
now would you say that your school was &quot; off the hook &quot; ?
no . i would say it was &quot; sucky , &quot;
or &quot; crappy , &quot; or &quot; a freaking nightmare . &quot;
mom , you have got to talk to the nuns .
they are so harsh with me .
and they have all these stupid rules .
if you &apos;re still gonna complain , i &apos;m going to hang up .
well , perhaps some of the rules had been in place
when you took up with edie &apos;s nephew ,
you might not be in this pickle .
mom , please , i just want to come home .
look , i am gonna say this one last time .
you are gonna stay put until that baby is born .
now , don &apos;t forget , we &apos;re driving up this weekend
and i am bringing your favorite , lemon squares . and ...
darling , can i draw you a bath ?
oh , that would be lovely .
oh , would you give me a hand , please ?
there you go .
it &apos;s almost the time for the six @-@ month size .
oh , don &apos;t remind me .
no . no , it &apos;s no problem . i can fix that for you .
just give me your name and address .
i &apos;m mrs. emmeline walcott and i &apos;m at 42 old mill road .
i &apos;ve got to stop and pick up a douglas valve ,
but i should be there in 45 minutes tops .
i hate to see you drive when you &apos;re this tired .
there &apos;s some iced coffee in the fridge .
i &apos;ll be fine .
see you when i get back .
you were great .
did you all ever doubt i would be ?
just hurry up and get dressed .
we only have 45 minutes !
ok .
are you mike ?
yeah . i &apos;m looking for a mrs. walcott &apos;s house .
you &apos;ve come to the right place . here , put this on .
you mind telling me what susan &apos;s up to ?
ask her yourself .
hello .
are you sure about this ?
i don &apos;t want you to look back
and regret not having your perfect wedding .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed ,
but my idea of a perfect wedding keeps changing .
one day i want white roses and then i want lilies .
first i want a harpist and then a string quartet .
only one thing stays constant ...
... and i &apos;m looking at him .
why &apos;d i need anything else to make my wedding perfect ?
well , who knew downsizing could be so romantic ?
mrs. walcott , i presume ?
that &apos;s right , sugar .
you might want to check that breast pocket of your suit .
just so you know , you &apos;ll be paying for those
and the lights and the flowers .
i &apos;ve never seen you look so beautiful .
you clean up pretty good yourself .
are we ready ?
are you kidding ?
they &apos;ve been dragging this out for three years .
we are gathered here today to join together
mike delfino and susan mayer in matrimony .
an honorable estate not to be entered into lightly ,
but reverently and soberly .
family . there is nothing more important . &lt; / i &gt;
they are the ones who show up when we &apos;re in trouble . &lt; / i &gt;
the ones who push us to succeed . &lt; / i &gt;
the ones who help keep our secrets . &lt; / i &gt;
but what of those who have no family to rely on ? &lt; / i &gt;
what happens to those poor souls , &lt; / i &gt;
who have no loved ones to help them in their hour of need ? &lt; / i &gt;
well , most learn to walk life &apos;s road by themselves ... &lt; / i &gt;
... but a sad few of us ... &lt; / i &gt;
... simply stop trying . &lt; / i &gt;
