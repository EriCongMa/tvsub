what &apos;s wrong ?
over the past month ,
the fourth year associates have called our top clients .
we &apos;re worried they &apos;re thinking of leaving with them .
do you have any insight ?
we need to leave by the end of the week .
people want to wait for bonuses .
we can &apos;t keep fooling the partners .
i gave an interview to the law advocate .
what did you say ?
i talked about the money ,
the $ 45,000 that you took .
we negotiate an exit package .
diane gave an interview that exposed the firm to criticism .
we &apos;re getting calls from clients .
this is my firm .
it was your firm .
what &apos;s this ? i asked for the greenberg deposition from march ,
not november . are you deaf ?
you &apos;re the paralegal who &apos;s good with computers .
could you help with my laptop in about ten minutes ?
oh , good , i need some help moving boxes
out of diane &apos;s office when you get a chance .
i &apos;ll take it .
hey , chrissy , how are you ?
okay .
uh , hey , alicia , do you have a minute ?
um , not right now . how &apos; bout in an hour ?
sure .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i &apos;m just ...
it &apos;s hard .
i know ,
but it &apos;s good experience , and you &apos;ll make a lot of connections
for when you pass the bar .
i guess .
chrissy , i &apos;ll be right back .
no .
it &apos;s all right . i figured out what i want to do .
what do you mean ?
nothing . everything &apos;s good .
we &apos;re having trouble downloading files .
you shouldn &apos;t be talking here .
don &apos;t worry . everybody just
thinks we &apos;re discussing the zimbalist depo .
i spent the whole afternoon trying to download files to take with us ,
but there &apos;s some sort of firewall in the way .
it &apos;s david lee . he &apos;s still suspicious that we &apos;re leaving .
the clients are coming with us , right ? once they come with us ,
lockhart / gardner doesn &apos;t own the files . the clients do .
right , but they can delay delivering the files to us .
once all hell breaks loose ,
they &apos;re not gonna want to lift a finger for us .
they &apos;ll have to . the clients will sue .
so ? lockhart / gardner will just absorb the suit ,
knowing we can &apos;t do a good job representing our clients
without their files .
i agree . hey , we &apos;re stealing their clients .
no , no , no . we &apos;re not stealing .
we &apos;re not stealing .
either way , they &apos;re gonna think we &apos;re stealing them .
they &apos;re gonna be pissed .
all right , all right . so what do we do ?
well ... partners can get around the firewall .
no .
no , that would be wrong .
you don &apos;t have to do all the files , just the new ones .
diane &apos;s cases .
what &apos;s this ?
the zimbalist deposition .
i need the paralegal , the brunette one .
where is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s probably helping will in diane &apos;s office .
okay .
good luck with the zimbalist deposition .
so , this is surprising .
hi , viola . how are you ?
i &apos;m good , will .
and it &apos;s always good to see you ,
especially in such a triumphant state .
so , what do you need , viola ?
oh , may i ?
you know , diane and i were great friends in law school .
but we were always in competition , the same jobs ,
the same boyfriends , same everything .
so this judgeship is hitting quite hard .
you want one .
that would be nice .
but i feel that her advancement started
when she stole ...
actually , you both stole a client from me .
have you seen that paralegal ?
what &apos;s her name ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen her .
oh . that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . your paralegal .
she &apos;s suing you .
chrissy is suing us ?
and diane . and the firm .
for what ?
for a hostile work environment .
that bitch . i can &apos;t believe it .
david .
no , that &apos;s okay .
there &apos;s a lot worse than that in the complaints .
something , unfortunately ,
that might upset diane &apos;s confirmation .
so this is between you and diane
and we &apos;re just collateral damage ?
no . this is between a firm and a paralegal ,
and we &apos;re all just slaves to the facts .
you &apos;re getting better .
i &apos;m getting out my aggressions .
it &apos;s a turn @-@ on .
来自洛 &amp; 加律所
work again ?
go ahead , take it . i &apos;m fine .
no .
finally , i don &apos;t have to take it .
we have to talk about the inauguration .
no , you have to talk about it . i ...
what &apos;s that mean ?
six days .
until you leave ? oh .
i &apos;m gonna miss this office .
you sure you want to go ?
okay , eli . what &apos;s the problem ?
you told nora you want the inaugural ball
moved to the governor &apos;s mansion
but traditionally it &apos;s held at exposition hall ,
and i &apos;m getting some trouble from the unions .
wait , what ?
you want the inaugural ball moved to the governor &apos;s mansion ,
but the unions are threatening to strike
if we move it because it &apos;s a non @-@ union ...
okay wait , eli wait .
i never said anything . i don &apos;t know what you heard ,
but your office called me and asked me
if it would be fine to move the ball to the governor &apos;s mansion ,
and i told them what i &apos;m telling you : i don &apos;t care .
so you ...
didn &apos;t ask for it to be moved to the governor &apos;s mansion ?
does it sound like me to say
want it moved to the governor &apos;s mansion ?
nora said that mrs. florrick insisted ...
and there you go .
i have a partners &apos; meeting .
good luck .
nora , is mrs. florrick there ?
n @-@ no .
the mrs. florrick that asked for the inaugural
to be moved to the mansion .
hello , mr. gold . how are you ?
diane .
my god . look at you .
fran , lyle , hi !
it &apos;s been forever .
well , we were in lyon for the spring .
you look fantastic .
well , thank you . and this is kurt .
good to meet you .
ah , you must be the lucky gentleman.- yes .
these are my oldest friends , francesca and lyle .
i set them up .
blind date , right out of law school .
which reminds me , i heard viola was in town .
did you see her ?
viola walsh ? no .
and what have you two been doing today ?
you ... smell like you &apos;ve been camping .
that &apos;s gunpowder .
we were out shooting this morning .
guns ? really ?
a smith &amp; wesson ...
model 29 .
model 29 .
well then , that &apos;s a new side of you , diane .
oh , sorry . do you mind ?
来自洛 &amp; 加律所
i have to take this .
are you a hunter , mr ...
mcveigh .
oh , mcveigh . like @-@ like , uh , the other ...
like the other mcveigh ?
what other ?
uh , the one who , um , uh ...
you know , the one ... he &apos;s dead now . um , uh ...
nixon ?
no , the one who uh , you know ...
blew up the alfred p. murrah federal building in oklahoma city ?
yeah .
will , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s your old friend , viola walsh .
she &apos;s suing us .
she got one of our paralegals to accuse us .
well , i don &apos;t know what that has to do with me .
you all pushed me out , remember ?
she &apos;s saying you sexually harassed her .
i ... she what ?
how &apos;s that gonna look to your friends in the supreme court ?
this is what i say : she slimes us , we slime her .
we got kalinda on this , find out everything in her past ,
everything we can use .
wait . who said that i harassed her ?
chrissy quinn .
she said that you asked her to prostitute herself to a client ,
that ... cary showed her how he masturbated
and i asked her how she lost her virginity .
and i tried to rape her . i don &apos;t even know who she is .
do you realize the united states has the highest percentage
of civilian gun ownership ...
slime her-- that &apos;s what i say .
this is blackmail . they want a quick settlement .
it &apos;s viola walsh , diane .
she &apos;s got an issue with your judgeship .
tell me what you need me to do .
so you don &apos;t think sandy hook changed anything ?
i think that the second amendment
keeps everything from being changed .
but did you see those kids &apos; bodies ?
did you see the photos ?
what i don &apos;t understand is
how your guns could matter more than that .
i didn &apos;t say that .
you &apos;re making that connec ...
so ...
how we doing ?
good , i think .
great .
i think we should , um ...
we &apos;re meeting some friends , diane .
join us . we &apos;re almost done .
no , no . we &apos;ll @-@ we &apos;ll call you .
we &apos;ll @-@ we &apos;ll arrange lunch some other time .
okay , say hi to the kids .
okay .
stimulating conversation ?
your friends have some strong opinions .
so does my fiance .
you knew that about me .
i did .
if we settle for $ 2 million ,
insurance will cover 40 % , but ...
we may lose some clients .
no , we fight it .
then we have to move quick .
so who do we get to represent us ?
i &apos;m sorry . i have to hit 10,000 paces
or my bangle gets mad at me .
we &apos;d like to hire you , ms. tascioni .
actually , we &apos;re considering hiring you .
we &apos;re being sued by a female paralegal
for being a hostile workplace .
how long has this paralegal worked for you ?
two years . why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i keep asking questions until they make sense .
and ... who &apos;s representing her ?
viola walsh , a lawyer from l.a. ,
but she &apos;s opening up offices here .
is she tall ?
a bit . five @-@ seven ?
you &apos;re kidding me .
the worry , ms. tascioni ,
is that we &apos;re in a transition period at the firm
and that this suit could be used to hurt us .
so ...
you think this suit is about your transition period .
yes .
okay . then we move fast .
call this tall lawyer &apos;s bluff .
arrange depositions now .
and i &apos;ll get your investigator ...
um , kalinda , right ?
right . i &apos;ll get her looking into this
paralegal &apos;s background .
slime her before she can slime you .
when can you start ?
to the right .
a little to the left .
to the left . good .
and you can put the seal over there .
so , jackie ,
what are we doing here ?
rearranging . mm @-@ hmm .
do you think the seal would look good there ?
there ? why not the men &apos;s room ?
mr. gold .
take it down and put the seal back up in its place .
what are you doing , mr. gold ?
putting the state seal back up
and keeping every reporter from asking
if the governorship has gone to peter &apos;s head .
he won , eli .
it &apos;s not wrong to put such a beautiful portrait
in a place of prominence .
hmm , maybe it &apos;s not wrong , jackie , but it is stupid .
perhaps you and i should have a little talk , hmm ?
put the seal back !
yes , sir .
jackie , you and i have had some ...
times together .
we have ... over the years .
and we &apos;ve had some ... disagreements along the way .
not so many .
but now your son is governor ,
and any disagreement results in bigger issues ,
so we need to stop .
whenever you want something changed around here ,
no matter how small , no matter how insignificant ,
you have to ask .
certainly .
no .
you have to ask me .
not peter , not alicia .
not the little fairies that sit on your shoulder .
just me .
he &apos;s my son , eli .
you can &apos;t keep me from speaking to my son .
i can , actually .
you don &apos;t want to challenge me on this , jackie .
not the campaign manager
that got his candidate elected by six points .
i &apos;ll talk to peter .
do that .
i &apos;ll have him call you in 20 minutes .
the call will last exactly four minutes , so ,
keep it quick .
christina quinn , the paralegal who used to work here--
i need everything that you can find on her .
dirt ?
yes .
work history , sexual history .
anything that would be ...
where do you get your hair done ?
where ? uh , i don &apos;t know . different places .
i wish my hair would behave .
it just flops . just ...
i flop it this way or that way .
you knew this paralegal ?
uh , the one suing us ? yeah .
what do you think of her ?
i think she &apos;s very ... young .
you read her accusations ?
yes .
she accused everybody of improprieties but you .
yeah , i saw that .
are her accusations true ?
no .
but you &apos;re hesitant ?
no . i just think some things are open to interpretation .
do you think sexual harassment is open to interpretation ?
no .
okay , time to walk .
look at us-- out to save the world .
who took that ?
viola walsh , wasn &apos;t it ?
so , here you are in my apartment
for the first time in five years ,
and my guess is that you have something to get off your chest .
are we that obvious ?
a bit . what is it ?
how well do you know kurt ?
what ?
he disagrees with you about the right to bear arms .
look , he disagrees with me about that .
i disagree with him .
it &apos;s not a stumbling block .
but his views , diane .
all his views . he supports sarah palin .
i know . i can &apos;t believe it .
i fell in love with a palin supporter .
it &apos;s not funny , diane .
do you see her ? she &apos;s back on fox .
oh , you don &apos;t watch fox .
they show clips on jon stewart .
his views on obama
and secessionism .
okay , so , what is this , an intervention ?
no , it &apos;s just ...
issues matter .
i know we &apos;re all supposed to disagree and smile
and go home and pretend it &apos;s all some big tennis match ,
but people end up poorer ,
guns end up killing people .
global warming keeps destroying our ...
so , you &apos;re saying i shouldn &apos;t be happy ?
no , what we &apos;re saying is ,
do you really know who this guy is ?
do you know his religion , his politics ?
thanks for stopping by ,
but i actually do have to go to work .
no . diane , please , just sit and talk .
fran , lyle ,
if i fell into a life of addiction ,
then , please , do intervene , but don &apos;t for this .
not for love .
the best advice you ever gave me ,
diane , when i met lyle was ,
make sure your love can survive outside the bubble .
i give it back to you .
how long have you worked at lockhart / gardner ?
shall we say hello first ?
hello .
how long have you worked at lockhart / gardner ?
two years .
who hired you ?
alicia ... florrick .
what were your duties ?
paralegal .
uh , typing up briefs , researching cases ,
making copies , that sort of thing .
how did you lose your virginity ?
objection . how is that relevant ?
chrissy charged in her complaint
that alicia florrick asked her how she lost her virginity ,
so i &apos;m just asking , what was the answer ?
i ... didn &apos;t answer .
was there anyone else there when she asked you this ?
myself , cary agos , our client and six other associates .
and the issue of virginity came up ?
well , it didn &apos;t come up .
the lawsuit was about someone selling their virginity online ,
and the difference between implied and explicit contract .
in other words , you didn &apos;t bring up
the issue of virginity , it was the issue of the lawsuit ?
do you want to take over the questioning ?
sure .
was virginity the subject of the lawsuit ?
yes .
and how did you come to ask chrissy
about her loss of virginity ?
the other associates were discussing their experiences ,
and i saw chrissy laugh to herself .
i thought she had something she wanted to share ,
so i asked her , did she have something to add ?
those were your exact words ?
they were .
i can see why you &apos;re suing .
then what happened ?
cary agos asked me to stay late on the ginsberg case .
and this was a sexual case , too ?
yes , prostitution .
lockhart / gardner just seems
to obsess on these sexual cases .
is that a question ?
no .
it &apos;s just an odd observation .
then what happened
during your late @-@ night work on this case ?
cary showed me how he masturbated .
and how did he show you this ?
with his hand ?
uh ... his right hand ?
and it was just the two of you ?
yes .
and what was being discussed at the time ?
a plea bargain .
the state &apos;s attorney offered to sit down with us
and discuss a plea of three years .
and you didn &apos;t think much of it ?
no . no , i didn &apos;t .
so , when chrissy reported this offer to you , what did you do ?
i made a gesture .
a gesture of @-@ of masturbation ?
yes .
and
by this gesture , did you mean ...
this is how i masturbate ?
no . no .
what did you mean by it ?
that it was a pointless exercise .
strike two .
maybe ... maybe try something other than sex .
had you ever seen this partner ?
howard lyman ? no .
he &apos;s the oldest partner . he only comes in every now and then .
and he sent you an e @-@ mail about a week ago .
can you read it ?
&quot; chrissy , i need to discuss something with you .
&quot; please come to my office at 1 : 00 p.m. ,
enter quietly , and sit down at my desk . &quot;
and you had no case with him ?
that &apos;s correct .
and then ,
when you got there , what happened ?
he took off his pants and exposed himself to me .
we have a problem . howard lyman .
look , i told you .
we &apos;re not having the inaugural at the mansion .
we moved it to a union house .
but you won &apos;t call off the strike ?
that &apos;s right .
why not ?
because your guy supported scott walker in wisconsin .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s a governor in a nearby state .
he had to show some support .
eli , unions in this country are endangered .
every time someone comes out in support of scott walker ...
so you &apos;re going to protest our inaugural ?
that is blackmail . that is bad faith .
it &apos;s not just you , eli .
we &apos;re making a stand across the midwest .
don &apos;t take it personally .
you told me it was about the mansion .
i got jackie to back off the mansion ,
and now you &apos;re saying ...
jackie florrick ?
what ? yes . why ?
how &apos;s she doing ?
jackie ? she &apos;s fine . why ?
say hello for me , huh ?
霍华德 · 莱曼
so , what do we ask him ?
whether he brought chrissy here ,
and if took his clothes off in front of her .
howard ?
oh , my god .
what ? huh ? what time is it ?
1 : 00 .
i don &apos;t have a meeting till 2 : 00 .
you have a meeting now . we have a problem .
she came in here .
i didn &apos;t ask her to , i didn &apos;t invite her in .
but you didn &apos;t have your pants or your underwear on ?
i always take it off for lunch .
i take a nap .
i get all sweaty on ... on my ...
you know , bottom half .
and i did not keep her from leaving .
bitch screamed . i was just offering her some water .
oh , dear god .
look , i am the innocent party here .
the girl came in here and tried to ...
she , uh ... she tried to ...
i don &apos;t know what she was trying to do .
i was just taking a nap .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know .
they just got called into the partner &apos;s meeting .
damn it .
it might not be anything .
you need to get those files .
alicia ?
diane . how are you ?
you know , i just got a glimpse
of what my life would look like if i &apos;d never started this firm .
and ?
yeah , i liked it .
i liked it a lot .
shall we ?
i understand your frustration , but it isn &apos;t what it seems .
it was a joke .
a prank . that &apos;s all .
in what way was it a joke ?
look , we all
knew lyman slept off his lunch without his pants on .
and we &apos;d sent out some e @-@ mails to some of the paralegals .
not just the women . it was the men , too .
so you sent this e @-@ mail to chrissy from howard &apos;s account ?
yes .
still haven &apos;t negotiated my exit package yet .
no .
we &apos;ve negotiated your package . you just haven &apos;t accepted it .
do you want to talk or not ?
give me my gun control case ,
and let me finish out the sonya rucker contract ,
and i will agree to the terms .
you &apos;ll keep your clients in house ?
i &apos;ll do everything i can .
one more thing .
indemnify me against this case .
this howard lyman thing is b.s.
good .
then indemnify me .
sure .
whatever you want .
good luck .
not with a bang .
what are you doing ?
w @-@ what am i ... ?
the sonya rucker contract .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re downloading my file .
i couldn &apos;t access it .
no , i , um ...
i @-@ i think i stumbled ...
alicia , i talked to will ; it &apos;s my case .
there &apos;s a firewall protecting it .
look , my mistake .
how &apos;d it go ?
oh , i have to stay a few hours .
okay , i &apos;ll come back .
i want to meet your friends , kurt ,
your best friends .
why ?
don &apos;t you find it odd
that we &apos;ve been talking about marriage
and i &apos;ve never met a single one of your friends ?
no .
is this about your friends yesterday ?
do you remember their names ?
no .
is that important ?
i want to meet your friends .
uh , before lockhart / gardner ,
you worked at hoffman / ross .
is that correct ?
yes , why ?
and did you ever make an accusation against your boss there ?
what , is this a fishing expedition ?
it is .
luckily it &apos;s a deposition .
did you ever make an accusation against your boss there , chrissy ?
&apos;cause we have the texts on your lockhart / gardner cell phone .
how very nsa of you .
it &apos;s our cell phones , our property .
did you ever make an accusation against your previous boss ?
not an official accusation .
how about an unofficial one ?
he came on to me .
yes , you accused him of taking off his clothes in your presence .
okay , that is so dirty .
i &apos;m just saying ...
you are trying ...
to make a connection
it &apos;s quite a coincidence that all these
between two completely unrelated ...
bosses want to take their pants off .
so , we got rid of most of the charges
and we lucked into something
that neutralized the howard lyman threat .
thank you , kalinda .
but , uh , we still have two issues .
do you mind if i eat ? i missed lunch .
please .
two problems-- well , three .
chrissy &apos;s suggesting that you , diane , prostituted her out .
i have no idea what she &apos;s talking about .
and that you , will , created a hostile workplace
by sleeping with underlings in your office .
i can answer that .
have you noticed ,
i &apos;m the only one in the clear here ?
now here comes the third problem . kalinda .
i found this saved onto howard lyman &apos;s i.t. file .
it &apos;s from his laptop .
hey , why don &apos;t you come over here
and sit on daddy &apos;s lap , huh , honey ?
oh , dear god .
who is that ?
another paralegal-- lacey atkins .
hired last year .
this should have no impact on this lawsuit .
the fact that he approached another paralegal has
marginal bearing on this case .
or you can tell yourselves that .
thanks , diane .
so we bury it
and get rid of howard .
uh , will .
i was looking into the partner decorating stipends .
about a month ago ,
alicia stopped decorating her office .
did you ask her to stop ?
no , why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just found it odd .
lift .
think of the ball as your grandkids .
there you go .
and up ...
i &apos;m sorry , jackie .
what are you sorry for , mr. gold ?
you made yourself very clear .
beth , i &apos;ll be with you in a minute .
i &apos;m sorry because i &apos;ve had a change of heart .
i find ...
i need your help .
my help ?
no , no , there &apos;s too much chance of disagreement between us .
jackie , i &apos;m apologizing .
and i &apos;m telling you ,
you have no reason to apologize .
you were right and i was wrong .
and what do you say we dance ? so , forward .
two , three , and go back .
really feel it in the arms .
okay , what do you want ?
control of the inauguration .
really ?
all right , and ...
control of the ball .
and decorating of peter &apos;s offices .
and forward ...
agreed .
good .
what kind of assistance do you need ?
you know the food service union chief ?
no , who &apos;s that ?
ronald erickson .
oh , yes , ronnie .
how is he ?
this is his number .
excellent , excellent .
give him a call .
and one more time .
forward .
i like diane a lot .
i wanted to be like her .
and you went to her
with this client &apos;s undue attention
because you liked her ?
yes .
i know mr. gainsborough is one of her top clients ,
but i told her what he said .
that you looked hot ?
yes , and that he kept watching me
and asked me my bra size .
and what did diane say ?
she said ,
&quot; don &apos;t worry about it .
he meant it as a compliment . &quot;
that &apos;s when i lost my respect for her .
yes , i can understand that .
chrissy never mentioned she was uncomfortable
with mr. gainsborough &apos;s comment .
yes , but she came to you ,
ms. lockhart , and told you what he said ?
yes .
and you told her to take it as a compliment
and let it go ?
yes .
comments about being hot ,
questions about bra size-- these are compliments ?
from a gay fashion designer , they are .
so you &apos;re saying that , um ...
strike that .
you didn &apos;t know ...
chrissy didn &apos;t know that mr. gainsborough was gay ,
did she ?
i don &apos;t know , i thought she did .
she knew he was a fashion designer .
really , so now you &apos;re saying
that paralegals should stereotype
fashion designers or , or anyone
who they deem to be someone that might not fit into a ...
you &apos;re in a hole ,
ms. walsh , best to stop digging .
$ 1 million .
no .
oh , come on ,
it &apos;s not going away .
pay us $ 1 million and it &apos;s over .
viola ,
you &apos;re losing , you &apos;re losing badly .
we &apos;ll make you this deal .
stop right now and we won &apos;t countersue you
for filing a frivolous lawsuit .
we still have you in your office
conducting sexual relations with underlings .
oh , i forgot .
here is an affidavit from mr. gardner and tammy linnata .
they swear they ...
... they only had sexual relations once in his office ,
and she was never in the employ of lockhart / gardner ,
so she was not an underling .
and this is the only time you &apos;ve ever had sex in your office ?
it is .
will .
that wasn &apos;t true--
what you just said .
what ?
that wasn &apos;t the only time you had sex in your office .
you don &apos;t remember ?
no , i @-@ i mean , i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i do ,
uh , but it was ...
we didn &apos;t have sex .
are , are we defining sex more restrictively ?
because , as i remember it ...
i don &apos;t think we want that to get out .
i agree ,
but your affidavit could prove problematic
because , at the point in time we &apos;re talking about ,
i was an underling .

technically that &apos;s not my office .
that &apos;s my bathroom .
chrissy did only say in your office , didn &apos;t she ?
yes , sex in my office ,
so we didn &apos;t have sex in my office .
good ... good .

you taped it , you moron .

yes , the one we were going to keep private .
how did they get it ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but the worry is , they did .
someone &apos;s feeding them our dirty laundry ?
yes , now , the question is who ?
so i shouldn &apos;t bring up obama ?

why wouldn &apos;t i like them ?
she &apos;s a snowboarder .
and how did you meet them ?
in class .
oh , in class .
and this class is all women ?
you didn &apos;t like that they were women ?
no , i &apos;m fine with the fact that they were all women .
it &apos;s just , they were all in their twenties .
they are all excellent terminal ballistic experts .
have you slept with any of those ballistic experts ?
no .
why are we getting married , kurt ?
do you not want to ?
i don &apos;t know .
ronnie ?
mrs. florrick .
what is this &quot; mrs. florrick &quot; that &apos;s new .
jackie . i &apos;m intimidated now .
you &apos;re the governor &apos;s wife . mom , i mean .
i &apos;m still good old jackie @-@ o .
do you remember that time on georgie &apos;s boat ?
yes , very well . do you ?
we were a lot younger .
we weren &apos;t that much younger .
i &apos;ve gone grey .
grey suits you .
janice will be thrilled that i ran into you .
yes .
she wouldn &apos;t mind if i took old ronnie out
for a drink , would she ?
it &apos;s been such a long time .
you got a problem .
just one ?
someone in our firm
is feeding evidence to viola walsh so she can attack us .
i &apos;ve been asked to find out who .
and ?
it &apos;s one of your rebels .
how do you know ?
because he left a lot of fingerprints
on an e @-@ mail he sent to viola .
kalinda , do me a favor .
i just did you a favor .
do me another .
i have to tell will .
i know . give me an hour head start .
you have 30 minutes .
what were you thinking , tony ?
i was thinking what we were all thinking .
we need clients . we need ...
you don &apos;t sabotage your own firm .
lockhart / gardner isn &apos;t my firm . florrick / agos is .
it &apos;s so dumb ! they could sue us !
they &apos;re gonna fire you in about ten minutes .
we need you to go along with it . don &apos;t say anything .
so , i get fired , i lose my bonus .
i &apos;m out $ 30,000 .
well , you shouldn &apos;t have gotten caught !
no , we should share our bonuses .
there &apos;s no reason i should suffer for helping out the whole team .
oh , helping out the whole team .
it was your idea in the first place .
all right , then why should i stay silent when they fire me ?
so you &apos;re threatening us ?
no , i &apos;m telling you .
we all shared the start @-@ up costs .
we should share the bonuses .
what do you think ?
i think we &apos;ve got the mafia here .
we &apos;ve been moving software to pay @-@ per @-@ use
and had a massive uptick .
but you know . you &apos;re our lawyer .
so you &apos;re happy with the firm ?
lockhart / gardner ?
yes .
i mean , you &apos;re not thinking of leaving ?
well , i &apos;ve been hearing rumors that you &apos;re leaving
for a judgeship , and if that &apos;s the case ,
we might look around , yeah .
why ?
has anyone approached you about joining another firm ?
a new firm ?
just the usual calls , you know .
but some of our lawyers have approached you , right ?
i mean , it &apos;s all right . they ... they &apos;ve talked to me .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m supposed to say anything until it &apos;s official .
no , i understand .
alicia already told me that , uh ,
she &apos;s taking you on , so , i &apos;m fine .
really ?
because a firm with the governor &apos;s wife on the letterhead
is hard to pass up .
diane ?
yes , good .
did i say something ?
no , no . it &apos;s just , um ...
i @-@ i have to go . i &apos;ll call you later .
yes ! i don &apos;t know how you did it .
in fact , i don &apos;t think i want to know ,
but the union has backed off .
they &apos;re not going to strike the inaugural .
i &apos;m so happy , eli . oh , a little higher .
higher .
so we &apos;re putting peter back up again ?
yes . he looks wonderful , don &apos;t you think ?
and the seal ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you have a suggestion ?
no . wherever you want .
how about in your office ?
oh , congratulations .
congratulations .
you got stood up , huh ?
not sure yet .
hey , i got a sister you can marry .
i &apos;m fine , thanks .
sorry .
no .
we &apos;re good ?
always .
you know we don &apos;t have to do this .
i know .
get a room .
you have to pay our legal fees ,
and we will forgive and forget this .
really ?
well , i wasn &apos;t keeping score ,
but i thought the last time i checked , i was ahead .
we just have one more witness .
and was it surprising to you
that chrissy accused everybody at the firm but you ?
no .
it wasn &apos;t ?
and why is that ?
well , she liked me .
and in what way did she ... like you ?
in a lot of ways .
and where did she ... like you most ?
in the copy room , in the pantry ,
and sometimes in the bullpen at night .
so , at work ?
yeah .
but chrissy said she was offended
by all the sexual activity at work .
i know . odd .
thank you , kalinda .
your witness .
okay , let me talk to my client .
lockhart / gardner . how may i direct your call ?
yes . yes , she is .
30 minutes ?
i am so sorry i &apos;m late .
please , my office is this way .
missing it already ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you had gone .
we &apos;re settling with chrissy .
the compromise .
joely , could you give me a minute ?
oh , sure . sure . i &apos;ll be right out here .
stability .
what ?
alicia &apos;s leaving the firm with cary ,
and she &apos;s taking our top clients .
