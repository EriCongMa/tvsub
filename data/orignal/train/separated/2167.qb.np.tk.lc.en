i know you &apos;re scared .
but ... it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i want my mommy .
i know exactly how you feel .
gotta hand it to you , buddy .
you got a lot of heart , showing up with that haircut .
you know , i find it difficult to be insulted by a man
who uses more product in his hair than most women do .
sinead o &apos;connor called , she wants her hairstyle back .
very good .
well , hairstyle would imply that this was intentional ,
and i think steve just got a little carried away trimming his sideburns .
you , too , huh ?
what ? it &apos;s what happened .
it &apos;s okay .
hakkeyoi nokotta , nokotta , nokotta !
there you go , people .

for a chance at free grindz ?
dude , pick me , pick me !
over here , man .

get in the ring , little sistah .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding .

i like homegirl &apos;s chances . she &apos;s , uh ...
she &apos;s very scrappy @-@ looking .
all right , i like her a lot .
thanks , zac .
sorry i &apos;m late .
no worries . i just ordered .
everything okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
it &apos;s adam .
i just haven &apos;t heard from him in days .
left him messages , sent him texts .
well , maybe he &apos;s tied up at work .
maybe .
maybe he &apos;s just avoiding me .
kono , what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t really put my finger on it . it &apos;s just ...
adam &apos;s definitely different .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s more secretive , you know ?
it &apos;s like he &apos;s hiding something .
hiding what ?
i &apos;m not sure .
it seemed to start when his ...
when his brother michael came out of prison .
kono , that was months ago .
why didn &apos;t you say something sooner ?
if you can &apos;t trust adam , then you can &apos;t be with him .
do you trust him ?
i don &apos;t know .
look , you know that i had my doubts about him , right ?
yeah .
but he was there for you when you needed him most .
so , before you assume the worst ,
why don &apos;t you at least give him a chance to explain ?
hakkeyoi nokotta , nokotta , nokotta !
ooh , bold new look there , boss .
everybody ? really ? okay , it &apos;s hair .
you know the good thing about hair ? it grows back .
if you &apos;re lucky .
hakkeyoi nokotta , nokotta , nokotta !
winner !
winner !
shrimp dinner !
sorry , cuz .
don &apos;t sweat it . that shrimp plate ?
it &apos;s coming out of your paycheck .
mcgarrett .
yeah , we &apos;re on the way .
we got to go .
a couple hikers discovered her this morning .
jane doe , no i.d.
she can &apos;t be older than 17 .
shot in the back
and dumped in a shallow grave .
my guys found some fresh tire tracks nearby .
csu &apos;s making casts .
no shoes ,
feet are torn up pretty good .
scratches and splinters on her arms .
probably from the branches .
i &apos;m thinking the shooter drove out here to execute her ,
she made a run for it ,
he shot her in the back .
you all right ?
we got to go find her parents .
okay , thank you .
lab just confirmed that the tire tracks found at the scene
are consistent with late @-@ model ford vans and trucks--
that &apos;s anything manufactured after 2008 .
plus , the tires were sold commercially .
that &apos;s fantastic .
so that narrows it down to about 2,000 vehicles on this island .
hey , so the autopsy report came back .
max put t.o.d. around 1 : 00 a.m. this morning .
but this is what you really need to see .
what is that , ankle bruising ?
it &apos;s not just bruising .
it &apos;s scar tissue .
max also found calcification around the ankle bone .
for that to develop , the victim
would have had to have been restrained a long time .
how long ?
years .
they were keeping this girl prisoner .
all right , max say there were any signs of sexual abuse ?
no .
but he did find a foreign hair on the body .
okay .
if the hair doesn &apos;t belong to the victim ,
maybe her killer left it behind .
yeah , fong &apos;s running it for dna .
got an i.d. on our jane doe .
prints turned up in the missing persons database .
her name &apos;s amanda morris .
my god . when did she go missing ?
2003 .
she was seven years old when she was kidnapped ,
which would make her 17 today .
chin , run age progression software on that photograph , please .
it &apos;s obviously her .
amanda morris was kidnapped ten years ago .
where &apos;s she been this whole time ?
the only thing worse than losing your daughter ...
is losing her twice .
all those years spent waiting ,
holding out hope that the police would find amanda .
and that whole time , she was right here on the island ?
i don &apos;t understand .
how could this happen ?
well ,
there &apos;s still a lot that we don &apos;t know about this case .
but , uh , please believe me when i say
we are doing everything we can to find the person who did this .
we know it was a long time ago , but anything you can tell us
about amanda &apos;s abduction could maybe help with our case .
it was her summer break ,
and we were at the water park .
amanda had worked up enough courage to
go down the high slide ,
so i @-@ i walked her over to the line and ...
and i waited at the bottom .
i had my camera out to take that picture of her coming down .
she never did .
it &apos;s likely
whoever took your daughter was using the water park
as his hunting ground .
this could have happened to anybody .
yeah .
but it happened to us .
chin , i stopped by hpd ,
and i picked up the case file on amanda &apos;s abduction .
it &apos;s pretty thin .
did their investigation turn up any leads or suspects ?
no . at the time , hpd followed protocol and they ran background
on amanda &apos;s family and neighbors ,
all of them who checked out .
investigators always suspected it was a professional job .
possibly part of a child trafficking ring .
well , except by all appearances ,
amanda was never taken off the island .
so why was she abducted ?
i &apos;m heading back now .
i just need to make a quick stop first .
all right .
okay .
adam ?
drop your weapons !
drop them , both of you !
do the math .
you don &apos;t have enough time to get off two shots .
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
admire the confidence .
comes with the badge .
is that right ?
five @-@ o.
you must be adam &apos;s cop girlfriend .
we got concealed carry permits if you care to see &apos; em .
those things permit you to break into people &apos;s homes , too ?
door was open .
we just came to see if adam was around .
you know where we might find him ?
he went to see sato , didn &apos;t he ?
who the hell is sato ?
never mind , then .
if you see your boyfriend ,
tell him his brother michael &apos;s looking for him .
so , amanda morris is kidnapped ten years ago .
there &apos;s no ransom demands ,
there &apos;s no signs of abuse ,
and we know she wasn &apos;t trafficked
because she never left the island .
okay , so what was the kidnapper doing with her all these years ?
i don &apos;t know , but there &apos;s another question that we &apos;re not asking ,
and that is , why kill her now ?
all right , what changed that led amanda &apos;s abductor
to suddenly want to get rid of her
after ten years ?
hey .
just heard from fong .
lab got a hit on that foreign hair
found on amanda &apos;s body .
only it didn &apos;t come from our killer .
how do we know that ?
because it came back
to a six @-@ year @-@ old girl named ella bishop ...
who was kidnapped from her home in waipio yesterday afternoon .
there &apos;s only one way
that her hair ended up on amanda &apos;s body .
both girls were kidnapped by the same person .
ella was wearing a blue jumper with a whitet @-@ shirt .
she also had a heart bracelet with her name on it .
if anyone has seen her , please call the police right away .
we just want our daughter back .
thank you . we &apos;ll get this out right away .
let &apos;s go .
can i help you ?
yeah , i &apos;m tip gilbert .
and my crew and i are here to see if
the family needs any help .
your daughter was maile ?
yes , she was .
hey , uh , i heard about you guys .
uh , like what you do , you help hpd .
missing persons cases ,
you set up search parties-- it &apos;s good .
never hurts to have too many eyes and ears out there .
right .
look , i know you guys
are doing everything you can to find ella ,
but if you get a lead and need us to hit the streets ,
give me a call .
all right . great .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
nice work . thanks , guys .
no .
i mean , ten years is a long time ,
but i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen her .
sorry .
no .
i got to ask you , though ,
if it &apos;s been so long ,
why do you think these two cases are related ?
mr. bishop , amanda morris &apos; body
was discovered this morning ,
and evidence on it indicates
that she was in contact with your daughter .
oh , no ...
listen ,
we have every reason to believe right now
that your daughter is okay .
hear me ? we think that she &apos;s okay .
so , i need you both to stay optimistic ,
&apos;cause we are gonna find her
and we &apos;re gonna bring her back to you .
okay ?
thank you .
thank you .
okay .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say , okay ?
cop warnning one :
do not make promises that you cannot keep .
okay , i get it .
you all but guaranteed
those people we &apos;d find their daughter .
what ... what happens when we can &apos;t
deliver on that promise , danny ?
what do we do then ?
listen to me .
when grace was taken by rick peterson last year ,
i know it was only for a couple of hours ,
but it felt like a month .
it was the worst day of my life ,
and every second , you cannot stop
thinking about worst @-@ case scenario .
so i @-@ i know what ella &apos;s parents
are going through right now ,
and hope , even if it is false hope ,
is the only thing that &apos;s keeping them going .
yeah , chin ?
hpd canvass got a lead .
one of ella &apos;s neighbors noticed a suspicious vehicle
parked on her street roughly an hour before the kidnapping .
i ran the plate ,
and it came back to a 2009 ford econoline van .
oh , that &apos;s consistent with the tire tracks
that were found at the scene
where amanda morris &apos; body was dumped .
all right , so our killer uses the same van to abduct ella .
uh , who &apos;s it registered to ?
well , that &apos;s the thing .
the van was reported stolen 48 hours ago .
i &apos;ve already put out an apb and a maile amber alert .
hpd has got all available units
searching the island for it .
i &apos;ll update you as soon as we have some more information .
all right , copy that . thank you , chin .
what are you doing ?
getting some extra eyes out there .
detective williams .
danny ,
it &apos;s tip .
we got a lock on the van .
he &apos;s northbound on kalanianaole highway .
coming out of waimanalo .
okay , please stay right on him . we &apos;re on our way .
all right ?
roger that .
show me your hands right now !
on the ground .
face down . face down !
face down ... now lock your fingers behind your head .
danny ?
she in there ?
no .
lloyd grimes .
you got an impressive body of work here .
corruption of a minor , aggravated assault ,
assault with a deadly weapon .
now you can add kidnapping and murder to that resume ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
ella bishop . where is she ?
what , you mean that girl who went missing ?
who &apos;s all in the news ?
why would you think i had something to do with that ?
because the day she went missing , you were spotted
in a stolen van parked two blocks from her house .
i have nothing more to say to you guys .
listen to me , okay ?
the only reason i don &apos;t choke the life out of you
right now is because i think you know where that little girl is .
so do yourself a favor
and speak up .
danny .
tell me where she is right now .
danny !
step away .
i didn &apos;t kidnap any girl , i swear .
oh , you guys are insane !
one , two , three , four ,
five , six , seven , eight .
one , two , three , four ,
five , six , seven , eight .
defense becomes the offense .
what ? get that ball .
good !
danno , what are you doing here ?
come here , babe .
is everything okay ?
yeah .
everything &apos;s good , monkey , i just wanted a hug .
all right ?
all right , go ahead .
ready !
defense becomes the offense .
what ? get that ball .
so , hpd searched our suspect &apos;s house .
no sign of ella , but they did find
upwards of 30 grand worth of stolen property
stashed in the guy &apos;s garage .
okay , so he &apos;s a kidnapper and a thief .
actually , here &apos;s the thing .
a bunch of the items traced back
to recent burglaries in ella &apos;s neighborhood .
this guy hit over a dozen houses over the past month .
that &apos;s why his van was spotted there yesterday .
he wasn &apos;t there to grab ella . he was casing the neighborhood .
makes sense , given there was
another house robbed there last night .
either this guy &apos;s quite the multitasker ,
or he &apos;s not our kidnapper .
saw you on that left . late drop .
i thought you weren &apos;t gonna make it .
yeah , you and me both .
so , what &apos;d you want to talk to me about ?
i need a favor .
all right , steve &apos;s usually the one asking for those .
he sending you to do his dirty work ?
no .
this one &apos;s for me .
i need to run intel on someone ,
but i need it done off the books .
this isn &apos;t about a case , is it ?
what &apos;s the name ?
sato . it &apos;s a common japanese surname .
but the guy i &apos;m looking for is connected
to the yakuza in some way .
is adam in some kind of trouble ?
that &apos;s what i need to find out .
but , catherine ,
i &apos;d really appreciate it if you just kept this between us .
kono , if steve asks me about , i &apos;m not going to lie to him .
he &apos;s not going to ask &apos; cause he doesn &apos;t know anything .
security cam footage from the bank of o &apos;ahu on waipio .
that &apos;s just a few blocks from ella bishop &apos;s house .
one of their atms faces right out onto the street .
i was hoping it may have caught our kidnapper on video .
any luck ?
no .
so far , none of the vehicles matches the tire tracks
found at the murder scene .
you ever hear from adam ?
uh , yeah ... actually .
he finally called back , and you were right .
he was just wrapped up with work .
glad to hear it .
thanks .
that &apos;s odd .
what is ?
that blue sedan
it passes through the intersection
six times in the 20 minutes before ella was abducted .
okay , but the tire tracks at the murder scene
were left by a van or a truck .
oh , our guy could have used
a different vehicle for the kidnapping .
six times in 20 minutes . either he &apos;s lost
or he &apos;s waiting for an opportunity .
i &apos;ll run the plate .
vehicle &apos;s registered to a helen cantera .
that &apos;s cantera .
check out what she &apos;s wearing .
an hpd uniform .
chin , she &apos;s not a cop .
that &apos;s how she got ella into the car with her .
no plates .
and the car in the video was blue .
paint &apos;s fresh . cantera &apos;s trying to cover her tracks .
movement . hey .
steve !
helen cantera , five @-@ o !
if ella &apos;s in there with you , you need to let her go right ...
gun !
any sign of ella ?
she &apos;s not here .
she knew , danny .
she knew , and she chose to take her own life
rather than tell us where ella is .
must have come off ella &apos;s wrist
when she was in the trunk .
as far as the property is concerned ,
hpd has searched this place top to bottom ,
and so far there &apos;s no sign that ella was ever here .
maybe cantera has her stashed someplace else
until the heat dies down .
it &apos;s possible , but amanda morris was held prisoner for ten years .
assuming cantera kept her here ,
why is there no signs of that either ?
guys ?
there &apos;s something inside you need to see .
all right , so &quot; cop &quot; was definitely not
the only role in cantera &apos;s repertoire .
look at this-- nurse , paramedic , nun .
those are all people a child would trust .
all right , if cantera &apos;s got this many disguises ,
that means she &apos;s done this more than twice .
yeah . so , we &apos;re dealing with what ,
a serial abductor ?
a serial abductor who traffics children for profit .
there &apos;s 40 grand in there easy .
well , that explains why , after ten years , there &apos;s no evidence
of amanda ever having been here .
cantera kidnapped her for somebody else .
and now that same person has ella .
you must be hungry .
i made you a sandwich .
i &apos;m not hungry . i want to go home .
you are home , sweetie .
may i join you ?
i &apos;m sorry he had to do that to you .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re scared ,
and you probably miss your parents a lot .
but there &apos;s something i need you to know .
your mommy and daddy were in a very bad accident .
i want to see them .
i &apos;m sorry , honey .
you can &apos;t .
ever again .
they &apos;re in heaven .
and we &apos;re your family now .
this just in .
big development in the ella bishop case .
investigators have identified
a local woman who they believe
to be the suspected kidnapper .
we &apos;re being told her name is helen cantera ,
and that hpd raided her residence just hours ago .
authorities are still at the scene combing through evidence
in order to locate the missing girl .
in other news , the transit authority says
the h @-@ 1 will reopen tomorrow morning .
proposed roadwork will proceed .
i ran background on helen cantera .
she &apos;s originally from arizona .
she moved to the island back in october of 2002 .
less than a year later , amanda morris goes missing .
so , more than likely , cantera kidnapped both our victims .
yeah , and who knows how many
other kids during that time .
all right , get hpd everything that you have on cantera .
and see if they can link her to any
open kidnapping cases .
okay . sorry . i got to take this .
yeah .
hey . are you alone ?
yeah .
good .
listen , i &apos;m e @-@ mailing you a full intel package
on riku sato .
you were right about him being connected to the yakuza .
guy &apos;s what they call an oyabun .
that means he &apos;s a boss of one of the families .
sato &apos;s been linked to over a dozen murders .
politicians , heads of rival criminal syndicates .
he also used to be in business
with adam &apos;s father , hiro noshimuri ,
back when hiro was a power player in the yakuza .
and , kono , there &apos;s more .
japanese police have been monitoring sato &apos;s compound
in osaka for months .
check the last entry in their surveillance logs .
adam &apos;s there .
he arrived two days ago .
kono ,
this may be none of my business ,
but if your boyfriend is getting into business
with the head of the yakuza ,
i really think you need to tell steve .
hey , cath ? uh , sorry . i have to go .
i just dumped cantera &apos;s cell phone .
listen to the voice mail she received this morning .
it &apos;s done . meet me at 9 : 00 tonight .
and bring the cash .
cash ? cash for what ?
number traces back to a david parsons .
he works in the vital records division of the hawaii department of health .
over the years he created a total of 21
false identities for cantera &apos;s victims .
i forwarded everything to the
fbi &apos;s human trafficking division .
they &apos;re gonna start tracking those kids down now .
check this out .
the last false identity he created was for ella .
she was put into the system
under the name lisa beckett .
here &apos;s the thing , though--
the parents listed on the birth certificate
are ray and terry beckett .
and we verified they &apos;re an actual married couple
living in makaha .
and that &apos;s not all .
records show that they &apos;ve also been collecting welfare benefits
on an older daughter named jessica beckett for the past ten years .
amanda .
and the benefits run out in november when she turns 18 .
that &apos;s why they got rid of amanda
and brought in ella .
they need a minor in there to keep the money flowing .
five @-@ o.
where &apos;s the girl ?
you &apos;re interrupting my lunch .
hang on . i got this .
ma &apos;am , stay where you are . put your hands up .
ma &apos;am , put your hands up and don &apos;t move .
okay , you , get up .
up . up , up , up .
hands behind your back .
get up , stand up .
hands behind your back , hands behind your back .
nothing .
i guess whatever you &apos;re looking for &apos;s not here .
shut up .
danny .
i want to see a warrant .
shut up .
where is she ?
where is she ?
okay .
all right .
you don &apos;t want to talk about ella .
let &apos;s talk about amanda , then , okay ?
who &apos;s amanda ?
who &apos;s amanda ? amanda ...
is a little innocent girl that you kept prisoner here
in your house for ten years .
all so you could collect $ 500 in welfare benefits .
i mean , i don &apos;t understand . doesn &apos;t make any sense to me .
y @-@ you could &apos;ve ... you could &apos;ve made that same amount ,
uh , recycling tin cans .
i can &apos;t work .
i &apos;m on disability .
oh , you &apos;re on disability .
that &apos;s good .
explain to me &apos; cause i don &apos;t understand .
how would it ... how would it go ? child services ,
they come by , uh , you let that little girl out of her cage ,
put on a little act ? a little show ?
huh ? is that how it went ?
i mean , how much fear did you have to instill
in that little kid to keep her mouth shut , huh ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re anything like your husband .
to him , these girls were just a payday , but ...
... i think you cared about them .
the way this place is decorated ,
all the gifts , the books .
he didn &apos;t do this .
you did all this , right ?
but if you really care about ella , you need to tell me
where she is right now
or she &apos;s gonna end up like amanda .
you understand ?
wait a minute . wait , wait , wait .
ray didn &apos;t tell you what he did to amanda , did he ?
you &apos;re trying to trick me .
oh , my god .
look at the photograph .
look at it .
she was about to turn 18 .
he had no use for her anymore .
what &apos;d you think he was gonna do , let her go ?
if i &apos;d have known ...
if you &apos;d have known what ?
you wouldn &apos;t have done anything .
that &apos;s not true .
prove it .
where &apos;s ella ?
you took ella away in your truck this afternoon .
you told your wife
that you needed to hide her
until things cooled down .
so why don &apos;t you just tell us right now where ella is , all right ?
last chance . where is she ?
why would i give up the only leverage i &apos;ve got right now ?
leverage ?
danny !
you can &apos;t do that to me .
you &apos;re cops !
give me your badge .
give me the badge .
that &apos;s 400 yards out from the road .
this is where ray said it would be .
marker right here . here &apos;s his marker .
hey , everybody ! right over here !
look around . everybody , right around here .
hey , guys , over here !
ella !
ella !
hey , get a shovel here ! come on .
bring some shovels .
come on , come on come on come on .
ella , can you hear us ?
ella ?
ella ?
ella ?
ella .
come here , sweetie . come here .
you &apos;re okay . i got you .
we got you . you okay ?
you all right ?
anything hurt ?
you okay , babe ?
you all right ?
let &apos;s get you out of here . come on .
let &apos;s go home .
ella !
ella !
ella .
some things i can remember more than others .
like my house on kaaholo street .
my bike in the driveway
with the pink tassels on the handlebars .
mom &apos;s face i &apos;ll never forget .
it &apos;s there when i look in the mirror .
when i was little , people would say how much i looked like her .
dad only comes in glimpses .
sitting on his lap while he read books to me .
how big his hands were next to mine .
the way his cologne smelled .
those memories are all i have left .
they tell me my parents are dead , but i don &apos;t believe it .
i know they &apos;re still alive
and they still love me .
