This is on you, Raymond.
You were wrong to make her believe
you could keep her safe.
She left behind a little girl. She'll need protection.
Only if you're in her life.
I won't let you make the same mistake with her
that you made with Liz.
Who attacked us at the church?
I don't know.
Whoever employed Solomon's services,
they know too much.
They're breathing down our necks even now,
listening, watching.
We need to put down the threat quickly.
Oh, I know. I know
I wish there was something I could say
to stop your tears...
...to take away the pain of losing her,
but I can't.
What I can do is remind you of how lucky we were
to have had Elizabeth in our lives.
I need to see some ID.
What does the Lord ask of us?
To do justice, love mercy,
and walk humbly with our God.
Reddington's guys?
Yeah. Not that I asked them to be here.
They're here for her protection.
Yeah, well, I don't want Reddington or his goons
to be any part of her life.
I know.
Please tell me you know how to swaddle a baby.
I hear bourbon works.
Did Elizabeth do justice?
She came into our lives under extraordinary circumstances
that few agents could hold up under.
But she did more than hold up.
She thrived.
You look nice.
She withstood scrutiny from her peers,
false accusations from her government,
and helped take down some of the worst criminals
this country has ever known.
Agent Ressler, it's time.
Code red! Code red! All units, please respond.
We're under heavy fire.
Bearcat, don't dismount there. Shut it down.
Wait, who the hell are these guys?
We can't be late.
We gotta find them.
Yeah, and we will, just not now. We have to go.
Did she love mercy?
I've never met anyone more forgiving.
Elizabeth followed her heart,
and against all odds, it led her back to the man she loved.
Did she walk humbly with her God?
I'll never forget the day I met her.
It was her first day on the job.
She had been offered an opportunity
that most agents wait a lifetime to get.
"Why me?" she asked.
"I'm nobody special."
I think we all know different.
She was humble, self-effacing,
and very, very special.
Like all of you, I'm sad and angry.
Like you also,
I'm also very blessed
to have known Elizabeth.
So as we leave here today,
let's celebrate.
The last few days, many have come up to me
and they've said, "We are so sorry for your loss."
But we haven't lost Elizabeth.
We know exactly where she is.
♬Poor old granddad♬
♬I laughed at all his words♬
♬I thought he was a bitter man♬
♬He spoke of woman's ways♬
♬They'll trap you, then they use you♬
♬Before you even know♬
♬For love is blind and you're far too kind♬
♬Don't ever let it show♬
♬I wish that I knew what I know now♬
♬When I was younger♬
♬I wish that I knew what I know now♬
I can't believe Reddington didn't come.
I can. He knows this is his fault.
Hey, Aram, that download -- how far along are you...
Don't judge. I'm just...
I'm just super stressed out.
Oh, you're kidding me, right?
It's legal in D.C.
I feel horrible.
Well, you should. It's a funeral.
I feel so badly for Tom.
I keep thinking maybe there's something
we should do for him.
We?
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,
for thine is the kingdom, the power,
and the glory forever.
Amen.
Amen.
Wait. I need to -- I need to say something.
"When she shall die...
"take her...
"and cut her out in little stars,
"and she will make the face of heaven so fine
"that all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun."
"Romeo and Juliet."
Agent Keen loved Shakespeare.
And Dr. Seuss.
She loved dim sum and -- and Beyoncé,
and those little wooden, uh, foot massagers
that go under your desk.
I know the things she loved
because we were friends.
Even though I called her "Agent Keen,"
that was out of the respect I had for her.
Her friends also called her Liz.
I miss you, Liz. Just --
Okay. Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Your granddaughter.
She's...
I'm sorry.
第三季第二十集

We are not standing down.
And don't give me protocol
about investigating the death of a colleague.
Then how about you're too close, too emotional, and too raw
to come within a country mile of doing a good job finding
who attacked Agent Keen's wedding?
We have to do something.
Yes, you do. Find Reddington.
He'll turn up. He always does.
No, he always did because of Keen.
Now his cooperation was predicated on her.
Now that she's gone, does he intend to continue?
I don't have a clue.
Well, then you need to get one.
We made a deal with the most wanted man in America.
It'd be nice to know if he's planning to honor it.
And Keen?
You worry about Reddington.
We've assigned top agents to her case.
Who?
Top...agents.
Come on, they really expect us to stand down?
Yeah, that's not happening. Where are we?
All right, whoever was after Agent Keen
hacked into a telecom hub.
The servers in that basement were sifting data
intercepted from the fiber optic cables.
Sifting it and sending it where?
I don't know.
Once they realized we'd figured out what they were doing,
they pulled the plug and -- and severed all communications.
But we know what they were looking for -- Keen.
They were watching her.
Right. Yes.
Watching and listening through
private security cameras...
traffic cams.
Someone was watching the attack on the church, in real time.
She never stood a chance.
They were following her the whole time.
And you have no idea where this information was being sent?
Who was tracking her?
I'm tracing the packet routes, but it's...
it's gonna take time.
What I do know is that, uh, Agent Keen
wasn't the only person they were monitoring.
Uh, they were intercepting cell and CCTV footage
out of the Warwick Hotel in Midtown,
along with voice and internet traffic
out of something called the, uh, Global Financial Council.
How is that connected to Keen?
I don't know. It's...
There's so many pieces to sort through. It's...
This is the sort of thing Mr. Reddington would just see
without even blinking.
Thank you.
As soon as the name "Masha Rostova"
hit the 24-hour news cycle, they came for her.
I thought I could... protect her.
I did protect her, all these years.
I've anticipated almost every threat.
But this one...
A medical complication in childbirth.
Masha had a child?
A girl.
She was born prematurely, but she's expected to be fine.
Well, that's wonderful.
Now I am a great-grandfather.
I came here to tell you that.
Sure. I'm sure you did.
Right there on your desk calendar.
Okay, so we...
tuck, then we fold from the bottom.
Just tuck, fold....
Crap. I don't know.
You know, I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking, "Dad, you suck at this."
But I'm telling you...
I can do this.
I think.
Okay, I've got something.
All right, one of the cellphones being tapped belongs
to an executive assistant named Amanda Bigelow,
the other to an Anthony Mayhew,
a chauffeur.
Both work for an executive who's staying
at our third point of reference,
the Warwick Hotel,
while in New York to speak at a conference
held by reference point number four,
the Global Financial Council.
So the common denominator is the executive.
Benjamin Stalder.
President of the Energy Consortium Group.
If the same people who monitored Liz are monitoring him,
he could be the key to finding Liz's killers.
Or he could be their next target.
What the hell are you doing?
What?
You're clearing her out
like she's been evicted from a monthly rental.
Have some respect.
Standard procedure is
to secure the effects of a terminated party --
Get out. Now.
Hey! You two, out now.
Donald.
You believe this?
They're just doing their job.
Why don't you take a break?
I'm gonna collect Agent Keen's effects myself.
Vultures.
I'd imagine it to be a challenge,
playing Rachmaninoff's C-sharp minor "Prelude"
without the benefit of C-sharp.
It would be...
if I played anymore.
Why are you still here?
I'm not entirely sure I know.
Sympathy?
Excuse me?
Are you waiting for my sympathy?
Maybe a hug.
God, no.
Good, because you wouldn't find that here anyway.
I just needed to be someplace...
quiet.
Well, I wasn't expecting you.
I have to go to town for groceries.
I'm sorry for the intrusion.
Let me give you some money, please.
Could you pick up a single malt?
Preferably from the Highlands, but not Islay.
The water there tastes like seaweed and iodine.
♬Traveling through the graveyard♬
♬With a suitcase full of sparks♬
♬Honey, I'm just trying to find my way to you♬
♬Lit up every campfire♬
♬I found out in the dark♬
♬All the countless days along the sea of blue♬
♬Learned the language of the Mockingbird♬
♬She took and twisted all my words♬
♬Yeah, I'm just trying to find my way to you♬
♬And I'll meet you in the graveyard♬
♬With the winter trees and stars♬
What can you tell me
about the mother's family medical history?
♬Open up this suitcase full of sparks♬
Nothing.
And neither could she. They died when she was young.
What about Elizabeth herself?
Any cancer, heart disease, diabetes?
No. Look...
Doctor, is something wrong with my baby?
Agnes is just fine.
But the more genetic blanks I can fill in the charts,
you know, the better I know what to screen for.
What about your family?
More blanks.
I never knew my parents either.
I think that's what made Liz and I work.
You know, it was the first time either of us felt like...
...family.
Excuse me.
Cooper.
It's Tom Keen.
Tom, I'm glad you called.
I just collected a box of personal things from Liz's office.
All right. I'll come pick 'em up now.
Look, maybe I could...
...work on the case
while I'm there, because I'm... I'm useless here.
We have things under control.
No. See, that's the problem, all right?
The situation doesn't call for control.
The only way we're gonna find the bastards who came after Liz
is if we sink to their level.
Tom, stop. Just be with your child.
We have a solid lead, and we're working it now.
I don't care how well the stock was doing before.
It's imploding now.
It's a classic pump and dump.
We need to liquidate immediately.
No -- Wait, hang on. Front desk is calling.
I think my driver's here.
I gotta head over to the conference.
Dump that stock, Lawrence!
Stalder's not answering. Keep trying the room.
We're almost there,
but I need hotel security to find him and secure him.
Agent Navabi, I have eyes on Mr. Stalder
approaching the elevator.
He's got two of his own men with him,
and I see his driver down here in the lobby.
He's good.
Rolling Thunder, this is Operator 4-6.
Unicorn is at the elevators.
Roger that. We are 15 seconds from location.
Asset is on site, ready for extraction.
Agent Navabi. Where's Stalder?
Elevator 2, landing any second.
Come on. Come on.
Gone.
What floor did it stop on?
7.
And where do those stairs lead?
West alley service entrance, end of that corridor.
All right, let me take the alley.
Okay.
FBI! Freeze! On the ground! On the gro--
Abort! We got FBI! Go! Go! Go!
You have no right to go through her things.
And that's my coat!
I was just imagining
young Katarina covered in glitter.
As an adult, it's easy to dismiss this stuff
as girlish frivolity.
You forget the wonder it creates,
the light captured, secret wishes evoked.
It renders even the darkest days sparkly.
Never underestimate the power of glitter.
Stop it.
Stop what?
Stop... torturing me.
That was never my intention.
Then what are you doing out here?
These boxes are all I have...
all I have left of my daughter.
I'm sorry, Dom. I understand.
No, you don't. You don't understand.
You think because Masha's dead,
now you -- you can understand me?
You can -- you can share my misery?
I feel bereft, just like you.
No, not just like me.
She's gone because of choices you made for both of them.
First Katarina and then Masha.
As far as I'm concerned, you killed my entire family!
No, you're not like me.
Nez Rowan? You're sure it was her?
I had a pretty good angle on her face
as she cracked me with the butt of her weapon. It's her.
How is that even possible? We had her dead to rights
for the armed robbery of a nuclear facility,
conspiracy to kidnap, accessory to murder.
I personally signed the paperwork
for her transfer to Fort Meade to await trial.
So why isn't she rotting in a cell?
I'll have Aram look into it.
Aram is taking a personal day today.
He's not dealing with Liz's death very well.
He's not alone.
I'll look into the Rowan situation myself.
Look, she's definitely working with the same team of mercs
who tried to abduct Keen.
Rowan's extraction team outside the hotel today --
they wore the exact same equipment as they did.
Okay, well, let's find out from Mr. Stalder
why they're after him and how he connects to Liz.
I run the Energy Consortium Group.
We advise governments and private sector clients
on energy and economic business models.
I recommend who gets billion-dollar contracts
and who doesn't. So --
That's why you travel with such a heavy security contingent.
Yeah. That's right.
I've received plenty of death threats over the years.
We'll need any record you have of those,
along with a complete client list.
Of course.
Did anything unusual happen today,
before the abduction?
No. I never left the suite.
I was working on my speech for the Global Financial Council.
Can you think of any reason
why someone would want to stop that speech?
No. It was just a general state of the industry address.
Mr. Stalder,
do you have any connection with Elizabeth Keen?
The fugitive. Right?
Uh, no, only what I hear in the news.
Whatever happened to her, anyway?
That's not where the capers go.
Dom...
Move.
You still have family.
Who? The baby?
I won't live long enough to see her out of nappies.
If I'm allowed to see her at all.
I had to make do with photographs of Masha.
Did you even tell her about me?
I couldn't.
You know how complicated it was.
There was nothing complicated about it.
We had to back out of Masha's life to keep her safe,
after you made a colossal mess of everything.
Only you couldn't stay well enough away, could you?
Now you -- you come to my house with this sorry tale of loss,
like you're the only one affected by this.
You're the only one whose feelings matter.
Well, guess what, Raymond?
Masha was my granddaughter, and now she's dead
without even knowing I existed!
All my sacrifices shot to hell.
I could've spent the last 30 years
just being her grandfather...
You selfish prick.
She had your temper.
I loved that girl enough to let her go,
which is more than you can say.
Did my office send you what you wanted?
Yes. We have your client list. We're running them down now.
But we need to go over your abduction one more time.
We've been over it six times.
I can't stay here. I have to fly to Dubai tonight.
Listen, Mr. Stalder, leaving now would be a huge mistake.
You're in immediate danger.
My firm contracts with the best security teams
that money can buy.
Now that we're aware of the threat,
I am confident in their ability to keep me safe.
Now I'm sorry, but I have to go.
Do you know who had Nez Rowan released from military custody
three days ago?
Oh, honey, you've come to a goat's house looking for wool.
I warned you, Harold. Stand down.
You know who did it.
Have you found Raymond Reddington?
Damn it, Cynthia.
Nez Rowan was part of a shadow army
that left directly to the death of Agent Keen.
Rowan was the best lead we have. Who let her go free?
I don't know. It's over my head.
What I can tell you
is that there are certain U.S. Government missions.
Covert. Dangerous. Necessary.
And they require the expertise of an independent organization.
Don't patronize me.
Those people got one of my best agents killed,
and you expect me to walk away.
How can I justify that?
I know full well you look the other way when you need to,
because working with an international criminal
enables you to bring good to the world.
I can't look the other way.
Not this time.
They took someone that I love.
Best thing you can do for all of us
is locate Reddington
and find a way to keep him on your team.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Yeah.
You ready to roll in the mud?
Thought you'd never ask.
Surprise.
Dembe...
Please don't be mad at him.
Dembe understood how important this is,
and you weren't answering his calls,
or I-I never would have dropped by unannounced.
It's rude, and... I hate to be rude.
What do you want, Aram?
You need to come back with me.
Why?
We're not getting anywhere.
In the investigation of... Agent Keen's death.
We could use your help.
Harold Cooper is a very capable leader.
He'll sort it out.
It's more than that.
I can't work. The Post Office,
without Agent Keen...
Without you...
it's just a government building.
I'm sorry you came all the way out here for nothing, Aram.
I can't help you.
You gave me a speech over an empty grave,
about the foundational elements in our lives.
"People who form the brick and mortar
of who we are."
How, when they're suddenly not there, we...
we collapse into rubble.
Now it was after Agent Keen was almost killed by the Cabal.
But I saved her.
You looked into that empty grave back then and said
you'd be staring at her if it weren't for me.
Now I understand why you have collapsed into rubble.
I do,
and I'm truly sorry.
But I'm here to collect on your debt.
You owe me.
So let's go.
To pay...
m-my debt to you
would require more than I possess.
I'm not coming back.
If Reddington's not coming back for Keen,
he's not coming back, period.
Okay, so what's our next move?
Aram, did you have any luck with those servers from the basement?
I thought I'd be able to figure out
where they routed their data,
but I couldn't find the end of the proxy chain.
Well, they have to be bouncing it off
some kind of hidden servers around the Earth.
Or hidden servers... over the Earth.
I checked all the viable telecom satellites in GEO and LEO orbit,
but I didn't check the offline ones.
Offline satellites?
Yeah, there are thousands
of unused and decommissioned satellites
circling our heads -- space junk.
It's not enough that we litter the planet.
Okay, the challenge is to figure out which ones they used.
Agent Mojtabai.
Agent Mojtabai...
Welcome back.
Don't you dare!
How do you drink this stuff?
We drank it with every meal on the farm when I was a boy.
But we had cows, and we made our own.
In the summers, we made buttermilk pops in the freezer.
Kept us all from passing out.
So buttermilk reminds you of home.
I overheard your conversation with the Arab boy.
He's from Delaware.
You won't be troubled again with unexpected visitors.
I know how you value your privacy.
Why didn't you go with him?
What would be the point?
There's nothing I could do that would really matter.
Cry me a river. Hmm?
What the hell are you really doing here?
You -- you gave me the news about Masha.
What do you want from me?
A way forward.
I can't live for long with what I feel inside.
I don't see how anyone can.
You said it, chum.
Look around here. You call this living?
After I lost my daughter...
I crawled...
crawled into the wilderness
like a mortally wounded animal
to get as far away from the pack as I could,
to -- to run out the clock.
Run out the clock and die. And...
If you came for a survival manual,
you won't find it here.
But you -- you've got one thing I haven't had for a long time.
You've got a reason -- a reason to walk out that door.
It sounds to me like there are honest people out there
who are depending upon you to...
God help them.
God help them.
Dom, you've always had a good reason to walk out the door.
Okay, I think I'm getting somewhere.
So you found the needle in the haystack?
I'm not looking for a needle. We need the whole haystack.
And if I'm right,
it's the Artax Network.
What is that?
It's an old telecom project to provide data coverage
to every corner of the Earth
through a network of 73 satellites.
Anyway, the company went bankrupt
and the project was abandoned.
But the 73 satellites are still out there.
You think our target is using them?
Is there any way to confirm that the network's still active?
Well, I've just gained access to a relay station,
and I am about to lock onto one of the satellites.
If it's in use, the data will be encrypted,
but... we'll know if it's active.
Okay.
Here we go.
They have control of the Artax satellite network.
And they used it to kill Liz.
All right. Can we use it to find them?
Okay, so I was able to get a location by examining
the latency patterns in the satellite signal.
They're being fed to 2054 Pulaski Avenue.
Concrete panels with granite faces.
We've got no line-of-sight inside.
Only one point of entry.
Then only one point of egress.
Lock it up tight after we breach.
HQ, this is Operator 4-6.
We have poachers at the Eagle's Nest.
Initiating the protocol.
They're in.
Other than Nez, we can't put faces to any of the mercs.
So I scrubbed through the Warwick's security footage
to try and find some.
Good job. What'd you get us?
Nothing. Um, at least no mercs.
But I did find this...
A shot of our victim.
One hour before his abduction.
Stalder told Ressler and Navabi he never left his suite.
Was he lying or did he just forget?
Well, that doesn't look like a woman --
or a conversation -- he'd have forgotten.
Who is she?
I don't know. And we can't ask Stalder.
I checked. He just cleared U.S. airspace.
They're onto the 11th floor. Go.
15 seconds and counting.
All right, do a full vertical sweep.
They're somewhere in this building.
So much for evidence.
Raymond?
Raymond!
Thank you for having dinner with me.
It was nice.
You're welcome to come inside.
No.
Not tonight, but maybe we can have dinner again.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
Huh? Yeah, I know.
Wait. Shh.
It's okay. Shh.
What did you say?
Oh, come here.
I did it. I did it, huh?
I got you. I got you.
We did it.
Yeah, we did.
Tell me you found something useful.
Depends. I followed Panabaker to the airport,
where she had a meeting on the tarmac with this woman.
That's the woman that Stalder met at the hotel
just an hour before his attempted abduction.
Who's Stalder?
Benjamin Stalder.
A high-powered executive at an energy consortium.
Whoever was tracking Liz was also going after him.
Why?
I don't know. We let him go,
but I'm getting the distinct feeling that was a mistake.
Stalder's obviously more involved than he was letting on.
So who is this woman?
We don't know yet.
The hotel photo wasn't much to go on,
but with these new images,
Aram should be able to locate her in one of our databases.
Liz was convinced that her mother was
the one who tried to kidnap her.
Reddington said she died years ago,
but Liz didn't believe that, and neither do I.
I think we're staring at Katarina Rostova.
Mr. Reddington.
I'm here to pay my debt to you, Aram.
You're back.
Strap on your bike and helmet, we're going to work.
