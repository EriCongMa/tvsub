kristie taylor runaway drug addict
reported missing from farmington new mexico 3 years ago .
yesterday she turned up off a freeway
outside of rio rancho .
sexual assault combined with ligature marks on her wrists and ankles .
she was asphyxiated .
3 victims in 5 years .
all the women are connected by marks .
he likes chains .
definite sexual sadist .
he sticks to his type .
16- to 19 @-@ year @-@ old girls all blond .
hangs on to them for a while too .
look at this . average of 2 years
between abducting them and killing them .
low body count long time frame .
this guy &apos;s in control of his urges .
too controlled .
sadists need new victims new ways to torture .
there are a lot of guys out there who like chains .
are we sure this is the same unsub ?
kristie taylor &apos;s autopsy report
also indicates a second connection between these victims .
she was pregnant .
she &apos;d given birth . very soon after the unsub killed her .
how soon after ?
minutes .
this unsub isn &apos;t your typical sexual sadist .
captivity and assault we &apos;ve seen before .
what we haven &apos;t seen is this signature ...
the role he forces these women
to fulfill before he kills them .
motherhood .
journalist william d. tammeus wrote
&quot; you don &apos;t really understand human nature
&quot; unless you know why a child on a merry @-@ go @-@ round
&quot; will wave at his parents every time around
and why his parents will always wave back . &quot;
so why would a sexual sadist make women carry his children ?
gary heidnik kept a harem in a dungeon .
his goal was to create a large family
as a replacement for his own broken home .
josef fritzl kept his daughter
in a cell in his own house
and they had several kids together .
squalid conditions are part
of a control fantasy these men had .
if he &apos;s keeping these women in a similar location
he &apos;d need a lot of privacy .
he probably built it himself .
makes him good with his hands .
why blondes and what significance do they have to him ?
maybe uh the woman who rejected him
or the woman who wouldn &apos;t bear his children ?
if that were true he &apos;d be the same age as these girls ...
late teens .
this unsub is too skilled for that .
his own mother then ?
she could be a runaway just like these victims .
which makes his compulsion psych 101 ...
killing his mother over and over again for giving birth to him .
yeah but then why wait until after she gives birth ?
now he has a body and a baby to get rid of .
that troubles me too . we found the mothers but not the infants .
uh i hate to say this
but what if the women are just a means to an end ?
what if the babies are really the ones he &apos;s exploiting ?
if kristie taylor just surfaced
it means he has her baby right now .
jj check with the parents .
see if there are any similarities in the runaways &apos; patterns
where the unsub &apos;s finding them .
reid and prentiss go to the latest dump site .
we need to look at victimology .
how he treats these women in the final moments of their lives
might tell us what he &apos;s doing to the children .
doctor you wrote in your report
that kristie had several miscarriages .
how was that evident ?
there were a number of abrasions in her uterine lining .
around the third trimester her water would break .
so she never carried to term ?
no last time she did .
there was a high level of pitocin in her blood .
it &apos;s an artificial hormone . you give it to induce labor .
she was on a tight schedule ?
if she lost the baby he would get her pregnant again immediately .
childbirth is tough enough .
imagine if your life depends upon it .
all 3 moms had records .
drug abuse drunk and disorderlies .
but what &apos;s more interesting is what he does after he kidnaps them .
this is kristie taylor 2 weeks before she was abducted .
he got her healthy .
well @-@ fed and off the habit .
not completely .
these drugs in kristie &apos;s system ... what are they ?
tamoxifen metoclopramide
domperidone progesterone .
progesterone &apos;s a prenatal medication isn &apos;t it ?
they all are . the first 2 help carry the baby to term .
the last 2 help with lactation .
what kind of sexual sadist
gives his victims prenatal drugs ?
the kind who takes care of the kids he &apos;s having .
he gets his rocks off killing the moms
but the babies he protects .
you think he &apos;s keeping them ?
if he despises the moms
he &apos;d despise their children too .
new mexico &apos;s right on the border .
a lot of human trafficking going on .
this tight schedule he keeps the moms on ...
he could be breeding .
call child protection services .
we need to find out about existing black markets for infants .
thank you .
there &apos;s no tire tracks .
the body wasn &apos;t dumped that far from the road .
this guy doesn &apos;t care about them
not enough to even hide them very well .
that &apos;s why this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
dump sites reveal something about the unsub you know ?
at the very least a geographic familiarity
a place he knows he won &apos;t get caught .
ok so he knows this road .
yeah except he abducted kristie in farmington
and then dumps her here in rio rancho .
it &apos;s a 175 @-@ mile drive .
why drive that far just to dump a body by the side of the road ?
a forensic countermeasure ?
covering his tracks by sheer distance ?
so the geographical profile won &apos;t do us much good .
no it will
just not with the victims .
we profiled that it &apos;s the babies that he &apos;s interested in .
that &apos;s where he &apos;ll reveal himself .
the adoption company he sells through
and whatever network of resources he uses .
he makes shortcuts there for convenience .
no one &apos;s gonna drive 100 miles for diapers
or for a public notary for legal paperwork .
if the babies are in the system they &apos;ll lead us to him .
child trafficking is huge in other countries
but here it &apos;s mostly a myth .
why is that ?
there &apos;s an easier and legal path ...
adoption .
there &apos;d be a paper trail though wouldn &apos;t there ?
there are ways to hide your tracks .
there must be a way to identify all these kids .
there &apos;s a court record for every adoption .
give us the records .
we &apos;ll start weeding them out by date .
the adoptions in this state are closed .
the files are sealed . so it &apos;ll take time .
that &apos;s a luxury we don &apos;t have .
there &apos;s a child at risk right now .
all children who go in and out of the adoption system
get basic genetic screenings for pre @-@ existing conditions .
we have their dna .
we can use that . we can match the maternal dna
with the babies in the system .
we &apos;re still talking hundreds of kids .
what if we give you one of the babies &apos; dna ?
that would make it go faster yeah .
he kills these moms so soon after they give birth
secondary dna could still be on their bodies .
i &apos;ll call the m.e.
i understand . thank you doctor .
agent jareau ?
i &apos;m conrad winmar .
this is my wife jane .
thank you for coming in .
why don &apos;t we talk privately ?
you ... you want to dig up our daughter ?
we think the unsub might have left dna on her .
the last 2 victims didn &apos;t have any
but because monica was the first
he might have made a mistake .
back when they found her
the detectives said that they did not find his dna .
it &apos;s not his dna we &apos;re looking for .
we suspect your daughter gave birth while she was captive .
what ?
the unsub has gotten all of his victims pregnant .
he might be putting the babies
in the adoption system .
the baby &apos;s alive ?
possibly .
if we could find placental tissue on monica
we can test the dna
against the state &apos;s records .
give us the release .
the first time i saw her saw her record too .
thought she was just another girl on the street
not caring what she did to herself .
i never even thought to look for this .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a baby &apos;s umbilical cord .
the child should be about 4 now .
i hope you find him or her .
i really do .
thank you .
ok know this ...
most adoption folk are like the nicest
most dedicated people in the world .
there are however one or two skeezy ones .
how skeezy ?
super skeezy . i &apos;ve got a spread sheet from one of them
expecting compensation for the baby i &apos;m having .
something you want to tell me garcia ?
oh that &apos;s the sad part my prince .
the genetically perfect offspring
of penelope garcia and derek morgan
wouldn &apos;t fetch top dollar .
who does ?
white babies are in higher demand
than minorities .
boys are more popular than girls
at least this year anyway .
and then there &apos;s the swedish supermodel rule .
the what ?
if i were to deliver a blond @-@ haired blue @-@ eyed bundle of joy
i &apos;d be set for life . i would .
garcia did the baby &apos;s dna
turn up in new mexico &apos;s adoption records ?
no . there &apos;s no hits on her profile .
and it is a her by the way .
this unsub could still be selling babies
just not through the system .
that &apos;s gonna make him a lot harder to catch .
all right . it &apos;s late .
let &apos;s get some rest . we &apos;ll hit this fresh in the morning .
garcia out .
morgan .
i &apos;d like for you to write up a preliminary profile .
we don &apos;t have enough for that .
well that &apos;s why it &apos;s preliminary .
a work in progress profile helps show us what we &apos;re missing .
ok .
sure .
how you holding up ?
we just wasted a day looking into a black market
that probably doesn &apos;t exist .
that &apos;s not what i mean .
i &apos;ve heard whispers .
you &apos;re getting some heat .
i &apos;m taking care of it .
so you uh think we have a tunnel vision problem ?
i think we &apos;d like to believe
that we could save those kids
but look what he does to the mothers .
a lot of anger .
he &apos;s probably doing the same thing to the children .
his own children .
maybe .
garcia said something interesting .
blond @-@ haired blue @-@ eyed babies get top dollar
in the adoption system .
all the mothers ...
have blond hair and blue eyes .
you &apos;re gonna love this .
this guy he has like the best .
like there is no better .
he has like this access to god .
he doesn &apos;t want to hang on to it .
he wants to give it away .
how much further ?
not much .
because that &apos;s what god &apos;s love is you know it &apos;s sharing .
it &apos;s giving everything you have of yourself away
and not expecting anything in return .
where are we ?
right here baby
right where we need to be .
she &apos;s good right ?
that &apos;s the kind of chick you want ?
she &apos;s perfect .
i know it &apos;s a long shot
but monica &apos;s parents
said that she was heading west .
maybe she made it part of the way when she was kidnapped .
so why not run her dna against adoption records in surrounding states ?
are you kidding ? i think you &apos;re brilliant .
hey jj if we find this little girl
what &apos;s gonna happen to her ?
if something illegal transpires
during the adoption process the court nullifies it
the child gets returned to the closest blood relative .
if it helps
i have met with the grandparents .
they &apos;re wonderful people .
oh i &apos;m sure they are .
it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t know i ...
i lost my parents .
granted i was older than she is but ...
what got me through were the people closest to me and ...
if monica &apos;s daughter is with a good family
and we take her away from them ...
are we doing more harm than good ?
yeah .
garcia i don &apos;t think we have a choice .
these people have a right to their granddaughter .
you &apos;re right .
yeah .
this sucks .
yes right away please .
thank you .
hey . i just called cps
asked them to send over infant mortality files .
another group for us to eliminate .
good .
what &apos;s that ?
your profile . i disagree with your analysis .
hotch are you serious ?
it &apos;s not a law review article
it &apos;s just something for us to brainstorm .
but you only focused on one angle morgan
that the prenatal drugs indicate the presence
of a wife or a girlfriend . we need more options .
which i can give you once we make the proper deductions .
hotch you &apos;re asking me to guess .
morgan in order for the profile to be useful
it has to generate multiple scenarios
about what the unsub is doing .
rewrite it .
we got her .
monica winmar &apos;s daughter .
she was adopted 4 years ago .
she &apos;s lisa now .
how did garcia find her ?
she cross @-@ referenced the entire new mexico system .
she wasn &apos;t in new mexico . she was in arizona .
so all the mothers were abducted and dumped in new mexico
but he keeps the babies in arizona .
he knows the police will stop looking at the state line .
the adoption agency &apos;s gonna be our best lead to the unsub .
who handled the case ?
that &apos;s bombshell number 2 .
she didn &apos;t go through an agency .
she was dropped off anonymously at a church .
hospitals and churches are safe havens .
you can drop a baby off no questions asked .
child protection services would look for the closest relative .
another search that ends at the state line .
and if cps doesn &apos;t find one the baby will go into foster care
which is what happened to lisa .
she was lucky . the adoption process
happened within a month .
so this unsub had the opportunity
to make money off this infant .
he doesn &apos;t drops it off at a church
because he knows the state will take good care of it .
that &apos;s awfully considerate .
outside the murders nothing about this unsub &apos;s
behavior profiles like a sexual sadist ...
as i wrote .
yeah morgan &apos;s right .
it &apos;s the actions of a caretaker a mother .
could our unsub be a woman ?
uh only a man would torture his victims this much .
men get off on this kind of violence . women don &apos;t .
he could be married though his wife being
a passive participant taking care of the moms .
and the babies .
all right . we need to split up .
we &apos;ll give the profile to the arizona
and the new mexico state police .
rossi reid and prentiss i want you to head to phoenix .
morgan you &apos;re here with me . we &apos;ll finalize the profile .
how are you feeling ?
terrible .
what are you on ?
what ?
what are you talking about ?
when he takes us we &apos;re all on something .
i was an alcoholic .
so what are you on ?
uh ... crack .
i &apos;m carol .
i &apos;m julie .
here . here &apos;s some water . come drink some .
um ... is this some kind of tough love detox ?
oh what is that ?
it &apos;s like the sun .
it gives us vitamin d.
it keeps us healthy .
well they can &apos;t make us stay here .
hey ! hey let me out !
i want to go home !
i want my clothes ! i want my phone !
let me out of here ! let me out !
why is he doing this ?
what does he want ?
your baby .
i &apos;m not pregnant .
you will be .
the unsubs that we are looking for are a couple .
now the man in the relationship
most likely has a history of sexual violence .
he started with stalking and then moved his way up to assault and rape .
and that violent streak ended temporarily
when he found his wife .
for the first years of their marriage
she submitted to his torture .
look for wives who came into the e.r. repeatedly
and with obvious signs of spousal abuse
but you are gonna have to go back about 5 years .
that &apos;s because around the time of the first abduction
the visits stopped .
the sexual sadist can &apos;t find satisfaction
from a willing participant .
he eventually got to a place where he couldn &apos;t escalate
his violence against her without killing her
so she made him a deal .
he gets to kidnap rape and kill
each of the runaways
and she gets to keep the children .
she &apos;s been giving the victims a series of prescription prenatal drugs .
so you &apos;re gonna want to look at the obstetric fields uh
nurses o.b.s.
the wife needs these children .
at first they were the lifeline that kept her alive .
as long as he had other targets for his abuse
she avoided his rage .
so if these children protect her from abuse
why is she putting them up for adoption ?
we believe the unsubs want children who resemble them physically
who no one would question as their own .
all of the runaways have been blond
which means the unsub may be as well .
but the first child we found in the system was a brunette .
whatever the physical characteristic ...
the color of the eyes the skin type ...
if the baby doesn &apos;t have it
he or she ends up in the foster care system
wives of sexual sadists need outlets
as a denial mechanism to cope with what their partners are doing .
and motherhood especially taking care of a helpless infant
is this woman &apos;s way of coping .
you found her ?
we have .
how is she ?
she &apos;s great .
she was adopted by a young couple .
no reports of physical or emotional trauma .
so when can we take her ?
right now we &apos;re in touch with her adoptive parents &apos; lawyer
but the law is on your side .
can we talk to the parents ?
we could discuss this with them .
they don &apos;t want to initiate contact .
they &apos;ve been through a lot right now .
they &apos;re her parents .
of course they don &apos;t want to give her up .
well if she wants to see them then we can work that out
but we are her family .
yes absolutely .
no wait .
what are the risks here ?
if we claim her are we hurting her ?
it &apos;s impossible to tell .
some kids do great .
others have trouble .
but why are we talking about risks ?
she &apos;s monica &apos;s daughter .
conrad ...
she &apos;s not their blood .
stop it .
thank you agent jareau .
but my husband and i we need to discuss this .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s the pattern i &apos;ve been looking for .
the unsubs hid their tracks with the mothers
but they weren &apos;t so careful with the abandoned babies .
did you find more children ?
dna @-@ wise no but deductively yes .
i gathered all the records for all infants who entered into foster care
in a 2 @-@ week window following each mother &apos;s death .
then i narrowed it down to babies that were abandoned at churches .
this is where the guesswork begins .
monica winmar &apos;s daughter was abandoned at a presbyterian church .
let &apos;s assume the unsub
or the wife at least is presbyterian .
that means all other unwanted children
are gonna be left at the same denomination right ?
that narrows it down to 3 babies
left at 3 different presbyterian churches
all within this 20 @-@ mile radius .
this is where they live .
these kids you deduced to ...
have you looked at their files ?
no . right now i &apos;ve only been tracking churches . why ?
because you just uncovered another pattern .
yeah we &apos;re packing up now .
we can be in phoenix in about 2 hours .
you sure about this ?
the names of the babies reid found tells us everything .
lisa elizabeth amanda .
we profiled there &apos;d be a type they &apos;d keep
and a type they &apos;d put into foster care .
they &apos;re keeping the boys .
it &apos;s time .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ? !
hey where are you going ? come back !
you have to come back ! please !
they never stay for this part .
no no no no . you &apos;re not actually ...
yes ... i am .
they &apos;ve induced .
what am i supposed to do ?
you help me .
1 @-@ 1.000 ...
2 @-@ 1.000 ...
no no no i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t .
3 @-@ 1.000 ...
i can &apos;t help you .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m sick .
i &apos;m not well . i need a ...
i can &apos;t do it .
julie listen to me .
are you listening to me ?
yes . yes .
if this baby doesn &apos;t make it ...
they are going to kill me .
and once they &apos;ve killed me
they are going to move on to you .
do you understand ?
ok .
ok . what do we do ?
jj i need you to call these fertility specialists
and get them over here for interviews .
whoa .
yeah i know .
hotch wants to focus on the prenatal drugs
the unsubs are giving the victims .
he thinks we can build a new suspect pool
and he wants it done yesterday .
there &apos;s 2 pages of names here . shouldn &apos;t we narrow it down ?
jj just do it ok ?
i &apos;m sorry .
is everything ok ?
hotch has been on me ever since we got here
and for the life of me i can &apos;t figure out why .
oh i might know .
the night before hotch picked this case
chief strauss stopped by the b.a.u.
they were behind closed doors
and it seemed like it got a little tense .
well the bureau &apos;s been on him for a while .
he must have known this was gonna happen .
except now they &apos;re making him
justify every decision .
for hotch that &apos;s ... hell .
dr. dekeyser we don &apos;t think
she &apos;s getting these prenatal drugs as a patient .
you &apos;re thinking she &apos;s writing the scrip for these herself .
something like that .
then she wouldn &apos;t be very knowledgeable
about what she &apos;s doing .
some of these drugs have serious side effects .
there &apos;s dozens of meds
i would prescribe before these
all of them more effective .
so why would she use these ?
my guess ... these are the ones she had access to .
fertility drugs are a cocktail
and you keep remixing the cocktail until you get pregnant .
the information is out there on the internet .
she found the right one .
so the woman was prescribed these drugs
maybe for some other illness
and figured out that they helped carry a baby to term .
exactly .
then the real question is
what other diseases do these drugs treat ?
ok . i can do this .
i can do this .
what ?
nothing . you remind me of me .
carol ?
carol please please stay awake .
please ?
ok just ... just focus
on the sound of my voice ok ?
can you do that ?
i &apos;m here .
carol tell me about the woman
who was here before me .
what happened to her ?
she miscarried ...
a lot .
then she gave birth to a girl .
they don &apos;t like girls .
this isn &apos;t your first time is it ?
no .
what happened ?
he didn &apos;t make it .
i &apos;m sorry .
they let you live
even if you lose him .
they want those boys .
ok . ok hey . hey .
listen i don &apos;t know what to do ok
so please please just tell me what to do .
how dilated am i ?
wh @-@ what ? i don &apos;t know what that means .
just put your fingers in a row and ...
measure me .
wait ...
oh my god .
ok ...
oh my god .
ok . um ...
it &apos;s 4 . it &apos;s 4 fingers .
and i ... oh god is that the head ?
oh my god what does that mean ?
it means ...
it &apos;s time to push .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a tactical arrest plan .
i &apos;d like you to write it up for this case .
you want me to write up how we apprehend these unsubs
without risking the lives of the children .
yes .
hotch i &apos;ve led dozens of tactical assaults .
you &apos;ve never made me write up one of these before .
that &apos;s because i always do it for you after each case .
you know what ?
i &apos;m sorry strauss is coming down on you .
this is not about strauss .
really ? i disagree .
look i understand that you &apos;re under the gun .
but i gotta say it . i &apos;m really not all that surprised .
i &apos;ve watched you walk away from
a bunch of cops gunning down unsubs in d.c.
you walked in unprotected to a hostage situation in louisville .
of course the bureau &apos;s worried about you .
man i &apos;m worried about you .
but just because you &apos;re the one who &apos;s under the magnifying glass
that doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t do my job .
morgan there &apos;s a big part of your job
that i do for you .
because i don &apos;t need you worried about paperwork and politics .
i need you in the field and focused and catching the next unsub .
but i can &apos;t do that anymore .
i don &apos;t have to justify my orders to you
and you do have to follow them .
i &apos;ve always followed your orders when they made sense .
well if you have a problem with this one
tell me now .
you &apos;re the boss .
garcia needs to talk to us asap .
ok so the gold star of the day goes to agent david rossi
and his short list of one disease
these prenatal drugs also treat .
breast cancer . progesterone tamoxifen slow the spread
metoclopramide and domperidone ...
are for anti @-@ nausea if i remember correctly .
if this woman has breast cancer
would she be able to get pregnant ?
she could . she &apos;d have to be dedicated .
how dedicated ?
well she &apos;d have to go off chemotherapy .
she &apos;d be in a lot of pain .
but she &apos;ll try anyway .
her whole life is children . that &apos;s her goal .
the first runaway monica winmar
when was she abducted ?
5 years ago .
how many breast cancer patients in arizona
got pregnant 5 to 6 years ago ?
uh let me see .
not a lot . 7 .
how many of those patients are married to a man
with a history of sexual violence ?
just one ... robert and linda reimann .
oh jeez .
what ?
she lost the baby in month 8 .
she had to go through labor anyway .
well that kind of physical and emotional trauma
there &apos;s our stressor .
garcia was the baby a boy ?
yeah . they even named him ... michael .
there has to be a name on the death certificate .
doctors encourage bonding between mothers and stillborns .
i ... volunteer with a new mom counseling group .
they say it helps them cope with feelings of loss .
well this unsub can &apos;t cope
so she &apos;s recreating them .
ok come on you &apos;re almost there . just push .
push !
oh my god .
is it a boy or a girl ?
ha ! it &apos;s a boy .
you &apos;re here .
you made it .
no .
don &apos;t .
no ! no please leave her alone . please !
please please please just wait one minute .

michael .
ok commander this here
is the unsub &apos;s address .
now 5 years ago when the wife lost their child
the husband started paying
for home renovations with his credit card .
shower toilet tile and mesh fencing
which he did not put up in his backyard .
he was building his dungeon .
no permits were filed for additional building on the property
so the entrance must be inside the house .
how many doors are there to cover ?
there &apos;s 2 ... one in the front one in the back .
we have the arrest warrants ?
faxed over 20 minutes ago .
morgan what &apos;s your plan ?
i think we should do a soft entry .
see if we can get the kids out
before the parents even know what &apos;s happening .
you &apos;d be in the door first ?
do you have another idea ?
send prentiss and jj in first .
children are more likely to trust a woman and we need that presence .
we don &apos;t know how many kids are in the house .
i mean the parents could take a hostage .
but if we go in hot
that would definitely happen .
hotch is right .
this is the way .
hi .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok . we &apos;re the police .
we &apos;re the good guys .
can you come outside with me ?
ok . ok .
hotch we &apos;ve got one boy accounted for .
he &apos;s on his way out to you
but there could still be more in the basement .
fbi .
where &apos;s your wife ?
in the nursery .
rossi .
hotch .
go .
i knew this would end .
i always knew you &apos;d come to our door
and take this away .
ma &apos;am why don &apos;t you give me the baby .
we can talk about it .
why would i want to do that ?
what you &apos;ve been doing is wrong .
you must know that .
oh god please please get us out of here !
oh ! oh thank god . thank god .
we &apos;re all clear here .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok you &apos;re safe . come with me .
but no i can &apos;t leave her .
all secure but we need medical .
this is all i have left .
do you understand ?
my husband hates me .
there &apos;s nobody here that can help me with him
with this with any of it .
he &apos;s all i have .
linda .
please .
i need you to think about the baby right now .
you &apos;re suffering from stage 4 breast cancer .
you &apos;ve given your medication to the women
that have been locked up downstairs .
you don &apos;t have a lot of time left .
i know you want somebody who will always remember you don &apos;t you ?
the baby &apos;s name is michael right ?
yeah .
michael will remember you .
he &apos;s gonna know that you helped bring him into the world .
that &apos;s a part of him now .
and he will always ask about you
long after you &apos;re gone .
do you really believe that ?
i do .
i would have been a wonderful mother .
then prove it .
let him go .
where &apos;s my son ?
we &apos;re looking for him .
please don &apos;t let anything happen to him .
look he &apos;s here .
he &apos;s fine .
he &apos;s ok .
you are beautiful aren &apos;t you ?
i spoke with lisa &apos;s adoptive parents .
they &apos;ve agreed to talk to you .
they &apos;re not willing to give up custody
but they do want lisa to know her grandparents .
yeah we ... we can live with that .
the reason why i wanted you to come by
was ... a year before giving birth to lisa
monica had a son .
we &apos;ve already matched his dna to your daughter .
the closest relative should take custody .
would you like to meet him ?
what &apos;s his name ?
michael .
michael .
have a seat .
the bureau thinks that my ability
to lead this team has been compromised .
what do you think ?
sometimes i question you hotch .
but at the end of the day i do respect you .
you &apos;re the leader of this team
and my job is to have your back .
well that &apos;s not important to the bureau .
they &apos;ve been questioning me
since foyet &apos;s attack .
and they &apos;re not entirely wrong .
i &apos;ve tried to do my best
but what matters now is
if strauss replaces me
this whole unit will come under scrutiny .
members will be reassigned budgets will be cut .
come on hotch nobody &apos;s gonna replace you .
fight strauss . i &apos;ll go to the mat for you .
so will everybody else . you know that .
morgan it won &apos;t work .
decisions like this have their own momentum ...
unless i step down .
step down ? what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m resigning as unit chief at the end of the week .
what ?
no !
hotch look yeah ok
sometimes your actions i may disagree with them
but it &apos;s not enough for you to leave this team .
i &apos;m not leaving the team
i &apos;m just no longer in charge .
you are .
me ?
look i had the chance to be unit chief in new york
and i said no .
i turned it down because i like this team .
strauss can &apos;t just fire you like this .
she can reassign me .
and we can avoid that if i promote internally .
this is wrong .
it &apos;s the only way to keep the team together .
so all of this ...
this is why you &apos;ve been pushing me so hard huh ?
i haven &apos;t been pushing you that hard .
morgan i need to know
right now ...
will you do this ?
this would be temporary .
once we catch foyet
all this goes back to normal .
let &apos;s get started .
what &apos;s all this ?
this is the job
unless you have other plans .
