it &apos;s nice to get back to nature .
why don &apos;t i do this more often ?
what a beautiful forest .
hello , little butterfly .
what &apos;s your na ...
whatcha doing ?
i was enjoying some virtual reality ,
until you ruined it with your actual face .
what am i smelling ?
oh , it &apos;s car air freshener .
i was simulating the smell of the forest .
that &apos;s not what the forest smells like .
well , how would i know ?
why are you pretending to be outdoors ?
you hate it .
amy showed me a compelling study
that demonstrated the cognitive benefit
of spending time in the wilderness .
buddy , i am ready to drive you
into the wilderness any time you want
and leave you there .
well , make your jokes , but some of the participants
who spent four days in the woods away from all technology
reported a 50 % gain in reasoning skills upon their return .
okay , if that &apos;s true ,
why aren &apos;t there more genius squirrels ?
you may need this more than i do .
here &apos;s your tea .
do not sneak up on a guy when he &apos;s sitting on a log .
you know , if you really want to be in nature ,
why don &apos;t we rent a cabin ?
look , i &apos;m sorry , when did you even get here ? i ...
you know , there &apos;s a cabin in big bear
that a doctor i work with keeps offering me .
because he &apos;s hitting on you ?
she .
oh , good .
but i could get her .
we could all go for the weekend .
it &apos;ll be fun .
yeah ... excuse me .
here , look up &quot; fun , &quot; get back to me .
you and i could still go and have a nice weekend .
sure .
come on , sheldon , let &apos;s go with them .
i hardly think so .
you be sure and say hello to
all the mosquitoes , bees , bears , snakes ,
possums , poison oak ,
oh , and last , but not least ,
teenagers with guitars .
i &apos;ll see if it &apos;s available .
you know , if that study &apos;s real ,
leonard might come back smarter than you .
are you trying to manipulate me ?
yes .
well done , it worked , we &apos;re going .
yay !
come on , raj ,
give me a bag .
no , no , you &apos;re pregnant .
the only thing you carry
is our hope for a better tomorrow .
hey , where you been ?
uh , raj took me to the baby doctor
and then we swung by the grocery store .
did you get graham crackers ?
i mean , are ... what ... is the baby okay ?
yes and yes .
i didn &apos;t know you needed help running errands today .
i didn &apos;t , but raj volunteered .
really ?
yeah , ever since you told him i was pregnant ,
he &apos;s really been making a fuss over me .
oh . well , i guess that &apos;s kind of sweet .
bernie , i just forwarded you a list
of the top five lactation consultants in los angeles .
i know my favorite ,
but i &apos;d love to hear what you think .
and it just got weird .
hey . amy &apos;s downstairs .
okay , one sec .
uh , what @-@ what you got goin &apos; on here ?
i bought a baseball cap .
i can see that .
what team did you get ?
uh , hufflepuff , from harry potter .
well , we &apos;ll be in the woods .
i &apos;m ready to go .
anything you &apos;d like to say to him ?
nice hat , sheldon .
thanks .
why are you so mean to me ?
what the hell are you watching ?
raj found all these childbirth videos online .
this one is of a woman giving birth in a river .
okay , that is the least jewish thing
i &apos;ve ever seen in my life .
you feel like raj is getting a little carried away
with all the baby stuff ?
i don &apos;t think so .
he just wants to be part of the experience .
all right , if you say so .
what &apos;s in the box ?
oh , it &apos;s an ultrasonic microphone
so we can hear the baby &apos;s heartbeat .
that &apos;s cool .
can we try it ?
actually , raj ordered it .
he made me promise to wait till he was here .
so he can be ...
part of the experience ?
yeah .
i &apos;m surprised he let us conceive without him .
it &apos;s a sore spot-- don &apos;t bring it up .
it &apos;s so cute and rustic up here .
i know .
did you see they still have a video rental place ?
it &apos;s like colonial williamsburg .
well ... cell service is down to one bar ,
so if anyone needs medical attention
or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid ,
now &apos;s the time .
have you ever been off the grid before ?
once .
the battery ran out on my phone .
i had to wait for my ipad to turn on .
i was afraid he was gonna eat me .
raj just pulled up .
i &apos;m gonna say something to him .
leave it alone . he means well .
so you don &apos;t think he needs to rein it in a little ?
no , not really .
and you &apos;re not concerned he &apos;s acting like
somehow this is his kid , too ?
he &apos;s just trying to be supportive .
just supportive .
not over @-@ the @-@ top in any way ?
no .
hello !
2.6米高 含外送费只要280美元
you saw him carrying that .
astronauts saw him carrying that .
this place is great !
so nice of that doctor to just let you use it .
well , she is taking me to an indigo girls concert ,
so hold that thought .
okay .
should we check each other for ticks ?
sheldon , all we did was walk in from the car .
oh . well , suit yourself .
who wants to check me ?
on the other hand , safety first .
wow , it &apos;s really coming down .
this sucks .
and there goes our hike .
oh , not our hike !
now we have to stay safe and warm .
you know , we could still go .
a little rain isn &apos;t gonna kill us .
have you been outside in the rain with sheldon ?
no .
you &apos;ll wish it would kill you .
so what do we do now ?
they have some board games .
eh , most of the jenga pieces are missing
and the scrabble only has seven tiles ,
so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure
with the word &quot; shnerpf &quot; next to it , move on .
hey , let &apos;s light a fire .
ooh , that sounds cozy .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve lit a real fire before .
ah , it &apos;s basic thermodynamics .
i &apos;m sure we can figure that out .
i could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow .
that would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion .
right . so all we need is to ...
got it .
a scientist made that .
look , raj , you &apos;re my best friend in the world
and i really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby .
please , my pleasure .
and , of course , howie and i both want you to be a part of all this .
but we have to set some boundaries .
i don &apos;t understand .
the three of us aren &apos;t having this baby .
just the two of us .
okay . yeah , i get it .
i &apos;ll back off .
thanks for understanding .
of course .
i &apos;ll give you guys some space .
let me just get this out of your way .
you need some help ?
no , i got it .
raj ... raj , wait .
please , bernadette .
let me leave with my dignity .
hey , you guys want to play a drinking game ?
oh , well now , well now , we &apos;ll never win .
you always play the drinking game .
not the drinking game , a drinking game .
to be fair , good at both .
what &apos;s the game ?
all right , it &apos;s called never have i ever .
the rules are simple .
someone says something they &apos;ve never done ,
but if you have done it , you take a drink .
i &apos;ve never played that before .
hey , now , wait .
have we started ? do i drink ?
what is happening ?
okay .
calm down . i &apos;ll go first .
all right , let &apos;s see .
never have i ever ...
she &apos;s trying to think of something she &apos;s never done before .
this could take a while .
very funny .
okay , never have i ever ...
yeah , you know what ?
let &apos;s just circle back .
okay , i &apos;ll go .
never have i ever been arrested .
so i drink .
no , it &apos;s only if you &apos;ve done it .
got it .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve been arrested .
i can &apos;t believe penny hasn &apos;t .
sheldon , what did you do ?
well , i &apos;m not proud of it ,
but ...
i jaywalked .
oh , no , it &apos;s like a horror movie .
we &apos;re trapped in a cabin with a maniac .
i &apos;m surprised you would do that .
no , i crossed in the middle of the street .
and normally , i wouldn &apos;t ,
but i saw an aggressive @-@ looking girl scout ,
and it was the heart of cookie season .
anyway , there was a police officer ,
and he witnessed the whole thing .
what-- he arrested you for that ?
no , he didn &apos;t do anything .
so i said , &quot; you just saw me jaywalk .
why aren &apos;t you doing your job ? &quot; you know ?
&quot; m @-@ maybe i should arrest you
for @-@ for impersonating a police officer . &quot;
and then you got arrested .
oh , and how .
i feel like i just made a horrible mistake .
yeah .
but on the other hand ,
i didn &apos;t kick him out of our lives .
i just asked him to back off a little .
yeah .
what ? are you gonna cry ?
yeah !
is it baby hormones or actually sad ?
i can &apos;t tell anymore !
i &apos;ll go get him .
and bring back the bear !
this game &apos;s dangerous .
i could get you in trouble .
how ?
well , never have i ever
used sheldon &apos;s toothbrush to clean the sink .
fine , is that how you want to play this ?
all right , never have i ever come up
with a nickname for my own genitals .
never should &apos;ve told you about alvin and the chipmunks .
okay . my turn .
never have i ever
completely rocked my girlfriend &apos;s world in bed .
amy ...
you know the rules .
drink .
yeah , go ahead .
that &apos;s right .
all right , my turn .
oh , i know .
never have i ever kept a secret bank account ,
because i think my wife can &apos;t handle money .
did i win ?
i feel like i won .
i can &apos;t believe this .
you realize i make more money than you ?
i don &apos;t , i know , but this isn &apos;t a big deal .
it &apos;s just a little savings i put aside .
we &apos;re married .
we &apos;re supposed to share everything .
what-- you mean , like , your massive credit card debt ?
i &apos;m calling it .
i won .
i appreciate the apology ,
but it &apos;s really not necessary .
i overstepped my bounds .
no , raj , you &apos;ve been great .
i just , i need to start doing my part around here .
i hear that .
well , if that &apos;s the case ,
is there anything i can do to help ?
well , not right now .
but we could try out that microphone you got us ,
and listen to the baby &apos;s heartbeat .
really ?
it &apos;s okay if i listen with you ? !
of course .
can i squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach ?
hey , look at that .
it &apos;s weird again .
okay , you have every right to be mad .
and what you said is true .
you do make more money than me .
so i had no right to do what i did .
and i &apos;m so sorry .
i hope you can forgive me .
how long have you had this secret account ?
a couple years , but i just put a few bucks aside
every month for emergencies .
well , how much you got in there ?
$ 6,427 .
$ 47 once my nana &apos;s birthday check gets here .
my god , leonard , do you know
what i could do with that kind of money ?
no , i do , and that &apos;s why i hid it .
what good is it if you don &apos;t use it ?
uh , uh , you have shoes you love , but never wear .
i have money i love ,
but never spend .
we &apos;re kind of a cute couple that way .
again , i &apos;m sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have kept it a secret .
well , i have a secret i &apos;ve been keeping from you , too .
is it a secret bank account ?
because that would be awesome .
i hate my job .
really ?
why ?
because i don &apos;t feel good flirting with doctors for sales .
i mean , i know i make a lot of money .
but i haven &apos;t been happy for a while .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i know how important it is to you
that i &apos;m having some success .
that &apos;s not true .
okay , really ? so you &apos;d be fine if i went
back to acting and waiting tables again ?
if that &apos;s what you want to do , yes .
well , it &apos;s not what i want to do .
oh , yes .
doesn &apos;t matter what i want .
look , this job is gonna get me out of debt .
so i &apos;m gonna do the grown @-@ up thing and see it through .
well , that is the grown @-@ up thing .
i guess .
i love you .
i love you , too .
you know ,
never have i ever made love
in the forest while it was raining .
well , guess i gotta drink .
all right , here we go .
i &apos;m not hearing anything .
well , give me a second .
are you sure you can do this ?
hey , who found four dollars and change
on the beach with his metal detector ?
i buried it there , so we could go home .
wait , that &apos;s it .
isn &apos;t that the best ?
you guys made a person .
we did .
and i like to think i helped .
you didn &apos;t .
oh , um , never have i ever
drunk milk past its expiration date .
never have i ever
cancelled a dentist appointment .
oh , uh , never have i ever
put my foot in the ocean .
never have i ever
honked if i liked anything .
uh ... never have i ever
thrown , caught or touched a frisbee .
never have i ever
put salt on my food
without trying it first .
never have i ever
pushed all the buttons in an elevator .
well , we all have a past .
