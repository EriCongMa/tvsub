something for the committee to put on their radar : insurance .
what about it ?
school needs some .
i can ask around on the street .
what the hell ?
too cool for street insurance ? must be nice .
my sister wants to know what i &apos;m bringing
to my grandson &apos;s birthday party .
i &apos;m sensing an emergency collage situation .
no , i wasn &apos;t invited .
my son had a kid three years ago .
i barely get to see him on major holidays .
i mean , who in the hell does he think he is ?
you saw your son at his wedding .
no , that &apos;s furio . that &apos;s my gay son .
him i get . hank &apos;s a knob .
he doesn &apos;t have any hobbies or interests .
all he does is play that , what do you call that crap .
with the dungeons and the dragons ?
dungeons &amp; dragons ?
that &apos;s the crap .
i know that game .
we play dungeons &amp; dragons .
guys , let &apos;s play d &amp; d to help hickey reconnect with his son !
was everyone &apos;s takeaway from last time
that we can use d &amp; d to reprogram brains ?
nobody feels that we almost caused a suicide ?
we prevented one .
fa ... bulous neil felt like a nobody ,
and thanks to us , he &apos;s still out there ,
doing this and that in the background .
a satisfying sequel is difficult to pull off .
many geniuses have defeated themselves through hubris ,
making this a chance to prove
that i &apos;m better than all of them . i &apos;m in .
all in favor of a game of dungeons &amp; dragons
to reunite hickey and his son tomorrow night ?
aye !
well , okay .
it &apos;s short notice , but , uh ,
i think it &apos;ll be good for me .
so , dad , i &apos;m just curious .
um , what is it about dungeons &amp; dragons
that suddenly leapt out at you at age 60 ?
um ... dungeons . it &apos;d be the dungeons .
let &apos;s begin .
a blood @-@ orange sunrise crests the peaks of rage mountain ,
as the eight of you arrive at the troubled realm of galindor .
ahead to the north , a bridged ravine .
beyond that , a mysterious black tower
where , rumor has it , an evil necromancer dwells .
your goal :
reach to the top of the tower and destroy the necromancer ,
freeing the realm from his evil magic .
oh , that &apos;s just what i love about role @-@ playing games ,
is being told exactly what to do .
me too .
you should introduce yourselves .
i am ...
oh , boy . joseph gordon diehard .
really .
son of sir riggs diehard .
well , i &apos;m sir riggs diehard ,
so i guess i &apos;m your dad in the game too .
oh , my god , so cool .
oh , it &apos;s nice .
isn &apos;t that weird ?
oh , boy .
guys , i don &apos;t suppose that this is some sort
of contrived paint @-@ by @-@ numbers adventure
that &apos;s designed to force an emotional bond
between me and my emotionally stunted father , is it ?
no way , jose .
we wouldn &apos;t do that to you .
man .
what ?
i got an idea .
why don &apos;t we just sort of reshuffle these ...
and just redistribute them ...
no , i don &apos;t ... - and just mix &apos; em up a bit .
is this right , abed ? should we ...
and here we go .
hello , everyone .
i am tristram steelheart .
i &apos;m a holy cleric with a mace
and a dumb name .
i &apos;m tiny nuggins , a , uh , a thief ,
and the rest is gibberish .
greetings , i am fibrosis the ranger .
i &apos;m crouton , the half @-@ orc druid .
druid ? oh , crouton .
hector the well @-@ endowed ? again ?
you think that &apos;s a weird coincidence ?
i &apos;m a troll named dingleberry .
that &apos;s my mom &apos;s nickname for me .
well , i &apos;m who hickey was , sir riggs diehard .
i am joseph gordon ,
son of riggs .
i protect the blade of diehard ,
a family sword whose power knows no equal .
in our clan , the leader carries the hilt ,
his eldest heir , the blade ,
for we believe man &apos;s greatest weapon against evil
is the bond bet ...
is the bond between a father and son .
what would you guys like to do ?
we should cross the bridge
and head for the black tower .
huzzah ? huzzah ?
huzzah .
yeah , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m gonna head across the bridge , actually .
i mean , what else is out there ?
what &apos;s south or east or west ?
how about it , aziz ?
if i walk too far south ,
do i fall off your graph paper there ?
you can head south .
i &apos;ve generated some details about the surrounding area .
you know , for god &apos;s sakes , hank ,
it &apos;s been five seconds .
can you not do this ?
hey , you tell me .
are we losing ?
no .
it &apos;s not a competition .
the only winner is fun .
we &apos;re having fun !
i go to tristram , and i &apos;m laughing ,
and i pick him up ,
and i carry him to the bridge . it &apos;s fun !
hector the well endowed is trying to lift you .
i cast torvin &apos;s flesh of fire .
tristram murmurs an incantation .
his body becomes wreathed in white @-@ hot flame ,
burning hector for ...
six damage .
hey !
well , hector , that &apos;s called self @-@ defense .
tristram &apos;s flesh of fire spell has caught the bridge on fire .
the rope supports in the middle snap ,
causing the bridge to twist .
i &apos;m rolling dexterity checks to see if you all hold on .
abed , considering the bigger picture ,
you think it might be possible you miscalculated
the strength of the bridge , hmm ?
good point . it would &apos;ve been constructed
in the third age by goblins ,
and they used primitive iron anchors .
the ropes are yanked from the rocky slopes
on both sides , and you all plummet into the ravine below .
abed !
abed !
you plunge into the icy , raging waters of skull river .
you know , what &apos;s your problem ?
what &apos;s your problem ?
you didn &apos;t invite me
to sebastian &apos;s birthday .
ah , ha , ha , i knew it !
who hoards a man &apos;s grandson ?
he &apos;s not your grandson . he &apos;s my son .
and i didn &apos;t invite you to the birthday party
&apos;cause i wanted to enjoy it .
you know , fathers and sons ,
there is a lot of power between them .
yeah ...
stop it .
and i spent a long time
letting that power push me away from my dad , and i regret it .
so what &apos;s ever between you guys
will only get fixed when you &apos;re together .
they &apos;re not together .
abed , you &apos;re not helping .
i &apos;d be a pretty bad dungeon master if i was .
jeff , hickey , annie , and shirley ,
you &apos;ve been washed down the left fork of the skull river ,
the others to the right .
father !
if you &apos;re going to continue , i need hank ,
britta , chang , and dean pelton to go into a different room .
yeah , we &apos;re not going to continue .
thank you very much , guys .
this was just awesome .
yeah , wait , wait , wait .
i &apos;ll play your dragon game with you .
but let &apos;s make it interesting .
if i kill the necrophile before you do ,
i come to my grandson &apos;s birthday .
we &apos;ll settle it like men .
or whatever you call the guys that play this .
okay .
but if i kill the necromancer before you do ,
then you don &apos;t go to christmas or thanksgiving
at aunt rachel &apos;s .
you don &apos;t even go to that .
yeah , but i will if you don &apos;t .
okay , fine .
okay .
let the real game begin .
i will find you !
well , i &apos;m assuming you guys can help me beat him ,
because if we lose , i &apos;m gonna punch each of you in the heart .
you awaken on a muddy riverbank ,
surrounded by treacherous , god @-@ forsaken ,
non @-@ zipline vacation jungle .
i build a fire
and construct a crude wooden rack
to dry my boots and oversized codpiece .
all right , and i can make some s &apos;mores
out of horse meat and s &apos;more horse meat .
build a fire ? horse s &apos;mores ? screw this .
the river runs east . i head west .
tiny nuggins scampers into the jungle .
hey , pal , i didn &apos;t scamper in the jungles of nicaragua ,
and i &apos;m not gonna do it now .
wait , come back ! i follow him .
me too .
tiny nuggins ,
if we rest , we &apos;ll regain our strength .
and lose my family .
i &apos;ll imaginary sleep when i &apos;m imaginary dead .
through the brush in the distance ,
you notice a patrol of half a dozen hobgoblins .
hobgoblins ?
larger , stronger , and worth more
in scrabble than regular goblins .
everybody , get down .
i punch him in the heart .
what ?
well , i punch him in the heart , and i keep running .
there are no women with them , are there ?
i got class .
you charge toward them , alerting them to your presence ,
and you attack the nearest one in the chest .
you miss and fall down .
what ?
the hobgoblins are heading toward nuggins with spears .
oh , no !
uh , i cast entangle on them .
crouton the druid waves her arms ,
causing grass , vines , and branches to entangle the limbs of ...
four hobgoblins .
the two free hobgoblins fire arrows at crouton .
one pierces her shoulder ...
the other her chest .
i fire an arrow at them .
hit .
ah , these hobgoblins don &apos;t like their odds .
they bolt into the jungle .
yeah , you better run .
go find a name that &apos;s not just
another creature &apos;s name plus &quot; hob . &quot;
crouton ?
i &apos;m here .
she was badly wounded from her fall in the skull river ,
and the arrows were just too much .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s it ? is she dead ?
yes , that &apos;s it , hickey .
i &apos;m dead . but it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m on your side .
which is why i &apos;m dead .
and i may be gone , but just remember
whenever the wind whispers through the woods ,
you got me killed .
now , you listen to me , young man .
i &apos;ve punched about a thousand hearts in my life .
i never , never missed .
have you ever been a 3 @-@ foot @-@ tall halfling
running through 2 @-@ foot @-@ high vines ,
trying to punch a 7 @-@ foot monster ?
i &apos;m gonna go check on the others .
you might want to check your character .
or just kind of generally take this game seriously .
your son does .
i take a moment of silence
to mourn my fallen comrade , crouton ...
before rifling through her belongings .
what news of my father ?
you have no way of knowing where the others are .
damn it .
you &apos;re still traveling north
along the narrow cliff edges of the hawthorne mountains .
okay , i &apos;ll roll for any encounters .
i &apos;d like to cast a healing spell on fibrosis .
thank you .
but i &apos;m not gonna help you kick your dad out of your life .
i don &apos;t think this competition is healthy ,
and i don &apos;t think what you did back there was cool .
look , you think i &apos;m the bad guy
because i didn &apos;t invite him to my son &apos;s birthday .
but you know where he was for most of my birthdays ?
little place that rhymes with &quot; not there . &quot;
times square ?
the four of you hear an ominous screeching .
moving upward into view ,
three huge , white arachnids with eagle wings .
sky spiders .
i draw my sword ...
and i cry out , &quot; back , eight @-@ legged demons !
&quot; i will not scoop you up with a catalogue
and let you outside on this day ! &quot;
stay your blade , joseph gordon .
sky spiders are as frightened of us as we are of them .
plus they eat all the sky mosquitoes .
i cast speak with monsters ,
and i say , &quot; hello .
you &apos;re looking well . &quot;
the lead spider bends four knees
and twitches its hairy ovipositor ,
rhythmically secreting and retracting
a giant droplet ... or drop ... of silk .
oh .
fibrosis , as a ranger ,
you recognize this as the arachnid &apos;s signal
of submission .
oh . nice work , tristram .
damn , you made that sky spider your bitch , yo !
you &apos;ve tracked the hobgoblins to this shack .
one guard hob @-@ guards the door .
that &apos;s what they call guarding .
go .
sniper arrow on the guard .
it strikes true . the guard drops .
i move to the doorway . detect traps .
none detected .
i enter .
left flank .
right !
one hobgoblin , facing east .
backstab .
double damage .
critical hit . he &apos;s dead .
footsteps behind the door to the north .
i notch two arrows .
i climb the walls to get above the door .
five goblins enter from the north .
i fire .
both arrows hit .
cleave !
you kill one
and wound another .
i drop on the last one and grapple .
you got ahold of him .
this one is for crouton .
with his dying breath , he utters ...
&quot; the dark lord will kill you all . &quot;
wait , these things can talk ?
i want two taken alive . i want to try something .
hi .
i &apos;m tiny nuggins .
i &apos;m gonna put my dagger down right here ,
so we can just talk .
human trash .
yeah , look , i &apos;m gonna give it to you straight .
we &apos;re looking for a necromancer .
we don &apos;t need two goblins to find him .
so between you and your friend , who do you think &apos;s the most useful ?
man , your friend sure can talk .
liar . he &apos;ll never turn .
oh , yeah ,
because of that famous goblin loyalty .
i could never drive a wedge between you
and some guy from work .
uh , i was best man at that guy &apos;s wedding .
your friend says you just got married .
congratulations . too bad about the food .
i hope your flesh rots in ...
wait . what about the food ?
oh , i guess he didn &apos;t like your wedding toast .
golbak said that ?
klang doesn &apos;t approve of you and lisa , golbak ,
and i don &apos;t get the sense
it &apos;s because of his feelings for you .
you know , i think about lisa ,
sitting in that hole in darktooth canyon
with little framrok and griknog
rolling about on the wolf pelts .
come on , between you and me ,
which one do you think is yours ?
no !
i know where the tower is .
the sky spiders have flown you
as far as their complex religion allows .
they set you down and express through intricate prancing
directions to the tower .
yes .
father , forgive me .
i have traveled so far from you .
how many game days since the skull river ripped us apart ?
how many real hours since i &apos;ve gone pee ?
we seek this necromancer . why ?
why ?
our reasons are dreams , our dreams , dust .
i send word on wings of sparrows ,
in hopes they might find you .
abed says the odds are near impossible .
that &apos;s enough for me .
should you receive this message ,
i know of a way to reunite .
according to my character sheet ,
if i rub the blade of our magic family sword
while you rub the hilt ,
twin beacons of light will reveal our locations to each other .
each night , i will think of you and rub ,
praying for the night fate
will find us rubbing together .
your son , joseph gordon diehard .
something strange has happened .
a sparrow lands on riggs diehard &apos;s shoulder .
it carries a note .
abed , i ... rub my sword &apos;s hilt ?
a beam of light shoots out from your location ,
as the hilt of diehard seeks its blade .
the beam arcs and meets an equal beam
in the woods to the north .
is that where the others are ?
yes , 10 miles away , same as you .
so we &apos;ll be arriving at the tower ...
at the same time tomorrow morning .
this began as a race .
but it may end in war .
does anybody have a toothpick ?
i got a piece of popcorn stuck in my tooth .
you know , it &apos;s , like , right under the gum ,
and , you know , i &apos;ve been trying , like , for 15 minutes
with , you know , my tooth and , like , with my tongue
and with my finger , and i &apos;m always one tooth off ,
and i just can &apos;t seem to ...
oh , hello , there we go . anyway .
but it may end in war .
maybe after all we &apos;ve been through ,
we should just call this thing off .
what , you think that &apos;s up to us ?
you &apos;ve seen the way he talks to me .
he doesn &apos;t want his own father in his life .
he &apos;ll do anything to win , and that includes attacking you .
and you best believe that your little friends
in there are drinking up his kool @-@ aid .
this is a man who thinks of grandchildren like trophies .
which is why he &apos;ll play to win .
and why i can &apos;t let him .
rise , brave , sweet dingleberry .
rise .
both parties have arrived at the black tower .
hi , guys .
father .
joseph gordon .
we are here , so tristram steelheart ,
lord of the sky spiders , can slay the necromancer .
you guys cool , or are we gonna have to get red ?
tiny nuggins , waterboarder of goblins ,
will do the slaying , because every man has
the right to hang out with his grandson .
too bad you &apos;re outnumbered .
no , they &apos;re not .
i &apos;m not part of this .
i &apos;m joseph gordon diehard , and i am only here
to hug my father , which i now do .
it &apos;s a trick .
i &apos;m not letting him hug me .
i hug my father .
he has gunpowder in his pants .
i draw my sword . stay back !
i draw an arrow .
so do i.
troll sound !
jeff , do you lower your sword ?
no !
dean , are you ...
i hug my father !
you &apos;re impaled .
worth it .
good lord .
son slayer !
i attack jeff !
arrow at chang !
arrow at annie !
i head for the door .
so do i !
taste the blade of diehard !
i run for cover .
i turn a snake into a rope .
fire two arrows at annie .
spear , spear .
i take the kid . i pop him .
three damage .
lightning bolt , lightning bolt , lightning bolt .
cure moderate wounds !
i spray all over them .
i hold britta &apos;s face in a puddle .
seven damage .
cleave , cleave , cleave !
i fire two arrows .
dingleberry smash !
plus three , demonic eye look .
and shove it up them !
after that , i put one right behind the ear .
sir riggs , hand in your character sheet .
top floor of the tower , one door .
i open it .
i cast flame strike on him .
you cast that already .
mace .
okay . missed .
ah .
i hit him with a throwing dagger .
you used all your knives .
ah , what ...
will one of you guys take care ...
what ? you &apos;re all dead ? i keep going .
i follow .
you &apos;ve reached the necromancer &apos;s workshop .
you see his bed , some bottles of goop ,
some other necromancing crap ,
but no necromancer .
i search . i search .
can i search , or are you gonna stab me in the back ?
hey , i am a thief , not a wuss .
i search too .
you find a secret door .
it &apos;s easy because it &apos;s already open .
it leads to a ladder , which goes straight down
to another open door on the back of the tower .
ah , man .
way to go . that &apos;s great .
he just got away .
hey , you can &apos;t just say he &apos;s gone .
you owe us an ending .
i owe you nothing .
i am a dungeon master .
i create a boundless world ,
and i bind it by rules .
too heavy for a bridge ? it breaks .
get hit ? take damage .
spend an hour outside someone &apos;s front door ,
fighting over who gets to kill him ?
he leaves through the back .
he &apos;s out there somewhere .
you might find him , if you get your crap together .
hey , guys .
take it from a bunch of ghosts .
this is no kind of life .
you need fresh air and frozen yogurt .
it &apos;s on me .
hug it out .
oh , see ...
hug it out ?
gag me .
who even uses that phrase ?
are you out of your mind ?
all right ,
i &apos;m climbing down the ladder . i &apos;m gonna find this guy .
i stay and search the workshop .
does he have any stuff there that can heal me ?
you do find some potions .
okay , well , i @-@ i get half of that .
excuse me , you just went down the ladder .
well , i can hear you ... can i hear him looting upstairs ?
not if i move about silently .
fine . fine . if i heal you ,
can we divide the potions ?
okay . but i decide who gets what .
all right , fine , but we &apos;ve gotta be wary of traps .
i don &apos;t have to do a damn thing that you tell me to do .
what &apos;s going on ?
shh .
you outta your mind ? oh , you give me a break .
do you wanna get the necromancer or not ?
i &apos;m so up to here with you .
do you want ...
do they like each other now ?
are you kidding me ?
they can &apos;t stand being in the same room .
i also don &apos;t think they can handle being apart .
and i think they just found a way
to avoid doing either .
and that &apos;s the best most fathers and sons can do .
you &apos;ve made me so proud today .
does anyone know where we can buy a real sword ?
jeffrey .
you &apos;re still at the entrance to the chamber of grief .
your move , mr. tickles .
you successfully pour more tea into count frogula &apos;s cup .
that puts it at hillary rodham kitten .
okay , you attempt to pass crumpets .
you fail .
okay , guys , i &apos;m getting a little frustrated .
if you &apos;d just take a look at your inventories ,
you &apos;ll see that ...
abed , are you almost done ?
i can &apos;t sleep without my stuffies .
fine . hold on .
oh , a goblin notices you and murders you all .
you &apos;re dead . they &apos;re all yours .
