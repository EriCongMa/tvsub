gatekeeper
oh , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna be late for work .
the sun &apos;s not even up .
it is in london .
your job sucks .
well , it pays the bills .
yeah , well , not mine .
turn out the light .
don &apos;t i get a kiss first ?
no .
please ?
one .
one is not enough .
call me .
we &apos;ll talk .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ll call .
i know you won &apos;t call .
you &apos;ll text .
say , &apos; sup ? expect me to come over
and have sex with you and go back home .
is it the entire male species that you have a low opinion of
or is it just me ?
just you .
i will call you tonight .
i promise .
and i &apos;ll come back to you again .
good .
have fun at work .
dude ...
kara , listen .
i think i &apos;m in love .
scotty just left my place .
her name is ashley .
the guy at the bar .
no , wait , it &apos;s not like that .
there was a real connection .
what do you think ? he just left .
i &apos;m telling you , man , she &apos;s a game @-@ changer .
no , i know , but it wasn &apos;t like that .
she has a thing for bunnies .
it was ... real .
and when i say a thing ,
i mean she &apos;s seriously obsessed .
no , i will not tell you his shoe size .
* you must remember this *
* a kiss is still a kiss *
* a sigh is just a sigh *
* the fundamental things apply *
right over there .
that &apos;s where i saw carolyn the first time .
no offense , rossi ,
but this place is kind of a dump .
oh , back then it wasn &apos;t .
back then the biggest names would come here .
creedence , the eagles , chicago .
it was a marine bar .
they played for us jarheads .
what was carolyn doing here ?
waiting for ringo .
beatlemania was no joke .
i mean , it would make the women crazy .
she &apos;d write them a letter once a week ,
begging the band to come visit .
did they ever come ?
ringo did , after his divorce .
but luckily , carolyn met me first .
but that &apos;s how we all became friends .
devil honey for dave .
and an arnold palmer for the kid .
oh , on second thought , helen--
it &apos;s garcia .
so much for a night off .
you better bring us the bill .
ok . that &apos;ll be 10 bucks .
no , you can charge us for the drinks we didn &apos;t have .
everything &apos;s marked down until it &apos;s all gone .
oh , you can &apos;t close .
this place is history .
unfortunately , dave , history doesn &apos;t pay the bills .
marines used to be big business .
still are . that &apos;s why 3 new bars opened up across the street .
what &apos;s that thing they say about competition ?
it breeds success ?
it sucks .
well ... keep the change .
thank you , dave .
i hate to see this place go .
beantown has turned into chokeville .
3 victims , all male , wallets stolen .
the unsub uses a garrote to strangle his victims .
he strikes at night and there have been no witnesses .
how much did he get ?
well , it &apos;s odd . each of the victims , socio @-@ economically ,
is lower to middle class .
it &apos;s doubtful there would have been much cash ,
and there have been no charge attempts
on any of the credit cards .
so the murders might not be about money at all .
taking the wallets could be a forensic countermeasure
to delay victim identification .
that could be the sitch with the first two victims ,
but the latest one , scott delfino ,
he was on the phone with his roommate when he was attacked .
call cut out unexpectedly ,
repeated callbacks went straight to voicemail .
and delfino &apos;s body was found an hour later .
indications were they &apos;d been blitzed .
which speaks to the killer &apos;s prep work but also his desperation .
he chose a location to lay in wait .
but wasn &apos;t capable of adapting to a target on the phone .
that could be arrogance getting in the way .
and making his organization appear mixed .
to me that screams false confidence .
which means that desperation is what &apos;s driving him .
it &apos;s not about the kills , it &apos;s about what the murders represent .
he &apos;s mission oriented .
he doesn &apos;t want to kill them , he has to .
which suggests the unsub
has no personal connection to his victims .
except choking as a kill method is extremely personal .
he feels each victim take their last breath .
what if the wallets are a form of depersonalization ?
he &apos;s stripping his victims of their identities .
which means he may feel stripped of his own .
if the wallets are trophies ,
he could be seeking recognition for his work .
and he may not stop killing until he gets that recognition .
let &apos;s go .
&quot; if passion drives you ,
let reason hold the reins . &quot;
benjamin franklin .
ryan maxford worked as a counselor at a local boys &apos; home .
and scott delfino worked for dynamo industries ,
which is an international pharmaceutical firm .
besides gender , the victimology varies .
he doesn &apos;t care about age or race .
he blends in and is most likely unassuming .
yet has no problem
taking down a 6 &apos; 5 , &quot; 260 @-@ pound man .
maxford was a former football all @-@ american .
which probably rules out
my unsub as a woman who hates men theory .
it &apos;d be hard to gain leverage on these guys .
true , but hatred of men might not be far off .
the victims could be surrogates .
for someone else or the unsub himself ?
it &apos;s too early to tell .
if the unsub does feel stripped of his own identity ,
he could be trying to make these men appear the same way .
he could be recognizing in his victims a behavioral trait
consistent with the object of his rage that triggers him to kill .
we need to determine where he &apos;s finding his victims .
geographically speaking ,
none of the victims live near one another ,
but they were all killed downtown ,
which is where the unsub likes to operate .
that fits with where maxford works ,
but not with the other two victims .
his area of control , while relatively small ,
includes a number of residential and commercial buildings .
factoring in a 3 @-@ mile radius in a city with a population
of 636,479 over 48.28 miles ,
we &apos;re looking at approximately
39,549.23 people living in his comfort zone .
how many of them male ?
18,944.08 .
garcia , start with the victim &apos;s known associates .
we need a list of everyone who lives and works downtown .
on it . i &apos;m a genius , too .
morgan , blake , and i will go to the field office
and start with garcia &apos;s list .
dave , go to the m.e.
and see what they can offer us .
jj , you and reid
go to the scene where scott delfino &apos;s body was found .
his roommate &apos;s waiting to talk to you there .
is that a good idea ,
talking to him where his friend was murdered ?
well , apparently he &apos;s insisting on it .
boston p.d. says he won &apos;t leave the scene until you do .
ben harrison ?
you the fbi ?
i &apos;m agent jennifer jareau .
this is dr. spencer reid .
you know , we didn &apos;t have to do this here .
we could have talked back at our field office .
i wanted to see where it happened .
i was talking to him one second and then the ...
that &apos;s it . gone .
right here scotty &apos;s story ends .
scotty must have been coming from the east ,
otherwise the unsub &apos;s position would have left him exposed .
but ?
that avenue offers 3 different directions to head in lieu of this alleyway ,
so how did the unsub know
scotty was gonna choose this particular one ?
you told the police he met a girl last night .
so walking home this way
wouldn &apos;t be part of his regular routine , right ?
no .
when planning a blitz attack
with varying avenues of approach ,
what do you do ?
eliminate the variable .
strike as close as you can to the point of origin or destination .
but scotty was still miles away from home .
the woman he met lives nearby .
do you have any idea who she was ?
only that her name is ashley and she likes bunnies .
don &apos;t ask . it &apos;s the last thing he said to me .
do you know where they met ?
i &apos;m not sure .
we were watching the pats &apos; game at the purple shamrock ,
and then i had to bail .
i have to pick up my girlfriend from logan , so ...
do you think scotty stayed there ,
or would he have ventured elsewhere after you left ?
i don &apos;t know . there &apos;s so many bars in the area .
scotty had a tendency to ...
wander .
with women , you mean ?
let &apos;s just say it wasn &apos;t often that he slept alone .
did that rub anyone the wrong way ?
not anyone that knew him .
he was too good a guy not to like .
what &apos;d you find out ?
we just talked to jj .
scott delfino &apos;s roommate said something interesting .
apparently delfino was a womanizer
but was too good of a guy not to like .
we heard something similar from ryan maxford &apos;s family .
stand @-@ up guy , but he was always broke
and asking for money .
they would give it to him
because despite his flaws , everybody loved him .
well , that fits mike dunsmore , too .
he spent a quarter of his income on marijuana ,
but he volunteered 5 mornings a week at a soup kitchen .
it &apos;s a stretch ,
but could this be our link ?
is the unsub targeting men
based on their supposed character flaws ?
he &apos;d have to have stalked them well in advance .
why stalk someone you don &apos;t have a personal connection to ?
because he &apos;s not targeting a specific person .
he &apos;s targeting a specific type .
men he thinks are too good to be true .
that was not lame .
now , listen .
i landed the trick .
i &apos;ve seen you ...
it was sloppy , though .
oh , well , it &apos;s better than your tricks .
wait up . hey , stop .
yeah , here , you pick up your board .
dude , put the cigarettes away .
why ?
my mom talked to mrs. herron yesterday .
she found out about the test ?
yeah , and the 3 before that .
so now i &apos;m grounded until the end of the semester .
that &apos;s like 6 weeks .
you don &apos;t think i know that ?
she even took my psp .
no games for a month and a half .
so unless you want your mom to do the same exact thing ,
i &apos;d pocket those cigarettes .
you know what the problem is ?
danny terrido .
you can &apos;t miss the fight tonight .
without you , he &apos;ll kick all of our asses .
there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
my psp is locked up .
take mine . don &apos;t let your mom see it .
we gotta play .
what about you ?
parents at my brother &apos;s game tonight .
i &apos;ll steal his .
that lady is so hot .
right . one of these days
i &apos;m gonna have the nerve to talk to her .
all right , man , i &apos;m out .
all right , sweet . text me when you get home .
definitely .
see you .
you know how many ashleys there are in downtown boston ?
too many ashleys-- that &apos;s how many ashleys .
and the only thing i have to track her down
is she has a penchant for bunnies ?
so , i &apos;m pulling receipts from local pet shops .
nothing crosses . and anyway , even if she likes bunnies ,
it doesn &apos;t mean she owns bunnies .
i like unicorns . i don &apos;t have any unicorns .
i feel like i &apos;m on a trail led by wild geese and bunnies .
what about scott &apos;s cell phone ?
he probably put ashley &apos;s number in it before he died .
yeah , that phone broke during the struggle .
i searched his cloud server ,
but his contacts hadn &apos;t updated yet .
we need to find her , penelope .
ashley might be able to identify the unsub ,
which means she could be at risk , too .
i know . i--you know what ?
send me that broken cell phone .
i may be able to pull data from the device itself .
and in the meantime , forward delfino &apos;s calls to us .
if she tries him , we &apos;ll be able to talk to her .
smart thinking , sensei . routing it now .
delfino put up a struggle , but there was nothing he could do .
killer had all the leverage .
can you tell what kind of garrote was used ?
it varies .
first was fishing line , then picture wire .
now some kind of cable .
all common household items .
i &apos;d say he &apos;s definitely making the weapons himself .
from the looks of it , learning quickly .
each wire was stronger than the last .
there &apos;s something else .
he &apos;s cut a lock of hair off every victim .
something tells me that &apos;s more than an act of depersonalization .
he wants to remember these men
and what he did to them .
anything yet ?
nothing .
typical asshat .
he &apos;s not , though .
how many times has a guy said he &apos;d call and didn &apos;t ?
too many .
he wasn &apos;t like that .
you weren &apos;t there .
call him .
i can &apos;t .
you don &apos;t have his number .
that &apos;s how sure i was he would call .
rookie mistake .
we &apos;re out of wine .
told you we should &apos;ve got another bottle .
we can always get more .
not this late . there &apos;s a killer on the street .
oh , yeah , i saw something about that posted on campus .
just keep your focus .
look out , one &apos;s coming .
all right , uh--
there &apos;s one in the rafters .
oh , crap , i missed .
flank left . flank left !
i &apos;m trying , but terrido &apos;s on my ass .
i got him in my sights .
so shoot him already or i &apos;m toast .
hold on one sec .
and now i &apos;m dead .
but so is terrido . and we win .
good for us . i &apos;m still dead .
the needs of many , my friend .
so i &apos;m collateral damage .
no , you can &apos;t think of it that way , jake .
you &apos;re on the sox and you just hit a sacrifice fly .
yeah , i &apos;ll show you who the sacrifice is gonna be .
uh @-@ oh . looks like your brother is about to bust you on his psp .
nah , he won &apos;t be back for another hour .
we can play one more round .
then who &apos;s there with you ?
no one . why ? can you sneak out ?
jake , there &apos;s someone behind you .
what are you--
colin !
jake ?
mom ! help ! help !
mom ! jake &apos;s in trouble ! hurry !
a friend called it in . he lives down the street .
what kind of mission involves killing a teenage boy ?
normally i would say this points to a devolution
in the unsub &apos;s psyche .
he killed jake in his own home .
it &apos;s the first time he &apos;s been inside . why ?
we &apos;ve been canvassing the area pretty heavily .
maybe he &apos;s adapting to increased police activity .
he &apos;s a low @-@ risk victim killed in his home .
it feels like the unsub knew he would be alone .
so he &apos;s not just stalking jake , but his family , too .
as well as all his other victims .
he can &apos;t be everywhere at once .
maybe he &apos;s been planning this longer than we thought .
the time between kills is getting shorter .
but there &apos;s no indication that he &apos;s deriving
increased pleasure from them .
well , it would make sense if he &apos;s feeling pressure
from an outside agency .
maybe he &apos;s got a deadline .
you &apos;re sure you didn &apos;t catch a glimpse of him ?
just movement in the background .
i tried to warn jake , but ...
did jake see who was there ? did he say anything to you ?
he saw him .
i mean , the guy was right there .
and jake was so scared .
i can &apos;t get his face out of my head .
it &apos;s ok .
i just have one more question .
do you think you can handle that ?
yeah .
ok .
did jake seem like he recognized
the man in his house ?
what are you--
colin !
yeah .
yeah , he knew him .
and i could see it on his face .
but he didn &apos;t say who it was .
just because you recognize
someone doesn &apos;t necessarily mean you know them .
the man could simply be someone that jake
routinely passes on the street .
whoever he is , we &apos;re gonna get him .
ok ?
ok .
agent jareau ?
have you ever been shot ?
why do you ask ?
i just can &apos;t stop thinking about how it felt .
did it hurt a lot when jake died ?
you don &apos;t need to worry about that .
jake wasn &apos;t shot .
then what was the flash ?
what are you--
the unsub we &apos;re looking for is a dangerous voyeur
who feeds off the thrill of knowing his victims can &apos;t see him .
typically voyeurs are nonviolent
and content to remain bystanders .
this one is different .
he &apos;s on a mission that includes taking action .
and in that mission he didn &apos;t hesitate to kill a teenage boy .
anyone who stands between him and his goal is at risk .
we believe he &apos;s documenting his work .
he &apos;s taking pictures
and collects personal connections to his victims--
their wallets and their hair .
it &apos;s important to him to have proof of what he &apos;s doing .
voyeurs like to create fantasies in their heads
of what the objects of their obsession should be like .
he creates a character identity instead of a reality .
and when a person steps outside of the parameters
that the unsub has set for them , he strikes .
this unsub appears to be triggered by males
acting on what he perceives to be character flaws .
seemingly innocuous infractions to us
are magnified in the unsub &apos;s psychosis .
based on the planning and sophistication of the kills ,
we believe that he &apos;s in his late 30s or 40s .
the geographic profile tells us this unsub
is not only dumping his victims downtown ,
he &apos;s hunting there , too .
so this is where we need to redouble our efforts .
go building to building , door to door .
this guy &apos;s a fly on the wall .
he &apos;s able to learn secrets without anyone realizing he &apos;s there .
he &apos;ll have a job that involves very little social interaction ,
but it puts him in a position
where he can observe others unnoticed .
so we should look at service workers ,
groundskeepers ,
anyone paid to be invisible .
and we need to move quickly .
this unsub is approaching some sort of perceived deadline .
the closer it gets , the more erratic and dangerous he &apos;ll become .
thank you .
hello ?
oh . can i help you , ms. fouladi ?
hey , nick . i was wondering
if i could take a look at your guest log .
a friend of mine came over the other night
and i lost his contact information .
i was hoping you might have it .
oh , well , let &apos;s take a look .
what was his name ?
scott . scott delfino .
scott delfino .
hmm . i &apos;m not seeing it .
you sure that &apos;s his name ?
yes .
oh , you know what ? this is only going back to yesterday .
looks like the old sheets have been filed .
and where would those be ?
in a box up in our storage attic .
tanner , our night guy , usually handles all of our paperwork .
i &apos;m pretty sure he can grab
those for you once he finishes his rounds .
is there any chance i could take a look right now ? please ?
it &apos;s important .
i &apos;m running kind of late , but , um ...
tell you what .
give this to tanner when you &apos;re done .
deal . thanks .
have a good night .
you , too .
talk to me , baby girl .
you better get ready to get down on one knee ,
&apos;cause this b.g. boo just earned herself
one hell of a diamond .
what &apos;d you find ?
scott delfino &apos;s phone is a hotch mess--
hot mess-- you know what i mean .
data scrambled like a denver omelet on a sunday morning .
i can feel those smoldering get @-@ to @-@ the @-@ point stares from here .
so i will .
if the name ashley is on scott &apos;s phone ,
i can &apos;t find it .
penelope , this is sounding more like cubic zirconia .
bite your pretty tongue . i didn &apos;t stop at the first rejection .
i did what you guys did . i profiled the guy .
scotty is a ladies &apos; man . gets a lot of names and numbers ,
gotta keep track of them all .
what &apos;s a player to do , playa ?
he gave her a nickname .
baby girl &apos;s already taken .
but bunny wasn &apos;t .
tell me you got a number .
of course i did . now so do you .
sending it now .
box .
which box ?
hello ?
i really wish you hadn &apos;t seen that .
no .
no .
help !
someone !
wait ! shh !
please ! please , no !
let me go ! please !
he killed a woman this time .
and she &apos;s also the first one he covered up .
this is remorse .
she wasn &apos;t part of the plan .
which explains why he moved the body .
she wasn &apos;t killed here .
and the garrote was used postmortem .
c.o.d. appears to be blunt force trauma to the back of the head .
he didn &apos;t do a good job of covering this up .
he &apos;s panicking .
we find where she was killed , we find him .
except no one even knows what her name is .
no i.d. just a phone .
one unheard message .
hi , my name is derek morgan with the fbi .
i &apos;m trying to locate a woman , first name ashley .
it &apos;s extremely important .
this is ashley .
her name is ashley fouladi .
she &apos;s a grad student at b.c.
bills , including rent and phone , are in her father &apos;s name .
that &apos;s why we couldn &apos;t find her .
you got an address , garcia ?
yeah . 2410 boylston street .
boylston street .
that &apos;s where colin kirkland lives ,
the boy who witnessed the attack on jake preston .
right , they &apos;re neighbors .
same building , different floor .
ashley wasn &apos;t planned ,
but scotty , the guy she was with , was .
right . and it wasn &apos;t ashley &apos;s neighbor colin who was targeted ,
it was jake , the boy he was with .
this unsub isn &apos;t stalking the people he kills ,
he &apos;s stalking the people that live in that building .
all of hs victims must have interacted
with someone residing there .
so , how does he choose who he kills ?
all right , well , let &apos;s look at it .
ashley comes home with a womanizer
who the unsub then killed .
colin was playing with a video game he wasn &apos;t supposed to have .
the unsub killed the boy who gave it to him .
he &apos;s targeting bad influences .
he sees himself as a protector .
or as a parent .
he &apos;s keeping the people under his own roof safe .
which mean he most likely suffered a past loss .
one he blames himself for .
agents . what can i do for you ?
one of your residents , ashley fouladi ,
was killed tonight .
we just want to ask you a few questions .
that &apos;s horrible .
did you happen to notice anything strange this evening ?
no . but i just got here .
our night guy had a family emergency ,
so i just got called back in .
did you interact with her earlier today ?
was she with anyone ?
no one was with her ,
but she did ask me about our visitor logs .
she was trying to find some guy &apos;s number
and i just sent her up to our storage room .
can you show us ?
yeah , yeah , of course .
right this way .
it &apos;s clear .
somebody &apos;s been living up here .
looks like he &apos;s making some sort of
collage or scrapbook or something .
this guy &apos;s got a view of the entire courtyard
and a half a dozen apartments .
he can see who &apos;s coming and going all day long .
look at this . it &apos;s a live feed .
so who else is he watching ?
that &apos;s tanner .
the guy i &apos;m covering for .
his name is tanner johnson and life has not been kind .
he lost a child , didn &apos;t he ?
yeah . last year .
a 10 @-@ year @-@ old son jeremy .
according to reports , jeremy was playing with a friend ,
they were like fake wrestling ,
when tanner , a free @-@ lance photographer
/ slash / nighttime doorman ,
got a call , left the room to take it .
when he returned , his son was unconscious .
the friend was trying to revive him
from a chokehold gone horribly wrong .
his son was strangled . that &apos;s why he uses a garrote .
jeremy was on life support for a few days ,
but he died .
tanner blames himself . he stopped watching for a minute
and he lost his son .
he hasn &apos;t stopped watching since .
the grief must have consumed him .
that &apos;s a hell of a stressor , but what triggered the murders ?
garcia , what happened to tanner &apos;s wife ?
did the marriage survive ?
no . she kicked him out two months ago ,
right before the killing started .
so he loses his child and then his wife and home .
it &apos;s enough to make anyone unstable .
add guilt to that and it &apos;s all too much .
he dissociated .
paternal transference .
he claimed the residents of his apartment building as his family .
but we &apos;re missing something . why is he documenting all of this ?
we profiled he &apos;s running out of time .
the book must have something to do with that .
oh , snap .
what is it , garcia ?
hannah , tanner &apos;s wife , she &apos;s pregnant .
that &apos;s who he &apos;s watching online .
garcia , when is the baby due ?
the baby &apos;s due ...
yesterday .
matt ? i think it &apos;s time .
your nephew &apos;s getting antsy .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m home .
and when the baby comes ,
we &apos;re gonna be a family again .
he &apos;s not picking up .
he &apos;s not going to . he &apos;s got what he wants .
i am checking hannah &apos;s social media footprint now .
it looks like her brother matt is staying with her until the baby &apos;s born .
i &apos;m sending you his number .
don &apos;t bother , garcia . i see him .
where ?
oh , god . god .
you killed him ? why ?
don &apos;t worry about him .
ohh ! sit down !
he &apos;s not gonna hurt hannah or the baby , will he ?
not while she &apos;s pregnant . he has to keep the child safe .
and after ?
look at me . look at me . we &apos;re gonna be a family again .
no , we can &apos;t be a family .
it didn &apos;t work .
but it will this time . it will ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ve changed !
i &apos;ve noticed .
i did everything you said .
and i &apos;m stronger now . i-- i can keep our family safe .
if you want to protect us ,
i need you to get me to a hospital .
please .
please .
no , no . i can &apos;t take you to the hospital .
something could happen to the baby .
oh , god ! that &apos;s exactly why you have to get me to a hospital .
no . no . something could go wrong .
oh , god . and it won &apos;t here ?
here ...
here ... i can help you .
you can &apos;t help me !
you &apos;re too weak !
you &apos;ve always been weak .
weak .
you won &apos;t say that after you &apos;ve seen this .
look . see ? look .
tanner thinks his book proves he can take care of the baby .
and if she rejects that , he could unravel even more .
uh @-@ huh , and what happens then ?
no one will be safe , not even the child .
look , look .
this is colin .
colin , see , he &apos;s a good boy , really .
till he met this kid , jake .
but i took care of him .
yeah .
and this man , scott .
ok ? i &apos;d seen him at the building before .
you see , ashley--ashley
thought she was the first girl he seduced there ,
but she wasn &apos;t . i made sure she was the last .
what is this ?
this is proof .
this is proof that i can protect our new baby .
this is proof .
yeah .
proof that i &apos;m never ,
never gonna let anything or anyone ever hurt him .
you &apos;re ...
insane .
no .
put it down .
you can &apos;t be in here .
tanner , think about what you &apos;re doing .
you don &apos;t want to hurt your baby , do you ?
that &apos;s what happened to jeremy .
go away ! just get out of here !

tanner , you need to let her go .
the stress isn &apos;t good for the baby .
if hannah doesn &apos;t start pushing now we could lose the child .
i have to watch him . i have to keep him safe .
like you did with ashley ?
that was an accident . i didn &apos;t mean to .
i know you didn &apos;t . accidents happen .

&quot; the most important thing that parents can teach their children
is how to get along without them . &quot;
frank clark .
and to dr. spencer reid ,
who may be adding m.d.
to an already impressive list of credentials .
and to spencer johnson , may he prove to be the child prodigy
like his namesake .
how on earth did you know what to do ?
when jj was pregnant with henry , i memorized the delivery manuals
just in case she went into labor in the field .
i have to admit the practical application
did not quite live up to the theory .
no , you were great , spence .
thanks . this night is not about me , though . to dave rossi .
oh , i still can &apos;t believe you guys did this .
we wanted to make sure you had one last proper goodbye .

have posted on the quantico message boards
that all the drinks are on you tonight .
