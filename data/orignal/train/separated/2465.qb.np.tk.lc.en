alaric &apos;s babies are the future of the coven .
they would have protected them in any way they could .
they &apos;re inside of you .
then why are you here , lorenzo ?
i &apos;m here because of you .
who &apos;s julian ?
he was the love of my life .
your grandchild was murdered by julian .
we bound julian &apos;s life to mine .
we &apos;re linked . if he dies , so do i.
our mother faked her death ,
left her sons behind , started a new family ,
and went out of her way to forget us forever !
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
she deserves what she gets .
did you know valerie was once
pregnant with stefan &apos;s child ?
valerie ? no .
i love you , darling .
i will never hurt you .
you were right about julian ,
but i am not going to let him hurt us anymore .
i have a plan , and this time , we won &apos;t get caught .
where am i ?
that &apos;s right , dallas .
the home of big hair and horrible presidents .
and the trap you just walked into .
unfortunately , you &apos;re not the fly i was hoping to catch .
oh , so , the mystery guest makes an appearance .
why don &apos;t you do me a favor ?
come a little closer so i can sort of see you .
mom ?
it &apos;s been a long time .
what &apos;s the plan ?
julian needs to die today .
everything has to appear to be normal .
julian &apos;s not an idiot .
if he finds out that lily turned on him , we &apos;re all dead .
so you embed her with a psychopath .
sounds logical .
hey , don &apos;t look at me ; i voted to drive
a stake through her heart and get rid of this
julian mama drama once and for all .
but , hey , complicated plan &quot; a &quot; sounds like a happy compromise .
it &apos;s not complicated .
we get julian &apos;s blood , and then , nora ,
beau , or mary louise use it
to unlink him from lily , and we kill the bastard .
uh , you glossed over the important bit .
do you really think that beau , mary louise ,
and nora are going to help ?
okay . that &apos;s it .
nora is off pancake duty .
me ? you &apos;re the one who wanted the chocolate chips to melt .
melt , not burn the house down and kill us all--
nobody &apos;s killing anybody before we eat .
i &apos;m not wasting any of this food .
darling . we woke you .
aren &apos;t we having fun ?
julian treats lily &apos;s heretics
like they &apos;re his own royal children .
and they worship him right back ; they &apos;ll never turn on him .
the old stake through the heart &apos;s lookin &apos; like
a pretty good alternative right now .
just sayin &apos; .
well , i guess the only way we &apos;re gonna be able to pull this off
is to deploy the nuclear option .
which is ?
me .
i know how to win them over to our side .
uh , great , yeah . last i checked ,
she was the black sheep of the family .
what are you gonna tell them to make them feel otherwise ?
the truth .
this looks like quite the feast . what &apos;s the occasion ?
don &apos;t tell me you forgot .
forgot what ?
it &apos;s our anniversary .
mary lou and i have been together for 133 years .
of course she remembered .
in fact ,
it was lily &apos;s idea to host your party tonight .
really ?
lily salvatore throws a party ?
let me guess , we &apos;ll get drunk on tea and do needlepoint .
oh , yes , nothing says
&quot; i &apos;ve loved you for over a century &quot;
like falling asleep by 9 : 15 .
girls , girls , girls , girls ,
you &apos;re underestimating us .
i think they &apos;re in for a wonderful surprise ,
don &apos;t you , my love ?
yes .
yes , quite the surprise .
&quot; dear elena , i &apos;m pregnant . &quot;
&quot; ridiculously long story short ,
they &apos;re ric and jo &apos;s twin babies ,
magically transported into my readily available womb
by the gemini coven .
i guess i thought writing to you might help me figure out
how i &apos;m supposed to feel about the whole thing
because on one hand , i know how much this means to alaric ,
and on the other ,
i have no idea what it means for me . &quot;
breaking news .
remember all those people julian was stockpiling ?
they disappeared this morning .
that &apos;s weird . where did they go ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on .
you want to cut class today and help me get to the bottom of it ?
actually , i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m ...
turns out valerie was right .
wait . you &apos;re really pregnant ?
yup .
how &apos;d stefan take it ?
oh , you know ,
totally supportive and
just wanted to make sure that i was ok .
at least , that &apos;s how i &apos;m hoping it goes when i tell him today .
what are you doing here , lorenzo ?
oh , looking for the self @-@ help section .
seems i &apos;ve developed , um , feelings
for someone with terrible taste ,
and yet ... i can &apos;t seem to shake her .
i need to get something
for nora and mary lou &apos;s anniversary .
nora used to read this poem
over and over again when we were trapped together .
i believe it was called &quot; the nymph &apos;s reply to the shepherd . &quot;
&quot; but could youth last and love still breed ,
&quot; had joys no date , nor age no need ,
&quot; then these delights my mind might move
&quot; to live with thee
and be thy love . &quot;
i had no idea you enjoyed poetry .
well , there &apos;s a lot about me that you haven &apos;t ...
allowed yourself to know .
the poems of sir walter raleigh ,
a proper englishman .
oh , this looks like a decent edition .
do you really think some bauble will convince the heretics
to side with you over an evil step @-@ daddy
who spoils them rotten with ponies and ice cream ?
i don &apos;t have a choice .
yes , you do .
run . leave town with me .
let your sons carry out their plan
while you &apos;re off the grid .
oh , lorenzo ...
i can &apos;t run from this .
this is my doing .
you &apos;re not safe .
come with me .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
but if you could ...
if i could ...
good luck , lily .
you &apos;ll need it .
i can &apos;t see a bloody thing .
that &apos;s the point .
julian . enough games .
as you wish .
this is epic .
who are all these people ?
friends , food , whatever you want them to be .
they &apos;ve all been compelled to see to your every desire .
but there are so many .
i &apos;ve been collecting them for this very occasion .
are you ill ?
lily would never allow this .
come on . it &apos;s your anniversary .
let &apos;s have a drink to celebrate .
what is going on here ?
loosen up , darling . it &apos;s a party .
the rule is we may feed on trespassers .
one here , maybe another there , but
where did all these people come from , julian ?
they certainly didn &apos;t bus themselves in to be our dinner .
see ? i told you she was incapable of fun .
come on . let &apos;s go before she ruins our entire night .
however ...
i suppose , since it &apos;s a special occasion ,
we can make an exception .
see ? just like old times .
damon .
lily just texted me their location . let &apos;s do this .
i , uh , thought you were studying .
i was , but i &apos;m here now . surprise .
ah , stefan distraction machine .
please tell me you &apos;re not coming .
coming where ?
nora and mary louise &apos;s anniversary .
great . you &apos;re here , too .
that &apos;s ... perfect .
uh , what are--what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m ...
spit it out , blondie .
you know what ? damon and i will go together .
stefan can follow behind .
what ? no .
yes . let &apos;s go .
what was that all about ?
we need to talk .
i know , it &apos;s insane .
magical baby transplants ? i ...
i didn &apos;t believe it , either , but then i
ate 9 ice cream sundaes from noon to 3 : 00,
and none of my clothes fit , and then there was
that whole part with the doctor and the ultrasound , so ...
right .
yeah .
you can say something .
uh , i don &apos;t think there are any words .
i know .
i know .
i have to go .
what ?
i mean , obviously we need to talk about this , um ,
but ... we have this small window
to get to julian tonight , and this is sort of ...
bad ... timing ? i mean , trust me , i get it .
no , no , no , it &apos;s ...
i mean , yes , it--yes ,
um , but we will talk about it when i get back .
ok .
promise .
where are you taking me ?
quiet . i need your opinion .
do you think she &apos;ll say yes ?
she loves you . she would have said yes
when it would have gotten her beheaded .
why am i so nervous ?
probably because the love of your life is far too vain
to be wearing whatever that tiny little rock is ,
reflecting light in that box .
lily doesn &apos;t allow us to leave mystic falls , so
my options were limited to coal @-@ miner chic .
a relationship as beautiful as yours
deserves something a little better .
this belonged to french royalty .
a , uh , princess , i think .
she was telling me as she lost her head .
it &apos;s perfect .
oh , the perfect ring for the perfect couple .
i &apos;m so happy for you both .
this is what i read to everyone in that horrible prison world .
i thought it &apos;d be a nice anniversary gift .
it reminds me of everything
we &apos;ve been through together as a family .
thank you , lily .
this is so special . i love it .
guess who .
the man i chose above all others .
i &apos;ll leave you two lovebirds alone .
dance with me .
i have no idea how to dance to this kind of music .
no , no , no , fear not .
i bribed the deejay to play us a slow song .
do you recognize it ?
should i ?
not the arrangement , but perhaps the vocals .
i &apos;ll never forget that voice .
he used to sing so beautifully .
to think of everything we &apos;ve endured as a family ...
and now we &apos;re together ,
at long last .
like old times .
well , almost like old times .
you haven &apos;t been indulging in any of the real fun .
no , i &apos;m perfectly content with blood bags .
no , no , you &apos;re afraid .
afraid of what ?
going all in ...
and rejoining our family completely .
you keep holding on to the hope
that stefan and damon will love you again ,
that we &apos;ll be one big happy family , but we can &apos;t , hmm ?
and that hope is causing unwanted friction .
take a look around .
you have all the love that you need right here .
all you have to do is accept it .
come back to us , lily .
let go and allow yourself to be the woman
that i fought through hell for .
looks like someone &apos;s having fun .
i had to feed .
i have to convince them that i &apos;m on their side .
sounds like something straight out of rippers anonymous .
plan &apos;s postponed till further notice .
no , no , no , no , look .
valerie will get through to them . the plan must go forward .
i can &apos;t spend another minute with that man .
fine .
julian dies tonight ,
but it &apos;s no skin off my back if you &apos;re still linked
to the guy when i shove a stake through his heart .
yes , you made that perfectly clear
when you tried to kill him yesterday .
what do you want from me , an apology ?
ain &apos;t gonna happen . i &apos;m only here because stefan &apos;s a mommy &apos;s boy .
i don &apos;t want the silent treatment for the next century--
i am your mother .
how can you be so cavalier about my life ?
because you &apos;re already dead to me , lily .
i was 17 . you went away . i cried .
i grew up . you being here doesn &apos;t change any of that .
if i had to do it all over again , i &apos;d have left you
in that damn prison world
so that i didn &apos;t have to see your face again .
mare .
this is gorgeous . did you do all this ?
mostly .
julian and beau helped .
what &apos;s that ?
a gift for us .
&quot; but could youth last and love still breed ,
have joys no date , nor age no need &quot; --
marry me .
133 years is not enough , nora .
i want eternity .
yes .
really ?
yes . of course , yes .
i &apos;m happy for you two .
what are you doing here ,
besides destroying the greatest moment of my life ?
we need to talk
about the worst moment of mine .
let her go .
oh , so , so sorry , officer .
i found this one wandering about
and assumed she was of , uh ... drinking age .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
well , let &apos;s just say i didn &apos;t get the girl .
i don &apos;t think the life @-@ saving business suits you , mate .
yeah , why don &apos;t you tell that to the girl
whose throat you were about to tear out ?
mmm , yeah , well ,
i suppose that brings your tally to a whopping one .
damon didn &apos;t want you ,
lily didn &apos;t want you ,
and this town never wanted you ,
so what are you still doing here ?
i might ask the same thing about you .
the heretics are throwing a murder party
in your precious hometown ,
and all you can manage to stop
is my buzz !
you &apos;re overmatched .
you &apos;ve brought a knife to a gunfight ,
and it &apos;s gonna be the death of you .
this is so typical .
nora and i have one night a year ,
and valerie can &apos;t stop herself from trying to steal the spotlight .
this isn &apos;t about me .
it &apos;s about our family .
hold on . where &apos;s julian ?
we should wait for him .
julian won &apos;t be joining us .
hell of a party .
well , your mother would agree .
there &apos;s a kindergarten teacher in the powder room to prove it .
oh , good old mom .
bet she made you think she enjoyed it , too , huh ?
his face went cold .
i couldn &apos;t fight him off .
i couldn &apos;t--i couldn &apos;t stop him .
julian beat me savagely
and ... when it was finally over ,
my baby was dead .
murdering my child wasn &apos;t just some violent whim .
it was a calculated , manipulative act .
what are you boys doing here ?
it &apos;s an anniversary party ; guess we figured we &apos;d
come support the pretty one and her mean girlfriend .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
why would julian do such a thing ? what did he stand to gain ?
me .
i would have never gone to europe with him
had i known about my grandson .
grandson ?
stefan was the baby &apos;s father .
i couldn &apos;t cope .
i took my own life and became the first heretic .
and when julian saw how powerful i was , he wanted more .
we &apos;re his army , we &apos;re not his family .
we always have been .
lily ... is that true ?
i believe every word valerie said .
when she told me what happened to her , it was
as if all the lights in the room went on ...
and i could finally see julian for who he really is .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m leaving him .
she can &apos;t do it without your help ,
so the question is ... who do you believe ?
mare . you heard what she said . what are you waiting for ?
sorry . it &apos;s just this is a lot to take in .
that &apos;s why we stick together .
we &apos;re family .
beau , give me your hand .
what is she doing ?
bracing herself .
for what ?
lily , you &apos;re bleeding .
it &apos;s about to get a lot worse .
let &apos;s tie him up .
damon &apos;s tying up julian right now .
i , uh , got his blood .
good .
they &apos;re waiting for it in the greenhouse .
caroline &apos;s pregnant .
yeah , i didn &apos;t really know what to say , either .
do i even want to know how this happened ?
gemini spell .
twins .
not mine , obviously .
you must be overwhelmed .
well , i didn &apos;t exactly , um ,
handle things the right way .
any advice ?
tell her you love her .
never forget what she must be going through .
and then , one day ...
be prepared for her to sacrifice everything for them .
not that i &apos;m one to give advice .
i chose julian over everything .
yeah , but now he &apos;s gonna die ,
and you can start over without him .
it &apos;s too late ,
and so much has already been lost .
you haven &apos;t lost me .
really ?
i guess , uh ...
willingness to forgive the unforgivable
is in my genetics .
and unfortunately , damon ...
doesn &apos;t feel the same way about forgiveness .
look , you were the first woman to break his heart .
he &apos;s put up a wall ever since .
but ... you can take it down .
no .
he &apos;s gone .
i saw it in his eyes .
he @-@ he wishes me dead .
do you think that i haven &apos;t seen that look before ?
damon has been practicing that look on me
for the last 150 years .
well , then maybe you could offer your mother
a little advice in return .
how do i get him back ?
time .
and my mind is boggled
by this blind devotion you have for lily ,
when the woman mused up an idea
to keep you away from your soulmate for what ,
60 years , 70 years ?
stop talking .
and yet here you are ,
essentially risking your life to be here
with me in order to keep her alive .
don &apos;t listen to him . he knows he &apos;s dead either way .
but if he can provoke you to kill him now ,
then you spend eternity as the boy who killed his own mother .
mmm , aren &apos;t you a clever girl ?
it &apos;s a shame .
i suppose your little one would have had the same smarts ...
rot in hell , julian .
what is this ?
apparently whoever wins at foosball gets to kill me .
it &apos;s pinball , and i have the high score .
did you break that link yet ?
how do i know
that you were pregnant with stefan &apos;s child ?
are you testing me ?
do you really believe that i would make that up ?
you lied to lily about your affair with stefan ,
just like you lied to us about killing oscar ,
so why should i believe that you &apos;re telling the truth now ?
all right , nancy grace , enough .
let the adults handle this .
what are you doing ?
and that , mary louise ,
is why you &apos;ve always been my favorite .
well , you &apos;re either really drunk
or calling to tell me that you found a new girlfriend .
none of the above .
although a drink does sound really good right about now .
yeah , tell me about it .
listen , i &apos;m really sorry about earlier .
i didn &apos;t know what to say , and
i didn &apos;t want to say the wrong thing , so i just ...
bailed .
well , i guess there &apos;s no right thing to say
when you find out your girlfriend is
magically pregnant with another man &apos;s babies .
look , i know
that this is happening to both of us .
and you stood by me through ...
everything i went through with my mom ,
so i totally get it if you want to run for the hills .
i &apos;m not going anywhere
because i love you .
i guess there is a right thing to say after all .
listen , no matter how ...
weird this all gets ... i &apos;m here for you .
we &apos;re gonna get through this together .
are you sure ? &apos; cause it could get really weird .
i &apos;m positive .
ok .
i love you , too .
mare .
hey . where are you going ?
we still need to unlink lily .
i have to get out of here .
mare , stop .
you &apos;ve been crying .
what happened ?
oh , my god .
things have grown out of hand , lily .
enough is enough .
what are you doing ? let them go .
i can &apos;t
&apos;cause if i do ,
this bloody cycle will continue .
and i love you-- and the family that we have built together--
far too much for that to happen .
so ...
one lives , one dies .
you have to choose which .
i will do no such thing .
oh , but you will .
you have spent far too long trying to have it all .
the lies , the-- the violence ,
all because you wanted the impossible .
well , the truth is ,
you &apos;re either a salvatore
or you &apos;re one of us ,
but you cannot be both .
now choose .
choose .
how could you do that to lily ?
how could valerie have done what she has to us ?
she hasn &apos;t been truthful about anything , nora .
her relationship with stefan ? lies .
killing oscar ? more lies .
this is different .
of course you would think that .
he took her child from her ,
and you would side with him ?
and you would side with a girl who murdered her own brother ?
no . what are you doing ?
this doesn &apos;t represent our love ,
it represents julian &apos;s ability to manipulate us .
i don &apos;t want it .
nora , please--
i don &apos;t want any of it .
nora . nora !
this isn &apos;t you .
this is not the man that i fell in love with .
you used to be kind ,
gentle , funny .
no , no , you--you &apos;re still in shock
from the hell that you &apos;ve been trapped in for so long .
hell didn &apos;t turn him evil , lily .
he was born this way .
ok , this vervain stings like a bitch ,
and your family drama makes the prospect of hell
look like disneyland .
so , please ,
one swift stab straight through the heart .
let &apos;s get this over with .
you chose your heretics over stefan and me
every chance you had . why stop now ?
lily , please .
you are such a strong girl .
i am so sorry i didn &apos;t see it sooner .
my son ...
please forgive me .
kill me !
come on . do it , lily .
you &apos;re wrong about so many things .
i never had the courage to tell you before ...
but i do now .
you ... are wrong , julian .
i can choose them both .
no ! lily !
lily .
lily .
my sweet , foolish girl .
i &apos;ve already unlinked us .
no .
lily !
save your strength . you &apos;re full of vervain .
you couldn &apos;t break out of here on your best day .
what the hell did you do ?
i took your advice .
you see , you &apos;re right .
i can &apos;t protect mystic falls on my own ,
so i made some friends who could help .
who are these friends ?
sorry , i can &apos;t tell you .
see , they &apos;d like to introduce themselves .
i guess i was wrong .
someone wanted you after all .
the splinters must be inside your heart .
i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t get them out .
nora ... it &apos;s all right .
what do i do ?
tell me what to do !
you say good @-@ bye .
we wouldn &apos;t be a family without you , lily .
i love you .
i am so sorry this happened .
good @-@ bye .
i guess ...
only one of us
gets the luxury of time .
promise me you &apos;ll use yours
to the fullest .
nora gave me back the ring .
what is all this ?
lily , uh ...
she staked herself in her heart .
what ?
she thought that killing herself would kill me .
she didn &apos;t realize that you had already unlinked us .
i thought breaking the spell would protect her .
if her sons succeeded in killing me ...
she would be spared , but it &apos;s--
no . no . tell me this isn &apos;t real .
tell me this isn &apos;t happening !
she &apos;s gone , mary louise . she &apos;s gone .
i forgive you for loving him , lily .
you just wanted to love us all .
there &apos;s no sin in that .
she only has moments left .
make the most of them .
damon .
i &apos;m truly sorry .
say something .
you made your bed .
have a nice nap .
mom ?
are you still here ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i don &apos;t think i can save you .
you &apos;ve been poisoned with werewolf toxin .
without proper treatment ,
you will die soon .
okay , mom , listen .
why are you still here ?
there is something that &apos;s been nagging of me for
a long time .
i &apos;m so sorry .
mom ?
you must really be having a bad trip .
you mother &apos;s been dead for years .
you are not my mother ?
