第六季 第十三集
you &apos;re hurting me , bernard .
oh . it is a good hurt ,
is it not ?
please , no .
don &apos;t kill me .
did you write that , mr. tierney ?
i did .
you produce this show , call it murder ?
i do . proudly .
oh , i &apos;m glad .
is that colin sweeney ?
no . no , that is a fictional character
named bernard loomis .
you &apos;re aware that my client was found
not guilty of murdering his wife ?
i am aware , but , again ,
this character is not based on him .
i see . but you cast an actor
who looks just like colin sweeney .
that &apos;s a coincidence .
even though he has the same occupation ,
dresses identically , met his wife in a similar fashion ,
and even though mr. sweeney &apos;s wife ,
like the wife in your show ,
was strangled and found buried in an orchard ,
and her decapitated head was discovered in mr. sweeney &apos;s yard ,
despite all of these similarities ,
you still insist that
mr. loomis is not based on mr. sweeney ?
i do .
isn &apos;t the only difference
between mr. sweeney and your character
that the latter killed his wife ?
well , i think that there are many people
who think that mr. sweeney did kill his wife .
so there &apos;s no difference between the two ?
he didn &apos;t say that .
argumentative , your honor .
this is galling .
i will rephrase .
i don &apos;t wish to gall , ms. krause .
uh , mr. tierney , you were quoted
by the television critics association
saying , &quot; all our episodes
are ripped straight from the headlines . &quot;
so which headline was this episode ripped from ?
i was exaggerating . not all the episodes .
this one was not .
i see .
the one episode in which your studio is being sued for defamation ?
again , argumentative . your honor ,
i wish you would admonish plaintiff &apos;s attorney .
and i wish you &apos;d stop overdramatizing your objections , counselor .
i get it . sustained .
talk about how he &apos;s ruining my reputation .
mr. sweeney , please . trust me .
so , mr. tierney ,
let &apos;s talk about the casting process for this role .
how many actors
did you read for the part of bernard loomis ?
hello .
thanks for seeing me .
no problem .
you &apos;re doing well .
so are you .
no . i shouldn &apos;t have walked out on that debate .
i listened to my handlers .
sometimes they &apos;re right , sometimes they &apos;re wrong .
i want to play something for you .
are we back @-@ channeling ?
we are .
hello , this is brian rogers .
i &apos;m a rainbow brigade activist
who just loves frank prady .
he &apos;s a great supporter of our cause , and i want to remind you
to support him and not alicia ...
what is that ?
uh , that &apos;s a robocall
put out by your campaign .
no .
yes .
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
gays are your coalition , not ours .
oh , this robocall
was sent only to suburban homes in evanston .
you understand ? it &apos;s a false flag .
it &apos;s intended to piss off
conservatives so they &apos;ll send money to you .
i have no knowledge of this .
i didn &apos;t think you did .
that is why i have brought that knowledge to you .
frank prady is a great supporter of gay marriage .
he wants to focus resources on boystown in lake view
and not in evanston . you see ?
plays off all the worst stereotypes .
if you support this , please come to our rally this saturday .
excuse me . sorry .
yes , hello .
uh , no , it &apos;s frank .
no , we haven &apos;t released any robocalls .
josh !
it was disgusting .
the worst kind of politics .
a lisping voice . going out to conservatives .
we didn &apos;t do it , alicia . hey , josh .
have we released any false flag robocalls ?
three weeks before the election ? are you kidding me ?
we &apos;d @-@ we &apos;d wait until three days before , maybe .
do you want anything , alicia ? there are cookies ...
adults are talking here . can you give us a minute ?
no , marissa , come in .
actually , alicia ,
we need a minute .
i &apos;d like marissa to stay .
you mean with the adults ? are you sure ?
are you in touch with the pac , jon ?
am i ? no , that would be illegal .
when i wanted the pac to stop their attack ads ,
i told you and they did .
yes ,
because they knew it was wrong .
right , josh ?
yes .
what &apos;s @ tobyziegler44 ?
excuse me ?
tobyziegler44 .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a campaign twitter account .
how do you know about it ?
of course .
the chatty body woman .
it &apos;s a dormant
twitter account . we rarely use it .
and yet we used it last night .
4th : 40 / 43 @-@ soft .
3rd 44 / 44 . &quot;
can i interrupt here ?
the candidate should not be talking about this .
it &apos;s our polling data , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s a code ? 4th ward .
we &apos;re soft there .
40 % to prady &apos;s 43 % .
it &apos;s a message to the pac ,
telling them where to focus soft money .
awkward silence .
it is a public twitter account .
we release random data anyone can access .
it &apos;s not illegal .
it &apos;s a loophole in the campaign laws .
okay , this is what i need .
use your little decoder ring
and your west wing tweets to tell the pac
to stop these homophobic robocalls .
that &apos;s all i ask .
you do know we &apos;re behind .
no . polling has me within the margin of error .
not polling .
cash . prady got an influx of late campaign cash .
from where ?
no idea . maybe out of state .
he &apos;s popular in california .
who &apos;s redmayne ?
what ?
redmayne . i recognize the name ,
but i don &apos;t know who it is .
guy redmayne .
he &apos;s a democratic mega @-@ donor out of phoenix .
why ?
i can &apos;t tell you how i know this , but i know this .
redmayne &apos;s in touch with prady .
how do you know this ?
i just said i can &apos;t tell you .
do you know this
or do you suspect it ?
i know this .
we &apos;re screwed .
i &apos;ll get cookies .
jerome morris .
actor , raconteur , teacher ...
and you played bernard loomis in call it murder ?
i did . i like the small screen .
there &apos;s , uh , so many more challenges .
oh , my . he is a cartoon .
what have you done prior to this ? is that it , the casting tape ?
yes .
you &apos;re a lifesaver , kalinda .
uh , i stood by for several roles ...
hello ?
mr. bishop ?
why does it take you eight rings to answer ?
uh , i was in court , sir .
uh , do you need something ?
i do . the favor .
the one you owe me .
yeah , uh , look , if this has anything to do
with florrick @-@ agos , we could always just bill it
through the firm .
no . it doesn &apos;t .
what is it , sir ?
and in inhabiting mr. loomis ,
were you ever directed to base your part on mr. sweeney ?
no , i base my performance on life .
uh , i build a performance from here .
uh , let the record reflect i was pointing to my ear .
actually , uh , mr. morris , that &apos;s my job .
my apologies , your honor .
uh , i did inherit the wind .
would you admit that you bear a striking resemblance to mr. sweeney ?
he &apos;s , what , ten years my senior ?
we share a certain ... je ne sais quoi ...
and don &apos;t you think that similarity suggests exactly
to the audience who you &apos;re portraying ?
no , i created an entirely original character .
but your inflections in this episode
are identical to mr. sweeney . i mean ...
it was masterful , the way that you copied him .
objection . your honor ,
uh , counsel is attempting to trick the witness with flattery .
i was just complimenting a performance .
sustained .
ask the same thing without the compliment .
mr. morris , were you ever directed
to play the part like mr. sweeney ?
no . never .
i am nothing like him .
he &apos;s like my retarded brother . shh .
let me play you a tape , mr. morris .
y @-@ you want it more serious ?
no , but do you know colin sweeney ?
do it like colin sweeney .
would you like to revise your testimony , mr. morris ?
what do you mean ?
you just said you were never directed
to base your performance on colin sweeney .
wasn &apos;t that the producer doing exactly that ?
that was an audition .
nothing is very serious at an audition .
nothing further .
mr. morris , were you directed
to base your performance on anyone else ?
what do you mean ?
like ... claus von bulow ... like ...
objection , your honor . leading .
sustained .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
i was just trying to save some time .
were you directed to base your performance
on any other accused killers ?
yes , i was . that one .
claus von bulow ,
for ... for example .
you have to be at the shriners in one hour .
i just need to pick up a few things ...
you &apos;re not answering my texts .
i &apos;m a bit busy , mr. sweeney .
i told you , she &apos;s campaigning .
she doesn &apos;t have time .
i &apos;m unhappy .
does it matter to you that i &apos;m unhappy ?
does it matter to me that you &apos;re unhappy ?
um , not so much .
you prepped for this trial , alicia .
ten months ago , you swore to me that you could win this .
no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , when you wanted me to stay on as a client .
no . in fact , i told you to drop it ,
that defamation was hard to win ,
but that if you wanted to pursue it , we would do our best ,
and we did . and we are .
no , you said you would do your best .
and you ...
are not . hello .
hi . marissa . i &apos;m the body woman .
really ?
the whole body ? or just parts ?
marissa , why don &apos;t you wait outside .
just ignore him . he likes unsettling people .
hi . i &apos;m renata .
don &apos;t worry . i don &apos;t unsettle easily .
oh , don &apos;t tell him that . it &apos;s a challenge .
here , sit .
we take your business seriously , mr. sweeney .
we have two name partners fighting for you in court .
yes , but diane and cary don &apos;t like me .
i don &apos;t like you either .
don &apos;t be silly .
this tv show makes me out to be a killer .
herald equity &apos;s stock has plunged 56 % ,
and the board will fire me
if i can &apos;t clear my name .
israel . i was in the idf .
oh . the army .
yeah . two years . lone soldier .
so you carried a gun . what kind ?
tar @-@ 21 . assault rifle .
oh , my god .
did you kill anyone ?
no .
oh . but you wanted to .
i wanted action .
just so i could write about it .
a frustrated novelist .
me , too .
i will leave here .
i will leave your firm .
go ahead , mr. sweeney . i don &apos;t care .
you &apos;re heartless .
no , i just know that you won &apos;t .
i know when you &apos;re bluffing .
okay . try this bluff .
i know who finances your pac .
that brought you up short .
how would that sound ,
me telling the press who &apos;s laundering his money
through your pac ?
okay , mr. sweeney .
i will consult with diane and cary .
i will look through the evidence .
but i won &apos;t be in court .
i won &apos;t be seen with you .
that &apos;s the best i can offer ,
and if you don &apos;t want to take it ,
go ahead , go to the press .
come on , marissa .
you &apos;re late .
tell marcus : wait on the delivery .
i need you at this address at 3 : 00 tomorrow .
and every day this week and next week .
you &apos;ll be picking someone up .
look ...
i &apos;m not really a bodyguard , sir ,
but i can hire somebody ...
no .
i need someone who doesn &apos;t look like a bodyguard .
why ?
dylan &apos;s school doesn &apos;t like people who look like bodyguards .
this is for dylan ?
yes . that &apos;s the address of his school .
i need you to pick him up and drive him home
after school every day for the next two weeks .
i don &apos;t mean to offend you , sir ,
but i &apos;m ...
then don &apos;t .
my son means everything to me .
i am trusting you with the most valuable thing in my life .
you understand ?
what is this ?
the original casting breakdown .
i don &apos;t know what that is .
it &apos;s a breakdown of the characters ,
sent out to agents to get casting .
where did you get that ?
as you can see , your honor ,
these are the original names of the characters ,
before the studio &apos;s legal department
advised the production to change them .
your honor , clearly the plaintiff has been diving
into dumpsters for this proprietary information .
but why is this bad , counselors ?
instruct me .
the name of the murdered wife is carolyn .
the name of the murderer is colin .
the name of the detective is rick crowell .
these are all the names
of the real people in the colin sweeney case .
i am ...
outraged , your honor .
well , you &apos;re welcome to your outrage , ms. krause ,
but i am inclined to decide that the plaintiff
has proved likeness .
i believe that this episode , though fictionalized ,
does defame mr. sweeney .
unless you have something else .
i do .
your honor ,
i do have something more .
the episode
does not defame colin sweeney
because it is , in fact , true .
colin sweeney killed his wife .
your honor , this is crazy .
are you kidding me ?
the episode depicts something that actually happened .
colin sweeney was found not guilty by a jury of his peers .
yes , but the threshold for truth is higher in a criminal court .
you ready to prove colin sweeney murdered his wife ?
yes , your honor .
well , i won &apos;t stop you .
we &apos;ll meet this afternoon to hear the defense &apos;s case .
okay , guy redmayne , born dallas 1942 .
瑞德梅恩扭转民主党形势
the oldest of three siblings .
made his fortune in real estate .
pro @-@ israel .
he &apos;s the player
in democratic circles .
the pac he runs
helped 72 democrats get elected last year .
who &apos;s that , his wife ?
no , that &apos;s his daughter , crystal .
you &apos;ll meet her at the club , too .
what time ?
4 : 00 . and he &apos;s squeezing us in ,
so you &apos;ll have to move fast .
which means
you need to learn how to ask for things . let &apos;s hear it .
what , now ?
yeah , why ? come on .
ask me for money .
my name &apos;s alicia florrick .
thank you for meeting me .
i hope you &apos;ll consider ... no . no qualifiers .
you don &apos;t hope that someone will consider .
i &apos;d like your ...
no .
own it .
i want your support .
i believe together we can influence ...
not influence-- accomplish .
you &apos;re a doer , so do .
give me your money . now .
that &apos;s closer , but it &apos;s not funny .
think of how bill clinton does it .
do you want to be a part of my movement ?
then give . you &apos;ll be joining something
bigger than yourself ;
you &apos;ll be helping the world .
it &apos;s to their benefit , not to yours .
the money &apos;s weighing them down ,
so relieve them of it .
this is ghastly .
mr. sweeney , shh .
yes , 911 .
hello . my name is bernard loomis ...
and i think something has happened to my wife ...
one second .
uh , i &apos;ll call you back .
detective crowell ,
how accurate would you say that sequence is ?
i worked the case , and i &apos;m a technical advisor on the show--
that &apos;s exactly how mr. sweeney covered up the murder .
there was a rug missing from mr. sweeney &apos;s house ,
mr. sweeney had a receipt
for a gallon jug of lye in his work @-@ shed .
his lawyer convinced the judge
the warrants didn &apos;t cover &quot; detached dwellings . &quot;
detective , did the actual colin sweeney
make a 911 call when he buried his wife ?
uh ... i &apos;m sorry-- when he discovered
his wife was missing ?
yes , he did .
i &apos;d like to play it for the court .
yes , 911 .
hello . my name is colin sweeney ,
and i think something has happened to my wife .
one second . uh ...
i &apos;ll call you back .
my goodness .
that &apos;s very similar to the 911 call on the show .
yes , identical .
nothing further .
detective , how many times
have you testified against mr. sweeney ?
four times . this is my fourth .
and each time you &apos;ve lost--
sweeney was cleared of all charges ?
we call him the luckiest murderer on the planet .
i see . and given this attitude ,
don &apos;t you have an ax to grind ?
no .
in fact , haven &apos;t you admitted ...
sidebar , your honor .
let &apos;s go . come on up .
what &apos;s eating you , ms. krause ?
your honor , plaintiff &apos;s counsel
is preparing to introduce e @-@ mails ...
she can &apos;t ...
wait a minute .
e @-@ mails in which detective crowell
insists that he will , quote ,
&quot; get sweeney eventually &quot; &quot; unquote ,
but their investigator
hacked into the detective &apos;s account
and obtained the e @-@ mails illegally .
counselors , is this true ?
damn it . how did she find out ?
david lee .
no , he wouldn &apos;t do that . would he ?
kalinda , who else knew about these crowell e @-@ mails ?
the judge is rejecting them as illegally obtained .
only you and cary .
look , i &apos;ll look into it as soon as i get back , okay ?
bye .
it &apos;s illegal to drive and talk on the phone .
it &apos;s a $ 75 fine .
but it &apos;s more with a child in the car .
should we just try silence for a moment , dylan ? hmm ?
where are you going ?
a different way .
this is the way to brian &apos;s house .
he was my best friend , uh , but he moved .
he moved to las vegas .
he &apos;s the only one whose parents let him come over to my house .
dylan , i need you to do me a favor .
scoot down in your seat .
why ?
just do it .
this is rl @-@ 567 .
i need to check a license
on an illinois plate : rfi56th .
i &apos;ll hold .
all american mike says that my dad killed my mom .
what ?
he &apos;s a kid at my school .
all american mike , he , uh ...
he says my dad killed my mom .
well , why would he say that ?
i don &apos;t know .
he said it was true .
someone is leaking to the defense .
i don &apos;t like being undercut by my own firm .
yeah . that &apos;s too bad .
do you trust cary agos ?
what ? cary agos .
is he leaking ?
no .
who , then ?
if you lose your seat on the board ,
does your wife get to keep hers ?
renata ? i guess .
what are you saying ?
you &apos;ve been married going on ... ?
eight months . why ?
do your homework . i &apos;ll be right up .
no video games .
bye , kalinda .
you got a plate ?
a jesse raymond white , of darien .
no priors . is that anyone you know ?
that might not mean anything .
keep track if it &apos;s the same car tomorrow .
what did dylan say ?
about the suv ? nothing .
no . about ... anything .
he said i shouldn &apos;t be on my cell when i drive .
nothing else ?
not really .
he didn &apos;t say anything about the kids at school ?
yeah . someone named brian ,
who moved away .
did he say anything about mike zeiler ?
all american mike ?
yes .
what did he say ?
he just mentioned him .
part of your job , kalinda--
a big part--
is to tell me what dylan says .
you understand ?
i &apos;m not really a kid person , sir .
but maybe there is someone ...
no , no , no , there &apos;s nobody .
there &apos;s you .
mrs. florrick .
guy redmayne .
my daughter and , uh , aide @-@ de @-@ camp , crystal .
alicia florrick . thank you both so much for meeting me . i ...
sit . sit .
double vodka . oh , do you want a pick @-@ me @-@ up , mrs. florrick ?
oh , no , thank you . and it &apos;s alicia .
okay , alicia .
yeah .
now , i only have a few moments .
let &apos;s cut to the chase .
you want my money , huh ?
yes .
and let me tell you why i deserve it .
yeah ?
i will reduce the murder rate
by aggressively prosecuting gun crimes .
good . it &apos;s a big problem .
and ... because i also believe in
the swift administration of justice ...
i will make it a priority
to double the speed of our prosecutions .
you &apos;re good on substance ,
but family values--
it &apos;s critical to a guy like me .
how long have you been married ?
oh , um , 21 years .
ah , 38 for me . you know ,
till sylvia died of ovarian cancer .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we went through a lot ,
but we stayed together .
like you and your husband .
it speaks volumes .
so do you , um ...
always demand this kind of privacy ?
everywhere i go . i hate people .
i love mankind , but i hate people .
especially when they eat .
now , why don &apos;t you sit back down , alicia .
let me see those pretty legs of yours .
you are , uh , pretty fresh , aren &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s my best feature .
i got the testicles of a 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
where ? in your briefcase ?
you !
isn &apos;t she great , crystal ?
so , um ...
what do you think of my stance ?
well , i &apos;m going to support you , alicia .
yeah . one million in dark money .
thank you , mr. redmayne .
it &apos;s not because of your pretty face
or because you have the best eyes on a lawyer i &apos;ve ever seen .
well , then , why is it ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t like fags .
i heard the calls your campaign is making to the suburbs .
it &apos;s a smart way to use it .
um , well , actually , that @-@ that &apos;s not us .
that &apos;s our pac .
and i &apos;m not even sure if it is our pac ...
you hear about the two fags on safari ?
no , um , and just so you know , it &apos;s ...
mr. redmayne &apos;s married . i ... mr. prady &apos;s married .
yeah ?
or he ... he was married .
it &apos;s good meeting you , honey .
keep up the good work .
kick that fruitcake when he &apos;s down .
i love people who share my values .
welcome back , everyone .
ms. krause , you may call your next witness .
defense calls renata ellard @-@ sweeney .
your honor , the witness is the plaintiff &apos;s wife .
we move to exclude her on the basis
of marital communications privilege .
which covers only communications made
between spouses during marriage .
d @-@ darling .
oh , dear .
i think she &apos;s mad at me .
did your husband tell you
that he buried the gloves he wore when he murdered carolyn ?
objection . marital privilege .
did he tell you before you were married ?
yes .
overruled .
we had gone away for the weekend to calistoga .
we were having sex in a supply closet .
i told him he was bad ,
he said i didn &apos;t know how bad . so ...
i asked him to tell me .
did you have occasion to tell detective crowell
about these gloves ?
yes ,
that &apos;s how they got in the episode .
guess i should move those gloves .
i don &apos;t understand what the problem is .
the problem is you need to tell us
you were joking , mr. sweeney .
why ?
because if ...
if we know you killed carolyn ,
we can &apos;t elicit testimony from you that you didn &apos;t .
which means that your wife &apos;s accusations go unchallenged .
so were you joking , mr. sweeney ?
yes , of course i was joking .
but i do need to talk to alicia about something .
your colleagues worry that i might perjure myself
on the stand .
regarding what ?
whether i murdered dear carolyn .
now , speaking hypothetically , if i did perjure myself ,
could i be prosecuted ?
mr. sweeney ,
why can &apos;t you be having this discussion
with cary or diane ?
because your ethical compunctions are much more pronounced ,
which means i &apos;ll get a more considered answer .
one more likely to keep me out of trouble .
perjury prosecutions in civil cases are exceedingly rare .
good .
but given your profile ,
i think the s.a. would jump at the chance to nail you .
so you need to give yourself cover .
what , uh ...
show me .
mr. sweeney , did you kill your wife ?
absolutely not .
no . try this .
as i &apos;ve said on numerous occasions , i did not kill my wife .
ah , tricky , tricky , yes , yes . go on .
sometimes you can &apos;t sidestep ,
so you evade completely .
did you take drugs
the day carolyn disappeared ?
a sleeping pill .
which can impact memory .
so if you don &apos;t want to answer ,
say you were under the influence of prescription medication .
and i can &apos;t recall anything that happened that day .
yes .
mrs. florrick ,
whatever will i do without you ?
whoa , hold up , hold up . hey !
what are you gonna do , you little baby ?
lower your fist or i &apos;m gonna break your arm .
we were just ...
we &apos;re friends , right , dylan ?
you touch him again ,
and i &apos;ll be back .
now ... tell me you understand .
i understand .
don &apos;t tell my dad .
what ?
i said don &apos;t tell my dad .
about that kid ?
all american mike . don &apos;t tell him .
he &apos;ll just get angry .
you &apos;ll have a black eye .
i got it from tripping after school .
please . he &apos;ll do something .
he &apos;ll scare them .
dylan , i &apos;m gonna go a little bit faster here , okay ?
but don &apos;t worry , i ... i know what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m fine .
do you promise ?
where &apos;s your dad ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you want me to do ?
that &apos;s not what we talked about .
uh , dylan is home , sir .
all right , thank you .
what ?
i was very clear about how
i wanted this to go down and what i wanted .
you &apos;re not listening to me .
call it murder depicts your character as engaged
in a sexual practice called breath play , right ?
that &apos;s correct .
and did you engage in this practice with your late wife ?
not as often as i would &apos;ve liked .
so you would have liked to strangle carolyn more ?
what a crass way to put it .
i meant i miss my wife .
okay . as depicted in the show ,
you &apos;re also a practitioner of shibari , s and m and piquerism ,
all of which you engaged in with other partners .
uh , what &apos;s piquerism ?
deriving sexual satisfaction by stabbing or cutting your partner .
objection , this questioning is irrelevant
as to whether mr. sweeney killed his wife .
it &apos;s not about whether he killed his wife .
it &apos;s whether the overall portrayal
of mr. sweeney is accurate .
details of his sexual practices ...
are repugnant ,
but , in this instance , salient . overruled .
i won &apos;t apologize for my sexual proclivities , ms. krause .
i like to experiment .
the unexamined life , after all ...
yet each of these practices demonstrates a tendency
towards violence , wouldn &apos;t you agree ?
the genetic fact is that women respond to male domination .
and the role of the male is to dominate his mate ,
and to discipline her when she steps out of line .
it &apos;s biblical .
st . paul &quot; wives , submit to your husbands . &quot;
that &apos;s all i &apos;m here to do : dominate .
judge , plaintiff will stipulate that the
sexual practices depicted
uh , your honor ,
in the show are accurate .
the defense ...
i &apos;m sorry , the plaintiff ,
is merely trying to interrupt the ... - the defense is trying ...
hello , sir .
i need to see you right now .
about what ?
we &apos;ll discuss it when you get here .
guy redmayne .
frank prady .
thank you for meeting with me , uh ...
sit .
i , uh , i know you don &apos;t have much time ,
so let me just say , uh , your support ,
and the support of your pac , uh ,
would mean a lot to my campaign .
uh , together we can @-@ we can ...
well , full disclosure :
i already sat down with alicia florrick .
okay .
uh , well , that makes sense . mm @-@ hmm .
it &apos;s important to meet both candidates ,
and , uh , hear our , uh , our visions for the office .
i &apos;m thinking more about my vision .
did you see the ass on that broad ?
i &apos;m telling you , my eyes were popping out .
oh , uh , well , well , i @-@ i think the , uh ...
uh , the key difference in our approaches ...
i figure that she &apos;s a tigress in the sack , too , right ?
those buttoned @-@ up types almost always are .
let me @-@ let me start again .
give me an hour with her
and she wouldn &apos;t be walking straight for a week .
i &apos;d split that little missy in half .
what &apos;s wrong , mr. prady ?
you got an issue ?
uh , no , no , i wouldn &apos;t ...
i wouldn &apos;t exactly , uh , say an issue .
uh , more a ... a request .
yeah ?
mrs. florrick may be my opponent , but
i don &apos;t really need to denigrate her .
i &apos;m not talking about denigrating .
i &apos;m talking about banging that bitch
till she screams like a $ 5,000- a @-@ night whore .
okay . this was interesting .
you leaving ?
uh ... yeah ,
mr. redmayne , i don &apos;t know if this was , uh , some kind of test ,
but my issues with mrs. florrick
are all intellectual ,
not personal .
just as i thought .
just as i thought , crystal .
get the hell out of here .
you &apos;re disgusting .
right , but i &apos;m rich ,
so it really doesn &apos;t matter , does it ?
like i told you--
fag . big fag .
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
no .
we were just basking in the musk of each other &apos;s pheromones .
renata , could we have a moment ?
a moment . but then i need more .
so i see you &apos;ve made up .
yes .
with an additional two million
holding deal on her board seat .
i was genuinely moved by the depths to which
she would go to show i was neglecting her .
do you think you could be moved again in court ?
why ?
i hear you &apos;ve lost the judge .
maybe it &apos;s time to show him another side .
a sensitive side .
we were married for seven wonderful years .
and at the time of carolyn &apos;s disappearance ,
how would you describe the state of your marriage ?
we were deeply in love .
can you explain why , seven years after carolyn &apos;s death ,
a show like call it murder
would choose to portray you as a killer ?
i &apos;m notorious .
the white o.j.
and no matter what happens , people will believe the worst .
it &apos;s a good story .
i , uh , was acquitted .
i prevailed in a wrongful death suit .
there &apos;s someone now in prison for carolyn &apos;s murder .
her daughter .
and no one will allow me to be vindicated .
no one seems to consider how much i ...
... how much i miss her .
how much pain i still feel .
i know i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not a perfect man , but
i loved carolyn .
and they shouldn &apos;t be allowed to tell 15 million people
that i did this .
i &apos;m sorry .
dylan has a black eye .
i saw .
how did he get it ?
well , what did he tell you ?
he tripped while leaving school .
yeah , that &apos;s what he told me , too .
you know how hard it is to fall on your face ?
it &apos;s very hard .
because your arms instinctively shoot out to protect your head .
that &apos;s how you can tell when someone &apos;s a drunk .
but my son doesn &apos;t drink .
so what happened to my son ?
a bully hit him .
and you didn &apos;t think i needed to be made aware of this ?
look , i took care of it , sir .
i scared the kid off .
and what did this kid look like ?
mr. bishop , i really don &apos;t think ...
how hard is it to answer one simple question ? !
on the heavy side ?
maybe half a foot taller than my son .
dark hair ,
could use a comb .
mike zeiler ?
what are you going to do ?
you can go now .
look , there &apos;s no need to be ...
i said ... you can go .
mr. zeiler , it &apos;s dylan &apos;s dad .
do you have a minute ?
your son &apos;s been bullying my son .
yes , hitting him .
i @-@ i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t .
but you will speak to him ?
good . that &apos;s all i ask .
okay . good evening .
hardest thing i &apos;ve ever had to do .
be a parent .
do you want me to go , sir ?
my dad didn &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass about me .
he ran off when i was six .
i told myself i &apos;d never do that to dylan .
never .
he &apos;s the only thing i &apos;m proud of .
the only thing .
then this little nothing of a kid
makes his life hell .
not a mule from columbia ,
or a guatemalan assassin .
just a little kid , with his day trader parents .
what do i do with that ?
you did it .
i have to go .
hold it . hold it ! one at a time .
we renew our motion for a directed verdict .
the defendant has not carried its burden
of showing that mr. sweeney killed his wife .
but we have proven that the show &apos;s depiction
of mr. sweeney &apos;s alleged crime is littered with falsehoods .
we don &apos;t have to establish that all the particulars are true .
only that they are &quot; substantially true . &quot;
a circumstantial case with no eyewitnesses , judge .
even the show can &apos;t manufacture that .
yes , and if the standard were beyond a reasonable doubt ,
then i &apos;d be unconvinced .
but the standard is a preponderance of the evidence .
a low bar , which the defendant has met .
he denied your motion ?
yes . we have to put on our rebuttal tomorrow .
what &apos;s the strategy ?
well , as of now , we don &apos;t have one .
i &apos;ve been looking at the episode all afternoon .
i &apos;ll call you if i find something .
good . i &apos;ll do the same .
damn it .
you &apos;re my lawyer .
you have an obligation to zealously defend me .
which i will do
by making the prosecution prove its case .
not by falsifying evidence or by cheating .
fine , goody two @-@ shoes .
i &apos;ll tell you , debbie ,
when this is over ,
i just might fire you .
no , sir .
i &apos;m firing you .
because debbie conlon is not for sale .
diane , it &apos;s alicia .
i think we have a way to force them to settle .
here . here . here .
and ... here .
is there a point to this or are we just playing show @-@ and @-@ tell ?
five scenes from this episode display a monitor
that features the chumhum homepage .
and on every homepage we can make out chummie the gopher
who gets three minutes and 42 seconds of screen time .
so what ?
chummie is the registered trademark
of our billionaire client , chumhum .
you &apos;ve infringed on their trademark .
fair use .
nice try .
since when is trademark disparagement fair use ?
please . we didn &apos;t disparage anything .
um ... you think a jury will believe
that chummie being in multiple scenes with a psychotic killer
doesn &apos;t disparage mr. gross &apos;s brand ?
so , here &apos;s the thing .
this case is worth $ 50 million easy
and we &apos;ll come after every dollar .
or you can give mr. sweeney the public apology he deserves
by taking out ads in certain papers of record .
your choice .
time to die now .
i understand guy redmayne &apos;s pac
has decided to support you .
is this a back @-@ channel , frank ?
that &apos;s a big get .
a lot of money .
it could make the difference in your campaign .
you &apos;ve raised a lot of money , too .
i have .
he &apos;s quite a character , isn &apos;t he : redmayne ?
he is .
a bit provocative ?
i guess .
my campaign manager is angry .
why &apos;s that ?
he thinks redmayne was in my column
and then he wasn &apos;t .
after he spoke to you .
that happens .
yes , it does .
one argument is better than another , right ?
do you think this back @-@ channel
has overstayed its usefulness ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think campaigning is a lonely profession .
and the only one who shares that loneliness ...
is you .
we took down the robocall-- the pac did .
i noticed .
thank you .
hey , mom .
grace .
you okay ? you look unhappy .
no . just ...
nothing .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t like when people do bad things .
what people ?
clients .
yeah , well , everybody &apos;s bad in some way .
i was bad today .
no , mom , you weren &apos;t .
you can &apos;t be .
why ?
why can &apos;t i be ?
because you &apos;re the best person i know .
no ...
mom , shh .
shh , it &apos;s okay .
