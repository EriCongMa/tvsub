gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
she &apos;s not charlie rhodes .
she &apos;s ivy dickens .
she &apos;s a wannabe actress from florida .
you should go before we call the police .
i &apos;m not leaving town until i get what i deserve .
no one can touch me anymore .
i &apos;m a rhodes now .
maureen &apos;s cheating on trip .
there must be some mistake .
maureen &apos;s a devoted wife .
look , i get you have to run the story , just ...
i hope you don &apos;t let your personal feelings against me
make it any uglier than it has to be .
i &apos;ll admit that i saw the web page ,
but i had nothing to do with it coming out .
well , if you didn &apos;t do it , then who did ?
do you see those people leaving ? why don &apos;t you join them ?
it wasn &apos;t until i saw you confronting blair
that i realized i had it all wrong .
you &apos;re in love with her .
i &apos;m not in love with blair .
you &apos;ve really been good this whole time , haven &apos;t you ?
i wanted to move on to give you the happy life you deserve .
i only turned dark and desperate
because i was afraid of losing you .
apologies have been made and the security breach fixed .
but two weeks later , and still not one tip .
apparently , no one can hold a grudge
like an upper east sider ...
and no one can lie like one , either .
here &apos;s to charlie ,
who &apos;s learning it &apos;s never too late to be a debutante ,
and to mom , who couldn &apos;t refuse one last ball .
oh ! it &apos;s not a ball . it &apos;s just a little party
to introduce my darling niece into society .
just because carol made a mockery of her own debut does not
mean that charlie should be cheated out of the experience .
yeah , she hired karen finley to go in her place ,
and when carol &apos;s name was called ,
karen walks out wearing nothing
but chocolate and a pillbox hat .
now i &apos;m a karen finley fan ,
but it was a bit much .
we were barred from the plaza for years .
well ... i &apos;m honored .
and if the party wasn &apos;t enough , lily arranged for me
to spend the day at the plaza athenee spa .
it &apos;s way too generous ,
especially after everything i put you guys through with max .
oh , please . that was not your fault .
that young man had a lot of problems .
no wonder serena was so into him .
anyway , i &apos;m just eager to put this all behind me
and start a new chapter in my life .
oh , and , um , i got a job to help .
nate offered me my old position back .
waffles , a new job ,
and a party in your honor ?
not a bad day to be charlie rhodes .
not a bad day to be dan humphrey either .
it seems like being the target of a twitter war pays off .
&quot; inside &quot; is doing so well
that simon &amp; schuster is giving it a second printing .
yeah , my editor wants to-- to publish it with a--
a new afterword now .
so i @-@ i @-@ i have no idea what to write .
i &apos;m starting to understand
the appeal of heroin or womanizing
or--or whatever it is writers do when they can &apos;t write .
it &apos;s hard to find inspiration
when you &apos;re not trashing your friends , huh ?
well , at least i don &apos;t have the added pressure
of it being turned into a movie , so thank you for that .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
you two should not be fighting like this .
it &apos;s time to work it out .
yeah , i &apos;m coming into the office now ,
but you gotta cancel that meeting with bloomberg .
there &apos;s just too much going on today .
yeah , sounds good . thank you .
a week ago , you couldn &apos;t get bloomberg to give you a quote
to &quot; the spectator . &quot; now you &apos;re canceling on him ?
that &apos;s a bold move , nathaniel .
i &apos;m almost aroused .
yeah , well , ever since i published that article
about staying independent from my family ,
people are paying attention .
so you &apos;re finally learning
there are upsides to pissing off your family .
grandfather actually loved the editorial ,
so much so that he invited me to be his guest
at camp allen this weekend .
i leave for vermont after work .
yeah , you , warren buffet ,
and every other finance and media titan .
world domination by day , debauchery by night .
the allen retreat is legendary .
i pity the fool who tries to hire a call girl
in manhattan this weekend .
yeah . so i have to ask you ,
why are you reading a rival paper , huh ?
布莱尔近几周都没有和王子见面
they might call the wedding off ?
does this--does this mean that--that you ...
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not even true .
you should know better than anyone
these stories are invented to sell papers
to women who collect ceramic cats .
yeah , still , maybe you should give her a call .
louis is the father of her child .
there &apos;s no way blair &apos;s walking away from that .
same thing happening to me .
pregnancy makes fingers swell up like kielbasas .
well , the paparazzi aren &apos;t camped out downstairs
to find out if your wedding is called off .
they see me without my ring ,
they &apos;ll think it means something .
i start to think maybe it does .
mr. louis is back from third world .
it &apos;s been a week , and he is still waiting at the consulate--
where he &apos;ll remain until i decide what to do .
you know what to do .
mr. chuck told you secret to making louis good man again .
say like magic spell--
&quot; bibbidi @-@ bobbidi @-@ boo , i will never leave you &quot;
poof !
louis will feel safe again ,
and you live happily ever after .
but i &apos;m not sure i can promise louis
that i &apos;ll never leave him .
handsome prince who is father of your child loves you .
what is stopping you ?
nothing ! but unlike you ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t just marry the first person who asks me .
it is the thought of mr. chuck that makes you unsure .
of course not !
well , i will admit that chuck has changed ,
but this is about louis ,
and until i can promise him he &apos;ll never lose me ,
or my fingers regain their elegant shape ,
we are not leaving this apartment .
that could be very long time .
we are going nowhere .
this is new york . we can live on takeout for months .
i &apos;m sorry i assumed
you were trying to sabotage my book being made into a movie .
i &apos;m sorry , too , that it didn &apos;t work out .
i really did wanna make it happen for you , dan .
but that &apos;s--that &apos;s great about the second print of &quot; inside . &quot;
you &apos;ll be able to figure out the afterword .
i &apos;m not so sure , though .
i @-@ i &apos;ve never been stuck like this before .
what ? it seems like an amazing opportunity
to see how the book changed you , how--how it changed everyone .
did it really change anyone ?
yes !
seeing where our characters ended made us realize
exactly where we didn &apos;t want to be .
nate didn &apos;t want to be half a person ,
and now he &apos;s running &quot; the spectator . &quot;
and chuck went from dying alone to therapy .
what about you ?
well , i thought i changed my ending
by getting the job with jane or this blog , but ...
the truth is , i &apos;m still making
horrible decisions in my love life .
i actually envy you .
you get this book where you get to see your journey
and see what choices you would make differently ,
where you went off track .
i wish i had something like that .
well , if you really are looking for
a history of serena van der woodsen ,
there &apos;s always &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i know , i know , i know , but it &apos;s not like
she hasn &apos;t chronicled your entire life since grammar school .
what harm could it be to look at a few old blasts ?
i think maybe you &apos;d learn something you didn &apos;t expect .
um , charlie &apos;s leaving and needs her coat .
okay . i &apos;ll bring it to her .
thank you , dan . good luck .
how &apos;d it go ?
well , serena just pointed out
how the ending of my book changed ...
everyone except me , of course .
well , it &apos;s not too late to change .
how ?
writing @-@ wise ? life @-@ wise ?
i wouldn &apos;t know where to begin .
well ...
for starters ...
blair ?
i &apos;m very observant .
and not to mention , you haven &apos;t really dated anyone
since that kiss with blair last spring .
blair &apos;s getting married and having a baby with louis .
and if she wasn &apos;t with louis ,
she &apos;d be with chuck , not me .
maybe .
even if blair doesn &apos;t feel the same way ,
it might be worth it for you to tell her how you feel .
at least so you can move on .
i think the last time i saw you concentrating that hard ,
you were reading the instructions on how to assemble a hookah .
trip ! hey , man . what are you doing here ?
i had a meeting across the street ,
figured i &apos;d stop in and say hey .
but , uh , i &apos;ll let you get back to it .
we &apos;re still on for racquetball tomorrow ?
oh , actually , grandfather &apos;s taking me out
to the allen retreat tonight .
yeah . i thought you knew .
no . i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sure it was just , you know ,
a last @-@ minute decision and everything .
i &apos;m sorry he can &apos;t bring both of us .
actually , it &apos;s okay .
no , the reason he asked you is because i backed out .
truth is , i couldn &apos;t stand to be around him right about now .
well ... why ? what happened ?
well , maureen and i have been having some issues
since she tried to release the fake affair story .
but something wasn &apos;t adding up .
she finally admitted
that grandfather was behind the whole thing .
what ? why didn &apos;t she say something before ?
it was causing a tremendous strain on our marriage ,
and she got scared .
he made her do it .
and just because he said it was to help my campaign ,
it doesn &apos;t make it okay .
no , of course not .
anyway , i &apos;m sorry to burden you with this .
maybe it &apos;s better for you to know now ,
before you go away with him
because ...
he manipulated you , too .
dvd on prenatal yoga .
maybe we use this time to get in shape for childbirth .
i plan on having my child the old @-@ fashioned way--
fully sedated . and the only downward dog ...
i wanna see you doing
is cleaning up the dust from under that couch .
please .
i &apos;m not even safe in my own home !
i have to get out of here !
somewhere they &apos;d never think to look for me ...
we go to dorota &apos;s in queens !
princesses don &apos;t go to queens .
need to marry louis to be princess .
hello .
i guess it &apos;s time for me to accept
that if you want something badly enough ,
you just have to go out and get it yourself .
hey , i was wondering what you were doing today .
coming to stay with you , actually .
uh ... okay .
watch out , kids .
the end of me
just might turn out to be the end of one of you .
the sheets you brought are on the bed ,
your jo malone candles are burning in every room ,
and every trace of my existence
has been removed from the bathroom .
thank you . just because i had to flee to the boroughs
doesn &apos;t mean my creme de la mer should have to suffer , too .
i saw your photo in the paper . is--is everything okay ?
everything is horrible .
i need to go to louis and reassure him
that he &apos;s never gonna lose me , but something is stopping me .
chuck is stopping you .
no . i haven &apos;t even spoken to chuck .
you don &apos;t have to . you two have
some strange force field effect on each other .
physicists should study it .
fine .
though the last thing you deserve is to hear these words--
you &apos;re right .
chuck has finally become
the person i &apos;ve always wanted him to be ,
and i know how to change the louis
back into the prince i fell in love with ,
which means i &apos;m trapped .
i have to choose , but i can &apos;t . you have to help me .
have you made a list of pros and cons ?
sometimes that helps me .
lists are for choosing bridesmaids ,
not who you &apos;re spending the rest of your life with .
you &apos;re right . go the howard hughes route .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll figure it out by the time you &apos;re peeing in jars .
fine .
okay , i &apos;ll start with chuck .
pros--he truly has become a good man .
cons--he &apos;s slept with every woman in new york .
it could get a little awkward at dinner parties .
sometimes fun . don &apos;t judge .
okay , louis . pros--obviously , he &apos;s a prince .
of monaco . what else ?
he &apos;s the father of my child .
the fact is ...
i can make all the lists in the world ,
but what else matters ?
i &apos;ve pretended like it &apos;s not a factor ,
but it &apos;s everything .
isn &apos;t it ?
louis is the father of my child ,
so ... he is the only ending to this fairy tale .
right ?
he--he doesn &apos;t have to be .
you don &apos;t think it would matter
that my baby is another man &apos;s child ?
it wouldn &apos;t to me .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re right .
i at least have to ask .
uh , can you do me a favor and go grab us some food ?
i &apos;m famished .
ma &apos;am .
this better be a long @-@ distance call .
i told you . i &apos;m not leaving until i get my money .
look , i offered you some cash to help you get back home ,
and you said no .
$ 5,000 ?
what good is that ?
i gave up everything for you .
either you give me the full amount you promised ,
or i will tell anyone who will listen who you really are .
go ahead and try .
if my family didn &apos;t believe you , who will ?
what are you working on so intently over there ?
i &apos;m going through old &quot; gossip girl &quot; blasts ,
trying to figure out
when i started making such bad romantic decisions .
it &apos;s ... a trip--
which is also the name of one of my disastrous choices .
not all bad , i hope .
no . no , i &apos;m up to , uh , junior year ,
and there &apos;s a lot of stuff about me and dan , which is good .
oh , my gosh .
do you remember our first official date ,
when he took me to jean georges to try to impress me ?
i do . yeah , he was so nervous ,
i considered slipping him a tranquilizer .
we had fun . mm .
you know , the truth is ,
i don &apos;t think i ever got it right before dan ...
or--or since him .
besides nate ,
he &apos;s probably the only good guy i &apos;ve ever dated .
i can &apos;t disagree . and you guys were great together .
i don &apos;t think i realized how great at the time .
well , i think it &apos;s really something
how those feelings turned into such an enduring friendship .
yeah . yeah , sure . of course .
hmm . that &apos;s weird . a &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast .
yeah , i &apos;ve noticed
you guys haven &apos;t gotten a lot of those lately .
everyone &apos;s been afraid to send in tips
since their identities were revealed .
&quot; since no one will dare to send in a scoop ,
i had to do by own stakeout ,
and my hard work paid off .
spotted--
possible royal runaway bride blair waldorf
being offered refuge at lonely boy &apos;s loft .
looks like brooklyn fools rush in . &quot;
mm , i guess dan got the ending he wanted .
good for him .
hello , blair .
i need your advice .
it seems as you &apos;ve found your way , i &apos;ve lost mine .
i didn &apos;t think blair waldorf could get lost .
neither did i , but ...
i &apos;m so lost , i wound up in brooklyn .
well , there are worse places .
this isn &apos;t something humphrey could help you with ?
no . only you .
do you think you could love another man &apos;s child ?
why are you asking me this ?
i &apos;m ... paralyzed .
i ... can &apos;t move . i can &apos;t breathe .
you have to help me .
i can &apos;t make this decision for you , blair .
you &apos;re the one who has to live with it .
but ...
what &apos;s the right choice , chuck ?
i can &apos;t imagine
it would be a mistake to marry the father of your child . right ?
so the fake story maureen told about the affair--
did she do that on her own , or were you involved ?
it was my idea .
i thought it would help trip . obviously , it was a mistake .
i was planning on telling you about maureen this weekend ,
but you beat me to it .
and since we &apos;re having this conversation ,
there &apos;s something else i was gonna tell you .
it wasn &apos;t a coincidence that diana hired you .
she did so at my request .
wait . what ?
w @-@ why would you do that ?
the whole reason i came to work here
was because i didn &apos;t want to get a job through my family .
i wanted to prove myself .
and you did .
i was worried for your future , nathaniel .
i thought you might enjoy working in journalism .
and in all honesty ,
i hoped i could control some of the press about trip .
yeah , but why--why are you coming clean now ?
that editorial that you published-
it made me realize
you &apos;re the one who has an understanding of
which direction the van der bilt family needs to go in
if we &apos;re gonna continue to be leaders .
not trip .
no . not anymore .
i should let you get back to work .
i know this is a lot to take in ,
but i hope you will still be my guest
at camp allen this weekend .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m assuming trip is the one who told you about maureen .
i &apos;m sorry he said anything before i was able to .
he &apos;s always wanted me to take him to camp allen .
he was pretty upset when i invited you over him .
so you never asked trip to go ?
no .
trip &apos;s scared he &apos;s gonna lose the election ,
and i think it &apos;s beginning to make him a little desperate .
i &apos;m gonna head over there , have a little talk with him .
please , um , let me know
if you change your mind about the weekend .
nate ?
uh , max harding , ivy &apos;s ...
what do you want ?
there &apos;s something you need to know about charlie .
yeah , that you accused her of being an imposter ?
serena and charlie already told me .
let me guess . you &apos;re here
because you want me to buy your story .
it &apos;s worth it .
yeah , well , what makes you think
that i &apos;d believe anything that you had to say ?
she &apos;s not who she says she is , nate .
hey , serena , the loft is surrounded by paparazzi .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s insane .
well , they &apos;re probably tracking &quot; gossip girl &quot;
who &apos;s tracking blair to your door .
look , i know why you invited her there ,
and i think it &apos;s a huge mistake .
she and louis may be having problems ,
but they &apos;re still engaged .
and then there &apos;s chuck .
dan , this is not the time to be throwing your hat into the ring .
why do you care ?
because unlike you , i have her best interests at heart .
telling her your feelings is not gonna change your ending .
it &apos;s just gonna mess with hers .
well , listen , the fact is ,
this doesn &apos;t concern you at all .
i &apos;m gonna talk to blair .
and even if it &apos;s the biggest kamikaze disaster of my life ,
it &apos;s my disaster . it &apos;s my ending .
so--so--so please , stay out of it .
fine . then i may just help someone else get their ending .
go ahead , serena .
they say love is blind ,
but jealousy , it seems ,
provides a clear view all the way to monaco .
hey !
oh , i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
i was just leaving and i wanted to say hi .
no . please , come in .
you &apos;re the first friendly face i &apos;ve seen all day .
that bad , huh ?
yeah . yeah , today ...
yeah . hey , listen , i have to tell you ,
your , uh , ex max came by to see me earlier .
he &apos;s trying to sell your story .
what did he say to you ?
oh , he was looking for money .
he seemed pretty desperate , though .
i kicked him out , but i thought you should know .
just ... be careful .
thanks .
i will .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re not gonna be able
to make it to my party tonight .
oh , well , actually , i might be able to now .
my grandfather just admitted to me
that the only reason i have this job
is because he bought &quot; the spectator . &quot;
and here i was ,
thinking i was doing great work and so proud of it ,
and now i just feel like a total ... fraud .
look , it doesn &apos;t matter how you got here ,
nate .
once you started the job , you did the work .
i read that editorial you wrote , and it &apos;s clear
that you &apos;ve become the leader that you wanted to be .
if you deserve to be that person ,
then own it and never look back .
thanks .
thank you for letting me use the suite to set up .
it &apos;s made things so much easier .
i hope we &apos;ll see you later .
as a public service , i &apos;m staying home this evening .
i see .
well , for what it &apos;s worth , blair won &apos;t be attending .
blair &apos;s schedule is of no interest to me .
look , i don &apos;t mean to pry , charles .
but i have been worried about you
as her wedding date approaches . it can &apos;t be easy .
thank you for your concern , but i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s nothing that can &apos;t be fixed with a night of scotch
and perhaps a rogue socialite ,
if you care to send one my way .
well , if you find that that falls short ,
i &apos;m always here for you .
no matter how ugly or dark your feelings may be ,
you should not have to bear them alone .
i appreciate it , lily ,
but you have no idea what you &apos;d be taking on .
are you kidding ? of course i do .
try as you might , you don &apos;t scare me .
i &apos;m sorry to inform you
that my love for you is unconditional .
the idea of unconditional love
is as quaint as the tooth fairy
or environmentally friendly dry cleaning .
no , no , not when you &apos;re a parent .
look , you might only be my son by marriage , charles ,
but i &apos;ve always loved you as my own ,
and i hope you get the opportunity
to feel that kind of love with someone someday .
i haven &apos;t heard from her in weeks .
i &apos;m going out of my mind .
well , maybe i can help you .
why ?
i thought after what happened at the shower ,
you would want me as far away from blair as possible .
it &apos;s not for you . it &apos;s for her .
i just want blair to be happy
and all of her dreams to come true .
and ... i believe you &apos;re the one that can do that for her .
but you have to promise me-- no more scheming .
of course . i realize now how wrong i was .
i &apos;m not looking at the gossip sites .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not reading the newspapers .
i just want blair back .
but i can &apos;t tell her this .
i don &apos;t even know where she is .
i do .
it &apos;s decided .
chuck ?
no .
apparently , there are some risks
even chuck bass isn &apos;t willing to take .
so ...
problem solved .
congratulations ?
i &apos;m not crying .
you smell like onions .
blair , what if ...
you don &apos;t marry louis ?
and what ?
be alone ?
no .
what do you really want ?
to be happy .
but i don &apos;t think i know how to anymore .
i @-@ i think i know how to make you happy .
i spoke with nathaniel .
he told me about your visit .
how dare you try to undermine my relationship
with my grandson ?
what did you expect ?
i &apos;d give up everything without a fight
just because you decided nate was the future of this family ?
you &apos;ve been the engine behind my entire career .
and that can only last for so long .
the voters are not behind you .
yeah , and you can change that and you know it .
if you abandon me now , i &apos;ll lose the election .
i &apos;ll have nothing .
my mind &apos;s made up .
nate called to confirm he &apos;s coming with me this weekend .
plans have all been arranged .
time to get on board .
congressman ?
i think we can help each other .
uh , i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
someone who &apos;s sick of being pushed around by these people .
what are you doing here ?
apparently , the same as you .
the prince and the pill popper .
this should be fun . shall we ?
no one &apos;s answering .
the man can &apos;t hold his liquor or his narcotics .
the last time he tried to crash at my place ,
i learned where he hid his spare key .
sorry , boys , but didn &apos;t you know
that if you wait too long to seize the day ...
gone .
where would she go ?
the one you want can get away ?
there she is . charlie , this is matthew lynch .
he &apos;s covering the party for &quot; women &apos;s wear daily . &quot;
you look fantastic . who are you wearing ?
oh , thank you . badgley mischka .
it &apos;s great .
shall we go get ourselves a drink ?
enjoy your night .
thanks .
thank you so much .
this party is a dream come true .
i ... just can &apos;t believe that you would do all of this for me .
oh , my darling , you are family .
this is what we do for family .
take this polyester rag off my face right now , humphrey !
and who doesn &apos;t keep a silk blindfold
in their bedside table ?
you brought me to watch a human sacrifice ,
or an episode of &quot; the bachelor . &quot;
either way , i am not happy .
would you relax ? you are totally safe ,
and the paparazzi have no idea where you are .
we took the service elevator out of my apartment .
so ... i &apos;ll be right back .
no , no !
you are not going anywhere until you tell me what &apos;s going on .
would you trust me ?
i &apos;m not in the habit of doing that .
well , you don &apos;t really have a choice now , do you ?
just pull around to the garage .
evening , sir . welcome .
thank you .
what the hell are you doing here ?
thought i &apos;d check out charlie &apos;s party for myself .
yeah ? you leave her alone .
hey , look , just &apos; cause you &apos;re not interested in my story
doesn &apos;t mean someone else won &apos;t be .
i heard there are reporters here tonight .
a society princess exposed as a white trash fraud ?
sounds pretty compelling to me .
yeah , well , i guess i &apos;ll have to make sure
no one lets you in the door .
charlie , hey .
nate . i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be here .
yeah , i can &apos;t stay .
but listen , i just wanna give you a heads @-@ up .
max is here , and he just told me
he &apos;s gonna try and sell his story
to one of the reporters covering your party .
yeah , but it &apos;s all lies .
and you don &apos;t think anyone would believe him , right ?
yeah , but a story a story .
i mean , true or false , it can take on a life of its own .
really ? she wasn &apos;t at dan &apos;s ?
okay , i &apos;ll find out where she is . i promise , louis . bye .
hey , have either of you seen blair or dan ?
there &apos;s dan .
listen , humphrey , i don &apos;t wanna play hide @-@ and @-@ seek right now .
just tell me where the hell blair is .
what &apos;s he doing ?
looks like he &apos;s helping chuck and blair finally be together .
would you guys excuse me ? i &apos;m gonna go have a drink .
well , i hope the paparazzi don &apos;t know blair &apos;s here .
they &apos;ll try to storm the empire and ruin the whole party
just trying to get a photo .
seriously ? the paparazzi could shut down the party ?
especially if they knew blair was here with chuck .
i &apos;ll go talk to security about max .
what &apos;s going on ?
did you have something to do with this ?
no . dan arranged it for us .
what &quot; us &quot; ?
the &quot; us &quot; i should have fought for when you called .
the &quot; us &quot; that is not just you and me ,
but you , me , and your baby .
then ...
w @-@ why did you tell me to choose louis ?
i thought it was selfish if i was the one to tell you
to break up your family .
that was the moment you chose not to be selfish ?
well , timing has never been our strong suit .
i had it all wrong .
just because louis is the father of your baby
does not mean you should be with him .
you should be with me .
why ?
because i &apos;m going to love your baby as much as i love you .
what is it ?
&quot; gossip girl &quot;
someone sent out a blast that i &apos;m here ... with you .
i don &apos;t want any photos of us to get back to louis
before i can talk to him . i gotta get out of here .
wait .
i wanna come with you .
hey , sorry to bother you guys .
just wanted to make sure you saw the &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast .
we need to leave immediately .
yeah , i have a car here waiting for me .
so do i.
all right , perfect . then they &apos;ll be down in the garage .
we can go through there . come on .
i &apos;d like to have everyone &apos;s attention , please .
wow . the paparazzi are aggressive tonight .
they must really want a shot of our new &quot; it &quot; girl .
i &apos;d like to say a few words about my lovely niece
charlotte rhodes .
since she didn &apos;t grow up in new york city ,
you haven &apos;t had the opportunity
to know what a wonderful young woman she is .
i hope , starting tonight , you get that chance .
charlie ?
took you long enough ,
and i &apos;m not talking about the walk from the lobby to here .
have a good trip , nathaniel .
camus said that life is the sum of our choices .
choose wisely , and fortune smiles upon you .
but choose poorly ?
you never know what price you &apos;ll have to pay .
you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m okay adjacent .
i &apos;m sorry i came down so hard on you before .
eh , you were right .
i was gonna tell blair how i felt about her .
you mean you were gonna tell her you love her ?
in spite of myself-- and honestly , many times--
in spite of her .
i @-@ i mean , i didn &apos;t want to .
i kept trying to make it go away ,
but how do you kill a feeling ?
i don &apos;t know .
when you told me about the idea
of rewriting the end of my story ,
i thought , maybe ...
maybe that &apos;s the answer .
then what stopped you ?
when i saw blair ,
she &apos;d just gotten off the phone with chuck
and she was heartbroken .
you know , i &apos;ve been so consumed with my own feelings ,
i wouldn &apos;t let myself see how much she loves chuck .
you were right .
she didn &apos;t need my confession . she needed my help .
wow , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s a really amazing thing to do , dan .
yeah , well , i mean ...
it wasn &apos;t easy .
but i do think , uh ,
that i can give myself a new ending
by making sure chuck and blair get the ending they deserve .
i want her to be happy .
gotta head home and get started on this afterword .
dan ...
you &apos;re one of the good ones , you know ?
thanks .
you have fun at your party ?
when are you gonna leave me alone ?
starting now , actually .
i got some money , going back to portland .
good .
you think once i &apos;m gone , you &apos;re free .
the truth is , once i go , ivy ,
you are trapped in this lie forever .
look , i worked hard to get here .
trust me . i couldn &apos;t be happier .
yeah , maybe for now .
that &apos;ll wear off eventually .
no actress wants to play the same role her entire life .
this is more than just a role .
this is my life now ,
and these people are my family .
how can their love be real
when you &apos;re a total fake ?
whoa . are those paparazzi ?
yeah . they &apos;re chasing the car in front of us .
pretty aggressive .
yeah . i think they &apos;re chasing my friends .
i have to tell louis face @-@ to @-@ face
that the wedding is off .
he--he deserves at least that .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
i mean , a @-@ a prince , a fairy tale wedding .
this is all you ever wanted .
no .
you &apos;re all i ever wanted .
i love you .
i love every part of you .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t tell louis that he would never lose me
because it wasn &apos;t true .
you &apos;re the one i never want to leave .
okay , h @-@ how--how do you want to do this ?
first , we have to go to the consulate
so i can tell louis it &apos;s off , and then ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . we--we could go anywhere .
switzerland has impeccable schools
or maybe tokyo ?
they have opening ceremony and great test scores .
blair , blair , we don &apos;t need to go anywhere .
we can raise this baby right here .
look at them .
hey , grandfather .
yeah , well , i was a little delayed leaving the empire ,
but i &apos;m on my way to westchester airport now .
westchester ?
i thought i was taking you to the upper east side .
what ? no . no , no , no . hey . hey , c--let me call you back .
what ? no . i @-@ i have a flight out of westchester county airport
in 45 minutes .
okay . i just gotta get out of the park
and then i can turn around . it &apos;s not a problem .
all right . thank you .
those motorcycles are really out of control .
what the hell are they doing ?
oh , my god !
nate , i got your messages .
are chuck and blair okay ?
i don &apos;t know , but i saw the whole thing .
i stayed with them until the ambulances came .
they &apos;re with the doctors now .
i spoke with the e.m.t. who brought them in .
he said it &apos;s pretty bad .
okay .
okay .
eleanor , cyrus , harold , and roman
are all flying in on the next flight from paris .
eleanor was distraught .
serena texted me .
are blair and chuck all right ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
we &apos;re hoping for the best .
i &apos;m gonna go track down the doctor
and see if i can get an update .
this is all gossip girl &apos;s fault .
if she hadn &apos;t sent out that blast ...
well , i &apos;m not trying to defend her ,
but it &apos;s not like gossip girl hopped on a motorcycle
and chased chuck and blair through the streets of manhattan .
well , she may as well have .
if gossip girl didn &apos;t exist ,
chuck and blair would not be in the hospital right now ,
fighting for their lives .
you know , i spent the whole morning looking at old blasts ,
and it &apos;s unbelievable the amount of pain she &apos;s caused .
this is just the culmination of years of damage .
all right , so what do you want to do ?
well , i wanna finish what diana started .
i wanna take gossip girl down for good .
i &apos;m with you ,
and i think we should use &quot; the spectator &quot; to do it .
charlie ...
are you okay ?
no .
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not .
this is all my fault .
what are you talking about ? of course it &apos;s not .
i sent the &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast .
why ?
i didn &apos;t do it to hurt blair .
i was just trying to protect myself .
from what ?
max showed up tonight .
he was threatening to sell my story
to the reporters covering the party .
and i thought that if i sent the blast ,
then the paparazzi would show up
and would crash the party and it &apos;d be shut down
before max could do any damage .
but what damage could he do ?
max is a complete fraud .
rufus , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s me . i &apos;m the fraud .
i just spoke to the doctor , and , um ,
the good news is that ...
blair is awake and responsive .
and chuck ?
carol , it &apos;s me , ivy .
i gotta get out of here .
i &apos;m leaving tonight .
this time , i &apos;m not coming back .
we all like to think
that we &apos;re in the driver &apos;s seat of our own lives .
but the truth is ,
the idea that we can control our fate is an illusion .
you can choose the most loyal friends ,
the dream job ...
the truest love .
there &apos;s been an accident .
how bad ?
you know i wouldn &apos;t take a risk like this if it wasn &apos;t serious .
i had no choice .
okay , jack . i &apos;ll get on the next plane .
you &apos;ll meet us there ?
of course . thank you , diana .
it &apos;s not me you should thank .
but at the end of the day , out fate is decided for us .
all we can do is hope we have the strength to cope
with the hands she deals us .
