it &apos;s sara harvey . she &apos;s dead .
em saw something on jenna &apos;s laptop
that can link back to a.d.
the case is officially closed .
tell me what to do ?
you obviously can &apos;t tell ezra .
what good would it do ?
i &apos;ll delete the call .
mrs. grunwald .
she &apos;s a psychic . a real psychic .
and she seems to like us in some disturbing creepy sort of way .
bye , caleb .
bye .
maybe we could just skip the headache and elope .
布置
i &apos;m callin &apos; again for dr. cochran .
it &apos;s noel kahn .
tell her i &apos;m running out of time and patience .
mary had a second child .
so charlotte had a biological brother or sister .
i &apos;m agent lee from the federal bureau of investigation .
you were involved with nicole gordon . correct ?
yes , i was .
we have reason to believe that she may be alive .
okay , so we know that noel kahn stole
the mary drake file from toby &apos;s airstream .
how &apos;s yvonne doing ?
she &apos;s , she &apos;s okay .
toby &apos;s gonna spend some time with her .
and then right after he got that file , he called dr. cochran .
sounds like jenna and noel are on the same path that we are .
only they &apos;re ahead of us .
but who burned us out of the storm cellar ?
somebody who didn &apos;t want us to know
that mary drake had a second child .
a.d. ?
noel kahn .
you guys , noel &apos;s been in the middle
of everything that &apos;s been happening to us .
he clearly has more a @-@ ness than anyone else out there .
i wouldn &apos;t have put it that way , hanna .
hold on , ali , you know noel better than any of us .
i &apos;m not proud to say it , but you &apos;re probably right .
i trusted him once , but then i realized
he was spying on me for charlotte .
but you had something on him ? i mean , from years ago .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
must have been good .
do you remember that frat party
i took you guys to , freshman year ?
we made those fake ids .
yeah , all the guys were super drunk . so ?
sorority girl fell down the stairs .
oh , my god .
she didn &apos;t fall . noel pushed her .
see , no story with noel kahn in it has a happy ending .
what if you went to noel now ?
threatened to go to the police or ..
no , it &apos;s too late .
his family paid the girl off years ago .
he got away with it .
yeah , like he does with everything .
exactly why we shouldn &apos;t be arguing whether noel &apos;s a
a.d. , uber a or whatever .
god , i can &apos;t believe you guys .
hey .
don &apos;t .
when are they gonna realize that noel kahn
is the one that we &apos;re after ?
they just wanna be certain , okay ?
mary and jenna are still out there .
oh , come on . how much more proof do we need
than the words &quot; i see you &quot; being written on our car
outside of the storm cellar ?
those were the exact words
written on ezra &apos;s car at camp mona .
i know , okay ? i get it . it &apos;s just that--
you don &apos;t believe me either .
look , we have to be completely
positive before we do anything rash .
well , i am .
and by now , if you &apos;re not ,
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna change your mind .
hanna .
hanna , look out !
so you &apos;re fine ?
really fine ?
i &apos;m fine .
really ?
fine .
so , um , how &apos;s it going over here ?
well , not that great . i mean , i &apos;m going over all the material
that you and spencer took photos of from the lock box
but everything except for mary &apos;s dna
is in some code that i can &apos;t crack .
yet , right ?
i &apos;m doing my best .
why dna ?
your guess is as good as mine .
what has mary been up to ?
there &apos;s no sign of her , at alison &apos;s or the lost woods .
what about jenna ?
any tapping around we need to be worried about ?
no , she hasn &apos;t left her room .
i guess noel &apos;s taken a leave while jenna practices her flute .
hey , um , speaking of noel , give me your phone .
what &apos;s that ?
this is your new phone .
it &apos;s 100 % bug free .
i have some for the rest of you guys too .
you can &apos;t be too careful with noel and jenna on the prowl .
really ? i hate breaking in new phones .
well , noel &apos;s found his way into your dreams .
that &apos;s close enough .
i mean , i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m surprised .
i did this to myself . i deleted that call from ezra &apos;s phone
and now it &apos;s coming back , and it &apos;s gonna bite me ...
aria , take a deep breath .
it &apos;s been proven to prevent explosions in small women .
ezra &apos;s with the authorities right now .
nicole could be alive , emily .
first off , you can &apos;t root for her not to be alive .
no . no , of course not .
and @-@ and second , you deleted the call for all the right reasons .
you were tryin &apos; to spare ezra .
i lied to him , emily .
lied to me about what ?
there was a call on your phone .
it said that it was from nicole , so i picked it up
and @-@ and no one answered , so i deleted it .
you what ?
it didn &apos;t make sense , ezra .
and i didn &apos;t wanna get your hopes up .
okay . okay .
ezra .
well , uh , guess what ?
one of the trucks in the aid convoy that nicole was with
was spotted near a rebel compound or
or something in colombia , so ...
have they found her ?
well , the military &apos;s , uh , going into the jungle
in about two hours , and they don &apos;t know
what they &apos;re gonna find .
i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah , me too .
okay , um , i think i &apos;m gonna leave .
um , yeah , i guess i &apos;ll go too .
i was just gonna shower , and then i &apos;m gonna head back .
yeah . yeah , that makes sense .
um , i &apos;ll see you .
so has ezra heard anything else ?
has he called aria ?
no .
aria &apos;s going crazy waiting . obviously , he is too .
yeah .
well , i guess it &apos;s a big day for all of us .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m going back to rosewood high school today .
back to teaching my class .
today ?
i , i know you &apos;ve talked about it
but do you really think now is the time ?
i mean , are you even ready ?
well , the welby social worker and dr. sullivan
gave me a clean bill of health .
that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s been less than two weeks
since archer dunhill ...
stole all my money .
look , em , i &apos;m broke . i have nothing .
and unless jason comes back from meeting
with his forensic accountant in philadelphia
with a truckload of cash , i , i honestly have no choice .
it &apos;s 20 minutes to the first bell . i should go .
wish me luck .
you &apos;ll be great .
is everything okay ?
yeah , i think so .
i took the liberty of ..
how &apos;s alison doing ?
better than can be expected .
well , she &apos;s lucky to have a good friend like you .
hi , i called ahead for a few dozen pastries .
my name is hackett .
thank you .
principal hackett .
hi . how are you ?
emily fields .
i @-@ i was just thinking about you .
really ? why ?
we &apos;ve got a job opening at the high school .
head swim coach .
you got your degree , right ?
yeah , one last class , but i &apos;m testing out .
well , then if you &apos;re in town permanently
you should think about applying .
we would love to have you back .
that is , unless you &apos;ve already gotten a job somewhere else .
no . no , well , at the radley
but , thanks for letting me know .
i @-@ i &apos;ll definitely think about it .
splendid . well , i gotta go .
hell hath no fury like my teachers
when i forget &quot; thank god it &apos;s danish day . &quot;
thank you .
yeah .
&quot; thank god it &apos;s danish day . &quot;
it &apos;s pretty catchy .
emily fields , you surprise me .
how ?
would you really consider staying here to take that job ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe , i guess .
got it .
yeah ?
the dr. cochran that noel was calling
i checked over a copy of the mary drake file
and i found a mention of a doctor with the same name
that practices in brookhaven .
spence , that file &apos;s more than 20 years old .
what are the odds of us finding any real information now ?
they &apos;re better than the odds of us getting anything accomplished
if we stick around here . let &apos;s go .
okay .
so how was your first day of school ?
usual pranks .
at least you &apos;ve already been teaching there .
it &apos;s not like it was your first time back .
like , deciding to take a job out of the blue or something .
okay , how about we skip the part
where i try and figure out what &apos;s going on
and you just tell me .
i &apos;m thinking about applying for a coaching job
at the high school , and i was wondering
how you &apos;d feel about me being there with you ?
i &apos;m fine with it .
really ?
yeah , in fact i &apos;d love it .
why ? what ? did you want me to say that i didn &apos;t want you to ?
no , no , not at all . i ..
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not , i &apos;m not even sure i wanna do it .
it doesn &apos;t hurt to apply .
no , you &apos;re right .
five years ago , who would have thought
we &apos;d both end up back at rhs ?
it &apos;s aria .
&quot; doesn &apos;t seem like the best night to spend at ezra &apos;s .
mind if i bunk with you at lucas &apos; loft ? &quot;
em , what aria did with ezra &apos;s phone , it &apos;s not your fault .
no , i &apos;m not so sure .
even if i did get her into this mess
maybe there &apos;s a way i can get her out .
hello .
hi .
um , we &apos;re here to see dr. cochran .
we &apos;re the ones who called earlier .
how can i help you ?
oh , i &apos;m ... sorry , we were looking for a dr. cochran
who would have worked at this address about 20 or so years ago .
that would &apos;ve been my father .
did he used to practice here ?
he did . he was an ob / gyn .
he lost his license years ago .
look , i really have to get back to work .
i &apos;m so sorry , doctor , please .
is there any way that we can get in touch with your father ?
we just need to ask him a couple of questions .
look , i don &apos;t know where my father is .
i haven &apos;t spoken to him in years .
you two seem nice enough .
are you in some kind of trouble ?
well , yeah , kind of .
oh , no . uh , sorry , no . not that kind of trouble .
no .
well , then take my advice .
wherever my father is , it &apos;s where he belongs .
don &apos;t go looking for him .
emily , i appreciate you coming . i really do .
and i believe you when you say
that it was your idea to delete the call--
good , thank you .
but that doesn &apos;t change the fact that she still did it .
can you blame her ?
uh , yeah . a little .
she was scared .
of nicole coming back ?
of losing you .
look , ezra , i know what you &apos;re going through .
do you ?
okay . okay , i don &apos;t know , but i can imagine .
and possibility of nicole being alive
it seems like it changes everything .
but don &apos;t let it change everything .
like ?
like the fact that you and aria love each other .
that you proposed to her less than a week ago .
i hear you . i really do .
i @-@ i really need to think this through .
and i , quite frankly , haven &apos;t had time to even ...
i &apos;m sorry , i need to take this .
hello .
uh , yeah , this is he .
really ?
uh , how many hours till they reach the camp ?
no , no , no , please no !
goodness , hanna .
you look like you &apos;ve seen a ghost .
mrs. grunwald , what are you doing here ?
are you alone , my dear ?
yeah , aria and emily are out , but ...
i mean , are you alone ?
caleb and i are ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t wanna be rude , but what are you doing here ?
i had a dream .
what happened in it ?
i &apos;ve never considered the content of dreams to be important .
it &apos;s the impressions they leave that affect me .
impressions ?
well , in this case the dream left me quite unsettled .
the sense was strong enough that i felt compelled to come here .
the sense of what ?
a darkness
around you and caleb .
are the two of you alright ?
this is spencer hastings .
this is dr. cochran , remember me ?
yeah , of course .
i &apos;m the person whose office you had someone ransack last night .
sorry , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about--
stop it , alright .
you and your little friend came to see me
and i didn &apos;t give you what you wanted
so you sent someone back here to break in and find it for you .
but he didn &apos;t find it , did he ?
no .
well , guess what ?
i can &apos;t afford to have your guy come back here again
so get a pen .
a pen ?
write down this address .
oh , yeah , okay . okay .
okay .
431 evangeline highway .
it &apos;s an apartment complex outside of town .
it &apos;s a real pit .
you should feel right at home .
and what &apos;s at this address ?
my father .
at least he was the last time the police called me about him .
and here &apos;s a hint . you want him to talk
you better bring a bottle of whisky .
whisky . got it .
so there . i gave you what you wanted .
now please , call off your dogs and don &apos;t bother me again .
i @-@ i promise i wouldn &apos;t ..
看来诺埃尔 · 卡恩刚刚帮了我们
caleb and i ..
we &apos;re definitely not alright .
none of us are .
someone &apos;s been trying to hurt us .
do you know who that someone is ?
i think so .
but the others aren &apos;t quite so sure .
by any chance , does that person
have a connection with this hotel ?
yeah .
yeah , he &apos;s staying here .
he attacked alison , he kidnapped me
and someone just died in this hotel .
many people died here , hanna ,
before it became a hotel .
their pain
radiates through these walls .
their cries of anguish
still echo .
do you hear them ?
no .
you &apos;re lucky .
it &apos;s deafening .
in &quot; winter &apos;s tale , &quot; we &apos;re prompted to consider
what happens to someone when those around them
incorrectly conclude that they are immoral unworthy
or outright liars .
so what happens to someone &apos;s character
when they &apos;re wrongfully accused ?
well , queen hermione , she wasn &apos;t without fault
but she suffered for a sin she didn &apos;t commit .
so why would her husband , or anyone else
for that matter , put her through that ?
what did shakespeare observe in human nature
that rings true today ?
that some people like to troll other people .
i &apos;d like to think that the bard had something deeper in mind .
but that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the story , isn &apos;t it ?
no . not really .
the king &apos;s ragging on his wife because she slept around on him .
but she didn &apos;t . that &apos;s the point .
whatever .
if you &apos;re the king or the queen and people look up to you ,
you can say or do whatever you want
and get away with it .
until your lies catch up to you .
yeah , well , you &apos;d know .
miss dilaurentis , please report to the principal &apos;s office .
miss dilaurentis , please report to the principal &apos;s office .
i apologize if my coming here disturbed you .
you say you feel this darkness around us .
i wanted to warn you that you are in danger ,
but i see that you already know that .
but from who ?
all i know
is that the source of the threat
against you is close .
very close .
hello , hanna .
take any country drives lately ?
no !
please let me get out of here .
no ! no , please !
freaks .
sounds good . thank you .
bye @-@ bye .
please , sit .
so how are you doing being back here at school ?
i &apos;m fine . yeah , i &apos;m doing great . thanks . i &apos;m glad to be back .
i heard about the shenanigans in your class yesterday .
i &apos;m so sorry that the students put you through that .
it amazes me how cruel teenagers can be sometimes .
must have been extremely unsettling .
nothing i can &apos;t handle .
be that as it may , i ...
i feel the need to ask you if you &apos;re absolutely sure
that you made the right choice in returning so quickly .
i am .
alison , mrs ... miss ...
dilaurentis .
even the strongest person would hesitate
to rush back into things so quickly
after enduring what you &apos;ve been through .
i &apos;m not here to judge , i &apos;m here to support
whatever decision that you make .
but , i want you to be sure
that you know there &apos;s no shame
in taking all the time necessary to heal .
excuse me , principal hackett .
but the crew counselor needs the students &apos; file
for a last @-@ minute letter of recommendation .
go ahead .
so as i was saying ...
i made the right decision coming back here .
i think this place will provide just what i need
to speed my recovery .
hackett .
splendid .
thank you .
okay . hanna , we &apos;re all here . what &apos;s the emergency ?
i had a nightmare that caleb was run over by a car .
but he &apos;s okay .
and then grunwald showed up and told me he &apos;s not okay .
and then noel kahn showed up
and made grunwald &apos;s head explode .
to be fair , that does sound like an emergency .
okay , can you go over that again more slowly ?
and what exactly are you saying ?
that noel kahn is a.d.
you guys , i told you last night .
he stole mary drake &apos;s file ,
he hurt yvonne , he called dr. cochran--
wait , we weren &apos;t even together last night .
no , we were in my dream . catch up .
you guys , he burned us out of the storm cellar
and he wrote on that window .
he probably killed sara
and we know he &apos;s bad because way back
when he pushed that sorority girl down the stairs .
hanna , what about sara telling me
we &apos;re looking for the same thing you are ?
i mean , she and jenna were working with noel .
to find charlotte &apos;s killer .
and that still leaves room for noel kahn to be a.d.
and what about the storm cellar ?
he &apos;s the only one who &apos;d write &quot; i see you . &quot;
maybe .
no , you guys
what about caleb ?
how &apos;s he doing on breaking
the code in the files ?
not good . but what does that matter anyways ?
you guys are never gonna realize
that noel is the one behind everything .
never say never .
oh , thanks , pam .
what else is there to look into ?
nothing . we &apos;re at a dead end .
no . not exactly .
aria and i have a doctor &apos;s appointment to go to .
dr. cochran ?
what &apos;s it to you ?
uh , we were hoping that we could ask you
a few questions about your time at radley ..
and a patient named mary drake .
i don &apos;t often get a visit
from such a pretty couple of girls .
i &apos;m shocked .
i mean , uh ..
every couple of months maybe
if i save enough from social security
call one of those escort services--
curb the perv or the bottle walks .
it &apos;s been a long time since i thought about mary drake .
she was a pretty one .
what else can you tell us about her ?
she lacked common sense and discrimination .
that seems pretty sure .
how so ?
back in the day , i was the on @-@ call doctor
at radley , the , uh , sanitarium
not the wine and cheese bar that they turned it into .
let me tell you .
it kept me pretty busy .
patients weren &apos;t treated very well
and that created
problems .
my job was to make the problems go away .
problems like babies .
babies that were born
and that someone wanted to not be born .
so , mary
oh , yeah , i dealt with two of her babies .
first one was a c @-@ section , right ?
a boy .
i gave him to mary &apos;s sister , jessica .
charlotte .
what &apos;s that ?
you want me to tell the story or not ?
okay .
several years later
damned if mary didn &apos;t get into trouble again .
that baby was a fighter .
underweight but tenacious .
i don &apos;t remember if it was a boy or a girl .
as was the custom then
it was put into temporary custody
of county family services .
so what happened to the child after that ?
not my problem . at least it wasn &apos;t then .
meaning ?
society changed .
rules happened .
eventually , my ability to solve problems became a liability
and radley let me go .
soon after that , i lost my license .
and mary drake ?
haven &apos;t heard her name since then
till you showed up .
keep buying me whisky and
and i &apos;ll come up with something else to talk about .
thank you .
if you see my daughter again
tell her something for me , will you ?
sure .
tell her that she can run from me
and our history all she wants .
she can even pretend she &apos;s someone completely different .
but in the end
she &apos;s gonna want that family more than anything .
you can &apos;t deny human nature .
you always return to family in the end .
well , two days in a row . to what do i owe this pleasure ?
i , uh , thought i &apos;d apply for the coaching position .
what a coincidence .
i was just , uh , interviewing another candidate .
actually , i believe you two were classmates .
paige .
thank you .
so were you surprised to see me at school today ?
yeah . a little .
a lot .
good surprised or bad surprised ?
good . yeah .
how long has it been ? two years ?
nearly three .
when we were living together at stanford
that little place in college terrace .
it &apos;s where my dad died .
it was a tough time .
i was a mess .
that &apos;s all i could think about .
i was the reason we broke up .
hey , as good as things were between us when they were right
there &apos;s no guarantee it would have lasted .
something else could &apos;ve just as easily come up .
yeah ? like what ?
come on , i just took the hit
for a whole relationship crashing .
i had my own rough patch .
i was pretty focused on making it to the olympics .
i remember .
well , then i had a little car accident .
tore up my knee pretty badly .
it heeled maybe 90 % back to where it was .
that last 10 %
that was gonna be the olympics .
now it &apos;s gone for good .
i &apos;m so sorry .
well , we both ran into some bumps in the road .
me , literally .
but here we are better than ever .
so why are you bothering with rosewood high ?
i mean , i &apos;m sure there &apos;s plenty of d1 colleges
that would love to have you on their staff .
yeah , i have a couple applications in
but when this job came up , i figured what the hell ?
yeah . me , me too .
may the best woman win .
yeah .
cheers .
i think we &apos;re gonna need more wine .
i agree .
after years of searching and unresolved questions
a joint operation between local police
and colombian government forces
has been able to successfully locate the site
of a previously secret rebel camp .
this camp has long been suspected
of holding foreign aid workers hostage .
some for years .
there &apos;s been no comment from the colombian government
regarding whether or not the hostages are still alive .
but they promised to release the latest as they have it
and to establish a hotline for loved ones to reach .
god , it &apos;s incredible . the news .
yeah . it &apos;s kind of killing me not knowing .
you should go .
in fact ..
i got you a ticket .
the flight leaves tomorrow morning .
i &apos;ll take you to the airport .
you ..
you didn &apos;t have to do this .
yeah . i did .
i &apos;ve cashed in our tickets to italy .
i ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
well , hopefully ..
once you get there , you will .
do you think noel wrote it ?
i don &apos;t know what to think anymore .
well , whoever a.d. is
they &apos;re still one step ahead of us .
uh , not necessarily . you got to the doctors first .
yeah , and i &apos;ll let you know how helpful that was
after i look into every county childcare employee from the 90s .
well , maybe it &apos;s time we go to the police
and just say it &apos;s noel .
你们真的想死吗
and toby hasn &apos;t left yet
and that detective furey seems reasonable--
what happens if we &apos;re wrong ?
a.d. fries us . that &apos;s what happens .
exactly .
stop !
no , no , no , no , no !
please , don &apos;t do it ! please don &apos;t !
hanna ?
the deal &apos;s on .
i get you the money , you give me the keys .
tonight .
and then you forget you ever heard from me .
my name , the location ,
this number , all of it .
do you understand ?
do you understand ?
good .
the less you know about this , the better .
um , i &apos;m just stopping by to tell you that i &apos;m gonna be
off the grid for a couple of days .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m going to new york .
i have to do some legwork for the design business
lucas and i are building .
do you want me to go with you ?
no . thanks .
i mean , it &apos;s no trouble . this room &apos;s getting kind of old--
caleb , i &apos;ll be fine .
okay .
where you gonna stay ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
anyways , uh , i gotta go .
well , have a safe trip , i guess .
please do not leave your baggage
or any other items unattended .
all items will be confiscated ...
aria .
go .
so did you learn anything else about the job ?
it &apos;s not bad ...
