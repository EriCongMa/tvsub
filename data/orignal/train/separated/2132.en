This is One, Commander McGarrett has the prisoner secured.
You're gonna tell us everything.
Every terrorist cell you and Victor helped arm,
every supplier you worked with, all your trafficking associates,
everyone you've ever sold weapons to.
Chasing my brother and I around the world for five years,
like a little doggy looking for a bone.
You don't think we'd do our homework on you?
You should get that.
You don't speak to your father nearly enough.
Dad.
Hey, Champ.
You all right?
Who are these people, Steve?
Now I know where you get it from.
You got a tough old man here.
I'm offering you a trade.
Your father for my brother.
Come on, Victor, you know how this works.
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
You kill him,
you get nothing.
Give me the phone.
Please.
I can get him to help you.
He'll listen to me. He's my son.
Listen to me, Champ...
Dad, I'm gonna get you out of there, all right?
Don't you worry about it.
I love you, son.
I didn't say it enough.
Whatever these people want, Steve,
don't give it to 'em.
Don't you give it to them!
Dad? Dad?
No more games!
I'm taking my brother now!
This is Transport. We are under attack.
Let's go!
Taking rocket and small arms fire from hostile air.
Come on. Come on. Come here.
No, no! Don't do it!
Put it down!
Come on, Anton.
Come on.
Come on, Anton.
No! No! No!
Put Anton on the phone.
My brother's dead,
isn't he?
Victor, listen...
Isn't he?!
Then so is your father.
No!
Commander McGarrett?
Hello?
Is-is my father dead?
No, he's alive, and he's gonna be fine.
Who am I talking to?
This is Detective Danny Williams.
Easy.
Thank you, Detective Williams.
Can I speak to my father, please?
Yeah, of course. John.
Hello, son.
Dad.
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
What the hell is that thing on his head?
Oh, that's-that's his hair.
Look like one of them Daniel Boone raccoon things.
You been out in the sun too long, McGarrett.
Ugly and funny, huh?
Uh, Sang Min,
This is Captain Grover.
He's with us now, so he's got the right to slap you around,
knock your teeth out if you get out of line.
Take your best shot.
That's nice.
Hey, is there any word from McGarrett?
No, but we don't have any more time.
We got to move now. Does he know what to do?
We'll see soon enough.
Johnny Moreau!
Thanks for coming.
You got five minutes.
Why couldn't we meet at your plac?
I haven't been home in months.
Cops are looking for my ass.
Boy, in those pants, I can see why.
Bro, I think you spent a little too much time in the joint.
You know, just trying to break the ice
before we talk business.
Business?
After you walked out of Halawa,
I figured you'd be long gone.
You know, still looking for my ticket out of paradise,
which is why I asked you here.
I thought you could help me.
Help you?
Now, why would I do that?
Because you stole my business, for one thing.
Brutha, five-O put you out of business,
not me.
I just picked up the pieces.
So you're just a roadkill-eating vulture, is that it?
Brutha?
I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.
That's not to say I don't owe you a debt of gratitude.
That's why I'm here in person, face-to-face.
But for my services, there is a price.
Well, I figured you'd say that.
Sang Min!
Five-O!
Give me the iron.
Do it.
Now.
Get on your knees. Hands on your head.
Johnny Moreau, you are under arrest
for human trafficking, promoting prostitution,
kidnapping...
That rat set me up.
I'm no rat. I'm Five-O. Newly minted.
Kicking ass and taking names.
No, you're a rat. Shut your mouth.
Can I see my family now?
No. What did I tell you last week when we found you?
You didn't find me.
I made myself available for negotiation.
You were hiding in a hole in Ka'a'awa
that made Saddam's ditch look like a palace.
It's called communing with nature.
No, it's called poison ivy on your ass for lack of TP.
Oh, I missed you, Spicy.
Detective Williams.
Okay.
All right, we'll be right there.
What's up?
Hey! I got blood in the car.
Looks like it could be spatter from a gunshot wound.
Still not picking up.
Here's why.
Ok. We should check the hospitals.
Got it.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Somebody took him.
What?
Look at these tire tracks. Somebody took Steve.
Dad! Dad!
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad!
Dad, look what I found.
That's the best one yet, Steve.
What do you think?
Yeah, Mary likes it, too. Show your mom.
What do you think, Mom?
No!
Hello, son.
Hey, champ.
Dad! Dad!
What do you think, Mom?
Come on, man. Wh-Where's the aloha?
Sir, I'm sorry about your golf gear.
Golf g... Man,
this ain't no golf gear.
I had these clubs made special for me.
There ain't another set in the world like it.
Now, you need to find
the joker that stole 'em out of my car,
'cause I'm telling you something right now,
I'm not going back to Chicago without my clubs.
Sir, if you'll just take a seat,
I'll get someone to take your report.
Take a re...
Why you wasting time taking reports, man?
You could be out finding my clubs.
I got a tee time. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Excuse me.
Commander?
Yes.
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. Uh,
my name's McGarrett.
I'm looking for my father.
Commander McGarrett.
Aloha.
Detective Williams. We spoke on the phone.
It's nice to see you.
Yes. Thank you.
Oh, no, that's not necessary.
Mahalo. We say "Mahalo" around here,
right, Duke?
Mahalo.
Could I... could I see my dad?
Of course. Of course. He's in a debrief with the captain.
Come on.
Hey, Cap.
Dad.
Dad.
Welcome home, son.
You all right?
Yeah.
Steve, uh, I want you to meet Captain Kelly.
Commander.
How do you do?
He was a trainee under me, and I'm proud to say
he's going to be the next chief of police.
What can I say? I learned from the best.
Yes, you did.
Where's Victor Hesse?
He, uh... he's on lockdown at the hospital right now.
He say anything?
Well, as per your request, we're leaving that to you.
Steve, what's going on?
The only people who knew I was transporting his brother
were the men in my detail.
All right, there is no way
that Victor could have found out unless he had help.
Who are you?
Eat this.
With the chemicals we're giving you,
you're going to need to keep your blood sugar up.
You going to tell me what the hell is going on here?!
What do you want? What do you want from me?
What have I done to you?
What are you doing?
I'm a cop, you know that?
I'm a cop. They're gonna come looking for me.
They're watching us.
Everywhere.
Can't you see?
No. Stop!
You can't do that. Stop!
No, I won't... I won't let you.
Stop! Get-get away!
Get away! Stop! No.
Get away! Get away!
Well, I guess if you're gonna be homeless,
this is the place to be, right?
I guess so.
Excuse me.
Hey, baby doll.
I know. I know.
Hey, look, uh, I'm just, uh...
I'm just in the middle of something. Can I call you back?
Okay. I love you, too.
See you in a bit.
I take it you're married.
Yes, yes, very. Very married.
I got lucky. Pretty much the greatest woman on the planet, you know?
Right on. That's something.
Yeah.
What's her name?
Rachel.
You got kids?
I do, yeah. One little girl. Grace.
How about you?
I'm seeing somebody. I mean, hopefully, we'll...
Hopefully, we'll get there one day, you know?
Yeah.
It's the best, man.
Actually, my dad said you just moved here a couple months ago.
Is that right?
Yeah, yeah.
What brought you to Oahu?
I don't know. What didn't bring me to Oahu?
I mean, we got beautiful beaches,
you got sunshine all the time.
Got Ono eats.
Place is fantastic.
It's like heaven compared to New Jersey, you know?
Can you please help me find someone?
No one will tell me anything.
His name is Josh.
The police said that he was in a bicycle accident.
If you could just tell me what room he's in.
Are you family?
He's my fiane.
If you're like me,
you spend a lot of time in the sand and surf,
and that can dry out your lips.
So whether it's the North Shore or city breaks,
I never hit the waves without my Surf Kiss Lip Gloss.
It gives my lips that surf-kissed,
want-to-be-kissed look.
Take it from four-time world champion, Kono Kalakaua.
Don't forget your Surf Kiss.
I was enjoying that.
I'm glad that you were enjoying it,
'cause that's probably the closest you will ever be
to a pretty woman for the rest of your life.
You underestimate my resources, Detective.
You'd be surprised what a man can do
with the right friends in the right places.
Well, that's... that's why we're here,
to talk about one of those friends.
Specifically the man who ordered you to kill my father.
Maybe I came up with that on my own.
Maybe I wanted to bury your father
just because I could.
Right. Yeah, you see, I know you loved your brother,
but I also know that you didn't come up with that all by yourself.
You got entry into this country.
You got our comm links,
you got my extraction route.
Now, that came with a price,
and that was my father's murder. Right?
Gentlemen, I'm afraid I won't answer any questions
until I've retained counsel.
You won't answer the questions.
Look. I-I personally love it
when a guy with a foreign accent tells me to beat it.
It just sounds so much nicer, you know?
Let's go, let's go.
No, no, no. Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
What does this do?
You can't do that.
You can't do that.
He's right. You can't do that.
No, no,
No, you see, I can do that, huh? Right?
Because Bono here is not a U.S. Citizen.
That means he is not subject
to our constitutional protections.
Listen, you're... you're incorrect. Okay?
He-he's been arrested on U.S. Soil.
He's allowed those rights. You-you know that, right?
He doesn't know that. Lock the door.
Lock the door?
Never mind.
What?
What the hell is going on in here?
Hey, don't be rude.
We're obviously having a conversation here. Leave.
Hold this pillow, would you?
Do me a favor. Also, while you're out there,
call the coroner and tell him to get a table ready.
Okay,
No, stop, stop.
What? What kind of cop are you?
The kind of cop that gets things done.
Excuse me.
Hey, look at me. Right here. Look at me, right here.
Right here...
That's enough. Enough, enough.
Enough?
Enough, yeah.
No. No. It's not enough, okay?
You told me this man is a terrorist.
9/11, I was there.
I was in New York City, okay?
So this guy gets no mercy from me, okay?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't ask you the question.
My bad.
Hey.
What?
Don't unlock the door.
Do not unlock that door.
Hey! Open up!
What's going on in there?
If you don't like what I'm doing,
you can wait in the toilet, okay?
Open up!
This man, he tried to execute your father yesterday.
All right? And I don't think he's going to talk
without a little friendly persuasion.
Open up!
Hey! Give us a minute, please!
Do whatever you gotta do.
Thank you.
Wait. Wait.
What?
I'll tell you what you want to know.
Who told you about my op?
If I tell you,
you're going to wish I hadn't.
Yeah?
I'll take that chance.
Who told you about my op?
Good.
You're up.
Let's begin.
You're never gonna break me.
Behavioral engineering works, Steve.
You know that.
It just takes time.
Now, tell me...
where's my father?
I don't know.
You expect me to believe that?
No.
But it's the truth.
Well, where's my office gonna be?
Say something stupid again and I'll shoot you.
Ooh, Spicy...
Sorry.
Oh, we meet again so soon, huh?
Why's he up there?
We believe that Wo Fat
abducted McGarrett this morning.
Oh, and you think I know where he is?
No, you're too low on the food chain
to be on his radar.
Kick a man when he's down, huh?
All right, cut it out.
Think. Think hard.
Associates.
Anyone with the resources who would be able to
help Wo Fat pull this off.
What's going on?
Do you know Anthony Shu?
No.
Are you sure?
He's supposedly an investor in one of your father's companies.
Kono, I don't know the name of every one of our investors.
What does this have to do with anything?
We think Wo Fat abducted McGarrett this morning.
Sang Min says he uses the alias Anthony Shu
to do business in the United States.
Okay, um...
I'll go to the office, get everything I can.
Okay. Thanks.
This can end
if you just tell me what I want to know.
If you're gonna kill me,
just do it.
Steve, if I wanted to kill you,
I would have done it long ago.
Think about it.
Okay.
You want to know where your father is, yeah?
Ask Doris.
I know about her trips to Colorado to come see you.
You should have asked her when you had the chance.
I asked our mother.
She said she didn't know.
What did you say?
You just said "Our mother."
What do you mean by "Our mother"?
She's not your mother.
I ran the DNA, okay?
I ran the DNA.
She's not your mother, all right?
What are you giving me?
What...
What are you giving me?
Something to help you tell the truth.
Authorities have identified the victim as Doris McGarrett,
a local schoolteacher
and also the wife to Honolulu Police Sergeant John McGarrett.
Now Mrs. McGarrett leaves behind two young children.
HPD officials say they will be investigating this tragic incident,
which has left one Aina Haina family in mourning.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
Yeah, copy that. Thank you.
Okay, so my sources never heard of a Wo Fat.
Okay, all right, I mean, I just...
You know, who would make up a name like Wo Fat?
Well, I mean, you-you put two holes in the man--
he would've said anything to get you to stop, right?
Look, um, I'm-I'm pretty sure that your Navy buddies,
uh, they're up to speed on everything,
but if it happens here on this island,
there's one man to talk to.
This better be good.
You're interrupting my lunch.
I'm sure all the other inmates are happy about that.
What are you intimating?
By missing a meal, everyone in this place will eat?
And if I don't, they starve?
Sure... Uh, lighten up, would you?
Why don't you shut up?
And who are you?
Strippergram?
Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett.
And what do you want, Commander?
Well, Detective Williams here told me
you might know where we can find a man named Wo Fat.
Try hell.
Yeah? Any stops along the way?
What's in it for me?
What do you want?
Fresh shrimp. Twice a week.
I'm tired of the Spam.
Okay.
There you go.
Done.
Now tell us where to find him.
My father.
Where is he?
I already told you. I don't know.
Very well.
No, no, no, no.
I can't tell you what...
what I don't know...
what I don't know.
Why try to kill my father?
What did he ever do to you?!
What'd he ever do to you?
Commander?
Look, I know you know that this is Hawaii,
but, uh, we usually don't wear uniforms
unless we're going to a ceremony.
See?
I'm, uh, heading out.
Well, that's, uh, that's too bad, you know?
'Cause I was thinking about what we did.
I thought maybe, uh, you'd be interested
in a career in law enforcement.
What do you say? "A career in law enforcement"?
That's right, yeah.
Um, I don't know. Maybe, maybe someday.
All right, well, you think about it.
You ever get homesick, uh, I'll put in
a word with Captain Kelly and maybe, uh,
put you to work. What do you think?
Tell you what. I could, uh,
I could get used to be being chauffeured
around all day, that's for sure.
That's right.
See you around, Danny.
Hey! Danno.
Call me Danno. All my friends do, all right?
All right, Danno.
Safe flight, buddy. Okay?
All right.
All right, take care.
Navy's taught you well.
You son of...
I'm gonna kill you.
And then I'm gonna find your father.
I'm gonna kill him just for having you.
Then you're going to have to kill your mother, too.
What are you talking about?!
Your mother is more responsible
for who I am today.
Stop talking in circles!
You know nothing about the real Doris McGarrett.
Do you?
I know...
...that she was assigned to kill your father.
But instead your mother died in that op.
Yes.
And she never forgave herself for murdering
an innocent woman
who had just become a new mother.
That pain and anguish
caused her to do something quite... remarkable.
She took in that child and raised it as her own
for several years.
Until her superiors discovered this...
and forced her...
They forced her to abandon
that child.
That was you.
You see?
Doris McGarrett...
was my mother, too.
If Doris knew where my father was,
she would've told me.
But with your persistence,
I can't help but believe
you know where your government is holding him.
I don't.
That may be true.
But I need to be convinced.
I'm telling you the truth.
I don't know where your father is.
Hey, guys.
I think I may know where Wo Fat is.
Where?
就像打开的伞 下面网罗了众多参股公司
Well, a few years ago, Anthony Shu used an umbrella company
to purchase a chain of dry cleaners from one of our subsidiaries.
Well, they all closed down, except for one on Makaloa.
It's a 12,000-square-foot facility.
Hey, you can't be back here.
Okay, it's fine. Everything's fine. Everything...
Come on.
You're not going to kill me.
Are you?
Brother?
You're not my brother.
I miss this view.
I'm glad you're home, son.
Me, too, Dad.
Steve?
Steve, you all right?
All right, all right.
Come on.
You all right?
Huh? You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, where's my father?
Where's my father?
I want to see my dad.
I want to see my dad.
Buddy, your dad died four years ago, okay?
All right?
Yeah, yeah.
You're all right.
You're all right.
I'm good.
L- let's go.
All right? Yeah, let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Wait, wait.
Let's go.
Come on, man.
