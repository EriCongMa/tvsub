the girlfriend @-@ boyfriend discussion , which we haven &apos;t .
you don &apos;t think you &apos;re my boyfriend ?
no , i never said that .
i &apos;m just talking terminology .
we &apos;ve never had the terminology .
we &apos;ve never had the terminology .
what ?
we &apos;ve never used the terminology .
it &apos;s funny you act like you &apos;re my boyfriend ,
you have all the privileges of being my boyfriend .
i enjoy them .
would like me to revoke those privileges ?
no , you &apos;re twisting my words .
what i &apos;m saying , jess ,
is we &apos;ve never had the boyfriend @-@ girlfriend ,
seeing other people conversation .
we haven &apos;t had the seeing other people conversation ?
you &apos;re seeing other people ?
no , i &apos;m not . are you ?
no .
jess , i &apos;m just ...
we haven &apos;t had the conversation is all ,
and it &apos;s a conversation
that i , personally , would love to have .

jess , it &apos;s when coach is here ,
i just ...

nick !
i &apos;m really sorry .

i &apos;m going out tonight
because we haven &apos;t had the boyfriend @-@ girlfriend talk ,
and we haven &apos;t had the seeing other people talk ,
and i &apos;m gonna bake a cake , a pineapple upside down cake .
in terms of the metaphor , i &apos;m really ...
okay . don &apos;t !
go to the strip club , nick .
knock yourself out .
oh , don &apos;t wait up , jebecca .
yeah , it &apos;s jess .
right on .
men suck .
nick isn &apos;t even a man .
he &apos;s like some man @-@ boy ,
man @-@ child hybrid .
the other day , i had to tell him
not to pull a dog &apos;s tail .
i shouldn &apos;t have to do that .
if a guy wants to play games , jess ,
you got to play them right back .
right , good .
what does that mean ?
i &apos;d make him jealous .
yeah , right , yeah .
and there are a lot of guys out there
that want to hook up with you .
there is this one guy , artie ,
from the coffee shop who asked me out .
oh , actually , you have my number .
so give me a call ; maybe we can go out sometime .
shut your face !
you should maybe give this guy , artie , a call and see ...
no , that &apos;s too real .
that &apos;s just way too real .
then why do you have his number in your phone ?
i just like looking at it ; it &apos;s not weird .
no .
but it has , like ...
a lot of fours in it .
you know , you know what i mean ?
no , i don &apos;t .
lacey !
oh , which one of y &apos;all want a lap dance ,
because wb just hit the atm .
oh , hold up .
shrimp forks , why &apos;d you get so much bunny money ?
what is bunny money ?
that is bunny money .
that &apos;s not real money ; look at the bill .
president rabbit with two big ass jugs .
damn , man .
it &apos;s fine ; as long as you didn &apos;t take out too much , you &apos;re okay .
hey , schmidt , i took out $ 2,000 .
you keep making mistakes , winston .
oh , isn &apos;t this great , guy ?
awesome .
yeah , man , the best .
and it &apos;s gonna keep getting better ,
because we &apos;re not leaving here until the sun comes up .
hey , yo , bricktop !
we about to get it popping .
whistle while you twerk !
that man has so much confidence .
it &apos;s amazing .
until the morning ? i can &apos;t do this , schmidt .
i &apos;m so tired . i &apos;m having anxiety here .
i have an 8 : 00 a.m. presentation , that means
i have to get there at 7 : 45 to lower everyone &apos;s chairs .
jess hasn &apos;t texted me back . i &apos;m starting to freak out .
here &apos;s what i think we should do .
i think you should be the one to just kind of tell him
that we want to leave and that maybe
you want to leave and then we &apos;ll all go together .
why do i have to be the heavy ?
all right , fellas !
all right , he &apos;s back !
so i got dancers for each of us ,
plus one floater to play the zone .
oh , defense !
yeah ! here &apos;s a crazy idea .
shoot , man .
what if we got out of here ,
went back to the loft and just hung out ?
you &apos;re going through a big breakup , let &apos;s talk it out , man .
yeah , yeah , let &apos;s just , um ,
go home and talk feelings .
no .
i was with malia , now i &apos;m not .
there , we talked about it .
oh , look at the time .
it &apos;s butt o &apos;clock .
you whipped .
shut up , schmidt .
you whipped , straight @-@ up whipped . you whipped .
i &apos;m not whipped .
whipped like cream cheese .
yeah , you are .
whipped like cream cheese . whipped !
so , cece , i &apos;m thinking of firing off this text to nick :
&quot; loving single life . &quot;
should i add a &quot; whoo @-@ hoo &quot; or is that too bitchy ?
look who i called .
hey , jess .
shut your face .
what ?
oh , looks like you could use a new drink .
barkeep , can i please get a shirley temple
with a finger of coconut rum and a lemon squeeze ?
i call it a temple grandin because it makes me friendly
and compassionate .
i have a boyfriend .
no , she ... no , she doesn &apos;t .
yeah , i do . she do .
no .
obviously , this is a bad time ,
and , uh , you &apos;re involved .
in some shape or other .
no , no , no . she &apos;s free as a bird .
cece .
all right ,
well , he &apos;s a very lucky man .
i hope he realizes that .
oh , don &apos;t move .
you &apos;ve got an eyelash .
there we go . make a wish .
i &apos;m afraid to .
all right , take care .
big mistake .
i shook his hand . i had my fun .
do you think that nick is in the strip club right now
shaking hands ? no .
because he is a man .
you can &apos;t trust them , jess .
okay ? the moment you let your guard down ,
they just walk all over you .
tonight is the night to beat them at their own game .
hey , artie !
bet you can &apos;t lift me !
uh , all sales of bunny money are final .
how am i supposed to spend $ 2,000 on dancers ?
oh , no . our dancers don &apos;t take it .
what ?
however , uh , bunny money is redeemable at the bar ,
our gift shop and our sister club in fort myers , florida .
what ? !
body shot .
you taste delicious , do you know that ?
what is that ? an aftertaste ?
probably baby formula .
tuesday nights !
girl , you are a pistol .
i &apos;ll tell you what ,
how &apos; bout you and me go back
and i dance on you this time ?
oh , man .
tuesdays nights .
you know , for a chub , you &apos;re a terrible heavy .
let &apos;s just get coach really drunk until he passes out .
then we take him home .
shot contest .
shot contest .
like in raiders of the lost ark , schmidt .
i &apos;m not ripping a page from that pro @-@ nazi film .
it isn &apos;t pro @-@ nazi .
of course it is . it might as well be an ss propaganda movie .
no , everybody in a nazi uniform literally dies .
yeah , the ... when she puts the hand into the , uh ...
the heart .
no , not ... well , that happens , too . nazis .
i don &apos;t think that makes you a nazi .
they ate the monkey brains , and there was all the bugs .
nazi , nazi .
nick &apos;s at a strip club ,
but he &apos;s just being a normal guy in his 20s that wants
to hang out with other guys in their 20s .
they &apos;re all in their 30s .
yeah .
enough about nick .
what do you do when you &apos;re not making coffee at the coffee shop ?
well , actually , i own the coffee shop .
what ?
it &apos;s not as glamorous as you may think .
it &apos;s a lot of spreadsheets
and jetting off to brazil at a moment &apos;s notice .
nick &apos;s never been to brazil .
maybe you should step away .
you know , call nick up and hash things out .
hmm @-@ mm , can &apos;t call nick
&apos;cause then he &apos;ll know i &apos;m thinking about him .
and then he wins .
maybe you both win .
say brazil again .
brazil .
say &quot; rubber baby buggy bumpers . &quot;
rubber babbuggbumpers .
oh , my god !
shot contest isn &apos;t working .
it &apos;s only making him stronger .
it &apos;s jess .
hey , jess , i &apos;m so glad you called !
nick , can i talk to you for a second ?
oh , is that , uh , notorious n.a.g. ?
hey !
is that naggie gyllenhaal ?
hey , i don &apos;t need your help checking my woman .
you &apos;re checking your woman ?
wait , how did you hear that ?
you were covering the listening part , dummy .
yeah , but they look the same .
i &apos;m too drunk .
well , i &apos;m way drunk , too , and i &apos;m with a man .
what ?
he owns a business , and he goes to brazil .
nick ? nick ?
oh , it &apos;s a coin flip .
hello ?
he &apos;s so immature .
jess !
jess , i got it .
hey , i think you guys have had enough .
why don &apos;t you let me give you a ride home ?
wait , you weren &apos;t drinking ?
oh , no , no , no , i don &apos;t drink .
i got to get a jump on the morning .
well , you really have it together .
i bet you can use a phone , too .
your bar for having it together is set pretty low .
i don &apos;t think this is such a good idea .
we can just grab a cab home .
cece , this was your idea .
artie , can we take your jet ?
oh , it &apos;s just one coffee shop .
wouldn &apos;t you like to know ?
all right , guys , give it up for candy !
is that lobster gray ?
most expensive thing on the menu .
i got to go .
what ?
jess is drinking and talking to some guy .
forget her , dude .
relationships are prisons .
how often do we get to hang out like this ?
i haven &apos;t seen you in two years .
strippers and booze forever .
hear , hear .
there it is .
no , stop , no , no .
relationships are not prisons ,
and jess is amazing .
she &apos;s sexy and sweet ,
and i can &apos;t lose her .
so i &apos;m going home to see her .
why are you crying ?
we can see each other tomorrow .
i didn &apos;t break up with malia , all right ?
she broke up with me .
why didn &apos;t you say anything , man ?
&apos;cause i was embarrassed , winston .
i lost her .
i was just trying to fill a void with all these naked chicks .
i don &apos;t want to be here .
i want to be in love .
oh , coach , this is so pathetic .
now she &apos;s dating some dude
named derrique . or derek .
coach , you need to go home , and i need to go home , too .
you &apos;re right , man .
you have to fight for your relationships .
freaking derrique . let &apos;s go .
mm @-@ mmm , guys , guys , you cannot leave .
dude , i was just crying . i want to get out of here .
it &apos;s embarrassing ; he cried in a strip club .
all the des saw me cry ; dude , i want to leave .
man , i got bunny money coming out of my pockets .
wait a minute , this ain &apos;t the way home .
yeah , we &apos;re just gonna make a quick stop .
we &apos;re gonna kick malia &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s ass .
wait , this is a police station ?
西洛杉矶警察局
uh @-@ huh , that &apos;s where he works .
you want a drunk fight a cop ?
he stole my girlfriend .
did you hear the joke about the two black guys
and two white guys who walked into a police station ?
the two white guys came out .

winston ?
i got two of these ,
and you got one more of those .
put that away .
coach !
coach .
let &apos;s do it .
coach , no !
let &apos;s get raucous .
i &apos;m ready .
we &apos;re not ready !
he is pure life force .
he &apos;s a lunatic , man .
i got to get out of here .
i want to go , too ; i got a work thing .
well , i got a girl thing , dude .
work trumps girls .
girls are replaceable ; jobs are forever .
i bet i get left with the fare . i just bet ...
hey , driver , let me just ask you something .
do you like strippers ?
do you also like the deal of a lifetime ?
i wanted to leave first .
i &apos;ve been saying that the whole night ,
and none of you guys can stop me .
you think that you can ... you can ...
beat me in a physical altercation of fisticuffs ?
i will beat you in a way
that you &apos;ve never been beaten before .
damn it !
you got hit in the face , son .
hit me again .
&apos;cause i swear
you &apos;ll be ... i &apos;ll be ...
loosen up your neck so i can put you
into the headlock of a lifetime .
guys , it &apos;s escalating , look !
i &apos;m a cop , pew , pew , pew .
no , no , no , no , no .
thanks for the ride , artie .
bathroom &apos;s down the hall .
it &apos;s the one with the urinals .
i do live with men .
nay , boys .
look , if he can pee in brazil ,
he can pee at my house .
do you actually like this guy ?
what ?
no , no .
nick couldn &apos;t call me his girlfriend ,
and that hurt .
now i want to hurt him back
with some long hot conversation .
that &apos;s what you really want to do ?
yes .
men suck , remember ?
i &apos;m sorry about saying that ,
because i put that on you , all right ?
that &apos;s because i &apos;m going through something
right now with schmidt .
you have nick .
nick &apos;s a child
who drinks on tuesdays .
you &apos;re drinking on a tuesday and you are a teacher .
those kids are watching a movie tomorrow .
look , nick doesn &apos;t have a life plan .
he doesn &apos;t have a day plan .
i once found a note he wrote to himself
that said &quot; put on pants &quot;
followed by a question mark .
that means it read , &quot; put on pants ? &quot;
also , he throws pizza at seagulls ,
which i guess is kind of nice
because he &apos;s trying to feed them .
and he &apos;s a really ,
really great kisser .
you have something really good .
just go get artie and tell him to leave , all right ?
can you just get derek ? !
he &apos;s gonna get the whole precinct !
this is a high @-@ income area .
they &apos;re very bored in there .
got to get sober , got to get ...
oh , my goodness , the jacket smells like gasoline .
guys , come on .
come on , man , we &apos;re too old for this .
we &apos;re too old for this whole night .
what ?
life changes .
you got to grow up .
i did ; i &apos;m in a relationship , and i &apos;m happy .
schmidt moved out of the loft , and he &apos;s happy .
i &apos;m miserable !
it &apos;s your fault .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m in a vacancy room !
a room of vacancy ! empty nest !
by choice ! by choice !
let me tell you something , when i &apos;m done with you ,
your face is gonna look all melted
like the president at the end of raiders .
he wasn &apos;t a president ! you saw a different movie
than everybody else in the world !
i &apos;ll kill you !
he wasn &apos;t a president .
guys , guys !

but i think somewhere along the way ,
some signals got crossed .
signals could not have been any clearer .

i &apos;m fixing to mix you up .
seriously ?
oh , men are such dicks .

i &apos;m sorry , man .
hop along , bunny money .

i &apos;ll take that .
fantastic .
it only cost you $ 2,000 .

this is your worst nightmare .
there &apos;s a very good @-@ looking man in my bed ,
and he &apos;s naked ,
and i &apos;m flushed , and i &apos;m flustered .
i might as well just spray paint &quot; jay cutler sucks &quot; on the wall
and just round out the whole image , right ?
but , nick , nothing happened ,
and nothing was ever going to happen ,
and you have to believe me , please .
say you believe me , please .
