buying a phone is a big deal .
i mean think about once you have these things .
it &apos;s like buying your car
or a bra .
eight years , man .
umm sorry . i was just checking your credit score .
i got this number that is crazily low , so ...
i &apos;ll try again .
don &apos;t bother . i &apos;m sure it &apos;s right .
seriously ?
are you kidding me ?
250 ? ! you get 150 just for being alive .
hey , mojan !
got a 250 credit score !
well , i guess the $ 40 i saved on that gap card didn &apos;t pay off .
do you have a box of charity phones you &apos;re sending to africa ?
can he just have one of those ?
claire , brendan ,
this guy &apos;s got a 250 credit score .
we &apos;re bringing everybody out ?
look at this .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve been doing this a long time .
i &apos;ve just never seen a score this low .
did you just wake up from a coma ?
but you &apos;ve always wanted a thing .
this could be your thing , like , the guy with no phone .
well , who is that guy ?
i don &apos;t want to be that guy .
no , no , no , it &apos;s like mysterious .
it &apos;s like , &quot; i want to call nick miller . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t ; he doesn &apos;t have a phone . &quot;
&quot; what ? ! &quot;
you can go all ghost protocol on everyone .
see , that &apos;s cool .
i mean , i always wanted to be a mole person .
schmidt , you &apos;re the michael jordan of bar trivia .
we were in the greek mythology zone .
i mean , you knew every question .
perseus , icarus , medusa ...
medeuce , deuce !
guys , you &apos;re shouting .
i mean , you knew every answer .
like , what was the tiebreaker you got ?
calvin coolidge &apos;s birthplace ?
little plymouth notch , son .
wow , i &apos;m done with this . hey , shelby ...
i mean , seriously , how did you know that ?
question : how do you forget that ?
answer : you don &apos;t .
jar !
i &apos;m gonna jar myself on that one .
he &apos;s like a trivia god .
girl , get up .
winston , don &apos;t worry about it , man .
it &apos;s your public school education .
you &apos;ll catch up .
jar again .
excuse me ?
yeah , hi , hi , i &apos;m russell schiller , sarah &apos;s dad .
oh , yes .
we spoke on the phone .
i &apos;m jessica day .
did you just curtsy ?
i did , yes ; i did .
is this a bad time ?
nope , no , no , no , i was just cleaning up
from the sexual health class .
i had to take condoms off 30 cucumbers ,
and condoms are harder to take off than i thought .
i know how to put them on ,
but i didn &apos;t know how to take them off .
i guess someone else has always done it for me .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . i just got off a flight from london .
maybe i &apos;m a little out of it .
oh , london .
did you have a busy sch ...
sche @-@ dule ?
did you have fun ?
no , i was advising a merger .
oh , fair enough .
um , you wanted to talk to me about sarah &apos;s art .
so , this is one of the pieces she did .
that one &apos;s called , um ,
&quot; at the mall with grandma . &quot;
she made that in dream @-@ cess ,
which is where , um , i let the kids have time to create something .
sarah &apos;s gonna be opting out of dream @-@ cess from now on .
she &apos;ll use that same time
to review her other schoolwork with a tutor .
oh , did you talk to sarah about this ?
well , i don &apos;t need to .
i want her to know fractions before she goes to high school .
well , i follow the curriculum .
my daughter is wearing doll &apos;s heads around her neck ,
so whatever you &apos;re doing ,
keep it up .
okay , i talk to your daughter every single day .
do you ?
because hiring a tutor
is not the same thing as spending time with her .
i &apos;m her father , not her friend .
i know what she needs .
give my best to mrs. monogamy .
he &apos;s the third largest donor in the city .
we take his money and then what , we have to answer to him ?
so , you &apos;re asking me to give up my integrity ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you to do .
yes , we need his money .
so , he pulls his donation .
you know what ? i &apos;ll raise the money myself .
i &apos;ll get a ragtag group of kids together .
a lost soul , an orphan ,
a jewish kid with a keyboard ,
a little slut who can dance ,
and one fatso ,
and i &apos;ll choreograph some dances ,
make a show .
you did that already , jess .
it &apos;s called the spring musical , and it literally brought in $ 60 .
please don &apos;t make me apologize .
you &apos;re gonna go to his office .
you &apos;re gonna say that you were wrong .
say you &apos;re never gonna let the kids do anything creative
ever again .
from now on ,
your classroom is full @-@ on north korea :
math ! math ! math !
make sure he doesn &apos;t pull the donation .
when he was yelling at you ,
did do that little thing with his mouth ?
you know , that little smile thing ?
you know , like , like where he goes , &quot; mmm &quot; ?
that &apos;s really weird , tanya .
apologize .
why did you make me look stupid in front of shelby last night ?
wait , what ?
which of the five great lakes is located
entirely in the united states ?
lake erie ?
yeah , if lake michigan didn &apos;t exist
and we won a fictional u.s.- canada war .
lake michigan .
correct !
oh , you want me to take a dive next time ?
take a dive ? you know , like pretend like
you know more than me when shelby &apos;s around ,
so it seems like you &apos;re smarter .
i know you &apos;d do the same thing for me if i were the dumber one .
wow , okay , so let me get this straight :
you think because you know a few facts about princess kate ,
that makes you smarter than me ?
first of all ,
kate is a duchess and whip @-@ smart by all accounts .
and second of all , don &apos;t be so prideful .
look , man , there &apos;s nothing wrong
with being the second smartest in the loft .
you know what , let me take that back .
jess is a teacher of children .
you memorize facts .
i can memorize facts .
that doesn &apos;t make you smart .
okay , well , maybe ,
but i &apos;m definitely smarter than you .
whew ! glutes are done , my man .
i &apos;m gonna go to the stairwell ,
work on my calves . come with ?
hell , no .
you sure ?
i have to grovel .
i hate groveling .
i would have lasted two seconds
in the court of the sun king .
i think about that all the time .
you do ?
do you know how much i grovel on a daily basis ?
it is literally obscene .
come the weekend ,
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s filling up my cart
with fila , nautica , impulse fila , hilfiger , ck ,
br leather cuff , and more fila .
this is the problem , jess .
it &apos;s rich people .
we are right where they want us , jess ,
just suckling on the teat of consumerism .
yeah .
that &apos;s the exact reason i got rid of my phone .
you were denied a cell phone
because you have the credit score of a homeless ghost .
how i got here doesn &apos;t matter .
you weigh more than your credit score .
i &apos;m here now ,
and i &apos;m loving it .
yeah .
i &apos;m the guy with no phone .
i mean , right now , i &apos;m writing a letter to my friend , kev ,
seeing if he wants to party with me this friday .
&quot; what up , kev ?
&quot; you in ? nick miller . &quot;
yeah , nick ,
he might pull the funding from the school ,
so i &apos;m just a little bit ...
blame your period .
i &apos;ve actually done this before .
i mean , both parties knew that i was lying , obviously ,
but it didn &apos;t matter because they knew
that i had utterly humiliated myself ,
and at the end of the day , they respected that .
i &apos;m sorry ; i just feel like
someone should suggest a simple apology .
i know that &apos;s not where we &apos;re headed here ,
but i &apos;m just gonna go on record and say ,
i think you should apologize
like a human .
no !
no ! i &apos;m going with nick
&apos;cause i don &apos;t think i have to apologize .
yeah , jess , so march into his office ,
and say , &quot; hey , mr. fancyman , you can &apos;t tell me what to do .
&quot; your money doesn &apos;t own me . &quot;
and then throw away your phone .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna throw my phone into the fiery chasm
where he keeps his poor people .
actually , scratch that .
my mom &apos;s got your number in case of emergency .
i want her to think that i can bring something to the table .
i care about this girl , elvin .
i want her to be my girlfriend .
she sees me , all she sees is a part @-@ time nanny , and that &apos;s ...
you are a part @-@ time nanny .
i want her to think i &apos;m smart .
what about fake glasses ?
it worked for me .
okay , okay , i &apos;m on my way to his office ,
and i have a speech i wrote for fancyman ,
and i want to practice it .
why are you listening to nick ?
it is a horrible idea .
ghost protocol , man .
you &apos;re using my phone .
it &apos;s not ghost protocol .
it &apos;s you using my phone .
this is a group call , i &apos;m just talking in my living room ,
and it happens to go into that box .
okay , i &apos;m gonna start with a quote against social darwinism ,
then a discussion of the gilded age ,
the robber barons , the great society ,
how we ended up with a huge wealth disparity in this country ,
and then , i end with a bluegrass version
of public enemy &apos;s &quot; fight the power . &quot;
bad finish .
what is that ?
are you driving a lawn mower ?
no , i just ...
it &apos;s my car .
look , this is a great opportunity .
you need to ask yourself ,
where are you even going ?
buy a new car .
you don &apos;t need a car .
oh , my car &apos;s stalled out .
can you guys come and help me push it ?
yeah , we &apos;ll be down in a few minutes .
hey , can i help you ?
what ? oh , hi .
uh , mr. schiller , um ,
how &apos;d you know i was here ?
i was driving by and i saw you .
my office is right here .
oh , oh , what a coincidence .
i had no idea .
weird .
what &apos;s wrong with the car ?
guy sounds like a matinee idol .
shut up , schmidt .
i &apos;m just pushing it to the nearest gas station .
it &apos;s like , a mile away , so i &apos;m fine .
i know a guy , he &apos;ll be here in ten .
oh , no , mr. schiller .
russell .
mr. schiller , i can take care of myself .
it &apos;s how i was raised , i wasn &apos;t raised with money ,
so when something broke , we pretended it still worked .
some of my best memories are pushing this car around
on family vacations .
okay .
oh , yeah , tow truck &apos;s on the way .
look , that &apos;s very nice and generous of you ,
but i really ... i @-@ i mean , i need my car , and ...
here , let me help you .
take mine .
what ?
take mine .
here .
no .
come on . take mine .
i don &apos;t know how to drive cars that work .
you can drop it off tomorrow night .
i &apos;m having a party , a cookout .
come on over any time . come on .
thank you so much .
this is amazing .
i will return it washed and polished .
do you think it &apos;s a superhero ?
no .
i think it &apos;s jess and some weird guy .
miss day ?
jess-- you can call me jess .
great , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow , jess .
go is the one on the right .
the one on the left is stop .
thanks .
what kind of car is it ?
we are the 99 % .
is it an sl ?
we the 99 % .
does it have a push ignition ?
please tell me it &apos;s not a hybrid .
and then he gives me his car , just hands me the keys .
it &apos;s like so ...
rich people ! they &apos;re always giving you their cars .
it &apos;s like , let them eat cars .
you know what he &apos;s doing ?
he &apos;s taking back the power ,
so i have to go to his cookout ,
and instead of standing up to him ,
i have to grovel .
just a thought :
what if he likes you ?
no , i hate him .
this guy is single and he &apos;s sweet .
sweet ? no .
he &apos;s not sweet .
i would never go for that guy .
why ?
because he &apos;s the type of guy
who has a linen closet and a towel warmer .
you know me .
i &apos;m only attracted to guys
who are afraid of success
and think someone famous stole their idea .
i like an underdog .
spencer didn &apos;t even own sheets .
yeah . he slept on a pile of washcloths .
can i say something to you now that you &apos;re not gonna like ?
no .
maybe russell intimidates you .
because you wouldn &apos;t have to take care of him ,
because he would take care of you ,
and that just terrifies you .
uh , no .
spencer ... wore ... jellies .
how many pounds in a metric ton ?
2,204.6 . next .
in 1948 , albert became the first ...
american ...
... american monkey in space .
let &apos;s go .
this ancient ...
mesopotamia . hit me .
you don &apos;t actually know what a mesopotamia is .
of course i know what mesopotamia is .
don &apos;t be crazy .
use it in a sentence .
look , there &apos;s mesopotamia .
so i &apos;m going to have to draw
on your hatred of rich people for this , okay ?
hate me up .
well , for starters , look at this place .
i know . ugh .
i &apos;m betting at one point there was a moat .
rich boy punk .
this hallway &apos;s excessive . it &apos;s braggy .
well , i guess everyone &apos;s out back .
ugh , look at this place , jess . are you kidding me ?
it &apos;s so over @-@ the @-@ top .
a kitchen island ? be a man !
let your counter attach to itself .
i know .
it &apos;s like , i can &apos;t chop vegetables over here .
i need to do it over here . love me , love me .
i mean , we &apos;re making an egg ,
not going to outer space , guys , right ?
right . nice burn .
makes me want to sit by the fire ,
and talk about how annoying gandhi is .
whoa , something &apos;s happening to me , jess .
i want to sit at that desk and veto a law .
what are you doing , nick ?
that &apos;s someone else &apos;s stuff .
jess , when i put my hand on this desk ,
i feel sexually proficient for the first time in my life .
nick , this man stands for everything you hate .
i &apos;m president miller ! you &apos;re all fired !
bring our boys home .
okay , this is how evil geniuses are born .
you smell that ? it smells like leather
and teddy roosevelt and wistfulness .
i want to wear this cap .
you &apos;re not helping me !
nick , i know this room is beautiful ,
gentlemanly , and ... smells like christmas ,
but you have to stay strong .
i &apos;m gonna go find russell .
keep ... playing with that duck .
i want to kill you .
because i respect you .
i think i understand hunting !
hello , russell .
hey , jess . thanks for coming .
oh , the mechanic called . your car &apos;s done .
he also wanted me to communicate to you
that you need to change your oil .
i want to , first of all , say thank you , russell .
um , and second of all , i want to say , um ,
i know you donate a lot of money to this school , but ...
you think i &apos;m a snob .
no . no .
no , i have nothing against people who ...
live in enormous mansions .
jess , i &apos;m 42 .
i &apos;ve made a lot of money , and i enjoy spending it .
oh , you &apos;ve got to try one of these . oh .
deconstructed spring roll .
it &apos;s delicious .
try it .
oh , my god !
this is so amazing i want to punch you !
russell ! russell .
come tell carolyn about that time you delivered that baby .
oh . yeah .
you delivered a baby ?
just ... it was twins , actually .
twins ?
are you wearing my sweater ?
no . yes . it was on the back of the chair .
so i thought the sweater belonged to the chair .
i thought it was a chair sweater .
those exist .
i &apos;m nick .
oh , you know jess .
yes .
i &apos;m jess &apos; roommate . i &apos;m the guy with no phone ,
if she &apos;s told you . that &apos;s my thing .
no phones .
why don &apos;t you have a phone ?
because i don &apos;t want to be tied to some corporate system .
that , and no one would give me one .
i have incredibly low credit ratings .
yeah .
when i was your age ,
i had a really skinny ponytail ,
and i think i was living off of selling my own blood .
that &apos;s funny . then what happened ?
one day you just woke up and you had all this ?
well , i realized i wanted to grow up .
that &apos;s what happened . um ...
i got this as a gift from the company for christmas , so ...
oh , wow , that &apos;s great .
my boss gave me three credit cards he found at the bar ,
and said , &quot; you didn &apos;t get these from me . &quot;
it &apos;s a bartender joke . i &apos;m a bartender . we ...
we don &apos;t steal credit cards . cool , cool .
here . take it .
no , no , i can &apos;t take your phone , man .
i can &apos;t ... it &apos;s just ...
it feels really good in my hand .
is it possible to be sexually attracted to an object ?
yes , it is . it really is .
you can keep the sweater .
thanks , i ...
i don &apos;t know why i put it on , to be honest with you .
i just came in here , and it smelled like shakespeare ,
if shakespeare were a damn cowboy .
and hawk &apos;s nests , and boat fuel , and cigars and burping ...
man stuff !
yeah , yeah , enjoy it .
thank you .
yeah .
i appreciate you .
yeah , yeah . sure .
hey , russell , why are you being so nice to me ?
well , you &apos;re jess &apos;s friend , right ?
now , you fold that sweater .
don &apos;t hang it .
you listening to me ? fold it .
ah , i don &apos;t care . do whatever you want .
that was really funny , man !
why did i ... ?
bidet ! yokuso .
bidet if i do .
oh , my god !
oh , my gosh . shut up .
jess , is that you ?
oh , god ! oh , god .
what &apos;s wrong ?
sorry , jess . i &apos;m coming in .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , my god ! i just ...
wait , wait , wait .
no , i just pressed some buttons
with cartoon characters on them .
yeah , it &apos;s japanese .
of course it &apos;s a japanese bidet .
of course you have a japanese bidet .
look , russell , i want to tell you
that i am not sorry about what i said
because sarah is 12 , and she is creative ,
and i don &apos;t care if you pull your donation ,
i am not gonna grovel ...
why did you think i was going to pull the donation ?
i would never do that .
okay .
oh , jeez .
it is some really deep cleaning here .
oh , god .
no , jess , jess !
wait !
jess , you put it up to six happy faces .
i &apos;ve never gone past three .
jess , why are we leaving ?
and why are you all wet ?
okay , did you take a bath in his tub
because you wanted to see what it &apos;d feel like to be him ?
&apos;cause , weirdly , i get that .
no . i want to leave
because we don &apos;t fit in here , nick .
i know that i &apos;ve been saying you can &apos;t give into this guy ,
but i don &apos;t think that you should run from him , either .
&apos;cause no matter where you go , he could find you .
i believe that .
no , running &apos;s good . i &apos;m gonna run .
hey , jess , stop .
look , this may complicate things ,
but i &apos;m in love with him .
shut up !
no , i won &apos;t shut up .
he smells like strong coffee
and going to see a man about a horse .
you &apos;re ridiculous , nick . let &apos;s go .
i am ridiculous , okay , but no .
be a grown @-@ up .
he likes you , jess .
go back in there .
i think it &apos;d be good for you .
and i &apos;m not just saying that because i &apos;m in love with him .
just do it .
don &apos;t be intimidated just because you &apos;re just younger ,
poorer and wetter than everybody in there .
goldfinger ! i mean , no , no .
i meant to say golden @-@ golden hind !
golden hind is what i meant to say .
no ...
winston ,
you are all over the place .
the green bay packers
did not invent the t formation ,
nor was crispin glover the first man to die
in the revolutionary war .
this is supposed to be fun .
look , babe , it is fun .
i just don &apos;t want to look stupid in front of everybody .
all right ?
you &apos;re not stupid .
well , i mean , he did skip earth
when listing the planets .
what has gotten into you today ?
i just ... i just didn &apos;t want you to think i was an idiot .
you tried to memorize all the trivia answers ? winston !
i don &apos;t want some
smart , rich guy who owns his own car .
i want to be with you .
i don &apos;t care if you don &apos;t know
ernest hemingway &apos;s birthplace .
oak park , illinois .
so , what are you saying ?
are we doing this ? is this real ?
like , are you my girlfriend ?
because if that &apos;s what you &apos;re saying ,
then that would make me very happy .
mm , me , too .
shelby , be careful with his mustache , please .
it &apos;s very delicate .
i can &apos;t watch this anymore .
winston , i hope you &apos;re better in bed
because your street work is embarrassing .
am i talking too much ?
i don &apos;t want to ruin the moment .
you know what ? if this was my grandmother &apos;s building ,
she &apos;d be outside on the patio ,
and she &apos;d be yelling down at you ,
and she &apos;d be saying ,
&quot; you look beautiful .
the two of you are a beautiful couple .
i &apos;m glad you found one another . &quot;
but she wouldn &apos;t invite you up
because she &apos;s a horrible racist .
you want me to put on some jodeci ?
there you are . i was looking for you .
okay ....
listen .
i &apos;m not used to people who have it all together .
i think ... you scare me .
oh , no , no , i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t have it all together .
i don &apos;t even know how to talk to my own kid .
i can &apos;t even remember the last time she hugged me
and used both arms .
she said she wanted to go bra shopping ,
and so i bought her a ski vest .
look , every eye roll
means you &apos;re doing something right .

no , that &apos;s just what
i tell parents to make them feel better .
jess , will you have dinner with me ?
yes .
