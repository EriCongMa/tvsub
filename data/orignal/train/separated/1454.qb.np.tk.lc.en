how you doing ?
phil dunphy .
what do i have to do to get you to ask
&quot; what do i have to do to get you into this car today ? &quot;
well , why don &apos;t we start it with a test drive ?
i &apos;ll get the keys .
sounds good .
right where i want him .
come here . come look at this .
this thing warns you if you deviate from your lane .
in my car , that &apos;s my wife .
&quot; andre , if you try to kill me ,
i swear i will kill you ! &quot;
well , i guess this is what i &apos;ll be driving for the next 39 months .
this is my d.n.a. talking ,
but you do not seem sufficiently excited
about the prospect of driving a new cadillac .
no , it &apos;s great . i &apos;ve just leased the same thing forever .
part of me wants to shake things up .
i don &apos;t know .
get something like ...
like that .
colonel klink , that is nice .
we took lily on her first train ride .
just a quick trip to chinatown .
i was worried she would think
we were taking her back to vietnam ,
but she seemed okay .
yeah , yeah .
possibly because she was an infant when she left vietnam .
also , vietnam is not china .
well , i had a lollipop with me just in case .
i love that we &apos;re doing this .
it &apos;s important for her to explore the city she lives in .
so much diversity .
keep your wallet in your front pocket .
my shoe &apos;s untied .
oh , sweetie , it is . here , have a seat .
right here . there you go . hey , hold bunny .
no ! no , no , no , no , no , no !
bunny !
how did you miss that , mitchell ?
mr. conductor ! i @-@ i ...
what ?
i was purell @-@ ing !
and it &apos;s me ! why would you toss it ?
because my hands were full ?
i want bunny !
i know . w--okay , i have an idea .
let &apos;s catch the next train and ride it till it catches up .
they don &apos;t catch up . that &apos;s called a collision .
okay , well , do you have a better idea ?
you &apos;re the one that lost it .
no , you tossed it .
he who tossed it lost it .
don &apos;t try to clever your way out of this .
daddy lost bunny .
she means you .
oh , i wanted a car like this since i was a kid .
me , too .
i used to imagine the wind blowing through my perm ,
blasting some hall &amp; oates ,
maybe horsing around with my mr. microphone ...
yeah , we wouldn &apos;t have been friends back then .
you should buy it .
no , it &apos;s not practical .
practical ? you never see a person on their deathbed
saying , &quot; i wish i &apos;d have been more practical . &quot;
i see a lot of people on their deathbed , phil .
a lot .
i thought you operated on knees and elbows .
phil , this is a nice car .
and it &apos;s half the price of a new car .
if you don &apos;t buy it , i will .
what would claire say ?
you know what ? maybe we should find you
something with a little more lumbar support .
yeah . you know , with you not having a spine and all .
i have a spine .
do you have a spine ?
i have a spine .
so wanna take it for a spin ?
you know what ? i &apos;d rather take her for a spin .
let &apos;s get her top down
and see what she can do .
i &apos;m--no , i meant the convertible .
第三季 第二十一集
well , i just talked to the concierge ,
and room service will save me a bread pudding .
load off my mind .
you mock me , but &quot; travel and leisure &quot;
says it &apos;s not to be missed .
this weekend , we &apos;re going up to pebble beach .
i &apos;m gonna meet a bunch of guys i played high school football with .
man , those were the good old days .
yeah , unless you were a woman ,
black , hispanic , or gay .
true , but if you were a straight white guy
who played football ,
you really couldn &apos;t have a bad day .
gloria ?
which watch should i pack ?
this one &apos;s showier . this one &apos;s more expensive .
why do you care so much about a watch ?
how do i say this without sounding like an ass ?
i &apos;m kind of a legend to these guys .
not like that .
who &apos;s your daddy ?
whoa ! whose car is this ?
mine !
i talked him into it .
seriously ? mom &apos;s gonna let you have this ?
luke , luke , luke ...
where is she ?
dad , i don &apos;t like this .
why not ?
my friend molly &apos;s dad bought a sports car ,
and now he lives in a studio apartment
and dates a girl who works at forever 21,
which she won &apos;t be for two years .
hear that ?
honey , i &apos;m not leaving your mom .
might not be your call .
oh , my god , it &apos;s so pretty !
i love it ! and i love you ,
and i promise i &apos;ll take super good care of it !
can i tell her ?
please . i ask for so little .
alex , be nice to your sister .
it &apos;s dad &apos;s car , not yours .
what ? but you &apos;re too old for this !
it &apos;s just like last year
when you wouldn &apos;t take off those skinny jeans .
wouldn &apos;t or couldn &apos;t ?
hey . i looked hot .
and you look hot in this car .
let me tell you something about your dad .
your dad is a man who knows what he wants ,
and he gets it .
at least that &apos;s what i heard .
you know , i was there more as a friend and an observer than anything .
andre .
hey , claire .
honey . is this the new car ?
i know it looks impractical ,
but andre &apos;s seen a lot of people die .
i &apos;m not upset .
i &apos;m not upset . it &apos;s a beautiful car .
just surprised you didn &apos;t get the sedan , that &apos;s all .
beautiful .
good seeing , you , cl--
mm . it &apos;s beautiful .
what just happened ?
she did not blink once .
do you wanna come in for a minute ?
no , i gotta ... you know , i gotta get to the wife .
well , do you ...
uh , do you need a ride or anything ?
no . no , no ,
i &apos;m gonna , uh , i &apos;m @-@ a jog .
why--why are you running ?
i &apos;m just gonna jog !
lily was up all night because she didn &apos;t have bunny ,
which means that we were up all night
because she didn &apos;t have bunny .
god , she must have cried for ...
how long was it , cam ?
cam . cam .
oh , sorry .
uh , last night was rough because lily ...
covered it .
didn &apos;t have bunny .
jay , tell me , why are we on the runway ?
surprise ! we &apos;re taking a private plane .
wow ! i &apos;ve never been on a private plane !
and you never will .
i am not getting on that little thing !
what if the rubber band snaps and we fall out of the sky ?
it &apos;s perfectly safe . it &apos;s a legitimate airline !
hey , folks .
whoa . nobody said three .
all right . before we take off ,
i &apos;m gonna need to get everyone &apos;s weight here .
no problem . i &apos;m about 190 .
okay .
oh , yeah . in that case , i &apos;m 275 .
gloria , i would never put you and manny in danger .
now come on ! trust me on this !
beautiful .
it &apos;s american music the whole way ,
and i don &apos;t wanna hear a word .
how you doing there , sport ?
great . yeah .
awesome . you know what &apos;s awesome ?
is this car has the engine in the trunk ,
so that means i get to ...
put these signs in the seat , which is cool .
very cool .
what ?
oh , nothing . my , uh , client just wants me
to pick her up on the way to the open house ,
which is great . i &apos;ll , uh , drop the sign off
and just swing across town to ...
oh . she &apos;s bringing her mom and a designer .
well , maybe they &apos;ll fit in the trunk .
here it comes !
what ? i was making a joke .
what &apos;s your game , woman ?
i have no game . you &apos;re an adult . you can make your own choices .
since when ?
do you wanna borrow the minivan ?
yes , please .
okay , fine . then you &apos;re gonna have to pick up the kids from school .
okay , i can &apos;t take it .
if you got something to say , just say it .
i have nothing to say .
that just says it all .
well ... ok .
all--all right . thank you , serena .
see you tonight .
good news--they rescheduled my massage for the morning .
bad news--it &apos;s a dude .
don &apos;t blame me . it &apos;s your mom &apos;s fault .
do you know how many people have died in these planes ?
john denver ,
patsy cline ,
ritchie valens .
i &apos;ve heard you sing . i think you &apos;re safe .
all right , look ,
the welcome dinner starts in four hours .
it &apos;s a 5 @-@ hour drive .
no bathroom breaks .
yeah , i think you &apos;re gonna want to hold on to that cup .
damn it !
what was that ?
giant pothole .
the dash is lighting up like a christmas tree .
tire &apos;s blown !
this never would have happened if we were in the air !
if this had happened in the air , we wouldn &apos;t be in the air .
we would be in rock &apos; n &apos; roll heaven !
okay , what do you think ?
i &apos;m gonna put these in the subway .
okay , it looks like , uh , lily &apos;s missing
and we &apos;re offering $ 25 to get her back .
oh , don &apos;t be ridiculous . no one in their right mind--
okay . that &apos;s all i see now .
how about this one ?
okay . um ...
&quot; missing--stuffed bunny . brown and white fur .
sympathetic eyes . &quot; what are sympathetic eyes ?
not those .
i just--i don &apos;t really love the idea
of our phone number being up in the subway .
okay , let &apos;s play a different game .
how about i be the problem , and you be the solution ?
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t be so critical .
i know you &apos;re just trying to--got it !
just came up with a better idea .
took me less than five seconds .
okay ...
i can &apos;t hear you . what ?
window .
i don &apos;t know ...
gah ! what did i do ?
oh . oh , my .
yes . hi .
hey , nice car .
thank you .
you gonna drive up the coast , or ...
oh , no . i &apos;m gonna do some errands , actually .
yeah , &apos; cause other people might go and buy a crazy car
with an engine in the-- in the trunk , but not me .
no . i &apos;m responsible . mm @-@ hmm .
we have three kids . you can &apos;t pick up three kids in this car .
you can &apos;t .
you--it ... it ...
i &apos;ll get you ... catch ya .
i &apos;m going !
maybe i was a teeny bit mad .
so i blew off my errands and headed up the coast .
it was my turn to be irresponsible .
and luckily , i had sunscreen in my purse .
well , your strut &apos;s shot ,
and we can &apos;t get parts for at least a day .
fantastic .
i don &apos;t suppose
there &apos;s any place you can rent cars anywhere around here ?
know what , sir ? we &apos;re not some one @-@ horse town .
of course you can rent a car .
it just happens to be out for the day .
unbelievable .
we &apos;re gonna miss the whole weekend .
i am sorry , jay .
i know how much you mean to those guys ,
and i know how much they want to see you .
i &apos;m so sorry .
uh , excuse me .
you are ...
so pretty .
and if you really need to get somewhere ,
maybe i can help you out .
ay , yes , please ! thank you ! anything !
check it out . restored it myself .
no .
i did not get in the little plane at the little airport !
i &apos;m not gonna get in this ...
flown by that guy that couldn &apos;t fix our car !
gloria , it &apos;s either this ,
or we &apos;re in the motel .
i don &apos;t like the sound of that .
a lot of amenities disappear when an &quot; h &quot; becomes an &quot; m. &quot;
you know , when i met you ,
you were eating cereal out of a bucket .
hey , lily , guess what ?
what ?
uh , we just heard from bunny .
this is a terrible idea .
no , it &apos;s fantastic .
bunny said he &apos;s on an amazing adventure
having the time of his life ,
and that you should pick one of his best friends
to sleep with while he &apos;s gone .
bunny doesn &apos;t talk .
this is going great .
he does now , because--
because he took talking lessons .
so what do you think , huh ?
turtle or giraffe
or , uh , little reindeer ?
where &apos;s bunny now ?
uh , st. louis .
why ?
he &apos;s visiting his girlfriend .
he doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
he has a boyfriend !
i want bunny !
okay . no , no , lily .
lily , uh , what about miss , uh , teddy bear ?
huh ? no ? uh , dr. tiger ? no ?
mr. fish ?
i want bunny . i &apos;m going to st. louis .
really ? you don &apos;t know nemo ?
it &apos;s on an endless loop in the den .
i have a job .
and then bodie kicked it to me ,
and i dribbled it past michael and got it to tyler ...
i was bummed not to be in my new cool car ,
so i wasn &apos;t joking around with the kids like i usually do .
and i would &apos;ve scored if that kid didn &apos;t trip me .
i can &apos;t believe the ref didn &apos;t see it .
i bet olivia saw it .
she &apos;s always watching you when you play .
yeah , i know . it &apos;s like she &apos;s in love with soccer .
ugh . stop texting me !
what ?
corey . he is so clingy .
but , you know , there &apos;s something about driving your kids around .
you &apos;re in the front , they &apos;re in the back .
they forget you &apos;re there ,
and you learn so much .
you &apos;re like sigourney weaver in &quot; gorillas in the mist . &quot;
except gorillas make less noise chewing .
once i hit the coast highway , i didn &apos;t stop .
i turned off my cell phone .
i ate fish tacos for lunch . it was insane !
i haven &apos;t felt that free in years .
all my stress completely disappeared ...
and so did my keys .
i &apos;m sorry , but ... these signs are ridiculous .
oh , you &apos;re right . i should have used helvetica .
it much better represents the urgency of our situation .
no , the lengths that we &apos;re going to for a stuffed animal .
you know , cam , maybe it &apos;s time lily learned about loss .
no , she &apos;s 3 , and i know .
do you know how many times
i had to say good @-@ bye to a furry friend on the farm ?
and didn &apos;t it make you stronger ?
yeah , because i was a growing boy
and they were chock @-@ full of protein .
but it was still heartbreaking .
it builds character .
you know , once , when i was a kid ,
my dad left my luke skywalker doll on an airplane ,
and i was so angry--
wait , which--which luke ?
shorty robe or dress blacks ?
shorty robe .
oh , my .
and you know what he did to get it back ?
not a damn thing . nope .
he didn &apos;t lift one pudgy finger to make a single phone call ,
and i got over it .
yeah , well , i want you and lily
to have the same healthy relationship
you and your father have . for sure .
all right , give me these flyers .
i &apos;m gonna take everything to this side of the homeless guy .
mitchell !
sorry , what are we supposed to say now
home @-@ challenged ? or ...
no , look !
oh , my god ! it &apos;s bunny !
oh , lily &apos;s gonna be so happy .
oh , that &apos;s so great . go ahead and get it .
what , me ?
yeah .
why should i go and get it ?
well , i @-@ i &apos;m not gonna do it .
why ? i spotted it .
you &apos;re closer .
it &apos;s your journey . luke skywalker ?
pattern @-@ breaking ? your father ? get in there .
fine .
sir--hi , sir .
hello , you--you ...
hello .
hello .
he @-@ hello ? sir ...
i @-@ i can &apos;t ...
oh , for god sakes !
let her hate us .
you turned out great .
i did , didn &apos;t i ?
you &apos;re a big lawyer .
this is not the massage i had in mind .
all right .
okay .
in about an hour , a train goes through town
that will get us close to pebble beach .
now it &apos;s not technically a @-@ a passenger train ,
so it won &apos;t be stopping .
what ?
so we gotta get running real good .
no high @-@ heeled shoes . and it wouldn &apos;t be wrong
if we took that blanket with us , either , huh ?
so what do you say ? anybody up for a hobo adventure ?
if we &apos;re voting , i &apos;m a &quot; no . &quot;
manny , we &apos;re gonna be right back .
we &apos;re gonna get some ice from the machine in the parking lot .
classy .
jay , this is getting crazy . is it worth it ?
i wanna see the old gang .
do you wanna see them or you want to show off to them ?
the private plane , the fancy watch .
you still want to feel
that you &apos;re the big kahuna on the campus .
that &apos;s not it . that &apos;s not even a thing .
you know what ? i &apos;m taking manny home .
if you want to go in the takka @-@ takka @-@ takka @-@ takka ,
okay , go to pebble beach by yourself .
no , what ? that &apos;s not the plan .
if you wanna go there so bad ,
that &apos;s the only way you &apos;re gonna get there .
i &apos;m not trying to get me there .
i &apos;m trying to get you there !
what ?
look ...
i may have exaggerated the size ... kahuna i was .
i may not ...
technically have been a kahuna .
i was shy , and i spent most of my time ...
on the bench .
but you always made it sound like you--
oh , i know what i made it sound like .
people didn &apos;t expect much from me ,
and , um ...
they certainly didn &apos;t expect me
to end up with ... somebody like you .
so this is all about you
parading me around like a trophy ?
yes .
why didn &apos;t you say so ?
i can be a trophy !
come on . we need to get this up to pebble beach .
manny ! we &apos;re leaving ! get ready !
oh , good . if we get out of here in the next ten minutes ,
we don &apos;t have to pay for the second hour .
how you doing there , sport ?
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
thanks .
so ...
whatcha doing all the way up here ?
did someone snap ?
a little . yeah .
i was mad at you for buying that stupid sports car .
i knew it !
and i was wrong .
it &apos;s a great car . god , i had the best day .
phil , i did cartwheels .
without me ?
yeah .
hey , did you know there &apos;s a girl with a crush on luke ?
olivia .
yeah .
oh , and haley &apos;s totally done with corey .
that &apos;s new .
alex is teaching herself chinese
so she &apos;ll be useful when they finish buying us .
she &apos;s so weird .
i really want to be able to drive the kids around .
i need a bigger car for work . i made a mistake .
no , you didn &apos;t . you bought it for a reason .
when did we stop coming to the beach ?
i think it was when alex
started printing out water quality reports .
she &apos;ll be china &apos;s problem soon .
you know ...
we don &apos;t need a sports car to get out here .
we should just make a pact .
once a month , we get out to the beach .
and we tell everyone we &apos;re running errands .
yeah .
yeah .
so you didn &apos;t get to the dry cleaner ?
they say the important thing in life
isn &apos;t the destination .
it &apos;s the journey ,
the challenges you face along the way ...
the unexpected twists and turns ...
the disappointments you overcome .
look what i found on the internet .
oh , my god ! it &apos;s luke skywalker in his shorty robe !
i love it , cam--- .
mine !
but they &apos;re wrong .
it &apos;s all about the destination ,
especially when the destination
is your amazing oceanfront hotel .
thank you again , serena .
warmest regards , manny delgado .
what &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s sending flowers to the concierge .
oh , jeez .
hey ...
credit card .
she wore you down , didn &apos;t she ?
this is not about claire .
i really want to sell you the car .
it &apos;s sad . she got you to believe that .
no , i ...
turns out i &apos;m just not a convertible guy .
well , your loss is my gain .
it &apos;s a sweet ride , phil .
right ?
it really is .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
i &apos;m getting , like , a whiff of mildew .
i don &apos;t smell anything .
yep . that &apos;s mildew .
this car &apos;s been in the flood .
it &apos;s a katrina car !
i &apos;m offended that you tried to sell me a katrina car , phil !
your wife won &apos;t let you have a convertible , will she ?
we will never know , &apos; cause i &apos;m afraid to ask .
see you later , phil .
