you took everything from me , klaus .
let bygones be bygones . resentment gets old .
no one ever gets old ? revenge .
no .
what &apos;s the matter , klaus , missing something ?
i will kill you and everyone you &apos;ve ever met .
do that and you &apos;ll never see your family again .
the spirits hate klaus as much as we do ?
they &apos;re using their powers to hide in the coffins .
it just won &apos;t open . i &apos;ve tried everything .
and then it &apos;s closed with a spell .
he &apos;s been sired .
he feels loyal to klaus because klaus &apos; blood created him .
i &apos;m not giving klaus anything .
he &apos;s gonna kill jeremy .
not really my problem .
jeremy , move !
i have no idea how you &apos;re on your feet right now ,
but i need to run some more tests .
actually , i have someplace i need to be , doctor ...
fell .
your sister thinks we should have another one of our talks .
you &apos;re going to leave mystic falls behind
and never think twice about it .
i thought for one second
that i wouldn &apos;t have to feel guilty anymore ...
guilty for what ?
for wanting what i want .
you &apos;re gonna put a hole in that thing .
wanna talk about it ?
nothing to talk about .
morning .
you &apos;re late . we &apos;re supposed to meet bonnie
at the old witch house in 10 minutes .
relax , brother . you don &apos;t want your hair to fall out .
would you hurry up ? we have work to do .
you know , klaus isn &apos;t going to spontaneously self @-@ destruct .
why are you all chipper ?
no reason . be with you in a minute .
so , uh , what &apos;s got you all worked up ?
i didn &apos;t really sleep last night .
yeah , me neither .
probably something to do with dying .
are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine . i think the ring , however ,
is running low on batteries .
yeah , it &apos;s another reason why jeremy has to get out of town .
if those rings have a shelf life , he &apos;s not protected .
neither are you .
nice . nice . you &apos;re getting stronger .
i &apos;m channeling frustration .
i need coffee .
i guess damon &apos;s compulsion worked .
jeremy was packing when i left the house .
he was going on about his new schoolin in denvor .
have you , uh , talked to damon today ?
no .
why ?
no reason .
phesmatos sapren emnis labortum fecils quisa exsilum son .
phesmatos sapren emnis labortum fecils quisa exsilum son .
uhh ! why won &apos;t you open ?
hello ?
is someone there ?
you didn &apos;t say anything to elena about the coffins , right ?
no . i said i wouldn &apos;t .
i know what you said .
then why are you asking ?
because protecting the location of klaus &apos; family
is my number one priority right now
and the fewer people who know , the better .
what ?
these hybrids are really bringing the neighborhood down .
hey , sorry i &apos;m late .
i , uh ... i got held up .
it &apos;s ok . i just got here , too .
will you pass me the balloons ?
thanks .
what got you running late ?
i , uh , was working on some new spells .
you ?
working out with alaric .
卡罗琳
so , uh ...
i have something i need to tell you ...
and you &apos;re not going to like it .
what happened ?
jeremy &apos;s going to be leaving town for a while .
he &apos;ll be staying with some old family friends in denver
until this whole klaus thing blows over .
jeremy wouldn &apos;t just leave you to deal with klaus on your own .
i know .
i asked damon to compel him .
you what ?
i know , bonnie .
but it &apos;s not safe for him here anymore .
leaving will give him a better life .
the only reason i &apos;m telling you is because i know
that you two haven &apos;t really worked out your stuff .
i kinda thought maybe you &apos;d want to say good @-@ bye .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
it won &apos;t open .
did you bury the body ?
yeah .
any sign of our little hybrid buddies ?
nope , just the dead one .
all right , klaus has 6 siblings .
rebekah is now with klaus .
there was one dead kid in the old world ,
one dead kid in the new world ,
which leaves elijah and 2 others ,
3 sleeping originals , 4 coffins .
so , who was in the lockbox ?
no idea . but whatever &apos;s in here ,
bonnie seems to think will help us kill klaus .
so , as soon as you can get this thing open ,
the sooner we &apos;ll know she &apos;s right .
you &apos;d think the spirits of a bunch of dead witches
that can make a coffin invisible ,
that they &apos;d figure out how to open one !
fine , don &apos;t help .
you know none of this is going to do us any good
if klaus &apos; hybrid friends find our hiding spot , right ?
they need to go away .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s a great idea , stefan .
why don &apos;t you just ask him to pack a bag
and take a long vacation while you &apos;re at it ?
how about you keep the peace ?
don &apos;t draw attention to the very things
that we &apos;re trying to hide .
no . i &apos;m not going to play defense
when i have what klaus wants .
he does what i say
or i dump his family to the bottom of the ocean .
then he kills you and everyone you know ,
like , i don &apos;t know , me .
no , he &apos;s bluffing .
his family means more to him than anything else .
you sure about that ?
oh , i don &apos;t know , damon .
i mean , i guess there &apos;s only one way to find out , right ?
call his bluff .
whoa . the only way to call someone &apos;s bluff , stefan ,
is to be willing to lose everything if you &apos;re wrong .
denver , huh ?
so , were you going to say good @-@ bye ?
i wasn &apos;t sure you cared .
of course i care .
i was hurt by what happened between you and anna , jeremy .
i don &apos;t want you to leave town .
i think this could be a good thing ,
at least until all this klaus stuff blows over .
i think i can have a better life there .
that &apos;s what elena said .
it &apos;s exactly what she said .
what do you mean ?
nothing .
i &apos;m just sorry you have to go , that &apos;s all .
i can &apos;t talk to you .
i know you &apos;re upset with me .
upset ?
but i ...
you almost got jeremy killed .
and before you ask me to understand or to support you ,
can you at least tell me what you &apos;re planning to do
about your sire bond to klaus ?
there &apos;s nothing that i can do about it , caroline .
that &apos;s the point .
i just wanted you to know that ...
i understand why you can &apos;t be with me .
even though i want to put you first , before anyone ...
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;ll never be able to .
and i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i just wanted you to know that .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
happy birthday .
sweet dreams , rebekah .
show her to her room , would you , love ?
sure .
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re still in town .
i gave you your freedom . you could have gone anywhere .
i live here , klaus .
well , if we &apos;re playing this game ,
then , uh ... i was here first .
you know , i don &apos;t like your hybrid friends .
they &apos;re everywhere , kind of like fleas .
i want them gone .
i kind of like having them around .
you know , i &apos;m hurt .
i hoped that , uh , i &apos;d free you
and we &apos;d pick up where we left off ,
but here you are ,
guzzling vervain like the rest of them , i &apos;m sure .
so much for friendship .
friends don &apos;t strip friends of their free will .
ok , granted , yeah , that was a little extreme ,
but i get a little moody .
just ask my siblings .
speaking of whom ... isn &apos;t it time you handed them over ?
klaus ...
get your hybrids out of mystic falls
or i will remove them myself .
you see , if you continue to threaten me ,
i &apos;m going to be forced to retaliate .
kill people .
and it &apos;ll get messy again .
do whatever you want . i don &apos;t really care .
or you know what ? maybe i do .
yeah , maybe i care so much
that i drop elijah into the arctic .
well , maybe i &apos;d be willing
to lose one brother if it meant killing yours .
try me . let &apos;s find out .
is everything ok ?
everything &apos;s fine , mindy .
stefan was just leaving after failing to make his point .
well ... one down .
you may want to , uh ,
send the rest of them away before it gets messy ...
again .
surprise !
surprise !
happy birthday !
what are you guys doing here ?
well , you blew off school and missed our
work of birthday art , so , uh ...
change into warmer clothes , we &apos;re going to the falls .
s &apos;mores , campfire .
cake . like when we were little .
except with tequila .
ah , thanks , guys , really .
um ... i &apos;m just not really feeling my birthday this year .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
you &apos;ve already claimed your birthday
as everyone &apos;s favorite day of the year .
yeah . and now it &apos;s just a reminder
that , technically , i &apos;m dead .
look , i didn &apos;t even like 17 .
the only point to 17 was to get to 18 .
it &apos;s a filler year .
i am stuck in a filler year .
you &apos;re not stuck , caroline .
yeah , i am . but it &apos;s ok .
you know , it &apos;s all good . i will be fine .
but i just need some time to wallow in it .
ok .
well , i think i have another idea .
what do you want me to do with her head ?
just get rid of it . burn it .
i honesty don &apos;t care , daniel .
you called ?
i &apos;m here .
what happened ?
what happened is stefan had 2 paths in front of him
and he chose the one that made me angry .
i need you to help me do something about that .
can &apos;t you just leave me out of it ?
what would be the point in that ?
seriously , man , can &apos;t you just get
one of your other hybrids to do your bidding ?
i lost my friends , my girlfriend .
right , your , uh , your girlfriend .
um , about her ... i need you to bite her .
what ?
don &apos;t make me repeat myself .
a hybrid bite would kill a vampire .
yeah , yeah . i know exactly what it will do .
uh , stefan pushed me too far , so i &apos;m pushing back .
i &apos;m not biting caroline !
tyler , i &apos;ve been supernaturally blessed
with the good fortune of a sire bond to you ,
so one could consider this
me putting your undying loyalty to the test .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i &apos;m not hurting caroline .
all right .
all right .
i &apos;m disappointed , but you know ,
it &apos;s your choice , free will and all that .
i &apos;ll find another way to strike at stefan .
you can go now .
i thought stefan saved your life .
he did .
and now he &apos;s willing to risk it
just to see how far he can push klaus ?
seems so .
well , is his humanity on or off ?
yeah , i &apos;m thinking there &apos;s another option here in play ,
a bit of a dimmer switch ,
which is a huge problem .
why ?
because i can &apos;t predict how far
he &apos;s willing to go until somebody gets killed .
suddenly you care who lives or dies ?
i have a small list .
talk about humanity dimmer switch .
screw you .
can &apos;t the council meeting ever
just be a council meeting ?
there it is .
this is creepy .
even for us .
no , caroline was right .
technically , she &apos;s dead .
sorry . but you don &apos;t need a birthday ,
you need a funeral .
you need to say good @-@ bye to your old life
so that you can move on with your new one .
ok .
here lies caroline forbes .
cheerleader , miss mystic falls ,
third grade hopscotch champion .
friend ... daughter ...
overachiever .
mean girl , sometimes , no offense .
none taken .
she was 17 and she had a really good life .
so , rest in peace so that you can move forward .
that &apos;s what you really need .
it &apos;s what we all really need .
amen or cheers or whatever .
uh , bonnie ...
nice .
ok , make a wish .
this is the bridge where elena &apos;s
and jeremy &apos;s parents died in a car accident .
something &apos;s up with her .
elena . something more than usual .
do you know what it is ?
well , i &apos;m sure it starts with a &quot; stef &quot; and ends with an &quot; n. &quot;
i &apos;m gonna get a drink ,
write a check , and then we &apos;re out .
well , alaric saltzman ... miracle patient .
dr. fell .
i &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re still alive .
half of me thought you &apos;d drop dead in your sleep .
yeah , well , i guess i have 9 lives .
not a bad thing to have in a town with a vampire problem .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
are you on the founders &apos; council ?
i &apos;m a founder . i come from a long line of founders .
may they rest in peace .
i hate that bridge .
my senior prom date dumped me on this bridge .
oh , yeah ? did you throw him over it ?
no , but i should have .
i &apos;ve been holding a grudge ever since .
where did your , um , friend go ?
i &apos;m supposed to hit him up for some money for the fundraiser .
well , you should . he &apos;s loaded .
he &apos;s in good company .
some british guy just pledged to match ever dollar we raise .
what do you mean , british guy ?
you know , carol , when i think of them now ,
i think of an old fuddy duddy ,
but you really have changed my perception .
thank you .
you are just delightful .
what color are your eyes ?
they &apos;re blue .
they are .
look at what the cat dragged in .
nice vest .
well , thank you very much . good to see you , damon .
carol and i were just discussing whether
you &apos;d be tonight &apos;s other big benefactor .
what do you say , damon ?
klaus has made a very generous pledge .
you know how we &apos;re chomping at the bit to begin the renovation .
carol , don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but do you realize that you &apos;ve been kissing the ass
of an immoral hybrid who ruined your son &apos;s life ?
oh , come now . some might say i saved it ,
what all that nasty full moon business .
i never had to go through it myself
more than twice to be honest , but still ... i &apos;m very sympathetic .
klaus has promised to protect tyler , damon , and our town .
from who ? his hybrids are
the ones the town needs protection from .
well , i &apos;d have no use for them
if your brother would kindly return my family .
not gonna happen .
that &apos;s what i thought , which is why i &apos;ve come
to an agreement with the mayor .
you and the council stay out of my hair , i &apos;ll stay out of yours .
your town gets protected ,
hybrids get left alone and everybody will be happy .
all you have to do is to
get stefan to stop decapitating my friends .
please , damon . just get your brother under control
or the council will be forced to take action against him .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
oh , come on , mate , give peace a chance .
i need it more than you do , trust me .
caroline , what are you doing ?
hmm ? huh ? nothing .
ok , you &apos;re a bad sober liar .
you &apos;re an even worse drunk liar .
i might have texted tyler .
caroline .
what ? i &apos;m delicate .
give her a break .
you can &apos;t control what everyone does all the time .
ouch .
i &apos;m sorry . i know it &apos;s caroline &apos;s birthday ,
funeral or whatever , but ...
i just feel it &apos;s really
wrong that you compelled jeremy to leave town .
i &apos;m doing it to protect him , bonnie .
i want to give him a chance at a half @-@ way normal life .
he should be able to choose how he wants to live it .
you &apos;re taking his choices away .
bonnie , you can &apos;t tell him .
why ? are you gonna compel me not to ?
you know , you guys are ruining a perfectly good funeral .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just gonna go sleep it off or something .
happy birthday .
the mayor &apos;s looking out for tyler .
for now we have to assume klaus has her in his pocket .
oh , please don &apos;t tell me
you &apos;re going to drink the klaus kool @-@ aid .
i &apos;m not going to let him hold this town hostage .
but i &apos;m also not going to
let innocent people get caught in the crossfire
of a pissing contest between a hybrid and a vampire .
liz , i &apos;m impressed .
you &apos;re all strong and sherriff @-@ y .
i &apos;m not kidding , damon . get stefan to stand down
from this one before someone gets hurt .
what are you doing ? you &apos;re gonna ruin your career .
says the guy who got his job from his dad .
do you have any idea what you &apos;re messing with ?
i know what i &apos;m doing .
damn it , meredith .
back off , brian .
whoa . hey , is everything all right here ?
everything &apos;s fine .
it didn &apos;t look fine .
you might want to get to know her
before you become her white knight .
she &apos;s kind of a psycho case .
you &apos;re that guy , aren &apos;t you ?
the one begging to have his teeth kicked in .
take it from me , man , life &apos;s too short .
just go away , brian .
behold ... my senior prom date .
you definitely should have thrown him over the bridge .
unfortunately , i have to work with him .
he &apos;s on the council , the medical examiner .
the guy who signs his name under cause of death , &quot; animal attack . &quot;
i get it .
yeah .
duty calls .
thanks for the hero moment .
anytime .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
no dead hybrids at the founder &apos;s party .
no . i told klaus to get his hybrids out of town .
he didn &apos;t listen , so now i &apos;m saying it louder .
you don &apos;t think there &apos;s 10 more where that came from ?
and if you kill them , klaus won &apos;t make 20 more ?
have you forgotten about elena &apos;s part in all this
or do you not care if she &apos;s a human
blood bag for the rest of her life ?
protecting elena is your problem now .
see , i &apos;m not compelled by klaus to do it anymore .
don &apos;t give me that no humanity crap .
you can &apos;t just flip your switch .
your switch is fried , stefan , just like your brain .
you want to take klaus , you want to beat the villain ,
you got to be smarter .
to beat the villain , damon , you have to be the better villain .
sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to crash the party .
so don &apos;t .
no . it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s ok .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
it &apos;s kind of important .
are you ok ?
yeah . i want her to be happy , you know ?
that &apos;s what i want for all of you guys ,
in the middle of this crazy life you got stuck living .
is that how you see it ? that we &apos;re stuck ?
i &apos;d say its attached itself to all of you pretty tight , yeah .
bonnie &apos;s right .
you know , i have no business messing in jeremy &apos;s head .
i just didn &apos;t know what else to do .
he &apos;s in danger here .
i can &apos;t lose anyone else i love .
i take it all back .
everything i said this morning .
klaus can &apos;t control me .
not when it comes to you . i won &apos;t let him .
tyler , it &apos;s ok .
maybe we just weren &apos;t meant to be together .
maybe we just have to accept that and move on .
i &apos;m not moving on from anything .
i love you .
what ?
what just happened ?
oh , no .
did you--did you just bite me ?
oh , my god . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , my god !
oh , no . caroline ?
oh , my god .
caroline ?
just get away from me !
get away from me !
caroline ?
great .
we &apos;ve been abandoned .
ok , we &apos;re going into search party .
i don &apos;t trust that she won &apos;t get back together with him .
caroline ?
come on , caroline .
we don &apos;t have any more drinks .
matt &apos;s being haunted by the fell ghosts .
hello , damon .
she &apos;s a little busy right now .
why the hell do you have elena &apos;s phone ?
making my next move .
let me ask you something ,
what &apos;s klaus gonna do
if he can &apos;t make any more hybrids ?
what ?
stefan , leave her out of this .
what are you doing ?
stefan , let me out of this car !
do you hear me ? let me out of the car !
what now ?
you just pulled me away from a fascinating conversation
about landscaping the town square .
stefan just grabbed elena .
what ?
he &apos;s getting desperate .
he &apos;s gonna try to use her against you .
do what he says . get rid of your hybrids .
or what ? stefan would never dream of killing her .
are you sure about that ?
he just tried to behead someone in the middle of a council party .
he &apos;s operating on crazy right now .
well , crazy or not ,
that kind of love never dies .
he &apos;s bluffing .
maybe he is , maybe he isn &apos;t .
but if you don &apos;t want to believe him , believe me .
i know my brother better than anyone
and right now i don &apos;t have a clue
how far he &apos;s willing to take this .
so , if he says blink , i suggest you blink .
sheriff forbes !
what happened ?
tyler bit her .
oh , my god . sweetheart .
be careful .
oh , honey .
caroline ? honey , can you hear me ?
i &apos;m sorry , mom .
she &apos;s been hallucinating or something .
i don &apos;t know . no one &apos;s picking up their phone .
it &apos;s all right , sweetheart .
so , what &apos;s the plan , stefan ?
what &apos;s the big move you &apos;re making ?
i took klaus &apos; family to make him suffer .
i &apos;m not going to let him make himself more .
so , then what are you going to do , huh ?
are you going to lock me in some cave and keep me hostage ?
maybe i &apos;ll just turn you into a vampire .
stop the car , stefan !
stop the car , stefan !
stefan , how nice to hear your voice .
tell your hybrids to get out of town , klaus .
well , that &apos;s not going to happen until i get my coffins back .
ok . well , then i &apos;m going to drive
your blood source off wickery bridge .
i don &apos;t believe you , stefan .
you won &apos;t kill her .
no ! no ! no !
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i just fed her my blood .
no more hybrids if she &apos;s a vampire .
you won &apos;t do it .
really ?
try me because your coffins are next to go .
say good @-@ bye to your family , klaus .
stefan , slow down !
stefan , slow down ! stefan , stop it !
fine .
i &apos;ll send them away . you win .
stefan !
stefan , stop !
stop the car , stefan !
get back in the car .
stay away from me !
elena , get in the car .
how could you ? !
my parents died going over this bridge .
i almost died .
you knew that .
you &apos;re the one who saved me .
look , he had to believe that i would do it , all right ?
your fear sold it .
well , what if he hadn &apos;t ?
he did .
well , what if he hadn &apos;t ?
he did , elena ! he backed down !
he has a weakness !
if i know his weakness , i can destroy him !
after everything , that &apos;s what mattered ,
destroying klaus ?
destroying klaus is all i have left .
you had me !
i lost you the minute i left town with him .
you just haven &apos;t let yourself admit that .
is that what you &apos;re doing ?
trying to make me hate you ?
i don &apos;t really care what you think about me anymore , elena .
tyler came to see me .
poor boy , he seemed quite distressed .
he said caroline had had a terrible accident .
you made him do this to her .
he would have never done something like this .
i &apos;m here to help , matt .
my blood will heal her .
please ask the sheriff to invite me inside .
i know how this game works .
you want something in return .
just your support .
come in .
are you going to kill me ?
on your birthday ?
do you really think that low of me ?
yes .
oh , that looks bad .
my apologies .
you &apos;re what &apos;s known as collateral damage .
it &apos;s nothing personal .
i love birthdays .
aren &apos;t you like ... a billion or something ?
we have to adjust your perception
of time when you become a vampire , caroline .
celebrate the fact that
you &apos;re no longer bound by trivial human conventions .
you &apos;re free .
no .
i &apos;m dying .
and i could let you die ...
if that &apos;s what you want .
if you really believe your existence has no meaning .
i &apos;ve thought about it myself
once or twice
over the centuries , truth be told .
but i &apos;ll let you in on a little secret .
there &apos;s a whole world out there
waiting for you ,
great cities and art and music ...
genuine beauty .
and you can have all of it .
you can have a thousand more birthdays .
all you have to do is ask .
i don &apos;t want to die .
there you go , sweetheart .
have at it .
happy birthday , caroline .
thanks for picking me up .
anytime .
are you going to be ok ?
i &apos;ll survive .
somehow i always do .
you know , stefan won this round for us today .
he pushed klaus over the edge .
klaus blinked .
well , his methods sucked .
still , we needed it .
klaus has been calling all the shots
and stefan beat him at his own game .
he was the better villain .
don &apos;t sound so impressed .
well , can &apos;t help but feel a little proud .
really , tell me , are you going to be ok ?
you can &apos;t kiss me again .
i know .
i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not right .
it &apos;s right .
just not right now .
good night .
good night , damon .
you &apos;re gonna have to let me go eventually .
be safe , ok ?
yeah , ok , all right .
alaric &apos;s waiting .
good , you haven &apos;t left yet .
hey , what are you doing here ?
i came to say good @-@ bye .
you &apos;re not going to jump , are you ?
thanks for coming .
i was just thinking about what you said ,
about us being stuck .
i was buzzed , elena .
i can &apos;t be held responsible for being judgmental .
i do feel stuck , matt .
i feel like ... i &apos;ve been holding on to the girl
that was supposed to die here with her parents .
the girl that had a normal life
and didn &apos;t fall in love with vampires .
you &apos;re not that girl anymore .
it &apos;s ok if you want to let her go .
is it ?
because i feel like
i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve disappointed her a little , like ...
like i &apos;ve disappointed them , my parents .
my 2 cents ...
as a guy who knew that little girl ,
you &apos;re doing a lot better than you think .
here lies elena gilbert ,
a fun girlfriend ...
and an amazing friend .
thank god . another day @-@ drinker .
i lost a patient .
what &apos;s your excuse ?
uh , well , i put a kid on a plane .
yours ?
no , that &apos;s a long story .
then you should probably buy me a beer .
a hiker called it in .
my guys got here first .
another hybrid ?
