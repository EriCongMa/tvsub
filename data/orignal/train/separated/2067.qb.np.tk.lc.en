rachel , it &apos;s professor dunbar .
i was wondering if you &apos;d be interested in helping me
with the innocence project .
you want me to help you get an innocent man off death row ?
what do you want , harvey ?
help me protect mike ross .
he &apos;s in there with a guy i put away ,
and the guy is no joke .
what am i supposed to do ?
you &apos;re supposed to move the guy to another prison .
you want me one @-@ on @-@ one ? you got it .
i &apos;m gonna use this , and they &apos;re gonna hold you .
no !
what &apos;s going on here ?
why &apos;d you come back with a guard ?
i didn &apos;t do it to get you to forgive me .
i never should have let him in here in the first place .
the time you served while awaiting trial
was never factored into your sentence .
you &apos;re eligible for parole in six weeks .
you think i don &apos;t know this is your protector &apos;s idea
to get me off your back ?
nah , frank .
harvey &apos;s idea was for me to tell these guys that you &apos;re an informant .
i figured out a way to get mike out early .
what &apos;s the catch ?
he has to inform on his roommate .
mike gets him to turn , he &apos;s free .
when do you need an answer by ?
yesterday .
and the answer needs to be yes .
harvey , wait a second .
where are you going ?
where do you think i &apos;m going ?
i &apos;m gonna see mike .
and i know what you &apos;re going to say ,
but mike went to prison so we wouldn &apos;t have to ,
and now he &apos;s in danger from a guy i put away .
so you &apos;ll forgive me if i don &apos;t stand around and wait
for you to drop the hammer .
you think i like the idea of him rotting in that place ?
but if you want this thing to work ,
you can &apos;t go running up there in the middle of the night .
you heard cahill . he needs an answer yesterday .
what he needs is results .
and if mike &apos;s lawyer pulls him out of his cell
in the middle of the night , then his roommate
is going to sense there &apos;s something wrong
before this thing even gets started .
fine , but i &apos;m going up there first thing in the morning ,
and nothing you say is going to stop me .
can &apos;t sleep ?
not really .
well , as long as you &apos;re up ,
might want to think about putting up some pictures of your own
that way yon won &apos;t have to keep staring at mine .
how old are they ?
maddy is seven .
nate just turned five .
they look really sweet .
yeah ... they &apos;re great .
how often do you get to see &apos; em ?
i don &apos;t .
what do you mean you don &apos;t ?
bad divorce or something ?
nah , nah , nothing like that .
we &apos;ve been married for ten years .
i just--i just don &apos;t let &apos; em come here .
what ? why not ?
they shouldn &apos;t see their father as a criminal .
kevin , come on , man .
i know it &apos;s hard on them .
it tears me up every single day that i &apos;m here .
but they &apos;re kids . they &apos;re resilient .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
well , mike , you don &apos;t have kids .
so you don &apos;t know .
no . i don &apos;t .
but i do know what it &apos;s like to be a kid missing his dad .
please don &apos;t tell me your old man abandoned the family .
both of my parents died in a car accident when i was 11 .
hit by a drunk driver .
jesus , that &apos;s ... i &apos;m sorry , mike .
yeah , it was a long time ago .
kevin , i understand the instinct to protect your children ,
but what are you protecting them from ?
what do you mean ?
i mean we &apos;ve been roommates for a while now .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time you told me what you &apos;re in here for ?
hey , ross .
your lawyer &apos;s here .
now ?
i &apos;m just the messenger .
you want out of this box or not ?
mr. bailey , my name is rachel zane .
i am a law student at columbia ,
and i &apos;m here to talk to you about your case .
student ?
yes , we work alongside the innocence project
to determine if you have the criteria for an appeal .
do you know how long i &apos;ve been sittin &apos; on death row ?
12 years . i read your file .
and for the last ten of &apos; em , i &apos;ve been writing letters
and begging any lawyer to listen to my story .
and they finally get around to getting back to me ,
and they don &apos;t even have the courtesy
of sendin &apos; me a real lawyer ?
mr. bailey , trust me , i will fight for you .
you &apos;re a student .
you can &apos;t do shit for me .
well , you know what ? you killed two people .
in cold blood .
you know it , and i know it ,
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re in there ,
so thank you for making the decision
to not take your case an easy one .
you don &apos;t know me .
all you know is what you read in some damn file .
i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
i &apos;ve been saying it for 12 years
and i can prove it .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t know you .
and you don &apos;t know me either .
so do you want to take a chance on each other or not ?
i need help , ms. zane .
so let me help you .
harvey , what are you doing here ?
there &apos;s something i need to talk to you about .
sit down .
what is it ?
i just got a visit from sean cahill .
about gallo ?
i thought you said he can &apos;t get him transferred .
he can &apos;t , but it turns out
there &apos;s a way he can get you out .
what do you mean &quot; out &quot; ?
i mean out ,
as in you walk out that front door
and you never look back .
what &apos;s the catch ?
mike--
harvey , you &apos;re not here telling me that i can get out
with that look on your face
if there isn &apos;t something else .
he needs you to inform on your cellmate .
what ?
if whatever you get leads to a conviction on his father @-@ in @-@ law ,
he &apos;ll commute your sentence and you get to walk .
what &apos;d the guy do ?
who cares what he did ?
i care , because if it was so bad ,
why didn &apos;t kevin turn on him in the first place ?
mike , what does it matter ?
he can get you out .
this is my only friend in here .
i &apos;m not gonna betray him .
friend ? listen to me , god damn it .
there &apos;s someone in here trying to kill you
and i &apos;m giving you a way out .
i &apos;m taking care of gallo .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
it means that i did what you told me to do .
i threatened to tell people that he was an informant ,
but what i also did was found out a way to get him parole .
parole ? are you crazy ?
he &apos;s not gonna get parole .
who &apos;s gonna say he deserves it ?
you know what , harvey ?
instead of coming here and telling me to betray my cellmate
because gallo will never get parole ,
maybe you should be helping me get it for him .
i &apos;m never helping that piece of shit do anything ,
and this isn &apos;t about gallo and you know it .
no , it &apos;s about you telling me to turn on the one guy in here that i trust
based on some plan that cahill has
that we don &apos;t even know will work .
no , mike .
it &apos;s about giving you a chance to get your life back
while it still looks the same .
now , are you going to take it or not ?
son of a bitch , it &apos;s the prune juice all over again .
what the ?
hey , douche stick .
are you responsible for my mugs being here ?
i didn &apos;t--i don &apos;t--
we didn &apos;t have anything else to use .
i don &apos;t give a shit !
take those things and put &apos; em back where--
well , if it isn &apos;t louis shit .
what &apos;s happening , boss ?
you bastard .
you took my mugs ,
and you didn &apos;t even have the balls to do it yourself .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about ,
but if something of yours is in here ,
it had nothing to do with me .
really ? why don &apos;t you ask the stuttering ass clown ?
we needed them for our ...
urine tests .
what &apos;d you say ?
you peed on my catch phrase ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s funnier--
you got a catch phrase or that we peed on it .
i want those mugs sterilized and i want &apos; em destroyed .
they &apos;re your mugs , you do what you want ,
but i &apos;m not touching &apos; em with a ten @-@ foot pole .
you know how much asparagus luterman eats ?
later , chief .
how &apos;d it go this morning ?
i was petrified .
death row . how could you not be ?
it &apos;s not just that .
when i got there , it hit me
that if i do this ,
i have a man &apos;s life in my hands .
rachel , you can handle it .
i know i can .
then why do i get the feeling that something is bothering you ?
because when i got back from there ,
i was so angry about what happened to that poor man
that i sat down , i started working on this case ,
and i-- i haven &apos;t moved since .
i don &apos;t understand . why is that bad ?
because it &apos;s the first time since mike left
that i haven &apos;t thought about him every second .
listen to me .
that &apos;s a good thing .
it doesn &apos;t feel like a good thing .
rachel , you can &apos;t live your life on pins and needles .
it &apos;s not healthy for you .
it &apos;s not healthy for mike . it &apos;s not healthy for anyone .
and forgetting about him is healthy ?
isn &apos;t that why you took this case ?
to give yourself something to focus on ?
yes , but i just--
then don &apos;t fight it .
if working to free an innocent man helps you
to forget about mike for a while ,
he would be the first person to tell you to do it .
and trust me ,
if you really lose yourself in this ,
i have a feeling it &apos;s gonna seem like a lot less than two years
before he gets out .
where &apos;s harvey ?
harvey &apos;s not here .
well , get his ass in here
because he made some goddamn side deal
with those traders and i want them out .
louis , i am telling you , now is not the time .
and i am telling you that i cannot look at
their smug , stupid faces for one more day .
maybe you don &apos;t have to look at them .
what are you talking about ?
louis , did i ever tell you
about my first apartment in the city ?
no .
i was sharing a 400 square @-@ foot studio
and it was a disaster until we finally decided
that we had to separate our spaces for privacy .
well , this isn &apos;t &quot; the brady bunch , &quot; donna .
we can &apos;t put a masking tape line down the center of the office .
i &apos;m not talking about masking tape , louis .
i am talking about hiring an architect
to reconfigure the offices .
you &apos;re right !
we can even do a remodel ,
which is what i &apos;ve been wanting to do for the last five years .
and the best part is , you don &apos;t have to deal with
those asshole traders ever again .
donna , you &apos;re a genius .
i know .
get me the names of six architects before lunch .
louis , you have your own secretary .
thanks for nothing .
why do i even ?
nice of you to show up .
been peeling these potatoes by myself .
sorry , i ... got caught up .
speaking of which , how &apos;d it go with your lawyer ?
you gettin &apos; out of here ?
what ?
i &apos;m just kidding . so what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
it &apos;s not important .
your lawyer shows up without you knowing about it
and it &apos;s not important ?
come on , do i look like i was born yesterday ?
i just said it is not important .
and i &apos;m sorry i left you hanging ,
but you wouldn &apos;t even have this job without me .
i wouldn &apos;t even need this job if it weren &apos;t for you .
so what &apos;s your problem ?
i &apos;m sorry , kevin , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m just not having a good day .
hey , it &apos;s okay .
don &apos;t sweat it . all right ?
i mean , it &apos;s none of my business anyway .
no , actually , it is your business .
he came here to tell me that he tried to get gallo transferred ,
but ... it &apos;s not gonna happen .
well , as long as we stick together ,
we can deal with gallo anyway , right ?
yeah , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s what i told harvey .
right .
next time you talk to him , tell him i said thanks for trying .
how &apos;d it go ?
he said he had to think about it .
what ? why ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s an idiot , that &apos;s why .
so what &apos;re you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna figure out how to buy us some time .
well , you better do it fast because cahill &apos;s in your office
and he wants an answer .
sean .
what &apos;d he say ?
said he wants to see the details in writing .
i &apos;m not in the mood , harvey .
and i &apos;m not messing around .
please tell me you &apos;re kidding me .
oh , come on , this is bullshit .
you know my word is good .
yeah , and i told him that ,
and he doesn &apos;t want to risk putting a target on his back
and then find out commuting his sentence
really means cutting it in half .
he &apos;s not risking anything .
no one &apos;s gonna find out .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s exactly what frank gallo thought .
so either put it in writing or we don &apos;t have a deal .
he didn &apos;t go for it , did he ?
what are you talking about ?
mike being at risk has nothing to do
with putting anything in writing .
and you told me he wouldn &apos;t go for it ,
so harvey ... tell me the truth .
all right , he said no .
but sean , i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;ll come around .
he just needs a couple of days .
do you know how many strings i pulled
to put this thing in motion ?
what i know is , you wouldn &apos;t have pulled anything
if this case wasn &apos;t huge for you .
so instead of yelling at me
for saying that it &apos;s gonna take a couple days ,
why don &apos;t you just give me a couple of days ?
okay , harvey .
the deal &apos;s still on the table .
but if i find a way to move forward without his help ,
there is no deal and he does the whole two years .
jessica .
harvey .
what &apos;s going on with mike ?
i gave him cahill &apos;s offer .
and he &apos;s thinking about it ?
i &apos;m working on it .
well , in the meantime , while you were out ,
i got a call from nathan burns .
he thinks someone &apos;s trying to take over his company .
why the hell would he think of that ?
because word on the street is ,
someone &apos;s selling off a block of his stock .
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
we bought sutter &apos;s shares from him .
those goddamn traders .
no way .
they wouldn &apos;t do that without telling me .
they bought it in good faith .
well , they &apos;re dumping it in bad faith .
i &apos;ll take care of it--
no .
you have your hands full with mike .
i can handle this .
jessica , it was my idea to involve them .
i should be the one to take care of it .
i don &apos;t care whose idea it was , harvey .
you take care of mike .
hello ?
you have a call from danbury federal prison .
do you accept the charges ?
yes , of course .
mike , is everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
i was just thinking about you .
i was thinking about you too .
you were ?
yes , in fact , i was just in the middle
of a heated discussion with you
about the best way to handle a death row appeal .
i don &apos;t understand .
i took on an innocence project case ,
just to have something to take my mind off of our troubles .
but i ... i didn &apos;t want to take my mind off of you .
so i figured i would just imagine we were working on it together .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
say you &apos;re in .
i mean , that depends on what strategy we landed on .
mike , seriously , is there something wrong ?
no , i just wanted to make sure you were doing okay .
and that ... that we were still good .
now that i have something to take my mind off our situation
and connect me to you at the same time ,
yeah , we &apos;re better than good .
all right , can you do me a favor and transfer me to donna ?
of course . can i ask why ?
i only get one phone call ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure she had something to do
with the idea of you imagining us working together ,
so i just want to thank her .
okay . i love you .
i love you too .
hello ?
donna , i have mike on the phone .
put him through .
hello ?
donna .
if harvey &apos;s there , do me a favor--
keep your voice down , and don &apos;t tell him it &apos;s me .
mike , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m not taking the deal , donna .
are you crazy ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
what &apos;s not simple about it ? harvey said that if you--
i don &apos;t care what harvey said .
because what he didn &apos;t say
is that if i do what he wants and someone finds out ,
then i may never get back to rachel at all .
harvey would never let them find out--
donna , look , i called you
so that i didn &apos;t want to have this argument with him .
now , i don &apos;t have much time .
are you gonna do this for me or not ?
i &apos;ll tell him .
then i also need you to tell him something else for me .
if he comes here to try to change my mind ,
i &apos;m not gonna see him .
you mind telling me who the hell said
you can dump nathan burns &apos; stock without talking to us ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
who &apos;s nathan burns ?
ceo of exodyne .
oh , that nathan burns .
in that case , i said i could sell that stock
because i own it .
just like i own this one and this one and this one .
look at that , my neubacher capital position &apos;s
going through the roof .
that &apos;s not the deal you made with harvey and you know it .
welcome to the big , bad world of wall street .
now , do you want something or can i get back to work ?
i want something .
you &apos;re going to unwind that sale and buy those shares back .
at a premium ? not gonna happen .
i &apos;m your landlord .
and the fact you had to lease to me
means you don &apos;t have much of an operation .
you listen to me , you little pissant .
you don &apos;t know who you &apos;re messing with .
then why don &apos;t i find out ?
over dinner ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
you want me to have dinner with you
in exchange for backing off that trade ?
i think of it as you get to have dinner with me
and i choose to back off that trade
&apos;cause i am a standup guy .
well , let me let you in on a little something there , stu .
i don &apos;t share dinner staring down the barrel of a shotgun .
so why don &apos;t you unwind that trade and then ask me out ?
and then we &apos;ll see if you &apos;re as charming
as you like to think you are .
you know what ? i am charming .
but i &apos;m not an idiot .
and i &apos;m not unwinding my trade
without getting something in return .
harvey , i need to talk to you about something
and you &apos;re not going to like it .
about what ?
that was mike on the phone before .
why didn &apos;t you get me ?
he &apos;s not taking the deal , harvey .
the hell he isn &apos;t .
where are you going ?
to that prison .
harvey , the reason he called me and not you
is because he knew you wouldn &apos;t take no for an answer .
and i &apos;m not going to .
which is why he said if you show up there ,
he &apos;s not gonna leave his cell .
then get me rachel .
no , no , harvey , you cannot tell her .
like hell i can &apos;t .
she &apos;s the only one who can convince him .
if you tell her that mike &apos;s not taking a deal
that can get him out ,
it &apos;ll tear her apart .
and if i don &apos;t tell her ,
he &apos;s gonna be in there for two more years .
is that what she wants ?
that &apos;s between them .
that &apos;s why i want to tell her .
she &apos;ll make it between them .
harvey .
god damn it , he plays checkers with this guy
and thinks he owes him his life .
no , that &apos;s not fair and you know it ,
because mike &apos;s loyalty is the reason you &apos;re not in prison .
that &apos;s what &apos;s killing me , donna ,
don &apos;t you understand ?
he &apos;s in there instead of me
with a guy i put away ,
and i can &apos;t just sit here doing nothing
when he has a chance to get out .
which is why you have to think of something else .
because if you tell rachel about this ,
the life that &apos;s waiting for mike when he gets out ...
it isn &apos;t going to be there .
harvey . i &apos;m surprised to see you here so soon .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d turn him this fast .
i need more time .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
i &apos;m being pressured to move to another investigation .
you &apos;ve got 24 hours to change his mind or this thing is done .
then i need you to do something for me .
i am doing something for you .
i &apos;m getting mike out of prison .
well , you need to do something else for me
or that &apos;s never gonna happen .
what are you talking about ?
i need you to get into a room with him
because he won &apos;t listen to what i have to say .
what exactly do you want me to tell him
that you haven &apos;t already ?
sean , mike &apos;s a bleeding heart .
you need to make the case directly to him .
he needs to see the victims of whatever the hell this guy did .
that &apos;s a swell idea , harvey ,
but if i go into that prison and someone sees me ,
not only are we dead in the water ,
but mike &apos;s life isn &apos;t worth shit .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
what the hell do you think i &apos;m doing here ?
what are you talking about ?
i have a plan .
but you &apos;re not gonna like it .
why not ?
because i need you to pull another string ,
and i need you to do it before
frank gallo tries something else with mike .
all right , fake lawyer .
let &apos;s see what you got .
you &apos;re gonna let me look into it for you ?
look into it ? shit .
you &apos;re gonna get me out of here like you promised .
i never promised .
i said there was an excellent chance
that you could get--
six weeks , brother .
i &apos;ll be counting the days .
i &apos;ll file the motion first thing in the morning .
there you go .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
and if i find out you &apos;re screwing me on any level ,
you better hole up in some dark corner of this prison ,
pray to god i don &apos;t find your ass .
what was that all about ?
looks like he took me up on my offer after all .
god damn it , gretchen , where the hell is she ?
where the hell is who ?
that architect you were supposed to call .
she &apos;s not supposed to be here for another half hour .
and if i want someone &apos;s business ,
i show up a half @-@ hour early at the latest .
and what exactly are you looking to have me do
about your little conundrum ?
i want you to give her a call
and tell her if she doesn &apos;t have the goddamn common courtesy
to show up early ,
then she might as well not show up at all .
mr. litt .
i--
y @-@ yes ?
i &apos;m tara messer .
i &apos;m here to discuss your remodel needs .
my needs ?
well , i &apos;m sorry , ms. was @-@ going @-@ to @-@ be @-@ our @-@ architect .
we no longer need your service .
gretchen , calm down .
you are overreacting like a crazy woman .
you &apos;re hired .
i am ?
oh , yeah . you &apos;re right for the job .
i can feel it .
you can feel something , all right .
then why don &apos;t we start with
what you &apos;re looking for in the space ?
space .
right , the space . exactly .
what i &apos;m looking for are clear yet unobtrusive boundaries
between our offices and the tenants &apos; .
but it needs to be elegant and organic
or we might as well not do it at all .
i understand .
like the perfect aria leading seamlessly
to its inevitable cadenza .
you &apos;re an opera lover ?
second only to the ballet .
then i suggest we start with a marriage .
i mean a tour .
excuse me , professor dunbar .
do you have a moment ?
this is the faculty lounge , ms. zane .
you &apos;re not supposed to be in here .
i understand that , and i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just this is important and you weren &apos;t in your office .
what can i do for you ?
i met with leonard bailey yesterday .
he &apos;s the inmate on death--
i know who he is .
is there a problem ?
yes , there is .
he &apos;s rotting on death row for a crime that he didn &apos;t commit .
so you met with him for ten minutes
and you &apos;re ready to release him ?
no , what i &apos;m saying is--
you &apos;re a second @-@ year law student , rachel .
i asked you to be a part of this
because you &apos;re one of my brightest students ,
but i also asked you in particular
because i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be so naive .
excuse me ?
your job wasn &apos;t to talk to mr. bailey once
and , after being moved by his tale of woe ,
tell me to jump him to the top of the pile .
it was to assess his case and present evidence .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m doing here .
i just left two boxes of textbook prosecutorial misconduct
with your secretary .
you found all of that since yesterday ?
yes , because while i may only be a second @-@ year law student ,
i have been a practicing paralegal for the past eight years .
looks like i have some reading to do .
i &apos;m sorry for interrupting your day .
good afternoon , ms. zane .
good afternoon , professor .
and then we use the glass motif you already have
to partition their space from yours
starting at that wall over there .
and no one ever knows they &apos;re two separate entities .
and if we use the frosted glass ,
you &apos;ll never even have to lay eyes on them .
well , there &apos;s just one more thing .
you want to know
if i can design another bullpen area for your side .
after all , it &apos;s the heart and soul of the space .
you get that ?
it &apos;s my job to get that .
i don &apos;t understand .
to me , architecture isn &apos;t just about design .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s about connecting with my clients
on an intimate level .
well , you &apos;re very good at it .
and you know , it &apos;s too bad
you already sublet to someone else .
we &apos;re looking to expand ourselves .
this space would have been perfect .
are you serious ?
yeah .
in fact , it &apos;s so perfect ,
i would have made you an offer on the spot .
anyway , i &apos;ll have some plans drawn up as soon as i can .
we need to get rid of those traders .
excuse me ?
i don &apos;t care what kind of deal
you and harvey cut with them .
we need to get rid of them
and we need to do it now .
well , louis , i &apos;m not going to do that
because whoever we replace them with ,
this conversation is just going to happen again .
because we both know that you &apos;re out of your mind .
it &apos;s not gonna happen again
because in this particular case , i am not out of my mind .
why do you want me to do this ?
because i &apos;m in love with an architect .
let me get this straight .
you want me to further antagonize people
that i &apos;m already fighting with
because you don &apos;t have the balls
to ask a woman out on a date ?
that &apos;s one way of looking at it .
no , there &apos;s another way .
the answer is no .
okay , fine .
i &apos;ll just stick to the original plan
of having her completely redesign our space ,
and i &apos;ll just make sure it takes long enough
for her to fall madly in love with me ,
and it shouldn &apos;t take more than two or three years .
louis , i want you to look at me when i say this .
if you hire this woman to do anything
relating to this firm &apos;s space ,
i will personally throw you off the roof this building .
is that clear ?
so you &apos;ll think about it ?
get out .
ahnold .
come on . let &apos;s see what you got .
i didn &apos;t know you played .
played ? shit .
i set the p.s. 092 single @-@ game scoring record .
p.s. 092 is an elementary school , my friend .
yeah , sixth grade . i dominated .
heard you had to file that motion for gallo &apos;s parole .
i did .
already ?
it was an 18 @-@ page sentencing amendment .
i could do that in my sleep .
i should get you to do some work for me .
why ? you need some ?
no , but if i did , i &apos;d probably get myself a lawyer
who didn &apos;t sleep in a prison .
you all right ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know .
what do you mean , you don &apos;t know ?
what is it , your stomach ?
my god , something &apos;s not right .
take a deep breath .
put your head down .
god , i can &apos;t-- that &apos;s not gonna do anything .
i think ...
my god , i think somebody
did something to me .
can i get some help over here ?
guard !
mike , talk to me .
it &apos;s gallo .
yeah , he must &apos;ve put something in my--
somebody do something ! guard !
call harvey .
guard !
mike . mike !
where is he ?
if i knew who you were talking about , maybe i could--
mike ross . i need to see him right now .
and who are you ?
harvey specter . i &apos;m his attorney .
mr. ross is in the infirmary ,
but you can &apos;t see him in there .
then get me the warden .
i don &apos;t appreciate being pushed around , mr. specter .
i don &apos;t care .
i want everyone to know what happened here today .
they saw what happened .
yeah , there &apos;s a difference between seeing and knowing .
you kevin miller ?
who are you ?
harvey specter .
i &apos;m mike ross &apos;s lawyer .
look , i already told the warden
i didn &apos;t see anyone touch his food .
did you see frank gallo with him ?
did you or didn &apos;t you ?
are you trying to get me killed , man ?
did he touch his food or not ?
yeah , he did , last night at dinner .
but mike offered to get gallo parole
and gallo took him up on it , so why would he poison him ?
because he didn &apos;t really take mike up on that offer .
he just did it to get close to him .
or he did it to give mike a taste of what happens
if he doesn &apos;t come through .
either way , you stay the hell away from that son of a bitch .
all right , that &apos;s enough . let &apos;s go .
counselor !
i heard your boy had a little tummy ache out in the yard .
you piece of shit .
you goddamn poisoned him .
guards , get him out of here .
i didn &apos;t do shit .
why don &apos;t you come over here and say that to my face ?
you think i won &apos;t ?
god damn it .
i said get him back to his cell !
this wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
we talked about you seeing his roommate ,
not rushing frank gallo .
yeah , my guy &apos;s lying unconscious in the infirmary .
so sue me .
how did you know gallo would take the bait ?
because he &apos;s an animal , and animals always take the bait .
i &apos;ll give you credit for knowing how it would go down .
i don &apos;t need credit .
i need to know where mike ross is .
where i was instructed to put him .
let me tell you something , mr. specter ,
i don &apos;t know you .
so in case you &apos;re thinking of trying anything ,
that kid has a monitor on his leg ,
and if it goes dark for even one second ,
i &apos;m gonna make sure that you end up in a cell here with him .
it &apos;s not gonna go dark ,
and he &apos;ll be back here when i said he would .
then after that , i &apos;m gonna make sure
he gets out of here . for good .
how you feeling ?
what &apos;s going on ?
where am i ?
you &apos;re in the back of my car .
you were drugged .
by gallo .
by me .
what ?
cahill got the warden and the prison doctor
to put something in your food .
they &apos;re the only ones who know what &apos;s going on .
what the hell are you talking about ?
we needed to change your mind about taking this deal ,
and we couldn &apos;t do it as long as you &apos;re in there .
jesus christ .
so you drugged me ?
we needed a cover for why you &apos;re not in your cell ,
and this was the only way to do it .
are you insane ?
you broke me out of prison ?
i didn &apos;t break you out of anywhere .
cahill sanctioned it .
and if anyone &apos;s insane , it &apos;s you , &apos; cause you &apos;re the one
turning down a chance to get out of that place .
but we don &apos;t have time to talk about that right now .
cahill &apos;s waiting for us .
you got me out to see cahill ?
i said he &apos;s waiting .
i didn &apos;t say that &apos;s where i &apos;m taking you .
then where the hell are you taking me ?
you think me spending a couple of hours with rachel
is gonna change my mind ?
if it doesn &apos;t , there &apos;s something wrong with you .
so , you gonna yell at me ?
or you gonna take the only chance you &apos;re gonna get
to be alone with the woman you love
for the next two years ?
please tell me that you did not tell her
about cahill &apos;s offer .
i wanted to .
but you have donna to thank for the fact that i didn &apos;t .
what am i supposed to tell rachel about why i &apos;m here ?
if it were me , i &apos;d tell her the truth .
now , since you don &apos;t want to do that ,
you &apos;re lucky i came up with something else .
wait till it hits 30 and then sell .
look who it is .
you change your mind about my offer ?
i &apos;m not there just yet .
but i did come to apologize .
i didn &apos;t mean to be so combative before .
you &apos;re a proud woman . i understand . bygones .
you know , your operation here is kind of impressive .
mind if i look at one ?
you can take a look at anything of mine you want .
now , what does that line right there mean ?
what the hell , that &apos;s my neubacher capital position .
it seems to be falling very quickly .
is that a good thing ?
you did this .
i &apos;m not sure what you mean .
all i did this afternoon
was call my friend at jacobson kearney
and have them issue a press release
about their client &apos;s merger negotiations .
i mean , how was i supposed to know that it would make
your neubacher position fall through the floor ?
you used the information i gave you yesterday
about my holdings , that &apos;s how .
that &apos;s inside information , and i can prove it .
no , it could have been ,
if your attorney hadn &apos;t filed your position with the sec
ten days earlier than he had to .
i &apos;m not gonna forget this .
good , because my operation &apos;s been around
a hell of a lot longer than yours ,
and we can be friends or we can be enemies .
but you mess with me again
and i &apos;ll not only kick you out of these offices ,
i &apos;ll put you in the ground .
rachel .
how ?
harvey .
i don &apos;t understand .
i know you know about frank gallo .
but what you don &apos;t know
is that they put me in solitary confinement for 36 hours .
oh my god .
it &apos;s okay .
i was safe .
then harvey made them watch the video ,
which showed that i was only defending myself .
turns out they were more than happy to trade
six hours and an ankle bracelet to avoid a lawsuit .
we only have six hours ?
yeah , and i don &apos;t want to waste any of it .
mr. litt , what are you--
please , call me louis .
what can i do for you , louis ?
tara , i &apos;m afraid i have some bad news .
we &apos;re not gonna be moving forward
with the renovations after all .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
no , it has nothing to do with you .
and of course i will pay you out of my own pocket
for any of the work you &apos;ve already done .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
please , tara , i insist .
in that case , i might as well at least
show you what i had in mind .
as you can see , these are just rough drawings .
not to me .
here &apos;s the frosted glass wall curving in an elegant &quot; s &quot;
that separates the space .
it &apos;s beautiful .
that &apos;s not even the best part .
because i know how important the new bullpen is to you ,
i modeled it after the kimmel center in philadelphia ,
and i enclosed the entire space--
in mahogany .
it would have been exquisite .
but some things weren &apos;t meant to be .
yeah .
how would you feel about renovating my summer house
in the hamptons ?
i appreciate the thought ,
louis , but i don &apos;t do residential work .
it &apos;s not residential . i use it as a home office .
but it would be so small .
no , i want the entire house to be
a satellite division of the firm .
are you sure ?
i &apos;ve never been as sure of anything in my entire life .
then i look forward to working with you , louis .
sean , what can i do for you ?
where the hell are they ?
what ?
i &apos;ve been sitting in my office
for two hours waiting for them .
where the hell are they ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe they &apos;re caught in traffic .
listen to me , i can contact the prison
and find out exactly where they are .
but i do that , it starts a tornado of shit
with your boss in the eye of the storm .
so you &apos;re gonna tell me right now
what the hell they &apos;re up to .
he &apos;s waiting for mike outside of his apartment .
waiting for him to do what ?
he &apos;s with rachel .
you got to be kidding me .
i didn &apos;t pull in every favor i have so mike ross
could have some conjugal visit .
no , you pulled in every favor you had
so that harvey could convince mike to do what you wanted
and this is gonna make that happen .
by getting him laid ?
by reminding him of what he &apos;s missing out on
if he doesn &apos;t take your deal .
that wasn &apos;t the plan .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna go down there and do
what we said we were gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna show mike the innocent people
that lost everything because of that bastard .
sean , please , if you do that ,
rachel will find out about everything
and that can &apos;t happen .
why not ?
because mike chose prison over her once ,
and if he does it again , she &apos;ll never forgive him .
mike &apos;s problem . not mine .
no , that &apos;s harvey &apos;s problem .
he promised mike he wouldn &apos;t tell her ,
and harvey &apos;s a man of his word .
if he were a man of his word , he would be here right now .
so what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna do what should &apos;ve been done
in the first place .
i &apos;m gonna tell mike &apos;s fiancée
that he has a chance to get out
but he doesn &apos;t want to take it .
you want to tell me what that was all about ?
harvey and cahill got mike out of prison
to convince him to take the deal ,
and harvey brought mike to rachel instead of to sean .
he broke mike out of prison ?
is he crazy ?
it sounded crazy to me at first too ,
but harvey &apos;s living with the guilt of putting mike in there
and cahill was willing to do it , so can you blame him ?
no . i can &apos;t .
but i want to know how this whole thing shakes out .
and i want to know tonight .
what time is it ?
we still have time .
my god .
i fell asleep .
you did .
why didn &apos;t you wake me ?
because you looked so peaceful .
rachel , i don &apos;t want us to waste--
we &apos;re not wasting anything .
mike , i don &apos;t know how well you sleep in there ,
so to be able to give you this ...
thank you .
can i cook you something ?
i &apos;ll make you anything you want .
no , i just want us to lie here and stare at each other .
not say anything .
god .
you &apos;re so beautiful .
i thought you wanted us to be quiet .
couldn &apos;t help it .
you know , you always tell me how beautiful i am .
you never give me a chance to tell you how handsome
i think you are .
i thought you loved me for my mind .
i do .
but that doesn &apos;t mean
that i don &apos;t also think you &apos;re handsome .
mike , what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
does it have something to do with why you &apos;re really here ?
because i didn &apos;t believe what you told me earlier .
why didn &apos;t you say something ?
because you &apos;re here , so i didn &apos;t care .
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;m unwinding my position with nathan burns &apos; company .
i appreciate that .
but i don &apos;t need to take home the paper trail .
it &apos;s not a paper trail .
it &apos;s an engagement letter .
turns out my attorney was filing my positions
before he had to ,
so i let him go .
you want me to take you as a client .
if you &apos;ll have me .
on one condition .
i hear you &apos;ve been having fun with louis litt .
but it stops now .
done .
i should have known the guy who hired a fraud like that
would pull a stunt like this .
this stunt is gonna get youexactly what you want .
no , harvey .
i &apos;m gonna get what i want
by telling that kid &apos;s fiancée the truth
and letting her do the work for me .
listen to me , sean .
she doesn &apos;t know
because he doesn &apos;t want her to know .
i don &apos;t give a shit what he wants .
then trust me , this is the only way
to get what you want .
trust you ? you lied to my face .
i made a judgment call .
then look me in the eye
and tell me you didn &apos;t make that call
before you asked me to get him out .
i knew it .
the whole time you were always gonna bring him here .
because this is the way to get it done .
then why didn &apos;t you tell me that in the first place ?
because it would have ended up
with you wanting to use rachel .
it ended there anyway . now get the hell out of my way .
don &apos;t make me stop you , sean .
are you threatening a federal prosecutor , harvey ?
you &apos;re goddamn right i am .
well , you better think about this move
more than you thought about the last one .
&apos;cause it &apos;s not gonnaend well for you .
far as i &apos;m concerned ,
it &apos;s the same move .
i made a promise and i &apos;m not gonna break it .
harvey !
whatever you &apos;re fighting about , you can stop .
i told rachel everything .
i &apos;m taking the deal .
then let &apos;s get in the car and get moving .
* oh kiss me one more time *
* oh kiss me one more time *
