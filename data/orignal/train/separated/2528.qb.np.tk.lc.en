well , if ain &apos;t my next @-@ door neighbor , king toot .
moe .
how many times i got to tell you
not to throw your trash in my dumpster ?
oh , come on , szyslak .
i got to make space in the store for my new side business--
a tanning salon that secretly has cameras in the beds ,
that is registered .
yeah , sounds great .
maybe then you could afford to rent your own dumpster .
i like my current deal .
free . of . charge .
i &apos;ll eat your hair !
you call that a testicle kick ?
all right , you two , break it up .
drive on , asphalt cowboy ,
or i &apos;ll squeeze his brain out like an edamame .
eh , uh , a what ?
those beans you eat before your sushi comes .
oh , salt peas .
i call them salt peas .
look , officer , after 20 years of being neighbors ,
tempers sometimes flare up .
moe &apos;s a good guy .
no , no , no , it &apos;s my fault .
i &apos;m a hothead .
i ain &apos;t got no beef with you , toot .
you better stay out of my dumpster .
i &apos;ve also been stealing the catalogs out of your mailbox .
it &apos;s my dumpster !
and that &apos;s the terrifying tale
of how the quebec nordiques became ...
the colorado avalanche .
oh , no !
king toot &apos;s is closed !
dad , you &apos;re going to have to take me to ...
the big box music store .

it &apos;s like some kind of guitar central .
midlife crisis at 12 o &apos;clock .
okay , let me guess , dude .
you &apos;re an ax @-@ man ; you &apos;re looking to score a new blade .
stig .
you &apos;ve got a name that &apos;s not a name .
so what &apos;s your poison , bro ?
les paul ? straight up gibson ?
no , no , no , classic strat , am i right ?
oh , i don &apos;t have what it takes to play guitar .
i mean , i &apos;m no joe walsh in the brain &apos;s department .
who is ?
look , you don &apos;t have the weak ,
womanly fingers of a guitar princess .
you , my friend ,
have the muscular stumps of a bass man .
try this on .
what the rock ?
now that was a lick .
i did a lick ?
keep them coming .
yes , now bob your head .
bob it , bob it , bob it .
dude , usually it takes years to learn such neck confidence .
now check this out .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m amazing .
dude , you &apos;re already
one of the greatest bass players of all time .
okay .
now ... oh , how are you set for stage lights ?
i &apos;m not set at all .
ooh , what about gels ?
this is embarrassing to admit , stig ,
but i haven &apos;t even thought about gels .
堆积木游戏
what is that racket ? !
music !
beautiful music !
what ? !
beautiful music , baby .
the bass guitar ?
this doesn &apos;t really seem like you .
sure it is .
you know i &apos;ve always loved laying things down .
grooves are just the latest .
i feel a powerful connection
to the history of famous bass players .
like what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name from the who .
or that guy from led zeppelin
who wasn &apos;t page , plant or bonham .
those are the only two i know for sure .
it &apos;s so cool to have another musician in the family !
oh , yeah , and you know what the great thing is about music ?
it &apos;s so easy .
uh , well , to truly master an instrument
you &apos;ll need years of ...
so easy .

i can &apos;t take it .
all homer does is play that stupid bass .
you &apos;re not alone , marge .
a man gets older , has a career , a few kids ,
and suddenly there &apos;s a hole in his life
that can only be filled by jamming .
for my julius , it was the drums .
timothy has that awful guitar .
kirk just loves his keyboards .
i never knew so many women suffered
from extramarital jamming .
oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god .
what if all the dads jammed together
in a dad band ? !
that way they would play their horrible music
in one garage at a time .
marge , you &apos;re a genius !
this menu was right--
good things do happen at &apos; zerz .
i don &apos;t know , guys .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m feeling this .
the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument .
what were our wives thinking ?
we probably don &apos;t even like the same tunes .
on the count of three , everyone say
their favorite kind of music .
one , two , three ...
hard @-@ driving rock !
dads , let &apos;s jam !
garage bands rule !
i almost forgot the most important thing .
快来感受炫彩效果
great practice , guys .
what do you say we give it another six hours ,
then call it a day ?
excuse me ,
but my wife told me about your get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ house band .
and , uh , perhaps you need a singer ?
oh , yeah , apu ,
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re a great singer .
but the balance of the band is really delicate right now ,
and we &apos;re not really looking for a world music vibe .
no disrespect to world music .
i love world music .
no , no , i will sing the classic power ballad
&quot; hopin &apos; for a dream &quot; by my favorite band
from the 1980s , sungazer .
追梦
okay , here we go .
* when i close my eyes *
* i wish that i could fantasize *
* pull a dream right out of the air *
* take a chance , turn it into a prayer . *
that sounds nothing like terrible , terrible world music .
why is your voice different when you sing ?
it is because of all the years i spent at the kwik @-@ e @-@ mart ...
... where classic rock anthems were piped in
on a never @-@ ending loop .
the endless repetition drove many clerks to madness .
the only way to maintain my sanity
was to sing along until it seemed like our voices were one .
* hopin &apos; for a dream *
* focus like a laser beam *
* i &apos;ll keep fighting till i want something great *
* hopin &apos; for a dream . *
guys , are you feeling this ?
are you feeling this ?
i &apos;m feeling it .
i &apos;m definitely feeling it .
i felt something earlier , but i was afraid to bring it up .
i think we all felt something .
we are more than just a garage band
desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families .
we are now a cover band .
and we shall be called ...
covercraft .
because we play covers and this is our craft .
and it sounds like hovercraft .
that was not my intent .
okay , covercraft , hands in .
cover ...
craft !

okay , this crowd is about to experience
the special magic of the cover band ,
the thrill of live music
without the fear of hearing anything new .
apu , what &apos;s wrong ?
what if , what if i am no good ?
this is the cabbage festival , man .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know if i can face that crowd !
buddy , buddy . think of it this way :
you &apos;re not singing in front of all those people ,
you &apos;re alone at the kwik @-@ e @-@ mart in the middle of the night .
you just wear this onstage ,
and everything will be fine .
my uniform !
all alone at the kwik @-@ e @-@ mart .

everyone loves you , dad .
you could become a famous rock star !
well , son ,
i do have the talent .
my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write
down the names of and then cover .
but then i remember :
i &apos;m just a regular guy , jamming with my buds .
oh , sweetie .
this band has brought out the best in you .
yeah , you really get that it &apos;s all about the music .
yep .
it &apos;s all about the music .
and it would take a pretty unforeseen development
to change that .
pretty unforeseen ...

gentlemen , i think we &apos;ve found what we &apos;re looking for .
guys , i really need your honesty here .
at the squidport senior jamboree ,
was i too in the pocket ?
freddy freeman , shredder stevens ,
peter d &apos;abbruzio nick delacourt and peter d &apos;abbruzio--
you &apos;re four of the five guys from sungazer !
but where &apos;s your lead singer , grant ledavid ?
uh , he passed away .
how ?
what kind of erotic asphyxiation ?
apu , you &apos;re the only man on the entire internet
who &apos;s got the pure sungazer sound .
will you be our new lead singer
and join us on our stadium tour ?
i think i can answer for apu .
he &apos;s flattered , but the small @-@ time success of covercraft
is all that any of us have ever wanted .
uh , actually , i ...
apu has a rich life here in springfield :
a store full of great products ,
a lovely him @-@ type wife ,
and eight super kids :
anoop , sandeep , nabendu , gheet ,
priya , uma , poonam , sashi ...
shut your mouth , i want to do it !
i want to do it !
i want to be a singer for a real rock band !
sungazer !
gotta say , i &apos;m kind of jealous
of apu getting a break like that .
not me .
i &apos;m nothing but happy
that our friend is headed for fame and fortune .
tonight we play las vegas--
and the theme of the casino is circus !
circus !
i want his fame and fortune so much !
why must the lords of rock be so cruel ? !
sammy hagar ?
you &apos;re not dead .
damn it ! i told you
those jalapeño poppers had too much breading !
sorry , señor hagar .
nah , nah , nah , it &apos;s cool , man .
i went to rock star heaven .
and there was this great back patio with this sweet fire pit .
if you had the right wristband-- which i did .
news story in aisle three ? local clerk ,
apu nahasapeemapetilon ,
is a dead ringer for a dead singer .
he &apos;s living the rock star dream
as front man for &apos; 80s chart @-@ toppers
sungazer on their last final hell re @-@ freezes over
ultimate good @-@ bye for serious this time
never again part two of question mark tour .
apu and the band appeared on saturday night live
as the punch line in a game show sketch .
what &apos;s a game show ?
something you make sketches about .
it looks like apu won &apos;t be playing
the cabbage festival ever again .
dad , you shouldn &apos;t be jealous of apu .
remember , it &apos;s all about the music .
i &apos;m not jealous .
i &apos;m envious .
jealousy is when you worry
someone will take what you have .
envy is wanting what someone else has .
what i feel is envy .
wow , he &apos;s right .
you know what ?
apu leaving is the best thing
that ever happened to this band .
we &apos;re gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left .
you mean more popular but not as good ?
phil collins @-@ era genesis is not as good , huh ?
&quot; no reply at all , &quot; &quot; land of confusion , &quot;
&quot; throwing it all away , &quot; &quot; illegal alien , &quot;
&quot; i can &apos;t dance , &quot; and i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t need to mention ...
&quot; invisible touch &quot; !
you know , we really could use a new lead singer .
you know , i &apos;ve been known to sing a little .
what ? so you can also get famous and bail on us ?
you &apos;re out of the band !
well , you can &apos;t just kick him out .
oh , so you &apos;re sticking up for yoko here ?
looks like i &apos;ve got another yoko on my hands .
how can there be two yokos ?
yoko ! yoko !
all you yokos are out of the band !
are you okay ?
do i sound okay ?
you sound great !
your licks are really ... juicy .
they &apos;re not juicy . my licks are dry .
dry and scratchy like a cat &apos;s tongue .
you didn &apos;t join a band
to become famous like in almost famous .
you loved playing music with your friends .
that was enough to make you happy .
well , it &apos;s not enough anymore .
when something great happens to one person ,
everyone else &apos;s life gets a little worse .
look it up , it &apos;s called physics .
apu is a good man .
he sent over front row tickets and backstage passes
to his show at the costington center .
oh , you mean he generously invited us
to come watch him be a rock star ?
stop feeling sorry for yourself .
your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him ,
and you are coming with us to share in his talent .
i &apos;ll never have a per diem .
you don &apos;t know what a per diem is .
still want one .
apu wouldn &apos;t be able to sing a note
if i didn &apos;t help him get over his stage fright
with his kwik @-@ e @-@ mart shirt .
backstage pass ,
you just became a payback rage pass .
look at all this rock star dressing room stuff .
what a sellout .
cheese plate ...
oh , sorry , cubed cheese plate .
lemon tea , probably for his throat .
let &apos;s see how he performs in front of all those people
without his magic @-@ people- performing @-@ in @-@ front @-@ of shirt .
but , mr. shredder , you promised me
after we played my hometown i could have a day off .
i also promised i &apos;d kick heroin .
but the tour is so hard on my family .
my octuplets are being raised
by roadies and bodyguards .
this is not proper .
look , apu .
for 25 years we wasted money on women , drugs
and guitars with live fish inside .
and now we want to keep it going .
you signed a contract for a three @-@ year ,
57 @-@ country tour at union scale--
no per diem .
you &apos;re in the band .
oh , well , i guess it &apos;s showtime .
homer ?
i &apos;m sorry , apu .
i thought you were living your dream life ,
so naturally i wanted to ruin it .
but now i know things stink ,
so i &apos;m okay with it .
oh , what is the point ?
i am trapped like a kwik @-@ e @-@ mart hot dog on a roller .
kwik @-@ e @-@ mart hot dog , eh ?
you want every hot dog in the store ?
every one ?
okay ...
ladies and gentlemen ,
tucks medicated pads presents ...
sungazer !
yeah ! all right !
uh , people ?
i am sorry to report
that all the original members of the band
have been struck down
by a mysterious case of hot dog poisoning .
rather than refund your money
or reschedule the show ,
we have a surprise for you .
get ready to rock with a group
that is truly all about the music-- covercraft !

so there i am , on easter island ,
and the heads ask me to play them a song .
i say , &quot; why me , heads ?
you &apos;ve heard the music of the universe itself . &quot;
and they say , &quot; sammy ,
your stuff rocks just a little harder . &quot;
that &apos;s when i wake up .
i &apos;m in the springfield elementary parking lot ,
doing a buck fifty @-@ five in my ferrari 512 boxer .
i was cornering so hard , i blacked out from the gs , man .
they say i ran over the groundskeeper .
probably get life in prison .
but i got a plan to escape ,
using only this harmonica
and some guitar picks with my face on &apos; em .
who &apos;s with me on this ?
