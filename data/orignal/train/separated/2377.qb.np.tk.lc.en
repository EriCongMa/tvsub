第三季 第八集
the only thing stronger than your craving for blood
is your love for this one girl .
your humanity is killing you .
turn it off .
no !
turn it off !
what did you do ?
i fixed him .
fight for it . feel something ,
anything , stefan .
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t ,
you &apos;re gonna lose me forever .
the necklace is a talisman
from the original witch herself .
the old witch can draw power from this side
because of her talisman .
bonnie needs to destroy it .
they &apos;re looking for mikael ,
the vampire who hunts vampires .
you don &apos;t want to wake him . he will kill all of you .
i thought you might know how to kill klaus .
i can kill klaus , and i will .
there &apos;s an old lockwood family legend about it ,
a weapon that can kill an original vampire .
like the rest of their secrets ,
they kept it buried .
i found something .
what is it ?
i have no idea .
so the lockwoods really have no idea
that these tunnels are underneath their property ?
yeah . careful where you shine that thing .
bats hate the light .
wait . what ?
elena .
god , damon .
scaredy @-@ cat .
just ignore him .
that &apos;s what i do .
so you really can &apos;t get in ?
no .
seems even the ancient lockwoods
were anti @-@ vampire .
what do you mean , ancient ?
see for yourself .
this is as far as i go .
what is all this ?
well , as far as i can tell , it &apos;s a story .
in simple archaeological terms ,
it &apos;s a really , really old story .
that right there is a moon cycle .
a man . a wolf .
a werewolf .
yeah . it &apos;s the lockwood diaries ,
pictionary style .
i don &apos;t understand .
i thought the lockwoods came here
with the original founders in the 1860s .
ah , maybe the lockwoods did ,
but according to this wall ,
these werewolves have been here a lot longer than that .
how long ?
long .
gets better . show her , ric .
names , and they &apos;re not native .
they &apos;re written in runic , a viking script .
vikings ?
this name here ,
when translated , it reads ...
niklaus .
klaus .
and elijah ,
and rebekah .
rebekah , let me have at it .
quiet , niklaus .
i have to have my concentration
if i &apos;m not to slice off a finger .
father will not like you handling the blade .
if i want to wield a blade ,
i shall wield a blade .
father need not know .
he will find out . he always does .
that is because you always tell him .
i cannot help it .
he frightens me .
he frightens us all .
that is why we stick together as one ,
always and forever .
right , traitor ?
right .
here . you finish .
i &apos;m to help mother with the meal .
yes . go tend to dinner .
leave the blades to the men , little sister .
ahh . bekka .
it &apos;s just a little blood .
be a man about it .
these are the names of the original family ?
carved into a cave that &apos;s--
that &apos;s been here since way before the founding of mystic falls
or even the entire new world , for that matter .
ok , this has gotta be one of klaus &apos; fakes .
that &apos;s what i said .
that could be true ,
except the last name up here made us think otherwise .
what &apos;s the name ?
mikael .
mikael .
mikael , as in the vampire hunter
who knows how to kill klaus ?
yep .
and i like to call him papa original .
these images tell a story
to learn the story , you have to decipher these images .
sloppy .
shut up . i &apos;m new at this .
the ghost of christmas past , mason lockwood ,
said that the cave would lead us to a weapon
that could kill klaus .
yeah , but doesn &apos;t mikael have a weapon ?
yes , which probably means the wall will lead us to mikael ,
who we &apos;ve already found and lost .
you &apos;re dead .
these images , at the very least ,
might tell us what that weapon is .
then all we have to do is find out what they mean .
well , fine . fine .
if i &apos;m being irritatingly optimistic like you two
how do you suppose we do that ?
well , if the story &apos;s about the original family living here ,
then we go straight to the source .
you .
goody .
i was hoping we could talk .
about what ? stefan ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m off him
until he starts treating me better .
in fact , you should probably take a page out of my book ,
if i &apos;m being honest .
actually , i &apos;d rather talk about this .
i &apos;m curious why you and klaus
have spent a thousand years running from your father .
i should get back to the girls .
home coming &apos;s right around the corner .
well , then maybe i &apos;ll ask mikael when we wake him .
you &apos;re bluffing .
you don &apos;t know where he is .
no one does .
so then who &apos;s rotting in that old cemetery in charlotte ?
if you wake mikael , we are all doomed .
so then tell me .
why do you want to know ?
why don &apos;t you want me to wake him ?
i need to get back to the girls .
come on , henrik .
our brothers are fighting again .
oh , look . sister &apos;s arrived to watch my fast @-@ approaching victory .
on the contrary , elijah .
she &apos;s come to laugh at you .
relax , mikael .
niklaus means well .
that is precisely my problem .
so ...
why don &apos;t you teach me that trick , young warrior ?
father , we were just having fun .
we fight for our survival .
and you find time for fun ? !
i want to have fun ! teach me . come on !
father , it was nothing .
you are foolish and impulsive , my boy .
what ?
no more laughter ?
you &apos;ve made your point , mikael .
some days , it &apos;s a miracle you &apos;re still alive ...
boy .
she &apos;s going to tell me .
she &apos;s scared of him , damon . i saw her face .
i just have to engage in a little mean @-@ girl power struggle first .
make sure she doesn &apos;t power struggle you into a wheelchair .
i &apos;ve got this , damon .
if we can figure out a way to kill klaus ,
stefan will be free of his compulsion .
so how does he look ?
pasty and pouty .
he &apos;ll have to get over it .
call me later .
rebekah will come around .
you sure about that ?
i mean , a thousand @-@ year @-@ old vampire , i &apos;m sure ,
has learned the art of patience .
she &apos;s a thousand @-@ year @-@ old vampire
who &apos;s joined the cheerleading squad .
there &apos;s a whole different set of rules in play here , ric .
i &apos;ve got this .
you know , if you two
are gonna keep me locked in here for the next decade ,
i think we can skip the routine visits .
you know i &apos;m not a big champion
of this whole lexi recovery plan .
but elena thinks this place is gonna ...
weaken you out , break you down ,
and make you feel again .
we should all listen to elena , right ?
i mean , her plans always work out so well , don &apos;t they ?
why are you here ?
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s family day at vampire rehab .
just paying a visit to my baby brother .
go away .
nah , i thought we could hang out .
little brother bonding .
how you been , stef ? huh ?
you know , klaus may want to keep elena alive ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean she &apos;s safe with rebekah .
liar , liar , pants on fire , brother .
klaus compelled you to protect elena ,
and if you thought for even a second that she was in danger ,
you &apos;d be working a lot harder .
you got me . yep .
you got me . you &apos;re good .
congratulations .
you can go now .
you really have given up .
actually , this is my happy face .
what are you doing ?
screw this lexi plan .
i think we could both use a drink .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
you invited me over to talk .
all right , girls .
have at it .
okay , now twirl , please .
you &apos;ve compelled your own private runway show ?
i need a homecoming dress .
so what do you think ? pick one .
heh . i &apos;m not here to help you shop .
i &apos;m here to talk about
why you don &apos;t want me to wake up mikael .
i said pick one , elena .
the red one .
there . that wasn &apos;t so hard , was it ?
go away . remember nothing .
you do not threaten me .
you will learn what i allow you to learn .
is that clear ?
hey , there .
bonnie . come on in .
got your message .
yeah , great . uh ...
i &apos;m sorry the place is such a mess .
i &apos;m obsessed .
brought you the necklace that wouldn &apos;t die .
that &apos;s great .
are you ok ?
been better .
listen , jeremy is an idiot ,
and i know this with certainty
because i was once a jeremy .
trust me . we learn eventually .
so i &apos;ve been staring at this image all day ,
wondering why it looked so familiar ...
and i was right .
it &apos;s the same design .
so your grandmother said this necklace
belonged to the witch that
put the hybrid curse on klaus , right ?
this symbol is repeated all across the wall ,
and i &apos;ve been trying to figure out what it meant .
now i know .
how fun is this ?
we shouldn &apos;t be here .
of course we should .
come on . like you &apos;ve never wanted to snoop .
boxer briefs .
now , that &apos;s a change from the twenties .
are you gonna root through his stuff all night ,
or are you gonna start to tell me your story ?
you really are no fun .
what do you want to know ?
well , elijah said that your father was a landowner in europe .
how did you guys end up here ?
my parents had just started a family
when a plague struck their homeland .
they lost a child to it .
they wanted to escape
and protect their future family from the same fate .
so how did you end up here ?
this part of the world hadn &apos;t even been discovered yet .
heh . not by anyone in your history books .
but my mother knew the witch ayana ,
who heard from the spirits of a mystical land
where everyone was healthy ...
blessed by the gifts of speed and strength .
that led my family here ,
where we lived amongst those people .
the werewolves .
to us , they were just our neighbors .
my family lived in peace with them for over 20 years ,
during which time my family had more children ,
including me .
you make it sound so normal .
it was .
once a month , our family
retreated to the caves beneath our village .
the wolves would howl through the night ,
and by morning , we &apos;d return home .
ayana , you burned me .
that is not yours to touch .
mother !
is that klaus ?
something is wrong .
henrik !
mother !
one full moon , klaus and my youngest brother henrik
snuck out to watch the men turn into beasts .
that was forbidden .
henrik paid the price .
no . no . what happened ?
the wolves .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we must save him .
please , there must be a way .
the spirits will not give us a way , esther .
your boy is gone .
no . no .
and that was the beginning
of the end of peace with our neighbors .
and one of the last moments my family had together as humans .
you better get that .
that &apos;ll be damon checking up on you .
hello .
damon , where are you ?
no idea , but i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m overdressed .
still standing ?
yes . i &apos;m fine , but i can &apos;t talk right now .
i &apos;ll be at the bar .
was that stefan ?
yeah . i kind of went off @-@ book ,
but don &apos;t worry . i know what i &apos;m doing .
damon , how could you let him out ?
i &apos;ve got this , elena .
what are we drinking ?
hopefully something a little bit warmer , a little blonder .
hello ...
&quot; callie . &quot;
i would love a shot of your best whiskey ,
and my brother here would love a shot of you .
what &apos;s the catch , damon ?
no catch , brother .
drink up . it &apos;s on me .
hi , callie .
drink up , brother .
will you get us another bottle of this , hmm ?
yes , sir .
you been on this bunny diet for the better part of 50 years ,
so how is it that saint stefan , of all people ,
gets good at a drinking game ?
well , the bunny diet gave me a lot of time to practice .
wallow in despair .
drown in guilt .
regret my existence .
it &apos;s precision born out of tragic boredom .
drink up , brother .
all that effort wasted trying to tell you how boring you were ,
and now you finally agree with me ?
damon , you are worse than elena .
getting me drunk . brotherly bonding .
what , you think i &apos;ll break down ,
and you can pull me back from the edge ?
is that it ?
i happen to like the edge , stefan .
your problem is your inability
to resist falling over it .
you &apos;re all or nothing , man .
you can &apos;t just be .
although ...
who am i to judge ?
drink up , brother .
did you get your fill of snooping yet ?
can we get on with the story ?
honestly , i don &apos;t get you two as a couple .
why would you ?
you don &apos;t know anything about who he really is .
i know exactly who he is .
he &apos;s a vampire .
we &apos;re a predatory species .
we don &apos;t have time to care about humans
and their silly little lives .
is that why you did that runway show earlier ?
if you don &apos;t care about the homecoming dance ?
you know what ?
i &apos;m just gonna go .
you haven &apos;t even heard half the story .
and you &apos;re not going to tell it .
you &apos;re just bored and looking for someone to push around .
find someone else to play with .
maybe you can compel yourself a friend .
the necklace wasn &apos;t stefan &apos;s to give .
it belonged to the original witch .
the one who put the hybrid curse on klaus ?
not just the hybrid curse .
she &apos;s the one who turned us into vampires .
please , ayana , i implore you .
you must call upon the spirits before the next full moon .
i will not . it is a crime against nature .
ayana , we have already lost too much .
we cannot lose any more .
the spirits can help us find a way to protect our children .
i &apos;m thirsty . do you want a drink ?
so vampirism was a form of protection ?
what else would it be ?
a curse .
my parents only saw a way of keeping their children alive .
yeah , but why stay ?
if they were so afraid of the werewolves ,
why not leave ?
pride .
my father didn &apos;t want to run anymore .
he wanted to fight and be superior to the wolves .
where they could bite , we had to bite harder .
where they had speed , we had to be faster .
agility , strength , senses .
everything could be heightened .
our family could live forever .
at what cost ?
this magic you speak of breeds consequence .
this is the makings of a plague , esther .
the spirits will turn on you .
please , ayana .
i will have no part in it .
if she will not protect our family ...
then it is in your hands alone , my love .
in her hands ?
how could she do anything ?
because my mother was also a witch .
what ?
the witch of the original family ,
the original witch .
where do they keep their best vintage ?
but if your mother was a witch , then--
am i ? no .
a witch is nature &apos;s servant .
a vampire is an abomination of nature .
you can either be one or the other ,
never both .
my mother did this for us .
she did not turn .
how did you turn ?
she called upon the sun for life
and the ancient white oak tree ,
one of nature &apos;s eternal objects , for immortality .
that night , my father offered us wine laced with blood .
and then he drove his sword through our hearts .
he killed you .
and he wasn &apos;t delicate about it either .
rebekah .
blood . what happened ?
it &apos;ll be all right .
we will be all right .
what are you doing ?
we must finish what we started .
you must drink if you want to live .
we had to drink more blood to complete the ritual .
drink .
no , no .
drink !
drink !
it was euphoric .
the feeling of power was indescribable .
but the witch ayana
was right about the consequences .
the spirits turned on us ,
and nature fought back .
for every strength , there would be a weakness .
the sun became our enemy .
it kept us indoors for weeks .
and then my mother found a solution .
there were other problems .
inside .
neighbors who had opened to their homes to us
could now keep us out .
flowers at the base of the white oak burned
and prevented compulsion .
and the spell decreed
that the tree that gave us life
could also take it away .
so we burned it to the ground .
the darkest consequence
was something my parents never anticipated ...
the hunger .
blood had made us reborn ,
and it was blood that we craved above all else .
we could not control it .
and with that
the predatory species was born .
nothing to see here .
just run along .
okay ?
hey , hey , hey . ease up . ease up .
she &apos;s giving us her employee discount .
now just run along .
two more .
all right , time to fess up .
what &apos;s the point of the jailbreak ? hmm ?
i thought you could use a hug , stefan .
come on , damon . you know elena &apos;s
gonna hate you for letting me out ,
and we both know that you care about what she thinks .
maybe i wanted to remind you what freedom was like
before klaus took it from you .
as long as klaus is alive ,
i do what he says .
that &apos;s my point , stefan .
you &apos;ve given up .
now , you can sit around and be his little bitch ,
or you can get mad enough ,
and you can do something about it .
damon , he can &apos;t be killed .
maybe i can help with that .
the salvatore boys , i presume .
mikael .
why did mikael start hunting klaus ?
when nik made his first human kill ,
it triggered his werewolf gene .
with that , he became my father &apos;s greatest shame .
yeah . elijah told me this part of the story .
your mother had had an affair with
one of the werewolf villagers .
klaus wasn &apos;t his son .
she tried to make it right .
she put the hybrid curse on nik
to suppress his werewolf side ,
and then she turned her back on him ,
but mikael &apos;s greatest weakness as a human
was his pride .
as a vampire , that was magnified .
he went on a rampage and killed half the village .
then he came home and killed her .
mikael killed your mother ?
he said she broke his heart
so he would break hers .
he tore it from her chest as nik watched .
afterwards , my father took off in a rage ,
and the rest of my family scattered .
nik stayed so he could help me bury her .
he knew i had to say good @-@ bye to my mother .
i know you think she hated you , niklaus ,
but she did not .
she was just afraid .
i &apos;m sorry she turned her back on you .
i will never do that .
nor will i.
we stick together as one .
always and forever .
always and forever .
even though he locked you in a coffin for 90 years .
we &apos;re vampires .
our emotions are heightened .
i &apos;m stubborn ,
elijah moral ,
and nik ...
nik has no tolerance for those who disappoint him .
over a thousand years as a family ,
we &apos;ve all made that mistake at least once .
i &apos;ve made it several times .
but you still love him ?
he &apos;s my brother ,
and i am immortal .
should i spend an eternity alone instead ?
you &apos;ve heard the story . it &apos;s time to go .
i said leave , elena .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re up to ,
but i am no longer playing along .
i &apos;m just looking for one good reason
why we shouldn &apos;t wake mikael .
and i &apos;ve given you a thousand .
but you will anyway .
i know you want him to help you
kill my brother . i &apos;m not stupid .
it &apos;s no secret that i want klaus dead .
he has a hold over stefan &apos;s life and over mine .
do what you need .
wake mikael at your own peril .
but make no mistake ,
if you come after my brother ,
i will rip you apart .
and i get my temper from my father .
now leave .
has klaus entered the country ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
has he spoken to you since he left ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
all right .
can you tell me the last time
you spoke to niklaus ?
i am compelled to do what he says ,
and he says to keep my damn mouth shut .
i really hope this game of 20 questions
isn &apos;t your secret weapon .
you see , damon ,
i &apos;ve been a vampire hunter longer than you &apos;ve been alive .
it &apos;s why i found you here .
it &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna find niklaus .
well , klaus has been running for about a thousand years ,
so if you think you &apos;re gonna get a workaround he--
careful , stefan .
one move , and his heart &apos;s gone .
now ...
where is klaus ?
come on .
what &apos;s the trick question , stefan ?
one twist , and he &apos;s dead .
unless you don &apos;t care , of course .
his emotions have been shut off . he can &apos;t care .
really ?
his link to klaus is so strong that ...
he would let his own brother die ?
no ideas ? hmm ?
think , stefan .
i guess you &apos;re right .
he &apos;s a dead end .
and so are you , damon .
wait .
i can bring him back .
i can lure klaus back to mystic falls .
and there is our loophole .
just had to rile him up a bit .
get klaus back to mystic falls ,
and i will gladly drive a stake through his heart .
fail ...
i &apos;ll drive it through yours .
yeah . filled in what we could .
got vampire ,
werewolf ,
slaughter ,
mayhem , et cetera , et cetera .
that &apos;s the white oak tree
which means that was when they burned down the tree ,
destroying the only way that they could be killed .
okay , so tree equals weapon , sort of ,
but we already knew that .
what we &apos;re not sure about is this .
we &apos;ve got the witch symbol
and what looks like a bleeding heart .
upside @-@ down figures usually signify death of some kind .
mikael killed the witch by ripping out her heart .
but why is that one connected to the witch &apos;s death ?
i don &apos;t know . we haven &apos;t gotten that far .
oh , my god .
rebekha doesn &apos;t know the real story .
i thought i told you to leave twice .
how do you know that michael killed your mother ?
nik was there . he told me .
he lied to you .
and how do you know that ?
the cave where you carved your family &apos;s names
is covered in symbols ,
the story of your family--
how your parents arrived ,
how they made peace ,
the spell that turned them into vampires ,
and this . this is the symbol for hybrid .
it &apos;s the combination of the werewolf and the vampire symbol .
and this is the one for your mother .
her necklace .
and this is the story of her death .
the hybrid killed the original witch .
not mikael , klaus .
no .
no , he wouldn &apos;t .
she put the curse on him ,
made it so that he would be the only one
of his kind , and then she rejected him .
with the werewolf gene comes aggression and violence .
when he turned , all of that was heightened .
he killed her , rebecca ,
and then he made up this entire lie
about your father so that he wouldn &apos;t lose you .
these mean nothing .
they &apos;re just stupid drawings .
done by stupid people who had no idea who my family was !
then why are you so upset ?
why are you doing this to me ?
i &apos;ve done nothing to you .
klaus killed your mother .
he has a hold on you , on me , on everyone .
he has for a thousand years .
we have to make it stop .
shut up ! just shut up !
don &apos;t talk anymore ! nothing !
well , i give you 10 points for flair .
at least now we know where klaus
and elijah learned their tricks from .
don &apos;t think you had to wait till the last second
to have your breakthrough , though .
didn &apos;t have a breakthrough , damon .
&quot; ooh . ooh , my brother &apos;s about to die ,
and i just had to save his life for the bajillionth time . &quot;
careful , stefan . your humanity &apos;s showing .
actually , you know what ? you &apos;re right , damon .
you &apos;re right . you reminded me
what my freedom felt like .
and when we kill klaus ,
i &apos;ll be free ,
free to leave .
see , i didn &apos;t do this for you , damon .
i did it for myself .
sure , stefan .
whatever you say .
why are you doing this , huh ?
what do you want from me ?
why is everybody trying to save me ?
because i have to , stefan .
because you &apos;re in this mess with klaus
because you saved my life ,
because i owe you .
and i can &apos;t just leave you in a cell to rot .
better be careful , brother .
your humanity &apos;s showing .
damon , seriously ?
we got mikael .
what ?
how ?
no idea . i guess katherine came through .
the plan &apos;s in motion .
see ? told you i had it .
go ahead . kick , yell , scream .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve been planning your rant all day .
i &apos;m not gonna yell at you .
why not ?
i went behind your back , freed stefan .
and you know what ? it backfired .
he &apos;s an even bigger dick than ever .
it &apos;s just now he &apos;s a dick that &apos;s on our side .
i &apos;m not mad .
i &apos;m tired . i just-- i want to go to bed .
no , i think mikael &apos;s weapon is a stake ,
because he mentioned something about it .
well , then they must have carved it
from the white oak tree before they burned it down .
so i was right .
after all that , the wall led us to mikael .
it led us to more than just that .
i think i got rebekah on our side , too .
really ?
what &apos;d you learn from her ?
i learned that she &apos;s just a girl ,
that she lost her mom too young ,
and she loves blindly and recklessly ,
even if it consumes her .
you know , when all is said and done ,
there &apos;s nothing more important than the bond of family .
you should tell that to my brother .
i &apos;m not mad at you for letting him out , damon .
i think that you &apos;re gonna be the one to save him from himself .
it won &apos;t be because he loves me .
it &apos;ll be because he loves you .
can i tell you the rest tomorrow ?
