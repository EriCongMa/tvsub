Look at me.
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Why is he doing this?
Is that enough?
We did what you wanted. Let us go.
No.
Now it's my turn.
No!
Hey good news.
Ellie just got placed with a foster family
so fingers crossed.
Oh that's great. I'm happy for her.
We got a case in Akron Ohio.
Two couples killed in two weeks.
One a week?
That's not much of a cooling-off period.
Scott and Kathy Hartway.
Found in their car in an isolated spot.
The son of Sam had a short cooling-off period.
He also attacked couples in cars.
Yeah but the first couple were killed in their house.
Robert and Allison Keppler.
In both cases the husbands were killed
with a silenced 9-millimeter
the wife was stabbed multiple times.
He crosses racial lines.
And socio-economic ones.
The Kepplers lived in an upscale neighborhood
the Hartways were blue collar.
That's a big change in crime scenes car versus house.
Two radically different M.O.s
Not to mention he subdues two people.
That takes a lot of skill.
There's no indication of how he overwhelms them.
There's no antemortem bruising. He doesn't use a blitz attack.
Well he's got a 9-millimeter.
He doesn't need to.
How about signs of forced entry to the car or the house?
No. But Akron P.D. did find this.
Handcuffs. So he restrains the men
and saves the real savaging for the wife.
Is this right?
They found a used condom on both the husbands?
And both had Viagra in their systems
and neither had a prescription.
So the unsub gives the men Viagra
and then forces them to have sex before he kills them.
And given the timetable he's gonna strike again soon.
We fly to Akron tonight. Wheels up in 3 hours.
Garcia. What's that?
My go bags.
Where are you going?
With you hopefully.
Sir I think we're all still reeling since JJ left
and we are a man down
and you need a communications liaison.
Garcia--
Sir please hear me out.
My job overlapped with JJ's the most.
I created that program that she used to present cases.
When you guys were out in the field
she coordinated your needs through me. It makes sense.
Garcia there are aspects of the job for which you have no training.
You're totally right but I--I'm willing to learn.
I'll learn how to interact with families
and local law enforcement and the media.
Sir I'm willing to tone down my wardrobe choices.
I'm ready to make that sacrifice
if you just please give me a chance.
All right. We could explore this on a trial basis.
We'll see how things go.
Are you up to speed on the case?
Yes.
Can you be ready in 3 hours?
I'm ready now.
See you on the plane.
Ok.
Abraham Lincoln said
"Whatever you are be a good one."
I'm just waiting on a few last-minute details.
Let'go ahead and get started.
I keep bumping on the fact
that he makes a married couple have sex before he kills them.
What is he accomplishing with that?
You know the stabbing of the wives
is almost certainly piqueristic.
The unsub gets sexual gratification
from penetration with a knife.
Most piquerists are impotent--
men like Albert Fish Iain Scoular Andrei Chikatilo
so for him it could be a substitute for sex.
The unsub could also be playing a mind game.
Neither shot to the husband is clean
so they have to watch what he's doing to their wives
as they're dying.
So this guy challenges their manhood
by forcing them to have sex
and then mocks them with the overkill.
That kind of psychological torture
makes him a sexual sadist.
It would explain the amount of control
he exhibits over the crime scene--
the handcuffs the condoms the silenced weapon.
He plans out every detail.
If he's that precise
he would be just as precise in his victimology.
But he's all over the map
in terms of class and race.
Well there must be something else
about the couples that attracts him.
Something that he couldn't learn
by stalking them anonymously.
Maybe the couples met the unsub before.
Rossi and Reid will you handle the family interviews?
Morgan and Prentiss go to the latest crime scene.
We need to learn as much as we can about him
so let's really pin down the M.O.
Well look at you look at you.
Meet your new communications liaison.
Trial communications liaison.
Garcia I don't get to say this often
but I had no idea there was this side of you.
Well I figure since I'm going to have to
interact with the mass populace
I should dress in the traditional costume of a mere mortal.
What's wrong?
Oh it's my contact.
It keeps getting weird and...Huh.
There it goes.
No.
Yes. No.
Detective Crowley?
Hi. Miss Garcia.
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
And she emailed pictures of you guys.
Agents Hotchner Rossi
and Dr. Reid right?
It's doctor not Agent.
She was specific about that.
What else was she specific about?
Everything your team needed.
I sent her a list of family members
who'd be willing to talk
and your boards are over there
all ready for you to set them up.
I even got the push pins you asked for.
Excuse me.
Are you miss Garcia?
Mr. Keppler. Hi.
Hi.
This is Detective Crowley.
He'll show you to the interview room.
Hello sir.
Right this way.
He is such a sweet man.
You contacted the family members already?
Yes. Only two responded back immediately.
That's Robert Keppler's dad
and then Scott Hartway's mom will be here in about an hour.
Is that enough time?
Yes. Perfect.
Ok. I'm gonna set up the boards
unless you need something else.
No we're good. Thank you.
Great.
And you were worried.
Ok thank you.
So he has a gun
he gains the upper hand immediately.
He keeps it trained on the wife
so the husband has no choice but to surrender.
Where does he confront them?
Not the parking lot. Too many variables
for someone this controlled.
He could have been lying in wait in the backseat though.
No.
I mean if they were facing forward
the unsub's back here down low
he pops up with his gun
there's no chance for them to fight back.
He could have used a Slim Jim to get in.
That wouldn't leave any marks.
Yeah but here's the real trick.
How did he force two people
to have sex at gunpoint?
With Viagra apparently.
Viagra's a vasodilator.
It takes at least 30 minutes
to get the blood vessels to relax properly.
I mean Scott's fight or flight response would have kicked in.
His heart's racing his blood's flowing to all his extremities
but not the right one.
Maybe he got them to relax.
He tells them he'll
let them live if they do this.
This guy has to control everything.
That would include the environment right?
Oh he turned the heat all the way up.
He didn't want them getting cold?
Radio announcer: 105.5
This station wasn't one of the presets.
That means he tuned it for them.
It's almost like he went out of his way
to make sure they were comfortable.
A sexual sadist wouldn't do that.
We need to take a look at the first crime scene.
Can you walk us
through a typical day in your son's life?
What do you mean?
The man we're looking for
may very well have met Robert and Allison.
Can you tell us what they liked to do?
I can tell you those two were married.
To their jobs.
He was lawyer and she was a pediatrician.
They went to work
they came home.
That was their day.
So he was driven.
Scott was at the Post Office by 7:00 every morning.
He had his eye on that branch manager office.
He wanted to run the whole zip code.
So did he have enemies at work?
Robert stepped on toes to close a deal I suppose
but he was shooting for v.P. By the end of the year.
He--he'd have made it too.
Was he that way his entire life?
Class president 4 years in a row.
So many all-americans...
He ran out of room on his varsity jacket.
What about college?
Well top of his class at Harvard.
Made "Law Review" At Yale.
I was very proud.
So both victims were alpha males?
It's the only trait we could find that connects the couples.
We know that female type isn't specific to this unsub
but what if this is?
Typically alpha males only attack other alphas.
That's how the unsub sees himself.
These men are the only competitors he takes seriously.
And the overkill on the wives is expression
of control in alpha male terms.
He's proving his dominance over his rival
by obliterating their mate.
We need more details about these men's lives.
I'll have Garcia pull up more personal information.
Detective have you seen Ms. Garcia?
She's outside talking to a reporter.
Guy from the local paper wanted a quote from the FBI.
Excuse me.
No comment.
Off the record then.
Is the FBI assisting the Akron police
in the couple killer case?
Ok first of all no comment means no comment.
Second of all that name of the killer--
you came up with that name. We didn't come up with that name.
Well forget the name. The name's gone.
Just uh give me some background
and we'll hold the story until you give me the green light.
You'll hold the story?
Absolutely.
Have you cleared that with your editor?
Uh...Of course.
Can you get him on the phone?
And the hold also applies to
your blog that the paper hosts?
Right. That.
You sneaky son of a--
you'll have your story when the Akron police make an arrest.
Until then the FBI has no comment
as Ms. Garcia stated. Thank you.
He lied. He lied to me.
No he just counted on you not asking the right questions.
Why didn't you check with me before you talked to him?
I looked everywhere and I couldn't find you.
And I figured it was one of those things
that you would just count on me to handle.
Garcia I appreciate the initiative
but when it comes to dealing with the press
let me handle things for now.
Yes sir. Absolutely.
I need all the credit card and phone records
for all the husbands.
We think the unsub is targeting them first.
Ok.
Thank you.
Hotch there's something you need to see.
This is the second crime scene.
The unsub took the Hartways to lovers lane.
Then he turned the heat up in the vehicle
and tuned the radio to a soul music station.
This is the first crime scene.
Al Green was in the CD player
candles had been lit.
He's staging the scene.
Control is critical to him.
We know this.
But to a different end than we initially thought.
These murders are about the fantasy
only the fantasy isn't sadistic it's romantic.
Well we profiled from the interviews
that he's picking the husbands first. How's that romantic?
Alpha males marry the most attractive females.
Once he meets the husband
he knows the wife is gonna fit his needs.
We know this unsub is impotent
but what we're seeing here isn't the usual psychological block
keeping him from getting aroused. This is physiological.
How can you be sure of that?
He brings Viagra to the crime scenes.
If he wanted he could pop a pill
let the drug take effect.
Instead he gives it to the husbands. Why?
It's not working for him anymore.
Something definitely happened to this guy.
Prostate cancer surgery something.
But whatever it was
it cut him off from fulfilling his needs
so he's using the couples as surrogates.
So why does he make the husband wear a condom?
Well we don't know that connection yet.
He's going to kill the husbands anyway.
He can't perform on the wives.
The condoms are redundant.
If the theory's right
he's acting out a fantasy
in which contraception plays a key role.
Until we understand what the role is
we're not gonna find him.
Quick!
Get the--
baby get the--
Ohh! No!
No! No...
No...No...
Wait.
I'll do what you want.
Just don't hurt me
please...
Tell me you want me.
I want you.
Say it...
Like you mean it.
I want you.
Do you want me?
You do.
You want me.
You want me.
You want me.
You want me. Say you want me.
You want me.
I just heard.
The unsub shot both victims last night?
The housekeeper found them this morning.
His routine was disrupted. That means he made a mistake.
It also means he's out of control.
He's enraged. He's going to attack again soon.
Paul Wilson spinal surgeon.
Alpha male just like the others.
Can you just hold on for a moment?
The offensive and defensive wounds all over his body.
He was cuffed behind his back.
He still put up a hell of a fight.
Because he knew how. Look. The wounds extend
from his knees to the soles of his feet.
That's full-contact training.
Now where would learn something like that?
My assumption would be a mixed martial arts gym.
MMA has skyrocketed among the men who want
the most intense fighting possible.
Which our unsub would.
It could be where he's finding his victims.
I'll follow up with the families.
Maybe she went for the gun in the drawer
forced the unsub to shoot her
and stopped him from following his ritual.
No 'cause there was a muzzle burn on her chest.
He shot her at pointblank range.
Ok you're the unsub
I'm Debra Wilson.
I have to get past you to get to that gun.
But she takes her robe off.
Now your 9-millimeter
is right here at my chest.
What am I doing?
She offered herself to him?
Well why would she do that?
Why not lock herself in the bathroom or run out the door?
Well survival isn't logical it's instinctual.
Her instincts probably told her that this was her best shot.
Ok. She's telling herself she's gonna do whatever is necessary
to get out of this alive.
So she's just seen her husband die in front of her.
Then she comes on to the unsub?
An overt sexual expression.
Yeah it's almost flexible. She's gone from one man
to the next without hesitation.
He makes the husband wear a condom.
What does that say about him?
That he's protecting himself?
It's a sexual scenario
where you're sharing a woman with another man.
Am I crazy
or could this guy be a swinger?
He could have been a part
of that scene until the impotence kicked in.
And now he's just trying to recreate it.
These couples could have been his old partners.
Ok so here's what I found out.
Only Paul Wilson trained at an mma gym
but all the other husbands worked out regularly
from the local YMCA to expensive fitness clubs.
Makes sense. Alpha males care about their appearance.
The gym is also a good place to stalk victims.
It still doesn't tell us
how he goes from finding husbands in a gym
to getting inside their house.
No but it does give us a list from which we can eliminate.
Yeah but we've got a bigger problem here.
The unsub's fantasy was interrupted.
At the least he's hunting again tonight.
At the worst he'll escalate his violence.
Will you ask Crowley to gather his officers.
We can give the profile.
Garcia.
Yes sir.
We've got a possible lead in the husbands' gyms and health clubs.
I need a list of everyone in and out.
Ok so employees and members.
No wider than that. Outside vendors
maintenance trainers everybody.
That's a lot. And I'm not done cataloguing
husbands' records like you asked me to
'cause I keep getting delayed.
Delayed how?
Uh family members calling back cops with questions.
Also I'm helping Morgan call swing clubs
'cause we thought some of the victims might be swingers.
They're not. By the way there's more swing clubs in Akron
than there really should be.
Garcia I need you to prioritize this.
We need to get ahead of this guy.
He may strike again tonight.
Sir may I please bring Kevin Lynch in?
It could help me get it done like bang.
That's fine and if for any reason you get stuck just let me know.
And tell Morgan and Prentiss
that we're releasing the profile.
Have them give it to everybody that they've met
In the swingers community
Yes yes I can do that.
Uh Jehovah's Witnesses?
Oh no ma'am. Um...
I'm special Agent Prentiss.
This is special Agent Morgan.
We're with the FBI.
We heard that you ran uh
fabulous fun and over 40?
This is the house.
Phil! The FBI is here!
Oh come in.
Thank you.
Sir I totally appreciate the confidentiality
your gym provides for its members
but this is a murder investigation so obviously--
Hello?
Uncooperative.
Kevin honey say something helpful.
I'm almost done with members and employees.
Outside venders are gonna be tough though.
It looks like a lot of these guys are paid under the table.
I know. W-2s are useless.
Look at original service records only.
What is this operating system you're working?
The search parameters are completely backwards.
Ok first of all I created that program
and second of all it is a poor carpenter and hacker
who blames his tools.
Miss Garcia.
Paul Wilson's family is here for interviews.
But we're about to deliver the profile.
There's no one here to talk to them.
Well they're here.
Uh...Can--can you ask them to wait?
Ok.
Pen are you talking to me?
Kevin compile.
Detective?
Yeah?
I'm sorry. I'll talk to them.
Oh I miss you JJ.
This unsub is an emasculated alpha male
with a near obsessive-compulsive
level of control in his behavior.
And because of the repetition of details
at the crime scenes we know that his ritual is essential to him.
These patterns are how he maintains dominance
in a world he feels powerless in
both sexually and socially.
The man we're looking for is a troilist.
Do you know what that is?
It means that he gets off
on staging a scene and participating in it.
Such as recording sexual acts on camera
or coming to parties like yours.
The point is the performance.
Do you know who his partner is?
Uh partner?
When he comes to the parties.
He has to bring a female companion
or he wouldn't get in the door.
See swing clubs are a matriarchy.
My primary goal as a hostess
is to make sure other women feel safe and secure.
There has to be at least as many women as men.
Actually we hadn't considered that.
What else do you know about him?
Paul Wilson's attack showed him
how physically weak he was
and Debra Wilson's enticement reminded him of how futile his fantasies were.
And as a result of this
this unsub is what we call decompensating.
Now what does that mean?
We use it to describe the collapse
of OCD patterns that mentally ill patients use to cope.
Once one fails they generally all do.
In this case the unsub's ritualized fantasy has stopped working
and that makes him incredibly dangerous.
So what was his fantasy?
Two men one woman-- how would that work?
Well he comes with his female companion.
Then he'd most likely invite a man in.
Wait a minute.
This guy is an alpha male.
Wouldn't he be too possessive to share his partner?
Sure. Unless he was married.
Well why married?
Oh because the erotic charge of the role play
is the consensual cheating.
You don't control a girlfriend the way you control a wife.
The husband chooses his wife's partner for her.
Usually not married.
It makes the cheating hotter.
Then at a certain point
he steps in.
And shows his sexual superiority.
He proves to the room and his wife that he's the only one
who can satisfy her.
Until his impotence destroyed his ability to do that.
Suddenly he's not the only one questioning his manhood
she is too.
So maybe she cheated on him or maybe she left
but either way his wife was his first loss of control.
And if he's decompensating
she's the pattern he'll attack next as part of his breakdown.
Her or women like her.
The end result of decompensation
is a temporary psychotic break.
He'll revisit old patterns to see if they still work.
And when he finds that they don't
he'll be compelled to destroy them
and anyone engaging in them.
How are you?
Oh excuse me.
Hello Leslie.
James.
What a pleasant surprise.
Where's your wife?
Maryann's coming later.
Well you know the rules of my house.
She's right behind me.
I swear.
Well she better be.
Are you almost done?
I can't look at this any longer.
Almost ma'am.
The gunman tonight did you know him?
James.
He and his wife Maryann were fixtures here a year ago.
Then they just stopped coming.
Do you have a last name?
No. We don't share personal details like that.
So you have sex
but you don't ask for last names?
All of the victims here tonight were men.
Do you happen to know why?
No.
Do you know if he had the chance
to shoot any women?
I was in the playroom with my friend.
And we locked the door when the shooting started.
And he came in
and he just looked at me like I was nothing.
So no no I have no idea what he was after.
I'm just glad it wasn't me.
Ms. Sanders if the door was locked
how did he get in?
This was the last victim.
The unsub came from the living room into here.
Morgan says the hostess locked herself in here.
It didn't seem to slow him down.
This is a deadbolt.
The unsub could have easily shot his way through.
He picked the lock?
He'd only do that out of habit.
The deadbolt's designed for security.
It takes expertise to get past that.
You think he's a locksmith?
We knew he was stalking his victims at the Gym
but we never knew how he got into their lives.
But when you're working out
where's the one place you leave everything personal?
In a locker.
Once the unsub finds an alpha male
he can pick the lock
get their address off their driver's license
and duplicate their keys in his work van outside.
That's the missing piece to his M.O.
He got everything he needed
from these men before they left the shower.
Garcia's already ruled out Gym employees and members.
How's he getting in?
Could be a third-party vendor
called in to install the lockers.
And called back when someone loses their key.
All right. Come back to the station. We'll work this up.
Garcia I need you to pull all the locksmiths
that the Gym contracts out to.
Oh that's gonna take some time.
Why?
Because I'm still gathering the vendors
and not all the websites list the trainers that work there.
Did you call them?
Of course I called them.
But some were cooperative and some weren't so I--
Garcia I told you to come to me if you got stuck.
Look you know usually I can do this kind of thing in no time
but this office is a revolving door of people bugging me
and I cannot do two jobs at once!
Oh my God sir I'm so sorry.
Garcia there are 8 new victims as of tonight
and more people are going to die.
I need you to shut out all distractions
and give me everything you've got.
Yes sir. I'm here. I'm present. Hit me.
The unsub's a locksmith. I need employee rolls--
of lock and key companies. I'm so on it.
Thank you.
Hotch.
Yeah.
We need to rethink this unsub's decompensation.
We thought his wife would be the next logical target
especially if she left him
but if it's other men he could blame them
for breaking up his marriage.
It's the same thought process
that started him hunting alpha males to begin with.
And what does that tell us about where he might be going?
Nothing. But it might tell us where he's been.
Decompensation means he's returning to his old patterns
his old habits.
Maybe he did this before.
After his wife left he sought out some of her partners and killed them.
You want to look at unsolved murders?
Crowley can pull them for us
match them based on the unsub's caliber.
Good. You might also need to
give Garcia a hand working the locksmith angle.
Is there some reason she can't cover that on her own?
She's juggling two jobs. She might need some help.
Yeah. Yeah I appreciate that. Thank you for the information.
Ok. Bye-bye.
How are you holding up?
Um the Gyms found out about the massacre
so now they're giving me information on the locksmiths
and that's a whole other can of worms. And...
I'm fine.
Garcia...
Morgan people are going to die because of me.
That's not true.
Yes it is.
JJ did so much.
I am in so over my head
I'm swimming-- oh my God I hate these things.
Here let me help.
Take them out. Where's your saline?
Front pocket of my bag.
You know what your only mistake has been since you started?
Oh hooray. More criticism.
You are trying to replace JJ.
Nobody can replace JJ.
Now take the other one out too.
I'm not trying to replace her.
I'm trying to do this job the way she'd want it done.
You know what JJ would want?
She'd want you to find a way
to do this job on your own terms.
Play to your strengths.
Ok all my extensive knowledge
of operating systems and Internet protocol
is not really gonna help me out here.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
You need to go O.G.
Original Garcia.
Derek Morgan I'm a little blind right now
but it appears the rough blur that is you
just threw out my only pair of contact lenses.
There she is.
I know you.
How often do I tell you I love you?
Every day. It's implied.
Now...The locksmiths.
Can I help?
You just did.
I know what to do.
Deacon's lock and key. This is Deacon.
Hello. This is Penny Garcia. I'm with the phone company.
I paid this month.
Oh we're the phone company so we know that.
I'm calling because one of your employees is past due
and he listed you as his most recent employer.
I don't have any employees.
Well that settles that then.
I'm just going to turn this over to the irs.
No wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I have a few guys I free-lance out to.
Who are you looking for?
Well I'm glad you asked 'cause this is my pickle.
I have a gentleman that uses a bunch of different last names
but he keeps using the same first name
James over and over.
And the password is Maryann on all of his accounts.
James Thomas.
He wouldn't happen to be working tonight would he?
Supposed to.
Didn't show.
Ok. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
I got it!
Got what?
The unsub.
His name is James Thomas.
He did work at all the gyms the husbands went to.
Is that not enough information? Oh I have so much more.
Last year he suffered from a condition called
prostatic hyperdysplasia. Routine surgery took a wrong turn
snip snip they had to remove the whole prostate tamale.
Boss says he didn't show up for work today but this...
Is his home address.
Garcia you should have let me know
before you contacted his employer.
Otherwise well done.
We need a SWAT team at this address.
I'm on it.
Yes.
FBI! We're coming in!
Clear.
Clear.
All clear.
Show me your hands.
Who are you?
Maryann Thomas.
James Thomas' wife?
Where's your husband?
I don't know! He left for work this morning.
There's a gun locker in the closet. It's empty.
Get up. You're gonna help us find him.
Please tell me what this is about.
This is who your husband has killed so far.
Recognize that last crime scene?
That's Leslie Sanders' house
where you and James used to swing.
James is not a...
He wouldn't do that.
He would Maryann.
He would because he knows he's not the father of your baby.
That's not true. James is the father.
She's not going to give him up.
She's the wife of an alpha male.
She depends on him psychologically.
Is there any chance that the unsub is the father?
Garcia said the prostate surgery was over a year ago
and there's no record of insemination.
So how do we get her to admit it?
We need to ground her back into reality
give her something to hold on to for truth.
Did you get those files we asked for
the unsolved murders?
Yeah. I can have them here in 5 minutes.
Great thanks. If the unsub did kill someone in those files
it's most likely the father of her child.
If it's an old swinging partner he'd be easy to track down.
That's risky. If we show her the files and he's not in there
we could lose her for good.
Yeah but if the father is in there
it could shake her loose.
That baby is the only
thing she would prioritize over her husband.
I think I can do it. I can get her to cooperate.
How?
Right now two alpha males are in there
attacking her marriage. She'll react the same way
to anyone challenging her husband's dominance.
But I'm not a threat. I think she'll listen to me.
So I read this pretty fascinating theory recently.
It said that humans weren't designed to be monogamous
that in our hunter-gatherer phase
women took several mates.
The idea was that if the men in the tribe
didn't know who the father was
they'd all be more invested in the child.
Interesting right?
I guess.
Truthfully your lifestyle
is um it's a sociological marvel.
Don't get me wrong. I don't judge it or you.
But I do think that the only reason you got into that
was to make your husband happy.
Just like you only got pregnant after his surgery
to make him happy
only I don't think that it's working.
That's not true.
James is overjoyed to be a father.
So he didn't change around like
month 4 or 5 of the pregnancy
when you started to show?
He didn't get moody or withdrawn or anything?
How about last night
when he came home with cuts and bruises?
Didn't you ask him about that?
No.
So Maryann I know this is hard to hear
but I think that your pregnancy
drove your husband to try to recreate those parties
so he could feel in control again.
Only instead of swinging
he's killing people.
Why won't you people listen to me?
He's not capable of doing that.
How about killing the man who got you pregnant?
Do you think he's capable of that?
No.
Because you'd be lying.
This is his baby.
These files are recent unsolved murders
men who have been killed since you conceived.
Now if I'm right about your husband
I think that the father of your child is somewhere in here.
Bob Atkins? Is it him?
I can't believe this.
James Boyd?
You don't give up do you?
You just can't accept the fact that my husband and I
love each other.
Yes we have an unconventional marriage
but that's not a crime.
We have a strong relationship.
James respects me.
He would never do anything--
It went straight to voice mail.
He must have turned it off.
Maryann we need you to tell us
what you and your husband used to do before you got married.
What your habits were.
You mean like where we went on dates?
No your sexual habits.
Think of it. You don't just jump into swinging.
Most people have games building up to it.
What were they?
He'd sometimes pretend to pick me up.
What does that mean?
We'd meet at a bar.
I'd arrive and he wouldn't be there.
He was in the back watching me.
What were the names of the bars you went to?
Just one. Dunley's. It's at the town mall.
And how did the game end?
He'd make me dress provocatively.
He wanted guys to hit on me
and then when I'd show some interest--
James would step in seduce you back to him?
He's in the middle of the bar.
There's no way to take him down
without risking collateral damage.
If we go in there he'll start shooting up the place.
He'll do that anyway.
This guy's looking for a spark.
Then we'll need a distraction.
What are you doing?
He's gone back to his old patterns.
He wants to play the game he played with his wife.
Debra Wilson played that game and it got her killed Prentiss.
All right keep his focus off the crowd
long enough for us to take him down.
You guys better have my back.
We will.
James.
Hey! I thought that was you.
How's Maryann?
Oh you don't remember me do you?
We met at a-- a party.
We did?
Yeah. That was a--
that was a crazy night.
I'll bet it was.
Emily.
Um it was Halloween.
Ok tell me if this rings a Bell.
Uh you asked if we were interested in Maryann
and then you and I watched for a while
and then you joined in.
Brian didn't stop talking about that for weeks.
Look look look look.
I'm sorry I really don't remember you.
It's ok.
So do you still hit the scene?
No I don't.
Hmm. Yeah me neither.
I came tonight uh
hoping to find a real man.
Lucky for me I found you.
So we have met?
So where's Brian?
Oh he's not around anymore.
Yeah. Well that happens.
Lose your boyfriend.
The scene will definitely do that.
You know I'm not that torn up about it.
There'll be other boyfriends.
You know there's only uh
only one way to make the lifestyle really work.
You gotta choose someone who's stable.
Who's uh secure.
In fact Maryann and I have a uh
little secret system we worked out.
You want to know what that is?
I always choose husbands for her...
Never boyfriends.
I don't know you.
And you don't know me.
Move move.
FBI! Nobody move!
The situation is under control. You're not in danger.
You need help?
Are you all right?
Tell...Tell...Tell Maryann...
Tell Maryann...
I will.

Garcia...
Sir I'm scanning the open case files.
My plan is to have this office paperless in a month.
That can wait.
When Gideon left the BAU
I found myself taking on too much responsibility.
And I quickly realized that
I could only do the job that I was good at.
I've seen you give everything to this case and to this team
for the last few days
but the truth is we need you here.
Oh thank God.
Sir I do not want that job. I mean--
I want part of the job.
I want the part that keeps me here
'cause here I'm Mozart
but out there I was like a monkey playing the trumpet
and you guys need Mozart.
You did fine.
What if we split up the job?
You can handle intake and resources here at Quantico
we can cover the rest in the field
and when we need you you'll still travel with us.
You can do that?
Of course.
But I let you down.
In no way whatsoever.
I kind of lost my marbles out there.
Garcia when you applied for this job
you gave me your resume on homemade pink stationery.
I realized then that you were...Unique.
And I wouldn't want you to change that.
Good night.
