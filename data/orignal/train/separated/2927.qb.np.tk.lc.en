there &apos;s this woman that i like a lot .
but it &apos;s complicated .
she was with this other guy for a long time .
i could never do that to the guy . we &apos;re friends .
so this guy she used to go out with , is he a good guy ?
the best .
then talk to him .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s worth finding out , if you like her .
i do , so much .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about her . i can &apos;t sleep ..
you know what ? you have to go for it .
how often does this happen to you ? you owe it to yourself .
it &apos;s rachel .
i &apos;m sorry , did you just say it &apos;s rachel ?
yes .
you like rachel ?
yes . i like rachel .
rachel ? !
yeah . okay , but look , you know ..
you know who else i like ? you .
and it doesn &apos;t get said enough . i like you , ross .
&quot; rachel &quot; rachel ?
it &apos;s not a big deal .
it &apos;s not a big deal ? i &apos;m sorry , i just ..
what about the stuff you said ?
how you can &apos;t stop thinking about her ? how you can &apos;t sleep ?
i &apos;m an actor , you know ?
as a group , we tend to be overdramatic .
rachel @-@ who &apos;s @-@ carrying @-@ my @-@ baby rachel ?
i know it &apos;s bad . and i know it &apos;s wrong , okay ?
it &apos;s not like anything &apos;s ever gonna happen .
these are just feelings . they &apos;ll go away .
you know , i gotta go .
hey , ross ..
you know , i just have one-- rachel ? !
rachel ? !
the.one.where.joey.tells.rachel
okay , she &apos;s kicking .
she &apos;s growing inside you .
that was a big one .
that &apos;s the youngest girl to reject me .
you guys !
hey there .
let me ask you . do you believe in soul mates ?
oh , yes , i do .
there &apos;s one person out there for everyone .
you know how you find him ? stop looking .
i &apos;ve stopped looking for russell crowe .
he &apos;ll find me .
and you ?
no . i believe that certain people are more suited for each other , but ..
soul mates ? i don &apos;t think they exist .
good .
why ?
well , last night , i met monica &apos;s .
what ?
i had a date with this guy . i swear he &apos;s her other half .
you don &apos;t think there &apos;s somebody better suited for monica than me ?
well , what &apos;s he like ?
he &apos;s tall . he has brown hair .
of course .
a tall guy with hair similar to mine ? oh , unknowable universe !
he works with food .
oh , sure . older ?
obviously . and he &apos;s british .
i was just gonna ask !
and he &apos;s so centered , and mature and confident .
it &apos;s so sad they never met .
luckily , the guy she settled for can &apos;t hear you .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry . maybe i &apos;m wrong .
we &apos;re going out again . i &apos;ll find out more .
he &apos;s meant for her , and you &apos;re gonna date him ?
he may not be my soul mate , but a girl &apos;s gotta eat .
rachel ? !
i didn &apos;t know joey was on jag .
hey .
hey .
i talked to joey . i wanted to see you .
i still can &apos;t believe it . joey and rachel ?
it &apos;s like you and me going out , only weirder .
i know you &apos;re hurting ..
but don &apos;t say that again .
what if they marry ? he &apos;d be the stepfather of my child .
you don &apos;t need to worry .
he &apos;ll never tell her how he feels .
if he did , you don &apos;t know how she &apos;d react .
sure , women never like joey . i think he &apos;s a virgin .
he isn &apos;t thinking about going for her .
he &apos;s not ?
all he &apos;s thinking about is how you &apos;re taking this .
it &apos;s freaking him out . he wants to move to vermont .
why ?
he wants to leave the country .
he thinks you hate him .
hate him ?
no , i don &apos;t hate him .
it &apos;s just , it &apos;s rachel . you know ?
i can &apos;t even imagine how hard this must be for you ..
but i don &apos;t want you to lose joey over it .
right now , he needs to know that you &apos;re still his friend .
okay , i &apos;ll talk to him .
i &apos;d do it soon .
he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money .
hi !

if you &apos;re talking about me , i &apos;ll go with you .
i &apos;ll have a mocha @-@ ccino .
what are you doing ?
i swear , i didn &apos;t know you guys would be here .
you don &apos;t believe in soul mates , so ..
i believe in handsome strangers who hit on my wife .
just because i think they &apos;re soul mates doesn &apos;t mean anything &apos;ll happen .
phoebe ? good work .
he &apos;s great . i love him .
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll find you someone else .
i understand if you came by to hit me . i deserve it .
no , i don &apos;t want to hit you .
what , then ? kick me ?
no .
bite me ?
i don &apos;t want to do anything to you .
i just want to say i &apos;m not mad at you ..
and that i certainly do not hate you .
i just came here to say that .
hey , wait , ross ?
you wanna come in for a beer or something ?
yeah , sure .
you got any beer ?
all i got is melon stuff that rachel left .
okay .
you need to understand something .
i am never gonna act on this rachel thing , okay ?
i wouldn &apos;t do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you .
thank you .
anyway , it &apos;ll just ..
it &apos;ll take me a while to get over her .
i &apos;m not sure how to do that . i &apos;ve never been in love , so ..
what ?
you &apos;re in love with her ?
yeah . i thought you knew that .
no .
look , if it helps , i don &apos;t want to feel this way , honest .
i just keep thinking , &quot; i &apos;ll get over this , &quot; you know ?
but it just keeps getting harder .
i don &apos;t know what to do , you know ?
what do i do ?
you need to tell her how you feel .
that &apos;s the green stuff talking .
i &apos;m serious . you need to find out where she is .
if she &apos;s not where you are , you can start to move on .
but what if , and i &apos;m not saying she will be ..
if she is where you are ..
then my feeling weird shouldn &apos;t stand in the way .
are you sure ?
yeah .
if she ends up with somebody else ..
the truth is , she couldn &apos;t find a better guy .
hey , thanks .
so when are you gonna talk to her ?
oh , my god . i have to tell her .
i haven &apos;t thought about it . what should i say ?
i &apos;m understanding , but let &apos;s not get carried away .
what am i gonna say ?
yeah , tell me about it .
i &apos;m phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese .
cheese , you say ?
that &apos;s some pretty smelly work , huh , don ?
excuse me ?
cheese . it &apos;s smelly .
you must smell a lot of the time too .
not really . but with cheese , i think the smellier , the better .
me too ! chandler hates it . i can &apos;t have blue cheese in the house .
and you &apos;re still married to him ?
i would like to go to france and eat nothing but bread and cheese .
not even bread . just cheese .
no , i want the bread .
and pastries .
and pate .
i &apos;m really not high . i just used to be fat .
i have a villa in the loire valley you can stay in .
is it made of cheese ?
no . a house made of cheese , wouldn &apos;t that be incredible ?
i &apos;d move in tomorrow !
oh , come on !
listen to this !
i &apos;m so sorry .
what do we do ?
they both want a house of cheese .
i don &apos;t know how you fight that .
okay , okay . i can do this . i can tell her how i feel .
okay , stand up straight .
take a couple deep breaths .
look confident .
joey ? what &apos;s up ?
i came by because i want to talk to you about something .
what &apos;s up ?
here , in the hall ? what are we , animals ?
i &apos;m late for a meeting . could you make it quick ?
i just came by to tell you that ..
i want to have dinner with you .
sure . just tell me where to meet you .
okay . that &apos;s good .
that gives you a couple of hours to prepare .
don &apos;t you people ever knock ?
i &apos;d like to have don and phoebe over . wouldn &apos;t that be nice ?
sure . set it up .
i &apos;ll just be browsing through the personals .
are you okay ? you &apos;re acting weird .
yeah . fine . not perfect .
but good enough .
jeez , what &apos;s with you ?
i &apos;m sorry , did you say &quot; cheese &quot; ?
what &apos;s going on ?
phoebe says you and don are soul mates .
i don &apos;t believe in that , but you two get along .
i &apos;ll step aside if you wanna go with don and live in a house of cheese .
you don &apos;t believe in soul mates ?
no , but i &apos;m sure &quot; tomahtoes &quot; does .
i don &apos;t believe in soul mates , either .
you don &apos;t ?
nope .
we weren &apos;t destined to end up together .
we fell in love and work hard at our relationship .
some days we work really hard .
so you don &apos;t want to live with don in a cheese house ?
no , i &apos;ve had second thoughts . do you know how hard it &apos;d be to clean ?
i love you .
i know .
i &apos;m gonna take you out to dinner .
i found this place that makes the greatest jalapeno poppers .
no ? they taste so good .
it happens whenever chandler touches my stomach .
i &apos;m worried the baby won &apos;t like him .
are you okay ?
yeah , sure .
look , the reason ..
is it hot in here ?
why don &apos;t you take off your sweater ?
this is a nice place ..
and my t @-@ shirt has a picture of calvin doing hobbes .
oh , my god , really ? can i see it ?
yeah , sure .
i wouldn &apos;t think hobbes would like that so much .
