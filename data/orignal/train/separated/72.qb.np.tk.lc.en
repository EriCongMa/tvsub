i &apos;m not sure .
you &apos;re not ... sure ?
i don &apos;t know how to answer .
with the truth .
i have an obligation .
no . you &apos;re a private investigator .
you don &apos;t have attorney @-@ client privilege .
here &apos;s the problem , kalinda .
the irs is investigating you because of this check .
$ 3,850 .
it was written from what they determine is a dummy account ,
and now they want accounting for
all your freelance work over the last three tax periods .
so ... you need to answer for these checks .
answer for ... ?
what the nature of the work was and who paid for it .
so let &apos;s start with this check .
$ 2,460 paid out by frp incorporated
for three days &apos; work .
what was the nature of that work and who paid for it ?
look ... i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t mean to be guarded here .
but you are being guarded here .
yes , but the difficulty is ,
is that i did this work for someone you know , and ...
i think it would be unfair to them to divulge it .
it &apos;s not who you think .
and who do i think ?
one second .
hi .
diane , do you have a minute ?
i did the work for diane .
well ... why wasn &apos;t it paid through lockhart / gardner
well , it &apos;s not a work matter .
um , i &apos;d rather stick to generalities here .
okay . uh , so how would you define this work ?
firearm lessons .
well , that helps .
oh , uh , diane wants to talk to you .
okay , thanks .
we &apos;re gonna have to go over the other checks , but ...
i will try to stick to generalities .
thanks . um , i &apos;ll try to get permission .
i just got a call
asking me to sit on a blue ribbon panel ,
经过专业 、 客观的分析得出结论和建议供决策参考
and , uh , as you can see , i &apos;m , uh , fairly busy .
it &apos;s a routine civilian review of an ipra ,
independent police review authority .
it &apos;s a police shooting .
they asked for a replacement ,
and i suggested you .
me ? uh , wouldn &apos;t they want someone with more experience ?
no . what they want is a woman .
well ...
i mean , this happens lot .
they go fishing at the last minute for a balance ,
uh , republican or a woman .
i mean , it &apos;s good for your career and the firm .
you work with judges and influential lawyers .
yes . thank you , i would love to , diane .
good . i &apos;ll give them a call .
and ... thank you for my salary bump .
yes . i hear you &apos;re buying a house .
well , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m making an offer today .
good .
they were out of town so he gave me his tickets .
unbelievable-- best seats i &apos;ve ever had .
practically courtside .
really ?
he &apos;s got the best seats in the center .
i &apos;m telling you ,
i have never been so close to the action ...
so you &apos;re the woman .
oh , i guess i am .
i &apos;m the black .
mike , how are you !
pastor damon , i &apos;m so glad you could make it .
i have a tape of one of your sermons running in my car .
now , that is dangerous .
and you know his honor peter dunaway .
nice to see you again .
and his equally @-@ honorable harvey winter .
okay , we &apos;re gonna have to cut that out
or you &apos;re gonna be honoring it up all day .
gentlemen , it &apos;s good to meet you .
chicago , to my mind ,
has the best justice money can buy .
alicia florrick .
now , this truly is an honor .
mike kresteva , of sellers , kresteva &amp; landry .
thank you for doing this .
oh , no , no . thank you for the invite .
although i have to admit i feel a little ... outclassed .
ah . well , here &apos;s the trick .
without the robes , these judges are just pussycats .
isn &apos;t that so , harvey ?
whatever he said about me , he &apos;s lying .
you &apos;ve been in my court-- ms ....
florrick .
i see .
a woman and a connection to the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
nice bank shot , mike .
and i believe you know
the incredibly handsome harvey winter .
i &apos;m a friend of your husband &apos;s , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;m glad to see he &apos;s thriving .
thank you .
well , i think that &apos;s all of us .
shall we get started ?
we ask you , lord ,
to give us a strong mind and discerning spirit .
we ask that the witnesses answer honestly and completely .
and , as always , we ask that your truth guide us in all things .
in jesus &apos; name we pray .
amen .
thank you , paster .
we are reviewing
ipra packet log number 166616,
officer @-@ involved shooting
at the addison l platform .
you &apos;ll find your packet in front of you .
as blue ribbon panel chair , i would ask
for standard five @-@ minute questioning periods for all panelist .
all those in favor ?
aye .
all those opposed ?
motion passes . i would also advise
that we confine the witness list to the four witnesses
in the ipra report .
all those in favor ?
aye .
all those opposed ?
good . well , then i would suggest we call our first witness .
how &apos;s it going down there , mrs. florrick ?
just trying to catch up .
you &apos;re doing just fine .
we were working undercover .
there were a series of holdups ,
female passengers at north side el platforms .
officer trina coffey and myself were tasked with a decoy detail .
and you came across a perp ?
yes .
a two @-@ time felon .
he tried to hold up officer coffey .
we announced ourselves as police officers , pulled our firearms ,
threw him to the ground , and that &apos;s when i saw ...
at the end of the platform ,
a man advancing towards us with a handgun .
and this was the victim , roland masters ?
i yelled &quot; gun . &quot;
my partner ...
uh , officer coffey ...
turned and fired on the ...
on mr. masters .
and unfortunately , mr. masters saw your undercover clothes
and thought you were trying to mug this thief .
yes .
he was being a good samaritan .
but you thought he was another perp trying to shoot you .
thank you , officer .
i &apos;m sorry you have to go through this .
any questions , your honor dunaway ?
yes , uh , just one .
you identified yourselves as police officers ?
yes .
so why do you think the victim kept advancing on you ?
my guess is , he didn &apos;t hear us .
there was an express train on the facing track .
he probably didn &apos;t hear us over the noise .
thank you , officer . nothing else .
your honor winter , five minutes .
no questions .
mr. adams , five minutes .
no questions .
mr. danforth ?
nothing .
pastor damon , five minutes .
no , i &apos;m fine .
mrs. florrick , five minutes .
i ...
no questions .
all by a show of hands ?
eight votes .
the motion to remove will gardner from name partnership
and replace him with david lee also fails .
this is all backward-- we should vote will out ,
then vote for a replacement .
that &apos;s not how we do things here .
because you know it &apos;ll pass .
this firm is limping
without a full lawyer as fellow name partner , diane .
you just want to have an equal vote with her .
i want there to be a balance of power at the top .
excuse me , gentlemen , unless you have more business ...
it &apos;s my understanding
mr. gardner &apos;s still a profit participant while suspended as a lawyer .
i move that ...
could someone put that into motion words for me ?
i move that will be precluded from sharing in any firm revenues
during the time in which he is not actively practicing law .
i second . call the question .
diane , can i have a word ?
no .
a name partner is asking for word .
you can have your vote afterward .
are they watching us ?
oh , yeah .
how am i looking ?
little more worried .
do you think this &apos;ll appease them , by giving them my profit ?
they &apos;re still coming after your seat .
as long as the three are divided , i &apos;m fine .
pretty soon they &apos;re gonna figure that out .
ronnie , i &apos;m sorry for your loss ,
but can you help us out here at all ?
it &apos;s just , you were the only witness on the platform .
you saw your father being shot ?
did he hear the police announce themselves ?
my dad ...
he helped everyone .
your dad helped everyone , is that what you said ?
didn &apos;t matter who you were .
anybody .
he give you money ...
he &apos;d ...
pastor .
son ...
i am so sorry ,
but the best way to honor you father
is to help us here .
did you hear the policeman yelling , &quot; police &quot; ?
you didn &apos;t ?
it was too noisy to hear ?
peter , do you have anything ? five minutes .
nothing here .
harvey ?
no questions . nothing here .
eric ?
i &apos;m good .
russ , any questions ?
nothing .
mrs. florrick ?
ronnie , officer zimmerman said
that there was an express train running on the facing track ,
and he thought that &apos;s why you and your dad didn &apos;t hear--
is that what happened ?
i know it &apos;s tough to be here , i know .
but this is about your dad ,
so ... tell me , just me .
is that what happened ?
no .
that &apos;s not why you didn &apos;t hear ?
then why didn &apos;t you ?
because ...
they didn &apos;t say anything .
the undercover officers didn &apos;t say anything ?
but you wouldn &apos;t have heard , anyway ,
because of the passing train .
no , no .
you could hear everything .
there wasn &apos;t any noise .
except the passing train .
there was a train that stopped .
it blocked out the sound , but the cops ...
the cops didn &apos;t say a thing .
they just ...
my dad ...
he went over to help ...
... and they shot him .
they killed him .
and no one ...
no one wants to believe me .
good work .
see you tomorrow .
tomorrow , huh ?
you bet .
mrs. florrick .
your honor .
i &apos;m out of the robes so just peter here .
you don &apos;t need to impress us .
i don &apos;t ?
you &apos;re here . you have a seat at the table .
that &apos;s impressing us enough .
you don &apos;t need to be clever .
oh , i didn &apos;t think i was .
your questioning .
everybody new to the panel
thinks they &apos;re gonna reinvent the wheel .
you don &apos;t have to .
it &apos;s a wheel , it works fine .
sorry i &apos;m late .
you didn &apos;t need me in there ?
no .
it went pretty fast . they said , &quot; no . &quot;
they want the asking price .
did you tell them i could offer a quick closing date ?
yeah . they wouldn &apos;t budge .
i can &apos;t do higher . i can &apos;t do the down payment .
there &apos;s something you can try . it sometimes works .
what &apos;s that ?
you can write a letter .
personal stationery , handwrite it ,
tell her what it would mean to move back in .
her ?
gilda , the wife . i think she &apos;s the one making the decions .
you have an advantage over the other offers ;
you lived here .
what the house means to me .
红线
so , officer coffey , what happened next ?
i heard my partner yell , &quot; gun . &quot;
i spun around and saw a man charging at us .
and that &apos;s why you fired ?
yes , sir .
thank you , ma &apos;am . i &apos;m finished .
pastor damon , five minutes .
no . i &apos;m , i &apos;m fine .
judge dunaway ?
nothing from me , mike .
russ ?
nothing .
eric ?
no questions .
mrs. florrick ? five minutes ?
yes , thank you .
you remember yelling you were police officers
when you threw the arrestee to the ground ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
and you remember an express train
racing through the station when you yelled &quot; police &quot; ?
yes , ma &apos;am , that &apos;s why the victim didn &apos;t hear us .
was there a stopped train on your track ?
yes , ma &apos;am , the 11 : 35 red line .
so ... didn &apos;t it block out the noise of the passing train ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand , ma &apos;am .
didn &apos;t the parked train block the noise of the passing train ?
no .
that &apos;s odd .
because i was there last night and i could hear ...
wait a minute ... mrs. florrick .
yes ?
that is not your position .
let &apos;s move this panel into executive session , please .
officer coffey , we &apos;ll call you back in a few minutes .
i wasn &apos;t there to investigate .
you just happened to be that paticular position last night ?
yes .
mr. chairman ,
i move that the panel censure mrs. florrick .
second .
excuse me .
i &apos;m not sure what i &apos;ve done wrong .
you went out and investigated .
i was there , i observed .
don &apos;t interrupt me . we are like a jury .
a jury can &apos;t investigate .
we &apos;re not the cops , honey .
it &apos;s true , mrs. florrick .
there &apos;s nothing in the rules exactly preventing us from investigating ,
but it &apos;s traditional that our review stick to the evidence on hand .
i didn &apos;t know that .
as you know , i am new to this .
good . well , i would advise against a censure .
but , now that we &apos;re all on the same page , shall we break for lunch ?
i am so sorry . i was held up .
i &apos;m sorry , ms. sharma .
that &apos;s quite all right , mrs. florrick .
it gave us time to get acquainted .
uh , mr. lesher , is it ?
yes . this is mr. finerman and mr. hark .
welcome to the internal revenue service .
we &apos;ve been reviewing your petition for an offer in compromise .
i &apos;m afraid we need more information .
okay , uh , well ,
why don &apos;t you tell us in greater detail what it is you need ,
and we &apos;ll be glad to supply it .
the exact names of ms. sharma &apos;s employers and the nature of the employment .
acally , that is in our petition .
i have more copies if you need them .
no , no , no . we reviewed it . it &apos;s very vague .
employment is listed as &quot; research &quot; or &quot; background check . &quot;
we need more specifics .
why ?
why do we need more specifics ?
yes .
i don &apos;t think we need to explain that .
ms. sharma is not being accused of breaking any laws
or exploiting any loopholes .
she was a passive recipient of
a check that you believe came from a dummy account , that &apos;s all .
that does not open her up to a fishing expedition .
now we have come here in good faith
to offer and compromise .
we did not come here to be shaken down for more .
we are not in the business of shaking down ,
but we need more specific information
as to the exact nature ...
what was that about ?
why even call us in if they weren &apos;t gonna offer and compromise ?
you got a little hot in there .
i did .
i seem to be banging my head against the bureaucratic wall today ,
and i don &apos;t like my time wasted in pointless meetings .
alicia , that wasn &apos;t the meeting .
it wasn &apos;t ? what do you mean ?
the laptop on the desk-- someone was watching us .
who ?
i have no idea , but ...
they want something from me .
if you want something from us , you call my office .
stop playing through intermediaries .
i lost my house . i &apos;m using it .
dear gilda ,
as you probably know ...
... i lived in your house before you .
i saw my children grow up there .
i saw ...
i &apos;m gonna get you !
i &apos;m gonna get you !
i saw my daughter walk for the first time there .
i saw ...
florrick refused to address troubling allegations
that he abused his office in order to protect his powerful friends .
florrick denied that he accepted sexual ...
what are you saying ?
what i &apos;m saying is that ...
will knew we were gonna to strip him of his profit participation ,
and they made it look like a struggle .
to what end ?
to throw us a bone .
so will can stay in his seat as name partner .
this is like everything else : it &apos;s about power .
and we are making it easy on them .
okay .
i &apos;m listening .
you want will &apos;s seat ,
david lee wants will &apos;s seat ,
and i want will &apos;s seat .
one of us has to give , or they benefit from our squabble .
then give . i already asked you to vote for me .
we flip a coin .
i win , you get your votes to support me .
you win ...
i get your votes .
honor among thieves .
heads .
hey , howard .
i can &apos;t understand why i can &apos;t get the corner office .
it &apos;s the closest one to the bathroom .
i don &apos;t decide that .
whatever happened to seniority ?
you on the cuesta case ?
am i ?
no , i &apos;m suspended .
i &apos;m not on any case .
oh , that &apos;s right .
just you and me .
we &apos;re the only ones not working .
you got any good porn sites ?
i &apos;m the ipra investigator , forrest burke .
we &apos;ve read your report , mr. burke ,
arguing that the allegation &apos;s not supported by sufficient evidence .
there have been questions here about the , um ,
the noise factor on the platform .
could you speak to that ?
well , i would expect some dispute .
this was an encounter that lasted eight seconds .
and i &apos;ve found that people
experience sound and sight radically differently
when there are chaotic conditions .
nothing further from me , mike .
harvey , anything ?
why don &apos;t we just jump right down to mrs. florrick ?
see if she has anything .
yes . thank you . just a few questions .
this gun the good samaritan had ...
a colt double eagle commander pistol .
yes .
i saw in your report that you checked to see
if it had been used in other crimes
yes , it &apos;s standard .
and it had been used in another crime .
or , least , the ballistics matched .
yes . there was a jewelry store robbery two years earlier .
the culprit was never apprehended ,
but he or she did fire off one round ,
and the recovered shell matched this gun .
and you didn &apos;t suspect the good samaritan ?
no .
guns get bought and sold on the street all the time .
so , this jewelry store hold up from two years earlier
did you take note of who the supervising officer was at the scene ?
did i take note ?
no . why ?
officer zimmerman ,
the undercover officer was the supervising cop ...
mrs. florrick , that is out of line .
what ? i don &apos;t get it .
i just find it curious .
you &apos;re suggesting that the gun was a drop gun .
that officer zimmerman retrieved it
from the jewelry robbery and planted it ...
i &apos;m merely asking a question .
in your review , did you look ...
mrs. florrick , your five minutes are up .
they &apos;re ... excuse me ,
but i spent two of those minutes arguing .
that was your choice . let &apos;s move on .
harvey you &apos;ve got five minutes . any questions ?
i do not .
mr. adams ?
nothing here .
mr. danforth ?
i &apos;m good , mike .
pastor damon , any questions ?
no , thank you .
but ...
i &apos;m giving my five minutes to mrs. florrick .
what ? you can &apos;t ...
we &apos;ve done it before .
i &apos;m giving my five minutes to mrs. florrick .
please continue , ma &apos;am .
have there been other times
where officers have used drop guns ?
do you know how ridiculous that is--
a cop would hold onto that gun for two years ?
i &apos;m just asking a question .
no , you &apos;re not
let &apos;s not play innocent , mrs. florrick .
you &apos;re trying to turn this into something .
no , i &apos;m trying to find out ...
this blows up into a race riot , and it &apos;s on your head .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
white officer a black victim-- come on .
that should have nothing to do with this .
and yet it does .
race is here .
and you want to kick that hornet &apos;s nest ?
ask diane what it looks like to piss off judges like this .
people like this .
dear gilda , i didn &apos;t know how to write this letter
till i went to your open house .
see ? look at that .
now you &apos;re a movie star .
grace florrick ,
big hollywood movie star .
cool !
oh , look at this .
it &apos;s grace kelly .
i should have got you to do this a long time ago .
yeah , you just like being dirty and sweaty !
no !
listen to me .
people are going to say a lot of things about your dad .
are they true ?
doesn &apos;t matter if they &apos;re true .
does to me . it does to mom .
okay , your dad loves you .
he loves you so much .
but whatever you have to say about your dad ,
you say it here .
now , to me .
you don &apos;t say it to anyone else , okay ?
see ? isn &apos;t this better than camping ?
you &apos;re such a girl scout .
yes , i am .
but you &apos;re still going to have to protect me .
i &apos;m so scared of lightening .
wait . did hear that ?
what ?
not funny . not funny .
i know you have no reason to choose my offer over others ,
but just know you will not find a more grateful
or loving occupant of your house .
he said that ?
yes .
he said there would be consequences for questioning more .
yeah , it sounds like mike confusing his carrots with his sticks .
but you &apos;ve been investigating on your own ?
who told you ?
who told me you were investigating ?
someone on the panel .
but that &apos;s confidential . they broke confidentiality .
so have you , by relating your conversation with mike .
no . that was after the session was over .
look , you want to know what to do ?
you &apos;re on the blue ribbon panel .
that &apos;s what you do .
you don &apos;t pull punches .
well , it &apos;s up to you .
i mean , you have a seat at the table .
that means more responsibility and consequences .
can they hurt your career ?
yes .
you have to weigh that .
okay . thank you .
would you like me to close the door ?
yes .
so they &apos; going to tax us ?
judges dunaway and winter .
we have two cases in front of them .
well , you put her on the panel .
alicia has to do her best .
it &apos;s easy to be idealistic on the sidelines , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , that &apos;s me-- peace prize material .
and , uh , you seem to have a new friend .
yeah .
early bird special .
he turned me on to it .
it &apos;s quite a deal .
hello ?
hi .
lana deley . i &apos;m with the federal bureau of investigation .
you suggested i contact you .
&quot; stop playing through inteediaries . &quot;
oh , right .
hi .
i thought you would call first .
yes , i thought i would , too .
then i decided against it .
so ...
kalinda ?
yes , kalinda .
what is the nature of this investigation ?
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know ?
yes .
sometimes i just get an itch .
okay , so i &apos;m , um ... i &apos;m sorry .
what was your name again ?
lana delaney .
you ys represent lemond bishop , don &apos;t you ?
oh .
so that &apos;s what this is about-- lemond bishop ?
no . i &apos;m just asking a question .
yes , we represent him .
and has kalinda sharma ever done freelance work for him ?
do you have proof that she has ?
how long have you known kalinda ?
why ?
just curious .
you &apos;re friends , aren &apos;t you ?
you know , i think you should call first ,
ms. delaney , the next time you want to drop by my office .
then we can get everything on the record .
okay .
tell kalinda hi for me .
mr. burke ?
mrs. florrick , uh , hello .
i &apos;m sorry to come here without an appointment .
oh , just a sec . i &apos;m sorry , mr. burke . hello ?
my gosh , what an amazing letter .
i was crying !
uh ... gilda ?
yes . tears !
it had me bawling .
i remember my first house .
it was exactly like at .
uh , kalinda , wait a sec .
i &apos;m so sorry , mr. burke .
i just don &apos;t have that much time . i &apos;m on lunch break .
of course , we &apos;ll consider your offer , mrs. florrick .
oh , thank you .
i have two kids , too .
i come from a big family . and i always told myself ,
&quot; listen to moms . &quot;
oh , i &apos;m so glad , because i wasn &apos;t ...
i wasn &apos;t sure i was doing the right thing by writing the letter and ...
um , kalinda , the fbi was here for you .
for me ? who ?
agent delaney .
it was definitely the right thing to do .
in fact , i want you to know we have a bigger offer--
someone who offered our asking price--
but i &apos;d rather you have the house .
oh i ... well , i &apos;m so thrilled to hear that .
mrs. florrick .
i checked the drop gun . i checked what you mentioned ...
so we &apos;re giving you a chance to top their offer .
not even by that much ; just a little .
what ?
we so want you to have the house .
we just need you top the offer we have .
okay . thank you .
so we &apos;ll expect your call ?
yep . good @-@ bye .
what did you need , mr. burke ?
and with that , i think we have heard the lion &apos;s share of the evidence ,
so unless there are any more motions ...
there is one , sir-- mr. chair .
i move that we recall investigator forrest burke .
we &apos;ve already heard from him , mrs. florrick .
yes , but it is my understanding that he has new evidence .
really ?
and how did it become your understanding ?
he came to my workplace .
he said the chair rejected his request to testify here again .
first of all , mrs.lorrick ,
you are far out of line here .
in fact , i don &apos;t even think there is a line ...
but is it true ?
mr. burke did come to me
and asked if we needed more from him , and i said we did not .
he discovered officer zimmerman took a gun
from the jewelry store robbery into evidence ,
but never inventoried it .
mrs. florrick , that is not yours to assert .
correct . it is mr. burke &apos;s .
we have heard enough from mr. burke .
i move that we recall .
okay , fine .
that &apos;s the way we do things here .
all those in favor of mrs. florrick &apos;s motion
to recall mr. burke , please signify by saying , &quot; aye . &quot;
aye .
aye .
five to two .
unfortunately , you need a majority .
aye .
i &apos;m here to determine the truth .
i can &apos;t do that unless i listen to everything .
aye .
aye .
i &apos;m not bitter .
bitterness is for losers .
you tell me-- why should i give someone else a leg up , huh ?
i see you &apos;re busy here .
no , no . david , what do you need ?
howard , do you mind ?
oh , sure .
push me here , push me there .
right . take two steps that way .
sorry to interrupt your schmoozing ,
but do you know that diane is digging this firm &apos;s grave
because of her loyalty to you ?
no . i didn &apos;t know that .
will , i always liked you .
i thought you were smart .
but this firm is not owned by you or diane ,
and she is treating it like it is .
she &apos;s not making smart business or legal decisions .
and what are the smart decisions ?
she needs help at the top .
she is overwhelmed ,
and she can &apos;t ask for help because she &apos;s holding the spot for you .
you want me to support you to replace me ?
no . i want you to tell diane
to make smart decisions not based on loyalty .
alicia , i &apos;m so thrilled .
but why didn &apos;t you go through me ?
marina . what ?
why didn &apos;t you do the sales contract through me ?
what sales contract ?
for the house .
i saw it cross my desk .
but why did you use shirley ?
i didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t get the house .
i couldn &apos;t beat the offer .
well , i &apos;m looking at the file right here .
&quot; florricks . &quot; i mean , how many florricks are there ?
two .
two florricks .
oh , i see-- your husband .
that &apos;s great .
you got the house .
congratulations .
alicia ? hello ?
why are you doing this ?
doing what ?
holding my seat for me .
do you want me not to ?
i don &apos;t want you holding my seat
out of some misguided sense of loyalty .
well , you &apos;d do the same .
no , i wouldn &apos;t .
no , you would , because it &apos;s smart .
david lee , julius and eli are children
who have been told they can &apos;t have a toy ,
which makes them want it even more .
but if they got it , they would just break it ,
which is why we have to keep it out of their reach .
good .
as long as you &apos;re doing it because it &apos;s smart .
always .
i think julius is joining forces with eli .
yes , they &apos;ve requested another partner vote .
any ideas ?
one .
really ? well , let &apos;s hear it .
peter , when you get this , can you call my cell ?
i need to talk to you about something as soon as you can .
i just wish , if accusations of a drop gun were made ,
they &apos;d be made to my face .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t say they &apos;ve risen to the level of accusations .
they &apos;re just ... provocative questions .
now , you were questioned
about a drop gun , weren &apos;t you , officer ?
yes .
and when was that ?
after the ipra investigation ,
i was questioned by the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
by whom ...
in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
asa matan brody and deputy asa cary agos .
and they decided not to prosecute ?
yes , they took their findings to the state &apos;s attorney , peter florrick ,
and he decided there wasn &apos;t enough to prosecute .
but you could see
why i would take these charges of a gun drop with some sense of outrage .
of course you wanted him back .
so you could lay this at the feet of my husband ,
and i would have to recuse myself .
oh , no , you &apos;re not going to recuse yourself .
in fact , i move this panel deny any recusal .
mrs. florrick , this is not about you .
your questions have woken up this panel to its duty .
we &apos;re just following the evidence where it takes us ,
and if it takes us to
an inappropriate decision in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
so be it .
so we question the asa who questioned officer zimmerman .
there you are .
here i am .
oh , you wanted to get my attention
i don &apos;t want you to get the wrong idea , kalinda .
the irs caht your little freelance problem .
i just picked up the ball .
and where are you carrying this ... ball ?
let &apos;s have diner , and we can talk .
no . let &apos;s talk here .
no , it &apos;s too crowded here .
i know a nice , intimate restaurant off lincoln .
why don &apos;t we do intimate here ?
kalinda , i asked you to join me at the fbi .
you wouldn &apos;t be having any problems now ,
but you decided to stick it out at lockhart / gardner .
mm . kalinda !
you have such pretty lips .
what are you doing ?
why do we have to wait till dinner ?
why not here ?
kalinda .
what &apos;s wrong ?
kiss me .
okay , just so you know ,
this is not the way you handle this meeting .
and just so you know ,
if you want to talk about business ,
let &apos;s talk about business .
if you want to talk about something else ,
we can talk about something else .
just don &apos;t mix the two .
yes , we interviewed officers zimmerman and coffey
two weeks ago ?
do you asked them about the possibility of a drop gun ?
yes . we discovered that officer zimmerman had been present at
an earlier crime scene where no gun had been recovered and inventoried .
and the worry was that officer zimmerman had taken the gun
into his own possession and never inventoried it ?
yes .
but you didn &apos;t go any further with these accusations ?
no .
um , after consulting with the state &apos;s attorney ...
peter florck ?
yes . after consulting , we decided
that this was probably an unfortunate coincidence .
did the racial makeup of the officers and the victim
enter into this decision at all ?
not my decision .
no .
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s decision ?
i can &apos;t answer that .
why ?
well , because i don &apos;t know , your honor .
but it would not be in the interest of the state &apos;s attorney
to pursue a racially @-@ charged prosecution
on the eve of his announcement for a run for governor ?
i can &apos;t answer that , but can be offended by that .
who else was in the meeting , deputy asa agos ?
uh , just to correct you , i &apos;m no longer a deputy .
i &apos;ve been demoted .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
who else was in the meeting when you consulted on not
pursuing the drop gun evidence ?
who else ? myself and the state &apos;s attorney .
anyone else ?
yes .
and who was that ?
mr. eli gold .
and who is that ?
i believe he &apos;s a crisis consultant .
and at one point ,
peter florrick &apos;s campaign manager ?
yes .
i think she was a teacher when i was there .
she must be , what , about 90 ?
she &apos;s 95 . she just had her birthday .
is that mom ?
mom !
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i i &apos;ll be right back .
well , your ice cream &apos;s going to melt .
you didn &apos;t return my calls .
i know .
that &apos;s not fair .
i didn &apos;t think it would be a good idea if we talked .
well , we &apos;re talking now because ...
peter , this is wrong .
we &apos;re fine .
no , we &apos;re not .
they have to do what they have to do .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s confidential . if you warned me about the panel ,
you &apos;d be breaking confidentiality .
you ... i ..
that &apos;s not why i was calling .
you didn &apos;t call me back . why ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to break confidentiality .
this is about you buying the house .
that &apos;s why i was calling .
what house ?
our old house- you put a down payment on it ?
no .
the sales contract has your name on it .
alicia , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
is our house for sale ?
there &apos;s another florrick .
what ? !
it &apos;s not just you and me .
there &apos;s another florrick .
jackie .
oh , my god .
jackie bought the house .
what are you talking out ?
i got to go .
wait a minute . where are you going ?
to buy a gun .
uh , could i just speak for a minute ?
now , i have made no secret of my interest
in stepping into a name partner role .
mostly because i believe the firm and our bottom lines ,
are hurt .
is this going to take long ?
only if it irritates you .
but i have decided ,
after much reflection , to support julius cain
as a name partner ,
because i feel he will best exemplify ,
um , the things ... that we want .
thank you , eli .
and , uh , i would like to applaud you for that selfless act .
oh , come on .
you flipped a coin or something .
so i would urge the equity partners who supported me
in the last vote to now support julius ...
point of information , madame chair .
what does that even mean ?
it means , they can do whatever they want .
granted .
i think one person is being overlooked
in this rush to replace me
as a name partner during my suspension .
there is one person in his room
who has the most seniority and institutional memory
to lead us into these difficult economic times .
i have the most seniority here .
no , david , you don &apos;t .
howard , do you mind standing ?
yeah , okay .
oh , dear god , you &apos;re kidding .
you can &apos;t be serious .
who is it ?
howard , would you be willing to step up
and help diane during these difficult times ?
if i get the corner office closest to the restroom .
is that a motion to replace will with howard lyman ?
yes .
do i have a second ?
second .
all in favor ?
uh , what about debate ?
it &apos;s too late . we &apos;re now turning to a vote .
it &apos;s all come down to this .
yep .
you seem distracted .
i am head somewhere after this .
i &apos;ll get right to the point then .
there are two reports i can write .
one says that there was nothing unusual about the shooting .
the police behaved admirably , the victim behaved recklessly ,
and this was all just an unfortunate accident .
in other words , a lie ?
well , let &apos;s just say , a compromise .
second report mentions the possibility of a drop gun ,
the business with the noise on the platform ,
the embarrassing detail of the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
ignoring clear evidence of a drop gun for political ends ,
and the personal involvement of your husband
in the events of the potential cover @-@ up ,
and that will not look good for him .
and you want to know which report i would vote for .
yeah , i want it to be anonymous .
i want to avoid a minority report .
very simply , the more compromised report protects your husband .
the more , shall we say , forthcoming report ,
hurts your husband .
which one do you want ?
nothing is simple , is it ?
oh , that &apos;s not true .
candy land is simple .
i &apos;m recusing myself .
any way i go on this decision , i have a conflict of interest .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
that boy pleaded with you for the truth .
his father &apos;s dead ,
and all he wanted from you was the truth .
i &apos;ll see you again , mrs. florrick .
i doubt it .
he could be president .
oh , please , stop .
what ? !
he &apos;s handsome enough . certainly tall enough .
oh , peter doesn &apos;t even know if he &apos;ll run for governor .
oh , he &apos;ll run for governor .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
he has to decide by next week .
oh , jacques , would @-@ would you just give me a second ?
sure .
hello , jackie .
alicia .
you have a moment ?
