i never stopped loving you .
aria , they &apos;re gonna market the hell out of this book .
it &apos;s gonna be huge .
oh , my god , we did it .
i lied to you earlier , aria . i did see ali .
and i &apos;m pretty sure she confessed to killing charlotte .
we don &apos;t have time to debate this .
right now , alison is safely locked up at welby
and hanna &apos;s life is on the line .
i &apos;m gonna make sure you live a long life
rotting away in here .
i know you killed charlotte .
stop ! please , you have to help me , please .
are you sure about this ?
yes , i &apos;m sure .
if someone tried to hurt you , the police ...
i have to talk to my friends before i do anything .
i understand .
you &apos;re a friend of my niece , of alison .
i never said anything about alison .
i can tell by the way that you &apos;re looking at me .
you knew my sister jessica , alison &apos;s mother
so you must be a friend of alison &apos;s .
ali never mentioned anything about her mother having a sister .
let alone a twin sister ?
what &apos;s your name ?
hanna .
families are very complicated things , hanna .
yeah , i &apos;ve noticed .
many families have secrets .
most families , really .
and sometimes , those secrets are actual people .
imagine that .
and that &apos;s who you are ?
one of those secret people ?
not anymore .
第七季第二集
here , hanna .
hanna , are you sure you don &apos;t want to go to the doctor ?
i &apos;m sure .
hanna , i think you should .
the doctors are gonna ask questions .
and then , i &apos;ll have to lie . no doctors , no questions .
hanna , i &apos;m sorry , but you have to tell us
about mary drake picking you up .
is she real ?
i mean , is she really who she says she is ?
we think so .
yeah , she was a patient at radley .
we found her file .
what ?
she &apos;s alison &apos;s aunt , charlotte &apos;s biological mother .
the dilaurentis family adopted charlotte .
so it &apos;s her .
mary drake , she &apos;s been after us all along .
someone killed her daughter
and then she shows up to get even .
yeah , we &apos;re pretty sure she didn &apos;t show up
just to get into the resort business .
she must have been chasing me when i got out .
but why wouldn &apos;t she just run me over
instead of bringing me here ?
because we gave her exactly what she wanted .
charlotte &apos;s killer ?
we &apos;re convinced it &apos;s alison .
we found evidence .
spencer , can i have something stronger than coffee in here ?
yeah .
this belongs to you .
thanks .
oh , that &apos;s mona .
well , be careful in case it isn &apos;t .
马上到那里
well , there was nobody there , just this .
&quot; couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
glad we &apos;re on the same team . a.d. &quot;
it &apos;s from lucas .
sit down . i can do that .
i can boil my own water . thanks .
can i , uh , borrow you for a minute ?
so are you gonna take lucas up on his offer ?
he &apos;s crazy .
he sees your potential .
potential for what ?
for what you could do if you were in charge .
caleb , haven &apos;t you noticed ?
none of us are in charge of anything around here .
well , we can fix that .
no one &apos;s giving up on anybody .
then what ?
suppose we get through that ...
... where does that leave us ?
back to where we started ?
well , i guess it depends on how far back we wanna go .
look , in that room at the resort
before all the lights went off
and someone pushed me down a hole , i was scared .
me too .
but you were there .
i always felt safe around you .
even when we weren &apos;t getting along , you made me feel safe .
maybe that &apos;s why what happened happened ...
... with us .
so you think we just went back
to what we used to be for a minute ?
yeah .
only for a minute .
where is spencer ?
hey , you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
uh , i just wanted to be by myself for a minute .
i think we &apos;re all feeling a little lost right now .
i &apos;m fine .
do you think ali &apos;s safe ?
at welby ?
i mean , places like that are designed to keep people
from getting out , not from getting in .
maybe we need to warn elliott .
well , what do you wanna tell him ?
that we told someone his wife
killed her own sister who &apos;s actually her cousin ?
i mean , he &apos;d lock us up .
spencer .
hey , how about i take you home ?
yeah .
okay .
em , keep an eye on hanna .
you feel it too ?
yeah , she &apos;s got that look .
the dollhouse look .
bye .
do you wanna give jordan a call ?
and tell him what ?
that i got myself a little kidnapped for a while ?
maybe you just wanna hear his voice .
it &apos;s too late to call him now . i &apos;ll do it later .
hey , aren &apos;t you tired ?
um , no , i shot past tired a long time ago .
well , we should probably get some sleep while we can .
yeah , i just have to finish this up for my mom .
turns out there &apos;s way more paperwork
when you win instead of lose .
i &apos;m really glad that hanna &apos;s safe .
we all are .
that was so dangerous . i should &apos;ve stopped her .
you know , hanna &apos;s like an aircraft carrier .
lot of firepower , but pretty difficult to maneuver .
yeah , well , i guess they call ships &quot; she &quot; for a reason , huh ?
come to bed .
i will soon .
hello .
hello ?
help me .
who is this ?
help me , emily .
ali ?
em , i need you .
ali , are you alright ?
let go .
hello .
give me the phone .
no . no .
ali ?
no , you made a mistake . i visited her the other day .
i &apos;m the one that brought her here .
mrs. rollins &apos; visiting instructions have been changed .
family only .
w @-@ why did they change ?
did something happen ?
all i can tell you is the only visitors
she &apos;s allowed are family members .
is dr. rollins here ? can you page him , please ?
dr. rollins is right over there .
elliott .
emily .
thank you .
they won &apos;t let me in to see ali .
those are my instructions .
is she alright ? has something happened ?
i &apos;ve decided alison will be better off
in isolation right now .
okay , can i just see her for a minute ?
it &apos;s not in ali &apos;s best interests or yours .
so , when can she have visitors ?
as soon as i think she can , i &apos;ll call you .
i have to go . i &apos;m sorry .
thanks .
so how is alison doing ?
i heard she was in the hospital .
i wish people would just leave her alone .
i was just asking how she &apos;s doing .
sorry .
so how are you ?
i &apos;m kinda tired .
did you get the package that i sent over ?
lucas , why are you doing this for me ?
i mean , you could be out
building some private spaceship or something .
the private spaceship market
is a little overcrowded at the moment .
did you look at the papers ?
there were a lot of them .
lot of those little &quot; sign here &quot; stickers .
why do you make it so hard for somebody
to do something nice for you ?
why do you resist it so much ?
look , lucas , i think you think i &apos;m somebody i &apos;m not .
everyone thinks i &apos;m somebody i &apos;m not .
somebody smarter ...
... braver , sharper .
but i &apos;m not .
yes , you are . that &apos;s the point .
hanna , i think you want this .
otherwise , i wouldn &apos;t have offered it .
but i do need an answer .
we need to file a business plan
or we &apos;re gonna lose the tax credit .
look , i &apos;m just saying , i &apos;m not the best person
when it comes to making decisions .
well , hanna , not making a decision ...
... that &apos;s a decision .
if you could &apos;ve heard her on the phone .
maybe she killed charlotte , maybe she didn &apos;t .
we can &apos;t just leave her in there with no one protecting her .
okay , well , did you tell elliott about the call ?
no , i didn &apos;t want him to know who she was calling .
so , where did you leave things with him ?
he said he &apos;ll call me when she improves .
but i don &apos;t think we can wait .
um , it &apos;s my work . i &apos;ll call them back .
what about mary drake ?
what about her ?
she &apos;s family , she has access , you know ?
should we try and use her ?
ask mary to take us to see ali ?
em , we think this woman might be uber a.
you wanna ask her to help ?
okay .
maybe it &apos;s better that we go in there with her
than let her go in by herself .
no , we can &apos;t take that chance .
i think we both saw this coming .
apparently , one of us saw it before the other .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , so am i.
it &apos;s just coming home and seeing my friends
and everything that ali &apos;s going through
i realize i &apos;ve got a lot of unresolved things in my life
and it wouldn &apos;t be fair to you .
i think you want me to say &quot; thank you &quot;
but i &apos;m not going to .
no , i just want you to understand .
i &apos;ve gotta work through these things .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the book or ezra .
it &apos;s all me .
it &apos;s just about you and me .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry ... i don &apos;t think you have to say that anymore .
i &apos;m ...
i got a surprise too .
it &apos;s not as big as yours , but , um ...
i &apos;m back on the book .
that &apos;s what i came here to tell you .
you &apos;re back on the book ?
yeah .
i convinced jillian that i &apos;d be able to prep
the manuscript faster than anyone else , and she agreed .
you &apos;re gonna edit the book ?
more that i &apos;ll be a kind of creative gatekeeper .
make sure everything goes well
and everybody stays reasonably happy .
do we have a problem ?
i don &apos;t know . do we ?
you worked hard for this .
i &apos;d like to see you get something you &apos;ve always wanted .
we &apos;re almost there , aren &apos;t we ?
yeah , almost .
then we &apos;ll do it .
we &apos;ll make it work .
hey , at least we can cross the finish line together .
not just first class .
first class , front row , window , the side with the door .
because she has to be the last one on the plane
and the first one off .
no , don &apos;t say you &apos;ll try , just do it .
i need my napkin .
under your drink , that &apos;s my napkin .
oh , yeah , sure .
god , don &apos;t tear it .
sorry .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you just melted a really important phone number .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .
you and your sweaty glass .
yeah .
it &apos;s okay .
see , the ink ran , but you can see
where the pen pressed into the napkin .
see ? there .
thank you .
sorry about my sweaty glass .
it &apos;s okay .
so what do they charge you for office space around here ?
i &apos;m a really good tipper .
long day at the office ? can i get you something to eat ?
suppose i &apos;m meeting someone ?
you &apos;re not .
how do you know that ?
well , you ordered a second drink .
if you were meeting someone
you would &apos;ve nursed your first drink .
have you been counting my drinks ?
i notice details .
interesting how your sweaty glass
just happened to land on my phone number , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that is the most interesting thing
that &apos;s happened to me all night .
we just wanna see her .
all we need is five minutes .
if you really wanna help
you &apos;ll give alison time and space to heal .
that &apos;s what she needs
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to make sure she gets .
i &apos;m sorry if you can &apos;t understand that .
i know you &apos;re her friends
but i am her husband and her doctor .
maybe that &apos;s not the best combination .
meaning what ?
meaning maybe we &apos;re not the only ones
who need a little objectivity .
well , maybe i &apos;m not the most objective person .
perhaps that &apos;s because i &apos;ve spent the best part
of five years taking care of ali and charlotte .
i lack the clarity you have , being gone so long .
alright , this isn &apos;t about who cares about alison the most .
we all wanna see her get better .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do .
and , yes , i have consulted other doctors
and i &apos;ve spoken to jason .
you have ?
yes .
he approves of her treatment .
what about mary drake ?
i won &apos;t let mary drake visit .
i &apos;m concerned about ali &apos;s reaction
to someone who looks so much like her mother .
but that &apos;s ali &apos;s aunt ...
i &apos;m going to do what &apos;s best .
excuse me .
yeah .
is that the kind of diplomacy you learned in washington ?
i &apos;m sorry , aria ,
i have a very low tolerance for condescension .
eyes on the prize , spencer .
we want something from him .
yeah , and i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to get it .
which means that alison stays on one side of the wall
and we &apos;re on the other side .
&quot; she &apos;s mine now . no take backs .
no do @-@ overs . a.d. &quot;
she &apos;s mine now ?
does that mean that a.d. is already in welby ?
what &apos;s the meaning of this ?
it &apos;s a hostile takeover .
of what ?
of you .
what makes you think it has to be hostile ?
well , i haven &apos;t exactly been the model fiancee lately
so i thought i &apos;ll put a little more effort into it .
you know , that &apos;s not supposed to be a job .
i think the idea is you &apos;re supposed to have fun .
i remember fun .
do you ?
faintly .
you know , sometimes you turn into the most serious person
i &apos;ve ever known .
okay , i didn &apos;t come here to be insulted .
not all the time . just lately .
since you &apos;ve been spending time in rosewood .
yeah , well , it can have that effect on you .
then why do you keep going back there ?
do you know what i wanna do ?
what do you wanna do ?
do you remember that bar off columbus where we first met ?
yes , i do .
well , i wanna go back there
and buy you a drink .
and i wanna go back there and flirt with you
and start all over again .
is that something that might interest you ?
elliott &apos;s not gonna help us . we have to do something .
okay , something does not include making a deal with the devil .
besides , you heard him , mary cannot get in there
anymore than we can .
okay , but what if we did it together ?
if we used mary drake to get us in .
no , emily , it &apos;s not happening .
hey , look , i &apos;m not saying that we let her in the club .
i &apos;m not even saying that we should trust her .
but we need a way to ali and right now
mary drake is the closest thing to a key that we &apos;ve got .
we don &apos;t know anything about her .
you know more about her than anybody else .
you were in there , spencer .
in radley , before the designer cocktails and the valet parking .
you were locked in there .
you know how that feels .
and you know what that can do to a person .
rollins talked to jason ?
that &apos;s what he said .
according to toby , that &apos;s something
that nobody else has managed to do .
are the police looking for jason ?
toby is .
he needs someone to confirm mary drake &apos;s story .
confirmation other than her face ?
people don &apos;t seem to remember ali &apos;s mother having a sister .
when do you meet with liam ?
4 o &apos;clock .
can we make this work with him ?
of course , we can make it work . i think .
at least long enough to finish the book .
i was in such a rush to get it over with
that i broke up with him before he told me
that he was back on the book .
i really complicated the situation .
all due respect , things have been complicated
for quite some time .
this book means as much to liam as it does to us
and that &apos;s why he wants to work on it .
yeah , it might mean as much to him
but it does not mean the same things .
i promise i will make this work .
and there &apos;s a problem with his backstory .
i just noticed it this last time through .
what @-@ what sort of problem ?
the predatory nature of his actions .
you think he comes across as predatory ?
i understand the impulse , the lolita myth .
not the nabokov original but the whole older man
小说 《 洛丽塔 》 的作者
inappropriately young girl idea
that &apos;s been trashed by lesser writers .
well , we can &apos;t all be nabokov .
some of us can &apos;t even manage nicholas sparks .
well , at least sparks understands what a reader
can tolerate and what makes their skin crawl .
are we looking at the same pages here ?
because they aren &apos;t that far apart in age
so i &apos;m having a little trouble seeing what you &apos;re seeing here .
that &apos;s because he &apos;s your hero .
you &apos;re invested in justifying his actions .
you &apos;re too close to see him as he really is .
listen , i &apos;m just being frank here .
if @-@ if i can &apos;t be frank , i can &apos;t help you .
we all want the best book .
exactly .
and right now , there &apos;s this friction
between your chapters and aria &apos;s .
friction ?
look ,
neither one of us want aria to look foolish , right ?
like she let herself get talked into something
that she didn &apos;t want .
you mean aria &apos;s character .
yeah , her character .
i &apos;m here to protect this book .
and that means protecting the authors . both of them .
protecting from what ?
a loss of perspective . poor judgment .
avoidable bad choices .
that &apos;s a big responsibility .
and i take it very seriously .
yes .
i can see that .
i @-@ i just , i understand that i have commitments
but i have commitments here too .
yes , and you agreed .
i will get a hard date as soon as i can .
thank you . bye .
hello , spencer .
miss drake .
i saw you in here , and i thought i &apos;d ask about your friend .
about hanna . how is she ?
uh , she &apos;s , she &apos;s alright .
has she told you any more about what happened to her ?
no . no , not much .
i have to tell you , i don &apos;t feel
especially good about the other night .
what about it ?
letting hanna talk me into taking her to your house
instead of the police or the hospital .
so why did you ?
she insisted .
yes but you were the one who was driving the car .
you could have taken her to the police .
you could have taken her to the doctor .
you could have taken her anywhere ,
but you didn &apos;t . why ?
frankly , spencer , my experiences with hospitals
and the police haven &apos;t always been the best .
i &apos;m sorry , what do you mean ?
i told you that my sister and i had issues .
that &apos;s true , but not really honest .
one of the most distressing things about alison
being where she is right now is that
i have had similar experiences .
i spent time , considerable time
in radley when it was a sanitarium .
may i ask you why ?
why you were at radley ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you this because i want you to understand
why i &apos;m so worried about alison .
we were 14 , my sister and i. jessica was babysitting .
she called me to complain that the baby wouldn &apos;t stop crying .
it was the carver baby , teddy .
he was ten months old , and he had a cold
and he must have been miserable .
she begged me to come and help her .
i didn &apos;t want to go , but i did .
and when i got there , the baby was upstairs finally asleep .
jessica said she had given him a bath
and he had fallen right off .
then she asked me to stay with teddy
so she could meet up with matt brooks .
jessica left .
and when the carvers came home , i told them that
jessica had called me because she had a headache .
mrs. carver went upstairs .
mr. carver was giving me jessica &apos;s money .
mrs. carver started to scream .
she screamed like she was on fire .
teddy was dead .
when they found jessica , she said
well , the baby had been fine when she left .
but you told them ...
they believed jessica .
everybody always believed jessica .
she was the warm one .
and that was why your parents put you in radley .
it was that or prison .
they thought i &apos;d be safer .
at least that &apos;s what they told me .
are you sure ?
liam can be really passionate about writing .
what i got wasn &apos;t criticism . it was anger .
anger at what ?
at me .
and i promised to keep my side clean
but if every note session is gonna be a ten @-@ round bout
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna be left of this book
or of any of us .
i don &apos;t understand .
aria , what does liam
really know about you and me ?
well , this is the address .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s gone .
no , it can &apos;t be gone .
oh , we haven &apos;t been here in a long time .
no , it cannot be gone .
i mean , they @-@ they can &apos;t just take it away like that .
you can &apos;t just pull out a building
like it was a bad tooth or something .
it &apos;s new york city , hanna .
they tear things down as quickly as they put them up .
well , this was important .
okay , i needed this to be here right where i left it .
i was counting on it .
i mean , jordan , this is where we first met .
and now we don &apos;t have a beginning anymore
because they tore it down .
who do you people think you are ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
tell me and i &apos;ll fix it .
i was gonna make it perfect this time .
you know , everybody gets what they want .
god , i had it all figured out and now it &apos;s ruined .
it &apos;s gone , and it &apos;ll never work now .
w @-@ we &apos;ll just go someplace else .
they &apos;ll just tear that down too . don &apos;t you get it ?
i &apos;m a one @-@ woman demolition derby .
okay , i can &apos;t do this to you .
what do you want ?
hanna , i would move heaven and earth for you ?
you know that , don &apos;t you ?
yes ... i do
and i am so sorry .
hanna , come on . this can &apos;t be it .
miss drake ?
emily fields .
i was at spencer &apos;s when you dropped off hanna .
emily . yes .
are you staying here now ?
no , i was just ...
... thinking about this place today
and wondering what it looked like now .
do you wanna sit down ?
yes , i think i would .
i saw they kept the big gates out in front .
yeah , they did .
at night , boys from town used to rattle sticks on the bars .
somebody would dare them to go to the nut house after midnight .
i thought it was pretty frightening during the day .
it was .
but sometimes you find tenderness
in the last place you &apos;d expect .
and that &apos;s really all any of us needs to survive
is a little tenderness at the right moment .
i went to visit ali this morning .
how is she ?
they wouldn &apos;t let me in to see her .
who wouldn &apos;t let you in ?
elliot or dr. rollins .
he doesn &apos;t want me to see her either .
but you @-@ you &apos;ve been talking to him about her , right ?
over the phone . once .
are you satisfied with how he &apos;s been taking care of her ?
oh , yes .
i suppose .
overall . i mean , he &apos;s very professional .
yeah .
but it does take some getting used to him
being her new husband and her doctor .
i &apos;m the one that took ali to welby
and i can &apos;t help but wonder if i did the right thing .
you wanted to help .
yeah , but i don &apos;t know if i did .
you &apos;re ali &apos;s aunt .
maybe if you talk to somebody at the sanitarium ...
i don &apos;t know , emily .
that would be like challenging dr. rollins .
yeah , i understand .
perhaps you and i can go to the sanitarium together .
look , i feel bad about how we left things today .
if we don &apos;t work on this project together , it &apos;ll be another one .
can i borrow your pen ?
my pen ?
to sign these papers , partner .
you &apos;re right . i want this .
and right now , i want this more than anything else .
you said that we could work together .
that we could all be adults .
i meant it when i said it .
then what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
reading his pages again and then sitting there
listening to him while he was talking ...
he has a way with words .
i used to admire that .
you don &apos;t anymore ?
no , now i am suspicious .
of what ?
it was a lot of unconnected things
that i didn &apos;t wanna connect and then they clicked
together on their own .
your history , what you &apos;ve been writing
how you &apos;ve been writing it .
what changes in a room when you guys are alone together
and then somebody else walks in ?
okay , and what do all these connections mean ?
i think you were seduced by your english teacher
when you were in high school .
it &apos;s not how it happened .
i just gave you a great opening to lie one more time
and you didn &apos;t take it .
look , there is no way that i can possibly explain this to you .
then try by telling me how you &apos;d explain it to yourself .
okay , i used to think what if there was a button
that i could push and all of the things
that have complicated my life would just unhappen ?
i would push it , and all of the people
that shouldn &apos;t have died would still be alive .
i wouldn &apos;t have hurt anyone or disappointed them
and no one would have hurt me or lied to me
and this whole mess would just be cleaned up .
but if i push that button , i would be gone too .
i am me because of what has happened
what i &apos;ve done and because of who i love .
i like that person .
that me .
mess and all .
emily ?
you were supposed to wake me up .
it took me longer to get here than i thought it would .
i can &apos;t move .
i think something &apos;s wrong with me .
you &apos;re in the hospital .
we &apos;re gonna miss our flight .
we &apos;ll take the next one .
ali , you called me last night .
did i ?
yeah .
and you sounded scared .
like you wanted help .
this is a scary place .
there &apos;s this lady that cries all night .
am i in radley ?
no . no .
well , that &apos;s good .
i was worried for a minute .
mommy ?
why did you leave me ?
i woke up , and there was dirt all over me
and you wouldn &apos;t help .
why did you leave me in the ground ?
it &apos;s so cold .
alison .
you were wrong about elliot .
he &apos;s not like what you said at all .
what about elliot ?
i didn &apos;t authorize this .
uh , this lady is a relative ...
no visitors without my permission .
out . everyone . right now .
emily , no , don &apos;t go .
emily , no !
no !
no !
what happened to her ?
she wasn &apos;t like that when she came here .
miss drake , i &apos;d like a word with you .
no one &apos;s to come in .
you &apos;re not supposed to be here .
i &apos;ve been calling you for two days .
your being here is not part of the plan .
well , neither is what you &apos;re doing to that girl .
you &apos;ve gone too far .
you got what you wanted .
the money is yours .
not yet it isn &apos;t .
then stop wasting my time .
listen to me .
don &apos;t .
hello .
hey .
dad &apos;s private stock .
