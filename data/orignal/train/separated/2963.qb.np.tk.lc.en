well , unless it &apos;s the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt ..
i &apos;m gonna say , &quot; congratulations . &quot;
i &apos;m so excited . apparently , i beat out hundreds of other applicants ..
including five guys i went to graduate school with .
not that i &apos;m keeping score , or anything . five .
wow , that &apos;s great .
yeah .
so tell me about the grant .
well , okay , it &apos;s for $ 25,000 .
and if i get it , i &apos;ll be able to complete my field research .
and there will be an article about me in the paleontology review .
it &apos;ll be the first time my name is in there ..
without people raising serious questions about my work .
are you talking about the dewer grant ?
yeah . why ?
benjamin hobart is administering that grant .
your ex @-@ boyfriend ?
yeah .
so your ex @-@ boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant ?
wow , your new boyfriend is screwed .
no . no , we ended on great terms .
if anything , i think this could help you . you know what ?
why don &apos;t we all go out to dinner , and i can introduce you .
if you think it &apos;d help .
yeah , absolutely . i &apos;ll call him .
now , is there anything i could do to butter him up ?
anything he really likes ?
he does have a pretty serious latex fetish .
we &apos;ll see how dinner goes .
hey .
hey , you want to go see a movie ?
i told you i had to spend all day clearing out stuff so mike could move in .
oh , right .
yeah .
now that i &apos;m here , i might as well help with the cleaning and organizing .
i just happen to have my label maker .
oh , it &apos;s so hard to get rid of stuff .
did you and chandler make compromises when you moved in together ?
chandler did .
what does he want you to give up ?
a bunch of stuff .
and the worst one , he wants me to get rid of gladys .
who &apos;s gladys ?
what a tragic loss .
yeah , i really hate to give her up . oh , i know . oh , you should take her .
i don &apos;t know .
what , you don &apos;t like her ?
of course i do . what &apos;s not to like ?
i &apos;d take her in a minute .
but i think that you &apos;re giving up too easy .
honey , i think that you need to fight for her .
really , you think ?
absolutely .
you say to him , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , mike , i can &apos;t live without her .
she means too much to me . &quot;
okay , i &apos;ll fight for her . okay .
oh , wait . i just realized , if i do that , that means you don &apos;t get her .
damn it , i did not think this through .
emma , mom &apos;s got a snack for you .
you know , every now and then , she might like some barbecue potato chips .
hey , guys .
hey .
hi .
hey , baby .
oh , any word on casting yet ?
i told you , you &apos;re not right for the part .
what do you mean ?
rach , don &apos;t i seem like a professor you &apos;d buy some kind of e @-@ crap from ?
i &apos;m sorry , this sounds like something i &apos;m never gonna be interested in .
look , come on , please ? it &apos;s not like i &apos;m asking you for some crazy favor .
this is what i do for a living . i am a professional actor .
man , i &apos;m two hours late for work .
here &apos;s my reel . it &apos;s got all the commercials that i &apos;ve been in .
joe ..
just watch it .
if you don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t pass it on to your bosses .
fine .
thank you .
work , joe .
damn it .
what am i gonna do now ?
just pass the tape along .
he &apos;s not right for the part .
if i suggest him , my bosses will think i &apos;m an idiot .
and that &apos;s something they should learn on their own .
just tell joey that you watched the tape ..
and you liked it , but your bosses didn &apos;t .
then you &apos;re the good guy , and they &apos;re the bad guy .
that &apos;s good . i liked it , they didn &apos;t .
joey , for god &apos;s sake , go to work .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m about to meet benjamin hobart .
i &apos;ve always thought of him as someone i &apos;d invite ..
to my fantasy dinner party .
do you think there &apos;s any chance he &apos;ll bring christie brinkley or c @-@ 3po ?
sorry , it looks like it &apos;s just him .
charlie . ( gregory kinnear )
my god , you look absolutely stunning .
well , i am having a good hair day .
it &apos;s so good to see you .
oh , you too .
i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;m sorry . ross geller , benjamin hobart .
it &apos;s an honor to meet you . i can &apos;t tell you how long ..
i &apos;ve been an admirer of your work . i mean , that nobel prize .
i mean , i have to tell you that you &apos;re one of the reasons i got into the field .
well , likewise .
not likewise . i &apos;d never heard of you until this morning .
but it &apos;s nice to be nice .
shall we ?
yeah . thank you .
i can &apos;t believe that you chose this restaurant .
do you remember the night ?
oh , my god . i completely forgot .
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe they let us back in this place .
you weren &apos;t there .
no , but , you know , it &apos;s just a funny image .
you know , the two of you in this restaurant with the ..
ross , why don &apos;t you tell benji about your proposal while i go to the ladies &apos; room .
so tell me about it .
okay . well , i would like to do a dig in the painted desert .
there are still several areas that haven &apos;t been fully excavated .
break up with charlie .
what ?
what ?
did you just say , &quot; break up with charlie &quot; ?
well , yes and no . yes , i did say it . and no , i didn &apos;t not say it .
kind of inappropriate , don &apos;t you think ?
listen , i &apos;m sorry .
i just haven &apos;t seen her for so long , all these feelings are rushing back .
i &apos;m starting to realize how much i &apos;ve missed her .
and i &apos;m gonna need you to break up with her .
are you serious ?
if you say , yes , then i &apos;m serious .
if you say , no , then i &apos;m joking .
no .
joking it is .
hi , sorry i &apos;m late .
hey , how &apos;d it go with mike ?
is he gonna let you keep the painting ?
no , he really hates it .
but he &apos;s gonna let me keep my box of human hair .
so you gotta pick your battles . but the good news is , gladys is yours .
wow , what &apos;s the bad news ?
who &apos;s gladys ?
oh , she &apos;s that work of art i made .
you know , with the woman coming out of the frame .
and monica gets to keep her ?
in her house ? i am so jealous .
i didn &apos;t know you wanted her too .
well , i mean , sure , of course .
but you already gave that to monica , so ..
you know , i would give her up for you .
no , i couldn &apos;t let you do that .
no , but i want to .
but i don &apos;t want you to .
but i insist .
but i insist harder .
girls . girls . stop . okay , we &apos;ll flip a coin .
heads , she &apos;s rachel &apos;s . tails , she &apos;s monica &apos;s .
tails . monica , she &apos;s yours .
no , that landed in your food .
no , no , that &apos;s okay . you won fair and square . i &apos;m so sad .
then the little red squirrel took all of his acorns ..
and put them in his little satchel and set off for ..
okay . someone &apos;s getting a little fussy . i think it &apos;s time for bed .
where &apos;s the little red squirrel going ?
hey , joe ?
oh , that &apos;s so sweet .
what &apos;s up ?
bad news .
i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren &apos;t interested .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
but you watched the tape ?
yeah , i liked it .
but my bosses didn &apos;t go for it . stupid sons of bitches .
you didn &apos;t watch the tape .
what ? of course i did .
look , it &apos;s one thing not to cast me , but to lie to me ?
i &apos;m not lying to you . i watched it .
you lied again .
i watched it .
keep going , pinocchio .
i did .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m telling you , i watched the tape .
did you watch the tape ?
no .
hi . look , i realize only one of us can get this grant .
and i just wanted to wish both of you the best of luck .
are you crossing your fingers ?
what , this ? no . this .. that &apos;s just the result of a childhood injury .
i &apos;m cured !
good morning , everybody .
if you go ahead and take your seats we can get started .
actually , dr. hobart , can i have a word with you ?
and you are ?
ross .
i know . i &apos;m kidding .
listen , i just want to say , last night ..
dinner was a little awkward .
i just wanna make sure we &apos;re okay .
oh , yeah . absolutely .
you didn &apos;t tell charlie what i said , did you ?
oh , no . of course not .
well , thank you . i want you to know , i respect your decision not to give her up .
it was the biggest mistake i ever made in my whole life .
well , that and tattooing her name on my shoulder ..
last night stupidly .
seriously ?
my nobel prize was not for moving on .
so no hard feelings ?
none at all . good luck today .
thank you .
okay .
all right . the selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists .
the ultimate decision will be based on the answers you give to the questions i ask .
we &apos;re gonna go ahead and start with dr. li .
you claim the field is too reliant on the linnaean taxonomic system .
how do you propose to correct this problem ?
well , i believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence .
i plan to begin there .
interesting .
i guess .
dr. biely , your proposal includes some fieldwork . where might that take place ?
primarily in the pierre shale region of south dakota .
certainly . very well . and dr. geller , when is my birthday ?
what ? i ..
care to venture a guess ?
may 12 ?
that &apos;s not even kind of close .
dr. li , how many graduate students will you need ?
half a dozen .
i see . and dr. biely ?
three for excavation , and two for analysis .
certainly . dr. geller , which 1965 shirelles hit ..
was later covered by a popular british invasion band ?
what ? i need six graduate students .
no , i &apos;m sorry . we were looking for &quot; baby it &apos;s you . &quot;
&quot; baby it &apos;s you . &quot;
what ? wait just a minute .
none of my questions have anything to do with paleontology .
you &apos;re right , i apologize . scratch the last question .
spell &quot; boscodictiasaur . &quot;
i &apos;ve never heard of a &quot; boscodictiasaur . &quot;
yeah , i just made it up . spell it .
okay . b @-@ o .. - no , it starts with a silent m.
oh , come on !
i can &apos;t believe joey . i hate being called a liar .
but you are a liar .
what did i just say ?
are you still here ?
yes .
and i &apos;m not just hurt , i &apos;m insulted . when i tell somebody i did something ..
okay , hold on , let me just stop you right there , okay ? first , you lied . right ?
then you lied about lying , okay ?
then you lied about lying about lying , okay ?
so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about lying ..
stop lying .
why are you so sure i didn &apos;t watch this tape ?
you wanna know why ? you wanna know why ?
well , this is going well .
here &apos;s how i know you didn &apos;t watch .
if you had seen what was on this tape , believe me , you &apos;d have some comments .
all right , remember , i got paid a lot of money for this ..
and it only aired in japan .
ichiban .
ichiban , lipstick for men .
ichiban , lipstick for men .
and that &apos;s how i know you didn &apos;t watch the tape .
he really is a chameleon .
well , gladys , say hello to your new home .
oh , my .
wow .
oh , she is so nice and big .
oh , monica , where are you going to display gladys , oh , so proudly ?
i haven &apos;t really settled on a spot yet .
how about right above the tv ?
that way , it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door .
yeah , yeah , and you can get rid of that french poster .
i like that poster .
really ?
it doesn &apos;t have anything coming out of it .
or maybe there &apos;s someplace for her in your bedroom ?
there &apos;s nothing above your bed .
are you still here ?
stupid nobel prize winner .
i &apos;m sorry
oh , hi . hello .
have you come to ask me some more paleontology @-@ related questions ?
your grandmother &apos;s nickname , perhaps ? ann @-@ margret &apos;s pant size ?
i &apos;ve come here to apologize . i think i may have let my feelings ..
for charlie interfere with the interview process .
no . stop .
anyway , i decided to offer you the grant .
really ?
there is just one small stipulation .
i have to break up with charlie ?
hey , you got one right .
you &apos;re crazy .
crazy or romantic ?
crazy .
or ?
get out !
oh , my god .
what ?
joey , what is this thing doing here ?
i got her from monica . she sold it to me for a very reasonable price .
joey , we &apos;re not keeping this .
but it &apos;s an original buffay .
all right , fine . you can keep it .
as long as you don &apos;t mind that she &apos;s haunted .
hey , what ? what ?
well , legend has it , joey , that she comes alive when you &apos;re asleep .
she climbs out of the frame ..
and then drags her half @-@ a @-@ body across the floor ..
just looking for legs to steal .
and then with her one good hand ..
she slowly reaches up ..
and turns your doorknob .
get that legless witch out of here !
hey , i sold that to joey .
yeah , well , i told him it &apos;s haunted .
two can play at this game .
too late . you can &apos;t give it back .
oh , yes , i can .
no , you can &apos;t , she &apos;s yours .
she &apos;s yours .
she &apos;s yours .
she &apos;s yours .
hey .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
you guys , you don &apos;t have to fight over her anymore .
whoever doesn &apos;t get gladys , gets glynnis .
i want gladys .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
konichiwa , joey sang
no , no . you don &apos;t get to do that .
i know . look , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t give them your tape .
and i promise next time to submit you , whether i think you &apos;re right or not .
that &apos;s not the point , chandler . the point is that you lied .
i know . you &apos;re right . what &apos;s it gonna take for you to forgive me ?
oh , my god .
excellent .
now what do you say ?
lying is wrong .
and ? and ?
i &apos;m a pretty little girl .
i knew it .
your ex @-@ boyfriend is insane .
he is a character .
no , no , no .
charles nelson reilly is a character .
who ?
charles nelson reilly .
the ghost and mrs. muir ? match game ?
were you never sick as a child ?
whatever . did you get the grant ?
no . and you wanna know why ?
because your ex @-@ boyfriend is still in love with you .
what ?
yeah .
he refused me because i wouldn &apos;t give you up .
benji isn &apos;t in love with me . i mean , he broke up with me .
and besides , he &apos;s a very ethical man .
really ?
is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review :
&quot; who was the voice of underdog ? &quot;
i &apos;m sure he was just joking .
if you don &apos;t believe me , let &apos;s go talk to him .
i &apos;m telling you , he didn &apos;t ask me one paleontological question .
seriously ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . no , he did ask me one :
&quot; how do you spell boscodictiasaur ? &quot;
well , if it &apos;s like the lake mbosco in congo , then m @-@ b @-@ o ..
damn it .
dr. geller . charlie , what are you doing here ?
i want you to tell her everything .
about the deal you tried to make with me , about the crazy questions you ..
wally cox . that &apos;s the voice of underdog .
like i tried to tell you in the interview ..
this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia .
no , don &apos;t do that . i want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth .
benji ?
all right . it &apos;s true . i behaved horribly , but it &apos;s only because i still love you .
and i would do anything to have you back in my life .
too little , too late , benji .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i never should &apos;ve broken up with you .
i think about you all the time . do you ever still think about me ?
no .
yes .
what ?
i don &apos;t know what to say , benji . this is all so ..
romantic .
or ?
i know i may be way out of bounds here ..
but is there any chance you would take me back ?
maybe .
sweetie , this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable .
oh , god . i am so sorry , but ..
i mean , there &apos;s so much history between us , you know ?
i &apos;m sorry too .
i love you .
i love you too .
okay , that &apos;s it , we are seeing other people .
gladys ?
for the third time this week . man , this does not get old .
