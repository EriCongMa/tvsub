i worked on it this morning .
you @-@ you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
i don &apos;t ... it &apos;s not ...
&quot; nick &apos;s life plan &quot; ?
what is that ? !
i &apos;m just trying to keep you on track , nick .
look , we &apos;ve always done everything together ,
and i &apos;m just worried that we &apos;re gonna drift apart .
you know , i &apos;m gonna get married and have kids ,
and you &apos;re gonna be wandering around the grocery store ,
holding a bottle of scotch and an ear of corn .
okay , you know what ?
you know what i have to say to you , schmidt ? boundaries .
you know , you and me .
boundaries .
all right , let &apos;s do this .

oh , my god , my boobs are gonna get huge !
unbelievable !
they &apos;re gonna be like , &quot; get out of my way .
here come my boobs . &quot;
yankees suck ! yankees suck ! yankees suck !
it really means a lot to me , man
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t do it myself .
yeah , you know what i think it was ?
one time , i got stung in the penis
five different times by five different bees
five days in a row .
what were you doing
that your naked penis was exposed to bumblebees ?
why is he here ?
you know , even though i don &apos;t approve of this ,
i would never , ever leave you in your time of need .
schmidt , i don &apos;t want you here .
i told him i didn &apos;t want him here .
i can &apos;t be any more clear on that .
i botched it !
botched it good ! three strikes , and you &apos;re out !
how do you botch it ?
you do not have my blessing .
i don &apos;t need your blessing .
i don &apos;t want it . i don &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t even want you here .
mr. miller , we &apos;re ready for you .
thank you so much .
here i go .
nicky , give &apos; em hell , huh ?
yeah .

you got it .
go get &apos; em , nicky .
we believe in you .
come on , make a smart one .
here we go !
yeah !
hey , schmidt , can i have a ...
so you do need my blessing !
i don &apos;t need you ! just please come back in here with me .
thank you .
never seen two guys so close like that , you know .
my dad and his ...
and his friend joe were close like that .
oh , yeah ?
mm @-@ hmm .
well , you got in my head .
you got in my head .
why &apos;d you have to tell me about the plan , schmidt ?
now i need to know what happens .
why am i not supposed to have a baby this way ?
as i saw it , your first child was to be born
between you and a small italian woman .
like a maria ?
yes , like a maria .
okay .
she makes meatballs and soup ,
and does laundry in a wooden bucket .
yeah , she does .
you guys have a child .
it &apos;s a boy . i &apos;m incredibly involved .
i give him the other half of a walkie @-@ talkie just in case
he ever has a question in the middle of the night .
yes , i &apos;m here .
he hides his broccoli in a planter during dinner .
i wink . i look the other way .
you mean e @-@ broccoli .
what ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s the future .
how far in the future are you planning on having a child ?
well , if we &apos;re talking about me meeting a woman ,
falling in love and having a kid ?
a very , very , very , very long time .
so many &quot; verys . &quot;
and let &apos;s face the facts .
my love life is a disaster .
schmidt , this might be my only chance of having a kid .
don &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m saying it .
and if i can &apos;t have a kid with a woman ,
then maybe i &apos;ll have one with my cousin .
horrifying wording
for what actually is , well , a beautiful sentiment .
i @-@ i want to do this .
i want to experience this .
you know , and i know i won &apos;t be able to raise him ,
and ... and that &apos;s disappointing , but ...
i &apos;ll still see the little guy at parties and such .
say hi . he &apos;ll say hi .
give him some fireworks to pop off , or ...
or e @-@ fireworks .
man , i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m getting excited just thinking about this .
look , it &apos;s not how i originally planned it ,
but it &apos;s still another nick miller in the world ,
and i &apos;ll take that any way i can get it .
you have my blessing .
well , it &apos;s embarrassing to admit , but ...
thanks , man , i kind of needed it .
yeah , absolutely .
you should get out of here , man . i &apos;m gonna go masturbate .
okay .
we ...
really got after it there .
i am so happy i could help .
like , i don &apos;t want to be ...
greedy about it , &apos; cause i know i &apos;ve already put on
the most perfect dress once today , and i should wait ...
you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
i really want to put it on again .
you should put it on again .
i know !
okay , i &apos;m going to go try it on .
okay , try it on again .
okay .
oh , no !
oh , no .
what did we do ?
what is this ?
oh , my god !
how drunk were we ?
no .
no . okay .
you know what , no , no , no , no .
this is , you know what , this is , this is good .
everything &apos;s all right .
i mean , look , you got mirrors .
you know , no one &apos;s ever done that before .
i like it , you know . i like the ...
again , i can &apos;t talk enough about the mirrors .
why is there a spot for batteries ?
so the glass can light up .
we were really excited about that feature .
yeah . you look like a prostitute for wizards .
i look like a bullfighter in space .
i cannot get married in this dress .
okay , so what do you need me to do ?
nothing . i don &apos;t need your help .
okay . &apos; cause i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m gonna do it by myself .
well ... you washed ?
yeah , well , no , i ...
yeah , of course i washed .
hey , why the ...
why the long faces ?
shouldn &apos;t we be celebrating here , guys ?
listen , we , uh , we talked to the doctor and , uh ,
turns out we can &apos;t afford the procedure .
are you kidding me ?
so i just masturbated for nothing ?
you @-@ you guys flew across the country .
you didn &apos;t think about any of this beforehand ?
we did little to no research .
but we still want to have a family , you know .
we already fell in love with the little bastard .
anyway , there is one other option
we could explore .
what is it ? anything .
nick ...
i want you to have sex with my wife .
what ?
yeah , we don &apos;t just
need your reindeer , we need santa .
what ?
yeah , come down the chimney .
what ?
feet first .
white christmas .
bring a sackful of gifts .
this is not ... i can &apos;t do this .
this might be your only chance to have a kid .
yeah , but then i have to have sex with my cousin .
i don &apos;t want to have ... i don &apos;t want to have sex with my cousin .
it &apos;s not your cousin . it &apos;s your cousin &apos;s wife .
that &apos;s like letting a dog drink water out of your mouth .
you know , it &apos;s not great , but it &apos;s legal .
the point i &apos;m trying to make is ,
is i think i &apos;d like another nick miller in the world .
all right .
can you imagine ?
come on , man , what do you say ?
i think the best thing to do here
is to just look at this like a medical procedure .
why is this guy in this conversation here ?
bobby , it &apos;s a losing battle . just move past it .
and , carol , look , i don &apos;t want this to feel ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , romantic .
i don &apos;t want you getting confused .
there &apos;s a zero percent chance of that happening .
yeah .
if you &apos;re suggesting that i can &apos;t be romantic ,
then you &apos;re out of your mind .
yeah , excuse me ,
nick is very romantic , okay ?
he does romantic things for me all the time .
schmidt , what are you talking about ?
just the other week , you were very romantic to me .
when i fell down in the parking lot and you picked me up ?
well just more like ...
get up , dude !
how was that romantic ? !
it was beautiful and it was kind .
you know , romance doesn &apos;t always have to be sexual ,
you idiot .
you &apos;re the idiot !
don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
honestly , you want to do this right now ?
give me one shot at that big head ,
i &apos;m gonna knock you out .
dominated you physically . admit it .
yeah , defense .
can we put something over the windows ?
i want it to be pitch black in here , so i can &apos;t see ...
i don &apos;t like the way you look at my body
when you say that , carol .
well ...
okay , we got to keep it positive .
i agree .
i think what nick is trying to say
is that he &apos;d like to be completely naked .
where are you getting this from ? !
objection , your honor ! strongly !
&apos;cause i will be wearing clothes !
overruled . yeah .
overruled .
yeah , stand down .
but i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll tell ya ,
i &apos;m not wearing a condom ! end of discussion .
guys ...
such a clearly great joke .
because obviously i can &apos;t wear , you know ...
we got to loosen the vibe a little .
can we do something about this smell ?
oh , yeah .
it is a little rank , yeah .
there is an odor .
yeah .
well , i lost a glass of milk .
you lost a glass of milk ? was it full ?
yeah , it was to the top .
i could barely carry it .
oh , that &apos;s outrageous !
oh , god .
now , if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d just like to bring things down for a second here .
bob , carol , um , i originally bought this for nick ,
but since he may never have someone to give it to ,
i &apos;d like for you guys to have it .
no , dude , no .
we &apos;re pats fan . we hate the bears .
you don &apos;t like the onesie ?
pats are number onesie .
where did we land on me being in the room ?
get out , schmidt !
get the hell out of here !
look , i @-@ i know that you have a &quot; no return &quot; policy ,
but you have to take this dress back , okay ?
i look like a rich person in the hunger games .
yeah , i know .
i was gonna stop you from buying it ,
but i didn &apos;t , so we &apos;re done here .
wrong !
see , you may be done with her ,
but you &apos;re not done with the law .
winston bishop , lapd .
you &apos;re a cop ? the guy who was spinning around
singing patti labelle songs yesterday ?
* i tidied up my point of view *
* i got a new attitude *
and you must be the one who was serving champagne
without a liquor license .
we don &apos;t charge for it .
it &apos;s legal .
uh , not if it &apos;s being served to a @-@ a minor .
yeah . oh , that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m 17 years old . i &apos;m a kid .
you &apos;re a 17 @-@ year @-@ old police officer ?
i &apos;m a cop prodigy .
you see , my school is the streets .
but my other school is school .
&apos;cause- &apos; cause i go to school .
like a school @-@ school , for learning .
you are so stupid .
no return policy
is more important than the love
that brings us here today , so ...
this means a lot to her , so please help her out .
well , that didn &apos;t work .
look , cece , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m no good at this .
i &apos;m no help . i &apos;m just gonna ...
i &apos;m just gonna take a backseat to the wedding .
no . look ...
what you did in there made me realize how much you ...
really care about me .
i know that you &apos;re already one of schmidt &apos;s groomsmen ,
um , but i was hoping you would maybe also consider
being one of my bridesmaids .
you want me to be a bridesmaid ?
if you don &apos;t want to , i ...
do you know who you &apos;re talking to ?
yes ?
you &apos;re talking to winnie the bish !
yeah .
i would love to be your bridesmaid !
yes ?
yes !
yes ?
yes !
girl , you are under arrest for taking my breath away !
what &apos;s with this parachute top ?
it &apos;s good for movement , hard to stain .
i thought it was appropriate .
okay . i don &apos;t know what you think
we &apos;re about to do , but i &apos;m keeping this very simple .
i want to keep it simple .
great .
should we ... should we just make love now , then ?
&quot; make love &quot; ?
what , are we riding horses around on a beach topless ?
no , thank you .
just tip me over and pour me out !
tip you over and pour you out ?
yeah . it &apos;s that children &apos;s rhyme that &apos;s also very sexual .
it is not sexual at all .
it is in this case .
carol , i &apos;m g ... i &apos;m gonna need you
to be a little bit nicer to me , please .
oh , my god , are you serious ?
i can &apos;t p ...
listen , i can &apos;t perform sexually if i don &apos;t feel
a @-@ at least a little desired .
okay .
could you give me any sort of a compliment ? anything .
we &apos;ll go and then we &apos;ll just ... that will get me started .
i &apos;ll say something nice about you then and we can get into it .
just one compliment .
nothing on the front . can you turn around ?
no . keep turning .
no . stop . ah !
okay , i won &apos;t ... okay .
please .
first thing that pops in your head .
oh , nicky , you &apos;re such a sexy boy .
it felt crazy coming out of my mouth . right ?

wow , how the hell did he carry that thing ?
bobby , i &apos;m sorry . i feel terrible .
no , no , no , no . it was a bad call .
yeah , i guess it &apos;s weird to have sex with your cousin &apos;s wife .
no .
i ...
i just can &apos;t stomach my kid
coming from a bears fan , that &apos;s all .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with being a bears fan .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m gonna say to that .
there kind of is .
no , it &apos;s weird to have sex with your cousin &apos;s wife .
that &apos;s what &apos;s weird .
we &apos;re gonna ask cousin terry .
he &apos;s got no arm past his elbow ,
but it was an accident ; it &apos;s not genetic .
it &apos;s a good call . he &apos;s very good @-@ looking .
