according to this man &apos;s family , he was not a smoker .
but the truth is , he smoked two packs a day
in his car for 20 years
while his wife and children slept .
sometimes the patient &apos;s shame is the elephant in the room .
they try to hide it from us .
but you can &apos;t hide from a surgeon ,
because the body doesn &apos;t lie .
the truth is right here , for everyone to see .
and it doesn &apos;t need to say a single word .
so , deluca and i are basically not talking .
just like you two .
only different .
obviously .
yeah , i mean , we say &quot; hi , &quot;
but , uh ... there &apos;s no talking .
i mean , after the amazing sex .
once you &apos;ve had that ,
you would think it would be easier to have a conversation .
so ...
that woman starts today -- the resident from dillard .
do you want to talk about that ?
&apos;cause you should .
it doesn &apos;t burn when i pee anymore .
it &apos;s your first day . h @-@ how do you -- how --
it &apos;s okay .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
hi .
can you guys tell me how to find out whose service i &apos;m on ?
i mean , which attending ?
you should ask her .
i &apos;m probably not qualified to answer that .
just check your e @-@ mail .
thank you .
as you know , transfer residents
traditionally do their first rotation
with the chief of general surgery , which is you ,
and , as you also know , our newest transfer ,
penelope blake , is starting today .
so ... you understand how this ... could have happened --
what is &quot; this &quot; ?
dr. blake is on your service .
however , dr. webber has offered to take over .
or i can . you just say the word .
i &apos;ll take blake .
you don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;m chief of general . it &apos;s the job .
you sure ?
of course . i &apos;ll do it .
s @-@ sir ? sir , y @-@ you can &apos;t park there .
oh , no , i &apos;m not parking . i &apos;m just stopping for a sec .
no , this is for patients only .
yeah , yeah , i got a patient . no worries .
all righty .
well , we &apos;re a little late , but we &apos;re here .
you ready for this ?
yeah .
did this case a year ago .
looks amazing .
and we &apos;re doing something like this again today ?
? yeah .
april &apos;s bringing in a kid from jordan with ollier &apos;s disease .
you can see , ? these are the enchondromas .
cartilaginous tumors .
they -- they grow from the growth plates , right ? - ? exactly .
which is why you &apos;re gonna want to do a wide local excision ,
expose the bone so i can get in there
and reconstruct the hand --
wait , wait , wait , wait . i will ?
i &apos;ll dissect the tumors ?
i thought so .
if you &apos;re up for it .
hell yes , i am .
are you ready ? they &apos;re on their way up .
why don &apos;t you head up to peds , help him get settled ?
yeah .
thank you for doing this .
listen , it &apos;s a great case . and it &apos;s just a resection .
he &apos;s such a sweet kid .
he &apos;s an amazing kid .
he &apos;s been through hell in jordan ,
and -- and he just never gives up .
since he lost his family , he &apos;s been living at the hospital ,
and we just -- we give him all these odd jobs to do and --
april , you can stop selling him .
okay ? it &apos;s happening .
we are doing it , so ...
good . just -- i just ...
thanks for putting our stuff aside , and --
let &apos;s go see him .
yes .
i am ...
i understand i &apos;m on your service today .
that &apos;s right .
d @-@ dr. grey , i just want to say ,
i don &apos;t want today to be awkward or uncomfortable .
so don &apos;t make it ? awkward or uncomfortable --
like this , right now .
if there &apos;s anything that i --
consult in the pit . we &apos;re walking .
robert matthews , 30s , fell down two flights of stairs .
possible l.o.c.
he &apos;s been complaining of abdominal pain .
i can arrange for a head c.t. or page neuro .
all i need is an ultrasound .
no ! ?
calm down . okay .
no , i @-@ i have to go !
okay .
relax !
i did something bad -- really bad -- and i ...
where am i ?
how &apos;d i get here ?
relax . you fell down some stairs .
i was trying to get up to the choir loft .
choir loft ?
i &apos;m the pastor at first lutheran , and i had --
there was an accident .
i accidentally ...
oh , god . i have to go !
okay , listen , robert , you have to calm down ,
or you &apos;re gonna make this worse , okay ?
it &apos;s not okay !
i sent it to everyone .
sent what ?
the church bulletin .
i went to attach the video of the youth volleyball game ,
and ... i &apos;ve been seeing someone -- a woman --
a nice , but ... sort of adventurous woman .
but nice and --
okay , now you lost me .
i attached the wrong video .
you sent a sex tape ?
to my entire congregation .
oh , good god !
yeah , can we not talk about him right now ?
i rode on a bus , a train , a plane ,
three cars , and a helicopter .
that &apos;s amazing !
kamal , i want you to meet dr. avery .
he &apos;s gonna perform your operation .
hi .
you are ... the guy ?
&quot; the guy &quot; ?
there she is ! the machine !
nathan !
oh , man !
thank you , thank you , thank you for bringing him here .
hey , come on . of course .
nathan and i worked together on my last tour .
dr. riggs , this is jackson . dr. avery . ?
yeah , nathan riggs . ?
? trauma surgeon ?
cardiothoracic , but over there ,
it &apos;s pretty much all trauma , you know ?
sure . sure , yeah .
dr. riggs ! he is the guy !
what is &quot; the guy &quot; ?
the first time we met kamal ,
keps said , &quot; i know the guy who can fix your hands , &quot;
so ever since , he &apos;s been talking about meeting &quot; the guy . &quot;
well , kamal , let &apos;s take a look , huh ?
okay . let &apos;s get this guy up here .
all right . look at this .
okay .
you can fix them ?
that &apos;s the plan .
you never told me it was this advanced .
the tumors are massive .
okay , maybe i downplayed it a little .
you downplayed it ? ! this looks impossible !
i don &apos;t understand . you sent him the scans , right ?
didn &apos;t you see the scans ?
she told me the scans were lost in jordan .
i didn &apos;t want him to see the scans .
wait . what ?
keps , what the hell ? !
you lied !
if you had seen the scans , you might have said no ,
and i wanted you to meet that little boy .
and he &apos;s here now .
so how do we help him ?
so , blake &apos;s on meredith &apos;s service ?
uh , looks like it .
she gonna be all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
we haven &apos;t spoken since the party .
she feels like i &apos;m on meredith &apos;s side .
and i am , you know ?
but it doesn &apos;t mean ? i &apos;m not on penny &apos;s side , too .
and now meredith &apos;s not even talking to me , so win @-@ win !
oh , god .
78 new messages ?
they know .
they all know .
what &apos;s your assessment ?
well , i think -- - not you -- blake .
ultrasound showed fluid in morison &apos;s pouch .
we should get an abdominal c.t.
and what are we looking for on the c.t. ?
we need to rule out bleeding from the liver or the spleen .
we should also evaluate the retroperitoneal space .
if there &apos;s active bleeding on the c.t. ,
we set him up for an ex @-@ lap .
are you forgetting anything ?
we cleared his c @-@ spine ,
we sent blood out ? for a trauma panel , tox screen ,
alcohol levels .
and ?
and , uh ...
order a type and crossmatch .
of course . obviously . i @-@ i skipped that .
okay , well , let &apos;s not skip steps .
we &apos;re a level i trauma center .
i need to know what dillard taught you .
let &apos;s fill him with fluids and prep him for a c.t.
i didn &apos;t lie . i --
you bent the truth a bit .
until it broke .
it was a good lie .
okay , it was a bad lie , but for a good reason .
you know , you haven &apos;t been saying yes to anything lately --
not when it comes from me .
look at the scans , april .
okay , these areas are pure cartilage , right ?
they probably destroyed any bone that was in their path .
guys , we don &apos;t even know
there &apos;s anything resembling hands underneath these things .
can you even repair the tendons and the neurovascular bundles ?
that &apos;s doubtful .
well , hopkins and case western did similar cases .
they -- they reconstructed using bone grafts .
oh , so have i , and you know those cases
are nothing compared to kamal &apos;s .
april , he &apos;s saying no .
we &apos;ll just keep looking until we find someone .
and they will all say the exact same thing .
thanks .
thanks for taking the time .
look , i &apos;m not saying no .
i &apos;m saying i ... will do some biopsies
so that we can all get a full picture
of what it is ? we &apos;re dealing with here .
thank you .
i heard there was a bad driver in the house .
uncle richard !
man , you look ... bald .
and you look old .
&quot; uncle richard &quot; ?
yeah , adele and i knew paul and his late wife , lois ,
before we got married .
bumpy and i go way back .
&quot; bumpy &quot; ? why &quot; bumpy &quot; ?
morning , angela .
tell me about the accident .
how did it happen ?
all i know is i pressed the brake ,
but the damn car kept going .
right into a tree .
yeah , she &apos;s got a severely displaced clavicular fracture
and a weak pulse in her right arm .
how about paul ?
i &apos;ll be fine . angela got the worst of it .
still , i want to work you up , too , just to be safe .
so i &apos;ll go ahead and schedule that c.t.a.
that sound good to you , bumpy ?
that &apos;ll be quite enough of that .
sorry .
dr. bumpy .
tell me what you see .
retroperitoneal fluid .
around what ? be specific .
the right kidney .
it &apos;s a grade iv injury with an active extravasation .
we are gonna need to do an ex @-@ lap .
should i call upstairs ?
what do we have ?
patient came in ? with a head lac , g.c.s. of 14,
loss of consciousness at the scene --
can you clear the head c.t.
so we can take him up for an ex @-@ lap ?
there &apos;s no shift , contusion , or bleed .
it &apos;s a mild concussion .
i &apos;ll do a quick exam , but he &apos;s cleared for surgery .
is this the pastor ? who gave his congregation
a , ... special blessing ?
word travels fast .
all around the hospital .
yeah , i bet the pews will be full on sunday .
monitor for any neuro deficits .
i will do another check , post @-@ op .
blake , get him ready for transport .
edwards , show her where it is .
it &apos;s not enough to have her here in the same building .
you invited her on your service , too ?
i am trying to rise above .
and you should , too .
no , you should have ended it that night .
forget it .
it was better when we weren &apos;t talking .
as i feared ,
the biopsy showed precancerous cells in the tumor .
both sides .
okay . then we need ? to get in there a.s.a.p. --
april , listen , there is no clear way to excise all the tumor .
so i have to recommend ... amputation .
of both hands .
no .
it is his best shot before it progresses to cancer .
no . i brought him to you to save his hands .
this is how we save his life .
well , i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t see how he survives over there
with no hands and no one to take care of him .
i understand . i &apos;m sorry .
i could have told you sooner
if i had all the information .
you mean you could have given up sooner .
yes , you &apos;re right -- because there &apos;s nothing to be done .
you could try !
you could make an effort
instead of just giving up and walking away !
and you don &apos;t think i want to ?
all right , we &apos;re not doing this .
could you leave us alone for a second , please ?
oh , absolutely , i &apos;m gonna leave ,
and i &apos;m gonna take kamal with me , all right ?
&apos;cause this isn &apos;t about you two ! okay ?
this is about a little boy who had to see his family murdered ,
who saw his home burnt to the ground ,
who would &apos;ve been taken as a child soldier
if it wasn &apos;t for his deformed hands .
all right , he doesn &apos;t have the time
for you guys to be working out your crap !
he deserves the best care he can get ,
and i &apos;m gonna make sure he finds it .
why &apos;d you even bring him to me ?
you saw the scans . you &apos;re a good surgeon .
you knew this was hopeless .
i wasn &apos;t hopeless .
i don &apos;t know why you are .
because there &apos;s nothing here to save .
what &apos;s the trickiest part of a partial nephrectomy ?
well , i think it &apos;s essential that -- - not you -- blake .
mobilizing the colon quickly
to get adequate exposure of the kidney .
by your third year ,
you should know this surgery inside and out .
i do . ? - okay .
so you are gonna walk me through this .
your hands are my hands ,
and my hands do not like making mistakes .
are you ready ?
i am . yes , i &apos;m ready .
with what ? because i have nothing in my hands .
right . uh , 10 blade .
10 blade .
c.t.a. results showed an injury
to an artery in angela &apos;s chest .
she &apos;s on her way to pre @-@ op now .
she doesn &apos;t want you to worry , and neither do i.
? you sound just like bumpy .
you have to tell me why you call him &quot; bumpy . &quot;
well , that &apos;s &apos; cause ,
back in the day , ? when we were in college --
got your results back .
oh , you hurt your foot ?
no , no , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s ... pins and needles , is all .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s just a little numb .
it &apos;ll go away .
i don &apos;t think it will -- not by itself .
your labs show ? elevated hemoglobin a1c levels .
and your blood glucose level is very high .
you &apos;re diabetic .
but you already knew that .
listen , bumpy , i &apos;ve been taking better care of myself .
angela doesn &apos;t know , and -- and i want us to keep it that way .
that pain in your foot ?
it &apos;s a symptom , paul .
it &apos;s called diabetic nerve pain .
it could be the reason you crashed your car .
are you saying i put my baby in the hospital ?
no . it was an accident .
she loves you . she &apos;ll understand .
just tell her --
do you have any children , richard ?
do you ?
no . no , i don &apos;t .
so you don &apos;t know a damn thing .
you can &apos;t possibly understand .
please , just --
just take care of ? my little girl , and leave me be .
i &apos;ll let you know as soon as angela &apos;s out of surgery .
and now jackson wants to amputate .
he won &apos;t even try . he said it was hopeless .
he -- he asked me why i even brought kamal to him .
what ?
well ? why did you ?
i mean , the scans were so bad , you had to lie about them .
you lied ? about a little boy , april .
i &apos;m s-- what -- what are you saying ?
nothing . sorry .
i &apos;m saying , i know what it &apos;s like
when it feels like ? everything &apos;s coming apart
and you need something to pull it together .
i just ...
i know .
are you sure ?
well , maybe you can show them to rogers .
yeah , i &apos;d appreciate it .
all right , call me back . thanks , charlie .
riggs ?
hunt .
what are you doing here ?
april kepner and i met in jordan .
i &apos;ve been working with the relief effort in afghanistan --
yeah , yeah , yeah . what are you doing here ?
we have a patient with ollier &apos;s disease .
brought him in to your hand guy .
and then you &apos;re leaving .
yeah , well , maybe ? a little sooner than i --
i &apos;m not asking you , riggs . i &apos;m telling you .
nice catching up .
incise gerota &apos;s fascia .
now identify and debride devitalized tissue .
go on .
? cauterize cortical bleeders
and establish hemostasis before closure .
now close using ? a running absorbable suture
to avoid post @-@ op fistulas .
you can even reinforce using an absorbable mesh .
well , that &apos;s thinking ahead . i like that .
dr. grey . dr. blake .
i thought i &apos;d stop in to see how the first day was going .
thank you , sir . it &apos;s been --
blake has been dictating my surgical steps .
great . how &apos;s she doing ?
not too well .
if i had done what she just suggested ,
the patient would have major renal cortex bleeding .
what did you miss ?
i -- what ?
what did i do that you missed ?
uh , debride , hemostasis , close ...
come on . figure it out .
i was watching you . i didn &apos;t see .
deluca , can you fill in the blanks ?
um , dr. blake didn &apos;t tell you to clamp the hilum .
dr. grey , the hilum is clamped .
it is , sir , because i clamped it on my own .
i didn &apos;t skip a step , and therefore ,
the patient did not hemorrhage and die .
blake , hand your suction to deluca .
dr. grey , i know this procedure .
you would &apos;ve killed the patient , blake .
if your hands had been my hands on this patient ,
he &apos;d be dead .
it &apos;s that simple .
step away from the table .
what &apos;s wrong ?
dr. grey is what &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m new .
and attendings are hard on residents .
i know that . it &apos;s how we learn .
and she should be hard on me . she should be grilling me .
and i should be able to handle it .
but i let her in my head . i froze .
i knew that surgery backwards and forwards .
okay , i can talk to her .
no . don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
i will figure this out .
it &apos;s not your problem .
i sent the biopsies , the scans to three other guys .
any luck ?
no .
well , i &apos;d like to have been wrong .
hey , look , i &apos;m sorry you got pulled into this , man .
april can be --
no , look , i know .
she &apos;s the machine .
she &apos;s the ... what ?
oh , that &apos;s what we call her over there -- &quot; the machine . &quot;
it never slows down , never lets it get to her .
just makes everyone else want to work harder .
when she decides on something , nothing &apos;s gonna stop her .
? you can &apos;t call that one off .
no , that &apos;s true .
thing is , she &apos;s usually right .
go find out what callie torres is doing right now .
oh . angela &apos;s surgery is over ?
how -- how &apos;d it go ?
did a primary repair of the subclavian artery .
it went very well .
you can tell your friend she &apos;s fine .
maggie , uh ...
about paul --
you know , what he said about my not having children ...
paul knew me with adele , my wife --
i know . i know . ? it &apos;s -- it &apos;s awkward . awful .
no , you don &apos;t have to say another word . i get it .
okay .
i just wanted to make sure --
don &apos;t ... say another word .
are y @-@ you --
no . no , no . of course not . this is , um , this is allergies .
allergies ?
can we please pretend that it &apos;s allergies ?
maggie , if i did something --
no , no . god , no .
you -- you cheated on your wife .
why should you admit that to your friend ?
who would that help ?
not you , not him .
and , you know , ? you don &apos;t owe me anything .
you and i , we &apos;re not --
i don &apos;t know what we are .
that &apos;s just the thing .
i don &apos;t exactly know how to a @-@ address you --
yeah , you don &apos;t have to . ? - but
it &apos;s fine .
you have nothing ? to be ashamed of -- really .
but --
? so , they would just be gone ?
both of them ?
we would have to amputate them
right -- right about here , at the wrist .
you see ?
on both sides .
will i still carry things ?
well , let &apos;s talk about that , buddy .
you &apos;ll be here when i &apos;m done ?
yes . i promise .
you sure about this ?
nope . not even a little bit .
we &apos;ll have a soda waiting for you , okay ?
okay .
god .
all right , guys , how we doing this ?
doing what ?
i figure ? we &apos;ll just debulk the tumor
from the dorsal surface , and you can show me
what , if any , usable bone we can find .
there &apos;s been a change of plans .
yeah , judging by the scans ,
i &apos;m not sure there &apos;s anything at all .
? i know .
it just might end up being the world &apos;s slowest amputation ,
but ... can &apos;t hurt to try .
but ... you told kamal that he wouldn &apos;t --
we lied .
we had to . didn &apos;t want to get his hopes up again .
he &apos;s gonna try ?
you lied ! to me !
it was a good lie . ? come on . it was a good lie .
oh , my god .
he &apos;s gonna try .
we need to talk .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i thought you were stepping up ,
putting blake on your service ,
but what i saw in that o.r. wasn &apos;t teaching .
she crapped out ? on a basic surgical principle .
you were hazing her .
if she cracks under the pressure of an emergent surgery ,
she does not belong in this program .
blake was at the top of her class at dillard .
her references were impeccable . i checked them myself .
you checked ?
so you knew where she was from ?
you checked her case record ?
her losses ?
did you know that she --
she was an excellent candidate .
you were the only reason not to hire her .
and you didn &apos;t find that reason enough ?
your labs are within normal limits .
that &apos;s good news .
i &apos;m on every website .
got an e @-@ mail from our bishop .
i &apos;m fired .
someone &apos;s threatening to bring me up
on charges as a sexual predator .
i &apos;m done .
we &apos;re supposed to be a community .
i make one simple mistake , and they destroyed me .
put it away .
my mother saw it .
her friends won &apos;t talk to her .
everybody &apos;s trying ? to figure out who the woman is ,
as if it &apos;s any of their business .
thank the lord , she &apos;s okay .
at least her life isn &apos;t over , too .
nothing is over .
it &apos;s different for us -- the clergy .
people put their trust in us -- their faith .
we break that trust , it stays broken .
i can &apos;t believe that .
you know who you are .
you can stand up to them and have faith in that --
have faith in yourself .
i have to believe that .
they say he doesn &apos;t give you more than you can handle .
you say that , actually .
yes , i do .
are you okay ?
my stomach .
nurse !
coming !
there is a clot in his catheter . his bladder &apos;s about to rupture .
i need a syringe ? with some saline and heparin ,
and page dr. grey -- now !
right away .
you &apos;re okay .
those nerves are going everywhere .
how do you build something from that ?
well , for what it &apos;s worth ,
i think you were right about him .
he &apos;s good .
i know .
he &apos;s talking about divorce .
well , you kind of saw that coming , though , right ?
he said &quot; don &apos;t go . &quot; you went .
on some level --
it &apos;s not gonna happen . it &apos;s not what i want .
i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s what he wants .
i know it &apos;s not what god wants from me .
we &apos;re looking at a kid who &apos;s lost his family ,
his home ...
might even lose his hands now .
maybe god has more on his mind
than judging whether you get a divorce or not .
don &apos;t you think he has bigger fish to fry ?
i &apos;ve got about 60 % of bone structure over here .
how &apos;s it going over there ?
i only see ? free @-@ floating distal phalanges ,
and some of them are eroded by tumor .
? we &apos;re approaching the carpals -- or what &apos;s left of them .
i &apos;m looking for metacarpals over here .
do you see any viable bone at all ?
well , uh ...
damn it .
what ? what is it ? tell me .
jackson , i &apos;m s-- i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just --
there &apos;s nothing here . i --
no , no , no . wait . just wait one second .
well , no . ? there &apos;s no bone to work with .
i mean , look it . look right here .
there &apos;s fingers , and then there &apos;s nothing .
i don &apos;t -- - ? come on . come on .
jackson , i think --
just wait , okay ?
i think that you were right .
i don &apos;t want to be right , though . i just ...
let &apos;s keep going , please , okay ?
yeah , of course .
put that down !
we are working here !
we &apos;re gonna keep going until we are sure
that there is nothing left .
now , do not pick that up again unless i tell you to .
jackson ?
i &apos;m sorry . i was just --
no , no , no , jackson , look right here . look .
i found something . i found lunate bone .
this is good lunate bone .
what happened ?
i think he clotted his foley .
i &apos;ve flushed it five times . i can &apos;t get a new one in .
he &apos;s hypotensive .
get me a 50 cc with a 14 @-@ gauge needle .
you got it .
how did this happen ?
i was doing a post @-@ op check ,
and i saw that there was blood in his bag .
how long did it take for you to notice ?
i don &apos;t -- uh , we were talking --
you realize if he goes into renal failure ,
this will undo everything we did in the o.r. today .
dr. grey , i didn &apos;t miss this . i caught it .
it shouldn &apos;t have happened !
you froze in the o.r. , you screwed up his post @-@ op care !
is there any part of this job that you can handle , blake ?
i ...
get out . you &apos;re not touching this patient .
you &apos;re off my service .
get out !
now !
all right . the hamate bone &apos;s intact .
there &apos;s the trapezoid ...
and ...
there &apos;s the scaphoid .
that makes four good carpal bones .
which is not much .
and almost no metacarpal .
but we &apos;d have a base for a proximal phalanx ,
so that might regenerate .
he is young , so --
maybe we could sculpt the bone and graft the gap in between ?
we could wire them with rib grafts .
i mean , then i could actually make something out of that .
yes ! look ! look ! that &apos;s a fifth metacarpal head !
look ! right there !
that &apos;s a hand . that is what we needed .
under there , that &apos;s -- that is a hand !
we got a hand , people !
oh , my god !
i can &apos;t friggin &apos; believe it .
i did .
she is going to be fine .
and you should talk to her .
i don &apos;t even know if i can look her in the eye now ,
let alone talk to her .
30 years ago , i had an affair .
i cheated on adele .
and i had a daughter .
i have a daughter .
adele never told lois or anyone about the affair .
she never bashed me to her family .
she lived with that pain and embarrassment for years --
alone .
she protected me , ? and i &apos;m ashamed of that .
it was a mess .
i made a mess .
and for as much pain as i caused and felt ,
i would have never believed
that anything good would have come of it .
but it did .
she did .
and i am very proud to know her .
you were right . she doesn &apos;t belong here .
she almost killed a patient .
she can &apos;t be trusted -- not in the o.r. , not with patients .
she &apos;s just dangerous .
say it again .
what ?
i was right .
i tried to rise above
because ? it &apos;s the right thing to do .
but she has made mistake after mistake ,
and she just is impossible .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s the truth .
she is working at a hospital that is above her skill level .
i have tried to teach her -- all day .
i have tried .
oh , please . you &apos;re being a bully .
and you &apos;ve gone out of your way to make her --
you don &apos;t teach by shoving someone else &apos;s face in the dirt .
that &apos;s not teaching .
that &apos;s just being mean and -- and small .
leave me alone .
since when do you pray ?
i &apos;m not .
or talk to god or whatever .
i &apos;m not talking to god .
well , you talk to tequila .
i &apos;m talking to derek .
okay , i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;m trying .
i tried to rise , i &apos;ve tried to teach her ,
but i just ...
don &apos;t think i can .
i thought he might know
what i &apos;m supposed to do with her ,
why she &apos;s here .
i thought maybe he could tell me .
so , i &apos;m just gonna sit here and ...
wait for some divine intervention or whatever .
they look like hands .
they are .
they &apos;re your hands , bud .
they &apos;re real hands !
i can hold a ball .
take a little bit of time , a few more surgeries , but yes .
what did we tell you ? he &apos;s the guy .
you are the guy .
he never did tell me why they call you &quot; bumpy . &quot;
there was a dance called the bump --
before your time --
and i excelled at it .
you didn &apos;t tell him it was me .
well , i feel , ? if you want to tell people ,
that &apos;s your decision , not mine .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m still trying to figure this out .
okay .
but for the record ...
i &apos;d be fine with it if you did .
very fine .
noted .
april .
i , uh ...
i never said thanks for bringing kamal .
i &apos;m so sorry for lying , but ...
god , you have no idea what you did for that little boy .
no , no , no . you did it .
i mean , you brought him .
&apos;cause i knew you could do it .
okay .
we did it .
just ... thank you .
do you want to go --
hey .
you ready ?
um , nathan &apos;s leaving tomorrow ,
so bailey was gonna take us out for drinks .
she wanted to hear war stories .
um , but i could just tell them that i @-@ i don &apos;t have to go .
oh , no , no . come on . you guys -- you guys go celebrate .
well , come with us .
yeah , come on .
i owe you a drink .
another time .
really , you guys have fun .
i didn &apos;t want blake here . i fought it .
then why did you hire her ?
because i &apos;ve been accused of coddling you ,
and i didn &apos;t want to do that .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d want me to .
that was one reason .
i didn &apos;t want you here , either .
when you were accepted to this program ,
i didn &apos;t know how i was gonna look at you every day ...
and be reminded of the best and worst times of my life .
and you walked in ,
the spitting image of your mother .
talented , smart ...
here -- every day .
and i decided that wasn &apos;t fair to you .
i decided to put aside my personal feelings to --
rise above .
and i &apos;m glad i did that .
every day .
he would have said the same thing .
derek -- he probably would have even liked her .
excuse me . ? i &apos;m looking for a patient .
robert matthews ?
are you his family ?
no , i &apos;m hi-- uh , we work together .
or worked together .
i &apos;m the choir director at our church .
oh . you &apos;re the --
oh . god . you saw it .
well , i mean , of course you saw it .
all of america saw it .
okay , he doesn &apos;t deserve this .
it &apos;s not fair that he &apos;s all of these amazing things ,
and -- and this one mistake
is all anybody &apos;s ? even gonna think about him .
look , can i see him , please ?
i want him to know that ...
you know , he &apos;s got me , at least .
they say shame controls every aspect of human behavior .
it &apos;s about who we believe we are .
this was a mistake .
i don &apos;t think i can do this .
i don &apos;t think that i want to do this .
i kind of went off on grey about you .
callie ... why ?
why are you making this harder ?
i did what i should &apos;ve done at the party .
callie , i get it .
they &apos;re your friends .
he was --
you &apos;re a surgeon .
we make mistakes .
we need to be forgiven .
i will if you will .
and ...
... i &apos;m here .
if ...
... if you are .
i &apos;m here , too .
but in the end , you can &apos;t hide ,
and the body doesn &apos;t lie .
the truth is right there for the world to see .
it &apos;s grey .
she wants me all week .
she still wants to work with me ?
or she still wants to ruin you .
yeah .
yeah , it &apos;s definitely one of those .
come on .
our shame can choke us , kill us .
it can rot us from the inside --
if we decide to let it .
don &apos;t let that happen to you .
