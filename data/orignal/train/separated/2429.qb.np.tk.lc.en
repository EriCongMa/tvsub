i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
love brought me to mystic falls ,
love drove me away .
i love you , damon .
silas .
hello , my shadow self .
bonnie &apos;s dead , elena .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
we &apos;ll do anything to protect the people we love ...
katherine , he needs your blood to cure himself .
no .
silas , you said that now you &apos;re a witch again
you would bring bonnie back from the other side .
i did .
she &apos;s a freaky carbon copy of my one true love amara .
i have to be cured .
amara &apos;s been cured ,
so the fate of the other side ,
rests on a living , breathing human being that we now need to protect .
you ever been in love ?
love . hello , you two .
yeah . we &apos;re together , in love .
aw , that &apos;s so adorable .
i love love . i do . yeah .
i have a soul mate , too ,
you know , that love at first sight ,
want to live forever ,
love is eternal kind of love ?
amara . that &apos;s her name .
see , the problem is when i first met amara ,
i was with another woman , so i kind of cheated on her ,
which to be honest with you ,
it really wouldn &apos;t have been that big of a deal
except it turned out that the other woman was a raging lunatic ,
so when she found out that i cheated on her ,
she freaked out , turned amara into stone ,
like , literally , medusa style .
dude , are you like ... okay ?
what do you mean ? you think i &apos;m crazy ?
why do you think i &apos;m crazy ?
all i &apos;ve wanted for the last 2,000 years
is to be reunited with the love of my life .
how &apos;s that crazy ?
maybe the turned her to stone part .
or the 2,000 years part .
no . guys , we were both immortal ,
and now we &apos;re not .
hello ?
look . the point is i finally had the chance
to hold amara in my arms , and what does she do ?
she jams a chunk of glass into my carotid artery .
look , look .
no , thanks . no .
listen , you two . here &apos;s my advice .
live it up . you know , enjoy this love while it lasts
because let me tell you something .
just a couple days ago , i was psychic ,
i was immortal , i was in love .
now my neck hurts , my soul is crushed ,
i &apos;m sitting in a bus stop in frigging delaware .
you &apos;re in philly .
i &apos;m in philly ?
ohh ! god , it &apos;s even worse .
what &apos;s going on , babe ?
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
hey . talk to me .
oh , my god . what &apos;s happening ?
what are you doing to him ?
i think i &apos;m liquifying his internal organs .
did i fail to mention that i &apos;m a witch ?
please stop .
no , i &apos;m pissed off at the world .
and i &apos;m taking it out on your so @-@ called lover .
please .
i &apos;m thinking you might be my next victim .
oh , my god !
look at that .
unbelievable .
love is so damn fickle .
incredible .
here you go , buddy . come on up .
come on up , come on up . up you go .
that &apos;s good .
buses , however ...
tried and true .
hello , my shadow self .
silas .
stop !
stefan .
morning .
i made coffee .
how did you sleep ?
ohh ... not great .
first night back in your own bed .
not as comfy as tessa &apos;s couch , huh ?
if we &apos;re gonna talk about tessa ,
i think i need that caffeine .
so , uh , what &apos;s with the wakeup call ?
i miss you .
i feel like when you lost your memories
i lost a friend ,
and i was thinking
instead of describing
how much we meant to each other ,
maybe we can just start fresh .
hi . i &apos;m elena .
i was driving to portland .
what ?
the night i took silas to the quarry ,
i said good @-@ bye to lexi , and then i decided to keep driving west .
wait . hang on . how do you remember that ?
because my memories are back .
really ?
are you serious ? how ?
tessa came here last night ,
and she undid whatever spell fried my brain ,
and it &apos;s all back .
i can remember everything .
stefan , this is great !
this is amazing .
october 1852 .
you broke my nose trying to teach me how to throw a right hook .
but not on purpose just to be clear .
how much did you pay for that hunk of junk motorcycle that you ride ?
that &apos;s a trick question .
you bought me that motorcycle ,
although i &apos;m guessing it was pretty expensive .
so tessa just gave you back your memories , no strings attached .
well , it wasn &apos;t exactly a gift .
it &apos;s a lot to take in all at once .
everything from blowing out the candles on my first birthday cake to ...
drowning in a safe .
stefan ?
whoa ! easy there , buddy .
stefan , where did you go ?
uh ... all of that , and i still can &apos;t remember my own strength .
what was that noise ?
uh , well that is--
we have a situation .
of the doppelganger variety .
yeah .
katherine ?
no , nope , not katherine .
i don &apos;t know !
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
i don &apos;t know .
tessa turned her into a block of rock ,
left her in a box for 2,000 years ,
probably went a little stir crazy
like those deserted island guys
who talk to volleyballs .
i said i don &apos;t know !
so you &apos;re telling me that this girl
is the only thing holding together the other side ?
yep . she &apos;s the anchor .
leave me alone .
as long as she &apos;s alive , the other side exists ,
and we can keep trying to get bonnie from over there .
i said i don &apos;t know !
well , considering she &apos;s immortal ,
i &apos;d say we have plenty of opportunity .
you &apos;d think ,
except last night she stuck a hole in silas &apos; neck ,
sucked the cure right out of him ,
so now she &apos;s not only nuts ,
but she &apos;s mortal , which means
we have to keep her ordinary little human heart beating
until we get bonnie back .
how would you plan to do that ?
silas made a pinky promise that he &apos;d do a spell
to bring her back .
unfortunately , he &apos;s taking his sweet time
coming back to mystic falls .
eh , amara , stop !
no ! no !
let me die . i want to die !
let &apos;s hope love is blind
or at least deaf .
it turns out that it &apos;s not gonna be that easy to keep amara alive .
i wonder what will happen
if she dies and the other side gets destroyed .
do you think there will be , like , a white light
and then nothing ?
it won &apos;t hurt , will it ?
oh , it &apos;d suck if it hurt .
bon , there &apos;s something i want to tell you .
actually , there are 3 things that i want to tell you .
don &apos;t you dare give me a good @-@ bye speech .
this is not a good @-@ bye .
that &apos;s the first thing .
ok .
i know one way or another
that you will always be here .
the second is thank you
for giving your life up for me .
jer .
and the third is-
wait .
don &apos;t tell me .
if you don &apos;t tell me , we &apos;ll have to wait until another time ,
which means there will be another time .
i &apos;m not sure it works like that .
just go with it , ok ?
so what am i looking at here , hmm ,
blood clot , tumor , what ?
i did a full workup on your blood , katherine .
it &apos;s clean .
my hair is going gray ,
and my teeth are falling out .
i &apos;m not sure what that suggests ,
but it &apos;s definitely not health .
patient is irritable .
not sure if this is a symptom or personality .
personality .
now tell me exactly what the hell is going on with me .
you &apos;re aging .
what ?
you said you were turned into a vampire
500 years ago , give or take ,
and now that you &apos;re human ,
let &apos;s just say time is catching up with you .
ok . ok . well , how do we stop it ?
we don &apos;t . it &apos;s just life running its course ,
quicker than normal .
how much quicker ?
if it continues at this rate ,
you have a few months .
i &apos;m sorry .
hello , damon .
well , look who decided to pick up his phone .
is your secretary out sick ?
they prefer administrative assistants now , thank you very much .
i learned that on the bus .
very nice people on here by the way .
you &apos;re taking a bus ?
not to sound like a dick , man ,
but we &apos;re in a little bit of a rush over here .
yeah , but you know what &apos;s great about the bus ?
open road , damon .
there &apos;s all this time to think ,
watch everyday human beings in their normal environment .
did you know that gas is over $ 3.00 a gallon at the moment ?
that seems to really concern a lot of people .
this is not a time to have an everyman crisis .
we need you back here to resurrect bonnie
before your nutter butter soul mate
offs herself an destroys the other side .
yeah . i been thinking about that .
amara needs to die .
pardon me ?
my poor amara , all those years trapped in stone
clearly left her unhinged ,
so look , if she doesn &apos;t want to spend another moment on this earth ,
then i &apos;m more than happy to put her out of her misery
and spend the rest of eternity in the afterlife with her ,
but listen , if you want to go ahead and kill her
and save me the trouble , then please by all means .
not till you bring bonnie back , remember ?
promises made metaphorical hands shook .
i &apos;ve been thinking about that , too , damon .
remember when i told you that the universe is working
to draw our doppelgangers together
and you laughed in my face ?
well , if you don &apos;t bring bonnie back from the other side ,
then you &apos;ll be breaking your promise to elena ,
and the idea of jeopardizing your relationship
brings me this perverse amount of joy ,
so i &apos;ve decided not to help you , damon .
and i will see you soon .
i &apos;m looking forward to all this being over . bye .
hey , jesse . you missed our study session again .
where are you ? look . i &apos;m really worried .
just call me .
well ... that was pathetic .
um , i &apos;m sorry ?
leaving a message for a boy who--
what &apos;s the american phrase--
oh--is just not that into you ?
and who are you ?
i &apos;m looking for katherine pierce .
i heard she was living here ,
so i checked your room .
what ? you went into my room ?
do you know where she is or not ?
great . even katherine &apos;s friends are bitches .
i &apos;m not her friend .
are you kidding me ?
i need to speak with you .
um , how do you two know each other ?
katherine is my--
she &apos;s my stylist .
she cuts my hair .
ok . whatever .
so ...
what do you want ?
sit . you &apos;ve been avoiding me .
yeah . i &apos;ve been a busy girl doing busy things .
sit .
we need to buy some more time , protect amara .
maybe we should move her somewhere else .
silas is a witch .
he &apos;s a living , breathing gps tracking device .
he &apos;ll track her wherever we take her .
we can &apos;t let him anywhere near her
until he brings bonnie back .
weren &apos;t you listening to anything ?
he &apos;s not gonna bring her back .
so , what , i should just give up ?
come on , stefan .
you got your memory back .
you know me probably better than anyone else .
do you really think that i &apos;m gonna give up ?
you know what ? you &apos;re right . i do know you .
you put your hope in all the wrong places
and sometimes in the wrong people .
silas needs to die
and put us all out of our misery .
so long as he &apos;s alive , i &apos;m holding out hope that he can still help us .
well , as someone who just spent the last 3 months
at the bottom of a quarry because of the guy ,
i wouldn &apos;t hold your breath , pun intended .
silas needs to die ,
and i need to be the one to kill him , end of story .
how &apos;s our mental patient doing ?
i guess all those years alone sent her over the edge .
relax . i &apos;m--i &apos;m just bringing dinner .
i know you .
i don &apos;t think so .
you &apos;re the hunter .
i never forget a face ,
but silas killed you .
you &apos;re dead .
i was . i came back .
how ?
i said how ?
it was you , wasn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re a witch .
you brought him back .
you can see me ?
of course i can see you .
i &apos;m not blind . i have eyes .
or are you dead ?
i get so mixed up .
i can &apos;t tell the difference between the living or the dead .
can you see people on the other side ?
i am the anchor to the other side .
i can see everything .
don &apos;t touch me !
please don &apos;t-- don &apos;t touch me .
i can touch her .
ok . that &apos;s weird .
jer , i think i &apos;ve got an idea .
amara could see bonnie ,
and bonnie could touch her .
they made physical contact .
it &apos;s like amara &apos;s got foot on each side or something .
amara exists in both places at once ,
here and the other side ?
then she &apos;s not crazy crazy ,
she &apos;s just talking to dead supernatural beings
roaming around in our basement .
that &apos;s not the point .
the point is is if silas isn &apos;t gonna help us ,
what if bonnie could be the same thing ?
what if she existed on both sides at once ?
what if she became the anchor ?
you &apos;re right . jeremy , you &apos;re right .
so all we would need is someone who could do that spell .
oh , please don &apos;t say who i think you &apos;re gonna say .
think about it . silas wants amara to die ,
and amara wants amara to die ,
so who besides us is the one person
with the biggest stake against letting that happen ?
i was hoping we could talk .
and i was hoping you were my chinese food .
good @-@ bye .
you remember amara , right .
brunette , brown eyes ,
i &apos;m surprisingly not in love with her ?
what about her ?
well , she took the cure ,
she wants to die , and we have her .
but she &apos;s alive ?
for now .
silas is literally on his way to kill her .
he &apos;s completely obsessed with destroying the other side
so that he and amara
can live happily ever after in the great beyond .
man , you were right about these doppelgangers .
they do always end up together .
so how does it feel to say , &quot; i told you so &quot; ?
like i want to shoot fireballs at silas
and drown him in acid .
see ? that &apos;s what i thought .
so how would you feel about us making a deal ?
haven &apos;t you heard it &apos;s bad luck to kill your doppelganger ?
yeah ? well , if i don &apos;t kill him , he wins .
and what if he kills you first ?
witches aren &apos;t exactly easy to take down .
we just got you back , stefan .
don &apos;t do anything crazy .
you and i have been down the revenge road ,
and it &apos;s not worth it .
you know , there were these moments in that safe ,
a stillness in time when i was dead .
right before i was about to come back to life ,
i would think about things in the past
that made me happy ,
things that gave me hope .
all these things kept me sane .
they pushed me to hang on
when all i wanted to do was give up and turn off my humanity .
but eventually , the pain took those moments away from me , too .
i &apos;m so sorry .
every time i close my eyes ,
i can see silas stabbing me ,
i can feel myself drowning ,
and i need to make it stop .
if i don &apos;t kill him , i &apos;m gonna lose my mind ,
or i &apos;m gonna turn off my humanity ...
or both .
so here &apos;s my pitch .
in order to keep the other side in place ,
you need something to anchor the spell , right ,
something powerful , like an immortal being powerful .
now amara was obviously a great choice
until she downed the cure .
so would you consider someone who &apos;s dead
but stuck on the other side a viable candidate ?
an anchor swap ?
because i &apos;ve got a volunteer .
i &apos;d be making a ghost a human toll booth
between our side and the other side ,
giving her the power to interact
with our physical world
and the supernatural purgatory .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
i need a massive amount of power
to do a transfer spell like that .
fine . name your poison .
i need something to draw on .
the moon &apos;s not full ,
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s a worthy comet
for another couple billion years .
think hard . i have a girlfriend at home
who misses her best friend
and a wacky stowaway on suicide watch .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
doppelgangers .
they &apos;re powerful , mystical , naturally recurring .
you want doppelganger blood ?
i got doppelgangers coming out of my ears .
how many do you want ?
you hate junk food .
you call it toxic poison .
yeah ? well , i &apos;ve decided to live a little .
now may i be excused ,
scary vampire daughter ?
you &apos;ve been avoiding me .
i don &apos;t like it .
clearly .
we had a moment , you and i.
there was a bond . i felt it ,
and then nothing .
you abandoned me all over again .
ok . first of all ,
i never abandoned you .
you were snatched out of my arms at birth
because my father thought i was a knocked @-@ up , shameful slut ,
and second of all , it &apos;s been 500 years .
do we really have to do this whole
mother @-@ daughter bonding thing ?
estrangement is so much easier , don &apos;t you think ?
sorry to interrupt the world &apos;s weirdest lunch ,
but , you with the doppelganger blood , duty calls .
wonderful . now that katherine &apos;s a human and fragile ,
everyone thinks that they can just boss her around .
hands off , ok ? i &apos;m going .
we &apos;re not done .
oh , yes , we are .
so you live in this giant mansion
with two doppelgangers that are destined to end up together ?
i swear there &apos;s a sitcom in there somewhere .
so where &apos;s the ancient boyfriend @-@ stealing bitch ?
this way .
that &apos;ll be all .
well , if it isn &apos;t the face that launched
a thousand doppelgangers .
a little birdie told me you aren &apos;t enjoying
your immortal life .
2,000 years , you have nothing to say to me ?
no apology ?
i &apos;m sorry .
what was that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
that is what you want to hear , isn &apos;t it ,
how i have suffered ,
how every moment of my life has been a living a hell ?
it has !
my sin was falling in love ,
and i &apos;ve learned my lesson .
you win .
you win . now please kill me .
please .
please kill me !
don &apos;t worry .
when i make someone else the anchor , i will ,
and since you &apos;re nothing more than a non @-@ supernatural human ,
you &apos;ll pass on while silas is trapped on the other side ,
and then you and silas ,
you &apos;re gonna spend eternity apart ...
and that is gonna be kind of fantastic
for me .
selfishly speaking .
the cute one &apos;s here .
she &apos;s all yours .
let me guess . you must be ...
who now ?
let &apos;s be clear .
i don &apos;t care about bonnie bennett
or the other side going away
or elena getting her best friend back .
you want something ? i &apos;m shocked .
i had the cure you created running through my veins ,
and when silas sucked it out of me ,
i started aging faster than normal .
so basically , i &apos;m dying ,
and i need you to fix me .
you made the cure .
now make something that stops the aging .
otherwise , no blood for you .
fine . when the ritual &apos;s finished
and bonnie is the anchor ,
we &apos;ll find a way to stop you from dying .
thank you .
now where &apos;s tweedledee and tweedledum ?
what is that ?
it &apos;s bonnie &apos;s grimoire .
a grim--what ?
it &apos;s a magic spell book .
idiot .
it &apos;s a talisman .
since bonnie can &apos;t be here ,
here grimoire will have to do .
hands in , palms up .
sorry , love . did that hurt ?
i &apos;ve been through worse .
easy , ok ? i &apos;m fragile these days .
showoff .
inah ahpran koh sahtee ha jem .
ay pahta kay rasa tahn .
inah ahpran koh sahtee ha jem .
ay pahta kay rasa tahn .
inah ahpran koh sahtee ha jem .
ay pahta kay rasa tahn .
no .
is it done ?
no , it &apos;s not done .
what &apos;s happening ?
silas is happening .
show yourself , bastard !
i can &apos;t see anything . can you ?
electricity &apos;s out in the whole house .
what happened ?
silas is here .
well , silas owes me a fuse box .
hang on . i only count two doppelgangers .
where &apos;s crazy pants ?
and where &apos;s the other crazy ?
that was quite the show , silas .
thank you .
you haven &apos;t seen the love of my life
running around here by any chance , have you ?
nope . maybe you shouldn &apos;t have turned the lights off , genius .
you &apos;ve had 2,000 years to watch us suffer .
you &apos;ve had your fun .
why can &apos;t you just let it go ?
maybe i &apos;m just not wired that way .
honestly , i feel sorry for you .
hateful vengeance is for people without real love .
you spent 2,000 years waiting for me to die
just so you could be with me
when all along the universe knew i belonged to somebody else .
doesn &apos;t that make your whole existence ,
like , i don &apos;t know , a total waste ?
i loved you .
yeah ? well , get in line .
sucky timing , stefan .
i disagree .
i have amara just beyond the property line .
you have 10 minutes to come find us .
well , i &apos;m a little busy right now
watching my nemesis bite it .
plus i have no interest in saving amara &apos;s life .
i know that , which is why i &apos;m gonna take her away ,
and i &apos;m gonna keep her alive by any means possible
while everyone else hunts you down like an animal .
you now have 9 minutes .
katherine ?
what are you doing ?
tessa &apos;s stupid nonsurgical incision won &apos;t stop bleeding .
here .
heal .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . just another tragic side effect
from taking that cure .
apparently the universe just doesn &apos;t want me
to heal from vampire blood .
stupid universe .
find me that damn witch so she can finish that spell !
no .
no way .
can &apos;t a witch rest in peace ?
it &apos;s a flesh wound . get up .
you &apos;re not done yet .
come on .
oh , god .
amara .
i loved you .
i still do ...
but i can &apos;t live any longer .
please understand .
i understand .
i love you .
silas , please .
i &apos;m ready .
do you remember me ?
i remember you .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . is it hard to breathe ?
is your throat closing ?
did the fear of dying start to creep in yet ?
i hear every emotion is heightened for a vampire .
all those memories must be eating you alive right now , stefan .
what &apos;s it like to die ?
i &apos;ve never done it .
you must have done it , what , a thousand times over the summer ?
stop it .
stop ? i spent 2,000 years alone in a tomb .
you were locked up for , what , 3 months ?
look at you . you &apos;re a mess .
the safe was the easy part , wasn &apos;t it ?
being forgotten about ,
that &apos;s the real torture , isn &apos;t it ?
silas !
stefan and amara are not inside .
that &apos;s because stefan took her .
you have to go find him before he gets himself killed .
no . he &apos;s luring silas away so we can finish this .
it &apos;s typical stefan . he &apos;ll be fine .
he &apos;s hurting .
damon , he &apos;s not thinking clearly .
ok . silas may have been the one that put him in that safe ,
but we were supposed to get him out of it .
please go find him .
we can &apos;t lose him again .
ok .
inah ahpran koh sahtee ha jem .
ay pahta kay rasa tahn .
our journey starts now .
no !
amara . no . amara , amara .
drink this . drink . more .
no , no , no . ok .
no . hey . stay with me .
look at me , look at me .
amara , amara . hey ! look at me .
i &apos;ve been in hell for 2,000 years .
what &apos;s another 5 minutes , huh ?
let me die .
no ! amara !
come on . please .
ay pahta kay rasa tahn .
i came to say good @-@ bye .
what are you talking about ?
tessa &apos;s doing the spell .
amara &apos;s dying , jer .
no . that &apos;s impossible . damon--
stop . we don &apos;t have much time .
ay pahta kay rasa tahn .
ay pahta kay rasa tahn .
amara , amara !
please , amara !
tell me the third thing .
bon .
tell me , please .
ay pahta kay rasa tahn .
i love you .
i love you , too .
i &apos;m not ready to let you go .
i can feel you !
i can feel you .
bonnie ?
please tell me this is real .
oh , my god .
you guys can see me ?
bonnie , it worked .
it worked !
you &apos;re here !
thank you .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
and we can be roommates
because we have an extra bed ,
and we can clear out half the closet !
caroline .
caroline .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re really here !
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m back .
i miss this .
i miss feeling warm .
i never felt warm on the other side .
i miss this ...
holding your hand .
i &apos;m never gonna let you go again .
ok . i &apos;m ready .
let &apos;s do this .
you . right .
you want me to stop the aging ?
i &apos;d find a drug store cream .
hilarious , but see the thing is ,
i &apos;m not getting any younger ,
so spell away .
altering someone &apos;s lifespan
is what started this whole mess in the first place .
i &apos;ve learned my lesson .
i &apos;m not saving your life .
excuse me ?
i won .
amara &apos;s gone ,
and silas is waiting for me on the other side .
no . no !
help . help ! somebody , help her !
she &apos;s dying ! don &apos;t die .
i need you .
true love prevails ...
the universe be damned .
no !
you &apos;re the anchor now .
tessa .
where did you just come from ?
i &apos;m dead .
as i pass through you ,
you &apos;ll feel my death .
you &apos;ll feel every death .
every supernatural being that passes over to the other side
will pass through you .
sorry .
that &apos;s gonna hurt like a bitch .
so he &apos;s dead ? it &apos;s over ?
yeah , it &apos;s over .
are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
look at me and tell me that killing silas worked ,
that you &apos;ll be ok now .
why is this so important to you ?
because i know how much he stole from you .
yeah , and he &apos;s dead .
and because while you were suffering
in that safe , grasping onto hope ,
fighting every second
so that you wouldn &apos;t lose your humanity ,
i was happy .
i got everything that i wanted , stefan .
i got to be in love ,
i got the summer of my dreams ,
i got bonnie back .
so i need to know that this worked .
i need to know that it &apos;s gonna take away all of your suffering .
i need to know that you &apos;re gonna be ok .
i wanted it to be you .
when that safe finally opened
and somebody found me ,
i wanted it to be you .
i wanted it to be both of you .
um ... now that bonnie &apos;s back ...
your room &apos;s full . got it .
i &apos;ll just get my stuff .
thank you for what you did today .
enough . i killed you once , don &apos;t forget .
we still hate each other , ok ?
yes , you did , and , yes , we do .
where the hell is my bag ?
already packed .
you again .
i &apos;m leaving , katherine .
i &apos;m heading back to prague ,
and i &apos;d really like it if you came with me .
we can go to bulgaria , retrace our lives .
i don &apos;t know what kind of
twisted fantasy you have about us ,
but that &apos;s all it is , a fantasy .
i would rather rip my own heart out
than do more mother @-@ daughter bonding with you ,
and i &apos;m human now ,
so it wouldn &apos;t really be that easy .
i don &apos;t want to know you .
mother @-@ daughter ? she &apos;s your--
i &apos;m doing you a favor , nadia , ok ?
i can &apos;t be there for you ,
so take a good look
because you are never gonna see me again .
hello , my shadow self .
look at me and tell me
that you &apos;ll be ok now .
he &apos;s dead ? it &apos;s over ?
it &apos;s over ?
no .
no .
it &apos;s over .
