what are you doing back ?
we can &apos;t go over this again .
go home . get some sleep .
it is so weird watching your mother try to rebound .
well , taking care of her appearance is a good sign , actually .
she &apos;s flirting with everything that moves .
did she tell you why cavanaugh broke it off ?
no .
i wish she &apos;d talk about it .
do you know the average woman ingests 7 pounds of lipstick
over a lifetime ?
why do you insist on telling me
your disgusting fun facts over food ?
it &apos;s coffee .
hiya , doll !
hi !
detective .
of all the knuckleheads she &apos;s gonna flirt with --
she has to flirt with lightning mcqueen ?
i thought his name was detective gibson .
i believe he &apos;s part of the auto @-@ theft task force .
that explains why he &apos;s so arrogant .
watch this . watch .
if you were a car ,
you &apos;d be a &apos; 68 dodge charger --
sleek styling , great street performance .
hey , detective .
i was , uh , i was just telling your mother
about this , uh , &apos; 68 dodge charger we recovered .
really ?
i thought you were about to compliment her on her trunk space .
jane !
good morning , lieutenant .
what &apos;s good about it ?
so ... rich , i guess you &apos;ll have your usual .
angela , how can you know me so well ?
now she &apos;s trying to make cavanaugh jealous ?
jealousy can sometimes be a sign of love or commitment .
it can also be a sign that lightning mcqueen
is about to get his ass kicked .
so , i &apos;ll be seeing you , beautiful .
okay . bye , rich .
i will call you .
okay .
hey , mrs. rizzoli , if you &apos;re not too busy ,
can i get some coffee over here ?
right away , lieutenant .
i can &apos;t watch any more .
we have to do something .
what ? hide all the plastic knives ?
vanilla .
just who i was looking for .
i thought you wanted some coffee .
uh , never mind .
hello , mr. rondo . who do we have here ?
reuben , dania , trevor .
it &apos;s dawg .
how do you do , dawg ?
rondo , aren &apos;t we a little old for playdates ?
these are all my homies from &quot; off the street . &quot;
the home for teenagers ?
i volunteer there .
we &apos;re &quot; rondo &apos;s rejects . &quot;
perhaps you &apos;d consider a less pejorative name .
juveniles often identify with the labels society gives them .
oh , society didn &apos;t name them . they named their own selves .
um , a reject is a person or thing
dismissed as failing to meet standards -- - maura .
&quot; pejorative &quot; is a word
that expresses contempt or disapproval .
brought &apos; em by to meet my heroes --
a little impromptu &quot; career day . &quot;
wow . so you guys want to be cops ?
no . no way .
they just need a little mentoring .
maybe you could ... take &apos; em around a little ?
i @-@ i could be a mentor , too . does anybody like cooking ?
cooking !
or science ?
science !
okay , ma , why don &apos;t you give them a doughnut ,
and we &apos;ll let you be on your way ?
fine by me .
right ? i ain &apos;t being mentored by no chick , anyway .
you know , now that i think about it ,
we love to mentor here .
and we can find a boy detective , if that &apos;s what you &apos;d prefer .
detective frost could be your mentor .
and sergeant korsak could be your mentor .
if i have to have a mentor ,
i &apos;d rather it be someone with an advanced degree .
i have an m.d.
okay , i guess .
you got anything to eat ?
okay , ma , we got to go . we got a case .
all right , come on . i &apos;ll make you all breakfast .
frankie !
come here !
i need you to do something .
you got a big case ?
you see those teenagers over there ?
run their names -- make sure they haven &apos;t killed anybody .
you mean the ones standing 6 inches from ma ?
you probably shouldn &apos;t let them out of your sight , either .
where would luke skywalker be without yoda ?
or the karate kid without mr. miyagi ?
okay , i said i would do it . i &apos;ll be a mentor .
agnodice was the first female gynecologist
in ancient athens .
she was one of my mentors .
you mean when you time @-@ traveled back to the 1st century ?
3rd century b.c.
marie curie was also a big influencer of mine .
who were your mentors ?
uh , police woman , kojak ...
oh ! jim rockford .
what was he cooking ?
beer .
beer ?
he &apos;s a microbrewer . this is his test kitchen .
victim is greg jensen ,
c.e.o. and brewmaster of overlord ale .
who found the body ?
jensen &apos;s assistant , ruby burke .
she found him this morning .
and then i came back , and ...
she have an alibi ?
yeah , she was in scandinavia for the last month .
she was selling her boss &apos;s viking @-@ themed beer .
she flew in from reykjavik this morning .
when was he killed ?
he &apos;s been dead at least eight hours .
sweet poster girl .
no kidding .
uh , gentlemen ?
do we have any suspects ?
oh , victim &apos;s married . wife &apos;s been notified .
says she was home taking care of their two young kids .
we &apos;re bringing her in .
2.5 @-@ centimeter round hole .
that &apos;s a very unusual entrance wound .
what was he stabbed with ?
not a knife .
are we playing &quot; process of elimination &quot; again ?
yes .
it &apos;s not a garbage disposal ,
cleaver , pitchfork ,
pinking shears ...
uh , ladies ?
right .
but this ... appears to be a metal rivet .
maybe it came off the murder weapon .
there &apos;s some blood droplets ...
... leading into that mill .
i think we just found what &apos;s left of our murder weapon .
the trace confirmed that the blood on the stick belonged to jensen .
you think a sharpened stick could do that kind of damage ?
yeah .
doesn &apos;t explain the metal rivet , though .
hey . jane .
oh , my g-- frankie , i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , no problem .
i &apos;ve been having a barrel of laughs with your mentees .
who has mentees ?
um ... you .
and you .
apparently , maura and jane volunteered all of us --
toured booking , properties .
i was just about to show them how i write a traffic ticket .
this is snore @-@ ville -- population , you .
they &apos;re all yours .
hey . hello .
hi !
please ... don &apos;t play with that .
why you got a doll , man ?
i was wondering if i could go see the medical examiner ,
maybe check out an autopsy ?
uh ... no .
why not ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s not on the itinerary .
i &apos;m taking a.p. bio , so --
advanced @-@ placement biology ?
yeah
what , you think a reject kid can &apos;t be smart ?
at least reject kids don &apos;t play with dolls .
wait . i bet you call him an action figure ,
right , bro ?
yes , and if you touch my &quot; action figure &quot; again ,
i will break your face .
if i could observe an autopsy ,
it &apos;d count for extra credit .
okay , fine .
but you need to have your parents sign
this liability release waiver .
no , dania , your parents got to --
it &apos;s legal . i &apos;m emancipated .
my mom &apos;s dead , and my dad &apos;s in prison .
if you don &apos;t believe me , here are my documents .
okay . come on .
w @-@ w @-@ w @-@ w @-@ wait . we want to see dead bodies , too .
yeah . better than this bullshit .
oh , shoot .
i bet you wish you picked the &quot; chick &quot; detective now .
sorry , fellas .
cover him up .
cover him up , maura . cover him up .
hi .
you &apos;re about to do the &quot; y &quot; incision ?
yes !
and do you know why the &quot; y , &quot; dania ?
to facilitate the removal of the breastplate .
go ahead . do it .
uh ... no .
our release form doesn &apos;t cover slicing and dicing .
you said i could check out an autopsy .
i didn &apos;t say which part .
okay , so , the first thing that i do
is examine the body .
does your release form cover gloves ?
yes .
all right . do you notice anything ?
his leg &apos;s a little swollen , but i don &apos;t see an injury .
you &apos;re very observant .
you think it could be deep @-@ vein thrombosis ?
i read about this war correspondent
who died from sitting in one place for too long .
better be careful , maura .
i think we found your replacement .
can i see the wound ?
what kind of weapon did that ?
i &apos;m not sure .
but the ragged wound edges suggest
some kind of a barbed blade .
detective , can you help me turn him on his side ?
yeah , sure .
okay .
there we go .
we &apos;ll take a closer look with the fluoroscope .
there &apos;s something lodged near t @-@ 8 .
looks like some kind of spear tip .
it looks like an iron krokspjot .
aha ! just as i suspected
- a crockpot .
krokspjots like this were used during the viking era .
i think these are rune letters carved into the metal .
the runic alphabet is an ancient nordic one
that predates latin .
can you read what it says ?
no . i &apos;ll have to consult a runic scholar .
well , greg jensen sold viking @-@ themed beer .
maybe the spear tip came from his brewery or his office .
okay , frost and korsak have a lead on a possible suspect .
come on , dania .
cool . can i watch you intimidate the suspect ?
no . but hurry .
i don &apos;t want you to miss my mother &apos;s cooking class .
thank your mom for that cooking class .
dawg and reuben almost
got slapped upside the head .
korsak , you were gonna hit your mentees ?
not me -- frost .
mr. chill can &apos;t take teen &apos; tude .
take a look at this .
that is the overlord ale logo .
but look at this .
why would a brother want to be in a nordic motorcycle gang ?
ragnarok riders is a motorcycclub .
it &apos;s not a gang , frost .
well , the motorcycle @-@ club logo is
similar to overlord ale .
don &apos;t tell me our victim lifted a motorcycle club &apos;s logo .
it gets worse .
see the sexy viking poster girl ?
yes .
meet sophie west .
here she is with her daddy .
clark &quot; skull crusher &quot; west --
head of the ragnarok riders .
he sued greg jensen , claiming copyright infringement .
yeah , &apos; cause he couldn &apos;t sue for daughter infringement .
jensen paid sophie to be the model for overlord ale .
daddy sued over the logo and lost .
the guy &apos;s a sore loser .
hey , you watch yourself , pencil neck .
you watch your back .
this battle isn &apos;t over .
oh , i think we should pay skull crusher a visit .
that &apos;s not a drill . nothing &apos;s scheduled today .
get the hell out of here , people !
let &apos;s move -- now !
go !
i left my mask from nairobi inside .
i left my lucky notepad .
i should &apos;ve grabbed my swiss lithographs .
look at this building . do you see any smoke ?
no .
and does your super @-@ sniffer nose smell any smoke ?
no .
i think one of rondo &apos;s rejects
pulled the fire alarm
to get out of ma &apos;s &quot; fun with fresh produce &quot; lecture .
all right , everybody .
some joker pulled the fire alarm .
let &apos;s get back to work .
told you -- false alarm .
frankie !
ma . what &apos;s the matter ?
someone stole my wallet !
okay , i cashed my paycheck .
i put my wallet in my purse .
i keep my purse underneath the counter , like i always do .
that &apos;s not very safe .
clearly , maura . thank you .
you don &apos;t think ...
yeah.do think .
me too .
i &apos;m gonna go put these masks away .
okay , put them in the safe .
i don &apos;t have a safe .
no one &apos;s taking your masks , maura .
okay , which one of you snapped the wallet ? hmm ?
look , anyone of you that &quot; found &quot; my mother &apos;s wallet ,
you return it now , we don &apos;t press charges .
you heard detective vanilla .
if one of you is the guilty party ,
guilty party better speak up .
i didn &apos;t steal no wallet .
me either .
i want a lawyer .
stand up .
do it !
hold your hands out .
whoever pulled the fire alarm is gonna have u.v. dye residue .
so ?
i touched the alarm to turn it off .
sure you did .
i didn &apos;t steal no wallet , all right ?
you can &apos;t prove nothin &apos; .
no , but we can file a misdemeanor for pulling the alarm .
i @-@ i know it don &apos;t seem like it , but they &apos;re all good kids .
dawg has a scholarship to bcu ,
and he could lose it if he gets in trouble .
&quot; if &quot; ?
oh , he &apos;s in trouble .
you find that wallet , rondo . then we &apos;ll talk .
i feel bad .
well , you think 20 minutes with us
is gonna turn their lives around ?
hello . are you here to support the kids &apos; cancer ride , too ?
uh , boston homicide . we &apos;re looking for clark west .
clark !
what do you want ?
we &apos;re investigating a homicide .
i wasn &apos;t asking you . i was asking the lady .
clark west .
my friends call me &quot; skull crusher . &quot;
can you ride bitch , detective ?
no . i &apos;m a terrible passenger .
we &apos;re here about a murder .
i &apos;m busy -- getting ready for a charity ride .
here &apos;s your choice -- you can answer our questions
or enjoy a bitch ride in a squad car
back to headquarters .
you got 30 seconds of my attention .
greg jensen , the beer maker you sued ,
was murdered yesterday .
well , guy &apos;s a prick .
he might have had something like that coming .
we have video of you threatening greg jensen at the courthouse .
he stole my club logo ,
made my daughter his marketing bitch .
where were you yesterday ?
yesterday ...
mass general , pediatric cancer center ,
bringing toys and books to the kids .
you want to see the photos ?
big karl here maxed out the camera memory .
really cute .
it was sad , though .
good luck with your ride .
thank you .
i e @-@ mailed a photo of the rune letters on the spear tip
to my old nordic @-@ history professor .
it says &quot; olaf the boneless . &quot;
it &apos;s a ... recipe for viking soup ?
hmm . could they have meant &quot; ivar , &quot; i wonder ?
mm . you too ?
well , there was a viking leader named ivar the boneless .
some scholars believed that he was a disabled dwarf
who was carried into battle on his shield .
he was a great warrior .
how is a boneless dwarf on a shield a great warrior --
how do you manage to do this ?
do what ?
a boneless dwarf --
what was so urgent ?
the crime lab found seminal fluid
mixed with vaginal secretions in the victim &apos;s tyvek suit .
it appears to be a month old .
&quot; in &quot; ?
so our victim had sex about a month ago
and then wore his disposable tyvek suit again ?
yes .
and they also found vaginal secretions on the spear .
okay , that qualifies as the grossest trace evidence ever .
relax . the secretions were here .
probably from transfer .
also about a month old .
and there was enough cellular material in both to extract dna .
we &apos;re running it .
so our killer could be a woman .
well , since a weapon this sharp
doesn &apos;t need much force , it &apos;s possible .
korsak is interviewing the victim &apos;s wife .
i need one of those swabby things .
w-- stop ! i &apos;ll get you whatever you &apos;re looking for .
but i need a more precise description .
i have to figure out what you say all day long .
you can &apos;t figure out &quot; swabby thing &quot; ? really ?
mrs. jensen , this is detective rizzoli .
very sorry for your loss .
thank you .
mrs. jensen was just telling me
that her husband often disappeared for days at a time .
you have any idea where he was going ?
he said he was working on a new ale recipe .
but i had my suspicions .
i think he was having an affair .
i &apos;m right , aren &apos;t i ?
we found a woman &apos;s dna on your husband &apos;s clothing .
was he gone for an extended period of time
about a month ago ?
this has been going on for almost a year .
you understand that we &apos;ll need to rule you out
as a source of that dna ?
yeah , of course .
whatever you guys need .
i found a second phone in my husband &apos;s car .
i believe they &apos;re called &quot; burn &quot; phones .
i wrote the number down .
maybe that &apos;ll help .
thank you .
what were you thinking detective frost .
i wasn &apos;t thinking , sir .
you sure as hell weren &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
what was that all about ?
i made hazelnut coffee .
apparently , he doesn &apos;t like hazelnut .
oh , boy .
why is cavanaugh in such a lousy mood ?
&apos;cause he broke up with my mother .
you &apos;re kidding me .
you don &apos;t look too surprised .
uh ... your mother confided in me ,
and asked me not to say anything .
well , good . i &apos;m glad she had you to talk to . she was really hurt .
i think she still likes him .
how do you feel about that ?
like it &apos;s time to set a good example for mrs. buttinsky
and not be detectibuttinsky .
run this number , will you ? it &apos;s our victim &apos;s burn phone .
wife seems clean to me .
me too .
i &apos;m guessing ol &apos; greg wasn &apos;t calling home
on that second phone .
yeah , he was .
but not the family home .
our boy had two phones for two addresses .
he was using his secret batphone
to call ...
a back bay condo he bought a year ago .
i &apos;m thinking not only was he cheating on his wife ,
he had a little love nest .
let &apos;s go toss it .
boston police ! open the door !
clear .
i think all that yelling is just this game .
clear .
olaf the boneless .
that &apos;s the same name
that was on the spear tip that killed him .
must be jensen &apos;s user name .
man . he liked playing .
he &apos;s logged 2,738 hours .
he has some high @-@ level weapons , too --
porgeir &apos;s ax , thor &apos;s hammer .
and a saga shield ?
damn !
you seem to know a lot about this , frost .
i &apos;ve dabbled in m.m.o.r.p.g.
have you ?
massive multiplayer online role @-@ playing games .
this one &apos;s called &quot; vikings of the realm . &quot;
why would you waste 2,700 hours playing a computer game ?
points .
points for what ?
to win !
win what ? !
okay , so ... greg jensen
ran a successful microbrewing company ,
but he pretended to be &quot; olaf the boneless &quot; most of the time .
look at this --
snail mail , addressed to the victim at a p.o. box , sent within the last month .
no return address . can &apos;t read it .
looks like it &apos;s written in rune .
hey , look at this .
&quot; your whore is next . &quot;
i &apos;m thinking our killer isn &apos;t done .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s more cost @-@ effective
to get a quart of frozen yogurt if we &apos;re sharing the same flavors .
i like my own , okay ?
well , why don &apos;t you like it swirled ?
it &apos;s still mocha and mint .
no . when you swirl it , it becomes one flavor .
coffee toothpaste .
don &apos;t get your pepperoni grease on my half .
okay , get your mushroom off my half .
did you talk to your mother ?
lieutenant cavanaugh looked miserable when we left .
well , maybe because we have an unsolved homicide
with a killer hiding in a video game .
who &apos;s that ?
he did not ! a lavender vw bug ?
god &apos;s honest truth -- lavender , for a guy who &apos;s ...
you feel me ?
who &apos;s gonna feel you , detective gibson ?
detective rizzoli .
how are you ?
uh ... i was just dropping your mother off .
did you permit this ?
well , i insisted they each have one foot on the floor
when there &apos;s heavy petting on your mother &apos;s bed .
you &apos;re so funny .
uh , ma , can i talk to you for a sec ?
uh ... s @-@ sure .
oh , hey , i &apos;m just gonna go upstairs .
i think i forgot to charge my electric toothbrush .
okay , why are you doing this to lieutenant cavanaugh ?
okay , jane , this is so not your business .
yeah , it is .
especially when he &apos;s taking it out on all of us .
the -- the entire squad .
well , then he &apos;s more juvenile than i thought he was .
you want to hear juvenile ?
&quot; if you were a car , you &apos;d be a &apos; 68 dodge charger . &quot;
you don &apos;t even like that goofball .
don &apos;t call him that .
and i do , too !
i don &apos;t believe you .
and if you are doing this just to get to cavanaugh ,
then i &apos;m gonna say the same thing you told me .
don &apos;t . it &apos;s beneath you .
jane .
wh-- ma ? a @-@ are you crying ?
i &apos;m so proud of you .
w @-@ w @-@ why are you crying ?
because i raised you -- i raised a beautiful girl .
and ...
... you &apos;re right .
thank you .
i love you , ma .
i love you more .
thanks , gorgeous .
detective .
that &apos;s a good sign .
at least she &apos;s not drawing attention to her mouth .
no sign of flirtation .
i needed a pick @-@ me @-@ up after that porsche fiasco .
you hear about this , rizzoli ?
everybody &apos;s talking about it .
oh , yeah , everyone &apos;s talking about that old &quot; porsh , &quot; gibson .
it &apos;s &quot; porsh @-@ ah . &quot;
really ?
&quot; gibson &quot; is an italian name ?
no .
but some of us know a lot about high @-@ end italian rides .
it &apos;s a german car , you idiot .
i think they &apos;re crotch @-@ blocking each other .
&quot; crotch @-@ blocking &quot; ? really ?
it &apos;s my old nordic @-@ history professor .
his office says he &apos;s almost here .
mrs. vanilla .
we found your wallet !
rondo , thank you !
oh ! where &apos;d you find it , rondo ?
i knew you guys didn &apos;t take it .
well , we checked the trash . dania found it in a dumpster .
is everything there , ma ?
well , my license , my atm card , my cash --
i &apos;m missing 100 bucks .
are you sure , mrs. vanilla ?
okay , dawg , let &apos;s go . we &apos;re going upstairs to booking .
no , jane , wait . let me handle this .
how would your mother feel ?
she wouldn &apos;t be very proud , would she ?
um ... dawg doesn &apos;t have a mother .
his mother passed .
oh , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sor--
don &apos;t cry .
don &apos;t cry . all right .
he didn &apos;t do it .
he &apos;s covering for me .
the money &apos;s there . i put it back .
dania , why would you steal from me ?
i needed $ 100 for a textbook .
well , why didn &apos;t you tell the teacher ?
i didn &apos;t want her to know --
what ?
that -- that you live in a teen shelter ?
yeah .
you went to the bathroom .
i took the wallet out of your purse .
dawg saw you coming ,
and he pulled the alarm to cover for me .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
jane .
this is professor walter lowell
from the department of scandinavian studies
at boston cambridge university .
hello . it &apos;s nice to meet you .
the pleasure is mine .
dr. isles was about to show me some letters
written in the rune alphabet
that you all would like me to translate .
yes . i have some of the letters here .
we made copies of the originals .
oh , floppy disks ?
oh , yes , i certainly do remember
when the floppies were the originals .
when you said &quot; old , &quot; i didn &apos;t realize
that you meant he and olaf went on viking raids together .
he &apos;s hard of hearing , but he can read lips .
these appear to be written in proto @-@ norse .
that &apos;s an indo @-@ european language spoken in scandinavia .
it &apos;s thought to have evolved
as a proto @-@ germanic northern dialect
over the 1st century a.d ..
please -- one nerd at a time .
well , these are love letters
addressed to a viking by the name of olaf the boneless .
no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s historically incorrect .
it &apos;s ivar the boneless .
i hope he &apos;s not charging us by the hour .
stop .
they were written by olaf &apos;s lover ,
a viking maiden by the name of gunnhild .
oh , dear .
olaf was still married to a different viking maiden
by the name of undirmaor .
you know , &quot; undirmaor &quot; means --
not now , maura .
exactly how deep into this game was he ?
listen to this .
&quot; your velvety beard still hums
against the bosom of my tender flesh . &quot;
okay . well , uh , you &apos;ve been very helpful .
the dna recovered from the spear is a match
for the dna found on the victim .
it &apos;s from the same woman .
thank you , susie .
okay , well , that &apos;s a big break .
yep .
it was nice to meet you .
oh , no , no , no , no ,
i &apos;m not finished with your letters .
sit . sit .
have some tea .
have some tea .
&quot; cold are the counsel of women . &quot;
cold , indeed .
find anything on the victim &apos;s computer ?
nothing useful . he jus used it to play m.m.o.s
no idea how he had a successful business .
i guess playing with geirlaug of gongu
is more fun than making beer .
&quot; vikings of the realm &quot; game makers
sent over subscriber information --
12,000 names of people greg jensen played with .
i was about to go through them when jane rescued me .
where is she ?
trapped with professor windbag .
undirmaor and ... gunnhild ?
i can &apos;t find under @-@ girl , but i found the other one .
gunnhild is va @-@ va @-@ va @-@ voom !
her name is kendra dee .
she logs in from her house in south end --
conveniently located just minutes from us .
i &apos;m not doing anything . i could help you pick her up .
yes , that &apos;s my avatar .
can &apos;t you tell ?
yeah . quite the resemblance .
were you having an affair with greg jensen ?
oh , was .
it was the most intensely passionate affair of my life .
we made love on the isle of thanet ,
nottingham , york .
ma &apos;am , was this i.r.l. ?
it was enchanting and magical .
olaf swept me off my feet .
that &apos;s not what i asked .
was it i.r.l. ?
it was not .
what &apos;s &quot; i.r.l. &quot; ?
&quot; in real life . &quot;
ma &apos;am , have you seen this before ?
no , but i can read rune letters .
it &apos;s the name of my lover --
&quot; olaf the boneless . &quot;
did you write these letters to greg jensen ?
to olaf .
it &apos;s a shame he &apos;s dead .
this has to be the work of undirmaor .
she did everything in her power to drive us apart .
do you know who undirmaor is in the , uh ...
the i.r.l. ?
no . i do not .
but mark my words -- i will get that woman .
take my card a @-@ and call me before you do that .
ma &apos;am .
ma &apos;am .
greg jensen was killed i.r.l.
yeah . by an r.p.
&quot; real person . &quot;
it &apos;s jane .
we &apos;d like to do a cheek swab for a dna sample .
if you must .
darn !
who am i gonna play with now ?
oh , my god .
i thought that professor
would never stop talking about underwear .
undirmaor has got mad hacking skills .
keeps changing accounts , deleted her avatar &apos;s history .
well , what do you know ? it &apos;s gunnhild .
she &apos;s cute .
she stopped looking like that in 1963 .
she &apos;s at a secret gaming event .
i &apos;m invited .
well , the dna results haven &apos;t come back yet .
she could be our killer .
she &apos;s says she &apos;s about to make contact with undirmaor .
let &apos;s go .
there &apos;s porgeir .
and there &apos;s thor .
and grettir .
and refur !
&quot; refur &quot; ?
well , i don &apos;t see my date .
speak your preference , viking kin --
raiding , looting , pillaging , slaughtering .
maybe ... erich the blood ax has seen her .
whoa ! your name , wench ?
detective rizzoli , boston homicide .
i &apos;m sorry . w @-@ we &apos;re role @-@ playing .
get it , yeah .
uh , we &apos;re looking for a viking named &quot; gunnhild . &quot;
sure , yeah -- the babe .
she &apos;s in the lower realm .
come on ! you &apos;ve only got one life left .
and i got to go back to the beginning .
oh , crap .
mrs. d ! kendra !
call for backup . we got to lock this place down .
hey , you . you ! hey !
i need all units in the area at solly &apos;s comic store .
did you see anyone come in here ?
uh , no , sir . ma &apos;am . ma &apos;am .
make sure nobody leaves this store , all right ?
go on !
she was stabbed with a dagger --
just like in the game .
who the hell is undirmaor ?
because that &apos;s our killer .
tell me you have something
&apos;cause we don &apos;t have a single witness . ,
well , i found a hair on kendra &apos;s cloak . no root ball .
but we are trying a new forensic laser technique .
it uses ultraviolet light and mass spectrometry .
faster , please .
zaps the hair and turns it into a gas .
explain how that &apos;s gonna help me solve two murders .
it may help us determine what the killer ate and drank
over the last year .
how is knowing how many ding dongs our suspect ate helpful ?
the mass spectrometer results are back on the hair tests .
i know you &apos;ve been waiting for them .
thank you .
because hair grows slowly over time ,
it creates a timeline of sorts .
okay .
so , what did the killer eat --
uh , let me see --
for breakfast in april ?
that &apos;s interesting .
it certainly is .
strawberry waffles ? eggs benedict ?
what ?
fermented minke whale and sheep &apos;s head cheese .
where would you get minke whale
and sheep &apos;s head cheese ,
assuming you &apos;d want it ?
um ... scandinavia ?
scandinavia .
maura , what does &quot; undirmaor &quot; mean ?
in english ?
no . in proto @-@ hobbit .
yes , in english !
&quot; underling &quot; or &quot; apprentice . &quot;
apprentice .
or assistant .
maura , we know someone
who &apos;s probably been eating whale or sheep .
got a warrant . alibi was bullshit .
the airline just confirmed .
ruby burke , greg jensen &apos;s assistant ,
flew standby on an earlier flight from reykjavik .
nice , frost .
okay . thanks .
ruby didn &apos;t show up to work today .
she &apos;s playing &quot; vikings of the realm &quot; somewhere .
so i put a bolo out in the realm ?
no . i built an avatar to find her .
looks just like you .
we got to go in disguise .
i still don &apos;t understand the point of this stupid game .
well , what is so hard about it ?
you raid ships , plunder villages ,
kill sworn enemies to win .
win what ? a fantasy lover ?
wait a minute .
i don &apos;t think this is about winning .
i think this is about love .
you think greg jensen was having a real affair with ruby ?
i don &apos;t know . it wasn &apos;t much of an affair .
there wasn &apos;t any evidence of her at his love nest ,
and the secretions and the seminal fluid
that we found were a month old .
unless jensen had pity sex .
pity sex ?
yeah , one @-@ time pity sex ,
right before he sent ruby to scandinavia .
i mean , he froze her out --
in real life and in the game , too .
so , ruby must have stalked him in the game ,
figured out that he had a new virtual lover ...
&quot; gunnhild , &quot; a.k.a kendra dee .
frost ...
check and see if olaf is online .
olaf ? but greg jensen is dead in the i.r.l.
so explain why olaf is online in his back bay love nest .
not olaf -- undirmaor .
ruby , put your hands in the air .
olaf , my love .
undirmaor . at last -- you &apos;re here .
ru --
she doesn &apos;t even know we &apos;re here .
korsak , unplug that thing .
no .
no ! olaf !
olaf , please come back , my love .
ruby , it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s not over .
we were finally together .
turn it on .
bring him back .
he &apos;s not coming back .
greg is dead , ruby .
i loved him .
he loved me .
did he love ruby burke , or did he love undirmaor ?
he loved me .
me .
olaf loved undirmaor , and i thought ...
oh , god , if only , if only he knew that it was me --
me , ruby , right there all along ...
did you tell him who you were before or after
you slept with him a month ago ?
i gave him my flesh .
and when i told him i was undirmaor , he just ...
he sent me away .
ruby , you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of greg jensen .
no ! no ! please turn it back on !
and kendra dee .
no ! no , he &apos;s not gone !
no , he &apos;s not gone !
he can &apos;t be !
he can &apos;t be gone !
aah ! go right to jail !
my turn . i want to buy me some property .
hope you hid the good silver .
you pretend to be such a badass ,
but you &apos;re really a pushover .
i &apos;m glad you brought them here .
why ? so you could study aberrant juvenile behavior ?
they just need some attention , a little support .
i mean , they &apos;ve never played a board game .
can you believe that ?
i know .
maura , how much garlic did you put on this bread ?
six cloves .
six cl--
they &apos;re homeless teenagers . they &apos;re not vampires .
what about dania ?
well , i &apos;m gonna keep an eye on her .
and so were you .
we &apos;ll make sure she puts that big brain to good use .
i talked to cavanaugh .
the mentor program is now official .
i wanted park place !
oh , too bad , , mrs. vanilla .
hey vanilla .
yeah .
i &apos;m a landlord .
i never pictured an evening in with rondo .
jane
you don &apos;t think your mum might ...
i don &apos;t want to seem uncharitable , but ...
yeah . i &apos;ll make sure that rondo &apos;s reject family
doesn &apos;t move into your guest house .
who &apos;s hungry ?
i &apos;m starving .
me too .
man , this looks good !
it &apos;s hot .
no , no , no . just look , like this .
okay .
