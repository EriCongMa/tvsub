3 women murdered inside a gated community
in southeastern new mexico in the last 2 months .
all 3 inside .
marjorie west was strangled in her home in the middle of the night
while her family was out of town .
they found her the next morning .
jill long was strangled in the laundry room
while her husband and sons were camping in the backyard .
and last night , aubrey jacobs was killed in her home office
while her daughter and husband were asleep in the house .
occupied dwellings is as high @-@ risk as it gets .
and he &apos;s fearless .
proximity , the chance he might get caught--
that could be part of it for him .
you said gated community .
i &apos;m assuming that means security ?
a small security staff and perimeter cameras .
everything &apos;s recorded 24 @-@ 7 , and no one has entered
or left the compound since last night except residents .
it looks like the unsub is part of the community .
the local detective says that demographics , general makeup ,
and socioeconomic status of the residents is essentially the same .
that &apos;s going to make a profile difficult .
unless we examine a different set of parameters .
different parameters ?
rossi &apos;s working on that right now .
what took you so long , cadet ?
what took you so long ? here you go .
the mannequin is your wounded partner .
you and your wounded partner must make it over that wall .
where &apos;s your head at , cadet ? what you thinking ?
let &apos;s move ! let &apos;s move !
use the rope to get your partner over the wall .
let &apos;s move !
use the rope to get your partner over the wall , cadet .
are you paying attention ?
are you thinking with your head ?
get your partner over the wall .
here we go .
move , cadet ! move , cadet !
there you go ! there you go !
watch her . that &apos;s how you do it !
that &apos;s how you do it , cadet !
there you go !
yes ! yes !
that &apos;s about the fastest i &apos;ve ever seen anyone figure that out .
is this the first time she &apos;s ever done that ?
change the task every day .
agent seaver .
sir .
you remember ssa rossi from the behavioral analysis unit ?
of course .
it &apos;s been quite a long time .
yes , sir .
you weren &apos;t easy to find .
you &apos;re supposed to be working the reception desk
at the washington field office .
i &apos;m on my break .
i was told that i could run
the course in my free time if i wanted to .
my concussion--
at ease .
if this is how you want to spend your free time , you have at it .
i &apos;m gonna let the two of you talk . dave .
thanks , bill .
yeah .
i know you &apos;re too busy to just visit .
i want to show you something .
because of my impressive academy scores
or my childhood ?
let &apos;s take a ride .
you remember agent hotchner ?
yes , of course .
good to see you .
hi .
glad to see you &apos;re doing so well .
thank you .
have a seat .
yes , sir .
i told ashley
she may be able to help us with this case .
we have an unsub who manages to live
in close proximity to his victims
without raising an alarm .
that we &apos;ve seen before .
what &apos;s new here is what the local police are telling us
about the community itself .
demographically , everyone &apos;s basically the same .
most of the parameters we would look for to build a profile
seem to exist in most of the men .
but we thought if the unsub has children ,
and the statistics tell us that he probably does ,
would the children exhibit certain specific behavior ?
so this isn &apos;t about my academic scores .
no .
great . give me 15 minutes .
i have a change of clothes in the car .
agent , we &apos;re not detailing you to the unit .
we want to ask you some questions .
right . i see .
do you have some concerns ?
i want to help , and i know that i can .
but i don &apos;t think i can tell you what to look for
without seeing the families myself .
you understand you go only as a consultant on this one case ?
i understand .
and you &apos;re to do nothing
without another member of the team present .
yes , sir .
this won &apos;t be easy , ashley .
it may trigger some extremely painful memories .
i appreciate the concern .
but when your father kills 25 women before you &apos;re a teenager ,
painful memories don &apos;t need a trigger .
they just are .
&quot; when we were children ,
we used to think that when we grew up
we would no longer be vulnerable .
but to grow up is to accept vulnerability .
to be alive is to be vulnerable . &quot;
writer madeleine l &apos;engle .
i &apos;ve notified the primary detective
and the oak tree hills security office of your requirements .
you should know that that security office
is particularly efficient .
except someone &apos;s killing people right under their noses .
call me old @-@ fashioned ,
but that doesn &apos;t seem like efficient security .
yeah . i &apos;m running background checks
on all the male residents , too .
good . and check wider in new mexico
for similar crimes ,
stranglings in occupied dwellings .
wish you , command me .
i shall call you the moment i have anything to contribute
or an overwhelming desire to speak to
my beautiful derek morgan ,
whichever comes first .
let me guess who &apos;ll win .
and you &apos;d be right .
i bid you adieu and safe travels , mon amis .
they called from downstairs . ashley &apos;s on her way up .
have you decided what to tell the team about who she is ?
they &apos;re going to need to know .
but as far as how she wants to tell them ,
i thought we might play that by ear .
i assume since she goes by seaver
that she doesn &apos;t want people knowing who she is .
there she is .
kind of makes you feel old , doesn &apos;t it ?
no .
me neither .
ashley .
agent trainee seaver ,
supervisory special agents prentiss and morgan .
i &apos;ve heard a lot about both of you .
well , i hope it was all good .
very , sir .
anything specific ?
i mean about me in particular .
oh , please , don &apos;t encourage him .
agent seaver is on loan to us from the academy
while she &apos;s in remedial training with an injury .
concussion . hand @-@ to @-@ hand got a little out of control .
how &apos;s the other guy ?
don &apos;t ask .
i was remediated in the academy also .
agent seaver , dr. reid .
um , what was your issue ?
what was my issue ?
marksmanship , physical training ,
obstacle course , hogan &apos;s alley ,
you know , pretty much
everything that wasn &apos;t technically book related .
they ultimately had to make exceptions to allow me into the field .
agent seaver &apos;s going to accompany us to new mexico .
she is ?
as a consultant .
on ?
she has a unique perspective .
they don &apos;t know ?
well , we weren &apos;t sure how you wanted to ,
seaver &apos;s not my original last name .
it &apos;s my mother &apos;s maiden name .
mine used to be beauchamp .
my father is charles beauchamp .
as in the redmond ripper charles beauchamp ?
that &apos;s him .
he killed 25 women over 10 years
in rural north dakota .
i think that you caught him , right , rossi ?
hotch was on that team , too .
based on her life experience ,
we were hoping that agent seaver
might recognize something in the family dynamics
inside the community that could be helpful .
we have a plane waiting .
her father was a serial killer ?
that &apos;s definitely a different set of parameters .
i don &apos;t want her presence to get us sidetracked .
it &apos;s a long shot that she &apos;s gonna see anything helpful .
we work it like any other case .
you got it .
橡树山
i.d. , please .
agent hotchner , fbi .
harvey brinkman , chief of security for the development .
nice to meet you .
detective ruiz is in the model home .
park on the right .
thanks very much .
well , the fact of the matter is ,
&quot; beam me , up , scotty &quot; was never actually said .
the closest they ever got was , &quot; scotty , beam us up &quot;
in &quot; the gamesters of triskelion &quot; and &quot; the savage curtain &quot; episode ,
but interestingly enough
reid , reid , come on . give it a rest .
detective ruiz ?
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m agent hotchner .
call me felix .
these are agents morgan and prentiss .
dr. reid , agent rossi , and agent seaver .
thanks for coming .
as your tech requested , we moved everything
from the station right here into the model home .
thank you .
agent prentiss and i would love to take a look around ,
get a feel for the area .
we &apos;d like to see the latest crime scene , too ,
if that &apos;s possible .
of course . let me just get everybody situated
and i &apos;ll walk you over there .
oh , we can find it .
you sure ?
yeah . it &apos;s no problem .
they sure aren &apos;t the
&quot; mind your own business &quot; types , are they ?
so how come none of them have seen our unsub ?
these are the evidence boards .
as you can see , we &apos;re still in the process of moving in .
i didn &apos;t think the whole neighborhood needed to see the photos .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s a lot of work , detective . thank you .
color @-@ coded and annotated .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not just the primary detective .
i also live in the community .
really ?
3 blocks right up on the left .
my wife thought it would be an excellent place to raise the kids .
she &apos;s changed her opinion in the last couple months .
yeah , i guess so .
you ok ?
yeah . let &apos;s get to work .
i hope you don &apos;t mind ,
but i also worked up a cursory profile .
you did ?
yeah . i took an fbi seminar
on serial crime in albuquerque .
twice .
let &apos;s see what you &apos;ve got so far .
all right .
he &apos;s organized .
he took everything to the scene , he left nothing behind .
which means he lives with a spouse
or some kind of long @-@ term partner .
has a steady , skilled job .
physically , he presents himself as non @-@ threatening ,
but he craves power and control ,
so he may have a job or an activity that gives him that .
not bad .
unfortunately , i just described
64 of the 71 men who live in the subdivision .
and that is the whole kit and kaboodle on each of your 64 suspects .
nothing really stands out . they &apos;re all pretty plain .
that &apos;s pretty much the main issue we &apos;re going to have here .
yeah . vanilla doesn &apos;t make your job any easier .
no , it does not .
so , um , how &apos;s it going with the agent whose father was a ...
you know ?
how &apos;d you know that ?
i might have looked into someone &apos;s hidden background .
what ? i am not gonna let some strange new person
travel with my family and not find out who they are .
well , she seems fine .
what is that in your voice ?
what &apos;s what in my voice ?
oh , my god , you think she &apos;s pretty .
what ? i never said that .
ho ho , you totally do .
ha ha ! p.g. out , lover boy .
what &apos;s all that ?
our technical analyst ran background checks on the suspects .
oh , i could have given you that .
we typically gather our own intelligence .
out federal databases tend to have more detailed information .
well , how do you know
they &apos;re more detailed if you haven &apos;t seen ours ?
it &apos;s nothing personal , chief .
it &apos;s just ...
you could have asked .
next time i will .
has anyone vetted them ?
garcia &apos;s doing a separate check
on police and security staff .
why ?
law enforcement and security
are the kind of jobs that would attract this unsub .
dennis rader , btk , was a compliance officer
in park city , kansas .
kenneth bianchi , one of the hillside stranglers ,
worked as a security guard in california and washington .
psychopaths love official jobs
and uniforms .
where were you the night of the 12th ?
are you saying you think this was me ?
answer the question !
are you kidding me ?
you interviewed every adult male in the community ?
more than once . they &apos;re all digitized .
were all the interviews confrontational like this ?
is that wrong ?
you didn &apos;t get much out of them , did you ?
no .
that &apos;s when i started thinking maybe i needed some help .
they don &apos;t have anything ?
after the second woman was killed ,
detective ruiz said they had evidence .
the police are doing everything they can .
and now you &apos;re telling me you have nothing ?
you have no idea who did this ?
i don &apos;t understand how something like this could happen
and no one heard or saw anything .
it &apos;s because the kind of person who does this
spends their life practicing .
and what they &apos;re good at is getting away with it .
yeah , well , aubrey never hurt anybody in her whole life .
i wish i had answers for you .
it &apos;s my--my daughter .
i gotta get her out of here .
everywhere she looks ...
where is she now ?
she &apos;s in her room .
do you need to talk to her ?
no . that &apos;s all right .
sir , the unsub came through the garage ?
yeah . detective ruiz said the remote openers
in this compound only have 5 unique codes .
well , you &apos;d think they would tell you that
when you moved in , right ?
anyone could just drive around
and open up a fifth of the garage doors .
i usually make sure all the inside doors are locked up ,
but aubrey stayed up late and ...
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
daddy ?
um , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s my daughter .
can i ...
yes , of course .
thanks .
all that stuff you said about btk and the hillside strangler ,
it &apos;s all in your head ?
i have an eidetic memory .
so you know everything my dad did , then .
i only know what i was told
and what was in the papers .
i don &apos;t have a lot of details .
uh , what sort of details--
agent seaver .
there &apos;s going to be a community meeting tonight .
we &apos;re going to all look for visual cues ,
but i want you specifically to concentrate on family interactions .
yes , sir .
chief . we need to have a place
to hold a town meeting .
well , there &apos;s a church on the east side of the development .
will you have your men notify residents
that there &apos;ll be a meeting there tonight ?
stress that it &apos;s important but not compulsory .
yeah .
thank you .
6 p.m.
agent hotchner .
sir .
you should see this .
this guy &apos;s frank morris .
i do ? how do i know that ?
i run the damn neighborhood watch .
that means you &apos;re walking around at night .
now , the profile could include somebody
in the neighborhood watch , right ?
it could . we &apos;d have to know more about his activities .
exactly . i &apos;ll have him brought in .
we &apos;re going to try something else .
can you make some officers available to run a sign @-@ in table
at a community meeting tonight ?
one of the things we &apos;re going to be examining
is body language in a group environment .
body language .
it &apos;s something that the unsub
won &apos;t be able to control
even if he were to try to .
right . right .
i &apos;ll have some uniforms detailed to the meeting .
will you also tell brinkman that the unsub
will display something that he can &apos;t control .
ok .
you think they &apos;ll be able to keep that to themselves ?
let &apos;s hope not .
looks like she was writing a story or something .
yeah , her husband said she was taking classes .
she wanted to be a novelist .
i want to get this over to garcia so she can do her thing .
man , this job .
what we see , all these lives cut short .
i know , prentiss .
i was just thinking about you .
baby girl , listen . we got a laptop here
that was owned by the last victim .
i &apos;m gonna hook it up for you over at the model home
so you can work your magic , all right ?
what kind of magic ?
well , she was a writer , so maybe she kept a journal ?
maybe she noticed somebody following her
or just felt something weird , i don &apos;t know .
so we &apos;re fishing .
yep . fish away .
ok . i just so happen to have
a pair of chartreuse waders i never get to wear .
oh , and , garcia ,
the suspects who are left ,
see if any of them have a tech background ,
enough that they would know
how to modify a remote garage door opener .
done , love you , ciao .
modify a remote ?
marjorie west &apos;s family was out of town .
jill long was strangled in her laundry room
while her family was camping outside .
and right here the unsub &apos;s able to get through the entire house
only to find a room where somebody was awake ?
does that sound like somebody just randomly checking garage doors
to see if the fifth one will open ?
no . that sounds like someone who can open the garage
he specifically needs opened .
prentiss .
we &apos;ll be right there .
rossi wants us at the church .
they &apos;re setting up a community meeting .
let &apos;s go .
we just came from the last victim &apos;s house .
the unsub used the garage as access .
maybe a remote door opener made to be universal .
the police are saying it &apos;s random ,
but how could you randomly find a woman so vulnerable ?
garcia &apos;s going over backgrounds again ,
trying to highlight anyone with tech experience .
she &apos;s also doing a full workup on brinkman and ruiz .
they had that kind of access .
has anyone seen ruiz ?
i saw him a while ago .
he set up everyone filling out forms ,
but i haven &apos;t seen him since .
we need to ask for help in a different way .
tell people that we &apos;re looking
for someone who might have seen something
rather than someone who did something .
no one thinks that their friends or neighbors are capable of this .
we should get started .
we &apos;re hoping that someone may have seen something
and not even realized it .
maybe you have a neighbor who takes his trash out late ,
works on his car in his garage .
anything that might put someone outside
at an odd hour
and giving them the opportunity to see something .
is there anything we can help you look for ?
it won &apos;t be overt .
the kids probably won &apos;t be afraid of dad .
they won &apos;t ? these guys have explosive tempers , don &apos;t they ?
definitely .
anger wasn &apos;t normal at my house .
usually when it happened , when it exploded ,
it was an anomaly . a surprise .
if anything , my father was overly solicitous .
too nice .
and if i wanted anything ...
bicycles , toys , dolls ...
all i had to do was ask .
in groups , he always held my hand .
always .
sometimes so tight ,
it almost cut off the circulation .
but i can never remember him putting me on his lap ,
holding me in any way .
ashley .
and ...
he &apos;d always have these talks with me .
he was terrified someone would take me .
because he knew what was out there .
yeah , men like him .
you know , maybe this man recently bought gifts for his kids .
my dad used to buy me things all the time .
what kinds of gifts ?
anything .
everything .
i told you , there was nothing ...
my whole life ,
there &apos;s only one thing i wanted that i couldn &apos;t have .
which was ?
a pet .
what have we got ?
we &apos;re gonna start with the people who didn &apos;t show ,
cross @-@ reference with families with no pets .
no pets ?
i remembered i wasn &apos;t allowed to have a dog
or a pet of any kind .
it was more than a rule .
it was a big problem for us .
that could be something .
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t point him out .
we don &apos;t expect you to point him out .
we &apos;re hoping you can help us once we have things narrowed down .
guys , of the 64 suspects , 18 of them didn &apos;t show up .
ok . prentiss , take ashley back to the model home ,
go through the 18 names and add the pet information .
i got it .
garcia &apos;s working on technical backgrounds ?
yes .
ok , let &apos;s get her the 18 names .
and ruiz never got here ?
no . neither did the security chief .
ok , as far as i &apos;m concerned , we have 20 no @-@ shows .
that was good stuff
back there , what you said .
that was helpful .
was it ?
yeah .
profiling is a process .
it &apos;s about puzzle pieces ,
things that don &apos;t look like they fit until they do .
i still don &apos;t know how anything i said will be helpful .
well , you never know .
if we have a subject in interrogation ,
knowing that he &apos;s a father
who &apos;s a serial killer who might be overprotective ,
that could be the perfect way to get him to talk .
the truth is , i ...
i never actually thought about them being fathers at all .
i don &apos;t think anyone does .
is he still alive , your father ?
north dakota does not have the death penalty .
and the answer to your next questions is no ,
i have never been to see him .
he writes from time to time , but ...
i haven &apos;t opened any of the letters .
do you keep them ?
yes .
is that wrong ?
i don &apos;t think there is any right or wrong
when it comes to that .
can i ask you a question ?
sure .
when you catch them ,
do they ever say why ?
do they have an explanation ?
never a good one .
agent hotchner ?
yes , sir .
detective ruiz would like you to meet him at main and oak .
there &apos;s been another murder .
ok , let &apos;s hope the occupancy listings show pets .
this is the pile of suspects we need to weed the 18 from .
what are these ?
victim information , of the families of the 3 women who were killed .
families .
yeah , families are the hardest part about this job .
drew jacobs . we talked to him this afternoon .
his wife aubrey was victim number 3 .
she &apos;s never going to have a mother around .
no .
that was her laptop .
garcia , our tech , she ran a remote data sweep of it .
we &apos;re gonna have to take it back to the house .
meeting over ?
relax . it &apos;s just me .
how &apos;d the meeting go ?
we missed you there .
well , i thought it would be a good time for a sweep , you know ,
while everyone was busy .
what are you girls looking for ?
whether or not any of the no @-@ shows have pets .
pets ? those reports aren &apos;t gonna show that .
no ?
but i can find out for you .
got all that information in the security office
at the gate on the south end .
i &apos;ll show you .
i &apos;ll be back .
i know , mike . i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;re doing everything we can .
the unsub &apos;s killed 2 nights in a row .
it &apos;s a major escalation .
we need to start over .
what do you mean ?
i think we go back to the beginning .
local p.d. gave us a list of 64 out of the 71 possible males .
i think we throw that out and start with the original 71 .
what about ruiz ?
he &apos;s definitely on the list .
pets , pets , pets .
i know they &apos;re in here somewhere .
maybe i should take a look .
relax .
why you gotta be in such a hurry ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re trying to catch a killer .
yeah .
here it is .
wait .
yes ?
how hard is the background check to get into the fbi ?
i got arrested once . it was supposed to be expunged ,
but it wasn &apos;t .
it was really all just a big misunderstanding .
oh , well , you know , if it was a misunderstanding ...
really ?
no .
hi . mr. jacobs ?
go finish getting ready , heather . it &apos;s ok .
my name is agent seaver .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
well , there were agents here already .
i know .
i brought your wife &apos;s computer back .
thank you .
sir , the bau is going to find the man that hurt your wife .
and when they do , you &apos;ll probably learn that he has a family .
i &apos;m sorry ?
a lot of craziness is going to go on all at once
and the family won &apos;t be able to tell you .
they &apos;ll be afraid . they won &apos;t know how to approach you .
but they &apos;ll be very sorry .
they &apos;ll wish they could have done something to stop him .
they &apos;ll wish things could be different .
they would do anything for things to be different .
i just want to apologize for them .
would you like to come in ?
no , i should get back .
it would just be for a minute .
heather , my daughter , she &apos;s afraid .
it might make her feel better
knowing there &apos;s an fbi agent here .
ok .
just for a minute .
hey , reid ,
where &apos;s the list of people that didn &apos;t make the meeting ?
right here .
we need to look at all 71 files .
we need to eliminate suspects our way , not theirs .
garcia , i got you ?
fingers at the ready .
what &apos;s up ?
there are only 67 files here .
where are the other 4 ?
well , one of them &apos;s me .
and the other 3 are the victims &apos; husbands .
why would they automatically be cleared ?
wouldn &apos;t they ? i mean , if you &apos;re gonna check them ,
you might as well check me .
we are .
detective , where are the missing files ?
right over there .
garcia , we need you to run a few more names .
phillip long .
long has no suspicions on his record , no arrests ,
and no technology either .
drew jacobs .
this is a really beautiful room .
i don &apos;t want to move again .
i know .
but i also know that your father
is doing what he thinks is best for you .
are you gonna shoot him ?
excuse me ?
the guy who hurt my mom .
do you have a gun ?
heather .
no , it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m sorry .
not a problem .
really .
here .
thank you , but i really should be getting back .
can i ask you something ?
of course .
how do you know what the killer &apos;s family is thinking ?
you said they &apos;ll want to apologize ?
they will .
they &apos;ll be embarrassed
and ashamed ...
and really sorry .
but how do you know that ?
drew jacobs has a couple arrests for assault
when he was younger .
i &apos;ll give you more details on that in a sec .
is this the husband of the woman
whose computer i went through ?
she was really unhappy with him .
she said he was distant , he left her alone at night .
yeah . wandering around outside .
outside ?
as a matter of fact , before his wife was killed ,
he was my top suspect .
how do you ...
know ... how the killer &apos;s family will feel ?
we study it in the fbi ,
behavior .
we &apos;ve conducted interviews .
of killers &apos; families ?
sometimes .
why would you do that ?
wait , wait . he &apos;s an i.t expert
who travels around the world .
he &apos;s a tech .
all right , thanks , baby girl .
what &apos;s going on ?
there was another murder .
what ?
during the meeting .
where &apos;s seaver ?
i -- i really need to be getting back out there .
i know , i know . it &apos;s just --
this is important to me .
how do you know ?
how do you know what his family will think ?
i have to get that .
no . - yes , i --
no .
yes , i have to .
it &apos;s my team .
agent seaver .
ashley , where are you ?
without a doubt , sir .
where are you ?
yes , sir .
can you get out of there ?
ashley .
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
i , uh , i can &apos;t do that .
mr. jacobs told me that his daughter was frightened ,
and as soon as i can make her feel better ,
i &apos;ll come back .
jacobs has her . she has no gun . let &apos;s go .
son of a bitch .
that was my boss . he &apos;s kind of a pain .
hmm . what did he want ?
he &apos;s always checking up on me .
daddy , no !
look , mr . jacobs , wait , no--
ok .
shut up !
please ...
please , don &apos;t make her watch .
what ?
your daughter .
you never let her see you angry , right ?
please , don &apos;t let her see this .
she will never forget it , mr . jacobs .
if you let her see this ,
she will never forgive you .
heather , go downstairs .
i don &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s time to go , heather .
you don &apos;t have to do this , mr . jacobs .
i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time ...
how do you know what the families will think ?
my father was like you .
well , what ?
he killed a lot of women before i was a teenager .
his name was charles beauchamp
and they called him the redmond ripper .
your father ?
he was like you .
he was a serial killer .
daddy ?
daddy , please .
i know how tired you are .
i know how exhausting your life is .
i watched him live it .
i watched him fight it .
and i saw how desperately he wanted to be different .
prentiss and morgan , take the back .
make noise . let him know he &apos;s caught .
it may be the only chance she &apos;s got .
i watched him try so hard to be a good father .
but in the end ,
he just couldn &apos;t stop the other thing .
fbi ! fbi !
daddy , please , let &apos;s just leave .
go downstairs , heather .
please , daddy .
fbi !
fbi !
my father once told me ...
the best day of his life
was the day he got arrested ,
because he could finally stop .
do you hate him ?
drop the knife .
daddy !
drop the knife !
daddy !
i &apos;m sorry , baby .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you were not supposed to go off on your own .
i know .
you could have been killed .
i know that , too .
why , ashley ?
you &apos;re smarter than that .
i never got to apologize to any of the victims .
the families of the women my father killed .
i thought if i could just apologize to one family
that had been hurt that way ...
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s not good enough .
by making that choice , you put everyone at risk .
when you &apos;re in the field ,
we are responsible to and for each other .
we are a team .
i won &apos;t do it again .
no , you won &apos;t .
what else is on your mind ?
a dog .
when i was 7 years old ,
i found a puppy on my way home from school .
i ran all the way home with this little ball of fur .
i was so excited .
and when i got to the house ,
my dad was the only one home .
and i gave him the puppy to hold while i got him some milk .
we didn &apos;t have dog food , but i thought , well ,
a puppy &apos;s like a baby , so milk , right ?
and when i got back ...
my dad was in the bathroom ...
and he turned and told me to put the milk away .
i didn &apos;t understand .
and he told me we didn &apos;t need the hassle of another mouth to feed
and i was never to do that again .
he tilted his head .
i started crying and i could swear he looked like he was having fun .
he &apos;s a psychopath .
cruelty to animals is part of that .
i know .
but what i don &apos;t understand ...
mr. jacobs asked me a question about my father , and ...
i don &apos;t hate him .
i don &apos;t .
i try , but i just don &apos;t .
no matter what else he is ,
he &apos;s your father .
now , you &apos;re not responsible
for the things he did .
but you can &apos;t change the fact that to you ...
he &apos;s still your dad .
i just feel like he &apos;s winning if i don &apos;t hate him .
no , kiddo ...
there &apos;s no winning .
there &apos;s just ...
living .
moving forward .
and if you keep doing that ...
you &apos;ll be all right .
is that true ?
it is for me .
thank you .
&quot; children begin by loving their parents .
&quot; as they grow older , they judge them .
sometimes they forgive them . &quot;
