第三季 第十五集
&lt; i &gt; the scavos prepared for a grand opening . &lt; i &gt;
this could be the best thing that ever happen to our family .
&lt; i &gt; while gabrielle had a few too many drinks . &lt; i &gt;
i &apos;m gonna take a little nap , ok ?
&lt; i &gt; and a cry for help made orson lose his cool . &lt; i &gt;
suicide is the worst thing that can happen to a family !
&lt; i &gt; mike got arrested . &lt; i &gt;
oh , thank god .
&lt; i &gt; and a friendship hit the rocks . &lt; i &gt;
for the sake of our friendship ...
make no mistake . our friendship is over .
&lt; i &gt; orson &apos;s mom was determined ... &lt; i &gt;
in the eyes of god , you &apos;re the other woman .
&lt; i &gt; ... to bring alma and orson back together . &lt; i &gt;
she raped you , and your mother helped .
i think it &apos;s time i told you about the night monique died .
&lt; i &gt; alma became a prisoner . &lt; i &gt;
gloria ?
&lt; i &gt; bree was set up to take a fall . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and mike was finally able to remember the past . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; orson hodge had always assumed &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that the moment before he died , &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; his entire life would flash before his eyes . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but as he fell &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; from the roof of the fairview memorial hospital , &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it wasn &apos;t his life he saw . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it was one night in particular . &lt; i &gt;
monique .
i have wonderful news . bonnes nouvelles .
monique .
there &apos;s been an accident .
oh , my god .
what have you done ?
it was self @-@ defense .
i came to tell her to stay away from you . she attacked me .
mother ... she &apos;s dead .
i know .
and i &apos;m sorry . but what &apos;s done is done .
what are you doing ?
calling the police .
no , i &apos;ll go to jail .
you killed someone .
i &apos;m your mother . you &apos;ve got to help me .
but i loved her .
i once lost someone i loved , thanks to you .
you owe me .
hello ?
miss polier ?
i &apos;ve got that part for the sink .
hello ?
miss polier ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m monique &apos;s boyfriend .
she &apos;s upstairs lying down . she wasn &apos;t feeling well .
i &apos;ll finish up the sink and get out of your hair .
why don &apos;t you let me take care of that ?
i mean , i &apos;m pretty handy and it &apos;s getting late .
i don &apos;t mind staying .
no , i &apos;ve got it under control .
here , let me , uh ... let me pay you .
that should cover it .
thanks .
oh , hey , don &apos;t forget your wrench .
you handled that very well , son .
now help me find a tarp .
what are you doing ?
you don &apos;t want her identified through dental record , do you ?
i must say , i never realized your job was so difficult .
it &apos;s not enough to kill her ?
you have to desecrate her body , too ?
get away from her !
now look what you &apos;ve done .
i think my damn hip &apos;s broken .
help me .
&lt; i &gt; yes , orson hodge had always assumed &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that his life would flash &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; before his eyes the moment before he died . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; luckily for orson ... &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... that moment ... &lt; i &gt;
i got a pulse . let &apos;s get him inside .
get a backboard and a collar .
&lt; i &gt; ... was not scheduled for today . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the first light of sunrise . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the sound of a cat purring . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the smell of fresh coffee . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; yes , there are many things a housewife likes to wake up to . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but an unexpected guest in her bed is not one of them . &lt; i &gt;
zach ?
you &apos;re in your underwear .
well , i needed to put on something to get the morning paper .
you &apos;ve been here all night ?
sure .
i &apos;m not one of those guys who gets up and leaves right after .
right after what ?
do you wanna hear me say it ?
fine . you were amazing .
ok , listen to me very carefully .
and this is no time to be vague .
what exactly was i amazing at ?
please tell me that once contained a mint .
after a few drinks , you told me how lonely you were ,
i was the kindest man you &apos;d met in a few years ,
and then you kissed me . and then you took off your
ok , ok , stop talking . i &apos;m getting nauseous .
this is so great . i have so many awesome plans for us .
us . oh , man , it feels so good to say that .
oh , god , here it comes .
would you like me to hold your hair , honey ?
no !
hey . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m lying in bed ,
thinking about the opening tonight , when it hits me .
we could run out of bread sticks .
oh , honey .
you have had , what , four hours
sleep in the past three days ? you need rest .
who cares if we run out of bread sticks ?
i do .
tonight &apos;s the most important night of my life .
everything &apos;s gotta be perfect .
here . try that .
it &apos;s good .
no . too salty .
if they &apos;re salty , we &apos;ll sell more beer . see ? you &apos;re a genius .
don &apos;t patronize me . oh , my god . this is gonna be a disaster .
hey , chill out .
you &apos;re acting like i did when i was six months pregnant .
excuse me . you were hitting people .
only two .
and the mailman had the good taste never bring that again .
come on , let &apos;s go get some sleep .
the doughmaker has to be fixed .
the chairs get delivered at noon .
i know . i &apos;m the one that put in the order .
i will handle anything that needs to be done .
and you take these and get some sleep .
we need you at your best tonight .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m crazy .
honey glaze . honey glaze will cut the salt in the bread sticks .
tom , i do not need to be pregnant to kick your ass .
now go . go on .
andrew , you &apos;re here .
what happened to me ?
you kind of had an accident .
you fell off our ladder .
oh , that &apos;s right . is orson here ?
he &apos;s at the hospital , but he &apos;s not exactly visiting .
suicide ? no . orson would never try to kill himself .
the police are wrong . it must have been an accident .
but they found his footprints on the trunk of his car .
the only reason he &apos;d be up there is to jump .
but why ?
maybe he was feeling guilty .
for what ?
mom , i looked at that ladder .
someone sawed through the rung .
and you think ...
i heard you two the other day .
you told him to turn himself in or else .
the next day you fall and nearly die .
you think that &apos;s a coincidence ?
you say he &apos;s just down the hall ?
yeah , but don &apos;t worry .
i told them not to let him near you .
and we &apos;re gonna get you home as soon as we can .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m here to pick up my wife &apos;s belongings .
jane hainsworth .
oh . yes . i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
i &apos;ll be right back .
are you doing ok ?
not really . but having you here helps .
oh . hey , mrs. mayer .
andrew , what are you doing at the hospital ?
you haven &apos;t heard ?
susan .
i just heard from andrew what happened .
i had to come see you .
if you want me to go , i ...
no , no . come in .
i know we &apos;ve been fighting ,
but something like this happens ,
it puts everything into perspective .
i am so sorry .
it was all my fault .
if i hadn &apos;t got so caught up in protecting mike ...
susan , stop .
mike is innocent .
he had nothing to do with monique polier &apos;s murder .
do you know something ?
yes .
and i intend to go to the police .
oh , my god .
does this have something to do with orson &apos;s accident ?
i can &apos;t tell you right now .
you &apos;re just gonna have to trust me . can you do that ?
of course .
i should let you rest .
so we &apos;re back to being friends ?
we never really stopped .
um , excuse me . these things don &apos;t belong to jane .
are you sure ?
every couple has their secrets ,
but i &apos;m sure she wasn &apos;t a closet whittler .
mike delfino .
these are mike &apos;s things ?
yep . someone made a big mistake .
helen , you screwed up the labels again .
oh ! he had an engagement ring with him . that &apos;s pretty .
you know , mike and i are good friends .
i could return these things to him , if you like .
sorry . he &apos;ll have to pick them up himself .
it &apos;s hospital policy .
it &apos;s also hospital policy
to put the right labels on the right boxes .
ian , you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
bree told me she can prove mike &apos;s innocent .
what ?
it &apos;s true . he &apos;s gonna be a free man .
isn &apos;t that great ?
yes , it &apos;s bloody fantastic .
here . i &apos;m gonna go get bree some flowers . i &apos;ll be right back .
no , no , that &apos;s great news .
thank you , doctor .
so , uh , orson &apos;s gonna pull through ?
you &apos;d rather he didn &apos;t ?
no . i just don &apos;t know
what he &apos;s gonna tell the police when he wakes up .
wasn &apos;t your fault .
orson falling off that roof was an accident , right ?
well , sort of .
sort of ?
depending on what orson tells them ,
i could get charged with attempted murder .
i &apos;m so glad she has you to take care of her ,
and , of course , your mom comes first , andrew .
and i wouldn &apos;t even ask except ,
you know , we &apos;re opening tonight ...
chairs are here .
oh , god , seriously ?
fantastic , thank you .
it &apos;s just two quick hours ,
and then we &apos;ll get you right back home with your mom .
thank you , andrew .
ok , bye @-@ bye .
did you finish folding the takeout menus ?
you never asked me to do that .
i shouldn &apos;t have to tell you every little thing , you know .
show some initiative .
wait . where are my chairs ? i didn &apos;t order these .
you lynette scavo ?
yes .
well then , you ordered these .
no . why would i order 50 high chairs
for the opening of a pizzeria ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought it was one of those kiddy pizza places ,
with the games and the animatronic rats .
give me that .
easy there , sally
animatronics rats . where do they find you people ?
okay , okay , here it is . see ?
i ordered 50 of item number 7 @-@ 3 ...
did we find the mistake ?
i , um , switched the seven and the one .
so we &apos;re both wrong .
now , this place opens in five hours .
how long will it take to fix this ?
hi . i need to rent 50 chairs by tonight at five .
what ? why not ?
what do you mean , it &apos;s bar mitzvah season ?
there &apos;s no such thing .
you still have five ? i will take those . scavo .
ok . that brings us to 22 .
javi , rico , we got chairs to find . move it .
looks like someone crawled into
a bottle of merlot last night .
sort of threw myself a little birthday party .
so , if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to get back to my dry heaving .
quick question .
was that zach young i saw leaving your house
at eight this morning ?
oh . yeah . um , he just came by to , uh ,
drop off a birthday card .
really cute , little cat with balloons .
all right , bye .
follow @-@ up .
why was zach in your driveway at seven this morning ,
in his underwear ?
we had sex last night .
what ?
i mean , i think we did .
that &apos;s what he told me .
weren &apos;t you there ?
i don &apos;t remember anything .
i just woke up and he was in bed next to me .
thanks again , gaby . hey , carlos .
if you don &apos;t remember ,
then how can you be sure that you and zach had sex ?
well , we were both half @-@ naked ,
and there was a condom wrapper ,
and he said i was amazing , which totally sounds like me .
he thinks we &apos;re a couple now . you have to help me .
i am not getting involved .
god , i can &apos;t believe you bagged another neighborhood kid .
where are you going ?
to warn the scavo boys .
i wanna speak to my wife .
she &apos;s resting .
if we can get back to these questions ...
i fell off a roof .
i need a physician , not a psychiatrist .
well , i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s hospital policy
when there &apos;s a suspected suicide attempt .
i didn &apos;t try to kill myself .
but you do have a certain history .
you spent most of 1976 in a psychiatric hospital .
i don &apos;t care to discuss that .
you won &apos;t be leaving here until we do .
my parents were very religious .
when i was 16 , my father had an affair .
caused quite a scandal at our church .
he became depressed . he started drinking heavily .
my mother grew concerned .
she didn &apos;t like leaving him alone .
one night she had to visit a sick friend
and asked me to keep an eye on him ,
but i &apos;d made plans with friends .
i thought i could duck out for a while .
when i got home , i found him in the bathroom .
you blamed yourself ?
i didn &apos;t need to .
mother blamed me enough for both of us .
that must have caused quite a strain in your relationship .
yes .
but now and then she suggests little ways
i might make it up to her .
yes , i &apos;m calling to check on the status of a patient .
last name hodge .
what do you mean , which hodge ?
gloria , thank god .
i thought you &apos;d forgotten about me .
when are you letting me out of here ?
it won &apos;t be long now .
in fact , something interesting happened last night .
orson tried to kill himself .
oh , my goodness . is he ok ?
he &apos;ll be fine .
my point is ,
suicide is hardly the act of a happily married man .
gloria , for god &apos;s sake ,
give it up .
he doesn &apos;t love me .
he will , dear .
bree will be gone soon ,
and he &apos;ll need a good woman like you to console him .
what are you gonna do to bree ?
gloria ? gloria !
oh , hey , hon . did you get some sleep ?
yes . i &apos;m still kinda groggy from those pills ,
but ...
and now i &apos;m awake .
ok , little mix @-@ up with the new chairs .
which you were in charge of .
ok , ok , we could point fingers .
but what &apos;s important is forgetting about what we expected ,
and focusing on what we have , which isn &apos;t so bad .
i mean , all the different kinds of chairs
give the place a kind of bohemian vibe .
plus , if we get a lot of babies ,
look , we &apos;re just totally set .
tom , i &apos;m sorry . i am . i &apos;m sorry .
i just ... i realize it &apos;s not perfect .
but ... please say something .
what can i say , lynette ?
it is what it is .
why do i have to baby @-@ sit mom ?
all my friends are gonna be at the opening .
austin was gonna sneak us beer .
damn it , danielle , i have to work .
our mother &apos;s lying helpless upstairs
&apos;cause her husband tried to kill her .
for just one night , could you try to be responsible ?
i liked you better when you were a psychopath !
here you go .
oh . you &apos;re here .
i wouldn &apos;t have missed it .
you know how i feel about lynette and tom .
uh , look . zach , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
i &apos;ve been wanting to talk , about us .
me too . you being in my life now ,
having the connection that we do ,
this is really the first time
i &apos;ve been happy since my mother killed herself .
could you excuse me a second ?
of course , baby . hurry back .
i am in hell . i just tried to break up with zach .
the little twerp played the dead mommy card .
can &apos;t let him make you feel guilty .
but i am guilty .
i don &apos;t remember how we ended up in bed together .
maybe i led him on .
i &apos;ve got to be sensitive here .
could you threaten him for me ?
what ?
you know , intimidate him .
do the whole jealous , latin , ex @-@ husband thing you do .
tell him if you can &apos;t have me , nobody can .
forget it . i &apos;m not gonna do that to poor zach .
hey , i am looking out for zach , too .
if i dump him , it &apos;ll destroy him emotionally .
better to scare him off .
please ?
fine .
thank you .
ok , look , there he goes .
go . go get all cholo on his ass .
hey , mr. solis .
look , i need to talk to you about something .
it &apos;s a little awkward , but ...
mr. solis ?
what ?
you were just saying that something was awkward ?
never mind . forget that i said anything .
hey . so how &apos;d it go ?
you did not have sex with zach young .
really ? did he tell you that ?
he didn &apos;t have to .
what ?
i was standing next to him at the urinal .
i don &apos;t care how drunk you were ,
if you had sex with him , you &apos;d remember .
little zach young ?
well , just how much would i have remembered ?
uh , hey . what are you doing here ?
i thought bree might like some soup .
it &apos;s my own special recipe .
i was surprised to find you home .
i thought the whole street was going to scavo &apos;s tonight .
well , i was supposed to go .
but , uh , andrew said i had to stay home and baby @-@ sit mom .
well , that &apos;s just silly .
a vibrant young lady like you should be at the party ,
turning boys &apos; heads .
you go . i &apos;ll look after your mother .
you mean it ?
just take her dinner up first .
i don &apos;t think i can manage the tray with my cane .
thanks , grandma . you &apos;re the best .
this soup smells so good .
you wanna score some points , don &apos;t say i brought it .
tell her you made it yourself .
hello ! over here !
honey , there is a line out the door .
we are gonna make a killing tonight .
i &apos;m happy for you .
for us .
now it &apos;s us ?
because i thought i was the one
who was trying to ruin everything .
ok , look , i know i overreacted ...
yes , you did , but ... i have customers .
place came out great , huh ?
sure did .
looks like the whole street &apos;s here .
yeah .
except for orson , who fell off a roof .
you know anything about that ?
why would you think that ?
i heard you talking to carlos .
answer the question .
i ... i can &apos;t talk about it here .
it &apos;s complicated .
it always is with you .
hey , i just had a slice of pizza . it &apos;s pretty good .
is it really good ,
or are you just pretending you had a slice ?
you and i did not have sex . admit it .
of course we did .
zach , how can you claim to care about me
and lie to my face ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m tired of just being your friend .
i thought if you saw me as a lover ,
you could think of me as a man , not a boy .
zach , a real man is honest .
all you &apos;ve tried to do is bribe
and trick me into falling in love with you .
a little advice next time ? don &apos;t play games .
just stand up and be the kind of man
a woman would be proud to share her life with .
hello !
i think it &apos;s high time to make a toast .
sure .
um , tom , where are you ? where ... ?
tom , you did it .
there are a lot of people in this room
that didn &apos;t think you could pull it off .
ok , well , maybe just me .
anyway , congratulations .
the pizza is excellent , and the service is sublime .
cheers .
speech !
thank you . thank you for coming .
it means everything in the world to me .
i gotta tell you , when i arrived here this afternoon
i saw these weird chairs ,
i thought the evening was gonna be a total disaster .
but now , when i look out ,
i can &apos;t even see the chairs .
i just see people eating , laughing ,
and having a great time .
it &apos;s absolutely perfect .
and none of this would have happened
without my amazing partner lynette .
who , uh ... to ...
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m a little ...
i think what my husband is trying to say is ,
if you wanna test a marriage ,
open a restaurant together .
anyway , um , thank you for coming .
eat a lot and come back .
&apos;cause our kids need braces .
actually , as long as everyone has their glasses raised ,
i have something that i would like to say .
i ... well , i thought of waiting for the perfect romantic spot
to ask this question ,
but being here tonight ,
enveloped by so much love and warmth ,
i realize that , um , this is the perfect romantic spot .
susan mayer ...
drop the pizza .
will you make me the happiest man in the world
and be my wife ?
absolutely . yes .
ladies and gentlemen , please .
i have something that i &apos;d like to say also .
gabrielle solis , will you marry me ?
no , there will be no clapping .
you . moron . come with me .
time for your pills , mr. hodge .
it &apos;s after six ? i need to speak with my wife .
what room is she in ?
oh . your wife checked out .
already ?
she was very eager to get home .
don &apos;t worry . she &apos;ll be fine .
i have to talk to her .
oh . that reminds me , your mother called .
she said she didn &apos;t wanna wake you up .
she wanted to make sure we &apos;d be keeping you overnight .
moms are like that , so protective .
&lt; i &gt; bree , it &apos;s me . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; are you there ? please pick up . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; bree ? &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; please , somebody , pick up the phone . &lt; / i &gt;
i know you &apos;re mad ...
i &apos;m not mad , zach , i &apos;m done .
you said to be honest .
i did not say to humiliate me .
i &apos;m sorry . all right , i was just trying to ...
what do you want from me ?
i want you to leave me alone .
this friends thing isn &apos;t gonna work .
you &apos;ll always want more .
and i &apos;m never gonna love you . ever .
twenty years from now ,
when you &apos;re all middle @-@ aged and alone ,
you &apos;ll regret this .
ok . i &apos;ll take my chances .
thought you might need this .
bless you .
so how did it go with seabiscuit ?
he &apos;s devastated .
of course .
it &apos;s my fault .
i should have known he couldn &apos;t handle
the whole &quot; let &apos;s be friends &quot; thing .
i don &apos;t blame him .
i &apos;m having kind of a hard time myself being just your friend .
watching you with other guys , being your confidant .
really ? i think it &apos;s been nice .
for you maybe .
seriously , i don &apos;t know how much longer
i &apos;m gonna be able to keep this up .
well , hang in there as long as you can
because i still need you .
i &apos;ll do my best .
what are you doing here ?
i have better things to do than baby @-@ sit mom .
she &apos;s fine . gloria &apos;s watching her .
what ? i told you mom &apos;s ready
to go to the cops about orson .
how could you leave her at home with his crazy mother ?
she brought soup .
gloria . what are you doing here ?
i came to take care of you .
i &apos;m so sleepy .
good . then the pills are working .
andrew ! danielle !
they &apos;re gone .
it &apos;s just us .
now , you rest , hon .
i &apos;m gonna draw you a nice , warm bath .
oh , bree .
i wish i could make you understand
how deeply i regret having to do this .
monique , that was easy . she was a slut .
you &apos;re a good woman .
you didn &apos;t know orson already had a wife .
but he did .
and he made a vow to her before god .
what sort of mother would i be if i let him break it ?
i &apos;m sorry .
but i will not let him be his father &apos;s son .
wake up , mr. hodge . i &apos;ve got dinner .
that water &apos;s not too hot , is it ?
no , it &apos;s just right .
mom ? you all right ?
andrew .
you &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
is she all right ?
she will be .
get her some blankets and some dry clothes .
orson ?
orson !
something &apos;s wrong .
i think i &apos;m having a stroke .
you need an ambulance , mother .
it &apos;s too bad there &apos;s no one here
who &apos;d dream of calling you one .
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t want her dying in our house .
hey there . are you all right ?
your mother , she tried to kill me .
don &apos;t worry about her .
she &apos;s never gonna hurt you again .
and neither will alma .
alma ?
she &apos;s dead .
what ?
i don &apos;t know what happened , but she &apos;s gone .
and she &apos;s taking our troubles with her .
tomorrow morning , one of our neighbors
will stumble on a gruesome surprise ,
two bodies side by side .
the police will conclude that alma fell from the roof ,
and when my mother found her , she suffered a stroke .
when they search the house ,
they &apos;ll find the note alma wrote when she faked her suicide ,
and next to it a bag containing monique &apos;s teeth .
in the face of such evidence , they &apos;ll have no choice
but to drop the charges against mike delfino .
and then you and i are gonna take that honeymoon
we never got around to .
i &apos;d love that .
what about your mother ?
i mean , after all the things she &apos;s done ,
is she just gonna get off scot @-@ free ?
thank you , doctor . i know you did all you could .
good news , mother .
the doctor said your stroke
has left you completely paralyzed .
you can &apos;t even speak .
which means all our secrets will be safe forever .
oh , here &apos;s the best part .
your brain is functioning normally .
so i don &apos;t have to worry about putting you in jail .
you &apos;re already there .
now , i &apos;m gonna turn your head ,
so you can watch me walk away .
you don &apos;t wanna miss it ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s the last time you &apos;ll ever see me .
&lt; i &gt; a surprising thing happened to orson hodge &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; as he left fairview memorial hospital . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; his life began to flash before his eyes . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but it wasn &apos;t his past he saw . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it was his future . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ordinary suburban days &lt; / i &gt;
