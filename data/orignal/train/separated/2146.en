We lost Chief.
His killer is somewhere in this building.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
Max, you're gonna be fine.
Rachel, it's Danny.
There is zero chance I am letting you
take Grace away from me.
Show me your hands.
Cuff him.
Now that Wo Fat's in jail,
it's time for you to meet Shelburne.
You got time to save one.
What happens to them is entirely up to you.
Malia.
What did you do?!
Where is she?!
She's at home waiting for you,
with dinner in the over. Chicken, I think.
Dump her.
You want answers?
They're all in there.
Mom?
Don't close your eyes, baby.
Open your eyes.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.
Stay with me.
The ambulance is almost here, just stay with me.
Stay with me.
Over here.
Lieutenant, you have to give us some space.
Her pulse is weakened ready.
She's tachycardic.
No breath sounds on the left side.
She's got a tension pneumothorax.
We'll have to needle her. Intubate her.
Her pulse is dropping.
Start compressions.
Kono.
I'm here, baby.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Kono, come on.
Fight.
Come on, Kono.
...six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Come on.
Continue compressions, I'm gonna get epinephrine on board.
Kono!
Come on.
Come on.
She's not responding.
There's got to be something.
There's got to be something!
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
There's nothing more we can do.
Sure you don't want a cup?
Steve?
No, no, thanks.
I know you have a lot of questions, Steve.
Yeah, why don't we start with Shelburne.
Shelburne was the code name the agency gave me.
I'm s... I'm sorry.
Agency? What agency?
Before I met your father,
I worked for an intelligence program
that reported directly to the Pentagon.
You were a spy?
Yes.
So, all those years that I thought you were a...
a schoolteacher, that was just...
A cover.
And, um, were me and Mary just a cover, too?
Shelburne was way before you and Mary.
How'd you meet Wo Fat's father?
He was an assignment.
So, you were ordered to kill him.
It was a little more complicated than that.
Well, we got some time, so why don't you...
why don't you uncomplicate it?
Okay.
Like you, I served my country.
But after I got married, I left the agency
because I wanted to be a mother.
Unfortunately, I could change my name, but...
not my past.
That's why you pretended to be dead?
When I made that choice,
I knew that my life would never be the same.
I knew that I would have to give up
the only thing that meant anything to me: my family.
So, why'd you do it, Doris?
If that's even your real name.
It was the name I was born with,
and the name... the name I went back to
the day I met your father.
And since when does a son call his mother by her first name?
Since you failed to be one 20 years ago.
I didn't see any other options, Steve.
Wo Fat was looking for the person who murdered his father
and he was willing to kill anyone who stood in his way.
So you faked your own death?
Yeah, I did what I had to do to protect my family.
You know, dad sent us away thinking he had to protect us.
Then he spent the next 20 years looking for your killer.
All that was for nothing.
If I had told him the truth,
Wo Fat would have executed him.
Wo Fat executed him anyway.
You and Mary, you...
God knows you deserved better.
I-I just didn't know what else to do, Steve.
I...
But never once, did I spend a day not thinking about you.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?
It's the truth.
What am I supposed to do with that truth, huh?
I just forgive you now,
is that it, we move on?
No, I just...
I'd just like you to understand.
I'd like you to just...
try to understand.
Pack a bag.
Pack? What do you mean?
Where are we... where are we going?
We're going home.
It's not safe, I can't.
Wo Fat can't hurt you.
He's being transferred to a supermax facility
on the mainland today.
By the time we land in Oahu,
he's out of our lives forever.
Unit six be advised.
Unauthorized air approach from the north.
Roger, one.
All units be advised,
we have lost transport.
Repeat, we have lost transport.
Open it up.
Come on!
Frank Delano.
Nice to meet you.
On the phone you said
you were bringing Shelburne back.
Yeah, this is Shelburne.
You can call me mom,someone should.
Mom?
Whose mom?
That'd be mine.
Doris McGarrett.
Danny Williams.
You know, uh, for a woman
who died in a car bomb 20 years ago,
you are remarkably well put together.
Thank you, I'll take that as a compliment.
Sorry to interrupt here.
Danno, I appreciate the homecoming,
but what's with the police presence?
You didn't have to go to all this trouble.
This is not for you.
It's for Shelburne.
Why me?
Wo Fat escaped.
What are you talking...when?
Two hours ago.
Steve, if he finds out I'm on this island...
That's not going to happen.
We're gonna put you someplace safe
and we're gonna hunt down Wo Fat.
Call Chin and Kono.
Have them meet us at the Palace.
What? What is it?
Uh, there's something else you need to know.
He hasn't left Malia's side
since she was brought in.
Chin.
I'm so sorry.
So, wait out here.
Why didn't you tell us?
Delano said he was monitoring your lines,
HPD's, too.
If I would have called you,
Kono and Malia would have been killed immediately.
We should have been there with you.
No.
There was nothing you could have done.
I want Delano.
No, my man had no choice.
Governor, Frank Delano grabbed Officer Kalakaua
and threatened to kill her if he wasn't released from prison.
No, s... ye-yes,
I understand that, sir.
Lieutenant Kelly exercised his full immunity and means,
believing he could contain the situation on his own.
I remember Chin Ho Kelly.
He was a few grades ahead of Steve in school,
was a good boy.
Good boy turned into a good cop.
Losing his wife like that just...
No, Governor...
...makes me think of Steve's dad, you know,
just what he must have gone through.
Yeah, well, a good thing for Chin is
that he doesn't have any kids
that are gonna be asking, "Why isn't mommy coming home?"
Like I said, my man had no choice, Governor.
You married?
Uh, no, not anymore.
Kids?
I do, I have a daughter
named Grace.
Uh, best thing that came out of my marriage.
You ever think about going for round two?
I'd actually rather get kicked in the face with a golf shoe.
Hmm, so, what, you've taken a vow of celibacy or...?
No, I didn't say that.
Uh, I am seeing somebody.
Just-- we're just taking it very slowly.
Yeah, well,
why buy the cow when you can
get the milk for free, right?
Yes, I understand that, Sir.
This is getting very personal, don't you think?
Don't you want your daughter to see you
in a healthy relationship?
Uh, respectfully, I don't think
you are in a position to be giving me parenting advice.
You know what I think, Danno?
I think that you're afraid of commitment.
That's incorrect,
uh, and I prefer Danny.
Oh, really? 'Cause that's
not what I heard my son call you.
He must think you like it.
Oh, he thinks a lot of things that aren't true.
He's delusional, actually,
which, by the way, no offense to the gene pool.
I'm sure he's just a one-off.
Son of a bitch.
He wants a full inquiry into the Delano release.
Steven.
I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah, watch your mouth, Steven.
That goes for you, too, smart-ass.
Okay.
So what's the game plan?
We find Delano and Wo Fat.
And where do we start?
You don't start anywhere, Doris.
You're on ice until this blows over.
I survived two assassination
attempts by the PLO, Steve.
I think I can handle myself, thanks.
I understand that,
but I'm not going to risk losing you again.
You're going some place safe, and I've got
just the person to make sure you stay put.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for calling me.
So, uh, your mom faked her own death
and she's Shelburne.
Well, if you didn't have mommy issues before this...
That's cute.
I try.
Come on, I'll introduce you.
Doris,
this is Lieutenant Rollins.
She's on leave from Naval Intelligence.
He refuses to call me mom.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Lieutenant Rollins,
I told my son I didn't really
need anyone to look out for me.
Oh, he's just being overprotective, ma'am.
It's a SEAL thing, and please call me Catherine.
What does my son call you?
Former intelligence agent.
Needs to know everything.
Unless it's apparent.
Catherine, would you like some tea?
I was just gonna make myself a cup.
That would be great, thank you.
You?
I'll pass.
Okay.
She's something.
Yeah.
So, have you told your sister yet?
No, I don't really feel
like I can tell Mary this one over the phone.
Milk and sugar okay?
Uh, yeah, sounds perfect.
Cath, listen, I got to go, okay?
Keep the doors locked.
SWAT's right outside if you need anything.
Listen, don't worry.
I'm gonna look after her like she's my own mother.
Okay?
That came out wrong.
I didn't think so.
Steve, we figured out
who helped Wo Fat escape this morning.
It was Frank Delano.
Delano?
After Wo Fat's transport van was dumped at sea,
I assumed he was picked up by a boat,
so I checked the security cam footage
of the local marinas of boats leaving and returning,
and I got a hit.
Wo Fat and Delano have to be working together.
The only thing is,
we can't figure out what they're up to.
There's nothing in their files that indicates
they knew each other before today.
What else did the video give us?
I only got a partial plate number
of the vehicle they left in.
We're running it through HPD.
A partial is going to take time.
Maybe not--
the van that they were driving had some rear-end damage,
which means that our driver or whoever owns that car
probably got into a traffic accident.
If they reported it, HPD will have it.
All right, good.
Chin, Kono, check it out.
Yeah, we're on it.
Looks like we got the size right.
What am I doing here?
Right to the point.
I like that.
I'm not gonna waste your time.
I'm about to come into possession
of a very large amount of
a certain controlled substance.
I assume that's the reason you're still on the Island.
I ain't leaving without souvenirs.
Problem is, my most recent incarceration left me
without the resources to unload this kind of weight.
You want me to help.
I need your connections.
Well, I think the obvious question here is:
What's in it for me?
I was gonna offer you a whole lot of green paper,
but I recently came into some information
that's significantly more valuable.
And what's that?
I know where to find the person
that killed your father.
How do you know about Shelburne?
When you got to the joint, created a buzz.
I made some inquiries.
Turns out you've got quite the reputation.
Where is Shelburne?
On the Island.
You're lying.
That's not below me, but not today.
I still got friends inside HPD,
so I know for a fact that Shelburne is right here in O'Ahu.
Before I tell you where...
...I need to know we got a deal.
We do.
Hey, cuz, why don't you go for a walk?
I can finish this.
Hey, Chin.
I heard you.
You don't have to be doing this right now.
I do.
I'm sorry.
You have nothing to be sorry about.
Adam told me what happened-- that you called him
on the way to Malia's.
Chin, you tried to save us both.
Well, it wasn't enough.
It was everything you could do.
Perimeter's secure.
Come join me.
I really shouldn't, ma'am.
Cut the "Ma'am" crap, Catherine.
Neither of us is in uniform. Now, come on.
Please just sit down for a few seconds.
You're making me nervous.
So.
So.
Do you love my son?
Do I...?
Love...?
Stop! Hold it right there!
Go to the bedroom. Lock the door.
Don't move!
Hey, Catherine.
Tell these lolos to chill with the inappropriate touching.
He's clear, boys.
Scampi special.
Mystery solved.
Get back to your job.
McGarrett had asked me to come with some hot grindz.
Better dig in before it becomes shrimp cocktail.
What's for lunch?
You were supposed to lock yourself in the bedroom.
I smelled garlic.
I figured it was safe to come down.
So this moms, eh?
Aloha.
Aloha.
You must be Kamekona.
How did you know that?
Because your face is on that shrimp.
I'd have thought the woman that gave birth
to the great warrior Mcgarrett
would have horns and breathed fire.
Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but...
before my son became a great warrior,
he was just little Stevie,
the boy who wore camouflage footsie PJ's
and called himself G.I. Joe.
Auntie, tell me you have some pictures.
Here we go.
We got a match on that partial plate
from the van Delano and Wo Fat left the marina in.
Owner's name is Maria Gold.
She filed an accident report a couple of weeks ago
after she got rear-ended on the H-1.
It's consistent with the damage on the van
that Delano's crew left the marina in.
Same make and model.
What's her connection to Delano?
I don't know, but this woman's bad news.
Check Fraud, misdemeanor battery,
a slew of possession charges.
And now aiding and abetting two known fugitives.
Maria Gold! Five-O.
Clear!
Clear!
All clear.
Where's Chin?
Guys! Over here.
You got something?
Call Max.
Tell him to bring plenty of body bags.
All right, thank you.
All right, that was Max.
He ID'd our five vics.
Uh, they are local, they got no priors,
and they all worked for the same construction company:
Hana Star Renovators.
Well, according to the bank,
the house that we found them in
used to belong to Maria Gold and is now in foreclosure
so there couldn't have been any work going on.
If that's the case,
then what were our victims doing in this house?
Maybe they were lured there for some reason.
But why?
I don't know.
Why would Wo Fat and Delano want to kill
five construction workers they got no connection to?
Rachel?
Yeah. I, uh, told her
that I was fighting the custody modification.
I guess that didn't go over so well, huh?
Think so?
Rachel, listen to me, okay?
If you have something to say, you can call my lawyer.
I already told you 15 times,
I am not allowing you to move to Las Vegas with my daughter.
This is not about me.
This is about Grace. This is her home now.
Then move!
You move
and leave Grace with me.
If you have a problem with that, I will see you in court.
You know, I was thinking Vegas is, it's not that bad, you know?
I mean, locals call it The Ninth Island.
They don't, they don't call it that for nothing.
Okay, do you know
the only thing that I hate more than the ocean
is the desert.
Okay?
The hot, dry, 120-degree-in-the-shade desert.
Okay, so I am not moving there and neither is my daughter.
Hold on a second.
I thought you liked Vegas.
I lik... in theory, yes. In theory.
An occasional bachelor party,
a poker tournament,
a circus performance, something like that.
I'm mean, to maybe a weekend, but any more than that, I cannot do.
You gotta keep an open mind.
I got... What, are you trying to get rid of me?
No, I'm just saying, Boo Boo, okay?
Boo Boo?
Boo Boo is a term of endearment.
Oh, I know what it is,
but if you are going to give me a sidekick name,
a ridiculous sidekick name,
I should be consulted first.
Okay, so bears are out.
They are out.
Okay, do you have a point? Were you trying to make a point?
Before you interrupted me,
I was gonna say that, um...
I don't know, man, just think about what you're doing.
I mean, you and Rachel go to war,
the only person who's gonna lose is Grace.
Okay, appreciate your help.
Thank you.
That was the owner of the renovation company
that employed our five vics.
He sent them over to Maria Gold's house this morning
to write an estimate for a potential remodeling job,
but get this.
While I'm on the phone with him, his foreman calls
and says the same guys just clocked in at another site.
That's impossible.
They are in cold storage at the county morgue right now.
Wait a sec.
Where's the other job site?
HPD.
The renovation company is contracted to do cleanup there after the explosion.
Did the renovation company say who they were writing an estimate for?
No. The client gave a fake name.
It's Delano.
He lured those guys to that house, then he killed them.
Now he's using their identities to get in the precinct.
Why?
He already blew the place up,
put a dozen cops in the hospital.
What else does he want?
McGarrett, what's going on?
Frank Delano's crew is inside your building.
They came in with the cleanup crew posing as workers.
Where are they?
In the basement. Clearing debris.
That's where they wanted to start.
Duke, are you guys holding anything in the narco room?
Yeah, the evidence from that big ice bust in Kailua.
Go!
It's over here.
He's dead.
I put him down here to watch the door.
Duke, how much meth was in here?
A little over a thousand pounds.
Street value on that kind of weight is $30 to $35 million.
Captain Fryer's killer didn't blow up this building
as a diversion to evade us.
It was all about getting access to this room and boosting the drugs.
Duke, where are their trucks?
They're gone.
They must have just left.
Duke, call it in.
I want roadblocks and checkpoints.
Use traffic cams. Air support. Find them!
You got it! Go! Go!
McGarrett, I got 'em!
Where?
Corner of Ala Moana and Atkinson.
They're slowing for a traffic collision.
Come on, come on, come on. Make a left.
What do you want to do?
Go, go, go!
Chin? Chin!
Cover me!
Move!
Go.
Where do you think you're going?
You're not gonna kill me.
You said it yourself.
You're not a dirty cop, Chin.
Only a dirty cop would shoot an unarmed man.
The whole area's been locked down.
No signs of Wo Fat.
I don't even think he was with him.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Delano?
Dead.
You okay?
No.
Steve!
Steve, over here!
He knows where Wo Fat is.
Where?
Hey, where is he!
Sh-Shelb...
Shelb...
Catherine, where's my mom?
Right in front of me. Why?
Listen, I think Wo Fat is on his way to the house.
Secure the perimeter. We're on the way.
Was that Steve?
Catherine...what's going on?
I need you to come upstairs with me, now.
It's Wo Fat, isn't it?
We've been compromised.
Steve's on his way.
I want a gun.
Keep the door locked.
Don't let anyone in, no matter what happens.
You understand?
Sweetheart, I've been doing this before you were born.
You okay?
Where's Wo Fat?
He got away.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom.
You saved my life.
That almost makes us even.
You saved mine twice.
Yeah, I remember the night McGarrett brought Wo Fat in.
When was the second time?
The day we met.
I can't... can't leave, Steve.
Not again. I can't...
You can't stay here.
So long as Wo Fat is free, you're never gonna be safe.
Well, I can't go back to Japan.
I mean, your search for me compromised that area.
Okay, so pick another country.
Just don't tell me or anybody outside of your handlers.
There's no way to guarantee your safety if you do.
I promise, as soon as this is over
I'll come and find you.
How?
Same way I did the first time.
Okay? Come on.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
Good-bye, mom.
Just because I wasn't around
doesn't mean I wasn't your mother.
I never stopped loving you.
You okay?
Your mother said that she exchanged gunfire with Wo Fat, right?
Yeah, right before he escaped out the window. Why?
Crime lab just finished processing the safe house.
Found evidence of only one weapon being fired in that bedroom.
Ballistics matched it to the gun that Catherine gave Doris.
All three slugs were pulled out of the floor.
So either your mother is a terrible shot,
or she deliberately tried not to shoot Wo Fat.
You're saying you think she let him get away?
No, I'm asking:
why didn't she kill him when she had the chance?
