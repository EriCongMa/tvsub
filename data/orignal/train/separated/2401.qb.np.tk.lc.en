mystic falls ... i was born here .
this is my home .
and mine .
and mine .
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ...
witches .
and even hybrids .
some search for a cure ...
no matter what the consequences .
others plot a revolution .
do you want to be free ?
we have to work together .
and some try to walk away .
elena is sired to damon .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be able to do what i need to
when i have to tell elena to stay away from me .
i know what you &apos;re about to do .
please don &apos;t do this to me .
i &apos;m not the good guy , remember ?
i &apos;m the selfish one .
but i have to do the right thing by you .
this would be so much more fun if we were naked .
that was your call , not mine .
i was being a gentleman .
you shouldn &apos;t have stayed .
i know .
i should have made you leave ,
sent you packing .
i promised stefan .
i know .
you &apos;re sired to me , elena ,
which means everything that you think you feel
might not even be real .
i know , damon , but ...
it feels real .
and i &apos;m not ready to let go of that .
i could make you .
invoke the sire bond .
so do it .
i told him i would set you free .
right after i didn &apos;t tell him that we slept together .
so , what do you want to do ?
i want to throw you back in my bed and never let you leave .
so do it .
saved by the cell phone .
i have to meet bonnie .
she &apos;s teaching jeremy how not to kill me .
want to come ?
looks like a giant snowflake .
i prefer to think of it as an expression of post @-@ modernism .
it &apos;s my donation to the winter wonderland charity event .
you said it was urgent ?
yes . take this to the mystic grill immediately .
you want me to be a delivery guy ?
what i want is for you to do whatever i say ,
without the attitude .
be careful with that .
it &apos;s still wet .
abraham lincoln freed the slaves , you know .
what is the point of my hybrids being sired to me
if i can &apos;t maximize on the benefits of free labor ?
what are you doing here ?
elena is sired to damon .
i into it as much .
which means i need to find the cure now more than ever ,
and here you are making post @-@ modern snowflakes .
i &apos;ve delivered .
i retrieved the hunter &apos;s sword from italy ,
which &apos; ll use to decipher the map hidden in the hunter &apos;s mark .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s supposed to deliver the hunter and his mark .
jeremy is the hunter ,
and he has to keep killing vampires to complete his mark ,
but we can &apos;t quite figure out how to keep him from killing us .
sounds like quite the chore ,
which is why i feel perfectly justified in doing a little charity work .
or maybe you &apos;re lying about having found the sword .
why would i lie to you , sefan ?
we &apos;re in this together .
the hilt acts as a cypher which
we &apos;ll use to decode the marks on jeremy &apos;s tattoo
when he &apos;s killed enough vampires to complete it .
i heard you moved out of your house .
bit of a martyr move ?
i &apos;m not here to bond , klaus .
on the contrary ,
i think right now i &apos;m the best friend you &apos;ve got .
i &apos;m sick of taking his crap .
i should rip his throat off ,
see if he can boss us around without a larynx .
you won &apos;t have to take it much longer .
you keep saying that , but here we are hiding ,
plotting a revolution that &apos;s never gonna happen .
never say never .
and never say i don &apos;t pull through .
i found the witch that &apos;s gonna save your lives .
are you serious ?
we promised you guys we &apos;d free you from klaus .
you did your part by breaking your sire bond .
now hayley and i are going to do ours .
you &apos;re going to do what ?
hayley found a witch strong enough to do the body @-@ jump spell--
you know , the klaus specialty .
so you &apos;re going to put him in someone else &apos;s body ,
and then what ?
we &apos;ll encase the body in concrete , then bury it .
why not just desiccate him like bonnie did ?
because to do that spell ,
you have to stop a human heart .
i was a little short of volunteers .
who was dumb enough to volunteer their body to be a klaus sublet ?
ok , don &apos;t freak out .
freak out ?
freak out ?
i &apos;m about to hemorrhage . you volunteered ?
it &apos;s not forever ,
just long enough for the hybrids to be able to completely disappear .
i can think of better ways for us to spend our senior year
than you buried in concrete , tyler .
this started with me .
this has to end with me .
i need your support .
jeremy ?
they shouldn &apos;t be here .
they &apos;re here to help you .
do you trust me ?
yeah , i trust you .
let &apos;s go inside .
what the hell is professor shadypants doing here ?
i invited him .
hey , listen . we are ready to get started ,
but before we can do that ,
we need her ...
in here .
this is your house now , jer .
you have to invite me in .
go ahead , jeremy . invite her in .
you can come in .
jeremy !
hey . sorry . i know i &apos;m late .
if i &apos;m gonna be a friend in your time of need ,
then you need to work on your punctuality .
i &apos;m in a crisis . where are you ?
i &apos;m at my house . why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
my boyfriend dumb @-@ ass martyr .
and why are you at your house ?
aren &apos;t you trying to keep your distance from elena ?
well , she &apos;s not here anymore .
damon took jeremy at the gilbert lake house with bonnie ,
so i guess her house is safe for her again .
hey , listen , i got klaus to tell me a little bit more hunter &apos;s sword .
you know that map in jeremy &apos;s tattoo ?
the sword decodes it .
it &apos;s literally the key to finding the cure .
klaus told you this ?
yeah . why ?
and did he happen to hand over the sword for safekeeping ?
uh , what do you think ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
we need to get our hands on that sword , like , today .
tyler his hybrids are taking out klaus tonight .
here to steal tiny tim &apos;s crutches ?
dickens was a dark man .
you would have liked him .
nice snowflake , by the way .
is my work really that literal ?
i &apos;m serious .
there &apos;s something ...
lonely about it .
i &apos;m gonna take that as a compliment .
can i offer you some champagne ?
can &apos;t . too many adult prying eyes .
don &apos;t wanna be a high @-@ school cautionary tale
at the next town meeting .
well , then , it &apos;s a good thing the high @-@ school part is nearly over .
if we &apos;re gonna be nice to each other ,
then i will need that glass of champagne .
is that our thing ?
we don &apos;t have a &quot; thing . &quot;
allow me .
well , he &apos;s not walking around with it .
check the rest of the house .
i am . i haven &apos;t found anything .
try the sock drawer .
people leave the sketchiest stuff in sock drawers .
i &apos;m gonna need real ideas , damon .
here &apos;s two : kill tyler before he goes to klaus ,
or , since klaus has suddenly become
mvp in our relay race for the cure ,
tell him about the hybrids . and he will kill tyler .
nobody &apos;s killing tyler .
hello ?
stefen .
look , i know it &apos;s a touchy subject ,
but do you know where elena is today ?
i think she &apos;s running around ...
trying to figure out how to deprogram jeremy .
w &apos;d take it last night--
you telling her to stay away from you ?
not well .
you ok ?
peachy .
got to go bonnie &apos;s enlisted dr. evil in her plan ,
and i have to thwart him .
all jeremy feels when he sees a vampire
is a burning desire to kill them .
even if consciously he doesn &apos;t want to ,
as in your case ,
it &apos;s his subconscious that &apos;s calling the shots .
persuasion helps reverse your conscious thoughts .
think of it as kind of a conditioned response , right ?
see vampire , kill vampire .
what i &apos;m doing is creating a kind of middle step .
it &apos;s like a detour where his subconscious
learns to recognize you as someone he loves ,
someone he wants to protect .
and that gives him a choice .
he can choose to take the detour
instead of a conditioned response .
ok . talk to him . he &apos;ll listen .
i &apos;m not ... sure what to say .
you chose to do this here at your family &apos;s vacation house , right ?
so maybe just start by telling him why .
every holiday , we came here .
this place was family ,
and when mom and dad died ,
jenna made us come here ,
and we thoug it was an awful idea ,
but it was like they were here with us .
they would have wanted us to stick together , jer ...
to fight for each other
no matter what .
jeremy , how do you feel about elena right now ?
she ruin our lifes .
she &apos;s not even my real sister .
she &apos;s just the reason that everyone i &apos;ve ever loved has died .
she means nothing to me .
i will kill her even if that means i die myself .
did it work ?
did you find the sword ?
nope .
what are we gonna do now ?
klaus is the only shot we have at finding the cure .
we need him . tyler has to call it off .
well , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
you told him ?
i &apos;ve had 12 hybrids sworn to secrecy for a month .
i have hayley and a witch risking their lives ,
and you &apos;re blabbing my plan to him ?
look , all i &apos;m asking you for is a little bit of time , ok ?
how long ? an hour ? a day ?
because every minute that goes by that we don &apos;t do this ,
they &apos;re at risk .
you and klaus already served one of them up for jeremy to kill .
i don &apos;t owe you anything .
i &apos;m taking him out .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t let you do that .
stephan--
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t .
stefan .
sorry , man , but you don &apos;t have a choice .
you &apos;re not allowed to feel this sorry for yourself
unless you &apos;re sitting on a bar stool .
fortunately , i travel with we bar .
it didn &apos;t work .
i shouldn &apos;t have put so much hope into reprogramming someone &apos;s mind .
if it were that easy ,
then you and i wouldn &apos;t be in this situation .
right ?
last time i was here ,
i was so completely in love with stefan .
now it &apos;s barely a memory .
is that the sire bond ...
or just that i &apos;m so happy to be here with you ?
maybe there &apos;s something else they can try .
tyler .
keep them down here until we &apos;re ready to bring klaus in .
use these if you have to .
come on , tyler .
this is bigger than you .
it &apos;s about more than revenge for us .
i know what it &apos;s about for you , stefan .
it &apos;s about the cure .
you know what happens to a hybrid when he &apos;s cured of being a vampire ?
we go back to being werewolves ,
turning on every full moon .
we could give a rat &apos;s ass about the cure .
tyler , come on .
i needed you on my side , caro .
that &apos;s all i wanted .
you ok ?
shane wants to try again .
survey says ...
professor shane has been dipping into the magical herbs a little too much
if he thinks using a vampire to suppress the need to kill another one
is going to work on a hunter .
it &apos;s like dangling a cheeseburger in front of someone on a master cleanse .
just find someone else to touch your warm and fuzzy detour feelings to .
gee , i wonder who that could be .
you .
i feel that way about you .
well , this isn &apos;t awkward at all .
i &apos;ll be ... anywhere else .
it was good thinking using bonnie as jeremy &apos;s emotional touchstone .
damon is very intuitive .
and bonnie told me about your relationship with him .
i don &apos;t mean pry , obviously .
it &apos;s ... complicated .
any ideas how to hypnotize me out of it ?
you know , in all my world travels ,
the one spell that i &apos;ve never found
is how to break someone from loving too much .
trust me , i &apos;ve looked .
my wife and son died .
i was just--i was trying to figure out a way not to miss them .
if your hypno @-@ herbs work ,
we should be singing &quot; kumbaya &quot; around the fire by dinner .
so now tell me why i &apos;m not killing you .
damon .
i &apos;m serious .
why are you after the vampire cure ?
i didn &apos;t say i was looking for the cure ,
but i can tell you where to find it .
klaus &apos; sword will tellls us where to find .
the sword will lead you there , sure ,
but so can i.
what ? how ?
because i &apos;ve already been there .
instruct the guest to drop their donations at the gift tree in the grill .
yes , ma &apos;am .
excuse me .
there you are .
quick , a toast before people can judge us .
what &apos;s wrong ?
please say something .
but you &apos;ll miss graduation .
which ... i guess is a ridiculous thing to worry about .
i &apos;m their alpha .
they &apos;re looking to me to help them .
you do what you have to do , tyler .
don &apos;t look so shocked .
i &apos;m trying to channel your father .
he &apos;d be proud of you , you know .
you &apos;re a leader of people , just like he was .
thank you , mom .
it &apos;s a rock .
it &apos;s not just any rock .
hmm . so is this that silly little
wives &apos; tale that you told at the occult exhibit ?
all right , long story short--
once upon a time , there was a witch named silas
who loved a girl and wanted to be with her forever .
so he and his best friend , another witch ,
made an immortality spell .
and then silas &apos; best friend witch got jealous
and killed silas &apos; girl before he had a chance to make her immortal .
well , cursed to an eternity without his one true love ,
silas finds a way to reverse the immortality spell .
and then , before he has a chance to take it ,
his former friend buries him underground ,
leaving him and the cure to rot .
so it &apos;s a cure for immortality ?
human blood is the life force of an immortal .
no more immortality ,
no more need to feed on blood .
you dig up silas ,
and you &apos;ve got your cure .
oh , this is ridiculous .
we are not hostages .
sure you are , sweetie .
relax .
it &apos;s my brother .
what &apos;s up ?
don &apos;t ask how or why or who ,
but i just found the answer to your tyler problem .
you &apos;re kidding .
we don &apos;t need the sword .
this is the mark
of the brotherhood of the five .
then up the arm , you have the murder of a girl by a witch .
the symbols in the vines are your map ,
which you obviously no longer need .
when this mark is complete ,
it will contain the spell that we need to dig up silas .
and where did you say he was buried ?
oh , i forgot . you didn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve threatened to kill me , what , like , 3 times already this week ?
the location is how i &apos;m gonna survive your bad moods .
and what &apos;s in it for you ?
if not the cure , then what ?
i &apos;m in this for silas , all right ?
up until this point , he &apos;s only been a myth .
so write a thesis .
would you rather be the guy who writes about noah &apos;s ark
or the one who sails it down the hudson river ?
i &apos;m not buying it .
you don &apos;t have to buy anything .
you just have to believe
that i can fix your brother
and when his hunter &apos;s mark is complete ,
i &apos;m gonna take you to the cure .
how the hell did you even get out ?
i got out because even your idiot hybrids
recognized the stupidity of your alpha hybrid martyr plan .
i &apos;m not going to fight with you anymore , caroline .
oh , we &apos;re gonna do plenty of fighting ,
the second that you shove klaus into someone else &apos;s body .
we &apos;ve been through this . i don &apos;t have anyone else &apos;s body .
yeah ? well , i do .
what ? who ?
klaus &apos; sister rebekah .
she &apos;s got a dagger in her .
stefan &apos;s been hiding her coffin in the tunnels .
we dump klaus into her body and bury her .
we just killed two original birds with one stone .
it &apos;s too late to change the plans .
call bonnie .
make sure it &apos;ll work .
tyler .
it &apos;s a brilliant plan , hayley .
you &apos;re a genius . i love you .
i love you , even when i hate you .
我们有麻烦了
i got to go find my mom ,
let her know i might actually graduate .
海莉 : 计划要失败了
how &apos;s it going ?
i think we &apos;re making progress .
caroline , hey .
bonnie , i need you to think fast .
i know that the daggers don &apos;t work on klaus ,
but what if we put his essence into rebekah ?
it &apos;ll work , right ? say it &apos;ll work .
slow down what &apos;s happening ?
just come on , bonnie . will it work ?
补救好
yeah . i don &apos;t see why not .
bonnie bennett , i love you .
do you need my help ?
i can leave elena here with jeremy .
elena ? she &apos;s there , too ?
yeah , she came here with damon ,
who &apos;s being slightly less horrible than usual .
you know what ? i can &apos;t deal with this right now .
she said it would work .
i gathered . congratulations .
thank you .
my pleasure .
jer and i should take these decorations home with us .
we could use the holiday cheer .
look at you , suddenly ply optimist .
i think shane &apos;s gonna get us through this .
i trust him .
which you clearly don &apos;t .
maybe because i think he blew up 12 people at the young farm .
what ?
a little tip , professor ,
i heard you before you even took your first step .
i see we &apos;re back to the false accusation part of our relationship .
what is he talking about ?
da--damon discovered that i was in contact
pastor young prior to the explosion at the young farm .
the pastor was severely depressed .
he had lost his wife to cancer ,
and he sought me out for a little supernatural assistance .
i tried to help , but he was too far gone .
it &apos;s just i never expected that he &apos;d take 12 innocents with him .
elena .
it &apos;s ok .
i think we &apos;ve got this .
elena , don &apos;t move , ok ?
no matter what .
jeremy , remember the detour .
choose the right path .
she doesn &apos;t like me much .
where have you been all day ?
i &apos;ve been around .
i &apos;m not interested in vagaries , stefan .
you &apos;ve been dodgy and caroline &apos;s been lovely ,
which i &apos;ve come to recognize as a tool of distraction .
now do you have something to share with me ,
or should i compel it out of you ?
i broke into your safe to look for the sword .
why ?
because i don &apos;t trust you .
i showed you the sword .
i explained its value .
i &apos;ve been on your side the entire time .
what do you want from me ?
a secret brotherhood handshake ?
i found the letters .
you have a few pen pals over the centuries .
well , is keeping my victims &apos; letters
really so different from writing their names on a wall ,
like you did ?
ripper ?
loneliness , stefan .
that &apos;s why you and i memorialize our dead .
there &apos;s the briefest of moments before we kill
where we literally hold their life in our hands ,
and then we rip it away ,
and we &apos;re left nothing .
so gathering other people &apos;s letters
or writing their names on a wall--
it &apos;s a reminder ...
that in the end we &apos;re left infinitely
and utterly alone .
oh . sorry .
hello ? are you ok ?
oh , my gosh ! caroline !
somebody help ! help !
holy crap !
have you seen hayley ?
you didn &apos;t have a pulse .
you were dead .
stefan , it &apos;s me .
that little werewolf slut has lost her mind .
go to the lockwood cellar
and make sure that rebekah &apos;s body is still there .
i &apos;m gonna find tyler .
hayley is trying to screw this up .
forget everything you just saw and heard .
you are miss mystic falls ,
and you have duties to fulfill .
ok
there you are .
stefan has been looking for you .
adrian &apos;s leading klaus to the cellar .
how come the only time april young
isn &apos;t following you around like a lost puppy
is when i &apos;m lying dead with a broken neck ?
april saw you ?
yeah . it &apos;s ok . i compelled her .
she &apos;s--she &apos;s wearing jere &apos;s vervain bracelet
she can &apos;t be compelled .
hey , mom . i don &apos;t see you .
things have changed . it &apos;s gonna be fine .
i &apos;ll be back later . i &apos;ll pick you up .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be taking the witch to the cellar .
there is no witch , tyler .
what ?
i made it up .
where the hell is the witch ?
adrian should be here any minute .
kim .
no !
i never intended for you to put klaus down .
i needed him for the sacrifice .
the what ?
i don &apos;t know how to explain it
but i made a deal with someone
who can help me find my family .
what are you talking about ? what kind of deal ?
there needed to be 12 for the sacrifice , tyler .
12 what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
hayley , what did you do ?
if you run now , you might make it out alive .
where is tyler lockwood ?
you &apos;d do well to answer me , love .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
wrong answer .
check this out .
jenna used that to make out with logan fell .
all the drama you &apos;re missing , the actual fun part .
elena we can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
damon , you can &apos;t keep telling me that this isn &apos;t real .
i know how i feel and that you feel it , too ,
so stop fighting it .
it &apos;s good to see you like that--
all normal with your brother .
i want that again for you .
christmas was always mine and stefan &apos;s favorite holiday when we were kids ,
not that i &apos;ve celebrated since .
i kind of miss that .
you &apos;re thinking about how upset he &apos;ll be when he finds out
that you and i are together .
i &apos;ve been lying to him all day .
no . you were helping me with jeremy .
the point isn &apos;t what i was doing ,
the point is that i &apos;m here with you .
i was supposed to invoke the sire bond , elena .
send you away .
i was supposed to do the right thing by you
and the right thing by my brother .
which is what i &apos;m gonna do right now .
you &apos;re gonna go home .
what ? no . damon--
i &apos;m gonna stay here with jeremy .
i &apos;m gonna help him complete the mark .
i &apos;ll teach him how to hunt .
i &apos;ll protect him , and we &apos;ll kill vampires
without you .
damon , please .
i &apos;m setting you free , elena .
this is what i want .
it is what will make me happy .
i can &apos;t find april . i can &apos;t reach tyler .
this is a disaster .
is this you in crisis mode ?
because it &apos;s a lot more stealth than mine .
i thought i &apos;d be happier
watching klaus get led away to the slaughter ,
but for some reason i can &apos;t help but feel kind of ...
guilty .
yeah . you and me both .
all day i &apos;ve been trying to remind myself
of all the horrible things he &apos;s done .
see , that &apos;s the thing .
we &apos;ve all done horrible things .
and i &apos;m sitting here trying to figure out
what makes us any better than him .
and i think it &apos;s just that we have family we can trust .
yeah .
you &apos;re right , stefan .
trust is everything .
have you heard from damon ?
yeah . he &apos;s still with jeremy at the lake house .
did he happen to mention ...
where elena was ?
wait . why are you--why are you asking me this ?
they &apos;re together , aren &apos;t they ?
how together are they ?
caroline , tell me .
how together are they ?
thank you .
i was ready to fight you on this ,
but suddenly every part of my body is telling me
that i need to get in this car and leave you .
so do it .
tyler , honey ,
you &apos;re supposed to be in my sober cab .
i think i drank half the party .
good evening , carol .
if you &apos;re looking for tyler ,
i &apos;d like a little word with him myself .
klaus , please .
don &apos;t hurt him .
he &apos;s my son .
he &apos;s all i have .
and you &apos;re all he has .
there &apos;s a beautiful symmetry to that , don &apos;t you think ?
