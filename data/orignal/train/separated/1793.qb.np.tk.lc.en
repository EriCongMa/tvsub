oh , look , &lt; i &gt; saturn 3 &lt; / i &gt; is on .
i don &apos;t want to watch &lt; i &gt; saturn 3 . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; deep space nine &lt; / i &gt; is better .
how is &lt; i &gt; deep space nine &lt; / i &gt; better than &lt; i &gt; saturn 3 ? &lt; / i &gt;
simple subtraction will tell you it &apos;s six better .
compromise . watch &lt; i &gt; babylon 5 . &lt; / i &gt;
in what sense is that a compromise ?
well , five is partway between three ... never mind .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
how about we go rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors ?
ooh , i don &apos;t think so .
anecdotal evidence suggests
that in the game of rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors ,
players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80 % of the time
due to the limited number of outcomes .
i suggest rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors @-@ lizard @-@ spock .
what ?
it &apos;s very simple .
scissors cuts paper . paper covers rock .
rock crushes lizard .
lizard poisons spock .
spock smashes scissors . scissors decapitates lizard .
lizard eats paper . paper disproves spock .
spock vaporizes rock .
and as it always has , rock crushes scissors .
okay , i think i got it .
rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors- lizard @-@ spock !
hello , boys .
ahoy , matey .
noticed the eye patch , did you ?
it &apos;s all part of a technique i &apos;ve been studying
for picking up women .
you employ a visual display
designed to make yourself
distinctive and memorable .
oh , yes , like the male peacock with brilliant plumage
or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters .
or in this case , the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye .
mock me if you will , but it works .
you show up at a club in something distinctive ,
scope out your target and toss out some negs .
what are negs ?
a neg is a negative compliment
that throws a pretty woman off her game ,
like &quot; normally , i &apos;m not turned on by big teeth ,
but on you , they work . &quot;
i got a whole list of &apos; em . who wants to be my wingman ?
you &apos;re not gonna need wingman .
you &apos;re gonna need a paramedic .
howard , your scooter &apos;s blocking my car .
aw , did you get pinkeye again ?
step one : she notices the eye patch .
may i say , penny ,
not a lot of women could look as hot as you do
with such greasy hair ?
yeah , just move your stupid scooter
before i pick it up and throw it in the dumpster .
ow .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not going to watch &lt; i &gt; the clone wars &lt; / i &gt; tv series
until i &apos;ve seen &lt; i &gt; the e clone wars &lt; / i &gt; movie .
i prefer to let george lucas disappoint me
in the order he intended .
well , i want to watch it now .
then i believe we &apos;ve arrived at another quintessential
rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors- lizard @-@ spock moment .
watch whatever you want .
i saw what you did there .
what &apos;d i do ?
hello . hey , howard .
what &apos;s wrong ?
okay . okay , we &apos;ll be right there .
what happened ?
howard &apos;s at the mars rover lab . he says he &apos;s in trouble .
defcon 5 .
defcon 5 ?
well , there &apos;s no need to rush .
what ?
defcon 5 means &quot; no danger . &quot;
defcon 1 is a crisis .
how can 5 not be worse than 1 ?
yeah , &lt; i &gt; star trek v &lt; / i &gt; worse than &lt; i &gt; i. &lt; / i &gt;
okay , first of all , that &apos;s a comparison of quality ,
not intensity .
secondly , &lt; i &gt; star trek i &lt; / i &gt; is orders @-@ of @-@ magnitude worse
than &lt; i &gt; star trek v. &lt; / i &gt;
are you joking ? &lt; i &gt; star trek v &lt; / i &gt; is the standard
against which all badness is measured .
no , no .
&lt; i &gt; star trek v &lt; / i &gt; has specific failures
in writing and direction ,
while &lt; i &gt; star trek i &lt; / i &gt; fails across the board :
art direction , costuming , music , sound editing .
can we just forget i said defcon and go ?
&lt; i &gt; star trek v. &lt; / i &gt;
all right , will you at least stipulate
that &lt; i &gt; star trek iv : &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; the voyage home &lt; / i &gt; is inarguably the best ?
i have three words for you :
&lt; i &gt; wrath of khan . &lt; / i &gt;
oh , thank god , you &apos;re here .
what &apos;s the emergency ?
i got the mars rover stuck in a ditch .
where ?
on a dusty highway just outside bakersfield .
where do you think ? on mars !
howard , is everything okay ?
yeah , baby , i &apos;ll be right in .
you brought a girl to the mars rover control room ?
yeah , i picked her up in the bar . she &apos;s a doctor .
one free barium enema ,
and my mother won &apos;t care she &apos;s not jewish .
wait a minute .
so the eye patch and e insults worked ?
no , there were three other guys with eye patches .
it was a fiasco .
what did work was , &quot; how &apos;d you like to visit
a secret government facility ? &quot;
so what exactly do you want us to do ?
i need you and raj to help me get the rover out of the ditch
and i need you to get stephanie out
before somebody notices she &apos;s here .
she doesn &apos;t exactly have clearance .
really ? they don &apos;t let strange women from honky @-@ tonks come in
and play with $ 200 million government projects
on distant planets ?
yes , i was bad . maybe she &apos;ll spank me .
can we please move on ?
hey , howard , you know , it &apos;s getting late ,
so do i get to drive this thing or what ?
yeah . no . i &apos;m sorry , but something &apos;s come up .
kind of a mars rover ... mars rover
can howard come over ...
situation .
so my friend leonard is gonna take you home .
oh , okay . let &apos;s go , friend leonard .
i &apos;ll call ya .
yeah . so are you a scientist like howard ?
no one &apos;s a scientist like howard .
my mother is so gonna love her .
how nice . maybe they can carpool
when they visit you in federal prison .
i &apos;m sorry . i totally interrupted you .
what , what , what were you saying ?
just said howard &apos;s a terrific guy .
he &apos;s got a great sense of humor .
he loves his mother ...
a lot .
people say &quot; too much . &quot;
i really like that you &apos;re such a loyal friend .
yeah , i am loyal .
you know , if you look at the big picture .
out of curiosity ,
did he ever have a shot with you ?
are you insane ?
the guy was wearing an eye patch .
then why did you ... ?
he said that i cou drive a car on mars .
got it .
so , can i see you again ?
you &apos;re not gonna see me now .
cool .
anything ?
actually , i was just checking my e @-@ mail .
but , uh , no , the rover is not responding .
i believe the appropriate metaphor here
involves a river of excrement
and a native american water vessel
without any means of propulsion .
hang on .
there &apos;s got to be other options .
you could try calling triple @-@ a.
but based on nasa &apos;s latest timetable ,
they won &apos;t get there for 35 years .
plus i understand you have to be standing
next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive .
oh , snap .
snap what ?
okay , i guess we have to turn to plan b.
what &apos;s plan b ?
erase all the hard drives , scrap the surveillance tapes ,
wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run .
why wasn &apos;that plan a ?
a nasa spokesman states that due to the loss of data ,
they will most likely be unable to determine the cause
of the mars rover &apos;s malfunction .
this is not the first time an exploratory mission to mars
has ended in disappointment .
thank god for plan b.
howard , didn &apos;t you say you worked on the mars rover ?
no , you &apos;re mistaken .
yeah , when we first met ,
you said that if i went out with you ,
i could drive a car on mars .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
will you all excuse me ?
leonard is subtly signaling
that he &apos;d like to talk to me in private .
no . yeah , i remember specifically .
you started by asking if i was from mars
because my ass was out of this world .
well , that does sound like me , but no .
is there some problem ?
yeah .
listen , i have to kinda sneak out for a while .
all right , good @-@ bye .
no , wait !
if anyone asks you where i went , you don &apos;t know .
where are you going ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
who would ask me ?
i can &apos;t tell you that , either .
so you brought me in here to inform me
that you can &apos;t tell me where you &apos;re going
and you can &apos;t tell me who might ask ?
yeah , i really didn &apos;t think this through .
leonard , a moment .
what ?
if someone-- and of course , we don &apos;t know who this would be--
does ask where you &apos;ve gone , what should i say ?
i don &apos;t know . just tell &apos; em i went to the office .
are you going to the office ? no .
then how can i say it convincingly ?
just say , &quot; leonard went to the office . &quot;
all right . leonard went to &lt; i &gt; the office . &lt; / i &gt;
what is ... ? no , not like that !
just , &quot; leonard went to the office . &quot;
this would have worked out a lot better
if you &apos;d just told me you were going to the office .
i &apos;m going to the office .
see ? why don &apos;t i believe you ?
i &apos;m going out for a while .
okay .
doesn &apos;t anyone want to know where he &apos;s going ?
okay , where is he going ?
leonard is going to &lt; i &gt; the office . &lt; / i &gt;
so how was work today ?
busy .
i removed an appendix , a gall bladder
and about a foot and a half of bowel .
i &apos;m hoping that &apos;s three different guys .
no , just the one .
he didn &apos;t make it .
so , how was your day ?
oh , you know , i &apos;m a physicist , so ...
i thought about stuff .
that &apos;s it ?
well , i wrote some of it down .
are you done eating ?
uh , yeah . oh , good .
if i knew you were waiting ,
i would &apos;ve swallowed that lasagna whole .
you &apos;ve reached dr. stephanie barnett .
leave a message .
hey , steph ,
it &apos;s me again , howard .
listen , if you &apos;re free friday ,
maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place .
my mom cooks a hell of a brisket .
let me know .
it &apos;s howard .
i &apos;ve had her brisket . melts in your mouth .
maybe we should think about going to the bedroom .
that &apos;s a good idea .
there &apos;s a bed in there , and i &apos;m very ...
very , very pro @-@ bed .
you &apos;ve reached dr. stephanie barnett .
leave a message .
hey , it &apos;s me again .
just want to let you know
the head count for dinner friday has gone up .
my aunt betty and uncle elliot are coming in from palm springs .
oh , and if anybody should ask ,
you &apos;re half @-@ jewish on your mother &apos;s side .
okay , call me .
it &apos;s howard .
don &apos;t you think we should tell him you &apos;re not interested ?
do you want me to stop and call him back right now ?
dear god , no !
oh , leonard ...
you &apos;ve reached dr. stephanie barnett .
leave a message .
hey , it &apos;s me again . howard .
listen , my cousins from fort lauderdale
are flying in to meet you
so that means we &apos;re gonna have to move the dinner
to a restaurant .
tell her we &apos;re going to the olive garden !
i have a coupon from the paper .
we &apos;re not going to the olive garden , mom !
oh , mr. bigshot with his red lobster .
i &apos;ll call you back when we firm up the details .
it &apos;s howard .
new shirts ?
yeah , a couple .
nice . thank you .
so , who &apos;s the girl ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
well , last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating .
so what we did was in fact dating ?
well , yeah , we did have a date .
exactly . thank you .
do me a favor . tell koothrappali that next time you see him .
so , who is she ?
oh , she &apos;s a doctor .
oh , nice .
a doctor doctor , or a you kind of doctor ?
doctor doctor .
surgical resident .
smart , pretty .
let me ask you something .
if your friend thinks he &apos;s dating someone ,
but he &apos;s not because , in fact , you &apos;re dating her ,
does that make you a bad person ?
well , that depends .
on what ?
is that friend wolowitz ?
yeah .
screw him . you &apos;re fine .
are you sure ?
well , have you slept with her yet ?
you dog !
good for you .
does that change things ?
no .
so why &apos;d you ask ?
i &apos;m nosy . see ya .
howard , get the door !
really ? is that what you do when someone knocks ? !
thank you . i had no idea !
hey , buddy . what brings you to my little slice of hell ?
who is it ? !
it &apos;s leonard !
you &apos;re gonna have to play outside !
i &apos;m not dressed to receive !
no one cares , ma !
so , what &apos;s up ?
listen , i need to talk to you about something .
momentito .
yello .
oh , stephanie ,
thanks for calling me back . i was worried ...
no , i understand .
sure , we can be friends . absolutely .
thanks for calling .
yeah , you have a nice day , too .
you are dead to me .
okay , who gets the extra dumpling ?
rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors- lizard @-@ spock .
okay , one of us is going to have to stop putting up spock .
how do we decide that ? rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors- lizard @-@ spock .
oh , hey , guys .
hello .
hi , howard .
howard ?
sheldon .
howard is employing
a schoolyard paradigm in which you are ,
for all intents and purposes , deceased .
he intends
to act on this by not speaking to you ,
feigning an inability to hear you when you speak
and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence .
that &apos;s just ridiculous .
why are you cooperating with him ?
i don &apos;t make the rules , leonard .
howard , come on . i didn &apos;t plan on this .
these things just happen .
usually not to me , but they do happen .
did someone just feel a cold breeze ?
i believe this is an extension of the death metaphor .
the cold breeze is the so @-@ called ectoplasmic issue
of a disembodied soul passing by .
you know , screw it . i &apos;m just gonna eat the dumpling .
hey . oh , hi , steph .
come on in . is this a bad time ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t see a better one on the horizon , so ...
oh , if it isn &apos;t mrs. dead to me .
hello , howard .
sheldon ?
i &apos;m sorry , you violated the terms of your metaphor
by acknowledging her existence . i &apos;m out .
he just won &apos;t listen to me .
okay , i guess it &apos;ll just be the three of us then .
lisa &apos;s gonna be disappointed . yeah .
lisa ?
yeah , my roommate .
she just went throh a really bad breakup
and i thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you .
leonard , stephanie , you &apos;re alive ! it &apos;s a miracle .
so , anyway , lisa , i just wanted to tell you again
how much i enjoyed the other night ,
and again , i &apos;m sorry for how it ended .
but again , if you could let me know about friday .
my mother needs a head count
so she can know how big a brisket to get .
howard , howard , look at this .
anyway , call me .
the possibility of life on mars has long fascinated scientists it &apos;s howard .
and laypersons alike .
it &apos;s unclear how the mars rover got into the crevice ,
but one thing &apos;s certain :
the data which it has sent back contain
the first clear indications
that there may have been life on mars .
it &apos;s a scientific discovery
that has staggering implications for all mankind .
unfortunately , we &apos;ll never know who &apos;s responsible .
