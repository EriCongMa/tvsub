simple assault .
six months &apos; detention ,
three years &apos; probation .
two years &apos; probation , no jail time .
you do know it &apos;s called bargaining , right ?
why am i the only one making concessions ?
i just gave you an extra year on probation .
you &apos;re not giving me anything on detention .
because my client doesn &apos;t deserve it--
he &apos;s a 98 @-@ pound wallflower .
who clocked a classmate with an algebra textbook .
because he was being bullied .
19 stitches , a cracked eye socket .
so what &apos;s someone from stern , lockhart
doing in juvenile court , anyway ?
god &apos;s work .
one of our big clients ; it &apos;s his housekeeper &apos;s son .
let him plead no contest ;
three years probation .
come on .
i make that deal , i &apos;m looking for a job .
no . you have the flexibility to go to zero ,
or you would have made a call .
so your husband told you all our secrets ?
some .
look , my client is a straight @-@ a student .
never had a bad day before , never have a bad day again ,
unless you incarcerate him .
one year probation , 200 hours community service ,
and he takes responsibility in open court .
no &quot; bully did this , i did that . &quot;
thank you .
go and sin no more .
we &apos;ve been watching you .
now , that sounds sinister .
i know how you hate praise , diane ,
so please , forgive us .
what you have done for women ,
through example , encouragement and perseverance ,
is truly unparalleled .
your work on emily &apos;s list ,
your mentoring of young lawyers ,
your shattering of the glass ceiling ...
i have a feeling we &apos;re coming to a very significant &quot; but . &quot;
no , a small one .
but you now have a hard decision to make .
and that is ?
diane ...
we want you to be a judge .
no !
yes .
we &apos;re here as representatives of the democratic ward and committee chairs ,
and we would like to slate you for the upcoming election .
i @-@ i ...
i &apos;m startled .
we need more women judges , diane .
we need better judges .
right now we have two lifeguards for every swimmer--
two judges who understand the law
for everyone who doesn &apos;t--
and we need to maintain that ratio .
well , i hope i &apos;m a lifeguard .
that &apos;s the reason we &apos;re here .
and my firm ?
you &apos;ll have to divest ,
of course .
we don &apos;t do the smoke @-@ filled rooms anymore , diane ,
but we do manage the primary ballot .
so if you agree ,
you &apos;ll be the only woman slated ,
and thus , a shoo @-@ in .
that &apos;s how i became chief justice .
but it means leaving all this behind .
i , um ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
say yes .
can i take a few days ?
you can take a week .
you &apos;ve done well , diane .
claim your prize .
you want terrence to plead guilty ?
i want him to go home--
the plea is just a formality , thalia , that &apos;s all .
and it &apos;s just a minor misdemeanor .
but he &apos;ll have a criminal record .
that will be expunged when his probation &apos;s finished .
he &apos;s not a criminal .
i know .
what do you think , terrence ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you think you could go in front of a judge ,
tell him what you did and apologize for it ?
i guess .
i am sorry .
i know .
hey , mom , pick up the phone . hey , mom , pick up the phone .
i @-@ it &apos;s my daughter . i &apos;ll just be a minute .
hi , grace . is everything okay ?
yeah , everything &apos;s good .
so , can shannon come over today ?
who &apos;s shannon ?
she &apos;s a girl in my class .
how old are you ?
13 .
she &apos;s 13 , too .
my mom said i can go .
her mom says it &apos;s okay .
is it all right with jackie ?
yeah , she said it &apos;s fine .
she just wanted me to ask you first .
okay , then ,
uh , just help grandma with any cleanup .
yeah .
oh ... guess what , mom ?
what ?
her dad &apos;s in prison , too .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
six months &apos; probation , a hundred hours &apos; community service .
you &apos;re lucky it &apos;s christmastime , mr. thompson .
defecate again in your neighbor &apos;s closet ,
i won &apos;t be so jolly .
and who &apos;s our next contestant , danny ?
terrence ramsay , your honor .
young master , terrence ramsay .
where are his glasses ?
oh , he &apos;s fine without them .
no , just , can i have them ?
where &apos;s your counselor , young man ?
here , your honor .
oh , good ! shall we all gather around the campfire here , counselor ?
i understand you &apos;ve reached a plea agreement , mr. richardson ?
yes , your honor .
mr. ramsay has agreed to plead guilty to simple assault .
is that correct , mr. ramsay ?
you &apos;re ready to plead guilty ?
yes , sir .
mr. ramsay , you understand that you have the right ...
is there a problem , counselor ?
no , your honor .
does mr. ramsay need his glasses to see me ?
ms ... ?
florrick , your honor .
florrick .
well , we &apos;re in for a treat today , aren &apos;t we , danny ?
some good old florrick magic .
why don &apos;t you take off those glasses and put them in your pocket , son .
to the charge of simple assault ,
how do you plead , mr. ramsay ?
guilty , your honor .
and in your own words , why don &apos;t you tell us what happened ?
at lunch , reggie said he was gonna beat me up after school .
he called me a little bitch .
a @-@ and he said he was gonna break my glasses .
he scared me , and i threw my book at him .
and the state &apos;s recommendation ?
one year probation and 200 hours of community service .
you caused some serious injuries , mr. ramsay .
broken eye socket , stitches ...
the other child is recovering quite well , your honor .
break a nose ,
and your punishment is picking up trash ?
what &apos;s the lesson there ?
your honor , i would just like to say--
the agreement that you have , mr. ramsay ,
is between you and the government ,
and as such , i am not party to that agreement
and can impose a harsher sentence .
do you understand that ?
mr. ramsay ...
i am sentencing you to nine months &apos; detention .
you will receive the guidance you need to become a productive citizen ,
and come to understand that actions have consequences .
no , your honor ...
this will be the best thing for you , i promise .
your honor , i &apos;m sorry but we have an agreement . no jail time .
next contestant .
no , wait !
mom !
terrence ?
what the hell is going on here ?
young master , marcus tansen .
mom !
terrence ?
this where you come to celebrate ?
your boss wanted six months .
you got nine .
florrick is not the most popular name around here .
oh , that is not what this is about .
that was a bait @-@ and @-@ switch .
oh , come on .
a judge has indigestion , you get six months ;
he has a good meal , someone goes free .
it balances itself out .
not for terrence ramsay .
then what do you want to do ?
you act like this isn &apos;t the water we &apos;re both swimming in ?
baxter is well @-@ liked ,
but he &apos;s all over the map with sentencing .
someone just complained last week .
you think your kid got screwed ,
talk to howard brightman at legal aid .
that &apos;s not the entrance .
i think that &apos;s for the guards .
so , how often do you go ?
to see my dad ?
every month .
it &apos;s far .
what &apos;s yours ?
tamms minimum .
so , what &apos;d your dad do ?
nothing .
i mean , he says he didn &apos;t ,
but they say he sold drugs .
crystal .
wow . that &apos;s not bad .
so , what did he say happened ?
he was set up .
yeah , my dad , too .
i think your dad &apos;s prison is nicer than mine .
thought i &apos;d make some snacks for you young ladies .
what are we looking at here ?
nothing . thanks , grandma .
we &apos;re comparing prisons .
i don &apos;t understand .
shannon &apos;s joking .
we &apos;re fine . thanks .
so , shannon , is your mother picking you up ?
no . i have my bike .
your bike ? where do you live ?
garfield park , on lake .
i think i should phone your mother .
no . we &apos;re fine .
thanks , grandma .
we have to do homework now . bye .
so she &apos;s the one who took you there ?
it &apos;s like she thinks he &apos;s staying at a country club .
not a good one .
definitely not .
thanks for agreeing to meet , mr. brightman .
howie .
so , do you always put out a buffet like that ?
oh , would you like something ?
a muffin or something ?
no , no . i &apos;m fine .
so , yeah , um ...
you &apos;re interested in my client , damien harkin ?
kid stole a chicken from costco .
richardson agreed to
a plea of simple theft , and supervised release ,
but judge baxter gave him nine months .
and you filed a motion to reconsider .
you bet i did .
baxter denied it .
on what grounds ?
sentence within guidelines ,
judicial discretion .
so , every day , they just put out all that food ?
every day .
why don &apos;t you ...
no , no . i had lunch .
baxter is a bipolar sentencer ,
but nobody wants to confront him because we all gotta go back there .
you &apos;re looking to file a motion to reconsider ?
i am .
last year , we started segregating cases by judges .
these are all baxter cases .
maybe i &apos;ll just grab one .
please .
yes .
your honor .
it &apos;s not a given .
sure it is .
cook county democrats say you &apos;re a judge , you &apos;re a judge .
vote &apos;s a formality .
so you think i should .
i think you &apos;d be crazy not to .
these chances don &apos;t come along every day .
and the firm ?
we survived losing stern .
we &apos;ll ... survive losing you .
and my people ?
your people ?
the lawyers who came over with me .
that &apos;s funny ,
i thought they were our people .
isn &apos;t that what we said the first day-- no fiefdoms ?
we also said we wouldn &apos;t stab each other in the back .
oh , and we didn &apos;t .
stern left of his own free will .
just promise me you won &apos;t clean house .
diane ...
if it were the reverse ,
would you promise me ?
congratulations , diane .
so , aren &apos;t you lead attorney on sheffrin @-@ marks ?
why are we doing this ?
this is sheffrin @-@ marks . well , sheffrin , anyway .
he asked us to take care of his housekeeper &apos;s kid
and alicia promptly went out and got him locked up .
sorry .
these are all from legal aid .
baxter &apos;s cases .
on this side , everybody got probation .
on that , jail time .
so you &apos;re filing a motion to reconsider , based on what ?
he &apos;s a racist .
i &apos;d take this up to will , get his advice .
no . you &apos;re barking up the wrong tree .
baxter &apos;s old @-@ school liberal ,
million man march , all that .
and , of course , liberals can &apos;t be racists .
hey , i &apos;m just ...
20 cases doesn &apos;t mean anything .
we need to know the race of everyone else baxter sentenced ,
and then do a regression analysis
to look at other variables that could explain the pattern .
so , kalinda , you , uh , help alicia with the hard data for her motion ,
and use mr. statistics here .
he has nothing better to do .
who says i got nothing better to do ?
i do .
hey , one thing . i wouldn &apos;t go to will .
why ?
he &apos;s best buds with baxter .
how do you know ?
i researched all the partners .
didn &apos;t you ?
thanks .
i could be wrong . it &apos;s a small sampling .
get a larger one .
so you think i should pursue the biased sentencing charge ?
what else do you have ?
mitigation . or withdraw the plea .
argue that baxter didn &apos;t properly moniter terrence .
maybe on an appeal .
but you have to get back to baxter with this motion .
when illinois still had the death penalty ,
juries were ten times more likely
to sentence an african @-@ american than a white one .
i challenged three death sentences with that argument .
and did it work ?
twice .
judges should know they can &apos;t get away with bias in sentencing .
but i don &apos;t want to fight a cause
at the expense of a client .
you won &apos;t .
get a larger sampling .
don &apos;t make your argument specific to baxter .
throw in a few other judges , too .
if baxter is smart ,
he &apos;ll read between the lines and reconsider .
you know judge baxter is a friend of will &apos;s ?
i don &apos;t see the relevance .
this isn &apos;t personal .
a judge &apos;s job is to be an impartial arbiter .
two lifeguards to every swimmer .
if baxter fails , it &apos;s in everybody &apos;s interest
to make that known .
thank you .
no problem .
you should knock on my door more often , alicia .
i will .
you &apos;re doing a good job .
my apologies if i haven &apos;t told you that until now .
thank you .
her name is shannon . she rode her bike here .
she wouldn &apos;t let me phone her mother .
well , i @-@ i just think she &apos;s a little mature for grace .
her father &apos;s in prison , you know .
jackie , your son &apos;s in prison .
well , yes , but he &apos;s not in statesville .
what ?
i wish i could laugh about it .
i &apos;m not laughing about it .
i &apos;m laughing about you .
oh , well , yes , that would be me-- figure of fun .
look , i &apos;m just glad that grace has a friend .
she &apos;s been slow to make friends at school .
then let me introduce her to some friends at the dlc .
oh , no , jackie , not the debutante stuff .
well , it &apos;s not the way it used to be .
you know , there are black cotillions ,
mexican cotillions ;
the girls work in soup kitchens .
jackie , why ...
why don &apos;t we just let gracie pick her own friends , okay ?
have you even asked grace
what her friend &apos;s father is in prison for ?
d @-@ don &apos;t you think we should at least find that out ?
what if it &apos;s something bad ?
what if it is ?
she &apos;s not her father .
much as i hate to admit it ,
stat boy may have something .
we looked at all the kids
baxter sent to detention , sorted by date .
the racial pattern didn &apos;t exist before--
the racial pattern didn &apos;t exist before june 2008 .
why ?
i still don &apos;t know if it &apos;s racism or if it &apos;s something else .
do you want to talk to her ?
nah .
look , we don &apos;t know ,
but something in june changed for baxter .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
can you find out ?
went for it , huh ?
i had to .
it &apos;s a beautiful day today , isn &apos;t it , danny ?
so let &apos;s all take a short break , shall we ?
everybody get some sunshine .
counselor-- in chambers .
not you , mr. richards .
have some birthday cake ?
no , thank you , your honor .
happy birthday .
it &apos;s not mine . court reporter .
so ...
i &apos;m biased against african @-@ americans , huh ?
your honor , we looked at five years of statistics ...
who &apos;s that ?
president obama ,
senator burris ...
i don &apos;t think i need to take lessons from you , ma &apos;am .
i didn &apos;t think i was trying to teach you any--
what was your husband &apos;s record on racial issues ?
i mean , before he went to prison ?
your honor , this isn &apos;t about my husband .
you &apos;re damn right it &apos;s not ; it &apos;s about me .
you sentenced terrence ramsay too harsh--
do not interrupt me !
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m a lawyer in your court , sir .
i &apos;m a lawyer who filed a motion to ...
did you consider the education of the defendant
in your little statistical jeremiad ?
did you consider family structure ,
community services , quality of representation ?
no .
you went right to race , didn &apos;t you ?
my motion didn &apos;t single you out , sir .
and how clever was that ?
nice one . warning shot .
send mr. ramsay home or else .
that &apos;s not what i was trying to do .
i was trying to point out a pattern that you might not be aware of .
look . here &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t respond well to being threatened ,
mrs. florrick ,
so why don &apos;t you withdraw this motion
before it becomes a part of the record ?
withdraw it .
are we understood ?
we &apos;re understood .
all your cell phones . come on , let &apos;s go .
i didn &apos;t even know alicia had a case before you .
pretty sure she doesn &apos;t anymore .
guess he &apos;s back already for another lesson .
how &apos;s his honor today ?
his honor &apos;s getting ready to skywalk your ass .
how they treating you in kiddie court ?
they love me .
there you go , judge .
so how long &apos;s she been at the firm ?
a few months .
what &apos;s the case ?
run of the mill .
of course , she treated it like a matter for the supreme court--
precedents from death row appeals ,
constitutional references on every page .
you know , rookie mistakes .
her heart &apos;s in the right place . she &apos;ll get there .
her heart &apos;s in the right place ? !
that used to be the quickest way to get fired from your firm .
are you sleeping with her ?
fingers crossed that florrick loses his appeal ?
nope .
you look serious .
just not sleeping with her .
not even a little bit ?
not even in your head ?
about this case ?
do your girlfriend a favor .
tell her to move on .
what happened ?
they called . they said terrence got hurt .
now they won &apos;t let me see him .
visiting hours are over , ma &apos;am .
her son got hurt .
yeah-- she can come back tomorrow .
she works and it &apos;s an hour &apos;s drive .
could you make an exception ?
no visitors , except between 11 and 2 .
could i speak to your supervisor ?
sure .
he &apos;ll be in at 9 , tomorrow .
i let him keep the lights on at home .
he &apos;s scared of the dark .
you think they let him keep a light on in there ?
i don &apos;t know .
i baby him too much .
no matter how old ,
they &apos;re always our babies .
i hoped he wouldn &apos;t have to face things like this .
just thought if i watched him real close ...
so , what &apos;s this ?
baxter &apos;s old house . i &apos;m meeting a friend .
so don &apos;t talk , all right ?
i used to work with this guy .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
don &apos;t move an inch .
hey , frank .
kay .
you bring a friend ?
i come in peace .
colleague . not my decision .
what &apos;s your beef with judge baxter ?
i don &apos;t think i have one .
then why &apos;d you want to meet ?
i came across a crime report with your name on it .
you mind walking me through it , frank ?
burglar broke in here .
back window . flipped the lock .
the judge wasn &apos;t home . only his wife .
no warning from the security system ?
and what did the guy want ?
mrs. baxter said it was robbery .
said ?
she was pretty shaken up .
she had a cut on her cheek ,
wrist looked like somebody had been handling her .
rape .
why lie about being raped ?
cary , want to go and sit in the car ?
i couldn &apos;t find a case file in the s.a. &apos; s office .
you never caught the guy .
bad description ?
no , good description .
his honor phoned later .
said his wife just wanted to drop it .
she happen to mention the race of the perp ?
yeah . african @-@ american .
why ?
and this happened in the summer of 2008 .
yep .
june .
i don &apos;t believe it .
people aren &apos;t that simple .
people are exactly that simple .
before the assault ,
baxter &apos;s sentencing is race @-@ neutral .
after , it &apos;s not .
yeah , but that could be anything .
people do things for a hundred reasons .
no , people like to think they do
they do things for one reason .
for what reason ?
come on , yoda-- what reason ?
sex , money , hatred , love .
you want to make people mysterious .
people aren &apos;t mysterious .
okay , then the same thing goes for you .
you &apos;re not mysterious .
by the same logic , you &apos;re completely knowable .
sure .
okay , so then hit me .
i want to know .
go ahead .
cary
you and i have nothing in common
&apos;cause you and i are from different worlds .
and it &apos;s not just mars and venus ,
it &apos;s spaghetti and hydrogen .
we &apos;re different categories .
i &apos;m knowable , but just not to you .
i just want things to be normal .
everybody else &apos;s dads are normal .
maybe nothing &apos;s normal .
i mean ,
maybe we decide what &apos;s normal .
you and me ?
yeah !
okay , what do you want to be normal ?
oh , i don &apos;t know-- eating dessert for breakfast ?
okay , that &apos;s normal now .
no school on thursdays .
no mondays .
those are really bad .
living in chicago is abnormal .
yeah , really abnormal .
hi , i &apos;m shannon &apos;s mother .
oh , hello .
nice to meet you .
i just ... um ... i &apos;m sorry .
i need to take shannon home now .
oh , i &apos;m glad you came .
i was worried about shannon riding her bike home .
please come in .
actually , no , i can &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
we have to ...
we &apos;re in a bit of a rush .
grace ...
shannon , your mother &apos;s here !
so you live in garfield park .
yes .
yeah ? what ?
&quot; yes , &quot; what .
shannon &apos;s mother &apos;s here .
hey , mom . uh , this is grace .
hi . i &apos;m sorry .
we have to go .
do you have your homework ?
see you tomorrow .
bye .
what &apos;d you say to her ?
nothing .
baxter should have disclosed this .
they arrested a guy
who fit the description mrs. baxter gave them ,
but she wouldn &apos;t come in to i.d.
wasn &apos;t up to it .
baxter asked them to let it go .
what can i do with this ?
not much .
judges are human .
it &apos;s like alan dershowitz .
before 9 / 11 , he believed police coercion was unconstitutional .
after 9 / 11 , he argued for torture .
how &apos;s your kid doing ?
my kid ?
oh , terrence .
fractured arm , some bruises .
he &apos;s recovering .
he &apos;s still in the infirmary ?
he goes back in the general population in two days .
not a lot of time to work with .
the way i see it , it doesn &apos;t make sense
to go back to baxter with the same motion .
we should try to take the cases away from him .
file a motion to substitute for cause .
let me try a more direct route .
and sheffrin @-@ marks-- that &apos;s your client or will &apos;s ?
both of ours .
but he brought it in .
uh , yes . why ?
we would rather it not be you .
it doesn &apos;t look good
representing a pharmaceutical company
against 300 working @-@ class plaintiffs .
and your name , &quot; lockhart . &quot;
that &apos;s an english name ?
we don &apos;t need to bring that up now .
what &apos;s wrong with my name ?
well , the electorate is 19 % irish .
they go for an irish name .
i know-- the things we have to think about .
i think a speech
to the irish @-@ american heritage center handles the problem .
could you give us a minute ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
do you know a henry baxter ?
yes .
juvenile court ?
yes , i know .
you have a junior associate accusing him of racism .
no-- biased sentencing .
i &apos;m glad you brought this up , diane .
that &apos;s what i like about you--
very direct .
i was gonna talk to you about it .
you need to talk to her .
who ?
your junior associate .
ask her to apologize to baxter .
you &apos;re kidding .
no .
you said you wanted to get rid of the swimmers .
more lifeguards .
yes .
baxter is a lifeguard .
i ... but he acts in contravention to the law .
well , that &apos;s a matter of opinion .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s a fact .
judges don &apos;t go up against each other , diane .
you can &apos;t question a sitting judge .
yes , but you can .
you &apos;re the chief justice .
i want to know that you &apos;re serious about running , diane .
i &apos;ve told you i am .
yes .
now you have to act like you are .
talk to your junior associate .
it &apos;s one kid sentenced-- that &apos;s all .
don &apos;t turn over the apple cart because of one kid .
no continuance .
excuse me , your honor ?
i said no continuance . we &apos;re going to trial .
your honor , i ...
the plaintiff has acquiesced to our request .
yes , and the bench has not .
what is so hard to understand here , mr. gardner ?
you asked for a continuance , i said no .
next motion .
that , young sir , is called a tax .
you complained about baxter to the chief justice ?
yes .
what is this ?
some last parting gift to the firm ?
baxter &apos;s wife was assaulted ,
and he &apos;s been sentencing from his bias ever since .
you don &apos;t know that .
you don &apos;t know why anybody decides anything .
i have eyes .
and you &apos;d have them , too , if he weren &apos;t a friend .
and what ? seriously , what ?
you gonna recall a judge ?
let &apos;s figure out how that works
cause i &apos;d love to see that plan .
anybody can fight city hall .
what they can &apos;t fight are judges .
there &apos;s a kid in prison right now .
come on , diane .
you don &apos;t even know his name .
this stopped being about a kid a while ago .
grace ?
where &apos;s shannon ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought she was coming home with you .
yeah , i thought so , too .
but i guess whatever you told her mom worked .
i @-@ i never said anything to her mom .
we met yesterday .
i &apos;m jackie , grace &apos;s grandmother .
i &apos;m here to pick up grace .
she &apos;s not here .
really ?
she said she &apos;d be coming here right after school--
her best friend &apos;s house .
mom ?
it &apos;s okay , shannon .
what do you want ?
i want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
i don &apos;t need to talk to you .
you &apos;re wasting water .
you should turn that off .
get off my property .
your husband is in a much worse prison than my son .
we should be worried about you , not you us .
okay , you want to know why ?
because your son put my husband in prison .
he did not .
he was the state &apos;s attorney .
my husband never sold a drug a day in his life ,
and your son put him in prison for ten years for something he didn &apos;t do .
you &apos;re a very gullible woman .
and you &apos;re a bitch !
my son is an honorable man .
if he put your husband in prison , he deserved it .
go to hell .
leave it alone .
okay .
we got a problem .
really ?
stat boy says we have a problem .
blacks go to detention , whites go home , right ?
question is why .
we know why .
an african american man assaults baxter &apos;s wife ,
he starts meteing out harsher sentences to blacks-- but look--
i analyzed his sentences
using two nonracial factors .
first , his family structure .
single parent homes ,
two parent homes .
the racial makeup stays the same .
now , age .
under 14 , over 14 .
the racial makeup-- it &apos;s the same .
there was no change in sentencing in june of 2008 ?
no , there is a change . it was a drastic change .
but it wasn &apos;t because of race .
well , if it wasn &apos;t race , what was it ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m telling you what it &apos;s not ,
i can &apos;t tell you what it is .
so , the assault of baxter &apos;s wife is irrelevant .
to his change in sentencing .
no .
we know it &apos;s relevant because , in june of 2008,
he started handing out harsher sentences .
but we just don &apos;t know why .
we need to talk .
tomorrow . i &apos;m late for lunch .
henry baxter .
no .
everyone out there is pussyfooting around you
because you &apos;re his friend .
i said no .
look , i know you &apos;re my boss
and you can tell me get lost when you want ,
but something happened .
henry is not a racist .
you have any idea what a charge
like that does to somebody in chicago ?
i know he &apos;s not a racist .
but something did happen , will .
he started sentencing more harshly last june .
you &apos;re his best friend .
so help me . what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you suspect .
no .
he borrowed some money , that &apos;s all .
how much ?
about $ 120,000 .
he said he was in a tight spot . gambling .
but he was gonna make it right .
did he pay it back ?
some .
say anything about an enforcer visiting his house ?
a bookie &apos;s enforcer ?
no . why ?
that &apos;s why he dropped the charges .
it wasn &apos;t rape , he knew the attacker .
what ?
damn .
what ?
so you have a client who might be sent here ?
yeah . he &apos;s in juvenile court right now ,
but his family &apos;s really worried .
well , first of all , i &apos;m sorry .
and second , we &apos;re a private facility .
all we do is handle the overflow of juveniles sentenced to cook county .
so we are very safe here .
one guard to every 20 inmates .
oh , thank goodness .
then they pay you .
the county does .
yes .
for every juvenile , we get a stipend .
that &apos;s how it works .
and how do you know henry baxter ?
judge baxter ?
yes . he &apos;s a friend .
you guys met , right ?
sorry , he told me , but i forgot .
through our wives .
you know ellen ?
yes .
wonderful tennis player .
yes .
we went sailing .
last june ?
around there .
oh , will you excuse me ?
this way to the exit .
so is that when you arranged the kickbacks ?
the ... ?
the money you gave henry for sending kids to you .
whose idea was it ,
yours or his ?
officer michael , could you show these two out ?
come on , was it yours or his ? !
you better start looking for a good defense attorney , pal !
you look good in action .
how does this happen ?
it happens .
so what &apos;s the solution ?
don &apos;t trust anybody ?
works for me .
okay , what &apos;d i do now ?
just give me an explanation , henry .
even a half @-@ ass one will do .
okay ...
thought we were working the zone defense .
spent the morning with your ex .
ellen .
really .
so how &apos;s she doing ?
i asked her about your gambling .
so what is this , an intervention ?
no ; i wish we had done that a year ago .
people are filling your head with nonsense , will .
what nonsense ?
like you being in debt ,
your sudden interest in sending kids
to palgrave academy ?
you , my friend , are in thrall to your junior associate .
she wandered out on some wild tangent ,
and now you &apos;re following her out there ?
how much does palgrave pay you per kid ? how much ?
ellen doesn &apos;t know what the hell she &apos;s talking about .
okay ? she &apos;s ill .
you know that , will .
did you even just say the words to yourself to see how they sounded ?
&quot; i &apos;m sending kids to prison to make money . &quot;
it &apos;s not even about doing good .
nobody here is helping orphans , but this ,
how can you even live a day with this ?
palgrave is a good place for rehabilitation .
these kids are better off there .
come on .
how bad do you have to behave before you start acknowledging it .
don &apos;t you dare judge me .
you ...
the litigator who whored himself out to the lowest scum .
don &apos;t you dare judge me .
you &apos;re going to jail .
what ? !
your grandmother &apos;s crazy .
i told you .
my mother was gonna sue .
i thought you weren &apos;t supposed to be talking to me .
so ... let &apos;s not talk .
i won &apos;t if you won &apos;t .
so does your mom know your grandma &apos;s crazy ?
she suspects it but ...
wait , so , what did your mom do ?
well , she freaked out , like , off the wall .
she , like , came into the house , head @-@ to @-@ toe soaking wet ,
like as if she , like , took a bath and like , went for a swim .
i &apos;m so sorry !
how you doing , terrence ?
i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;m chief justice adler .
yes , i &apos;m thalia ramsay .
and this must be terrence .
yes , ma &apos;am .
that judge worked for me , terrence .
i share responsibility for what he did .
i &apos;m very sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
thank you .
you don &apos;t know how much this ...
it &apos;s proving more difficult to overcome than we &apos;d like .
my english surname .
well , that never helps .
but your client roster .
i &apos;m sorry .
i could still run .
yes , you could .
we &apos;d send in a ringer to undercut your support .
it wouldn &apos;t be pretty .
might still be fun .
better to wait .
let us see how you do here the next few years .
try not to cause any more ripples .
you &apos;re filled with water metaphors , aren &apos;t you ?
again ...
i &apos;m sorry this didn &apos;t work out .
was that the kiss @-@ off ?
yep .
how &apos;d you handle it ?
with grace and a hint of anger .
i always liked that about you .
his name was terrence .
who ?
the kid .
terrence ramsay .
he &apos;s home with his mother now .
