gossip girl here-- your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; says your dad is dating
serena van der woodsen . is it true ?
not for long .
this isn &apos;t fashion @-@ forward or provocative .
it &apos;s exploitation , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
nelly yuki trashed me in &quot; women &apos;s wear daily . &quot;
&quot; can blair waldorf step into her mother &apos;s shoes ,
or is her achilles &apos; heel of the stripper variety . &quot;
it &apos;s jean pierre . your mother knows
you don &apos;t have orders from any buyers .
did this really happen-- you and serena ?
every dirty detail .
did you write about that night that we were together at the campbell apartment ?
relax . i didn &apos;t publish any of that .
last year , when you had no one , i was there for you .
i kinda need you to do the same for me right now .
make yourself at home .
when it comes to ivy , you &apos;re way out of line .
she &apos;s a known con artist .
she swindled lily and her entire family .
you need to stop sticking your nose in where it doesn &apos;t belong .
he didn &apos;t fake his death for lily or me .
he did it so he could avoid federal prison .
new day , new debs ...
all dressed up to enter high society .
but one fashion faux pas ,
and the dressing down will last a lifetime .
why are you still chewing ? tell me what you think .
i think , um , it &apos;s old school , not in the good way .
in the--in the literal way ,
like what old ladies used to wear to school .
well , it &apos;s traditional , as am i.
i need to remind the world that i am not
the hypersexual heathen nelly yuki labeled me .
there &apos;s traditional , and there &apos;s missionary ,
which does not work for the dress ...
or you , as i recall .
being polite does not make me a prude .
so why fight your raunchy reputation ?
shock value is what got my &quot; inside out &quot; serial attention .
well , my audience was titillated
when sage stripped down to her skivvies .
go . get out of here with your high neckline
and low hemline . go !
i have a new vision , and i need a new muse .
and i suggest you replace your muse .
don &apos;t let her touch anything .
do you know how many hours i &apos;ve spent searching for you ?
i hate it when you play hard @-@ to @-@ get .
are the pancakes okay ?
you can tell me if you don &apos;t like my cooking .
no , your-- your cooking &apos;s great .
i just forgot they were there .
uh , like me ? you &apos;ve barely said a word to me all week .
sorry .
i love them-- you and the pancakes .
i &apos;m getting my cotillion dress refitted .
i lost weight without even trying .
oh , you &apos;re-- you &apos;re coming out tonight ?
no one calls it that anymore .
well , it &apos;s still exciting .
let me know if you need help with your presentation speech
or--or any of the dance steps .
my cotillion ended up being one of the best nights of my life ,
and i &apos;m sure yours will be , too .
all this gushing--
it seems like someone &apos;s angling for an invitation .
no , i don &apos;t expect to be invited .
cotillion is for a girl and her family .
it is .
uh , but no .
not just family . i mean ...
not family in the strictest legal sense .
i @-@ i meant to invite you .
it must have just slipped my mind .
so much for being the only teenager on my father &apos;s arm tonight .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;d love for you to be there tonight
if it &apos;s not too late .
it &apos;s never too late for cotillion .
good , then i &apos;ll see you there .
staying in this room
is transforming you into its previous occupant--
a diva who ignores my calls and has no work ethic .
come on . you know that second part is not true .
what do you want ?
i &apos;ve come to wrestle the blair chapter from your hot little hands .
i haven &apos;t finished it yet .
you &apos;re lying .
you &apos;re here in some desperate attempt to regain blair &apos;s love ,
but you know when she reads what you wrote about her ,
she &apos;s gonna hate you forever .
listen , i can &apos;t hold the magazine off any longer .
hand it over .
what language do i need to say it in for you to understand ?
it &apos;s not done .
i speak five ,
and in every one , that sentence translates to &quot; bullcrap . &quot;
you have until noon to turn it in .
do you know where miss blair went ?
uh , she forgot to put on lucky charm this morning
when she get out of shower .
she think conditioner dulls diamond .
that lucky charm looks a lot like an engagement ring .
no , uh ...
is engagement ring on necklace .
at least until mr. chuck defeats bad dad .
miss blair never leave home without it .
i need to prepare for mad mood .
hi . uh , this is dan humphrey .
yeah . yeah , you can send a messenger to pick up my next chapter .
no , it &apos;s not about blair waldorf .
the one i &apos;m sending is about chuck bass .
well , nate won &apos;t publish any more stories about lily
in &quot; the spectator . &quot;
well , i &apos;d give them to gossip girl if i had them ,
but rufus burned my stash of secrets .
but don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll find something .
we &apos;ll leave her with no one .
so why do we even pay the instructors ?
i &apos;ll call you later .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i need to meet the contractor at the gallery .
he called and said a pipe burst and now the floors are ruined .
well , hopefully he &apos;s exaggerating .
contractors are always looking for ways to make more money .
well , i don &apos;t have any more . it &apos;s all in the gallery .
and i can &apos;t open without floors .
you wanna come ?
i would , but i have an appointment uptown .
okay .
shouldn &apos;t you be with the fbi ,
having bart arrested for illegal oil trading ?
they need evidence first .
the sheikh was the only guy who had any ,
and he &apos;s loyal to his dad .
bart &apos;s been too careful
to leave any trace of the transactions on the books .
i mean , it &apos;s pretty easy to fake numbers .
you speaking from personal experience ?
i &apos;m referring to your father .
right . i mean , he got caught ,
but a lot of people do a little creative accounting
to get past a rough patch and never do .
i &apos;m sure every hedge fund manager behind bars
与金融组织结合后以高风险投机为手段并以盈利为目的的金融基金 。
is telling himself the same thing .
all i &apos;m saying is that
bart had to keep track of his finances somewhere .
if it wasn &apos;t in his business accounts ,
it was in his personal ones .
you &apos;re right .
and hopefully , with lily &apos;s help , we &apos;ll be able to get them .
did you instigate a formal dress code at &quot; the spectator &quot; ?
i gotta drop it off at the cleaners
before i take sage to cotillion tonight .
right.i hope your third time coming out is finally a charm .
serena .
hey , chuck .
bye , chuck .
no , just go ahead and help yourself .
don &apos;t even mention what you &apos;re doing here or , you know ...
i need a male &apos;s perspective on steven .
he &apos;s barely spoken to me all week ,
and then i don &apos;t even think he was gonna tell me about cotillion
until sage accidentally mentioned it .
i ...
has she said anything ?
her dad doesn &apos;t normally come up
in most of our conversations .
could the weirdness be that
steven hooked up with your mom in a dungeon
when you were in grade school ?
no . once he actually remembered that that happened ,
it wasn &apos;t weird at all .
he got over it really quickly . the awkwardness started after .
and i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m supposed to fix the problem
if i don &apos;t even know what the problem is .
see , this is where my female advice skills fall short .
most of my exes would just steal my phone
or go through all my e @-@ mails .
that was a joke .
i know .
lily . there you are .
charles , what are you doing here ?
bart left specific instructions with vanya
not to let me into the apartment ,
but he did let slip that you were shopping on madison .
i should get home .
lily , please , i need your help .
last time i tried to help you ,
you manipulated me against your father .
bart asked me not to speak with you
until you stop attacking our relationship .
you could get me the proof .
don &apos;t you wanna know the real reason he faked his death ?
look , i &apos;m sorry , charles .
i hope you make peace with your father soon
so we can be a family again .
maybe i can help instead .
did someone order a wedding cake ?
if you &apos;re talking about my dress ,
tom used vintage lace from paris .
vintage as in &quot; old &quot; and &quot; used &quot;
lucky for you , i have the hottest new line
to save your sartorial debut .
why would you want me anywhere near your clothes
after i left them on the runway at your fashion show ?
like it or not , your stunt branded me a provocateur ,
so i &apos;m embracing it .
the words i read were &quot; distasteful &quot; and &quot; majorly sluttish . &quot;
semantics .
now i know you love to make a statement ,
so drop the prom poof and let &apos;s go .
no , thanks .
i make a statement in whatever i wear ,
and tonight , it won &apos;t be waldorf .
serena ?
what are you doing ?
i just needed to write some e @-@ mails ,
so i was gonna borrow your dad &apos;s computer ,
but then i decided that i should use mine from home .
must be some pretty thrilling correspondence .
no . no ,
i am just so excited for you and your cotillion tonight .
i &apos;ll see you there .
they say a diamond is forever ,
or maybe never .
it just depends on who finds it first .
why would i want the help of a con artist
and a probable sociopath ?
i &apos;m neither of those things ,
and even if i were , we have a mutual interest in this case .
what are your interests specifically ?
to get lily to leave me alone .
may i suggest you stop following her around in cabs ?
i was trying to find dirt .
i figured , you know , if i caused trouble in her relationship ,
she &apos;d stay out of mine .
while i can &apos;t deny my desire for marital discord ,
i won &apos;t hurt lily .
you don &apos;t have to .
all you have to do to get your
daddy &apos;s panties in a bunch is talk to her .
and as you just witnessed , she doesn &apos;t want to talk to me .
bart doesn &apos;t know that .
so what , make it seem like we &apos;ve been communicating ?
plant some evidence at the apartment ?
it might work , except bart has banned me from the building .
i wasn &apos;t banned .
and i ...
saved a key card .
please tell me this is an inappropriate gift for my debut
and not an engagement ring for serena .
a gift ? no , it is not .
dad , stop talking like yoda .
it &apos;s an engagement ring .
god , it &apos;s a relief to talk about it .
i &apos;ve been so nervous , i forgot to invite serena to cotillion .
yeah , maybe you were nervous
because she &apos;s way too young , and it &apos;s way too soon .
i get it feels fast ,
but we spent all summer together ,
and i haven &apos;t loved anyone this much since your mother .
we all know how well that turned out .
i &apos;m scared , too ,
but i want serena to know that i &apos;m in this for the long haul
and i &apos;m not cool with her moving in here with you
until we are engaged .
and now that you know , i &apos;m just gonna get lily &apos;s permission
and propose to serena tonight .
screw lily . i &apos;m not giving my permission .
i &apos;m not asking .
hush , jessica .
social ascension is a painful process .
well i mean , i know i look young ,
but do you really think i pass for 16 ?
no . i &apos;ll have dorota find a dermatologist
with some juvederm , stat .
hey , i was in the neighborhood .
i thought you might , uh , enjoy some coffee .
maybe i &apos;d be more believable if dan was my date .
no real deb would ever be caught dead
with an escort from an outer borough .
dominick dunne was from hartford ,
and he was considered high society .
your chuck chapter is my favorite .
thank you .
what , you put out a chuck chapter ?
after i gave you your first decent place to live ?
go . pack your things .
don &apos;t you want to read it before you kick me out ?
i read nate &apos;s chapter , and you were supposed to be his friend .
you hate chuck and everything to do with me in relation to chuck .
that &apos;s not true .
yeah , don &apos;t worry , blair . you &apos;re not even in it .
what ? that &apos;s impossible .
there is no chuck bass chapter without blair waldorf .
there is , while he focuses on his battle with his father ,
which is what the chapter &apos;s about .
dan made him seem like a superhero
single @-@ mindedly fighting evil .
ask chuck if he &apos;s upset about it
when he picks you up for cotillion .
chuck &apos;s not going to cotillion .
oh . oh , that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right . i &apos;m sorry .
i forgot you two can &apos;t be together
until he achieves his goal .
and i achieve mine , which you are distracting me from .
bye , jessica .
okay , bye .
thanks for coming over , darling .
i thought you still might be upset
about my brief dalliance with steven .
oh , well , i definitely wish it never happened ,
but i think if he can forget about it ,
then we should all try , too .
especially since , um ,
i think he might propose to me soon .
oh , i had a feeling . you know , he called me earlier
and said he wanted to meet before cotillion .
he said he had something important to ask me .
oh , my gosh ! he really is doing it .
are--are you sure this is what you want ?
i mean , i never really thought about it ,
but once i saw that ring , i @-@ i literally got butterflies .
well , diamonds seem to have that effect , but ...
you &apos;re just-- you &apos;re still so young and ...
i know , but steven &apos;s not .
he--he &apos;s an adult , and he treats me like one .
and , you know , this is the first honest , healthy relationship
i &apos;ve ever had .
it just doesn &apos;t seem that long ago
that you were in love with dan .
and now that rufus and i aren &apos;t together , well ,
i thought you two might be .
yeah , well , i @-@ i thought that for a little while , too .
but , you know , then dan and i had that huge falling out ,
and i met steven .
mom , you &apos;re gonna say &quot; yes , &quot; right ?
oh , lord knows it doesn &apos;t matter what i say .
you &apos;re gonna do exactly what you wanna do .
oh , thank you .
i should probably go get a manicure
so that my hands look perfect .
absolutely .
i &apos;ll see you at cotillion .
pull it tighter .
we need the illusion of a youthful jawline .
good luck with the old chick .
in some countries , old people are considered beautiful .
mm , not this one .
shouldn &apos;t you be at the waldorf astoria ,
donning that doily dress ?
i just found out my father &apos;s proposing to serena tonight .
that is so exciting !
we &apos;ll all get to be there to witness it .
yes , and be upstaged .
i thought you &apos;d want to stop that from happening ,
in exchange for me wearing your dress , of course .
well , you consider yourself a master manipulator .
why not squash the proposal yourself ?
come on , blair . we all know from &quot; gossip girl &quot;
there &apos;s no one better at taking down serena than you .
that is true , but i would need a 2 @-@ tiered plan ,
some kind of protection .
your generation can &apos;t be trusted with scheming on good faith .
i promise i &apos;ll behave .
just please stop her from marrying my dad .
okay . fine .
i will delay the proposal for tonight ,
and if you keep your promise and i get my buyers ,
then we can discuss ending their engagement plans for good .
oh , do we get to climb fire escapes
and wear stockings on our heads for that part ?
yes , jessica .
go get outfitted and--and wait for my signal .
okay , great . okay .
she &apos;s not actually gonna be wearing ....
no . no . she was just annoying me .
hey ! bring in the dress !
it needs to be refitted .
i sprayed your cologne ,
and i put a copy of bart &apos;s will you gave me on lily &apos;s desk .
he &apos;ll be furious with her if he thinks
we &apos;re conspiring to reclaim his empire .
now fill a glass with scotch .
now drink it .
i wouldn &apos;t leave a drop .
hello ?
who the hell are you ?
blair , what a nice surprise .
hello , lily .
i wish i could say the same about serena &apos;s impending proposal .
has she discussed it with you ?
oh , she has . she seems thrilled .
need i say more ?
serena &apos;s enthusiasm is like the bat signal for bad ideas .
it &apos;s sudden , i know ,
but she does seem happy .
but doesn &apos;t she always
when she &apos;s with a new guy ?
dan , nate ,
colin , ben .
oh , she is a romantic ,
bless her tender heart .
but , lily , you and i are realists .
we need to look after her
because she isn &apos;t capable of looking after herself .
thank you , blair .
i appreciate your input .
bye .
lily . thanks for coming to meet me .
i know it &apos;s old @-@ fashioned ,
but with our ... history
and serena &apos;s father not being a constant--
you want my permission to marry my daughter .
mission accomplished .
how do you know you convinced her ?
all i have to do is subtly suggest serena needs saving ,
and lily jumps into protective mother mode ,
ready to do anything to shield her precious daughter
from another relationship gone wrong .
she even had one guy sent to prison .
well , my dad better not end up in lock up ,
but i hope you &apos;re right about the rest .
i am , and just in case ,
we have your part of the plan as backup .
everything &apos;s in motion .
you can either tell me who you are or you can tell the police .
no , please , no police .
my mother larissa just sent me over
to clean something for mrs. lily .
she &apos;s sick ,
but mrs. lily called and said it was an emergency .
and , uh , that &apos;s what needed cleaning ?
mrs. lily said no one else was supposed to see .
&quot; mrs. lily &quot; doesn &apos;t pay your mother &apos;s salary .
i do .
chuck .
that &apos;ll be all .
wow . you look beautiful .
you &apos;re quite the dapper dan yourself .
unfortunately , jessica &apos;s off somewhere
with pantyhose on her head ,
so she no longer requires an escort .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not gonna ask ,
but i &apos;m not dressed for jessica .
i know chuck &apos;s busy ,
and no one should go to cotillion alone .
well , i suppose i could overlook your upbringing
now that you &apos;re a regular feature in &quot; vanity fair &quot;
计划有变 今晚你不要来了
spotted--
one man leaving harry winston empty @-@ handed .
steven spence walked in with a ring
and left without one .
i wonder what--or who-- he &apos;s returning .
where &apos;s the blair chapter ?
why do you care ?
chuck just posted , and the next chapter &apos;s not due for a week .
maybe to &quot; vanity fair , &quot; but i want it now .
i know you , humphrey .
i &apos;m not gonna let you turn our scathing expose
into a sentimental sonnet
because of your delusional feelings for blair .
why are you so sure that i &apos;m delusional and not determined ?
she did date me .
briefly ,
after she lost her prince and her mind .
and now she wears that adorable engagement ring from chuck
around her neck .
not on her finger .
that shoulder , arm , and torso space
is my window to win her back .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me .
not so fast .
either lose the romance notions ,
or i &apos;ll lose them for you .
where did you get that ?
hmm . serena &apos;s phone .
looks like you two share a nostalgia for long @-@ lost loves .
excuse me . sorry .
i bet she still uses it to get off .
i know i do .
you can &apos;t show that to blair .
unless you want blair to hate you forever
for screwing her best friend
while you two were still together ,
you &apos;ll get me those pages .
i &apos;m doing this for your own good .
there &apos;s no viagra to save a career that &apos;s gone soft .
okay , just give me until midnight .
only because i love &quot; cinderfella . &quot;
oh ! oh ! i &apos;m so sorry ! sorry .
why did i ask a peasant &apos;s advice
on how to dress royalty ?
your shock and amaze plan had better work .
i &apos;m counting on it .
you came .
blair , you look devastating ,
as always .
and , humphrey ,
i see you immortalized me once again in print .
should i be concerned about your level of obsession ?
not at all . i find your battle with your father inspiring .
it &apos;s the stuff myths are made of ,
like zeus and cronus .
it never ends .
until zeus wins and comes to be with hera .
actually , zeus tricked hera into being with him ...
after he raped her .
enough about the gods .
let &apos;s drink .
i &apos;m sorry , blair . i can &apos;t . i &apos;m here to speak with lily .
i &apos;m betting bart will come , too , to confront her .
i &apos;m hoping after that she &apos;ll join my battle against him .
have you seen her ?
no , but go find her and imprison cronus .
the sooner the better .
go find us a prime viewing spot .
i need to speak with sage .
thank you .
serena !
you look lovely .
did you deny steven permission to propose to me ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t exactly phrase it that way .
i did express concern that you might not be ready for marriage .
oh , how would you know ? were you ready all six times you did it ?
look , i &apos;m sorry that you &apos;re upset , serena ,
but i &apos;m not the only one that had misgivings .
i mean , blair called and shared hers as well .
blair has no right to share anything .
we &apos;re not even friends anymore .
you knew how much i wanted this .
i knew you wanted someone ,
but let &apos;s face it , serena .
you don &apos;t have boyfriends . you have life rafts .
that you keep taking from me and--and leaving me to drown .
first you got together with rufus
so that i could never be with dan ,
and now you &apos;re jealous that some man
that doesn &apos;t remember sleeping with you is in love with me .
i &apos;m not gonna let you ruin this .
girls , i need your personal statements .
bunny raburn , i hope you included your ballet photos .
ask my mom . she made it .
thank you , sage .
congratulations on your academic accolades .
which clearly have nothing to do with intelligence .
why is serena here ? i told you to keep her away .
i did what you said .
i used my dad &apos;s phone to uninvite her ,
and i had him take the ring my mom sent me to get resized .
and i had my minions send a picture to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
your plan just sucked .
my plan does not suck .
we &apos;ll just have to come up with a new one .
i already have .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll be shocking in your dress ,
and serena will never be my evil stepmom .
now i have to find my date .
bart.
what a nice surprise . i wasn &apos;t expecting you .
just like you weren &apos;t expecting me to find out
about your secret meeting with chuck ?
ah . i knew you &apos;d be upset .
you know , he tracked me down while i was shopping .
so you invited him back to our apartment
to go through my will ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re referring to .
charles was not in our apartment .
i told him i wasn &apos;t comfortable speaking with him
until he made things right .
stop lying to me , lily .
i caught larissa &apos;s daughter cleaning up after you .
bart , larissa &apos;s daughter is 4 .
then who was the 20 @-@ something blonde i caught
with chuck &apos;s scotch glass ?
ah . let me guess .
5 &apos; 4 , &quot; slim , could pass as serena &apos;s cousin ?
ivy . she &apos;s the same one
that leaked those nasty rumors about me last week .
charles , how could you .
after everything i &apos;ve done to try to make peace ?
i don &apos;t want peace .
i want you to help me make him pay for what he did .
put a silver spoon in your mouth ?
or raise you as a single parent ?
which one do you want to punish me for first , son ?
lily , you have to trust me .
you are aiding and abetting a criminal .
charles , that &apos;s enough .
do you want to end up like ruth madoff ,
losing your son to defend your husband ?
i don &apos;t want to lose anyone , charles ,
but you &apos;re leaving me no choice .
i &apos;m going to get my coat .
what can i say ?
marriage has its privileges .
i &apos;d like to welcome you all
to the dispensary cotillion and debutante ball .
our first debutante
is jillian fremont .
jillian is the daughter of winston and ...
steven .
sorry .
serena ! there you are .
whatever it is , blair , i don &apos;t have time .
i have to try to stop you and my mom
from destroying my proposal .
not destroy ,
just delay long enough for sage to wear my dress .
she really doesn &apos;t want you as a stepmom .
and i only have a month to win back buyers
after you walked out of my fashion show .
oh , so you get to ruin my future to sell dresses ?
yeah , that &apos;s justified .
what difference does it make
if your engagement comes a few days late ,
after i have waldorf designs back on track ?
don &apos;t you get it ?
it &apos;s not coming .
whatever you did made steven return the ring .
you mean that picture on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
sage &apos;s mom sent her a ring as a gift .
he was at harry winston getting it resized .
this was all part of a very well @-@ thought out plan .
it was ?
yes . he still has the ring
because he still wants to marry you .
do you really think so ?
of course .
have you ever met yourself ?
any man who loves serena van der woodsen
would never let lily or anyone else
tell him not to be with her .
you know , when i saw that ring ,
you were the only person i wanted to talk to about it .
well , i would never try to take away your happiness .
well , at least not permanently .
if you love him and it &apos;s meant to be ,
then i want it , too .
unfortunately , kids today are not like we were .
they &apos;re unpredictable and alliance @-@ free .
there is no line they won &apos;t cross .
you know , i thought sage was really starting to like me .
well , you were wrong , and now she &apos;s gone rogue .
she &apos;s come up with a plan of her own that i am scared
is more dastardly than even i can imagine .
you have to warn steven .
i will , right after i tell him
i love him and that i want to marry him .
thank you , b.
now go . i wanna be a bridesmaid .
our next debutante is bunny raburn .
bunny is the daughter of jim and fran raburn .
ticktock .
she &apos;s escorted by tom grand .
bunny began to dance as a toddler ...
hey . how you feeling ?
like i &apos;m waiting for the other shoe to drop .
hey .
oh , there you are .
i &apos;m glad you made it .
so i @-@ i take it you didn &apos;t uninvite me either ?
of course not . what are you talking about ?
well , i know about the engagement ring ,
and i don &apos;t care about my mom &apos;s permission .
neither do i.
our next debutante is sage spence .
you ready for this ?
i can hardly wait .
sage is the daughter of paulette and steven spence .
she &apos;s escorted by nathaniel archibald .
i always knew you could do dirty .
provocative .
we do make a good team .
her love of horseback riding
started on the central park carousel ...
what are you doing ? help me !
ed , black it out !
can we please turn off the screen ?
no ! no !
stop that !
that &apos;s weird . your camera &apos;s on .
uh , no , no , it &apos;s not .
whoa , i think it was recording us , actually .
oh , gosh . maybe i @-@ i ...
blair , i can explain this .
you manipulated me into thinking that it was over
so i would cheat on her .
i said i &apos;d never mention s again .
but what &apos;s a movie without credits ?
why don &apos;t we start the dancing early , huh ?
dancing . dancing would be good .
sage did this . she told blair she had a plan .
what , the same blair who put her in a fashion show half @-@ naked ?
no , sage did that , too .
you cannot let her sabotage our relationship .
excuse me if i don &apos;t take parenting advice
from a woman who recorded herself having sex with her ex
to get revenge on her best friend .
i know that that was wrong .
i was in a really bad place ,
which is why i left town in the first place--
to get a fresh start , which i had with you .
this doesn &apos;t change us .
it changes everything .
so the whole time you refused to speak to me
for choosing chuck ,
you were cheating on me with serena .
it was only once .
and you--you heard the tape . she manipulated me into it .
in order to claim date rape , you have to say &quot; no . &quot;
look , she told me you chose chuck ,
which turns out wasn &apos;t even a lie .
you just didn &apos;t have the decency to tell me yourself .
i intended to ,
but i respected you enough
not to sleep with him until i did .
i thought chuck sleeping with jenny
was the most despicable thing someone could do to me .
but this is worse ,
because you pretended to be better .
at least i ended up with the right person .
you ended up with no one .
chuck will never be finished fighting with his father ,
and that ring around your neck
is never gonna be on your finger .
i would rather be with no one than with you .
what the hell happened to waiting until midnight ?
i was going to .
that little bitch sage stole my phone .
w @-@ what did i-- what did i ever do to her ?
well , from what i &apos;ve heard over debs hurling in the bathroom ,
she wanted to stop her daddy from marrying serena .
the surprise ending for your serial
was just collateral damage .
well , you still got what you wanted .
blair hates me forever .
i &apos;m gonna go get the next chapter .
bring it to me here .
hmm . i forgot how much i love being 16 .
tell me this isn &apos;t your best cotillion ever .
oh , are you kidding me ?
this is worse than when i punched carter baizen .
excuse me , mini me .
my phone ?
oh . is this yours ?
hmm . skip the innocent act .
i admire your way with an antic .
if you &apos;re ever in the need of employment , call me .
wait . you broadcast the sex tape ?
would you want your father to marry serena ?
she &apos;s my friend . you humiliated her .
i didn &apos;t force her to do it for the camera .
i simply reported it ,
like you did with my dad
and lily on &quot; the spectator . &quot;
that &apos;s a newspaper , not a society gala .
and i didn &apos;t do it to hurt them .
you know what ?
you may be legal ,
but this is way too high school for me .
nate ! nate , where are you going ?
we were in the middle of a dance !
ah , that &apos;s great . as long as they &apos;re done for the opening .
thanks .
that sounded positive . are the floors okay ?
they were destroyed ,
but bex told an anonymous collector
about the cole james piece ,
which means now we have the money to replace them .
well , i knew everything would work out .
i &apos;m gonna go clean up so we can celebrate .
and say &quot; thanks &quot; to bex for me , too .
hi . bex , i know you &apos;re not allowed to tell me
who bought the piece ,
uh , but , uh , i &apos;d like to send them an invitation
and , uh , a thank @-@ you note .
a.p.o. box would be great .
wait . are you s-- are you sure it &apos;s 76648 ?
邮箱号码 76648
yep , that &apos;s all i needed . thanks .
i guess we learned
what appalling thing sage had planned .
sage ? you &apos;re the one who &apos;s appalling ,
and a lot of other words
that i should not utter at a society gala .
blair , i @-@ i know that that video was horrible ,
but you had already chosen chuck .
did you know that when you took dan to the campbell apartment
and set up a camera to seduce him for the whole world to see ?
no , it wasn &apos;t like that . a waitress had spilled on us ,
and--and--and so we went to clean up .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you took nate &apos;s virginity on that bar ,
when i loved him .
you just needed to prove
that you could still take anyone i want .
the only one you want is chuck .
i am so sorry , blair .
i made a mistake , but so did you
when you teamed up with sage to try to ruin my proposal .
no .
i stopped when i knew that you could really get hurt ,
but you didn &apos;t .
you crossed the line and kept going .
only because i thought i loved dan , and you didn &apos;t .
you know , serena , i kept hoping
that this was just like all of our other fights ,
and that no matter how much we hated each other ,
we would still always be best friends .
but you were right , what you said before my fashion show .
we haven &apos;t been friends for a long time .
i just couldn &apos;t see it .
we all came into this world naked and alone .
looks like s is leaving it that way , too .
what are you doing ?
you know , going through someone &apos;s mail
is a federal offense .
as is purchasing artwork with stolen funds .
you wanna explain
the bank account with all the zeroes ?
okay .
i didn &apos;t steal it .
lola returned it to me .
that &apos;s carol &apos;s portion of cece &apos;s estate .
that makes sense .
what doesn &apos;t is why you came to me pretending to have nothing ,
when you could buy half of manhattan .
that money alienated me from everyone i cared about .
but i couldn &apos;t do nothing while you lost the gallery .
yeah , but you still should &apos;ve told me .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but my being rich doesn &apos;t change anything between us .
yeah , i &apos;m not so sure about that .
money caused all my problems with lily .
i &apos;d never lord my fortune over your head the way she did .
i mean , this money just ...
means we can be us
and fix broken floors
and go on great trips
and celebrate with fabulous champagne .
i never thought i &apos;d be grateful to cece rhodes .
hey , steven , it &apos;s me . can we meet somewhere to talk , please ?
serena , i have nothing more to say to you .
so that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re just gonna break up with me over sage &apos;s manipulation ?
she was right .
we moved too fast , and you are too young .
no , but that &apos;s not what you said this summer .
you said that we were perfect together .
we were ,
until we got back to your life in new york .
but i didn &apos;t want this life . that &apos;s why i ran away .
it &apos;s still a part of you ,
and my loving you isn &apos;t enough to shut it out .
and i can &apos;t marry someone who always has another sex tape
or hidden agenda or surprise scheme up their sleeve .
i &apos;m a father .
i can &apos;t just think about myself .
steven ...
i &apos;m sorry , serena ,
more than you know .
you take care of yourself .
are you okay ?
not really . are you ?
i &apos;m not sure .
you , uh , you wanna grab a burger ?
and fries .
and a shake .
yeah . why not ?
okay .
blair .
thank you for never sleeping with serena .
the pleasure was all mine .
her sick show with dan is all over &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
well , at least now everyone can see the truth about them .
they can see everything about them .
but i have to say , i didn &apos;t expect this from humphrey .
and though i always wanted you to choose me ,
i always feared he was the better man .
no one &apos;s better for me than you .
then you won &apos;t mind waiting a little longer
for us to be together ?
your plan to have lily help you didn &apos;t work ?
my father has her wrapped around his finger .
i have to find a way to expose him on my own .
you will .
and i will wait as long as it takes .
if that &apos;s what you still want-- to wait .
they say good things come to those who do .
was that you vibrating ?
i should go .
i know it seems like forever ,
but i know what my father did , and i just have to prove it .
when charles said i was aiding and abetting , bart ,
have you done something that would send you to prison ?
i never told you ...
to protect you from exactly these kinds of attacks .
after the mortgage meltdown , bass industries was in trouble .
i knew some people who knew some people ,
and i made a deal to sell some oil from the sudan .
there was an embargo in place which made it illegal ,
and then things got complicated .
was anyone hurt ?
no .
well , that &apos;s all i needed to know .
there &apos;s something to be said for having a partner in crime .
did your dad dump the bitch yet ?
no . but i wondered if you &apos;d seen
bart do anything unusual in the apartment .
maybe the reason he &apos;s so intent on keeping me out
is because what i need &apos;s inside .
mm . well , he did hold on to this envelope the whole time ,
but i didn &apos;t see who it was from .
sorry .
no . you &apos;ve been very helpful . thank you .
sometimes you have no choice but to go it alone .
you know i hate cryptic text messages .
i need to emotionally prepare for a gift or a land mine .
i have both .
well , gift first so i can appreciate it
before i &apos;m blown to smithereens .
jean pierre call
to get pattern for sage sex dress .
he say he already has calls from buyers .
well , then that means that waldorf designs
will be in stores before my mother &apos;s deadline .
what could possibly explode that ?
miss eleanor call , too .
she saw photos of cotillion .
she say she come home to fix decorum disaster .
after all ,
you &apos;re the only one who can answer for your sins .
well , come on , do you think that my mom &apos;s right ,
that steven was just another in my long line of life rafts ?
i don &apos;t know . do you feel like you &apos;re drowning without him ?
we probably both need to learn how to swim .
oh , come on . how is that fair ?
i get dumped over our sex tape ,
and you get girls ?
what can i say ? they like what they saw .
well , they didn &apos;t see your plaid boxers , clearly .
hey , those are my favorites .
i remember , from four years ago .
you want more pie ?
hey , excuse me . sorry to interrupt .
uh , could we get some more--
what do you want , pecan or apple crisp ?
both .
and banana cream ?
thank you .
hey , thanks for being humiliated with me .
once you &apos;ve answered for your sins ,
there &apos;s nothing in the way
of starting a whole new partnership .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
