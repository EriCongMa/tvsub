Kyle Diaz, diagnosed with relapsing
and remitting multiple sclerosis.
Kyle Diaz, you and I are a lot alike.
told him maybe we would go out when he got back from touring,.
and so we've been texting.
"Guitar Hero"?
If Jackson can make a case that April committed fraud,
he's get a shot at getting full custody of that baby.
I think Jackson's gonna sue me.
I tried to take the high road.
Apparently, the high road is paved with restraining orders.
The restraining order was a mistake.
You were my best friend, April.
And we should treat each other the way we did on this paper.
Bailey gave me the Preminger Grant.
I'm gonna be miserable without you.
You can figure it out. You will. You -- You should.
I can totally go with her.
You'll be able to see Sofia whenever you want.
My ex-wife wants to move
across the country and take our daughter.
It's a six-month suspension from the Residency Program.
I tried to save her. They know that, right?
I wanted to fire you. I was talked down.
Well, I am sorry I disappoint you.
That's all, Dr. Warren.
Surgeons are often evaluated on speed and efficiency.
Did you brush all of them?
Yes.
Let me see.
But that doesn't mean faster is always better.
Good girl. Keep brushing.
Maggie, where's -- - We're here. Found them.
Where?
They were under my pillow.
Someone crawled into bed with me last night.
Who's crawling into whose bed? Is DeLuca here?
Definitely not.
It's the wrong foot.
You jump the gun,
you risk making a wrong diagnosis.
You know we're becoming like cat ladies,
and the children are our cats.
I'm not a cat lady just because I stopped having se--
Read the room.
Yeah. S-E-X with DeLuca.
We don't always have the time to think before we act.
Mommy.
Yes?
Why did Aunt Maggie stop having S-E-X with DeLuca?
Because he couldn't handle that she was his B-O-S-S.
Do not ever date a man who can't handle your P-O-W-E-R.
Okay.
They just pick up everything.
Got 'em all.
Good job.
And that's what gets us in trouble.
I can't stand it.
I mean, the other day, I was sitting in a coffee place,
and I thought, "Yeah, I can be a barista."
Why not? I was an anesthesiologist for years.
Now I just wake people up for a living.
Less-than-lateral move, don't you think?
Well, I got to do something. I'm going stir crazy.
I'm falling so far behind,
I'm losing so much O.R.time...
You have more experience than any of the other residents.
Don't panic. You're already ahead.
It's funny, actually.
You've been a doctor longer than any of them.
Been a doctor longer than me.
How is that funny?
It's not.
Yeah, it's really not.
God, that coffee sounds really good right now, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Yes.
Did you see what happened in the paper?
No. But you were right about it.
Sorry. I'm here, I'm here.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No.
Did you want to order?
No, I'm good. And you have a consult, right?
Yeah, I do. Yeah.
Yeah, so we should probably just...
Yeah. No. Well, how's it going?
It's good.
Penny and I found a place near Preminger.
It's really nice.
An apartment?
Yeah.
Is it small?
It has two bedrooms,
and it's really close to some really great schools.
You picked schools?
No, I brought these so that we could decide,
so that we could talk about the possibilities.
You picked brochures. It sounds like you're decided.
She's going to school in New York?
I mean, if she does,
she would need to fill out an application,
which, actually, I meant to talk to -- - Okay. I'm sorry.
We need to take, a big step backwards.
Somewhere, sometime you heard me say yes to this.
You heard me say, "Yes, please, Callie,
take my daughter across the country."
But I never said that.
I did not. I said we could talk about it.
No. Callie, what you said was,
"You'll be able to see Sofia whenever you want."
Okay, that's not what I meant.
I'll "Be able" to see her.
I was just excited about making this move. That's all.
Go. Be happy.
Have your Penny.
You're ju-- You're not taking my daughter with you.
Please stop saying your daughter.
She's -- But she is my daughter,
and she's yours, and she lives here.
So I don't know why we're talking about schools over there
and bedrooms and...
I -- Why can't she come visit you?
'Cause that's not...
Okay. That's why we're here.
That -- That's what we're talking about.
That -- We are just discussing what the options are.
That's not what it sounds like.
How's Hot Rock Star?
Filthy as ever.
And creative.
I know, right?
I've got to keep coming up with new names for his...
Oh, no.
What's wrong?
Kyle is in town, and he wants to take me out to dinner.
I don't understand your face.
No. No, I'm not going.
Why not? Free food with bonus hot guy?
We're doing very well right now with our fingers,
so why screw with it?
You mean by actually screwing.
This is fun,
but we don't actually have anything in common.
You know, do surgeons even date musicians?
He is very chatty.
No, this is Grey. She wants labs back on her...
No. No.
What now?
No. I just sent something very filthy...
Isn't that the point?
...to Meredith Grey.
Undo, undo!
Undo! Undo! Undo! Undo!
No! There's no undo! There's no undo!
Thanks.
There you are.
I know.
And, Dr. Grey, I'm so sorry.
You should be. Did you get Sheila's labs?
Dr. Grey.
What?
Nothing.
Or thank you. You're a very classy lady.
Sheila, good morning.
This is Dr. Edwards.
Hi.
She will be assisting me in surgery this afternoon.
Sheila Davis. 5-centimeter hepatic adenoma.
scheduled for laparoscopic resection this afternoon.
She's off O.C.P.S for -- - Could you hand me my purse?
I think I have a hairbrush in there.
Sure. Trying to look good for surgery?
Not for surgery. For him.
James is coming today.
That's great.
James?
My boyfriend.
Sort of. I mean, "Soul mate" is gross,
but, yes, my boyfriend.
I'm finally meeting him today, and I look like this.
You haven't met your boyfriend?
Not in person.
They met online.
A year ago. And it's been the most amazing year.
Only over texts.
Then I told him about my surgery,
and he said he had to be here -- canceled everything.
That's really sweet.
I know it sounds crazy.
You can get a lot done in a text.
What am I doing?
I mean, why would I want him to meet me like that?
He's going to be expecting my profile pic,
and I don't really even look that good on my best day.
You look fine.
And Dr. Edwards completely understands.
She has a first date today, too. A big one.
Huge, apparently.
Really? That's so nice.
No. It's still up in the air.
We will be back to prep you for surgery. Okay?
Let's go, Edwards.
Apparently, you got my text.
Oh, yeah. I got it good.
Obviously it was not meant for you.
I hope not, because it sounds so painful.
It was very unprofessional,
and I should have been more careful.
Edwards, you really should save your energy,
because you're gonna need it.
Can we skip ahead to the part where this joke is old?
No. Did you really do this?
I have...not.
I've -- I've -- I was riffing on...
You -- okay.
I'm sorry. I'm confused. Your son is here?
Yes!
Yes!
We think so. Hers. Or mine.
They said there was a shooting. - Who said -- Who said that?
The police. When they called, we were -- We were --
We were at work, and -- and our sons are at -- at home with the sitter.
The last names are Green and Cole. Can you just look it up?
I'm here.
I'm sorry.
I don't see any record here for either of those names.
I got paged. Gunshot kid?
They said the ambulance was coming here.
Wait, "Gunshot kid."
That -- is that our kid?
Karev, let's move.
We have an incoming GSW. Victim's 8 years old.
Oh, my God!
Our sons are both 8 years old. Which one is it?
Which one of our sons has been shot?
Ma'am, we'll know more soon.
But right now --
Right now, we just need you to have a seat,
and we'll get back to you when we know something.
Oh, please, let them both be alive.
Come with me.
Come with me. Come with me.
Guys, I appreciate that you want to help,
but all I need right now
are Hunt, Wilson, and maybe cardio and neuro.
So, the rest of you can go.
Don't! No, we have to see who it is!
Ma'am, ma'am, please stay back.
8-year-old male, GSW to the abdomen.
Stable after 500 cc bolus NS.
Who is it? I can't see him.
We're -- We're gonna take care of him.
It's all right. We're gonna take care of him, okay?
No!
No, it's Brandon! It's Brandon!
Oh, thank God.
Peter! Peter, there you are.
Get him inside.
Coming through.
Brandon, Mommy's here! I love you!
Ma'am, we've got him. We've got him.
E.T. Tube in good position.
Breath sounds clear and equal bilaterally.
Well, does anyone know what happened?
Was it a drive-by?
Where the hell was the babysitter?
Hey, everybody, shush!
A GSW to the right upper quadrant.
Belly is soft.
Okay. I'm gonna need a...
An ultrasound.
You know -- you know, let me get in there.
I'll -- I'll -- I'll do it.
He's a little tachycardic, but his pulse is strong.
Shepherd, any reflexes?
Spinal shock. The bullet must have penetrated the spinal cord.
All right, let's get him to CT. Everyone clear the room.
All right, you heard him. Thank you and goodbye.
Okay, ready?
Okay.
Call us if you need us.
Ready and... On my count -- 1, 2, 3. Go.
Pierce.
We're good, thanks.
Sofia's doing really well.
You know, she loves her dance class,
and why would we take her out of school in the middle of the year?
No, no, no. No, no, no.
We wouldn't move her until after school's over for the year.
Well, yeah, no. "We" Wouldn't move her anywhere.
Uh, "We" Is you and Penny.
You can't do this. You don't get to just decide to --
I haven't decided anything. I'm trying to talk to you.
I'm trying to show you that I've thought out this choice.
But it's not just your choice.
To completely disrupt our child's life --
Why is it disrupting her life?
You moved three times a year when you were a kid.
You turned out pretty good. Why isn't it just life?
I have a consult.
Do you want to look at these?
No. No, I'm good.
He's so little.
He's so little.
Hey, you still have that, uh, prenatal appointment tomorrow?
Yeah, uh, at 9:00.
Will you, um...
Just, uh, let me know how it goes.
Absolutely. Uh, right after.
All right. Appreciate it.
Of course.
Brandon's injuries are severe.
And we're taking him up to surgery right now.
The bullet hit his spinal cord,
so at the moment we are evaluating --
Patty.
Stacy, are you okay?
Were you shot at?
I'm so sorry.
I left the room for just a few minutes.
Were the boys out front?
Did they find the person who did it?
No. The boys found your gun.
They were playing with it.
Your gun?
You have a gun?
Yes, I do. But it's locked.
No.
No.
We were just playing. It went off.
Did I kill him?
No. Peter, no, you didn't.
Peter, Brandon's alive, okay?
And we're gonna take care of him right now.
All right?
I'm gonna need to talk to you.
Let's go.
We don't know that.
Excuse me?
We told that kid that he didn't kill his friend.
He didn't.
Except we don't know that. Not yet.
You all right?
Yeah, I just -- I needed a second.
A little kid got shot.
Oh, God.
Yeah. It's just awful.
Okay.
Time's up. Yeah.
How did everything go with Arizona?
She's not even open to talking.
It's like she's just saying no.
I'm sorry. That sucks.
Did I jump the gun here?
I'm just trying to get all the ducks in a row
so that we can talk,
but it seems like she really just wants to fight about this.
Am I wrong?
Yeah, I-I can't help you.
There may come a time when I get to have a say in Sofia's life,
but that's definitely not now.
I'd just make things worse.
So, all I can say is I'm sorry.
That sucks.
Coags and LFTs are normal.
She's ready when the O.R.'s ready.
Great. How are you feeling?
Sheila, what's wrong?
Nothing. He just texted me.
He's here in the hospital, and he brought irises.
He remembered I loved irises.
It's just -- I was just freaking out.
Okay, well, let's try to calm down.
Sheila Davis?
Yes. Is he here?
Um...yeah.
Hi.
What?
Who are you?
I'm James.
Surprise.
No.
I-I-I know this isn't what you're expecting.
I'm -- I'm really, really sorry about that,
but I just -- - Oh, my God.
This isn't how I wanted to do this at all, but when you --
when you told me you were sick and you needed surgery,
I just couldn't wait.
You catfished her.
No, I-I just didn't want to --
Get out. Get out.
Sheila, it's -- it's James.
Get out! Get out!
We should call security.
James, let's go.
James.
Get out!
I think we should go outside. - Oh. Oh. I just --
L1 shattered and left fragments in the spinal canal.
So, his mom just had a gun laying around.
She said she had it locked up.
The mom should be locked up.
Well, she might be.
It could be involuntary manslaughter if --
Don't even say it. It's not gonna happen.
Do you own a gun?
No. No.
No, I, uh, fix bullet holes. I don't make them.
I just mean you're in the Army. I imagine --
Well, you need one in the Army. You don't need one here.
Well, every day,
someone's kid is in an O.R. with a gunshot wound.
Every single day.
When are people gonna learn?
It just makes things worse.
And people always say they need one for protection.
They don't.
Unless they do.
I have a gun.
Yeah, right.
I do. I've had one for a long time.
You have a gun.
Why?
Just like you said -- for protection.
Have you used it?
No. I haven't needed to, thank God.
Thank God you haven't had it used against you.
All right. Can we stop?
There's a kid down there scared to death
he might have killed his friend.
There are two lives on this table right now,
so can we just stop the chatter and pay attention?
Right angle.
What happened?
Sorry? -‭ Well, how did you --
Where were you that they were able to get a gun?
I was --
I left the room for a minute.
For a minute?
It was so fast.
So, but why? Why?
What?
Did you leave your phone charger in the car or...
were you texting or was it the TV?
No! The police already asked me all this.
Yeah, why were you gone long enough
for them to unlock a drawer or a closet or whatever
and pull out a gun and shoot it?
It was your job to keep them safe.
It was literally your job.
And I was doing my job.
The boys aren't babies. They're 8.
They go off and they play together.
I don't have to watch over them every single second.
They're good boys.
I-I should be able to go to the bathroom
or warm them up some mac and cheese
without them shooting each other.
Dr. Pierce.
‭I was just making them food!
This wasn't my fault!
Can I get you to take a look at something, please?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Did they call someone for you?
Is your mom coming?
Uh, Dr. Pierce.
I spent every day for an entire year talking to him,
and he's just...a liar.
Of course, I'm the idiot who let it happen.
I mean, I told him that I loved him before we even met.
Who the hell does that?
Well, you were ready for something good.
Yeah, plus, sometimes
someone can seem really, really good onscreen.
True.
Sometimes too good.
He was so good onscreen.
I know.
Oh, my God. Oh, Go-- No, no, no.
What -- - What is he doing here?
Wait. That's your date?
That's the guy you were gonna do the --
Please don't.
I mean, I wouldn't.
I'm classy, remember?
Hi. What are you --
Uh, I'm working.
I'll -- I'll -- I'll walk with you.
I'm, uh, Kyle Diaz.
Hi, Kyle. I feel like I know you.
What are you doing here?
You said you couldn't wait to see me.
I said a lot of things.
She did.
This is my life.
I get James and you get that.
You really need to leave. I'm working.
You know, Edwards, you can go and
catch up if you need to.
See? We get to catch up.
No, we really -- I don't need to catch up.
Uh, you really need to leave because I need to go operate.
Can I watch?
See you do your thing?
No.
No?
No, it's private, okay?
The O.R. is a private place, and you can't watch.
I'm working! This is an O.R. Elevator.
You can't go in here, either. The O.R. is a sterile area.
You are not sterile.
You are...very, very dirty.
Robbins.
I've been working on the resident rotation schedule.
Okay.
Yeah, and losing Warren and Blake --
I mean, soon enough, it's gonna have an impact.
Yeah.
would you care if you lost a resident for a few days
while I get things settled?
No.
I'll give you two interns.
No! No! Why is it just me?
Why are you taking my resident away?
Why am I the one that's just gonna roll over and take it?
And why don't you go screw someone else over?
Robbins, you might want to take it down a notch.
Callie's moving to New York.
What?
And she's trying to take Sofia with her.
Can she do that?
Hey. What are you doing here?
I'm doing it.
You're doing what?
Something other than literally --
literally watching the clothes dry at my house.
Slow down.
I'm meeting with Don Heller.
Seriously?
Yes. Yes. Look,
I have seven years in anesthesiology.
It's perfect. I can work,
help people, earn money,
and get time in the O.R.
Everybody wins.
All right. What does -- What does Bailey think about this?
Well, listen, it might not even pan out.
Right. I mean, why tell her
until it's a real thing?
That's what I thought.
Just keep it to ourselves.
Until we know.
You realize that's a terrible idea, right?
It's a great idea.
I wish you luck, sir.
It's a great idea.
I don't see any residual bleeding.
Can you get a good look?
Yeah.
Definite CSF leak.
We'll need to remove the entire vertebral body
to decompress the spinal cord, right?
Problem is, I'll need to dissect more of the aorta.
Risking paralysis? Is there another option?
Put him in a brace.
Then he wouldn't be completely decompressed.
So, we risk paralyzing him either way.
What are you gonna do?
Do I have time to talk to his mom?
Both the brace and the surgery carry some risk of paralysis.
My recommendation is the surgery.
It's very delicate, but I would like to try it.
My husband's on his way. Do I have to decide right now?
I'm afraid we can't wait.
Okay. Okay. Um, then please do whatever you can.
But he'll survive, either way, right?
Danielle.
We're working very hard.
He'll pull through. I know he will.
Danielle, will you shut up?!
What?
You better hope he pulls through.
This is not Peter's fault. He is a child.
But the gun was locked away.
They shouldn't have been in my room.
‭This is not the time --
Oh, don't you dare get righteous with me.
That was your house and your gun
and your kid that knew about it, not mine.
I sent my child over to your house to play,
and your kid might have made him a murderer.
I called the sitter. The kids are okay.
What's wrong? What happened?
Nothing. Nothing.
I just wanted to make sure they're okay, and they are.
What's wrong with you?
Oh. Okay, you guys haven't heard.
An 8-year-old came in today,
GSW, accidentally shot by his friend.
Anyway, just wanted to check in, you know?
Okay.
Man, I just... kids with guns.
Stop that.
We're not doing this. It's too sad.
Shake it off. We can be sad later.
We're talking juvie GSW during my surgery.
Richard, she offered me visitation rights
to see my own daughter.
Well, I-I'm sure she didn't mean it that way, Arizona.
How else would she mean it?
My lawyer says it's an indication that --
Your lawyer?
Yes, I have to protect myself.
I know you feel like you do.
But you and Torres
have always figured out this stuff beautifully.
Just slow down.
I just watched Jackson and April --
Yeah, I know. So did I. It was a mess.
A mess started
with overreactions and misunderstandings.
So, what? Now I'm overreacting?
I'm saying Sofia's too important not to
ask yourself if you are
before you do something that can't be undone.
You're right. Of course.
You're right. I know.
Retract more cephalad.
Great.
So, what's your deal?
I'll establish vascular control, and --
No, I meant about your date,
the one you blew off out there.
There is no deal. What's your deal?
Excuse me.
You're not supposed to tell me
to take my time to go see a guy.
You're supposed to tell me to hurry up and prep.
Can you please do your job and make my life miserable?
I'm just saying, after all those texts,
and then that's the way you treat him?
'Cause the texts are all it is.
Yeah, it's been a few weeks,
and it's good and hot, but...
I know. It's on my phone.
The expectations are too high.
There can only be disappointment from here.
You don't know that.
I know I am a very good "On paper" Person.
I mean, I shine. I'm amazing.
But when it comes to being an "In person" Person, I...
You said you wanted to work and not talk,
so can we focus on the work, please?
I said I didn't want to talk about sad stuff.
I'm okay to talk about this stuff.
Graspers.
Although, this is its own kind of sad.
Hell. I'm in actual Hell right now.
Well, you said to make you miserable.
Dr. Shepherd, BP is going down.
How's that bone graft coming?
It's out. Sealing up with bone wax.
It's in the house?
What?
The gun. Where is it in the house?
It's in a safe place.
I didn't even know it was there. I want to know where it is.
It's in a box under the bed.
It's under our bed?!
That's where we'd need it.
I don't want a gun in my house.
It's my house, too. It makes me feel safer.
Does it?
Have you seen our neighborhood?
Because you're not safer. You're more likely to get hurt
because of a freakin' gun around.
Alex.
I got shot once. You know that.
BP's 60 over 40. Starting him on levo.
Once I decompress the spinal cord,
it should get better.
I just -- Just let me work. - Work faster.
You okay?
Yeah. Just watching.
He's hypotensive now.
You'd make a good cop.
You nearly broke that babysitter.
‭I don't know what I was doing.
Why did I do that?
I watch my sister's kids all the time.
And last week, I turned away for one second,
and my nephew had dumped an entire bag of flour
on the kitchen floor.
He's 3.
And I thought,
"What if that had been a pot of boiling water?"
I'm not used to this --
being scared like this, worrying like this.
They're not even my kids.
Oh, I get it.
They're family.
Family messes you up.
That part's new for me.
Got a minute?
Ben. What are you --
I just came by to, uh --
You know, I-I had a nice conversation
with Don Heller just now.
You did?
Yeah. I thought I could
pick up some cases as an anesthesiologist,
and he said he'd be happy to have me --
No, absolutely not.
I said, "Great. When can I start?"
Ben, no.
I can't sit around that house for five more months, Miranda.
You're suspended.
Sitting around is the damn point.
I am suspended from the surgical residency program.
I won't be operating.
And I can stay current in the O.R.
I can earn a living.
Nobody's gonna go hungry.
Look, what's it gonna look like if the staff sees you
sitting in surgery like nothing happened?
It's gonna look like I'm working.
It'll make me look like I'm -- - You? You?
See, it's always about your job,
what's gonna make you look good or bad.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I don't know, but you're not doing this.
You run Surgery, not Anesthesia.
You're not chief there.
It's not your department. It's not your call.
Ben. You can do this.
Oh, I know I can.
But if you do,
you better figure out where you're gonna sleep.
How you doing?
Micro Penfield 4. Just a few more --
He's in V-tach, rate of 233.
Paddles!
No, no paddles.
His spine is completely unstable and exposed right now.
We have to.
If you shock him,
he will move and he will be paralyzed.
You'll undo all my work.
We'll try and take him down with meds.
Push Amiodarone, 125 milligrams.
Just give me a minute.
Add vaso on top of his pressors.
V-fib.
Shepherd, we have to shock him.
Charge to 50.
No! If he moves, he won't walk.
If he dies, he won't walk, either.
Clear.
Amelia, clear!
Just give me -- Damn it!
Clear.
Is Sheila okay?
James, Sheila was very clear. She wants you to leave.
I love her. I wasn't trying to lie.
Should I call security?
We talked online every day.
We understand each other in a way that --
I've never been seen like that or loved like that --
for who I am.
Well, not exactly who you are.
Yes. Who I am, not just what I look like.
So, when she asked to see my picture,
I-I looked at myself in the mirror and...
I got scared.
I knew this could happen. I'm not stupid.
But then, when she was dying, I had to risk it.
Well, she wasn't dying.
Her tumor, I mean.
It was a benign tumor.
The chances of it killing her were very, very low.
Excuse me?
Yeah.
You told me you were dying!
Get out.
You said you had a malignant tumor.
You said you were 6'2."
How could you lie straight to my face?
It wasn't even your face, you liar.
You said you were dying!
You said you had hair!
Yeah, I can't believe I'd fall for someone as superficial as you!
A person does not get to call me superficial...
Uh, are you calling security or am I?
I will, and I will handle Sheila's post-op.
You're done here.
Pardon me?
Edwards, go. Bite the bullet. Go on the date.
It's better than being lonely and crazy like me
or having sex with your phone in the residents' lounge.
Can you not --
Go. And don't text me from it.
You owe me a year of my life back!
God, I told you I loved you.
Stop yelling at me. So, you do love me.
No, no. I loved a stranger!
Security.
What is it, Torres?
No, uh -- We had a meeting scheduled for now,
but you're busy.
What's it about? - Um, it can wait.
Not gonna get any less busy, Torres.
Just tell me. - I'd rather --
I'd rather wait.
What is it?
I'm moving to New York with Penny Blake.
I'm leaving Grey-Sloan.
Uh, excuse us, please.
Mm-hmm. Sure.
When?
Well, Penny starts work in a couple of months,
so first I need to get some things squared away.
Like a job?
Uh, I already have an offer from NYU,
and Columbia's been calling,
so there's been a couple of other --
They offered you Chief of Ortho?
No. Um, it'll be fewer hours.
And Penny's working a lot, so...
And I'm hoping to have Sofia there.
What?
I mean, your career --
You're a chief. She's a resident.
So, you're giving up your career
to chase tail across the country?
I just wanted to give you notice.
And I don't need your judgment.
Arizona's already got that covered.
Hey. Start her on D5 half.
I'll be back in about a half an hour.
Uh-huh. Okay.
Hi. This is Dr. Robbins.
I'm sorry. From where?
Yes, I am.
Yeah, you bet I have a minute.
There's a chance of some recovery of movement,
but it's very small.
He'll get physical and occupational therapy
to help him regain some function,
find some new ways --
But he'll never walk again?
I'm sorry. It's very unlikely.
The gun was locked up.
It was supposed to be locked in a drawer. It was.
I don't know how they -- - Kids watch.
They pick up everything you do.
I'm very sorry that this happened.
Brandon didn't die?
No. He didn't.
But he can't walk?
And he can't ride bikes?
Is he mad at me?
If it had been Brandon who hurt you,
would you be mad at him?
A little. But it was just an accident.
Right.
So, I want you to promise me something.
Whenever you feel bad about this,
I want you to say,
"It was an accident.
I didn't mean to."
I know that.
But you have to know it, too.
So, you got to promise me you will say,
"I didn't mean to."
We can go now, right? We're free to go?
Will you promise me that?
Peter, honey, it's time to go.
Thank you.
Well, Brandon's doing fine. His BP's...
I lived in my car when I was 16 years old.
Every night, trying to fall asleep,
I would listen to the voices --
people going by,
people who had nothing going on,
nothing going for them, nothing to lose,
scared to death that they would break in and take my stuff,
take me.
This gun made me feel like
I had something,
something on them.
But then, today...
That little boy will never walk again.
Jo, he's still alive.
Barely.
You know, back then, I...
I didn't value my life all that much,
but
it's different now.
I've outgrown this.
I don't need it anymore.
I don't want it.
I thought we were getting drinks.
Your exact words were "Somewhere special."
Come on.
This is, uh -- This is the holy ground.
Also the dirty ground with the dirty rugs and --
Have they ever cleaned any of these?
No, they'll never change anything in here --
the paint or the rugs.
They don't -- They don't really want to mess with the --
with the acoustics, you know, or the, uh -- or the mojo.
Every major musician from Seattle has recorded here.
And now me.
All I wanted was just to record here,
right here, this -- this very room.
You know, this is --
This is where I-I feel the most like myself.
This is the me that I like the most.
Yeah, I get that. I get that.
The O.R.'s kind of that way for me.
You know, the feel of the scrub brush,
the smell of the antiseptic -- It's just --
The air changes when you walk in.
It gets cold.
You can feel your mind sharpen as you step up to the table.
Yeah, it's like -- like you turn it up a notch.
Or a bunch of notches.
Like you get charged.
Yeah, right.
Okay.
I like it.
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
Come on.
What is this? What is this? "Come on?"
Aren't you gonna play something for me?
Oh, you want me to play for you?
Isn't that your move?
Don't you play for all the girls?
Hey, it's my life.
You know, when I'm playing,
it's how I let someone in, let someone see, uh --
Okay, it's my move, right?
Yeah.
It's my move.
But, uh, it always works, though.
Yeah, I bet.
You want me to play for you?
Kyle, you don't need moves.
Okay. I'm ready. Let's go.
I just want to go see the kids.
I did something very good today.
I pushed two hearts together.
I forwarded the course of love.
‭What's wrong? What's wrong?
I-I don't know how you do it, Mer.
Do what?
Love your kids like this.
I really love them.
They love you, too.
No, I love them like --
If something happened to them, I would die.
Like, my heart is so wide open, and they're so fragile.
I don't know how you live like this.
I don't.
It's awful.
Sometimes, you just have to push through it,
push the awful aside, just get through the day.
I think you saved that boy today.
I paralyzed that boy today.
I was too slow.
No, I meant Peter.
Nathan...
Nathan cheated on my sister.
I know.
I, uh -- I...
And when she found out, she called.
She told me.
And I said --
I said...
"Just forget about him.
Walk away.
Just get on a chopper and come to me."
I told my sister to get on that helicopter.
I did it.
That was the last thing I ever said to her.
You didn't mean to.
Got a late one, huh?
I do. Everything okay?
I wondered if you wanted to go in the morning to the OB.
O-Of course I do. Yeah.
Good.
Baby should know that you're there.
I will be there.
9:00 a.m.?
Sure.
Hey, there he is. Glad to see you, man.
Glad it all worked out.
Yep. Yep, it worked out.
Once we fire that first shot, we're committed.
God, she was so little.
You remember when Sofia was in here
and you could see her heartbeat in her whole body?
God, how impossibly tiny she was.
I can't believe our girl was ever that little.
There's almost no way to take it back.
I jumped the gun. I'm so sorry.
I was carried away when I first told you.
And I've done everything wrong since.
Sofia is our little girl,
and I am not trying to make plans without you.
Please believe that.
The Barton School called me.
They wanted to talk to me about her application,
which they loved.
They called you?
So, tell me that part again
about how you're not making plans?
You know how these things work. There are waiting lists.
It doesn't mean that I actually tried to make --
We're not talking about this anymore.
Hey, you don't get to decide that. I'm going.
I don't want to leave Sofia behind,
so we have to work out something.
Yeah, I just mean that you're not talking to me about it anymore.
The question becomes --
Do we keep firing back...
You got a lawyer?
Yeah. You can talk to her.
You hired a lawyer.
Yes.
Now who's jumping the gun?
You started this.
All right.
...and declare an all-out war?
