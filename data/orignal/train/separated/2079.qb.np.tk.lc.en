are they still back there ?
still there .
how did they find us ?
they pay off people to spy for them .
kids , shopkeepers , even the police .
so it could &apos;ve been anyone .
we &apos;re not safe anywhere .
quick , pull in here .
kill the lights .
okay , so what &apos;s the plan ?
i &apos;m gonna draw them off you , off the car .
tsim sha tsui clock tower , you know where that is ?
i can find it .
we &apos;ll meet there in an hour .
adam , wait .
you promise ?
yeah .
yeah , i promise .
i love you , kono .
i love you , too .
adam , run .
what are you doing ?
get out of there .
and i &apos;ve lost visual again .
well , luckily , audio &apos;s alive and well .
i don &apos;t know , billy .
i don &apos;t think sandra cutler &apos;s gonna need
this much evidence of her husband &apos;s infidelity .
you know , a simple still photo of those two kissing
would probably be enough to convince her .
she paid us to get the truth ,
that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re doing .
what she does with it is her business .
how long have we been sitting here , anyway ?
three very long ... hours .
my butt is totally numb .
well , what about me ? i drank four bottles of coconut water .
well , i warned you .
dehydration is your friend on a stakeout .
you know , you can use one of the empties in the back
if you really can &apos;t hold it .
it &apos;s nothing i haven &apos;t seen before , so ...
i am a trained seal , rollins .
i think i can hold it .
besides , it looks like they &apos;re finishing up .
good , &apos; cause i want to go home and take a shower .
maybe bleach my brain to rid myself of the image
of naked john cutler and his girlfriend .
hey , you &apos;re not gonna quit on me , are you ?
what ? where did that come from ?
it &apos;s just , when i offered you this job ,
i promised you an exciting post @-@ navy life .
world travel ,
intelligence gathering .
last week , we protected a foreign national .
yeah , and this week , you &apos;re a peeping tom .
i &apos;m gonna think of it
as practicing my surveillance skills .
that &apos;s a wrap , folks .
we &apos;ll just hang out here a few more minutes for him to leave .
and then we &apos;ll head out .
before i drop you off ,
you want to hit the wailana for some pancakes ?
sounds good .
it &apos; him .
what is that about ?
billy , he &apos;s got a gun .
what did you forget ?
drop your weapon !
catherine !
i &apos;m all right .
billy !
it &apos;s okay .
let me see . hang in there .
stay with me .
stay with me .
you &apos;re not gonna die today !
do you hear me ? you hear me ?
billy , stay with me .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
you wanted more excitement , right ?
this isn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind .
got a gsw to the stomach .
he &apos;s o @-@ neg .
you &apos;re injured , too .
i &apos;m fine , i &apos;m fine .
get him into trauma one .
get two large bore ivs in him and hang saline .
he &apos;s lost a lot of blood .
initiate massive transfusion protocol
and let &apos;s get him intubated .
get her into the er now . get her to trauma two .
late @-@ night tune @-@ up ?
yeah , i &apos;m just , uh , switching out the plugs .
you know , i hear you can pay somebody to do that for you .
are you crazy ?
you think i &apos;m gonna let some know @-@ nothing
grease monkey get his hands on a classic like this ?
your dad felt the same way about this car .
and that was before it was a classic ,
when it was just old .
don &apos;t overtighten .
i got this .
thanks for coming by .
sounded like it might be important .
kind of hoping you could tell me .
well , how long have you been trying to reach her ?
a couple weeks .
no luck .
well , your mother is a difficult person to pin down .
i really need to speak with her .
i was kind of hoping maybe you could get in touch .
what makes you think she &apos;ll answer my call ?
because you &apos;re not asking any difficult questions .
steve , if doris knows you &apos;re looking for information
about her relationship with wo fat ...
she &apos;s gonna avoid me as long as she can .
but if she &apos;s off the grid ,
it could also be for reasons
that have nothing to do with you .
i mean ...
you know something you &apos;re not telling me here , joe ?
no , i &apos;m just reminding you
your mother &apos;s a complicated woman .
but i will reach out .
i will see what i can find .
okay .
mcgarrett .
yes .
where are they ?
where am i ?
you &apos;re in the hospital .
just @-@ just take it easy , okay ?
do you remember what happened , catherine ?
you and billy were on a stakeout .
yeah , we were .
we , um ...
we got what we needed ,
and , uh , we started breaking down the equipment .
and then ... and then i saw ...
oh , god , billy .
is he all right ?
steve ?
he &apos;s gone .
he , um ...
he coded on the table , and they couldn &apos;t revive him .
i &apos;m so sorry , catherine .
but ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
boss said you wanted to see me .
this man &apos;s name is william harrington .
former lieutenant commander seal team 7 .
he saw action in iraq and afghanistan .
he served his country with courage and distinction .
i &apos;ll take good care of him , sir .
i &apos;m sure you will .
i just wanted you to know who he is .
what are you doing ? you can &apos;t pull that out .
now listen to me .
i checked john cutler &apos;s pulse
before i got billy into the car .
he was already dead .
my phone was in the back of the van ,
and i was so hell @-@ bent on getting billy here
that i forgot to call hpd about the cabin .
we need to get back there now
because it &apos;s a crime scene .
listen to me . listen to me . stop .
you need to stay here
and you need to rest , you understand , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna call duke . i &apos;ll call hpd
and get a csu team to the cabin .
okay , good , but i &apos;m going , too .
no , catherine , you &apos;re not going . you &apos;ve been shot .
steve , billy &apos;s killer is out there , okay ?
and i can &apos;t be in here .
and you of all people should understand that .
okay .
duke , what &apos;s going on here ?
why isn &apos;t your team inside processing ?
better if you see for yourself .
steve , there was blood here .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
look , you &apos;ve been through a lot , okay ?
is there any chance you got the address wrong ?
i was unconscious for hours .
somebody came in here during that time
and scrubbed this place .
catherine .
look , john cutler &apos;s body was right here .
you smell that ?
okay , that &apos;s bleach .
it &apos;s a kitchen floor , catherine .
huh . they painted over the blood spatter .
they mopped the floors , everything .
all the evidence that john cutler was ever here ,
they took away .
look , i know i &apos;m right .
duke , get the csu team in here ,
process this house , all right ?
then process the surrounding woods .
two people were murdered ,
there &apos;s got to be evidence of that .
you got it .
we &apos;ll find it .
when did sandra cutler hire you and billy
to tail her husband ?
four days ago .
she thought he was having an affair ,
and she was right .
that &apos;s motive .
and what if she already knew he was cheating ,
she &apos;s gets a hired gun ,
you and billy are her alibi ?
i put an apb out on cutler &apos;s car .
i also pinged his cell phone
in case it was still on the body .
no signal .
whoever cleaned the cabin ,
got rid of the car and destroyed the phone .
yeah , that fits with what csu is telling me .
the place is spotless .
no prints , casings or shells inside or out .
there were traces of blood in the living room ,
but they were too contaminated to test .
so we &apos;ve got nothing ?
we do have this .
set of tire tracks consistent with a commercial van .
okay , if they &apos;re the only tracks at the scene of the crime ,
then the van belonged to our cleaner .
yeah , the shooter drove a sedan .
after he left , he must &apos;ve called in the cleanup .
all right , well , let &apos;s see if we can locate the van .
what about the cabin ?
do we know who owns the cabin ?
maybe there &apos;s a connection there to cutler .
yeah , a couple from iowa keep it as a vacation rental ,
and cutler rented it out for the night
through a kahiku management company .
he had been using it a lot
over the past few months ,
probably to meet up with this woman .
i was able to isolate a screen shot of her .
who is she ?
her name is abby maxwell .
she advertises herself online as a &quot; companion . &quot;
she charges a grand an hour .
cash only .
i went through cutler &apos;s finances with a fine @-@ tooth comb .
the girl , the cabin--
he didn &apos;t have that kind of cash available .
so where &apos;s he getting his money ?
mrs. cutler ,
can you think of any reason
why anybody would want to kill your husband ?
did he have any problems at work ?
anybody there he didn &apos;t get along with ?
john repaired and upgraded the office computers .
whenever the system crashed ,
john could always get it back online .
people were happy to see him .
sandra , when you first hired billy and me ,
you said it was because john had been acting strangely .
what was the first thing you noticed that was different ?
he put an encryption code on his laptop ,
locking me out .
you assumed it was another woman .
is there any chance it could have been something else ?
i honestly have no idea .
we &apos;d like to take the laptop if we can .
maybe we can crack the code .
and if we can , maybe we &apos;ll find some answers in there .
may i help you ?
i &apos;m here to see abby maxwell .
i &apos;m afraid she &apos;s with a client .
lieutenant chin ho kelly , five @-@ o.
tell her i &apos;m here to talk about last night &apos;s client .
this is crazy .
if i had stayed at that cabin another ten minutes ...
did his wife do it ?
he always said she &apos;d kill him if she found out .
right now , everyone in john cutler &apos;s life
is a person of interest .
look , i just launched this firm , man ,
and i &apos;m not exactly pulling in the big commissions yet .
so i go on a couple dates a month ...
just to pay my rent .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m a criminal or anything .
actually , abby , according to the law ,
that &apos;s exactly what you are .
well , for what it &apos;s worth ,
after this , i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m getting out .
of course i &apos;ll cooperate ,
but if we could just keep this between us ?
how often did you and cutler meet ?
for a while , maybe once a month .
that &apos;s strange .
we went through his phone logs ,
both home and cell-- your number isn &apos;t there .
he said he got a special phone just for me .
see for yourself .
hey , monkey , listen , i got to go ,
but i want you to break a leg , all right ?
ooh , wait a minute .
you don &apos;t say that in cheerleading , do you ?
well , &apos; cause you could actually break a leg , you know ,
if one of those weak kids at the bottom
drops you when you &apos;re doing a cutie @-@ pie double ,
or whatever it is .
a cupie double . yes , i knew that .
listen , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m gonna just say knock &apos; em dead .
how about that ? i love you very much .
have fun , okay ? call me right after .
okay , bye .
i &apos;m so sorry . come here .
thanks , danny .
hey , you didn &apos;t have to rush back here .
won &apos;t gracie be disappointed that you &apos;re not there
to cheer her on ?
uh , yeah , but , uh , the last year at the nationals ,
the judges said that i was too loud ,
i was distracting them , so i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be fine .
anything you need , just tell me , okay ?
okay .
thank you .
you all right ?
yeah , i mean ...
i did a tour with this guy , you know ?
i want who did this .
i know you do .
so just tell me what to do .
we got john cutler &apos;s laptop ,
but it &apos;s encrypted .
i guess i could run it by toast , see what he can do .
i got to tell ya , i think even toast has trouble with this one .
we &apos;re gonna bring in the big guns .
big guns ? like who ? what do you mean ?
big guns like me .
i &apos;ll take it to one of my old d.o.d. contacts ,
see if he can &apos;t crack it .
appreciate it , joe .
you want to go for a ride ?
sure .
all right , but i &apos;m driving .
oh , yeah , yeah , that &apos;s the story of my life .
chin , what do you got ?
so it turns out our victim had a second phone
he was using to contact abby maxwell .
it &apos;s probably a burner
that his wife didn &apos;t know about .
okay , well , if he had a second phone ,
maybe the cleaner missed it .
i &apos;m sending you the number .
got a hit .
tracing it now .
it &apos;s moving .
all right , make a right up here .
he &apos;s just up ahead .
how close ?
about a hundred yards .
he &apos;s right in front of us .
there ! that &apos;s cutler &apos;s car .
hands on the dash !
right now !
don &apos;t move , buddy .
get out of the car real slow .
put your hands behind your head ,
interlock your fingers .
turn around . face the car .
spread your legs .
i didn &apos;t steal it , brah , i swear !
the keys were in the ignition !
what are you talking about ?
i was just bouncing around kalihi .
saw the windows down , saw the keys ,
i figured some guy just wanted to dump it .
put your hands behind your back .
now .
i got him .
steve , i don &apos;t see the phone ,
and he doesn &apos;t have it on him .
i &apos;ll check the trunk .
sit down .
is he in there ?
when &apos;s the last time you changed your shocks , joe ?
about a year ago . huh .
you do the struts , too ?
&apos;cause i got to say , feels like maybe
your suspension might be off just a little bit .
no , she &apos;s handling good .
you didn &apos;t feel that ? when we went over that dip ,
it felt like i was gonna throw up ...
no , no , i did not feel that .
okay .
some people like a looser ride than others .
it &apos;s not my place to judge .
you like it , it &apos;s your car , it &apos;s fine .
that , you didn &apos;t feel though ? that wasn &apos;t ... ?
is this what you and steve do ?
you bicker in the car like an old married couple ?
bicker ? no , no , we don &apos;t bicker .
i mean , we argue from time to time , sure ,
but we don &apos;t-- no bickering .
well , look , how about if i change the subject ?
that @-@ that would be fine .
steve asked me to get in touch with doris .
okay , well , i @-@ i mean , that makes sense .
you know , he &apos;s got questions , and she may have the answers .
yeah , well , what i didn &apos;t tell him was
i &apos;ve been trying to find her for over a month .
i haven &apos;t talked to her since she put
adam and kono on that freighter that night .
and the chatter is that once she left the country ,
old enemies came out of the woodwork .
what , she &apos;s on the run ?
or worse .
or worse ?
well , what are you gonna tell steve ?
i can &apos;t tell him anything .
i don &apos;t have any confirmation .
what i &apos;m hoping is that
you will tell him to stand down on this
and let this go .
because we start turning over rocks ,
god knows what might crawl out .
yeah , so i &apos;ll just talk to steve .
what makes you think he &apos;s gonna listen to me ?
because he trusts you .
he looks at me , he sees ulterior motives .
he looks at you , he just sees a friend .
ah , okay . well , i could tell steve
whatever you want me to tell him and he &apos;s gonna say ,
&quot; okay , sounds good , &quot;
and he &apos;s gonna go off and do whatever he wants to do .
and you know that .
so my advice to you is ,
please , get confirmation on these rumors ,
and get the truth , and share that truth with steve .
because you know and i know
that he &apos;s not gonna stop until he gets it .
are you sure it was sato &apos;s men ?
i don &apos;t know .
it could &apos;ve been the triads .
here &apos;s what you need to do .
you need to get yourself out of hong kong .
you got to get to one of doris &apos;s safe houses , okay ?
no .
kono ...
look , not without adam .
you &apos;re still a target .
they &apos;re not gonna take you off
their hit list just because they already have adam .
i &apos;m not leaving him , chin .
kono , listen to me !
what good are you gonna be to adam if you &apos;re dead ?
look , just get yourself out of hong kong , okay ?
let us worry about getting adam back .
he gave himself up for me .
he sacrificed himself so i could get away .
we will find him .
i promise .
now , please , will you do what i &apos;m asking ?
cousin , i love you , but i have to do this .
okay , listen . hpd canvassed the area
where our little car thief found the impala .
unfortunately , there &apos;s no traffic cameras down there ,
so we &apos;re never gonna know who dropped it off .
what about you ? you get anything ?
yeah . the cell that led us to cutler ?
yeah .
found something interesting on it .
what ?
all right , so according to abby ,
cutler used this phone exclusively to contact her .
right .
but ...
look at this .
the last number cutler dialed was to a different number .
right . and check out the time .
10 : 51 .
that &apos;s two minutes after the shooting started ,
which means that not only did cutler not die instantly ...
he was alive long enough to place a phone call .
let me see that .
exactly .
we &apos;re sorry ...
disconnected ?
yeah . probably a burner .
okay , so this guy ,
he takes two at close range , he &apos;s bleeding out .
he doesn &apos;t call 911 , he calls some mystery number .
we need to find out who was on the other end .
chin . on the way .
cutler had a ton of classified material
on his hard drive , all related to
palek &apos;s various military projects .
wait . cutler didn &apos;t have security clearance ;
how &apos;d he get the intel ?
from his wife .
he installed a pretty sophisticated piece of malware
on sandra cutler &apos;s laptop ,
and so he was able to have access to all of her
work files , e @-@ mails , everything .
so not only was this guy violating the marriage ,
but he was violating her privacy
and stealing her security clearance .
now here &apos;s where it get really interesting .
it turns out , cutler was routinely
downloading classified data onto flash drives .
sounds like he was spying for somebody .
that &apos;s what we were thinking .
if you &apos;re right , that would explain
where he &apos;s getting all that extra cash .
it would also explain why he got murdered .
the type of people that would pay cutler to spy for them
probably wouldn &apos;t think twice about killing him
if their relationship went south , right ?
okay , so if cutler is selling classified info ,
who &apos;s the buyer ?
i reached out to my friends
over at fbi counterintelligence ,
and they say the most likely suspects
are this trio of private companies .
himmel aerospace and defense .
that &apos;s palek &apos;s chief rival .
check out one of the names of their subsidiaries .
kahiku management company ?
they rent out the cabin where cutler was killed .
well , that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
up until now , we thought that that was a place
that cutler used just to bring abby maxwell ,
but what if it was also a dead drop
for those flash drives ?
all right , chin , uh , who runs himmel &apos;s operations
on the island ?
that would be a lee benner .
let &apos;s go say hello .
so you &apos;re accusing us of corporate espionage and murder .
that &apos;s absurd .
john cutler was gunned down
in a secluded cabin managed by your company .
you gonna tell me that was a coincidence ?
yes .
if that &apos;s what actually happened .
what do you mean , &quot; if it happened &quot; ?
i was there . i saw it happen .
well , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i haven &apos;t heard anything about a murder
at one of our properties , so ...
you must be mistaken .
there &apos;s been no mistake .
you guys killed cutler and then you covered it up .
show me some proof .
well ... ask and you shall receive .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s a lab report .
see , we just matched up the tire tracks
found at the scene to a van registered to your company .
how &apos;s that for proof ?
so why don &apos;t you tell me what happened with cutler .
did he up his price and it piss you off ?
maybe you thought he &apos;d been compromised . what happened ?
what happened ? !
yes , cutler was spying for us .
yes , we scrubbed the crime scene .
but we didn &apos;t kill him , come on .
oh , of cour ... i &apos;m sorry , right .
so somebody else killed him
and you covered it up ?
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s the truth .
is it ?
we didn &apos;t want anyone connecting cutler back to us .
so , yes , we covered it up .
look , cutler was feeding us good intel .
there was ... there was no reason to kill him .
in fact , we tried to save him .
what ? what are you talking about ?
he called us for help right after he &apos;d been shot .
and @-@ and i can prove that , too .
we had a burner phone that we kept in touch with him ...
we know about the phone . what happened next ?
we sent a medic .
but by the time he got there ,
cutler had been dead for a while .
after that , we were just ,
you know , worried about controlling the situation .
damage control .
well , maybe you ought to start worrying
about your legal defense , because right now
you &apos;re looking at obstruction of justice
and accessory after the fact .
okay . yeah , you got me dead to rights .
but ...
maybe ...
we could help each other out .
how do you figure ?
well , what if i were to say that , um ...
in the course of cleaning the crime scene ,
my people ...
may have gathered evidence .
evidence that could help you catch
whoever killed cutler .
what a mess .
with all the cross- contamination , we &apos;ll be lucky
to pull a single print off of any of this stuff .
do what you can , okay ? it &apos;s all we &apos;ve got to go on .
yeah .
when he was five years old ,
i asked my son steve
what he wanted to be when he grew up .
&quot; i want to be a cop , dad , like you . &quot;
i told him to ...
be anything but that .
let &apos;s change this out , huh ?
oh ... i &apos;m sorry .
you all right ?
this could &apos;ve done with some more stitches .
what are you laughing at ?
i was just thinking back to the last time i needed stitches .
all right .
billy and i were
on an operation in kabul ...
yeah .
... and , uh ,
i got this nasty cut on the back of my head .
it was gonna take , like ,
15 , 20 stitches to close it up ,
but all we had were band @-@ aids .
yeah .
what &apos;d you do ?
billy just grabbed
these huge clumps of hair around the cut
and tied them together .
like a ... like a shoelace .
that &apos;s pretty resourceful .
i know .
all right , you &apos;re good .
i just can &apos;t believe he &apos;s gone .
yeah .
and for what ?
for trying to save a guy like john cutler ?
now , listen to me , all right ?
billy saw somebody in danger ,
and he reacted , all right ?
that &apos;s what he did .
and the fact that he knew the kind of man that cutler was
and he still put himself in harm &apos;s way ?
he was a hero , catherine .
yeah .
i just got off the phone with the lab .
there &apos;s something you &apos;re both gonna want to see .
what do you got ?
well , there were no prints
on any of the shell casings from our shooter &apos;s gun .
but the lab did find traces of blood
on one of the slugs from billy &apos;s gun .
wait a minute . billy hit the shooter ?
apparently .
that &apos;s my boy .
it must &apos;ve been a through @-@ and @-@ through .
i bet the slug was imbedded in the cabin wall
and our cleaner dug it out .
you run the blood ?
yeah , we got a match , too .
our killer &apos;s a guy by the name of
jason kroll .
he &apos;s believed to be a hit man .
hpd had him as a suspect
in two homicide cases last year ,
but couldn &apos;t make anything stick .
we got any idea who hired this guy to kill cutler ?
no , but courtesy of his parole officer ,
we have a current address .
so why don &apos;t we go ask him .
jason kroll ! five @-@ o !
i got blood .
move .
jason kroll ?
five @-@ o ! open the door !
jason ? we know you &apos;re hurt .
we can get you help .
but first we need to know that you &apos;re not armed .
he &apos;s armed .
you think ?
we need the paramedics right now .
right now , catherine , go !
catherine , now ! paramedics , let &apos;s go !
okay .
who hired you to kill john cutler ?
don &apos;t you die on me , you son of a bitch .
you hear me ?
hey ! who hired you ? !
you got anything ?
nothing .
keep looking .
there &apos;s got to be something here
that &apos;s gonna tell us who hired this guy .
guys ?
i think i got something .
what ?
okay , so it looks like
kroll was hired over the tor network .
what is that ?
it &apos;s kind of like a shadow internet .
some people call it &quot; the dark @-@ net . &quot;
it was originally created by the navy ,
but nowadays it &apos;s utilized mostly by criminals
because it allows them to be completely anonymous .
so tracing an i.p. ?
is not gonna happen , but ...
here comes the good news .
according to these e @-@ mails ,
kroll wouldn &apos;t take the cutler job
unless the client revealed himself .
and did they ?
not at first .
but they came around .
here-- looks like they sent their last message
outside of the network .
and that i.p. we can trace .
but i liked john .
why would i kill him ?
well , maybe you liked him more than you let on .
you wanted john to take you away
from your secret little escort life ,
but he had no intentions of ending his marriage .
a woman scorned , abby .
it &apos;s the oldest motive there is .
these e @-@ mails ?
they were sent to the shooter .
we traced the i.p. address .
comes straight from this office .
o @-@ only i couldn &apos;t have sent these .
see the date and the time ?
i wasn &apos;t here ;
i was with a client at a hotel on kalakaua .
i can prove it .
okay , abby , who else has got access to your computer ?
just my assistant andrew .
he &apos;s taking off .
you should &apos;ve let me die .
andrew , why would you do this ?
i &apos;m in love with you , abby .
i &apos;ve always loved you .
i just wanted you to stop .
unrequited love .
second oldest motive there is .
hello , sam .
geez , joe .
when &apos;d you get back ?
you know me , i come and go as i please .
family is safe and sound , fast asleep .
well , can i assume you didn &apos;t break into my home
just to say hello ?
when john mcgarrett was investigating his wife &apos;s murder ,
he found a lot of evidence , bits and pieces .
not all of it made sense to him at the time .
you recognize those numbers ?
can &apos;t say that i do .
it &apos;s an offshore account .
cia used it to fund black ops .
if i gave those numbers to a reporter friend of mine
and he started digging ,
who knows what he might come up with .
or how high it goes .
what do you want ?
doris mcgarrett .
i need a location and a phone number .
take my advice , joe ,
and just walk away .
this one &apos;s too hot .
steve mcgarrett wants answers , sam .
he &apos;s not gonna quit till he gets them .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
because we &apos;re friends ...
i &apos;ll give you the information you want on doris .
you can decide how much of it you want to share
with her persistent son .
it may be the better part of valor
to keep him in the dark ...
once you hear what i have to say .
eternal rest grant unto billy , oh , lord .
and let perpetual light shine upon him .
may his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed ,
through the mercy of god , rest in peace .
amen .
ready .
aim .
fire .
ready .
aim .
fire .
ready .
aim . fire .
i just wanted to say i &apos;m so sorry , mr. harrington .
thank you . tom .

he talked about you a lot , you know .
he said you guys were a lot more than just father and son .
that you were real friends .
he was a good boy .

thank you .
steve ?
i know that , uh ...
this is not exactly the time or the place ,
but i have news about your mom .
you gonna give me the whole story this time ?
i &apos;m pretty sure you didn &apos;t give it to me the other night , joe .
you &apos;re right , but that &apos;s only because at the time
i didn &apos;t want to burden you with what was only a gut feeling ,
with fortunately turned out to be wrong .
you thought she was dead ?
i did .
but i have confirmation
that is not the case .
so where is she ? when &apos;s she coming home ?
i don &apos;t know .
and she &apos;s not .
at least not anytime soon .
the word is that doris is active again .
that &apos;s all i got .
everything else is classified .
it &apos;s classified . wow .
i want you to please keep looking for her .
you shake the trees and you find her , okay ?
steve , your mom stayed hidden for 20 years .
she is not gonna be found .
she &apos;ll surface when she &apos;s ready .

i think that &apos;ll be when she &apos;s prepared to face you .
