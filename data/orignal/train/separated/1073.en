Peter, you have the right to remain silent.
Curtis Hagen. What's your offer?
I know how to make Peter Burke a free man.
Coins, minted from Welsh gold.
I can make a believable facsimile of James's voice.
I shot and killed senator Terrance Pratt
using Peter Burke's gun.
With this evidence in hand, I see no other option
than to drop all charges.
Mr. Burke, you are free to go.
I think the gold was used to bribe
the federal prosecutor on Peter's case.
You figured out what I want yet?
The Mosconi Codex.
You're gonna steal it for me.
If this book is a puzzle,
maybe these are the pieces.
I know that the Codex leads to the window.
Isn't it lucky you were already planning to steal it for me?
But there's something you should know about me.
I'm not an FBI agent.
I'm a criminal informant.
Morning.
Morning.
Again.
There you are.
Oh, don't worry, they delete the audio every 24 hours.
Audio?
I thought you said it was only a tracking--
Oh, you are gonna pay for that.
Oh, yeah?
You pick up some moves in that Moroccan jail?
Maybe.
I would love to go back, but the world's too big
to go back to the same place twice,
don't you think?
The world used to be my oyster.
Now, I know every oyster bar in my two-mile radius.
Two miles.
That means you can never come to my place.
Look...
My life is complicated.
Is that too much for you?
No.
I didn't like you because you were a FBI agent.
No?
No.
I liked you because you were smart
and marginally easy on the eyes.
And then, there was the Codex.
Speaking of, can I ask you something?
You wanna know why
I'm investigating Chapter 13.
Well, if it's not for the bureau...
When you're a criminal,
you get to know other criminals.
My friend was in a lot of trouble,
and the only person who could help him
was a really bad guy,
and the payment was Chapter 13.
So I stole it.
And you made a copy.
To find out why he wanted it.
That was the right answer because that means
that this can still be undone.
I mean, do you think the original pages are safe?
Yeah, I'm sure.
So it's possible that they could be returned?
I mean, after we figure out why Mosconi wrote
the Chapter 13 in the first place
and what the stained glass window
has to do with all of it...
Rebecca, um... I just--
I think it's best if we distance you
from all of this.
Oh. Why?
The guy I gave that chapter to
is not someone you wanna know.
Trust me.
Right.
Of course, of course. I-I trust you.
My temp job calls.
Oh. You knock now.
Oh, I had enough of an inkling
about what might have transpired last evening
to require a drink tray.
Oh, you showed her your anklet.
And then you showed her your anklet again.
That's not a euphemism. You're wearing a robe.
I told Rebecca everything.
Abridged-- nothing about you,
and very little about Hagen.
What about stealing the--Macchiato?
Thanks, Agent Gruetzner.
Never caught your first name.
Mozzie, short for "Mozart."
No further questions. That's all you'll ever know.
I can't believe I thought you worked for the FBI.
Apology accepted.
You look nice, by the way.
Merci.
I have a lunch.
I better go.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
You two have fun doing...
Things.
Morning.
Morning, Jones.
I just came back from a pawn shop.
Finally decided to unload
your action figure collection?
Never. We got a call from the owner.
The watch list?
I knew this day would come.
I never thought this particular day would come.
What, that we'd be outside a bastion of the Masons,
planning to heist a very old, highly fragile
200-pound stained glass window?
Well, give or take, depending on the lead content.
Crafted by Mosconi in 1887.
Yeah, right before he died.
Or was killed.
It's a big job for two people.
Are you implying that we may need help?
No, I'm just saying we have backup,
if we need her.
As devoted as rare books Becca is
to our cause, we don't have time
for third wheels or--
Training wheels. I know.
Once we figure out what Hagen wants with it,
we can loop her back in.
Is it possible he's making us dance
just for his amusement?
He's not easily amused.
Let's focus more on the "How"
before we get bogged down on the "Why."
Step one.
Modified six-finger.
Very precise.
The CO2 cartridge gives you the juice.
Well, you can't replace a pane in a window that old
without removing the whole thing.
The church will call a glass repair service.
I'll keep an eye on the place.
When they set up the scaffolding
to reach the window...
We'll make our move.
Good.
Look what turned up today.
Peter...
This is a Welsh gold coin.
Yup.
I think it's one of the ones stolen
through that travel agency.
Yeah, I'd put money on it.
Where'd it come from?
A pawn shop.
Someone came in to sell it.
Did the owner give you a name?
Patience.
Something tells me that's not a name.
It always pays off
because the criminal always messes up.
It always comes around to bite them.
Must be our lucky day.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
I put those coins on an FBI watch list.
This was my first case after prison,
my last case as a field agent.
Oh, I remember.
And now we have a lead.
I'm not gonna stop until I catch the thief
who stole that gold.
Well, the suspect dressed up as FDNY,
broke through the wall to access the vault
and steal the coins.
This is our shot to recover
a 1.8 million in rare gold.
And we're operating under the assumption
that this is part of a larger batch that went missing.
I think our thief was testing the waters.
What do you think, Neal?
I'd float one coin. Wait to see what happens.
It could be.
Did the pawn shop owner get an I.D.?
They did.
Sister Minnie O'Malley.
She swiped it from the collection basket.
You look surprised.
So does she.
How many Hail Marys will that get her?
Oh, the sister's not the only one
with sticky fingers.
This coin has been stolen more
than second base at a cubs game.
We followed the coin's trail,
questioned the parishioners who were at St. Magnus's last sunday.
Susan Barrett made the donation
after she found it in her son's sock drawer.
Turns out her son Abe
stole it from a cash-for-gold shop.
Set off the alarm, but the owner of the shop
didn't want to file a report when NYPD got there.
Probably gets his product primarily from fences.
Exactly.
These three are known for trafficking precious metals.
Find the fence, lean on them
to reveal who brought in the coin.
Now, while all appear to have dealings with the owner,
we may be looking for someone outside our radar.
Anyone you want to add to that list, Caffrey?
I'll hit the streets. See what I can find.
Good. That's it.
Neal, hold up.
I want to go with you.
Look, if it is someone new, it's because they're good.
They hear the FBI's sniffin' around,
they'll go underground.
Fair enough.
Make it fast.
All right.
Neal?
Uh, while you're you're pounding your pavement,
I'm assuming Mozzie has connections
with these type of fences.
I'll talk to him, but he has a lunch.
A lunch?
If I interrupt it for FBI business,
squealing on a fence will be right below
joining facebook on his to-do list.
See ya.
Hey, hon.
I know you have lunch plans.
Yeah, but I need to swing by your office.
Hey! Can you break a hundred?
Sorry, pal.
Fives, tens, whatever you got.
I'll even take Welsh gold.
I'm due in court--
$1.8 million.
Less one coin, that is still a lot of money.
The FBI's trackin' that coin.
When they find your fence, and they will,
he's gonna point to you.
Look, I know you took a bribe
to drop the indictment of Peter Burke.
You're harassing a U.S. attorney.
I want your name, so I can charge you with slander.
Oh, yeah, sure. It's Neal Caffrey.
I'm Agent Burke's criminal informant.
I'm also an associate of Curtis Hagen,
and I stole the coins you were paid with.
Tell me who you brought that coin to.
I can run interference.
Why implicate yourself?
Mutually-assured destruction's a powerful motivator.
I need a name.
I...
Come on, you worked at Treasury.
You didn't think Welsh gold
would be hard to unload?
I was presented with a dollar figure.
So it was Hagen's idea to pay you in coins.
And who to go to, to unload the--
He said it would be safe.
If you don't give me a name, nobody is safe.
你在哪儿
我到了 你在哪儿
鞋子不错 回头看
El told me about your bat phone
since day one.
I should have known she'd choose you.
I have questions.
Hey, it's Neal.
Listen, I need Estelle.
No, right now.
I am under no obligation to provide answers.
In fact, as a citizen of this great country,
you actually work for me.
Well, let's get the IRS on the phone,
see how much you've chipped in for my salary.
I may have time to entertain a query or two.
Who do you know that fences high-end metals?
Platinum, gold, copper?
I am neither informant nor rat.
Diana's doing well.
So is little Theo.
I'd hate to break up that maternal bliss
and ask her about the Teddy Winters case.
That would be unfortunate.
You have a name?
Dekker. In the flower district.
He traffics metals?
Sure.
Let's go with that.
His front is the one with the tulip sign.
That's fresh.
Karl Dekker.
Runs a stall at the flower market.
Flowers imported daily from all over the world.
Trucks in and out.
Yeah. If you're gonna deal in illegal goods,
it's a smart front.
Adjusting exchange rates
means messy books.
Good way to hide money.
Never been busted for fencing
but was arrested for an arms trade a few years back.
Yeah, he served the minimum
after flipping on the buyer and the seller.
Good, that means if we apply the right pressure,
he'll tell us who brought him the coin.
Well, it looks like Caffrey came through.
Mm, no. This was my intel.
Well, maybe he'll walk in with the exact same lead.
Or maybe he won't.
Imagine my surprise when Fair Estelle
descended with your message.
Well, you're not answering your phones.
Shh, the panic in your voice
is causing her feathers to ruffle.
Her brain is the size of a raisin.
Au revoir, ma belle!
All right.
Dawson moved one of the coins we stole for Hagen,
and it turned up on Peter's desk.
Do you know a fence named Karl Dekker?
Moz, come on. Peter is on our heels.
No, we're on his.
He crashed my lunch. I put him on Dekker's trail.
All right, then we need to get to him.
If Peter gets to Dekker first
and Dekker points to Dawson--
Dawson might admit to taking a bribe,
but they can't connect it back to you.
Yes, they can.
That's how I got Dekker's name.
And if he somehow crumples
under the suits' verbal waterboarding--
Peter's indicted, and I'll end up in prison.
I had a falling out with Dekker.
He got the flower district.
If he sees me, he'll chase after me
with his pruning sheers.
Okay, then I'll go in alone.
Which shop is it?
The New Amsterdam Garden Center,
the one with the tulips.
And that's what you told Peter?
Well, even under duress, I didn't tell him everything.
It's the red one.
What are you doin' here?
What I told you.
Running down a fence.
Karl Dekker.
That's our guy.
This is our location.
New Amsterdam Garden Center.
The sign with the tulip.
Let's go.
Peter, uh...
I really think it's best if I approach Dekker alone.
Nope.
No, if there's a lead on who fenced that coin,
I want it firsthand.
All right.
I'm gonna kill him.
What?
There are three signs with a tulip.
Yellow, red, pink.
Did your source tell you which color?
Of course he didn't. Did yours?
I say we start with red.
Red it is.
Hold on.
What, you're reconsidering the red tulip?
So what if I am?
Let's go check out the yellow ones.
No.
Okay, that leaves pink.
I know what that leaves us with.
A dozen long-stems, thorns clipped off.
This stays airtight.
I make sure of that.
Hello?
What the hell?
Who the hell--
Get the hell out, now.
The FBI is storming the gates.
Feds. This a set-up?
I don't know. Is it?
Look, why don't we split up?
I'll take yellow. You can take pink.
I-I'll take pink. You take yellow.
Red.
We're back to red.
Yes.
Okay.
Gentlemen, we must move.
Time usually marches. But in this case, she sprints.
I'm gonna crush your larynx with a 12-gauge wire.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that,
And you are not leaving here with a dozen long-stems.
I'll give you a choice.
Bleach and a body bag, or that backdoor.
Hey, look, viceroy tulips.
You should buy some for Elizabeth.
Maybe on the way out.
Every time you show up, you cost me money.
Dekker, just put it down.
Follow me.
We interrupted a deal.
AK-47. Serial's burned off.
Ammo disguised as seeds.
Wait a minute. I know those shoes.
Those are Mozzie's shoes.
How much did switching shoes with that guy cost you?
Oh, a Benjamin Franklin and exposure to athlete's foot.
At least they're comfortable.
Yeah, well, Peter's not happy.
Oh, and now I have carte blanche
to the flower district.
The universe has achieved equilibrium.
The scaffolding is up?
Yeah, Sanderson glass reports
to the church at 7: 00 a.M.
My recon tells me
they get their caffeine fix at 9:00.
Yeah, well, once we're up in the scaffolding,
we're exposed.
Front and side exits are weak spots.
We won't have long.
Well, we'll figure it out.
Look, ever since I left this morning,
I've been thinking about the window
and the Codex and us--
Come on in.
Hey, Mozzie.
Good evening.
That--the sketch.
It wasn't here earlier.
Did you just draw that?
Of course it was.
You guys have a plan for the window.
We were working on it.
I-I'm gonna go, uh, soak my feet
in tea tree oil.
You do that.
You were thinking?
I--
I was.
I still am.
I said I understood why you need to go ahead
on the Codex without me, but I actually don't.
Believe me when I say
it's for your own good.
That book brought us together.
Things are getting exciting.
I want to be part of it.
I want to be part of this part of your life.
Mozzie and I are stealing the stained glass.
It's a crime.
You're not a criminal,
and I don't want to turn you into one.
The only reason I know that
is because I found the schematic.
I was gonna share the window with you once I had it.
Neal, what was the point of all that honesty last night
if you're just gonna keep secrets from me?
I wanted you to know who I am.
And now, I want to protect you from who I am.
I don't need protecting.
But I do want to know one thing.
What?
Now that you have what you want,
the Chapter 13, some Mosconi insight,
me...
Never mind.
I know the answer.
You got everything you wanted.
Come on.
It's not like that.
It feels like that.
Look, um, it's gonna be dangerous in the dark
for you and for the windows, so just be careful.
It won't be dark.
We're stealing it tomorrow morning.
Really?
While the repairmen take their coffee break.
But--
The Scream was stolen during the day, twice.
Mona Lisa too.
How long will that take?
We haven't timed it out yet.
But how do you know you'll be able
to pull it off before the workers get back?
Why do I feel like these are leading questions?
What if you let me help?
I told you I don't want you--
Nothing illegal.
I could be a lookout or a distraction,
just so that you and Mozzie have the window you need.
To steal the window.
Admit it.
It would help.
It would, actually.
So?
You're in.
Yeah.
I came so close to getting Dekker yesterday.
We seized a flower shop full of guns...
But not the man behind it all.
Mm. I'm sorry, honey.
It's probably payback for using your wife's
not-so-secret phone to track Mozzie.
Mozzie, I get.
It's Neal and those Welsh gold coins.
You really think he stole them?
It would explain why they didn't want me to get to Dekker.
I don't know, stealing the money
just to take it, and then selling it to a weapons-dealing fence
just doesn't seem like Neal.
Well, a lot doesn't add up on this one.
$2 million missing from the Summers investigation,
and that FBI pen that I found at the chiropractor's office,
the one where Neal was.
It's Dekker.
He's the last straw.
Hey. Asac Burke.
You know, the last time you became suspicious,
it ended up being about a woman.
It's never just about a woman.
A lovely woman,
the first one in a really long time
that Neal's been interested in.
He's back.
Where?
16th and Rutherford.
Now you know where he is.
Yeah.
All right. The window's out.
All we have to do is get in there,
lower it down--
And roll away with it,
avoiding the cameras on that stop light,
that church, and that garage.
The city's becoming a modern-day panopticon.
Easy, Bentham. That's a rant for another day.
There go the repairmen on their coffee break.
Rebecca, are you sure about this?
Yeah.
These are my favorites.
Gotta sell it, right?
See you on the other side.
See you.
You go, girl.
What?
I've always wanted to say that.
No. No, no, no.
Excuse me.
Could you help me?
I--my earring fell down the drain.
It was my grandmother's.
It's--it's all that I have left of hers.
Yeah, but--forget it.
No, you know what? It's fine.
Go, go. I-I'm sure that I can lift this.
Listen.
Step aside, baby girl.
I got this.
Really?
In the crate.
Clamp it shut.
Bungee cord.
And we lower her down slowly.
You guys done in there yet?
Whoa. Someone's headed our way.
Right uniforms, wrong faces.
I'll occupy him.
How?
I'll ask him a question that he'll be compelled to answer.
I'm in need of a sanctuary.
Look, try the Hare Krishna's over in Boerum Hill.
They'll give you lunch. Now, excuse me.
I need to check on a window repair.
Oh, how rude of me.
Blaine Rockford.
On the level.
On the square.
That handshake.
You're of the 33rd order.
Who will help the widow's son?
Oh, come with me, Brother.
You are safe.
So, Mr. Rockford, you are welcome
to wait here as long as you need.
Oh, no, thanks. I'm quite recovered.
Dehydration led to an acute bout of paranoia.
Is it possible for me to procure some more of this holy swill?
Well, it's not--
The widow's son is parched.
Got it.
Ohh. Here you go.
I guess I picked the right guys for the job.
The least I can do is buy you guys some coffee.
Nah, we gotta get back.
Oh, really?
Hey, did you get that smile from your grandma too?
Everybody says so.
I bet.
Here we go.
Hey, let's get going.
All right.
Okay. Go.
You got it?
Dare I say we pulled it off?
As long as you walk under a ladder
and step on a crack at the same time.
I think maybe we pulled it off.
What's goin' on?
It's gone.
What is?
The window. It's gone.
Who'd steal a window from a church?
I got a pretty good idea.
When you were on a break, you didn't see anybody?
No.
Peter?
I work with him.
He works for me. Thanks, guys.
What's goin' on?
Somebody stole that window.
That's weird.
Very.
The church called the FBI about a stolen window?
No, they did not.
I was in the area.
You pulled my tracking.
Puts you here on a regular basis.
You caught me.
What's that?
Well, if a croissant and a donut
give each other a very special hug...
You come here for food?
Oh, it's more like a controlled substance.
Yeah, the shop's right around the corner.
Here, take it.
I'll go stand in line for another.
No, hold on.
Yeah, Jones.
That is interesting. I'm on my way.
What's interesting?
Something jones found.
Well, I'll come with you. I like interesting.
Nah, go buy yourself another croissant-donut thingy.
The same corner we followed him to?
Yeah. When I got there, someone had stolen
a stained glass window from a church.
Stained glass window.
I got nothin'. What did Caffrey say?
He blamed it on the pastry,
which I add to my Venn diagram of loose ends
along with the Welsh gold.
Well, this place is another kind of gold mine.
It looks like Dekker was a middleman
for a major arms deal.
Poppies equal pistols. Ranunculus equal revolvers.
Freesias equal .45s.
And he left something else behind.
Unmarked bills.
And Krugerrands and antique silver.
Hard to track, like Welsh coins.
Leave everything here and clear out.
Dekker ran away without his emergency stash.
Good chance he'll come back for it.
I'll gear up for some quality time in the van.
If he does, we'll get him.
Call me at 7:30 with an update.
What if there's nothing to report?
Call me anyway.
7:30 sharp.
Saved you half.
Coming!
Hey, Peter.
Do you want to come in?
I want answers.
You looking for something?
Yeah. About $2 million in gold coins.
You won't find 'em here.
You're not that sloppy.
You really think I took them.
There was a moment when you were alone
upstairs in that firehouse.
And why else wouldn't you want me
to go with you to talk to Dekker?
I told you he would spook,
and look what happened.
Yeah, Jones. What do you have?
7:30, like you said.
No sign of Dekker.
Great. Bring him in.
I want him to sweat.
No, Peter.
I said, "no sign of Dekker."
I want him ready to sing when I get there.
You got it.
Dekker.
You got him?
What'd I tell you?
Criminals always mess up.
Come on.
Time to find out who has those gold coins.
Neal?
Let's go.
We can't.
Because you stole them.
It's not what you think.
Neal, you impersonated a fireman,
and you robbed a vault under my watch.
I can explain, all right?
Don't! Don't you dare try to justify what you did!
I put myself out on the line for you, all the time!
I helped your father.
I was charged for murder because of it.
Will you please--
I nearly lost everything--
I did it for you!
What are you talkin' about?
To make sure Dawson would authenticate the confession.
My prosecutor?
He took a bribe.
You couldn't find James, could you?
I tried.
So you forged his voice,
and I was cleared on false evidence.
Look, even if you were found innocent,
indictment would have ended your career at the FBI
because of me.
Because of my father.
I couldn't let that happen to you.
Neal, do you realize what you have done?
Yeah.
I made sure justice was served.
No.
That's what I do.
Put out your hands.
I have to arrest you.
I'll do the time,
but you think about it, Peter,
what this will do to your life,
to Elizabeth.
I did the right thing.
None of this is right.
Okay, so you just, uh, left Neal at his apartment?
He's not goin' anywhere.
If I book him, this all goes on record.
I just needed to talk to you first because--
Because what?
Because there's no way out of this.
Well, there has to be.
Honey, Neal committed a crime.
Dawson accepted a bribe, and I know about it.
I don't even deserve the badge to arrest them.
I've been promoted.
I'm being groomed for D.C. None of this is real.
Whoa, whoa, wait. All of this is real.
I mean, all of this is deserved.
Honey, you-- you turned them in.
Your case is gonna be reopened.
I'll be indicted,
there will be a murder trial, and I'll lose my job.
No, that's not justice.
You're--you're innocent.
Why should we lose everything?
Ah, this is all my fault.
I asked Neal to do whatever he could to help you.
Honey, Neal broke the law. You didn't.
I'm glad he did.
I can't condone this.
I believe in the system. Always have.
What does it say about me if I let this go?
It says that you're a man
who stays and fixes what's broken.
It says you're a man who understands
the letter of the law is subjective.
I'm sorry.
I swore I'd never put you through this again.
Are you willing to give up everything we've built?
I need to be able to live with myself.
Then do what you have to do,
but just be damn sure that you need to do it.
You were right.
Dekker came back for the money.
He was not at all happy to see me.
Well, I'm sure.
Peter, I didn't ask him about the Welsh gold yet.
Why not?
Well, 'cause he should get serious time
for the weapons charge.
I mean, Dekker's cut deals before.
He'll try to plead down the guns--
Yeah, we can keep the coins as leverage.
All right.
You want me to go in there with you?
No. You made the bust.
You take it.
All right.
You didn't have Dekker last night.
No, but I knew we'd get him.
Misinformation.
It's an acceptable method of extracting a confession.
Sometimes the ends do justify the means.
I'm gonna tell Dawson that I know he took a bribe.
If you--
I know what it means.
You want me to go with you?
No.
Mr. Dawson.
Agent Burke.
What brings you here?
I'm investigating a federal prosecutor.
He took a $1.8 million bribe from my criminal informant.
You can spare me the look of surprise.
I don't like what you're insinuating.
Then you're really not gonna like this.
I have Karl Dekker in custody,
The fence you used to liquidate the Welsh gold.
I hope you can substantiate this.
I can. My c.I. talked.
I know everything.
Mutually-assured destruction.
Turn in the coins to the FBI anonymously and resign.
And if I don't?
Turn in the coins and resign,
or I arrest you right now.
I hope you can live with that ultimatum.
Either way.
You think Peter will cuff Dawson?
Well, he hasn't yet, or I'd be in a cell.
Peter can't ever know that Hagen was behind that bribe.
Or that we're the reason the Dutchman made his appeal.
Or that there's evidence of me stealing the coins.
We are running out of time.
I have to hand over this window to Hagen by--
That's kind of a crime unto itself.
Did we really need to take it apart?
Well, if we really want to find out
why this is so important,
we have to open up our minds.
Actually, we still have some good--
No more hallucinogens, Dr. Leary.
Free association, then.
Um, purple. Go.
Okay. Color.
Color in stained glass comes from metallic salts,
copper oxide, cobalt, gold.
Metal.
Another word for stained glass is "Lead light."
Maybe the iron framework is a map.
The concept of stained glass
was never to see the world outside.
Or to admit light.
It was to control it,
to use it to reveal something.
But what?
A question only a masonic-italian expatriate
mad genius trained in painting, metallurgy,
and engineering can answer.
Hold on a second.
Look at this.
That's Mosconi's signature.
How did it get there?
This blue pane.
A decoder lens.
Let me see.
No, it only works on this one.
Mosconi made this window and hid his name in it,
along with the decoder.
It doesn't work on ours.
Because it's a copy.
That's why he needed--
Neal, you asked me to trust you.
You can trust me.
The man of questionable character
I told you about?
His name is Curtis Hagen,
and he's holding incriminating evidence over me.
A Damocles' sword, if you will.
And now we know he needs this to decode Chapter 13.
We had to give him the original.
But without that glass, he'll never know the secret.
We can turn the tables.
so what's the plan?
Leverage the decoder for the evidence tape.
Then you'll be free.
Or not. Depends on peter.
Yeah, Caffrey?
You heard from Peter?
Not since yesterday. Why?
He's late. He's never late.
Well, there must be a reason.
Must be.
I got a tip on the Welsh gold.
It checked out.
Jones, put a team together.
My office, now.
Every time.
I'm glad it's you, not me.
Thanks.
The coins are in a safety deposit box
at a bank downtown.
Andrew Dawson no longer works
for the department of justice.
What about you?
I'm still here.
Look, you arrested a dangerous fence,
recovered the gold, took down a dirty prosecutor.
It's a win.
It's a compromise,
One I will never make again.
I know why you did what you did.
Yeah.
To help my friend.
And because you're a criminal,
and you can't help yourself.
Shame on me for expecting anything else.
Things are gonna change
for the both of us.
Yeah.
It's time they did.
