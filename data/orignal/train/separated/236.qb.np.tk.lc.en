gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i love you , dan humphrey .
serena ...
i really hope we can talk later .
charlie ! i &apos;m sorry . i thought you were charlotte rhodes .
i am , yeah . people call me &quot; lola . &quot;
and you are ?
looking for a different charlotte rhodes .
if they ever found out the truth
about the real charlotte rhodes ,
they would never forgive me .
i &apos;m , uh ...
nate archibald . yeah .
i worked your office christmas party , remember ?
&quot; a true american princess &quot; ? &quot; the next diana &quot; ?
if this is supposed to be her happiest day ,
then i can &apos;t wait to rain all over her parade .
why do you need this ?
what &apos;s the point of doing something scandalous
if you don &apos;t record it ?
of course i love you , chuck .
i &apos;ve always loved you .
i love you more and more every day ,
if it &apos;s even possible to love someone that much .
from this moment forward , there is nothing between us
but a contract .
our marriage is all for show ,
and you &apos;re going to put on the best damn show anyone ever has .
this was the only car with the keys in it .
it &apos;s fine . just go .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. gossip girl .
everyone wants their wedding to be perfect .
but on the upper east side ,
perfect isn &apos;t good enough .
although some disasters
can &apos;t be avoided .
excuse me . have you seen the bride ?
no .
sorry .
rufus , mom , hey , do you guys know where blair is ?
no , i &apos;ve not seen her
since the newlyweds &apos; last dance .
and where have you been , young lady ?
your mother and i have been showing off our moves
on the dance floor , and you and dan should join us .
oh , that sounds great , except i have to find blair .
all right , suit yourself .
eleanor , do you know where blair is ?
i haven &apos;t been able to track her down .
oh , i &apos;m sure she and louis are off having a private moment
to let it all soak in before making their grand exit .
okay .
serena ?
blair seems happy , doesn &apos;t she , with louis ?
of course . i mean , she--she loves louis ,
and she &apos;s a princess now .
so you know , as soon as that soaks in ,
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be beyond happy .
i hope so .
that &apos;s all i want-- is for her to be happy .
i hope she knows that .
i &apos;m sure she does .
enjoy .
thank you for coming .
i &apos;ll tell blair you said good @-@ bye .
oh , i was worried you left for your honeymoon already .
oh . please tell me you know where blair is .
i , uh , i believe she went to the powder room to freshen up .
okay , i @-@ i won &apos;t keep her long .
i know you guys have to leave soon .
okay .
but no matter how you might plan for perfection ,
there &apos;s always a hitch .
blair confessing her love for chuck
at her own wedding
is the best thing
to happen to &quot; gossip girl &quot; in years .
so this is the big scandal you wanted ?
not quite . blair still married the twerp .
but she left the reception early . something &apos;s wrong .
i just have to figure out what it is .
right now ?
aren &apos;t you exhausted ?
on the contrary .
i &apos;ve never felt more invigorated .
i can &apos;t find blair anywhere .
i checked every stall in the building .
did you check her room upstairs ?
three times . i even had security look at the roof .
why would she be on the roof ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe i &apos;ve seen &quot; the hangover &quot; too many times .
it just-- it doesn &apos;t make sense .
why isn &apos;t she dancing with her dads
or saying &quot; good night &quot; s with louis ?
i can &apos;t believe she had me keep her phone for her .
security at the empire . hello ?
what ?
oh , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll be right there .
it appears our question &apos;s been answered .
blair &apos;s at my place .
you must be pretty desperate to flirt with me
by doing manual labor .
what ? this isn &apos;t flirting .
i &apos;ve always wanted to load a catering van .
one more thing to cross off my bucket list , right ?
nate , what are you doing down here ?
oh , i &apos;m just lending a hand .
these things are heavier than you think .
pretty desperate , nathaniel ,
although it looks worth it .
just so you know , blair left without telling anyone
and fled to the empire .
we &apos;re heading over there now to find out what happened .
arthur should be here by now .
i told him to pull the car around back
so nobody would see us leave .
oh , you could be waiting a while .
the bride and groom are supposed to be leaving
since there are photographers everywhere .
traffic is a mess out front .
luckily , this lets out onto a side street ,
so i can take the van out that way and avoid the mess .
look like we might need your van .
or maybe we can ask nicely for her to give us a ride ?
please , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s for the bride .
she &apos;s run away from her own wedding
without telling anyone ,
and we just need to find her and make sure she &apos;s okay .
i know that you don &apos;t know us--
wait . the princess is a runaway bride ?
and you guys are going to look for her ?
yeah , i &apos;m so in . i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll drive .
great . thank you so much .
what ? i &apos;m worried about blair , too .
thank you for coming .
merci .
merci beaucoup .
bonsoir .
mother .
keep smiling . pretend that everything is fine .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
people wish to bid farewell to the happy couple ,
and i &apos;m hearing that your bride is nowhere to be found .
maybe you should tell me what is going on .
i was so angry . i couldn &apos;t wait .
what did you tell her ?
everything we discussed
that after humiliating me ,
she will be my wife in name only .
what were you thinking ?
the press is outside awaiting your departure ,
and there are hundreds of guests here .
this is why i told you to wait .
blair needs to be by your side this instant .
i fear she may have left .
the reception is winding down .
i will tell the press
that the happy couple have slipped out back .
in the meantime , i &apos;ll find out if eleanor
knows where her daughter is .
prince louis may not have been left at the altar ,
but the honeymoon appears to be over before it begins .
blair ?
hey , guys . beautiful wedding , huh ?
what have you done with blair ?
nothing , except tell the dumbest member
of your security team that i was her .
sorry . i had to get your attention somehow .
this is georgina sparks .
she &apos;s pretty much the worst person you &apos;ll ever meet ,
so just avoid eye contact at all times .
georgina , what are you up to ?
why do you always assume my motives are nefarious ?
well ... look , i felt bad for filming the video ,
and i &apos;m trying to make it right .
so when i saw blair hightail it out of the reception
without her frog prince ,
i knew i had to help .
cross my heart and hope to die .
here &apos;s hoping .
you saw blair leave ? where was she going ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if you want to find her ,
i was the last person to lay eyes on her ,
so you &apos;re going to need my help .
looks like everyone wants to know
where the royal bride ran to ,
but will they find her in time ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand . the dominican republic ?
louis may not agree to a divorce here in the states ,
but ... i think i can get one there without his consent .
well , was researching divorce law
part of your wedding prep ?
because that should have been your first sign .
elizabeth taylor got her fourth divorce there .
there &apos;s some weird loophole in the law
where you don &apos;t need the groom .
or maybe they just take bribes .
either way , i &apos;ll figure it out when i get there .
is this all because of chuck ?
i mean , i @-@ i can &apos;t believe
he sent that video in to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
no .
i mean , i don &apos;t know . maybe .
it &apos;s just the second that video came out ,
louis transformed into a totally different person .
so the sooner i can free myself of him ,
the sooner i can get on with my life .
so ... you wanna go to the dominican republic right now ?
do you know a better way out of this ?
the white zone is for loading ...
you sure about this ?
all right , then let &apos;s get you on the next flight
to santo domingo .
you can run , and you can hide ,
but , princess b . , beware .
gossip girl has eyes everywhere .
we may have an open seat
on a connecting flight through orlando .
let me just get my supervisor .
thank you .
what is the holdup , humphrey ?
people are starting to stare .
all the direct flights are booked ,
but she &apos;s working on it ,
unless you &apos;d prefer three connections .
whatever gets me out of here the fastest .
if someone were to recognize me and louis figured out
where i was going , he would try to stop me .
somehow i think that dragging you out of here
kicking and screaming is exactly the kind of embarrassment
you &apos;re trying to avoid , right ?
no , i mean that he would try to stop me from getting a divorce .
the grimaldis have a great deal of international influence .
one call to a diplomat in the dominican republic ,
and i can kiss my one shot at freedom good @-@ bye .
oh , my god . that &apos;s blair waldorf .
great .
it is going to be bieber fever in here in about one minute .
i mean , everyone is staring .
relax . they &apos;re staring at you
because you &apos;re wearing a wedding dress .
yeah . right . you-- you have a point .
hey , hey !
yes , you . you seem to have reasonably good taste .
what do you think about trading me
this gorgeous , one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind vera wang
for the least offensive thing in your suitcase ?
tell me you know who vera wang is , or keep walking .
wait a minute . are you her ?
are you the princess of monaco ?
oh , my god . are you on your honeymoon ?
oh , my god ! oh , my god . the prince must be here .
where is he ?
no , uh , i &apos;m not her .
it &apos;s true . they just bear an uncanny resemblance
to one another in every way .
yeah . we--we are decoys ,
a @-@ a distraction so that the real royal couple doesn &apos;t get mobbed
by tabloid @-@ obsessed losers like yourself .
no offense .
now that i get a better look ,
you &apos;re not nearly as pretty as blair waldorf .
and he &apos;s terrible .
you think i &apos;d be insulted by someone with a samsonite ?
look , i just need to change ,
so lend me your credit card
so i can go shopping while you get my ticket .
they do give credit to people from brooklyn , right ?
oh , hey , serena , what &apos;s up ?
hey , sorry i disappeared from the reception .
i spilled red wine all over my dress ,
if you can believe it .
and i went home to change , and with traffic ,
it &apos;s just taking longer than i expected .
yeah , no worries .
i mean , i @-@ i didn &apos;t even realize you &apos;d left .
oh . um ... well , do you know where blair is ?
i need to talk to her , but i have her phone ,
and i &apos;m sure she &apos;s around there somewhere , right ?
blair ? um ... you know what ? you just missed her .
she--she left-- she left with louis .
oh . they left together ?
yeah . i mean , isn &apos;t that what they do at weddings ?
anyway , they &apos;re gone . you know , they &apos;re gone .
they &apos;re , uh , probably on their honeymoon now .
you really should come back , &apos; cause it &apos;s--
it &apos;s kinda ... done here .
you sound weird .
no , i don &apos;t .
uh , is this--is this about what i said to you earlier ?
no , no , no , not at all . it &apos;s--
i mean , i &apos;m just--i &apos;m tired from all the dancing .
i should have given it a rest
after &quot; funky cold medina . &quot;
look , i know that i said you don &apos;t have to say anything ,
but ... don &apos;t you have anything to say ?
i do . i do , but i just--
i ... gotta go to the bathroom .
i mean , i &apos;m walking in the men &apos;s room right now .
can i just--i &apos;m gonna call you later , all right ?
dan says blair left with louis .
maybe we &apos;re overreacting .
you &apos;re not . dan &apos;s lying .
he &apos;s gotten pretty good at it , too .
seriously ?
you think you stand out less in that ?
anything &quot; i heart new york &quot; is the perfect camouflage .
a true new yorker wouldn &apos;t be caught dead in it .
she wouldn &apos;t give me your ticket without you here ,
but i got you a seat on the next flight .
it &apos;s like 36e or something like that .
coach ?
yeah , which is also the perfect camouflage .
it cost me a fortune since it &apos;s so last minute .
you &apos;re welcome .
okay , then i just need your passport
so we can issue the ticket .
oh , my god . her passport .
once again , humphrey , i am one step ahead of you .
now ... i know it &apos;s unorthodox ,
but this is an emergency , and i don &apos;t have my passport .
so i &apos;m hoping that you will allow me
to prove identity with this .
一位真正的美国王妃
don &apos;t believe her !
she &apos;s a decoy . she told me so herself .
and check out how bad the prince is .
okay , once was enough .
look , i am blair waldorf . see ?
okay , this is probably not the best way to go unnoticed .
great . now i need a passport to prove i &apos;m me ?
if that stupid video had never come out ,
none of this would have happened !
i &apos;ll get dorota to bring it to me .
give me your phone .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m believing georgina over dan ,
and dan said that blair left with louis .
why do you automatically assume that i &apos;m the one lying ?
if your opinion actually mattered to me ,
i &apos;d be insulted .
why are you still here ?
don &apos;t you have a hole to crawl back into ?
i want to help . let &apos;s think of the possibilities .
ideas ? anyone ?
who are you calling ?
security .
you overstayed your welcome when you showed up .
hey , it &apos;s me . can you send someone up to the penthouse ?
多洛塔刚到达霍道夫家
yeah , i have a situation .
no need for security . the jig is up .
ah , you caught me . i have been lying .
um , i don &apos;t know what to say .
i &apos;m bored , and my dvr is empty .
listen , i can normally keep this up for hours ,
but i have a kid now , and his mommy and me group
is way more fun to mess with than you guys . bye .
wow , seriously ? what is her problem ?
hey , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry blair wasn &apos;t here .
i know you were hoping she would run to you .
i should &apos;ve known it wasn &apos;t her .
i need to make peace with the fact that it &apos;s over .
whoever released that video
killed whatever chance i had with her .
your phone &apos;s ringing .
no , no , it &apos;s blair &apos;s .
it &apos;s a text from louis .
that &apos;s weird if they &apos;re together .
&quot; where the hell are you ? get back here this instant . &quot;
thank you so much for continuing the night with me .
i have so much adrenaline ,
i can &apos;t possibly sleep .
it &apos;s too bad that the men in our lives are such bores .
hey , i &apos;m still here .
and i &apos;m fairly certain that lily and i weren &apos;t boring when
we closed out the dance floor to &quot; moves like jagger &quot;
oh , let me tell you , even jagger couldn &apos;t move like jagger
in these heels .
i hope you don &apos;t mind if i go change into some flats .
oh , go right ahead .
shall i open a bottle ?
what a wonderful reception .
yes .
i only wish that blair and louis had not snuck out
without saying good @-@ bye .
i know .
perhaps they were overwhelmed with well @-@ wishers .
i have an idea .
why don &apos;t we invite the newlyweds
to stop by here before they leave for their honeymoon ?
louis has turned his cell phone off ,
but maybe you could reach blair .
i doubt we could catch them .
well , how will you know until you try ?
honestly , after the day that they have had ,
i &apos;m sure that they would prefer to be by themselves ,
and you know what ? i &apos;m kind of beat .
perhaps i should go home .
but rufus has just opened a bottle of wine .
it would be rude to leave now .
just one glass , at least .
and i &apos;ve opened one of our favorites .
after all , it is a special occasion .
ah , ladies , please make yourself at home .
will you excuse me ? hello ?
dad , it &apos;s me . hey . uh , don &apos;t tell anyone i &apos;m calling ,
and please don &apos;t freak out ,
but i &apos;m at the airport right now with blair .
she &apos;s going to the dominican republic
to get a divorce .
what are you talking about ?
you just gotta trust me .
she--she made a terrible mistake marrying louis ,
and he &apos;s not at all who he seems ,
so she &apos;s gotta flee the country
to make sure he doesn &apos;t find out where she is .
and--and you &apos;re going with her ?
no , no , i &apos;m just helping out ,
which is why i &apos;m calling .
i need you to help make sure that louis and his family
don &apos;t know that she &apos;s trying to leave the city .
i mean , i &apos;m sure they &apos;re already looking for her ,
and it &apos;s only a matter of time before they think to look here .
i &apos;m with sophie and eleanor now .
um , they think she &apos;s with louis .
oh , good . well , then keep it that way
as long as possible .
i don &apos;t think blair should be dragging you into this .
she needs me , dad .
if--if you could see how upset she is ,
you would understand .
please , please ,
just stall them .
all right , i trust you &apos;re doing the right thing .
i &apos;ll do what i can to help .
hey . your battery &apos;s about to die .
i know . i just had to use a pay phone
to ask my dad to buy us more time .
you told rufus ?
that goody @-@ goody will squeal the first chance he gets .
oh , you trust dorota ?
i pay her to stay loyal .
rufus is always doing the right thing .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s already told my mother ,
which means everyone will instantly know that she knows .
she refuses to get botox .
her face is an emoticon .
louis won &apos;t find out , all right ?
listen , i @-@ i don &apos;t think that you fully comprehend
the urgency of my situation .
you know what everyone says
they did to charlene wittstock
when she tried to run , and she was an olympian .
okay , these people don &apos;t mess around .
i need to resolve this
as quickly and as quietly as possible .
you &apos;ll be fine . rufus and dorota
are the only two people who know where we are ,
and i guarantee they won &apos;t tell a soul .
going somewhere ?
since miss blair gone on honeymoon ,
i ... take small trip myself .
with your employer &apos;s vuitton .
i don &apos;t think so .
i tell you nothing .
we &apos;ll see about that .
you remember when your husband took me
on that small trip to russia ?
it &apos;s payback time .
careful , b. loyalty &apos;s only worth so much
until there &apos;s a bigger price on your head .
still no word from blair ?
no .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sure they &apos;re in the air by now ,
champagne toasting
at 30,000 feet as we speak .
do you honestly expect me to believe that ?
excuse me ?
louis is in a limo downstairs ,
and blair is nowhere to be found .
enough with the niceties .
tell me where she is .
i &apos;m sorry . where is my daughter ?
i will not stand for the humiliation
of my son being left on his wedding day .
if you cannot get blair to return ,
then you will be required to fulfill the dowry
that we so generously waived .
first of all , i thought my daughter was with your son .
and as for the dowry , it was waived
because it &apos;s antiquated and outrageous .
you cannot force us to pay it .
it &apos;s all in the prenuptial agreement .
if she defaults on the marriage ,
the dowry can be reinstated .
so it is everyone &apos;s best interests
for blair to return .
how am i supposed to get blair to return
if i don &apos;t know where she is ?
ah , i &apos;m sorry that took so long .
my new loeffler randalls had scuff marks on them ,
but they came right off .
so ... what did i miss ?
i was just about to tell everyone
that the flower arrangements at the reception
were so beautiful , i thought we each should have one .
so i ... called over to catering ,
and they &apos;re sending some over .
oh , what a lovely idea .
well , they should be here any minute ,
so while we wait , who wants more wine ?
thank you for your hospitality ,
but i &apos;m afraid i must be going .
i was hoping to avoid this ,
but ... if you won &apos;t tell me where she is ,
i have other ways of finding out .
everything okay ?
oh , yeah , my boss wants me to help with something ,
but i &apos;m off the clock , so he can find someone else .
yeah , i &apos;m so glad we &apos;re done . i &apos;m just exhausted
after all that work we had to do .
you know , i like a man who can make a good martini .
but i could actually go for a cold beer right now .
do you have one , or is that too blue collar for you ?
of course . hold on .
hello ?
hi , mom .
no , that &apos;s because i &apos;m at the library
studying for a marketing exam .
no , the snowstorm &apos;s not that bad , i promise .
it &apos;s , like , not even a foot .
yeah . can i call you back when i &apos;m done ?
okay . bye .
who &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s my boss again .
doesn &apos;t like to take no for an answer , i guess .
yeah . well , uh , hey , listen ,
i &apos;m really sorry to do this ,
but i actually am exhausted
after the wedding and blair missing .
it &apos;s just kind of all hitting me right now , so ...
oh , okay .
that &apos;s probably for the best .
maybe i &apos;ll do that job after all .
it was stupid of me to turn down the extra money .
i &apos;ll just put this back .
did you find anyone for that job ?
we &apos;re now live on manhattan &apos;s upper east side
with prince louis grimald of monaco .
what is it ? is dorota here ?
no , it &apos;s louis .
where ?
as most of you know ,
blair waldorf and i
were married in a ceremony earlier today .
mere hours after our &quot; i dos ... &quot;
he must know i left manhattan .
i told you rufus would rat me out .
blair has now been reported a missing person .
at this time , we are doing everything we can to locate her ,
but we need your help .
blair is an extraordinary woman ,
but after a recent personal tragedy ,
and the stress surrounding a wedding of this magnitude ,
she has not been herself .
if anyone sees her ,
please contact the authorities immediately .
i can &apos;t believe it . they went to the press .
i thought they wanted to avoid embarrassment .
no , this way ,
they can spin it so that i look crazy .
so why not go to the press yourself ?
no , they still win .
they find me , they find a way to stop me .
we should go right now .
but where ? we can &apos;t go back to the city .
the next flight out is tomorrow morning .
i &apos;ll find a hotel
and text dorota to meet us there .
is there a four seasons in queens ?
well , at least we know she hasn &apos;t fled the country .
mr. chuck .
i was only trying them on . i was ...
so bored locked inside .
thankfully , miss georgina a mother
and she--she not leave me without snacks .
georgina did this to you ?
she wants to find miss blair , but not to worry .
i tell her wrong place .
you know where blair is ?
yes , miss blair was at airport
but now going to hotel waiting for me to bring passport .
something about elizabeth taylor .
oh , my god . blair wants a divorce .
that is my hope . before i was locked in closet ,
mr. louis was calling and calling .
he said he want to find miss blair
and get her help she needs , which in romance novels ,
means locking her forever in tall tower .
i need to get miss blair her passport
so she can get away very fast .
we &apos;ll take it from here .
i told you it wouldn &apos;t be long . follow that car .
sometimes when you want things done right ,
you have to rely on others to do them for you .
looks like we succeeded in finding blair
by using the press .
photos of her with the airport
are surfacing all over the internet .
where is she now ?
she was seen leaving the airport 20 minutes ago .
that &apos;s the last account .
did eleanor give you any information ?
either she knows absolutely nothing
or she is a talented liar .
either way , i have made it quite clear
that they will pay
if blair continues this charade .
so what do we do now ?
is it blair ?
no , it &apos;s from ...
&quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i think the hotel clerk recognized me .
did you notice him staring ?
you mean after you lectured him
about their lack of spa amenities ?
i can &apos;t believe that in just a few short hours ,
i went from being a princess with a private jet and a palace
to flying coach and hiding out in an airport hotel room
with ... dan humphrey .
what have i done to deserve this ?
how about what i &apos;ve done ?
like be there for you completely and without question ,
and you still treat me like crap .
would it kill you to be just the tiniest bit appreciative ?
in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i &apos;m not exactly having fun either .
this was supposed to be the best day of my life ,
and now it &apos;s a big mess ,
and you don &apos;t need to be yelling at me on top of it !
if you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i &apos;ve been helping you the entire time ,
and you &apos;re the one who &apos;s yelling !
all right , now i &apos;m yelling , too , but you started it .
i hope someone yells at you on your big day
so you know how it feels !
you already did ! you remember the day my book came out ?
you blamed me for creating all your problems with louis ,
and you never even read it .
i read the most important part--
the part that never happened .
look , all i &apos;ve ever tried to do was be your friend ,
but friends don &apos;t treat each other the way you treat me ,
so if you really think you &apos;re better off without me ,
then why don &apos;t you try it out ?
that &apos;s right . go ahead and leave .
i didn &apos;t want you in the car , and i don &apos;t need you now .
fine .
fine .
good @-@ bye .
bye !
that &apos;s not a dorota knock .
she &apos;s a stickler for &quot; shave and a haircut . &quot;
i &apos;m so sorry , eleanor .
i &apos;m sure that blair will turn up soon .
i thought she &apos;d be on her way to bali by now .
i just wish that she felt that she could have turned to me
if she was having second thoughts .
not knowing where she is or if she &apos;s okay--
that &apos;s the hardest part .
blair &apos;s fine . she &apos;s with dan .
how long have you known this ?
he called earlier .
i &apos;m sorry . i wanted to tell you ,
but i promised dan that i wouldn &apos;t say anything .
there are enormous consequences if she doesn &apos;t return .
i have to speak to her immediately .
where is she ?
dan ?
humphrey ?
what are you guys doing here ?
funny . we were just about to ask you the same thing .
where &apos;s blair ?
i &apos;m right here .
how did you find me ? you didn &apos;t tell louis , did you ?
dorota said you needed your passport .
the dominican republic ? really ? are you seriously doing this ?
louis doesn &apos;t care about me .
all he wants is to hold me hostage .
so you ran away with humphrey , and he brought you here ?
no . well , i was just leaving .
wait , wait , wait . you knew we were looking for blair .
why did you lie to us ?
she told me not to tell anyone .
well , i didn &apos;t know you talked to her .
you do realize she falls under the term &quot; anyone , &quot; right ?
i &apos;m not just anyone . i &apos;m her best friend .
how--what--how am i the bad guy here ?
she dragged me into all this .
technically , i just wanted the car .
all right , well , now that your real friends are here to help you ,
i &apos;m gonna leave .
oh , oh , group shot .
no .
seriously , georgina ?
i &apos;m outta here .
serena , you found my camera .
and here i thought it and its touching movie
of blair and chuck were gone for good .
well , at the very least ,
i guess this solves who sent in that video to &quot; gossip girl &quot;
and ruined blair &apos;s marriage .
my work here is done ...
and documented . thank you .
lily , i wanted to tell you .
well , no need to apologize to me ,
but poor eleanor .
she &apos;s probably upset because her daughter doesn &apos;t trust her
as much as dan trusts you .
let &apos;s just hope he continues to trust me
after eleanor shows up to drag blair home .
well , telling her was the right thing to do .
hi . i &apos;m lola from the catering company .
where do you want these ?
charlotte rhodes ?
uh , my husband and i were looking for my niece
with the same name , remember ?
oh , yeah . hi .
hi .
did you ever find her ?
she was with her mother .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re delivering the flowers .
did you work the grimaldi wedding ?
yeah .
small world .
yeah , it &apos;s just a part @-@ time gig while i &apos;m in school .
pays for the dorm .
honey . ahem .
oh ! yeah , let me take those .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry to drag you here so late .
oh , no , don &apos;t worry about it . i get the overtime ,
and , actually , you saved me from something
with this guy that i met at the wedding .
oh , is everything okay ?
yeah . i broke two of my own rules--
no dating party guests
and no dating guys named nate , luke , or troy .
usually lacrosse players , always trouble .
you don &apos;t ... mean nate archibald ?
oh , yeah . you know him ?
yes , very well . he &apos;s actually a lovely young man .
maybe so . all i know is , as soon as i showed interest ,
suddenly he lost any he had .
it &apos;s fine . he &apos;s a &quot; nate . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna head back and help the cleanup crew ,
but it was nice seeing you again .
you , too .
it was you who sent in that video to &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
and set me up to take the fall ?
um ... yeah .
yeah , fine . it was , um ...
it was me who did it , but i did it for the two of you .
you ruined my wedding ... for me ?
i know you never believed in my pact ,
but this wasn &apos;t your choice to make .
i didn &apos;t do it to hurt you , blair .
but you choosing to run away with dan ,
knowing how i feel about him
and not telling me any of it-- that hurt , too .
i can charter a plane .
we can be in the dominican republic by sunrise .
chuck ...
blair will not be going anywhere with anyone but my son .
uh @-@ oh , b. looks like you were right about their royal reach .
hope your plane ticket &apos;s refundable .
not even a day into your marriage ,
and already in breach of your prenuptial agreement
with your illicit lover .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
how did you find me ?
did rufus sell me out ? or is one of the buttons
on my wedding dress actually a gps locator ?
i wouldn &apos;t put it past you people .
you are the princess of monaco . privacy is no longer an option .
but you should be used to that by now .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; seems to know more about you than your own mother .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; told you she was here ?
i &apos;m not going back with you .
i &apos;m afraid you must .
my son awaits your return in the city ,
but if you refuse to join him ,
you and your family will quite literally pay the consequence .
or did you forget about the dowry ?
a dowry ? what century do you think this is ?
if you don &apos;t recall , the price is pretty steep .
i imagine your mother will be forced to sell her company .
so it is up to you .
do you prefer to spend the next year as a princess ...
or as a pauper ?
i can find somewhere else to wait for my car .
no , serena , hold on . look .
i only lied to you to help blair .
she was--she was panicked and running away from her wedding .
i was just trying to protect her from louis .
well , if you were really trying to help ,
then you would have told me ,
because i could have helped her , too .
but you saw the chance to be her only savior ,
her knight in shining armor .
i won &apos;t apologize for helping a friend .
and apparently , you &apos;re not gonna apologize
for lying to one , either .
are you really mad about blair ,
or is this about us ?
about what you said at the wedding ,
and because i haven &apos;t given you an answer yet ?
you just did .
i &apos;m sorry i blamed you for releasing that video .
it &apos;s understandable .
everyone knows i &apos;m the obvious choice .
i &apos;m just glad you know it wasn &apos;t me who did it ,
and now we can get out of here and start over .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll protect you from louis
and whatever his mother threatens to do .
if there &apos;s a dowry , i &apos;ll pay it .
i can &apos;t let you buy my freedom .
if it means getting rid of them ,
it &apos;s worth whatever the cost .
i &apos;d do anything for you .
no . not like this . i ...
i made a promise , and i need to keep it .
to god ?
please .
you broke that promise when you left louis .
and look , i &apos;m still standing .
chuck , i need you to let me handle this on my own .
what kind of chance do we have if our fresh start
is you buying me from louis ?
when and if we end up together ,
it has to be as equals ,
with nothing over our heads .
that &apos;s the only shot we have .
i can &apos;t stand the thought of you with anyone else .
i don &apos;t care what it costs or where we have to go .
i just wanna be with you .
louis won &apos;t lay a hand on me , i promise .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is ... how it has to be .
if you &apos;re looking for serena , she &apos;s , uh ,
she &apos;s on her way back to the city .
i was looking for you .
i want to apologize .
everything you said was right .
i could never have survived this last month without you .
i also know you wrote those vows .
well , you know , louis asked me to .
i @-@ i just--i just tried to write down
what i assumed he would love about you .
well , you did a great job .
it &apos;s pretty obvious you care way more about me than louis .
as a friend , of course .
no , of course .
and i care about you , too ,
even if i have odd ways of showing it like ,
you know , bossing you around or making fun of your hair .
seriously , you should cut it already .
thank you for helping me .
and i really am sorry for maxing out your credit card
and not reading your book .
well , listen , you have much bigger problems to deal with .
speaking of , what now ?
i know what i have to do , but i just need to know
that you &apos;ll be there for me .
always .
i was hoping i &apos;d find you back here .
how did you ...
lily called me . she said i might owe you an explanation
for ending our date .
oh , it wasn &apos;t a date , and you don &apos;t .
well , i think i do .
truth is , i have a history with girls who lie ,
and you seemed really honest and straightforward ,
which i liked .
but then i overhead a conversation with your mom ,
and , uh ...
my mom .
where to begin ?
well , to start , she &apos;s insanely overprotective .
she never wanted me to be an actress
and said that new york would destroy my soul .
so ... i lie and tell her that i &apos;m at michigan state ,
poli @-@ sci major .
i love her , but i &apos;m doing it to protect her ... and myself .
i don &apos;t know . family can be tricky .
no , i know . i just went through this huge thing
with my grandfather and my cousin ,
and suddenly i &apos;m left with no family at all , so ...
i can relate .
although my cousin did try and have me killed ,
so maybe our situations are slightly different .
but i &apos;m sorry .
i should have asked you earlier .
how about a do @-@ over ?
well , if i &apos;m being honest , um ...
it &apos;s really fun to hear about your world ,
but i don &apos;t know if wanna be in it .
no , i understand .
so , uh , thank you for being honest .
there you are . i &apos;ve been looking for your mother .
she isn &apos;t here .
well , i &apos;ll just have to tell you . i know where blair is ,
and i have no intention of sharing that information
with any of the grimaldis .
in fact , when i see her ,
i am going to tell her i don &apos;t care what i have to sell .
i want her to stay as far away from you as possible .
in fact , for future reference ,
the waldorfs do not give in to threats .
your family cannot control mine .
yes , they can .
louis ...
i &apos;m ready to go on our honeymoon now .
my bags are in the car downstairs .
blair , you do not have to do this .
you do not have to go with him .
yes , i do .
i heard what you said , mother ,
but i don &apos;t believe in saving myself
and ruining our family at the same time .
it &apos;s just a year .
it &apos;s not that long , right ?
sweetheart .
everything okay ?
fine .
thank you for bringing that up ...
and for everything else .
i meant what i said .
whatever you need , i &apos;m here for you .
we need to go .
don &apos;t look so sad , b.
at least your prison is a palace .
wait . you &apos;re posting a video of blair with louis ?
what about the photo of everyone at the airport hotel ?
isn &apos;t that the scoop you were looking for ?
no . that photo has been rendered irrelevant
due to the fact that blair and louis are together right now ,
leaving for their honeymoon .
but tomorrow &apos;s another day .
you forget i know who sent the video
of blair and chuck to &quot; gossip girl &quot; in the first place .
but you can &apos;t reveal your source .
everyone would stop sending tips .
oh , darling , of course they would ,
which is why i have something else planned .
my dear , sweet philip .
since gossip girl abandoned her post after blair &apos;s accident ,
it &apos;s been my civic duty to step in
and continue her important work .
it &apos;s a dirty job , but someone &apos;s gotta do it .
the world needs gossip girl .
i &apos;m gonna grab a water .
why did she choose him ?
i would have done anything for her .
i know , but you shouldn &apos;t have sent that video in
to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
don &apos;t you mean you shouldn &apos;t have ?
come on , chuck . you can stop pretending now .
i found the camera where you left it in the bridal chamber ,
and i put it in my purse .
i figured it was worth lying and saying that i did it
if--if you two could be together again .
i wasn &apos;t lying .
i didn &apos;t do it .
but if--if you didn &apos;t do it , and i didn &apos;t , then who did ?
some secrets i &apos;ll never tell .
but most secrets make for excellent blackmail material .
that &apos;s how it goes on the upper east side .
