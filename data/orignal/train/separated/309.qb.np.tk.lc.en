that &apos;s it for tonight .
time to count the tip jar .
hand condom .
i can &apos;t believe you .
using protection is so five years ago .
this is williamsburg .
there &apos;s a good chance even the dollars have herpes .
well , if those singles have herpes ,
they should just lie about it till they get married
like everybody else does .
oh , good , you &apos;re still open .
oh , yes , we are . what can i get you ?
everything in the register .
oh , my god . it &apos;s a hipster hold @-@ up .
hand it over . i have a gun .
well , i have a death wish so that &apos;s not gonna work .
look , pal , we work at this cupcake window 2 : 00 to 4 : 00,
six nights a week ,
and that is after eight hours of slinging hash
at the diner next door for lousy minimum wage ,
which a bunch of rich politicians out in--
help me out .
washington .
what she said-- don &apos;t wanna raise .
then , we walk home to our illegal one bedroom apartment ,
get three hours of nyquil induced sleep
before we have to get back up and share a bowl
of spanish language cheerios .
it &apos;s the same thing but the &quot; c &quot; wears a sombrero .
so , no , i am not about to give you our hard @-@ earned money .
and if you &apos;re gonna shoot me , better aim good .
&apos;cause if you miss , i will climb over this counter ,
tear off your head , and it &apos;ll be our new tip jar .
yeah , i just robbed pizza pizza .
here &apos;s a $ 20 .
have a good night .
i have a way with people .
look , i just saw that our cupcake competition ,
&quot; brooklyn bitty bites , &quot; went out of business .
yup , it &apos;s being changed into a medical marijuana store .
i already have my hole @-@ punch card .
buy four brownies and the fifth buzz is free .
brooklyn bitty bites bit it !
yeah ! we won !
eat it , red haired lady and your asian daughter !
max , them going down right after the death
of the cupcake giant , &quot; crumbs , &quot; is scary .
it &apos;s like there &apos;s a serial killer out there
coming after cupcakes .
well , he should be easy to outrun ,
&apos;cause that &apos;ll be one fat dexter .
晚上是专杀坏人的连环杀手
seriously , we have a big problem .
i &apos;m back !
and there &apos;s our little problem .
wow , you don &apos;t usually see the ventriloquist &apos;s dummy
out of his suitcase alone .
hello , earl . hello , caroline .
hello , reason i do two hours of phone therapy
every wednesday before work .
so , did you all miss me ?
you were gone ?
&apos;cause i swear i just saw you yesterday .
wait , maybe that was a cat .
i was gone , people !
to san francisco for a convention .
the restaurant and diner association .
&quot; radass . &quot;
you were at something called &quot; radass &quot; in san francisco ?
are you sure it wasn &apos;t &quot; redass &quot; ?
i am not gay . i &apos;m restaurant curious .
i discovered an exciting new item for our menu .
no way . no new menu additions .
i already lie awake in bed
worrying about how high the food bar is here .
pick up ! pulled pork .
and it &apos;s good &apos; cause before i pulled it ,
i gave it a dry rub .
it &apos;s $ 4 toast .
$ 4 toast ?
that &apos;s $ 5 more than our toast is worth .
delicious , homemade artisan bread .
at first , i was reluctant to put something so big in my mouth .
but the hot butter drizzling down my chin
was my sticky reward .
han , that toast is trendy foodie food .
it &apos;ll die here , like my soul did .
our customers are just plain , normal people .
hey , everybody !
and sophie .
guess what ?
78 guys want me on tinder .
oh , 79 !
now it &apos;s 80 !
how long have you been on tinder ?
ten minutes !
oh , look , oh , my gosh !
this guy &apos;s a plumber . are you kidding me ?
yes , that &apos;s a match !
and this guy isn &apos;t even wearing a shirt !
that &apos;s another big yes !
oh , gosh , girls , i &apos;ll be over here ,
looking at boys in my booth .
hey , i know a girl who met her husband on tinder .
no , wait , she saw her husband on tinder .
hey , are wheelchairs sexy ?
i guess it depends on who &apos;s in one .
i say no .
hold the presses .
i just got a new tweet from my gal ,
kim kardashian .
oh , she just bought her some new boots in manhattan .
kim kardashian is epic .
she was on the cover of vogue . she &apos;s on fire .
so ? i &apos;ve been on fire .
that &apos;s the last time i try witchcraft for the free snacks .
i love the kardashians .
they &apos;re like the kennedys but with bigger asses .
text me next time .
this whole talking thing is insane .
hi !
who would i talk to about finding the owner
of max &apos;s homemade cupcakes ?
that &apos;s max . i &apos;m caroline .
we &apos;re the owners of this store .
and about four pairs of socks .
great . wonderful . such a cute shop .
would you be interested in having a popular--
yes .
i didn &apos;t finish my sentence .
sorry , i just haven &apos;t heard the word &quot; popular &quot; in so long .
oh , yeah , she &apos;s over .
she &apos;s the blockbuster video of people .
would you be interested in having
a popular reality show filmed here ?
y--
i &apos;m so sorry . i have to take this .
just a minute .
what ?
just say it already . come on .
max , this is great . think of the exposure .
i wonder which reality show it is .
ooh , maybe 16 and pregnant is doing
a &quot; where are they now &quot; segment and they found me .
or that one about you , &quot; here comes honey boobless . &quot;
主角甜心波波一家作风极品 备受争议
do you have any idea who i am ?
you just do what i say or you are out !
okay .
mommy loves you .
sorry , my baby &apos;s nigerian .
i mean , if you &apos;re gonna live here , learn the language .
jeez .
so what are we thinking ?
we &apos;d love it . we &apos;re in . what show ?
keeping up with the kardashians .
finally , god opens a door .
and i &apos;m closing a window .
max !
she &apos;s overwhelmed . big fan .
do you have a card ?
and listen , text me .
don &apos;t call . it freaks me out .
just give me one good reason
why we shouldn &apos;t keep up with the kardashians .
i &apos;ll give you five good reasons .
kim , kamber , klondike ...
and the little ones , krispy and kreme .
not even close .
fine . kim , kooky , kool @-@ aid ,
and the little ones , kaptain and kangaroo .
it &apos;s kim , kourtney , khloe , kylie , and kendall .
凯莉与肯达尔则是同母异父
that mother has some nerve , naming a kid
who &apos;s probably never even read a book &quot; kindle . &quot;
we need this .
everyone watches keeping up with the kardashians .
it &apos;s like dancing with the stars ,
也有过模特 宇航员 甚至视频网站红人参加
but without the stars .
so , dancing with the stars .
okay , tell me one good thing about this show that i hate ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ve never seen it .
well , it &apos;s all about this family
and their struggle to ...
keep up .
yeah , okay . i &apos;ve never seen it either .
sophie , thank you so much for letting us come up
after work to watch your tv .
max turned our old one into a bong .
that was another time i was on fire .
well , which episode do you want to watch ?
&quot; kim gets a new hat . &quot;
or &quot; kylie cries at coachella &quot; ?
or &quot; khloe gets a bikini wax &quot; ?
now that one &apos;s a classic .
how many of these do you have dvr &apos;d ?
well , i got 17 on this tv
and 53 on the one in the bedroom .
i like to go to sleep with the sound of kim &apos;s voice .
it &apos;s so comforting when she says ,
&quot; this is super awkward . &quot;
and you know , sometimes she arches her back
when she says it , like this .
&quot; this is super awkward . &quot;
this is super awkward .
you know , i bet you if i stayed in poland ,
my sisters and i would have had our own show .
it would &apos;ve been called , keeping up with the kachinskis .
it &apos;s too bad we all didn &apos;t live to see 20 .
it &apos;s not cute .
you know i need someone to make me laugh .
where &apos;s kim ? kim is always late .
stop !
enough !
that &apos;s it , we &apos;re done .
hey , get the hell out ! it &apos;s morning !
i know , i know , but we couldn &apos;t stop
watching them do nothing .
this show is freaking genius !
is the blonde one crying ?
mm @-@ hmm . kris and kim are in vienna
and someone stole kris &apos;s bottega bag
and her chanel clutch with the matching pumps
that she bought in paris .
all right , well , i have to go take my morning tinkle .
but when i come back , i want you two to be out of here
because i need that swing for my exercises .
we have to do this show .
it &apos;ll be so great for our business .
the only way we &apos;d get more exposure
is if orlando bloom and bieber bitchslapped each other
而差点被揍 在网上引起轩然大波 普天同庆
in front of our shop .
who cares about our business ?
i want that mother to adopt me !
her kid makes a sex tape , she turns it into millions .
the only thing my mother ever did with my sex tape
was copy it and give it to her boyfriend .
i &apos;m so excited .
max , this is what i look like when i &apos;m happy .
you &apos;ve never seen it .
please call me by my new name ,
khlamydia kardashian .
don &apos;t say anything stupid like that .
i won &apos;t have to say anything .
kris will see me and recognize me as one of her own
with my lips , my boobs ,
and my willingness to live in some place called calabasas .
they &apos;re here . my life changes now !
this is what i look like happy .
you &apos;ve never seen it .
hi , we are so , so excited about this .
there has been a change .
they &apos;re not coming .
it &apos;s too far to walk in heels .
see ? she might as well have been my real mom
&apos;cause she just chose a heel over me .
hi , here i am to meet kiki , my bff .
and look at my new dress ! twinsies !
they certainly are .
sorry , she &apos;s not coming .
we had to film them in jamba juice instead .
well , this is super awkward .
stupid kardashians !
kim , kankels , krank ,
and the little ones , kegel and kickball ,
you can kiss my keister .
max , stop it ! i &apos;m trying to sleep .
well , sorry , but i &apos;m pissed and it &apos;s 11 : 30 anyway .
what &apos;s going on ?
even one tweet from kim would have exposed us
to 22 million followers .
scientology doesn &apos;t even have those numbers .
they screwed us .
i know .
that is why i &apos;m making hate cupcakes
for the kardashians , see ?
&quot; eat it , &quot; &quot; bite me , &quot;
and these three ... &quot; get &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; job . &quot;
oh , and one for the mom that says , &quot; i still love you , &quot;
just in case .
now come on , get up .
your son needs to go out and take an 8 @-@ foot crap .
no , i &apos;m done .
if everyone &apos;s done with cupcakes , so am i.
i &apos;m done pretending that everything &apos;s gonna work out .
in our reality show , it &apos;s not .
look , get up , or i will close this bed with you in it ,
and your new reality show will be true life :
i live in a wall .
i &apos;m not getting up . ever .
max , stop , stop it ! stop it !
put me down ! put me down !
what &apos;s happening ?
i can &apos;t lift my head .
did i have a stroke ?
calm down . no one has stroked in your bed
since--what is it , going on a year ?
max . my hair is caught .
my hair is caught ! my hair is caught !
who are you yelling at ?
the whole situation ! do something !
let me look .
oh yeah , it &apos;s all caught up in the bed gears here .
oh my god , i have a bed with gears
and my hair is caught in it !
ooh , nope .
it &apos;s really all stuck up in there .
it &apos;s so odd .
i don &apos;t know how a thing like this could happen .
uh , you put me up into the wall .
and now i &apos;m trapped in a murphy bed
like some welfare rapunzel .
stop panicking , i &apos;ll get a scissors .
oh , yeah , yeah ! get the scissors .
then plunge &apos; em into my heart
&apos;cause i &apos;d rather die than cut my hair .
okay , max , i think i have something that might work ,
but you have to promise me
that you will never bring this up again .
what ? the fact that your head is stuck to your bed ?
sorry , that &apos;s coming up again .
go into my nightstand
and get my cinnamon @-@ flavored make @-@ up remover .
you mean the lube ?
can we please call it make @-@ up remover ?
please ! i need us to do that .
it &apos;s almost empty .
man , you &apos;ve removed a lot of make @-@ up .
stop it ! just squeeze some out
and put it on the parts that we need to move .
yeah , i &apos;m familiar .
please tell me it &apos;s working .
i &apos;m trying , but ...
i don &apos;t think i can get your hair out .
good news is , i think we can fit a penis in there .
who could that be ?
a rapist we &apos;ve done most of the work for .
oh , we were just talking about you .
max , you gotta help me with the bread for han &apos;s toast .
i &apos;ve already burned ten of these .
turns out the only thing i can successfully bake is meth .
oleg , come to the bed . i need you !
all right !
only took you four years , but i &apos;m here , baby .
no , it &apos;s not like that , oleg .
just get over here !
okay .
hold this .
earl , what are you doing here ?
oleg called me when he couldn &apos;t get caroline
to stop the screaming .
hi , max . earl gave me part of a brownie .
turns out , glaucoma and having hair stuck
take the exact same prescription .
look !
that &apos;s right , you mothers !
i did it !
i made the perfect bread !
you &apos;re a chef who took 19 hours to make one loaf of bread .
stephen hawking was more successful at the 100 @-@ yard dash .
and you-- you are aware
that i went all the way into manhattan ,
cupcake @-@ bombed kim kardashian &apos;s hotel ,
and you &apos;re still just laying here , right ?
didn &apos;t you have to pee ?
i held most of it in .
this is crazy . you &apos;ve been here all day .
let &apos;s just cut your damn hair already .
i wouldn &apos;t be me without my hair .
i can &apos;t live without it .
yes , you can .
you have lived without money ,
you &apos;ve lived without electricity ,
you &apos;ve lived without plumbing .
what do you think got me through it ?
my hair .
i &apos;d be like , &quot; lost all my money , the toilet &apos;s clogged ,
still got my hair . &quot;
darling , i don &apos;t think those brownies are kicking in .
i also have some lollipops .
i hope you &apos;re happy .
i didn &apos;t see anything through the peep @-@ hole ,
so i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s han .
ah , hello !
i have an open diner and no diner staff !
han , look , i made perfect bread .
it &apos;s bigger than i &apos;m used to .
let me just take a minute and breathe .
and i &apos;m sure i can take it all in .
well , if you need any help ,
caroline &apos;s got some make @-@ up remover .
kiki tweet , kiki tweet , kiki tweet !
she &apos;s saying &quot; kiki tweet &quot; !
how did he understand that ? is he part dolphin ?
kim kardashian tweeted a pic of my mean cupcakes
and said , &quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes # notcool . &quot;
oh , my god , kim kardashian hates someone i know !
that went out to 22 million people !
i &apos;m so sorry .
why ?
do you know how many people can &apos;t stand the kardashians ?
our cupcake window will be packed !
cut me loose .
hey , caroline , we &apos;re finally about to scissor .
are you sure ?
we got a business to run .
cut it , i &apos;ll be fine .
yeah , you &apos;re gonna need that lollipop .
yeah , i know , those kardashians are the worst .
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t keep up with them anymore .
all right , max . okay , that &apos;s it .
just one left . not bad .
and your hair &apos;s not bad either .
yeah , now ,
after the emergency trip to that salon .
when you got done with me ,
i looked like a baby bird on chemo .
i &apos;m sorry i had to use the last of our savings for my hair cut .
no , you &apos;re not .
no , i am not , i love this .
hi , i &apos;m kim .
i just wanted to say sorry
that we didn &apos;t film here the other day .
it almost hurts to look at her .
i know how hard us girls really work
to keep our businesses going ,
so i &apos;ll take a cupcake
and i &apos;ll totally tweet about it for real .
thank you so much .
here , here , here , here , here .
we can &apos;t break a $ 100 , and anyway ,
this is so on the house .
oh , thanks .
cute hair .
wait . real quick ...
do you think your mother would adopt me ?
this is super awkward .
