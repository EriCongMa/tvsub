she is the star of the play , and she is my girlfriend .
i get to have sex with the star of the play !
people can hear you .
i know !
she looks great , doesn &apos;t she ?
that is one good @-@ looking man .
is it just me , or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat ?
so you been doing this long ?
no . you &apos;re my first . put the money on the table .
that &apos;s nice .
dude !
ls that an expensive blouse ?
lf you want it to be .
here &apos;s your girlfriend &apos;s button .
the one with rachel &apos;s crush
do you still have your old blouses and dresses from high school ?
yeah , i think i have some around here somewhere . why ?
maternity clothes are so expensive .
rach , i made a pile of your stuff . if you could just ...
... throw your purses at it .
bloomingdale &apos;s eliminated my department .
are you out of a job ?
no , but they stuck me in personal shopping , which is a huge step down .
what is that ?
where you walk around with rich people and tell them what to buy ?
that sounds great !
we switched apartments .
you can &apos;t eat our food . that gravy train has ended .
there &apos;s gravy ?
if you have the big apartment , you have to deal with people coming over .
that fridge has to be stocked . that &apos;s your apartment now .
what are you doing ?
i think i left a doughnut up here .
how was kathy &apos;s play ?
kathy gets half @-@ naked and simulates sex with a real good @-@ looking guy .
it &apos;s like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare ...
... and then charged me $ 32 to see it .
that &apos;s a good idea for a business .
i &apos;m totally screwed . they &apos;re gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night ...
... then they &apos;ll go to their cast parties , and he &apos;s gonna try to undermine me .
he &apos;ll be like , &quot; where &apos;s your boyfriend ? what &apos;s his name ? chester ? &quot;
she &apos;ll go , &quot; it &apos;s chandler . &quot; he &apos;ll go , &quot; whatever ! &quot;
that is a good trick .
all right , look . what am i going to do ?
they &apos;re actors . they &apos;re there to do a job .
it doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re gonna get together .
just because it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gonna happen with them .
alec baldwin and kim basinger .
tom cruise and nicole kidman .
mel gibson and clint eastwood .
they &apos;re not a couple .
i get the game now .
all these people were in movies together . it &apos;s much different with plays .
you were in acting class together , and she slept with you .
acting class is a lot more like a movie than a play .
when they were doing it on stage , was it really hot ?
oh , yeah .
so you &apos;re fine .
the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off @-@ stage ...
... then all the sexual tension between them is gone .
as long as it &apos;s hot on stage , you got nothing to worry about .
when the heat goes away , that &apos;s when you &apos;re in trouble .
really ?
you guys have been to every play i &apos;ve been in . have i ever had chemistry on stage ?
no .
no !
are you gonna go see the play with me tonight ?
i don &apos;t know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between them .
i know , but
no , i &apos;m there .
want some pancakes ?
you made pancakes ?
grab a plate .
no , no . stay right there .
getting closer .
don &apos;t worry ... we also have cereals , muffins , waffles and
... jams , jellies and marmalades , which i &apos;m sure are the same thing .
please eat , because joey opened everything .
we &apos;re watching the game here saturday night , if people wanna come over .
i was thinking about having people over.yeah ? who &apos;s playing ?
the players .
somebody seems to be missing being the hostess .
please . it &apos;s a relief , is what it is , is what it is .
pheebs , stick out your plate .
monica , i &apos;m quitting .
i just helped an 81 @-@ year @-@ old woman put on a thong , and she didn &apos;t even buy it .
i &apos;m quitting.i &apos;m talking to my boss right now .
yes , i am . yes , i am .
okay , bye . call me when you get this message .
mr. waltham ? i really need to talk to you .
in a moment , please . i &apos;m in the middle of a task .
and you have a customer .
hi.hi , i &apos;m joshua .
i &apos;m rachel greene . what could i do for you , joshua ?
i need a whole new wardrobe . my wife well , my ex @-@ wife
i &apos;m so sorry .
anyway , she burned all of my clothes .
i got away with this suit and what turned out to be a skirt .
well , at least that &apos;s a great suit .
it wasn &apos;t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt .
i need everything down to underwear . if you &apos;re willing , i &apos;m all yours .
okay .
you needed to speak to me ?
no , no , that wasn &apos;t me .
we should get started . let me show you my underwear .
the selection of underwear that we carry .
i &apos;m sorry.-it &apos;s this way .
this way ? sorry .
i &apos;m right . right ? there was no chemistry between them .
before , they had heat . now , there &apos;s no heat .
you know what this means . joey told us what this means .
let &apos;s not jump to any conclusions . there was some sexual chemistry .
come on . it was like cousins having sex .
here she comes . don &apos;t say a word . just be cool . don &apos;t be , you know , you .
hey , you guys !
thank you so much for coming again .
did you like it tonight ?
absolutely .
wasn &apos;t nick funny when he couldn &apos;t get his match lit ?
it &apos;s a good play , isn &apos;t it ?
i loved the play . you were great.and nick , ditto .
clearly , you &apos;re having sex with him .
okay ....
clearly , i &apos;m having sex with him ?
it was so obvious . there was no chemistry between you two .
you &apos;re accusing me of cheating on you , and you &apos;re insulting my performance ?
i can see how this could happen . you &apos;re up there every night naked , touching , kissing .
acting . chandler , this is my job .
i &apos;m playing a part in a play . how can you not trust me ?
you can understand , given how we started .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re throwing that in my face .
that is what happened . i don &apos;t even see you denying this .
i &apos;ll tell you what , chandler . you call me when you grow up .
don &apos;t expect that to happen any time soon !
i have the best job in the entire world !
the most adorable guy came over , and i got to dress him up all day !
rachel has a new doll !
i wish he was a doll . i &apos;d get a rachel doll and bump them together ...
... and make kissing noises .
he &apos;s got the most beautiful name . i never realized . joshua .
joshua.joshua. josh .
what do i smell ?
i don &apos;t know . it smells good .
fresh cookies ! hot from the oven .
please , have some .
i &apos;ve been fiddling around here , making delicious treats for everyone .
the new playboy.just something i picked up .
cookies and porn ? you &apos;re the best mom ever !
what ?
it &apos;s just something joshua said about v @-@ necks , but you had to be there .
how does jason look in a v @-@ neck ?
it &apos;s joshua . -whatever .
wait . wait . this isn &apos;t takeout !
hate to eat and run .
no , wait . please , don &apos;t go ! i &apos;ve got porn for you too .
i don &apos;t need it .
people are supposed to want to hang out here .
why ? what is the big deal ?
i &apos;m the hostess .
not those guys . i &apos;m always the hostess .
even when i was little , the girls brought their dollies to my tea party .
i served the best air .
why &apos;d you make a big thing out of everyone hanging out in the big apartment ?
&apos;cause they took our apartment . i wanted to punish them .
i &apos;m done now . they &apos;ve suffered enough .
if you wanted to punish them , you should have just made them hang out here.that is true .
all right ! this place is gonna be 10 times better than that place .
are we gonna trash their place ?
there &apos;s steps !
slut !
you &apos;ll all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy !
what ?
you were right ?
i confronted her , and she didn &apos;t deny it .
i don &apos;t live here !
wait , are you sure ?
i may be drunk , but i know what she said .
then i went over to beefsteak chewley &apos;s ....
beefsteak charlie &apos;s ?
yes !
you and l have always been like :
man , i am so sorry .
the bartender taught me a trick , though .
i don &apos;t remember it .
do you need help with that ?
i got it .
i just feel bad . i never vacuum .
i was with joshua for an hour today , and he has not asked me out .
just so frustrating .
why don &apos;t you ask him out ?
totally . that &apos;s such a turn @-@ on .
really ? it doesn &apos;t seem desperate ?
that &apos;s the turn @-@ on .
he just got a divorce . right ? he &apos;s probably really nervous around women .
maybe you just need to make the first move .
i &apos;ve never asked a guy out before .
you &apos;ve never asked a guy out ?
no . have you ? thousands of times !
that doesn &apos;t make me sound too good , does it ?
i don &apos;t even know how i would go about it .
what i do is , i look a woman up and down , and i say ...
&quot; hey . how you doing ? &quot;
oh , please !
hey . how you doing ?
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna do that . i &apos;m gonna call him up and ask him out .
i can do that , ask him out . &quot; how you doing ? &quot;
hi , joshua . it &apos;s rachel greene from bloomingdale &apos;s .
i was just wondering if you ... ?
... left your wallet at the store today ?
we found a wallet , and we
the license ? that is a good idea .
well , let &apos;s see . this license belongs to ...
... belongs to a mr. pheebs .
so sorry to bother you at home . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow . bye .
you &apos;ve done that a thousand times ?
i &apos;ve never done that .
i just got so nervous that he &apos;d say no .
you gotta give him something he can &apos;t say no to , like ... knicks tickets .
... invite him to a knicks game . you &apos;re guaranteed he &apos;ll say yes .
really ? you think that &apos;ll work ?
absolutely . and if not , can i go ?
what the heck is that ?
did she call ?
no . sorry .
maybe i should call her .
forget her , man . you don &apos;t need her .
he &apos;s right . what she did was unforgivable .
well , yeah , but , you know , what if i was wrong ?
how might you be wrong ?
what if she didn &apos;t actually sleep with the guy ?
tell me she told you this .
she didn &apos;t have to tell me . i saw the play . there was no heat .
back me up .
that &apos;s all you &apos;re basing this on ?
that &apos;s not backing me up !
look , you said , &quot; with the offstage and the heat &quot;
that was just a theory . there &apos;s a lot of theories that didn &apos;t pan out :
lone gunman , communism , geometry .
oh , my god !
&quot; would you like to go to a basketball game with ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s funny , basketball , because i happen to have tickets &quot;
&quot; who likes the knick ? &quot;
what do you think ?
well , as a single woman , who is available ...
... i think you look great .
oh , yeah . you look great .
this looks great .
so you like it ? i do . i love it .
in fact , i think i &apos;ll wear it home .
great .
thank you so much for all your help .
well , i guess this is it .
thanks.maybe i &apos;ll see you in the spring for the bathing suits .
you don &apos;t want to do that now ?
that &apos;s okay.i &apos;ll see you around sometime .
basketball !
sorry ?
i have two tickets to the knicks game if you &apos;re interested .... just as a thank @-@ you for this week .
that would be great !
really ?
that would be fantastic ! my nephew is crazy about the knicks !
this is fantastic . thank you so much , rachel .
good morning .
i just wanted to come over to say that i &apos;m sorry .
i acted like the biggest idiot in the world.i can completely understand why you were so upset .
i really wish you &apos;d called me.yeah , i know . i wish i had too .
i think this is a good thing .
we &apos;ve had our first fight , and now we can move on .
i know for me , but
nick &apos;s pants ?
i think our second fight is going to be a big one !
for next time , what do you say ?
&quot; l have an extra ticket . &quot; &quot; an extra ticket . &quot; not &quot; two tickets . &quot;
the first time you asked a guy out he turned you down ?
he didn &apos;t turn me down . he &apos;s at the game .
i got the date . i &apos;m just not on it .
okay , it &apos;s ready.come on .
what &apos;s ready ? just come .
oh , my god !
this is beautiful !
did you work for two days straight ?
pretty much .
what do you think of the floor ? i don &apos;t know . looks the same .
you used to have carpet.oh , yeah .
i made snacks .
please , just hang out.i &apos;m just gonna rest my eyes for just a little bit
do you want us to come back later ?
no , no , no . stay . just keep talking .
i &apos;m always the hostess .
how &apos;d it go ?
she wasn &apos;t sleeping with him .
good !
she is now .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that she is a devil woman .
you think you know a person , then they turn around and sleep with nick .
nick and his rock @-@ hard pecs and his giant man @-@ nipples .
i hate him . and i hate her .
i don &apos;t hate her . i love her . this is all my fault .
how ? how is it your fault ? i should have called .
if i had called her , she never would have gone out with nick .
they wouldn &apos;t have ended up in bed . i threw her at his man @-@ nipples !
this is not your fault.your fight does not justify her sleeping with someone .
well , if she thought they were on a break ....
rachel , one of your customers seems to have left his billfold ,
a joshua burgen.really ?
will you call him ?
yes , i will . absolutely .
hello , rachel.hi , joshua .
i left my wallet here on purpose .
really ?
yes . i just wanted to see you again.i &apos;m glad .
rachel , i &apos;d like to say something to you.yes ?
&quot; how you doing ? &quot;
