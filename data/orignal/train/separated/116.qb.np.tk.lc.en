* you look it up and down *

* as far as i can see *
* that much &apos;ll never change *

i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re suing the gun manufacturer ?
no , we &apos;re suing the designer of the 3 @-@ d gun
that malfunctioned and crippled our client .
so why would that make you a better state &apos;s attorney ?
actions speak louder than words .
i &apos;ve been actively pursuing
cases like this on gun control for ... years .
you &apos;ve also defended some pretty bad people , too--
for example , lemond bishop .
he &apos;s no longer a client .
to your knowledge , has lemond bishop contributed
to your campaign or your pac ?
no .
she &apos;s lying .
how do you know ?
because she used to represent bishop .
and you &apos;re giving her a free ride this saint crap .
uh , m @-@ martin , i benefit just as much as she does from ...
frank , she got the endorsement .
she lied , and she got the newspaper &apos;s endorsement .
that &apos;s a three @-@ point bump three days before the election .
so set up more events .
i &apos;m here ; i &apos;m ready .
is this another &quot; come to jesus &quot; moment ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t know how many more of these i can take , martin .
look , i like you , frank .
you &apos;re a good man , possibly even a great one ,
and i will do everything i can to help you win ...
but you are too nice .
she &apos;s a liar . she told them ...
exactly what they wanted to hear ,
and i &apos;ll bet you every dollar i have
they knew she was lying , they wanted her to lie--
because people respect someone who &apos;s willing
to lie for what they believe in .
it shows strength .
they don &apos;t respect the truth .
every time you said something self @-@ deprecatingly true
to that editorial board , they all patted you on the back
and then snickered behind their hands .
i won &apos;t smear her .
that &apos;s always what this comes down to .
i won &apos;t go against my principles .
you disagree with her ?
yes , on policy .
you disagree with her husband ?
yes .
there .
don &apos;t go after her ; go after him .
i &apos;m not running against her husband .
exactly , so there &apos;s no problem going after him .
he was corrupt .
what will going after her husband do ?
it will show what you &apos;re against .
campaigns aren &apos;t just about what you &apos;re for .
they &apos;re about what you &apos;re against .
so go after the husband .
for the , uh , uh ...
i &apos;m not leaving you in a lurch ;
will you stop saying that ?
blah , blah , or whatever .
please ? oh , so the whole ...
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . we &apos;re ...
we &apos;ve got a problem .
we can see that .
tell her the problem , jon .
okay .
uh , the first thing i &apos;ll do is clean house
and take a look at hiring
going back to peter florrick &apos;s administra--
so our tracker just picked this up outside the hotel .
what &apos;s wrong with it ?
peter florrick brought a new level of cronyism to the office ,
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ll need to root out .
uh , the office needs an upheaval ,
not the partial measures of mr. florrick .
okay , so he mentions peter eight times
in the space of whatever , a short time .
he &apos;s coming after you through your husband .
that &apos;s his way of getting around your ,
you know , little thing .
your agreement to not go negative .
so , what do i do , defend peter ?
no , that &apos;s exactly what they want .
i think the time has come
for you to separate yourself .
you need your sister soulja moment .
指大胆抨击同阵营的极端人物的时间
so i should criticize peter ?
yes , his issues .
what issues ?
doesn &apos;t matter , pick one .
god , this is like high school .
the key is to create a little space
between you and peter .
that way , prady can say whatever he wants ,
and none of it will land on you .
and what &apos;s the con ?
the con ?
why wouldn &apos;t i do this ?
the two of you were arguing before .
who &apos;s against it ?
no .
no , that &apos;s not what we were arguing about .
tell her , big man .
i &apos;ve been asked to join a campaign
in sacramento on the 7th .
the 7th of ... ?
this month ,
election day , but don &apos;t worry .
you are in great shape .
there &apos;s not really anything to be done
on the campaign at that point .
and this being chicago , you know ,
there &apos;s never any fraud at the polls .
come on , josh . that &apos;s not fair .
we &apos;ve got lawyers for exactly that kind of thing .
alicia ...
how &apos;s he doing on the stand ?
what ?
mcveigh , how &apos;s he doing on the stand ?
oh , i don &apos;t know , i haven &apos;t checked in .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m calling .
louis canning called you .
what ? why ?
uh , he wants to see you .
he &apos;s in icu , but we think it &apos;s a good idea .
we ? what do you mean ?
we think it &apos;s a good idea
for you to go and see him and get him to sign off
on his lawsuit against us .
while he &apos;s in the icu ?
yes .
you want me to pull an ashcroft .
get him to sign something when he &apos;s weak in the hospital ?
no , but you &apos;re going to the hospital anyway ,
so it would be good for the firm
if he accepted our reasonable offer .
look , just call me when you find out
how mcveigh &apos;s doing on the stand , okay ?
the firearm was devised through additive manufacturing ,
or as it &apos;s more popularly known , 3 @-@ d printing .
and it works from software ?
yes , open source file .
so if i type in the words ,
uh , &quot; 3 @-@ d printer gun &quot; right now ,
it would come up with a file just like that ?
yes , uh , mr. fife &apos;s design
is still currently on his web site .
so , once you &apos;ve downloaded
all the schematics for the gun ,
how difficult is it to print one ?
load a spool of plastic into a 3 @-@ d printer ,
push &quot; print . &quot;
that &apos;s it ?
yes , that &apos;s it .
well , dear god , that &apos;s appalling .
i mean , how long does it take to print ?
a gun , your honor ?
approximately four hours .
so , on january the 17 ...
and this gun , it fires actual bullets ?
yes , your honor .
and it &apos;s plastic ,
so you could get it through a , uh , metal detector .
yes , your honor .
well , thank god for the second amendment .
well , your honor , this technology has more
to do with the first amendment than the second .
no , no . not if the software can kill .
yes , but it &apos;s not the software that &apos;s killing .
your honor , if we could show you what happened next ?
yeah , yeah , of course . my apologies .
um , and i promise i won &apos;t let my bias impact my decision .
thank you , your honor .
you &apos;ve always been very fair ,
so we &apos;re counting on that .
so , mr. mcveigh , this is the gun that was taken
to the cantata vega shooting range ?
is that correct ?
yes .
and what happened at that range ?
the gun misfired
and sent shrapnel through an alley partition
and injured the spine of mr. summerfeldt .
so the misfire that paralyzed my client was foreseeable ?
yes , by someone with experience in printing
and testing 3 @-@ d printed guns .
and the shooter , carsten pope , did he have that experience ?
no , he had never printed
nor fired a gun like that before .
so who should &apos;ve known ?
the gun designer , mr. fife .
he is the expert here , he made the gun
readily available to the public . the responsibility is his .
thank you , mr. mcveigh . nothing further , your honor .
he &apos;s a good witness .
mr. mcveigh , how are you ?
i &apos;m good , thank you .
good . thank you very much
for taking us all through this technology .
it just seems to get more and more complicated ,
doesn &apos;t it ?
oh , yeah , it does .
and culpability , then , gets more and more complicated ,
because it goes through so many different hands .
objection , your honor .
ms. crozier seems to be confused
as to who is on the witness stand .
no .
i &apos;m just plain confused .
it &apos;s not like there &apos;s one manufacturer and one ...
your honor ?
yeah , um ...
sustained . is anybody else
really disturbed by all this ?
okay , okay , thank you .
that was rhetorical .
um , no more editorial content from me .
ms. crozier ?
thank you , your honor .
so , mr. mcveigh ,
the shooter , mr. pope ,
sitting right there , you &apos;re not suing him , right ?
actually , i &apos;m not suing anyone , ms. crozier .
you &apos;re just an expert witness
who happens to be married
to one of the plaintiff &apos;s attorneys .
sorry , let me rephrase that .
the shooter , mr. pope ,
the one that your wife is not suing ,
he built the gun
that injured eddie summerfeldt .
no .
no . no ?
he didn &apos;t ?
he didn &apos;t build it .
he printed it .
but you said that he didn &apos;t have any training in 3 @-@ d printing .
that &apos;s correct .
do you know where he made ...
or printed , the gun ?
in his garage .
and he spent $ 25 ?
god help us .
$ 22.50
in materials ,
and $ 1,795 for the printer .
well , i mean , i don &apos;t know much about guns .
you &apos;re the expert there ,
but i &apos;m still just trying to figure out why it is
you &apos;re suing my client ,
who &apos;s merely responsible for the design of the thing ,
and not the shooter , who actually printed
and fired the gun .
again , ma &apos;am , i &apos;m not suing anyone .
well , maybe you could just convince your wife ...
objection , your honor .
i &apos;ll sustain that .
i just , i @-@ i , i just can &apos;t believe it .
twenty @-@ five dollars .
how is it that you make me feel like i &apos;m 22 ?
how are you , mr. canning ?
i &apos;m alive .
but you got a new kidney .
yes .
sit , sit there .
so , were you elected ?
no .
oh , you lost .
no , it &apos;s just three days away .
i voted absentee .
thank you .
no , against you .
so , mr. canning , if you don &apos;t mind ...
this girl , this 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl ,
went to head a soccer ball at her junior league game ,
and , uh , her head
hit another girl &apos;s head ,
and she died .
she just ...
dropped to the field , dead .
and i don &apos;t even know her name .
but she gave me a kidney .
can you believe that ?
i can .
so , i swore to myself before i went into surgery
that i &apos;d do something for her .
if it worked out , if @-@ if it went well ,
and i lived that i would do something good .
for her family ?
yes .
i want to liquidate my stocks .
$ 18 million .
give them to her family .
will you do that for me ?
have you called your estate lawyer ?
yes , he &apos;s not returning my calls .
think he wants to wait till i &apos;m dead , and then ...
keep all the money in @-@ house .
who is your estate attorney ?
david lee .
i didn &apos;t put the file up to hurt people .
i put it up to protect them .
that you &apos;ll have to explain , mr. fife .
you wanted to protect my client
by providing schematics for guns
that are undetectable , untraceable and unregulated ?
yeah , and uncensorable .
so , this is all about the first amendment to you ?
yes . yes , your honor .
i @-@ i have the first amendment right
to put out whatever information i want ,
no matter how many laws are passed
to limit my rights under the second .
did you consider posting a warning ?
and you don &apos;t worry
about what crazy person might use your design ?
sure , i do , but i worry more
about what crazy person will become the next dictator .
and @-@ and what do dictators confiscate
even before the printing presses ? the guns .
all right , let &apos;s move on to ...
um , your honor ,
may mr. fife finish the answer ?
yes , he may .
3 @-@ d technology has made it impossible
for dictators to control firearms .
i can e @-@ mail a gun to any person
in the world in seconds .
a rebel fighter in syria ,
a dissident in china ,
a freedom fighter in pakistan .
this machine has made democracy possible worldwide .
it is the modern version
of the printing press .
look , i was watching him , okay , diane .
he &apos;s still on our side .
i don &apos;t know .
judge abernathy ends up feeling so guilty about his bias ,
he sometimes rules against it .
well , that &apos;s harder to do when the defendant is crazy .
we didn &apos;t make him crazy enough ?
yeah . let me .
you &apos;re not returning canning &apos;s calls .
actually , i am .
david , i just came from him .
he gave me power of attorney
to liquidate all his stocks
and give all $ 18 million to the family of the donor .
okay .
david ...
he wants it done now .
do you know the donor &apos;s family ?
no , but i &apos;m sure you can get it from the hospital .
i did get it from the hospital .
the farsouns-- izzat and helga .
their daughter &apos;s name was leila .
okay .
did you contact them ?
i did .
david , if you &apos;re waiting for mr. canning to die ,
i will bring you up on charges ...
they don &apos;t want the money for themselves .
they want to send it to a charity .
&quot; the strong arm of liberty . &quot;
strong arm of liberty support
the oppressed peoples of palestine .
you can &apos;t let your political bias impact your representation .
it &apos;s canning &apos;s choice .
and i &apos;ll facilitate his choice
after i get full indemnification ,
including a letter from the state department
saying this group is kosher .
appropriate .
it &apos;s not illegal to give to pro @-@ palestinian causes .
it is if they support hamas .
do they support hamas ?
it &apos;s too new for the state department to make a determination .
and i &apos;m not spending ten years
in a federal prison for aiding and abetting terrorists .
okay .
let me talk to canning ,
see if he wants to do other good works .
yes .
maybe he can find other ways of facilitating the killing of jews .
hello again , mr. fife .
hello back at you .
now , you made your firearm software open source
for a very good reason , isn &apos;t that right , mr. fife ?
you wanted to make it available to ... well , everyone .
yeah , everyone with a 3 @-@ d printer .
even felons ?
yes , if they could ...
objection , your honor . relevance .
the defense opened the door .
they argued their constitutional rights shielded them from culpability .
we merely want to explore that right .
yes , seems fair to me .
overruled .
you were saying , mr. fife ?
i just saw ms. crozier
making a signal to you , mr. fife .
would you care to explain ?
oh , no , i didn &apos;t .
well , i saw you making what i would interpret
to be a &quot; go @-@ easy &quot; gesture .
no , your honor , i simp ...
i was feeling heat coming from somewhere under ...
i don &apos;t know if there &apos;s a vent .
okay , okay .
okay , then , let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s all stop gesturing .
mr. fife seems perfectly capable of taking care of himself .
mr. fife .
yeah , yes .
if a felon could afford a 3 @-@ d printer ,
uh , he would have access to my software .
and children ?
would you make it available to children ?
it is available to children ,
as is porn , and @-@ and kim kardashian &apos;s ass ,
unless parents put parental control on their computers .
in fact , weren &apos;t you quoted as saying ,
&quot; i can &apos;t wait for the first school shooting
with a 3 @-@ d gun .
objection , your honor . argumentative .
i &apos;m just using his own words , your honor .
wait . wait . wait . wait , wait , wait wait , wait , wait , wait .
mr. fife , are these your own words ?
uh , if it was taken from an interview on noisy , yes .
but they &apos;re always taken out of context .
well , i &apos;m sorry . please .
supply the context .
it ...
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t wait for the first shooting
with a 3 @-@ d gun ,
&quot; &apos; cause then we &apos;ll see how the government tries
to suppress the printing press . &quot;
it was an intellectual argument .
yeah , except you said , &quot; school shooting . &quot;
yes . i wa ... i was ... i was just being provocative .
i @-@ i was , i was trying to draw attention to the issues .
i would phrase it differently now , your honor .
good to know .
$ 200,000 .
oh , come on , nancy .
let me take it to my client .
if he &apos;s the good cop , but she &apos;s the bad one ,
what does that make you two ?
give us time to talk to our client .
come on . be honest . the only reason that you &apos;re not
going after the shooter is because he &apos;s broke .
and it wasn &apos;t his fault .
we &apos;ll present the offer
and get back to you .
okay .
okay .
well , i &apos;m advising eddie to take it .
that would be a mistake . crozier is on the run .
she has a jackass for a client
and abernathy on the bench .
yes , and $ 200,000 is double what my client expected .
our client .
the client that i brought to you .
for our judgment .
yeah , for your judgment , yeah ,
but not for you politics .
what does that mean ?
this case is about a young father
confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life .
it &apos;s not about gun control .
it &apos;s also not about the quick fees you can make from $ 200,000 .
still got some hard feelings there , cary ?
you mean from you trying to put me in jail for 15 years ?
no , no . that &apos;s ancient history .
okay , okay , let &apos;s just take a breath .
let &apos;s ask the client what he wants .
when did the 2 : 30 tomorrow get moved
to the black business leaders lunch ?
she was supposed to be doing the rotary , but wha ... ?
why did they get moved ?
i don &apos;t know .
when did it get moved ?
an hour ago ?
what happened an hour ago ?
i don &apos;t know .
why the black business leaders ?
prady &apos;s doing a speech there , too , so ...
it &apos;s about peter .
it &apos;s about prady criticizing peter .
i &apos;m thinking of getting a tramp stamp .
what do you think ?
she &apos;s not defending him , is she ?
she &apos;s throwing peter under the bus .
it &apos;s about his black hiring practices .
i have to go , dad . take care .
marissa , get back in here !
rebecca smercornish . i &apos;m a ballistics
and modern trajectory expert with the saa .
so , you &apos;re sure you want to keep going ?
... i had a joint justice department atf working group
looking into regulating 3d firearms .
did you happen to study under mr. mcveigh ,
the plaintiff &apos;s ballistics expert ?
i did .
and do you have an opinion
about the testimony that he &apos;s given this afternoon ?
i do .
mr. mcveigh is an excellent ballistics expert ,
but i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s a bit ...
old school .
he specializes in trajectory analysis
and gunshot residue on any weapon
produced in the last 100 years .
but not wiki weapons .
and when you examined the gun at issue in this case ,
did you notice anything unusual ?
i did .
uh ... may i ?
i must admit , i worry about turning this trial into a clinic
on gun @-@ making , but ... yeah , please .
the cad specs provided by mr. fife
are for his preferred version of the firearm .
but given that the file is open source ,
it &apos;s easy for a user to tweak the design
to his or her taste .
can you give us an example ?
sure .
imagine you have small hands , like i do .
you just make an adjustment to the program ,
and voil- custom grip .
and you can do that to any part of the gun , easily .
did mr. pope make any adjustments ?
yes , he shortened the barrel .
not a lot .
by less than a 16th of an inch , to 3.43 .
i &apos;m certain that &apos;s why mr. mcveigh didn &apos;t catch it .
and could such a tweak
have contributed to the gun misfiring ?
yes .
but could the designer of the gun-- mr. fife--
have done anything about this ?
could he have prevented mr. pope from making such a tweak ?
no .
the gun mr. pope brought to the firing range
was the one he made , with his own tweaks ,
for which he is responsible .
mr. pope is really the person who should be sued here .
but you can also change the way a printer prints , is that right ?
yeah , it is .
the quality of plastic you use makes a big difference , too .
as does your infill setting ...
right .
we &apos;re finding , on the new ... - hello .
may i have our mr. mcveigh for a moment ?
yes .
definitely .
congratulations , by the way .
i heard you tied the knot .
we did . thanks .
this is not an intellectual exercise .
we &apos;re here to win , dear .
actually , you &apos;re here to win .
i &apos;m here to testify .
for us .
if they know you have doubts ,
they &apos;ll put you back on the stand to exploit them .
where are you going ?
to assuage my doubts .
so , the black business leaders .
it &apos;s a good venue .
it &apos;s a very good venue to trash peter .
do i need to be here for this ?
yes . you &apos;re supposed to be the adult here .
when he goes off on one of his crusades , you steer .
i am steering .
it &apos;s the smart move , and if you were here ,
instead of off doing , uh , uh ...
peter is finally making traction with black voters
and you &apos;re gonna screw it up .
that &apos;s not our problem .
yes , it is your problem .
you need peter .
you need the governor .
there are three days left in the campaign , eli .
we needed the governor .
we don &apos;t now .
we &apos;re up by three .
you may not want peter as a friend ,
but you certainly don &apos;t want him as an enemy .
oh @-@ oh , what &apos;s that mean ?
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
the governor &apos;s not going to come out against his own wife .
josh , why don &apos;t you give us a minute ?
sure .
always a pleasure , eli .
i got you that job in california .
you did not get me the job in california .
you made a phone call .
and i can withdraw that call .
it &apos;s the kind of job that could make someone &apos;s reputation .
so you &apos;re gonna bad @-@ mouth me
unless i pull back on the black business leaders ?
oh , yes .
it &apos;s your choice , jon .
you want that job ,
you tell alicia it &apos;s a bad idea to trash peter ,
because it is a bad idea to trash peter .
you don &apos;t need it , this late in the campaign .
you know you don &apos;t .
this is an exact replica of the 3 @-@ d gun that carsten pope fired .
including the tweak .
so this gun should match the gun that injured my client ?
yes . it was also printed on pope &apos;s printer .
you want to do the honors ?
mm .
just enough to pull the trigger .
ready ?
kurt , is that good ?
maybe . i believe that we &apos;re getting catastrophic failure
from these guns because the 3 @-@ d printer was false feeding .
false feeding ?
yeah . i noticed that the printer was stuttering sometimes ,
when it was pulling the plastic filament off the spool .
now , it resulted in some layers being skipped ,
making the barrel too weak in some places
to contain the explosion when a bullet &apos;s fired .
but ... is that the designer &apos;s fault ?
no .
i &apos;ll need to get a different printer
and test fife &apos;s design with and without the tweak .
but it &apos;ll take some time .
uh , but as of now ?
my expert opinion is ... the printer &apos;s to blame .
so you think i have the wrong defendant ?
yes .
my husband was a good state &apos;s attorney .
but he made some mistakes .
some were front page news .
others weren &apos;t .
there &apos;s this saying ...
there &apos;s this saying ...
you &apos;re early . i thought we said 1 : 00 .
we did .
but i was thinking about the black business leaders speech .
oh , yes . i was just working on it now .
well , i ... i &apos;m having second thoughts .
i think it &apos;s a mistake to throw peter under the bus .
you do ?
i do . i &apos;m worried about you losing more votes
than you &apos;d gain ... old @-@ time supporters of his , christians .
we &apos;ve hitched our wagon to peter from the beginning .
i &apos;m worried that we might end up looking like opportunists .
but what about countering prady &apos;s attack ?
i looked at the overnights--
the attack doesn &apos;t seem to leave much of a mark .
i &apos;m thinking we play to our base .
you sure ?
yes .
for better or for worse , you guys are a brand .
you &apos;re the florricks . a package deal .
this is the first speech .
it &apos;ll be on the teleprompters .
okay .
okay . i &apos;ll see you at 1 : 00 .
why are you leaving election day ?
this job in sacramento . it &apos;s a special election .
they ... they &apos;re in trouble .
so it &apos;s not because of me . of us .
no .
okay .
okay .
what &apos;s this ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s too far away .
what is it ?
you amended the suit .
oh , yes , we did . based on your test .
we &apos;re suing the maker of the printer .
but you &apos;re still suing chris fife ,
even though his design isn &apos;t the problem .
fife &apos;s web site links to the faulty printer .
he specifically advocates its use ,
so we &apos;re able to backdoor him .
you don &apos;t believe that he is legally negligent .
you just think he &apos;s politically offensive .
i think he &apos;s both .
he &apos;s making it possible for anyone to make
an untraceable , untrackable gun .
who do you think will use it ?
that &apos;s not a question for lawyers .
that &apos;s for politicians . you want to run ? run .
we need you to testify , kurt .
i need you to testify .
no .
not for a crusade .
you can talk to him .
oh , that &apos;s all right .
it helps .
squeeze his hand and talk to him .
so ...
i &apos;m here because i need to know
what you want me to do with your money , mr. canning .
this family , they want to give it to a palestinian charity ,
but it might have illegal ties ...
she probably means talk about something personal .
my daughter &apos;s praying for you , so that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m not . because that would be hypocritical .
i don &apos;t want you to die , mr. canning , okay ?
i know you &apos;re a bad man , but ...
i sort of miss you .
i know . that &apos;s weird .
i don &apos;t know why .
i seem to have some ...
bad boy issues .
get well , mr. canning .
okay .
i am gonna get your money to that charity .
bye .
you &apos;re a real dirtbag ,
you know that ?
no , i didn &apos;t know that .
you &apos;re letting my dad bully you .
marissa , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
he threatened to yank your next job
unless you advised alicia to back down .
alicia and peter are better off standing together .
they &apos;re a package deal .
package deal .
yeah , i heard my dad say it already , dirtbag .
well , then marissa , why don &apos;t you leave me alone , okay ?
your job is to give her chapstick and breath mints ,
not bust my balls .
god , handsome men are so weak .
kurt mcveigh ?
yeah ?
you &apos;ve been served .
who &apos;s it from ?
diane lockhart .
so you used the same blockstock 3 @-@ d printer to make your gun
as carsten pope did ?
yes .
and would you characterize it
as a smooth process ?
i have nothing to compare it to .
i think your , uh ,
witness would appreciate some specificity .
let me rephrase .
did you find that when you were making the gun ...
the printer stuttered ?
yes .
were you able to determine why ?
there was too much friction in the feed tube .
and what effect did this have on the resulting print ?
it prevented the layers of plastic from being applied evenly .
so when you test @-@ fired the gun , what happened ?
it misfired .
so would you say
that the fault for this lies
with blockstock , the designer of the 3 @-@ d printer ?
yes .
your honor , no offense to my codefendants ,
but i fail to see how mr. mcveigh &apos;s
testimony is relevant to my client .
uh , ms. lockhart , would you care to enlighten us ?
mr. fife &apos;s web site links to the
blockstock 3 @-@ d printer site .
your honor , that connection is ridiculously tenuous .
it &apos;s joint and several liability , your honor .
mr. fife and blockstock were both negligent here .
therefore we can and should be able to recover damages
from both .
makes sense to me .
mr. fife should make himself comfortable .
so don &apos;t you want diane here and not me ?
no .
this is the feed tube from carsten pope &apos;s printer .
look through it .
sure .
i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s clogged .
after carsten pope printed his gun ,
he made several coffee mugs .
okay , well , that &apos;s oddly innocuous .
you think that &apos;s what caused the misfire , mixing the plastics ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s why we test .
well , it &apos;s intact .
so ... that &apos;s bad ?
maybe .
well , the printer worked fine ,
which means that the company &apos;s not at fault .
yeah , it also means that the gun pope fired
wasn &apos;t based on a bad design either .
right . good . except , you know ... we have no idea
why the gun failed .
yeah .
but the first order of business is dropping blockstock
from the suit . they did nothing wrong .
bbl has always been about ...
do you want anything for your hair ?
no . i &apos;m good . thank you .
okay .
you think our campaign managers know we &apos;re alone in here ?
i think our campaign managers think we &apos;re running off together .
we could do worse .
go ahead . i don &apos;t mind .
no .
i &apos;m sick of phones . it &apos;s always bad news .
not for you these days .
not that i &apos;m following the polls .
oh , i think it &apos;s too close to call .
oh , i don &apos;t think it is .
whenever i think i &apos;m certain about something ,
i &apos;m always surprised .
it &apos;s a bad process , isn &apos;t it ?
horrible .
anything you &apos;d do differently ?
i &apos;d be more honest .
how &apos; bout you ?
the debate .
oh , right .
and the closeted charge . i would answer it .
you still can .
no one thinks it &apos;s wrong to be gay .
can i tell you a secret ?
who else but your opponent ?
i &apos;m not gay . i &apos;m a jesuit .
i never remarried
because you only get married once .
to remarry is to commit adultery .
it &apos;s the god &apos;s honest truth .
wh ... why didn &apos;t you say that ?
well , we didn &apos;t want to lose the gay vote
and @-@ and ... besides , it makes you look weird .
what person in this day and age takes jesus christ seriously
when he says , &quot; you can &apos;t divorce &quot; ?
not someone you want to get a beer with .
you are ...
better than i am .
no .
oh , yeah .
unfortunately .
it &apos;s been good fighting you .
good luck on your speech .
think i should put something in my hair ?
no .
you &apos;re perfect .
hello , eli , how are you ?
well , that depends . are you sending money to the palestinians ?
i hate these silences , alicia .
where are you hearing this , eli ?
i just got a call from a friend in the justice department .
he asked me to check if you &apos;re funding some ...
pro @-@ palestinian charity based in detroit .
it &apos;s dearborn .
and no , i &apos;m not .
alicia , what the hell ?
you &apos;re sending money to hamas ?
no , it &apos;s not me ,
it &apos;s louis canning . he &apos;s sick ,
and he wanted to do something nice ...
what , send money to hamas ?
for the donor of his kidney .
they wanted to give money to this charity , and ...
there &apos;s a possibility that this charity ...
might be connected to hamas .
so i was checking on it for him , that &apos;s all .
why were you checking ?
because he asked me to and david lee wouldn &apos;t .
so i did .
oh , alicia , you &apos;re being set up .
what ? what are you ...
this canning guy is suing you , right ?
and david lee is no friend , and they both found a way
for you to check on giving money to hamas .
he &apos;s on his deathbed , eli .
canning &apos;s not gonna prank me on his deathbed .
why not ?
because ...
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m giving up .
good @-@ bye .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . what do you mean ?
you look like something &apos;s wrong .
no , but there &apos;s been a change . you look great .
thanks . what changed ?
go after peter .
go after him ?
yes , for racial disparities when he was sa .
i gave the new speech to the teleprompter .
what changed ?
nothing . i was wrong . this is the smart thing to do .
oh , that &apos;s prady . he &apos;s doing well .
yeah . you &apos;re next .
go after peter . kill him .
no mercy .
okay .
welcome to the freedom factory .
just @-@ just signed the lease and got a copy of the keys right here .
we finally have all this , this elbow room .
and @-@ and the ... the heater works .
i , i think about all the time and money ,
uh , we wasted trying to print in my parents &apos; garage .
yeah , we &apos;re not gonna miss that damn icebox .
mcveigh .
i &apos;m sorry ... what ?
have you tried printing the gun in a cold @-@ temperature environment ?
have i ... ?
who is this ?
kalinda .
see , low or fluctuating temperatures can impede
the layers of plastic from adhering correctly .
every politician struggles with the 11th commandment .
speak no ill
of your fellow party member .
because sometimes you just disagree .
but when that disagreement is with someone
who is not just a fellow traveler , but ...
in my case , a spouse ,
it gets even more complicated .
because the most insidious form of racism
is unconscious and exists in our legal system .
my husband was a good state &apos;s attorney .
but he made some mistakes .
eli ?
consider yourself out of a job ,
you son of a bitch .
well , you do what you have to do , eli .
i &apos;m running a campaign .
it &apos;s already done .
enjoy the speech .
there &apos;s the saying &quot; racism without racist . &quot;
i think this perfectly describes cook county
and the sa &apos;s office .
i think about all the time and money ,
uh , we wasted trying to print in my parents &apos; garage .
we &apos;re not gonna miss that damn icebox .
you knew that printing in cold temperatures warps the plastic
and weakens the structure of the gun , didn &apos;t you ?
this ... is a new field with a lot of variables ...
a simple yes or no , please .
yes .
and did you offer any warning
as to the effect of cold temperatures on the printing process ?
no , no , but buyer needs to beware .
five million .
excuse me ?
you have to drop the suit
and sign this nondisclosure agreement .
fife doesn &apos;t have that kind of insurance .
where is the money coming from ?
an interested party has been following the case .
the nra ?
no , private individuals who understand
the importance of this evolving issue ,
and would be willing to underwrite fife &apos;s defense .
we have a right to know .
no , actually , you don &apos;t .
but you have the right to take it , mr. summerfeldt ,
and drop this suit . or you don &apos;t ...
and then my mysterious benefactor
uses his bounty of treasure to destroy you .
so , what do you say , mr. summerfeldt ?
alicia ?
how are you today ?
good .
looks like you might be , too .
yeah .
getting stronger .
good .
so , are you setting me up ?
am i , am i , am i setting you up ?
the 18 million you wanted donated--
is that a scheme with david lee ?
i really have ...
no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you wanted your stocks liquidated
and given to a palestinian charity ?
i @-@ i what ... ?
the donor &apos;s family .
you wanted 18 million given to them .
you wanted to do good .
no , i didn &apos;t ! what do you mean , what do you mean i want to do good ?
you don &apos;t remember the conversation we had yesterday ?
you gave me power of attorney .
alicia , what the hell ? ! where &apos;s my money ? !
well , there were some complications .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
anesthesia plus tremor meds .
i was in a , in a , in a , in a fugue state !
i can &apos;t ... where , where , where &apos;s my money ? !
right where it belongs . with david lee .
oh , thank god !
okay .
i &apos;m going now .
this was ... great .
always fun talking to you .
alicia , wait !
can you , can you hand me my phone ?
you mean ... this phone here ?
yeah , you know , don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t kid around .
just hand me the phone .
no .
i think it looks good
right ...
there .
alicia ...
good seeing you , mr. canning .
oh , now it &apos;s ringing !
can you get ... ? what ... ?
nurse !
just came to see how you were doing .
i &apos;ll be fine .
but i think i owe you an apology .
i let my political passions drive a wedge between us .
and that &apos;s never been how we do things .
true .
oh , he of few words .
i think we need to go away together .
good .
what do you think about a week in italy this may ?
the amalfi coast .
actually , i was , uh , thinking more like tomorrow .
i can &apos;t get away for a week .
yeah , i know .
three days of deer hunting in wyoming
with the richest men in the country .
sure , let &apos;s go .
hi . i thought you were out .
i was out .
just getting back .
uh , listen , i didn &apos;t get to congratulate you .
the speech went very well .
it did . thanks .
so , another 48 hours .
yeah , yeah . there &apos;s a story out that you &apos;re supporting hamas ?
i don &apos;t need to worry about that , do i ?
no .
good .
um ... listen , i &apos;m not very ...
not very good at expressing my feelings , uh ...
so i don &apos;t really like to ...
do you want to come inside ?
no , no , no . i just ... i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . you know what ? oh , whatever .
