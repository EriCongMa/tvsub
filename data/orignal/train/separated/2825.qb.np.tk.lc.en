god , if you &apos;re going to cry about it !
the one with ballroom dancing
treeger made you cry ?
he said really mean things that were only partly true .
i &apos;ll teach him a lesson .
joey , don &apos;t . let &apos;s forget about it .
that &apos;s easy for you to say . you weren &apos;t almost just killed !
all right , that &apos;s it . school is in session !
is this a gym card ?
oh , yeah , gym member .
i try to go four times a week , but i &apos;ve missed ...
... the last 1200 times .
so why don &apos;t you quit ?
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ve tried ?
you think i like having $ 50 a month taken from my account ?

they use all these phrases and peppiness to confuse you .
and then they bring out maria .
who is maria ?
oh , maria !
you can &apos;t say no to her .
she &apos;s like this lycra , spandex @-@ covered , gym treat .
do you need me to go with you and hold your hand ?
you &apos;re strong enough to face her ?
oh , no . you &apos;ll have to come .
tribbiani . hold on .
i &apos;ll get the plunger .
you hold on . you made my friend rachel cry .
so you &apos;ll go and apologize to her ... unless you want me to call the landlord .
and tell him what ?
maybe you haven &apos;t heard of &quot; not making girls cry . &quot;
maybe you haven &apos;t heard of the rent stabilization act of 1968 .
i have actually not heard of that .
your friends are violating it .
i &apos;ve been nice until now , but i don &apos;t need this grief .
i &apos;m telling the landlord ...
... monica &apos;s illegally subletting her grandmother &apos;s place .
your friends are out of here , pal .
why don &apos;t you tell me something i don &apos;t know ?
somebody tell me i don &apos;t have to work today .
what &apos;s the matter ?
my first massage is this incredibly gorgeous guy .
every time i see him , i want to ...
... do things to him i can &apos;t charge for .
so do them for free .
no , it is forbidden .
mrs. potter fires people for messing around with clients .
and it &apos;s against my oath as a masseuse .
they make you take an oath ?
no , i made myself take one .
no fooling around with clients ...
... and always be prepared .
that one &apos;s from the boy scouts , but it just makes good sense .
why not give him to someone else ?
no , i can handle it . i &apos;m a professional .
pheebs , is that a new ankle bracelet ?
you got a pedicure.your feet are all dressed up .
that &apos;s the only part he can see when he &apos;s on the table !
you &apos;re going to do some feet flirting !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
how do you explain the toe ring ?
it &apos;s arabian princess day at work . leave me alone !
my hero ! what happened ?
i told him no one treats my friends like that .
and he better apologize . see you !
wait a minute .
what did he say ?
he wouldn &apos;t apologize because you &apos;re living here illegally .
instead , he &apos;ll evict you . see you later !
you got us evicted ?
i told you not to go down there .
he made rachel cry !
rachel always cries !
that &apos;s not true !
you go down there , and you suck up to him .
you suck like you &apos;ve never sucked before !
all right , i &apos;ll try .
if i can &apos;t , you stay with us till you get settled .
go !
all right , all right .
i &apos;ll have to check first , but he &apos;ll be cool .
remember what we talked about . you got to be strong .
now one more time .

you have really pretty feet .
these old things ?
would you spend time on my sciatic area ? it &apos;s killing me .
you mean .... by sciatic , you mean ...
... the towel @-@ covered portion ?
sure , i can do that .
because the muscles in the sciatic area can get ...
... real nice and tight .
so tell me , rick , how did you injure the area ?
a 16 @-@ hour sit @-@ in for greenpeace .
did you just bite me ?
no !
what ?
please don &apos;t kick the girls out . this was my fault .
you want me to kick you guys out instead ?
you can &apos;t . where would the chick and the duck live ?
you have pets ? -no
those are nicknames .
i &apos;m the &quot; chick , &quot; and chandler &apos;s the &quot; duck . &quot;
i would &apos;ve thought it was the other way around .

i &apos;ll do whatever you want .

yeah , absolutely .
i got something .
what is it ?
can you be my dancing partner ?

i want to quit the gym .
can you honestly tell me that you &apos;re 100 % satisfied with your body .
yes , yes . most of the time .
i mean , sure , i have my bad days , but then i remember what a cute smile i have .
we were voted &quot; best @-@ equipped gym in new york &quot; two years running .
do you really want to give that up ?
yes , i hate it here .
everything that you have in here is very heavy .
really ? okay ?
you want to make your friend work out alone ?
what friend ?
your friend ross . just joined .
his dancing partner ?
there &apos;s this superintendents &apos; dance , &quot; the super ball . &quot;
he wants to impress marge , this lady super he likes .
why not practice with a girl ?
he &apos;s too shy .
he &apos;s not good enough to dance with girls yet .
yeah , right .
he almost danced me right down that garbage chute .
would you let it go already ? you &apos;re fine .
so did you quit ?
i almost did .
couldn &apos;t leave ross there without a spotter .
wait , now , so you joined the gym ?
and that &apos;s funny , why ?
i was just , you know , picturing you working out , and ....
well , that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re doomed .
they &apos;ll take $ 50 a month from our accounts for the rest of our lives .
what are we gonna do ?
you could actually go to the gym .
or we could go to the bank ...
... close our accounts and cut them off at the source .
you &apos;re a genius .
oh , man ! but then , we won &apos;t be bank buddies .
now there &apos;s two reasons .
you guys , remember that cute client i told you about ?
i bit him .
where ?
on the tushy .
and that &apos;s not against your oath ?
i know , but the moment i touch him ...
... i want to throw out my old oath and take a new , dirty one .
next time , try to distract yourself .
like when i &apos;m doing something exciting ...
... and i don &apos;t want to get too ... excited .
i try and think of other things . like sandwiches ...
... and baseball ...
... and chandler .
thank you .
oh , no , thank you .
all right , i &apos;m here . let &apos;s get this over with .
okay , well ... just follow my lead .
don &apos;t we need to do some kind of preparation first ?
like get really drunk ?
come on . hey , just put your arms around me .
i &apos;m sorry .
no . it &apos;s okay . but if i &apos;m marge ...
... my breasts are coming out my back .
forget it ! i &apos;m not being any good at this .
my mom was right .
i &apos;m just a big potato with arms and legs and a head .
come on , man . you &apos;re not a potato .
i &apos;m sure as hell not a dancer . it &apos;s no use .
marge will never go for me .
come on , treeger . don &apos;t say that .
you just need more practice .
come on . let &apos;s try it again .
come on
plus , it was probably mostly my fault anyway .
i &apos;m not that comfortable dancing with a

okey .
i have an enormous crush on you .
but since you &apos;re a client , i can &apos;t ask you out ... even though you give me the feelings .
i had no idea .
i can always find another masseuse .
really ? yeah , really .
what ?
suddenly i &apos;m very aware i &apos;m naked .
quiet down .
mr. simon &apos;s been waiting oh , my god !
why wasn &apos;t i offered that ?
i &apos;d definitely pay more for that .
we have rules here . this is not that kind of place .
i know , but this isn &apos;t how it looks at all ...
... because rick is my husband .
oh , really ?
you &apos;d better tell his other wife.she called three times asking where he is .
yes , i will tell her .
so you didn &apos;t leave the bank ?
and somehow we ended up with a joint checking account .
what will you ever use that for ?
to pay for the gym .
so i had a great day .
rick and i hit it off . we were making out .
then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore .
you got fired ?
oh , my gosh !
it &apos;s so weird . i have never been fired from anything .
sweetie .
i started walking around , not knowing what to do next .
i started asking people on the street if they wanted massages .
then these policemen thought i was a whore too .
it &apos;s really been a bad day , whore @-@ wise .
hey , duck . is chick here ?
yeah , bunny rabbit .
ready for our last practice ?
we &apos;re not getting that spin right because my place is too small .
want to use our place ?
no , i had another idea .
we did it !
that was incredible !
that was amazing ! we totally nailed it !
hey , listen . thanks a lot , tribbiani .
oh , my god ! look at the time .
i got to catch the bus to the ball .
good luck .
unless you want to practice the fox trot . or the tango ?
thanks , but no .
you see , i think i &apos;m ready to dance with girls .
go get them , treeger .
right .
you want to come ? marge has a friend .
really ?
you &apos;d dance good with her . she &apos;s the same size as me .
no , i &apos;m good .
it looks like you &apos;ve got great experience .
let &apos;s see . reason for leaving last job ?
they thought i was a whore .
okay . we &apos;ll give you a call if anything comes up .
