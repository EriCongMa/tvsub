stop !
careful .
okay .
this is truly magnificent .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
i do -- yuck .
cavanaugh &apos;s gonna kill you
for dragging this hunk of junk in here .
this is a gia dupont original .
i should &apos;ve brought you to more museums .
then maybe you &apos;d appreciate art .
what , so a decomposing pinto is art ?
least you bought american .
you know , i bet you could &apos;ve gotten
a ted williams original for what you spent .
i don &apos;t know that artist .
he drove a home run 502 feet into
the bleachers at fenway .
you put that ball on display ,
you &apos;d have grown men weeping .
ohh ! it &apos;s too bad we have a case .
i could stare at this for hours .
me too .
don &apos;t touch .
i hate taggers .
that &apos;s not tagging . it &apos;s graffiti .
same thing .
no , it is not .
wow . what a powerful piece of street art .
what a powerful example of felony vandalism .
jane , this is contemporary art .
says the woman who paid $ 50,000
for old pinto parts .
banksy &apos;s street art starts at $ 100,000 .
you don &apos;t know who that is .
yes , i do . he &apos;s an urban artist .
and i wouldn &apos;t pay for his old pinto parts , either .
frankie ?
yeah ?
come take photos of all this vandalism
for the graffiti task force , all right ?
you got it .
he a witness ?
says he was working late in his gallery , heard some yelling .
i just thought it was a couple of homeless vets ,
you know , squabbling over a shopping cart .
why were you working late ?
i &apos;m preparing for a big showing of my art .
oh . detective rizzoli would want to attend that .
she &apos;s a budding art enthusiast .
for real ?
for not real .
wh-- go help korsak .
we just saw this in a different medium .
you &apos;ve seen my work ?
so , you &apos;re admitting to felony vandalism ?
no . i did not put those ... posters up .
we catch you defacing property ,
you won &apos;t have another art show , okay , pal ?
survived fallujah to die in the streets of boston .
victim is bernard avery , 29 .
he &apos;s still warm . rigor hasn &apos;t presented .
some nasty wounds .
vultures go through his stuff already ?
sad .
we &apos;ve got about 300 homeless vets on the streets of boston .
sharp @-@ force trauma --
chop wounds , puncture wounds .
well , hey , look at you . bold .
you ready to call the weapons ?
you thinking two weapons ?
maybe two killers .
no , there &apos;s only one set of shoe impressions .
right .
those couldn &apos;t possibly be bloody footprints .
rondo !
yo ! vanilla ! over here !
come on , man ! let me go .
rondo ! come back here !
i got a tip on your murder ,
but your 5 @-@ 0 bro trying to act like we ain &apos;t even family here !
what &apos;s up ?
this better be good , rondo .
you are gonna want to promote me to homicide , vanilla .
one of my c.i.s knows who the killer is .
wh-- how many you got ?
as many as you need , baby .
yo , justin .
general rondo .
perimeter &apos;s clear , my man .
&quot; general &quot; ?
you sure she &apos;s not taliban , sir ?
you can trust her . she works for me .
don &apos;t you , private ?
wh--
work with me , vanilla .
yes .
general rondo here
tells me that you can i.d. the killer ?
lance corporal justin brown , ma &apos;am .
yes , i can .
sergeant avery was k.i.a. &apos; d
by an insurgent dressed in force recon .
take this .
it contains classified intel .
really ?
i &apos;m telling you -- he saw something .
the kid was a marine special ops .
i got you , my man .
your intel is safe with me .
man , homicide &apos;s hard @-@ up .
economy &apos;s getting to you , too , huh , vanilla ?
you know what ?
when you bring me a real witness ,
i &apos;ll bring you some real money .
centimeter and a half deep .
help me turn him over .
so , let &apos;s see .
stab wounds , bruises , gashes --
that could be three different weapons .
not necessarily .
the bruises here were likely caused by a rounded instrument .
yeah , that could be from the handle of a hammer .
the stab wounds could be from the claw ,
but it doesn &apos;t explain these massive gashes .
the gashes are consistent with a cleaver .
or an ... ax .
maura ...
what if the murder weapon had an ax on one side
and , like , a narrow spike on the other ?
what does that look like ? does that look like a tomahawk to you ?
well , there hasn &apos;t been a murder in boston by tomahawk
since the pequot tribe attacked the colonists .
yeah , but our victim is a vet . he &apos;s a marine .
they issue tactical tomahawks to marines .
would that explain these injuries ?
got a fresh one for you , dr. isles .
guy collapsed in a cab on his way to logan .
emts pronounced him .
put him on this table . thank you .
dennis rockmond , 37 .
ooh . kind of hot -- for a dead guy .
maura .
maura !
what ?
his penis has a pulse .
oh , my go-- he &apos;s alive !
he has obstruction in his airway ,
it might be a bronchospasm . where are the emts ? !
how far away are you ?
five minutes . maura , do something .
look , someone needs to perform a cricothyrotomy .
oh . what about you ?
you &apos;re here . you could do it .
find me a slender tube .
where ?
in the drawer .
you have a lot of drawers .
any tube that can create an airway -- a @-@ a straw .
straw . you want a milkshake ?
i need a tube !
okay ! okay ! um , okay .
pen . i got it ! i got a pen !
oh , god . i hate working on live people .
what if i kill him again ?
maura , just do it .
okay .
oh , come on . come on .
maura , look . i think you did it .
you &apos;re okay . you &apos;re alive .
2 milligrams salbutamol . he &apos;s having bronchospasms .
well , that was exciting .
you think we should bump fists ?
it is nice to save someone that handsome .
wha-- really ?
so if he was ugly , you would have let him die ?
of course not .
listen , get to work on this other dead guy , okay ?
oh , maura , check his pulse first .
well , i think our murder weapon may be a tactical tomahawk .
we had them in &apos; nam .
to cut through the jungle ?
pshh . to cut through people .
maybe our victim had a tomahawk .
the military started reissuing them in 2004 .
well , let &apos;s check his records .
hey , i heard you and dr . isles brought a zombie back to life .
how &apos;d you know ?
news like that travels .
yeah -- hard and fast .
does the fascination with your ding @-@ a @-@ lings ever end ?
nope .
nope .
i hope we &apos;re not looking at a vet @-@ on @-@ vet murder .
here &apos;s bernard &apos;s military record .
it &apos;s clean . right there --
three combat tours , honorably discharged .
any arrests since he &apos;s been back ?
trespassing , couple of street fights ,
public drinking , and disorderly .
no convictions , though .
we got any pictures of his marine squad ?
yeah .
there he is -- holding his tomahawk .
if he brought it back ,
it wasn &apos;t in his shopping cart .
zoom in on the guy on his right .
that looks like rondo &apos;s c.i. justin .
lance corporal justin brown .
got his tomahawk strapped on .
yeah , we got our first suspect . print that .
bernard avery &apos;s widow &apos;s here to see you guys .
korsak , come on .
come on , frankie . come help me pick up a murder suspect .
do you recognize any of the other men
in your husband &apos;s squad ?
that &apos;s justin ...
his best friend .
a lot of his squad was from home .
makes it harder if you have to ...
see them die .
is that what happened on the third tour ?
they were on patrol .
they only had a week left .
there was a suicide bomber who blew himself up .
a lot of them died .
i &apos;m sorry .
when bernard came home , he barely spoke ,
except to justin .
he tried to get a job ,
but he was diagnosed with ptsd .
was he treated for it ?
a friend from my wives support group
told me about this outreach center .
did it help ?
it seemed like it .
but he was kicked out after a couple weeks .
did your husband come back with any weapons ?
a tomahawk .
is that what killed him ?
maybe .
i begged him to get rid of it .
it scared me , it scared our son .
but he said he didn &apos;t feel safe without it .
when did your husband become homeless ?
about six months ago , after one of his nightmares .
he thought that there was a suicide bomber in the house .
he was looking for his sniper rifle .
he said he had to kill him .
kill who ?
ki--
kill our son .
i knew i could lose him over there .
i never thought i &apos;d lose him when he finally came home .
i didn &apos;t know you lost friends in vietnam .
i don &apos;t like to talk about it . people don &apos;t like to hear it .
what happened when you approached the checkpoint ?
an i.e.d. went off -- right in front of the humvee .
my sergeant &apos;s hit .
virtual @-@ reality therapy .
we &apos;re taking fire .
it feels too real .
but it isn &apos;t , marlon .
what you &apos;re seeing is a virtual simulation ,
and this is rob &apos;s experience in iraq .
it &apos;s not yours . yours will be different .
dude , it &apos;s bad at first , but it gets a lot easier .
i don &apos;t know .
look , confronting your fears --
rob , why don &apos;t you take marlon and go grab a cup of coffee ?
i &apos;m dr. bacal .
how can i help you ?
uh , boston homicide .
we &apos;d like to ask you
some questions about bernard avery .
please don &apos;t tell me
bernard &apos;s been involved in a homicide .
actually , he is the homicide .
we found him hacked to death in an alley this morning .
what can you tell us about him ?
um , not much .
i , uh , i tried to work with him ,
but he was suspicious about psychologists .
i had one of our vets ,
a lieutenant colonel , work with him , as well .
uh , can we speak with him , please ?
sure .
come in .
colonel , i have two detectives here
to talk about bernard avery .
sure .
colonel jones ! how are you , sir ?
no complaints .
except i &apos;ve got a sprained ankle . you mind if i sit ?
no , please .
hello , jane .
hello , colonel .
uh , we &apos;re here , uh ...
investigating the murder of bernard avery .
well , damn .
what happened ?
why was he kicked out of this program ?
we had no choice .
we , uh , we had a new patient
a marine from bernard &apos;s unit .
they got into a physical fight over something that happened in fallujah .
i had to ask them both to leave .
was his name justin brown ?
no .
his name is tyler moore
lives at the vet center .
thank you , colonel . appreciate the help .
anytime .
um , can you ... can you give me a minute ?
sure . i &apos;ll pull the car around .
what the hell , casey ?
jane-
how long have you been back ?
a few months .
and -- and you did--
you couldn &apos;t --
i &apos;ve been really busy with the veterans center and the ...
oh . no .
&apos;cause the last time that we talked ...
i told you i was on a covert assignment ,
wasn &apos;t allowed to tell you where i was sent .
operation south boston ?
it &apos;s a little complicated .
try me .
things have changed , jane .
but it &apos;s good to see you .
can you close the door on your way out ?
yes , it &apos;s good to see you , too .
the cute boy with the erection
is being discharged from the hospital .
he sent me these orchids .
good . i wish him and his wang a speedy recovery .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i saw casey .
what ? where ? when ?
h @-@ he &apos;s back ... in boston .
actually -- actually , he &apos;s been here for a while .
jane , i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , my god .
did you like him more than dean ?
you did , didn &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ve been waiting for him to get back from afghanistan , and ...
and he did .
what did he say ?
&quot; good to see you . &quot;
uh @-@ oh . that &apos;s bad .
maura .
you want a real &quot; ow &quot; ?
wait till your zombie says , &quot; oh , i &apos;m really busy . &quot;
maybe that &apos;s him .
it &apos;s korsak .
he has our suspect in interroga--
i can &apos;t focus .
go interrogate .
studies show that the best antidote for heartbreak
is distraction .
okay .
the only reason that i &apos;m going is because if i don &apos;t ,
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna spend the rest of my life
curled up in the fetal position on your couch .
and your couch blows .
hello , tyler .
private first class tyler moore , united states marine corps .
semper fi .
i didn &apos;t kill bernard .
tyler , you &apos;re not a suspect ,
but we would like to know why there was bad blood between you .
it &apos;s &apos; cause of what he did .
or didn &apos;t do .
what didn &apos;t he do ?
we were on patrol .
bernard was covering our advance .
he saw the suicide bomber coming right toward us .
he didn &apos;t take the shot .
is that what put you in that chair ?
yeah .
killed six guys .
and bernard came home without a scratch .
and if i wasn &apos;t in this chair , i would &apos;ve killed him .
what about justin brown ?
does he feel the same way ?
justin &apos;s brains were scrambled .
they were buddies .
i hope they both go to hell .
it won &apos;t make the pain go away , tyler .
excuse me .
what &apos;s up , frost ?
we found justin .
is he still saying that bernard was murdered by insurgents ?
he &apos;s not saying anything , jane .
he &apos;s dead .
justin &apos;s injuries are similar to bernard &apos;s .
so they were both killed with a tactical tomahawk .
you &apos;re fixated on casey .
why don &apos;t you just talk to him ?
i would rather juggle your scalpels .
don &apos;t you want to know ?
oh , i know -- it &apos;s over .
the university of missouri researchers do say
that men avoid intimate conversations , anyway .
really ? what a surprising outcome .
he doesn &apos;t deserve you , jane .
can you please distract me
with some sort of scientific mumbo jumbo ?
you see the scarring in bernard &apos;s lungs ?
i &apos;m doing more testing , but it could be war lung .
we &apos;re seeing it in a lot of soldiers .
think of all the sad things we &apos;d avoid
if men would just talk about their problems
instead of going to war .
here are justin &apos;s lungs .
huh . no sign of war lung .
well , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
they served together ,
so they &apos;d be exposed to the same toxins .
shouldn &apos;t they both have it ?
yeah .
our medical miracle is here to thank us .
come on .
ugh . i &apos;m keeping my distance . i &apos;m afraid of that erection .
he &apos;s a little sexier alive .
hello . i &apos;m dr. isles .
i remember you .
are you checking his pulse ?
thank you for saving my life .
and you , too , detective . - ye-- - no .
i &apos;m ... not a hugger .
oh . okay .
well , this is for you .
thank you .
well , i heard what you did for me with that pen .
quick recovery . how &apos;s your throat ?
it &apos;s a little sore . otherwise , i feel great .
how did you get a gia dupont ?
why ? are you shocked
to see such a contemporary masterpiece
in a lowly police station ?
no .
you should be , because i &apos;d like to dismantle it for parts .
official police business coming through .
uh , excuse me .
damn shame about justin .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry , rondo .
who &apos;s this ?
oh , this is sour grapes , another one of my c.i.s.
we go way back .
i played the blues with this dude .
he could sing the panties right off ya .
boston &apos;s barry white right here .
that was another life .
hey , hey . you &apos;re raymond washington .
oh , my god , jane .
it &apos;s true about the panties .
ma .
your father and i used to go see him
all the time at the beehive .
tommy was conceived when --
no , i think it was frankie .
ma .
could we get these gentlemen some coffee ?
sure -- coffee .
i &apos;d prefer a glass of shiraz and a doughnut .
delish .
rondo , are you checking out my mother &apos;s --
i see the apple bottom doesn &apos;t fall far from the rizzoli tree .
stop .
okay .
what did you see ?
he killed justin .
who ?
pope john paul . think it &apos;s the second one .
you understand that &quot; c.i. &quot; does not mean &quot; crazy individual &quot; ?
it stands for &quot; confidential informant , &quot;
which means he provides information to solve a homicide .
but there &apos;s something here , vanilla .
i @-@ i just don &apos;t know what it is .
okay .
so , you &apos;re saying the man you saw looked like the pope ?
no , i &apos;m saying he is the pope ,
cruising around in his popemobile ...
taking out homeless folks .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , grapes .
whoa , whoa ! wait , wait ! t @-@ that &apos;s it .
there &apos;s this white dude --
self @-@ appointed sheriff of homeless town .
he reminds me of that pope , too .
okay . okay . i &apos;ll check it out .
check this out , too .
i got me a gut feeling it means something .
justin &apos;s intel .
i &apos;ll check it out
if you promise to sing for me one day , barry white .
no . no , no . i am not making that promise .
okay , well , give it to me . i &apos;ll look into it .
okay ?
thank you , rondo .
it &apos;s beautiful .
who &apos;s the artist ?
um ... me .
i call it &quot; the healing hand . &quot;
seems fitting to give it to you .
thank you .
sculpting &apos;s just a hobby .
i actually talk for a living .
oh , i @-@ i @-@ i know --
&quot; unleash your inner real winning self . &quot;
i , um ... i googled you .
well , then i guess you know i was heading to
akron for a speaking engagement before all this .
your vocal folds are only temporarily inflamed .
you likely had too much inderal .
wait . how did you find that on google ?
well , i @-@ i @-@ i had to look at your , you know , medical records ,
uh , you know , just to , uh ... just fill out your paperwork ,
so ...
do you have plans tonight ?
can i buy you dinner ?
if you promise not to die on me again .
that &apos;s a deal .
okay .
so , seven o &apos;clock ?
yeah . i &apos;ll see you then .
okay .
okay .
oh . excuse me .
angela .
who was that ?
look what i made --
cannoncini alla crema pasticcera .
yum .
i wish jane could meet a tall drink of water like that .
maybe if she learned how to make puff pastry ...
oh . i know .
especially after what happened with casey .
start talking .
hey , we know any neighborhood watch guys
that look like the pope ?
benedict ?
no , john paul ii .
i got a witness who says
he saw our suspect rousting homeless guys .
we have all the neighborhood watch volunteers on file .
let &apos;s look .
can you do a split @-@ screen of a picture of that guy
and one of the pope ?
jeff miller .
see what he drives .
pulling his dmv record .
drives a white dodge van with a bubble @-@ top sunroof .
your witness say that the bad guy drove the popemobile , too ?
why , yes , he did .
maybe jeff miller went from volunteer to vigilante .
all this reminds me of an agora .
an ancient greek marketplace .
not many people know that .
i bet you the greeks didn &apos;t have chili dogs like these .
these are the best in boston .
you know , hot dogs are made from the gonads ,
intestines , and eyeballs of hooved animals .
well ... they &apos;re still amazing .
okay , fine .
let &apos;s take a look at the art first .
i &apos;m sorry .
no .
what an exceptional piece .
and you have exceptional hands .
i would love to sculpt them .
what &apos;s the wildest ,
most outrageous thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
i ...
i rode nude on a horse at an equine dressage event .
well , i was protesting budget cuts
to my college equestrian team .
come on .
i think it &apos;s time for you to do something outrageous again .
what ?
that &apos;s impressive .
come on .
what a beautiful view of the city .
hey , be my lookout .
wha--
no . no , you -- you can &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s illegal .
art is not a crime .
come on . take a walk on the wild side .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re killing anyone .
all right .
take that .
uh ... no , no , no . i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t do that .
i @-@ i am the chief medical examiner
of the commonwealth of massachusetts .
well , tonight , you are a street artist .
drop the can !
hands on top of your head . turn around slowly .
uh @-@ oh . that &apos;s not good .
oh , you have no idea .
&quot; get the human trash off our streets . &quot;
i think we found mr. neighborhood watch .
piece of scum !
you leave my people alone .
keep your jackets on , guys . i got this .
&quot; hyah &quot; to you , too , dirtbag .
okay , step back , sir .
take this homeless sack of junk to jail .
you okay ?
can &apos;t even feel it .
where were you two nights ago ?
i was doing your job --
chasing down scum with citizen crime fighters .
they &apos;ll vouch for me .
if you think you &apos;re gonna pin these homeless murders on me ,
then you guys got another think coming .
okay , so we start with an arrest
for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon .
what dangerous weapon ?
that leg is damn dangerous .
thank you .
you look nice .
thank you .
so , your heart &apos;s on the mend , i guess ?
oh , my go-- maura told you about casey .
i can &apos;t believe charles would treat you like that .
ma .
i wish you would confide in me .
i @-@ i &apos;m right here .
really ?
really .
i &apos;m thinking of becoming a nun .
aw , baby .
why would you tell my mother about casey ?
sorry . jane , look !
oh , okay .
no problem . not mad .
why don &apos;t you tell her i got a vibrator , too ?
frankie wrote you up for vandalism ?
maura , you were tagging ?
i was with dennis .
never date a zombie . they have no respect for the law .
jane , i have a confession .
i liked it .
i liked it . i liked breaking the law .
it made me feel like who i used to be --
someone who took chances .
someone who commits felonies and can &apos;t keep her mouth shut .
that &apos;s great .
i just said i was sorry .
sorry to interrupt .
oh , that &apos;s okay -- we &apos;re just discussing
the case of the lovesick , blabbermouth tagger .
you have the results from bernard avery &apos;s lung biopsy ?
yes . it wasn &apos;t war lung .
toluene , acetone , propane , and butane .
was he huffing ?
no . it &apos;s spray paint .
he was exposed to a lot of it
over the course of months -- maybe years .
you think bernard was a tagger ?
maybe that &apos;s why he was in the alley .
this is a street beef .
is that a food truck ?
bernard was spray @-@ painting over another tagger &apos;s .
and he always had his tomahawk with him .
well , i wish that i could help you solve these murders ,
but , um ... i &apos;ll be in jail .
give me that .
use a tomahawk on my brother .
it could be a rival tagger , right ?
yeah .
these are all the graffiti photos
frankie took at the crime scene .
&quot; ra nad om . &quot;
you think yogis are tagging now ?
it &apos;s &quot; random , &quot; bro . it says &quot; random . &quot;
&quot; random . &quot; huh .
frankie . get in here .
ooh ! am i in trouble ?
yes .
you &apos;re charging the chief medical examiner with tagging ?
okay , can you two turn your heads , please ?
i need to &quot; hyah &quot; my brother .
it &apos;s bogus . my sergeant was there .
i wrote it up to get her and her ... boyfriend
the hell off the street .
meant to tell her . sorry .
i &apos;ll tell her .
keep seeing this one over and over -- &quot; penance . &quot;
there &apos;s no match in the graffiti task force database .
and this one , too -- &quot; blister . &quot;
&quot; dizzy monocles . &quot;
&quot; dizzy monkey , &quot; dude . can &apos;t you read ?
not graffiti .
&quot; blister &apos;s &quot; name is steve bogart .
he was a tagger .
now he &apos;s a documentary filmmaker .
been shooting boston &apos;s graffiti scene
for the last year .
we ever pick him up ?
doesn &apos;t look like it .
wait . this is interesting .
he &apos;s listed on a police report as a victim
of assault and battery .
look who the assailant was -- bernard avery .
how did we miss that ?
we ran bernard &apos;s record .
bernard wasn &apos;t charged .
steve bogart refused to prosecute .
maybe because he wanted to handle it himself --
with a tomahawk .
maybe . i &apos;ll get a warrant . we &apos;ll go pick him up .
let &apos;s do this .
watch yourself .
even with a warrant ?
yeah , when he swings that tomahawk at your head ,
just hold up that piece of paper .
i hate these loft apartments .
clear !
clear !
they weren &apos;t just looking for something .
they broke all his equipment .
you hear that ?
yeah .
it &apos;s coming from over there .
frankie !
frankie , let &apos;s wait for the hazmat team !
must have ...
snuck up and clunked him over the head .
didn &apos;t even get to drink his beer .
does it look like steve bogart ?
looks kind of like corned beef and cabbage .
i love humboldt fog .
i &apos;m so glad that you &apos;re not mad at me
for getting you into trouble .
well , jane is looking into it for us .
i &apos;m hoping that we can do community service .
ah , i wouldn &apos;t worry .
i know several prominent defense attorneys .
i hope that &apos;s not necessary .
um , i @-@ i can turn the air on if it &apos;s warm in here .
oh . no , it &apos;s fine .
you really do have good circulation .
i &apos;m sorry . i hope i &apos;m ... not making you uncomfortable .
i just thought that since i &apos;m asking you to be nude that ,
you know ... i should be , too .
pablo picasso did say , &quot; art is dangerous . &quot;
why not ?
we &apos;re going to jail anyway .
the skull has gaping wounds --
likely produced from the blade of a heavy weapon .
could it be ... from -- oh , i don &apos;t know -- a tomahawk ?
just a wild guess .
well , perhaps i could confirm the weapon
if you told me what my future wardrobe is --
forest @-@ green jumpsuit for my prison stay
or the fluorescent orange
for my court @-@ mandated trash @-@ collecting ?
does the zombie want to know , too ?
oh . i forgot to tell you -- he sculpts in the nude .
i want to hear everything .
a @-@ after we catch the tomahawk killer . focus .
i can &apos;t concentrate .
the thought of my impending incarceration --
stop !
okay , you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
martha stewart flourished in jail .
but she was in a minimum @-@ security prison .
where do taggers go ?
can you please just tell me if the wounds on steve bogart
are from the same weapon that killed justin and bernard ?
let me guess -- he smells ?
yes !
i really am preoccupied . don &apos;t you smell it ?
it &apos;s acetic acid .
cool ?
well , it is , because it tells me
he was killed more than 72 hours ago .
what -- three days ago ?
wait , so , steve here was killed before justin and bernard ?
oop ! i forgot something .
the summons that frankie wrote you was a fake .
you can wear your mcqueen on your next date with the zombie .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so relieved .
i can feel my cortisol level dropping .
wait !
w @-@ why did you let me suffer ?
trying to scare you straight .
i will never tag again .
just don &apos;t gossip with my mother .
that , too .
the killer was looking for something .
maybe bogart caught something on tape .
yeah , but what ? he didn &apos;t catch either murder on tape .
yeah .
yeah , he was already cooking in his jacuzzi
when bernard and justin were whacked .
what are you doing with this busted @-@ up keyboard here ?
it was justin &apos;s . let me see it .
he said it contained &quot; classified intel . &quot;
bernard trusted him . maybe ...
maybe the killer was looking for this .
see what &apos;s on it .
thanks .
canvases are selling for $ 25k each .
they &apos;ll be worth triple that
once my posters have been mass @-@ marketed .
you &apos;ll have to wait in line .
i think it &apos;s time we told this fancy crowd
who this talented artist is .
they know . it &apos;s me .
go ahead , frost !
why do you paint that boy ?
what is this ?
steve bogart &apos;s last documentary .
to give him peace .
you know how they make an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy
a suicide bomber ?
they tell him that the infidels will die
but he won &apos;t .
he was staring right at me when his face blew apart .
so calm .
that &apos;s why he was so haunted .
he couldn &apos;t kill that little boy .
you &apos;ve depicted that pain in your art .
it &apos;s not art !
and you can tell that guy that he can &apos;t have it !
you can &apos;t have it ! it &apos;s not for sale !
i let my friends die .
stop recording .
stop recording !
look , give me the video card !
give me -- give me the video card !
justin , take it --
you couldn &apos;t break through as an artist .
you didn &apos;t have the talent .
but bernard did .
he just showed up ,
started painting million @-@ dollar art in your alley .
you &apos;re crazy .
triple homicide -- that &apos;s crazy .
you killed steve bogart
because he had footage of bernard painting .
bernard didn &apos;t want your money .
you had to kill him to get these canvases .
they were in his shopping cart , right ?
and you killed justin because he was a witness .
you can &apos;t prove anything !
oh , i think we can .
note to self -- always get rid of the murder weapon .
you &apos;re gonna be famous after all .
cuff him .
come on .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been having this conversation in my head for a long time .
jane , it &apos;s not a good time to talk .
no , i @-@ i understand that it &apos;s not a good time to talk
when you &apos;re 6,000 miles away and people are shooting at you .
but you came home , and you didn &apos;t tell me .
and i don &apos;t understand why .
i don &apos;t want to have this conversation .
casey , you and i have been friends since high school .
and then , w @-@ when we saw each other again ,
i wasn &apos;t some goofy freshman
and -- and you weren &apos;t mr. big man on campus anymore .
we -- we were just people .
two people that had -- had been through some bad things .
i @-@ i fell in love with you .
jane , please .
and i know you did .
i know it .
because they sent you to some godforsaken , war @-@ torn desert ,
and you kept calling me to hear my voice .
and then i stopped , didn &apos;t i ?
i have your phone number .
if i &apos;d wanted to see you , i --
if i had anything to offer you , i would have reached out .
but i didn &apos;t , and i don &apos;t .
the only people in my life i have room for
are these wounded vets .
i &apos;m sorry , jane .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
you &apos;re a fool .
well , that was a great idea .
he said i was the girl of his dreams .
maybe it &apos;s just too hard for him
to be in a relationship right now .
yeah -- with me , ever .
jane , i &apos;m so sorry .
let &apos;s go do something crazy .
you feel like tagging ?
no .
god , no . not that crazy .
so , you mean like
&quot; graham crackers and canned frosting &quot; crazy ?
and a box of shiraz .
it &apos;s a little too peppery and full @-@ bodied --
work with me .
okay .
