we had sex , once
go out with me .
you know you &apos;re my boss , it &apos;s against the rules .
do you like izzie ? is that what this is about ?
izzie ? no ! she &apos;s not the one i &apos;m attracted to .
so there &apos;s a one .
ever been attracted to someone you couldn &apos;t have ?
meredith .
just coffee .
good .
ok .
ok .
your mother &apos;s alzheimer &apos;s is advancing .
so while she &apos;s lose enough to consent
she needs to sign everything to you .
me ?
thanks for the coffee .
so you blew me off for a bottle of tequila .
that &apos;s not nearly as much fun to wake up to .
you mind moving this tail wagon ?
you &apos;re blocking me in .
a couple hundred years ago ,
benjamin franklin shared with the world
the secret of his success .
&quot; never leave that till tomorrow , &quot; he said ,
&quot; which you can do today . &quot;
this is the man who discovered electricity .
he &apos;d think more of us would listen to what he had to say .
i don &apos;t know why we put things off ,
but if i had to guess ,
i &apos;d say it has a lot to do with fear .
fear of failure , fear of pain , fear of rejection .
wouldn &apos;t it be easier to just ask her out ?
she &apos;s gonna be late .
maybe not .
we should wait for her .
definitely not .
i &apos;m not her mother , and you are not her boyfriend .
not yet , anyway .
stop , ok ? i told you i &apos;m not interested .
life is short , george .
do you really want to die before you ever ask her out ?
i do not want to ask her out .
do you really want to die a liar ?
i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not dying .
sometimes , the fear is just of making a decision .
because , what if you &apos;re wrong ?
what if you &apos;re making a mistake you can &apos;t undo ?
crap .
crap !
hi . i &apos;m late .
you &apos;re avoiding me .
yes , but also late .
oh , are we going to talk about this ?
no
about us and bailey and what she saw ?
i don &apos;t need to talk about it .
i experienced it , naked .
this is getting complicated .
complicated for me .
i &apos;m the intern sleeping with the attending .
bailey isn &apos;t speaking to me anymore .
not that that &apos;s a bad thing .
if i was a better guy , i &apos;d walk away .
yes , you would .
do you want me to be a better guy ?
yes .
no .
crap .
i &apos;m late .
take your time .
think about it .
that was definitely worth being late .
thanks .
is this a ?
should we talk about this ?
yeah , definitely .
you &apos;re late .
so are you .
i know , and i can &apos;t afford to piss off bailey any more .
do you think she told anyone ?
about you and mcdreamy ?
yeah .
no , he &apos;s her boss too .
if they find out , what can they ?
can they kick me out , or ?
no ... not officially .
you &apos;ll just get edged out ,
blacklisted , banned from his surgeries ,
passed over for chief resident .
it &apos;ll be humiliating , but you &apos;ll live .
i have to end it .
i definitely have to end it .
i have to end it , right ?
meredith , shut up .
what ?
did you seriously just tell me to shut up ?
oh , please . you got a hot doctor
who likes to make you open up and say &quot; ah &quot;
it &apos;s the american dream , stop whining about it .
no. no good can come from sleeping with your boss .
cristina , you &apos;re late .
so is meredith .
whatever it is we &apos;re afraid of ,
one thing holds true .
that , by the time the pain of not doing a thing
gets worse than the fear of doing it ,
it can feel like we &apos;re carrying around a giant tumor .
when we walk in this door ,
you will maintain decorum .
you will not laugh , vomit , or drop your jaw .
are we understood ?
why would we laugh ?
oh , just you wait .
good morning , miss connors .
good morning .
what is it ?
tumor .
and you thought i was speaking metaphorically .
第一季 第6集
good morning , annie. how are you ?
this is dr. bailey , and these are my fellow interns .
dr. karev , we refer to patients as &quot; mister ... &quot;
i told him to call me &quot; annie . &quot;
&quot; miss connors &quot; makes me feel old and fat ,
which i am , but why feel that way ?
good morning .
annie , this is dr. burke. awesome surgeon .
dr. karev .
annie connors is a 43 @-@ year @-@ old woman who presented last night
with progressive shortness of breath the past three months .
found to have a very large tumor
of unknown origin pressed against her diaphragm .
stable vital signs .
scheduled for ct this morning , sir .
thank you , dr. karev. are you at all claustrophobic ?
i &apos;ve been housebound for the last year .
how claustrophobic could i be ?
all right . dr. stevens is going to take you up for a ct .
it &apos;ll give us a better look at the tumor ,
and we &apos;ll know how to proceed .
could someon tell my mom ?
she &apos;ll worry if she gets back , and i &apos;m not here .
yeah , of course. of course .
and would it be possible for alex to take me instead ?
i mean , he ...
he &apos;s just so fun to look at .
annie .
sure. sure , ms. connors .
excuse me .
how much do you think it weighs ?
60 pounds .
more. she &apos;s carrying a whole extra person .
this one &apos;s going in the books . i &apos;ve got to get in .
i almost did. have you ever seen alex like that ?
he actually seemed sincere .
&quot; seemed &quot; being the operative word .
he was on call when she came in .
i am never leaving this place again .
let &apos;s move , people .
ms. connor &apos;s surgery , should we choose to proceed ,
will take most , if not all , of the surgeons off the floor ,
which means you people
will have to work extra hard not to kill anyone ,
cause we won &apos;t be there to fix your mistakes .
dr. burke .
trauma team to or one .
trauma team to or one .
i really want in on this .
i thought we weren &apos;t talking .
i &apos;m not talking . i &apos;m just saying .
find her mother , get a family history ,
and i &apos;ll tell bailey .
mr. harper had a coronary bypass yesterday .
his blood pressure , currently 100 / l65 .
it was running low overnight down to 70 / l30,
but responded to medication .
postoperative labs show a crit of 30 and normal coagulation .
chest @-@ tube output has halted over the last two hours .
what &apos;s your plan ?
chest x @-@ ray and check the tube for possible occlusion .
good. he &apos;s doing fine .
thank you .
i know you think i like meredith ,
but i don &apos;t like meredith .
what ?
no . i like meredith. obviously , i like meredith .
i just ... i just don &apos;t have a thing for her .
ok .
it &apos;s just this morning ...
i know you were probably just teasing ,
but i don &apos;t want you to say anything to her .
we live together , and that &apos;d be awkward .
george , stop talking .
ok , then .
morning .
mr. levangie , this is dr. bailey
and her fine staff of surgical interns .
welcome to hell , kids .
who &apos;s presenting ?
edward levangie is a 63 @-@ year @-@ old man
admitted for pain management for dyskinesia .
he &apos;s been stable since last night ,
and responding to the bolus injections .
izzie , treatments ?
for parkinson &apos;s disease ?
deep brain stimulation has ...
not for parkinson &apos;s , for spinal pain .
intraspinal catheter .
that way , he can have constant pain medication .
excellent. this is dr. grey .
she &apos;s gonna prep you for the procedure and assist .
excuse me .
you make yourselves busy , i &apos;ll catch up with you .
miranda .
excuse me ?
well , that &apos;s your name , right ? it &apos;s on your jacket .
all right , i &apos;ll just call you bailey then .
you think you &apos;re charming in that talented , neurotic ,
overly moussed hair sort of way , good for you .
but if you think i &apos;m going to stand back
and watch while you favor her ...
i don &apos;t favor her. she &apos;s good .
i &apos;m sure she is .
can i point out that ,
technically , i &apos;m your boss ?
you don &apos;t scare me .
look , i &apos;m not going to advertise
your extracurricular activities with my intern .
however , the next time i see you favoring meredith
i &apos;ll make sure she doesn &apos;t see
the inside of an or for a month .
just for the sake of balance .
we &apos;re all set , doc .
ok .
there &apos;s going to be a microphone in there for you
in case you get scared or you want to get out ,
but try not to do that ,
because then we &apos;re going to have to start all over again .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;ll be fine .
i know you &apos;re going to be fine , because i &apos;m going to be
right over there , behind that glass , waiting for you .
all right ?
ok .
you ready ?
are you really ready ? let &apos;s do this .
see ya .
oh , hey , man , you got an extra battery ?
unbelievable .
oh , i know , right ?
i &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
god .
well , what i don &apos;t understand ...
is how a person lets it get like that .
i mean , man , that is a whole lot of nasty .
maybe she &apos;s afraid of doctors. poor thing .
poor thing ? please .
if you &apos;re afraid of doctors , you take a pill .
she &apos;s just sick , like , warped , you know ?
seriously , i don &apos;t know how she lives with herself .
well , at first , we thought she was just putting on weight .
when we realized what was happening ,
i tried to get her to go to the doctor ,
but she was scared .
and , the bigger it got , the less she wanted to go .
and she never really felt all that sick until last night .
she couldn &apos;t breathe .
because the tumor was crushing her lungs .
yes , well , i called 911 .
it just seemed like the right thing to do .
you know , the right thing to do
would have been to call a year ago
thank you .
ok , mr. levangie .
we &apos;re going to get you more comfortable , ok ?
i &apos;m going to go downstairs , and i &apos;ll be back up shortly .
ok .
ok .
excuse me .
i &apos;m sorry , doctor ... grey .
my dad seems to like you .
he &apos;s always liked skinny blondes .
is that rude ? i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so tired .
is there something ?
i was wondering if you would talk to him .
about ?
brain surgery .
the doctor mentioned it , and i &apos;ve read about it online .
if it worked , it could help
with most of his symptoms , not just his pain .
is he a candidate ?
he is , but he &apos;s afraid of it .
surgery on his back , he can understand ,
but his brain ... and there are risks .
but his quality of life ...
there isn &apos;t any .
and , it keeps getting worse .
i &apos;m getting married next month .
i already lost my mom .
and i want him to walk ...
i want him with me. maybe that &apos;s selfish , but ...
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like having a parent ...
watching him ...
i do .
i do know what it &apos;s like .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
thank you .
the right hemidiaphragm is so high
that it &apos;s completely displacing her lung tissue .
it &apos;s infiltrated her spinal canal in three places .
we should start there .
it &apos;s going to take 3 or 4 hours just to get around those nerves .
i &apos;d prefer to start in front ,
and then flip her .
you never know what vessels are involved .
how intertwined they are .
i &apos;m going to need a good head start .
i should really go with these spinal canals .
if i miss a step , she &apos;s paralyzed .
if i don &apos;t relieve the pressure on her lungs ,
she will be dead .
so she won &apos;t mind if she can &apos;t walk .
do you think she really wants to live ?
come on. she &apos;s been housebound .
she &apos;s been living under this thing , for how long ?
just watching it grow for how long ?
she doesn &apos;t seem stupid . doesn &apos;t even seem all that scared .
why would anyone wait this long , unless they wanted to die ?
people do things every day
that they know could kill them .
doesn &apos;t mean they want to die .
what are her chances of surviving the surgery ?
slightly better than if we do nothing .
so is it worth it ? hey , come on .
you were already thinking it , i &apos;m just saying .
she &apos;s 43. it &apos;s worth a try .
dr. shepherd .
mr. levangie , the parkinson &apos;s patient ,
a good candidate for dbs ?
yes , but he &apos;s not interested .
ok , but i think it &apos;s worth talking to him again , pushing him
we &apos;re talking about a brain surgery
that is performed while the patient is wide awake ,
there is a risk of paralysis , a risk of death
if the patient doesn &apos;t want it .
it is not my job to push him into anything
and it &apos;s definitely not yours .
ok ...
since you &apos;re clearly uncomfortable with my decision .
it &apos;s best you &apos;d not scrub in
but ...
it &apos;s minor procedure. you won &apos;t be missed .
you know , they call you the nazi .
so i &apos;ve heard .
dr. conserva , 3742 . dr. conserva , 3742 , stat .
i won &apos;t lie to you .
the surgery is going to be long and difficult ,
but we have an extremely capable surgical team , and i can ...
am i going to die ?
there &apos;s always that risk , but if we don &apos;t do the surgery ...
i &apos;ll definitely die .
yes .
soon ?
yes .
mom , the room &apos;s clean .
ok , honey , ok .
mom !
she &apos;ll have the surgery .
mom !
no. no , annie .
she will have the surgery .
i guess i &apos;ll have the surgery .
i think that is a very wise decision .
on one condition . i don &apos;t want him there .
i &apos;m sorry , annie. did i upset you in some way ?
if he &apos;s in the surgery , i &apos;m not having it .
that &apos;s how i live with myself .
ok , miss connors .
dr. karev .
what the hell did you do ?
nothing . i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
man. the mike must have been on .
i was talking to the teck guy .
if anything goes wrong
anything
you are 60 percent more likely to be sued
if you &apos;ve offended the patient , 60 percent
i never would have said that .
the micro shouldn &apos;t have been on .
i didn &apos;t realize she could hear me .
now you won &apos;t realize your chance to scrub in .
you &apos;re banned from the or. mine or anyone else &apos;s. all week .
i got the history on the tumor .
it &apos;s been growing for a year and a half .
a year and a half.it &apos;s the first time she &apos;s even had it looked at .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s fatally lazy .
why doesn &apos;t she get banned ?
go prep annie connors for surgery .
you &apos;re scrubbing in with cristina .
really ? i mean , thank you. ok .
we just need to recheck your labs
and get an ekg ,
so i just need to take a little blood .
dr. burke is great , and dr. bailey .
i know you &apos;re probably scared .
that &apos;s ok , kitten .
you can just do your job .
you don &apos;t have to talk to the fat , nasty tumor lady .
i mean , i let it get this bad .
how much sympathy do i deserve .
why did you let it get this bad ?
you &apos;re the first person since i got here to ask me that .
well , i guess it &apos;s just like the elephant in the room .
elephant ?
i mean ...
it &apos;s more like a giant sow , don &apos;t you think ?
every time i went to the hospital , someone died .
all four of my grandparents , then my dad .
my best friend &apos;s mom ,
my baby sister .
they all went in , never came out .
so i put it off .
you know , you &apos;re not the only one to put things off .
i never do anything till the last possible minute .
like what ?
well ...
i &apos;ve had this thing for my roommate since , like , day one ,
and i just ... i can &apos;t tell her .
she probably wouldn &apos;t go out with me , anyway , but ...
how do i know that for sure ,
if i don &apos;t ever ask ?
seriously ?
you &apos;re equating your pathetic love
life with my record breaking tumor .
seriously ?
it &apos;s just that he blatantly favors me in front of her
and then blatantly dismisses me .
how do you know he was favoring you ?
look , you &apos;ve got a brain .
you got into this program .
just because shepherd munching your cookies
doesn &apos;t mean you didn &apos;t deserve what you worked for .
but he &apos;s making me look bad .
i have to end it .
right .
it &apos;s over .
is it true you get to scrub in on that tumor ?
don &apos;t sit here .
you get to scrub in ?
how psyched are you ?
on a scale of one to ecstatic , ecstatic .
you know what i think ?
i think burke wants to get into your scrubs .
why are you sitting here ?
he kicked me off that surgery
for the same crap you poured everyday .
if i stuck this fork into his thigh , would i get in trouble ?
not if you make it look like an accident .
hey .
hi ! hello
thank god , man . i &apos;m drowning in estrogen here .
you look ... is everything ok ?
shepherd &apos;s a jackass .
really ? i think he &apos;s kind of great .
he reamed her out in front of bailey .
why ?
cause he &apos;s a jackass .
well , bad days are ... bad .
maybe tonight , uh , if , you know ,
if you drink alcohol , i mean , we could
all of us , i mean , go out and drink alcohol ...
because of the bad day .
i got to go .
dude .
shut up !
how &apos;s your back ?
still good .
good. how are you ?
can you lean forward for me ? i want to check something .
does that feel ok ?
yeah .
right here ?
did you page ?
mr. levangie , have you given any more thought
about the other surgical options we discussed this morning ?
what ?
why would i ? i already told you no .
i &apos;m letting you cut into my back ,
but that &apos;s not enough for you .
all you guys ever want to do is cut .
dad , just listen to what he has to say .
i already listened .
sir , there &apos;s a very small window of opportunity here .
once the parkinson &apos;s progresses to a point of dementia ,
you &apos;re no longer a candidate for dbs .
and when i &apos;m no longer a candidate ,
is that when you people will leave me the hell alone !
what ?
do i have to start drooling , and forget my name
to get a little peace and quiet ?
all right . i &apos;ll check back with you later .
try to get some rest .
dad , you &apos;re being unreasonable .
the doctors are only trying to help you .
it &apos;s my damn life , and it &apos;s my damn brain .
you want me to let them cut up my brain
while i &apos;m lying here awake , for what ?
dad !
i &apos;ll be at your wedding .
i will sit in the back .
your uncle will walk you down the aisle .
i know it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s life .
life is messy sometimes .
i know that .
if she knows ,
then what the hell are we still talking for , huh ?
why in hell can &apos;t she drop it ?
it is your life. but it &apos;s her life too .
and you have a chance to get better here .
and all she &apos;s asking you to do is try .
if they pull this off ,
i &apos;m totally calling oprah .
you two been working out ?
sometimes i jog ,
and i try to take the stairs whenever possible .
why ?
see that large pile of tumor ?
you &apos;re going to be retracting it for the next 14 hours ,
so i &apos;m just saying i hope you have strong backs .
dr. shepherd .
yes ?
mr. levangie has agreed to dbs .
if we do it today .
if he leaves , he won &apos;t come back .
don &apos;t worry , dr. shepherd .
it &apos;ll take hours before we get around to the spine .
i &apos;ll page you .
all right , then .
let &apos;s do it .
dr. bailey .
i didn &apos;t know ...
that he was my boss ,
when i met him . i didn &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t care .
really ?
oh , well , you sort of seemed to not be talking to me , so i ...
you see this , what &apos;s happening right here ?
this is the problem with you sleeping with my boss .
not whether or not you knew him before ,
but how it affects my day .
and me standing here talking to you
about your sex life affects my day .
and the longer this little fling goes on ,
the more favors you get over the others ,
who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it
through this program without any assistance .
when those people start finding out what &apos;s going on
and they don &apos;t want to work with you
and talk to you or look at you ,
and they start bitching and moaning at me ,
the more it affects my day .
so , no , dr. grey ,
i don &apos;t care what you knew , or when you knew it .
are we understood ?
yes .
good .
this sucks .
i &apos;m not a real fan of yours , either .
not you. this. everyone is scrubbed in somewhere .
bright side , we have the run of the floor .
want to do it in the stairwell ?
i &apos;m just saying you never know what could happen .
i &apos;m changing .
i &apos;ll page you if i need you .
you do that .
you are so my favorite person today .
begin more suction .
we need to hang another bag of o @-@ neg .
cauterizing the small bleeders
to keep my visual field clean .
god , is your back killing you ?
george , shut up. we &apos;re in here .
hold it right there .
mrs. harper , let me show you these chest films .
we were able to relieve the obstruction of his chest tube ,
so the buildup of fluid you see should resolve itself soon .
which translates as he should be home in no time .
he was making waffles .
i &apos;m sorry ?
he was making waffles .
he was mixing the batter , and ...
and then , he was on the floor .
izzie , we need a central line run in 204 .
page dr. karev , will you ?
he &apos;s not answering .
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;ll be back .
like what you see , right ?
neuro sponge .
how you doing , mr. levangie ?
all right .
drill bit &apos;s charged .
where &apos;s blondie ?
i &apos;m right here. can &apos;t you see me ?
i &apos;m shaky . i &apos;m not blind .
anything goes wrong here , i &apos;m blaming you .
ok , in that case , i &apos;ll stay where you can see me .
we have to drill a hole and try to find
the spot that controls the motor function .
you can &apos;t see my brain from there .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be learning something ?
i &apos;m good , right here .
eeg waves look good .
ok , mr. levangie .
just take a couple deep breaths .
focus on the pretty girl .
this is going to sound really scary , but try and relax .
you shouldn &apos;t feel a thing .
any pain here ? here ?
no .
here ?
no
dr. stevens , i need you to check the x @-@ ray in 2103 .
2118 needs post @-@ op notes , and jane &apos;s wondering
if you want her to start feeding 2112 .
i &apos;m going on break .
ok , yeah , before you do that ,
could you page dr. karev again ?
i already paged him .
again ?
irrigation .
little more pressure .
excuse me. how is it ?
long and slow . i don &apos;t envy those two .
they &apos;ve been holding that thing for eight hours .
their arms have to be ready to fall off .
look at the size of this artery .
my god .
it &apos;s as thick as a thumb .
you ever seen a vessel this size ?
no .
this thing &apos;s just feeding on all her blood .
we need more o @-@ negative .
i &apos;ll call the blood bank .
damn it , o &apos;malley. you want me to kill this patient ?
no , i ... sorry .
i mean , is the art of retracting just too much for you ?
no , i was , uh ...
i had an itch .
way to go , george. nicely done .
just keep trying , mr. levangie. mimic my motions .
you can do it .
you &apos;re doing great , mr . levangie. just a little longer .
oh , damn it !
take a breath and try again .
one more time , mr. levangie .
the probe is almost in .
you &apos;ll know it when we find the right spot .
well , how about that ?
there it is .
i &apos;ll be a son of a bitch .
bailey was on the warpath . i was trying to protect you .
you trying to protect me is why she &apos;s on the warpath .
you can &apos;t do me favors .
you can &apos;t ask me to scrub in , when i haven &apos;t earned it .
ok , ok .
you can &apos;t treat me like crap when i haven &apos;t earned that .
i can take care of myself .
i got myself into this mess , and i ...
and you &apos;ll get yourself out ?
i don &apos;t ... know that yet .
don &apos;t let me keep you .
you did great work here today .
dr. shepherd .
yeah ?
sorry i called you a jackass .
you didn &apos;t .
i did . twice .
tell you what , blondie .
if you don &apos;t marry him , i will .
no , no , no , jimmy ! no , no , jimmy , no !
what we got ?
pressure plummeted to 64 / l22,
and he has runs of v @-@ tach that aren &apos;t perfusing .
cvp is sky @-@ high .
give him dopamine , ten mikes .
he &apos;s maxed out .
the resident was here an hour ago . i can &apos;t reach him .
of course you can &apos;t .
do something ! what &apos;s the matter ?
get her out of here !
no , no !
mrs. harper , you have to get out of here .
does he have a myocardial ischemia ?
no , it &apos;s a clot. big one .
page someone . page anyone .
it &apos;s tamponade . he &apos;ll be dead before they get here .
you have to open him up , right here , right now .
you said he was ok !
get out of here now !
you have to cut .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve never seen it done .
i could kill him .
do nothing , you &apos;ll kill him faster .
what &apos;s your glove size ?
six .
oh , god. oh , god .
take a breath , dr. stevens .
she has to move over there .
walter , move out of the way .
cut the stitches and then the staples .
don &apos;t let them fall into the chest cavity .
wait . i &apos;ve never cracked a chest before .
oh , god. oh , god .
no pulse. wide complex rhythm .
i can &apos;t get this clot out .
i need more suction . i need more .
he &apos;s bradying down. you have to get the clot out .
i can &apos;t get it .
screw it . i &apos;m using my hand .
oh , god , look at the size of that clot .
anything ?
no .
you have to massage the heart , doctor .
come on. come on .
come on , please .

god , it &apos;s unbelievable .

watch what you say. you never know who &apos;s listening .
look at george .
he looks like he &apos;s about to fall in .
are you really as shallow and callous as you seem ?
oh , you want to go out for a drink later
and hear about my secret pain ?
does that line ever work for you ?
sometimes .
must be because you look like that .
like what ?
so is that a yes ?
no .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m seeing someone .
look , if you don &apos;t want to go out with me , just say so .
no need to lie .
oh , ok .
well , i don &apos;t want to go out with you .
but i think i really might be seeing someone .
yeah. no , it &apos;s up here .
it &apos;s up here. it &apos;s up here .
we &apos;re still in the middle of surgery .

the artery walls are too weak .

i got it !
the early bird catches the worm .
a stitch in time saves nine .
messy .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be. you saved his life .
he who hesitates is lost .
we can &apos;t pretend we haven &apos;t been told .
we &apos;ve all heard the proverbs ,
heard the philosophers ,
heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time ,
heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day .
still , sometimes , we have to see for ourselves .
i &apos;m not doing you any more favors .
this was it .
i &apos;ve been holding up 50 pounds of tumor for the past 12 hours .
my back &apos;s going to need traction ,
and the patient died anyways .
and you think you did me a favor ?
look , i &apos;m just ...
what is this ...
that we &apos;re doing here ?
what is it ?
you need a definition ?
you really want to be that guy ?
we have to make our own mistakes .
lock the door .
we have to learn our own lessons .
have you seen meredith ?
save yourself the misery , man. she &apos;s off the market .
what ? no , that &apos;s not ... we &apos;re just friends .
whatever .
but she &apos;s not . i mean , if she was seeing someone ,
i live with her , i would know it .
we have to sweep today &apos;s possibility under tomorrow &apos;s rug
until we can &apos;t anymore ,
until we finally understand for ourselves
what benjamin franklin meant .
that knowing is better than wondering .
that waking is better than sleeping .
i , um , know this place
where there &apos;s an amazing view of sunrise over the ferryboats .
i have a thing for ferryboats .
i remember .
and that even the biggest failure ,
even the worst , most intractable mistake
