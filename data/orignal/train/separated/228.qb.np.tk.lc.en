gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i want the movie rights to this book ,
and since you &apos;re good friends with the author ,
that shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
uh , we &apos;re not exactly on good terms right now .
i told alessandra that i &apos;m giving you the book rights .
i do have one condition .
i want to write the screenplay .
what are those ?
my late husband bart had his investigator
research our whole family .
there &apos;s a story in that safe . i saw it myself .
i want to return these to you .
and ... you &apos;re not gonna use them ever ?
anything of value in these was already on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
&quot; dr. eliza barnes . &quot;
you look like you need to talk .
i do .
you never had a childhood ,
so you behave like a child in the worst ways .
your superficial connections and lack of authentic emotion
leave you isolated and alone .
throwing away your loyal family
for a fiancee you shouldn &apos;t trust .
do you really believe she has no other secrets ?
i would never lie to you . you know that .
i never know with you .
i have a problem i was hoping you could help me with .
i &apos;d like to meet so i could tell you more in person .
i &apos;m more than willing to pay for your time .
they say the road of life is long and winding ,
so it &apos;s important to mark the milestones along your way ,
from picking your bridesmaids ...
so many minions .
how you ever going to decide ?
tryouts begin after breakfast .
all right , let &apos;s put the bar up front ,
the d.j. in back , and the caterers
can sit up in the bullpen
and we toss out those moving boxes .
nate , can i add one more thing to your to @-@ do list ?
definitely .
to christening your boss &apos; new desk ...
oh , my ...
landing on your first best seller list ...
number nine .
&quot; inside &quot; by daniel humphrey .
what did , uh , lincoln hawk &apos;s first single debut at ?
eight .
ah , but don &apos;t pay too much attention to that stuff .
that was the &apos; 90s .
to finally asking for help .
so how are you feeling today ?
fit as a fiddle .
but keep your eyes on the road , upper east siders ,
or you could get lost along the way .
that was a productive morning .
yeah , i got a lot accomplished
in a short amount of time , didn &apos;t i ?
don &apos;t gloat .
if anyone deserves top marks , it &apos;s me .
mm .
now zip me up .
so i was thinking about the party tonight ,
and i was thinking that maybe you could be my date .
you &apos;re joking .
you &apos;re not ?
i mean , isn &apos;t it time we finally told the world we &apos;re a couple ?
i can &apos;t think of a better time than tonight .
i can &apos;t think of a worse one .
tonight &apos;s the public launch of my new media empire .
i &apos;m showing new york city who i am .
besides , we both knew that female bosses
can &apos;t mix business and pleasure
without people whispering about them behind their back .
okay , but i &apos;d still like you to meet a few of my friends .
i mean , can we at least talk about that ?
of course .
right after you and charlie deliver
the new &quot; spectator &quot; tablets to all our v.i.p. guests .
you ever heard of a messenger service ?
so some unattractive delivery guy
can hand them to an assistant
who &apos;s just gonna sell them on ebay ?
i don &apos;t think so .
here is your list .
charlie ?
i mean , seriously ? this is like four pages long .
don &apos;t pout .
charlie , you are east side . nate , you &apos;re west .
and i have to run because i am late for a meeting
with an old friend from l.a.
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have worn heels today .
the dream starts the same every time .
they have a habit of doing that .
皮鞋
in my new berluti wingtips .
i look up ,
and a block away is the most magnificent skyscraper
i &apos;ve ever seen .
i have to get inside it ,
but every time i round the corner ,
it &apos;s still a block away .
so what do you do ?
i start to run , but as soon as i reach it--
you wake up .
what do you think the dream is about ?
my father &apos;s tragic death ?
my mother &apos;s secret life ?
or perhaps my chronic oral fixation .
i appreciate your sense of humor , charles , but--
but you think it &apos;s just a defense mechanism
against intensive therapy .
be honest . you know you &apos;re holding back .
how can you be so sure i &apos;m hiding something ?
maybe i &apos;m wrong ,
but i feel there &apos;s a piece of the puzzle still missing .
it &apos;s not your mother or your father .
there &apos;s someone you &apos;re not telling me about .
good morning , blair .
mmm . don &apos;t you just adore us ?
why do i feel like there &apos;s a request coming ?
not a request . a special dispensation .
for what ?
scheming and manipulating .
who do you work for ?
louis , can &apos;t you just turn a blind eye
for ... let &apos;s say 24 hours ?
blair ...
all i &apos;d be doing is spending the day with my former minions .
maybe some light waterboarding involved .
but i &apos;ve been so good for so long .
and once i &apos;m her serene highness of monaco ,
all meddling will be prohibe .
queen b. need last hurrah .
are you sure that &apos;s such a good idea ?
forgive me . i &apos;ve just never understood
this upper east side tradition of yours .
i know , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re perfect together .
you don &apos;t have the scheme gene like i do .
you don &apos;t get the itch .
maybe it hormonal .
darling , it &apos;s just one day .
je reviens tout de suite .
okay . i give up .
i &apos;ll look away .
but only until the party tonight .
that &apos;s more than enough time .
commenced !
don &apos;t worry , my love . nobody will get hurt ...
that badly . mmm .
hey , dan &apos;s on his way up .
serena , i want you to meet a dear old friend of mine--
diana payne .
serena .
i think you came to a party at my house in los angeles ,
but i was indisposed . so good to finally meet you .
so nice to meet you , too .
serena &apos;s my latest find .
a month ago , her job was getting my director
three shots over ice .
now i &apos;ve got her optioning best sellers for me .
i &apos;m going to go get a tart cherry juice
and call david o. russell .
i &apos;ll be back in time for our meeting .
it &apos;s such a small world .
my good friend nate archibald actually works for you ,
and my cousin , charlie rhodes .
oh , yes . well , they &apos;ve both been instrumental in helping me
rebrand &quot; the spectator . &quot;
oh .
i hope you &apos;ll be coming to our launch party tonight .
oh , no , i wasn &apos;t planning on it .
oh , but you should .
in fact , someone like you with your influence
should have her own place to speak her mind .
have you ever thought about blogging for a web site ?
i know my readers would love to hear
every detail about your life .
oh , well , there &apos;s already somebody who &apos;s all over that .
i &apos;m not really a fan of her work .
gossip girl doesn &apos;t have the monopoly
on serena van der woodsen , does she ?
no , but i &apos;ve been hurt enough by what she &apos;s said .
that i could never willingly take part
in something like that .
i hope you &apos;ll come to the party anyway .
it &apos;d be great to keep talking .
bye .
as faithful minions through the years ,
you &apos;ve each earned a chance to be immortalized as a bridesmaid
in my royal wedding . but legally ,
i must warn you , not everyone will survive the tryouts .
so i &apos;ve drafted a waiver for you to sign
in the event of a catastrophe .
kati , penelope ,
nice to see constance so ably represented .
jessica , columbia &apos;s finest .
blair , it &apos;s always been my dream to be your bridesmaid--
do yourself a favor and stop talking right now .
even pippa knew when to pipe down .
where &apos;s nelly yuki ?
yale , where she got in and you didn &apos;t ,
plus she hates you , remember ?
well , an odd number just won &apos;t do .
we need another contestant .
charlie .
you &apos;re the maid of honor &apos;s cousin .
you should be in the mix , too .
what are you doing right now ?
nothing ?
then get in line ... if you dare .
能来布莱尔家帮我取平板电脑吗
hello , doctor .
what &apos;s this ?
the rest of what i owe you .
i told you it &apos;d be worth your while .
now you can settle all of your father &apos;s debts .
what do you want me to do ?
just make sure my fiancee will never fall for him again .
louis , that &apos;s up to blair .
no . it &apos;s up to you
to turn chuck back into the monster he was
for the first 20 years of his life .
he &apos;s a time bomb . find his fuse and light it .
looks like louis is about to make
young bass &apos; road to recovery a very bumpy ride .
better buckle up , chuck .
dr. barnes , what are you doing here ?
a house call is a little out of the ordinary
in my line of work , but i felt our last interaction
ended too abruptly . may--may i sit ?
of course .
i was hoping that being in your environment might help .
well , i applaud your persistence , dr. barnes ,
but i &apos;ve searched the far corners of my mind ,
and i &apos;m not hiding anything ,
from you or myself .
i &apos;m an open book .
then let &apos;s skip to the chapter about blair waldorf .
i live in this city . i read the papers
just like everyone else .
you &apos;ve done your homework ,
but i don &apos;t see how my history with blair
or the tabloid fodder it produces
is really relevant to my therapy .
it &apos;s relevant if the blair is the source of your suffering .
aren &apos;t you upset that the love of your life
is marrying someone else ?
i let blair go . let &apos;s leave it at that .
you &apos;re actually telling me you &apos;re not furious .
next chapter .
have you ever thought it &apos;s your denial of these feelings
that &apos;s giving you nightmares ?
expressing your rage and anger is part of your healing process .
you can &apos;t move on until you let it out .
you have to face that you didn &apos;t let blair go .
you lost her to someone else .
you don &apos;t know what i did .
but yes .
maybe there is something else i need to do
if i &apos;m ever going to move on .
i don &apos;t want to lie to you .
i don &apos;t want to lie to myself .
if i &apos;ve really let blair go ,
i don &apos;t need this anymore .
it &apos;s beautiful .
i bought it to give to her .
i &apos;ve been keeping hold of it ever since .
and really what i should do is just return it .
if that &apos;s what you need to do , you should do it .
you take it . just ... give it to charity or something .
i don &apos;t care . just-- just--just take it away .
thank you .
so , mr . screenwriter ,
are you ready for your first ever development meeting ?
i think so , as long as you guys don &apos;t want to change the ending
or the beginning
or all the stuff in the middle .
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;ll love working with jane .
ahh ! there he is !
we &apos;re so excited .
dan , this is 纳塔丽 , my exec at warners .
so nice to
love , love , love your book--
the characters , the voice ,
everything .
honestly , you should just transfer the novel
straight to final draft .
copy , paste , done .
wow . thank you . do you don &apos;t have any notes
before i start writing ?
well , we &apos;d love if you could open up
the world of upper east side a little bit more .
rich people are so hard to like .
maybe you can add someone more relatable ?
i ... thought i did that already .
i @-@ i think dan is referring
to his main character , dylan hunter .
he &apos;ll appeal to everyone .
he starts off as an innocent from brooklyn--
who quotes hawthorne and screens fellini films ?
i don &apos;t think so .
we need a real outsider as a hero .
a tragic backstory would give him more to overcome .
maybe he &apos;s an orphan .
wait . wait--
now another thought that occurred to me
was to &quot; glee &quot; this up .
you know , music-- originals or covers .
okay , stop . what &apos;s going on ?
i thought we were talking about
turning this into an important independent film .
dan , relax , we &apos;re just talking .
about turning my book into &quot; newsies . &quot;
&quot; inside &quot; is my life .
and thank you so much ,
but i don &apos;t need anyone to tell me how to write it .
a royal wedding is more than just
the most glamorous event on the social calendar .
it is also the most dangerous .
people will try to kidnap you
and break you for the details .
paparazzi will tap your phones .
i need to know who of you
is going to crack under the pressure .
the contest today will simulate
how you perform your bridesmaids duties under extreme duress .
now fall in line !
dressing me for my wedding day
means attending to my every need ,
no matter how big or small .
adjust for reception ! cinch that train !
penelope ... she has to pee !
okay .
where secret wedding location ? !
we don &apos;t know !
who design ms. blair wedding dress ? !
we can &apos;t tell you that !
good one , jessica .
now block that baby bump !
blocking .
what baby bump ?
lets go , girls ! faster ! who wants it ? !
you know the rules ! you trip , you &apos;re out !
you spill , you &apos;re out !
come on !
nice work , charlie . i like what i see .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
you sicken me .
may i help you ?
yeah . i work for diana payne , and she wanted me
to hand @-@ deliver keith gessen the new &quot; spectator &quot; tablet .
it &apos;ll serve as his invitation for the party tonight .
keith doesn &apos;t need an invitation ,
since he &apos;ll be attending with diana .
oh , but i &apos;ll gladly take the tablet myself .
wait . so ... he &apos;s going as her date ?
hello ! they &apos;ve been going out for two months .
i thought you worked in media .
i know this morning was a total disaster ,
but nobody blames you .
whatever jane sent you here to say ,
why don &apos;t you just say it ?
well , we both think that you should waive your right
to write the script .
why would i do that ?
because if you write it ,
your project will be stuck in development hell .
you &apos;ll write a draft . a year later ,
you &apos;ll still be rewriting it , and you &apos;ll never give them
what they want because you &apos;re too close to it .
and that &apos;s not even the point .
well , it sounds like it was .
dan , you &apos;re a huge novelist now .
i don &apos;t know about huge . i mean , i &apos;m number nine .
and next week , you &apos;ll be number one .
i &apos;ll take two . i &apos;m not greedy .
seriously , you should be focusing
on your next best seller .
let us hire an &quot; a &quot; list writer
like--like an akiva goldsman ,
somebody who jane can &apos;t bully ,
somebody who gets great movies made
and who will honor your book faithfully .
you really think you could get someone like him to write it ?
absolutely .
jane works with oscar winners all the time .
but how can i guarantee
that she &apos;s not just gonna screw it up ?
because i won &apos;t let her .
she may not know this world , but i do ,
and i will protect your story and you .
careful , s.
i have your word ?
you have my word .
everybody knows the road to hell
is paved with good intentions
and shady bosses .
hello ?
hey .
there you are .
why aren &apos;t you back here yet ?
i got a little hung up at keith gessen &apos;s office .
were you ever even gonna tell me that
you &apos;re bringing him as your date tonight ?
of course .
i wanted to say something this morning , but , um--
but you were too busy lecturing me
on how you can &apos;t mix business with pleasure , right ?
keith &apos;s just business , really . you are both .
but no one can know that i am .
not right now .
i know you don &apos;t understand , but you need to trust me .
no , you know what i need to do ?
is rethink this whole relationship .
get me charlie rhodes .
okay , dan &apos;s off the project .
take a bow , serena .
you &apos;re a star . how &apos;d you accomplish it ?
well , i just convinced him
that--that he and his novel would be better served
by a top @-@ tier screenwriter .
and he will be .
sorkin &apos;s agent called right after you left .
aaron sorkin ?
is adapting &quot; inside . &quot;
oh , my g-- what ?
that &apos;s--that &apos;s incredible .
how did you get that to happen so fast ?
i had sorkin lined up for a week .
his agent and i were just waiting .
for ... me to convince dan to quit ?
so this explains your &quot; inside : the musical &quot; pitch .
come on . i always knew that dan was never going to work out .
i just gave him a little nudge . be happy .
sorkin is a good thing .
i just wish we could have spared everyone the drama this morning .
are you kidding ? dan coming in this morning
did more for this project than you &apos;ll ever know .
why ?
because we got to see what this movie should really be .
a self @-@ important teenager
who betrays his friends for fame and fortune .
&quot; inside &quot; will be the next &quot; social network . &quot;
we &apos;re going to zuckerberg him .
jane , this-- this isn &apos;t fair .
i prefer to let the audience decide what &apos;s fair or not .
dan is not like that .
why don &apos;t i put a dinner on the books for all of us ?
and this way , you &apos;ll see .
the next time i see dan will be at cannes
when i &apos;m shaking his grateful hand on the dais .
i have a call to make .
see you at the party tonight ?
congratulations , girls .
you &apos;ve survived the most physically
and mentally challenging day of your lives ,
and all you have to show for it are a few bruises .
now for the final round ,
you will be accompanying me and my prince
to the fabulous &quot; spectator &quot; launch party tonight .
we &apos;re going to play a little game
with one of the guests there .
well , who &apos;s the target ?
a boy , of course .
i &apos;m listening .
at the wedding , you &apos;ll be the apple
of every bachelor &apos;s eye .
so i need to know who is going to bag a baron
and who &apos;s going to embarrass me .
with a busboy .
exactly .
so ...
tonight , whoever &apos;s the first to get a kiss
from one of new york &apos;s most eligible bachelors
wins the right to call herself my ... royal bridesmaid .
so tell us , who is it ?
dorota ?
will you do the honors ?
nate archibald !
i am so all over this .
yes ! yes . oh , my god .
so excited !
hello ?
why is nate calling me from keith gessen &apos;s office ?
all i asked you to do was make a few simple deliveries
to a few specific people ,
and you botched it .
i know .
i &apos;m so sorry , but blair &apos;s having a competition
to pick her bridesmaids , and if i win ,
i can cover the royal wedding for &quot; the spectator . &quot;
then you &apos;d better win , for your sake .
i just ... have one more task to complete .
hey . hey .
uh , are you free tonight ?
jane was--was hoping that you would be my guest
to &quot; the spectator &quot; party .
let me guess .
jane loves me again now that i quit the movie .
i think she just wants to get to know you better--
the real you .
so be super nice , okay ?
i &apos;m always nice . yeah , i &apos;ll see you tonight .
spotted--s trying to navigate a slippery slope .
but she &apos;s not the only accident waiting to happen .
hey . did you get my texts ?
oh . i ... turned my phone off , actually .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m good .
he says , teeth clenched .
come on . let me help .
i &apos;m really good with other people &apos;s problems .
not so much my own , but ...
well , there &apos;s this-- there &apos;s this girl .
and i asked her to be my date to the party tonight .
and she said &quot; no . &quot;
which was fine ,
until i find out that she &apos;s bringing another guy .
do you think that she &apos;s trying to let you down easy ?
easy &apos;s not her style , no .
well , then she &apos;s trying to make you jealous .
trust me , nate . we &apos;re all the same .
okay , so what do i do ?
fight fire with fire .
take me as your date .
well , no . i wouldn &apos;t wanna--
i wouldn &apos;t wanna ruin your night . i ...
you won &apos;t .
pick me up at 6 : 00 .
whew . you &apos;re getting excited , aren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re getting excited .
come on , dr. barnes .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
and i wouldn &apos;t be , if you answered any of my calls .
i told you , i &apos;m done .
i can &apos;t be responsible for destroying a young man
who &apos;s doing everything he can to heal himself .
and what about our deal ?
as much as it would have helped , here &apos;s your refund .
at the tone , please record your message .
dr. barnes , it &apos;s chuck .
i think i &apos;m in trouble .
can you meet me tonight ?
when you drive chuck over the edge ,
it &apos;s you who will wind up roadkill .
so how was your day ?
just what i needed .
old habits die hard .
hello .
if they die at all .
what are they doing here ?
i thought we agreed we &apos;d be done by tonight .
and i will be , my dear .
the girls just have one more tiny , little thing to take care of .
you won &apos;t even notice they &apos;re here .
where &apos;s nate ?
where &apos;s charlie ?
game on .
you look amazing .
i wanted to offer my sincerest congratulations .
chuck bass .
diana payne . so nice to meet you .
i &apos;ve heard a lot about you ,
and let me just say , the best of it does you no justice .
i &apos;m sorry . have we met before ?
not that i can recall .
it &apos;s funny . just looking at you now , i could have sworn--
i think i &apos;d remember . enjoy the party .
chuck .
your highness , always a pleasure .
give it a rest , bass .
i &apos;m sorry . my friend is here . dan .
jane , hey . thank you so much for inviting me .
i appreciate it .
of course . i &apos;m just so happy you can make it .
serena , look , i found dan .
did you already tell him
we got sorkin to write the movie ?
what ? no . that &apos;s incredible .
i know . now your character will talk even faster than you do .
you--you mind if i call my agent and tell her ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
don &apos;t think i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing
by bringing him here .
you can &apos;t guilt @-@ trip me into changing my mind
about the lead character .
i just wanted you to get to know the real dan .
he--he &apos;s ... genuine and caring and funny .
the zuckerberg version is the better story .
the better movie .
i gave dan my word that i would protect him .
he &apos;s one of my best friends . please don &apos;t do this to him .
it &apos;s already done .
and you know what ?
i &apos;m taking you off this project ,
effective immediately .
like dan , you &apos;re just too close to it .
nate , these offices are so big .
you have to show me yours .
oh , i &apos;d love to . yeah , we got a lot of , uh--
ah ! there you are .
i was waiting for you at the bar .
well , you &apos;ll have to keep waiting .
nate just promised me a tour .
of the office . i &apos;ll come with .
no , i wanna see your &quot; spectator , &quot; not hers .
sorry , charlie .
ooh , is that a hellman @-@ chang table ?
oh , my !
serena , you came after all . i &apos;m delighted .
so ... what do you think of &quot; the spectator &quot; ?
everyone seems to be having fun .
except for you .
what ? i can &apos;t help but pry .
of course you don &apos;t have to tell me .
i just ... got myself into a situation
that &apos;s gonna hurt somebody i really care about .
i thought i could fix it tonight , but i--
i can &apos;t .
maybe i can . i &apos;m quite the problem solver .
i don &apos;t think you wanna know . it involves a friend of yours .
jane ?
now you have to tell me .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s about the book option i got for her .
i need to kill the project .
give me two seconds , and it &apos;ll vanish .
thank you , but--but i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll figure it out on my own .
you just said you couldn &apos;t .
jane and i have history .
she doesn &apos;t always like to be reminded of it ,
and it &apos;s been a while since i did .
what kind of history ?
some things are best left to the imagination .
so ...
how bad do you want your problem to go away ?
jane .
yes ?
a word .
oh , just kiss him and win already .
anybody with eyes can see nate has a huge crush on you .
i give up .
i would ,
but i &apos;m starting to feel like i &apos;m not nate &apos;s type .
hello ? ! nate doesn &apos;t have a type .
he &apos;s like derek jeter .
现为纽约洋基队队长
well , when he saw you ,
he said that you were the hottest girl at constance .
nate said that ?
oh , my god . what else did he say ?
something about how you were the only girl at constance
he wished that he had hooked up with but never did .
until now .
thanks , man . i appreciate that .
let &apos;s do this .
penelope ! what did i tell you about consorting with the help ?
you &apos;re dismissed .
what ? it &apos;s not my fault she tripped .
hey . uh , you leaving already ?
i &apos;m sorry . i have to go .
i was hoping we could talk more about the movie .
what movie ? it &apos;s dead .
if you want to know why ,
talk to your friend serena .
i know the night &apos;s still young and the bar &apos;s still open ,
but i wanted to take a moment to thank everybody for coming .
it means so much to me
to know that if a bomb went off right this second ,
new york media would be over .
hey . thanks for being my date .
of course . i just hope we were able
to make whoever you &apos;re seeing jealous .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t even think she really cared .
let &apos;s make her care .
i &apos;m game if you are .
yeah ?
we are going to be different from &quot; gossip girl &quot;
and other anonymous sites
which traffic in damaging rumors and innuendo .
i &apos;m sorry . where was i ?
the &quot; spectator &quot; is only going to print facts .
if you did it ,
you deserve to get caught ,
and we &apos;re gonna catch you .
so with apologies to my other esteemed editors ,
starting tonight , i &apos;m gonna be poaching your best reporters
and stealing all your best stories .
i have a story for you .
so let &apos;s hear it , mr. bass .
my therapist , dr. eliza barnes , has been using hypnosis
to coerce me into performing ... unspeakable acts .
i am dr. barnes ,
and i promise you that none of this is true .
it &apos;s okay , chuck .
y @-@ you &apos;re in a very vulnerable psychological state right now .
i wonder why .
maybe because i just found out
you were taking money
to reveal confidential information about me .
now that &apos;s a story i can print ...
if you have proof .
chuck , stop .
why are you doing this ?
if you don &apos;t believe me ,
you should ask your fiance .
he &apos;s the one who paid her .
don &apos;t worry , b.
you &apos;re still marrying a prince ...
of fools .
blair , wait .
please , i know how upset you must be .
after all this arguing about my scheming ,
what you &apos;ve been doing is even worse .
but i can explain .
what possible explanation could you have for ...
paying chuck &apos;s therapist to spy on him ?
i found the paternity test ...
the one that you &apos;d torn to pieces .
oh , my god .
you didn &apos;t tell me you weren &apos;t sure who the father was .
no , i ...
i had to get the test .
yeah , so you could decide who to be with ?
no . so we both could have peace of mind ,
knowing that what i prayed for in my heart was true .
the paternity test showed me that some part of you thought
you might still have a choice to make .
and i needed you to see
that chuck will always be the wrong one .
louis ...
i don &apos;t know how many more times i can say this ,
but chuck and i can never work .
you know that for certain ?
i do .
so does he .
and so should you .
chuck destroys everything and everybody in his life .
and he &apos;ll never change .
but what &apos;s scaring me is that ..
you &apos;re changing into him .
did you just kill my movie ?
only because i had no other choice .
but i did it for you .
for me ? are you kidding ?
listen , please--
tell me one thing .
was this your plan from the very beginning ?
what ?
admit it . you hate your character in the book so much ,
you couldn &apos;t stand to see this made into a movie .
millions of people might judge you ,
and we all know how much you like that .
actually , for the record ,
having the project killed had nothing to do with my image
and everything to do with yours .
jane was gonna do a hatchet job on you ,
and now i &apos;m gonna get fired for stopping her .
that was fun .
more fun that you expected ?
a lot more . i mean , maybe we should
just stage another make @-@ out session .
you know , just for us .
congratulations !
looks like you won blair &apos;s contest .
wait , what ? what is she talking about ?
oh . didn &apos;t you know ?
this was all a game .
charlie only kissed you so she could be one of blair &apos;s bridesmaids .
for the &quot; spectator &quot; of course .
guess she left that part out .
nate , i &apos;m sorry .
oh . don &apos;t fret , charlie .
i &apos;m sure nate wasn &apos;t completely honest with you either .
were you , honey ?
right then . i &apos;d better get back to my real date .
keep up the good work , charlie .
cheers .
what , so you used me to get a story ?
the &quot; girl &quot; you &apos;re seeing is our boss ? !
well , if it isn &apos;t the good doctor .
i thought you should know i &apos;m gonna shut down my practice .
why ?
i know people say therapy &apos;s a waste of time ,
but you did wonders with my trust issues .
i understand you &apos;re angry .
i don &apos;t expect you to ever forgive me .
i just thought you should know
louis wasn &apos;t paying me for information alone .
he wanted me to drive you into a rage ,
to turn you into this monster you apparently used to be .
louis is so threatened by you
that he wanted to remind blair--
why she chose him .
maybe louis is right .
he doesn &apos;t have to be .
you can change .
do you remember this morning when i asked you about blair ?
i was trying to provoke you .
but you chose something else ,
something better .
you chose to let go .
continue down that road ,
and i &apos;ll bet you &apos;ll find some peace .
i &apos;ve always wondered what that felt like .
good luck .
and i &apos;m sorry .
i really did want to help .
spotted--chuck bass standing at the crossroads .
looks like we &apos;re gonna have to watch his every step .
serena ...
word on the street is you &apos;re back on the job market .
you don &apos;t waste any time , do you ?
not when i know what i want .
there must be some way i can convince you
to write a blog for &quot; the spectator . &quot;
not if it &apos;s about the upper east side
or anyone who lives there , including me .
i &apos;m sorry . i know that i owe you a favor .
but i don &apos;t wanna be the next gossip girl .
i @-@ i don &apos;t believe in attacking people online
and spreading rumors .
neither do i ,
which is why i wanna take gossip girl down .
how ? everyone reads her ,
and whether they admit it or not ,
everyone posts .
this city is addicted to her .
only because she writes about people like you .
think about it .
if you and your friends
are the main reason people care about gossip girl ,
and starting tomorrow ,
everyone can read about you straight from the source .
that would make &quot; gossip girl &quot; irrelevant , wouldn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t know .
yes , you do .
serena , this is a chance to have your own voice ,
to stop the lies and to finally control your own image .
aren &apos;t you tired of swimming in gossip girl &apos;s fishbowl ?
well , i &apos;d have to do it my own way .
i &apos;d expect nothing less .
come by tomorrow , and we &apos;ll brainstorm together .
okay .
good night .
good night .
no more games .
no more secrets .
either we &apos;re in this for the world to see ,
or we end this right here .
somebody here to apologize .
well , i can &apos;t say i want to hear it right now ,
but ... tell louis i &apos;ll see him upstairs .
not louis .
what are you doing here ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t have the energy to rehash tonight &apos;s hysterics .
i think you should leave .
i &apos;m not here to apologize about what happened tonight .
then ... what are you here to apologize for ?
everything else .
i &apos;m sorry for losing my temper
the night you told me louis proposed to you .
i &apos;m sorry for not waiting longer at the empire state building .
i &apos;m sorry for treating you like property .
i &apos;m sorry ...
i didn &apos;t tell you i loved you when i knew i did .
but most of all , i &apos;m sorry
that i gave up on us when you never did .
thank you .
i hope never giving up on people
isn &apos;t gonna be my downfall .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to be an amazing mother .
you &apos;re always there for the people you love ,
even when they don &apos;t deserve it .
you know that &apos;s never gonna change .
it &apos;s okay if it has to .
starting tonight , i &apos;m going to take care of myself .
is that all ?
yeah .
they say every road comes to an end ,
but sometimes the end feels just like the beginning ,
even when you think you &apos;ve come a long way ...
dad ? what , uh , what are you still doing here ?
mm . after i talked to you at the party ,
jonathan karp called .
he got an advance copy of next week &apos;s best seller list .
i &apos;m not number one .
did i go up at all ?
you dropped off the list .
but when i told him the news about aaron sorkin ,
he said a big movie deal announcement like that
will have the books flying off the shelves again .
the movie &apos;s dead , dad . it &apos;s over . i &apos;m--i &apos;m done .
you can suddenly find yourself right back where you started .
because every journey
is fraught with twists and turns ...
you know , charlie ,
you &apos;re becoming more trouble than you &apos;re worth .
i had no idea you were the one nate was trying to make jealous .
i just wanted to get the inside scoop on blair &apos;s wedding .
well ...
now you know ,
and so does the rest of the world .
nate &apos;s mine .
do i make myself clear ?
good .
because i &apos;d hate to have to run a story tomorrow
about a poor girl from florida
who clark rockefeller &apos;ed the upper east side .
主人公克拉克 · 洛克菲勒一直假扮各种身份的人物
and one false step could spell disaster .
but no matter what ...
但是大多数时间他们根本不清楚他们在说什么 。
you still have to stay the course
and forge your own path .
no , louis , i @-@ i know you &apos;re sorry .
you should go on your trip .
we can talk when you get back .
promise .
besides , a few days apart would be good for us .
because there &apos;s no going back now .
and it looks like this one &apos;s going to be
the ride of our lives .
