where &apos;d you get the phone ?
brandon was right .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back in touch with ty .
all i ask is that you keep me in the loop .
mariana ...
ana ... she put us all through a lot .
it &apos;s gonna take time to trust her .
i would like to buy myself a car .
for now , the answer is no .
happy birthday !
i saved it from my quinceanera and my allowance ...
so you can get a car that moms will approve .
but what if we bought a car together ?
i &apos;m in .
i was talking to my pianist , jin ...
and i said , what a raw deal i thought you got .
so that means i &apos;m back in ?
you had sex with wyatt ?
it only happened once .
and what about lying to me ? is that a one time thing , too ?
&quot; super callie ? &quot; you &apos;re such a dork .
so , what kind of powers does super callie have ?
does she fly ?
she doesn &apos;t just fly ...
it &apos;s more like ... gravitation of manipulation .
like riding gravity waves .
yeah , she flies .
and why do you only ...
draw , like , superheroes ?
i understand those kinda stories .
what ? are you about to tell me you &apos;re like ...
like captain america or something ?
no .
i guess i just spent a long time hoping that
i &apos;m more than what the world thinks of me .
well , thank you ...
for the ... for the drawing .
it &apos;s my favorite birthday gift .
it &apos;s your favorite ?
wait . is that him ?
lookin &apos; good , mister man !
ty , this is callie .
she &apos;s the girl that got me with her foster family .
i appreciate you lookin &apos; out for my baby bro , callie .
it &apos;s been hard for him being the less handsome hensdale boy ...
it &apos;s nice to meet you , ty .
um , i &apos;m gonna go meet mariana , but i &apos;ll see you at home .
all right .
i see you got yourself a little shorty .
oh , there ain &apos;t nothing going on .
so , does she know ?
know what ?
that we &apos;re leaving .
okay .
i guess these belong to you now .
ah ! thank you .
ooh ! don &apos;t forget to move your car for street cleaning .
those tickets are a racket !
thank you for the heads up .
oh , my god !
i can &apos;t believe we just bought a car .
so ...
what should we name her ?
how about &quot; lucille &quot; ?
she looks like a lucille .
do you want to break her in ? i could use a ride to work .
well , i can &apos;t drive you anywhere until we have insurance .
and since we &apos;re not 18 , that &apos;s gonna require telling moms .
okay . well , do you wanna break the news then ?
mariana , it &apos;s not that simple .
we can &apos;t just tell moms we bought a car ,
and then hit them up for money for insurance .
that stuff &apos;s expensive .
okay .
between the two of us , it shouldn &apos;t take long to save up .
yeah , until then , lucille has to stay parked on the street .
okay , fine .
i guess i &apos;ll just ride the bus .
i guess you will , huh ?
callie , is that you ?
yeah !
could you come here , please ?
um ... what are you ...
we asked rita to stop by
because we wanted to talk to her about you and a.j.
um , what about us ?
i saw the two of you kiss , after the party .
uh ... okay , it only happened that once .
and i know that nothing ... we can &apos;t ...
while he &apos;s living here , so ...
do you like a.j. ?
i don &apos;t know how i feel .
but i do know that i don &apos;t want a bunch of ...
drama again .
and yet , here we are .
honey , we just ...
we can &apos;t risk anything affecting your adoption .
the only way to protect everyone ...
is to separate you and a.j.
you guys can &apos;t live in this house together .
so , what are you gonna do ?
so , the plan is , we share jin .
the three of us agreed to a chinese wall .
no pun intended .
i &apos;m completely neutral .
i promise i won &apos;t say anything about what the other &apos;s working on .
you sure you &apos;re okay taking on two composers ?
it &apos;s a lot of extra work .
it &apos;s also two shots to play at disney hall .
all right , then .
welcome back , brandon .
thank you for giving me another shot , guys . seriously .
this place is crazy and everyone &apos;s so intense .
it &apos;s nice to make some real friends .
no worries , man .
we gotta look out for each other when we can .
shouldn &apos;t he be home by now ?
well , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just running late .
do you feel like you need me to stick around ?
no , i got it .
and i think it &apos;s better if i talk to him alone .
all right .
how &apos;d it go with ty ?
um , it was good .
he really wants to meet you ,
like we talked about . that &apos;s okay , right ?
yeah .
all right .
i just want him to see that you &apos;re cool and everything .
yeah , of course . any time .
listen , uh ,
there &apos;s something else we need to talk about .
well , whatever happened to that girl ? what was her name ? kat ?
oh , yeah . um , she got kicked out
and went back to toronto .
wow ! so , what &apos;s your story , a.j. ?
what kind of stuff are you into ?
oh ! he &apos;s a really good artist .
yeah ?
he did this super @-@ awesome
superhero drawing for callie &apos;s birthday .
what did you call her ?
um , super callie .
that &apos;s funny . callie , how &apos;s your app coming ...
that whole , you know , work @-@ study independent thing ?
well , it &apos;s fine . actually , i have to present
for the advisor &apos;s board tomorrow .
fingers crossed . but , no , i &apos;m like , really excited about it .
i picked up a bunch of coding from mariana .
that &apos;s cool . what &apos;s coding ? seriously . no , what is it ?
well , we have a little bit of an announcement ...
a.j. is not going to be staying with us any longer .
he isn &apos;t ?
he &apos;s going to be staying with rita .
yes .
just until i get my foster license .
why ?
uh , our license is expired ,
and with callie &apos;s adoption coming up soon ,
you know , we &apos;re not going to take the courses to renew .
we just have a lot on our plates right now .
yeah , and i &apos;m happy to host a.j.
at my place for a couple of weeks .
when are you leaving ?
oh , rita has just gotta get a quick home @-@ study from cps .
so , probably a day or two .
yeah .
well , we &apos;ll be sorry to see you go .
we really will .
at least there &apos;ll be one less
person in the bathroom in the morning , right ?
you said it .
that &apos;s positive thinking .
well , i was gonna wait for jude to get back from connor &apos;s
to make my big announcement ,
but it seems like we kinda need some good news .
so ...
ana asked me to be isabella &apos;s godmother .
oh , honey !
well , that &apos;s really great , love .
that &apos;s a great honor .
it sure is .
and isabella &apos;s not the only one that &apos;s gonna get baptized .
meaning ?
i am , too .
in the catholic church ?
yeah .
no .
what do you mean , no ?
i mean no .
okay , yeah , yeah , yeah . i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
but this is not brandon all over again .
okay , this thing with a.j .... yeah , it shouldn &apos;t have happened ,
but it &apos;s not like i &apos;m in love with him .
okay .
listen ...
i &apos;ve been doing really , really good on my food plan .
really . i &apos;ve been , like , dieting and exercising and ...
um , i lost a little bit of weight . thanks so much for noticing .
okay ?
uh , last week ,
i ate a cake .
not a piece of cake .
an entire cake .
right ? and i didn &apos;t even really enjoy it .
and i felt so bad about myself .
i &apos;m like , &quot; rita , why did you do that ?
why did you eat the whole cake ? &quot; then i realized .
it was a habit .
i did it because it &apos;s a habit .
and habits ...
they are really hard to break . right ?
you gotta be smart , callie .
you can &apos;t go through life just repeating the same mistakes .
i won &apos;t . i promise .
promise ?
promise .
yeah ?
yeah .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry ... about all this .
i mean , it &apos;s not fair .
it &apos;s not all bad . maybe if i &apos;m at rita &apos;s ,
we can ...
no , we can &apos;t .
i have a lot going on right now .
and i really ... i just need to focus on myself .
okay . yeah .
i get it .
i just ... i don &apos;t get the big deal .
didn &apos;t you baptize brandon ?
yes ...
but that was more for my father .
well , why can &apos;t i do this for ana and victor ?
victor &apos;s just worried that ...
if i don &apos;t , he won &apos;t see me in heaven .
oh , my god .
honey , that is just ridiculous .
not to him .
and don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a good insurance policy ?
i mean , just in case .
we don &apos;t believe in heaven and hell , mariana .
well , then what do we believe in ?
it &apos;s not like we ever go to church . do we even believe in god ?
well ...
we believe in love .
and in a higher power that lives within all things .
one that inspires us
to be kind and compassionate to each other .
what we don &apos;t believe in , is an angry old man up in the sky ,
threatening to send us to hell , if we don &apos;t do as he says .
i don &apos;t like the gutierrezes scaring you .
i &apos;m not scared .
and look , i know the catholic church isn &apos;t ,
like , pro @-@ choice or whatever ,
and it doesn &apos;t support gay marriage .
or the use of contraception .
but i don &apos;t have to believe in any of that . i &apos;m not converting .
i just ... i want to be isabella &apos;s godmother ,
and i can &apos;t if i don &apos;t get baptized .
so , you sorry to see him go ?
i know you aren &apos;t .
i mean , are you buying
the reasons moms say he has to go to rita &apos;s ?
why ? aren &apos;t you ?
yeah , i mean , i guess so .
so , how &apos;s idyllwild ?
uh , good . well , i think .
i &apos;m trying something kind of ...
weird for my new piece .
um , and i have to play a part of it in class this week ,
and i &apos;m just thinking it might be too risky .
so ...
if you &apos;re asking my advice ,
i don &apos;t know the black keys from the white ones ,
but isn &apos;t there someone at idyllwild that you trust ?
yeah ...
i guess .
there you go .
so , what &apos;d you think ? am i ... crazy ? be honest .
prepared piano ...
it &apos;s bold .
too bold ?
there &apos;s no such thing .
is it risky ? hell , yeah .
but that doesn &apos;t mean you shouldn &apos;t play it .
okay , but put yourself in my shoes here .
i &apos;m not exactly in a position
to take risks , you know .
not after they just barely let me back into the program .
i &apos;m for it .
i &apos;ve never heard anything like it played here .
but of course , i don &apos;t have a vote .
what would you do ?
i still have time to convert it , you know ,
back to a traditional piece .
ah ! you know i can &apos;t make that decision for you , dude .
look , you just gotta go with this .
you gotta go with your gut .
right , yeah .
go with my gut .
and what &apos;s your gut saying when you want to throw up ?
wait . so , your moms don &apos;t want you to be the godmother anymore ?
why not ?
i don &apos;t know . i think it just kinda caught them off @-@ guard .
they &apos;ll come around .
i hope so .
abuelo victor &apos;s been talking about it all morning .
he &apos;s so excited .
stop monitoring my every move !
just tell me why you need a refill .
those pills should &apos;ve lasted you another week .
because i ran out , okay ?
i lost them and i needed some more .
it &apos;s none of your business anyway !
it is my business , ana , if you are abusing your pain medication .
well , i &apos;m not ! so , stop scrutinizing every single thing i do .
i just need some air .
ana ?
back to work , mijas . andale .
i &apos;ll be in the back .
hey . what are you ...
we would like to have a conversation with the gutierrezes ,
if that &apos;s all right ?
our church provides us with a sense of community
and a sense of purpose .
we just wanted to share that with mariana .
is that so bad ?
you told our daughter that she &apos;s going to hell .
i never said that .
really ?
okay , but if you &apos;re afraid
that you won &apos;t meet her in heaven ,
what other option is there , victor ?
if mariana isn &apos;t baptized before she dies ,
her soul will be in limbo .
and we don &apos;t want her to suffer , waiting for purification ,
before she joins god in heaven .
we didn &apos;t mean to overstep .
hey , um ... my moms just want to talk about the baptism .
we wouldn &apos;t be in this position
if ana had had her children baptized in the first place .
it &apos;s something i really regret .
we hear you , and we understand , ana ...
but here &apos;s the thing .
jesus and mariana are not your children .
or your grandchildren .
you have a relationship with mariana because we allow it .
it &apos;s not your place to parent her .
they &apos;re right . they &apos;re her parents .
i &apos;m sorry . i should &apos;ve asked permission before any of this .
yes . yes , you should have .
fine . you &apos;re right . absolutely .
but let me ask you something .
you don &apos;t go to church , right ?
no , we don &apos;t .
so , do you not believe in god ?
that &apos;s a fairly personal question , elena .
okay . then , tell me this .
is there any reason you
don &apos;t want your children to believe in god ?
ty . mike .
nice to finally meet you .
can i get you something to drink ?
water &apos;s cool .
okay .
so , he &apos;s a cop ?
ty , be cool .
so ...
a lonely white cop wants to foster a black teen .
oh , i &apos;ve seen this movie before .
let me guess . you &apos;re gonna save my brother from being dangerous ,
violent , and criminally inclined , right ?
i &apos;m not interested in saving anybody .
i &apos;m fostering a.j. , so i can provide him with a home .
until he ages out .
he &apos;s almost 18 .
what ?
you need a few months of government checks that bad ?
ty !
it &apos;s okay .
look , i &apos;m not just in this till he turns 18 .
i &apos;m not gonna just throw him out !
i want him to go to college , get an education .
i &apos;m gonna support him any way i can .
look , i &apos;m not in this for just a few months . this is forever .
foster kids have no control
over where they live ,
who they live with .
so , this app , &quot; fost and found , &quot;
will give them the access and
information they need , so they can have some power ,
so they can make decisions for themselves .
why can &apos;t they just look those things up on the internet ?
well , most foster kids
don &apos;t know what they need .
so , they don &apos;t know what to search for .
so , this web app will help direct them .
you know , like two organizations that provide
donated prom dresses or ...
two dental clinics that provide free teeth cleanings .
there &apos;s even a summer camp for foster kids that &apos;s free .
but most of us don &apos;t even know these things exist .
i know i didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s all great stuff ,
no doubt about it ,
but your old independent study at the drop @-@ in center
was so interactive .
you got such terrific face @-@ to @-@ face time with the kids .
this just seems so much less ...
immersive .
so , how much longer were you at
that other foster house before you moved in here ?
i &apos;m actually moving out of that
house and into a different one for a little while .
mike still hasn &apos;t gotten his foster license .
say what now ? why are you moving around so much ?
i kissed my foster sister .
hold up . that callie girl ?
why doesn &apos;t she have to move out ?
because ...
because the black kid kissed the white girl , and that &apos;s a big no .
that &apos;s not how it is , ty . one of her moms is black .
whatever . they &apos;re moving
your ass out because they &apos;re gettin &apos; rid of you .
they don &apos;t want you to have anything to do with that girl .
no , man . it &apos;s not like that .
listen to me , a.j ...
this mike is not your forever father .
they are getting rid of you .
as sure as i &apos;m sitting here .
as soon as you wake up
and realize that , you give me a call .
hey ! you guys hungry ? grub &apos;s up .
great work , brandon .
really nice . glad to have you back .
that &apos;s all we have time for .
we &apos;ll hear from the rest of you tomorrow .
dude , that was sweet .
really tight .
thanks for , you know , the advice .
no , all i said was to follow your gut .
you can &apos;t go wrong with that .
hey ! so ...
i liked your piece .
i really did ,
but i feel like you &apos;re holding back , brandon .
you &apos;ve got to be more imaginative ,
braver , and bolder .
this is the time to take chances .
you &apos;re not going to get anywhere , definitely not disney hall ,
by playing it safe .
so , cps did the home visit , so we &apos;re good to go .
great !
i thought , maybe ,
we could go over some house rules before we move you in tomorrow ?
okay .
so , i saw you and brandon get into it at callie &apos;s party .
and mike told me
that you &apos;re talking to your brother and that &apos;s fine ,
but there will be no lying .
understood ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
okay .
i also know that you &apos;re the reason
that callie got fired from the drop @-@ in center .
what ? what do you mean , callie got fired ?
what happened ?
it was before i even met you .
it &apos;s kinda how i ended up in detention .
what did you do ?
she let me spend the night there ,
and i took off .
stole some spray paint .
i see .
she didn &apos;t want stef and lena to find out , so ...
okay .
listen , didn &apos;t mean to narc on you there .
okay ?
but the point is ,
there are no second chances with me .
there &apos;ll be no lying ,
no stealing ,
no running away , no fighting .
one strike and you &apos;re out .
you got it ?
got it .
i can &apos;t believe she had the nerve to ask us
if we didn &apos;t want our kids to believe in god .
what the hell was that ?
and what the hell business is it of theirs ?
i agree with you , love .
i totally , absolutely agree with you .
but you know ,
we haven &apos;t exactly exposed our kids to anything .
we don &apos;t go to church . we don &apos;t pray .
i mean , is it our fault that mariana went running
to the first person that talked to her about god ?
no , no , no , no .
this was not an invitation to learn more about the catholic church .
this was ... this was an ultimatum . this was blackmail .
victor literally said ,
you cannot be godmother if you &apos;re not baptized .
what is that ?
it &apos;s their beliefs .
well ...
it &apos;s not their place to
impose their beliefs on our daughter .
i agree .
but , you know , we &apos;ve always said
that we would allow our children
to choose their own spiritual paths .
i don &apos;t know . when does that ... when does that start ?
i should &apos;ve told you about the drop @-@ in center and everything .
trying to protect callie ?
i know .
look ...
are you interested in her ?
like , romantically ?
relax , it &apos;s not a trick question .
i honestly want to know .
yeah , i guess .
i mean , i &apos;m not sure she &apos;s interested in me ,
but if she was , would that be a problem ?
i mean , it &apos;s okay if i &apos;m living with
you and rita , right ?
look , i think callie &apos;s a great girl ...
honest .
i just don &apos;t think ...
getting involved with her is a great idea .
how come ?
she just has a lot of stuff to work out . and ...
she comes with more than her fair share of drama .
there &apos;s just a lot of other girls out there , a.j ...
i just think you might be better off .
that &apos;s all .
good night .

sorry i &apos;m late .
she &apos;s been fussy all morning .
here , let me .
so , have you talked to father pena yet ?
uh , no , not yet .
where are your moms ?
um , they &apos;re not coming .
so , are you okay ?
i heard you and elena fighting yesterday , and ...
and you want to know if i &apos;m abusing my pain killers .
i flushed them , the whole bottle .
i &apos;ve been trying to live with the pain ,
but i finally realized i can &apos;t .
so , i got a refill .
why didn &apos;t you tell your mom that ?
because my parents only see me as an addict .
if they had the slightest idea
that i was worried about relapsing ,
they &apos;d be all over me .
so , you &apos;re cool ?
i promise .
i ...
i &apos;m sorry this has caused so much trouble .
but i want you to know
how much it means to me ,
not getting you and jesus baptized
was just another reminder of the million ways
i was a terrible mother .
look who &apos;s here .
you came .
of course we came .
and we come bearing gifts .
one of those in there is for you ,
and the other is for isabella ,
to commemorate your godmother @-@ goddaughter bond .
so pretty . thank you .
mariana , are we ready ?
um , yes .
father pena , these are my moms .
lovely to meet you .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
pleasure .
shall we ?
now , i know you weren &apos;t raised in the church ,
but i &apos;m happy to see that
your reunion with your grandparents is ...
my birth grandparents .
of course . um ...
i &apos;m happy to see that your reunion with your birth grandparents
has ignited an interest in a spiritual connection .
normally , before we do this ,
there &apos;s quite a bit of instruction ,
but these are obviously very special circumstances .
so , then i &apos;ll bring you up and introduce you
as mariana gutierrez ...
no , no , no . &quot; adams foster . &quot;
right . i &apos;m sorry . i knew that .
i &apos;m just getting everything wrong today , aren &apos;t i ?
it &apos;s fine .
so , then , at the altar , you &apos;ll repeat after me ,
and recite the following oath
before your congregation and god .
&quot; i believe and profess all that the holy catholic church
believes , teaches , and proclaims ,
to be revealed by god . &quot;
is it a sin
to say the oath and not believe it ?
well , it is a sin to lie ,
but what don &apos;t you believe ?
well , you met my moms .
they &apos;re married . would the church accept them ?
of course . we welcome all sinners .
rita told mike i got you fired .
and then , he told me
that i &apos;m supposed to stay away from you .
he said what ?
and then , i realized that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to rita &apos;s .
i crossed the line .
i kissed the princess , and now , they want to keep me
as far away from you as they can .
why would you say that ?
what did he say ?
he said that you had a lot of stuff to work out
and that i should keep my distance .
what , you think that &apos;s about you ?
no , he &apos;s looking out for you , not me .
when i first got here ...
brandon and i , kind of , fell for each other .
that &apos;s why that guy hates my guts .
we fell in love ...
but i needed a family , so we ended it .
i ended it .
that &apos;s probably why mike said that . he was ...
he probably doesn &apos;t want you to get hurt .
i &apos;m not worried about getting my feelings hurt , callie .
besides , there &apos;s one big difference between me and brandon .
i &apos;m never gonna be your brother .
damn it , i &apos;m gonna get a ticket !
其中最大的是爱 出自 《 圣经 》
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a gift for bella from my moms .
but ...
i have to tell you something .
what ? when did this happen ?
just got it . my moms don &apos;t know yet .
i hate parallel parking .
what &apos;s the hurry ? let &apos;s take it for a spin .
well , i can &apos;t drive until i get insurance .
come on , let &apos;s take it around the block one time .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll find a better parking spot .
come on , girl ! let me see your skills .
so , you guys are really okay with this ?
it &apos;s mariana &apos;s choice , not ours .
hey , sweetheart , the service is about to start .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not gonna get baptized .
well , why not , love ?
because ...
i &apos;m not gonna stand up there and say that i believe in a church
that thinks my moms are sinners just for being gay .
i mean , am i a sinner because i &apos;m straight ?
no .
no , i &apos;m not .
so , you &apos;re not gonna be isabella &apos;s godmother ?
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll just keep looking out for her like i do .
i don &apos;t need a title for that .
hey ! have you seen ana ?
what ? what do you mean ?
she said she was going to the restroom ,
but i think she left .
i can &apos;t find her anywhere .
good morning , everyone .
okay . who &apos;s up first ?
we &apos;d like to go first , if that &apos;s okay ?
it &apos;s all yours .
could you drive any slower ?
i can &apos;t afford to get a ticket .
you know you can get aticket
for driving under the speed limit , right ?
no way . really ?
so , you and brandon ...
that &apos;s over , right ?
like , you don &apos;t have a thing for him anymore ?
right .
so , you gonna drive this thing over to rita &apos;s and visit me ?
maybe , if you &apos;re nice .
i &apos;m always nice .
no , no , no , no , no . oh , my god .
we &apos;ve looked everywhere .
she &apos;s not answering her phone either .
i think she &apos;s using again .
is that her ?
no . i &apos;m so sorry , i have to take this .
no , she &apos;s not using again .
i literally just talked to her about it .
well , if it isn &apos;t her pain pills , then it &apos;s something else .
we &apos;ve been down this road before with ana .
well , we just have to do this without her , come on .
do what ? baptize isabella ?
no , you can &apos;t !
this is a family matter , mariana .
you &apos;ve made it quite clear you don &apos;t want to be a part of ours .
sweetheart ...
ana hates me .
that is not what &apos;s happening here .
you &apos;re not responsible for any of this .
okay . yeah . i will be right there .
what ? what is it ? what happened ?
callie and a.j. have been arrested ...
what ?
... for stealing a car .
it &apos;s a fake .
but it &apos;s pink . it &apos;s called a pink slip , right ?
we didn &apos;t exactly know what a title looks like .
no , of course you didn &apos;t . how could you ?
you &apos;re teenagers .
i cannot believe you bought a stolen car .
this is why you don &apos;t do things like this
without talking to your parents .
well , we were gonna tell you .
we just wanted to wait to have enough money for insurance .
are you really looking at your phone right now ?
sorry , i just ...
it &apos;s adriana . ana showed up to the reception . she &apos;s okay .
but do you think we &apos;re gonna get any of the money back ?
i mean , they took the car .
super bold piece , man .
i &apos;m so glad everyone loved your idea .
look , man . sure ...
i was inspired by what you played ,
but prepared piano has been around forever .
it &apos;s not like you invented it .
that is such bull . you know it .
you never would &apos;ve thought of that if it wasn &apos;t for me .
are you buying this ?
i &apos;m switzerland , all right ?
yeah , well , you know what the swiss did in world warⅱ ?
nothing . they just stood by and watched .
i mean , is that really who you wanna be , jin ?
oh , chill out , brandon .
look , there were no war crimes committed .
everyone went home last night ,
and made adjustments based on chris &apos; critiques .
i was in a position to nad up and take a chance .
i &apos;m not gonna apologize for that .
man , that is so weak , it &apos;s actually pathetic .
look who decided to grow a pair .
it &apos;s not my fault you don &apos;t believe in yourself .
is that why you brought me back ?
because you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a real threat ?
well , huge mistake , okay ?
you might &apos;ve gotten away with stealing my idea ,
but we both know that my prepared piece
would &apos;ve blown yours out of the water .
okay ? and if i ever had a doubt
about the fact that i belong here ,
well , it &apos;s gone now , okay ?
so , prepare for some serious competition , my friend ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to own you .
i &apos;ll get it .
what do you wanna do for dinner ?
oh , god . i don &apos;t know . should i run to the store ?
i could do it .
who is it , honey ?
hi , ana .
i , um ...
i think i made a mistake .
i want you to take isabella .
i know you think that i left because i was using ,
but it &apos;s not what happened .
i left because i couldn &apos;t ...
stand up in front of all those people and ...
promise to take care of my baby .
i know it &apos;s horrible , i do , but i just ...
i feel no connection to her .
look at all these parents ,
and they seem so happy .
and that &apos;s not the way it is with me .
i just feel ...
so empty .
this is the way i felt with you and jesus .
and i always thought that it was the drugs .
but i guess ...
i guess i &apos;m just not meant to be a mother .
i think it ...
it sounds like you might be suffering from postpartum depression .
oh , is that her latest excuse ?
this is a very real thing , victor .
women have been known to struggle with it , sometimes for months ,
after having given birth .
please !
why do you do that ?
why do you always assume the worst of her ?
look , i may not have been raised in a church ,
but my moms have always taught me to believe in family ,
and to believe in people ,
and to believe in the best possible version of people .
and that &apos;s what ana needs right now .
for you to have faith in her .
she needs your love and support .
you don &apos;t know what we &apos;ve been through with her .
i do .
she stole money from me . she lied to me .
but i still believe in her .
you can &apos;t just assume she &apos;s using again ,
every time she has a bad day .
i guess we have been guilty of that ,
but you have to understand ...
no excuses . you either believe in her or you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s no secret that i &apos;ve had my problems with the catholic church ,
but one thing that i think is so beautiful ,
that they get really , really right ,
is forgiveness .
absolute forgiveness for ourselves , for others .
i think we all deserve that .
i hope you know , mija ...
we really do want you to succeed .
i just don &apos;t want to feel this way anymore .
so , we &apos;ll get you some help .
what a day , huh ?
sometimes , i wonder if it &apos;s ever gonna get any easier .
i hate that tree .
what ?
i feel horrible saying it , but i hate it .
every day i come down here and i look through this window ,
and i hope ,
and i pray that i will just see a tree ,
instead of a reminder that i lost my baby .
i know i should &apos;ve said this in therapy ,
but i guess i was afraid .
but after speaking with ana ...
about her postpartum , i think , um ...
i think that ...
i &apos;ve been depressed , too .
ever since we lost frankie .
and i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s ...
that it &apos;s postpartum . i just ...
i &apos;m still not over it .
no , it &apos;s not gonna go away , love . that &apos;s not how grief works .
i know you know that .
it &apos;s awful , love , and it &apos;s ...
messy and it sucks ,
and it &apos;s gonna take as long as it takes , and you feel it ,
and you ride it out , okay ? and i &apos;m gonna be here .
i &apos;m gonna be here every second ,
for whatever you need . you hear me ?
one day , you &apos;re gonna look out that window ,
and you &apos;re not gonna feel so sad , i promise .
so , i &apos;m guessing that you &apos;ve heard
about the whole &quot; stolen car &quot; misunderstanding .
so , please let me get callie down here to explain .
hey , callie ! can you come down here , please ?
actually , that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i was reviewing callie &apos;s file
for your final home study
to recommend her adoption to the judge ,
and i have some concerns about callie &apos;s foster brother .
oh , well , a.j. will be moving to a new home
yes .
in a few days .
it &apos;s not a.j. i &apos;m worried about .
it &apos;s brandon .
i &apos;m wondering why you felt the need
to take out a restraining order against your son .
i don &apos;t even know how you got that . that was expunged .
well , even if it was ,
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t make a recommendation on her adoption
until i investigate this further .
and while i am ,
it &apos;s not appropriate for callie to be in your care .
