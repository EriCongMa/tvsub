they &apos;re really great , aren &apos;t they ? i love them .
nice try .
how &apos;d the lecture go ? it went great .
and i didn &apos;t need any jokes or naked chicks either .
that &apos;s great . i &apos;m sorry we weren &apos;t supportive before .
i knew i just had to let the material speak for itself .
everyone &apos;s all , &quot; ross , you have to be funny and sexy . &quot;
well , i proved them wrong !
and now i &apos;m gonna pass the news on to joey and chandler .
that you &apos;re not funny or sexy ?
that &apos;s right !
hey , estelle , listen .. -well , well , well .
joey tribbiani.so you came back , huh ?
they think they can do better , but they all ... come crawling back to estelle .
what are you talking about ?
i never left you . you &apos;ve always been my agent .
really ?
oh , well , no harm no foul .
look , you gotta get me some work . i lost my health insurance .
all right , first thing we gotta do : damage control.-why ?
well , i think ... someone out there may have been bad @-@ mouthing you all over town .
the bastard !
we &apos;re early . the lecture doesn &apos;t end for 15 minutes .
but we could sneak in and watch .
yeah , we could .
hey , look . there &apos;s some kappa kappa deltas . i was a kappa .
hey , sisters .
wow , we really are bitches .
right . so when rigby got his samples back from the laboratory ...
he made a startling discovery .
what he believed to be igneous was , in fact , sedimentary .
imagine his consternation when ..
oh , bloody hell .
so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow .
and i &apos;ll have my health insurance back in no time .
that &apos;s great , but shouldn &apos;t you be on the toilet right now ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
nothing.i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before .
and then i passed out ... and i haven &apos;t been able to stand up since .
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s anything serious .
this sounds like a hernia . go to the doctor.no way .
if i go to the doctor , it &apos;ll be for this thing sticking out of my stomach !
that &apos;s a hernia .
why &apos;d i have to start working out again ?
damn you , 15s !
what the hell are you doing ?
look , i was nervous.you guys had me all worried i was gonna be boring .
i got up there and they were all , like , staring at me .
i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out .
yeah , and not a very good one .
will you , please ... ?
dr. geller ? kurt rathman.i &apos;m a paleontology professor here .
do you have a moment to talk about your lecture ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve got plans with my sister .
monica geller .
right . will you excuse us for one moment ?
what are you doing ?
you can have an accent , but i can &apos;t ?
top of the morning to you , laddies !
would you just please stop ?
yes , yes , bombay is very , very nice this time of year .
hey , will you grab me a cruller ?
sit down !
will you go to the hospital ?
hernia operations cost ... a lot probably , okay ?
besides , it &apos;s getting darker and more painful . that means it &apos;s healing .
look , i &apos;ll loan you the money.just go to the hospital and let &apos;s just get that thing ... pushed back in .
thank you , but it &apos;d take me forever to pay you back.i don &apos;t want that hanging over my head .
besides , when my insurance kicks in ... i can get all the free operations i want .
i &apos;ll probably start with that laser eye surgery .
what &apos;s going on ?
joey &apos;s got a hernia , but it &apos;s nothing a little laser eye surgery won &apos;t fix .
i &apos;m telling you , if i put my hand on my stomach ... it doesn &apos;t hurt that bad .
hey , maybe you &apos;ll die !
chandler , i &apos;m scared .
no , we can go together .
just don &apos;t wait too long , because i &apos;m out of here sometime before friday .
but i don &apos;t want to die .
it &apos;ll be fun . we &apos;ll come back and haunt these guys !
wait . could i come back and haunt monica and rachel when they &apos;re in the shower ?
that &apos;s my girlfriend .
hey , i &apos;m dead !
give me them !
no , they are mine !
you stole them from me !
you stole them from me !
give me them !
just wanna each take one ?
yeah , that seems fair . we never use them .
look , i really need some help , okay ?
why did i have to speak in a british accent ?
what do i do ? why don &apos;t you call mummy and daddy ?
i &apos;m serious ! someone &apos;s gonna find out and then they &apos;re never gonna offer me a job .
why don &apos;t you phase it out ? yeah , phase the accent out.people will think you &apos;re adjusting to life in america .
come on . no one will even notice.they &apos;re probably not even listening to you .
they &apos;re not listening to me ? of course they &apos;re listening to you.everybody listens to you .
monica , do you think i should try this phasing @-@ out thing ?
i think you look fine .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
hey , timmy.i &apos;ve got a surprise for you .
hold it . i &apos;m sorry.the surprise is a new swing set .
if you could play it less intense.oh , yeah . sure , no problem.just hold on one second .

no , he &apos;s not . can i take a message ?
yes , this is russell , ross &apos; divorce lawyer .
since i haven &apos;t heard from him , i assume he &apos;s giving the marriage a try .
ross got married again ?
all right , keep going . we are phasing the accent out.phasing it out .
&quot; so without retesting their results in the laboratory ...
the team would never have identified ...
the initial errors in their carbon dating ... analysis . &quot;
were there any questions at this point ?
what &apos;s happening to your accent ?
come again ? what &apos;s this nonsense ?
all right . i &apos;m not english.i &apos;m from long lsland .
i was really nervous , and the accent ... just came out.i &apos;m sorry .
so if we could just get back to the lecture .
were there any questions ?
about paleontology ?
i was just trying to make a good first impression.obviously , i screwed up .
but what you guys think of me is important because i &apos;m hoping to get a permanent job here .
so if you &apos;d just give me another chance to make a good impression ..
ross ! are you crazy ? i am still your wife ?
were you just never gonna tell me ? what the hell is wrong with you ?
i could just kill you !
well , hello , rachel !
you &apos;ve really done this before ?
you just take a big , big swing , okay ? now , don &apos;t hold back .
what are you doing ? we &apos;re just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back .
