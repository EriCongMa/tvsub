it &apos;s my chance to give something back ...
... to the acting community .
you &apos;re probably not allowed to sleep with your students .
i know .
i don &apos;t know , monica . it feels funny just being here .
if you buy a bed from janice &apos;s ex @-@ husband ...
... it &apos;s like betraying chandler .
not at these prices !
you know , in england this car would be on the other side of the store .
come here .
this is my new bed !
you gotta feel this bad boy !
monica , it still feels so weird , you know ?

all right , take this bed . you can make other friends .
good evening .
i am mr. tribbiani .
and i will be teaching acting for soap operas .
unfortunately , tonight will be my only class ...

so do we get our deposit back ?
that was supposed to be an example of acting for soap operas .
then why are you only teaching tonight ?
l &apos;m not . look , why don &apos;t we get straight to the lesson , okay ?
now ...
... on my first day as dr. drake ramoray on days of our lives ...
... i learned one of the most important things in soap opera acting ...
... is reacting .
this does not mean acting again .
it means you don &apos;t have a line , but someone else just did .
and it goes something like this .
thanks . thanks a lot .
by the way , before i forget . to work in soap operas ...
... some of you will have to become more attractive .
all right , moving right along ....
how was teaching last night ?
great ! you get to say stuff like ...

what happened to the library ?
there never was a library .
i mean , there are libraries . it &apos;s just ...
... that i &apos;ve never worked at one .
you know what &apos;s really good here ? the lobster .

waiter .
we will have two lobsters and a menu .
so , dr. greene , how &apos;s the old boat ?
they found rust . do you know what rust does to a boat ?

i want to say good night to the levines before we go .
honey , stop . it &apos;s not that bad .
your dad must have added wrong . he only tipped 4 % .
yeah . that &apos;s daddy .
&quot; that &apos;s daddy &quot; ? doesn &apos;t it bother you ? you &apos;re a waitress .
yes , it bothers me .
if he was a regular at the coffee house , i &apos;d be serving him sneezers .
so ?
so , ross ...
... i &apos;ve bugged him about this a million times . he won &apos;t change .
do you really serve people sneezers ?
well , i don &apos;t .
all right , kids . ready ?
thanks again , dr. greene .
wait , i think i forgot my receipt .
you don &apos;t need that .
why not ?
the carbon . it &apos;s messy . i mean , gets on your fingers and causes ...
... night blindness .
what is this ?
who put a 20 down here ?
oh , yeah , that would be me .
i have a problem .
i tip way too much . way too much .
it &apos;s a sickness , really .
yeah , it is .
we have to do something about that .
excuse me .
you think i &apos;m cheap ?
he didn &apos;t mean anything by that . he really didn &apos;t .
nothing i do means anything . really .
this is nice . i pay $ 200 for dinner .
you put down $ 20 and you come out looking like mr. big shot .
you really want to be mr. big shot ? here .
i &apos;ll tell you what . you pay the whole bill , mr. big shot . all right ?
well , &quot; mr. big shot &quot; is better than &quot; wet @-@ head . &quot;
okay , some tricks of the trade .
now , i &apos;ve never been able to cry as an actor ...
... so if i have to cry ...
... i cut a hole in my pocket ...
... take a pair of tweezers ...
... and just start pulling .
or let &apos;s say i want to convey ...
... that i &apos;ve just done something evil .
that would be your basic i &apos;ve @-@ got @-@ a- fish @-@ hook @-@ in @-@ my @-@ eyebrow @-@ and @-@ l @-@ like @-@ it .
let &apos;s say i &apos;ve just gotten bad news .
well , all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13 .
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
great soap opera acting tonight , everybody .
class dismissed .
hey , mr. trib .
guess what ? i got an audition !
one of my students got an audition . i &apos;m so proud !
i was wondering if you &apos;d coach me for it .
you bet ! what &apos;s the part ?
oh , it &apos;s great !
it &apos;s a role on all my children . nick the boxer .
you had to do it.you couldn &apos;t leave it alone .
four percent , okay ? i tip more than that when there &apos;s a bug in my food .
tonight was about the two of you getting along .
would you just see my chiropractor already ?
i &apos;m gonna go to a doctor who went to medical school in a mini @-@ mall .
hey , pheebs . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m freaking out !
monica trusted me with something and she shouldn &apos;t have !
i haven &apos;t lived here in a while , so i have to ask you .
does monica still turn the lights on in her room ?
i am so dead !
look , here &apos;s the bottom line .
this is fixable if we act fast , okay ?
i &apos;ll invite him to brunch tomorrow , and you can make nice .
honey , i have tried to make nice . it doesn &apos;t work .
look , i realize my father is difficult .
but that &apos;s why you have got to be the bigger man here .
sweetie , i could be the bigger man . i could be the biggest man .
i could be a huge , giant man , and it still wouldn &apos;t make a difference .
except i could pick your father up and say , &quot; like me ! like me , tiny doctor ! &quot;
can &apos;t you just try it one more time ? for me ? for me ?
one brunch is not gonna solve anything .
face it . we &apos;re never gonna get along .
well , you are just going to have to .
i &apos;ve already got a mother and father who cannot stay in the same room .
i don &apos;t want to have a separate room for you too !
i &apos;ll get the bagels .
what &apos;s this ?
isn &apos;t it cool ?
this is not the bed i ordered .
i know ! you must have won a contest or something .
why is this car in my bedroom ?
i &apos;m sorry . i wasn &apos;t looking ...
... and the store won &apos;t take it back , because you signed for it .
when did i sign for it ?
when i was you .
it &apos;s all joey &apos;s fault , because he left his nose open !
did you make brownies today ?
iknock , knock !
quick ! take off your dress . he won &apos;t notice the bed .
i &apos;m going for sushi . does anybody want ?
somebody missed the off @-@ ramp !
it &apos;s monica &apos;s bed . what ?
it &apos;s a racecar !
this has always been monica &apos;s bed . you just noticed ?
how self @-@ involved are you ?
if this bed isn &apos;t new , then how come there &apos;s plastic on the mattress ?
sometimes i have bad dreams .
look ...
... i just saw my best friend &apos;s brain smeared across the canvas .
it &apos;s not gonna be me .
not me .
that was good .
that was
tweezers ?
that was really good .
thanks .

oh , my god .
argue with that .
my right leg is two inches shorter !
come on , you &apos;re just tilting !
her legs are fine .
i know that .
so why do you let her go to him ?
&quot; let her &quot; ?
she doesn &apos;t listen to me about renter &apos;s insurance , either .
wait a minute . you don &apos;t have renter &apos;s insurance ?
how you gonna run after a thief , with one leg shorter than the other ?
would you like some juice ?
i &apos;d love some juice .
this is going so well ! did you see us ? did you see ?
yeah , honey . i was standing right there .
why don &apos;t you tell him about my mole ?
excellent !
there will come a time in each of your careers ...
... when you &apos;ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor .
i had such an opportunity in the recent present .
and i &apos;m ashamed to say ...
... that i took it .
i advised a fellow actor to play a role ...
... homosexually .
we both auditioned for the part ...
... and as it turned out ...
... they ....
they liked the stupid &quot; gay &quot; thing and cast him .
and now ...
... he &apos;s got a two @-@ year contract ...
... opposite susan lucci ...
... the first lady of daytime television .
and me ?
me , i &apos;m stuck here teaching a bunch of people ...
... most of whom are too ugly to even be on tv .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
may i help you ?
yes , hi .
i &apos;m the lady who got stuck with the racecar bed .
look , it &apos;s like i told you . there &apos;s nothing i can do .
you signed for it . &quot; monica felula geller . &quot;
all right , we wanna see the king .
nobody sees the king .
okay . i &apos;m talking to the king .
hey , you can &apos;t go back there !
oh , my god .
hey , watch it , lady !
hey , good @-@ looking .
all right , i &apos;ll leave .
