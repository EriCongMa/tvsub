commander mcgarrett ?
this is about my sister , isn &apos;t it ?
she disabled a smoke detector on board in the bathroom ,
which is a federal offense .
so we arrested her as soon as she landed .
great .
jail ? are you serious ?
it was just a cigarette !
okay , officer , i think we ... we &apos;re good now .
steve mcgarrett , from the governor &apos;s task force .
you can release her into my custody .
let me check with my supervisor .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i messed up .
i missed you at dad &apos;s funeral , mare .
yeah , well , something came up .
you know the last time i saw you was at mom &apos;s funeral ?
i guess that &apos;s the way we do our family reunions .
&apos;cause i was thinking it could &apos;ve been cool
to have a picnic in between , or something , you know ?
a picnic ?
yeah .
a picnic .
something that , i don &apos;t know , normal families do ?
how did you say you were injured , again ?
well , originally , uh ...
playing high school baseball ,
but , uh , it hasn &apos;t bothered me in a really long time .
anything traumatic recently , with the knee ?
yeah , actually . i got a new partner .
i was thinking more about a physical injury .
no , no , this @-@ this guy is like a physical injury , doc .
ten minutes after meeting him ,
i get shot and blasted backwards through a window , okay ?
a few hours after that ,
he drives a car-- not joking--
onto the deck of a chinese freighter ship .
and , yes , i was in it .
the car , not the ship .
he drove a car onto a boat ?
yeah . he &apos;s an animal .
and i sorta get the feeling that he &apos;s just getting warmed up .
ouch .
yeah .
so , how do i fix it ?
you get a new partner .
yeah , i &apos;d like that , but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna happen .
i &apos;m seeing a slight tear on the acl .
so , you &apos;re going to have to stay off that knee
for a couple of weeks , physical therapy ,
and i &apos;ll put you on some anti @-@ inflammatories .
can i get those , uh , to go ? please ?
i &apos;ll be back . hey , stay .
i &apos;m not a dog .
stay .
what happened to you ?
oh . uh , i blame you .
i tore my acl somewhere in the last few weeks ,
all the fun we &apos;ve been having together .
all right . well , once you &apos;re done bitching about
your boo @-@ boo , i &apos;d love to know what &apos;s going on here .
we got an escaped prisoner ,
three dead guards .
department of public safety &apos;s trying to figure out
what the hell happened ,
where &apos;s chin and kono ?
inside , getting background .
is that your sister in the car ?
yeah , i just came straight from the airport .
you realize if she were a dog , you could get a ticket
for leaving her in the car like that ?
can we focus , please ?
why do you have aneurism @-@ face ?
i don &apos;t have aneurism @-@ face .
she gave you aneurism @-@ face ?
how many times in a row can you ask me the same question ?
&quot; you gotta seek first to understand , then to be understood . &quot;
it &apos;s one of seven principles of all successful people .
i will literally pay you cash to stop talking , okay ?
excuse me , officer ?
my blue pickup is just around the corner .
there &apos;s a woman sitting it in .
it &apos;s my sister ; i &apos;m putting her in your custody , okay ?
get her some food ,
take her back to my office ,
don &apos;t take your eyes off her until i get there , you got it ?
yes , sir .
thank you .
you happy ?
fugitive &apos;s name is walton dawkins .
he &apos;s originally from the mainland ,
but he did ten years at the allen correctional facility
in cleveland for multiple home invasions .
apparently our guy likes hitting families with big money .
then he violated his parole by coming to hawaii six years ago .
my guess is it wasn &apos;t for the surf .
dawkins killed a young couple during one of his burglaries .
but get this : according to the warden ,
he &apos;s been a model prisoner up until now .
so what changed ?
hey , guards !
we need help in here !
all right , so right before the inmate collapsed ,
he was complaining of shortness of breath , pain in his arm .
textbook signs of cardiac arrest .
he &apos;s a little young to be dropping dead
of a heart attack , don &apos;t you think ?
yeah .
not if he was poisoned .
we found this stuff in dawkins &apos; cell .
nutmeg .
oh , yeah , they got the prison bake sale coming up .
hang on a second .
you can extract myristicin from nutmeg .
it &apos;s an organic compound ,
has psychoactive properties , it works like a drug ,
and in large enough doses , it &apos;s lethal and fast @-@ acting .
so dawkins poisons an inmate as a distraction ,
shoots a few guards ,
then walks out the door wearing one of their uniforms .
yeah , in broad daylight ?
i mean , it feels like a lot of unnecessary exposure
for someone trying to sneak out the door .
price of freedom ?
or maybe he didn &apos;t think he had time to dig a tunnel .
what else we got ?
one of the maintenance guys reported his car stolen
from the parking lot . we got hpd a description .
well , let &apos;s assume dawkins knows that , too ,
so he &apos;s going to abandon that car .
we &apos;ll find it . maybe it &apos;ll tell us where he &apos;s going .
hey , watch this .
keep your eyes on the guard .
look at his holster .
safety strap &apos;s unfastened .
wait a minute .
what the hell &apos;s he doing with a gun , anyway ?
weapons are for towers , gates , and transports only .
maybe it was a rookie mistake .
no , not a rookie mistake .
he &apos;s in on it , he wanted dawkins to have that gun .
so what &apos;s in it for the guard ?
whatever it is , it was worth putting an armed
and dangerous fugitive back on the streets .
billy omana , right ?
yeah .
yeah , put those on .
excuse me ?
uh , he said put them on .
who the hell you guys think you are ?
what did dawkins offer you
to help him escape from prison today ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
billy , so help me god ,
you answer incorrectly one more time ,
i &apos;m gonna put those scrubs on you myself
and then drop you in general population .
how long you think you &apos;ll last there ?
you can &apos;t do that .
this here says i can .
dawkins said that if i helped him , he &apos;d give me 50 grand .
and you believed him ?
he arranged for $ 10,000 to be wired into my account .
he told me it was everything he had .
i &apos;d get the rest as soon as he got out .
where &apos;d he say the rest of the money was coming from ?
i don &apos;t know .
all he told me was that there was a lot of it
waiting for him on the outside , but in order to get it ,
he needed to get out today .
i &apos;m detective williams ; this is commander mcgarrett .
we hear you and walton dawkins were neighbors .
yeah , four and a half years .
warden says you guys used to be pretty tight .
well , in the non @-@ biblical sense , if you dig what i &apos;m saying .
so what happened ?
why the beef ?
i didn &apos;t appreciate him trying to gut me with a shiv last week .
he said i was asking too many questions .
questions have anything to do with why he bounced today ?
you know , it &apos;s possible i may have some pertinent information ,
but , uh , you gonna have to play me for it .
play you ?
that &apos;s right .
you win-- i tell you everything i know .
what &apos;s to stop me taking that basketball
and beating it out of you ?
bring it .
they got better food at the hospital anyway .
what the hell you got to threaten me with , man ?
more lockup time ?
okay .
we might be able to help you .
shave some time off your sentence ?
i &apos;m doing double life , gimp .
excuse me ?
you got a busted ear , too , man ?
i &apos;m on permanent vacation , no parole .
you could shave 10 years off my time ,
but i ain &apos;t never getting out .
so it &apos;s either b @-@ ball
with tall , dark and uptight here ,
or nothing .
i got all the time in the world .
what do you get if we lose ?
i get the pleasure of beating a cop &apos;s ass
in front of the whole yard .
oh , yeah , play basketball .
it &apos;s not like we have a killer to catch , or anything .
the clock &apos;s ticking . he &apos;s our best lead .
all right , game &apos;s to 21 .
ten .
man &apos;s in a hurry .
okay , since you &apos;re a guest in my house ,
you take it in .
i got a tip .
so you know , the other guy putting
the ball in the hoop is @-@ is bad .
danno , shut up , all right ?
please , do me a favor and don &apos;t call me danno , huh ?
yo , how long you two been married ?
come on . play ball .
okay , all right , time @-@ out .
time @-@ out . my time .
you , uh , never played basketball , have you ?
no , i &apos;ve played once or twice .
yeah ? yeah , i mean , i can see that .
it looked like i was watching lebron ,
and maybe he &apos;s just this much better .
you know what ? football was my sport , okay ? yeah ?
now you tell me that ?
hey , you ready to quit ?
no . - yes . - which one is it ?
can you just give me a second , please ? can i have some space ?
all right , listen to me .
you &apos;re not gonna outshoot him , so out @-@ d him , all right ?
play it like it &apos;s football .
put a body on him , steal the ball away from him
and put it in the hoop , huh ?
what &apos;s he gonna do , call a foul ?
we &apos;re in jail .
all right , i can do that .
that &apos;s game .
let &apos;s have it , man .
all right , badge , here it is .
a couple weeks ago
we &apos;re in rec watching some tube .
samoan dude walks by , he tries to change the channel .
dawkins almost throws down right there .
you should have seen him . his eyes were @-@ were crazy .
just &apos; cause he changed the channel ?
no , no , bro , wasn &apos;t that .
it was something on tv that made him go crazy .
what was he watching ?
dana , your luxury vacation includes first @-@ class airfare ,
seven nights at the kohiko hotel
all @-@ access vip passes
to the annual festival of the islands ,
which kicks off two weeks from now .
and since you &apos;ll need a little spending money
while shopping on beautiful kalakaua avenue ,
we &apos;re throwing in $ 1 million !
she &apos;s the reason that dawkins broke out of prison ?
she just won a million dollars and a trip to hawaii .
okay , but why her ? like , there &apos;s not enough
rich people on this island ?
she &apos;s away from home , she &apos;s out of her element .
maybe dawkins sees her as an easy target .
whatever . i need everything on dana .
okay ? travel itineraries , flights , car rental .
hey , guess what ?
i &apos;ve done this before , but thank you .
that &apos;s it .
it matches the description of the car dawkins stole .
five @-@ o. we &apos;ll take it from here .
what are you doing ?
looking for cash .
it &apos;s what dawkins would have done .
empty .
says maybe he used whatever he found
to buy something .
food or water ?
no , dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now .
if he wants to get off the island ,
the first thing he needs to do is change his appearance .
coming in ?
it &apos;s the men &apos;s room .
it &apos;s the luxury of carrying a badge , kid--
you can go anywhere .
lemonade mixed in mayo .
it &apos;s an old prison trick for dyeing hair .
seriously ?
looks like our man &apos;s a blonde now .
purchases were made at an abc store just up the street .
15 minutes ago .
factor in the time for a dye job ,
he couldn &apos;t have made it very far .
he could still be around here .
you see that ?
excuse me , sir .
every time i come across ...
sir ?
i was ...
gotta call you back .
hey , bro , where did you get the uniform ?
traded for it .
not really my style ,
but the guy threw in a phone , too .
pretty sweet deal , huh ?
we &apos;re gonna need that phone .
what are you gonna trade for it ?
how about a pair of handcuffs ?
yes , thank you very much . okay .
so dana thorpe and her fiance , craig ellers ,
landed at honolulu international earlier this morning .
just checked into a hotel ten minutes ago .
chin .
hey , hpd found the car .
dawkins abandoned it about 15 minutes ago ,
parking lot kaka &apos;ako beach park .
got it .
that &apos;s three blocks away from where craig and dana are staying .
oh , my ...
i couldn &apos;t stand it .
oh , my god , me either .
never has there been a longer line
in the history of check @-@ in lines .
unzip me .
mmm ! god , you are beautiful .
what &apos;s it like being so beautiful ?
clear !
clear !
oh , no ! no , no , no !
dawkins is gone , so is craig .
you &apos;re gonna be okay . we &apos;re gonna get you to a hospital , okay ?
craig ...
we &apos;re gonna find craig .
this is detective kelly , five @-@ o.
we need an ambulance , kohiko hotel .
come on , come on , come on .
on the way .
she &apos;s not breathing .
come on ! come on ! come on !
hang in there , dana , okay ?
hang in there .
it &apos;s all gonna be okay .
we &apos;re gonna find craig , okay ?
we &apos;ll find craig .
hey , how is she ?
she &apos;s in surgery . didn &apos;t give me anything on the way .
what do we got ?
hotel surveillance camera picked this up right after the attack .
doesn &apos;t add up .
why take craig and leave dana ? she won the money .
but they &apos;re engaged , so maybe they have joint bank accounts .
yeah , or maybe he wants craig for something else .
you know what ? freeze their accounts .
i want thorough backgrounds on dawkins , craig and dana .
run their names through ncic .
chin , what about the phone you found ?
dawkins got it from the car he stole at the prison ,
but the call history was erased ,
so i figured he must have made some phone calls .
reached out to the phone company , and sure enough ,
two calls were made right after the escape .
first one went to a local woman
named sofia archuleta .
archuleta . that &apos;s dawkins &apos; girlfriend .
warden said she &apos;s a regular visitor .
all right , so she &apos;s the first one he &apos;s gonna hook up
with for help . what about the other call ?
that one was made to a local lightweight
ex @-@ con by the name of makani huku .
they spoke for three minutes .
kono , follow up on the phone call with makani .
find out what they were talking about .
chin , pull dawkins &apos; jacket .
see if we can find any links on dana and craig .
easy .
we need to get an address for sofia .
i &apos;ll get it .
you should change your shirt . you look like an animal .
you should go apologize to your sister , too .
she &apos;s been sitting there for five hours .
thanks . i &apos;ll take it from here .
mary , i &apos;m sorry .
you okay ?
yeah .
so is this your big &quot; welcome to hawaii &quot; plan ?
pin me to some guy with a badge ?
mary , i &apos;m trying to keep you out of jail .
come here .
what are you laughing at ?
punk .
like seven years old .
i don &apos;t get it , mare .
i mean , why come back here ?
you already missed the funeral .
do you think i feel good about not being there ?
truthfully ? i don &apos;t know .
i can &apos;t tell .
i mean , we were invisible to that man .
i would have taken anything from him , even disappointment ,
&apos;cause at least it would have been something .
listen , mare , i know this is really hard for you to accept , okay ?
but dad loved us .
he just didn &apos;t know how to show it , i guess .
i got that address on sofia archuleta .
mary , right ?
sis , meet danno .
danny williams .
what &apos;s up ?
not much .
a tie ? seriously ?
yeah , what is it with you people and ties ?
we &apos;re in hawaii .
wow . in stereo . it &apos;s great . thanks . you ready to go ?
hey , perfect timing .
how &apos;s it , haole ?
shamu .
what &apos;s with the stick ?
you got slammed in a cruncher ?
um , i don &apos;t know what that means .
sand facial . you ate a big one , huh ?
there was no surfing accident .
he , uh , he busted his knee getting out of bed .
how white can you get ?
pretty white .
who &apos;s this ?
this is my sister , mary .
mary , meet kamekona .
hey .
this is the reason i called you .
i want a friendly face to make sure she stays put .
oh , come on .
you want me to babysit your little sister ?
correct .
shoots . small kine .
all right , she doesn &apos;t leave this office , you understand ?
whoa , whoa , whoa . hold on .
seriously ? what if i have to use a bathroom ?
don &apos;t spill .
oh , my god .
so inappropriate .
can you quit staring at me like i &apos;m a hot fudge sundae ?
got a boyfriend , little sis ?
you got a girlfriend ?
i did ,
but we broke up .
tell me about it .
maybe i can help you get back with her .
boss , i &apos;m at makani &apos;s address .
when i badged him , he tried to rabbit .
didn &apos;t get real far .
what did he tell you about dawkins ?
makani runs a fake i.d. mill out of the back of his shop .
dawkins was in here about an hour ago .
he picked up a driver &apos;s license and a passport ,
under the name carl isner .
update hpd on the new alias ,
and make sure homeland security adds it to the no @-@ fly list .
do you always have to walk so fast ?
that &apos;s dawkins &apos; girlfriend .
oh , you know , um , you sister-- she wasn &apos;t what i expected .
i mean , aside from her hereditary aversion to neckwear ,
she seemed pretty cool .
what are you saying , i &apos;m not cool ?
well , in certain situations ,
like when you &apos;ve got a gun pointed in your face ,
or trying to decide to cut the blue wire or the red wire ,
you &apos;re good but , you know ,
human interaction--
mammal @-@ to @-@ mammal--
room for improvement .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
thank you , dr. phil .
can i get you guys something ?
yeah . walton dawkins .
excuse me ?
well , yeah , first , walton dawkins ,
but then i would love some blueberry pancakes .
i love pancakes in the afternoon .
you like pancakes , sofia ?
i like pancakes .
you do ?
yeah .
you seem more like a &quot; napalm in the morning &quot; kind of guy .
that , too , but ...
well , i wasn &apos;t talking to you , i was talking to sofia .
i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s a broad question .
okay , who the hell are you guys ?
sofia ,
we know that you spoke to dawkins this morning ,
and you seem like a reasonable , nice lady ,
who &apos;s just made some bad relationship decisions--
which i can totally relate to--
so we &apos;re gonna give you a break .
yeah , i mean , this could really only go two ways .
the first is , you sit down
and you tell us what we want to know ,
then you finish your shift and you go home .
the second is that we arrest you
in front of all your regular customers
and you lose your job .
and i gotta get my pancakes to go .
right . and because you &apos;ve been uncooperative
and helped a man who killed three people today ,
you go to jail for aiding and abetting a fugitive .
why don &apos;t you take a seat ?
you recognize this couple ?
no . who are they ?
they &apos;re two tourists that your boyfriend attacked today--
dana thorpe and craig ellers .
they &apos;re staying at the kohiko .
how do you know that ?
i have a friend who works there .
last time i went to see walton ,
he asked me to call her ,
and find out when those two were scheduled to check in .
that information got dana shot .
look , he didn &apos;t say anything about hurting them , okay ?
he just wanted to know when they were coming to hawaii .
why ?
okay , sofia ,
dawkins has this guy craig right now ,
and he &apos;s gonna kill him , all right ?
and the only way we can prevent that is
if you tell us exactly
what dawkins said to you on the phone this morning .
he said something about a big payday ...
then asked me for my car .
dawkins is driving a 2010 silver chevy malibu .
car &apos;s got a vehicle recovery system .
can you track it ?
no problem .
ready !
vin number &apos;s two @-@ niner @-@ whisky
niner @-@ alpha @-@ alpha @-@ seven @-@ niner
two @-@ eight @-@ one .
give me ten minutes .
hey , i pulled dawkins &apos; jacket .
you guys gotta see this .
this guy &apos;s rap sheet reads like a grocery list he &apos;s checking off .
in boston , he &apos;s jacking cars ,
in new york , he &apos;s robbing atms , and then he graduates
to full @-@ on bank robberies in cleveland .
cops there suspect him of murdering his stickup partner ,
a guy by the name of paul stark .
the $ 5 million they stole together-- never found .
look familiar ?
that &apos;s craig .
so no wonder he doesn &apos;t take dana .
he doesn &apos;t care about her prize money ,
he wants the five million he stole with paul , or craig .
kono .
i got him .
they just parked outside pacific rim bank .
i watched you die .
you watched me pass out .
doctors said the bullet you put in me ...
missed my vital organs .
well , uh , lucky me , &apos; cause , uh ,
now i get to collect the money that you hid from me , paul .
or , sorry , what are you calling yourself now-- craig ?
but you know ...
i couldn &apos;t believe
when i saw you on that game show .
i thought i was losing my mind , but there you were ,
in the flesh ...
a second chance at getting what &apos;s mine .
no , the money belonged to us .
i figured you would double @-@ cross me , so i moved it .
smart boy .
but , uh ,
you &apos;re not so smart right now .
you listen to me .
i know about that swiss bank account
where you moved my money to .
now ... here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
you &apos;re gonna go in that bank ,
and you &apos;re gonna wire the money to yourself ,
and you &apos;re gonna get it out in cash .
you can &apos;t just walk into a bank
and take out $ 4 million .
you just go in there ,
and you get me what &apos;s mine .
all right .
let &apos;s go .
i said no cops .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
go , go , go !
five @-@ o requesting backup-- pacific rim bank .
restaurant row . shots fired .
everybody out !
you the manager ? show me the back door .
let &apos;s go !
chin .
i see him .
okay .
hey ... where is he ?
he took my car !
kono !
i &apos;m on it .
shoulder went through and through .
dana ...
the surgeons are working on her now . listen to me .
did dawkins say where he was going after the bank ?
i saw ... i saw a passport .
now that he has his money , he &apos;s gonna disappear .
damn it .
dawkins was on his way to the airport , saw our checkpoint
and made a u @-@ turn .
he &apos;s in the h3 tunnel , headed into halawa valley . uh @-@ oh .
uh @-@ oh , what ?
we &apos;re about to lose traffic cam coverage
in about two seconds .
he &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s no other cameras on that road .
all right .
one second .
why , hello there , sailor .
cath , i need your help .
i &apos;m pursuing a suspect in a black mercedes .
he &apos;s headed west into the halawa valley .
can you give me a visual ?
you want me to access an ikon reconnaissance satellite
for your car chase ?
this guy &apos;s killed three people already today .
yeah , look , this could raise some flags .
classify it as an nsa request from a black ops drop box .
okay ? come on , cath , i need this .
you know , you &apos;re like the good @-@ looking guy
from high school , who knows how cute he is
and just won &apos;t take no for an answer .
all right , i got your black mercedes .
i &apos;m sending you the grid coordinates and imagery now .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
next leave , beers are on me . okay ?
oh , you are not getting off that easy .
you got her to use a military recon satellite ,
and then you made a date ?
i &apos;m a multitasker .
impressive .
