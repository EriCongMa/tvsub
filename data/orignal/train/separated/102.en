第五季第八集
This is no longer a dream. This is reality.
Three months from now, we are opening offices in New York.
I want to say something.
Not now, Howard.
We are growing.
Share that with your clients.
The era of constriction is over.
Now, a new era
needs new branding.
"L.G."
Own those letters.
No one says "Lockhart/Gardner" anymore.
It's "L.G."
I'll be right back.
Who's thinking of leaving?
Sonya Rucker. The Wabash fund.
Chumhum?
No. Not yet.
Sonya Rucker and Wabash are leaving Florrick-Agos.
Their infrastructure?
Bad.
Florrick-Agos barely exists. We've been working out of
Alicia's apartment for the last two weeks.
That's why I'm back here.
Did the clients know?
No.
We either met at their offices or over lunch.
But they are moving into new offices today.
What offices? T-shirt factory on grand.
Really?
It's all we could...
They could afford.
$20 a square foot.
The connections with the Governor aren't helping Alicia?
Mm, they're hurting her.
I lost a client because of all the ethical issues
from the Governor's Office.
Thank you, Anthony.
What a putz.
We should've tried to get Carey Zepps.
I'll take Rucker.
Will, you take the Wabash.
I'll be right back.
How's your course going?
When driving in fog, you should use your...?
Low beams.
That's not true, is it?
It is.
I wrote fog lights.
Why are they called fog lights if they're not for fog?
To trick you.
How long do you need my wi-fi for?
A few hours.
Want me gone?
Nope. Stay as long as you want.
So, do we have a Yoko Ono problem here?
Mr. Lee, she's still waiting.
Tell her to come back tomorrow. Tell her...
all the partners are busy.
I'm not busy. Who is it?
A walk-in. Not much money.
She says she used to work here.
I'll take care of it.
So, uh,
you used to work here, Ms. Flores?
I did. Two years ago. As an intern.
Now you want to come back?
No.
That was a joke.
Breaking the ice.
So... how can we help you?
A friend of mine has been swept up in a raid of businesses
employing undocumented workers.
They've threatened to deport him back to Mexico
unless he agrees to a snitch visa...
Oh, so you're from Mexico?
No.
I love Mexico.
I was down there in the '60s.
Puerto Vallarta.
God, the drinks they had.
You know, the ones. The-the, um...
The ones, um...
What are they called?
I have no idea.
And the women.
In those dresses.
Those short dresses.
Could you call Alicia Florrick for me, please?
A-actually, Alicia doesn't work here anymore.
She doesn't?
Where is she?
Well, here it is.
The furniture should be arriving in a few hours.
Do we have phones, at least?
Not until tomorrow.
We'll have to work from cells.
We can't meet with Chumhum here.
Eh, we need to polish the floors.
You know, make it look like a hip start-up.
Open floor plan. No walls.
It'll take us a week.
We can do this.
And when did this happen?
Well, right now. The prosecutor's mid-trial
and he's pressuring Tomas
to sign the snitch visa before noon.
I told Tomas to wait till he spoke to a lawyer.
That's your friend? Tomas?
Yes. Tomas Ruiz.
I knew him in school.
And who does this prosecutor want him to testify against?
Lalo Hierra.
Yes, I know.
It's worrisome.
Okay, let me talk to my partners.
We're just... starting out.
Yes, I can see that.
Are these just temporary?
They're gonna look great.
Just give us a week.
It's just consultation on a visa, but she needs me now.
Is it worth our time?
I'm not sure this guy can pay.
He's an undocumented immigrant. He owns a body shop.
Well, we can't be doing pro bono.
No, no, no. We should do it.
Why?
Natalie Flores works for a New York lobbyist named Joe Pallotta.
He controls $90 million in client billing.
He can direct Chicago work our way.
Checked online.
Okay. I'll take it.
Hey, our first new client.
All right. Yes.
Who was the last person hired, the last salaried person?
Why?
I was talking to Clarke Hayden.
We need to, uh, make cuts to our payroll.
Carey, we made a commitment to our employees.
Yes,
and that commitment means nothing if we go under.
Who was the last person?
Ah. It was Robyn, wasn't it?
We can't let her go. We'll have no investigator.
And how much have we investigated in the last two weeks?
Look, it's just for a few months. I'll talk to her.
No, I will.
But not until Friday.
I need your answer now, Mr. Ruiz.
I've been in this country for nine years, sir.
Our shop pays social security and payroll tax.
Yes, and you're undocumented.
Look, it's very simple.
Lalo Hierra used your shop
to meet with the head of the Latin Gangsters.
You testify to that fact and what you heard them say,
and you won't be deported.
Excuse me. Could you step outside?
Could I... Who are you?
Alicia Florrick, Mr. Ruiz's attorney.
Who are you?
Mr. Ruiz,
it is your right to have an attorney present, but I must warn you...
If you want to warn anyone, warn me.
...Any delay in signing this Snitch Visa
means the offer could go away.
The offer's not going away.
You need him more than he needs you.
Now, whom am I addressing?
Karl Dolan. U.S. Attorney.
She's gonna get you deported, Tomas...
Please step outside, AUSA Dolan. Right now.
No, that's it.
I'm conferring with my client.
Step outside.
Tomas, Elena,
This is one of the lawyers I was talking to you about.
Alicia Florrick.
I'd like you to consider all the possibilities before you sign.
I know. Lalo is dangerous and I'll be testifying against him,
But... I...
Can't be without Elena.
I can't be deported.
That will truly kill me.
He'll do it.
Praise God.
But he wants 24-hour protection for his family and himself.
That's already in the visa.
No, it was promised, but it's not in the visa.
Also, he wants a promise not to deport his wife and his girls.
You didn't need to come.
I would've offered all that.
Good. So put it in the visa,
and we'll be ready for court.
Six bodies were found hanging from a bridge outside the city.
Five more were decapitated.
And did anyone
take responsibility for the execution?
There was a bullet left at the scene,
A single .357 Magnum shell
with the letters "L.C." painted on it.
"L.C."?
Short for "El culebra."
The snake.
And is there someone in the cartel who goes by that nickname?
Yes. The defendant,
Lalo hierra. Uh, thank you, agent Thorburn.
Just a... Uh, actually, nothing further, Your Honor.
We would request a short recess
to prepare a new name that we'd like to add to the witness list.
Granted. We'll break for lunch.
Be back at 2:00.
Good. He's scared.
Alicia, hi. How are you?
Good.
What's up here? Hi, Marilyn.
Hi, Alicia. I'm sorry. I had a bout of nausea but I'm all good.
Um, do you guys mind if I... If I, uh...
Oh, here it is... if I eat?
No, not at all.
Welcome, by the way.
Thanks. So...
This is the new... Firm.
It's nice.
We're in the early stages yet.
What do you need?
Mm. Sorry, pumpkin pop-tart.
They're the only things that settle my stomach.
Um, Peter
would like to come by and congratulate you,
and we were acting as a sort of advance team.
You want to negotiate his first visit?
No.
Yes.
There can be no photographs while he's here.
No contacting the press.
No clients to be informed of his visit.
No press releases.
Look, if Peter wants to come here to
congratulate his wife on her new firm,
I'm thrilled.
But there'll be no policing between us.
No rules, no exemptions. Just peter
deciding to drop by. That's all.
Look, Alicia, the only...
Eli, are you all right?
Y-yes. I'm-I'm-I'm, uh...
No, uh, what, um...
Okay.
Uh, I'll be right back.
He ran.
What?
Lalo. Uh, Eduardo Hierra.
He fled back to Mexico.
He... When?
An hour ago. He skipped bail,
and the rumor is he caught a private plane to Nuevo Laredo.
Tomas doesn't have to testify.
Eli, are you all right?
I was wondering if I'd run into you.
I just didn't think it would be so literal.
I saw you.
I was up...
Uh, how lo... how long are you in town?
Um, a few days.
I... I've been following you.
You've...?
I mean, wi-winning the election and the governorship.
It's all very impressive.
Thank you, thank you.
You, too. You're at the outsider group.
Yes, um, we've been following each other.
Well, um, I better get going.
I have this thing with my boss.
Yeah, m-me, too, me, too.
Let's have dinner.
I'm... what?
Tonight.
Let's have dinner.
Um... Yeah, I'd love that.
Will Gardner.
Oh, hey, Joe, what a pleasure.
I need you bad now.
I'd like that.
Today?
No, I haven't seen her.
Okay, what's her name?
Diane, who's Natalie Flores?
She used to work here. Why?
That was her boss Joe Pallotta the lobbyist.
He wants to bring all his legal work here,
But he sent Natalie to sound us out.
You haven't seen her?
No.
Okay, well,
Can you keep an eye out for her?
She has a case she needs help with.
We want to give her all our attention.
Yes?
It was a good meeting.
She liked me.
What was the case?
Some Mexican illegal alien thing.
Howard, what did you say to her?
Nothing.
Nothing... I complimented her.
I said how great Mexicans are,
how sexy they are.
Oh, Lord.
She asked for Alicia Florrick's address.
It's not gone yet.
Call Joe back and explain.
Hello.
Mrs. Florrick, they took him, they took Tomas.
What?
Uh, he-hello, Elena?
The agents said that they were taking him to Nuevo Laredo.
That's where Lalo is.
Lalo will kill Tomas as soon as he gets off the bus.
Okay, just sit tight, Elena, it's been a misunderstanding.
I'll get on with the AUSA.
I saw what he does to snitches, Mrs. Florrick.
He cuts their stomachs open, hangs them from bridges.
Please help me, please.
I will. I will call you right back.
Yes, I need to speak to AUSA Karl Dolan.
It's an emergency.
Well, find him.
Kalinda.
You shouldn't be here, Robyn.
I'll be gone in ten minutes.
What do you need?
Have they hired anybody yet to replace me?
You can't come back here, Robyn.
I know, but why not?
If they haven't hired anyone, why?
You're at Florrick-Agos.
But they're going to lay me off.
I'm sorry, could you, um, just put in a good word for me?
Look, Robyn, it won't work.
They won't hire you back here.
You know, too much has happened.
You need to make yourself hard.
You need to make yourself indispensable.
That's why people keep you on.
But I'm not you.
You don't need to be me.
They were laying me off
At the State's Attorney's Office five years ago,
So I took control.
Nothing changes you like the loss of a job.
Now go, you can't be here.
Go ahead, take it.
No.
Eli, if you don't get it, I'm going to.
What happened to your Cirque du Soleil boyfriend?
He got married.
I'm sorry.
You're not sorry.
It's the Governor's Office.
I'll call back.
I'm hearing your boss speak at the minority voters' conference.
Yes, I think he's talking about redistricting,
how it's marginalizing the minority vote.
Actually, uh, unfortunately he had to cancel that.
Oh, when was this?
Redistricting is a hard subject.
Either way, you... You offend someone.
Uh, I should get this.
Please.
Hello.
Alicia?
What's wrong?
Oh, my God, when?
No, no, no, I'll... I, I will join you.
Um, give me 20 minutes.
Eli, I'm so sorry, I,
Um, I have to...
This friend-- he's being deported.
Can we do this another time?
Yes, of course.
I understand you're upset.
Upset?
We're talking about a man's life.
Tomas Ruiz did everything you asked.
Not everything... he didn't testify.
Because he never had the chance.
Look, that has nothing to do with my job.
The person he was going to testify against fled.
That is not his fault.
We have very few s-visas to give out,
and the rules for granting them are strict.
The recipient has to provide testimony
that helps lead to a conviction.
Mr. Dolan, you asked my client
to inform on a dangerous criminal,
and when that criminal jumped bail,
you deported him to the exact same place the criminal fled to.
I realize it sounds unfair.
No, what it sounds like is a death sentence.
Okay, this conversation is moot.
4:00 A.M. Tomas Ruiz
was boarded onto a deportation bus.
He'll be in Mexico in 12 hours.
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
This is the problem.
The Feds were looking for Tomas I. Ruiz.
He's a con man...
Insurance fraud, airbag theft.
That's why his deportation was expedited.
Our guy is Tomas Y. Ruiz,
But, uh, they think he's the con man.
They're deporting the wrong guy.
We can't clear this up?
Unfortunately immigration has him listed with both spellings.
And since neither of them has
a valid social security number...
As far as the government's concerned,
they're the same person.
So, what do we do?
Find the other Tomas Ruiz.
Show the Feds they deported the wrong man.
And how do we do that?
Let me find him.
Well, we have 11 hours till Tomas crosses the border.
Then, I'd better get started.
Okay, I'll see if I can get anywhere in court.
Howard Lyman is one of our oldest partners.
We keep him around as a legacy.
I'll be right back. Want anything?
Look, have Natalie Flores come back.
We'll have a good sit-down.
Because I'm warning you now,
Florrick-Agos isn't up to this case.
It's really too bad.
Are you talking to me?
Yes.
It's too bad about Will.
He's still in pain.
I'm David Lee, by the way.
I'm Isabel.
Want a pretzel?
No, thank you.
He's still in pain about Alicia.
And who's Alicia?
Oh, someone who...
used to work here.
He could tell you more.
I'm looking for Tomas Ruiz.
He's not here.
I'm working as a skip tracer.
If you help us find him,
There will be a percentage of the bond for you.
He's not here, but he had a girlfriend--
Christina Stewart.
Do you have her address?
Your wife would not agree to set any rules.
She said if you wanted to come see her at her new firm,
She would welcome it, but...
Sorry.
She would not police her firm.
It would be our advice to steer clear
until her firm establishes itself.
No, I'm, I'm going tonight, thanks.
Um, anything else?
Um, yes, we've, um, we've gone to the trouble
of canceling your speech to the minority voter council.
Oh, no, we've decided to keep that.
I'm sorry, what?
It's worth our effort to do a redistricting speech.
Marilyn.
Eli, I thought we decided it would hurt the governor
to come down on one side or the other.
Yes, I've changed my mind.
Okay, so I guess I'm giving a speech.
Eli, what is going on?
I changed my mind.
Have you never changed your mind?
No.
Well, this is what it looks like.
I'm looking for Tomas.
I don't know anybody named Tomas.
You can tell him for me that Gloria is looking for him.
I told you, I don't know him.
You can tell him that Illinois has laws about child support,
and he'd better pay.
Open the door, you son of a bitch!
You got a kid, and you didn't tell me about it?!
What?
I have to hear about it from some
blonde skank who showed up at my doorstep.
Hello, Tomas.
So, you're saying the U.S. Attorney is in breach?
Yes, your Honor. They made an agreement,
and they didn't honor it.
We honored every part of our agreement,
Except the granting of the visa.
That's the only part that matters!
Because Mr. Ruiz did not comply
with his duties under the agreement.
Your Honor, they created the danger
by asking him to testify.
But when he was denied that chance,
through no fault of his own,
they let him be sent right into the lion's mouth!
And he'll be there in ten hours.
So really, it's an equitable argument.
Robyn, what have you got?
The other Tomas Ruiz.
What do you mean?
I found the other Tomas Ruiz.
You did?
In two hours?
Yes.
Uh, will he testify?
Well, he wants something in return.
Ten grand.
Get him in here, and we'll work it out.
Oh, and, Robyn,
Good job.
The problem, Mrs. Florrick, is, your client is coming
to a court of equity with unclean hands,
或恶意行为的原告提供救济
which, as I'm sure you will remember from law school,
you're not allowed to do.
Your Honor, excuse me.
We'd like to amend our argument.
We've found the real Tomas Ruiz.
The real...? Who, now?
Our client was mistakenly deported
because immigration confused him with someone else.
We've located the man they were actually looking for.
Well, that's a bit of a sticky wicket,
seeing as how your client's already on the transport.
Yes, your Honor, which is why time is of the essence here.
Yes, but unfortunately,
I'm not empowered to hear that claim.
Only the Board of Immigration Appeals is.
And I'd hurry.
The problem is, Mrs. Florrick, the transport's already left.
Yes, but the wrong man is on the bus.
No, Your Honor. There's no dispute
that Tomas Y. Ruiz was in this country illegally,
and therefore, subject to deportation.
Yes, but not expedited deportation.
I'm afraid that's a distinction for earlier.
Prior to the transport's departure.
We can't waste taxpayer money turning a bus around
to bring someone back who's just going
to be deported again in a few months.
This isn't about deportation.
Our client faces grave danger the second he gets to Mexico.
Even if that's true, your Honor, that's an asylum claim.
Let me guess. You don't hear asylum claims?
That's correct, Mrs. Florrick. We don't hear asylum claims.
We only hear appeals of asylum claims.
The initial claim has to be brought to an immigration judge.
I told you to cancel everything.
Oh, ah, no. Send her in.
I'm sorry to drop in unexpected.
Please, please. No, uh, would you...?
No, I... I can't stay very long. I have to get to court.
But I wanted to apologize.
For?
For dinner last night.
Or not-dinner last night.
For running out on you.
You didn't running out on me.
I'm afraid I did.
But it was for a good cause, and, anyway, uh...
I have to run out on you again right now,
But I would love it
if we could have dinner the next time.
That would be great.
Next time you are in town, yeah.
Oh, and, um, here,
I got you dried apricots.
I dont know why.
I thought of you with dried apricots.
Ok, I'll talk to you later.
Natalie, wait.
We have to have dinner tonight, or it would never happen.
Really?
Why is that?
I don't know. I just have a premonition that
we both lead very complicated lives...
Mr. Gold?
Not now!
If we don't take advantage of these few minutes we have,
we might never get the chance again.
I'll make a reservation.
I don't normally do this.
What?
Run after people.
I'm not a running-after-people sort.
And I don't normally buy dried apricots.
They were just in the store downstairs, so I bought them.
Throw them away.
Okay? They're probably gross.
So, you'll call me about where?
I will.
How you doing?
Good.
Who's Alicia?
What?
Who's Alicia?
Someone thinks you're in pain over Alicia,
and that's what I'm about.
Why are you about anything?
I don't know.
I didn't think I was.
Who someone? Who's telling you this?
David... Something.
He looks like a jack-o'-lantern.
David lee.
I don't know. One of your lawyers.
He doesn't like you in my office.
He wants to poison the stream.
So, who is she?
Alicia was an employee
who left to start her own firm.
You were sleeping with her?
For a while.
Then what?
What happened after a while?
I don't know.
Was she good?
Are we having fun?
You tell me.
You taste like chocolate.
That's because I'm made of chocolate.
Your honor,
only someone facing a recognized form
of persecution can file a claim for asylum.
Which Tomas Ruiz is, Your Honor.
Oh, really? Which one? Race?
Religion? Nationality? Politics?
Social group. He's part of a social group
That is known to face persecution in many parts of Mexico.
And what social group would that be?
Snitches, Your Honor.
Oh, come on.
This is an affidavit from a professor of Mexican cultural studies
Testifying that large portions of Mexico are controlled
by drug cartels who deal violently...
And I am sure
It's fascinating, but the simple fact is,
Tomas Ruiz is not, actually, a snitch,
Because he never actually snitched.
Your honor, that's sophistry.
Yes, Mrs. Florrick.
Even if snitches qualify as a social group,
You haven't demonstrated that Mr. Ruiz meets the criteria.
Your honor, we have seven and a half hours
before Mr. Ruiz is in Mexico.
洛克哈特&加德纳律所
Yes, but, as Bob Dylan said,
"Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed..."
Hello?
Natalie, it's Will Gardner.
I wonder if you remember me?
I'm one of the partners at Lockhart & Gardner.
Uh, yes, I remember.
I have to apologize for yesterday.
I didn't realize you had dropped by.
And I know you've gone somewhere else with your case.
Yes, Florrick-Agos.
But I wanted you to know I reviewed
all Tomas Ruiz's materials,
And if you're ever looking for another perspective,
Please don't hesitate to call.
Thank you for calling, Mr. Gardner,
But, um, I didn't have the best experience at your office.
I know. I understand that, and I'm very sorry.
Howard Lyman is one of our legacy partners,
And he would very much like to apologize for his comments.
Please, Natalie, just drop by,
Let us talk to you.
Let me think about it.
Good.
That's all I ask.
Thank you. Good-bye.
You're good luck. You know that?
I do know that.
Lesbian, gay or transgender?
Only if he's in danger because of it.
What about governmental persecution?
You mean, his political beliefs?
Or we just argue that the Mexican government can't protect him.
They're not the ones threatening him.
I served Dolan. We are back in court in an hour.
Great. Now we just need something to argue.
Blood feud.
You could argue there's a blood feud
between Tomas' family and Hierra's family.
But we don't have any evidence of it, do we?
We might.
Really? What?
Robyn, what?
Have you noticed that everyone's changing?
Yeah.
So, what's up?
I'm concerned about Eli.
What is it this time?
He flip-flopped on your speaking
at the minority voter conference.
Well, you know, one of the things I value about Eli
is that he keeps an open mind,
which means that he sometimes changes it.
I think he might have changed it
because of someone else's influence.
Her name is Natalie Flores.
She works for a lobbying firm.
Are you saying that you think Eli's on
the payroll of some lobbyist?
No, I think it's personal.
Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm sorry. I hate being weak.
You're not being weak.
Can I get you something, or...?
Oh, I'm out of my pop-tarts.
That's not good.
No, it's not.
Natalie Fores?
Uh, yes, yes, right. Um...
Well, just to be clear, if Eli's directing policy
due to somebody's outside influence,
then, that's a potential ethical violation there.
Yes. I understand.
And I'm gonna look into it.
Okay. Thank you.
I was complimenting her.
Didn't ask her to clean my office.
I just think this one is... touchy.
This one?
This... This Natalie.
Maybe she's a lesbian.
I don't think she's a lesbian.
But she is our link to a potentially valuable client.
Howard, we're going to need you to apologize immediately.
Fine.
Well, what do you want me to say?
I think it's important for Natalie to understand
that, you know, you see her as intelligent and capable.
Not just some spicy tamale?
Hmm? Oh, come on. I'm just kidding.
Kidding Is what got us into this mess.
No, political correctness got us into this mess.
But I'll get us out of it.
I don't think I'm gonna do the speech
at the minority voter conference.
You aren't?
Redistricting cuts both ways.
I don't want to be accused of supporting ghettoizing anyone.
You aren't ghettoizing anyone. They want this.
A lot of people want a lot of things.
Yes, but we've already rsvp'd and...
And what?
Why is this suddenly so important that I do this, Eli?
Because this redistricting amendment has legs.
No.
What changed your mind?
Eli,
I need to know that I can trust you.
I need to know that the advice you give me
is in my best interests.
It has never been anything but.
Good.
As long as you don't let anyone use you.
Or me.
The next time you want to correct my behavior, come to me.
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you think you saw,
but if you're trying to score points with Peter...
I'm not trying to score points.
Then why bring it up?
Because it's my job.
My private life falls way outside your job description.
Not when it impacts the counsel you give the governor.
Let's get something straight: I have been with Peter since...
I'm sorry. I can't do this right now.
Oh, spare me the rigors of pregnancy bs!
Your honor, blood feuds are a recognized ground for asylum.
Yes, in places where they exist.
Albania, for example, the Caucasus, Sicily...
The concept applies anywhere someone is targeted
because of bad blood between families.
In this case, Lalo Hierra
and his family have a grudge against Tomas Ruiz.
No. They don't hate him because his name is Tomas Ruiz.
They hate him because he...
...almost snitched.
Besides, Your Honor,
even if they could argue blood feud,
where's the evidence?
Right here.
What a surprise. Now what?
Just this morning, mrs. Ruiz received this bullet in her mailbox,
with the letters "L.C." written on the side.
That's Lalo Hierra's calling card. It's a clear threat.
Hold on. We have no way to verify...
Your honor, As soon as this was brought
to our attention we brought it to you.
Okay, enough.
Mrs. Florrick, Mr. Agos, I'm sorry,
but blood feud is a very specific claim,
and I'm just not seeing enough here to support it.
Your honor, this bullet is clearly a warning
of violence to come to Mrs. Ruiz and her family.
But it isn't relevant to asylum.
Maybe not,
以严重方式走私人口的被害者
but it is relevant to an application for a T visa.
T visa?
Yes.
The Ruiz family has been the victim of a crime,
witness intimidation.
That is one of the recognized grounds for granting a T visa.
Your honor, this is absurd.
Hold on, Mr. Dolan.
"And someone says,
'you're in the wrong place, my friend.
You better leave.'"
Bob Dylan again, Your Honor?
It's a good claim, Mrs. Florrick.
Actually, it's an excellent claim, but unfortunately
I can't consider a visa application.
Your Honor, Mr. Ruiz's bus is going to reach the border
in less than two hours.
I understand, but you need to see
An immigration case worker for that.
And the chain of custody?
As soon as she received the bullet, mrs. Ruiz called me.
I rushed over and took possession of it.
Even so, I can only get
to a t visa for Mrs. Ruiz and her son.
They were the ones who were the victims of intimidation.
Yes, but it was meant as a warning for the entire family.
Perhaps. But by the time the bullet was delivered,
Mr. Ruiz was already out of the state.
Look, Mrs....
Bardos, but Estelle is fine.
Estelle, any minute now that bus is gonna cross the border
into Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.
Our client won't make it a mile past the checkpoint.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Florrick,
I truly am, but we have rules.
Rules? Really?
Let me tell you something, lady, your rules
are right out of 1984.
The book, not the year.
I am sorry.
Hello, Mr. Gardner? I would like to meet.
Natalie, how good to see you again.
Mr. Lyman. How are you?
Fine, thank you.
Natalie, thank you for giving L.G. a second chance.
Yes, and I'd like to apologize for our last meeting.
I was a little distracted by the news
of a dear friend of mine dying.
I'm sorry.
It's fine. But I wanted to be clear
that, uh... how wrong I was in my comments the last time.
Think nothing of it. Oh, uh, I'd like to introduce you
to the partner at our lobbying firm,
Joe Pallotta.
Hey, hey, man.
How's it going?
No, the transport is stopped at the border,
but they're about to release it. Why? Is...
Is there a problem?
For me? No. For the government of Mexico, possibly.
This is immigration enforcement's expedited deportation list.
And you can see, Tomas I. Ruiz is on that bus.
He's one of the most infamous con men in the U.S.,
responsible for millions of dollars in damages.
He specializes in airbag fraud.
Airbag fraud?
Not only does he cheat people,
but if they get into an accident,
they don't have a functioning airbag.
And given Mexico's traffic safety record,
I'm sure that would be troubling.
But rather than deal with the problem here,
the U.S. Government decided to pass the buck
by sending him back to you.
Of course, it is always within the discretion of any sovereign nation
whether or not they choose to accept a deportee back into their country.
They turned him away at the border.
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Thank you.
Daddy's gonna be okay.
Feeling good?
I guess.
You should be. You pulled it out of the fire for us.
Well, it's my job.
Yeah. It is.
Keep doing it.
Wait, his own country wouldn't let him in?
Somehow, he ended up on the Mexican consulate watch list.
Oh, thank God.
Alicia, thank you.
Just remember to tell all your fee-paying friends about us.
Bye.
Excuse me. Um, I'd like to order two glasses of this.
Thanks.
You'd be wise to get here fast.
I'm in a great mood and I have a corporate credit card.
Natalie, hi.
Hi. You sound...
something.
It's just that I'm not gonna be able to make it.
It's work, naturally.
Peter's decision to cancel his speech is wreaking havoc.
We have... legislators from minority districts
at our door with pitchforks.
And you're the last line of defense.
I'm sorry, Natalie.
Peter needs me.
He's lucky to have you.
Fly safe.
That was just me being stupid.
Eli, if this is too complicated...
No. No, it's not.
Look, I lie 24/7 for my job...
it's actually a gift...
but lying to you gave me a stomachache.
S-so...
How were the dried apricots?
Not so good.
Well, maybe next time I'll...
I just had to do that.
Well, Marilyn, I hope I didn't make any ethical infractions
on the elevator ride.
No, you pushed the button with dignity and honor.
Ah, you must be a good influence on me.
I wanted to push all the buttons
and stop on every floor. Hey.
These are some digs.
Uh, I think the operative word is "cheap."
Nice to see you again, Marilyn.
You, too.
Okay. Where on the unethical spectrum does it fall
to have an intern help my wife unpack?
Well, technically in the red zone,
but we'll note it as a goodwill gesture
by the governor to a citizen.
Well, thank you.
Guys.
Thank you for dropping by, Mr. Governor.
No problem, Mrs. First lady.
You know what?
I think you're gonna take over the world from here.
You think so?
