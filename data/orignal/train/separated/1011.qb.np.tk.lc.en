kate leaves you a bottle with a map on it ,
and this is where it leads us -- grand central station ?
it &apos;s something i &apos;d recognize , moz .
something significant .
s @-@ significant ?
grand central station !
something familiar .
she could have sent us anywhere ,
so she sends us to a place that leads everywhere ?
moz .
you know , there &apos;s a great oyster bar in there .
hey , i think there &apos;s something in here .
&quot; x &quot; marks the spot ... again ?
kate likes the classics .
&quot; dear neal , heard you &apos;re looking for me .
&quot; wish i could explain more , but time is not on our side ,
&quot; but you need to stop looking .
&quot; no one can deny what we have , but it &apos;s over .
&quot; please move on .
kate . &quot;
all this for &quot; move on . &quot;
oddly bipolar .
i &apos;d rather have some oysters .
have a good weekend ?
ah , nothing too exciting .
i went to the park .
oh , great . glad you &apos;re getting out .
coffee ?
love to . no time . got a stolen painting .
it &apos;s june &apos;s italian roast .
it &apos;s ...
haustenberg .
haustenberg , well ...
is it a museum heist ?
no . residential robbery .
i &apos;d like to meet the person
who keeps a haustenberg over their mantel .
i love haustenberg .
which one of his paintings was stolen ?
this one is called &quot; young girl with a locket . &quot;
no photograph ?
no , but i bet you it &apos;s a painting
of a young girl wearing a locket .
you don &apos;t get enough credit for your deductive skills .
it &apos;s worth $ 2 million and change .
that &apos;s nice .
haustenbergs are rare .
not many of his works made it out of hungary after the war .
yeah . rare can make it valuable -- very valuable .
what are you looking at me for ?
why do you think ?
i didn &apos;t steal it .
i know you didn &apos;t steal it ,
but you like paintings .
i &apos;m worried that if we find it ,
it may be too much temptation for you .
i can handle temptation .
do you want to keep your eyes on the road ?
this is a taurus . car can take care of itself .
i &apos;m keeping my eyes on you .
good , good . the road is important , too .
i see the road .
sorry about that .
no . don &apos;t apologize . that was -- he stopped .
you know i didn &apos;t steal it . you checked my anklet ?
i always check your anklet .
i pull a map up on you every day
so i can see exactly where you &apos;ve been .
what was so interesting about grand central station ?
oyster bar -- it &apos;s the best in town .
i stayed within my two @-@ mile radius .
i wonder if we &apos;ve been a little too generous on that .
oh , yeah .
what , are you gonna sulk now ?
you don &apos;t trust me .
what did reagan say ?
&quot; trust , but verify . &quot;
that was also the motto of the soviet secret police .
get used to it , comrade .
eyes ! road !
let &apos;s just recover the painting .
yeah , and drive .
wow , so , the fbi -- you &apos;re really
taking this seriously , huh ?
we are .
are you the homeowner ?
yes .
my parents are dead , i &apos;m over 21 , and i was robbed .
any other questions ?
was the painting insured ?
no .
it &apos;s worth $ 2.6 million .
... that &apos;s where it was .
tuesdays i have classes .
uh , the instructor let us out early .
i came in here , and there was this
monster ... here ...
and he shoved me up against the wall .
he hurt you ?
yeah .
i hit him in the face ,
and he said if i did it again , he would kill me .
what did you do ?
i hit him again .
do you have a photo of the painting ?
your report only had a description .
yeah . yeah .
can i help you ?
oh , it &apos;s okay , gary . it &apos;s the fbi .
they &apos;re here about the painting .
oh , of course .
thank you for coming so quickly .
sure , sure . were you there when it happened ?
no . i was at work at the time .
wish i could be more help .
great .
we looking at an inside job ?
thief knew her schedule . nothing else was taken .
i &apos;d go with that .
i &apos;d go with that , too .
help julianna with that photo .
gary , i have a few questions .
gary &apos;s your , um ... ?
uncle .
will that do ?
oh , my goodness .
that &apos;s my grandmother . that &apos;s the painting behind her .
could be your twin .
i &apos;ll take that as a compliment .
i was named after her . she raised me .
when she died , she left me the house ...
and the painting .
what did uncle gary think of that ?
you don &apos;t look like an fbi agent .
i &apos;ll take that as a compliment .
what &apos;s an fbi agent look like ?
him .
you got the photo ?
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ve never seen a guy lawyer up that fast .
i &apos;ve got that he &apos;s a stock trader on wall street
and that his attorney
will answer any further questions i might have .
so , uncle gary tips off the thief ,
splits the take .
more likely uncle gary owes money to somebody ,
and he got tired of staring at 2 million bucks
hanging on the wall .
now he shuts up ,
and we do this the hard way .
the hard way ?
a @-@ all we need from gary is the name
of the guy he &apos;s working with , right ?
right .
so , why don &apos;t i talk to him ?
you ?
yeah .
o @-@ okay , let me rephrase that .
since i am a consultant
and not technically an employee of the fbi --
a consultant on a tenuous probation .
as i &apos;m constantly reminded .
is there anything illegal about me talking to him ?
you can &apos;t threaten him .
don &apos;t plan to .
or lie to him .
all right .
all right . no lying .
i &apos;m just gonna ask him for the name .
tell me , gary ,
does julianna know you helped steal the painting ?
you can &apos;t be here .
my lawyer was very clear .
first of all , hiring a lawyer makes you look guilty .
he told me specifically not to talk to the fbi .
do i look like an fbi agent ?
who are you ?
think hard , gary .
did he send you ?
what do you think ?
god , i knew this would happen .
what , that whole thing at the house was a setup ?
how &apos;d it go wrong ?
julianna wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
now she &apos;s a witness .
it wasn &apos;t my fault . her class got out early .
please don &apos;t hurt her .
it &apos;s not me you need to convince .
tell him --
tell him i &apos;ll make sure she doesn &apos;t cause any trouble .
she &apos;s ready to sit with a sketch artist .
this is the kind of thing that makes it much harder for him
to sell the painting .
how about ... here .
how about a good @-@ faith payment ?
here . here &apos;s $ 300 . that &apos;s all i got .
$ 300 .
gary .
all right , you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
i can write him a check .
that could work .
he wrote you a personal check
to the guy he helped steal his mother &apos;s painting .
he was very insistent .
no threats . no lies .
i let him do all the talking .
i &apos;m calling this a gray area .
oh . gerard dorsett .
you know him ?
yeah .
yeah , he &apos;s a ... bad guy .
so i figured .
hey , what about julianna ?
he figures out she &apos;s talking to us --
let &apos;s catch the bastard before that happens .
yeah , we got him .
we &apos;ve been sitting on him for two days .
they &apos;ve gone to every high @-@ end gallery in manhattan
offering the haustenberg .
who &apos;s that ?
the big guy ? joshua .
ex @-@ military , the muscle who stole the painting .
julianna wasn &apos;t kidding about the punch .
girl has an arm .
and the other guy is dorsett ,
french expat .
what &apos;s he into , besides shaking down stockbrokers ?
high @-@ end loan @-@ sharking ,
although calling him a loan shark
is like calling oedipus a mama &apos;s boy .
he makes questionable loans with big corporate money .
get behind on your payment , he &apos;ll firebomb your office .
but the good news is , you get to meet him tomorrow .
how &apos;d you arrange that ?
i set it up .
neal , this is taryn vandersant .
she &apos;s a buyer at the lambert gallery
and is nice enough to help us out on this one .
i convinced dorsett i have a wealthy client
who &apos;s very interested in the painting .
how much is he asking ?
$ 100,000 .
we &apos;ve arranged to have the exchange happen
at the gallery , neal .
jones , let &apos;s get a prep .
this should be fun .
what ?
have you ever met a woman who didn &apos;t ...
brittni ... brittni nichole ...
in second grade .
i had a gap in my teeth .
kate loves the classics .
that &apos;s a big load of laundry .
yeah . it just sold for $ 120,000 .
what ? !
what ?
can &apos;t put a price on art .
no , you can &apos;t , which is why i think $ 2.6 million
is a little steep for the haustenberg .
you &apos;re not a fan of haustenberg ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s a little cartoony for my taste .
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re a philistine .
yeah , yeah .
i -- i &apos;m the crazy one .
you all set ?
all set .
well , let &apos;s get wired .
100 grand in cash -- that &apos;s a lot of money .
tempted ?
why would you think that ?
peter warned me about you .
warned you ?
sounds ominous .
does it ?
yeah .
is it true you just got out of prison ?
do i look like i just got out of prison ?
he said you &apos;d do that .
what ?
redirect .
yes , i just got out of prison ,
yes , peter is the guy who put me there ,
and , yes ...
i &apos;m tempted .
is it true you escaped for a girl ?
some people think i &apos;m a romantic .
did she ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
we got dorsett crossing 20th .
let &apos;s get a camera on that .
okay .
they &apos;re approaching the gallery .
team one has the eye .
good to see you again .
good to see you .
as i said on the phone , this is mr. devore .
call me george .
it &apos;s smaller than i expected .
have you seen the &quot; mona lisa &quot; ? it &apos;s tiny .
could i see the money , please ?
i &apos;d like to authenticate it .
so , you two have known each other for a long time ?
we &apos;ve been friends for , i don &apos;t know , how long &apos;s it been ?
years .
beautiful people are never just friends .
george has a girlfriend .
again , monogamy is the great casualty of beauty .
not always .
please .
we use the expression &quot; butterfly &quot;
for a man who flits from flower to flower .
a man such as yourself could be
quite a successful butterfly .
we consider butterflies weak , delicate creatures .
yes , but flap their wings , and they can set off hurricanes .
that &apos;s beautiful . you should write a book .
can we just -- close the doors , please .
i have a girlfriend myself .
is she faithful ?
she &apos;s french . i try not to think about it .
brigitte arrived last night ,
and i shouldn &apos;t leave her alone in a new town for long .
perhaps we could hurry .
of course . lights , please .
i &apos;ve got fluorescing cadmium green and azurite blue .
that puts the paint composition pre @-@ 1960 .
perhaps you can explain
why there are people signaling each other outside .
you want us to go ?
not yet . we can &apos;t risk it .
who are they ?
if you brought the fbi into this --
it was not me !
i told you to keep a low profile .
you were careless .
you &apos;ve been flashing this painting all over town .
they followed you here .
something is not right here .
damn right it &apos;s not .
for my time and inconvenience .
that &apos;s it . move , move !
team one , team two ,
alpha bravo is exiting the rear of the building -- move in .
go ! go !
go ! follow jones !
you okay ?
we &apos;re fine .
arrest them .
arrest them . we have to keep their cover .
handcuff them . read them their rights , everything .
you two are on the north end , opposite side of jones !
go !
where are they ?
they disappeared between the buildings .
anyone have eyes ?
negative .
all we got is this .
ah , they switched clothes . damn it !
are things always this interesting when you &apos;re around ?
come on .
you &apos;re under arrest .
so , how upset were they that you lost the 100 grand ?
&quot; upset &quot; is a bit of an understatement .
it started an administrative inquiry .
everything will be fine if i recover it --
when i recover it .
well , the good news is neal didn &apos;t take it .
this is progress .
do you think he actually had anything to do with it ?
no , but the thing about neal --
nothing is ever what it seems .
the guy &apos;s a contradiction .
he &apos;s obsessed about kate ,
but you should have seen him flirting with this girl at the takedown .
well , honey , that &apos;s who neal is .
that &apos;s never gonna change .
that &apos;s what i love about you so much .
what , that i lost all ability to flirt when we got married ?
honey , it was even questionable then .
it was .
who &apos;s the new girl ?
taryn vandersant .
don &apos;t know her .
she &apos;s a buyer at the lambert gallery .
she &apos;s beautiful , seems nice .
well , if neal &apos;s interested , you should encourage it .
encourage it ? oh , i need that like a hole in the head .
honey , if he would fall for the new girl ,
he might actually stop chasing kate .
love you .
love you .
you and taryn were getting along pretty good yesterday .
she &apos;s not my type .
what ? not your -- why isn &apos;t she your type ?
she loves art .
she looks like lara croft in khakis .
really ? does she bake cookies for orphans , too ?
she does .
i get it .
meet a nice girl , maybe settle down .
simplify my life , probably save yours .
you &apos;re lying about the cookies .
prove it .
who &apos;s that ?
curator from the channing museum .
what ?
why -- why is he here ?
the haustenberg . he says it belongs to them .
lose the hat .
how come the channing didn &apos;t report it missing ?
we did report it , when it was stolen in 1967 .
i have a question .
the painting was stolen in &apos; 67,
but it &apos;s not listed on the art @-@ loss registry .
the registry was established in 1990 .
&apos;91 , actually .
you could have re @-@ filed the claim .
i &apos;m sorry . you are who ?
neal caffrey . he &apos;s one of our art consultants .
caffrey .
not familiar with that name .
it &apos;s probably for the best .
you &apos;re an expert on haustenberg ?
all the late european post @-@ impressionists .
i authenticated &quot; young girl with locket &quot; myself
when it first entered our collection .
you &apos;ll agree it &apos;s an excellent work ,
a bit sentimental for my taste ,
but the matisse influence is apparent .
oh , well , considering matisse was a fauvist ,
i wouldn &apos;t agree with that at all .
unless you &apos;re talking about his early work ,
which i don &apos;t think you are ,
and if you are , you &apos;re just wrong .
we have reason to believe that this was taken
in a residential robbery .
what happened to the painting
when it was taken from my museum is not my concern .
now , someone elected to buy stolen property .
i believe that is a crime .
do you know how the haustenberg
came into your grandmother &apos;s possession ?
she brought it with her from hungary
when she came to this country after the war .
why ?
agent burke , got a question for you .
yeah .
excuse me .
play nice , kids .
what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;re not a very good liar .
your grandmother stole the painting .
why would you say that ?
she never had it insured .
that was my first clue .
is this like a good @-@ cop , bad @-@ cop thing ?
he takes a call . you wink at me .
if we get the painting , it &apos;s going back to the channing ,
unless you give us a good reason
to keep it away from them .
all right . tell me a story .
how did she take it ?
just ... hypothetically .
hypothetically ?
a little black dress , a laced bottle of whiskey ,
and a horny irish security guard .
why &apos;d she do it ?
that &apos;s the locket .
your grandmother &apos;s the little girl in the painting .
how &apos;s it going in there ?
oh , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s fine .
any luck on dorsett ?
no .
assuming you just walked with 100 grand in cash
and the painting , what do you do ?
go to ground till things cool off .
where do you go ?
dorsett said something about having a girlfriend .
brigitte .
yeah .
how many brigittes came in from france last night ?
accounting for middle names and spelling variations ,
a lot more than i thought .
well , we can discount connecting flights .
and women over 50 .
tell me i &apos;m wrong .
well , that leaves seven .
all right .
so , let &apos;s pull in some teams , and everybody take a brigitte .
we &apos;ll -- we &apos;ll take the girl staying at the gansevoort .
that &apos;s where i &apos;d stay .
you &apos;d think they &apos;d have a satellite for things like this .
the only thing a satellite is gonna tell us
is that he &apos;s not on the roof .
this is old @-@ school .
&quot; old @-@ school . &quot;
will you relax ?
you meditate ?
no .
really ?
you look like a guy who meditates .
sandwich ?
what is that smell ?
that &apos;s deviled ham .
no !
come on .
no !
no . wait . go back to the game .
no , i called it .
you were just touching the buttons . that &apos;s not calling it .
what are we , 12 ?
i guess we are .
when we &apos;re in your car , we can listen to your station .
i don &apos;t have a car .
poor life choice .
and we got the game .
what do you think you can afford in that place ?
spot me a $ 20 .
why don &apos;t you use your new gold card to get it ?
you know about that ?
keep it . it makes it easier for
me to know what you &apos;re buying .
all right , go , but no shenanigans .
you &apos;ve got 10 minutes . and keep your phone on .
that &apos;s for you .
escuse moi .
can i buy you a drink ?
what ?
what do you think ?
hookers ?
no . no .
that &apos;s brigitte and her friend .
i convinced them to invite us up to their suite .
brigitte likes me . you can have claire .
are you completely out of your mind ?
the room is rented in her name .
we &apos;re not breaking any laws if she invites us in .
the 100 grand and the painting could be inside .
wouldn &apos;t you like to know
if we &apos;re sitting in the right place ?
which one &apos;s claire ?
claire &apos;s cute .
yeah . she &apos;s exactly what i need in my life right now .
all right . there are no men &apos;s socks lying around .
brigitte does not look like a girl
who &apos;s worried about her boyfriend coming home .
peter , you have to relax .
if we have the wrong brigitte , we &apos;ll know soon enough .
beats sitting in the car , eating deviled ham .
all right , fine .
the second we find out if dorsett is staying here ,
we leave , and we call in reinforcements .
done .
they &apos;re coming .
merci .
ah , merci beaucoup .
she doesn &apos;t want us in there .
yeah , i saw her lock the door .
i bet there &apos;s a door in the bathroom
that connects to the master suite .
i can open it .
no , you can &apos;t .
i won &apos;t tell anyone . no , no .
you understand the rules here .
listen , i &apos;ve heard the speech .
what &apos;s that ?
they want to play strip poker .
i &apos;m kidding .
but could you imagine ?
they want music , all right ?
come on . relax . all right .
it &apos;s over there . come on .
juste un moment .
neal , i know what you &apos;re doing !
juste un moment .
cut the french crap ! get out here !
keep them occupied .
i can &apos;t keep them occupied !
i don &apos;t ... speak french !
you know what ? i should get up right now .
i @-@ i c-- i can &apos;t --
that &apos;s a good grape .
oh ! it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s just my phone .
just my phone .
no , i &apos;m just getting my phone .
i &apos;m just getting it . that &apos;s all i &apos;m doing .
just getting my -- see ?
no !
no ! please don &apos;t !
let &apos;s -- let me have the phone .
give me the phone !
thank you .
oh , god , it &apos;s el !
hello .
oh , hey . i didn &apos;t think i was gonna get you .
i was actually gonna leave a message .
oh , hi . yeah . well .
uh , saw that it was you . what &apos;s up ?
nothing . i just got back from a client dinner .
i wanted to see how the stakeout was going .
having a blast .
where are you ?
i &apos;m at a -- i &apos;m at a --
are you at a nightclub ?
yes , that &apos;s where i am .
we -- we -- we &apos;re at a nightclub .
we -- we followed him into a nightclub .
at the gansevoort ?
wow , honey . i &apos;m impressed .
i can &apos;t believe you got in there .
it &apos;s a long story , el .
el , i &apos;ve got to go . i &apos;ve got a situation here , okay ?
i love you , honey !
i love you . it &apos;s crowded .
it &apos;s crowded .
hey , neal . caffrey !
&quot; to my dearest julianna , keep this forever . &quot;
let me talk to elizabeth , all right ?
it &apos;s the least i can do .
no , the least you can do is nothing ,
which is exactly what you will do .
it &apos;s my fault .
no , i don &apos;t need you to lie to my wife .
you gonna do it yourself ?
no .
the truth , peter .
bold choice .
hypothetically
see , i would tell her that i wouldn &apos;t
stop complaining about the car ,
so you let me go into the nightclub ,
and you witnessed the suspect enter after me
and had no choice but to follow .
it &apos;s almost the truth .
it &apos;s better than alimony .
yeah .
we lost dorsett .
what about the painting and the cash ?
all gone .
dorsett escaped .
this is bad .
yeah , this is bad .
you know , this one may be a real problem , el .
so , if you don &apos;t find dorsett ,
what happens to neal ?
he &apos;s done . he &apos;s back inside .
do you actually think he stole it ?
yeah .
yeah .
you gonna be okay ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be -- i &apos;ll be fine , yeah .
honey , listen .
about last night at the hotel ...
you mean the nightclub .
yeah .
well ...
neal was complaining about my sandwich ,
and then he started fidgeting with the radio , so i --
there was no nightclub .
i know .
honey , you don &apos;t think after 10 years i know when you &apos;re ...
stretching the truth ?
well , that &apos;s a nice way of putting it .
next time , just tell me .
that &apos;s what i told neal .
then stick to it .
i will .
i know you &apos;re a good man .
was she cute ?
well , now , that depends on your definition ,
&apos;cause i @-@ i @-@ i got to plead the fifth on this one .
yeah , okay .
who is this ?
i could ask you the same thing .
you seem to have many names , george .
dorsett .
how &apos;d you get this number ?
you bought my girlfriend a drink with your credit card .
i &apos;m impressed with your resourcefulness .
now you will see mine . i want the painting .
if it is not returned ,
joshua will pay a visit to your
beautiful friend at the gallery .
you leave her out of this .
brigitte was out of bounds , yet you involved her .
you set the rules .
now you must play by them .
i need two days .
that &apos;s all you have .
you stole the painting ?
i was going to give it back to julianna .
you &apos;re like a child -- no sense of consequence .
okay . will you look at the inscription ?
the channing curator said he authenticated the painting
before it was stolen .
he saw that it belonged to julianna
and chose to ignore it .
and you &apos;re robin hood .
and did i forget to mention the part
where you stole the painting ? !
i didn &apos;t think dorsett would get away .
this is because you don &apos;t like the guy from the channing .
you did this for spite .
i &apos;ve done things for less .
i can &apos;t let him go after taryn .
so , what are you gonna do ?
this better be good .
i took the painting .
damn it , neal .
i wasn &apos;t gonna --
i did it for --
i can use it to catch dorsett .
he doesn &apos;t know i work for you .
we &apos;ll set it up tomorrow .
now get the hell out of my house .
goodbye , elizabeth
bye , neal .
well , he , uh ...
told you the truth about the painting .
because they threatened taryn .
it &apos;s a start .
yeah .
it &apos;s a start .
you know you have absolutely no impulse control .
hand me the naples yellow .
haustenberg &apos;s brushwork is much more fluid .
you &apos;re being choppy .
my brushwork &apos;s fine .
this could trick the occasional tourist ,
but this guy at the channing will not be fooled .
i &apos;m sure he won &apos;t .
this pigment needs to be aged .
i &apos;ll go preheat the oven .
it &apos;s 125 .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i know how to age a painting .
how tenuous is my probation ?
it &apos;s pretty thin .
we need this one .
it &apos;s simple , right ?
yeah , so don &apos;t make it complicated .
take dorsett down quickly .
if i get him , you trust me again ?
yeah , comrade .
you still gonna verify ?
oh , yeah .
here we go .
surprised you had the guts to come yourself .
it &apos;s not bravery .
i simply don &apos;t trust joshua with a million @-@ dollar painting .
is it hard to live like that ,
not trusting the people closest to you ?
i suppose , but i &apos;ll take the money .
you won .
yes , but it was a good game .
fbi ! you &apos;re under arrest !
haustenberg was her father .
yes .
she was his illegitimate daughter ,
but he had a family then in hungary .
it was before the war .
how did the painting end up at the channing ?
he willed the painting to my grandmother ,
but when he died , the museum chose to ignore his will .
who cares about the illegitimate daughter of a famous artist ?
it &apos;s not theft when rich men do it .
how do you know that the channing
won &apos;t try to take it back again ?
because if they do , the curator will have to explain
why the museum went against haustenberg &apos;s wishes ,
and ... i don &apos;t think he wants that .
neal , what have you done ?
problem ?
