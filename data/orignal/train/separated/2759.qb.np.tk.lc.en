all right ! you guys , it &apos;s starting to snow .
and look , ugly naked guy is hanging candy canes .
where ?
oh . well .
that &apos;s festive .
guys , there &apos;s somebody i &apos;d like you to meet .
wait , wait . what is that ?
that &apos;s marcel . wanna say hi ?
no , i don &apos;t .
he &apos;s cute ! where &apos;d you get him ?
my friend bethel saved him from a lab .
that is so cruel .
why would a parent name their child bethel ?
that monkey &apos;s got a ross on his ass .
is he gonna live with you in your apartment ?
yeah . it &apos;s been kind of quiet since carol left .
why not get a roommate ?
you reach a certain age , having a roommate is just kind of pathet
that &apos;s &quot; pathet . &quot; sanskrit for &quot; really cool way to live . &quot;
the one with the monkey
i &apos; m doing new material tonight .
i have 1.2 songs about my mother &apos;s suicide and one about a snowman .
you might wanna open with the snowman .
hi , joey .
hey , buddy .
so how &apos;d it go ?
i didn &apos;t get the job .
how could you not ? you were santa last year .
some fat guy &apos;s sleeping with the store manager .
he &apos;s not even jolly . it &apos;s all political .
what are you gonna be ?
one of his helpers .
it &apos;s just such a slap in the face , you know ?
do you know what you &apos; re doing for new year &apos;s ?
hey , what ? what is wrong with new year &apos;s ?
you have paolo . you don &apos;t have to face the pressure ...
... of finding lips to kiss when the ball drops !
man , i &apos;m talking loud !
paolo &apos;s gonna be in rome this new year &apos;s .
i &apos;ll be just as pathetic as you .
yeah , you wish .
i &apos;ve got an idea . dinner .
it &apos;s perfect . we &apos;ll put it between lunch and breakfast .
i &apos;m sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday .
i say this year , we make a pact . just the six of us . dinner .
sure .
fine .
i was hoping for more enthusiasm .
phoebe , you &apos; re on .
oh , good .
hi . ladies and gentlemen , back by popular demand ...
... miss phoebe buffay .
hi . thanks . hi .
i wanna start with a song that means a lot to me .
i made a man with eyes of coal
and a smile so bewitching
how was i supposed to know
that my mom was dead in the kitchen ?
my mother &apos;s ashes
even her eyelashes
are resting in a little yellow jar
and sometimes when it &apos;s freezing
i feel a little sneezy
and now i excuse me ? excuse me ? yeah , noisy boys .
is it something you &apos;d like to share with the group ?
no . no , that &apos;s okay .
if it &apos;s important enough while i &apos;m playing ...
... it &apos;s important enough for everyone else .
that guy &apos;s going home with a note .
i was just saying
speak up .
sorry , l
i was saying you were the most beautiful woman i &apos;d ever seen .
and he said that daryl hannah ...
... was the most beautiful woman he &apos;d ever seen .
i said i liked her in splash , but not wall street .
i thought she had a hard quality .
while daryl is beautiful in a conventional way ...
... you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace .
then that &apos;s when you started yelling .
we &apos;re gonna take a short break .
that guy &apos;s going home with more than a note .
come here , marcel . sit here .
i can &apos;t believe he hasn &apos;t kissed you yet .
by my sixth date with paolo , he &apos;d already named both my breasts .
did i just share too much ?
just a smidge .
david &apos;s , like , a scientist guy . he &apos;s very methodical .
i think it &apos;s romantic .
me too !
did you ever see an officer and a gentleman ?
he &apos;s kind of like the guy i went to see that with .
except he &apos;s smarter and gentler and sweeter .
i just wanna be with him all the time .
you know , day and night . and night and day .
and special occasions .
i see . you &apos;re gonna ask him to new year &apos;s .
she &apos;s gonna break the pact .
no ! no , no .
no . yeah , could i just ?
yeah . i already asked janice .
what ?
this was a pact ! this was your pact !
i couldn &apos;t handle the pressure . i snapped !
but that was the worst breakup in history !
i &apos;m not saying it was a good idea . i snapped !
hi , sorry i &apos;m late .
too many jokes .
must mock joey .
nice shoes , huh ?
god , you &apos;re killing me !
ross , he &apos;s playing with my spatulas again !
he &apos;s not gonna hurt them , right ?
do you always have to bring him ?
i didn &apos;t wanna leave him alone . we had our first fight this morning .
it has to do with my working late . i said some things that i didn &apos;t mean .
he threw some feces .
if you &apos;re working late , i can look in on him .
that would be great !
but make sure it seems like you &apos;re there to see him .
you &apos;re not doing it for me .
okay . but if he asks , i &apos;m not going to lie .
but you can &apos;t actually test this theory .
t oday &apos;s particle accelerators aren &apos;t powerful enough ...
... to simulate these conditions .
i have a question then .
yeah ? -do you plan on kissing me ever ?
that &apos;s definitely a valid question , and the answer ...
... would be yes . yes , i was .
but i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss ...
... at a phenomenal moment because it &apos;s you .
sure .
the longer i waited , the more phenomenal the kiss had to be .
now , it &apos;s just gotta be one of those things where l ...
... sweep everything off the table .
and i &apos;m not really a sweeping sort of fella .
david , i think you are a sweeping sort of fella .
i mean , you &apos;re a sweeper trapped inside a physicist &apos;s body .
really ?
i &apos;m sure .
you should just do it . just throw me .
now ?
yeah , right now . just ....
okay . okay . okay .
you know what ? this is really expensive .
and this was a gift .
now you &apos; re just tidying up .
okay .
you want me to throw you ?
i can hop .
t ell me something , what does &quot; no @-@ date pact &quot; mean to you ?
it &apos;s just that chandler and phoebe have somebody .
i thought i &apos;d ask fun bobby .
your ex @-@ boyfriend ?
yeah .
you know more than one fun bobby ?
i happen to know a fun bob .
okay . here we go .
there &apos;s no room for milk .
there . now there is .
so on our no @-@ date evening , three of you now have dates .
four .
five .
sorry . paolo &apos;s catching an earlier flight .
and i met this really hot single mom at the store .
what &apos;s an elf to do ?
so i &apos;ll be the only one alone when the ball drops ?
we &apos;ll have a big party , and no one will know who &apos;s with who .
i &apos;ll know . this is so not what i needed right now .
what &apos;s the matter ?
oh , it &apos;s marcel .
he &apos;s angry with me . i have no idea why . he keeps shutting me out .
he &apos;s walking around all the time , dragging his hands .
that &apos;s weird . i had a blast with him .
really ?
we played , watched tv .
that juggling thing is amazing .
what juggling thing ?
with the socks ? i figured you taught him that .
no .
it wasn &apos;t that big a deal . just socks . and a melon .
phoebe !
max . do you know everybody ?
no . have you seen david ?
he hasn &apos;t been around .
if you see him , tell him to pack . we are going to minsk .

it &apos;d be even more exciting if we were going .
oh , you &apos;re not going ? oh , why ?
t ell her . &quot; i don &apos;t wanna go ...
... to work with lipson , yamaguchi and flank .
i wanna stay and make out with my girlfriend ! &quot;

this is how you greet guests ?
if i showed up with my new girlfriend , she wouldn &apos;t be welcome ?

... when this woman , this blond planet with a pocketbook ...
... starts yelling . something about how it was her cab first .
the next thing , she just starts pulling me out by my hair !
and i was blowing my attack whistle thingy ...
... and three more cabs show up .
so as i &apos;m going to get into a cab , she tackles me !
and i hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle .
