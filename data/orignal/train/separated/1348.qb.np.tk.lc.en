hey ! what the hell ? !
no ! what are you -- leave me alone !
looks like uncle silvio &apos;s third wedding in here .
you &apos;re just in time . dinner is due any second .
guess where from .
i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s not the pizza and beer i was hoping for .
le petit maison .
they have the best escargot in boston .
snails ?
escar @-@ gross .
think of it as a garlic and butter delivery system .
since when did you start liking fancy french food ?
i don &apos;t know if i like it or not .
i just , uh , wanted to thank maura for all her generosity
over these last couple of years .
so this is your fault .
if you mean introducing a refined cuisine
to a curious palate , then yes , i &apos;m guilty as charged .
i think it &apos;s wonderful that angela &apos;s expanding her horizon .
yeah . i &apos;m free , i &apos;m single , i got a new job ,
and it &apos;s time i started to live it up a little .
don &apos;t worry , jane .
i &apos;m making more money now than i ever did .
and i got three new credit cards this week .
yes , but , mom , you do realize that you have to
pay those off with real money , right ?
here you go .
what is it ? it &apos;s ... blackberry ,
with a hint of ...
coffee bean .
that was not the backup i was looking for .
i have a weakness for a good bordeaux .
rizzoli .
dr. isles .
come on !
we &apos;ll be right there .
we -- i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . ma , we can take it to go .
no , no , no , no , no .
escargot does not travel , but it does reheat .
thank you , angela .
thanks , ma .
angela , party for one ,
your table is ready .
ma &apos;s been spending like crazy ever since she got that job .
if she doesn &apos;t knock it off , she &apos;s gonna end up bankrupt
or living on the street .
or even worse , with me .
all angela needs is a good financial system
to manage her new income .
well , can you talk to her about that ?
the only financial system i use is to carry cash ...
and a gun .
i can give her some pointers if you think it will help .
yes , please . hey , what do we got ?
uh , the victim is dylan blyer .
he and his wife own mamaki clothing .
they design and sell socially conscious clothes ,
whatever that means .
it &apos;s an emphasis on global responsibility .
you know , paying a living wage to workers
and utilizing sustainable materials .
could be that they are importing their cotton
from villages in africa , which helps the
locals support themselves ,
stopping the cycle of poverty .
well , his employees couldn &apos;t say enough good things about him .
got along with everyone ,
no conflicts , no personal issues .
plus , he was a real visionary .
committed to the business and to helping people .
well , how did such a nice guy end up like this ?
well , the sales guy said that he heard an argument upstairs ,
and then dylan fell off the ledge .
there &apos;s blood @-@ stained foam from the nose and the lips .
the skin has a bluish @-@ gray tint .
that wasn &apos;t caused by the fall .
looks like somebody searched through the desk .
well , the store was locked
and there was no sign of forced entry .
but a neighbor did notice a panel van speeding away
around the time of death .
they get a plate ?
only a partial .
i put out a b.o.l.o.
have c.s.r.u. check the computer ,
see if any files were downloaded .
all right , so what do we think we &apos;re looking at here ?
the -- the owner comes back unexpectedly ,
finds somebody searching his office ?
burglary gone bad ?
yeah , but the burglar wasn &apos;t looking for cash .
he took some files , possibly searched the computer .
corporate espionage .
let &apos;s find out everything we can about the company --
who works here , how much money they make .
see if anybody has any secrets worth stealing .
i haven &apos;t been able to contact zoe blyer .
the victim &apos;s wife ?
yeah . i left messages on her cell numbers and home numbers .
had uniforms stop by their apartment . nothing .
so one owner of the company is dead ,
and the other owner is missing .
i &apos;ll have frankie go to the office ,
ask around , see if anybody knows where we might find her .
i &apos;m not supposed to say anything , but ...
i heard he failed his firearms qualifications test .
my frankie ? that &apos;s impossible .
evidently not .
no , he &apos;s -- he &apos;s a great shot . i taught him myself .
maybe he needs a refresher .
he &apos;s only got two more chances to pass
or he &apos;ll get suspended .
additional subendocardial hemorrhages
in the left ventricle .
i thought you &apos;d want to know right away .
the fall didn &apos;t kill dylan blyer .
okay .
actual cause of death was poisoning .
no needle marks , so it &apos;s likely he ingested it .
any idea what it was ?
it &apos;s from the phenethylamine family .
but i &apos;ve never seen this exact combination .
we &apos;ll know soon , though .
yes , we will !
is the phen @-@ ethel merman fairy gonna tell you ?
i &apos;m afraid not , but it is the perfect test run
for our bio @-@ orbitron ms @-@ 8000 mass spectrometer .
it &apos;s being delivered today .
it is the most advanced chemical analyzer in the world .
ultrahigh resolution .
recombinant glycoprotein characterizations .
oh , my gosh .
remember when you girls got that new d.n.a. splicer
and you talked about it for weeks ?
this is even more boring than that !
hey , jane . we just got a hit off the b.o.l.o. for that van .
okay .
have fun with your new toy .
looks like the right van . but a plumbing company ?
i don &apos;t know about that .
you smell that ?
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s coming from inside .
zoe blyer &apos;s still missing .
hey ! get the hell outta there !
put your hands in the air . boston p.d.
don &apos;t shoot .
what &apos;s in the bags ?
garbage .
you can &apos;t arrest me for picking up garbage .
if it &apos;s outside , i can take it . it &apos;s totally legal .
yeah , i &apos;m sure there &apos;s something in those bags
we can arrest you for .
this van was seen fleeing a crime scene last night .
yeah .
i.d. ?
yeah , i &apos;m going for my i.d. don &apos;t shoot .
what were you doing there ?
making our lives harder .
oh , good . he &apos;s a p.i.
we found the contents of dylan blyer &apos;s desk in your van .
right . it &apos;s part of my investigation .
well , ours , too ,
since it seems like you were there when he died .
fine . i was there , but i had nothing to do with it .
he came in acting all crazy ,
like he was tripping on something .
then he started screaming at me .
he stumbled backwards , went over the rail .
and -- and i tried to grab him , but he just went over .
no , no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s a nice story .
what about this ?
blyer surprised you in his office .
he threatened to call the cops ,
and you pushed him over rail to shut him up .
i like my story better &apos; cause it &apos;s what happened .
look , i swear .
i didn &apos;t touch the guy .
you &apos;ve been following him for the past two weeks .
who hired you ?
i don &apos;t give up my clients . confidentiality issues .
you know that privilege doesn &apos;t extend to p.i.s.
so if you &apos;d like to add obstruction to your --
blyer &apos;s wife .
why &apos;d she hire you ?
she thought he was having an affair .
was he ?
it seemed like it .
i mean , he was acting all kinds of shady --
sneaking around , lying about where he was going .
did you ever see him with another woman ?
i wish .
do you know the bonus i get for a money shot like that ?
divorce attorneys love me .
and the more naked , the better .
no .
i didn &apos;t . that &apos;s why i was in his office .
i @-@ i was having no luck trailing him .
i mean , he eats at the same vegan restaurant for lunch ,
and he goes to the same yoga place every afternoon .
and i had to find something .
you know , e @-@ mail , a love letter .
which is why i visited his office .
which is why you broke into his office .
well , the client gave me the key , so ...
technically , it &apos;s a gray area .
when &apos;s the last time you spoke to zoe ?
last night .
i called her to tell her dylan was dead .
she seem surprised ?
now that you mention it ,
not so much .
c.s.r.u. finished processing the van .
they brought everything that p.i. gathered
into the conference room .
well , not the garbage , just everything that was relevant .
all right , well , jerry jankowski &apos;s client
was zoe blyer .
she thought dylan was having an affair .
well , he might not have been as squeaky @-@ lean
as his employees thought .
yeah , neither was she .
she had two drug convictions when she was younger .
well , maybe it &apos;s not about the business after all .
jealousy &apos;s a powerful motive .
and she hasn &apos;t been seen or heard from since he died .
nothing on her a.t.m. or credit cards ?
no , and she hasn &apos;t used her cell phone .
all right , i &apos;ll put out an a.p.b. ,
and i &apos;ll have frankie go through the p.i. &apos; s stuff
to see if we can place zoe and dylan together
on the day of the murder .
yeah , i &apos;ll do it .
frankie &apos;s down at the firing range practicing ,
and from what i hear , he needs it .
did jane put you up to this ?
she only wants to help .
i can handle my own money ... just fine .
of course . of course . but with income from the new job ,
it might help to just establish some rules for yourself .
rules ?
like ...
practicing restraint .
not splurging on expensive items .
and i have a few strategies of my own i can share with you .
do any of these &quot; strategies &quot;
have to do with what &apos;s in your &quot; study closet &quot; ?
study closet ?
i &apos;m not sure i understand .
oh , you understand perfectly well .
maybe there &apos;s a chapter in here that deals with splurging .
or not splurging , as the case may be .
i know talking about money is difficult ,
but it is also important .
i have customers .
so do i.
well , bodies .
i &apos;ll see you at home .
and we can talk about this then .
or not . we can see how we feel .
hey , that was better .
yeah ?
yeah .
how &apos;s my grip ?
look , try to just use the two middle fingers .
okay ? like that . all right , now slowly ...
squeeze .
good .
keep practicing .
will do !
you failed your shooting test on purpose ? !
what ? no way .
well , either that or you &apos;re going blind ,
which , from the way you were staring at her ass ,
i can see is not the case .
it &apos;s no big deal . okay ?
i @-@ i just needed a reason
to have a couple of lessons with the new firearms instructor .
alexandra .
i mean , did you see her ?
this is sad on so many levels .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna ace the next test . don &apos;t worry .
hey , i am just saying you &apos;re new to boston ,
and i could show you places
that you will not find in the guidebook .
stop talking .
oh , have you ever had razor clams ?
you charge people for this nonsense ?
&quot; 10 : 00 p.m. -- dirty abused hobbits &quot; ?
it &apos;s a code .
&quot; dirty abused hobbits . &quot; d.a.h.
&quot; dylan arrives home . &quot;
you messing with me ?
no . see , that way , they can &apos;t force me to testify .
pretty smart , right ?
you told detective rizzoli
you called zoe blyer right after the murder .
i checked her cell records . no call from you .
i don &apos;t call my clients &apos; cell phones .
i give &apos; em burner cells because they can &apos;t be traced .
of course they can .
they can ?
what &apos;s the number ?
um , okay .
uh , first time i met her , golden szechuan palace .
i got it .
you and me , our minds are like one .
not even a little bit .
i &apos;ll run the number , let you know when we find her .
am i right ?
i &apos;m at the address now .
the cell pinged from that location less than a half @-@ hour ago .
backup &apos;s on the way now .
tell them she &apos;s on the move .
zoe blyer ?
hey . boston police ! i just wanna talk to you !
no !
no ! stay !
stay away !
drop your weapon !
hold on ! hold your fire !
zoe , now we just wanna talk to you about dylan .
he &apos;s dead .
i know .
put the gun down . we don &apos;t wanna hurt you .
no , no , they killed him .
zoe , i wanna help you ,
but you have to drop the gun .
please .
help me ...
or they &apos;re gonna kill me , too .
all right .
okay .
easy .
easy . easy .
who are you running from ?
i don &apos;t know . dylan warned me we were in danger .
from who ?
he wouldn &apos;t say .
come on , zoe . we know that you hired a p.i.
because you thought that dylan was having an affair .
must &apos;ve made you angry .
sometimes we do crazy things when we &apos;re angry .
i was hurt , not angry .
were you using again ?
what ? no .
i &apos;ve been clean for seven years , thanks to dylan .
i wouldn &apos;t have made it without him .
you think i killed him ?
you tell us .
i would never hurt dylan .
i was just confused .
he always talked to me about everything .
then one day , he started shutting me out .
when was the last time you spoke with him ?
the day he died .
he told me he was out of town on business .
the investigator e @-@ mailed me pictures of him
at some cheap motel here in boston .
i called him and i accused him of horrible things .
who did you think he was having an affair with ?
our account renee .
he &apos;d been meeting with her a lot .
and he denied it ?
he swore he wasn &apos;t cheating .
he told me he got mixed up with some dangerous people ,
and the less i knew , the better .
but he had some kind of evidence
that would make everything right again .
did he say what that was ?
no .
jerry called and told me dylan was dead .
and i realized ...
he &apos;d been telling me the truth , and we really were in danger .
so you went into hiding .
i should &apos;ve trusted him .
i should &apos;ve believed in him like he always believed in me .
you look like someone just drowned your puppy .
i just ... i failed my shooting test .
again .
you know what ?
you keep screwing around , you &apos;re gonna regret it .
that &apos;s the thing . i really tried this time .
it &apos;s alexandra .
she was standing so close to me , i couldn &apos;t focus .
all i could think about was coming up with the perfect line
to ask her out .
how about , &quot; the only thing i love more than a woman in uniform
is a woman out of uniform &quot; ? that &apos;s always a winner .
i &apos;m serious . tomorrow could be my last chance .
you have to come and -- and keep her away from me .
what ? ! no !
yes .
fine .
this is what you get for thinking with your ... gun .
i understand you were the only account for mamaki since it started ?
that &apos;s right . i handle most of their financial affairs .
dylan and zoe are more visionaries than businesspeople .
were there any issues ?
cash flow problems ? anything like that ?
not for a long time .
the first couple years were difficult ,
but it &apos;s been going well for a while .
what turned things around ?
dylan &apos;s passion .
he believed in his company &apos;s mission ,
and he made his investors believe in it , too .
dylan visited your office several times last week .
how did you know that ?
we have a source . about all i can say now .
a source .
i see .
well , i came down here because i wanted to help ,
but now i &apos;m wondering if i should have an attorney present .
our source is a private investigator .
zoe blyer hired him to follow dylan
because she thought he might be having an affair .
with you , actually .
no . no .
dylan would never cheat on zoe .
he loved her .
and he &apos;s the most honest person i know .
if there weren &apos;t any problems , why so many visits ?
he was considering an expansion into new york ,
and i thought he might be moving too fast .
i still can &apos;t believe he &apos;s gone .
well , we are doing everything we can to figure out what happened .
if you could provide the company &apos;s books ,
that might be helpful .
of course .
dylan was amazing .
he didn &apos;t deserve this .
hello , tall , shiny , and handsome .
and he doesn &apos;t leave the toilet seat up .
jane rizzoli , i would like you to meet
bio @-@ orbitron ms @-@ 8000 .
this things costs more than i make in a year , doesn &apos;t it ?
it costs more than everyone makes in a year .
speaking of , how &apos;d the conversation go with my mom ?
not as well as i &apos;d hoped .
angela &apos;s by resistant to advice on financial matters .
she &apos;s resistant to everything . i &apos;ll talk to her .
no .
i mean , um , you know , who knows what she &apos;ll say ?
she hasn &apos;t said anything to you , has she ?
about what ?
well , about ... i don &apos;t know . um , investments or ... closets .
closets ?
never mind . okay .
so i did a comprehensive analysis on the poison .
the reason wasn &apos;t able to identify it
is because it &apos;s from an entirely new synthetic hallucinogenic .
a drug ? what , like l.s.d. ?
it &apos;s more like similar to the newer designer drugs ,
like m.d.m.a. and 2c @-@ i , that are on the rave scene now .
so our victim oded ?
technically , yes .
he had a massive amount in his system --
six times the normal dosage level .
well , that can &apos;t be accidental .
well , how hard is it for somebody to give him that much ?
well , it &apos;s odorless , tasteless ,
undetectable in food and drink .
i will be able to pinpoint the time he ingested it shortly .
i also remembered something .
there was a similar death
in amherst a few months ago .
a student oded on an unidentified hallucinogenic drug .
so i ran the chemical analysis through the database
and found three other cases --
one in providence
and two in georgetown .
wait a second . can you pull up those crime scene photos ?
of course .
there . that one .
zoom in on that .
amherst , providence , and georgetown .
mamaki sells their clothes
in every city where you found that drug .
you think the company is being used as a cover
for a distribution ring ?
if it is ,
then the people dylan was involved with are drug dealers ,
and whatever evidence he collected
may be what got him killed .
i talked to narcotics .
there &apos;s a new designer drug called viper
that &apos;s hit the college scene .
that may be the same drug that killed dylan blyer .
have any idea who &apos;s behind it ?
no , but landry &apos;s gonna check with his c.i.s
and see what they know .
what &apos;d you find at the motel ?
blyer requested the same room every time he stayed here .
was he meeting drug connections there ?
manager said that he stayed alone and never had any visitors .
you know what ? it -- it doesn &apos;t feel right ,
him dealing in drugs . he hated drugs .
he kept his wife clean for years .
look at this . this is the worst room in the place ,
but it &apos;s got the best view of that .
hey , jane , are you with nina ?
uh , yeah . hang on a second .
go ahead .
hey , do you have any information on a mamaki distribution warehouse ?
we have a name -- ward logistics .
no address , though . just a p.o. box .
why ? did you find something ?
i don &apos;t know . let me get back to you .
ugh . if i had to look at that many numbers every day ,
i would just lay down and cry .
do you see anything interesting ?
their accountant was right .
mamaki had some committed investors .
several substantial cash contributions
over the last few years , which is strange .
strange is good .
strange is our friend in a murder investigation .
the company wasn &apos;t profitable yet ,
but they kept expanding anyway ,
which made me wonder if maybe those investors
were interested in something else , like drugs .
so i pulled the filing papers on the investors ,
and found out they all lead back
to one anonymous shell corp .
&quot; anonymous &quot; is not our friend .
we need a name .
on it .
can i help you ?
boston p.d. we need to speak to the owner .
i &apos;m stanton ward . can i help you , detectives ?
stanton ward of ward logistics ?
yes .
did you work with dylan blyer ?
oh , that &apos;s right . you must be looking into dylan &apos;s death .
it &apos;s very upsetting .
not just personally .
i mean , he was an exceptional young man ,
but professionally , too .
mamaki is my biggest client .
what did you do for them exactly ?
we &apos;re basically a clearinghouse for everything that comes into
or goes out of mamaki .
they import their cotton from africa .
when it arrives here ,
we deliver it to the manufacturer who make the clothes .
the finished items come back here to be sorted and packaged ,
and then distributed down to the stores .
mr. ward , when &apos;s the last time you saw dylan ?
a week or so ago .
he usually stops by a couple times a month .
so he wasn &apos;t in any time over the last few days ?
uh , it &apos;s been at least a week .
did he seem concerned about anything ?
why ? you got some reason to think that he wasn &apos;t happy ?
do you ?
no .
mind if we take a look around ?
i run a top @-@ notch operation .
we &apos;ve passed every government inspection with flying colors ,
and we &apos;ve never been cited with a violation .
you can look anywhere you like , detectives .
we got nothing to hide .
thank you .
you think blyer was spying on his own distributor ?
if he &apos;s as honest as everybody says he was ,
it &apos;s possible he didn &apos;t know about the drugs .
then somehow he finds out or he gets suspicious ...
so he starts his own investigation ...
which leads him here .
he told zoe he had evidence
that would make everything right .
we need to find what he found .
let &apos;s get a warrant ,
bring some drug dogs down here .
i love dogs .
rizzoli .
jane , i finished testing the drug .
based on the dosage and the victim &apos;s b.m.i. ,
i &apos;d estimate the time of poisoning
to be about two hours prior to the time of death .
of course , that &apos;s an approximation .
it &apos;s impossible to be exact
with a substance we know so little about .
well , that &apos;s good enough . thanks , maura .
detective rizzoli ! you don &apos;t realize
i am a vital part of an ongoing investigation !
what is going on here ?
why aren &apos;t you in your room ?
that &apos;s what i told him .
i was looking for you .
go to your room .
what am i , 6 ?
go to your room this instant !
well , i created a time line , if anybody cares .
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine . i &apos;ve got it .
you did this ?
why so shocked ?
i am a professional just like you .
please . you and i have nothing in common .
what is your problem with me ?
i &apos;m obviously really good at my job .
i &apos;m sure you are .
it &apos;s the way you go about it i have a problem with .
i do what needs to be done .
don &apos;t you do the same thing ?
&apos;cause you seem pretty driven to me .
yeah , but i don &apos;t make up the rules as i go along .
okay ? i believe in --
in right and wrong , in black and white ,
not this gray area that you &apos;re so fond of , no .
i get that . you deal in murder .
good guys and bad guys .
i deal in broken marriages
and cheapskate insurance companies .
everybody thinks they are the good guy .
it &apos;s all one big gray area .
and sometimes ,
i really don &apos;t like it myself .
you know , i was gonna be a cop when i was younger ,
but sadly , that didn &apos;t work out .
am i gonna regret asking why ?
well , i was obviously too good for them .
look at that . you created an alibi for yourself .
yeah . what ? i did ?
this time @-@ stamped receipt with your signature on it .
we know now that dylan was poisoned
two hours before he died .
your time line indicates
that he was at his regular yoga class .
this receipt states that you were clear across town .
so ...
you &apos;re free to go .
yeah . good .
right .
uh ... but if you need me to stay here ,
i can help you with this .
i think we can take it from here .
well , can i get my stuff back ?
no .
that &apos;s cool . that works for me .
wait a second .
these pictures that you took of dylan at the motel --
are you sure they &apos;re in the right order ?
definitely . i checked them twice .
this picture of him leaving the motel at night ,
where &apos;d he go ?
i think he went for a walk .
i didn &apos;t leave the motel because i was hoping
the mystery lady was gonna show up ,
and i did not wanna miss the money shot .
here he leaves the motel with a travel mug .
but here , when he comes back 45 minutes later ,
he doesn &apos;t have it .
maybe he lost it ?
no , no , no . i don &apos;t think so . look ...
5 : 15 the next morning , he leaves the motel empty @-@ handed .
when he comes back , he &apos;s got the travel mug again .
so maybe he found it .
he didn &apos;t find it . he retrieved it .
the mug &apos;s a video camera . he was filming something .
oh , we need to look at that right now .
i need to look at it right now .
you need to go home .
jerry .
nice job .
so you think dylan blyer snuck in at night
and placed a camera ?
and then picked it up the next morning
so he could see what ward had been up to .
here we go .
okay , fast @-@ forward .
can you zoom in ?
there .
looks like they &apos;re importing more than just cotton
from africa .
that &apos;s ward .
i &apos;ll give him this -- he &apos;s a good liar .
well , you can &apos;t really make out what &apos;s in the packages .
no way to prove it &apos;s drugs .
we still got a unit sitting on him ?
yep .
good .
i wanna make sure we can find him
when the dogs are finished with the warehouse .
we should just talk to my mom together .
you know , like a ... financial intervention .
look , why don &apos;t i just handle it ?
&apos;cause you and your mom just argue when you talk about money .
my mother and i argue when we talk about the weather .
you wanted to talk about spending ?
let &apos;s talk .
well , there &apos;s nothing really to discuss .
really ?
and , uh ...
when exactly were you planning on wearing this ?
i don &apos;t know . eventually .
jackie o never goes out of style .
where did all of this come from ?
the study closet .
must be some closet .
yeah , the real question is ,
why is it stuffed in there ?
sometimes ... i shop .
this isn &apos;t shopping , maura .
this is building inventory for your own store .
or zoo .
wally was more of a companion before angela moved in .
okay , you &apos;re dodging the question .
and scaring us .
when i &apos;m stressed out , i like to shop .
it makes me feel better .
i like that everything is new , not dead .
but why are you hiding it ?
because i know i don &apos;t need a pillbox hat
or a giant giraffe .
i just ... need some self @-@ control .
it &apos;s okay to do something extravagant once in a while .
ma , you know , maybe it &apos;s okay for maura .
she &apos;s loaded .
you , on the other hand , you gotta be careful .
why do you have such little faith in me ?
ma , i just worry , that &apos;s all .
you think i &apos;m too dumb to manage my money ?
come on . no .
i ... all right , fine .
when i first joined the force , i ...
i went a little crazy and i racked up
thousands of dollars in credit card bills ,
and it took me years to pay them off .
well , why didn &apos;t you tell me ? i would &apos;ve helped you .
oh , yeah , sure ,
and let you know how badly i screwed ? not a chance .
there &apos;s no place to sit down .
i guess we all have a few financial skeletons in our closets .
i &apos;ll admit .
i did find this one a bit surprising .
maura , it &apos;s a weapon .
it doesn &apos;t have to match your purse .
jane , accessories always have to match .
let me see it .
nope .
okay .
you find anything on stanton ward ?
not much . on paper , he &apos;s clean .
owns several businesses , all legit .
no arrest record ,
no connections to any known criminal organizations .
search of his warehouse with drug dogs came up empty , too .
i did find one thing .
i was running comparisons on ward &apos;s holdings
and the shell corp that invested in mamaki .
did you get a name ?
not for who &apos;s behind the shell corp ,
but a tax return for one of ward &apos;s companies
was filed by his c.p.a. -- renee levinson .
did she tell you she worked
for both dylan blyer and stanton ward ?
she most certainly did not .
there .
see ? look at you go with your girly gun .
elegant , stylish ,
and extremely effective .
you &apos;re right . this does help to relieve stress .
right ? so much better than shopping , huh ?
it &apos;s ... louder .
you know if you ever get stressed out about something ,
you can just come talk to me .
i know . i ...
uh , sometimes i forget that
i don &apos;t have to solve all of my problems on my own .
well , what &apos;s the fun of having friends if you can &apos;t
bitch and complain to them whenever you want to ?
oh , i thought the point was that we were supposed to
support each other through positive reinforcement .
y @-@ yeah , that . but the bitching and complaining is so much fun .
okay , we gotta go save frankie from his hormones .
what ? that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
i have to run interference .
frankie &apos;s got the hots for the new firearms instructor .
he wants to ask her out .
really ? alexandra ?
hey .
hey !
hi !
so nice to see you again , alexandra .
you , too .
how are the wife and kids ?
oh , we &apos;re great , thanks . julie &apos;s loving the new house .
lots more room for the boys to play .
oh . well ...
seriously ?
that was excellent .
i knew you could do it .
good job , bud !
hmm . oh , i @-@ i &apos;m sure i mentioned it .
you didn &apos;t .
well , yes ...
i &apos;ve occasionally done a little work
for mr. ward over the years .
what else didn &apos;t you tell us about ?
i mean , what about these investors ?
you had to know those were bogus .
all that cash being invested into mamaki .
stanton ward was behind that , wasn &apos;t he ?
i really wish that i could help ,
but i &apos;m just an accountant .
i @-@ i do the books and -- and i offer advice occasionally ,
but that &apos;s all .
you told me you handled most of mamaki &apos;s business affairs .
which is it , renee ?
i @-@ i may have overstated my involvement before .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
i think you were involved up to your eyeballs
and now you &apos;re scared .
i think you need to take this .
rizzoli .
did you forget how to answer your phone ?
jerry ?
look , i &apos;m being followed .
look , i know that you wanna be a part of this , but--
just turn on facetime ! hurry up !
see ?
i told you i wasn &apos;t making it up !
where are you ?
hey , hey , come on . you want some of this ? !
try and get a location .
hey , guys , come on . jane , help !
jerry !
help !
i really wish i could help .
your buddy ward just kidnapped a private investigator
that zoe blyer hired .
what ?
you told ward about him , didn &apos;t you ?
i ...
i promise you ,
if anything happens to this guy ,
and i find out that you didn &apos;t tell us everything you know ,
you will go down for this .
we still have uniform with him , right ?
i already called . he gave him the slip .
where would ward take him ?
i don &apos;t know .
look , renee , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re a bad person ,
but you &apos;re in a very bad situation
and you need to make it right .
i never knew about the drugs , i swear .
and-- and i begged dylan not to confront stanton .
renee , think .
you know ward &apos;s other businesses .
is there anywhere else , anywhere where ward would take him ?
he owns a body shop . um , the fenway collision center .
it &apos;s not registered in his name .
i want those recordings .
why do you think i have &apos; em ?
&apos;cause my guys looked everywhere else .
and i know you &apos;re the last one
to see that bleeding heart blyer alive .
i give it to you , you &apos;ll just kill me .
i &apos;ll kill you if you don &apos;t .
i hid &apos; em .
and if something happens to me ,
it goes right to the cops .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re that smart .
not a sound .
last chance before i start shooting holes in you .
well , that seems a bit extreme .
whatever happened to breaking fingers ?
let -- let &apos;s go old school .
god , i &apos;m tired of your mouth .
stop . stop . stop . stop .
you know what your first mistake was ?
you should &apos;ve got the recording before you poisoned blyer .
i mean , if i gotta be honest with you ,
it &apos;s really an amateur move on your part .
i &apos;m not an amateur . we followed blyer .
we knew he took that same yoga class every day .
we put enough viper in his water bottle to kill a horse .
and i would &apos;ve had all night to find those recordings
if you hadn &apos;t taken them .
guess i really screwed things up for you , huh ?
well , do i have to have him sign the confession , too ?
boston homicide . put your hands in the air .
who &apos;s the smart one now ?
you all right ?
uh , i am a little banged up ,
but it &apos;s not the first time .
thanks for getting him to confess .
yeah . i think we &apos;re a great team .
you know , rizzoli &amp; jankowski .
no .
thank you for finding me .
any time .
stay out of trouble , okay ?
uh , hey . i don &apos;t suppose there &apos;s a reward for this , right ?
all right , forget about it .
look , i &apos;m just happy helping boston &apos;s finest .
i don &apos;t know about p.i.s.
never feel like i can trust them .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s kind of a gray area .
okay , this is the &quot; return &quot; pile ,
and that is the &quot; donation &quot; pile .
and this is an &quot; angela &quot; pile .
okay , i thought we weren &apos;t gonna go crazy
with the foo @-@ foo dinners anymore .
yes , uh , but angela had a point ,
that every now and then ,
we deserve to treat ourselves to something fancy .
you &apos;re taking her side now ?
stop worrying .
i cut up two of the credit cards ,
and the one i kept , i &apos;m gonna pay off every month .
you could stand a little crazy once in a while yourself .
between my job and my family ,
i got enough crazy for anybody .
right , wally ?
oh , no , jane , you &apos;re taking it too far .
do not make him take sides .
okay , but , ma , you gotta promise that you won &apos;t --
whoa ! is that risotto ?
from turturro &apos;s .
but don &apos;t feel like you have to eat it .
i mean , if it &apos;s too expensive for you ...
caprese ! and ...
pesto gnocchi !
yes .
i love pesto !
well , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s like i always say--
what &apos;s-- what &apos;s the point in making money
if you &apos;re not gonna treat yourself , right ?
i think you would get in a program .
oh , no , no . don &apos;t -- you can &apos;t eat it out of the plastic .
why not ?
put it on a plate .
what ?
stop her . stop her .
