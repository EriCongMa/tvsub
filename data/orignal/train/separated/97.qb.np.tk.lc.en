第五季第三集
we should replace her .
i can &apos;t fire someone because they &apos;re too pretty .
then don &apos;t . promote her . move her laterally .
i &apos;m in .
with agos , florrick .
florrick , agos .
look , we can &apos;t keep skulking around .
we have to cut the cord at some point .
people want to wait for bonuses .
an interview ?
on what subject ?
there will be questions about will .
peter really needs you to get the chief justice on your side .
so i trash will , or i &apos;m not nominated ?
my life is taken up with client maintenance these days .
why is everybody so unhappy ?
i gave an interview to the law advocate .
just now .
i talked about you .
okay .
they asked about your suspension .
no , i @-@ i talked about your suspension .
what did you say ?
that we were lucky .
we thought you were going to be ... disbarred .
i talked about the money .
the $ 45,000 that you took .
how we agreed that it was wrong .
why ?
the chief justice would only support my judgeship
if i made a clear statement .
you talked about the money ?
i was sitting there and i realized ...
i ... i &apos;m sorry .
i was wrong . the interv ...
ms. lockhart ?
ms. lockhart , lisa asked me to give you a message .
eli gold called and wanted you to know :
don &apos;t worry about giving the interview .
he found another way .
and you have said , mr. florrick ,
that your governorship will be the most ethical
in the history of illinois .
i mean , that &apos;s a bit of a low bar , isn &apos;t it ?
given that four of the last eight
governors have been to prison ?
well , i &apos;ve already been to prison myself ,
so i guess i &apos;m pre @-@ inoculated .
that &apos;s good .
so why don &apos;t we try one
with you two kissing arm in arm ?
oh , no , that &apos;s all right .
just for variety .
no .
these are good .
shall i bring in the children ?
mrs. florrick , can you address
the rumors that you two are still living
in separate apartments ?
i can . my career is here in chicago ,
and peter &apos;s is in chicago and springfield ,
so we have residences in both . we use both .
so when you &apos;re both in town , you stay together ?
anne .
what ? that is a fair question , eli .
yes , we do .
in fact , i understand that you &apos;re taking a week off
to go to hawaii to renew your vows .
okay , anne , are those really the issues that we want
to be talking about ?
well , there is concern that you are handpicking members
of the ethics commission ,
replacing good people with yes @-@ men .
really ? concern ? from whom ?
well , you fired marilyn garbanza ,
one of the most widely respected ethical watchdogs
in the quinn administration .
alicia florrick .
alicia , it &apos;s kathy .
i &apos;m not calling for me . it &apos;s for tara .
oh , kathy , hi . is everything all right ?
no . there &apos;s been a complication .
we &apos;re at dr. tuft &apos;s office , and tara &apos;s headed over here now .
can you come ? i think she &apos;ll need you .
sure . are you okay ?
i &apos;ll see you in a minute .
zach , where &apos;s your sister ? i have to head out .
she &apos;s right there .
grace ?
mom , hey .
oh , grandma got it for me .
do you like it ?
it &apos;s ... wow .
is that a good wow ?
it &apos;s a &quot; you don &apos;t look like yourself &quot; wow .
yes .
mr. gardner , this is mandy post .
i &apos;m fact @-@ checking an article
i &apos;m writing about your partner , diane lockhart .
and i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .
sure . go for it .
have you stolen any more money from clients since the $ 45,000
you took ten years ago ?
actually , that &apos;s another call , ms. post .
can i call you back ?
certainly .
kalinda , i need you
to look into diane &apos;s work on her cases .
what am i looking for ?
any lapses . any complaints .
anything she mishandled .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . i just need it done .
wait .
diane hurt us with an interview .
we need to ask her to step away from the firm .
and you need her lapses ?
in case it grows contentious .
will , one thing i know ,
you look into her lapses , it will grow contentious .
i need it by tomorrow .
tara . hmm ?
alicia , there you are .
is it another amnio ?
&apos;cause i have class in , like , an hour .
uh , no , i think there &apos;s been some complications .
oh . are kathy and brian here ?
yes , they called me .
red vine ?
no , thank you .
i wasn &apos;t sure after the first amniocentesis ,
that &apos;s why i requested a second .
the screening detected an 85 % likelihood
of patau syndrome .
it &apos;s a chromosomal abnormality .
it &apos;s very rare .
and i &apos;m sorry , but very severe .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a surfeit of chromosomes .
most babies with patau survive only a few days after birth .
and some less than a year .
all have major developmental disabilities .
but i don &apos;t get it .
i felt him kicking .
last night , all night .
and he will continue to kick .
there &apos;s nothing anyone did wrong , tara .
this is not about the surrogacy .
and what do we do now ?
well , that &apos;s why i wanted to get to you as early as possible ,
so you &apos;ll have options .
you &apos;re in the second trimester , so ... termination
is still a possibility .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we &apos;ll pay for everything .
not just the clinic , but the full amount for the surrogacy .
it &apos;s okay .
no , tara , you &apos;re part of this family now .
we &apos;ll deal with this together .
dr. tuft suggested a clinic .
we &apos;ll make an appointment .
and i &apos;ll go with you .
no , it &apos;s fine .
um , will , can i call you back ?
actually , we need you
for an emergency committee meeting .
we &apos;re short of a quorum .
how far away are you ?
ten minutes , but i &apos;m with a client .
come to the office but go to empty floor on 16th .
make it when you can .
of course , the governor @-@ elect chooses his own commission .
i &apos;ll call you back .
ethics commission ?
it &apos;ll die down .
they &apos;re just probing for a chink in the armor .
i don &apos;t think so . bring marilyn back .
peter , that will look just as weak .
no , i made a mistake .
it looks like i replaced her
because she was too ethical ,
not because of how she looked .
bring her back .
ah , here &apos;s our quorum . how &apos;d you come here , by bicycle ?
what size exit package are we talking about here ?
that &apos;s what we have to discuss .
well , if she damaged the firm , i say
discount whatever that amount ...
with overhead .
i got a call from ...
what &apos;s going on ?
diane .
... charlotte clapton ,
one of my biggest divorces .
she got a call from this reporter
who wanted to fact @-@ check her article .
diane , is out for herself .
so cut her off .
no , we negotiate an exit package .
what happened ?
diane gave an interview that exposed the firm to criticism .
we &apos;re getting calls from clients .
we vote . how many want diane gone ?
she wants herself gone .
we just ask her to leave two months early .
all those in favor of negotiating
diane &apos;s exit package , raise your hand .
who &apos;s taking minutes ?
it @-@ it doesn &apos;t matter . we just count .
eight to six .
good . appointments to the negotiating committee ?
i appoint myself .
you can &apos;t appoint yourself .
i appoint david lee .
i appoint howard lyman and will .
and i appoint alicia .
no . thank you , though .
we need someone who voted against the exit .
you &apos;re the balance .
everybody uses classic roman standard .
we &apos;re not saying anything
if you use a font that everybody else uses .
all of those in favor of the better @-@ looking font .
oh ! i &apos;m joking , i &apos;m joking .
all those in favor of classic roman standard ?
and all those in favor of trajan pro ? congrats .
our law firm now has a font . any new business ?
i heard a rumor i wanted to share with the group .
heard that diane was being pushed out .
the partners got together
and they &apos;re arranging an exit package .
which would leave her clients open for poaching .
if it &apos;s true .
as a partner , i am bound by my confidentiality .
i can &apos;t say anything .
okay . so i &apos;ll count to ten and ,
if you don &apos;t sit down by ten ,
diane is being pushed out . one ...
guys , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t even hint .
well , you did more than hint when you
told us about the partners tracing our texts .
yes . and i &apos;m not so sure that was a good thing .
three , four ...
alicia , we &apos;re two weeks away from leaving .
getting a jump on her clients would mean everything .
six , seven , eight , nine ...
ten .
you can &apos;t read anything into this .
who does diane have as clients ?
ushkov industries .
it &apos;s $ 13 million in billables .
hello .
alicia , what did you say to her ?
what ? uh , kathy ?
yes . what did you tell tara ?
uh , i didn &apos;t say anything . what do you mean ?
she wasn &apos;t at the clinic .
i don &apos;t want to do it .
you don &apos;t want to terminate the pregnancy ?
yeah .
you understand that kathy and brian will feel
like you &apos;re the surrogate in this equation ,
that they &apos;re the parents .
yeah . alicia , i can feel him kicking .
i don &apos;t think he really is what the doctor says he is .
would you like me to set up
another appointment with dr. tuft ?
no , he &apos;ll just say what he said again .
tara , he has birth defects .
i know it feels like he &apos;s healthy ,
but he &apos;ll be in pain when he &apos;s born ,
and he won &apos;t survive .
he has a 15 % chance .
that &apos;s what the doctor said .
that &apos;s not a real chance .
my parents said i had a 10 % chance
of getting into depaul , but i &apos;m here .
tara ...
it &apos;s not your baby .
and you are not my lawyer .
not really .
they &apos;re paying you .
yes , but i represent your interests .
i represent the surrogate &apos;s interests .
then start .
it &apos;s not your decision .
tara .
tara has decided that
in the best interest of the fetus ,
she will carry the baby to term .
excuse me .
this isn &apos;t ...
we talked about this .
i know .
kathy , i can &apos;t .
he &apos;s not sick .
i can feel him .
you &apos;re not a doctor !
okay , hold on .
page 18 of the surrogacy contract , tara ,
you specifically agreed to terminate
if there were substantial signs of birth defects .
yes , tara believes these do not
constitute substantial signs ...
what ? you have got to be kidding me .
tara , this ...
you can &apos;t do this .
kathy , brian , okay .
really ?
and have you explained to her how she will be in breach ?
i have explained to her her options .
we &apos;re paying you , alicia .
she &apos;s not paying you .
yes , and as part of the surrogacy agreement
you agreed to pay me to act in her best interests
during the course of the surrogacy .
tara ...
you &apos;re hurting us .
you don &apos;t agree with tara .
it &apos;s not about what i agree with .
so you &apos;re just cashing a paycheck ?
no ...
i am faithfully representing the interests of my client .
and the interests of your client
involve being the mother of a child with major birth defects ?
no .
ah . so tara wants to give birth ,
and then force my clients to raise the child ?
my client has made the choice not to have ...
no . no .
... an abortion .
you don &apos;t get to use the word &quot; choice &quot; &quot;
that fetus is wholly
my clients &apos; genetic material :
their egg , their sperm .
the only one who gets to choose
is the actual mother .
we would disagree . ah .
and that settles that , then ?
we &apos;re suing . today .
w @-@ wha ... you &apos;re suing for what ?
to force my client to have an abortion ?
how does that work ?
economic devastation .
your client breached her contract .
the isenstadts put over half a million into this surrogacy .
oh , come on .
searching for a surrogate ,
fertility fees , tara &apos;s weekly payments .
a half million is going to bankrupt your client .
unless she decides to honor
the terms of her contract .
then we &apos;ll see you in court .
no , i won &apos;t be seeing you anywhere .
you &apos;re fired .
the isenstadts are terminating
your employment as tara &apos;s lawyer .
well , they can &apos;t do that
until the surrogacy is concluded .
no , they can &apos;t do that
until the contract is concluded ,
and you &apos;ve decided the contract is concluded .
so unless you &apos;re into doing this case pro bono ,
it was nice meeting you .
not in this context .
you put your interests
over the interests of the firm , diane .
this is my firm !
it was your firm .
then get the security guards .
carry me out .
no .
we have enough respect for you
not to make this a public spectacle .
you want to end it this way ?
diane , you ended it .
now , go be a judge .
we have work to do here .
hello .
is grace there ?
no , this is her mother . may i ask who &apos;s calling ?
jimmy lawrence .
she should be back in an hour .
what is this regarding ?
was that for me ?
no , grace .
who &apos;s jimmy lawrence ?
someone from school .
why ?
well , he was calling for grace .
zach , is something going on with your sister ?
no .
but something &apos;s going on ?
zach , what ?
grace has nothing to do with this , mom .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not her .
but grace ...
i don &apos;t understand .
where ... ?
so that &apos;s why this kid is calling ?
lots of kids .
we want you back , marilyn .
yes , i thought that we were
a bit hasty in moving you
to the transit authority board .
promoting me to the transit authority board .
yes , well ,
we heard you weren &apos;t very happy there .
yeah , i didn &apos;t feel ... qualified .
then come back to us .
we &apos;re reorganizing the ethics commission ,
giving it more power .
we &apos;d like you to head it up .
and we &apos;d like to announce today .
in what way , reorganizing ?
well , the ethics commission
has always seemed isolated here in chicago .
we want to move your offices into the governor &apos;s suite
in springfield-- more in the ...
heat of the action .
no , thank you .
wait a minute . wait , whoa , whoa .
why not ?
pat quinn governed from springfield .
rod blagojevich governed from chicago .
each governor is different .
where are you gonna be , mr. florrick ?
oh , he &apos;ll be both here and springfield .
then why are you adding all the offices here ?
i &apos;ll be in chicago .
and you want the ethics offices
isolated out in springfield ?
no , thank you .
what if the offices were here ?
along with unfettered access-- yes , i &apos;d consider it .
no one gets unfettered access .
give us a day to think about it .
okay ?
thank you , mr. florrick .
they hate me , don &apos;t they ?
no , i don &apos;t think they hate you .
they want you to consider all the repercussions .
and they can do that ? take all my money ?
i don &apos;t even have that much .
well , you have
the $ 120,000 coming from your parents &apos; trust when you turn 21 .
they can take that .
excuse me one second , tara .
is that her ? is that the surrogate ?
yes . look , david , i &apos;m doing this pro bono , one of mine .
i will not exceed 30 billable ...
i &apos;m taking first chair with you .
you &apos;re what ?
tara ?
hi . i &apos;m david lee .
i am in awe of your courage , young lady .
life is such a precious commodity ... isn &apos;t it ?
what are you on ?
something for will .
i need you to ... no , come to think of it ,
you &apos;re still friends with cary
and the fourth years , aren &apos;t you ?
what do you need , david ?
no , that &apos;s okay .
robyn , i want you to look into this dr. tuft ...
and you &apos;ve been seeing tara bach for how long ?
i &apos;ve been her ob @-@ gyn for about seven months now .
i see . and when is she due ?
in approximately 12 weeks .
and in your professional opinion ,
is tara &apos;s fetus viable ?
objection , your honor . relevance .
this is a breach of contract suit .
well , let &apos;s find out the relevance .
what &apos;s the relevance , counselor ?
if tara &apos;s fetus is viable , your honor ,
then she can &apos;t abort , and there is no breach of contract .
well , that makes sense to me , counselor .
no further questions .
just a few more for the defense .
thank you , alicia .
what ...
why was the amnio performed so late
in the pregnancy , doctor ?
why ?
uh , i @-@ i didn &apos;t perform it .
i know .
dr. tuft did .
but do you know why the amnio was performed
so late in the second trimester ?
well , this was the second amnio .
the first was performed in april .
and did you find that
tara had spotting after the first amnio ?
yes .
and could this have come
from a poorly performed amnio ?
okay , let &apos;s hold up here . i &apos;m not sure why
the plaintiff isn &apos;t objecting ,
but what is the relevance ?
pure curiosity , your honor .
well , let &apos;s satisfy our curiosity
on our own time , shall we ?
i sustain the objection that never came .
so , you want to sue the hospital .
i don &apos;t want to ; i will sue the hospital .
their amnio caused these birth defects .
and you want the child born ?
no . your client wants the child born .
yes , but it means more to a suit if the child is born ?
$ 8 million more .
it &apos;s pain and suffering .
$ 2 million if tara aborts , $ 10 million if she doesn &apos;t .
does tara know that ?
what , that we &apos;re suing ?
no . she &apos;s doing it because she believes it .
i &apos;m pro @-@ choice .
it gives you the most options .
abortion is a sin .
you &apos;re a republican ; you have to say that .
no , i &apos;m not a republican .
i just look at photos of fetuses and think ,
how can we flush them down the drain ?
no one &apos;s flushing anything down the drain .
i met this rockette back the &apos; 50s .
looked just like cyd charisse .
oh , god , cyd charisse !
those legs ! oh !
if men could get pregnant ,
abortion would be a sacrament .
it &apos;s legal .
what else do you want ?
we were messing around ,
you know , backstage , the green room .
she came to me three months later , pregnant .
are you kidding me ? !
took her to canada .
this is what i don &apos;t get about abortion .
where do you think the personality went .
if it had been aborted ...
hold on . hold on !
quiet down .
we &apos;re here to negotiate diane &apos;s exit package .
and i have some research .
this is what we offered jonas stern
when he exited in 2009 .
are you friggin &apos; kidding me ?
we were in better financial straits back then .
we should offer her half of this
and she &apos;d still be lucky .
i don &apos;t disagree .
jonas stern was a founding partner ...
so is diane .
so was diane . she &apos;s leaving .
there &apos;s no difference between jonas &apos;s impact on the firm and diane &apos;s .
that may have been true back then , but the firm has changed .
what has diane done but move us toward bankruptcy ?
david , she &apos;s going to be a supreme court justice .
i agree with alicia .
here &apos;s the other problem-- diane has good clients .
we anger her with a lowball offer ,
we lose them .
how will we lose them ?
she suggests they go somewhere else .
let &apos;s be practical .
we offer a fair amount ; we keep her clients with us .
tara &apos;s fetus won &apos;t be viable until the third trimester .
and that &apos;s in 48 hours ?
yes , that &apos;s why the decision to terminate
has to be made quickly .
now , tara &apos;s ob @-@ gyn has suggested that the fetus is viable now .
yes , i heard that . she &apos;s wrong .
viability is based on survivability outside tara &apos;s womb .
and that &apos;s why the supreme court
in roe v. wade established the beginning of the third trimester
as an inviolable line ?
yes , exactly .
thank you , doctor .
nothing further .
dr. tuft , isn &apos;t survivability based on current technology ?
of course .
and given the current improvements in postnatal technology ,
can &apos;t the fetus survive outside tara &apos;s womb earlier ?
not in my opinion , no . this is a very special case .
doctor , don &apos;t you have a reason for wanting the fetus aborted ?
excuse me , objection , your honor .
who &apos;s questioning the witness ?
if the fetus is aborted , then the malpractice lawsuit
against you will be reduced .
objection , your honor !
the defense is turning this into an argument about malpractice .
no , no , no , you don &apos;t have ...
we all know you &apos;re excited to be in big boy court .
if you have a problem with me ...
you might want to check the laws on slander , sir .
i &apos;m not slandering the witness ,
i &apos;m asking him a ...
you &apos;re saying ...
the question before me is whether this contract is moot .
due to fetal viability ,
there &apos;s no way not to be in breach .
given the conflicting testimony of the doctors ,
i have no way to split this ...
uh , dilemma .
so i fall back on the supreme court &apos;s decision .
damn it .
with respect to the contract in question ,
the fetus is ruled nonviable
and will remain so for 40 more hours .
your honor ?
given that , we move that these proceedings continue apace .
uh , your honor , we don &apos;t have our next witness until friday .
mrs. florrick .
have your witnesses available this afternoon .
or we will proceed without them .
no .
what does that mean ?
it means i don &apos;t accept your exit package .
we can shove you out , you know .
yes , i do know that .
and my clients , too .
what is that-- a threat ?
it is a fact . don &apos;t act innocent .
you already have some of the associates calling my clients ,
trying to split them off .
you &apos;re paranoid , diane .
these are similar to the terms offered to jonas stern .
and i am not jonas stern .
what do you want , diane ?
i want what i &apos;m worth .
you want me to not bad talk you to my clients ,
rethink your offer .
now get out of my office .
this isn &apos;t your office .
it is .
until you have the security guards escort me out .
alicia ?
do you have a minute ?
i ... sure .
i can &apos;t decide this by myself .
but i can sway most of the partners .
and i think you &apos;ll enjoy a honeymoon period as the governor &apos;s wife .
oh ... okay . i &apos;m not ...
i want you to consider replacing diane as managing partner .
tara asked a lot of questions about the contract .
we listened , made changes at her request .
we wanted her to feel part of the process .
and who represented ms. bach ?
alicia florrick .
i see .
and did mrs. florrick ever raise any concerns
that the surrogacy contract was coercive in any way ?
your honor , respondent would stipulate
that the contract as a whole is not coercive .
this is about a single provision .
yes .
now that mrs. florrick has given herself cover
against a malpractice suit ,
may i continue ?
the provision regarding your right to terminate the pregnancy ,
that wasn &apos;t part of the standard agency contract .
was it ?
no .
my husband and i insisted on it .
why ?
because our first child , caleb , had a heart defect .
he lived six months .
five operations .
and in the end , we just ...
we couldn &apos;t bring another child into the world to suffer .
and is that why you want to terminate this pregnancy ?
yes .
i wish i were the one that were pregnant .
but i &apos;m not .
but it &apos;s our child .
our choice .
no one should be allowed to take that from us .
what i want is a proposed budget before the state assembly ...
so , barry rovinski &apos;s company owns the building
that alicia &apos;s new firm just leased space in ?
yes , an obvious conflict of interest .
i assure you neither peter nor alicia knew that
when he appointed barry to the water board .
yes , but the terms of the lease might be
considered preferential .
25 a square foot in an area where 40 &apos;s the market rate ?
what would you have peter do ?
the lease has already been executed .
i think he should reconsider barry &apos;s candidacy .
he &apos;ll look into it .
i was promised unfettered access .
all due respect , you are not the governor @-@ elect .
yes , thank you for your respect .
and this is unfettered access to the governor &apos;s chief of staff .
we should be on the same side , eli .
we are on the same side .
you can &apos;t keep disagreeing with me
and pretend it &apos;s an agreement .
i agree .
okay .
ethical issues are never obvious and they never go away .
that &apos;s why i raise them .
because i like peter and want to see him succeed .
you mean , mr. florrick ?
of course .
mrs. isenstadt ,
you believe you and your husband have absolute autonomy
over the fate of this ... fetus , right ?
yes , i do .
why is that ?
because it &apos;s ours .
and what about your body ?
do you think you should have control over that ?
over my body ?
yes , i do .
so ,
you &apos;re pro @-@ choice ?
yes , but this is different .
how ? how is it different ?
you want this contract imposed
even though tara doesn &apos;t want an abortion .
it &apos;s different because tara is not the mother .
i &apos;m the mother .
but it &apos;s her body .
objection , argumentative .
it &apos;s okay , i ...
i want to answer .
yes , it &apos;s her body ,
but she has agreed to subject her body
to my needs as a mother .
the mother-- that &apos;s what this contract was .
this is about my choice , not hers .
so you would drag tara to a clinic
and have this fetus forcibly removed ?
withdrawn .
no more questions .
i &apos;ll have a ruling on the contract &apos;s enforceability
within the hour .
yeah .
uh , cary , i have to be in court in ten minutes .
what do you need ?
are taking the managing partnership ?
where &apos;d you hear that ?
is it true ?
will offered it to me .
but it &apos;s not a sure thing .
and i don &apos;t know even if i would take it .
but you &apos;re considering it ?
don &apos;t you think that would &apos;ve been
a good thing to tell us ?
it just happened .
alicia .
staying is a mistake .
you &apos;ll always be under will .
you finally have a chance to get out from under him , take it .
managing partnership is not under him .
it is .
why do you think he &apos;s offering it to you ?
he wants someone he can influence .
someone that he knows .
okay , thanks , cary .
alicia , this is your chance .
take it .
after much consideration--
actually , 30 minutes of consideration--
i have concluded that control of one &apos;s body is an absolute .
this principle is enshrined
in our constitution and jurisprudence .
parties may not contract around it .
a provision empowering the isenstadts
to compel an abortion is an affront to public policy .
the application for specific performance is denied .
your honor , my client moves for a declaratory judgment
that the contract has been breached .
excuse me , your honor .
by denying petitioners &apos; motion
for specific performance ...
the court has ruled only
that the provision related to abortion is unenforceable .
plaintiffs allege a number of other contractual breaches .
what a load of bunk .
they &apos;re trying to extort this lovely young mother @-@ to @-@ be
into an abortion .
gentlemen !
no !
mr. schmidt , what breaches are you referring to ?
the defendant failed to live up to various ...
performance sections of the contract .
oh , come on . your honor , if mr. schmidt &apos;s clients
wish to bring a separate suit ...
no , no . no need . in the interest of judicial economy ,
i will hear the motion for declaratory judgment .
they lost , right ? what are they doing now ?
scorching the earth and poisoning the wells .
hi , i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m cam .
is grace here ?
she ...
uh , i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re ... ?
cam .
you must be mrs. florrick .
uh , i @-@ i told grace i might swing by after dinner .
i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m running a little late .
she &apos;s out .
um , but maybe you &apos;d like to come in and have a beer .
yeah , that &apos;d be great .
thanks .
are you insane ?
my daughter is 16 years old .
you do not come knocking at her door again .
do you understand , cam ?
now is the time to say &quot; yes . &quot;
yes .
good !
express elevator is right behind you .
turn around .
why does david lee not trust you ?
he thinks i &apos;m doing what you &apos;re doing .
what am i doing ?
leaving with cary and the other fourth years .
oh . well ...
all right , i need help .
i think this doctor on the surrogacy case
has a drinking problem , but i need someone
at the sa &apos;s office to confirm rumors of a dui .
do you have suggestions ?
yes .
can you tell me them ?
no .
why not ?
robyn , you &apos;re leaving .
yeah . well , so is alicia , but you help her .
what ?
so is alicia , but you helped her on the death penalty case .
alicia &apos;s leaving ?
yeah , i thought you knew .
what ...
she didn &apos;t say anything .
yeah . it &apos;s supposed to be a secret .
check with the clinic &apos;s medical rep .
they usually know all the doctor &apos;s problems .
thank you .
so , eli tells me
you have a @-@ a concern over my choice for the water board .
i do . the problem is , sir , one of appearances .
appearances . uh @-@ huh .
so who would you choose ?
the current water board head .
grabowski ? he &apos;s an idiot .
well , i can &apos;t speak to that , sir .
continuity , of course , is to be valued .
and there would be no hint of a conflict of interest .
yes . so what you &apos;re saying
is that you would hire someone second @-@ rate
because they &apos;re more ethical ?
no , i &apos;m just saying
that a conflict of interest is a matter of law ,
and second @-@ rate is a matter of opinion .
who do you like better , hemingway or dan brown ?
i &apos;m not a good judge of literature , sir .
uh , who &apos;s dan brown ?
da vinci code .
oh , okay .
well , i haven &apos;t read it ; i @-@ i &apos;ve seen it .
and i really like tom hanks .
who doesn &apos;t ?
um , well , i don &apos;t think i can take your advice , marilyn .
and i really do appreciate it , but i just ...
can &apos;t choose dan brown over hemingway .
well , thank you for listening to me , sir .
sure .
and i &apos;ll make sure i take a look at da vinci code .
oh , don &apos;t do it on my account .
no .
i spent too many years in law school
with my eyes glued to lexisnexis .
i should ... uh , probably broaden my horizons .
yes , i read the contract .
could you please read the highlighted provision ?
&quot; during the course of the pregnancy ,
the surrogate agrees
not to engage in any sexual activity
that would constitute a risk to the fetus . &quot;
how many sexual partners have you had since your pregnancy ?
four , i guess .
but they always used a condom .
and did you and any of these upstanding gentlemen
ever engage in a threesome ?
objection , your honor . this is character assassination .
an orgy is a per se violation of her contractual commitment
not to engage in risky sexual behavior .
overruled . ms. bach , you may answer .
no , i never engaged in a threesome .
it was her idea .
the threesome was ?
yes . um , we were in this bar called chesterfield &apos;s ,
and she saw this guy with tattoos--
evan-- and tara said that we should bring him back to her place .
and did you ?
yes .
okay , that &apos;s a lie . you &apos;re a liar .
i haven &apos;t seen you in a year .
mrs. florrick ,
if your client can &apos;t restrain herself ...
i &apos;m sorry , your honor . it won &apos;t happen again .
and what happened after you brought evan back ?
well , we double ...
i mean , we had a threesome .
and did anyone use protection ?
uh , no . none of us .
it doesn &apos;t matter if he was lying .
the judge believed him .
so , what do we ...
what is going on ?
mr. florrick , it is so good to meet you .
i &apos;m david lee , one of your earlier fans .
alicia and i work together .
oh , hello , mr. lee . how are you ?
good , good .
you have quite a wife here .
what &apos;s up , peter ?
nothing . i , uh ... i had a break .
i thought i &apos;d come say hello .
it was supposed to be a surprise .
a little difficult with the security detail .
it &apos;s still a surprise to us .
um , okay , excuse me .
um , i booked a suite in wailea .
they have a package for renewing your vows .
um , peter , i thought you said ...
i mean , i thought we had to wait until after the inauguration .
i thought we did , too , but it will be
just as difficult after the inauguration ,
so i think we should do it now .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
i love you .
i love you , too . i ...
i &apos;m sorry to bother you , mr. florrick .
alicia , the judge wants us back in .
your honor , 30 minutes ago ,
ms. bach approached my client and offered
to abort the fetus for $ 100,000 .
judge , that is a preposterous lie .
it constitutes blackmail , your honor .
wait a minute .
you &apos;ve ruled that my client has the right
to decide whether to have an abortion .
there &apos;s nothing illegal about monetizing that right .
so you &apos;re saying that she made this offer ?
no , i &apos;m saying , if she did make this offer--
and i have no knowledge that she did--
she was merely using money as a carrot ,
just as the isenstadts used it as a stick .
judge , if tying the destruction of a fetus
to the payment of money isn &apos;t blackmail , nothing is .
okay . i &apos;ll hear from ms. bach
on this question first thing tomorrow .
judge , even if she were to make the offer ,
it was nothing more than a permissible settlement negotiation
in a civil case .
or a crime .
if i find your client &apos;s committed one ,
i &apos;ll refer her to the state &apos;s attorney .
mom , did you tell cam to leave me alone ?
good morning , grace .
did you tell cam to get lost ?
you mean the man with the motorcycle helmet ,
the man who came to my door , who wanted to come in
and have a beer and wait for you ?
mom , he &apos;s my pastor .
he &apos;s the head of campus faith .
he was supposed to pick up some reading plans .
okay ... grace , he didn &apos;t look like a ...
i don &apos;t know what he looked like ,
but just because they &apos;re pastors doesn &apos;t mean anything .
mom , what &apos;s going on ?
i saw the web site-- the ten hottest daughters .
zach showed you .
no , i forced him to show me .
mom , that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
i &apos;m not after all of that .
i know , honey , but boys are .
so ?
so ...
you &apos;re dressing differently .
you &apos;re taking dresses from my closet .
you said i could .
i know , but , grace , i &apos;m your mom , and this ...
mom ... i want to be pretty .
just let me be pretty .
oh , honey , you are pretty .
no , you have to say that .
i want other people to think that i &apos;m pretty .
did you tell my clients that you &apos;d only have an abortion
if they paid you $ 100,000 ?
no , i did not .
if the court would please instruct the witness she &apos;s under oath .
objection , your honor .
the witness has been sworn and is fully aware of that .
you are under oath , ma &apos;am .
i might have said that $ 100,000 ...
i was looking into the possibility that dr. tuft has a dui .
really ?
yeah .
he doesn &apos;t , but i was checking with his medical reps
and i did find out something else .
so , what do you have ?
as dr. tuft &apos;s notes show ,
he cultured the embryo 48 hours prior to implantation .
meaning there &apos;s been a miscalculation of fetal age .
let me see that .
we &apos;re in the third trimester , mr. schmidt ,
meaning the fetus is viable .
which means you won &apos;t be able to pressure
our client to terminate .
you &apos;re selfish , tara .
it &apos;d be one thing if you said i &apos;m adopting him ,
but you &apos;re walking away .
remember what you said , kathy , after the first sonogram ?
&quot; do everything you can to protect my baby &quot;
this isn &apos;t protecting .
it &apos;s owning .
i &apos;m keeping him alive .
that &apos;s the only way i know how to protect him .
feel him kicking , kathy .
just feel him .
no .
it &apos;s the final offer , diane .
no , it &apos;s the final offer when i accept it .
no .
howard , david , could you please give us a moment ?
we got a problem ?
no , just something between diane and myself .
alicia , you stay .
i &apos;m going to want you to run a change in the contract .
what do you want ?
more than this .
no , this isn &apos;t about money .
this is about us .
so , what do you want from me ?
i put my life into this place .
my whole life .
and it &apos;s appreciated .
no , it &apos;s not--
not with ghouls like that shoving me out the door .
well , i can &apos;t negotiate appreciation .
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s why you &apos;d better do it with money .
and how much appreciation are you looking for , your honor ?
i must have really hurt you ...
to make you want to hurt me like this .
that was the deal from the beginning , diane , remember ?
we work together until it &apos;s not fun or profitable anymore .
well , here we are .
are you having fun ?
bump the package up by 20 % and i &apos;ll leave .
i can &apos;t do that .
then find another way .
i &apos;ll be at home .
she &apos;ll come around .
she knows she can &apos;t be sworn in with a partnership dispute
hanging over her head .
we need to leave this week .
you &apos;re sure ?
yes .
