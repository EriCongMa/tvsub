wow , sheldon , i cannot believe you made up your own game .
oh , &quot; research lab &quot; is more than a game .
it &apos;s like the slogan says : &quot; the physics is theoretical ,
but the fun is real . &quot;
we must not be playing it right .
all right , five .
one , two , three , four , five .
oh , wow , look at that .
my department of defense research grant is renewed .
oh ! great roll !
now you can demolish your soviet @-@ style cyclotron
and build the large hadron collider .
yay .
you &apos;re a natural at this , penny .
and as the first beta testers , you two &apos;ll have quite the edge
when we play with wolowitz and koothrappali on sunday .
oh , gee , sheldon ,
i don &apos;t think we can play on sunday .
why not ?
because of the reasons that penny will now tell you . penny ?
actually , i have to pick up my friend justin from the airport .
there you go-- she has to pick up her friend justin at the airport .
and i can &apos;t play &apos; cause i &apos;m going with her-- right ?
um , yeah , if you want .
i mean , there may not be room .
he &apos;s got a lot of stuff--like guitars and amplifiers ...
wait .
what are you talking about ?
my friend justin .
pay attention , leonard .
that &apos;s why she can &apos;t play on sunday .
who is this justin ?
your turn , leonard .
i told you about him .
no , you didn &apos;t .
roll the dice , leonard .
yeah-- my friend from omaha ; plays the guitar .
anyway , he &apos;s coming to l.a. looking for some session work ,
so i told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks .
come on , leonard--if you roll a six ,
penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown .
see what i mean when i say the fun is real ?
hang on .
some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch ?
he &apos;s not &quot; some guy . &quot;
he &apos;s my friend .
so by &quot; friend , &quot; do you mean &quot; friend friend , &quot;
&quot; gay friend , &quot; or &quot; ex @-@ boyfriend
&quot; who you &apos;re now platonic with
but still might have a thing for you friend &quot; ?
well , he &apos;s definitely not gay .
oh , ho @-@ ho , a definitely not gay musician
sleeping on my girlfriend &apos;s couch .
yippee .
okay , we went out a little bit , a long time ago .
but we were never like &quot; going out . &quot;
okay , not to be pedantic , but last i checked
&quot; went out &quot; was in fact the past tense of &quot; going out &quot; --
which i think we all know is a popular euphemism
for &quot; saw each other naked . &quot;
i &apos;ll just roll for you .
do you have a problem with justin staying with me ?
what was your first clue ?
uh @-@ oh ! industrial accident .
you know what ? don &apos;t talk to me like i &apos;m an idiot .
i &apos;m not talking to you like you &apos;re an idiot !
i &apos;m saying the whole idea is idiotic !
&quot; you accidentally stare at a helium @-@ argon laser .
lose one turn and a retina . &quot;
how is that not talking to me like i &apos;m an idiot ?
it &apos;s my friend , it &apos;s my couch ,
and it &apos;s my freakin &apos; life !
it &apos;s also your roll .
you know what ? it is your life .
if you want to have some stupid guitarist
stay on your couch , then fine !
why don &apos;t you just rent
some bunk beds and invite the black eyed peas ? !
hey , if i want to invite the entire lineup of lollapalooza
to sleep in my apartment , i will , and it &apos;s none of your business !
are you listening to yourself ?
do you know how childish you sound right now ?
oh , now i &apos;m a child ? well , at least i &apos;m not an idiot anymore !
the two aren &apos;t mutually exclusive !
oh , you are such a--
what the hell is he doing ? !
he &apos;s drowning us out . he doesn &apos;t like fighting .
sheldon , just stop ! look , the fight is over !
oh , and fyi ,
you never even heard of the black eyed peas until you met me !
i heard of &apos; em !
didn &apos;t know they were a band .
sheldon , she &apos;s gone . you can turn off the blender .
has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end ?
no , we just had a little spat .
look on the bright side . as a result of penny &apos;s forfeit
you have become the world &apos;s first winner of &quot; research lab . &quot;
would you like a commemorative snow cone ?
i don &apos;t get how she can just announce
that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch .
hey , i thought of a game we can play in the car .
i don &apos;t want to play a game , sheldon .
it &apos;s called &quot; scientists . &quot;
now , i will name three scientists ,
then you will put them in order
of the size of their contribution to their respective fields .
to make this game even more compelling ,
you must consider only the contribution
of the man to the field ,
not the validity of the field itself .
for example : abu musa jabir ibn hayyan
made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy
than halbert vanderplatt made to neurobiology .
okay , ready to have some fun ?
an old boyfriend who &apos;s definitely not gay .
that &apos;s what a guy likes to hear-- &quot; definitely . &quot;
all right , i &apos;ll start with an easy one :
um , isaac newton , madame curie and niels bohr .
and then i say one little thing and i end up being the bad guy !
hint : madame curie had her husband to help her .
what am i supposed to say ?
&quot; sure , penny , i &apos;m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment . &quot;
&quot; well , leonard , it doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re cool or not
&quot; because i &apos;m penny and i &apos;m pretty
and i can do whatever the hell i want ! &quot;
&quot; oh , i get it !
&quot; you think you &apos;re doing me a favor just by
being in a relationship with me ! &quot;
&quot; no , no , leonard ! i &apos;doing you a favor
just by being in the same room as you ! &quot;
leonard ! stop the car !
what ?
i can &apos;t listen to the two of you fight anymore .
come on , come on , we &apos;re late .
calm down . we &apos;ll make the movie .
i believe my alarm is appropriate , given the situation .
the movie starts in 17 minutes ,
which means we &apos;ll need to make all the lights
on colorado boulevard , plus skip the concession stand ,
and preshow urination .
oh , dude , i wish you had said something
before i pounded that last red bull .
go , go , power rangers , go !
we &apos;re , uh , going to the movies .
no , we &apos;re not .
we &apos;re standing in the hallway ,
suffering through an awkward encounter .
hang on .
they &apos;re showing a new digital print of time bandits .
you wouldn &apos;t want to come , would you ?
not really , no .
all right , invitation pointlessly offered ,
invitation declined as expected ,
everyone &apos;s civil , nobody &apos;s fighting .
have a nice evening .
just give us a minute .
oh , take all the time you need .
so , are we going to talk about last night ?
are you ready to apologize ?
no .
wrong answer . but thank you for playing .
oh , come on .
this is stupid .
oh , there it is again !
you think i &apos;m stupid !
no , there &apos;s a difference
between being stupid and acting stupid .
oh , yeah ? well , there &apos;s a difference
between being a jerk and being an ass !
no , there isn &apos;t !
they &apos;re synonyms !
well , that was rather unpleasant .
yeah , i don &apos;t think i need my preshow urination anymore .
leonard , when that woman moved in three years ago ,
i told you not to talk to her , and now look ,
we &apos;re going to be late for the movies .
hey ! look ! amazing spider @-@ man 183 .
got it .
remember this one ?
spider @-@ man loses a big fight
and then his girl friend breaks up with him .
want me to get it for you ?
it &apos;ll help take your mind off things .
hey , guys . what &apos;s going on ?
oh , we need to kill a couple hours
till the next showing of time bandits .
oh , well , no problem .
i was thinking of closing early and going home ,
but let &apos;s face it ,
that &apos;s just a slightly smaller lonely room
filled with comic book
thanks , stuart .
let me ask you something .
do you think it &apos;s okay for penny
to have an ex @-@ boyfrid sleep on her couch ?
no , i mean , she &apos;s obviousl way out of line .
thank you !
but if she dumps you ,
she &apos;ll have a new boyfrien by tomorrow morning
and you &apos;ll have a new girl friend
when you figure out how to build one .
so the only question is : how long until you fold ?
i am not going to fold .
well , excuse me , i don &apos;t think
penny &apos;s out of line at all .
you don &apos;t own her .
it &apos;s like my girl beyonce says :
&quot; if you like it , you should put a ring on it . &quot;
come on .
at the very least ,
when she found out leonard was upset about it ,
she should &apos;ve backed off .
you mean like when a guy &apos;s upset
because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him
and then doesn &apos;t show up
because he &apos;s doing a juice fast with his mother ?
i didn &apos;t know you were upset about that .
really ! did you miss all the subtitle indicators ,
like me saying , &quot; howard , i am upset . &quot;
okay , sorry .
maybe it means something different in this country .
back in india , it means you &apos;re upset with a guy named howard !
i said i &apos;m sorry .
sorry doesn &apos;t make up for the fact
that i had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy .
do you know what vegan chicken and rice is ?
rice !
yeah , well , you think i was having fun ,
sitting around all night listening to my mother say ,
&quot; have you ever peed so much in your life ? &quot;
oh , my god , you are such a mama &apos;s boy .
hey , don &apos;t bring my mother into this !
you brought your mother into this !
stop it , both of you .
all this fighting , i might as well
be back with my parents ! &quot; damn it , george ,
&quot; i told you if you didn &apos;t quit drinkin &apos; i &apos;d leave you ! &quot;
&quot; well , i guess that makes you a liar .
&quot; &apos; cause i &apos;m drunk as hell and you &apos;re still here ! &quot;
&quot; stop yelling ! &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re making sheldon cry ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s making sheldon cry !
that i let you name him sheldon &quot;
boy , what got him so upset ?
oh , sure , you can tell when sheldon &apos;s upset .
oh , thank you very much .
come back soon .
with the other half of my tip .
hey , sheldon . what are you doing here ?
this is a restaurant . it &apos;s lunchtime .
i would think , as a waitress , you &apos;d be familiar withhe paradigm .
is leonard coming ?
no , i believe leonard is waiting
for yo to come crawling back to him and apologize .
well , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i assumed that would be your attitude .
hence , my true purpose coming here .
which is ?
i want you to crawl back to him and apologize .
i &apos;m busy .
excuse me , miss .
i &apos;like to order lunch .
fine . what do you want ?
i have a few questions .
first , i notice that you offer soup and a half @-@ sandwich ?
yes .
where exactly does the half @-@ sandwich come from ?
are you giving me half of someone else &apos;s sandwich ,
or do i have to wait
for someone else in the restaurant
to order the other half ?
no , no , sheldon , they just make a half @-@ sandwich .
you can &apos;t make a half @-@ sandwich .
if it &apos;s t half of a whole sandwich ,
it &apos;s just a small sandwich .
okay , fine , it &apos;s soup and a small sandwich .
that what you want ?
of course not . i &apos;ll have my usual .
great .
aren &apos;t you going to ask me if i want a beverage ?
don &apos;t you usually get lemonade ?
yes .
do you want lemonade ?
yes .
anything else ?
yes-- i want you to apologize to leonard .
i am not going to apologize .
i &apos;ve done nothing wrong .
he is completely overreacting .
irrelevant .
the disruption in your relaonship
is making my life intolerable .
well , i &apos;m sorry , sheldon , but this really isn &apos;t about you .
i don &apos;t follow .
ah , yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
look , sheldon , i have to go .
all right , let &apos;s assume , ad argumentum ,
that in this case , leonard is wrong .
leonard is wrong .
considering the number of transgressions
you &apos;ve committed that he &apos;s overlooked ,
don &apos;t you think that , just this once ,
you could return the favor ?
i &apos;m coming .
good @-@ bye , sheldon .
what do you mean , transgressions i &apos;ve committed ?
were you under the impression
that leonard has no complaints about you ?
like what ? ! yeah , yeah , i see you .
you &apos;re making a little check sign in the air .
i got it . just hold you horses .
what does leonard complain about ?
your driving .
the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed
that stare at him during your amorous activities .
your constant tardiness , your singing .
my singing ?
that &apos;s actually from my list .
but leonard would be a fool if he didn &apos;t agree with it .
okay , if leonard has so many problems with me ,
why hasn &apos;t he just said so ?
because , according to him
you &apos;re oversensitive and have a temper .
oh , really ?
well , then , do me a favor
and tell leonard that he can drop dead !
and she wonders why she &apos;s constantly undertipped .
oh , good , you &apos;re home .
i need you to do ma favor .
sure .
go apologize to penny .
what ? !
right now would be good .
leonard !
although , a few minutes ago would have been better .
i hear you don &apos;t like my stuffed animals ,
my driving or my punctuality .
what ? who would tell you something like that ?
why would you tell her something like that ?
it doesn &apos;t matter why he told me .
it &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ?
okay , yeah , it &apos;s true ,
but i can live with that stuff .
what i can &apos;t live with is you casually informing me
that some guy &apos;s going to be staying your apartment
wiout even asking me first !
that isn &apos;t your problem !
your problem is you don &apos;t trust me !
oh , come on .
sheldon , have you ever once heard me say
that i don &apos;t trust penny ?
sheldon ? where did he go ?
oh , your yelling
must have freaked him out again .
where are you going ? !
you just walk away
in the middle of aargument ? !
no .
i &apos;m going to go find your damn roommate
before he hurts himself
trying to cross the street something !
why didn &apos;t you say so ?
oh , now i need your permission for that , too ? !
well , i can &apos;t read your mind , penny !
really ? why not ?
you &apos;re so smart , and i &apos;m so dumb !
raj ?
stop knocking ! it &apos;s open !
please tell my parents that our dark matter research
is at a critical juncture , and i can &apos;t come home
for my cousin sanjay &apos;s wedding .
sheldon
ask our son what we &apos;re supposed to say to mr. and mrs. cheldry
whose daughter , lakshmi is flying in from london ,
for the sole purpose of meeting him .
i didn &apos;t ask you to set me up with lakshmi .
you should be thanking us !
yes.lakshmi just got her stomach stapled .
you have an opportunity to get in good with her
before she loses weight , and her self @-@ esteem goes up .
i don &apos;t care !
and why don &apos;t you think i can find a woman for myself ?
because you &apos;re 27
and the closest thing we have to a daughter @-@ in @-@ law
is that jewish boy howard .
oh .. that is completely below the belt .
sheldon , tell my parents that howard and i are just friends .
sheldon ?
howard and i are just friends !
fine . i &apos;ll come home for sanjay &apos;s wedding .
sheldon ? !
what are you doing ?
he &apos;s not a lost dog .
hey , why don &apos;t you just let me find him
while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake ?
the brake might be imaginary ,
but that stop sign you just ran wasn &apos;t .
what stop sign ?
eyes on the road . eyes on the road !
howard , answer the door ! i &apos;m busy !
i &apos;m busy , too ! you answer it .
i can &apos;t ! i &apos;m on the toilet !
for god &apos;s sake , i don &apos;t need to hear that !
can &apos;t you just say , &quot; i &apos;m busy &quot; ?
i said i &apos;m busy , but that was &apos;t good enough for you !
you know what ? i hope it &apos;s one of those home invasion deals ,
and they shoot me in the head !
well , if it &apos;s a home invader ,
don &apos;t tell them i &apos;m on the toilet !
there &apos;s no one there .
you &apos;re hearing things , you crazy old lady !
hey , stuart , have you seen sheldon ?
yeah , he &apos;s , uh , over in the graphic novel section .
built himself a little nest .
thank you .
uh , penny ?
yeah ?
is everything okay ?
what do you mean ?
sheldon told me you and leonard were having a fight ?
oh , yeah , kind of .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s no big thing .
oh , good , good .
i love you .
i &apos;m not leaving until you talk to me .
all right , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s a little hard to explain . he does this thing
where he pretends he &apos;s in an alternate dimension
that occupies the same physical space we &apos;re in ,
but he can &apos;t perceive us .
don &apos;t flatter yourself . i &apos;m just ignoring you .
come on , sheldon , let &apos;s go home .
look , we &apos;re done fighting .
i &apos;ve heard that before .
but then , the next thing you know ,
i &apos;m hiding in my bedroom , blaring a richard feynman lecture
while my mom is shouting that jesus would forgive her
if she put ground glass in my dad &apos;s meatloaf .
and my dad &apos;s on the roof skeet @-@ shooting
her franklin mint collectible plates .
there &apos;s going to no more shouting
and no skeet @-@ shooting .
really ?
where &apos;s your friend justin going to sleep ?
yeah ... where &apos;s he gonna sleep ?
oh , my god , would you let this go ? !
i &apos;d let it go .
why should i let it go ?
why don &apos;t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep ? !
oh , for god &apos;s sakes .
so , you have childhood issues .
we all have childhood issues .
at some point , you just need to grow up and get past them .
fire ! fire !
leonard , will you just let me handle this , please ?
again ! fire ! fire !
let ... just ... look ...
sheldon , please , try and understand .
look , leonard and i are in a relationship ,
and occasionally , we &apos;re going to fight .
but no matter what happens between us ,
we will always love you .
right , leonard ?
always is a long time .
sure . always .
you know , how about we buy you this robot ,
and then we all go home ?
i want that one .
okay , you can have that one .
oh , come on , he &apos;s just going to play with it twice ,
and then it &apos;ll end up in his closet with all the other junk .
buy him the robot , leonard .
can i get this comic book , too ?
yes , you can .
meet me again .
so what did justin say when you told him
he couldn &apos;t sleep on your couch ?
he &apos;a musician .
he &apos;s sleep in his own vomit , if he has to .
i should have asked for much more
