i guess you &apos;re putting in a lot of hours with will .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t have a plan . let &apos;s just drop this , okay ?
he told me to drop it .
anything said in voicemail doesn &apos;t count .
tonight i would like to announce
a new candidate for state &apos;s attorney .
wendy scott @-@ carr .
thank you so much .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to take up a lot of your time . i just , um ...
i could say that i was running because of some grand ideals ,
but , um , it &apos;s really ...
it &apos;s about a fountain .
i have two daughters ,
and there was this fountain near the courthouse that i used to love ,
so i took them to see it ,
and , uh , it wasn &apos;t running .
who &apos;s wendy scott @-@ carr ?
so , i went to maintenance ...
no , i know that . what else ?
... but they said that the contractor
had an exclusive deal with an alderman ,
and he told me that there were no more funds available ...
we need to check on our endorsements .
... the money had disappeared ...
who is she ?
civil action bureau , low level .
oh . her grandad was at selma .
how do you cut through the layers of corruption ?
how do we get the fountain working again ?
thank you .
the tribune &apos;s over there .
come on , let &apos;s do a drop @-@ by quote .
and now , as dinner is served , steppenwolf theatre will entertain us
with scenes from their hit play , the cow with no country .
three @-@ pointer .
who , derrick rose ?
bulls up by eight .
moo @-@ cow , come back !
you &apos;re the best moo @-@ cow in the whole world , and i love you .
you &apos;re not just a cow .
you &apos;re my best friend , moo @-@ cow .
good stuff .
so how do you know will ?
my sister . she used to date him .
really ?
okay .
he broke her heart . it was devastating .
we don &apos;t really need to go there .
now we have to go there .
she took 20 aspirin .
we had to get her stomach pumped .
she &apos;s making this up .
will came home from college and told her it was over .
he &apos;d fallen in love with somebody else .
so you &apos;re here for revenge ?
yup .
my sister &apos;s avenging angel .
going to date him and break his heart .
i &apos;ll toy with him first .
make him think his jokes are funny .
my jokes aren &apos;t funny ?
please don &apos;t take moo @-@ cow to the front lines . please !
i &apos;ll find you , moo . i &apos;ll end this , and i &apos;ll find you .
sorry to interrupt .
what is it ?
there &apos;s someone at the office who needs to speak to you .
your phone was off .
who , a client ?
no .
uh , she says she was just sexually assaulted .
did she go to the police ?
yes .
they refused to prosecute .
did she have a rape kit administered ?
no . it &apos;s not ...
it &apos;s inappropriate contact .
okay , so ...
take her name and number , and i &apos;ll phone her tomorrow .
actually , i really think you want to come talk to her now .
why ?
because of the person she said did it .
and you believe her ?
enough .
his leg is broken . we &apos;ll have to put him out of his misery .
um , excuse me . i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m gonna run across the street for a minute .
is everything all right ?
oh , yes . can you just let peter know i &apos;ll be right back ?
i &apos;ve been wandering for weeks .
my ears . i can &apos;t hear .
where are you , moo @-@ cow ?
are you there ?
are you there ? !
hello . miss white , is it ?
yes . hi .
wow , it is you , isn &apos;t it ?
they said that you worked here .
yes .
um , so i &apos;ve been filled in on your ... issue ,
and i just want to make sure ...
actually , could you tell me where this assault took place ?
in his hotel room .
oh . you were visiting him ?
yes .
uh , no .
the hotel sent me .
i &apos;m a lmt .
a ... ?
a licensed massage therapist .
uh , i was giving him a massage .
okay , i know that this sounds nuts .
um , i like him . i do .
i mean , what he does in africa on account of women .
and then he does ... this .
and you want to bring charges ? yeah .
i went to the police , and they , um ...
i guess i sounded nuts , so i came here ...
&apos;cause of you .
what hotel was this at ?
the foreland .
and you happen to remember what room number ?
906
though i think he had two rooms .
miss white , you do know that all we can do is bring suit .
we &apos;re lawyers . we &apos;re not the police .
but at least ... at least i don &apos;t feel crazy here .
when did this assault take place ?
i got to his room at 1 : 00 . the session is an hour .
i have the time on the bill , if that helps .
can i see it ?
yes , of course .
and what happened over here ?
um , he ... uh , he did that . here .
$ 650 ?
that &apos;s how much a massage costs ?
for a vip ? yes .
and is that a big tip ?
yeah . very big .
will you excuse me for a moment ?
he &apos;s not there .
there &apos;s a mr. harbour in room 906 .
okay . thanks .
i &apos;m kind of relieved . it was going to be a long night .
yeah . i can deal with her .
no , i got it .
okay , miss white , thank you so much for coming in , but , um ,
we don &apos;t handle ... cases like this .
i &apos;m sorry . what happened ?
no . nothing .
it &apos;s just , we have to be cautious about what kind of cases we take .
he got to you , didn &apos;t he ?
no , but thank you for coming in .
he &apos;s not under his own name at the hotel .
he &apos;s under an alias . like a movie star .
what name ?
mr. harbour .
joe kent ?
the nobel prize @-@ winning joe kent ?
yes . he &apos;s under an assumed name at the foreland .
i didn &apos;t even know he was in town .
he &apos;s speaking at now tomorrow .
and the state &apos;s attorney isn &apos;t prosecuting ?
that &apos;s what she says .
i &apos;m still trying to find out why .
i don &apos;t believe it .
he is being awarded the nobel peace prize for his work with women .
he &apos;s one of the most respected americans in the world .
so , what do we do ?
do you believe her ?
she seems ... calmer than i would expect ,
but this tip she got-- it &apos;s just ...
okay , why don &apos;t derrick and i go talk to her ?
just a few quick questions . we &apos;ll be right back .
no . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m fine .
lockhar &amp; gardner . yes .
i already said . 11 : 00 . bye .
do you have someplace to go ?
no , uh ... well , i mean , yes , but later .
someone at the police station phoned these creeps-- uh , carpton &amp; greene .
do you know them ?
the law firm . yes .
we take this and we &apos;re wrong--
we lose half our client list .
we take this and we &apos;re right-- then it &apos;s big .
financially big .
is she all right ?
yes . carpton &amp; greene phoned her .
they want her if we don &apos;t .
tread lightly , gentlemen .
she &apos;s meeting them at 11 : 00 .
11 : 00 tomorrow ?
no , tonight .
i &apos;ll get kalinda .
i &apos;ll get blake .
great . four hours to decide
if we sue the most beloved democrat in america .
to be honest , i don &apos;t think of myself as the african @-@ american candidate
or as the woman candidate .
the question is what the democratic committee will think of you .
well , my guess is , they &apos;ll think of me as the loose cannon .
i just stood up there and said they were part of the problem .
hello , eli .
mr. jordan .
wendy , this is mr. florrick &apos;s campaign manager .
yes , i know of mr. gold . we &apos;ve never met .
well , peter would love to say hello .
i &apos;d love that , too . after dessert ?
perfect .
and peter will see you for lunch tomorrow , mr. jordan .
oh , is that this week ?
yes , it &apos;s this week . uh , my office called to confirm .
i @-@ i &apos;ll give him a call .
we &apos;ve got endorsement issues .
vernon jordan might be in play .
this is the attorney @-@ client retainer agreement .
when you sign that , we &apos;re your lawyers ,
everything we say is privileged and cannot be used in court .
but up to that point-- up to the point you sign this form--
we can be subpoenaed , so ,
in order to protect you , we &apos;re not going to take any notes , okay ?
okay .
hey . where are you ?
i &apos;m there . you gonna tell me what the big secret is now ?
the masseuse-- the one we &apos;re thinking of representing--
she said she was assaulted by joe kent .
the joe kent ?
yes .
so we &apos;re trying to make a quick deal on this ,
but as you can imagine , it &apos;s sensitive .
yeah , accusing the nobel peace prize winner of sexual assault ,
i &apos;d say so .
we &apos;re questioning the masseuse now ,
but see what you can find out on kent , okay ?
room 906 .
you want anything ?
anything that &apos;ll expedite a settlement .
got it .
operator , can i have housekeeping ?
yeah , i &apos;m in room 906 . my trashcan is pretty full .
could you send someone up , please ?
what do you need ?
nothing now . kalinda &apos;s on it .
you sure ?
i &apos;m sure .
blake ?
yes , ma &apos;am ?
i need you to look into someone for me , if you &apos;re free .
i am free .
lara white .
what do you want to know ?
if she &apos;s lying ;
if she &apos;s trying to make a quick buck ;
if she &apos;s trying to embarrass mr. kent ;
any ties to the republican party .
okay .
it needs to happen fast . we have until 11 : 00 .
here &apos;s my cell .
phone me and only me , whatever you get .
if you &apos;re okay with that ?
i &apos;m okay with that .
and ... if you ever need anything like this in the future , ms. lockhart ,
don &apos;t hesitate to call .
he asked me to pay special attention to his adductor .
and that &apos;s ... ?
uh , the inside thigh . here .
and that is ... restricted ?
well , it usually means that a customer wants inappropriate contact .
sexual contact ?
yes .
and i was , like ... &quot; i don &apos;t do that ,
but i can massage the hamstring and the quadriceps &quot; &quot;
well , that made him pretty ... vexed .
so i was , like , &quot; i can send up somebody else . &quot;
and then what happened ?
well , then i went into the bathroom to wash my hands ,
and that &apos;s when i saw him behind me .
in the bathroom ?
yes .
and he was ...
you know , he had a robe , but his ...
his penis was exposed .
he was erect ?
yes .
and he was like , &quot; i paid for more . &quot;
and i went , &quot; no , sir , mr. kent .
you paid for exactly that amount &quot; &quot;
so , then he was like ,
&quot; could you help me with something in the bedroom &quot; &quot; his hamstring .
and why didn &apos;t you leave then ?
on account of , i only make money if the hotel wants me back ,
so i need to keep the vip customers happy .
from what you &apos;re saying , it doesn &apos;t seem
like there was any way to &quot; make mr. kent happy . &quot;
but my table was still in the bedroom , so i needed to get it .
so he took me in there ,
and he was struggling with this remote control .
um , he wanted to know how to work it .
i guess you could play video games ,
and he wanted to know how to play hedgehog .
and that &apos;s when he threw me on the bed .
he was on top of me .
he was grabbing me . he pinched my breasts ,
and he stuck his finger between my legs .
and you stopped him ?
no . after about a minute ,
the phone rang , and he was ...
i guess it was his wife , because he just jumped .
uh , so he grabbed this towel and he , you know ...
i &apos;m sorry .
did he do that on you or him ?
him .
uh , so anyway , i just grabbed my table , and i ran out of there .
miss white , don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but given that this happened five hours ago ,
you seem remarkably calm .
i &apos;m not sure how i &apos;m supposed to take that the right way .
take it as the first of a long line of hard questions .
would it make a difference if i was crying ?
you were sexually assaulted .
wouldn &apos;t that make sense ?
when i was kicked out of college ,
i cried for an hour , then i stopped . and i never cried again .
that &apos;s who i am .
but if it helps ,
i wish this had happened to somebody who cried a lot .
seriously ? hedgehog ?
the winner of the nobel peace prize wants to play hedgehog ?
it &apos;s a hotel room . he &apos;s away from home . it &apos;s an oasis from life .
this is a man who spent two years in butembo to see firsthand
how women were treated .
and he likes video games .
great men like video games .
you think she &apos;s lying ?
i think there is a wealth
of detail of her entering the room , and the massage itself .
but when she talks about the assault , it becomes variable .
the massage table is by the door , then it &apos;s in the bedroom .
she follows him into the bedroom .
it &apos;s about the hamstring .
no , it &apos;s about the remote .
i mean , if we take this case , she &apos;ll get better at it ,
because we &apos;ll make her better at it .
we &apos;ll point out her inconsistencies ,
so she &apos;ll make things more consistent .
but what we &apos;re hearing right now is the unvarnished story .
and i believe there was a massage .
but i don &apos;t believe there was an assault .
then why would she do it ? money ?
yes . and dirty tricks .
i think some people would like to see joe kent brought low .
come on , diane . do you know how hypocritical this is ?
last year , i @-@ i @-@ i didn &apos;t believe-- what &apos;s her name ,
the rape victim-- for the same reason .
she kept changing her story .
and you said , &quot; shock does that to a woman . &quot;
so which is it ?
that was kalinda . she found lipstick on a champagne glass .
you drank champagne ?
uh , when i was in the bedroom , he shoved it at me .
and i thought if i just pretended to drink ,
he would be fine and let me go .
was he holding you ?
no , but he was in the doorway .
you know , he was blocking it .
and you said your massage table was in the living room and the bedroom .
do you remember which it was , actually ?
uh , well , at that point , it was probably in the bedroom .
when i went to wash up , i took it with me .
so the bathroom was adjoining the bedroom ?
yes . why ?
well , when you were discussing it before ,
it sounded like it was adjoining the living room .
well , i th--
uh , yeah . there were two bathrooms .
it was a big suite .
and when i went to wash up the first time ...
before the massage ?
right .
i washed up in the living room bathroom ,
but then after the massage ,
i washed my hands in the bedroom bathroom .
why ?
why did i use the other bathroom ?
i don &apos;t know . i did .
good . good job .
she was checking joe kent &apos;s web site
on the exact same day she accuses him .
okay , see what you can get at the hotel .
i found the phone in your purse .
oh , good , i thought i lost it .
if you need it , i can , uh ...
i can run it over to you .
no , don &apos;t worry .
eli and i are , uh ... are working the room .
okay . well , good luck . bye .
can i have yours , too ?
sure .
good metabolism , huh ?
no .
ten @-@ mile run every morning .
some of the worst music i &apos;ve ever heard .
so ...
you and will , huh ?
yep , me and will .
i don &apos;t know , actually . he &apos;s got issues .
everybody &apos;s got issues .
no , not him .
that &apos;s what i always used to like about him .
he was fun . a real man .
now , he &apos;s gone all gushy .
why ?
he &apos;s in love .
with you ?
no , not me .
do you think people can change who they &apos;re in love with ?
sure .
people fall out of love all the time .
and then , uh ...
then they fall in love with somebody else .
like a change of address ?
she was surfing his web site .
she was checking out &quot; kent for america . &quot;
yes , and she explained that . after the massage ,
she went home and checked it out ; that makes sense .
i think we should cut her loose .
you don &apos;t believe her ?
i worry about how much she needs to explain .
at a certain point , credulity has been stretched too far .
is this a mistake ?
it &apos;s a process , lara .
we have to go through it .
yeah , my friends will be like ,
&quot; what &apos;re you doing ? &quot; he &apos;s helping women . suck it up .
i thought you were on our side &quot; &quot;
it would make a difference if i had evidence , wouldn &apos;t it ?
well , it &apos;s difficult without it .
i still have to decide whether i want to do this .
i know .
no , i mean , um ...
i &apos;m going to show you something ,
but i still have to decide whether i want to pursue this .
the towel that he ... used afterwards .
that &apos;s the one .
this is unseemly .
it &apos;d take weeks to get dna testing .
even if we got a match ,
it still doesn &apos;t necessarily support her story .
that could have come from an uncontrolled emission from the massage .
we are the dregs of society .
okay , we get it , diane .
you don &apos;t think he did it .
no , that &apos;s not getting it , will .
believing in something bigger than yourself ...
if she was molested by joe kent , then joe kent should pay for what ...
that &apos;s not how it works .
and you know it . he pays for it either way .
he &apos;s innocent , he pays for it . she &apos;s lying , he pays for it .
the 24 @-@ hour news cycle guarantees that .
i think it &apos;s time we approach mr. kent .
his best @-@ case scenario-- this goes away quietly ,
so we try and settle now .
shake him down ?
no , settle before a trial .
it &apos;s what we do every day . it &apos;s what you do every day .
look , i &apos;ll go .
i know mr. kent &apos;s lawyer through a friend .
you have anything ?
she &apos;s behind on her cable , her phone bills , her credit cards .
she needs the money .
anything else ?
uh , her roommate also works as a masseuse at the foreland .
um , the hotel staff is suggesting
that both of &apos; em do a bit more than just massage ,
so i &apos;m there now and i &apos;ll find out how much more .
more as in sexual release ?
that would be my guess .
but we don &apos;t want that ?
well , we want the truth , but that &apos;s not the , uh ...
preferable truth .
right , and the preferable truth is that nothing happened at all ?
but you still want to hear whatever i find out ?
yes .
it &apos;s appealing , running together , peter .
i respected you from afar .
you know that the state &apos;s attorney sets the goals for the department ,
but that it &apos;s the deputy that runs it , so ...
that would be quite a step up from being ...
a lowly staff lawyer ?
that &apos;s all right . that &apos;s what i am .
like i tell my daughters , i &apos;m too big for my britches .
and there &apos;s all that , um ... patronage mr. gold offered .
i think i don &apos;t have that many friends in illinois .
well , in my experience , friendship follows patronage .
the thing is ... peter , i can &apos;t .
my whole reason for running
is to stop this legacy control of the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
and that &apos;s no reflection on you , peter .
i just want to be able to look my daughters in the face .
&apos;cause it &apos;s all about the fountain , right ?
it was so nice meeting you .
and it &apos;ll be fun doing battle .
can &apos;t wait .
you know the one thing i hate more than a backroom deal , eli ,
is a failed backroom deal .
of course , we &apos;d love for this to go away .
the last thing we want to do
is accuse your client on the eve of his nobel prize speech .
we haven &apos;t tested the towel yet for pre @-@ seminal fluid ,
so this is a very good moment to settle this .
settle what ?
our suit .
so , what do you think ?
what do i think ?
i think we can settle this .
right now . just pull down your pants and touch your toes .
don &apos;t make us take this public .
why not ? hey , let &apos;s take it public together .
right now . the tribune &apos;s around the corner .
here &apos;s my card . phone us by 11 : 00 .
what you have , mr. gardner , is a little bitch .
a little cheerleading bitch who &apos;s tired
of turning tricks under the bleachers , and wants to accuse joe kent .
joe kent . say the words to yourself .
who comes out of that fight ?
this is legal malpractice , buddy .
go to hell , you stupid son of a bitch .
you two @-@ bit shakedown leg @-@ breaker .
you come to me with this scam-- this &quot; two encyclopedias for one &quot; scam--
and you expect me to , what ? roll over ? this isn &apos;t bp .
joe kent is a great man .
i &apos;m a bastard . that &apos;s why he hired me .
you don &apos;t deal with him . you deal with me .
you come to the back door , you stupid , number @-@ running ...
you can take that as a &quot; no . &quot;
really ? remind me to never get you angry .
so we get lara to sign the retainer , and we go to the press .
you think he was bluffing ?
i don &apos;t think it matters . we have to move forward .
why ?
his methods aside , he &apos;s not wrong .
we go to the press ,
we &apos;re suddenly the ambulance @-@ chasers of the loop .
you &apos;re thinking about backing off ?
i &apos;m thinking something doesn &apos;t feel right here .
he &apos;s not showing fear .
it &apos;s a tactic .
or it &apos;s real .
we jump and we &apos;re wrong , we make ourselves the story .
how &apos;s that for a pretty picture ?
diane and i are finally on the same side of something .
alicia ...
have kalinda check into other hotels where kent stayed .
if he did it once , he did it other times .
okay , i &apos;ll say &quot; black , &quot; so you can say &quot; white , &quot; okay ?
i want to know the truth .
good . good . we have two more hours . let &apos;s use them .
he wants to endorse peter ?
yes . i know , mr. kent hasn &apos;t endorsed anyone in years ,
but he likes peter &apos;s personal story .
he wants to endorse him .
when can we announce ?
well , he has to travel to stockholm later this week ,
but maybe next week .
great . peter will be ...
he loves mr. kent .
oh , so there &apos;s one more thing .
mr. kent has a thorn in his side .
okay ?
i know
your law firm is lockhart , gardner &amp; bond .
and mr. florrick &apos;s wife &apos;s a key player there ?
well , she &apos;s a second @-@ year associate .
yeah , but the word is lockhart , gardner is peter &apos;s firm .
we need them to back off a case .
is this too hard ?
no . no , it &apos;s fine .
last time i was here ,
i had , uh , lara .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
you know her ?
yeah . mm @-@ hmm .
i , uh ... tipped her a bit extra last time for ...
a bit extra .
is something wrong ?
this is a vip treatment , sir .
the hotel frowns upon ... &quot; something extra . &quot;
and lara ?
well , lara goes her own way .
i mean , she shouldn &apos;t do it ,
but i could give her your number .
sometimes lara does full @-@ body massages outside of work .
she &apos;s jealous .
that &apos;s why she said it .
but she &apos;s your roommate .
yes , but she &apos;s a lmt , too .
and there &apos;s only so many of these vip jobs .
they ... they pay a lot .
and everybody &apos;s fighting for whatever they can get .
sabrina , too .
but she was saying it to a customer
who wanted a sexual massage .
yeah ?
so it seems she was saying something good about you ,
something the customer wanted to hear .
no , no , no . you don &apos;t get it .
lmts call them &quot; one @-@ handed masseuses . &quot;
it hurts their reputations in the big hotels ,
and that &apos;s where the money is .
if i &apos;m known for sexual massages ,
i won &apos;t get the big jobs .
hey , i just wanted to say ...
look , you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t have a plan .
okay , uh , this is strange .
i don &apos;t even know where this came from , but ...
you ready ?
joe kent wants to endorse you .
joe kent ?
yeah .
the joe kent ?
yes . his lawyer just came up to me .
what &apos;s the catch ?
the catch ? there is no catch .
the catch is you say &quot; thank you . &quot;
eli ?
look , nothing that will sully you .
they just want me to talk to my law firm about them dropping a suit .
i &apos;m working on it . don &apos;t worry .
what &apos;s the suit ?
it &apos;s just a nuisance suit against kent .
a sexual harassment suit . don &apos;t worry .
okay . let &apos;s talk to him .
who , kent ?
no , his lawyer .
this time , i want to be sure about the backroom deal .
they &apos;re investigating me , aren &apos;t they ?
yes , i think so .
so this is the way it &apos;ll be if i go through with this ?
reporters will be looking at me , not him ?
yes , probably .
why ?
because they think they know him , and they don &apos;t know you .
yeah . that &apos;s what he said at the state &apos;s attorney office .
who ?
the guy who sent me to you . cary .
cary agos ?
yeah .
he was the one who questioned me and gave me your card .
he said you &apos;d be sympathetic .
peter . peter .
hello , mr. florrick . wilk hobson .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re open to this .
i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t need to tell you ,
an endorsement from mr. kent ,
especially on the heels of his trip to stockholm ,
would be massive .
so all i have to do is get my wife to drop her case ?
yeah , that &apos;s the deal .
this sexual assault is bogus .
you &apos;d be doing everybody a favor .
and when the plaintiff goes to another firm ?
she has an 11 : 00 p.m. meeting with carpton &amp; greene .
it &apos;s a firm in the family .
i have an agreement with them to bury it .
you know what ? it was nice talking to you .
what can i tell mr. kent ?
you can tell him that i hope my wife rips him apart ,
and i think she will , &apos; cause she &apos;s a good lawyer .
either way i know she &apos;ll do the right thing ,
but it was very nice meeting you .
let &apos;s discuss this .
now , i know he &apos;s got another bail hearing in an hour ,
so i ask for a review of the plea .
that &apos;s very funny .
okay ?
hold on , this is going to be great .
all right .
well , hello .
cary , you sent us a client , didn &apos;t you ?
i did .
derrick bond .
oh , that &apos;s right ,
you guys have been going through some mergers over there . cary agos .
i seem to have just missed your time with us .
so what &apos;s up with lara white ?
what &apos;s up ? she said she was assaulted .
and yet state &apos;s attorney booted the case ,
and you sent her right to us .
right , i suggested she pursue a civil path .
why ?
because i think lara was assaulted by joe kent ,
and i think mr. childs made a mistake booting the case
and i think i wanted justice done .
and you &apos;re just going to help us out ?
yeah , why wouldn &apos;t i ?
what makes you think mr. kent did it ?
history . get kalinda on it .
she is .
good , get her to look up previous assaults .
and what might she find ?
meredith bordinay .
take the case . it &apos;s a good one .
what do you think ? i think he still wants to hurt us .
i &apos;ll catch up .
i &apos;m very sorry ...
what happened to you ?
i got in a fistfight .
that &apos;s a turn @-@ on .
i know , that &apos;s why i did it .
i like you , will .
i don &apos;t like you when you &apos;re serious .
i know .
you got a little ...
i &apos;ll stay with you as long as it &apos;s fun .
as soon as you fall in love with me , it &apos;s over .
okay ?
okay .
you can do that again .
peter . peter .
excuse me .
all right .
he did it . i don &apos;t believe it .
he sent me an e @-@ mail ; he endorsed you .
who ?
kent .
he must have overruled his lawyer or something ,
but he endorsed you .
do you know what a kent endorsement means ?
it means women .
it means african @-@ american women , caucasian women .
in one fell swoop , it takes care of the amber madison problem .
oh , god .
what ?
he &apos;s tying himself to us .
kent-- he &apos;s tying our fates together .
right now i &apos;m being endorsed by a secular saint ,
but if the suit goes through ,
i &apos;m being endorsed by a sexual deviant .
right , right .
he &apos;s forcing you to call alicia off .
kent was speaking at uc santa cruz .
he stayed at the scotts valley lodge .
he requested a vip massage
and apparently asked the masseuse , a meredith bordinay ,
for some sexual contact .
and you trust this information ?
i spoke to the masseuse herself .
she had complained to management ,
but when they didn &apos;t do anything about it , she dropped it .
the statute of limitations have since passed so can &apos;t bring suit .
will she testify ?
she &apos;s fragile , but i &apos;m working on it .
what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s another masseuse .
the same thing .
bummer .
i &apos;ll go talk to lara .
no , i will .
ms. lockhart , there &apos;s a call for you .
ask if i can call back .
no , it &apos;s ms. kent . joe kent &apos;s wife .
hello , mrs. kent ?
yes , is this diane ?
it is .
i ... is everything all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
i wanted to talk to you about this suit you &apos;re thinking of bringing .
okay .
i want to ask you to not .
mrs. kent , i &apos;m sorry , but this--
it &apos;s a bit unorthodox .
i just wanted to mention joe &apos;s work in the congo ,
how important it is .
do you know about it , diane ?
i do .
i hope you do , diane .
good work requires money , and this isn &apos;t just good work .
this is essential work .
women are dying there , thousands of women .
this is not just a wife pleading for her husband , diane .
joe can survive the embarrassment .
this suit will destroy our efforts in africa .
mrs. kent , i &apos;m sorry , i respect you mightily ,
i respect your husband , but i can &apos;t let this sway me .
why not ?
this woman-- what is she , who is she ?
did your husband do it , ma &apos;am ?
mrs. kent ?
my husband moves people .
my husband has made his life this cause .
does it matter ? does it matter if he did it ?
doesn &apos;t it matter to you ?
no . i can say that with a clear conscience .
the world needs my husband .
it doesn &apos;t matter to me .
thank you , mrs. kent .
diane , don &apos;t do this .
please , it &apos;s wrong .
good @-@ bye .
i &apos;ll be right back .
that good , huh ?
the goal is not to have heroes .
really ?
i thought the goal was to die with the most money .
it &apos;s almost 11 : 00 . where are we ?
diane doesn &apos;t have heroes anymore ,
and the firm is going to be trounced tomorrow
for dragging a saint into the gutter .
you can tell lara we &apos;re taking her case .
good . thanks .
so ... carpton &amp; greene ?
no , heading home .
we tried to do too much in one night , lara .
get some sleep , then give me a call in the morning .
uh , no , i &apos;m done .
we found another masseuse he molested .
she didn &apos;t bring charges ?
no , same thing happened to her .
she was giving him a massage , and he attacked her .
why didn &apos;t she bring charges ?
she was afraid .
and four years later this happens to you .
we &apos;ve only been looking into this a few hours ,
so there could be more women .
then they need to do this , because i can &apos;t .
lara , please just call me tomorrow .
everything you went through--
all the press , all the people talking about you--
was it hard ?
yes .
and it goes on ?
yes .
they &apos;ll look into me--
the reporters and everyone-- and ...
they &apos;ll find stuff
because there is stuff .
my parents , my sister .
people really don &apos;t want to believe this about him .
i don &apos;t want to believe this about him , so ...
i just won &apos;t .
