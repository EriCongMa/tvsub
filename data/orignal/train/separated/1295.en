Oh, how's mine?
Yeah, I knew the beginning part,
so I felt good about that.
Well, I didn't have enough time for both of the essays,
but I still think I did really well.
I'll call you back.
I think what we're looking for in...
OK, everybody. Right this way.
Single file.
Oh, crap.
I forgot today was her annual
career-day dog-and-pony show.
Detective Rizzoli,
These are the students
from the Elizabeth Bishop middle school.
Are we almost done? I've got a lot of homework.
Who here wants to be a detective?
They must all want to be doctors.
I wanted to go to Tweenbeat magazine,
But that was full.
Okay.
Well, welcome.
Over here, uh, we have a...
a shoe print from a crime scene.
So we made a plaster cast --
Was it a murder?
Uh, yes.
Awesome. Was it disgusting?
What's that?
That's the shot alert.
And that computer software
can triangulate the sound of a gunshot
and find its precise location.
Gunshots at Boston Cambridge University.
What?!
Awesome. Somebody else is dead.
Wait, no, Jane, I'm going with you.
BCU is my alma mater.
What about them?
They...wanted to be at some Tween magazine, anyway.
Let's go find your parents.
Ugh. Speaking of parents...
What is it, ma?
No, I can't. I'm working.
Your father left me stranded on the side of the road.
Just get in the car, ma.
I'm sure he got stuck at a job or something, okay?
Why do you always take his side?
Here we go.
I'm not taking his side.
He's too busy to fix my car.
He's got so many other better things to do!
Can we talk about this when I'm not working?
So, you know, I never told you,
but I'd be really good at solving cases.
Well, the forensic sciences can be quite complicated.
A little common sense goes a long way.
I've read so many crime novels,
and I always know who did it.
Thank you, Agatha Christie.
Stay in the car.
I won't embarrass you.
30 years of experience says otherwise.
College campuses are like a foreign country to me.
You went to junior college.
That's like 13th, 14th grade.
But, Jane, you know so much.
So why doesn't it feel like enough?
You're trampling on a crime scene. You got tape?
No, ma'am.
Go into my car.
In the trunk, there's tape. Get it.
And, hey, tell the woman who's in there to stay put.
In the...trunk?
No, in the car!
White female, approximately 20.
Gunshot wound to the chest.
No vitals.
Barney Fife was first on scene?
Yeah.
No witnesses.
Broad daylight, thousands of students, no witnesses?
Hey, they're all taking finals. And look where she is.
You wanna go back to being partners, just say so.
Can you please get a gun dog,
and look through all the dumpsters,
the trash cans, and the bushes?
Padding for a laptop, but no computer.
Maybe she didn't have one.
Nobody really goes to college without one.
Maybe the shooter stole it.
"Danielle Davis."
Have her dorm room sealed off.
Look at this.
Maybe it's hers.
All the texts have been deleted.
Get a subpoena to the D.A.'s office
for her phone records, all right?
A piece of plastic.
Get this to the crime lab.
No. No, no.
No, no, no, no.
You look like my mother,
but she's supposed to be waiting for me in the car.
It's a tragedy.
She's somebody's baby.
How do you do this every day?
Okay, I'm gonna have a uni take you home.
It's senseless.
Yes, it is. Go on.
Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Just stay right here, okay?
Right here. Right here. Did you know her?
She's my best friend!
When was the last time you saw her?
We had lunch yesterday at south campus...
Okay.
Is there anybody you can think of
that would have reason to do this?
Did she have a boyfriend?
She wasn't seeing anyone.
I can't believe she's gone!
I'm sorry.
Okay. All right.
第一季 第四集
No computer. Somebody's got her laptop.
Wonder what this opens?
Uh, her locker at the gym.
I'm Lucas Bilton. I was Danielle's R.A.
Resident advisor. They look after kids in the dorm.
How well did you know her?
Not that well.
She ever come by and talk to you
about having a problem with anybody?
She stopped by once or twice about classes.
She was usually either studying or playing soccer.
All right. Here's my card.
If you think of anything, can you give me a call, please?
I'm Danielle's father.
She wanted to get into BCU since she was a little kid.
The day she found out was the best day of her life.
When was the last time you spoke to your daughter?
Two days ago.
She, uh,
she sounded pretty tired, but she had a lot on her plate.
Straight-A student. Played Division-I soccer.
They recruited her. Full scholarship.
You must have been very proud of her.
Oh, her mother and I were very proud, yeah.
Her mother died when she was 15.
I didn't know how I was gonna be able to afford to send her.
She did it all herself.
Would you like one of my officers to drive you home?
Yeah.
I just want you to find out who did this to my baby.
2-centimeter, singular gunshot wound, mid-chest.
I bet we're looking for a 9-millimeter.
I'll have ballistics confirm. I just like to guess.
And I'm usually right.
Gunned down at one of the best universities in the country.
I loved every minute there.
Well, maybe not protein biochemistry.
Shooter was close.
I found a hair on her body.
Give it to the crime lab.
See if they find DNA.
Well-developed quadricep femoris.
Yeah, she was a division-I soccer player.
Did you play sports?
Ballet and fencing.
Those aren't sports.
Yes, they are.
What did you play?
Field hockey. I was an attacker.
I'm sure you were very aggressive.
"Attacker" is a position.
Maura...
...She died from a gunshot wound to the chest.
Since when is the chest bone connected to the ankle bone?
The anterior inferior tibiofibular
syndesmotic ligament is ruptured.
Sounds painful.
Probably hurt her to walk.
It's an unusual injury.
You see it in professional athletes.
Her doctors missed it. She needed surgery.
Then how was she playing division-I soccer?
Well, she wasn't.
She wasn't playing soccer on this ankle for a while.
So our scholar-athlete was lying.
Why?
Wow, she was a talented player.
Danielle was my game girl,
no attitude,
hard worker.
Was she having problems with any of the teamates?
No, not that I know.
Her biggest problem was high-ankle sprain.
That actually was no sprain, it was torn ligament
No wonder she didn't respond to rehab.
Could you tell us where her locker was?
I would like to look inside.
Not ours.
We have combo locks.
If you think of anything helpful,
please give us a call. Thanks.
Yeah.
I really liked her.
Killed me to have to pull her scholarship.
Well, you cut her from the team when she got hurt?
And pull her scholarship?
My hands were tied.
Well, they kick her out?
No, the tution is paid off.
How was that possible? Her scholarship was pulled.
Straight from the bursar's office.
Paid it off herself in a lump sum.
W-- holy cr-- $57,000 a year?!
Includes room and board.
That should include a car.
That should include an all-expense-paid trip around the world.
Hell of a lot of money to wear a toga and do jell-o shots.
通常由床单做成 这种派对在美加的大学校园里很流行
Right?
Where'd you go to college, Korsak?
Didn't.
Watched "Animal House" a few times.
Course you did.
Got someing, Jane.
That was a good place to kill someone.
Camera's blocked. Our suspect knows the campus.
What about the security officer?
Barney Fife? Clean. No record.
The cellphone company came back with Danielle's texts.
All that money for school and that's how she writes?
"2gtbt"?
"Too good to be true." It's called "Texting."
It's so complicated my mother does it in a nursing home!
I'm looking at the pages,
it looks like more than friend.
Who's "B-bear"?
There's a lot of texts from this guy.
"Miss u." "Love u, babe."
"Call me."
"B-bear." Brandon Lewis.
Sophomore.
Now, why didn't Natalie tell me
that Danielle have a boyfriend?
Because they broke up a month ago.
Why?
He was stressing her.
What do you mean?
She said she didn't have time for a boyfriend.
And how did he feel about that?
Brandon's a good guy...
But?
It was pretty sudden.
He was pissed.
I don't understand.
She had even less time when she was playing soccer.
How did you know she was cut from the team?
How did you know?
She told me.
She was really sad.
She said she felt like she lost herself.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
She didn't want her dad to know.
Was she sad about breaking it off with Brandon?
Ever since she got hurt playing soccer,
she was sad about everything.
Unh-unh. Boston homicide.
Brandon Lewis here?
I thought this was a frat house.
It is.
We're getting ready for a party.
In the middle of the day?
We just finished finals.
Congratulations.
Excuse us.
Do you think their parents know
they're spending $1,000 an hour
for them to dress in foil?
Hi. Can you get Brandon Lewis for us, please?
Thank you.
Okay, w-- why are you wearing this?
ABC party.
Anything but clothes?
You Brandon?
Yeah. Is this about Danielle?
I'm not some gangbanger.
I'm pre-law.
We'll try to keep that in mind.
When did you and Danielle break up?
She broke up with me a month ago.
Why?
I don't know.
Dig a little...
...Pre-law.
Must be teaching you some analytical skills.
I said, "I don't know."
Was she seeing someone else?
No.
Why? Do you know something?
Come on, Brandon.
A girl that looked like Danielle,
they're not alone very long.
How would you feel if she was seeing someone else?
Really happy. What do you think?
I think a man gets enraged
and he does things that he regrets.
I-I'm not some homicidal maniac!
I-I loved her. Why would I kill her?
I don't know, Brandon. Why would you?
You can't pin this on me.
I want a lawyer.
Took him long enough.
Is this from the good fridge or the dead-people fridge?
Cold air is cold air.
How old is it?
No, don't tell me.
I-I'm too hungry.
I was at BCU.
The sorority girls were dressed in foil.
The ABC party.
Such a rho zeta theta thing.
You take it for granted that you know all that.
Well, I didn't know "Attacker" Was a position.
A gaping hole in your education.
I try not to have regrets...
But, I don't know.
W-when I was on that campus, I...
I felt like I missed out.
Jane, you're a bright, accomplished woman.
I peeked in the library.
All the things I could have known if I'd gone to college.
Something about being there was...
It was inspiring, you know?
But you know more about human beings than anyone I know.
Bad human beings.
We're all a mix of good and bad.
Hey, ma. What is it now?
What is this?
Well, your father wouldn't help me, so I traded in my car.
Were you semiconscious at the time?
Don't be condescending.
Oh, wow.
It's a 429-cubic-inch, uh, v-8.
It's a very efficient engine for its time.
40 years ago.
I-I-is this about teaching Papa some lesson?
Well, that... May have been part of it.
Smoke, uh, is leaking
from your valve-cover gasket,
But I-I could replace that for you.
But I-I do see some other problems.
You're burning oil.
I would suspect it's a ring job.
How much?
Uh, three, maybe four.
Hundred?
Thousand.
Oh!
Oh, god. Your father is gonna kill me.
Tell him not to do it while I'm on call.
Can you help me get the Buick back?
They're crooks, and you're a police officer!
I'm a homicide detective!
Ma, wh-- are you planning on killing the car dealer?!
I might.
Is it driveable?
Maybe a few miles.
Fine. Let's call you a cab.
Hey, hey.
Ran down that barcode key
we found in Danielle's dorm room.
You found something.
It opens a locker at a high-end gym in Somerville.
Danielle stored a nice dress...
And, uh...
...some "Do-me" heels in a secret locker.
That was not her only secret.
I think I know how
our innocent sophomore made $57,000.
She lost her scholorship
and when tuition was due, I'm figuring
that Danielle was turning tricks for no more than a month.
How'd she put that kind of money together in a month?
Well, I mean, she'd have to have some pretty high-end clients.
Come on. We're taking this.
A little undercover field trip to an expert.
A pimp?
Yeah, well, she had to be working with someone
to make that kind of cash, right?
Can I drive?
Yeah, knock yourself out.
Maybe Danielle had, like, a very rich sugar daddy.
Maybe B-bear found out why she didn't have time for him
and killed her.
I need me a little taste of this vanilla bitch right here.
How much for a party?
Three to five years.
Oh, my bad.
But 5-0 looking fine!
Get out of here. Uh-huh.
Leave it to my mother to trade her Buick in for a pimp mobile.
Okay, there's my expert.
He was a really good source
when I worked this sector.
Maybe he can tell us
how Danielle was hooking up with her johns.
Hey, man.
Oh, it's Rizzoli.
Who died?
Detective Frost, this is Mo monee.
Your, uh,
your ride needs work.
It's my mother's.
Oh, damn. Mama's got some gangsta.
She one of yours?
I wish. Girl like that could earn.
Maybe she had a pimp.
Maybe you could find out for us.
She was a college student.
Man, it ain't like it used to be.
Bitches be trippin' now, gettin' their own websites.
All kinds of amateurs up in this game.
Maybe she was solo.
No, if she was working regular,
she had herself a daddy.
And a book.
You check her book?
We didn't find one.
she had a book.
I mean, this whole damn world's gone crazy,
But whores still need to keep schedule.
Hello.
You've got a great eye.
This one's in tip-top...
Okay, what's this about?
That is your car.
This is my mother's car.
Yeah, I'm afraid I can't do that.
That lemon that you sold her
needs thousands of dollars of work.
According to the law, we're not responsible
for abuse, negligence, or accident
once the car leaves our lot.
Right, the law.
How about you showing me all your 140-58 documents
that shows that you have the bonds for all these cars?
Also, let's get out your titles
so we can verify the vin numbers.
What do you say, uh, Roger?
We want all our customers to have a satisfactory experience.
I'm sure we could rescind the sale.
Throw in a new alternator, all right?
I don't think that will be a problem.
And floor mats.
It'll be our pleasure.
I didn't think that you talked like that to anybody but me.
Is that mom-speak for "Thank you"?
Dr. Maura Isles, knuckle-deep
in germy bar snacks?
I'm shocked.
Oh, I had representative samples tested.
Bacteria count fell within acceptable limits.
You want one?
It must be very complicated to be you.
You have no idea.
I had to get out of the office.
Me too.
I feel guilty taking a break. We don't have a solid lead.
We might.
I got the lab results back
from that hair sample I found on danielle.
It's synthetic. From a toupee.
Danielle was selling herself to a guy with a plastic rug?
Maybe he took it off, you know, during.
God, a child at the college of her dreams,
and she's turning tricks.
To stay. You know, she lost her scholarship.
She was trying to pay for school.
How about a loan? Hell, some people even flip burgers.
Not possible.
Why?
Because there are only 8,760 hours in a year,
and to pay for school,
she needed to work 9,500 hours.
You're defending her.
Your fancy French boarding school warped your young mind.
In Europe, women make all kinds of arrangements with men.
And both parties get what they need.
No shame,
no pimps, no victims.
I'm sure it was terrible for Danielle to resort to that.
She had other choices.
Apparently she didn't think so.
She couldn't go to her father.
Jane, what is it?
You're right.
H-her father was very upset that he couldn't
keep her in that school without that scholarship.
You know that piece of plastic
you found at the crime scene?
It's Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene.
From a computer.
Danielle's missing laptop.
I bet the person who stole it dropped it.
And I bet the campus computer store can tell us who that is.
Wait, what are you gonna do?
Sit outside and wait for it to open?
Yeah, I might. I'll see you later.
Anybody bring in a laptop for repairs
within the past 24 hours?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see the repair slips, please?
That's this morning's.
You need yesterday's, too?
Yes, please.
Hey, Officer Kelly.
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Don't run from the cops!
Oh, look at this.
Laptop-repair slip.
You want to bet it's Danielle's?
I didn't kill her.
You had her laptop.
I found it.
After you killed her.
She was dead when I got there.
I grabbed it, put it in the cruiser,
and then I went to call it in.
So your only crime is stealing from the dead girl?
Look...
It stinks that she's dead.
But she's not gonna miss the laptop, right?
You're gonna miss your bed.
Take him to lockup.
Cheez doodles or chewy bears?
So hard to choose.
You better have the protein bar, detective.
Thanks a lot.
You told me to remind you.
I think I found Danielle's hooker book.
It's on her laptop.
That's her calendar. See all these entries?
I think they're code for Johns she was meeting.
Uh, that looks like a college student making notes to herself.
Except she wasn't taking art history.
I don't know. M-maybe he's right.
Look, she, uh, she records historical dates,
but always as "1700," "1800."
That's -- that's military time.
Look at this one -- "2100."
She was probably taking "Future U.S. History,"
Right, Korsak?
Her texts to Brandon stopped about a month ago.
That's -- that's right when these entries begin.
Look at this.
The night before she died...
"Windgate act passed by AH, 2100."
Yeah, there's a Windgate Hotel downtown.
Maybe AH stayed there.
Wild-goose chase, you ask me.
No one's asking you. I'll go, Jane.
Okay.
Hotel-security footage.
That him? The bad rug?
Wild-goose chase, huh, Korsak?
Didn't find anything.
Oh, except...
...one of Danielle's Johns.
But we're probably not interested
in the guy she was with the day she was murdered.
All right, you've had your fun.
I was wrong, okay? So, sue me.
"AH" is Professor Andrew Hilliard?
Hilliard sold his house in Cambridge last month.
Been renting cheap, school-owned housing
for the past few months.
Sold his house?
You think Danielle was shaking him down for tuition money?
Like she's trying to wipe away what she'd become.
Tell Rizzoli.
She'll be delighted to get this creep.
Professor Hilliard.
Boston P.D. We're coming in.
We got a deco.
Smells a lot like day two.
You gonna hurl again?
You want me to kiss him on the lips?
Glock 26.
It's the same gun that got danielle.
Serial numbers are filed.
Why did he kill Danielle? Jealousy?
Maybe.
Then he kills himself 'cause he can't live with what he did.
Except...
Except?
Except it's a setup.
Hardly any blood on his gun hand.
Yeah, there's none on the slide either.
This isn't a suicide.
Hi. I'm going to the crime lab.
I'll ride with you.
Maura measured the entrance and the exit wounds.
Hilliard didn't kill himself.
He was shot by somebody right next to him.
His broker confirmed
Hilliard's been withdrawing $15,000 a month.
That's $180,000 -- for what?
No idea.
But it's been going on for a year and a half.
So, the professor starts seeing student prostitutes...
And somebody starts blackmailing him.
Yeah, but i-it couldn't have been Danielle.
She'd been a scholarship soccer player up until the last month.
Striations match.
Same gun killed Danielle and Hilliard.
Tracing this gun is our best hope of finding the shooter.
How?
Serial numbers were filed off.
Just because your bright, shiny objects can't do it
Doesn't mean it can't be done.
Hey, Maura.
Let's get to the university.
Danielle's friends are throwing her a candlelight vigil.
I want to get there early, all right?
Oh, I'd like to come with you, pay my respects,
Maybe help you look for the bad guy.
They like to see the results of their work.
I know because I had two years of forensic psychiatry.
It took you two years
to figure out that bad guys were screwed up?
It's beautiful... in a sad way.
Just keep looking at faces.
Hello, detective.
Some turnout, huh?
Yeah, it's a tribute to the kind of person your daughter was.
We are doing our best. I promise.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
You got something?
Yeah. The numbers off the gun.
It's registered to Scott Bilton,
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
Bilton?
Lucas, the R.A., Bilton?
His stepfather.
Be careful. He's got three other guns registered.
Okay. Thanks.
Murder weapon's traced to the R.A.
That kid's the killer?
Of course -- R.A.S keep tabs on their floors.
And he would know that she lost her scholarship,
that she was desperate.
Looks like his part-time job was pimping.
Let's wait till this thing is over.
We'll get him when he's alone, okay?
Maura, stay here.
Okay.
Look at the bracelet. It's the same as Danielle's.
Natalie was hooking, too.
I loved Danielle.
Anything I can say about this remarkable person
won't come close to describing who she was.
Gun!
Drop it!
You killed Danielle!
She couldn't keep her mouth shut.
Don't think I won't kill you, too.
Please.
Jane, go! I got her!
That's ok, that's ok, I'm here
Lucas!
She was a whore, and she was a whiner!
I gave her 57 grand, and she didn't want to do it anymore?!
You work it off, bitch!
Just put the gun down! We can talk about this!
Or I'll just blow your head off.
He's running!
Frost.
I'm with you.
Well...Good to see you with your eyes open.
It's good to be going home.
How you feeling?
Eh, my ribs are a little sore.
Bullet was a "Through and through."
It's better than most case scenarios.
I know.
Bullet broke two ribs, came right back out.
I guess I passed out from shock.
It just hurts to laugh or cough.
Well, at least you'll have a cool scar.
Doctor said just two pucker marks.
Oh, good. So then you can continue to wear foil bikinis.
Don't make me laugh.
Sorry.
Here. These are for you.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Let's get you out of here.
Are you gonna tell my parents?
that you got shot?
Well, I think they already know.
Thank you.
I was really desperate, and...
and it was really stupid.
Well, everybody does stupid things.
That stupid?
Okay, no. Maybe not that stupid.
But you're here.
And you get a second chance.
When do you go back to school?
I don't.
I can't pay.
And I can't do what I was doing....
...ever.
Oh. Here.
What's this?
Open it.
Weird, huh?
I talked to the Bursar's office.
They said you were paid all the way up to your senior year.
How -- but --
There's always a little
leftover scholarship money for hardship cases.
I argued that your case was a major hardship.
Thank you.
You study hard, okay?
Yeah.
See you soon. Take care.
So, what was it like working on a live victim?
Terrifying.
And exhilarating.
Natalie confirmed your theory though.
Lucas had about a half-dozen girls working off tuition.
Yeah. Lucas was the company store.
Fronted the money to Danielle.
Maybe she found out that he was blackmailing the professor,
And he killed her.
Yeah. She probably thought she could get out
if she threatened to go public.
That poor father. What he must be going through.
I applied to BCU.
It's very hard to get into.
I got in.
Why didn't you go?
Wanted to be a cop.
What's the real reason?
My father would have sold everything to send me there.
I couldn't do that to him.
Did you ever tell him?
Nope. That would make him too sad.
Well, I wonder what's gonna happen to Natalie.
She's going back to school.
What?
Made a little deal with the chancellor.
We keep a lid on it, they go back to school.
On the university's expense.
'cause, you know, if this got out,
people might be judgmental.
What are you gonna tell Danielle's father?
All he needs to know
is that his daughter loved him very much.
Aww, Jane.
What?
I think that's really...
That's really sweet.
Oh, gross. Okay. Gimme the wine.
