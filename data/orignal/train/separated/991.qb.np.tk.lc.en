paul was shocked to find felisha was back on the lane .
well , hello , paul .
tom &apos;s new job came with perks .
you know what you can do on a private jet ?
anything .
a relationship was forced to end .
we are no longer friends , not you and me ,
and not you and gaby .
you can &apos;t speak for me .
i just did .
and susan got her transplant , thanks to paul .
i &apos;m sure as i sign the papers , they &apos;ll be contacting you .
after susan delfino &apos;s
kidney transplant , her doctor ordered her
to abstain from sex ...
for six weeks .
but what the doctor couldn &apos;t prevent susan from doing ...
was dreaming about it .
these dreams were filled with torrid caresses ...
with passionate kisses ...
and with soft cries of ecstasy .
the only thing missing from these dreams ...
was her husband .
are you okay ?
uh ... yeah , i just ...
had a dream .
yeah , i know .
you know ? what do you know ?
was i saying something ? was i talking ?
more like moaning .
oh , moaning ! oh , god .
yeah , you mentioned him , too .
oh , don &apos;t be embarrassed .
so you had a sex dream .
it &apos;s not surprising given
how long we &apos;ve had to lay off .
tell me ... what were we doing ?
uh ... we ...
hey , maybe we could recreate it
when we end our drought in 2 days , 17 hours ,
and 35 minutes .
well , uh ... needless to say , it was some pretty kinky stuff .
like , did we-- did we do that thing--
that thing we talked about ?
mike , it was my dream , not yours .
oh , god , i &apos;m desperate . can you give me some details ?
uh ... or could show you in 2 days , 17 hours ,
and 34 minutes .
that &apos;ll work .
i can &apos;t wait .
well send m.j. to mrs. mccluskey &apos;s ,
and have the whole night together .
yes , susan was having dreams about sex .
just the two of us .
uh @-@ huh . just me and ...
you .
and they were becoming a nightmare .
the residents of wisteria lane are nothing if not loyal .
they love their country .
they root for the home team ...
they support their favorite brand .
but the fiercest loyalty on wisteria lane
is the one between friends .
all right . i gotta run . i &apos;m meeting the girls for coffee .
stop .
which girls ? will bree be there ?
she better be . she &apos;s buying .
then you &apos;re not going .
wait . you were serious about us never speaking to bree again ?
that woman sat our table , spent the holidays with us ,
all the while knowing her son ran over my mother .
yeah , i &apos;m serious .
fine , then you stop talking to her .
but you &apos;re not gonna control me , &apos; cause i have the secret weapon .
you &apos;ll withhold sex ? please .
you always fold before i do .
that &apos;s not true .
the last time you tried , you got so turned on
telling me what you weren &apos;t gonna do to me ,
you wound up doing it to me right then .
damn it .
well , you &apos;re still not gonna stop me
from seeing bree .
yes , i am .
our relationship with that woman is over ,
and i forbid you to see her again .
he forbid me . who is he to forbid me ?
i mean , what is this , 19 ...
whenever it was that husbands got to forbid their wives ?
gaby , he has every reason to be upset .
i hate to say this ,
but i think we should keep our distance for a while .
what ? i &apos;m not giving in to this .
i &apos;ve already caused carlos so much pain .
i think it &apos;s the only thing we can do .
so what are you saying ?
no more poker ?
no more lunches ?
no more shopping ?
i &apos;ll miss it as much as you do .
oh , really ? doesn &apos;t sound like it .
i think this is easy for you .
easy ?
i wanna come over there right now ,
so you can drag me to the mall kicking and screaming ,
but we can &apos;t .
i have to go . i have scones in the oven .
i love your scones .
stop .
good @-@ bye , gaby .
you &apos;re not hanging up .
but i have to .
hey , lynette ! you &apos;re not gonna believe this . i ...
i had to walk paige around the block
eight times to get her down .
nothing is so important that you need to raise your voice .
not even this ?
weisman leadership conference ?
seriously ?
you &apos;re invited ? !
and so are you .
oh , my god !
warren buffett goes to this conference ,
and bill gates and oprah--
it &apos;s one of her favorite things .
oh ! look at this ! all the great speakers .
plus they &apos;ve got the spa , and--
and no kids , right ? no kids ?
no kids .
yes ! yes !
you take her . i gotta figure out what to wear .
hey , you two ! thanks for watching him .
hey , can you watch him again on wednesday ?
mike and i are--
yeah , i know . your big night , huh ?
mike told you ?
didn &apos;t have to .
i caught him staring at my cleavage .
so ... post @-@ transplant sex , huh ?
if it &apos;s as good as my post @-@ cancer sex ,
you &apos;re in for a treat .
fingers crossed .
hey , have you looked at your old house lately ?
it &apos;s kind of a wreck .
does look a little neglected .
you should go over and talk to paul . i &apos;ll watch m.j.
oh . i ... can &apos;t do that .
um , i mean , he might be in the middle of something .
or he might be hanging from the showerhead .
do me a favor and check .
&apos;cause if he &apos;s dead in there , i live downwind .
susan ?
paul ?
paul . uh ... hi there .
um ... i @-@ i was just in the neighborhood ,
and it--and it looked like things were piling up ,
and would you mind closing that robe , please ?
oh , sorry . and sorry about the mess .
i haven &apos;t been getting out of the house much .
you look thin . are you eating ?
yes .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m a little behind on my chores .
so if there &apos;s nothing else ...
paul , um ... are you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yes , susan . fit as a fiddle .
good @-@ bye .
i &apos;ve already spotted two ex @-@ senators
and three covers of &quot; forbes . &quot;
everybody here is definitely a @-@ list .
oh ! bob ! lee !
hey , hey , you fancy hotshots .
hi !
hiya .
hi .
glad you &apos;ve done this conference before ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m definitely gonna need somebody
to show me the ropes .
nothing to it . just don &apos;t talk politics .
and don &apos;t push warren buffett in the pool .
i didn &apos;t push him . he got between me
and the margarita bar .
oh , let me introduce you to barry weisman .
prepare to endure the single most bone @-@ crushing handshake
of your life .
bye .
come on .
well , with this line , it &apos;s gonna be hard to get drunk .
lesson one-- the power of the words
&quot; the president &apos;s council of economic advisors
want their martinis now . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s a little trick i learned
when i was too cheap to buy my own newspapers .
how fantastic is it that chris cavanaugh is speaking ?
i thought &quot; flashpoint &quot; was the best business book
of the year .
i agree .
i &apos;ve heard him speak before . he &apos;s even better in person .
we &apos;re in for a treat tomorrow .
meg bulter , president of amtech .
uh , lynette scavo .
my husband is the c.f.o. of morris technologies .
oh . you &apos;re a plus one .
what &apos;s that mean ?
unfortunately , it means you won &apos;t be seeing chris cavanaugh .
the seminars are only for participants .
wha--
what am i gonna be doing ?
i will tell you what-- japanese flower arranging .
did i weep at the simple beauty of my design last year ?
yes , i did .
i don &apos;t want to arrange flowers .
why are they dividing us up like this ?
maybe it &apos;s because some of us spent our lives
working our way up the corporate ladder ,
and others just married someone who did .
excuse me .
oh , no .
that &apos;s--
wow . that is ridiculous .
i really want to see those seminars .
hey , don &apos;t worry .
you are going to love what they have planned for us .
attention !
if i could have all of my plus ones find a buddy ,
we &apos;re going to get to know each other with a scavenger hunt .
bree .
gaby . what are you doing here ?
i just came by to talk to lynette .
oh , she &apos;s out of town .
she asked me to water the plants and collect the mail .
you look good .
you , too .
new coat ?
you noticed .
i should go .
can &apos;t you just stay and talk ?
maybe have a cup of coffee ?
gaby , we shouldn &apos;t .
it &apos;s just coffee , bree .
but your husband ...
he &apos;d never look for us here .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s been really hard for me not seeing you .
aw , it &apos;s been hard for me , too ,
especially with lynette out of town .
i mean , there &apos;s susan , of course ,
but lately whatever topic you bring up ,
she manages to steer it right back to kidneys .
tell me about it .
well , i guess i ... could put on a pot .
i like mine with cream .
i know how you like it .
hello , karen .
felicia . hi .
when did they let you out ?
about a week ago .
i just stopped by because i wanted you to have this .
it belonged to my sister , and ...
she was always so fond of you .
that &apos;s sweet .
it &apos;s my small way of saying thanks
for keeping my secret all those years .
yeah , not much a secret anymore .
don &apos;t i know it .
but i &apos;ve kept your secret .
i never told a soul about your role that night ,
and i never will .
it &apos;s not really a good time to talk about that .
i understand .
but i hope you &apos;ll stop by my place sometime .
we have so much catching up to do .
sure . i &apos;ll do that .
uh , wh @-@ where are you staying ?
haven &apos;t you heard ? i &apos;m moving in next door .
we &apos;re going to be neighbors .
who was that ?
just an old friend .
old friend ? you look like you &apos;ve seen a ghost .
make me a drink , will you , sweetie ?
toby !
here , kitty , kitty .
toby ! where are you ?
here , kitty , kitty !
toby !
oh , felicia , help me out .
ida greenberg &apos;s lost her stupid cat again .
what happened to you ? is that blood ?
you never saw me . i have to go .
your hand ! let me call you an ambulance .
you love my sister , right ?
martha ? y @-@ yeah .
and you know paul young murdered her ?
there &apos;s no doubt in my mind .
oh , my god .
did you kill paul ?
no !
he killed me .
what ?
they &apos;ll find my blood in his house and
my fingers in the car ,
and he &apos;ll spend the rest of his life prison
if you say you never saw me .
don &apos;t ask me to do this .
please , karen !
paul got away with martha &apos;s murder ,
but ... he won &apos;t get away with mine .
toby .
here , kitty , kitty !
ikebana is all about bringing together nature and humanity .
the three main branches ,
or shushi , represent chi-- earth ,
ten-- heaven , and jin-- man .
interesting . nothing to represent woman .
how about this insignificant clump of moss ?
we could stuff it down at the bottom ,
where it will only speak when spoken to .
does my chi look a little droopy ?
did you hear me ?
yes .
yes , lynette , i heard you .
i heard you during yoga , during the fashion show ,
all through salsa dancing-- &quot; life is unfair . &quot;
ol ?
well , i &apos;m sorry , but i came here
to learn new things and meet interesting people ,
not to pretend that putting sticks in a vase is art .
are we still having a problem ?
yes , we still are .
doesn &apos;t it piss you all off
that we &apos;re stuck in our gilded cage ,
forbidden to go to interesting seminars
just because we &apos;re plus ones ?
no .
this is fun . i really feel like i &apos;m in japan .
this is the united states of america in the 21st centery ,
not some oppressive patriarchal regime .
it may be small and red ,
but this lanyard is no better than a burka !
oh , dear .
we need to storm the gates
and demand to be let inside !
if you &apos;re not gonna use the rest of your flowers , can i--
come on ! rise up ! if we do it together ,
we will not be denied !
4 : 00 , people !
i think you &apos;ve all earned a cocktail .
no . no !
no , do not drink those !
those are the--the cocktails of oppression ,
make from equal parts tyranny and blind obedience , and ...
oh , screw it .
mmm . this is the best pineapple upside @-@ down cake you have ever made .
you know why ?
it has an ingredient my cakes have never had before ...
danger .
i know ! sneaking around makes everything taste better .
when i was with john rowland ,
every sense was heightened
it was like this ...
skip it . you wouldn &apos;t understand .
oh , really ? wouldn &apos;t i ?
what ? you ? no way .
just because i don &apos;t trumpet my indiscretions like you do ,
doesn &apos;t mean i haven &apos;t had a little walk on the wild side .
you cheated on rex ?
of course not .
what do you take me for ? i cheated on orson .
with who ?
karl mayer .
oh , my god !
he was a slimeball , but he was hot .
mm . we &apos;d meet at this cheap hotel ,
and as guilty as it made me , i still felt this ... tingle ,
this frisson i &apos;d never felt before .
and now this week with you ... it &apos;s back .
just wish lynette didn &apos;t have to come home tomorrow .
actually , that motel story gives me an idea .
gaby , i &apos;m flattered ,
but i really don &apos;t think we should--
not that .
there &apos;s a great new spa that just opened on foster lake .
we should go next weekend .
do we dare ?
i think we both know the answer to that .
i went by our house today .
it &apos;s looking a little run @-@ down .
yeah ? you want me to talk to paul ?
he &apos;s supposed to be keeping the place up .
uh , actually , i already did . uh ...
he seems kind of run @-@ down , too .
wh @-@ what are you doing talking to paul ?
well , i was picking up m.j. , and he came out of the house ,
and ... kind of worried about him .
why ? who cares ?
mike , he gave me a kidney .
no , beth gave you a kidney .
paul did everything he could to block it .
yeah , but we talked , and after , he seemed so sad .
i don &apos;t give a damn !
i know you feel bad for the guy , but i don &apos;t trust him .
please ... just do me a favor
and stay away from him .
okay .
now can we talk about something a little more fun ?
like our plan for sex night ?
okay , hold that thought . i &apos;m gonna take a shower .
may i come in ?
please .
lynette , what are you doing here ?
i thought you had a spa thing .
oh , please . i can get a face full of steam
standing over a pot of spaghetti any night of the week .
i wanna see chris cavanaugh .
i know , and i asked , and they said no .
the keynote speech isn &apos;t for spouses .
they said they &apos;ve got other activities planned for you .
activities that they plan for me ?
tom , i &apos;m not a child .
i &apos;m a grown @-@ up .
i &apos;ll decide what i want to do .
come on . don &apos;t you know how much i wanna see this guy ?
can &apos;t you pull some strings ?
i don &apos;t have any strings .
when i &apos;ve been five or six times ,
then maybe i can ask for a favor , but not now .
there you are . someone &apos;s been naughty .
let &apos;s go , mrs. scavo .
i think it &apos;s somebody &apos;s spa time .
this is why you keep us drunk , huh ?
so we don &apos;t fight back .
this hits the spot .
i remembered you like your coffee
same way you like your men--
strong and irish .
so how did you get out of jail so soon ?
was it good behavior
or bad behavior with the warden ?
oh , karen .
how i &apos;ve missed your frank and salty questions .
actually , it was , uh ,
what they call humanitarian release .
you see ...
my only daughter passed away just recently .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know you had a daughter .
such a sweet girl .
so young .
she was barely 30 when she died .
i wish i could have met her .
actually , i &apos;m pretty sure you did .
her name was beth . beth young .
can i ... freshen that ?
so we &apos;ll cut you back to ten every day on the prednisone
and take it from there . any questions ?
i do have one .
shoot .
is it common for patients to have sex dreams
about the husbands of their dead donors ?
i have to admit , i did not see that coming .
understand--awake , i have no conscious desire for this man .
but in my dreams ...
susan , i &apos;m not a psychologist .
but you went to med school .
you must have learned something about dreams--
a course , a book .
okay . what did you talk about before you went to sleep ?
i was talking about him .
i mean , he &apos;s not doing very well ,
and i got in an argument with my husband
about whether i should help him .
well , maybe the dream is telling you to follow that impulse .
the man &apos;s wife died . you &apos;re alive because of it .
it &apos;s natural to be concerned about him
and want to make sure he &apos;s okay .
mike really doesn &apos;t want me to talk to him .
it &apos;s your call ,
but my guess is your dreams won &apos;t stop until you do .
when paul went to jail ,
his one goal was to make me
pay for putting him there ,
so he wrote to beth , begging her to come see him .
he said he was innocent , that he was a good man .
paul &apos;s very charming when he wants to be , and beth ...
she fell in love with him ,
just like he knew she would .
well , didn &apos;t you try to warn her ?
of course . she just said i didn &apos;t know him like she did .
when he was released , when he had defiled her ,
the real paul came out .
he said he &apos;d never loved her , that she was stupid
and that she didn &apos;t deserve to live .
s @-@ so she killed herself ...
just like he knew she would .
bastard .
i hope you &apos;ll keep this story between us at least for now .
beth would hate for all her friends
to know what a fool she was .
okay , but the one thing i don &apos;t get
is why do you wanna live on the same street as that monster ?
so i can watch him !
it &apos;s too late for beth and my sister ,
but i won &apos;t let him destroy another woman
the way he destroyed them .
well , you &apos;re not watching him alone ,
because i &apos;ll keep my eye on that s.o.b. , too .
now if you need anything-- anything at all--
you give me a call .
oh , karen .
i &apos;m so lucky to have a friend like you .
wonderful what a 4 @-@ handed massage can do .
one more hand , and it would &apos;ve been perfect ,
but this ain &apos;t that kind of spa .
no , no , tell him he has a choice .
he can sign those papers
before i shove them down his throat
or after they come out the other end .
yes .
i guess someone didn &apos;t see the &quot; no cell phones &quot; sign .
i guess that rule only applies to plus ones .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
i wanna grab a soak before the keynote speech . bye .
oh , ms. butler ?
huh ? oh , hi .
yes , i &apos;m her . she &apos;s me .
meg butler . meg .
oh , we have a seat for you up front .
uh ... great .
welcome , ladies and gentlemen .
now to introduce our keynote speaker--
the president of amtech , ms. meg butler .
come up .
come on .
hi .
those of you who know meg know ... i &apos;m not meg .
nutmeg . that &apos;s funny .
uh , anyway ...
meg asked me to introduce chris cavanaugh
because she knows what a huge , huge fan i am .
where are ya , ya big @-@ brained rascal ?
oh , there he is .
almost as hot as his author photo .
anyway ...
those of you who haven &apos;t read &quot; flashpoint , &quot; do it immediately .
put it in your kindle , your ipad .
i don &apos;t know . buy the book . it will make you smarter ,
because what chris cavanaugh has to say about human nature ,
about creativity ,
is absolutely-- there she is !
that &apos;s the bitch who stole my lanyard and my clothes !
ladies and gentlemen , chris cavanaugh .
hi . i called you a bunch of times .
your phone must beroken .
it is now . please respect my privacy .
paul , you have to let me talk to you .
why ?
because you &apos;re a mess , and someone has to do something .
and okay , i &apos;m having dreams about us .
dreams ? what kind of dreams ?
regular dreams--
lots of daylight , lots of clothes .
look , i &apos;m your landlord . i have a right to come in .
but i &apos;d like you to invite me in .
getting ready to cook something ?
i see onions , potatoes ,
this long green and white thing
with scary little hairs on the bottom .
this is food , right ?
it &apos;s called a leek .
i was trying to make potato leek soup .
i love potato leek soup .
of course , that was before i knew what a leek was .
you want some help ?
come on . soup i can do .
making soup ? is that what we were doing in your dream ?
no . no , we weren &apos;t .
that reminds me . i need to wash my hands .
hey . how was the big conference ?
okay .
you meet any guys for me ? i &apos;m not picky .
you know what they say .
ugly plus money equals handsome .
well , apparently ,
crazy plus wife equals laughingstock .
uh , you two having a fight ?
yeah , kinda .
well , you won &apos;t even know i &apos;m here .
tom , why don &apos;t we finish this later ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
do you not wanna be embarrassed in front of your friend ?
well , she just embarrassed me in front of the whole fortune 500 .
i don &apos;t know how many different ways i can apologize .
at some point , you &apos;re gonna have to let it go .
i kinda don &apos;t feel like letting it go , lynette .
it &apos;s not just the fact that you humiliated me .
it &apos;s that after all those years that i supported you ,
took a backseat to your career , you couldn &apos;t do the same for me .
what happened ?
it was awful .
all weekend , i was treated like a plus one ,
a second class citizen , a--
a wife !
lynette , in tom &apos;s world , that &apos;s what you are .
you &apos;re gonna have to get used to it .
what if i don &apos;t wanna get used to it ?
well , take it from someone who spent eight years
being &quot; mrs. third baseman , &quot;
you can be a wife ...
or you can be a first wife .
i &apos;m home .
hi , honey . how was your day ?
worked straight through lunch and i &apos;m starving .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a pineapple upside @-@ down cake .
reminds me of the cake your old friend bree
brought to dinner last month .
huh . i @-@ i don &apos;t remember that .
&apos;cause obviously bree didn &apos;t make this one ,
since i don &apos;t e her anymore
because i know ... how you feel about her .
so ... where &apos;d this come from ?
i ... m @-@ made it .
really ?
the woman who ordered in chinese food
for christmas dinner made a pineapple upside @-@ down cake .
well , it &apos;s not that hard .
it &apos;s just some pineapples and ... upside @-@ down cake .
you know what ?
this looks ... so good .
i would love for you to make me one ...
just like it .
right now ?
yeah , and i &apos;m gonna sit here and watch you ...
every step of the way .
sure . no problem .
first , i &apos;m gonna get some flour ,
&apos;cause you can &apos;t make a cake without flour , right ?
oh , no ! got it all over me .
maybe i should take my top off .
in fact ...
why don &apos;t you and i go up to the bedroom and--
make the cake .
well , you really are hungry .
well , let me freshen up first .
he wants you to make a pineapple upside @-@ down cake--
the woman who ordered in chinese for christmas ?
yes , we &apos;ve already covered that . now what am i gonna do ?
if i can &apos;t make this ,
he &apos;s gonna know i &apos;ve been seeing you .
just stall him . i &apos;ll make one and slip it to you .
no , he wants to watch me make it .
okay , don &apos;t panic . we can do this .
how ?
okay !
one pineapple upside @-@ down cake coming right up .
first , preheat your oven to 300 .
first , i &apos;m gonna preheat my oven to 300 .
then we &apos;re gonna start with the caramel topping .
and then we &apos;re gonna start with the caramel topping ...
for which i will need ...
sugar .
brown sugar .
and butter . how much butter ?
who are you talking to ?
uh ... my ... grandmother .
see , this was her recipe , and talking to her
makes me feel like we &apos;re making it togeter .
how much butter , grandma ?
quarter cup . got it .
and ?
it &apos;s very good .
it is ? hot damn .
you know , truthfully , i was just kinda winging it .
oh , and if you don &apos;t taste the wine ,
it &apos;s &apos; cause i drank it .
so last time you and i had a meal together ,
had to be ... before mary alice died .
that was a long time ago .
maybe we should start doing that again .
susan ...
why are you doing this ?
why do you care ?
m.j. ! no running .
ah , leave him alone .
it &apos;s nice to see something moving fast in here .
thanks . and just to warn you ,
we ... might be a little late picking him up .
yeah ? looks like
you &apos;re going to be a little late getting started .
i remember a guy that used to live on this street .
he taught my daughter to swim .
he made a killer barbecue tri @-@ tip .
he had a laugh you could hear three houses away .
i liked that guy .
i &apos;m not that man anymore .
i think you can be .
oh , you know , i &apos;ll be right back .
what the hell are you doing ? i asked you not to come here .
i know , but paul is suffering ,
and everyone else has turned their back on him .
you know why ? &apos; cause he &apos;s a bad guy !
look , you might have fallen for his act ,
but i haven &apos;t , and i &apos;m not gonna let you put yourself in danger .
get in the car . we &apos;re going .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
mike , i--believe it or not , i am not an idiot .
i don &apos;t need to be rescued from whaver trouble it is
you think i &apos;m getting myself into .
you don &apos;t know this guy like i do .
i know the look in somebody &apos;s eyes when they &apos;re hurting ,
and i &apos;m not leaving until i know that paul &apos;s okay .
so you &apos;re going back in there .
yeah .
support me or not . that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
i heard an oven timer go off . let &apos;s take a look .
no ! aah ! not yet !
secret &apos;s all in the cooling ,
and in fact , it &apos;ll probably cool faster on the windowsill .
hi . we &apos;re collecting for juvenile--
out of my way ! hot cake !
okay , but while we are waiting ,
there &apos;s just one thing i have to say .
hey . this is not about a cake . this is about trust .
it is a sad day
when a husband forces a wife to bake for him
just to prove she &apos;s not a liar .
do you have any idea how offensive that is ?
cake &apos;s ready .
ahh . there .
one perfect pineapple upside down cake .
if only trust were so easy to make .
you look surprised .
i am .
after the way i talked to you ,
i was kind of expecting the firing squad .
i thought about it .
but i decided to go for the romantic dinner .
figured , less cleanup .
honey , i ... i understand how you feel about paul .
i know you &apos;re just trying to protect me .
and you &apos;re just being you--
the woman that makes me
pull over to the side of the road in a rainstorm
to pick up a sick raccoon .
in my defense , i did think it was a cat .
the point is ...
i can &apos;t stay mad at you
for being the kind , compassionate woman you are .
especially since it &apos;s been six weeks since we &apos;ve had sex .
that , too .
you sure you &apos;re okay watching the girls all weekend ?
hey , you can &apos;t miss your old modeling friend &apos;s funeral .
yeah . we were really close .
well , you get to see some old friends ,
maybe even reconnect with a few .
maybe .
look , i know it &apos;s been hard for you to not see bree ,
but it has meant a lot to me .
nice coat . is it new ?
yeah . i just bought it this week .
so then this long red hair must have got on it pretty recently .
it &apos;s not what you think .
i ... took juanita to a kid &apos;s birthday party ,
and i hugged a clown .
you hugged a clown ?
his monkey died . he was very emotional .
so you &apos;re off to a funeral , huh ?
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t--don &apos;t open that ! i packed it very carefully !
i can see that .
one , two , three bikinis .
is your friend being buried at sea ?
stop it . i &apos;m gonna be late .
late for what ? weekend getaway with bree ?
damn it , gaby . i forbade you to see her .
well , that was your first mistake . what did you expect ?
i expected you to choose me !
you know , ever since we moved to this street ,
and--and you got so tight with those women ,
i always feel like you put them first .
you know that &apos;s not true .
prove it .
choose .
who do you want in your life--me or bree ?
don &apos;t do this .
i am doing it , gaby .
choose .
yes , the residents of wisteria lane
are nothing if not loyal .
but there are times when that loyalty
is put to the test ...
by the desire to help a stricken friend ...
by the need to protect a long @-@ buried secret .
by the movement of two lives in opposite directions .
and sometimes just as one test of loyalty ends ...
another begins .
gaby , i thought we said we &apos;d meet at the spa .
little change of plans .
carlos knows .
about us ?
yeah . can i stay with you for a while ?
of course .
thank you .
