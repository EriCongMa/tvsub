第六季 第十八集
happy . that &apos;s the word .
happy that you won the election ?
yes . and very grateful
to all those who shared my vision .
it &apos;s really ... a shared victory .
a victory that becomes less improbable
when you see alicia florrick in action .
what do i love the most about coming to my law firm ?
well , that &apos;s easy . the camaraderie .
if alicia florrick &apos;s a legal powerhouse ,
it &apos;s because she commands the respect of her colleagues .
but it wasn &apos;t always so .
st. alicia came by way of an arduous journey .
can we do better than that one ?
yeah , tell me when .
there . no , back one .
move in on it slowly .
st. alicia came by way of an arduous journey .
one that took her from stay @-@ at @-@ home mom to scandal
to lowly associate .
the scandal photo-- can we keep her in color
and make everything else black and white ?
yeah , great . now back to the interview .
... to lowly associate
to founding partner of one of chicago &apos;s largest firms .
how will my administration differ
from that of my husband &apos;s ?
well , it &apos;s not ... i can &apos;t , um ...
no , cut the stumble .
i ...
... chicago &apos;s largest firms .
the better question ?
how will my administration be different from my predecessor ?
we will be accountable to victims ,
worthy of the public &apos;s trust .
i &apos;m sorry , petra . i need to get mrs. florrick on the phone
with the governor just for a moment .
sure , eli . anything for you .
going great , though . love what you &apos;re doing .
aw , thanks .
there &apos;s no one on the phone .
just turn around and pretend you &apos;re having a conversation .
it &apos;s about the hack .
are you sure the e @-@ mails are safe ?
we &apos;re hearing that they might still come out .
hearing from whom ?
i heard diane and cary talking .
you want some crackers ?
no .
the hackers want an apology from the firm .
well , we already resolved it .
i mean , we can &apos;t publicly condone piracy .
you don &apos;t have to .
we regret any implication
that the blah @-@ blah @-@ blah shareware is not legitimate.you know .
i have to consult my partners .
well , the deadline &apos;s at the end of the week ,
or the e @-@ mails go wide , so consult fast .
thank you .
set ?
yes , yes . sorry about that .
no , no , no .
all set .
i was thinking of using this stuff for the sit @-@ down .
it looks way better than the first time she sat down .
i didn &apos;t ...
i didn &apos;t shake her hand that time .
... and we will be transparent .
accountable to victims , worthy of the public &apos;s trust .
where &apos;d you get these ?
an anonymous source .
they &apos;re hacked ?
yes . alicia florrick &apos;s hacked e @-@ mails
from the past five years .
you have to read them .
thought this was a puff piece .
it was .
people don &apos;t like when you tear down their heroes .
are you kidding ?
that &apos;s what they live for .
i need independent corroboration .
talk to her firm , confirm they &apos;ve been hacked .
yes , we did have an attack
on our e @-@ mail services , but we have since ...
petra moritz .
but we have since repelled that attack .
no , it &apos;s had absolutely no impact ...
okay , daddy just needs a minute ,
so i need you guys to sit quietly .
come on . charlie , come on .
ms. sharma , hello . good to see you again .
you , too , mr. wiley . what are you up to today ?
oh , just , you know , the usual-- making trouble .
see you later .
bye .
yes , well , he &apos;s in with a client right now .
sure , i &apos;d be happy to send you to voice mail if that &apos;s okay .
uh , that &apos;s no problem at all .
thank you very much .
that &apos;ll be 10 : 00 tomorrow ?
hey , uh , everything all right ?
yes , i just have to meet this mr. dipple at his think tank .
no , i mean in there .
oh , yes . andrew wiley . you know , the investigator ?
yeah . what &apos;s he asking ?
he &apos;s working with internal affairs .
looking into detective prima and how he set up cary .
brady violation .
yeah , and how he entrapped cary , too .
well , they &apos;re finding that harder to prove .
why is he talking to us ?
they want to find out
how we discovered that e @-@ mail from canada .
the one that prima deleted .
they want to prosecute him for this .
see you .
hi .
hey .
can i help you ?
yeah , uh , i need some legal advice .
okay .
hypothetically , a cop is going to prison for something that he didn &apos;t do .
someone else did it .
but there &apos;s a lawyer who made misrepresentations
based on ... on , um ...
i , um ...
just don &apos;t use names , and i &apos;m fine .
look ... someone is guilty of faking evidence ,
but a lawyer who did not fake that evidence ,
and , in fact , thought it to be true ,
presented it in court .
now , is that lawyer in trouble ?
what , for using the faked evidence ?
yeah . even though she didn &apos;t know that it was faked ?
mm @-@ hmm , yes .
ignorance is irrelevant .
the lawyer could be disbarred or even go to prison .
okay , and , uh ,
what if that person who faked the evidence
swore to the lawyer &apos;s innocence ?
doesn &apos;t matter . it &apos;s strict liability .
okay .
anything else ?
no .
uh , that &apos;s enough . thank you .
sure .
diane , you brave soul , welcome to the plenary institute .
how am i brave ?
liberal lawyer in this lion &apos;s den of conservatism ?
a lion &apos;s den is perfectly safe
when you have god on your side .
ah , there she is , quoting the bible .
diane , may i introduce max gauls , cole @-@ harberts @-@ greyson ?
nice to meet you .
justin partridge of simkins @-@ wilde .
it &apos;s so good to meet you .
diane , have a seat right over here .
okay .
so , what am i doing ?
aside from picking up your retainer check ?
i need a liberal viewpoint .
on ?
gay marriage .
you &apos;re the devil &apos;s advocate .
in what way ?
we &apos;re trying to decide
whether to fund a case on gay marriage and religious accommodation .
and what is the case ?
in may of 2014 , jane armisen ,
a baker in california ,
was asked to bake a cake for a gay wedding .
she refused , citing religious objections to supporting gay marriage ,
and was sued for discrimination .
she lost .
and you &apos;re wondering whether
to take up this baker &apos;s appeal ?
yup .
no.obviously.
well , that &apos;s not surprising .
well , it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a liberal .
it &apos;s because ... you won &apos;t win .
i mean , this was a plain wedding cake ?
there was nothing about the cake itself
that was offensive to the baker ?
that &apos;s correct . it &apos;s the fact it would have been used
in a ceremony she believes dishonored her religious creed .
but this baker advertises to the public
that she makes these wedding cakes ,
and she will sell these wedding cakes to anyone ,
just not gay people .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but that &apos;s not a strong case .
well , the constitution guarantees her the free exercise of religion .
and california &apos;s civil rights act forbids discrimination
against lgbt people .
so , we have two competing freedoms .
businesses are allowed to refuse service to anyone .
with certain exceptions to that right .
it cannot be based on race ,
color , religion or sexual orientation .
in some states , sexual orientation .
in many states .
well , but there are exceptions to the exceptions .
what did thomas jefferson say ?
among the most inestimable of our blessings
is that of liberty to worship our creator
in a way we think would be agreeable to him ?
it &apos;s no different from conscientious objectors to war .
i &apos;m sorry to be blunt .
i know you come to your opinions honestly .
well , it &apos;s not just my opinion .
the religious freedom restoration act allows
exemptions in anti @-@ discrimination laws .
not in california . california does not have one .
well , let &apos;s say we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re not in california .
let &apos;s say we &apos;re in colorado .
okay , well , we &apos;re not in colorado ,
but rfra would not be your friend there , either .
so , let &apos;s say it &apos;s in new mexico .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the baker &apos;s refusing to sell a wedding cake
to a gay couple for who they are .
that is the heart of discrimination .
what if our baker won &apos;t sell a wedding cake to a gay couple ,
but he will sell them bear claws ?
cupcakes ?
that &apos;s right .
she isn &apos;t , in fact , refusing to serve homosexuals .
she just won &apos;t do the one thing
her religion says is a sin .
okay .
that &apos;s a good point .
great . let &apos;s take a little break .
so , um , where is diane lockhart ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
that &apos;s a good point ?
it was a good point .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
you know it wasn &apos;t .
well , you wanted me to help .
no , i want you to fight .
i want you to convince me this is a loser case .
if you &apos;re worried about offending me , don &apos;t .
i have a gay nephew , okay ?
love my gay nephew , want him to be happy .
i just don &apos;t happen to believe in gay marriage . you do .
convince me i &apos;m wrong .
go for the jugular ?
mm @-@ hmm , right there , ma &apos;am . right there .
that &apos;s insane . selling someone something they don &apos;t want is
the same thing as refusing them service altogether .
no , it isn &apos;t .
a vegetarian couple walks into a market ,
you can &apos;t even compare ...
and you refuse to sell them vegetables .
in fact , you &apos;ll sell them anything but vegetables .
you are effectively denying them service .
a gay couple wants to buy a wedding cake ,
and you refuse to sell them a wedding cake .
the camaraderie , the relationships i &apos;ve built here--
it &apos;s what makes coming to work a joy .
relationships that have been built
with some difficulty ... apparently .
now cut to the e @-@ mail .
float it in , star wars style .
alicia florrick to a coworker :
it &apos;s all about money to them .
the partners don &apos;t give a damn about us ?
float in the second e @-@ mail .
the partners don &apos;t give a damn about us .
two of her coworkers write :
alicia is a perfect example
of someone sleeping her way to the top ?
now change the music .
it &apos;s all about money to them .
the partners don &apos;t give damn about us .
two of her coworkers write ,
alicia is a perfect example
of someone sleeping her way to the top .

第六季 第18集
mrs. florrick , i want to thank you
for agreeing to sit down for a second interview .
absolutely .
we just need clarification on a few things .
mrs. florrick , you returned
to the practice of law after 12 years ...
thirteen .
13 years . sorry .
and you walk into this law firm ,
full of old bulls and young tigers .
were you nervous ?
very .
and the only person you knew at all was will gardner .
yes .
the two of you
wound up becoming quite close , didn &apos;t you ?
will was a terrific lawyer .
he was smart , creative .
zealous in the best sense of the word .
maybe more importantly ,
a ... a trusted friend ?
yes .
and after may 2010 , perhaps even more so ?
apologies . i just need to borrow alicia for a moment .
i forgot to get an answer on something time @-@ sensitive .
she has the e @-@ mails .
or the photos .
no , she said may 2010 .
that &apos;s the e @-@ mails .
what e @-@ mails ? what are we talking about ? how bad ?
give her your phone . i &apos;m calling this off .
you &apos;re saying that a hindu or a muslim
can enter a bake shop ...
no , that isn &apos;t comparable .
yes , it is .
they &apos;re both protected classes .
a hindu can enter a bake shop
and be denied a wedding cake .
no , no , because that is denial of a class of people .
exactly . like gays .
no , that is the denial of an activity .
of the marriage .
which is just a pretext for discrimination .
what if it weren &apos;t a blank wedding cake ?
yes , but that &apos;s not what happened .
i know that .
i &apos;m trying to determine where religious freedom ends
and antidiscrimination laws begin .
what if jane were asked to attach a figurine
of two men holding hands ?
could she deny that service ?
if she &apos;s offering the service of supplying figurines ,
then , no , she cannot deny that service .
well , what if she &apos;s asked to write on the cake
&quot; congratulations , roger and carl &quot; ?
can she deny that because it &apos;s speech she doesn &apos;t approve of ?
well , now we come around to the free speech argument .
well , you knew we were gonna end up there .
okay , well , here &apos;s the thing ,
it &apos;s not her speech .
it &apos;s the speech of the person purchasing the service .
i mean , imagine if she is a printer
and a gay person comes in needing flyers .
she cannot reject his business ,
even though the flyer may be advertising an lgbt meeting ,
because to reject him is to discriminate
based on sexual preference .
just as one can &apos;t discriminate based on religion ?
exactly .
so if a christian walks into the cake shop
and orders a cake that says
god sends all gays to hell .
does the baker have to write that on the wedding cake
even if she doesn &apos;t approve of it ?
no .
because you find it offensive ?
no . because the baker is not objecting to a religion
but a point of view .
a hateful one at that .
but the purchaser finds it essential to his or her faith .
i mean , isn &apos;t the christian a protected class ,
with the same protection as gays ?
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s been a , uh ,
slight hiccup in the investigation .
what hiccup ?
detective prima deleted the e @-@ mail
from the canadian authorities at 3 : 11 p.m.
on august 28 .
that &apos;s the great thing about technology .
you &apos;re never wondering ,
you know , when this or that happened .
it &apos;s all right there in black and white .
so , good . so , what &apos;s the problem ?
timmy , dora , less noise . uh , okay , here .
uh , detective prima was on the stand
testifying in a burglary case
38 p.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. on august 28,
so , i mean , unless there &apos;s a mistake in the public record
or in the e @-@ mail metadata ,
there is no possible way ...
hey , dora , let go of timmy &apos;s hair .
there is no possible way
that prima could have deleted the e @-@ mail .
okay , so what &apos;s your theory ?
well , unfortunately ,
my theory involves asa geneva pine ,
who was having an affair with prima at the time .
you &apos;re kidding .
no . i mean , you know , she didn &apos;t tell anybody .
you know . i mean , for ...
uh ... sorry .
can you ... for obvious reasons . kids , cheerios .
you think she deleted the e @-@ mail for prima ?
well , she was the only one in the department
with access to his account .
i was wondering , uh , if you guys had any other thoughts .
uh ... why would we have thoughts ?
i have no idea .
do you ?
no .
don &apos;t make me count to five .
will was a terrific lawyer .
he was smart , creative .
zealous in the best sense of the word .
june 2010 .
&quot; will , sometimes i worry this is wrong ,
you being my boss . &quot;
will to alicia ,
&quot; i know , but i cant get you out of my head .
the touch of you . the taste . &quot;
that &apos;s a long time to be on one image .
right . cut to the scandal .
make her black and white , everything else in color .
alicia to will :
&quot; you were away at depos this week
all i could think about is your hands on me . &quot;
sometimes this feels too dangerous .
editing .
you &apos;d better get out there .
she is planning to use illegally obtained e @-@ mails .
not just use-- broadcast .
which is so far beyond the pale ,
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re having this conversation .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t hack her e @-@ mails--
i just received copies of them .
a distinction without a difference .
well , no .
the supreme court has spoken to this .
bartnicki v. vopper .
as long as we didn &apos;t steal the material ,
we have a first amendment right to publish it .
if it &apos;s a matter of public concern .
mrs. florrick is a public official now .
but that does not strip her of her right to privacy .
exactly .
you use these private e @-@ mails , sir , you and petra ,
you are , you know , uh , blah @-@ blah .
coconspirators .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re wrong on the law .
you can go after the hackers here but not us .
there is a tort for the disclosure of private facts .
well , then sue us after it airs .
oh , come on , charles .
you made a speech to the international press commission
about the ethics of journalism .
and now you &apos;re looking for cover to air this kind of , you know ...
scurrilous , sexually charged innuendo , which , until today ,
was the stuff of tabloids and blogs .
which , it should be noted , is where you came from .
your righteous indignation is sweet , eli ,
but you started this .
you created the myth of st. alicia .
that is absolutely not true .
you love to build people up
that is bs .
and then tear them down .
the truth , which comes out in these e @-@ mails--
it puts the lie to all that . and the public has a right to know .
you &apos;ve really lost all perspective in this ,
petra .
no , you really ... it &apos;s gross .
you &apos;re gross .
thank you .
i &apos;m gonna hold this piece until ...
ch @-@ charles .
... u @-@ until i can consider all sides .
ethically and otherwise .
what are you gonna do ?
who would be interested in this ?
tmz or gawker ?
i don &apos;t know . both .
what about a , uh , say , a wedding planner ?
it &apos;s first amendment , it &apos;s personal services ,
it @-@ it &apos;s religious freedom all rolled into one . isn &apos;t it ?
yes , you would arguably have a better case
with a wedding planner because of the burden on her--
her time commitment , her level of creativity ,
the list of her personal contacts .
yes , that @-@ that would be a harder case for me to win .
great .
well , that was exhausting .
but effective .
i have decided not to fund the baker &apos;s appeal .
good .
i think that &apos;s smart .
not just ideologically but practically .
i think you &apos;d lose .
do you know what metadata is ?
i do .
did you know it &apos;s possible to fake metadata ?
i didn &apos;t .
yeah , i @-@ it &apos;s very difficult .
y @-@ you have to first hack into the computer ,
then change the code ...
i &apos;m really not sure
what it is that you need from me , mr. wiley .
you used to work in the s.a. &apos; s office .
i &apos;m just wondering if you have any information
that might be helpful to me or
if you know of anyone here who might have faked the metadata .
no .
sorry .
eli couldn &apos;t make it .
some blah @-@ blah with the governor .
good.i don &apos;t have the energy to talk to eli .
what am i doing here ?
i wanted to give you a heads @-@ up .
you &apos;re kidding me .
i got no choice . gawker &apos;s starting to sniff around .
it &apos;s just a matter of time before they dump everything online .
don &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t afford to get scooped .
but you can afford to be a tool .
that &apos;s good to know
the next time i need a , you know ... a tool .
hi . alicia .
bit of a problem .
from npr news in washington ,
i &apos;m lakshmi singh .
another salvo in the ongoing cultural dispute
over same @-@ sex marriage in america ,
this time involving a gay couple in idaho
who were turned down by a wedding planner .
same @-@ sex marriage is legal in idaho ,
and the couple sued and won .
but now prominent conservative activist reese dipple
has agreed to fund the wedding planner &apos;s appeal .
do you have a dollar ?
uh ... yeah .
why ?
&apos;cause i need it .
here you go .
okay . so i &apos;m your lawyer now , kalinda ,
and this dollar represents attorney @-@ client privilege .
sure .
you faked metadata , and diane presented it in court
to get cary released , yes ?
yeah .
but diane didn &apos;t know it was faked .
yeah .
anything else ?
look ,
after i faked the data , i had second thoughts about using it .
but diane took it from my computer without my knowledge .
i didn &apos;t realize until i got to court
and saw her present it to the judge .
okay .
okay . you don &apos;t talk to anyone about this .
not diane . not cary .
and not wiley .
you just talk to me . okay ?
do you have any ideas ?
no .
you used me .
what ?
that wasn &apos;t a think tank exercise .
you were trying to find a wedge issue against gay marriage .
of course i was . and i found it .
and you helped me .
great .
so i was your liberal guinea pig .
why is that a bad thing ?
if you think that gay marriage
can withstand all legal assaults ,
you should rejoice in any chance to defend it .
so you &apos;re funding this wedding planner &apos;s appeal now ?
yeah , i am . it &apos;s a stronger case .
and you can help me .
i won &apos;t defend her .
you don &apos;t have to .
i wouldn &apos;t ask you to be someone you &apos;re not .
i want you to represent the plaintiff .
excuse me ?
we &apos;re having a mock trial here this afternoon
with the real wedding planner .
i want you to sue her . destroy her .
see what damage you can do .
so you can improve your case ?
yeah .
but also so you can destroy it .
who &apos;s my client ?
couldn &apos;t find the real plaintiff .
you &apos;ll have to work with a stand @-@ in .
who &apos;s the judge ?
geoffrey solomon . so nice to meet you .
such an honor , sir . diane lockhart .
i know .
i think i read your harvard book three times .
really ? that &apos;s more than all my ex @-@ wives put together .
r.d.
you got to admit , i &apos;m stacking the deck against myself here .
liberal judge , tough plaintiff &apos;s attorney .
you lose , all your fault .
thanks .
okay , strategy session .
two @-@ pronged attack .
oh , i love the two prongs .
even as a kid ,
we had two @-@ pronged attacks .
marissa . shh .
we have to delay petra ,
even it &apos;s only by 24 hours .
how do we do that ?
hello , eli . what do you need ?
i just got off the phone with the governor .
he thinks he can help you fill out your story .
really ? in what way ?
by offering you an on @-@ screen interview .
you know , this is such bs .
what ?
you &apos;re just trying to delay me .
hey , if you don &apos;t want the interview , that &apos;s fine .
when can he do it ?
there &apos;s a chance later tonight .
what kind of chance ?
mm , 60 / 40 .
no restrictions on questions ?
none .
okay .
get back to me with the time .
sure will .
so you don &apos;t get back to her ?
oh , you do . 11 : 30 tonight .
now prong two .
we pre @-@ spin the e @-@ mails .
what does that mean ?
we go to a friendly reporter .
and reporters who hate petra .
we give them the chance to scoop her .
if you don &apos;t want a story to be told ,
it &apos;s better to tell it yourself .
well , how do we tell it ourselves ?
what &apos;s the worst revelation and the worst e @-@ mail ?
alicia , i can &apos;t get you out of my head .
the touch of you , the taste ...
okay . thanks .
it &apos;s just flirtation .
there was no affair , these are flirtatious e @-@ mails .
eli .
what ?
i think you and i should talk a little . alicia ,
i know this is embarrassing for you ,
but we don &apos;t need to explain your life .
all we need to explain are these e @-@ mails ,
and these e @-@ mails merely suggest an obsession ... a flirtation .
that &apos;s gonna be embarrassing enough .
are there any e @-@ mails that suggest an actual affair ?
will , you were away to depos this week .
all i could think about was your hands on me .
sometimes this feels too dangerous .
okay , still pretty embarrassing ,
but merely suggestive of an act-- you didn &apos;t act on it .
this is just sexting . and this was all happening
while your husband was screwing around .
yeah , i don &apos;t think we need to go too deep into that .
why not ? she &apos;s right .
alicia was merely tempted because her husband moved out on her ,
and , uh , blah @-@ blah .
okay , i don &apos;t think we need to tear down peter
to build up alicia .
it was an affair .
i can &apos;t just say this stuff about will ,
because it wasn &apos;t true .
but no one would appreciate it more
if you did than will .
he always knew what had to be said .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
now what ?
get peter to talk to her .
i &apos;m not prejudiced against gay people .
i @-@ i &apos;m not prejudiced against anyone .
but i believe the bible is the word of god . period .
and it &apos;s not mine to ...
ignore or change as i wish .
well , honestly , it would be easier to do that .
i don &apos;t want to be
in the position of turning down business .
i &apos;m a wedding planner . i need your business ,
sir-- i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m supposed to ...
treat him like the actual guy who &apos;s suing me , right ?
that &apos;s right , ms. dahl .
treat this just like court .
treat me just like a judge .
look , i certainly don &apos;t want to be sued
for sticking to my beliefs ,
but they are what they are .
thank you , ms. dahl .
your witness .
so , ms. dahl , uh ,
you &apos;ve been a wedding planner for 12 years ,
is that correct ?
yes .
and in all that time , you have never been approached
about doing a gay wedding before ?
never . of course ,
there &apos;s a homosexual community in pocatello ,
and my very favorite florist is gay .
but you are aware that gay marriage
has been legal in idaho since october of 2014 .
i &apos;m aware it &apos;s legal , yes .
abortion is legal , too .
it doesn &apos;t mean i have to agree with it .
but you have to follow the law .
i @-@ i &apos;m not stopping anyone from getting married .
i just don &apos;t want to be the one to plan their wedding .
that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m helping two people
seal their commitment to one another before the world
and before god .
i can &apos;t do that if i don &apos;t believe in it .
ms. dahl ...
how many times did , um , jesus
condemn homosexuality ?
objection . relevance .
she &apos;s claiming religion is the basis of her refusal , counselor .
i fail to see how the specifics of that religion
could not be relevant .
um , jesus
never condemned
homosexuality .
and how many times
did jesus condemn divorce ? three times .
four times ...
if you count matthew and mark &apos;s account
of the same incident .
thank you .
uh , so you &apos;ve never planned a wedding ...
for a couple that had previously been married ?
um ... i haven &apos;t asked .
i ... i guess i have .
well , in fact ,
you have planned ...
two weddings in the last year alone
where one or both of the couple
had previously been married .
that sounds right .
so your religious objection is selective , at best .
wouldn &apos;t you say ?
objection . argumentative .
sustained .
no more questions .
let &apos;s talk .
you have no choice .
i &apos;m not gonna lie ,
especially not for a reporter .
you have to control the narrative .
to keep me from looking like the slutty wife .
yeah .
it &apos;ll kill you .
and you .
you &apos;ll be the cuckold .
if you don &apos;t control the narrative .
it &apos;s kind of odd that we &apos;re discussing this so calmly .
i &apos;m hoping it &apos;s maturity .
really ? is that what it looks like ?
talking calmly .
not yelling .
making sense . yeah .
have we come through the other side ?
what other side ?
of anger .
jealousy . disgust .
did i disgust you ?
for a while .
actually , it &apos;s kind of nice sitting here , drinking together .
it &apos;s like watching two other people drink .
and what do those two other people do ?
they used to be married .
they like each other .
they forgot that they &apos;re supposed to hate each other .
oh , it &apos;s not gonna happen .
what ?
sex .
i didn &apos;t say a word .
you don &apos;t have to .
i can see the look on your face .
i &apos;ve known you a long time .
a long ... long time .
oh , my god !
you &apos;re like an 18 @-@ year @-@ old .
everything &apos;s about where you can stick it .
no .
listen ...
i know you think i &apos;ve been a dog , alicia ,
and i know you think i &apos;ve been a bad husband , but ...
i &apos;ve never been as bad as you &apos;ve wanted me to be .
that &apos;s probably true .
and i loved you .
i still love you .
i don &apos;t know , peter .
love is a word that is so exhausted .
i wish it meant something to me .
can i just leave it tonight
that i like sitting , drinking with you here ?
sure .
mr. andersen , may i call you nils ?
you &apos;re my client &apos;s husband , is that correct ?
for the purposes of these proceedings , yes , i am .
we understand you &apos;re playing a part here ,
mr. , uh ...
my real name &apos;s todd .
fine . just answer ms. lockhart &apos;s questions
as though you were actually nils andersen .
go ahead .
so you &apos;re mr. taylor &apos;s husband ?
i am . we were married in january .
mm . i &apos;d like you to talk about the day
you were turned away by ms. dahl ...
for being gay .
objection .
misstates facts . ms. dahl didn &apos;t
turn them away for being gay .
she simply did not want to participate in their wedding .
sustained . but barely .
mr. andersen , please tell us
how it felt to be turned away .
it felt like crap ,
frankly .
and was this the first time
you &apos;d been turned away from a business
because of someone &apos;s religious objections ?
no . happens a lot .
and so then why sue ms. dahl
and not anyone else ?
i guess it was the straw that broke the camel &apos;s back .
sometimes that &apos;s the way it feels , you know ?
you feel like a second @-@ class citizen ,
and especially in a town like pocatello ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s so small .
in a town that small ,
was it easy to find another wedding planner ?
no . there are only three .
maybe @-@ maybe five or six ,
if you count nearby towns .
they were all booked .
and if ms. dahl
had simply told you she was booked ?
i would have understood .
i guess that would have been a lie ,
but it would have hurt less .
it would have been better than the truth .
do you feel that you have suffered economic harm
due to ms. dahl &apos;s turning you away ?
yes . we had to go all the way to boise
to find a wedding planner .
that &apos;s 200 miles .
we had to make that drive four times .
your honor ?
could i request a ...
a brief recess before we cross ?
well , of course .
how dare you ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
you cast my nephew
as the lover ?
yes , i did .
you said go for the jugular .
hey , uncle reese .
hi , buddy .
will you follow me , please ?
how did you know how to change the metadata ?
i had a friend show me .
but you did it alone ?
yeah , but he knew i was doing it .
and nobody else knew anything about it ?
just him .
do i need to contain this ?
that &apos;s an understatement .
where are you off to ?
uh , have you seen howell ? i thought he was still here .
who ?
howell-- the guy who works on the computer .
oh , yeah . wiley pulled him out for something .
they &apos;re in the conference room together .
did you not believe me when i told you i loved my nephew ?
no , i did . that &apos;s why i approached him .
i &apos;m not paying you to stage a family therapy session .
i &apos;m not paying you to use my relative .
i didn &apos;t use him-- he wanted to participate .
i &apos;m paying you
to act professionally ...
you told me to go for the jugular .
you told me to get personal .
this is more than personal ;
this is an insult , diane .
i &apos;m sorry , sir ,
but if you want to decide on gay marriage ,
you have to see who you &apos;re impacting ,
and it can &apos;t be an actor .
so finish what you started .
may . may , there we go .
very friendly reporter ,
dumb as an ox .
just keep your answers to single syllables
and you should be fine .
mrs. florrick , hello .
mr. willoughby ,
i was thrilled when josh told me you said yes .
i was , too . i voted for you , ma &apos;am .
unless i shouldn &apos;t say that .
oh , well , i won &apos;t tell anyone .
good . i like secrets
and things of that elk .
ilk ?
no , elk .
things of that elk .
shall we get started ?
were alicia and mr. gardner close ? absolutely .
interesting that you &apos;re calling her alicia
and him mr. gardner .
are you trying to manufacture some distance
between them , eli ?
no , kim ,
i &apos;m trying to give you a sense of the reality .
so you did have a relationship with mr. gardner ?
well , it depends on how you define relationship ?
as in relating to other people .
this is about petra moritz ? seriously ?
no , it &apos;s not about petra per se .
it &apos;s about a journalistic culture
that increasingly kicks sand over ethical boundaries ...
petra has these e @-@ mails ?
yes . of course , petra wants to go with this story tomorrow ,
so if you wanted to scoop her ,
you &apos;d have to get something out tonight .
so ...
if there was nothing going on
between you and your boss ,
how do you explain these e @-@ mails ?
i &apos;m embarrassed to admit it ,
but it was ... a flirtation .
an innocent one , but a wrong one .
i was having difficulties with my husband
at that point , and
i was carried away .
i @-@ i wish that i hadn &apos;t ,
but i &apos;m deeply embarrassed .
but were you having difficulties
with your husband at that point ?
yes , that &apos;s right , i was ...
having difficulties .
and were you embarrassed ?
and i was embarrassed .
um ... i hate to admit it .
let &apos;s talk about your relationship with mr. gardner .
hey .
what &apos;s going on ?
what did wiley ask you ?
he asked about the metadata , but i lied for you .
howell , i told you to tell the truth .
don &apos;t worry , he believed me . i told him we stumbled
on the metadata while i was fixing tickets for you
in the chicago pd traffic system .
what ?
speeding tickets . it &apos;s something i actually do .
i @-@ i told him i fixed two tickets for you .
you had four , but i fixed two to keep up appearances .
howell , i don &apos;t have four speeding tickets .
i @-@ i ... i don &apos;t even have two .
i will make it look like you do . don &apos;t worry so much .
okay , look , uh ...
just tell me everything that you said , okay ?
all right .
mr. andersen . aren &apos;t you and your husband just picking
a fight here ?
objection , badgering ,
inflammatory .
try it again , mr. partridge .
did you have an ulterior motive
in bringing suit against ms. dahl ?
did i have an ulterior motive ?
i guess what i &apos;m asking is ,
were you really so offended by what she did
or did you see this as a test case ?
objection .
it &apos;s a fair question , counselor .
a test ? a case that would allow
you to change the law in your favor .
isn &apos;t that , in fact , why you brought this case ?
no .
i &apos;m in love .
that &apos;s the only reason
i &apos;m doing any of this , by the way .
i &apos;m in love .
nothing further .
i have something further .
why doesn &apos;t anyone ever ask me what i believe ?
they take it for granted i &apos;m not a christian , but
i am . i believe in god , too .
am i proud of my wife ?
more than you can imagine , petra .
winning an election in chicago is ...
difficult .
but winning an election in chicago
with your integrity still intact--
well , that &apos;s practically a miracle .
and alicia florrick has kept hers ?
always .
governor , was your wife sleeping with her boss ,
will gardner ?
oh , well , i ...
i can &apos;t answer that question .
because you don &apos;t want to ?
no , no . because i can &apos;t confirm what you &apos;re asking .
just like , listen , i can &apos;t confirm
that she was ever at a neil young concert .
i can only confirm what my wife has told me ,
which is she did not have an affair
with mr. gardner .
governor , we have copies of e @-@ mails
between your wife and mr. gardner .
which i &apos;m sure you &apos;d love to take
as evidence of a scandalous office romance .
but as my wife told the reporter ted willoughby ,
they are simply an artifact of a flirtation ,
not of an affair .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
as she told the reporter ted willoughby
of channel 8 just a few hours ago ,
those e @-@ mails were part of an unfortunate flirtation .
that &apos;s it .
well , uh , surely the @-@ the ...
the @-@ the language in @-@ in these e @-@ mails
is not , uh , everyday talk between a superior and @-@ and
subordinate .
well , that &apos;s a picture
you seem intent on painting . i guess what my chief of staff
eli gold said to kim masters
in their interview is true .
you &apos;re out to get her .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i ...
i am just trying to reveal the truth ,
governor , and ...
look , petra ,
you &apos;ve been trying to nail alicia for the last three years .
governor ...
you have a grudge against her . you do .
i mean , if you look at any
of your interviews with her ...
okay , thank you ,
thank you . i think we have what we need here .
okay . we &apos;re good ?
yes , and thank you for ... coming down .
oh , no , thank you .
i think that went well .
hey , thank you . good to see you .
okay , thank you .
speeding tickets ?
how many ?
uh , four .
uh , there were four , but he only fixed two for me--
i paid for the other two .
just to keep it kosher ?
yeah .
where &apos;d you get &apos; em ?
two in the loop
and one on the way back from springfield .
the other on the , uh , south side .
that &apos;s exactly what howell said .
almost word for word .
i got to go .
there &apos;s a puppet show at the library .
one last thing , kalinda .
you &apos;re caught .
you faked the metadata .
the longer it takes for you to admit it ,
the worse it &apos;s gonna be for you and diane .
so , i mean , i hate to say this ,
&apos;cause i like you , but ...
if i were you , i &apos;d come clean .
come on .
well , you &apos;ve given this old
con law professor a lot to think about .
on the one hand ,
people have the right to their religious views ,
and they cannot and should not be barred
from the marketplace because of them .
on the other hand , every citizen has the right
not to be discriminated against
on the basis of their race ,
their color , their nationality ,
and yes , their sexual orientation .
well , given all that ,
my task is difficult but clear :
i must weigh whether or not
a religious accommodation
would frustrate the core purpose
of antidiscrimination law .
and in this case ...
i find that it would .
accordingly , i must rule
in favor of the plaintiffs ,
mr. taylor and mr. andersen .
very well done .
diane . can i ask you something ?
what do you think would happen
if every case were adjudicated
by someone with a family member
or loved one who &apos;d be affected by the decision ?
ultimately , perhaps every case is .
but isn &apos;t the law supposed to be impersonal ?
in the sense that it should be the same for everyone ?
you know , otherwise we &apos;re in china ,
right ? everything &apos;s determined by who you know .
the law is supposed to be fair .
not impersonal .
in fact , i would argue
that the law is always personal .
it has to see the human side , too .
or else it &apos;s meaningless .
you &apos;re gonna fund this defense anyway , aren &apos;t you ?
the wedding planner ?
yes .
why ?
three years ago ,
barack obama was against gay marriage .
so was bill clinton . so was hillary .
you know , b @-@ basically every democratic icon
was lined up against gay marriage .
now they &apos;re not . you know ?
because it &apos;s politically expedient for them not to be .
who knows what they &apos;re gonna be for or against
in another three years , right ?
i like people who stand by their opinions .
i like people who stand by their beliefs .
and i think
a religious accommodation
must be made for people who do that .
you know ? it &apos;s the right thing to do .
and as we &apos;ve discussed ,
you &apos;re a highly educated , very confident woman ,
but you walk into this law firm ,
full of old bulls and young tigers . were you nervous ?
oh , very .
that &apos;s nice . very human .
just wait .
during our time together ,
mrs. florrick talked about what she had learned as an attorney .
about the importance of being smart , creative , zealous .
but the question surfacing in recent days is this :
was alicia florrick the candidate too creative ,
too zealous , in her pursuit of the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
what is she talking about ?
i have no idea .
i recently spoke with a chicago election monitor ,
and serious accusations are being made
that the voting machines in some wards
registered votes for frank prady
as votes for alicia florrick .
mother of ...
and that may have been the difference
in the state &apos;s attorney race .
what ? oh ...
we are all in trouble now .
was the election stolen ?
for now we don &apos;t know ...
