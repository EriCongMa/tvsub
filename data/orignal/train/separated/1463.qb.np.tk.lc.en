jay , should i get rid of this ?
the hat , the jacket , or the cane ?
actually , yes . just yes .
we &apos;re having a yard sale for our social studies class
to raise money for unicef .
the point is for us to learn about global altruism .
no , the point is for us
to raise more money than miss cooper &apos;s class
so we get a pizza and a pool party .
your cynicism makes me sad for our world .
ease up , delgado . i &apos;ve seen you with a pizza .
i hate garage sales .
bunch of shady characters going through my stuff .
why can &apos;t i just write a check ?
relax , jay .
it &apos;s just a couple of people in the driveway .
yeah , yeah , yeah . that &apos;s where it starts .
then it &apos;s , &quot; it &apos;s just a local call . &quot;
&quot; can i use your bathroom ? &quot;
&quot; my mother needs to lie down . &quot;
no , it just stinks .
he did write a check .
the less he knows , the better .
you &apos;re not even here anymore .
but it &apos;s my stuff .
where &apos;s mom ? luke , take me to mom .
and move slow . i &apos;m still drunk
ing my coffee . mom !
what &apos;s the problem ?
tell luke not to sell my stuff ?
honey , come on . give it up .
even john mayer doesn &apos;t have a john mayer poster anymore .
it &apos;s signed by him .
it &apos;s time you knew-- they come that way .
but it &apos;s &quot; to haley . &quot;
in a different color . your dad wrote that .
ew ! he wrote &quot; my body is a wonderland . &quot;
i didn &apos;t catch that till after .
mom , is it okay if michael comes to the yard sale ?
well , honey , didn &apos;t you see him last night ?
so ? why don &apos;t you like my boyfriend ?
i do like him .
i &apos;m just 90 % sure he &apos;s 100 % gay .
yes , when michael took me to prom ,
i questioned his sexuality .
but then ... we made out .
a couple times .
there was even a little ... under @-@ the @-@ shirt action .
his chest is very smooth .
heads up ! coming through !
i am glad you &apos;re finally getting rid of that thing .
what ? i &apos;m not selling this bad boy .
i was gonna meet you at your dad &apos;s
and get a little exercise on the way .
what &apos;s , what &apos;s your beef with my streets rider ?
even i think it &apos;s nerdy , and i &apos;m fluent in elvish .
it &apos;s not nerdy . luke , back me up .
i hope you mean into the garage ,
because i have friends on this street .
honey , you finally found something less cool
than those pants that zip off into shorts .
my shants , which you have been gunning for since day one .
does it matter to any of you
that this is actually an extremely efficient cardiovascular workout
that could prolong my life ?
mm , yeah , but what kind of life ? and with whom ?
remember , everyone , this is for charity .
every dollar we earn helps a diseased child ,
a starving child , an abused child .
now have fun !
speaking of starving children , here &apos;s my contribution .
six pair of jeans that don &apos;t fit me anymore
because i &apos;ve lost 25 pounds .
that &apos;s like ... one , two , three children &apos;s bowling balls .
mm , bravo !
very nice .
hey , cam ?
are--are you really getting rid of all these ?
i mean , they &apos;re almost new . it &apos;s ...
well , what if you , um--
what if i what , mitchell ? put the weight back on ?
no ! no .
no , what if you--
you think of some creative art project that requires denim ?
you know , something farm or kelly clarkson @-@ themed ?
or ...
i &apos;ve already done so much with that motif .
yeah . yeah .
you know what ? no , sell &apos; em ! i wanna purge ,
which , for the record , is not how i lost this weight .
oh , every time . every time he loses weight ,
he gets rid of his big pants .
and then when he puts the weight back on ,
he has to buy them all new again .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s a nightmare .
just put the jeans in the car while he &apos;s in the house .
no , dad ! that &apos;s incredibly dis--
i &apos;m gonna do that . yeah .
where you think you &apos;re going with those ?
oh , these aren &apos;t for sale .
hey , this is for charity .
you know you &apos;re taking those jeans out of the hands
of some needy , giant children .
you know they &apos;re not getting the actual jeans , right , luke ?
oh . right . well , then how about a donation ?
20 bucks ?
100 .
$ 20 ?
sure . what &apos;s it to you
if some kid gets sick bathing in poo river , africa ?
how much for the ashtray ?
i don &apos;t know . what &apos;s the tag say ?
50 cents . but there &apos;s a chip in it .
well , that &apos;s why it &apos;s lying on a blanket on my lawn ,
next to some old corn on the cob handles .
i &apos;ll give you 35 .
you &apos;re wearing a $ 10,000 watch .
you &apos;re hagglig over 15 cents ?
you live in this place , and you can &apos;t let that 15 cents go ?
fine . 35 .
can you break a 50 ?
get out .
manny .
what is this case doing here ?
i found it in the attic .
why ? what is it ?
nothing that concerns you .
it &apos;s from colombia .
but i thought you said--
you thought nothing .
it &apos;s going back in the attic , and i want no more questions .
why ?
that &apos;s a question .
that was weird .
too weird .
i wonder what &apos;s in there .
wake up , delgado .
locked box , from colombia ,
&quot; no more questions &quot; ?
it &apos;s obviously a human head .
why is that always your first guess ?
one of these days , i &apos;m gonna be right .
no way !
you &apos;re selling the harley ?
no , i &apos;m just trying to move it out of the way .
some asshat offered me 100 bucks for it .
but with the baby coming , i guess i am gonna sell it .
oh , she &apos;s a beaut .
what , you wouldn &apos;t be interested in it , would you ?
why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
well , i just never thought of you a motorcyle kinda guy .
i would be if claire would ever let me have one .
you can have a motorcycle if you want .
can i also have an affair with my super hot receptionist ?
what super hot receptionist ?
don &apos;t change the subject !
now what would everybody like for lunch ?
you don &apos;t have to buy a motorcycle if you don &apos;t want one .
but don &apos;t blame it on me . i &apos;m fine with it .
seriously ?
yeah .
yeah , look , i know it &apos;s not the safest thing in the world ,
but it is sexy .
yes . a lot more sexy than that crazy machine you rode up on .
is that something that your doctor make you use ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna take this around back ,
unless you &apos;d like to go for a test @-@ drive .
sure . let &apos;s go . not too fast .
precious cargo .
i &apos;m not taking you , sweetheart .
i &apos;m driving ?
awesome !
i &apos;m terrified of motorcycles ,
but sometimes you have to do things to show the world
you &apos;re still a man .
same reason i got that henna tattoo .
japanese symbol for &quot; courage . &quot;
yeah .
oh , michael &apos;s here ! hi , michael !
well , well , well . what is this all about ?
is there a @-@ a new man in alex &apos;s life ?
well , she certainly thinks so .
is there any way that boy is straight ?
ooh , what &apos;s going on ? who are we looking at ?
uh , it &apos;s alex &apos;s new &quot; boyfriend &quot; michael .
what &apos;s up with the air quotes ?
she thinks he &apos;s gay .
i &quot; think &quot; he &apos;s gay the same way
i &quot; think &quot; that lamp is hideous .
ok , brought it . made it art class .
look , i like michael . i really do .
i just--i don &apos;t want her to get her heart broken .
when it comes to boys ,
her self @-@ esteem is low enough as it is .
i don &apos;t know . alex seems pretty darn tough .
oh , she &apos;s just sarcastic on the outside .
inside , she &apos;s just a fragile little girl .
by all means , look right at me when you say that .
if she wants to get her heart broken by a gay guy ,
she can do so when she &apos;s 18 or 19
and can drink her way through it .
aw . you &apos;re a &quot; good mother . &quot;
i don &apos;t know , claire . you could be wrong .
boys aren &apos;t as concerned about traditional masculinity anymore .
you know , they &apos;re not butching it up .
they &apos;re not pushing down their feelings .
yeah , they care about their clothes .
mm @-@ hmm .
they--they--they groom .
mm @-@ hmm .
everybody &apos;s hairless .
yeah , you can &apos;t tell anything anymore .
really ?
uncle mitch , uncle cam , this is michael .
hi !
hello .
okay , come on .
yep , he &apos;s gay .
we stand corrected .
yeah .
okay .
now be careful .
i don &apos;t want you to crash .
oh , oh .
i don &apos;t want the bike all scratched up .
oh .
and don &apos;t be nervous .
people make mistakes when they &apos;re nervous .
i &apos;m not nervous .
i &apos;ve had bigger hogs than this between my legs .
he really oughta run things through his head first .
yeah .
i know i looked super cool on the outside ,
but on the inside , i was terrified .
and then i remembered
that fonzie once put together a whole motorcycle while blind .
and i thought ,
that was a great show ,
and i got really distracted and--and i forgot i was scared .
so i headed up the canyon and i left the city behind .
i &apos;d never felt so exhilarated .
i don &apos;t know exactly when it happened ,
but somewhere on that lonely road ...
the bike and i became one .
ohh . oh , no .
no . oh , you &apos;re heavy !
no ! ohh !
lock the door .
okay , let &apos;s do this .
no matter what we find in here ,
i will always love my mother .
even if it &apos;s a head ?
it &apos;s not a head .
oh , my god ! it &apos;s a head !
ah ! finally !
mitchell !
i was just in the car , and i found my fat pants in there .
do you know anything about that ?
what ? no ! no . did you forget to put &apos; em out ?
no . remember ? i posed , people clapped . .
i had my moment
i do remember that .
that-- oh , that was a great moment .
i am so proud of you .
what &apos;s going on ? you &apos;re being weird .
what ? first , i &apos;m a pants thief
and--and now i can &apos;t pay you a compliment ?
you know who &apos;s being weird ? you .
here comes claire ! hey , girl !
i don &apos;t know what that was .
okay , i just saw alex and michael sittin &apos; in a tree .
don &apos;t make me spell this out for you .
well , what can you do ?
i can &apos;t do anything , but you two could talk to her .
and tell her what ?
michael &apos;s playing for the pink team .
okay , we get to say that . you don &apos;t really .
i know , because you have credibility ,
and i have the opposite of credibility . i have ...
i am a mother .
okay , we &apos;re not doing this .
no .
well , now hold on . just a minute .
you know , when i was ... young and straight ,
i left a trail of broken hearts like a rock star .
i &apos;m not proud of it .
ah , you &apos;re kinda proud of it .
you work it into a lot of conversations .
he brought it up yesterday .
okay , how am i supposed to walk into a dry cleaner
and not mention my girlfriend wendy jo martinizer ?
can we get back to my problem ?
you don &apos;t have a problem , okay ? they &apos;re kids .
they &apos;re gonna work it out .
can you talk to her ?
not when she &apos;s like this .
oh , you mean alex .
yeah . i &apos;ll do it .
thank you .
claire , kids ,
if you &apos;re seeing this , then they found my body .
or i finally got a signal and i sent it to you in an e @-@ mail .
in that case , i &apos;ll just call , but ...
but sometimes you can actually get
a pretty decent data signal and no voice .
i know i &apos;m not making any sense .
i &apos;ve been trapped out here now for ...
27 minutes .
i &apos;m such an idiot .
why did i bring this stupid motorcycle out here ?
to prove i &apos;m a man ?
i am a man .
mom .
manny , what &apos;s this doing here ?
if you don &apos;t mind , we &apos;ll be asking the questions now .
i do mind .
i apologize .
we couldn &apos;t help ourselves .
but i &apos;ve gotta know .
why were you hiding this ?
love this ! sold !
what &apos;s the story here ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it !
aw ! cute !
oh , where &apos;d that come from ?
it &apos;s my mom &apos;s . she &apos;s being very cagey .
we think something &apos;s stashed in the head .
it &apos;s from colombia .
mom , what &apos;s the big deal ?
okay , fine .
when i was young , i was in a beauty pageant .
all the other girls , for their talent ,
were juggling knives , as they always do .
but i wanted to stand out ,
so i came up with ...
uncle grumpy .
okay . never been so happy .
not leaving till i see it .
hit it , gloria .
excuse me , how much is this vase ?
it &apos;s yours . take it .
so what do you need here ?
a stool ? glass of water ?
how do we make this happen ?
let &apos;s go . i need to see this .
you see nothing .
that pageant was one of the worst nights of my life .
after weeks of rehearsing ,
i froze , and we were speechless .
aw , and you lost .
no . i won .
imagine this when i was 18 .
but it was very humiliating .
i don &apos;t want to do it ever again .
and yet , you kept him all these years .
maybe there &apos;s a part of you that wants to work through this ,
get some closure .
you &apos;re wrong , whoever you are .
it &apos;s going on 31 minutes .
i feel so alone .
i gotta get my leg free .
why didn &apos;t i wear my shants ? !
hey , guys . check it out .
you like my new bracelet ?
ooh , cute .
it &apos;s an old curtain ring michael saw over there .
he braided three leather shoelaces around it
and voila .
you know , alex , you and michael remind me so much
of me and my first girlfriend
annabelle pickett .
huh ? you had a girlfriend ?
yeah . cutest girl in sunday school , too .
so one year , i asked her to go
to the church bazaar lip sync contest with me ,
and we did our version of &quot; endless love ... &quot;
which was ironic because two weeks later ,
i fell head over heels
for a young square @-@ jawed rodeo ticket taker named woody ray .
oh , no .
of course , she was devastated , just destroyed her .
and then she spray @-@ painted something unrepeatable
on my daddy &apos;s barn
and never spoke to me again .
wow , and all because
she wanted you to be something you just weren &apos;t .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah .
ugh . stop . i get it .
i know what you think about michael , mom .
you didn &apos;t have to bring in your big gay guns to back you up .
no offense .
none taken .
i kinda like it .
okay . honey , i am worried about you .
i don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
i told them that this was a bad idea , all right ?
you know , maybe michael &apos;s gay . maybe he &apos;s not .
he is .
your mother just wants you to have all the information
so that--that you can go slow .
uncle mitchell , he &apos;s straight .
we kissed .
oh , honey , i ...
i kissed a lot of girls when i wanted to be straight .
and your uncle cam kissed some , too , he says .
but that &apos;s neither here nor there .
what &apos;s important is that you make your own--where--
wait , where are you going ?
it &apos;s not the olden days anymore , you guys .
i can just ask him .
hope you &apos;re happy .
i &apos;m not .
that &quot; olden days &quot; comment was like a punch to the gut .
she may as well have spray @-@ painted it on my daddy &apos;s barn .
yeah , i &apos;m done with this .
where &apos;s he going ?
hey , you got any bread ?
i wanna make sure this thing till works .
yeah , that &apos; not gonna happen .
oh , it doesn &apos;t have to be bread .
i mean , i can get the information i need
from , like , a bagel or a frozen waffle .
look , kid ,
you &apos;re just gonna have to roll the dice on this one .
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s your return policy ?
you return , i call the police .
where &apos;d you get that ?
from the kitchen .
give me that !
you selling the pot @-@ bellied pig ?
get out of my driveway .
you &apos;re not a pig .
you &apos;re daddy &apos;s little girl .
there you are .
hey . sorry .
i got lost in this &quot; elle decor . &quot;
justin timberlake is designing his own home line ,
and i &apos;m trying to reserve judgment .
michael i have to ask you something .
i want you to know it &apos;s okay either way .
but ...
are you gay ?
what ?
no ! i &apos;m not !
i--i took you to prom .
i kissed you .
unless you &apos;re a boy , i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m straight .
are--are you a boy ?
no .
right . so then i &apos;m straight .
i didn &apos;t mean to make you mad .
i &apos;m not mad . i &apos;m just ...
angry .
i &apos;m sorry .
and those are synonyms .
you just know everything today .
can you just give me a minute ?
hey , can i help you ?
yeah . why does everybody think i &apos;m gay ?
god , i hate yard sales .
thank you .
sorry for snooping around and finding your old man doll .
in colombia , if you snoop around the wrong box ,
you might end up inside that box .
i shouldn &apos;t have done it .
now i feel bad for manny .
what do you mean ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s always talking about how brave you are ,
how you &apos;re not afraid of anything .
now ... he just seems a little sad .
how sad ?
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s a good thing .
he needs a little dose of reality .
you walk around school ,
telling everyone how great your mommy is all the time ,
you find yourself on the business end of a wedgie .
i know how to push buttons to get what i want .
and what i want is to see a puppet show .
j &apos;accuse !
i &apos;m sorry . one more time ?
it &apos;s just a dramatic way of accusing you ...
of stashing my fat pants in a bush !
saboteur !
that &apos;s a second way .
how ... could ... you ?
and a third .
why , mitchell ? why ?
cam ... oh , come on .
all right , the ...
this is a little hard to say , but ...
every time you get rid of these pants ,
you have to buy them all over again ,
and you get depressed , all right ?
this is just a way to have a safety net .
i can &apos;t have a safety net , mitchell .
otherwise , i won &apos;t be successful and keep the weight off .
have you ever thought of that ?
no . no , i didn &apos;t .
you know , you &apos;re not the only one who remembers
all the times i failed .
you &apos;re right .
i--i should support you more . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m happy to hear you say that .
well , i &apos;m happy you &apos;re happy .
well , i hope you both are happy .
michael &apos;s not gay . now he hates me .
thanks a lot .
you see ?
this is exactly why i didn &apos;t want to get involved .
now i feel terrible .
these feelings would go good with pie .
there he is !
sweetheart , do you love it ?
no , claire , i do not love it .
oh , that &apos;s too bad &apos; cause you look so cool on that .
do i , claire ? do i really ?
what happened ?
it &apos;s a long story . check your in @-@ box .
but suffice it to say , i &apos;m not buying that motorcycle .
uh @-@ huh .
i know what i am , clare .
i &apos;m not a rider . i &apos;m a strider .
i hope that &apos;s sexy enough for you .
well , i can see stuff .
yeah , i know . i can feel air on it .
it &apos;s not like i have another pair of pants .
oh , uh , today is your lucky day .
it &apos;s for a good cause .
you might need a belt .
oh , i doubt it . i bet we wear the same size .
don &apos;t do that .
copy .
well , we ruined alex &apos;s life , by the way .
i don &apos;t know . she looks okay .
oh , looks like they made up .
if she would just listen to me ,
i could help her avoid so much pain .
give it a rest . she &apos;s 14 , all right ?
no matter who that boy is , he &apos;s not gonna last .
mm , you &apos;re right .
well , at leas with a gay kid ,
you know she &apos;s gonna get a great flower arrangement .
should &apos;ve seen the one i made annabelle .
arranged it myself . it was gorgeous ...
till she pulled it apart and spelled &quot; homo &quot; on my porch .
this doesn &apos;t make me feel any better .
gather around everybody .
i want you to meet somebody .
oh , but that might .
uncle grumpy .
luke &apos;s wise words got to me .
i needed my son to respect me again .
more than that , i needed to respect myself .
holy maracas !
i think i sat on the right lap !
uncle grumpy , we &apos;re in public .
ay , look at all those white faces !
i see we made it over the wall .
uncle grumpy , are you in a bad mood ?
damn right i am ! i just came from the movies .
a whole day &apos;s pay to see &quot; basic instinct . &quot;
oh . and what did you think ?
basically , it stinked .
you &apos;re so grumpy .
damn right i am !
i just met the girl of my dreams .
ay , that &apos;s such great news .
no . she gave me the termites .
gloria , i &apos;m just gonna--
oh , jeez . i don &apos;t even wanna know what this is .
i &apos;m outta here .
you &apos;re leaving ?
damn right .
the only difference between this and a home invasion
is i get to shoot people at a home invasion .
oh , my god . she married her puppet .
uncle grumpy !
can anyone hear me ? !
please help me !
i don &apos;t wanna die !
if i had to make a playlist
for being trapped under a motorcycle ,
it &apos;d be , um ...
&quot; stuck in the middle , &quot; &quot; hit the road jack , &quot;
um , anything by heavy d.
ooh , pointer sisters , &quot; neutron dance . &quot;
turns out today wasn &apos;t
the first day of the rest of my life .
oh , my goodness .
there &apos;s some dvds in a shoe box in , uh , my closet
that i was holding for ... a buddy .
um , you can go ahead and just throw the whole box away .
i &apos;m so hungry .
i don &apos;t know how long i &apos;m gonna be out here .
i gotta ration my food .
