Fish on!
I'm starving.
Good morning.
What are you looking for?
A piece of bread or a muffin.
In your world, a croissant.
Carbs.
Yes.
Empty calories.
Bingo.
Well, you're not gonna find anything,
'cause your mother is on a new diet.
Well, that still involves food, right?
I never slept better.
We were wondering.
Feel my hair -- thick, right?
Feels hairy.
Silky.
Thank you.
Don't bother. There's no food in there.
Nothing white.
Is this a goal...
for...humans... that eat food?
There's a scientific basis for it.
No white rice, no white flour, no white sugar.
Pop-tarts?
Well -- well, it's browne flour, when you cook them.
Is that what I taught you?
Yes!
You taught me that food is fuel. Grab it, go.
Well, then, I'm sorry.
There's a healthier way to eat that makes you feel better.
And this is it.
Ma, you look great. You don't need to go on a diet.
Thank you, baby, but I'm not doing it to diet or lose weight.
I do it to have more energy.
Yeah, and eating more colorful fruits and vegetables
increases our intake of phytochemicals,
which is linked to decreased rates of
heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.
Et voila.
You guys expect a lot out of your food.
I just expect mine to get me from breakfast to lunch.
And this diet will do it.
It's gluten-free muesli, berries, and non-fat yogurt.
What color's your yogurt?
I could make you French toast.
You wouldn't even know it was kale.
Gross, ma.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Got to go, ma.
I'm gonna bring you a snack at work.
Chocolate cake!
Oh, god. Really?
What? It's not white.
Why is it that when someone wants to make
a major life change, they go on a diet?
Well, don't you feel better when you eat better?
Yes, when I have the right amount of
sugar and caffeine and alcohol, I feel amazing.
Okay, so, cupcakes, red bull, and a martini.
You don't have to get all fancy with it.
I'd take coffee and a shot of whisky any day.
Anybody would have answered Gordie Howe.
I didn't specify American Hockey.
What's up?
Oh, Frankie lost a bet, and I get to pick his punishment.
But you're probably talking about the crime scene, though.
I got the vic's keys.
I'm gonna go check the lot for his car.
Canadian hockey.
The victim is Mark Harris, 32.
Took a single arrow to the back.
Actually, a bolt. From a crossbow.
A bolt is smaller than an arrow, and it's metal.
This is likely from a pistol grip.
It's easy to get, easy to hide.
A shooter would need to be within 35 yards
for an accurate shot.
Any other injuries?
Well, it looks like some bruising
from the fall after being shot.
He was competing in a very
important regional bass-fishing tournament.
Really? Very important?
Winner here gets $100,000 and goes to the nationals.
Top prize there is $500,000.
Very imporant it is.
He was in the lead.
With what he had in his tank,
it would have been very difficult for anybody to beat him.
Crossbow's kind of perfect for the environment.
I mean, it's completely quiet.
And not unusual for an outdoorsman to have one.
He has a sunburn on one side of his face.
So it's likely he was dead in the boat for hours.
I'm surprised none of the other fishermen saw him.
Well, the water's too shallow for bass here.
Nobody would have come by.
What is it?
This blood pooling. Something's not right.
What are you thinking?
I'm gonna have to investigate further.
Surprise, surprise.
Hey, Jane. You there?
Yeah, I found his car.
Okay. I'll be right there.
This is the car Mark Harris drove?
Yeah.
Doesn't really fit in, does it?
I'm guessing Mark Harris didn't really fit in either.
According to tournament officials,
he was a college professor -- taught poetry.
Oh, well, that's the perfect training
for becoming a fisherman.
I know. It doesn't make any sense.
It also doesn't make sense that he was leading the tournament.
The emergency contact on his phone is his wife, Carla.
I'll give her a call.
Okay.
Jane?
Yeah?
This is Skeet Martin.
He was fisng in the competition.
He wants to talk to you. Only you.
This is Detective Rizzoli. Excuse me.
Do you know something about what happened here this morning?
Uh, no.
Did you know Mark Harris?
No, ma'am.
So, why did you need to talk to me?
Well, I tried to hire a skywriter with my cellphone,
but I couldn't seem to get any reception.
A skywriter?
To ask you out to dinner.
That's it?
And to watch the sunset.
I don't have time for this.
Hey, we don't have to talk about fishing.
I -- or we can talk about fishing,
if it'll help your case.
Is it the air? Is it the trees?
There's just group insanity going --
What are you doing?
Fish scales.
Well, can you sniff the tires and tell me where the car's been?
It's addressed to Mark. Probably Harris.
"Say anything, and you'll sleep with these."
That's not very original.
Somebody threatened him. He didn't take it seriously.
Well, he had about 100,000 reasons not to.
Same number of reasons somebody would had to want him dead.
Mark was a college professor -- Elizabethan poetry.
He loved it.
When he was denied tenure, it was an enormous blow.
What happened after he lost his job?
He looked and looked for another.
When he couldn't find one, he fell apart.
So did our marriage.
We filed for divorce.
How did he get involved with, uh, competitive fishing?
He went up to Maine to a friend's cabin by a lake
to clear his head
and work on his long-neglected book of poetry.
But mark had writer's block.
So, one day,
Mark went fishing to take the pressure off
and found out he was a natural.
The fish just... came to him.
He entered a tournament and won.
And he won tournament after tournament.
When was the last time you saw your husband?
The first day of the tournament.
Um, I brought him the divorce papers
so he could sign them and embrace his new life.
And did he?
No.
He ripped up the papers.
This was to be his last tournament.
He wanted to come back home.
Well, Mrs. Harris, thank you for coming in.
And, um, we're very sorry for your loss.
If you think of anything else...
Uh, Mark did mention one name.
Um, the woman who made his lures --
Linda Hendrickson -- she was his confidante.
I'm sorry to ask, but do you happen to know
the nature of their relationship?
Friends.
I think.
We were separated when they met,
so if it was something else, that's okay.
God, it doesn't matter now.
None of this matters now.
Hi. Is the autopsy done yet?
Uh, Kent's finishing up the report.
So, do you want the bad news or the bad news?
Mm, you pick.
The threatening note to Mark Harris
was on standard paper, with standard ink,
using a standard printer.
There are no fingerprints.
What's the bad news?
No prints. No markings.
This is a standard 436-gram bolt
fired from a 350-foot-per-second crossbow.
Conclusion -- we have nothing.
Ding, ding, ding!
What's with the fish tanks?
Uh, they were in Mark's live well,
so they're evidence -- I brought them back here,
but now I don't really know what to do with them.
This one likes me.
He's probably swimming toward his reflection.
Can't he just like me?
Fish are actually drawn to changes in light.
Sports-fishing boats sometimes use bright lights
to draw them to the surface.
You fish, Kent?
Only for food. Same way I hunt.
Did you hunt and skin your belt?
Of course.
The autopsy report on Mark Harris.
Oh, he seems lovely.
Yeah, I am not sure I understand what's going on with that guy.
I keep telling you to throw him back in.
Or hunt him.
Maura?
Mark was on Coumadin.
Oh, the blood thinner?
He bled out quickly.
So, any wound would have been fatal
if he didn't get help right away.
It also means the shooter
didn't have to be good. He just had to hit him.
Which means the shot could have been fired
from as far away as 60 yards.
Which means we have a lot more suspects.
There were 60 contestants.
I used each boat's GPS trackers to narrow the search
to boats within crossbow range of the victim
at the estimated time and place of death.
Better.
The M.E. also sent up forecasts of the bullet trajectory.
I'm gonna input those
and see if it eliminates a few more boats.
Great.
I'll check back in with you later.
Time to pay off your bet. Meet your flour baby.
You have to take care of that as if it's your very own baby.
It's how they teach responsibility to teenagers.
While you're in the station,
care for that as if it's your very own.
For how long?
One day. Be a good dad.
Every time you're not, I add a day.
This is silly, but easy.
We'll see.
Oh, I got this.
We'll see.
Linda Hendrickson's dad was a champion fisherman.
She grew up on lakes across New England.
Doesn't seem like much of a love connection
for an ex-professor of Elizabethan poetry.
Strange thing, love.
Oh, do enlighten me.
I would, but we're here.
Come in!
Hi. Um, I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.
This is Detective Vince Korsak.
Yeah, hi. Linda. Just give me a sec.
I'm...baking. Sorry about the smell.
No, no. It's -- it's, uh - Horrible.
They're very effective, but they stink.
Um...we, uh -- we wanted to talk about Mark Harris.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. It's so sad. It's just a tragedy.
Um, wh-what was the status of your relationship?
Well, at first, I thought he was just lonely --
Or horny, like they get after eight hours on the lake.
But, uh, you know, it turns out
he was a sponge for knowledge about fishing.
So, he was a customer?
At first.
Then...well, after eight hours in this kitchen,
it makes me want some air and some contact.
How long were you two together?
Not long. I broke it off.
Mark wasn't my kind of guy.
I got to say, I'm surprised he was your kind of guy
even for a little while.
It's tough for me to meet men.
You're surrounded by men.
So are you.
Does that make it easier?
Was there anyone you know that might have wanted to harm Mr. Harris?
That's a list of everyone in the tournament.
They were all jealous of Mark. They accused him of cheating.
Did he cheat?
Oh, Mark didn't know enough to cheat.
Unlike everyone on that list.
So you're saying they're all cheaters?
A fisherman's just a cheater who hasn't been caught.
It's another reason I don't date fishermen.
Except Mark Harris.
Well, he was a poet... who fished.
My next batch is a really smelly one.
Well, uh, thank you for your time.
Can I keep this?
Sure.
No wonder the only empty spot on the lot is next to that.
Mark Harris doesn't strike me as the kind of guy
that would have have two beautiful,
but totally different women in his life.
Well, women can see past looks.
Yeah. Men can't.
No, that's why we wear makeup and heels.
Because you all like the shiny stuff.
Detective Rizzoli! Hi.
Hello.
I, uh -- I brought you a gift.
To help you with your case.
Thank you.
It's a book on bass.
And a split of champagne.
Now, you can have that yourself or bring it down to my boat.
We can drink it together, watch the sunset, and talk fish.
Skeet, I-I'm -- I'm sorry. I --
This is business. But, please, think about it.
Hey, this is Skeet.
Shiny jacket.
Shiny.
You rang?
Yes.
There is something very interesting about the big fish
that was found in Mark's livewell when he died.
Is that the fish that kept swimming toward me?
The cute one?
Yes.
You killed him because you were jealous.
Well, he was sick.
Which is why he kept swimming around repetitively
and banging into the glass.
Sick with love!
Well, I cured him.
The DNA of the stomach contents
shows that this fish is not from this pond.
And it ate plants not from this region.
And he was bigger than the bass found in this pond.
So, either Mark found out someone was cheating --
Or Mark was cheating.
Give my friend a proper burial.
Do you like fish tacos?
What?
Where's Frankie Jr. Jr.?
I had him with me, ran down to the car,
then Nina called and --
You left him in the car?
Yeah.
In a car seat?
No.
With the windows rolled down?
No.
Poor Frankie Jr. Jr. gone too soon.
Another day with a flour baby for you.
What?!
Another day.
No way. Come on, Kor--
Factoring in wind speed and distance the bolt would travel,
we're left with these three suspects.
Boyd Jones, Cliff Davis, Jay Butler.
And all three were in striking distance of first place.
Jones and Davis have been brought in.
Jay butler left the tournament early.
Do we know where he is?
No, but he's signed up for a tournament in northern maine.
Right near the Canadian border.
Yeah, I'll put a bolo out on him.
Okay.
Korsak's making me --
I don't want to know.
Boyd Jones and Cliff Davis are ready for questioning.
Fun fact -- they were both caught cheating in the past.
We'll interview them.
Let me know what you find out.
N-nina? Would you mind keeping an eye on Francesca for me?
Sure.
How did you come up with "Francesca"?
Seriously?
No.
Did you know Mark Harris?
We fished in the same tournaments.
If you call what he was doing "Fishing."
Brand-new to the sport,
but he'd won three of the last eight tournaments.
Yeah, the guy's a poet.
Were you friends with Mark Harris?
"Friends"? Are you kidding me?
He combs our lakes.
He takes our fish. He takes our women.
Uh, you mean, uh, Linda Hendrickson?
I asked her out four times.
Yeah, she thought she was better than me.
Sounds like that bothered you big time.
Did he figure out you were cheating?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, come on, sport.
Two tournaments ago,
one of the fish you "Caught" was partially frozen.
Nature's mysterious.
You put weights down the throats of your fish.
Allegedly.
Uh, y-you had a secret storage compartment in your boat.
I say it was a cooler for beer.
Do you own a crossbow?
Of course.
Don't you?
Listen, I hope
that you catch whoever it is that killed this guy.
And I hope you figure out how he cheated.
What makes you think he cheated?
What do you think? Fish just jumping into his boat?
When you do...
Would you tell me how he was doing it?
On the sly?
I won't tell anyone.
Um, can you tell me
where I might find detective Jane Rizzoli?
Her desk is in the squad room.
Okay. Thanks.
Are you, uh -- are you working on that, uh, Mark Harris murder?
I need you to leave.
'Cause I was in that tournament. So, if you need any --
Sir, I'm in the middle of important police business,
Thanks for watching Francesca for me.
I am gonna keep this flour baby alive.
I'm not gonna give Korsak the satsifa--
There was a bet and...
Well, you know, good luck
with that important police business.
Linda was right.
It was a lake full of cheaters and wannabe cheaters
and cheaters who haven't been caught yet.
Bassholes.
You kiss your daughter with that mouth?
Nice lamp.
Oh. Yeah, the department's redecorating.
You get the matching chair.
How's the puzzle?
I feel like a piece is missing out of the box.
Mark Harris made a $50,000 deposit
the day before the tournament started.
What?
From Big Rod's Sporting Goods.
They hired Mark to be their spokesman
for their competition fishing line.
Okay, this whole fishing thing --
I know, I've got to redo my profile on Match.com
to add "Pro fishermen welcome."
Wait a minute, after the tournament started,
he withdrew $50,000 -- what's up with that?
I don't know.
He got a money order for cash. Maybe it's some sort of payoff.
The same day he was killed?
The same day Jay Butler disappeared.
Did you know that because of all the pollution,
the bass are changing sexes,
with the males carrying the eggs?
Oh. It's about time.
You did not know that.
Yes, I did.
I read it in a science journal. You?
I read it in that book Skeet gave me.
Interesting.
Skeet?
The book.
And the picture...
he drew.
He put a sex drawing in a fish book?
What is wrong with you?
No, he drew a picture of me fishing.
It's very flattering.
Waders are a nice look on you.
Okay, what are we searching for, again?
Evidence that the fish I autopsied was transported to
and somehow held in this lake.
Which might help us figure out who planted it there.
And that would lead us to the killer.
We discussed all this in the car.
Did we?
Oh, I see. You just needed a break, didn't you?
No.
Okay.
I was just recapping.
Why can't we do this with a motor?
Because it will scare the fish,
and fear does not equal attraction,
which is what's so interesting about Skeet.
He's not afraid of you.
Well, I'm not interested in Skeet.
Because you're afraid.
I am not afraid of Skeet.
No, you're just afraid that Skeet doesn't look like
what you thought you were looking for.
Well, I'm not sure what I'm looking for,
but I can tell you one thing -- it's not Skeet.
And if I have to look at that jacket --
Wait! Stop!
What? You got to talk.
How come I don't get to say anything?
No, no, no. No, no.
What?
Look. Look, look, look.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay.
Do not let me slip.
Careful.
I think I know what those clips held.
Big, big bass.
Tell me why you left the tournament early.
Because of the thing with Mark.
The "thing"? You mean his murder?
Yeah. Because of that, the tuornament was suspended.
Well, you don't seem very upset about Mark Harris' death.
We weren't friends.
I got that.
Look, I-I was upset that I wouldn't be able to fish.
But I didn't know when it would start again or if it would.
Anyway, there -- there was no way I could win, so I-I left.
You finished second to Mark Harris three times.
First place was $100,000. Second place was $5,000.
It had to make you angry.
I don't play for second.
Especially not to Mark Harris.
You're damn straight.
It had to make you angry knowing that
he was a better fisherman than you were.
Mark Harris is a cheater! All right?!
Okay. Tell me how he cheated.
I-I don't know.
But he won more than any of us,
a-and he didn't know a damn thing about bass fishing.
Well, he knew enough to win.
Look, Rosie Ruiz won the Boston Marathon.
Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France.
Fishing is a cruel mistress. Nobody wins all the time.
God. Mark Harris did.
How many years have you been a fisherman?
My whole life.
And that number will remain private, if you don't mind.
Ever cheated?
Look, sometimes the rules change.
It takes a while to catch up.
I don't know what Mark Harris did.
But, if I was you, I would talk to his girlfriend, Linda.
Ex-girlfriend.
Ex?
Yeah. Rules change.
Maybe.
But someone didn't like it.
I parked my RV next to Linda's.
I had to move it.
They were fighting all night. I couldn't sleep.
Thanks for coming in.
You think he's telling the truth?
Well, the spot next to Linda's RV was empty.
Could have been the smell.
Maybe.
It could also be that this murder
is not about fishing.
Korsak?
Yep.
I'm not betting with him anymore.
What did he make you do?
That's horrible.
Wait a minute. Is that Korsak's face?
On a Bolotianyk.
A what?
A swamp spirit from Slavic folklore.
It was supposed to be temporary.
It's not?
Korsak keeps finding ways to tell me I've screwed up.
It's been redrawn a bunch of times.
How long have you had it?
Six months.
Oh, my god.
We should all know better than to bet with Korsak.
Well, I do now.
Wait!
Lost a bet, huh?
Hey, Korsak! I'm doing good!
No more days for me!
Oh, come on.
Let's not name the next one.
Hurts too bad when you fail.
If Jane asks, you rowed.
You two have a unique relationship, don't you?
I'm still trying to figure it out.
Me too.
So, do you know where we're going?
The spot where Mark caught his last fish.
It still seems strange,
this whole idea of fishing as a sport.
Well, imagine how the fish feel.
Do you follow any sports?
The usual things -- arm wrestling, the caber toss.
I can never tell when you're joking.
I know.
It's getting close. Right around here.
All right.
There it is.
Can you give me a hand?
Got it?
Go! Be free!
Until you bite down on some shiny piece of plastic
and somebody with a brightly colored shirt
pulls you from your watery home,
weighs you, measures you, and flings you back into the air.
Is that fish empathy
or another indicator of a bizarre world view?
Um, bit of both, I guess.
This is probably the spot where Mark was when he was shot.
Now, the bolt entered Mark Harris' back
just below his neck.
If you were aiming from a boat,
you would aim for the largest area -- the back.
And at 35 yards, the path would drop about 10 inches.
So if the crossbow was fired from a boat --
Then the bolt would have entered the victim's lower back.
Well, that rise is about 50 yards away --
well within range.
Starting with that hight aiming over victim's head...
The crossbow shot would have dropped about 4 to 6 inches
and lodged itself in the victim's upper back.
So Mark Harris was killed by someone standing on the shore.
Hey! Garcia! How are you?
Oh, good. Thanks, Mrs. Rizzoli.
You look hungry.
Well, starving, actually.
Well, you're in luck because I baked some goodies.
They're super healthy.
I made them with cricket flour, hemp, and agave.
Yeah, go ahead. Take one.
Or, I mean, if you can't decide, take a couple.
I'm on a diet,
But thanks so much, Mrs. Rizzoli.
What? Is everybody on a diet around here?
Hey, Nina. Have you seen Frankie?
No, I haven't.
Angela, I don't know what you're doing,
but you look fantastic.
Really?
Really.
I'm on this "Nothing White" diet.
It's really strict.
Sounds impressive.
Yeah. I hate it.
I mean, all I want is white bread, white pasta,
and a little sugar sprinkled on top.
I'm sorry. I have to go.
Okay. Well, it was nice talking to you.
You too.
What the heck?
Mark had a sponsorship deal
with Big Rod's Sporting Goods.
I know.
Why is that funny?
Because it's amazing -- the irony.
Mark, he didn't like to handle fish
when we had a barbecue.
It was a very lucrative deal.
He got a first payment of $50,000,
which he withdrew the day that he was killed.
You have any idea what happened to that money?
I have it.
He asked me to mail the check in for him.
It's a lot of money.
I know.
Mark wanted to prove to me
that he was making a clean break from fishing,
that he was committed to our marriage.
And we didn't have financial problems.
Does this have something to do with why he was killed?
That's what we're trying to figure out.
I don't understand this. I don't understand any of this.
Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Harris.
Well, somebody's lying.
Carla?
No. Everybody else.
Jane!
I've got to go do that thing.
Jerk.
How do you keep getting in here?
I'm friendly.
Okay.
Hey, look.
I have a reservation at Providence tonight.
Have dinner with me.
There's a two-week wait to get a table at that place.
Well, they knew me. They serve fish.
Okay, Skeet...
I don't want to go out with you.
Why?
Because.
Okay. I hear you.
I don't understand it, but I hear you.
I mean, it's obvious you're attracted to me.
Your respiration is elevated,
your skin color's slightly red, your pupils are dilated.
Or...it's hot and I'm tired
And it's dark in the hallway.
Jane, don't let your head rule your heart!
Goodbye, Skeet.
What's up?
I remodeled the flight projections
for the crossbow bolt.
Given the rate of drop per yard traveled,
and the height of the entry in the victim's back --
Maura, you're talking equations.
Jane don't like equations.
The crossbow bolt that killed Mark Harris
was fired from the shore,
from a rise just behind the reeds.
That's a good place to hide.
And the height makes up for the extra drop
with the added distance.
That's what I was trying to say.
You know, when Carla Harris talked about Mark,
her breathing was very even, her pupils weren't dilated.
She was probably grieving.
But when Linda Hendrickson talked about him,
she got really red, her breathing was very shallow.
It's possible that she was still in love with him
and he was going to leave her.
Ain't love grand?
Mark was taking a prescription for blood thinners.
Oh, yeah?
We found this receipt for Coumadin.
As it turns out,
it was your credit card that paid for it.
So?
So that means you knew about it.
Well, I don't understand where this is going.
Mark entered eight tournaments.
You were not an official for two of them,
where he finished 83rd and 95th.
It happens.
Yes, it does.
In the six that did you officiate,
he won all of them.
So?
Do you own a crossbow?
Everyone owns a crossbow.
Well, everyone does not own a set of WS16 snow chains.
That look familiar?
Now, we're gonna piece all of this together
and trace it back to you.
The matching snow chain. The note you left on his hood
we'll find a draft on your hard drive.
So...
What happened, Linda?
He was hopeless.
He was so cute, but he was human fish repellent.
You taught him to cheat?
No.
So, you're saying he caught those fish legitimately?
No.
You cheated for him.
He never knew.
You know, I changed the weights on his tally sheet.
I salted the waters where I knew he'd be fishing.
I snuck extra fish into his bait tank.
See, he was a poet. He saw what he wanted to see.
I just wanted him to be happy.
What changed?
The endorsement deal
with Big Rod's sporting goods.
I mean, we could have been king and queen of the lakes,
but that wasn't enough for him.
And that made you angry.
Oh, you think?
They were gonna put Mark on the cover
of a sporting-goods catalogue
so that other city guys would buy more fishing rods.
But me, with all of my knowledge,
I could never get that.
I could never be the face of Big Rod's, but he could.
And I did that for him.
I gave that to him.
And he was throwing it all away.
He was going back to his wife.
So you told him about the cheating?
Well, I thought if -- if he knew,
then he'd realize how much I l-loved him.
But he said that he had to come clean.
Confess.
Which would have exposed you.
I would have lost everything that I've built.
He was so ungrateful.
I mean, he had nothing to lose!
Just his life.
Uh, Jane!
And that is good work.
Look, I, uh, just came to say goodbye.
And I'm sorry if...
I made you feel uncomfortable.
No, Skeet, wh -- look --
I-I know we're not going on a date,
but would you at least come out on my boat
and watch the sunset with me?
I just don't have that kind of time.
10 minutes.
Then I'm gone. You'll never see me again.
10 minutes.
Clock it.
You must know an amazing shortcut to the water.
Uh, I never said that we were going to the water.
Seven minutes.
Thank you.
Gorgeous.
Um, okay. A toast.
To Jane, who I will forever be thinking about
when I'm in my boat.
Well, I don't really know about that.
Well, I'll just have you know that this little baby
used to be called the Skeetster.
I thought it was bad luck to change the name of a boat.
I don't believe in luck. I believe in attraction.
Give me a call next time you come to Boston.
So...Skeet?
Mm. So what?
Well, I think you find him alluring.
Respiration increasing, skin beginning to flush.
Yes, doctor. I am completely infatuated.
Here you are.
I don't think she understands the laws of attraction.
Shall I explain? I'm sort of an expert.
How is that?
I've been married three times.
So you get them on the line, but...
They wriggle away.
I got to work on that with Kiki.
How much longer do I have to be a flour daddy?
To be decided -- you killed the first two,
and you don't even know where the last one is yet.
Enjoy.
They're white. Is that a trick?
No. Vanilla cake, vanilla frosting.
They look great.
Yes. I found a bag of flour at the station.
Well, I couldn't resist.
You're done.
Francesco the third, come to papa.
Frankie!
With the paper and all?
