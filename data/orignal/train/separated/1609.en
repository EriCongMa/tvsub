Please come home, A.J.
I can't do that to Ty.
Mom, I'm just afraid that if he stays with his brother,
he's gonna get in some real trouble.
A.J, we're arresting your brother
because he was involved in a hit-and-run
that injured Mariana and Jesus,
but we're gonna have to take you in for running away.
I'm here to see A.J. Hensdale.
You're not on his list.
It's open auditions, right?
All right, but aren't you gonna be too busy
with junior class president and all that?
I lost. Lexi won.
I'm Jesus, your son.
You gotta leave.
Why?
I can't... legally be around you.
Do you know about privatized homes?
If there's something we could do about that?
The most important thing for us
to do right now is to look at the big picture.
We're doing a skin-sparing mastectomy.
How can I help?
I'm scared.
35% of foster kids will be incarcerated
at some point before they reach age 18.
66% of foster kids who age out
will end up either homeless, in jail, or dead
within one year.
How could we expect otherwise
when this is how we care for them?
I was one of the lucky ones.
曾被寄养
After seven different foster placements,
I finally found a home... and a family.
But, as someone who barely survived it,
I can tell you the system is severely broken.
Help kids like me find the homes they deserve.
Support SB-3301.
So, what do you think?
Well, it's very, very powerful.
Yeah, we think so.
I guess we just didn't realize that Callie would be supporting
some new piece of legislation.
I'm sorry.
I assumed you knew.
We're trying to make some real change here.
Yeah, and the statehouse is where that happens.
Right.
That's a good thing, right?
We're not saying that it's not, but...
It's just that you're endorsing a bill
that we know nothing about, Cal.
Have you read it?
No, not like word for word...
Okay.
But I know that it's trying to reform the system,
and I trust Justina.
Well, we certainly don't mean to suggest...
But you kind of are.
You know what, Callie?
Your moms are absolutely right. You should all read it.
I'll get you a copy as soon as I can.
Thank you.
That would be great. Appreciate it.
You know, there is something I've been waiting to tell you, Callie.
Apparently, the work we've been doing has been getting a lot of attention,
and... we have been invited to the White House next month.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Yeah, they're having a symposium on foster care,
and they want us to be there.
Wow. That's amazing.
Of course, we need to look at the calendar...
Callie's school work and all that.
Of course.
Okay, I'm gonna go and I'll talk to you later, Callie.
I'll let myself out.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Bye.
Take it easy. It's not been that long since surgery.
What is wrong with you guys?
Excuse me?
It's the White House.
Yes. It is a great opportunity, Callie,
And hopefully you can go.
Hopefully?
You have a lot on your plate already, honey.
We can't let Fost and Found and all of this
distract you from your school work.
It's not.
What about your senior project?
You still haven't even declared what you're doing.
I have it figured out.
I'm gonna talk to Rita tomorrow.
Okay, good.
So, what's the problem?
Callie,
we really don't know Justina at all.
But I do, and she's doing a lot for me.
And why are you always so suspicious of everyone?
No, hold on. Wanting to read the bill
that you are being used to support
is not being suspicious, Callie, it's being smart.
I'll get it.
Oh, unless you guys are afraid it's home invasion.
Hey, Callie.
I just want you guys to know how bad I feel about what happened.
Look, I know my brother did a terrible thing...
and then we just took off after all the...
You're doing great.
After all the nice stuff you guys did for me...
I should've made Ty turn himself in, but I was just...
I was afraid I wasn't gonna see him again.
So, anyway...
I'm sorry.
We get it, A.J.
Family is everything.
It's good of you to come here
and say all of that, A.J. Thank you.
Yeah. Good job.
I'll wait outside.
Hey, you got a sec?
I just... wanna know how you are doing.
Well, for 10 days since the surgery,
I'm doing pretty well.
That was really brave.
Which part?
Me running away or missing my grandma's funeral?
No, I meant...
I know what you meant, Callie.
Did they tell you I tried to come see you in juvie?
Like, a few times?
I had no idea what your brother had done
when I told Stef where you were.
I swear to you. And as soon as I found out,
I called you.
Have you heard from Ty?
I got a letter from him.
That's good.
Is he okay?
I'm gonna go wait in the car.
Yeah. It's killing me, though. Too slow.
Things have been drying up for me.
You guys been keeping busy?
You want one, right?
I told you... stay away from me.
I know you did, and I know why, too.
I know what you are. You're disgusting.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't want it.
I don't want anything from you.
There you are. I haven't seen you in forever.
Yeah, I know. I've just been so busy, you know?
Tell me about it.
This whole student government thing is a lot of work.
Okay. I've gotta get to class.
Hey. How's your mom?
A lot better. Thanks for asking.
You're welcome.
So, does that mean I get to take you out now, or...
You are really gunning for those french fries, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no, 'cause you kept me waiting for two weeks,
you owe me french fries plus interest.
Yeah, it's a full-on date now... all four food groups.
Fine.
Sweet.
Hey, where is Jesus? Is he sick today or something?
So, for the student council's community outreach project this year,
here's what I was thinking.
I thought if we take this space in City Heights
and turn it into a park or a community garden.
It's very impressive.
And I was thinking,
if I design the gardens and oversee the execution,
it could also be my senior thesis.
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Actually...
since the school funds the outreach program,
it could be perceived that we are also funding your thesis,
which is against the rules.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah, I'll just... I'll think of something else.
What if she got the materials donated?
Yeah. I guess that could work.
Yeah, I bet if you show the local nurseries what we just saw,
they'll be lining up to help.
Thank you.
That's... that's a great idea.
Yeah.
I'll try, thank you.
She's an incredible young woman, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.
Where did you go this morning?
What?
You missed first period. Where were you?
It's none of your business.
Fine. I'll tell mama.
I went to give Gabe his tool belt back.
What? Why?
Because I didn't want it anymore.
So... why not throw it away?
Because I wanted to tell him that we know what he did.
Who cares?
I do!
All right? I care.
You want a to write a paper about me?
Yeah, for my senior thesis.
Well, what about me?
I don't know, like, how good you are at your job,
and everything you do here at GU.
I haven't really figured it out yet,
but you're like my mentor.
Plus my moms are all over me to pick something,
so I told them I was gonna do this.
Well, I'm very honored.
I'm sure we could work something out.
So, you know what?
I was looking at the new and improved "Fost and Found" app,
it looks really great.
Yeah, I know, right?
And it looks... so real and important.
Yeah, it's impressive.
I... I got invited to the White House.
What?
For the foster care symposium?
Yeah. I mean, if my moms let me go.
Oh, come on, why wouldn't they let you go?
I guess they're not too excited
about the work I've been doing with Justina.
Why not? What's going on?
She's been working on this foster reform bill.
Oh. She's the one behind that.
Yeah. Stef got really weird and suspicious
and said she wanted to read the whole thing.
No, you know, honey,
they're just being your moms. That's their job.
You know they're really proud of you, right?
I guess. They're so annoying.
What?
It's funny to hear you sound like a normal teenager.
Shut up. How's that for a normal teenager?
Sure, that's good too.
So, have you read it, the bill?
No, she hasn't sent it over yet.
I did.
How'd you get it?
I'm very connected.
It's my business. It wasn't hard.
And?
There's some good things in it,
but it does allocate
over 50% of the state foster care budget to privatized homes.
What? No, okay, that doesn't make any sense,
'cause Justina's against privatization.
Not if she supports this bill, she isn't.
Hey, stranger.
Long time no see.
Guessing my kid's car seat really scared you off, huh?
Actually, my mom had surgery,
so I had to take some time off.
Oh. Sorry.
Is she okay?
Yeah.
Good.
Well, it's probably a good thing that we got to...
put the brakes on things.
You're too young to be dating a woman with a kid, right?
Don't tell me what I think.
And the big highlight of my day was being shown up by my boss
in front of the student body president. That was great.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, it's just, you know, frustrating.
Hey, so... I'm kind of worried about Jesus.
What? What? Why?
Well, he found our birth dad.
Jesus! Get in here, please.
But that's not all.
The guy's a sex offender.
I was looking him up online
and he's on the sex offender registry thingee.
Look, I only worked with him for a few days.
You worked with him, Jesus?
Stef, calm down.
I didn't tell them that part.
No, no, wait, okay, listen to me, the two of you.
You are never to go near this man again.
Do you hear me? All right?
You have no idea who you are dealing with.
He could be very, very dangerous,
and this is not me overreacting.
This is not me giving you
a parental warning that you can just ignore,
because you think that I'm being ridiculous.
This could be very serious. You understand me?
No, no, I want to hear you say "Yes."
Yes.
Yes, thank you.
Hey, man.
I... I wasn't gonna say anything,
'cause it seemed like it was never actually gonna happen,
but I'm taking your sister out tonight.
What? Who? Callie?
No, your twin sister.
No, no, that's... that's impossible,
see, 'cause we have this "no dating each other's friends" policy
that she made.
Well, I guess she's in violation.
Yeah. I guess she is.
Cool, now that the cat's out of the bag,
I could use some advice.
I wanna, you know, impress her, so tell me... what should I do?
I got just the thing.
Ooh! You look great.
Thank you. I want you to meet my moms.
This is Nick.
Hello.
Hi, nice to see you again.
Oh! Is that your Challenger out there?
It is, yeah.
Oh. You know I'm a cop, yeah?
Well, actually, it's not...
I know
pretty much all of the cops in town,
and if you go two miles
over the speed limit, I will hear about it.
And after I impound your car,
you will never see my beautiful daughter again.
She's kidding.
No.
So, where... where are you guys headed tonight?
Yeah.
Oh, we're just gonna grab a burger, you know?
Come on, we're gonna be late to pick up Lexi.
Oh, a double date. That sounds good.
♪You caught his eye, surf girl♪
♪I wonder why, surf girl♪
♪You won't try, surf girl♪
♪To see him♪
♪He's high and dry, surf girl♪
♪It makes me cry, surf girl♪
♪Just please reply, surf girl♪
♪With "Yes"♪
♪To him♪
Thank you, thank you.
So?
I told you.
Going out with me is not a good idea.
Give me one reason why not.
Among other things, I just don't have the time.
Well, what if I... found you the time?
That makes even less sense than the song you just made up.
Well, you didn't answer the question.
Thanks for coming over.
Of course.
You sounded upset on the phone,
so what's going on?
I read the bill.
Okay.
And it's totally pro-privatization.
No. I mean, well, that's part of it, sure,
but it's a comprehensive...
No, no, please don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
You know how I feel about privatized homes.
My friend Kiara was almost killed in one of these places.
Callie, I don't mean to talk down to you,
but I would appreciate a chance to explain.
I think I've earned that right, don't you?
After all I've done to help you?
As part... of more comprehensive reform,
privatization is incredibly effective.
By taking the money out of the hands of bureaucrats,
and spending it directly on the kids who need help
and the families who are helping them,
we can get so much more done.
All the money isn't going to the kids.
The companies doing the placement are making a profit.
Well, why shouldn't they make a profit when they're providing
a superior service and taking big risks to do it?
Think about it. When something bad happens in a privatized home,
who's responsible? The company, the CEO.
Right now, if something goes wrong,
everyone in the system just passes the buck,
and nothing ever changes.
This all just blows up the system.
Yeah, because it needs to be blown up.
All right, think about it.
Your school, Anchor Beach... it's a charter school, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, so they're taking government money
out of the system, and they're using it to create a better,
more responsive, more creative education for you, right?
Yeah, well, then that's what we're doing with Foster Care.
Doesn't that make sense?
So, Lexi, what's it like being class president?
I mean, you're the most popular girl in school now, right?
Oh. Not really.
But it's cool.
It's a lot of work, but...
I kind of love it.
Well, I bet you're really good at it.
I mean, I can't think of
anyone who could do a better job than you.
I mean, can you, Mariana?
No, she's... she's pretty awesome.
Let's go see what's on the jukebox.
After you.
Please.
I'm sorry. Jesus said this was your favorite place.
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh god.
I think it's called "payback."
Yeah.
So, what's your deal? Are you even happy to be out with me
or is this just some master plan to annoy your sister?
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.
I...
I'm sorry.
Okay, I am stoked to be out with you. Really.
You sure?
I promise.
Orders are up.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Here you go. Enjoy.
You're not... really gonna eat that, are you?
What, my monster burger? Please, woman.
I had my first one when I was six.
No way.
For real?
I wanted to order it, but my dad said if I did,
I had to eat the whole thing, so...
So you did? You were six.
Yeah.
I threw up a couple of times.
My dad told me we weren't leaving
until I finished the last bite, so...
Maybe I shouldn't say this,
but that kinda makes your dad sound like a jerk.
You don't know the half of it.
So, I was talking to Ty's lawyer
about his hearing tomorrow.
And it turns out that he's not
just being charged with hit-and-run, but...
he's also being charged with grand theft auto.
Well, the truck belonged to Joe's father.
I mean, unless Joe got his permission,
Ty technically stole the car.
Come on, Stef.
We all know that Ty needs to face charges for the crimes he did,
but not for the crimes he didn't.
He's looking at up to five years.
Okay. What do you expect me to do, Mike?
Well, I was hoping you could speak on his behalf.
What?
Is that why you brought A.J. over to apologize the other day?
What?
To soften me up to advocate for Ty?
No. That was completely A.J.'s idea.
Okay, look, this might
help you understand why Ty did what he did.
If you could just... take a look at it.
Thanks.
Bye.
I don't know exactly what he's expecting me to do.
I don't have control over this.
You told me... when I first came here
you told me that I wasn't disposable.
So, why is Ty?
Callie, it's complicated.
No, it's... it's not. It's not, really.
What is this?
It's a date.
You said you'd go out with me if you had the time.
Well, you've got 15 minutes.
Come on. It's like speed dating,
and you know it's gonna
beat that granola bar you eat every night.
Right?
Well, at least they're out together.
I'm not sure Mariana's too thrilled about it,
but it makes me feel better.
Do... do you want some help?
No. I'm fine.
Good. How's it healing?
It's... you know.
It's okay. I can't feel anything below my clavicle,
Hopefully the numbness will wear off soon.
Yeah. Time will tell.
Oh, that's interesting.
What?
I had the guys down at the station track down Gabe's record,
and you're not gonna believe this.
Oh, I think I'm gonna bust.
Which is what happens when you eat half a cow.
Would you look at this guy?
Hey, easy.
What? This guy's going too slow.
What's up, good looking?
Idiot.
You're not gonna let him get away with that, are you?
Come on, man, burn this fool.
What's going on?
Nick.
He can't touch you, bro.
Oh my god! Oh my god! Stop the car!
Stop! Stop!
What are you doing?
Slow down! Slow down!
You're gonna get us killed!
Come on, baby!
Stop the car right now! Pull the car over!
Oh my god, you're gonna kill us!
You're gonna run a red light!
Nice!
You're gonna get us killed!
Stop the car or I swear to god I will never talk to you again.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Come on, we're just having a little bit of fun.
Come on.
No, we could've been in another accident.
And after all our mom is going through? You're an ass.
Hey, wait, come on. Mariana.
Yeah. And for the record...
Not fun.
What?
Come on, nobody got hurt.
Hey, look... all right, look, I'm sorry, okay?
Please, can you just get back in the car?
Screw you.
You wanna kill somebody, it ain't gonna be us.
Well, that was very tasty.
Nobody ever makes me a meal.
well, I didn't make it,
but I'm glad you liked it.
You deserve to be taken care of sometimes.
Mommy!
What are you doing here?
I've been texting you all night.
I'm working.
Yeah. No, I can see that.
Brandon, this is Eddie, my...
Mason's father.
Hey. Nice to meet you.
Your bear.
I got called into work early.
So?
So, you gotta take Mason.
Eddie, I can't just keep him behind the bar.
Why not?
You got one kid here already. You'll figure it out.
Did you have a good day? Huh? I missed you.
My... my shift's over.
I... I could watch him.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
So...
What's going on with your mom?
She had a double mastectomy.
Are you serious? Why didn't you tell me?
I think...
I guess I've just been kind of avoiding you.
It's not your fault.
When you won the election...
I mean, you weren't even here last year,
and you're still more popular than me, and I just...
whenever I hear how great you're doing,
it kind of makes me feel like a loser.
If it makes you feel any better,
student council is seriously kicking my butt.
It is so much work.
It does make me feel a little bit better.
Thank you, buddy.
I'm just gonna pick this up now. That's fine.
Oh no, no, no, no, hey, hey. Yeah, we won't play with knives.
You know what's better than a knife?
Cookies.
A spoon. You want the spoon?
Here you go. Don't put that in your mouth. It was on the floor.
Here you go. Spoons are much better than knives.
Down!
You don't want... you should try...
This spoon's really fun.
It's better than the knife. It's better than the knife.
Mommy!
Hey, wait, wait.
Hey, bud!
It hasn't all been this bad. I promise.
No, you did great.
Oh. Here's your spoon.
Thanks.
Well, they're letting me off early, so...
I have to cut things, and knife... cut knives, and cut things.
I'm gonna get him home.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
There's a big old fire.
There you go.
Thanks.
Do you wanna say bye to Brandon? Say, "Bye, Brandon."
Bye, Mason.
Bye, Brandon.
Bye, Brandon.
Thank you.
Bye.
Wait!
Hold on a sec.
Oh! Oh god.
Forgot his...
Oh my god, thank you.
He can't sleep without it.
You just saved my life.
Brandon.
This is a bad idea.
I've got lots of those.
Mason, look who you forgot.
The defendant, Mr. Hensdale,
Is charged with felony hit-and-run,
reckless driving, driving without insurance,
and grand theft auto.
Are you ready to enter a plea?
We are, your honor.
We plead guilty to all charges.
In that case, we will move on to sentencing.
Can I help you?
Yes, your honor. I am Ms. Stefanie Adams Foster.
I am a parent of the youths involved in the crash.
I would like to offer a victim impact statement if I may, please.
Approach.
Thank you.
Your honor, as the victims' mother,
I certainly would like to see justice done,
but as an officer investigating the case,
I feel that I also must tell you that I am confident
that Tyrone Hensdale did not steal the truck that he was driving.
Mr. Olson claimed otherwise.
Joe Olson is afraid that
he will be charged with obstructing justice.
Your honor, I brought along with me my case notes
in the hope that you would consider them before sentencing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Your honor, I do not feel that this was a malicious crime.
I believe that these were the actions of a frightened young man.
If I had had the experiences that he had with the justice system,
quite frankly, I would be frightened too.
Mr. Hensdale first entered into juvie
when he was arrested at the age of 11
for throwing a rock into an abandoned building.
At the age of 14, he was arrested for loitering.
At 15, it was petty theft. The list goes on from there.
Tyrone Hensdale has just never really been given a fair shake.
While I am not prepared to say that I forgive him,
I most certainly do understand why he did what he did.
That is why I am asking the court for lenience.
All right, tell her.
Well, we got all the plants and materials donated...
thanks to Monte.
Why... why thanks to Monte?
Because she came with me.
Those guys at the garden store had no chance
once she started working her magic on them.
So, are we good?
Can this be my thesis?
I don't see why not.
Okay. I'm off to class.
Thank you so much for everything. It's gonna be great.
What's the problem now?
Are you gonna dig the holes for her too?
This is totally inappropriate.
Encouraging a promising student?
Expanding our community outreach?
No. Involving yourself in a student's thesis.
Sally can't be perceived as getting special treatment, Monte.
There are rules th...
Yes, of course there are.
But sometimes, for the greater good, we bend them a little.
You didn't seem to mind when I bent them to
get your son back in school.
Excuse me, I've got a conference call.
I've conferred with the DA, who has agreed to remove
the charges of grand theft auto against Mr. Hensdale.
However, in light of the defendant's previous record,
I cannot let these additional offenses go unpunished.
I order the defendant, Tyrone Hensdale,
remanded into custody for a period of 18 months.
Hey, I'm gonna be fine.
I'll be out before you know it.
Until then, you've got Mike, right?
He's... he's gonna take care of you.
Be good, okay?
Well, it's better than five years.
It still kinda sucks.
Thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it.
No, thank Callie. She's the one that got me here.
Sorry I'm late,
but the hearing took longer than I thought.
How'd it go?
He got 18 months.
Ouch.
Yeah.
Did you get to talk to Justina about the bill? What'd she say?
I did. She explained it to me,
and I think...
I gotta say, I think it makes sense.
So, you're gonna support it?
That's too bad.
What does that mean?
Well, I just don't like
seeing kids being sold to the highest bidder.
No, that's... that's not what this is, Rita.
Okay, so the system is broken, right? We can agree on that?
So, privatization is a way for us to change things up.
Yeah, a really dangerous way.
I don't know why you think it's so bad.
Okay, so something goes wrong in a privatized home,
who gets the blame? The CEO.
That's a good thing. It means that
somebody's finally gonna be held accountable.
Are these your words or Justina's?
I mean, are you thinking these thoughts
or just swallowing whatever she feeds you?
How come whenever I disagree with something,
everybody jumps all over me?
Yeah, too bad. I'm sorry you don't get it.
I don't get it?
Callie, I've been working in the system for over 30 years.
And let's be honest, Rita... you have your own agenda.
And what agenda is that, Callie?
Taking care of kids?
No, keeping things the same to protect your job.
Wow. That's what you think of me?
I think change is hard for people,
especially when they can't see the big picture.
Say hello to the president for me.
Hey, guys.
Hey, what... what are you doing here?
Why don't you guys sit down, join us?
We've asked Ana to come
and talk to you guys about your birth dad.
Look, I don't really wanna...
Jesus, I think this is something you're gonna wanna hear,
so why don't you have a seat?
So, your moms told me
you found out Gabe was on the sex offender registry...
which was news to me.
The reason he's on that list, it's not because he was...
He's on that list because of me.
I... I was 15 when I met Gabe.
He was 18. When my parents found out about us...
Well, let's just say they didn't approve,
because he was older
and because they found out he sold drugs.
So, they forbid me from seeing him,
and then, of course, I ran away to be with him.
They called the police, they busted down his door,
and they arrested him for possession.
He mostly just sold pot.
Well, not that that's okay, but...
because I was underage,
they also charged him with unlawful sex with a minor,
and that got him labeled a sex offender and put on that list,
which I never knew...
until now.
So, why do you always tell us he was a one-night-stand?
I guess...
I didn't want you to think you came from a junkie
and... a drug dealer.
I didn't want that to be your story.
Hey. What's going on?
What do you mean?
Since when do you turn away to change your clothes?
I guess I just...
I don't wanna make you feel uncomfortable.
Okay. Why would I feel uncomfortable?
'Cause of everything you've been through.
If I'm being honest...
I feel a little guilty.
Guilty... that my body is still intact.
I just don't want to make you feel worse.
You're afraid I'm gonna feel... jealous?
No.
Sorry. It's really stupid.
It's not, honey. No, it's okay.
I'm okay.
I am.
Come sit here.
I am starting to get...
some feeling back, right, there you are.
I can feel you right there.
For the record, you're not what makes me feel worse.
You're what makes me feel better. Okay?
I just hope she can forgive me for missing her funeral.
You did it to be with Ty.
I think she'd understand.
Do you forgive me for telling Stef?
There's nothing to forgive, Callie.
You're not mad at me?
Then why wouldn't you see me when I came to juvie?
I was embarrassed.
Ashamed, you know, but not mad.
We were just getting somewhere, then I go and take off.
I kind of figured I blew it.
I guess not.
Look, I want to apologize for what I said.
I... I was wrong.
I didn't know you, but I do now.
You don't have to do this.
Come on, man, I'm trying to talk to you.
Look...
I don't know what you're looking for,
but you're not gonna find it with me, all right?
I'm not your father, and I never will be.
