girls in my magazines are a lot nakeder .
oh , hey , joey .
hey .
listen , i need to ask you something .
you know how my stepdad &apos;s in prison ?
yeah .
yeah .
he was supposed to get a weekend furlough so he could go to the wedding .
but he just called and ..
well , apparently stabbing lceman in the exercise yard couldn &apos;t wait till monday .
so he can &apos;t come ?
no .
and so there &apos;s no one to walk me down the aisle . and ..
well , i would just really love it if you would do it .
seriously ?
yeah .
you &apos;ve , you know , sort of been like a dad to me .
you &apos;ve always , you know , looked out for me and shared your wisdom .
i am pretty &quot; wisdomous . &quot;
so , what do you say ?
are you kidding ? phoebe , i would be honored .
oh , thank you .
i hope ..
i hope you know how much you mean to me .
listen , i hope ..
i hope that you know ..
i don &apos;t want you to see your father cry . go to your room !
the.one.with.phoebe &apos;s.wedding
oh , no , no , no . let your dad get this .
it &apos;s my wedding planner . she &apos;s driving me crazy !
hello ? okay , stop screaming !
okay , so halibut .
all right , so salmon . either way . i don &apos;t ..
it doesn &apos;t matter to me .
well , it matters to me !
well , i don &apos;t care . so you pick .
did you just hang up on me ?
all right , look , i need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours .
okay . what time is that ?
you don &apos;t know military time ?
i must have been in missile training the day they taught that .
just subtract 12 .
okay , so 1800 minus 12 ..
is 1788 .
six o &apos;clock !
okay .
hold on . yeah ? geller here .
no , i said it has to be there by 4 : 00 . goodbye .
how hard is it to make an ice sculpture ?
harder than it looks .
wait . ice sculpture ? that sounds really fancy .
i told you , i just want a simple wedding .
please , honey , leave the details to me .
now , i wanna make this day as special for you as i can .
i was thinking the harpist should wear white .
harpist ? my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums .
oh , she backed out .
she did ? why ?
i made her .
steel drums don &apos;t really say &quot; elegant wedding . &quot;
nor does marjorie &apos;s overwhelming scent .
hey !
she will shower when tibet is free .
hey . you look great .
you too .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re having a rehearsal dinner . i rarely practice my meals before i eat .
what did we say was your one gift to us ?
no stupid jokes , but i thought that was for the actual wedding .
rehearse it .
hi .
thanks for coming , you guys .
oh , yeah ..
i was .. i was going for a handshake .
that why your hand &apos;s against my crotch ?
that is why .
yeah .
so , rach , where &apos;s emma ?
monica made me send her to my mom &apos;s .
apparently , babies and weddings don &apos;t mix .
are you still crying about your damn baby ?
phoebe , you got to keep the line moving . remember , 20 seconds per person .
you see these clowns all the time .
you must give me the name of your wedding planner .
i wanna throw a really tense party .
hey , you &apos;re mike &apos;s parents , right ?
yes , we are .
our little ones are growing up fast , aren &apos;t they ?
how &apos;s that ?
you know ..
on one hand , you &apos;re happy for them . on the other , it &apos;s hard to let go .
how do you want to divide up the holidays ?
i was thinking thanksgiving at my place , christmas at yours .
who in god &apos;s name are you ?
i &apos;m not that fond of you either , buddy . i &apos;m just trying to be nice for the kids .
you know what ? we have no idea what we &apos;re doing in the wedding tomorrow .
i thought we &apos;d be groomsmen . they would have asked us by now .
when did they ask you to be a bridesmaid ?
november .
i wanna say it &apos;s not looking good .
hey , phoebe ?
sorry ?
you haven &apos;t told these guys what they &apos;re doing in the wedding yet .
well , they &apos;re not in the wedding .
what ?
well ..
this is really awkward .
oh , and i can leave .
i &apos;m sorry , you guys . but mike &apos;s got his brother and his friends from school .
so , you know , you were ..
if it helps , you were next in line . you just missed the cut .
oh , man .
this is like figure skating team all over again .
i mean , synchronized swimming .
i mean .. i mean , the balance beam .
help me .
football .
thank you .
oh , phoebe , spit that out . that has pork in it .
i thought the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian ?
yeah , i changed them . i sent you a fax about it .
i don &apos;t have a fax machine .
well , then there are gonna be a few surprises .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re gonna be the only people not in the wedding .
i know . i hate being left out of things .
and it &apos;s a wedding .
it &apos;ll be weird if i &apos;m not in it .
hey , guys , how &apos;s it going ?
fine .
we &apos;re sitting here , alone , doing nothing . it &apos;s our rehearsal for tomorrow .
look , about tomorrow , i &apos;ve got a question for you .
i found out one of my groomsmen had an emergency and can &apos;t make it .
what happened ?
who cares ? and .. ?
and i was wondering if one of you guys ..
i &apos;ll do it !
me !
you both wanna do it ? there &apos;s only room for one .
pick me . i look great in a tux , and i won &apos;t steal focus .
no , mike . no , no , you wanna pick me . i mean .. watch .
you know , i really don &apos;t feel very comfortable making this decision .
you know , phoebe knows you better . i &apos;m gonna let her choose .
well , if phoebe &apos;s choosing , then say hello to mike &apos;s next groomsman .
oh , i will . but i will need a mirror ..
as he is me .
please . you &apos;re going down .
you are going &quot; downer . &quot;
they say that on the figure skating team ?
i wouldn &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t make it .
you know i &apos;m filling in for phoebe &apos;s stepdad tomorrow , right ?
yeah . yeah . hey , thanks for doing that .
oh , hey , my pleasure .
so , what are your intentions with my phoebe ?
i intend to marry her .
oh , a wiseacre .
i understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano ?
isn &apos;t that kind of unstable ?
no more so than acting .
strike two .
you &apos;re right . she probably will support me .
hey , unless we move in with you , dad .
strike three .
you only get one more , mike .
michael , can i see you for a moment ?
yeah , sure .
this was ..
weird .
hi .
hey .
what &apos;s with the face ?
that mike has got no respect . i &apos;m not sure about him .
wait , that &apos;s not him . there he is .
so ? what did you decide ?
i decided to pee .
you have to choose one of us to be in your wedding .
one of the groomsmen fell out .
oh , no , no .
i can &apos;t choose between you two . i love you both so much .
just not enough to put us in the original wedding party .
such bitterness .
best to keep that attitude in the seats .
come on , phoebe . we both really want to do this , and it &apos;s up to you .
but i don &apos;t wanna choose . it &apos;s ..
okay , wait . rach ?
listen , i have a very special bridesmaid task for you to do .
goody ! what is it ?
well , there &apos;s a spot open for only one groomsman ..
and you have to choose between ross and chandler . so good luck with that .
what ? what , what , what ? no , i don &apos;t wanna do that .
i guess i have to find a new bridesmaid .
i &apos;ll do it !
okay , it &apos;s 2100 hours .
time for your toast .
do i have time to go to the bathroom ?
you had a bathroom break at 2030 . pee on your own time , mike .
in regards to the toasts , okay , you wanna keep them short .
nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches . okay .
you just get in , do your thing , and get out .
is that what you say to chandler ?
it &apos;s 2101 , and i am not amused .
okay .
the bride and groom have a few words they &apos;d like to say .
okay . hello , everyone .
and thank you all for being here tonight . so tomorrow &apos;s the big event .
some of you might not know , but mike and i didn &apos;t get off to the best start .
yeah . my friend joey and i ..
decided to fix each other up with friends . so i ..
oh , okay . i ..
i thought about it , and i fixed him up with my friend mary ellen ..
who couldn &apos;t be here tonight , because .. it &apos;s not ..
it &apos;s not important . well , she &apos;s in rehab .
anyway . so joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend mike ..
only he didn &apos;t have a friend mike , so he just brought my mike .
and .. and ..
but despite , you know .. it got good .
i wanna take a moment to mention my mother , who couldn &apos;t be here .
oh , god .
and .. and moment &apos;s over .
so okay .. oh , no , forget that .
i can forget that . oh , this is funny .
oh , but you need to know that to get that .
so .. oh , well , okay .
i .. okay .
okay , monica , i can &apos;t do it like this !
this is my wedding , okay ? i don &apos;t want this ..
or this .. or this ..
okay ? i just wanted a simple wedding ..
where my fiance can go to the bathroom any time he wants !
you know what ? you &apos;re done .
what ?
you &apos;re fired !
cheers .
hey .
happy wedding day .
happy my wedding day to you .
joey , listen , this is gonna be bridesmaid central , all right ?
we &apos;re gonna have hair and makeup in the bathroom .
i had to move a couple things in the fridge to make room for the corsages .
man ! i wouldn &apos;t have had breakfast if i knew there was gonna be corsages .
hi .
about last night ..
i know you &apos;re under a lot of stress , and ..
well , even though the things you said were a little hurtful to me ..
as someone who &apos;s never been fired before ..
what about in high school ..
when that yogurt store let you go for sampling toppings ?
everyone there did that .
yeah , but did everybody owe 3 grand at the end of the summer ?
my point is ..
well , i &apos;m willing to take my job back .
oh , well , that &apos;s okay .
i think you and i will do much better if you &apos;re just here as a bridesmaid .
is that so ?
okay .
if that &apos;s really what you want , then here .
i give you the headset . i don &apos;t really wanna give you the headset .
i guess if you &apos;re taking over , then you should probably return these messages .
this is a lot .
but i &apos;m sure you can handle this . i have won awards ..
for my organizational skills . but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll do fine .
you &apos;ve won awards ?
i printed them out on my computer .
hey .
hi .
where &apos;s rach ?
she &apos;s in her room . why ?
i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation .
i &apos;m not gonna watch chandler up there while i &apos;m in the seats like some chump .
this wedding isn &apos;t about you .
it &apos;s not ? then who &apos;s it about ?
well , it used to be about me , but now i have no idea .
my god , you &apos;re breathtaking .
what do you want ?
you haven &apos;t by any chance chosen a groomsman yet , have you ?
ross , please don &apos;t make this harder than it already is .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m making it easier . pick me .
chandler said it &apos;s important to him too .
i &apos;m sorry , did you and chandler go out ?
do you and chandler have a huge history , huh ?
do you and chandler have a child together ?
if i said yes that would freak you out , wouldn &apos;t it ?
listen . listen .
whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you .
now , i promise i won &apos;t say a word . but if you pick chandler ..
he &apos;s gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time .
oh , you are the lesser of two evils .
yes !
don &apos;t say anything to chandler until i talk to him .
you got it .
okay .
i cannot believe you played the emma card .
oh , please . i was prepared to offer you my body .
oh , my god ! and i didn &apos;t hold out .
you know , normally , that would hurt my feelings ..
but today , i &apos;m a groomsman .
sven , i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying . what is wrong with the flowers ?
&quot; lorkins &quot; ? what the hell are &quot; lorkins &quot; ?
i know .
hey .
mike , if you were swedish ..
and you were saying the word &quot; lorkins , &quot; what flower would that be ?
orchids ?
right there !
that &apos;s why i &apos;m marrying you .
hello , michael .
joseph .
may i have a word with you , please ?
you wanna step it up there ?
this is ..
great .
have a seat .
last night ..
i tried to welcome you into my family .
and instead , you disrespect me .
i cannot allow this .
are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie ?
more back talk .
and yes , i may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition ..
for family honor 2 : this a @-@ time it &apos;s a @-@ personal .
joey , i kind of have a lot to do today . what do you want ?
i want you to take this seriously !
phoebe is very , very important to me , okay ?
i wanna make sure you are gonna take care of her .
joe , i love phoebe .
she &apos;s the most important thing in my life .
i &apos;d die before i let anything happen to her .
that &apos;s what i wanted to hear .
because she &apos;s family , okay ?
and now you &apos;re gonna be family .
and there &apos;s nothing more important in the whole world than family .
that must have been one lousy movie .
that was me !
hi .
let &apos;s talk about this groomsman thing .
if you pick ross , he &apos;ll walk you down the aisle just fine .
but if you choose me ..
you &apos;ll be getting some comedy .
even so ..
i think i &apos;m gonna pick ross .
yeah , i figured you might ..
because of the history , and you used to love him ..
and you guys have a baby .
well , thank you for respecting my decision .
let me tell you why you need to pick me .
see , when i was a kid , you know , i was always left out of everything ..
and it really made me feel insecure .
i was always picked last in gym ..
even behind that fat exchange student who didn &apos;t know the rules to baseball .
i mean , this guy would strike out and then run to third .
it &apos;s just so humiliating .
i mean , you know how it feels to be left out of things , right ?
no .
no .
anyway , if i &apos;m the only one left out of this wedding ..
i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back .
all right , fine , i pick you .
yes !
make &quot; groom &quot; for chandler .
oh , my .
no , we &apos;re gonna do it my way . because your way is stupid .
all right , i got to go . i have another call , reverend .
hello ?
i &apos;m glad we had this little talk .
yes .
and thanks for all the wedding night advice .
that didn &apos;t make me uncomfortable at all .
all right , so i &apos;ll see everybody tonight .
okay .
bye .
did you guys know that there &apos;s a giant ice sculpture in the hall ?
oh , my god , what &apos;s it doing here ?
i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address .
what a pickle .
oh , my god , everything &apos;s such a mess .
why is this happening to me ?
how bad do you wanna stick your tongue on that ?
how &apos;s it going ?
good .
i &apos;m just getting some coffee so i &apos;m alert for the wedding .
that &apos;s what i was doing too .
well , you have fun tonight .
you too .
oh , i will .
me too .
wait a minute . i know why i &apos;m being such an ass . why are you ?
i &apos;m not supposed to tell you .
i &apos;m not supposed to tell you .
did rachel say you could be in the wedding ?
yes .
she told me that too !
i don &apos;t believe this . i played the emma card .
i looked into my soul .
you told us both we could be in the wedding ?
in my defense , you weren &apos;t supposed to tell each other !
rachel , only one of us can do it . you have to choose .
you and me together again .
rach , rach ? knock @-@ knock .
who &apos;s there ?
i &apos;ll tell you at the wedding .
hey , i forgot my scarf .
i can &apos;t do this . i don &apos;t know which one of you guys to pick .
oh , you haven &apos;t picked yet ? oh , good , because i had an idea .
i thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog , chappy .
what ? a dog ? no . rachel gets to choose .
wow , this is a tough one .
i think i &apos;m gonna have to go with the dog .
so , what you &apos;re saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club ..
but the food is not ? and the drinks are there but the bartender is not ?
are you freaking kidding me ?
how &apos;s it going ?
help me .
what ?
i want you to be crazy bitch again .
really ?
please ?
you really want me to come back ?
more than i wanna get married .
okay , people , we are back in business !
oh , god , i have missed you so much . okay .
get your hair and makeup done . i &apos;ll take care of everything .
hey , what are you guys gonna do ?
about what ?
the blizzard . i just saw on the news ..
it &apos;s the worst snowstorm in 20 years .
they already closed all the bridges and tunnels .
but the band and the photographer are coming in from new jersey .
i don &apos;t think they are .
looks like you &apos;re not gonna be in the wedding , either .
so sorry , phoebe .
well , the club lost its power .
the news said most of the city did .
since when do you watch the news ?
for your information ..
since they hired a very hot weather girl .
i can &apos;t believe you aren &apos;t getting married today .
i know .
it &apos;s so beautiful out there . you always wanted to get married outside .
why don &apos;t you just do it on the street ?
what ?
well , look , it &apos;s hardly snowing anymore .
i mean , you couldn &apos;t ask for a more romantic setting .
this could be the simple wedding you &apos;ve always wanted .
what do you think ?
i think i wanna get married to you today .
me too . monica , do you think we could do it ?
affirmative !
okay , let &apos;s get these chairs out here !
gunther , hit the christmas lights .
okay , who left the ice sculpture on the steam grate ?
michael .
hey , you made it . great . chappy !
there you go .
hi . hi .
i know getting married in the street isn &apos;t what you approve of .
no , it &apos;s lovely . the lights and the snow . i could look at them forever .
i crushed a pill and put it in her drink .
come on , sweetheart .
you know , chappy &apos;s too small to handle all this snow .
someone has to walk him down the aisle .
would this person be in the wedding ?
i guess .
i &apos;ll do it !
i &apos;ll do it !
chandler , hello ? i mean , aren &apos;t you scared of dogs ?
i &apos;m not scared . i &apos;ll just take little chappy and ..
he can sense my fear ! my throat is exposed !
i guess i &apos;m in the wedding then .
you stinks .
level one alert ! i repeat , level one , this is not a drill !
we have a situation . the minister called . he &apos;s snowed in , he can &apos;t make it .
oh , no .
hey , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m still ordained from your wedding .
really ?
yeah . you think i &apos;d give up being a minister and pay to ride the subway ?
ministers don &apos;t ride the subway for free .
i had to read the bible pretty carefully , but , yeah , we do .
we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the aisle .
i &apos;ll do it !
okay , mike and joey , get in position .
chandler , come with me .
okay , joey &apos;s doing the ceremony , and chandler &apos;s giving you away .
oh , okay . hi , new dad .
so you ready to do this ?
oh , my god . this is really happening .
phoebe , i &apos;m so happy for you , honey .
thank you .
i love you . wait , wait ! no hugs ! the dresses !
oh , what the hell .
oh , come on .
i love you guys .
i love you .
okay , it &apos;s zero hour ! all teams execute on my count !
let &apos;s get this bad boy on the road !
is it okay i want you to wear that headset in bed ?
i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours .
oh , yeah .
okay , marjorie , hit it .
jeez , ross . you could &apos;ve showered .
it &apos;s the dog .
groomsman ? why are you standing there ? where &apos;s your bridesmaid ?
we &apos;ve got a broken arrow ! bridesmaid down !
oh , that &apos;s me .
ready ?
okay .
oh , wait . oh , no . wait .

thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event .
the cold has now spread to my special place ..
so i &apos;m gonna do the short version of this .
phoebe and mike are perfect for each other .
and i know i speak for everyone here ..
when i wish them a lifetime of happiness .
and may they have many children ..
who will one day avenge their family &apos;s honor .
how could i not get that part ? stupid ralph macchio .
right . okay .
who has the rings ?
okay .
when i was growing up , i didn &apos;t have a normal mom and dad ..
or a regular family like everybody else .
and i always knew that something was missing .
but now i &apos;m standing here today ..
knowing that i have everything i &apos;m ever gonna need .
you are my family .
phoebe , you are so beautiful .
you &apos;re so kind . you &apos;re so generous .
you &apos;re so wonderfully weird .
every day with you is an adventure .
and i can &apos;t believe how lucky i am .
and i can &apos;t wait to share my life with you forever .
oh , wait ! oh , i forgot . and ..
i love you .
and you have nice eyes .
i love you too .

chappy &apos;s heart rate has slowed way down .
okay . phoebe ..
do you take this man to be your husband ?
i do .
mike , do you take this woman to be your wife ?
i do .
i now pronounce you ..
husband and wife .
i got married !
could someone get me a coat ? i &apos;m frigging freezing .
it really was an incredible wedding .
it was .
i kind of don &apos;t want it to end . hey ..
you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage ?
i &apos;d love to , but it &apos;s 2300 hours ..
and i &apos;m about to have the most organized sex anyone &apos;s ever had .
whatever happened to ross ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he talked to .
come on , chappy ! do your business !
