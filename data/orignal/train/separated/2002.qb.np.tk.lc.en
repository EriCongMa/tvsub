when i was 11,
my parents were involved in a really horrible accident .
my grandmother took me in .
it &apos;s your grandma . she passed away .
either jessica will retain her position ,
or i will resume control of pearson hardman .
i &apos;m entitled to name one new senior partner a year .
if you are on the wrong side , there &apos;ll be no coming back .
the managing partner is daniel hardman .
jessica lost ! you lost !
you looking for another way to make my life miserable ?
zoe , i &apos;m still not convinced i should hire you .
well , harvey never tried to sleep with ted phillips .
ms. sheila zass .
i think louis is attracted to female louis .
i &apos;m tess .
you guys must go way back .
first beer , prom , sex .
your grandmother just died .
when something like that happens ,
people don &apos;t make smart choices .
you &apos;re married .
and you called me anyway .
what if hardman planted
the cm memo in the first place ?
all those in favor of daniel hardman &apos;s dismissal ?
i don &apos;t care about being smart .
fyi , we &apos;re out of pizza .
you &apos;re telling me this now ?
i didn &apos;t know you were gonna get high .
you mean you didn &apos;t know we were gonna get high .
oh , does this mean you &apos;re not going back to work tomorrow ?
no , it means i &apos;m celebrating going back to work tomorrow .
fine .
but don &apos;t think i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re really doing .
what , getting you high ,
so i can get into your pants
or under your sheet or whatever ?
i meant you &apos;re afraid .
afraid ? nope .
i &apos;m not afraid , i can &apos;t wait to get back .
you can &apos;t wait to get back to talk to rachel ?
i am not afraid to talk to rachel .
and i &apos;m not afraid of the big , bad wolf .
look , i told you , she &apos;s a friend .
she was just coming to check up on me , that &apos;s all .
and i told you i believed you .
you &apos;re welcome .
so why can &apos;t you just keep pretending you believe me now ?
because you have to go back to work tomorrow .
and your husband gets back in town tomorrow .
you want more pizza ?
let &apos;s order more pizza .
yeah .
great .
somebody give you a promotion ?
somebody should .
lopez buyout delayed , phillips merger closed .
oh , and zoe lawford called , which is odd ,
because i don &apos;t remember us having a trial
we needed consulting services on .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re sitting at my desk .
i wanted to be in a position of power when i toyed with you .
let &apos;s get one thing clear .
i &apos;m not charlie brown ,
又在查理踢球前把球抽走
you &apos;re not lucy , and that &apos;s not a football .
let &apos;s get two things clear .
i don &apos;t remember ever placing a call to zoe ,
but her message said she was calling back .
i called her . for business .
what kind of business ? a merger ?
okay , what are you , 12 years old ?
i &apos;m not the one robbing the cradle here .
i &apos;m not robbing anything .
zoe and i are the same age .
so you admit it .
you called to ask her on a date .
behind my back .
it wasn &apos;t behind your back .
you &apos;d gone home already .
because you waited for me to go home .
like i said , it was behind your back .
harvey , just out of curiosity ,
what took you so long to call her ?
i had my hands full with hardman .
well , now you &apos;re hands full of her .
look , now it &apos;s over , i want to celebrate .
and she &apos;s the person i want to do it with .
are you gonna tell her that ?
i assume you heard that the lopez buyout was delayed ?
so i &apos;m gonna need some--
louis , i don &apos;t give a shit what you need .
all right , harvey , you know what ?
look , it &apos;s been a week .
you won , you know , get over it .
get out .
you know , for your information ,
i wasn &apos;t the only senior partner who voted for hardman .
and i don &apos;t see you giving anyone else shit the way you give me .
and by the way , when the chips were down ,
i backed you , i ousted him .
you mean when you did this ?
tell yourself whatever you want , louis ,
but tell it to yourself .
you here to rip the band @-@ aid off ?
it &apos;s what grammy always said to do when you have a boo @-@ boo .
really ?
you &apos;re gonna use her to get out of this ?
look , rachel , i understand that you &apos;re mad at me .
no , i &apos;m not .
what &apos;s that expression ?
&quot; fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice-- &quot;
nobody &apos;s fooling anybody .
i &apos;m sorry .
sorry for what ?
for what i saw or what you did ?
rachel , come on .
i &apos;m just trying to--
let me just ask you this .
does she know that six hours before you screwed her ,
you tried to screw me ?
okay , let &apos;s not pretend that this is about her , okay ?
so she knows , or she doesn &apos;t ?
i mean , is it fair to her
that she was your second choice that night ?
because if i were her , mike--
she &apos;s married .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s really worried
about being my second choice .
welcome back .
who &apos;s ready for a great first day ?
harvey , can you give us a minute , please ?
i can &apos;t . we actually have a crisis . we gotta go .
you once told me you could fix anything , harvey .
this is my son , liam .
your mother says you have a problem .
um , i was driving home from greenwich last night .
a friend &apos;s party .
i hit someone .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t see him .
he came out of nowhere .
were you drunk ?
don &apos;t answer that .
if this comes to trial , i can &apos;t put him on the stand .
but i wasn &apos;t drinking .
and if we asked everybody else at the party ,
would they tell the same story ?
if it comes out , we need to know .
talk to anyone who was there .
what if i checked your car for beer bottles right now ?
go ahead . check anything you want .
i &apos;m telling the truth .
okay , it was an accident . we can deal with this .
tell me , what happened to the guy you hit ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s why we called you .
what do you mean ?
he drove away .
i know exactly what you &apos;re gonna say .
we have to find out what happened to the guy he hit .
so i &apos;m gonna call all the hospitals ...
i think you need to sit this one out .
look , i know i jumped the gun ,
but one wrong question and i &apos;m out ?
you weren &apos;t jumping the gun , it set you off .
harvey , i &apos;m fine .
look , i &apos;m not blaming you , i &apos;m understanding you .
your parents were killed by a drunk driver .
and liam said he wasn &apos;t drunk .
doesn &apos;t matter .
your emotions get the better of you on a merger .
gillian &apos;s a longtime client .
it &apos;s her only son , i can &apos;t have that .
i can do this .
your grandmother just died .
i said i &apos;m onboard .
i &apos;m onboard .
so what do you think ?
the damage helps us . it &apos;s minimal .
more importantly , if the impact was central ,
guy would have been directly in your field of vision ,
so this backs the story up . he came out of nowhere .
albert chung was rushed to the e.r. last night ,
after a 911 call .
you called 911 ?
yeah .
you should have told us that .
he has a concussion , contusions , four cracked ribs ,
but he &apos;s stable .
thank god , so it &apos;s okay .
gillian , liam needs to turn himself in .
it was an accident .
exactly , so if he comes forward ,
he &apos;s a 20 @-@ year @-@ old kid who freaked out ,
but now he &apos;s doing the right thing .
harvey &apos;s right .
if they come to us , which i know they will ,
we &apos;ll be on the defensive , we &apos;ll never recover .
shit .
you can &apos;t know that .
they might never find him .
you really want to risk your son &apos;s life on that ?
i &apos;m sorry , but isn &apos;t this liam &apos;s decision ?
what &apos;s gonna happen to me ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if you &apos;re worried about prison movies ,
that &apos;s not what &apos;s gonna happen .
how do you know that ?
because i know harvey .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
hey , believe it or not ,
i &apos;ve been where you are right now .
what ?
yeah . i was 16 .
got busted for possession , 1 / 2 ounce .
i was so scared .
you smoke ?
i did .
i do .
but you didn &apos;t hurt anybody .
i know it feels like there &apos;s no way out .
but i &apos;m telling you ,
you &apos;re going to be home in time for dinner .
i must say , i &apos;m so glad you called .
i &apos;m so glad you answered .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re glad .
when were you gonna tell me about your promotion ?
you know about my promotion ?
senior partnerships rocket to my ears
with the speed of a late @-@ night bullet .
really ?
i read it on twitter .
from the moment i laid eyes on you ,
i could tell you were a baller .
oh , i ball , which is why i called you .
one of the perks of my new title--
say it .
senior partner .
go on .
i get to hire an associate of my own .
a boy wonder to my batman .
well , i am with you , dark knight .
i want you to send me the best of the best .
i &apos;ve already lined up interviews
with my top five recent graduates .
have you ?
figure of speech .
but , i have to say , i was hoping you didn &apos;t call
exclusively for business .
i was hoping you were hoping that .
i &apos;m gonna be honest with you , louis .
senior partner has a certain sex appeal .
junior partner doesn &apos;t .
i thought that to myself about myself .
room 405 . 9 : 00 pm , tomorrow .
bring coconut oil , a ski mask , and duct tape .
fear never felt so good .
katrina bennett .
harvey specter .
nice to meet you .
your record is something of a legend around here .
excellent .
i hope we can extend each other some professional courtesy .
i &apos;m not extending you anything .
of course .
what better thing to do than to take down a legend ?
well , i &apos;m glad we understand each other .
we do , but here &apos;s the problem .
this isn &apos;t the case for it .
it &apos;s a misdemeanor , leaving the scene ,
and now he &apos;s turned himself in .
because you knew we &apos;d trace the 911 call .
that &apos;s not why . he feels terrible .
he feels afraid .
not the same thing .
katrina , i understand you want to take me out ,
but this is an accident .
liam made a mistake , and he &apos;s rectifying it .
we &apos;ll accept maximum community service
and whatever fine you deem appropriate .
and what about funeral costs ?
wait . what ?
he died ?
which makes it felony hit @-@ and @-@ run .
he was stable .
his concussion led to a brain bleed .
that man &apos;s death doesn &apos;t change the fact
that it was an accident .
felony hit @-@ and @-@ run , under these circumstances ,
is 12 to 15 years .
you wanted courtesy ? here it is .
i &apos;ll go ten .
that &apos;s crazy . it was dark .
he wasn &apos;t drinking .
tell me it &apos;s not what you would have offered .
maria monroe .
secretary of your class at harvard law .
clerked for chief justice roberts .
glowing letters of recommendation .
you think this impresses me ?
negative .
which means you have exactly five minutes
to convince me that you &apos;re the one .
i don &apos;t need five minutes . i am the one .
it &apos;s you who &apos;s on the clock , louis .
i have standing offers from the top three firms in the city .
pearson hardman is a top @-@ three firm .
well , i used to think so .
but if it &apos;s taking you this long to meet with me ,
maybe you &apos;re slipping .
oh , no , i &apos;m not-- we &apos;re not slipping .
you need to submit a formal offer by noon tomorrow
if you want me to even consider working here .
wh-- maria , hold on a second .
just wait right there , wait right there .
you four , beat it . position has been filled .
i &apos;ll beat any salary by 50 % . 25,000 signing bonus .
put it in writing .
w @-@ w @-@ wait--
don &apos;t you want me to give you a tour of the firm ?
show you where you &apos;ll be working ?
well , i don &apos;t care where i &apos;d be working
because i &apos;m a machine .
i have to have you .
that &apos;s what they all say .
police report , photos of the intersection ,
coroner &apos;s report .
this isn &apos;t sixth @-@ grade math .
don &apos;t show me your work , just give me the answer .
god , i wish i had you in the sixth grade .
except , no-- miss jenson , very hot .
you need a minute alone ?
there was a reason that liam did not see albert chung .
he was wearing a hooded sweatshirt , jeans , and sneakers .
all black .
guy couldn &apos;t have been harder to see if he was trying .
maybe he was trying .
albert chung was an art school dropout .
look at that graffiti on the wall .
&quot; a.c. &quot; albert chung .
he was trying to be invisible
because he was tagging that building .
and he was running away when he got hit .
which means liam didn &apos;t cause the accident ,
albert chung did .
i think you missed your calling as a fake cop .
going back to that well again ? okay .
so what are you gonna do ? stick it to katrina ?
no , you &apos;re gonna stick it to katrina .
you heard her .
her agenda isn &apos;t just prosecuting liam ,
it &apos;s beating me .
see , i &apos;m taking the personal out of it .
your problem is , you put the personal into it .
okay , i thought my problem
was showing you my work unnecessarily .
who said there &apos;s only one problem ?
well @-@ played .
felony hit @-@ and @-@ run hinges
on a lack of contributory negligence .
albert chung was fleeing a crime scene .
he put himself in harm &apos;s way .
so your client can &apos;t be held responsible ?
we &apos;ll plead to misdemeanor leaving the scene ,
but that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m going to do you a favor and take this deal .
you &apos;re not doing me a favor , you &apos;re doing yourself a favor .
we &apos;ve got you .
got me or not , it &apos;s no secret
the d.a. and harvey had a run @-@ in .
he finds out this is harvey &apos;s case ,
it goes to trial .
and anything can happen at trial ,
so let me be clear ,
i am doing you a favor .
what do you want ?
to make the same career jump harvey did .
to corporate litigation ?
to pearson hardman .
wait , i thought you--
that i wanted to kick harvey &apos;s ass ?
i said that because you don &apos;t impress
a lawyer like harvey with flowers .
look , this is a fair plea .
and it &apos;s one that should go through .
i &apos;ll make sure that it does .
and if you were to put a word in with harvey ,
i would appreciate it .
you got to be kidding me .
she actually said that ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know if i settled a case or agreed to a bribe .
did she sign the plea offer ?
yeah .
then , &quot; a , &quot; because she can &apos;t rescind that thing
unless new evidence comes to light ,
and i don &apos;t have to interview her for shit .
good .
yeah , good .
i don &apos;t want to hire another associate ever again .
the one i picked causes me enough headaches .
oh , right , like winning cases ?
graffiti , man in black-- is that ringing any bells ?
it does indeed ,
which leads us to our next assignment ,
should you choose to accept it .
please tell me you &apos;re about to self @-@ destruct .
we need to settle with the chung family .
harvey , their son just died .
i know , and i also know that grief comes in stages ,
and the best time to settle is before it gets to anger .
you mean the best time to take advantage of them
is before it gets to anger .
that &apos;s not--
our concern ?
i know we got liam out of prison ,
but he still hit a guy , and that guy is still dead .
and we still represent liam .
harvey ...
i know it &apos;s not the same situation , but ...
i remember the day the lawyer came to our place .
nick rinaldi . i ...
i remember his dirty shoes . i ...
i remember how they scraped the floor
when he walked into the living room
to tell my grandmother
how much my parents &apos; lives were worth .
i &apos;ve been where these people are .
let me be the one to tell them .
you sure you can handle it ?
i &apos;m sure as hell not going
to leave them to the likes of you .
okay , you can handle it .
you &apos;re authorized to go as high as $ 100,000 .
divorce is on 43 .
look , i know that you &apos;re mad at me ,
and i never meant to put you in this situation ,
but i would really appreciate it
if you kept what i told you to yourself .
let me get this straight .
you hit on me ,
then you run into the arms of some married woman .
you come waltzing into my office
trying to cutesy your way out of it .
and now you have the nerve
to think i &apos;m gonna go and tell other people ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re gonna tell other people ,
but you sure seem to have the ability
to judge everything that i do .
do you think that you have the lock on bad decisions ?
all i know is i &apos;m not little miss perfect .
i &apos;ve had an affair before too .
you see the look on your face ?
who &apos;s judging who now , mike ?
and , no , it was not some 50 @-@ year @-@ old man
trying to take advantage of poor , young me .
we were the same age , and i went after him .
i am not the goody @-@ goody you think i am .
you have no idea what you passed on .
and i &apos;ll tell you something , mike .
what you &apos;re doing , it only ends one way .
ms. chung , i just want you to know
that liam colson is devastated by this accident ,
regardless of who caused it .
thank you .
i know that there &apos;s no amount of money
that can ever make up for it ...
and that this is probably the last thing
you want to be talking about .
my brother wasn &apos;t exactly a model citizen , mr. ross .
we know he &apos;s not entitled to much .
all my parents want is to pay off albert &apos;s debts
and cover the funeral costs .
and how much would that be ?
$ 20,000 .
well , i &apos;d like to offer you $ 100,000 .
in fact , i insist on it .
where do we sign ?
right here and here .
will you stay for some tea ?
i &apos;d be honored .
9 p.m. to the second .
punctuality is the best aphrodisiac .
who are you ?
i &apos;m batman .
did you bring the accoutrement ?
oui .
i &apos;m on pins and needles .
before we begin , i need to know ...
who &apos;s your front @-@ runner ?
maria monroe . wasn &apos;t even close .
i know . there were no five best .
you were testing me ?
i wasn &apos;t about to serve up my best candidate
on a silver platter .
god , i love that .
after all , maria is very desirable .
but the thing is , i &apos;m gonna need you ...
to help me close her .
louis , come closer .
stop .
i &apos;m gonna close the shit out of maria for you .
and you &apos;re gonna close the shit out of me .
all aboard .
wait a minute , if i didn &apos;t pick her ,
we wouldn &apos;t be doing this ?
oh , i &apos;m saying no such thing .
but the nature of what we &apos;re about to do
would be radically different .
i dominated , so i get to dominate .
you get to be dominated .
yes , i do .
do you need a safe word ?
safe words are for pussies .
start with my slippers .
oh , thank you .
hello .
where are your flowers ?
my flowers ?
you go on a date , you &apos;re supposed to bring flowers .
am i ?
yes , harvey .
everyone knows that .
how many dates have you been on ?
six .
six ?
mm , sounds serious . who &apos;s the lucky guy ?
jason .
he &apos;s not a guy , he &apos;s a boy .
and he brings flowers .
well , maybe next time we can have a double date .
you that sure it &apos;s gonna go well tonight ?
olivia , why don &apos;t you go upstairs
and finish watching your show ?
is there maybe something you forgot to tell me ?
you mean about your daughter ?
see , that &apos;s funny because we never slept together .
i don &apos;t find it funny in the least ,
and by &quot; it , &quot; i mean that we never slept together .
seriously , harvey , i &apos;m really sorry about this .
olivia &apos;s my niece . my brother just dropped her off .
he didn &apos;t have anybody else .
then i guess we &apos;ll have to sit down ,
watch bugs bunny , and order a pizza .
bugs bunny ?
yeah , no one watches that anymore .
i thought apocalypse now would be a little much for her .
can i come in ?
hey . thanks for starting without me .
couldn &apos;t wait .
that bad a day ?
nope , that good of one .
so your little chat with rachel went well .
not what i meant .
i negotiated a settlement with the sister
of the man who was killed in a car accident today .
oh , my god .
no , no . it &apos;s not what you think .
i , um ,
i gave this family dignity .
and as hard as it was ...
it was the best day of work i &apos;ve ever had .
that &apos;s awesome .
hey .
liam &apos;s plea deal came through .
it &apos;s on its way to gillian &apos;s .
i need you to go over there and walk &apos; em through it ,
so we can wrap this up .
uh , i &apos;m on my way .
shit .
what ?
i have to go see a client .
mike , you &apos;re high .
what if they can tell ?
tess , i was high every day of my life for years ,
and nobody knew , okay ?
i can handle it .
she asleep ?
not exactly .
she wants you to go up there and kiss her good night .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
no , i can do that .
harvey .
afterwards , i want you to come down here ,
and kiss me good night .
so ...
i sign this , and we &apos;re done ?
yeah .
uh , the a.d.a. agreed to it ,
so you sign it , and then , um ...
and then the judge &apos;ll sign it .
and then-- then we &apos;re done .
community service and a fine .
you sound disappointed .
no , no , i appreciate it .
it &apos;s just ...
it could have been so much worse .
i thought my life over .
i &apos;m such an asshole .
hey , liam , it &apos;s okay to feel relief .
the chung family doesn &apos;t blame you .
nobody blames you .
do you remember what you said the other day
about getting high ?
why are you asking me that ?
i was high .
what ?
how could you not tell us that ?
&apos;cause harvey said not to .
but you said you weren &apos;t drunk .
you said , &quot; ask everyone . &quot;
you could have .
i was alone .
i get high all the time , and no one ever knows .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s the matter ?
you said this was a done deal .
it is , right ?
yeah .
yeah , it &apos;s a done deal .
we got a huge problem .
don &apos;t worry , mike .
i &apos;m sure &apos; nsync will tour again someday .
we can &apos;t submit this deal because it wasn &apos;t an accident .
it was a dui .
what ?
he was stoned .
this changes everything .
it changes nothing .
i misrepresented the facts to katrina .
no , you didn &apos;t ,
because you didn &apos;t know because we didn &apos;t ask .
and i didn &apos;t ask now , but he told me now .
and that &apos;s privileged , and the deal is done .
wait a minute , so you &apos;re not gonna do anything ?
i &apos;m gonna have donna messenger this to the d.a. &apos; s office .
harvey , this family thinks their son is to blame .
because he was fleeing the scene of a crime ,
which put him in harm &apos;s way .
okay , maybe .
but if i don &apos;t tell them this part ,
then i &apos;m no different than nick rinaldi .
you &apos;re already different .
what do you mean ?
i mean , they were ready to take the $ 20,000,
but you gave &apos; em $ 100,000 .
did you think i wasn &apos;t going to find out about that ?
harvey , please , come on .
you asked me to be on this case
after i warned you about something like this .
you said , &quot; i &apos;m onboard . &quot;
do you have any idea what would happen
if gillian found out what you did ?
what if she found out about her son ?
she &apos;d probably give them a bigger settlement .
but , hey , you already did that , and i let it go .
you need to let this go .
say whatever you want .
that &apos;s no different than nick rinaldi .
that &apos;s just more money and cleaner shoes .
oh , my god . you were waiting .
i heard you were here , so i rushed right out .
i formally accept your offer
of employment at pearson hardman .
oh , this is the best week ever .
i won &apos;t let you down .
i &apos;m sorry .
i have no idea what this is regarding ,
but , yes , he will . he always does .
water off a snail &apos;s back .
see what i mean ?
donna paulsen , maria monroe ,
my personal first @-@ year .
she &apos;s a machine .
and let me just tell you something ,
she &apos;s gonna run circles around mike ross .
you wait right here , and i &apos;ll get us some bundt cake .
i &apos;m sorry , mike who ?
mike ross .
is he a first @-@ year ?
why do you ask ?
i thought you only hired from harvard .
we do .
i was secretary of my class .
i knew every name .
there was no mike ross my year at harvard .
but you weren &apos;t the same year .
no , i clerked for a year .
he &apos;s a year ahead of me here ,
but he would have been in my class .
oh , well , mike clerked for three years ,
which means he wasn &apos;t in your class .
well , i look forward to meeting him .
uh ... last night .
i was , uh ...
i was driving home ,
i &apos;d had a lot to drink .
i hit someone .
and i &apos;m pretty sure that they &apos;re dead .
so , uh , i need your help .
sorry , i don &apos;t take cases like that .
you don &apos;t take cases like that ?
what about your case from 1992 ?
driver plows into a car ,
after drinking about a thousand jack and cokes ,
killing a happily married couple ?
james and nina ross ?
i &apos;m afraid i have no recollection of that .
oh , yeah ? let me ring a bell for you , then .
two days later , you walk into their living room ,
you find their little boy and his grandmother just sitting there ,
and then you stick it to them .
they hadn &apos;t even had time to hold a wake yet .
are you still gonna deny it ?
i didn &apos;t deny it .
just have no recollection of it
because i did it so many times .
i &apos;m sorry , is that supposed to move me , huh ?
am i supposed to think
that you &apos;re somehow above all that now ?
it &apos;s not supposed to do anything .
but let me point out ,
you walked in here two minutes ago ,
told me you &apos;d hit somebody , and i turned you away .
what &apos;s your name ?
like you give a shit .
okay .
what are you looking for from me ?
i wanna know how you live with yourself .
i wanna know how you wake up every morning
and not put a bullet in your brain ,
knowing what a piece of shit you are !
you might not want to hear this ,
but just because i don &apos;t remember who you are
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t regret what i did to you .
now the sad fact is that once a deal is done ,
it can &apos;t be undone .
james and nina ross .
if i ever see you again ,
you better remember who they are .
thank you .
did you know louis is hiring his own associate ?
not specifically , but he is entitled to it .
we got to stop him .
harvey , i know you &apos;re mad at louis .
so am i , but it &apos;s over .
we won , and the man has a job to do .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
we let him hire the person he just hired ,
mike &apos;s gonna be exposed .
how do you know this ?
she was secretary of his class .
and there &apos;s 600 kids in that class .
nobody knows everybody .
she says she does .
how can you be so sure ?
donna met her .
she &apos;s sure .
goddamn mike ross .
he &apos;s the gift that keeps on giving .
how many more headaches is this kid gonna cause me , harvey ?
you wanted to see me ?
did you make an offer to a maria monroe
to be a first @-@ year associate ?
yes , and let me just tell you something ,
you &apos;re gonna love her .
rescind it .
what ?
firm &apos;s been through a lot .
we have to regroup .
therefore , i &apos;m instituting a hiring freeze ,
which you would have known about
had you come and asked my permission first .
okay , you can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m a senior partner , and that &apos;s the rule .
strictly speaking , it &apos;s not a rule ,
it &apos;s a tradition .
i get it .
strictly speaking , this isn &apos;t about a hiring freeze ,
this is punishment .
you can be punitive , i can be punitive .
the offer already went out , jessica .
you &apos;re a lawyer , make it go away .
what am i gonna tell the world ?
i &apos;m gonna look like a freaking fool .
well , tell them there &apos;s a hiring freeze .
i don &apos;t care .
make it go away .
you &apos;re dismissed .
the message you left was a little cryptic .
what do you want ?
i want to help you get what you want .
and what is that ?
liam colson was driving under the influence
when he hit albert chung .
how exactly did you come to know that ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
thank you , mike .
all rise .
for the honorable judge nicholas palermo .
be seated .
&quot; state of new york versus liam colson . &quot;
i am happy to report
the state entered into a plea agreement
with the defendant last night .
you have a copy of the terms , your honor .
everything appears to be in order .
the agreement is approved .
community service starts monday .
that &apos;s it ? you &apos;re just walking away ?
as fast as i can .
because you know what &quot; i can &apos;t tell you how i know that &quot; means ?
it means you just violated privilege .
wait , so you don &apos;t care
that he was driving under the influence ?
i can &apos;t prove he was under the influence .
you don &apos;t know what you could prove
if you got that kid in a room .
if i were to use what you just told me ,
all i would be doing is making myself look like an idiot .
are you really gonna be able to sleep at night ?
are you ?
you &apos;re the one who walked in there
and tried to sell out a 20 @-@ year @-@ old kid .
he took someone &apos;s life , right ?
that someone had a mother and a father and a sister .
that family is never gonna be the same .
listen to me , you think i haven &apos;t had a case
where i could have crossed a line to put someone away ?
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised if you did ,
after that bribe you offered me .
i didn &apos;t offer you shit .
i did you a favor .
and then i asked for a favor ,
which you could do or not .
is that really what you tell yourself
when you look in the mirror ?
if you &apos;re willing to break privilege ,
you &apos;re the one who needs to look in the mirror .
katrina bennett called .
the deal &apos;s done .
get the paperwork started .
harvey , what did you do ?
i did what i had to do .
your first hire was mike .
are you sure you want this to be your second ?
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
she starts on monday .
chateauneuf @-@ du @-@ pape , 1985 .
i guess they were out of the &apos; 83 .
louis ,
you look like i just kicked you in the stomach
but in a bad way .
i &apos;m sorry .
i , my mind &apos;s on something else .
what is it ?
promise you won &apos;t be mad ?
you &apos;re not about to tell me i have to get tested , are you ?
what ? no . nothing like that .
i ...
i had to rescind the offer ...
to maria .
you &apos;re mad ?
no .
i &apos;m disappointed .
sheila ...
you &apos;re not the man i thought you were .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t have a choice .
it was jessica pearson &apos;s decision .
okay , well , then i must have read you wrong
&apos;cause i thought you were a strong , powerful senior partner .
i am .
the evidence suggests otherwise .
i think you should go .
sheila , please .
i mean , can &apos;t this snaff just be something we laugh at ?
like , in an hour and a half , hour and 45 minutes ?
your sexual prowess isn &apos;t gonna get you out of this .
you are mad .
yeah .
i put my reputation on the line to close maria .
look , it &apos;s not my fault .
the firm instituted a hiring freeze .
if there &apos;s a hiring freeze going on ,
then why do i know for a fact
that harvey specter hired a fifth @-@ year associate today ?
you offered katrina bennett a job ?
i looked into her .
turns out she &apos;s a stellar candidate .
you bribed her .
a bribe requires a clear exchange
of something for something else .
that didn &apos;t happen here .
bullshit .
she said she &apos;d put the deal through if you offered her a job .
she said she &apos;d put the deal through ,
then i offered her a job .
oh , right , because you needed an insurance policy .
because i could see exactly what you were gonna do .
so you offered her a job to get her to do what you wanted .
that &apos;s something for something else .
you bribed her .
you bet your ass i did .
but what you &apos;re too stupid to understand is
i did it to save you .
get it through your goddamn head .
you &apos;re not like other lawyers .
you break attorney @-@ client privilege .
nothing different happens with liam ,
but they &apos;re sure as sh-- gonna look into you .
and you and i both know what they &apos;re gonna find when they do .
what difference does it make what they find ?
there &apos;s such a thing as right and wrong .
and we &apos;re wrong !
you know what ?
i have had it up to here with you blaming me
for every hard choice that comes with this job .
harvey , come on .
shut up !
is your life better or worse than before i hired you ?
it &apos;s both .
well , maybe you should focus on the better ,
because the next time i have the option
to cross a line to save you ,
i &apos;ll send you packing and not think twice .
now get your shit together .
is it done ?
it &apos;s done .
thank you . what &apos;s wrong ?
that &apos;s wrong ? a man is dead .
you killed him , and i have to live with it .
and you think i don &apos;t know that ?
i get to go back to my life like nothing happened ,
but something did happen .
it makes me sick .
it should .
is that why you came here , to make me feel worse ?
you &apos;ve been given a gift that you don &apos;t deserve .
so you better clean yourself up
and figure out a way to make up for albert chung .
you brought flowers . you &apos;re learning .
they &apos;re for olivia .
what about me ?
that &apos;s for you .
you bought me a ... car ?
yeah , i was thinking we &apos;d drive up to the berkshires .
there &apos;s a little cabin i know .
it &apos;s got its own sauna ,
private chef .
i can &apos;t go away with you , harvey .
why not ?
my brother &apos;s got cancer .
he &apos;s-- he &apos;s not gonna make it .
oh , my god .
her dad .
i mean , we knew that it was coming .
we just didn &apos;t know it would be this fast .
is she here ?
no .
but i &apos;m going to my parents &apos; ,
and i &apos;m gonna-- i &apos;m gonna take her with me .
i &apos;m gonna raise her .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i thought , you know , when ...
you saw olivia was here ,
that we &apos;d reschedule or something , you know ?
and then ...
i saw you with her , and it ...
it was ...
you wanted to have a night .
okay , i didn &apos;t think it would lead to that .
but i &apos;m really happy that it did .
when are you going ?
soon .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
surprise .
hey , i never heard from you . how did the case go ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
that bad , huh ?
yeah , that bad .
well , why don &apos;t you come over here ,
and i &apos;ll make you feel better ?
i already started without you .
i can &apos;t do this anymore , tess .
get high ?
it &apos;s so disgusting .
what got into you ?
this whole thing is disgusting .
are you breaking up with me ?
do you love your husband ?
what ?
it &apos;s a simple question , tess , answer it .
do you love your husband ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
see , i don &apos;t even know that .
because we never even talk about it .
well , we can talk about it now .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it now !
tess , there is such a thing as right and wrong .
and what we &apos;re doing here ...
it &apos;s just wrong , and ...
you &apos;re married .
and i don &apos;t want a part of it anymore .
what if i wasn &apos;t ?
mike .
you need to go .
