the sullivan family disappeared in barbados 8 hours ago .
from the airport ?
how old are the children ?
10 and 14 .
here we go again .
barbados ? americans on foreign soil
is jack garrett &apos;s territory .
cruz says there &apos;s more to it .
how you been , jack ?
busy . i wish this was under better circumstances .
want to fill us in ?
all right ,
one last thing .
we know that you &apos;re all at the top of your class ,
but any ideas on why i chose you for this rotation ?
our knowledge of international law ?
well , that certainly helps .
but your essays revealed moments that forever changed
the way you look at the world .
it &apos;s your passion for justice .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
that &apos;s what you need to hold on to .
all right , send me your thoughts
on the anti @-@ kidnapping initiative and we will discuss next time .
thanks , agent lambert .
it &apos;s lily .
jack &apos;s on his way . wants to debrief in five .
where &apos;s the case ?
barbados . family &apos;s been kidnapped .
ok , i need the legal statutes .
you are the best .
ambassador &apos;s on line 2 .
oh , and see if the caribbean court has any revisions .
ambassador .
yes , we just heard .
absolutely .
matt , hold on .
we &apos;ll call you from the tarmac with our eta .
see you soon .
how far away are you ?
i just left the house .
matt is 20 minutes away .
well , tell him he &apos;s driving .
did you hear that ?
yeah . copy that .
cruz briefed hotch and rossi .
is he gathering the rest of the bau ?
as we speak . everything ready in barbados ?
just coordinated with the ambassador .
great .
our unsub &apos;s eluded both domestic
and international teams ,
and we &apos;re not about to let him get away with it again .
as you all remember ,
last april the isaacs family was killed in florida ,
and the everetts were killed in aruba the year before that .
both families were found 24 hours after they were taken .
each family member had been strangled
and their bodies were dumped in a remote area .
the trails went cold .
all signs pointed to the everetts
being his first victims .
because of the hands @-@ on , intimate nature of the kills ,
we thought it was personal .
and we built on that theory with the
isaacs in florida , but to no avail .
now that he &apos;s moved internationally again ,
it &apos;s time to rethink the motive .
it &apos;s clear he gets off on hunting american families
when they &apos;re on vacation .
just over 8 hours ago he abducted the sullivans from barbados .
it feels like he &apos;s establishing a clear pattern .
he started overseas , came back to the states ,
and now he &apos;s gone to another country again .
the month of april has some sort of significance to him .
maybe it &apos;s easy hunting season .
all the kills were during spring break vacations .
it takes guts and skill to snatch a whole family ,
but you wouldn &apos;t know it by watching him .
the higher the risk , the lower his heart rate .
a true sociopath .
and the family &apos;s too tired from a long day of travel
to see the ruse .
and the unsub &apos;s probably too charismatic
to set off any instinctual alarms .
i need both domestic and international teams
working together on this .
if our unsub sticks to his pattern ,
he &apos;ll kill the sullivans by sunrise .
kate , you and reid go to the sullivans &apos; house in fairfax county .
look for links between them and the other victims .
we need to establish whether he &apos;s stalking them at their homes
before they take their trips .
the rest of us will head to barbados .
sir , we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
please tell me monty &apos;s on this with us .
yes , he &apos;s on his way .
agent simmons will be with us .
so , our jet or yours ?
we &apos;ll flip for it .
no matter how fast light travels ,
it finds the darkness is always there first .
terry pratchett .
we &apos;ll be ready for takeoff in 5 minutes ..
3 families , 3 countries in 3 years .
this guy &apos;s on a mission .
what &apos;s he trying to prove ?
each kill makes him feel more empowered .
he &apos;s addicted to it . thinks he &apos;s invincible .
well , he isn &apos;t .
hey , hey , haven &apos;t seen you guys in a while .
matt simmons .
passing ships , man . how you doing ?
good .
morgan , you married yet .
working on it .
so , uh , how old &apos;s the baby now ?
which one ? he &apos;s quite a breeder .
i have 4 under 3 .
last round was twins .
oh , my god . your wife is a saint .
that she is .
so you know what i thought was weird about florida
is that there were no drugs found in any of the victims &apos; systems ,
which is strange , because i figured
that &apos;s how he was controlling them .
yeah , i thought the same thing in aruba .
nothing showed up in the tox screen .
but their metabolism could have been
through a hypno in a few hours .
true . it &apos;s easy , cheap , efficient .
he used some kind of leather ligature
to beat them and finish the job .
our guess was a belt .
it must mean something to him .
well , that weapon versus bare hands
certainly prolongs the strangulation .
he gets off on controlling their lives until the very end .
he could have kept hunting in florida .
it &apos;s a target rich environment for his type .
right . but he didn &apos;t .
instead he chose barbados , of all places .
more couples than families who vacation there .
he &apos;s making it harder on himself .
and us .
there &apos;s not much going on here evidence wise .
except those ball caps .
the first two times he wore orange ,
now he &apos;s switched to blue .
bonjour , crime @-@ fighters times two . ok ,
i did some digging on the sullivans
and they just got their passports .
this trip was their first stamp .
inexperienced travelers tend to make the easiest targets
because they &apos;re isolated , they &apos;re stressed from customs ,
sometimes there &apos;s even a language barrier .
and all those unfamiliar sights and sounds
add to their culture shock .
yeah , that &apos;s why airports are the biggest trap .
a few creature comforts , atms , restaurants ,
they trick you into letting your guard down .
there are predators waiting to strike .
yeah , well , i ran their specs
through vicap and interpol again ,
and the only things that are dinging
are the suitcases we already know about .
garcia , coordinate with the state department
on passport activity in barbados and cross that with aruba
from a few years ago .
copy , copy .
monty , monty !
you come here to me . oh !
you can put yourself there .
all right .
greg sullivan &apos;s parents just checked in downstairs .
yeah ? and ?
the ones who called this in .
would you like to meet them ?
oh , i don &apos;t do--
i thought that you just stayed back
with the t @-@ 1 line like me .
is that something you do all the time ?
yeah . since my team &apos;s usually an ocean away ,
it means that i &apos;m the only one here
to let the loved ones know
we &apos;re doing the best we can .
what if it &apos;s not a happy thing ?
then it &apos;s a really bad day .
wow . that sounds lonely .
sometimes it is ,
but we &apos;re not going to think about that right now ,
because what this family needs
is a little sunshine .
ok .
come on . let &apos;s do this .
ok .
you &apos;re the only person i &apos;d do this with .
updated alarm system ,
no dog doors or hidden points of entry .
garage is even detached . i don &apos;t think the unsub
infiltrated this house without them knowing .
is this the stuff you got from florida ?
well , all the families took the same
cautious approach while traveling .
so , he didn &apos;t stalk them from home ,
he did it from barbados .
probably tracked the flights on his phone ,
saw the delays , and knew that he &apos;d found his victim type .
yeah , obviously he has a clear ideal .
statistically , annihilators are fathers
who &apos;ve lost or killed their own families
and are trying to replace their role in the unit .
ok , so let &apos;s see what type of father he wants to be .
my guess is the m.e. report will support your theory .
it &apos;s good to see you .
jack , how you been ?
great , thanks .
of course you know lambert and simmons .
this is the embassy &apos;s regional security officer .
fitz , this is the team i was telling you about .
ssas hotchner , rossi ,
morgan , and jareau .
they &apos;re experts in family annihilators
and worked this offender &apos;s case last year .
well , i hate that it takes another abduction
to bring out all the big guns ,
but i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
come on in . i &apos;ll show you around .
the ambassador wants to keep this quiet .
&apos;cause he doesn &apos;t want the host government to be embarrassed .
10,000 americans victimized overseas each year
and state &apos;s worried about diplomacy .
in this case , it &apos;s island economics .
anything that stops money from coming in
gets swept under the rug .
other places , challenges can be more political .
if we thought other families were in danger ,
i &apos;d argue that we should make a statement ,
but i think this guy has what he wants .
what about the van ?
tags were stolen .
registered to a rotting vw bus .
of course .
and the make , model , and color all match
a popular service van on the island . they &apos;re a dime a dozen .
and what about the driver ? are there a lot of americans
driving shuttles around here ?
half the service industry are expats who work here all winter .
problem is , most people don &apos;t report
their presence in the embassy ,
so we have no record of knowing who &apos;s even here .
well , he &apos;s been here long enough
to know his way around back roads .
this kind of ruse isn &apos;t easy to pull off at night .
our technical analysts are tracking passport activity
over the past 6 months .
that &apos;s a good start .
morgan , you an jj should head to the abduction site .
simmons , go ahead and join them .
i &apos;m gonna run leads in town . you want to come ?
sounds good .
great .
and then there were two .
it seems like you &apos;ve got a great team there .
so do you .
if the pattern holds ,
we &apos;ve only got 12 hours to find them alive .
olly olly oxen free .
olly olly oxen free !
olly olly oxen free !
look at me !
you ruin everything !
greg ! greg , help us !
colleen !
greg , help us !
i &apos;ll show you !
stop crying !
daddy , please !
no , daddy !
it &apos;s our job to protect them .
no matter how old they are , they &apos;re still our children .
oh , my goodness . no , you can &apos;t blame yourself .
last year , around this same time ,
i read this story about this family in florida .
they also were on vacation .
oh , please , just tell us it wasn &apos;t the same monster .
men like that seem like monsters .
but they &apos;re actually human .
and our teams are the best at seeing that difference .
that &apos;s why i know we &apos;ll find who has your family .
now , is there anything you can tell us about greg
or colleen or the the kids ,
anything that can help find this man ?
greg won &apos;t let anyone hurt his family .
not without a hell of a fight .
good .
see , that &apos;s--that &apos;s good .
you just said that greg being a fighter is a good thing ,
and we both know that that is not true .
the unsub is gonna see it as some sort of alpha male challenge ,
which is not good at all .
i know .
but right now they need to feel hopeful .
ok . i hadn &apos;t thought of that .
there &apos;s plenty of hidden cameras ,
but no sign of the unsub inside .
he must have waited in the van
and got a view of the sullivans from there .
or weather caused a delay ,
which made them miss the shuttle .
there &apos;s no way the unsub planned any of that .
it says a lot that his victim ideals
matter more than when he strikes .
so in each case , he watched , he waited ,
and hunted until the right family came along .
this bastard &apos;s been searching for his next vics .
he &apos;s been here before last night .
he &apos;s been building his trap .
the only thing he hadn &apos;t planned was who he &apos;d take .
we need to check footage going back to the first of april .
i have 15 vans like that
and lots of drivers from the states ,
but i don &apos;t know him .
ok . thanks .
thank you .
have you traveled much with your son ?
not a lot , no .
have you ever wanted to just lock him away
until the world &apos;s a safe place ?
yeah . then he &apos;d never get out .
last time i saw you , you said
there was a lead in your brother &apos;s case .
oh , it was a dead end .
he &apos;s in thailand , right ?
yeah . classic naive american abroad for the first time .
victimization is the last thing on his mind
because he thought carrying a u.s. passport
meant he was protected .
any other suspects ?
i &apos;ve been trying to put the pieces together ,
but the few postcards i got before it all went sideways
painted this grand adventure .
i keep looking at who was in his stories .
was it the girl he wrote about ?
was it the guys he went rock climbing with ?
someone knew he was the perfect patsy
and they framed him .
if you ever want me to take a look at the case , i &apos;d be happy to .
thanks , hotch .
a fresh pair of eyes would be great .
i &apos;ll take you up on that .
excuse me .
hey , ladies , you need a ride ?
is this your van ?
no , not one of mine .
i give you a ride anywhere .
best cabs in town .
yes . ok . what you want to do is make a left ...
lily .
go left !
no weapon .
cash and cocaine .
any i.d. ?
he just got here .
it &apos;s not him .
he &apos;s all yours .
please , daddy , stop !
i won &apos;t do it again !
it &apos;s always your fault !
i can &apos;t breathe !
thanks , garcia .
the dynamic duo narrowed it down to 1,000 americans
who visited aruba and barbados , but they need our help .
want to search visas ?
americans don &apos;t need a visa here .
well , damn .
where &apos;s your head ?
well , this guy needs privacy ,
and he &apos;s got a lot of it here .
there &apos;s hundreds of acres of undeveloped and isolated land .
so he knows the area well enough to cover his tracks .
no !
ok .
we have tastes from england , portugal , spain , and west africa .
and this is my absolute favorite , flying fish .
do you guys eat like this wherever you go ?
pretty much .
if you ever need another consultation , you know where to find me .
so you said there was good news ?
yeah , garcia and monty sent us some footage .
it should be on both screens .
we got this guy trolling inside and outside
the terminal over the past two weeks .
he &apos;s focused on families at night , when they &apos;re exhausted .
but there &apos;s this .
yeah , and clock his footwork .
ok , that move would have sent me to my masseuse .
this guy &apos;s athletic and he &apos;s strong .
and he &apos;s younger than we thought .
go ahead , kate .
we reviewed the m.e. reports
and confirmed that the unsub externalizes rage ,
specifically towards the two fathers .
there was an escalation on the last victim , mr. isaacs .
water torture and whipping marks ,
likely from the same belt used to kill him .
sounds like he &apos;s getting revenge .
given his youth and the anger ,
he &apos;s not trying to fill the father role
like we initially thought .
he &apos;s inserting himself as the firstborn child
who has the most rage at his father .
hey ! don &apos;t just stand there , reel it in !
you &apos;re doing it wrong .
we believe we &apos;re looking for a white male
in his early to mid @-@ 20s .
but how does one guy control and kill entire families ?
do you think he &apos;s got an accomplice ?
we ruled that out in aruba .
his obsessions are too personal to share .
it &apos;s his intense preparation that gives him the upper hand .
given his age and his aggression ,
he &apos;s an internal annihilator .
his victims are surrogates for his own dysfunctional family .
once he gets them alone ,
he isolates the greatest physical threat , the father .
this makes him feel superior .
and he thrives on that power .
it gives him the confidence he needs
to charm them and harm them .
sounds like a wolf in sheep &apos;s clothing .
something like that .
and what we &apos;ve learned about
unsubs on foreign soil is they &apos;re adaptable ,
both socially and culturally .
it &apos;s the level of intelligence
that often makes them more dangerous .
the fathers are the last to die ,
forced to watch each family member be killed .
his abuse or neglect made him feel angry and alone .
the damage was done long ago
and imprinted on him .
and he won &apos;t back away from this .
he &apos;s driven to kill these families .
fitz , we need the locals back out there .
someone has seen this man .
blow it out .
blow it out .
daddy , please .
blow it out !
do it !
there you go .
there you go .
stop crying ! you ruin everything !
i told you to shut up !
shut up !
shut up !
shut up !
don &apos;t touch her !
what are you gonna do about it ?
nothing !
sit down !
clear the table !
listen to me .
i &apos;ve counted 6 families that
he passed up because they weren &apos;t his ideal .
they have no clue how close he was to them .
it gives me the jeebies .
you there ?
uh , yeah .
check this out .
oh , you &apos;re a good egg .
it keeps me motivated .
my mom used to draw .
well , that makes sense .
it &apos;s in the genes .
ok . what do you got besides mad skills ?
ok . these license plates are from all over .
he didn &apos;t just steal tags from the vw bus .
each day he &apos;s got a new one .
that &apos;s a serious forensic countermeasure .
he &apos;s taking a risk stealing all these tags .
where &apos;s he getting them from ?
someplace they won &apos;t miss them .
junkyards ?
ah , see , but this one traces back to a rental car .
no one ever reported the tags stolen .
it happens all the time .
criminals target people who won &apos;t report crimes .
they figure you &apos;re on vacation ,
you don &apos;t want to be inconvenienced with a police report .
no one ever thinks something this small could be a clue
to a bigger crime , but it is ,
and that &apos;s how our trails run cold .
then we have think like he does ,
find easy targets for plenty of tags .
hit me .
this is interesting . the first kills in aruba
were less organized and lacked the intense torture
we saw in florida with the isaacs .
well , maybe it &apos;s because he
had a year in between kills to perfect his game .
it could be , but what if it &apos;s more than that ?
what if his rage in florida was some kind of statement ?
like what ?
i &apos;m gonna punish the americans on american soil .
so something bad happened to him in florida .
and i think it must have involved water .
why would you say that ?
all the fathers showed signs of near drowning ,
but we never figured out why .
i double @-@ checked the salinity levels in the fathers &apos; lungs .
in aruba it was freshwater ,
but in mr. isaacs &apos; case ,
it was a combination of fresh and saltwater .
well , the everglades are fresh ,
the gulf and atlantic are salt .
where do they meet ?
at the florida bay , but that &apos;s the bottom of the state .
that would have been a 5 @-@ hour car ride from the abduction site .
well , the isaacs were found an hour outside of orlando ,
so , what did he do , abduct them from the airport ,
drive south to torture them ,
then drive another 5 hours to the dump site ?
i know this guy is cocky ,
but he wouldn &apos;t keep them on the road that long .
agreed . way too risky .
so what if he didn &apos;t take the risk ?
what are you thinking ?
he abducted them in orlando .
he could drive them to the coast .
that &apos;s only an hour away .
then he gets them to one of these beach towns ,
say , cocoa , daytona , melbourne ,
transfers them to the secluded , controlled environment
we know he needs for the torture .
but the journey south and then north would take 24 hours .
he &apos;s got them on a boat .
sit down .
run !
run ! run !
hurry ! go , go , go !
yeah , hey .
i need some intel on marinas around here .
he has contacts everywhere .
yeah .
it &apos;s that military brotherhood .
there &apos;s nothing else like it .
well , that &apos;s gotta come in handy .
the boat would have launched from somewhere isolated .
we can narrow this down by looking at the boats
12 to 24 miles from shore .
wouldn &apos;t he go farther out ?
he doesn &apos;t need to . barbados has no jurisdiction
once he &apos;s in international waters .
then he &apos;ll never be charged for his crimes .
that can &apos;t be legal .
the law of the ship is the
law of the country whose flag he &apos;s flying .
my guess is he &apos;s done his research
and registered to a country
that doesn &apos;t have the resources to prosecute .
we &apos;re tracking all vessels large enough to hold 4 people captive .
he doesn &apos;t risk a long drive , so we &apos;re looking for marinas
closest to the airport .
problem is , there &apos;s a dock in every direction .
ok , my contact says there &apos;s an industrial marina
about a half an hour from the airport .
it &apos;s isolated .
it probably would have been quiet last night .
go check it out .
we &apos;ll come with you .
i got water and air reinforcements waiting on your call .
we can &apos;t do a blind search . if he knows we &apos;re onto him ,
he &apos;ll kill the sullivans .
this is your fault .
your fault !
yeah , this is definitely it .
same license plate .
looks like he used rohypnol , like you said .
colorless , odorless , tasteless .
that makes them easier to control .
there &apos;s not a lot of foot traffic out here ,
even during the day .
we could try a canvass ,
but my guess is he was probably too quick
to be spotted .
and he left his keys in the cup holder .
so what do you want to bet ...
tank &apos;s almost full .
30 miles from the airport to here .
he filled up the night he took the sullivans .
hey , baby girl .
hey , handsome . i was just about to call you .
well , ladies first .
and a gent , don &apos;t forget .
oh , that &apos;s right . my bad .
how you doin &apos; , monty ?
hey , morgan .
so monty , wonder person ,
found about a dozen license plates
that scumbag had put on the van .
he stole a few off of rental cars and took the rest
off of old cars at a repair shop near the airport .
was there a gas station ?
indeed .
security footage ?
you know it .
we &apos;re sending it to your phones now .
there he is .
didn &apos;t see the camera , did you ?
or he &apos;s just a cocky son of a bitch .
hey , monty , can you run
this guy &apos;s mug through facial recognition ?
it &apos;s going now , but they &apos;re processing 8 million images .
even with the bonded t @-@ 1 it could take a while .
we don &apos;t have a while .
we &apos;re hitting a dead end
with unsolved cases involving water .
i &apos;ve been thinking we should look at solved cases .
this unsub isn &apos;t old enough to be a hardened criminal .
but his countermeasures and his confidence
feel like he &apos;s had a lot of practice .
so what if he were a budding psychopath ?
we should check homicides going back to his teens .
lily , cross with juvenile custody worldwide .
and check which countries have
blue and orange in their flags .
or sports teams . there &apos;s a reason he chose those colors .
we just haven &apos;t found it yet .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s american ?
he has some sort of connection to the states .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s attacking american families .
now that we feel that he may have committed murder ,
it &apos;s doubtful that state would grant him a passport .
what country would ?
plenty .
wait , but if he was guilty of something horrific before ,
wouldn &apos;t he still be locked up ?
not necessarily .
remember when natalee holloway disappeared ?
it &apos;ll be 10 years ago in may .
the prime suspect was never put away despite our profile .
he was free . and 5 years later to the day ,
he abducted and killed another young woman in peru .
van der sloot went dormant ,
but his underlying homicidal behavior grew stronger .
that definitely could have happened here .
that means the everetts in aruba reignited
his devious fantasies .
so if they weren &apos;t his first victims , who were ?
his own family .
narrow it down to sons who killed their fathers .
that &apos;s it .
what ?
look at this .
the only sign of outward frustration .
he nearly gets hit by a car . right here .
instead of yelling at the driver , he holds it in .
then he has a passive @-@ aggressive moment .
he taps the center of his head like this .
that &apos;s a gesture ,
and it means stupid or crazy in dutch culture .
oranje . the netherlands soccer team .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s wearing a blue and orange hat .
he &apos;s not american . lily .
already on it .
it &apos;s ok .
don &apos;t touch him !
get away from him .
this is it . the tidwell family
was massacred in their hotel room
while on holiday in 2004 .
physical and behavioral evidence
pointed to the troubled 15 @-@ year @-@ old son jerry .
he was declared temporarily insane
and hospitalized until he was 21 .
if tidwell &apos;s the unsub ,
