phil , honey !
phil !
hey , check it out .
grandpa sent us another
postcard from his rv trip .
&quot; mount rushmore ?
i wish the tour guide would have rushed more . &quot;
phil , we have got to do something
about amber and ronnie &apos;s boat .
that thing is making it impossible
to park in our driveway , and it &apos;s an eyesore .
on the other hand , they &apos;re our neighbors
and we have to see them everyday .
i worry about ... rocking the boat .
you know you can do better .
keeping me honest . i love it .
yeah , the boat is trashy .
living next to it doesn &apos;t feel &quot; on brand &quot; for me .
you know , with sea levels rising at their current rate ,
we should be glad we live near a boat .
okay , so , that &apos;s three for &quot; get rid of the boat . &quot;
luke ?
count me out .
this isn &apos;t a police state .
that boat isn &apos;t hurting anyone .
here &apos;s all you need to know about that boat .
one -- tammy lafontaine sunbathes on it .
two -- my eyeballs like looking at tammy lafontaine sunbathing .
don &apos;t make me the bad guy here .
you know that obnoxious thing annoys you , too .
yeah , it does , but we need to finesse this --
be nice about it .
the last thing we need
is some huge feud with our crazy neighbors .
movie idea .
i &apos;ll put on the list .
comedy or drama ?
depends on casting .
there &apos;s got to be some kind of regulation about this .
i &apos;m gonna call the city .
that &apos;s a terrible idea .
uh , no , a terrible idea
is a movie about a guy who can fax himself places .
&apos;cause you haven &apos;t heard the title -- &quot; just the fax man . &quot;
that water can &apos;t hit us soon enough .
hey , where have you guys been ?
the san vicente branch of the public library ,
and then ice cream .
that was a weirdly specific answer .
well , everything is normal .
usually when everything is normal ,
people don &apos;t respond in
perfectly rehearsed unison .
now who &apos;s being weirdly specific .
well , if you went to the library ,
why don &apos;t you have any books ?
we read there .
i read &quot; clifford the big red dog . &quot;
and i read richard chamberlain &apos;s autobiography .
did you know he did hamlet in london ?
yes , i remember you telling me about that
at the san vicente branch of the public library .
okay , well , why don &apos;t you go clean your room now , sweetie ?
great idea .
lily , don &apos;t forget your backpack .
whoa , what &apos;s this ?
cam , clown supplies ?
uh , yeah , those are mine .
we just had to pick them up from the dry cleaner .
also mine .
oh , my gosh , they must
have shrunk them in the wash !
did they wash them 40,000 times ?
okay , look .
it &apos;s no big deal , but i took lily
to a junior clown college this morning .
are you serious ? behind my back ?
yes , because i knew you wouldn &apos;t approve .
what was i supposed to do ?
not take her because you know
how i feel about all this mumbo jumbo .
该词源于西非某部落的一个戴面具的舞者
mumbo jumbo was like a father to me .
i have been very up front with you .
you knew going in
that i wanted to raise our child as a clown .
yes , but then i finally
realized that you weren &apos;t joking
and we agreed that we would wait
until she was old enough to decide for herself .
you do stuff with her all the time ,
and you don &apos;t ask me for my permission .
just last week ,
you took her to the doctor without even asking !
&apos;cause she had an ear infection !
let &apos;s say we &apos;re even !
bravo !
you ate all of your blueberries !
that gets applause ?
i just finished the friday
crossword puzzle and nothing .
i guess everyone knows
herbert hoover &apos;s middle name .
look what i got --
a throne for our little king .
do we have to put the toilet on the counter ?
i take my afternoon coffee here .
let &apos;s fix one problem at a time .
i &apos;ve decided to potty @-@ train joe .
no , too soon .
it &apos;s too soon for a pearl harbor joke ,
perfect time for this .
i don &apos;t want to rush him .
too much pressure and he will get traumatized .
he &apos;s grown up drinking from a breast bigger than his head .
i don &apos;t think he scares easy .
the kid &apos;s ready , plus , if i &apos;m being honest ,
i &apos;m tired of buying diapers .
excuse me , where do you keep the diapers ?
right over here , sir .
you trying to be funny ?
we have larger sizes .
he &apos;s gonna do great .
why wouldn &apos;t he ?
there &apos;s no one better than joe , right ?
i &apos;m better than joe .
at his age ,
i was counting to 10 in three languages .
the bar is so low for that kid ,
except when they play limbo .
they hold it up so high anybody can get under it .
i didn &apos;t see you there .
really ?
so , is that your creepy twin brother
who &apos;s been staring at me
from the window for the last week ?
uh , i could lie and say &quot; yes . &quot;
you could pretend you weren &apos;t flattered ,
but why not just cut to the chase ?
and what would that be ?
i could maybe touch something of yours ?
sure , and i could maybe kick something of yours .
i like this tension .
very &quot; will they , when will they ? &quot;
go back to your room , little boy .
got it . i &apos;ll see you from there .
once we approach them with this ,
it &apos;s gonna be awfully hard for me to log in
with my anonymous call to the city .
you &apos;re not gonna have to report anyone .
call me david copperfield ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to make a boat disappear .
hey , neighbors . i made you some banana bread .
oh , i love banana bread .
we have this at our dispensary ,
except we got weed in it .
but we could give this one to our kids as a trick .
this boat is really something .
you know what we call her ?
&quot; jackpot &quot; !
&apos;cause you sell pot .
holy cow , we never thought of that .
this is the best day of my life !
permission to come aboard and check her out ?
yeah !
that is , if you &apos;re talking about my boat and not my wife .
ooh , yeah , you can &apos;t climb aboard me .
well , not in the driveway , anyway .
this is so great .
yeah .
did you do something new with your hair ?
did you get a new wig or something ?
sweet boat like this belongs in the water , am i right ?
well , you know , people who put their boat in the water ,
they only use it on the weekend .
we get to use this baby every day .
can you imagine
visiting this boat every day in the marina ?
you spend a bunch of money on something ,
you want people to see it .
that &apos;s why i wear low @-@ cut tops .
yeah ! listen up .
i just got to be honest .
we &apos;re having a hard time with the boat here .
what , you don &apos;t like jackpot ?
it &apos;s gigantic and makes it pretty tough
to park in our driveway .
well , that &apos;s because you open your doors onto our driveway ,
where we keep our boat .
yes , and , according to city regulations ,
it shouldn &apos;t even be here .
&quot; regulations . &quot; hear that ?
look , we really do want to keep this friendly .
and it &apos;s been here for three weeks .
yeah , and it &apos;s beautiful .
and it &apos;s tacky .
settle down !
hey , that is uncool !
there are four aces on the side of it .
you know what ?
we &apos;re gonna have to ask you to disembark .
that &apos;s boat for &quot; get off . &quot;
yeah , there &apos;s no room up here for an uptight buzzkill .
don &apos;t call her a buzzkill .
that &apos;s right . there &apos;s a lot of people who think i &apos;m fun .
you complain about fireworks friday ,
you complain when my son plays his kick @-@ ass drum set ,
you bought curtains for your bedroom window .
what have we ever done to you ?
i think you just answered your own question .
all right , you know what ?
here , take your buzz @-@ free banana bread
and go back to your precious driveway .
with pleasure .
by the way , claire ,
earlier , i was just being nice .
i do not like your new wig .
hey , what you don &apos;t like is her real hair !
phil !
uh , not the color .
hey , phil !
still think we need to be nice ?
no . it &apos;s time for more drastic measures .
no one insults ... my banana bread .
mitchell .
f @-@ fiz-- no ! no !
what have i said about you sneaking up on me ?
i could have been shaving .
this could have been a sweeney todd moment .
because of me , clowning is in lily &apos;s blood .
adopted .
but she &apos;s a natural , and we &apos;re gonna prove it to you .
if she doesn &apos;t make you laugh ,
she &apos;ll quit clowning forever .
come on .
please .
i present to you the asian for any occasion ,
the clown that will invert that frown ,
the dynamic duo of fizbo and ...
lizbo !
are you not hearing that ?
we &apos;re working on the name .
oh , no , fizbo dropped his hat .
where did it go , lizbo ?
it &apos;s right there .
there it is !
no , fizbo ! no !
what ? i &apos;m just putting my hat back on , lizbo .
oh , my --
confetti --
i hope fizbo knows how to vacuum .
who turned out the lights ? !
you &apos;re just spreading it around .
i tried to be supportive for lily .
i really did , but i wanted to kill myself .
that &apos;s not part of the routine .
she &apos;s a natural . do it again .
okay , here we go . nothing to it .
make it rain .
yeah , i @-@ i get it .
you -- you can &apos;t pee with another guy looking at you .
not a bad thing , by the way .
son of a gun , his middle name was clark .
jay !
may we have some privacy , please ?
for what ?
so that joe can keep chewing on the electrical cord ?
o @-@ oh , we &apos;re -- we &apos;re not clapping for this ?
i told you that he was not ready , and when he is ,
why don &apos;t you let his mother take care of it ?
you know , i raised two fully functional children .
you have two kids that i don &apos;t know about ?
please , just let joe go on his own schedule .
manny learned to potty @-@ train when he was 2.1 / 2 .
you told me it was 13 months .
i may have exaggerated a little bit .
2.1 / 2 isn &apos;t advanced at all .
what else did you exaggerate ?
did i really like shakespeare when i was 3 ?
not so much shakespeare as jello .
was my first word really &quot; latte &quot; ?
not so much &quot; latte &quot; as &quot; jello . &quot;
oh , my god . i &apos;m normal .
trust me , kid , no one &apos;s saying that about you .
why did you tell me all those things ?
to give you confidence .
you needed it because you were having
so much trouble learning how to read .
this makes no sense .
yes , that what you always used to say .
i wasn &apos;t deterred .
i knew lily had what it took to be a great clown .
i mean ...
she just needed to find her persona ,
and that process can be painful , especially for me .
ohh , lily !
good morning , neighbors .
beautiful day , huh ?
don &apos;t even try to sweet @-@ talk us .
this tacky boat ain &apos;t going anywhere .
hey , what &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know . what could it be ?
phil is not a vindictive guy .
he still listens to milli vanilli .
it &apos;s a scandal i can dance to .
but ronnie and amber don &apos;t deserve nice phil .
they dissed my woman ,
so i called in the big guns .
you are so sexy right now .
girl , you know it &apos;s true .
oh , there it goes .
is that my son
or am i looking in the world &apos;s most flattering mirror ?
that &apos;s funny and uplifting !
it is !
thanks for coming so fast .
oh . where were you when we called ?
who knows ? it all looks the same .
either arizona or new mexico .
or maybe even regular mexico .
thanks for coming , fellas .
hey , guys .
grandpa !
there &apos;s my little girls . how are you ?
what the hell is this ?
we see your driveway boat
and raise you a convoy of retirees .
oh , i want to have three more of your babies .
how was your road trip ?
the highlight came in branson , missouri ,
when victor rear @-@ ended yakov smirnoff &apos;s s.u.v.
the exchange of information was hilarious ,
but frustrating .
i don &apos;t understand anything that &apos;s happening .
&quot; in my country ,
car has insurance for me . &quot;
that sort of thing .
just laugh .
one day , we &apos;ll treasure these moments .
i guess you guys convinced us .
it &apos;s awesome having giant recreational vehicles
in your front yard .
oh , we see what you two are doing .
you &apos;re gonna see a whole lot more ,
&apos;cause these old guys like to do tai chi in shorty robes .
this ain &apos;t gonna work . i like hanging with old people .
makes me feel in @-@ shape .
they can &apos;t sleep and they can &apos;t hear .
they &apos;re gonna be blasting talk radio all night long .
when i get drunk , i snore real loud ,
so i won &apos;t hear a thing .
we just wanted to give you a taste
of what it &apos;s like to have you for a neighbor .
i love how close together all our mouths are .
okay .
hey , dad , what &apos;s the --
what &apos;s the plot of that rita hayworth movie ?
my friends here were wondering .
that &apos;s my cue .
time to help my boy get rid of a boat .
uh , &quot; lady from shanghai &quot; ?
that &apos;s the one .
i @-@ i can &apos;t remember all the details .
pretty sure there was a horse in that movie .
or was it a baby ?
funny thing -- none of it was in shanghai .
or was all of it in shanghai ?
anyway , where was i ? oh , right .
so , either the horse or this baby ...
i &apos;m just putting these in the car .
i help underprivileged kids lift weights .
you can &apos;t even drive yet .
okay , you know my secret . what &apos;s yours ?
do you honestly think any of this is gonna work ?
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
i @-@ i have no clue what to say when i &apos;m around you ,
but i think about you all the time .
fine . here &apos;s my secret .
i put all these walls up and act tough ,
but ... i &apos;ve never really been with a boy before .
really ?
because i &apos;ve never been with a girl .
oh , my god . pathetic .
run home to your mommy , you little bitch .
is lizbo in here ?
i think she &apos;s in our room .
cam .
you know , you wouldn &apos;t be in this position
if you hadn &apos;t gone behind my back .
i wouldn &apos;t be in this position if i had ...
a supportive husband .
okay . really , i would love to hear how this is my fault .
yesterday , lily performed her heart out for you .
she was so excited to do that broom routine ,
and you gave her nothing .
so she got desperate ,
and she resorted to mean @-@ spirited gags .
and then all of a sudden , guess what .
you &apos;re mister mcgiggles !
oh , is he like an uncle to you ?
you know what hurt the most is that my husband
turned our daughter against something that i love .
guys , we appreciate all your help ,
but you probably shouldn &apos;t be up there .
i don &apos;t mind .
is that weed i smell ?
wait , you gave them pot ?
no , i run a legitimate business .
i &apos;m not gonna risk it for that .
they brought their own .
dad ?
not me , son .
it &apos;s me and victor .
makes my arthritis feel better .
and i &apos;m in remission from being lame .
here &apos;s your beer , frank .
thank you , ronnie .
right on .
here you go , guys . pigs in a blanket .
thank you , darling .
what are you guys doing ? !
you &apos;re supposed to be annoying them .
these guys could never annoy me .
what ?
oh , ronnie !
sorry , son , it turns out ronnie &apos;s a fellow army man .
plus , at our age ,
it &apos;s tough not to like someone who pays attention to us .
unbelievable .
i should have known better .
my dad &apos;s too loveable .
it &apos;s always been his biggest flaw .
hey , smells like a party !
back inside .
okay , then .
* take your body down to the potty *
* to have some fun and go number one *
what is this filth ?
i tried everything ,
videos , books , parenting websites .
i even tried to make a game out of it .
nothing could get that kid to use the toilet .
by the way , do not search &quot; peeing games &quot; on the internet .
okay , joe , what &apos;s it gonna be ? i &apos;m a wealthy man .
just give me a number .
seven .
i just found out that &apos;s how old i was
when i learned to tie my shoes .
not 2 , like i was told .
okay , please , manny .
i might have exaggerated a little bit ,
but i do that all the time .
columbia actually is a very normal place .
my accomplishments are all lies .
i can only deal with one traumatized child at a time .
please , jay , let that poor baby off the toilet .
okay , new plan--
we leave him on the throne till he conks out ,
then we dunk his hand in a bowl of warm water--
that &apos;s crazy .
you know that you can &apos;t rush these things .
you did it before with claire and with mitch .
i don &apos;t think he did , mom .
yes , he did , right ?
well , i was a little busy building a closet empire .
and racquetball was pretty big back then .
maybe that &apos;s why this is so important to you .
you missed so many milestones in their lives ,
you don &apos;t want to miss them with joe .
this is your second chance .
but don &apos;t worry , jay . he knows you love him .
i &apos;d like him to remember that i &apos;m there for him .
i mean , who knows if i &apos;ll get another chance .
i know . you won &apos;t .
and he won &apos;t have to remember you
because you &apos;re always going to be here .
forget it .
come on . let &apos;s give it a rest .
the poor kid , all that pressure i put on him .
especially his bladder .
you &apos;ve probably got a gallon of apple juice in there , buddy .
did you see that ?
did you see how you understood jay ?
that &apos;s what makes you so special .
anyone can learn how to walk
or pee in a potty .
you &apos;re the most sensitive and insightful person i have ever known ,
and you have always been .
come here , papi .
he &apos;s peeing !
he &apos;s peeing !
my little genius !
i knew you could do it , buddy !
ay , jay , he &apos;s not done .
aw , hell . it &apos;s all over me .
would you take him ?
lily !
oh , it &apos;s you .
okay .
come here . come on . let &apos;s have a little talk .
all right , i know that i have been laughing
at some of the stuff that you &apos;ve been doing to daddy ,
but i shouldn &apos;t have .
i know that you love this ,
but i don &apos;t want you to be the type of clown that hurts people .
i don &apos;t do that to make you laugh .
you don &apos;t ?
well , then why do you do it ?
i hate it . i don &apos;t want to be a clown .
it &apos;s so weird .
oh , are you serious ?
the jokes aren &apos;t funny
and everybody &apos;s all ,
&quot; honk , honk , ah @-@ ooga , wah , wah . &quot;
oh , lily , i love you so much . oh , my gosh .
w @-@ w @-@ why didn &apos;t you just tell him ?
i didn &apos;t want to hurt his feelings .
so i figured if i was a bad clown ,
he &apos;d want me to stop .
oh , honey , you don &apos;t have to worry about that .
he &apos;ll understand .
you don &apos;t have to do what daddy does .
you just need to tell him the truth .
tell me the truth about what ?
nothing !
no , lily , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m sorry , daddy , but i think i want to stop being a clown .
oh , but why ? y @-@ you loved it .
because ...
because i &apos;ll never be as good as fizbo .
he &apos;s just so funny and special and magical .
sweetie -- well , listen .
fizbo is very special .
but you shouldn &apos;t
expect to be as good as he is right away .
it &apos;s too much pressure .
maybe i &apos;ll try again when i &apos;m older .
coming up with a lie like that in the moment --
that girl is no clown .
she &apos;s gonna be a lawyer .
hey , neighbor .
just wanted to say i had a really good time
hanging with your dad last night .
you don &apos;t need to rub it in .
i heard it all night -- you guys singing &quot; chantilly lace . &quot;
no , i &apos;m serious .
we had a long talk .
your dad and his buddies , they &apos;re good people .
they played the whole army card .
and , well , i &apos;m gonna do the honorable thing
and , uh , move the boat .
really ?
yeah , my brother says i can keep it in his driveway .
he hates his neighbor .
i think your dad &apos;s right .
we should start being better to one another .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
i think you &apos;ll see , once you get to know us ,
we &apos;re good people , too ...
there &apos;s no smoke .
i know .
okay , folks .
who owns the boat ?
he -- uh , that would be me .
why ? is there a problem ?
technically , you can &apos;t store it here ,
and some crazy lady keeps calling .
hi , officer . what &apos;s going on out here ?
wait , you guys narc &apos;d on us !
no , i brought you banana bread !
it was her !
now who &apos;s the narc ?
claire , that &apos;s pretty uncool .
super uncool ! you guys are lame !
i &apos;m also gonna have to write up these rvs .
oh no .
what ? no .
i &apos;m holding . i &apos;m making a walk for it .
