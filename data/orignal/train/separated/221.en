I found your book.
If I ever show it to anyone,
it'll guarantee my outsider status forever.
I'm sure once it's published, the author will come forward.
There's a certain someone that might actually like
the way she's painted, and I'm not talking about serena.
Blair, we kept us a secret
'cause we were afraid there was something more.
Dan and I have a real connection.
That is, until a prince came along.
Being together means going against my family,
and if I'm going to take a stand,
I need to know for certain that you feel as I do.
Will you marry me?
You are cousin Charlie?
Well, wait. What about your trust fund?
Why haven't you gotten it yet?
I have to say it was a pretty devious plan.
Thank you, Ivy. You played your part perfectly.
What we have is a great love.
No matter what we do and how much we fight,
It'll always pull us in.
I should find Louis and tell him it's over.
We need to talk.
When I need to tell you is--
What she's trying to say is, you have my blessing.
This is your chance at happiness.
You deserve your fairy tale.
It's taking all the power I have
to walk away from you.
But I need to let you go.
Being alone is just what I need.
No boys, no bars. Just a bottle of sun block
and a dozen of the best beach reads.
Are you turning "The beautiful and damned" Into a movie?
I got an idea. We got the beautiful and the damned.
So this is not your assignment now.
I always know it's serious
when even you know you can't dull the pain.
Just spin the globe and pick a point.
Bachelors who don't have to answer to anybody.
what is it?
God, you're such a swan in this light.
Cut! Perfect! Print.
Okay, one thing I wanted to say. That was great.
Loosen up. Enjoy it a little bit.
Just 'cause you're in white tie
doesn't mean you can't be dirty and drunk.
That's how these people were back then.
You know what I'm saying? They were having a good time.
So don't make it stiff. You know, enjoy it a little bit.
Uh, the "New York Times" called and wants a quote
on the decision to set the movie
on the days of the crash of '29.
But I told that guy I don't wanna do that
unless I first get the e-mail from Sue Zucconi.
Okay.
Hi. Hey, serena. How are you?
Good. How are you, David? Good to see you.
Thanks.
Oh, no, no. It's okay. I got it. You're busy.
But then who would answer the phones in the production office?
I had the calls forwarded to my cell.
Well, if you're hands-free,
all the better to collate the revisions
and the production team's drafts.
Marshall, remember when you said
that I could observe filming one day before the shoot was over?
Shoot's not over till next week.
Serena?
Thank you.
Dad! What are you doing here?
I thought you'd still be in London,
helping Jenny set up at Saint Martins.
Oh, she and Eric kicked me out
when I didn't know who Sarah Burton was,
So I came back here early,
and thought I'd spend some time with you.
Well, happy to have you.
Yeah. I popped by Cece's. This was waiting.
Maybe it's important. It's from the city.
It's, uh, Blair's "Save the date""
You're not happy. You guys are still friends, right?
Yeah. Friends.
Wonder if she invited Chuck.
If he's anywhere that Fedex can reach...
Hi. I don't believe we've met.
I'm Nate Archibald.
And, uh, you are?
Waiting for me.
How was your nap?
Great. You were gone.
内特尼尔·阿齐布尔德收
It's the only time I can sleep.
Why didn't you take someone with you for a change?
Anything for me?
Nope.
Well, if you hear anything crazy,
it means I'm doing something right.
How does it feel to be home?
Oh, it's gonna be tough reacclimating,
after living in a palace, how will a penthouse do?
But maybe we should skip the wedding planning
and pull the blinds and just spend the day in bed?
We did that all summer.
But we can't put off our parents any longer.
Would a present help motivate you downstairs?
How did you know just what I was missing? Oh!
Shall I wear it to your uncle's speech
at the general assembly tomorrow?
Unfortunately, you will not be allowed inside
until you are an official member of the royal family.
Consider yourself lucky.
Albert's speeches are stronger than Ambien.
I do consider myself lucky.
I'm living a fairy tale.
But no heroine gets her happy ending
without overcoming some obstacles,
and this wedding will be no exception.
A civil service and a religious ceremony?
Who has ever heard of such a thing?!
Our guests will be sitting
longer than a Terrence Malick movie.
I'm your rock.
You can count on me.
How did you guys end up here?
And--and whose boat is this?
This is Allegra Versace's.
Chuck won it in a poker game in Chiang Mai.
He won Allegra, too, but, uh, that's another story.
Wow. So--so he's okay then?
Ask him yourself.
Serena.
Usually when you smile like this,
you look like a creepy Cheshire cat,
but this one is real.
What is your secret? And if it's legal, I want some.
It's not a substance. It's a state of mind. A word.
Well, let me guess-- a dirty word.
"Yes""
Yes, it's a dirty word?
The word is "Yes." I say it at anything.
If an opportunity presents itself, I take it.
There's nothing I won't try once, even happiness.
Mm, he's very inspiring.
I've been saying all summer he should run an infomercial.
You mock, but if someone gave me the opportunity, I'd say--
Yes. Yeah, I think I get it.
I don't think you do.
See, you've been working all summer
in your little assistant's job,
Driving a cart, getting coffee, sorting things.
Isn't there something more you want out of it?
Actually, the producer, Jane, who I really admire,
asked me my thoughts on a scene.
And I was really excited to write something up,
but then Marshall, who's technically my supervisor,
got wind of it and, uh...
He wasn't a huge fan of the idea.
What, so you never did it?
Well, no, I placated Marshall,
so now Jane probably thinks I'm a flake.
There's still time.
Go say the "Yes" you never said.
You know what? You--you are actually right.
And even if you are completely delusional,
if it makes you look this good, I will find Jane tomorrow,
Marshall be damned.
Who wants to go with me
to make sure I actually go through with it?
I know what you're gonna say.
Daniel.
Hey. I was thinking about you just yesterday, old boy.
Read an advanced copy
of a story that "Vanity Fair's" running in their next issue.
Reminded me of your work,
only... better.
Who wrote it?
That's the thing. No one knows.
Totally anonymous. And everyone's talking about it.
What's the story about?
Ah, it's a little Wharton and a lot Wolfe.
The modern mores and misdoings of upper crust Manhattan.
I thought of you because
the protagonist's name was Dylan Hunter, of all things.
The initials being what they are...
I'm sorry, Jeremiah. I gotta--I gotta run.
I see from your list of demands, Blair...
Demands?
That you would like to have peonies in your bridal bouquet.
They're my favorite flower.
And they are very beautiful, but...
In our country, a bride always walks with carnations.
Hmm. To the nearest florist and demands a refund.
I'll be holding peonies.
Aren't I, Louis?
Louis?
With you looking so beautiful,
who will even notice the flowers?
Oh, "Vogue paris" would like to have a photo
of you in your wedding dress for their November issue.
Obviously, this is a very big deal as--
as "Vogue paris" is perhaps
the best thing to happen to the world ever.
Well, I know this is very short notice,
but not to worry,
because my dress is already on the plane here.
Your dress?
Everybody has been married in this dress,
from my great-grandmother on down.
Louis, I've already lost
on the food, the flowers, and the font.
You know how important choosing my dress is for me.
But this is a dress for a royal.
You'll love mama's dress. I-I promise.
I can't wait to see you in it.
How about some cold prosecco to kill the pain?
This just in.
Due to a reader's dumpster dive
outside a well-known fifth avenue prewar,
it appears someone we know and love is in the family way.
So this is your humble gossip girl
issuing an A.P.P.B.
Who could the mother of our next scandal be?
What's wrong, Dorota?
Nothing. Uh, nothing at all.
Prosecco?
No, thank you.
I think I need all my wits for the next round.
Oh, no, it's okay.
I gave up drinking at the beginning of summer.
You know, L.A. lifestyle.
Come on. You guys need one.
Cheers.
At least this secret is bound to show itself soon.
The first meeting was a disaster, S.
He conceded to Sophie on everything.
Oh, it was so out of control,
you would've thought he was Italian.
Well, finding a balance between your mother and your fiancee
has gotta be tough.
I'm sure he's just trying to keep the peace the best he can.
Stop being so rational and trying to see both sides.
I haven't even told you the worst part yet.
They want me to wear Sophie's dress.
Not just on the day,
but in "Vogue Paris," too.
Hand-me-downs are for charity and second children,
not for the bride on her wedding day.
Louis knows how upset I am.
He said he'd talk to Sophie, but... I don't know.
B., first of all, "Vogue paris"--that's amazing!
And you're gonna look beautiful in whatever you wear,
which should be Sophie's gown.
That way, she has a gorgeous photo of you
looking exactly how she wants,
and that way you have more leverage
to wear your own dress on the real day.
See, this is why I wish you were here.
Aren't you done out there?
Los Angeles is a plastic surgery layover,
not somewhere you live.
Serena, your guests just came through the gate.
Okay, thank you. I'll be right there.
B., I love you and I miss you, too.
All right. Tomorrow, same time?
Today we did me, so we can do you?
Of course. You're on my schedule.
Aw. Listen to you, all professional.
Bye.
Miss Blair, have you seen "Gossip girl" Lately?
No.
We need to discuss something...
something affecting both our futures.
The only thing affecting our futures
is your inability to clear a table fast enough.
It appears that Louis has spoken to Sophie.
I need to look my best for my first royal apology.
Here you go.
Thank you.
And do you mind telling Jane that I need to talk to her?
I know they're on lunch.
Sure.
I don't remember approving a set visit for your friends.
You must be Marshall.
And who are you?
He's Chuck Bass.
Hey, so the stuntman's prepped for the fall.
Can you, uh, ask David to meet me by the bag
to talk to the double?
What's the stunt?
I could show you.
You know what I have to say.
Then go.
I have to find David. I'll tell Jane you stopped by.
Get back to work.
Well, the zip codes may be different,
but douche bags are the same no matter where you go.
But now he's gone. Go find Jane.
Okay, what are you gonna do?
Hey, S. Is this my noon audition?
Yes.
Wait.
Are you kidding me? You're kidding me.
You're gonna be great.
Yeah, I'll totally hold.
Thanks, Epperly.
I don't get it. Why would Vanessa steal your story?
Oh, to teach me a lesson.
Let's just, uh, hope I'm wrong,
which...
I'm not.
Did Gabriela ever call you back?
You think maybe Jenny's heard from Vanessa?
Why would she call Jenny?
Yeah, yeah, I'm--I'm here.
Okay.
Thank you.
Epperly's friend at "Vanity Fair"
says all he knows is Graydon Carter read the story
and decided to run it.
Oh, that's pretty cool, right?
I mean, "Vanity fair"'s gonna publish your writing?
If only they were doing it because of my writing.
I mean, they--they think it's about a celebrity.
Really? Why?
Oh, because it's about a celebrity, kind of.
Uh, Blair Waldorf, future princess of Monaco.
I wrote it in the spring, after she and I...
What?
Where you going?
To find the one person
what can help me stop this before it's too late.
It's okay. I accept.
Accept what?
Your apology.
You didn't talk to your mother.
It's just so hard to say no to her.
I worry she'll make things more difficult later
if she doesn't get her way right now.
I'm trying to ease her into our future.
The future is here.
We're gonna be married in three months.
I need to know that we're in this together,
and I'm not just standing here alone.
You're not. I'm right here.
Those are just words.
I need proof.
You're right.
The dress discussion can wait until tomorrow.
But tonight, I show my mother that you come first.
Be ready at 6:00.
Ready for what?
You will be on my arm at the general assembly gala.
I thought there was a rule.
It's about to be broken.
What do you say?
This isn't right. These two walls need to be white.
Serena. Are you looking for Marshall?
No. You, actually.
I hope it's to tell me
why you didn't follow up after our first meeting.
I didn't scare you away, did I?
No. No, no, no. Not at all.
I just didn't want to step on Marshall's toes.
Why not? Keeping on them is what David hired you to do.
If it weren't for you,
he wouldn't have even read the book.
And it was his thoughtful comparison of the book to the script
that's helped keep all of the departments focused.
But I-I did that the first week.
If I would've known he was doing it, too, I...
I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble.
Please don't...
No one's in trouble.
A little reminder that things don't go unnoticed never hurts.
What would you say to a little more responsibility,
See how you do with it?
I'd say...
Yes.
Jane just called, gave me the rest of the day off.
Said I was taking too long to finish her task list
and that I should leave the rest to you.
Looks like things really do come easy to Serena Van der Woodsen,
just like I heard.
But if you think you can do my job better than I can,
here's the test.
"Pull tomorrow's sides,
"update phone sheet, take dogs to groomer,
write coverage of Eugenides."
This isn't so bad. How long did she give you to do this?
Till tomorrow.
Okay, well, I'll have it done by the party later.
Well, I hope I don't see you there.
Oh, you will. Wait. Have you seen my friends?
Hey, get down from there!
Guys. Guys. G--
You're about to be in a lot of trouble,
but I get the feeling you don't care.
You free tonight?
I am now.
Oh! I forgot to ask you. How was the audition?
Well, after I told them I wasn't an actor,
They said, "That's too bad, because you'd be perfect
as a kid from an east coast political family
who's constantly manipulated
while trying to keep everyone around him happy."
They told me that.
You should've said, "Yes!" I mean it.
If there was still in Oprah, she would've been all over that.
Oh, I like Gayle.
Me, too.
So by the way, thank you for letting me use your card.
If you hadn't been here,
I don't know how I would've gotten this task done--
which I'm sure was Marshall's intention.
Hey, gotta love California's laws.
Oh, by the way,
does Patrick Roberts have glaucoma or something?
Like a--like a little nervous twitch?
Who knows? It was the last thing on the list.
"Get Patrick his medicinal weed."
I wonder which one he'll want--
Blueberry headband,
Dragon of shaolin, or sushi Friday?
Headband's pretty good...
From what I've heard from people telling me that it's good.
No, no judgment. I'm just curious why you need it.
It's not like cruising around on a yacht is stressful.
Uh, no, I know that, okay? But doing nothing
has given me a lot of time to think, you know?
And maybe the last couple years are starting to take their toll on me,
between my family, Juliet...
Raina, you.
I mean, sometimes I wish I could just reinvent myself, you know?
Well, you've come to the right place.
Everyone in Hollywood reinvents themselves.
I mean, look at me.
I have gone from "It" Girl to working girl
in just 3,000 miles.
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.
Look, if you're sick of being you,
be someone else for a while.
Yeah, and just where do you suppose that I do that?
At the party we earned our way into tonight.
What do you say?
My, don't you look lovely!
Miss Blair go to U.N.
With Louis and the princess?
I-I-I thought it wasn't proper.
It isn't. Miss Blair testing prince.
Louis told me he would stand up to his mother tonight.
So if he does, everything can continue the way it's meant to.
And if he doesn't, he and his mother will have
a lovely wedding in November without a bride.
Or she could just take my place,
which seems to be what she wants.
Wish me luck.
Darling, is the stress of the wedding getting to you?
Testing a good man who loves you never ends well.
Nothing is getting to me, mother.
I am a Waldorf woman.
I need to know I still have a voice
and that voice is heard.
Now I'm gonna go wait for Louis downstairs.
I swear,
sometimes I don't know where she gets it from.
Louis.
Dan.
Hey. Uh, listen, I-I really need your help.
I wrote a story
that this magazine is publishing in their next issue,
and I really don't want them to.
I have no idea how to stop it,
but I-I figured, you know,
if you put your royal weight behind it,
it could be dead in an hour.
I'm sorry. I have an event I'm late for.
Blair is--
Blair is the one the story's about.
I swear to you, if this story ever sees the light of day,
you are not gonna be happy.
You ready to go?
I thought your text said you were bringing a friend.
Oh, Marilu got a ride with Patrick Roberts.
She goes wherever he goes anyway.
Why? Are they together?
No, she's his minder from the bond company.
He has to stay sober, or the film gets shut down.
Luckily, you and I don't.
But you won't be needing that helmet. I brought my truck.
Riding Mulholland can be pretty dangerous,
and that's where the party is.
Well, I'll throw this inside.
Stick and stones may just break bones,
but the wounds from words never heal...
Especially when they're words we hoped we'd never read.
On second thought,
I'm sure I could ride carefully.
Nothing's that dangerous, right?
Here you go.
Oh, you can't possibly--
have finished? She did.
Everything?
Well, technically, there's still one thing left.
Have you see Patrick?
Yeah, outside by the pool.
This is your chance.
What are you talking about?
Come on. You're at a party
all the way across the country from your real life,
where no one knows your name.
Who do you wanna be?
No. No, I'm pretty sure that's not how it works. All right?
Oh, my God. Are you that guy-- that guy from that movie?
Uh... yes.
I love that guy. Can we have your autograph?
Yeah.
Do you live in L.A.?
Yes.
Is that your Maybach in the driveway?
Yeah.
This is your house?
Yes.
How about a tour?
Yes. Absolutely.
Uh, this is a private tour.
My, my.
If it isn't New York's finest.
Nice to see you out and about for once.
Thanks, Patrick. It's good to be out.
Hey, I, um, have something for you.
What are you doing?
Production sent me for it.
Well, that is awesome.
Marilu said it was cool?
Well, I-I guess.
Have fun?
I will now.
I can't even believe I'm answering this call.
I'm so sorry, Blair. Something's come up
that's taking me longer than anticipated.
Now it looks like I won't make it to the gala at all.
You're going with "vague" on this one?
"Something's come up"?
Why don't you just admit that
you're already in the U.N. with your mother
instead of lying?
I'm not. I wish I could tell you where I am,
but I made a promise.
And we know how you honor the promises you make,
as long as they're not to me.
Tell your mother congratulations. She won.
What are you talking about?
Call down to Jimmy and tell him to get me a cab.
Where are you going?
Do you collect?
Yes.
A Helmut Newton, right?
Yes.
Is that Lauren Hutton?
Yes.
Or is it Lisa Taylor?
Yes. How'd you know?
Mm, I have a good eye...
and good taste.
Is this the master bedroom?
Let's destroy it.
How is the score going?
Uh, well, we've almost finished the key theme.
And we've been listening to that Leonard Cohen score
that he did for "Mccabe & Mrs. Miller" for inspiration.
I'm sorry. Would you two excuse me just for a minute?
Is everything okay?
Marshall just informed me
that he found Patrick with some pot,
which luckily he was able to confiscate
before disaster struck.
Disaster?
Marilu's from the insurance company.
The movie only keeps its completion bond
if Patrick stays sober.
If she found out he broke his sobriety,
she'd have to shut the movie down.
I can't imagine how he got his hands on it.
Well, I'm gonna go get Patrick. He'll tell us.
He is scared out of mind at what he almost did.
Excuse me.
Oh, thank god. I was...
Blair?
Hey, what are you doing here? Did Louis, uh...
Uh, I didn't know where else to go.
I wasn't gonna come here.
I hadn't talked to you all summer, and...
you're the only person I know in New York right now,
and I really need a friend,
if you're still...
Of course I am. What's going on?
I am about to call off my engagement.
I can't marry someone
who doesn't stand up for me, not even to his own mother.
And... when I tell him it's over,
I'll need to get away, to clear my head.
You were in the Hamptons?
Uh, Amagansett. Cece's house.
Is it empty?
Take me there.
Okay.
Uh, we can, uh, we can take my dad's car.
You'll call Louis from there.
I'll be there with you,
for whatever you need.
Often, all it takes to find a new path
is to make a sharp turn and see what you find.
You gotta take it easy up here.
People write songs about wiping out on our L.A. roadways.
I'm not scared.
Well, you should be.
I'm not scared of anything.
But beware.
Sometimes what you're faced with is a dead end.
Oh, my god. Are you okay?
I'm perfect. You see any blood anywhere?
I could use a glass of Scotch, however.
Should we walk or should I drive you on yours?
Okay, I know I don't know you at all,
and you probably could give a damn about what I have to say.
Most of the people in my business are in it
because they're thrill-seekers or adrenaline junkies.
But for some of them,
there's something darker going on.
I think you need help.
I said I'm fine.
Well, that may be, but...
this date is over.
Good luck, Chuck.
Thank you.
My best friend was right.
Saying "Yes" makes everything better.
Well, based on my own recent experience, I've have to agree.
Now it's time for you to leave.
Well, if that's how you want to be about it, okay.
But it is my house.
Don't you think you should be the one to go?
Actually, this is my house.
And just so you know, this isn't the master bedroom.
It's a guest room-- the smallest one.
Nice to meet you, by the way, um...
Nate.
Mm. That's a great name.
Uh, and you are?
Done now.
How could you do this to me?
You think I didn't know what you were up to?
Try to tell me that doing everything on Jane's list
wasn't just to show me up.
So you decided to add a few tasks that could get me fired,
not to mention shut down the movie?
I didn't think you could actually come through.
I thought you'd have to tell Jane you couldn't finish.
I need this job more than you do, okay?
I pay for my life.
I have student loans, rent, a car lease.
I can't afford to get fired.
And I can?
You're Serena van der Woodsen.
You do one lap around this party,
you'll get ten job offers.
You weren't even looking when you found this one.
In two weeks, when you're at college,
will you even look back at this as anything more
than that thing you did that summer?
This is my career.
I haven't found him yet, but when I do...
Marilu, wait.
What's going on?
I'm the one that gave Patrick the pot.
And he only took it because I told him production okayed it.
Someone played a joke on me,
and if I wasn't so intent on proving my worth,
I-I wouldn't have fallen for it, but...
I did.
I'm sorry.
You can tell Jane I'll clear out my desk in the morning.
I don't understand, Louis. Are you following me now?
No, Blair.
Actually...
It's fine if you are,
because I can do this in person then.
No, Louis is not here... for you.
He's not?
What the hell is going on?
Louis didn't meet you tonight
because he was helping me.
Helping you what?
Last spring, I-I-I wrote a story about you,
and due to a series of unfortunate events,
that story is going to be published.
Was... going to be.
Was.
Uh, I asked, and Louis kindly obliged to...
help me kill it before it came out
so it wouldn't embarrass you, and that's exactly what he did.
He really is your prince.
It may not have been standing up to his mother,
but it was protecting you against the world.
You gotta understand,
I didn't ever think anyone would read it.
You let me almost walk away from everything tonight.
And all the while, you knew exactly where Louis was,
exactly what he was doing for me.
How could you let that happen?
Why would you?
What possible reason could you have?
Lonely boy learning three words, eight letters
don't come out right when no one wants to hear them.
Come on, Louis. Let's go.
I'm done here.
Hey, are you happy?
We decided what we wanted,
went after it like you said, and look what happened.
Yes, look. Serena,
You accepted responsibility without hesitation
for maybe the first time in your life.
And, Nate, you had more fun not being you
than you've ever had actually being you,
which means you now know you need to change.
Is it just me, or is what he's saying actually making sense?
Maybe we're not awake yet.
We're growing up.
We need to start being responsible for ourselves
instead of always being responsible for others.
What, you knew?
Nate, I know you think I must be dying inside
because Blair is marrying another man.
But we let each other go.
So stop doing stuff like this and start focusing on yourself.
And you.
Though this part of your journey may have come to an end,
it shows you there's a world out there you never knew existed,
one you want to be part of.
Have you ever thought of writing a book?
People like me don't write books. We're written about.
Okay, I should go clean out my desk.
Yep. I should probably get outta here, too.
I'm pretty sure I left my phone at the party last night,
and while I'm at it,
I should probably apologize to the hostess.
I'll stay here alone with my genius.
Come here. Ah.
Too close. Too close.
Don't be shy. Don't be shy. Don't be shy.
What?
No, is it my hair?
I didn't want to say anything in front of Louis,
but I found something
hidden in the pantry.
Is this why you have been acting so strange about Louis?
Is there something you need to tell me?
Is me who needs to confess.
Baby number two on way.
This is what you needed to tell me yesterday
that would affect our future?
Yes. I-I just want to tell you first,
but you were away,
and it not right to text "Hello, pregnant!"
And--and then you were back, but you did not let me speak,
and so now news comes out this way.
At least news out.
And "Gossip girl" talk about me. I feel so special.
Congratulations!
Well, well, well, upper east siders.
I got my answer after all,
and it turns out the only thing expanding
at the Waldorf residence is the help.
Yet all this talk about expecting
has got me thinking about expectations.
I had no idea I was gonna meet him out here,
I didn't expect to make contact till New York.
But something tells me
I'm gonna see him again even sooner than I imagined.
Oh, much sooner.
Call you later.
You must be here for this.
Yes. Thank you.
And listen, I know you don't know really know me at all,
but I feel like I owe you an apology
for pretending to be someone else.
And I only did it because I'm just now starting to realize
that, well, I don't really know who I am.
Anyway, I'm sorry,
but I still had a lot of fun with you.
As did I. And I accept.
Who knows? Maybe we'll see each other around sometime.
Yeah.
Good-bye.
Bye.
You wanted to see me?
Yes. There's a whole load of things
I need done on my list this morning.
Oh, I-I guess you didn't hear.
I heard. Marilu told me.
"The beautiful and the damned" wraps in a week,
but how would you like to keep working for me?
You're the first one in every morning,
the last one to leave every night.
I need someone with your dedication and fire.
Although you might want to check with me
the next time one of my tasks seems a little off-the-wall.
Yeah.
Well, what do you say?
I would love to.
Hey. What's going on?
Lily has another meeting with the decorator.
She's redecorated so many times, it looks exactly the same.
I keep telling Andy Cohen he should make a show about her
called "The real house arrests of New York."
Well, you can, uh, hang here with me,
help me with this mail.
Good, because I have some time
before the 9/11 memorial 10th anniversary album launch.
Oh, and by the way, your story was amazing.
Thanks for letting me read it. I'm just a little bit confused.
I-I expected something negative about Blair,
but in fact, it was quite the opposite.
Why was it so important that no one read it?
Did you make it to the end?
Well, I assumed that was artistic license.
Did... that actually happen?
Mm. A writer never tells.
So now I just have to make sure that
the book that chapter comes from never sees the light of day.
There's a whole book?
Well, don't get too excited. I'm hoping, uh,
Vanessa only leaked the one chapter to the magazine,
since that's all they had.
Oh, look.
Air mail from Barcelona.
The thing about expectations
is most of the time, someone else sets them for you,
Yet you feel like they've been there all along
and you can't wait to live up to them.
You ready to go?
I'm not coming. Guess why.
Jane offered me a job.
What did you say?
I said yes!
Really? That's great.
oh, thank you.
I mean, it wouldn't have happened without you two.
How about now?
Your new L.A. Lifestyle ready to make an exception?
Well, I think so. Pop it open.
Of course that happened.
There's--there's a bathroom in the dressing room right there.
I'll be right back.
Just... come on.
But just because you know what's expected of you
doesn't mean you still can't surprise everyone.
Blair...
you look beautiful.
Of course she does.
Mother, Blair is not carrying those.
And there are some other things
I need to talk to you about, too.
Do they know?
Know what?
How far along you are.
I'd say... six weeks?
They sent me your measurements.
Well, you obviously can't read,
or they were wrong when you got them...
Because I'm not pregnant.
Lie to me all you want,
but your body will be telling the whole world the truth
by the time of your wedding.
Nothing stays hidden for long.
The one month anniversary of our move.
It's crazy.
What's crazy is if your uncle hadn't left you
that tiny bit of money, we never would've left Miami.
I just hope you don't mind working a crap job with me
till we figure stuff out.
No, I'm just glad to be away from there.
Ivy, stop talking to your boyfriend and start working.
You're late.
Don't get fired. We need the cash.
Charlie!
And you often find what you least expect
is right in front of you...
Oh, my gosh!
Serena?
Waiting to change everything forever.
What are you doing here?
Oh, what am I doing here? What are you doing here?
Ivy. Ivy, your shift.
That was weird.
Um, let's get out of here.
Yeah, let's go. Okay.
Whether you want to or not.
So good to see you.
It's good to see you.
