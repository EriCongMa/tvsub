i love a good nor &apos;easter .
i would love to meet the person who installed this roof .
what are you doing here so early ?
traffic &apos;s terrible .
maura , headquarters is , like , less than a mile away .
well , i was reviewing protocols for hope &apos;s clinics ,
and i was hoping to drop them off before work .
and ... voil√£ .
for you for tomorrow night .
tomorrow night ? what &apos;s tomorrow night ?
oh , no . you are not getting out of it .
getting out of what ?
the minuteman mystery writers conference .
you promised .
yes ! that &apos;s tomorrow night . fantastic .
it &apos;ll be fun .
you know , there &apos;s a panel discussion on dramatic theory .
and i really believe that the insight
of professional writers will improve my understanding
of internal structure better .
i haven &apos;t decided yet whether or not aristotle &apos;s &quot; poetics &quot; or --
what if it gets rained out ?
it &apos;s inside .
oh , great ! rizzoli .
isles .
jennie tate , 32 .
what is a patient doing in here ?
and frankly , where the hell is here ?
here is a new cancer wing .
whole building &apos;s been closed for four months for renovation .
jennie was an overnight chemotherapy patient
in the adjoining building .
a nurse came in and changed her iv at 3 : 45 this morning .
when she looked in on her again at 6 : 45 , jennie was gone .
right around the time the workers found her .
she may have been exercising .
you know , a recent article in the &quot; journal of oncology &quot; suggests
that moderate exercise can improve the effects of chemotherapy .
any reports of her going for a walk ?
no .
any cameras ?
no cameras , and no one saw her leave the ward .
we have lights coming .
the impalement appears to be the only injury .
you know , she may have fallen , but i can &apos;t be sure until i --
until you perform the autopsy .
very funny , but true .
what &apos;s with the white rose ? was she carrying that ?
no one i interviewed mentioned it .
find out if there were roses in jennie &apos;s room .
if there were , find out who sent &apos; em .
jane .
frankie said jennie didn &apos;t have flowers in her room .
what about the other patients ?
no flowers .
so where &apos;d this white rose come from ?
push the button .
push the button . push the button .
why ?
&quot; cause he &apos;s right behind me .
who ?
who ?
him !
oh ! hey . wait .
uh , sorry .
you &apos;re running from him because he invited you to a concert ?
yes . i went to his house for what he called &quot; the big game . &quot;
do you know he does taxidermy ?
taxidermy ?
oh , yeah . little mice .
he even has a favorite -- st . kilda .
all right , well , i mean , you know , that &apos;s ...
odd , but harmless .
he dresses them up in seasonal costumes .
skiing , surfing , leaf raking .
back to the game . sox ?
the national shinty championships .
kent was wearing a jersey and a kilt .
well , special occasional , championship and all .
yeah . that &apos;s -- that &apos;s normal .
he had one for me .
a jersey ?
i wish .
at least he didn &apos;t have one for his mouse .
wrong again , friend .
oh , yeah .
come on .
detective rizzoli , there &apos;s a woman here with information
about the homicide at the hospital .
okay . um , where is she ? the interview room ?
interrogation room . interview room &apos;s flooded .
all right , thanks .
samantha caspary ?
hi . i &apos;m detective rizzoli . this is sergeant --
what can you tell me about the murder at the mallon hospital ?
... detective korsak .
was she a patient ?
where was the body found ? was she thrown from the roof ?
are you a relative or a friend ?
what ? no . no , no .
so , what is your interest in this case ?
so sorry . i tend to get carried away .
i &apos;m in town for the mystery writers conference .
so you &apos;re a writer .
yes , which is why when i heard about your case ,
i just had to come in .
okay . um ...
we don &apos;t do interviews .
so i &apos;ll , uh , get an officer and he &apos;ll escort you ...
but i can help you ...
... to the front .
... if you just tell me about the case .
uh , i think you &apos;re a little bit confused .
we ask the questions .
how is it exactly you think you can help us ?
i know who did it .
you do .
the victim was impaled , right ?
and the killer left flowers behind .
just cut to the chase , ms . caspary .
you are looking for a ghost .
as the story goes , hannah rose was a patient at the hospital .
angered by her untimely death ,
she came back as a ghost and killed several people .
how many is several ?
i don &apos;t know .
i heard the story secondhand .
actually , it might &apos;ve been third @-@ hand
on a visit to the u.s. long time ago .
and i was told that the doctor who was treating the patients
was found impaled on an iron post .
multiple murders , a ghost killer --
sounds like something i would &apos;ve heard about ,
but i haven &apos;t .
nobody has ,
which is why it &apos;s too much of a coincidence
to be ... coincidence .
okay , i &apos;ll have someone look into the story .
great .
i can &apos;t find anything in writing ,
and the mallon hospital
won &apos;t let me anywhere near their archives .
so you thought you &apos;d come to us
and we &apos;d look in the archives for you ?
well , i must confess , i was rather hoping
that my information would help you ,
and you would return the favor .
anything helpful from the caspary woman ?
oh , yeah , if we &apos;re looking for the headless horseman
or if we &apos;re gonna take a ride in the mystery machine ?
no .
okay , what have we got so far ?
well , jennie tate was a data entry clerk
with an insurance company .
now because of her illness ,
she was on extended sick leave for the last six months .
husband ?
charles . he &apos;s an actuary with the same company .
co @-@ worker said they were good , hard @-@ working people .
what about the hospital ?
no threats or any other violent incidents .
nina &apos;s still running background on the employees .
will you have nina check the other patients
in jennie &apos;s chemotherapy group ?
yeah .
all right .
those archives could hold the key to a fascinating story .
that might be true , but this is a homicide investigation ...
hi . you looking for me ?
no .
you &apos;ve got samantha caspary .
samantha caspary , potential crazy person .
oh , no , no , no . she is an author with a phd from oxford .
wrote a captivating best @-@ selling biography on dr. joseph bell .
the scottish lecturer
who was the inspiration for sherlock holmes .
if i say , &quot; wow , i &apos;d really love to read that , &quot;
can we talk about the case ?
jennie tate was in partial remission .
her cancer was responding to a rather new combination of drugs .
did the drugs cause her death ?
the drug levels in her blood
were well below fatal toxicity levels .
also , there was no evidence of sexual assault .
and the degree of blunt force trauma
is consistent with a fall .
what about that giant piece of iron bar sticking out of her chest ?
did that have anything to do with her death ?
well , technically , that was the instrumentality ,
but the cause of death was drowning .
the bar pierced her pulmonary artery ,
her lungs filled with blood , and she drowned .
could this have been an accident ?
well , those drugs do produce a mild state of disorientation .
so it seemed possible , until i noticed this .
these small lacerations couldn &apos;t be seen earlier
because they didn &apos;t bleed .
these are from the rose .
yes .
so our killer watched jennie die
and then pressed her hand around the rose .
it &apos;s not an accident or a ghost .
excuse me . dr. isles ?
yes .
i &apos;m santha caspary .
i know who you are . it is a pleasure to meet you .
i &apos;ve always wanted to meet you .
i do hope i &apos;m not being too forward ,
but do you have time for a coffee ?
i really don &apos;t .
of course . you must be so busy .
it &apos;s just that i have read so many of your forensic papers .
really ?
oh , yes .
your paper on the effect of immersion on the rate of decay
could &apos;ve been a short story .
do you do any other kind of writing ?
well , i have written a few short stories
for my creative writing class .
aha . well , i &apos;m here for the writers conference .
maybe we could meet for dinner or drinks ?
i could pick your brain , and you can show me your short stories .
i &apos;d love that .
ultrasound to radiology ...
our killer used this building &apos;s history to cover a murder .
i cannot understand how people believe in ghosts .
they &apos;re just trying to deal with the finality of death .
probably understand it a lot more
if they saw what we saw every day .
oh , that might be too much understanding .
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s crazy
to believe in a certain life force
that doesn &apos;t die with a physical body .
oh , i didn &apos;t know you and kiki joined a cult .
that &apos;s pretty strong words for someone who followed
the departed barry frost all over town .
i just saw him &apos; cause i wanted to see him .
or maybe it &apos;s that energy i &apos;m talking about .
we &apos;ve all felt it one time or another ,
whether we want to admit it or not .
i miss him .
me , too .
jennie tate was part of a cancer drug program
that mallon hospital recently agreed to underwrite .
we understand that she was in remission .
she was one of our first success stories .
and we all feel terrible about the incident .
it wasn &apos;t an incident , ms. najafi . it was a homicide .
a homicide ?
yes . what did you think happened ?
i don &apos;t know , a @-@ a terrible accident .
we &apos;re gonna need jennie &apos;s medical records ,
the hospital security log , list of all employees .
i need to call our legal department .
while you &apos;re at it , could you tell them we also need
their records of any lawsuits pending ,
any threats against the hospital or staff ?
anything that would make the hospital a target for revenge .
wait . you think this could have something to do
with the hospital ?
we do .
are you familiar with the hateful hannah story ?
one of our senior board members told me that ridiculous tale .
can we speak to him , please ?
he &apos;s no longer with us .
do you know where we can find him ?
i &apos;m sorry . i mean , he died .
like i said , he was a senio board member .
does anybody else know the story ?
i hope not . it could ruin our hospital .
really ? a ghost story ?
please stop saying &quot; ghost . &quot;
in 1905 , that story nearly caused
the financial ruin of this hospital .
that was a long time ago , ms. najafi .
people will come back to a hospital
if they get an infection , sergeant .
in fact , it &apos;s expected .
but no one will come to a haunted hospital .
we &apos;ll be discreet , but we have to check out every lead ,
even if it involves a story none of us believes .
yes ?
a nurse heard screams coming from the renovation site .
our security guard won &apos;t go near it .
to the right ?
shit !
jane .
russell morgan , the oncologist in jennie tate &apos;s treatment .
if someone wanted dr. morgan and jennie tate dead ,
there are easier ways .
why the elaborate scheme ?
to throw suspicion off themselves ,
like blaming cousin larry .
except ghosts don &apos;t exists .
true , which probably means someone &apos;s trying to get back
at the hospital for some reason we haven &apos;t discovered yet .
hey , the construction on the new wing
is three months behind schedule .
well , the contract might &apos;ve had a penalty for late completion .
which would be invalid if the hospital contributed
to the delays because of , oh , i don &apos;t know ,
a murder investigation ?
i &apos;ll look into it first thing in the morning .
hey , frankie , why don &apos;t you and i stay
on jennie tate and dr. morgan ?
can you ask nina to check for any malpractice lawsuits ?
maybe somebody was unhappy with the care they received .
why don &apos;t you just tell kent you don &apos;t want to go ?
it &apos;s not that easy .
kent has this way of making me feel bad .
then go . it &apos;s just a couple hours .
will you go with me ?
no .
you see how easy that was ?
okay . maura is done with dr. morgan &apos;s autopsy .
hey , what do you think about this samantha caspary ?
our nosy writer ?
a few ghost murders would be good for future book sales .
yeah , but why walk in here and tell us about
the ghost stories if she &apos;s the one behind it all ?
maybe the creepy he from the deep told her to do it ,
or maybe she &apos;s just dumber than we think she is .
she gave us an alibi .
she said she was on the train from new york arriving at 7 : 30 .
we &apos;re still confirming it .
but telling a lie that specific would be really dumb .
were you in the room with her ...
okay , i &apos;m gonna see maura .
oh , good .
i wanted to give you the autopsy results before i left .
okay .
overdose .
well , there was a needle mark on the back of his neck ,
which was the injection site for the same cancer drugs
that he was using on his patients .
his heart stopped within seconds of being injected .
who would have access to those drugs ?
i requested an inventory from the hospital ,
but in the meantime , i &apos;m running tests on another theory .
you &apos;re not gonna tell me the theory , are you ?
no , not until the tests are complete .
oh , maura !
i &apos;ve got to go . i &apos;m having drinks with samantha .
samantha ? the woman that thinks that ghosts murder people ?
well , she doesn &apos;t really think that .
i mean , she &apos;s just tracking an interesting story .
okay , &apos; cause she doesn &apos;t seem very ...
what ?
sane .
well , if she &apos;s not crazy , she &apos;s up to something .
all right , well , i &apos;ll be careful .
i love it .
i sense a &quot; but &quot; coming .
no &quot; but . &quot;
i have read published authors
whose first drafts aren &apos;t this polished .
really ?
yes , really .
have you ever thought about trying something longer ?
a novel , perhaps ?
i have .
i would love to put you in touch with my editors .
dessert for my favorite medical examiner and her friend .
double chocolate lava cake . and is that vintage port ?
well , if vintage means
sitting on the shelf for a really long time ?
this is angela , detective rizzoli &apos;s mother .
samantha &apos;s in town for the writer &apos;s conference .
how do you do ?
pleasure to meet you .
i can see where the detective gets her beauty .
oh , i like her .
writer ?
yes . yes .
maura &apos;s a writer .
i write . there &apos;s a difference .
hounds are calling .
are you always this modest ?
no .
but let &apos;s talk about you .
you know , i am amazed at the attention to detail in your stories .
how do you get your inspiration ?
research , research , research .
when i wrote &quot; the detective doctor of edinburgh , &quot;
i moved to edinburgh .
so that i could be completely immersed in his world .
i wanted to write about joseph bell ,
so i learned everything i possibly could
about his father , et cetera .
like hateful hannah .
that ghost story isn &apos;t real .
something happened , and people attached a ghost to it .
i might never know why , but , oh , well .
we can &apos;t always have the answers to our questions , can we ?
i look forward to reading your first novel .
thank you . oh , keep the change .
this storm doesn &apos;t let up soon , i &apos;m buying a bigger boat .
oh , thank you .
any luck running down the fired employees ?
uh , yeah . they all alibied up . uh , what about the contractor ?
oh , he &apos;s not our killer .
guy pays a 15 % penalty for every day over the finish date ,
regardless of the reason .
pretty steep .
and three accidents and two murders
won &apos;t help him keep his crew together either .
what about samantha caspary ?
conductor saw her on the train
the time of jennie tate &apos;s murder .
all right , i &apos;ll tell maura .
oh , no bother . i told her .
she asked me to do a more in @-@ depth background check on her .
oh , yeah ?
yeah , she said she wanted to address your concerns .
you can relax . caspary &apos;s legit .
okay . frankie &apos;s got something .
come on , paddington . let &apos;s go find him .
you looking for me ?
yeah . take a look at this .
we searched through all the legal actions filed against
the mallon hospital in the last five years .
you find anything ? - oh , the usual patient complaints --
insurance coverages , food , rude nurses .
no one with an ax to grind . no credible threats .
so what am i supposed to be looking at ?
this .
so i couldn &apos;t find anyone with a good reason
to hurt jennie tate or dr. morgan .
but we did find a lot of calls between the two of them
over the last couple of months .
nothing unusual there . he was her doctor .
that &apos;s what we thought , too .
then we noticed that her husband , charles ,
never called dr. morgan ...
until ...
the night of his wife &apos;s murder .
could be he was concerned about his wife .
or maybe he just found out about this .
the state road motel ?
this is the guest log from three months ago .
dr. morgan and jennie tate ...
... stayed at the same hotel on the same night .
what are the odds of that ?
pretty damn good if they were having an affair .
just a few things we need to clear up .
okay .
when did you find out your wife was having an affair ?
what ? an -- an affair ?
i don &apos;t hear you denying it .
what the hell are you talking about ?
she -- she had cancer , for god &apos;s sake .
that &apos;s not the point .
that &apos;s enough .
where were you the night your wife died ?
at home until the detectives came
to tell me jennie was dead .
was there anyone there ? someone who can verify that ?
no .
did you go back to the hospital at any point ?
no .
why &apos;d you call dr. morgan that night ?
to check on jennie .
are you sure it wasn &apos;t to confront him
about screwing your wife ?
you think my wife was having an affair with dr. morgan ?
they spent the weekend together in new hampshire .
it happens . the doctor / patient relationship --
it &apos;s a strong bond .
i knew about this . it &apos;s not what you think .
tell me what i should think , charles .
local hospitals wouldn &apos;t approve the use of a new drug cocktail .
too much liability , they said .
so dr. morgan treated jennie at a private clinic
in new hampshire .
until ...
until mallon hospital agreed
to let him give the drugs to his patients .
you were right about one thing , detectives .
my wife did love dr. morgan .
so did i. he was saving her .
i have no idea why they were killed ,
and it seems like you don &apos;t either , so ...
unless i &apos;m under arrest ...
we worked charles tate pretty hard ,
a guy who just lost his wife .
i really hate that part of the job .
so his story checked out ?
yep . back to square one .
all right , well ,
the contractor had no motive .
none of the hospital employees held any grudges .
charles tate didn &apos;t do it .
yeah , so it &apos;s ... it &apos;s gotta be about the hospital .
who would want to shut down a hospital ?
well , whoever it is may have enough of the cancer drugs
to kill at least three more people .
the drugs that killed dr. morgan were from jennie &apos;s iv bag ?
yes , and by my calculations ,
there &apos;s still 150ccs missing from the bag .
that &apos;s enough to kill three people ?
well , in a measured amount such as an iv drip ,
it &apos;s completely safe , but in a concentrated dose ,
it could result in immediate death .
i &apos;ll call the hospital and have them keep an eye
on dr. morgan &apos;s other patients .
so the rose , the impalement ...
somebody has to know the details of this ghost story .
didn &apos;t samantha caspary mention something
about hospital archives ?
i could send a c.s.r.u. team down there .
okay .
if somebody did go through the files from the early 1900s ,
there may be trace evidence .
you know , i might ask samantha caspary to join me .
why ?
well , if there &apos;s no trace evidence ,
it still might make sense to go through the documents .
and her phd was in the evolution of baptism
in the english medieval church .
which means that she &apos;s gone through thousands
of ancient records to build and test her theory .
oh . so you &apos;re saying that she has good research skills
and she &apos;s not allergic to dust .
exactly . and it wouldn &apos;t be the first time i &apos;ve enlisted
an expert &apos;s opinion .
you okay with this ?
sure , as long as she signs a nondisclosure agreement .
even if they find something , she won &apos;t be able to use it .
all right .
done .
this part of the archive
contain medical records from before 1920 .
if someone &apos;s been in here recently ,
my team will know about it .
thank you so much for including me .
we &apos;re finished in here . no fresh latents .
i doubt anyone &apos;s been near those shelves in 20 years .
thank you . i &apos;ll see you back at the lab .
so ... i suppose that &apos;s it .
well , i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said .
the story behind the story ?
exactly .
maybe there is something to the hannah rose case
that relates to the present @-@ day murders .
but there &apos;s no way to really know
unless we go through these files .
are you serious ?
i brought gloves .
frankie ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m trying to avoid kent .
well , if you keep dripping on my bar ,
you can avoid him outside .
why are you avoiding him ?
he wants me to go to a concert with him .
nice . what concert ?
that &apos;s just it . i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t want to spend an entire night
listening to bagpipes and harps .
guy &apos;s weird .
oh , come on . we &apos;re all a little weird .
well , you don &apos;t know the half of it .
well , i know he &apos;s the new kid in town .
he got here a year ago .
and probably doesn &apos;t have a lot of friends , frankie .
that &apos;s on him .
you could be nice to him .
yeah . that &apos;s what nina said .
good advice . you should listen to her .
you remember how i became den mother for the cub scouts ?
yeah . you loved it .
no , i did not love it .
i did that so that at least once a week
you would have some friends .
get out . no way .
frankie , you were a very shy boy .
you had a hard time making friends .
you needed a little help .
how is that helping ?
all these years , i thought those guys were really my friends .
they became your friends once they got to know you .
you just needed a chance .
so you think i should tell kent to join the cub scouts ?
kent gave you a generous offer .
go . enjoy it .
you wouldn &apos;t be saying that if you had to go .
i would , too .
now you came here to eat or complain ?
tuna melt ?
yeah .
fascinating .
when i was researching dr. bell ,
i read a great deal about autopsies from this period .
but to actually hold an autopsy book ...
you &apos;d be surprised how little protocols have changed .
you know , i haven &apos;t found anything pertaining
to this murder / suicide case . have you ?
imagine if the people who wrote these reports
knew that we &apos;d be studying them over a hundred years later .
what would they make
of all the advances in medicine and treatments ?
that &apos;s where the imagination of the novelist
can help fill in the gaps .
do you ever think about how people of the future
will look at the work you do ?
samantha , what are you doing ?
you were right to be suspicious about samantha .
she said all those nice things about my writing
just so i &apos;d trust her .
oh , come on . that can &apos;t be true .
oh . it &apos;s so obvious .
i caught her trying to remove files .
she just used me to get access to the archives .
what &apos;d she try to take ?
a list of the patients that died in 1905 .
she wanted to research the families
and see if they knew anything about hateful hannah .
i &apos;ll have nina run the names on the list ,
but that list is over a hundred years old .
i doubt it has anything to do with our case .
i just feel so foolish .
i ... allowed the flattery to cloud my reason .
so you &apos;re human like the rest of us ?
well , the archives were illuminating , though .
yeah ?
according to the records ,
hannah rose died of typhoid fever .
her doctor was looking for a cure ,
trying various treatments on several patients ,
but none were successful and all the patients died .
what happened to the doctor ?
well , after his patients died , he committed suicide .
but there is no mention of a ghost or roses
anywhere in the archives .
well , the administrator knew all about it .
i mean , she told us about a ghost story
that nearly destroyed the hospital .
well , it was 1905 .
people more readily accepted the supernatural .
and all those deaths all at once and a suicide ,
it would be fertile ground for a ghost story .
i would think that a murderous ghost haunting a hospital
would be somewhat newsworthy .
i agree .
but samantha said she couldn &apos;t find any accounts of the story .
and are we going to believe her on that one ?
well , if she had found something ,
she wouldn &apos;t have come to us .
well , somehow , the killer knows all about it
because they had to throw in the rose
to connect it to hannah rose .
where would they find her name ?
not from the hospital archives .
those records had been undisturbed for many years .
well , with that many deaths and a suicide ,
somebody had to have reported on it .
if we can &apos;t find the article ,
then that means somebody stole it .
no , that &apos;s two z &apos;s . r @-@ i @-@ z @-@ z @-@ o @-@ l @-@ i .
i &apos;m frankie rizzoli junior .
my father is frank rizzoli senior .
you know , this is , like ,
the third time this has happened .
can &apos;t you make a note on the file or something ?
no , no , no , yeah . whatever . i understand .
thank you for your help .
everything okay ?
my father &apos;s having financial problems .
somehow his creditors keep getting my number .
that &apos;s annoying .
yeah .
it &apos;s always something with him , you know ?
maybe it &apos;s just a part of being a rizzoli .
if i have a son ,
he &apos;s probably gonna have to clean up my messes .
don &apos;t do that .
what ?
don &apos;t put yourself down like that .
you &apos;re not like your father . you know that , right ?
yeah , i was just joking .
but i &apos;m not . i knew him . and i know you .
and i know what you &apos;ve grown into the past few years .
you &apos;re a good man and a fine detective .
thank you .
so maybe it &apos;s time to just stop .
stop what ?
stop being frankie junior . you &apos;re not a kid anymore .
well , i &apos;ve always been frankie junior .
doesn &apos;t mean you always have to be ... frank .
kent &apos;s looking for you again .
well , he &apos;s a hard guy to avoid .
then maybe you shouldn &apos;t avoid him .
i &apos;ll call him . i promise .
i bet you &apos;ll have a good time .
sure .
and maybe after the concert ,
you guys could sign up for cub scouts .
i &apos;m gonna disown my mother .
that won &apos;t stop her from telling me
all the cute frankie junior stories .
did you find anything
in the historical document room at the library , scout ?
actually , i did .
turns out a lot of pages were cut out
of the original editions of &quot; the dispatch &quot; from 1905 .
these are the names of people who looked at newspapers
from the early 1900s over the last two months .
any , uh , security cameras in that area of the library ?
no . apparently , they use all their money for white cotton gloves .
this is interesting .
joseph mason . why is he so special ?
he died two years ago ,
but checked into the library last month .
there you are . i &apos;ve been looking for you everywhere .
oh ! wow , yeah .
i &apos;ve been , uh ... i was just about to call you .
i &apos;d love to come . i would love to come , yeah .
what is it ? is it bagpipes or -- or the clear shark ?
clear ...
oh , you mean -- you mean clarsach ? god , no .
you &apos;re not into harp music , are you ?
no , no . i just thought that , you know , you ...
yes !
this is so cool .
um , hey , hey , i , uh ,
i gotta go canvass a building for witnesses .
you got time for a ride @-@ along ?
really ?
yeah !
you sure ?
come on .
oh , that &apos;d be grand . i just need to get my bag from downstairs .
all right .
i &apos;ve got an extra ticket for tonight
if you know anyone else who wants to come along .
oh , i know just the person .
any leads on who might be using the mason library card ?
frankie talked to an old @-@ timer who knew mason .
remembered him as being very frail ,
but he had a caregiver who lived next door -- margery cannon .
margery died six months ago of cancer ,
and her husband died 20 years before that .
i &apos;m getting really tired of all our leads being dead people .
all right .
there were no margery cannon admitted to the mallon hospital .
maybe she was at a different hospital .
she died at st. mary &apos;s .
&quot; survived by her devoted stepson , james miller . &quot;
james miller . james ...
can you pull the list of employees
at the mallon hospital , please ?
yeah . james miller . maintenance department .
a maintenance guy could move around the hospital
and never raise an eyebrow .
yeah , let &apos;s go talk to him .
also , uh , could you call the hospital , please ,
and see if margery cannon was in dr. morgan &apos;s drug trials ?
yeah .
thanks .
ms. najafi is unavailable , but she left this for you .
margery &apos;s application to dr. morgan &apos;s program was denied .
her form of cancer couldn &apos;t be treated with his drugs .
so james miller came to work every day
and watched people in the program being cured
while his stepmom died .
so his revenge wasn &apos;t just against the hospital ,
but also dr. morgan .
and jennie tate was just collateral damage .
um , could we see james miller &apos;s personnel file , please ?
i &apos;m sorry , detective ,
but ms. najafi is the only person
who has access to those files . she &apos;s out .
out where ?
the construction foreman called ,
said there was some kind of problem .
there &apos;s nobody on the site at this hour .
thank you .
stop ! aah !
no , please !
no , please .
james , no ! don &apos;t !
don &apos;t do it .
please help me .
stay back .
it is not her fault that your stepmom is dead .
yes , it is .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s not anybody &apos;s fault .
they turned her away . they could &apos;ve helped her .
it &apos;s all their fault .
the treatment wouldn &apos;t help her cancer .
you don &apos;t know that .
james , listen to me .
margery would not have wanted this .
she helped people . she took care of people .
she would not want somebody else to die .
no ! no ! aah !
i got her ! i got her ! go !
she all right ?
she &apos;s responding to the antitoxin .
miller never had a chance to give her the whole syringe .
it &apos;s not a ghost .
thanks .
don &apos;t think about it .
yeah .
let &apos;s go .
maura ?
hello .
i &apos;m so glad you still came to the conference .
what i did was ... unforgivable .
well , i &apos;m not going to lie .
for a person of your ability to do such a thing ,
it was surprising and disappointing .
the blank page can make you a little crazy sometimes .
but i should not have violated your trust ,
and for that , i am deeply ashamed .
will you allow me to make it up to you ?
may i introduce you to some people ?
that &apos;s not necessary .
no , no . i @-@ i want to .
i meant what i said . you &apos;re a wonderful writer .
and these people might be able to help you .
please ?
okay .
where &apos;s detective rizzoli ?
i thought she was coming here with you tonight .
yeah , she &apos;s just running a few minutes late .
she had to shoot someone .
i only shoot people in the line of duty .
mostly .
um , we &apos;re fine .
samantha , in fact , has kindly offered to introduce us
to some of the wonderful writers here .
wow . how kind .
jane .

point taken .
tess ! tess . come and meet my friends .
this is tess .
hi . jane rizzoli .
ah . she &apos;s a detective with the boston police department .
oh . and is that dress official police issue ?
uh , yes .
actually , you should see when my brother wears it .
it &apos;s even more fabulous .
and this is dr. maura isles .
she &apos;s the chief medical examiner .
it is a pleasure to meet you .
oh , you two are gonna be the most popular people
in the room tonight .
you know , no one loves hearing about murder and mayhem
more than mystery writers .
absolutely . shall we ?
yes ?
yes .
such a pleasure to meet you .
well , i wanna ...
find me every seven minutes .
ooh . this looks promising .
it &apos;s a one @-@ week writer &apos;s retreat in the adirondacks .
and all vegan , no tv , no internet .
no , thank you .
we should both do it .
do you really hate me that much ?
you should write a book , too .
maura , that might be the worst idea you &apos;ve ever had .
why ? you have so many great stories .
great .
then you tell them , and i &apos;ll wait for the books on tape .
well , thanks for coming , anyway .
yes , the refreshments were refreshing .
frankie told me to meet him here after the concert .
