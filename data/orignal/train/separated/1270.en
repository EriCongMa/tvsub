Leroy?
Leroy, that's you?
It's okay.
It's me -- Daniel.
You okay?
You need help?
Jane! I'm double-parked -- come on.
Just give me a sec.
You know, I've given you 1,200 secs.
I've been sitting outside waiting for you.
Just chill out.
My -- in a bad mood.
Maybe the flat tire was an omen
and you should just stay home today.
Have you even showered?
No!
This is what you look like when there's no running water.
Again?
Yes, again.
I did tell you not to buy it.
When it was an apartment, it was perfect,
and then it found out it was becoming a condo,
and then everything started falling apart.
You can have it for a cup of coffee.
All right, come on. We'll stop on the way.
That better be the building manager.
Uh, hey, Jane.
I thought you would be gone by now.
Why, because I've been waiting for you
since yesterday, Gilbert?
Gil. Man.
Impatient, right?
She hasn't showered.
Or had a cup of coffee.
Please, tell me.
When did Boston join the third world?
I have seven renters to keep happy.
Condo owners are last priority.
You can always sell.
You know what?
Don't start again with that, okay?
Just get me some water -- please.
I'll see what I can do.
Is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
Was he just staring at my boobs?
47% of men look at a woman's breasts during a conversation.
Every time?
It's unclear.
If you were payin' by the pound, I'd be a rich man.
Why would you bring the poop inside?
Hey, Maura.
Hello, Tommy.
Let's go.
Just make sure that Gilbert skeevy
doesn't go through my underwear.
Clean ones or dirty?
Oh, my god, Tommy.
Could you -- don't! Throw that away.
Outside.
Non-fat, no-foam latte for Maura.
Thank you.
Triple latte for Claire.
Thank you. Have a lovely day.
Excuse me. I ordered before her.
Double-frap, no whip for Bill.
Thank you.
And I ordered before him.
Be patient.
She says, as she drinks her latte.
I'm gonna go get some stevia.
I'm gonna watch people who ordered after me
get their coffee before me.
Oh, I love your outfit.
It's so cute.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Have you seen the stevia?
Yeah. Right here.
Oh, love this stuff.
Double-shot espresso for Reggie.
Hey, thanks.
You're welcome.
Hey, we got a call.
How long -- did you go to costa rica to get the coffee beans?
How long does it take to make a latte?
Some people are so grumpy.
Jane.
Thank you.
Half-caf non-fat latte for Jeff.
First I'm freezing, and then I'm sweating.
It's like, global warming is so upsetting.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I-I didn't hear you. You don't have to be rude.
Just trying to get to work.
Well, someone's in a bad mood.
It'd be better if you would just share the milk and sugar.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, god.
What happened?
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my god, what -- Jane, what happened?
Oh, your friend threw her coffee at me.
No. No, no, no. I-I didn't.
It was an accident. I'm so sorry.
It was on purpose.
No, no. You bumped into me. I'm s--
I bumped into you? You burned me.
I mean, I wasn't moving fast enough for you.
I'm really, really sorry. Are you okay?
Are you burned?
Don't touch me. Don't -- don't touch me again.
I didn't touch you at all. - Don't --
I'm a doctor. Can I -- can I help you?
Just -- everyone just get away from me, okay?
It was an accident.
Okay, Jane. Let's just go.
What a bitch.
Okay.
Let's just get out of here.
I didn't mean to.
Of course you didn't.
And I didn't get any coffee.
Here, take mine.
What about you?
It's okay. Let's go.
It's a fluid situation
in this usually quiet Boston neighborhood.
What we know so far -- an elderly man holed up inside...
That's right, Denise.
We've just arrived at the scene
of a tense standoff between an elderly man and Boston police.
Wow. Homicide's running the scene?
Only till SWAT gets here.
We think the guy in the standoff killed somebody inside.
Sir, please, step back.
Dude... Who's that?
Damn.
She must be from the new crop of rookies.
Does she know how hot she is?
Why don't you go over there and tell her?
Detective.
Stop checking out the pretty cop
and make yourselves useful.
I need eyes around the back.
Hey, e-excuse me.
Any idea how long my street's gonna be blocked?
Might be a few hours.
Do you know the guy in the house?
Leroy? Uh, he's crazy.
What do you mean by crazy?
You know, nut-ball conspiracy theorist.
He's always going off
about, uh, U.F.O.s and government spies and...
Well, I guess I better call my office, huh?
Officer Hansen? Let me introduce you.
Detectives, this is officer Charlotte Hansen.
Oh, Charlie. Nice to meet you.
We need eyes in the back.
Take Charlie, show her the ropes.
I'll be out front.
Yeah. Right here.
Okay.
Oh. You look like you've already had a bad morning.
Me? Oh, no.
I haven't showered,
I had a skeevy building manager check out my boobs,
I spilled 16 ounces of hot coffee on some perfect stranger.
Yeah, no, I'm great.
Operations said there was a body inside?
Well, all we know for sure
is what the gunman told the 911 operator.
911. What is your emergency?
They're watching me, stealing from me!
Sir, please stay calm.
I need your address.
Oh, no, no. Daniel's dead.
It's possible he's suffering from persecutory delusions.
Who's Daniel?
We think it's a sanitation worker -- Daniel Raine.
We found his truck at the end of the block.
What do we know about the gunman?
Leroy Grovner.
72-year-old retired engineer, lives alone, no relatives.
Do we know if he's on any medications?
Oh, he doesn't trust doctors.
Last time he saw one was in the E.R. Six months ago.
Psychotic break?
Broken hip.
First responders said they tried to talk to him
but he says if he talks, it will only be to a lady cop.
Stay away from my house!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire! You see what I see?
Yeah. Smoke. He's shooting blanks.
All right. Everybody just stand down.
Hey, stand down. He's shooting blanks.
Maura, come on.
It's all right -- easy.
Mr. Grovner. It's okay.
What do you want?!
It's all right, okay?
We...We just want to -- we want to help Daniel.
Okay? Can we do that, please?
I'm a doctor.
If you let me see him, maybe I can help him.
Oh, all -- all right.
But it -- b-but I-it's a -- it's a mess down -- down there.
Can I hold that for you?
It's all right.
All right. Thank you.
Stand down!
All right. It's all right. You know what?
Why -- why don't we go sit down in one of the cars, okay?
Why don't you take this? Go check on Daniel.
All right.
Let's -- let's just go right over here. Okay? - Okay.
Maura?
Yeah, I'm here.
He's been dead for a few hours.
When's the power coming back on?
We get lost down here, they're never gonna find us.
Public works doesn't know why it went off,
so they're having a hard time restoring it.
Yeah. It's a garbage man, all right.
Daniel Raine.
Works for the sanitation department.
What's he doing down here?
Overtime?
You have enough light?
Enough to see a penetrating wound
resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
What's unusual is the wound pattern.
Somebody hit him hard. That's a lot of blood.
What did they hit him with? A lawn mower?
Sewing machine? Crock-pot?
I think we can rule out the crock-pot.
Whatever it was, it had a very sharp, jagged edge.
We talked to the neighbors.
They said Leroy started screaming
about space ships and little green men.
Yeah, right after the lights went out.
Then he started shooting.
Okay, so the aliens landed, and he lost his marbles.
Well, maybe they're down here.
Seems like everything else is.
Except the murder weapon.
All right, let's, uh, let's start a search.
Hey. An 8-track player.
And a flowbee.
I always wanted one of these.
Next birthday. On me.
Hey, Korsak, let's you and I
go back and interrogate Leroy.
Frost, Frankie, you guys do the search, okay?
Okay.
Why me?
Well, it's either hoarder duty or liquor licenses for me.
I'm gonna have to get this body back to the morgue.
Well, leave Frankie,
then I can start the background investigation.
All right.
Detectives.
Need anything else?
Uh, yeah. Detective Frost was just...
...leaving.
Well, I-I could use your help.
Okay.
You know what, Detective Frost? Why don't you stay?
Yeah.
Yeah, uh, there's a lot of work to do here.
Yes, there's a lot of work to do here.
Crazy, right?
Almost 49,000 hits already.
It's going totally viral.
Okay, how do you get it off of this thing?
I don't want people to see this.
It's funny, ma.
Isn't that nice?
Enjoying a video of your sweet daughter.
You saw it?
Several times, along with everyone at headquarters.
Let's see it again.
Oh. It really gives me a chuckle.
Someone's in a bad mood.
You trying -- you trying -- you trying --
I didn't touch you at all. I didn't touch you at all.
Oh, you must be very proud.
It's awesome.
Get away.
She's gonna be famous, mom.
I'm gonna send her the link.
Don't you do that.
You catch the garbage man stealing your stuff,
you whack him over the head.
Maybe you didn't mean to hit him so hard.
I don't like it in here.
I'm only talking to the nice lady.
I got this.
It's okay, Leroy. I'm here.
Why don't you just tell me what happened?
Not you. You took my gun.
The nice doctor lady.
I'm Dr. Maura Isles.
Can you tell me your name?
Leroy. Leroy Grovner.
Hello, Mr. Grovner.
Let's start with,
"No one likes it when someone steals your stuff."
I don't see the value in stating the obvious.
But -- but it's -- it's my name, and you asked.
Just say it.
I'm sure you felt frustrated when your belongings were taken.
I thought I was going crazy at first.
And I'm not crazy, you know.
My things, they were disappearing into thin air.
But then I realized who it was -- them.
"Them"?
They've been sniffing around, spying on me.
Ask him who.
Who's been spying?
Them -- stealing and spying.
Who's "them"?
I-I had to put a stop...
Poor old guy, I wonder if he even knows.
So, the next time I heard them over me,
I used the bug zapper.
Got them good.
Okay, ask him what he means by "got them."
How did you get them?
Took them down.
They were mad.
They came looking for me because I had it.
You had what?
They got -- they got daniel instead.
Okay. Ask him about the bug zapper.
Is that the murder weapon?
Leroy, is that how daniel died?
You zapped him?
No, I -- I didn't kill him. He was my friend.
He gave me good stuff from his -- from his garbage route.
He even gave me a tx-78 sump pump.
You think Daniel was bringing stuff for the basement,
and then Leroy got confused and killed him?
Yeah, maybe.
I hate to speculate. We don't know what Daniel was doing there.
Hey, who are you talking to?
Are they here?
They're here. No, Leroy. Nobody is here.
It's not gonna work. You can't have my things!
How does a frail 79-year-old with a hip fracture
take out a guy Daniel's size?
Adrenaline? Fear?
No one's here but me.
That may be a killer ass, but it's not the murder weapon.
Glad the power's back on.
She's not your type.
Oh, oh, that's my type.
In your dreams.
Well, so she's your type?
She's exactly my type.
I mean, do you guys know what the murder weapon looks like?
I'll have more information
once I hear back from the medical examiner,
but look for anything that could be used as a club.
Okay, yeah.
I'm getting a lot of electric blankets and blenders.
Me, too. I mean, I-I got a pogo stick, a dentist drill.
And...What the hell is this?
Oh, my gosh. That's an aebleskiver pan.
My grandma, she's Norwegian.
Uh, she makes them all the time.
They're, like, these cute little pancake balls.
Yum. Introduce me to your grandmother.
Okay.
Uh, so, do we just bag it all, or...
Um, well, uh...
He's pretty junior.
I'm in homicide,
So, let's bag everything near where the body was.
Got it.
Whoa, sir. This is a crime scene.
Oh, no, it's okay. I live next door.
No, it isn't okay. I need to ask you to leave now.
I, uh, brought you some lemonade.
I thought you guys might be thirsty.
No. We're not thirsty. Come on. Let's go.
Yeah, well, why don't I -- I'll just leave it here?
You can bring the pitcher back later.
The yellow house with the white picket fence.
No, you can't leave that here. Come on.
Oh. Let's go.
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.
Oh, listen, uh, Leroy, uh, borrowed a bunch of stuff
over the years and never returned it,
So if you happen to come across a metric wrench set
or, uh, a pair of old hockey skates,
uh, I'd really like to get them back.
We'll keep an eye out. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He was struck at least twice,
and whatever instrument was used
left an odd pattern in the wound.
Leroy had enough odd crap in his house
to keep craigslist in business for the next 2,000 years.
Can you narrow it down?
It's interesting.
Symmetrical linked hexagons, like a honeycomb.
Would be the first time anybody died
from being bashed in the head with a beehive.
It's not a beehive.
I'm putting my money on an electric toothbrush.
Or maybe the knitting machine.
You know, I've never seen anything like it.
Gonna have Susie take a look and see what she can find
in the tool-mark identification database.
There's particulate in the wound.
I'll run it through GCMS.
Okay.
Oh. That's Frost and Frankie.
Want to tell them what to look for.
Hey, Dr. Isles.
We're still sorting through junk.
Nothing promising so far.
Well, the murder weapon
is approximately the size of a baseball bat.
Yeah, and it has a beehive attached to it.
A who?
It has an edge that will look like a honeycomb.
So...It's not robotman?
You know what, Frankie?
Why don't you try acting like a real detective?
Oh, you mean like this?
Out of my way,
Or I'm gonna throw my extra-hot triple latte on you!
Oh, no! Please don't, officer!
Wait a minute. How do you know about that?
You haven't seen it?
Seen what?
Go on youtube.
Okay.
Okay, now type in
"Mean detective Jane."
I didn't touch you at all.
It was on purpose.
You know what? Don't -- don't touch me again.
I didn't touch you at all.
What a bitch.
Here, take mine.
Wait. No. I didn't say that.
They must have lip-dubbed you.
That is expert editing.
Okay, wait, now you're an expert on viral videos, too?
Come on, it's funny.
It was on purpose.
You know what? Don't -- don't touch me again.
Et tu, Brute?
Well, it is kind of funny.
Not if you're me.
Hi, honey.
Oh, yay. I'm pregnant.
Don't I have to have sex to be pregnant?
Okay, for heaven's sake,
we had a party for Darlene in accounting.
I thought you could use some cheering up.
Why would I need cheering up?
Just because my video is more popular
than that monkey flinging his poop?
So, you spilled a little coffee.
Or threw it.
I did not throw it.
Mm, in slo-mo, it kind of looks like you might've.
Okay. I'm going to leave this in case you want any later.
None for you.
Thanks, ma.
Okay, turn that off or I will throw Darlene's cake at you.
What do we know about Leroy?
Well...
Leroy was telling the truth.
He and Daniel were friends.
Leroy seems harmless. My gut says he's no killer.
Yeah, me too.
But we're putting him in lockup with a bunch of creeps.
All right, so let's get him a psych eval,
buy him some time in the hospital.
At least he'll stay alive.
Good idea.
What about Frost and Frankie?
They come up with the murder weapon yet?
Not yet.
Stuff's coming into the crime lab for processing, though.
Why don't we remove the pretty rookie
and they can get focused?
Another good idea.
I'll call it in.
Echo 4-0-2. I'm off on an L-20 here.
Frankie!
Yeah.
Frankie, look at this.
What is it?
I think Leroy made an E.M.P. gun.
An electromagnetic pulse gun?
Yeah, with an old-school approach.
Does it work?
I don't know.
Maybe we should find out.
Echo 4-0-2. I'm off on an L-20 here.
Where you gonna aim it?
Uh, definitely not at the houses.
Uh, maybe there?
Echo 4-0-2. They want you back...
Go for it.
10-4. On my way.
Hello?
Ah, I think we just took out
the electrical systems in the cruisers.
Uh, that could be expensive.
Let's get back in the basement.
Oh, hey, you guys?
Uh, something just happened to the radio in my car.
Weird.
Oh, that happens all the time.
Thought I did something.
Just call the guys in the shop.
They'll take care of it.
Okay. Thanks.
Why don't you talk to him, nice lady?
Hello, Leroy.
Is that my stuff?
Yes.
Better all be there.
It was all inventoried,
but why don't you check through it to make sure?
I want to go home.
They're probably in there right now, taking my things.
Mr. Grovner, you understand you're not being released?
The judge has ordered
that you have an evaluation at a hospital.
Yeah, 'cause they all think I'm -- I'm crazy.
Everyone thinks I'm crazy. I'm not crazy.
I believe you.
I'll do anything to prove I didn't kill Daniel.
He wasn't stealing from me. It was someone else.
Uh, can I borrow your notepad?
Thanks.
Mr. Grovner,
why don't you describe to me the items that you're missing?
Um, my, uh, my circuit boards,
a-a-and an antique bird cage, and hockey stuff.
Circuit boards, antique?
Yeah.
Bird cage.
Hockey equipment.
My dad was an equipment manager for a hockey team.
Saved all of it and gave it to me before he died.
Yeah?
Okay.
I'll file an incident report
and see if I can get you your things back.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
Why do you say that?
I thought that you weren't a nice lady, but -- but you are.
Thank you.
Okay. Come on, Leroy.
You're gonna be just fine.
Rizzoli.
Yes, sir.
In my office -- now.
Is it too late to call in sick?
You want a union rep?
Why, do I need one?
Well...you might.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Someone's in a bad mood.
Just trying to get to work.
Get away -- get away -- get away from me.
Don't t-t-touch me.
B-b-b-b-bitch.
It was an accident.
Yeah, we all know that,
but that woman says you gave her second-degree burns.
Oh, my god.
We have to investigate you.
What? Why?
Because she's filed a police-brutality complaint against you.
It's not the end of the world.
Yeah, I know.
I'd be amazed if anybody outside BPD even saw it.
It has 79,000 hits, Maura.
Well, I'll bet you they're mostly Europeans.
Europeans?
Hey, Coop.
Hey, Cooper.
Hey -- Coop, it's me. What?
Cooper.
He must be picking up on your anxiety.
My anxiety?
Yeah, we're late for mah-jongg.
Wait, what -- what anxiety? - Uh, come on, Cooper.
I'm not gonna let her spill anything on you, I promise.
So, Ms. Billings is European?
Oh, hey, look.
It's that cop that throws coffee at people.
Hey, all right, move along.
Oh, yeah.
Do you throw doughnuts at little kids on school buses, too?
Okay, that's harassment.
Oh, yeah? Why don't you come arrest me?
No, ignore him. Come on.
I just want to take a shower.
Just want to take a shower. That's it.
Yo, sista.
Did Gilbert fix my water?
Gil is cool.
Tommy, did he fix my water?
I don't think so.
He had to take another call, but he did do that.
Tommy! How could you let him do that?
There's a leak in the building, Jane.
It might even be black mold.
Think we'll have to wear those mask thingies?
I don't see any signs of mold.
How am I supposed to take a shower?
Jane, come on. You can stay at my place.
Gil was asking about you. I think he likes you.
Swell.
Oh, oh, here it is. Here it is.
And if you think you've had a bad day,
Be glad you're not boston detective Jane Rizzoli,
who finds herself in hot water
after spilling scalding coffee on a stranger.
Is he? Is that?
We talked to her brother
to find out if there is more to this story.
Oh, Jane has a temper, all right.
Oh, yeah. When we were growing up,
nobody messed with us,
'cause if they did, Jane would kick the crap out of them.
You did an interview in my apartment?
Thought this was a condo.
In my apartment?!
I-I mean, I said a lot of nice things about you.
Tommy!
They must've cut them out.
Why would you -- get out.
Get out now! Get out now.
Jane Rizzoli?
Yes.
You've been served.
I can't -- I...
She sued me.
Goodbye.
Vince... Thanks for coming.
Sure. Is she here?
Yep.
Upstairs taking a shower.
This lawsuit looks like a boiler plate.
Thought they filed it fast.
Boiler plate? So, it's bullshit?
Sorry, I'm -- I'm upset.
You're right.
You never know what a jury will do.
Poor jane.
You know, I liked it better
before the computer media cloud stuff.
Me, too. You could have a conversation.
You want some coffee?
Love some.
You want a little Irish Whiskey in it?
Sure, but skip the coffee.
Half a million bucks? That's what she wants?
Can you believe it?
Vince, Jane doesn't have that kind of money
Unless she sells her condo.
It won't come to that.
She was on the job.
The city has to cover legal costs.
Well, I'm still gonna help her.
You're a good mom.
Oh, I didn't know you were in here.
My back hurts.
High cortisol levels from stress.
Why would I be stressed?
Just a coffee-throwing b-b-b-b-b-bitch.
Stop. It was one moment in a life.
One moment caught on tape.
Well, let it go. Ujjayi breath.
"Ooh-jie" Who?
It's a deep, cleansing breath.
Just focus on the present.
I'm trying, but you're vibrating.
It's Susie.
The particulate found in the victim's head wound
was fiber-reinforced polymer.
Is that animal, vegetable, or mineral?
Mineral.
It's a fine mixture of glass, carbon, and basalt.
And what's that used for?
High-tech applications.
It's used as a structural component
in everything from skyscrapers to aircraft.
High-tech murder weapon.
Wonder if Leroy found something and drug it into his basement.
You're a very good detective.
And a very good person...
Once you've had your coffee.
Yeah, I let the little things get to me today.
We all do, Jane.
Just take a deep breath and stay in the present.
Why does work always know
when I'm trying to stay in the present?
Rizzoli.
What? When?
All right, get two more uniforms over there.
Thanks.
What is it?
Somebody tried to break into Leroy's basement.
All right, thank you.
Morning.
That was the sergeant at the crime scene.
They kept the flood lights on all night.
So far, so good.
That's got to be our killer, don't you think?
And what is so valuable in there
that you would risk getting caught?
Good thing the guys on watch were paying attention.
Maybe Daniel was down there looking for the same thing,
and that's why he's dead.
Who left these here?
I don't know, but they'll get sick of teasing you pretty soon.
Ooh, it's still hot.
Thank you.
It's very thoughtful.
Did, uh, Frost and Frankie find anything
that could be the murder weapon?
Maybe. You said high-tech?
They found something.
CSRU is bringing it in for Maura to have a look at.
All right, this is Maura.
She's confirmed it's made of fiber-reinforced polymer --
the same stuff she found in the victim's head wound.
Sounds like our murder weapon.
Yeah.
You want to be Claire or Maura?
Doesn't matter, as long as you don't throw the other one at me.
Good one.
Thank you.
Any idea what it is?
I'm not sure.
It looks pretty small to be the murder weapon.
It's not the murder weapon,
But it might be made of the same materials.
Yeah. It's really light.
Stiffness and strength at a very low weight.
It's because of this.
You see the honeycomb-like structure?
Yeah, it looks like the marks
that were pounded into Daniel's head.
Now, what the hell is it?
You know, whatever it is, it's made of highly complex
and a unique combination of materials.
You said high-tech applications?
Mm-hmm. I mean, it's a long shot,
But what if we did a patent search,
find out what we're looking for?
Two days in a hoarder's basement.
I'm officially claustrophobic.
Ah, we're almost done.
I don't believe this.
B.O., number 4?
Do you know whose skate this is?
Can't be.
No.
It's the right size.
Did we just find Bobby Orr's skate?
I think we did.
Hey, wait.
You remember that neighbor guy who tried to bring us lemonade?
Yeah. Yeah, and he had that story
about lending Leroy his hockey skates.
What guy brings lemonade?
You're right.
And if this really is Bobby Orr's skate,
it's crazy valuable.
What if Leroy's neighbor was stealing something
from the basement when the garbage man surprised him?
Maybe friendly neighbor
is really friendly neighborhood murderer.
Which means we're looking for the murder weapon
in the wrong house.
That's him -- Mac Hazlet.
He's quite the successful ebay entrepreneur.
Antiques, collectibles, hockey memorabilia.
Started raking it in about six months ago.
Leroy broke his hip six months ago.
Frost, see if you can find the E.R. Admissions report.
You thinking Mac discovered
Leroy's antiques road show in his basement
and started stealing his stuff?
Yep.
Wow. Was Mac.
He's listed on the report.
Says he heard Leroy's cries for help and called 911.
You know something?
Mac needs to pick on someone his own age.
You sold Terry o'Reilly's hockey glove,
Phil Esposito's stick.
You just listed one of Bobby Orr's skates.
The left one.
I wonder where the right one is.
Be a lot more valuable as a pair.
I'm a big Bruins fan.
Where do you find this great stuff?
Um, uh, here and there.
Uh, flea markets, private collectors.
So, not next door in Leroy's basement?
I took a few things.
I mean, you know, it was just sitting there collecting dust.
I-I wanted to put it
in the hands of guys like you who really appreciate it.
Oh, that was really nice of him, wasn't it, sergeant?
It sure was.
What do you think that murder weapon you have would be worth
to somebody that collects that kind of stuff?
What murder weapon?
The metal club you used to kill the garbage man.
I didn't kill anybody.
Our colleagues are tearing apart your house as we speak.
You can't do that.
A judge said we can.
You could make it easy on everyone.
Just tell us where the murder weapon is.
I-I'm not telling you crap.
You're under arrest for larceny.
7:59 a.m.
Do you know what that means?
It was one minute before 8:00?
And what time do you go on duty?
8:00.
The good news is, this is no longer a police-brutality case.
Oh, that is good news.
What's the bad news?
It's a civil matter.
And because you weren't on the clock,
the city's refusing to indemnify you.
You can't be serious.
So I'm on my own?
Look at that -- another 17 cents.
I wonder if F. Lee Bailey will take your case now.
If I tell him to shut up,
do you think he'll put it on youtube?
I wouldn't put it past him.
Okay, where's Maura?
I want to know what that lawyer said.
Well?
I brought matcha tea.
It's from utashinai. You want to try some?
Maura, what did he say?
Oh, look, another 50 cents.
Rizzoli, get over here and help your customers.
Yes, Mr. Stanley.
Okay, just tell me what he said.
He said it would be expensive to defend.
I just spilled coffee.
I know.
It's a frivolous lawsuit, but he looked at the video,
and if she has medical expenses or compensatory damages --
For crying out loud.
Just -- how much is it to hire him?
He wants a $25,000 retainer.
Oh, my god.
Maura, every cent I have is in my condo.
I know.
I could live in Leroy's basement.
Oh, come on. Let me help you.
You know, I'll just cash out some mutual funds.
No. I can't take your money.
Don't look at that.
I can't believe I'm gonna lose my home over this.
Maura, look at her blouse.
They can manufacture an artificial heart,
but they can't get a polyester blend to drape properly.
No.
That.
You see it now?
Her blouse is repelling the droplets of coffee.
Wait, that could be made of a scald-proof nanofabric.
Help for the fashion-challenged.
Teflon-nanotube coating is used on some textiles
to produce scald-proof fabrics.
So, she set it up.
She even had somebody there to tape it.
You think she wanted you to spill your coffee
so she could sue?
But how'd she know you were a cop?
I'll be damned.
What? What do you see?
Whirls and ridges.
Whoever videotaped it left a fingerprint on the camera lens.
We should run that.
Yes!
Yes!
Oh, yes!
I found the patent.
I know what this is.
It's a piece of a new type of rotor blade from a drone.
From a drone?
Yeah. Manufactured by JFP.
Jarvis flight project.
That would explain the honeycomb interior.
And the edge of the rotor blade
is consistent with the wound pattern.
How does a piece of a drone end up in Leroy's basement?
Maybe he dragged it inside
after he shot it down with the bug zapper.
E.M.P. would destroy the drone's electronic system --
Probably cause a power outage, too.
Yeah, but do we know if that even works?
Oh, yeah. It works.
Really?
How do you know that?
Well --
Have anything to do with the two cruisers
who got their brains fried at the crime scene?
I think I'll take the fifth.
Drones can be used for corporate espionage.
And Leroy was convinced that he was being watched, spied on.
Spy on an old man's house with a million-dollar drone?
Maybe they were spying on the neighborhood.
Frontload tech just moved its R&D offices right nearby.
Yeah, but there would be a ton of firewalls
to protect proprietary information.
Yeah, but look at all these houses sold.
Frost, who lives around Leroy?
Frontload tech engineers.
A lot of them.
That's it.
You take your phone and your computer home.
If I wanted to steal,
I would send a drone, fly it over your home.
It was doing a War-Drive --
Piggybacking on Wi-Fi networks and downloading everything.
Frost, look up JFP's website.
Got it right here.
What else does JFP do?
They offer intelligence-gathering services.
Look who's head of the division.
We saw him outside Leroy's house at the standoff.
Jim Blackman -- former navy seal,
specializes in military-intelligence gathering.
Said he was a neighbor.
Yeah, except he lives 20 miles away.
Could you track the drone sent out back to Leroy's basement?
Yes. It had a GPS locator.
This is a picture of Jim at the crime scene.
He told me he had to get to the office,
but he looks a hell of a lot more interested
about what's going on inside Leroy's house
than he does in getting to work.
The break-in last night.
It was a huge risk, but there must be something inside that house
that ties him to the murder.
But what?
I mean, we went through everything.
What did Leroy have in his pockets when we brought him in?
69 cents, package of tums, a rabbit's foot.
And a miniature hard drive.
Can you punch in on that?
It's -- it's hard to see,
but I'm pretty sure it's stamped "JFP."
JFP -- Jim blackman's drone-manufacturing company.
We need to find Jim.
I'm gonna make sure Leroy's safe first.
Hey, this is Detective Rizzoli.
I need a status report on Leroy Grovner.
He's been released.
Clear.
Put it down -- please!
I don't know what you want.
Where's the hard drive you stole?
Stop it.
Tell me where it is!
Leave me alone!
You're the reason your friend is dead.
You shouldn't have killed Daniel.
And you shouldn't have shot down my drone and taken it apart.
Now, where is it?
Where's the hard drive you stole?
Police have it.
You're a liar!
You tell me where it is or you're a dead man.
Jim, it's over. Put the gun down.
No. Don't move or I'll blow the old man's head off.
Let's all just calm down.
Like I said, Jim, it's over.
I'm not going down. I'm gonna take you with me.
What? With Leroy's shotgun?
Damn straight.
Leroy, you load that like you did before?
Sure did.
You're a military man, Jim.
You ought to recognize the difference
between live ammo and blanks.
That's for Daniel, you miserable yo-yo.
Come on, Jim.
Quit your whining.
Leroy, you okay?
All my stuff.
My whole -- my whole life.
It's all -- it's all gone.
I-it's not gone, Leroy.
We'll get your stuff back.
Yeah.
We got a hit on that fingerprint.
You recognize that name?
Yeah. I sure do.
I was thinking desert tones with a pop of cactus green.
What do you think?
I think you're a little too far east
for a southwest decor.
Especially in a historic building.
Jane, I-I can explain.
To a judge.
What? You did this for my condo?
That's crazy.
It's even crazier
to leave your fingerprints on the camera lens,
and that's all over Youtube, too.
It was, uh, Gil's idea.
I was happy living on the ground floor.
Oh, right.
"Baby, please, could we convert the third floor?
"It's the nicest spot in the building.
Please, please, please?"
I do not talk like that.
You see what I'm dealing with?
Okay. We'll get you separate cells.
You're under arrest for fraud.
I cannot believe I hooked up with you!
You hooked up with me. Right.
Hold on, I want to show you something.
Come here.
What?
If I'm in it, I don't want to see it.
I'm sorry.
Why do you say that?
I-I thought you weren't a-a nice lady, but -- but you are.
You know, we live in a dual-party consent state.
I could sue you for secretly taping me.
Go ahead and try. I have a good attorney.
It has 11 hits, Maura.
Give it some time.
What? For the "Europeans" to discover it?
Okay, maybe we need to spice it up, add a little music.
Yeah. We can dub in "B-b-b-b-bitch!"
That was good. I could rap for you.
That's -- that's spitting. That's -- that's not rapping.
That's what they do.
No. No.
Here. You're all right.
Got some-- -Do I have --
