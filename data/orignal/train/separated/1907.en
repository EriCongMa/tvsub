"Everybody's Crying Mercy"
There's this playground game that kids play.
I'll get him. You can't pick him up.
Yes, I can.
No, your incision needs to heal. I got him.
They lock hands, and on the count of 3...
They try to snap each other's fingers off.
Hurry up before he wakes up the...
Mommy?
Girls.
You hold out as long as you can...
or at least longer than the other guy.
The game doesn't end until someone says "stop."
Gives up... cries "mercy."
It isn't a fun game.
Move over.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I'm bored.
Really bored.
Nope.
Oh, don't kid yourself.
Call Hunt.
No.
Then try the internet like everybody else.
For porn?
For dating.
Find somebody else to get horny with.
I have a girlfriend.
Oh, she's passed out with her friends.
Again.
Did she ever sleep with you?
Did you guys have sex, and it was awful?
Was she awful?
No.
Were you awful,
and now you're so ashamed you can't even look at her?
No.
Ooh, was it weird?
Is she a man?
Ooh. Secret penis.
Shut up!
Well, why don't you guys ever sleep together?
We will!
Ohh.
You two haven't done it yet.
We do.
Oh, you do done it?
We have.
Oh--oh, you have? You do?
We--we--we--we do.
Okay. Oh--
we do!
Just get out!
Okay. Hmm. Okay. Just think about that.
'Cause it's been, like,
a week and you haven't closed the deal.
What have you done to evil spawn?
I was sleeping.
Oh! oh, god! I knew you'd cheer me up.
Mnh!
Would it kill her
to bring me more than one pair of Sofia's socks?
Frickin' thoughtless.
Where are Sofia and Zola?
Um, um, Derek's putting their shoes on.
Ah.
Are you sure you can handle both of them?
Yes.
They're the only people who don't piss me off right now.
I'll text you when they're both in day care. Hi!
Ah! you're a goddess.
And yet my w-I-f-e still sleeps around.
Okay, ladies!
Yes, here we go! here we go!
Here, take your duck. Take your duck.
We're going on a ferry ride.
Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day.
Oh. What arwe gonna do when she fixes her marriage and leaves us?
Oh, I think we're a ways off from that. Oh!
Hey, I'm back. You still there?
Hi. How's-- how's everything going?
It's... fine.
Uh, not the easiest patient, but I got his number.
Hey, is he still losing weight? His appetite's not great.
But that happens. You know that.
Right. And you're sure you don't need my help?
Absolutely not. Go snuggle your baby.
Okay.
Will you let me know if his albumin drops below 2.5?
I'm hanging up. Stop calling me.
Richard Webber.
Seven days status post ex lap with pancreatic debridement.
His daily weights are trending down.
Albumin's low at 2.
O.T. wants to do a swallow study.
In the meantime, I recommend starting N.G. tube feeds.
No.
No tube.
He doesn't seem to want a tube.
Respectfully, Dr. Bailey...
Make sure to replete his electrolytes,
and he'll start recovering.
We've already given him--
Give him more.
Where the hell is Shane? He was supposed to study with us.
Mm, more practice for us.
Jo, hit me.
Dude, pants!
Crap. Sorry. I'm stuck on a question.
What's with the underwear?
Totally not work-appropriate.
I'm waiting for Alex to make a move,
so I'm prepared all the time.
What about grooming?
All the time.
That's exhausting.
Why don't you just make the first move?
'cause I'm not the slut who just jumps into bed with someone
right after her friend died.
Really?
Well, I'm not gonna advertise it.
Trauma in the pit. Gotta go.
It's been a week, and he hasn't made a move. Is that weird?
Yeah.
Haircut.
Yes.
You can't just say "haircut."
You have to say "nice haircut."
Otherwise, I'll think that you think it's a bad haircut.
And I'm wearing a dress and I got a haircut
'cause I wanna look nice today. Do I look nice?
You look tense.
Say I look nice!
You look nice.
Was that so hard?
Mm.
Here we are.
Oh, my god.
Why are we here?
So you can see it for yourself
so this is not just a concept.
There is a hole in this hospital,
And it is leaking money.
But isn't that what insurance is for?
They are swamped with storm claims.
Now with this outpatient surgery wing gone,
all of those patients are now overloading our regular O.R.s.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Meet. Make a plan. Be the board.
We're all swamped.
And Meredith and Derek are on leave. Webber's down.
Yeah, and you and Torres can't be in the same room.
I have -- I have a patient.
You know, right now
this hospital needs doctors more than it needs board members.
What this hospital needs is both.
If you people can't be both, then we are in a lot of trouble.
I should go.
Why?
We can't be alone together.
We're just...talking about work.
Nurses' station. Can I help you?
You all right?
Yeah.
No. I -- no.
I haven't heard yet.
About my boards.
But don't freak out. You passed.
Well, if I didn't,
you'll know that the first time wasn't your fault.
It was all me.
Don't freak out.
Hey. You're riding with me today.
Yeah, about that -- - Come on, it's a good one.
Coming through!
Oh, what do we got?
Human pincushion.
Kathleen Kane, 38.
Woman versus shattered baseball bat.
Puncture wounds to the chest
and what looks like a distal radius fracture.
B.P. 85 palp, pressure 135.
The batter was jammed with a fastball,
and -- and the bat, it just exploded, you know?
My jersey's really messed up.
Don't worry about that, baby.
Okay, everybody. Ready? On my count.
One, two, three.
I'm here. I'm right here, okay?
Somebody paged me?
Possible colles' fracture.
Uh, sir, I need you to wait outside.
All right? Right now, she needs you to give us room to work.
We need another nurse in here!
You're gonna make sure she's all right, right? Kat?
All right, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna
show you where you can wait. Okay?
Decreased breath sounds on the right.
We need x-ray in here stat!
Right away.
I'm dizzy. It's dark.
Am I dying?
No, ma'am.
Her systolic's down to 78.
Tell Dante.
You have to tell Dante. Look at me.
If I die...
You're not dying.
You need to tell my husband. Promise me.
Uh, of course.
He needs to know.
And tell him...
I will. What is it?
I cheated on him with his brother.
What?!
What did she say?
Did you hear what she asked me?
People say crazy things when they're in shock.
C.T. ready for us?
Hey, Kepner, did you hear back yet, by the way?
No, not yet.
You think that's bad?
You think it's good?
So do I have to tell her husband?
Tell him what?
She grabbed me with her bloody claw
and said if she dies to tell him that she slept with his brother.
Bitch.
Why would she ask me to do that?
Maybe she wants a clear conscience.
Maybe he cheated first and trashed the marriage.
Maybe he's an inconsiderate cheating bastard,
and she wanted to get the last word.
So...I don't have to tell him, right?
How about you just don't let her die?
Okay, we can't wait for C.T. We gotta get her into the O.R.
We'll put the chest tube in there.
Uh, sorry.
Uh, just confirming I'll see you tonight at 7:00?
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
Callie, we agreed to couples therapy.
Yeah, we agreed to a lot of things. So...
Okay, well, I'll be there.
Murphy, make yourself useful and put a splint on that arm.
He needs an N.G. tube, Dr. Grey.
I was hoping you could call Dr Bailey and --
Dr. Bailey is gonna kill me if I call her again.
Richard is just being stubborn,
and Bailey doesn't want to call him out.
Order the N.G. tube,
And that way, at least it will be ready
by the time Bailey comes to her senses.
But I'm not sure that she -- - I have to go.
An hour and a half to go get milk?
I think, um...
I might've closed my eyes in the store parking lot.
I really should be studying.
Trust me. You are gonna want to be in on this.
This is the best part of the job.
Cara.
Carlos.
Guys, this is Dr. Edwards.
She'll be assisting today.
And I...have the simulation back.
Mm. Show me. Show me.
Okay, now first, we're gonna be removing the scars
using tissue harvested from your back and scalp.
And then I'm gonna hide our new scars
right here in the facial planes.
And it's gonna look a little something like this...
Oh, my god.
Really?
You can do that?
You can make me look like that?
Now it's a estimate, but it is very, very close.
And it's free?
'Cause our insurance maxed out about two surgeries ago.
We know. That's why this one's on us.
Hey, Cara.
I didn't think I was gonna get to go back to work.
She teaches kindergarten.
Yeah, she's afraid she's gonna scare the kids.
And she can't teach without feeling her best, right?
You guys!
Thank you... so much.
You still want to study?
She has lost a lot of blood, but she's stable for now.
We're gonna take her into surgery and remove the fragments.
Okay. Okay, thanks.
Marcus, she's-- she's going into surgery, man.
Is she gonna be all right?
No, it's okay. He's family. He's my brother.
She's...
I'm...
gonna...
see you after.
Thanks, man.
Uh, in the 17 years since your infant heart transplant,
your mitral valve has started to fail.
So replacing it would increase cardiac function.
And he won't need another transplant.
That is the hope.
I gotta ask you again.
Are you sure that you wanna do this?
There's a high risk of tearing a ventricle,
uh, bleeding, arrhythmias--
You're saying he'd need a transplant anyway.
I'm saying that he could die.
The safest bet is to put Michael on the list for a new heart.
No.
I understand the risks. We talked about it.
We almost lost him waiting for his last heart.
When it was clear he was dying,
I asked the nurse if I could hold him.
He was so tiny.
I spent a whole night
looking in his eyes, telling him I loved him,
accepting that I would never, ever hear his first word.
I held my baby while he died.
And then the phone rang.
But I almost lost him.
And I cannot go through that again.
The chance that there will be another donor that matches me,
that I'll live long enough for us to find that person,
that I'll even get to the top of the list...
We like these odds better.
Okay.
Well, if your MRI is good,
we'll get started today.
That kid should be on the U.N.O.S. list.
Well, you heard them, Alex.
They wanna take a shot.
And who are you to say no to a high-risk surgery?
Let's just see what his MRI says.
Funny thing.
I didn't order an N.G.tube.
Did you hear me order an N.G. tube, Dr. Webber?
No.
I--
So you can imagine our surprise
when a nurse brought one in,
along with a feeding pump.
Dr. Webber worried that I had changed his course of treatment
without consulting him.
Dr. Bailey--
I told him I did not.
So then we got to thinking about who, perhaps,
could have ordered these things,
and your name came up.
I was trying to be proactive.
In case repleting his electrolytes doesn't work--
You wanna be proactive?
Get me some soup.
You heard the man.
Hey, what do you mean "no pro bono surgeries"?
All--all funds are being reallocated to storm repair
until further notice.
What? Who said that?
The board did, so... you.
All right, well, my lady's facial reconstruction surgery
was booked way before the storm.
She teaches kindergarten.
Avery, I don't make the rules.
I just get to be the bad cop here.
So then I'll just have the board meet,
and they're gonna approve it.
Well, that's gonna be tricky since everyone on the board
has their own pro bonos that they wanna do.
So when you all get together, maybe come find me
and tell me how you plan to fund repairing the outpatient O.R.
so we're not drowning in patients.
Come on. We're gonna get to that when things slow down.
Things won't slow down until we get to it.
Well, if you'd let me finish my reconstruction surgery--
Avery, we do not have the money for this surgery.
Listen to me. All due respect, you said it yourself--
You don't make the rules. I do.
Now Cara Mcadams--that pro bono is not gonna be canceled.
I need you to be a good cop, a traffic cop.
Uh, I'm sorry?
Move some patients around.
If we're overloaded,
then transfer them to Seattle Pres.
I don't care. But make some room.
Yes, sir.
So I'm waiting on the kid's MRI,
and if it's too crappy,
I have to put him on the transplant list
and no surgery. So what do you think?
I think he went to the store
and took a nap in the parking lot.
Where's my nap, Cristina?
I don'know. I didn't steal your nap.
I'm sorry.
It's just my boobs hurt and they're covered in lanolin
and I smell like an old couch.
Okay. Got eyes on Webber.
No N.G. Tube.
Damn it, Shane.
I almost touched his arm today.
Webber's?
No. Owen's.
He's so stressed out about the hospital,
and I thought, you know,
I'd offer some support and touch his arm.
But... you know, you touch his arm
and then you're in bed,
and then...
nothing's changed.
Oh, crap. Hold on.
I got my valve kid's MRI.
Mer?
Mer?
Oh, big help.
The shower works better when you're in it.
He's hungry, and my nipples are no use to him.
I know.
Did you see the look on her face
when you showed her that picture?
I just--I wanna see that look on her new face.
I'm glad chief Hunt came around.
I made sure he got the message that I am doing the surgery
whether he likes it or not.
Where is Mrs. Mcadams?
She was moved out by chief Hunt.
I don't think he got the message.
Owen?
Why do you keep rescheduling my surgeries?
Well, let's have a board meeting, and I'll tell you.
Why can't you tell me right now?
Because I'm busy rescheduling surgeries.
Why?!
Owen?
What's this about a purchasing freeze on the NICU budget?
Good. I have two of you here. At least maybe we could...
Oh. Okay.
We're not buying the babies jewelry.
We're buying them medicine.
Right now, we're low on NICU blankets.
That's baby blankets.
Don't tell me. Tell the board!
Hunt, where did my pro bono go?
Well, I took your advice about transfers...
So I found someone at Seattle Pres who could do it.
That is my patient.
Not anymore. Your patient is, uh...
Let's see... A gluteal liposuction?
With two lipos after that.
You can't just fill my day with--
Of course I can.
It's what a traffic cop does.
Gluteal lipo. So that's--
Sucking butt fat.
Is that part of the logo?
It's gotta be the source of all this blood.
Nope. There's blood coming from somewhere else,
superiorly.
We're gonna have to extend this incision. Scalpel?
Scalpel.
So I don't have to tell Dante, right?
I mean, I can just forget that she said it?
Murphy--
'Cause the brother's here now,
and it'll just ignite a family feud.
And maybe I heard her wrong.
What else sounds like "brother"?
"Mother"?
Oh, god.
She's gonna live, okay?
No. I know.
It's just, there's a big bleeder that we haven't found yet.
Murphy!
Are you gonna watch me eat?
No. Absolutely not.
What are you doin'?
Scavenging. NICU's low on blankets.
What are you doin'?
I have a painful erection that won't subside.
Oh. Not.... Not me.
Uh, cards.
My condition is priapism.
Major causes are sickle cell.
And...
Crap.
Leukemia.
I hope it goes away soon.
Uh, you know,
You can kick my friends out if you want to.
I mean, it's your house.
They shouldn't be there all the time.
No. Hey, uh...
Your--your friend died a week ago.
You guys should hang out or whatever.
Unless you're over it already.
No. I mean, I'm--I'm still really sad. Of course.
But, uh... um...
Look, I get it.
I...
I mean, they can crash however long they want.
You're being really great about this.
Really, really great.
Your mitral valve replacement?
A 17-year-old infant heart transplant recipient.
Karev doesn't think I should do it.
His E.F.'s only 25%.
Yeah, it sucks.
And there is a lot of scarring to get through.
Karev is right.
This kid should go straight on the transplant list.
It's risky,
but the parents want it, and so does the kid.
Sound like you're gonna go ahead then.
Well, good luck.
Thanks.
What?
Normally, I'd kiss you.
I'd wish you luck and then I'd kiss you.
Hey, you guys did couples therapy, right?
Was it good? Did it help?
I mean, obviously not, right? Look at you guys.
Uh, no offense.
Offense.
Well...
Torres.
What?!
The only way? No, no, no. No, you don't cut the clavicle!
No, don't do that without me!
Why would you do that?!
Because the
subclavian's bleeding like stink,
and we can't get to it.
She's bleeding out!
And she's bleeding out.
Okay, everybody out.
What?
Everybody out. Get out. Get out now! now!
Why? What?
Come on, get out! come on!
Get out! come on!
You do not cut a clavicle yourselves!
No! no!
She says "no."
I don't think I have a choice.
She doesn't have--
I can hear her! tell her I'm on my way!
She's on her way.
Excuse me!
What do we do?
B.P.'s dropping.
Give me the saw.
Here you go.
Oh, god.
What the hell did you just do?!
what part of "don't cut the clavicle"
do you not understand?
I fixed it.
Massive bleeder just under the right--
You made a clean cut down the middle.
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
to repair bone with this little surface area?
There was no way to do the repair without visibility.
Mm, no, there was no easy way.
And because you're careless and thoughtless,
that seemed prohibitive to you.
You think you can just do whatever you feel like in the moment,
and ortho will just put everything back the way
it's supposed to be.
She was dying!
No, just go. Let me clean up your mess.
Come on.
Promise me if it looks too gnarly
you'll just close him up.
Will you stop wringing your hands?
God. No wonder you can't have sex.
I can have sex.
I can have sex.
Are the hydraulics not working? I can write you a script.
Look, that's not... she's just...
bummed about her dead friend
and stressed about her exams.
Ugh. Those are not valid.
All right. There's been a lot of girls since Izzie.
A lot of nobodies.
But this girl is not a nobody.
She's... I don't know. When I think about it,
it just seems important. Like...
like it's gotta be the right time.
You want it to be special.
What?
Nothing. It's sweet.
Are you making fun of me?
I am not.
Can I ask you one thing? When we're done here,
will you braid my hair?
Oh, boy.
Mm. Last chance to turn back.
Scissors.
Here you go.
Of course I pissed him off.
But transferring my patient to some other hospital
just to spite me?
Seems extreme.
Yeah, he can't do it.
Yeah, he can. He's your boss.
No. I'm his boss. Right?
The board is his boss.
That's a jacked up system.
The system is actually fine.
It's just in this particular situation, it becomes--
Jacked up?
Complicated.
You know what's not complicated? This.
Unless I'm missing something,
you just suck the fat with that hose.
Well, pretty--pretty much.
Okay. And the next lipo will be just like this?
Oh, it's gonna be a different butt entirely.
Do you really need me here?
'cause everyone else is studying.
You said something about being with me all day.
Thought we were changing lives?
Yeah, but I also wanted to see the look on our patient's face.
Get out of here.
Thanks!
Is he asleep?
No. He hates sleep.
He's staring at the mobile.
I don't know how such a little kid...
can puke on so many things.
I don't know.
Are you asleep?
No.
Nobody's asleep. Are you asleep?
No, I'm too worried about Richard to sleep.
He needs an N.G. Tube,
and of course he doesn't want one.
And he's intimidating Bailey into not ordering one.
But that's what he needs.
He made me his family, and then I abandoned him.
It's just a mess over there.
Swallow study?
Okay, Ross, I can't read this. Take this.
Ross.
I know.
He's got a P.A.S. score of 6?
I know.
Okay, I'm a 60-year-old woman
with abdominal pain, a fever, and significant discharge.
My initial diagnosis is that you're gross.
You guys have gotta go.
No study hall at Alex's tonight.
But it's our spot. We're study buddies.
No, you are a freaking human chastity belt.
I know we've been grieving, but it's been a week.
I am all grieved out.
Ooh. Celibacy's made you mean.
Heather would understand. She'd want me to get laid.
Pushing it, but okay.
Okay, look, this is my last pair of clean, sexy underwear.
Then it's all granny panties until laundry day.
It has to be tonight.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What happened?!
I think she stroked out.
Push high dose EPI.
I already pushed high dose EPI.
Did you try vasopressin?
Kepner, she's been down for 15 minutes.
What?
No.
Time of death--1617.
Oh, dear god.
I'm sorry. I tried.
So, um...
What do I tell the husband?
You tell him...
We did everything we could,
but despite our best efforts, we---
not that part.
The part about how she slept with his brother.
He's about to hear that his wife is dead. I think that's enough.
Hang on.
The woman trusted you, Murphy.
She wanted him to know the truth.
It's his last memory of his wife.
Yeah, well, at least it'll be an honest one.
He deserves to know.
And you made a promise.
You're gonna tell him, and I'm gonna make sure you do.
What were you thinking?
Hey, what in god's name?
Ross showed me Richard's chart.
But you have staples in your body!
I took them out. I'm a skilled surgeon.
You have no pain?
I have a lot of pain. It's called sleep deprivation.
Richard is starving.
We have a plan.
"We" have a plan?
Yeah.
He's a patient here. He doesn't get to make decisions.
No. We do. We who are here. We who have the plan.
So why don't you go back home--
I will once I know he's okay.
He's not okay. And it isn't as simple
as sticking a feeding tube down his throat.
It is that simple.
We all know he can't get well unless he eats,
and he can't eat if he can't swallow.
You know as well as I do
that a feeding tube is psychologically devastating.
It takes away a man's dignity--
So does dying.
I really wanna talk to the radiologist
about the swallow study.
Well, fine. Let's go.
Okay.
What's in your hair?
Baby vomit.
Give me the damn stroller.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You have dysphagia and laryngeal edema.
Even if you could eat on your own, which you can't,
you're at risk for aspirating your food.
You need an N.G. Tube, or you're gonna starve.
And I'm not gonna let another one of us die.
You're an intern.
Don't talk to me like I don't know what's happening.
You're pretending like it isn't happening,
and Dr. Bailey's letting you.
Dr. Grey is here.
She came all this way with a baby,
and there's no way she's gonna leave
without forcing this thing through your nose
and into your stomach.
And I think you don't want her to be the one to do that.
I'm offering to take care of this right now.
Just you and me.
Avery, I have one more patient for you.
No, no, no. No more.
And I'm calling Cara McAdams first thing
and I'm doing the pro bono surgery,
and the board is gonna discuss your behavior.
Avery, Avery, look.
She's all set for you first thing tomorrow.
You said you transferred her.
I lied.
You lied?
Yeah, I-I just moved her.
So that means you decided that three liposuctions
were more important than this lady's facial re--
No, but the three lipos
will pay for this lady's facial reconstruction.
The money has to come from somewhere.
So, yeah, I lied, and now you have the money.
I...
Avery, I needed to make a point with you.
I know we're all doctors, and we're all busy,
But until the board members are willing to solve
the bigger budget problems caused by the storm,
the doctors' problems aren't going away.
So you need to do something now.
You are right.
Yeah. You all need to meet.
I can't force you to--
No, no. You can.
You're our boss, and you can lie.
He's in v-tach, Yang. You should stop.
They've all been short runs
and then they've all stopped. It's fine.
You gotta get over this "Special" thing.
Just throw her over your shoulder,
take her to bed, and go to town.
Every girl's dream.
She's the thing that's special, dumbass.
God, you have the right person right there.
You both want the same thing.
Wait. D-don't--don't-- don't go too deep.
Stop being scared.
This family is not scared. This boy is not scared.
I am not doing this because I want to.
I'm doing this because they asked me to and because I can.
What are you waiting for?
The arrhythmias are coming closer.
If I keep pushing, I'll send him into v-fib.
Even cannulating will destroy the heart
before I get to the valve.
You win. This kid needs a new heart.
Let's get out of here.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
You okay?
Just lost a patient,
And now I am waiting for more bad news.
Still haven't heard?
You know, when I failed last year,
I found out before I got home that night.
It's been 48 hours, and nothing.
I think if you fail twice,
they just stop talking to you and hope you get the hint.
I'm pretty sure that's not how it works.
It's them. It's here.
Good.
Me? I'm--no. I don't--
Please? I can't.
What?
Just...
Congratulations.
Yes!
Yes. Yes! Yes!
Thank you, god! Thank you!
That's... yes!
Like you said...
It's all you.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Your wife had a stroke during surgery.
She had a coagulation disorder,
which is why the clot formed so quickly.
We're so, so sorry for your loss.
She was just here.
She was laughing on the way here. She wanted me--
She wanted me to find out who won the game.
There is one other thing I need to tell you.
Before she went into surgery,
your wife wanted me to tell you--
That she loves you.
She told us to tell you that she loves you.
Thank you.
Shepherd?
Oh, have you seen my wife and baby?
Wait. Meredith's here?
Meredith.
Crap. I meant to text you.
I woke up to nothing and nobody.
The woman's wearing mismatched shoes. Cut her some slack.
I have to go check on Richard.
Send me a note next time.
You look like hell.
You know you're in a building full of beds.
I just need to go lie down.
Ross, what did you do?
You re supposed to wait until--
He was overdue for the tube,
and nobody seemed to wanna do it.
He was starving to death right in front of us,
so I did what had to be done.
There was so much scar tissue.
I'm afraid I-I couldn't get to the valve to repair it.
Michael has to go on the transplant list.
The transplant coordinator will be in
to ask you some questions.
Oh, god.
Look, the transplant list is not a death sentence.
It's a chance. It--it's hope that most people never get.
When Michael wakes up, he needs to hear that from you.
I know it's not what you wanted,
but now we have to move forward.
Michael needs the hope
that there is a donor out there somewhere,
or he won't survive.
You're up?
Barely. I got paged.
Me, too.
Well, who would page us? We're not even supposed to be here.
I was having the nicest dream.
Wait. You guys got a page?
God, what happened to the guy?
Apparently everything.
Hey, you were paged, too? Why outpatient surgery?
Well, it's a disaster area. Maybe someone got hurt.
I don't know.
It worked.
I cannot believe that that worked.
Uh, okay. Where's the trauma?
There's no trauma. This is a meeting of the board.
There's no trauma?
A meeting about what?
We're gonna have a party.
Is this--is this a trauma, a meeting or a party?
I'm so confused.
I'm so tired.
We're gonna have a party, folks.
A big one. Gala fund-raiser.
We're gonna invite the richest people that we know,
and we are gonna charm the money out of them.
But first, Dr. Hunt is gonna tell us
exactly how much money we need and where it needs to go,
starting with what used to be this room.
So... let's settle in. This is gonna take a while.
We have the house to ourselves.
But I want you to know
that just because I'm about to jump into bed with you
does not mean I'm an unfeeling slut
who isn't sad about Heather,
because I am sad.
I'm also very, very--
No more talking.
What?
Thank god!
Eventually, I'm gonna touch your arm,
and you are going to kiss me good luck before surgery.
Cristina.
Let's...
date other people.
Okay, it'll--it'll suck.
And it'll feel forced, but maybe it'll help.
Maybe eventually I won't want to take your hand
when we get off the elevator at the end of the day.
No, come on.
Don't.
Just tell me you'll try.
I'll try.
Okay.
Thank God. You came.
I've been wishing you hadn't told me...
And that we could go back to our life,
to being happy.
Except we weren't...
happy.
At least you weren't.
And so we do things like have sex with other people.
Callie, I made a mistake.
One mistake--
Yeah, I don't think it was a mistake.
I've been picturing you screwing that woman
over and over again. I-I can't...
Think about it or talk about her anymore.
I'm--I'm all done with that for right now.
So I'm... not going into that room.
But I think you should.
I think you need to.
In the game of mercy, when one kid cries out...
No.
the other one listens,
and the pain stops.
Please.
I really need to talk.
I really need you to-- to do this.
I know.
You wore the red dress and everything.
Don't you wish it was that easy now?
I'm sorry. I know I haven't been here.
You picked me as your family--
Stop it.
Stop it.
I didn't call you my family.
I'm not your father.
I chose you because I thought you could put emotion aside...
and make the right call.
I knew Bailey was too weak.
But you...
I thought I could trust...
Not to let them operate on me when I was all but...
when I was all but dead.
Not to bring me back to...
a life...
where I have to get my...
meals from a...
from a tube.
I thought you wouldn't be sentimental.
I was wrong.
I chose the wrong person.
It's not a game anymore,
And we're not kids.
You can cry "Mercy" all you want,
but nobody's listening.
It's just you...
