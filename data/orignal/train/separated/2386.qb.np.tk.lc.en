this was a murder .
someone drove this stake through his heart .
i would know if i were killing people .
you wear a ring that lets you cheat death , ric .
how many times can you die before it changes you ?
what are you doing here , sage ?
well , i heard finn was finally freed from that casket
your brother carted him around in .
he &apos;s my one true love .
esther &apos;s planning on killing her entire family .
she &apos;s linked them all together with a spell .
whatever happens to one happens to all of them .
it &apos;s not over , nik .
a white oak tree
300 years after we fled back to the old world .
that tree could kill us .
in 1912 , the salvatore milling company chopped down
an old white oak tree that was used to make the wickery bridge .
we have a weapon .
let &apos;s go kill some originals .
morning , sunshine .
how &apos;s alaric ?
indecent , but fine .
so then does that mean there were no issues last night ?
nope . slept like a baby .
woke up alaric .
no headlines about dead council members .
then why do i feel like you &apos;re hiding something from me ?
well , maybe because you &apos;re being all paranoid and control freak @-@ y .
what &apos;d you bring me ?
chocolate muffins . you know what they say--
the way to a psycho killer &apos;s heart is through his stomach .
they &apos;re not for you .
fine . keep convincing yourself you &apos;re still mad at me .
but sadly , ric &apos;s going to have to miss elena time today .
you know , lockdown and all .
just take it , give it to him and tell him that i miss him , ok ?
with pleasure .
please .
have a great day .
dam-
thanks for coming by .
walking down the stairs .
opening front door and ... she &apos;s gone .
needs to have a sharper point .
got it .
finally have our own stakes to kill an original .
i &apos;m not going to miss because you can &apos;t whittle .
i said i got it . stop micro managing .
looks like you guys got this under control .
i &apos;m going to call the sheriff .
i want to turn myself in .
no , you don &apos;t .
i have a homicidal alter ego .
unlike some people in this room ,
i would like to take responsibility for the people i &apos;ve killed .
if you wanted to turn yourself in ,
you wouldn &apos;t be saying it out loud . just sayin &apos; .
listen , of all the people , you cannot psychoanalyze me .
i killed caroline &apos;s father . i nearly killed meredith .
everything has changed .
you &apos;re not turning yourself in .
bonnie &apos;s herbs are working .
and we have originals to kill .
his morals get very questionable when he has revenge on the brain .
klaus needs to die , we finally have a chance to kill him .
so you are not turning yourself in .
here &apos;s your ring , ric .
put it on .
that ring is the reason i &apos;ve killed people .
it &apos;s also the reason you &apos;re alive .
you &apos;re going vampire hunting , ric .
wear it .
alaric saltzman killed my father ?
i can &apos;t expect you to be ok with this .
but at least these herbs that bonnie &apos;s giving him ,
they &apos;re healing him and they &apos;re keeping the dark side buried .
yeah , and that &apos;s supposed to make everything ok ?
no , caroline , it &apos;s not ok . it &apos;s horrible .
and i feel horrible about it ,
but ...
he &apos;s a victim of something supernatural .
he didn &apos;t ask for this .
it just happened to him .
just like bonnie &apos;s mom . i mean ,
she didn &apos;t ask to become a vampire .
and ... neither did stefan , or tyler .
or me .
or you .
none of you asked for this .
but who would i be if i just ...
turned my back on any of you ?
oh , elena gilbert .
savior of the cursed and the damned .
hey . what &apos;s with the , uh , cryptic secret meeting text ?
i don &apos;t know . stefan just said to meet here .
where &apos;s bonnie ? texted her , too .
uh , bonnie &apos;s mom bailed on her . again .
so i think we should leave her out of this one .
what are we doing here ?
we found some more white oak . long story .
wait for the movie .
hang on .
white oak ?
you have a weapon that can kill klaus ?
nope . we all have a weapon .
hello , finn .
hello , niklaus .
i have nothing to say to you .
i &apos;m not here to chat . i will ask you one time ,
though , where &apos;s our mother ?
gone to find another way to end our abominable lives .
and when she does , i will sacrifice myself all over again .
how fortunate that i found you .
i require your assistance .
i have no wish to help you . only to see you dead .
well , that &apos;s the thing . you see , you won &apos;t be able to see me dead
because if i die , then you die ,
so it &apos;s a wish unfulfilled .
oh , bother someone else
with your hollow charms , niklaus .
why ?
when i can bother my big brother ?
i need you to accompany me back to mystic falls .
i have a witch there who can help undo esther &apos;s spell
that linked us together .
i have no wish to be unlinked !
again with the wishes .
let me rephrase-- you will come back with me
or i will put you back in
that coffin in which you rotted for 900 years .
what happens to one happens to all .
you may not feel the effects of the dagger ,
but you &apos;d lose your precious rebekah .
wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
let &apos;s not make this any worse than it has to be , darling brother .
you &apos;re siding with him ?
rebekah , he stored us in boxes .
at least he &apos;s not trying to make us extinct .
what are you going to do ? kill me ?
oh , yeah , that &apos;s right , you &apos;ve got a death wish .
fine . pathetic , but fine . the thing is ,
i &apos;m not going to have you take the rest of us down with you .
klaus has always been one step ahead of us .
but now we have the advantage .
we &apos;re all armed , and they are all linked .
meaning we only need to kill one of them .
we need to seize the best opportunity ,
which means we need to prepare for every opportunity .
scenario number one--
you are to play klaus .
ok .
rebekah is our target .
so we &apos;ll distract her and catch her off guard .
to do that , we need to keep klaus separate
and occupied .
caroline .
why do i always have to be klaus bait ?
because he &apos;s obsessed with you . but for right now ,
we need you to play rebekah .
we &apos;ll use the quarterback to distract her . just keep her talking .
how ?
act interested .
she &apos;s lonely . desperate .
clearly .
she slept with you .
beefcake holds bombshell , i come up from behind her ,
grab her arms like this ...
which gives me time for one shot .
got it ? good .
so we all have one stake , we keep it hidden
and we look out for any opportunity we have .
no last minute attacks of pity for any of them .
don &apos;t worry about me .
not after what happened to bonnie &apos;s mom .
barbie ?
oh , i &apos;m ready .
anything that will free tyler of his sire bond to klaus .
bus boy ?
do i have a choice ?
good point .
we have 12 stakes .
12 shots at killing one original .
we can do this .
all right , let &apos;s try another scenario .
elena , grab a crossbow . matt , you play klaus .
gather your witch .
let &apos;s get his blood and get on with it .
you can &apos;t force me to help you .
oh , i most likely could .
but why force when i can persuade ?
hello , finn .
sage !
what do you know ?
true love prevails .
it does occasionally have its uses .
easier than torturing him .
i have something to do .
what do you need from me for this spell ?
just your blood and your blessing . where are you going ?
i have some unfinished business with damon salvatore .
ask sage what he did to me .
and you &apos;ll understand why retribution is in order .
i mean , did you learn
nothing from the moon stone in the soap dish ?
why ? where &apos;d you put yours ?
what the hell was that ?
ric ?
hello , lover .
bonnie , we &apos;re starting to worry about you .
call me back . or call caroline .
just call someone , please .
mr. saltzman was like the most normal guy in town .
is it weird that bonnie &apos;s not returning my calls ?
is it weird that klaus &apos; brother is in the middle of town square ?
that &apos;s finn . i thought he left town .
so can you guess why i dragged you out here ?
if memory serves me , this is where the natives
used to make sacrifices to their gods .
this statue was built where we used to rendezvous .
back when you used to have
to sneak away from your siblings to see your
tawdry lady friend .
i assumed after 900 years you &apos;ve moved on .
i took care of myself .
but i never stopped loving you , finn .
i don &apos;t want you to die .
hey , where are you ?
i just got home . why ?
klaus &apos; brother finn is in the town square .
he &apos;s with some ex @-@ girlfriend or something .
ex @-@ girlfriend ? guy &apos;s been in a coffin for the last 900 years .
sage . it &apos;s got to be sage .
we have an opportunity .
so how do we do this ?
listen to me , elena .
do not do anything , ok ?
sage is very old and very strong .
you don &apos;t stand a chance against her .
then get damon and get down here .
what the hell happened to you ?
stefan ...
rebekah happened .
i think we have a problem .
i found them in the shed .
what kind of monster would trap a poor , defenseless animal ?
got to admit , even for me ,
it &apos;s a little kinky .
you pretended to be interested in me .
and then you slept with me so your trampy friend sage
could steal my thoughts . ever since then ,
i &apos;ve felt this incessant need to one @-@ up you .
so i &apos;ve decided to bleed the vervain from your system .
you want to compel me to be your boyfriend ?
actually , i &apos;d rather compel you to kill your brother .
or elena . but , since vampires heal ,
bleeding you may take a while .
we should probably stick to the major arteries .
look what you caught .
if you &apos;re trying to bleed him of vervain ,
don &apos;t you think it would be easier to hang him upside down ?
i &apos;m perfectly capable of inflicting pain , thank you very much .
oh , well , excuse me .
it &apos;s not like i have any expertise in the matter .
you know , why don &apos;t you just leave me be
and go and manage your witch ?
mmm . now , where were we ?
tick tock . i should hear chanting by now .
i &apos;m still studying the unlinking spell .
it &apos;s not that easy , especially under duress .
you &apos;ve been warned .
if you &apos;re looking for a way to send for help ,
i will kill anyone who comes to your rescue .
this is the spell . i just don &apos;t know if i &apos;m strong enough .
then you should have a little more faith in yourself , bonnie .
your energy helped my mother link us .
honestly , i think someone isn &apos;t trying very hard .
very well .
kol .
how &apos;s the weather up there in mile high city ?
and how &apos;s our friend ?
may i see him .
there &apos;s jeremy .
playing fetch with his new puppy .
isn &apos;t that just the most adorable thing you &apos;ve ever seen ?
thank you , kol .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
so , bonnie .
how about that spell ?
i hear you had a run in with buffy the vampire .
yeah , i &apos;ll live .
what are you doing here ?
checking up on you .
in case you &apos;re ... not you .
i &apos;m me .
i guess not @-@ you would say that , too .
which is why ...
elena said you have to drink this .
i hope it tastes better than it smells .
it doesn &apos;t .
that &apos;s disgusting .
it &apos;s either that or kill people , so ...
elena told me everything .
caroline ...
i am so sorry .
i don &apos;t even know what else i can say .
right after i turned into a vampire ,
i killed someone .
a stranger . i just ...
killed him .
and what &apos;s worse is ,
i liked it .
i have blood on my hands , too .
you know , we all do .
yeah , but the blood on my hands is your father &apos;s .
yeah , it is . and maybe the guy
i killed was someone &apos;s father , too .
look ...
all i know is , i &apos;m no better than you .
so i &apos;m going to take a page
from the elena gilbert handbook
and choose to believe that you can be saved .
ok ?
ok .
how is he ?
he &apos;s just banged up .
caroline &apos;s going to stay with him ;
make sure alaric stays alaric .
matt texted me , he said finn is still in the grill .
we need to plan our next move .
wait , wait , rebekah has damon .
our next move should be finding him .
no , we need to stay on point .
see an original , kill an original .
that &apos;s the plan .
yeah , that was the plan
before damon &apos;s life was hanging in the balance .
look , elena , i understand
that you &apos;re concerned about my brother &apos;s life ,
but if he even knew for one second
that we were talking about missing a chance to kill these people ,
he would lose his mind .
yeah , and if the roles were reversed ,
he would stop everything to save you .
i know what my brother would want .
what he would want and what we should do
are two different things .
you going to help me with this or not ?
ok . i &apos;ll figure it out myself .
what are you doing ?
rebekah will kill you .
then hurry up and-- and tell me what to do .
open .
carefully .
come on , come on .
we have to keep going , damon .
i need a minute .
no , look at me . look at me .
leave me to die , elena .
i am not going to leave you .
damon ?
no !
damon . drink .
drink .
bitch .
it &apos;s not fun when someone messes with your thoughts , is it ?
actually , i was having a pretty good time in there .
well , i hope you were nicer to elena than you are to me .
oh , come on .
i couldn &apos;t hurt you that bad .
you didn &apos;t think i really had a thing for you , did you ?
i get it .
klaus bossed me around for a thousand years ,
i &apos;d probably be pretty desperate for attention , too .
who was that ?
i wouldn &apos;t let it bother you , love .
well , it does bother me .
you bother me .
the way you use people to get what you want .
it &apos;s not right .
you &apos;re being emotional , bonnie .
i understand that things have been rough for you .
you know , with your mother leaving . again .
it &apos;s very sad .
i can help you find her .
if you want .
i have people who can find people .
i could bring her back to you .
or , if you choose ,
i can just bring parts of her back .
but isn &apos;t it obvious
that i &apos;m just going to continue to hurt the people you love
until you do the spell .
now , i know it &apos;s in the grimoire ,
and i know it requires the blood of my siblings .
so . here we are .
elijah , rebekah , kol , finn .
where do you want us ?
you &apos;ve never had tequila before ?
that &apos;s embarrassing .
seriously , i &apos;m embarrassed for you .
happy now ?
i &apos;m truly awed by the evolution of mankind .
hey , sage .
hey , troy .
you know him ?
i turned him .
you turned him . why ?
because i &apos;m in enemy territory .
when your brother and sister called , i thought i might need
a little back @-@ up . you can &apos;t trust anyone here .
two more tequilas ?
all right , cool ,
i &apos;ll let your waitress know .
thanks .
how many people have you turned ?
i don &apos;t know . a lot .
don &apos;t judge me , finn . you turned me .
exactly , sage . i turned you .
my passion overtook my morals .
my passions overtake my morals on a daily basis .
it &apos;s called living life to the fullest .
finally .
thanks .
to living life to the fullest .
to living life .
ahh ! oh , what the hell !
vervain !
finn , the stake !
no !
no , finn , no !
oh , leaving so soon ?
sister .
be nice .
thank you , bonnie .
see you in physics class .
oh , my god .
yeah , you &apos;ll have to excuse the mess .
apparently damon hurt her feelings .
bonnie ...
go on . help him .
save the man who turned your mother into a vampire .
just get me out of here .
very well .
how &apos;s alaric ?
he &apos;ll be ok .
i gave him a bottle of bonnie &apos;s herbs ,
and he went home .
oh , did you guys kill finn ? did it work ?
nothing worked until i see klaus &apos; dead body myself .
bonnie , where have you been ?
klaus has damon .
kl--klaus should be dead .
they should all be dead . we just killed finn .
no , elena . he forced me
to do a spell that unlinked all the siblings .
he &apos;s still alive .
ok , bonnie .
where &apos;s damon ?
at klaus &apos; mansion . it &apos;s bad , elena .
he threatened jeremy . and my mom ...
are--are you ok ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sorry , i have to go .
i just-- i have to-- i have to go .
no , bonnie , just--
stay with caroline , i &apos;ll call you when it &apos;s over .
stefan , stop . klaus is stronger than you .
we need another plan .
no , what we need is for klaus to be dead .
stefan , stop it ! you &apos;re acting on anger !
anger gets things done , elena .
or it &apos;ll get you killed .
and it &apos;ll get damon killed along with you .
klaus does not get to survive this .
not after everything he took from me .
i miss well @-@ adjusted stefan .
ding dong .
i &apos;m not here for you . i &apos;m here for him .
i don &apos;t think so .
i had to kill him , sage .
oh . you remember me .
good .
then you know i like to go all ten rounds .
sage ?
troy , help me !
what is happening to me ?
she just died .
so sage and this troy guy die within an hour of finn .
but why ? were they bitten by a hybrid , or ...
hybrid bites don &apos;t look like that .
maybe sage was so in love with finn ,
she just died of sadness .
no , that doesn &apos;t explain troy .
it &apos;s the blood . the bloodline .
it has to be . think about it . finn turned sage ,
sage turned troy .
they &apos;re all part of the same vampire bloodline
that originated with finn .
wait , so , when an original dies ,
every vampire turned in their bloodline dies along with them ?
because ... that would mean ...
if the originals die ,
so do all of you .
the entire vampire species would ...
just be dead .
this was much different in my head .
klaus ! i &apos;m here !
let &apos;s do this .
oh , good . a hero .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m here to make a deal .
stefan , what are you doing ?
eight stakes , made of white oak .
the part of wickery bridge that you forgot to burn .
that &apos;s impossible .
actually , it &apos;s not .
finn &apos;s dead .
you killed my brother ?
damon in exchange for the last eight weapons that could kill you .
and how do we know there aren &apos;t any more left ?
because there aren &apos;t .
let &apos;s be certain , shall we ?
leave .
no .
come on . leave .
nik , he &apos;s my play thing , not yours .
i said ... go
home .
vampire disposal ...
not my strong suit .
ugh . where did stefan go ?
trading the stakes for damon .
all of them ?
no . not all of them .
we still have , uh ,
enough to kill three out of the four of them .
if we can figure out who to save .
oh . how are we supposed to do that ?
i have no idea .
you were turned with damon &apos;s blood
and damon and stefan were turned by katherine ,
and we know that katherine was turned
by a vampire named rose .
well , who turned rose ?
we don &apos;t know .
but it can only lead back to one original ,
and if the odds are in our favor ,
hopefully it won &apos;t be klaus .
so we can still kill him .
elena ...
even if klaus didn &apos;t create our bloodline ...
we know for a fact that
he turned one of us .
oh , my god .
tyler .
if we kill klaus , then tyler will die .
all right , stop .
stop . stop , before you hurt yourself .
i can see that you can finally be compelled .
now .
minus the stake that &apos;s in my brother ,
how many more stakes are out there that can kill me ?
11 .
11 ! really ?
so not eight , then .
you really shouldn &apos;t have lied .
i &apos;ll get you the other three .
yeah , that would be nice .
or since you lied ,
maybe i &apos;ll just compel your brother
to chew out his own tongue .
what is wrong with you ?
what is wrong with you ? !
do you really have no appreciation for me ?
i have given you someone to hate ;
to loathe , a target for all of your anger .
so you don &apos;t have to turn it on yourself .
i have given your life purpose as your friend .
i really think you should be thanking me .
step down
or you &apos;ll both die .
there .
now you &apos;ll only have to get me the other two .
this is ridiculous .
what are you doing ?
i brought him here .
i get to release him .
my rules now .
bring us the stakes and you both live .
take your brother as a sign of good faith .
bring us the stakes .
all of them .
or i &apos;ll wage a war against everyone you love .
i hope i &apos;m being clear .
i can &apos;t believe finn is dead .
good riddance .
he was an embarrassment , rebekah .
he was still your brother . mind your tongue .
fine . let &apos;s all say a prayer for finn ,
who slept in a box longer than he lived as man .
he was a lovesick fool . he &apos;s better off in death .
is that how you would speak of me if i died ?
well , you let the salvatores lose
with two stakes that could kill us ,
so i guess we &apos;ll find out soon enough .
and since when did you have a soft spot for them ?
the salvatores may fight like dogs ,
but in the end , they would die for each other .
at least they know what family means .
you destroyed ours .
i wanted a family .
they just didn &apos;t want me .
and now we &apos;re unlinked .
we &apos;re no longer responsible for each other .
so , what , are you leaving ?
as soon as i get my stakes , i &apos;m gone .
i &apos;m going to take elena and use her blood
to create a new family of hybrids .
and if i choose to stay ?
then you &apos;re just as pathetic as finn .
you haven &apos;t said much since you got back home .
i &apos;ll be a ball of sunshine once damon
gets alaric &apos;s stake back . promise .
you really scared me today .
you wouldn &apos;t have survived if you went up
against klaus on your own .
you know that , right ?
well , you don &apos;t have to worry about that anymore .
why ?
because he &apos;s not worth it .
all this time and energy that i &apos;ve wasted hating him .
it was for nothing .
it &apos;s done . it &apos;s over .
we lost .
i &apos;m right back where i started .
that &apos;s not true .
yeah , klaus dragged you through hell .
but you came out the other side .
you beat him by being better than him .
and what did i lose in the process ?
look , hating klaus was easy .
it allowed me to ignore
everything that was happening around me .
everything i let slip away .
now i have to deal with that .
stefan ...
no , just admit it .
admit it to me , elena . i know you don &apos;t owe it to me ,
but i just need to hear you say it .
i--i can &apos;t .
because it &apos;s not true .
stefan ... i never stopped loving you .
i know that . i know you didn &apos;t .
even though i did ...
everything possible to push you away .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s all my fault . i mean , this was all my fault .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the fact
that you &apos;re also in love with damon .
what ?
no . stefan , i was just .
i love you .
i will always love you .
i just want you to look me in the eye and tell me ...
that you don &apos;t feel something for him .
i don &apos;t know what i feel .
oh , you &apos;re still alive .
yeah , for now .
i need your stake .
it &apos;s right behind these books here .
a bookshelf , really ?
at least i was trying to be clever about it .
where the hell is it ?
haha . look harder , ric .
it &apos;s not here , damon .
maybe you just forgot
what shelf you put it on .
no , i didn &apos;t forget it . it &apos;s--i put it right here .
a stake doesn &apos;t just vanish into thin air !
who else did you tell , ric ?
i didn &apos;t tell anybody , damon . i &apos;m the only--
what ?
i &apos;m the only one who knew about it , damon .
are you telling me that your vampire hating alter ego
has a stake that could kill an entire line of vampires ,
possibly mine ?
