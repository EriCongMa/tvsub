the one where phoebe runs
i just finished this fascinating book .
by the year 2030 , there &apos;ll be computers ...
that can carry out the same amount of functions as a human brain .
so , theoretically , you could download ... your thoughts and memories
into this computer
and live forever as a machine .
and i just realized i can sleep with my eyes open .
honey , it was a great idea , nailing the boxes to the floor .
i didn &apos;t nail the boxes to the floor .
so you can move them !
and while i &apos;m doing that ,
ross has a great computer story for you .
hey , everybody ! i &apos;d like you to meet janine .
she &apos;s gonna be my new roommate !
elle macpherson
hi
and she &apos;s gonna live with me !
it &apos;s nice to meet you . janine ... ?
le croix .
i didn &apos;t know that . what a pretty last name .
so where are you from ?
australia . i just moved here .
from the land down under ? i didn &apos;t know that either !
so what do you do ?
i &apos;m a dancer .
you &apos;re a dancer ?
she &apos;s a dancer !
i think i &apos;ll go unpack .
joey
did you interview her before you asked her to move in ? of course !
what did you ask her ? when can you move in ?
thank you for bringing her into our lives .
unbelievable.down , boy .
oh , no , no , no . she &apos;s not my type . not for me , she &apos;s not my type . she &apos;s too ..
beautiful , tall , sexy , showing her stomach ?
look at all the boxes !
i cannot wait to ask her out .
wait a minute . you can &apos;t . she &apos;s your roommate .
it &apos;ll be too complicated.yeah , don &apos;t do it .
i mean , if you date her , then i can &apos;t date her .
what if you started going out with her and it didn &apos;t work out ? that &apos;s when i make my move .
remember when you broke up with donna ...
how horrible it was when you bumped into her at the supermarket ?
oh , god , yeah .
now imagine you live at the supermarket.okay !
no
you &apos;re right ! i don &apos;t want that . i can &apos;t date her .
you &apos;d better watch the flirting too , because it could be trouble .
well , that &apos;s gonna be tough , mon.it &apos;s hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt .
you &apos;re around me all the time , and you don &apos;t flirt .
a little sad about that , sweetie ?
i have to tie my shoes , so you go ahead . i &apos;ll catch up .
come on , that &apos;s not running ! let &apos;s go !
i &apos;m telling you , when she runs ... she looks like kermit the frog and the six million dollar man .
monica had such a crush on him .
she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed .
i used to do that too !
did you also have his album , &quot; it &apos;s not easy being green &quot; ?
oh , mon .
so phoebe runs weird , huh ?
yeah . and i know she &apos;ll want to run again.i don &apos;t know how to get out of it . i mean , i live with her .
why don &apos;t you be straight with her ? tell her the truth .
you &apos;re right . i should just tell her the truth .
phoebe , monica tripped me . i don &apos;t think i can ever run again , ever !
but we were having so much fun . all those cute guys were checking us out .
i know . they were definitely staring .
why ? why would you do that ? i don &apos;t know .
rachel , i &apos;m sorry i hurt your ankles .
ankle .
we &apos;ll see .
okay . i am officially unpacked.thanks for helping me , man .
joe ?
well , i guess joey went home .
and look , there is still one box i have to unpack .
i got you !
oh , my god , you almost gave me a heart attack .
it was so hard not to laugh .
hey , the place looks great.not bad , right ? monica &apos;s working late ,
so i &apos;m gonna make this place spotless .
you know what else i &apos;ll do ? i &apos;m gonna go downstairs and get her some flowers .
who wouldn &apos;t want to live with me ? i don &apos;t .
no , i want to live with the super @-@ hot australian dancer !
how &apos;s that going ? are you okay with the not @-@ flirting thing ?
so far . but it &apos;s tough .
i &apos;ve got this built @-@ up flirting energy , and i don &apos;t know how to get rid of it .
how you doing ?
get out !
oh , man !
sorry . there &apos;s just more room out here .
no , you just reminded me that i have to do my stretches too .
why don &apos;t you try to be ... ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing.i didn &apos;t want you to touch me ... because i &apos;m all sweaty from the workout .
i &apos;m gonna hit the shower .
oh , my god !
sorry about that stuff hanging in there.it &apos;s just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer .
oh , yeah , it &apos;s me.i saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out .
you lied so you could run by yourself .
no , phoebe , no . i was ....
i was actually just checking ... to see ... if i could run . and i can !
please , i &apos;m not an idiot.no , wait . phoebe ?
wow . couples who live together do start to look alike .
i am working right now . so say what you have to say and leave me alone !
sound alike too .
so , mondler ....
what are you doing ? what does it look like ? i am cleaning .
did you get monica &apos;s authorization to move all her stuff ?
i don &apos;t need that . i &apos;ll put everything back .
put it back exactly where you found it ?
yes . i &apos;m gonna put it back exactly where i found it .
first of all , that attitude is not helping .
she won &apos;t care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place .
hello ? did you just meet monica ?
she &apos;ll recognize that i did a nice thing ... and appreciate it .
actually , this will work out well .
because when you move back with joey ... joey &apos;s hot new roommate can come live with me .
oh , i see . you &apos;re trying to freak me out .
chandler , monica is really weird about this kind of stuff , all right ?
believe me , i lived with her for 16 years . she &apos;s going to freak out .
oh , my god . she &apos;s going to sit on you .
that probably won &apos;t hurt as much anymore .
no , she is not . i &apos;ll prove it to you.i &apos;ll call her right now .
phone &apos;s done .
hey , mon . how &apos;s it going ?
terrible .
if i want something done right , i have to do it myself.other people just wreck stuff .
i think i might kill someone tonight .
come on , it can &apos;t be that bad .
it &apos;s worse.the only thing getting me through ... is knowing i &apos;ll see you soon .
i might even try to get out of here early .
it sounds like they need you there .
you &apos;re just hanging out with ross ?
it &apos;s all good ! okay , bye !
she &apos;s gonna kill me .
the phone was facing the other way .
and that goes back up there .
this is good . this is under control .
we should start with the big stuff.that &apos;ll be the easiest .
let &apos;s start with the couch .
i got it .
that doesn &apos;t look right .
what are you talking about ? the couch is in line with the carpet .
then i can just walk over here and casually put my feet up on ....
okay , here &apos;s what we do.we move the couch closer to the coffee table .
but then the back of the couch won &apos;t line up with the carpet .
well , we &apos;ll just move the coffee table ... closer to the couch .
but then the coffee table won &apos;t be centered in the seating area .
but the coffee table doesn &apos;t match the table !
look , what am i gonna do ?
i &apos;m not flirting , but i &apos;m drawing her to me like a moth to a flame !
what the hell &apos;s going on over here ?
monica &apos;s gonna kill you !
i need your help.i have to do something to repel this woman .
wait a minute . wait a minute.you guys repel women all the time !
hey , i &apos;ve been married three times .
no , i &apos;ve seen it happen .
you get a rapport going with a woman , but somehow you manage to kill it .
time after time after time after time .
what &apos;s your secret ?
we do not repel women , okay ? that is completely untrue .
oh , yes , we do , my man .
remember when we went to a dance ... and you walked up to that girl you liked
and talked ... about the lrish potato famine ?
what about you ? you weren &apos;t so hot either .
after everything he said , he &apos;d go ..
monica doesn &apos;t like that either . i should stop doing that .
girls don &apos;t like it when i start talking about science.that &apos;s not specific to girls .
this is great . what else ?
they don &apos;t like you correcting their grammar .
and they don &apos;t like it when you explain why your jokes are funny .
they don &apos;t like it when you keep asking them if they like you .
man , i am so lucky i have monica .
i &apos;m never gonna find love again .
can i talk to you for a second ?
sure .
okey , um , i ...
phoebe , i just wanted to say i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i handled the situation horribly.and i should not have lied to you .
so what should you have done ?
i should have told you the truth .
which is ?
well , the reason i didn &apos;t want to go running with you is ... because ...
the way that you run is just a little ....
so ?
it &apos;s embarrassing.people were looking at us like we were crazy .
why do you care ?
because they &apos;re people !
people you don &apos;t know and will never see again .
yes , but still they are people ... with eyes
i didn &apos;t get embarrassed running next to miss ....
but okay.i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you .
okay . you &apos;re uptight .
what ? i am not uptight .
i am not uptight , man .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m not judging you . that &apos;s just who you are .
i &apos;m more free , you know . i run like i did when i was a kid ...
because that &apos;s the only way it &apos;s fun , you know ?
didn &apos;t you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off ...
like when you were running towards the swings or running away from satan ?
the neighbor &apos;s dog .
is this in the right place ? who cares ? i repel women .
you can &apos;t come in here ! ross is naked !
what ?
i couldn &apos;t say i was naked , because she &apos;s allowed to see me naked .
why does anyone have to be naked ?
why is ross naked ?
i had to show chandler something .
naked ?
i guess i have ... a &quot; guy &quot; problem .
is it the same thing chandler had ?
we &apos;ll get everything squared away , and you can come back later !
there &apos;s still some of chandler &apos;s medicine in the bathroom .
bye . -bye !
thank god .
dude , what &apos;d you have ?
we have no time , okay ? we must focus.we &apos;ve got to get everything back into its original place .
the photo album ! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album .
we just match everything to the pictures !
that &apos;s perfect ! that &apos;s brilliant !
what &apos;d you have ?
i &apos;ve got some beer for you .
don &apos;t you mean &quot; for whom &quot; ?
sure .
i was gonna order some pizza . you wanna share one ?
pizza ? it &apos;s not like i never had that before .
is something wrong ? yeah . i &apos;m depressed about that irish potato famine .
no , i mean with me . because you seem to be acting really weird around me .
all right , all right.let &apos;s just get this out in the open , okay ?
you &apos;re hot.i &apos;m lovable .
clearly , there &apos;s a vibe going on between us.but we &apos;re roommates ...
and it &apos;s a huge mistake for us to continue down this road .
joey ... no , no , no , i &apos;m telling ya
imagine living in a supermarket ... and you &apos;ll understand .
okay ? so the question is , what do we do ?
there isn &apos;t anything to do.i think you &apos;re really sweet .
but i &apos;m not interested in you like that .
no , i mean ....
you &apos;re a nice guy , and i &apos;m happy to be your roommate and your friend .
i &apos;m just , you know , i just ... don &apos;t feel that way about you .
i see what happened .
it &apos;s because i was trying to repel you .
right ? believe me , you &apos;d feel a lot different if i turned it on .
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , i do .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m okay .
what ?
what ?
oh , dear god !
i &apos;m so sorry . you &apos;re right . this feels great !
and you don &apos;t care if people stare . it &apos;s only a second . then you &apos;re gone !
it &apos;s amazing ! i feel so free and so graceful !
watch out for the horse .
can i come in now ?
why is everything different ?
bye .
i don &apos;t see anything different ... other than the fact that the room got brighter when you came into it .
the end table is wrong , the couch looks bizarre ... and don &apos;t even get me started on the refrigerator magnets .
okay , don &apos;t be mad , okay ? after i unpacked the boxes , i wanted to do something nice for you ...
so i cleaned the apartment .
so i moved everything around , and then i forgot ... where it went back .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m very sorry , i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s okay.are you afraid of me or something ?
do you want me to be afraid of you ?
of course not .
my gosh , chandler , what you did is a wonderful thing ... and i really appreciate it .
i have this thing where i want everything in the perfect place.but i &apos;d never expect you to worry about that .
really ? of course .
oh , you &apos;re the best.you come here to me .
hold on , okay ? first things first .
did ross sit anywhere while he was naked ?
it said that by the year 2030 ...
there &apos;ll be computers carrying out the same number of functions ... as an actual human brain .
so , theoretically , you could download your thoughts ... and your memories into this computer ..
and live forever as a machine .
janine , do you know what we &apos;re doing right now ?
you and i , we &apos;re interfacing .
