第七季 第一集
总监 夕橙橙
All right, let's go. Get on in here.
Come on. All I need is Wednesday.
Then give me Monday.
That is shoplifting day.
I make half my nut on shoplifting day.
Come on, Lucca, help me out here.
Not in a million years, Don.
What happened to "Bar attorneys stick together"?
When have bar attorneys ever stuck together?
Hey, someone's got money.
DUI in the suit.
No, nervous kid on the end.
It's a drug lawyer.
Hey, is that, um...?
Yeah.
What's she doing here?
She tried to steal an election.
Where else would she go?
Bar attorney?
Yeah.
Back row.
Ah. Sorry.
It's my first day.
Really? Wouldn't have guessed.
Alicia Florrick.
We know.
I voted for you.
Oh. Sorry about that.
I have a crammed lockup today,
so let's all work together,
and we'll get through this with some alacrity.
How many bar attorneys do I have?
Gentlemen, you have three bar attorneys here for you today.
They've been approved by the Chicago
Bar Association to help with the non-indigents.
That means you.
Congratulations, gentlemen. You may think you're poor,
but you are not poor enough to have a public defender.
So you have the option of hiring one of these three.
Four.
Just so you know, you're under no obligation to hire them.
Bar attorneys are merely a convenience for you
and for the court so we can dispense with your case today.
If you want to find your own attorney,
you will have to do so tonight after the bond hearing,
which will, of course, push your hearing to tomorrow.
Still, it's up to you. Do you understand?
I don't get involved
with the fee, so make your arrangements with them.
Ms. Quinn, you have 12 defendants.
Males 114 to 125.
Mr. Bukovitz, eight.
126 to 133. Come on.
Mr. Weingarten, ten.
134 to 143.
Lyndquist?
All right, Matan.
Mr.Lyndquist.
I'll look through these in order
of importance.
You have kids? Mr. Hocker?
Start with misdemeanors.
Are you employed, Mr. Lyndquist?
Witnesses put you at the scene of the crime.
Is that what we got here?
This is the third time in two years.
Yes, Your Honor.
You have kids?
Is your wife here? At the back?
In the corner.
Excuse me, am I supposed to check in with someone?
What?
Well, the judge-- he didn't include me.
Oh, yeah, I saw that.
Let's put them at the bottom of the stack
and get this party started.
Your Honor, excuse me.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm Alicia Florrick.
I'm on my way to lunch, Ma'am.
Yes, sir, but I just wanted you to know
that I am available as a bar attorney.
Yes, I get that.
Thank you.
I fought over 45 criminal cases, Your Honor.
Yes, and you were partner at Florrick-Agos,
and your husband is governor, and you ran for State's Attorney.
I'm aware of it.
Then you know I'm capable, sir.
Of winning cases. So?
I have 350 cases a day to process.
That's a case every 90 seconds.
And if I fall behind, I hear from the chief justice.
I won't hold you up, sir.
Yes, you will.
You're play-acting.
The other bar attorneys in there--
they need the money, they're hungry.
I have kids in college.
I don't share finances with my husband.
You were a partner in a top firm.
Yes.
And I can't get a job since... since the scandal.
I can't help you, ma'am.
The last thing I need in my courtroom is a Marie Antoinette.
I'm not a Marie Antoinette.
Your ride, Mrs. Florrick.
From Mr. Canning.
He wants to take you to lunch.
No.
I didn't ask it yet.
It's the same answer as before. I don't want to work for you.
Work with me.
I don't want to work with you.
Why not?
You're the devil.
I-I... I thought you liked me.
I do like you, but I don't like your cases.
I don't like who you defend.
Tobacco, pharmaceuticals.
Alicia, I've looked into your finances,
and you made a bad deal on your exit agreement.
You're doing grunt work as a bar attorney for $135 a case.
Thank you for lunch, Mr. Canning.
Now wait.
All I'm saying is, there's no honor in starting over.
For the first time in my life,
I don't have to answer to anyone.
It's just me.
Have you read Milan Kundera?
What? No.
I have... in the hospital,
'cause, um, I had a lot of time.
Two people bump into each other on a sidewalk...
and it's nobody's fault, just a complete accident.
One person instinctively says, "I'm sorry."
And the other says, "Watch it!"
Okay?
You're the apologizer.
And for no good reason.
Because you're a woman who occupies space on this planet?
That's why you should work for me.
Let the devil teach you how to say, "Watch it."
You just let it slip.
"Work for me."
I don't want to work for you.
I don't want to answer for anyone else.
What?
You-you seem like you're gonna launch into a...
Would you excuse me, please?
...inspiring soliloquy about self-sufficiency.
Alicia. What's up?
Peter should run.
What?
I said, I think Peter should run.
Eli?
Uh, y-y-yes.
I just have to put a few things into operation.
Why? Why-why... Why are you changing your mind?
I realized I was deciding things for Peter,
and I'm through with people making decisions for me.
You're snapping fingers at me.
I don't know what snapping fingers means.
Get Ruth on the line! Ruth Eastman!
Is Grace okay with this?
Grace has always been okay with it. It was me.
You will be involved?
It depends what you need.
Tomorrow we need to declare.
I'll get us a TV interview.
After 5.
I'll call you back.
You're in.
Alicia?
Yeah.
We've got to get moving fast!
Why? What did she say?
Oh, something about not wanting to speak for you,
or something eloquent.
We've got to make a play for Ruth Eastman.
She's the miracle worker of Iowa,
and she won't work with Hillary.
Eastman's leaving her office right now.
She asked to call you tomorrow.
No.
Tell her I'm coming to her.
Tell her not to leave! She's fielding offers.
We got to get ours in quick.
I haven't decided yet, sir.
No, I think you have a very good chance.
You said you wouldn't leave.
Can I call you back, sir?
Who's that? O'Malley? Sanders? Webb?
I didn't say I wouldn't leave, Eli.
Peter Florrick is running.
Running for what?
He's making a play for Vice President.
No.
Hillary will choose a senator.
No, a governor, an outsider.
Someone with a good story.
A man in prison, wrongfully convicted,
who comes back in triumph to become governor.
A man whose wife tried to steal an election.
A beloved wife who was misled by her handlers.
Weren't you one of those handlers?
Peter needs to come in a strong second in Iowa,
or the press will write us off.
I'm heading to the airport, Eli.
Let's talk tomorrow.
$25,000 a month, Ruth.
Five percent of the media budget, no cap.
A win bonus of two months salary.
You won't get better from Sanders.
Hello.
Could you hold, please?
Eli, I have to take this.
Just don't say "Yes."
Promise me you'll meet Peter first.
I'll meet Peter first. Can I go now?
Yes.
Mrs. Florrick, hello.
You're home early from court.
I asked Ms. Smulders to wait in the office for you.
Ms....?
Smulders. Your first client.
From the Web site?
Yeah.
Zach put it up last night. It looks really good.
Alicia Florrick, Attorney-at-Law.
Yes, she's busy, Your Honor.
Can she call you back?
Who is it?
No one. I'm calling myself.
Yes. Thank you.
Ms. Smulders.
Hello. I'm Alicia Florrick.
Yes, Mrs. Florrick,
I'm sorry that I didn't call ahead.
It's just I... I need a lawyer now, this afternoon.
Should I take notes, Mrs. Florrick?
No, thank you. I'm good.
I'll hold your calls.
Yes, please.
So, Ms. Smulders, why do you need a lawyer this afternoon?
My mother died.
I'm so sorry.
No. It was last week, but she didn't leave a will.
It shouldn't be contentious.
There's only two of us.
It's my brother and myself, and my mother
had put tack-on notes on everything to make sure
that there wouldn't be any disputes over who got what.
My mother doesn't have a lot of valuable things,
but she was a friend of Marc Chagall's wife, Valentina,
and she had given her a signed print.
A signed Chagall?
Do you know what it's worth?
$8 million.
I see. Um...
Who's your brother's lawyer?
Alicia. What a surprise.
David. Spreading your cheer far and wide, I see.
I thought you were working as a bond court pimp.
What are you doing here?
Multitasking.
I heard you lost your top four clients.
No. Three clients, and they weren't top.
Too bad this will be a clean dissolution of assets.
It'd be fun to get down in the muck together.
Oh, I have a feeling you'll find a way
to get down in the muck on this Chagall.
Oh, here's our executor now.
Hello, Mr. Dandy.
Handy.
Oh, I'm sorry. Here.
Let me help you with that, Mr. Handy.
As the executor, I'll photograph the placement
of Mrs. Smulders' tack-on notes on her valuables,
and if there is any disagreement,
I will be the final arbiter. Are we agreed?
This door has not been opened since Mrs. Smulders' death,
and this is the only key, so...
Here we go. It'll be my note or yours.
Great. They all fell off.
What is that?
A smoothie.
You don't drink smoothies.
I know. I'm changing, like a butterfly.
Good meeting?
Yeah.
Ruth Eastman gives us second place in Iowa.
Second place in Iowa gives us street cred.
And street cred gives us a hearing with Hillary.
And that is why I am drinking a smoothie.
Eli. Hi.
Hi.
You two are meeting already?
Yeah.
So, uh, let Eli and I talk, and then when we're done, Mm-hmm.
maybe you two can get together and have a conversation. Good?
Good. Uh, I want everything to be copacetic here.
I hate contention.
Why would there be contention, Peter?
Have a seat, have a seat.
No, i'm good. I'm good. Why-why-why contention?
Ruth has agreed to come on board.
And she has a campaign strategy
that is... very good.
Good. Good.
I think
I think she partially believes in me. But, more importantly,
she dislikes the Clintons.
How long has she been here?
Uh, about an hour.
I was just with her an hour ago.
You were the one on the phone offering her a job.
My job?
Eli, it's a national campaign,
and I need a national strategist.
Oh, my God, you're firing me.
No, I'm not. I'm not.
Whatever happened to loyalty?
This isn't about loyalty.
I got you here.
You wouldn't be here without me.
Oh, now, wait a minute...
No, no. When you were polling nothing,
when you were banging your ethics coordinator--
your freakin' ethics coordinator-- I stuck by you!
I cleaned up your mess.
Prostitutes, groupies, Alicia...
Don't go there.
I was the one freakin' set of footprints in the sand!
Eli, this is not about you.
This is about me trying to reach the middle class,
and I need her to do it!
Are you insane?!
Are you so narcissistic you can't see
you're stabbing me in the back?
I see a political operative who has a very inflated sense of his own worth.
Go to hell, Peter!
All right, you should go home.
I was gonna ask you to stay and be chief of staff
in the governor's office...
Uh, no.
But you know what I am gonna do?
I'm gonna find someone to run against you.
You just lost your greatest asset and made your worst enemy.
When does this partner meeting start, huh?
My back is killing me.
It's these chairs.
We need better lumbar support.
God, my butt. It's like sitting at a ball game.
Hey, a little quiet, please, huh?
Can't you see we're working here?
Everything good?
Yeah. Sorry about the noise, Mr. Agos.
Uh, you don't... you don't have to call me Mr. Agos.
You know, one thing I wanted to get going
was an associate social.
So maybe one night this week we can...
How you doing, kids?
Mr. Lyman, how's it going?
Oh, come on. None of that Mr. Lyman stuff.
Just call me Howie.
Howie, hmm?
How you doing?
I love that shirt.
We have a court time at 3:00 p.m. today, Alicia,
and I am not gonna get into a fight on this.
Don't lay it on so thick.
Let's agree to a 50% split on all assets,
including the Chagall.
Fine with me. See you then.
Sorry.
Hey, look who's back.
You were wrong.
Schakowsky freezes her out
one more time, she'll run off crying.
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
She doesn't look like she'll quit.
Right, like her S.A. run.
She stuck that one out. Never quit.
Good morning.
We had a very full lockup
here today, so let's all work together
and we'll get through this with some alacrity.
How many bar attorneys do I have today?
Four, Your Honor.
Ms. Quinn, you have 25 males.
Mr. Bukovitz, 18.
And, Mr. Weingarten, 20. Get up here.
It was a full moon last night. We had an influx of arrests.
So keep it moving.
What?
For the purposes of speed,
Your Honor, I would suggest giving five
of my sheets to Mrs. Florrick.
What?
Why would I do that?
I don't think I can carry this load
with the speed you require.
You've done it before.
Yeah, but I don't think I can today.
She slows me down,
it's your problem, Lucca.
I'm not joking.
Make sure she keeps up.
Mrs. Florrick,
come on up here, please.
Yes, Your Honor.
Six cases.
Don't slow me down, you hear me?
Thank you, Your Honor.
And if the meaning of "Alacrity" escapes anyone...
Thanks.
I didn't do anything.
389. Assault and battery.
Thank you, Mr. Banner.
Can you tell me about the charges, please?
Yeah. I didn't do it.
I didn't punch that bus driver.
What happened?
Well, I was just going to see my wife. She...
works at the hospital as a nurse.
Damn it, Matan!
And I go to see her for dinner. We just go down to the...
cafeteria on her break.
About the bus driver, sir?
Right, I'm getting to that.
My wife only gets 45 minutes for dinner,
and if I don't get there right at 8:00,
Alicia, can I talk to you for a second?
we don't get to have dinner...
You don't ask open-ended questions.
You ask yes or no questions and only about bail.
Yeah, but I need to know his story.
No, you don't.
In one minute, the judge is gonna call that client's name,
and you'll have to argue why he deserves bail.
If you're not ready, he goes to the back of the heap.
Josiah, uh, do you have a job?
Well, like, sometimes I work for my brother at his auto shop.
It's not...
And your family,
they depend on your job,
on the money your job brings in?
Well, you know, sometimes I...
Just a yes or no answer, please.
It's not a yes or no answer.
Come on, let's go.
Male 19, assault.
What do you have, ASA?
Assault and battery. With two BFWs for failure to appear.
Uh, he is a danger to the public and a flight risk.
Okay, got it. Uh, Mrs. Florrick,
mitigation?
Uh, yes, Your Honor. Mr. Banner's family--
his wife and his children... uh, his child--
depends on his salary at, um, an auto body shop that he works at.
And his other BFWs, well, they...
Give me just one second, your Honor...
Mr. Banner, your bail is set at $500,000.
What?
Excuse me, Your Honor, that's too much.
You need $50,000 to get out of jail.
I can't afford that.
Well, then you'll be held until trial.
August 5, Branch 44.
Next up, male 19,
drunk and disorderly.
Just move on to the next, now.
...obstructing traffic in Wicker Park.
The State requests $20,000 bail.
Damn it, Matan,
if you don't have the jacket on the DUI...
Uh, William R. Johnson.
DUI?
You okay?
I had six clients; four are still behind bars.
What do you think?
We're not in the miracle-working business.
It's an assembly line.
Keep the court moving-- that's all.
Here's the other thing. You didn't make any money today.
Yes, I did.
I had six cases. $135 a case.
No. None of them's gonna pay you.
You have to get 'em to check this box on their sheet.
It allows the county to send the $135 refunded bail straight to you.
That's how you get paid.
That's how you don't get cheated.
Otherwise, no one'll send you any money.
You catch on. It just takes a while.
Yeah.
Uh, damn it. I-I'm-I'm minutes away.
Oh, I see we have the small court today.
72 degrees, please, Sheriff. Thank you.
This is supposed to be a relatively easy probate.
What are we waiting on?
Not on us, Your Honor.
We're ready.
Me.
Your Honor, excuse me. I'm just coming from bond court.
We're ready, too. Due to the loss of tack-on notes,
Mrs. Smulders has agreed to a fifty-fifty division
of all assets.
Wise.
Good. Mr. Lee?
We would disagree that the notes are lost, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but given the fact
that a heat wave caused the notes to fall and are now
spread across the floor of Mrs. Smulders' house,
I would call that lost.
We would like to call a witness, Your Honor.
Dr. Ian Caine, adhesive expert
at Solvent and Curables Lab.
You're what?
An adhesive expert.
Really? That's a job?
Yes, it is, Your Honor.
Dr. Caine, did you have an opportunity
to examine the notes in Mrs. Smulders' house?
Yes, I did.
Pressure sensitive adhesives. Simple and imperfect.
And did you find anything relevant to this case?
Yes.
Every adhesive retains some trace of the surface
it comes in contact with.
We call that "Pressure sensitive contact release."
And did you do a chemical study
of the adhesive on this specific note?
Yes. It had traces
of Dutch Gold Leaf on its adhesive strip.
Your Honor, objection, we've had no access to this testing.
Well, give them access now.
There is a painting in Mrs. Smulders' house,
a Chagall original.
Did you happen to study
the chemicals on its gilded frame?
Yes, it's been painted with Dutch Gold Leaf.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Thank you. I'm sure you want some extra time
to go over that report, Mrs. Florrick.
Yes, Your Honor, but I do have a few questions.
Dr. Caine, I see that there are other chemicals
on this note's adhesive. What are they?
荷兰金箔残留成分
House dust mites.
Various lead compounds. Human hair.
From the carpet in the room?
Yes. Exactly.
It's to be expected.
I also see
that one of the desk lamps in Mrs. Smulders' house
is made of lead. You see that one here?
Yes.
Is it possible
that the lead on the adhesive
didn't come from the carpet
but came from the lamp?
Yes. It's possible.
But it still had gold leaf on it.
That means that the note came from the frame.
But if Mrs. Smulders changed her mind
and moved the note from the Chagall to the lamp,
Oh, come on!
would the note have both compounds on it?
Yes, it would.
Thank you.
I need an aerodynamics expert.
They're going after science.
Okay.
I'll ask Uncle Owen if he knows anyone.
And can you tell Eli I'll be ten minutes late for the interview?
Yes. Calling now.
I don't know why you're coming after me so hard.
Two name partners. Expert witnesses.
You think it's just happenstance
that you have a case across from us?
Mr. Governor, it's so good to see you.
Ted Willoughby.
You, too, Ted.
Me, too, Ted?
It's good to see you, too.
They warned me about your wit.
Ah, Mrs. Florrick. Hello, I'm Ruth Eastman.
Oh, hello. Sorry I'm late.
Um, I tried calling Eli,
but he didn't answer.
Oh, there-there's been a slight change.
We're going ahead with this interview,
but we're delaying the announcement till next week.
Why is that?
It's a smarter move.
Why is that the smarter move?
We can raise more funds if Peter isn't a candidate yet.
Now, I'll be getting you a chief of staff
to coordinate with the campaign.
I... Um, where's Eli?
Oh, he-he's no longer with the campaign.
I'm Ruth Eastman, the new campaign manager.
Don't worry.
Eli's very good, but I have a more national presence.
And I think you'll see we have a lot in common.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Peter, what the hell?
It's a national campaign, Alicia.
I need a campaign manager with a national strategy.
You need someone who cares.
Eli cared.
Caring is not enough.
He doesn't know the state.
He doesn't know the people.
He knows you.
He's loyal to you.
Alicia.
Right from the beginning,
you wanted nothing to do with this campaign.
You can't come in now and pretend that you have a voice.
This is my choice.
It's a hard choice. It's the hardest choice
I've ever had to make, but it's mine.
And I don't need you coming in now and scolding me.
My Gosh,
it's good to see you two smiling and laughing.
Mrs. Florrick,
if your husband does run,
why should voters vote for him?
Well, um, loyalty.
He's loyal to his family.
His friends.
He sticks with people.
I think Alicia's being very kind.
Obviously a candidate has to be loyal,
but he's got to be smart.
Balance is everything.
Yes, balance. And sticking to your word.
That's what voters want most in a candidate.
Well, I know that's what I want.
That and...
Can I have a beer with him?
Eli, it's me. It's Alicia.
Eli, you're not answering your phone.
We need to talk.
Eli, I can hear your movie.
Eli.
I heard. I'm sorry.
It's okay, I'm fine.
But thanks.
Eli, wait.
No, I just need to be done with it, Alicia.
I-I... I was never your friend.
I was just a political operative. I was the help.
And, uh... I need to be done. That's it.
No, no, no, we wait for Alicia to present her witness.
No, I... David, I disagree.
And then we use it as a rebuttal.
We don't wait for her to present her witness--
Don't you understand what I'm...
She's going to get ahead of the argument.
She's not gonna get ahead of the argument.
We don't let her take the offensive.
No.
Right now...
Okay, I don't think you understand
the way I'm thinking about this, obvious...
All right.
Explain it to me.
She will present her witness,
then we will use the...
Why are we letting her
present her witness first?
Right-right now, we are...
That's what I'm trying to explain to you.
Would you let me finish?
So, you guys happy at work?
Yeah.
Seriously,
if you have any complaints, I'm here, I'm listening.
Well, I pitched to the partners a new way to bill the clients.
But...
But what? They said no?
They wouldn't listen.
All the new firms are using it.
But the worry I have is, Lockhart/Agos
is seen as an older firm.
Not as friendly to new ideas.
Well, tell me what the idea is.
Dr. Douglas Dooley.
Aerodynamics expert from Chicago Polytech.
Were you able to investigate the fall pattern
of the notes below the Chagall painting?
She's got to be kidding.
Tack-on notes fall in a limited way
because they are denser than air.
They flutter,
but they will never flutter more than 30 degrees
from the starting point.
This is the falling cone.
So if we were to look at a photo
of Mrs. Smulders's residence,
we would be able to determine what notes could not
have fallen from the Chagall painting?
Yes, those falling out of this area.
That is the 30-degree cone of falling trajectory
from any spot on the painting.
Dr. Nigel Buggy.
I'm an industrial suction expert
with Ames Institute.
Okay, now you're just making these jobs up.
Dr. Buggy, did you read Dr. Dooley's testimony?
Wh... Uh, Dr. Dooley-- was he the tape guy?
No, fall pattern.
Yes, I did.
I mean, Dr. Dooley's opinion only holds
if the scene were undisturbed.
And what in your opinion disturbed the scene?
This.
I need you to find out everything you can about Roombas.
They're allowing Mrs. Smulders' Roomba into evidence.
Okay, I'm on their Web site now.
What might alter a programmable route for a Roomba?
Oh, that's my call waiting. I'll call you back.
Hello?
Alicia Florrick?
Yes, hello.
It's Lucca Quinn.
I need you to step in for me.
Um, I don't understand.
I have a deposition this afternoon.
I need someone to cover for me in bond court.
Bar attorneys stick together, Mrs. Florrick.
We cover for each other.
What time do you need me?
1:00 to 4:00.
You'll be the only attorney, so I'll need you there.
Okay, but I have to be in probate court at 4:30.
Shouldn't be a problem. Thanks.
Eli, this isn't healthy.
Snow Nazis?
Come on, make some calls.
It'll make you happy.
Good. W-Who can I call?
There you go.
Where are you going?
I highlighted the part that matters.
Thank you, Grace.
Can I stay and watch?
Definitely.
Thanks.
Eli. Hello.
Alicia.
You got a haircut.
It's sleek.
I wanted to apologize.
Obviously, I was very upset,
but I should never have said that to you.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
You never made me feel like the help.
And I always flattered myself to think I was...
almost a friend.
So my apologies.
Accepted.
That's why I want to be your chief of staff.
You're gonna need a chief of staff.
Someone to coordinate with the main campaign.
And it's better if you work with someone you know.
Eli, I don't think I'll have a choice in this.
I can make this work for you.
Whoever Ruth hires will make your life harder.
And it's not an easy job--
They're going to want to rehabilitate you.
Rehabilitate me?
From your failed campaign last year, from your scandal.
They need to make you a wife again.
Doctor,
you've shown us how the programmable Roomba
would have pushed a Clyde note
under the Chagall painting.
But isn't it true that this machine's programmed path
could be disrupted?
I don't... uh, understand.
Doesn't the instruction manual say
that a low battery causes a Roomba to stop what it's doing
and return back to the base station?
Oh, yes.
Sheriff, please.
Your Honor, we haven't been prepared for this.
Can you bring that Roomba back over here?
We need to get a better look at it.
Let's see if the battery level's low.
Okay, where do I look?
That gauge there...
Um, Your Honor?
Do you see something sticking out there?
Yes, another tack-on note.
Doctor, could you untangle that thing?
Selena.
Who's Selena?
Our housekeeper.
We need to get to the housekeeper.
But how do I do that?
Well, we need to hire an investigator. By the hour.
Damn it, I have to get to bond court.
But I thought that was tomorrow.
No, I told another attorney I'd help her out.
You know what, I'll ask for investigator references there...
Mrs. Florrick.
Can I drop you someplace?
I think we got off on the wrong foot, Alicia.
I actually have a very good bedside manner.
Well, Peter seems happy. That's what's important.
I want you to be happy, too.
We'll be needing to get you in front of a few key people.
To rehabilitate me?
Yes.
We hopefully won't eat up too much of your time,
but we need the voters to see the real you.
I'm not sure they'll like the real me.
That's why we need to mold a real you that they'll like.
I'll be hiring you a chief of staff.
Someone discreet.
Oh, I-I already have one.
You do? A chief of staff?
Yes.
Who?
Eli Gold.
No, unfortunately, um,
that won't work.
Why not?
Well, it's too soon.
Um, I want you to meet a few other options.
No, I'm good with Eli.
Mrs. Florrick, you're not paying for this. The campaign is.
Yes, and they're not paying for me.
I'm volunteering.
Are you suggesting you wouldn't be involved
in your husband's campaign?
Yes, actually, I am.
It was good to talk to you. This is where I get out.
If you want to find your own attorneys,
you'll have to wait till tonight after the bond hearing.
I don't get involved with the fees.
So you will make arrangements with your own
bar attorney.
Mrs. Florrick,
please approach.
Are you serious?
You're the only bar attorney here today?
Stepping in for Ms. Quinn, Your Honor.
You keep this moving, or you won't be in here again.
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Lancaster, I don't need to know whether you did it or not.
I just need to know about this previous arrest.
You'll see on your copy,
you need to check this box for your refunded bail money
to come to me.
Otherwise, I can't help you.
I'm sorry, sir, but we don't have much time.
Just nod if you can't get your words out.
Male 63.
Driving under the influence.
This was Mr. Baptiste's second DUI, Your Honor.
We would ask for substantial bail.
He is a 40-year-old who, um, did public service.
His record was expunged.
He was driving 85 miles in a 40-mile lane.
Bail granted. $1,500.
Male 64. Drug trafficking.
Second offense, Your Honor.
Two bond forfeiture warrants.
Mitigation?
Did you need any more time, Mrs. Florrick?
Oh, no, just, um, just a moment to find the page, Your Honor.
Your Honor, Mr. Wheeler isn't learning.
We ask for $750,000 in bail.
He is a single father of four.
The children have no one else.
He is a drug dealer who was unrepentant.
First of all, he didn't do it.
Selling crack
within 50 yards of a school.
Second of all, child services
will take his children away.
$100,000 bail, Mr. Wheeler.
Unless you can pay,
you will be held until trial.
Your Honor, we ask that you reconsider.
Male 65.
Probation violation. Mrs. Florrick, can I speak with you?
Don't you dare slow me down again.
You keep doing that, and I will tax your clients.
Now step back.
Octagon is a data visualization technique
that communicates eight key metrics
in an octagon-shaped digital and hard graphic.
As you can see from the handouts,
it's a way of finding graphical means to communicate
complex multivariable data
in a format that requires the end user
to have very little technical training.
Each end-user gets a new updated Octagon every month.
I don't get it.
Why can't we just do what we do?
Because this is a way to become more efficient.
The newer firms are using it.
I don't see the use, Cary.
We need to listen to new ideas.
And we did.
This firm is becoming a laughingstock.
Where?
We're seen as being old and out of touch.
The associates don't think we listen to them.
We need to change.
The only question, sir, is bail at this point.
I don't need...
Mrs. Florrick,
please approach.
You have to stay.
I don't have another bar attorney.
Step back.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I can't.
I have an inheritance matter in probate court.
I don't care. You're here.
You're staying.
Lucca, you need to get here now.
I need to get to probate in ten minutes.
Where's Don?
I don't know, but you need to get here now.
I'm too far away.
Where's probate court?
Who are you?
I'm Lucca Quinn.
Alicia asked me to step in just to get a continuance.
Where is she?
Okay, where are we?
Are we going to hear from a scissors expert today?
Your Honor, we actually have at our table
Mrs. Smulders' housekeeper, Selina Abarca.
They must have made a deal with her.
Your Honor, I'm Lucca Quinn.
I'm acting on behalf of Mrs. Florrick
to ask for a continuance.
Your Honor, this is a stalling tactic.
Uh, Mrs. Florrick is not stalling.
She's been held up at the bond court.
Really? She finds the bond court more important than us?
Not important, Your Honor. She's...
The judge is not allowing her...
What does this housekeeper have to say?
It's actually what our expert has to say
about her tack-on note.
Expert. You know, I thought we were gonna get by
at least ten minutes without an expert.
Your Honor, I must again ask for a continuance.
I am not privy to all of Mrs. Florrick's thinking on this.
Oh, that's too bad. Sit back down.
Do you know anything about this?
In examining this new pressure-sensitive adhesive,
I found more Dutch Gold Leaf.
The same imitation gold leaf from the Chagall frame?
荷兰金箔残留成分
That is correct.
And there was nothing else.
No lead from the lamp or the rug?
No.
Meaning Ms. Abarca's note
had to fall from the Chagall painting?
That's correct.
You should object.
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?
Good guess. No.
Your Honor,
we believe that the Chagall painting
was left to Mrs. Smulders' housekeeper, Selina Abarca,
and we ask that Your Honor rule.
Does Counselor have anything?
Again we ask for a continuance, Your Honor.
Ms. Lockhart has made a very strong argument.
I am prone to reward this housekeeper the inheritance
unless there's anything more.
Your Honor.
Counselor, I have already ruled.
There is not gonna be a continuance.
I understand.
I just wanted to be clear.
That lady is the housekeeper to the deceased?
Yes. Why?
And this is about an inheritance?
Yes, it is. You catch on quickly.
And was the deceased an invalid?
She was in a wheelchair. Why?
And I'm guessing this asset, this-this painting,
was worth more than $20,000.
Yes, it is. $8 million. Again, why?
The housekeeper can't inherit it.
Of course she can.
No.
According to Illinois law,
a caretaker to an invalid
cannot inherit more than $20,000.
Dismissed.
Okay, fifty-fifty. We'll be in touch.
Working late?
Almost done.
So... have some bad news.
The partners didn't really get Octagon.
Yeah, I didn't think they did.
I could see their faces.
But I don't want you to give up on pitching new things,
so just come to me, and I'll walk it in with you, okay?
Okay. Thanks.
If you ever need anything, just... I'm here.
Just talk to me.
I'm sorry. I thought...
No.
Uh, just the way you were talking...
No. No, I wasn't...
This was about opening up to the younger associates, that's all.
Okay. Sorry.
What are you doing, Eli?
What am I doing?
Packing.
Nice haircut.
Thanks.
No.
What are you doing with Mrs. Florrick?
She doesn't just get it into her head
to keep you on as chief of staff.
I'm pretty irresistible.
You're not getting that job, Eli.
I will make it a prerequisite of my employment.
I get to hire the wife's chief of staff.
Good. That sounds smart.
What do you know?
Ruth, you and I don't have time
to tell each other lies, so let's not.
I plan to use Alicia's rehabilitation campaign
to undercut you and eventually destroy you.
I may even destroy Peter in the process.
Not quite sure about that yet.
Well, thanks for your honesty.
What if I inform Peter?
I will, of course, deny it.
You will again tell him I'm out to hurt you.
He will think you're being paranoid and distracted
by something that has nothing to do with the campaign.
You planned it all out.
Not quite all but...
enough.
Talk to you soon.
Sooner than you think, Eli.
Thanks again.
Eh, all I did was vamp.
It was good vamping.
What do you want?
A beer.
So, how long have you been a lawyer?
I'm gonna go dance.
What?
There's a dance floor. I'm gonna go dance.
With who?
I don't know. I'll find someone.
Excuse me.
Hey, watch it.
Notice, I didn't say "Sorry."
"Excuse me" Is just about as bad.
Good job with the Smulder case.
Thanks. Are you following me?
No.
You just happen to be at this bar?
Okay, I followed you from court.
She is really good.
So, why'd you give me the case?
What makes you think I gave it to you?
I didn't at first.
I thought Madeline found my web site.
But then Diane suggested that you were using me as a pawn against them.
Why would she say that?
Because you're the devil.
All I was doing was sending you some work,
keep you from starving,
until you come to your senses and decide to join my firm.
You'll still be an independent. You'll still be your own woman.
You won't even work for me.
Unless you want me to stop sending you cases.
Do you want me to stop?
No.
