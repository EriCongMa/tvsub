for over a century , i have lived in secret until now .
i know the risk , but i have to know her .
elena , she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
is that &quot; damon salvatore &quot; ?
and that &apos;s &quot; stefan salvatore . &quot;
the original salvatore brothers .
1864 , you and katherine were the perfect couple .
they &apos;ve come back .
did you get the gilbert watch ?
i can get it .
hey , man . you ok ?
come here .
whoa . whoa . i got you .
i know you .
i think you have the wrong person .
you haven &apos;t aged a day .
there are things that you don &apos;t know ,
things that i want to tell you , but i can &apos;t .
are you sure that the man you knew ,
his name was stefan salvatore ?
yes .
when was this ?
1953 .
dear diary , i &apos;m not a believer .
people are born . they grow old .
then they die .
that &apos;s the world we live in .
how can i deny what &apos;s right in front of me ?
someone who never grows old ,
never gets hurt .
someone who changes in ways that can &apos;t be explained .
girls bitten .
somebody help !
bodies drained of blood .
mystic falls , virginia , 1864
you must be miss pierce .
please , call me katherine .
what are you ?
what are you ?
you know .
no , i don &apos;t .
yes , you do ,
or you wouldn &apos;t be here .
it &apos;s not possible .
it can &apos;t be .
everything you know ...
and every belief that you have is about to change .
are you ready for that ?
what are you ?
i &apos;m a vampire .
i shouldn &apos;t have come .
no .
please .
no . no .
how did you do that ?
please don &apos;t be afraid of me .
let me go .
elena , there &apos;s things that you have to know and understand .
let me go !
elena , please .
elena .
i would never hurt you .
you &apos;re safe with me .
all those animal attacks ,
those people who died--
no . that was damon .
damon ?
yes .
i don &apos;t drink human blood .
that &apos;s not how i choose to survive , but damon does .
i &apos;ll explain everything to you ,
but i beg you , elena ,
do not tell anybody .
how can you ask me that ?
because you knowing this is dangerous
for so many reasons .
you can hate me ,
but i need you to trust me .
just go .
just go , please .
go .
if you mean me no harm , then you &apos;ll go .
i never wanted this .
hello .
i want my ring .
where are you ?
i &apos;m at the sizzler .
i had the buffet .
where &apos;s my ring ?
i don &apos;t have it . where are you ? what have you done ?
no , what have you done ?
you &apos;re the one that locked me in the basement
so whatever i &apos;ve done ,
whoever i &apos;ve sucked dry is on you , buddy .
you &apos;re being careless . how many more
animal attacks is this town gonna believe , huh ?
i know how to cover my tracks , stefan .
where &apos;s my ring ?
i gave it to zach to hide .
probably shouldn &apos;t have killed him .
ah , you almost got me .
where is it ?
i &apos;ll get it back , but i need time .
what , did you fedex it to rome ? where is it ?
i want my ring , stefan ,
or my next stop &apos;s elena &apos;s .
i already want you dead .
don &apos;t give me another reason to make it happen .
don &apos;t give me another reason to rip you apart .
yeah ? is that gonna be before or
after you get your ring back .
just get it .
you just don &apos;t wanna die , do you ?
you said you would explain everything .
that &apos;s why i asked you to meet me here .
when you google &quot; vampire , &quot;
you get a world of fiction .
what &apos;s the reality ?
i can tell you whatever you wanna know .
i know you eat garlic .
yes .
and somehow , sunlight &apos;s not an issue .
here &apos;s your drinks .
thank you .
we have rings that protect us .
crucifixes ?
decorative .
holy water ?
drinkable .
mirrors ?
myth .
you said you don &apos;t kill to survive .
animal blood keeps me alive ,
but not as strong as damon . it can be very powerful .
and yet you let him get involved with caroline ?
forcing damon not to do something
is much more dangerous , believe me .
he was hurting her .
he was feeding on her . he was able
to take away her memories of being bitten
using a form of mind compulsion .
she never knew what was happening to her .
if he wanted to kill her , he would have .
is that supposed to make it ok ?
no . no , none of this is ok , elena .
i know that .
are there any others , aside from you and damon ?
not in mystic falls , not anymore .
not anymore ?
there was a time when this town was ...
very much aware of vampires ,
and it didn &apos;t end well for anybody .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important that you don &apos;tell anyone .
i can &apos;t promise that .
elena ...
give me today .
i will answer any questions that you have ,
and when it &apos;s over ,
you can decide for yourself
what you wanna do with what you know .
it &apos;ll be your choice .
never smelled one this bad before .
it tried to cover its tracks .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m positive . you only burn a corpse
to try to hide cause of death ,
and there are no shell casings .
we know who they are ?
doc &apos;ll have to check their dental records .
what story should i run ?
drug deal gone bad .
it &apos;s not too big a stretch .
i got the gilbert watch .
good .
found this in the brush about 10 yards away .
vicki donovan .
you know her ?
i went to high school with her mother .
think she &apos;s one of these ?
i hope not .
where are you , stefan ?
i &apos;m trapped at the house ,
and i &apos;m getting really bored and really impatient ,
and i don &apos;t do bored and impatient .
bring me my ring .
damn it .
aw , don &apos;t get blood on the couch .
please .
i got you good , didn &apos;t i ?
well , you &apos;re not gonna be any fun today .
i &apos;m so gonna regret this .
drink up .
drink it up .
don &apos;t drip .
there you go . good girl .
that &apos;s it .
stop here .
what are we doing here ?
i want to show you something .
in the middle of nowhere ?
this ...
didn &apos;t used to be nowhere .
used to be my home .
it looks so ...
old ?
it &apos;s because they are .
wait . how long have you ...
i &apos;ve been 17 years old since 1864 .
oh , my god .
you said you wanted to know .
i &apos;m not gonna hold anything back .
half century before the boardinghouse was even built ,
this was my family &apos;s home .
damon and i ...
we were both born here .
the salvatore brothers , best of friends .
wait. where did you learn this game ?
camp outside atlanta .
one of the officers picked it up at harvard. catch .
wait . what are the rules ? what are the rules ?
who needs rules ?
mind if i join you ?
uh , well , you could , uh-- you could get hurt .
my brother likes to play rough .
somehow , i think that you play rougher .
why are you just standing there ?
that is a girl who clearly wants to be chased .
if you don &apos;t do it , i will .
you knew katherine 1864 ?
damon made it seem like--
damon was trying to make you think that ...
i was still heartbroken .
he saw that i was happy with you ,
and he wanted to ruin it .
all because you loved the same women 145 years ago ?
she wasn &apos;t just any girl .
i win. what &apos;s my prize ?
what would you like it to be ?
they extended your leave ?
i was simply having too much fun to return to battle .
your commitment to the confederacy is inspiring .
well , this works out wonderfully for me .
how &apos;s that , miss katherine ?
now i &apos;ll have both of you here to keep me entertained .
first and foremost ,
i &apos;ll need someone to escort me to the founder &apos;s ball .
with pleasure .
i would be honored .
the smart and kind salvatore
brothers both coming to my escort .
how will i ever choose ?
she chose me .
i escorted her to the ball
at the original lockwood mansion .
the first founder &apos;s party ...
where you signed the registry .
i didn &apos;t care that i had gotten
something that my brother wanted
i didn &apos;t even care if it hurt him .
i only knew that i wanted her .
so he was upset .
that &apos;s the thing about damon .
he doesn &apos;t get mad .
he just gets even .
oh , man .
that shower was so great .
what did you give me ?
some blood. you loved it .
i did ?
wait . i &apos;m confused .
how did we get here ?
we met in the woods .
you were drunk . i attacked you .
then i killed all of your friends and brought you here ,
gave you some blood . you loved it .
and now we &apos;re gonna party till the sun goes down .
ok .
um , but first , can i have another hit ?
that blood was so good .
only if i can .
what damon wants , damon usually gets .
i didn &apos;t know it at that time , but ...
turns out that night ...
katherine was with him , too .
so he stole her from you ,
not the other way around ?
turns out she wasn &apos;t ours to steal .
i will love you forever .
forever is a very long time , you know .
not long enough .
good morning .
leave the room , please .
you &apos;re upset .
your face ,
it was like a demon .
but you &apos;re not afraid .
get away from me. get away .
it doesn &apos;t change the way you feel about me .
you will not tell anyone .
i ...
we will go on exactly as we have .
yes .
we will go on .
you have no idea of the future i have planned for us ,
stefan
you , me , and damon .
no rules .
she could control my mind and damon &apos;s .
she compelled each of us to keep the secret from the other .
she wanted all of us to be together forever .
didn &apos;t work out that way , but ...
damon and i , looks like we &apos;re stuck with each other ...
like it or not .
is that damon &apos;s ring ?
i took it from him , but i have to give it back .
no. don &apos;t , stefan . keep it hidden .
elena , if i don &apos;t give it to him ,
he &apos;ll retaliate in the only way that he knows he can hurt me .
and how is that ?
by hurting you .
we are working on the mayor lockwood
doc id the bodies ?
a few townies . notorious druggies .
i suppose that &apos;ll make it easy for people to buy the story .
and vicki donovan ?
she &apos;s not one of the deceased .
where the hell is she ?
i wish i knew .
sorry i &apos;m late .
you have the watch ?
it &apos;s ready .
that &apos;s it ?
yes. that &apos;s it .
i am so over tyler , so over him .
i knew from the beginning
that i was only a piece of ass to him ,
but i thought maybe if he got to know me better ,
he might he might see something more .
but no .
now , jeremy , on the other hand ,
that &apos;s all he &apos;s ever seen in me is something more ,
and i like that .
jeremy , huh ?
elena &apos;s brother ?
yeah . yeah .
so , elena used to date my brother ,
and they were always together ,
so jeremy would always be hanging around
and crushing on me and--
hey , why don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ?
you &apos;re , like , totally cool and so hot .
i know .
don &apos;t you wanna be in love ?
i &apos;ve been in love .
it &apos;s painful and pointless and overrated .
except when it isn &apos;t .
no more talking .
let &apos;s dance .
my mom spends most of her time
in virginia beach with pete .
he drives trucks .
i don &apos;t remember my dad , but from what i gather ,
he &apos;s not worth remembering .
your life is so pathetic .
yeah . i mean , i &apos;m the screwed @-@ up one .
matt &apos;s got it so easy .
he &apos;s the golden boy .
i mean , he &apos;s gonna get a football scholarship
and marry elena
and have a lawn mower and some babies ,
and when i think of my future , i just come up blank .
you are so damaged .
yep .
i mean , you don &apos;t have one hint of self @-@ esteem .
nope , none .
i think i know what can help you .
so what &apos;s that ?
death .
what happened ?
we were dancing , and then--
then i killed you .
what ?
you &apos;re dead .
i &apos;m dead ?
yeah , well , let &apos;s not make a big deal out of it .
drank my blood , i killed you ,
and now you have to feed in order to complete the process .
you &apos;re wasted .
you don &apos;t wanna be out there all alone .
you &apos;re about to get really freaky .
ok , i had a really good time .
i just wanna go home .
you &apos;re gonna start craving blood ,
and until you get it , you &apos;re gonna feel very out of it .
you have to be careful .
come on , move .
see ? you &apos;re already starting to fall apart .
and i &apos;m going home now .
ok , fine . i &apos;m just warning you .
actually , you know what ?
you should go .
in fact , if i were you ,
i would stop by your boyfriend jeremy &apos;s house .
yeah , whatever .
bye .
tell elena i said hi .
and if you see stefan , tell him to call me .
i got stanley on the moore street entrance .
the rest of us &apos;ll cover other access points .
call him or call me if that thing goes off .
don &apos;t use the radio . cellphones only .
got it .
you &apos;ve got 8 rounds .
remember , wood bullets won &apos;t kill him ,
but it &apos;ll wound him enough
for you to get close and stake him .
you sure you can handle this ?
of course i can .
you ever staked a vampire before ?
have you ?
coming !
the sun is killing me . my eyes are on fire .
where have you been ?
it &apos;s good . everything &apos;s good .
did something happen ?
i &apos;m hungry .
what do you got to eat ?
you &apos;re high ?
vicki , it &apos;s the middle of the day .
could you just not talk so loud ?
my head , it hurts .
i need quiet .
the mind control ...
you said katherine used .
do you ever do that to me ?
no .
that necklace ,
it contains an herb called vervain .
it protects you from being compelled .
i wanted to protect you from damon &apos;s influence .
but i also wanted to ...
protect you from me .
elena , you should never take that necklace off ...
because no matter what happens after today ,
no matter how you feel about me ...
you &apos;ll know that you were free to make your own choice .
where is she ?
come this way .
what &apos;s she on ?
i don &apos;t know .
hey , vic . how you doin &apos; ?
not good , mattie .
i hurt .
ok , where &apos;s it hurt ?
my gums . my jaw hurts .
my gum--there &apos;s something in my gums , and it hurts .
ok , well--
no. just leave me alone .
come on , vic . don &apos;t be like that .
let &apos;s get you home .
just turn it off !
turn what off ?
the talking , the chatter ,
just turn it off .
3 bodies were found dead in what is believed to be
a drug deal gone awry .
the bodies have yet to be identified .
they were discovered earlier today
over at the old mystic falls cemetery .
that &apos;s where we were last night .
what happened , vic ?
... homicide , and are fast under way looking for suspects .
they &apos;re asking anyone with information ...
i &apos;m calling the cops .
no . don &apos;t .
what happened after i left last night , vick ?
jer , you okay ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
damn , vick .
what &apos;s going on ?
she &apos;s really messed up .
elena , back up .
vicki , look at me .
focus .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
guys , take her up to bed . shut the blinds .
she &apos;s gonna be ok . come on .
come on .
you know what &apos;s wrong with her ?
yep .
what is it ?
she &apos;s transitioning .
transitioning to what ?
a vampire .
what ?
damon must have gotten to her . she &apos;s new .
she hasn &apos;t completed her transformation yet .
h @-@ how does she do that ?
she has to feed on human blood .
and what if she doesn &apos;t ?
she &apos;ll die .
she may only have a few hours .
she &apos;s upstairs with him right now .
it &apos;s ok . she doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s happening to her yet .
so when is she gonna know ?
right now , she doesn &apos;t remember anything .
a part of her is still human ,
but slowly , the deeper she gets into the transition ,
the memories will start to come back ,
and then she &apos;ll know she has to make the choice .
the same choice you made ?
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m so much trouble .
aw , you just--you need to sleep it off , ok ?
no .
vick .
vick !
she was fine , and then she just-- she just freaked out .
i &apos;m gonna go look for her .
call me if you hear anything .
i can track her .
go .
yeah .
i think i got something .
it &apos;s pointing towards the old cemetery .
headed your way .
maybe we should check in with matt .
he &apos;ll call when he finds her .
well , what are we supposed to do ?
we wait. we &apos;re supposed to wait .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with her .
she &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;ll all be fine .
jeremy , go upstairs .
you &apos;re afraid of me .
i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb here and guess .
stefan finally fessed up .
stay away from me .
hey , there &apos;s no need to be rude .
i &apos;m just looking for stefan .
may i come in ?
oh , wait. of course i can .
i &apos;ve been invited .
we can cut to the chase if you want .
i &apos;m not gonna kill you right now .
that wouldn &apos;t serve my greater agenda .
so ...
where &apos;s stefan ?
he &apos;s out looking for vicki .
don &apos;t look at me with those judgey little eyes .
girl &apos;s gonna thank me for what i did to her .
did you thank katherine ?
got the whole life story , huh ?
i got enough .
oh , i doubt that .
tell my brother i &apos;m looking for him .
oh , tip for later .
be careful who you invite in the house .
vicki .
i &apos;m starting to remember things--
what he is , what he said .
i remember you . the hospital ,
the--the rooftop , it &apos;s all coming back .
i &apos;m so sorry .
damon had no right to do this to you .
he said that i need to feed .
what will happen if i don &apos;t ?
you &apos;ll fade quickly ...
and then it &apos;ll all just be over .
i &apos;ll be dead .
i don &apos;t want this .
i know . it &apos;ll be ok .
you &apos;re gonnae ok .
i can help you .
is it better ?
is it better ?
will i be better ?
i wanna go home .
will you take me home ?
ok .
no !
it &apos;s wood .
they know .
if anyone &apos;s gonna kill you , it &apos;s gonna be me .
my ring .
no !
no ! vicki !
i &apos;m sorry .
the watch .
find the watch .
you &apos;re bleeding .
no , it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m ok .
i couldn &apos;t stop her .
i tried .
what does that mean ?
she fed ,
and then i lost her .
oh , my god .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
i &apos;ll find her , and i will show her
that she can live like i do .
i will make sure that she does
not hurt anybody , elena . i promise you .
what do i tell my brother and-- and matt ?
we &apos;ll come up with a story .
you mean we &apos;ll come up with a lie .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i gave you today just like you asked .
and i understand that you would
never do anything to hurt me .
and i promise i will keep your secret , but ...
i can &apos;t be with you , stefan .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
