why did frankie call us here ?
i don &apos;t know ,
some financial prospect that could put the school in the black .
which always confuses me ,
because black means bad , when it &apos;s a cat or a banana ,
or a shirt that makes you think you &apos;ve lost more weight than you have .
nice save . sorry about that , man .
what ?
did someone use the word black and
now you want me to give you the all clear ?
please tell me that won &apos;t be my role in this group .
i have a brain the size of jupiter .
i &apos;m nobody &apos;s forth ghost buster .
no , i promise , this group does not think that way .
in fact , before you got here , they had two .
no .
they had to often step back and
remind themselves that they weren &apos;t one collective ray of light .
is this a cult ?
are you gonna eat me ?
no , we &apos;re fine .
i lived in new york .
speaking of which , midterms are over and
i was thinking we could have a party at our apartment .
abed , annie ?
you can have a party .
you can &apos;t have a rager .
we have a rule against more than eight guests .
eight guests ?
that &apos;s not , not a rager , that &apos;s not a party .
nice grammar .
okay , you have a rule against parties ,
which i &apos;m sure is a world record for uptightness ,
so let &apos;s celebrate that .
i &apos;ll bring the booze and more than eight guests .
britta you just moved in ,
you don &apos;t even have a real bedroom .
you &apos;re a coucher .
she sleeps on the couch .
she &apos;s a coucher .
so i get nothing ?
you get a couch .
you get a home .
there &apos;s no government to overthrow here .
i &apos;m not overthrowing .
you &apos;re overthrowing it by say @-@ so .
nice irony .
can we focus on this , because now this is happening .
hello , everyone .
don &apos;t be alarmed .
i &apos;m attending our meeting using what &apos;s called a telepresence robot .
i resent the idea that this would alarm me .
these bots have been revolutionizing the private sector ,
and now the state of colorado has come to us with a unique .
proposition .
seamless , frankie .
the department of corrections will pay us money
if we allow a small manageable
number of inmates to attend greendale using these .
now , hold on , are you trying to tell me that prisoners
would use these things to come to our school ?
that &apos;s the black guy in every sci @-@ fi movie .
i &apos;ll allow it .
wait , prisoners , rolling around the school with students ?
they &apos;ll rape us .
they &apos;ll rape us all .
they can &apos;t rape you because
their genitals will be hundreds of miles away .
from each other ?
this is an attempt at rehabilitation .
the prison is looking for ways to expose their
inmates to a real world academic environment .
okay , i &apos;ve heard enough .
i &apos;m responsible for this school .
i won &apos;t have hardened criminals exposing themselves to it .
that &apos;s the response they &apos;re getting from everyone ,
which is why the state is offering a $ 300,000 incentive .
we &apos;ll do it .
dean , do it .
300,000 for the school .
they &apos;re convicts .
they &apos;re ipads on sticks .
as someone that got paid to keep people out , let me tell you .
hey , guys ?
i &apos;m moonwalking .
not every bad guy ends up in prison ,
and not every prisoner is a bad guy .
who &apos;s this guy ?
300,000 !
oh , yeah .
jeffrey , you know ordinarily i do anything you say .
do it .
let &apos;s do it .
oh , i walked into that one .
gross , who farted ? oh , wait , nevermind .
第六季 第五集
i &apos;m so glad you talked me into this ,
$ 300.000 , look at us ,
running the school together .
no , if i &apos;m running the school , pay me more .
oh , what if i made you professor emeritus ?
we could have a little ceremony .
does it pay more ?
no .
then give me what the ceremony would cost .
okay , folks welcome .
i , i believe you all have maps of our campus .
and this is your dean .
dean ?
now , if i see any race gangs forming ,
i will have no choice but to adjust
the contrast on your screens until you all look the same .
and , we have a very strict no bullying policy
that relates directly to me .
so be nice to me .
no need to be nervous .
we &apos;re all here because we done some bad stuff ,
but we ain &apos;t here do anymore .
aw , that &apos;s very folksy . thank you .
so , i guess just .
roll forth and rehabilitate !
they can see us and we can see them so .
welcome .
all right , knock it off .
no one at this school , should pick on any class of people .
it &apos;s like watching magicians bully jugglers .
what &apos;s your name ?
willie .
willie . take a seat .
i &apos;m mr. jeff winger , i teach fundamentals of law .
does that mean you can teach me how to get out ?
probably not .
i was a phony lawyer , i got caught ,
and now i teach a pretty phony class .
it &apos;s an automatic a , but you might learn a thing or two .
and i mean literally a thing or two , cool ?
and the call me the criminal .
trust me , i know the main difference between us ,
is an orange jumpsuit .
you have an ipad .
yeah , and i &apos;m a murderer .
now now , don &apos;t worry , i ain &apos;t proud of it .
just don &apos;t hide it .
you know , once you take another man &apos;s life ,
the least you can do is carry it with you .
are you carrying any murders , mr. winger ?
i am not .
i hear you have to have strong feelings for someone you kill .
i try to reserve that stuff for myself .
all right . that &apos;s enough law .
who wants to watch planet earth ?
oh , look .
ice world .
oh , the majesty ,
rhinos and elephants .
hey , abed .
haven &apos;t you been in our apartment longer than annie ?
oh yeah . i remember when she first moved in .
that &apos;s back when i was so worried about pacing ,
i was constantly laying groundwork for pop back gag &apos;s .
hey annie , i &apos;d like to make this moment worth popping back
to from some point in the future .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
there , don &apos;t worry , it &apos;ll pay off .
hey troy .
i &apos;m glad i kicked that habit ,
it was getting a little joyless .
what i &apos;m saying is , by annie &apos;s logic .
you &apos;re saying i was first in the apartment ,
so i could overrule annie and let you have a party ,
but i don &apos;t get anything out of parties .
they &apos;re like conventions for every subject ,
too boring to have their own convention ,
and instead of joss whedon , the police show up .
the police also showed up
when you made leonard take off his clothes
and filled the living room with lizards .
that was from my movie , reverse godzilla .
i also thought i might make a good pop back .
i make movies , britta .
i make movies , annie makes rules ,
you make parties , her rules cancel out your parties ,
but i &apos;m not involved , i just make movies .
hey there .
evening , mr. winger .
willy , you &apos;re here late .
yeah , taking some night classes .
trying to take full advantage , you know ?
is this your car ?
it &apos;s nice .
looks like you &apos;re taking full advantage too .
yeah . it &apos;s a real dream gig .
mm , sarcasm , slick words , cock of the walk .
what are categories in prison jeopardy ?
hey , you mind helping me out with something ?
i think i lost a ball bearing .
it rolled down them stairs .
lost a ball bearing ?
mm @-@ hm , down them stairs .
you want me to look down these stairs ?
okay .
did you just try to murder me ?
are you trying to murder me ?
you &apos;re trying as hard as you can right now to kill me .
okay well ...
i guess i &apos;ll see you in class tomorrow ,
guy who tried to murder me .
oh i &apos;ll see you in class tomorrow , mr. winger .
i will see you , yeah i &apos;ll see you .
oh , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow , mr. winger .
so we are having a party ?
annie , you know me better than that ,
this is all set dressing ,
i &apos;m helping abed produce his next film .
britta &apos;s party ,
based on a true story of fun and no rules .
fade in before a party .
people start coming over , way more than eight .
it becomes a rager , everyone has a great time
and parties like there &apos;s no tomorrow , then they leave .
sophia cleans up , the end .
we &apos;re very interested in you for the role of sophia .
i see the real time stakes of can &apos;t hardly wait ,
the subversive raunch of risky business ,
and the mumbly pointlessness of everything after 2003 .
yeah , but real .
totally real .
the first movie to capture the heart of a real party .
the sensation that there &apos;s no tomorrow ,
the transcendence of time and mortality .
bravo britta , very clever .
me ?
don &apos;t look at me , i could never greenlight a project this big ,
i moved in third , i am a coucher .
she &apos;s a coucher .
i sleep on a couch !
i sleep on a couch !
oh , she &apos;s a coucher !
i &apos;m a coucher !
who was it ?
it &apos;s a coucher ! oh , boy .
okay , good night .
good night .
before this is over , you &apos;ll beg for my forgiveness .
so , we have an ultimately low stakes ,
but nonetheless creepy problem with one of our y felons .
you mean willie ?
yes .
what else did he do ?
did he steal a driver &apos;s ed simulator ?
did he start an illegal game of solitaire on his face ?
jeffrey , he &apos;s in the room .
hey , mr. winger .
why is he on your laptop ?
he came to me for a chat this morning .
he &apos;s here for an education , jeffrey ,
and he reports to the prison .
could you do a little more in your class than show planet earth ?
you &apos;re telling on me ?
he tried to murder me last night .
what ?
now hold on .
now where i &apos;m from ,
if you accuse somebody of something , you better have evidence
or he better be a minority .
he tried to push me down the stairs .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
it was ridiculous ,
but this is not someone who should be interacting with students .
and you &apos;re seriously taking his word over mine .
well , have you ever killed anyone jeffrey ?
why would an actual murderer
want to kill a community college teacher .
now i &apos;m not worth murdering .
why would i lie ?
isn &apos;t that your specialty ?
your rocking tour .
you charm people with your slick and fancy words .
willy , willy just charms them .
oh my god .
i should leave you two alone . i &apos;ve got class ,
some of us came here to work .
jealousy isn &apos;t a crime , jeffrey ,
but costing the school $ 300 , 000 will be .
so be a good teacher , especially when willy &apos;s watching .
which is why , they call it yard juice .
next question .
do you get to pick your number ?
does anyone ever get their head stuck between the bars ?
we call it getting metal ears .
oh , hi , mr. winger !
thought we &apos;d sneak in a little learning for the movie .
well , there &apos;s no movie today .
so everyone roll to your seat areas .
yes sir .
so , law .
law is , simply put ,
an agreement we all make
to do our best to stay out of each others way .
is there a more technical definition , mr. winger ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t know , willy .
i don &apos;t cotton much to fancy words and book study .
it &apos;s not how i got to where i am .
how did you get to be where you are , mr. winger ?
where were you born ?
mr. winger was born in dirt , willy .
same as you , i &apos;m sure .
and i had my face held down in that dirt by the kings of dirt .
and now , they &apos;re still there , ruling over dirt ,
and i got out .
by talking , by lying .
well , in case you hadn &apos;t noticed , it seems to beat being a bully .
garrett ?
mr. winger when did you stop being funny ?
i mean , am i wrong ?
or is he really intense here ?
everyone &apos;s so charmed by him because he &apos;s a violent criminal .
but he &apos;s also a petty sociopath ,
and the more i try to point that out , the pettier i look .
you the one who championed this program
shouldn &apos;t have worn that petard
if you didn &apos;t wanna be hoisted by it .
what do you think the expression
hoisted by your own petard is referencing ?
i guess i just assumed that
in the old days a patard was a special outfit
like a leatard , with a lot of fancy buckles and loops on it ,
and that rich people would wear them
when they were feeling especially smug .
but then poor people could tie a rope to one of the loops ,
and hoist them up a pole
and then let them dangle there as punishment for being cocky .
never look it up ,
your explanation is way better ,
but also the next time a friend comes by with their problems ,
maybe lay off the i told you sos .
jeff , we &apos;re having a britta party here ,
could you be a little bit less of a buzz kill ?
that was great .
now party like there &apos;s no tomorrow .
what ?
there &apos;s no tomorrow .
party like it .
okay .
why don &apos;t you just do some business in the background for now ?
hi , everybody .
don &apos;t worry we &apos;re not here to bust up your party ,
i know most of you are like 30 .
we &apos;re here because frankie dart has exciting news .
you have all been very cooperative
with this inmate education program .
the department of corrections is very , very happy .
which means , greendale is gonna be rich .
don &apos;t tell anybody ,
but we smuggled in a few guests
to the party to celebrate with us .
did someone order a prison break ?
plenty of convicts to go around .
hey , okay !
hold on , hold on , hold on !
take him to the dance floor .
cheers .
pass him around .
pass , that &apos;s willy , pass him , yeah !
pass willy , pass me willy .
you go willy .
keep doing that .
keep doing that .
try dancing harder .
is that as hard as you can dance ?
you &apos;re at a party . you &apos;re celebrating .
abed , it &apos;s six in the morning .
okay . thanks .
do you think you &apos;ve gotten enough shots ?
nobody &apos;s partied like there &apos;s no tomorrow yet .
they keep dancing like it &apos;s today .
that &apos;s okay .
are you joking ?
this is the reason i signed on to this film ,
i think it &apos;s a performance issue .
i think this needed some real actors .
well , lesson learned .
yeah .
okay . from the top !
and action !
what ?
who are these people ?
go , go , go !
good , dean .
good , francine .
party .
party , no tomorrow guys , come on .
hey mr. winger , you know i was thinking for class today ,
maybe you could ... hey , what &apos;s going on ?
hey , careful now , put me down !
well , willy .
look at me !
i &apos;m a murderer !
can i be as cool as you now ?
willy ?
no , no , no , no , no , no .
willy , talk to me !
talk to me !
i can &apos;t see anything .
willy . willy .
focus on my voice .
hey i , i , i &apos;m losing you .
you &apos;re not losing me !
you are going to a better place with a stronger signal !
willy ?
willy ?
willy ?
what &apos;s going on here ?
he started it .
jeffrey .
you are on sabbatical .
you can &apos;t do that .
yes , i can .
two weeks paid sabbatical !
get him out of here .
he &apos;s banned from the campus .
you are on sabbatical !
you &apos;re on sabbatical , sir .
yeah , i &apos;ll go on my own with dignity .
something you should look up .
i can &apos;t look it up , you destroyed my device !
and my heart !
you destroyed his device and his heart , sir .
yeah , i &apos;m going .
willy , willy .
oh , sorry i &apos;m late , i had to find a parking spot for my house .
oh , must be so cool living in a vehicle .
wait , where &apos;s your poop go ?
a tank .
gross .
get a house .
ben , aren &apos;t you homeless ?
yeah , but i poop in a house .
whose ?
nice try .
annie .
britta .
how &apos;s your movie coming ?
amazing .
abed &apos;s a genius .
he &apos;s actually having a hard time deciding what to cut ,
so it &apos;s going to be in two volumes .
and it &apos;s hard to sleep , but it &apos;s worth it ,
because it &apos;s a movie about a party .
would you like my help ?
yes .
have you learned anything ?
don &apos;t question rules . rules are good ,
i &apos;m bad , all hail annie .
thank you .
damn .
oh , nice of you to show up .
we moved here for you .
i didn &apos;t ask for this ,
have your meeting at school without me . i don &apos;t care .
dean &apos;s using the study room for the ceremony .
wha , the , ceremony ?
you don &apos;t know ?
the dean &apos;s making that convict he murdered into a professor .
what ?
why do you care ?
because the dean is just doing this to prove something ,
and it &apos;s really stupid .
the guy &apos;s dangerous and he &apos;s manipulating him .
isn &apos;t that what you usually do ?
no , i mean , yes , but not like that .
i lied to the dean for personal gain .
i wouldn &apos;t use him emotionally .
i wouldn &apos;t mislead him .
i wouldn &apos;t hurt him .
have you ever thought of saying that to the dean ?
jeff , go to him .
going to him .
wait , that &apos;s the whole point .
i can &apos;t go to him , i can &apos;t get on campus .
and yet murderers can .
what have i done ?
murderers can get on campus .
i &apos;ll need a broom , a remote control car ,
an ipad , and an elaborate
gyroscopically stabilized servo motor .
dude , we &apos;re trying to help jeff here ,
you &apos;re acting kinda spoiled right now .
party , party , party , party , party , party , party , party ,
party , party , party , party , party , party , party ,
party , party , party , party , party , party , party .
cut !
abed , britta has something to say .
my script is misleading .
it &apos;s impossible to party like there &apos;s no tomorrow .
but it &apos;s based on a true .
it &apos;s based on my desire to have a party .
parties are just booze ,
low lights and loud music
so people can feel more , see less ,
and not have to listen to each other or themselves .
that &apos;s stupid .
parties are stupid .
i &apos;m stupid , you &apos;re shooting a stupid movie .
that &apos;s a wrap .
go on , we &apos;re done here .
what &apos;s gonna happen to me ?
you are going to punished ,
in ways you won &apos;t understand
for longer than you think is rational or possible .
but then one day ,
you &apos;ll do something he likes , and he &apos;ll stop .
and eventually you &apos;ll either adapt or lose your mind .
okay .
girls .
girls .
as a prison warden i know all too well
how rare stories of true rehabilitation can be ,
but this dean and this prisoner stand here together today
to prove that the dream is real .
i &apos;m here for the ceremony .
last name ?
gellar , prisoner id 042098 .
okay , go on .
hi , i &apos;m here for the ceremony .
have a nice night , sir .
dean craig pelton .
do you accept responsibility
for any damage incurred by hiring a felon ?
i do .
willy seibert smith ,
do you accept that the 13th amendment abolished slavery
for everyone but convicts ,
and that we have no choice but to pay you $ 0.13 per hour or less ?
i do .
then let us make official this symbolic union .
hold it !
dean , i agree there &apos;s no reason
you shouldn &apos;t give this guy my job .
save it jeffrey , i don &apos;t wanna hear it .
don &apos;t do it before i tell you some things
that i &apos;ve been getting away with not saying .
someone get this maniac out of here .
quite willy .
let &apos;s do this by prison rules .
say what you have to say .
dean , i like my job ,
i don &apos;t mind coming to work here .
i feel kind of guilty when i pretend to be sick ,
and i try to steal as little as possible ,
just the basics , pens , coffee filters , toilet paper ,
and one time an overhead projector and a roll of carpet .
but i don &apos;t lead you on , and i never will .
because i &apos;m not just a pretty face that murders people
and tells you what you wanna hear .
i &apos;m less than that .
i &apos;m a gorgeous face , that works for you ,
and considers you a friend .
oh , jeffrey .
okay , that , now , to be fair .
you guys know will is an innocent man , right ?
you shut your mouth , warden .
no , it &apos;s true .
his appeal is in motion , there &apos;s new dna evidence ,
he &apos;s a good fella , wrongfully convicted .
you &apos;re not a murderer ?
i can explain .
oh , how the mighty have fallen .
son of a bitch !
what ?
wait , let &apos;s do this by community college rules .
fight ! fight ! fight !
fight ! fight ! fight !
go , broom .
go !
bring it on !
it &apos;s so violent .
party like a girl .
is this what you got ?
here &apos;s what i got .
come on , let &apos;s do it !
jeffrey !
he &apos;s down .
now , who &apos;s fallen ?
hey , willy .
thanks , dean .
dean .
dean .
oh come on .
no , no .
no , no .
way to go mr. winger !
way to go !
everybody , i am not participating in this .
the hell kinda school is this ?
okay , thanks for coming on short notice .
is everyone here ?
think so , it &apos;s hard to tell without side cameras .
wait , why am i moving ?
is my custom background working ?
wait , i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s wasd the move , it &apos;s been the same
since the invention of the keyboard .
okay , nerd .
as you &apos;ve heard , the rehabilitation program has been aborted ,
so we lost that money ,
but we no longer have to build 67 ramps ,
so we should break @-@ even .
can you all hear that ?
there &apos;s a kid outside throwing tennis balls against my rv .
i think i coffee shop corporate thieves .
was it really necessary for us to use these things for this meeting ?
yeah , i think there &apos;s something wrong with mine .
i &apos;ll get a better connection .
it wasn &apos;t entirely necessary ,
but the prison is selling these units at a discount ,
so i thought i &apos;d run their offer by the school .
what are you doing ?
get out ! mine &apos;s broken .
no , it &apos;s not .
bad connect .
there &apos;s a janitor on it right now .
terrib ... call others ...
i think britta &apos;s being arrested .
i have every right to be here .
you think , scared of you , but not .
all right . that &apos;s it .
do you know how much windows cost ?
get off my lap !
stop fighting technology .
i vote yes .
we should get these . they &apos;re cool .
i vote no .
people shouldn &apos;t have to be everywhere at once .
sometimes , we need to do our own thing .
chang , where are you ?
i &apos;m doing my own thing .
why is there tile behind you ?
please tell me you &apos;re not doing the thing , i think you &apos;re doing .
yeah .
that &apos;s the same towel we have in our apartment &apos;s bathroom .
what ? chang ?
i gotta go .
oh my god .
yeah , i gotta go , too .
jeffrey .
i take it we &apos;re passing on their offer .
no . their just amateurs .
initiating override protocol .
all in favor of this purchase .
affirmative .
very well .
abedit &apos;s , commence with world domination .
eradicate .
eradicate .
eradicate . eradicate . eradicate .
did you get any of that ?
