what are you doing in my house ? who are you ?
i &apos;m marco reyes .
when your brother disappeared ,
he was in possession of a significant amount my money .
okay . how much money ?
18 @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half million dollars .
you have until monday to bring my money to this address .
what happens if i don &apos;t bring you the money ?
you &apos;ll get a package with your brother &apos;s head in it .
three years ago , matt gets on that plane .
not a single piece of luggage ,
but he &apos;s supposed to have 18 @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half million dollars .
if that &apos;s the case , then it &apos;s here on the island .
so , what ? how you supposed to find it ?
about a month after he disappeared ,
he sent me a postcard .
yeah ? what &apos;d it say ? did it mention the money ?
no , he didn &apos;t mention the money .
he just wrote , &quot; wish you were here . &quot;
it was a picture of this remote area on oahu
with a rock formation and a couple of palm trees .
danny !
hey , danny ?
in here .
you were right .
yeah . um ... except for the fact that , uh ,
reyes said that matty owed him 18 @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half million dollars .
you see , this is only $ 13 million .
are you sure ?
yes , i am positive-- i counted it three times .
so , matty must have taken some to help himself disappear .
yeah .
and now i am , uh , five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half million dollars short .
and i have two days to come up with all of it ,
or , um ... my brother &apos;s dead .
hey , i &apos;m here to see ko .
he doesn &apos;t like talking to cops .
i understand . uh , i &apos;m not here as a cop , though .
okay .
that &apos;s it .
i &apos;ll get back to you .
what is he doing here ?
i , uh ... i need a favor .
listen , steve told me about the money .
i figured you &apos;d come here first .
well , he turned me down .
danny , that &apos;s a good thing .
the last thing you want in this world is to owe a man like ko .
right . well , if it meant saving my brother ,
i &apos;d go for it , you know ?
i hear that . but there are other ways .
really ? i &apos;m short five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half million dollars .
i really don &apos;t see any other ways .
i may have one .
aloha and welcome to honolulu international airport .
please proceed to baggage claim to collect all checked bags .
we hope you enjoy a wonderful stay in our island paradise .
mahalo .
excuse me , mr. bristol ? gordon bristol ?
i &apos;m gordon bristol .
sir , can you please come with us ?
what &apos;s going on ? have i done something wrong ?
why did you come to hawaii , mr. bristol ?
why does anyone come to hawaii ?
see the ocean , work on my tan .
is that a problem ?
is this your bag , sir ?
yes .
mr. bristol , we randomly search luggage for security reasons ,
and your bag came to our attention .
would you like to explain
why you were transporting a weapon onto the island of oahu ?
there &apos;s been a mistake .
i ... have never seen that before in my life .
i don &apos;t even own a gun .
mr. bristol ,
illegal transportation of an unregistered firearm ,
as well as being in possession of a sound suppressor
are felonies in the state of hawaii ,
as well as being a violation of federal statutes .
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re gonna be detaining you ,
pending federal arrest .
if you &apos;ll please stand up ,
place your hands behind your back .
was fur ein spiel .
unglaublich , wie wir zuruckkamen ,
um zu gewinnen .
what a match .
i am surprised we came back to win .
all right .
coconut shrimp .
sweet and sour sauce ?
all you can dip .
from the ocean to the deep fryer ,
to your sophisticated palate .
i am most pleased
that our midfielders played with aggression .
surveillance suspect sounds like a robot .
that &apos;s a computer program .
the guy in the bookstore is speaking german ,
and i don &apos;t speak german .
it is also fortuitous that the keeper cleared the foot
to prevent the equalizer from drinking .
and your robot needs to work on its english .
so , i take it there &apos;s been no chatter
about the counterfeiting ?
no , just a bunch of talk about soccer .
but i &apos;m convinced our guy &apos;s gonna broker a deal
with the german to unload his counterfeit money any day now .
or ... maybe they just like soccer .
you know , in other countries , they call it football ?
doesn &apos;t seem right .
trust me , he &apos;s just luring his buyer
with a mutual affection for sports .
just laying the groundwork for the deal .
and when he makes it , i &apos;ll be listening .
so i take it you &apos;re gonna need more shrimp .
i &apos;ll just throw it on your tab .
in my experience ,
the key to surveillance is patience and stamina .
your experience ?
trust me .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before he slips up and proves me right .
got a real mess in there .
our suspect is traveling under the name gordon bristol .
that &apos;s an alias .
we know that he boarded the red eye from detroit last night .
his luggage gets flagged ...
because of this .
beretta 92fs ,
with an extra 15 @-@ round clip and a cobra sound suppressor .
that &apos;s not exactly a sportsman &apos;s gun .
where is this guy bristol now ? what happened ?
oh , he escaped .
but not before he took down five guys in the tsa holding room .
five guys ?
took down five guys by himself ?
with his bare hands .
all right , lou , listen to me :
contact detroit pd .
let &apos;s get them prints , surveillance photos ,
whatever we can of this guy ,
see if they can tell us who he really is .
all right , you got it .
gas must be cheap these days , &apos; cause this is the second time
that you &apos;ve come out here for nothing .
i &apos;m not here about my problem with ia .
right .
because if you were , you &apos;d be on your knees ,
begging me to tell them you didn &apos;t take my bribe .
well , if the truth still matters ,
i &apos;ve got nothing to worry about .
good luck with that .
looks like you &apos;ve been having trouble making friends in here .
i got enough friends on the outside .
so do i.
i &apos;m here about one of them .
let me guess . this pal of yours is in trouble .
needs some sort of financial assistance .
this isn &apos;t for me .
and there &apos;s a clock on this .
he &apos;s almost out of options .
how much help does your friend need ?
five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half million dollars &apos; worth .
oh , is that all ?
and if the money isn &apos;t there ?
my friend &apos;s brother dies .
tell your friend i &apos;ll give him 500 for a black suit .
we &apos;re done here .
guy &apos;s real name is stegner , first name joseph . 38 years old .
no known employment history
outside the construction business .
he owns a house in west bloomfield , michigan--
tony little suburb outside of detroit .
this guy lives pretty high on the hog for somebody
who supposedly spent his whole life swinging a hammer .
got a criminal record ?
well , according to detroit pd ,
stegner &apos;s name &apos;s been connected
to a few beat @-@ downs and a couple homicides ,
the first being a gunned @-@ down union boss ,
and the second a juror who was killed in a hit and run .
now , stegner has been brought in a few times
for questioning on both these murders .
never charged .
okay , so organized crime
is alive and well up in the motor city .
yes , sir .
and according to his jacket ,
stegner is supposed to have close ties
with the bagosa family .
and what do we know about them ?
the bagosa family is one of
the 24 original crime families .
now , most people , when they think of detroit ,
they think about either cars
or being the murder capitol of the country .
the bagosa family is one of the most active
crime syndicates in the country .
and that is because of this guy .
albert bagosa ,
third @-@ generation crime boss .
rules with an iron fist .
the guy simply will not tolerate dissent .
okay , so bagosa sends
stegner down here to do a job , with his tools .
he gets snagged by a random bag check ,
is detained and then escapes , right ?
right . the question is , who is the target ,
and is stegner still planning on taking them out ?
hey , security cameras at the ward center
just picked up our suspect .
well ... you gotta give the guy some credit .
he ain &apos;t scared of too much .
well , he left the airport in a hurry .
he &apos;s probably trying to drain all of his accounts
before they get shut down .
all right , that atm is in the center of the mall .
kono , use those security cameras to track him out of there .
and call hpd , tell them to secure the perimeter .
every street . we &apos;re on our way .
got it .
kono , you got him ?
he &apos;s heading east , past the movie theaters .
hpd has the perimeter locked down .
hey , i got him .
i got him .
easy , easy .
a lot of collateral .
we &apos;ve been compromised .
kono , don &apos;t lose him .
he &apos;s headed for ala moana .
hold it right there !
hold it right there !
don &apos;t move !
get down on the ground !
on your knees , put your hands behind your head .
okay , okay ...
i don &apos;t have him .
does this make any sense to you ?
a contract killer comes into town to do a piece of work ,
and then he &apos;s the one who gets taken out .
could be the intended target finds out about stegner ,
decides to get preemptive and gets the jump on him .
if that &apos;s the case ,
our man is no ordinary mark .
he took out a major bad @-@ ass from 100 yards away
and then escaped a police cordon .
great . so we traded up .
commander , hpd just found the suspect &apos;s vehicle
abandoned at george street .
detective williams is already on the way .
go , go ahead . i got this .
you find anything ?
look like you hit him .
hey , pua ?
have csu process this vehicle
and get officers searching every hospital on the island .
all right ?
yes , commander .
you really think this is the kind of guy
that &apos;s going to go to the hospital ?
maybe we &apos;ll get lucky
and he &apos;ll drop dead before it &apos;s a consideration .
i &apos;m starving .
what did you end up getting ?
same as usual . can &apos;t go wrong .
i know . i love this place .
it &apos;s always so good .
you try the spicy ?
it sneaks up on you , right ?
hey , man . it &apos;s cool .
take it to go .
all right , take it easy , sir .
still no word from chin ?
no .
you know what , partner ?
we can get on a plane right now and settle this .
you see , that is why i love you , buddy .
you &apos;re always willing to risk both of our lives at any given moment , huh ?
listen , man , i &apos;ll go through the door first
if it makes you feel better .
oh , you would ?
what &apos;s up ?
danny , i &apos;m sorry .
look , you &apos;re just gonna have to set new terms .
go down there in a couple of days ,
give reyes half the money , and then tell him
he &apos;ll get the other half when matty &apos;s released .
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great .
what happens when he finds out i do not have the other half ?
that i am five and a half million dollars short ?
and what does he do ? he comes here , and he takes grace ?
i can &apos;t do that . okay , this thing ends ,
and that son of a bitch gets every penny , okay ?
thank you for trying .
so i ran that blood you guys found
in your gunman &apos;s car and got a hit .
meet nick mercer .
michigan authorities say he is a highly skilled and proficient
contract killer for the bagosa family .
that &apos;s the same crime family stegner worked for .
okay , so we got one hit man killing another hit man .
what are we looking at here ?
family feud ? personal vendetta ?
maybe stegner offended bagosa in some way ,
or there &apos;s an internal power struggle amongst the help .
or maybe mercer wanted a contract
that was given to stegner .
oh . if you &apos;re right ,
then we need to identify who the target is .
unless the job &apos;s already been done .
man you &apos;re looking for is a ruthless ,
stone @-@ cold contract killer .
i &apos;ve worked organized crime all over the country--
new york , chicago , miami .
never seen anything like mercer .
he &apos;s a world @-@ class house painter
whose expertise is the &quot; white death , &quot;
that is , making people disappear .
mostly jurors , witnesses , cops trying to do their job ,
anyone who can potentially hurt the bagosa family .
he &apos;s rumored to have over 100 kills ,
and we &apos;ve never been able to touch him .
he &apos;s that good .
you just know he &apos;s been there
because his victims are never seen or heard from again .
on the street , they call him &quot; valentine . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s cute .
why valentine ?
because people who know him say he doesn &apos;t have a heart .
100 kills means he has a lot of enemies .
killing stegner must have just put
the bagosa family at the top of that list .
unless the hit was sanctioned ,
valentine &apos;s going to have to pay for it .
all right , agent chapman ,
what have you got on this man &apos;s personal life ?
not much . a surveillance package was assigned to him ,
but the judge wouldn &apos;t renew the request
after it yielded no suspicious activity .
we do know he spent some time at a hospital recently ,
following a car accident ,
but we can &apos;t get the medical records .
bagosa brought in his own team of doctors to perform the surgery .
you said the accident was recent ?
yeah , two years ago .
after that , valentine dropped off the grid ,
then presumably returned back to work , never skipping a beat .
and here &apos;s what you need to know :
this man &apos;s efficient .
he doesn &apos;t linger , he doesn &apos;t collect trophies .
there &apos;s no ego involved in what he does .
and if he &apos;s still on your island ,
you can expect some more bodies .
there &apos;s too much blood .
i can &apos;t even see the bullet ,
let alone assess the damage .
if it hit an artery , and i extract it ,
you could bleed out .
let us give you something for the pain .
do i look like someone who cares about pain ?
she &apos;s trying to help .
focus .
donna , stabilize this .
you want to tell me who shot you ?
maybe where it happened ?
anyone you want us to contact ?
look , i can &apos;t get to the slug
without a cat scan or an x @-@ ray .
let us take you to the hospital .
straub clinic is only a few miles down the road .
we can be there in ten minutes .
dumb move , slick .
we found him . he &apos;s on the move .
hpd received a 911 call ,
and they got a lock on the ambulance he stole .
i got him . hold on .
oh , no .
i was hoping he wouldn &apos;t do that .
punch it ! he &apos;s getting away !
i got my foot on the floor here .
seriously ?
seriously ! all right , you know what ?
let &apos;s get something straight here , chicago .
i don &apos;t like it when danny criticizes my driving ,
the same goes for you .
you got it ?
would you relax your giggle hole ?
my what ?
listen .
it &apos;s not a criticism .
i think you drive fine . i &apos;m just saying
i think the camaro would come in handy right about now .
you don &apos;t say .
he &apos;s slowing down !
what the hell &apos;s he doing ?
hands ! let me see your hands !
moving .
get out of the vehicle right now !
he &apos;s lost a lot of blood .
call an ambulance .
isn &apos;t this ironic ?
how you doing ?
i &apos;m lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett , five @-@ o.
this is lieutenant kelly , captain grover .
now we know who you are , valentine .
and we also know that you work for albert bagosa .
see , the thing we can &apos;t figure out
is , uh , is why you would kill your ,
your associate joseph stegner .
was it business or was it personal ?
a little of both .
well , you could &apos;ve whacked stegner back in detroit ,
saved yourself the airfare .
why fly all the way out here to do it ?
have you ever been to detroit in the wintertime ?
yeah . walked right into that one .
all right , how many more people on your list ?
i &apos;m not here to kill anyone .
i &apos;m here to protect people .
what people ?
the ones bagosa hired me to take out .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so you expect us to believe
that you didn &apos;t fulfill those contracts ?
if you wanted the truth ,
that &apos;s it .
all right .
why the change of heart ?
sometimes things happen that ...
change a person &apos;s perspective on life .
well , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s some deep and soulful stuff
for a man who &apos;s killed over a hundred people .
two years ago ...
middle of a thunderstorm ,
i got into a head @-@ on with a moving van with bad brakes .
doctors said i suffered
a traumatic ventricular failure .
that there was a 100 % certainty i would die
if i didn &apos;t get a new heart .
okay , how &apos;d you get to the top of the list ?
you gentlemen forget who i work for .
man like albert bagosa doesn &apos;t get wait @-@ listed .
i needed a new heart .
he got me one .
not that he had any great affection for me .
he just needed me to get back to work .
i was told ...
that my heart belonged to a very special young man .
he taught at about the worst school in the city .
served meals at the local soup kitchen .
built houses for the homeless during his summer break .
then one day , this solid citizen , this ...
man who lived to make a difference ,
got hit by a drunk driver while crossing the street .
and it was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me .
&apos;cause i got a piece of him .
after that , things changed .
went about my business the way i always done it .
but when it came to the moment of truth ,
couldn &apos;t go through with it .
just couldn &apos;t pull the trigger .
and it kept happening contract after contract .
something happened when i got that new heart .
i began thinking of the people i was asked to kill .
their loved ones .
their families .
what did they do to deserve me ?
okay . well , if your story &apos;s true ,
that can &apos;t have made mr. bagosa happy .
i never told bagosa .
every contract i got ,
i pretended to fill it .
so , what about all the people you &apos;re supposed to kill ?
what happened to them ?
i found a safe place to hide them .
you created your own witness protection program .
that &apos;s right .
an entire community made up of people that didn &apos;t deserve to die .
but somehow bagosa found out .
then how is it that you &apos;re still walking around ?
i &apos;m that good .
that &apos;s why bagosa sent stegner to hawaii , huh ?
to kill those people that you &apos;ve been hiding ?
those people are innocent .
i couldn &apos;t let stegner end their lives .
you think i &apos;m lying ?
i think you just told a really great campfire story .
the only things missing are the marshmallows .
the only way we can know if you &apos;re telling the truth
is if you tell us where you stashed those people .
so where are they ?
if i tell you , i put those people at risk .
that &apos;s just not gonna happen .
boy , i have heard some fairy tales
in 30 years as a cop ,
but this one beats all of &apos; em .
it &apos;s out there .
but i give him points for originality .
if he made it up ,
it was well @-@ rehearsed .
come on ... you &apos;re not buying this , are you ?
every gun @-@ for @-@ hire has an exit strategy ,
in case he gets pinched .
this guy &apos;s story is probably just something
to distract us from what he &apos;s really here to do .
yeah , or it &apos;s real and he &apos;s telling the truth .
we gotta dig into this . we gotta dig into this .
let &apos;s see if detroit can corroborate .
lieutenant kelly .
i &apos;ve been thinking about your friend &apos;s situation .
and ?
maybe we can do a little quid pro quo .
that is , if my welfare means anything to you .
it doesn &apos;t .
just keep talking .
turns out some of the guys in general pop
don &apos;t like the fact that i &apos;m related to five @-@ o.
well , maybe you should have thought of that
before you killed my father .
look , what &apos;s done is done .
nothing can change that .
but what can change is your friend &apos;s situation .
tell me what you want .
immediate transfer to the special holding unit
at the high security facility .
there i &apos;ll get a private cell and private rec time ,
and for that ,
i am willing to pay five and a half million dollars .
so i was able to track down paperwork
from a surgical supply company
verifying valentine &apos;s heart transplant .
it was all paid for by bagosa .
but there &apos;s not much more post @-@ surgery .
valentine said he stashed those people somewhere ,
which means he could &apos;ve bought land .
the problem with valentine is that he &apos;s in a cash business .
right . so it &apos;s unlikely
he &apos;s the kind of guy that &apos;s gonna use his real name on anything ,
so there &apos;s no financials ,
no way to trace any real estate transactions .
then where the hell
is valentine hiding all these people he was supposed to kill ?
my assistant said you rang .
yeah , your mom didn &apos;t sound too happy when i called .
is everything all right ?
eh , she &apos;s got seller &apos;s remorse .
hey , congrats on selling your house .
not my house . it &apos;s my mom &apos;s .
which means i &apos;m in the market for a new basement ,
if any of you are looking for a friendly nonsmoker
willing to trade light housework for room and board .
well , if you hear of anything then .
cool . how can i help ?
so , listen , if somebody wanted to live off the grid ,
jerry , and i &apos;m talking like big brother @-@ fearing ,
无所不在的老大哥 监视所有人的一举一动
income tax @-@ avoiding , way , way off the grid ,
where would they go ?
we &apos;re talking no phone service ,
no nosey tourists ,
no contact with the outside world .
what they &apos;re trying to say is where do
your like @-@ minded friends all live ?
how many people we looking at ?
maybe a dozen , possibly more .
right . and it &apos;d need to be a place that has the resources
to sustain a community like that for a long period of time .
so you &apos;re saying ,
like , if amelia earhart had come to hawaii to fake her death
最后通信在豪兰岛附近
instead of howland island ?
ye ... sure , jerry .
well , that &apos;s easy .
two places : west coast of molokai
or the lanai rainforest .
if you wanted to disappear , either place would work .
right .
special agent chapman .
any progress on your end ?
i &apos;m afraid we have a new development , commander .
what &apos;s that ?
one of my most reliable c.i.s just told me a plane chartered by
one of bagosa &apos;s front companies left detroit four hours ago
headed west with a manifest of six .
and they just lost contact with the plane .
we &apos;re pretty sure they &apos;re avoiding radar contact .
you got trouble headed your way .
six guys , a lot of muscle .
they &apos;re not just coming for valentine .
they &apos;re coming for the people he &apos;s hiding , too .
we gotta move .
listen to me very carefully--
if you care about those people that you &apos;re hiding ,
you need to tell us where they are right now .
what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s a plane in the air , with six guys on it--
they &apos;re coming here to finish the job your pal stegner couldn &apos;t .
all right , so i &apos;m gonna say it one more time :
if they mean anything to you , anything at all ,
you need to give us their location , you understand ?
how do i know you &apos;re not lying ?
you tell us where they are , you can help us save them .
they &apos;re five miles from here .
in an abandoned summer camp .
i made a map for you .
all right , thanks .
it &apos;s all there , just like we agreed on .
okay . mahalo .
let &apos;s go .
spread out .
generator is running out of fuel .
somebody &apos;s gonna have to go into town for supplies .
i can do that tomorrow morning before it gets too busy .
i &apos;ll tell the others , get them to make their lists .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;re running low on some of the essentials .
we &apos;re gonna need some more batteries ,
and i think we &apos;re pretty low on fishing line .
it worked .
told you . hey , how about a little love for the maestro ?
good work , jerry .
thanks , sistah .
jerry , i got movement .
one diversion , coming right up .
hey , have you seen my pocket knife ?
did you lose it again ?
maybe one of the kids took it .
i don &apos;t believe it-- toaster &apos;s broken again .
little help , here .
freeze !
hello , boss .
do you have any idea what you &apos;re doing , valentine ?
asking you politely to put down your gun .
you know me better than anyone .
i &apos;ll blow your damn head off right here .
take him away .
my pleasure .
i saved your life .
in ways you &apos;ll never know .
all right , you want to step this way , sir ?
got a nice little cage for you .
thank you .
let &apos;s go .
all right , it &apos;s all here-- five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half million .
you &apos;re gonna maybe tell me where , uh , where it came from ?
anonymous donor .
that donor wouldn &apos;t happen to ,
be somebody who &apos;s related to you , would it ?
he was , once .
he means nothing to me now .
this is gonna cost you in ways that you could not possibly predict .
you know that , right ?
why don &apos;t you let me worry about that .
you just worry about getting your brother back .
okay . thank you .
thank you , brother .
yeah .
i mean it .
you made it with an hour to spare .
you brought a little friend , too-- that &apos;s nice .
look , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s all there , okay ?
just , uh , let me see my brother now .
please .
you &apos;re right .
deal &apos;s a deal .
all right .
matty ! matty ! matty ! it &apos;s me !
do you want to take him with you
or would you prefer that we ship him ?
danny ...
danny !
get up ... get up !
all right . okay , all right .
all right . listen to me .
do yourself a favor and kill me now ,
&apos;cause i promise you-- i promise you ,
i &apos;m gonna put you in the ground the first chance i get .
no , you listen to me :
take some advice : go home .
and if you love your daughter ,
you won &apos;t ever come back to colombia again , do you understand ?
fernando !
what &apos;d i just tell you , huh ?
what &apos;d i say ?
what &apos;d i tell you ? huh ?
what &apos;d i say ?
okay . look at me .
you look at me , look at me , look at me .
that &apos;s it .
