you look good .
how would you know ?
well , if she starts seeing him again ,
you only have yourself to blame .
you have to convince her it &apos;s not too late .
we are trying to have a baby .
and we have a donor .
it &apos;s timothy .
we want all of you to be on board .
really important to mama .
how aobut your car keys ?
jesus ...
he &apos;s drunk !
mind your own business .
let him go ! he &apos;s not driving , ok ? i am .
just stay away from me .
mom , are you ok ? let &apos;s go home .
i &apos;m sorry , do i know you ?
zac , your son .
can you think of any reason
someone would go through all this trouble
to make this fake id and plant it in your purse ?
all i have to do is tell them you set her up
because i bought back the ids .
what ids ?
the kids we sold to aren &apos;t gonna talk .
it &apos;s your word against mine .
i know who did this .
oh yeah , who ?
it was me .
don &apos;t do this , brandon .
stefanie foster ?
your son gave me money to change my story to say that i wasn &apos;t there
the night that your partner killed evan .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
i want 10,000 dollars .
then you &apos;ll never see me again .
what ?
i gave the money to ana so she &apos;d change her story .
i was ...
wait , wait , wait . you bribed her ?
no , it wasn &apos;t ... i just wanted her to ...
to lie ?
no , she was already lying .
i just wanted to make sure dad didn &apos;t go to prison or something .
does anyone know about this ?
no .
no one ?
no one .
ok , you cannot tell anyone about this , brandon .
not until we figure out what to do . do you understand ?
yeah , yes .
i mean it , i &apos;m serious .
this could end up very badly if this gets out .
ok .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was ... really trying to help .
well , at least no one knows .
ana does .
so ?
so , she came to me the other day and
threatened to go to the da with it , unless i give her money .
you &apos;re kidding .
ten thousand .
why is this the first time i &apos;m hearing about it ?
because she said , &quot; your son gave me a bribe . &quot;
and i just assumed it was jesus .
i asked him , he had no idea what i was talking about .
it never occurred to me ...
it could be brandon ?
so what are we going to do ?
you can &apos;t pay the woman , that &apos;s a crime .
and what &apos;s to stop her from going to the da anyway ?
or coming back again and again and demanding more .
we have to do something . because if she goes to the da with it ,
he &apos;ll think that you put brandon up to it .
they &apos;ll reopen the case and he &apos;ll use it against you .
that freakin &apos; woman , i could kill her .
hey , take it easy .
ok .
so , how do we make this go away ?
well , &quot; we &quot; are not going to do anything .
you are going to stay as far away from that woman as possible .
i will handle ana , ok ?
ok .
i want brandon to come home .
you didn &apos;t think i was going to find out ?
no , mike .
i was worried about you . you have had such a hard time lately .
and brandon , he didn &apos;t want to upset you ,
ok ? so i did a stupid thing .
yeah , you did .
i did it to protect you .
protect me ? from what ?
i was worried about your sobriety .
oh , come on . give me a break .
i don &apos;t need that kind of protection .
because of you , stef is making him move back home .
she can &apos;t do that .
she can !
she has custody . she can do whatever she wants .
get out .
what ?
get out ! we &apos;re done !
please !
you know what ? no .
you can get your stuff tomorrow . get out of here .
i &apos;ve told mike that brandon is coming home .
do you think he &apos;s ready for that after what he did tonight ?
he &apos;s going to have to be .
the whole confession was a lie anyway , lena .
the part about him setting up callie was a lie ,
but the rest of it ? i &apos;m not so sure .
well , callie and jude are being adopted on monday .
so he &apos;s got to get over it . now .
why was he selling fake ids to begin with ? i don &apos;t understand it .
i mean , what could he possibly need that much money for ?
good news is we didn &apos;t have to arrest him .
what about school ? what &apos;s sanchez going to do ?
i gave her the names brandon gave you .
maybe one of them will give up vico .
but i &apos;m pretty sure that she &apos;s going to expel him .
what happened to our son ?
i don &apos;t know .
mariana . good morning .
good morning , mrs. rogers .
hey , honey .
i will let you two snugglebugs alone .
she seems ... ok today .
yeah .
but last night ...
... she didn &apos;t even know who you were .
does that happen a lot ?
i don &apos;t know . sometimes .
and sometimes she thinks you &apos;re your dad .
yeah .
look , zac . she needs to get some help ,
she needs to see a doctor .
you don &apos;t understand .
what ?
she ...
she has alzheimer &apos;s .
she what ?
she &apos;s so young .
it &apos;s called early onset or something .
she &apos;s not even that bad yet .
i mean , this is why i didn &apos;t want us to start dating .
i just really need to take care of her right now .
but who &apos;s going to take care of you ?
look , besides , if she gets put into a home or something ,
they &apos;ll make me go live with my dad .
so i &apos;d have to leave you .
and i really don &apos;t want to leave you .
so i will get you the money .
meet me tomorrow at the diner on alavera at three . you know it ?
but on one condition .
once i give it to you ,
you are out of our lives forever , ok ?
ok .
i mean it .
i get you that 10,000 and i never want to see you again .
it &apos;s &quot; open the chest . &quot;
jude , you have a phone call .
i do ? who is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
hello ?
it &apos;s a girl . who do you think it is ?
yeah . ok ...
i have to ask my moms first .
who &apos;s jude talking to on the phone ?
he looks all nervous and twitchy .
i don &apos;t know . some girl .
maybe you could give him some advice ?
me ? advice on girls ? yeah , that &apos;s not a good idea .
what do you mean ? smooth operator like you ?
well , emma seems to think
i &apos;m more of a jackass than a jack of hearts .
演唱者 neighbors
she &apos;s not even talking to me .
why ?
i got up in kyle &apos;s face at the dance .
what ?
well , you kind of have been a jerk lately .
look , i know you hate it when i get all sisterly on you
and i give you advice and stuff ,
and i know how much you really wanted to get off your meds ,
but i gotta tell you ,
i kind of want my brother back .
who was that ?
maddie from school .
maddie ? what did she want ?
um ... she just wanted to know
if i wanted to go see a movie with her next week .
she did ?
what did you say ?
i said i would ask my moms and let her know at school tomorrow .
do you want to go , like ...
do you like her ?
no . no . not like that . no .
are you sure ?
yeah . yeah , no .
then is it ok if i ask her out ?
yeah . sure .
so , i talked to your mom .
she &apos;s fine if you wanna go back tomorrow ,
so you can work on your audition and focus ...
dad .
i &apos;m really sorry .
for everything .
didn &apos;t think ... - no .
no , you didn &apos;t .
and i &apos;ve never been so disappointed , brandon .
so you read the donor contract ?
i did , i did . and ...
i don &apos;t think i can sign it .
i really thought i could do this ,
but when i actually read the contract , and saw it all laid out ...
i couldn &apos;t get past the idea
that there would be this kid in the world
that came from me ,
who i wouldn &apos;t get to love or hold or play with .
i ...
i think it would just destroy me .
i &apos;m sorry .
what if you &apos;re already pregnant ?
i know , i know that .
that &apos;s why i stopped
to get a blood test at urgent care on my way home .
and ?
it &apos;s not instant , honey .
it &apos;s going to take 24 hours .
ok , this is what i was worried about . using a donor that we know .
we should never have inseminated before he signed the contract .
is this ... are you saying this is my fault ?
because you were the one who agreed that
we should do it while i was ovulating .
yeah , because it was pretty obvious how much you wanted to do it .
ok .
let &apos;s just hope that ... that you &apos;re not pregnant .
stef , if you don &apos;t ... want me to have a baby ,
you need to say it .
i don &apos;t want you to have a baby , lena .
honey ...
so we &apos;re getting adopted tomorrow ,
and after that , there &apos;s ...
no , you know , going back .
yeah , i know .
yeah and i just feel ever since i got here ,
i &apos;ve been ruining your life .
no , callie , no .
i don &apos;t want to do that .
you &apos;re not .
really ?
brandon , i want this .
i want to be a part of this family
more than i have ever wanted anything in my whole life .
if there is one thing that can make me blow this all up ,
it &apos;s knowing that i &apos;m hurting you .
am i ?
hurting you ?
no .
are you sure ?
yeah .
lena ? honey ?
you &apos;ll be happy to hear that i just got my period .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
i am not happy , i &apos;m sorry about what i said ...
i know how much you want this
and i want you to have everything you wanted ,
but when i think about a baby , a little tiny helpless person ,
i get so overwhelmed .
the kids are all having a rough time , one way or another ,
and every time they make a mistake , i feel like it &apos;s my fault .
like , i am screwed , i &apos;m screwing this up , i &apos;m screwing them up .
they &apos;re just teenagers . they &apos;re just making teenage mistakes .
remember you asked me why
brandon needed all that money from the ids ?
he used it to bribe ana .
ana ? not the twins &apos; ana .
so mike wouldn &apos;t go to jail .
and ana , being the delightful person that she is , showed up
and demanded 10,000 dollars from us or she would go to the da .
so , what are we gonna do ? you &apos;re not going to pay her .
no , i &apos;m not going to pay her .
i &apos;m going to wear a wire and
record her trying to extort a police officer .
hello ?
yeah ?
brandon ...
callie came by .
oh , no .
what happened ?
she &apos;s over me .
you poor thing .
what are you doing ?
isn &apos;t your audition tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i &apos;m not going to let you blow it . it &apos;s time for bed .
sit .
take off your pants .
wow . bossy .
where &apos;s your phone ?
in my pants .
i want to set your alarm .
so you can &apos;t hit snooze , okay ?
i don &apos;t want you missing this .
i &apos;m sorry ... about everything .
you know ? my dad .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s not your fault .
sucks about callie . you deserve better .
before you know it , you &apos;re going to find her ,
someone who appreciates
just how kind and amazing
and handsome
and talented you are .
演唱者 ourlives
brandon , it &apos;s me , dad .
i love you .
i love you and i feel like i &apos;m failing you as a dad
and i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry i was mean today .
i know i messed everything up and ...
and you &apos;re a good son and i &apos;m sorry .
hi , this is dani . you know what to do .
uh , hey , it &apos;s brandon .
sorry to bother you .
it &apos;s ... look , i know it &apos;s kind of weird that i &apos;m calling .
but i just got a message from my dad that he left last night ,
and he sounded super drunk ,
and he &apos;s not home yet and i &apos;m kind of freaking out .
uh , have you seen him ?
if you hear from him , or anything , will you let me know ? thanks .
so did you ask your moms ? about the movie ? can you go ?
um ... yeah . they said it was ok .
ok , cool .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t like her .
so i changed my mind .
you only like her &apos; cause i said i do .
no , that &apos;s not it .
it doesn &apos;t matter . she doesn &apos;t like you .
she likes me .
yeah , whatever .
you know what ? i don &apos;t think i can come to your adoption thing today
since it &apos;s just for good friends and i &apos;m obviously not a good friend .
没见到他 不过知道他一般待在哪里 我去找他 不要担心
brandon foster .
so , i talked to my moms .
i &apos;m going to go back on my meds .
i know that wasn &apos;t an easy decision .
so , are you still going out with that kyle jerk ?
why do you ask ?
what do you think ?
no .
can we start over ?
i don &apos;t know .
really ?
you &apos;re gonna be like that ?
how about we wrestle for it ?
are you sure you want to take that chance ?
with your record ?
i always wins when it counts .
our folks are inside .
talking to sanchez .
this is all your fault , you know ...
oh , yeah ?
it &apos;s my fault you set up callie ?
i told you i was gonna hit you where it hurt .
well , nice . now we &apos;re both gonna get kicked out of school .
relax .
nobody &apos;s getting kicked out .
dude ...
we made fake ids in the school machine .
you brought booze to the winter dance .
my parents are taking care of it .
they &apos;re founding members of the charter ,
my mom &apos;s head of the parent board .
she basically signs sanchez &apos;s checks .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re gonna get away with this .
you think i &apos;m getting away with this ?
my dad &apos;s a total bastard . he &apos;s making me quit wrestling .
so ?
so i was going to get scouted .
i was going to get a scholarship .
finally get out from underneath his thumb .
but not anymore .
life &apos;s crazy , you know ?
one minute , you &apos;re just cruising along ...
next minute ?
someone swoops in and kills your dream .
oh , hey , bubby .
painting them for the big day ? are you excited ?
you ok ?
when did you know you were gay ?
what do you mean ?
there &apos;s this ... this girl at school , maddie ,
and connor wanted to go out with her ,
and i got all , kind of , jealous , i guess .
ok . that happens .
but i don &apos;t think i &apos;m jealous about maddie .
oh , honey .
that &apos;s ... totally normal .
not normal , that &apos;s not what i mean .
let &apos;s not use the word normal at all .
honey , everybody gets jealous
when their friend gets a boyfriend or girlfriend .
everybody .
and it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that you &apos;re gay or that you &apos;re not .
and if you are or you &apos;re not ,
it really doesn &apos;t matter to us either way .
we love you no matter what because you &apos;re you .
i know .
ok . i &apos;m going to go get changed .
ok .
she was doing some ironing and came into my room .
演唱者 kate york
and she didn &apos;t know who i was .
she started screaming
and i tried to get the iron out of her hands ,
and she , um ...
she hit me .
i finally got her to watch some tv .
you &apos;ve got to do something about this .
this ... this is not ok .
she &apos;s going to hurt you even worse or somebody else or herself .
uh , yeah , linda ?
it &apos;s me , zac .
is my dad there ?
hey , dad , it &apos;s me .
all right . i need some help .
mom &apos;s really , really sick .
hey .
i found him . he &apos;s fine .
he is ? are you sure ?
yeah , he &apos;s been drinking .
he &apos;s going to need to sleep it off , but he &apos;s ok .
thank you for doing that .
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s all good .
bye .
you haven &apos;t seen ana , have you ?
she went out yesterday and never came back .
one of the residents did mention that
they saw her get in a screaming match with some guy .
i just hope she &apos;s ok .
ok , thank you .
what happened ?
were you in a fight ?
hey , i &apos;m here ! this is so exciting .
hi , babies . all right , let &apos;s do this .
hey , can i talk to you for a sec ?
yeah .
so , how &apos;d it go with sanchez ?
gonna have to start looking for new schools for brandon ?
no , thank god , but ...
but what ? she &apos;s not expelling him . that &apos;s great , right ?
of course , but she &apos;s also not going to do anything about vico .
there &apos;s something wrong with that kid .
really ?
yeah , this is why this entire thing will go away .
because sanchez is afraid of vico &apos;s parents .
it just makes me furious .
so , did you meet with ana ?
uh , no . she didn &apos;t show .
she wasn &apos;t at the halfway house when i went there after .
they said she never came home last night .
so , now i &apos;ll have to wait till she shows up again .
listen , are we ok ?
i ... i said some things yesterday that i know hurt your feelings .
i thought about what you said ,
and i think you &apos;re right .
we &apos;ve got all these beautiful kids and ...
... they need us right now .
really ?
really .
uh , it &apos;s just ...
i heard back from urgent care and ...
i didn &apos;t start my period . it was just spotting ...
... because i &apos;m pregnant .
i thought when i heard those words i would feel ...
i don &apos;t know what i thought i &apos;d feel but ...
i feel nothing but love right now , baby ...
love for you and for this beautiful baby we &apos;re going to have .
oh , my god ...
oh , baby .
i &apos;m so happy .
you ok ?
yeah , it &apos;s just ...
it looks like zac is going to have to move in with his dad for a while .
oh , yeah ?
in arizona .
that sucks .
it &apos;s ok .
i just want him to be safe .
yeah , of course you do .
but you finally get a boyfriend and ...
yeah and yeah .
i just ...
i feel like everyone i love ends up leaving .
that &apos;s not true .
you didn &apos;t have to come .
are you kidding me ?
and look who i found outside .
what ?
hi !
damn girl , it &apos;s adoption day !
we &apos;re so happy for you and i &apos;m so proud of you .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
yeah .
sure .
over here .
hey , you got my message ? i wasn &apos;t sure you &apos;d come .
well , it &apos;s for family and friends , right ?
um , i &apos;m sorry about the whole maddie thing . if you like her ...
no , i don &apos;t know .
maybe all three of us can go see a movie sometime ?
hey , connor .
hey , callie .
i can &apos;t believe this is about to happen .
we &apos;re about to get adopted .
hey , guys . hey connor , how are you ?
can we talk to you for a sec ?
yeah .
so , there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s a problem with the adoption , with callie &apos;s paperwork .
what ? what is it ?
the court needed your original birth certificate .
there were only duplicates in your foster care file .
and when they got yours ...
there was a different name listed for father .
so , donald isn &apos;t my dad ?
not according to the birth certificate ...
it says , robert quinn ?
does that name mean anything to you ?
um ... well , quinn is my middle name .
but mom told me it was a family name , so ...
what does this mean ?
we don &apos;t ... really know .
we &apos;ll talk to donald .
see what he knows .
we &apos;ll figure something out , i promise . ok ?
but until then ...
i &apos;m not getting adopted .
not today , but you are getting adopted , callie . we promise .
well , i &apos;m not getting adopted without you .
no , jude . we have waited too long for this day , ok ?
i &apos;m not going to let you do this .
but ...
no , it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . hey , i &apos;m ok , all right ?
today is your day .
and you are going to walk into that courtroom
and officially , officially , officially
become a member of this family , ok ?
ok .
ok ?
ok .
ok .
yeah . here we go , ok ?
i &apos;m just going to step out and get some air .
callie ...
i &apos;ll be back in a minute .
what happened ?
it &apos;s a really good thing .
what did you wear ?
i love your dress .
oh , thank you .
callie ? hey ! hey !
callie ? what &apos;s going on ? what happened in there ? what ?
i , um ... i can &apos;t get adopted .
apparently , there &apos;s something wrong with my birth certificate .
i feel like ...
... nothing ...
... nothing ever works out , you know ?
like the whole freakin &apos; universe is against me .
i &apos;m gonna let you in on a little secret , cal .
the universe isn &apos;t against anybody .
i know it feels that way right now ,
but i &apos;m telling you , that &apos;s not how it works .
life is a mixed bag .
we all get some good and we all get some bad .
the more time that you spend figuring out all the ways
that the world is trying to screw with you ?
well , the more you &apos;re going to find .
listen , this sucks . i know . big time .
and i don &apos;t know how this is going to end .
i don &apos;t know how this is gonna play out .
but i know you .
i know when it gets hard that you want to run .
but i &apos;m telling you , you got to fight that .
sometimes you &apos;ve got to stick
around long enough for your luck to find you .
it &apos;s still true , you know .
yeah . i &apos;m ok . promise .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
think i &apos;m gonna go get my stuff from my dad &apos;s .
we haven &apos;t even cut the cake .
no , i &apos;ll have some later .
just want to get it done , you know ?
ok .
you &apos;re getting really good .
i &apos;ve been practicing .
maybe we can jam a little when i get back home .
yeah , i &apos;d like that .
wait , brandon , i forgot .
what happened with the audition for the symphony ?
oh ... i got it .
you did ?
yeah .
that &apos;s amazing .
thanks .
ok .
i need to know something .
if you can &apos;t or if you &apos;re not going to be able to get adopted ,
does that change anything ?
about brandon ?
no .
no , it doesn &apos;t change anything .
play me something .
ok .
