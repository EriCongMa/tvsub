awake
you &apos;d think this kid would learn how to text by now .
anyway , reid says his mom &apos;s doing much better
and he misses us .
that &apos;s great news .
ohh . good morning , jj .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on , a little morning @-@ after blues ?
wait , let me guess , let me guess .
date night .
romantic dinner and a movie .
derek , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what it is .
come on , come on , come on . there was probably
a little wine involved to set the mood
and then you finished it off with a little hanky panky .
i &apos;m way off , aren &apos;t i ?
you &apos;re cute .
but the only action happening at our house at 3 a.m.
is a colicky baby .
gas ? i &apos;m guessing a lot of it .
yeah .
colicky . i knew that .
i knew that .
hi , i &apos;m tara lewis . it &apos;s great to officially meet you .
same here . i &apos;ve heard so much about you .
so i &apos;m assuming sleep is a thing of the past at your house ?
uh , you know , everyone said two was a game @-@ changer .
we were expecting twice the work , but wow .
hey , rossi .
where &apos;s hotch and garcia ?
i thought we had a case .
we do , but they &apos;re behind closed doors .
is this about the network of hitmen ?
yeah .
any update ?
nothing yet , but hotch has pulled out all the stops .
how &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s got 4 hitmen targeting her ,
so she &apos;s a little rattled .
yeah , i heard something about witness protection .
let &apos;s hope it doesn &apos;t come to that .
for how long ?
until we can produce a viable lead .
you &apos;ll be here and an agent will be assigned to you
until further notice .
this is horrible .
witness protection wanted to move you to another state .
i convinced them that you would be safer here .
thank you for that .
um , ok , i need to go home and get my creature comfort things .
garcia , this starts now .
what do you-- what about sergio ?
i have plants i need to water--
make a list and i &apos;ll send someone to pick up whatever you need .
ok . um ...
wait .
thank you . oh--
who &apos;s getting the stuff ?
anderson .
oh , he can &apos;t see that .
but i really need it .
garcia . let &apos;s get to work .
right .
the phoenix division is requesting our help
with two recent abductions , one of which has led to murder .
ok . 5 days ago the body of steven jackson
was discovered on a rural road just outside the city .
he was reported missing after missing several shifts at work .
which brings us to our second victim , lance coleman .
according to authorities , 3 days ago he was due home
in phoenix from a business trip in tucson .
and security footage shows him entering the airport ,
but the flight manifest says he never got on the plane .
it &apos;s as if these two vanished .
on average , over 90,000 people go missing each year .
54 % of those are men .
only 15 % return alive .
their preliminary m.e. report shows deep ligature marks
and lacerations on steven &apos;s wrists .
he was likely restrained for an extended period of time .
which means the unsub has a secure secondary location
where he holds them captive .
it says here steven suffered repeated burns
and contusions all over his body .
extreme torture . the unsub &apos;s found an outlet for his aggression .
no obvious signs of sexual assault .
the torture could be what &apos;s getting him off .
that makes sense . he gets sexual gratification
from inflicting psychological and physical suffering on his victims .
well , this level of violence suggests that it &apos;s personal .
maybe it &apos;s about revenge . these two crossed the unsub ,
now he wants to make them pay .
or at the very least , he &apos;s using them as surrogates
for the true target of his anger .
it &apos;s possible he was testing to see just how much torture
steven could take before he &apos;d break .
well , coleman &apos;s been missing for over 72 hours .
if revenge is the unsub &apos;s motivation ,
he could already be dead .
unless we have reason to believe otherwise ,
we have to assume lance coleman &apos;s alive , and we need to find him .
wheels up in 20 .
over here !
oh , god !
over here !
this is chopper 482 . we have a visual on lance coleman .
i repeat , we have a visual on lance coleman .
help me !
help me .
wake up !
i said wake up .
no .
no .
look at me .
look at me .
we &apos;re just getting started .
&quot; you can chain me , you can torture me ,
&quot; you can even destroy this body ,
but you will never imprison my mind . &quot;
mahatma gandhi .
hey . uh , did you want a cup ?
oh . right , right . the whole , um ...
yeah .
yeah . i &apos;m still nursing .
that &apos;s ok . only 45 days , 3 hours , and 6 minutes left ,
but who &apos;s counting ?
you &apos;re really not messing around .
no , you don &apos;t stand between a woman and her caffeine .
well , listen , when your sentence is up ,
first cup &apos;s on me .
deal .
besides being residents of one of the hottest--
and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re all pleasant @-@ looking ,
but i &apos;m talking fahrenheit here--cities in the country ,
i can &apos;t find any connections between the victims .
garcia , what about lance &apos;s credit cards ? any activity ?
uh , his last transaction was a car service to the airport .
besides that , it &apos;s a ghost town .
both vics appear to be low @-@ risk .
it speaks to the unsub &apos;s confidence .
steven looks like he practically lived at the gym .
they couldn &apos;t be more physically different .
well , he definitely lived the bachelor &apos;s lifestyle--
single , he rented a studio apartment ,
worked freelance as an overnight security guard .
lance coleman was the opposite .
he &apos;s a family man .
been married to his wife karen for nearly 20 years .
and he also owned his own business .
he would take weekly commuter flights to tucson
to meet with potential investors .
maybe the unsub &apos;s motivation is business related , not personal .
garcia , see if steven ever worked security for lance &apos;s company .
gotcha .
all right , so how did he get to these guys ?
i &apos;m leaning towards a blitz attack .
these look like electrical burns .
the unsub could be using some kind of taser .
both victims went missing while traveling at night .
that speaks to the unsub &apos;s knowledge of their schedules .
he may have stalked them over an extended period of time .
which is how he knew the most opportune moment to strike .
there are no witnesses , no cameras .
they &apos;re simply gone .
he targeted these men for a reason .
the sooner we find out why , the sooner we find lance .
agent hotchner ? thanks for coming out .
agent webster , this is agent jareau , agent rossi .
welcome . right this way .
so we checked local hospitals and accident reports .
no one matches coleman &apos;s description .
what about tucson ? any leads there ?
they &apos;re coming up empty , too .
have you been able to get ahold of steven jackson &apos;s family ?
his parents live up north .
they &apos;re driving in as we speak .
and mrs. coleman ?
she arrived 5 minutes ago . figured you want to talk to her first .
i have you guys set up in here . right this way .
thank you .
hi , mrs. coleman ?
i &apos;m agent jareau .
please sit .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , you don &apos;t need to apologize .
i haven &apos;t slept since ...
that &apos;s understandable .
mrs. coleman , when was the last time you heard from your husband ?
3 nights ago .
is that typical ?
he hates being away from us .
we have a rule that he won &apos;t spend
more than two nights away on business .
and did he ever break that promise ?
not in 20 years .
at what point did you realize he was missing ?
not until i woke up and he wasn &apos;t there .
i called his cell. voicemail .
i tried the hotel .
they said he was gone .
and that &apos;s when you knew something was wrong .
this coming weekend
we were going to be celebrating our anniversary .
he &apos;d been planning a getaway for months .
there &apos;s no way lance would have missed it .
what have you got , garcia ?
i &apos;m trying to locate the last ping of lance &apos;s cell phone ,
but i can &apos;t narrow it down to an exact tower yet .
how is that possible ?
ping @-@ a @-@ cell 101 . if i could direct your attention to the map .
according to his last ping at 11 p.m. ,
the signal was bouncing off a tower in benson , arizona .
but that doesn &apos;t fit the timeline .
the security cameras show him entering the airport at 11 : 10 p.m.
it doesn &apos;t make sense . what makes even less sense
is that 5 minutes later , the signal was bouncing
off a tower in drexel heights 50 miles away .
that &apos;s impossible .
yeah , this is what i &apos;m saying .
the signal is tower hopping . it &apos;s giving a false read .
because the cell tower was full .
correctamundo . the signal will automatically
bounce to the next available tower even if it &apos;s out of the city .
that means the unsub &apos;s hunting ground
may be a lot bigger than we thought .
the brutality the victim experienced was immense .
he suffered facial fractures , burns , and extensive bruising .
have you determined c.o.d. ?
i haven &apos;t finalized my findings ,
but preliminarily i &apos;d say he died from cardiac arrest
induced by electric shock .
still trying to figure out what caused these .
look at him . this is complete overkill .
well , the fact that the
unsub is stepping up his method of torture
could mean he &apos;s getting frustrated .
it &apos;s possible he &apos;s ex @-@ military .
it would explain his knowledge of multiple torture techniques .
or the guy used google .
trust me , i &apos;ve seen all sorts of crazy stuff .
well , that wouldn &apos;t be the first time
someone used the internet as a killing manual .
well , typically these type of tactics
are used to get a confession or information .
what caused these ?
it appears at some point during the torture ,
the killer staples his eyelids open .
that is sadistic .
it might be symbolic .
the victims could have turned a blind eye
to something that affected the unsub .
and now he &apos;s punishing them for it .
the worst part is , it was done while this guy was still alive .
this unsub wanted steven
to anticipate and witness his own torture .
open your eyes .
you know where she is .
i swear , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
tell me .
please just let me go .
no ! no , please !
i need the location .
ok . ok . i &apos;ll tell you .
i &apos;ll tell you .
focus !
steve was a good guy .
hope you find the psycho who did this .
we have every intention .
have at it .
let me know if there &apos;s anything else you need .
thank you .
well , no signs of a struggle or forced entry .
the unsub didn &apos;t abduct steven from here .
according to his supervisor ,
he was supposed to start his shift at 3 a.m.
so his drive would have been about an hour .
the alarm is set for 1 : 15 a.m.
that &apos;s about right .
single guy . i &apos;d say 15 minutes , max , to get ready .
well , he &apos;s a security guard .
which means he wears a uniform every day ,
so he wouldn &apos;t have to think about wardrobe choices .
which puts us at 1 : 30 a.m.
so he brews a pot of coffee , pours a cup .
sports fan . probably checked last night &apos;s scores
before he headed out at 1 : 45 .
keys are gone .
his car was missing from his parking stall .
then the unsub must have intercepted him
at some point between here and work .
which begs the question , what did he do with steven &apos;s car ?
according to dmv records ,
steven jackson drove a &apos; 91 mustang .
older model , so no gps .
i went ahead and issued an apb on his car .
hopefully we get a hit soon .
hey , baby girl , you &apos;re on speaker , what &apos;s up ?
ok , i did some spelunking
and found that after coleman missed his flight ,
he used not his personal but his company credit card
to foot the bill for a rental car .
well , it &apos;s about an hour and a half drive ; he probably
figured he &apos;d make it home before his wife woke up .
can you track down the rental car &apos;s gps ?
i already meowed up that tree .
it is disabled . but i am piecing together
the gps history as we speak .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re the best , mama .
oh , don &apos;t i know it .
he could have taken a number of different routes
back to phoenix . highway 77 , 87 , or 10 .
well , he would have taken the fastest route back .
that &apos;d be interstate 10 .
ok , what if he &apos;s abducting them off the road ?
this could be about road rage .
a perceived slight while driving might have made them a target .
an extreme case of road rage that leads to abduction and murder .
but if that &apos;s true , the victims &apos; cars
would have been abandoned . both are still missing .
what if they &apos;re carjackings ?
think about it : the unsub lies in wait ,
he blitzes the victim at an intersection ,
and then he drives off in their cars .
so these victims weren &apos;t targeted ,
they were picked at random .
wrong place , wrong time .
it is possible he used a similar ruse like gary lee sampson ,
who posed as a hitchhiker and preyed on good samaritins .
probably waves down a passing car .
hi . hi , sir . thank you .
i don &apos;t mean to ...
and appears lost or incoherent .
i had an accident down the road .
i was hoping you could get me to a phone or something .
claims his car broke down , his phone is dead .
he needs directions or a ride .
thank you so much ,
i really appreciate it .
and the next thing you know ,
you &apos;re looking down the barrel of a gun .
and the good deed is punished .
i told you i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
oh , my god ! honey !
oh , i was so worried ! i thought ...
everything &apos;s going to be all right .
why didn &apos;t you just tell him ?
what are you talking about ?
you should have given him the location .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
just let me go .
please , just let me go .
please .
i have a family ! don &apos;t do this to them .
you have children ?
yes .
yes , my daughter .
she &apos;s 12 .
oh , god , please , i &apos;ll do anything .
crime scene techs are done , so it &apos;s ours .
they just made a positive id .
it &apos;s lance coleman .
well , he definitely amped up the torture .
it looks like this time , the cause of death
was a single gunshot to the head .
we profiled he &apos;s a sadist .
he would have inflicted as much pain as possible ,
not end the torture so abruptly .
well , he decreased the time he held on to the victims ,
but he definitely increased and accelerated the torture .
then it &apos;s not about pain for the thrill ;
he wants something from them .
but if that &apos;s true , maybe lance gave the unsub
what he wanted and he was no longer of use to him .
it &apos;s possible steven &apos;s death was an accident .
yeah . he died before the unsub was finished with him .
we need to deliver the profile .
the unknown subject we &apos;re looking for
is a sadistic inquisitor ,
which means that he &apos;s aroused sexually
and emotionally by causing pain
in the service of eliciting information .
the unsub gets off on the fact
that his victims put up resistance .
it allows him to push the torture even further .
we think he &apos;s a white male ,
in his thirties to early forties
who &apos;s physically fit enough to subdue male victims .
he &apos;s goal @-@ oriented , driven by rage ,
which makes him extremely brutal in his torture methods .
this unsub exerts power and control over his victims ,
making them feel completely helpless
until they give him whatever it is he &apos;s looking for .
based upon his systematic torture ,
it &apos;s possible the unsub is suffering from some sort of ptsd .
given the sheer amount of work and effort
he puts into torturing his victims ,
we think there &apos;s a deep @-@ seated personal reason
for what the unsub is doing .
it &apos;s possible he appears unassuming with limited social skills ,
which is why he chooses to hunt at night .
he plays on his victim &apos;s good will and sympathy
before he blitzes them and abducts them from their vehicles .
because of the escalating torture ,
we believe this unsub is becoming
both increasingly desperate and volatile .
this unsub is driven by a compulsion ,
a need @-@ based desire .
because these men are surrogates ,
there &apos;s a good chance his victims will never be able to
give the unsub what he ultimately wants .
understanding his motivation will be the key to finding him .
thank you .
drink . drink .
drink . drink .
why are you doing this ?
where &apos;s the tattoo ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
did you burn it off ?
i never had any tattoo !
please just let me go .
i think you have the wrong person .
do you know why you &apos;re here ?
no , no , no , please don &apos;t do this ! please don &apos;t do this !
please don &apos;t do this ! no , no , no , no , no !
ballistics confirm the gun used to kill lance
was the same one registered to steven jackson .
i &apos;ve got men canvassing gas stations , rest stops ,
any place where the unsub might have
come into contact with the victims .
so far , no solid leads .
hey , tell me something good , boo .
i managed to partially piece together lance &apos;s gps history ,
and i &apos;ve got him on a route
that takes him right up interstate 10 .
that &apos;s the exact same route the first victim
would have taken to work .
lance coleman wouldn &apos;t have been on that highway
if he hadn &apos;t missed his flight .
so this is where both victims &apos; paths crossed with the unsub .
this must be the nexus .
i10 &apos;s one of the most traveled roads in the country .
it stretches from california to florida .
highway serial killer &apos;s paradise .
garcia , run our profile
against the hsk database .
check for any potential suspects connected specifically to i10 .
i &apos;m on it .
how much are you willing to bet
that whatever that unsub is looking for
is somehow connected to this highway ?
what do you want from me ?
i don &apos;t know what you think i did .
i can help you . just--just give me a chance .
unchain me ! now !
hey , come back here .
i said stop !
caffeine .
i am a fan . what about it ?
you want your victims to stay awake and alert
for what you &apos;re about to do to them .
so you give them caffeine .
wow , astronomical levels , apparently .
wait , how did you ...
oh , yeah , sorry .
wait , why would he do this again ?
well , there are a variety of reasons .
the caffeine would open up their arteries ,
which would increase their nerve sensitivity ,
and in turn , enhance their pain levels .
sleep deprivation .
so the torture isn &apos;t about his anger ,
it &apos;s a reflection of what he &apos;s going through .
he wants them to stay awake .
you will tell me where she is .
no .
we just received news of another abduction .
david whitfield . reported missing an hour ago .
his employer confirmed that he clocked out
1 : 30 yesterday morning .
but according to his roommate , he never made it back home .
where does he work ?
an old auto factory off interstate 10 near canton .
fits the geographic profile and the timeline .
this guy has a precise m.o.
how much of the interstate
is isolated enough for abduction ?
a couple of gas stations , a diner , and a few rest stops .
nothing really pops out .
not to mention , there are far more
secluded stretches of interstate .
why does he keep coming back to the same area ?
play it again , daddy .
again ?
we &apos;ve been playing it since we hit the road .
please ? please ?
will you sing with me ?
no , honey , you know daddy can &apos;t sing .
you can try . please ? please ?
* you &apos;ll never know , dear *
* how much i love you *
* please don &apos;t take my sunshine away *
hey , daddy . you &apos;re my sunshine .
green for go .
hey , mama , listen up .
we need you to focus on a particular stretch
of interstate 10 between chandler and phoenix .
look for any accidents involving male drivers
on that stretch of highway .
keep it coming .
we know the unsub &apos;s keeping his victims awake ,
so look for any accidents
where the drivers fell asleep at the wheel .
uh , ok ,
i am not finding any sleep @-@ related incidents within that radius .
we know that the time of abduction is important to him .
widen the search to take in any accidents
that occurred between 1 : 30 and 2 : 00 a.m.
despite on the i @-@ 10 , there &apos;s like an accident every 45 seconds ,
i &apos;ve got zilch .
ok , we know this was
a recent trigger , so expand your search parameters
to look at incidents reported within the last few months .
what did you find ?
i don &apos;t know if i found anything .
i found a report citing sleep deprivation ,
but it &apos;s not an accident , it &apos;s a child abduction .
here we go . i managed to find the original
police report from 3 months ago .
ok , a 43 @-@ year @-@ old william taylor
was driving i @-@ 10 near chandler , arizona .
it was late ,
around 11 : 30 .
he was with his 5 @-@ year @-@ old daughter tatiana .
they were returning from a dance recital .
it says here , he just worked a double shift at the salvage yard
which he owns . he was super sleepy .
he pulled off around midnight to a rest stop .
he attempted to close his eyes for 10 minutes ,
woke up hours later and his daughter was missing .
i can &apos;t imagine-- a parent &apos;s worst nightmare .
there &apos;s your trigger .
he &apos;s torturing them for answers
about his daughter &apos;s abduction .
yeah , in his mind , he believes his victims were involved .
garcia , any viable suspects ?
uh , no , the police canvassed the whole rest stop ,
and they came up empty . there &apos;s still no leads .
hold on .
according to taylor ,
there was a man with a skull tattoo on his hand
who knocked on his window moments before he fell asleep .
the guy told taylor ...
i just wanted to let you know your taillight is out .
thanks , thanks , thank you , thank you .
like you said , taylor might have been suffering
from sleep deprivation himself .
it &apos;s likely he was in a micro sleep
and he imagined the man with a skull tattoo .
and like any parent would be , the unsub is riddled with guilt .
and in his mind , he wasn &apos;t able to protect her and keep her safe .
and now in his delusional state ,
he believes each of his victims
is that man with the skull tattoo .
he &apos;s forcing his victims
to take responsibility for his own guilt .
if he hadn &apos;t fallen asleep at that rest stop ,
his daughter might still be with him .
so he forces his victims to stay awake
as he wishes he had .
work and home address just sent .
i &apos;ll let hotch know .
where &apos;s my daughter ?
i don &apos;t know !
tell me !
no , no !
where &apos;s your head at right now ?
i -- i just don &apos;t understand what happened a week ago
that turned a grieving father into a killer .
it could have been the stress from the case .
all the leads went cold and the guy just snapped .
and the not knowing &apos;s the worst part .
hotch , you &apos;re on speaker .
there &apos;s something you should know --
the police found tatiana &apos;s body .
please , don &apos;t do this , i &apos;m begging you !
where &apos;s my daughter ? !
william taylor , step out of the vehicle
with your hands where we can see them .
i got him . that &apos;s the man
with the skull tattoo . he &apos;s right there .
that is not him , william .
damn it , why aren &apos;t you listening to me ?
that man has my daughter !
no , he doesn &apos;t .
yes , he does .
and i &apos;m going to find her and i &apos;m not going
to let him get away from me again .
all right , william , william , listen to me , ok ?
you and i both know they found tatiana .
they found my little girl ?
yes , a week ago . william ,
you were there .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you remember the volunteers , the search party ?
william , think back .
tatiana &apos;s remains were found in the desert
not far from the rest stop .
no , no , no , no . that was not her .
she &apos;s still out there .
think about tatiana , william .
think about what she would have wanted .
hey , daddy , you &apos;re my sunshine .
she &apos;s alive , and i &apos;m going to find her .
&quot; guilt is perhaps the most painful companion of death . &quot;
coco chanel .
oh , sorry .
wow . kids really are game @-@ changers , aren &apos;t they ?
yeah , how is it that i wake
up more exhausted than when i went to bed ?
why don &apos;t you try to get some shut @-@ eye before we land ?
oh , trust me , i &apos;ve tried , it &apos;s not happening .
hey , rossi .
i remember reid told me once ,
uh , i think it was something like this --
hey , morgan ,
you know electronics emit
a sleep depriving type of blue light
that prevents you from falling asleep at night .
yeah , i remember that .
i actually think it was more like --
well , studies show
that we need between seven and nine hours
of sleep a night .
works like a charm .
hotch ...
what do you think happened to william &apos;s daughter ?
well , the police report assumed
that because he didn &apos;t have child locks on his truck ,
that she wandered off into the desert for some reason .
you know , i saw where they found the body .
there &apos;s no way she could have found her way
back to the road .
well , the way the temperatures drop in the desert at night ,
she didn &apos;t stand a chance .
yeah , but , hotch , you should have seen this guy .
i mean , up until the very end ,
he was adamant that a guy with a skull tattoo
abducted his daughter .
well , the unsub with a ghost in his mind
is always dangerous .
unless it wasn &apos;t all in his mind .
ugh , it &apos;s really coming down .
haven &apos;t you had enough of that thing ?
you know , once we get to grandma &apos;s house ,
she &apos;s going to make you put it away .
well , you better save some of that battery .
according to the gps , we have another ...
two hours ahead of us .
i think we should wait out the storm until --
didn &apos;t mean to startle .
just wanted to let you know your taillight is out .
it is ?
yeah , i was driving behind you
back on the interstate . saw you pull over at the rest stop ,
figured i &apos;d give you the heads up .
i appreciate it .
thank you .
you have a good night , ma &apos;am .
