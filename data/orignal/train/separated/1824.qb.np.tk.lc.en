paranoia ...
gives you an edge in the o.r.
what i realized is that-- is that peds
is the only specialty where i could do it all--
you know , cardio , general , ortho .
it &apos;s like the whole body is your canvas ,
and the fact that it &apos;s a small canvas
makes it even more challenging .
i mean , i have no idea
if you have someone on your service right now ,
but i would really love to witness your artistry .
you got this ?
mm @-@ hmm . you gotta like kids .
i love kids .
okay . i &apos;ll see you on rounds .
great .
oh , he lost a huge chunk of flesh .
i see down to his mandible . we &apos;ll need plastics
and an e.n.t. consult , too .
left i.v. looks like it &apos;s clotted off .
i need a new 16 gauge in there .
i got it i got it
whoa , whoa . what &apos;s going on ? it &apos;s 4 : 00 in the morning .
is everyone on call ?
it &apos;s the merger . everyone &apos;s scared to go home .
i don &apos;t think the chief meant that people couldn &apos;t sleep .
well , it &apos;s hard to sleep when your job is on the line .
one of you , get as much type @-@ specific blood
as they &apos;ll let you have and meet us in surgery .
me ! i got it ! i called it ! i called it ! no !
surgeons play out worst @-@ case scenarios in their heads .
i talked to callie last night
about the residents at mercy west .
she said they don &apos;t suck .
i mean , you &apos;re safe because of derek .
izzie &apos;s safe &apos; cause of cancer .
alex is bailey &apos;s new favorite .
you know , even george would &apos;ve been spared ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s owen &apos;s guy .
cardio has been a revolving door around here ,
and no one &apos;s got my back .
so arizona is your cover ?
she &apos;s merger @-@ proof . she keeps little kids alive .
no one likes a dead kid .
plus , they &apos;re under anesthesia half the time .
how bad can it be ?
you &apos;re ready to close , you got the bleeder ,
you know it , but there &apos;s that voice in your head asking ...
sloan and shepherd are scrubbing out of surgery in o.r .. two .
grab them before they leave .
let me know . if you hear anything about the merger .
nurses are always the last to know , first to go .
what if you didn &apos;t ?
what if the patient dies and you could &apos;ve prevented it ?
oh , alex ?
what do you think ? looks real , right ?
my mom sent it to me .
uh , wh @-@ what are you doing here ?
working .
iz , uh , we talked about this .
you &apos;re supposed to be taking another three weeks ,
really resting up .
i have to come back now ,
before i don &apos;t have a job to come back to .
iz--
i have to show people that i &apos;m not gonna die .
unless i sit alone in that trailer for one more minute ,
then i am gonna die . i &apos;m gonna die of boredom .
izzie--
seriously , it looks real , right ?
i mean , if you didn &apos;t know i have cancer ,
you wouldn &apos;t know i have cancer , right ?
so you check your work one more time before you close .
paranoia is a surgeon &apos;s best friend .
karev , what do you got ?
16 @-@ year @-@ old helmeted dirt bike victim .
g.c.s. 15 reported before intubation .
okay , on my count. ready ?
one , two , three .
i &apos;m gonna scrub in .
so he announces a merger ,
and then he shuts himself in his office all day
and refuses to talk to anybody .
this merger won &apos;t affect us .
it &apos;s just a financial restructuring .
what do you think restructuring is ? cutting personnel .
are you prepared to lose all the good people ?
i &apos;m not .
hey , tell hunt he &apos;s good to go .
i &apos;ll write up a consult later .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to richard right now .
you &apos;re tired . you &apos;re angry .
you &apos;re gonna say something you &apos;ll regret .
get outta here for a while .
go to the driving range , hit a bucket of balls .
i have a surgery in an hour .
so take a walk . grab meredith , take a walk .
meredith won &apos;t leave the hospital .
none of &apos; em will .
everyone &apos;s awaiting word from on high .
look , don &apos;t tell me lexie &apos;s not worried .
is he in there ? ! &apos; cause i &apos;ve got the--oh !
no . lexie &apos;s worried .
i think you missed a spot .
okay , you can &apos;t tease me about the blood thing
because it &apos;s not funny .
and if it gets back to the chief ,
i may as well just pack my things .
you need to stop worrying about the chief .
all this is in your head .
really ?
2002 , milwaukee ,
third street hospital merged with st. ann &apos;s .
13 residents were let go .
2004 , nashville women &apos;s absorbed memorial .
nine residents were fired .
2006 , albuquerque .
okay .
19 residents .
all right . whoa . stop .
you need to pull yourself together .
you deserve to be here .
act like it .
okay .
i meant later .
you know , after you went home and got some sleep .
you know , we really should get some sleep before rounds .
sleep is for wimps .
sleep is for mercy west residents .
let &apos;s , uh , fit in another trauma before rounds .
don &apos;t say anything about the wig .
i &apos;m back . yes , i am early .
but whatever . i &apos;m back .
and because i &apos;ve been gone so long ,
the first trauma that comes through those doors , it &apos;s mine . got it ?
it &apos;s amazing , right ?
what ? what &apos;s amazing ?
the wig .
yeah. mm @-@ hmm . oh , it looks so real , i couldn &apos;t even tell .
i &apos;ve always wanted to try out being a redhead ,
so i just thought , now &apos;s the time .
well , what &apos;s wrong with your own hair ?
that &apos;s peach fuzz chemo hair , and i really wanted
to put my patients at ease , make &apos; em feel comfortable .
she looks like a stepford wife .
you &apos;ve gotta tell her .
she can &apos;t handle it . just don &apos;t stare .
m.v.c. who do i have ?
hey , i &apos;m not your chief resident anymore . figure it out .
karev , let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re back .
i am .
my mom &apos;s whole church prayed for you .
thank you .
yeah . it looks really real .
i know , right ?
we need to talk .
look , i &apos;m busy right now .
are you making cuts ?
i said i &apos;m busy .
if you &apos;re making cuts in my department ,
you need to consult with me .
when it &apos;s appropriate ,
i &apos;ll consult the people i need to consult with .
people ? i &apos;m not people .
i &apos;m the guy that saved your ass .
when jennings came to me , you were done .
out of loyalty to you .
loyalty ?
you came to me so you would look like a good guy
before you stole my job .
are you making whole cuts or not ?
look , i said when i &apos;m ready to tell my staff
about decisions i will be making , i will ...
when i &apos;m ready !
so don &apos;t come barging in here like i owe you .
i don &apos;t owe you a damn thing , derek . you work for me .
i &apos;m still the chief of surgery at this hospital .
then start acting like it .
jodie crowley , 60 @-@ year @-@ old driver
who lost consciousness and hit a parked car .
vital signs stable . complains of abdominal pain .
it wasn &apos;t a parked car . it was them . they hit us .
uh , sir , who are you ?
who am i ? who are you ?
he &apos;s my son .
why don &apos;t we go in the waiting room ?
oh , no . he ... he needs to stay with me .
he &apos;s a paranoid schizophrenic .
okay .
all right .
let &apos;s put her on a gurney on my count .
one , two , three .
listen to me , mom .
they &apos;re ... they &apos;re trying to get to me through you .
you have to believe me .
tom , they &apos;re not real .
look at me . look at me , honey .
did you feel dizzy or light @-@ headed before the crash ?
no , i felt fine .
okay , abdominal tenderness . i feel a mass .
i ... i &apos;ve had it for quite a while .
maybe that &apos;s what caused me to black out .
i &apos;ve been warning her .
they &apos;re trying to hurt her , but she won &apos;t believe me .
tom , look at me .
you know i wouldn &apos;t lie to you .
no. no ! you have to believe me .
someone has to believe me .
aliens have impregnated my mother .
the chief was spotted five hours ago in the cafeteria .
he got an apple and a yogurt . and then he met with dr. shepherd .
the meeting was brief and heated . then he drew the blinds .
he &apos;s probably sleeping .
that &apos;s speculation . we have no proof of that .
you &apos;d make a good lawyer ... if this doesn &apos;t work out .
okay , dr. yang. you ready for rounds ?
yes. oh , um ...
continue with your course of treatment
and keep me updated on any new developments .
you know , you don &apos;t look ready .
no , i &apos;m ready . i looked over your patient charts ,
and i noticed you have a shock wave lithotripsy
scheduled for kidney stones this morning ,
and i was ... oh . i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;ve never done one of those ,
so i &apos;m looking forward to it .
okay . now you &apos;re ready .
oh . come on . let &apos;s go .
okay . thanks .
okay , how long have you had the growth ?
can you cover the clock ?
the number 5 bothers him .
uh , yeah . can you get something to cover the clock ?
are those cameras ?
tommy , what do we need from the store ?
why won &apos;t they leave me alone ?
tommy , do we need fruit ?
yeah . why won &apos;t you leave me alone ?
what kind of fruit do we need , honey ?
tom , what kind of fruit ?
um ... apples ,
pears , strawberries .
make a list .
could you give him a @-@ a pencil and some paper ?
yeah .
he needs something to distract him from the voices .
okay , uh , ma &apos;am , the growth ?
oh . uh , yeah . i &apos;m sorry .
i ... i &apos;ve had it for a while .
uh , i &apos;ve been meaning to get it checked ,
but as you can see ,
my son &apos;s illness is a full @-@ time job .
karev , i &apos;m gonna need you to get mr. crowley &apos;s wrist x @-@ rayed
while i get her up to m.r.i.
why can &apos;t one of these fetuses babysit ?
if that huge thing &apos;s a triple @-@ a , i want in .
i can do the wrist .
dr. karev has more experience .
the patient is paranoid and hypervigilant ,
which means he &apos;s bound to pick up on the fact
that dr. karev doesn &apos;t want to be here ,
and he may interpret that as dr. karev being out to get him .
i aced my psych clerkship .
hey . how &apos;d it go with the chief ?
richard &apos;s not talking to me .
what ? why ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s just ... he &apos;s not ... he &apos;s not himself .
well , what &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s hiding out .
oh . how are you holding up , hmm ?
you &apos;ve been up for , like , what , 36 hours ?
48 . but i &apos;m good , actually .
i feel like it &apos;s all gonna be okay ,
like we &apos;re all gonna keep our jobs
and we &apos;re all gonna be amazing people
and live amazing lives .
unstable childhood .
ah , yes .
i get calm in a crisis .
this is a crisis , right ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know what this is .
oh , look who &apos;s coming .
oh , um , dr. yang , have you seen sage ?
she &apos;s 6 , light brown hair , gorgeous blue eyes .
she just had a tumor removed from her belly ,
so she has a bandage on her tummy .
you know what ? hey , why don &apos;t you check under the bed ?
maybe she &apos;s there .
her labs are better than we expected .
uh , she &apos;s not under the bed .
huh . whoa . i ... mm. uh , maybe try the bathroom ?
maybe she slipped in there ?
how did she do last night ? did she get any sleep ?
she did . i didn &apos;t .
um , bathroom &apos;s clear .
wait . shh. shh , shh , shh .
i think that there &apos;s something
coming from your pocket .
is sage inside your pocket ?
no , no , um ... she &apos;s hiding here .
you gotta look in your pocket first .
no , i don &apos;t , because i found you already .
now i just need to check your incision site , so ...
don &apos;t touch it . it hurts .
you know , i bet that mr. bear would like to see sage &apos;s scar .
wouldn &apos;t you , mr. bear ?
yes , i would .
dr. stevens . i &apos;m surprised to see you back so soon .
you look great .
thank you . so do you .
how are you feeling ?
i feel great . how do you feel ?
no , what i meant was
i know what you mean . i feel fine .
i &apos;m ready to work .
here is mr. trinidad &apos;s latest pre @-@ op labs .
i told him you &apos;d stop in to say hello before the surgery .
and unless there &apos;s anything else you can think of that i need to know ,
i was gonna run to get his consent form .
that pretty much covers it
unless anybody has any questions .
is there anything you can tell us about the merger ?
because i &apos;m having a baby .
i mean my wife is having a baby .
i mean resident megan is having a baby .
i mean ... am i gonna lose my job ?
right now , i &apos;m concerned about my patient .
you should be , too .
i just got my hair cut .
oh . well , it looks nice .
the nurse out there , the one with the red hair ,
she &apos;s laughing at me .
you tell her i just got it cut , and they cut it too short ,
and that &apos;s why my ears are sticking out .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s not laughing at you .
how &apos;s that feel ?
it feels like my ... hand &apos;s falling off .
it feels like ...
they put something in it to make my hand fall off ,
like it &apos;s snakes or something .
you don &apos;t have a name tag .
um ... oh , i @-@ i @-@ i guess i don &apos;t .
the other doctor had a name tag on her coat .
i @-@ i had to change my lab coat ,
and this one-- you think i &apos;m an idiot ?
you &apos;re working for them. you &apos;ve got my mother ,
and now you &apos;re trying to get me .
stay away from us .
i keep telling you people to stay away from us !
i called security. they &apos;re on their way .
where &apos;s psych ? i asked you to page them an hour ago .
i paged them twice.if you want to see the log book
i @-@ i want to know how a paranoid patient
managed to get out of the e.r.
where were you ?
i had stepped away from my desk to deal with another patient .
and normally , being a punching bag for the doctors
is just a part of the job , but there &apos;s a merger ,
and we &apos;re all being looked at ,
and i am not about to go down for a mistake that wasn &apos;t mine .
so if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;ll page psych again .
okay , mr. trinidad ,
your shunt revision is pretty simple .
it shouldn &apos;t take longer than an hour .
but i do need to go over the possible complications with you .
dr. stevens , could i have a word ?
uh , if you could just give me a minute until i &apos;m done here , dr. karev .
i &apos;m sorry. this will only take a minute .
excuse me .
what ?
how are you holding up ?
fine .
did you take your meds this morning ?
not yet , but i will. you &apos;re supposed to take them at 9 : 00 .
it &apos;s only a little after 9 : 00 .
it &apos;s 10 : 15 .
run down to her locker and get her meds .
are they in your purse ?
yes , but you don &apos;t have to get them .
yes , you do .
no , you don &apos;t . alex
i swear to god , if you don &apos;t go and get her pills right now ,
i &apos;m gonna hurt you and i &apos;m gonna like it .
you can &apos;t do this. you can &apos;t treat me like i &apos;m sick .
my patients need to have faith in me .
what are you doing ?
your wig , it was crooked .
look , i &apos;ll stop hovering if you stop acting like an idiot .
your next pill is at 2 : 00 .
you can &apos;t take it on an empty stomach .
okay .
tyler lee , 9 years old , came in with renal colic
three days ago that has not resolved .
we are going to be performing
extracorporeal shock wave therapy today
to break up the stones in his ureter so they can pass .
no , we &apos;re not .
oh , uh , yes , we are .
no , we &apos;re not , &apos; cause there was no blood in his urine this morning .
we should do the procedure just in case ?
you want to do a surgical procedure on a 9 year old
even though it &apos;s no longer indicated ?
no , of course not .
okay. so , dr. yang , do you want to tell the good news
to tyler and his mom ?
it seems as though your son &apos;s stones
may have passed on their own .
he doesn &apos;t need surgery ?
no . looks like he healed himself .
can you believe that , dr. yang ? on your first day in peds .
no , i can &apos;t , actually .
does this mean i can eat ?
yeah , yeah. dr. yang can go get you something .
an abdominal aortic aneurysm--
8.7 centimeters .
this thing has a 75 % chance of rupturing .
yeah. she &apos;s a ticking time bomb .
i &apos;m surprised she woke up this morning , let alone got into a car .
okay , cancel all my elective surgeries this afternoon
and book an o.r.
we need to get her in there a.s.a.p.
okay , uh , jodie , we &apos;re done .
i &apos;ll meet you back downstairs to go over the results .
have you seen tom ?
i thought he was with you ?
he was , but he left .
well , he attacked me , and then he left .
he ... you told me you could handle this .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i ca--it &apos;s under control. don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ve called security . i just--i just thought maybe
his mom would have an idea
his mom has a triple @-@ a .
the last thing she needs to know
is that her mentally ill son is loose in the hospital .
i know this is bad . i know this is really , really bad .
i @-@ i know-- okay , i &apos;m gonna stop listening to you
because the words you are saying are hurting me .
find him !
yes .
you look crazy .
oh , this is partly your fault .
you &apos;re the one who told me to go act like i deserve to be here ,
and i did , and now i lost a schizophrenic .
and i am gonna be fired unless i find the schizophrenic .
well , you &apos;re not gonna find him back there .
you do not get to be charmed by this
because this is not charming !
this is me getting cut from the program .
you &apos;re already amazing . i am just starting out , okay ?
i have never stapled a bowel ,
and i have never resected an esophagus .
i am not amazing yet !
all right. let &apos;s just breathe .
and again .
good. look at me .
security is on this .
you have become a crazy person i do not recognize .
i want lexie back. can i get lexie back ?
stay away from me ! you get back !
oh , god , that &apos;s him .
stop ! get back !
just-- where &apos;s my mother ? what have you done with her ?
no ! all right , sir. just calm down. sir !
mrs. crowley , there is evidence that your son
may have suffered some injury in this fall .
now we don &apos;t think that it &apos;s bad ,
but we just need to do an ultrasound to make sure .
he &apos;s been sedated , but i need you to wait here
until we &apos;ve completed this , all right ?
i never shoulda left him alone .
i knew it . i knew it .
okay , um , mrs . crowley ,
i need to talk to you about your test results .
the wall of your aorta is dangerously thin
and could burst at any moment ,
and when that happens , it will most likely kill you .
i &apos;m not mincing my words right now
because i need you to understand the severity of the situation .
i need to take you up to surgery right now .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t have surgery right now .
i can &apos;t leave tom. he &apos;s injured. he &apos;s upset .
this has been a rough day on him .
i can &apos;t. no. it &apos;ll have to wait .
well , isn &apos;t there someone that you can call ?
no .
my ex @-@ husband left when tom first got sick ,
and friends have fallen away .
it &apos;s only me .
well , we have services , so , uh , we can arrange to--
i can &apos;t just leave him with a stranger .
i need time ...
to hire someone a @-@ a @-@ and train them
to know that if he &apos;s watching tv
and he &apos;s holding his head a certain way ,
it means the television is talking to him .
and he needs to be distracted .
he likes shopping ,
but they can &apos;t take him to the place on lee road
because he thinks they &apos;re out to get him .
so they have to go to the place on river road .
but they &apos;ve gotta park in the back ,
because underground parking makes him upset .
and it goes on and on and on .
so , no .
please
i need time .
a @-@ a week .
i &apos;ve made it this long . i can make it another week .
i &apos;m not sure that you have another week .
look , i need you to think about yourself right now .
i have a mentally ill son .
i don &apos;t get to think of just myself anymore .
hey . whoa . what are you doing here ?
oh , i was just , um ,
uh , i just stopped by to get some old case files .
for what ?
um , this job opening in portland .
oregon ?
yeah . uh , the merger .
i mean , the chief already got rid of me once , so
yeah . no , well , it &apos;s-- that &apos;s smart .
that &apos;s smart of you to have backups .
hey , uh , you know , i &apos;m working with cristina .
she &apos;s interested in peds .
no , she isn &apos;t .
yeah , she is .
okay .
well , what ? did she say something to you ?
she didn &apos;t have to . she &apos;s cristina .
oh , okay , you have to help me out here ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t know what that means .
i shouldn &apos;t say anything.she &apos;s my roommate .
and you &apos;re my girlfriend . girlfriend trumps roommate .
okay , fine . she &apos;s cristina . she &apos;s all about cardio .
so she &apos;s probably sucking up to you
to get through the merger .
i mean , is she good with the kids ?
oh . she &apos;s sucking up .
nice pin .
his name &apos;s mr. bear. he eats children .
not having fun in peds ?
well , my kid wants chocolate pudding really badly .
this is the last one .
my triple @-@ a got canceled .
you guys got any surgeries i can get in on ?
no , i &apos;m on post @-@ ops .
and she &apos;s babysitting .
i can &apos;t stand it any longer .
can &apos;t you go to the chief
and use your dead @-@ mommy connections to get some answers ?
we don &apos;t need dead mommy .
we are going to be fine .
okay , so i let a crazy man escape ,
and he fell down a flight of stairs .
is it surgical ?
i don &apos;t know . i got kicked off the case .
so then i went to go watch a surgery .
i figured , i can &apos;t screw that up .
and the second i get to the gallery ,
the shunt went south and starts bleeding .
i left before shepherd could blame me for it .
shepherd &apos;s shunt went bad ?
yeah , they had to convert to an open craniotomy--
something i &apos;ll probably never get a chance to do .
she can &apos;t handle a craniotomy .
see ? even he sees it .
no , he &apos;s not talking about you . he &apos;s talking about izzie .
i really admire you--
in case i get cut and don &apos;t get a chance to tell you .
plus , you &apos;re really pretty .
you can have the rest .
and you and i , we were getting so close .
i need to speak with dr. stevens , please .
alex , i &apos;m in surgery .
izzie .
alex , leave .
dr. shepherd ,
could you please tell dr. karev to leave ?
karev .
she gets tired walking to the mailbox .
she can &apos;t handle another 5 @-@ hour surgery .
i know what i can handle .
no one &apos;s gonna think any less of you if you walk out of here now .
just walk out now .
stevens , have this conversation outside .
no , i &apos;m not leaving . alex .
you paged me . what &apos;s going on ?
you have to tell the chief that you need me ,
that george was your guy , but he died .
so you need a new guy , and that &apos;s me .
okay ? right now. let &apos;s go . go , go , go .
oh , come on . if anyone &apos;s safe in this merger , it &apos;s you .
just be casual but firm .
he likes you . go .
cristina , i c--
i played hide @-@ and @-@ seek today and didn &apos;t go to surgery
because some 9 year old miraculously peed without blood .
okay ? i can &apos;t do this anymore .
then don &apos;t .
tell dr. robbins you don &apos;t think peds is your thing .
what is the big deal ?
the big deal is that the chief in there right now making a list .
you don &apos;t know that .
a list of who stays and who goes ,
and i can &apos;t be on that &quot; goes &quot; list .
if you are , you will deal with that .
&quot; if &quot; i am ? okay , if i--there can be no if .
i have to be on the &quot; stays &quot; list .
that list is everything . that list is my future .
it &apos;s my salvation .
the list is life .
schindler &apos;s list ?
you &apos;re comparing this merger to the holocaust ?
i &apos;m jewish . i &apos;m allowed .
you &apos;re irrational .
so this is a no ?
this is a no .
and somebody page sloan again , stat .
right away , doctor .
okay , elizabeth ,
take me through exactly what happened .
i was doing a crash c @-@ section on this 32 @-@ weeker .
i had the incision done in five minutes flat .
but i must have cut too deep ,
because when i went in to take the baby ,
i pulled the arm a little , and the--
oh , my god .
get me the umbilical cord .
umbilical cord ? wh--
just get it .
i got it . i got the umbilical cord .
good . give me about 5 centimeters of it .
what &apos;s going on ?
arm got damaged during a stat &quot; c . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna use the umbilical artery if it &apos;s still viable .
it looks a little dry .
it looks like it &apos;s gonna work .
she &apos;s stable .
let &apos;s put it in antibiotic solution
and move this party to the o.r.
i &apos;m sorry . i just , uh
i wanted to make sure that you &apos;re okay .
are you okay ?
i injured my spleen ,
and they &apos;re just waiting
to see if it stops bleeding on its own .
good. um
well , i &apos;m--i &apos;m glad you seem
well , you seem better ,
and i &apos;m glad .
anyway , i should , uh , i should go .
i &apos;m not really supposed to be here , so
oh , it &apos;s all right . they-- they &apos;ve got me in restraints .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to hurt you
even if the voices told me to .
it &apos;s a joke .
schizophrenia humor .
um ... there &apos;s this thought that i ...
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m trying to get it out , and , um ...
i keep thinking that they planted a camera ...
uh , in m @-@ my stomach during the ultrasound .
and i @-@ i was gonna wake my mother
and--and have her , you know , talk me down ,
but she &apos;s tired , and ...
here is ... your spleen .
see ?
and this , uh , this bright spot right here ,
that &apos;s--that &apos;s blood .
that &apos;s not supposed to be there .
but , um , no camera .
no camera .
mnh @-@ mnh .
i can leave this up if--if you want .
so that when the thoughts come back ,
you--you can look and you can see that--
that they &apos;re not real .
they &apos;re just scary thoughts .
they &apos;re not real .
thank you .
little more suction .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 , izzie .
oh , my god .
stevens , no more fighting in my o.r.
go deal with this .
i hate you .
shut up .
okay .
oh , god .
thank you .
shut up . get back to work .
hmm .
has mrs. crowley agreed to the surgery ?
no . she &apos;s gonna go home , and she &apos;s gonna die .
then what &apos;s that boy gonna be left with ?
he needs surgery .
w @-@ well , does he need a transfusion ?
is there active bleeding ?
no , his crit &apos;s stable .
and i know we don &apos;t operate unless there &apos;s an active bleed ,
but it &apos;s so close ,
and if we operate on him ,
maybe she &apos;ll let us operate on her .
that way , we can keep them together .
through the surgery , through the recovery ,
they &apos;ll be together . and maybe you think
this is a bad idea , that i &apos;m proposing unnecessary surgery .
and maybe you &apos;ll tell the chief ,
and the chief will think that it makes me a bad doctor .
but i think it makes me a good doctor , and i think--
stop talking .
are my words hurting you again ?
no , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s a good idea .
how does this happen ?
was chen just not paying attention ?
she made a mistake .
wrong time to make a mistake , with the merger .
oh , you people need to stop
with the doom and gloom merger scenarios .
i just read somewhere
that the hospital &apos;s revenues actually went up last quarter .
except for elective procedures , which went down 13 % .
you mean elective procedures like plastic surgeries ?
now you &apos;re saying that i &apos;m gonna get fired ?
i don &apos;t think anyone is safe .
i &apos;m safe .
how can you be sure ?
hey ! we &apos;re about to reattach a baby &apos;s arm here .
so we need to stop thinking about the merger
and think instead about this little girl
throwing a ball and holding a spoon
and waving bye @-@ bye to her parents .
no , i ... i &apos;m not letting you cut me open .
you &apos;re-- you &apos;re gonna put a camera in me .
you &apos;re-- you are one of them .
okay , mrs. crowley--
no . he &apos;s scared . he said no .
tom , you need this surgery .
and you will feel better after it . and your mom ?
your mom &apos;s surgery will save her life .
okay .
look , tom. look at me .
look at me. okay ? i am not an alien .
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m not one of them .
my name is miranda bailey .
i have a 3 @-@ year @-@ old son .
and i would do anything for him ,
just like your mom would do anything for you .
now she needs you to do this for her .
because otherwise , she will die .
and you will be alone .
look. see ? red .
red blood .
see ? i &apos;m human .
i am a doctor .
and i want to help you and your mom .
but you have to trust me .
okay , i think we &apos;re there .
if it pinks up , we &apos;ll know we &apos;ve done our job right .
releasing the bulldog clamps . here we go .
that &apos;s how i know my job is safe , dr. yang ,
because i reattach babies arms .
you know , it &apos;s not a good idea to piss off your attending .
oh , i didn &apos;t know he was upset . i &apos;ll apologize .
i wasn &apos;t talking about him .
sorry ?
i like kids and i like their parents ,
and i like to see them smile .
so i like going to get them pudding
and playing games with them ,
because it makes attaching their arms way more fun .
i don &apos;t like being used .
i wasn &apos;t u--
and i like being lied to even less .
what do we need from the store , sweetheart ?
tell me what we need from the store .
apples , pears , strawberries .
apples , pears , strawberries .
apples , pears , strawberries .
apples , pears , straw--
what if i don &apos;t make it ?
now you don &apos;t worry about that , okay ?
let me do that .
okay , let &apos;s go .
okay , the bleeding &apos;s stopped .
okay , let &apos;s close up .
stevens , scrub out .
no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m your resident . i got it .
someone else can close up .
you &apos;ve been on your feet for five hours .
you look exhausted .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re dripping with sweat .
all right .
okay , you know what ? just take my wig off .
just take it off . take it off .
okay , just pat down my head .
okay .
all right. you can just put the cap back on .
okay , thank you .
i &apos;m fine .
isobel stevens
spent five hours on her feet in surgery today ,
not because she was ready to go back to work ,
but because she was scared. she &apos;s scared for her job
and she was scared to show weakness .
you don &apos;t have to talk to me. that &apos;s fine .
but you need to go out there and talk to your people .
they need to hear from you .
don &apos;t tell me about my people .
i &apos;ve been here for 30 years , derek .
i know my people .
i have spent every hour of the last three days
trying to save every job i could .
but some tough choices had to be made .
h.r. is sending out an e @-@ mail to the first round of people to be let go .
richard
derek , i &apos;m tired . i &apos;m going home .
what &apos;s going on ? you paged us .
check your e @-@ mail .
for what ?
h.r. if you got cut , you &apos;ll have an e @-@ mail .
i didn &apos;t get one , but ... i &apos;ve been calm .
through this crisis , i have been calm .
but if one of us gets cut ,
i will not be calm .
no e @-@ mail . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m good , too .
good. see ? i knew it .
i knew it . i knew none of us would get cut .
yet . there &apos;s gonna be another round .
okay , so i &apos;m there
in the spleen repair with dr. hunt ,
and he &apos;s got the cautery
and he &apos;s moving it back and forth , you know ,
fixing bleeders ,
and then he just hands it to me ...
like it &apos;s the most normal thing in the world to do ,
like i repair spleens all the time .
and so i do it .
i @-@ i repair the spleen on my own .
and i just--i realized , you know ,
if we just focus on our jobs ,
if we focus on our patients , we &apos;re gonna be fine .
megan got cut .
i didn &apos;t , but she did .
what ? how ?
the chief sent out an e @-@ mail .
he fired three @-@ quarters of our class .
we &apos;re having a baby .
terry . hey , terry .
it &apos;s been a real pleasure working with you .
thanks .
sorry about everything .
okay .
so what did i do wrong ,
so i can learn for next time ?
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
this is about the money .
i &apos;ve ...
been here seven years .
all my friends are here .
i &apos;ll find another job ,
but ... it &apos;s seven years .
you have no idea .
it ...
look , if you need a job recommendation ,
anything , just call me , okay ?
rough day .
oh , i need some sleep .
okay , let &apos;s go home .
no , i can &apos;t . i just got kicked off of peds .
i &apos;m totally screwed .
cristina , come on--
no , i can &apos;t sleep . i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t leave if she &apos;s not leaving .
we &apos;re all susceptible to it ...
the dread and anxiety of not knowing what &apos;s coming .
no way .
are you serious ?
i &apos;m gonna go to the chief myself .
and i &apos;m gonna tell him
you &apos;re the best second @-@ year resident
i &apos;ve ever seen .
i &apos;m safe .
i didn &apos;t get cut , mark .
i &apos;m s--i &apos;m safe .
it &apos;s pointless in the end ...
i hate , hate , hate this merger
because i hate long @-@ distance relationships .
i don &apos;t believe in them .
so ... you can &apos;t move to portland .
well , when i mentioned it this afternoon ,
you didn &apos;t seem to mind .
you were like , &quot; move to portland . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know that i was allowed to mind .
i didn &apos;t know if we were girlfriends ,
but then , you said &quot; girlfriend . &quot;
you called me your girlfriend , so i need to know .
am i your girlfriend ?
yeah .
okay . good . mm .
so , yeah . no , you &apos;re not moving to portland .
no , but what you are gonna do
is you &apos;re gonna go into the chief &apos;s office ,
and you &apos;re gonna beg
i &apos;m not gonna grovel .
uh , yes , you are .
seriously , you don &apos;t want to mess with me .
because all the worrying ...
and all the making of plans
for things that could or could not happen ...
it only makes things worse .
i forgot he was dead today .
for a few hours in surgery ,
i forgot i had cancer and i forgot he was dead .
but george is dead ...
and you do have cancer .
i want you to keep doing what you love .
you &apos;re a great doctor .
and you have a fantastic future ahead of you .
but you gotta step up
and start taking care of yourself .
you gotta take your meds , you gotta eat ,
you gotta pace yourself ...
because i can &apos;t be your nurse .
i can &apos;t .
so walk your dog ...
or take a nap .
just , whatever you do ,
stop worrying .
okay , i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t have time for games .
i have to get back to the hospital .
she &apos;s right .
she does have to go back to the hospital .
we &apos;re not gonna talk about the hospital .
we &apos;re here to play baseball .
and drink beer . drink your beer .
drink a beer .
what more do you want in life ?
how can i drink beer
when all my friends just got fired ?
you know , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m leaving .
no . you need this . put this on . that &apos;s right .
trust me . there we go . look at this .
here . stand here . that &apos;s it .
no , i--no .
now hit the ball .
i don &apos;t want to hit the ball .
oh , my god !
here we go . here we go . strike one !
what , are you trying
you need to stop thinking about what &apos;s gonna happen ,
and you need to focus on what is right in front of you .
now hit the ball .
look at that .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
oh , my god . i hit it .
oh , my god . i hit it , mer ! wait , wait , my turn .
because the only cure for paranoia ...
you did it .
i hit it !

little grey . let &apos;s go .
is to be ...
that was fantastic .
