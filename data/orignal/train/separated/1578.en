That was Liam.
The foster brother you told me about?
He forced me to have sex with him.
You're so bossy sometimes.
It's kind of a turnoff.
Bossy?
Emma. Emma!
My girlfriend just broke up with me too.
Well, that was dumb of her.
Is Jesus home?
Um... no.
He isn't, I'm sorry.
Dear Callie, my name is Sophia.
And according to my dad, I'm your sister.
If you don't want me to meet Sophia, I won't.
If you want to, I think you should.
Can we hang out again? Like, soon?
Yeah, no, I'd like that.
When's the last time you spoke to Jude?
More specifically, when was the last time that he spoke to you?
Jude, talk to me.
Sorry!
No, it's fine.
I'm just glad you weren't doing what I thought you were doing.
What did you think I was...?
Ew! No, I... I don't do that.
Ok.
Morning.
Do you ever get overwhelmed
knowing that you have to brush your teeth every morning
and every night for the rest of your life?
Hey, listen, everyone. We spoke to Jude's therapist.
The good news is there's nothing physically wrong with him.
OK, so why isn't he talking?
We're not really sure,
but they think it's something called selective mutism.
It's a type of anxiety disorder.
So he's choosing not to talk?
It's not as simple as that.
It's, um, it's more like it's a coping mechanism.
So what are we supposed to do then?
We all have to be patient.
And do our best to keep his stress level down.
We're not gonna make a big deal out of his silence.
We're not gonna pressure him to talk.
And Jude'll keep seeing his therapist.
A lot of good that's gonna do, if he's not talking.
There are a lot of different ways to communicate, Callie.
Like Mama said, we'll just act like business as usual...
Hey, buddy. We, uh, just...
So, uh...
Oh, um, I'm probably gonna be late to dinner tonight.
We have extra practice all week.
I'll, uh, I'll get that. Just... you guys expecting somebody?
Well, I'm really proud of you, Mariana.
You've been working really hard.
Thanks. Apparently, I'm working a little too hard.
Kaitlyn says my smile is way too big,
and I look like I'm teaching Zumba to toddlers at the Y.
So I'm shooting more for a medium smile.
Is this a medium smile?
Sure.
Yeah, I guess so.
Callie.
There's someone at the door for you.
I know I should've texted or something,
but I couldn't wait to give you this, so...
Here.
You said you liked my jacket, so...
You didn't have to...
Oh, I know. I wanted to.
How did you even know where I live?
I saw your address on some of my dad's legal papers,
and I asked Marisol if we could drop by here on my way to school.
Who's Marisol?
My nanny.
And now I'm totally going to be late, so I gotta go.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course. It's beautiful. Thank you.
Because it's fine, you can totally return it if you want.
No. No, no. I... I love it.
Ok.
Marisol is literally going to kill me.
See you soon?
Yeah.
OK.
Jude.
You should have seen Sophia's face
when she dropped off that gift this morning.
She was so excited.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell her I can't see her anymore.
Hold up, hold up.
Why are you gonna do that? Because of Jude?
How do you even know that's what he wants?
Because I know my brother. And it's pretty obvious.
You two have been through a lot of bad stuff.
All right, you've been jerked around,
you've never known where you were gonna live or for how long.
Maybe not talking is his way of feeling like
he's finally in charge of something in his life. You know?
Or maybe I've just scarred him for life
and he'll never speak again.
Did, um... didn't Mariana tell you I came over last night?
You did?
I'm sure she just forgot.
Yeah, probably.
So...
Oh, it wasn't...
I just wanted to say, when we talked at practice...
I don't want you to think that I don't care.
I mean, I actually feel pretty awful
about how everything went down.
It was my fault. I never meant to hurt you.
I know. And I'm sorry.
I... I started feeling all weird and insecure.
I guess I just felt like that
you weren't really attracted to me.
That's not true at all.
But you're right, I'm bossy.
No, I shouldn't have said it like that.
You're strong and you know what you want and you ask for it.
That's not a turnoff. Not at all.
I was thinking,
maybe it was a mistake, breaking up.
Hey, Connor.
Hey. Can you talk for a minute?
Of course, have a seat.
Everything OK?
Um, no, not really.
I wanted to know, is there anything I can do to help Jude?
Besides making sure the other kids don't make fun of him.
Are they making fun of him?
Not in front of me.
Not anymore.
Well, thank you for that.
I appreciate you looking out for him, being such a good friend.
Did something happen?
My dad thinks Jude is gay.
That's why I can't spend the night at your house anymore.
I see.
Did he say that to Jude?
No. But I did.
You told Jude you thought he was gay?
No, I told him my dad did.
But I didn't stand up to him.
And I think that really hurt Jude's feelings.
I'm sorry.
I wish he'd talk to me again.
It's OK.
It's OK.
It's all right.
You're not your father.
Jude knows that.
And he's gonna speak to you again.
You know, I think we all just need to give him some space
to figure out all the stuff he's feeling inside.
So, it's not my fault?
No, sweetie. It's not.
Hey. Looking at your tax return?
Yeah. I wish.
So... how's the pregnancy going?
I remember the first trimester. Ugh! It can be a bear.
The nausea, the mood swings, the weight gain.
That was just me.
I see you still haven't taken off that baby weight yet.
Ha! Just kidding.
You're looking good, Mike. Looking good.
Thanks.
Actually, I owe it all to Dani.
She's got me doing yoga.
You? Really?
Yeah! Says it's good for stress relief.
I could use a little of that myself.
I'm about to have six children.
Oh, my God! What were we thinking?
Come on, Stef. Anybody can manage that, it's you.
You and Lena are unbelievable moms.
I'm really happy for you guys.
Thanks, Mike. Means a lot. It does.
You seeing Brandon tonight?
Yeah, Dani and I are gonna attempt to make empanadas.
So, um,
you might wanna save some leftovers for Brandon. Just in case.
I may be doing yoga now,
but I'm still not really an optimist. I'll see you later.
That Jane Doe in the morgue you been asking about?
Yeah.
They finally got a cause of death.
Blunt force trauma. They're ruling it a homicide.
You said you might know who she was?
Yeah.
You ever get those dental records you were waiting for?
No. Not yet.
Oh, OK.
Sure, it's no problem.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
OK, fine.
Yeah, we'll see you when you get here.
Bye.
Let me guess. He has to work late?
Yeah, he had a late arrest so he's got some paperwork to do.
I'm gonna go.
Why?
Dinner is ready, you should stay and eat.
If my dad's not coming, then there's no reason for me to stay.
You don't have to worry. It's not like something's gonna happen.
Yeah. I know.
So sit down and have dinner.
How can you do this?
Do what?
Move in with my dad,
sleep next to him every night knowing what we did.
I hate myself. I can barely look him in the eye.
First of all, your dad and I were broken up.
So that makes it OK then?
No.
But I didn't cheat on him.
I was drunk.
You used me. You wanted to hurt your dad
for all of the times he hurt you.
You didn't screw me that night, you screwed him.
You are so full of...
The truth?
You know it and so will he.
So before you consider unburdening yourself of all this guilt,
keep one thing in mind.
If your dad finds out,
I'm not the only one he'll never forgive.
I might have to figure out a way to live with myself,
but I sure as hell don't have to have dinner with you.
Why didn't you tell me Emma came by last night?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because you were upstairs
shoving your tongue down Hayley's throat?
I wasn't... She was... Look, this...
This thing with Hayley isn't serious.
You could have said no if you were still hung up on Emma.
Why do guys always act like
they don't have a choice if a girl wants to have sex?
We don't!
OK, that's just ridiculous.
Does Emma want to get back together?
Is that why she came over here?
Maybe.
So what did you say?
I told her we both need to take some time to think about it.
Is that code for you need some time to dump Hayley first?
Look, Hayley is, like, super sensitive.
She just had her heart broken, and she's my friend.
She's kind of my only friend on the dance team.
Look, I don't want to hurt anyone.
Well, then don't.
Be honest with them.
OK, I will.
OK, good.
As soon as I figure out what to say.
Hey, sweetie. Can I have a word with Jude?
Uh, yeah, sure.
You do your homework?
Can you turn that off for a minute?
So Connor came to see me today.
He told me what his dad said.
At first, I was... I was pretty angry at Connor's dad,
and I'm not gonna lie, I'm still kind of mad.
But, um, the truth is
there's nothing I can do about what he thinks.
The more I thought about it, though, um,
I really just kind of feel bad for Connor.
It must be hard...
...to grow up with all that judgment around.
I want you to know
that I'm so happy that you're our son.
And there is nothing that you can't tell us.
Even if it's something you think we don't want to hear.
Ok?
Ok.
So ten more minutes and then it's off to bed.
How were the empanadas?
Uh, what?
Your dad said he and Dani
were trying out some new recipe tonight.
Oh, yeah. Uh, Dad had to work late so I didn't stay for dinner.
Why didn't you stay and eat with Dani?
I hope you weren't rude. We raised you better than that.
Didn't we?
I wasn't rude. I just have a lot of homework.
I still do.
Ok.
I just, I want to get this project done.
Oh, uh, the band also has this place they rehearse sometimes,
I think it's called the Woodshed.
Anyway, they wanna take me after school tomorrow. That cool?
Yeah, as long as your homework's finished.
It's fine with me.
OK. You hang in there.
I cannot wait for the supposed burst of energy
that comes with the second trimester.
I was just reading that that's a thing.
Please tell me that's a thing.
That's a thing.
Look, I'm already showing.
Oh. Look at that.
What?
I'm afraid Mike might have had something to do
with Ana's disappearance.
What? Why would you even think that?
I spoke to a witness at the halfway house where she was staying,
and he said he saw Mike yelling at her the night she disappeared.
Stef, just because Mike fell off the wagon and yelled at her,
doesn't mean he hurt her.
I mean, she's a really easy person to yell at.
Hell, I've yelled at her sober.
I didn't tell you this, but when Dani found Mike,
he had blood on his hands. He said he'd been in a bar fight.
Well, look, you don't even know
if Ana's hurt or where she even is.
They, uh...
They found a Jane Doe
that sort of vaguely fits Ana's description,
but they can't make a positive ID.
So I tracked down her dental records,
but I have not turned them over to the coroner...
...because Jane Doe's death was ruled a homicide,
and if it is Ana, I could very well be linking Mike to a murder.
Oh, Stef, come on. I mean...
You know Mike. I know Mike.
I trust him implicitly. I trust him with our kids.
He's not capable of something like that.
Mike would do anything to defend his family.
She was threatening us, Lena, she was threatening all of us.
People... You never know what they're capable of doing,
trust me, especially given the right circumstances.
Well, honey, I think that...
...you have to turn over those records.
Either way, you need to know the truth.
How much further?
Well, it depends how far you wanna go.
Well, I thought we were going to, like, the Woodshed.
The Woodshed isn't really a place, it's more a...
I don't know, a state of mind.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's something jazz musicians used to do.
Get away from your life for a little while, mix things up,
get rid of distractions, really get into a piece of music.
I've never heard of that before.
Wait, did I just school Mr. Music on something?
Not bad for a high school dropout.
All right.
OK, so where do you wanna start?
Look at this view. You're missing it.
Yeah. It's nice. What are we thinking...?
I mean it! Seriously, quit trying to force it.
Can't we just be in the moment?
These might help.
Oh, no, thanks. I'm not really a brownie guy.
Uh, no, dude. These are special brownies.
It's up to you, man, but some of our best stuff
was written up here like this.
Come on, give "Brooding Brandon" a day off.
Yeah, to quote the great Bob Marley,
《Don't Worry, Be Happy》
Actually, it was Bobby McFerrin who wrote that song.
Yeah, Marley died in '81
and that song came out in the late '80s.
It was actually the first a cappella song
to reach number one on the charts,
which is pretty cool.
Dude, trust me. You need this.
Bad.
Hey. Hey, so, I...
I was just thinking about you.
Is there someplace you and I can go and talk?
Why? Are you breaking up with me?
No, no!
But, to be honest with you,
I didn't really think we were together, you know, officially.
Of course we were together.
I wasn't hooking up with anyone else.
Were you?
No.
I feel like you get me.
Even more than my friends.
Like, you see the real me.
I've been thinking...
I think we should tell people.
Do you think we can keep this on the DL just a little bit longer?
I don't wanna hurt Emma's feelings.
I mean, we just broke up.
I want give her some time to...
I thought she broke up with you.
It's complicated.
She kind of wants to get back together.
I just don't want her to feel any worse.
Is that cool?
OK.
Yeah, sure. I get it, no biggie.
We wait.
There's no me...
without you.
You're the glue...
in this zoo.
Be my boo.
Haters! This is supposed to be a safe space.
Ugh! I can't believe how messed up I feel.
That was hella strong.
Yeah, damn. Me, too.
How you holding up, Keys?
What?
How you holding up?
Here. Have some water.
Let's play a game.
I'll say a word and you say the first thing
that comes to your mind. OK?
OK.
Ocean.
Salt.
Sky.
Clouds.
Love.
Don't think about it. Love.
Lust.
Sex.
Guilt.
You associate love with lust,
but sex with guilt?
Interesting.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I just, I'll be right...
be back.
Maybe... maybe you should get ready for work.
I don't want you to be late.
I don't want to stop.
What about probation?
You know what you said about me and Jude
not having any control over our lives?
You're right.
I'm tired of it.
I get to control this.
I love you.
And this is what I want.
You ok, buddy?
下山了 正要回家 不
下山了 正要回家 不要担心 待会儿见
You ok?
I can't...
You don't have to...
Come here.
No, stop it! Stop!
What's wrong?
Sorry. I'm sorry. I can't do this.
Are you ok?
Not really. No.
I ate a pot brownie, and I'm freaking out.
Is that normal? I don't feel normal. I feel nervous.
Have you had pot before? I feel like you haven't, which is smart.
But, you know, you guys told us to, uh,
call if we ever need a ride home.
I shouldn't have called. I'm sorry.
No, Brandon, I'm glad you did.
It's ok.
Some people can get anxious or paranoid.
You never know how it's going to affect you.
It'll wear off, but until it does,
I'm here, ok? So just breathe.
We're gonna get you through this.
Ok. Thank you.
You don't have to thank me.
I'm your mom, this is what we do.
We made it official.
What?
We're a couple.
Jesus just wants to keep it under wraps for now
because he doesn't want to hurt Emma.
Guess she wants to get back together.
Spoiler alert: not gonna happen.
I think it's really sweet of him to worry about her feelings.
But people talk. The news is gonna get out.
I just, I think it would be better if she heard it from a friend.
Like who?
Like you.
Me?
You're friends, right?
Sort of. I mean, through Jesus.
I would tell her myself, but I barely know her,
so that would make me seem pretty awful.
OK, look.
I love my brother.
He's my twin and I would totally give him a kidney, anytime.
But when it comes to girls, he can be a little...
all over the place. Not in a bad way.
He's just not very good at expressing his true feelings.
If he even knows what he's feeling.
Which, most of the time, he doesn't.
He's easily confused.
Are you saying he doesn't like me?
No, he does. I think he does.
Then what are you trying to say?
Do you not want me to date your brother?
I thought we were friends.
We are!
And I am so stoked for you to date my brother.
I just... I don't want you to get hurt.
That's sweet.
But the person you should be worried about is Emma.
I mean, it's totally up to you if you want to tell her or not.
But I think it would be an awesome opportunity to do something nice.
Girls have to stand up for each other, right?
Did I do something wrong?
No. No.
Can you tell me what happened?
I don't know. I just...
No... I don't really want to talk about it.
It's OK if you're not ready. I'm not in any hurry.
No, I know.
Thank you.
I'm late.
Callie, please look at me.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Everything is fine.
I really don't know his schedule,
since we're not partners anymore.
But you can find out, right,
if he's working a double? It can't be that hard.
What's this about, Dani?
He canceled dinner last night with Brandon.
He wouldn't normally do that.
It's a dinner...
It's not just a dinner. He leaves early, he comes home late.
I don't know what to think.
Unless...
Unless he's drinking again?
I haven't smelled anything on him,
but I don't know, maybe he's getting high some other way.
What, Mike? Drugs? No. That's...
Maybe he's just having an affair.
He's not a cheater, Dani.
I don't know what to tell you.
I hope you're right.
But if he is using or drinking again,
it's something we're all going to have to deal with.
So if you won't check up on him for me, do it for Brandon.
Hey, did you... did those records go over to the coroner yet?
Oh, yeah. The guy just left. Why?
Nothing. Never mind. Thank you.
Once I got to Paris,
I just knew I was going to be a different person
for the rest of my life.
The things that we do, the choices we make,
they change us, you know?
Yeah. That's so cool.
It's like you're cars on a train.
Well, not on a train, cars of a train.
They're all... they're all in the right order
and they're all just going down the track,
you gotta get them into the right station. You know?
Sure.
Unless you pull into the wrong station,
and then everything's just screwed up forever
because now you're in Moscow and you wanna be in St. Petersburg,
and nobody wants to be in Moscow,
unless you're, like, Raskolnikov,
and you're trying to escape the anguish of what you did.
Maybe we shouldn't talk about Crime and Punishment right now.
It's a little heavy.
But not. You know?
I do.
Girl, what'd that table ever do to you?
Callie.
Girl, where you at?
Sorry.
Sit and spill.
You and Wyatt get in a fight?
No. Not at all.
Though he might think so.
Why?
I was gonna have sex with Wyatt today for the first time.
I know it's a parole violation,
but they can't tell me what to do with my own body.
I agree.
Then why the face?
I'm just surprised.
Because of Brandon?
No, I just figured you and Wyatt were already doing it.
Oh. Uh, no.
No, and we didn't today either.
'Cause I kind of freaked out.
Why?
I don't know.
All of a sudden, I... I couldn't breathe.
And I felt like he was
gonna crush me or something.
Maybe you were just nervous.
Or maybe I'm still in love with Brandon.
I thought you were over him.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But maybe I'm not.
I never felt like that when we were together.
Were you ever with Brandon?
No.
No, not like that.
Don't give up on Wyatt.
He's a good one.
I'm not. I'm not.
We should get back to work.
Mm-hm.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You all right?
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.
I just, I thought I saw someone I know.
Brandon, why did you call me?
I mean, I'm glad that you did.
But, you know, you have other options.
Well, Jude and the twins can't drive. So...
Neither can Callie, come to think of it.
And, I don't know, um...
Mom tends to overreact to things, and...
I was just feeling so anxious, I couldn't imagine
dealing with her yelling, on top of it all.
She only yells at you because she loves you so much.
I know.
We both do. Unconditionally.
Honey, it's OK. You made a mistake.
Tomorrow everything's gonna be back to normal.
No, things will... never be normal again.
This is just part of growing up.
It's OK.
No. It's not.
I slept with Dani.
Dani?
Hey. Heading out?
I thought you were still pulling doubles.
Luckily, no. I did my time.
Good for you.
I gotta run.
I don't want to risk the wrath of Dani by being late for date night.
I hear you. I'm heading out, too. Have a good night.
Bye.
You told Emma about Hayley?
You're welcome.
What, you think you were doing me a favor?
Yes.
Emma's really upset. Why would you want to hurt her like that?
Why would you?
Why would you tell Hayley you were a couple, and not tell Emma?
So you could string her along in case you change your mind again?
It's none of your business.
And whether you like it or not,
your behavior, especially when it comes to girls on the dance team,
affects me.
You wanna protect your little spot on the dance team?
News flash: you're a terrible dancer.
Well, you're a terrible brother and an even worse boyfriend.
You broke Lexi's heart, and now Emma's,
and I'm pretty sure Hayley is next in line.
So, you know what?
I'm taking a stand for womankind. Deal with it.
Don't get all high and mighty.
This isn't about you taking a stand.
This is about you trying to be like all those other girls.
That's not true.
Oh, please,
have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?
If you wanna be a giant pain in my ass,
at least admit why you're doing it.
'Cause you wanna fit in. 'Cause you're a sheep!
What was all that slamming?
Your brother and sister.
I feel a lot better.
I'm glad.
You can't tell anyone what happened with Dani.
You have to promise me.
What Dani did to you is not right.
It's illegal. And I can't...
Listen to me.
Mom will kill her.
And Dad might start drinking again,
or who knows?
Please, don't tell anyone.
You can't ask me to do that.
Please!
They'll never look at me the same way again.
Can I join you?
Remember when we lived with that really mean kid
with the weird eyebrow, and he challenged us to play?
We lost so bad.
And the next time we played,
you figured out that thing, that thing at the end.You know?
His character stopped fighting and did that, like, crazy dance.
It was hilarious.
We're a good team.
You're clearly the brains of the operation.
