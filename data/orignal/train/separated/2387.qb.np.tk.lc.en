does elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar ?
i love you . now look me in the eye and tell me
that you don &apos;t feel something for him .
i would know if i were killing people .
you wear a ring that lets you cheat death , ric .
how many times can you die before it changes you ?
you have a weapon that can kill klaus ?
nope . we all have a weapon .
let &apos;s go kill some originals .
when an original dies ,
every vampire turned in their bloodline dies along with them .
bring us the stakes ...
or i &apos;ll wage a war against everyone you love .
where the hell is it ?
i put it right here !
a stake doesn &apos;t just vanish into thin air !
are you telling me
that your vampire hating alter ego has a stake
that could kill an entire line of vampires , possibly mine ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m telling you .
alaric ?
yeah ?
still me .
you know you shouldn &apos;t be in here .
defeats the point of the whole being locked in a cellar thing .
well , you still need the basics .
toothbrush , clothes , some boring books to help you sleep .
&quot; doctor jekyll and mr. hyde &quot; ?
what ?
no , i got--
damon . thinks he &apos;s hilarious .
at least one of us still has a sense of humor .
are you sure that you--i mean ,
you don &apos;t have to be kept in here .
oh , no , this is ...
ah , this is the right place for me to be .
at least until you guys can
convince my highly uncooperative alter ego to &apos; fess up to where i--
or ... he hid the white oak stake .
we looked everywhere .
you ... the other you hid it well .
what &apos;s klaus going to do if you can &apos;t find it ?
it &apos;s the only thing that will kill him , so ...
wage war . murder people .
you know , klaus stuff .
listen ...
stefan is going to watch over you for a little while .
now that klaus knows where jeremy is ,
it &apos;s not safe . so ...
damon and i are going to go to denver to pick him up .
why do you say that like you &apos;re waiting for me to disapprove ?
i don &apos;t know .
me and damon ,
traveling across the country .
well , i guess i &apos;m more curious
to hear what stefan has to say about it .
actually , it was his idea .
he thinks that i have some unresolved feelings for damon .
do you ?
i guess that &apos;s why i &apos;m going on this trip .
so i can figure it out .
did you hear from klaus ?
not yet . i &apos;m sure i will soon , though .
he &apos;s expecting me to deliver two stakes .
i only have one .
well , that &apos;s going to be disappointing for him .
i &apos;ll get it out of alaric . i just need some time .
i like that confidence , stefan .
i don &apos;t share it , but i like it .
you don &apos;t think i can do what it takes ?
well , you &apos;re good stefan again . you &apos;re in control .
sorry , you might get the girl but you lose the edge .
speaking of ...
have you ever flown first class ?
who did you have to compel for that ?
please . i used miles .
stefan ...
be safe .
what is this ?
it &apos;s the decade dance .
remember , you made us sign up to help .
no .
this ! the twenties .
we &apos;re doing the seventies .
it &apos;s too flashy , people .
it &apos;s supposed to be a speakeasy , not the world &apos;s fair .
oh , good , you &apos;re here . we need help setting up the tables ,
so get to it .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
somebody has to be in charge .
yeah , me . i &apos;m the chair of the dance committee .
the theme of the decade dance is the 1970s .
so you &apos;d rather dress in tacky colors with bad hair
than be a classic flapper from the jazz age .
honestly , i don &apos;t know what my brother sees in you .
well , maybe he sees a challenge .
see , unlike some other people ,
i don &apos;t sleep with everyone i make eye contact with .
maybe we can do both decades .
no .
go on , matt , don &apos;t be a coward .
you know you loved my twenties idea when i presented it to the group .
traitor !
bell bottoms and disco ?
i don &apos;t know , this just seemed cooler .
see , it &apos;s just cooler .
whatever . have fun at your stupid dance .
caroline !
wait !
impressive .
you sold it .
and you bought yourself a day .
thank you . just ... keep her occupied .
be careful .
you , too .
and , uh ...
tell him i said hi , ok ?
do you know how hard it is to fall asleep
when that &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to do ?
well , look , i know it &apos;s not easy ,
so ... damon suggested i bring something to--
help speed up the process .
what the hell .
you know , i &apos;ll feel decidedly less pathetic
if i don &apos;t drink alone .
oh , i &apos;m , uh , one step ahead of you .
so ... ahem .
road trip , huh ?
yeah , yeah , i needed to stay here .
why ?
i mean , why you ?
you know , it doesn &apos;t take much to baby @-@ sit me
while i sit here waiting for a psychotic break .
well , unfortunately , we only have
a limited amount of time .
before what ?
before we have to resort to other methods .
so you &apos;re worried you &apos;re going to have to torture it out of me .
and you don &apos;t think damon could have done that ?
look , elena needed to go on that road trip with damon .
no matter what i go through ...
to get her back--
fighting my blood lust ,
trying to gain control of my life again ...
none of that matters if she has feelings for somebody else .
there he is .
next time we compel him ,
remind me to make him better at baseball .
hey , jer .
elena ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
katherine sired us , rose sired katherine ,
all we need to do is find out who sired rose .
so you traveled across the country
to get me to talk to a dead vampire ?
dead vampire &apos;s redundant but yes .
well , i can &apos;t .
i can talk to anna and vicki because i knew them .
i &apos;ve never even met rose .
what good is you dying and coming back to life
if you can &apos;t talk to a ghost when i need you to ?
rose spent a long time running from klaus as well .
she and damon were close ,
so maybe we can use you as a connection .
fine , fine . can we do this later ?
my friend just got here .
and yes , damon , i actually have some .
i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m done .
jer ...
hey , man .
damon , it &apos;s kol !
what the hell are you doing ? !
jeremy , get back , he &apos;s an original !
what ? !
no hard feelings , mate , but we &apos;re not buds .
you know , i &apos;ll never get used to aluminum .
but , hey , at least it won &apos;t break .
did you kill him ?
no , but it &apos;ll give us a head start . come on .
come on .
for the record , she &apos;s the one who wanted to stop in a motel , not me .
so where are we ?
corner of somewhere and nowhere where kol can &apos;t find us .
i can &apos;t believe kol was a vampire .
well , didn &apos;t you find it weird that you made a friend so fast ?
have you met you ?
not helping .
this should work . right , jer ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t really matter .
all right , whoopi .
what do you need , candles , incense , pottery wheel ?
that &apos;s not how it works .
i know , i know . they push from the other side
and you pull from this one .
all right , you , uh , you got a picture of her ?
picture ? from what , our trip to disneyland ?
come on , rose , you &apos;re not going to actually make us wait , are you ?
i know you &apos;re obsessed with me .
all right , uh ,
tell me something about her .
um , well ,
she did this little thing with her tongue .
something that matters , damon .
she spent her last day in paradise .
soaking in the sun and
reminiscing about what it means to be human .
and when death came ,
she didn &apos;t fear it .
i was with her on her last day ,
and she definitely wasn &apos;t in paradise .
it was in the dream he gave her .
she &apos;s here .
you have no idea how much i &apos;ve missed you .
here we are . home sweet home .
ok , spill . why are you being nice to me ?
i drove you home . you don &apos;t have a car .
not just that . i mean ... helping me with the dance
and standing up to caroline .
i don &apos;t buy it .
buy what ?
the whole gentlemanly thing .
after everything my family &apos;s done to you .
what are you up to ?
it &apos;s sad that you can &apos;t just get a ride home from school
without thinking there &apos;s some ulterior motive .
you &apos;re right .
but i &apos;m probably going to organize the whole dance
and then have to compel myself a date .
let &apos;s not get crazy .
good @-@ bye , rebekah .
good @-@ bye , matt .
thanks for the ride home .
mother ...
give me one good reason why i shouldn &apos;t kill you right now .
because i &apos;m dying .
is she lonely on the other side ?
no . i enjoy it .
i was running so much when i was alive .
now i have the freedom to do whatever i want .
she says not to worry , she &apos;s happy .
is she still hot ?
tell him he &apos;s still dripping with sex , too .
fine . tell him i miss him .
she misses you .
and tell him that i &apos;m rooting for him and elena .
she , uh , she misses both of you .
unfortunately i don &apos;t have any news on the siring front .
klaus didn &apos;t sire me . no original did .
it was mary porter .
she was sired by someone named mary porter .
ahh , scary mary .
well , where is she , rose ?
i didn &apos;t keep track of her when i was alive , much less now .
tell them to sit tight . relax .
i &apos;ll see what i can find out .
you think they got jeremy by now ?
they should .
i haven &apos;t heard from them .
elena &apos;s worried about him .
now that she can &apos;t count on his ring anymore .
who knows . maybe his alter ego &apos;s a pot @-@ smoking , hippie pacifist .
yeah , maybe .
i can &apos;t say
i thought mine would be so hostile and militant .
actually , it makes perfect sense .
your wife left you to become a vampire
and your girlfriend was killed by one .
he must really hate me .
here i am ,
the failed hunter @-@ slash- drinking buddy
of vampires .
ah . he &apos;s too judgmental .
the thing is ...
he &apos;s me .
i &apos;m not compelled , i &apos;m not possessed .
there &apos;s no humanity switch .
what drives him ...
is me .
no .
no , he &apos;s not you .
he &apos;s the darkest parts of you .
parts we all have .
well , this is depressing , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , and i found this upstairs .
now by my count , there should be one more .
yeah , well , it &apos;s going to take a little more time .
why , because we &apos;re waiting for that one to pass out ?
no , thanks . i think i &apos;ll just kill him .
well , then you won &apos;t know the location of the other stake .
i can live with that .
well , i can &apos;t .
when we staked finn ,
we discovered that killing an original vampire
killed its entire bloodline .
now , i don &apos;t know which one of you
i &apos;m descended from ,
but i &apos;d really rather not find out by dying ,
so why don &apos;t we just find the stake , destroy it
so we can all be safe ?
so the fate of the entire vampire race
depends on you finding the stake .
and to get it , we need you to pass out .
which means that i feel totally justified doing this .
there .
sleeping like a baby .
there you are .
any sign of evilaric ?
nope . only dead alaric .
what ?
don &apos;t worry , he was wearing his ring .
klaus was here . let &apos;s just say he &apos;s not very patient .
kol must have told him we were in denver .
how long has ric been out ?
a few hours . i &apos;m hoping when he wakes up ,
it won &apos;t be him . it &apos;ll be the other him .
and if not ?
yeah , i know .
whatever it takes .
so were you able to contact rose ?
yeah . no answers yet .
so we &apos;re just stuck in this motel until she gets back to us .
motel ?
yeah , we had to get away from kol .
i &apos;ll call you when i know more .
so what &apos;s up with you and damon ?
what do you mean ? nothing &apos;s up .
you sure about that ?
&apos;cause even rose said something .
what--what did she say ?
everything ok in here ?
yeah . it &apos;s fine .
ok . well ,
i &apos;m going to freshen up .
you might want to get some rest .
i &apos;m sure rose will make herself known when she gets back .
how are you dying ?
i thought ayana had preserved your body with a spell .
she did . i &apos;m drawing my power from the bennett witch line .
when abby died , the connection was severed .
so my body is weakened .
well , if you &apos;ve come to spend your last moments
with your loving daughter , prepare to be disappointed .
you should have spent last time plotting my death .
is that what you think i &apos;ve been doing on the other side ?
i &apos;ve been looking over you for a thousand years
of joy and heartbreak .
your fights with klaus .
the nights you cried yourself to sleep calling out my name .
not a day has gone by
that i wasn &apos;t right there with you .
and yet you still tried to kill me .
because it shouldn &apos;t have been a thousand years , rebekah .
no one should live that long .
but i haven &apos;t lived at all .
sorry , rebekah .
so , so sorry .
what &apos;s going on ?
she &apos;s dead .
did i mention i miss you ?
bad .
at some point , we are going to do this
on an actual bed , right ?
yes . i promise .
once i figure out how to deal with klaus .
tell him to suck it .
broke his sire bond .
and you won &apos;t have to deal with him anymore .
it &apos;s easier said than done .
besides , i won &apos;t know if it &apos;s broken for sure until i test it .
wait , i thought that &apos;s why you were coming back .
because you said you felt different .
i do feel different .
i feel freer .
way more myself .
all i know is , i just turned about a hundred times
in the appalachian mountains .
if i can get through that , i can get through anything .
good .
because klaus might not be our only problem .
why ?
what else i miss ?
matt killed an original .
and then , every vampire that original had ever turned
mysteriously died .
right now damon is desperate to figure out
which original created our vampire blood line .
and ... if he finds out it wasn &apos;t klaus ,
they &apos;re all going to kill him .
but klaus turned me .
so if he dies ... i die .
i know that .
they know that .
difference is ...
damon doesn &apos;t care .
you never told me about that .
what you did for rose .
it wasn &apos;t about you .
why you don &apos;t let people see the good in you ?
because when people see good ,
they expect good .
and i don &apos;t want to have to live up
to anyone &apos;s expectations .
don &apos;t .
why not , elena ?
elena ?
oh , my god . jeremy .
rose found mary . she lives in kansas .
ok , then .
let &apos;s go .
welcome back .
what happened ?
did i , uh ... no .
no , you pretty much , uh ,
laid there dead for half the night .
but on the , uh , on the plus side ...
i did almost finish reading &quot; moby dick . &quot;
this is stupid .
evil me , or whatever you want to call him ,
he &apos;s not going to make an appearance .
why would he ?
i mean , the best hiding place is the one
where you can &apos;t find the person who hid it .
i know .
so how do you want to do this ?
i don &apos;t want to do any of this .
well , that makes two of us .
but i don &apos;t think we have much choice in the matter .
wait a minute , what are you doing ?
you need that ring .
no , what i need is hope
that my alter ego doesn &apos;t have a death wish .
so i &apos;m taking bets
that my dark side has a sense of self @-@ preservation .
so let &apos;s see if he defends himself against death .
look , alaric ,
i &apos;m not going to kill you , ok ?
if we have any chance at this , stefan ,
you &apos;re going to have to try .
this is the address .
looks about right .
wait here .
why ? so you guys can make out some more ?
don &apos;t be a dick .
listen to your sister .
thank you .
come on .
like &quot; vampire hoarders . &quot;
who is this mary person ?
scary mary . really old ,
super creepy .
and how do you know her ?
you know .
of course .
what ? i said creepy ,
not ugly .
mary ...
quite contrary .
you &apos;re not putting enough into this .
any more into it ,
i &apos;m going to break your spine .
well , don &apos;t back down now .
oh , no , no , no , no . i can &apos;t .
the blood .
oh , come on , you &apos;re past that .
no , i &apos;m not .
then use it .
give into it .
try to kill me , stefan , come on .
not like this , alaric .
yes !
like this .
you &apos;re going to have to want to kill me
for me to believe that you will .
i go this far , i may not be able to stop .
you want the answers from my darkest side ,
you &apos;re going to have to tap into yours .
so don &apos;t back down .
don &apos;t fight it . just do it .
do it !
you &apos;re so weak .
look at you .
one of nature &apos;s most hideous creatures ,
and you can &apos;t even get that right .
you ...
me .
shame about mary . she used to be a blast .
i don &apos;t quite know what happened .
i fear all the time she
spent with my family might have ruined her .
she was a bit of an original groupie .
and were you her favorite ?
you mean , did i turn her .
i think i did .
but , no , wait . maybe it was rebekah .
but there was also a klaus period .
and let &apos;s not forget the elijah affair .
i spoke to my brother . i know you &apos;re trying
to find out who you descended from .
now you never will .
so ...
where did we leave off ?
elena , get out of here !
according to my brother , you &apos;re off @-@ limits .
just don &apos;t test me .
don &apos;t touch her .
oh , dear .
i &apos;ve hit the nerve .
relax , darling .
i just want us to be even .
you snapped my neck , you killed my brother ,
and then you humiliated me .
there .
now we &apos;re even .
where &apos;s the stake ?
you &apos;re worse than i ever was .
spineless . pathetic .
tell me where the stake is before i kill you .
you know , you &apos;re all going to burn .
ashes to dust .
where &apos;s the stake ? !
i &apos;m going to kill you in 3 ...
2 ... 1 .
it &apos;s in the cave .
where no vampire can get it .
that wasn &apos;t too hard , was it ?
are you ok ?
ah . yeah .
that &apos;s better .
are you ok ? you &apos;re bleeding .
yeah . i &apos;ll be fine .
good .
what are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
well , going on this trip and kissing me ...
what the hell is this ?
stefan thinks that i have feelings for you .
do you ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know .
i guess you thought this little
trip could help you figure that out , didn &apos;t you ?
no . or maybe you &apos;re hoping i &apos;ll screw it up
so i can just make the decision for you , am i wrong ?
damon ...
am i wrong ?
it &apos;s what you do , damon !
you sabotage things . you--
i mean , think about it . every time that
there &apos;s a bump in the road , you lash out .
but what if i didn &apos;t ?
what if there was no bump ?
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
but this time i &apos;m not going to make it so easy for you .
this time you &apos;ll have to figure it out for yourself .
it &apos;s a little gratuitous ,
don &apos;t you think , stefan ? i would have been more gentle .
i &apos;m going to take him to the caves .
you &apos;re going to go inside and fetch me the stake .
and if you think you can hide , you &apos;re wrong .
and then there was one .
i know about your brother &apos;s little mission to denver .
he failed .
not that that &apos;s news anymore .
so what are you going to do now , klaus ?
are you going to kill me ?
i haven &apos;t actually decided yet .
oh , sure you have .
see , you &apos;ve had every chance
and every excuse imaginable to do it , but yet you haven &apos;t .
which means you don &apos;t want to .
you know something , you &apos;re right .
see , i &apos;m still waiting for my old friend to come back .
by the looks of it , he &apos;s just beneath the surface .
waiting to come out and play .
right , ripper ?
i &apos;ve been fighting that part of myself .
thinking that if i repress it , it would go away .
but it won &apos;t .
and now that i &apos;ve accepted it ,
it can &apos;t control me .
and neither can you .
so ...
unless you &apos;re going to stake me .
why don &apos;t you get the hell out of my house .
are we there yet ?
don &apos;t tell them i &apos;m here .
they had a fight .
i know you want to stop it .
protect her from it .
but you &apos;re young . you don &apos;t see what i see .
it &apos;s not just that she makes him a better person .
she does , but ... he changes her , too .
damon challenges her .
surprises her .
he makes her question her life .
beliefs .
stefan is different .
his love is pure .
and he &apos;ll always be good for her .
damon is either the best thing for her ,
or the worst .
my mom said you can stay as long as you want .
did she say we could share the bed ?
no . she said you can sleep on the couch .
at least until we figure out
what damon and stefan find out about klaus .
and if klaus didn &apos;t create their line ?
and they try to kill him ?
tyler ... i just got you back .
i &apos;m not losing you again .
klaus drew this for you ?
huh ?
that &apos;s ... pretty creepy .
yeah .
klaus is pretty creepy .
even when he &apos;s trying to be charming .
charming ?
does klaus have a thing for you or something ?
no ! as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
he isn &apos;t capable of real feelings .
i &apos;m serious .
what the hell happened while i was gone ?
tyler . nothing .
ok , nothing happened .
then why &apos;d you keep this ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think i &apos;m going to find some place else to spend the night .
tyler ...
tyler !
go get it .
you know i can &apos;t get in .
why would i give you
the one thing that requires everyone to keep me alive ?
are we bargaining now ?
fine .
what &apos;s your offer ?
there &apos;s only one stake out there .
which means only one original has to die .
help me .
and i &apos;ll make sure it &apos;s not you .
tenuous , but points for effort .
you see , i don &apos;t want one original to die .
i want them all to die .
how the hell did you do that ?
it was easy to fool niklaus ,
but i thought you , of all people , would understand .
after all , my son did use your body at one point .
you &apos;re not rebekah .
no .
my name is esther .
