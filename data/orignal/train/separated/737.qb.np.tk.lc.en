letting it out is better
... than having to tell the cops you didn &apos;t mean to hug her to death .
well , that &apos;s why you take it beforehand ,
... so you don &apos;t get sick . it &apos;s prophylactic .
he &apos;s neck @-@ deep in fraud and if anything goes down ,
... they &apos;ll come after you first !
the money you stole from servicecircuit ?
i don &apos;t know anything about that .
because if you did empty those accounts ,
... you &apos;re the one going down , not me .
more like the toilet . but the potential &apos;s there ... we could make it work .
so is everybody like hot @-@ hot phil in your family ,
... or are most of them like you ?
but you need to lay off that until your cholesterol &apos;s down . why not turkey ?
firing you is the least of it .
the only reason you &apos;re not going to prison ...
he said there &apos;s something nasty going around , and you should take one , too .
it can &apos;t be the sex ... you were a lot nicer and your hair was more shiny .
i &apos;ll take a stab and say it &apos;s because you realized feng shui is bullshit .
these nipples look like they &apos;ve done hard time in africa feeding a village .
i am not sleeping with him ! and the fact you think i would , really hurts !
but what about the people who try to work it out ? maybe that &apos;s an option .
hacked into his computer the night she was supposed to have sex with him .
instead , he &apos;s totally fine and i &apos;m sitting here with the two of you ...
i &apos;m a 34 @-@ inch waist . the fit doesn &apos;t have to be perfect . i like blue .
so you made a straitjacket and a pillow fort to protect yourself from me .
is that he should be the one freaking out , not me . i didn &apos;t do anything .
which is fitting , as obviously i don &apos;t know anything going on in his life .
you girls think you can shake me down for all my money , you &apos;re crazy .
you won &apos;t lose your shit like you did with me . don &apos;t say you didn &apos;t .
so what ? maybe you just have to forgive people in order to move forward .
that &apos;s a $ 300,000 car , asshole !
i guess you can afford it , then .
and you know what ? it &apos;s about to happen again , so if you don &apos;t mind ...
he &apos;s always going to wind up on top because he &apos;s a killer and i &apos;m not .
who cares ? where else has he traveled ? please don &apos;t tell me thailand .
you must hate me so much . if it &apos;s any consolation , i hate me more .
and to relieve the pressure , they had to cut out a chunk of his skull .
we were going to hold off for prom , but we just got carried away .
if he &apos;s not seeing you ... i &apos;m so sorry i said that , that sucks ...
i &apos;m saying everything fails eventually and monogamy is not natural .
i quit my job so we could focus on his job . i put off having kids ...
i found this ... wire transfer instructions for a company in the bahamas .
no . i said it was next week last week , which means it &apos;s this week .
because now sex is off the table ... we have to speak to one another ,
try living under the same roof with him . all i get is surprise penis .
he &apos;s stealing , kate . making money for them is the way he does it .
i know mark is at the one and only .
perfect , we &apos;re halfway there !
no jinxies . i get it . it &apos;s good that mark doesn &apos;t have a nickname .
no . when you have a body like that , everything fits you perfectly .
that can &apos;t be right . mark was talking about servicecircuit last night .
he used you to create the company and put everything in your name .
were for servicecircuit . guess whose signature is all over them ?
i did , because i was a mistress @-@ virgin and you were the first .
no , no , no . we are not hiring a hooker to sleep with my husband .
yeah , i remember . sorry about your urn . what are you doing here ?
oh , please ! every relationship i &apos;ve ever had , something felt off .
look what i found . this is a list of all the start @-@ up companies ...
this is cece . kate &apos;s the one who had the idea for swipeswitch.com.
it &apos;s bullshit . it &apos;s bullshit ! global bullshit ! i call bullshit !
what if the top part of me hated him , while the bottom part of me ...
it &apos;s not always a wreck . stan and i were married when we met .
what if he &apos;s calling to say he loves you and wants to be with you ?
it &apos;s okay . the wine hit me wrong ... i have a splitting headache .
but if we want it on video , i need a different court reporter .
he &apos;s not a donor kidney .
it &apos;s not the organ i was thinking of .
uh , i couldn &apos;t read the menu because i left my glasses at nina &apos;s .
you know when you just feel like , &quot; normal clothes are blah ... &quot;
okay , great , come on . let &apos;s get in the car . come on , come on .
we think mark has another mistress ... we &apos;re going to find her .
if you had something to lose , you &apos;d understand how hard this is .
have you packed ? i want to get on the road before traffic starts .
call me when you &apos;re done being pissed .
that might be a while .
not all . just half . that &apos;s what equal partners get ... 50 % .
what ? from her ? ! is this some kind of joke ? you &apos;re firing me ?
i am not a mistress . a mistress knows she &apos;s dating a married man .
what do you want me to say ? i get more ass than a toilet seat !
you sure the window doesn &apos;t open ?
no . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
i would expect that from other guys in their offices , but not you .
and that i care about your problems ... but guess what ? i don &apos;t .
things shifted this weekend . it was different . you don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s your evil genius smile . is somebody about to get screwed ?
mark &apos;s invested in . three are offshore and one &apos;s a blind filing .
and she does nothing . just lays around the house all day long .
i don &apos;t care about you or mark or your marriage or your dog .
and no matter how many women you sleep with , or cars you buy ...
if you &apos;re having a panic attack , go outside and get some air .
what is this ? why does it say zero ? why &apos;s that even on here ?
it &apos;s over . i &apos;m getting my ideas direct from the factory now .
don &apos;t you have a job ? ! or hobbies ? ! what is wrong with you ? !
this is a ... one @-@ day @-@ at @-@ a @-@ time operation . today is light recon day .
it &apos;s boring stuff from the accountant . servicecircuit again .
and i feel like an idiot for trusting you over him . i am done !
but sadly , i had to empty those accounts , so you &apos;re broke .
no , i &apos;m not jealous . i just don &apos;t have an insane girl crush .
but if you can &apos;t , i suggest you get a game plan and leave .
if you can live with that , like the french , then stay put .
micromacks ? i thought dave cohen was handling this merger .
this window . just open it a little . crack it . just crack it .
i have soft hands and a small mouth . i will be the bottom !
she &apos;s kind of troubled . but you smell amazing . what is that ?
did all the dirty work ? what if he just put it in halfway ...
put on something sexy , get your ass out to connecticut ...
we &apos;ll have the whole weekend in the hamptons to work that out .
when you &apos;re divvying up friends in the divorce , keep this one .
you told me you &apos;d get a divorce and we &apos;d move to tuscany .
you &apos;re so amazing , to be friends with your husband &apos;s mistress .
i don &apos;t think we should rush into anything . what are you doing ?
every time i look through binoculars , he has another mistress .
but i didn &apos;t want to show up empty @-@ handed , so i brought food .
no , you were right about everything . and he &apos;s still lying to me .
i can &apos;t . if i &apos;m investigating him or i go to the bahamas ...
nothing . i just think it &apos;s more complicated than we thought .
like a triangle of his skull , they cut it right out of his head ...
in connecticut . &quot; with the canadian crew . &quot; which is code .
you &apos;ll take it off and it &apos;ll just be something you used to wear .
i don &apos;t want to make license plates !
you won &apos;t go to jail .
i don &apos;t call a boyfriend back after i find out he has a wife .
did you know she was his mistress when she was in the house ?
she &apos;s doing all of the stuff , the feng shui ... in the house .
we &apos;re out of air . it &apos;s hot in here . just crack the window .
to confirm that you and he were still on for drinks with &quot; mark . &quot;
it &apos;s completely crazy , and i don &apos;t know where it &apos;s going ...
i thought i would come here and you would tell me i was crazy .
don &apos;t come at me with all your ... weird little man logic , ok ?
right . see ? see ? that &apos;s why i need to go to brain camp .
first , one was mine , so that doesn &apos;t count . second of all .
we thought you might say that . then carly explained ...
i was going crazy without you . i &apos;m sorry for being a jerk .
you can &apos;t . there &apos;s too much morning sun . it would blast you .
i still think i &apos;m not ready to compete with women like you .
i told you that before you married him . what a piece of shit !
about it , i &apos;m going to go crazy ... for real . like , really .
wait ! what am i supposed to do ? you can &apos;t just leave me .
you wouldn &apos;t get dressed , so i buttoned you in backwards .
think of it as payback . that &apos;s how we framed it with nick .
and if i was ray charles , i would actually be blind and ...
oh , my god , i am so sorry . i can &apos;t believe i said that .
you made us a ton of money this year . nobody bats a thousand .
it &apos;s like his sex drive is tripled .
non @-@ stop , right ?
so , what &apos;s up ? what &apos;s this big mystery you want me to solve ?
i went to china ! do you have any idea how far away china is ?
yes . we &apos;re celebrating . just let me clean up real quick .
a pipe burst in his house and he went back to connecticut .
it &apos;s already hooked .
come on . it &apos;s barely in the red !
i just want to talk . i thought we could have some dinner ?
why is he calling you at all ?
i don &apos;t know that , either .
i &apos;ll tell you what my mother told me ... words to live by .
and then i took a really hot bath after and really cleaned up ?
why can &apos;t he stuff it into a tube sock like a normal guy ?
she &apos;s 24 , a dance major . i eat anything she tells me to .
it must be big . you were crazy about him two days ago .
but if i play against john mcenroe , i expect to lose .
i &apos;ll tell what you do ... look for blind offshore filings .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you anything you want if you just leave .
fine . rock , paper , scissors . winner has sex with my husband .
well , well . look who &apos;s here ... the wife and the mistress .
you have the perfect place , and you are the perfect girl ...
get dave on the phone . i need all pertinent materials ...
you &apos;re overreacting .
they &apos;re straight out of the congo !
what &apos;s this guy do ?
he develops start @-@ up companies .
whatever happens between you and mark is your business .
and every time i flushed the toilet , the shower got cold ?
you wanted to be friends , too . you just didn &apos;t know it .
the girl at the shop told me that sheer is the next big thing .
no . and i feel like if amber won &apos;t talk to me , then ...
i don &apos;t even know if she &apos;s american . i don &apos;t even know .
if you &apos;re going to cave every time he pays attention to you ...
it just seems like everything was so simple then . you know ?
i &apos;m the ceo . i &apos;m the ceo of several companies , actually .
that wasn &apos;t a shitty apartment . that was a great apartment .
i &apos;ve been dating for decades ! i don &apos;t need this anymore !
didn &apos;t you notice our skin ? that nice bahamian glow ?
listen , mark &apos;s shady . he finds out you have a lawyer ,
what are you doing ?
seeing if mark wants to hang out .
and though mark &apos;s an asshole , they had something real .
and if you work it out , he &apos;s just going to do it again .
so let me get this straight . i came into your bed naked ...
because you know how i get carried away with all the colors ...
i can &apos;t join a gang ! i don &apos;t know how to make shanks !
my situation &apos;s pretty situated at all times , it &apos;s true .
you &apos;re being a very negative detective . give me a boost up .
you are innocent in all this . let &apos;s go back to phil &apos;s .
you deserve something different , something better than that .
it &apos;ll be so hot . i think it &apos;d be a game changer for us .
i &apos;m sorry , honey . tonight &apos;s not good . i gotta work .
well , not me ! so he must be cheating on both of us .
oh , he &apos;s wearing those cute shorts i got him for christmas .
if i was going to &quot; lose &quot; money , that &apos;s where i &apos;d do it .
you will thank me for using a fake name . you want phil ...
miss whitten asked if you would wait in the conference room .
you know what ? why don &apos;t i meet you after your meeting ?
i don &apos;t want to sit someplace where you and mark had sex .
but if he isn &apos;t seeing you , he &apos;s seeing someone else .
i &apos;ll drive in to meet you in the city after your meeting !
and you could probably take off all your clothes right now ...
you screw me , i screw you back . i &apos;m a lady like that .
i don &apos;t want to keep explaining this . carmela is carly !
you won &apos;t get away with this . you won &apos;t get away with this !
jesus , that was ... i think that might have been his balls .
and what &apos;s happening , &apos; cause i can &apos;t take it anymore !
it &apos;s you who &apos;s liable . so don &apos;t threaten me , honey .
katie , if she &apos;s full of shit , call her out on it .
someone gets bored and unhappy and is saying it &apos;s over .
she doesn &apos;t even know that i know they &apos;re still together .
yeah . i just wanted to clear the air , and say that ...
you know how mark does everything , and amber knows ...
no , this is where i would want to exist , right here ...
and has to go on dates . i am not equipped to go on dates .
what ? you robbed me . you three girls robbed me .
which was swelling , and his head would have just exploded .
picking up my phone is like being flashed on the subway .
and he had his computer with him .
did you have sex ?
that &apos;s probably why you &apos;re wrapping up divorce number five
he &apos;s going through so much with this divorce , and ...
mark &apos;s not just a cheating scumbag . he &apos;s also a thief .
you know what ? it just looks like you &apos;re a little bloated .
a pipe burst in the bathroom ... i have to go handle it .
i did say that , but nothing i ever told you was true .
have a seat , but please keep your dog off of my furniture .
you included nick ? bullshit ! now i know you &apos;re ...
what are you talking about ? do you know what she means ?
this may sound wrong , but i kind of want him to hurt .
no board of directors , a p.o. box for an address ...
no ! no , you can &apos;t have my husband and my brother !
i would love to , but it &apos;s kind of a tricky project ...
i care so much , and then it just comes out so harsh .
it &apos;s how he handled it .
you &apos;re just being paranoid .
what happened to model man boy and dr. not so smart ... ?
you don &apos;t get to walk out . you don &apos;t get to ice me out .
and when i get this feeling , i &apos;m usually always right .
does this window open ?
no , and for good reason .
i come here because it &apos;s like a hobby that pays well .
no , &apos; cause then i have to go home and deal with mark .
ignore her . she &apos;s working through some stuff right now .
yes , kate . exactly like that . i shit my pants .
little apartment on charles street that we &apos;d end up here ?
what is your deal ? do you not get how weird this is ?
and you &apos;re calling him mark ? you never use their names !
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here . we have so much to tell you !
and i just want to stay in our bubble a little longer .
double @-@ d , natural double @-@ d.
a triple @-@ d.
put the lawyer , the wife and the boobs together ...
i got to . there &apos;s two feet of water in my basement .
i thought you were giving him hormones .
i am !
we &apos;re thinking about something a little bigger than that .
they seem really happy . mark is making them rich !
it means he &apos;s still viable . you haven &apos;t rejected him .
though we did have to significantly reduce your share .
i &apos;m really okay . thank you . i hate being touched .
phil went for a run and amber &apos;s making frittatas .
and she is going to take half of it ! it &apos;s not fair .
okay , one more . a couple , maybe . uh ... three .
how do you feel ?
i don &apos;t know . how do you feel ?
no , we can &apos;t keep her ! we have a dog at home !
why don &apos;t you come to my investor dinner this weekend ?
deal with her . and then deal with the real problem .
ah ! i haven &apos;t seen her . we didn &apos;t have that twinkle .
that reminds me , i need you to sign these , honey .
we ran on the beach , met mark &apos;s new mistress ...
what ? again ? this is the third night this week !
the best thing to do is just not think about it too hard .
we &apos;ll go to that hot chocolate place in the morning .
the worst part about this is , you seem so nice ...
that marriage was doomed , so it wasn &apos;t cheating .
he said you cheated on him , then asked for a divorce .
i &apos;m wearing these glasses because i look like shit .
what &apos;s it called ?
&quot; no hands . &quot; isn &apos;t it great ?
the point of being pretty is that you don &apos;t have to .
don &apos;t make fun of &apos; nam . best years of my life .
and on top of it , i have to get my ducks in a row .
wow . you haven &apos;t dated just one guy in a long time .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i thought you &apos;d have your phone off .
nothing will be enough to fill the hole inside you ...
okay . are you all packed for your business meetings ?
oh , you know , sometimes i like to put on my dress .
i just thought maybe we could talk , because i , um ...
that &apos;s funny , neither did i. but apparently ...
he made me the bad guy . and he &apos;s divorcing me ?
let me tag along for a drink . you said i &apos;d like it .
you can &apos;t care for yourself unless you toughen up .
but if two million doesn &apos;t work , we shut it down .
i &apos;m really sorry . i thought i had him that time .
then let &apos;s take him down . we have him surrounded .
how long have you and my husband been seeing each other ?
where are we ? seriously . what is this , saigon ?
she &apos;s like a cliche of every wife &apos;s waking nightmare !
even if you meet a nice guy ... and by &quot; nice ... &quot;
got a worm that made his brain swell up super fast .
that is so ... okay . that &apos;s ... what an asshole !
and i honestly do not know what i &apos;m going to do at all !
as long as it works , it doesn &apos;t really matter why .
i don &apos;t think so . i &apos;ve kind of been in the zone here .
soul @-@ sucking , life @-@ ruining face crater that you ...
i can give you the names of three different lawyers .
family comes first . i &apos;ll see you when i get back .
thank you for everything . i really appreciate it .
he &apos;s going to have to give this woman half his money .
... but you looked so sad when i won , i couldn &apos;t .
and it &apos;s been operating at a total loss in the bahamas .
don &apos;t get too close to me . i think i &apos;m getting sick .
at some point you say ... i play tennis , right ?
just think of that next time you eat pig bacon .
barb melman got divorced and now she has ...
then he comes to me , &quot; oh , i have to go golfing . &quot;
i started digging around . everything was locked .
i &apos;m going to go see if our toilet can take a punch .
he has the perfect woman . what else would he need ?
you know how i told you to get your ducks in a row ?
no , no , no , no , no ! are you kidding me ? no !
cheek implants and lives in a condo in norwalk ...
that &apos;s because i have a stan , okay ? he works .
i say it &apos;s our turn to take this shit international .
about a guy who ate an undercooked pork chop and ...
that number at the bottom is your joint net worth .
sorry . you &apos;re right . we barely know each other .
he &apos;s just on a high from the business trip and ...
they &apos;re going to put in half a million as seed money .
she needs freakin &apos; brain camp ! that &apos;s my money !
and the hot rabbi &apos;s cousin ?
cut them loose .
what about your father ?
leave dad out of this !
if you want to have sex with your husband , do it
what do you want me to do ?
go to connecticut .
one night , and you go back to being a stepford ?
you &apos;re not working with hypothetical feds , are you ?
seriously , can you please say i &apos;m not a mistress ?
you cleared the roster .
i cleared the bench .
you can &apos;t ice me out . i &apos;m going to ice you out .
you have to admit , that &apos;s pretty good . seriously .
need this dog , so thanks for making no sense .
what &apos;s it like ? is it like a &apos; 70s situation ?
you want to know the truth ? your husband sucks !
okay , what are we looking for ? what &apos;s the clue ?
i &apos;m sorry , did you say you had a fecal incident ?
you &apos;re his fall guy !
you could go to jail !
while pretending not to know about his whores ...
have i made mistakes ? yes . big ones . huge ones .
that &apos;s the good news ! your name &apos;s on everything .
well , i don &apos;t know how much longer i can last ...
we &apos;ll get your number .
can we keep her ?
but she &apos;s spying on me , like a double agent .
i think you &apos;re being greedy .
i &apos;m being greedy ?
no need to read it ... it &apos;s just the usual stuff .
and not &quot; friend friend , &quot; like &quot; boning friend ! &quot;
you need a guy with something to keep him busy .
because i couldn &apos;t crack the code on his password .
that dog is trying to break me .
he really is .
has he talked to you like that , or has he ... ?
oh , my god , that &apos;s it ! he &apos;s cheating on us !
he could pick any scenario , and he picks that ?
you &apos;re the wife ! he &apos;s supposed to cheat on you !
i fee like i owe you an apology for the other night .
so forget all this bullshit and go surprise him .
and that &apos;s a happy ending . a shitty ending ...
you just have to pick a spot and be okay with it .
does this mean he &apos;s not training for the marathon ?
okay , but when you sleep with that many people ...
i think we just broke up .
no ! how come ?
let me just ...
wait . how are you doing that ?
and what do you plan on doing if you find this girl ?
i &apos;m having fun . not a lot of it , but some .
he &apos;s a liar , kate . who cares what he says ?
you have money . you have half of what mark has .
i would have never known that i needed to change .
you have a threesome , i don &apos;t flipping care !
that &apos;s not the point . i don &apos;t do married guys .
look , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re here out of ...
we bonded over dim sum and spatial reasoning .
they didn &apos;t tell me anything . they showed me .
um , i found your number in my husband &apos;s phone .
i &apos;m sorry , baby . i have to take a rain check .
carly . carmela . you &apos;re talking about carmela .
no , i was setting the mike . what do you want ?
but i think a married guy is a perfect fit for you .
i already read it for us . you just have to sign .
i need like at least a week of prep , minimum .
oh , honey ? i need you to sign some papers for me .
okay , target is moving ! target is on the move .
and then one day that ring will just be a ring .
oh , oh , oh ! hey ! hey ! hey , buddy ! i &apos;m here ! stop !
... let &apos;s never sleep with the same guy again .
you can waste your own time , but i &apos;m done .
this place is awesome . my neck was so tight .
what do i do ? now i &apos;m barb melman ?
then why call me ? for permission ?
no !
stan &apos;s wife was fat , with no sexual charisma .
let me tell you something about martha stewart .
not that you &apos;re a whore ! you &apos;re not a whore .
once you meet my dad and i meet your friends ,
it &apos;s not a mistake , honey . it &apos;s pathological .
i &apos;m wondering , what if i keep my clothes on ...
and you &apos;re just like , &quot; i wish i had a costume ! &quot;
i don &apos;t do this . i &apos;m too old for this shit .
it &apos;s too late for that .
please don &apos;t do this .

bill , i told you , don &apos;t call me at night !
we waited for someone to leave and then snuck in .
that &apos;s so smart and funny ! that &apos;s really witty .
amber got mark &apos;s password off the nanny cam .
he &apos;s your brother . what would you do with him ?
you don &apos;t see me worrying about my job , do you ?
maybe you should ask her about servicecircuit .
i &apos;m gonna do it .
if you do it , i do it .
he can &apos;t have sex till he finishes his z @-@ pak !
i got all that out of my system with that one .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m in the mistress &apos;s closet .
it &apos;s just that you were going to meet my dad ...
by the way , what is up with your hot brother ?
you don &apos;t have it in you to rip me off . no way .
you &apos;re so funny ! you &apos;ll see when you meet her .
is this some kind of stripper @-@ gram or something ?
i want him to feel what i feel , but worse .
so can i ask , what the hell are you two up to ?
sorry . it &apos;s me . don &apos;t be mad . i just ...
plus , i &apos;m traveling to miami and the bahamas .
stop the grappling ! i &apos;m strong when i &apos;m mad !
well , i &apos;m not working . and i am so freaking hot .
do you want me to wait for you ? i don &apos;t mind .
hi , can i help you ?
i can help you !
he banks , so let &apos;s go to the bahamas ...
i &apos;ll do it . i don &apos;t have a lot of feelings .
very soft skin . we met at trader joe &apos;s .
is because your wife paid all the money back .
you look gorgeous today .
thanks , honey .
she makes me look like i &apos;m wearing a diaper !
well , i was sorry to hear about you and julie .
well , shit ! i don &apos;t know ! all i know is what
i don &apos;t hate you . i don &apos;t hate you at all .
you took off your clothes to go skinny dipping .
i &apos;m saying that if you want to take him down ...
i never liked that guy . i never liked him .
no ! of course not . it &apos;s barely dark outside .
yeah , i do , because he used to touch me , too .
i was out for a jog and my hammies locked up .
oh , my god ! did you do it more than ten times ?
you okay , baby ? you need my help on this ?
let &apos;s go ! he &apos;s probably halfway there already !
this is just so unoriginal , mark ! so cliche !
or did big pussy and meadow miss you too much ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s why he &apos;s still calling .
haven &apos;t been here since i bought the place .
i mean that he &apos;s not an obvious sociopath ...
the guys on the canadian deal wanna do dinner .
you know it &apos;s not actually happening , right ?
it just felt so good to be touched , you know ?
i don &apos;t need to wreck someone &apos;s home for a date .
i &apos;m taking him to obedience school today .
white shirts and thin turkey and all that ...
so you &apos;re talking about maximum pain , right ?
and i just wanted you to be happy .
i am .
you won &apos;t see anything through those hedges .
obviously , but which one ?
the only one .
yes . and have you ever seen shit like this ?
because i said so . why , do you like her ?
there &apos;s someone here to see you ... kate king .
mark &apos;s .
no ! yours ! you &apos;re the ceo .
if we &apos;re going to do this , i need a drink .
and i started thinking , maybe he is shady .
you got to stretch it out . stretch it out .
like what , a cheating husband of my own ?
it &apos;s really nice , what you &apos;re doing for her .
but he didn &apos;t ask for forgiveness , did he ?
he &apos;s supposed to be with amber !
shit !
ray charles over here tried to pass herself off .
though technically , i have been competing
is this some tyler durden fight club thing ?
in that too @-@ horrible @-@ to @-@ be @-@ true kind of way .
i like the way your brain works , but ...
what i &apos;m doing with all your great ideas .
you &apos;ll like it . come on . i &apos;ll show you .
it &apos;s your signature all over those contracts .
i mean , do you think that he still loves me ?
empty ? what are you talking about ? how ... ?
no ! you can &apos;t get in there . i &apos;m ticklish .
okay , we &apos;re done here . i &apos;m going to do it .
he must have literally screwed your brains out !
yeah , that &apos;s me ... mistress of the year .
are you okay ? i &apos;ve been trying you all day !
i started redecorating . what do you think ?
is really throwing me into an all @-@ american rage .
we just need to find the bank he &apos;s using .
this is putting your ducks in a wood chipper !
well , this isn &apos;t putting your ducks in a row .
that &apos;s what happens when you piss people off .
no . the client said he was too emotional .
you know what ? screw it . i &apos;m coming home .
don &apos;t worry , you look good .
thanks .
if edith piaf rises out of the grave and
mark &apos;s in miami . why is he calling you ?
it turns out they &apos;re still seeing each other .
try not to make that part any worse for her .
and where in the story does he act like a jerk ?
&quot; do what you need to do . i support you &quot; ?
i went to the doctor . he gave me a z @-@ pak .
i can &apos;t stay in this mark moment forever .
and he had me believing you were the devil .
why ? they &apos;re the first things you see .
no , no . you know what ? i overreacted .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not certain i really like you yet .
where they give you exercises for your brain ?
want to know who nina is ?
not really .
but the lawyers say it &apos;s all very amicable .
okay , hold on one second . just one second .
step down . step down . okay , there you go .
this is not okay . i am part of team king .
you &apos;re so much better now .
thank you .
i did not think that i would be right at all .
you &apos;re not a whore .
let &apos;s go outside .
don &apos;t say it &apos;s a social call , because you
they were all flings , and they knew it .
each other &apos;s hair and drinking cosmos .
he saw the dog and drew his own conclusions .
i shouldn &apos;t have told you . i &apos;m so sorry .
did you ever think when we had that shitty
with women like you and just didn &apos;t know it .
he &apos;s up !
really ? what &apos;s he doing ?
you sure ? you &apos;re talking to your phone .
whole room is filled with lies and secrets .
you pulled my hair , which is totally ...
i feel bad for you . let me walk you out .
and gross and i don &apos;t want to do that !
oh ! and we need a check for the painter , too .
sorry . do you mind ? i &apos;ll just be a sec .
as far as talking to someone who won &apos;t blab ,
no ! i can &apos;t go to work with my tits taped !
try these on . these ones are very special .
one kiss and good @-@ bye . okay , that was it .
kate , you remember my partner , nick .
so i &apos;m just gonna stay in the city tonight .
don &apos;t be mad .
i &apos;m not being anything .
i can &apos;t defend you if i know you did it .
no . no . you can &apos;t ...
what ? what ?
no ! do you have a problem with the feds ?
i don &apos;t know why men find these sexy .
no , we can &apos;t . if you have any questions
wishing you &apos;d left the first time around .
and i think he &apos;s getting a little suspicious .
but for your sake , i hope you &apos;re lying .
where are you going ?
to do push @-@ ups .
mark was able to lead a whole other life
i &apos;m carly . you must be his housekeeper .
we &apos;re not in competition . we got played
i know how assholes do asshole @-@ y things ...
oh , my god ! i am obsessed with that idea .
but that &apos;s just me . he &apos;s your husband .
i thought she was his ex @-@ mistress , but ...
mentioning your new friend carly to mark ?
i don &apos;t know ! there &apos;s been wine , and ...
the one thing we &apos;re not giving him ... sex .
did you just say something about the bahamas ?
i will wind up in gen pop . turn around .
there &apos;s got to be a little latch or something .
for basically forcing me to be your friend .
wake up . you &apos;re making out with your dog .
my zipper just got caught on my necklace .
you saw him ?
he came over after work
i was crazy to think we could be friends .
maybe one of us should sleep with him .
no , i &apos;m telling you something feels off .
i feel like i need to go to brain camp .
they wanted a ruthless law robot , so ...
but there &apos;s something very wrong with that .
i mean , has he ever said he loves you ?
no , i can see you . go out the window .
no . you think he &apos;s an evil sociopath .
on that happy note , who needs a drink ?
feng shui is good &apos; cause it &apos;s important ...
they &apos;re having some kind of group breakdown .
lives a couple of streets over on clark .
somebody &apos;s being negative . i &apos;m gonna go .
it &apos;s not your fault i married a monster .
you mostly just yelled at me the whole time .
okay , you know what ? feng shui rules .
think about it . between the two of us ...
and i hate that you keep saying it &apos;s dumb !
i can &apos;t talk to you until you stop crying .
oh , no ! you &apos;re going to connecticut now ?
i chickened out and said i had chlamydia !
wow ! thank you . that really means a lot .
you , too . i hope i see you again soon .
well , it &apos;s going to suck for a little while .
and have no flab and not need a wax ...
oh , hell , no ! now he &apos;s crossed the line !
so you haven &apos;t called him , full silent
he &apos;ll look at the office while you go .
i didn &apos;t know , so i &apos;m not a mistress .
i &apos;ll see if he can meet tomorrow night .
well , if we don &apos;t leave until tomorrow ,
he ain &apos;t losing money , he &apos;s robbing it .
the last time i was single , i was 24
it &apos;s not like i cared about any of them .
are you still sleeping with my husband ?
if you weren &apos;t as disgusting as you were ...
and i get first dibs on what &apos;s in the bag .
incredible .
he didn &apos;t even notice !
i needed some pants and the only person
done ? that wasn &apos;t even a conversation .
maybe we should have a drink and talk .
you become the enemy . if he thinks ...
sometimes i can be more tough than love .
you &apos;re his soul mate . i &apos;m a whore .
i might not always get it right , but ...
about your husband , you should ask him .
i heard , and he &apos;s meeting somebody !
now i &apos;m all worn in like an old glove .
and then divorces me for fake @-@ cheating ?
you should think about being nicer to me ...
the guys loved your gift card swap idea .
you think we could let a sister down ?
you had sex with my husband fifty times ? !
oh , baby , send me a picture , will you ?
i get it . things are coming into focus .
but if you want to talk , we can . sure .
hi . i &apos;m kate . i met you on friday .
now i &apos;m totally serious , like ... not ...
huh , could this day get any worse ? really ? !
you know how sometimes you get like a ...
what we &apos;re doing , where we &apos;re going ...
you &apos;re saying i should stay with him .
i wish he stopped sending me pictures !
and when she &apos;s done running around with you ,
oh . you &apos;re not a mistress .
thank you .
she &apos;s not a hooker . she &apos;s just a slut .
he &apos;s a contractor .
oh , a contractor .
good @-@ bye .
fine . forget i called .
i &apos;ll get us some drinks . scotch okay ?
then cry on the inside , like a winner .
doesn &apos;t mark see you naked all the time ?
let &apos;s say i was hedging my willpower .
um . i &apos;ll send you a check for your urn .
oh , there it is ... the end of the road .
oh , well , i would , but i &apos;m pretty sure ...
no , don &apos;t go just yet . just one kiss .
maybe i should just tell him in person .
i don &apos;t think we have the same size foot .
when that happens , i have to stretch .
he can &apos;t give away what he doesn &apos;t have .
you could go lay on a beach and get tan
does this open ? the window ? anywhere ?
so you needed the pillows to resist me .
we &apos;ll get dressed up and you can see ...
i heard him on the phone with her ...
you girls started in on the tequila ...
he &apos;s still treating me like i &apos;m blind .
you know , what the hell do you know ?
it &apos;s like a midlife crisis mistress !
i think you &apos;re being hard on yourself .
in order to make yourself feel better .
just to let some steam out of the pot .
what happened to just painting it red ?
okay , but you &apos;re not going to like it .
or anything . just like a fig leaf .
kate might actually have a point about
you &apos;re calling because you got a zit ?
and you ambush prince charming &apos;s wife .
no . please keep the lid on the pot .
it was like this red mist came over me .
oh , by the way , your dad called ...
you and your vagina need to just ...
that &apos;s what he said ? that i cheated ?
except for carly . we were exclusive .
of age @-@ appropriate men who are old ...
yeah . i couldn &apos;t be more okay . what ?
he &apos;s lying to me and sleeping with you .
they should have that for your brain .
don &apos;t mention the whole mistress thing .
morbid curiosity , or you and kate
you think he has more than one here ?
because it &apos;s just a matter of time before
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re not interested .
my friends are mark &apos;s friends ...
we are . the weirdest friends ever .
you come back and you &apos;re super smart .
my wife &apos;s not some criminal mastermind .
and i don &apos;t want to complicate things .
just pulled over for a little stretch .
and i like to think i &apos;m a good guy , so ...
and if i keep talking to myself ...
where are you going ?
i don &apos;t know .
feng shui is not what you think it is !
stop frowning before you break your face .
he has a wife , okay ? he &apos;s married .
i really thought we were soul mates .
who didn &apos;t try to rob me was a hipster .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
everything !
and we had the bathroom in the kitchen ?
why do i schedule breakfast meetings ?
oh , no , no , no . you &apos;re all lying .
i would put a coffee table right here ...
i @-@ i got to go . i got to go , baby .
it &apos;s gingko biloba . balboa was rocky .
that can &apos;t be right . it &apos;s a trick !
while we &apos;re having sex ?
really ?
if i let you in , we are not braiding
servicecircuit . this is it , kate .
that &apos;s not true . you &apos;re not alone .
he has been working his whole life ...
i &apos;m sorry . i had no idea . i swear .
did you and tony enjoy hong kong ?
who &apos;s mark ?
the guy i &apos;m seeing .
he &apos;s got that look in his eyes , that ...
we met in hong kong . i told you .
i know exactly what i would do with it .
does that hurt ? tune in tokyo . -ah !
so i could have my morning coffee .
let &apos;s get into the car . be very careful .
i had a little edith piaf moment ...
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , i feel so awful .
i just don &apos;t know if i can hold out .
i want out of the loop ! take me out .
i wouldn &apos;t even be me without you .
i can &apos;t even remember to shave my legs .
i &apos;m really happy we &apos;re doing this .
then what , you pull out my weave ?
from now on , you have to tell me
you should go . i &apos;ll call you later .
you &apos;re clueless , you have an edge .
big year . great job .
thanks .
the skull was holding his brain ...
oh , just some stuff for the accountant .
i can &apos;t go to jail ! no , no , no .
you &apos;re worried about him .
i am .
i can go with you . that &apos;d be fun .
and they &apos;ll blab ! you are literally
only young , hot girls drive jettas !
you said we just had to find out where
forget what ?
dinner with phil .
otherwise , his brain would have ...
that &apos;s the best part of the house .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with you ,
there &apos;s a difference between having sex
then it &apos;s going to suck a little less .
i know that you think it &apos;s that bad ,
oh , boo @-@ hoo ! he cheated on me , too !
we need to find mark and his bank .
this looks like a box of bungee cords .
this is what happens when carly makes
well , i heard a story on the news ...
i can &apos;t believe he was cheating on me !
and they implanted it in his groin ...
it &apos;s not a big deal . it &apos;s very new .
did you just start sleeping together ?
or anything and just be ready to go .
i think i &apos;m having a nervous breakdown .
mark , you &apos;re not a very nice person .
okay , fine . gun to my head ...
hey , nick ! hey , man ! i ... what ?
and though it brought us together ,
i was with the board last night .
what are you doing ? what is that ?
don &apos;t do this , kate . i love you .
you have a perfect killing machine .
just promise when you meet her ...
those bank transfers you gave me ...
if you killed him , don &apos;t tell me .
they &apos;re putting more money into it .
i have no friends to talk to because
that &apos;s how you run a double agent .
come on , let &apos;s get you in the car .
a lot .
i don &apos;t want to hear that .
we &apos;ll find out what amber knows .
you &apos;ll end up back where you started ,
i can &apos;t wait for the site to go up .
i can change . you can help me .
who knows what &apos;s happening besides me !
oh , my god , i &apos;ve hit rock bottom .
i &apos;ll tell you all about it at dinner .
ah , the chuzzlewit pinch .
you can tell me . i won &apos;t be mad .
because my whole world just blew up
can we get three punches , please ?
the details do matter , because ...
is it ever going to get any easier ?
i just can &apos;t believe he &apos;d lie to me .
me cry on the inside like a winner !
friends that love every part of you .
okay , let &apos;s go this way . all right .
so they don &apos;t have to wear glasses .
all right . if you really want to .
you slept with him , didn &apos;t you .
well , it &apos;s not a big deal , but ...
he &apos;s back to sexting like a freak .
i have so many lotions at the house .
we weren &apos;t happy . now we are .
are you okay ?
actually , no .
no , i really don &apos;t understand this .
mmm @-@ hmm . -i realized that with you .
we &apos;re adults . we had sex .
if we put our brains together ...
that &apos;s like a really good thought , and
mark , you &apos;re a real piece of shit .
here you go . thanks for the ride .
there are so many people in the world
she &apos;s the perfect ten lemon tart ...
what a cute dress !
thank you !
no , there &apos;s no room under the bed .
but it was really nice meeting you .
what it does is hold your tits up .
we valued everything you own , and ...
we &apos;re getting the band back together .
like in switzerland or the bahamas .
affairs ? you &apos;re looking at it .
what ? oh , yeah !
don &apos;t do that .
and it &apos;s not all hong kong , either .
she told me about this naan bread .
i want a divorce , mark .
no .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s how it works .
you &apos;ll send me the lawyers &apos; names ?
she comes in peace , so be nice .
your indian girl didn &apos;t veto that ?
because i took it away from him .
and it all went downhill from there .
if i wanted to protect my money
when did you start eating naan ?
no . no . i have the wrong address .
i &apos;m carmela , kate &apos;s decorator .
you mean he should hide his money ?
and then i started thinking that this
he &apos;s taken this shit international !
i don &apos;t know what they told you .
are you serious ? it &apos;s a window !
let me just lay down for a minute .
things got really tough in here , huh ?
doing the benson depo on tuesday ...
with one of my sorority sisters .
okay , turn around . turn around .
by the same guy . i call it a tie .
maybe i can make it go away , huh ?
he said that ... i was the cheater ?
and a set of dates for deposition .
hi , sweetie ! you &apos;re home early !
because you think we &apos;re friends
you weren &apos;t going to mention these ?
that &apos;s crazy .
it &apos;s a miracle .
don &apos;t worry , we didn &apos;t hook up .
if we find any more mistresses ,
the @-@ awful @-@ thing @-@ doesn &apos;t @-@ happen thing .
it brings up our group average .
you don &apos;t think you can take her ?
please focus .
i am focused !
are the weirdest friends ever ...
you jumped out a window for me .
this isn &apos;t frickin &apos; sister wives .
i &apos;m not saying you have to be bald
you really like this guy , huh ?
i don &apos;t know ... a couple months .
well , what if he &apos;s in love with you ?
and the dating pool was everyone !
i need you to buy me some pants .
and in china who love feng shui .
one time and having sex ten times .
her bringing up the group average .
okay . i &apos;ll keep you in the loop ?
you don &apos;t think i can handle it ?
that &apos;s right , bitch ! chlamydia !
i &apos;m sorry . um ... where were we ?
a pretty little patch of happiness .
one time , or two out of three ?
you get it wrong all the time .
you know when you get like that ?
it &apos;s not bullshit .
it is .
i can weather a little hate sex .
the say @-@ the @-@ awful @-@ thing @-@ so @-@ that-
i have a friend who could do it .
when people have lazy eyes ...
a z @-@ pak ? i &apos;m not sick , though .
milk ? my husband prefers goat .
this is what it &apos;s come to , huh ?
he is ! but better me than you .
good idea . never .
ever .
i think specifics are a bad idea .
we were pretty out of our heads ,
just a hint of a zit and you ...
we could just cuddle and sleep in .
well , actually , the phone bill ,
we should get out of here . now .
i thought maybe we could talk ?
but honestly , it &apos;s a lot worse .
and fix that young man &apos;s plumbing .
okay , fernando , go , go , go !
anyway , speaking of changes ...
yeah , it &apos;s like a dream come true .
it is . but we can work it out .
she handled prison like a boss !
put your foot down . please go .
no ! that &apos;s being very greedy .
i &apos;m exactly where i want to be .
kate , i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t .
are you serious ?
or more !
you &apos;re sleeping with my husband ? !
and i &apos;ve been so worried about him .
treatment and he &apos;s still calling ?
i think it &apos;s good she &apos;s super hot .
mark king to see miss whitten .
we should kick him in the balls !
they become a part of this ...
mark is flying down this week .
if you could , do it today .
pick at it a little bit , and ...
enough for a pre @-@ op transsexual .
i won &apos;t be back tomorrow night .
as a blind woman to get upstairs .
by &quot; losing &quot; it , what would i do ?
how are you ?
not too great .
is that there &apos;s lying and cheating
then i &apos;m still involved , and ...
next time , call a plumber .
i &apos;m looking for a different mark .
i canceled . what &apos;s all this ?
i &apos;m insecure . i have issues .
and i just can &apos;t do that anymore .
it &apos;s something that rhymes with ...
everything is wrong with you .
you have one hour .
okay .
and you let her because ... ?
it looks like you put on weight .
no , you don &apos;t want to do that .
i can &apos;t even read these anymore .
this is me being done .
fine .
is that still circling the drain ?
why did you have your phone on ?
she &apos;ll realize that &apos;s gone .
i didn &apos;t know he was in miami .
get away . get away , get away !
you &apos;re sleeping with my husband ?
you told me that was next week .
my husband likes this pasta .
can be just as shady as he can .
and what about meeting my dad ?
obviously i did something wrong .
you still want those ?
yeah .
i think it &apos;s great .
you do ?
i hate working on the weekends .

but we just have that twinkle .
you can &apos;t get excited about it ...
you guys have no faith in me .
i was keeping you in the loop .

but it &apos;s such an icebreaker .
it &apos;s already in the air , guy .
they get their eyes worked out
and drink gingko balboa all day .

my name &apos;s all over everything !
i &apos;ll have to send her to rehab .

she &apos;s my little idea factory .
a concept called restitution .
