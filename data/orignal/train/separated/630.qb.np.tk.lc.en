you have to get him to a hospital .
i gotta get outta here and finish what amanda started
before it &apos;s too late .
the graysons framed her father .
now that conrad &apos;s running for governor ,
he &apos;ll be forced to vacate his seat on grayson global &apos;s board ,
which means that you can get closer to daniel .
look , we make one hell of a team .
you deal me back in , and i swear , the sky &apos;s the limit .
in spite of our strained history ,
amanda was , um , family ,
as are you and your son .
on top of all the misery ,
to find out that you were lying to me , too ?
did you know about her plan for the graysons ?
jack , i am so sorry about everything .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
i &apos;ve gotta bury my wife in an hour .
hoping i could come by and visit you next week ,
talk about finding a way to honor amanda .
my door is always open .
the amanda clarke i knew was a survivor .
who are you ?
i &apos;m her brother .
&quot; oh , a match .
it might afford her a world of comfort ... &quot;
if only she dared to strike one . &quot;
&quot; it was a bright and wondrous flame , like a candle ,
&quot; and she carefully warmed her hands over it .
it was ... &quot;
&quot; a wonderful light . &quot;
to carry a secret is to play with fire .
try to pass it on , and you risk hurting someone else .
hold on to it ...
and eventually , you &apos;ll get burned .
are you certain that nobody knows about this place ?
not a chance .
this is our safe haven .
and you definitely look like you &apos;re in need of one .
where have you been ?
i went to the cemetery ...
to have a quiet moment with my father and amanda .
i can imagine the depths that solitude brought you to .
i wasn &apos;t alone , aiden .
my foster brother showed up .
i haven &apos;t seen him in ... 14 years .
i ... i assume he didn &apos;t recognize you .
no .
no , but him being here is the last thing
that i need right now .
have you any reason to think he may wish you ill ?
i burned down our house .
why do you always draw the same thing ?
so i never forget what my father did .
killed all those people ?
he lied to me .
who &apos;s lighting matches ?
hide .
amanda ! eli !
what did i say about playing with fire ?
where &apos;s amanda ?
i haven &apos;t seen her .
liar .
into the bin . let &apos;s go .
eli was my protector .
and in return ,
i promised never to let anything separate us .
and nothing ever did until ...
i set that fire .
i have a ton more from the wedding
if you need me to print them out .
oh , no . i think these will suffice .
mom , this idea for a foundation in amanda &apos;s name ,
it &apos;s such an amazing way to honor her .
for you to be dedicating your time to it ,
i &apos;m just so proud of you both .
see you , sweetheart .
oh , good morning , daniel .
how did you sleep ?
i didn &apos;t . i &apos;m still trying to figure out
what the initiative is planning and how to stop it .
the success of their schemes lies in
keeping the pieces disparate
so as to prevent anyone from connecting the dots .
you &apos;d do better concentrating on deflecting the blame .
by placing it on aaiden mathis .
better him than you .
even after he proved his loyalty ?
you need to watch your back with that one .
have you forgotten his pursuit of emily ?
and he was instrumental in my ousting at the company , was he not ?
no more so than i was .
yeah , a betrayal for which i &apos;ve only just begun to forgive you ,
but you are my blood .
mathis is a ... common parasite .
would you say the same about david clarke
or his daughter ?
i know ruining lives is in your d. n. a.
but i &apos;m not allowing another innocent person
to pay the price for our sins .
i wish that i could expedite the claim on your wife &apos;s policy ,
but i &apos;m afraid it won &apos;t be fully processed
until the criminal investigation is closed .
i understand .
if it would give you peace of mind ...
i could set up a life insurance policy
to make sure that your baby is taken care of ...
in the unlikely event of another tragedy .
yeah . i think that &apos;d be a good idea .
i &apos;ll draw up the paperwork and i &apos;ll give you a call .
thanks .
you okay ?
i &apos;m just going crazy trying to make sense of that night .
what happened out there ?
somebody pulls me out of the water ,
calls an ambulance for me , doesn &apos;t leave a name ?
i &apos;m still trying to figure out why nolan told me
you two had checked in to the hotel in nantucket .
he said that ?
yeah . i gotta go .
hello .
jack , it &apos;s victoria grayson .
i know how difficult this time is for you right now ,
so please allow me to be brief .
i appreciate that .
well , conrad and i remain devastated over your terrible loss .
and we asked ourselves how we could keep amanda alive
in more than just our hearts .
so we arrived at this idea
of creating a foundation in her name .
you mean like a charity ?
precisely .
in light of amanda &apos;s difficult childhood ,
we thought our goal could be a better tomorrow by promoting
and protecting the well @-@ being of children today .
we could call it the amanda clarke foundation
or the amanda porter foundation if you like .
amanda clarke &apos;s more appropriate .
then can i say we have your blessing ?
yeah , you have my blessing .
thank you .
i &apos;ll speak to you soon .
what a wonderful idea .
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
charlotte called me and told me what you were up to ,
and i would love to offer my services as co @-@ chair , victoria .
what do you think ?
oh , a quarter of a million dollars . that &apos;s very generous .
i &apos;ll take your offer under consideration .
pardon me . there &apos;s a young man at the door .
he says he &apos;s amanda clarke &apos;s brother .
foster brother to be specific .
eli james .
it &apos;s an honor to meet you , mrs. grayson .
第二季第十六集
my apologies , mr. james , but this is quite unexpected .
well , as was the news of my sister &apos;s death .
your daughter charlotte invited me .
unfortunately , without enough lead time to make the funeral .
well , it was a lovely ceremony .
i &apos;m sure amanda would &apos;ve appreciated the fact
that you did everything you could to be there .
mr. james , emily thorne .
you look ... familiar . do i know you ?
we met at the cemetery .
of course . of course .
you said that you , uh , knew amanda well .
i @-@ i did . i &apos;m her baby &apos;s godmother .
she looks happy .
how long are you in town for , mr. james ?
i hadn &apos;t put a clock on it .
i was on my way back from business in london when i heard the news .
well , what line of business are you in ?
rare books .
fascinating .
well , if your schedule allows ,
we would love for you to be an honored guest
at the inaugural benefit in your sister &apos;s name .
i would love to .
excuse me .
hello .
i &apos;m at your house . where are you ?
i &apos;m with victoria .
she &apos;s putting together a foundation in honor of amanda .
i wanted to see how i could help .
i bet you did . well ...
don &apos;t let me interrupt .
oh , my god . i completely forgot .
stay there . i &apos;ll be right down .
i am so sorry . i am late for a breakfast meeting .
um , maybe i can call you later , victoria ,
to continue our discussion ?
certainly .
it was a pleasure to meet you .
thanks .
and since i &apos;ll be staying for a while ,
i look forward to getting to know you ...
and all the people who knew my sister , of course .
speaking of which , is , uh , charlotte here ?
i wanted to say thank you for inviting me .
oh , i &apos;m afraid my daughter &apos;s still at school .
but i &apos;m sure amanda &apos;s husband would love to meet you ,
and i can give you directions to his tavern .
perfect .
i don &apos;t even know him , nolan . i was 13 .
but i highly doubt that
he was in london buying antique books last week .
well , you think we could be dealing with another tyler ?
tyler was sick . eli is a wild card .
but if he figures out who i am , he could ruin everything .
well , i &apos;ll check him out .
so long as padma &apos;s in a holding pattern with the initiative ,
it &apos;ll be a welcome distraction .
they haven &apos;t reached out to her yet ?
not a peep . she &apos;s in seclusion until they do .
where are you going ?
i have to talk to jack before eli does .
well , i thought jack wasn &apos;t talking to you .
you do know that guilt is a bottom @-@ feeder ?
it can &apos;t be drowned in your afternoon tumbler .
oh , i &apos;m sorry if i can &apos;t reconcile the taking of a life
as easily as you .
the name &quot; amanda clarke &quot; keeps ringing my ears .
well , then we have something in common .
but where you let it consume you ,
your mother and i have chosen to resurrect her .
oh , by slapping her name on a charity .
if i recall , you did the exact same thing
when you created the victims united fund
after the crash of flight 1 @-@ 9 @-@ 7 .
well , it &apos;s a bit of good born of tragedy .
and which did , by the way , help me sleep a little better .
hopefully a similar gesture will do the same for you .
and what exactly is in my future , the aiden mathis fund ?
the head of the charles .
it seems like that regatta was just ... yesterday .
20 meters to go with your scull 2 lengths behind ,
and you drew on your god @-@ given strength to win .
seeing you awarded this medal was one of my proudest moments .
thanks for the walk down memory lane .
yeah , a walk i can take only because
i wasn &apos;t rotting away in some cell missing your accomplishments .
daniel ... we do what we do not for ourselves ,
but for something beyond ourselves--
me for the family i already had ,
and you for the family i &apos;d like to imagine is in your future .
daniel , i ...
uh , mr. grayson . how do you do ?
quite well , mr. mathis , as do you , i understand .
daniel was just telling me his plan to nominate you
as my successor to the board .
yes , well , your endorsement would mean a great deal .
i don &apos;t see why i shouldn &apos;t .
given the profitable direction of the firm ,
i &apos;ve come to trust my son &apos;s judgment .
well , thank you very much .
uh , daniel , if you &apos;d like to grab a drink after work ,
there &apos;s some acquisition proposals i &apos;d like to run by you .
sounds great .
will you excuse me a second ?
yeah .
what can i do for you ?
jack , listen , i know i @-@ i hurt you .
it was just , um ...
kind of hoping that you &apos;d give me another chance .
okay .
how about you start by answering a question ?
when you and amanda were in juvie ,
what was the opinion she had of her father ?
what do you mean ?
i got her foster brother here saying the entire time he knew her ,
she hated her dad .
he said that to you ?
among other things .
now if that &apos;s true ,
why would amanda risk everything trying to prove
that the graysons had david clarke framed ?
all right . thanks , jack .
will i be seeing you at the foundation party ?
wouldn &apos;t miss it .
good .
eli , emily--
don &apos;t worry .
mrs. grayson introduced us this morning .
jack ...
guy has got the weight of the world on his shoulders .
not at all the , uh , footloose dock boy you told me about .
is he , amanda ?
that &apos;s a nice tattoo .
you &apos;re lookin &apos; pretty good for a dead girl .
you really fell off the map after you did your time .
i mean , i spent years trying to track you down ,
but all i found was a stripper passing herself off as you .
when i saw her photo ,
i knew you weren &apos;t really dead .
so ... what &apos;s the con ?
no con . i just got sick of trying to outrun my name ...
so i traded it for the one i have now .
so emily thorne-- that &apos;s the ... dead girl ?
that doesn &apos;t seem like an even trade to me .
i mean , you got money and shed the name ,
but the stripper gets a broke @-@ ass boyfriend
and a one @-@ way ticket to the bottom of the atlantic ?
eli ...
why did you come here ?
i already told you .
your illegitimate sister invited me .
if it &apos;s money that you want , i &apos;ve got plenty of it .
but i can &apos;t have you staying here .
you &apos;re not worried that i &apos;m gonna mess things up , are you ?
i mean , you--you do remember who you &apos;re talking to , right ?
everyone says you set that fire at your last house on purpose .
people believe what they want to believe .
tell me the truth . i &apos;ll believe you .
amanda , get back up here .
the petersen family wants a second look .
don &apos;t blow it .
look , it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t trust you . i do .
i &apos;ve just worked really hard at starting over .
and it seems like you have , too .
antique books ?
that &apos;s just a scam i run on dumb rich people .
i also got &apos; em believing i graduated cum laude from columbia .
eli , these people might be rich , but they &apos;re not dumb .
eventually , they &apos;re gonna figure you out .
well , i can &apos;t have that .
i &apos;ve already got outstanding warrants in three states .
what if i told you that i had a way
to wipe your record clean ?
you can make that happen ?
i &apos;ll even provide the means for you to start over .
you just have to do it somewhere else .
well , if it ain &apos;t danny grayson , king of the world .
i know you ?
nah , i &apos;m just a grunt over at ellicot &amp; cowles .
i know . it &apos;s not top tier like grayson global .
i actually got my m.b.a ..
hey , not now , pal .
i was just wondering if maybe you could recommend a red to me--
something in the million @-@ dollar range .
i &apos;m serious , man . back off .
hey , i admire you .
you know , you get handed the keys to the kingdom ,
and then here you are getting sauced before closing bell .
i said back off .
say it walking , my friend . now .
what the hell are you doing ?
i don &apos;t need you to defend me .
trust me , i was saving that guy , and you from a lawsuit . okay ?
i heard what he &apos;s saying .
he &apos;s the one that &apos;s trying to make money the easy way .
what the hell is it with you anyway ?
first you come after my job , then my fiancee .
now you want to be my guardian angel ?
i was protecting your best interests .
yeah , well , maybe you should start protecting your own .
you think you want my life ?
be careful what you wish for .
mr. mathis . i was wondering
if you might share a few minutes to discuss some business .
particularly , my son . i &apos;m concerned about him .
i think that would be a great idea .
your timing couldn &apos;t be better .
well , timing , as they say , is everything .
in the corner to your left .
help you ?
my name &apos;s jack porter .
the police said an ambulance picked me up
from this slip over labor day weekend .
you the guy from that boat fire ?
yeah .
sorry to hear about your wife .
terrible thing that happened .
yeah , thanks .
i don &apos;t suppose you were here that night .
i already told the cops everything i know .
my wife died that night ,
and i have no idea what happened to her out there .
do you have any idea what that &apos;s like ?
look , i &apos;m just trying to get some answers here .
somebody pulled me onto these docks and saved my life .
if it wasn &apos;t you , just tell me who it was .
i can &apos;t go on like this . please .
a guy called asking to charter my speedboat on labor day--
&quot; the rose gray . &quot;
i left the boat key in an envelope for him inside the console .
without ever having met him ?
later that night , he called again .
we met back here on the dock .
there was blood everywhere .
so he paid me money-- a lot of money--
to keep me from asking questions
and to buy &quot; the rose gray &quot; outright .
and you didn &apos;t catch a name ?
like i said , he paid cash .
do you remember what he looked like ?
tall , sandy hair , blue eyes ...
that &apos;s all i remember , kid . anyone asks ...
they &apos;ll hear a different story . i got a family , too .
yeah . that &apos;s all right .
you told me plenty .
victoria .
quite the turnout . i can only imagine what amanda would say
if she were here .
i can think of a few things .
nolan , it &apos;s lovely to see you .
hello , victoria .
emily , my apologies for not getting back to you
on your offer to co @-@ chair ,
but to be honest , with all your philanthropic commitments ,
i don &apos;t think that you have time to fulfill
what this position demands .
so you found another candidate ?
well , i am considering my options .
excuse me .
charming event .
much more handsome than his mug shot .
not exactly a face that screams &quot; extortion &quot;
and &quot; embezzlement , &quot; is it ?
hey there , emily , right ?
eli , this is nolan .
he &apos;s assisting in what we discussed .
got it .
nice to meet you , nolan .
shall we , then ? i &apos;d like to get a jump on the raw bar .
eli james .
that &apos;s quite the criminal record .
any relationship to jesse ?
can we wipe the slate or not ?
and as promised ,
some money to get you started somewhere else .
now will you go ?
that , uh ... was the deal ,
but ... i wouldn &apos;t want to be rude
by bowing out of the party too soon .
excuse me .
i am not entirely convinced your faux bro
plans to hold up his end of the bargain .
well , i &apos;ll have to make sure he does .
cheers .
charlotte .
hey , you looking for an escape route ?
declan , you made it .
where were you all day ? did you skip school ?
i tried calling you .
sorry . my day just slipped away .
here you are .
hey , man .
hi .
eli james .
declan .
eli grew up with amanda .
declan is amanda &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law .
and your boyfriend .
ah . well , charlotte here is a sweetheart .
she was nice enough to show me around the island today .
so that &apos;s where your day went ?
can we talk ?
sure , but can it wait ?
there are a few people i wanted to introduce eli to .
hey , man . why don &apos;t i get you a drink ?
you look like you could use it .
you know what ? i &apos;m good .
you guys go ahead and , uh ...
you call me when you &apos;re not so preoccupied .
only ashley davenport can whip together
such an elegant gala so quickly .
thanks , emily .
i &apos;m glad someone appreciates
that these parties don &apos;t just throw themselves .
listen ... you know the heads @-@ up
that you gave me about amanda ?
i wanted to return the favor
before anybody else gets hurt .
amanda &apos;s foster brother ?
what about him ?
he and amanda were not as close as he &apos;s claiming .
amanda told me that a couple of years ago ,
he looked her up at the club she was working at .
he was in trouble with some people .
he needed some money .
if i were the graysons , i wouldn &apos;t be comfortable
with him under this roof .
okay . i &apos;m on it .
i take it that &apos;s the prodigal brother .
in the flesh .
and on the prowl , by the looks of it .
well , maybe i could take a few pointers
on wooing grayson offspring .
daniel still hasn &apos;t spoken to me
since his meltdown in midtown .
does he know that his father intervened ?
no , not yet .
and still no details on the position
that conrad wants to discuss with you ?
no , but i have a feeling i &apos;m about to find out .
look , in the meantime ,
why don &apos;t you give daniel a push ?
help assuage his guilt about putting me
between him and the initiative .
no , it &apos;s too risky .
he &apos;ll question my motives
from the moment i knock on his door .
well , perhaps i can lead him to yours .
are you telling me
eli &apos;s a wolf in sheep &apos;s clothing ?
because all i can see is the sheep .
if he and amanda were , in fact , estranged ,
then why is he here ? what does he want ?
what every sheep wants--
money , status . who cares ?
i &apos;m just relieved he &apos;s not allied
with that poor lost soul .
who told you this anyway ?
emily thorne .
well , all the more reason to welcome him with open arms .
i can handle anyone who operates in subterfuge ,
present company included .
you gotta be kidding me .
look , um ...
i &apos;m just here to try and talk some sense into you .
we &apos;re not friends . i accept that .
but i know it &apos;s not like you to be in your cups at midday
or take on some shiny suit at the slightest provocation .
as long as my future &apos;s tied up with yours ,
i have a stake in your well @-@ being .
mm . i &apos;m touched .
you gonna recommend a therapist ?
no .
but i do know someone you can talk to .
look , you , uh ...
you accused me of having designs on your ex ,
but i assure you , i &apos;ve moved on .
emily , on the other hand , hasn &apos;t .
and that was , uh ...
painfully evident for the entire time we dated .
i just thought you should know .
and if there &apos;s anyone who can
help you through whatever it is you &apos;re suffering ,
then we both know she &apos;s a good listener .
did she put you up to this ?
&apos;cause i imagine it &apos;s how you scored your invite tonight .
no .
once again , your instincts fail you .
it was your father who summoned me .
regardless of what you &apos;re gonna donate ,
it &apos;s gonna be , i don &apos;t know , half of it &apos;s--
can i have a word ?
well , i certainly hope this word is worth 100 grand ,
because that &apos;s about the size of the donation you just scared off .
yeah , i hope your explanation &apos;s worth twice that ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna take you out right here in front of everyone .
oh , variations on the theme you set at happy hour .
aiden mathis just told me
you appointed him treasurer of the foundation .
what the hell are you doing ?
what you don &apos;t have the brass to do .
whilst every dime we collect in amanda clarke &apos;s honor
will be distributed to those in need ,
neither the patrons ...
nor the future treasurer of the a.c.f.
will ever be aware of its true purpose .
this whole foundation &apos;s a front ?
you , you are unbelievable .
after the downing of flight 197,
the investigation tied up all of our capital .
we could have lost everything , daniel .
well , this time , i &apos;m intent on keeping our assets
out of the government &apos;s reach .
yeah , well , and here i thought you were just doing this for your conscience .
no , in fact ...
my intent here was to lift the weight off yours .
you &apos;ve clearly been dragging your feet in targeting mr. mathis .
and as you said ,
i &apos;ve already framed one man , right ?
listen to me .
when the initiative inevitably lowers its hammer ,
it needs to appear that
mr. mathis not only assisted in the plot
but has also taken off with our money .
we will be safe legally and financially .
i &apos;ve made the first move in that direction .
the next is yours , son .
amanda and i weren &apos;t just friends .
we were family .
check out faux bro
climbing mount grayson like it ain &apos;t no thang .
i &apos;m gonna go over there .
and even though it &apos;s been over a decade since i last saw her ...
she left a lifelong impression .
she was amazing , wasn &apos;t she ?
she was .
amanda told me that she felt so much guilt for what she did ,
starting that fire .
you must blame her to some degree .
what is this about ?
well , the foster home where we lived ,
amanda and i were called invisibles--
the kind of kids adoptive parents wanted nothing to do with--
too old , too jaded .
only thing we had to rely on was each other .
until one day , it looked like a family might actually
take her in after all .
i always thought that
she started that fire so they wouldn &apos;t want her ,
and ...
we could stay together .
i don &apos;t think i could imagine a sadder way to grow up .
it wasn &apos;t easy ,
especially for amanda .
she was a troubled girl .
well , who &apos;s to judge ?
after the hand life dealt her ,
whose daughter she was ...
and yet , here you are ,
a shining example of a child who persevered--
from a foster home to columbia university .
well , in the face of tragedy , i count myself lucky .
after the fire , i went on to a better home ,
a family who adopted me and gave me a real education .
which is why i ...
wanted to donate this to the cause .
$ 100,000 .
in honor of amanda ,
and all of the ... invisible children .
evening , everyone .
i &apos;m jack porter . uh ...
i wasn &apos;t sure if i was even gonna make it tonight .
i didn &apos;t know if i could face reality .
amanda was--
she was my wife .
but in light of everything ... yhat , uh , happened ,
i realized ...
i can count my true friends on one hand .
and the graysons are among them .
so , victoria , conrad , thank you ...
for giving me hope
that something good might come from all this .
thank you all for being here .
we applaud your bravery , mr. porter .
thank you , everyone , for being here tonight
and for helping us launch the amanda clarke foundation ...
jack ,
what are you doing here ?
practicing .
practicing what ?
lying through my teeth like you and emily .
whoa , whoa , buddy--
i found the guy that you bought &quot; the rose gray &quot; from .
what the hell &apos;s &quot; the rose gray &quot; ?
the boat , nolan .
you were the one who rescued me .
you were there the night amanda died .
okay , jack , listen , i--
no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m done listening to you .
if you or emily were my real friends ,
you would &apos;ve told me the truth in the beginning .
and you wouldn &apos;t be here rubbing elbows
with the people responsible for her death ,
the very people she came here to destroy .
what was that about ?
uh , nothing i can &apos;t handle .
you &apos;ve got your hands full right now .
not to mention vigorous and bold ,
which is why i simply can &apos;t imagine a better soul
to join me as co @-@ chair than eli james .
come up here , eli .
mrs. grayson .
i thought we had a deal .
so did i ,
until i overheard victoria &apos;s little sidekick
relaying your warning against me .
precautionary measures .
i bet .
but with you handing out $ 100,000 checks ,
it &apos;s obvious that there &apos;s more to the story
than you &apos;re telling me , and ...
now you &apos;ve got me curious .
emily .
hi .
can i talk to you ?
yeah , i was just on my way home , actually .
even better . i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll walk you .
okay .
eli ?
oh , i was hoping to catch daniel .
i wanted to introduce you to him .
actually , he just left with your neighbor .
emily thorne ?
that &apos;s the one .
what are you doin &apos; ? pervert .
she sure made a beautiful bride .
get outta here , nolan .
get out before i call the police .
you know what ? go ahead and call &apos; em , jack .
because i would tell them the same thing
that i &apos;m about to tell you .
as much as i &apos;d like to take credit
for saving your life the other night ,
that &apos;s not what happened out there .
what is this ?
a copy of the title to the speedboat
formerly known as &quot; the rose gray , &quot;
now currently renamed and registered
to one kenneth ryan .
look , if you don &apos;t believe my hacking skills ,
go to the dmv yourself tomorrow .
kenny was driving that boat ?
well , that &apos;s what the state record says .
i mean , i guess it makes sense ,
considering no one came forward to say they saved your life .
wouldn &apos;t be the first time
that the ryan brothers teamed up against you .
though maybe kenny had a crisis of conscience ?
i gotta find him .
jack , you need to let the police find him .
you have got a son and a brother
that need you alive and well .
the ryan brothers ?
don &apos;t let them take any more away from you than they already have .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry i doubted you .
i shouldn &apos;t be telling you this .
telling me what , daniel ? what is going on ?
you probably won &apos;t believe it anyway .
and here we are .
this house is the perfect spot for this .
no one knew better than david clarke
what i &apos;m going through right now .
what are you talking about ?
daniel , are you in some kind of trouble ?
the people that brought down that plane all those years ago ?
they &apos;re now forcing me to coordinate
the financing of their next plot through grayson global .
oh , my god .
have you contacted the authorities ?
no . no , no , i can &apos;t .
they &apos;ll hurt the people i care about . maybe even you . i ...
god , it &apos;s just every day i feel this--
this noose tightening around my neck .
i can hardly breathe , and i can &apos;t get out of it
without putting it around someone else &apos;s .
maybe that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna have to do .
even if it means that person
will suffer the fate that they had planned for me ?
all i care about is you .
do your parents know about this ?
know about this ?
that &apos;s the whole reason for this party tonight .
they &apos;re hiding their money in this foundation
in case there &apos;s an investigation and their assets are frozen .
are you kidding me ?
no .
then i guess i should cancel my check .
no , don &apos;t , please .
they &apos;ll suspect i told you something .
i will pay you back every cent . i promise .
just ...
please don &apos;t say a word about this to anybody .
and the king sat in his counting room
counting all his money .
while the queen was in the parlor
eating bread and boozing .
ooh . there &apos;s quite a healthy buy @-@ in from mr. james--
$ 100,000 .
the question is ,
what is it he &apos;s expecting to buy ?
did we raise enough money to form a legitimate charity ?
just shy of $ 5 million .
no one can accuse you of being an underachiever , my dear .
so have you come to berate me again for my wayward ways ?
oh , believe it or not , i &apos;m right there with you .
with your support , the board should confirm
aiden mathis by friday .
might raise a red flag if i didn &apos;t support our own cause .
make sure the treasurer knows it &apos;s tax @-@ deductible .
well , thank god he &apos;s found the fortitude
to get through this .
i have a pretty good idea where he got it .
it seems he &apos;s been cozying up to emily thorne this evening .
if he is cozying up to someone ,
you can bet trask will know about it .
well , then maybe he can help solve one of our problems .
emily .
hey , how &apos;s jack ?
well , better .
i have him convinced
that kenny ryan bought that speedboat .
good .
listen , you said that carrion can overtake any host computer .
is that true ?
oh , it &apos;s never met a firewall it couldn &apos;t level in seconds ,
without a trace .
it &apos;s marvelous , really .
but , uh , i know you didn &apos;t call
to sweet @-@ talk technology .
the graysons are planning to move their entire fortune
into the amanda clarke foundation .
if we can access that account , then we could--
bankrupt the graysons .
that is quite an achilles you &apos;ve discovered .
and tomorrow we sever it .
so how do i look ?
like someone about to go to a board induction , hopefully ?
i would say that you look the part
of both board member of a corrupt company
and treasurer for a bogus charity .
well , the latter position may not last too long ,
as conrad has me as treasurer of a swiss account
for which i seem to have lost the routing information .
oh , here . i borrowed it for nolan . sorry .
thank you .
so i take it the graysons
are well on the road towards poverty ?
assuming that nolan &apos;s software
works as well as he claims it does .
so what are you gonna do about eli ?
nothing for now .
if he exposes me , he &apos;d jeopardize
everything he stands to gain here .
he wouldn &apos;t do that .
look , i don &apos;t know if this has to do with guilt
about that childhood fire or amanda or--
it has nothing to do with amanda .
well , whatever it is ,
i don &apos;t like seeing you put yourself at risk
for a person who you owe no allegiance to whatsoever .
i do owe him .
but i understand that he &apos;s a liability .
i just need to figure out how to get him to leave
without causing any more harm .
so ... this is where aiden @-@ san &quot; waxes off . &quot;
make yourself at home .
see you later . bye .
there &apos;s been much speculation
as to who would fill my father &apos;s empty seat on the board ,
and , well ...
i &apos;m thrilled to announce the victor .
aiden mathis .
he &apos;s not only capable of helping steer this company ,
but he &apos;s got your back in bar fight , too .
an all @-@ around good bloke .
welcome aboard .
thank you , mr. grayson . good job .
so you &apos;re certain that carrion
can access the account without setting off alarms ?
she &apos;s a silent killer .
why do you think i &apos;m so anxious
about who gets their hands on her ?
watch and be amazed .
super sub @-@ net firewall ...
demolished .
ooh , dual @-@ homed gateway ...
crushed .
rotating integrated matrix--
impressive and yet ...
wait . it stopped . what happened ?
wait . let me access the mainframe &apos;s code ,
see what &apos;s tripping us up .
this can &apos;t be .
what ? what is it ?
ems ...
i &apos;ve seen this before .
all the forensic evidence ,
your e @-@ mails , the account transfers--
everything that the graysons had doctored
to have you put away
was done by someone on the payroll .
well , at first i didn &apos;t know who
until i started searching the log files .
&quot; the falcon . &quot;
he &apos;s a hacker legend .
at one point , i aspired to be him .
his only flaw--his ego .
he leaves his name in everything that he codes--
enough , nolan .
no , look , the graysons paid a lot of people
for a lot of lies .
but this is the one person
they could not have framed you without .
if i can just--
enough !
listen , i appreciate everything that you &apos;re doing .
but i can &apos;t waste my time fighting anymore .
but , david ,
this is the lead that we have been searching for .
amanda-- she set another fire .
it &apos;s worse than the last one .
she &apos;s looking at least three years in juvie .
you need to forget about me and focus on her .
she &apos;s the only thing that matters anymore .
you can &apos;t let her end up in a place like this , nolan .
when she &apos;s ready ...
i want you to make sure that she gets this .
it &apos;s her future .
i am trusting you
to make sure that she lives long enough
to have a future , nolan .
whoever wrote the code
protecting this bank account ...
is the same person that sealed your father &apos;s fate .
the man , the myth--
the falcon is back on the graysons &apos; payroll .
then let &apos;s go hunting .
