it was a nice retirement party .
i guess .
still , it &apos;s a shame
professor rothman was forced to step down .
what choice did the university have ?
he snapped .
it happens to theoretical physicists all the time .
i wonder how long sheldon &apos;s got .
these shrimp are all the same size .
there &apos;s no the logical order to eat them in .
can &apos;t be very long .
hey , look , there &apos;s rothman &apos;s empty office .
sad . mm , indeed .
yeah .
so sad .
dibs .
what &apos;s up , fellas ?
what are you doing here , kripke ?
ah , measuring my new office for drapes .
this is not your office .
it hasn &apos;t been assigned yet .
well , i called dibs at the christmas party
when professor rothman tried to have intercourse
with the toys for tots collection box .
dibs ? !
this is a university , not a playground .
offices are not assigned
because someone called dibs .
you just called dibs .
shut it .
offices are assigned by seniority .
i arrived at the university first .
i arrived at the office first .
i &apos;m the proverbial early bird .
gentlemen .
professor rothman .
good evening .
i &apos;m glad that men are wearing hats again .
they &apos;re so distinguished .
i got you a little something .
a little something ?
oh , it ...
oh , this is huge .
what &apos;s huge is what you &apos;ve done for me .
oh , no , amy , i haven &apos;t done anything .
no , no , before i met you , i was a mousy wallflower .
but look at me now .
i &apos;m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl .
with a posse , a boyfriend
and a new lace bra that hooks in the front , of all things .
open it . open it .
okay .
i wanted to get you something you didn &apos;t have .
wow !
i ... i don &apos;t know what to ...
wow .
do you like it ?
do i like it ? wow .
so , uh , where are you gonna hang it ?
oh , my god . hang it . wow .
um , you know , i &apos;d have to go get a hook
and nails and a hammer and ...
no problem .
oh , look .
you got ...
you just ... you got it all right there . wow .
i found him . he &apos;s in the bathroom .
president siebert ?
can &apos;t this wait ?
i &apos;m sorry . we just need a word .
now ?
you realize i &apos;m your boss , and i am holding my penis ?
sheldon , give the man some privacy .
i &apos;m sorry . this guy &apos;s got no respect for boundaries .
what do you want ?
will you tell this lunatic
that professor rothman &apos;s office is rightfully mine ?
can &apos;t you take this up with your department chairman ?
we tried . his assistant said he was on sabbatical .
although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut .
gentlemen , there &apos;s a task i &apos;m trying to accomplish here ,
and i &apos;m having trouble doing it .
oh , my . president siebert , i don &apos;t mean to be an alarmist ,
but difficulty initiating a urine stream
could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia .
if you &apos;re interested ,
i can send you a link to a youtube video
that &apos;ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam .
uh , helpful hint-- trim your nails first .
ignore him , president siebert .
i &apos;m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectly ...
healthy prostate .
oh , he &apos;s just trying to butter you up .
and for the record ,
butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam .
gentlemen , i &apos;m going to allow the two of you to work this out
because a. you &apos;re both brilliant scientists ,
b. as far as who gets rothman &apos;s office ,
i couldn &apos;t give the furry crack of a rat &apos;s behind .
well , as long as we &apos;re here ,
i might as well take a leak .
kripke ?
yes ?
you &apos;re in my spot .
that is big .
so big .
and ugly .
so ugly .
what am i gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
you can &apos;t take it down . you &apos;ll break her heart .
look at that face .
that enormous , unsettling , crazy face .
is there any chance i &apos;ll learn to love it ?
that depends .
do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man ?
allright , it &apos;s got to go .
what will you tell amy ?
how about i tell her
the painting makes you feel jealous
because you &apos;re not in it ?
nuh @-@ uh . what if she gets me one ?
i already have a picture of me and howard &apos;s mom
getting our hair cornrowed in venice beach .
i &apos;ve suffered enough .
well , i guess i could take it down
and put it up when she comes over , but it &apos;s kind of heavy .
oh , too bad you &apos;re not as strong as the dude in the painting .
would you look at this ?
i paid $ 25 to some kid on ebay
for a handcrafted harry potter wand .
he sent me a stick .
he went into his backyard , he picked up a stick .
it &apos;s numbered .
limited edition . nice .
oh , that &apos;ll be kripke .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
we &apos;re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen .
and if that doesn &apos;t work , i &apos;m going to poison his tea .
cooper .
kripke . come in .
i &apos;m making tea .
would you like a cup ?
am i wearing a summer frock ?
no , i don &apos;t want tea .
let &apos;s get down to brass tacks .
fine . in the interest of preserving our friendship ...
we &apos;re not friends .
well , that &apos;s a little hard to hear , but all right .
as you know , the essence of diplomacy is compromise .
with that in mind ,
i propose the following .
i will take rothman &apos;s office ,
and you will find a way to be okay with that .
how about i take rothman &apos;s office ,
and you go suck a lemon ?
you sure i can &apos;t get you that cup of tea ?
how about you decide this
with rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors lizard @-@ spock ?
what the frig is that ?
rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors @-@ lizard @-@ spock
was created by internet pioneer sam kass
as an improvement on the classic game rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors .
all hail sam kass .
hail .
how does it work ?
oh , it &apos;s very simple .
scissors cuts paper , paper covers rock ,
rock crushes lizard , lizard poisons spock ,
spock smashes scissors , scissors decapitates lizard ,
lizard eats paper , paper disproves spock ,
spock vaporizes rock ,
and as it always has , rock crushes scissors .
i &apos;m sorry . can you repeat that ?
well , of course .
scissors cuts paper , paper covers rock ,
rock crushes lizard , lizard poisons spock ,
spock smashes scissors ,
scissors decapitates lizard ,
lizard eats paper ,
paper disproves spock , spock vaporizes rock ,
and as it always has , rock crushes scissors .
almost got it . one more time .
surely . scissors cuts paper , paper covers rock , rock ...
sheldon , stop .
he &apos;s screwing with you .
is he ?
well , then ,
it seems we have reached an impasse .
i see no other option than to challenge you to a duel .
对方捡起就表示接受挑战
i &apos;d smack you with a glove ,
but just last week , i packed away my winter things .
it &apos;s the 21st century .
you can &apos;t have a duel .
h @-@ hang on , howard .
barry , how good of a shot are you ?
not pistols . minds .
a trivia contest ,
and you may choose the field of battle .
star trek trivia ,
star trek : next generation trivia ,
star trek : deep space nine trivia ,
star trek : voyager trivia ,
or model trains .
you have a complete advantage in trivia .
you have an eidetic memory .
plus , i haven &apos;t watched star trek
since i discovered the strip club near my apartment
has a free buffet .
it &apos;s gonna be hard to find something
you &apos;re both equally good at .
is there anything you &apos;re both equally bad at ?
sports .
all right , this is one @-@ on @-@ one .
first person to five wins the office . any questions ?
yes , sheldon .
five what ?
balls in the basket .
it &apos;s out , right ?
time .
ran out of room .
you know all those terrible things
bullies used to do to us ?
yeah .
i get it .
hey !
he did that on purpose !
no , he didn &apos;t .
nothing that &apos;s happening here is being done on purpose .
okay , uh , forget one @-@ on @-@ one .
let &apos;s try a free throw contest .
first person who makes a basket wins the office .
making it too easy there , hofstadter .
no . no , i &apos;m not .
use the force , sheldon .
use the force .
i &apos;m gonna need more force .
all right , cooper , prepare to have your heart broken .
do i get points for that ?
all right , we gave it 45 minutes .
it &apos;s no longer funny . let &apos;s try something else .
what do you propose ?
uh , on the count of three ,
both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can .
the highest bounce wins the office .
oh , you are going down , cooper .
i don &apos;t think so , kripke .
i &apos;ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day .
all right , that &apos;s enough trash talk .
one , two , three .
sheldon was higher .
congratulations , sheldon . you win office .
who &apos;s unsatisfactory in p.e. now ?
oh , what a great movie .
i cannot believe you &apos;ve never seen grease .
my mother didn &apos;t allow me to watch it .
she was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang .
i &apos;ve got to go .
i &apos;ve got to get up early .
my company &apos;s testing a new steroid
that supposedly doesn &apos;t shrink testicles ,
and the last one there has to do the measuring .
i guess i should get going , too .
good night , painting penny .
good night , real penny .
good night , real amy .
you don &apos;t have to say good night to painting amy ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s never leaving .
good night , real penny .
bye .
good night , transvestite penny .
okay . let us take you off the wall .
out of sight , out of mind .
i wish .
you know , can i borrow that movie ?
those singing hooligans really got my motor running .
sure , sure . enjoy .
i mean , get it back to me when you can , or ...
you know what , actually , you keep it .
it &apos;s just going to be my gift to you .
thank you .
bye .
wait ... where &apos;d the painting go ?
it &apos;s right over there .
why ?
i have no idea . that is weird .
you hate it .
no .
no , no . it &apos;s just , it &apos;s a little big .
i feel like an idiot .
no , come on , you &apos;re not an idiot .
look , just help me put it back up .
why ? so you can just take it down when i leave ?
i don &apos;t need your pity .
oh , amy , come on ...
i &apos;m just glad i didn &apos;t go for the sculpture .
ah , the spoils .
i see why victors love them .
i &apos;m happy for you , sheldon .
but i have to admit i &apos;m going to miss sharing an office with you .
oh , of course you are .
feel free to drop by any time .
thank you .
yeah . call first .
oh . hello .
professor rothman .
this isn &apos;t your office anymore .
you &apos;re retired .
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is ... &quot; invisible . &quot;
i came to say i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t bother .
oh , amy , please .
i &apos;m so humiliated .
i sat there the whole time that we were watching &quot; grease , &quot;
thinking you liked the painting .
i know .
i was a fool from &quot; summer lovin &apos; &quot; to the very last
&quot; rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong . &quot;
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re absolutely right .
i should have been honest with you
and told you the gift was too much .
yes , too much .
because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical .
i clearly like you more than you like me .
i don &apos;t think you can put a number on
how much one person likes another .
i bought you a painting that &apos;s 12 square feet in area .
there &apos;s a number .
amy , come on ...
if you don &apos;t like feet , you can try dollars .
the painting set me back three grand .
three gr ... oh , my god !
look , look , amy ,
all you need to know is , you are my friend
and i don &apos;t want to lose you out of my life .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just having trouble believing you right now .
grab your hammer .
no . damage is done .
okay , look , i didn &apos;t want to say this ,
but the real reason i took the painting down was ...
because it made bernadette very jealous .
oh , my goodness ,
how could i have not seen that ?
the painting is
a constant reminder that of the three of us ,
she is the least cool .
yeah , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s what it is , so ...
you have such a good heart .
yeah ... i try .
come on .
whoa , whoa , where are we going ?
we &apos;re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment .
well , what about bernadette ?
oh , screw her .
she &apos;s just lucky we let her hang out with us .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to raise the temperature in here
before my nipples tear through my shirt .
why don &apos;t you just turn up the thermostat ?
aha ! good question .
it turns out the thermostat for my new office
isn &apos;t in my new office . no . it &apos;s next door ,
in professor davenport &apos;s office ,
who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause .
why is there a hole here ?
why is there a hole in my new office ?
i &apos;ve narrowed it down to two possibilities :
&quot; there was something in the wall
that someone outside the wall wanted , &quot;
or the more disturbing ,
&quot; there was something in the wall that wanted out . &quot;
well , at least you finally got a window that opens .
that &apos;s nice .
is it ? listen .
what , you don &apos;t like wind chimes ?
no , i hate them , but it gets worse .
there it is .
the bird ?
it &apos;s completely out of tune with the wind chimes .
so ?
you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
that &apos;s a mockingbird .
mockingbirds can change their song ,
which means he &apos;s out of tune on purpose .
he &apos;s mocking me .
oh dear . there it is again . do you feel it ?
the growing realization
that you are one wacky bastard ? yep .
no . the vibration .
we are directly underneath the geology lab ,
and they &apos;re running their confounded sieve shakers again .
hey , gravel monkeys ,
if you need to shake rocks , try jiggling your heads around !
sheldon , relax .
how can i relax ?
my nervous system is being stretched out
like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds
and wind and the low @-@ hanging scrotum
of the difficult @-@ to @-@ evict professor rothman .
if you &apos;re not happy ,
why don &apos;t you just let kripke have the office ?
wait , and let him win ?
do i look crazy to you ?
we &apos;re trying to think down here ,
you geode @-@ loving feldspar jockeys !
and you ...
the notes are c , d , e , g and a.
you pick one or i am chopping down that tree !
how &apos;s that ?
little higher on the right .
now ?
little more .
no . that &apos;s got it .
yeah , okay . that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s good .
i &apos;ll let you in on a little secret .
originally we were painted nude .
but i had him add clothes , &apos; cause i thought
it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality .
yeah , good call .
but if you ever change your mind , all it would take
is some warm , soapy water and a couple of sponges .
you &apos;re talking about the painting , right ?
sure .
help ! somebody help !
what happened ?
i was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck .
why would you do that ?
it &apos;s called scientific curiosity !
now go get butter .
hang in there .
i &apos;ll be right back .
