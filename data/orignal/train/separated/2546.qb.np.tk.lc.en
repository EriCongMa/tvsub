the students of springfield elementary
have each created an alternative energy vehicle .
one of which will ensure the future of humanity
as determined by a short race across the parking lot .
and now , uh , what is your car powered by , uh ,
fat little boy ?
hydrogen @-@ powered fuel cells .
ah , hydrogen-- yeah , yes , wonderful .

but i don &apos;t know .
that kid &apos;s car has flames painted on the side of it .

easy , girly , don &apos;t go vanderbuckle on us .
&quot; amelia vanderbuckle lived in springfield
&quot; in the 1800s .
&quot; she was the middle child of a family of 17 .
&quot; 12 of whom died from exposure to drafty windows .
her father worked as a human canary in the poison mines . &quot;
&quot; amelia was the first
female graduate of springfield tech . &quot;
do you have to read out loud ?
i &apos;m trying to pour ants in this doll .
&quot; among other things , she was the proud inventor
of the steam @-@ powered barber chair . &quot;

i want one !
&quot; a medical board diagnosed amelia
&quot; with acute feminine overreachism and she was--
&quot; she was committed
to the springfield home for the criminally different . &quot;
whoa , the banana cabana ?
&quot; but amelia never gave up ,
&quot; continuing to work as an inventor
within the confines of the asylum . &quot;
bart , if we find those inventions ,
we can prove that amelia was scientifically significant .
pass .
listen to me .
i need to prove this woman was not a lunatic
so people will not giggle when they hear the words
&quot; woman scientist . &quot;
&quot; woman scientist . &quot;
what &apos;s next-- boy cigarette girl ?
let me ask again .
will you help me break into an abandoned insane asylum ?
abandoned asylum , where have you been all my life ?
how do we get in ?
well , i &apos;d say the best bet
is the sewer pipe .
oh , gee .
oh , come on , bart.
or this door .
bart !
the ghosts of a thousand lunatics are making me hot .
yeah , what doesn &apos;t make you hot ?
alcoholic stepfathers .
ew ! stop that !
you don &apos;t know who had that in their mouth .
sure i do-- some luno !
mmm , that &apos;s good crazy .
&quot; vanderbean , vanderbottom ,
vanderbozo-- &quot; ah , here we go--
&quot; vanderbuckle !
&quot; vanderbuckle , alfred ; vanderbuckle , alice ;
&quot; vanderbuckle , allspice ;
vanderbuckle , amelia &quot; !
a wax cylinder !
amelia recorded her voice !
though i have been locked up in this sanitarium
for lo , these many years ,
i have completed an invention that will change the world !
bart ! did you hear that ?
good evening .
because i am not taken seriously due to my gender ,
a friendly guard has hidden my invention
until a future time , when some liberated young woman
has the permission of her husband to look for it .
there &apos;s a whole closet of these things !
how many magicians do they have in this place ?
find my journal , and it will lead you
to my greatest invention !
p.s. nikola tesla might have told you he broke up with me ,
but i broke up with him .
we &apos;ve got to find that journal .
非常危险
&quot; dear diary ,

this will teach their dog to laugh at me . &quot;
whoa ! look at me ! i &apos;m enjoying reading !
guys , did you ever read something
and think it was written just for you ?
behold ... the diary of nathan little !
&quot; i pushed a vagabond under a trolley . &quot;

tap class .
chief wiggum ?
your son is dead ...

that &apos;s bad , too .
yeah , these are pages from your son &apos;s diary .
i &apos;m afraid they very clearly show him to be ...
a sociopath .
hm . well , i &apos;ve never seen bart write in cursive ,
so i &apos;m a little proud of that ,
but this is the worst thing
that &apos;s ever happened to this family .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , marge .
and ... shuffle off ,
shuffle off ,
shuffle off .
homie , i &apos;ve learned something terrible about bart.
you may want to have a drink .
way ahead of ya .
chief wiggum found these pages from our son &apos;s diary !
oh , i &apos;ve had a long day .
bart might be a sociopath .
socio @-@ what ?
&quot; someone who can &apos;t feel empathy or guilt .
they do terrible things and don &apos;t care who it hurts . &quot;
don &apos;t answer that !
it could be bart !
bart has a key .
what ? ! who gave him a key !
hey , mrs. simpson .
can bart come over
and see my grandfather &apos;s collection
of japanese swords and throwing daggers ?
aah ! why don &apos;t you play with lisa instead , hmm ?
konnichi @-@ whaaa ... ? !
hey , milhouse .
wow , this is a surprise .
i &apos;m usually sweating when we talk , but not this time .
it &apos;s amazing how you can charm and disgust me at the same time .
that &apos;s just what happens
when i &apos;m with the prettiest girl in town .
amelia &apos;s journal tells us
that her invention is buried in the basement
of the springfield suffragette society .
anyone ever tell you
you &apos;re beautiful when you &apos;re sleuthing ?
milhouse , did the hardy boys ever hit on nancy drew ?
frank did , but joe ...
let &apos;s just say there &apos;s a mystery about him .

is home to a landmark of feminist history .
do you mind if we poke around ?
the basement , eh ? yeah , that &apos;s where
we wash the ketchup off the old onion rings .

over to the fourth round of the nba draft , so get lost .

okay , i found a test online
that will tell us , once and for all ,
whether bart is a ... you know .
wait a minute !
we can &apos;t just give bart
something labeled &quot; sociopath test &quot; !
he might look it up and set us on fire with his mind !
you &apos;re right ! we need bart to think
the test is for something else .
finally ! a use for the label maker !
one of you betrayed me , and snitches lose their stitches .
sit on my banana !
why , you little ... !
where does he get this stuff ?
hey , son , your mom and i just found this quiz
you &apos;d really love to take .
&quot; are you a jet ski dude
or a motocross maestro ? &quot;
remember to answer the questions honestly .
we want to know if you meet the clinical definition
of &quot; jet ski dude . &quot;
&quot; i enjoy manipulating other people . &quot;
&quot; i believe i &apos;m being followed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes i feel as if i must injure myself or someone else . &quot;
agree , agree , agree .
&quot; sociopath . &quot;
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s what they think i am ?
fine ! i &apos;ll pretend to be the biggest sociopath in the world !
and i only need to change three answers .
is he nuts ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you think ?
i mean , he looks nuts ,
that &apos;s for sure .
so , here &apos;s your test .
call me crazy , but i enjoyed it .
well , the good news is that bart just got
his first 100 % ever on a test .
oh , my god . what do we do ?
whatever bart wants .
* crazy *
* but that &apos;s how it goes *
* millions of people *
* living as foes *
* maybe *
* it &apos;s not too late *
* to learn how to love *
* and forget how to hate *
* mental wounds not healing *
* life &apos;s a bitter shame *
* i &apos;m going off the rails *
* on a crazy train *
* i &apos;m going off the rails on a crazy train *
thanks .

i &apos;ve always hated them ,
because they wouldn &apos;t open up at 4am
to show the world caber tossing championships .
okay , willie , you can only use the jackhammer
when there &apos;s lots of noise upstairs .
no worries .
it is monday night football ,
by which i mean american football ,
by which i mean no football at all !
there &apos;s the box !
ow ! medium spicy !
ach ! we &apos;ve hit the hot sauce supply line !
i &apos;ll have to neutralize it with some signature blue cheese !
look at me ! i &apos;m a sociopath !
marge , it &apos;s time we did something .
we can take him swimming . that makes him sleepy .
not good enough . we have to call the number
at the bottom of the test .
what number ?

marge , this is for his own good .
he failed an online test .
how much more proof do you need ?
surprise ! surprise !
whoa , cool ! but wait a minute ,
my birthday &apos;s not for another two months .

children ,
form a line in order of medication
from adderall to zoloft .
you have been brought here for a purpose .
you are fearless ,
and no one can stop you .
which means you &apos;ll be of great use ...
to the u.s. military .
i expected more of a reaction .
i waited outside the door and everything .
they don &apos;t react . that &apos;s what we want .
right .
we &apos;ll be using you in the ultimate video game
to test these u.s. air force drone simulators .
man , that is a tough crowd .
mom , dad , i &apos;ve discovered the most amazing thing !
i can &apos;t wait ... um , where &apos;s bart ?
he &apos;s safe . and more importantly , we &apos;re safe .
i miss him so much .
oh . can i call him ?
you can call his guard , tico .
he picks up sometimes .
i see .
okay , i &apos;ll do that .
homie , where did we go wrong ?
i don &apos;t know , sweetie . i don &apos;t know .
we did everything we could for him during the commercials .
and we &apos;re live
as lisa simpson prepares to prove
that springfield embarrassment
amelia vanderbuckle deserves to be
in the female scientific pantheon ,
along with marie curie and , uh ,
you know , uh , um ,
velma from scooby @-@ doo .
thank you all for coming out
to support a woman &apos;s place in history !
that &apos;s what this is ?
i thought it was a green bay packers rally .
all right , you know what , this ain &apos;t coming off .
behold , the masterpiece of amelia vanderbuckle .
a loom ? !
that isn &apos;t science .
that &apos;s home economics .
everyone , storm the stage !
not so fast !
this is no ordinary loom !
even an extraordinary loom
is the most boring thing i could think of .
this is much , much more than just a loom .
it &apos;s alive ! and polite !
&quot; operand &quot; ? looks like it wants us to give it a math problem .
oh , my god . oh , god !
it &apos;s the first computational device !
people , people , don &apos;t you see ?
the board acts like punch cards
and the loom like a computer ,
with the charles babbage and the john von neumann ...
let &apos;s have the square root of nine cheers for lisa !
lisa ! lisa ! lisa !
you see that , bart ? you see what your sister did ?
yeah , yeah , great .
listen , i &apos;m in a simulator ,
so i can &apos;t really talk .
and you know i &apos;m a sociopath ,
so i &apos;m just going through the motions here .
i love you .
i was just saying that to myself .
have a smart bomb , stupid .
nice not knowin &apos; ya .
all targets destroyed .
simulation complete .
you are impressive .
even though i &apos;m the only real person in the world ,
and , therefore , i created you in my imagination .
children , your empty souls and flying fingers
are very impressive , and i can tell you now
that was no simulation .
you mean we were blowing up real stuff ?
that &apos;s right-- convoys , terrorist training camps ,
suspicious weddings , kabul starbucks .
cool ! awesome . i knew it !
no , i thought it was a video game .
i don &apos;t want to hurt real people .
oh , i want to go home .
please ?
how disappointing .
does anyone else share the human boy &apos;s feelings ?
son , the truth is the simulators we told you
weren &apos;t simulators were simulators .
now , i &apos;m sorry , bart ,
but you are a healthy , normal boy .
we &apos;re sending you home .
really ? oh , wow . dudes , it &apos;s been real .
although , actually , it was all a fake .
i &apos;ll never forget you , bart simpson .

my little guy is back !
and i &apos;m not bad ! i just made bad decisions .
it &apos;s okay , boy .
you started out life as a bad decision .
the best bad decision i ever made .
and i restored the reputation
of a scientist from 100 years ago .
and maggie tried strawberries for the first time .
what a day ! what a day !
okay , lisa , go ahead and say it .
don &apos;t be ashamed .
i &apos;m immortal !

oh , i &apos;d love to , but there &apos;s a huge crowd here
at the science of thor exhibit .
hey , tour ! want to see a great invention and its plaque ?
we &apos;re just passing through to the cafe .
double @-@ time , tour .
how &apos; bout you , sir ?
je ne parle pas l &apos;anglais .
