how &apos;d i let you talk me into another round , huh ?
come on .
we need to decompress .
yeah , decompression is for the day after the special election ,
especially when your guy only has a two @-@ point lead .
when are you gonna take it out of fifth gear ?
people are still getting used to the idea
that senator chang died in office .
they &apos;ll warm up to our guy ,
once the shock wears off .
yeah , maybe . maybe you &apos;re right .
what &apos;s the plan for tomorrow ?
debate prep , campaign rally downtown ,
fund @-@ raiser , and then in the evening
there &apos;s a cocktail party
for some big @-@ money supporters .
whoa , this thing is really moving at warp speed .
yeah , you know it .
well , the saving grace is that it will all be over ...
in two weeks .
yeah , and then we &apos;ll either be looking
for apartments in dc or job hunting .
cheers .
okay , okay , okay , you convinced me .
i &apos;m gonna go back to the office , crunch some more numbers .
being around all these beautiful people having a good time ,
that &apos;s just ...
not the greatest motivator .
and i &apos;m saying good night .
oh , sorry . good night .
what , are you sticking around ?
yeah . yeah , i think i &apos;m gonna , uh , decompress a little more .
decompress . sweet .
i will , uh , see you bright and early .
bright and early .
bright .
and early .
belvedere dirty martini .
from the gentleman at the end of the bar .
hey , handsome .
please ...
please don &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t do this .
i swear to you i told you everything i knew .
please ...
i believe you .
you , uh , you look ,
uh , very nice-- suit and tie ; that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s for you . wore it for you . thank you .
all right .
hey , hey , what are you doing ?
is that a clip @-@ on ?
it &apos;s not a clip @-@ on . are you ...
what &apos;d i just say to you ?
your tie &apos;s all jacked up-- can i fix it , please ?
come here . come here . come here .
thought nobody wore a tie in hawaii .
no , they don &apos;t , but , you know , it &apos;s a special day ,
so i thought i &apos;d wear one .
&apos;course , i &apos;m wearing my dress blues .
they &apos;d make me walk the plank
if i don &apos;t wear a tie with the dress blues .
how come the blues are black ?
i know they &apos;re black ; i don &apos;t know why ...
thank you very much for being here-- it means a lot .
okay ?
you &apos;re welcome .
you &apos;d do the same for me .
all right , you ready ?
yeah , i &apos;m good . i got , uh ...
the speech all prepared , everything &apos;s ...
good .
good .
tell you something , they take her away from me ,
i &apos;m jumping off a cliff today .
that &apos;s not gonna happen , okay ?
okay .
danny .
okay .
all right ?
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
that &apos;s not gonna happen all right ?
in the matter of williams vs. edwards ,
where are we ?
your honor , my client has prepared a statement
he &apos;d like to read into the record .
go ahead .
excuse me .
sorry .
&quot; your honor , uh ...
i , uh , i come before you today ... &quot;
okay , i &apos;m sorry . can i start over ?
thank you . &quot; uh , your honor ...
i come ... &quot;
that sucks .
detective williams , why are you littering my courtroom ?
i apologize . i really apologize , your honor .
but ... um , i was prepared to give my speech
to rachel , my ex , but she &apos;s ...
she &apos;s not here .
weren &apos;t you told that your statement
should be addressed to this court ?
yes , i was , i was , but ...
i know how busy a family court judge can be ,
right , presiding over cases much bigger ,
more serious than mine .
so i thought that i would appeal directly to rachel .
go on .
okay . um ...
okay , look , i , um ...
i had a pretty good life
in new jersey , uh , and then ...
i came here .
and it wasn &apos;t exactly a fit .
uh , the sun ... sand--
i mean , i can &apos;t even get a decent slice of pizza .
get to your point , detective williams .
okay , i hate this place .
uh ... i apologize , but i do .
but i was willing to put up with it ,
because this is where my daughter is .
and now her mother wants to move again ,
and i @-@ i can &apos;t go through with that .
not to vegas , not anywhere ,
because this ... is my home .
this is our ...
home .
your honor , that little girl is @-@ is my everything .
she is my life , she is my breath .
and it may just be the two of us ,
but we ... are a family .
and separating us by two thousand seven hundred and fifty @-@ four miles
of water is not ... something this court should allow .
detective , weren &apos;t you recently shot
in the presence of your daughter ?
i can ... i can explain that , your honor .
commander mcgarrett , this is not your forum .
yes , i know that , your honor ,
and i &apos;m sorry , but ...
detective williams doesn &apos;t just work for me--
he &apos;s my friend ,
he &apos;s my close friend-- and , uh ...
i &apos;ve seen him with his daughter .
he &apos;s a great father .
he &apos;s actually the kind of father we all wish we had .
i &apos;m so sorry . i have to take this call .
yes , governor ?
she was found like that
in a mansion in kahala .
we got an i.d. ?
hpd is still working on it .
but here are the preliminaries .
all right . we &apos;ll do everything we can to help , sir .
i don &apos;t want you to help , commander-
i want you and your five @-@ o task force to take over the case .
and i need it cleared quickly .
well , uh , hpd homicide is very good ...
and i need it done quietly .
yes , sir .
if i may ask , what brought this case to your attention ?
the people who own the house
are friends of mine , close friends .
very dear friends .
i &apos;d like the matter to remain private .
okay , well , i &apos;ll need to talk to them .
you can &apos;t .
why not ?
they &apos;re trekking in nepal ; completely unreachable .
i &apos;ll need to confirm that , sir .
i &apos;m confirming it for you right now .
keep me in the loop , commander .
i want constant updates .
and don &apos;t go through the office .
call my cell directly .
understood , sir .
all right , send him in .
hold on , let me get this straight .
is this official business , or is this a favor ?
what difference does it make ?
well , it makes a very big difference ,
you see , because official business is , uh , official .
a favor is like a quid pro quo kind of deal , right ?
you ... solve this murder case for me ,
and i will give you , uh , oh , five days &apos; paid vacation .
right ? or tickets to monster truck jam , or whatever .
monster truck jam &apos;s not in town .
okay , so then it is , indeed , official business .
exactly .
exac ... ? wh @-@ what ...
none of this seems strange to you ?
hold on . none of this seems , uh , in the slightest bit off ?
i mean , what are these homeowners ?
they , uh , big contributors
to the governor &apos;s campaign , or what ?
i have no idea .
and we can &apos;t talk to them ?
danny , is there a point coming anytime soon ?
absolutely .
it seems to me like we &apos;re taking a case
just to protect the governor &apos;s friends .
we &apos;re the governor &apos;s task force .
then why does it feel like we are
performing janitorial services , blindfolded , i might add .
we &apos;ve been given a directive , danny .
oh , right , i understand .
when mcgarrett gets an order , he takes the order .
you know what you &apos;re like ?
you &apos;re like one of those windup toy soldiers .
let me get you a drum for christmas to beat .
the last time we butted heads with denning ,
he sent lori home .
i don &apos;t want to see what he &apos;s got planned for an encore , do you ?
okay , here are some basics .
the homeowners &apos; names are wendy and patrick duggan .
i checked into their passport records .
they landed in katmandu last week .
according to their itinerary , they &apos;re halfway into their hike .
well , confirms what governor denning told us .
how do you think the cell service is on everest ?
i can &apos;t imagine it &apos;s too good .
we got any signs of forced entry ?
no .
other than the duggans , the caretaker &apos;s the only one
who claims to have a set of keys .
hpd checked his alibi .
it &apos;s airtight .
max give us a cod ?
he hasn &apos;t posted the vic yet , but based on
the bruising around her neck , he &apos;s thinking she was strangled .
maybe it was a crime of passion , right ?
killer &apos;s having sex with the vic ,
then he gets a little rough ,
things spin out of control .
you got anything else ?
yeah . max found traces of a powdery substance
around her left clavicle .
he sent it over to fong for processing .
i got an i.d. on our vic .
her name is serena andrews .
hpd had her in their database .
what was she cited for ?
solicitation .
houston , we &apos;ve got a problem .
so we have a working girl killed in a kahala mansion
belonging to good friends of the governor .
two questions : did the governor know her ,
and did he know that she was a prostitute ?
and if he did , is he involved ?
you like the way this is going ?
no , i don &apos;t .
serena didn &apos;t make it home last night .
not exactly a big deal .
so she often stays out all night ?
look , i &apos;m her roommate , not her mother .
but she is a friend of yours ?
yeah .
how long you guys been here ?
six months .
mollie , do you know that serena was cited for solicitation ?
that was over a year ago .
what about you-- you ever been busted ?
i &apos;m a student .
pretty pricey place .
student loans cover this ?
i don &apos;t like what you &apos;re insinuating .
i &apos;m not insinuating ; i &apos;m asking .
what &apos;s an all @-@ night trick go for these days-- two , three grand ?
what i do with my body is my business .
and when a body shows up dead ,
it &apos;s ours .
oh , my god .
she was found dead at 3500 hunukai street in kahala .
do you know that address ?
no .
truth .
look , serena didn &apos;t usually work with locals , okay ?
just high @-@ end tourists or conventioneers .
how did she hook up with the johns ?
there &apos;s this thing called the internet .
maybe you &apos;ve heard of it .
where &apos;s your laptop ?
so , if we can find the last john serena booked ,
it could lead back to our killer .
her clientele wouldn &apos;t use their real names , though , would they ?
probably not .
then again , the guys we &apos;re dealing with
usually aren &apos;t thinking with their heads .
not the big one anyway .
okay , okay , copy that .
let &apos;s just get serena &apos;s laptop over to fong
and see if he can trace the last ip address .
that could be a while .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
black suv two cars back-- you see it ?
oh , hello .
yeah , it &apos;s been tailing us for the last two miles .
yeah , okay , thanks , max .
tod on serena andrews
was between 11 : 00 and 12 : 00 last night .
max just confirmed that she had sexual intercourse
just prior to the murder .
so there &apos;s dna .
max just put a rush order on it .
lab should have some answers any time soon .
i just got off the phone with the lab .
did we get a hit ?
i don &apos;t know .
you just said you got off the phone with the lab .
i did , yeah , and they told me they are on strict orders
not to rush the testing .
orders from whom ?
governor denning &apos;s office .
suv &apos;s still on us .
that &apos;s three straight lefts .
doubt they &apos;re looking for a parking spot .
how do you want to play it ?
hold on .
five @-@ o ! get out of the car now !
hey , hey !
what the hell was all that about ?
i don &apos;t know , but did you catch the plates ?
&quot; g &quot; ride , yeah , government issue .
commander , commander ,
you cannot go in there .
am i running this investigation or not ?
give us a minute , please .
don &apos;t ever do that again .
why &apos;d you ask me to take over this case
if you &apos;re going to interfere ?
there is a chain of command here ,
and you &apos;re not anywhere near the top .
there is a state vehicle surveilling my team .
sir , the lab can &apos;t process the dna on your orders .
why are you blocking every move i make ?
my orders are not subject to your scrutiny , commander .
what the hell are you hiding , governor ?
just what the hell are you implying ?
the dead girl-- you knew she was a prostitute .
the dna we found on the body-- is it yours ?
no .
is it yours , governor ?
no !
no , i did not know the victim was a prostitute ,
and no , it is not my dna .
i don &apos;t know what to believe here , sir .
when i run that dna ...
who is it going to trace back to ?
chris freed .
congressman christopher freed ?
yes , our soon- to @-@ be senator .
i don &apos;t understand .
politics , commander , plain and simple .
protect your flank at all costs .
protect your ass is what you mean .
chris freed and i go a long way back .
i told him i &apos;d help out any way i can .
he needed a place in town to stay ,
i knew these party donors who were away ,
so i arranged it for him to stay at their house--
the same house serena andrews &apos; body was found in .
okay , why didn &apos;t you tell me the truth
when you handed me the case ?
because a scandal like this could ruin a good man &apos;s life
and his chances of being elected .
you didn &apos;t think i was gonna find out ?
i was hoping to contain your findings as they came in ,
determine if they were credible .
if they were , act accordingly .
you have to understand ,
chris freed is a medal of honor recipient ,
chairman of the veteran affairs committee .
and now he &apos;s a suspect in a homicide investigation .
he is also my friend , commander .
we served together .
of all people , you know what that means .
and , may i add ,
he is also a devoted single father ,
so i wanted to be damn sure
that the facts were straight before we rip his life apart .
with all due respect ...
... we just found a dead prostitute in his bed .
so i have to ask you-- as his friend ,
i have got to ask you ...
do you think it &apos;s possible
congressman freed could have killed this woman ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay , you know what we call this in police work ?
what ?
a complete and total waste of time .
just listen to me .
anybody knows where the congressman is ,
it &apos;s going to be his press secretary .
he &apos;s not gonna tell us anything .
these people lie for a living-- you know that , right ?
this guy .
all right , we got anything over there ?
excuse me , josh lowry ?
i &apos;ll have to call you back .
uh , yeah , who are you ?
steve mcgarrett .
this is detective danny williams .
we &apos;re with five @-@ o.
hey , we &apos;re looking for congressman freed .
yeah , five @-@ o , thank you guys for coming down ,
and you know
the congressman is a huge supporter of the law enforcement community .
uh , can we get you guys anything-- coffee or water ?
no , we &apos;re good , we just want a minute with the congressman .
yeah , you know what ?
i @-@ i wish you guys had called .
i could have saved you the trouble .
due to the accelerated campaign schedule ,
the congressman-- he &apos;s , he &apos;s wall @-@ to @-@ wall today ,
guys , he &apos;s very busy .
very busy .
yeah , slammed actually ,
but i &apos;m sure i can answer any questions
you guys might have on the issues .
i @-@ i have a question , actually .
yeah , maybe you could tell us ,
what &apos;s the congressman &apos;s position
on dead hookers found in his bed ?
strangled dead hookers .
um , you know , why don &apos;t we , uh ,
why don &apos;t we speak in private ?
sure .
no , there &apos;s no way .
there &apos;s got to be some kind of mistake .
the congressman would never get involved with a prostitute .
his stand on the exploitation of sex workers is very clear ,
and as far as murder goes ...
let me guess , he &apos;s completely against it .
do you even know the congressman ?
uh , about as much as you can know somebody in a 15 @-@ second sound bite .
okay . all i &apos;m saying is , spend ten minutes with the man .
you &apos;d be absolutely convinced
at how outrageous your accusations are .
now , if this country had more men like congressman freed ...
there &apos;d be a chicken in every pot
and a dead ho in every bed , right ?
look , uh , i &apos;ve been with him since his days in the state house .
okay ?
i &apos;m not saying he &apos;s perfect but pretty damn close ,
and the mere suggestion
that he could be possibly involved in something like this
is incredibly insulting to him , to his family ,
and to his legacy .
okay , that is a , a beautiful speech .
okay , where is he ?
look , mr. lowry ,
if the congressman is as big on law enforcement as you say ,
then you understand , we have to do our job .
now , where is he ?
we &apos;re not going to ask you again .
geez . ah , boy .
we &apos;ve been spinning all morning to cover for him .
oh , you don &apos;t even know where he is ?
no , we don &apos;t .
you didn &apos;t think to tell anybody ?
look , the political reality is this :
the special election is a nail @-@ biter .
we haven &apos;t had any time to campaign .
now , any little thing could tip the scales .
now , if news got out that freed was off the grid ,
yeah , let &apos;s just say that &apos;d be bad .
no , no , i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;d be bad .
bad would be &quot; breaking news story :
congressman freed , suspect in a homicide . &quot;
josh , level with us .
all right , where do you think he is ?
all i can think is that he and amy are somewhere , holed up ,
prepping for the debate .
who &apos;s amy ?
amy davidson-- she &apos;s freed &apos;s chief of staff ,
one of his closest confidants .
she runs the campaign .
well , where is she , josh ?
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t , i really don &apos;t .
i &apos;m assuming with him .
so , if i &apos;m congressman freed
in the middle of a special election ,
and something goes wrong ...
who &apos;s the first person you call ?
my chief of staff amy davidson .
right , so you can get together and plan an alibi .
any luck pinging the congressman &apos;s phone ?
no , no signal .
okay , well , try amy &apos;s .
chances are , we find one , we find the other .
hey , steve , hold on , kono &apos;s got something .
you guys aren &apos;t gonna believe this .
the lab finally processed
the dna from the dead girl .
they got a hit .
congressman freed ?
no .
then who is it ?
the match came back from the national database to a ryan webb .
he &apos;s an associate professor of english from ohio .
he &apos;s in town for a mystery writers convention .
what &apos;s a teacher doing in the system ?
he &apos;s employed at a state school .
they require dna for background checks .
uh , the ip address from the hotel
matched serena &apos;s last appointment .
according to the hotel ,
he &apos;s scheduled to check out this morning .
i got it .
here , here , let me help you with those bags .
what is this ? who are you ?
five @-@ o. we &apos;re extending your stay .
hope you had a nice visit .
please , this is all a colossal mistake .
i honestly have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
a mistake ? well , why don &apos;t you help me understand ?
where &apos;s the congressman ?
congressman who ?
congressman freed of the great state of hawaii .
is that supposed to mean something to me ? i ...
party last night , remember ? mansion in kahala ?
last night ?
last night , i @-@ i was on an elmore leonard panel ,
and a bunch of us went to the room to watch get shorty .
yeah , you left the part out about the dead prostitute .
what ? no . no , no , no .
obviously , fiction isn &apos;t your strong suit , professor ,
&apos;cause we have your dna ,
and it puts you in bed with the hooker
at the congressman &apos;s house .
look , look , come on .
i &apos;m just an english teacher , okay ?
i don &apos;t know anything about a congressman ,
and i didn &apos;t kill anybody !
nice wedding ring , by the way .
how long you been married ?
wait a minute .
maybe your wife in ohio knows where you were last night .
let &apos;s give her a call , see what she got to say then .
wait , wait , wait .
serena was alive when i left her .
well , how did you wind up with the congressman ?
i didn &apos;t .
okay , the girl and i-- we never left the bar .
bar ? what bar ?
have you ever been to lima , ohio ?
i mean , come on . this is hawaii .
i @-@ i just wanted to have fun .
so , i @-@ i found this web site , and serena--
she agreed to meet me at the liki tiki lounge .
wait a minute . you &apos;re telling me you had sex with her at the bar ,
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
when @-@ when she showed up , well ...
... we @-@ we did it in the bathroom .
i &apos;ve always wanted to do that . back in lima ...
then what ?
then @-@ then she left .
what time was that ?
about @-@ about 10 : 00 .
what did you do after that ?
i stayed and had a few more drinks .
same bar ?
yeah . no . if you don &apos;t believe me ,
you can check my credit card , okay ?
i ran a tab , and i cashed out at last call .
bartender confirms seeing serena andrews
leaving the liki tiki lounge around 10 : 00 .
well , what about webb ?
credit card checks out . he closed the place .
okay , so , 10 : 00 was the last time anybody saw serena alive .
mm @-@ hmm , and with tod set between 11 : 00 and 12 : 00 ...
there &apos;s no way webb could have killed her .
we &apos;re back to square one .
not exactly . just got a call from our friend josh lowry .
looks like freed &apos;s chief of staff , amy davidson ,
just walked into campaign headquarters .
josh , where &apos;s amy davidson ?
she &apos;s inside with powers .
brad powers . that &apos;s , uh , freed &apos;s opponent .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
well , he came by to discuss the ground rules of the debate
with the congressman , i was handling the situation .
then all of a sudden , amy shows up .
picks up right where she left off ,
like nothing even happened .
did she say where she was ?
no , she didn &apos;t .
she went behind closed doors with powers ,
they &apos;ve been in there ever since .
josh , you disappoint me .
i don &apos;t know what kind of campaign you &apos;re running here ,
but i don &apos;t buy amy &apos;s spin for a minute .
we &apos;re not spinning anything , mr. powers .
really ? then what &apos;s five @-@ o doing here ?
that &apos;s between us and the congressman , sir .
yeah , well , when you see him , please ask him
why he blew me off last night without so much as a phone call .
what time were you supposed to meet him ?
11 : 00 .
i &apos;ve know chris freed for 15 years .
he &apos;s never pulled a stunt like that .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a misunderstanding , sir .
he said he wanted to run a civil campaign ,
one with mutual respect and all of that .
this is a hell of a way to show it .
i don &apos;t know what you people are hiding ,
but i &apos;m gonna find out ,
and when i do , so will the press .
okay . we need to speak to amy now .
amy ?
i got five @-@ o here . they need to talk to you .
miss davis ,
where &apos;s congressman freed ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i think he might have done something terrible .
don &apos;t you think i &apos;d help you guys if i could ?
i just don &apos;t know where he is right now .
okay , so , you-- where have you been ?
i was out ... looking for him .
look , you don &apos;t get it .
this is complicated .
then speak slowly , all right ?
because i need to understand
why a man like congressman freed
would risk everything
to get serviced by a prostitute .
to tell you the truth , i brought her to meet the congressman .
that &apos;s a smart move .
why &apos;d you do that ?
doesn &apos;t happen all the time , but he &apos;s under a lot of stress ,
and he &apos;s a single father ,
so he &apos;s on his own .
i mean , besides his daughter , there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s really no one else in his life .
so sometimes he just needs
a little companionship for the evening .
so you &apos;re chief of staff and part @-@ time madam for him ?
come on , the guy &apos;s human .
all right , amy , i have to ask you .
to the best of your knowledge ,
has the congressman ever hurt any of the women he &apos;s been with ?
rough stuff doesn &apos;t seem to be his thing ,
but you know , who knows
what goes on behind closed doors ?
okay , well , something happened last night .
where did you find serena andrews ?
picked her up at a place called the liki tiki lounge ,
and i dropped her off at the mansion in kahala .
no , you delivered her
to the congressman , like a pizza .
yes .
what about the congressman &apos;s 11 : 00 with powers ?
why did he blow that off ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s why i went back to the mansion .
but when i got there , he was gone ,
and i found the girl in the bed .
and being the pragmatic political operative that you are ,
you decided to go to the governor instead of the police ?
because i knew they were friends ,
and i needed time to think .
to plan a cover @-@ up .
no !
no . look , something like this has national repercussions .
okay , you need to have a viable strategy .
what time did you pick up serena andrews ?
9 ... 9 : 15 ?
she was right on time .
am i under arrest ?
amy might be a good chief of staff ,
but she &apos;s a terrible liar .
all right , the professor was shot
and now serena in a bathroom stall at 9 : 15 .
she didn &apos;t leave the bar till 10 : 00 .
you &apos;re right .
if i &apos;m right , then why isn &apos;t she under arrest ?
&apos;cause we still have to find the congressman ,
and if he &apos;s on the run ,
chances are he &apos;s gonna reach out to her .
so let &apos;s sit on her phone ,
post a surveillance team at her door .
exactly , and let freed come to us .
the thing i want to know is , why is amy lying ?
what do you got ?
that powdery substance max found on the body ?
ir spectroscopy identified it as cornstarch .
cornstarch ?
specifically , the type used in surgical gloves .
it makes them easier to pull on and off .
that explains ... why we didn &apos;t find any prints
belonging to our killer .
that does not sound like a crime of passion .
that definitely sounds like the killing was premeditated .
so , why would the congressman plan
on killing a prostitute he just met ?
unless he knew her previously .
or there &apos;s something we &apos;re not seeing here .
or unless he didn &apos;t do it .
so , i traced amy davidson &apos;s timeline .
guess what ?
doesn &apos;t add up .
ah , she was lying .
very shocking .
she said she picked up serena andrews
from the liki tiki lounge at 9 : 15 .
but when i ran her credit cards ,
it turned out , she was having drinks
at another place called the ocean lounge .
by herself ?
she bought two rounds .
two drinks each time .
who she was with ?
josh lowry ,
congressman &apos;s press secretary . he confirmed it .
said they were having a strategy session .
he also confirmed
that they didn &apos;t leave the place together .
according to a bartender i spoke to ,
she left with an unknown male companion .
we need a positive id on that companion .
it &apos;s gonna be tough .
no security footage from the bar .
i found an atm camera across the street .
nice .
only thing is , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s a clear shot of the exit .
not so nice .
okay , easy . what it did give us was a shot
of a police cruiser pulling someone over near the club entrance .
huh . we got a dashboard cam ?
yeah , we have a dashboard cam ,
and i have footage coming through right now .
that &apos;s amy . freeze , kono . freeze that .
can you push in ?
looks like she &apos;s with someone .
it &apos;s wo fat . he &apos;s still on the island .
what the hell is he doing with amy ?
he &apos;s using amy davidson to set up congressman freed .
set up for what ?
think about it .
who stands to gain
if congressman freed takes a hard fall ?
his opponent , brad powers .
wo fat sees this special election as an opening .
he &apos;s on the run , he &apos;s got no resources .
what better way to rebuilt your empire
than to buy a politician ?
right , by discrediting freed ,
powers definitely gets the senate seat .
and wo fat gets a friend in washington .
quid pro quo .
not on our watch .
i am so ashamed . sorry .
please forgive me .
you need to start writing .
go to hell .
i expected a more dignified response from a congressman .
cut me loose , and i &apos;ll show you how dignified i can can be
when i pound the crap out of you .
you &apos;re not thinking this through .
why should i sign the equivalent of a suicide note ?
that &apos;d be the end of my career , my life .
even if i sign it , you &apos;re going to kill me anyway .
a homegrown treasure like you ?
a bona fide war hero ?
no .
i have too much respect for your accomplishments .
however ...
my affections
don &apos;t extend to your daughter .
where is he ?
excuse me ?
wo fat . where is he ?
we know you left the bar with him .
okay , you need to leave .
i don &apos;t think you understand who you &apos;re dealing with .
no , i said , you need to leave .
everything you &apos;ve said up to this point is a lie .
all right , the congressman with prostitutes ,
you bringing &apos; em to him , all of it .
okay , i can &apos;t talk to you guys about this right now .
get this through your head , okay ?
if freed &apos;s not dead already , wo fat will kill him .
you understand what i &apos;m saying ?
you can stop this .
you can stop all of this , but you have to start talking to us .
where is congressman freed ?
where is he , amy ?
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t shush me . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i did it because he said he was gonna kill me .
listen to me ,
where is he keeping the congressman hostage ?
i don &apos;t know !
amy ...
i really don &apos;t know .
get down . amy , get down !
i don &apos;t see him , steve .
everybody , get down ! get down ! get down ! get down !
there goes our lead to the congressman .
what is that ?
wo fat ?
hey , chin , we need a trace right away .
i &apos;m sorry , congressman .
looks like there &apos;s been a change in plans .
geez , brah . you scared me .
i thought you was a pig .
think of how much easier this could &apos;ve been
if you had just signed that letter .
get lower to the ground !
come on , come on . go closer !
grab his leg !
come on !
come on !
he &apos;s hit ! let &apos;s go ! come on !
how bad is it ?
bad ! we need a hospital right now ! go !
wo fat , danny !
forget it , let &apos;s go !
forget it !
let &apos;s go !
come on !
come on !
so , how &apos;s the congressman ?
no major organs were hit , just soft tissue damage .
he &apos;s gonna be all right .
all right .
what about wo fat ?
the entire department is searching the jungle .
got a perimeter set up ,
helicopter in the air , everything .
you find anything in the abandoned house ?
yeah , a cell phone .
wo fat left it-- must &apos;ve been in a rush
to chase down the congressman .
and judging by the call log , looks like we were right .
he was trying to buy himself a powerful ally .
thank you .
thank you . thank you so mu ...
nice to see you again , mr. powers .
relax .
what the hell are you doing ?
bad taste in friends , buddy .
bradley powers ,
you &apos;re under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder .
would you please stop ?
please . we didn &apos;t have a choice .
we had to let wo fat go .
and we are going to find him . i promise . okay ?
you mind if i join you guys ?
hey . of course , governor .
sit , sit . we &apos;re not on the clock .
oh , uh , i got to take this . sit down , please .

what &apos;s the occasion ?
powers cracked under questioning .
he admitted he was in bed with wo fat .

he almost pulled that one off , huh ?
i owe you .

no .
you went above and beyond , commander .
and ...

trust- it , um ...
well , it &apos;s a mighty big word .
yeah , it is .

drinking beer with you .
all right , fire away and don &apos;t hold back .
i got a lot of respect for you , sir .
got a lot of respect for the office .
but if this thing between us
is gonna work out then ...
honesty is the best policy .
your predecessor , she didn &apos;t believe in that and , uh ...
well , it got her killed .
well ...
that was her . this is me .

that your courtroom behavior was completely unacceptable and despicable ,
