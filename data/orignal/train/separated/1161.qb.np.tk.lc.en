isn &apos;t that garrett &apos;s car ?
i think it is .
where &apos;s he going ?
dad , why are you in jason &apos;s house ?
spencer deserves some answers .
but not your damn business .
college will be a great experience for you .
you &apos;ll look back and realize
just how naive you were .
really ?
what is that ?
liquid courage .
want some ?
hit me .
kate was drinking , too .
kate is not drunk .
kate just gave a very touching toast alone !
you &apos;re done .
give me the
what are you doing ?
let go ! stop it !
are you okay ?
when your father gets home ,
this did not happen .
hello , maya .
hello , emily .
you didn &apos;t come all this way to see melissa , did you ?
why don &apos;t we continue this over coffee ?
wren . i have a boyfriend now .
fine . how about tea ?
i don &apos;t remenber the thing from the night ali died .
i woke up the next morning with this .
here is the summary page .
what does it say ?
alison was buried alive .
where &apos;s page five ?
look , here &apos;s page 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ... page 6 .
where the hell is page 5 ?
doctor sullivan .
can you get ahold of the other girls
and come to my office now ?
i know who &quot; a &quot; is .
she &apos;s not here .
&quot; the doctor is out .
a &quot;
they &apos;ve been like this since we brought them in here .
haven &apos;t said a word .
you know , there &apos;s
probably a promotion in this for you .
you &apos;re right all along .
they &apos;re guilty .
and now we can prove it .
did you miss me ?
this isn &apos;t a little bad . it is bad .
homicide is capital offence taken in pennsylvania .
and you girls are going down .
dr. sullivan , are you home ?
you &apos;ve reached anne sullivan .
i &apos;ve been called out of town on a family emergency .
if you need immediate attention ,
please see your physician for a referral .
i got the same voicemail .
yeah , she probably sent it to all of her clients .
she &apos;s not here .
looks like she didn &apos;t come home last night either .
she hasn &apos;t checked her mail or picked up her papers .
maybe we should call the police .
and say what to officer garrett when he starts asking questions ?
hanna &apos;s right .
garrett , jenna , ian , jason--
they &apos;re all connected , and we can &apos;t trust any of them .
look , the last time somebody thought she knew who &quot; a &quot; was ,
she got hit by a car . sorry , hanna .
okay , so what do we do ?
we go into terror alert red
and hope that our phones don &apos;t ring .
that did not just happen !
it &apos;s maya .
look at you , suddenly all happy .
so , was it , like , nonstop &quot; just say no &quot;
and sunset sing @-@ alongs ?
i will admit to knowing all the words
to &quot; what a friend we have in jesus , &quot;
but i also met a lot of cool people there .
cool like the osmonds ?
go with the gold .
and cool like you don &apos;t end up at true north
because you &apos;re a conformist .
you know , i heard that they make you look at pictures ...
hanna , i love you ,
but i haven &apos;t had a chance to talk to maya ...
alone .
oh , this is a date !
it &apos;s not a date .
it &apos;s not a date .
and i &apos;m the clueless goober .
okay , look , i &apos;m really happy that you &apos;re back ,
and i hope that we ...
okay , are those this season ?
we &apos;ll ... talk later .
sure . and i hope the wedding goes better than the rehearsal .
well , i can &apos;t imagine how it could be any worse .
it &apos;s sweet that you guys are going with her .
we &apos;ve been through a lot together .
you have great friends .
i kind of think that &apos;s where we need to start again .
you ... just want to be friends ?
no . i &apos;m not saying that .
so much has happened , and ...
i don &apos;t know ... this , emily .
i @-@ i think you &apos;ll like her .
i know i will , but ...
i want to make sure she still likes me .
i want you to know that i &apos;m thrilled you called me .
i should have called you first .
you should &apos;ve .
but i forgive you .
thank you . i &apos;ll pick it up in an hour .
what did the mechanic say ?
the brake fluid was low .
what ? !
how did that even happen ?
you treat that truck like it &apos;s your baby .
the brake line was severed .
i probably backed over something at work .
you were just lucky you weren &apos;t on the highway .
if we had a real baby ,
what would it look like ?
i &apos;m picturing a newborn with a six @-@ pack .
looks like jason &apos;s taking down his window treatments .
he spends a lot of time in alison &apos;s room .
yeah , well , maybe he likes the view .
so , your dad didn &apos;t tell you anything about last night ?
why would your dad be over there ?
like i said , he just wouldn &apos;t tell me .
and that was the end of the conversation ?
yeah .
spencer .
i know you .
when you want answers , you get them .
yeah , well , you might know me ,
but you don &apos;t know my dad ,
and when he tells me to mind my own business ,
that &apos;s what i do ,
so can you just get over it ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just , that &apos;s who he is .
and you &apos;re okay with that ?
well , i don &apos;t have a choice .
i feel like we always have a choice .
the mailbox you were trying to reach is full .
you &apos;re early .
you &apos;re beautiful .
okay , i want to see pictures ,
i want to hear details , i want to--
okay , i promise , i will relive the entire trip ,
but right now what i want is for you to come here .
thank you .
for what ?
for being here .
hanna , what &apos;s wrong ?
ask me what &apos;s right if you want a shorter answer .
i threw up on isabel &apos;s dress .
my dad has never been more mad at me ,
and after tonight ,
kate &apos;s gonna be my wicked stepsister for life .
and what &apos;s even worse
is i have to wear a dress that doesn &apos;t fit right .
i can &apos;t find the right bra ,
which means i &apos;m gonna have back fat .
you could be the skinniest person in the world and ... !
hanna , hanna .
it reminds me of old times to see you like that .
i saw your car in the lot ,
thought you might like to take a coffee break .
oh , uh ... are you working on your paper ?
i really can &apos;t believe it &apos;s getting published .
the first time &apos;s overwhelming ,
but i don &apos;t have to tell you that .
when i read your poems , i remember
how easy it was for me to fall in love with you .
jackie , uh ...
i &apos;m seeing someone .
of course you are .
you &apos;re a total catch .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t realize that earlier .
but i wonder how things would be if we were both single .
but i &apos;m not , so , uh ...
i know . i get it .
to moving on .
to ... to moving on .
i walked toby outside .
and when i came back inside , it was here .
here ? like , in the middle of your kitchen ,
or here on your porch and you brought it inside ?
i haven &apos;t touched it .
guys , i never told you this ,
but dr. sullivan really helped me .
yeah , that was the reason that we trusted her .
she helped us all .
you don &apos;t think her ear &apos;s in here , do you ?
it &apos;s a big box for an ear .
&quot; you have until seven p.m. to save her .
&quot; these are my demands . &quot;
dolls ? !
&apos;kay ...
guess this is yours .
wait .
make jackie go away .
is there a creepier word than &quot; creepy &quot; ?
wait , this is the paper jackie &apos;s getting published
on théodore ... géricault ?
he &apos;s this french painter ...
who painted .
yeah , in a word .
but a also gave you this french article on géricault ,
and ... it &apos;s identical to jackie &apos;s paper .
she plagiarized this .
stop the wedding .
keep toby safe .
oh , my god .
toby was driving his truck this morning
and his brakes went out .
that wasn &apos;t an accident . that was &quot; a. &quot;
i didn &apos;t get one .
you &apos;ve been &quot; a &apos;s &quot; target for weeks , em .
yeah . maybe &quot; a &apos;s &quot; bored with you .
and i mean that as a good thing .
if &quot; a &quot; wants to shut me up , she found a way to do it .
i mean , we finally tell someone the truth ,
and now dr. sullivan &apos;s gone .
&quot; a &quot; can do that to anyone that we care about .
so we do these things , and &quot; a &quot; gives her back ?
is that what we &apos;re supposed to believe ?
i get that this is a game ,
but i don &apos;t understand it .
spence .
no , it &apos;s brilliant , actually .
&quot; a &quot; is being our ultimate &quot; frienemy , &quot;
forcing us to get what we want ,
but knowing that when we do ...
all hell breaks loose .
believe me , i really want to get rid of jackie ,
but if i use this to do it ,
ezra may never forgive me .
there &apos;s a reason we can &apos;t just go around telling the truth :
&apos;cause it comes back to bite you , hard .
okay . we &apos;ve got five hours
to obey our chucky dolls or ...
i saw &quot; a &quot; push ian off that bell tower ,
and there was no hesitation .
spence , what are you saying ?
she &apos;s saying that it felt
like it was easy for &quot; a &quot; to kill someone .
and i only know one way to keep toby safe ,
and that &apos;s to keep him away from me .
um
i didn &apos;t make a call before . i &apos;d like to make it now .
i got the examiner &apos;s report ,
and it &apos;s also missing page 5,
so i checked our case files in the computer system .
sir , there &apos;s no record of page 5 anywhere .
what was on that page ?
it was the analysis of the trace evidence
found on the victim &apos;s body .
you &apos;re telling me that every record of physical evidence
found on the deceased is gone ? !
i made a terrible mistake , and i need you !
looking for mr. fitz ?
wrong floor .
who else knows about this ? does ezra ?
no .
what do you want ?
i think you need to leave hollis .
or ?
i &apos;m sorry i had to do this .
do you have a plan yet ?
em , my dad was m.i.a. for two years ,
and i thought i &apos;d never forgive him for that ,
but i have .
if i screw up this wedding , he &apos;s gonna leave again .
have you talked to him since last night ?
he talked to my mom .
isabel had to buy a new dress .
i &apos;ll , um , meet you at the church , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry about last night .
i know .
and i &apos;m sorry i put that much pressure on you
to make the toast .
this is gonna be an adjustment for everyone ,
but ... i think we can all find a way to get along .
one big happy family .
it can be ,
if you accept it .
dad , are you really sure you want to do this ?
look , i know that you and mom aren &apos;t perfect together ,
but ... i don &apos;t know , you were having so much fun here .
your mom &apos;s a lot smarter than i am ,
and she helped me realize
i was avoiding making this commitment ,
but it &apos;s not because i don &apos;t love isabel .
it &apos;s just , sometimes
when things are going really good for me ,
i screw &apos; em up before someone else can .
i know . it doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense ,
but it &apos;s a habit i &apos;m trying to break .
so you really do love isabel ?
she makes me happy , kiddo .
spencer .
you &apos;re scaring me .
you said it was important , but you &apos;re not talking .
it &apos;s because ...
i know when you hear what i have to say ...
you &apos;ll realize that i &apos;m not the person you think i am .
no , that &apos;s not true .
i lied to you this morning .
my dad told me a whole lot more
than just to mind my own business .
i @-@ i feel like we &apos;ve been in this together with your family ,
and with jason too .
yeah .
so what i don &apos;t understand is why you lied .
there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s so much that you don &apos;t know .
and i can never tell you .
don &apos;t you trust me ?
i thought we felt the same way about each other .
look , i found a way to survive my secrets ,
but everybody that i care about gets hurt .
and you deserve to be with somebody who can be honest with you .
so , i &apos;m sorry .
spencer .
spencer .
wait !
you look beautiful .
thanks .
so , how did it go ?
mike seems relieved ,
and his therapist said he was really open to talking .
good .
i &apos;m sorry i asked you to lie .
you know i do try to do everything right ,
and sometimes i just get it wrong .
trust me , i understand .
mike was starving ,
so dad took him to papa &apos;s pizza .
that sounds like mike .
so i &apos;m going to go take a long , hot bath ,
and pretend for one hour that i &apos;m the perfect parent .
mom .
we all get it wrong sometimes .
oh , i got it .
what are you doing here ?
finishing what you started .
my mom &apos;s right upstairs .
scary , isn &apos;t it , playing with fire .
you need to leave .
i made a huge mistake when i let him go .
well , you &apos;re making an even bigger mistake being here right now .
that &apos;s not how i see it .
you and i are similar , aria .
i guess that means ezra has a type .
no , i really don &apos;t see any resemblance .
actually , you &apos;re a lot like me .
we &apos;re both willing to do whatever it takes to keep him .
you don &apos;t have him to keep .
that &apos;s about to change .
i &apos;m not leaving hollis ,
but you are leaving ezra ,
and if you mention this conversation
or my research material to anyone ...
i suppose ezra &apos;s young enough
to start over again somewhere else ,
but the fallout of a student / teacher affair
has got to be a bitch .
you know that that would hurt him way more than me .
i don &apos;t want to hurt him ...
but i will if i have to .
cute dress .
prepare to make a right turn .
that &apos;s weird .
make an immediate right turn .
i &apos;m taking you to her . go alone .
right turn , please .
on the record , yes , it was an anonymity
that led authorities to the suspects ,
but that &apos;s all i can give you right now .
okay , okay , come , let &apos;s go .
officer , can you tell us what they were trying to hide ?
officer , was it a body ?
hey , i said move .
i should probably get going .
i was just thinking of the evening
you caught me sneaking a smoke .
yeah .
you looked stunning ...
and this is history repeating itself .
thank you .
not for the compliment , but for the ride home .
and listening to me ,
i really don &apos;t ever let myself cry in front of anybody ,
but you made it really easy .
yeah , i often have that effect on women .
i &apos;ve never actually known a guy who carried a hanky ,
so ... so i don &apos;t ...
really know what the protocol is .
i don &apos;t know if you want me to wash it first or just ...
maybe you talked yourself out of the carpenter too soon .
none of us are perfect , spencer .
we all come with baggage .
yeah , well , the carpenter has a name .
and he would need a forklift
to maneuver through my tonnage of emotional debris .
you know , i &apos;m actually certified to operate one of those .
no , i can &apos;t imagine you operating
any sort of heavy machinery .
yeah , me neither . i made that up .
but i did get you to smile .
i really need to go .
whoa . here .
thanks .
i know this is incredibly inappropriate for me to say ,
but i &apos;m desperate to kiss you .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;ve been dying to do that .
you have terrible timing .
amongst other things .
hanna said that emily left before she did .
em , where are you ?
i &apos;m worried , spence .
you &apos;re not alone .
they really do look happy .
try to contain your enthusiasm .
why so glum , hanna ?
feeling a little hung ?
i think your purse is ringing .
that &apos;s a very handsome suit .
and that is a very pretty dress .
but you should know it gives you back fat .
she &apos;s about to run out of air .
a
you have arrived at your destination .
love one another , but not make a bond of love .
let it be as a moving sea
between the shores of your souls .
fill each other &apos;s cup , but drink not from one cup .
give one another of your bread ...
... but eat not from the same loaf .
sing and dance together and be joyous ,
but let each one of you be alone ,
even as the ...
isabel ?
can i talk to you for a moment ?
uh , hanna , whatever it is , it can wait .
um , no , it can &apos;t , dad .
let &apos;s go into the rectory .
what &apos;s this about ?
i think hanna &apos;s about to need a getaway car .
yeah . let &apos;s go .
when my dad came back to rosewood ,
he hooked up with my mom , and , um ...
and &quot; hooked up &quot; means that they slept together .
i know what it means .
is this ... true ?
i &apos;m sorry .
457 grover rd .
a
dr. sullivan ?
no , no , no !
hello !
let me out !
somebody let me out !
somebody help me ! let me out !
you need to go home , boy . you have no reason to be here .
i &apos;m not your boy and i am not about leaving ,
you are in no position to argue .
spencer !
i don &apos;t care what you can &apos;t tell me .
i care about you ! i love you !
do you hear me ? i love you !
spencer !
spencer !
3 hours earlier .
it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re with me now .
alison ?
it &apos;s so good to see you , emily .
i think i miss you the most .
just rest .
it &apos;s what you need . rest .
i never told you this , but ...
you were always my favorite .
nobody loved me as much as you did .
is this what dying is ?
that bitch thinks this is what you really want--
to be completely free of &quot; a. &quot;
do you know who &quot; a &quot; is ?
of course i do .
you have to tell me .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
why ?
because two can only keep a secret
if one of them is dead .
you have to decide what you want , emily .
you can stay here ...
or you can come with me .
sweet emily .
emily !
emily !
em , are you okay ?
what happened ?
she &apos;s still alive .
she was here .
did you see dr. sullivan ?
i saw alison .
em . are you okay ?
i haven &apos;t said a word to anyone .
they &apos;re ... watching us .
what did the doctor say ?
he gave me some oxygen . i &apos;m fine .
i want to see my daughter ,
and i want to see her now .
i understand , but i have to wait for the officer in charge .
well , they &apos;re in custody , but they haven &apos;t been booked .
well , yeah , i understand , but ...
i have to call you back .
what the hell are you doing here ?
don &apos;t .
you need to stay away from this .
i think my sister would want me here .
look ...
this isn &apos;t just about me , all right ?
it &apos;s about you .
i did things to protect you that you don &apos;t even know about .
my mother told me about the will , okay ?
and you didn &apos;t need to do that .
i didn &apos;t kill ali .
i never thought you did .
jason , i have watched you grow up .
i &apos;ve seen what you &apos;ve gone through ,
and i was honest with you last night
because i thought it would help .
no , you told me because i didn &apos;t give you a choice .
why do you think i bought that house , huh ?
i knew what i &apos;d find .
ali was great at keeping secrets ,
but she was also great at punishing people with the truth .
does she know ?
no .
and she &apos;s not gonna find out tonight .
you shouldn &apos;t be here !
you blacked out .
maybe you just don &apos;t remember getting the doors open .
that wasn &apos;t there before .
it &apos;s a set of latitude / longitude coordinates .
北纬40 ° 24 &apos; 西经75 ° 17 &apos; 8 &quot;
the text &quot; a &quot; sent me in the church
said she was about to run out of air .
did &quot; a &quot; bury dr. sullivan alive ?
okay , i think we have to go left up here ,
and then it &apos;s not much farther .
&quot; not much farther &quot; in these heels
is like a marathon in flats .
can &apos;t do it .
here .
wait . it says that this is it . we &apos;re here .
uh ... there &apos;s nothing here .
guys .
could she be under there ?
she &apos;s still alive , but we should start digging !
dr. sullivan !
there &apos;s something down there !
oh , my god ! her boots ! those are her boots !
go ! fast !
come on !
dr. sullivan !
what the hell-- ?
they are all here .
this is the police . stay where you are !
&quot; a &quot; set us up !
yeah , but for what ?
there &apos;s nowhere to run !
well , veronica &apos;s in with them now .
she &apos;ll see that they &apos;re protected ,
but they &apos;re gonna need a criminal attorney .
what &apos;s ezra doing here ?
uh ... why don &apos;t you hear peter out ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
ella .
i know why you &apos;re here .
you need to understand that i ...
stop .
this is a very small town .
people see things , and they talk .
i actually thought you were an outstanding teacher .
i &apos;m in love with her .
i &apos;m gonna give you one chance to walk away from this .
not because you deserve it ,
but because this is the
last thing we need to deal with right now .
and when you go , you need to keep going ,
because if spencer &apos;s parents find out about this ,
they will ruin you .
i thought detective wilden was fired .
he was suspended for his actions ,
but he &apos;s been reinstated
as the chief officer in this investigation .
how could that happen ?
he has evidence to back up his allegations .
and it &apos;s significant ,
or you wouldn &apos;t be here .
has anyone called my parents ?
they &apos;re on their way .
we couldn &apos;t have come up with a better plan .
i wish i could see those bitches right now .
i &apos;m sorry that they don &apos;t know that we &apos;re doing this to them .
are you ready to give up your career in law enforcement ?
i can &apos;t wait to get rid of this ridiculous uniform .
it &apos;s not smart for me to walk out of here tonight .
well , you &apos;re much more patient than i am .
i &apos;ve been waiting months to get into that storage room .
i think i can wait a little longer to quit the force .
are you still worried about jason ?
you know , he &apos;s figured out that he &apos;s not the one that killed her ,
but he &apos;s got no idea that we wrote that note .
and we &apos;re getting away with it .
when alison dilaurentis was muedered ,
she was hit so hard , it made an indentation to her skull .
i &apos;ve given you guys so many chances
to just be honest with me .
evidence doesn &apos;t lie .
we &apos;ve known all along what the murder weapon was .
tonight we caught you with it .
take this home .
and burn it .
is it page 5 ?
it &apos;s over , jenna .
there &apos;s nothing left
to link us to that night .
she deserved to die like that .
i &apos;ve done everything you &apos;ve asked me to do .
how are you doin &apos; tonight , pretty eyes ?
