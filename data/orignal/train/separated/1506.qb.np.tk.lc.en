yes , i am still sick .
yes , i &apos;m going to work on a saturday .
no , this is not wine . it is dayquil .
with a little bit of last night &apos;s wine .
my stupid brother caught a cold
in mexico on his honeymoon ,
and it &apos;s made its way through the family .
i never get sick .
i @-@ i must &apos;ve caught a chill on the beach
when my socks got wet .
my ankles burn .
it went to my ears on our flight home .
i may have moaned a bit .
a crying baby complained about me .
cam brought me this from mexico ,
along with two weeks of bronchitis .
i don &apos;t know which is worse .
it gave me the vertigo .
i was too dizzy for high heels .
i had to wear flats .
i don &apos;t know how people can walk in those things .
i missed the first two days of culinary camp ,
so i was hopelessly behind on all reductions and meringues .
you can imagine the nicknames .
i thought &quot; amuse @-@ douche &quot; was particularly cruel .
i threw up for three straight days .
i don &apos;t know how models do it .
knock &apos; em dead at the big meeting today , honey .
kiss for good luck ?
oh , no ! i &apos;m not getting you sick .
this cold stops with me .
why do you think i swapped beds with luke last night ?
you did ?
appreciate the back rub .
not sure i love being called &quot; miss thang . &quot;
no !
hey , everybody .
hey , dad --
noooo .
mitch and cam were stuck for a wedding videographer ,
so i hooked them up with a friend who shoots infomercials .
he kind of owed me .
i can see why you call them &quot; miracle gloves . &quot;
my headache &apos;s completely gone .
he dropped off the video
for the big viewing party
at jay and gloria &apos;s tonight , and i decided to preview it .
what &apos;s wrong ?
watch .
i &apos;m gonna keep it short
&apos;cause i got a tee @-@ time in 10 minutes .
oh , god .
kind of funny .
my dad died 25 years ago today .
ew ! right on the cake .
i know . keep watching .
... nice to replace that sad memory
with this happy one .
don &apos;t tell me uncle mitch drinks it .
of course he does -- every drop .
may your first marriage be as goods my second .
to the grooms .
wait a minute . i take that back .
to my sons .
why didn &apos;t you just cover your mouth ?
oh , i finally did .
you know what this means ?
i &apos;m patient zero .
what i thought were allergies
started the cold that brought the whole family down !
no one can ever know about this --
not after what happened in yosemite .
the pink @-@ eye apocalypse .
a mountain chickadee !
where ?
take a look and send it down the line .
where ? where do you see it ? i want to see .
oh , right there ! right there ! right there !
it took me a whole year to earn back
the respect and admiration of my family .
well ...
but it &apos;s six hours to the screening ,
and i have to edit out all those sneezes
without ruining jay &apos;s speech .
that means special effects ,
that means overlapping green screen .
what am i saying ? ! it &apos;s impossible !
i &apos;m sorry , dad .
no , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s time to stop whining like a little girl
and man up !
let &apos;s put on our unitards !
and manny -- he &apos;s been missing a lot of kicks lately .
he could cost us a game .
i may have to bench him .
a coach has to do what &apos;s best for the team .
does family loyalty mean nothing to you , mitchell ?
not to mention i &apos;d be facing the wrath of jay and gloria .
well , then you should play him .
and risk our perfect 3 @-@ 0 record
in my first year as the varsity football coach ,
when this could be a stepping @-@ stone
to a college job or who knows what else ?
you know , it &apos;s basically a cinderella story .
well , at least you have the outfit for it .
are you gonna help me or not ?
i &apos;m sorry . um ... okay .
well , maybe what you could do is --
you know what i could do ... is coach .
you know , manny &apos;s just in a slump .
you know , he &apos;s lacking confidence .
it &apos;s not gonna be easy , but i could pull this off .
that &apos;s what you said about the cinderella costume ,
and two hours later , we were calling the auto club .
we &apos;re going in the backyard .
to identify insects .
oh , i love that .
i did that .
sydney barrow -- like my lily , a gifted child ,
and , thanks to a little matchmaking , her new friend .
yeah , i @-@ it can be challenging
finding playmates for an exceptional child .
i don &apos;t mean to brag ,
but that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t have any friends .
yeah , alan , i &apos;m sending claire to meet with you .
i got my kid &apos;s game .
yeah , he &apos;s the kicker .
could all come down to him .
yeah , take it easy .
don &apos;t talk like that .
look . you &apos;re stressing him out .
you &apos;re stressed out ?
a little .
good ! &apos; cause stress is all part of football .
if you &apos;re not throwing up in your mouth ,
you &apos;re not doing it right .
ay . don &apos;t pay attention to jay , papi .
you &apos;re gonna be great .
you &apos;re my perfect little angel boy .
there &apos;s still a few hours left before game time .
i think i &apos;ll just go lie down under my bed for a little while .
you see what you do to him ?
he &apos;s fine . nerves are good .
just before a playoff game one time ,
i pulled out a whole eyebrow .
hey , claire . what &apos;s up ?
my fever , you orange jackass .
oh . okay .
so , obviously , you have my cold now .
everybody &apos;s first symptom seems to be hate .
just pound the liquids , two days in bed .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
i don &apos;t have two days .
as a matter of fact ,
i have to go to a client meeting right now .
why ?
because i have a job and people are counting on me .
oh . no . someone &apos;s counting on you .
this is about you and dad and how you just
love being his toughy @-@ tough little supergirl
who never stays home sick ,
won a tennis tournament
with a broken finger
that she couldn &apos;t even hold up .
i &apos;m holding it up now .
daddy &apos;s approval is not the medicine that you need .
why don &apos;t you just call him and tell him
that you can &apos;t take the meeting ,
old toughy @-@ tough @-@ super @-@ tough ?
why are you trying to turn this into a fight ?
i called to yell at you for getting me sick .
love you . bye .
i love you , too .
chicken , dog .
oh , so close .
my turn .
chicken , chicken .
dog , dog .
ibex , ibex !
oh , look at you go !
for far too long ,
lily &apos;s friends just haven &apos;t challenged her .
it &apos;s been this endless procession of paste @-@ eating ,
toilet @-@ missing shoe @-@ losers .
but these two together --
they raise each other &apos;s game .
* how i wonder what you are *
so good , lily .
i can play , but i don &apos;t really sing .
that &apos;s okay . everybody can &apos;t be good at every--
daddy , where &apos;s my shoe ?
okay , manny , take a deep breath .
picture it going through the uprights .
keep it simple -- eyes on the ball , shoulders up ,
see your foot hit it , drive through the ball .
finish at your target !
even simpler this time --
kick the ball with your foot .
great contact on that last one .
this time , aim for the ball .
okay , this time , like you mean it .
i &apos;m really sorry .
okay , manny , look ...
there &apos;s no easy way to tell you this .
hola , manny !
but , um ... i , uh , really like the way
you &apos;re keeping your uniform clean .
color @-@ safe bleach , coach .
you &apos;ll be fine during the game .
kick it like you kicked sugary drinks last summer .
okay .
so , i saw the practice .
not very good .
i &apos;m so glad you saw that , because --
he &apos;s getting all the bad kicks
out of the way before the game !
he &apos;s so good ! bravo , manny !
go get &apos; em , coach .
you too .
oh , no .
i &apos;d already had cam &apos;s clogged ears ,
my dad &apos;s bronchitis ,
and then there it was , right on schedule --
gloria &apos;s vertigo .
even i have my limits .
call dad .
paul rudd is an american film and television actor .
shut up .
call ... dad !
hey , honey . how you doing ?
i &apos;m at the hotel ,
and i &apos;m really fighting this cold .
well , then , that cold doesn &apos;t stand a chance , huh ?
nothing stops my little supergirl .
yeah .
what &apos;s up ?
nothing . i just ...
i wanted you to know that i &apos;m on this , dad .
i never doubted that , honey .
yeah .
where &apos;s the lounge ?
at the far end .
perfect .
i remember your junior year ,
you played so tough through that tournament .
what was that ? uh .. .field hockey .
rugby .
right , and , uh ,
well , you sprained your ankle .
could have been a hairline fracture .
that &apos;s even better .
but it didn &apos;t stop you . you rolled right through it .
yeah .
i was a pretty proud papa that day .
okay , stop !
all right . i &apos;m embarrassing her .
i &apos;ll see you tonight , honey .
bye .
alan .
hey , claire .
hey .
it &apos;s been ages .
yeah .
i hope you &apos;re hungry .
i got us a table
at the revolving rooftop restaurant .
oh , no .
claire ?
here i am right before the cake sneeze .
it looks like i &apos;m cracking up , right ?
so from here , we &apos;ll jump to a green @-@ screen
shot of you laughing , too .
then i &apos;ll take that and drop it into
a pre @-@ existing shot of a table full of people .
easy !
and we are laughing .
bigger .
like when i do yoda walking into a spider web .
nailed it !
if laughter &apos;s the best medicine ,
then you &apos;re grape @-@ flavored triaminic .
okay , now i need some footage of me reacting to jay &apos;s speech
to replace the champagne sneeze ,
and i &apos;ll just drop that into another table full of people .
how would i react to jay &apos;s speech ?
give me &quot; touched . &quot;
now sad .
sadder .
come on . dig deep .
think about me going off to college .
why are you smiling ?
uh , i @-@ i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d get in .
i don &apos;t want to waste a saturday night
watching some video .
let &apos;s just stay home and rent a movie .
okay , two things -- a movie is a video ,
and the only reason you don &apos;t want to go to grandpa &apos;s
is because you &apos;re avoiding andy .
avoid ? i don &apos;t --
i --
i &apos;m not having this conversation .
oh , please . you &apos;ve been dodging him since the wedding .
you told me to stay away from him .
i just meant don &apos;t lead him on
unless you really like him .
yes , and you were right ,
so i &apos;ve been keeping my distance to protect him .
well , that &apos;s actually really mature of you .
with great hotness comes great responsibility .
there she is .
8 : 10
if manny makes this one , we go ahead .
lot of pressure .
i &apos;ll bet he &apos;s chewing on his own stomach acid right now .
sorry to be so sentimental . i just miss it .
manny , kick this one hard !
that &apos;s my boy !
actually , that &apos;s our boy .
oh , that &apos;s our boy .
moment of truth .
if you see even the tiniest problem , point it out .
my dad died 25 years ago today .
that did not land quite the way i &apos;d hoped .
cam , mitchell ...
may your first marriage be as happy as my second .
to the grooms .
wait a minute . i take that back .
oh , that &apos;s so bad .
to my sons .
oh . jay .
o ... kay . i have a few notes .
what am i gonna do ?
we have to show this thing in an hour !
you know what you &apos;d tell me ?
show the real video and take your lumps .
i don &apos;t wanna .
that &apos;s what i would say .
and then you would tell me ,
&quot; you might not want to do it ,
&quot; but you have to do what &apos;s right .
&quot; and that will make you
go from patient zero to patient hero . &quot;
damn it , i &apos;ve got a point .
how does someone so smart sneeze on so many things ?
finished !
let &apos;s see .
oh . i &apos;m sorry , but did someone rob an art gallery ?
because this is absolutely beau--
done !
okay .
we should probably put your names on those
so we can remember whose is whose .
next activity .
okay , lily knows all the capitals .
dad !
it &apos;s all right , honey .
the first is albany .
then there &apos;s ... ?
ohh ! i thought you meant world capitals .
algeria , algiers .
angola --
oh . well , you &apos;re just a little know @-@ it @-@ all , aren &apos;t ya ?
oh , my god . i am so sorry . i -- oh .
okay . sydney , forget that i said that , okay , honey ?
i can &apos;t ! i have a photographic memory !
you made my friend cry !
no , i didn &apos;t mean to --
oh , boy .
you did that on purpose !
no , no . i @-@ i don &apos;t think i did .
oh , gosh . and there &apos;s your mother .
sydney , sweetheart , we got to stop crying , okay ?
you &apos;re okay .
oh . now my watch is caught .
all right , little pull . little pull !
it &apos;s fine ! it &apos;s fine !
oh , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
we had so much fun .
oh , good .
sydney , honey , are you crying ?
he ruined my picture and pulled my hair !
just little accidents .
and he called me a know @-@ it @-@ all !
what kind of a person calls a 6 @-@ year @-@ old a know @-@ it @-@ all ?
she &apos;s a year younger than you ?
should i not have come ?
oh , is it gonna be weird for andy ?
i shouldn &apos;t have dressed so cute .
hey , switch sweaters with me .
just be yourself .
it &apos;s the surest way for him to get over you .
okay , thanks .
hey , uncle cam .
hey .
oh , my gosh . i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
you got to talk to lily .
she &apos;s not speaking to me because --
i have bigger problems .
i haven &apos;t even told you what mine is yet .
i benched manny .
i &apos;m worried jay and gloria are mad at me .
have they said anything ?
no .
all i &apos;ve gotten from them so far is &quot; hola &quot;
and &quot; that scotch is not for company . &quot;
oh , my gosh , phil , is that the wedding video ?
oh , we are so excited to see it .
i &apos;m so excited to show you guys !
get in the media closet . cut every wire .
dad , get ahold of yourself .
you &apos;re right .
i said , &quot; you &apos;re right &quot; !
sorry . i already had it loaded up .
everybody come to dinner .
then we watch the wedding movie .
hey , thank you guys so much for hosting .
and i hope there &apos;s no hard feelings about manny .
you &apos;re the coach . you can &apos;t play favorites .
exactly .
i am so relieved to hear you say that .
no , no , no . one of our chairs is broken .
come . i have a special seat for you .
mitchell !
she benched me .
no ! you beat me again !
well , this is embarrassing for you .
oh . hey , stranger .
i let him win .
how you been ?
oh , good , good . just busy .
i figured i &apos;d say hi . it &apos;s been a while .
i know , right ?
i &apos;ve been busy , too , between this little guy
and visiting my family back home .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m really glad you came by .
i was afraid things got , like ... weird
last time we saw each other .
y @-@ yeah , about that -- um , i rea--
oh ! i knew it .
i am such a goober sometimes .
i was just confused about beth ,
and i thought you were sending me some signals ,
which is so stupid .
i hope i didn &apos;t , like , creep you out or something .
you shouldn &apos;t feel stupid .
you know , you were vulnerable , i was at a wedding ,
everybody was super @-@ gay ,
and nobody was looking at me .
i probably did send you a signal .
i &apos;m sorry if i gave you the wrong idea .
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m just glad we didn &apos;t take it any further .
because clearly , we are wrong for each other .
totally . we are way better as friends .
way !
like , imagine if we kissed or something .
ha ! that would &apos;ve been a disaster .
a huge disaster .
you would &apos;ve been destroyed .
yeah -- what ?
whoa , joe . what &apos;s with the snow on the roof ?
you &apos;re aging like a president .
claire texted to start .
she &apos;s going to be a little late .
well , that &apos;s crazy .
we should wait for her
and watch the wedding video some other time .
no , no , no . let &apos;s eat .
i &apos;m not very hungry .
i still have the taste of failure in my mouth .
sit down . this is a family dinner .
we all eat together .
are there potatoes ? i smell potatoes .
here you go , sweetheart .
you eat it .
lily , it wasn &apos;t that bad .
you still got my friend &apos;s hair in your watch !
she &apos;s coming back .
what were you thinking with that playdate ?
i was feeling protective .
that girl made lily feel bad .
or did she make you feel bad ?
i didn &apos;t love it .
that happens with all first @-@ time parents .
we think our kids are the best or the smartest .
for the longest time , that &apos;s how we felt about haley .
&quot; the longest time &quot; ? really ?
you can &apos;t force your kids
to live up to your unreal expectations .
they &apos;re not perfect , but you love them anyway .
also applies to adults -- probably more so .
that is what i &apos;m doing , isn &apos;t it ?
jay does it all the time with manny &apos;s football .
look at him -- he &apos;s so upset of disappointing him
that he won &apos;t eat today .
let &apos;s keep in mind what &apos;s important here --
we &apos;re mad at cam .
you have always been like this .
you put so much pressure into your kids
that they fall into pieces .
i never put more pressure on my kids than they can handle .
oh , don &apos;t be mad , dad .
i &apos;m sorry . i tried . i really -- i tried .
knock , knock . me again .
hey , you .
hey . so , uh , quick follow @-@ up .
um , when you said i would be destroyed if we had kissed ,
what exactly did you mean by that ?
oh , gosh .
i guess that is confusing , huh ?
yeah .
i just meant that you would &apos;ve been emotionally ruined .
what ? !
yeah . i don &apos;t understand it myself ,
but there &apos;s a lot of heat coming off of this .
girls do not get over this guy .
i &apos;m not calling myself a drug , but --
i &apos;m sorry . hasn &apos;t beth broken up with you , like , 10 times ?
she &apos;s dying to get back with me , though .
i wouldn &apos;t say it &apos;s withdrawal , but --
for the record , guys don &apos;t get over me , okay ?
at last count , i have three stalkers .
one of them has my face spray @-@ painted on his van .
i had to stand there forever while he did it !
okay .
i didn &apos;t mean to imply that if we kissed ,
it wouldn &apos;t affect me .
are you kidding ?
you are so pretty and so out of my league .
it would &apos;ve ... rocked my world .
okay , then .
it just would &apos;ve hit you harder . that &apos;s all .
mr. pritchett ! your bath awaits !
are you prepared for a bum @-@ scrubbing today , sir ?
ohhh , no .
i said something wrong , didn &apos;t i ?
no .
no , i &apos;m just being stupid .
the point is is that , you know , we &apos;re good , right ?
you betcha .
aw , come on . don &apos;t be so formal .
come here , you .
i promised this little dude a bubble beard .
come here .
don &apos;t be a stranger , okay ?
honey , be a little selfish here .
you are not up for watching this video .
why were you even out of the house like this ?
because i &apos;m your toughy @-@ tough supergirl .
yes , you are , but that &apos;s no reason to risk you--
away from the food !
can we catch this again ?
this is exactly what you do !
to his own daughter .
kind of puts me benching manny in perspective .
also , is there a sauce going around or ...
cam , you were right to bench me .
i stunk out there .
vindicated !
but not because of jay .
it &apos;s you , mom .
what ? !
tensions are running high .
i think we should all go home .
i &apos;ve never worried about disappointing jay .
he knows i &apos;m terrible at sports .
said it from day 1 .
only thing coordinated about this kid was his outfits .
the way you call me your perfect little angel boy and stuff ,
i just feel like i &apos;m letting you down .
ay , manny , i &apos;m so sorry .
you could never let me down ,
because you &apos;re my per--
you &apos;re okay .
i cued up the wedding video .
all by yourself ?
let &apos;s watch it . what do you say ?
okay .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m nervous .
is this- is this a good time ?
yes .
it feels like -- o @-@ okay .
let &apos;s go now . come on .
f @-@ full disclosure --
everybody may not look their best in this video .
it &apos;s good .
it &apos;s about time we all start seeing ourselves as who we really are ,
not who we &apos;re trying to be
or who other people want us to be .
right .
see , now , that is a very complicated machine .
she is a genius .
not a good start .
hit it , lily .
this is gonna be good for you .
i don &apos;t like you right now .
结婚庆典
oh , god .
is that -is that my dancing ?
is that what i look like ?
no , no . okay , that &apos;s really funny .
fast forward . come on .
that &apos;s actually really sweet , cam .
is that my crying face ?
oh , it &apos;s hideous ! why hasn &apos;t anyone told me ? !
oh , god , i &apos;m doing it right now , aren &apos;t i ?
give me that .
congratulations , mitch and cam !
look at me in that dress !
i look gorgeous !
give me rewind !
mom , look at you holding on to that bar .
you had vertigo there , too .
yeah , i sure did .
you know , we don &apos;t have to linger on that .
oh , mom !
hey , everybody . i want to say something .
all that sweat . what the hell ? !
i look like i had shamu in a headlock !
i think i &apos;m gonna throw up .
yeah , you and me both . i &apos;m disgusting !
no , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s haley &apos;s nausea . oh , god !
i &apos;m gonna keep it short .
yeah , you will .
120 people in that room ,
and no one told me to put my arm down !
i have an idea , actually .
why don &apos;t i re @-@ edit the video
and cut out the embarrassing parts ?
is that a problem ?
not at all !
that &apos;s great !
done !
thank you so much .
i know you sneezed on the cake .
no one likes a know @-@ it @-@ all !
mitchell .
come to bed .
aren &apos;t you ever gonna sleep ?
no . no , i don &apos;t think i &apos;am .
