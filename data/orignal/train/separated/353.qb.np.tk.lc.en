hey where &apos;s hotch ?
budget meeting .
maybe he &apos;ll get us a raise .
they &apos;re cutting not raising .
i just hope they don &apos;t take the coffee .
i &apos;d quit .
oh yeah . that &apos;ll save &apos; em like 50 bucks a week .
he &apos;ll meet us on the plane .
where are we going ?
last night 3 decapitated heads
were found in front of a sheriff &apos;s station
in the small border town of terlingua texas .
3 victims at once ?
actually they appear to be in different stages of decomposition .
m.e. confirmed that one of the heads is a day or so old .
the other 2 appear to have died a few months ago
but the wound edges
suggest that they were decapitated recently .
dirt in their mouth ears and nose .
at some point these two heads were buried .
and then dug up .
ok so why the sudden need to display them ?
the need may not be so sudden .
mexico in 2009 alone
10 heads in coolers
and the people belonging to these heads
were killed just hours before they were found .
result of a battle between feuding drug cartels .
dea &apos;s not interested ?
they asked us to take a look at it .
considering the different decomposition
this might not even be about drugs .
then what do we have ?
well the victims are two males one female
so no gender preference .
staging the heads in front of a sheriff &apos;s station--
that &apos;s aggressive .
all 3 victims are hispanic .
and unidentified .
terlingua has a large illegal population .
it &apos;s made i.d.ing the victims that much harder .
he might be trying to make some type of political statement .
volunteer border patrols do a lot of personal policing down there .
groups like the minutemen
prize law and order above everything else .
and those patrols serve their political agenda .
murder would be bad for their image .
staging the heads in front of a police station
suggests that the unsub might be local .
he &apos;d have to have a knowledge
about how to do something like that without being seen .
so what we have is hundreds of miles
of unincorporated desert
and an endless supply of anonymous victims
crossing the border every day .
it &apos;s a serial killer &apos;s perfect storm .
&quot; a lion &apos;s work hours are only when he &apos;s hungry .
&quot; once he &apos;s satisfied
the predator and prey live peacefully together . &quot;
chuck jones .
explain this to me .
the unsub hunts along the u.s.-mexico border .
how big is that area ?
over 5.000 square miles of desert .
he could have gone undetected for years .
so why announce himself ?
something happened recently .
what do we know about crime in terlingua ?
it &apos;s a stop @-@ over town .
immigrants stay only 24 hours before moving on
but that also makes them narco @-@ trafficking hubs .
outside of immigration violations
most of the arrests are drug related .
that my pretties is an understatement .
anyone familiar with the lugo cartel
out of baja california ?
their greatest hits-- the pun being inescapable--
include multiple brutal murders
along with importing and distributing
nearly 2 tons of cocaine
and copious amounts of heroin between 1990 and 2009 .
now if we get in our bau time machine
flash forward to now
a super cheap highly addictive
and totally impure form of black tar heroin
just showed up on the streets of terlingua
and the dea thinks the lugo cartel is directly responsible .
so they &apos;re expanding their operation .
which is often announced by a wave of violence .
the lugo cartel killed 2 dea agents last year .
we &apos;re going to need to watch our backs .
to cartels feds are fair game .
there &apos;s even usually a bounty so ...
we &apos;re going to bring in the toys .
be careful with those . i don &apos;t need broken mp @-@ 5mps
on our budget .
guys here &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t think i technically have authorization
to carry a weapon like that .
you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t .
you know we &apos;re going to have a victim pool
that is extremely hesitant to talk to us .
prentiss you and morgan start with the migrant community
see what inroads you can make .
stress that we &apos;re only there to catch a killer .
rossi and reid the m.e. is waiting
to show you the heads .
maybe they can tell us something .
what &apos;s this about ?
this is part of the lugo cartel .
excuse us .
federal agents . step aside .
we &apos;re legal citizens of this country
demonstrating our first amendment rights
to a peaceful assembly
in order to protest the unlawful arrest
of omar morales .
you walk around us .
agents sheriff ruiz is waiting inside .
ignore them .
don &apos;t do nothin &apos; stupid deputies .
anytime you want to make a move jose
you know where to find us .
all y &apos;all do .
sorry about the welcoming committee .
we didn &apos;t expect you for another half hour .
how many uh how many officers
in the whole department ?
including the sheriff 5 .
there are 8 men outside .
and that &apos;s the point right ? to show that they outnumber you .
well if it came down to numbers
we wouldn &apos;t stand a chance .
those scumbags are only a handful
of the soldiers who work for omar morales .
he &apos;s the head of a local narco traffic ring .
we picked him up this morning
just outside of town .
he was headed for the airport .
has he made a statement ?
not exactly .
meaning ?
sheriff ruiz won &apos;t let us talk to him .
and why is that ?
well maybe you can ask her why .
right this way .
fbi &apos;s here .
eva ruiz .
i &apos;m glad you could make it .
agent hotchner .
this is agent jareau .
can i get you anything ? coffee ?
no thank you .
ma &apos;am how do you plan on dealing
with the small army outside ?
i plan on ignoring them .
well we can have some of--
they &apos;ll get hot and tired and go away on their own .
they &apos;re the least of my worries .
we heard you made an arrest .
my deputies did .
but you don &apos;t agree ?
because they &apos;re wrong .
whoever staged these heads in front of your office
is trying to tell you something .
they want me to butt out .
of what exactly ?
i count more than 20 missing immigrants
just in the 6 months i &apos;ve been sheriff .
that &apos;s more than 3 in a month .
almost one victim a week .
these are just names and cursory descriptions .
is there any other paperwork ?
has there been any investigation ?
no one will make an official report
but i believe somebody around here
has been killing for a long time .
want a laugh ?
i left brooklyn north homicide
to slow down .
i picked the wrong part of the country
to semi @-@ retire .
this place is swimming in disfunction .
it &apos;s a game of survival and i can &apos;t trust anyone .
ma &apos;am you &apos;ve got 4 deputies .
who i expressly told to leave omar morales alone .
you can see how well they follow orders .
then you &apos;re sure this isn &apos;t the lugo cartel ?
murder to send a message
is the way these guys communicate .
come with me .
you know contrary to popular belief
decapitation is not that easy .
hmm . you don &apos;t often hear popular and decapitation
in the same sentence .
you need to strike on the weakest point of the spine .
it &apos;s normally between the c3 and c7 vertebrae .
there are multiple strikes
but they don &apos;t show any hesitation .
i realize you didn &apos;t have much to work with here
but outside of the obvious
was there anything unusual about these victims ?
well the second victim appeared to have been blind
if not completely then he had cataracts bad enough
that it was difficult for him to get around .
what about the other two ?
no .
the most recent victim is older .
so is the first one the woman .
well i only had their teeth to go by
so it would take some time to get an accurate age
but yeah i &apos;d agree . they were older .
we &apos;re looking for something that we call a signature .
something that all the victims shared
some physical mark something postmortem .
well i don &apos;t know if this is what you mean
but they all had sand residue in their noses and throats .
could that be from being buried ?
possibly . but the trachea and the nasal passage
they were kind of torn up .
if i had the lungs here
i &apos;d guess that they were full of sand as well .
you mean like they breathed in sand ?
forcefully enough that it lacerated the passages .
they were running .
this is agent hotchner from the fbi .
nice suit .
you know how much misery that guy is responsible for ?
yeah i &apos;ve heard some of the things this cartel &apos;s capable of .
your boss gonna talk to him ?
he &apos;s gonna try .
good luck .
what kind of message is this ?
it &apos;s funny ?
kind of yeah .
a competitor moves in on your business
is that what you would do ?
hypothetically ?
yeah .
i &apos;d gut him from crotch to chin
then leave his intestines open for the animals
after i sent his left hand to his wife
his eyes to his mother
and his tongue to his kids
with a note saying that their papa had died wetting himself .
a coward .
this this ain &apos;t no message .
hypothetically .
that &apos;s an interesting defense
saying that you would do worse .
a defense ? you asked me a question .
you think i need a defense charge me with something .
what do you know about the heads
that were left outside the sheriff &apos;s station last night ?
seriously ?
you &apos;re a man who likes to be in control .
you have a small army standing guard outside .
they protect you because
you &apos;ve convinced them somehow that they need you
and you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in your town ?
you didn &apos;t tell him ?
tell me what ?
you &apos;re looking for santa muerte .
the saint of death .
sheriff what exactly is omar talking about ?
every job has a patron saint .
cops have saint jude
doctors have raphael the archangel .
but if you &apos;re a drug dealer or a killer
who do you pray to ?
the saint of death .
i &apos;ve learned that crossing the desert to get here
you lose track of the ways you can die .
so if someone close doesn &apos;t make it
sometimes it &apos;s easier to blame a superstitious figure .
well omar doesn &apos;t seem like he believes what he &apos;s saying .
i didn &apos;t say he believes it .
i said it &apos;s who people are blaming .
what people ?
look santa muerte has been coming up more and more .
the illegals i send back . the coyotes i arrest .
some of the drug traffickers they &apos;re afraid .
afraid of a saint ?
i handled a homicide once
where my only witness was this 4 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
and she told me her mom and dad got killed by a dragon .
turns out the bad guy wore a green rain suit with a pointy hood .
to the kid it looked like a dragon .
so when hundreds of people are talking about the same monster
it &apos;s a sure bet something &apos;s going on .
they just don &apos;t know what to call it .
so they call it santa muerte .
i told you we should have kept that bastard locked up .
and i &apos;m telling you for the last time boyd
go back on patrol .
no decomposition . it &apos;s a new victim .
he &apos;s becoming more focused on you sheriff .
sheriff may i have a word with you ?
it &apos;s clear that this is personal .
it always was .
how &apos;s that ?
look i have no idea how many of these people
have gone missing over the years
but one thing is clear .
i &apos;m the only one who seems to give a damn .
that &apos;s as personal as it gets for me .
we &apos;re here because we care .
all i &apos;ve got is a bunch of stories and superstitions .
what if it isn &apos;t even happening ?
sheriff i can &apos;t tell you how long this has been going on
but something &apos;s definitely happening now .
and from the way the unsub is acting
it &apos;s obvious that you &apos;ve touched a nerve .
whoever he is i think you &apos;ve probably talked to him .
i &apos;ve talked to anyone who will listen .
drug dealers immigrants business owners--
well one of them is your santa muerte
and he &apos;s feeling the pressure .
when we get back to the station
i want to go over every single interview you &apos;ve done .
how ? who are we even looking for ?
we have a profile to give you and your deputies .
we &apos;re searching for a personality type called a human predator .
in the classic sense a hunter .
all the victims we &apos;ve been able to conclusively tie to him
have been older or handicapped in some way .
this suggests he waits for someone to separate from the pack
looks for the weakest .
like a lion or something .
except a lion hunts food .
this type of predator hunts power .
it &apos;s not about serving a need
and everything is a means to that end .
we also believe that he makes his victims run through the desert
in order to weaken them .
he may not be capable of taking them on in their strongest state
despite their age or infirmity .
this suggests that he &apos;s possibly handicapped in some way himself .
certainly weak maybe small or even thin .
and an unsub who creates chaos and then attacks
typically carries this through to all aspects of his life .
he &apos;s unlikely to be in a relationship .
if he is it &apos;s an abusive one .
this guy gets off on control .
he will have tried to stay very close to the investigation .
he &apos;s well aware that the sheriff
has started looking into the missing illegal immigrants .
how do you know that ?
it &apos;s probably why the decapitations started
as a countermeasure .
he &apos;s trying to throw off the investigation .
it &apos;s typical in an organized offender like this .
cary stayner the yosemite killer
drove more than 50 miles to dump cigarette packs
and driver &apos;s licenses at intersections to throw off suspicion .
start by looking back at everyone you &apos;ve talked to
in connection with these killings .
we need to start with people
who are familiar with the immigrant journey .
like who ? advocates ?
none of them will talk to us . i &apos;ve tried .
well the coyotes want this guy caught .
he &apos;s hurting their business .
and if the advocates really care about the immigrants
they &apos;re gonna want to find whoever is responsible as well .
there &apos;s one guy who could help .
he runs an outreach program called libertad .
where can we find him ?
clyde you want to take them over to meet richard corral ?
my lucky day .
these fbi agents want a word with you .
see the limp ?
hey baby girl i need you to run a check on someone for me .
what is wrong with you clyde ?
none of my clients will trust me
if i &apos;ve got federal agents walking around here .
well maybe you shouldn &apos;t spend your time
helping illegals sneak into the country .
they only want a better life .
well then they ought to come in the front door .
uh gentlemen another day ?
mr. corral
we understand your hesitation
but we aren &apos;t here about immigration we &apos;re here about murder .
do you know anything about the heads
that were left in front of the sheriff &apos;s station a few days ago ?
everyone does . my clients are terrified .
clients .
deputy ...
another man was murdered last night .
an immigrant .
we need to figure out how this man finds his victims .
sheriff ruiz said you know
more about these people &apos;s journey than anyone .
how many places are there to cross ?
for every tunnel we find
there &apos;s 12 more we don &apos;t know about .
and once they &apos;ve made it ?
runners keep documents in the trunks of their cars .
passports fake social security numbers green cards .
it &apos;s a big business .
especially in border towns .
do you know these runners ?
they change all the time .
if immigrants don &apos;t find you where do they go ?
safe houses .
it &apos;s supposed to be where they can find rest water food .
supposed to be ?
it &apos;s more like a prison
until their families can pay off the coyotes .
where are these safe houses ?
are you kidding ?
they come and go faster than the tunnels
ok . thank you for your time .
sheriff we could use a hand with the geographical profile .
we &apos;re trying to locate likely safe houses .
your team travels all around the country right ?
that &apos;s right .
my last year in homicide i handled 36 murders .
i was one of 20 detectives in my unit .
do the math .
don &apos;t ask me how many i solved .
i &apos;m sure you did the best you could .
there really isn &apos;t anywhere to go
where people aren &apos;t killing each other is there ?
likely safe houses ?
even if we could find a safe house
you really think someone who just crossed is gonna talk to us ?
well there &apos;s a good chance
that last night &apos;s victim didn &apos;t cross alone .
someone may be missing him .
if last night &apos;s illegals are still at safe houses
we can find the route they used
and we &apos;ll know the unsub &apos;s hunting grounds .
the whole point of a safe house is it &apos;s a secret .
if i &apos;d could find them i &apos;d shut them down .
all right if it &apos;s a first stop
we should start with homes that are closest to the border .
i could pull land deeds . might take a while .
we &apos;ve got something faster .
garcia .
sir .
we &apos;re looking for illegal immigrant safe houses in terlingua .
mm @-@ hmm . what are the parameters ?
start with homeowners and renters with criminal records .
uh @-@ huh . that &apos;s a start . give me more .
morgan said they &apos;re always moving .
look for homes with short @-@ term leases .
and spikes in utilities .
if they &apos;re housing illegals
there &apos;ll be a higher usage of power and water .
i &apos;m crossing with all texas utility companies .
and i have 3 . and i just sent the addresses to your phones .
thanks garcia .
if you &apos;re looking for a gift to get me
one of her would be greatly appreciated .
we &apos;re pretty sure they broke the mold .
you know we &apos;re not going to get very far
if you keep arguing about illegals with everyone .
this place used to be different .
how do you mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
different .
got it sir .
we &apos;re gonna split up possible safe houses .
the closest one to us is 10 minutes from here .
they ain &apos;t gonna be happy to see us .
you got a cell phone ?
yeah .
give me the number .
deputy we &apos;re at the back door . go ahead and knock .
police ! open up !
nice .
i played a little strong safety in college .
no idea what that means .
fbi . we got a few questions for you .
in here ?
you keep them in a stable ?
you got him ?
yeah .
go .
his mother .
prentiss .
gentry ! we need backup and medical units !
now you listen to me .
if you don &apos;t want to talk to me that &apos;s fine .
i don &apos;t care .
but you &apos;re facing rape kidnapping
weapons charges and numerous counts of federal conspiracy
to smuggle and harbor illegal aliens .
this is your last chance to help yourself my friend .
he doesn &apos;t look concerned .
it &apos;s because the whole border situation is chaos .
he has as much chance of just getting deported
as he does of doing prison time .
i &apos;ll make some calls see if i can pull some federal strings .
who &apos;s gonna pull the strings when you go home ?
her husband was sick and he stayed behind .
just like the others .
can he have soda ?
yeah . yeah of course .
come on big man let &apos;s get a soda .
i thought i sent you home an hour ago .
yeah uh something &apos;s bugging me .
that young boy says he remembers seeing the sun
when he crossed the border .
they crossed at night .
yeah i know . it got me thinking .
there &apos;s a big mural on the side of an old barn .
it &apos;s of the sun .
how far out ?
about 15 minutes .
want to take a ride ?
sure .
don &apos;t think i &apos;ve been out this way .
i used to ride out here when i was a kid .
horses ?
atvs .
never been on one of those .
yeah you gotta be careful with them .
you can wreck pretty good .
growing up all i ever had was a bicycle
if i could keep it long enough before it got stolen to ride it .
good reason to hate the city right ?
one of them .
there .
it looks a lot like the kid described .
santa muerte and the sun .
that &apos;s good police work boyd .
hey what do you think about that profile the fbi gave ?
what do i think ?
he may not be capable of taking them on in their strongest state
despite their age or infirmity .
they said the guy was a coward .
anyone kills that many people has gotta be a real bad @-@ ass .
well where i come from
preying on people who can &apos;t defend themselves
makes him a punk @-@ ass .
a coward .
putting a man &apos;s head outside your house
hardly seems like a coward .
something wrong with your leg boyd ?
yeah i busted it up pretty bad when i was a teenager .
can &apos;t hardly run anymore .
ooh it hurts like a bitch every time it &apos;s gonna rain now .
he &apos;s possibly handicapped in some way himself .
certainly weak . maybe small or even thin .
i didn &apos;t know you had a bad leg .
you didn &apos;t know anything about me .
excuse me ?
you just came from new york and took over
sticking your nose in things that were going just fine .
you &apos;re talking about the missings ?
the missing .
now how could someone be missing
if they ain &apos;t supposed to be here in the first damn place ?
they &apos;re gonna blame it all on omar .
i can get rid of that son of a bitch
and you .
why boyd ?
why ? huh .
why not ?
you won &apos;t make it .
i gotta try .
yeah i know .
where are all the deputies ?
maybe they found another head .
no the sheriff would have contacted us .
have you heard from her this morning ?
no sir i wasn &apos;t expecting to though .
jj come with me .
10 @-@ 4 unit 3 .
keep us posted on your progress .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s the sheriff . she &apos;s missing .
she never came in this morning .
her cruiser &apos;s missing too .
the whole department &apos;s looking for her .
did she say anything to you ? was she working on something ?
she was gone before we left here last night .
gone where ?
i thought she went home .
have garcia trace her cell phone .
see if she had any incoming calls last night .
this is boyd .
oh god .
i found her .
god she &apos;s all ...
just get me some help .
hurry .
deputy .
what he did ...
it &apos;s the sheriff ?
yeah . yeah it &apos;s her .
this isn &apos;t the same . this is angry .
and overkill .
it &apos;s a completely different m.o.
and a new victimology .
he goes from impossible to identify illegal immigrants
to a law enforcement officer ?
we &apos;re profiling a guy who picks on the weakest in a crowd .
i didn &apos;t know her that well
but weak doesn &apos;t seem to fit the sheriff .
it &apos;s also not random .
how so ?
it &apos;s what omar morales said he would do to a body to send a message .
he &apos;d tear someone up like that ?
that &apos;s exactly what he said he would do .
the evisceration hand the tongue .
he told ruiz and i when we first came into the interrogation room .
we &apos;re the evidence team .
right there .
is it her ?
what &apos;s left of her .
is there anything in the car ?
nothing that would indicate where she was headed last night .
there &apos;s no notebooks no log .
her body is mutilated in exactly the way
that omar morales the drug trafficker said he would mutilate a body .
we did profile the unsub would be someone close to the investigation .
but only ruiz and i heard him say it .
so omar looks good for this ?
except why would he kill the one person in town who didn &apos;t think he was the unsub ?
garcia says there &apos;s no activity
on the sheriff &apos;s cell past 9 p.m.
does anybody remember who was at the station last night when we arrived ?
the station ?
the sheriff &apos;s body was mutilated exactly the way the drug trafficker said he would do it .
oh no all of it ? the tongue too ?
you heard that ?
yeah i was at the window when you were talking to him .
there was a speaker on the wall .
was anybody else there ?
yeah deputy boyd .
deputy gannon where &apos;s deputy boyd ?
him and gentry went to pick him up .
pick up who ?
omar morales .
how do you want to play this ?
boyd !
don &apos;t do something stupid jose .
whoa whoa whoa . hey take it easy .
we can work this out .
boyd ! what the hell are you doing ?
this ain &apos;t gonna stick you know .
ronny what did you do ?
he had a gun .
what ?
he had a gun .
ronny he ain &apos;t got no gun .
i had to shoot him .
he killed two cops .
what ?
gentry .
gentry this is agent prentiss .
if he &apos;s near you please don &apos;t say anything .
we think the unsub may be deputy boyd .
gentry are you there ?
reid jj stay out here and stay alert .
it &apos;s gentry .
does this look legit to you ?
omar took shotgun hits .
gentry only has a pistol .
there &apos;s no powder residue on omar &apos;s hands either .
oh my god . what if he heard me ?
gannon where would boyd go ?
i don &apos;t know .
this is no time to be covering up .
he killed your boss and gentry .
i &apos;m not covering . i don &apos;t know the guy that well .
no one does . he &apos;s a loner .
my liege .
garcia deputy boyd is our unsub .
he has a police radio . can you track it ?
yeah . what &apos;s his unit number ?
call the sheriff &apos;s station .
get the serial numbers from the dispatcher .
ok i &apos;ll get back to you .
we profiled him as a hunter .
well now he &apos;s the hunted .
he &apos;ll go someplace he feels safe .
some place he knows he can control .
home ?
no i think a preplanned location .
sir i &apos;ve got him . he &apos;s heading northbound .
interstate ?
no he is not on a road at all .
he &apos;s driving through the desert .
keep tracking him garcia .
he &apos;s running .
not home for sure .
he lives in a trailer out west of town .
so where &apos;s he running to ?
morgan prentiss reid-- deputy
will you take them to his house see what you can find .
i need your radio .
what are you gonna do ?
keep him busy .
deputy boyd this is agent hotchner with the fbi .
i know you can hear me .
you have no place to go .
this is my desert . you think you can find me out here
yeah well come on out .
cocky little bastard .
the trouble is he &apos;s right .
we don &apos;t know anything about this desert .
hope they can find something .
oh god .
well we &apos;re definitely in the right place .
guys just breathe through your nose like normal .
smell is the weakest sense .
in a few more minutes you won &apos;t even notice it .
what about the taste ?
i think that &apos;s in your head .
all right spread out .
let &apos;s find out where this guy &apos;s headed here .
boyd this doesn &apos;t have to end any worse than it already is .
is that right ?
turn yourself in . i &apos;ll tell the judge you cooperated .
this is texas agent .
you think the judge gives a damn whether or not someone cooperated
when he &apos;s handing out the death penalty ?
now don &apos;t get me wrong . i wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
that &apos;s the only way to deal with someone like me .
think he &apos;s suicidal ?
or he &apos;s bluffing .
what &apos;s north of here ?
a whole lot of nothing .
he &apos;s not panicking .
there &apos;s something out there and he &apos;s headed for it .
oh god .
i found where the source of that smell is coming from .
oh my god .
well this is where he decapitated them .
guys come look at this .
i &apos;m ready for that smell weakness to kick in anytime reid .
listen . &quot; golden harvest grain and feed
suffered another setback today in a ruling over the death of foreman fred boyd . &quot;
&quot; boyd survived by his son ronald . &quot;
didn &apos;t the last victim &apos;s child say
that he saw the sun when he crossed ?
golden harvest that &apos;s out north of town .
sir i--i lost him . the signal &apos;s gone .
he smashed the radio .
garcia i need
a satellite photo of the last place that the signal showed .
there &apos;s something out there that &apos;s not on the map .
yes sir i &apos;m already working on that .
