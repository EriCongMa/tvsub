We had some girls come into our tent
and we ended up making out with them.
What is your goal here, Timothy?
To turn the student body against the administration?!
I've been fired.
This is our school.
If we don't like something about it,
we have to do something to change it.
My foster parents know I narced on them.
Think they're gonna welcome me back with open arms?
Where's your friend?
She ran away.
Flintwood has one of the best athletic programs in the country.
My moms couldn't afford it.
I'm offering you a scholarship.
They told me I can get 11 years for kidnapping.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You don't have control!
Robert does, 'cause I'm gonna live with him.
I can't even look Stef and Lina in the face right now.
I swore that I would never lie to them again.
Why don't you just tell them?
Do you wanna go to jail?
Because that's what would happen.
I would be taking you and Brandon down with me.
You can't tell anyone. And Stef, she's a police officer.
She can't protect you, not without risking her own career.
I think I should go live with Robert.
If this is what you truly want, we'll stand beside you.
So how soon?
Well, there's paperwork to be done, I don't know...
Probably... A few days?
How could you just let her do this?
Sweetheart, we need to respect and support Callie's decision.
We're still a family.
Families live together.
Are you sure about this?
You won't change your mind?
I can't. I told the judge.
It's not, uh...
It's not because of...
No. Brandon, no. It's...
I'm just really tired of fighting.
And, it's not like I'm not gonna be around a lot, still.
Yeah, I mean I hope so.
Well, good night.
Hey, are you awake?
Well, just in case, I just want you to know I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Daphne? Where are you?
I'm at Girls United.
Isn't it kinda late?
Look, I can't talk.
I just wanted you to know, I told the police about Tasha.
That I took her.
Daphne...
And that I did it alone.
So you and Brandon don't have to worry.
Why aren't you in juvie?
Rita made it so I could stay at Girls United, until my hearing.
Why did you...
So you don't have to go live with Robert.
It's over. You're safe.
Look, I gotta go.
Daphne...
Why aren't you dressed?
I'm not going to school.
Are you sick?
No.
Does this have to do with Callie?
No, this doesn't have anything to do with Callie.
There are other things going on in my life, you know.
I'm protesting.
In case you've forgot, you fired my favorite teacher yesterday.
I didn't... You are going to school.
No, I'm not. And it's not just me.
It's the whole sophomore class.
You are the daughter of the Vice Principal...
And a member of the Student Council.
But because you are my mother I will tell you,
we're organizing a rally for Monday.
And we're hoping for media coverage.
You want something else for breakfast, love?
Uh, no, thanks. I'm fine.
So I hear you have a girlfriend now.
What's her name? Trina?
Taylor. And she's not my girlfriend.
Well, apparently the twins aren't going to school today.
Oh, yeah, me either. The juniors are protesting, too.
Protesting what?
That mom fired Timothy.
I... Can I talk to you for a second, please?
What are we gonna do?
I'm not sure what we can do.
I need your support here.
And you have it.
But they're a little too big to carry out the front door.
I mean, I could arrest them for truancy...
This isn't funny.
Look, it's one day.
And trust me, they're gonna be so bored by the end of it
they're gonna be dying to go back to school on Monday.
Bored? With their computers and their phones and their video...
...games.
But how are we supposed to do our homework?
You have got pencils and paper and text books, don't you?
I'll be taking your phones as well, please.
I could take you off the family plan anytime I want.
What? Mom! What if we need to get in touch with you?
Use the home phone.
What if we're not home?
Oh, no. You are staying home from school, you are staying home.
Um, you do realize this means we can't record our shows, right?
Not helping. Did you get the wireless router?
Yeah, it's right there.
You're taking the Internet?
You can't do that!
Yeah, i'm pretty sure this is like unconstitutional.
You're obstructing our attempt to organize, Mama.
You can still call your comrades on the land-line.
Yeah, like we know anyone's number.
I'm not trying to shut down your protest,
just your entertainment.
Be careful!
Just take it easy.
What?
We've got our whole lives in there.
Enjoy your day off.
Hey, here. Let me help you with that.
Ok.
I'm the one that took Tasha.
And I'm the one's that's gotta pay for it.
All you and Brandon did was help me take her back.
Stef don't have to report that.
I'd still have to tell them everything.
And I'd be getting Brandon in trouble and he's got the tour...
So you're gonna go live with Robert
so Brandon can play a few gigs in some dive bars?
Girl, that's just like stupid.
It doesn't matter.
The judge isn't going to let me change my mind now, all right?
It's too late.
Daph, hey... Callie?
What are you doing here?
Come here, I got a surprise for you.
Come on.
Look who who's back at Girls United.
Word.
Yes!
A little love. Little love.
More than half the sophomores
and a good two-thirds of the juniors
either called in "sick" or just didn't show.
They're calling us dictatorial and monocratic online.
At least they know some big words.
Thanks to Timothy... in part.
Listen, I've also had quite a few calls
from parents and a few board members.
Do you think we made a mistake firing Timothy?
Well, technically I fired him.
And I certainly understand why.
You had every reason to be upset, but...
You think I was wrong?
I think you asked him to teach more non-fiction and,
yes, he was being an ass, but a complying ass.
If this were a business and an employee was that insubordinate...
This is not a business.
In an academia we encourage debate
and opinions that may differ from the administration's.
This is Anchor Beach, not Harvard, Lena.
And what this school needs to get out of debt,
is strong leadership, which it has not had.
We... We can't lead if the students have control.
So I need you to send an email
letting them and their parents know
if they are absent on Monday
without a legitimate excuse, they'll be suspended.
Suspended? Isn't that a little bit extreme?
It's not open for debate.
Either you send it, or I will.
You'll get used to it.
I just pretend like
I'm watching a super boring documentary about, like,
the mating rituals of meerkats.
And then it's like they're not even here.
Have any of you guys been to the fair yet?
It's the last weekend.
I was thinking we could all go tomorrow?
We're going to the pier, but you guys should totally go.
The fair sounds fun. We can go to the pier anytime.
I can't. I have plans with family.
What about Sunday?
Perfect. Then we can still go to the pier.
All weekend. We're going camping.
Didn't you just go camping?
We're going again.
Sorry.
So you gotta go live with your birth dad? Dang.
What's up with you?
Just glad to be outta juvie. It's messed up in there.
Girl's busting on each other like dudes.
Is Becka still in, or...?
Nah, they got her in some drug rehab last I heard.
But Gabi's back in.
She is?
She said she's seen Kiara.
Where?
South East. On El Cajon.
Damn.
What?
That ain't a street you wanna be on.
Why? What goes on there?
What, am I interrupting something?
Carmen, feet, please. What're we talking about?
Gabi saw Kiara.
On El Cajon.
Working?
What's she doing, selling drugs?
Worse.
Tory...
Tony, Gwynn.
Played right field for the Padres.
I didn't know you were into sports.
I'm not, really. But my grandfather was.
He gave it to me, before he died, so...
What do you think it's worth?
I'm not sure.
Look it up online.
Well, um, my mom sort of, uh...
took the internet away.
You know, to make sure we're not having any fun.
There are other ways to have fun.
And that's probably why you asked me over.
Well, she didn't say we had to stay home alone.
Seriously. Maybe you could sell it for enough to go on the tour.
Yeah, well, my other mom would probably kill me
and I don't know, it Kinda feels...
disrespectful, I guess, to my grandfather.
It's not like he'll ever know.
Unless you think he's looking down on you from heaven?
Well, I don't know about heaven,
but I think they can maybe see us.
So, do you think he's watching us now?
I sort of hope not.
And talk about a buzz kill.
We can do this everyday, on tour.
Just saying...
Stop talking.
We have to do something.
We're not in the business of chasing after runaways, OK?
We're not the police. This is not a prison.
If Kiara wants to turn her life around,
she's gonna have to turn herself in.
And if she does, maybe I can convince the judge
to allow her to come back here.
She only ran way because she was in a messed up foster home
and they were going to send her back there.
She didn't have a choice.
We always have a choice, you know that.
Sometimes the choice sucks,
but is she really in a better place now on the streets,
selling herself? I don't think so.
Maybe if she knew that there was a new Girls United?
Maybe. And maybe not.
But it is not our job to save Kiara.
Excuse me, ladies.
So, I was thinking, maybe next time...
Mm, you think there's going to be a next time?
Well, I kind of hope so.
Not even gonna ask. Bye.
OK, bye.
Call me.
If you're lucky.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to hack my reader, so I can get onto Facebook.
Why are you holding them like that?
So I can pick up Mr. Nesbit's Wi-Fi.
If you were an old man, what would your password be?
One, two, three, four.
Well, I don't know.
Go next door and ask for it then.
I would if he was home.
Where does a retired man go all day?
I don't know. Maybe there's a sale on Christmas decorations.
What's wrong?
I just realized that Callie won't be with us
for Christmas next year.
It's fine, I mean, she'll still be over a lot.
It's not like she's leaving the country.
Yeah, but it's not the same as living under the same roof,
seeing each other every day. That's what makes you a family.
Hey, we'll still be a family,
even when we all go to college in a couple years.
Exactly.
We're all gonna be gone. This is all we've got.
I just...
I'm not ready for things to change yet.
Yeah.
Hey, you ready?
I am.
But it looks like we're gonna have some company.
Connor's father called
and asked if he could spend the night tonight.
Why?
Because he's out of town on business and his flight got canceled.
Hey, it'll be fun.
We'll order some pizza, I'll bake some cookies.
OK?
Yeah.
OK. Uh, I've got to drop something off.
I'll meet you guys at the car.
Ok.
What happened to your family camping trip?
Free for dinner?
Uh... yeah.
So what about Idyllwild? Where are you with that?
I guess kind of nowhere.
I don't know. I really wanna go on tour.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I don't know. I wanna have some adventure.
And I'm actually really into the music we're playing.
Plus you're really into that girl too, right?
You guys getting serious?
I, uh... I guess so. Yeah.
What? What's that smirk?
Nothing, I just...
We had a good day today.
I see.
What? Don't give me that patented safe sex speech...
I wasn't going to. All right, maybe I was.
So, what, that's the reason
you're all gung-ho on the tour and all that?
No! No, I swear.
I think it'd be kind of, I don't know, like, life-changing.
Problem is, I still don't have the money, but...
Well, your mom's pretty adamant
about you guys staying in motels, so...
I don't think I'm gonna be able to change her mind on that one.
No, I mean, that wasn't what I was asking.
I was wondering, um...
if you think Mom would freak
if I sold that autographed baseball
that Grandpa gave me.
The Tony Gwynn?
Yeah, I don't know. I looked it up online.
If I sold it, I would basically be able to cover the whole tour.
But, you know, I don't know.
I don't wanna be disrespectful to Grandpa's memory either.
That's a tough one, Brandon.
So you think it'd be wrong?
I think it's your baseball.
And it's not like Grandpa gave it to you with any conditions.
And I'm not into sports, you know.
And...
I know!
Don't you think he'd want me to use it
for something I really am into?
You know, something I really want?
That was not an email, that was an act of oppression.
All we want is the chance to be heard.
And how is it you saw this act of oppression
with no access to the internet?
We got online using Mr. Nesbit's Wi-Fi.
You can pick it up in certain areas of the house.
Like the front porch.
Would you shush!
The front porch is technically part of the house.
Never said it wasn't.
And what exactly did you get online with?
Mariana hacked our readers.
What part of "Shush" Don't not understand?
Oh, I did not know you could do that.
Me either.
You can if you know how.
I gotta say, it's pretty impressive.
Right? You're like a cute Steve Jobs.
OK, all right. Can we please just change the subject?
We have a dinner guest here and I'm sure he's bored to tears.
I'm not bored.
Having dinner with just me and my dad? That's boring.
Well, that's the nice part about being in a big family.
Don't know why anyone would wanna give that up.
Mariana.
It's fine.
Well, Connor, it is very nice to have you.
It's been a long time since you've spent the night.
Not long enough.
I got an idea.
Why don't you sleep in the tent in the backyard?
And you guys can pretend like you're camping.
So now that Connor's dad assumes that Jude is straight,
it's suddenly OK for his son to spend the night?
I didn't know what to say.
He was in a bind and I was on the spot.
It's not that Connor isn't welcome...
I just can't fight another battle today.
You think Jude's OK with it?
Nah...
They have been hanging out a lot more.
Yeah, in groups.
I think he's just happy to have his best friend back.
Do you think Jude has a crush on Connor?
Oh, I don't even think Jude's sure about his sexuality.
He's questioning it, which I don't think he would do
if he was straight.
He was straight?
I don't know.
I guess kids are freer to question things these days.
You know, I just...
When I was 13, I had a crush on my best friend.
She dressed like Madonna, you know,
the leather jacket, the bracelets... Ooh!
She was the bomb! But, uh,
we were inseparable until she got a boyfriend
and I was utterly heart-broken.
Madonna?
I was more of a Whitney girl.
So how do you know that Connor doesn't have a crush on Jude?
Really? Connor doesn't seem gay to me.
Well, no one ever seems to think I seem gay.
Oh. Unlike me, I guess.
Well, the cop uniform doesn't exactly help.
Well, I'm afraid I'm going to have to arrest you then.
For what?
For profiling.
And for perpetuating sexual stereotypes.
Ahh, you're gonna have to cuff me first.
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
What?
You really think this is what Callie wants?
She says it is.
And we're just supposed to take her at her word?
I don't...
Oh, just I can't believe we're losing her.
Hey, thanks for the pajamas.
Thank Jesus.
I don't think he's very happy I'm here.
He's cool.
Are you still going to the pier tomorrow?
Nah. My dad's not gonna be back until late,
so I'm supposed to just hang here 'til he picks me up.
If that's OK?
Sure.
What are you playing?
Star Wars: Commander.
But I can't beat the Krayt Dragon.
You gotta use your Stormtroopers to lure him out.
Then you just hit it with your other troops.
Here, can I show you?
See here? This is the fastest way to get to level up.
See these, no more of these troops,
we have to bring in some of these guys over here.
And they will distract him.
Yeah, you also gotta send troops over there, too.
Nice! Good job!
Yes! We got it!
Finally.
On to the next one.
Yeah.
What's up?
Someone saw Kiara on El Cajon.
They said she's,working as a prostitute.
Oh yeah? Who's they?
A friend of Daphne's. Or someone she knows, I guess.
Well, that's a pretty rough part of town.
Rita said that there's nothing that we can do.
You talked to Rita?
Daphne did, yeah.
Well, I guess I could talk to some Vice cops,
and ask them to keep an eye out,
but short of her getting arrested...
Couldn't we go looking for her?
No. Absolutely not.
You most certainly cannot. That's a horrible part of town.
It's not just prostitution, there's a major gang presence,
and Kiara's not...
The girls working there are not working for themselves.
They have pimps, who have them brainwashed and on drugs.
And the girl that you would
find down on El Cajon is not the Kiara you know.
So please, promise me that
you will not go down there looking for her.
I won't. I promise.
Still not used to you wearing those.
Forget Steve Jobs,
you're like a cute Clark Kent.
Are you ever gonna speak to me again, or...?
Mariana, I'm sorry that you're upset...
Aren't you upset?
Of course I'm upset. You're like my sister.
I thought I was your sister. And what about Jude?
OK, Mariana, not everything is about you, OK?
And your coding and your dance team
and your frickin' abandonment issues, OK?
There are some things I just can't explain to you.
And I need you to get it, this isn't easy for me.
And just not make me feel any worse than I already do.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
Yo, baby.
Kiara.
Kiara, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
My car is parked right there.
We gotta get out of here, honey, but we gotta go now.
Let's go. Come on.
Rita...
You got people who care about you, I care about you.
You know you're better than this. Come on!
Come on...
I said I don't do bitches!
Get outta my face before I cut you!
We got a problem?
I told her I ain't no dyke!
No, we don't. I thought I knew...
I don't know you, bitch.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you are sorry.
Get outta here.
Ok.
Ok.
Nice catch.
Go back. Double play. Go again.
Three in a row.
I'm sorry.
Very funny.
Oh, sorry! That was an accident.
Oh yeah?
No. No! Go away.
Nope. No, get away.
Ok, ok.
OK, I give up!
What are you doing?
Sorry, Daria just texted me.
She wants to know if we wanna come over.
Do you?
I mean, what else is there to do?
You should go then, if you want to.
No, it's fine, we don't have to.
Whatever, just go.
I decided I don't want to go to boarding school anymore.
Why?
I'm not ready to leave home.
OK.
Are you sure you don't want to hear the guy out?
No.
Does this have something to do with your sister?
Jesus.
I can't leave her, Mom.
She's already freaking out about Callie.
If she finds out you and Mom aren't adopting Ana's baby,
she'll have a meltdown. It's like she's losing two sisters.
And then if I go away... I can't do that to her.
It's not your job to look after Mariana.
Look, Mom, I don't want to go.
Just cancel it, please?
OK. I will talk to Mom.
We've got to stop meeting like this.
Look, I'm sorry.
Ok? I...
It's my first month on the job
and I've got students staging a walkout.
I felt less pressure managing multi-million dollar businesses.
It's a hard job.
And that's why I need your help.
Hi, I'm Dan Cruz.
I'm here to meet with Jesus.
Well, no one's here...
except, a bunch of my guy friends on the football team.
Well,we had an appointment.
You had an appointment? With Jesus?
Yeah, I'm a recruiter with Flintwood Academy.
We're interested in offering your brother a scholarship.
An Academic scholarship?
Well, no. Yes.
We're also recruiting for wrestling.
Well, maybe they forgot?
Well, you can give them my card.
They can call to reschedule.
Ok.
Wait.
Where is this school?
Colorado.
See ya.
Here the kids out.
Let them have their say, even if it isn't the final one.
It makes them feel respected and who doesn't need that?
OK. We'll hear them out.
As long as they show up for school on Monday.
That sounds fair to me.
Now if I could only get my own kids to listen to reason.
What happened?
Well, if you promise not to tell anyone...
When they refused to go to school yesterday,
I... I may have packed up all their electronics, including the DVR,
and rolled it out the front door in a suitcase.
That's gotta be hard being their mom and their vice principal.
Especially when I'm not doing a great job at either.
Before you came to Anchor Beach, right before,
I was, I was five months pregnant and I lost the baby.
Lena, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's been hard, I'm not gonna lie.
Of course.
And now, our twins' birth mom is pregnant,
and she's asked Stef and me to adopt her baby.
And I feel terrible because
just a few months ago I wanted one so badly.
So how do I explain to my daughter,
who really wants us to bring this baby into the family
that... now I don't want to.
It's her half-sister.
I just feel like I'm being really selfish.
I had a miscarriage.
I was only a few months in, but if somebody had asked me
to adopt a baby just a little while later...
I wouldn't have been ready.
You need time to grieve, and...
it's not your fault.
Thank you.
That helps.
And I'm sorry about your...
Oh, thanks.
And,since we're sharing,
I guess you should know...
...Timothy was our donor.
I texted Daria back
and I told her I'm just gonna stay here.
It's not nice to lead people on.
OK, well, I'm not.
Come on.
Stop it.
Are you OK?
I didn't... I didn't mean to kick you that hard.
Why'd you kick me at all?
You kissed me, remember? In the tent?
And then at the movie theater, you held my hand.
And now, all day you've been...
I just... I don't get this.
I don't get you.
Are you OK?
Come with me.
I don't know why you're mad, I'm not going.
I'm mad because you didn't tell me.
I didn't tell you, because I'm not going.
Why not?
Because I'm not ready to leave home.
I looked it up on line.
It's a really good college prep school.
I mean, it's military,
but I can see you getting into the whole GI Joe thing.
And there's no girls, which is good.
Not for me.
Yes, for you.
Well, wait, do you want me to go?
No.
OK, well I'm not.
But I think you should.
Why?
Because I see how hard it is for you,
at school and there's so much going on around here,
you know, distractions and stuff, and...
And they want you, which is super cool.
And...
...I want what's best for you,
even if it's hard... for me.
Yes!
Just tell her to stay away.
Why don't you tell her?
I don't need nobody trying to save me. I got it good right now.
What, selling yourself on the street?
I know what you're doing. How is that good?
I don't need you judging me.
OK, OK! I'm not judging you. I'm really not.
I'm just... really scared for you.
You don't gotta be.
I finally got a roof over my head and someone who cares about me.
And there ain't no way in hell I'm going back in the system!
We're like a family.
What are you... A family?
What about Girls United? Rita's got a new house now.
And Carmen and Daphne are there.
And Rita said if you turn yourself in...
They'll take me back to juvie.
Yeah, for a few days.
But Rita's gonna call the judge and have you placed with her.
OK? That's probably what she was trying to tell you last night.
You won't ever have to go to another foster home.
You can live at Girls United until you're eighteen.
Go to school, get a diploma.
You can become a social worker, like you wanted,
and work with kids.
And I will see you all the time.
Me and Rita and Daphne, we are your family.
Please, Kiara. I can't do this without you.
I spit in her face.
Do you think she'd still want me, after that?
Oh, Rita's pretty tough. I guarantee she's took worse.
Ok.
I'll turn myself in.
But, I gotta go to my place, get some of my stuff.
No, they'll just take it from you in juvie.
Not if you keep it for me.
It's just stuff.
No, it ain't.
James bought me some nice clothes
and shoes and a diamond necklace.
You think he's just gonna let you take it all and leave?
He ain't around during the day. How you think I'm here now?
You know how it is, you've been in the system.
I never get to keep nothing.
Every time they moved me to a new foster house,
they'd take my stuff away, or they make me leave it behind.
And I ain't doing that again.
Nobody ever bought me nice things.
OK, I'm going with you.
Callie...
No, I'm not letting you go there alone.
My shift's almost over. Just wait here, OK?
I mean it. Wait here.
Ok?
Ok.
Well, I can't believe someone bought it, B. That's great!
Yeah, so all I have to do now is ship it to the buyer...
...but then I figured, why waste the postage, right?
I know your address, Dad.
I thought they shipped through the website.
You can't afford this.
Hey, it's an investment, right?
I mean, it's value's just gonna keep going up and...
...this way it stays in the family.
So you think it was wrong for me to sell it.
No, I don't think it was wrong.
I just think...
I don't know, Brandon,
I just thought maybe one day you'll regret it and then,
well, you can buy it back from me, for more than I paid.
Think of it as a loan, with collateral.
Thanks, Dad.
You ready?
So we have to take the southeast bus, right?
Yeah.
OK.
I called him.
Sorry.
No, Kiara...
Let go of me!
No, I'm not... You're just scared, Kiara...
You don't wanna mess with him.
I'm not gonna let you do this! I'm not.
You wanna get yourself beat the hell up?
Callie, just let me go!
I couldn't let you go back there. I'm sorry.
Please, don't give up on yourself.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Listen to me, it's OK.
You did the right thing. I'm proud of you for calling me, love.
Don't be proud of me.
OK, what's going on?
You need to talk to me and you need to talk to me now.
Now.
I did something wrong and I couldn't tell you.
OK. What? Why?
Because, I was afraid.
Afraid of what? Afraid we were gonna get mad
afraid you'd get in trouble?
Both, I guess. I...
I just thought...
I was afraid because I lied, again.
And because I didn't come to you again.
And because I messed up again.
I thought that maybe
that would mean that you wouldn't want me anymore.
Like you would just finally give up on me.
And is this why you're going to live with Robert?
I just I thought that if I left on my own,
it wouldn't hurt as much as if you told me to go,
but it does! It hurts so much!
OK, listen...
Hon, look at me!
Nothing you can do is gonna make us not want you.
You hear me? Nothing.
Nothing, baby.
OK.
Nothing. Come here.
Come here.
Do you hate me?
I'm glad you told them.
What if they don't let you go?
I would give up the tour
and just about anything else for you to be a part of this family.
Don't you get that by now?
I just...
I wish you'd told them before...
I know.
It'll be easier going to live with Robert,
knowing I don't have to lie about it.
I know what you did. Callie told us everything.
And if you ever tell her to lie to us again, I swear...
Look, I was just doing what I thought was best for my daughter...
Your daughter?
Yes. My daughter.
It's over.
All right? The judge has decided.
We'll see about that.
You're just wasting your time, Stef. You're too late.
Well, I'm not going down without a fight...
