good morning .
how do we turn this off ?
can you help me turn this off ?
how do we turn this off ? can you help me with this ?
oh , thank you , thank you so much . i didn &apos;t mean to snap .
good morning .
many of you are halfway through
your first week here at greendale . and as your dean ,
i thought i would
share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration .
what is community college ?
well , you &apos;ve heard all kinds of things .
you &apos;ve heard it &apos;s loser college
for remedial teens , 20 @-@ something dropouts ,
middle @-@ age divorcees ,
and old people keeping their minds active
as they circle the drain of eternity .
that &apos;s what you heard .
however , i wish you luck !
okay , you know
okay , there &apos;s more to this speech .
there &apos;s actually a middle card that is missing .
can we all look around our immediate areas ,
cause i really wanted to ...
i &apos;m only half @-@ arabic , actually .
my dad is palestinian . he &apos;s a u.s. citizen .
he &apos;s not a threat to national security or anything .
a lot of people want to know that after they meet him ,
because he has an angry energy . but not , like , angry at america .
just angry at my mom for leaving him .
although she did leave because he was angry .
and he was angry because she &apos;s american .
my name &apos;s abed , by the way .
abed , nice to know you and then meet you in that order .
now about that question that i had ?
five after eleven when you asked .
abed ?
yeah ?
what &apos;s the deal with the hot girl from spanish class ?
i can &apos;t find a road in there .
well , i only talked to her once
while she was borrowing a pencil , but ...
her name is britta , she &apos;s 28 , birthday in october .
she has two older brothers and one of &apos; em
works with children who have a disorder , i might want to look up .
oh , and she thinks she &apos;s gonna flunk tomorrow &apos;s test ,
so she really needs to focus
so she &apos;s sorry if that makes her seem cold .
holy crap .
abed ...
i see your value now .
that &apos;s the nicest thing anyone &apos;s ever said to me .
absolutely not .
if these guys knew you like i did ,
they would &apos;ve give you a small office .
jeff winger !
genius at law .
you got to stop saying that .
i will never do that . sit down .
i still cannot figure out
how you got a jury to connect september the 11th with my dui ,
let alone why that helped .
well , 2002 was a simpler time .
so what is my lawyer doing here ?
i &apos;m a student .
well , that cannot be an inspiring journey .
i am in a bit of a jam .
the state bar has suspended my license .
they found out my college degree
was less than legitimate .
i thought you had a bachelor &apos;s from columbia .
now i have to get one from america .
and it can &apos;t be an email attachment .
well , you &apos;ve picked a fine school .
yes , and i &apos;m hoping that our friendship
will yield certain advantages .
you know , academic guidance .
yes .
moral support ,
every answer to every test
for every one of the classes that i &apos;m taking .
here &apos;s my schedule .
no .
now , jeff , just by asking that ,
you have insulted the integrity of this entire institution .
waster ! not a bathroom !
not a bathroom .
okay .
duncan , you did seem less into integrity
the day that i convinced 12 of yours peers
that when you made that u @-@ turn on the freeway
and tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box
that your only real crime was loving america .
i do love america . i love it very much .
i love chalupas .
but ...
i &apos;ll look into it .
thank you .
duncan , you are a good man .
jeff , are you familiar with the adage ,
&quot; cheaters never prosper &quot; ?
no , and if i wanted to learn something ,
i wouldn &apos;t have come to community college .
hey ! spanish .
don &apos;t hit on me , okay ?
i wouldn &apos;t dream of it .
i just wanted to let you know about my spanish study group .
the guy who &apos;s playing bejeweled on his iphone all class
has a study group ?
um , can i sign up twice ?
i &apos;m taking the class as an easy credit .
i &apos;m actually a spanish tutor .
board certified .
can you say that in spanish now ?
i really need help with spanish .
yeah , i was willing to bet .
i &apos;m jeff ... or jefe .
the group meets at the library at 4 : 00 .
britta . thanks .
you &apos;re gonna be there ?
poquito mas
that means see you there .
shouldn &apos;t be too hard to fake a study group , right ?
oh , jeez , i &apos;m sorry .
i was raised on tv .
i was conditioned to believe that
every black women over 50s are cosmic mentor .
were you conditioned to pay for your damn taco , sein @-@ field ?
yes , i &apos;m so sorry . it &apos;s seinfeld .
bien-- bien-- bienvenido .
bienvenido .
hey , all right , come on in .
got the whole table .
yeah , here &apos;s the , uh ... - the whole room .
contact sheet .
just put your stuff there .
man .
rest of the group is running late .
but you and i can get acquainted .
you may have noticed this morning ,
not so good at the small talk .
yeah , i like big talk . what &apos;s your deal ?
that &apos;s not small talk ?
what &apos;s your deal and &quot; is god dead &quot; ?
all right , you want to know my deal ?
i droped out of high school
because i thought for some reason it
would &apos;ve impressed radiohead .
you &apos;d be surprised what gets back to these guys .
i , um-- i joined the peace corps .
did a little foot modeling .
i got tear gassed at a world trade rally .
marry me .
i guess , jeff
my deal is above all else , honesty .
honesty ?
yeah .
you tell me the truth , i will like you .
you lie to me , i will never talk to you again .
that &apos;s my deal .
ah , that &apos;s a good deal .
so what &apos;s your deal ?
uh , i would have to go
i would have to say , um , honesty ...
because ...
i would say anything to get what i want
and i want you to like me .
so , uh--
wow . that &apos;s a very honest answer .
all right , for now i like you fine .
really ?
wow . you &apos;re easy .
hell yeah .
abed in the house !
why ?
britta invited me . is that cool ?
oh , i can &apos;t think of a single logical reason why not .
cool .
there you go .
oh , hey , here .
put your contact info down right there .
that &apos;s right .
cool , cool , cool .
cool , cool , cool .
hey , this is kind of like &quot; breakfast club , &quot; huh ?
we are in a library .
yeah , i &apos;m sure we &apos;ve each got an issue balled up inside of us
that would make us cry if we talked about it .
do you have something balled up inside of you ?
well , i got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional .
oh . hey , text message .
let &apos;s give this bad boy read .
hey . that &apos;s probably just for you .
i &apos;ve never gotten one of these .
they &apos;re-- it &apos;s probably-- you just--
&quot; say you have to pee . i need to talk to you . &quot;
&quot; say you have to pee . &quot;
that is weird .
&quot; say you have to pee . i need to talk to you . &quot;
do you have to pee ?
no .
that &apos;s so weird .
well , i &apos;m stumped .
that &apos;s very creepy .
that makes two of us .
what &apos;s that ?
does it say you have to pee ?
no , it &apos;s just someone
with a misguided grasp of abbreviation .
i just need five minutes , you guys ,
so go ahead and study all the verbs ... in spanish .
abed ?
yeah ?
what &apos;s your read on that guy ?
you look like elisabeth shue .
just act natural . pretend you &apos;re watching the athletic proceedings .
you couldn &apos;t stop me from watching them .
there &apos;s a guy trying out for the track team
that is older than the game of poker .
he is kind of cracking .
suppose i was to say to you
it was possible to get those test answers ?
i would say , &quot; go for that , &quot;
and could have said so in a text .
i &apos;m asking you if you know the difference between right and wrong .
i discovered at a very early age
that if i talk long enough ,
i could make anything right or wrong .
so either i &apos;m god or truth is relative .
and in either case , booyah .
oh , interesting .
it &apos;s just the average person has a much harder time saying ,
&quot; booyah , &quot; to moral relativism .
duncan , you don &apos;t have to play shrink
to protect your pride .
i accept . you &apos;re chicken .
are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist ?
i am just using regular psychology on the spineless , british twit .
i &apos;m a professor . you can &apos;t talk to me that way .
a six @-@ year @-@ old girl could talk to you that way .
yes , because that would be adorable !
no , because you &apos;re a five @-@ year @-@ old girl
and there &apos;s a pecking order .
fine ! i &apos;ll do it !
thank you .
yeah , pleasure .
bye !
yes ! good !
why am i still shouting ?
i &apos;m drawing attention to myself .
you guys aren &apos;t gonna believe this ,
but the rest of the group ...
is here .
are you the board @-@ certified tutor ?
that means you do my homework , right , seacrest ?
i need to call my babysitter if we &apos;re gon &apos; be later than 10 : 00 .
what board certifies a tutor ?
where &apos;s britta ?
not sure .
but i invited more people from spanish class .
is that cool ?
it &apos;s the coolest .
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom
and bring my jacket , wallet , and keys with me .
in case there &apos;s a fire .
should we go with him ?
i &apos;m leaving my homework with slumdog millionaire over here .
that &apos;s borderline racist , i think .
and busted .
uh , listen .
now you know . i &apos;m a smoker .
yeah , but they &apos;re filtered , so that makes them safe .
you ready to get started ?
looks like the rest of your group showed up .
yeah , not mine , actually .
i think abed took out a page on craigslist .
and i was trained never to say this ...
but i think that group may be untutorable .
oh , really ?
so why don &apos;t you and i go study over some--
dinner ?
or drinks .
i think , actually , we should prioritize here
and study first and then go to dinner .
and if they really prove to be untutorable ,
we &apos;ll slip out early .
oh ... they will be ...
untutorable !
all right .
look at this crew .
all ready to study all night .
well , i can stay at least till 10 : 00 .
but who studies with strangers , right ?
my name is jeff .
jeff , it &apos;s a pleasure .
my name is pierce hawthorne and , yes ,
that is hawthorne as in hawthorne wipes ,
the award @-@ winning moist towellete .
i was just going to ask .
i &apos;m also a toast master , so perhaps
i should do the introductions .
definitely !
all right , you already know brittles .
britta .
abed . abed the arab .
is that inappropriate ?
sure .
roy . roy the wonder boy .
troy .
little princess elizabeth .
annie .
and finally , this beautiful creature is named shirley .
is that even close ?
i &apos;d like to know why i had to find out about this group on accident ?
this is getting way more like breakfast club now .
there &apos;s breakfast ?
okay , um , maybe we should get started--
you know , i &apos;ve been a part of a lot of study groups ,
that fell apart because of unresolved tension .
shouldn &apos;t we address annie &apos;s concern .
did we not invite her ?
well , annie , sweetie , it &apos;s not behind your back .
can we stop with the &quot; pumpkins &quot; and the &quot; sweeties &quot; ?
being younger does not make me inferior .
if anything , your age indicates
you &apos;ve made bad life decisions .
shirley has a response to that .
no , no , no . i don &apos;t .
you should . it looks like you do .
go ahead .
okay , okay .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ve made some bad life decisions
and maybe annie &apos;s decisions will be better .
but i think she needs to decide
whether she wants to be considered a child
or an adult , because children get pity
but not respect .
adults , they get respect ,
but they also get the back of they head grabbed
and their face pushed through jukeboxes .
ok , why don &apos;t we try learning &quot; jukebox &quot; in spanish ?
what are you doing ?
pierce !
let &apos;s discuss this creepiness .
pardon you ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m certified .
are you unaware that shirley finds your advances inappropriate ?
what advances ?
you have been sexually harassing me
since the very first day of class .
sexually harassing ? what ?
that makes no sense to me .
why would i harass somebody who turns me on ?
saying she turns you on is the harassment , dude .
i am a prominent business leader
and a highly sought after dinner guest ...
and i will not take courting advice
from some teenage boy .
well , this teenage boy
is a quarterback and a prom king .
you &apos;re not prom king anymore , troy .
this isn &apos;t riverside high .
how &apos;d you know i went there ?
because you &apos;re still wearing your stupid letter jacket .
and more importantly , i sat behind you in the algebra !
well , you &apos;re the girl that got hooked on pills and then dropped out .
you &apos;re little annie adderall .
yes , and you are a stupid jock
who lost his scholarship by dislocating
both shoulders in a keg stand .
keg flip .
they &apos;re very hard to pull off .
you don &apos;t know-- i &apos;m a legend .
you know what i got for christmas ?
it was a banner year at the bender family .
i got a carton of cigarettes .
the old man grabbed me , he said ,
&quot; hey , smoke up , johnny ! &quot;
&quot; no , dad ! what about you ? &quot;
well , uh ... that--
that actually was from the &quot; breakfast club . &quot;
&quot; nobody puts baby in the corner . &quot;
&quot; dirty dancing . &quot;
hello ?
it &apos;s professor duncan .
come to the parking lot now .
what &apos;s wrong with your voice ?
i &apos;m disguising it .
uh , i &apos;ll be right back .
but while i &apos;m gone , you guys need
to hash this stuff out .
no stone unturned .
go !
get in the car !
act as if we &apos;ve either just finished or yet to begin driving .
every answer to every test
in your curriculum this semester .
i knew you could do it , buddy .
thank you .
whoa there , grabby @-@ grabby .
what do i get ?
the satisfaction of being even .
even , fairness , right , wrong .
there is no god . booyah , booyah .
what do you want from me ?
your lexus .
my car for a semester &apos;s worth of answers ?
will it be just a semester though , jeff ?
won &apos;t you be taking the easy way out
for the next four years ?
i want payment in advance .
i want leather seats with built @-@ in ball warmers .
you know , bluffs this weak are how
your people lost the colonies .
have a nice disbarment hearing .
what am i supposed to drive ?
why don &apos;t you take this car ? it &apos;s good for the earth .
yeah , so is wiping your butt with a leaf ,
but it &apos;s not how a man gets around !
a golf kart !
it is a disaster in there .
yeah , untutorable .
you like thai food ? i love thai food .
wait , so this is a game to you ?
you put human beings into a state
of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants ?
why can &apos;t you see that for the compliment that it is ?
okay , okay , okay . i &apos;m sorry .
it was an accident .
i did a little bit of lying to get close to you .
but how was i supposed to know that you were smart and cool .
i mean , you look like elisabeth shue .
you &apos;re unbelievable .
what do you want me to do ?
oh , maybe one decent thing could be
to go in there and clean up your mess .
okay , i am the barack obama of this room .
okay , if i do that , then dinner , right ?
yeah , fine , whatever .
as if there &apos;s a dinner on earth that could
make me forget you are a shallow douchebag .
oh , you &apos;re gonna eat those words when you see my new car .
all right , everybody !
i want to say something .
sit down .
you don &apos;t have to yell . i don &apos;t appreciate your tone .
you know what makes humans different from other animals ?
feet .
no , no , no , come on . bears have feet .
we &apos;re the only species on earth
that observes shark week .
sharks don &apos;t even observe shark week ,
but we do .
for the same reason i can pick up this pencil ,
tell you it &apos;s name is steve , and go like this .
and part of you dies just a little bit on the inside ,
because people can connect with anything .
we can sympathize with a pencil .
we can forgive a shark .
and we can give ben affleck
an academy award for screenwriting .
big mistake .
he &apos;s got a point .
people can find the good
in just about anything but themselves .
look at me .
it &apos;s clear to all of you that i am awesome ,
but i can never admit that ,
because that would make me an ass .
but what i can do is see what makes annie awesome .
she &apos;s driven .
we need driven people or the lights go out
and the ice cream melts .
and pierce .
we need guys like pierce .
this guy has wisdom to offer .
the dalai lama and i--
we should listen to him sometime .
we wouldn &apos;t regret it .
and shirley .
shirley has earned our respect ,
not as a wife , not as a mother ,
but as a woman .
and don &apos;t test her on that ,
because that thing about the jukebox
was way too specific to be improvised .
and troy .
who cares if troy thinks he &apos;s all that ?
maybe he is .
you think astronauts go to the moon
because he hate the oxygen ?
no , they are trying to impress
their high school prom king .
and abed .
abed &apos;s a shaman .
you ask him to pass the salt ,
he gives you a bowl of soup , because you know what ?
soup is better .
abed is better .
you are all better than you think you are .
you are just designed not to believe it
when you hear it from yourself .
soup ?
i want you to look to the person to your left .
sorry .
look at the person sitting next to you .
look at her ? okay .
this ?
yeah .
i want you to extend to that person
the same compassion that you extend
the sharks , pencils , and ben affleck .
i want you to say to that person ,
&quot; i forgive you . &quot;
i forgive you .
i forgive you .
i forgive you .
you little twerp .
pierce , i &apos;d like you to say , &quot; i forgive you . &quot;
he didn &apos;t say it ?
i forgive you .
you &apos;ve just stopped being a study group .
you have become something unstoppable .
i hereby pronounce you a community .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
i like that .
this isn &apos;t like &quot; breakfast club &quot; anymore .
now it &apos;s like &quot; stripes &quot; or &quot; meatballs . &quot;
anything with bill murray , really .
i agree with abed that tonight has been very special .
and now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have a dinner engagement with britta .
britta ?
i lied .
thanks for calming everyone down .
but since you &apos;re not a spanish tutor ,
just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone
in an attempt to get with me ,
i &apos;d appreciate it if you left
and stopped wasting all of our time .
everybody ready ?
fine .
and i &apos;m happy to report
that one of the benefits of being a lying creep
is having all the answers to tomorrow &apos;s test .
and i &apos;m happy to share them with anyone
whose time i &apos;ve wasted more than
they &apos;ve wasted mine .
uh , jeff , if you have all the answers ,
why the hell did you start this study group ?
i don &apos;t have a study group , pierce .
i made it up .
what about the &quot; look left &quot; speech ?
made it up . that &apos;s what i do .
i make things up , and i got paid a lot of money
to do it before i came to this school @-@ shaped toilet .
i was a lawyer .
oh , god .
that explains everything .
you know , i thought you were like bill murray in any of his films ,
but you &apos;re more like michael douglas in any of his films .
yeah ?
yeah .
well , you have asperger &apos;s .
what &apos;s that mean ?
&quot; ass burger . &quot;
it &apos;s a serious disorder .
it really is .
if it &apos;s so serious
why don &apos;t they call it meningitis ?
yeah .
&quot; ass burger . &quot;
burger for your ass .
jeffrey , before you say anything ,
you may want to think about the gift you &apos;ve been given .
an excuse to punch a hippy ?
no . no , not that .
an important lesson , my friend .
you see , the tools you acquired to survive out there
will not help you here at greendale .
what you have , my friend ,
is a second chance at an honest life .
why are people trying to teach me things
at a school that has an express tuition aisle ?
give me my keys .
no , i have to keep the car for the lesson-- the less--
don &apos;t hit me . please , don &apos;t hit me .
jeffrey ?
jeffrey , are we cool ?
are we cool ?
we cool .
i like you , jeffrey .
you remind me of myself at your age .
i deserve that .
you know ,
i &apos;ve been divorced seven times .
sometimes i think i &apos;m doing something wrong .
you keep getting married .
i never looked at it that way .
shouldn &apos;t you guys be studying ?
yeah , things got kind of boring after you left .
let me ask you something .
people been clowning me about this jacket since i got here , but ...
if i take it off to make them happy ,
that just makes me weak , right ?
listen .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you lose the jacket to please them .
you keep it to piss them off .
either way it &apos;s for them .
that &apos;s what &apos;s weak .
you just wrinkled my brain , man .
he &apos;s good , isn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s real good .
shouldn &apos;t you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers ?
i don &apos;t have any of the answers .
i &apos;m gonna-- i &apos;m gonna flunk the test .
you just , like , study for , like , an hour .
it &apos;s not that hard .
you seem pretty smart . you got a sports coat .
well , the funny thing about being smart
is that you can get through most of life
without ever having to do any work . so , uh ...
i &apos;m not really sure how to do that .
what &apos;s going on ?
can you guys hear me ? am i deaf ?
can you hear me talking right now ?
yes .
yes ?
that &apos;s good .
you know what ?
jeff , actually , we didn &apos;t get that far without you ,
so if you want to come back upstairs--
really ?
well , it is your study group , so .
come on , let &apos;s study .
sounds good .
no pressure .
i &apos;m sorry i called you michael douglas
and i see your value now .
well , that &apos;s the nicest thing anyone &apos;s ever said to me .
