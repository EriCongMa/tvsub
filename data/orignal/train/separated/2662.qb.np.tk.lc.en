rubber baby buggy bumpers .
lady , you sure this is the place ?
rubber baby buggy bumpers .
this is my bitcoin wallet address .
as soon as a transaction is confirmed , she &apos;ll be released .
as you know , the american government refuses
to negotiate with terrorists ,
which is why the palmer family contracted my firm
to negotiate on their behalf .
what is this ?
my bitcoin wallet address .
you don &apos;t pay the ransom , she dies .
you and i both know miss palmer isn &apos;t here , karokaro .
you know it because you never had any intention
of giving her to me ,
and i know it because i &apos;ve already set her free .
call your man at the port . you have a situation .
an hour ago , a strike team raided your holding site
at muara angke .
they took miss palmer ,
along with the other eight workers you were holding ,
so the kidnapping part of the story &apos;s over ,
which leaves us with the business at hand .
you &apos;re not ransoming me . i &apos;m ransoming you .
and the amount is $ 3 million , not $ 1 million .
i don &apos;t know if it bothers you telling people things
they don &apos;t want to hear ,
but it makes me uncomfortable ,
which is ironic because most people think i &apos;m a bully .
they think i enjoy it , being blunt ,
making people feel small ,
but nothing could be further from the truth .
years ago , i @-@ i suffered an unspeakable loss .
and since then ,
i &apos;ve been crippled by free @-@ floating anxieties
that attach to pretty much anything .
some days i @-@ i can &apos;t even get out of bed .
i haven &apos;t slept through the night in two years .
4 a.m. , i &apos;m up doing sudoku .
normally , i @-@ i delegate a meeting like this
because , uh , conflict , it &apos;s debilitating .
but i &apos;m working on the power of positive confrontation .
i @-@ i haven &apos;t brushed up on my indonesian in a while ,
but i &apos;m going to guess he &apos;s telling you
your brother &apos;s being held hostage by my people .
true .
if you want to see your brother alive again ,
you &apos;re gonna transfer the money .
the number &apos;s $ 3 million .
would you take cash ?
put it down .
tom , i want to speak with you about your daughter .
what happened with hargrave ?
even if you don &apos;t want me to have contact
with elizabeth &apos;s child --
hargrave . did you get her ?
i have virtually unlimited resources .
i want you to know that those resources
are at your disposal in the raising of agnes .
i don &apos;t want your money . i don &apos;t want your protection .
i want answers .
the woman who killed liz ,
you walked right into her trap after i warned you .
what happened ?
alexander kirk .
i don &apos;t know who that is .
the man who ordered the attack on your wedding .
he &apos;s ultimately responsible for elizabeth &apos;s death .
i &apos;m going to find him .
no , no , susan hargrave --
was a contractor . a hired hand .
tom , until i end this ,
your only concern is to keep agnes safe .
i &apos;m gonna help you find him .
absolutely not .
he &apos;ll come for her , for agnes .
yes .
i can &apos;t stand by and watch that happen .
you want me to accept your offer to help with agnes ,
then you need to accept my help with this .
so , tell me about alexander kirk .
alexander kirk is the alias of an oligarch
who made a fortune after the fall of the soviet union
buying mining operations for pennies on the dollar .
in 2002 , he went into hiding
after falling out of favor with the kremlin .
he owes his survival
to some of the world &apos;s most powerful politicians
whose careers he secretly bankrolls .
but alexander kirk is the man responsible for elizabeth &apos;s death .
he hired susan hargrave to abduct her ,
which is why we need to work with hargrave to find him .
work with her ?
how about arrest her ?
this sounds like a bad idea .
until it &apos;s not .
the aid workers who were abducted in jakarta ?
your government refused to pay the ransom ,
turned its back on three young people
who were captured for doing nothing more
than providing medical services to the poor .
today , they &apos;re home because susan hargrave committed
what your government considers to be a crime
in order to get them back .
she &apos;s a brilliant strategist .
and if we want to get alexander kirk ,
we &apos;re going to need her help to do it .
his finances are the way in .
kirk &apos;s holdings are out of reach .
the caymans , zurich .
they were out of reach until citizens united .
kirk has personally financed
a 501c4 super pac
in support of senator robert diaz &apos;s presidential bid .
how much ?
it &apos;s hard to tell .
it &apos;s all dark money , but i believe it &apos;s north of $ 300 million .
diaz is the front @-@ runner .
if he gets elected ,
kirk &apos;s reach will extend into the white house .
i &apos;m impressed .
like i care .
if we steal diaz &apos;s money , kirk won &apos;t be far behind .
him and everyone else .
it &apos;s a presidential campaign .
if that money goes missing ,
everyone on the planet will take notice .
you make it sound so fun .
what about the husband , tom keen ?
he thinks i &apos;m responsible for the death of his wife .
i think you &apos;re responsible for her death .
i &apos;m looking past that because i want alexander kirk &apos;s head .
and so does tom keen .
i must admit i &apos;ve never liked you , scottie .
looking at you makes my toes curl .
but robbing the next president of the united states ,
this is gonna be a gas .
rubber baby buggy bumpers .
rubber baby buggy bumpers .
rubber baby ...
my , what a dear , sweet child .
how did you get in here ?
with a seven @-@ figure donation that built this wing .
the grasp of these tiny fingers .
i &apos;d forgotten .
i understand we &apos;re gonna be working together
to find the man who took elizabeth from you .
you took her from me .
no . alexander kirk did .
he &apos;s why i &apos;m here ,
to tell you i &apos;m putting the full resources of my company
behind the effort to find kirk and bring him to justice .
give me my little girl .
she &apos;s all i care about .
i remember my little one looking up at me ,
eyes full of wonder .
they say losing a child is something one never recovers from .
i hope you never experience that kind of loss .
for the moment , we have a common enemy , so ...
i &apos;ll work with you .
you have a lovely child .
10 minutes . i &apos;ll send solomon to pick you up .
got a lot of work to do .
i hope you &apos;re a chocoholic , my friend .
we &apos;re going to the chocolate factory .
let me say one thing . i &apos;m not your friend .
what the hell is this place ?
this is what happens when the government outsources 70 %
of its intelligence budget .
you &apos;re 150 feet below the largest privately owned
tactical training center in the country ,
complete with r &amp; d labs ,
ship @-@ boarding simulators , and two airfields .
we do threat assessment , port security ,
and diplomatic training ,
and those are just the services that the public knows about --
the black @-@ and @-@ white divisions .
then ... there &apos;s grey matters .
grey matters handles the cases
that are legally questionable , yet morally justifiable .
you &apos;re late . she &apos;s not happy .
promise you won &apos;t kick my ass .
&apos;cause she could kick my ass .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
i thought i could , but i can &apos;t .
remember , we &apos;re doing this for elizabeth .
yeah , but they &apos;re the same people who killed her .
you !
navabi !
if i can do this , so can you .
enough ! we &apos;re on the clock .
alexandre , j &apos;essaie de vous protéger .
sans autorisation formelle ...
i don &apos;t need your protection .
after the u.s. election , approval will be a formality .
i just spoke to d.c.
we have a confirmed location of the child .
i want this done today .
the way to get kirk &apos;s attention is through his money ,
and the only money we can get to is sitting in diaz &apos;s war chest ,
which is unfortunate
for the bloviating senator from missouri
because he cannot win the election without it ,
and we &apos;re gonna steal it .
the bureau prevents bank robberies . we don &apos;t commit them .
senator diaz &apos;s success in november
rests on winning three key swing states .
to do that , futures america ,
a pac financed by alexander kirk ,
intends to purchase over $ 300 million in tv ads
from now until election day .
the money is wired to media outlets via a secure terminal
from a single account at key atlantic bank in manhattan .
to get the money ,
we need to access the terminal from the server room .
the good news is we can take the bank in under two minutes .
the bad news is the second we walk in ,
any teller can trip a silent alarm
that will lock down the area of the bank
where the secure terminal is located .
so we won &apos;t be able to access it before the police arrive .
that &apos;s it ? your plan is awful .
it &apos;s brilliant . the robbery is a show .
you want the police to arrive , followed by the fbi .
the heist gets you in , gives you time to access the terminal --
we rob the bank while everyone else thinks
that we are trying to find the robbers .
thanks , but no thanks .
you work with the single most sought @-@ after criminal in america .
thanks to you , he &apos;s not only free ,
his criminal empire &apos;s expanding .
you , all of you , have proven quite capable
of parking your selective morality when the moment serves .
i suggest finding elizabeth keen &apos;s killer
is just such a moment .
it &apos;s &quot; badges in the drawer &quot; time , people .
this is a revenge movie .
mr. loescher , we sent out a foreclosure letter
three weeks ago .
no , i have the paperwork in my car .
y @-@ you never sent me a --
just hold on . i can show you .
sadie .
sadie , don &apos;t move , okay ? i &apos;ll be right back .
hope you don &apos;t need my help in there
&apos;cause you &apos;re not getting it .
party time .
on the floor !
ladies and gentlemen ,
we are your friendly neighborhood bank robbers ,
except we &apos;re not friendly ,
and this sure as hell ain &apos;t our neighborhood .
i need everyone to slide their cellphones to the center of the room .
come on .
anyone wanting to know what happens
if you ignore my instructions , come speak to me directly .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
just stay down . stay down .
daddy .
yes , that &apos;s right . a robbery right now .
key atlantic bank . my little girl &apos;s in there .
call just came in to dispatch .
one police plaza path responding .
call &apos;s in . start your clocks .
key card and vault combination .
silent alarm was just tripped .
let &apos;s go .
daddy .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , okay ?
put it down .
don &apos;t be a hero , baby . 60 seconds , and we &apos;re ghosts .
nypd . i said put your gun down .
no , no , no , no . you don &apos;t want to do this .
55 seconds .
put down your gun !
no , you put your damn gun down !
it &apos;s just a flesh wound . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
oh , my god , she &apos;s bleeding .
it hurts .
okay , hold on .
okay , we need a medic right now .
patrol response en route .
ambulances will be dispatched as part of the response .
no , they won &apos;t enter until police secure the sight .
she can &apos;t wait that long .
40 seconds .
my wife is dead because of you .
i &apos;m not gonna let this little girl die , too .
we got to clear , now .
30 seconds .
responding units on site .
i need a paramedic .
nearest unit is on fulton and pearl ,
heading south .
that &apos;s too far .
my god , my little girl !
no , no , no !
are you okay ?
that &apos;s the father . hold on , hold on .
dad , with me . now .
okay .
we got to keep pressure on the wound .
all right .
all right ?
yeah .
all right .
keep pressure on the wound . can you do it ?
yeah .
this is a bad idea .
give me the keys .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
paramedics approaching john street .
what &apos;s her name ?
sadie .
all right , sadie , just listen to your dad .
all right ? everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
we &apos;re gonna get you to a doctor ,
and everything &apos;s gonna be just fine .
hold on .
where &apos;s my ambulance ?
pearl and cedar , southbound .
i got her . that &apos;s alright .
baby , you &apos;ll be okay . you &apos;ll be okay .
i got a gunshot , lower left abdomen .
in five !
let &apos;s go .
tell me you &apos;re not okay with this .
i wouldn &apos;t be if i had a better idea , but i don &apos;t .
special agents ressler and navabi .
first responders indicated that the robbers
knew exactly what they were looking for ?
yeah , it was a classified diplomatic pouch
owned by the saudi government .
do you have any security feeds ?
of course . um , this way .
so , nothing else was taken ?
stupid , right ?
you &apos;d think they &apos;d take something else to mislead us .
i &apos;ll catch up with you .
okay , uh , the server room is across from the cfo &apos;s office ,
second door from the end of the hall , right @-@ hand side .
i see servers .
i &apos;m gonna need you to be a little more specific than that .
okay . many servers .
are any of them connected to a modem or a screen ?
there &apos;s a keyboard .
great . that &apos;s the server the terminal &apos;s connected to .
follow the cable and insert , uh , you know , the , uh --
your dongle ?
yes . uh , well , it &apos;s not mine , but , uh , yeah .
okay . your dongle has been inserted .
now we have remote access .
you &apos;re brute @-@ forcing this thing ?
yeah , how else am i gonna generate
the bank president &apos;s password ?
what , are you data @-@ mining his social media ?
you can &apos;t generate enough personal details
to create a useful password dictionary .
classic .
field gets the glory , support gets the job done .
okay , as soon as i enter the password ,
we should have access to the funds .
需要视网膜扫描
or not . it &apos;s requesting a retinal scan .
looks like we &apos;ve got ourselves a two @-@ key system .
tasty .
what happened ? !
hey ! hold up ! stop !
where is she ? where &apos;s my daughter ?
where &apos;s my daughter ?
where &apos;s my daughter ? !
sir , you &apos;re not allowed to go in there .
we take three types of contributions --
big , dark , and anonymous .
which if he loses , also describes senator diaz .
i &apos;m screwing with you , robert . come on .
we &apos;re supposed to be having fun here tonight ,
and raising money for the next president of the united states ,
senator robert diaz .
thank you .
oh , well , thank you , scottie .
i know i speak for everyone here when i say ,
good god , i wish howard had given that introduction .
well , i understand he &apos;s off working on , well ...
mrs. hargrave thinks you may be more comfortable
if i knew what it was , you &apos;d have to kill me .
waiting in her office .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
my daughter -- where is she ? - showing up uninvited .
do you have any idea who some of those people are ?
i don &apos;t care ! they said you took her !
tonight is important to me .
a nurse is dead ,
a 7 @-@ year @-@ old girl was shot in the robbery .
sadie loescher ,
a second grader at ps @-@ 126,
is resting comfortably in a private room at mount sinai
thanks to the work of a renowned vascular surgeon
whose schedule miraculously cleared up in time
to remove six bullet fragments lodged in her sacrum .
if you &apos;re thinking of sending flowers , don &apos;t -- she &apos;s allergic .
but she loves dark chocolate .
what did you do with my little girl , huh ?
my people received word kirk was on the move .
i alerted the fbi , and because of it , more people weren &apos;t hurt .
your daughter is safe ,
and she &apos;s getting the medical attention she needs .
now , if you &apos;re finished ,
the next president of the united states
is waiting downstairs for me .
robbing key atlantic got us
the first of two authentications we need to access kirk &apos;s funds .
peter pruitt is the second .
as president of airborne fidelity ,
pruitt manages assets worth over $ 4 billion
belonging to fugitives like alexander kirk .
he &apos;s also treasurer of futures america .
ah , so he &apos;s the good old boy
that funnels kirk &apos;s millions into the pac .
yes , and no withdrawals over $ 250,000 can be made
without a biometric scan of his eyes .
pruitt &apos;s in berlin staying at the turkish embassy
as a guest of the ambassador .
he &apos;ll attend a reception at the embassy for the g8 ministers .
we need a biometric scan of pruitt &apos;s eyes ,
which are in that embassy .
getting in during the g8 summit means
getting past an a @-@ list security system and a small army .
good luck with that .
eugene pavlenko .
i don &apos;t know who that is .
me .
pavlenko is a fugitive wanted in turkey
on money @-@ laundering charges .
when the id gets flagged by interpol ,
it will require my provisional arrest .
once that happens , officials in ankara
will immediately insist that i am transported to --
to the turkish embassy .
where they will file a formal request for extradition .
柏林
even if they do take you into the embassy ,
you &apos;ll never get a retinal scanner inside .
i &apos;m not bringing a scanner in .
i &apos;m bringing pruitt out .
how ?
i &apos;m gonna poison him .
dumont , sending you feeds from the embassy security .
capturing video now , creating a loop and uploading .
guards should be blind in five , four ...
all clear .
♬ papa was a rolling stone ♬
smokes , key card .
♬ wherever he laid his hat was his home ♬
when you exit , make two lefts ,
and the first door on your right should be a stairwell
♬ and when he died , all he left us was alone ♬
that takes you to a third floor .
almost there .
♬ oh , oh , papa was a rolling stone ♬
you got two swallows overhead .
♬ my son , yeah ♬
♬ wherever he laid his hat was his home ♬
on you in four , three , two ...
♬ and when he died , all he left us was alone ♬
hurry ! hurry ! hurry !
the kitchen will give you access to the ballroom via the south door .
champagne ?
danke .
he &apos;s the mark . why are you walking away ?
i have to tell you .
that is just the most amazing tie .
what the hell is wrong with you , you clumsy idiot ? !
look , do we -- i ...
can you talk to somebody
about getting me another shirt , will you ?
okay .
jesus .
scotch .
let me help you , sir .
you speak english ?
okay , we got a situation .
you &apos;ve got to get out of there now .
my father was american .
two packs a day , unfiltered .
got to be careful . those things can kill you .
so can mouthing off at guests .
know your place , kid .
they know . you need to get out .
now .
what is this ?
told you those things would kill you .
time to go to work .
just hold him still so i can get a scan .
maybe if you dosed him properly .
i was trying to put him to sleep ,
not kill the poor bastard . just hold him still .
you have landespolizei units approaching to your south .
proceed to wilhelmstrasse and switch to frequency 126.420 .
okay , i &apos;m transmitting the scan now .
需要视网膜扫描
do it again .
i can &apos;t do it again . they got a lockout protocol in place .
yes , agent mojtabai speaking .
the retinal scan &apos;s being rejected
because of your connection , cheesecake .
get ready , kids . we &apos;ve been spotted .
we need to dump this vehicle .
uh , dumont , uh , i think i figured it out .
aram !
tom , hey . how cool is this ?
i didn &apos;t expect to talk to you until agnes &apos; baptism .
bless me , father , for we need to get on with it .
guys !
right . uh , sorry .
they said you , uh , drugged pruitt ?
yeah , 200 micrograms of fentanyl .
exactly , an opiate narcotic will cause the pupils
to be constricted to pinpoint size , and the scanner --
retinal scanner requires light to analyze the back of the eye .
if not enough light passes into the constricted pupils --
the scanner &apos;s unable to detect the retinal signature .
okay , the bad news -- i just dosed him again .
i don &apos;t even know if he &apos;s got pupils right now .
but if we wait
waiting isn &apos;t an option .
we need to counteract the meds .
how do we do that ?
tropicamide .
it &apos;s what eye doctors use to dilate your pupils .
6 @-@ 3 , we &apos;re taking a detour .
tropicamide . got it .
this one &apos;s on you , kid .
we &apos;re only in this situation because --
we are in this situation because you attacked my wedding .
you &apos;re right .
but you and i both know that your wife is in a much better place .
that &apos;s for my wife .
drive !
where &apos;s solomon ?
i said drive !
aram . get keen on the line .
little busy right now .
just got off the phone with fincen .
key atlantic &apos;s been notified of pruitt &apos;s abduction ,
and the bank president &apos;s on his way there now .
he &apos;s gonna freeze the account , lock us out .
i don &apos;t have the scan yet .
well , get it . he &apos;s gonna be there any minute .
i got dumont on the line .
yeah , let me guess . the bank president &apos;s on his way .
according to the security
feeds in the building , he &apos;s already there .
you got less than a minute to get that money , honey .
all right ! all right ! i &apos;m doing it .
uploading now .
are you getting it ?
dumont ?
he &apos;s trying to lock us out .
dumont !
got it . we &apos;re in .
starting the transfer .
kirk &apos;s money is on its way .
as soon as the scans verify , the funds are ours .
it &apos;s gonna be close , sweet cheeks .
reddington . it &apos;s time .
get pruitt on the phone .
yes , i know he was attacked .
by the people who took our money !
hello , robert .
tough day .
scottie ?
you heard about the money .
please , please tell me you know what happened .
oh , i know exactly what happened . i took it .
you did ?
you wrote me a $ 50,000 check .
you have to give to get .
i gave , now i got .
well , technically , we got .
senator !
having taken your money , i won &apos;t take much of your time .
unlike scottie , i have little use for politicians
and even less for their politics .
who occupies the white house is of no interest to me .
i tell you this so you know that taking your money
has nothing to do with you or what you stand for .
truth be told , i haven &apos;t the foggiest clue
what you stand for , senator .
i &apos;m calling the police .
might be more prudent to call alexander kirk .
i &apos;m sure you have a contributor of his stature on speed dial .
call him .
senator diaz .
senator , what a pleasure .
i have your money .
i have your senator .
do you know what i &apos;m thinking , raymond ?
that house by the water ,
holding a gun in your mouth
i should have pulled the trigger .
so , you have my money and my senator .
you don &apos;t have me .
look , i did what you asked . just ...
tomorrow morning , you &apos;re gonna hold a press conference
to announce you &apos;re taking a moment away from the campaign trail
to compel billionaire alexander kirk
to testify about some of his business activities
before the congressional committee you chair .
why are you doing this ?
oh , spare us the moral outrage , bob .
we &apos;re doing you a favor .
if you get kirk here , reddington can have him .
once he has him , you get your illegal money back ,
laundered through anonymous contributions
made to the pac of your choice .
i am not gonna be an accomplice to murder .
you are if you want to be president .
i know , the christening . we &apos;re coming .
no , no . no , no , no .
i mean ... yes totally , but .
diaz . he subpoenaed kirk .
he is forcing him to come to d.c.
we &apos;re gonna get him .
reddington must have got his hands on kirk &apos;s money .
he &apos;s gonna use it against him .
when this started , kirk was the criminal
who was going to be controlling the next president .
now it &apos;s reddington .
oh , look at her .
she is so beautiful .
and that little dress .
you know , liz and i never really had a family
♬ they didn &apos;t have you where i come from ♬
until we met you guys .
albeit a slightly dysfunctional family ,
the kind where you try to kill each other occasionally .
♬ never knew the best was yet to come ♬
but a family nonetheless .
this year especially .
you guys really came together for ...
♬ life began when i saw your face ♬
... for liz .
just like i know you would for agnes .
♬ and i hear your laugh like a serenade ♬
so , it didn &apos;t take a genius to decide
who liz would want to godparent our little girl .
♬ how long ♬
she &apos;d want all of you .
♬ do you want to be loved ♬ ♬
♬ is forever enough ♬ ♬
♬ is forever enough ♬ ♬
♬ how long do you want to be loved ♬ ♬
♬ is forever enough ♬ ♬
♬ &apos; cause i &apos;m never , never giving you up ♬
mrs. hargrave &apos;s not here .
i &apos;ll wait .
yeah .
don &apos;t do it .
there &apos;s nothing left to do .
tom .
we needed the money to get to kirk .
we got it . we have no use for her anymore .
if you kill her , the answers you &apos;ve been looking for
your entire life will die with her .
what are you talking about ?
i remember my little one
looking up at me , eyes full of wonder .
my mother .
yes .
which is why i didn &apos;t want you involved .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
you have a child to raise , tom .
if you start asking questions ,
it will put her at risk , it will put you at risk .
but her son is dead . she told me that herself .
christopher hargrave went missing
when he was only 3 years old .
christopher ... hargrave . is that my name ?
susan hargrave genuinely believes her son is dead .
so , she has no idea who i am ?
what , did somebody fake my death ...
and hide me from her all these years ?
w @-@ why would anybody do that ?
listen to me , tom .
susan hargrave has many secrets .
some of them concern you .
if you want answers ,
you must conceal your true identity .
my perfect baby boy .
he loved the water .
found that necklace in a trinket shop
during a trip to ocean city .
we had rented a house that summer ,
spent the whole week on the beach building sand castles
with drawbridges and moats .
that night , howard and i had a ... big fight .
too much to drink .
next morning , christopher was gone .
the police searched everywhere , but ...
nothing . he was just ... gone .
like his castle .
it &apos;s been 28 years ,
and not a day goes by where i don &apos;t walk into a room ...
hoping , praying he &apos;ll be there .
please tell me you &apos;re not gonna try and kill me again .
that &apos;s exactly what i came here to do .
but for my daughter &apos;s sake , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
you &apos;re hired .
sorry , what ?
you want me to work for you ?
in my experience ,
there &apos;s a very fine line between love and hate .
we could do incredible things together .
i &apos;m sorry about your son .
