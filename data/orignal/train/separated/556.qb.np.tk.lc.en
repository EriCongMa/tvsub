第五季第二集
hi everybody . i &apos;m jeff . mr. winger
and this is fundamental of law .
any questions ?
you , red hair . i &apos;m not gonna learn names .
will there be a syllabus ?
&quot; will there be a syllabus ? &quot;
is good example of a question . moving on .
ski cap .
how are we gonna be graded ?
oh , no spoilers , ski cap .
maybe we better do names .
dave .
what percent of our grade will the final be ?
come on , guys , percentages , grades , that syllabus thing ...
are we human beings or just question @-@ and @-@ answer machines ?
we &apos;re students . and you &apos;re a teacher .
yeah . i &apos;m a teacher .
did you see that ? that teacher just leered at me .
ew .
hey , look ,
it &apos;s the star of &quot; head of the ass . &quot;
shut up , leonard ! nice earring .
you look like the road manager for the california raisins .
whoa ! what kind of teacher talks to a student like that ?
right ?
yeah .
fresh meat , huh ?
yeah , jeff winger , law .
buzz hickey , criminology .
you can have that half of the office , but come spring ,
that corner is stacked to the rafters with fetal pigs .
i won &apos;t be here that long .
this is sort of a temporary gig for me .
i get it .
teaching to make ends meet until a real job comes along ,
yeah , me too .
oh , cool .
how long have you been ...
15 years .
15 years and counting .
&quot; temporary gig . &quot;
oh , i like you .
oh , the new table turned out great , abed .
splendid varnishing .
&quot; table mark ii &quot; ?
i added that , and a few custom upgrades .
it &apos;s voice activated .
table , resume table mode .
table , power down .
wait ! i got a cup on there .
oh , teacher man !
it &apos;s professor winger !
mr. winger .
please don &apos;t razz me about being a teacher .
teaching is the most noble profession in the world .
yeah , tell that to the guy that shares my office .
he fixes cuckoo clocks for fun .
that sounds like mr. hickey , my criminology professor .
i certainly hope you &apos;ll be a better teacher than him .
annie , i don &apos;t know law .
i wasn &apos;t a real lawyer , remember ?
i can &apos;t just pretend i &apos;m teaching .
i &apos;m not mythbusters .
there &apos;s a two @-@ day course
called &quot; nicolas cage : good or bad . &quot;
i &apos;m signing up . i &apos;ve always wanted to know .
nicolas cage is one of pop culture &apos;s greatest mysteries .
oh , there &apos;s a course on nicolas cage ,
but if you mention jesus to your science teacher ,
you get a written warning .
well , jesus wasn &apos;t in 70 movies .
i &apos;m in . cage class , sounds fun .
jeff , you don &apos;t have time to take a blow @-@ off class .
you need to figure out what you &apos;re gonna
teach your students .
thanks , annie ,
for one glorious second , i forgot i was a teacher .
oh ! look at mr. smarty pants !
i am so excited !
jeff is gonna help me save the school .
not all by himself . i am learning excel .
jeff , do you know excel ?
no .
well , it looks like you do .
yay , teaching !
i , as you know , am dramatic professor sean garrity ,
and you are now embarking on an odyssey of discussion
about an actor who keeps the world asking :
nicolas cage , good or bad ?
yes , young man ?
so you don &apos;t know ?
mr. nadir .
mr. nadir drove our tv studies professor out of his mind
by proving that there was an answer
to the question &quot; who &apos;s the boss ? &quot;
angela .
i admire your brain , mr. nadir .
i did not admire professor sheffield ,
but i promise you , this question has no answer .
your homework is to watch five nicolas cage films by wednesday ,
no marathons .
space out your viewings .
five , that &apos;s it ?
be careful , abed nadir .
promise me you will be careful .
i have no idea how to make a curriculum .
becoming a teacher was a huge mistake .
without a doubt .
that said , there are certain perks .
excuse me .
i didn &apos;t know teachers could cut in line .
i can actually experience this food warm and disgusting .
winger , what are you doing ?
this line is for food , not for lionel richie tickets .
this is my house .
come here .
this man &apos;s name is mr. winger ,
and mr. winger is a teacher .
you know what that means ?
it means he gets your meatballs .
ah , please . that &apos;s all i have .
get outta here .
place is a zoo .
the trick is , you gotta show the other baboons
you got a bigger , redder ass .
let &apos;s hit the lounge .
everybody , this is the new guy , winger .
he &apos;s having trouble planning his curriculum .
what ?
here &apos;s all you need to know :
break into groups , grade each other &apos;s papers ,
and please enjoy the seven @-@ disc edition of planet earth .
is there a mr. winger in here ?
jeffrey , we need to carve out some time to learn excel .
do you guys know excel ? i &apos;m learning .
you know the rules , pelton .
drop the checks and move on .
oh . jeffrey ,
i &apos;m gonna boot up my computer and download the tutor ...
what was that about ?
union rules .
management &apos;s not allowed in the faculty lounge .
i could get used to this .
nicolas cage is so weird .
i mean , he seemed scared to smell that flower
but happy to get shot .
he &apos;s a complex performer .
he &apos;ll give you the rock , con air ,
then face off , and you think you understand ,
but then windtalkers ,
guarding tess , the wicker man .
he begs you to stop watching , but you can &apos;t .
that was an odd choice .
would you say it was odd good or odd bad ?
maybe he &apos;s just good in good movies
and then acts crazy in crap to make drug money .
but is he good , or is he bad ? every actor is something .
robert downey jr . , good , jim belushi , bad .
van damme , the good kind of bad ,
johnny depp , the bad kind of good .
there &apos;s a spectrum , and cage is on it .
i just have to find him .
i &apos;m gonna go check on jeff .
hello .
hey , jeff , how &apos;s the old curriculum going ?
great . consider our nation &apos;s youth pre @-@ inspired .
want a refill , winger ?
is that hickey ?
yeah .
we &apos;re working on syllabuses .
hey , let &apos;s turd some lockers !
gotta go ! teacher thing !
it &apos;s &quot; syllabi . &quot;
guterman . droppin &apos; mad science ?
ooh , elaine , take it easy on the oxford commas .
hey , walk , don &apos;t run , mister ! this isn &apos;t a racetrack !
okay , dangerous minds , let &apos;s break into groups ,
discuss chapter one , and if you are lucky ,
we might sneak in a little planet earth .
any questions ?
just a few .
ahh , she in your class , yo !
so i guess , just ...
read chapter one .
and memorize the federal rules of civil procedure .
class dismissed .
not so fast , jeff .
i assume you know why i &apos;m keeping you after class .
not really .
ski cap and white dave got lots of stuff wrong too .
you &apos;re the teacher , jeff .
you don &apos;t have to rub it in .
what i saw today was embarrassing .
you were late , you clearly had no idea ...
hey !
you had no idea what tort reform meant ,
and when i asked you to explain the sixth amendment ,
you pled the fifth !
i know my rights .
no , you don &apos;t . that &apos;s the problem .
here . i gathered some materials .
tomorrow morning , before class ,
i need to verify that you know enough to teach .
you &apos;re gonna quiz me ? you &apos;re the worst .
i wish troy was in my class instead of you !
i hate her , i hate her , i hate her , i hate her ,
i hate her , i hate her , i hate her , i hate her , i hate her .
hey , wait , i warned you to separate these worlds .
she &apos;s lead , we &apos;re chalk .
she needs to be taken out .
of your class . i say minus her .
minus her ?
give her a @-@ minuses .
it &apos;ll drive her nuts , she &apos;ll drop .
she &apos;ll call me on it . she &apos;ll report me .
teachers don &apos;t have to explain minuses .
why do you think we invented &apos; em ?
she &apos;s my friend .
eh .
you like the leonard meatballs ?
they added something special .
it &apos;s leonard .
come on , i &apos;m just messing with you .
you done with your bit ? i &apos;d like my earring back .
yeah ?
go get your earring , you piece of human garbage .
oh , my god .
okay , hey , i have a working theory ,
and don &apos;t react until you &apos;ve heard the whole thing .
if you watch closely , at the seven @-@ minute mark in snake eyes ,
you &apos;ll notice the moment where an alien arm could &apos;ve come up and ...
abed , this isn &apos;t worth it .
maybe nicolas cage is just ... crazy .
all actors are crazy , annie . some crazy actors are good ,
some are bad , but none of them are neither .
there &apos;s no such thing as both , so which one is ...
nicolas cage , huh ? oh ! oh !
okay , so break into groups ,
and then , you guys quiz each other .
mr. winger , is that really the best use of our time ?
seems like the value of having you here is ...
i think my value as a teacher is to teach you how to learn .
i think you &apos;re telling us we should teach ourselves .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna learn if i tell you how to think .
i think if you tell us what you think ,
then we &apos;ll learn that .
i thought you should break into groups ,
but you failed to learn that , so your theory &apos;s invalid .
ooh , snap .
break into groups .
mr. winger , how did you do that ?
do what ?
you won an argument against annie edison .
you don &apos;t argue with annie , garrett ,
you let her argue with herself until she loses .
you can win by not arguing ?
yeah , ski cap .
anyone that tries to argue has already lost ,
because they pick an argument to lose .
i mean , that &apos;s why i never lost a case .
prosecutors beat themselves , because they d ... here .
because they draw a circle
around something called &quot; the truth , &quot;
and they say that everything outside it is a lie .
annie .
don &apos;t cry , you were right .
i actually might enjoy teaching .
i &apos;m not crying because of you .
i got this from professor hickey .
what the hell ? he gave you a dead rat ?
no , this is my witness intimidation project .
he gave me this .
a @-@ minus .
i guess i overextended my schedule .
i &apos;m sorry , jeff . i have to drop your class .
okay , thoughts on nicolas cage .
i think he &apos;s a genius .
i mean , he keeps getting hired for some reason ,
and it &apos;s not because of his hair .
i don &apos;t know , if i was in 70 films over 30 years ,
and i spent each one talking at random volumes ,
i might accidentally win an oscar .
i think our opinions about pop culture are fed to us
by machines designed to criminalize human autonomy .
good one .
dear god .
abed .
no , stand back .
give him space .
nicolas cage , good or bad .
a challenge , certainly , but not unsolvable ,
because all actors have distinct values ,
which i use to find answers .
abed , how much nicolas cage did you ...
enough !
i watched enough to find ... the answers .
because this ... this is my reality ,
this is how i learned to be , and my being
doesn &apos;t allow for nicolas ...
freaking cage , okay ?
oh , yeah !
yeah ! oh ! oh !
oh , i &apos;m a cat . i &apos;m a sexy cat .
abed ?
think of something safe like
holly hunter , or don cheadle !
abed ? abed !
that was brilliant .
you gave annie a @-@ minus ?
how could you ? what were you thinking ?
are you drawing a peanut ?
it &apos;s a duck ,
and it &apos;s none of your concern , actually .
are you trying to cartoon ?
trying and succeeding . state your business .
i want to know what kind of monster
minuses the best student in his class .
i &apos;m a monster ?
i was in the storm drain lair of the black river ripper .
i have seen human heads used for things other than heads ,
so you best not be calling me a monster .
okay , you &apos;re a bad teacher .
i got her off your back .
i was handling it .
unlike you , i know how to engage my students .
i mean , i may not love teaching ,
but i did fool around with it today ,
and i may hook up with it again a few more times
even if i do dump it right before christmas .
we do not work for them .
maybe we do .
that does not count as an argument .
yeah , well , drawing ducks doesn &apos;t count as cartooning !
it &apos;s one duck , his name is jim ,
and publishers are interested !
miss edison , good news .
i talked to professor hickey and
it turns out your project was an &quot; a. &quot;
you used your connections to change my grade ?
no , an a @-@ minus means you actually earned an &quot; a , &quot;
but your teacher doesn &apos;t like you .
it &apos;s a secret faculty thing .
what ?
are you kidding ?
et tu , brute ?
am i using that right ?
i &apos;ve been busting my butt for five years ,
and the whole thing comes down
to a few old losers &apos; petty insecurities ?
oligarchy !
et tu , brute !
we &apos;ve got to tell people !
minuses are made up !
it &apos;s riot time ! yeah !
bring me their heads !
pop pop !
abed ? i couldn &apos;t find you at school , so i got worried .
you &apos;re throwing away all your little movies , why ?
they have no value anymore .
well , if you &apos;re looking for something to believe in ,
i know a skinny , little hebrew handyman you could meet .
i &apos;m not going to become christian , shirley ,
or a better muslim .
this was my religion .
i thought the meaning of people was somewhere in here .
then i looked inside nicolas cage
and i found a secret .
people are random and pointless .
well , in my religion ,
the whole point is that you can &apos;t understand every little thing ,
and you know , there &apos;s a word for people
who remind you that you &apos;re not god ,
and invite you to try a little harder .
prophets , messiahs , fung fu pandas .
so nicolas cage is jesus ?
uh , no ,
but he clearly works in mysterious ways ,
and maybe that &apos;s just his job .
and that &apos;s why critics can call him a genius or an idiot
and be right no matter what .
a demon to some and an angel to others ,
like a cenobite .
excuse me , did you say cenobite ?
yeah , you know , cenobite , like from hellraiser .
you like hellraiser ? you know the word &quot; hellraiser &quot; ?
i thought pinhead in space was a bit of a letdown ,
but i &apos;m in for the ride .
rise up , greendale !
your teachers have been lying to you !
you deserve slightly higher grades !
slightly higher grades ! slightly higher grades !
the whole world is watching this !
yeah !
oh , wait .
i &apos;m out of data minutes .
the whole world will be watching this on the first of next month !
slightly higher grades ! slightly higher grades !
jeffrey , do something !
slightly higher grades .
distract them . take your shirt off !
here .
slightly higher grades !
slightly higher grades !
everybody ,
calm down ! just listen !
do you think the students and teachers at harvard
are at each other &apos;s throats ?
no , because they &apos;re all rich .
we all have something in common too .
we all suck . we &apos;re all broke .
we all just went through an entire week
of meatball lunches without even blinking .
oh , that &apos;s on me .
i converted the lunch menu to a spreadsheet .
the teachers here are teachers here
because they did something wrong , same as the students .
so get on the same team , because , take it from me ,
those of us that get to leave aren &apos;t going anywhere .
boo !
no , you suck !
jeffrey , go with my &quot; take off your shirt &quot; plan !
may i point out that you &apos;re doing this together ?
it &apos;s all based on rows and columns of cells .
i think that &apos;s why the call it &quot; excel . &quot;
i don &apos;t care .
mm @-@ kay ,
now , i know it &apos;s unrealistic to think that
we can eliminate riots completely ,
but i have been crunching the numbers ,
and i believe we can reduce them by 40 % .
let &apos;s hope the man doesn &apos;t target you
for dreaming this big .
here &apos;s my plan .
you know that &quot; save greendale &quot; committee you pretended to form ?
we need one of those for real .
i want a student / teacher alliance , with you in charge .
i vote myself out .
you don &apos;t have a quorum .
and don &apos;t forget , if i fire you , you &apos;re likely starve and die ,
so you know .
do you want me to cut your meatball ?
all right , look , there are two things i don &apos;t do well ,
apologies and drawing duck bills .
i lost perspective .
students aren &apos;t the enemy ,
and , i don &apos;t know , maybe my bills are a little pointy .
maybe i &apos;m basing them on beaks .
apologize to annie .
i did , i gave her an &quot; a. &quot;
i don &apos;t know how else to make it right .
oh . i guess , i don &apos;t know , i quit .
i got a better idea .
as our first order of business
for the student / teacher save greendale committee ,
we hereby ban the dean from attending future meetings .
yeah .
our second order of business :
lunch .
yeah .
i &apos;m taste @-@ testing rations for the shelter i &apos;m digging .
are you the coolest person in the world ?
i doubt it .
i would like to address the fact that
there are no asian @-@ americans represented here .
we can get chang .
no need to rush into anything , i just wanted to address it .
anybody want some nuts ?
quiet , i think jeff &apos;s coming .
this is gonna be hilarious .
yeah , pharmacy please .
yeah , this is buzz hickey .
i think you gave me the wrong medication .
i usually get lipitor .
what do you mean my insurance won &apos;t cover it anymore ?
my body doesn &apos;t respond well to the generic stuff .
let me ask you a question , lady , can you pay out of pocket ?
i &apos;m an educator , ma &apos;am ,
living on a teacher &apos;s salary !
no , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s your name ?
leia , well , let me tell you something , leia ,
i wake up every night screaming .
life is unfair , but it &apos;s the only thing we g ...
yeah , yeah . yeah , i &apos;ll call back later .
mom , it &apos;s buzz . i &apos;m gonna say this as fast as i can .
