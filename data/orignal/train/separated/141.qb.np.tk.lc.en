第七季 第二十一集
it &apos;s a terrible thing
when someone loses their moral compass .
it starts with a small infraction ,
something insignificant .
then it &apos;s followed by two more infractions
because the first one has long been expected as justified .
then , like a pyramid scheme of moral laxity ,
the lies become misdemeanors ,
the misdemeanors become felonies ,
and the felonies become a way of life .
and that brings us to the defendant ,
governor peter florrick .
it also brings us to his enablers ,
his campaign manager , eli gold ,
and-- i &apos;m sorry to say--
his wife , alicia florrick .
now , mrs. florrick will be sitting behind her husband
every day in court .
in this way , the defense wants you to think warmly
of governor florrick .
huh , if his wife stands beside him ,
he can &apos;t be that bad .
well , i want you to resist that temptation ,
and i will give you a good reason .
alicia florrick is part of a criminal conspiracy ...
objection , your honor ,
mrs. florrick is not on trial .
i didn &apos;t say she was on trial ,
i said you were cynically using her presence ...
excuse me , you just accused her of criminal conspiracy .
if anyone is being cynical ...
excuse me , your honor , this is my opening argument
and the defense attorney will have her chance ...
what is cynical , sir , is to point to a wife
who has stood by her husband for years .
and if she were not here ,
you would point to that as suspicious .
your honor ...
no , i &apos;m gonna let you two burn yourselves out , okay ?
is there anything else ? are you done , ms. lockhart ?
i am , your honor .
as you know , i came late to this case .
as you pointedly keep reminding us
over and over and over . do you see this ?
‭ and do you see the hash mark that you have there ?
yes .
okay , every time
one of you provokes a round of crosstalk ,
you get a mark , and whoever has
the most at the end of the day will be held
in contempt and fined $ 10,000 .
now , isn &apos;t that fun ?
well , it is ... unusual .
okay .
good . let &apos;s continue .
he hates me .
he has for years .
i know .
this is not gonna be a cakewalk .
i got a call around 2 : 00 a.m.
that my son had been involved in a shooting .
i thought at first he was the one who &apos;d been shot ,
but they said he was the shooter .
and who was he accused of shooting ?
his girlfriend , patty tanniston .
and what did you do when you heard about this ?
i went to see peter florrick .
he was state &apos;s attorney at the time
and my friend .
you are a campaign donor of mr. florrick &apos;s , is that right ?
yes .
hmm . what did you ask him ?
i told him i didn &apos;t want my son going to jail .
i couldn &apos;t imagine he &apos;d done it , but
the evidence was against him .
and what did mr. florrick say ?
he said , &quot; lloyd ... &quot;
... &quot; you know how much i count on your support .
you have nothing to worry about . &quot;
and you took this to mean ?
exactly what it sounded like--
he was going to make the charges go away .
and what happened after that ?
well , two days into richie &apos;s trial ,
some evidence went missing .
bullets that were in the state crime lab .
the judge declared a mistrial .
what did she say ?
nothing .
she said nothing ?
what did you ask ?
how &apos;s the trial ?
did you piss her off ?
what ? is that so unlike you ?
she &apos;s in mrs. florrick mode for the trial .
that &apos;s all .
so you think he did it ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think alicia thinks he didn &apos;t ,
but if he goes to prison , that wouldn &apos;t be bad for you .
lucca .
what ?
can we give it a rest ?
okay .
i &apos;ll shut up , but i speak the truth .
do you want ... ? do you want ... ?
do you want us to leave ?
not if you don &apos;t mind the dust .
more expansions ?
it looks like it .
i never said that . didn &apos;t happen .
connor knows you won &apos;t
put peter on the stand , so there &apos;s no way to rebut .
okay , well , let &apos;s see what i can do , and , uh ,
peter and alicia ,
hold hands , be warm
towards each other . you &apos;re being watched .
the jury wants to see you close .
doing our best .
all right , recess is over .
counselors , do you have any questions ?
uh , yes , your honor .
mr. garber , you said you told
governor florrick , you couldn &apos;t imagine your son had done it ,
but the evidence was against him .
is that right ?
yes .
so , this conversation must have been about the evidence ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
well , you said the evidence was against him ,
your son , so you must have been discussing the evidence ?
oh . right .
good .
and the governor , your friend ,
was familiar with the evidence .
he had just reviewed it ?
yes .
so then , when governor florrick said ,
&quot; you have nothing to worry about , &quot;
doesn &apos;t it make more sense that
he meant &quot; i have reviewed the evidence ,
and you have nothing to worry about ? &quot;
but that &apos;s not what he said .
oh , it &apos;s not ? well ,
let me read again exactly what you said .
&quot; i couldn &apos;t imagine he &apos;d done it ,
but the evidence was against him . &quot;
and governor florrick , your friend ,
the friend you are now betraying ...
objection .
withdrawn . the governor responded after
reviewing the evidence , &quot; you have nothing to worry about . &quot;
sir , why can &apos;t the governor &apos;s comment , &quot; you have nothing
to worry about &quot; be interpreted as
the calming commiseration of a good friend ?
oh , i see you &apos;re looking at mr. fox .
should i ask him ?
objection .
yeah , sure . sustained ,
but it did look like he was checking with you for the answer .
should i ask again , mr. garber ?
no .
it wasn &apos;t the commiseration of a friend , and you know it , peter .
excuse me , don &apos;t talk to my client , sir ,
especially since you know he can &apos;t talk back .
and enjoy your deal with the ausa .
objection ! your honor .
yeah , i &apos;m way ahead of you .
two to one .
wait . no . how did i get one ?
correction . two to two .
eight years .
no .
okay . then what else do we have to discuss ?
nothing .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
your husband did it , mrs. florrick .
then prove it .
seriously .
i &apos;ve defended enough people
to know how shallow those words are .
i don &apos;t care what you believe .
i care what you can prove , so prove it .
i have a surprise witness , mrs. florrick .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
oh , not much .
i &apos;m being made into the evil woman here .
is that alicia ?
i need your help .
the ausa is holding at eight years .
he says he has a surprise witness .
can you find anything out ?
sure . you think it &apos;s cary ?
maybe .
i &apos;ll talk to canning .
but anything you can find out would be helpful .
i &apos;ll do my best .
how are you doing ?
me ? i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m exhausted .
where are you ? are you ... are you at a construction site ?
the conference room .
the wall is mostly down .
the wall ? what wall ?
the conference room wall .
not at lockhart / florrick .
it is a pure meritocracy-- where the women decide .
so come , talk to us , visit us , let us impress you .
excuse me . it &apos;s my partner .
hey . is everything all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
are we expanding ?
um , well , yes .
i &apos;m meeting right now with shannon janderman .
i think she &apos;s gonna jump ship .
well , don &apos;t you think
it would have been a good idea to let me know ?
well , what do you mean ? we did discuss this .
i have meetings all week . i can &apos;t cancel them
because of the trial .
no , no , no , the construction .
what construction ?
oh , my god !
how could the ... ?
where is david ?
how could he let this happen ?
* pestilential nuisances who write for autographs *
* all people who have flabby hands and irritating laughs ... *
they had the wrong floor .
law firm on the 18th is expanding .
oh , my god . what do we do ?
i called the insurance .
we &apos;re covered .
i have shannon janderman
coming over tomorrow to impress her .
well , we &apos;ll use the conference room
on the 27th floor .
uh , the paralegals are in there .
okay , we &apos;ll think of something .
diane , we have to get back to court .
there &apos;s another possibility .
what &apos;s that ?
we expand to the 29th floor .
what ?
we want to expand and hire more lawyers .
the 29th floor is empty .
that equity firm went bankrupt .
yes .
but we should expand because
we decide to expand , not because
someone accidentally destroyed our conference room .
why not ?
matan brody , assistant state &apos;s attorney in cook county .
you were the lead prosecutor in the richard locke case ?
with cary agos , that &apos;s correct .
would you say peter florrick micromanaged this case ?
i would .
and in what way did he do that ?
well , for one , he came to the crime scene .
he did ? on the night of the murder ?
yes .
is that unusual ?
i &apos;ve worked with four sa &apos;s in 11 years .
first time i &apos;d ever seen it .
so as the crime scene was being processed , peter was there ?
yes . he asked a lot of questions , he worried
about their methods , their experience , he had us review
911 calls earlier in the week .
and did this behavior continue ?
yes , through prep , right up until trial .
even the charging decision .
we could &apos;ve gone for first degree murder ,
but he barely let us go for second .
thank you , mr. brody .
the murder of ms. tanniston happened just two weeks
after governor florrick assumed office .
is that correct ?
yes , i believe so .
and this was governor florrick &apos;s second stint as state &apos;s attorney
after the corruption charges against him
had been thrown out ?
yes .
so , showing up at a crime scene ,
making sure evidence is collected properly--
couldn &apos;t that be the action of a re @-@ elected state &apos;s attorney
wanting to ensure the @-@ the highest standards ?
it could be , but it wasn &apos;t here .
i see .
how many gun felony charges were thrown out
under the previous state &apos;s attorney , glenn childs ?
i don &apos;t know .
625 .
that &apos;s over 12 % .
do you know how many were thrown out under peter florrick ?
mr. florrick was in office for fewer years .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re making your bias evident .
29 cases were thrown out , sir .
that &apos;s fewer than two percent .
so it seems that peter florrick &apos;s
micromanagement was needed .
it wasn &apos;t needed .
objection . argumentative .
our department had double the prosecutions
before peter florrick .
of course you had double the prosecutions
because you didn &apos;t care about the rule of law .
your honor , i &apos;m objecting here . this is not a debate .
that is such defense attorney crap .
alicia .
you &apos;re looking good .
thank you , so are you .
you staying out of trouble ?
trying .
you seem to be drawing a lot of interest .
it happens when your husband &apos;s on trial .
so , is cary testifying against peter ?
let me ask you a question ,
is peter scapegoating cary ?
no .
then no .
so we &apos;re linked ?
well , you don &apos;t go after cary ,
i have no reason to go after peter .
good .
then that &apos;s that .
not really .
you have a problem .
peter is guilty .
i have to get back to court , mr. canning .
thank you .
the ausa has proof .
they have a witness who &apos;s not on the list .
how do you know that ?
because she approached us . she wanted to know
what cary was gonna say .
she ? who &apos;s she ?
geneva pine .
if she testifies , peter goes to prison .
what can she say ?
everything .
what the hell ?
david , where have you been ?
when people come off the elevator ,
i want them to think of wings .
flight . eagles . soaring eagles .
what the freaking hell ?
workmen accidentally destroyed the conference room .
now we &apos;re thinking of leasing the 29th floor
and building a staircase to it .
not a staircase .
a stair presentation .
who &apos;s he ?
irv bircher . i designed your offices ,
now i want to bring them
into the 21st century .
this is the 21st century .
no , you &apos;re deluding yourself .
pale wood , glass .
this is an apple store , circa 2009 .
that is the 21st century .
jason .
i need to ask a favor .
well , actually not a favor .
i can pay .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , i @-@ i just mean ...
i don &apos;t know how this should work .
it &apos;s for peter .
yes .
just ask me a favor .
geneva pine .
canning says she &apos;s testifying ,
but she wasn &apos;t the prosecutor on the case ,
and we need to know what she knows .
and what to use against her .
yeah .
i &apos;m on it .
i &apos;m sorry .
i have to finish this with peter .
alicia , you don &apos;t have to apologize .
i can &apos;t get my head around what you said .
which part ?
the not wanting to get stuck ,
but wanting to be together .
i don &apos;t know how to reconcile those two .
i know .
i need time .
i &apos;m not someone who likes being untethered .
come back up with me .
i should get to work .
later ?
yeah .
so who do you want to know about ?
库克县助理检察官
i know all the dirt in the sa &apos;s office .
geneva pine .
what do you want to know ?
i need anything out of the ordinary ,
anything that i can use .
you want some turkey sandwich ?
no thanks , i ate .
so , here &apos;s the thing ,
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office is like a big ole family ,
with a mama , and a papa , and a whole lot of children .
who &apos;s the papa ?
peter florrick .
at the time .
and the mama ?
geneva pine .
that &apos;s why she had access to all the cases .
she was sleeping with him .
she was sleeping with peter florrick ?
yup .
long time affair . from what i hear ,
she was sleeping with him up to a month ago .
that &apos;s why she &apos;s testifying .
he broke it off with her .
can you use that ?
geneva pine .
i work in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
and you worked under peter florrick ?
yes .
and did you interrogate mr. locke
on the night of the shooting ?
i did .
can you tell me
about this interview ?
mr. locke was upset .
he kept saying he loved his girlfriend ,
that he wished things had happened differently .
differently ?
um , what @-@ what did he mean by that ?
it felt like he was about to confess .
did he have an attorney with him ?
no , he hadn &apos;t asked for one yet .
but he did later ?
yes .
after peter showed up
and interrupted mr. locke
and asked if i had mirandized him .
had you ?
no ,
because i wasn &apos;t questioning mr. locke .
is that standard practice ?
if we arrest someone , it &apos;s a custodial interrogation ,
and we read them their rights .
if we show up , and they want to tell us
about the crime they committed , we don &apos;t stop them .
but peter florrick made you .
he did ,
and then richard locke clammed up .
lawyered up .
tell me , um , what are these ?
the four bullets recovered from the crime scene .
these two were taken from the wall behind patty tanniston .
these two were recovered from her body .
i see , these were the ones that killed her .
yes .
and you helped supervise
the ballistic testing for these bullets .
was there a conclusion to this testing ?
yes , they were fired
from a glock 26 owned by mr. locke , the defendant .
that seems like pretty damning evidence .
why weren &apos;t they used at trial ?
they were used .
but before the defense had the chance to test the bullets ,
they were lost .
which caused the mistrial .
yes .
i thought we should conduct a top @-@ to @-@ bottom search
for the bullets .
and what did mr. florrick say ?
he said he would take it under advisement .
and did he ?
no .
nothing more at the moment , your honor .
counselor , i imagine you want your usual moment to consult .
yes , just one second , your honor .
sure , i &apos;m made of nothing but time .
我们需要谈谈
i &apos;m only doing this because our fates are tied .
doing what ?
helping .
as long as you keep cary out of it and don &apos;t point fingers ,
i got your back .
really ?
that i &apos;d like to see .
geneva pine is lying .
is that what those say ?
no , these just give the motive .
what &apos;s that ?
she was a spurned lover .
these are affidavits from coworkers saying
that peter florrick broke off an affair with her .
got it . good . thanks .
you heard what i just said ?
yes .
were you wanting me to cry , mr. canning ?
oh , my god .
i thought my husband
no longer cheated .
god , i love you .
i know .
she was a good witness .
the jury believed her .
i know , so how can we undercut her ?
i can argue that peter was being diligent ,
but that doesn &apos;t undercut the crime lab failure .
could you go after her reputation ?
i don &apos;t think she has an issue
with the disciplinary commission .
go to motive .
what do you mean ?
no one else heard peter reject the search of the crime lab .
only geneva .
you think she &apos;s lying ?
i think you can make a case she &apos;s lying .
how ?
she was sleeping with peter .
these are affidavits from coworkers
saying peter broke up with her .
and she &apos;s trying to get back at him .
goes to motive .
how did you get these ?
canning .
well , that was , uh ,
chief justice bennett .
he &apos;s going to look into her background
and see if we can use anything .
what ?
what are those ?
they are affidavits from geneva &apos;s coworkers
saying that she &apos;s lying
because you broke up with her after having a long affair .
what ?
they are affidavits from coworkers .
you have people saying that geneva and i had an affair ?
yes , and that she &apos;s lying because she wants to hurt you .
that &apos;s not true .
why don &apos;t we step out ?
no .
it &apos;s not true , we can &apos;t use them .
we &apos;ll just give you a minute .
just use it , peter .
no .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s in those affidavits ,
but there was nothing between geneva and me .
if you &apos;re worried about embarrassing me ...
i &apos;m not worried about anything , alicia .
when people think bad things of you ,
they keep thinking bad things .
what you have here
is office gossip .
who got it for you ?
your investigator ?
no .
well , i &apos;m not gonna use it .
be careful , this one &apos;s got a ...
it &apos;s got a little bit of a kick to it .
god , i look good with a gun .
what do you need ?
uh , something that &apos;s difficult for you .
i need you on the stand .
florrick trial ?
yeah , i read your ballistics report .
it &apos;s deliberately impenetrable .
i needed another test ,
but they lost the bullets before i could .
yes , but to withhold an opinion ,
you have to have an opinion .
opinions are nothing without science behind it .
no , you &apos;re an expert witness .
if your opinion rises out of your expertise ,
that &apos;s something .
you don &apos;t usually play this game .
i know . my client &apos;s being railroaded .
he &apos;s not being &quot; railroaded . &quot;
he &apos;s a democratic governor
being judged by a democratic jury .
that &apos;s as far from &quot; railroaded &quot; as you can get .
i &apos;m not asking you to lie .
i &apos;m just ...
asking you to give your preliminary opinion .
in a manner that is helpful to my defense .
please , kurt .
help me ?
you were the ballistics expert hired by the sa &apos;s office
to assess these bullets ?
that is correct .
now , i should get something out of the way ,
right up front .
i &apos;m questioning because you
are related to a lawyer on our defense team .
yes , i &apos;m married to diane lockhart .
congratulations .
thank you , your honor .
but this marriage happened after
the ballistics testing you did for the sa &apos;s office ?
yes . did you give governor florrick
a preliminary report on these bullets
before they disappeared ?
objection !
your honor , this trial has nothing to do
with locke &apos;s guilt .
this is about peter florrick .
yes , and we are offering
mr. mcveigh &apos;s testimony
to show governor florrick &apos;s state of mind .
his state of mind is irrelevant here .
it @-@ it &apos;s his action ...
governor florrick had no reason to lose these bullets
if he thought they proved locke &apos;s innocence .
in fact , it would be against his interest ...
your honor , this is circular ...
i &apos;ll allow .
he likes her .
mr. mcveigh ?
as a respected ballistics expert ,
who has worked for the sa &apos;s office for ten years--
what was your determination about these bullets ?
well , i should say that my findings were preliminary .
but from what i saw ,
these bullets did not come from mr. locke &apos;s gun .
pardon our dust .
pardon our noise .
yeah , the world has changed .
people don &apos;t look
for the same thing in a law firm .
they look for a personality .
which is what we want to supply--
an all @-@ service firm
with a female perspective .
diane , sorry to interrupt .
uh , the coleman divorce , the bitch is on the line .
she wants to talk to both of us .
david , what is your problem ?
my problem ?
yes , there is no coleman divorce .
my problem is i &apos;m an equity partner .
you &apos;re spending my money .
no , i &apos;m spending our money .
there was a vote .
a vote in a dictatorship is not a vote .
it was a fair vote .
with women outnumbering men .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so sorry , david .
the women outnumber the men .
that must be so hard for you .
it &apos;s not only hard , it &apos;s discriminatory .
oh , come on , you know what we were doing .
you &apos;ve been on a hiring binge ,
and how many men have you interviewed ?
how many male lawyers have you met with ?
i have met with men .
watch it , diane .
there &apos;s a discriminatory suit in your future .
this is an affidavit from a coworker of geneva pine .
he says that geneva often
bullied her way into other cases .
that &apos;s it ? nothing else ?
nope .
just time and dates
and she had some issues with back taxes .
nothing about her sleeping with peter ?
nothing i could confirm independently .
did you try to confirm it independently ?
i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m in a awkward position here .
i know .
and i think i &apos;m done .
what does that mean ?
i can &apos;t be doing this for your husband anymore .
investigating .
we &apos;ll talk after the trial .
okay .
you &apos;re a student of mr. mcveigh &apos;s ?
yes , for four years .
and you were asked to review mr. mcveigh &apos;s work in his case ?
yes .
diane ?
who is she ?
kurt &apos;s favorite .
whatever that means .
and what did you find ?
well , it was quite preliminary .
mr. mcveigh has only conducted
one chemical analysis on the bullets .
and as kurt said , before he could make
a more thorough examination ,
the bullets went missing .
did you find any deficiency in his analysis ?
objection-- calls for speculation .
your honor , as the defense pointed out ,
this is not about whether locke is innocent or guilty .
this is about peter &apos;s state of mind .
and therefore , mr. mcveigh &apos;s work
and how it was presented
to peter has a great bearing on this trial .
but mr. mcveigh had actual access to the bullets .
ms. westfall does not ...
oh , come on , you do not get to benefit
from your client &apos;s destruction of evidence !
objection-- that mischaracterizes the testimony here .
‭ okay . you both get a hash mark .
overruled , ms. lockhart .
you can &apos;t have it both ways !
thank you , your honor .
uh , do you need me to repeat the question ?
no , i &apos;m good .
i don &apos;t find any deficiencies
in mr. mcveigh &apos;s analysis of the bullets .
i do find that he , um--
how shall i say this--
oversold
his results in court .
uh , it is very easy to get a false negative
in gas chromatography ,
and i think he may have downplayed that here .
are you suggesting
that mr. mcveigh is lying here , ms. westfall ?
no , kurt is one of the most honest people i know .
i ...
i do think he had reason to spin his results .
i think that &apos;s fair ,
given the make @-@ up of the defense team .
nothing further , your honor .
ms. westfall , even if what you say is true--
mr. mcveigh oversold his conclusions here--
there &apos;s no reason to believe that
he didn &apos;t equally oversell them to governor florrick ?
well , i can &apos;t speak to that .
all i can say is that kurt always tells the truth .
but this isn &apos;t about mr. mcveigh .
this is about governor florrick &apos;s state of mind .
and if governor florrick heard the same thing from mr. mcveigh
that we heard here ,
he would have no reason to destroy those bullets .
i guess that &apos;s true .
one last question .
when you &apos;ve worked for the sa &apos;s office ,
did the state &apos;s attorney ever handle evidence ?
evidence like these bullets ?
no , never , it was always the prosecutor .
so matan ?
no ,
the co @-@ prosecutor handled the evidence , uh ...
cary agos .
we didn &apos;t do that .
we did not point the finger at cary .
and who did ?
it was your lawyer .
tell cary we &apos;re on the same side .
well , we were ...
until about ten minutes ago .
mr. agos , did you ever discuss with governor florrick
the ballistics results in the locke case ?
yes , i did .
and what was the nature of that discussion ?
that the bullets connected locke to the crime
and the murder weapon .
mr. mcveigh suggested here that
he was cautious in his analysis about the bullets .
yes , he was .
but that &apos;s his way .
we knew the bullets damned peter .
you @-@ you mean locke ?
yes , my apologies-- locke .
mr. agos ?
do you hate the florricks ?
no .
but don &apos;t you have reason to be angry with the florricks ?
yes .
yes .
you do .
so then why should this court take your testimony seriously ?
because i &apos;m telling the truth .
as you see it ?
yes , of course .
that &apos;s all i have to offer here .
the truth as i see it .
you didn &apos;t have to do that , cary .
i never meant you any harm .
you know , it &apos;s amazing , alicia .
after all these years working together ,
you still think i would come in here into a court of law
and perjure myself to hurt you .
i was here to tell the truth .
what are you here to do ?
i need to take the stand .
they want to hear from me .
they need to hear from me .
because i seem like a coward .
you don &apos;t . you seem smart .
the prosecution could rip you apart on cross .
i think the jury &apos;s against me .
what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re right .
i need to testify .
diane ?
i don &apos;t know .
we should prep .
see how you do .
you look grumpy .
nope .
this is my happy face .
peter &apos;s in trouble .
i think he might go to prison .
you don &apos;t sound that upset about it .
he &apos;s your client .
hey , i &apos;m trying my best .
but the facts just aren &apos;t cooperating .
how &apos;s alicia ?
a rock .
but if he goes to prison ,
she &apos;ll need a lot of comforting .
here &apos;s what you don &apos;t understand about alicia .
he goes to prison ?
she &apos;ll never divorce him .
ever .
i disagree .
because you think things are logical .
she will visit him every week in prison .
she will slowly drift away from me .
and she will be the stoic spouse .
and if he doesn &apos;t go to prison ?
she &apos;ll divorce him .
and which do you want ?
because
here &apos;s something you don &apos;t seem to understand about yourself .
you may play the game of being this hard @-@ bitten--
or is it hard @-@ boiled ?
one of the hards .
when you , in fact ,
have fallen in love .
tell me it &apos;s not true .
and i &apos;ll leave you here drinking .
all by your lonesome .
it &apos;s not true .
i don &apos;t believe you .
and take my advice .
stop playing it cool .
you want her ?
go to her and say ,
&quot; i want you .
&quot; and i &apos;ll protect you .
&quot; you don &apos;t owe your husband anything .
&quot; be happy .
&quot; come to me .
make me happy . &quot;
kurt ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i will make you happy every day of your life ,
but please forgive me .
please .
lloyd garber donated $ 5,000
to your pac in 2009 , is that correct ?
that &apos;s correct .
but in 2013,
a year after richard locke &apos;s mistrial ,
lloyd garber &apos;s donations quadrupled .
can you explain ?
i cannot .
lloyd garber and i never discussed money .
there was no tit for tat ?
&quot; you get my son off for murder
and i &apos;ll increase my financial support &quot; ?
i @-@ i believe i already answered that question .
no . too belligerent .
you &apos;re the governor .
be dignified .
he &apos;s going to ask it ,
and he &apos;s going to ask it more than once .
there was no tit for tat .
there were never any strings or conditions
attached to lloyd garber &apos;s , or anyone else &apos;s , contributions .
as a man who was convicted
of using state funds to pay for prostitutes ,
why should we take your word for anything ?
my attorney would object to that .
and judge cuesta overrules .
my conviction was overturned
and i was fully exonerated .
so are you saying that you never paid for prostitutes ?
never cheated on your wife ?
haven &apos;t broken every promise you &apos;ve ever made ?
it goes to character .
to your trustworthiness .
i believe i &apos;ve been up front about this .
i did pay for prostitutes , i did cheat on my wife ,
and i have worked every day
to make up for those indiscretions .
so would you agree ...
i &apos;m not finished .
and that is one of the reasons why ,
when i was voted back into office ,
i spent every day trying to make sure
there was not a single bad conviction .
because i saw what bad convictions did to families ,
did to me ,
did to my wife .
and i swore that i would never
let that ever happen again .
is that true ?
yes , counselor , that is true .
it &apos;s also true that i micromanaged this case .
guilty .
but that &apos;s what you should want
from a state &apos;s attorney .
someone who won &apos;t accept excuses
for a failure to mirandize
or allow for bad evidence collection .
someone who loses bullets ?
that was just a mistake .
you say that you have worked
hard every day to make up for
the indiscretions of the past ...
but we have evidence
that you were having a longtime affair
with not only a fellow prosecutor ...
we would object here .
yes , and judge cuesta doesn &apos;t like you . he would allow .
at what point are we playing husband and wife here ,
and at what point lawyers ?
all points .
because here &apos;s the thing :
you get up on that stand ,
and every past indiscretion
will be determined admissible .
your sleeping with geneva pine .
i didn &apos;t sleep
with geneva ...
your sleeping with marilyn garbanza .
i didn &apos;t sleep with ...
your sleeping with ramona lytton .
and you sleeping with will gardner
and you sleeping with your investigator !
i &apos;m not on trial , buddy .
are you saying you didn &apos;t sleep with geneva pine ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m saying .
and these prostitutes , you never slept with any of them , either ?
i believe i &apos;ve already admitted to that .
oh , well , good , good ,
at least you admitted to that .
that makes it okay , then .
objection .
what i don &apos;t understand is what this has to do
with my performance as the state &apos;s attorney .
because your performance is directly connected
to your actions before and after .
you said yourself you learned from your mistakes ,
that &apos;s why you were such a diligent s.a.
objection , your honor . where is the question ?
here it is .
you have lied so much , mr. florrick ,
why should any of us ever believe you again ?
because i went to prison .
because i was wrongly convicted .
i didn &apos;t ask for a speech ...
you asked a question .
i &apos;m answering it .
am i a flawed individual ?
yes .
have i done things in my personal life that i regret ?
yes , deeply .
but i never wanted anyone
to go through what i went through
and that is why i was a hard @-@ ass state &apos;s attorney .
that &apos;s why i threw out bad confessions .
that &apos;s why i micromanaged .
but that &apos;s when i was at my best .
that &apos;s when i was most honorable .
the 12 of you should give fair
and equal consideration to all the evidence
and deliberate with the goal of reaching an agreement .
your sole interest
is to determine whether the government
has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt .
good luck .
now , the stairs will start here
and expand out as they get higher ,
connecting to the north side of the 29th floor ...
and it will be all woman ,
from the north to the south .
david , just go back to your office .
i will , as soon as you sign this eeoc complaint .
oh , come on , david .
what ? i have just as much right to complain as any minority .
ms. lockhart ?
yes .
i &apos;m greg cady from the department of buildings .
i &apos;m here for a certificate of occupancy inspection .
and we &apos;ve run into an issue of compliance .
meaning ?
meaning somebody on your demolition crew
took out the load @-@ bearing wall for the 29th floor .
they did ?
yes .
does that mean our new floor could come
crashing down on our heads ?
yes .
you &apos;re kidding .
no , unfortunately .
you &apos;ll have to evacuate to the 27th floor .
uh ... when ?
now .
two years .
i came down from eight . i &apos;m not going lower .
i &apos;d rather see what the jury does .
and you know the jury
will probably do a lot more .
i &apos;ll ask him .
if i were you , i &apos;d do a lot more than ask .
take it to him .
and sell it .
before the jury comes back .
we &apos;re not giving up .
we &apos;re working different angles .
mike tascioni found a criminal case
against an s.a. in dupage county
in &apos; 98 that was thrown out .
he thinks we can mine it for a precedent .
eli , can you give us a minute ?
yes , of course . i &apos;m so sorry .
can i make a confession to you ?
sure .
i never liked wine .
i only drank it &apos; cause you liked it .
i was always a scotch guy .
i guess i inherited that from my father .
well , i can fix you a scotch .
no .
it &apos;s grown on me .
two years .
oh , god ...
i was in there for only eight months
and almost died .
wait for the verdict , peter .
i do that ,
i may actually die in prison .
ten years .
what did you think of the jury ?
i think they were judging us .
but i think your speech at the end went over well .
i was always good with a speech .
there &apos;s no good answer , is there ?
i don &apos;t know what to say .
i &apos;m not good at gambling .
don &apos;t decide yet , peter .
the jury &apos;s retired .
just ... sleep on it .
i &apos;m gonna take the deal .
it &apos;s the smart thing to do .
two years .
i &apos;ll get out ,
write a book , start over .
are you gonna come visit me ?
i will .
the hardest thing is being forgotten .
i won &apos;t forget .
okay .
what ?
the jury &apos;s back .
