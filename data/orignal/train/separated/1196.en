I'm sorry, I have to go.
What happened?
He left me.
Someone at a sanitarium you own
paid detective Wilden to alter his report.
You could do a lot of damage with that.
Could shut the whole place down.
Close Radley?
Did you miss me?
You still love him.
Whether I do or I don't,
I'm just trying to figure things out with Jake.
Okay, so let me help you.
You like Jake. You love Ezra.
"A" Was here?
Guys... Ali's book is gone.
Gotta you something. You drove all that way, so...
Can't I just be a nice guy?
"Looks like I'm winning."
"Thanks for the tip."
The journal. We gave Ali to "A."
"Whoever finds her gets to keep her."
Come on.
The tech said the Busy Bee Inn.
Can't this thing go any faster?
It's hard to see out here. There's no lights on this road.
The GPS says it's a mile straight ahead.
If "A" has been at the inn since he sent that text,
aren't we gonna be too late to help Ali?
Well, we won't know that until we get there.
That's if Ali's even there.
We're going off something she wrote in a journal two years ago.
There it is. Turn right.
What the hell happened here?
Looks like there was some kind of struggle.
I could definitely see Ali wearing this.
If Ali was here, where did she go?
Maybe she fought "A" off and got away.
Yeah, or he took her somewhere else.
Or worse.
第四季 第十六集
The worst part is not knowing what happened to her.
It's like deja vu all over again.
Just the thought of her in that room makes my skin crawl.
I don't think she was staying there. At least not last night.
How could you say that? You saw the room.
The broken window. The message on the door.
Yeah, exactly. Everything was a little bit too neat.
So what? You think "A" orchestrated that all
just to scare us?
Where are you? I can barely hear you.
The church. My mom wanted me to drop off
a pie for the bake sale.
Just call me later, okay?
Okay.
Dad.
How did you know I'd be here?
I didn't.
I came to see Toby.
I thought you said you were staying at Hanna's last night.
I changed my mind.
Get dressed. You're leaving.
Sure.
Right after you call mom and explain to her
what's going on between you and Mrs. Dilaurentis.
Or should I?
Jason fell off the wagon.
What?
Jessica and I have been helping him get into rehab.
Okay. But why all the secrecy?
It's not like this hasn't happened before.
He was arrested for starting a fight in a bar.
He didn't want us to tell anyone.
We were respecting his wishes.
And that's why Jessica wanted to wait
to tell him about the divorce.
They told us any upsetting news could cause a relapse. So...
But why are you working so hard
to keep this a secret from mom?
Spencer, if I never mentioned Jessica or Jason's name again,
it would be too soon for your mother.
See, I'm not lying to her,
I'm just not sharing everything.
There's a difference.
Hey, Spence, I got the hot water working.
Put some pants on. We need to talk about Radley.
Alone.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Yeah, Hanna had a rough night.
Oh, I thought she was doing better.
She's up and down.
I was hoping we could spend the morning together.
I wish I could, but I'm heading to Philly in a moment
to meet a college buddy.
Hardy?
No, no. Um, Curtis. The lacrosse guy I told you about.
We could do dinner. We could meet at the cabin.
Ah, I just don't think that I should go that far.
In case Hanna needs me or something.
等不及今天见你了
Jake's back from his tournament?
Yeah, he got in from Harrisburg last night.
Morning with me. Afternoon with him.
No, it's not like that.
I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
And I put you in this position.
So, you take your time and decide--
I've made up my mind.
I'm gonna talk to him today.
You are?
Yes.
You're the one. You always have been.
You're really giving away all these clothes?
That's like half of your wardrobe.
I'm just sick of the same old things.
You bought that dress last month. It looks beautiful on you.
Well, if you like it so much, you can have it.
You seemed really upset last night.
Do wanna talk about it?
Spence, the last thing I wanna do is discuss
my feelings over a tub of Chunky Monkey.
Okay, that's your favorite skirt.
No. It was Caleb's favorite.
Look, if you need more time to process--
Spencer, what is there to process?
He moved on. So ,I'm moving on, too.
Hanna? They're moving everything
out of the basement while they fix that pipe.
What in the world is happening in here?
You've never seen anyone clean out their closet before?
Not in this house.
Look, maybe you shouldn't be in such a rush
to get rid of all these things.
Where you going?
I need more bags.
Hello?
Anyone there?
Shana? Are you following me?
I have a message for you.
A message? From who?
Alison.
Alison's dead.
Isn't that what you told Spencer at the hospital?
We both know that's not true.
She wants you guys to stop looking for her.
It's too dangerous.
You almost got her killed at the inn last night.
Why would I believe anything you have to say?
You didn't know Alison.
Listen, Emily...
I've known her since I was three.
I grew up next door to her grandparents in Georgia.
If you knew Alison, you wouldn't be friends with Jenna.
Alison asked me to come to Rosewood to help figure out
who tried to kill her. Jenna's on the list.
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.
If you really are talking to her...
Prove it.
Radley's offering my family a settlement?
They're not admitting any negligence on their part,
but the accident did happen on their premises,
so they want to give you and your family something for your loss.
Well, what happened to us trying to shut down the place?
I still want to. But after looking into it,
I just don't think there's enough evidence
to substantiate a lawsuit.
We know Wilden altered the file.
Yes, but he's dead.
There's nobody else willing to testify against Radley.
Look, Toby, I know this isn't what you wanted to hear,
but at least you finally
know the truth about what happened to your mom.
I spoke with your father.
He's open to signing the agreement.
But in order to move forward, you need to sign, too.
I know it's not going to bring your mother back
or change the past,
but it can help your future.
Hey there, beautiful.
Oh, my God. What happened?
It's nothing.
Nothing?
You got a huge gash above your eye.
Well, comes with the territory.
Besides, you should've seen the other guy.
I missed you.
Yeah. I missed you, too.
You know, you should look into getting a new one of these.
Well, I've had it since I was fifteen.
I practice with it before all my big meets.
Kind of a superstitious thing.
Brought me good luck again.
I qualified for nationals.
Wow. Congratulations. That's amazing.
I'm not really surprised.
Thanks.
So you hungry? You wanna grab something to eat?
Sure.
Okay.
Actually, no.
You're not hungry?
I just-- I need to talk to you about something.
Sounds serious.
Kinda is.
While you were away, I...
I was just doing some thinking and--
You're back with Ezra.
Aren't you?
Why do you say that?
You told me the kid wasn't his.
You've been distant on the phone.
Come on, Aria. I can handle the truth.
I'm sorry, Jake.
I don't get it. I thought things were going so well between us.
Well, they were.
I love spending time with you.
Just...
Not as much as with him.
Ezra and I have a long history together.
I hope we can still be friends.
I'm gonna need a little time for that.
There's a gag clause in this.
If you sign this, you're agreeing to never talk about
What happened to your mother at Radley.
Not to the police, not the press. No one.
I know.
And if you do,
You're going to have to give back all this money
plus a huge penalty.
It doesn't matter. Your dad made it clear
we don't have a case.
Yeah, a little too clear.
What do you mean?
One minute he wants to shut down Radley,
And the next he wants to shut down you.
My mom fell, Spencer.
It was an accident.
How do we know that for sure?
We still don't know
why she was up there unsupervised,
Or who this "Fragile" Patient was with her.
Your dad also said that if we went to court,
Stuff about my mom's past would be dug up.
It could get ugly.
Look, Toby, I'm not saying that you shouldn't sign this.
But you have to make sure you
have all the information you need before you do.
I told Shana to find out what Ali had said to me
when she pulled me out of the barn.
When we were looking for Dr. Sullivan?
What did Ali say to you?
Uh, that's something I want to keep just between us.
Well, Shana's obviously lying.
I mean, Ali never mentioned her name once.
There were a lot of people in Ali's life we didn't know about.
Wait, Shana knew Paige first?
So what are we saying, that Paige is on Ali's list, too?
I don't know. Maybe.
Even if they were friends,
why would Ali trust Shana more than us?
We were her best friends.
Are you forgetting?
Someone's been tormenting us for years.
Making our lives miserable, one text at a time.
I think Shana's who we always thought she was:
One of "A's" minions.
And if "A" wants us to stop looking for Ali,
then that must mean Ali wasn't hurt last night.
So, "A" wants us to believe Shana's story so we stop looking
for Ali and he can find her.
Come on, Em.
You don't seriously believe that Shana moved all the way up
from Georgia so she could hunt down the person who tried
to kill her childhood friend, do you?
Ali could make someone love her enough to do that.
Hey.
Hi.
I figured you'd want this back.
Thank you.
What happened in here?
Oh, a water pipe burst in the basement.
So this is where everything's kind of living here for now.
This is a nice pool table.
We used to have one like it in my house.
Yeah, my dad left it here.
I never really played much, though.
So, I was... I was gonna call you today.
Check in, see how you're doing.
Oh, I'm good. Yeah, I'm really good.
Um, do you have to be somewhere?
Or can you stick around to play a game or two?
Yeah. Sure, why not?
Do you wanna rack them or should I?
You got it.
Ali said she missed you the most.
You were her favorite.
Nobody loved her as much as you.
She gave you a choice. To stay or to go with her.
Before she left, she kissed you.
Where is she? Where is Ali?
I never know.
She's always on the move. She finds me.
How long have you known that she's alive?
Since Mona went to Radley.
You've known this whole time?
Why did she... she come to you?
She wants to meet you, Emily. Tonight.
But you have to go alone.
That's the only way it'll be safe.
Why me?
I guess you really were her favorite.
That's not the ball you wanna try and sink.
You're stripes, remember?
Well, I was just giving you a head start.
I'm surprised you're in such a good mood.
I was worried about you last night.
No, I just had to get it out of my system.
You know you don't have to put up a front with me.
Are you gonna let me hit my stripes or not?
God, what am I doing wrong?
Here. Let me show you.
First of all, you're holding your stick way too low.
Once you get the angle that you want...
you just, um,
you just take the shot.
Wow. See? Not bad.
Watch out, Travis. I'm coming for you.
Shana knew the conversation we had outside the barn.
Word for word.
Well, "A" has a way of
knowing things that seem impossible to know.
I looked into it and her story checks out.
Shana did grow up next door to Ali's grandparents.
That doesn't mean she's in contact with her now.
Look, I took pictures of some of the stories
in Ali's journal before "A" got it.
And there are descriptions
of other places that she could be hiding.
We can keep looking.
Ali wants to meet me tonight.
Like she wanted to meet you at the kissing rock yesterday?
She needs our help, Spence.
Did Shana tell you this?
Look, even if this were true,
Why would Ali only want to meet with you?
I don't know.
Maybe "A" can't watch all of us all the time.
Look, I know you wanna
believe that this is Alison reaching out to you,
But it's not Ali, okay? This is "A."
I don't think so. Not this time.
Just because Shana knows
about this one conversation you and Ali had?
Yes.
Well, you're not going alone.
That's the only way she'll meet me.
Spencer, I told you because I didn't want to lie to you.
Okay? Don't make me sorry that I did.
Somebody's getting the royal treatment.
Well, your mom will be home soon.
I wanted to do something special for her.
I would have just gone for jewelry instead of roasted duck.
But that's just me.
I'm hoping you'll join us.
I think we all could use a nice family night together.
Toby told me about the settlement, dad.
Yeah, it's a decent amount of money.
It's not money that he's after.
A couple of days ago
he was ready to settle for a letter of apology.
Mushroom puff?
No, thanks. I try to stay away from fungus.
It's not like you to back away from a case this quickly.
I just did what's best for Toby's family.
Did you?
Why don't you let me deal with my clients,
and you worry just about yourself.
Now make yourself useful while I'm showering
and pick out some music for dinner.
And please, make it something happy, upbeat.
I don't like it, but I don't understand
how you can make such a colossal mistake.
Do you understand?
Do you see how this is-- this is difficult?
No, look at me! Look at me when I'm talking to you.
This doesn't make sense.
You have really screwed up.
You have really screwed up!
Oh, yes, please! Please drive away!
This isn't over!
Five in a row.
Wow, you're really kicking my ass.
Well, it's easy to win when someone lets you.
All right, it's getting late.
I should probably take off.
Yeah. Well, this was fun.
We should do it again soon.
Rematch anytime.
Sorry. Sorry, that was so stupid.
Of course you're not into me like that.
No, look... it's not that.
Then what?
You're just getting out of a relationship.
No, I'm not just getting out.
I'm completely out. It's done.
Maybe we should give this a little more time.
Mom. I thought you were going out after work with Ted.
He had to cancel. Hello, travis.
Hi, Mrs. Marin.
Can I speak to you for a second, please?
What?
I thought you and Travis were just friends.
We are.
You kiss all your friends like that?
Don't judge me.
I'm not judging, I'm concerned.
Uh, sorry to interrupt... but I really should get going.
Good idea.
No, Travis, stay here.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Travis, you have a little...
Yeah.
Okay, are you serious? You basically just kicked him out.
You will thank me later.
Trust me, throwing yourself at a new guy
is not the way to get over the old one.
You're one to throw stones.
Okay. I know that you're hurting right now,
but if you could take a step back,
you'd see I'm just trying to help--
I'm sick of everyone telling me what they think I should
and shouldn't do to get over Caleb.
It's my broken heart!
What the hell are you doing?
Jessica Dilaurentis is on the board at Radley?
Is this why you're pushing Toby to sign this agreement?
Jessica being on the board
has nothing to do with the facts of the case.
Did she tell you that Toby's mother's death was an accident?
Or was that your brilliant idea?
Spencer...
I'm going to the airport to pick up your mom.
If you're gonna continue to act like this,
I suggest you find another place to eat dinner.
Is Jason even in rehab?
Or did you make that up, too?
Toby, listen.
Whatever you do, do not sign that agreement.
Okay? I'll explain it to you later. Just don't.
Put your coat on. We're going out.
It was so thoughtful of you.
Keep it.
I can't do that.
What am I gonna do with it?
I don't have another Aria in my life.
Okay, well...
Thank you.
All right, I'll let you get back to your jump roping.
You know, I do care about you.
Which is why it's hard for me to understand
why you wanna be with a guy like Ezra.
What do you mean by that?
Nothing.
No, you were just about to tell me something. What?
Jake?
I saw him totally go off on a woman outside the Grille today.
What woman?
Some blonde. He was screaming at her
and pounding on her car.
That couldn't have been Ezra.
He's been in Philly all day.
You sure about that?
I always wondered if Ezra was the person you were afraid of.
I'm not afraid of Ezra.
Well, maybe you should be.
Look...
The Ezra I know doesn't have a mean bone in his body.
You do know him best.
Just do yourself a favor: keep your eyes open.
When your dad left me for Isabelle,
I was devastated. And furious.
I was lashing out at all the wrong people.
And a friend of mine suggested that I come here.
To throw plates against a wall?
You'd be surprised how good it feels.
'Kay? Come on.
Give it a try.
I don't see how this will change the fact that Caleb's gone.
It won't.
But it might help you get past the anger.
And once you do, I promise
you'll start to look at things differently.
Okay?
What do you have to lose?
See?
I wish I could come home to this every night.
So you have fun with Curtis?
Yeah, it was great catching up with him.
You know, I'm starving. Do you want like pizza or something?
Yeah, pizza sounds good.
Great.
Did you come in on the last train?
Yeah, I just made it.
Uh, I'm gonna wash up.
Jake saw you today.
Saw me where?
Outside the Grille.
Said that you were talking to some woman.
Actually, he used the word screaming.
Did you even go to Philadelphia?
No.
Who's the woman, Ezra?
Maggie's lawyer.
Maggie's lawyer?
Why were you meeting with her?
Maggie is trying to prevent me from seeing Malcolm.
I didn't know that you wanted that.
Just because he's not my son,
doesn't mean I don't care about him.
So, that's what you were doing all day?
You were meeting with her lawyer?
Her lawyer. My lawyer.
The whole thing is very complicated.
But why would you keep that from me?
Because having them in my life destroyed us once.
And we're just getting our footing back.
I didn't want to take the chance that that would upset you.
Okay, that doesn't explain your violent outburst.
I mean, Jake said that you really scared this woman.
The conversation was heated.
Voices were raised.
There was nothing violent about it.
So, either Jake misinterpreted what he saw,
or he's trying to make me look bad
so you'll rethink your decision.
Ezra, I really want this to work.
But it's only going to if we're honest with each other.
I made a mistake.
I really am sorry.
Look, I chose you knowing all that comes with it.
It's a choice I'm really happy that I made.
You're not coming in?
It's really you.
Yeah, I've missed you so much.
You have no idea how hard it's been to stay away.
Then don't anymore.
Let me help you.
We can go to the police. Or your parents.
I wish I could. I just don't know who I can trust.
You can trust me. Spencer, Aria--
I know I can trust you, Em.
I'm just not sure about them.
Why?
You never stopped caring about me, did you?
Even after everything I put you through.
You don't know how much I regret hurting you.
If I could do it all over again, things would be so different.
Who's doing this to you? Tell me who you're hiding from.
I thought I knew. But I was wrong.
That's why I need you, Em.
Help me find "A" so I can come home.
So that's who you think tried to kill you?
What was that?
Who's out there?
Did you tell anyone about this?
Ali, wait!
Ali! Please! Open up, Ali!
Ali, open up, please!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please Ali, I just want to talk.
I don't understand. How could she just disappear like that?
She didn't disappear. You scared her away.
I can't believe you followed me here.
I thought you were putting yourself in danger.
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.
I know. I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to work harder than that.
I betrayed Alison.
She's never gonna reach out to me again.
She's still playing games with us.
What are you talking about?
Ali sucked you back in.
She knew you were pulling away and that's why she picked you.
She wanted to make you feel special
so that you wouldn't give up on her.
That's sick.
No. It's brilliant.
It wasn't like that, okay? She was different tonight.
She was sincere.
She can trust you,
but she's not sure about the rest of us?
Don't you get it? She's trying to divide us.
She wouldn't do that.
Wouldn't she?
Wait. You were listening? This whole time?
We can't let her come between us.
I'd say you're doing a great job of that all on your own.
I'm sorry.
Don't!
Wow. The Greeks really know how to live.
You wanna throw another stack?
Are you kidding me? I'm just getting warmed up.
All right.
Hey, mom?
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Where have you been?
Um, just with Emily.
I got your message.
Yeah, so Jessica Dilaurentis is on the board at Radley.
And that must be why my dad changed--
I signed the agreement.
What? Wait when?
Before I got your message. It doesn't matter.
Of course it does. My dad manipulated you into signing it.
That may be true, but my dad and I had a long talk today
and we decided to move on from this.
It's the best thing for our family.
Toby, You can't do that.
There's clearly so much more
to this cover-up than we know.
What I know...
is my mother didn't kill herself.
Now whether she fell or some disturbed patient
pushed her doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?
How can it not matter? Don't you want to know
who that disturbed patient is?
Stop.
Let it go, Spencer. It's over.
Hey. It's me, Hanna.
I keep replaying the past few weeks
over and over again in my head.
Trying to pinpoint the exact moment I lost you.
Wondering if I could've done something differently.
But, I just wanted to let you know that...
It was the best year of my life.
Hey, you're just in time.
That looks amazing.
You have something...
No. I...
