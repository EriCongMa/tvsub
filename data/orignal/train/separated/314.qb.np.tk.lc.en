okay , max . how would you describe our apartment ?
and i &apos;ve already ruled out
&quot; worse than that girl @-@ pit in silence of the lambs . &quot;
well , at least she had some silence once in awhile .
look , no one &apos;s gonna pay money to rent this dump .
we haven &apos;t in six months .
everyone else in williamsburg is making money
renting their crappy places on airbnb .
it &apos;s all how you describe it .
so let &apos;s start lying .
this is a fantastic idea and i really want to do this .
first question : &quot; describe your neighborhood . &quot;
run @-@ down with a bunch of rats .
old @-@ world charm .
pet @-@ friendly .
&quot; what type of people live there ? &quot;
junkies , whores , homeless .
actors .
&quot; do you have a hot tub ? &quot;
sometimes .
&quot; gym ? &quot;
two . gay jim upstairs ,
and straight jim across the hall
who &apos;s only gay when he &apos;s drunk .
&quot; when is your space available ?
always , sometimes , one time . &quot;
oh , just like our sex lives .
always for me , sometimes out of boredom ,
and one time for you .
earl , guess what max and i did .
i know what you didn &apos;t do .
clean this dessert carousel .
there &apos;s a napoleon in here since napoleon .
we rented our apartment on airbnb .
you rented to arabs ?
well , good luck getting it back .
they tend to be a tad territorial .
airbnb is an agency that rents to out @-@ of @-@ towners
and i &apos;m guessing local men cheating on their wives .
well , i did it .
i know .
when you were 18 with prince harry .
or so you say .
we have three offers for our apartment .
how ?
let me rephrase that .
how !
i found the perfect sales pitch .
&quot; stay at the place where dreams die &quot; ?
&quot; have the authentic williamsburg experience . &quot;
oh , you mean getting clumsily felt up
by a guy who looks like he came from the gold rush ?
anyone can stay at a hotel .
but how often can you say you went to new york
and stayed at a &quot; brooklyn bohemian barn apartment
with a live @-@ in horse &quot; ?
girl , you are good .
so now we just have to pick who gets our apartment .
a guy looking to get away from it all .
that &apos;s a suicide .
you &apos;re right . we lie , they lie .
um , a married couple looking to reconnect .
murder @-@ suicide .
and finally , a girls &apos; getaway weekend
for some fashion model friends .
a couple of chubby girls looking to murder
some pints of ben and jerry &apos;s .
with maybe a sui @-@ side of mac and cheese .
hey , everybody .
yeah , the temperature be droppin&apos;
and the bitches be nippin &apos; .
i need a hot chocolate .
i &apos;m right , sophie .
and i &apos;m right here , earl .
i mean , i get it ,
but bro code , man .
well , big news .
i &apos;m going on a trip .
mushrooms or acid ?
i &apos;m going to vermont !
oh , you &apos;re gonna be gone ?
would you mind letting us stay upstairs at your place ?
we &apos;re renting out our apartment .
you &apos;re renting out that dump ?
oh , are they filming survivor at your place ?
so when are these losers arriving ?
they &apos;re not losers .
they &apos;re just girls paying us to have a fun weekend in our apartment .
what losers !
now that is a hand that &apos;s scooped some ice cream .
hi ,
are you caroline ?
oh , my god . they really are models .
hi , i &apos;m lily .
oh shoot , now i &apos;m gay .
lily ? as in lily aldridge ?
and i &apos;m martha .
hunt ? martha hunt and lily aldridge ?
max , do you know who they are ?
sure do .
this one is the girl that i leave this one for .
no , max , they &apos;re all victoria &apos;s secret models .
yeah , we all wanted to hang out in new york before we leave for london .
we &apos;re doing a fashion show there .
i worked at the victoria &apos;s secret at the mall for one day .
got fired for eating panda express over the thongs .
this is max . i &apos;m caroline .
i used to be rich .
i just felt like i needed to say that .
and these are our friends ,
petra , gabriella , and rina .
hi .
what are the odds you &apos;re all named after columbus &apos;s ships .
come in . welcome to &quot; the williamsburg experience . &quot;
it &apos;s bigger than it looks in the photo .
well , i shaved of a couple of inches for the photo .
you know the drill .
so why the hell are you staying here ?
is this training for when your looks run out ?
oh , look . the kitchen is so cute !
question : how do you walk the runway blind ?
it &apos;s just that we stay at the same four seasons all the time .
well , you will experience at least two seasons here ,
&apos;cause the thermostat &apos;s broken .
it &apos;s 40 outside and 100 in here .
so as advertised , this is our sauna .
and our bohemian barn &apos;s right out that door .
just follow the temperature drop .
max , super models are staying at our apartment .
it &apos;s so exciting , i want to tell all my friends .
i guess i just did .
i see you met chestnut .
that &apos;s his real mane , not extensions .
also per our ad , a charming skylight .
in case you want to sit under the stars
and have a little peace and quiet .
hey , girls !
come up already .
i want to get to my college reunion .
can you believe it &apos;s been 10 years ?
wow , time sure does lie--
i mean , fly .
you talk to your neighbors ?
i talked to my neighbor once and the next thing you know ,
i have this long letter from naomi watts
丈夫是演员列维 · 施瑞博尔
saying , &quot; leave my husband alone . &quot;
so we &apos;ve known each other like five minutes already .
where &apos;s my free bra ?
i mean , all that &apos;s left of this one is the frames .
trust me , it &apos;s like a burlesque show under here .
sophie &apos;s apartment is amazing .
it looks like an easter bunny banged a golden girl .
讲四个老年女士同住在一起的笑料
that was some showerhead .
i &apos;d marry it , but it &apos;s already attached ...
to the wall .
max ?
here !
oh , this bed is like being in the womb
without all the second @-@ hand smoke .
martha and lily were super @-@ sweet .
so exciting to be back hanging with celebrities .
yeah and maybe now you can get a new celebrity story .
i was getting really tired of hearing how someone thought
you were gwyneth paltrow from behind .
still flattering .
laughter ?
coming from our apartment ?
what do you think they &apos;re laughing at ?
probably found our account balance on an atm slip .
i bet martha said something funny .
she &apos;s hilarious .
you know , for someone who &apos;s so pretty ,
she never had to develop a personality .
i &apos;m gonna go see .
max , give me a shove .
this is good practice for the eventual cliff .
beers and wings .
beers and wings .
now it &apos;s a party .
max , you know how when it gets hot down there ,
we just sit , sweat , and point the fan at our junk ?
they do it a little differently .
they are dancing in their underwear ,
drinking beers .
so ? the guy on the corner does that all the time .
i can &apos;t take my eyes off those beers .
hey ! hi , you guys .
you wanna come down ,
and have some beers , and cool off ?
be right down !
now i wish i had those wings , i could get down there faster .
okay . so what is this big news ?
did the health inspector find out
that the imitation crab meat is cat ?
technically , it &apos;s imitation cat ,
but that &apos;s not what we &apos;re announcing .
i &apos;m here .
and make this snappy . i &apos;m in the middle of something .
puberty ?
no . i was on a call with ripley &apos;s believe it or not
to inform them that you still work here .
and they didn &apos;t believe it .
okay . we have some friends coming in for a meal
and we don &apos;t want you guys to embarrass us and overreact .
darlin &apos; , i don &apos;t overreact .
i &apos;m 70 @-@ something years old with a history of heart trouble .
i keep it in check .
hey , max ! caroline !
and i keep my heart pills in my pocket .
excuse me , much as i enjoy the view ,
i really want that &quot; 100th birthday &quot; shout out from al roker .
或者自己录制视频对不同的人喊话
yes , they &apos;re victoria &apos;s secret models and our friends .
last night we all stayed up late trashing kate moss .
models in my diner !
oh , no . i wore the wrong sweater vest .
you also wore the wrong face , body , and personality .
max , let &apos;s go say hi .
how do i look ?
like a waitress .
damn it , it &apos;s the waitress uniform , isn &apos;t it ?
what &apos;s up , homies ?
what &apos;s up , homie ?
i love my life again .
well , it &apos;s been a whole day since we met ,
so where &apos;s that free bra ?
max !
what ?
this one &apos;s on it &apos;s last legs .
last night i heard it coughing .
could also use some new underwear .
mine are running on fumes .
i just texted david .
he &apos;s coming .
this is going to be an amazing party .
party ?
yeah . we &apos;re having some friends over .
cool .
yeah ?
yeah .
and like max said , &quot; cool ! &quot;
jeez , pull it back .
you &apos;re acting needier than sofia vergara on a red carpet .
走红毯时十分享受所有人的注目
big fan .
big , big fan .
compliments of the chef .
my specialty , popsicles .
i find they taste best when sucked slowly ,
using plenty of tongue , facing the kitchen .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re not invited
to the biggest party in our apartment
since those ants found your jelly beans .
yoo @-@ hoo !
hi , so we &apos;re just up here hangin &apos; out .
doin &apos; our thang .
oh , sorry , girl . did we wake you ?
go back to sleep .
&quot; go back to sleep &quot; ?
why does she think we &apos;re so lame ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
maybe it &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re throwing around words
like &quot; yoo @-@ hoo &quot; and &quot; thang , &quot;
like a mom bringing cheetos
down to a slumber party .
this is your fault .
they were obsessed with us until you started asking for bras
like some bra @-@ less homeless person .
we &apos;re never gonna sleep with all that music .
check the drawer , sophie must have ear plugs .
i mean , she lives upstairs from you .
i found plugs , but i don &apos;t think they &apos;re for your ears .
it &apos;s fine , we &apos;ll just pop downstairs and say hello .
fashion &apos;s my scene .
know what i &apos;m seeing ? that price tag .
oh , tuck it back in , i have to return it .
okay . remember our deal .
i got up and got dressed so you &apos;re my slave for life .
oh , hi , girls .
i thought you were the man with the greek food .
wow , i have definitely got to start waxing my upper lip more .
sophie , why aren &apos;t you in vermont ?
oh , i lied .
i didn &apos;t go to vermont .
i mean , it &apos;s far and i &apos;m not a lesbian .
no , i stayed in town to spy on oleg .
i mean , i know you girls think that i &apos;m perfect ,
but i have trust issues .
well then , whose apartment is that ?
i &apos;m staying at jim &apos;s .
straight jim &apos;s or gay jim &apos;s ?
sophie , you forgot your purse .
oh , i think this is mine .
just kidding , it &apos;s yours .
what &apos;s up , salt n &apos; pepa ?
gay jim &apos;s .
oh , girls , please don &apos;t tell oleg that i &apos;m here .
you know , i &apos;ve been following him around
to see what he would do if i was not in town .
and so far , you know , he &apos;s been cool .
but you know the old saying :
&quot; cheat on me once , shame on you .
cheat on me twice , your balls are in a jar . &quot;
oh , my god ! there &apos;s a man standing in our doorway .
i have a doorman again .
weird to see a man standing in our doorway
without a warrant , an eviction notice , or a bible .
excuse me , this is our apartment .
yeah , we live here all the time .
no biggie .
no biggie , and no electricity , no lease @-@ y .
hi , i &apos;m caroline . this is max .
we live here .
not according to the list .
sir , look , we do live here . i have a key .
the key is to be on the list , which you are not .
okay , i can prove we live here .
go over to the window , kick the side of radiator ,
a panel will open up .
you &apos;ll find a half @-@ smoked joint and another half @-@ smoked joint .
proving--
what ?
that you &apos;re a poor pot head ?
this is crazy .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m begging to get into a place
i &apos;ve been trying to get out of .
it &apos;s a very exclusive party .
it &apos;s a dump .
i should know . i live here .
this night couldn &apos;t get any worse .
turn that light off .
i &apos;m watching the victoria &apos;s secret super model party
with my night vision goggles .
and updating .
oleg , how did you get in here ?
how do you think ?
it &apos;s my girlfriend &apos;s apartment .
i broke in .
yes , oleg , it &apos;s your girlfriend &apos;s apartment
where you &apos;re sitting in the dark ,
watching models out the window with night vision goggles .
hey ! my pants are on !
no , they are not !
not my fault .
five victoria &apos;s secret super models downstairs ?
they took themselves off .
so what are you saying ? you &apos;re the victim here ?
what would sophie say if she came home
and saw you sitting here ?
she &apos;d say , &quot; stop hogging the goggles . &quot;
oleg , let me just say this :
vermont is closer than you think .
i don &apos;t know where this argument is going ,
but i &apos;m going to that damn supermodel party .
oleg , it &apos;s late , i &apos;m gonna lay this on the line for you .
you &apos;re no george clooney .
you &apos;re not even george costanza .
these sheets are amazing
and you are never gonna do better than sophie .
she is hot
and clearly has no sense of smell .
i love sophie .
i &apos;ll go home .
on second thought , i don &apos;t trust myself
to walk by your apartment .
better lock me in here .
caroline ! max ! come down here ! hurry !
i knew it ! see , max ?
they &apos;re begging us to come .
i &apos;m back again .
are you coming ?
oh , let me think .
downstairs with an open bar or up here ,
alone , with oleg in his tighty @-@ not @-@ that @-@ whities ?
should we tie you up ?
no , it &apos;ll just make me hornier .
i knew they wanted us to come to the party !
how could they not ?
last night i taught petra how to eat bread
without tearing it into little pieces first .
don &apos;t try it . i was a navy seal .
you think you &apos;re tough ?
i lived in a refrigerator box for a month .
with no top .
not the box . me .
max , caroline , get in here .
hey !
see we were invited .
&apos;cause we &apos;re &quot; a &quot; list .
the toilet is clogged
and i need you to take care of it , please .
&quot; a list &quot;
as in &quot; a &quot; janitor list .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
can one of you call the concierge ?
sure . caroline !
wait , wait , wait-- you didn &apos;t just call us down here
&apos;cause the toilet &apos;s clogged , did you ?
no .
okay , good .
the kitchen sink is backed up , too .
but , toilet , i got this .
i was almost born in one .
excuse me , excuse me , excuse me , excuse me .
all right , everyone just calm down .
no need to overreact .
and there &apos;s the pool we mentioned in our ad .
oh , boy .
yup , we got some floaters .
caroline , i &apos;m gonna need the plunger and a lobotomy .
切除后会对人产生情绪 及各方面功能有巨大影响
this happens with vintage toilets .
part of their old @-@ world charm .
we got some charm stuck on your loofah .
hey guys , remember last night
how we just bit into that bread without chewing it ?
good times .
i need that damn plunger , i don &apos;t want to die this way .
got it , but it &apos;s caught on something .
what kind of a dump is this ?
hey ! you wanted the williamsburg experience ,
this is it !
good news , martha . i have your flat iron
looking pretty much back to normal .
oh , that &apos;s good . keep it .
again , sorry about your cashmere sweaters in here .
but when we ran out of paper towels ,
you did scream , &quot; just use anything , make it stop . &quot;
and of course , we &apos;ll pay to have them all dry cleaned .
oh , that &apos;s nice . keep them .
okay , we can leave .
i am off the phone with my therapist .
and it goes without saying ,
we won &apos;t charge you guys for this weekend .
no way . here .
you are taking this check and my therapist &apos;s phone number .
i do not know how you are standing up without him .
what ? come on , this is nothing .
one month , the floor actually opened up and swallowed us .
yeah , we &apos;ve been through worse .
oh , it &apos;s really cool the way you two support each other .
yup , we &apos;re a pair of support hose .
and speaking of support--
here , max .
no way !
look , caroline , it &apos;s a bra @-@ nanza !
and , caroline , since you don &apos;t really need to wear a bra ...
here . this apartment may be hell ,
but you are a real angel .
aw , my own wings ?
thank you , guys .
hey , can i ask you something ?
as long as it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with rats .
how come you didn &apos;t invite us to the party ?
what ? i thought martha did .
i thought lily did .
model moment !
pick @-@ up , caroline !
yup , i always knew you would die here .
pick @-@ up , max !
looking good , max .
after you drop that , have caroline come back here
and lock me in the walk @-@ in till sophie gets home .
max , i just realized we &apos;re kind of the supermodels of waitressing .
and i just realized my boobs aren &apos;t always supposed to hit my side .
