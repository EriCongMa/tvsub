Hey.
Hey.
Do you have plans this weekend?
I'm thinking we should talk about the homework assignment.
I know that you're not crazy about having me for a lab partner.
It's okay.
Any guy at this party
would be happy to be with me.
We've already talked about this, okay?
Why are you taking Sean's car? Hanna!
And you will work off the cost of repairs
in Sean's mother's office.
What's a Golden Orchid?
It's a national competition for historical writing.
More academic bling for spencer.
I saw the way you were looking at my dad yesterday.
I have eyes.
Find someone who's available.
My dad isn't.
Mom? There's something you should know.
Somebody's been in the house.
小贱人们 -A
问问你女儿吧 她什么都知道
"A" sent this letter to my mom.
You know it's not your fault, right?
It's your dad's mistake, totally.
No, it is my fault.
You did not hook up with her
and then ask your kid to cover for you.
Ali said I should've told my mom right after it happened.
Ali? Alison knew?
Yeah, she was with me.
So, Alison saw this Meredith person?
Meredith? Her name is Meredith.
Ew. That's not even a cute-girl name.
I'm seeing big pores and mousy roots.
Hanna, I think it's a little too soon to joke.
I'm sorry, but if you're gonna cheat,
you might as well do it with somebody
who deep-conditions her hair occasionally.
Here, put something in your mouth
besides your foot.
I'm sorry. Okay?
Look, all I'm saying is that when my dad left,
laughing sometimes helped.
So did crying.
My father hasn't left, guys.
I mean, this happened over a year ago.
You think he's gonna leave?
Look, whatever happens, we're here for you.
Thank you guys for staying here.
I couldn't have been here alone.
When's your family getting back?
This afternoon.
Weren't you gonna clean off the mirror before they get here?
Want me to come with?
We should all go.
Uh, yeah, you know what?
It doesn't take four of us to clean a mirror,
so why don't you three go, and I'll just wait here.
Fine. You stay down here.
Alone.
But make sure you lock the door.
Great. You spray, I'll wipe.
Well, the creature's back.
We should've never unblocked our phone.
Open the attachment.
That's us!
Was that shot from inside your closet?
"A" was watching us!
Guys.
Check it out.
How do you not poke your eyeball?
What's up?
Uh, nothing.
Look, um...
are mom and dad acting weird with each other?
What do you mean?
I mean, I don't know.
There's a vibe.
Yeah, maybe.
Look, don't worry about it, okay?
You're only gonna do one eye?
Is that a new Cyclops look?
Listen, I can take them to practice if you want--
I can do it.
Well, I'm done by 3:00.
I'll do it.
Should we find someone to talk to?
A counselor, therapist?
You would feel more comfortable talking to a stranger
in some office than you would in your own kitchen?
Yeah, but we're not talking, Ella.
Are you done with this?
See you later.
Bye.
See ya.
All right, tell me what I need to do to make this better.
Do you want me to move out?
Don't make that my decision.
Well, do you think it would help?
How,
by making me deal with their confusion alone,
or by making me the bad guy
that kicked their dad out?
Are they gonna be any less confused seeing
us walk around here like sulky roommates?
We're not--
Hey.
Do you want some breakfast? There's yogurt.
No, I'm--I'm good with a granola bar.
I'm going to, uh, going to go to work.
I've got office hours.
Hey, good luck with that French test, sweetheart.
Look, Mike knows something's up.
Are you gonna tell him?
Yeah. You know, when I can.
Okay, well, just don't wait too long.
It was way too hard to keep it from you for a year.
I don't want to have to do that to him, too.
A year? You've known about this for a year?
Yeah. I thought dad...
He didn't tell you that he asked me to--?
Mom, I can miss first period
if you want to talk.
It's okay.
This is between me and your dad.
Don't worry.
Need some help?
Oh, hi. Hey.
No, no, I got it.
Um, stupid shoe.
My mom forgot to mention the new job required a uniform, huh?
No, it's cool. I like it.
Hideous looks good on me.
Listen, I tried-- I know that--
Sorry. What were you gonna say?
I tried to take the fall for the car.
You did? Why?
I felt really bad about
what went down at Noel's party,
So I told my parents I gave you the keys
And I'd pay for the repairs.
No. No, I should pay for the repairs.
It was my fault.
Besides, I think working in a dentist office
will help me with my fear.
Scared of dentists?
Children.
Your mom is making me hand out
sugar-free lollypops to six-year-olds.
They don't bite at that age, do they?
Look, I know that we haven't talked
since that night,
but since we are now,
do you wanna talk about homecoming?
I mean, do you still wanna go?
You know, with me?
I, uh, hadn't really thought about it.
Coach has us on a lot of two-a-days.
That's a lot of pressure.
And with everything else going on, I just...
Yeah, no, I get it.
No, well, we--
We should. Talk about it.
I gotta go. That's my ride.
You cannot seriously think
that a blind girl broke into my house.
That would take a lot more
than a talking GPS.
Well, I didn't say that Jenna was alone.
Let's no go to the Toby place, okay?
Why not?
You guys think her guide dog left behind his lipstick?
Yeah, do you want to ask
what your lab partner was doing last night?
You know, maybe he took a break from sitting on his porch
pulling the heads off of squirrels.
Spencer! Sorry,
ladies, I didn't mean to interrupt,
But I hope you're as proud of
your friend as I am.
Congratulations.
My instincts were right.
This just makes it official.
What's that about?
An essay contest.
Wait, did you win it?
Aren't you gonna at least open the envelope?
Why should she? She wins an award for waking up.
Sodium borate.
Easy. That glass beaker's made of... glass.
Maybe you should do it.
I've had too much coffee and not enough sleep.
Big party on a thursday night?
No, I-- slept at a friend's.
What did you do last night?
Sat at the grill doing homework.
That's where you study?
Got to.
Jenna listens to her lectures loudly,
And it messes me up.
She doesn't like using her headphones at home.
Why the grill? It's not exactly quiet there, either.
It is if you stay late enough.
I close the place, like, every night.
So, whose house did you stay at last night?
That new girl?
Who, Maya?
Why would you think that?
Just figured that she's the newest member of your posse.
Has she learned the secret handshake yet?
She's... more my friend than the group's.
Why is that?
She just cares about different things.
Different's good. I like different.
This town has too much of the same.
Hey, there.
Hey.
I've been thinking about you.
Uh, how are things with your family?
They're tense and getting worse.
Can you give me an excuse not to go home?
Extra credit assignment
or six-hour detention?
Um... i'm sorry, I actually can't stay late today.
Uh, I've got this... thing.
Oh.
Well, no, it's-- it's not a thing.
It's just a, um... thing.
A reading of a story.
that I wrote.
You're reading it out loud?
Can I come?
You can, but if it sucks...
I'm going to hurt myself.
You'd be a witness.
It could get ugly.
You're the teacher.
I'm the student, remember?
Do you like the color?
Thank you.
Hey. Those are for you.
Butter creams.
They're your favorite, right?
Yeah, they were... when I was, like, seven.
Thanks, daddy.
So, you finally spoke to Wren?
No, but I spoke with Mr. Sheldrake.
You didn't really think you were gonna be able
to keep this essay secret, did you?
Spencer, this is a coup for you.
I mean, if the Ivies weren't onto you already,
they are now.
I'm seeing a cage match between Harvard and Yale.
Dad, it's really not that big of a deal.
Oh, now you tell me.
Your mother's already taken out a full-page ad
in the club newsletter.
I'm kidding. Come on.
Have a butter cream.
I'm proud of you, Spence.
At least let me brag about you tomorrow.
What's tomorrow?
I'm taking Russell Newhoff to the club.
He's a potential new client.
You up for playing doubles if he brings his daughter along?
Sure! Hey, you want to volley with me?
Oh, I'd love to, but...
I have a bunch of calls to return,
And a prize-winning essay to read.
Don't forget to put it on my desk, okay?
Oh, dad, I-- you don't have to read this one.
It's really not one of my best.
Somebody sure thought it was.
They don't give these awards to people who don't deserve them.
Hello, dental office. Just a minute, please.
Hello?
Can I help you?
No. No, I was just, um,
looking for a place to toss medical waste.
Must be a different floor.
Thanks for your help.
I didn't think this would take so long.
I don't mind.
I like being in school when nobody else is.
Viscosity, elasticity, and tensile strength.
Anything else we need to cover?
Maybe our noses. This stuff's rank.
Oh, god!
I'm so sorry.
It's just water.
Did you draw this?
It looks just like the cover
from this band, Circa Survive.
This is so good.
You know that band?
My cousin works at a bar on south street.
He snuck me into a show.
Have you heard any of their new stuff yet?
It's totally...
Amazing.
If-- if you're into them, there's this...
other band I should turn you onto.
I'll bring you a CD.
Thanks.
I should go.
I'm gonna be late for swim practice.
Um, Emily?
Yeah?
My notebook.
Oh, jeez.
I totally need more sleep.
Or more coffee.
Wanna meet up at the grill later?
Sure.
"And in an instant, her life was undone.
Everything she'd known disappeared,
Drifting into the summer sky."
Thank you.
He doesn't suck, huh?
You know this guy?
Yeah. He's my english teacher.
Oh, very cool. Me and him go way back.
We used to sleep together.
Bunk beds! College.
Do you have a name, fangirl?
Oh, Aria.
Hardy.
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, I thought I'd get some face time
with the president of your fan club, apparently.
You two know each other?
Yeah, well, not as well as you two know each other.
I, uh, I heard about the bunk beds.
We just met, but I'm glad I sat next to her.
She kept kicking me so I wouldn't snore.
No, no, no, seriously,
how did you know about this?
I don't live in a cave.
I saw it on the website,
thought it was my duty to come heckle you.
I think I should be in a cave.
Was it really that bad?
No, it was beautiful.
And that metaphor at the end?
That was a metaphor?
I thought it was really about a kid who lost her balloon.
You also thought "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" was Mexican porn.
That's true.
Books aren't his thing, you know?
He used to pay me in frozen burritos to write his papers.
You know what'd be great is if you told this same lame story
while I had a beer in my hand.
I'm grabbing a waitress.
I didn't know he was gonna be here.
Good serve.
Listen, hate to interrupt, be we're kind of closed.
I was supposed to shut down the courts ten minutes ago.
Seriously? Can you just give me another five minutes?
Are you practicing for a tournament or something?
No, um. No, it's just a friendly game of doubles
with my dad and some guests.
Well, you and I have very different ideas of what's friendly.
That's an angry serve.
Well, it's been a long week.
Kind of been storing it up.
A strong slice is only half the battle.
You've got to kill it on the return, too, you know.
Well, I'm just warming up.
So I hook up with her in the library,
but you can't get serious
in the sociology stacks, right?
So I take her back to my dorm room.
I can't believe you're telling this story.
Let him finish. I want to hear.
She wants to hear!
So, I get her back.
You know, he's sound asleep, of course.
I get her shirt off, things are happening,
life is good, and then this geek,
right here, starts laughing in his sleep.
Now, he's done this before, but this chick,
she does not believe that he's asleep.
Which I was.
You laugh in your sleep?
Mm-hmm.
That's cute.
It's better than snoring.
Right. Uh, you were up.
Ah, no. It's her turn.
Take it for me. I'm gonna grab some water.
Dude, you are so screwed.
It--it's not what you think it is.
Don't give me that look.
I didn't pursue this. It just happened.
And that makes it okay?
Hardy--
Ezra, she's cute. She's smart.
I get it. There's no argument,
but she's your student, man.
That's not how I met her.
It doesn't matter.
When this is all over, she's gonna get her diploma.
You're gonna get a pink slip and an orange jumpsuit.
Okay, so how about this?
The loser of the next game buys fries?
Sweet. Give it up.
You in?
Thanks for this. I'm having fun.
Yeah, me too.
Here you go.
Here, I'll go.
Sorry I'm late.
Boss got chatty when they dropped the check.
But I only ate one lamb chop.
The rest are yours.
What are we looking at?
The worst part of my day.
You know, I thought it bottomed out
when a kid aimed at me for a rinse-and-spit,
But now there's an Amber.
What's an Amber?
Amber is "A cheerleader at Rollins High
who loves skinny lattes."
Here.
See for yourself.
She's cute.
She's trying to date Sean.
She's evil.
We know this for a fact?
Well, she's suddenly become his personal driver
and god knows what else.
Driving is not dating.
Eat.
Mom! Why are you feeding me
when my boyfriend left me
for someone who weighs 11 pounds?
He hasn't left you. His car's in the shop.
So why can't he hitch a ride with someone who's not majoring in cartwheels?
I am sorry that you don't have a car of your own to drive.
You have to talk to your father about that.
No, thanks.
Besides, he's probably already picked one out for Kate.
Kate? Thought her name was Isabel.
That's the mother.
The girlfriend.
The fiancee.
He's marrying her?
Yeah, I found that out
before I went to Spencer's last night.
I didn't see you this morning,
so I thought it'd be kind of weird to text you.
Yeah. That would've been weird.
Thanks.
Still, I'd rather hear it from you than from him.
I'm not surprised. We've both moved on.
Try the baguette. It's delicious.
汉娜被甩了 艾米丽被亲了 -A
I saved it, just in case.
I'm telling you,
that's the lipstick Jenna was putting on in the elevator.
Are you sure?
Yes! That's Alison's color.
Same shade, same tube.
What I'm wondering is why was Jenna
in an empty room for an hour?
I think we should call the police.
There are fingerprints on this tube.
Well, yeah, ours.
Look, if we are not gonna answer any more questions,
just let me get in the office and see what I can find.
Have you gotten any more e-mails?
Not since this morning. Have you?
No. I'm just wondering.
Emily!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Uh, I was just
Hanna had a run-in with Jenna Marshall today.
Sit down.
Emily, You know that dentist office I'm working at?
Well, I was going in for my shift after school,
and I was in the elevator. Jenna Marshall was in there.
She had the same lipstick Ali wore.
The exact same color.
She had the same lipstick as Ali.
She had Alison's lipstick.
She was putting it on.
So, are all college boys like the ones in that bar?
Is it possible to say hello to a guy
without putting them in a headlock?
Well, maybe when you go to college, you'll...
find out for yourself.
Okay, stop.
Did Hardy say something...
about us or about me?
No, why would he?
I was just having fun at a bar
with a high school student.
You make it sound so awful.
Well, maybe it is.
I mean, if you think about it--
Well, why?
Was I acting like a high school girl?
Did I do anything to embarrass you?
Look, have I ever done that?
No, it's not about that.
Okay, then what is it about?
I mean, is this Hardy's problem,
or is it yours?
Where did this come from?
Age is never an issue when we're together.
When it's just the two of us,
but when we're out in the world, people notice.
No, Hardy noticed.
Look, he's your friend,
and if you're okay with it,
I really doubt it's gonna bother him.
Aria, let's get real.
In theory, we are a lot more wrong than we are right.
You wanna be real? Forget about theory.
What does it feel like when we're together?
Good. It feels...right.
I wanna be with you.
I wanna hang out in a bar,
introduce you to my friends,
split a plate of fries like everybody else,
but I don't think we can do that.
When I'm with you,
I don't care about anybody else.
So, are you talking yourself into this or out of it?
Yes!
N-no! Maybe.
So?
Let's review.
Look, we're here now, and it's just the two of us
and it feels good.
So let's not care together.
Where you going?
I have an early tennis day with my dad,
And I have no idea what I'm gonna wear.
There, um, may be this boy--
Boy! What boy? Details!
Well, there's none yet, but I'll keep you guys posted.
Are you Emily?
No. Em?
Someone left this for you.
Pretty. Who made that?
Somebody from school.
Well, whoever made it must like you a lot.
No, we were just talking about
this band we both like.
Is it from somebody you like back?
Sorry. You don't have to tell me anything.
But, Em...
If there's someone in your life
Who cares about you, then I'm happy for you.
No matter who they are.
Bye.
Wait.
You sure you have to go?
Yeah. Yeah, it was so weird when I left home this morning.
I'm not really sure what I'm gonna walk into.
I liked having you here.
Well, I didn't say I wasn't coming back.
What if I cook us dinner tomorrow night?
Oh, you cook?
Yeah. How do you feel about enhanced
macaroni and cheese?
Uh, frightened.
What do you mean by "enhanced"?
Well, it means I'm cooking fettuccini,
But I don't want you to get your hopes up.
Hey, champ.
How was practice yesterday?
Good. I'm ready to bury them.
Heh, yeah. You know, about that.
You might want to keep it friendly on the court, okay?
Why does everyone think I'm unfriendly?
I'm serious, Spence.
Turns out Newhoff and his daughter
aren't exactly Venus and Serena,
So just dial it back a bit.
But, dad,
I was out there for five hours yesterday swatting balls.
Well, good, then you'll hopefully be a little sore.
Are you asking me to throw the match?
Spencer, I'm asking you to just look at this
as a... means to an end, okay?
If he wins, I win. Got it?
Easy!
Ah, Martha. You're here.
Next time, just push the button.
Excuse me?
Push the button. That tells me you're here.
Okay.
Since it's your first visit,
there's some paperwork.
Why don't you fill it out in my office?
I'm still renovating out here.
Please, have a seat.
Phillip said this was your first time.
You'll be fine.
Let me grab a new patient file,
And we can get started.
Psychotherapy.
You're her therapist.
You just said her therapist.
Martha, is there someone else joining us today?
Is everything all right?
Martha doesn't want therapy.
Martha has to go.
Okay, I told you something was up.
Can you hear them?
Look, whatever it is, it's not about us.
How do you know?
I just do.
Look, go get your stuff. We'll go to the library.
We'll study there, okay?
Yeah, but for how long?
Just get your stuff.
She lives in this town.
I have to see her. I have to talk to her.
I befriended this woman.
Ella, trust me.
It is over.
Trust you?!
She means nothing to me,
and I'm not gonna let Her take away from me what matters most.
And what is it that matters to you?
Because clearly it is not us.
Do you want me to find another job
teaching at a different college?
Do you want to pick up and move again?
Because I will. I'll do that.
Is that what iceland was all about?
Yeah. In a way, it was,
Because I wanted things to be the way they used to be with us.
And how was that,
me looking like a complete and total idiot-- because look at this.
Look at this stupidly happy woman
standing next to her loving husband.
What am I supposed to do with all these family photos
Of our romantic trip abroad?
Stop that! Stop it.
What happened with her was a mistake.
What I know is that
you used our daughter to hide this from me.
How could you do that to her?
I don't even know who you are!
I panicked. I thought I didn't have another choice.
I was scared. I was afraid I would lose you.
You just might.
Mission accomplished.
You have a question?
No.
We'll meet you in the lobby, okay?
Did you waste your real game yesterday?
What? No, I was just off.
No, you weren't, not when the match started.
Look, it's a long story.
And it was important for our guests to win.
And so the only way for you to do that was for you to lose?
What's up with that?
Did your dad ask you to do that, or...
Look, he's not always like this.
Whatever you say. I just-- I see a lot of it here.
Lot of what?
People playing games...
Just off the court, you know?
Yeah.
Is there any chance you'd want to hang out sometime?
Like, not here?
Yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Hanna, do you want these?
I wore them once. They gave me a nosebleed.
I think they're a little too dressy for a dental office.
Well, you've got some events coming up.
What are you wearing to homecoming?
Mom, I don't know if I'm going to homecoming.
Of course you're going.
If you're breathing, you're going.
What's up?
You still haven't heard from Sean?
He said we'd talk, but it hasn't happened,
So I'm just giving him space.
Don't give him too much.
I tried that with your father.
He found a woman in Maryland who graduated with honors
from William and Mary
and loves to golf.
How do you know that?
I googled her.
I'm so sorry, mom.
No...
I'm sorry.
I'm the last person who should be giving anyone relationship advice.
I had too much pride to tell your father that I wanted him back.
And now...
Maybe you can wear these to his wedding.
On the links.
Please tell me you have a really deep pan,
And please tell me I left my phone here.
You did.
Ezra.
What's wrong?
I was trying to work and it kept buzzing.
I thought it was an emergency,
Your parents or something,
I looked at it, um...
Just take it.
Who's "A"?
I don't know.
How many of your friends did you tell?
I didn't.
Cause if "A" Knows,
I'm thinking "B" And "C" and everybody else knows, too.
The person who sent this is not my friend.
You told me you were mature enough to handle this.
Do you know what would happen if the school board or anybody...
I didn't tell anyone. You have to believe me.
Well, I don't.
Just go.
Go!
Now.
Hey, there.
Still looking for that trash chute.
Uh, no, I left something at my desk this morning.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
How much does he want?
For two tickets?
I didn't pay that much to see Lionel Richie
when he was Lionel Richie.
Hanna?
Hi.
Are you, uh, working today?
Um, I didn't, yeah. What are you doing here?
My mom left some insurance papers on the desk.
They won't release my car until...
Wait, you're getting it back?
Yeah, on Monday.
So, you won't need anyone to drive you around anymore?
You know, someone else?
Um, that's sort of the plan.
Great!
Well, um, I'll see you later.
All right.
See ya.
Are we over?
What?
Look, I'd rather you just tell me now
Before it's too late.
What's too late? What are you talking about?
If you want to take someone else to homecoming,
Sean, you should.
Why would I do that?
It's not like I'd actually go with anyone else.
So what are you doing
with that skinny latte who drives you around?
Amber? No, she just drives me to school for our meetings.
This club I joined.
R.L.W. Stands for "Real love waits."
Go ahead. Make a joke.
Is it some kind of holy-roller virgin society?
Look, I just thought hanging out with other people
who feel the same way as I do
will make it easier to hold out, you know?
No, I get it.
Could I go with you to the next meeting?
Why? You wanna join?
Well, we already tried doing it my way,
So let's try now doing it your way.
Excuse me.
Don't tell me that's how you want to celebrate--
With a pear? Put that away!
You deserve a three-course meal tonight.
Think I'll pass.
Pass?
Honey, you're the guest of honor.
You won a national award
and helped me sign Newhoff,
which almost didn't happen.
Why, didn't I hit the net enough?
No, you were perfect,
But things almost fell apart
while you guys were in the locker room.
What happened?
Oh, well, he expected lunch at the club.
Of course, I didn't make a reservation,
So there were no tables.
We sat at your favorite table.
After I made a scene.
I had to tell the manager that
The kid on the courts forgot to call it in.
Who, Alex?
Wait, will he be in trouble over this?
Who cares?
Kid can pick up balls anywhere, right?
We snagged a major client, Spence.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Just did what I had to do.
To win?
Don't give me that attitude.
Spencer, you're just as driven and competitive as I am.
Don't pretend you're not.
You know what? You're right. I am.
I'm just not sure it's a thing that I want to celebrate anymore.
And by the way, you don't have to read my essay.
Why not?
Because I stole it.
But I'm gonna win a big, fat award,
So I'm guessing you're okay with that.
You know, 'cause winning's all that matters, right?
Hey.
I was hoping you'd be here.
Why?
I really like tracks three, seven, and nine.
Nine was the best.
And I'm sorry about last night.
Really sorry.
What's that?
Something I made for you.
There are a couple girly songs,
So you have to keep an open mind.
Coffee, please.
Hey.
Hey.
You ready?
Yeah.
Cool, then.
Let's go.
Okay.
What is this?
Dinner.
Is mom still in her room?
Yeah.
And dad?
Do you think they're gonna work this out?
I really don't know.
