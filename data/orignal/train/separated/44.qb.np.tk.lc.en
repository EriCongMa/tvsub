how &apos;s my sis doing , as a lawyer ?
good . great , really .
well , don &apos;t tell her that .
she @-@ she works best when she &apos;s worried
that she &apos;s not living up to other people &apos;s expectations .
that &apos;s good to know .
as soon as i hear something , i &apos;ll let you know .
i brought you something from botswana .
how ... nice .
and here i thought you were gone for another two weeks .
came back early . isn &apos;t that fun ?
we &apos;ve been getting better acquainted .
okay . so that makes me nervous .
so i &apos;ll let you two talk .
just one quick thing .
the murphy &amp; gomes suit ?
yeah , we &apos;re ... we &apos;re right on target .
no , some ...
murphy &apos;s son .
he got picked up last night at cook state college on a drug charge .
prescription stimulant-- small @-@ time .
but i guess it &apos;s quite the thing to do during finals week .
first offense ?
yeah . a 1410 at the worst .
look , i could put a junior associate on it ,
but murphy &amp; gomes is such a cash cow .
no , no . don &apos;t worry about it . i &apos;ve got it .
kalinda will phone when she finds out where he &apos;s being processed .
owen . it &apos;s really nice to meet you .
oh , nice to meet you , too , will--
what was it again ?
gardner .
gardner , of course .
that &apos;s a familiar name .
what happened , owen ?
you &apos;re supposed to be on vacation .
okay , look , i broke up with kevin .
it &apos;s not a big deal , but i just don &apos;t want to have a big harangue about it .
oh , owen , i thought kevin was the keeper .
he was .
he &apos;s not anymore .
may i ?
oh , please .
what happened ?
he cheated on me .
when ? on vacation ?
you know , i don &apos;t even care .
i &apos;m just going to live alone ,
like an aging writer with dogs .
open your present .
so , are you hiding out ?
yeah , on your couch . open your present .
it &apos;s an mbukushu wig ,
worn by african women when they work .
put it on .
how thoughtful .
yeah .
drexel and 61st street .
his name is jonathan murphy , 22 .
how long ago ?
an hour .
they won &apos;t agree to a 1410 until he ids the dealer .
what ? why ?
ah , it &apos;s a slow friday .
they &apos;re being hard @-@ asses .
i &apos;ll be right there .
don &apos;t pick a fight with peter .
i &apos;m only an hour behind you .
look at you , going off to war .
don &apos;t forget your headdress .
two ?
yep .
jonathan and his girlfriend ,
alexis symanski .
they &apos;ve been together for six months .
does she have a lawyer ?
nope . she can &apos;t afford one .
hey . what &apos;s the holdup ?
what do you think ?
asa involvement .
hey , i can &apos;t even wipe my nose without asa giving the okay .
we &apos;ll be okay .
doesn &apos;t work that way .
yes , it can .
and since when did i become the optimist here ?
sorry .
hi .
i &apos;m your father &apos;s lawyer , alicia florrick .
you &apos;re jonathan , is that correct ?
jon . yeah , hi .
and you are ... ?
alexis .
i &apos;m with the firm representing jon &apos;s father ,
but i can also process this for you if you &apos;d like .
thanks .
okay . so you were both picked up
for buying prescription drugs for private use . is that correct ?
i was . he was just ...
no , that &apos;s not true .
look , i needed to stay up late and study for finals .
i work two jobs .
no , don &apos;t listen to her .
she doesn &apos;t take drugs .
i was the one who suggested getting them .
okay .
what you two just did there is fine for me ,
but don &apos;t do that in front of the police .
okay .
look , the state &apos;s attorney
will offer a 1410 probation citing .
that &apos;s a case that remains active but with no conviction .
then jon will have a record ?
for some time .
it &apos;s just , um , we both want to go to law school .
will you excuse me ?
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not here to make your life harder .
i just need an id .
are there any other asas in the district attorney &apos;s office ,
or are you the only one ?
i &apos;m the only one assigned to
lockhart &amp; gardner cases .
hey , kalinda .
cary .
so here &apos;s the deal , cary .
we id your drug dealer , we get drug school ,
no record .
okay . i can agree to that .
why ?
why can i agree to that ?
i don &apos;t know . you want me not to agree to that ?
well , i want you to tell us what &apos;s up .
well , we think this dealer killed a pharmacist
last night during a burglary , and we think
these kids can help us catch him , or her .
sketch artist or photo array ?
photo .
so you have someone in mind , then .
we do .
we think this dealer is a known associate of a name
from your past , lemond bishop .
you want my client to id a lieutenant
for the most dangerous drug gang in chicago .
i want your clients to do their civic duty .
so , why don &apos;t you two take a minute ?
make the deal .
cary can make their life miserable .
nail them on possession .
bishop won &apos;t touch murphy &apos;s son .
who ?
his girlfriend .
and she &apos;s our problem , why ?
girlfriend , boyfriend , they seem to come as a package .
yeah ... have kalinda look into
their antigang protections , and keep me in the loop .
make the deal .
will gardner , lawyer extraordinaire .
yeah , i got a new tie and everything .
so , can i kiss you here ,
or is that unprofessional ?
so , you ready ?
i was born ready .
thanks for arranging this .
rodney !
hey , tamara .
so this is the guy i was talking about .
mr. washington , will gardner .
sorry , i don &apos;t shake lawyers &apos; hands .
he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s joking .
derrick rose already has an agent ,
two business managers , three lawyers and me .
why does he need a fourth lawyer ?
career longevity .
we stay with him no matter what he does .
well , derrick was asking about you .
he was not .
a book , movie , more sponsorships ,
no matter what .
okay , well , i &apos;ll talk to derrick about it .
and i &apos;m going to have him call you .
stop , stop .
i need to get your pants off .
it &apos;s me .
alicia &apos;s not here .
yeah , she ... gave me her keys .
i &apos;m here to stay the night .
notice the suitcases ?
well , then , you &apos;d better come in .
fun times .
him .
he looked a bit different , though , without the sideburns .
good . good .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s helpful .
and did you see him the night before ,
on that corner , around 11 ?
no .
so you two were near that corner .
no .
i mean , we didn &apos;t see him there ,
but not because he wasn &apos;t there ,
but because we weren &apos;t there .
you were ... where ?
where were you two ?
in the library .
in the library .
both of you .
yeah . yeah .
why ?
no reason .
okay . i may need you two to stick around for a lineup .
hey , i was just trying to phone you .
yeah , something &apos;s weird here .
i just checked on antigang preparations .
there are none .
there are ...
what do you mean ?
there &apos;s no investigation of a dealer .
it &apos;s all a scam to get our clients talking .
that &apos;s it . we &apos;re done .
get up , both of you .
no , please stay .
get up now . we &apos;re out the door .
no .
you are . they &apos;re under arrest for murder .
what ?
for the murder of the pharmacist .
so how long have you known derrick rose ?
are you really getting jealous of derrick rose ?
how positively charming .
i have a better average from the free throw line .
see ? tv .
i see that .
square knobs .
you know , if it were between you and derrick rose ...
derrick rose ?
yeah . sorry .
a girl has to keep up her standards .
but you and me , we &apos;re having fun , right ?
i am . are you ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m still here .
i have to get that .
i know . then do .
derrick would have no problem with that .
yeah .
they &apos;re being accused of murder .
who ?
jonathan murphy and his girlfriend .
prescription drugs were traced to a pharmacy
that was burglarized last night .
the pharmacist surprised the burglar
and was shot-- killed .
okay , i get it . kalinda &apos;s on it ?
yeah , but i need backup .
on my way .
and you &apos;re on your way .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s an important client .
i wouldn &apos;t do this for anyone .
have fun .
maybe i &apos;ll give derrick a call .
it &apos;s good that you called .
we can find a better price with the full floor .
all right .
i &apos;ll be there in 15 minutes .
who was that ?
alicia .
did you ask her ?
no . it &apos;s about murphy / gomes .
murphy &apos;s son is being accused of murder .
he what ?
will is on his way to help .
murphy / gomes could mean a lot if he came with us .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
it &apos;ll go fast .
in this market ? i doubt it .
we &apos;ll be fine .
i know . i love you .
i love you , too .
we &apos;re holding them for questioning .
we haven &apos;t charged them yet .
yeah , well , either charge them or let them go .
maybe you haven &apos;t heard .
murder one , the execution of a robbery .
with weak and tangential evidence .
the jars of prescription pills
found in alexis &apos;s room had bar codes .
these bar codes link them to the colton &amp; lowell pharmacy ,
where andrew lightbox , a hardworking american citizen ,
was murdered at 11 : 00 last night .
which only goes to connect her , not him .
when the police subsequently searched jonathan murphy &apos;s room ,
they found more of the same .
searched ? did the police have a search warrant ?
hey , it &apos;s a reunion .
and , no , they didn &apos;t .
they are campus police .
they don &apos;t need a search warrant
to canvass any on @-@ campus dorm room .
yeah , that &apos;s right . get kalinda on it .
come on , cary . they id &apos;d
the drug dealer as one of bishop &apos;s crew .
yes .
all of these men are members of bishop &apos;s crew .
they also all happen to be dead .
nice sleight of hand , cary .
hey , i learned from the best .
so , here &apos;s the thing--
only one of your two clients pulled the trigger .
so i could charge them both ,
i could prosecute them both , but i have a deal for you .
burglary for the first one who turns on the other .
burglary , first offense-- eight months .
murder during the commission of a robbery-- 25 years .
yep .
first pie out of the oven .
so , the question is , who wants to get out of prison
in time for their 22nd birthday ?
and who wants to get out for their 48th ?
we play this out .
keep listening to cary .
keep him talking .
we don &apos;t say a word .
the right to remain silent
does not mean the right to not listen .
and we &apos;ll see what you can dig up .
we should phone blake , too .
we need to keep her on the reservation .
alexis ?
yes , alexis .
you and julius represent her .
alicia and i will take him .
cary &apos;s playing this like the prisoner dilemma .
one prisoner gets so paranoid the other will flip ,
they both race to flip .
but we keep in touch .
we don &apos;t get paranoid .
if we both remain silent ,
he has to make a case .
and he doesn &apos;t have one .
and murphy &apos;s son ?
what if he &apos;s the triggerman ?
well , i think you know who we need to protect here .
is alexis all right ?
she &apos;s fine .
we &apos;re going to represent both of you .
thank you .
thank you so much .
look , jon , your first instinct here
will be to lie to us .
your second instinct will be to lie to us , too .
so we need your third instinct .
we &apos;re not your confessors .
we &apos;re not here to judge .
we &apos;re your lawyers .
we just need the truth in order to know how to act .
so what happened ?
nothing .
it was stupid .
we heard about a place
where you could go get something to keep awake .
so we went .
for finals .
a lot of kids were doing it .
he &apos;s lying .
i don &apos;t know why .
i don &apos;t think they did it .
he might be trying to protect her .
and she &apos;s protecting him .
they &apos;re going to protect each other right into prison .
so how do you know you &apos;re gay ?
you mean before or after i fellated my first guy ?
i don &apos;t like that word .
i &apos;m sorry . before or after i fellated my first man ?
you don &apos;t have to answer if you don &apos;t want .
i knew from a very young age .
high school .
so you think you were born gay ?
do i think i was born gay ? yes , i do think .
what i don &apos;t understand
is why it &apos;s so important to say people were born gay .
if it &apos;s so good ,
people should be allowed to choose it , shouldn &apos;t they ?
they should think it wasn &apos;t forced on them .
they would just prefer it .
but it isn &apos;t about &quot; should ; &quot; it &apos;s about biology .
well , yes ... well , i don &apos;t think it is .
i think people want to think it is .
okay , my turn .
why do so many old people read reader &apos;s digest ?
the big type .
isn &apos;t this fun ?
we &apos;re sharing deep truths .
i saw grace holding hands with a girl from school .
oh ... my god .
you can make fun ,
but i think it &apos;s
too early for her to know if she &apos;s gay or not .
i &apos;m afraid she &apos;s making a choice that she &apos;ll regret .
regret ?
don &apos;t take it personally .
sure . why would i ?
look , they were holding hands , jackie .
girls hold hands .
in grace &apos;s room .
girls hold hands in rooms .
on her bed , after a sleepover .
let her through .
thanks .
i thought i &apos;d just see how you guys were ...
you don &apos;t have to tell a story , all right ?
we &apos;re here to show you everything .
the asa says you &apos;ll find it anyway .
okay , then , show me everything .
you need one of these to get into the library .
your client says they were in there at 11 : 00--
the time of the murder .
i think he said around 11 : 00 .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
there &apos;s a computer that keeps track
of everyone entering and exiting .
here &apos;s a copy for you .
i &apos;m guessing this is not going to end well .
well , it does for me .
last time your client was in the library was a week ago .
bye @-@ bye , alibi .
who &apos;s that ?
campus police .
getting older every year .
is he the one who found the pills ?
it was a legal search .
i &apos;m sure it was .
do you mind if i just have a chat with him ?
damn . i thought at least their alibi would hold up .
i &apos;m talking to the campus cop .
they &apos;re always good for an infraction or two .
mr. gardner ?
yes ?
i &apos;m eliza symanski , alexis &apos;s mother .
we &apos;re doing this pro bono , ma &apos;am-- free--
because we have a relationship with the murphy family .
it &apos;s serious , but we can &apos;t tell how much is police overreach .
overreach ?
are they overcharging ?
was it just a drug charge they &apos;re trying to inflate
to a murder ?
do you need some water , ma &apos;am ?
no , thank you .
she &apos;s a good girl .
she would never do anything like that .
that &apos;s good to know .
just know , mrs. symanski , we &apos;re on the case .
you could go with a public defender ,
but we will put all our resources into this .
i think i will take that water .
certainly .
at a certain point , you have to wonder if this is right .
tricking that woman into thinking you &apos;re on her side .
let me get this straight .
you &apos;re criticizing us for using tricks ?
i don &apos;t apologize for lying to two punk kids who killed a man .
two punk kids-- really ? have you looked at them ?
we &apos;ve both dealt with enough criminals
to know the killers look exactly like the victims .
so you have a master key ?
yep . all the campus cops do .
so when you entered jonathan &apos;s dorm room , you were looking for drugs ?
yes .
don &apos;t mind me . i &apos;ll just sit here .
other students reported prescription drugs being sold by mr. murphy .
sold , not used ?
yes .
congratulations , kalinda .
you just added a year to their sentence .
and where &apos;d you find the drugs ?
there , under the bed .
in there ?
can you show me how you found the drugs ?
sure .
yeah , i come in the room , i look around ,
i see the gym bag there .
i zip it open ,
saw the drugs .
you zipped open the gym bag ?
yeah .
why ?
search of the dorm room was legal ,
but the moment you unzipped mr. murphy &apos;s gym bag ,
the search became illegal .
better phone cary .
thanks a lot .
it &apos;s going to be a long night .
yeah , i got it .
1410 probation for the both of them .
it &apos;s a technicality .
you guys just love saying that .
the whole constitution is a technicality .
okay .
three months .
first one who flips gets three months .
cary , think about it . why would we do that ?
diane &apos;s in one room , i &apos;m in the other .
you lost .
don &apos;t let your ego do the thinking .
so they &apos;re not charging you ?
excuse me ?
the , uh , law firm ...
lockhart &amp; gardner , they &apos;re not charging you
for representing your daughter ?
yeah . why ?
did they tell you i have a deal on the table ?
if your daughter takes it ,
she gets three months probation as opposed to 25 years .
on the other hand ,
if their paying client takes the three months ,
your daughter gets 25 years .
so , that &apos;s a difficult position to be in-- representing both clients ,
especially when only one of them can benefit from a plea bargain .
i just want the best thing for my daughter .
i know ,
but they &apos;re trying to scare you
by saying it &apos;s them or a public defender ,
and there are respectable law firms out there
that do pro bono work .
so , i could give you a name if you want .
no .
yep . you &apos;ve just been fired .
by who ?
mrs. symanski .
i think it &apos;s for the best .
yeah , for the best ,
but thank you for all your hard , selfless work .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
eight months to the first one who flips .
good night .
owen , it &apos;s me .
you have my keys , remember ?
hello .
hello .
having fun , are we ?
i have had a drink , but i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m doing laundry .
okay .
what have you done to my mother ... ?
no , no , that ...
that is your perception .
well , you know , i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t help you with that .
oh , okay , yeah . no , believe him and not me .
that &apos;s fine .
that is great .
hey . how &apos;d your thing go ?
not well .
was that kevin ?
yeah . he told me to tell you hello .
i drank all your tequila .
when did you start drinking tequila , anyway ?
you should go to him .
to kevin ? no . why ?
he didn &apos;t cheat on you , did he ?
just go to him and say you &apos;re sorry .
yeah , well , what if i &apos;m not ?
lie and say that you are .
oh , come on , alicia .
we don &apos;t all have to be like you .
not everybody &apos;s required to be committed for life .
oh , really ?
the silent alicia treatment .
really ?
is that what we &apos;ve descended to already ?
not funny ! not funny !
no !
so , did you save the world ?
no . tomorrow .
oh , it &apos;s you .
anything from derrick ?
nope . rodney called .
what &apos;d he say ?
derrick is out , and he heard lockhart / gardner &apos;s breaking up .
you &apos;re serious ?
yeah , i &apos;m serious .
diane lockhart &apos;s been lining up clients for a coup .
i &apos;m going back to sleep now .
making little kitten noises .
that &apos;s blood , jon , on the floor of your car .
we &apos;re testing it now ,
and my guess is , it &apos;s going to come back
as the blood of mr. lightbox , the murdered pharmacist .
inadmissible , cary , and you know it .
fruit of the poisonous tree .
the only reason you searched the car
is because of an illegal search of our client &apos;s bag in their dorm room .
and yes , if this was strictly about court , that would be true .
but what you need to know
is that we &apos;re closing in on you two .
then come back to us when you &apos;ve closed in ,
because this melodrama is getting old .
we &apos;ll find the gun , alexis , then the deal goes away .
right now , it &apos;s eight months .
make it eight @-@ month probation and we &apos;ll talk .
then i &apos;ll just walk across the hall ,
and i &apos;ll make the same offer to your girlfriend .
then walk .
you wouldn &apos;t be here if they hadn &apos;t said the same thing .
okay ,
but it &apos;s your life your lawyers are gambling with , jon .
and here &apos;s ... here &apos;s one more thing you might consider :
my boss is glenn childs .
he &apos;s running for reelection .
and he &apos;s received a fairly large campaign contribution
from keith murphy , the father of your boyfriend .
now , who do you think my boss
would rather make a deal with ,
your or his campaign contributor ?
so , if i were you , i would jump at that ,
because how would that look to the electorate ?
glenn childs making a light plea offer
to one of his largest campaign contributors ?
are you listening ?
i &apos;m listening .
you don &apos;t understand .
alexis won &apos;t turn on me , and i won &apos;t turn on her .
are you sure about that ?
because i just came from him ,
and he has these high @-@ priced lawyers ,
and they seem to be wearing him down .
i don &apos;t believe you .
do you think love can conquer all ?
even a 25 @-@ year stretch ?
well , that &apos;s good .
jonathan &apos;s dad just flew in .
maybe he can talk to him .
what &apos;s kalinda doing ?
she &apos;s looking for the gun .
i need you to keep something confidential , alicia .
okay .
can you do that ?
i ... if you ask me to .
i &apos;ve come to respect you mightily as a lawyer .
thank you .
david lee , julius and i are starting our own firm .
we want you to come with us .
as you can imagine , this is very difficult .
i have genuine feelings for will ,
but he and bond are taking the firm
in a direction that leaves little room for me-- a woman .
does will know about this ?
that we &apos;re leaving ? no .
and i know you two have a close relationship .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m asking you-- whichever way you choose to go ,
you must keep this conversation confidential .
he &apos;s having his third instincts .
and here we come .
alexis has a friend .
jenni , uh , salerno .
someone from the neighborhood .
she phoned . she was in trouble .
she needed to be picked up , so ... so we drove her .
she had blood on her shirt and her shoes ,
and she had a gun .
did you touch the gun ?
yes .
we hoped to get rid of it .
okay , i need you to tell me exactly :
where did you get rid of it ?
hey , blake , we need you to locate a jenni salerno .
yeah .
with any luck , he tossed it in the water .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s been having much luck up until now .
where &apos;s you car ?
come on in .
yep , they &apos;re doing a quadrant search .
he said it was right up over here .
so what do we do ?
it &apos;s illegal to take it .
so we just leave it ?
hope maybe the police don &apos;t find it ?
it &apos;s not technically part of the crime scene .
the police haven &apos;t found any evidence yet .
and who &apos;s to say this gun was the gun ?
we took it into our possession .
we were in a crime @-@ ridden neighborhood .
we were worried someone would find the gun
before the police were contacted .
it &apos;s evidence .
we can &apos;t destroy , move , alter , conceal evidence .
so that &apos;s it , then .
yes .
pull over here .
why ?
a thought .
we &apos;re not selling .
no , we , uh ...
back by the rocks over there ,
we just found a gun .
we didn &apos;t know if it was one of yours . maybe not .
okay .
was that legal ?
that was on the line .
she said that ? she lying .
they also said that you wanted them to get rid of your gun
and that you sold them some prescription pills .
what ?
it was the opposite . i bought some of those pills from them .
answer the question !
thursday night , 11 : 00 p.m. , where were you ?
i was at a atm machine , okay ? !
geez ! i was getting out money !
empty your pockets .
surveillance photos of jenni at 11 : 10 p.m.
there &apos;s no way she would have gotten
from the murder scene to the atm machine .
so jonathan and alexis ,
they &apos;re lying .
they broke in , the two of them .
the pharmacist surprised them .
alexis saw him raising his gun to shoot jonathan ,
so she struggled with him and killed him .
later , they told jenni what happened .
alexis killed him to save jonathan .
so we need him to take the plea .
we need him to turn on her .
how are we going to do that ?
the one reason he hasn &apos;t turned on her yet : love .
you &apos;re going to break them up ?
no one said it would be pretty .
i have a question in my mind , they started pushing her hard ...
he &apos;s here .
mr. murphy .
where &apos;s my son ?
he &apos;s being questioned . i &apos;m will gardner .
we spoke on the phone .
all right , diane , what &apos;s going on ?
the state &apos;s attorney made an offer :
four months in trade for his testimony .
against her ?
yes . it looks like they burglarized the pharmacy together ,
but she was the one who shot the pharmacist .
um , maybe we should ...
how long has jonathan been dating alexis ?
dating ? half a year , maybe . why ?
the reason jonathan has refused
to take a plea is his concern for her .
we need him to rethink that concern .
what was your name again ?
will gardner .
do you have a plan for doing that ?
yes , but it would help if we had some ammunition .
he e @-@ mails regularly with my wife .
about a month ago , he told her he couldn &apos;t sleep .
he was ... he ...
he thought alexis was seeing another student .
did he give you a name ?
he overheard her talking to someone on the phone
named neil .
that &apos;s all i know .
that &apos;s enough . i &apos;ll get on it .
you think this is a mistake ?
i can &apos;t tell what &apos;s a mistake anymore .
he didn &apos;t do it .
yes , but she did it to save him .
damn . it &apos;s the kid with the gun .
hey , that &apos;s kind of fortuitous , huh ?
this kid just showed up with the murder weapon .
really ?
yeah .
turns out he &apos;s a sophomore at csc
and he just found the gun ,
called it in to the police .
that &apos;s a real good samaritan .
it &apos;s a good thing he pointed us towards the gun
because we never would have found it .
yeah , it &apos;s a good thing . yeah .
not only that , but we found prints on it .
the lab is expediting them , so we should know
in a couple hours who those prints belong to .
so , it &apos;s a good time to make that deal with us .
yeah , we &apos;ll get back to you .
do you really think he &apos;s going to hold out much longer ?
he &apos;s negotiating with us right now to get the plea down .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i love him , and he loves me .
well , i hope you &apos;re right ,
because i just found the murder weapon .
and my guess is ,
it has both your prints on it .
let me talk to her .
i know the lawyers over there , alexis .
i know how they work .
they &apos;re doing what i &apos;m going to do right now :
plead with you to take this deal .
i know you think love lasts forever .
it doesn &apos;t .
love wilts in the face of 25 years ,
and then it &apos;ll just be you and a prison cell .
listen to me , please .
here &apos;s your neil-- neil osiola .
she phoned him three times in one night ,
five times the following week .
good . great .
no , it &apos;s not what you think .
she &apos;s not cheating on him .
doesn &apos;t matter . we can leverage this .
no , i phoned him . he &apos;s her ob / gyn .
and she &apos;s phoning her ob / gyn &apos; cause she &apos;s pregnant .
look , she phoned him seven times--
three in one night .
neil osiola .
neil osiola there .
you see ?
that &apos;s the woman you &apos;re throwing away your future for .
that &apos;s the man she &apos;s been cheating with .
sorry i have to be tough .
people decide their future in a heartbeat ,
and they don &apos;t know how important that heartbeat is .
wilk &apos;s doing the same thing in his room .
i understand .
i just don &apos;t have to like it ,
but i understand .
do it , jon .
it &apos;s not right , dad .
no , what &apos;s not right is having your mom
visit you in prison for the next 25 years .
what &apos;s not right is throwing away your future .
i can &apos;t turn on her .
you can , son .
she did it .
she killed a man .
she killed a man to save me .
the only reason we were there was because of me .
and you won &apos;t walk away from that .
you &apos;ll be sentenced for burglary .
you &apos;ll have a record .
dad , i love her .
do you love me ?
then , please ...
do this .
get him in here .
cary . cary .
have you made a decision ?
i want to confess .
no !
no !
alexis !
alexis , it &apos;s okay !
no !
let me out !
let me out ! let me out !
hold on .
let me out !
let me out ! let me out , please !
please . why ?
why did you do it ?
we &apos;re having a baby .
i can &apos;t have you inside .
no !
look , you did this to protect me .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing this .
no .
no .
no !
no ! no !
i understand .
now i do .
thank you .
that was murphy ?
yes .
he wants another firm to handle his son &apos;s appeal .
he wants to take his business elsewhere .
and he &apos;s going with you ?
with me ?
to your new firm .
you want to have this out now ?
we &apos;re both here .
who told you ? alicia ?
no . she didn &apos;t tell me .
in fact , i didn &apos;t even know she already knew .
i &apos;ve asked her to join me .
and she &apos;s considering it ?
i think so .
who else ?
why , so you can weed out the betrayers ?
you should have told me , diane .
if i was considering this ,
i would have told you .
are you serious ?
you and bond have been plotting for months ...
oh , my god , you &apos;re paranoid .
and i &apos;m right .
tell me i &apos;m not right .
no ,
you know what ? i &apos;m through telling you .
we have not made one single move against you , diane .
not one .
you said you never knew blake .
kalinda found out--
you and blake go back for years .
and you and bond have been systematically
turning the equity partners against me .
you are only happy when you think
people are lined up against you .
so have it .
happy birthday .
it &apos;s my present to you .
gorge on your own paranoia , but don &apos;t come in tomorrow .
this is my firm , as well .
no , it isn &apos;t !
and tomorrow ,
i &apos;m going to have guards outside your office doors ,
and i &apos;m gathering the equity partners .
to vote me out .
tell me my concerns weren &apos;t real .
you made your concerns real .
i &apos;m in here .
you &apos;re up late .
yeah .
i &apos;m eating halloween candy .
do you want some ?
no . i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m never going to find love .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m hard to live with .
i get sick of people .
they get on my nerves .
you called kevin .
i did .
i apologized .
i was very convincing .
i even ... convinced myself .
but he said it &apos;s over .
oh , owen .
it &apos;s all right .
scary thing is that i felt relieved .
i don &apos;t know .
love just doesn &apos;t seem to last very long for me .
they should put you in a museum .
thanks .
no . it &apos;s not , um ...
no , it &apos;s just this ability you have .
how ... how do you make love outlast passion ?
is that what i do ?
i don &apos;t know . you tell me .
i think it &apos;s not just about the heart , owen .
i think , sometimes , the heart needs ... steering .
i thought you were going to say something profound .
what was wrong with that ?
&quot; the heart needs ... steering . &quot;
it &apos;s late .
i &apos;m going to stay here for a couple of days .
okay .
i mean , you can say no .
can i ?
no .
okay .
so , owen , why don &apos;t you stay here for a few days ?
if you insist .
will you make cooing sounds
