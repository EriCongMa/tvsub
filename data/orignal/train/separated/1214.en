Wait.
We're all in this together,
That could be "A" or it could be Alison.
Has anyone talked to Ali?
She calls, but I don't pick up.
You guys, I had a bad thought.
What's this one?
Ali left town, but "A" Said she couldn't.
What changed?
I enrolled at the Harrisburg Police Academy.
You can't just become a policeman.
Why not?
Paige, we need to talk.
Yeah, we should talk.
Tanner thinks we killed Bethany Young.
Spencer, I don't think the police
believe a thing that Ali is saying.
She was a stranger and I buried her alive,
because I thought I was protecting you.
Melissa killed Bethany Young.
She thought that she just buried her.
She thought that I killed her.
I'm not talking to Tanner.
Neither am I.
I didn't think it was you.
Oh, my God.
Alison.
When she finishes with me,
she'll come after you and the others.
She can't trust you anymore.
I'll take your statement now, one at a time.
Hanna, let's head over to the porch.
You can walk me through this.
No.
No, I-I-I can't go back up there.
I don't want to see that again.
You saw all the blood in there.
There's no way anyone could have lived through that.
"It's all your fault. A."
We're going to ask you several questions that we know are true.
Then I will ask you questions that we don't know.
Your body's responses will indicate
whether you're being honest with us or not.
Maybe we should wait for Tanner.
When you tell the truth, you use your memory.
When you lie, you're using your imagination.
The sensors will detect that change.
Do you understand how it works?
Answer verbally.
I understand.
So we'll begin.
Are you sitting down?
Yes.
What color is your shirt?
White with pink flowers.
State your legal name.
Alison Lauren DiLaurentis.
Come in.
You've got company.
Who is it?
Come see for yourself.
Why the grim faces.
Did somebody die?
Mona, we need your help.
What did she do to you?
Nothing...
yet.
It's what we think she's about to do.
We just found out that Ali's at the police station.
She's talking to the cops.
And you don't know what she's telling them.
A lie gets halfway around the world
before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.
Did Ali say that?
No. Churchill did.
Churchill did.
Look, we've been lying for Ali ever since she got back.
We need to know what story she's telling the cops.
So why not ask her?
Because we don't believe she'll tell us the truth.
And why do you think that I can help you?
Because you're Mona.
Who else was in the barn that night?
Aria Montgomery.
Hanna Marin.
And Emily Fields.
When you left the barn, were they all still sleeping?
Yes.
Where did you last see Spencer Hastings?
Alison stole my life from me
when she crowned me Rosewood's biggest loser.
And she was so convincing, even I started to believe her.
So that means you'll help us?
Look, I know I owe you guys for everything I've done to you.
But I'm already number one on her hit list.
If Alison finds out I'm siding with you guys,
I'm afraid to think of how far she'd go to stop me.
Are you really that scared of her?
Aren't you?
Isn't that why you're here?
I don't mean to interrupt your girl-talk,
but I wanted to bring these out while they're still warm.
Hanna, is chocolate chip still your favorite?
So nice of you.
But we have to go.
I'll send some home with you.
I'll be right back.
Have you ever been so focused on something
that it takes over everything else?
Turns you into someone that you're not?
I took all of my Ali-anger out on you guys and...
I'm sorry for that.
Han.
I'm waiting for the cookies.
Did you figure out what you're gonna do
with your sister's going-away present?
Melissa sent me that video
because she wanted me to know the truth.
Her confession doesn't actually help any of us.
She said it out loud.
She buried Bethany.
She killed her.
Yeah, because she thought that I was the one who hit her.
But you didn't.
We all know that, Spence.
It doesn't matter.
In Melissa's story I'm an accessory to murder.
That's best case scenario.
Here you go.
Thank you, Mrs. V.
And they are still my favorite.
See you at school?
Yeah.
Well, it was nice to see you.
Hanna...
I need to ask.
Now that she's back...
Alison, is it starting again?
I'm not friends with Alison anymore.
So I don't really don't know what she's doing.
But I do think that Mona's afraid of her.
We all are.
Send out a code "A."
She's plotting something big.
Lock the door. I think somebody is following me.
Where is everybody?
They're not coming.
Why?
Alison got to them.
They're convinced that she's the saint
and you're "Crazy Mona."
That's what they're calling you now.
Do you think you can be crazy and not know it?
If you start to believe that, she wins.
I'm talking about Alison.
I think she's gone full-on socio.
Alison volunteered to take the polygraph.
How do you know that?
She's Mona.
After you left last night, I did some recon.
Alison would never put herself at risk
unless she believed her story.
Well, if you believe a lie, it becomes a truth.
And why lie to yourself unless...
You did something so bad
you don't want to believe that you did it.
Or you're playing a game.
You think that Ali took the lie detector test for fun?
I think she took it because she's not having fun anymore.
She can't play with her dolls if you won't let her.
This is how she's ending the game.
What game?
The game.
The one she stole from me.
You think that Alison's "A"?
I'm not the only one having bad thoughts.
She assembled the perfect group.
Smart, loyal,
admiring and compassionate.
Perfect group for what?
For a sociopath to manipulate.
Alison would have gotten bored with any one of you.
But all together...
We're a challenge.
I never understood why Alison chose me,
what made me so special.
When you don't feel anything,
it must be really fun to mess with somebody who feels a lot.
Alison picked you because you care.
And she can't.
So are we really saying that Alison's "A" out loud?
She never loved me.
She never loved any of us.
Guys, if Mona's right,
if Ali is ending the game because we cut her off,
then she went to the cops to convince them
that she's innocent and we're the guilty ones.
Guilty of what?
Everything.
Look, I can find out what she told the cops.
Maybe it'll give you guys a fighting chance
to get your stories straight.
Mona, why are you helping us?
I got early acceptance letters from three colleges,
but I still have to survive senior year.
And I can't do it alone.
We need your help, Mona,
but this doesn't suddenly make us besties.
I don't want to hold your hand in the hallways, Emily.
No one can know that I'm doing this
or the deal is off.
And that includes your bed-buddies.
Okay?
So do whatever you were going to do today.
Just act normal.
Hey, Toodles.
Happy almost-Turkey Day.
Thanks.
You ready for Thanksgiving?
Uh, not really, no.
Because we usually decorate early for Christmas
and this year, I'm totally behind.
If you need any help...
How was your night, the one you got all dressed up for?
It was a costume thing.
Mine didn't really fit.
We never had our talk.
I'm tired of talking.
Mom?
What are you doing here?
I was just in the cafeteria
dropping off the food for the holiday drive.
You forgot to bring the bag this morning.
Sorry, my brain's already on Thanksgiving break.
It's no big deal.
Don't be late for class, honey.
I'll see you tonight.
Yeah.
Alison DiLaurentis,
please report to Principal Hackett's office.
Alison DiLaurentis,
please report to the principal.
You got pumpkin guts on your face.
Come here.
Thank you.
You know, we can just go to Paula's and buy the pies.
No, this is my grandmother's recipe.
This is way better than Paula's.
Granny Rose uses Libby's canned pie mix
and puts it in a frozen shell,
but Montgomerys will never know the difference.
Well, this is the first time the Montgomerys
have invited me over for Thanksgiving.
And your mother assigned me to the pie duty.
So I'm not taking it lightly.
Well, just so you know,
they're not gonna have enough time to judge your baking.
They'll be too busy judging you.
Well, that's why you're invited.
They know that we're spending a lot of time together,
so they just want to make sure
that you're worth a second look.
I'm suddenly feeling like a used car.
Are they going to kick my tires and check under my hood?
Well, if Aunt Sarah gets drunk,
she might check under your hood.
And Uncle Danny will ask you to arm wrestle.
Just say no.
You're gonna love granny, though.
You can get past the long chin hairs.
You won't mind that she toots a lot.
I'm joking.
Granny plucks her chin hairs.
Put your hands behind your head and turn around.
I said put your hands behind your head.
I'm sorry, Officer,
I have a difficult time with authority.
If you want me to put my hands behind my head,
you're gonna have to come over here and make me.
Are you looking for trouble?
No, sir.
I'm a good girl, honest.
I just have a lot of really bad habits.
Oh, yeah.
They taught us how to deal
with delinquents like you in the Academy.
Why don't you show me what you learned?
That is some cop scholl.
You'll see it tonight.
The ceremony starts at 8:00,
but I think we should leave the Brew by 7:00.
I'll be on time, I promise.
Happy graduation.
Open it.
Go ahead, open it.
Spence.
I love you.
Sorry to bother you.
Is this where I apply
for the high school liaison program?
Oh, yeah.
Have a seat.
I'll get you pplication
Em, when Mona said act normal,
I don't think she meant we had to decorate your house.
This is the one thing I do every year
for me and my family.
I'm not gonna let Ali take that away from me.
Eggnog?
No, thanks.
If you can't find Christmas in your heart, Hanna,
you're not gonna find it under a tree.
Hey, Em, is this right?
A little more to the right.
No, my right, not Snowey's right.
Snowey?
Yeah, I named him when I was three.
And this is Pingey and Wingey.
Which one did you touch?
All of them, I don't know.
Oh, try one of the red ones.
They always go out.
Told you.
Now let's deck the halls and fa la la la la.
What is wrong with her?
Read her boobs.
The girl loves Christmas.
Where's Jesus?
He's up here.
It's my mom.
You guys really go all out.
My dad always finds a way to come home for Christmas.
It's after Thanksgiving dinner my mom and I come outside,
turn on the lights
and we know it won't be long until we see him.
Well, now I know why you love Christmas.
Uh, how's everything at home?
Good.
She just needs cranberries.
They were on the list.
They should be in the fridge.
Yeah, I know, but my grandma likes the canned kind.
You know, the ones that you slice.
I thought your grandma always made that salad
with the cranberries and the marshmallows in it.
Or not.
Hey, Em, can you grab a staple gun and give me a hand?
Okay, what was that?
What was what?
Hanna, I know when you're lying to me.
Who else was in the barn that night?
Aria Montgomery.
Hanna Marin.
And Emily Fields.
When you left the barn,
they were all still sleeping?
Yes.
Where did you last see Spencer Hastings?
She came to my house.
You were the leader of the group, right?
Unofficially.
And your friends would have done anything to help you?
If you needed them?
I think so.
Was Spencer a loyal friend?
As far as I knew.
Why was she at your house?
It was my fault.
I pushed her to that place.
What place?
She was angry.
Did you know Spencer was abusing amphetamines?
I found out that night.
Because she was under the influence?
She dropped her pills.
I saw what they were.
Would you say she was desperate?
For what?
For you to keep her secret?
She was emotional.
But I promised her I wouldn't say anything.
And in return for your silence,
what was she willing to do?
I wouldn't know.
We never discussed it again.
Is there something else you'd like to tell me?
I didn't have anything to do with Bethany Young's murder.
Do you play?
Sorry?
The piano?
I loved it as a kid, but I lost interest.
I can't remember why.
I shouldn't be here without Lieutenant Tanner,
but I just wanted to tell you this in person.
What is it?
Nothing Ali said was really that incriminating.
I think the questions they're asking
tell us more about their investigation
than her answers do.
How so?
Was Spencer a loyal friend?
Was she desperate?
Desperate enough to do what?
Kill Bethany.
Caleb, you are supposed to keep that secret.
Mona came to me.
I knew you'd tell him, so I asked for his help.
Are there any other helpers coming?
No, I didn't tell my bed-buddy.
Neither did I.
I'm sorry.
But could you lie to that face?
I unlocked two more files.
Your software slays by the way.
Is that decoding program military?
You don't want to know.
The cops were granted access
to Bethany's Radley files yesterday.
I can't open that link,
but I did find this affidavit
that Holbrook sent to the DA today.
"We no longer consider Alison DiLaurentis
a person of interest in Young's murder investigation."
So she's totally off the hook?
Yeah, and Spencer's on it.
"The information we obtained
from Bethany Young's hospital records
inform the theory we've been working since day one.
Spencer Hastings murdered Young to gain favor
with the group's leader, Alison."
But why would killing Bethany score points with Ali?
She told them she knew that I was taking the pills.
So they think that I would have done anything
to make her keep it a secret.
Yeah, but why would they think that she wanted Bethany dead?
You said he sent this to the DA?
Guys, I know how this works.
They submit an affidavit
so they can issue an arrest warrant.
Can you please call Toby?
I have to find my parents.
Before you do that,
don't you want to know what the cops know?
That affidavit was sent the day
after they saw Bethany's Radley files.
There has to be something in those files
that linked Ali to Bethany.
Let's find out what that is.
You guys, this is on me.
You don't have to do anything else.
Come on, Spence.
We're gonna stick together.
Yeah, because that's what we do.
Let's go back to Radley.
Together.
Are you in?
We're in.
Code "Go."
I repeat, code "Go."
Good night.
Emily hasn't checked in.
You better make sure that's not from "A."
You mean Alison.
It's Toby.
I should have told him what we were doing.
Not to poke where I don't belong,
but if I were graduating from po-po school,
I wouldn't want to know that my girlfriend
just broke into Radley.
I have to make it to that ceremony.
Then let's stop chatting and HTHU.
We're in the east corridor hall approaching the security door.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Just a scratchy throat.
But I was just about to crawl into bed, so...
I will.
Thanks, Paige.
Emily.
I didn't mean to scare you.
No, you didn't.
I seriously saw the hair rise on the back of your neck
when you heard my voice.
I was surprised to get your message.
You made your feelings for me
crystal the last time I saw you.
Sorry, my mom is at the store.
Last minute shopping.
在我身边 好讨厌
Why am I here, Emily?
It bothers me.
I mean tomorrow's Thanksgiving and you and I aren't speaking.
I wasn't that surprised when the others turned on me.
You were the one I really trusted.
The loyal one.
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
Ali, wait.
I don't want things to be like this.
Neither do I.
Wow, that's beautiful, Sandy.
I love the colors that you chose.
I'm so sorry.
This was totally all my fault.
Yeah, my middle name should have been Klutz.
Thank you.
And can you believe
I actually wanted to be a dancer growing up?
But then I realized I was on the shorter side,
so career crisis averted.
Hey, I'm sorry.
We've got company.
H, use your codes please.
Seriously?
Okay, red-light. Do you hear me?
We're in.
I said red-light as in the cherry on top of a cop car.
You've made quite a mess of things.
I didn't know you worked here, Aria.
It's not a job.
I volunteer.
It's admirable.
Okay, well, I should probably get back to the patients.
They might need more supplies.
Yeah, of course.
I'm just curious.
When did it all start?
What?
The lies.
The cover-ups.
The murders.
Your volunteer program.
A few weeks ago.
Do you have an interest in the mental health profession?
Well, I love art, I love helping people.
And did you volunteer before
or after the police identified Bethany's body?
Okay, you don't sound just curious anymore.
Should I call my parents?
No. Not yet.
One last thing.
Was your volunteer work Spencer's idea?
No.
Em, is me.
I mean, "H."
Is she still there?
Because Holbrook's here and it's getting weird.
What is this?
That?
Stop stalling.
Well, obviously it's a list of colleges.
Right, but this is a list of schools
that normally brainiacs go to.
Yeah, so?
You know that test they make you take?
The SCT?
You mean the SAT?
I don't remember which one it was.
But apparently I did kind of good on it.
Well, how good is kind of good?
Good enough that the guidance counselor called me in for cheating.
But I didn't cheat.
There's no way they're going to let you be friends with me.
If that's what you want.
I make my own decisions.
It's not a group vote.
I've had the chills all day.
Do you have any tea?
Chamomile?
Your mom never shops at the last minute.
You've got a text from Hanna.
She wants to know if you're still keeping me busy.
I'm "A," right?
I don't know.
Are you?
I actually believed you.
It must hurt when the loyal one betrays you.
That was quite a performance, Em.
Bravo.
It looks like they recorded every one of Bethany's sessions.
So what are your choices?
Yale, Harvard, and Dartmouth.
You got early acceptance from all three?
Brown, too,
but they're not offering me a full ride, so I'm passing.
How about you?
I haven't heard from anyone yet.
Well, if there's anything I can do to help...
I think you've done enough.
Wait, are we stealing this stuff?
We're borrowing it.
Wait.
See if there is a tape for August 8th?
I thought she really liked me.
But everything she ever said to me was a lie.
Who is she talking about?
Every word.
Every visit.
Mrs. DiLaurentis.
She was having an affair with Bethany's father.
I wonder if I can trust anyone in that family.
Is it like mother, like daughter?
Oh, my God.
Did Alison know Bethany?
Spencer, it's me.
I can't wait any longer, so I'm gonna head out.
Call me.
We need to find another way out of here.
Use the back staircase.
We can trip the emergency exit.
What's Holbrook doing here?
Asking questions about Spencer.
Toby, hi.
Spencer, where are you?
I was worried about you.
Wait, I can't hear you.
Hello?
Spencer?
Spencer?
I can't hear you .
Toby!
I can't believe they make you work on Thanksgiving.
I get off at noon.
People still need their fix.
Thanks.
Spencer, it's not your fault.
Were you at the hospital all night?
Yeah.
He's going to be fine. You said so yourself.
He's gonna be in that cast for about a month.
How much does he know?
Everything.
Emily, I have to talk to you.
Paige, I'm sorry, now is not a good time.
I brought you some soup last night
because you said you weren't feeling well.
Yeah, and I lied because...
Explain it to me later.
I saw Alison leaving.
Cindy and Mindy were her ride.
They drove her out to this abandoned farm.
There had to have been at least a dozen cars out there.
Guys, Ali is building an army of her own.
Spencer Hastings, you're under arrest
for the murder of Bethany Young.
No. I-I-I didn't do this.
...will be admissible in a court of law.
She didn't do anything! - She can't do anything!
Guys!
Spencer!
Toby.
I'll call your parents.
We'll get you out.
I thought she really liked me.
But everything she ever said to me was a lie.
Mona?
I'll be right down.
And did I tell you Lesli's gonna be there?
No way. I talked to her last night.
She said she was stuck at school.
Pretend I didn't just ruin the surprise.
Promise me you'll get on the road within the hour.
I don't want you to get stuck in traffic.
Okay, I will.
I just have to finish this report
and then I'm on my way.
I know we don't need these.
But I figured someone might get hungry.
My mom's still on the phone with Veronica.
They haven't seen her yet.
Spencer's still getting processed.
Look, I'm sure that the Hastings are working on her bail.
They'll get her out of there in no time, Aria.
It's Mona.
Hello.
Alison lured Bethany to Rosewood.
What? Why?
She knew about the affair.
Alison set her up.
She was jealous and she wanted Bethany dead.
Aria, Alison is "A"
and now I can prove it.
Grab your coat.
Where are we going?
To Mona's. She found proof.
Ali's "A."
Game over, Alison.
I win.
Mom?
Mona?
What the hell?
Oh, my God.
Mona!
Call 911.
Oh my God!
Hurry!
The investigation is ongoing,
but we have ruled this a homicide.
Although we did not find a body,
the amount of blood in the house would indicate
that the victim's wounds were fatal.
Mona Vanderwaal was murdered.
No, no, no.
