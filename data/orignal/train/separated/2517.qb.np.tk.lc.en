no sex without a ring .

矮人与爱尔兰人不得入内
what the ... ? !
what about us , man ?
get your own couch .
poor chip . such a big part of everyone &apos;s life .
people called him the &quot; sixth simpson . &quot;
i &apos;m not sure why .
chip did such a wonderful job with my biography .
奇普 · 戴维斯著
chip was the life of sector 6 @-@ f at the nuclear plant ,
but chip once confessed to me he did have a few regrets .
chip regretted never ascending
mount springfield from the south face .
he regretted that the high school long jump record he set
was wind @-@ aided .
he often spoke of that asterisk .
he never broke par on hole 17
at springfield mini golf .
let us pray .
eh , everyone has regrets .
not me .
you ? your marriage is a dead fish
floating in a tank of stale beer .
your baby &apos;s addicted to pacifiers .
and your son is out of control .
let us kneel .
ow ! my knees !
40 years of healing , gone !
he &apos;s such a little dickens .
although dickens was pretty well behaved .
he &apos;s been screwed up since the moment homer &apos;s dna
staggered into your womb .
i have no regrets about that .
it was a perfect pregnancy .
didn &apos;t smoke , didn &apos;t drink , lost three pounds .
and every night before bed ,
homer would give me a little kiss ...
music !
could bart have been prenatally screwed up
by the kiss music ?
* get up ! everybody &apos;s gonna move their feet . *
* get down ! everybody &apos;s gonna leave their seats . *
* you got to lose your mind in detroit rock city . *
man , this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever .
well , for some reason it relaxes me .
now , do that thing gene simmons does .
overstay my welcome for 40 years ?
regrets , eh ? this local newsman &apos;s had a few .
covering a town of backwater rubes
who , for some reason , hate my guts .
this is kent brockman ...
live at the springfield peach parade .
总指挥福兹 · 佐勒尔
sir , could you give us eight seconds of your homespun wisdom ?
it &apos;s a little @-@ known fact that you can get head lice from peaches .
uh , this is my daughter peaches .
we &apos;ll have more regrets at 11 : 00 tonight
following an all @-@ new bottle of scotch .
you have regrets ,
mr. &quot; i get to see the weathergirl from the side &quot; !
i made the worst financial decision of all time .
oh , i can &apos;t think about it .
i won &apos;t think about it .
i don &apos;t want to think about it !
oh , i &apos;m thinking about it !
2001年初
oh ... that &apos;s the coolest bowling ball
i &apos;ve ever seen .
hello , bear stearns ?
i &apos;d like to sell all my apple stock
so i can buy a fancy bowling ball .
you heard me . technology is a fad .
heavy , blue balls are the future .
now let us text on our ubiquitous apple tablets and phones .
oh , you cost me a piece of all that !
oh , don &apos;t cry .
if it makes you feel worse ,
i &apos;m the man who bought the stock you sold .
i &apos;ll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all .
just one .
the girl that got away .
she broke my first heart .
so , is there truly anyone among us without regrets ?
i have no regrets .
really , mother ?
oh , i didn &apos;t see you there .
i &apos;m father o &apos;greedy .
dimes for the needy .
milhouse , are you the bottom half of that mischief ?
oh , my .
my pants , like the lord , work in mysterious ways .
return those vestments .
speaking of return on investments ,
my apple stock is up 3,500 % .
aw , you misheard that on purpose !
tithe denied ! tithe denied !
mm . must find way ... to blame myself .
um , it says i should give you lumbar support .
better go to the lumber yard .
&quot; lum- bar . &quot; it means &quot; lower back . &quot;
how many times will you make that mistake ?
just put on the kiss record .
which one ?
anything from love gun .
hey , book , are you expecting this ?
and while i &apos;m at it ...
burn , dumb , helpful books .
that is a good fire .
you &apos;re going down , bart !
ah , reckless youth .
he &apos;ll be okay .
i was referring to him .
i had a spring in my step like that once .
back when i met lilah .
lilah ran a little crepe stand in the seventh arrondissement .
oh , monty ,
looking at you ,
i could lie in this unheated garret forever .
there &apos;s heat . i just don &apos;t turn it on .
seeing you there , in the sweet light of paris between the wars ,
there &apos;s a question i must pose .
i have something for you .
oh ! not that .
wrong box . lilah , will you take that big step
from cousin to wife ?
oh , monty , you must promise me one thing .
anything she wanted i was willing to do .
anything , except ...
all i ask is that you set aside
five minutes a day to think of others .
when you say &quot; others , &quot; could they be bars of gold ?
i shall find another husband
as good as you are evil .
no one &apos;s that good .
all i have left is my drawing .
hm . it looked a lot better in my memory .
uh , but you know what , smithers ?
i will find lilah and win her back .
i &apos;ll just check with the old gang .
hemingway !
picasso .
matador juan belmonte .
and stalin .
that man could really put pressure on you .
hello , kent .
well , well , well . rachel maddow .
everyone came back for chip &apos;s funeral .
i was flying from dc to new york and , of course ,
i had the layover in springfield .
how &apos;s the gang at channel 6 ?
look , let &apos;s get this out of the way-- just because we both
worked at channel 6 and you made it big and i didn &apos;t
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m bitter .
um , is that your car ?
maybe .
kent , i &apos;m gonna tell you
the most important mistake you ever made ...
after this break .
so , kent , that mistake you made ,
that fundamental , life @-@ changing error ,
that cosmic fail , that ...
just tell me already !
after this break .
you could have come with me ,
but you were suckling the dual teats
of infotainment and celebrifawning .
布罗克曼和玛多
so , tell us about your new movie .
it &apos;s fantastic .
《 溃烂尸骨4 : 冲击 》 主演
the studio let us play in their sandbox .
great . we have a clip .
no ! no , don &apos;t show it .
there aren &apos;t five good seconds in the whole film .
i &apos;m not a newsman anymore , i &apos;m a geologist .
i keep discovering a new rock bottom .
kent , i think i found my ticket out of this town .
or at least to a better springfield .
you two newshounds working on a story ?
how about this ?
mario &apos;s down the street
found a rat in their pasta .
when did that happen ?
whenever you want . eh ?
rachel , can i come ?
we can share blazers .
just follow me .
at mario &apos;s , the picture of sinatra on the wall
is signed by frank junior .
the frame hides the &quot; junior &quot; !
someone &apos;s been dumping tires in the forest .
willikers ! in my three years of soft news ,
i &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
those are tires from my ill @-@ fated krusty town car .
it would explode if people gripped the wheel too tightly .
what a scoop !
you &apos;re not telling no one .
as the 4 : 00 p.m. clown , i have complete control
of the channel 6 news division .
local news is a joke .
i &apos;m going to cable .
cable news !
bah ! people only want news at 6 : 00 p.m.
from white guys on weekdays ,
and black guys on weekends .
we &apos;ll see about that .
yes , we shall see .
about that , things will be seen .
by us .
kent , you coming ?
he ain &apos;t comin &apos; .
this little piggy &apos;s afraid to leave his cushy
anchorman slop trough .
could you , uh , phrase that a little more nicely ?
sorry . he &quot; isn &apos;t &quot; coming .
you &apos;ll regret this , kent .
when i have my own show and you &apos;re stuck here
tracking santa &apos;s flight from the north pole .
&quot; oh , look , he &apos;s over greenland ! &quot;
don &apos;t worry , piggy , you made the right choice .
eh , it &apos;ll burn out in an hour or so .
look , burns , i &apos;ve got the dope on your sweetie .
she &apos;s still alive , and she just got over
being mad at you last week .
lilah &apos;s alive ?
yeah , well , uh , she &apos;s alive ,
but she &apos;s a nun .
married to jesus , eh ? does he beat her ?
jesus ? no , he &apos;s a real eagle scout , that one .
but your penguin &apos;s not a catholic , she &apos;s a buddhist nun--
spent her life expressing her sexuality with a zen garden .
those raked rocks could have been me .
now , since you &apos;re so good at finding things , find the exit .
there is the little matter of my fee .
you &apos;re becoming very tiresome .
who moved my desk ? !
well , here i am . cable news alley .

deleting all contact information .

oh . okay , bart , be cool .
calm down , you &apos;re not gonna die up here .
家庭聚会
oh , monty , i can &apos;t believe you found me
after all these years .
i &apos;ve saved myself for you .
well , then , uh ...
i should disrobe at once .
housekeeping ? send up a chinese dressing screen
and one of firestone &apos;s finest vulcanized prophylactics .

smithers ? which do i take first ,
the rhino horn or the tiger tongue ?
i have my doubts about both , sir .
bah ! i &apos;ll just do it the old @-@ fashioned way .
with my pump .
just powdering my nose , darling .
smithers , run down to sears , roebuck
and get a five @-@ eighths @-@ inch phillips head bolt .
here i am , slowly dying every day
at five , six and eleven .
help ! help !
child in danger with exciting visuals !
this kid &apos;s corpse could be my magic carpet .
get me a cameraman !
the movie up has come horribly to life over springfield .
a local boy clings to life in a story
我尖叫 我漂浮
that proves this reporter &apos;s relevance .
ay , caramba !
it &apos;s bart !
pray for a miracle , boy .
god can hear you better from up there .
dear lord , please help me land safely .
or transform this basket into a flying killer robot
that i control with my mind . amen .
that &apos;s not a prayer .
my god says it is .
oh , i see you &apos;re ice @-@ cold with anticipation .
dead ?
oh , lilah .
even at the end , i waited too long .
what if i give her the breath of life ?
oh , boy .
i guess one regret just leads to another .
you know , sir , maybe it would bring you peace
to honor the one thing lilah ever asked of you .
here you are , my good man .
a little broth will cure your mental illness .
sir , that &apos;s five minutes .
you can stop thinking of other people now .
you know what , i think i &apos;ll give it another five .
i &apos;m proud of you , monty .
i ain &apos;t eatin &apos; that .
chief , what are you doing to save our son ?
well , i &apos;ve placed marksmen on the roof
to shoot the balloons one by one ,
but frankly they &apos;re not very good .
chief , it happened again .
aw , come on , guys , spread out . arm &apos;s length .
it &apos;s all my fault .
i should never have listened
to those kiss albums when i was pregnant .
marge , with all due respect , that &apos;s ridiculous .
my sarah listened to mozart and churchill speeches
when she was pregnant with ralphie ,
and he can &apos;t even open a refrigerator .
pushing , always ... always pushing .
really ?
oh , yeah . that kid &apos;s a mess .
hey ! only i get to criticize him , lou .
kid &apos;s scared to flush . think &apos;s it &apos;s his brother .
can we focus on my son up in the sky ?
oh , i &apos;ve got a long @-@ shot idea .
by which i mean firing a shot over a long distance .
yeah , you see , if we could fire
an exactly 12 @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ pound weight into the basket ,
it would lower the boy very gently to the ground .
unfortunately , all our cannonballs were melted down
to make a statue of joe paterno ,
which we changed to look like eugene levy .
i think i just might have what you &apos;re looking for .
today i &apos;m glad that i sold that stock .
uh , apple closed up another 20 points today .
why does everyone know ?
because their terrific products keep track of it for you .
and anything else you could ever think of .
that kid &apos;s not dying on my watch .
which ends ... right now , fortunately .
bart ! bart ! bart ! bart ! bart ! bart !
bart ! bart ! hmm .
homer &apos;s rising faster than apple stock .

my boy &apos;s okay !
bart ! bart ! bart !
i won the science fair !
i get to go to chicago !
bart ! bart ! bart !
ugh . bart , bart , bart.
you know what i think about regrets ?
as long as your family is together ,
every choice you &apos;ve ever made is the right one .
and together we are .
would you guys knock it off ? he &apos;s down safe already .
sorry , chief , that was me putting it down .
and there you have it-- a family reunited .
and a grateful nation gives thanks for some solid reporting .
back to you , rachel maddow .
great job , kent . i think we might have
an opening for you at msnbc
between our weekend prison documentary block
and the two hours it takes
to make up joe scarborough on monday morning .
no , thanks , rachel maddow . i &apos;m happy right here .
no regrets .
