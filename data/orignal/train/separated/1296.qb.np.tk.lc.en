hi .
falling in love at the first sight .
immediate attraction is pure narcissism .
oh , i don &apos;t agree .
look , they &apos;re talking about his t @-@ shirt .
it takes quite a lot of effort to attract a mate .
that right there is the beginning of true love .
people are attracted to people who are attracted to them .
well , there goes that theory .
something tells me we &apos;re not getting in much of a run .
rizzoli .
isles .
hey , russ . what do we got ?
hey , rizzoli . how you doing ?
got a floater .
when did you pull him out ?
20 minutes ago .
how long &apos;s he been in ?
well , it &apos;s hard to tell
once the body &apos;s been in the water for over an hour .
couldn &apos;t find an i.d.
we don &apos;t need an i.d.
maura ... you know him ?
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s adam fairfield .
i was , uh , i was involved with his brother garrett .
of the fairfields ?
was it serious ?
i was 20 .
everything felt serious .
look at the back of his head .
yeah , it &apos;s common with drowning victims .
most likely from getting struck against the rocks .
you want to go with me when i notify the family ?
no .
but i will .
i owe him that .
holy crap .
well ...
the castle in scotland is much bigger .
place on the cape is beautiful , too .
you could &apos;ve been a fairfield .
how do we not know this ?
could you stop saying that ?
whoo @-@ whoo !
this is a spyker !
c8 laviolette .
that &apos;s 400 horses up under there .
i &apos;ve only seen these in magazines .
garrett &apos;s here . he &apos;s always liked the finer things in life .
yeah . he liked you .
i should have known .
somebody like the mayor beat us to it .
nothing happens in boston
without the brahmin families knowing about it .
right . brahmins .
upper ... crust .
is that the manifest from the mayflower ?
look -- balthazar fairfield .
is that him ?
made his money like all the first families .
right , from shipping ?
yeah -- rum , wine , slaves .
they don &apos;t seem to remember that part of their history .
the brahmins have been boston &apos;s social elite for centuries .
they live conservatively .
it would be considered declassic to flaunt your wealth .
this isn &apos;t flaunting ?
well , considering that they &apos;re billionaires , no .
sumner .
maura .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i hear you &apos;re running the medical examiner &apos;s office now .
this is , uh , jocelyn , adam &apos;s wife .
i &apos;m so sorry about adam .
at least he was doing what he loved .
uh , what was that ?
sailing .
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe he drowned .
we can &apos;t be sure that &apos;s what happened .
we &apos;re gonna need a description of the boat .
i think we should notify the boston harbor and the coast guard .
who are you ?
jane , can this wait ?
no .
i &apos;m detective rizzoli .
this is detective frost , boston homicide .
homicide ? why ?
we look into all unattended deaths .
when was the last time you saw your husband ?
they &apos;re just being thorough .
last night .
he left very early .
do you know if he was wearing a life jacket ?
never .
he said he could sail before he could ride a bike .
maura .
garrett .
i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you for coming .
detectives ...
i &apos;m robert colburn ,
legal counsel for the fairfield estate .
thank you for coming so quickly .
of course .
the family would like to cooperate in any way they can .
get me any questions you have in writing ,
and i will respond to them in 24 hours .
that &apos;s not really how we operate .
well , i &apos;m sure you can understand that the family is --
excuse me .
i flew in for the foundation gala .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s gonna be a memorial now .
maura . this must be garrett .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. fairfield .
i was explaining to the detectives --
that it &apos;s critical we get statements as quickly as possible .
isn &apos;t that right , maura ?
well , i &apos;m sure the family will be more than happy
to answer all of your questions as soon as they &apos;re ready .
i don &apos;t even have a cause of death .
we should just give them their space .
space ? how much space do they need ?
yeah , maybe we can , uh ,
set up some interviews over the next few days .
oh , hey ! do you not get it ?
they &apos;re not setting up interviews .
quit looking at the car !
whoa , hey , whoa . that &apos;s not a car .
that &apos;s a work of art .
yeah , you &apos;re a tool .
do you get tired in the afternoon ?
forget where your keys are , your phone ?
well , polynesian people
are among the healthiest and happiest people on the planet .
now science knows why .
and it comes in a bottle .
how long has this been going on ?
a while .
i got the two @-@ bottle special .
your mother &apos;s really a good saleswoman .
if you buy now , i &apos;m offering a two @-@ for @-@ one special .
it &apos;s an excellent value .
and if you sign up for a year ,
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s less than a daily cappuccino .
come here , ma . come on .
excuse me one second . my son .
what ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m the authorized sales associate
for the polynesian anti @-@ aging lychee fruit flush .
did you know that
polynesians were among the healthiest --
since when are you doing this ?
since it single @-@ handedly cured carla talucci &apos;s colitis .
carla talucci ?
yeah .
the only woman in the neighborhood
who actually fell for the nigerian bank scam ?
take a bottle on me .
take it three times a day with meals .
it &apos;ll change your life .
do you have to do this here , ma ?
the people here will be astonished
at the change in their lives --
digestion , bowel movements --
ma !
what ?
just bring this to jane .
maybe it will help both of you with your irritability .
the body of adam fairfield was found
floating early this morning in boston harbor .
now , fairfield was only 42 years old ,
but he was the head of the fairfield empire ,
a collection of boston @-@ based corporations ,
financial institutions , philanthropic groups ,
things like that .
he was also , though , a member of one of the oldest , most ...
why are you doing the autopsy on a sunday ?
did they cancel
all the kundalini @-@ pulao @-@ riku yoga classes ?
kundalini is sacred energy work ,
pulao is a savory rice dish ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure that you made up that last word .
well , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not as educated as you
and your deluxe friends .
thanks for the support with them , by the way .
their brother just died .
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t stand there
and just let you badger his family .
badger ?
is that how you describe how i do my job ?
and since when do you rush the science ?
i &apos;m not rushing anything .
you &apos;re scrambling to finish out the autopsy .
the governor called .
he would like the reports right away .
of course he did . did you have a nice chat ?
maybe tonight you could attend the opera with some senators ,
and then afterwards go out on the veranda
and smoke big rolled @-@ up wads of $ 100s .
these people are not the enemy .
yeah , neither was columbus .
tell that to the native americans he killed with smallpox .
the fairfields helped build this city .
my grandfather was an ironworker .
he helped build this city .
okay , so -- so what are we arguing about here ,
history or are you just mad at me for who my friends are ?
this is about work . okay ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve just never seen you hugging suspects before .
we don &apos;t even know what happened here .
if this was an accidental drowning ,
there are no suspects .
so you &apos;re hoping it &apos;s an accident .
are you hoping it was a murder ?
i &apos;m doing my job like i always do .
why don &apos;t you do yours ?
i am .
and as a medical examiner ,
it is my job to determine the cause and the manner of death ,
so i &apos;ll tell you whether there &apos;s a case here or not .
maybe i &apos;ll just figure it out for myself .
this is great .
what ?
our suspects .
never seen so many rich , white faces .
it &apos;s &quot; clue &quot; --
jocelyn fairfield in the parlor with a knife .
their money goes back to plymouth rock .
据传1620年移民到美洲的清教徒由此处登岸
oh , they made plenty of enemies in the last four centuries .
check this out .
the tabloids say adam fairfield &apos;s marriage
was on the rocks .
what about his brothers , sumner and garrett ?
the victim was the oldest brother .
you know , dr. isles dated the middle brother .
no kidding .
makes sense , i guess .
these people think they &apos;re royalty .
but look , even though adam was the oldest ,
sumner , the youngest , took over the family firm .
maybe adam was a screwup .
not for long .
he took over the business five years ago .
what about garrett , the middle brother ?
he owns a successful clothing company in milan .
look at this --
fraud allegations against sumner .
that &apos;s why adam took over .
&quot; sumner fairfield now finds fulfillment
with hands @-@ on work at a food pantry . &quot;
no one comfortable in a mansion the size of my neighborhood
chooses to do hands @-@ on work of any kind .
let &apos;s go talk to him .
when &apos;d you last talk to harbor patrol ?
two minutes ago . you were right here listening .
you tell them to find adam &apos;s boat ?
no , i left that part out .
i ran the company for six years
while adam partied and raced yachts .
story is he came back and took over
because of fraud allegations ?
you really don &apos;t know how the game is played , do you ?
no , i never played the entitlement game .
i played the south boston game ,
on asphalt with broken bottles , used needles .
educate me .
adam got sick of clubbing ,
so i gave him a job .
next thing i know , the board &apos;s accusing me of fraud ,
and he &apos;s c.e.o.
why didn &apos;t the business go to him in the first place ?
i mean , he was the oldest .
he and my dad fought a lot .
he waited until dad was dead before ...
before what ? setting you up ?
yeah , he set me up . guys , tim !
no , these go to the westerville pantry !
how bad did you want to even things up ?
fairfields will do a lot of things to each other , detective ,
but brothers don &apos;t kill brothers .
yeah .
where were you saturday afternoon ?
motorcycle ride . beacon hill to new bedford .
beautiful day .
you guys want to see the gas receipts ?
anyone go with you ?
no . i ride alone .
come on -- westerville pantry .
wrong palette !
you guys are way off . it wasn &apos;t me .
adam was an experienced sailor .
so he didn &apos;t just fall off the boat .
well , what do you think ?
tom !
i think i &apos;d like to see a picture of sumner on his bike .
cashmere .
what will this set me back , couple hundred ?
well , those are from garrett &apos;s line .
the sweaters start around , oh , $ 1,000 .
what &apos;s it made of , spun platinum ?
the downy undercoat of cashmere goats .
this texture should be softer .
must be from the sea @-@ salt exposure .
or maybe the goat was getting even .
that depression on the bone , what &apos;s that from ?
oh , it &apos;s hard to tell .
maybe the victim fell
and hit his head on the edge of the boat .
hey , doc --
you want to tell me
why i &apos;m really here on jane &apos;s case ?
oh , well , i @-@ i thought i could get the benefit
of your sailing experience .
i got a little sunfish i throw in the back of the truck
and take out to the cape .
well , you know , it -- it seems like the victim , you know ,
hit his head on the boat , maybe slipped , fell overboard .
w @-@ what &apos;s your take ?
my take is that you are the chief medical examiner ,
and this is not your first floater .
it -- it is my , uh , my 43rd .
yes , my -- my 43rd .
i &apos;ve been a cop a long time .
i know when people aren &apos;t telling me the whole story .
jane &apos;s mad at me .
oh , boy .
she thinks i &apos;m being biased
because i &apos;m acquainted with the family .
&quot; acquainted &quot; ?
i heard it was a little more than that .
it was .
that &apos;s not it , though .
when you grew up like jane ,
you &apos;re gonna have an attitude about people who ,
uh , who are entitled .
that &apos;s a form of prejudice .
where people like me and jane come from ,
we didn &apos;t have a lot .
but we had each other &apos;s backs .
sounds to me like all jane wants to know is ,
do you have hers or not ?
hey . so ma &apos;s got a new job .
selling that .
carla talucci ?
can you have the crime lab run a test on it ?
i just want to make sure she &apos;s not gonna kill anybody .
yeah , sure .
what &apos;s up ?
ma &apos;s wearing lipstick every day .
she just bought some new clothes .
big new job hawking anti @-@ aging potion .
it makes sense .
what if there &apos;s more to it than that ?
i mean , maybe she &apos;s thinking about leaving dad .
detective rizzoli .
all right , i &apos;ll see ya .
mr. colburn ...
we subpoenaed a lot of records from the estate .
i don &apos;t see you carrying any files .
there are sensitive international finances involved .
we can &apos;t have those documents floating around .
so the fairfields are above the law ?
not at all .
we &apos;re giving our complete cooperation .
yeah , i can see that .
look , i &apos;m not fooled by your $ 5,000 suit .
i ran your background . i know where you come from .
st. luke &apos;s parish . that &apos;s a tough neighborhood .
well , i &apos;ve come a long way from there .
maybe too far
when you &apos;re blindly protecting rich bosses .
my father collected trash .
i &apos;d be doing the same
if it wasn &apos;t for the fairfields .
their foundation put me through college and law school .
they gave me a job , they let me rise to where i am now --
what , they &quot; let &quot; you ?
i have assurances from the top authorities in the state
that this matter will be handled swiftly and discreetly .
you got that ?
i will handle this case the way i handle all my cases .
you seem like a bright young woman with a promising future .
i &apos;d hate to see your career path cut short .
i had b.r.i.c detectives go through
27 hours of security footage on sumner &apos;s bike route .
let me guess -- no sign of him or his motorcycle .
nope . nothing .
jane &apos;s getting stonewalled by colburn .
can &apos;t get near the wife .
no idea if the wife even has an alibi or not .
can &apos;t talk to garrett , either .
he flew in from los angeles by private jet sunday morning .
after the murder .
preliminary autopsy report .
why give that to us instead of jane ?
don &apos;t go there .
there &apos;s evidence of blunt @-@ force trauma ,
which could have happened when he fell off the boat .
pulmonary edema from drowning .
his stomach contents were &quot; unusually well @-@ preserved . &quot;
it &apos;s odd because i was able to determine
that he had belon oysters at his last meal .
belon oysters ?
they &apos;re supposed to be amazing .
what are you , a friggin &apos; foodie now ?
well , they are prized
for their unique tannic seawater flavor .
i read about them in the weekly .
only a couple restaurants in town serve them .
maybe we can figure out where he ate lunch .
any restaurant near a harbor ?
maison de la mer . nahant .
hey , i like oysters .
they fry them , right ?
what ? no , no , no .
they serve them raw on the half shell .
come with us .
i will . thank you .
belon oysters served raw with a touch of natural sea salt ,
and the chef recommends you not chew them .
food you can &apos;t chew . and you pay for that ?
have you seen this guy in here recently ?
i can &apos;t say that i have .
lot of that going around .
damn , that &apos;s good .
dry , metallic . delicious .
you can &apos;t look at a dead body ,
but you could slurp that snot down ?
that &apos;s what it is , you know -- oyster snot .
whoa . receipt from a corporate card --
sullivan control systems .
it &apos;s a fairfield subsidiary .
&quot; john hancock . &quot; that &apos;s hardly creative .
hey , pal , can you pull the order off this receipt ?
sure you &apos;re not gonna eat that ?
more for me .
glass of chateau de beaucastel sirah ,
mount eden chardonnay , nicoise salad , d.o.s.
dressing on the side .
it &apos;s chick food .
no , no , no . y @-@ you &apos;re accurate .
i do prefer my dressing on the side .
may be a guy watching his cholesterol .
over fine wine at a romantic , seaside restaurant ?
maybe he loves his wife .
uh , jocelyn said she didn &apos;t see him that day .
so who did ?
it &apos;s got 24 @-@ karat gold flakes in it .
are you making fun of me ?
no ! i thought it would be fun to try .
will you run some tests on this please ?
what case ?
is jane &apos;s mother poisoning the neighborhood ?
sure .
so , you gonna try the chocolate ?
what are you so dressed up for ?
no reason .
is this an apology ?
for what ?
oh , boy .
you ask her .
jane thought maybe garrett would tell you the name of the woman
his brother had lunch with before he died .
so this is a bribe .
tell jane that if she thinks that chocolate will induce me
to use my personal relationship with garrett fairfield ,
she doesn &apos;t know me very well .
tell maura that i didn &apos;t realize
i needed to bribe her with the hope diamond ...
my phone .
to ge--
i got to take this .
korsak .
you looked really at home in that world .
it &apos;s where i &apos;m from . it &apos;s not where i chose to stay .
well , what are you doing down here slumming with us ?
the same as you !
i &apos;m catching bad guys .
i need the job . you don &apos;t .
look , i want my life to have meaning and purpose ,
the same as you .
sounds good , maura .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to believe anymore .
i &apos;m not even sure whose side you &apos;re on .
your form still looks good .
so does yours .
you still running marathons ?
once a year .
i don &apos;t really have time for more . work &apos;s pretty busy .
is that why you &apos;re here ?
please tell me you didn &apos;t learn how to lie .
that was one of your most endearing traits .
the investigators think that your brother
had lunch with a woman before he died .
they were hoping you might know who .
there &apos;s a reason i based my clothing company out of milan .
i think i know why .
we used to talk a lot , remember ?
it might &apos;ve just been talk if it wasn &apos;t for you .
you inspired me to take a risk ,
go out on my own , get away from the clutches of my family .
and you did it . you got out .
sumner and adam , they fought a lot .
so what are you saying , that -- that sumner
had something to do with adam &apos;s death ?
no .
fairfields will do a lot of things to each other ,
but ... brothers don &apos;t kill brothers .
you &apos;re not married , are you ?
no .
i have to come back to boston and run the business .
i can &apos;t leave it to sumner .
he &apos;s a mess .
do you know who adam was seeing ?
would you tell me if i promise to be discreet ?
there hasn &apos;t been anyone serious for a long time .
how long ?
college .
rizzoli .
jane .
maura , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay . listen , i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
adam had a mistress . vanessa dewald .
why -- why are you doing this ?
because i have your back .
i gotta go .
thanks .
miss me ?
yeah .
rizzoli just called . nicoise @-@ salad eater has a name .
vanessa dewald .
adam fairfield &apos;s mistress ?
rizzoli tracked her down , talked to her .
her alibi checks out , but she had this interesting tidbit --
adam was divorcing his wife .
rich guys have prenups .
jocelyn stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars
if adam divorced her .
that &apos;s hundreds of millions of motives .
korsak .
great . on our way .
harbor patrol found the boat .
i &apos;ll call jane .
excuse us , gentlemen .
boat was found in our waters .
it &apos;s a federal investigation now .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a nice ventriloquism act .
yeah , i can barely see your lips moving .
our tow boat &apos;s on the way to take this craft to our slip .
that craft is our crime scene .
it &apos;s our jurisdiction . move .
you want kids ?
i would move .
all right . you win .
blood on the boom .
hit his head , he got disoriented , fell overboard .
it &apos;s an accident .
i got his wallet
and some sort of inhaler .
he had asthma .
furling rig , twin helms , graceful shear ,
teak @-@ capped rail , french --
she &apos;s a beaut .
man , you need to get some .
this from a man who makes love to an oyster ?
jane , i did a once @-@ around the hull --
no scrapes , no fender marks .
nothing docked with her at sea .
man , i &apos;m cool , all right ?
i can admit when i &apos;m wrong . call it an accident .
i wish i could .
but it wasn &apos;t an accident .
adam fairfield was murdered .
the mikrosil casting came back .
we got a partial impression of the object
that struck adam fairfield &apos;s skull .
it wasn &apos;t the boat &apos;s boom ?
there &apos;s nothing on that boat
that matches the impressions left on adam &apos;s skull .
so somebody planted the blood on the boom .
that &apos;s the only explanation i can come up with .
so , the killer hides on adam &apos;s boat ,
he waits until adam is out to sea ,
hits him over the head with a weapon
and then throws the weapon and the body overboard .
yeah , but how does he or she get back to shore ?
maybe a boat or a dinghy .
korsak said there was nothing docked against the boat .
then there &apos;s an accomplice on another boat nearby .
it &apos;s a pretty perfect murder .
except that the imprints of the skull would match the weapon .
which is 20,000 leagues under the sea .
oh , that &apos;s actually a reference to unit of distance .
leagues across the ocean , not depth .
it &apos;s at the bottom of the ocean .
do you have a plan of finding it ?
not a good one .
what ?
there &apos;s just something about these fibers
on adam &apos;s cashmere sweater .
i &apos;m gonna have the lab take another look at it .
you want to get a drink ?
will it have gold flecks in it ?
no .
the cabernet here is chalky .
have a beer . it &apos;s cold .
i don &apos;t drink beer .
right .
well , we know for a fact that it &apos;s a murder ,
and we have two solid suspects with motive --
the wife , &apos; cause she didn &apos;t want a divorce ,
and sumner , because he &apos;s pissed at adam for pushing him out .
and colburn , who won &apos;t let you near them .
please don &apos;t talk to me about that guy .
ok , fine .
you want to tell me what happened with garrett ?
there &apos;s not much to tell .
i loved that guy .
you know when you &apos;re so in love ,
you feel like you took some kind of a substance ?
oh , that &apos;s just narcissism .
maybe .
by the way , i , uh , i ran some tests
on your mother &apos;s miracle juice .
it &apos;s 98 % water .
the rest is sodium citrate , monopotassium phosphate .
anything harmful ?
no .
but there &apos;s nothing helpful , either .
i should tell frankie .
oh , i brought you a -- a present .
apology or bribe ?
&quot; the fairfield family invite you and a guest to a memorial . &quot;
uh , maura , this is tonight .
yeah , i wasn &apos;t gonna go .
but you wanted access to my deluxe frineds ,
sumner and jocelyn .
i want you to be my guest .
won &apos;t i embarrass you ?
probably . but haven &apos;t i embarrassed you ?
no ...
more than half a dozen times .
&quot; cocktail dress required . &quot;
can &apos;t i just go like this ?
if you &apos;re going to embarrass me ,
at least do it in the proper clothes .
come on .
i have most of my money tied up in charitable endowments ,
but not all .
i feel like i &apos;m at my junior prom .
what ?
okay , i think i &apos;m getting a wedgie .
cover me .
oh , god .
can &apos;t you do this in the bathroom ?
no , it &apos;ll just take a second .
thank you .
thank you .
thanks .
that is good .
lefevre brut .
can &apos;t get that at 7 @-@ eleven , can you ?
man . how much ?
how much ? i don &apos;t know .
guess .
no .
100 bucks ?
maybe . i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
100 bucks a bottle ? wow .
a glass .
really ? god , no wonder it &apos;s so good .
my mother would be trying to smuggle it home in her purse .
can you hold this ?
thank you .
oh , the results came back for the fibers on adam &apos;s sweater .
do you mind if i just send this to frost to check it out ?
no . go ahead .
maura .
you look beautiful .
thank you .
you remember my friend , jane rizzoli .
of course .
hello .
you &apos;re both absolutely breathtaking .
thank you .
thank you .
usually , this would be a celebration ,
a big gala to raise money for boston charities .
tonight , it &apos;s for adam .
i guess it falls on me to commission a painting of him .
and the trophy we won when we were 8 and 10 .
we used to trade it back and forth .
i brought it home for him .
it &apos;s a lovely gesture .
excuse me .
of course .
give me that .
give it to me .
i am hungry .
branzino with a meuniere reduction .
ugh , it -- it &apos;s looking at me
like i personally put the hook in .
how am i supposed to eat that ?
use your fish knife .
it &apos;s next to the melon spoon .
second from the right .
hold it like a pencil .
okay ?
use the tip to cut the backbone .
then you cut the tail ,
and you place it on the side of the plate .
use this edge of the knife to remove the skin ,
and place it at the head of the plate .
there we go .
okay ?
okay , uh , this is how we do it in my family .
it &apos;s okay . just eat it .
it &apos;s delicious .
why do they serve beef wellington after fish ?
and why does everything have to be so juicy ?
that &apos;s interesting .
that explains why their alibis don &apos;t check out .
because they were probably with each other .
killing adam fairfield .
detective . a moment .
right after i talk to your two pals
about killing adam fairfield .
please .
now , you &apos;ve wondered what i &apos;ve been covering up ?
well , now you know . they &apos;re having an affair .
no kidding .
but i know for a fact that they didn &apos;t kill adam fairfield .
oh , what do you got ? we love facts .
while adam was sailing , they were in a suite at the ritz .
all afternoon .
so we just went from two suspects to none .
actually ...
i think we may have a new one .
i looked into that fiber for you .
good cashmere is 14 microns thick .
this is 24 .
subpar materials .
w @-@ why would garrett be using cheap cashmere ?
because he &apos;s broke .
i called his suppliers .
he &apos;s behind on everything --
uh , materials , warehousing , manufacturing , packaging .
the guy hasn &apos;t paid a bill in months .
okay , that makes no sense . he inherited a fortune .
looks like he burned through it all and then some .
okay , just because his company &apos;s in trouble
doesn &apos;t mean that he &apos;s a killer .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe killing off your brother
and inheriting the family empire ,
paying off your debt , turns you into one .
but he flew in after the murder .
flew in from milan .
frost , uh ,
we can &apos;t get into that private jet manifest , can we ?
no , we can only track the plane .
looks like it stopped in l.a. to refuel .
got stuck there for three days . engine trouble .
and he and the plane arrived in boston after the murder .
can we prove he was on that plane ?
takes , what , three days to drive from l.a. to boston ?
oh . you think he did it in the spyker ?
maura , i &apos;m sorry .
you okay ?
i should &apos;ve seen it .
you did .
there is a reason that you didn &apos;t commit to him after college .
there is a reason that you &apos;re holding back now .
it &apos;s called gut instinct .
but there were clues , and i --
i couldn &apos;t put them together .
you did .
you did it subconsciously .
the oysters . that &apos;s how i missed it .
the oysters , and it was right in front of me the whole time .
okay , come on .
i @-@ i &apos;ll take it from here , okay ?
look , i @-@ i thought that adam had asthma .
but he was taking a drug to treat panlobular emphysema ,
which is why he couldn &apos;t digest food .
he wasn &apos;t a smoker .
that is great for him .
the damage was caused by a disorder
called alpha @-@ 1 antitrypsin deficiency .
s @-@ sweetie , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re telling me this .
it &apos;s inherited .
the illness that adam had ,
all of the fairfield children should have , but they don &apos;t .
because adam had a different father .
and that &apos;s who carried the fatal gene .
adam was a half @-@ brother .
so that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t inherit the family business .
because he wasn &apos;t part of the bloodline .
he wasn &apos;t a brahmin .
wait -- why didn &apos;t the father give it to garrett ?
he was next in line .
because they had a terrible relationship .
garrett always used to say
that he wanted to make his own way in the world .
and i &apos;m not sure he had a choice .
and then that didn &apos;t work because he was going bankrupt .
garrett said that brothers don &apos;t kill brothers .
i think he justified what he did
because in his mind , adam wasn &apos;t his brother .
it &apos;s motive , but it &apos;s not proof .
maybe garrett didn &apos;t do it .
jane , he did it .
and i think i know where the proof is .
it &apos;s how he got from l.a. to boston .
there &apos;s only one person i know
who could &apos;ve committed a murder one mile out at sea
and still gotten back without a boat .
a triathlete .
maura .
you know , you said brothers don &apos;t kill brothers .
but you knew that adam had a different father ,
so in your mind ,
that meant that he wasn &apos;t really your brother .
maura , come on .
you know me .
the murder weapon left a unique impression in adam &apos;s skull .
like this one .
it &apos;s the same pattern , isn &apos;t it , maura ?
we found it in your trunk .
run tests , maura . you won &apos;t find anything on that .
because this one is new .
the one that you used to kill your half @-@ brother
is at the bottom of the ocean .
have security escort the two ladies out .
step out of the pool .
colburn .
i think you should step out of the pool , mr. fairfield .
colburn , what are you doing ?
you work for me .
i work for the fairfields .
okay .
here we go .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m not really in a champagne kind of a mood .
good . it &apos;s beer .
i thought we would celebrate the simple things in life .
i don &apos;t really drink beer .
that &apos;s because you &apos;ve never had my beer .
okay , well , can we at least drink it your way ?
yes , we can . let &apos;s -- let &apos;s get this right .
remember when you asked me why i was slumming ?
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t have said that .
well , now you know .
okay .
cheers .
cheers .
okay .
that &apos;s delicious .
right ? wait till you try a spuckie .
i don &apos;t know what that is ,
