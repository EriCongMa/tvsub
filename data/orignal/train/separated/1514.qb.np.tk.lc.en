it was an uneventful morning -- quiet .
instead of saving every episode of &quot; the bachelor , &quot;
why don &apos;t you just hit yourself
on the head with a sledgehammer ? !
dad , turn down that song !
* no can do *
the kids had a friday off of school ,
so we picked up manny
and went to our favorite pancake place --
relaxing .
mitchell , hi .
what ? !
oh , have him tell cam
i &apos;ll pick him up for racquetball in an hour .
i can &apos;t even hear him it &apos;s so loud .
can everybody just shut up ? !
i hate it .
sorry about that . anyway ...
hello .
hello . is this phil dumpster ?
what do you want , gil ?
got to be kidding me . hang on .
i need you to send a gift to mom
for her birthday from the both of us .
no , i did it last year .
i know , and i need you to do it again .
look , i &apos;ve got a conference call at 1 : 20 .
then luke &apos;s tutor comes to the house ,
45 sales meeting ,
and i still got to get alex to judo .
and yet you somehow found time to bitch at me .
you really can have it all .
honestly , just get her a stupid gift card ,
you big baby !
why does everything with him have be so dramatic ?
why are we stopping ?
hey . oh . perfect .
okay , first you berate me on the phone ,
then you show up to my office and berate me in per--
oh , w @-@ what is this ? i don &apos;t care for this .
we got in an accident .
oh , my god !
we almost got in an accident .
that seems like a really important distinction .
there was this big truck ,
and it barreled through a stop sign ,
and it missed our car by inches .
oh , my god ! and everyone &apos;s okay ?
yes , just very shaken up .
but , mitchell , i am so sorry
that i yelled at you before .
look , i brought you the birthday card for mom ,
and you can sign it .
okay . thank you .
&quot; to our best friend . &quot;
that &apos;s a little sarcastic . it &apos;s her birthday .
no , i mean it .
mitchell , i almost died .
i want our mom to have a great birthday .
oh , and we &apos;re doing this again .
okay . oh , god .
yeah .
hi . i &apos;ll be there in a sec , yeah .
okay , my deposition got moved up .
that &apos;s great .
so i &apos;ll just have to move everything -- you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna eat in the car and then-
no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , no . give it , give it !
do you know what i was doing right before i almost died ?
exactly what you &apos;re doing .
humoring a relative ?
no , no , scheduling my life down to the last minute .
i mean , look at this --
&quot; call new york office -- 4 : 17 p.m. &quot;
do you realize that everybody
but us rounds up to the nearest five minutes ?
today made me realize something , mitchell .
no , i don &apos;t want to
be a 4 : 17 kind of person . do you ?
yes , i do .
&apos;cause that phone call needs to be done by 4 : 23
so that i am not a dead man by 4 : 41 .
give me my phone .
nope . nope . no . give me -- claire .
we &apos;re gonna do something together .
yes , take the rest of the day off .
i can &apos;t do that .
yes , you can . i did !
yeah , &apos; cause you work for your father .
no , no , no , we need this , mitchell .
we really need this .
claire , i &apos;m really swamped today , and i --
pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease ...
stop . just go .
pleeeeease can we slow down ?
you &apos;re chafing my wrist .
don &apos;t pretend you &apos;re not loving this .
okay . all right . i think i just skated through some pee .
c @-@ can we go back now ?
no !
no , because we are not appointment @-@ making control freaks .
we are having fun .
you are . i &apos;m just doing what you &apos;re making me do .
okay , okay , stop .
no , no , no . no , no , no .
let &apos;s go back , let &apos;s go back , let &apos;s go back .
why ? why do we have to go back now ?
why -- oh , i get it . i get it .
you &apos;re still scared to skate through the underpass .
what do you mean , &quot; still &quot; ?
what do you mean , &quot; scared &quot; ? what underpass ?
mitchell , you were 11 years old ,
and mom made me take you with me
when i was skating with my friend sophie king ,
and you were terrified to go through the underpass
&apos;cause it was dark ,
and you were sure it was filled with monsters ,
so we ditched you .
i don &apos;t remember this at all .
yeah , i skated away and called you a big baby .
sophie threw a rock at me
and you yelled , &quot; you &apos;re so gay . &quot;
i did do that .
oh , didn &apos;t i ?
we used to use that word a lot .
you used to be able to call anything gay .
do you ever miss that ?
no .
no .
that &apos;s hurtful .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry , mitchell .
you were scared ,
and i should &apos;ve held your hand through the tunnel ,
and i was -- i was not a good big sister .
i &apos;m so sorry . will you forgive me ?
yes , yes .
you do ?
yes ! i forgive you .
i love you .
love you , too .
love you !
okay , okay . okay .
let &apos;s do this .
yes , let &apos;s do this .
come on .
what ? what &apos;s happening ?
no , no , no , we &apos;re going -- we &apos;re going through the tunnel .
no . god , no . no , no , no .
oh , no , you got to get over this .
no ! all right .
okay . just let yourself go .
just let it go . just -- you know ? - yep . i &apos;m good .
uh , yeah , you got to get past it .
n @-@ n @-@ no . no , no ! no ! n @-@ n @-@ no ! claire , no !
n @-@ n @-@ no ! n @-@ no !
i felt bad when we got separated ,
but i knew that when he skated out
the other side of that tunnel ,
an emotional scar would &apos;ve been healed .
mitchell ? ! mitchell ?
no ! n @-@ no ! n @-@ n @-@ no ! n @-@ no !
oh , my god ! what happened ? what happened ?
it w-- it was terrible !
yes .
they took my wallet and my skates and my tie .
what -- what homeless person needs a tie ?
oh , my god . i am so sorry , mitchell !
okay , um ... can you give me my phone ?
&apos;cause i got to , you know , cancel my cards .
yeah , yeah , yeah . oh , god . i hope you have juice .
that thing has been buzzing like crazy .
oh , god ! okay . okay .
my meeting &apos;s been pushed up .
it &apos;s in 15 minutes .
okay , okay . okay , okay .
look at me . look at me .
this is a test , and we don &apos;t sweat the small stuff .
just let it go .
stop it ! stop it .
i know you think you discovered the new you ,
but you are controlling
even when you &apos;re trying to not be controlling .
so j-- give me your skates .
what ? why ?
you &apos;ve dragged me so far ,
we &apos;re closer to my office than we are to the car .
take &apos; em off !
he just wasn &apos;t ready .
but me ?
i had a message for the small stuff
that used to rule my life .
hey , phil . honey , how you holding up ?
good .
so , i &apos;m at the beach -- long story .
anyway , i was hoping you wouldn &apos;t mind
waiting at the house for luke &apos;s tutor .
actually , i would mind . i &apos;d mind quite a bit .
i &apos;m kind of busy .
okay , great .
suck it , small stuff .
why are we stopping ?
for many , a near @-@ miss with death is a wake @-@ up call .
but when a man misses his own near @-@ miss ,
he truly sees what he &apos;s been missing .
no more putting my dreams on hold .
five years ago , i made a bucket list .
it was time to start crossing things off .
scariest moment of my life .
oh , my gosh . i thought i lost you !
but amazingly , something great came out of it .
i found out how my sister truly feels about me .
girls , are you sure ?
positive . we &apos;ll walk home .
we almost died .
yeah .
a @-@ about what you said in the car ...
please don &apos;t make fun of me right now .
no , i would never .
it was actually really honest .
and i need to stop taking shots at your intelligence .
you don &apos;t do it that often .
well , you miss a lot of it .
there , i did it again .
did what ?
uh , it doesn &apos;t matter .
i always considered you to be this self @-@ absorbed person ,
but you &apos;re more substantial than that , aren &apos;t you ?
thank you .
you know what ? i &apos;m blowing off judo today .
let &apos;s hang out .
what should we do ?
makeovers .
okay .
great !
we &apos;re gonna walk right past my waxing place .
say goodbye to that gal stache .
if it were easy , everyone would be hot .
yep , you know , i @-@ it &apos;s not just my feet .
it &apos;s from when i walked into the stop sign
because you wouldn &apos;t give me back my --
okay , fine . i &apos;ll give you back your man @-@ goggles . here .
i just thought we might run into
some cute boys on the way home ,
but it &apos;s probably best we didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s a pretty angry lip you got there .
really ?
does everybody &apos;s get this red ?
well , you had quite a bit of growth .
i was gonna have that lady take a crack at your arms ,
but she had already sweat through her apron .
oh , my gosh !
i already have 100 likes on my picture of my new nails .
um , fyi , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sort of in the background there ,
screaming mid @-@ wax .
400 people liked this photo .
i was not one of them .
my art teacher
made a pithy &quot; blue period &quot; comment ,
人物头发 眉毛 眼睛皆蓝
and my top prom prospect
suddenly found a girlfriend in canada .
do you think i could get my sneakers back ?
ohh , i threw them away with the rest of your clothes
when you were in the changing room .
i thought about saving them for the housekeeper ,
but i couldn &apos;t remember if she had a son .
look , i &apos;ve tried really hard to put up with a lot since ...
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , i just had so much fun with you !
we don &apos;t do this enough .
i just wish there was something that you could teach me .
wait , what about your judo stuff ?
uh you &apos;re not interested in that .
no ! no ! i am ! come on !
karate @-@ chop me or something !
that is not --
okay . all right .
let &apos;s just do one simple move .
okay .
now , this won &apos;t wrinkle my top , will it ?
that was actually fun !
show me one more time .
oh , no !
oh , my gosh . i thought i lost you again .
wait , wait , wait . back up . again ?
oh , yeah , when we almost got killed ,
i thought i lost my phone .
it was really scary .
mentos @-@ pramp @-@ climb , test number two .
lesson learned -- when pressure builds to dangerous levels ,
it must be released .
is your lip getting better or your face getting redder ?
just gonna pop into the family room .
what the hell was that ? !
oh , i &apos;m just getting started !
why do you have to be such a silly --
haley , stop !
mom !
phil , honey .
i was already on edge .
the day before , i was with my mom at the park
when some guy on a bike swiped her phone .
he must have been a criminal mastermind .
he struck the one second she wasn &apos;t
taking pictures of joe .
the worst part is , i saw him grab it .
i had a chance to do something
and be a hero to my mom , but i froze .
what would you have done ,
made him the subject of a satirical cartoon ?
hey ! uh , they &apos;ve taken down presidents .
now , can you just support me here ?
there are only so many moments a son has a chance to --
very mature .
pick a fight then tune me out ?
it &apos;s not bothering me . stop it !
dad , turn down that song !
* no can do . *
you sure , manny ?
positive . i @-@ i &apos;ll walk home .
we almost died .
yeah .
white .
yes , i &apos;m sure .
why is it so hard for you to imagine
that a criminal can be white when most of the --
ah , the bicycle .
yes , yes , it was white .
i thought your phone got stolen ?
this is joe &apos;s phone .
this is why the terrorists hate us .
the universe is cold and unfeeling .
the only constant is chaos .
was that place out of chocolate @-@ chip pancakes again ?
we were all almost killed by a truck .
ay dios mio ! are you okay , papi ?
this was all phil &apos;s fault , wasn &apos;t it ?
he &apos;s always blaring that damn new wave music !
no . he swerved to avoid it .
saved my life .
but the game of life is rigged .
death always win .
okay , i know what you need right now --
a trip to the ice @-@ cream shop .
he doesn &apos;t need ice cream .
he needs to talk about what just happened to him .
well , i could go for some ice cream .
i know how to fix my son .
so , this is fixed .
go around .
normally , i &apos;d be avoiding these cracks
out of respect of your back , mom ,
but after today , it seems pointless .
that &apos;s it . get in .
no , jay , he &apos;s afraid !
it &apos;s only gonna get worse .
in . trust me .
five minutes in here , he &apos;ll be happy as a clam .
aah ! mama !
calm down .
this was a bad idea .
hop out .
good for you , jay . it has to be when he is ready .
nope . he &apos;s driving .
what ?
what ? i @-@ i can &apos;t .
you &apos;re doing it now .
jesus , take the wheel .
he &apos;s terrified to be in the back .
now you &apos;re gonna put him in the front seat
so that he can kill all of us ? !
can you not make this fear worse ?
i watched dede coddle mitchell
when he was afraid of the dark .
till he was seven , he &apos;d only blink one eye at a time --
gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea .
manny , you don &apos;t want to do this right ?
no , i really don &apos;t .
okay , papi , you know what ? let &apos;s switch .
i &apos;m going to drive .
i &apos;ve got a bombshell , mom .
ay , papi , thank you , but this is a very weird thing
to say when we &apos;re in this position .
no , i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m never driving .
no way .
you there . you there .
we &apos;re doing this my way .
ah , yeah , &apos; cause it &apos;s your way
or the highway .
oh , god . not the highway .
you always want me to be his dad .
well , i &apos;m being his dad .
oh , uh , i @-@ i &apos;m really scared , jay .
this is what we &apos;re fixing .
look , when i was a kid ,
i lived by a big , scary black lake .
i always thought there monsters in there and whatnot .
one night , my dad dragged me out of bed
and tossed me right in that cold water .
i was never scared of that lake again .
now , give it some gas .
mma ! aah !
that &apos;s another habit i wouldn &apos;t mind breaking ,
but , you know , right now we ... have to ...
oh , what am i doing ?
i hated my dad for that .
i ended up scared of him , not the lake .
manny , - it &apos;s okay .
over there ! on the bike !
the white guy that stole my phone !
i don &apos;t see anyone .
yes ! he just turned the corner !
the phone burglar ! he &apos;s getting away !
not this time .
up there to the left !
i don &apos;t see anyone !
i didn &apos;t see anyone either . i made it up .
i am not going to
drive my son around until he &apos;s 40 .
the only thing stronger than manny &apos;s fear
is his need to protect his mama .
oh , no ! he got away !
but you did very good , manny .
that was a frickin &apos; rush !
but we &apos;re not giving up . we &apos;re gonna find that guy .
no !
are you sure about this ?
just go . i &apos;m walking home .
i can &apos;t even hear him , it &apos;s so loud .
can everybody just shut up ? !
hello .
hello . is this phil dumpster ?
what do you want , gil ?
got to be kidding me . hang on .
is that your hot wife i hear ?
hey , is she still taking those yoga classes ?
hanging up .
w @-@ w @-@ wait . wait . real quick .
the listing at 225 cedar street , it &apos;s mine now .
you poached my listing ?
poached egg : 水煮蛋
poached it , seasoned it ,
and covered it in thorpe @-@ andaise sauce , my friend .
you should thank me , dumpy .
you &apos;re back in second place
with your favorite view ...
my sweet behind .
why does everything with him have to be so dramatic ?
why are we stopping ?
oh , my god ! i thought i lost you .
what &apos;s to tell ?
a truck runs a stop sign , i avoid it ,
everyone walks away , bing , bang , no boom .
there was a truck !
that was crazy !
everybody calm down . calm down . let &apos;s not overreact .
what ? !
dad !
we were almost just killed !
yes !
exactly . almost , which means we &apos;re all just fine .
you aren &apos;t the least bit upset ?
it &apos;s gonna take more than that to ruin a morning
that started with a whipped @-@ cream smile on my waffle .
okay , it may have affected me a little ,
but sometimes it &apos;s hard to know what you &apos;re feeling .
mostly , i was thinking about racquetball later
and hopefully giving cam a nice spanking .
fair warning , may be working out some anger issues
on the racquetball court this morning .
don &apos;t ask .
sounds good .
so , we &apos;re getting our new dryer delivered .
it &apos;s supposed to be eggshell ,
but , oh , it &apos;s not eggshell , it &apos;s white .
anyway , i &apos;m laying into the delivery driver ,
and mitchell strolls in and says , &quot; oh , it &apos;s fine , &quot;
and then offers him a piece of his banana loaf .
i heard that .
just once , i would like
mitchell to take my side .
i am constantly strolling in and saving him
like a little princess in the tower .
sometimes i &apos;d like to be the princess .
six of one , right ?
what ?
why are , why are we stopping ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m very confused , phillip .
trust me , this house is gonna sell at thorpe speed .
hey , guys .
oh , hey , phil .
i guess you heard . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , no , it happens all the time .
i just stopped by to give you guys a little care package
to show you there &apos;s no hard feelings .
class act , dung beetle .
here &apos;s the malpractice attorney
most of his clients have used after he &apos;s ripped them off .
you will be losing some sleep ,
but these have always helped my wife .
and this priest is retired ,
but i think he still does exorcisms ,
which you &apos;ll need after today .
listen , phil - - - it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s sad , really , to see a once @-@ mediocre realtor
reduced to this .
gil , please , let &apos;s keep this civil .
oh , by the way , if you ever speak disrespectfully again
about my wife , i &apos;ll kill you .
sorry . that sounded like a joke .
i will actually kill you .
anyhow , when you guys wake up
and smell the sulfur ,
here &apos;s a list of other realtors ,
and if you need me , i &apos;ll be in the office at 9 : 00,
10 : 00 . i have the dentist .
where did that come from ?
life &apos;s too short to be ruled by fear .
what do you say
we get you the right dryer , princess ?
oh , my .
i mean , phil is usually just so ...
but then he was just , like , so ...
and then he got even more ...
there &apos;s nothing i can do .
i can &apos;t go for that .
no can do .
cameron here bought an eggshell dryer .
not white , not oatmeal ,
not swiss @-@ coffee ,
not baby @-@ powder , not bone .
eggshell . look , rob , is it ?
that &apos;s interesting .
here &apos;s how this is going down--
we don &apos;t leave without that eggshell dryer .
not swan @-@ feather , not chester @-@ pig @-@ white .
i think we &apos;ve covered the colors .
i sell houses to people every day
who ask me where they should buy their dryer .
i don &apos;t think you want me giving them any static .
i may have one in the back .
but it takes two guys to load the truck ,
and it &apos;s just me today .
is it ?
it was right about then
that a question started nagging at me .
is phil sexy ?
you feel like doing something a little crazy with me ?
what ? no . what ? no .
hey , honey .
phil , honey , how you holding up ?
good .
i &apos;m at the beach -- long story .
i was hoping you wouldn &apos;t mind
waiting at the house for luke &apos;s tutor .
actually , i would mind . i &apos;d mind quite a bit .
i &apos;m kind of busy .
okay .
cam , there &apos;s something that claire would never approve of
that i &apos;ve always wanted to do .
always ?
we &apos;re gonna want to put a blanket down on that backseat .
this was a huge mistake .
i am jammed in the backseat with a hairy peruvian biter .
it &apos;s spring break &apos; 92 all over again !
well , speed bump coming up . hold the leash taut .
it &apos;s supposed to keep her calm .
i got lucky . i don &apos;t think this one &apos;s a spitter .
uh , i spoke too soon .
you think ? that &apos;s it . pull over .
you know , phil , i wanted to support you on this .
i &apos;m a firm believer in livestock in the home ,
but you are out of control .
no , i &apos;m in control -- more than ever .
and if me getting what i want
inconveniences people a little ,
then so be it .
uh , she &apos;s nervous .
the guy said you should let her suck on your hair .
okay , that is it . i am done .
enough of this ridiculousness .
and thank you , phil ,
for making me appreciate mitchell .
he may have his faults ,
but at least he &apos;s not a crazy person .
phil , honey .
yes , claire .
i got an alpaca -- again .
and there &apos;s nothing you can say about it .
i &apos;m not saying anything . what &apos;s the problem ?
mom , dad !
there is a camel in the living room !
it &apos;s not a c--
i @-@ i just can &apos;t .
okay .
i see you &apos;ve all met jolene two .
sadly , the original jolene
that your mother made me return
was cruelly adopted by a children &apos;s hospital .
you see , something hit me this morning
when that truck didn &apos;t hit me this morning --
i have not been in control of my own life .
but those days are done .
well , i guess i &apos;m not in control of everything , am i ?
funny , isn &apos;t it ?
you can try and try , but in the blink of an eye ...
you can lose everything that matters to you .
dad , are you okay ?
don &apos;t you all see what &apos;s going on here ?
dad really wanted that milk .
i almost lost you guys today -- all of you .
just like that .
aw , daddy .
oh , honey .
you spent the whole day trying to control everything ,
and i spent the entire day trying not to ,
and neither way worked , did it ?
nope .
i may fight you on this ,
but i &apos;m gonna need you to make me get rid of jolene two .
she &apos;s a biter .
i know .
as soon as we &apos;re done with this hug .
hey , whatever this is ,
i need to get in on it .
i almost died today .
grandpa .
daddy .
aw , dad .
come here .
come here , you .
learn how to drive , lady !
i will get to the meeting when i get there .
i looked death in the face today .
hel-- hello . yes , i would like to leave a message .
my husband ordered an eggshell dryer --
not talc , not parchment
- eggshell .
you &apos;re home early . what happened to you ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
so , i called that appliance store ,
and i demanded that
you get the dryer that you wanted .
oh , well , it must &apos;ve worked
because they &apos;re taking away the wrong one right now .
anything for you , princess .
who &apos;s this guy ? get over here , sexy .
if you want to see sexy , i just ...
what is all over you ?
well , now you are .
