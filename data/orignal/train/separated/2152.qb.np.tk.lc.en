no bro pound ?
aonani , give me some love , huh ?
you be good out there , mr. zack .
i will .
well ...
auf wiedersehen , happy trails and all that .
hey , mom .
honey .
you &apos;re so thin .
what &apos;s up , little man ?
i missed you .
you know that ?
dad , i &apos;m sorry .
get in the car , son .
honey , we &apos;re lost .
why can &apos;t you just admit it ?
we are not lost .
looks like you crushed your old high score .
this is not the way we came .
honey , you took a wrong turn back there .
it &apos;s impossible .
i &apos;m following the gps .
well , then the gps is wrong .
we haven &apos;t seen a house for miles .
maybe we should turn around and go back .
honey , please , okay , just relax .
dad , speed up .
what ?
dad , speed up . don &apos;t stop .
what &apos;s going on ?
c &apos;mere , sit back buddy .
get away from us !
leave him alone !
what are you doing to him ?
zack !
let him go ! let him go !
zack !
let go of my son !
william .
mary , hey .
steve .
aloha .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good . i didn &apos;t realize you were
bringing your friend with you . who is this ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . my manners .
morty , this is steve .
pleasure to meet you , sir .
isn &apos;t it ?
so , this is the big brother , huh ?
doesn &apos;t look so big to me .
mary , please tell me you did not marry him .
ew , no .
of course not .
okay .
but i mean , not for lack of trying .
he &apos;s been proposing to me ever since we met .
why is he here ?
because i can &apos;t leave him .
what are you talking about ?
oh , i &apos;m his caregiver .
you &apos;re his caregiver ?
yeah , the flight attendant thing didn &apos;t work out so well .
steve , listen please .
i really think that this could be my true calling .
i love taking care of people .
well , that &apos;s funny , mary ,
because you can barely take care of yourself .
we take care of each other .
don &apos;t we , doll ?
morty , do you remember our conversation
about professional boundaries ?
no .
memory &apos;s not so good .
how about this , morty ,
you touch my sister again like that ,
i &apos;m gonna break your hand .
think you can remember that ?
he &apos;s as surly as you described .
at ease , sailor .
why is he here ?
because i have responsibilities now , steve .
and besides , visiting hawaii was on morty &apos;s bucket list .
okay , you know what ,
i need to talk to you in private right now .
morty , my brother needs to talk to me in private .
thank you .
so , what this big secret you can &apos;t tell me over the phone ?
it &apos;s about mom .
she &apos;s not coming , is she ?
i mean , you can &apos;t blame her , mom .
she thought you were dead .
where &apos;s she staying ?
okay . i &apos;ll just track her down myself .
acquiring target locations
is actually a specialty of mine , so ...
mom .
mom , mary &apos;s your daughter ; she &apos;s not a target .
i &apos;m sorry . look ...
give her some space , okay ?
give her some time .
when she &apos;s ready , she &apos;s gonna come to you .
and what if that never happens ?
is that her ?
no , no , no , stand down , mom .
it &apos;s work .
did you just tell me to stand down ?
affirmative . now , if you don &apos;t mind ...
okay , okay .
mcgarrett .
yeah , i &apos;ll be there in 20 .
none of this makes any sense .
zack &apos;s a good kid .
uh , you did just pick him up after a six @-@ month stay
at juvenile hall though , right ?
it was just a prank .
not exactly .
zack took things too far and he paid the price .
what exactly did he do ?
hacked into the white house database
and got tickets to the correspondents &apos; dinner .
they wanted to make an example out of zack ,
and they gave him a six month sentence .
what about when he was locked up ,
any trouble , fights that he got into ,
anything you know of ?
no .
none that he mentioned .
what are you guys doing way out here
in the middle of nowhere , anyway ?
i was just following the gps .
hey , charlie , is it possible to hack a gps
and send somebody off course ?
yeah , but it &apos;s a fairly sophisticated process .
i &apos;ll have to get it back to the lab to be sure .
you think someone lured them out here ?
well , it &apos;s a remote location .
it &apos;s the perfect spot to grab somebody
without any witnesses .
this was a highly planned and perfectly executed abduction .
your name is james , right ?
well , my name is kono , james .
and we &apos;re here to find your brother , zack .
maybe you saw something that can help us ?
can i see ?
you get something from the brother ?
yeah , license plate .
he was typing it over and over again on his tablet .
i &apos;m running it now .
okay , so the van was reported stolen yesterday .
looks like it was logged back in the system 15 minutes ago .
wait a minute , it &apos;s already been recovered ?
yeah , and it &apos;s headed on its way back
to the hpd impound lot .
you guys move fast .
i haven &apos;t even done inventory on it yet .
it &apos;s a kidnapping case .
time &apos;s a luxury we don &apos;t have .
what the hell ?
looks like our kidnapping case just turned to murder .
max , no cane . looking good .
mahalo . another couple of weeks ,
and i can resume my spinning classes .
that &apos;s nice , i just got a visual of you
wearing biker shorts .
thank you .
my pleasure .
now if you &apos;ll allow me to demonstrate my newfound mobility ,
i have some information on your murder victim .
the cause of death was cardiac arrest .
seriously ?
unquestionably .
wait a minute , how does a 17 @-@ year @-@ old
die of a heart attack ?
well , according to your victim &apos;s medical records ,
he suffered from a history of arrhythmia .
i believe that his condition was exacerbated
by physical trauma .
he was tortured .
yes , and from the looks of it , they broke his fingers
one by one , a crude ,
but effective torture method .
what could a 17 @-@ year @-@ old possibly know
that warrants being tortured to death ?
that would be your jurisdiction , detective .
that &apos;s why i asked him .
however , i did find something else quite interesting .
these bruises are consistent with cpr .
with cpr ? what , they tried to revive him ?
yes .
which means whatever they wanted
out of the kid ... they didn &apos;t get .
the warden said that zack was a model prisoner .
he kept to himself , and stayed out of trouble .
except for one incident ,
where he got into a shouting match
with someone who was visiting him .
now , kono checked all the visitor &apos;s logs ,
and other than his mother ,
the only person who came to see him
was kong liang .
who is he ?
kong liang .
chinese national and notorious cyber @-@ criminal .
fbi has him involved in
banking trojans , scareware , identity theft .
i mean , you name the cyber crime and he &apos;s into it .
he &apos;s also very into making money .
hpd cyber crime task force
estimates that he pulls down
between $ 25 million and $ 50 million a year .
okay , why is kong liang not in prison ?
the fbi &apos;s been trying to make a case for years ,
but he has the best hackers covering his trail .
word is , he runs his operation like a sweatshop ,
recruiting computer experts from around the world .
that would explain the prison visit .
yeah , maybe zack turned him down ,
or kong liang wanted information that zack had .
all right , so kong liang hires a couple of goons
to kidnap this kid the day he gets out of the can .
that &apos;s a hell of a recruiting pitch .
right . where do we find him ?
well , hpd has zero leads on his location .
the guy &apos;s a ghost .
no problem .
how is that no problem ?
it &apos;s no problem because you forget that i have
a ci deeply embedded in the hacker game .
these computer geeks , they all know each other .
there you go , brah .
completely reconditioned .
there &apos;s nothing free about free porn .
think before you link ...
hey , what &apos;s up , toast ?
jersey .
whatever it is , i didn &apos;t do it .
you got a minute ?
hey , look , guys .
before i talk , i just want to make sure
i @-@ i have total impunity .
you mean immunity .
yes .
that @-@ that is what i meant .
look , i &apos;m just worried about blowback .
i have mouths to feed , responsibilities .
roommates to think of--
rocky and bullwinkle .
a moose and a flying squirrel ?
no .
those are their hacker handles .
ah . my job at digi @-@ dome
is the only thing that &apos;s keeping us in cap &apos;n crunch .
what is that ? is that another hacker handle ?
will you speak english , please ?
it &apos;s a cereal .
people eat it in the mornings .
toast , listen .
whatever you tell us is going to be kept in strict confidence .
all right ?
look , if that means that no one &apos;s gonna find out
where this came from , then great .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not a snitch , okay ?
okay . now that we got that out of the way ,
maybe we can start with an easy one .
can you help us find kong liang ?
yeah , of course .
but that guy &apos;s beaucoup bad news , guys .
he runs a hacker crew .
and he invited me to come and be a part of it ,
but i politely declined because of the illegal nature of it .
this kid-- he ever work for kong ?
that &apos;s omega man .
zack slater .
i only know him by his hacker handle .
he &apos;s crazy good .
now he &apos;s crazy dead .
tortured and killed this morning .
and we have reason to believe
that kong and this is connected .
that &apos;s heavy .
i mean , if kong liang deleted zack ,
you guys are not gonna be able to
connect him to it .
well , that &apos;s fine .
we &apos;re gonna get him for hacking ,
we push for the maximum .
you &apos;re not gonna get him for that , either .
i mean , the moment he sees you two guys coming ,
uh , he will wipe his trail clean with one keystroke .
game over .
no , he won &apos;t .
why is that ?
well , &apos; cause it won &apos;t be us that he sees coming .
this is crazy , i can &apos;t ...
i ... i can &apos;t wear a wire .
this is crazy .
i @-@ i &apos;m ... this is against my philosophy .
stay alive .
would you shut up , please ?
okay . you &apos;re fine .
remember , we gave you impunity . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
remember , you &apos;re doing this for , uh , rocky and bullwinkle .
guys , there &apos;s ... there &apos;s something i haven &apos;t told you .
what is that ?
i ...
have a glandular issue .
what kind of glands we talking here , toast ?
um ... my sweat glands .
i usually use beta @-@ blockers in stressful situations like this ,
but you know ... too late .
sometimes , when it just starts ,
i just can &apos;t stop it , it just keeps going .
okay , enough .
it doesn &apos;t stop .
enough . enough . please .
i mean , what if i sweat so much
that it gets into this pack and it electrocutes me ?
that unit is gland @-@ proof . okay ?
hey , toast , toast .
just remember the plan , okay ?
you &apos;re there to offer your services , that &apos;s it .
when you get alone ,
i want you to download everything off his computer
onto this thing here . we will take care of the rest .
i don &apos;t think i can do this , guys .
toast ? live long and perspire .
all right ? it &apos;s gonna be great . okay ?
we &apos;ve confirmed kong &apos;s inside .
it &apos;s game time . come on .
let &apos;s go .
hey , guys .
i &apos;m here to see kong .
really like you guys matching stripes .
all right , toast , you &apos;re in .
this is a really bad idea , guys .
please , just relax . everything is gonna be fine .
i promise .
i have a retail job that i need to be alive to get paid for .
do you understand ?
toast , listen to me .
just tell kong you &apos;re after some quick cash .
when he &apos;s distracted ,
you do your thing , okay ?
well , if he doesn &apos;t get distracted , what &apos;s plan b ?
there &apos;s not a plan b because plan a is gonna work .
okay ? just relax ,
control your glands , everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
there &apos;s no plan b ?
how do you not have a plan b ?
everyone has a plan b.
we barely have a plan a.
stop talking , toast , okay ?
oh , my god .
what ? door &apos;s open .
get up .
see what you made me do ?
now , go get that fixed .
and then get back to work .
toast !
there &apos;s only one reason you &apos;re here .
uh , that ...
you want a job , right ?
yes , you want a job .
yes .
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t do this , guys !
plan b !
nice job , toast .
this is why you have a plan b.
three ... two ...
first one who walks through that door
goes out on a stretcher !
one ... go .
you done ?
i want to talk to my lawyer .
what , exactly , are you gonna tell your lawyer ?
that five @-@ o raided your illegal hack shop ,
during which you fired a big cannon at my face .
and then following your apprehension ,
we download everything on these goofy little computers ,
and we find out that you are indeed
a world @-@ class cyber thief .
go ahead , call . use my phone , i &apos;ll dial it for you .
you know what , don &apos;t forget to tell your lawyer
about kidnapping and murdering zack slater .
i don &apos;t know no zack slater .
oh , really ? that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s actually very funny ,
because we have you visiting him just a week ago .
what happened , you offer him a job ,
he turned you down , so you kill him ?
correction : you tortured him ,
and then you killed him .
was it a job ... or were you trying to
get information and it went bad . what ?
this kid could hack into
the most secure mainframes in the world
in the time it would take you to sign into your e @-@ mail account .
so that &apos;s why you went to see him in prison ?
i invited him to work for me .
this @-@ this kid &apos;s in jail ,
and you still offer him a job ?
i enjoy the challenge .
but he said no ?
kid didn &apos;t want to disappoint his parents again .
so he was done hacking .
must have pissed you off .
kong liang offers this kid a job ,
and he says no .
yeah .
but i decided to play the long game .
figured if he ever came around ,
he knew he &apos;d have a job .
okay . who else do you know that was after this kid ?
i don &apos;t know .
kid hacked a lot of people
before he suddenly grew a conscience in the joint .
any one of them could be looking for a little payback .
i remember the day ...
that you told me that mommy wasn &apos;t going
to be coming home anymore .
i remember that night i went into your room and ...
... i saw you sitting on your bed , crying .
and that scared me , dad .
i miss you so much , dad .
i slept on steve &apos;s floor
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t want to be alone , you know ...
and i guess i &apos;ve been that way ever since .
but when steve just told me that she was alive ...
... all i could do was think
about you that night crying , dad .
i &apos;m just so angry for what she &apos;s put you through .
and i miss you so much .
i miss you .
i miss you , and it just hurts so bad .
i love you .
all right . thanks for coming .
where else was i going to go ?
i &apos;ve been to a lot of stone gardens , kid ,
but i got to say , this is by far the nicest .
not too shabby a place to end up , i think .
i think you have to be part of the military
to be buried here .
sweetie , i &apos;m retired air force--
the 34th bomb squadron-- so sign me up .
come on , now , we still have a whole island to see , morty .
now , that &apos;s my girl .
now , mush .
ready ?
yeah .
let &apos;s go .
what &apos;s up ?
so , i had the lab take a look at zack &apos;s laptop .
you mean the one they confiscated
when he was arrested .
yeah , so nothing stands out on the hard drive ,
but take a look at this .
right before he was sent to juvie ,
zack uploaded a file to this offline storage site .
what &apos;s on the file ?
no idea .
because the password has a 1024 @-@ bit encryption ,
which means the password is 309 numbers long ,
which means it &apos;s impossible to crack unless we have the code .
right-- well , whatever &apos;s on that file , it must be important .
maybe that &apos;s what zack &apos;s killers were after .
yeah .
i &apos;ll get toast on it , see if he can hack in .
okay , that &apos;s gonna take days .
which is why you need
to pay zack &apos;s parents a visit now .
see if we can expedite things .
okay , how &apos;s that gonna help us get a password any faster ?
well , with a password that long , zack may have written it down .
see if they know anything .
if they don &apos;t , check the house .
maybe he hid it somewhere .
i just should &apos;ve forgiven him .
he knew that you loved him .
i just wish i could &apos;ve told him .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
how can we help you ?
it &apos;s actually why i &apos;m here .
we believe the men who murdered your son
wanted something that he had .
what could they possibly want from zack ?
a password ... to his offline storage site .
a password ? he never said anything about a password .
do you mind if i look up in his room ?
no , uh ... it &apos;s , uh , upstairs to the left .
aloha .
it &apos;s all right .
your parents said it was okay that i was up here .
you want to hold it ?
f @-@ i @-@ v @-@ e , zero .
five @-@ o.
it &apos;s like a special kind of police officer .
you know , james ...
you might be able to help me .
i &apos;m looking for something that your brother zack ...
... may have left here .
it &apos;s very important .
it &apos;s called a password .
do you know where he might have kept it ?
gold .
gold-- are you talking about my badge ?
zinc , argon , nitrogen ,
palladium , bromine , ruthenium ...
okay , hold on ... what are you trying to say ?
mercury , copper , thallium ...
did your brother teach you that ?
james ?
can you share with me what your brother taught you ?
gold , zinc , argon ,
nitrogen , palladium , bromine , ruthenium ,
mercury , copper , thallium , ununtrium .
okay , can you tell me from the beginning one more time ?
gold , zinc , argon ,
nitrogen , palladium ,
bromine , ruthenium , mercy ,
copper , thallium , ununtrium .
chin , i have the password .
so it &apos;s the periodic table ?
yeah , zack had his little brother james memorize
a string of elements ,
so i started writing down
the atomic numbers in that order ,
and i figured it out .
it &apos;s 309 numbers .
it &apos;s zack &apos;s password and we got it .
good work , kono .
all right , give me a second to upload ...
kono ?
get out ! get out !
don &apos;t shoot , don &apos;t shoot !
move it !
james , can you come with me ?
get up , now !
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re not going to hurt you .
if you have mobile device or all these decice ,
you should &apos;ve known those have been disabled .
if you try to use it , you will get shot .
so stay calm !
stay calm !
go upstairs and do it now .
ladies and gentlemen ...
you need to be really quiet . i am not going to hurt you , okay .
hands on your head , right now !
i &apos;m sorry , i was looking for the bathroom .
shut up ! let &apos;s go , downstairs !
move it !
hey , where you going ?
slater house .
i just got a call from kono-- she was about to give me
the password to zack &apos;s storage site
and then the phone went dead and i can &apos;t reach her now .
i got a uni heading over there right now ,
but i got a bad feeling about this , steve .
officer . can i help you ?
good afternoon , ma &apos;am .
everything okay inside ?
yes , of course .
i was told officer kalakaua would be inside .
is she here ?
she was here .
she , uh , she left about 20 minutes ago .
looks like i just missed her . well , have a good day .
okay .
10 @-@ 15 ! 10 @-@ 15 ! i &apos;ve been shot !
i repeat ...
all units , all units ,
we have an officer down .
unit two , bravo @-@ 170 is off at ...
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s move it out !
stop right there !
well ,
thanks to officer manuwai ,
the plan has changed .
go , go , go , go , go !
chin !
i &apos;m calling everyone in on this .
where &apos;s kono ?
they got her .
all right , flir scan shows 19 people inside .
judging by motion patterns ,
we have got four hostage takers .
all right , phone lines are jammed .
chin , how &apos;d you do with the cars ?
all right , we checked every vehicle in the area--
we found one that was reported stolen .
that &apos;s our killer &apos;s m.o ..
yeah . crime lab lifted a print off of it ,
but when they ran it through afis , they didn &apos;t get a match .
widen the search .
check military databases , foreign and domestic .
military databases ? why ?
chin , these guys have fortified their position here ,
they &apos;re using the hostages as a human shield ,
they jammed the phone lines .
they &apos;re pros , okay ?
they &apos;re either ex @-@ military
or they &apos;re civilian contractors .
either way , there &apos;s got to be a record of them somewhere .
yeah , i &apos;m on it .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re gonna be here for a while . settle in .
did you find it ?
not yet .
maybe it &apos;s not here .
oh , it &apos;s here .
come on , daddy .
let &apos;s go .
get down . turn around .
your son took something from me .
i want it back now .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , i swear .
please . please . don &apos;t hurt her !
listen , listen ! that is totally up to you .
why don &apos;t you just leave them alo ...
what the hell &apos;s going on in there ?
i &apos;m going to ask you one more time .
if you don &apos;t give me the answer i &apos;m looking for ,
you get to watch your wife die .
do you understand ?
yes .
guys .
you were right .
military came back with a hit on that print .
sean winston .
ex @-@ south african special forces .
i &apos;m just taking a wild guess here ,
this guy went into business for himself ?
yeah .
he started a private military company called white fire .
white fire .
they specialize in covert ,
wet work , black ops--
the dirty stuff the governments don &apos;t want to admit to .
that doesn &apos;t explain
what they want with a high school kid .
well , white fire would have a lot of secrets
they &apos;d kill to keep hidden . maybe zack stumbled upon one of &apos; em .
if you &apos;re right i really hope that one of those secrets
is not worth another body .
hey , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what &apos;s up ?
i sent her in there .
okay .
you don &apos;t put that on yourself , you got it ?
we &apos;re gonna get her out .
so let &apos;s go do that .
yeah .
last chance .
where did your son hide the password ?
i don &apos;t know . i swear ,
i don &apos;t know anything about a password .
please don &apos;t hurt my wife .
that is not the answer
i was looking for !
i thought you said you checked upstairs .
i did .
check again .
who &apos;s up there ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
no .
shut up .
shut up .
please don &apos;t hurt my little boy .
pipe down . shut up .
james .
look what i found .
well , well , well ,
it looks like one of you
is five @-@ o.
i &apos;ll give that person five seconds to come forward ...
... or i will put a hole in this child !
no !
five ... four ...
three ... two ...
no !
i &apos;m five @-@ o.
they don &apos;t have the password .
i do .
give me the password .
release the hostages .
not gonna happen .
the only way you &apos;re gonna get the password
is if you release the hostages .
once they &apos;re safe ,
i &apos;ll give you the password .
shoot me , you get nothing .
you &apos;re coming with us .
once the hostages are free .
yes , hello . i know you can hear me .
i &apos;d like to speak to the person in charge .
commander .
this is commander mcgarrett at five @-@ o.
commander mcgarrett , it seems like
we have one of yours with us .
what do you want ?
world peace . a cure for aids would be nice .
banquets for the hungry .
in the meantime ,
i will take an armored vehicle
backed up to the front of this house .
park and walk away .
once me , my team , and your friend drive away ,
you can come in and collect the hostages .
you have 20 minutes .
all right , guys , get back , get back .
come here ! get in there !
come on ! let &apos;s go !
check on the hostages , make sure everyone &apos;s all right .
i &apos;ll take the password , please .
you guys are good to go .
come on , come on , come on .
thank you .
in five !
all right , babe , we &apos;re good to go in five ,
four ...
three ...
two , one !
kono !
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
hey , guys .
hey , what are you doing ? i thought you were supposed
to be in the hospital ?
no , it &apos;s just a few scrapes .
you &apos;re okay ?
yeah .
you &apos;re just in time .
we unlocked zack &apos;s storage site .
turns out he had an encryption method
that even impressed toast .
mega awesome encryption , brah .
quote , unquote .
richard desalvo . zack must have hacked
into white fire &apos;s mainframe and downloaded his file .
so who is richard desalvo ?
he was a mob boss who disappeared
from protective custody three years ago .
had a rap sheet
that made whitey bulger look cuddly .
winston and his organization helped him disappear ,
for a price , of course , and then
they mopped up anybody who could turn on him if he was ever found .
richard desalvo !
look on the bright side ,
now you don &apos;t have to look over your shoulder anymore .
your son didn &apos;t die for nothing .
because of what he did , an infamous mobster
went to prison for the rest of his life .
thank you .
and thank you , james , for your help .
your brother would have been very proud .
f @-@ i @-@ v @-@ e , zero .
f @-@ i @-@ v @-@ e , zero .
keep it .
you earned it .
mary , i need you to do something for me .
what ? i &apos;ll do anything .
i need you to go see your mother .
i can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t or you won &apos;t ?
both .
morty , she disappeared from my life
when i was ten years old , morty .
gone .
this whole time i &apos;ve thought she &apos;s dead .
but she &apos;s not .
you get a second chance , kid .
other people aren &apos;t so lucky .
i &apos;d give everything i own to have a second chance .
what are you talking about ?
zoe anne sapperstein ...
my only daughter .
you had a daughter , morty ?
i didn &apos;t know you had a daughter .
yeah .
we got into a fight over this boy she was seeing .
her mother and i disapproved .
she left college and took off
for san francisco with the guy .
we didn &apos;t speak for years .
one day the phone rang .
it was the highway patrol .
carpet salesman from oakland had too much to drink .
he fell asleep behind the wheel and hit my daughter &apos;s car .
killed her instantly .
not a day goes by
i don &apos;t wish
i &apos;d picked up the phone
and called her .
i let the privilege of knowing her slip away because
i was a stubborn sob .
don &apos;t make the same mistake .
put away your anger .
go see your mother .
you only have one family .
mom ?
why ? !
why ?
