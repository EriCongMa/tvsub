gossip girl here .
you one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i love you .
dan .
that &apos;s not really the reaction i was hoping for .
what is that ?
it &apos;s from my father , and it &apos;s been opened .
you don &apos;t get to judge me ever again .
tell me that you didn &apos;t sleep with your ex @-@ husband .
i did kiss him , but that &apos;s all .
you have the wrong idea .
i &apos;m not some sort of trophy husband .
it &apos;s okay . we all sacrifice our independence for love .
you took the wrong boat .
no , actually , this is the one with the cash .
mine had the &quot; e &quot; in it .
i spent 18 years accepting
the fact my mother was dead .
your real mother would never turn her back
on a chance to know you .
i don &apos;t have a real mother , blair .
it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re alone .
i really think that we should try to take this slow .
yeah , yeah , i was thinking the same thing .
this wasn &apos;t a date .
if you want one , you &apos;ll have to ask .
get up and go at it , upper east side .
i hear little j. is having foreign relations with a handsome attach ?
we always knew she had friends in high places .
but how low will she go ?
what are you even doing here ?
you said your step mom hadn &apos;t gotten up before noon all week .
but if she does ,
then you &apos;ll be spending the day hiding in my closet .
kinky . all right , i &apos;ll go .
i just wanted to make sure we &apos;re still on for tonight .
oh , yeah . i was thinking italian .
maybe morandi or il buco ?
i mean , if you don &apos;t want to go downtown ,
we could just walk over to tony &apos;s .
oh , well , not that i don &apos;t love popcorn and a movie ,
but i mean , it &apos;s saturday night .
i wanted to go out .
we are .
in fact , we have half a dozen deliveries to make at some parties .
again ? you &apos;re the only dealer in town ?
no rest for the wicked .
i &apos;m gonna have to leave these here for the day if that &apos;s cool .
yeah , okay . jenny &apos;s drug way station .
i guess that &apos;s the one good thing about my parents
being in this huge , unexplained fight .
i can think of others .
hey , don &apos;t--don &apos;t you wanna answer that ?
no .
hello , father .
no . no , i can &apos;t this evening .
i have plans .
just a friend .
okay .
all right , shall we take care of this ?
what ?
nothing .
since when do you cook ?
honestly , i didn &apos;t even know
we had a fridge until this morning .
hey , hey , hey , hey ! we &apos;re not heathens .
stop .
i told you i was good in the kitchen .
the cocktail olives i could &apos;ve done without , though .
not really a breakfast food .
i &apos;m still hungry .
doesn &apos;t rufus make brunch on saturdays ?
i prefer this breakfast .
oh , god !
oh , god .
chuck !
of course .
not to be outdone .
god forbid .
yes ! that &apos;s it ! god !
yes !
oh , don &apos;t stop ! god , chuck !
oh , god , that &apos;s it ! yeah !
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
chuck ?
oh ! where are you ?
early meeting .
look , i forgot my cell .
can you stick it in my briefcase ?
god , yes ! chuck ! don &apos;t stop !
uh ... blair is sort of in there right now .
which is why i need you to grab it .
she can get curious , and right now is not a good time .
oh , god ! yes !
yeah , man . uh , i will do .
great .
yes ! god , chuck !
god , chuck ! yes !
oh , god , chuck !
blair ?
yes , right there ! oh !
haven &apos;t you heard of knocking ?
i did knock , but you didn &apos;t hear me .
we heard you , though .
i &apos;m sorry . was it awkward ?
are you trying to prove some kind of point ?
yes . but i shouldn &apos;t have to .
i &apos;m just glad i got chuck &apos;s couch scotchgarded .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
louis vuitton is doing metallic booties for spring .
b. ?
s. ?
talk to me . tell me what &apos;s wrong .
chuck and i aren &apos;t connecting right now .
you mean ...
not just like that .
but thanks so much for the constant reminder .
sorry .
he &apos;s shutting me out ...
in his head all the time .
normally , i &apos;d chalk it up to just him being him .
but ... last week he went through something ,
and ...
if he &apos;s still upset , i just want him to be able to talk to me .
well , how do you usually pull these things out of him ?
pretty much what you just heard , sans fashion magazine .
i &apos;ve tried all my tricks . he &apos;s not interested .
i just wanna make him feel better .
hey . melissa .
uh , dan . bit overdressed , aren &apos;t we ?
i have an extra pair of board shorts if you want to join me .
hit ocean drive ?
um ... uh ... maybe some other time .
just listen to me . all right , i @-@ i know i screwed up ,
and i don &apos;t blame you for not returning my phone calls .
but ... i miss you .
and what i said at the hospital , well , i meant it as a friend ,
only as a friend .
dan , it &apos;s cool . you don &apos;t have to explain .
no , no , no , no , no , i really do
because i @-@ i really want things to go back to the way they were .
what do you say ?
we could hang out today , we could remind ourselves
how normal it can be between us .
actually , the dorm &apos;s throwing
this huge south beach party tonight .
great , i love parties .
and i &apos;m going with paul .
i love paul .
don &apos;t you think the three
of us hanging out would be weird ?
weird ? no . no , i &apos;ll bring a date .
what date ?
well , if you would &apos;ve returned any number of my 10,000 phone calls ,
you would know that i &apos;ve started seeing someone .
i mean , it &apos;s not serious at all , but , uh ...
look , it &apos;ll be fun and normal . i promise .
fine . the party starts in an hour .
okay , great . all right .
wait . what &apos;s her name ?
melissa .
yeah , her name &apos;s melissa . it &apos;s a good name . see you soon .
hey , uh , do you know a girl named melissa ?
everybody decent in here ?
ah . got it .
what are you doing ?
um , my phone &apos;s dead . i was gonna use chuck &apos;s .
there &apos;s a phone in the living room .
i know .
i wanted to check a tweet .
wait . wait , chuck asked you to grab his phone
when he called , didn &apos;t he ?
chuck called ?
no . i mean , yeah , he called .
but he just wanted me to put his phone in his briefcase
so he doesn &apos;t forget it . that &apos;s it .
oh , god , i miss that .
what ?
dating someone who &apos;s a horrible liar . so much easier .
chuck didn &apos;t want me to see his phone .
hand it over , archibald .
nate .
there &apos;s half a dozen calls from a number i &apos;ve never seen ,
and ... a message .
one , two , three , four , five . jenny ?
i was just going out for a coffee ...
hi , lily . you &apos;re up really early .
uh , you remember damien , right ? he just stopped by .
what is going on here ? or do i even have to ask ?
lily , i &apos;m--i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so sorry . please , please don &apos;t tell my dad . please .
i want both of you in the living room now .
you , get dressed .
i shouldn &apos;t .
i turned over a new leaf--
a new , non @-@ meddling leaf from the trust tree .
if he wants to keep secrets , then ...
but he shouldn &apos;t . something is bothering him .
and he &apos;s not telling me about it .
what am i supposed to do , right ?
blair , put the phone down .
and talk to him when he gets home .
what ?
it &apos;s this number .
it &apos;s the same number he called me from this morning .
charles , it &apos;s me again .
i know i keep calling , but you haven &apos;t returned .
and there are things you need to know ,
things i need to tell you .
i &apos;m still at the algonquin but i &apos;m checking out today .
i hope you &apos;ll change your mind .
elizabeth fisher was staying at the algonquin .
who &apos;s elizabeth fisher ?
her name used to be evelyn ,
and she &apos;s my mother .
and just like that .
we get the mother of all questions .
chuck , how is that even possible ?
bart told you your mother died .
he also told me kids wear suits to kindergarten
and that blue chip stocks are great for birthday gifts .
he told me what he wanted me to believe .
chuck ran into a woman at bart &apos;s grave
and tracked her down .
she told us she was just one of bart &apos;s friends ,
but i guess ...
you okay , man ?
why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
you don &apos;t seem excited .
after all this time of thinking your mother is gone .
now you have a second chance .
a chance for what ? why even come back ?
she &apos;s here now . who cares why ?
i &apos;ve got a pretty good idea what her motivation is .
throw this away .
chuck , no .
serena , just--
you have no idea what happened 20 years ago ,
why she stayed away .
you have to at least let her explain .
no , i really don &apos;t . i &apos;m going to the bar for a drink .
if you &apos;re planning on doing any more sleuthing behind my back ,
i can leave you the combination for the hotel safe .
he &apos;s gonna be fine .
he &apos;s being crazy .
what are we gonna do ?
nothing .
you didn &apos;t see his face
when he confronted this woman .
and she sent him away . he &apos;s had enough pain in his life .
if he doesn &apos;t wanna hear her story ,
then i &apos;m gonna respect that , and so will you .
i &apos;m gonna take off .
i don &apos;t really feel like playing the scared boyfriend role .
no one &apos;s asking you to play the boyfriend role .
okay , lily , what &apos;s so important
that you couldn &apos;t tell me over the phone ?
well , jenny had a friend stay over last night ,
and i thought it would be a good idea for us to talk about it .
so how long have you and vanessa known each other ?
oh , we &apos;ve been best friends since we were kids .
i was actually talking to paul .
right . of course .
paul and i met at a cabaret last semester .
and the theme was fairy tales ,
so it &apos;s only appropriate that i met my prince charming .
actually , dan was prince charming .
where did you and dan meet ?
in the hallway , actually . he--
yeah , i was lost .
uh , this building can be very tricky when you don &apos;t live here .
let &apos;s go hit a beach ball around .
yeah . sure .
are we gonna talk about what &apos;s going on here ?
more drinks first .
i &apos;m sorry .
but ...
a blair waldorf apology without a caveat ?
sounds serious .
which is why i &apos;m here if you wanna talk .
or if you don &apos;t .
even if she is my mother .
she isn &apos;t .
it doesn &apos;t change anything .
the past belongs to the past .
i think we should go to bart &apos;s grave one last time ,
drop that off and never look back .
all right .
where do i even start ? how could you let this happen ?
i didn &apos;t let anything happen .
jenny is not serena .
and contrary to popular belief , children need boundaries .
dad , i ...
excuse me , sir .
the truth is , we fell asleep watching tv .
i know that sounds like &quot; teenage excuses for dummies . &quot;
i appreciate the fact that you &apos;re a concerned father--
you know the worst part of being the father of a teenage girl
is remembering when you were a teenage boy .
pack your bags , young lady . you &apos;re coming with me .
what ? where , dad ? i live here .
not anymore . it &apos;s back to brooklyn for you .
dad , you can &apos;t do that .
rufus ..
jennifer , pack your bags or i will .
okay , fine . i &apos;ll do it myself .
rufus , can we please talk about this ?
no , lily , we can &apos;t . you know , while she &apos;s packing her stuff ,
maybe i &apos;ll go grab what &apos;s left of my own .
where &apos;s melissa ?
uh , oh , she &apos;s salsa dancing . paul ?
she seems nice .
i knew this was gonna be weird .
what are you talking about ?
we &apos;re not really in a friendship groove here , dan .
there &apos;s too much pressure .
too much pressure ?
there &apos;s--there &apos;s no pressure .
hey , problem solved .
what could be friendlier than taking a mock photo ?
come on .
uh ... photo ?
huh ?
right . that was--
you know , it &apos;s--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s all these mojitos
and the confined space and the heat .
right . miami . um , so photo ?
yeah .
we come in peace .
whatever you need , man , we &apos;re here for ya .
we made reservations at kellari .
greeks know how to do comfort food .
what do you say ?
well , i guess i could use the walk ...
and some food in my system .
you sure we &apos;re doing the right thing ?
it &apos;s his mother .
you know chuck . he just needs a little push .
careful , s.
you may think you know what &apos;s best ,
but this time , you might just be pushing your chuck .
what ?
nothing . o @-@ our drinks would be nice ,
maybe some bread for the table .
you haven &apos;t eaten bread since middle school .
so , buddy , uh , how you holding up ? you good ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
no , it wasn &apos;t me .
we ... we called her .
we think
you &apos;re making a big mistake , one you &apos;ll regret
for the rest of your life . why not just listen ?
that &apos;s it . let &apos;s go .
blair , you know i &apos;m right .
no matter what he says now ,
he &apos;ll always wonder , and it will eat away at him .
chuck , she &apos;s here now , and she wants to talk to you .
whatever she has to say , it &apos;s better than not knowing .
fine .
oh , my god . i forgot our drinks .
no , melissa and i already grabbed some .
and we got to talking .
he was surprised to find out we just met this morning .
this morning ?
right before you called
and told me you wanted to get back together .
back together ?
how do you feel about salsa dancing ?
no , no , no . m @-@ melissa , please .
wait , paul . i @-@ i can explain . can you just wait one second ?
no , no need . we get it , even if you don &apos;t .
and whatever &apos;s going on between you two--
either do something about it or don &apos;t do something about it .
but , please , don &apos;t bring normal people into whatever this is .
this was a mistake .
i was brought here under false pretenses .
your friend serena told me that you know who i am .
&quot; friend &quot; is a pretty loose term right now .
they &apos;re talking .
see ? i knew if they got together--
shh ! eat your spanakopita .
i don &apos;t know where to start .
if it &apos;s all the same to you ,
why don &apos;t we skip to the end of the story ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry ?
what &apos;s he doing ?
oh , chuck .
i know why you &apos;re here .
yes , to ... to talk .
really ?
well , we &apos;ll see how much you want to talk ,
because ...
i bet it &apos;s not as much ... as this .
she ... she doesn &apos;t want the money .
she ... she won &apos;t take it .
she just wants to talk to him . i &apos;m going over there .
serena , sit your ass down .
no judgment , no strings attached ,
but one .
i don &apos;t want to know your story .
i want to know you &apos;ll leave
and never come back .
this is really what you want ?
i &apos;m sorry , charles .
you &apos;re right .
an expensive lunch , but it was worth it .
by the way , you were wrong .
what are you still doing here ?
do you want my dad to kill you ?
right . well , i assume you &apos;re not leaving without these .
i will be taking these , but ...
i actually came to say good @-@ bye .
okay .
well , good @-@ bye ... friend .
that &apos;s what you called me on the phone to your dad , right ?
so ?
so i &apos;m getting exiled to brooklyn
because of our relationship ,
and i don &apos;t even know if we have one .
jenny ...
you &apos;re in high school .
your father &apos;s not completely out of line .
okay .
you know , wait a second .
i &apos;m not gonna go write your name in a heart on my binder , okay ?
but you cannot expect me to start
world war iii with my dad
without even giving me something to fight for .
what difference does it make ?
your father won &apos;t let you see me again .
okay , now who &apos;s in high school ?
i fight with my dad all the time .
last year i ran away .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not afraid to stand up to him .
jenny ?
jenny , what are you doing ? jenny .
whose are these ?
they &apos;re mine .
watch your step , little j.
damien may be your drug of choice ,
but it looks like this love could be bad medicine .
look , i can explain .
oh , believe me , you will ...
right now .
did you know about this ?
no , rufus , i did not know about
a giant bag of pills .
jenny , what are you doing ?
i may be a bitch , but i &apos;m not a little bitch .
i told you i wasn &apos;t afraid .
are you taking these or selling them ?
i want the truth .
they &apos;re for a friend .
jenny , please don &apos;t make this worse .
okay , i don &apos;t get what the big deal is .
i know you didn &apos;t spend all those years
on the tour bus reading .
there &apos;s a huge difference between sharing a joint
with my bassist and getting caught
with a sack full of narcotics .
this is serious , jenny .
okay .
so let &apos;s just get it over with then .
am i grounded for life ?
military school ? what ?
probably both . this goes way past that , jenny .
see , i look at you and i don &apos;t see my daughter anymore .
the drugs don &apos;t belong to jenny .
they &apos;re mine .
actually , they &apos;re my father &apos;s .
chuck . chuck , wait .
you were looking for a fairy @-@ tale ending .
next time rent a movie . leave me out of it .
i just wanted him to have answers .
please . you and i both know why you did this ,
and it has nothing to do with chuck .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . i should go .
hey , i &apos;ll go with you .
nate , i need to be alone right now .
what do you mean , it had nothing to do with chuck ?
sorry , nate .
vanessa , hey . we need to talk about this .
what ?
our ... our kiss .
what &apos;s there to discuss ?
we both had about five too many mojitos .
why did you lie to me about dating paul ?
because i knew you had feelings for me ,
and i didn &apos;t want things to be awkward between us .
and if i was dating paul , then you
wouldn &apos;t get your hopes up .
oh , come on , vanessa , don &apos;t--
no , don &apos;t get all dan humphrey on me .
melissa ? really ?
all right , fine . y--fine . fine .
it &apos;s clearly not my best plan .
and i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t have lied to you either ,
but i was trying to protect our friendship .
i didn &apos;t want you to feel weird around me .
that stopped being an option
the minute you told me you had feelings for me .
i wish you &apos;d never done that .
i think i need another mojito .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll see you around .
so after my mother left , uh ,
i thought my father just wanted to have a good time ,
but , of course , you know , it escalated ,
and he started going on these benders .
one day he disappeared for two days . i thought he was dead .
and , uh , you didn &apos;t tell anyone ?
i had no one to tell .
i mean , my mother certainly wasn &apos;t an option .
then he came back in , filthy , with a broken arm
and no recollection of what had happened .
oh , my god .
the good news was i think it scared him enough
that he got sober .
and i got my father back ,
or least i thought i did ,
until i saw these this morning in his room .
that &apos;s why i came over here , to see jenny .
jenny &apos;s really been here for me lately .
and while we &apos;re clearing the air , i want you to know
i didn &apos;t spend the night in your home last night .
jenny was just trying to protect me .
by letting me believe that damien slept here ?
i was trying to distract you from seeing the pills .
yeah , i @-@ i still don &apos;t understand why you brought the drugs over .
i know it was completely reckless ,
and i &apos;m sorry for putting you ... and jenny in that position .
i ... i just thought ...
i--if i got the pills away from my dad ...
that everything would be okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
do you want to talk ?
or ...
no talking .
well , that was certainly a crazy story .
where &apos;d you get that , &quot; intervention &quot; ?
i ... i mean , it sounded so real . they totally bought it .
yeah , there &apos;s nothing to buy . it &apos;s ... it &apos;s true ...
oh , damien , they &apos;re upstairs . they can &apos;t hear you .
except for the part about my dad getting sober .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i had no idea .
no one does .
i &apos;d leave except i feel like if i disappear ,
he &apos;d have absolutely no reason to ever come home .
i &apos;m really glad you told me .
well , the pills have been flushed .
it &apos;s time for damien to go , and us , too , jenny .
just be happy you have a father who actually cares what you do .
thanks , dad .
i really liked damien , and he liked me .
you &apos;re young . you &apos;ll get over it . get your suitcase .
elizabeth ?
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i need to leave .
can i just have a moment of your time , please ?
charles was pretty clear about his feelings .
it &apos;s not for him . it &apos;s for me .
well , s . , looks like chuck &apos;s mom
isn &apos;t the only one with baggage .
my dad left when i was a little girl .
i don &apos;t know when or if i &apos;ll ever know why .
but i want to know why you left .
i know it must not be easy ,
but i don &apos;t think you would have come back
if you didn &apos;t want to tell your story .
i ... i was 19 when i got pregnant ,
nowhere near ready to be a mother .
we agreed i &apos;d give the baby up for adoption .
but i saw a picture of you holding chuck in the locket .
you ... you couldn &apos;t go through with it ?
no . it was bart who couldn &apos;t go through with it .
once he saw his son , that was it .
he even asked me to marry him .
you weren &apos;t married ?
oh , no . and i wasn &apos;t about to be .
i didn &apos;t love him . i told him that .
so he blackmailed you then ,
told you that if you left , you &apos;d never see your son ?
i &apos;m the one who told him to tell charles i was dead .
it was the only way i knew that he &apos;d never come looking for me .
and that way i could go on with my life
as if he never happened .
but you must have had regrets .
and--and knowing bart ,
he wouldn &apos;t have made it easy to come back . right ?
bart sent me money every year to keep me away .
but truth is ,
he didn &apos;t have to .
i didn &apos;t doubt my decision .
i know ...
this wasn &apos;t what you were hoping to hear ,
but now you know why it &apos;s better if i just leave .
my son wants to hate me .
i don &apos;t blame him .
you know , i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve known chuck my whole life ,
and he &apos;s better than
anyone i know at pushing people away .
i don &apos;t care what he says or does ,
but there &apos;s no child that doesn &apos;t want to know their parent .
dan .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
uh , yeah . yeah . excuse me .
look , you &apos;re right .
i lied to you about paul and then kissed you because ...
i have feelings for you .
i &apos;m scared , because i don &apos;t want to ruin our friendship .
and neither do i.
we &apos;re in this no @-@ man &apos;s @-@ land .
we aren &apos;t hooking up right now because we want to stay friends ,
but we aren &apos;t friends right now because we want to hook up .
no one is really winning in this scenario .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re being so cautious
that we &apos;re ruining everything .
we &apos;re hurting our friendship by--by not hooking up .
i think we should just throw down and see what happens .
if we go up in flames ...
at least we know we burned trying .
i &apos;m scared .
dad , i &apos;m sorry .
i know that i &apos;m probably grounded until i go to college ,
but ... please ,
is there any way that damien can have visitation rights ?
i understand that you like damien , jenny ,
but you can &apos;t see him anymore .
dad--
you lied to us to protect this boy .
and whatever &apos;s happening in his home life--
you know , i can &apos;t have you spending time
with someone mixed up with drugs .
lily , please . you get it , right ?
jenny , i &apos;m sorry . your father is right .
okay , you &apos;re just taking dad &apos;s side
&apos;cause you guys are in a fight .
this has nothing to do with lily and me .
really ? because lily &apos;s sleeping till noon every day ,
and you &apos;re spending your time hiding at the loft .
so just because you finally found something
that you guys can agree on , it
doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re right .
where are you going ?
i &apos;ll be waiting for you downstairs .
let &apos;s just get this over with .
i wish you and jenny would just stay here ,
and we could work through this as a family .
jenny needs a break from this world .
she needs to be back in her old room ,
her feet on solid ground . and i think i need that , too ,
at least for a while .
i &apos;m sorry for not telling you about elizabeth calling .
i wasn &apos;t trying to shut you out .
then what was it ?
i was hoping i could find out who she was
without ever knowing why she did what she did .
writing the check was just a test .
but i wanted her to pass , not fail .
as soon as i handed it to her , i didn &apos;t want her to take it .
it &apos;s the front desk .
hello ?
okay , patricia , hold on .
elizabeth fisher is in the lobby .
she wants to come up .
all right , you ready to go ? jenny ?
jenny ?
there comes a time
when every father learns you can &apos;t keep a bad girl down .
nate , what are you doing here ?
well , i thought you &apos;d be here . where &apos;d you go ?
um , i went to see chuck &apos;s mother .
why ?
because of my dad .
i &apos;ve been trying to find him .
i just want to talk to him ,
to understand why he left .
i &apos;ve come close to finding him .
i @-@ i tracked him down last summer .
but , um , he didn &apos;t want to see me ,
and he wrote me a letter explaining .
he was with my mother .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been avoiding your mom .
and i felt like somehow h @-@ his letter meant something .
you know ? but the truth is , he knows who i am now ,
and he hasn &apos;t come to find me .
i think talking to elizabeth
made me finally realize
that he just ... doesn &apos;t want to be found .
why didn &apos;t you tell me any of this ?
well ...
things have been so good with us , so fun .
i didn &apos;t want to bring any heaviness into it ,
you know , ruin things .
yeah , i mean , this time has been incredible .
i mean , we broke my dresser .
and i &apos;m enjoying every minute of it .
i just ...
i want to be that person you can bring anything to ,
the good and the bad .
me , too .
did you ever think that maybe ...
if that &apos;s the way your father feels , he &apos;s not worth finding ?
i know it &apos;s probably not the story you wanted to hear ,
but i wanted you to know the truth .
and i thought my father was the heartless one .
chuck .
you have every right to hate me .
but i want to be in your life .
for a price , of course .
i don &apos;t want this .
i thought it would be better if you could hate me ,
but i think it &apos;s better if you know me .
i &apos;ve decided to stay in new york .
i &apos;m willing to wait as long as it takes .
i want to know my son .
wait .
it seems like all that money ...
should at least buy you a drink .
i was worried that it wasn &apos;t gonna be as good without olivia .
yeah , it &apos;s almost like she brought us down ,
i @-@ i would say , if i had to grade us .
&quot; a &quot; -minus ?
all right . well , i was gonna say &quot; a &quot; -plus .
well , minus for the first time ,
due to the elbow incident , but after that , plus .
plus , plus , plus .
the reason , um ,
i was freaked out when you told me how you felt ,
was because with us , it feels like it &apos;s all or nothing .
yeah , i know .
if we hooked up , then it puts everything in fast @-@ forward .
like we &apos;d have to be married befire graduation .
all of our friends would be getting their first s.t.d.s ,
and we &apos;d be celebrating our first wedding anniversary .
so ... let &apos;s just take it one day at a time ?
keep being friends ?
yeah . as long as we can keep doing this .
you &apos;re gonna be in a lot of trouble .
yeah . well , you &apos;d better make my punishment worth it .
so my dad might have flushed your stash ,
but i raided lily &apos;s medicine cabinet .
she sometimes gets headaches .
it &apos;s a hell of a headache .
yeah . i figured we could go to the party
and you could maybe sell those instead .
or ...
we could skip the party .
and do what ?
rufus ?
no , miss lily . it &apos;s me .
is that rufus &apos; scarf ?
it was turned in , lost and found .
he wasn &apos;t wearing it today .
i did not want to say this , but dorota insist .
miss holland say ...
uh , rufus left this at her apartment .
i &apos;m sure he was just down there talking about rooftop garden .
thank you , vanya . i &apos;m sure that was it .
hey . it &apos;s me . serena .
i still don &apos;t know if this is your number ,
but i wanted you to know that ...
i &apos;m not looking for you anymore .
i thought maybe you wanted to know me .
but now it &apos;s me that doesn &apos;t want to know you .
i &apos;m done .
see you tomorrow .
enjoy your talk . call me in the morning .
thank you . i will .

what do you want to know ?

for now , at least .
