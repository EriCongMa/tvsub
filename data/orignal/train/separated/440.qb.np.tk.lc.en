you ok ?
yeah . i just need some fresh air .
i &apos;m going to , uh , i &apos;m gonna run around a little bit .
i &apos;m gonna be as good as new .
are we home ?
not yet , buddy . go back to sleep , ok ?
he &apos;s a goofball .
he fainted .
matt .
dad !
whoo , i got you .
my heart is racing .
what is it ?
car just stopped .
must be the battery .
stop fooling around .
no , i &apos;m serious . the car will not start .
at least turn the lights on .
mom &apos;s afraid of the dark .
no , i &apos;m not .
i got you .
i got you .
hi , hi , hi . sorry for the cryptic late @-@ night text ,
but i promised i &apos;d fill you in on the way here ,
and i am a girl who keeps her promises , so ,
this boy was found two hours ago
in the middle of nowhere .
technically he was found outside of crockett , arizona .
my point is , he has clearly been to super hell
and escaped some sort of captivity .
how do we know he wasn &apos;t just dropped off there ?
well , he has fresh cuts on the bottom of his feet
from the local cactus fields ,
and that &apos;s away from any through roads .
and his skin is rubbed raw around his ankles from chains .
he must &apos;ve had a chance to escape and he took it .
or the unsub could have had him in transit .
my god , you guys , look at his eyes .
yeah , he &apos;s jaundiced . probably hasn &apos;t seen daylight in a while .
yeah , and there &apos;s a lot of scars here .
and those are the ones we can see .
it &apos;s hard to tell for certain , but he &apos;s maybe 13 .
are there any missing children in the area , garcia ?
none until now , but , sir ,
you may have more information than i do .
i do . earlier tonight
another boy was reported missing in flagstaff .
that &apos;s not that far . it can &apos;t be a coincidence .
technically it could , but arizona
has the lowest abduction rate in the country ,
so the chances of these
cases not being related are ridiculously slim .
yeah . that &apos;s why child abduction rapid deployment
will meet you on the ground .
the flagstaff abduction is billy henderson , 13 .
his parents say he was coming back
from a friend &apos;s house after dinner . he never made it .
ok , they set up roadblocks , but the unsub has a head start .
right now our best chance of finding billy henderson
is to figure out what the first victim knows .
exactly . so , morgan , you and jj go to the hospital ,
see if you can get through to him .
the rest of us will set up at the police station .
losing his victim has likely enraged the unsub .
no telling what he &apos;ll do to billy .
no !
please !
please ...
please , no !
&quot; memory is a complicated thing ,
a relative to truth , but not its twin . &quot;
barbara kingsolver .
apparently billy was riding his bike home
from his friend &apos;s house last night .
they find the bike ?
no , the unsub was smart enough to cover his tracks .
and he has the guts to
take a good kid from a decent neighborhood .
billy left his friend &apos;s house at 8 : 20 p.m.
the ride home was less than a half a mile .
you &apos;re on speaker , garcia .
ok , i got the whole gang on .
it looks like the first victim
was definitely held in captivity in crawford , arizona .
why is that ?
because a woman walked in to crawford p.d.
this morning , says she remembers a boy
in chains , in crawford , 30 years ago ,
just like the boy found last night .
is she still at the station ?
no . she dropped that bomb of information and then she took off .
what &apos;s her name ?
her name &apos;s samantha allen .
most documents have her listed as sam allen .
36 , never married , born and raised
and lived her whole life in crawford ,
owns and operates a nursery , the plant kind , not the baby kind .
mother died when she was 5 , dad &apos;s a real estate developer .
is there security footage ?
yes . i &apos;m sending that to you .
it &apos;s on your tablets right now .
what &apos;s she looking at ?
i can &apos;t tell .
what happened ?
it looks like she was spooked .
dave , you and prentiss see if you can find samantha allen .
reid and i will get set up at the station .
all we can hope is that
morgan and jj get through to the survivor .
you can &apos;t examine the scars ?
i can &apos;t get close enough .
he has the most severe case of c.e.r. i &apos;ve ever seen .
conditioned emotional response .
i &apos;ve only seen it in vets .
that &apos;s worse than ptsd .
he had an adrenaline rush when he escaped ,
but coming down from that will be just as extreme .
and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s sensitive to light and sound .
incredibly . we &apos;re keeping it as quiet and dark as possible .
it &apos;s probably what he &apos;s used to .
he &apos;s also been somewhere cramped .
his legs show signs of advanced arthritis .
any idea how old he is ?
it &apos;s hard to tell . his growth has been stunted .
he &apos;s got major tooth and skin decay ,
clearly from a massive vitamin d deficiency .
best guess .
maybe 16 .
my name &apos;s derek .
i &apos;m one of the good guys .
and this is my friend .
i &apos;m jennifer .
you &apos;re safe now .
doctor says you haven &apos;t been eating much .
food looks pretty good .
you must be thirsty .
here you go .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
jj , this is years of conditioning .
have garcia go back to 2000 for missing kids .
yeah .
detective , i &apos;m agent hotchner .
detective perez .
this is dr . reid .
i thought your team was bigger .
the rest are following other leads .
is card retracing the escape route that the boy in chains took ?
they have been canvassing all night .
there &apos;s another team in flagstaff retracing
billy henderson &apos;s bike ride .
where are billy &apos;s parents ?
in the chief &apos;s office .
thank you .
detective , you talked to sam allen over here
and it looked like one of these photos upset her .
do you have any idea why ?
yeah , well , it &apos;s weird .
why is that ?
because most of these people have passed away .
that &apos;s our old chief .
that one there . he built the station
and some of the houses around here .
it &apos;s j.b. allen ,
sam &apos;s father .
hi there . can i help you ?
we &apos;re with the fbi .
we heard you were at the police station earlier .
oh . i told the other detectives , that was a mistake .
why did you leave the station when you saw your father &apos;s photo ?
i didn &apos;t .
we saw the security footage .
you told them you saw a boy in chains when you were a kid .
why do you think your father had something to do with this ?
he doesn &apos;t . i never said that .
my father is a good man .
this isn &apos;t about him , ok ?
i told the other detective , i made a mistake .
you know what i think ?
i think you saw the news coverage of that little boy
they found last night and it triggered something .
if you know anything that can help us
and you &apos;re keeping it to yourself ,
that &apos;s as horrendous as what &apos;s happening to those children .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i really , really am .
but i--i-- i can &apos;t help you .
come on , randy .
listen , i know how scared you are .
i know you think he can still hurt you ,
that he &apos;s just outside that door .
but i promise you he &apos;s not .
even if he was , he &apos;d have to get through me to get to you ,
and i &apos;m not about to let that happen .
so it sounds like billy &apos;s always been cautious .
he &apos;s our oldest . and he follows the rules .
it drives his little sister crazy because she &apos;s the opposite .
and he rides his bike a lot ?
all the time .
even at night ?
he &apos;s got lights and reflectors .
he even has a head lamp on his helmet .
we used to ride with him , but he &apos;s 13 .
he was only two streets over .
and you feel pretty certain
that he wouldn &apos;t go anywhere with a stranger ?
no . no way . never .
if someone asked for help , would he stop ?
hold on . are you saying that billy was taken because he &apos;s polite ?
i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s his fault
or yours .
billy is a cautious child ,
and that will be his strength right now .
she left after seeing a photo of her father ? did she accuse him ?
no , the opposite . she protected him .
garcia ran her mental health history .
she had some grief counseling
after her mother died , but other than that , no therapy .
we can talk to her , but we can &apos;t force her to help .
no , but something in her gut brought her in here .
if there &apos;s any truth to her instincts ,
there &apos;s gonna be some kind
of a record of a missing boy from 30 years ago .
well , have garcia check unsolved cases
and also check into j.b. allen &apos;s history .
we can &apos;t rule anybody out .
ok .
how are morgan and jj doing with the boy ?
he &apos;s so traumatized , he can &apos;t even speak .
give me everything you have on j.b. allen also ,
all of the unsolved missings .
you know what ? go back to 1980 just to cover bases .
thanks , garcia .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
what did garcia find out ?
she broadened her search ,
but nothing that matches his description .
somebody &apos;s gotta be missing this kid .
no , hey , hey , no . no , no .
that &apos;s not for us . that &apos;s not for us .
it &apos;s for the doctors outside .
it &apos;s for the doctors , not for us .
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s not for us .
there you go . come on back .
here . just take it .
there you go .
i , um , i got him to nod ,
but ... not much more than that .
and you asked him his name ?
yeah .
what about in spanish ?
it doesn &apos;t matter the language if he won &apos;t talk .
mi nombre es jennifer .
como te ilamas ?
what &apos;s your name , sweetheart ?
can i see what you have there ?
do you like eagles ?
yeah , the wings are-- are beautiful , aren &apos;t they ?
your back ? wings ?
wings on your back .
angel ?
is your name angel ?
so , softball , basketball , and soccer .
you played a lot of team sports .
was your dad a coach ?
no . he was always too busy with work .
i guess that &apos;s why he kept me busy .
it was ok , though .
the house was too quiet after mom died .
she had cancer .
i didn &apos;t really know what that meant growing up ,
just that ... she wasn &apos;t gonna get any better .
ok .
let &apos;s start with today .
what brought you in here ?
i saw that ... that boy on the news .
and i saw , um ...
i can &apos;t really explain it .
is--it was like a movie in fast @-@ forward .
it was dark .
so dark .
and that--that little boy ,
he had the same chains on his ankles .
and then it was over .
those flashes that i saw ... that boy ...
was he real ?
that &apos;s what we need to find out .
thanks , jj .
is the boy talking ?
no , but they figured out that his name is angel .
garcia sent a list of all missing kids since 1980
with a concentration in the southwest u.s.
most are runaways .
all right , let &apos;s eliminate the runaways and
focus on lower @-@ risk victims .
whoever &apos;s doing this likes the challenge .
here &apos;s the thing .
this unsub is too controlled
to let his victims escape .
i think angel must have gotten away
because he was being transferred somewhere .
i &apos;m running out of options here .
the state troopers are eliminating roadblocks ,
and card is coming up empty .
if j.b. allen is a suspect ,
why aren &apos;t we just kicking down his door ?
because it &apos;s too risky .
if allen is who we &apos;re looking for , he has a
psychiatric disorder that drives everything he does .
he &apos;ll do whatever it takes to hide billy ,
but he &apos;ll sacrifice him
if it means protecting his own freedom .
everything that this unsub does is methodical .
he had a secure place to keep angel for years ,
but when angel escaped , he didn &apos;t mourn his loss .
he drove straight to flagstaff .
the questions is , why did he choose flagstaff ?
he &apos;d only drive 60 miles out of his way
if he knew someone was there to make him feel better .
we don &apos;t think that billy was a victim of opportunity .
we think he was the target .
so this isn &apos;t a stranger abduction .
chances are he &apos;d seen angel before , too .
the question is , where would
he have access to both of these children ?
who should we be looking at ?
friends , neighbors , coaches , other parents .
we believe that this man has met billy before .
what ? you &apos;re saying
this son of a bitch watched my son ?
i &apos;m say he talked to him long enough to earn his trust .
but the other little boy , the one that you just found ,
i mean , why don &apos;t you ask him who &apos;s doing this ?
he &apos;s not talking to us yet .
oh , my god .
well , what happened to him ?
oh , my god !
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right . bring it over .
angel , that &apos;s pretty good , my man . you got it .
keep going .
ok , please tell me you found something .
i want to tell you that .
jj , there &apos;s not a single kid in the tri @-@ state area
who &apos;s gone missing whose name is angel .
i did a nationwide search . still nothing , zilch .
why wouldn &apos;t he be reported missing ?
you tell me .
there &apos;s a lot of undocumented workers in arizona .
yes , i know . i &apos;ve pulled harvest schedules already .
but what about school registrations ?
there are more angels than you think .
we think he &apos;s been held for a long time .
did any of them drop out during grade school ?
go back to at least 2004 .
2004 . 2004 ...
second @-@ grader angel suarez .
you got a picture ?
yes . and if i run my simulation software to age him 8 years ,
he &apos;d be the boy that &apos;s in the room with you right now .
it &apos;s him , jj .
you are amazing . thank you . can you send--
yes . send his mother &apos;s information to you right now .
you &apos;re the best . bye .
that sounded like good news .
i &apos;m about to call angel &apos;s mom .
he &apos;s responding to morgan .
it won &apos;t be long before he &apos;s talking .
ok , angel , the doc &apos;s here .
you want me to stay ?
all right , i &apos;ll be right outside .
ok .
hey , angel .
you &apos;re doing great .
your mom will be so happy to see you .
ok .
it &apos;s ok . we can start again .
i &apos;d like you to close your eyes . please .
close your eyes .
concentrate on your breathing .
ok .
you said it was dark .
you were in your pajamas .
yes . i was burning up .
you probably had a fever .
what did you do ?
i called out for my mom , but she wasn &apos;t strong enough ,
so i got into bed with her .
was your dad there ?
no .
did you hear anything ?
my mom &apos;s breathing .
was she having trouble ?
yes . it &apos;s a strange sound .
was there another noise in the house ?
there &apos;s something else , but i can &apos;t see anything .
i followed it .
my feet are so cold .
because you were outside ?
no . the basement .
i see him .
no , i was too scared .
no , no . i &apos;d go back up to my parents &apos; bedroom .
mommy . mommy .
but i peeked out the window .
and there &apos;s the boy .
what is he doing ?
he &apos;s trying to get out of that truck .
he &apos;s trying to get out of ...
your dad driving the truck ?
ok . no , no , no . he couldn &apos;t have done this .
you don &apos;t understand . he raised me in that house .
he couldn &apos;t have been doing that all these years . no !
ok . ok .
j.b. &apos; s friends with the whole town .
never remarried .
raised sam by himself .
that &apos;s why this is so painful for her .
she doesn &apos;t want to believe that he &apos;s capable of it ,
but her memory &apos;s telling her differently .
so you believe her ?
it &apos;s very hard to fake visceral reactions like that .
yeah , but she &apos;s talking about a time of serious trauma ,
on a night she climbed into bed with her dying mother .
that plus her age ,
it &apos;s the perfect storm for a recovered memory .
wasn &apos;t that a huge therapy trend in the eighties ?
a lot of women manufactured memories
of their fathers doing horrific things .
and misguided therapists
convinced them that their nightmares were real .
it was a huge waste of our resources .
i &apos;m , uh , just not sure about this .
i think she &apos;s credible
enough to warrant discreet rolling surveillance .
you &apos;ll have to use your own team ,
&apos;cause he &apos;d recognize members of this force .
if he has billy , he won &apos;t hesitate to get rid of him .
i &apos;ll get a card team member to join reid .
allen can &apos;t know we suspect him .
you know , if j.b. allen is our unsub ,
he certainly doesn &apos;t seem unhinged .
he went to the market today ,
and he stopped by his daughter &apos;s nursery ,
and right now i &apos;m watching him landscaping .
at his house ?
yeah .
is it isolated ?
incredibly isolated . there &apos;s a lot of land .
you remember what garcia sent us on j.b. allen ?
he started his contracting business in 1975,
married sam &apos;s mom that same year .
she died when sam was 5 , as we know .
he never remarried , and despite the newer subdivisions
he built , he stayed in the house he shared with his wife .
so he &apos;s either sentimental ,
or he didn &apos;t sell because he &apos;s customized the house
to hide his victims .
do you think angel blames himself ?
i know i did .
you know , seeing his mom for the first time
may not go well .
well , right now it &apos;s just about the shame he &apos;s feeling .
she &apos;s gonna have to realize
that he may not want to see her for a while .
aah ! angel ? angel !
angel , no , no ! angel , no , no !
angel , stop ! stop ! stop ! stop ! it &apos;s ok .
jj , get a towel . it &apos;s ok .
angel , listen to me . you &apos;re safe . you &apos;re safe . it &apos;s ok .
angel , you &apos;re safe .
it &apos;s all right .
please . he &apos;s right there . i have to . i have to see him .
i thought he was gone all these years .
my sweet boy .
don &apos;t you understand ? i need to hold him .
ok . listen .
angel hasn &apos;t been held in a very long time .
things happened to him .
he &apos;s going to have a hard time at first .
come on .
i know this isn &apos;t easy for you .
if i accuse him and he &apos;s done nothing ...
then i &apos;ve betrayed him .
but if he has , you &apos;ll save a young boy .
the best way for you to recover more of your memory
is to return to the source of the initial sensory trigger .
that was the basement .
how do i explain going down there ?
did he have anything of yours down there ?
yeah .
see if you can get it back .
help ! help !
help ! please help me !
i have to help my boy .
and you will . but first , we need your help .
someone else &apos;s little boy is missing .
we &apos;re trying to find out
how this man knew both your son and billy ,
and to do that , i need to know everything that happened
the day angel disappeared .
it was a tuesday , after school .
the children were in the front yard .
it started raining ,
but angel never came back in .
did you see anyone talking to them ?
no . no cars . nothing .
the neighbors--the neighbors helped me look .
i wanted to tell the authorities . i really did .
but--but we &apos;d have to leave the country
and i had to think of my entire family .
dios mio .
you just have to talk to him , sam .
you can do this .
right .
dad ?
you home ?
back here !
the yard looks good .
oh , thanks .
the kids at the store said you were going to phoenix ,
but i saw your truck down at the police station .
oh , yeah . their order for potted palms came in ,
so i just--i dropped it off at the station .
mm . chili . you want a bowl ?
it smells great , dad , but i can &apos;t stay .
since when ? it &apos;s my chili .
he &apos;s not trying to get her out of there .
not yet .
hey , is my old catcher &apos;s mitt still down in the basement ?
yeah . why ?
i was thinking about coaching softball down at the rec .
yeah ? that &apos;s great .
you still got the homerun record , you know .
yeah , i know .
that practice paid off , huh ?
is it , uh , it &apos;s still in the bin ?
yeah . let me get it .
no , no , no , that &apos;s ok . i got it .
uh--uh , i don &apos;t think so .
i got boxes everywhere .
i &apos;ve been trying to sort through some things .
i &apos;m thinking of having a yard sale next week .
you want in ?
sounds good , but come on . i can get it .
suit yourself .
he let her go down there .
yeah , but he hesitated .
he &apos;s not acting like he &apos;s got something to hide , emily .
that &apos;s how he &apos;s gotten away with it .
we don &apos;t know that .
you find it ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s right over here .
thanks .
told you it was a mess down here .
yeah . yeah .
you sure you can &apos;t stay ?
yeah . i &apos;m not feeling great ,
and i gotta get up early tomorrow .
you going to phoenix ?
uh , pickups , deliveries . it &apos;ll be a long one .
ok , then . see you later , peanut .
later , dad .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s ok . you did everything we asked .
there was nothing in the basement . i &apos;m sorry .
now all we &apos;ve got is the kid .
it &apos;s called a challenge coin , angel .
legend says an american pilot in world war i
was gunned down over germany .
and he crawled , across no @-@ man &apos;s @-@ land into french territory .
he was desperate to survive .
and he should have been safe ,
except that the french thought he was a german .
and he was almost executed .
but he showed them a coin .
it had his squadron &apos;s insignia on it .
it was given to him by a fellow pilot
so that they would never forget what they shared .
what happened to him ?
a french soldier recognized the insignia .
and they set him free .
angel , the man who took
you took another boy
and we have to find him .
can you help us do that ?
angel ...
i want you to have this .
it &apos;s kept me safe .
listen ...
carl buford .
that &apos;s the name of the man who hurt me .
i was just a young boy like you , angel .
and i thought about doing that very same thing to myself . i did .
because the shame was too much .
but instead ,
i kept the pain buried inside of me .
and it tore me apart .
but , angel , i never let that son of a bitch beat me .
i never gave him that .
i want to make this man pay for what he &apos;s done to you .
but i need your help .
i promise you that whoever hurt you will not win .
you and me together
can take away what he kept from you
and what he values the most , and that &apos;s freedom .
angel , please .
will you help me do that ?
yes .
can you tell us
if any of these men look familiar ?
no .
it was always too dark .
i &apos;m so sorry .
how do you feel ?
like i failed .
you didn &apos;t .
i failed him .
i actually thought he could have done all of this .
i think it took more than
a buried memory to come in here .
there is something about your father &apos;s behavior ,
things he has said and done
that have bothered you for a long time .
you buried those .
just like the memory .
look ...
you lost your mother when you were very young .
it would have been too devastating to lose your father as well .
repressing those memories is a defense mechanism .
so , um----
what else did i bury ?
his mood swings , probably .
do you remember when he was happy one day ,
angry the next ?
yeah .
and when his moods were extreme ,
did he give you gifts ?
how do you know that ?
what did he give you ?
a bike , once .
was that one that you had asked for ?
no . it was a-- it was a bmx .
any others ?
my catcher &apos;s mitt from today .
what did he do ?
you can tell me .
he used to ...
he used to bite me .
he hasn &apos;t for a while .
but he did ...
he did other things .
will you let the doctor take a look ?
maybe we can match dental records .
ok .
what about a few years ago ?
in 2004 , did he give you anything ?
that &apos;s the year he gave me randy .
randy ?
my--my dog .
he was just a puppy then .
guys , sam &apos;s father gave her gifts ,
trophies , from each abduction .
that &apos;s significant .
i didn &apos;t know that &apos;s what they were .
we need to find out
if angel had a puppy the day he was taken .
a puppy ?
yeah .
ohh ... that &apos;s right .
some of the neighbors were giving them away that day .
they had a whole box .
but i wouldn &apos;t let the boys keep one .
hotch , you hear that ?
yes . thanks , jj .
uh , wait , hotch .
um ... we &apos;re trying to get a dental match .
he &apos;s got old bite marks on him .
what is it ?
oh , my ...
my dad has his teeth recapped a few years ago .
he said something like , that &apos;s what happens
when you get older or whatever . he made a joke about it .
you better not give me any trouble .
no ! no !
we &apos;re heading to allen &apos;s house .
you think he &apos;s got a secondary location ?
he could , but guys like him
keep their victims close .
we &apos;ll search every inch of the property .
keep us posted .
will do .
jj .
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re going to find j.b. allen .
morgan .
angel said it was always dark .
he must have had him underground somewhere .
it &apos;s a big property . let &apos;s keep looking .
oh , god .
it &apos;s clear .
his truck &apos;s still here . he may be , too .
he wouldn &apos;t risk it . he &apos;s gotta have another vehicle .
i &apos;ll get the roadblocks back up .
any idea where he would go ?
someplace that feels like home . let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re on speaker , garcia .
so i tracked j.b. allen &apos;s property developments
over the last 30 years . they &apos;re all over the map--
well , of arizona , anyway .
sending it to you now .
hope you can make more sense of it than i can .
thanks , garcia .
the one thing that your memory
and angel &apos;s escape have in common
is he was getting rid of both boys .
he would only do that
if he had another boy waiting in the wings .
that means he met his victims before .
how ? i mean , they &apos;re hours apart .
look at the towns . he had subdivisions in all of them .
construction sites are a magnet for 10- to 12 @-@ year @-@ old boys .
he ...
he gave kids a ride on the backhoe all the time .
they would just line up for it .
oh , my god . i--
i--i didn &apos;t know .
we found his target @-@ rich environment .
the construction sites ?
yeah .
see if sam remembers a particular one
that he took her to frequently .
just one place ?
he keeps his victims for years .
the burial sites would be someplace special ,
and he &apos;d need a reason to revisit .
is there a favorite place your dad likes to go ?
you mean like the lake or something ?
no . most likely having to do with his work .
somewhere he &apos;s proud of ?
his first development .
where is that ?
in mesa . every few years he adds on to it .
he adds another house ?
he says that it &apos;s the place that reminds him how he got started .
it set the foundation for everything .
did you hear that ?
loud and clear .
please ! somebody ! help me !
help !
help !
no !
no ! no--

you &apos;re all right . you &apos;re ok .
morgan , that &apos;s enough ! that &apos;s enough !
are you ready , angel ?
yeah .
do you always keep them with you ?
yeah .
but the one i gave angel was
the only one that had wings on it .
you know angel &apos;s never gonna let that go .
what you shared , i know that wasn &apos;t easy .
none of this is easy .
i can &apos;t help but picture little morgan .
you were so alone .
i &apos;m here right now because of what that man did to me .
i know .
i &apos;m just ... sorry .
&quot; nothing fixes a thing so intensely in the memory
as the wish to forget it . &quot;
