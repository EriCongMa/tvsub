they are celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary .
i know . so ?
baby , you don &apos;t think they want to spend it together ?
looks like she fell from up there .
i &apos;ve talked to hundreds of victims
who &apos;ve lost their loved ones ,
but there &apos;s something about the way he &apos;s saying it ...
it just doesn &apos;t seem genuine .
20 @-@ plus years being a cop ,
and your instincts have never steered you wrong .
you &apos;re under arrest for murdering your wife .
leann stockwell .
women you &apos;ve been having an affair with ?
i talked to leann , clay .
she told me you wanted to leave your wife
and be with her .
you know , that &apos;s a great story , lou .
the thing is ...
you can &apos;t prove it .
he did this .
i know it .
how you holding up , by the way ?
i mean , i miss her already .
i don &apos;t blame you .
your aunt deb was a special lady .
she sure was .
well , that was kind of awesome .
well , north shore in january .
nothing comes close .
yeah , but today was especially good .
off @-@ shore winds , perfect overheads--
it doesn &apos;t get much better .
yeah , i &apos;d say it could get a little bit better .
what are you talking about ? you were smiling out there .
nah , he wasn &apos;t .
that was more like an anemic grin .
well , let me explain that , uh , &quot; anemic grin . &quot;
that is because you , my friend , are a wave hog .
excuse me ? i &apos;m a wave hog ?
that &apos;s right . wave hog .
the man has a point .
thank you .
yeah , you weren &apos;t , um ,
the most patient in the lineup out there , boss .
see ? you &apos;re a wave hog .
okay , fine . all right ? no , i &apos;m fine .
let &apos;s talk about this . you want the truth ?
you want to know why i was doing the party wave thing ?
it was for his benefit ,
in case he got into trouble .
oh . i see . i see .
so you @-@ you being a pig out there ,
stealing everybody &apos;s waves ,
that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s for my benefit ?
yeah , it was so you didn &apos;t drown , okay ?
listen to me . you want me on that wave .
you need me on that wave .
i see what you &apos;re doing there .
that &apos;s , uh ... he &apos;s doing jack nicholson .
he is .
it &apos;s good . and it &apos;s very appropriate , too ,
because the last six years of my life
have sort of been like the shining ,
which is a film that , if you &apos;d seen ,
you would know that jack nicholson
spends the whole movie torturing a young boy named danny .
like you &apos;re torturing me now ?
gentlemen , as much as i &apos;m enjoying this--
and i am enjoying this--
we should probably get going before traffic gets bad .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
wave hog .
party wave .
what &apos;s up ?
traffic &apos;s jacked already .
kamehameha &apos;s like a parking lot
from wahiawa all the way through pearl city .
we gotta take the 83 .
no , i don &apos;t want to take the 83 .
drive all the way around the whole island ?
it &apos;s a nightmare .
okay , we ...
it &apos;s another ... it &apos;s another half an hour driving
or another hour sitting in traffic .
what do you want ?
yeah , at least it &apos;s more scenic .
yeah .
i got a shortcut .
all right , i &apos;ll take the shortcut
if it gets me out of the car with him earlier .
we cut through the coffee fields in waialua .
wait a minute , the service roads ?
what , are you crazy ?
one wrong turn up there , we &apos;ll be back here .
it &apos;ll be midnight by the time we get home .
no , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a maze up there .
well , maybe for a haole .
but i used to ride those trails
on my dirt bike , when i was a kid .
hey , we &apos;re gonna be back home
before you guys even reach turtle bay .
cuz , i think you just threw down .
oh , oh , yeah , he threw down .
you care to make this interesting , my friend ?
what did you have in mind ?
little wager .
sure .
good .
first car to the palace wins .
the losers pay for dinner and drinks at side street .
how &apos; bout that ?
i like it . we &apos;re in .
whoa , hey , hey . cool your jets , turbo .
there &apos;s some rules in this game , okay ?
okay .
first one : no speeding .
okay .

and clay maxwell ordering giordano &apos;s
on a thursday night .
i would &apos;ve shared my pizza with you , lou .
you didn &apos;t have to go through all this trouble , man .
no trouble at all . matter of fact ,
we can end this thing right now .
all you gotta do is tell me you murdered your wife .
now , you know that &apos;s not gonna happen .
well , i got some bad news for you , brother .
i didn &apos;t fly all the way here for this deep dish .
i &apos;m here to get a confession out of you
and i &apos;m not leaving till i get it .
what happened to the rules ?
you made the rule , no speeding . what about that ?
i &apos;m sorry , have you seen a sign
since we left the park ? i haven &apos;t seen a sign .
let me explain something : just because you have a badge
does not mean you get to speed .
i &apos;m not speeding .
ok , you are a child .
just relax , all right ?
enjoy the view . look , it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s green .
what view ?
i got , uh , jet stream . there &apos;s no view .
do me a favor . pull over , would you ?
what , are you out of your mind ?
no , i &apos;m not out of my mind , i gotta pee .
can you please pull over ?
you didn &apos;t pee before we left ?
no , i ... that &apos;s why i gotta pull over , no .
and i &apos;m the child ? and i &apos;m the child .
could you stop the car for two sec - i &apos;m not stopping the car .
no . negative . i &apos;m not stopping the car .
you &apos;re unbelievable .
you don &apos;t even care-- i might get an infection
in my kidney and you don &apos;t care , as long as you get free wings .
i &apos;m getting drinks , too , okay ? all night .
i get drinks all night .
you cheap son of a bitch .
pull the car over .
i &apos;m not pulling the car-- here .
here , all right ?
i &apos;m not peeing in a bottle .
are you nuts , you animal ?
well , you pee out the window , then .
i &apos;ll hold on to the back of your pants .
how &apos; bout that ?
okay . that &apos;s nice .
wow , i haven &apos;t seen that in awhile .
seen what ?
that look on your face .
hau &apos;oli .
today was exactly what i needed .
thank you , cuz .
you know , we got guards looking out for him .
and with good behavior ,
this time next year , adam &apos;s gonna be home .
yeah .
yeah .
he &apos;s gonna be fine .
i know . i know .
speaking of significant others ,
what &apos;s , uh , what &apos;s up with you and abby ?
what are you talking about ?
are you serious ?
you guys are hooking up .
everyone knows .
what ?
what are you talking about , everyone ? who &apos;s everyone ?
everyone we work with .
it &apos;s that obvious ?
yes ! it &apos;s very , very obvious .
â€­ it &apos;s ridiculous .
all right , all right , all right .
not to be a bummer ,
but what happens when she goes back to san francisco ?
uh , yeah .
i &apos;m trying really hard not to think about that right now .
okay . okay .
so now we gotta get the variable to one side .
and remember , whatever we do on one side , we what ?
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s right .
we do on the other .
so we subtract .
now ...
you should have 16 = 4k .
therefore , &quot; k &quot; is what ?
that &apos;s my boy .
what &apos;d i tell you ?
what &apos;d i tell you ? you know what ?
your old man is good with numbers ,
but you &apos;re gonna be even better ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re smarter than me
and you &apos;re better @-@ looking than me .
yeah .
all right , listen ...
you have any more problems , you just give me a call .
all ri ... hey , hey , hey , hey .
no screens of any kind
till you finish all your homework .
all of it .
all right .
i love you .
all right .
i bet that hurt with that mustache , huh ?
you &apos;re crazy , man .
you know that ?
this is seriously messed up .
yeah , so &apos;s stepping out on your wife of 20 years
and throwing her off a cliff .
you are certifiable .
you need to let this go , man .
there &apos;s nothing you can do to change what happened .
and how am i supposed to let this go , hmm ?
how am i supposed to let go
of seeing my friend go in the ground ?
knowing that the man she loved ,
the man she trusted ,
a guy who used to be my best friend , put her there .
we have been through this .
i told you , i didn &apos;t kill diane .
yeah .
yeah .
you know , i &apos;m gonna turn this thing off .
come on .
come on , it &apos;s just me and you now .
no cameras , no recording , no nothing .
it &apos;s just you and me .
it &apos;s just two cops talking story .
you need a hobby .
you my hobby .
you know , i &apos;m no art critic ,
but this damn thing is terrible .
hey , wait a second .
didn &apos;t you have another pi ... ?
you used to have another picture up here .
you had a picture of you and diane on your wedding day .
what happened , your girl made you take it down ?
it made me sad to look at it , lou .
yeah , i &apos;ll bet .
where is miss sweet cakes , by the way ?
where &apos;s leann ?
she &apos;s out of town .
oh , well , that &apos;s too bad .
i was hoping i &apos;d get to see the look on her face
when you confessed to killing your wife .
i &apos;m afraid you blew your airline miles for nothing , lou ,
because that &apos;s never gonna happen .
yeah .
i kind of figured you &apos;d say that .
i gotta give you your props .
when you left hawaii , you moved real fast .
went right into damage control .
circled the wagons back here in chicago ,
got in front of things , got your little story .
what &apos;d you tell them ?
well , whatever cock @-@ and @-@ bull story you told them ,
they bought it , &apos; cause that blue wall went straight up .
nobody &apos;d talk to me. nobody &apos;d tell me a thing .
it took a few months ,
but eventually i had to wrap my head around the idea
that i was never gonna be able to nail you
for murdering your wife .
but you know me .
and you know i ain &apos;t gonna let you walk for it , neither .
and then it occurs to me .
hell , i don &apos;t give a damn what you go to jail for ,
as long as you go .
so i &apos;ll get you on something else .
i don &apos;t know what it could be .
but then i was cleaning out my gutters last week ,
and it hit me .
2304 kirkland avenue .
that address sound familiar to you ?
i &apos;m drawing a blank .
that &apos;s funny .
a stash house in little village .
we busted it five years ago .
yeah , well , we raided a lot of stash houses back then .
oh , not like this one .
see , this one , you was primary through the door .
and the perp drew a weapon . i don &apos;t remember what it was .
a nine or fn @-@ 5 @-@ something .
i don &apos;t remember .
anyway , he didn &apos;t give us a choice .
we filled him full of holes , and we dropped him .
when the smoke cleared ,
everybody split up to search the place ,
and lo and behold , what did you find ?
you found two bags ...
each with upwards of $ 250,000 in cash .
any of this coming back to you ?
it &apos;s starting to .
then you &apos;ll be wanting to hear the rest of the story ,
&apos;cause if you remember ...
... all the serial numbers on those bills were sequential .
well , i &apos;m sorry , almost all of them .
that is , until the money got turned into evidence ,
where they discovered a huge gap in the numbers .
you remember ?
everybody started talking about how there had to be
at least a bagful of that cash that went missing .
how could that be ?
and nobody ever found it .
but you know what ?
i think i know exactly what happened to that money .
so what are you thinking , i found the bags
and squirreled one away before you got there ?
well , if you think that &apos;s the case ,
why the hell didn &apos;t you turn me in ? !
because you were my partner . that &apos;s why !
i trusted you !
i &apos;d have believed any story ,
other than that one , to be the truth .
you murdered your wife .
now i see everything different .
so now i &apos;m a murderer and a thief .
well , we both know you &apos;re a murderer .
but a thief ?
yeah , you &apos;re a pretty exceptional thief .
maybe the best i &apos;ve seen in 25 years wearing the badge .
yeah , well , if i &apos;m that good ,
why am i still living in hyde park ?
why ?
because you &apos;re smart . that &apos;s why .
you move to the gold coast . that &apos;s gonna look suspicious .
so you stay here ,
living with this horrible art in this neighborhood .
the same neighborhood where everybody sees you ,
everybody knows you , and as far as they &apos;re concerned ,
you &apos;re still the same neighborhood guy ,
same stand @-@ up guy , old stand @-@ up clay .
you have got some vivid imagination , lou .
yeah ?
yeah .
and just where do you suppose i put this mythical money ?
safety deposit box ?
you &apos;re too slick for that .
you &apos;re too careful for that .
no , i think you &apos;ve got that paper
hidden right here in this house .
more to the point ...
... i think they &apos;re right up in some of these walls .
you remember that do @-@ it @-@ yourself project
that i came over to help you with ,
when you put up the new drywall in your basement ?
and then you got the bright idea
to hide some of your poker winnings
behind that drywall .
you even had a stupid little name for it .
&quot; yeah , man , this is my ...
my &apos; break drywall in case of emergency &apos; fund . &quot;
you remember that ?
i remember that .
so you &apos;re in luck .
i ain &apos;t gonna need any confession .
that money &apos;s gonna lock you up .
and i &apos;m gonna find that money
if i have to break every wall in this house ,
starting with this one .
this doesn &apos;t look like a coffee field .
check the gps again .
i can &apos;t . i have no signal .
okay , go ahead , say it .
i was not gonna say that steve was right .
i swear .
i was thinking it about 15 minutes ago
when you passed that hoop pine for the fifth time ,
but i &apos;m kind of over it now .
oh , you &apos;re so funny .
oh , yeah , and you &apos;re gonna be picking up the side street tab
unless we get out of here soon .
you see that car ?
maybe they can navigate us out of here .
well , they can &apos;t be far . the engine &apos;s still warm .
over there .
looks like there &apos;s a clearing .
what &apos;s he doing ?
hey , jeremy !
looks like we got some help .
okay , i think you already checked there .
watch your mouth .
you &apos;re wearing his ring too .
isn &apos;t that nice ?
let &apos;s have &apos; em .
don &apos;t give it to him .
she can give &apos; em to me , or i can just take &apos; em .
one way , she bleeds .
it &apos;s okay , chin .
yeah .
where are your wallets ?
they &apos;re in the car .
if it &apos;s as nice as your woman ,
i &apos;m gonna enjoy riding that .
me , too .
all right , put &apos; em to work , little brother .
let &apos;s go .
get in , it &apos;s your time to dig .
get in !
grab a shovel . you too .
get in !
you &apos;re wasting your time , lou .
even if i did take that cash ,
you think i &apos;d be dumb enough to hide it in my house ?
yeah .
yeah , that &apos;s exactly what i think .
breaking and entering .
assault , kidnapping .
you know you &apos;re gonna go to jail for this .
yeah , well , it &apos;ll be me and you .
i got dibs on the bottom bunk .
you think this is funny ?
i wish it was .
oh , well .
back to work .
you lying son of a bitch .
it &apos;s leann .
i thought you said she was out of town .
all right , smart guy .
you better listen to me very carefully .
if you give a damn about that woman ...
... you &apos;re gonna want to do
everything i tell you to do .
or what ?
you gonna kill us ?
clay ?
you keep saying
that i &apos;m crazy .
see , that &apos;s the thing about crazy people--
they don &apos;t know they &apos;re crazy .
see , i left my wife and my kids
on an island in the middle of the pacific ocean
to fly on a plane for nine and a half hours in coach
to get a confession from a guy
who i know is never gonna confess to me .
and now ...
now i got a gun to your throat .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m crazy ,
but if you don &apos;t give me what i want ...
i swear i &apos;m gonna burn this place to the ground
with both of your dead asses in it .
clay , you home ?
i &apos;m here .
where are you ?
hey , babe .
i had to run an errand .
i &apos;m sorry , i should &apos;ve told you .
i saw your car outside .
figured you were here .
well , the block heater broke .
she wouldn &apos;t start , so i took a taxi .
why don &apos;t you meet me at finn &apos;s for a drink ?
if you get there before me ,
just order me the usual .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you there .
all right , i love you .
oh , love you , too .
hello ?
hear that ?
hear what ?
silence .
silence is the sound of victory , my friend .
chin and kono are not here .
we beat them , which means ...
winner , winner , side street dinner !
you &apos;re such an idiot .
you &apos;re pathetic .
i &apos;m pathetic ? you peed in a bottle .
please don &apos;t tell anybody about that .
where you going ?
i &apos;m gonna go get the bottle-- i left it in the car .
okay , that &apos;s disgusting .
i need one of you to come with me .
i &apos;ll go .
but you got to promise me nothing happens to her .
you do as i say , and nothing will .
where are we going ?
just move .
all right , all right .
to the trunk .
who is he ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
well , he &apos;s not just gonna climb out of there himself .
let &apos;s go .
he &apos;s a cop .
he &apos;s what happens when you put your nose
in other people &apos;s business .
now move .
your brother &apos;s not gonna make it-- you know that .
what the hell are you talking about ?
prison .
i know a guy who went in for manslaughter .
within six months , they found him hanging in his cell .
you know , you , you &apos;ll be fine .
but your brother ...
he &apos;s not you .
well , i guess we &apos;re gonna have to not get caught then .
how long you think you &apos;ll be able to keep a secret ?
i think you better shut up .
just trying to help .
that &apos;s far enough , cop .
drop it .
drop it !
or the next one won &apos;t miss .
what &apos;s up ?
you hear from chin or kono yet ?
no . why ?
well , &apos; cause they &apos;re not answering their phones ,
and they should &apos;ve been here by now .
maybe they , uh , got car trouble .
yeah , but ...
why wouldn &apos;t they answer their phones ?
well , that &apos;s what i mean . you know ,
you warned &apos; em about those service roads .
maybe they got car trouble
and they got no signal up there .
yeah .
well , if you &apos;re worried about it , we &apos;ll go up there .
we &apos;ll drive back up to north shore and find them .
you know what , let &apos;s do that .
all right .
drop him right there .
hey , dig .
everything all right ?
no , everything &apos;s not all right .
they &apos;re cops .
what ? wait , he told you ?
he said squat .
they got an undercover car back there .
what are we gonna do ?
just relax .
listen ,
it &apos;s not too late to change your mind .
you saw my car .
the keys are in it .
there &apos;s no way we &apos;ll be able to follow you .
i don &apos;t want you to talk .
i want you to dig .
now .
and make sure there &apos;s room enough for three .
this is , this is ridiculous .
they could &apos;ve taken any one of these roads .
yeah , then we take them all until we find them .
boy , you got to be a real dumb ass ,
using your badge number for your safe combination .
yeah , well , at least i didn &apos;t use my birthday .
yeah , i tried that first .
remember these ?
your wife &apos;s rings ?
what &apos;s the matter , you didn &apos;t have time to go pawn them yet ?
how many times i got to tell you ?
you &apos;re not gonna find what you &apos;re looking for , lou .
it doesn &apos;t exist , never has .
it &apos;s here .
it &apos;s here and i know it .
i feel it in my gut ,
just like i felt it when i knew that you murdered your wife .
and i &apos;m gonna find that money ,
and when i find it ,
i &apos;m coming up here ,
and i &apos;m lighting a big , fat , cuban cigar
and smoke it with a smile on my face ,
and then i &apos;m going right down to cook county criminal court ,
and watch them perp walk your black ass
tight up them steps !
so you hold onto that , partner .
defense lawyers don &apos;t come cheap .
there &apos;s no getting through to you , is there ?
no penetrating that thick skull of yours .
man , after all this time ,
you still don &apos;t have one shred of proof that i killed diane .
doesn &apos;t that tell you anything ?
please ! you had a woman on the side !
you &apos;re sleeping with this girl ,
and telling her you &apos;re gonna leave your wife for her .
and now your wife &apos;s dead !
and now you &apos;re with her !
so that tells me something .
been over that .
what i told leann was ...
pillow talk , yeah . ...
pillow talk , right .
i was never gonna leave diane .
yeah , not the easy way .
let me ask you something , partner .
if i was thinking about bailing on my marriage ,
don &apos;t you think i would &apos;ve called my best friend first ?
talked to him about it ?
anything big ,
anything important ,
we told each other .
like philly , for example .
what &apos;d you say ?
anybody ever say anything about what happened there ?
say something else about philly .
say something else about philly ,
i swear , i &apos;ll knock out all your fronts .
don &apos;t you ever bring that up again .
struck a nerve while i was making a point .
because we shared things in confidence .
we were each other &apos;s priests !
if i was gonna leave my wife ,
you would &apos;ve been the first to know .
yeah .
would i be the first to know
that you planned on pushing her off a cliff ?
you have an answer for everything , don &apos;t you ?
are you done ?
no , go ahead .
swing your hammer .
take this place down to the studs .
rip up the floorboards .
hell , you can burn it down to the ground for all i care ,
because after all this ,
nobody &apos;s ever gonna believe
that you might &apos;ve been right about diane .
run !
hey ! come here !
leann , get out of here !
run !
hey ! come here !
help ! help !
let her go , lou !
clay !
i got her ! i got her !
leave her alone !
let her go !
i got her !
clay , help me !
shut your mouth . shut your mouth .
we are gonna find them .
yeah .
what &quot; yeah &quot; ?
that &apos;s twice now that you &apos;ve said that .
what ?
&quot; yeah . yeah . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s you pretending to be me , is that what that is ?
yeah , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s you doing me , all right ?
doom and gloom does not suit you , all right ?
look , i @-@ i can &apos;t help it .
at the moment , i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t stop thinking
that maybe this has got something to do with gabriel .
would you stop ?
just stop .
they &apos;re probably sitting on the side of the road
with their car , uh , broken down ,
they can &apos;t use their phone , no cell service , all right ?
i understand that your instincts are telling you
that things are terrible-- because that &apos;s who you are--
but let &apos;s be positive .
that &apos;s all , positive .
leave her alone , lou .
i &apos;m sorry i have to do this to you .
what do you want from us ?
he still thinks i killed diane .
i told you , he &apos;s obsessed .
aah ! you &apos;re hurting me .
you should have stayed at the bar .
you were fine at the bar .
i didn &apos;t want to get you involved in this .
just do as he says , leann .
he &apos;s digging his own grave .
one count of kidnapping &apos;s not good enough for him .
he wants to double @-@ down , so let him .
listen to me .
you &apos;re wrong about clay .
you gotta let this go .
please , leave us alone .
clay did nothing wrong .
leann ...
i got a wife .
i got a beautiful wife and two beautiful kids .
i got a lot of friends .
i got a big fat pension .
i even have an honorary membership
at the waialae country club .
i &apos;m really blessed .
and you think , with all that ,
do you think i &apos;d just throw that into the garbage ...
if i had even a scintilla of doubt about what he did ?
he didn &apos;t ...
you know he did it .
he killed his wife .
on their anniversary .
he pushed her off a cliff
and watched her head crack open on some rocks .
for you .
what are you gonna do when his game just rewinds ?
what are you gonna do when he finds the next leann ?
will he do the same thing to you ?
i &apos;m gonna leave you two now .
you look like you could use a little alone time .
don &apos;t let him get in your head .
you know me , baby .
you know i would never do anything like that .
all right , you &apos;re done .
drop the shovels and get out .
move ! move !
you too , sweetheart .
go ! let &apos;s go ! move !
turn around .
turn around !
