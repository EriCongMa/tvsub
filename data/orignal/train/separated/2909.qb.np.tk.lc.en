do you realize we &apos;re getting married in four weeks ?
four weeks , baby . four weeks !
you realize you get louder each week ?
there &apos;s still so much to do ! have you written your vows ?
i figured i &apos;d just buy those . &quot; pat , i &apos;d like to buy a vow . &quot;
you know i &apos;ve no sense of humor when it comes to this .
right . have you written yours yet ?
no , but i know what i &apos;m gonna say .
do you happen to know what i &apos;m gonna say ?
let &apos;s do it now . it won &apos;t be hard .
say what &apos;s in your heart .
look at her go . she must love me more than i love her !
what &apos;s wrong with me ? oh , don &apos;t open that door .
the one with the vows
&quot; monica , there are no words .. &quot;
there are no words ! this shouldn &apos;t be this hard !
you &apos;ve done this before . what did you say in your vows ?
with carol i promised never to love another woman until i die .
she made no such promise .
i &apos;m pathetic . monica knows what to say , you should have seen her .
what &apos;s the emergency ?
you have to help me write my vows . all i have is this .
i like the pretty drawing of you in the wedding dress .
thank you . -except your breasts look small .
those are my eyes !
those are my breasts .
oh , yeah .
why don &apos;t you start with something simple ?
&quot; monica , from the moment i met you i knew i loved you . &quot;
i can &apos;t do that .
everyone , this is chandler .
hi , i &apos;m ross &apos; little sister .
okay .
okay , okay . maybe you could start with :
&quot; chandler , even though we were friends ...
there was a part of me that knew i wanted more . &quot;
all right , there &apos;s a nuclear holocaust . i &apos;m the last man on earth .
would you go out with me ?
are we allowed to lie in the vows ?
okay , don &apos;t talk about those feelings .
just say something about ... all the things he &apos;s taught you , like ..
or all the things you taught him .
everybody knows the erogenous zones .
one , two , three ...
four , five ,
six and seven .
there are seven ?
that &apos;s one ?
kind of an important one .
i was looking at it upside down .
you know , sometimes that helps .
okay , start out with a little one ...
a two , a one @-@ two @-@ three ...
a three , a five ...
a four , a three @-@ two ...
two , a two @-@ four @-@ six .
two @-@ four @-@ six , four , two ...
two , four @-@ seven ...
five @-@ seven , six @-@ seven ...
seven , seven ...
seven , seven , seven ...
how about something like :
&quot; monica , when i look back over our time together ... &quot;
yeah ?
i can &apos;t do all of it .
look back over your time together .
oh , look , twins !
no fair ! i don &apos;t even have one , how come they get two ?
you &apos;ll get one .
yeah , when ?
all right , i &apos;ll tell you what
when we &apos;re 40 , if neither of us are married , what do you say we have one ?
why wouldn &apos;t i be married ?
i just meant hypothetically .
hypothetically , why won &apos;t i be married ?
no , no .
what is it ? is there something unmarriable about me ?
well ?
dear god , this parachute is a knapsack !
i &apos;m getting married today !
think he knew i was here ?
nice try .
wait , wait , wait .
look , monica ..
this is not gonna work .
i bet this &apos;ll work .
you are so great ! i love you .
what ?
i said you &apos;re so great , and then i stopped talking .
you said you love me !
no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did .
no , i didn &apos;t !
you love me !
no , i don &apos;t !
stop it ! stop it !
you know , i was thinking , what if i unpack here ?
then all your stuff would be here .
well ...
what if it was here ?
then you &apos;d be going back and forth all the time .
doesn &apos;t make any sense .
okay .
what if we live together , and you understand what i &apos;m saying ?
we wanted to surprise you .
oh , my god !
chandler ...
in all my life ...
i never thought i &apos;d be so lucky ...
as to fall in love with my best ..
my best ..
there &apos;s a reason why girls don &apos;t do this !
okay , okay , okay ! i &apos;ll do it .
i thought ..
i can do this .
i thought ...
that it mattered what i said or where i said it .
then i realized the only thing that matters is that you ..
you make me happier than i ever thought i could be .
and if you let me ...
i &apos;ll spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way .
monica ?
will you marry me ?
yes .
can we come in ? we &apos;re dying out here !
come in ! come in !
we &apos;re engaged !
yes !
hi .
what have you guys been up to ?
helping chandler write his vows . he kicked us out .
joey kept making inappropriate suggestions .
how is &quot; monica , i love your sweet ass &quot; inappropriate ?
how &apos;s monica doing ?
lucky she &apos;s got a sweet ass . she &apos;s not so good at writing .
in four weeks they &apos;re gonna be married !
let &apos;s just hope it works .
nine out of 10 marriages end in divorce .
that &apos;s not true .
you &apos;re right . how &apos;s the missis ?
i can &apos;t believe ... they &apos;re together 3 years .
that long ?
it seems like less because they hid it from us .

no . bye , then .
he wouldn &apos;t leave . he kept asking if i wanted chicken .
