there is ...
mr. new york . mr. broadway .
happy last day .
i made you this .
it &apos;s a bunch of pictures of you .
well , i had to take the necessary precautions ,
because the last time you left , you forgot who i was .
you called me jebecca .
well , thank you so much , jess . i really like it .
cool .
yeah .
well , that &apos;s a kick in the shins .
look , nothing personal , but , you know , i &apos;ve moved a lot ,
so i have this system that i use .
duffel bag full of essentials only .
and ... one jess cube .
you can &apos;t get rid of me .
look , jess , when i move , i make a clean break , okay ?
i &apos;m not going to get all sentimental .
and you promised you wouldn &apos;t make a big deal .
no , you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right . i promised you i wouldn &apos;t .
you did .
but ...
what about everyone else ?
showtime !
hit it , schmidt !
nick , where &apos;s your donald trump wig ?
it &apos;s here .
this was not my vision .
i specifically said &quot; dazzle . &quot;
you said &quot; razzle @-@ dazzle , &quot; and we said ,
&quot; we don &apos;t want to do that . &quot;
yeah , we told you this is not what he would want .
this isn &apos;t how men say good @-@ bye .
live from new york , it &apos;s coach &apos;s good @-@ bye !
yeah , show &apos;s over .
we ain &apos;t doing this ?
the system works .
remember , essentials only .
it &apos;s not just for packing ; it &apos;s a way of life .
you want to move forward , you got to get rid of the past .
that means throw out all your junk--
right ... emotional junk , actual junk .
got to make a clean break .
clean break . that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re blowing my mind right now , coach .
doesn &apos;t even mean anything .
or does it mean everything ?
i cannot believe you &apos;re all buying
into coach &apos;s crazy system .
you guys have fun with your clean break .
i &apos;m gonna go to my room , and i guess
i &apos;ll have to cancel the horse and carriage
that i hired to take you to the airport .
may and i are driving .
you are now .
you guys sure you &apos;re up for this ?
i am ready for this . i &apos;m single again .
i &apos;m a new man . i &apos;m leaving the past behind .
i want to get rid of my stuff ,
but all my stuff is really , really good ,
and i just can &apos;t get rid of it .
it &apos;s not , and you have to .
everything you own is trash .
you &apos;re basically a hoarder .
not true .
everything has meaning .
everything is connected to something else .
you need to be hard on yourself , okay ?
now , take this box and fill it up .
think i can do it ?
absolutely .
okay . i &apos;m gonna get hard and fix myself .
what ?
that &apos;s not ... no .
that &apos;s ... i didn &apos;t ... no .
oh , here we go .
the regis philbin crepe pan .
come on , coach . you can &apos;t give this away .
remember february 2014 ?
or , as we like to call it ,
crepe history month .
crepe history month .
it was a hot winter &apos;s night .
we were drunk , but our judgment was on point .
you hear that sizzle ?
let that sizzle speak !
those pancakes are paper @-@ thin .
there &apos;s only three left , so act fast .
this crepe pan ... is a knockout !
coach , we got to act fast . we got to act fast .
we got to act fast !
they &apos;re so thin !
you got to take the rege , at least for the memories .
the rege , man . the rege !
you know , i can &apos;t get rid of the rege .
psych !
can &apos;t get rid of the ...
i &apos;m getting rid of the rege .
memories are nonessential , all right ?
that &apos;s what makes the system work .
i found an ant farm full of candy wrappers .
is this essential ?
like , really , what do you think ?
hmm ? i need you to get harder , nick .
can you get harder for me ?
what ?
do you need me to get hard with you ?
i feel like you &apos;re not ...
meaning to say what you &apos;re saying .
talking about cleaning up .
schmidt , i think you forgot about this box .
oh , oh , that &apos;s cool . thanks , man .
i appreciate it .
oh ... you got a cece box .
so what ? it &apos;s not like everybody
hasn &apos;t seen your phylicia rashad box .
no , you hav ... you have ?
birthday card ...
don &apos;t .. please don &apos;t go in the cece box . don &apos;t do ...
... a crude drawing of ...
you and cece and your mixed @-@ race child .
yes , i painted that .
ooh , five dollars ! come to daddy .
this five dollars belongs in the box .
it &apos;s from the night that i first met cece .
looks like it &apos;s finally just the two of us , huh ?
oh , god , you &apos;re about to say something stupid , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
girl ...
and then i said something stupid ,
and cece made me put money in the douche bag jar .
what &apos;d you say ? you say you can flex
your butt cheeks like pecs ?
i bet you were all like ,
&quot; you &apos;re making my dong go crazy ! &quot;
i bet he said something chauvinistic ...
... that comes from insecurity
but ultimately leads to something endearing .
you know , it doesn &apos;t matter what i said .
nonessential , right ?
exactly .
so , good @-@ bye , cece .
may some poor street urchin
with a perfect 34 @-@ d
enjoy the sports bra that you left in my car .
we got to tell schmidt
that cece is in love with him .
right now , he is out there
throwing away all of his cece mementos ,
acting like he &apos;s just going to move on .
jess , i cannot watch this
when i know what i know .
i know .
we got to tell him .
i promised her i wouldn &apos;t get involved .
i always meddle . i &apos;ve learned my lesson .
she &apos;s trying to get schmidt out of her system ,
and we have to support her ,
even if it means letting her climb a mountain
with no prior knowledge or experience .
yeah , but does she know that schmidt and fawn broke up ?
is she getting our voice mails ?
i don &apos;t know . she hasn &apos;t called me back .
maybe there &apos;s no reception on the top of mount shasta .
we try again .
hey , cece , it &apos;s je ...
hey , yo , ceec , what up , fam ?
it &apos;s your girl winston , aka winnie the bish ,
aka @-@ ak @-@ aka brown lightning .
schmidt dropped fawn like a bad habit , okay ,
so ain &apos;t nobody riding shotgun .
so you better get on while the getting is good .
you got it ?
i hate that you &apos;re so good at this .
i was so nervous .
look at all this crap .
look at this .
&quot; associated strategies . &quot;
&quot; ass strat . &quot; what a joke .
more like &quot; butt strat . &quot; this place is total butt .
hey , jess , it &apos;s our sex mug .
what ?
what ?
oh ... nothing .
it &apos;s just a mug that nick and i used for sex .
oh , gross . like , in it ?
ew ! what ?
no . no , we used it when we were dating .
it was hard to find times
to be intimate with everyone around ,
so we needed to come up with a code .
just a way to let each other know we were aroused
without arousing suspicion .
that &apos;s wordplay .
it &apos;s also a free writing lesson .
when one of us left the mug on the entryway table ...
&quot; ass &quot; out meant it was time to ...
make love .
... bone .
yeah , make love .
we &apos;re getting rid of this thing-- especially since
you guys aren &apos;t using it anymore , right ?
right .
wrong .
i , winston l &apos;andre bishop ,
saw that very mug on this very hallway table
just last week ...
&quot; ass &quot; very out .
winston , that mug hasn &apos;t seen
any action in over a year .
you &apos;re off your rocker .
if i were off my rocker ,
would i take a weekly selfie with my cat ?
oh , winston .
you see , just last week , i took this selfie with ...
ait , not that one .
that &apos;s crazy . not that one . i forgot i had this one .
this selfie ,
in front of that table .
sex mug . question is , who put the mug out ?
all right , let &apos;s not play the &quot; who put the mug out &quot; game .
we should be focusing on coach .
i saw you checking out jess &apos;s butt last week .
no .
yes ,
she was wearing the &quot; look at me &quot; skirt .
all right , well , let &apos;s not try to ...
my money &apos;s on jess .
wait .
she hasn &apos;t had sex since ryan ,
and desperate times call for nick miller .
is the &quot; look at me &quot; skirt the green one ?
hey . do not change the subject .
you are implicating yourself
by changing the subject like that .
i put the mug out . okay ?
and , actually , nothing happened ,
and i regret nothing .
now , i &apos;m going to my room ,
and i &apos;m considering throwing out my sunglasses .
so long , old friend .
just doesn &apos;t feel right .
welcome back , old friend .
got a second ?
jess , we don &apos;t have to talk about it .
obviously , i was the one who put the mug out ,
so i wanted to thank you for covering for me .
no problem .
obviously , we &apos;re broken up ,
and it was ... a moment of weakness .
i didn &apos;t even know you put it out ;
i didn &apos;t see it .
oh ! no harm , no foul .
well ... we didn &apos;t bone .
no bone , no phone home .
great . so we &apos;re cool .
i &apos;m cool if you &apos;re cool .
fanterstic .
i &apos;m going to knit a scarf for coach .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll love it .
okay , bye .
thanks for the chat .
sayonara .
hey , nick , uh , do you want to know why i put the mug out ?
we &apos;re cool !
we &apos;re cool .
go knit that scarf .
no , no , no ! cece !
i want it back ! i want it back !
pop , pop , little bubble !
let that sizzle speak .
it &apos;s time to flip . care to do the honors ?
ah , sure , man . that &apos;d be cool .
rude .
winston , you &apos;re not gonna trick me into taking the stupid pan .
it stays behind-- that &apos;s the system !
clean break .
you know what , fine , coach , don &apos;t take it with you .
leave everything behind .
try not to remember anyone .
we are nonessential .
message received .
nah , coach , i don &apos;t think so .
because this crepe
belongs in the belly of someone with a heart .
damn it !
why are you so secure ?
you &apos;re filled with things that nobody wants !
oh . thank god .
hey , how are you ?
i dropped something in the bin , and i need it back .
you jewish ?
i just need a bo ... i just need a box .
i just can &apos;t part with you .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
you knit fast .
winston had fallen asleep polishing the candelabra .
i had just opened a bottle of pink wine ,
and then you showed up .
oh , hey . just working out .
got to sweep the temple .
damn ...
so , see , it wasn &apos;t my fault .
in your defense , i &apos;ve been working on my body ,
doing my burpees , and it shows .
i &apos;m not gonna do that again .
nick ...
warrior pose !
nick , is there anything that i do
that makes you think about putting the mug out ?
no , i @-@ i can &apos;t think of anything .
right .
it &apos;s just not the way that this old brain works .
clean break .
great . clean break . i agree .
jess , hold on . hey , hey ... h @-@ how is that ... ?
jess , wait !
yeah , i &apos;m stuck .
well , we seem to be in a bit of a conundrum .
how do i know this is your box ?
do you have any identification , &quot; cece &quot; ?
cece &apos;s my ex @-@ girlfriend ; it &apos;s a box of her things .
but i can tell you everything that &apos;s in there .
there &apos;s some paintings , erotic writings ,
there &apos;s a brassiere .
why would you have her brassiere ?
well , you know , she left it in my car , and i kept it .
she never asked for it back ?
okay , um , wally , look , it &apos;s a box of memories .
memories that i &apos;m not ready to let go of yet .
maybe if i could talk to cece ...
can &apos;t talk to cece ; cece &apos;s on top of a mountain .
look , i know this is unusual ,
but i need that box back , wally .
i need it back more than anything else
i &apos;ve ever needed in my life .
please .
does she know she &apos;s on the mountain ,
or is she being held there against her will ?
damn it , wally , give me the box !
no ! no !
no ! no !
wally !
stop blowing the whistle !
you &apos;re sexually safe !
coach , is that a bigger bag ?
my old bag broke , so i got a wheelie .
same system .
still only essentials .
is there a pan in there ?
that &apos;s not a pan .
that was just , uh , the sound of
two track pants hitting together .
you know , the buttons be like ... ting ... ti ...
but
yeah , since i got this new suitcase ,
i might as well take a few more things .
just to fill up space . know what i mean ?
just to fill up space .
like
take these glass grapes .
just to fill up space .
not that i want them .
of course not .
and this blanket .
for cushioning .
that smells nice ?
for cushioning , dude .
these mystery novels . take these .
not &apos; cause they &apos;re jess &apos;s , just because ...
i &apos;m an avid reader now .
stop smiling at me , man .
i &apos;m taking nick &apos;s workout jams .
cause , uh ... that one time i trained him ,
saw a lot of results .
i remember . he was so fat .
and i &apos;m taking this remote .
because you always hit the info button by mistake .
no , no , it &apos;s not by mistake , coach .
i like to know more about the cast and crew .
remote &apos;s gonna miss this tv so much .
our tv is gonna miss that remote .
smells like all our fingers .
jess .
do you really think
i haven &apos;t thought about putting this mug out ?
oh , i don &apos;t know , nick . you said it .
what &apos;s past is past . clean break .
think about my living conditions for the past year .
i live across the hall from my beautiful ex @-@ girlfriend .
and your living conditions--
you live across the hall from your beautiful ex @-@ boyfriend .
two true beauties .
so you have thought about it .
i &apos;m a man .
i am a human man .
interesting .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s always getting out of that shower
in that little towel , jess .
or you &apos;re wearing your glitter
or your pantyhose .
they &apos;re driving me crazy ! okay ?
i know how hard it is to get those pantyhose up ,
and i just ... i just sometimes want to rip &apos; em down .
just admit it , miller !
you &apos;re thinking about putting the mug down right now !
no . admit that you want me to be thinking about it .
i don &apos;t want you to think about it ,
so stop thinking about it .
we &apos;ll stop talking about it and then i &apos;ll stop thinking about it .
so , you are thinking about it ?
look , jess !
i &apos;m not not ...
... thinking about it .
hey , guys . want to know what happened to me today ?
we &apos;re kind of in
the middle of something ....
fine , i &apos;ll tell you .
i spent $ 500 to get back a five dollar bill .
go ahead , call me a fool .
you won &apos;t be the first person to call me that today .
you &apos;re a fool !
i need to move on .
i &apos;m never gonna get cece back .
and i know it &apos;s my fault that i lost her .
you lost her twice .
you had her ...
i know i lost her twice .
why would you have to ... ?
then you got her , then you blew it .
then you got her ...
who are you clarifying this for ?
are you sure you know how cece feels about you ?
yeah , i mean , she said a thousand times
that she only wants to be friends with me .
schmidt ...
jess , cece doesn &apos;t love me and she never will .
so i think it &apos;s time to let go .
nick , i want you to have this five dollars .
what ?
go buy yourself something special , like a burrito .
i love burritos .
i have to tell you something , schmidt !
i ...
but i can &apos;t tell you .
so , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll tell you . loophole !
nick ...
cece &apos;s in love with schmidt .
what ?
yeah .
for real ?
well ... also , winston promised ...
why are we talking about winston ? !
winston ...
cece loves me ! nick , we did it !
i got to go !
can &apos;t wait for cece to get back from her trip .
i &apos;m going after her . coach ...
i used to wish that you were uglier .
i don &apos;t wish that anymore .
i only wish you the best .
hey , you &apos;re the handsome one in the loft now .
big responsibility , but i think you &apos;re ready .
all right , you guys , i &apos;m off .
off to climb a mountain .
i &apos;ll see you in autumn .
winter at the latest .
good luck , schmidt .
yeah .
you go get her !
okay .
find that girl .
see you , schmidt !
bye !
cece !
cece .
so , i was , i was on top of this mountain ,
and i finally got cell reception
and there were , like , 20 voice mails from ...
are you in love with me ?
because i &apos;m in love with you .
deeply .
but i assumed that you would never because i &apos;ve ...
i &apos;ve messed this up so many times .
and you &apos;ve made it very clear that you just want to be friends
with me and i value that friendship so much .
so if i &apos;m ruining it by doing any of this ,
please , please stop me !
schmidt .
i &apos;m in ...
i &apos;m in love with you .
really ?
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s kind of stupid how much i &apos;m in love with you .
you should &apos;ve seen how fast i came down that mountain .
i mean , a lot of it was falling .
luckily , the ground just stopped me , but ...

looks like it &apos;s finally just the two of us , huh ?
oh , god , you &apos;re about to say something stupid , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .

probably a little bit impulsive , but it &apos;s not .

cece and schmidt are in my room .
oh , sure .
oh , cece &apos;s crying .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
it &apos;s everything that i &apos;ve ever wanted .

but now , it &apos;s a cat mug .
nothing wrong with us .
