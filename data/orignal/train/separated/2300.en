第二十集
You want to come with me to Storybrooke?
All I care about is a future where we might be a family.
Your were sisters once.
Just promise me you'll hold on to each other.
I think you have another love to find.
Hades.
Go to him.
You told her what?
To give him a chance.
And you thought that was a good idea because?
Because we're family.
And I'm trying to trust Zelena.
She thinks she can change Hades.
I'm sorry, luv,
I missed the part where Zelena changed.
You'd think the ex-pirate with a rum habit
would cut my sister some slack.
Well, you'd think that the Evil Queen
would be smarter than to send the Wicked Witch
to romance the most devious man alive.
Easy, guys. We're not gonna win the war against Hades
if we use all our ammo on each other.
The Savior has a point.
What the hell are you doing here?
Get behind me, kid.
Oh, I didn't find you to hurt you.
I came for your...
Wow, this is hard.
...help.
What could you possibly want our help with?
Simple.
I went to meet Zelena for our date
and found this.
No.
Zelena, she's been kidnapped by Gold and Pan.
They're asking for a meeting tomorrow morning.
Gold wants you to tear up the contract for his unborn child.
So, do it.
I just got my sister back.
I'm not going to lose her now.
Neither will I.
I'll give them what they want,
but I know the Stiltskins and their tricks.
They're not gonna keep their word.
Not unless I have an ace up my sleeve.
Luckily for you, you got one.
I'm sorry.
You've been Zelena's doting sister
for all of what, three hours? No.
Who's going to be more motivated than me?
Emma.
What? Why?
If Zelena gets out of this alive,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
Don't trust a word he says, Emma.
Now I agree with the pirate.
You and I both know
your family wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
If you help me save her,
I'll take everyone's names off their headstones.
So we can leave the Underworld.
So, what do you say, Savior?
Do you want to send your family home or not?
So, I just thought I'd ask on the off chance
if there's someone still working here
who remembers that baby being brought in.
26 years ago?
We can't keep a cook for six weeks.
Maybe, like, a long-time customer.
The food ain't good enough for that kind of loyalty.
Sorry, honey, but you're not gonna find anyone here
who remembers this.
Tough break, kid.
What?
Heard what you were asking.
You a reporter or something?
No, nothing like that.
You're the baby, aren't you?
From the article -- you're the baby, right?
Intuition. Mine's usually pretty good.
And I'm sorry.
It's hard not being able to find your family.
It's just a dead end.
I've had a lot of those.
So, thanks for your concern, 'but I got this.
Can I say one more thing based on my intuition?
Okay.
I look at you -- young, pretty...
Okay.
...and I see someone who now --
stop me if I'm wrong, but...
someone who stole money from a couple convenience stores in Phoenix,
got arrested, and took off on her bail.
Well, hello there.
Show yourself.
Glad to see you followed instructions and came alone.
Zelena.
I tried to stop them, but...
It's not your fault, it's theirs.
Oh, is that so?
Because we wouldn't be here
if you'd ripped up that contract when I asked you to.
You didn't have leverage.
And now I do.
So, you stand there and don't move
except to rip up that contract.
Then you get the witch.
There.
Now give her back.
Oh, you can have her back.
But we didn't say anything about her heart, did we?
You see, my body is ready to walk the earth again.
Except for one thing.
A living heart.
So, if you don't mind.
My heart has got a protection spell on it.
You may be good at magic, but we're better.
You sure about that?
I was beginning to think you couldn't get in.
Locks don't bother me much.
He ripped up the contract like you wanted, so leave.
Since when does the Savior answer to the king of Death?
Since he's the one getting my family home.
You picked the wrong team to back, Ms. Swan.
You won't get what you want from him.
Really? Because you just did,
which is making me wonder why you're still here.
Yeah, I suppose you have a point.
Rumple.
Looks like your little boy only came for what he wanted.
I don't think you're gonna be that lucky.
Zelena.
Are you all right?
You tore up that contract for me.
I didn't think you'd do it.
When will you believe I'd do anything for you?
I think I'm getting there.
Is that?
My heart. It's beating.
What the hell was that?
My banishment.
It's over.
I can finally leave this place for good.
Very soon, at the cemetery,
there will be a fully formed portal back to Storybrooke,
but it will close at sunset.
First things first.
I held up my end of the deal.
Now it's your turn.
We're going home through that portal, too.
All of us.
How'd it get here?
The hands are moving.
Is that a good sign or a bad one?
It's a great one if you want to leave.
When those hands spin fast enough in about an hour,
it'll turn into an open portal back.
Which we can't go through because of those.
So, let's get on with it.
Gladly.
There. As promised.
You're no longer tied to this realm.
I told you love could change him.
I don't buy it.
A man can't change that quickly.
We're free to go through the portal when it opens,
which means it's time to split my heart
so you can leave with us.
Aye, luv.
Do it.
Emma.
Mom!
Why didn't it work?
I told you we couldn't trust him.
That wasn't me.
I'm afraid there are laws of nature beyond even my control.
No, it should work. I died.
My wife's heart brought me back.
How long were you dead?
A minute or so, maybe less.
I didn't think I recalled you entering this realm.
Your soul never left your body.
That's why it worked for you.
So Hook's been down here too long?
And his body's rotting away up there.
Even if your soul could return to it,
I doubt either of you could stomach the smell.
Well, Emma, it appears you have to return without me.
There has to be another way.
Emma, please.
You're telling me no one's gone to the Underworld
and brought someone back?
They have.
Who?
Who did? How?
It was a long time ago, and it was a rumor.
There's no proof it actually worked.
Tell me everything.
Sorry about this,
but I'm gonna go take a shower now.
You gonna shower in that jajaet?
You probably sleep in that thing, too, huh?
Funny.
Sit tight, watch some cartoons.
I'll be right back.
Sorry, Tasha.
But I think your mom will survive.
Do you guys all get this special search thing?
Oh, I dated a guy once who's good at picking locks.
You could've left.
The Hancock County Courthouse has a file on me.
I didn't know that.
They could know something.
They could know the name of the boy who brought me in.
There -- there could've been a note with me
that was dropped into the file, something, anything.
You could take me there.
Why would I do that?
Because I can get out of handcuffs,
and you'll have to track me down in every city and every hotel
all the way across the country.
Look, if you help me with this,
I'll go quietly all the way to Phoenix.
I just want some answers.
You want to know where you come from.
Courthouse opens at 9:00 tomorrow.
Orpheus and Eurydice.
I know this myth.
She died, and he followed her to the Underworld to get her back.
These are the only two souls who ever escaped my realm.
How?
I thought you said that broke the laws of nature.
Orpheus helped Eurydice escape by feeding her ambrosia,
the food of the gods.
And where exactly do you get some of that?
'Cause I don't recall seeing it on the menu
at the Blind Witch's.
An elevator?
I'm the Savior. I've got magic.
And I'm the Lord of the Underworld.
That should tell you something.
The ambrosia, it's powerful,
and like a petty spoiled child,
it wants all the power for itself.
Everything else is shut down below.
There's no hopping in and out in a puff of smoke.
This is the only way,
and once you're down there, you're on your own.
And then what? We're knee deep in a field of ambrosia?
Can't be that easy.
I'm not really sure.
Even I've never ventured that far down.
So we're going to the one place in hell
where even the devil is afraid to go.
Not hell and not the devil.
And not because I'm afraid.
There's a test to ensure that only those
who are worthy of eating ambrosia can reach it,
and it will require offering up your heart for judgment.
Without magic, how am I gonna take out my own --
You're not.
My gift to you.
Take good care of it.
Let's have this be the last time we do this today, okay?
Just trying to help.
So, failing this test
has, what, fatal consequences?
One would think.
You don't have to do this, Swan.
And you didn't have to sacrifice your life
to save all of us from the Dark Ones.
We're going.
We'll be right here waiting for you.
Regina--
I know the drill.
If you're not back by sunset --
Everybody leaves, promise me.
You'll be back.
I love you, mom.
I love you, too, kid.
She may not accept you for who you are, but I will.
Despite your rude abandonment of me earlier.
Touching, Papa.
Yes, abandonment hurts, doesn't it?
But with the contract gone,
I only care about one thing --
getting Belle home so her father can wake her.
I'd love to help you make the journey.
But that's going to be quite difficult
since I didn't get the heart you promised me.
Oh, there's the man I remember.
Always thinking about what's in it for himself.
There's something in it for you, too.
Pandora's Box.
You can keep her safe in here in exchange for a heart.
Otherwise, you both might lose out and miss that portal home.
Opening soon, but only till sunset.
So, do we have a deal?
Tick, tock.
We can't just sit around waiting for them to get back.
We don't have a choice, Henry.
The minute Emma and Hook get off this elevator,
we're going straight through that portal.
What about Operation Firebird?
We can't leave the Underworld
without helping the people trapped here.
They were trapped here because of Hades.
Who, fortunately for them,
will no longer be a resident.
She's right.
The Underworld will function as it was meant to --
a place for people to deal with their unfinished business
without anyone getting in their way.
Yeah.
But a lot of the people down here
don't even know what their unfinished business is.
But maybe as the author, I can tell them.
What's going on?
Great. You got our message.
What are they doing here?
Hello to you, too.
Are you just gonna stand there,
or are you gonna let our darling daughter see her mommy?
Regina.
It's okay, Robin.
As hard as this is to believe,
they're actually helping us.
We both want the same thing --
to leave this place.
It's true. He took our names off the tombstones.
We can leave.
Well, then what are we still doing here?
Boy Scout's got a point.
We could take the baby to the cemetery now
and then all walk through as soon as it opens.
Not without Emma and Hook.
And Henry's right.
We can still help people.
Robin, take the baby to the portal.
No. I'm not leaving you in this place.
He may be playing nice,
but there's still plenty of people down here
that have a grudge against you.
Okay, then give the baby to Zelena.
Are you mad?
We can trust her.
Maybe you can.
Trust me.
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think it's what's best for your daughter.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
I just -- I need a moment.
Who's there?
It's just me, Dearie.
Don't worry.
You'll remember none of this.
Bloody hell. You all right, luv?
Looks like this is our stop.
How long could this take?
You take a file out of the drawer, you hand it over.
How hard is that?
Maybe I can motivate them to speed up.
Armor.
What?
My jacket, the one you like to ridicule.
It's my armor.
What are you talking about?
You're not thinking clearly. You're emotional.
It's what keeps getting you in trouble.
Can I give you a piece of advice?
You got to learn how to protect yourself.
Look, whatever we find here,
that ain't gonna be the end all be all.
Find your armor.
Miss, I have your file.
It's too thin.
It's the same damn article.
There's something on the boy who brought you in.
Looks like he ran away and fell out of the system.
The inventory of what I came in with.
I'm sorry.
Something's missing. Can you just take another look?
That's all there is.
Just look again.
Miss...
Okay, you know what? I can look.
Step back or I'll have to call security.
I can just look through the file!
Emma, It's a dead end.
You saw that folder.
Things could fall out of the folder and other things.
Come on, you're grasping at straws.
Straws are all I have! That's it! That's -- straws are it.
Calm down. You said you would go quietly if we did this.
We gave a day, we did it, now let's go, come on.
I'm not giving up.
Maybe you should.
But don't do it because we had a deal.
Do it for yourself.
Go back to Phoenix and start again,
looking front ways this time.
Once you've paid the price for everything you've done,
you can start building a new life.
You just want to drag my ass back to Arizona
so you can get the money for bringing me in.
I didn't have to give up a whole damn day
to do this for you, did I?
I kept my word, now you're gonna keep yours.
Hate me all you want, but tomorrow,
we are going back to Phoenix. Do you understand?
I understand.
Come on, kid. It's Arizona.
It's not hell.
Here you go, Stealthy, your unfinished business.
I hadn't realized how much resentment
I held against Bashful.
Thank you.
And, um, when you get back,
can you tell my brothers I miss them?
I will.
Y-you know, Leroy -- Grumpy --
he talks about you a lot.
Any sign of mom and Hook?
No, but we still have some time
before the portal even opens.
Don't count on it!
That's right, vermin.
Scatter!
Sorry, Cruella,
but I don't think your unfinished business
is going to take you to any place you'd like.
Oh, I'm not here to collect my story.
I want to stay in this marvelous realm.
You see, with Hades departing,
the Underworld is going to need a new ruler.
You?
It's the only upside
to your daughter sentencing me to this fate.
But the job would be meaningless
without a citizenry to torment.
Cruella, we're not gonna let you harm these people.
Oh, you think I'm just going to keep them here?
Oh, no.
I'm going to keep all of you here.
It's only fair,
considering it was your son
who refused to write me back to life,
and you, you dissolved my James,
the best toy in the whole playpen.
I'm still waiting to hear
how you're going to stop us from leaving, Fuzzy.
Because all your magic can do
is make a dog roll over and beg.
True. I don't have the magic
to keep you all penned in here.
But I do.
Out of the way, David.
You forced my hand, kid eater!
Regina!
What the hell?
That's right.
No one's getting out before sunset
when the portal closes,
and then no one's getting out.
Consider it payback, Regina!
For tricking those children into burning me in my own oven.
Oh, it's going to be a nice eternity after all.
At least for us.
The instructions couldn't be in English?
"Only a heart filled with true love can pass."
Seriously?
You'd be surprised what they teach you in the Royal Navy.
The only question is,
what the bloody hell does it mean?
I think I know.
I think I have to weigh my heart
to see if my love for you is true.
What?
Are you saying that what we share is...
Well, we're about to find out.
I know you love me.
But true love is the rarest magic of all.
Are you certain?
I mean, honestly, I'm not sure,
but who could be?
We have to try.
Why can you only admit how you feel
when one of us is facing certain death?
I don't know.
I guess my armor's been on for such a long time
that I...
Sometimes I forget I don't need it with you.
Here goes.
It didn't bloody work.
Emma, what's wrong?
The pedestal.
Get my heart off.
Killian.
Killian!
Get your heart!
What the hell is that?
That's true love.
Emma, you chose me.
That was the test.
Oh, God!
Geez.
Cleo, you scared the hell out of me.
What are you doing?
I know we had a deal, but I can't --
Yes, you can, and you will.
You want your bail money that bad?
Did you call security?
Do you think a security guard is gonna show up
and ask to see my license and give me my money?
Damn it.
All they're gonna see is two moron criminals
on government property asking to get shot.
Then why are you here?
Look, I'm sure that your parents
had reasons they gave you up, okay?
But you finding out,
what good is that gonna do you?
They would want you to focus on what you've got now.
How do you know what my parents would want?
Because I know things,
and sometimes you would do yourself some good listening to me.
Emma, look what I'm risking being here.
Come on, let's go.
This is the police!
Okay, come on.
Come out with your hands over your head!
Stand back.
I'll get your back.
No.
The ambrosia are dead.
And have been for some time.
Someone cut it.
Not somebody. Hades.
I knew we couldn't trust him.
Of course we couldn't.
Hades probably did this ages ago
when Orpheus and Eurydice used them to escape.
Then why lie to us?
Why send us after dead fruit?
Because he doesn't want us coming with him to Storybrooke.
I don't get it.
The Blind Witch's spells are always half-baked.
Unless this isn't her spell.
Hades.
He wants us trapped in here.
It's open now,
but it won't stay open much longer --
15 minutes tops.
They should've been here by now.
I don't know what's keeping them,
but we can't wait.
Zelena, we don't have time.
I can't leave my sister here.
We've done everything we can for your friends.
They're heroes. They'll get here in time.
Do you really think so?
Without me in their way,
what could possibly stop them?
All right, then.
Let's go.
Where have you been?
We're running out of time.
Still can't bring yourself to trust little Rumple,
can you, Papa?
You always were a touchy boy.
I take it that means
it's not going to be open much longer.
Shall we? Not quite yet.
Timing is everything.
Have patience, Papa.
There must be seeds or clippings
or something we could use to help save you.
Hades tricked us into coming down here.
There's no telling what he's done to your family,
or what he'll do if he reaches Storybrooke.
We need to get out of here.
Not without the ambrosia. It's the only way we can --
We'll find another way up, I promise.
But we have to go.
Blood. I didn't hear a shot.
It's not a shot.
Glass from the window.
I'm so sorry. I didn't --
An ambulance.
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be fine.
It's not an ambulance.
That's the cops. Don't get caught here.
They'll be able to help you.
And I'll call your family.
I have no family.
Your little girl.
I saw the picture.
She has no idea who I am.
What?
I took that 10 years ago from across the street.
You gave her up.
Just like I was.
You're holding on too tight.
Emma, let go.
Let go.
Over here! We got blood!
And they went this way!
Come on, we don't have that much time before the portal closes.
What?
I'm not going up with you.
I never was.
We're never gonna find anything up there to save me.
But you said --
It was the only way I could get you to leave that chamber.
No.
Killian, I came to the Underworld to save you.
I'm not going back without you.
I'm afraid we don't have that choice, luv.
Look.
I just want to say my goodbyes down here
without everyone watching.
No.
We've already had more time than we were ever meant to.
That's not true.
We both know it is.
You should have let me go in Camelot.
Don't make that mistake again.
I just...
I don't know how to say goodbye.
Well, then don't.
Just promise me one thing.
If I helped take off that armor,
don't...put it back on
just because you're gonna lose me.
I promise.
But then you have to promise me something, too.
Don't let me be your unfinished business.
Move on from here.
Don't wait for me to show up.
Aye, luv.
I think I can manage that.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Yes, sir, I'm on the trail.
You'll have your skip by tonight,
and then the next one --
Yeah, no, I know.
I know it's a trial period,
but you'll see I've got this.
I can do it.
Okay.
Oh, I got to go. Bye.
Hi. Can I help you?
Maybe.
Where did you get this?
So, it's you?
Tasha Morris.
I've never seen this picture before,
but yeah, that looks like me.
Am I in some kind of trouble?
Here's the thing.
I... knew your birth mother,
Cleo Fox.
Oh, my God.
I collected everything I could find about her.
I have access to some records from work.
I just thought...
you might want to know where you came from.
Is -- is she looking for me?
She's...
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Thank you so much.
Could you ring this up for me?
Yeah, of course.
I got to get to work.
Mom.
Henry.
Emma, where's Hook?
I'll explain later.
We have to hurry to get to the thing.
We can't.
The Blind Witch cast a spell trapping us here.
Let me guess, she got it from Hades.
This whole thing has been a setup
to keep us trapped in the Underworld.
You mean, the ambrosia -- - It wasn't there.
So, Hook...
he -- he can't leave?
He can move on.
But he wanted to make sure that we all got out
even if he couldn't.
Well, then, let's give him his wish.
Yeah.
You did it.
Come on, it's getting late.
Let's get out of here.
People will find them.
It's nearly time.
We should go.
We don't want to miss our ticket home.
Now...
are you ready?
Yes.
Thank you, son.
Pleasure's all mine, Papa.
Wait, something --
Wait, something's wrong.
Does it feel different than you remembered?
What's happening?
What did you do?
That wasn't really Robin Hood's heart
I put inside you.
I knew you or your shadow could be watching.
Whilst you were otherwise distracted,
I returned Robin's heart to him.
What did you put in me?
A wineskin I glamoured,
filled with water...
from the River of Souls.
No.
Why?
Villains don't get happy endings, Papa.
And I'm here to make sure you never get yours.
Goodbye, Papa.
For good this time.
The portal, it's closing! Hurry! Hurry!
Go!
Emma.
I'm sorry there wasn't some other way.
When I bought this jacket,
it was meant to be armor
to protect me from getting hurt by those I love.
But now it's just a reminder
that I have to protect those I love.
Nothing's more important.
You did your best for Hook.
I don't know.
Did I?
All I know is, I can't lose anyone else.
Let's go.
