i just saw kathy naked .
it was like torture .
if we go to war and you &apos;re captured , you &apos;re in for a surprise .
it keeps getting worse .
it bad enough that i &apos;m in love with my roommate &apos;s girlfriend .
by the way , i think she knows
every time we &apos;re in the same room , there &apos;s weird energy between us .
call me crazy , but i think she likes me too .
and now i have seen her naked .
at least with her clothes on i could imagine her body was covered in boils .
but there are no boils . she &apos;s smooth .
smooth !
could everyone see up his robe ?
oh , my god !
the one where chandler crosses the line
here you go .
i &apos;ll call you later.great !
hey , hey . who was that ?
casey . we &apos;re going out tonight .
going out ? wow !
it didn &apos;t work out with kathy ? bummer .
no , things are fine .
i &apos;m having a late meal with her after an early one with casey .
what ?
yeah.the craziest thing is , i just ate a whole pizza myself .
you &apos;re going out with kathy !
yeah . why are you upset ?
well , i &apos;m upset ...
... for you .
sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be unfulfilling .
what &apos;s the big deal ? it &apos;s not like we &apos;re exclusive .
look , joey .
kathy &apos;s clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs .
but , casey ....
granted , i just saw the back of her head .
but i got this sense that she &apos;s smart and funny ...
... and gets you .
you got all that from the back of her head ?
i think it &apos;s time for you to settle down .
make a choice . pick a lane .
who &apos;s elaine ?
little tony tarzan swinging on a nose hair swinging with the greatest of ease
swinging with the greatest of ease
i don &apos;t know the next verse .
you could just go : greatest of ease
then go right into it .
i like that .
how do you know about ... ?
you know , i used to play .
that &apos;s right . the keyboards ?
a little in high school . i got into it in college .
that &apos;s when i really found my sound .
orange juice just came out of my nose , but it was worth it .
oh , my god ! i completely forgot about your sound .
he &apos;d lock himself in the basement for hours .
no one was ever allowed to hear the sound .
i want to hear the sound .
no , i mean , i haven &apos;t played in so long .
well , it &apos;s really personal stuff .
play that funky music , white boy .
yeah , come on .
no , you guys.my keyboards are all the way
yeah , okay .
who wants to get dinner later ?
i wanna try that new ltalian restaurant.supposed to be really good .
saw a lot of chinese people eating in there .
what are you talking about ?
you said some restaurant must be good because chinese people were eating there .
that &apos;s because it was a chinese restaurant .
i still wanna go . who wants to come ?
oh , i can &apos;t . i got two dinner dates tonight , so i gotta get ready .
i gotta get ready .
all right , girls &apos; night out .
sorry , but we have to prep that catering thing for tomorrow .
oh , that &apos;s right.i wish i could eat in restaurants alone .
you should try it . it &apos;s a really good thing to do .
i just think i &apos;d feel really self @-@ conscious . like i was on display or something .
i was on display once . nothing like eating alone .
i just had a great time with myself .
well , this could be a good story .
at dinner .
it was so liberating .
you know , i don &apos;t need people to have fun .
i &apos;m fun . i &apos;m a fun girl .
are you a naughty girl ?
no , just fun . fun . good . fun .
see , i told you you &apos;d have fun .
i know .
although i must say that i totally judge any woman i see eating alone .
why ?
what &apos;s wrong with a woman eating alone ?
well , obviously something . she &apos;s eating alone .
okay , guys .
all right ! bring it on , you !
here we go .
you know , i &apos;ve never played my stuff for anyone before .
so it &apos;s important that you understand ... it &apos;s about communicating
... very private emotions .
you know .... you should think of my work ...
... as wordless sound poems .
that &apos;s what
oh , my god , play .
well , you know , that was ...
... terrific !
really ... bitchen .
wow ! it was so wow !
really ?
yeah ! i mean , you should play in public .
wow , thanks , you guys . that &apos;s
i want to play you another piece .
i left my helicopter sounds on another disk . i &apos;ll be right back , okay ?
this is so nice . i mean , i am so ....
god bless my dad for soundproofing the basement .
i can &apos;t believe i ever let him touch me with those fingers .
what are you guys talking about ? i loved it !
it was so moving .
it &apos;s so different from the stuff you usually hear .
you mean , music ?
i know what you think .
yes , yes , your breasts are just as firm and juicy .
come in .
oh , god ! is that baywatch ?
yes , but i just watch it for the articles .
so is joey around ?
no , he &apos;s not back yet .
come in , have a seat . bow or stern ?
i don &apos;t have a preference . you ?
i like it in the stern .
of the boat .
it &apos;s me . casey and l had a little car trouble .
what happened ?
we broke down .
i have to get transmission fluid .
tell kathy that i &apos;m sorry and i &apos;ll be there soon .
why can &apos;t you tell her ?
i think my time is about to
joey , joey
ya !
i thought your time ran out .
me too , but i guess i do have
joey &apos;s running a little late , and he says he &apos;s sorry .
i guess it &apos;s just you and me , then .
okay .
yeah , i think it is .
so , what &apos;d you do today ?
i had an appointment to cut my hair .
looks great !
and then it got canceled .
i could cut it .
really ? do you do that ? yeah .
i learned at my aunt &apos;s dog @-@ grooming shop . what do you say ?
dog grooming ?
don &apos;t make my tail too poofy .
you have really great hair .
oh , thanks . i grow it myself .
you know who also has great hair is joey .
yes , joey has great hair .
i &apos;m basically done here . let me get this hair off your neck .
what are you doing ?
checking to see if it &apos;s even .
looks good .
the phone ! the phone &apos;s making sounds !
hey , dude , it &apos;s me .
hey , it &apos;s joey !
it looks like we &apos;ll be stuck here .
i got the fluid .
the transmission wasn &apos;t there .
what ?
it fell out .
i just figured we hit a dog .
could you put kathy on ? i want to apologize to her .
it &apos;s joey .
no , it &apos;s fine . don &apos;t worry about it .
yeah , no , stop apologizing . it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
i should probably go .
i forgot my purse .
i really did . i forgot my purse .
this is bad ! it &apos;s bad !
horrible !
wait , the kiss or the situation ?
the kiss was good .
but that &apos;s bad !
here &apos;s what we do .
we forget it happened .

we swallow our feelings
even if we &apos;re unhappy forever . sound good ?
can you really do that ?
i have to . he &apos;s my best friend .
and you &apos;re seeing him .
chandler , i like joey a lot .
but with you
no , don &apos;t ! don &apos;t , see ?
you &apos;re getting me confused . i &apos;m starting to yearn .
i &apos;m sorry .
if you want to pretend that nothing happened , i can try .
i think we have to .

thank you very much !
hey , aren &apos;t you up next ?
i &apos;m not playing tonight .
why not ?
i can &apos;t follow ross .
it &apos;d be like those poor bicycle @-@ riding chimps who had to follow the beatles . no .
ross sucks .
the place has emptied because of him .
oh , my god , he &apos;s not even appreciated in his own time .
i &apos;d give anything to not be appreciated in my own time !
okey , pheebe .

you &apos;re awful .
you guys !
you suck too !
man ! i can &apos;t believe i locked myself out again !

no , this is amazing .
a tv that appears as if from nowhere !
that &apos;s the dream !

i &apos;ll fix you two up . what do you think ?
that all the pieces of my life are falling right into place .
you were really great . you were really , really great .
thanks .
monica tells me you don &apos;t want to play anymore because of me ...
... and , you know , my talent .
is that true ?
well , kind of , yeah .
i was trying to be really okay and upbeat about it ...
... but i just feel so dwarfed by your musical gift .
see , but ....
pheebs , that is the exact opposite intent of my music .
you know , my music is meant to inspire .
if it bothers you this much ...
... then i won &apos;t play anymore .
no , don &apos;t do that .
how could i live if i knew i was depriving the world of your music ?
yeah , okay .
i &apos;d love to , but i have plans on sunday .
well , maybe some other time.-sure. just give me a call , i &apos;m in the book .
okay . thanks a lot . see you .
what are you doing ? he is cute , and he &apos;s a doctor .
how do you know ?
honey , i eavesdrop because i care .
well , i have plans on sunday .
with who ? -me .
oh , god .
you are the one who told me how important it is to spend time alone .
i can &apos;t just go out with that guy when i have plans with myself .
wouldn &apos;t be fair to me .
so basically you &apos;re saying you don &apos;t want to cheat on yourself .
well , if you wanna make me sound crazy .
saw the new furniture . very nice .
joey has the best boyfriend ever !
i kissed kathy .
are you serious ?
does joey know ?
no .
is there any way you think he will understand this ?
you obviously haven &apos;t screwed over your friends .
which we all appreciate .
if you &apos;d told him how you felt before you kissed her ...
... knowing joey , he &apos;d have stepped aside .
don &apos;t say that ! that &apos;s not true , is it ?
yeah , he loves you .
then why didn &apos;t you tell me to do that ?
i said something to phoebe .
and i thought it was a really good idea.-yeah , i remember .
oh , my god !
what am i going to do ?
you &apos;ll have to tell him .
why do i have to tell him ?
because you do .
yeah , i know .
would it be okay if i wrote a song about this ?
i don &apos;t know if this is working out . i think ....
i think i wanna see other people .
wow . didn &apos;t see that coming .
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t enjoy this . i do .
i just wanna see what else is out there .
hey , guy . what are you doing here ? i work across the street .
lt turns out i &apos;m gonna be free sunday .
i wish you had called me.i just told them i &apos;d work this weekend .
okay , well , maybe next weekend .
definitely . i &apos;ll see you .
okay .
yeah , you &apos;ll be talking to me never , because you &apos;re a freak who eats alone .
sambuca margarita ?
it that a real thing ?
well , we only had sambuca , so it is now .
listen , joe . i need to i need to talk to you about something .
what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s about kathy .
i like her.i like her a lot , actually .
you do ?
yeah .
your timing couldn &apos;t be better.she &apos;s not my girlfriend anymore .
what ?
yeah , she broke up with me .
when ? just now , after acting class .
i thought she was doing some scene , so i let people watch .
man , i am so sorry . are you okay ?
i &apos;ve been better , but i &apos;m all right . so you like her ?
yes , but i don &apos;t have to .
no , it &apos;s okay .
yeah , you know why ?
because you came to me first .
i thought that would be the best thing to do .
you might have your work cut out for you .
when i talked to her , i got the feeling she &apos;s into some other guy .
see , that &apos;s actually what i wanted to talk to you about .
i think i know who the other guy is .
who ?
it &apos;s me.i &apos;m the other guy .
what ?
when you were late last night , kathy and i got to talking ...
... and one thing led to another , and ....
and what ? did you sleep with her ?
no , i just kissed her .
what ? that &apos;s even worse !
how is that worse ?
i don &apos;t know.it &apos;s the same !
there &apos;s nothing i could do . i think i &apos;m in love with her !
who cares ?
you went behind my back ? i &apos;d never do that to you !
i have no excuses . i was totally over the line .
you &apos;re so far past the line ,
that you can &apos;t even see the line ! the line is a dot to you !
yes , right ! and i feel horrible . you have to believe me .
oh , my god . is that why you bought all this stuff ?
you know what ?
i will not watch your tv.i won &apos;t listen to your stereo .
and there &apos;s a loaf in the new bread maker i won &apos;t eat . know why ?
probably because
it &apos;s all tainted with your betrayal !
this apartment is empty to me !
i &apos;m not happy about you either .
and just so you know ...
... i made that bread for you .
oh , my god ! he &apos;s lost it . he &apos;s totally lost it .
what ?
this cannot get any worse .
rats in the basement are hanging themselves .
thank you . thanks .
i lost it .
i won &apos;t play anymore.would you ?
can you finish my set ?
after that ? yeah .
no , i mean , if i can help .
yeah , like i could lose it .
