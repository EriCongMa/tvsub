i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen you this nervous before .
he &apos;s your brother .
welcome home .
come here .
and the entire time michael was in prison ,
he never let me visit .
i just never thought i &apos;d see the day
i &apos;m having breakfast with his cop girlfriend .
i &apos;m sorry to just drop in on you like this .
i &apos;m glad you did .
she says she &apos;s gonna text when she lands .
all right , this is her .
要在摩洛哥待久一点
change of plans -- she &apos;s not coming .
kono !
adam !
the guys who work for your brother are gonna want payback .
you need to leave .
i &apos;m going with you .
you can &apos;t be serious .
steve , don &apos;t stop her .
follow your heart .
i &apos;ll take good care of her .
i know you will .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
hey , that &apos;s funny .
you &apos;re the second mcgarrett we &apos;ve had here in 48 hours .
what do you mean &quot; second mcgarrett &quot; ?
doris mcgarrett .
you two related ?
you went to see wo fat .
now , why don &apos;t you tell me right now
why you would do something like that ?
why don &apos;t you tell me right now who he is to you ?
you want to know why your mother paid me a visit .
i can answer that .
but first , you &apos;re going to do something for me .
and what &apos;s that ?
you &apos;re going to get me out of here .
is that so ?
you set me up ?
yes , but not in the way you think .
they &apos;re not here to break me out .
they &apos;re here to kill me .
and you &apos;re the only one who can protect me from them .
from who ?
who are &quot; they &quot; ?
steve ?
steve , you okay ?
get wo fat to a secure location ,
then meet me at the palace .
this one &apos;s still breathing .
i &apos;m taking him in for questioning .
中国福州东部960海里
i spoke to chin .
told him we &apos;ll be in zhejiang province by the end of the week .
how &apos;d he sound ?
like a man who misses his best friend .
i &apos;d say we can turn around if you &apos;re having second thoughts ,
but ... somehow i don &apos;t think that &apos;s an option .
i &apos;m happy right here .
your whole life &apos;s in hawaii .
and i don &apos;t know if we can ever go back .
then we start a new one .
you and me .
us .
this is not what i wanted for you .
adam .
what happened with michael ...
you could have never seen it coming .
no matter how much distance we put between us , what happened ...
the memory &apos;s always going to be there .
i killed my brother .
i love you , cuz .
aloha .
malama pono .
time to go .
okay .
what &apos;s your name ?
we already got your prints .
you might as well tell us .
who are you ? who sent you ?
you &apos;ve got a bullet in your shoulder .
all right , you help me , i &apos;ll get you to a doctor .
thanks .
so , uh ...
i just handed wo fat off to the feds .
they &apos;re prepping him , getting him ready
for his transfer to a supermax in colorado .
did he say who was behind the attack ?
no , oddly enough , he wasn &apos;t , uh , feeling very chatty .
however , he did want me to commend you on your combat prowess .
he said that ?
no , it was more of a look .
so , what were you doing there in the first place ?
before she left , my mother went to see him .
i want to know why .
i &apos;m just taking a wild guess that he didn &apos;t tell you anything .
and doris is conveniently unavailable to give you an answer .
i have my theories .
i just hope they &apos;re not right .
chin , what do you got ?
steve , we got a hit .
the man you &apos;re interrogating is ricardo cosi .
he &apos;s known to be involved in drug trafficking ,
kidnapping for ransom , and murder .
he &apos;s linked to over 30
national liberation movement actions over the past decade .
this guy &apos;s nlm ?
i thought we were done with these guys .
apparently not .
ricardo cosi is terrorist royalty .
he is the nephew of an nlm leader stefan luna .
aka &quot; el condor . &quot;
so , that &apos;s why the nlm went after wo fat .
because he helped us get salgado .
and prevent the attack in san francisco .
now they &apos;re looking for payback .
this guy &apos;s got a blood tie to the nlm leader ,
it means he &apos;s gonna have some
serious intelligence value .
empty your pockets and step on through .
one at a time , please .
mahalo . next .
excuse me , sir . over here .
i &apos;m going to need you to empty your pockets .
everybody down !
everybody ...
on the floor !
face down !
face down !
don &apos;t make me ask twice .
let &apos;s go-- face down , face down !
get down .
hey , you ...
face down !
get down !
you two , come on , move , move , move !
don &apos;t do anything stupid !
come in , get on the floor .
shoulder to shoulder , don &apos;t be shy .
take out your cell phones .
cell phones !
hold them in the air .
heads down .
chin , hey , what &apos;s up ?
steve , we got a situation here .
what kind of situation ?
steve ?
chin ?
no service .
vamos , vamos , vamos , vamos , vamos .
gunshots were reported . get that barricade up now .
lock the place off . make sure everything &apos;s locked down .
captain grover ,
hell of a week to start a new job .
wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
welcome to hawaii .
what are our entry points ?
we got eight entrances and exits ,
all on the ground floor , and a fire escape in the back .
sergeant lukela , i &apos;m so sorry .
is anyone hurt ?
gunshots were reported ,
so there could be casualties among the hostages .
what about five @-@ o ?
far as we know , they &apos;re still inside .
you can &apos;t reach them ?
got no communications .
the phone lines have been cut
and they &apos;re jamming cell phone signals .
well , whoever they are , they know what they &apos;re doing .
we also confirmed that all the entrances
have been wired with explosives ,
so there &apos;s no easy way in or out .
like i said ,
not your typical hostage @-@ takers .
if these guys have locked themselves in ,
they won &apos;t get tired , hungry or give up .
they came to play .
hefei .
we are controlling every exit .
he &apos;s got to be with five @-@ o.
find them .
this goes down the same day we bring this guy in .
it can &apos;t be a coincidence .
it &apos;s got to be a rescue op , right ?
el condor wants his nephew back ?
oh , i &apos;m very touched .
this guy &apos;s leaking . he &apos;s not gonna make it .
sir ?
lieutenant , there &apos;s a situation at the palace .
i think you &apos;re gonna want to go down there .
they got every cop on the island out there .
good .
you told me you cleared all the offices .
we did .
it seems you weren &apos;t as careful as you thought .
i &apos;m trapped on the second floor in the offices of five @-@ o.
they cut all the phone lines .
they &apos;re jamming our cell signals .
i think there &apos;s more hiding in the basement .
please , they &apos;ll kill everyone unless you do something .
you got to help .
we got men here with guns , wounded hostages .
please , you got to help us .
i &apos;m trapped on the second floor in the offices of five @-@ o.
they cut all the phone lines .
they &apos;re jamming our cell signals . i think there ...
excuse me , brah . excuse me . excuse me .
whoa , whoa , that &apos;s as far as you go .
you got to let me through .
i got ohana in there .
and we &apos;re doing everything we can to get them out .
but right now , i need you to wait here .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry . let me through , brah .
sir , i &apos;m not gonna ask you again .
back off .
you even a cop , brah ?
i &apos;m in the academy , brah .
so move along before i arrest you .
you mean before you call somebody over to arrest me .
in three months , you better look out .
90 days .
i &apos;ll be waiting .
what are you gonna do ? you gonna shoot me ?
i considered it .
oh , you did ? well , do me a favor , then . put me out of my misery .
did you check the emergency exit ?
no , i went to get donuts .
yeah , i checked the emergency exit . it &apos;s not an option .
they got something rigged to the door .
it is not ... cop friendly .
steve ?
yeah , thank you . i see .
come on . come on .
buddy , we lose this guy , we got no leverage .
you &apos;re not helping , all right ?
okay . all right .
okay . come on . come on .
don &apos;t move . i &apos;ll be right back .
what &apos;d you say ?
now &apos;s not really the time . um ...
gabby , she &apos;s , uh ... she &apos;s in town .
all right ? and , um , for a minute there , i thought i was ...
i was actually happy . which is a weird thing for me
because i don &apos;t really know what that means , but ...
you know , i had forgotten about kono leaving .
i forgot about salgado and his son .
i forgot about getting shot at .
again . and then the phone rang .
i had to tell gabby i &apos;m going somewhere ,
so i turn to her , and i sit her down and i say ,
&quot; don &apos;t move . i &apos;ll be right back . &quot;
instead of what ?
i don &apos;t know . i figure i could &apos;ve said
something better than that .
okay , let &apos;s hear it for the boy scouts of america .
nice work , buddy .
what were you gonna ... what were you gonna tell her ?
you love her or something ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , maybe .
okay . well , you know what ?
maybe you should be sure-- how about that ? --
before you say something like that to a woman , okay ?
because once you say it , you can &apos;t unsay it ,
you understand me ? it &apos;s a serious thing .
i understand .
are you speaking from experience ?
because i personally don &apos;t think it counts
when you say it to a pistol .
we got to move .
get up . you , get up . up , up , up .
the drama continues to unfold at iolani palace
with dozens of law enforcement officers on the scene
of an apparent shooting and hostage situation .
there has been no official confirmation ,
but sources tell us , earlier today ,
gunfire erupted inside the palace
as several armed intruders forced their way in .
ah , great .
looks like you could use some help .
this has gone on long enough .
sergeant .
grover , what are you doing ?
my job .
seriously , what are you doing ?
where in the hell are you going ?
hold up ! hold up !
what &apos;s he doing ?
we &apos;re going in .
what &apos;s up ?
what do you want ?
you fellas hungry
or anything in there ? we &apos;re , uh ...
thinking about ordering chinese .
leave . now .
no problem . listen , if you ...
change your mind , though , let me know .
all right , gentlemen , we have three hostiles on the floor .
steyr tactical machine pistols and extra mags .
approximately 27 hostages on the horizontal .
let &apos;s get hot , guys . we &apos;re going in .
ricardo .
okay , fine . you were right .
it worked .
we got about 60 seconds
before they send somebody else down here .
come help me with this guy , will you ?
five @-@ o.
five @-@ o ?
listen to me .
you &apos;re holding our brother
ricardo cosi .
i &apos;ll give you one minute
to return him to me
or i start shooting hostages .
please .
just so you know ...
i mean what i say ...
you .
up .
up !
20 seconds .
ten seconds .
five seconds .
no . no .
on your knees .
i know ...
... there &apos;s more than two of you .
that &apos;s a really bad idea .
are you offering to go first ?
chin .
it &apos;s all over . get down here .
tomas ?
ricardo .
est bien
gracias .
you &apos;re free to arrest us now .
okay , gentlemen . weapons hot .
we &apos;re in position , captain .
we got movement .
steady .
take them to federal lockup , separate cells .
duke , call the fbi , dhs .
have them stand by for debrief .
commander , how did you get them to surrender ?
i didn &apos;t .
then how is this over ?
i don &apos;t think it is .
there &apos;s more wounded inside .
it &apos;s a through @-@ and @-@ through .
let &apos;s get two large bore lines in her , stat .
i need her heart rate and blood pressure .
gentlemen ,
so good to see you .
oh , we had you worried , max ?
not for a moment .
oh , you &apos;re a very good liar .
we appreciate it , though .
that &apos;s one scenario i hadn &apos;t figured on--
executing cosi like that .
that guy &apos;s el condor &apos;s nephew .
why go through all this trouble if
you &apos;re just gonna kill him once you get him back ?
cosi &apos;s blood tie to el condor makes him a liability .
he probably knew everything there was to know about this operation .
they needed to make sure he wasn &apos;t gonna talk .
all right , maybe i buy that ,
but then why surrender and risk becoming liabilities yourselves ?
where are they gonna go ?
place is completely surrounded , they got nowhere to escape to .
and let &apos;s keep in mind , these guys ,
they are well @-@ trained fanatics--
they have no problem risking their lives for their , uh ... mission .
i think this mission was more than just about cosi .
why ? what do you mean ?
when i was holed up in hq , there were two nlm soldiers
who came and grabbed data off our drives
before they destroyed the hardware .
what the hell were they looking for ?
all right , look , we got to move .
chin , listen , danny and i are gonna interview these suspects .
while we do , see what you can do about reconstructing the drives .
if we can find out what they were looking for ,
maybe we can work out what their next move is .
you got it .
catherine , we &apos;re fine .
oh , i am so glad to hear that .
who is this ?
i think you already know .
where &apos;s lieutenant rollins ?
she will be all right , commander ,
as long as you do exactly what i say .
take a deep breath and listen very carefully to me .
what i ask of you is very simple .
i get my people back ,
or your girlfriend will never be seen again .
don &apos;t do it , steve .
don &apos;t you dare do it !
catherine ! catherine !
don &apos;t do it , don &apos;t give them any --
what happens to her now is up to you .
you listen to me . this only ends one way ,
and that &apos;s with you dead , you understand that ?
i will call you back in ten minutes .
if my people are not free by that time .
well ... do i have to state the obvious ?
we got to move .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
no time to explain ; i &apos;ll explain on the way .
on the way where ?
swat commander . go .
we &apos;re heading eastbound on king street .
all right , swat van just made a left on king street .
we &apos;re gonna lose &apos; em . come on , let &apos;s go .
hold on , hold on .
could we have a little talk now , please ?
a talk about what ?
uh , i don &apos;t know , the weather ? i want to talk about what we &apos;re doing .
this isn &apos;t the best time , danny .
see , that &apos;s where i disagree . i think now is the perfect time ,
because i would like to be prepared .
i need to know what &apos;s going on .
i need to know if i need to put on some extra kevlar ,
need to know if i need to call my daughter
and say good @-@ bye for the last time .
we &apos;re gonna do what they asked .
we &apos;re gonna release the prisoners .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do , all right ? we talked .
please understand that i want to get
catherine back just as bad as you do ,
but how do we know they &apos;re gonna let her go
if we do what they ask ?
we can &apos;t .
that &apos;s my point ! it &apos;s stupid !
we can &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s not even stupid-- it &apos;s beyond stupid .
it &apos;s off the goof meter completely .
it &apos;s career @-@ ending , certifiably ...
okay , okay , will you stop ? listen to me .
i lost my dad dealing with people like this ;
i &apos;m not gonna lose catherine , too .
i @-@ i have your back .
always , okay ?
thank you .
there it is .
hold on .
grover !
out , out .
what &apos;s going on , mcgarrett ?
hands in the air . on your knees .
get on your knees !
don &apos;t move , don &apos;t move .
everybody out of the van !
out of the van right now !
out of the van !

weapons in front of you on the ground .
sidearms , too . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !

mcgarrett , what the hell are you doing , man ?
no time . i can &apos;t explain .
all right , get out .
out , out .
out .
go . get out .
so nice to see you again .
if anything happens to lieutenant rollins ,
you &apos;re the one i kill first .
can i ask you something ?
what ?
are the keys in the camaro ?
you know , you just lost your badge , mcgarrett .
you &apos;re all done .
you might be right about that .
all right , it &apos;s done .
you &apos;re a smart man , commander .
where is she ?
history doesn &apos;t have to repeat itself .
i had a feeling you &apos;d listen to reason .
i just did what you asked .
now , you tell me where she is .
let &apos;s go .
catherine .
catherine ?
catherine ?
catherine !
hey , catherine !
catherine ! this is it .
he said she &apos;d be right here . we &apos;ll find her . come on .
catherine ?
catherine , where are you ? catherine .
catherine !
steve .
catherine !
catherine !
steve .
catherine .
you okay ?
yeah .
you all right ?
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
all right , i &apos;m gonna go , uh ...
i &apos;ll go wait by the van .
if anybody needs me , i &apos;ll be over by the , uh ...
ow , wow , look at that-- that &apos;s a giant amakihi .
i thought these were extinct , no ?
you okay ?
yeah .
you all right ?
you shouldn &apos;t have let them go .
come on , i &apos;m not gonna lose you .
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yeah ,
yeah , i &apos;m good , but you let them get away .
that &apos;s what they think .
vámonos . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
i always figured your driving is
what would kill my car .
chin , you okay ?
yeah . they must have been expecting a tail .
this is terrible .
all right , did you see the other car the guys were driving ?
late model suv , black , no plates .
call lukela , have him put out an alert .
oh , you don &apos;t got to do that . you just ... tell him yourself .
all right , geez .
on your knees ! guns on the ground !
hey , hey , hey , hey ! hey !
down ! down !
hands where we can see them !
i had no choice . they had catherine .
and in exchange , you released four terrorists .
yeah , well , i had a plan .
oh , you had a plan .
well , where the hell are they ?
because all i see around here is an epic fail the size of texas .
easy , captain , before this gets out of hand .
look around you .
this has already gotten way past out of hand .
mcgarrett and his merry band
of do @-@ whatever the @-@ hell @-@ you @-@ want
should have considered the repercussions
before jumping me and my men .
look the only thing that got hurt was your pride .
immunity and means , my ass .
i want you and all your people
to put their weapons on the ground right now .
not gonna happen , all right ? this isn &apos;t the mainland .
it &apos;s hawaii .
we do things a little differently around here .
so , the more time we waste ,
the more time the nlm has to escape .
so , what do you want to do ?
those guys escape , that is on you .
um , you &apos;re invading his personal space ,
which is a bad idea .
you know , see this right here ?
we can do this later .
count on it .
yeah , good . i &apos;ll be there .
sure thing .
duke , we &apos;re gonna need air support and roadblocks now .
let &apos;s also call the coast guard , all right ?
anything up in the air
or in the water could be our guys .
duke , what &apos;s the matter ?
news chopper was reported stolen this morning .
didn &apos;t even register
with everything that &apos;s going on until now .
it &apos;s got to be connected .
h1 onramp &apos;s two blocks from here , right ?
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s where they were headed .
if the nlm is planning
on using this stolen chopper as a getaway ,
there &apos;s only one place i can think of
around here where they could land and take off again
without drawing too much attention to themselves .
all units be advised .
suspect vehicle is a black suv ,
possibly heading towards aloha stadium .
suspects should be considered armed and dangerous .
hold on .
both hands up !
hands where we can see them !
cease fire !
cease fire !
they &apos;re all dead .
we &apos;re missing one .
where &apos;s steve ?
vámonos ! vámonos !
vámonos ! vámonos !
you okay ?
yeah .
come on .
come on , superman . okay , you see ,
this is the reason i don &apos;t like to fly , because of you .
no , you don &apos;t like to fly &apos; cause you have a fear of fun .
this is fun to you ? this is you having fun ?
did you break anything ?
will you shut up already ?
someday i &apos;m gonna miss this .
all right , boys , listen .
we &apos;ve had a long day .
why don &apos;t we , uh , let hpd do the paperwork ,
and let &apos;s go grab a beer on me ?
yeah .
what about captain grover ?
we did our job .
he &apos;s got to get over it .
if he doesn &apos;t ?
then we got a problem .
what else is new ?
hold on . stop for a second .
did you say free beer ?
i did .
what are we doing sitting here ?
would you give me a hand up ?
oh , you want a hand now ? here , there &apos;s your hand .
give me your hand . come on .
come here .
you want to tell me
how you caught up with that helicopter ?
i was chasing el condor across the field
while his guy fired at me .
and then , just as they were getting away ,
they were taking off , i jumped up and i grabbed
one of the helicopter struts with my arm .
you know what ? forget about it .
commander , you &apos;re going to have to make this fast .
we &apos;re wheels @-@ up in five minutes .
i only need two .
coach is even worse than i imagined .
why don &apos;t you cut the crap ?
i just saved your life .
now , tell me , why did my mother come and visit you in prison ?
she came to apologize .
apologize for what ?
for killing my father .
you killed her husband-- my father--
and then you hunted her for 20 years .
why would my mother ever apologize to you ?
that is a question only she can answer .
i was afraid you were going to say that .
what are you doing , steve ?
what do you think you &apos;re going to find ?
the truth ?
you don &apos;t want to know the truth !
run this right away .
against what ?
my blood .
i want to know if wo fat &apos;s my brother .
whoa . this is some heavy stuff .
should i sign a confidentiality agreement or something ?
no , it &apos;s fine . you tell anybody
what you saw , i &apos;m gonna shoot you .
yeah . okay , that &apos;s funny .
i don &apos;t think he was kidding .
toast , focus .
oh , here we go .
these are the last commands
that came in just before the nlm
bad boys destroyed your baby .
looks like a search request for satellite data .
data which was then transmitted
to an unknown third ... party .
what is it ?
what were they looking for ?
hello ?
kono , it &apos;s chin .
listen to me very carefully . there &apos;s been a security breach .
your location has been compromised .
by who ?
the nlm .
we believe they sold your location to the yakuza .
you and adam need to get out of there right now .
chin ?
just do it , kono ! go !
who was that ?
we need to leave now .
what ?
don &apos;t pack .
don &apos;t take anything . let &apos;s just go .
