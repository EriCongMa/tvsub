yeah .

... and then come back again .
okay ...
three times .
oh , there he is .
hey , chin , get in on this , bud .
no , i &apos;m ... just gonna get a drink .
this double fudge is totally rocking my world , jerry .
seriously , dude , get in on this .
your taste buds will thank you .
i &apos;m going back to bed .
oh , come on , kelly .
just a couple spoonfuls .
yeah , kelly , come on .
all right .

i love having roomies .
1982年起专业清洁各种犯罪现场
it &apos;s all yours , hirsch .
hey @-@ o . second responder .
yo , dude , you didn &apos;t carry that
all the way up the stairs , did you ?
you know there &apos;s a dumbwaiter , right ?
no , i did not .
thank your uncle for not mentioning that .
yeah .
so , uh , what happened here ?
homicide . somebody popped the homeowner last night .
vanessa diaz .
poor thing .
her and her daughter sara just moved here
from mexico , a few months ago .
yeah , mcgarrett and uncle d think
the killer was waiting for her when she got home .
she fought him off , he chased her up here .
the house has a panic button .
she activated it , hpd got here in under four ,
but even then , it was too late .
dropped a net over the whole area ,
but still somehow , this guy slipped away .
what about the little girl ?
she was at a , uh , sleepover at a neighbor &apos;s house , luckily .
all right , i gotta bounce .
this house has video cameras everywhere ,
but there doesn &apos;t appear to be an ftp server on the premises ,
so the footage must back up to one off @-@ site .
anyway , i gotta go find it .
hopefully , the cameras caught something .
tag out .
all right .
all right , thank you very much .
all right , hirsch got a little bump on the head .
he &apos;s gonna be okay .
as soon as they let him out of the er ,
we &apos;ll sit him down with a sketch artist .
what are we thinking , buddy ?
okay , we are thinking that , uh ,
our killer heard the sirens last night ,
uh , figured he didn &apos;t have time to get out of here ,
so he dips into this room .
uh , he &apos;s thinking that he can lay low
until everybody clears out , uh , make an escape ,
but lucky for us , he runs into hirsch .
and lucky for hirsch , he didn &apos;t put
a bullet in him like he did the victim .
right , i &apos;m thinking that
he figured hpd was still in the neighborhood ,
didn &apos;t want to risk somebody hearing a gunshot .
all right , got a live feed of every security camera in the house
and a dedicated server ,
which means the footage wasn &apos;t uploaded
to an off @-@ site location , like i thought .
the backup was done here .
and unfortunately , the entire server &apos;s been wiped clean .
so no footage ?
no .
well , what about physical evidence ?
there &apos;s gotta be something .
no .
thanks .
you got it .
help me out with something .
there was 15 cops in this room earlier , right ?
including you and me .
never once did any of us guess that there was a safe room .
right . so how did the killer know ?
exactly .
right , so either
vanessa was on her way in here when she got clipped ,
or the killer had some inside information about this house .
i think it &apos;d be helpful to speak to the daughter .
where are we at with next of kin ?
hpd &apos;s working on it ,
but , uh , vanessa &apos;s got no relatives on the island ,
and as far as we know , sara &apos;s father is not in the picture ,
so it &apos;s gonna take a little time .
well , where &apos;s the kid ?
she &apos;s next door , at the neighbor &apos;s house ,
where she stayed last night .
um , hpd &apos;s gonna pick her up
when social services assigns a caseworker .
anybody told her about her mom yet ?
no , not yet .
speaking of people who need looking after ,
the killer saw hirsch &apos;s face ,
so until we catch this guy , he &apos;s gonna need some protection .
yeah , who &apos;s , uh , who &apos;s gonna be in charge of that ?
officer kalakaua .
when they told me i was getting protection ,
i was hoping you &apos;d volunteer .
i didn &apos;t .
you can thank mcgarrett for this .
i &apos;ll be sure to do that .
question , if it comes down to it ,
would you be willing to take a bullet for me ?
no .
but i might have to shoot myself to get out of this assignment .
hey , you ready to go ?
after you , my dear .
you first .
if you say so .
but , uh , no leering at the caboose .
you &apos;re supposed to be on the lookout for threats .
unless , of course , you want to .
oh , this is gonna be fun .
i know , it &apos;s a dump .
i used to have a six @-@ bed in kailua .
5,500 square feet .
wine cellar , infinity pool .
it was xanadu .
my own shangri @-@ la .
and then i met you , and it all went away .
so what &apos;s your poison ?
espresso ? cappuccino ? macchiato ?
just water .
really , hirsch ?
uh , where are you going ?
uh , i have to check the bedroom .
wait , is that absolutely necessary ?
because ...
oh , my god .
uh , i swear , that was here when i moved in .
all right , that &apos;s a lie .
but for the record , i painted that
long before you were ever engaged to what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name ,
back @-@ back when i thought you and i still had a future .
still ... creepy .
you actually should be flattered .
out of all the women i could have chosen as my muse ,
i chose you .
i &apos;m honored . deeply .
the sketch artist is on her way .
a sketch artist ? what for ?
so you can give a description
of the murder suspect .
the same one that put you in the emergency room .
my dear , save your money .
i can do the sketch .
thanks . we &apos;ll leave it to the pros .
i guarantee you i &apos;ll do a better job .
hirsch , a composite sketch
is not like one of your caricatures .
it &apos;s an important forensic tool .
we need to have the most accurate description possible .
and the sketch artist has ways
of helping people remember exactly who they saw .
honey , that painting of you in there ,
and all the other ones i keep in my clo ...
... done from memory .
trust me , i got this .
there are other paintings ?
there better not be nudes .
i mean , i got to admit ,
this actually looks like the work of a pro .
except for the part where he signed it .
&quot; to my five @-@ 0 @-@ hana .
all the best , hirsch . &quot;
what a putz .
anyway , we ran this composite through facial rec .
we struck out there .
but there was some good news .
eric managed to pull some of the suspect &apos;s dna
off hirsch &apos;s clothing .
and while the guy isn &apos;t in the system ,
we did get a hit on the same dna
on a couple of unsolved burglaries .
now , both these houses are on the north shore , upscale homes ,
and both of &apos; em hit within the last six weeks .
all right , so our suspect &apos;s a thief , right ?
uh , i &apos;m guessing this @-@ this was a burglary turned violent .
yeah , and we may have a lead already .
it turns out that our vic &apos;s house
and the two houses on the north shore
have something in common .
they were all on the market recently .
we think our prowler has a very specific mo .
he recons his targets by posing as a potential buyer .
that &apos;s smart , right ?
go to ... go to all the open houses , case the joint up close ,
check out all the security stuff .
that &apos;s how he knew about vanessa &apos;s safe room .
all right , good , let &apos;s get hirsch &apos;s sketch
to whoever held the listings for these houses ,
see if anybody recognizes this guy .
and ... lunch is served .
i got it . thank you .
what is this ?
oh , it &apos;s , uh , bronzed sea bass in a lemon shallot butter .
it pairs nicely with this ...
lovely chilean chardonnay .
uh , y ... you do get that i &apos;m working now ?
huh . i won &apos;t tell if you won &apos;t .
i &apos;ll stick with water .
if you say so .
more for me , then .
what ?
don &apos;t think i can &apos;t see what you &apos;re doing .
what am i doing ?
oh , come on . this whole setup ,
the lunch , the wine ,
you &apos;re totally turning this into a date .
that is silly .
yeah . go for gerard .
i see . okay .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
uh , thank you .
‭ everything okay ?
we gotta go .
what ?
date &apos;s over , toots .
i have an urgent situation downtown .
this is not a date , and we &apos;re not leaving the apartment .
i am . that was the retirement home where my father lives .
apparently , there &apos;s some issue .
if i don &apos;t fix it today , they &apos;re gonna throw him out .
okay .
fine .
gentlemen , uh , as the english statesman
and poet george villiers once famously wrote ,
&quot; ay now the plot thickens very much upon us . &quot;
oh , yeah ?
okay . what &apos;d you find out ?
well , during my autopsy , i found some fresh dna
underneath the victim &apos;s fingernails .
it appears that ms. diaz scratched her killer
during their struggle .
that &apos;s not an unusual thing , max .
that is correct , commander .
however , that dna was different from the sample that
detective williams &apos; nephew found on mr. hirsch &apos;s clothing .
okay , so what , there &apos;s , uh , two thieves ?
or two crimes .
please note , in addition to the bruises
that she suffered at the hands of her killer ,
she also sustained injuries that were consistent with cpr .
and furthermore , the dna that was found on mr. hirsch &apos;s clothing
was also found on your victim &apos;s lips .
our thief tried to save her ?
that is correct .
so that also probably means he didn &apos;t try to kill her .
maybe he &apos;s on a job
at the time that the killer and vanessa came back to the house .
right ? he doesn &apos;t want to get involved ,
so he hides in the safe room .
he comes out when he tries to help ,
and then , uh , then he goes back in when hpd shows up .
well , if that &apos;s the case ,
our burglar probably saw her murder on the monitor ,
which means that we have an eyewitness .
an eyewitness who will do anything he can not to get found .
well , now that max &apos;s autopsy
has revealed no sexual assault ,
i &apos;ve been digging around in vanessa &apos;s background
to see if i can figure out why somebody would want her dead .
we got any ideas ?
unfortunately , no .
the people who are looking after little sara
say that vanessa was good people .
she had strong ties to the community ,
and she was active in her little girl &apos;s school .
what &apos;s her occupation ?
well , she told her neighbors she was into finance .
said her expertise was in emerging latin american markets
or some such thing .
she hadn &apos;t managed to find a job on the island anywhere yet ,
but she said she was interviewing .
i also spoke with the mexican government
i figured maybe there was something she was into over there
that followed her over here ,
but they said they didn &apos;t know anything about that .
but ... here &apos;s what they do have on her .
vanessa was born in la tuna ,
which is a small town in sinaloa .
both her parents were farmers . they &apos;re deceased now .
but she may have had a cousin .
the mexican government &apos;s looking into that .
chin , what do you got ?
one of the realtors we spoke to recognized our thief .
she says the guy &apos;s name is doug morrow .
they met at an open house recently .
now , apparently , morrow told her he that was from the mainland ,
but he never said from where .
the realtor also said
that morrow was interested in a pocket listing
she has coming up .
he left a cell phone number to contact him at
when the place was ready to be shown .
i &apos;m texting you the number right now .
卫星定位锁定
got him . windward side of the island .
all right , me and danny will go pick him up .
thanks , chin .
forget it , benny .
she &apos;s married . i already asked .
老大说你能解除戒备了
excuse me .
yes ?
excuse me , hirsch ?
yes , uh , what is it ?
good news . we got the guy .
oh , that-- superb , great .
so i &apos;m gonna be ...
yeah .
you should get going now .
gerard , who is it ?
uh , no one .
just a friend . she &apos;s leaving .
well , tell her to come in .
uh , she &apos;s @-@ she &apos;s in a rush , pop .
a rush ? everyone &apos;s always in a rush .
i want to meet her .
uh , may @-@ maybe another time !
another time ? i could be dead tomorrow .
dad !
look , it &apos;s fine .
hi .
i &apos;m kono .
my , aren &apos;t you gorgeous .
uh , how do you do ?
leo hirsch .
it &apos;s good to meet you , mr. hirsch .
you &apos;re with them .
uh , you &apos;re five @-@ 0 .
gerard &apos;s told me all about you .
sounds like my boy &apos;s been helping the team .
well , yes , he has .
actually , because of him ,
we have a good shot of clearing the case we &apos;re working .
just like the other times , right ?
we @-@ we don &apos;t need to talk about that .
gerard &apos;s told me about what he did for you .
taking time off from the gallery
to help you catch a couple of people ?
even volunteering to put himself in danger a couple of times .
i &apos;m so proud of him .
he &apos;s a good boy .
yes . he &apos;s , uh , he &apos;s special .
i wish there was more like him in the world .
well , um ,
officer kalakaua really has to get going .
and @-@ and come to think of it , she &apos;s my ride , so ,
i have to go , too .
i &apos;m gonna come see you in a few days , dad .
i put it down in your calendar .
and i &apos;ll bring some new paint and brushes with me .
oh , and promise
you won &apos;t give your nurses any trouble about taking your meds .
i &apos;ll try not to .
bye . good meeting you .
so , i take it he doesn &apos;t know about ...
about my former life as a criminal ?
no .
thanks for playing along .
i appreciate your discretion .
i was in the master bedroom
when i heard the front door unlock .
so i go check the cameras .
the guy sat her down .
started going through her phone .
then he started questioning her .
about what , i have no idea ,
since there was no audio .
i don &apos;t think she was giving him any answers ,
&apos;cause the guy was getting pissed .
he had to hit her a few more times
before she started talking .
okay , what happened next ?
the guy made the mistake of turning his back on her .
after she got free ,
she ran for the bedroom .
and when i realized where she was going , i ...
i locked myself inside the safe room .
she hit the panic button ,
grabbed a gun out of the dresser .
she wasn &apos;t fast enough .
guy came in and shot her before she could pull the trigger .
after that , he picked up the gun and took off .
i waited till he was gone , then i came out .
i tried to help her , but it was too late .
then i heard the cops coming .
i was afraid if they found me , they &apos;d think i did it .
you got to believe me .
there &apos;s nothing more i could &apos;ve done .
so , morrow took these pictures off the monitors
in the safe room ?
yeah , he wanted evidence to back up his story .
the resolution &apos;s obviously not very good .
well , good enough , though .
here &apos;s our murderer :
jimmy brigante , 36 years old .
convictions for assault and weapons possession .
yeah , but nothing here seems to connect him with our vic .
wait , wait , wait . look at that .
known associates .
this guy &apos;s suspected of being
one of michelle shioma &apos;s top soldiers .
so how does a single mother living in kahala
get herself mixed up with a yakuza boss ?
maybe vanessa diaz was more
than a single mother from kahala .
‭ let &apos;s think about it .
she &apos;s got no job . she &apos;s got no spouse .
she &apos;s got no money coming in ,
yet she lives in a 5,000 @-@ square @-@ foot house
in one of the island &apos;s most expensive zip codes .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a regular citizen to me , all right ?
and @-@ and let &apos;s not forget
the town she &apos;s from , it &apos;s in sinaloa .
right , the narco capital of the world .
so what , you think she &apos;s part of a drug cartel ?
well , i don &apos;t know , but i mean ,
the background in finance , i @-@ it could be a cover .
something to explain why she has money .
well , if you &apos;re right , then vanessa &apos;s murder
just might be another one of shioma &apos;s power moves ,
like she did with adam .
all right , let &apos;s contact the dea .
see if they got anything on vanessa .
and let &apos;s get an alert out on brigante .
um , thanks again ...
for before .
your dad seems really sweet .
seems like you have a good relationship .
that wasn &apos;t always the case .
when @-@ when i was growing up ,
i was closer to my mom .
after she died ,
uh , my dad and i drifted apart .
it &apos;s really just been the past few years
that we &apos;ve patched things up .
well , he &apos;s lucky to have you looking after him .
tell you the truth ,
it @-@ it hasn &apos;t been easy .
his , uh , health is failing .
not sure how much time he has left .
it &apos;s been , uh ...
difficult to watch .
i know what you mean , actually ,
&apos;cause my mom suffered a brain aneurysm a few years ago .
and she can &apos;t speak .
she needs constant care .
it &apos;s been rough on everyone .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , i should let you get back to actual police work .
you know , you &apos;re a good egg , officer kalakaua .
that adam is a lucky man .
mcgarrett asked me to see
if i could verify vanessa &apos;s finance background ,
so i checked with all the brokerage houses on the island ,
and none of them have ever interviewed a vanessa diaz
who specializes in emerging markets in latin america .
well , steve was right .
job was a cover story .
good work .
jer , i was thinking ...
you have a stable job here now , right ?
yeah , i mean , still no badge , but ...
but , uh , you &apos;re employed , got some money in the bank .
i got a little green .
actually , most of it &apos;s gold now .
started converting it last year .
think we &apos;re going back to the gold standard .
right , right , i remember you telling me .
well , seeing as you have a job and some money ,
i &apos;m wondering if it might be time to ...
get your own place .
you want me to move out ?
is this &apos; cause i don &apos;t pay rent ?
because i pitch in in other ways .
i mean , cooking , cleaning , laundry .
no , no , uh , it &apos;s not about the rent .
is it me ?
am i doing something ?
no ... no , this is ... actually more about me .
i see .
it &apos;s not me , it &apos;s you .
or is this about her ?
well ...
look , i &apos;m not an idiot , okay ?
i can see with abby in the picture
how i might be cramping your style .
i mean , a little ... ?
sure .
you want your alone time . i got that .
but , you know , for the record , any time i hear any noises ,
i slap on some headphones .
you know , unlike the nsa , i respect your privacy .
i appreciate that .
uh , but s @-@ still .
you want me gone .
look , we don &apos;t have to decide anything right now .
i just wanted to start the discussion .
no , no , no , no ... i get it .
lieutenant kelly .
i &apos;m sorry ?
when the officers came to pick her up ,
sara told them that she had an uncle in the police department .
said his name was chin .
okay .
is that all she said ?
yeah .
and no one &apos;s told her about her mom yet , right ?
no . social services wants to give us more time
to ... track down the next of kin .
all right .
let me have a few minutes with her , okay ?
hi , sara .
my name &apos;s lieutenant kelly .
is it okay if we talk for a few minutes ?
okay .
what &apos;s her name ?
newton .
he &apos;s a boy .
of course he &apos;s a boy .
how did i not know that ?
he &apos;s very handsome .
and you have a rabbit bracelet , too .
you must really like rabbits .
my mommy gave it to me .
she said i should never take it off .
that &apos;s a good idea .
you just moved here , right ?
do you know about a place called manana island ?
we also call it rabbit island .
do you know why ?
because there used to be wild rabbits
that used to run all over the place .
and if you look really closely ,
you can see that the island even looks like a rabbit head .
that &apos;s weird .
yes , that &apos;s so weird .
sara , can i ask you a question ?
the nice officer told me
that you said that you had an uncle in the police department .
is that right ?
how do you know that ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s what my mommy told me .
okay .
did your mommy say anything else about this uncle ?
she said he was married to my aunt .
and i was named after her .
okay , so your aunt is named sara , too ?
no , my middle name is my aunt &apos;s name .
what &apos;s your middle name ?
malia .
sara ,
your father ,
is his name gabriel ?
do you know my daddy ?
gabriel must have met vanessa
when he was living in mexico .
he probably kept her and sara a secret
because he knew they &apos;d be targets for his enemies .
yeah , well , shioma must have found out somehow .
that &apos;s why she sent brigante to question vanessa .
she figures if anybody knows where gabriel is , it &apos;s her .
okay , i guess the question is : what did brigante find out ?
what &apos;s gonna happen with sara now ?
well , for the time being , hpd &apos;s gonna take her to a safe house .
i &apos;d like to be there with her .
of course .
all right , we , uh , we should go talk to michelle shioma .
yeah , we should do that now .
thanks for coming back .
yeah , you said , uh , it was urgent .
i got a little concerned .
but you didn &apos;t say anything to gerard , right ?
no .
good . good .
malasada ?
they &apos;re a little stale but still pretty good .
no , thanks .
mr. hirsch , is everything all right ?
no , ev @-@ everything is fine .
i just wanted to talk to you about my son .
just the two of us .
okay .
look , i know the truth .
i know what he &apos;s done .
the stolen paintings , the forgeries , prison .
he tries , but he can &apos;t fool me .
i don &apos;t understand .
if you know about everything , why do you pretend not to ?
because it &apos;s important to gerard
to believe that i &apos;m proud of him .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know where i went wrong with him .
believe me , i didn &apos;t set out to raise a crook .
i &apos;m sure you did your best .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
he seems to have really turned his life around .
yes , that &apos;s true .
but i know it isn &apos;t easy for him .
my son has a real affection
for the finer things ,
and i know he misses that stuff .
look , i know we don &apos;t know each other ,
but i need to ask a favor .
will you keep an eye on him for me ?
help him to stay on the straight and narrow ?
of course .
thank you .
vanessa diaz ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t know anyone by that name .
okay , what about jimmy brigante ?
you know him ?
that sounds familiar .
uh , think he may have been one of my daughter &apos;s tennis coaches .
or , uh , was it swimming ?
all right , vanessa diaz &apos;s full name
is vanessa diaz waincroft .
she was gabriel &apos;s wife ,
she was shot dead in her home last night ,
and jimmy brigante pulled the trigger .
now , you already know all this
because jimmy brigante works for you ,
and you &apos;re the one who sent him over there to get information .
at the moment , brigante &apos;s in the wind ,
but we are gonna catch up with him ,
and when we do , he &apos;s gonna roll on you .
look , here &apos;s the thing . you @-@ you got kids , right ?
you got-- your daughters are , what , eight and ten years old ?
the way things look right now ,
you &apos;re probably gonna go away and not get out
until the young one &apos;s about 30 years old , right ?
but if you help us ,
maybe we can guarantee that you get to see ,
uh , the young one &apos;s high school graduation .
look , all we want to know is what brigante was able to learn
about gabriel &apos;s whereabouts . that &apos;s it .
gentlemen , if i knew where to find gabriel waincroft ,
i would tell you .
the man killed my father .
i want to see him punished as much as you do .
i @-@ i believe that .
but i think that you &apos;d rather see him dead than in prison .
i &apos;m sorry , i just can &apos;t help you .
okay .
well , we &apos;ll just have to see what brigante &apos;s got to say
when we catch up with him .
why is that , uh , why is that funny ?
it &apos;s just that you guys seem pretty confident
despite your track record .
i &apos;m sorry , &quot; track record &quot; ?
oh , meaning five @-@ 0 hasn &apos;t had a whole lot of success
getting people to open up about me .
you talking about the prison guard from halawa ?
that guy was ... he was terrified of you .
but jimmy brigante , he &apos;s a tough kid .
i mean , i guarantee you , he &apos;s gonna give you up in a second
if it means less prison time for him .
her lawyer &apos;s upstairs .
how you doing in there anyway ?
really good , really good .
she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s about to break any second .
got a lead on brigante ?
not a thing .
all right , steve , we got to ... we got to let her go .
we got nothing to hold her on . no ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
yeah , well , you and me both .
do you think malia knew about vanessa ?
it &apos;s possible .
i know she was in touch with gabriel when he was in mexico .
okay , so what &apos;s she like ? sara ?
she &apos;s a sweet kid .
the fact is , she &apos;s gabriel &apos;s blood .
having a hard time wrapping my head around that .
yeah , well , she &apos;s malia &apos;s blood , too .
yeah .
listen , i should go .
okay , i @-@ i &apos;ll talk to you later .
no ! no ! no !
stop !
no !
abby , find sara .
the bracelet .
her bracelet .
what ? what bracelet ? i don &apos;t understand .
bracelet .
sorry , we need to go .
steve !
he &apos;s okay . listen to me .
he &apos;s gonna be all right .
two shots , through and through ,
no vitals , okay ?
he &apos;s gonna be okay , all right ?
all right , maile amber alert is out .
hpd is pulling traffic footage .
all right , what about the dead guy ?
we get an i.d. ?
yeah , his name &apos;s raymond murata .
and , uh , he &apos;s got , uh , ties to the yakuza .
this has shioma written all over it .
okay , what is her endgame anyway ?
i mean , this isn &apos;t a ransom play .
is she really thinking
of killing gabriel &apos;s daughter out of revenge ?
i think that might be over the line , even for her .
if that was the plan , they would &apos;ve done it right here .
it &apos;s got to be about leverage .
it &apos;s leverage .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m sure gabriel didn &apos;t tell vanessa
where he is , okay , but what if ,
what if she knows how to get in touch with him ?
maybe that is what brigante got out of her .
and now that michelle has sara ,
she can reach out to gabriel and offer him a deal .
right .
he hands himself in , she lets the kid go .
look , i don &apos;t give a damn if we got proof or not ,
we need to drag michelle shioma in
and get her to tell us where sara is .
i don &apos;t-- - she &apos;s not gonna say-- tell her what ?
she &apos;s not gonna say anything .
he &apos;s right .
she &apos;s not gonna talk , but if we keep her out there ,
we can monitor her and maybe get a lead .
and what if we don &apos;t , then ?
how are we gonna find sara ?
her bracelet .
what about it ?
chin just said something about sara having a bracelet .
so ?
i worked a kidnapping case years ago--
a young daughter of a wealthy family .
the only way we could find her
was thanks to a gps chip in her necklace .
parents thought she might be a target ,
so they made her wear it all the time .
and maybe vanessa took the same precautions .
maybe sara &apos;s bracelet &apos;s a tracker .
okay , abby , get in touch with every security company
on the island that does gps monitoring of children .
let &apos;s do that right now .
okay .
no ! no !
no ... !
chin was right about the bracelet .
vanessa used a company called hawkeye security
to track sara &apos;s movements .
they just sent us the gps coordinates .
she &apos;s being held in a house in waimanalo .
all right , so i got four infrared bodies .
looks to be three hostiles
and little sara .
so , she &apos;s just sitting right out there in the open .
we rush in there , she can get hit in the crossfire .
chin .
steve , don &apos;t ask me to stand down .
the little girl &apos;s my niece .
i &apos;m gonna check the perimeter .
target in sight .
go .
steve , we got another one !
infrared didn &apos;t pick him up .
he must have been downstairs .
that &apos;s close enough !
brigante .
please stop ! please let me go !
she &apos;s just a little kid . you let her go .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
let her go .
three seconds !
one .
put the kid down !
two .

sara , it &apos;s lieutenant kelly .
i got you , okay ?
i got you .
is she all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna take her out .
all right , here we go .
you okay ?
sara , i &apos;m taking the blindfold off , okay ?
okay ? hey , you okay ?
all right , come here .
it &apos;s okay , everything &apos;s gonna be fine now , okay ?

she &apos;s gonna help us , too , okay ?
you &apos;re safe , okay ?
we got you .
let us take these off .
brigante .
oh , damn .
this guy was our best shot at nailing shioma .
yep .
but saving that kid out there ?
that &apos;s all that mattered .
i still don &apos;t know why i agreed to this .
because surfing is awesome .
and you &apos;re gonna get a free , one @-@ on @-@ one lesson
from a former pro .
yes , but i hate the water .
and other than getting to see me
in a bathing suit ,
i don &apos;t know what you get out of it .
it &apos;s my way of saying thanks .
you &apos;ve been a big asset to five @-@ 0 .
you &apos;ve helped us close four cases in the past year .
and i want you to know that we appreciate it .
and you .
i &apos;m moved , officer kalakaua .
of course , i could think of some other ways
you could show your appreciation .
really ?
uh , that @-@ that wasn &apos;t a sleazy come @-@ on !
it &apos;s just that i abhor the sea !
there &apos;s sharks and jellyfish and stingrays and coral reefs .
if god had meant for man to swim ,
he would &apos;ve given us flippers .
hirsch ?
i got your back .
i &apos;m not gonna let anything happen to you .
let &apos;s go .
okay , first thing , this is your surfboard .
where &apos;s the seat ?
funny . when you get into the water ,
you &apos;re gonna want to lay down on it like this and paddle .
will you give me mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth if i drown ?
seriously ?
okay , i &apos;ll shut up now .
mommy ?
you slept a long time .
