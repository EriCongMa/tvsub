cort , this is ... this is callie , my ... my sister .
she &apos;s the girl you loved
and couldn &apos;t be with for some reason .
do you ever think that maybe the only reason why we got together
was because we were the only two gay boys in our grade ?
we were friends first .
you don &apos;t feel like my friend anymore .
why don &apos;t you date ana ?
you guys would be so cute together .
wait , you &apos;re bleeding . let me see .
if i let them take me out of this home ,
they &apos;re just gonna put me in another one .
if you &apos;re ever not feeling this ,
then just be honest with me .
i finally believed you guys were desperately in love .
well , guys , we made it .
opening night .
mat and i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
well , that &apos;s true .
and now we get to , uh , just coast for the rest of the year
&apos;cause our senior project is done .
screw you . i still got a dumb @-@ ass paper to write .
although , i ... i guess it only , uh , matters
if you go to anchor beach .
you know , i wish i would have thought of this when i was a senior .
all right , well , thank you all for being here
and making this possible .
yeah , you owe me big time .
uh , yeah he does !
so , just remember to , uh ,
talk loud , tell the truth ,
and &quot; unbreakable &quot; on three .
let &apos;s go . one , two , three .
unbreakable !
all right , guys . i &apos;ll see you out there .
hey , mariana !
flowers for my , uh , beautiful flower .
aww ! thanks .
anytime . come here .
give me that .
we should open them at the same time .
okay .
hey . i ... i didn &apos;t think you were gonna come .
i wasn &apos;t gonna miss your show , brandon .
uh , here .
animal crackers .
it &apos;s dumb , i know .
i bought them before ...
you know .
hey , um , i &apos;m gonna open the house if that &apos;s ...
okay . yeah . sure .
你在哪儿 就要开始了
neighbors reporting what sounded like domestic violence .
sorry , you &apos;re gonna miss the show .
yeah , me too .
hey , foster .
hi .
i know this place .
i &apos;ve been here before . my kids ...
this is their last foster home .
? two households , both alike in dignity ?
? in fair verona , where we lay our scene ?
? from ancient grudge break to new mutiny ?
? where civil blood makes civil hands unclean ?
it &apos;s kind of ironic that i &apos;m playing the nurse
when i &apos;m really mat &apos;s juliet
and you &apos;re more like his rosaline .
? from forth the fatal loins of these two foes ?
? a pair of star @-@ cross &apos;d lovers take their life ?
? whose misadventured piteous overthrows ?
? do with their death ?
? bury their parents &apos; strife ?
? the fearful passage of their death @-@ mark &apos;d love ?
? and the continuance of their parents &apos; rage ?
? which , but their children &apos;s end ?
? nought could remove ?
? is now the two hours &apos; traffic of our stage ?
? the which if you ?
? with patient ears attend ?
? what here shall miss ?
? our toil shall strive to mend ?
if i &apos;m being honest , this play is kind of dumb .
what do you mean ?
if romero and juliet just told somebody
they were in love and already got married ,
maybe they could have worked it out
and it wouldn &apos;t be so tragic .
i mean , sure , it would have been
hard on the families and everyone ,
but they would have had to figure it out , right ?
secrets are , like , the worst .
they didn &apos;t have to die .
? along this road of shadows ?
? you got to bend a few rules ?
? to put down the overthrows ?
? if you want to keep control ?
? that &apos;s just the way it goes ?
? you got to keep your eyes wide open ?
? if you want to make it out on top ?
? like you &apos;re hoping ?
? they can try to hold the line ?
? it &apos;s a just a waste of time ?
? nothing you could do ?
? could ever stop us ?
? we &apos;re unstoppable , unstoppable ?
? nothing you could say could ever break us ?
? we &apos;re unbreakable , unbreakable ?
? oh , we &apos;re unbreakable ?
? if you want to keep control ?
? that &apos;s just the way it goes ?
? nothing you could do could ever stop us ?
? we &apos;re unstoppable , unstoppable ?
? nothing you could say could ever break us ?
? we &apos;re unbreakable , unbreakable ?
? we &apos;re unbreakable ?
i &apos;m sorry about connor .
never been in love before ...
um , but , uh ...
i ... i know what it &apos;s like to feel alone .
sorry they shut your group home down .
but you know it wasn &apos;t safe .
i know .
but they &apos;re gonna find you a good home .
and until then ...
i &apos;m happy you &apos;re here .
me too .
thanks .
good night .
? what &apos;s an island without an ocean ?
? what &apos;s a star without a sky ?
? there &apos;s a picture of us in my memory ?
? but we &apos;re fading to the back of my mind ?
? all i really know is ?
? i need you back here ?
tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
out of love .
&quot; out of love &quot; ?
out of her favor , where i am in love .
be ruled by me .
forget to think of her .
o , teach me how i should forget to think !
by giving liberty unto thine eyes .
examine other beauties .
i dreamed a dream last night .
i &apos;m a mom , brandon .
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s the way it is
and if you can &apos;t handle that , then ...
i ... i never said i couldn &apos;t handle it .
well , you might as well have the way you ...
responded to that woman on the beach yesterday .
&quot; i &apos;m not his father . &quot; you just ... you blurted it out
like she was ...
accusing you of something !
okay . i &apos;m sorry .
this is ... kind of new to me .
brandon , all i &apos;m asking is
that you be honest about what you can handle .
you gotta decide if you &apos;re ready for this ,
and not just because of mason .
you gotta decide if you &apos;re really ready to get over callie .
here &apos;s the thing .
if you &apos;re not done with callie ,
like , really , truly done ...
then i have to be done with this .
they are capulet .
so they are .
but they &apos;re my mother &apos;s sworn enemy .
shall we ?
go .
please .
come on .
happily met , my lady and my wife .
that may be , sir , when i may be a wife .
that &quot; may be &quot; must be , love , on thursday next .
what must be , shall be .
what lady &apos;s that ?
i know not , my friend .
go to her !
? love , we were made for love ?
? living while we &apos;re young ?
? nothing &apos;s gonna stop us ?
? nothing &apos;s gonna stop us ?
? something about you ?
? i got to figure out ?
? &apos; cause i &apos;m believing dreams can come true ?
? turning everything upside down ?
? nothing &apos;s gonna stop us ?
? nothing &apos;s gonna stop us ?
? nothing &apos;s gonna stop us ?
? nothing &apos;s gonna stop us ?
a montague ? !
now , by the stock and honor of my kin ,
to strike him dead i hold it not a sin !
so we think the wife &apos;s still inside ,
but we haven &apos;t heard anything from her yet
and he won &apos;t let us in without a warrant .
based on what dispatch said , we have cause for entry .
no . listen , i know this guy , okay ?
i arrested him last year and he had a gun .
so we wait for the negotiator .
do you really want to do that ? what if the wife is hurt ?
if i remember correctly ,
there &apos;s a clear view through the back door .
okay . all right . take your team around back .
see what you can find .
but soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ?
romeo . o , romeo ! wherefore art thou romeo ?
deny thy father and refuse thy name .
or , if thou wilt not ...
be but sworn my love ,
and i will no longer be a capulet .
? you speak near and true ?
? though not a word i hear from you ?
? for your eyes say it all ?
? and i admit i &apos;m about to fall ?
? because what we have ?
? there is no controlling this ?
? this love could be great ?
? but they say it would be wrong ?
? i don &apos;t care ?
? i &apos;d be lost without you ?
what are you doing up so late ?
uh , just ...
trying to get this song right .
sounds pretty good to me .
eh , i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know if the harmonies are ...
right , but ... do you actually ...
do you think you could wake up mariana ?
maybe get her to sing with me ?
wait , you really want me to unleash the beast ?
and you know what she &apos;s like when you try to wake her up .
be afraid . be very , very afraid .
well , do you ... do you think you could maybe sing with me ?
uh , no . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m ...
come on .
please ?
okay . uh , juliet &apos;s part goes like ...
no , i know it . i &apos;ve heard mariana sing it , like , a billion times .
okay .
? this love could be great ?
? but they say it would be wrong ?
? i don &apos;t care ?
? i &apos;d be lost without you ?
? we live because we love ?
? we love &apos; cause we belong ?
? yes , i swear ?
? oh , you heal the scars ?
? that never felt a wound ?
? and we &apos;ll never need their rules ?
? to guide the way ?
? love will light the day ?
? what &apos;s in a name ?
? i &apos;m ready to risk the blame ?
? call me your own ?
? no matter where we &apos;ve got to go ?
? &apos; cause what we have ?
? there is no controlling this ?
? this love could be great ?
? but they say it would be wrong ?
? i don &apos;t care ?
? &apos; cause i &apos;d be lost without you ?
? we live because we love ?
? we love &apos; cause we belong ?
? yes , i swear ?
? oh , you heal the scars ?
? that never felt a wound ?
? and we &apos;ll never need their rules ?
? to guide the way ?
? love will light the day ?
? love will light the day ?
? love will light the day ?
? love will light the day ?
okay .
it &apos;s funny . um ...
i was talking to mariana earlier
and she was saying how ...
if romeo and juliet ...
had just told their parents ...
then maybe their ending wouldn &apos;t have been so tragic .
do you ever think what ...
might have happened if we just told ?
juliet !
honey nurse !
my love is an honest gentleman .
come with us .
where ?
to friar laurence &apos;s cell .
i , a husband to make your young maiden , mine wife .
a husband ?
romeo ?
midnight angel , can you love the gentleman ?
aye .
juliet !
his name is romeo .
and a montague .
the only son of your great enemy .
god &apos;s lady dear !
is this the poultice for my aching bones ?
honey nurse , i beg of thee .
? happily ever after ?
? no , it doesn &apos;t exist ?
? it &apos;s just a lie to ?
? get you to take the risk ?
? gotta guard your heart ?
? oh , i know you feel he &apos;s a perfect fit ?
? but nothing about this makes sense ?
that &apos;s it ! come on !
just let it go ! just to hell with connor !
now let &apos;s scream !
no , no ! like ...
like , scream ! like ...
? even if this is love ?
? it &apos;s never gonna do ?
let &apos;s away .
? when i look in your eyes ?
? i see the one that i want for all time ?
? just place your hand in mine ?
? together i know we can conquer the darkest night ?
? i will be yours ?
? forever , forever ?
? i will be yours ?
? forever ?
? every song i sing , it &apos;s you ?
? every laugh i laugh , it &apos;s you ?
? when i look in your eyes ?
? i see the one that i want for all time ?
? when i look in your eyes ?
? i see the one that i want for all time ?
? just place your hand in mine ?
? together i know we can conquer the darkest night ?
? i will be yours ?
? forever , forever ?
? i will be yours ?
? forever ?
? every song i sing , it &apos;s you ?
? every laugh i laugh , it &apos;s you ?
? every hope i have is you ?
? i will be yours ?
? forever , forever ?
? i will be yours ?
? forever , forever ?
? i will be yours ?
? i will be yours ?
? forever , forever ?
? i will be yours ?
? i &apos;ll be yours ?
? forever ?
? just say , &quot; i do &quot; ?
? i do ?
hey , you ... you okay ?
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
y ... you &apos;re doing great out there .
yeah , i ... i know . it &apos;s just ...
this is really hard .
why ?
i know i shouldn &apos;t say this , but ...
because i still love you .
then why didn &apos;t you answer my letter ?
what ... what letter ?
vogue , well ...
it &apos;s perfect .
i wrote you a letter and i put it in your bag .
well , i ... i never got it .
what did it say ?
that i still love you too .
baby , baby ! you are killin &apos; it !
come here , come here .
eyes on suspect .
he is armed , looks to be a .45,
and no sign of the wife .
copy . she &apos;s not there .
how do you you that ?
she just pulled up out front .
she hasn &apos;t been there all day .
well , then who &apos;s inside ?
gentlemen , good e &apos;en .
a word with one of you .
and but one word with one of us ?
couple it with something .
make it a word and a blow .
romeo .
the love i bear thee can afford , no better term than this :
thou art a villain .
it &apos;s going great , right ?
you know , maybe we should just rewrite the show .
what if juliet just chooses paris instead ?
yeah , i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t think
brandon would like that very much ...
or shakespeare .
well , i guess it &apos;s good they died then .
i mean , romeo and juliet were never gonna make it as a couple .
i don &apos;t even think they ever consummated their relationship .
everybody knows sex is where the real bonding happens .
like with me and mat .
when we had sex , it really took things to the next level
and it really brought us so much closer .
you know , and i knew that i could trust him .
he &apos;s just not the kind of guy who would just
have sex with a girl and then dump her .
anyway , see you out there .
? along this road of shadows ?
? you got to bend a few rules ?
? to put down the overthrows ?
wait , don &apos;t !
? if you want to keep control ?
? that &apos;s just the way it goes ?
? nothing you could do could ever stop us ?
? we &apos;re unstoppable , unstoppable ?
? nothing you could say could ever break us ?
? we &apos;re unbreakable , unbreakable ?
? oh , we &apos;re unbreakable ?
can you id any children inside ?
drop the gun !
? you got to keep your eyes wide open ?
? if you want to make it out on top like you &apos;re hoping ?
no ! stop !
? they can try to hold the line ?
? it &apos;s just a waste of time ?
? nothing you could do could ever stop us ?
? we &apos;re unstoppable , unstoppable ?
? nothing you could say could ever break us ?
? we &apos;re unbreakable , unbreakable ?
? oh , we &apos;re unbreakable ?
mercutio , stop !
no !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
okay . hold you fire !
suspect is down ! suspect is down !
requesting medical stat !
tybalt !
mercutio &apos;s soul is but a little way above our heads .
either thou or i or both of us go with him !
thou , wretched boy , shall with him hence !
romeo , away !
be gone from verona !
paris will doom thee to death .
nay !
be gone ! away !
uh , i ... i think , uh ...
i think i did something stupid .
what ?
i kissed jude .
well , why is that stupid ?
i mean , do you like him ?
y ... yeah , i ... i do ,
but as a friend .
i ... i ... i &apos;m not gay .
so why did you kiss him ?
he was just so ... so upset about connor ,
and i ... i wanted to make him feel better .
well , then you have to tell him the truth .
tybalt is gone
and romeo banished .
romeo that killed him , he is banished .
paris shall not make me a joyful bride .
hold then .
go home , be merry ,
consent to marry paris .
take thou this vial , being then in bed ,
and this distilling liquor drink thou off .
when presently through all thy veins shall run no pulse
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
and in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death ,
thou shall continue two and forty hours ,
and then awake as from pleasant sleep .
in the meantime , against thou shalt awake ,
shall romeo by my letters know our drift
and hither shall he come to save you .
love , give me strength ...
and strength shall help afford .
farewell , dear friar .
me thought we had more time ?
the time has arrive &apos;d .
? i know it was just a moment ago ?
? when we stepped out on this road ?
? but now i can &apos;t imagine love ?
? without you here ?
? so hold my heart though you &apos;re far away ?
? it &apos;s not the end but one more day ?
? until we make it through ?
? know that i love you ?
? i will be brave ?
? i will be strong ?
? nothing can tear us apart ?
? just one more step ?
? just one more breath ?
? for you , i will ?
? i will be brave ?
i ... guess that &apos;s everything .
hey , everything &apos;s ... everything is gonna be okay .
maybe this will , you know , be your last foster home .
maybe this will be your forever home .
so listen , um ...
i shouldn &apos;t have kissed you .
no , i ... i &apos;m glad you did .
i &apos;m not ...
really over connor , but ...
i realized i ... i can get over him .
and , you know , maybe there &apos;s someone else out there .
oh , you forgot something .
it &apos;s a pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ go phone .
i had my moms get it
and charge it with a ton of minutes .
jude , i can &apos;t take ...
and whenever you run out ,
i will use my allowance to buy you more time .
so we can talk , whenever you want .
thanks .
? we live because we love ?
? we love &apos; cause we belong ?
? yes , i swear ?
? oh , you heal the scars that never felt a wound ?
? and we &apos;ll never need their rules ?
? to guide the way ?
? love will light the day ?
juliet !
what ?
i mean , what would have happened if we told ?
you want to tell moms ?
come on . let &apos;s go .
what ?
brandon , come on .
brandon , stop .
what ?
we ... we can &apos;t .
we can &apos;t what ?
tell moms .
why not ?
because you know why .
no , i don &apos;t . tell me . why can &apos;t we ?
it &apos;s too late .
i know .
within three hours
will fair juliet wake .
she will beshrew me much that romeo hath had
no notice of these accidents .
so , to romeo , a letter of dear import .
now , be gone !
the gallant paris shall ne &apos;er make juliet a joyful bride .
juliet !
juliet !
we got a body in the kitchen !
what did you do ? what did you do ?
eyes , look your last ...
arms , take your last embrace ...
and lips ...
seal with a righteous kiss ,
a dateless bargain to engrossing death .
romeo .
romeo !
? just close your eyes , love ?
? and dream of a place ?
? where no hearts were ever broken ?
? no moments to erase ?
? in my mind , i see it now ?
? that smile upon your face ?
? we are nothing without each other ?
? when it &apos;s said and done ?
? we are oceans crashing together ?
? but the storm is on the run ?
? we are madness , we are beauty ?
? we &apos;re our own redemption ?
? can &apos;t let these walls come between us ?
? our hearts will bleed as one ?
? we are nothing without each other ?
? when it &apos;s said and done ?
? we are oceans crashing together ?
? but the storm is on the run ?
? we are madness , we are beauty ?
? we &apos;re our own redemption ?
? can &apos;t let these walls come between us ?
? our hearts will bleed as one ?
? we are nothing without each other ?
? we live because we love ?
? we love &apos; cause we belong ?
? we are oceans crashing together ?
? but the storm is on the run ?
? we are madness , we are beauty ?
? we &apos;re our own redemption ?
? can &apos;t let these walls come between us ?
? this love could be great ?
? but they say it would be wrong ?
? i don &apos;t care ?
? i &apos;d be lost without you ?
? we live because we love ?
? we love &apos; cause we belong ?
? i swear ?
? oh , you heal the scars that never felt a wound ?
? and we &apos;ll never need their rules ?
? to guide the way ?
? love will light the day ?
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful juliet .
as rich as romeo &apos;s by his lady &apos;s lie ,
poor sacrifices of our enmity .
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo .
why ? why ...
