hey , emma , you better appreciate this while it lasts ..
because when you get older , you &apos;re not gonna be able to just sit around all day .
so true .
yeah .
hey .
hey .
we &apos;re here to say goodbye . we &apos;re off to ohio .
oh , right , your adoption interview .
yep . we &apos;ll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby .
i can &apos;t believe it . when you come back , you &apos;ll have a baby . that is so weird .
and so incorrect .
she &apos;s only a couple months pregnant .
she liked our application but might not like us .
come on , she &apos;s gonna love you guys .
thank you . but we &apos;re trying not to get our hopes up .
a lot could still get in our way .
she could decide against adoption , like another couple better .
what are you gonna name it ?
i could develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word .
but just think , okay ? what if everything goes right ?
what if this woman does pick you guys ?
oh , my god . she &apos;s gonna pick us !
so we &apos;re standing firm on &quot; not getting our hopes up &quot; ?
no . i know things could still go wrong , but if they don &apos;t ..
if this works out , we &apos;re gonna have a baby . a baby !
yes . but ..
oh , my god . it &apos;s gonna work !
we &apos;re gonna make it work !
i &apos;m gonna be a mommy , and you &apos;re gonna be a daddy !
all right , i &apos;ll see you suckers . i &apos;m gonna go get me a baby !
screw it . i &apos;m gonna be a daddy !
the.one.with.the.birth.mother

but i have grown up a lot . really . honest . rach ?
yeah , believe it or not , it &apos;s true .
i mean , when joey and i were together ..
he was wonderful . he was thoughtful and mature .
and for the one week that we went out ..
he didn &apos;t sleep with anybody else .

ross , please trust me . i buy 30 fashion magazines a month .

but i do know that you have to get far away from that hat .
damn it . god ..
i have this date tomorrow night , and i have to look cool .
well , who &apos;s the girl ?
her name &apos;s joan .
she &apos;s in fashion . she works for hugo boss .
hugo boss ? i thought you said she was in fashion .
at the ralph lauren offices , that would &apos;ve killed .
if you want fashion help , rachel and l are going shopping tomorrow .
you &apos;re welcome to come with us .
really ? that would be great .
i mean , i have to do something .
she kind of teased me about how i dress .
i can see why . nice shirt .
you &apos;re wearing the same shirt .
stupid gap on every corner !
make yourselves comfortable , and i &apos;ll be back with erica .
okay , thank you .
well , this is it .
are you okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s just weird , you know ?
it &apos;s like , &quot; hi , i &apos;m chandler . may i have the human growing inside you ? &quot;
you &apos;re gonna be great .
you &apos;re gonna be great .
well , obviously .
monica ? chandler ? i &apos;d like you to meet erica .
hi .
hi . it is so , so nice to meet you .
hi .
thank you for agreeing to see us .
hi .
i &apos;ll let you get acquainted .
okay .
so it &apos;s monica and chandler ?
i only know you as &quot; file crw33815 @-@ d. &quot;
that &apos;s what our friends call us .
gosh , you know , you &apos;re just such an amazing couple . it &apos;s ..
kind of intimidating .
i don &apos;t know about that .
are you kidding me ? i mean , it &apos;s enough that you &apos;re a doctor .
but on top of it , you &apos;re married to a reverend ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s exactly ..
let her finish , doctor .
hey .
hey .
my friend sarah had a great time last night .
yeah .
yeah , so you gonna call this one back ?
no .
what are you talking about ? sarah &apos;s great .
oh , really ? you want to know what your &quot; great &quot; friend did ?
we &apos;re out to dinner , okay ?
we were getting along , having a really nice time .
i was thinking she was really cool .
and then , out of nowhere ..
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s why you won &apos;t go out with her again ?
so she took some fries . big deal .
hey , look , it &apos;s not about a few fries .
it &apos;s about what the fries represent .
what ?
all food !
well , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t believe i set you up with such a monster !
hey , look , i take a girl out ..
she can order whatever she wants . the more the better , all right ?
just don &apos;t order a garden salad and then eat my food !
that &apos;s a good way to lose some fingers .
thank god you &apos;re here . listen to this .
what ?
joey and my friend are out last night , having dinner , and she reaches over ..
and takes a few of his fries ..
oh , no !
what ?
you know about the plate thing ?
oh , yeah , yeah . no , joey doesn &apos;t share food .
i mean , just last week we were having breakfast ..
and he had a couple grapes on his plate .
you wouldn &apos;t let her have a grape ?
no , not me .
emma .
joey doesn &apos;t share food !
well , i still think that is a stupid reason not to call someone again .
you are calling her , okay ?
and if you need to , then just get an extra plate of fries for the table .
i like that .
a sharing buffer . yeah .
yeah , i &apos;ll order some extra fries . maybe a plate of onion rings .
yeah . yeah .
and a shrimp cocktail .
and some buffalo wings .
maybe .. maybe an individual pizza , huh ?
and some mozzarella sticks .
what were we talking about ?
wow , this place is awesome . everyone is so mean .
so fun .
we should just go . i &apos;m not gonna find anything here .
this stuff is ridiculous .
oh , this place is great !
okay , you guys have fun . i &apos;m gonna go talk to people in this voice .
rach , come on , i &apos;m not gonna wear any of this . nothing silver .
why ?
okay , nothing with hair .
and nothing with padlocks on it !
ross , look . look , i know that some of this stuff is out there .
but i mean , come on , look at this . look at this sweater .
i mean , this is just beautiful .
wow , this is really soft .
three hundred and fifty dollars ?
down from 700 . you &apos;re saving , like , 200 bucks .
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today .
hey , check this out . it &apos;s totally you .
wow .
yeah .
wow . actually , this looks pretty good .
yeah .
&quot; boys will be boys &quot; ?
what ? they will be !
all right .
that &apos;s it , i &apos;m getting out of here .
no , ross , wait , come on .
there &apos;s other stuff here . there &apos;s some nice shirts , these nice pants .
actually , these might look pretty good on me .
yes , they will . you know what you should do ? go take a walk .
all right ? i know your size , and i &apos;ll pick out some really good stuff for you .
really ?
yes .
i know what looks sexy on guys .
just wear what i suggest , and she is gonna go nuts for you .
so you &apos;re saying ..
if i wear these pants , i might be getting into hers ?
why do men keep talking to me like this ?
so the fact that i &apos;m a doctor and my wife &apos;s a reverend ..
that &apos;s important to you ?
yeah . i read some great applications ..
but i thought , &quot; who better than a minister to raise a child ? &quot;
amen .
plus , i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor .
good hands .
healing hands .
reverend , can i ask ? does the bible say anything about adoption ?
it says , &quot; do it . &quot;
&quot; and behold , she did adopt unto them a baby .
and it was good . &quot;
wow .
yeah , wow .
i was wondering .. you both have such serious jobs .
would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock ?
my flock ?
people in your church .
oh , my flock .
oh , no , my flock ? my flock is good .
yeah . my flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point .
good flock . flock , flock , flock .
but being a doctor , that must take up a lot of time .
not for me it doesn &apos;t .
so how &apos;s everything going in here ?
we &apos;re great . i think i may have asked all my questions .
good . do you have questions for erica ?
yeah , actually . so you read a file that you liked ..
and then you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us ?
yes . our system ensures total anonymity .
we &apos;re very proud of it .
you should be .
you &apos;re really on top of stuff .
well then , if there &apos;s nothing else , then the two of us should talk .
i actually ..
i don &apos;t think we have to .
we don &apos;t ?
yeah , when i read about you two , i was pretty sure i wanted you ..
but i just thought we should meet face to face .
i &apos;ve made my decision .
i choose them .
oh , my god , this is great .
this is so great . did you hear that ?
yeah , i did .
hey .
thank you . thank you so much .
you are so going to heaven !
we got some really great stuff .
yeah .
yeah , but i &apos;m not sure about some of the bras i got .
really ? do you want to try some of them on for me ?
okay .
wait , are we in joey &apos;s imagination ?
oh , no . i took one of ross &apos; bags by mistake .
and one of mine is missing .
ross probably has it . you &apos;ll get it from him later .
so , what do you think ?
i think we &apos;re not wearing the same shirt anymore .
yeah . yeah , rachel picked it out for me .
she told me to trust her , and you know what ? i &apos;m glad i did .
i turned quite a few heads on my way over here .
dude , i really don &apos;t think you should be wearing that .
i see .
somebody &apos;s afraid of a little competition with the ladies ?
looks like someone is the ladies !
you &apos;re just jealous because you couldn &apos;t pull this off .
yeah . now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have a date .
see ? all eyes on me !
we are not signing those papers .
why not ?
it &apos;s wrong . they made a mistake . they think we &apos;re somebody else .
god works in mysterious ways .
you have got to stop .
but she liked us .
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica .
if you think about it , i &apos;m kind of like a reverend .
i mean , as a chef , i serve god by feeding the hungry and poor .
your veal chop is 34.95 !
come on , i just .. i think we &apos;ve been given an opportunity .
the mistake &apos;s already made . they &apos;re writing up the papers now .
but we &apos;re not the ones she chose .
how can you feel okay about this ?
because .
we may not be who she thinks we are ..
but no one will ever love that baby more than us .
i know .
i mean , who knows ..
how long it &apos;s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ?
what if no one ever picks us ?
oh , honey ..
please ?
please . we are so close .
monica , i want a baby too .
but this woman is giving away her child .
she deserves to know who it &apos;s going to .
okay . you &apos;re right .
so we &apos;ll tell the truth .
and who knows , you know ? maybe she &apos;ll like us for us .
maybe she will .
why couldn &apos;t i have been a reverend ?
you &apos;re jewish .
technicality !
garden salad for the lady .
oh , that looks great . good ordering .
seafood platter for the gentleman , and extra fries .
enjoy .
those fries look delicious .
i didn &apos;t know you liked french fries .
help yourself . what &apos;s mine is yours .
wow , are those stuffed clams ?
yes , they are my stuffed clams .
how about those fries , though , huh ?
they are delicious .
yeah .
you are beautiful , you know that ?
that is so sweet .
okay , then .
now look what you did !
what ? what is the matter with you ?
i don &apos;t like it when people take food off of my plate , okay ?
but you said , &quot; what &apos;s mine is yours . &quot;
well , i didn &apos;t mean it !
fine . sorry , i didn &apos;t think it was that big a deal .
no , i &apos;m sorry . i ..
i &apos;m overreacting , okay ? it &apos;s just , when it comes to food , i ..
have certain rules ..
okay ? i mean ..
there are things you do , and , you know , things that you don &apos;t do .
wow , this place looks great .
oh , you are gonna love it . and i &apos;m so glad we &apos;re finally doing this .
me too .
here .
so this was fun .
i really am sorry about , you know , before .
and i want to make sure you know i really do like you .
sure , just not as much as clams .
well , stuffed clams ..
chocolate torte for the lady .
cheesecake for the gentleman .
excuse me , sir . there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake .
yes , that &apos;s a raspberry coulis .
coulis is not a monkey ?
when i read the description i thought it came with a little raspberry monkey .
oh , my god .
i &apos;ll just have what she &apos;s having instead .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , sir . that was our last piece .
i &apos;m so stupid ordering cheesecake , trying to be healthy .
oh , no .
this is work . i should call in . can you excuse me ?
yeah , sure . no problem .
what are you doing ? i thought you don &apos;t share food ?
sure i do .
coulis ?
no . if i can &apos;t have your clams , you can &apos;t have my dessert .
this is a two @-@ way street .
really ?
really .
now this all better be here when i come back .
yeah , of course . i can control myself .
stop staring at me !
just a tiny little ..
i &apos;m not even sorry .
hi .
hey .
so these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption .
there &apos;s a lot to go over , but i &apos;ll explain as we go through .
is that a picture ?
yeah .
it &apos;s a sonogram they took of the baby last week .
i thought you might want to see it .
look , doctor .
look , before we sign anything , we really have to talk .
we &apos;re not who you think we are .
i don &apos;t understand .
the agency must have made a mistake .
my wife is not a reverend , and i &apos;m not a doctor .
what ?
that &apos;s impossible .
i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you &apos;d like .
i have to check your file . excuse me .
so who are you ?
our names really are monica and chandler . we &apos;re from new york .
yeah , but the important thing to know about us ..
is how much we would care for this little baby .
so you lied to me before ?
well , we &quot; bore false witness . &quot;
see ? i could be a reverend .
i can &apos;t believe this .
but we were hoping that since we told you the truth ..
that you still might consider ..
giving you my baby ?
you think i &apos;d give you my child after this ?
you don &apos;t have to decide now . if you look at our file ..
i don &apos;t want to look at your file . this is over .
erica , wait .
i have nothing to say to you .
look , you have every reason to be upset .
we did lie .
but only because we &apos;ve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long .
and we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s gonna be before we get another chance .
why don &apos;t you ask the reverend to pray on it ?
erica , please .
just consider us . ask them to see our file .
our last name &apos;s bing .
my wife &apos;s a chef , and i &apos;m in advertising .
oh , yeah .
i actually liked you guys .
but it doesn &apos;t matter . what you did was wrong .
but you did like us .
and you should .
my wife &apos;s an incredible woman .
she is loving , and devoted and caring .
and don &apos;t tell her i said this , but the woman &apos;s always right .
i love my wife more than anything in this world .
and it ..
it kills me that i can &apos;t give her a baby .
i really want a kid .
and when that day finally comes , i &apos;ll learn how to be a good dad .
but my wife ..
she &apos;s already there .
she &apos;s a mother ..
without a baby .
please ?
you still want that baby ?
god bless you , chandler bing !
turns out this sweater is made for a woman .
so why are you still wearing it ?
because it &apos;s soft .
hey , so how was your date ?
not so good .
well , looks like it &apos;s just the two of us tonight , huh , buddy ?
yeah . and you know what ? we could do a lot worse .
yeah .
yeah .
