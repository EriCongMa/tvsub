was there someone else on that beach ?
no
jack &apos;s been sitting on a hoodie that
directly links him to the murder .
just try to get him out of there for a couple of hours .
what &apos;s that ? on your sweatshirt , is that blood ?
when you said you were gonna use lee as your pawn ,
you weren &apos;t kidding .
checkmate .
if i &apos;m going down ,
i &apos;m taking you down with me .
daniel , your ankle monitor--
police ! hands up . don &apos;t move .
they &apos;re saying someone hanged himself .
and confessed to killing tyler .
we have another david clarke @-@ style situation .
is that conrad ?
the graysons murdered my father .
absolution is the most powerful form of forgiveness ...
a full pardon from suspicion and accountability .
it &apos;s the liberation of a stolen future .
a future my father never lived to see .
absolution ...
is a mercy that people who killed him will never know .
the timing of the confession
and jailhouse suicide of drifter lee moran .
coming just hours before the defense
was to present their case ,
has raised suspicions among those who are carefully watching
what many are calling the new trial of the decade .
judge elizabeth hawthorne spent all morning in chambers
with the prosecution and defense teams .
and now billionaire daniel grayson &apos;s fate
hangs in the balance .
and still , grayson &apos;s innocence remains very much in question
in the court of public opinion .
yeah , i &apos;ll say .
you know , if the graysons are behind all this ,
you &apos;re gonna have to steer clear of charlotte .
like you did with amanda clarke ?
charlotte &apos;s headed down a really bad path ,
and i &apos;m partly to blame .
well , exactly .
now that the graysons know that you lied on the stand ,
there &apos;s no telling what they might do to you .
let me guess .
you &apos;re working on your wedding invite list .
well , assuming your ploy to spring your fiance
actually works ,
but why wouldn &apos;t it ? you &apos;re you .
these are the names of the prisoners
from my father &apos;s cell block .
i &apos;ve identified everyone who was involved in the riots
the day that my father was murdered .
now what ?
cross @-@ reference it with the
grayson christmas card list ?
nolan , you know the man that stabbed my father
was never identified .
conrad could have made payments to their families .
he could have arranged for early pardon for good behavior .
another cover @-@ up ?
conrad said on the phone ,
&quot; i &apos;m sorry to put us in this position again . &quot;
if they killed lee to silence him ,
it &apos;s a very strong possibility
that they did the same to my father .
where are you off to now ?
i &apos;m going to check on charlotte . i &apos;m worried about her .
well , it &apos;s not exactly dominik &apos;s best work .
looks a little half @-@ assed if you ask me .
it &apos;s unfinished .
you know , if i &apos;d known you were such a masochist ,
i &apos;d have volunteered to rub this salt in your wounds myself .
oh , come on .
where &apos;s the witty repartee ?
if you &apos;re expecting me to reveal so much
as a wince of pain at the hands of your emotional torture ,
you can forget it .
well ...
color me disappointed .
don &apos;t be , conrad .
when i choose to react , you &apos;ll know it .
and i guarantee that you &apos;ll not just regret
each and every one of your petty little torments ,
but that the suffering you so glibly spread around
will come back at you tenfold .
charlotte , it &apos;s emily .
has something happened with daniel ?
no . we &apos;re still waiting .
how are you ?
i &apos;m all right . come in .
what &apos;s all this ?
my version of ...
father @-@ daughter time .
my mom won &apos;t tell me anything about him ,
so this is everything i could find on public record
and some that isn &apos;t .
i found this hidden in the lining
of my mother &apos;s jewelry box .
look at the date .
april 22 , 2002 .
the day he died .
i wonder where she got this .
he doesn &apos;t look like a monster , does he ?
no .
he looks scared .
that &apos;s what i think , too .
i have to get to school .
there &apos;s a journal missing from the infinity box .
how do you know ?
because he &apos;s holding one in a picture
taken the day he died .
what picture ?
the photograph isn &apos;t the point , nolan .
it &apos;s the journal and the fact
that my father trusted you with the box first .
ems ...
i gave you everything that your father asked me to give you .
i mean ...
why would i hold something like that back from you ?
i don &apos;t know .
you tell me .
i &apos;ll call you right back .
i was only honoring your father &apos;s wishes .
do you know how sick i am of hearing you say that ?
it &apos;s the truth . i swear .
in the last few months of his life ,
your father was paranoid and terrified and--
and what ?
and he wouldn &apos;t have wanted you to remember him like that .
i promised that i would protect your father &apos;s legacy ,
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve done .
from now on , you stay the hell out of this nolan ,
or i swear to god , i will make sure that you do .
&quot; from the moment of my arrest ,
i sat stupid and trusting ,
believing in a system rigged against me
by the people that i knew as friends
in a life that i can no longer remember . &quot;
&quot; the closer i get to the truth ,
the louder the whispered voices around me ,
plotting my execution ,
choosing the time . &quot;
&quot; i now know that i &apos;m trapped in a race between fate and freedom . &quot;
&quot; whichever wins out , i won &apos;t go quietly , not again . &quot;
&quot; c.m. will come tomorrow with proof . &quot;
c.m. ?
c.m.
c.m.
&quot; carole miller . &quot;
2002年4月24日辞世
jack , don &apos;t worry .
declan is barely a blip on the graysons &apos; radar at this point .
what about emily ?
does she have any idea what she &apos;s about to marry into ?
well , emily &apos;s not exactly in the mood
to absorb any more negative grayson press right now ...
especially from me .
but maybe she would listen to you .
do you have a to @-@ go cup , by the way ?
why ? where have you gotta be ?
well , contrary to popular belief ,
i do have a multinational company to run .
i &apos;m gonna be gone on business for a few days .
all right . bye , jack .
call me .
missed a pop quiz in econ .
laws of supply and demand .
i think i understand the concept .
make this one last , char .
my dad &apos;s gonna start missing his scrip pad .
you &apos;re not the only guy in school with connections , adam .
but i better be the only one you &apos;re giving it up to .
sorry .
bad day .
you gotta stop blowing off class .
people are starting to talk .
let them .
i &apos;ll pull it together
when this nightmare with my brother is over .
until then ...
what are you staring at , wharf rat ?
nothing .
can we talk ?
no .
let &apos;s get outta here , adam .
new mercy hospital , archives .
hi there . i &apos;m just wondering , uh , what are your hours ?
7 : 00 @-@ 4 : 00 , monday through friday .
if you &apos;d like to request a medical record ,
i can mail you a legal form .
no , that &apos;s all right . i &apos;ll come in and get one later .
jack .
come on in .
how are you ?
actually , that was gonna be my question to you .
can i get you something to drink ?
no , i &apos;m fine . thank you .
it can &apos;t be easy ,
waiting to hear about daniel &apos;s fate .
no . no , none of it &apos;s easy .
you &apos;d think that a written confession by someone
would be enough for the judge to drop the charges , but ...
not to mention the bloody hoodie they found in his possession .
it &apos;s kind of amazing ...
the way it all worked out , don &apos;t you think ?
how do you mean ?
just ...
the graysons are very powerful people .
maybe the protesters aren &apos;t as far off as you might think .
jack , daniel didn &apos;t kill tyler .
i &apos;m not saying that he did .
then what are you saying ?
that there are some things you might want to think about
before marrying into that family .
emily , there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
oh , excuse me .
hello .
they dropped all charges .
oh , thank god .
okay , i &apos;ll be right there .
jack , i &apos;m ...
sounds like good news . you should go get him .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to--
no , no , i &apos;m sorry . i practically ambushed you .
we can talk later .
you &apos;ve had my business card for over six months .
timing is everything , mr. mcgowen .
and now that you &apos;ve cashed out your shares of grayson global ,
is it safe to assume
that the stars are properly aligned for you ?
nearly .
i want full immunity in exchange
for the information i &apos;m about to give you .
i can &apos;t guarantee anything
till i know what we &apos;re talking about .
if you can &apos;t offer me protection ,
i &apos;m more than happy to go to your superiors at the s.e.c. ,
or to the director of the fbi , the cia ,
or any other agency who would like to lay claim
to the conviction of a domestic terrorist .
a terrorist ?
i thought you had information
about your husband &apos;s corporate malfeasance .
in this case , mr. mcgowen , they &apos;re one and the same .
now do we have a deal or not ?
let me make a phone call .
daniel .
murderer ! murderer ! murderer !
you sure you &apos;re all right ?
you &apos;ve barely said two words .
sorry about your car .
this will eventually die down .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
congratulations , son .
welcome home .
welcome home , daniel .
daniel .
thank god it &apos;s finally over .
no , this is a long way from over .
daniel &apos;s a little shaken .
somebody spray painted &quot; murderer &quot; on my car
outside of the prison .
that &apos;s horrible .
yeah , the press were practically handing out pitchforks at the gate .
he &apos;s not far off .
&quot; the times &quot; are questioning
the veracity of the confession ,
&quot; page six &quot; is running a full @-@ page chronicle
of daniel &apos;s past party @-@ boy ways ,
and treadwell &apos;s anti @-@ grayson blog
is being rerun in every major newspaper .
this story isn &apos;t dying down any time soon .
well , then we &apos;ll starve the beast .
daniel has nothing to hide .
i think the best thing for him to do
would be to get in front of the cameras , tell his story .
she &apos;s right .
the best way to hit this is head @-@ on .
well , all the majors
are practically banging down the door--
&quot; nightline , &quot; &quot; good morning america . &quot;
we can have our pick .
listen , i haven &apos;t slept in over 48 hours .
i @-@ i can &apos;t make that decision right now .
i &apos;m gonna crash for a while , okay ?
yeah , of course . you need some rest .
someone tell charlotte
i &apos;ll give her a big hug when i wake up .
sweet dreams , darling .
you deserve them .
victoria , could i talk with you for a moment ?
of course .
i guess i &apos;ll see you all tomorrow .
yes .
what is it , ashley ?
now that daniel &apos;s been officially released ,
i &apos;d like to formally give my notice .
of course .
i had no delusions that you would return to party planning
after you so aptly showcased your other talents .
unfortunately , i won &apos;t have time
to find you a suitable replacement .
oh , that won &apos;t be necessary .
the hamptons are filthy
with ambitious young girls like yourself .
may i ask where you &apos;ve landed ?
mr. brooks has offered me a media relations position
at his law firm .
ah , well ...
as mr. brooks is still on retainer to us ,
i would like to ask you a favor .
if daniel does indeed grant this ill @-@ advised interview ,
i would like you to remain as our media liaison
until it &apos;s over .
that &apos;s the least i can do for daniel
after all he &apos;s done for me .
莱尔 · 詹姆森
lyle jameson .
doctor , uh ,
this is eve tucker at new mercy hospital .
we &apos;re updating our system ,
and i needed to cross @-@ check our records
before confirming cause of death of a patient we shared .
her name is carole miller .
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t recognize the name .
perhaps it &apos;s because it &apos;s been a long time .
she died here in 2002,
but it has you listed
as her primary care physician in lancaster .
um ... 5 &apos; 5 , &quot;
born in 1950,
type 2 diabetic .
i have a carole thomas matching that description ,
but she &apos;s alive and well .
that must have been a clerical error .
yes , it must have been .
thank you .
can i help you ?
carole miller ?
you have the wrong house .
i don &apos;t think so , ms. miller .
alison rodner from
the department of homeland security .
i need to talk to you about conrad grayson .
you worked for grayson global
as conrad grayson &apos;s personal secretary for 18 years ,
is that right ?
well , you obviously know the answer to that
or you wouldn &apos;t be here .
all right then .
what was the nature of your relationship
with david clarke ?
there was no relationship .
he worked for mr. grayson , not me .
were you surprised to hear that he was convicted
for the downing of flight 197 ?
no one saw that coming .
but you did , didn &apos;t you ?
um , do you take sugar with your tea ?
no .
now ...
let me see that i.d. of yours again ,
and let &apos;s verify that you are who you say you are .
no , no , no , no .
aunt carole ,
just ... put down the gun .
aunt carole ?
what the hell is going on ?
aunt carole , meet , uh ...
amanda clarke ,
david clarke &apos;s daughter .
look , after i dropped out of m.i.t.
and my old man kicked me to the curb ,
aunt carole took me in .
she was the one that introduced me to your dad .
and then you betrayed him .
no , she didn &apos;t .
she was always on his side .
nolan came to me
and told me he had formed a bond with david
while he was in prison
and that he believed that your father had been set up .
so i started investigating grayson global
from the inside out ,
and that led me to a man named roger halsted .
grayson &apos;s senior accountant .
yes , he &apos;s the one
that discovered the discrepancies in the books
that connected conrad to the terrorists .
yeah , i know who he is .
he thought he had enough evidence to hang conrad
and exonerate your father .
then why didn &apos;t you ?
we never got the chance .
when i went to the prison to tell your dad
what carole had learned ,
they were already in lockdown .
david had just been killed .
carole , it &apos;s me .
i need you to do exactly as i say .
get up and walk away from your desk .
do not take your purse .
just act like you &apos;re walking down the hall . do it now !
you &apos;re scaring me .
good .
get in a cab and take it
straight to that place we went that one summer ,
with the horses .
do not stop off at your apartment .
i &apos;ll be waiting when you get there .
so ...
he saved my life .
by faking your death .
tell her about the white @-@ haired man .
there was a man who
visited grayson a handful of times .
now these meetings were always off the books .
the first time i saw him
was a year to the day before that plane went down .
the last time
was the morning your father died .
do you remember his name ?
he never gave it .
but i will never forget his face .
he had a full head of white hair
and ice @-@ blue eyes ,
and there was something so terrifying about him .
and i know he frightened conrad even in the bright of day .
ems ...
i &apos;m sorry .
but i could not give you that last journal .
this is bigger to me than your revenge
against the graysons .
this is my--
family .
i know .
i would &apos;ve done anything to protect mine , too .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i wanted to give you this .
my phone ?
how did you get this ?
i took it out of tyler &apos;s jacket the night he was murdered .
what ?
i &apos;m the one who dragged his body up the beach .
are you also the one who hit me ?
no .
and i didn &apos;t see what happened .
i heard gunshots and i went to the water ,
and tyler was lying there .
i thought it was you ,
and then i heard charlotte and declan ,
and i ... i panicked .
well , so much for your stand @-@ up image ,
you were just gonna let &apos; em fry me ?
i told you ,
i don &apos;t know who killed tyler .
but i do know one thing for certain--
the bloody hoodie they found in lee moran &apos;s car
didn &apos;t belong to lee moran .
it belonged to me .
i think your parents
hired him to break in and steal it from me .
and then what , convinced him to confess to the crime
and hang himself ?
why are you telling me this ?
&apos;cause emily trusts you .
and if she &apos;s gonna spend her life with you ,
you owe it to her not to ignore this .
what are you doing ?
you have no right .
you might want to dial back on that indignation .
you just violated the honor code ,
not to mention state law .
you set me up .
charlotte , you need help .
you &apos;re pathetic !
if i &apos;m getting kicked out of this school ,
so are you .
i &apos;m telling my dad to pull your tuition next semester .
you &apos;re done here .
that &apos;s enough . come on .
don &apos;t touch me !
mr. brooks ,
i thought your work here was finished .
nearly .
i hope you &apos;re not upset that i agreed
to stay and work with the graysons
through daniel &apos;s television interview .
i should be able to start full @-@ time
the day after tomorrow .
i &apos;m afraid that offer
is no longer on the table , ashley .
why ?
victoria warned me you were a little tricky ,
so i did some digging ,
and i know you leaked those photos of daniel to the press .
i did what anyone would do .
you can &apos;t get beyond working for someone like victoria grayson
without breaking a few rules .
i &apos;m sorry .
i waste enough time sifting through my clients &apos; lies .
i have no interest in doing the same with my employees .
grayson .
the feds are here , mr. grayson .
the feds ? what do they want ?
they came with a warrant to seize everything .
what do you mean , everything ?
by whose authority ?
by the authority of the people of the united states .
this is agent mcgowen of the s.e.c. , mr. grayson .
i suggest you set aside tomorrow morning
to come down to the federal building
and answer some questions .
you &apos;re gonna want to bring your lawyer .
daniel .
i thought you &apos;d still be home sleeping .
i think i &apos;ve been asleep long enough .
come here .
you &apos;re still wearing it .
of course i am .
why , are you having second thoughts ?
i thought you might be .
so much has changed .
not to me .
what if those protesters were right ?
what if i didn &apos;t deserve that reprieve ?
what are you talking about ?
what if lee moran
had nothing to do with tyler &apos;s death ?
i don &apos;t understand .
why would a career criminal who &apos;s bold enough
to extort my parents and set me up for murder
suddenly have a crisis of conscience ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe he finally realized he was in over his head .
maybe .
i decided to do that interview tomorrow .
you did ?
i &apos;m so proud of you .
my parents raised me to be a grayson ,
to put my name before everything ,
including the truth .
you don &apos;t need to be that guy , daniel .
maybe this interview &apos;s an opportunity for you to be honest ,
separate yourself from your name .
and if it creates a bit of healthy distance
from your parents ,
then all the better .
i &apos;ll go grab my stuff .
okay .
you &apos;re still up ?
i thought you &apos;d gone to emily &apos;s .
i came back to pick up my things ,
saw your light was on .
you all right ?
uh , no .
i am most definitely
not all right .
it &apos;s nice to have you back ,
but our family is on the verge
of absolute catastrophe , daniel .
and i &apos;d bet the house , if my name were still on it ,
that your mother has everything to do with that .
that &apos;s enough , dad .
i &apos;m sick and tired of the two of you
playing me against the other .
that &apos;s understandable .
you &apos;ve been a pawn in our decrepit marriage
for far too long .
i @-@ i owe you an apology .
no , what you owe me is the truth .
the truth .
do you know why the judge
so kindly granted you house arrest
instead of keeping you at rikers ?
yeah , i nearly got beat to death .
and do you also know that your mother paid someone
to arrange that beating ?
lee moran .
yeah .
the confession he wrote wasn &apos;t real , was it ?
no .
tell me you didn &apos;t have him killed .
no , the kid was in too deep .
dad , come on .
if he &apos;d started talking ,
he would &apos;ve destroyed us all .
oh , come on .
i couldn &apos;t let that happen .
i do what i need to do to protect the family .
i always have .
what did you do ?
before i tell you , i need you to promise one thing ...
that when they finally come to get me ,
that you will do whatever you can to rebuild the company
and take care of your little sister .
i promise .
would you close the doors ?
in order for any of this to make sense ,
i need to start at the beginning ...
with david clarke
and what we did to him and his innocent baby girl .
charlotte .
whatever you want , mom , i don &apos;t have time .
i &apos;m already late for school .
i just got off the phone with the headmaster .
he told me about the suspension .
i guess we can add &quot; teen pill popper &quot;
to the grayson book of shame .
this is no laughing matter , charlotte .
do you see me laughing ?
i see you in pain .
how can i help you if you don &apos;t let me ?
i tried to let you , mom . you weren &apos;t interested .
whatever answers you &apos;re looking for ,
you are not going to find them in a bottle of pills .
and you &apos;re not certainly not going to find them
reading this trash .
where &apos;d you get this ?
i begged you to tell me about my father ,
and you refused .
i had to go searching ... on my own .
oh , sweetheart .
is this why you started taking drugs ?
i don &apos;t know , mom . i &apos;m failing calculus .
you do the math .
looking good .
i missed you last night .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i didn &apos;t realize how tired i still was
until i got over here .
thanks for being so understanding .
have you thought any more about how you want to handle
the interview ?
it &apos;s all i can think about .
daniel , i know it &apos;s a lot .
you talk so much about wanting to be your own man--
what if the man i am is no better than my d.n.a. ?
setting the record straight will help you break free from that .
if you truly don &apos;t want to follow
in your parents &apos; footsteps ,
then don &apos;t .
i &apos;ll try not to take offense at that remark .
a word with my son , please .
i &apos;ll see you out there , okay ?
how i long for the days before emily thorne
and her self @-@ righteous indignation
became part of our daily lives .
well , she &apos;ll learn soon enough .
the downside of taking that kind of moral high ground
is that you have a lot farther to fall .
mom ...
why did the judge grant me house arrest
rather than keep me in prison ?
your safety was at risk . you know that .
and you had nothing to do with it ?
my suspicions were right .
you &apos;re not ready to talk to a reporter .
i &apos;m going to cancel the interview .
i &apos;m not gonna judge you .
just tell me your side of the story .
who has been putting these crazy ideas into your head ?
is it emily ?
your father ?
just tell me he &apos;s wrong .
sorry to interrupt .
daniel , they &apos;re ready for you .
so , daniel ,
48 hours ago , you were in jail
facing a murder one charge .
now you &apos;re a free man . how you doing ?
a lot better than i was 48 hours ago .
just for the record ,
did you murder tyler barrol ?
tyler threatened my whole family .
we struggled for control of the gun ,
it went off , and ...
the next thing i knew , i was knocked out
by the guy who finished the job .
lee moran .
according to his confession .
but the truth is ,
i &apos;ll never know exactly what happened
between lee and tyler on that beach .
i only know how it ended .
we saw your release from rikers on the news yesterday .
&quot; occupy daniel &quot; was even trending on twitter .
are you surprised not only by the public reaction
but by the vitriol directed at you ?
on--on one hand , yes .
but on the other , i- i get it .
people feel disenfranchised and fed up
with the privileged minority
who seem to abide by their own set of rules .
listen , if anyone commits a crime ,
no matter who you are ,
he or she should pay for it .
speaking of which ...
the s.e.c. has issued an order of investigation
of your family &apos;s company , grayson global ,
a company you stand to inherit .
would you like to comment
on the allegations of corruption and fraud ?
my father is the victim of a witch hunt .
the s.e.c. has been harassing my family &apos;s company for months
and is now attempting to trade
on the mistrust the public has of me
to build a baseless case against it .
in my case , the truth came out .
the same will be true for my father ...
who i stand behind as a son
and beside as a partner in business
as i prepare for my role at grayson global .
i hardly know what to say .
thank you .
so that &apos;s your plan ,
to go back to grayson global ?
well , no one said i can &apos;t be my own man
and be my father &apos;s son .
that you are .
daniel , i need you to sign this .
sweetheart , get your coat .
why ? where are you taking me ?
you &apos;re not leaving without saying good @-@ bye .
good @-@ bye , mr. grayson .
well , don &apos;t forget this ...
the key to your new lexus gs .
excuse me ?
you can either drive this out of the hamptons forever
or you can drive it to your new parking space at grayson global .
i can &apos;t speak for brooks ,
but i for one admire someone who doesn &apos;t mind
getting her hands dirty .
as long as you understand that from this point forward ,
our hands will be intertwined .
and what about victoria ?
what both you and victoria have yet to grasp
is just how little she matters ...
to anyone .
so no more collins prep .
no , she told her dad to pull my tuition .
there &apos;s nothing i can do .
there is something i can do .
nolan , nolan , wait .
no , stop .
jack , i want to do this .
once upon a time ago ,
i was lucky enough to ...
have someone take care of me when i needed it .
look , i appreciate that ,
but we should be taking this opportunity
to get away from the graysons .
exactly .
you said you didn &apos;t want declan
to go to collins prep on the graysons &apos; dime .
so now he won &apos;t be .
he still deserves an overpriced education
like everyone else , no ?
barry , my man ...
i need you to cut a check
to collins prep .
every time i come back here ,
my memories always rush back
to the moment i heard he died .
and the first regret i had ...
is how i held you from him .
he would never get a chance to know you or you him .
you can despise me all you want , charlotte ,
but your father ...
he was a good man .
he made one mistake
that led him down a path of destruction .
i guess we have that in common .
there are so many things about you
that remind me of him ...
your eyes ,
your laugh .
do you love me ...
even though every time you look at me , you think of him ?
charlotte , don &apos;t you get it ?
it &apos;s because of that that i love you all the more .
mom , somebody &apos;s been here .
emily .
you okay ?
i could use a drink .
anything in particular ?
dealer &apos;s choice .
i &apos;ll go get the good stuff from the back .
rough day at the office ?
he &apos;s one of them , nolan .
conrad confessed everything to daniel before the interview .
&quot; everything &quot; everything ?
daniel could &apos;ve come clean .
he could &apos;ve ...
ended the whole thing .
but instead ...
he doubled down on grayson .
so what are you gonna do now ?
i &apos;m gonna marry him .
i &apos;m gonna track down the man who killed my father .
and what are you gonna do when you find him ?
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
absolution is the washing away of sin ...
the promise of rebirth ...
and the chance to escape the transgressions of those who came before us .
the best among us will learn from the mistakes of the past ,
while the rest seem doomed to repeat them .
well , the truth is ,
i always liked david clarke .
he was reliable , efficient , good @-@ humored .
i suppose the fact that
he fit in so seamlessly around here
is what made him so dangerous .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. grayson , but that man &apos;s here again .
he won &apos;t take no for an answer .
that &apos;ll be all for today , mr. treadwell .
and then there are those who operate on the fringes of society ...
unburdened by the confines or morality and conscience ...
a ruthless breed of monsters
whose deadliest weapon is their ability
to hide in plain sight .
if the people i &apos;ve come to bring justice to
cannot be bound by the quest for absolution ...
