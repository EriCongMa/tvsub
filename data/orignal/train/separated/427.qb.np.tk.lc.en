they get soggy is all i &apos;m saying .
ben .
hey , you let &apos; em sit too long ,
they taste like mush .
then eat &apos; em when you pour &apos; em .
what if something comes up ?
what if you have to use the bathroom ?
where &apos;s yolanda ?
relax . she &apos;s picking up the chips .
they &apos;re out of guacamole .
i don &apos;t like guacamole .
i got chips .
how are we gonna have chips with no guacamole ?
i have a hypothetical for you .
how long till after you pour your cereal
do you wait to put it in your mouth ?
i don &apos;t eat cereal .
she doesn &apos;t eat cereal .
with an ass like that , she eats something .
that &apos;s enough .
25 even .
what do you think , ben ?
no . i @-@ i &apos;m going home to sleep .
why ? she &apos;d be so nice for us .
come on .
let &apos;s do it , ben .
stop .
what else you gonna do , huh ?
no , i , um ...
come on , guys .
let &apos;s do this , and then you can sleep .
let &apos;s go , ben .
ok .
penelope , you gotta stop staring at her .
prentiss wouldn &apos;t want us to sulk . you know that .
i &apos;m not sulking .
i &apos;m surrounded by testosterone now .
she would also want us to embrace seaver .
i baked .
congratulations ,
gradua ?
kevin ate the &quot; t. &quot;
and the &quot; e. &quot;
come on , you .
listen , i got an idea .
you and i could eat the &quot; u &quot; and the &quot; a , &quot;
and that way it would say &quot; congratulations , grad . &quot;
and here i always imagined you feeding me strawberries .
yes . yes , you do .
thank you .
how you doing ?
all right .
i &apos;m worried about the team .
and strauss thinks that adding a probationary agent
is gonna solve our problems .
seaver knows she &apos;s not replacing prentiss .
i know . and she &apos;s got potential ,
but we need an experienced profiler and we need one now .
have you started looking yet ?
yeah . let me know if you have any ideas .
congratulations , agent seaver .
thank you .
who made the cupcakes ?
i did .
thank you all for coming to my graduation . it meant a lot .
let &apos;s get started .
ok , we &apos;re going to portland , oregon ,
and it &apos;s not for a dead moon concert .
so , jay johnson , a dj , was cutting through an alley
on his way home after leaving a club
when he was bludgeoned by a pipe
and then stabbed 31 times .
his watch , his cell , and his computer were stolen .
that was 2 days ago .
now , early this morning , karen heywood ,
a 30 @-@ year @-@ old nurse ,
she died during a home invasion .
she was stabbed 40 times ,
but first she was bludgeoned with weapons of opportunity .
8 different ones , to be exact .
that &apos;s too many weapons for one person .
there was a left- and a right @-@ handed killer
according to the m.e. report .
yeah , but 8 different weapons .
so we &apos;re looking for a group .
yeah , it seems that way .
and the left @-@ handed wounds were deeper than the right .
maybe a woman was involved ?
or a weak man .
anything taken from the house ?
according to a neighbor , just some random stuff--
a computer , some jewelry , a framed picture of a lily .
and pawnable items .
what do we have , serial @-@ killing crooks ?
sounds like a musical .
similar victimology-- young professionals killed 3 miles apart .
is there a gang situation in portland ?
minimal . this seems more like desperate people
in need of quick cash .
why kill them if it &apos;s just for the money ?
that &apos;s what we have to find out .
and we &apos;ve got 8 hours till nightfall . let &apos;s go .
what the hell you doing ? i &apos;m trying to sleep .
2 : 00 a.m. in the afternoon , buddy .
you want some , baby ?
no , i want-- i want to sleep .
not until you get cleaned up .
lizette reese wrote ,
&quot; the old faiths light their candles all about , &quot;
&quot; but burly truth comes by and puts them out . &quot;
so both victims around the same age and killed at night .
one in an alley on the way to his car ,
the other in her home
after coming from the grocery after work .
there &apos;s extreme overkill in both .
overkill usually implies a personal relationship .
or it could mean that the victim represents
someone for whom the killer has extreme anger .
these unsubs are night owls ,
stalking and killing other night owls .
and they &apos;re also disorganized .
in one they subdued their victims
by hitting them with a pipe found at the scene ,
and in the other they used a knife ,
followed by 7 other items found in the kitchen .
a doorstop , even a ceramic cat .
all of this just to steal ?
when a gang mentality sets in ,
unsubs become more capable of heinous acts .
it &apos;s still odd . the incidence of robbery
is so low in this area .
that &apos;s why i started working a geographical profile .
first things first , i factored in journey to crime distance .
if you look here ,
you &apos;ll see that this area of portland
is well within the expected 5 @-@ mile radius .
i also factored in distance of decay .
what does distance have to do with decay ?
it &apos;s how geo @-@ profilers measure relative probability
of an offender traveling outside his comfort zone .
unsubs prefer to stay in an area that they know well .
like you &apos;d commute to work or to the gym .
the closer the crime scenes , the greater likelihood it is
that the unsub lives or works nearby .
based on my algorithm ,
the unsubs either live or work in the area .
your sink needs a new washer .
you got a washer in here ?
no . i don &apos;t work for you .
you sure about that , ben ?
maybe we should do a home store run .
just put a bowl underneath it .
aw , come on . laziness is next to slothfulness , ben .
there &apos;s a 24 @-@ hour home store near the freeway .
come--come on , guys .
get your keys .
no .
are you back @-@ talking me ?
i just--i don &apos;t feel like going .
i don &apos;t care how you feel .
now get your keys and let &apos;s go .
the neighborhood &apos;s very concerned .
detective , did your people process the crime scene ?
we wanted you to take a look at it .
maybe you &apos;ll see something we missed .
the m.e. &apos; s report says
she died after the second stab wound
because they hit an artery .
the other wounds didn &apos;t bleed .
so why inflict 38 more ?
we see it sometimes with groups .
the fact that others are involved
helps each of them rationalize their own violent behavior .
like manson and the genocide in darfur .
these unsubs like the feeling of killing .
they get a high from the adrenaline release .
yeah , but that lasts only as long
as the victim keeps struggling .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
so mr. johnson exits the nightclub
through the back door to get to his car .
maybe one unsub can watch from over there
and the other from back there .
then when he gets here , another unsub hits him with a pipe
and it &apos;s game on .
look at the vials , reid .
this is a drug corridor .
that would explain why there &apos;s so much overkill .
maybe they were on something .
on the jet i did some research into the club .
a year ago , someone o.d. &apos; d inside .
since then , new management &apos;s clamped down on the partying .
which means the unsubs most likely fit in to this area .
well , if you can &apos;t party inside ,
then you come out out here .
they &apos;re probably all the same age .
yeah , mid @-@ 20s .
i checked the back .
there &apos;s a flat @-@ screen , a desktop , and a bicycle .
now , if this group &apos;s going for pawnable items ,
why take a picture of a lily and other random things ?
maybe they ran out of time .
it &apos;s not a busy neighborhood .
is the tv bolted down ?
no . so a group of unsubs would have grabbed it .
what if we &apos;re looking for a single unsub ?
you think all these footprints were made by one person ?
a group so disorganized wouldn &apos;t do something
as hyper @-@ organized as wearing the same shoe .
no , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a group .
i think it &apos;s one very erratic killer .
i &apos;ll let morgan know .
you &apos;re sure you didn &apos;t see a group here that night ?
no . just that woman and a few other people ,
but no groups .
look , if our cameras worked , you could see for yourself .
is it possible there was a group out in the parking lot ?
it &apos;s a ghost town . nothing happens here that late .
all right , tell me where you saw karen first .
she was buying cookies ,
and then she went to the register .
any other customers there ?
there was one at the other checkout .
why would you have 2 registers open that time of night ?
there was this weird guy , mumbling to himself
and swatting the air like someone was bugging him .
can you ring me up over here ?
no problem .
what did this guy look like ?
regular white dude .
greasy . he was buying salt ,
bag of chips , water .
did this guy and karen interact ?
i have a hypothetical for you .
he said something to her , but she blew him off .
just put her head down and said something dismissive back ?
yeah , that &apos;s it . yeah .
we tend to do that when strange people talk to us .
unfortunately , it can backfire .
yeah , hotch . you were right . he was by himself ,
but he was acting strange , like he was being followed .
reid and seaver went to the club and found that
the first victim was killed in an area of high drug use .
if he &apos;s hallucinating , it could be pcp .
that would explain why he stole random things from karen &apos;s place .
he was out of it .
and the erratic patterns in the stabbing .
the adrenaline rush from the drugs
is probably behind the overkill .
go ahead , garcia .
ok , i checked all the local pawn shops
to see if any of those stolen items had shown up there .
i &apos;m coming up empty .
maybe he &apos;s trading the goods for drugs .
what do you mean , he ? we &apos;re talking about a group , right ?
no , we think it &apos;s a solo addict
who &apos;s hallucinating that he &apos;s not alone .
wow . that is a game @-@ changer .
thanks .
what in hell are you waiting for ? ben !
shut up .
take the friggin &apos; hammer and bang him in the head .
no .
n @-@ not this time .
it &apos;s what we came here to do .
be a man , ben .
i am a man .
take the hammer .
that &apos;s why we went to the home store , ben .
wh @-@ what if i don &apos;t ?
come on ! hurry up !
fine ! stop yelling at me !
do it .
that a boy .
so , the time of death
was about the same as the last two kills .
he &apos;s continuing the postmortem stabbing .
i counted 40 wounds .
he &apos;s accelerating . two kills one day apart .
if he &apos;s on pcp , he &apos;d be so violent
he &apos;d use every muscle he had .
he &apos;d strangle , kick , bludgeon .
the bedroom &apos;s a mess .
we need to find someone who knew the place
in order to figure out specifically what was taken .
hey , guys .
you hear that ?
footsteps upstairs ?
you think they heard something ?
i think the person downstairs did .
gosh , i &apos;ve been in this building 27 years .
now , the worst incident we ever had
was when benjamin headley up in 402
found out his wife was sleeping with the cleaner guy
and shot him in the groin .
ma &apos;am , when did you hear the screaming ?
oh , it was late .
it was around , uh , 3 : 30 .
well , then you must have heard the unsub ,
because according to the m.e. , joe died around 2 : 45 .
the wh @-@ what ? what ?
our suspect , ma &apos;am .
what exactly was the person yelling ?
he said , &quot; i was just a kid . i was a kid then .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to kill anymore . &quot;
was anybody talking back to him ?
i assumed he was yelling into the phone or something .
you know , maybe he was having a conversation
with his hallucination .
was he hearing voices ?
we &apos;re not really sure , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;ve been a really big help , mrs. donolly .
thank you very much .
if you have any more questions for me ,
you know where to find me .
bye .
pcp hallucinations are terrifying .
he wouldn &apos;t want to talk to them .
well , hallucinations from mental illnesses are not violent .
you know he &apos;s in his 20s .
and was acting paranoid in the supermarket .
he sounds like a paranoid schizophrenic to me .
the disease does manifest itself at this age .
what if the people he &apos;s seeing are blaming him for something .
or worse . the voices in his head could be telling him to kill .
baby , it &apos;s not gonna work .
leave me alone !
no , no , that is not gonna cut it .
get out !
oh , we &apos;re never gonna leave .
you should have never hurt us .
i don &apos;t know nothin &apos; about that .
oh , pick up .
ben , she &apos;s not gonna help , buddy .
she can help .
let me be !
ben , is that you ?
yeah , it &apos;s me , mama .
are you upset ?
you sound upset , ben .
i need your help .
what can mommy do to help ?
and are you stuttering again ?
mama , they &apos;re back .
have you taken the medication ?
no , it doesn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m getting sick of these calls , ben .
you can &apos;t hold down a job . you can barely function .
are you praying , ben ?
maybe i should just kill myself .
ben , you need to go to church like i told you .
the church helped you the last time with this problem .
she &apos;s lying , ben . that &apos;s what mothers do .
you stop it .
mama , i need help now .
then find a yellow pages and find a church nearby .
i am sick of these calls and i am sick of listening to you !
no , mama , please don &apos;t hang up .
we believe our unsub is a white male
paranoid schizophrenic who suffers from hallucinations .
since schizophrenic breaks usually occur in your early 20s ,
we believe he &apos;s around this age and that he lives nearby .
we think this unsub is hypervigilant ,
and in this condition ,
he &apos;s unable to travel very far from his home .
he kills at night and is extremely violent .
during the day , he &apos;s most likely a loner .
someone in this state probably can &apos;t keep a job .
we believe something happened to our unsub in his childhood .
childhood voices are telling him to kill ,
or he &apos;s misinterpreting them as doing so .
our unsub has probably been coping until now ,
but a recent stressor brought him back to that childhood incident
and is causing him to act out .
our unsub spends his days wandering ,
trying to fight the desire to kill ,
yet he feels trapped by his hallucinations .
no matter what he does or tries to do ,
the hallucination &apos;s power is greater than his own .
because of his limited social circle as a child ,
it is our belief that the incident
involved close friends or family .
now , once we figure out what happened when he was a kid
and the stressor that recently triggered a relapse ,
we &apos;ll be that much closer
to narrowing down the killer &apos;s identity .
mama said , &quot; ben , they &apos;re not there . &quot;
eyes ...
reid .
we need you all to start searching in this area .
based on previous kills , we know that he strikes at night
and will not retreat until we find him .
hello .
may i help you ?
i need someone to talk to .
let me finish lighting these candles .
what seems to be the problem , sir ?
i &apos;ve been seeing things .
they &apos;re blaming me for the fire .
who , son ? what fire ?
an eye for an eye ?
i need you to get rid of them .
what would you like me to do , son ?
when i was 10 , the church , they helped me .
what did they do for you ?
they prayed for me .
gather &apos; round , all .
god , help this child .
release his demons .
they called my name .
ben !
ben !
ben !
ben !
they told me i &apos;d be freed .
ben ! ben !
ben ! ben !
ben ! ben !
ben ! ben !
ben ! ben !
they poured water on my head .
they performed an exorcism on you .
i need you to do it again .
what you have is a medical problem , not a spiritual one .
i &apos;ve been to a doctor .
churches don &apos;t perform exorcisms anymore .
i need you to make an exception .
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t do--
son !
i need help !
i need help !
son . son !
son , calm down .
you know , that profile kind of makes it sound like
schizophrenia leads to serial killing .
that &apos;s not what we said at all , reid .
you know , my mom has schizophrenia .
there are many different types .
i know that .
catatonic , disorganized ...
just because someone suffers
from inability to organize their thoughts
or they can &apos;t bathe or dress themselves ,
it doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;d stab someone
in the chest 30 times postmortem .
reid , what &apos;s really going on ?
our unsub &apos;s hallucinations aren &apos;t fractured
like a typical schizophrenic .
they &apos;re vivid and clear ,
leading me to believe that we &apos;re missing an important variable .
rather than making crazy conjectures ,
i think we should be trying to figure out what it is .
ok , listen to me .
i know this is a scary age for you .
it &apos;s when schizophrenic breaks happen .
have you talked to anybody about this ?
emily .
have you seen a doctor ?
they all say i &apos;m fine .
then why don &apos;t you believe them ?
because predicting one &apos;s chances
of developing a genetic condition
are like finding a penny in an ocean .
i have terrible headaches . i can &apos;t sleep at night .
i can &apos;t focus on our cases .
i only read 5 books last week .
come on , kid , you gotta cut yourself some slack .
you &apos;re also depressed about prentiss ,
and i get it--we all are .
reid , i miss her every day .
but if your mind was splitting ,
do you really think you &apos;d be able to figure out
that this team is missing a variable ?
i &apos;m just speculating that we are .
you need to prove it .
ok , then you do that .
the moment you are wandering around the streets aimlessly ,
that &apos;s when i &apos;ll be concerned about you .
come on , pretty boy . let &apos;s get to work .
had you not used that lighter , ben ,
none of this would have happened .
ben , i said wait up !
sir , don &apos;t let &apos; em on , please .
don &apos;t let &apos; em on .
you can &apos;t run , ben .
no , they &apos;re lying .
go sit down , kid .
because of hippa laws ,
i can &apos;t get information on 20 @-@ something @-@ year @-@ olds
who &apos;ve had schizophrenic breaks .
then check police records . maybe he &apos;s been arrested .
oh , i should have thought of that . blame the fumes . ok .
hey , 6 kids have been locked up in the last month
within a 40 @-@ mile radius .
any of them for theft ?
um ... mugging ,
lewd behavior , car theft .
all right , go through personal information .
maybe they &apos;ve had run @-@ ins with the law when they were younger .
yes , sir , i am on that .
you know , at the grocery store where karen heywood was shopping
the night she was murdered , the clark said the unsub
was buying water and a lot of salt .
saltwater could be used to torture his victims .
well , there &apos;s no evidence of that .
it could also be used to remove victims &apos; blood from clothing .
think about this , though . the visions that schizophrenics have
can be interpreted as demons .
what do some people do
when they think they have demons inside of them ?
they could get an exorcism .
holy water is used in exorcisms .
what about the salt ?
salt is used in exorcisms and a variety of religious healings .
what are you looking for ?
the number of churches in the comfort zone . 3 .
all right , let &apos;s see if any of them keep their doors open late .
i &apos;m--mm--
i &apos;m n @-@ not hurting an old lady .
come on , if you do it , it &apos;ll help things .
it &apos;s always temporary with you .
i need it to work forever .
pretend it &apos;s your mom ,
the mother who &apos;s sick of listening to you .
d @-@ do you promise that you &apos;ll go away this time ?
have we ever lied to you , ben ?
he came here in duress
about ... 2 hours ago .
what did he say ?
he said ... he said voices were blaming him for a fire ,
and he needed me to get rid of them .
you &apos;re right . he thinks he &apos;s haunted .
did he ask you for an exorcism ?
yes . he claimed his mother had taken him to get one
when he was young .
and what did you tell him ?
i couldn &apos;t do it .
throughout history , people have confused
poession with mental illness . some still do .
nowadays , most churches turn
people like him over to medical professionals .
i &apos;m assuming he didn &apos;t take your rejection well .
he was very angry .
but he didn &apos;t attack you ? he didn &apos;t threaten you in any way ?
he &apos;s probably gotten help from the church before .
was there anything else about his behavior that you found odd ?
like something he maybe said or did ?
no . i told you everything .
oh , there is one thing .
he had a stutter .
ok , well , let me know what you find , garcia .
psychogenetic stuttering begins in the area of the brain
that controls thoughts and reasoning .
it &apos;s most commonly associated with mental illness .
i checked with the supermarket guy
and the lady at the building , but neither one of them
heard stuttering .
which means it &apos;s either caused
by the schizophrenia medication or maybe it &apos;s situational .
well , the presence of it along with the fire information
should help garcia narrow down her list .
this victim &apos;s a lot older than his other ones , morgan .
she must represent something to him .
maybe his mother who had him exorcised .
now that he can &apos;t get one ,
he &apos;s taking his anger out on a surrogate .
did the emts try to save her ?
no . why ?
there &apos;s a body imprint next to her .
why would the unsub lie down next to a person he &apos;s just killed ?
he slept here .
look at the number of stab wounds .
there &apos;s gotta be over 50 of them .
71 .
do you know how physically exhausting it would be
to stab someone 71 times ?
it &apos;s hard enough to stab someone 10 times ,
but 71--he &apos;d be completely worn out .
he &apos;s accelerated wound counts ,
which means he does it intentionally .
but why ?
wait , that &apos;s it . if you add the increased
number of stab wounds and the fact that he slept here
to the vivid hallucinations
and the unexplainable onset of stuttering ,
you get the missing variable . this guy &apos;s an insomniac .
just as adrenaline makes a person love the feeling of killing ,
once it leaves the body it makes them tired .
he does this all to sleep ?
the insomnia is what makes the hallucinations so clear ,
and sleep is the only release that he has from them .
you said you &apos;d leave .
stop complaining . you slept .
that not how i want to do it !
but it worked . you look refreshed and your stutter &apos;s gone .
move !
you &apos;re not gonna try the pills . they &apos;re a waste .
then maybe he &apos;ll go to the clinic .
yeah , maybe i will !
get the knife and let &apos;s go .
i want to sleep !
you sassing me , boy ?
ben , just get the knife .
i &apos;m not killing anymore !
why are you making this so difficult ?
get off !
get the knife and let &apos;s go .
ok , here we go . i looked at that list of schizophrenics
that have been recently arrested in that 40 @-@ mile radius .
i cross @-@ checked it with ones that have gone to local pharmacies
to get schizophrenia medication like thorazine or prolixin .
any of them have prescriptions
filled for sleeping medication as well ?
yes , one .
ben foster ,
he has a prescription for thorazine and ambien .
it &apos;s likely he uses the money
from the stolen items to buy the pills .
what &apos;s his background , baby girl ?
he moved to portland 3 years ago .
a month ago he was in an apartment fire ,
after which he got a sleeping pill medication
because his insomnia began again .
oh , my . when he was 10,
he was questioned during an investigation
about a fire that killed 3 people .
it could be part of the homicidal triad .
i &apos;m looking at the police report right now .
it turns out 2 months before ,
his mom had a local minister perform an exorcism on him ,
and the 3 people who were killed in the fire
helped perform that exorcism .
was ben charged ?
no . he was acquitted in juvie court .
you got an address ?
uh , 2627 halden way .
what , you thought we had left ?
wishful thinking , huh , ben ?
it &apos;s gonna be all right . it &apos;s ok .
what &apos;s up ?
i think they &apos;re after us . come on !
come on , ben . we don &apos;t want to get caught .
no , no , i didn &apos;t do anything .
if you stay here , they &apos;re gonna get you .
you don &apos;t want that , do you ?
i &apos;m not killing anyone !
that &apos;s not the point . you &apos;re gonna go to jail if you don &apos;t leave .
ben . ben .
let &apos;s go .
fbi !
he &apos;s out back !
up you go !
seaver , let &apos;s go !
go .
come on , man , we gotta hide .
in here !
hotch , we lost him .
we &apos;re gonna check the back alley . come on .
hey , mom , is that you ?
come here .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you two ,
all right ? listen , i need you to shut the curtains .
can you do that ?
can you do that for me ?
come on . come on .
ok .
do it .
ok .
ok . go--
go help her . go help her .
get that one .
help him .
hurry up !
i think we &apos;ve got something at 2218 .
come on , g @-@ get this one .
here , here .
it &apos;s ok .
what do you want to do now ?
i just want to sleep .
no , you can &apos;t sleep .
you promised !
we never promised you that .
you can &apos;t keep doing this .
we just did , ben .
who is he talking to ?
take the little kid out first .
i &apos;m not hurting the kid .
fine , then .
take the girl . she &apos;s useless .
make his stop , please .
there &apos;s no one there .
they &apos;re right there !
ben , drop the knife .
don &apos;t listen to him , ben .
shoot me .
ben , we &apos;re not gonna shoot you ,
but we do need you to put down that knife , ok ?
all right , where are the other people in this room , ben ?
right there . you see him ?
right here ?
were they there for the exorcism ?
i didn &apos;t kill them , though . i didn &apos;t do it .
liar .
and i &apos;m not lying !
ben , they &apos;re dead and they can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
they can &apos;t ?
no , ben . your mind is playing tricks on you .
once you get help , it &apos;ll all stop .
we &apos;re never gonna stop , ben .
yes , you are .
not until we &apos;re done with you .
yeah , ok .
all right , i killed you . i set the fire .
ah , it &apos;s about time . ben !
ben , listen to us . it &apos;s ok .
we &apos;re gonna get you a doctor &apos;s help . i promise you that .
no . the--
the only way that you can help me
is if you do it-- if you kill me .
ben , that &apos;s not true . listen , the only way
we can help you
is if you take that knife
and you stab me in the neck with it .
are you sure that &apos;ll work ?
oh , i &apos;m absolutely sure of it .
put that knife down , ok ?

siddhartha buddha said ,
&quot; it is not his enemy or foe
that lures him into evil ways . &quot;
why are you still up ?
i &apos;ve been looking over ben &apos;s file .
turns out he &apos;d been seeing evil imaginary friends
ever since he was a child .
ben was always a killer .
you think he had schizophrenia ?
he may have suffered from some mental disease ,
but schizophrenia usually presents itself
in your late teen or early 20s .
ben did kill those people in that church fire ,
which is part of the homicidal triad .
and his mother thought an exorcism would get rid of the demons .
the only way you stop a killer is to catch him , seaver .
you know , i always viewed serial killers as monsters .
but ben &apos;s remorse seemed real .
and that &apos;s why i can &apos;t sleep .
i--i can &apos;t get him out of my mind .
does it ever go away ?
luckily it does .
try to get some rest .
ben .
ben ?
ben .
the electroshock therapy worked .
you shouldn &apos;t hear the voices now .
how do you feel ?
good . good .
that &apos;s good , ben .
wh @-@ what are you doing here ?
they said you &apos;d go away .
you don &apos;t want that , do you , ben ?
i @-@ it &apos;s not up to me .
they said i was sick ,
that they &apos;d fix me .
no . our spirits have been with you your whole life , ben .
no . you &apos;ve been with me since the church fire .
