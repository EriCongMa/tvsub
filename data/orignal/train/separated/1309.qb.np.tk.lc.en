the cleaning lady put this in the dryer .
it &apos;s vicuna wool .
who puts vicuna wool in a dryer ?
it &apos;s tight . does it make me look fat ?
yes . you look ginormous .
i can &apos;t believe how fat you are .
what -- what do you weigh ? like 115 pounds ?
116.8 .
wow , no wonder .
really ?
because i &apos;ve been craving carbohydrates lately .
maybe it &apos;s a hormonal imbalance .
maybe you don &apos;t have enough to do .
it &apos;s a little slow .
let &apos;s go to the gym .
yoga .
boxing .
zumba .
beer .
jane
nicole ?
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
that &apos;s dan &apos;s wife .
your old partner in dcu ?
what ? what happened ?
jane , mandy &apos;s been taken .
what ?
joey -- joey saw it .
t @-@ they took her in -- in a car , near her school .
and i @-@ i need dan . i need you to help me .
okay . okay . get frost and korsak now .
did you call 911 ?
yes , yes , and , uh , detective womack from area &quot; e &quot;
said that they couldn &apos;t put out an amber alert .
okay . why not ?
well , because joey just saw a @-@ a blue car ,
and i guess it &apos;s not enough information . look , i need dan !
okay , we &apos;ll get dan . okay ?
vince , vince !
get dan mateo . he &apos;s undercover in dcu .
drug control unit . on it .
yes .
um , can i talk to joey just --just for a sec ?
nicole , let &apos;s go upstairs and get a full description
of what amanda was wearing , list of her friends .
look , i @-@ i can &apos;t leave him . he saw it happen .
it &apos;s fine , mom . i want to help .
nicole , he &apos;ll be safe , all right ?
i &apos;ll have him back upstairs in just a minute .
we got a really great cafe .
you want to go get a cookie or something ?
i don &apos;t want anything .
please just find my sister .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna find her . okay ?
come on . let &apos;s go .
you get real close when you work undercover , you know ?
my life depended on dan ,
and now his daughter &apos;s life depends on me .
i know this is difficult to talk about ,
but i want to go through it one more time , okay ?
okay .
did you see the license plate ? any letters or numbers ?
no . no . just that it was blue .
um , i bet you were looking at your sister , weren &apos;t you ?
yeah . she was really scared .
i &apos;ve never seen her look like that before .
i bet you were scared , too .
so scared .
you know i used to work with your dad ?
i was his partner . did he tell you that ?
no .
well , i bet he &apos;s taught you a lot
about being a detective , huh ?
he says i &apos;m good at it ,
but i should have looked at the license plate .
hey , it &apos;s okay .
can you tell me about the lady again ?
she was driving . i could see her .
what did she look like ? was she caucasian ?
was she african @-@ american ?
she was white . she had brown hair .
i think she was about as old as my mom .
okay . that &apos;s great . can you tell me about the man ?
i don &apos;t know . he was big .
okay . okay .
it &apos;s okay .
hey , you mentioned that the car was blue .
was it a station wagon ? was it a mini van ?
no , no , it was just a regular car .
it was old .
you keep thinking like a detective , all right ?
i don &apos;t know how much i have that .
yes , you have . hey .
yes , you have , okay ?
we &apos;ll be right back , okay ?
ok .
you think we can get anything else out of him ?
he &apos;s been traumatized .
i think if we give him some drawing materials --
you know , it &apos;s a natural form of communication
for children his age .
maybe he can draw something that he can &apos;t verbalize .
ma , you got any crayons ?
yeah .
we need some paper , too .
uh , how about the paper place mats ?
it &apos;s perfect . thank you .
hey . i found dan . he &apos;s on his way .
great . okay .
um , i &apos;m gonna be back in just a little while , okay ?
okay .
just a little bit .
bye .
she told korsak they &apos;re separated .
dan and nicole separated ?
when ?
god , this job just kills every relationship .
nicole ! nicole .
dan !
nicole . why ? why were they alone ?
look , i leave them for 45 minutes
after school so that i can finish work .
she &apos;s 13 . nicole , we live in a city !
well , where were you ? ! you left me with two kids
and a mortgage while you live in your apartment !
because you kicked me out !
hey ! ho ! come on . stop it . stop it .
blaming nicole isn &apos;t gonna get your daughter back .
where is she ? what do you know ?
we got a description on the car ,
and it &apos;s a man and a woman .
a jack and jill ? jane , we &apos;re not gonna get her back !
stop it . yes , we will . all right ?
dan ! we will find her .
three hours !
three hours is the average for abducted kids !
we don &apos;t find her in three hours , she &apos;s dead .
all right . you let me do my job . all right ?
you concentrate on taking care of joey and nicole .
where &apos;s joey ?
he &apos;s downstairs in the cafe
with my mother and dr. isles .
i &apos;m gonna go hold him .
we can &apos;t get a hit on the girl &apos;s cellphone gps .
whoever grabbed her knew enough to remove the battery .
amber alert with mandy &apos;s picture is out now .
it &apos;s all over new england .
okay , good .
how fast can we get her computer and cellphone records ?
fast . it &apos;s a cop &apos;s kid .
last time i saw mandy ,
she ... she was just a little girl , 5 maybe .
where &apos;s nicole ?
korsak sent her home
to get more photos of mandy and mandy &apos;s computer .
i &apos;m working on getting into her social @-@ network sites .
okay .
hey , what are you doing ?
eliminating dan as a suspect .
you think dan snatched his own kid ?
parents are in the middle of a custody battle .
i think we need to make sure
dan didn &apos;t have anything to do with mandy &apos;s disappearance .
korsak , we worked undercover with dan for two years .
how could you possibly think
he had anything to do with this ?
i want to find mandy as badly as you do .
but we got to think like cops ,
not like his friends .
we got to rule him out , jane .
until we do , he &apos;s a suspect .
but joey said there was a woman driving the car
and a man in the backseat . we &apos;re looking for a couple .
i got to make sure it isn &apos;t dan in the backseat .
well , by the time you rule him out , mandy could be dead .
area &quot; e &quot; units are on their way to stony brook .
they just found the body of a young girl .
oh , god .
when did you guys find her ?
uh , 15 minutes ago .
potheads looking for a little nature stumbled on her .
we got here fast
because of amanda mateo .
perfect spot . she could have been laying here for months .
yeah , she was hidden pretty well
in the trench , covered in leaves .
we got lucky , if you can call it that .
first responders moved her ?
yeah . we were all pulling for dan .
hate to see it end like this .
man , i was at mandy &apos;s christening .
so was i.
is that mandy ? !
hey , dan .
is that her ? is that mandy ?
dan . dan . you can &apos;t be here , dan .
dan . you can &apos;t be here , danny !
get off me , vince !
dan !
jane .
let go of me !
is it mandy ?
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t tell .
vince !
let him look .
is -- is that my daughter ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s not her .
who is she ?
how &apos;d she die ?
she was asphyxiated from the application of a slow ,
constant pressure to her trachea .
she looks a little like mandy . about the same age .
how long she been dead ?
not long .
she &apos;s still warm to the touch .
less than two hours .
so she was murdered
right after mandy was kidnapped .
same age , similar build , hair color .
one girl kidnapped ,
another one turns up dead an hour later .
i don &apos;t believe in coincidence like that . do you ?
no .
you think mandy was a replacement for this girl ?
yeah .
is that a shoeprint on her neck ?
it &apos;s a heavy @-@ treaded impression
consistent with that of a work boot .
size 12 .
joey said the man in the car was big .
is it possible that he crushed her trachea with his foot ?
it &apos;s possible .
what the hell ?
maybe she &apos;s bound like that so her kidnapper
could keep her looking like a young girl .
okay , we need to find out who this girl is . now .
there &apos;s a lot of missing kids , jane .
35,000 in new england alone .
it &apos;ll take weeks to track her by her dental records .
well , then , we take a picture of her face ,
and we show it to mandy &apos;s friends and family
and see if anybody recognizes her .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m checking her iliac @-@ crest epiphysis .
she &apos;s older than she appears .
it &apos;s in its beginning stages of fusing .
she &apos;s about 17 .
there &apos;s some type of staining going on with her sweatshirt .
the edges are white .
i &apos;m gonna take a guess , jane .
i @-@ i think this is a mixture of tears and mucus .
look where it is .
yeah , it &apos;s in a weird spot .
i don &apos;t think this is from our victim .
i think it &apos;s from someone else .
what , like she was holding someone against her .
dan &apos;s clear . just saw the video .
his squad had him under surveillance .
he &apos;s doing drug buys the whole time .
thank god . i &apos;m sorry , jane .
no , it &apos;s -- you were right , korsak .
this is tough .
please , maura . we got to find
an i.d. on this girl .
okay ? she could be the key .
you have to help us find mandy .
i really love the way you put the clouds
behind the lighthouse .
can i get you some more coffee ?
no , thank you .
honey , joey , look , i want you to eat something , okay ?
i &apos;m not hungry .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
i have a big bowl of cauliflower
with your name on it .
yeah , he loves cauliflower . right ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i could put some hot sauce
and some asparagus on the side .
yum @-@ yum !
do you have any hot dogs ?
i sure do .
can i have fries ?
yeah .
hey , joey .
hey .
i , uh , brought mandy &apos;s computer .
okay , great . uh , detective frost will go through it .
dan and i -- um , we argued
about whether or not she should have her own computer .
but , i mean , she needs it for school , so ...
i &apos;m sorry , nicole .
oh , wow . she &apos;s so grown @-@ up .
she &apos;s beautiful , nicole .
did i tell you that she , um ...
she plays soccer for school ? she &apos;s really good .
no , i didn &apos;t know that .
she looks strong .
uh , i have a picture that i need you to look at .
okay , yeah . the girl you found ?
yeah .
no , don &apos;t recognize her .
okay .
honey , uh ...
detective rizzoli is gonna show you a photo , okay ?
i need to know if you recognize this girl , okay ?
is she dead ?
yes .
joey , do you know her ?
no .
okay .
would you like some chocolate milk ?
i just want mandy .
i know you do , sweetie . we all do .
it &apos;s been over three hours since mandy was abducted .
it &apos;s an average , jane .
god , she looks so young .
and she &apos;s so thin .
what happened to you ?
well , she has a vitamin @-@ d deficiency ,
uh , atrophied muscles ,
stunted growth , pale skin ,
exhibits signs of malnutrition .
was she held in captivity ?
that &apos;s my opinion .
any signs of sexual assault ?
yes .
she has elevated estrogen and progesterone levels .
she was on birth @-@ control pills .
you know , when i first heard that it was a couple ,
my mind immediately went
to jaycee dugard and elizabeth smart .
how long was she held ?
given my findings ...
i &apos;d say this girl was in captivity
from three to five years .
i &apos;ve arrested hundreds of male sexual offenders .
i &apos;m not saying i understand that ,
but what i can &apos;t ever get my head around
is how a woman could help do this to someone .
well , you have to look at the women as victims , too .
they &apos;re typically very damaged people ,
ripe for abuse .
and the abused becomes the abuser .
exactly .
and they help him ...
create this bizarre version of a nuclear family
with him in the center .
it &apos;s frost .
he &apos;s got mandy &apos;s phone records .
all right . go . i &apos;ll be here .
jane , i &apos;m doing -- i &apos;m doing everything i can here .
i know you are .
help me find mandy .
what am i not seeing that i need to see ?
sweet girl .
i &apos;m so sorry this happened to you .
she had a facebook account , myspace , and twitter .
wow . this generation puts their whole lives online .
yeah , pretty much .
she had it set so that
only her friends could see most of it ,
but there were still some public areas .
so anybody could get a look at her .
afraid so .
got her phone records .
what are those ?
are those social @-@ network sites ?
i didn &apos;t agree to that .
dan , you can &apos;t be in here if you &apos;re gonna interfere .
i &apos;m sorry . what do you have ?
mandy &apos;s phone records .
look , she gets out of school at 3 : 15 , okay ?
she &apos;s supposed to pick joey up and take him home .
he said that she told him to wait at the playground . why ?
well , here &apos;s her last call .
3 : 29 p.m. it &apos;s from her mother .
well , she texts nonstop . where are the texts ?
your wife said she ,
uh , got mandy a new smartphone .
keep going , frost .
well , it &apos;s actually good for us .
i got a whole series of i.m.s.
what &apos;s the difference ?
well , texts go through the phone system .
we can get the phone numbers but not the content .
instant messages go across wireless internet .
so mandy was instant @-@ messaging .
can you see what she was saying ?
yes , and we can track the messages
back to phones and computers .
here &apos;s every screen name
she instant @-@ messaged in the last week .
we got a whole series of i.m.s
between mandy and &quot; suprgurrl97 . &quot;
who &apos;s &quot; suprgurrl &quot; ?
chloe cameron .
that &apos;s her best friend .
&quot; madmandy97 : where are you ? &quot;
&quot; suprgurrl97 : see you at park entrance . come on . &quot;
see you at the park entrance ?
why &apos;s she going to the park entrance ?
that &apos;s the last message there .
but maybe that &apos;s why she left joey .
only chloe can tell us now .
thank you for coming down right away .
it &apos;s okay . anything we can do .
are you gonna find mandy ?
i hope so , chloe .
can you tell us why you
were meeting her in the park this afternoon ?
i wasn &apos;t .
you &apos;re not in trouble , honey .
but we have to do everything we can to find mandy .
why did mandy leave joey at school
to come meet you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you were i.m. &apos; ing with her right after school .
we have the records .
no . i @-@ i wasn &apos;t .
chloe , you two are texting all the time .
please , just tell the detectives .
we don &apos;t text anymore , mom .
mandy got a new phone so we could i.m.
and what did you i.m. ?
i told you . i didn &apos;t .
i had volleyball practice right after school --
no phones allowed .
okay .
can you take a look at these messages between you and mandy ?
that &apos;s not me .
look . there &apos;s a &quot; u. &quot;
i &apos;m &quot; suprgrrl . &quot; g @-@ r @-@ r . no &quot; u. &quot;
someone was pretending to be chloe .
to lure mandy to the park .
they knew her eye would skate right over that extra &quot; u &quot;
while she was i.m. &apos; ing her best friend ,
just like ours did .
this whole thing has been a setup from start to finish .
and i don &apos;t get all this texting and you @-@ ing and i &apos;m @-@ ing and
i.m. &apos; ing .
whatever .
but i &apos;ll tell you one thing .
that kid was stalked .
whoever took her knew everything about her ,
right down to her best friend &apos;s handle .
screen name .
okay , will you stop correcting me
and think about what it means ?
it means she was targeted .
i mean , they knew her schedule down to the very minute .
they even got her to ditch her little brother
so they could get her alone .
still might be better than a random snatch .
how ? random , they kill her .
this kind ? they use her , abuse her ,
like jane doe downstairs ,
then kill her .
i &apos;m just saying it buys us some time .
god , i hope so .
okay , we got a counterfeit screen name -- suprgurrl97 .
already trying to track it .
jane , i want to show you something .
blunt @-@ force trauma to the right side of the body .
so her right side was facing her attacker .
yes , but there &apos;s no bruising on her left side .
why is that significant ?
so she was fighting like this .
she was left @-@ handed , jane .
yeah . i &apos;m left @-@ handed .
why would i expose my weaker side ,
defend myself with my weaker right hand ?
exactly . you wouldn &apos;t .
unless you were holding something ...
or someone .
the tears on the sweatshirt .
she might have been holding someone close
with her stronger arm
as she fought off her attacker .
it &apos;s mandy . it -- it fits the timeline .
oh , god .
she died trying to protect a complete stranger .
the dna from the tears will tell us if it &apos;s mandy .
well , we don &apos;t have that kind of time .
i mean , w @-@ what about her other clothing ?
i mean , maybe there &apos;s something on that
that connects this girl to mandy .
everyone is working all night on this .
i promised dan that we &apos;d find her .
i know she &apos;s out there , okay ?
we can &apos;t let her end up like this girl .
we just can &apos;t .
got something , dr. isles .
a positive match on the hair we found on the jeans .
who does it match ?
amanda mateo .
she &apos;s alive , maura . i know she is .
so , this guy lurks online ,
watching young girls chat with each other ?
like shooting little fish in a barrel .
they have no idea how vulnerable they are .
did you find this bastard online ?
who is he ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
well , tell me what you do know , jane ,
because what i &apos;m thinking in my head is far worse
than anything you can say .
we know he was chatting with mandy for two days ,
pretending to be chloe .
he knew her schedule .
did he know her dad wasn &apos;t around ?
come on .
got an i.p. address .
it &apos;s a cafe with free public internet service .
public internet service . great .
wait . no . washington street .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s like a quarter @-@ mile
from where we found jane doe &apos;s body .
got to be his stomping ground .
that &apos;s something , dan .
it &apos;s not enough .
w @-@ where you going ?
to find her .
let him go , jane . he needs something to do .
where you going ?
check on nicole .
all right . thanks .
hey , maura , look for anything on jane doe
that can narrow down a location around stony brook .
okay , thanks .
how about i give you and joey a ride home ?
i &apos;ll call you the second we have something .
no ! i &apos;m not going anywhere until you people find my daughter !
let me make you a cup of coffee .
thank you .
sorry , vince . that was harsh .
nah , it &apos;s all right .
you can yell at me anytime you need to .
dan blames me .
i blame me .
where is he ? where is dan ?
he &apos;s out in the streets , doing what he does best , nicole --
digging , looking for amanda .
that &apos;s what i want to do .
i want to look for her . i want to scream her name .
i can &apos;t leave joey , though .
the job ...
it &apos;s crushed him ...
crushed me .
hey , i &apos;ve had three wives leave me because of the job .
it &apos;s hard being married to a cop .
dan just kept doing deep @-@ cover drug assignments ,
disappearing on us .
the job was more important to him than we were .
that is not true , nicole .
it sucks you in .
and it &apos;s who he is .
ah . i know .
i just feel so alone all the time .
i mean , even --
even before we split up , i felt like a single mother ,
raising our kids without him .
and i know that he loves them .
he loves you , too .
i made a fresh pot .
please eat .
you &apos;ve really been so kind .
but you can go home .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i &apos;m part of a cop family , too .
she has fluorosis of the enamel --
discoloration of her permanent teeth .
she grew up in an area with high concentrations
of natural fluoride in the water .
well water .
yes .
so she &apos;s from a rural area or a farming community maybe .
yeah , but we got to narrow it down more than that .
frost has already been through over
a thousand missing @-@ children reports .
we &apos;ll start with massachusetts .
try worcester county ,
berkshire county , hampshire county .
okay , slow down . slow down . uh ...
no missing kids in worcester county
matching jane doe &apos;s description .
what are you doing ?
checking water @-@ quality reports
in massachusetts and surrounding states .
nothing in hampshire county or berkshire county .
maybe if i narrow down the search parameters
to 1.4 milligrams per liter .
okay , that helps .
here it is . what about , uh , windham county , connecticut ?
windham county .
anything ?
maybe . 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl disappeared four years ago .
maura , didn &apos;t you say she was about 17 years old ?
frost , you got a picture ?
right here .
there she is . sophie james .
sophie james .
she &apos;s been missing four years .
i &apos;m gonna call her family ,
have them come get her and take her home .
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be .
her mother and i have been praying for a long time
to get this phone call in the middle of the night --
just to know .
it &apos;s hell ... to not know .
i understand .
that &apos;s sophie .
that &apos;s my daughter .
can i go to her ?
sure .
i &apos;m so sorry , mr. james .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been carrying this around for four years .
it &apos;s her dental records ...
photos .
where &apos;s she been ? who took my daughter ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
i saw another family upstairs .
they &apos;re missing a child , aren &apos;t they ?
yes .
a girl , 13 .
we , uh ...
think your daughter might have been killed
trying to protect that girl .
that sounds like my girl , sophie .
find that girl , will you ?
don &apos;t let those parents go through this .
anything ?
no , not yet .
you were right . he just keeps on drawing .
oh , wow . i like how the waves move against the lighthouse .
did your family take a vacation in maine ?
my dad &apos;s always working .
no . no , we &apos;ve never been . why ?
i guess you like lighthouses , then , huh ?
not really .
joey , let me see .
he is drawing a lot of lighthouses .
he &apos;s never done that before .
joey ...
is this the car that took mandy ?
look at the smoke . what &apos;s the smoke from ?
from the back of the car .
tailpipe .
no , it &apos;s the muffler .
joey , d @-@ did the car sound like ,
&quot; pop @-@ pop , pop @-@ pop , &quot; like that ?
mm @-@ hmm . it was loud .
the car had a broken muffler .
uh , nicole , can i borrow your laptop ?
yes , of course .
well , maybe he saw the license plate ,
but he doesn &apos;t realize it .
okay .
did the blue car maybe have a connecticut license plate
that looked like this ?
yeah . maybe .
i &apos;ll let you know if we find something .
good job .
frost , track connecticut vanity plates ,
the lighthouse ones .
see how many were cited for defective equipment in the last month .
i think the kidnappers &apos; car had a bum muffler .
think we &apos;re gonna find her on that ?
hey , they caught the son of sam on a parking ticket .
state troopers are relentless on equipment @-@ violation tickets .
found two -- a 2000 minivan ...
and an &apos; 89 dodge dynasty .
it &apos;s blue , jane .
who &apos;s it registered to ?
heidi rodman , 35 .
show me her face .
where &apos;s amanda ?
you got the plate , korsak ?
yeah , putting out a bolo on it .
we &apos;ll have every cop in the state on it in two seconds .
hey , put out a bolo on a connecticut plate --
936 @-@ romeo @-@ zulu @-@ baker ...
let &apos;s get all the locals to her new london house .
it &apos;s not gonna help .
why ? y @-@ you &apos;ve got her address right there .
800 harbor view drive .
it &apos;s bogus . the address is to a shopping mall .
oh , damn it . is she married ?
no marriage certificate on file . no joint accounts .
all right , print up her driver &apos;s @-@ license photo .
i want to show that to joey .
you got it .
take your time .
that &apos;s her .
great job , joey . you did good .
we &apos;re gonna get her .
it &apos;s her . joey made her .
yeah ! good .
is that operations ?
yeah .
korsak . what do you got ?
come on , please .
okay . thanks .
walking beat just spotted the car
parked on river street in stony brook .
yes !
frost , call dispatch .
have the walking beat keep an eye on that car .
keep everybody out of that area .
we &apos;re gonna follow heidi rodman straight to amanda .
bring her home .
there it is .
walking beat &apos;s keeping an eye on it .
have they spotted the driver yet ?
no .
well , then , we wait .
and that car will take us straight to mandy .

mandy and sophie both played soccer .
is mandy left @-@ handed ?

the dominant hand , is holding the soccer ball .
sophie was left @-@ handed .

he &apos;s targeting left @-@ handed soccer players ?
come on , maura . that &apos;s just crazy .
i don &apos;t know .
the alphabet killer went after girls
who had the same initial in their first and last names .
and there &apos;s a lot of mythology
associated with left @-@ handedness
that might trigger something in a sociopath .
the devil is often portrayed as being left @-@ handed .
yeah , but mandy and sophie lived 100 miles apart .
how would he know if they were left- or right @-@ handed ?
the soccer -- i mean , the coach would know . yeah , look .
mandy played left wing .
