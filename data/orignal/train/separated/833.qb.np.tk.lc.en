what can i get you ?
can i get a beer and a number ?
actually , i &apos;m ...
this woman is engaged .
her number belongs to god now . thank you .
my bad , i didn &apos;t see a ring .
i &apos;m wo-- i &apos;m working on it .
that &apos;s something i &apos;m working on .
can &apos;t just put any ring
on the hand of the most perfect woman in the world .
now shoo .
back to the mechanical shop or wherever it is you work .
enjoy .
thank you .
okay , so you &apos;re doing it again .
i &apos;m doing what ?
ever since we got engaged ,
you &apos;ve been acting insanely jealous .
look , all bartenders get hit on .
it &apos;s just part of the job .
even nick has groupies .
are you free tonight ?
i am , yeah .
me , too !
oh , well , hey , well , i really hope you find something to do .
nick is playing hard to get .
what was wrong with her ?
i just wasn &apos;t feeling it .
what &apos;s &quot; it &quot; ?
it &apos;s obvious . it &apos;s , you know , it &apos;s ...
magic .
what ?
little bit of the magic thing , little bit of the ...
&quot; man stick &quot; ?
i &apos;m not saying &quot; man stick . &quot;
it &apos;s what i heard .
i &apos;m saying &quot; magic . &quot;
i don &apos;t know , i just ... i want magic .
is that so bad ?
i want the music to swell .
i want the wind to blow .
i @-@ i want the clouds to part .
love ! magic !
something exciting !
why are you yelling ?
because i am embarrassed !
don &apos;t be embarrassed , man , i want magic , too .
i want her to have a metal bra ,
and then i got a sword in my hand , and guess what ,
we both wearing skirts .
and we &apos;re riding on flying horses .
that &apos;s more like dork magic .
okay , i don &apos;t want to upset you guys ,
but if you keep looking for magic ,
you &apos;re gonna be alone forever .
did you just say you don &apos;t mean to upset us
and then tell us we &apos;re gonna end up alone ?
i actually don &apos;t care if i upset you .
yeah , &apos; cause that &apos;s really upsetting .
you know , i got to ... i got to say ,
i &apos;m with aly on this one , she &apos;s making sense ,
which is why she always plays &quot; smart cop &quot;
when we play &quot; smart cop / dumb cop . &quot;
not a game we play .
i &apos;m super worried you think we do , terrified .
i feel like we &apos;re playing it right now .
great &quot; dumb cop , &quot; great &quot; smart cop . &quot;
you two need to get realistic .
you &apos;re not getting any younger , nick .
wrong . i &apos;m in the prime of my life .
watch me do my thing .
show her , dude .
get it !
show her what you got , nick .
see it ? see it ?
do you see it ?
is it up ?
can you see it ?
winston , call an ambulance .
i smushed every bone in my back .
looks like you got &quot; old man back . &quot;
welcome to the club .
looks like a cool club .
ugh , you hear that ?
yeah , i &apos;m sitting closer than you .
aly was right .
we are getting older .
ugh , don &apos;t remind me .
i don &apos;t want to be alone forever .
maybe it &apos;s time i start looking
at my love life more realistically .
i feel like one of those characters
in the show sax and the city talking about this .
oh , no , you mean , um , uh , sex and the city .
i &apos;m talking about the one
with the four ladies in a jazz band .
that &apos;s not a show .
carrie , miranda ,
no .
the other one and the older one .
you &apos;re thinking of sex and the city .
they would never allow that &apos; cause of the title .
anyway , man , i &apos;m with you , you know ?
i think we should be more realistic
about who we &apos;re dating .
we got to keep each other from dreaming .
so if you see me dreaming ...
pinch you .
well , don &apos;t pinch me , but just let me know .
let &apos;s make a deal .
let &apos;s make a deal .
i got your back , you got my back .
yeah .
it &apos;s time .
it &apos;s time .
why did y ... ?
reagan lucas to see dr. richards .
i &apos;m so sorry , dr. richards is ...
he &apos;s right behind that water cooler .
why don &apos;t i see any orders
for recombinex from you this month , don ?
well , um ...
what is this ?
spectavir , donny ?
are you kidding me ?
maybe we can talk when you &apos;ve ...
when i &apos;ve had a chance to consult my physician
about the possible side effects of spectavir ?
side effects which include dry mouth and diarrhea ,
wet mouth and constipation ,
butt sneezing , hysterical deafness ,
unwelcomed night @-@ running , dusty semen ...
you know what , why don &apos;t i put in an order for recombinex .
ooh , great , but only if you want to .
anything else i can do for you ?
not unless you can get me
a hotel room downtown for the next month .
my company is putting me
at the redbrick lodge and seafood hut .
my key is a fish .
we have a room-- we have a room available .
i overheard you , sorry-- we have a room .
uh , my name is nick , uh , nicholas for long .
uh , my friend and i have a lovely room for rent
in our loft downtown .
you see , our old roommate is on jury duty .
her name is jess , jessica .
we had a little &quot; will they / won &apos;t they . &quot;
then we did , and then we fought a little bit too much .
we still have a really nice thing .
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
i am truly sorry for my friend here ,
but i am sure it is not realistic
that you would want to rent a place from total strangers .
normally , no , but i have a lobster tank in my bedroom .
we have no lobsters .
what is the rent like ?
what do you want it to be ? i don &apos;t care .
what ?
cheap .
amenities ?
yeah , we got those .
you got a rain shower ? i love a rain shower .
rain shower ? crazy enough , we were installing one today .
well , you are weirdly checking all of my boxes ,
so ... i &apos;ll come take a look .
great , good , the , uh , the address is ...
right here on the form under my name .
great , i &apos;ll see you tonight .
good luck with your ...
&quot; smush pain that feels
like everything came out of the sandwich . &quot;
doesn &apos;t even hurt that much , actually .
nick , this is crazy .
come on , man .
we agreed to not let each other
do exactly this anymore .
do i have to get tough with you ?
just admit it , you &apos;re jealous .
uh , i &apos;m not , i simply want a demographic breakdown
of all the guys who hit on you .
you know , jacked dudes , swole dudes , yoked dudes .
what in megyn kelly &apos;s america are you doing , nick ?
i &apos;m installing a high @-@ end shower .
nick &apos;s got a crush on a girl
who is way out of his league .
do you want a boom box ?
you gonna invite her to winter formal ?
when you &apos;re my age , you don &apos;t form crushes anymore .
i &apos;m past that .
i don &apos;t remember anything about her .
i mean , what , does she have brown hair , brown eyes , a nose ?
she had moxie , she ran the room , she commanded it .
she &apos;s here , she &apos;s here .
all right , guys , make your hair look good .
everybody , make your hair look good , okay ?
don &apos;t embarrass me .
south @-@ facing windows ,
a balcony , stainless steel appliances ,
and i &apos;m guessing someone with extreme ocd
that lives here to keep this place clean .
hello , i &apos;m schmidt .
you were a large child .
that &apos;s incredible .
yes , i @-@ i was obese .
you look familiar .
mtv beach house , 2003 .
oh , my god , reagan ? !
cece , hi .
how are you ?
oh , my god !
i &apos;m so happy to see you .
you , too . you look incredible .
barely recognized you .
well , you &apos;ve never seen me dry .
cece , y @-@ you went to the mtv beach house ?
did you get to announce a video and then scream ?
actually , we both did .
yeah .
and then we hooked up .
yeah , that &apos;s true , too .
is he okay ?
it sounds like there &apos;s a dishwasher in his face .
i know , it &apos;s just , uh ... he &apos;s just processing .
what a turn of events , the fact that you guys hooked up .
you know , that was a big summer for me .
remember , i @-@ i pierced my nose .
i know .
i forgave my mom .
i realized that i was bisexual .
i mean , of course i went for you .
i go nuts for big boobs .
i &apos;m a real melon @-@ felon .
oh , trust me , i remember .
i think he &apos;s having a seizure .
no , no .
it &apos;s just that when he has to process a lot of emotions ,
sometimes he likes to do nick cannon &apos;s solo from drumline .
maybe it &apos;s best if you continue seeing
the rest of the apartment
and i will , uh , make some snacks with schmidt here .
that &apos;s a great idea . reagan , i &apos;ll give you the tour .
winston , you don &apos;t have to come .
no , but i want to .
oh , don &apos;t , you &apos;re too sweet .
and i &apos;m walking away .
you can stay .
it would be my pleasure to come .
i-- literally nobody wants you to come .
right this way .
hey . can we talk ?
one second .
yes , of course .
why , did something of note happen ?
someone i hooked up with once
is potentially gonna live here .
totally fine with it .
okay .
as long as we both agree that open communication
is the key to a healthy relationship .
of course .
just one second .
be right back .
so that &apos;s where you &apos;d put your , uh , body
at night .
alone or with somebody , up to you .
well , i like the room .
i think i just want to get rid of the pillows , the yarn ,
the tote bags and anything else
that makes me feel racist against white people .
that &apos;s everything jess owns , now , isn &apos;t it , nick ?
gone . it &apos;s all gone .
we &apos;ll take care of it .
winston is the loft warrior .
i &apos;m kind of the rock of the group .
really ?
he &apos;s the rock of the group ,
and i &apos;m sure reagan would love to see how the rock lives .
oh , my god ,
it &apos;s worse than i thought .
so this is my room .
i love it , it &apos;s my safe place .
this is where i write my letters to editors .
i &apos;m a writer .
it &apos;s where i also write checks to poor people .
charity is so important to me .
over there , that &apos;s , of course , my bed .
that &apos;s where i dream , that &apos;s where i sleep ,
and , with a lucky lady , i do sex .
do with her .
this is where i do my exercises .
i &apos;m fascinated .
what exercises do you do ?
anything that involves the body , i do .
i &apos;m good , uh , as my coach says ,
horizontally and vertically .
what does that even mean ?
your life coach ?
uh , my trainer , my coach ,
my leader , my guru ...
is that a bowl of mashed potatoes under your bed ?
may god help us if it &apos;s not .
winston , isn &apos;t there anything else
you could be doing right now , like , anything ?
reagan , may i show you the bathroom ?
specifically , the shower ?
shower &apos;s not finished .
i &apos;d love that .
to the left .
was that installed by a child ?
yes , it was .
from a big brother program i initiated .
let &apos;s make it rain for the woman .
she doesn &apos;t need to see it ,
she doesn &apos;t want to see it ...
that &apos;s rude of you . rude .
look ! look at the ...
a little boy came in here and did it .
he &apos;s gonna get better with practice .
well , i &apos;m gonna need a working shower ,
so maybe i should just ...
don &apos;t leave , hold on .
i ... if you leave , the place could be rented .
it &apos;s a hot property .
there &apos;s a lot of applications .
who am i up against ?
a ceo of a major company with computers .
his name is michael ... silvergold .
michael silvergold .
what is his credit score ?
michael silvergold ?
t ... twenty .
twenty ?
five .
twenty @-@ five .
thousand .
okay . just fix the shower .
it needs to be in the center of the ceiling
and water needs to come out of it .
you have a cat , don &apos;t you ?
how &apos;d you know ?
it &apos;s very obvious .
shoot .
hold on , let me see .
okay . you know what ? hold on a second .
we have this new heat @-@ activated antiseptic gel .
you &apos;re gonna love it .
astronauts use it to masturbate .
you are kind . you are brave .
you are a maccabee .
you are daddy &apos;s favorite boy .
you are loved by a wonderful woman .
deep breath in ...
all heart , all action .
movement , direction , directive .
is it working ?
yeah , i feel it getting hot .
oh , that &apos;s because it has whale in it .
so weird .
yeah .
you &apos;re really good at this .
thanks . well , you have good hands .
no !
back off , beach house !
so you &apos;re totally fine , huh ?
are you freaking out because she hooked up with a woman ?
that &apos;s so boring .
not at all .
i completely appreciate the fluidity of sexuality .
i &apos;m basically a woman myself .
you &apos;re losing the thread .
i am freaking out , reagan ,
because you &apos;re trying to steal my fiancé .
no , i &apos;m not .
what are you talking about now ?
everybody knows that there is a window of time
before any wedding where some amazing person
comes out of the woodwork and tries to steal a bride .
it &apos;s the plot of every romantic comedy .
i &apos;m the bridgette wilson @-@ sampras here !
who ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , i suppose you &apos;re both too &quot; cool &quot;
to have seen the wedding planner !
well , i &apos;ve seen it .
you know what ? i didn &apos;t even know that you were engaged .
i didn &apos;t see a ring .
i am working on it !
now get out , and you @-@ you &apos;ve crossed the line !
here &apos;s the line and you &apos;ve crossed over it . out !
no . schmidt , enough .
she &apos;s staying , i &apos;m leaving .
you really don &apos;t trust me , do you ?
just ... cece , pl @-@ please ...
darling , sit ...
that went well for you .
i feel like i didn &apos;t handle that situation correctly .
utilities are not included .
just wanted to make sure
that didn &apos;t get lost in all of this .
damn it .
are you sucking on a block of cheese ?
no .
oh , my god .
here .
take this free sample of antacids .
consider it a parting gift .
i don &apos;t want this anyway .
some weird friend group ... shenanigans .
i can &apos;t get involved .
you &apos;re a real lone wolf , huh ?
new day , new city ?
a real lady costner .
i &apos;m gonna take off .
so , what ? you just light fires and then walk away ?
i &apos;m sorry , are you blaming me
for what happened with you and cece ?
oh , no , no , no .
i &apos;m just saying that it &apos;s all your fault ,
that you caused it .
you &apos;re pathetic .
yeah ? you &apos;re pathetic .
you &apos;re pathetic .
you &apos;re pathetic .
you &apos;re pathetic .
you &apos;re pathetic , you &apos;re pathetic .
i &apos;m amazing .
yeah ? well , then , amaze me .
stay and fix this .
what do you got ?
you can pick one thing .
easy . uterus @-@ shaped stress toy .
not surprised .
this is really helping , thank you .
can i also get the double @-@ sided pen ?
no .
hey , about earlier ...
i &apos;m sorry that i basically let you drown in the shower .
and then called you a soggy little bitch .
i don &apos;t know how to build a rain shower , okay ? !
help me !
i want to help you !
but i &apos;m gonna get wet !
it &apos;s too late for you !
there &apos;s still time for me !
i &apos;m sorry i squirted you with all that shampoo .
it ... it was supposed to be a metaphor ,
but i @-@ i really just panicked , to be honest with you .
i was trying to be tough , but it came off as mean .
no , i appreciate you looking out for me .
i @-@ i &apos;ve got no chance with reagan .
she &apos;s hot and she &apos;s cool
and she &apos;s bisexual .
that means she likes men and women .
i know what bisexual means .
i can &apos;t compete with that .
that &apos;s too many people , winston ,
that &apos;s all the people !
it &apos;s time to stop chasing the magic .
now i &apos;m gonna ask out a girl
who will not stop staring at me .
but why do i feel so nervous ?
you know , i &apos;ll tell you why you &apos;re nervous , my friend :
it &apos;s because you &apos;re human .
because you &apos;re ...
where the hell is my cherry ?
if you are so jealous that you want everyone else to know
that cece is engaged , hey , here &apos;s an idea--
why don &apos;t you get her a ring ?
because i &apos;m afraid that whatever ring i get her
isn &apos;t gonna be good enough .
are you worried that the ring won &apos;t be good enough
or that you won &apos;t be good enough ?
aren &apos;t you smart ?
yeah , well , of course i am-- i &apos;m in sales .
that &apos;s so funny . i &apos;m in marketing .
i don &apos;t care .
cece is definitely too good for you .
i know .
no , but seriously .
like , she &apos;s way too good for you .
no , i know that .
like , you should have never had a shot .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
no , trust me . i said , like ,
i @-@ i &apos;ve known this the whole time .
i understand quantum physics more than
i understand how you ended up with cece .
don &apos;t you understand that this is the problem ,
and i don &apos;t understand where i got to where i am right now ?
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m sorry .
and i &apos;m all turned around .
i &apos;m sorry , let me try and fix it .
you have two choices .
you can either spend the rest of your life
terrified that somebody &apos;s gonna swoop in and steal cece away
or you can just love her ,
and thank the universe that she loves you back
for some reason .
i know what i have to do .
come on , we got to go find cece .
you got to go find cece .
you &apos;re in this now , too , baby .
you &apos;re responsible for my marriage .
don &apos;t you ever call me &quot; baby &quot; again .
you want to make this about you , reagan ?
your car , i &apos;m driving .
my car , i &apos;m driving .
your car , i &apos;m driving .
my car , i &apos;m driving .
your car , you &apos;re driving .
exactly .
i said the wrong thing .
jen just agreed to go out with me
any time , any day , anywhere .
how do you feel ?
totally fine , bordering on no feeling at all .
ah , yes , the sweet spot .
she seems really angry . we ... we should probably go .
go !
okay , i thought you were giving me a hug .
oh , hey , schmidt .
be careful , okay ?
there &apos;s a guy over there that brought me flowers .
i might realize that i &apos;m in love with him and run away .
does he come in here often ?
an unfortunate start .
look , i &apos;m sorry for not being open with you .
the truth is @-@ is i still can &apos;t believe
that you &apos;re gonna marry me .
you spent the summer of 2003 at the mtv beach house .
i spent that same summer watching felicity on vhs
and recording a fake radio show where i reviewed snacks .
i love you .
and i know you love me .
and so ...
i give you my trust .
you &apos;ve always had it .
and i don &apos;t feel the need
to show the world that i own you
by putting some gaudy gem on your hand .
i love you .
but you are getting me a real ring .
you &apos;re gonna have a diamond the size of a raisin .
we can go tomorrow .
we &apos;ll pick it out together .
i did that .
hey , nice job .
thank you .
let me get you a drink .
hold on .
why don &apos;t you
take it easy , smush pain , i got it .
that is a perfect old @-@ fashioned .
i know .
magic .
magic !
that was magic .
okay , you guys saw magic .
i watched a hot girl pour herself a drink
and then leave without paying .
wait , she left ?
she &apos;s a robber .
nick has a crush on a robber .
how did she leave so fast ?
she &apos;s amazing .
guys , we got to go get her now .
let &apos;s go .
cece , let &apos;s go !
ah , son of a ...
schmidt , i &apos;m coming !
let &apos;s get her ! come on !
let &apos;s go !
uh , you coming ?
oh , i would .
but i have to stay here and eat pretzels .
okay , i &apos;ll call you with an update .
no .
i &apos;ll text you with an update .
don &apos;t .
uh , ma &apos;am , we &apos;re surprising her
because we want her to move in with us .
see , earlier i said , &quot; get out ! &quot;
and she did .
which was an embarrassing mistake by me .
i don &apos;t speak english .
oh , where are you from ?
um , outside of connecticut .
this is a good idea .
great idea .
this is a great idea .
i &apos;m very excited .
we want you to move in with us !
9.9 miles ...
this just got creepy .
why did we do this ?
i personally did it
because i thought the idea was cinematic .
how loud is her music ?
we just have to get out of here quickly
and quietly ... we can , we can go out the window .
nobody &apos;s going anywhere .
we &apos;re not leaving without her . i got this .
oh , no , no , no . what are you doing ?
no , nick .
i got it .
nick , don &apos;t .
what are you doing ?
i got it .
nick .
get off me !
nick ?
what are you doing here ? !
thank you for the swift kick to the face .
perhaps you want to live in our place .
genuinely didn &apos;t rhyme on purpose .
i think what he &apos;s trying to say is ,
we want you to come live with us .
yeah .
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m okay here .
i actually worked it out so that i get to pick out
a lobster to eat at the end of every week .
it &apos;s a sick deal .
you know what &apos;s a sick deal ?
friendship .
that &apos;s an unacceptable segue way .
i actually like being a loner .
it means fewer people break into my hotel room .
okay , well , if you &apos;re such a loner ,
then why did you help me with cece ?
i don &apos;t know .
you could &apos;ve left when i kicked you out .
you could &apos;ve left when you caught me
beasting that hunk of cheese .
that was disgusting .
but you stayed .
now i &apos;m not leaving .
and cece &apos;s not leaving and nick ...
well , nick physically can &apos;t leave .
winston &apos;s not leaving .
hey , i &apos;m winston , by the way .
none of us are leaving until you agree to move in with us .
this is actually the kindest ,
creepiest thing that a group of people
i &apos;ve only known for four hours has ever done for me .
ah , screw it .
i &apos;m gonna move in !
yes !
okay , you &apos;re gonna hug ,
we &apos;re gonna hug ?
okay . yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s happening .
i can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on ,
after being kicked in the head .
but i &apos;m picturing a very happy scene .
oh , no !
help me , reagan !
i don &apos;t know how to turn it off !
oh , my ...
the handle-- it &apos;s too tight !
let &apos;s try it together .
it &apos;s so wet .
i can &apos;t get a grip on it .
is this hot ?
yeah . that &apos;s hot .
yeah ! that &apos;s hot .
got it . it &apos;s too wet .
it &apos;s slippery .
reagen , this is where you put your ...
i &apos;m getting you with my teeth .
yeah .
ok .
ok .
the bathroom isn &apos;t ready .
oh god , you idiot .
