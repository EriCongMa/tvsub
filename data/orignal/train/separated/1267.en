Got something for me?
Right here.
Everything cool?
Yeah.
Hey, there.
You got a second?
Tell me!
It's just detail it?
The only time I wash my car is right before I sell it.
It only has to be detailed again
Because you spilled your triple power latte,
and it smells like a deco.
What's deco?
A decomposing body.
How do you know it was me?
You know, Europeans have it right.
Car engineers design them without cup holders.
Where do you put your coffee?
You drink it at a cafe.
You do not slosh it around in your car.
I don't slosh, and where are you going?
to a rave with your friends Atticus and Tallulah?
No, feels more like cafe ace with London rockers.
Can you two go inspect someone else?
That's very yellow.
Thank you.
You know, you should be very careful
around ovulating women.
The university of texas study
determined that ovulating women are attracted to biker types
in order to fertilize their eggs.
Ha! Explains what happened
with, uh, me and your father.
Whoa, pop rode a motorcycle?
I'd rather not remember.
I thought if I looked the part,
I might get a u.c. assignment faster.
Did you hear we have a new boss at DCU?
You ever meet him, Jane? Lieutenant --
Rafael Martinez.
It's been a long time, Rizzoli.
Rafi, when did you crawl out from under the covers?
Vinnie!
I don't think we ever met, sir.
So, you're the other rizzoli.
Yeah, yeah, I guess so, sir.
Okay, other rizzoli.
My office in 10.
Sure.
Did you two -- - Maura, not now.
Frankie.
Oh, I cannot get a break.
Frankie, come on!
What did you two do?
I have to get this.
Don't you?
Rizzoli.
Dr. Isles.
Jane!
Yeah, we'll be right there.
Jane!
Bye, ma.
Well, thanks to you, I don't have
a change of clothes in my car --
It's getting -- detailed.
How many times do you want me to apologize?
Here. You can borrow these.
Fine.
Ruin your $200 zambonis.
Zanottis.
These are giuseppe zanottis. They're $550.
550 bucks!
I hope they gave you the rest of the cow.
You know, for that, they should give you the whole herd.
Mother...Phooey.
Morning, sergeant.
Morning.
So, Martinez is back, huh?
It'll be fine.
Oh, no, it's wicking.
Oh, no.
What's wicking?
It's being absorbed into the leather.
Well, that wouldn't have happened
If you were wearing these.
We got a good, old jurisdictional turf war
with the staties.
Tide is going out.
Body'll be on the sand in 15 minutes.
We'll have to work this case with the state police.
That is bullshit.
Why do they get jurisdiction over the beaches?
All right, we got to get her
to float back into bpd territory.
We can't move the body now, Jane.
Hey, Rizzoli!
Since we got this,
you mind grabbing us some coffee?
Oh, yeah, sure, right after I solve this homicide, okay?
I can't stand Bob Thatcher.
Yeah, officious and competitive.
Want to help me twist off his balding head?
Can we make it look like a suicide?
I never liked him, either.
The body is almost on the beach.
I guess I'm gonna be working this with the state police.
Oh, my gosh, look, Maura!
There's a -- there's a horseshoe crab!
Right there!
Where?
Right there!
Yeah, yeah, I see one right there.
There haven't been any horseshoe crabs
in dorchester bay in 25 years.
They're back.
Oh, look, there's another one right there!
Now, be careful. They're endangered.
What? Where?
I haven't seen one since I was a little kid.
Dr. Isles, I -- I think I see an egg.
okay!
You are in a delicate mating area
of the limulus polyphemus!
Okay, I need crime-scene tape and barricades now!
Hurry!
Oh, look at that! She's in the surf!
Guess this one's ours!
Oh, that's cute, Rizzoli!
That's real cute!
Listen, since you're not doing anything,
Can you grab me a triple power latte?!
Thank you!
Korsak.
She's so young.
We didn't find any I.D. on her.
We also didn't find any horseshoe crabs.
I'm sorry. It was all I could think of.
It's pretty symmetrical gashes.
I mean, these aren't from banging into pilings.
Look at this.
It takes a lot of force
to pull hair from the scalp right there.
Somebody slammed her head into something.
You think that's what killed her?
Well, froth in the nose and mouth
indicates drowning,
but I'll need to do a full autopsy.
You're gonna have a hell of a time
pulling prints off of her.
Early stage maceration.
A saline injection should restore fingerpads.
How long was she in the water?
Floaters are a unique challenge.
The ocean is a very effective medium
for destroying forensics.
How did I know you'd say that?
I'll give you a window.
She was in the water for 8 to 10 hours.
Given the tidal flow and the current,
She was dumped from somewhere inside the harbor.
Saw that from the crow's nest, did you, sailor?
I'm not even gonna dignify that
with an answer, gym rat.
I know that because she's not halfway to bermuda.
Inside the harbor? That's still a big area to cover.
We got to find the crime scene
where this poor girl was killed.
You're still wearing my boots.
You know I want 'em back.
Now?
They're so comfortable.
Okay, fine. You can keep 'em.
Really?
Yes.
As long as you promise to wear them
with all your yellow outfits.
I will change out of them as soon as I get a minute.
Maura,
What is this abrasion?
It's sticky.
What is Martinez doing down here?
Uh, well, DCU's evidence
is getting processed in-house now.
What happened with him?
Can we talk about this when he's not ten feet away?
Dr. Isles.
I should have introduced myself.
Rafael Martinez.
It's a little overwhelming coming back here
after being gone for so long.
Gone?
So, you're returning to BPD?
And here I thought Detective Rizzoli
had told you all about me.
It didn't even occur to me.
It's very nice of you to introduce yourself.
If you need anything,
feel free to contact me or my staff.
Thank you.
I finally get promoted to detective,
and my boss hates Rizzolis.
Hey, thanks, Jane.
Well, maybe it's not Rizzolis he hates
Maybe it's police work.
No, it's Rizzolis.
You slept with Rafael.
We didn't sleep, Maura.
Oh, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Rafael is very attractive.
You're very attractive.
Rafael wasn't your boss, was he?
Can you please stop calling him Rafael?
And, no, he wasn't.
Rafael is his name.
In a harlequin romance.
At work, here, it's Martinez.
Okay, so, other than in the biblical sense,
how do you know Lieutenant Martinez?
We worked together when I started in the drug unit.
We had to play a couple and go to clubs
and dance and blend in and drink and bust people.
I was hoping I'd never see him again.
Oh, no.
Jane, was he married?
No.
Actually, that would have been easier.
We got my C.I. Killed.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, and then we had a falling out,
and then he took an assignment
with a Federal Task Force,
and that was eight years ago,
and I haven't seen him since.
Dr. Isles?
Your sister's upstairs.
My sister?
That's what she said.
You do have a sister, Maura.
Oh, right.
Yes, tell Cailin to wait for me in the caf√©.
You know, you're a little harlequin romance-y yourself.
What do you mean?
Well, in the space of two years,
you found out your biological dad is a gangster
who's about to star in his own R.I.C.O. Trial,
and mom, a renowned humanitarian,
who is nice to everyone but you.
What else? Let's see. Am I forgetting something?
I gave my kidney to a half-sister I don't know.
I think I'm more of a Dickensian character.
Yeah, or a really good guest on "Jerry Springer."
Come on.
Where am I going?
To offer moral support
in case cailin wants another one of my organs.
No, thanks.
Unless...
Unless what?
Love your wellies.
You drive a hard bargain.
Cailin.
What a surprise.
You shouldn't bite your nails.
It's very unsanitary and bad for your teeth.
You'll have to excuse her.
Believe it or not, you make your big sister nervous.
Me? Why?
Well, she wants you to like her.
25% of all young adults bite their nails.
You'll grow out of it.
See? It's nerves.
Sorry. Sorry.
No, I'm -- I'm sorry to just show up here.
Would you like to talk to Maura alone?
No. I'm glad you're here.
It's about my mom.
Our mom.
You want to sit down?
Yeah.
Is she all right?
I'm not sure.
Some men came by the house last night.
What kind of men?
Scary ones.
I mean, they wore suits,
but they had this, like, dark energy.
Well, do you know what they wanted?
No, but they seemed pissed.
She told me to go to my room and lock my door.
Lock your door?
They were talking pretty quietly,
But I heard them ask her about M.E.N.D.
Medical emergency network of doctors.
That's Hope's charity.
Well, could it have been about fundraising?
It sounded like they were threatening her.
She says we're going back to london.
Well, isn't that a good idea? I thought you missed london.
I love it here now.
But...I don't know.
It's too full of ghosts for her.
I -- I don't mean you.
You mean Paddy Doyle?
Yeah, I see her reading the papers.
She's following his R.I.C.O. Pre-trial hearings.
I'm glad you're wearing it.
It's very sweet of you to give it to me.
I got to get back to class.
I'd really appreciate it if you'd talk to her,
find out what's going on.
Okay.
Now what?
No idea.
I can't think in these boots.
Come on, let me do it.
No.
Let me at least run the search.
No way!
Nothing in AFIC or NCIC.
Who the hell is she?
You got to go to the seminar
and read the manual.
It's not your personal toy.
And it's not an arcade game.
Move. I want to run the training session.
Stop!
Stop messing around. I'm not gonna break it.
Stop it! You're gonna break it.
Could you kids please share your toys?
Well, he hogs the thing like he owns it.
Yeah, because one swipe from bear paws here
will take out the whole system.
So, no I.D.? She's still a Jane Doe?
We got to wait on dental records.
Preliminary results are back
on the tissue samples from her lungs.
Lungs?
Wasn't cause of death drowning?
Yes, but not from seawater.
Sparkling water?
No, she aspirated rainwater.
We're looking for a crime scene
with a bucket full of rainwater?
Well, we know the body
was tossed in the ocean somewhere near the harbor.
Yeah, maybe she was killed near the harbor, too.
Are there any tests you can run?
I'll have Susie run the water from the lungs through the mass spectrometer.
It is a long shot, though.
Hey, what are you doing for lunch?
Nothing. Why?
Come on, Maura. You can do this. Come on.
No, I don't like to be tricked twice in one day.
I said we were having lunch. I didn't say where.
Oh, it was wise of you not to tell me what lunch was, either.
What, you don't like cold, greasy corn dogs?
You know, this used to be a methadone clinic,
but thanks to dr. Hope martin,
It's the first M.E.N.D. Clinic in the U.S.
Look, I do not object to her saving women and children,
but I do object to her calling me a liar
and then ignoring me until she needed my kidney.
You're a good person.
Why do we always feel this tug
when we're related by blood?
What does the research say?
Nothing that explains how I feel.
Name?
Detective Rizzoli!
Hi, Shandra.
Girl, you are still as skinny
as the day you locked me up.
How are you? You look great.
Thank you. This woman is the reason I quit drugs
And finished nursing school.
Look at you.
Thank you.
Sorry it's so crazy in here today.
No, that's all right.
We're actually here to see dr. Martin.
Bye-bye.
Maura.
Detective rizzoli.
Is Cailin all right?
Yeah, she's fine.
She's a little concerned about you, though.
About me? Why?
Where did you get that necklace?
Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.
I-I thought you knew that Cailin gave it to me.
Oh, of course.
Shandra, could you please
put Mrs. Reynolds in room two
and weigh that Perez baby? Thanks.
Let's go talk in my office.
Teenagers can be so dramatic.
Those "Big, scary men --" They're my accountants.
Well, I'll talk to her.
Your accountants come at 11:00 at night?
Well, I am too busy during the day.
She's afraid for you, Hope.
And that's silly.
And although I'm very sorry that she put you through this,
I really am glad to see you, Maura.
I don't want to pry into your life.
I just feel a responsibility to Cailin.
I told her I would talk to you.
And I so appreciate it, but, really,
It's just M.E.N.D. business.
Is that why you told Cailin to lock the door?
And why are you moving back to London?
Is someone threatening you, Hope?
Sorry, doctor.
We're getting a little behind.
I will be right there.
I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.
How can you go back to london
with all these people depending on you?
Every clinic that I open
has to run without me eventually.
And I do have to think about Cailin.
She wants to move back to London.
Thank you.
Too bad lying give her hives.
Maybe she has a reason, Jane.
What -- the truth gives her eczema?
You don't like her, do you?
No, I don't like the way she treats you.
Cailin's an adult. Have a relationship with her.
You know, you don't have to have contact with Hope.
And, by the way,
What does constance say about all this?
She raised me. She's my mother.
I don't talk about it with her.
Hey, Frost. What's up?
Got something, although bear paws
might take the rest of his life pulling it up.
You know, some research indicates
that a wide hand with stubby fingers
correlates with high intelligence.
See that, smart ass?
Got our victim.
Brenda Thomas, 20.
She was a BCU student.
And a psi beta tau.
Same type as in my day.
Betas were smart, foxy.
You didn't go to college, Korsak.
I went to a lot of toga parties.
I wouldn't use that.
Expired lipstick grows bacteria.
Is it pinkish red in a black tube?
Yes.
She's had that since I got promoted.
Ignore him, Jane.
Victim's parents live in Dedham.
We'll make the notification, then hit the sorority house.
All right, I'll meet you back at bpd.
What's wrong?
I forgot to get my dry cleaning,
So I'm gonna drop you off and pick it up.
Okay.
You said this was about my daughter, so get to it.
Call your boys off Maura.
What the hell you talking about?
The thugs you got following Maura.
Call them off, Paddy.
Is she okay? Is Maura all right?
Yeah, she's fine.
Why are your guys following her?
Are these the same guys that you sicced on Hope?
Did you get a look at 'em?
They're not your guys, are they?
I don't think you need me
to answer that one for you, Rizzoli.
Why are the feds after Hope?
Why are they surveilling Maura?
I'm done here.
No, wait a minute!
Why are they surveilling Maura?
Thanks, Gabriel. I really appreciate it.
That was awkward.
Thank you for calling agent Dean.
I know that was hard.
What did he say?
He said he really shouldn't be talking to me,
but here's what he knows.
The organized crime division of the FBI
is investigating M.E.N.D. and Hope.
Oh, my god. For what?
He said he didn't know.
But think about it, Maura.
It's got to be connected to Paddy.
And you should have seen Paddy's face.
He knows why.
Okay. She started M.E.N.D. In 1993.
That's 20 years ago.
Which means they were in contact after I was born.
Maybe even when he was a fugitive.
They're following you, too.
The feds?
Yeah, I saw them today.
Why?
I don't have anything to do with M.E.N.D. or with Paddy.
What do I do?
Nothing.
I mean, there's nothing you can do once they're surveilling you.
All right, I got to go talk to the victim's roommates.
Go.
Go, it's okay.
You seeing anything?
Just a bunch of girly stuff.
I think I just found some study aids.
"BCU Gold Dust."
Looks like cocaine.
Jane's stuck on Memorial Drive.
We have to get DCU involved.
What's the deal between Jane and Martinez?
It is a long story.
Rachel?
Come in here, please, would you?
Did Brenda snort a lot of cocaine?
No way.
She was so against drugs.
She didn't even drink.
She told me that her brother died from an O.D.
Help your friend out, Rachel.
We need to know what Brenda was into.
School.
How about the rest of you? You recognize this?
I don't know why she had that, but she was not using it.
Did she have a boyfriend?
No.
She studied so much, she'd fall asleep in the library.
That's why we weren't worried when she didn't come home.
What was she studying?
Brenda wanted to be an investigative journalist.
Like Woodward and Bernstein?
No, like Christiane Amanpour.
She got an "A" on this investigative report.
Yeah, she got an "A" on everything.
Who is T.F.?
Her adviser, Tyrell Feeney.
Brenda called him "Touchy Feeney."
Maybe Touchy Feeney did more than just touch.
Looks like Brenda didn't want her sorority sisters in her computer.
She password-protected everything and stored it in the cloud.
There's no way I'll get in without a password.
Did you try "password"?
"Password"?
Yeah. It's the most common password.
What do we know about Mr. Touchy Feeney?
Well, he was a part-time adjunct professor at BCU,
wrote about crime for the Boston Dispatch.
Okay, this is interesting.
He owns a boat.
Does he?
I wonder if he took Brenda for a ride.
Nice boat.
We found it when we were doing a little digging
into a dead girl's relationships.
Brenda and I didn't have a relationship.
She was an exceptional student. That's all.
How so?
She was truly gifted.
She could write, and she could get anybody to talk to her.
When she thought she had a story, you couldn't shake her loose.
What was she working on?
I had all my students working on investigative pieces
for the Boston Dispatch College Contest.
What was she investigating?
I don't know.
You were her adviser.
I made an exception.
Maybe I shouldn't have,
but, like any good journalist,
Brenda was protecting her sources.
Well, maybe she just didn't want any contact with you, Tyrell.
You are a hugger.
That was me just being friendly and encouraging.
You hug all your students?
She was 21.
Even if I did hug her, which I didn't,
it isn't a crime.
Not unless you killed her.
I did not kill her.
Where were you last night?
Out with my wife.
She can verify that.
Next time you guys would like to talk to me, call my lawyer.
Frankie.
Oh, come on, Frankie.
What?
You look terrible.
Thanks.
What can I do?
Fix it.
Whatever happened between you and Martinez, undo it.
Well, you know what, Frankie?
It's not that easy, all right?
I'll just suck it up while Martinez shuts me out of any real drug work.
DCU's working my homicide, okay?
I'll get you on it.
Oh, fun!
Maybe you'll let me answer your phones.
You know what, Frankie?
Other Rizzoli.
Been looking for you. Come on.
Wait, Frankie, come...
You and Martinez should've worked this out eight years ago.
Vince, come on. This is my business, all right?
But we're all caught up in the middle of it, Jane.
Clean it up.
Oh, good, Jane.
I've got something.
I may be able to narrow down the location of the crime scene.
That's great news. How?
Well, the water in Brenda's lungs showed low levels of salinity
plus CO2 as bicarbonate anion, fish scales, and rust.
What kind of rust?
Heavy-gauge tin.
Saline, fish scales, and rusty tin.
That all says one of the old warehouses near the harbor to me.
Yeah, me, too.
What's bicarbonated anion?
Rainwater.
Hey, Frost, can you check the seaport district?
See how many abandoned warehouses are down there?
You don't know how to use that.
Oh, yeah? I read the whole manual.
There are only seven processing plants still standing.
Let's go check 'em out.
This is number 4.
Well, look at that.
Looks like we found our bucket of rainwater.
Water from the roof is leaking right into it.
I'll compare the water in here to the water from her lungs.
That's blood, and that's hair.
Get CSRU here, have 'em process everything.
The water is a match.
Okay, this is our crime scene.
Found a wireless mike.
It's greasy.
Looks like someone crushed it with his heel.
Maybe she was wearing a microphone.
That explains the adhesive we found.
She had a mike taped to her chest.
These mikes are pretty cheap,
but they give a near-broadcast-quality recording.
Near-broadcast quality.
She wanted to be like Christiane Amanpour.
Maybe she was wired for an ambush interview.
Well, that'll get you killed.
Yeah, especially when you're writing about drugs.
Think about it. She didn't do drugs.
She was writing an investigative piece.
What about those bindles we found?
She had 'em arranged like evidence.
Maybe she was cataloging them for the story?
I've tried getting into her cloud.
We need her password.
I'm telling you, try "Password."
Try "Bcu Gold."
We're in!
Crap. Almost.
The audio files are individually password protected.
Try "Password."
If you say that again,
I don't care how big your bear paws are...
trying "Bcu gold."
No.
Yes!
This one's opening.
Please!
Please!
Don't!
Hey, Korsak, you ever wish you went to college?
Yeah, sometimes.
You?
I saved my acceptance letter
to Boston Cambridge University.
I don't know why.
I do.
It's damned impressive that you got in,
and unbelievably selfless that you chose not to go.
I'm the daughter of a plumber.
My parents would still be paying it off.
What is it?
There's something in here.
ÊãâÊñêÂ∞î¬∑È©¨‰∏ÅÂÜÖÊñØË≠¶Áù£
Looks like you got another C.I. killed.
What the hell are you talking about?
Brenda Thomas. You recognize her?
'cause we pulled her body out of the harbor.
You knew.
Cavanaugh told me after they found
the cocaine in Brenda's room.
We got brought in to investigate, yes.
Well, you seem pretty calm
for someone who just lost a C.I.
She wasn't my C.I.
No?
Then why does she have your card and your safety word?
Because all your informants are expendable, right?
Just one more dead one.
One more dead one like Yolanda.
Brenda asked for an interview
for a story about campus drugs.
I talked to her because she told me
she could get me into a big operation.
We've been trying to bust the guy
supplying to all the colleges in boston.
With Bcu Gold?
With a lot of cocaine, yes.
So, you send this little college kid
to do an undercover drug buy?
One time, Rizzoli!
Do you know another way to bust drug dealers?
You use C.I.s.
Nobody likes it, but that's how it is.
Well, why didn't you tell me about all this?
I thought we were working together.
Are we?
I want to know everything you know about the supplier.
I got nothing.
Well, you better get something
because this naive kid,
who didn't want anybody O.D.ing, like her brother,
was drowned in a fish trough.
And that's on you, Martinez.
We already picked up the guy
from the buy Brenda made for us.
We're trying to get him to make an introduction
to one of my undercovers.
One of your under--
Who, Frankie?
Do me a favor.
Don't get my brother killed.
What the hell happened to the dirty robber?
New owners committed to locally sourced organic food.
Yeah, well, I'm committed
to finding a burger and fries.
Oh, no, come on.
Just try it.
Come on.
There's a table right there.
Anything?
Frost can't get into the rest of Brenda's files.
What about you? You thinking about hope?
Jane, are they here?
Who?
The feds.
Yes. You see that guy right there
with the nose ring and a bolt through his ear?
That's their lead agent.
Yeah. No, maura.
No?
No.
What -- now, why are you eating their plants?
Fresh lavender. Try it.
Smells like hand lotion.
Well, they do have burgers.
This sounds good, this scrambled tofu patty.
Yummy.
Get it with a side of mung bean fries.
I can't stop thinking about Brenda.
Me, neither.
We didn't get her killed, Maura. I did.
You're not talking about Brenda, are you?
I guess that's why I've been so mad at Martinez.
Are you sure you're okay?
Um, yeah.
We're gonna be right here listening the whole time.
You have any problems, just say the word "Cricket."
Yeah, we use the word cricket
so you won't slip up and make a mistake, all right?
You only use it if you're in trouble.
Okay.
I just so desperately wanted my own C.I.,
and I leaned on this sweet, screwed-up girl
Named Yolanda.
You good to go?
Let's do it.
She wasn't ready, but I offered her up, anyway.
What are you doing?
I told you I'd be here.
You have it with you? I have the money.
Who's with you?
Nobody's with me. I'm alone.
She's in trouble.
Wait for the safety word.
No, don't!
You wired?
Cricket! Cricket!
We got to go!
BPD!
Oh, no, no. Come on.
Come on, baby. Yolanda, it's me.
Yolanda?
What is it?
Frost got into
the other three files in Brenda's cloud.
She taped three buys with student drug dealers„ÄÇ
Here's the last one.
Recorded the afternoon she died.
I really need something to get me through finals.
I got you covered.
You're a sweetheart.
You could sell so much Bcu Gold to my sisters
if you'd just come to the house.
I already told you, it's too risky.
I heard someone got arrested there.
So? Introduce me to your connection.
I'll do it, cut you in for 40%.
I don't know.
Come on, it'll be easy.
Well, she got that introduction,
and whoever's running this thing killed her,
So how do we find that student?
I'll get on it first thing tomorrow.
What? What is it?
Cailin.
The feds just left Hope's house.
I've got to show you something.
Just when I thought I'd seen everything.
I figured out how to do it when I was 9.
My parents didn't want me watching TV,
so they locked it up.
It's over here.
Ooh, Maura, you've been down here before.
God, this is so unlike you.
Maybe not. I am the spawn of a mobster, after all.
Well, is that why you come down here?
When paddy got arrested,
I started poking through all these files.
They go all the way back to his father.
Your grandfather.
yes.
Maura, come on. You're not like him.
You're not like any of 'em.
Well, something in these files is gonna tell us
why the feds were looking at me and at hope.
1993 -- that's the year Paddy became a fugitive.
There's not a lot here while he was on the run.
I bet the fbi has a ton.
Look.
She came back once a year on my birthday.
Well, that's touching.
Maura, she thought you were dead.
Okay, what if she wasn't coming for me?
What do you mean?
I have a hunch.
Oh, no, here we go.
Maura, I told you never to hunch.
You're not made for hunching.
Okay.
Cailin told me that Paddy
gave this to Hope on her 18th birthday.
That would have been 1976.
That's not possible
because this scrimshaw
commemorates something that was built in 1993.
The year paddy disappeared?
Yes.
And the year that hope was working as a relief doctor
in a war-torn area, sarajevo.
So, I did some research, and I looked up
photos on the internet of this bridge.
And it was near a secret tunnel that was built
during the siege of sarajevo
by people trying to get humanitarian aid into the city.
Humanitarian aid?
You think your mother helped build it?
They named it the tunnel of Hope.
Oh, my god.
Paddy was a fugitive in 1993.
He could have easily traveled to the balkans.
So, you think Paddy and Hope met in Sarajevo?
It's worse.
Hope started M.E.N.D.
thanks to a $2.5 million donation
from an anonymous donor...
In 1993, Jane.
Oh, my god.
That's why the feds are sniffing around.
She took his dirty money.
Why am I here?
Take a look at that.
They're the financial statements from M.E.N.D.
And why are you looking at them?
I don't think we're the only ones looking.
I don't know what you mean.
Who gave you the money to start M.E.N.D.?
I don't know,
But I will be forever grateful to him or her.
Because, thanks to that money,
we've been able to save thousands of women and children.
I need to know.
Was it paddy?
I have sick patients that I need to see.
You won't be able to help them
If you're named as a co-conspirator.
Is that why the feds are putting pressure on you?
Were you laundering money for him?
I can't -- - can't what?
I can't involve you.
I am involved.
They're following me, too.
What?
Oh, god, Maura. No.
I need to see him, and I need to talk to him.
I need to make this stop.
Maura.
Don't talk to me.
Talk to her.
You told me she was dead.
You told me that our baby...
was dead.
I had to -- to protect you.
Why?
My father would have killed you both.
You have another chance to protect them, paddy.
How's that?
You're going to plead guilty.
You know I'd kill for either of you.
But I will never plead guilty.
Mother ...Phooey.
Did anything csru processed from the crime scene
yield any prints or dna?
I'm sorry, nothing.
Oh, wait. There was one thing, though.
The residue on the wireless mike
is transmission fluid with 41-40 steel particulates.
That's a transmission grinding itself up.
Jane, I think these are metal particulates,
And I am almost certain that what I stepped in
was transmission fluid.
From the parking lot of the first crime scene?
Yes.
Susie, run both sets of metal particulate through the sem-edx
And analyze the fluids from the shoe and the microphone
using the hplc.
So, you're saying the transmission fluid
on the microphone we found in the processing plant
is the same as the stuff you stepped in
When we found her body?
Yes.
Csru usually takes photos
to establish the location of the crime scene.
Yeah, Frost, are there any photos from the parking lot?
Mm-hmm. Right here.
So, it's one of these cars?
Wait a minute -- we can't know our killer left that fluid
on the day we fished her body out of the drink.
Yeah, we can.
I can even tell you which car was leaking.
Oh, that multi-touch interface
is talking to you, Tom Cruise?
It's right here
In the vehicle maintenance records.
For the state police.
Our killer's a state trooper.
Martinez.
Hey, Vinnie, what's up?
We're on our way to arrest Brenda's killer.
Yeah, you can come with us, if you want.
Yeah. I'd like that.
Where to?
We tracked the suspect on the gps in his unmarked.
It's a cop?
Yeah, it's a state trooper.
Looks like it was the college supplier
Brenda was telling you about.
Where is he?
Bcu campus -- probably there
to collect his last payments before he splits.
You got plates?
Yeah.
No, no, I don't want campus police pulling him over.
I'm not calling campus police.
I'm calling someone to make sure he doesn't get away.
Can you move that?
Oh, I can't seem to get it to turn over.
All right, I'll help you push it out of the way.
I'm in a hurry.
Frankie, get out of the way!
Thatcher, it's all over!
No, you don't! No, you don't!
You stay together or I will blow his head off!
Don't do it.
Anything happens to my brother,
I won't need this gun to kill you.
This is as much on you as it is on me.
Looks like you got nowhere to go, dude.
All right, you drop the bike, and you get in my car.
Lift it up! Get it up!
You're under arrest, Thatcher.
My brother's good, huh?
Yeah.
All right, just relax.
Almost as good as you.
Don't even.
what?
