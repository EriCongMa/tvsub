mr. shioma wants what you owe him ...
and he wants it soon .
by me .
this doesn &apos;t change anything .
i &apos;d like to report two murders .
you can find the bodies in the makua kea &apos;au forest reserve .
how do you know this ?
because i put them there .
24 months ? goro &apos;s men kidnapped him and tried to kill him .
it was self @-@ defense .
to them , it &apos;s an opportunity to lock up the son
of a yakuza boss on a double homicide .
yeah , self @-@ defense or not , they can still charge you
with criminal possession of a weapon .
adam doesn &apos;t even seem interested in fighting this .
he &apos;s thinking of taking the deal .
if you needed another reason
to hate reigning welterweight champion of the world , devon haynes ,
try getting around downtown honolulu this evening .
lane closures for tonight &apos;s weigh @-@ in
at the blaisdell arena
have traffic at a standstill in some places .
the time is here , baby !
champ ...
a hawaiian @-@ born fighter
has never won a world title
in that popular welterweight division .
luke nakano says
he can take your belt and make boxing history
here in hawaii tomorrow night .
what do you say ?
see , back in the day ,
missionaries sailed these islands on whaling ships
to spread peace and religion .
but i &apos;m here on a different mission .
i &apos;m here to bring a little pain ...
a little suffering .
ah , your boy talks a good game , huh ?
yeah , well , he can back it up--
23 and 0 , 18 knockouts .
guy &apos;s an animal .
yo , bobby flay ,
these burgers need a little bit more grill time .
what have i told you
about backseat barbecuing at my house ?
luke ! luke !
here comes my boy .
luke ! luke ! luke ! luke ! luke !
luke ! luke ! luke ! luke !
all right .
look at this , wow , mahalo .
how you doing ?
champion of the world !
luke , good evening .
a lot of the experts predicting
a quick knockout tomorrow night .
they &apos;re giving me way too much credit .
you see , i think haynes can go the distance .
thanks a lot , luke .
how &apos;s kono holding up ?
oh , she &apos;s hanging in there . she &apos;s trying not to worry
until they see what comes out of the hearing .
last offer i heard was 24 months-- is that right ?
yeah , and the prosecutor &apos;s holding firm on that .
i think adam &apos;s family ties to organized crime ,
along with the suspicion surrounding his brother &apos;s murder ,
hurt his chances of avoiding jail time altogether .
yeah , i agree .
sorry i &apos;m late . i forgot the candles .
hey , max .
max . i wasn &apos;t aware you were jewish .
oh , well , as one might imagine , i get that often .
i was adopted by a jewish family .
oh , cool .
potato latke .
shallow @-@ fried in peanut oil .
lightly salted .
your ancestors would be proud of you , bruddah .
so , how does this work , brah ?
the eight candles represent the eight days of hanukkah .
that is correct , mr. ortega .
bruddah ...
you &apos;re supposed to be in a house of worship
for that kind of stuff .
well , the lighting of the menorah is meant to be done
in front of many people
to celebrate the miracle that the holiday represents .
maybe you should light one of them candles for my boy , luke .
he &apos;s gonna need a miracle tomorrow night .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s those kind of candles , flippa .
actually , this holiday &apos;s about celebrating the ...
the triumph of faith and courage over might , so ...
it might be a little help .
the lord works in mysterious ways , huh ?
well , that &apos;s technically a different deity ,
but your sentiment is correct , captain grover .
shalom .
shalom , shalom .
shalom .
not for you .
sorry .
here we are with local hero luke nakano ,
standing face @-@ to @-@ face with reigning champion
and bad boy of the boxing world , devon haynes .
we are less than 24 hours away
from what many experts are calling a tune @-@ up fight for haynes
on his way to next year &apos;s mega fight
against the number one contender in the division ,
the undefeated manny garcia .
if luke is intimidated ,
he &apos;s doing a great job of hiding it
with that million @-@ dollar smile .
whoa , whoa , whoa , i got a good idea .
how about we get a picture of my man luke here
in one those little grass skirts .
you know what , kolohe ?
kolohe !
you talk a lot of stink .
hope you can back it up .
not now , ben . stop .
knock it off , benny .
it &apos;s not worth it .
you must be the big brother ex @-@ con junkie .
why don &apos;t you stop fronting in front of your mokes ,
come over here and let me teach you something about respect .
tell you what , tiny bubbles ...
how about you meet me in the parking lot
tomorrow night after the fight ?
after i &apos;m done wiping the canvas
with your baby brother .
you know what ? bring your whole tribe .
bring your mama , bring your sister ,
and i &apos;ll kick all y &apos;all loco moco @-@ eatin &apos; asses .
let him go , let him go , man ! let him go !
i got enough power level for everybody !
hey . how &apos;d it go ?
prosecutor &apos;s last and final offer was 18 months .
okay .
we accepted it .
it &apos;s the best our lawyers could do .
if i took it to trial and lost ,
i was looking at a minimum of five years .
when do you have to surrender ?
tomorrow morning .
it &apos;s just 18 months , okay ?
then we &apos;ll be able to start our lives together
without my past getting in the way .
i just can &apos;t believe this is happening to us .
now , you concentrate on taking care of yourself , all right ?
i &apos;ll take care of her .
okay .
yeah .
thanks , man .
it &apos;s a stupid conversation in the first place .
yeah , it is .
boxing is better than mma in all ways .
you &apos;re crazy .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m not crazy .
let me explain something to you , okay ?
boxing is civilized .
which is probably why you don &apos;t like it that much , okay ?
it &apos;s a technical sport .
it requires something that you do not have .
patience , all right ?
it &apos;s called the sweet science for a reason .
how about i give you some sweet math , all right ?
three minutes , 19 seconds , to be exact .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
what does that mean ?
oh , well , i &apos;ll tell you what it means .
three minutes , 19 seconds is the time that it took randy couture
to take out james toney in the octagon in 2010 .
okay ? james toney ? he @-@ he hit his peak in the &apos; 70s !
what are you talking about ? james toney .
lou , let me ask you a question .
it &apos;s a very , very serious question .
boxing or mma ?
boxing . no question .
thank you .
that &apos;s one opinion .
no , it &apos;s actually one , two opinions .
okay ? should we keep asking people ?
â€­ no , no . why don &apos;t you shut up ,
we &apos;ll let him speak , how about that ?
you should get your money back from that therapist .
our vic &apos;s name is ben nakano . it &apos;s luke &apos;s brother .
wait a minute , last time we saw him , he
was throwing punches at the champ on live tv .
that &apos;s right .
well , nobody ever accused that kid of being a genius .
matter of fact , he was a pretty good boxer himself
before he got mixed up with drugs a couple of years ago .
he &apos;s been in and out of jail ever since .
but nine months ago , he got paroled .
he &apos;s working with his brother .
he &apos;s been on the straight and narrow .
this surf pro up here
was coming back here to get a few boards for a lesson ,
and he found him like this .
what &apos;s up , max ?
gentlemen . c.o.d. appears to be blunt force trauma .
and estimated t.o.d. is about 10 : 00 p.m. last night .
looks like a body dump .
that is correct , detective williams .
lividity pattern on the body suggests that
he was transported here at least a few hours after the murder .
that &apos;s his wallet and keys .
well , clearly , this wasn &apos;t a robbery .
tuned him up pretty good
this , uh , looks like it was maybe personal .
maybe some leftover hard feelings from the weigh @-@ in ?
haynes said he was here to spread some pain and suffering , right ?
maybe he got started early .
watch me slip the jab . slip .
back .
and double jab . pop , pop . right uppercut , left hook .
looking good , kid !
one , two .
one , two . pop , pop .
hold on , champ .
yo , man , i thought i told you no reporters , man .
get those vultures out of here .
those aren &apos;t reporters . that &apos;s five @-@ 0 , buddy .
hey , guys .
hey . listen , uh , we need a word with your fighter .
it &apos;s about ben , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , it is .
i warned you .
yeah , what &apos;d he get arrested for now ?
he didn &apos;t get arrested .
benny was luke &apos;s trainer
all through his amateur career .
then he found something that he liked more than boxing--
cocaine .
my brother had his share of problems ,
but he wasn &apos;t a bad guy .
i wouldn &apos;t be where i am without him .
i was just starting to trust him again , you know ?
he was in my corner ,
helping buddy out .
what happened when the cameras were turned off at the weigh @-@ in ?
after everyone cleared out ,
i laid into ben for letting haynes rile him up .
he was pretty pissed off when he left .
i said some things i shouldn &apos;t have said .
luke , i got to ask you a question .
do you know where ben might have gone after he left the arena ?
no . he was supposed to be in here in the morning
at the gym with us , you know ? but ...
when he didn &apos;t show , i just figured he was still mad .
yeah , all right , listen , uh ,
we &apos;re very , very sorry for your loss .
we &apos;ll leave you to it , all right ? take care , kid .
see you , nick .
benny , nicky .
luke .
you &apos;re not fighting tonight .
not after this .
i &apos;m gonna cancel it .
no . no , you &apos;re not .
unless he &apos;s in handcuffs ,
i &apos;m getting in that ring with him .
think about this .
that &apos;s all i &apos;ve been doing the last few months .
this is my shot , nicky .
it may never come along again .
this is what i &apos;ve been working my whole life for .
all right , my brother had his faults ,
but i loved him more than anyone on this earth .
we talked about bringing home that belt .
he wanted this for me .
you know what he said ?
he said the only person that could stop me is myself .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
he wouldn &apos;t want me to .
hello .
it &apos;s good to be king , man .
yeah .
gentlemen , if you &apos;re here to talk to me
about that bad boy nonsense that happened at the weigh @-@ in ...
talk to my manager .
yeah , actually , we &apos;re here to talk to you
about what happened afterwards .
ben nakano was murdered last night .
that &apos;s terrible .
what happened ?
i &apos;m gonna show you right now .
there .
hold on , wait , you don &apos;t think
i had anything to do with that , do you ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , you know , after what we saw on tv ,
it doesn &apos;t look like the two of you &apos;ll be
exchanging christmas gifts , you know ?
all that stuff ?
that &apos;s just business .
the bling , the arrogance , the bad boy nonsense ?
i mean , it &apos;s just a show . it &apos;s what sells .
people like a villain .
i play a good villain .
i mean , pay @-@ per @-@ view sales went up 18 %
the first half hour after the weigh @-@ in .
okay , so you &apos;re saying there was no hard feelings afterwards ?
i &apos;m not saying that .
but when we left that arena , any feelings that i had--
they stayed there .
okay .
what about , uh , the rest of your folks ?
can you account for them ?
you &apos;re wasting your time .
look , nobody on my team would let
some thin @-@ skinned ex @-@ con or his wide @-@ eyed little brother
get in the way of a $ 50 million payout
against manny garcia next year .
we &apos;re way too smart for that .
you &apos;re acting like the kid doesn &apos;t stand a chance .
he doesn &apos;t .
that isn &apos;t a act .
it &apos;s a fact .
oh , lieutenant kelly , inspector dunn .
chag sameach , max .
oh , happy holidays to you as well .
so what do you have for us ?
well , thanks to the magic of infrared photography ,
i discovered some subdermal bruising
on the victim &apos;s wrists and biceps ,
inflicted around the time of death ,
which would be consistent with the fact that
he was restrained while being assaulted .
so we &apos;re talking multiple attackers ?
it appears so .
both the orbital bones are completely shattered .
yes , the damage is quite profound .
however , it &apos;s the small fracture on the back of the skull
that yielded the most interesting clue .
i found these shards
embedded in a laceration on the scalp .
so someone smashed him in the back of the head with a bottle .
bright orange-- that &apos;s a pretty distinctive color .
it is .
i rushed the samples to the lab ,
and they were able to detect trace elements on the shards
that made up of ingredients to the pala &apos;ai ale ,
a local and seasonal pumpkin microbrew .
its unique selling point is the bright orange bottle .
crime lab says it &apos;s not sold in stores at this time ,
however there was a limited distribution to a few taverns .
one is right here in this town .
a place called the coral point .
i know that place .
it &apos;s only a couple blocks from where they found his body .
i knew him pretty well .
he &apos;s a regular here .
and he &apos;s not the criminal he looks like in that picture .
he was actually a really sweet guy .
that &apos;s him right there with his brother .
they grew up a few miles from here .
he was doing so well .
he was off the drugs .
said he was helping his brother train for the big fight .
so what happened ?
well , we were hoping you could tell us .
there were two guys with him last night .
one was a samoan ,
over six foot , 300 pounds .
did ben come in with them ?
no , he came in alone around 8 : 00 .
he was drinking for a while .
the two guys came later and joined him .
but they definitely knew each other ?
yeah , for sure .
ben seemed happy to see &apos; em .
the big guy bought a round
of shots for the whole place ,
like he was celebrating something .
and he paid with a $ 100 bill .
is there any chance it &apos;s still here ?
yeah , last night &apos;s take is in the safe .
we &apos;re gonna need that bill .
we may be able to pull some prints off of it .
okay .
do you know what time ben left ?
they all left together around 10 : 00 .
it was odd , though .
they said they were going out into the alley
to have a cigarette .
they left through that door and never came back .
looks like we &apos;ve found our primary crime scene .
this is definitely the same glass
that max found lodged in the victim &apos;s scalp .
i &apos;ll call csu .
so , ben &apos;s hanging out with two of his drinking buddies ,
one of whom is rolling in crisp $ 100 bills .
everything &apos;s hunky @-@ dory till they step outside for a smoke .
then the bromance sours ,
escalates , and they end up beating him to death .
yeah , if it was one assailant ,
i &apos;d buy that it was personal , but two ?
i &apos;m thinking it was business .
the law teaches the vanity of this body .
if i must bear all venom , pain and spite ,
i will advance in my practices with energetic spirit
until the end ,
and i will rue none of it .
you remember when i told you about my grandparents ?
how much i admired their love for one another ?
yeah ?
yeah .
well , what i didn &apos;t tell you
was how things started out between them .
the day after their wedding ,
my grandfather was drafted into the japanese navy
and spent the next three years on a ship
while my grandmother waited without any word from him .
and neither of them ever stopped believing
they would be together .
and you know the rest .
they were married for 60 years ,
had five children , plenty of grandchildren .
i want the same for us , kono .
you just have to believe .
i do .
good .
so csu finished processing
the $ 100 bill we recovered from the bar .
no usable prints or dna , but the serial number
came back to money stolen in an armored car heist two days ago .
three guys in ski masks hit a truck outside a supermarket .
got away with $ 150k in cash .
all right , so maybe
ben got tired of carrying his brother &apos;s water ,
found a way to make some more money .
yeah , except when it was time to split the cash ,
they decided he wasn &apos;t part of the equation .
csu was able to trace the print
on the bottle back to this guy .
juru katsu . he &apos;s a halawa graduate .
he was in there for extortion , robbery , assault .
the usual .
the bartender at the coral point bar said that
she i.d. &apos; d him as being there last night .
he was one of the guys who left with ben ,
but that &apos;s not the most interesting thing about him .
fbi database has him as a known associate
of our old and dear friend gabriel waincroft .
he and mr. waincroft were both indicted ,
along with 12 other people ,
on a rico case in 2005 .
but eventually the government &apos;s case fell apart
when the main witness was found murdered .
all right , well , it &apos;s no coincidence
that gabriel &apos;s name is popping up now .
i don &apos;t think so , either .
i think he &apos;s probably got his fingers
in that armored car heist .
$ 150,000 split four ways is @-@ is beneath gabriel waincroft .
no , i agree with danny .
this isn &apos;t about money .
gabriel &apos;s got lots of other plays .
i say we ask juru what those are .
so is this how you interpret &quot; immunity and means &quot; ?
no , no , no , no , no . that &apos;s steve , not me .
â€­ i don &apos;t do this kind of stuff .
i don &apos;t approve of it .
you know , he &apos;s very impatient when it comes to
getting information from people .
you know , two weeks after i met him ,
he hung a guy off of a building by his ankles .
this is actually ... this is mild in comparison .
don &apos;t you think ?
i guess .
i wouldn &apos;t , uh ... i wouldn &apos;t bring any
of these techniques back to san francisco with you .
yeah , i agree .
you say something ?
i &apos;ll talk ! i &apos;ll talk ! i &apos;ll tell you what you want to know !
gabriel had nothing to do with the armored car heist .
and neither did ben .
okay , so how do you know ben ?
we spent some time together in halawa .
gabriel found out about it and sent some guys to find me .
relax , juru .
no one &apos;s gonna hurt you .
i need a favor .
a very important favor .
he wanted me to find ben ,
offer him $ 50k for his security access pass to the fight tonight .
why ? what &apos;s he planning ?
when gabriel waincroft asks you to do something ,
you don &apos;t ask questions .
okay .
well , $ 50,000 for a vip pass--
it seems like a pretty good deal .
how does this guy end up dead ?
he wasn &apos;t down with it .
he was even a little insulted that i asked .
said he wouldn &apos;t let anyone do anything
that would jeopardize his brother &apos;s shot at a title .
all right , so what ? so you beat him to death ?
that ... that wasn &apos;t the plan .
gabriel gave me two choices .
pay him for the pass
or kill him for it .
coming back without it wasn &apos;t an option .
how do we find gabriel ?
if i knew where he was , i &apos;d tell you .
because the minute he finds out i &apos;m out here talking to you ,
i &apos;m a dead man .
all right , ben was killed
so gabriel could get special access to the fight
and bypass security without going through the magnetometers .
we don &apos;t know what they &apos;re bringing in .
it could be guns , it could be explosives .
well , whatever he &apos;s got planned , it &apos;s gonna be big .
this event is attracting major attention
from all over the world .
â€­ yeah . speaking of which , fight &apos;s about to start .
yeah , which means gabriel &apos;s probably already inside .
the first round of this scheduled
12 @-@ round championship fight has clearly gone to haynes .
and if luke nakano doesn &apos;t find a way to solve
the left jab of devon haynes , it &apos;s gonna be a quick
and painful night for the hometown hero .
he &apos;s looked completely overmatched since the opening bell .
haynes backs nakano up .
haynes with a devastating right ,
and it looks like it may have hurt nakano .
okay , i &apos;ve been in touch with arena security .
ben &apos;s pass was used ten minutes ago
to access an employee entrance .
all right , jerry , do we have a visual on who used it ?
yeah , three male subjects dressed in arena staff uniforms ,
carrying a large duffle bag .
looks like it &apos;s pretty heavy .
also got hits in facial rec .
all three of these guys are in the system .
sending the info now .
tomas rojas ,
jose delarosa and mica barello .
local and federal intel sources show them listed
as soldiers in the culiacan cartel .
all right , they &apos;re definitely part of gabriel &apos;s crew .
all right , he &apos;s targeting somebody on the inside .
keep hpd away , jerry ,
and have arena security stand down , all right ?
we don &apos;t want to spook gabriel ,
and we can &apos;t risk any collateral damage .
this has to be a surgical strike .
will do .
i have a list of vips and dignitaries in attendance .
looks like the governor ,
the mayor , a couple state senators .
no .
those are the only people
in that place with a security detail .
and besides , it &apos;s not gabriel &apos;s style to kill politicians .
it &apos;s bad for business . who else you got on that list ?
bunch of celebrities .
no , forget that .
you know what , jerry ?
cross @-@ reference all the other vips
on that list with criminal records .
what , you think this is a power move ?
all right , so listen , ever since gabriel landed back on oahu ,
he &apos;s been rebuilding his business .
assassinating a key player in front of millions of people--
that sends a very clear message
to the rest of his rivals that says nobody &apos;s untouchable .
haynes keeps coming and continuing to pound nakano
at the center of the ring .
this kid &apos;s got to find a way to slow haynes down .
okay , i got some candidates .
who ?
goro shioma , head of the yakuza .
well , normally , i &apos;d say yes .
but he just aligned himself with shioma .
doesn &apos;t matter .
gabriel &apos;s only loyalty is to himself .
if there &apos;s a benefit to killing shioma ,
i &apos;m telling you , he will do it . who else ?
akela makuakane ,
acting boss of the makuakane family .
and the acting boss of the triads , wong yu .
all right , we got the heads
of three of the most powerful crime families in oahu ,
all in the same place , unarmed , completely in the open .
which one is he after ?
we got to assume it &apos;s all three .
nakano is in trouble !
haynes lands a big left , followed by a right .
he backs up nakano with a solid combination to the body .
use the jab , luke !
you got to use the jab , baby !
nakano &apos;s corner is pleading
with him to fight back .
go to your corner .
and as the third round ends ,
luke is barely hanging on .
yo , champ , come here .
the first three rounds have been a walk
in the park for devon haynes .
not so for luke nakano ,
who has taken a beating up to this point .
luke , listen , baby , you &apos;re not paying attention .
yeah , it &apos;s all about the angles .
you got to turn him to your left and come up with the uppercut .
it &apos;s there . you got to take it .
look at me . listen to me . look at me .
you got to stay focused , you understand ?
this is for your brother . you want to honor your brother ?
then get out there and fight .
the fighters charge into the center of the ring ,
as we begin the fourth round .
one thing is for certain :
luke nakano has shown tremendous heart .
there is no quit in this kid .
but heart alone doesn &apos;t win fights .
all right , abby , i need you to find the control room ,
get up on the cameras ,
see if you can get eyes on gabriel &apos;s people .
chin , i need you up top , all right ?
if there was a long gun in that bag
they carried in here ,
they &apos;re gonna be looking for a sniper &apos;s perch ,
and we need to find it .
copy .
danny , you , me and lou are gonna secure the potential targets .
now , gabriel &apos;s men are gonna be watching ,
so we need to move fast , all right ?
a devastating left hook !
down goes nakano !
this could be it !
go to your corner !
nakano is staying down on one knee .
one !
the ref starts the count .
two .
this is not looking good ...
three !
for local boy luke nakano .
luke ? !
luke !
hey , get up already !
you hear me ?
get up !
luke ? luke , come on , baby .
this is for the championship . get up , baby .
you can do it .
four !
devon haynes is mocking the crowd
with his version of the hula dance .
five !
it &apos;s this type of brazen behavior
that fans here were hoping luke nakano would
put to an end tonight .
six !
nakano is back up on his feet !
the referee checks him to see if he wants to continue .
he does .
all right , you ready ?
you have to wonder ,
how much longer will his corner allow him to take this pounding .
fight !
nakano charges forward , lands a solid combination .
haynes counters , missing with a right and then a left .
nakano comes upstairs , connects with a solid left hand .
and for the first time in this fight ,
the challenger looks like he might belong in the ring
with the champ .
the bell sounds , ending the fourth round .
we may have a fight on our hands .
something happened at the end of that round .
maybe it was haynes taunting the crowd ,
or maybe luke is just tired of getting hit .
whatever it is , nakano looks like
a different fighter than we saw down on one knee
in the last round .
haynes &apos; corner has to be a bit concerned .
excuse me . where are the guys that were sitting here ?
but it looks like luke may have found the momentum .
round five gets under way in just a few moments .
chin , someone activated the alarm
to the emergency staircase just ahead of you .
it leads to the top of the arena .
almost there .
okay , i got a busted lock . i &apos;m heading up .
be careful .
nakano charges out of his corner .
nakano lands a big right uppercut !
that definitely got haynes &apos;s attention .
grover , go up aisle 17 .
you should see delarosa on your right .
i got him .
haynes misses with a combination .
nakano lands a big right hook !
get your hand off that pistol .
get your hand off that pistol ,
and drop it right here , right now .
i &apos;m not saying it again .
put your hands to your side ,
do exactly what i tell you to do .
a solid combination from nakano ...
get going .
has the champion backing up here in the fifth round .
nakano with a solid right hand
that backs haynes into the corner !
steve , you should be able to see him now .
first row on the right .
the champ looks like he might be in trouble .
goro ... goro , listen to me .
your life is in danger .
you need to come with me right now , okay ?
i &apos;m feeling quite comfortable ...
and safe where i &apos;m sitting .
okay , i don &apos;t think you understand what i &apos;m saying .
you need to get up and come with me right now .
don &apos;t think about it . sit down .
sit down . sit down .
this is unbelievable ! haynes is hurt !
