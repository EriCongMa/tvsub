When you become an intern,
there's a ceremony where you get your white coat.
Like magic...
You're a doctor.
My parents came to my white coat ceremony.
I can still picture them, so happy...
so proud.
Hey, we need to get the board together, and...
Congratulations.
They say your life flashes before your eyes
right before you die.
The important moments.
The moments that tested you.
The moments that made you who you are.
April, you're getting married.
Unless I'm not.
I just heard.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I don't know about my life flashing before me.
I was thinking about my white coat...
And how I'm glad I have it on me now.
Um, will you overhead page Richard Webber for me?
Right away.
It's the moment my life started.
Seems fitting it should be on me when it ends.
Dr. Richard Webber,
please call the E.R.
Dr. Richard Webber, please call the E.R.
Oh, baby's sleepin'.
Okay, we should get started.
Um, Bailey, we have some board business that we need to disc--
I'm not going anywhere.
Me and this baby got Bailey business to discuss.
Don't we? Yes, Mr. Derek Bailey Shepherd.
Yes, we do.
What does Zola think of him?
Oh, she wants to take him to day care for show and tell.
Where's Richard?
I paged all the board members.
Well, Avery should be here, too.
Yeah, well, he was being a hero last night.
He dislocated his shoulder saving a kid from the bus crash.
What bus crash?
She had a baby. She doesn't know things.
So tell me.
A church was evacuating some people,
and their bus overturned.
Good news is, everyone survived,
and there are no major injuries.
And the bad news?
Everything else.
The blood bank is flooded,
and the E.R. looks like it was ransacked.
So we need to close the E.R.?
We're dangerously low on meds.
Personnel can't make it in due to the flooding.
So we need to close the E.R.
Can we do that? But can we do that?
You are the board.
I am telling you that E.R. cannot open today.
What do we need?
I mean, I can try to coordinate with our suppliers.
I had a baby. I'm not dead.
If they have it, then we want it.
In the meantime, let's make sure
that our inpatients are taken care of and discharge who we can.
Like me.
No, you just had a major abdominal surgery.
You're gonna stay right here.
All right, airport's just reopened.
I just put Dr. Boswell in a cab.
Who's Dr. Boswell?
She's the woman Arizona slept with last night.
What are you doing? We're closed to incoming traumas, guys.
Tell that to them.
There was a mudslide near Madrona.
A bunch of cops and firefighters got hurt doing evacuations.
There are also a bunch of civilian casualties as well.
What about Seattle Pres?
They're worse off than we are.
All right, let's do it. Help me get this sling off.
Get me every suture kit, laceration tray,
Foley, and chest tube that you can.
We're gonna come down. We're sending a triage down.
What?
My shift is over. I was gonna go home and go to sleep.
I'm so tired and hungry.
My teeth have stuff growing on them, and...
Can you pretend you didn't hear any of that?
Yep.
Yeah, yeah.
Coming through. Straight ahead.
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait.
Okay, I'm not doing it in an on call room.
I'm a grown-up with a house.
Your house has a tree in the middle of it.
Wait, wait. Did you have sex with Leah in here?
And Heather?
Oh, god. I don't think I can do this.
Yeah, I can.
No. No, no, no.
I need this.
We're here. We're ready. Let's just do it. Two minutes.
No one's gonna die if we don't answer our pagers
for two minutes, right?
Right.
Crap! Now I'm thinking about dead people.
Lenny Shulte, captain of ladder company 54.
Unconscious at the scene with a G.C.S. of 13.
B.P.'s been constantly dropping.
Last was 85 over 60.
I can't... get... a good... breath.
Increase his O2 to 10 liters.
Can you tell me if anything fell on you, on your chest?
I don't know.
Last thing I remember, helping the old lady out of her house.
Did sh-she make it?
I'll check.
5818 Shore Drive. And my guys--
I-I got 12 guys out there.
Turn him. Turn him!
Okay, looks like he aspirated mud.
Let's get him into trauma room one.
Let's get a chest X-ray and start him on antibiotics.
Let's go!
Go. Coming through!
Owen and I...
Oh, you know, I don't even know what to call it.
Ended it? Broke up?
I feel like I'm gonna die.
You always end it, and then you start it again.
Yeah, but this is different.
Okay.
Oh, I'm gonna go to sleep.
Oh, just for, like, 20 minutes.
Oh, Robbins cheating on Callie?
Oh! Did not see that coming.
I know.
And "Bailey" is a good name.
But two Baileys? You don't think it's gonna be confusing?
No, because... if I say, "Bailey peed on me,"
I think it's safe to assume that I'm talking about my son.
Very good. Seriously, wake me in 20?
Okay.
Thank you.
I feel like I'm gonna die.
Shepherd?
Yeah, Lydia Ashford. Injuries to the upper extremities.
My house.
And she's worried about her house.
Wait. Uh, 5818 Shore Drive?
Yes. Is it gone?
I don't know.
Uh, Karev, Kepner's in Trauma One.
Get her to tell her patient 5818 Shore Drive made it.
Kepner!
Tell your guy 5818 is out.
I could've done that.
I'm sorry, but I need a neuro consult in Bay 7.
The guy's unconscious, but he's stable.
Look what I found in outpatient surgery.
Ross, stay here. I paged Brooks.
Have her get Mrs. Ashford a pan scan
of the head, neck, chest, and abdomen.
Well, I can take her.
No, have Brooks do it.
Uh, the mayor's on the phone,
wants to know about casualties from the mudslide.
I told him it was soon to tell,
but he wants to hear it from you.
Hey, um, go find Dr. Webber.
I'm supposed to give Dr. Brooks a message from Dr. Shepherd.
Uh, is that life-threatening?
Because not having enough general surgeons
in here right now is life-threatening.
Go find Webber.
Have you seen Dr. Webber?
Uh, last time I saw him was after surgery.
He went to go check on the generator.
Where's that?
How the hell should I know?
Lidocaine and a bunch of 4X4s.
Can you take that to Hunt? I got paged by Shepherd.
Uh... he wants you to go find Webber.
Are you sure? He just paged me 9-1-2.
That's our special little code.
It means more emergent than 9-1-1. Get it?
All I know is they need Webber here,
and Shepherd wants you to get him.
Apparently, he went to deal with the generator.
And I'm walking toward the car,
and suddenly the hillside just goes...
and I'm falling.
I see my squad car coming down on top of me,
so I managed to roll out of the way,
but my... my leg was caught under it.
Can you salvage it?
I think so. We'll get ortho down here.
I'm gonna take a look
at that nasty laceration on your neck, though.
It's a lot of embedded debris.
Hey, Tilden? Everyone make it out of the mud?
Everyone's accounted for except Lauenstein,
Phil G, and Brian.
Brian's my fiance?
Don't worry. You know him. He's gonna be fine.
Look, he's probably giving himself a mud facial.
You know, look good for the wedding.
Yeah, well, if he had cold feet,
he shoulda just said so.
Dr. Webber?
Dr. Webber!
Oh, crap. Dr. Webber!
Oscar Hallis.
Shepherd says he's probably concussed.
We're gonna do a head C.T.
I'm more concerned about infection.
That is a nasty cut on his leg.
Well, Dr. Wilson's irrigating it with saline.
But we couldn't find any bacitracin,
we're gonna hang some ampicillin.
No ampicillin! He's allergic to penicillin.
How do you know?
What the hell?
Military trick.
Someone triaged him at the scene--
probably whoever dug him out.
Substitute cefazolin and keep a close eye for allergic reaction.
All right. Get some cefazolin.
We don't have it.
Well, find it.
People, check your patients for vitals
written in sharpie on their body.
Someone at the scene knew what they were doing.
Might've just saved this guy's life.
Oh. Sharpie here, too.
And it indicates he's getting worse fast.
His B.P. was better in the field. Crap.
Okay, we need to stabilize his pelvis.
Okay, you're gonna need to pull harder.
Talk to me, Murphy.
Aaron Garcia.
C.T. showed an open book pelvic fracture
on a liver lac with hemorrhage.
Harder, Murphy.
I'm afraid if I pull too hard, I'm gonna make it worse.
You can't--move. Can't make it worse.
It's already as bad as it can be.
All right, I need to get this guy upstairs
and put on an ex fix immediately.
Murphy, book an O.R.
and ask Bailey to scrub in.
What do you need Bailey for?
He has a liver lac. I need a general surgeon.
Well, I'm a general surgeon, and it's all hands on deck--
Get me Bailey!
Do you have cefazolin?
Yeah, they were hoarding it in O.B.
Bastards. Give me some.
Ahh! I'll trade you for a chest tube.
And a granola bar.
I don't have a granola bar.
Liar.
You've got granola bar breath.
Do you want the cef?
Fine! Yeah.
What is going on out there?
Huge mudslide. Gotta go.
Lot of crush injuries. Super cute baby.
I thought the E.R. was closed!
Where's Brooks?
Uh, she was busy, so I went ahead and did the scan.
It shows a small subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Her exam?
Uh, neuro checks have been stable.
All right, tell Brooks I want her to continue on
with q 1 hour neuro checks.
But--
Don't argue with me. Just find Brooks.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Ashford, how are you feeling?
My house.
5818.
Crown molding in every room.
All right, right now I'm worried about you.
Your fingers are crushed. I need an ortho consult, please.
On it.
Okay, I need you to look up here for me.
Crown molding in every room.
Okay. How's he doing?
Captain Shulte has decreased breath sounds on the right,
worsening tachypnea and persistent SATs in the 80s.
Took me forever to find a chest tube.
I need a-a list.
Who--who's still missing?
Okay, Lenny, something in your chest cavity's
preventing you from breathing well,
so we're gonna insert a chest tube
which should help you breathe better.
Is there anyone that we can call for you?
Mm. Call... call Marla, but...
don't--don't let her come up here. Road's not safe.
Guys, you're gonna need to go.
All right.
Okay. Come on. Hang in there, Lenny.
Okay, you're gonna feel a little snip. Here you go.
Got a chest tube.
Too late. Already got one.
Okay, uh, let me help.
Oh! Oh, god, oh, god, it's poop! Oh!
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
The tube is in a good position.
I suspect a diaphragmatic rupture.
Lenny, Lenny, I believe your colon has been pushed up into your chest.
Now the risk of infection is extremely high.
Now if I'm right, we're gonna need to open you up.
All right?
Give me the chart, please.
Here you go, doctor.
All right, let's get an x-ray and prep him for surgery.
I'll scrub in with you. Call Bailey.
Ask her to man the E.R., please.
Go.
Dr. Bailey, um...
You smell like feces.
Uh, I know.
So why you standing next to me if you smell like feces?
Dr. Hunt would like you to take over in the E.R.
while he goes up to surgery.
Tell Dr. Hunt I'm about to go in with... Torres
on this gentleman's broken pelvis,
so I can't man the E.R. Where's Dr. Webber?
I don't know.
Okay, well, find him, pl--
Someone needs to find Richard Webber!
Coming through!
Webber's pulse is thready.
Systolic's 80.
Brooks has massive head trauma.
Pupils are unresponsive.
Let's get her on her side.
Ready? Move over here. 1, 2, 3, go.
Get her for a C.T. Ross?
Ross! Let's go. Go!
V tach. Um, give me one of EPI.
Come on. Come on.
Charge to 120.
Got it.
Clear.
Okay, charge to 200. Clear.
Charge to 200.
Clear.
I know you guys are freaked out,
but we have patients, so you need to focus.
Figure out who Ross and Brooks were covering.
Uh, Ross was doing neuro checks on Crown Molding...
No breath sounds.
So I can take over those.
Allergic guy is awake,
and his head C.T. came back clear.
Last time I checked his B.P., it was good, like, uh,
like... 115 over... 70.
I wrote it down somewhere.
What the hell?
Well, the electronic charts are still down,
So I'm winging it. Crap.
I know I have it.
Let's charge him again.
Clear!
Give him another EPI.
Come on.
Oscar, I'm Dr. Karev.
Glad you're awake. Your head C.T. is clear,
And we're gonna have plastics sew up your leg.
Awesome.
All right. B.P. Looks good. 115 over 85.
Our electronic charts are down.
Hope you don't mind a temporary tattoo.
Go for it, doc.
I already got one.
Look, I know Heather's a friend,
And if you need more time, I can--
No. I'm... I'm fine.
Good. Go help prep the patient.
I know that you wanted Bailey, but she's working on Richard.
Callie, we should--
Should what?
Not sleep with other people? Respect our wedding vows?
We should put our problems aside right now,
because this guy deserves that.
Well, thank god you found them, Ross.
Let's just hope you found them in time.
Damn it. Subdural.
Oh, god.
Let's go.
Lines in.
Swan, please.
Okay, let's hook him back up.
Labs.
Okay, uh, troponin?
Elevated at 4.
Hmm. Crit?
Fine at 40.
Potassium's 4.5. Bicarb 18.
Everything else is normal.
Lactate.
2.
No, that--that can't be right. He should be acidotic.
His girth is increasing as we stand here.
Look, it says--
I know what it says, but it's wrong.
Redo it.
All right, uh, charge again to 200.
Clear.
Karev? What's going on with Richard?
Uh, echo shows very little heart activity,
and C.V.P.'s elevated.
Yang's about to set up for a balloon pump.
All right, well, if we're sending him up to surgery,
let's make sure we have an adequate blood supply for transfusion.
On it.
If--if you need to go deal with more dire patients,
I get it. Go. I'm fine.
Actually, you're not, Sasha. It's important that
we go ahead and debde and clean out this wound
as soon as possible to prevent infection.
Sasha... are you supposed to be walking around in that thing?
I can't sit still.
I'm waiting on plastic surgery to sew me up.
That's this guy.
You mind if I, uh, if I sit here?
That kinda looks like Brian's handwriting.
Yeah, I know. My glasses got knocked off in the slide.
I could barely see a thing, but it could've been.
But was it his voice?
I can't remember. I'm sorry, Sash.
I was kinda out of it, you know?
I'm sorry.
Just a little discoloration in the tissue.
I'd like to run a few tests
just to make sure there's nothing to worry about.
I'm just gonna numb you up, okay?
Yeah. Go ahead.
I'm telling you, that's his writing.
We need blood, Mer. There's no time to screen, type, or cross.
All right? I need all the o-neg I can get.
Okay, but wait. Tell me what's going on?
And staff. Lab techs, scrub nurses.
I need E.T.A.S on when you can get people in here.
Page me when you can.
Alex, pick up the baby.
Mer, I don't have time.
Alex. Pick up my baby.
No, the baby is for you,
so that you can stop freaking out.
Now just relax and tell me what's going on.
Webber and Brooks are down. They were electrocuted.
It's bad, but we're--we're-- we're--we're dealing with it.
I just need you to get on the phone
And help us get those supplies, okay?
Okay. Okay.
Here.
Your turn not to freak out.
Okay, forceps.
Metz.
I have a status update on Dr. Webber.
Okay.
Dr. Yang is attempting to place a balloon pump,
but he keeps coding.
She's placing one bedside without fluoro?
She could rupture his aorta.
Do you want me to get Dr. Yang on the phone?
You just said she's threading a balloon pump.
She is, but...
Then how is she gonna talk on the phone?
I didn't... mean...
Retract her.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Okay, let's run the bowel.
The abdomen's fully contaminated.
Just run the bowel.
We're gonna resect this and get out of here.
Let's get ready to pack him.
Come on, Lenny.
It's too quiet.
Talk.
Y-you're doing good.
You... are not going to rupture the aorta
because you... are Cristina Yang.
Attach this to the console.
You are the star of your class.
I always knew it. I said it to anyone who'd ask--
"Look out for Cristina Yang." I-I said it to Webber.
"Cristina Yang is good."
"Cristina Yang would not rupture an aorta."
"Cristina Ya--"
Oh, god, you did it.
Oh, dear lord. He has a steady heartbeat.
Oh, praise Jesus. You didn't rupture his aorta.
Secure this device and get him up to the I.C.U.
We just bought him some time.
Hug me back, Cristina Yang.
I know you are not a hugger,
but right now I need you to hug me back.
Hey, Mrs. Ashford.
Did you find out?
Press against my hands with the bottoms of your feet.
Find out what?
About my house.
It has the most beautiful crown moldings.
Now with your hands.
I'm sorry. I haven't had time to ask about your house.
How's your vision?
Any blurriness?
My vision?
I don't care about my--
S-stop.
Stop this nonsense.
Just call somebody, please. Find out about my house.
Ma'am, this isn't nonsense.
I'm trying to help you, and I have about 20 other patients,
so checking on your house is the last thing
on my mind right now.
People got injured badly,
so you need to stop worrying about your house,
and you need to tell me if you are experiencing
any blurriness of vision.
His lactate is 6.
6?
Uh, he has an acute abdomen. Get me an O.R. and a good staff.
I'll take, uh, Linda, if she's available. Norman.
Are you out of your mind?
Norman's M.I.A.
Okay, Anna, then.
I'll make some phone calls.
You're not opening him up.
The electrical injury
may have caused intra-abdominal tissue damage
and likely progressing because of his heart failing.
He barely tolerated the balloon pump.
I need to get in there and debride the dead tissue.
There's no way his heart can handle the anesthesia.
His lactate is 6.
He needs sustained cardiac I.C.U.
He's gonna die if we don't do anything.
We're not doing nothing.
We're gonna let the balloon pump work..
I am the attending...
And keep his fluids tight.
You are a fellow. I make the decisions here.
Well, I own this hospital. You work for me.
He's bleeding through the packing,
and there's still stool coming out.
Damn it. We need to take it out and resect more intestines.
How's his I.N.R.?
The last one was 6.
Okay, give him factor VII, F.F.P.S and platelets.
Faster, Kepner.
He's having arrhythmias.
Talk to me.
Uh... I can't get a pulse.
I think he's in P.E.A.
Starting compressions.
I know this is difficult,
but Brooks is our patient.
I'm telling you this to remind you to be her doctor,
not her friend right now.
There are decisions to be made in there
that will affect not only her ability to be a surgeon...
her speech, her ability to function, her life.
But those decisions are ultimately mine.
I will not make them lightly.
But I will make them quickly,
and you need to do exactly as I say. No questions.
Can you do that?
I think so.
That's not good enough.
Yes, sir. I-I can do it, sir.
I'll take this to the labs,
and Dr. Avery will let you know the results.
Thank you.
Hey. Heard you were looking for this guy.
Brian!
I was so worried. Get over here and give me a kiss, you jerk.
Baby, I'm all muddy.
I don't care.
Are you okay?
Mmm. I knew that was your handwriting.
What are you talking about?
On Oscar.
Didn't you pull him out?
No.
Someone triaged a bunch of guys at the scene
and wrote vitals down with a sharpie.
Yeah, I wish that was me.
I was just sitting in an air pocket,
twiddling my thumbs.
Uh, I actually think I'm having some trouble moving.
I think I broke some ribs.
Let's get those checked out.
Yeah.
Um, I heard Lenny was in surgery. How's he doing?
I don't know.
P.H. is down to 7.12.
Come on, Lenny.
He's been down 20 minutes.
Did you say "Yes"?
Sir?
To Matthew.
I helped with his proposal.
Oh, uh, yeah. Yes. I said "Yes."
Good.
I like him. He's a good guy.
I mean, these guys--
These first responders-- they're all good guys.
Hate to give up.
Damn it, Lenny.
Time of death--1556.
It's Dr. Karev. The firefighters are asking for an update.
Chaplain's on his way to tell Marla and the girls.
She's gonna wanna come in
and see him.
Absolutely.
Let's bring her in. Full lights and sirens.
On it.
Lauenstein's still missing.
We gotta bring him back. We gotta do that for Lenny.
If I could walk, I'd be out on that pile.
Excuse me.
Kelly clamp.
Suction.
Guys, he's almost lost his entire blood volume.
If you don't get control up there--
it's already done.
I controlled the bleeding using a pringle maneuver.
Wow. Cool.
Don't be so impressed. It's fairly standard.
Yeah, I know, but you did it so well.
I was wrong before, Murphy,
When I implied that Dr. Robbins wasn't a real general surgeon.
She is. She's an excellent general surgeon.
It's okay. We've all said things that we shouldn't have.
Oh, Owen.
Owen, no. You're not gonna "Owen" this.
No personal relationships. This is professional.
This is Dr. Hunt.
What is going on?
Dr. Webber has an acute abdomen.
He needs surgery.
He barely survived the balloon pump.
His lactate is 6...
and holding.
So what if it's holding? Something is dead inside of him.
It's not gonna get undead.
It is way too risky, and you know it.
I would rather take the risk
than just wait for what we know is gonna kill him.
Stop, stop. What does his healthcare directive say
about extraordinary measures?
Whoa. I smell dead people.
Oh, and spiders. Dead people killed by spiders.
Okay, let's find his personnel file.
Oh! Okay, I, uh, got it.
"Webber."
Oh, no.
What, he doesn't have a healthcare directive?
No. He has one.
I don't understand.
Richard designated you as his medical power of attorney.
But he can't make me next of kin
without talking to me first.
He did.
After Adele died, he revised his directive.
But--
Meredith, I know this is a shock,
but we don't have much time.
Right now you need to make a decision.
His heart is too weak, Meredith.
His heart can take it.
You trust me, right? You named your baby after me.
Hey, hey!
No personal relationships.
The amount of electricity he had in his body
should have killed him instantly,
But it didn't, which tells me that the heart damage
isn't as bad as you think.
He coded four times.
And we got him back!
Oh, and now you just sound idiotic.
Ah-ah! Dr. Yang!
No, seriously. You sound like a family member
who googled "Electrocution"
and is trying to remain optimistic.
Well, I am optimistic.
Well, Richard should have made Bailey his family member,
because that is how she's acting right now.
I wish he would've.
Well, he didn't. He put Meredith down.
Why would he do that?
And she knows as well as I do that
electric shock can cause death of tissues which could start a whole
inflammatory cascade unless I debride what's been damaged.
Well, he'll have to handle it for a day to let his heart rest.
And then...
He can't handle it?
Okay, now you sound like an idiot.
Letting that tissue die is like taking a gun
and killing him.
Why wouldn't he tell me?
I don't know, but he didn't.
And it's on you, so you have to decide, Mer.
Yes. Meredith, please.
Damn it.
Just damn it.
It's massive. But...
we can just evacuate it, right?
It doesn't change our plan.
Do what we can and hope for the best.
Can you see her vital signs?
Yeah. Bad.
At least Shane's happy.
Heather's out of the competition.
That was mean... even for you.
It was a joke. I'm trying to lighten the mood.
Our friend is dying.
You don't even like her.
Oh, my god.
Just ignore her, Steph.
Well, she usually does.
We should get back.
I like heather.
I know.
You know what I was thinking before you guys came in here?
I was thinking I wish my mother were here
to see my kids.
I was wondering if she'd make a good grandmother.
But you know what that is?
That's delusional thinking.
Because my mother would make a horrible grandmother,
because she was a horrible mother.
So... I'm delusional and hormonal.
And I can't trust my delusional thoughts.
I have to rely on the labs.
So we need to run the lactate again,
and if it's above 6, we're going to do the surgery.
And if it's not, we're not.
Hey, where's Brian?
Who's Brian?
Bed three.
Broken ribs.
Dead fianc.
Oh! Him. Mm-hmm.
Um, he left. One of his friends is still missing.
All right. Uh, listen up, guys.
You wanna do something for your friends that are hurt?
Sure.
How about donating some blood?
We can do that.
All right, just line up behind these doctors,
and they're gonna help you out.
That way, they're tied to the table and they can't take off.
I'll give some blood.
I'll help the blood bank staff get set up.
Were you out at the pile?
Yeah.
Do you know if 5818 Shore Drive is still standing?
It's my patient's house, and she's worried.
Sharpie lady's here?
Sharpie lady?
I was evacuating her when the mudslide happened,
and she runs back in her house.
I lose it on her, 'cause I'm thinking
she's looking for her wallet or something,
and I'm like,
"Lady, that crap can be replaced."
And she comes running out with a sharpie
and immediately starts digging guys out
and taking their vitals.
That's why her fingers are crushed.
I feel kinda bad for yelling at her.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Crown molding's a badass.
I was just thinking about
when Richard caught me living in the limb room.
I was a resident.
Before George. Anyway...
I was in there one night,
and he--Richard walked in on me dancing in my underwear.
I was so embarrassed.
I mean... he was the chief.
Are you okay?
No. No, I'm...
No, I don't dance in my underwear anymore.
Lactate's 9.
Go.
You agree with Meredith's decision?
I think it was a coin toss.
You gonna be in there with Bailey?
Yeah.
Okay, if he has abnormal bleeding,
give him factor VII.
He responds to it well.
Okay.
And make sure his pulses are checked hourly.
That is really important. You wanna write that down?
No, I think I...
You know, let me put that in your phone.
You're a challenging person.
I know.
The swelling is bad.
Shepherd's had to open up a bigger chunk of her skull.
There's no way she's getting out of this without major deficits.
What are you doing?
Heather's hemorrhaging.
Yeah, I heard.
She could die.
All right, look, don't go there.
She's my age, my class.
Her locker's right next to mine.
I used her deodorant without telling her,
and she could die.
I know. It sucks.
It all sucks.
Mm. Wait, wait. This is bad. We shouldn't.
Yeah.
But I want to.
Okay.
Wait.
Did you have sex with any of my friends in this closet?
Okay. No. This isn't happening.
I gotta go.
I was just gonna get some lidocaine,
but I'm not gonna slip on a used condom, am I?
Screw you.
Did you hear the news about me being a big slut got out?
Yeah.
It's mortifying.
But, you know, I mean, I think that--
I think that we're gonna be okay.
You know, I-I think--I think it's gonna make us stronger.
You know, like a bone.
You know, sometimes you-- you have to--
you have to break it in order for it to heal correctly.
And I think that maybe Callie and I...
That's what I was gonna tell Callie.
Like, um, an ortho metaphor?
What do you think?
I think you should stick to
"I'm sorry I'm such a slut."
Yeah. Good call.
Hey, Mrs. Ashford.
You wanna press against my hands with the bottoms of your feet?
I heard you're kind of a hero.
Oh, my god.
Mrs. Ashford.
I could use some help over here!
You're gonna be good, Dougie,
okay? You're gonna be fine.
Douglas Lauenstein, multiple crush injuries,
B.P. 105 over 72.
Get him up to trauma 3. Hey, where do you think you're going?
Sash, we got him.
He was still in the rig.
Is he gonna be okay?
Yeah, he's gonna be okay, but I gotta head back out.
We're trying to stabilize the area,
make sure we don't lose any more houses.
You're not going anywhere. You're still bleeding.
Well, just patch me up.
No, I already did that.
Well, maybe this guy can help.
All right, Sasha, we just got your studies back,
and this is necrotizing fasciitis.
It is aggressive,
and we need to get you up to surgery right away.
How--how did I--
Uh, the water and the mud that you were stuck in.
Both of those are breeding grounds for this type
of bacteria.
Well, wait--
It's a flesh-eating bacteria, Brian, all right?
What's most important is that
we get her prepped and ready right away. Let's go.
A doctor puts on his white coat to save lives,
defy death, but once he takes it off,
he's vulnerable,
just like anybody else.
Human.
Ma'am...
I'm Dr. Kepner.
I worked on your husband.
Would you like to see him?
Okay.
We're all gonna die.
We don't get much say over how or when.
His ring.
Thought you'd want it back.
I'm so, so sorry.
But we do get to decide how we're gonna live.
So do it.
Decide.
Is this the life you want to live?
Is this the person you want to love?
Is this the best you can be?
Can you be stronger?
Kinder?
Be a good friend.
Tell me I made the right decision.
More compassionate?
You made the right decision.
Oh, damn it. There's blood in the temporal horn.
I'm gonna have to do a temporal lobectomy.
Dr. Shepherd.
She'll have motor and memory deficits if you--
I'm trying to save her life.
This is my fault.
Shane.
No, I did this.
You didn't do anything. This is not your fault.
This just happened.
Now I can't have you in here if you can't hold it together.
Can you be in here?
Decide.
Yeah.
Dissectors.
Breathe in.
Tell me again.
Breathe out.
You made the right decision.
And decide.
