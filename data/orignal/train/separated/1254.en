It's Sara Harvey. She's dead.
Em saw something on Jenna's laptop
that can link back to A.D.
The case is officially closed.
Tell me what to do?
You obviously can't tell Ezra.
What good would it do?
I'll delete the call.
Mrs. Grunwald.
She's a psychic. A real psychic.
And she seems to like us in some disturbing creepy sort of way.
Bye, Caleb.
Bye.
Maybe we could just skip the headache and elope.
布置
I'm callin' again for Dr. Cochran.
It's Noel Kahn.
Tell her I'm running out of time and patience.
Mary had a second child.
So Charlotte had a biological brother or sister.
I'm Agent Lee from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
You were involved with Nicole Gordon. Correct?
Yes, I was.
We have reason to believe that she may be alive.
Okay, so we know that Noel Kahn stole
the Mary Drake file from Toby's AirStream.
How's Yvonne doing?
She's, she's okay.
Toby's gonna spend some time with her.
And then right after he got that file, he called Dr. Cochran.
Sounds like Jenna and Noel are on the same path that we are.
Only they're ahead of us.
But who burned us out of the storm cellar?
Somebody who didn't want us to know
that Mary Drake had a second child.
A.D.?
Noel Kahn.
You guys, Noel's been in the middle
of everything that's been happening to us.
He clearly has more A-ness than anyone else out there.
I wouldn't have put it that way, Hanna.
Hold on, Ali, you know Noel better than any of us.
I'm not proud to say it, but you're probably right.
I trusted him once, but then I realized
he was spying on me for Charlotte.
But you had something on him? I mean, from years ago.
Yeah, that's right.
Must have been good.
Do you remember that frat party
I took you guys to, freshman year?
We made those fake IDs.
Yeah, all the guys were super drunk. So?
Sorority girl fell down the stairs.
Oh, my God.
She didn't fall. Noel pushed her.
See, no story with Noel Kahn in it has a happy ending.
What if you went to Noel now?
Threatened to go to the police or..
No, it's too late.
His family paid the girl off years ago.
He got away with it.
Yeah, like he does with everything.
Exactly why we shouldn't be arguing whether Noel's A
A.D., Uber A or whatever.
God, I can't believe you guys.
Hey.
Don't.
When are they gonna realize that Noel Kahn
is the one that we're after?
They just wanna be certain, okay?
Mary and Jenna are still out there.
Oh, come on. How much more proof do we need
than the words "I see you" being written on our car
outside of the storm cellar?
Those were the exact words
written on Ezra's car at Camp Mona.
I know, okay? I get it. It's just that--
You don't believe me either.
Look, we have to be completely
positive before we do anything rash.
Well, I am.
And by now, if you're not,
I don't know what's gonna change your mind.
Hanna.
Hanna, look out!
So you're fine?
Really fine?
I'm fine.
Really?
Fine.
So, um, how's it going over here?
Well, not that great. I mean, I'm going over all the material
that you and Spencer took photos of from the lock box
but everything except for Mary's DNA
is in some code that I can't crack.
Yet, right?
I'm doing my best.
Why DNA?
Your guess is as good as mine.
What has Mary been up to?
There's no sign of her, at Alison's or the Lost Woods.
What about Jenna?
Any tapping around we need to be worried about?
No, she hasn't left her room.
I guess Noel's taken a leave while Jenna practices her flute.
Hey, um, speaking of Noel, give me your phone.
What's that?
This is your new phone.
It's 100% bug free.
I have some for the rest of you guys too.
You can't be too careful with Noel and Jenna on the prowl.
Really? I hate breaking in new phones.
Well, Noel's found his way into your dreams.
That's close enough.
I mean, I don't even know why I'm surprised.
I did this to myself. I deleted that call from Ezra's phone
and now it's coming back, and it's gonna bite me...
Aria, take a deep breath.
It's been proven to prevent explosions in small women.
Ezra's with the authorities right now.
Nicole could be alive, Emily.
First off, you can't root for her not to be alive.
No. No, of course not.
And-and second, you deleted the call for all the right reasons.
You were tryin' to spare Ezra.
I lied to him, Emily.
Lied to me about what?
There was a call on your phone.
It said that it was from Nicole, so I picked it up
and-and no one answered, so I deleted it.
You what?
It didn't make sense, Ezra.
And I didn't wanna get your hopes up.
Okay. Okay.
Ezra.
Well, uh, guess what?
One of the trucks in the aid convoy that Nicole was with
was spotted near a rebel compound or
or something in Colombia, so...
Have they found her?
Well, the military's, uh, going into the jungle
in about two hours, and they don't know
what they're gonna find.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, me too.
Okay, um, I think I'm gonna leave.
Um, yeah, I guess I'll go too.
I was just gonna shower, and then I'm gonna head back.
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
Um, I'll see you.
So has Ezra heard anything else?
Has he called Aria?
No.
Aria's going crazy waiting. Obviously, he is too.
Yeah.
Well, I guess it's a big day for all of us.
What do you mean?
I'm going back to Rosewood High School today.
Back to teaching my class.
Today?
I, I know you've talked about it
but do you really think now is the time?
I mean, are you even ready?
Well, the Welby social worker and Dr. Sullivan
gave me a clean bill of health.
That's great, but it's been less than two weeks
since Archer Dunhill...
Stole all my money.
Look, Em, I'm broke. I have nothing.
And unless Jason comes back from meeting
with his forensic accountant in Philadelphia
with a truckload of cash, I, I honestly have no choice.
It's 20 minutes to the first bell. I should go.
Wish me luck.
You'll be great.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I think so.
I took the liberty of..
How's Alison doing?
Better than can be expected.
Well, she's lucky to have a good friend like you.
Hi, I called ahead for a few dozen pastries.
My name is Hackett.
Thank you.
Principal Hackett.
Hi. How are you?
Emily Fields.
I-I was just thinking about you.
Really? Why?
We've got a job opening at the high school.
Head swim coach.
You got your degree, right?
Yeah, one last class, but I'm testing out.
Well, then if you're in town permanently
you should think about applying.
We would love to have you back.
That is, unless you've already gotten a job somewhere else.
No. No, well, at The Radley
but, thanks for letting me know.
I-I'll definitely think about it.
Splendid. Well, I gotta go.
Hell hath no fury like my teachers
when I forget "Thank God It's Danish Day."
Thank you.
Yeah.
"Thank God It's Danish Day."
It's pretty catchy.
Emily Fields, you surprise me.
How?
Would you really consider staying here to take that job?
I don't know.
Maybe, I guess.
Got it.
Yeah?
The Dr. Cochran that Noel was calling
I checked over a copy of the Mary Drake file
and I found a mention of a doctor with the same name
that practices in Brookhaven.
Spence, that file's more than 20 years old.
What are the odds of us finding any real information now?
They're better than the odds of us getting anything accomplished
if we stick around here. Let's go.
Okay.
So how was your first day of school?
Usual pranks.
At least you've already been teaching there.
It's not like it was your first time back.
Like, deciding to take a job out of the blue or something.
Okay, how about we skip the part
where I try and figure out what's going on
and you just tell me.
I'm thinking about applying for a coaching job
at the high school, and I was wondering
how you'd feel about me being there with you?
I'm fine with it.
Really?
Yeah, in fact I'd love it.
Why? What? Did you want me to say that I didn't want you to?
No, no, not at all. I..
I don't know. I'm-I'm not, I'm not even sure I wanna do it.
It doesn't hurt to apply.
No, you're right.
Five years ago, who would have thought
we'd both end up back at RHS?
It's Aria.
"Doesn't seem like the best night to spend at Ezra's.
Mind if I bunk with you at Lucas' loft?"
Em, what Aria did with Ezra's phone, it's not your fault.
No, I'm not so sure.
Even if I did get her into this mess
maybe there's a way I can get her out.
Hello.
Hi.
Um, we're here to see Dr. Cochran.
We're the ones who called earlier.
How can I help you?
Oh, I'm...sorry, we were looking for a Dr. Cochran
who would have worked at this address about 20 or so years ago.
That would've been my father.
Did he used to practice here?
He did. He was an OB/GYN.
He lost his license years ago.
Look, I really have to get back to work.
I'm so sorry, doctor, please.
Is there any way that we can get in touch with your father?
We just need to ask him a couple of questions.
Look, I don't know where my father is.
I haven't spoken to him in years.
You two seem nice enough.
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Well, yeah, kind of.
Oh, no. Uh, sorry, no. Not that kind of trouble.
No.
Well, then take my advice.
Wherever my father is, it's where he belongs.
Don't go looking for him.
Emily, I appreciate you coming. I really do.
And I believe you when you say
that it was your idea to delete the call--
Good, thank you.
But that doesn't change the fact that she still did it.
Can you blame her?
Uh, yeah. A little.
She was scared.
Of Nicole coming back?
Of losing you.
Look, Ezra, I know what you're going through.
Do you?
Okay. Okay, I don't know, but I can imagine.
And possibility of Nicole being alive
it seems like it changes everything.
But don't let it change everything.
Like?
Like the fact that you and Aria love each other.
That you proposed to her less than a week ago.
I hear you. I really do.
I-I really need to think this through.
And I, quite frankly, haven't had time to even...
I'm sorry, I need to take this.
Hello.
Uh, yeah, this is he.
Really?
Uh, how many hours till they reach the camp?
No, no, no, please no!
Goodness, Hanna.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Mrs. Grunwald, what are you doing here?
Are you alone, my dear?
Yeah, Aria and Emily are out, but...
I mean, are you alone?
Caleb and I are...
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna be rude, but what are you doing here?
I had a dream.
What happened in it?
I've never considered the content of dreams to be important.
It's the impressions they leave that affect me.
Impressions?
Well, in this case the dream left me quite unsettled.
The sense was strong enough that I felt compelled to come here.
The sense of what?
A darkness
around you and Caleb.
Are the two of you alright?
This is Spencer Hastings.
This is Dr. Cochran, remember me?
Yeah, of course.
I'm the person whose office you had someone ransack last night.
Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about--
Stop it, alright.
You and your little friend came to see me
and I didn't give you what you wanted
so you sent someone back here to break in and find it for you.
But he didn't find it, did he?
No.
Well, guess what?
I can't afford to have your guy come back here again
so get a pen.
A pen?
Write down this address.
Oh, yeah, okay. Okay.
Okay.
431 Evangeline Highway.
It's an apartment complex outside of town.
It's a real pit.
You should feel right at home.
And what's at this address?
My father.
At least he was the last time the police called me about him.
And here's a hint. You want him to talk
you better bring a bottle of whisky.
Whisky. Got it.
So there. I gave you what you wanted.
Now please, call off your dogs and don't bother me again.
I-I promise I wouldn't..
看来诺埃尔·卡恩刚刚帮了我们
Caleb and I..
we're definitely not alright.
None of us are.
Someone's been trying to hurt us.
Do you know who that someone is?
I think so.
But the others aren't quite so sure.
By any chance, does that person
have a connection with this hotel?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's staying here.
He attacked Alison, he kidnapped me
and someone just died in this hotel.
Many people died here, Hanna,
before it became a hotel.
Their pain
radiates through these walls.
Their cries of anguish
still echo.
Do you hear them?
No.
You're lucky.
It's deafening.
In "Winter's Tale," we're prompted to consider
what happens to someone when those around them
incorrectly conclude that they are immoral unworthy
or outright liars.
So what happens to someone's character
when they're wrongfully accused?
Well, Queen Hermione, she wasn't without fault
but she suffered for a sin she didn't commit.
So why would her husband, or anyone else
for that matter, put her through that?
What did Shakespeare observe in human nature
that rings true today?
That some people like to troll other people.
I'd like to think that the Bard had something deeper in mind.
But that's what's going on in the story, isn't it?
No. Not really.
The King's ragging on his wife because she slept around on him.
But she didn't. That's the point.
Whatever.
If you're the King or the Queen and people look up to you,
you can say or do whatever you want
and get away with it.
Until your lies catch up to you.
Yeah, well, you'd know.
Miss DiLaurentis, please report to the principal's office.
Miss DiLaurentis, please report to the principal's office.
I apologize if my coming here disturbed you.
You say you feel this darkness around us.
I wanted to warn you that you are in danger,
but I see that you already know that.
But from who?
All I know
is that the source of the threat
against you is close.
Very close.
Hello, Hanna.
Take any country drives lately?
No!
Please let me get out of here.
No! No, please!
Freaks.
Sounds good. Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Please, sit.
So how are you doing being back here at school?
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm doing great. Thanks. I'm glad to be back.
I heard about the shenanigans in your class yesterday.
I'm so sorry that the students put you through that.
It amazes me how cruel teenagers can be sometimes.
Must have been extremely unsettling.
Nothing I can't handle.
Be that as it may, I...
I feel the need to ask you if you're absolutely sure
that you made the right choice in returning so quickly.
I am.
Alison, Mrs... Miss...
DiLaurentis.
Even the strongest person would hesitate
to rush back into things so quickly
after enduring what you've been through.
I'm not here to judge, I'm here to support
whatever decision that you make.
But, I want you to be sure
that you know there's no shame
in taking all the time necessary to heal.
Excuse me, Principal Hackett.
But the crew counselor needs the students' file
for a last-minute letter of recommendation.
Go ahead.
So as I was saying...
I made the right decision coming back here.
I think this place will provide just what I need
to speed my recovery.
Hackett.
Splendid.
Thank you.
Okay. Hanna, we're all here. What's the emergency?
I had a nightmare that Caleb was run over by a car.
But he's okay.
And then Grunwald showed up and told me he's not okay.
And then Noel Kahn showed up
and made Grunwald's head explode.
To be fair, that does sound like an emergency.
Okay, can you go over that again more slowly?
And what exactly are you saying?
That Noel Kahn is A.D.
You guys, I told you last night.
He stole Mary Drake's file,
he hurt Yvonne, he called Dr. Cochran--
Wait, we weren't even together last night.
No, we were in my dream. Catch up.
You guys, he burned us out of the storm cellar
and he wrote on that window.
He probably killed Sara
and we know he's bad because way back
when he pushed that sorority girl down the stairs.
Hanna, what about Sara telling me
we're looking for the same thing you are?
I mean, she and Jenna were working with Noel.
To find Charlotte's killer.
And that still leaves room for Noel Kahn to be A.D.
And what about the storm cellar?
He's the only one who'd write "I see you."
Maybe.
No, you guys
What about Caleb?
How's he doing on breaking
the code in the files?
Not good. But what does that matter anyways?
You guys are never gonna realize
that Noel is the one behind everything.
Never say never.
Oh, thanks, Pam.
What else is there to look into?
Nothing. We're at a dead end.
No. Not exactly.
Aria and I have a doctor's appointment to go to.
Dr. Cochran?
What's it to you?
Uh, we were hoping that we could ask you
a few questions about your time at Radley..
and a patient named Mary Drake.
I don't often get a visit
from such a pretty couple of girls.
I'm shocked.
I mean, uh..
every couple of months maybe
if I save enough from social security
call one of those escort services--
Curb the perv or the bottle walks.
It's been a long time since I thought about Mary Drake.
She was a pretty one.
What else can you tell us about her?
She lacked common sense and discrimination.
That seems pretty sure.
How so?
Back in the day, I was the on-call doctor
at Radley, the, uh, sanitarium
not the wine and cheese bar that they turned it into.
Let me tell you.
It kept me pretty busy.
Patients weren't treated very well
and that created
problems.
My job was to make the problems go away.
Problems like babies.
Babies that were born
and that someone wanted to not be born.
So, Mary
Oh, yeah, I dealt with two of her babies.
First one was a C-section, right?
A boy.
I gave him to Mary's sister, Jessica.
Charlotte.
What's that?
You want me to tell the story or not?
Okay.
Several years later
damned if Mary didn't get into trouble again.
That baby was a fighter.
Underweight but tenacious.
I don't remember if it was a boy or a girl.
As was the custom then
it was put into temporary custody
of County Family Services.
So what happened to the child after that?
Not my problem. At least it wasn't then.
Meaning?
Society changed.
Rules happened.
Eventually, my ability to solve problems became a liability
and Radley let me go.
Soon after that, I lost my license.
And Mary Drake?
Haven't heard her name since then
till you showed up.
Keep buying me whisky and
and I'll come up with something else to talk about.
Thank you.
If you see my daughter again
tell her something for me, will you?
Sure.
Tell her that she can run from me
and our history all she wants.
She can even pretend she's someone completely different.
But in the end
she's gonna want that family more than anything.
You can't deny human nature.
You always return to family in the end.
Well, two days in a row. To what do I owe this pleasure?
I, uh, thought I'd apply for the coaching position.
What a coincidence.
I was just, uh, interviewing another candidate.
Actually, I believe you two were classmates.
Paige.
Thank you.
So were you surprised to see me at school today?
Yeah. A little.
A lot.
Good surprised or bad surprised?
Good. Yeah.
How long has it been? Two years?
Nearly three.
When we were living together at Stanford
that little place in College Terrace.
It's where my dad died.
It was a tough time.
I was a mess.
That's all I could think about.
I was the reason we broke up.
Hey, as good as things were between us when they were right
there's no guarantee it would have lasted.
Something else could've just as easily come up.
Yeah? Like what?
Come on, I just took the hit
for a whole relationship crashing.
I had my own rough patch.
I was pretty focused on making it to the Olympics.
I remember.
Well, then I had a little car accident.
Tore up my knee pretty badly.
It heeled maybe 90% back to where it was.
That last 10%
that was gonna be the Olympics.
Now it's gone for good.
I'm so sorry.
Well, we both ran into some bumps in the road.
Me, literally.
But here we are better than ever.
So why are you bothering with Rosewood High?
I mean, I'm sure there's plenty of D1 colleges
that would love to have you on their staff.
Yeah, I have a couple applications in
but when this job came up, I figured what the hell?
Yeah. Me, me too.
May the best woman win.
Yeah.
Cheers.
I think we're gonna need more wine.
I agree.
After years of searching and unresolved questions
a joint operation between local police
and Colombian government forces
has been able to successfully locate the site
of a previously secret rebel camp.
This camp has long been suspected
of holding foreign aid workers hostage.
Some for years.
There's been no comment from the Colombian government
regarding whether or not the hostages are still alive.
But they promised to release the latest as they have it
and to establish a hotline for loved ones to reach.
God, it's incredible. The news.
Yeah. It's kind of killing me not knowing.
You should go.
In fact..
I got you a ticket.
The flight leaves tomorrow morning.
I'll take you to the airport.
You..
you didn't have to do this.
Yeah. I did.
I've cashed in our tickets to Italy.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Well, hopefully..
once you get there, you will.
Do you think Noel wrote it?
I don't know what to think anymore.
Well, whoever A.D. is
they're still one step ahead of us.
Uh, not necessarily. You got to the doctors first.
Yeah, and I'll let you know how helpful that was
after I look into every county childcare employee from the 90s.
Well, maybe it's time we go to the police
and just say it's Noel.
你们真的想死吗
And Toby hasn't left yet
and that Detective Furey seems reasonable--
What happens if we're wrong?
A.D. fries us. That's what happens.
Exactly.
Stop!
No, no, no, no, no!
Please, don't do it! Please don't!
Hanna?
The deal's on.
I get you the money, you give me the keys.
Tonight.
And then you forget you ever heard from me.
My name, the location,
this number, all of it.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Good.
The less you know about this, the better.
Um, I'm just stopping by to tell you that I'm gonna be
off the grid for a couple of days.
Why? What's going on?
I'm going to New York.
I have to do some legwork for the design business
Lucas and I are building.
Do you want me to go with you?
No. Thanks.
I mean, it's no trouble. This room's getting kind of old--
Caleb, I'll be fine.
Okay.
Where you gonna stay?
I don't know yet.
Anyways, uh, I gotta go.
Well, have a safe trip, I guess.
Please do not leave your baggage
or any other items unattended.
All items will be confiscated...
Aria.
Go.
So did you learn anything else about the job?
It's not bad...
