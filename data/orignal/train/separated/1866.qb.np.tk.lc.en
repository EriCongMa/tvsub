you work ,
you study , you prepare ...
months and years leading to one day ...
the day when you step up .
okay , let &apos;s get started .
yeah , let &apos;s do it .
got a lot of standing around to do today .
he &apos;s right , people .
starting today , fifth @-@ year residents
rotate in as lead surgeons .
we &apos;ve alerted the morgue .
on that day , you have to be ready for anything .
attendings , you will observe and stay silent .
offer help only when you absolutely have to .
yeah , before you help them swim ,
let &apos;em sink a little .
but there &apos;s one thing you can never quite prepare for ...
the next order of business--
effective 9 : 00 a.m. this morning ,
i have resigned as chief of surgery
of seattle grace mercy west hospital .
i will stay on the surgical staff .
i will turn this meeting over to the new chief of surgery ,
dr. owen hunt .
the day when you step down .

hey , you heard about zola ?
i haven &apos;t heard anything .
and she &apos;s clipping her first aneurysm .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to start with something simpler ?
yeah , like juggling chain saws ?
oh , thanks . that &apos;s helping .
hey , is it up yet ?
is it up yet ?
it &apos;s going up now .
hey , you heard anything ?
haven &apos;t heard anything .
how are you even here ?
well , there &apos;s nothing i can do , and i have to do something ,
so i might as well do this .
it &apos;s up .
o.r. 3 . yes !
i love o.r. 3 .
wait . bowel resection ? i thought you had a peds case .
i switched last minute .
you can &apos;t just switch .
oh , plastics . i thought you were the gunther .
wasting all your capital on boob jobs , huh ?
it &apos;s a cleft lip .
i &apos;m changing a kid &apos;s life today .
look at kepner , she &apos;s fixing a bum knee .
way to shoot for the stars , kid .
okay , guys .
uh , you also start teaching skills labs today .
i made up a schedule for the month .
it &apos;s up on the board in my office .
in your what ?
when did we get this ?
uh , we didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s for the chief resident , actually .
this is good . i can sleep on this .
yeah , i got that on craigslist . it &apos;s--it &apos;s mine .
we got a fridge ?
okay , guys .
why is my name on this ?
these are this month &apos;s intern skills labs .
each of you has been given one skills lab to teach .
no , i can &apos;t teach today . i &apos;m on a mitral valve .
okay , well , then just switch with one of these guys .
aneurysm .
bowel resection .
i got a baby &apos;s face .
guys , come on . i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i divided these up fairly .
you come on . every surgery we do this year
could end up on the oral boards .
and they love picking the crappy outcomes .
this could affect which fellowship i get .
i mean , it &apos;s not just life or death , april .
now it &apos;s our careers .
okay , how &apos;s this ?
whoever has the worst outcome today
teaches all the skills labs for the whole month .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m in .
that &apos;s terrible .
you guys get this e @-@ mail ?
you know , that &apos;s disgusting .
no , no , no . there will be no wagering on patient outcomes .
that--that--that &apos;s an order .
so you &apos;re out , then ?
you know , okay , just-- everyone out of my office .
webber resigned .
he &apos;s no longer chief of surgery .
dr. owen hunt is now chief of surgery .
what ?
that the alzheimer &apos;s trial ?
heard from the f.d.a. ?
i &apos;m sending it to phoenix .
carl baumann is taking over . i &apos;m blacklisted .
i may never do another clinical trial ever again .
yeah , i &apos;ve been blacklisted , too .
and now you &apos;re gonna let them fire you ?
i fired myself .
it &apos;s one thing , taking the blame for meredith
and losing the trial , but ...
why are you doing this to yourself ?
you know , i came to ask if you heard anything about your little girl ?
no , i have not .
this isn &apos;t right .
hope you hear soon .
how does he not tell me he &apos;s chief of surgery ?
well , is it because you--
didn &apos;t have his baby ?
i mean , has he said anything ?
no . we haven &apos;t talked about it .
at all ?
is that bad ? that &apos;s bad , right ?
well , i mean , it &apos;s just--
i @-@ is it true ?
uh ... yeah .
oh , my god . when did--
well , uh , webber talked to me last night , but--
i was gonna tell you , but you were already asleep ,
and then this morning , you had already gone--
oh , yeah . um , m @-@ my mitral valve .
right . right .
right , sorry .
sorry . good luck .
no ! no . oh , god , you--
you , you &apos;re the ...
this is great . we should celebrate .
i guess so , yeah .
um ... dinner ?
oh , my surgery .
mitral valve takes , like , a minimum of seven hours .
oh . sometime .
okay ?
i gotta ...
oh , congratulations .
thanks. yeah .
congratu--
congratulations .
yeah , that was bad .
hey . i need an intern to assist on my bowel resection .
well , everyone &apos;s booked , so good luck finding someone .
isn &apos;t that your job ?
no , my job is making the schedule that you screwed up .
ah , karev .
uh , i just saw that you turned down my 3 month old &apos;s
esophageal atresia surgery
for webber &apos;s , uh ...
i &apos;m--i &apos;m so sorry .
i was trying to say webber &apos;s bowel resection ,
but then i fell asleep .
i just thought i could use
more practice with bowel resections .
no , you &apos;re trying to pad your boards with good outcomes ,
so you went for the easy &quot; a. &quot;
you keep that up ,
and you &apos;re gonna lowball yourself out of the fellowship .
is that what you &apos;re doing ?
or is this about winning that stupid bet ?
just find me an intern .
karev , you ready for your surgery ?
uh , i think so , sir .
kepner &apos;s having a little trouble getting it staffed .
what &apos;s the problem ? i &apos;ve been treating sam kenton for years .
i don &apos;t want to have to postpone him .
uh , no , sir . no , sir . i will find someone to assist .
i &apos;ll get it covered ,
even if i have to do it myself .
well , great .
great .
so if rob &apos;s out of surgery ,
then i &apos;ll pick him up from school ,
but if not , then i &apos;ll text you ,
and you can drop him at kathy &apos;s .
yeah , thanks so much . okay , bye .
sorry , i just ...
have to make sure we got the kids squared away .
i totally understand .
you have kids ?
uh , let &apos;s get back to your surgery .
so i will locate the aneurysm ,
which is the bulge in the wall of your artery .
and then i will take a steel clip ,
which is like a tiny clothespin ,
and i &apos;m gonna place it across the neck of the aneurysm .
and that will stop the blood supply .
that way , we don &apos;t have to worry about a rupture .
how do you know if you fixed it ?
well , we do what we call a matador move .
i &apos;ll take a needle , and i poke the dome of the aneurysm .
and if we see a tiny amount of blood ,
then we know it was successful .
and if it wasn &apos;t successful , it bursts .
possibly .
and i die .
not if i get it clipped .
and what &apos;s your success rate ?
how many have you done ?
this will be my first .
i sort of wish you lied about that .
yeah , well , after today ,
her success rate will be 100 % .
dr. grey is the best we have ,
and i &apos;ll be there the whole time .
do you have any other questions ?
no .
no , thanks .
try and rest easy .
i &apos;ll see you after .
thank you for that .
have you heard anything from the social worker ?
no . have you ?
no .
i &apos;m worried , if we haven &apos;t heard back by now ,
that it &apos;s not gonna go our way .
well , i &apos;ll call again .
no , don &apos;t . we &apos;ve called too much .
derek .
yes .
what if we don &apos;t get zola back ?
i mean , what happens to us ?
what do you want to do ? do you want to stay together ?
we have a surgery .
let &apos;s just focus on that .
you .
ruth bennet , 50,
mitral valve replacement patient ,
complained overnight of stomach pains .
these stomach pains , what did you do ?
you .
we tested her cardiac enzymes , ran an echo .
both were normal .
did anyone touch her stomach ?
no one touched the patient ?
are you guys the slow class ?
palpating the patient &apos;s abdomen is first ,
before tests or labs .
basics , people . fundamentals .
i &apos;m all about not skipping steps .
oh , sorry .
does it hurt more or less when i take my hand away ?
m @-@ more .
see ? basics .
you should be doing this in your sleep .
take , uh , mrs. bennet for a triple @-@ contrast c.t.
try not to get lost .
he just seems so little .
i mean , i thought it could wait .
i understand , but i assure you that now
is the right time .
by fixing those muscles early ,
his maxilla , his whole upper jaw ,
will have a real shot at forming properly .
but he &apos;ll have a scar ?
well , i &apos;m gonna do what &apos;s called a straight @-@ line repair .
so that &apos;ll leave a little scar ,
which i &apos;ll hide right in the contour of his lip right here .
and then over time , it &apos;ll fade altogether .
shouldn &apos;t even be noticeable .
then he &apos;ll look even more handsome
than he does right now , if that &apos;s possible .
he is a pretty handsome guy , isn &apos;t he ?
he certainly is . yes , you are .
you want to wait here with your mama
while i go get you all set up ?
i &apos;ll come back this afternoon , all right , buddy ?
thank you , dr. avery .
my pleasure .
he &apos;ll do great .
excellent .
you couldn &apos;t have been clearer .
you answered her questions .
you eased her fears .
thanks . that &apos;s , um--
mark sloan &apos;s gonna do the surgery , though .
how &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s not you . you &apos;re great . you &apos;re the gunther .
but you &apos;re planning a straight @-@ line repair ,
and i &apos;d rather the kid get a millard rotation
so that we don &apos;t risk the lip shortening over time .
but i was actually--
for the kid &apos;s sake ,
i @-@ i gotta have sloan do it .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s an artist .
dr. robbins , uh ,
it &apos;s my procedure .
i &apos;m sorry , avery .
just not this time .
uh , this is sam kenton , 55 .
he &apos;s here for a bowel resection
due to chronic mesenteric ischemia .
this is sam &apos;s third surgery with us .
third time &apos;s the charm .
and this is sam &apos;s son jason .
jason should be in school
instead of here , playing nursemaid .
it &apos;s one semester . think how much money i &apos;m saving you .
well , i &apos;m worried , you &apos;re not getting any smarter .
kid &apos;s not very smart .
wonder where i get that from .
did he just call me stupid ?
i think he did .
sam &apos;s been dr. webber &apos;s patient
since--
kepner , just give me the bullet , okay ?
sam kenton , 55,
presents with chronic mesenteric ischemia .
um , nonresponsive to revascularization .
scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy
and possible bowel resection .
oh , it &apos;s so sad .
i mean , how many years was he chief for ?
11 .
i mean , are we supposed to all pretend
we don &apos;t know what really happened ?
oh , why did he cover for her ?
i mean , what &apos;s his deal with her ?
hey . hi .
good morning , ladies .
uh , uh , so what &apos;s the system here ?
does everybody have a spot or--
oh , anywhere is fine .
oh , all right , then .
right ... here .
and i will see you this afternoon .
you all have an excellent day .
you , too .
already am .
i mean , he &apos;s trying so hard .
he talked to his sandwich .
well , what are--
uh , dr.-- uh , sorry . chief .
um , larry jennings sent you this bottle of scotch
to say congratulations .
oh . thanks . just , uh , put it somewhere .
okay . uh , and , dr. torres ,
i need to push my meniscus repair to tomorrow .
i have to teach a skills lab .
a skills lab over a surgery ?
yeah , and then i have to assist karev ...
on a bowel resection .
you should be delegating that stuff .
i tried , but no one would cover it .
don &apos;t try , kepner . just order them .
leadership isn &apos;t about making friends .
oh , well , then i &apos;m doing it right .
that was nice . very chief @-@ y .
dr. hunt .
may i have my call schedule , please ?
sorry ?
my call schedule ,
which i usually get at the staff meeting , but i didn &apos;t ,
because you said you would distribute them ,
but you haven &apos;t . so i had to come find you ,
and you &apos;re not very easy to find ,
not unlike my call schedule .
so may i have my call schedule , please ?
just--of course .
i--just as soon as--
thank you .
that was way less chief @-@ y there .
okay . what did i do ?
oh , nothing . nothing .
she was webber &apos;s right @-@ hand man .
she &apos;d hate anyone in your position .
yeah ,
i know it &apos;s not about making friends ,
but you really want bailey as your enemy ?
i was right .
ruth bennet &apos;s scans show appendicitis .
the morons missed it .
i &apos;m turfing her to general surgery for an appendectomy .
why don &apos;t you do the appy ?
where do i start ?
because it &apos;s general surgery , and i &apos;m on cardio .
because it &apos;s first @-@ year surgery ,
and i &apos;m a fifth year .
because--
you know what , this is great .
i mean , ruth has a heart condition ,
and we have to monitor her anyway .
and because of her c.o.p.d. ,
she has to have an open appy ,
and we don &apos;t want some moron doing it .
and you get a procedure .
thank you .
it &apos;s a very basic procedure .
but you love the basics .
and you &apos;re all about the fundamentals .
can i ask you something ,
um , just about his recovery ,
specifically the , like , bathroom part ?
will i need to be in there with him ?
&apos;cause my mom was here for his other surgeries , and--
right .
i &apos;ll do it . i &apos;ll totally do whatever he needs .
i just want to be prepared , you know , &apos; cause ...
he &apos;ll be embarrassed and i &apos;ll ...
well , neither of us is gonna like it .
yeah , there , um ,
there are a couple of possible outcomes .
and it all just sort of depends on
what dr. karev finds during surgery .
so i &apos;ll just-- i &apos;ll have him come
and--and talk you through them , okay ?
is that guy cool ?
he seems a little ... douchey .
he &apos;s good , very good .
he can be a little douchey ...
but he &apos;s a good guy ,
and a very good surgeon .
thanks .
meredith , uh ...
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i never meant for any of this to--
i know what you wanted to do for me .
but--
i do .
i saw you were clipping your first aneurysm .
wanted to say good luck .
i am trying to figure out what clip to use .
well , you can &apos;t ,
not until you see it .
every aneurysm is different ,
a different approach .
you &apos;ll know what to do once you get in there .
it &apos;s a big deal--
a resident &apos;s first aneurysm clip .
derek &apos;s leads the whole o.r. in a round of applause .
i ...
don &apos;t know that he &apos;ll do that today , but ...
you two all right ?
i , uh , i only ask ,
because if you can &apos;t communicate with your attending ,
you have no business being in that o.r. ,
no matter how prepared you are .
we &apos;re okay .
we &apos;re fine .
all right .
i need your pig .
i have to remember how to do an open appendectomy .
no . does a pig even have an appendix ?
uh , let &apos;s find out .
who wants an aneurysm ?
i &apos;m about to have one .
i have to do an appy .
on a pig ? does a pig even have one ?
on a person .
i haven &apos;t thought about one in ...
three years .
oh , well , come on . who wants to trade ?
i &apos;ll do anything .
unh @-@ unh . clipping those things is like defusing a bomb .
one wrong move , and it explodes .
well , i &apos;m worried about derek exploding .
can i have your pig ?
no .
how about just the head , huh ?
want to clip an aneurysm ?
good luck , macgyver .
主人公善于用简单工具解决问题
oh , there you are . alex--
does a pig have an appendix ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought you were teaching my skills lab .
i am . i just left them to practice whipstitches .
alex--
stop . turn out the lights . close the door .
check this out .
injected fluorescein dye--
makes any viable part of the bowel glow .
nice .
yeah , in high school ,
成立于1981年洛杉矶
i had a metallica poster just like this .
you might win the bet .
yeah , with a color @-@ coded colon .
no kidding .
i have a bomb to defuse .
this is crazy .
i gotta find a book or a skills l--
oh , skills lab .
i gotta get some instruments .
i &apos;m just gonna use the head , all right ?
will you talk to jason kenton ?
he has some questions--
i &apos;m busy .
turning a pig into a lava lamp ?
my patient--
it &apos;s not my job . you talk to him .
show of hands--
who knows the steps of an open appendectomy ?
dr. bailey , your call schedule .
sorry it was so ,
so , bailey , i know you &apos;ve taken over
dr. webber &apos;s islet cell trial .
mm @-@ hmm .
and i wanted to
offer you some protected time for your research .
i can reduce your o.r. schedule .
lighten your teaching load .
make sure you get that time that you need .
how does that sound ?
you telling me i don &apos;t manage my time well ?
no . no . no , no , no .
i @-@ i just wanted to make sure that your research
got the time--
oh , you &apos;re telling me how to use my time ?
n @-@ not at all . i wouldn &apos;t .
i just--i &apos;m sorry . just forget i mentioned it .
oh , now i don &apos;t get the time ?
no , you do . you do . you can--
you--you can-- just do what--
nah , unh @-@ unh .
no , leave it up . leave it up .
i &apos;ll just do the meniscus repair myself .
great .
and now i lose a procedure .
this is worse than being an intern .
yeah , being chief resident sucks .
i did it once .
well , how &apos;d you do it ?
how &apos;d you get them to listen to you ?
uh , i didn &apos;t . i sucked .
look , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not about making friends ,
but it is about getting them on your side .
you want to be the person they come to ,
not the one they run from .
you know , kinda like your little contest .
you know , getting them to compete for good outcomes .
i know . it &apos;s awful , right ?
no , that was a good idea . they thrive on competition .
you gave them what they needed .
and either way , the patient wins .
that ... was a good idea .
okay .
that wasn &apos;t your idea , was it ?
no .
well ... don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ll be great .
or maybe you won &apos;t .
i never was .
it &apos;s perfect .
it &apos;s a perfect millard rotation ...
on a pig .
this pig ... is now more attractive than your average pig .
i deserve to do it .
i &apos;m ready . i can do it .
i deserve it .
you &apos;re right .
you go , gunther .
next step ?
you .
lift up peritoneum , open transversely ,
and enlarge the incision .
enlarge how ?
with sc--with scissors ?
are you asking me or telling me ?
with scissors .
okay . okay , good .
then what ?
you .
pull out and isolate the appendix ...
mm @-@ hmm . cross @-@ clamp it at the base , and ...
and go on .
i can &apos;t remember .
unacceptable .
god . you should know this .
cross @-@ clamp the appendix at the base--
yeah , you already did that . okay ? hurry up .
he &apos;s dying now .
tie off or li-- wait . ligate--
hurry . you &apos;re losing him .
wait .
wait . hang on .
wait .
wait .
call the morgue , moron . he &apos;s dead .
okay , who &apos;s next ?
you .
open transversely ,
enlarge with scissors ,
insert retractors ,
deliver appendix ,
cross @-@ clamp at the base .
hey , so ... you going in for your mitral valve ?
oh , my mitral valve turned into an appy .
oh , right . well ...
good luck .
oh , so ...
does that mean you &apos;ll be home tonight ?
i mean , an appy &apos;s what ,
two hours , tops , right ?
right .
oh , that--that is true .
oh , do you want me to pick something up ?
or i can . chinese ?
oh , fine . wh @-@ whatever .
no , no , you choose .
do chinese . chinese is great .
good . right .
well ... good luck .
and you , too , grey .
you have to talk about it
because clearly , you can &apos;t talk about anything .
you two are like bad roommates .
how ? how do i bring it up ?
i mean , does he even want me to bring it up ?
and what--and what is there to talk about ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s done .
i can &apos;t undo it . it &apos;s--it &apos;s done .
yeah , but it &apos;s not .
oh , we have surgery .
don &apos;t screw it up .
ah , you , too .
did you know sam &apos;s wife took care of him after his last two surgeries ?
she died of a stroke last year ,
so jason dropped out of college one semester before graduating .
he was happy to do it &apos; cause it &apos;s just the two of them--
what the hell , kepner ? why are you telling me this ?
talking to patients is your job , alex ,
because they &apos;re more than just ...
an easy &quot; a &quot; or some bet you can win .
it &apos;s your job .
no , it &apos;s not . not anymore .
my job is to open him up and fix him ,
and if i can &apos;t do it , no one &apos;s gonna do it for me .
it &apos;s on me .
so i can spend time talking to him
or i can use that time figuring out what i &apos;m gonna do
when i open him up .
which one do you want me to do ?
you &apos;re really nervous .
that &apos;s why you didn &apos;t want to work on a kid today .
look , you &apos;ll be fine .
you &apos;re ready .
i mean , you feel ready , right ?
i am thoroughly enjoying this book , karev .
that &apos;s great .
hopefully , i &apos;ll finish it in there ,
because as long as i &apos;m reading ,
it means that you &apos;re not screwing up .
will i finish this book today ?
yes , sir .
all right .
have you got the pre @-@ op scans ?
i already looked them over .
i want to look again .
i think you should do the surgery .
why ?
because we &apos;re not a team right now .
what happens if the aneurysm ruptures ?
put a temporary clip on the feeding artery .
and if the aneurysm still bleeds ?
i gain control of the common carotid in the neck .
what kind of clip are you gonna go with ?
i won &apos;t know till i get in there .
you &apos;re ready . let &apos;s go .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re the lead surgeon .
you &apos;re on that side .
you practiced it the other way , didn &apos;t you ?
is there a problem ?
no , sir .
10 @-@ blade .
what are you doing now ?
are we still doing the thing where i have to tell you every little move
never gets old .
what are you doing now ?
blunt separation of the oblique muscles .
neat .
you know , you-- you have a kid
and you--you worry a lot about screwing them up .
like something that you do or say
or something you don &apos;t say will change them forever .
yes , ma &apos;am .
i was just thinking that you &apos;re totally determining
the course of this kid &apos;s life .
you will determine whether or not
this kid gets made fun of for his looks ,
or if he cries at his school picture every year .
and today you will decide
who he goes to the prom with ,
and who he will marry
or if--i mean , if he gets married at all ,
or if he dies alone ,
unattractive and unloved .
did you want me to call sloan ?
okay , i &apos;ve isolated the aneurysm .
i can see the whole neck .
what is that ?
it &apos;s an angled 7 millimeter .
i &apos;d go smaller , use a straight one .
no .
no ?
you only get one shot at this .
use a smaller clip .
i may need the extra length .
you could hit one of the perforators .
not if i look where i &apos;m going .
put the clip down .
what are you doing now ?
i am isolating the appendix .
and now ?
i am cross @-@ clamping the appendix at the base .
and what are you doing now ?
okay , you can get as pissed as you want ,
but there is a reason that i &apos;m having you do all this .
i want to--
shh .
i beg your pardon ?
i don &apos;t--i @-@ i ...
i can &apos;t remember what comes next .
anastomosis is holding .
nice work .
okay . we gotta run the bowel .
make sure there isn &apos;t any ...
okay , crap .
okay .
cautery .
lift up peritoneum , open transversely .
all right , this is what i am talking about .
enlarge with scissors ...
why would i have you replace
a mitral valve ...
when you can &apos;t even remember a--
i can if you just please shut up .
i can &apos;t tell if any of this is viable .
well , what about here ? i mean , this looks--
no , it &apos;s crap .
is the fluorescein in ? have we started the dye ?
starting now .
it &apos;s in .
lights . now . kill the lights .
use the 5 millimeter .
i &apos;m looking right at it , derek .
you have to trust me .

can i have the needle and the penfield retractor ?
i &apos;ve got the suction .

holding perfectly .
okay , suction , please .
come on .
come on . give me something .
alex , there &apos;s not enough .
shut up .
lights .
i can &apos;t remember the next step .
well , you might remember this the next time
you &apos;re screaming at an intern for skipping the fundamentals .
will you just do it , please ?
take your time .
it &apos;ll come back .
no , it won &apos;t . honestly . i can stand here all day .
it &apos;s not gonna ...
oh , my god . you don &apos;t know , either .
oh , don &apos;t try to make this about me .
okay , then tell me what to do .
you should know what to do .
so should you .
well , it &apos;s been even longer
since i &apos;ve done one .
well , i need your help .
we need to be helping her right now .
you probably want to ligate at the proximal edge ,
apply a straight clamp ,
and lay down a purse @-@ string suture at the base .
right .
of course . thank you . i got it .
i got it .
no shame .
no shame at all .
you &apos;re still the goober .
it &apos;s gunther .
sure .
uh , i can &apos;t ...
if i close him , i &apos;m leaving him to die .
he &apos;ll die of sepsis .
can i revascularize ?
i can-- i can find the clot ,
i can do a transverse arteriotomy
and bypass the vessels .
no . there &apos;s , uh ...
there &apos;s way too much dead bowel .
do i pull it ?
i mean ... do i pull it all ?
put him on a transplant list ?
hope for ...
what do i do ?
do i close him and let him go ?
let &apos;s close .
thank you . thank you so much .
that &apos;s ...
fine .
can we make a deal ?
let us never speak of this .
deal .
night .
do you want me to talk to him ?
no .
you did everything you could .
you really did .
he won &apos;t be able to understand that ,
but i do .
and you should , too .
i don &apos;t want to go home .
i don &apos;t , either .
do we really have to talk about it ?
yes , you do .
maybe i &apos;ll come over later .
oh , that would be great .
no , actually , that would be bad ,
because that would mean my marriage is over .
here you go .
did you finish your shift ?
all right . so who lost the bet ?
not me . my bomb was defused perfectly .
my appy was flawless .
except it was finished by a nurse .
who told you that ?
karev &apos;s guy didn &apos;t even wake up . septic shock .
oh , you blew a bowel resection ?
that &apos;s like misspelling your own name .
hey , guys .
no , it &apos;s karev .
sorry , dude . enjoy that skills lab .
can i just point out that
jackson never even touched his patient ?
sloan did the whole procedure .
what does &quot; between you and me &quot; mean ?
so it would seem to me that he loses by forfeit .
loser .
forfeit .
i don &apos;t think that that &apos;s ...
you want a rematch ?
we could go again tomorrow .
and the next day .
and the next day .
nurse &apos;s station .
uh , dr. bailey . hold up , please .
uh ... okay .
i learned in the army that
a leader is only as good as the people around him .
now you are one of the best people on this team .
and ...
i just want to make sure that i ...
have you on my side .
have i done something wrong ?
no .
is there something in my job performance
that prompts you to ask me this ?
n ... no .
or do you just need me to like you ?
it &apos;s not that .
are you sure ?
c ... carry on , dr. bailey .
if you want to be mad at someone , be mad at me .
i &apos;m not mad at you .
yes , you are .
everyone knows who to be mad at .
the only thing meredith did to me
was to give my wife a little more time ,
and i &apos;m damn sure gonna spend it with her .
i &apos;m happy , bailey .
i &apos;d like you to be happy for me , too .
i &apos;ll try .
you &apos;re gonna have to give me a while .
i &apos;ll wait .
that was good .
you know , i &apos;ll get the dishes .
no , no , no , i &apos;ll do it .
no , no , i @-@ i &apos;ve got them .
you know , i &apos;ve been feeling , uh ...
terrible .
okay .
no , i mean it .
i know .
do you want to talk about it ?
did you have the spring rolls ?
we should never have been in that o.r. together today .
what do you mean ?
we &apos;re not a team , anywhere .
and when we get zola back ,
before we get that phone call ,
we need to figure out if we can be one ,
if we can even be together .
so now &apos;s the time to say how you feel .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m gonna say things that are ...
oh , derek , just say it .
whatever it is , we can deal with it .
i can accept the consequences .
meredith , you have never accepted a consequence
in your life .
since the moment you switched those files ,
you haven &apos;t suffered one bit .
that is not true .
while those around you have lost their jobs
and lost their reputations .
and i lost zola .
so did i !
because you do things ,
without a thought , you just dive in
and never give a damn how deep the water is
or who you &apos;re gonna land on .
i know i messed up , but all of this happened
before zola was even in the picture .
don &apos;t you think i &apos;ve changed ?
i don &apos;t think you can change . you stole the baby , meredith .
oh . i told you why i did that .
what do you need , for me to say i &apos;m sorry ?
i need you to be sorry .
of course i &apos;m sorry .
you did it again today in the o.r.
what ? i had a successful surgery today .
you refused to listen to me !
i didn &apos;t listen to you because i didn &apos;t need to listen to you .
i knew what i was doing and i was right .
you just couldn &apos;t trust me .
why should i ever trust you ?
why should i trust you ?
you ended my trial , you set back my career ,
you nearly ended your own , you destroyed richard &apos;s .
i have no reason to trust you .
well , then why are you with me ?
because of that .
because i meant that !
i promised i wouldn &apos;t run .
i promised i would love you .
even when you hate me .
even when i hate you .
i am trying , meredith .
i am trying , but you make it so damn hard .
i understand .
and i don &apos;t want you to keep the promise ,
not if you don &apos;t want to ,
and not if you can &apos;t trust me with our daughter .
i do . i trust you with zola .
well , you just said ...
that &apos;s not what i said .
i know that you took her to protect her .
i know that you altered the trial
for adele and for richard .
you stood in front of a bullet for me .
i know why you do all of it .
it &apos;s what i love about you .
and what you hate about me .
yeah .
so you can &apos;t trust me at work ?
no , i can &apos;t .
well , that &apos;s easy , then .
so we just don &apos;t work together .
so what are you saying ?
i &apos;m off your service . that &apos;s my consequence .
if we want to stay together ,
with or without zola , we just can &apos;t work together .
sometimes it happens in an instant .
we step up .
we become a leader . we see a path forward .
never again .
i told you not to order from that place .
their floors are disgusting .
yeah , but then you always say
you like their spring rolls .
don &apos;t ... don &apos;t say ...
don &apos;t say it .
thank you .
i &apos;m not gonna kiss you .
let &apos;s go to bed .
oh , no , no .
no , i @-@ i want to stay here .
come on . let &apos;s go to bed .
oh , no . it feels good here . it feels good here .
okay . come here .
there you go .
there you go .
we see a path , and we take it ...
