第五季 第十九集
j &apos;accuse , parikh ! cette soupe est trop chaude .
you just said , &quot; i accuse you , &quot;
and , &quot; the soup is too hot &quot; ?
indeed , it is .
i told you you could see your wedding dress
when i &apos;m finished with it .
hey , hey , guys , she &apos;s writing something .
okay . okay .
what &apos;s going on ?
yeah , but that was two months ago ,
and i need it by tomorrow night , because i have to decide
on my hair , on my jewelry ...
honey , honey , i am almost done with it .
so you got rid of the mirrors ?
definitely .
the battery pack ?
oh , yeah .
the little weird jacket that makes me look like
i &apos;m in a street gang from the future ?
all that crap &apos;s gone .
i &apos;ll have it to you by tomorrow night .
it &apos;s a guarantee .
okay .
i &apos;m screwed .
i can &apos;t believe i got to spend a whole day
without noodling you like this .
if anyone finds out we &apos;re together ,
they &apos;re not gonna let us be partners . so ...
before we figure out what this is ...
... just be normal , okay ?
no kissing , no touching ,
no doing that
sex bark you do .
i said not to do it .
and also no doing that song
you made up about squeezing me tight .
* gonna squeeze you tight *
* so wrong it &apos;s right *
* gonna fly the kite ... *
sorry , i know that &apos;s your thing .
i did not know she was here .
i did .
we have a situation .
i want to ask reagan to the wedding ,
so i @-@ i sent her a text to say ,
&quot; hey , how &apos;s your spring looking ? &quot;
that was an hour ago . no response .
dead . maybe she &apos;s dead .
yeah .
maybe @-@ maybe she doesn &apos;t miss me ,
or maybe she forgot me .
how could she forget me after i gave her my body ?
i thought you guys didn &apos;t have sex .
uh , outercourse .
it counts .
cece , i need you to send reagan a text
and if she responds ,
then we &apos;ll know that she &apos;s at least alive ...
and ignoring me .
no , i &apos;m not getting involved .
cece ...
... send the text .
that was terrifying .
wow , that voice is giving me gooseflesh .
mm , okay , fine , i &apos;ll do it .
thank you very much .
you &apos;re welcome ?
it &apos;s so easy , she &apos;s like a puppet .
i can hear you .
you know that , right ?
yeah .
just say thank you .
thank you .
get some sleep , kid .
you know what , jess ...
is this the dress ?
this can &apos;t be the ...
you told cece it was almost done .
i know ! i choked under the pressure .
i spent all last night trying to crack it .
nothing .
i can &apos;t make you beautiful
unless you let me in !
i &apos;ve never procrastinated like this .
well , what a fun , low @-@ stakes time to try new things .
i &apos;m freaking out . i &apos;ve been working on this for months .
it &apos;s just ...
it has to be perfect .
this dress is gonna be in every single picture ,
and people will say ,
&quot; cece , why do you look so bad ? &quot;
also , &quot; who is that murdered woman in the background ? &quot;
and the answer to both will be : jess .
this is true . i see this happening
exactly how you described it .
okay , could not sleep last night .
i &apos;m too excited about the dress .
i &apos;m ahead of schedule .
i &apos;ll have it to you this afternoon .
this afternoon ?
bye !
oh , my god .
ah ! why did i say that ?
there was no reason for me to say that .
i can &apos;t work like this . you have to get her out of here .
i can &apos;t take my idea walks .
your idea walks ?
how did you become such an important part of my life ?
when i craft ,
i like to get out of my space , bop around .
i use movement and scenery
to tickle the old idea box ,
but i can &apos;t do that now ,
&apos;cause every ten minutes cece comes in here , like ,
&quot; hey , jessica , that dress is gonna be gangbusters , polka dots . &quot;
that &apos;s a really good cece .
also a passable sinatra .
jess , what if i told you that there was a place ...
where you could work in peace .
schmidt , this is the men &apos;s room at your office .
oh , no , this is my wedding workshop .
see , i &apos;m the only guy in the building .
well , except , of course , for brian
but , you know , i pay brian eight dollars a day
to do his poops at the big box store across the street .
that seems high .
when do you do the work that you get paid for ?
rarely , and it &apos;s a problem , but ,
you know , we couldn &apos;t afford a planner , so , here we are .
please ...
have a seat at the think sink .
don &apos;t mind if i do .
i like its energy .
i will create a dress today .
if you need anything , just let me know . also ...
there &apos;s a fridge stocked
with sparkling water in stall three .
jess .
dang , girl , you ugly .
come on , mouse , how about we don &apos;t do this today .
bishop .
hmm ?
your fingers really that weak ?
how do you button your pants in the morning ?
honestly , sir ,
with , uh , great difficulty .
you guys should see bishop load his gun .
it &apos;s like watching a toddler eat peas .
fellas ,
come on , this is the lapd , right ?
we can &apos;t bring this city together
if we &apos;re tearing each other apart .
god , you &apos;re nice .
you &apos;re so nice , daniels .
thanks , buddy .
everybody smells fantastic , by the way .
thank you .
that &apos;s really nice , thanks , daniels .
very nice ; he is very nice .
you wanted to see me , kim ?
schmidt .
why did you copy me on all these e @-@ mails
you sent planning your wedding ?
what ?
darn it .
sorry about that .
um , kim is actually also the name of our chef &apos;s new assistant .
to your florist : &quot; beaming over the peony centerpieces .
no chance i &apos;ll get work done today . &quot;
to your dj :
&quot; fat wet beats ... &quot;
fwb .
... &quot; what about a swing theme &quot; for cocktail hour ?
i &apos;ll spend the day brainstorming tracks . out . &quot;
i &apos;m no longer with fat wet beats .
we had a few conversations
and he was being a straight @-@ up ho .
is this what you &apos;ve been doing
instead of the regional brand report ?
it was due three days ago .
that .
yes .
of course , i &apos;m gonna have that to you in ...
why are you sm ... why you smiling ... at me like that ?
i &apos;m imagining what it would be like to fire you .
the same feeling i had
when we unplugged my mother @-@ in @-@ law .
beep ... beep ... beep ...
is that legal ... in california ?
you &apos;ve been warned .
if i catch you doing anything at all
related to your wedding , you are out .
jess , jess , you gotta get out of here .
je @-@ jess .
oh , dear lord .
so , aly said that she wanted to keep things normal at work ...
okay .
... but then
she ripped me in front of everyone , dude .
isn &apos;t ripping you what aly does ?
yes , but we &apos;re a couple now , man .
i &apos;m flummoxed . what should i do ?
should i say something ?
no . don &apos;t communicate .
it &apos;s not gonna get you anywhere .
what you gotta do is you gotta follow her lead .
gotta play the game ,
like i &apos;m doing with reagan . i &apos;m play-- hey , cece ?
mm ? uh , did regan text you back yet ?
in the past three minutes , no .
son of a bi-- o @-@ okay , you know what ? plan b.
i &apos;m texting her from my burner .
hmm ? why do you have a burner phone ?
that &apos;s an insane question , dude .
that &apos;s not an answer .
a burner is crazy . look , if reagan had her phone ,
she would have texted me back .
she &apos;s probably on a plane or in a spa or ...
well , she just responded .
what ? !
i said , &quot; what are you doing for dinner ? &quot;
and she just texted back , &quot; who dis ? &quot;
so i &apos;m gonna text , &quot; who you think dis is ? &quot;
so now we play the waiting game .
&quot; karen ? &quot;
she thinks i &apos;m karen .
oh , yeah , i can be karen ...
and karen &apos;s gonna get some answers .
you know , as a cop , i find this
to be very disturbing .
but as a friend ...
man , this is straight @-@ up delicious .
sit much , dummy ?
look at her .
thank you .
she &apos;s so stupid .
what ?
what the hell was that ?
just being normal .
that was not normal .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i don &apos;t know how to act around you .
i can &apos;t kiss you .
i can &apos;t prank you .
i can &apos;t keep this bottled up .
winnie needs an outlet .
i know , i know we &apos;re incredibly sexual people .
that &apos;s right .
but if we try ...
we can keep our hands off of each other .
there is that hand i was looking for .
good job , officer .
hey , daniels .
hey . hey , guys .
tgi thursday , am i right ?
okay .
as you were .
that was close .
he saw us .
ooh , uh , p @-@ penelope .
have you seen a girl wandering around ?
um , look @-@ looks like a drawing of a best friend
that an eight @-@ year @-@ old would make .
jess .
oh , schmidt .
what ?
do you think this neckline is too risque ?
no secret , your girls got bombs .
she does , and normally , there &apos;s nothing i &apos;d rather talk about ,
but kim is on a rampage
and i forgot about this fakakta report that &apos;s due .
if she finds you here helping with the wedding ...
schmidt !
you walk on cat feet , you do .
who is this ?
who &apos;s who ?
this woman between us .
there &apos;s no one else i could be talking about .
there &apos;s so many women in this office .
who is this woman between us
sitting on the couch , schmidt ?
i &apos;m so lost .
her .
now i see her .
hi .
hi .
jess is ...
she &apos;s the new temp .
i &apos;m jess , the new temp .

i &apos;m gonna tell you right now , i don &apos;t want to hear about it .
she &apos;s mean .
temp ! come !
jess , this is a disaster .
we need to get you out of here
before kim actually puts my balls in the jar on her desk
&quot; for schmidt &apos;s balls . &quot;
we need an excuse so airtight
that she &apos;ll have to let you leave .
i got it .
my mother is in grave danger .
no , she &apos;s not .
pick up my kids .
all right , hurry up , you almost people !
little girl , come back !

these estrogen zombies would suck out my soul ,
but boy , did i love working here .
i loved every one of these malnourished ,
high @-@ strung sociopaths .
do you think you let the wedding planning get on top of you ?
how am i supposed to marry the most perfect woman in the world
if i can &apos;t give her the most perfect wedding ?
how am i supposed to give cece
a dress that &apos;s not as perfect as she is ?
you can &apos;t fire schmidt .
you-- give him his job back .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
