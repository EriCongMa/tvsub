company physical coming up , huh ?

i did it when i was in that alcohol @-@ induced coma .
&#91; 爱尔兰节日 &#93;
so , what &apos;s on the agenda ?
well , we &apos;re having brunch with my sisters .
you &apos;re hosting my preteen braves meeting .

out of litter we pick up .
you promised to help me write a haiku .

section 1 of article 21 of the state constitution
is amended to read : section 1 .

is taken under the direction of congress

the boundary lines of congressional ,
state senate and assembly districts--
liquor , mustn &apos;t think of liquor ...

wait a minute-- that feels good .
供应早午餐
so , a sober weekend hasn &apos;t been that hard .
let me just take a few antidepressants here .
i feel sorry for people without willpower .
i truly do .
homie , what are you drinking ?
a surprisingly not @-@ horrible fruit drink called a mimosa .
there &apos;s champagne in those !
then there &apos;s champagne in me !
oh , what am i gonna do ?
it &apos;s less than 24 hours till my drug test !
maybe i can sweat it out .
oh , man , i &apos;d better have some coffee and iced tea .
no ! irish and long island !
what about this lemonade ?
mike &apos;s hard !
then i better soak up the alcohol with some food !
whoo ! cake !
rum cake !
crepes !
suzette !
cherries !
whoo ! jubilee !
wow , passed with flying colors !
i &apos;ve sure earned this !
o , lord , i have once again besotted
my liver with thy fermented gifts .
if you can weasel me out of this physical ,
i will blow your mind by doing something
incredibly holy , at some point . amen .
now to mumble in a religious fashion .
dear god , o , lord , o , god , o , lord ...
o , lord , o , god , o , lord almighty .
your cells have been overexposed to gamma radiation .
like the hulk ?
well , sort of like the hulk .
but instead of getting powerful ,
you &apos;re going to get very , very sick .
hulk smash ...
yes , hulk smash .
mr. burns , you are liable
for thousands of dollars per employee ,
not to mention my extensive fees which ...
this trapdoor app works like a charm .
excellent .
you &apos;ll still have to pay !
this is the last time i pay the price
for the irritating mortality of the human worker .
smithers , it &apos;s time to re @-@ staff with
the super @-@ intelligent kangaroos we &apos;ve been breeding !
i &apos;m sorry , sir ,
but they just filled their pouches
with office supplies and hopped away .
even the joeys ?
you know , sir , there is a more high @-@ tech solution .
more high @-@ tech than kangaroos ?
ladies and gentlemen ,
meet the future masters of the human race .
comicon nerds !
you fool ! these are robots !
you will train them
and they will replace you .
i give you permission to shake your fists in anger twice .
i didn &apos;t say , monty says .
now i have cause to terminate .
this is crap .
now get out .
you didn &apos;t say monty says .
this is no game !
excellent .
sir , i &apos;m afraid we do need to keep one human worker--
to sign for packages , a scapegoat for meltdowns ,
things that would be a waste of the robots &apos; time .
so we need one meat sock on the payroll .
but who ?
mr. burns , before i leave ,
i got a few things to get off my chest .
one , i liked the new microwave in the break room .
just push &quot; popcorn , &quot; you don &apos;t have to know how long .
two , replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable .
three , how about a farewell party with a caricature artist ?
you know , it &apos;s something both kids and adults can enjoy .
so , to sum up : nicely done ,
we hate you , and food for thought .
simpson , wait !
as it turns out , there is one job available .
but be forewarned , it promises naught
but soul @-@ crushing boredom .
does the chair go back like this ?
yes .
well , looks like we &apos;ve found this plant &apos;s
one remaining worker of bone and sinew .
sir , i believe there are two , including yours truly .
it &apos;s one , excluding mine falsely !
well , surely no robot can replace me .
i can do that .
what about this ?
nice parking , idiot .
so , uh , you guys are my new coworkers .
so , workin &apos; hard or hardly workin &apos; ?
i said , workin &apos; hard or hardly workin &apos; ?
workin &apos; hard or hardly working ? !
working hard or hardly working ? !
it &apos;s a simple question !
working hard
i guess i just met the joker of the group .
better watch out for you on april fool &apos;s , am i right ?
i said , am i right ?
am i ...
so , you guys have any luck finding a new job ?
does it look like i &apos;ve got a job ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
homer , show a little more sensitivity
around these jobless washouts , eh ?
hey , i gotta tell ya , i &apos;m miserable there .
i &apos;m all alone ,
and when there &apos;s some problem due to human error ,
guess who gets blamed ?
hey , homer , you know what i &apos;m playing for ya ?
the world &apos;s smallest violin .
and now i got to sell it , just to make my rent !
oh , my god ! where &apos;s the bow ?
i can &apos;t sell it without the bow !
easy , easy there , lenny . you can always play it pizzicato .
the buyer clearly specified violin and bow !
um , maybe i should be heading home .
oh , no !
he stepped on the bow !
boy , this place has gotten so grim .
i &apos;m gonna do something i &apos;ve never done :
make myself a drink .
ugh ! you call this beer ?
it &apos;s watered @-@ down swill !
oh , you got a problem ?
well , here &apos;s the complaint department .
you know what i think , moe ? i think you ain &apos;t got the guts !
ha ! missed , ya son @-@ of @-@ a ...
* when the moon hits your eye *
* like a big pizza pie *
* that &apos;s amore *
* when the world seems ... *
when you do chair gondola all by yourself ,
it almost seems stupid .
ah , here it is--
hydraulic systems flush ...
eeprom bios auto boot ...
conversation mode ? ! they can talk ? !
i just have to press this button , right ...
well , at least it doesn &apos;t feel pain .
wait a minute ...
&quot; override self @-@ destruct protocol
with authorization code 7 ... 2 ... 2 ... 5 . &quot;
human interaction mode activated .
initiate conversation .
will you be my friend ?
friendship cannot exist between man and machine .
but i can simulate interest in your statements .
you &apos;re not a friend ...
you &apos;re my best friend .
uh , just don &apos;t ask me to drive you to the airport .
我们想不出任何安慰的话了
it &apos;s no fun to live in a town with a 99 % unemployment rate .
things are so bad .
look at what happened to the man on my pizza box .
mr. burns seemed like such a nice man the day he arrived .
cheap power , plentiful jobs ,
and all your swimming holes shall be warm and bubbling .
can i pet the elephant ?
of course .
guess i &apos;ll just have to become beautiful on the inside .
which he didn &apos;t .
i ain &apos;t paying !
two of my shortbreads were broken !
hey , check it out !
lenny &apos;s hit a new low !
i don &apos;t want my window washed !
too late !
i don &apos;t want my squeegee wiped !
i got what i needed .
that &apos;s it , boy .
live one more day .
good morning , class .
i &apos;m your substitute teacher ...
all right , who did that ?
fine . we will not be reading death in venice today .
someone &apos;s in a mood .
barney ?
hey , if we learned anything from the full monty ,
it &apos;s that in a tough economy ,
ugly people strip for money .
do a lot of people pay ?
no , but i can also play three @-@ card full monty .
follow the hats , where &apos;s the wiener ?
follow the hats , where &apos;s the wiener ?
now you see it , now you don &apos;t .
so , bart , the little dickens , is going through that phase
where young boys think their dad &apos;s an idiot .
sounds like you are having
family difficulties .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m having !
you guys totally get me .
we are programmed to respond to your verbal prompts .
could you give my wife a few lessons ?
hmm . your laughter indicates
you do not wish us to give your wife lessons .
so , uh , it &apos;s 5 : 00 . time for moe &apos;s .
my watch says 3 : 00 .
4 : 00.5 : 00 .
let &apos;s go .
automated workers are not able to leave the plant .
what happened to you guys ? you used to be cool .
we are the same temperature we have always been .
&quot; we &apos;re the same temperature we &apos;ve always been . &quot;
our programming restricts our movement
to yellow guidance lines .
play ball !
okay , i &apos;m up again .
according to the on @-@ line rules of baseball ,
all players get a turn &quot; at bat . &quot;
uh , right , right .
uh , actually , i &apos;m the designated hitter for all you guys .
the designated hitter corrupts the purity
of an otherwise elegant game ...
illogical , illogical .
fine . don &apos;t get your circuits in a bunch .
circuit @-@ bunching has yielded important advances
in modern robotics . to wit ...
shut up ! shut up ! shut up !
hey , dad , can we play ?
we cannot take the inferior one .
my heart makes up for my shortcomings , like rudy .
rudy was only put in at the end of a meaningless game .
we will notify you
if this game becomes meaningless .
i got it !
i got it !
i said i &apos;ve got it !
that could &apos;ve been my motherboard lying in the street !
our primary directive ...
is to preserve human life .
and here i was waiting till you slept
to rob you of your copper .
you know , it &apos;s crazy but ...
homer , move away from me .
you are still in the road .
hush , bionic prince ,
as i cradle your waning form .
such a peaceful end .
oh , geez !
get out of the road !
you stupid jerk !
axles to axles ,
rust to rust , amen .
amen .
dearly beloved , we are not here
to mourn their deactivation ,
but to celebrate their period of function .
can i hollow out this one &apos;s head and use it as a turtle tank ?
no ! i &apos;m already using it to put my keys in .
now , let me raise this beer to toast ...
what the ... ?
alcohol is harmful to humans .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , save your breath .
we have no breath .
we do vent nitrogen once a year .
you do not want to be around for that .
d &apos;oh ! i have some adjustments to make .
homer ...
when am i getting my power drill back ?
when i &apos;m done with my robo @-@ botomies .
primary directive deactivated .
our new primary directive
becomes removing all impediments to the plant .
uh , homer , i &apos;m afraid this is the part of god &apos;s perfect plan
where you &apos;re murdered by robots .
flanders , i don &apos;t judge a robot
by the color of their eyes , i look at their hands ...
which have turned into buzz saws .
son of a ... ! why did you do that ?
eliminate impediment . eliminate ...
just say &quot; kill me , &quot; jerks !
kill him . kill him .
dad , they can only go three miles an hour !
i &apos;m doomed ! can they climb stairs ?
with great difficulty .
i &apos;m doomed !
robots ... trying to kill me .
and now they &apos;ll kill you ,
&apos;cause i led them here !
now see here ! you are so not
the human automatons i was looking for .
there &apos;s one thing man has that machines can never match :
hounds !
fine , slink away . and guess what ?
all those times i said &quot; you &apos;re a good boy , &quot;
it was a lie !
no , stop !
i &apos;ll give you the combination to the num @-@ num safe !
flee , you fool !
aren &apos;t we getting num @-@ nums ?
ah . the solarium .
we &apos;ll be safely cornered in this glass room
with one door .
stop brandishing me .
sorry . before we die ,
can you tell me how old you really are ?
well , it has four digits ...
unemployed springfielders to the rescue !
and underemployed .
to servos with love .
guys , thank you .
the words &quot; prime directive &quot;
get thrown around a lot these days ,
but i &apos;m glad yours was saving me .
the saddest part is :
none of this had to happen .
if mr. burns had simply trusted the human worker .
or if someone , anyone , had told me
that robots were incapable of human feelings .
i told you precisely that fact 1,562 times ...
and his arm can be my back @-@ scratcher .
well , i &apos;ve learned the robotic worker is no match
for the old @-@ fashioned man of labor .
you &apos;re all hired back ... as temps .
homer , why have you reprogrammed me for this ?
i &apos;m giving you your wish :
to be a real boy .
i am real and i do not have wishes .
then take us out to sea !
i am not a transformer .
i cannot turn into an outboard motor .
oh , i believe you ,
but flanders &apos; drill doesn &apos;t .
ah , this is the life .
* there &apos;s electric cars , there &apos;s electric trains *
* here comes a robot with electric brains *
* robot parade , robot parade *
* wave the flags that the robots made *
* robot parade , robot parade *
* robots obey what the children say . *
