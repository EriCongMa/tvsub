"Sorry seems to be the hardest word"
Let's see. Maybe...
Crap.
Doctors never mean to screw up.
Crap, crap, crap. Crap!
Are you sure you don't want me to call for--
No! There's no time.
You make a bad call, and...
the unthinkable happens.
Can I help you?
Yeah, do you have any just, um, regular panty hose?
We can't do that.
Well, we have to. Lap pads!
But we still haven't--
I don't care! We're closing him up.
Zero vicryl. Zero vicryl now.
Am I not being clear? Why do you look so confused? Why--
What about these? They're popular. They shimmer.
No. No, no shimmer.
No footless tights
or freaky little toe sock thingies.
I just--I just want panty hose, basic nude.
I used to buy them at the grocery store.
They come--they come in a little plastic egg kind of panty hose!
That's--that's what I need!
Is that really so hard to understand?!
It's not like we do it on purpose.
It's not like we want to hurt anyone.
But sometimes we do.
Sometimes we make mistakes.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
And when we blow it, we're sorry.
That was--that was inappropriate.
I'm...
I'm just--I'm under a lot of pressure right now,
and I have a really big day tomorrow.
You know what? That's fine.
These are--these are-- these are fine. These are great.
Actually, I'll take all these.
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna take 'em all.
Really?
Yeah.
Just, uh, ring me up.
Even these, the ones with the rhinestones?
Even those. Okay.
Not that being sorry really matters.
Not anymore.
No apology in the world matters now.
Brain mapping is not an exact science yet.
But this array brings us one step closer.
Dr. Torres and I have had tremendous success so far,
and because of that,
we are moving from an animated hand
to a robotic one.
Oh, she's on the stage.
I'm sorry, sir. Are you lost?
Sorry. I'm looking for... Dr. Torres?
Yes. Hi.
Great. You're being sued.
Love what you're doing here, by the way.
Robot hands. Freaky!
Who is that from?
Travis Reed?
Uh-huh.
As in the Travis Reed, the snowboarder?
Uh, he needs a new hip.
I told him he wants you.
Wait. How do you even know him?
I was a second-year resident.
He was my first solo valve replacement.
Yeah, and six months before he came out of nowhere
and won all those gold medals on the half-pipe.
I believe my valve is what gives him his edge.
His heart is my "Mona lisa."
Don't screw it up.
Excuse me. Where's the onesie decorating station?
There isn't one.
There's a margarita decorating station, though.
What?
Limes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What kind of baby shower...
Salt.
doesn't have a onesie decorating station?
I mean, I had already figured out my design.
It was gonna be a star and a moon,
and it was gonna say "McDreamy."
Get it? That's cute, right?
Excuse me.
Is it time to open the gifts yet? I need to sit down.
My feet are like sausages.
Oh, come on, Mer.
Oh, look at her. She's all glowy and pregnant,
with sausage feet.
Let's have a baby.
What?
Wait. Wait, what? Are you serious?
We've had such a hard year since the crash,
and... wouldn't it be nice
to have something new and happy to think about?
Yes. Yes. But, um, I--
And, you know, I could carry-- I could carry this time.
And then that way, only one of our feet would be sausages.
Arizona...
So... you want to?
Yes! Oh, my god, yes!
You seem happy.
Oh, I am happy. I am really, really happy.
He is so much more attractive in person.
I got him to sign my board.
I got him to sign my bra.
Yeah, sign my cast!
So are they.
Cristina Yang!
Oh, you look better and better every time I see you.
Dump your husband. Run away with me.
Oh, come on. Don't you have a girlfriend?
Oh, we've got a deal.
I'm allowed to flirt with hot doctors
who've had their hands inside my chest.
It's a very short list.
Hey, I'm Travis.
Hi.
You're the ortho god?
Callie Torres. I prefer goddess.
Right on.
Ready to build me a new hip?
He needs to be able to do this.
See? Right... there.
Can a new hip do that?
More importantly, will he be doing it by December?
He's got olympic qualifiers coming up.
You mentioned a crash last year?
They said it gave me arthritis.
He can't win the gold with arthritis.
I want the Peterson hip.
Buddy of mine got this one.
He was back on the mountain in no time.
This is what I need.
Okay.
Even if I did agree that a hip replacement
is the right course of treatment,
I-I've never even used, the, uh,
Peterson resurfacing hip joint.
I doubt you or your team want you to be my first.
She makes a good point.
I was Yang's first valve replacement. That worked out.
I was the first guy to land a triple cork in competition.
Now it's practically standard.
You're the first orthopedic surgeon to grow cartilage
out of nothing.
The reason we are who we are,
is 'cause we're not scared of firsts.
I'll research the joint. I'll learn what I can.
I'm not making any promises.
I'm not worried.
You're gonna say "Yes."
For the hundredth time, no.
I am not admitting to negligence
when there was no negligence. I--
They're willing to call you a "Nonparty at fault."
Jury payouts are always bigger than pretrial settlements.
If this goes south--
Do you think it'll go south?
There was a minor complication during surgery
because we thought the patient had developed
a pulmonary embolus.
Postoperative infections are a common recognized risk.
Everybody--
and that's when the jury's eyes will glaze over.
All they're gonna hear is a bunch of big words
they don't understand. And what they will see
is that you made a mistake, and your patient paid the price.
No, it wasn't a mistake,
Greg. I'm not settling.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Then there are things to remember tomorrow--
let the jury see your face. You wear a suit.
Dark not bright. Skirt not pants.
Minimal jewelry, heels,
panty hose--
Panty hose?
Professional but feminine.
You still have your wedding ring?
Yes.
Wear it.
Juries respond better to married women with families.
Now there'll be water in front of your seat.
You drink it sparingly.
There are no bathroom breaks
till the judge calls for recess.
I don't own any panty hose.
I-I-I have to go shopping.
Did you flush?
I didn't-I didn't hear you flush.
Oh, and wash your hands! It's almost time to go!
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. There was traffic.
No, no, it's fine. She's ready.
Well, she was until she decided she had to wear
the purple dress instead of the heart dress.
And then she had to go potty
but she didn't want help going potty. Sofia!
You should probably go check
and make sure she's okay in there.
What--are you okay?
Uh, I have no idea.
Hey, listen, I know you're supposed to have Sofia tonight,
but if it'd be easier for you to spend some time alone
or if you'd rather not be alone then, you know,
You just tell me, and whatever you need that's what we'll do.
Okay, thanks.
What?
Nothing.
You put your ring back on.
They told me to.
Anyway, good luck today.
Thanks.
You ready?
Sure.
Excuse me. No comment.
Doctor, what happened?
Greg? Greg?!
Step aside.
Good morning.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Uh, a bunch of us are taking shifts.
We wanted you to have at least one person
in court with you the entire time.
I had to fight Bailey for this first shift.
Turns out she punches pretty hard for such a little person.
Excuse us! Thank you.
Dr. Torres!
I can't even swallow. My mouth is so dry.
You can do this. I will be sitting right behind you.
We're up here.
Callie?
Oh, damn it!
All rise!
Would if I could.
Crap.
This case is about a man that you probably already know--
at least by reputation, Mr. Travis Reed.
I got here as soon as I could.
My nephrectomy went long. What'd I miss?
They're still on opening statements.
This guy's been going for a while.
He's doing that folksy charm thing,
And the jury is eating it up.
Now serving as a juror in a medical malpractice case isn't easy.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm no doctor.
Hell, I barely made it through high school biology, so...
But you are going to get a crash course education
in orthopedic medicine and postoperative infections.
And you're gonna hear words like "Pseudomonas" And "Emboli."
Don't let that intimidate you.
The only thing that matters is the evidence.
Those things are part of the evidence.
What is he talking about?
Shh.
And the evidence in this case will focus on
a 16-day period last spring.
And during this time we will establish that Dr. Torres
agreed to perform a surgery she did not fully understand.
We will establish that Dr. Torres made a series
of faulty decisions, eventually costing Mr. Travis Reed--
a thriving, healthy olympic athlete--
his legs.
And we will establish that all of this started
because of one careless mistake made in surgery.
Implant's in place. Everything looks good.
Now I just need to irrigate--
His heart rate just jumped to the 150s.
Having trouble ventilating.
Increasing his oxygen to 100%.
Damn it. All right, could be a P.E.
We've gotta get him off this table.
All right, let's start closing. Irrigation, please.
Wait, the sponge count is off.
We're missing one sponge.
Are you kidding me?
We can't close until we find it.
Sats are continuing to drop. Switching to manual ventilation.
All right, you know, it's gotta be on someone's shoe
or something. There's nothing in here.
You want me to call for a portable X-ray?
No, that'll take too long. He could go into shock.
B.P.'s dropped to 70 over 40.
Oh, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
Are you sure you don't want me to call for...
No, there's no time.
All right, we're closing him up.
You can't do that!
Well, you know, uh, we have to. Lap pads.
We still haven't--
I don't care. We're closing him up.
Zero vicryl.
Zero vicryl now!
Now!
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Are you saying that Dr. Torres knew she left a sponge
in Mr. Reed's body,
and she didn't care?
No, of course she cared but...
No, but still,
she knowingly left behind a sponge.
The patient was running out of time. He would have--
Hon, hon, it's a yes or no question. Thank you.
Did she knowingly leave a sponge?
Yes.
You know, I've got a-- I've got a boy in college. Good kid.
And I went to visit him last month,
and you would not believe the sponge I found in his sink.
I mean, there's no tellin' what was going on--
Objection. Irrelevant.
Sustained.
All right, let's fast-forward
to the next time you saw Mr. Reed.
About two weeks later.
And how was he then?
Was he... good? Happy? Recovering well?
He had an infection.
Hi, there.
Travis, I hear you got quite the fever.
Temp's 103. I'm just starting his workup.
He's burning up. He won't eat.
I had to force him to come in.
How are you feeling, Travis?
I've seen worse.
Dr. Torres, you wanna take a listen to this?
Yeah.
Is that a murmur?
A small one. Travis,
I'm just gonna take a look at your incision site, okay?
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow? What does "Oh, wow" Mean?
Whitney, I don't want you to worry.
The wound looks a little infected.
So we're just gonna go in and clean it all out, okay?
Yeah. Okay.
Okay, get him on vanc and clinda, stat.
Call upstairs. I need an O.R. right now.
What about the murmur?
Could the infection have traveled to his heart?
His vitals are stable.
So first, We've got to clean out that joint, okay?
We can't afford any delays.
Okay. Should I call Yang?
All right, if she's not available in the next five minutes,
she waits until post-op.
We've got to get in there
and kill this infection before it spreads any further.
I am not turning an olympic athlete into a doorstop.
Yeah, the infection's going through the fascia
down to the prosthesis.
Get in here and irrigate before we move on.
Looks like there's pus in the acetabulum.
Oh, damn it!
No, there's no way to salvage the joint.
I'm gonna have to remove the whole thing.
And just... leave him with no hip?
Well, for now.
It's the only way to get this completely cleaned out.
Osteotome and mallet?
That sounds pretty nasty.
Post-op infections are very common. They happen all the time.
Is that your professional opinion?
It is.
I see.
And in your professional opinion,
is it also common for a post-op infection
to result in a double amputation?
Does that happen all the time, too?
No, but, uh...
No, uh, no further questions, your honor.
That's not fair! You're not letting me finish.
That's enough, Dr. Wilson.
But I need to explain...
Another word out of turn, and I'll hold you in contempt.
Tell me I packed a spare pair.
Oh, thank god.
Oh, hi. I'm sorry.
I-I'll come back.
No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine.
I'm just, um, I have to sit in there and listen to that guy.
And I can't react
or that'll make me look unlikable or petty.
But how the hell am I not supposed to react?
He's awful.
And he's making me sound awful.
I think I have something that will make you feel better.
So Sofia drew this in the car this morning.
And she said that it's of a jellyfish and a rainbow mermaid.
I'm not sure which one is which.
But you should have it.
And then when you feel like screaming,
you can look at the jellyfish and then it will calm you down.
I'm surprised you're here.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I should get back. Oh, god.
Um, Callie?
Yes?
Are you sure that you wanna wear, um,
rhinestone butterflies in court?
I mean, it's--it's your choice.
It's a strange one.
But I suppose that lots of people like butterflies so...
They're cute.
What?
Are you kidding me?
No more ridiculous than vetoing every guy under 6'3."
We are not choosing our sperm donor based on his taste in music.
Well... oh, look. Oh, this one's cute.
Oh, that's a super cute baby.
He would make super cute babies.
Yeah!
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so. Here...
He's a college dropout.
Pass.
Pass.
Okay, uh--ooh, I'm empty.
Now this one says he's a mathematician
with a graduate degree.
And... he runs marathons.
Oh, picture?
Okay, um...
Well, I still like the Ivy League poet.
Okay, let's...
Smart and crtive.
You think I'll like being pregnant?
Oh, yeah. It's the best.
Oh, except for the nausea. Oh, and the stretch marks.
And the peeing.
And the lack of sleep, the exhaustion.
Oh, and then the... the no booze.
No booze.
Mnh-mnh.
Oh, I will miss you most of all.
Arizona?
You're, uh, you're early. I thought--
I thought you said you weren't bringing her by till after dinner.
Daddy.
Mija.
You mentioned the trial like it was nothing.
It's never nothing.
You know how many times I've been sued?
My lawyer's on speed dial, for crying out loud.
He's very good. Technically, his tactics are legal.
You really didn't have to come all this way.
Of course I did. Of course I did.
My baby's in trouble.
But first, where's my grandbaby? Mm-hmm. Come on, now.
Abuelo needs a hug.
Don't tell me she's already asleep.
No. N-no. She's, um...
She's--well, she's not here.
Arizona's gonna bring her by in an hour.
Oh, all right. Well, I don't understand.
Wh-what's going on?
We split up. She cheated on me. It's been bad.
I really don't wanna talk about it.
When did this happen?
A couple months ago.
Why didn't you tell me?
I just, I didn't wanna get into it, Dad.
I-I fought so hard just to get you to accept us.
Mom hasn't spoken to me since the wedding.
And I just... appantly, I marry people who cheat on me.
It's pathetic.
I am pathetic.
No.
When that O'malley kid cheated on you,
I was ready to knock his teeth out.
Now--now I won't hit a lady but, you know, I can make it happen.
I know people. Just say the word, all right?
No, dad. God, no.
All right.
Look at me.
Mija, look at me.
Nothing about you is pathetic.
Don't hate me!
I know I said I was gonna cook dinner tonight,
but I've still got a lot of work to catch up on.
So... who wants pizza?
Hey, sweetie. Where's mommy?
Callie?
Yeah. Hi, I'm home!
Is everything okay?
Callie!
Are you okay? Is ev-everything all right?
We're having a baby.
My boobs were hurting, and-- and then I thought... maybe?
But I'm only a day late and I-I didn't even think
that it would show up on a test so soon.
We're having a baby!
We're having a baby!
Hi.
Hi, sweet baby.
All right, gonna make this quick.
I know we are all busy.
Callie, I thought you understood you can't be here.
I know.
I know it's a conflict of interest.
I just--I wanted to say something before you get started.
Travis Reed is suing both me and the hospital.
I have no intention of settling with him,
But the hospital should.
As an owner and a member of the board,
I know how hard it's been to get this place back on its feet.
And I don't want you to jeopardize that because of me.
What did our legal team say?
Um, yeah, they said that we should settle now, quickly and quietly.
What if we don't?
Well, this thing goes to trial
and there's a judgment against us,
We could owe millions or we could settle this for much less.
If we go to trial, we risk bankruptcy all over again.
Only if we lose. There's another side to this.
If Callie isn't settling, maybe neither should we.
Uh, no. I was there.
I saw firsthand what happened with this patient.
And he has a case. A good case.
We should settle.
And, frankly, Callie should, too.
Dr. Yang, what is your relationship with Travis Reed?
Uh, Travis first came to me six years ago
with a bicuspid aortic valve.
I replaced the valve,
And have overseen his cardiac care ever since.
And it was you, I believe, who recommended him to Dr. Torres.
Is that right?
That's right.
Why was that?
Because she was the best orthopedic surgeon I knew.
Was?
As in past tense?
You don't believe she's the best anymore?
There are vegetations all over his aortic valve.
Why didn't you page me sooner?
We just heard the murmur this morning.
This morning?
Look at this growth. You knew he was a heart patient.
This didn't concern you?
Of course it did. That's why you're here.
So what do we do?
The infection is eating away at his graft.
Best case--I go in, clean it out, and repair it.
Worst case--he needs a whole new valve.
Dr. Torres, you need to see this.
I was changing his compression socks and I saw this.
His leg's gray, cold. I can't find a pulse.
Okay, where's Whitney?
I told her she had time to grab lunch before Travis woke up.
All right, you need to go find her
and tell her that Travis needs another surgery.
Okay.
Okay, I've gotta go in and do an embolectomy on this leg--
Unh-unh, no. I gotta go in and fix his heart.
You can do that later. I need to do this now.
Later? It's already later.
He has lost blood flow!
He's clearly throwing emboli into his extremities.
And where do you think the emboli is coming from?
His infected heart.
Cristina--
Hey, hey, hey!
I can hear you two from all the way the damn hallway.
Will you tell Callie to back off and let me do my job?
Yeah, tell Cristina to back off and let me do mine.
If I don't try this embolectomy,
he could lose his leg.
Well, he can live without a leg.
He can't live without a functioning heart.
Look, if you do the heart tomorrow,
it gives him an extra day on antibiotics, all right?
He'll be more stable, and the heart surgery will be less risky.
Cristina, this is Travis Reed we're talking about.
Let me try to save his leg.
Dr. Torres performed the embolectomy that afternoon.
Against your wishes?
We had a professional difference of opinion.
You know, in my office, if one of my co-workers
was shouting at me so loudly that
you could hear him all the way down the hall,
it would more than just a difference of opinion.
It would be grounds for a dismissal.
We are passionate about our work.
And in the end, I agreed with Dr. Torres,
that the heart surgery could wait.
You agreed?
Yes.
Are you sure you weren't bullied?
Objection.
Yeah, I know.
The embolectomy could not have gone better.
I mean, his leg was already pinking up
by the time I saw him in recovery last night.
What's his temp?
Oh, he was febrile overnight but his white count's stable.
What's going on?
Travis?
What aren't you telling me?
What's wrong?
What the hell is wrong with my legs?!
Are we losing this case?
It's... too early to panic.
We haven't presented our side.
There she is.
Richard! Well, you shouldn't be here.
That's what I told him, but he insisted on coming.
It's a miracle I made it here at all.
Kepner's a terrible driver.
How's it goin'?
You knew it was bad.
His legs were black. I knew it wasn't good.
They cut them off that night.
Now did you have any indication that Dr. Torres
was even worried about something like amputation?
I mean, did she ever mention that it might be even a risk?
No.
But she was worried about it.
She was worried about what it would do to her reputation.
What is she talking about?
Now why would you say that?
I-I have no idea.
I heard her talking in the hallway.
She didn't know I could hear her.
What did she say?
She said, "I can't be the doctor
who turns an olympic athlete into a doorstop."
All right, quiet down!
Quiet down, everyone!
Quiet down!
Do we knock?
No, there's an open house on Sunday.
We can come back then.
Oh, oh! There's a swing set!
Oh, and a pool! A pool!
Callie there's a pool!
Ooh! Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, I can just see us
playing with the girls in this yard,
having a picnic, and swinging on the swings.
Ohh. What makes you think we're having another girl?
Come on.
Can you get off of that thing for five seconds
and look at this place?
Yeah, I know, hold on a second.
I'm just, uh, I'm following up on that clinical trial
in Germany using Peterson hip joints.
I'm trying to get them to send me their data.
Well, they're not gonna release anything until it's published.
Eh. It's worth a shot.
There, sent.
All right, now you can show me the swing set.
Okay.
You okay? You all right?
Yeah. I got it.
I've got it.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Hey, Travis.
Hey.
You know, I'm, uh...
I'm thinking about snowboarding.
In fact, I picked up a board--
a Burton blunt.
You familiar with that one?
That's a good board.
There's better boards for beginners.
What size shoe are you?
I'm a 13.
You might wanna look into an extra wide,
so your toes don't hang over too much.
A little over hang's fine,
but too much is gonna cause drag.
And drag's bad?
Well--
Objection, your honor. Where's this going?
Look, I'm simple consulting an expert on snowboarding
about a snowboard.
I mean, who should I trust more,
this guy or the kid who's helping me out at R.E.I.?
Get to the point, Mr. Hamilton.
Travis, when you first met Dr. Torres,
did you ask her about a certain kind of joint?
The Peterson joint.
I'd heard it was good for athletes.
You know, quicker recovery, better range of motion.
So you were consulting an expert on joint replacement
about a joint.
Yeah.
Is it true that Dr. Torres had never actually done
an operation with this kind of joint before?
It's true.
But you went ahead with it anyway.
She said she had done a lot of research.
She said she was confident.
So you trusted her to use her expertise to advise you,
and to keep you safe.
When, in fact, what you got was a botched surgery,
an infection, a revision surgery,
a heart surgery... and...
I mean, look at you now.
Just let me pull up the blanket.
Why? So you don't have to look at them?
There's nothing there.
Is it her?
Hey, Travis.
Tell her to go.
I don't wanna see her. I don't wanna talk to her.
Um, I just brought you some information on support groups.
Um, try to get him to go. And, oh, on the back,
there's a name of an incredible prosthetist--
Tell her to get out. I trusted her.
I trusted her completely, and...
you know, I get that people live without legs
and it's not the end of the world, but...
it's the end of my world.
I've been snowboarding since I was 5.
I used to steal cafeteria trays from school
and ride 'em down my parents' driveway.
Snow or no snow, I didn't care.
It was the thing I did for fun.
Then it became my job and my world.
And now it's... everything--
my family, my friends.
Without it...
I don't know who I am.
And now it's gone. It's just...
gone.
And it's Dr. Torres' fault.
You feel very strongly about that.
It's not just a feeling.
I know it. She told me.
What, she admitted that she was at fault?
Yes, she did.
The day she cut off my legs, she came into my room,
she'd been crying.
She told me she was sorry.
Objection!
It is illegal to use a physician's apology
against them as evidence of guilt.
Your honor, this isn't about the apology.
This is about everything else she said with the apology.
I'll allow it.
Travis, I know this is gonna be painful,
so you take your time.
What else did Dr. Torres say?
She said if there was anyone to blame, it was her.
She said this never should've happened.
She said if there was any way
she could change things, she would.
Those were her exact words?
Yes, they were.
The prosecution rests.
Yes, we had so much fun today. Big hugs.
I love you. I love you.
Mwah. I know!
Okay, all right, honey. I'll see you soon.
Hey, your dad's making me a little nervous.
Yeah, you should probably go now.
Definitely go now.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye bye!
Bye bye!
Thank you for not saying anything to her.
If my grandbaby hadn't been standing right there,
believe me, I would've said plenty.
Dad, don't start right now. I have to be in court soon.
I have to take the stand today, and I'm just...
Your mother and I have been married 38 years.
You think it's been easy?
No, don't.
You think we haven't had troubles?
Don't do that. Don't start comparing. Don't.
What happened to her "Good man in a storm" baloney?
It's not right. She should be here
every day trying to fix it.
It's not like that.
Oh, no? The hell it isn't.
She hurt you. And now she's too much of a coward
to even-- to even face you.
Now she's running away abandoning her family.
No, she's not running away, all right? I kicked her out.
It was my choice to split up. It was mine.
All right, so just drop it, okay?
You chose to break up your family?
Dad, not now.
Did you even try to work things out?
Dad
I knew what I was doing.
I did extensive research on the Peterson hip.
I even spoke with the team who invented it.
Everyone agreed that Travis was an ideal candidate.
And the surgery? It went smoothly?
The cut position and the femoral resurfacing were perfect.
What wasn't perfect?
Well, at the end of surgery, the patient desatted--
which means his oxygen level went down
and his heart was beating really fast,
which is really dangerous.
We thought he might have a clot in his lungs,
So it was vital we finish the surgery quickly.
And that's when you left the sponge.
Yes.
And I would do it again.
Well, the patient's life was at risk.
I-I believe that the sponge wouldn't compromise the joint.
I made a call, and I was right.
It was the right call.
So leaving the sponge was deliberate.
Not a mistake.
You weren't being careless or distracted.
Make sure his B.P. and O-2 sats stay stable.
And bring me his post-op X-ray.
I wanna locate that sponge.
Got it.
You missed our appointment. Hmm?
Oh, damn it!
I-I'm so sorry. I-- my surgery went long,
and I completely forgot. How'd it go?
I mean, I know the ultrasound's just a blob at this point,
but still...
Did you get a picture of the blob?
There's no picture.
And no heartbeat.
What?
She did the ultrasound and she looked and she looked.
But there's no heartbeat.
We lost the baby?
I remember the day very clearly.
I wasn't distracted.
Sure, I had other things going on.
Big things, actually.
But... it's my job to prioritize my patient,
and that's exactly what I did.
I wasn't focused on anything or...
anyone other than my patient.
Let's talk about this embolectomy.
Dr. Yang wanted to do the heart surgery first.
You wanted to work on Travis's leg.
Yes.
Why?
Well, his foot was turning gray,
which is an indication that the limb is starting to die.
And I wanted to restore blood flow.
Once a limb turns black, there's nothing we can do.
According to Dr. Yang's testimony, she wanted to go first
because the infection had moved to Travis's heart,
throwing out emboli-- or clots-- all over his body.
And she knew that the heart would keep throwing out clots
until it was repaired. So--
Do you cook?
Uh, a little.
Okay, let's say you're cooking,
and you start a grease fire in your kitchen.
And then it spreads to your curtains.
What do you do?
Do you put out the grease fire?
Or do you extinguish the curtains?
Which disaster do you tackle first?
If I hadn't treated the emboli when I did,
Travis would've lost his leg for sure.
I was just picking which disaster to tackle first.
I cannot believe you're picking this fight right now!
I'm not trying to pick a fight.
I am trying to tell you how I feel.
Okay, well, I feel like crap, too.
Okay? It wasn't just your kid.
I know. I know that.
Look, we just--we'll just, look, we don't--
We don't have to try again right away, all right?
We can wait a while before we try again.
No. We--
No, no. You're missing the point.
What point?
I can't take another loss, Callie.
I can't handle it!
I can't--I can't think about this right now.
It's just--it's too hard. It's just too hard!
What--what are you saying?
Now you don't want another baby?
Answer me.
I don't know.
I have to go check on my patient.
Tell her to get out!
Travis--
I don't want her here. Kick her out, Whit, now!
God knows I can't do it by myself.
So get her the hell out of here!
What's wrong with you?! Why aren't you doing anything?!
Okay, that's enough!
Whitney, go to the family lounge and get a snack.
We need a minute, okay?
Don't you dare take this out on her.
You are hurt and angry
and you have every right to feel those things.
But Whitney has nothing to do with that.
You--you wanna take your crap out on somebody,
you take it out on me, all right? I can handle it.
You--you need somebody to blame? Then blame me. Go on.
Yell all you want.
This never should've happened to you.
And if there were any way,
that I could magically change things,
Believe me, I would.
I wish there was something I could do.
I wish I could fix this.
I tried. I tried so hard.
I'm so sorry, Travis.
I'm so, so sorry.
Yes, I apologized.
I understood what Travis was feeling.
I went through the same thing with my wife.
She... she lost her leg last year,
and, um, it's changed us.
It's, uh, cost us in ways that I...
I can't even begin to understand.
I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.
And now it was happening to my patient.
Of course I was sorry.
I still am.
I'm--I'm so, so sorry this happened to you, Travis.
Th-that makes me human.
That does not make me negligent.
And if I can't feel for my patients without getting sued,
then I guess I'm just gonna keep on getting sued,
because that's who I am.
I won't apologize for that.
Dad, we're home.
We're back. Oh, I guess he's still out in the park with the girls.
How long do you think it's gonna take
for the jury to come back?
I don't know. Could be days, sometimes weeks.
What's that?
I think it's from a clinical trial on the Peterson hip.
I thought I never heard back.
"Enclosed is the data you requested."
"But please be advised,
we've currently put a stop to our trial.
There've been five instances
of infection caused by the pseudomonas bacteria."
"We've traced the source back to the Peterson joint."
What's the postmark on that?
Three weeks before Travis' surgery.
I can't just sit on this. I have to tell them, right?
I wouldn't. You didn't willfully ignore any data.
You didn't act irresponsibly or maliciously.
You worked off the information you had at the time.
And then an act of god happened.
The letter fell behind the bookcase.
It could've just as easily gotten lost in the mail.
But it didn't.
Accidents happens.It's the job.
This one happened in your living room, not in the O.R..
I--you know, I-I was distracted. I-I wasn't paying attention.
I should've followed up when I never heard back.
You feel bad because of what happened,
and anybody would.
But that envelope is not a magic cure.
It's not going to grow his legs back.
But what it could do? It could sway a jury.
It could make a jury think differently about you,
and that could end your career--
Not because you were negligent
and not because you did anything wrong,
but because you feel bad? Because you feel guilty?
Let's not confuse emotion with fact.
And the fact is, you did nothing wrong.
Yes, I did.
Hey.
Okay. Thanks.
They've reached a verdict.
We've all done things we aren't proud of.
I understand that.
I know nobody's perfect.
But how do you live with it?
How do you get up every morning and face the world,
knowing you could've done better?
That you should've done better?
Is being sorry enough?
Can an apology actually heal our wounds?
Ease our pain?
Can they undo the hurt that have caused?
I really don't think so, dad.
I-it's not enough. Just because she says she's sorry...
You're married. You took a vow.
You don't walk away from that.
If things get hard, you work harder.
I mean, you have a child together, for god's sake.
She cheated on me.
I cheated on your mother.
What?
I-I'm sorry. What?!
A long time ago.
We--we--we were young. I was stupid.
But your mother found it in her heart to forgive me.
Why? Why would she do that?
Why?
Because she believed we were stronger than one mistake.
And I thank god every day she did.
Because otherwise, I wouldn't have you.
38 years.
We've shared a life.
And it all started after that one mistake.
Now things between you and Arizona might not work out.
You know, you might not be able to fix it.
But how will you know if you never try?
Just a second!
Oh, you're not bringing me extra pillows.
You did something impulsive,
and, uh, you were thinking about yourself.
It seemed right at the time,
and, uh...
You made a mistake.
One mistake.
Do we have to get into this now?
I did something like that today.
Oh. Okay.
Look, I have something to ask, and, uh,
you should probably take some time to think about it.
I don't need an answer tonight, but I-I would like to know...
if you'll come home.
You should get dressed now
