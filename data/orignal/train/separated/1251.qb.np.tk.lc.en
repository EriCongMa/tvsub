i told you not to ask mary for help .
if i &apos;d listened to you
i wouldn &apos;t have seen mary and elliott together .
so you saw them arguing ? what &apos;s so suspicious about that ?
no , it was the way that they argued .
like they were familiar with each other .
ali called me begging for help .
she &apos;s clearly scared of someone in there .
ali &apos;s in trouble . maybe there &apos;s something in here
that can help you find a connection between mary and elliott .
caleb told me about what happened
between you two at the lost woods .
spencer , i &apos;m so sorry .
i like everything about you .
yeah , but that &apos;s the problem . you like me , but i love you .
elliott just sent me a text .
it &apos;s a pin drop of his location .
guys , i don &apos;t think this is elliott sending the text .
i think alison is .
watch out !
oh , my god .
i don &apos;t know if i can live with this .
i mean , how can we bury ..
there has to be another way .
there is no other way , emily !
it was a well thought @-@ out plan and when it ends up like this
it &apos;s called first @-@ degree murder .
look , spencer is right .
just come on .
what are we gonna do with them ?
she &apos;s in shock . it will wear off .
hanna ..
maybe you should go wait in the car with alison .
seriously , we got it . just go sit in the car .
no , i need to help .
okay , because if i don &apos;t do something , then ...
hanna , if you want to
it &apos;s still not too late to go to the police .
we &apos;ve been over this , aria .
i know and i still don &apos;t know
why we can &apos;t tell them exactly what happened .
elliott hurt hanna , abducted ali and--
... and the car didn &apos;t stop in time .
no one &apos;s gonna believe us when we have every reason
in the world to have wanted him dead .
we need to tell the truth .
yeah , what truth is that ?
the one where hanna doesn &apos;t know the right pedal from the left ?
everyone just take a breath . okay ?
freaking out is not gonna help any of us .
we have one choice here
and it is to make it look like rollins skipped town .
and why is anyone gonna believe that ?
because he was a dirtbag .
look , all we need to do is cover our tracks .
yeah , is that all ?
we should be good at it by now .
we &apos;ve had a lot of practice .
look , if this is gonna work
we &apos;ve got to get her back to welby
before anyone notices she &apos;s missing .
what if they already have ?
no , at night , the nurses don &apos;t check
the patients unless they &apos;re called .
they won &apos;t need a call .
they &apos;ll hear us from a mile away
with all the shattered glass we &apos;re trailing .
no , we have to leave lucas &apos; car here .
how do we even get to welby ?
it &apos;s not like we can just knock on the front door .
you &apos;re gonna need this .
第七季第四集
there &apos;s nothing weird in here
other than the fact that there &apos;s nothing weird in here .
no , that &apos;s not possible .
as far as i can tell , the guy never even used an emoji .
well , he probably just deleted everything
once he realized that we were on to him .
wipe it down first .
you know , you always used to make fun of me
for carrying these around , but now who &apos;s an uptight nerd ?
you , still you .
so i @-@ i &apos;ll just text you guys when i &apos;m inside ?
no , only after you &apos;ve already left
because if i get to the train station too early
it will screw up our whole timeline .
his timeline .
same thing .
yeah , and by the time the police realize that he &apos;s missing
and they start tracking his phone
he &apos;ll be halfway to delaware .
at least his jacket will be .
god .
hanna , what &apos;s wrong ?
what do you mean &quot; what &apos;s wrong &quot; ?
i mean , what @-@ what are we doing ?
we &apos;re never gonna get away with this .
okay , don &apos;t say that .
who else is gonna say it , emily ?
we &apos;ve thought of everything .
nobody thinks of everything .
okay , i &apos;m going to jail .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m going to jail . i &apos;m ..
i &apos;m going to jail for , for ..
vehicular manslaughter ?
yeah , vehicular manslaughter .
god , we &apos;re never gonna be able pull this off .
&apos;i mean , there &apos;re way too many things that could screw us up.&apos;
we &apos;ve probably already done 50 things wrong by now .
hanna , please stop . okay ?
you &apos;re not the only person who buried a body back there .
guys , if we just stay calm
and stick to the plan , we &apos;ll be fine , okay ?
this is about containment
and right now , everyone who knows about rollins
is sitting in this car .
his car is a mess .
it &apos;s gonna take you forever to clean everything up .
if you wanna help , then stop pacing .
you &apos;re tracking mud everywhere .
maybe i should give him a call .
tell him i &apos;m gonna be late for my shift .
no , nothing can seem out of the ordinary .
i &apos;ll meet you right after i &apos;m done here .
oh , my god .
if mr. mizzari could see me right now
i totally would have gotten the part of lady macbeth .
how does it feel to be clean ?
i wouldn &apos;t know .
spencer , i could help you with that .
no , i got it .
you &apos;re bleeding .
it &apos;s not mine .
spence , can we please just move forward ?
i swear i wasn &apos;t--
spencer ?
spencer .
spencer , i know you &apos;re in there .
if i have to break open a window
just to make sure you &apos;re okay , i swear to god i--
no , no , i @-@ i &apos;m ..
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m here .
can you let me in please ?
i can &apos;t really do this right now .
well , i @-@ i wanna talk to you .
come on , spence , this is stupid .
can @-@ can i just call you tomorrow ?
i &apos;ll call you first thing in the morning--
no , no . no , wait . wait .
look , i &apos;m an idiot , okay ?
everything came out wrong earlier .
the ..
what happened with hanna , it was like
this @-@ this wound that i &apos;d worked so hard to heal--
okay , caleb . i really can &apos;t hear this right now .
it was confusing , but that &apos;s all it was .
it was a moment of confusion--
i &apos;m begging you , just leave !
okay , re @-@ re @-@ remember my first summer in d.c. ?
you and i just started hanging out a lot and
this one night we met for a beer .
well , i @-@ i had gotten a job offer in san francisco
but we were having such a good time
that i decided to wait to tell you i was moving
until after our drink .
but then you noticed that they were playing
&quot; bringing up baby &quot; at the new waverly .
do you remember ?
afterward , i walked you to your apartment
so i could tell you about my job .
but there was this violinist playing on kenyon
so we sat in this stoop for a minute to listen ..
... and i thought why ruin the moment .
and when we finally got to your door
i started to tell you about my job
but you were distracted looking for your keys .
i couldn &apos;t stop staring
at that little cleft in your chin ..
... thinking about how i wanted to trace it with my finger ... and kiss you .
&apos;so i never told you about the job&apos;
and i called them the next day
and i told them that i didn &apos;t want it .
do you remember that night ?
yeah .
of course i remember that night .
that was one of the best .
can you please just open the door so we can talk ?
caleb , i really want to ..
... but i just need more time .
spence , maybe you should--
please don &apos;t .
wait here , okay ?
okay .
aria .
what ?
nothing , just ..
... just make sure you check the admitting area too , okay .
alison .
can i have some more olives before you punch out ?
as soon as we get aria &apos;s text , you ..
i drive rollins &apos; car to the train station
i use his credit card to purchase
57 one way , east bound .
as soon as the train pulls up to the station , i will step on .
i &apos;ll leave his jacket with his cellphone in the pocket
of a seat , i step off .
right , and while you &apos;re doing that
i &apos;ll be at alison &apos;s house packing up
rollins &apos; stuff into an overnight bag
making it look like he left in a hurry .
what is taking aria so long ?
she should have been done by now .
it &apos;s hanna , wondering if we should call aria .
just tell hanna to hang tight .
look . i know things are a little rocky with you and caleb
but you can &apos;t blame hanna .
she kissed him , em ..
... recently .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i didn &apos;t know that .
just remember , being back here
we &apos;ve all fallen into old patterns .
&apos;okay ? this entire night is proof of that.&apos;
i get it . okay ?
i know it &apos;s not always easy with an ex .
i mean ... when i saw yvonne &apos;s ring , i just ..
you know , even if you &apos;re happy for the person
there &apos;s just this , like , dull ache .
but i gave hanna years to figure out
if she wanted him back or not .
maybe it has nothing to do with hanna .
okay . maybe the timing was ... off .
i don &apos;t understand when people say that .
what is timing ?
timing is for figure skaters and comedians .
you either love someone or you don &apos;t .
are you coming ?
no .
might as well strengthen my alibi being the sad girl
at the end of the bar .
okay , well , i don &apos;t know what to say .
so , uh , good luck . break a leg .
how about ... knock &apos; em dead ?
alison ?
i thought i could go back in there , but i can &apos;t .
i know this is difficult ..
... but no one is gonna hurt you here .
rollins is gone .
if you don &apos;t go back up there ..
it &apos;s not just you and me .
everyone is counting on us .
you promise you &apos;ll come back for me .
i promise .
oh , sorry , i didn &apos;t order this .
i know . he did .
okay .
what are you doing ?
i thought we were--
if you leave me in these
i &apos;ll be trapped .
i know .
but the nurses have to see what he did to you .
they have to see that he was a monster .
i married that monster . how stupid am i ?
you &apos;re not stupid .
you were in love .
and he was in love with charlotte .
that &apos;s what the girl at the farm said , right ?
yeah .
but she also carried around a doll with no face .
after all those years that i fought for her to be released .
how could he think that i killed her ?
did you ?
did you kill her ?
i have to ask because ...
ezra and i thought we saw you that night
going into the church .
why do i still think that a lie
will sound better than the truth ?
i told charlotte about elliott and me that night .
we argued . she stormed out .
i followed her to the church , but i swear i didn &apos;t kill her .
i told you not to follow me .
you can &apos;t just wander around in the middle of the night .
the terms of your release were very clear .
what do you care what happens to me ?
you hooked up with my doctor .
that is not what happened .
please , can we just talk about this at home ?
no , all those times you came to the hospital ,
i thought you were there to see me .
i was .
we both cared about you .
that &apos;s what made elliott and me close .
he didn &apos;t do it on purpose . there &apos;s just ...
there &apos;s a point where we couldn &apos;t deny our connection .
i don &apos;t wanna hear any of this .
just go .
please , just leave me alone .
why didn &apos;t you tell the police what you saw ?
i was scared that they wouldn &apos;t believe me ,
that they &apos;d think that i killed her .
why wouldn &apos;t they ? you did .
the hardest part is knowing that if i hadn &apos;t left her
she would still be alive .
or you might not be .
i have to go .
i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
you &apos;re forgetting something . in the drawer .
you said that
you want them to see what kind of person he was .
are you sure ?
yeah .
put it on .
hi , i &apos;m marco .
ah , i &apos;m leaving .
well , that &apos;s a very unusual name .
sorry , i don &apos;t mean to be rude . i just ...
thank you for the drink .
i just should really get going soon .
okay .
well , soon is soon .
not same as now , is it ?
um , yeah .
guess i could stay for a minute .
good .
some extra olives for the lady please .
what ? i pay attention .
so , um ...
spencer .
spencer .
what were you doing tonight ?
burying a body .
maybe she &apos;s making it up .
i mean , it is alison we &apos;re talking about .
no , i &apos;m telling you , i don &apos;t think alison had anything
to do with charlotte getting killed .
well , we &apos;ve been wrong before .
are you sure we have everything ?
yeah , accelerant , lighters , gloves , goggles .
i think she &apos;s telling the truth .
besides , this isn &apos;t the same alison we knew at 15 .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t think i was the same person either ,
but look where we are .
oh , god , i used to be so scared of her .
this one time , she and i wore the same shirt
and i told the school nurse i was feeling flu @-@ ish
just so i could go home and change .
now , ali is the one who &apos;s scared .
she was practically shaking at the hospital .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t even look her in the eyes .
i felt too guilty .
hanna , she can never know that we were the ones--
aria ?
yeah .
we &apos;re missing something .
what ?
the car .
no . no , come on , that &apos;s an urban legend .
no way . it happened to my college girlfriend .
what ? oh , my god . what did she do ?
well , she couldn &apos;t tell him what it was now
or he &apos;d feel stupid
so she picked the piece up and ate it .
no . no way .
搞定了
lynn was ... she was a nice southern girl , you know ?
like , emily post was like a god to her .
she even graduated from charm school .
charm school ? that &apos;s like a thing ?
yeah . well , they don &apos;t call it that anymore .
i think it &apos;s called &quot; finishing school . &quot;
well , i think i &apos;m pretty finished , so ...
yeah ?
check please . thanks .
no , no , no . i got this .
come on . no , no , no .
this one &apos;s on me .
i may not have gone to charm school
but wouldn &apos;t want you to get the wrong idea .
what kind of wrong idea ?
stop . stop , stop .
what happened ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i just can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
tell me this is a nightmare .
it &apos;s gone .
no , it @-@ it can &apos;t be gone .
we must just be in the wrong place .
no , i remember covering it up
and putting it by the tree .
the tree ? hanna , look around you .
it &apos;s all trees . we &apos;re in a forest .
no , i put it by this tree
because it looked like one of those trees
that those @-@ those little men would live in .
hanna , just think , alright ?
are @-@ are you sure that we came in from this direction ?
you know , those little men with , like , the ears and ...
we &apos;ll be okay . we just ...
we need to retrace our steps , okay ?
keebler elves .
oh , my god .
i can &apos;t breathe . i can &apos;t breathe .
it &apos;s gotta be here . we just hid it really , really well .
we lost the car . we lost the damn car , aria .
hanna , cars don &apos;t just up and drive themselves .
you &apos;re right .
somebody else drove it .
somebody knows what we did tonight .
hey , i just left alison &apos;s house with elliott &apos;s bag .
do we wanna burn it or do we wanna throw it
in a dumpster outside of town ?
spencer .
em , i can &apos;t do my part .
i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t even drive .
where are you ?
what are we supposed to do now ?
call emily and spencer .
we have to pull the plug on this whole plan .
wait , really ? are you sure ?
well , when someone steals the car that you &apos;re about to torch
your cover @-@ up is kind of uncovered .
it &apos;s the car .
no way .
well , you two sure know how to ruin a surprise .
so how long have you been followi ng us ?
i wasn &apos;t following you ... specifically .
after hanna was targeted by &quot; a. &quot;
a.d.
&quot; uber a , &quot; whatever .
i started paying attention .
so when i heard ali had gone full @-@ blown &quot; girl interrupted &quot;
i got suspicious--
of rollins ?
i started trailing him as a precaution .
i put a gps tracker on his car
so when i saw it drive to the middle of the woods tonight
i decided to check it out . call it curiosity .
you know what that did to the cat , right ?
how did you find lucas &apos; car ?
it wasn &apos;t that hard .
you didn &apos;t exactly do a cracker @-@ jack job
of erasing the tire tracks .
and the bloody windshield told me the rest .
so do you make it a habit of inserting yourself
into other people &apos;s homicides or just ours ?
torching the car would have been a bonehead move .
why ? it would &apos;ve gotten rid of blood and fingerprints .
an abandoned car , scorched in the middle of woods
tends to raise some eyebrows .
okay . where did you get the windshield fixed ?
at a place that won &apos;t ask questions and doesn &apos;t give answers .
more importantly ,
what &apos;d you do with rollins &apos; burner phone ?
what burner phone ?
sit down here .
thanks .
his , uh , keys , did you remember to do something with them ?
i tossed them in the gutter .
and , and our fingerprints ?
it &apos;s on the handles .
did you--
took care of it .
okay . what about the--
how could do this to yourself ?
how could you do this to us ?
this could have ruined everything .
i know .
why would you go and lose control
on the one night when you needed it the most ?
you know , there ...
there were a few years where i really felt free .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t flinch anymore
when i saw somebody wearing a hoodie
or when i got a blocked call on my phone . i ..
i thought it &apos;s over , just really over , like for real .
i took horseback riding lessons .
i took a cooking class .
i even let friends tag me in photos .
and now , we &apos;re just ..
we &apos;re right back where we started .
it &apos;s worse . now i have aiding and abetting
and a failed relationship to add to the math .
here , drink .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry i screwed up so badly .
don &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s over .
if it makes you feel any better
we &apos;re all there with you .
right back at the beginning .
it doesn &apos;t make me feel any better .
drink more .
no , seriously , if i drink anything else
i &apos;m gonna be sick .
i know we need a cover ,
but maybe brunch was a bad idea .
what if your mom sees us ?
no , she &apos;s in new york this weekend .
besides , even if she wasn &apos;t
all we &apos;re doing is eating bagels .
and talking about burner phones .
how do we even know a burner phone exists ?
because i &apos;ve heard him on it .
it &apos;s the only time he drops that phony american accent .
does this record sound ?
no , just visuals .
what if we can &apos;t find the phone ?
we have to .
i &apos;ve never heard the other end of his calls .
we don &apos;t know who he &apos;s working with .
guys , i &apos;m sorry . i may be a little bit slow this morning
but yes , we do .
is there anyone here who thinks that it &apos;s not mary drake ?
i &apos;m sorry but are we comfortable with those visuals ?
us together on tape ?
look , after dealing with &quot; a &quot;
the only thing we know for sure is that
we can never be sure of anything .
i just think that we should--
aria , stop . drink your mimosa .
how do we get the phone ?
i can try to ping it .
see where it was used last .
if we &apos;re lucky , it might still be there .
okay , so bottom line , we find the phone
we find elliott &apos;s accomplice .
guys , it &apos;s mary drake , seriously .
who else could it possibly be ?
holy
shh .
hanna ? hanna marin ?
yeah , jenna , it &apos;s me .
i thought i heard your voice .
i could &apos;ve sworn i heard aria too .
hi , jenna .
oh , my god .
what are the chances ?
we &apos;re as surprised as you are .
mona .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re all here .
i knew it would be strange coming back
but i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d be taking a time machine .
they make those in a four @-@ door now ?
i see you haven &apos;t lost your sense of humor , spencer .
so what brings you back ?
toby &apos;s engagement .
a lot of our family came back to celebrate .
but you &apos;re staying at the radley ?
oh , didn &apos;t you hear ? my house blew up .
i heard that toby &apos;s not the only one
with wedding bells in his future .
so congratulations , hanna .
thank you .
um , how -- how did you ...
through the grapevine .
well , unfortunately , i have to get going .
tell ali i hope she feels better .
or maybe i &apos;ll go visit her .
return the favor from so long ago .
after running into all of you , i ...
i can &apos;t help but feel all nostalgic .
bye .
so the day after we run someone over
she comes tapping through town .
it &apos;s a co @-@ incidence .
there &apos;s no such thing .
co @-@ incidences are the devil &apos;s way of remaining anonymous .
i know it might be a little uncomfortable seeing her
but she could just be here for toby .
i know yvonne &apos;s family is in town .
i &apos;ll go get some more orange juice .
are you gonna stay mad at me forever ?
no .
but i do need to be mad at you for just like a bit longer .
so if you wanna be a good friend , then ...
just let me ...
let me be mad at you .
okay .
you should go see him .
let us find the burner phone .
but what am i supposed to say when he asks about last night ?
tell him the truth .
what about ...
maybe they &apos;ll be mad for a little while
but ... there are worse things .
go .
jenna .
what are you doing here ?
i came to say hello .
no , i mean what are you doing here in rosewood ?
i came to say hello .
i hear you &apos;re engaged .
does my dad know that you &apos;re here ?
no , not yet .
but you know i like to think of him as my dad too .
right , yeah , we &apos;re all one big happy family . i forgot .
i figured that now you &apos;re starting a family of your own
that ... it would be a good time to make amends .
yeah ?
i seem to remember we tried that
about three years ago
and it didn &apos;t go so well .
yeah , maybe not .
but i would really like to try again .
i can &apos;t do it .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s not possible .
i can hack into each cell tower &apos;s database
but unless i know the number , i can &apos;t --
you don &apos;t have to explain .
i won &apos;t understand anyway .
i &apos;m sorry . i really wanted to help you .
no , you have .
a lot .
these last couple of days have been ...
spencer was right .
there was time to stop
if i hadn &apos;t gotten the pedals mixed up .
no , look .
you got confused . it could happen to anyone .
i keep telling myself that it was an accident .
a horrible accident but ...
when i saw rollins ..
i just ...
i remember being in a cold , dark room .
so was i confused or ...
was i the least confused i &apos;ve ever been in my life ?
is that part of the confusion too ?
what do you mean ?
han , we used to spend weekends
browsing the tiffany &apos;s catalog .
you think i don &apos;t know a fake diamond
when i see one ?
jordan and i broke up .
but i &apos;m not ... telling anyone yet .
spencer and caleb are going through some stuff .
and you don &apos;t wanna be a factor .
but that &apos;s noble .
you can &apos;t hide this forever .
at some point , people are gonna expect , you know ...
... a wedding .
oh , my god , my bracelet .
i @-@ i had a gold chain bracelet on , and now it &apos;s not here .
well , when did you have it on last ?
last night in rollins &apos; car .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
oh , god . why -- why is this happening ?
if they find my bracelet in rollins &apos; car ...
they &apos;re not going to .
this is a lost cause .
they &apos;re never gonna let us in to see her .
probably not , just as long as they told her that we came .
we don &apos;t want alison to think that we &apos;re abandoning her .
he &apos;s only been missing a few hours .
why is the rosewood pd suddenly so motivated ?
because of me .
i asked toby to look into rollins , remember ?
great , you just sent the police
on a manhunt for the guy we just murdered .
hey . you both better come with me .
toby , what is going on ?
now .
caleb ?
caleb ?
what are you doing here ?
no need to call for the nurse , dear .
i &apos;m in charge now .
okay , enough with the secrecy already .
what &apos;s going on ?
we should wait for hanna .
uh , she can &apos;t come . she had plans with her mom .
toby ... what is it ?
i studied the file you gave me
but i couldn &apos;t find a connection
between mary drake and elliott rollins .
okay . so why were cops all over welby ?
elliott rollins is dead .
he &apos;s been dead for 15 years .
wait , what ?
when i ran elliott rollins &apos; name through our database ,
there were inconsistencies ,
so i looked into it .
the real dr. elliott rollins was 72 years old
when he died of a stroke .
so the guy alison married is ...
a fraud .
he &apos;s been using the identity of
the deceased dr. rollins
the whole time he &apos;s been working here .
and he must have realized that he was close
to being found out too because he &apos;s missing .
he didn &apos;t show up for work today .
he &apos;s not answering his phone .
he &apos;s gone .
d @-@ do you know where he is ?
not yet but we will find him .
i already spoke to my captain .
he &apos;s making it top priority .
good .
look , i @-@ i should probably go .
um , but ... in the meantime ,
please keep all of this to yourselves . okay ?
we won &apos;t say a word .
just , please be careful .
i don &apos;t know what this guy is capable of .
i promise you guys won &apos;t have to stay quiet for long .
the truth will come out .
whose genius idea was it to throw away the key ?
we should have told him .
we should have told him exactly what happened .
are you nuts ?
guys , if rollins isn &apos;t rollins ,
then who the hell did we just kill ?
all i found is a candy wrapper and a clump of hair .
are you sure it &apos;s in here ?
hey , hand me that lock thingy , will you ?
okay , but , hanna , we have to go ,
