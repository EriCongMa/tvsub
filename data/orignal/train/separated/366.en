Restoration
Yeah, sounds good, sounds good.
Don't put too much cheese on it.
Yeah, I'll be home in an hour.
Oh. Mr. Rango. We got here as fast as we could.
Sorry, kids, I'm leaving.
Oh, but Billy's gonna die if we don't get some candy.
You don't say?
Right here on the ground.
I think I might pass out.
He's turning red.
I think he needs a sugar rush.
Ok, all right, kid. You got 30 seconds.
Thank you. Good man!
Make it quick.
12 seconds! Let's go!
Come on.
You saved a life today, mr. Rango.
They should give you a medal of honor.
It's called dinner.
Let's go.
Let's go.
No! No...
Hey. I thought I'd lend you a hand.
Ah, Rossi. Brought a little something to drink.
I like that.
Well, you can't do renovation
without a little bevvy.
Wait a minute, now. You know I don't renovate.
I restore. There's a big difference.
I actually think there used to be some shutters here
once upon a time.
I'm hoping they're upstairs in the attic.
I want to see what I can do with them.
Well, why don't we start with a couple glasses?
That I can definitely do.
Flag on the play.
Yeah?
Ok, baby girl, we'll be right there.
E la vita.
So...
Two men have been killed on the southside of Chicago
in the last 10 days.
The first is Michael Crowley.
He was a repairman who was out jogging pretty late at night.
Second, Anthony Rango
he was a convenience store owner.
No known connection between them.
Both men were beaten to death with fists of fury.
Rango suffered a crushed larynx
and something called a Le Fort fracture?
It's a bilateral horizontal facial injury.
Looks like there was also
a blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
So they were blitz attacked to gain control,
then it was essentially fisticuffs.
And they were both literally caught with their pants down.
Like their jeans and their boxers
both down to their ankles.
But there's no sign of sexual assault or robbery.
So it was a message.
Either they led secret lives
or someone wanted to symbolically demean or embarrass them.
You can't really tell if it was done pre- or postmortem.
Aren't these your old stomping grounds?
We should go say hey to your family.
Yeah, I'm not gonna let anybody know I'm in town.
At least not until we're done with this.
I don't need any distractions.
With this level of hands-on violence,
this unsub is filled with rage.
And he's probably just getting started.
Wheels up in 30.
I am dead,
only vengeance can restore me.
Terry Goodkind.
All right, let's go over victimology.
Both of these men were medium-risk victims.
They were average Joes making a living
in a below average area.
The first victim, Crowley, was a telephone repairman
who'd living in the neighborhood for years.
Victim two, Rango,
owned a convenience store for about twice as long,
And he had pretty much the same routine every single day.
So each had a pattern.
It looks that way. They both had regular work hours.
Crowley's wife said he varied his workout route.
This was the first time that he ran this way.
He seems more like a victim of opportunity,
While the store owner's death seems planned.
The pants pulled down means the unsub's message is personal.
You know, 98% of the area is black,
But the two victims he attacked were white men
who'd lived in the neighborhood for years.
Maybe he wanted to shame them in some way.
This doesn't look like a hate crime.
Removing the pants is sexual, it's not racial.
Garcia, did you get any information
about the sexuality of the victims?
As far as I can tell, Rango was straight.
He was married 30 years, two grown kids.
No internet or credit card history suggests otherwise.
And what about the jogger?
If he was living on the DL,
I can't find the D or the L.
Somehow the unsub linked the two.
Morgan, you know the neighborhood.
You and Blake go to the minimart.
The rest of us will go to the P.D.
How far away from here did you grow up?
5 blocks. The park we just passed
is where I used to play football.
The bus stop on that corner--
That's where I played kissy-face
with my first girlfriend.
How old were you?
10.
Yeah. Our unsub blitz attacked the owner.
He must have regained consciousness
and put up a hell of a fight.
Yeah, it looks that way.
Baby girl, see if the owner of the convenience store
had any military defensive training.
Oh, I will, as long as you promise to bring me
some of my future mother-in-law's peach cobbler.
As soon as we're done here, I promise.
All right.
Wow, Mr. ESP,
Rango was an amateur MMA fighter
in the local "Over 50" division in his spare time.
He had a 10 and 1 record,
he was training for a big fight in June.
Tough old man. Thank you.
So we were right?
But to intentionally pick a fight with a martial artist?
Maybe our unsub didn't know?
Rango could have been the victim of opportunity,
like the jogger.
Well, it looks like our guy needed a drink after the beatdown.
He must have worn gloves,
otherwise CSI would have taken them in for the prints.
So he could have been an addict.
Maybe that explains the intensive nature.
You ever known an addict to leave a full register?
And this guy was mission oriented.
He even stole the disc before he left.
Candy and soda were the last things bought.
There were probably kids in here.
They're lucky they didn't get hurt.
Detective Gordinski.
Captain, actually.
I was promoted two years ago.
You remember Dr. Reid.
Ah, what's it been, 6, 7 years?
The number of pathogens passed during a handshake is staggering.
It's actually safer to kiss.
Ah, yeah, I do remember you.
Any developments in the investigation?
While you were in the air, another body dropped outside
a local diner on Halstead.
Guy's pants were pulled down, he was beaten to a pulp.
We had some team members headed to the morgue.
We'll redirect them to the diner instead.
Thank you.
Guy over there found him.
At first he thought he was homeless,
but then something didn't seem right.
Beaten to death wouldn't seem right whether he had a home or not.
Yeah, that's true.
Surveillance camera caught him eating with his son at the diner.
Then he passed the kid off to his mom and they took off.
This is odd. It's a high-traffic area.
The first two kills took place in seclusion.
The unsub is a highly motivated risk-taker.
What race was the victim?
African-american.
A change in M.O., too. He crossed the color line.
He's an equal opportunity killer.
Empty bottle of wine.
That's new.
What do you see?
Hey, what's up? You find anything in the alley?
Yeah, there's some writing on the dumpster.
What's it say?
Hold on a second.
They got something?
Do you see something?
Morgan.
"Look up to the sky"?
I gotta go.
Linguistically, it may mean
God judges the victim for his sins...
That's not it.
And taken in context, with the pants pulled--
Blake, that's not it.
Let's go.
Knock on every door.
Everyone gets overtime tonight. Ok?
Derek Morgan.
Where's Hotch?
He's in the conference room.
The M.E. found glass shards from a Helgeson Vineyards
wine bottle in the back of victim number 3's skull.
I know what this is about.
This is about Carl Buford.
What do you mean? Buford's in prison for life.
The words "look up to the sky"
were found in both the minimart and the alley.
It's what Buford used to say to me.
Look up to the sky!
Look up to the sky!
Look up to the sky!
Carl Buford was an expert.
At spotting and exploiting vulnerabilities
in adolescent boys that he coached at the community center.
He had the entire community thinking he was a hero.
Parents, teachers...cops.
I mean everyone.
After my dad died, he locked onto me.
And he manipulated me into compliant victimization.
Now, you remember how I told you that I got into it
with that local gangbanger when I was younger.
Well, somehow Buford got it all expunged.
Now, I didn't understand
why a guy who barely knew me would do that.
Buford gave me his time.
He taught me how to play football.
And then he took me to his cabin on the lake.
I was a kid.
I was a kid from the southside.
I'd never been to a cabin, much less a lake.
Morgan, you don't have to do this.
They need to know, Hotch.
They need to know this guy's M.O..
Buford built up my trust.
And then he would lower my inhibition with Helgeson wine.
He called it his Jesus juice.
Then he would molest me.
And every time he would see that dead look in my eyes
that said I wanted him to stop...
He would just say, "You better man up, boy."
"Look up to the sky."
Did you ever tell anyone about that phrase?
No.
We're probably looking at someone who Buford abused.
The victim could harbor a great deal of anger
if he didn't deal with his own abuse.
And with the right trigger,
it could develop into this kind of rage.
Where's Buford now?
We got him locked up for homicide in 2006,
but because of the statute of limitations,
we never got him for molestation.
Buford ran the community center for years.
An offender like him could have hundreds of victims.
All right, let's talk about victimology.
Each of these men had had interactions with kids
right before they were killed.
The killer switched from white victims to African-Americans.
You'd think that if they were surrogates for Buford,
he'd kill only black men.
Hello? Garcia, I need you to compile a list
of all of the boys who played football at the community center
20-30 years ago.
OK.
I knew about Buford molesting Morgan,
but there were more kids?
Preferential offenders typically have dozens of victims.
And each reacts differently.
Morgan became an FBI agent and this one went the other way.
You know, had I known back in the day
that Morgan was going through all this,
I wouldn't have arrested him 6 years ago.
And I sure wouldn't have been so hard on him as a kid.
I know.
Let us go deliver the profile
and stop this guy from killing anybody else.
The man that we're looking for is an AfricanAmerican male
in his late 30s to early 40s, and he's from this area.
He most likely attended
the local community center as a youth.
He's athletic and he's powerful,
which explains his ability
to overcome his victims with aggression.
His perfect timing and selection
say his intelligence level is high,
and his victim selection shows us his murders
are not planned in advance.
He may have a drinking problem,
which makes him more unpredictable
and exacerbates his anger.
Come on, now, I'm his father!
The fact that he doesn't steal from his victims
shows us that he's mission oriented.
This says that the substance abuse is a coping mechanism,
from the fact that he never
adequately dealt with his own victimization.
By exposing his victims and scrawling the phrase
Buford used during his sexual assaults
at the crime scenes,
he's telling the world that he sees the victims
as child molesters,
which is his justification for killing them.
This is an example of projection and polarization,
a black-and-white thinking
which when coupled with impulsivity, anger,
and outbursts of violence indicates
that this unsub's most likely suffering from an extreme case
of borderline personality disorder.
BPD is one of the most common
mental disorders suffered by adults
who were victimized as children.
This represents the borderline between anxiety and psychosis.
We believe this unsub's perspective has become so warped
that he's likely experiencing stress-related paranoid ideation,
most likely brought on by a recent traumatic event
that triggered that rage.
No!
He's killing men just after
they innocently interact with children.
So step up patrols in parks,
schools, ball fields, even family events.
But do not try to confront this man alone.
We believe that he is armed and extremely dangerous.
Thank you.
Go ahead, Garcia.
I'm gonna start with the good news first 'cause I wanna.
The renamed Damien Walters Community Center is thriving
under its new director,
Ms. Walters, Damien's mom.
The bad news is, although they now computerize their records,
back when Buford ran the joint
it was all paper files, so I'm out of luck there.
All right, thanks, Garcia.
JJ, why don't you get Reid
and go over to the center, dive into those files,
see if you can come up with a comprehensive list
of Buford's potential victims.
I actually know one of them personally.
His name is James Barfield.
He's a senior at Northwestern.
I might be able to get something out of him.
Ok. You and Blake go over there,
see what you can find out.
Derek Morgan just called to give me a heads-up.
The records are in the back.
Thanks.
You know, community centers
are supposed to bring people together,
but this one has torn enough people apart.
I'll be up front, if you need anything.
Thank you.
I hear they're talking first round, huh?
Oh, snap.
Derek Morgan.
That's right.
What are you doing here, Derek?
Mr. FBI ain't come to wish me luck.
Carl Buford.
Hey, man, you need to leave that alone.
Someone's killing men in our old neighborhood.
What else is new?
Well, because of certain evidence found at the crime scenes,
we believe it's one of Buford's former victims.
You told her?
James, we just need to figure out who's doing this.
You should be hitting the pavement figuring it out,
not wasting time talking to me.
James, you're not a suspect.
We just need to identify the other men.
Look, did Buford ever mention any special guys,
guys closer to my age?
I can't help you.
If we don't get a list of names,
someone else could lose their life.
Is that really what you want?
Let me break this down for you, J. Crew.
I ain't no snitch. I'm not telling you
what another man's gone through.
James, just give us some names and nobody has to know about this.
I'm not starting my football career
carrying that mess around.
I'm about to get out of these streets.
I'm not doing it, Derek.
All right, Dr. Genius, do you notice anything I'm not seeing?
Between travel receipts, letters of recommendation, and expense reports,
I've compiled a list of several names,
but it's obvious there are gaps in the records.
Do you think Buford
destroyed some files before he went to prison?
Given the opportunity, most people in his situation would have.
We should probably call the team with this.
Hotch, James couldn't give us any names.
Reid and JJ were only able to come up with a partial list
from the files at the community center,
so we'll talk to those guys,
we'll see if anybody stands out
or if they can fill in the gaps.
It could take days or weeks to track them down.
I need to go see Buford.
I want you to try something with JJ first.
All right, Derek,
I just need you to relax.
Just try to remember.
JJ, come on,
I taught you the "You're in a safe place now" speech.
Well, I should be pretty damn good at it.
All right.
So I need you to think back
to the sights and sounds and smells of playing football.
We were some sweaty, dirty, smelly kids back then.
All we ever wanted to do was to get out there and play the game.
Was Buford there?
Yeah.
Did you notice any unusual glances
or behavior between him and any of the other boys?
No.
Buford never took his eyes off of me.
Come on, Derek, focus, focus.
Did you notice if any of the boys avoided him subtly?
Good job, D. That's my boy.
Nothing.
I had always thought I was the only one.
JJ, this isn't working. I'm done.
I don't want you going to see Buford.
Hotch, I can handle it.
Another man was found beaten to death.
Same M.O. 10 blocks from the last murder.
That's 4 in two weeks.
And take Blake with you.
Hotch, come on. We gotta do this now.
I finished my counseling two years ago.
I can do this.
All right, but I'm coming with you.
All these years
I kept my mouth shut.
Carl Buford, my mentor.
Look at you. You'd probably be dead by now.
Yeah, well, it wasn't for free, was it?
I pulled you out of the gutter.
I pulled myself out of the gutter,
all the way to the FBI. I did that!
You saying I had nothing to do with making you who you are?
No, Carl.
Actually, I'm saying you have everything to do with making me who I am.
Open gate.
Close gate.
Derek Morgan.
Got yourself a new look, huh?
I'm Mohammed Alam now.
Of all my boys, you're the last one
that I thought would come back to me.
4 men have been killed in the old neighborhood, Carl.
Allah view murder as a sin and an abomination.
At each crime scene the words "Look up to the sky" were found.
You remember those words.
They escape me.
I've been very busy filling my brain with knowledge.
I'm a Malcolm X islamic scholar now.
I know you remember that cabin.
And me and every other boy
that you took up there remembers it, too.
The man you harbor so much rage for is no longer here.
Yes, he is.
He's sitting right in front of me.
You're just hiding behind a religion that hasn't figured you out yet.
Still got that mouth on you, don't you?
Always liked that mouth.
You were always direct.
Whenever I see you on TV,
I tell everyone that's my boy.
I'm proud of you.
I don't give a damn how you feel.
You see, what I need
is a list of everyone you've victimized.
You still like mint chocolate-chip ice cream?
The U.S. Attorney has offered immunity.
They won't charge you with molesting any of the boys on this list
as long as this list is complete.
Or was it butter pecan?
You leave even one name off that list, this deal is dead.
Are you threatening me, D.?
With my hand on the Qu'ran.
See, right now, you're in here for serial murder.
And I bet that gives you a whole lot of credit out there in the yard. Am I right?
But what do you think would happen if the brothers in here
learned what you were really guilty of?
So let me be direct,
Mohammed.
Start writing.
Some people are easy to remember,
but others sort of fade to the background.
That doesn't mean they weren't special.
They just weren't like you, Derek.
I'll give you the list on one condition.
All I want is a handshake. That's it.
A gentleman's agreement.
What do you say?
You were always special, Derek.
You may have me in here,
but there's a whole lot more of me out there, boy.
You didn't have to shake his hand.
It's a long list, Hotch.
This unsub's devolving.
He'll stand out. He won't be hard to find.
I'm gonna use the head before we leave.
I have arrested every one of these kids.
I never once thought they were getting molested.
Some victims of sexual abuse
tell their parents and others act out.
I cross-referenced the list of special kids from the center
with the list of victims Morgan got from Buford.
I've come up with a half a dozen names
of people who fit the profile and the physicality to be suspects.
Did you get that list to Garcia?
She's pulling their histories right now.
Yeah, baby girl, how's that list coming along?
Ok. Of the 5 that fit the profile,
one sticks out like a tiger in a room of kittens.
What name's that?
Keron Bender.
He's a former linebacker.
He was on Buford's community center team.
He's a few years older than Derek. He's come upon hard times.
By that I mean he has 3 arrests for domestic violence,
two for meth possession and aggravated assault,
and he lives smack in the middle of the kill zone.
Send that address right now. Let's go.
Sent.
Police!
I got him!
Weed, it's just weed. It's just weed.
I told you, I don't know nobody.
I just want you to look at this list.
All right? Just look at it.
Are there any other guys around our age who aren't on here who
Buford treated as special?
Well, how am I supposed to know?
You tryin' to kick a brother when he down.
Buford used to tell you to look up to the sky, right?
I need your help.
Just look at the list.
I recognize a few of those guys.
But there was older ones, though,
before that.
At the center.
No.
Cabrini Green.
Buford used to live there before--
He was tight with the king cobras.
He used to tell their moms
that he would keep them off the streets.
Yeah. I used to bump heads with a few of them.
You got any names?
Yeah.
There was one.
He was Buford's favorite.
Who?
Pretty sure his name was Rodney.
Rodney Harris?
Yeah.
He got it the worst.
Rodney's not on this list.
Buford played us.
He was one of the biggest drug dealers
in the neighborhood 6 years ago.
Yeah, but he fell out. He's not running that anymore.
Rodney's the one you had all the trouble with, right?
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
This is all starting to make sense now.
Buford probably let him deal drugs close to the center
just to keep him quiet about what Buford had done.
And Rodney looked at you and saw everything he could have been.
Yeah, but what made him snap now?
Yeah, Garcia, see if there's a connection between Rodney Harris
and any of our victims.
I already did that, babe, and I'm coming up empty.
What about Rodney's extended family?
There's a connection.
Ok, uh, Michael Crowley-- he's the first victim--
he was a swim coach to Tyler Harris.
That's Rodney's estranged son.
So Sheila, Rodney's ex-wife,
pulled Tyler from the swim team.
Turns out she made quite a scene, rightfully so,
because...
Crowley had molested him after a swim meet.
So Crowley was killed out of revenge.
Rango and the others, who had simple interaction with children,
were just surrogates for Carl Buford.
You got an address for Rodney?
I traced Rodney's cell phone
and it's pinging at the current address of Sheila Goode.
That's Rodney's ex-wife.
Yeah, but why would you spend that kind of money
on something like that?
It's your money.
I love it.
Don't you move.
Oh, my god.
Rodney...
Shut up!
Shut up!
What are you doing?
Shut up!
Why?!
Move back.
Come here, Tyler.
Rodney, what's wrong with you?
You gonna go and be with him?
With him? You--
Oh! Rodney, what's the hell's wrong with you?!
Dad, please!
I just saved you, boy.
What did you do, Rodney?!
Shut up!
What did you do?!
You sure?
Yeah.
He's agitated.
Rossi, you guys take the back.
Rodney, please don't do this.
Rodney, I'm coming in!
Rodney?
Get out of here, Derek.
I can't do that.
I will kill him.
You kill him, you die.
He's innocent.
He took my family.
He didn't protect my son.
That's not true.
It is!
Rodney, this has nothing to do with him.
This is about what happened to you.
What?
Carl Buford.
I know what he did to you back in the day.
Son of a bitch.
Son of-- you don't know me.
You don't know what I've been through.
You better back up or I will kill him.
Oh, Rodney, please.
You shut up.
Rodney!
This is all your fault, anyway.
You took my son away from me.
You can't keep killing people, man.
What happened to your son was wrong.
But it brought you back to what Buford did to you, didn't it?
Look, I know exactly what you're feeling,
because I've been there.
How I'm feeling?
You have no idea how I'm feeling.
You're just a bitch-ass narc.
I'm in these streets.
Hell, I'm already dead.
No!
No, that's what Carl Buford always wanted you to believe.
Don't you see that? That's how he controlled you.
And if you pull that trigger, he wins.
No, Buford ain't got nothin' on me.
I know he molested you.
Nah.
Man, stop talking.
Why didn't you tell me, Rodney?
Just stop talkin'.
Why didn't you tell me?
Shut up! Shut your mouth.
Rodney, look at me.
He did the same thing to me.
I confronted him.
I got him locked away for life.
He's done.
Done?
Done ain't good enough.
Look at your son.
Look at him.
Don't go out like this in front of him.
You don't want to destroy his life, too, do you?
Rodney, he loves you.
I do, dad.
He still needs you.
He still needs you, Rodney.
Rodney...
Put that gun down.
You know, the only reason I became a cop
was so I could tell right from wrong.
Get bad off the streets, only the good was standing.
But I got it wrong.
Not just with you but with all these kids.
I...made assumptions about who they were,
why they did what they did.
People like Buford I let slide.
I'm sorry.
What drove you to kill those men?
Clear the way, please.
Is it true that this is all about Carl Buford?
Why did you do it?
Comment, please!
You don't have to do this. I got it.
Derek, I got it.
I used to think that, uh, Carl Buford was a hero.
6 years ago I found out I was very wrong.
Derek.
It's over.
You did it.
You're saying that's why Rodney Harris killed those men?
Yes, that's what I said.
So being abused made him a killer?
No.
No, it did not.
The vast majority of child sex victims
don't grow up to be sex offenders or criminals.
I know this because...
And let me be direct...
I was also one of Carl Buford's victims.
Yo, Mohammed, wasn't "Carl Buford" your government name?
Victimization does not cause offending.
Yeah. I don't know what he's talking about.
I loved that kid.
It can cause a lot of isolation...
And there can be anger and rage.
It can cause pain and suffering...
But you can get through it.
It can make you stronger.
It does not have to destroy your life.
It can make you fight back.
And it can make you want to spend the rest of your life protecting others.
What is that, Morgan?
It's my mom's peach cobbler.
Garcia's gonna be a happy woman.
You didn't save us any?
Oh, come on, there's enough for everybody.
We'll heat it up when we get back.
Derek.
You did a great thing back there.
I appreciate all of you for having my back.
Yeah, this is Derek Morgan.
When?
All right.
Thanks for the call.
What happened?
Carl Buford is dead.
"For darkness restores what light cannot repair."
