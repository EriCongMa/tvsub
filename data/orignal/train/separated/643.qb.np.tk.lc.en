this is amazing .
you cannot go into business with these people .
they are looking out for me .
you will regret this .
this is ... war .
good luck on the big move with margaux .
i &apos;m not so sure that &apos;s gonna happen anymore .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re gonna make it .
i have everything handled . there won &apos;t be any fallout .
you recorded our conversations .
i control you .
how do you know my father ?
he came to me with the story about planting that bomb .
the second i gave pascal that story ,
i knew i &apos;d made a mistake .
he killed your father .
we need you to come forward .
i &apos;ll do whatever you need .
pascal has already paid a visit to mr. chapman .
you &apos;re next unless i run interference for you .
none of this was chance .
it was emily . it &apos;s revenge ...
for david .
a revolution begins when the desires of many
are addressed by the actions of one .
it &apos;s a ripple of change
that starts when the first stone is cast at those in power
and only ends when one side lies defeated ...
or if two sides become one .
since our last meeting , you seem to be avoiding me ,
mr. mathis .
i &apos;ll let you know when i have what you need .
oh , well , when will that be ?
&apos;cause as i do my part to keep pascal on his heels
by besting him in business ,
you seem more interested in abandoned midtown buildings
than the task at hand .
well , i have other interests that don &apos;t involve you .
not right now you don &apos;t .
or were the photographs of oscar &apos;s dead body
not enough to compel you ?
if you &apos;re so eager ,
why don &apos;t you take care of pascal yourself ?
i don &apos;t even get my hands dirty when driving .
you have one day
before i alert pascal to your presence .
unless , like oscar chapman ,
you want to flee and life your life as a woman .
you &apos;re certainly acting like one .
i &apos;m beginning to understand
why emily went through with that wedding .
what happened on the honeymoon boat was to be my downfall .
i can only imagine what her next desperate attempt will be .
i won &apos;t give her that chance .
i told you i don &apos;t want you involved with her in any way .
i agree .
there is something i would like to ask you .
actually , i should have asked you this a long time ago .
will you marry me ?
would you like to be my wife ?
yes , pascal .
yes !
yes ?
yes .
what about rebecca devereaux ?
zbornak ? nylund .
i just want you to be golden , girl .
get serious , nolan .
i &apos;m trying to give you time to reconsider
since taking conrad down like this is a huge risk .
it won &apos;t be if we &apos;re prepared .
i cannot believe that daniel got javier to mac @-@ stab me .
have you seen the guest list for the myclone launch tomorrow ?
hey . you &apos;re late . is the space ready ?
no , i had to find a new one
as conrad cornered me at the original location ...
and gave me an ultimatum --
take care of pascal , or he &apos;ll reveal me .
then let &apos;s take control of the situation .
what shall we do with the day ?
there &apos;s a beautiful vineyard at the north fork
i &apos;ve been wanting to visit .
mm @-@ hmm . i have a meeting in the city .
but after that , i &apos;m all yours .
take it easy , you crazy kids .
i still can &apos;t believe you &apos;re engaged .
oh , yes . i believe it .
where are you thinking of holding the ceremony ?
he won &apos;t tell me , but i think it &apos;s corsica .
it is corsica , right ?
i won &apos;t tell you .
hey , all goes well with the myclone debut tomorrow ,
we &apos;ll build you a chateaux there with the profits .
i &apos;m impressed , daniel .
your program is perfect for lemarchal &apos;s expansion into social media .
great job .
margaux , your father tells me that he has big plans for you .
oh , at least he has told the news to someone .
i spoke to gideon this morning .
he still thinks he &apos;s in line for your job .
patience , sweetheart . patience .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m stepping down tomorrow .
okay , here &apos;s ...
to things worth the wait .
thank you .
come with me , lemarchal .
who are you ?
the man who &apos;s detaining you .
miss thorne .
no . agent rebecca stone , homeland security .
this is where you tell me everything .
for three years now , i &apos;ve been undercover
building a case against the graysons --
money laundering , murder ...
terrorism .
and you have the information that i need to close my case .
i want to talk to my lawyer .
under section 412 of the patriot act ,
i &apos;m under no legal obligation to provide you with counsel .
i always knew you were up to something .
the feeling &apos;s mutual .
so why don &apos;t you make this easy on yourself ?
what do you have on the graysons ?
i have nothing to say .
ill @-@ advised .
but fine . i &apos;ll start with your phone .
mom ?
charlotte ? what &apos;s wrong ?
some freak just sent me this .
&quot; you &apos;re so much like your namesake , it &apos;s almost haunting .
&quot; and i know i said this before ,
but the day you became a clarke was one of my proudest moments . &quot;
there &apos;s no signature .
and what what does that mean -- &quot; i said this before &quot; ?
i haven &apos;t the foggiest . someone who &apos;s trying to scare you ?
i don &apos;t know , mom .
amanda once showed me some journals that david wrote .
and the handwriting is similar .
is there any chance david is still alive ?
charlotte ...
history has proved that there are always people out there
who enjoy haunting this family
with the specter of david clarke .
but that letter seems so sincere .
darling , don &apos;t let your imagination run wild ...
especially when there are far lovelier things to think about .
you &apos;re engaged .
that was fast .
i hope one day your heart knows such certainty .
oh , sweetie .
congratulations .
so you see why we shouldn &apos;t let anything rattle us ?
give me that . i &apos;ll get rid of it .
no .
i don &apos;t want you to spend another second
with such an evil prank .
dude has ice in his veins .
i guess that &apos;s why he had no trouble
shooting oscar at point @-@ blank range .
that &apos;s something that we have to carry , too , nolan .
neither of you pulled that trigger .
pascal &apos;s the one who has to pay .
well , everything &apos;s loaded . now what ?
access any audio or video from the last few days ,
since that &apos;s when conrad contacted me .
once pascal rolls on conrad , conrad will roll on victoria .
we &apos;ll have them dead their rights . there .
i have everything handled . there won &apos;t be any fallout .
just stay calm , and it &apos;ll all be fine .
but they are in big trouble .
daniel and gideon are kids .
trust me -- the last thing prince rainier wants
is to alienate the graysons and the lemarchals
over a raided wet bar .
damn it . this has nothing to do with flight 197 .
pascal was bluffing .
conrad doesn &apos;t know that .
i need you to get me something .
you here for your sour grapes ?
mm , no , i heard the news .
you know , i thought that your imminent departure
would bring me solace .
but oddly , there &apos;s another sensation
kicking around inside of me .
a burst appendix , i hope .
no , something far more concerning .
it &apos;s a bizarre impulse to protect you .
you know , it seems as if your mission
is to stop by weekly like the gardener
to convince me that pascal is a weed .
if i didn &apos;t know better ,
i would think that you were still in love with me .
and i was once , victoria .
as pascal is now .
is he ?
after trying to force my compliance to his demands ,
he needs to make certain that you are legally incapable
of corroborating my testimony about him .
i assure you that is not the case .
why don &apos;t you ask oscar chapman ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s the man your fiance killed in the city yesterday
to save his own skin .
or did he not tell you that before he proposed ?
if you ever set foot in this house again ,
i will have you arrested for trespassing .
oh , from what i hear , you won &apos;t be around to make that happen .
you will make a beautiful bride , victoria .
i only wish the vows of matrimony
didn &apos;t lead once more to your being a miserable wife .
did margaux send you for her stuff ?
&apos;cause i haven &apos;t boxed it up yet .
no .
but , jack , i am so sorry .
i never meant for that to happen .
yeah , well , it had to ...
with or without your brother &apos;s meddling .
what brings you by ?
you &apos;re gonna think i &apos;m crazy .
who wrote this ?
i have a guess .
it can &apos;t be david .
well , amanda had some journals with his handwriting ,
so it can &apos;t hurt to check , right ?
charlotte , your father is dead .
this is obviously just some jerk messing with your head .
yeah , my mother said the same thing .
and then i found these in her vanity ...
two more letters .
why would she hide them and then lie to my face about it ?
who knows why she does anything ?
please , can i just see the journals ?
i don &apos;t know what amanda showed you , but i don &apos;t have anything .
then i guess i &apos;ll have to confront my mom about it ,
because ... i just have this feeling .
hang on .
i think i can help you .
it &apos;s a shame we never got to play poker .
i would have known you were bluffing .
but conrad obviously took the bait .
which means you have nothing .
except an exact timeline of your guilt .
your initial investment in grayson global .
you made millions off of that bombing just like conrad .
what do you do to protect it ?
you kill trevor mathis .
we have confirmation that you wrote that .
wrote what ? some meaningless letters ?
not to oscar chapman .
but , of course ...
you know that .
you killed him to keep him from talking .
well ... it &apos;s circumstantial .
it &apos;s enough to detain you indefinitely !
maybe margaux will be a little bit more forthcoming .
margaux knows nothing .
oh , really ?
she &apos;s been digging around for information on flight 197
since she got here .
either you cooperate , or i &apos;m going after her .
what do you want , huh ?
what i &apos;ve wanted from the beginning ...
the graysons .
you &apos;ll wear this wire to the myclone launch ...
where i will watch your every move
until you get a confession from conrad and victoria ,
at which point , in return ,
you &apos;ll leave this country a free man .
i &apos;ll give you conrad . no problem .
we need victoria , too .
no .
all right .
i &apos;ll give you victoria .
but you breathe a word of this to her , and , i swear to god ,
you will never again see the light of day .
what should i do if plans change ?
call this number .
otherwise , my associate will pick you up outside your office
30 minutes before the launch and prep you .
understand ?
good .
how was your meeting in the city ?
waste of time .
were these the same people you met the other afternoon ?
why all the questions ?
i &apos;m just asking you about your day .
i &apos;ve had it with this country .
and i &apos;m needed back in paris .
we leave tomorrow night after the event .
is there something on your mind , pascal ?
i &apos;m gonna take a shower .
and then maybe ... we can discuss flights .
you &apos;ve reached the office of agent rebecca stone ,
homeland security .
please leave a message .
once he &apos;s wired , tell him to get conrad into the v.i.p suite
where it &apos;ll be quiet .
after pascal gets a confession ,
i &apos;ll bring him back down to you .
all those years thinking my father had killed himself ,
only to be that close to pascal today .
i know .
but just imagine his shock
when he figures out he &apos;s been played .
you know restraint is not my strong suit .
as of tomorrow night , he &apos;s all yours .
do whatever you want with him .
i think pascal is talking to homeland security .
what ? where is he now ?
he said he had more business to do in the city
and that he would meet me at your launch tomorrow
and , after that , we would leave the country .
sounds like he has something planned .
i wonder if my ruse with my friend at interpol
accidentally tipped the feds off .
your ruse at interpol ? what are you talking about ?
i needed my magazine back ,
so i had him threaten pascal , okay ?
in doing so , you may have put pascal in an untenable position !
i &apos;m not the bad guy here !
i put such faith in him .
i can &apos;t believe that he would talk to the authorities
without telling me .
is he using me ?
no .
i mean , i &apos;m sure he &apos;d never betray you .
besides , the only person he has to offer up is dad , right ?
and you really think that pascal &apos;s gonna come through ?
ah , so help me , but ...
i think he is actually motivated by a love for victoria ,
which only confirms that i will never understand the french .
yeah . i learned that the hard way .
i &apos;m so sorry about margaux .
it &apos;s better now than later , i guess .
well , at least you brought charlotte back into the fold .
yeah , well , think of it as my way of mending fences
and of not losing every woman in my life to daniel grayson .
anything ?
digital stamp from a local post office
leaves more footprints than the pony express .
and this one tracks to ...
kurt renner ?
lives in a cabin in the middle of the berkshires .
that &apos;s great , nolan . thank you .
seriously ? you &apos;re not gonna tell me what this is about ?
trust me . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not worth your time .
daniel !
we &apos;ve got a problem .
pascal has been talking to the feds .
desperate man taking desperate measures .
must have got himself snared for his most recent crime .
so he &apos;s trying to save his neck .
but with what ?
well , for starters , evidence he has on me
that i &apos;ve tried unsuccessfully to retrieve .
but if i &apos;m still a free man , it &apos;s obviously not enough .
you coming to the launch tomorrow night ?
well , seeing as i now have sizable media holdings ,
it wouldn &apos;t do to miss it .
i think that &apos;s where pascal plans to drop the hammer .
i &apos;ve arranged for my friend over at interpol to be standing by
to extradite him back to france for cooking &quot; voulez &apos;s &quot; books .
oh , and you need me to get him to the airport
because you can &apos;t absent yourself from your own event .
well , if he &apos;s gunning for you ,
he &apos;ll have to follow wherever you go .
i mean , the suits over at homeland security
won &apos;t be prepared for that .
uh , you know , this won &apos;t sit well with your mother .
she &apos;s gonna accuse you of betraying her .
please . she was the one who was foolish enough to trust him .
besides , there &apos;s many upsides to getting rid of pascal .
everything set for the launch tonight ?
first , my father says a few words ,
and then we hand over the program to javier .
i , uh -- i know it &apos;s pascal &apos;s company , but ...
this was our acquisition .
what -- you don &apos;t think he should speak ?
well , i just think it &apos;s a good time
to establish a precedent by letting you lead .
and to that point , i know he promised you his job ,
but you should get it in writing .
why ?
do you know something i don &apos;t ?
well , just that my mother said he wants to leave tonight
on the first of many vacations with her .
if pascal stops running the day @-@ to @-@ day at lemarchal ,
it could create a power vacuum back in paris .
where gideon can sweep in and take advantage .
yeah , margaux ...
we are about to launch a product
that will fundamentally alter the landscape of this company .
so why shouldn &apos;t your father commit to you
before your brother has a chance to change his mind ?
hello ?
are you sure this is the right address ?
county registrar &apos;s office said there &apos;s no kurt renner
or anyone living here .
well , someone does .
someone who obviously wants to keep their identity hidden .
don &apos;t jump to any conclusions .
i &apos;m trying not to , but it &apos;s hard .
charlotte ...
david clarke died in front of 100 inmates .
and even if they were all wrong ,
why would he wait until now to reach out to his daughter ?
maybe he was afraid .
this is the same stationary used in those letters .
yeah , but the rest is research .
david knew all this information .
he wouldn &apos;t need to do any of this .
so , this really is just some sicko trying to mess with me .
i &apos;m sorry .
let &apos;s go before he comes home .
so , it is true . you &apos;re leaving tonight ?
yes . my business here is done .
yours , yes , but not mine .
you &apos;ve been looking for a foothold
into social networking for years .
myclone will be that for our company .
i &apos;m glad you saw its potential .
what are you getting at , margaux ?
well , you say that i am the next generation of lemarchal media .
but yet i fear that once you &apos;re home ,
gideon will do anything to sway you .
don &apos;t worry . my mind is made up .
well , then , put it in writing --
a formal contract making me the next c.e.o.
all right .
i &apos;ll have the papers drawn up .
thank you , papa .
let &apos;s have a drink at the rutherford before the event
to celebrate .
i have things to do .
sure .
but i love you , sweetheart .
and i know you &apos;ll do a great job .
nolan ross .
your name &apos;s not on the list .
how about on the hardware ?
i &apos;d say that makes me a permanent plus @-@ one .
oh , millennials .
if only he understood how well i know this guest list .
surprised to see you at my party .
i am still the master of this universe .
so if you want to be in my orbit , where else would i be ?
ross , if you &apos;re quite finished playing
&quot; who &apos;s got the bigger hard drive , &quot;
i have an update for you both .
excuse us .
pleasure .
pascal is wired , transmitting , and en route .
let &apos;s just hope he sticks to the plan .
oh , he will .
victoria &apos;s exactly the leverage we needed .
i thought i was going to have to navigate this event alone .
what kept you ?
i &apos;m sorry for making you wait .
is there something you need to tell me , pascal ?
let &apos;s begin our life away from here now .
we can leave the party ... take the plane to corsica .
i can &apos;t .
we must .
i love you .
you do believe me , don &apos;t you ?
i do .
i &apos;ll see you later .
looks like happily ever after .
i know we &apos;ve had our differences , but ...
it seems like you &apos;re actually getting what you deserve .
congratulations , victoria .
welcome , all .
this is a big moment for my company ,
and also for my family .
tonight , i am very happy
to announce that my daughter , margaux ,
will be my successor at lemarchal media .
i also give the stage to her .
so , please welcome margaux lemarchal .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
merci , papa .
so , tonight ,
my partner , daniel grayson , and i invite you to witness
the next revolution in personalized technology .
so , what if an app knew you better than you know yourself ?
what if it could ...
anticipate your desires and help others fulfill them ?
well , today , &quot; what if &quot; becomes &quot; what you can &apos;t live without . &quot;
and to tell you more ,
i &apos;d like to introduce you to the architect of myclone .
ladies and gentlemen , the remarkable javier salgado .
myclone is a hyper @-@ personalized search engine
and social @-@ media hub gathering data
to re @-@ create the person themselves .
on the outside ...
... and inside .
hey , charlotte .
hi , javier .
so , my girlfriend really wanted to be here tonight .
but since she couldn &apos;t ,
you all get to see the power of myclone .
hey , babe . what do you want to do for your next birthday ?
that &apos;s easy -- to get high and party .
high on life , i &apos;m sure .
uh , let &apos;s -- let &apos;s take it to one of our guests .
you . would you tell everybody your name ?
kristiana rubins .
well , myclone has already done voice , name , facial recognition
and is now pulling from every database in the world
to create ... you .
we &apos;d like to send you anywhere on our dime .
mm @-@ hmm . so , let &apos;s plan your dream trip .
where do you want to go ?
sarajevo -- there &apos;s a flight leaving jfk in 12 hours
with a connection in munich .
sounds exotic .
should we book it ?
is this some kind of sick joke ?
my family was massacred there when i was 9 .
i barely escaped with my life .
um , our most sincere apologies .
like any prototype , there are glitches to iron out .
well , i tried to tell javier myclone wasn &apos;t ready .
so i manipulated the data dumps ...
... for every single person here to show him .
nice .
he &apos;ll have another one .
yes , sir .
same for me .
will this round come with another obscure threat ?
i no longer want to play games
with people who should be my allies .
oh , i &apos;m glad to see you &apos;ve come to your senses .
i was just on my way out .
i &apos;ll make it worth your while .
well , then , walk with me .
what the hell was that ?
it was probably nolan .
he &apos;s the only person that &apos;s smart enough to pull this off .
i thought we were paying you to be best .
you are . i &apos;ll fix it .
no , you won &apos;t .
no . you see , we own the program now .
we don &apos;t need you to make it a success .
you &apos;re out .
okay . no , no , no .
your performance out there was the only reason
we won &apos;t take a dive in the market tomorrow .
still , i mean -- - hey , hey , hey . no .
what happened out there had nolan ross all over it .
but if he &apos;s stupid enough
to sabotage his former protege &apos;s launch ,
it gives us instant credibility when we let the world know .
okay ?
wait . pascal &apos;s headed in the wrong direction .
you think he &apos;s gonna sell us out ?
i &apos;m not gonna let him .
aiden , pascal &apos;s deviating from the plan .
watch to see where they exit the building .
i &apos;m ready .
ems , they &apos;re headed up , not down .
stay here . let me know what floor they get off on .
they must be headed for the penthouse .
no , no , no . no , wait . ems , they &apos;re going to the roof .
and you may have some unwanted company soon .
i have to fly back to the hamptons .
care to join ?
let &apos;s talk here .
what &apos;s -- what &apos;s so pressing ?
i &apos;m haunted by things we did in our past .
and what were those , pray tell ?
trevor mathis . david clarke .
no , those are your ghosts , pascal , not mine .
i want to move on . don &apos;t you understand ?
i want what i &apos;ve always wanted --
to win at any cost .
or do you need me to be more specific ?
yes , i do .
well , let &apos;s try this .
sometimes , to thrive ,
you need to do the unexpected .
pascal , watch out !
no ! my god !
better call 911 .
why aren &apos;t you arresting him ?
for what , my dear ?
as i was telling the detective , pascal wanted to talk ,
and i offered him a ride to the hamptons .
he stepped back , and ...
i mean , i tried to warn him , but it was too late .
you can &apos;t believe a word he says .
the pilot corroborates his story .
it &apos;s a damn tragedy .
no , no !
right . okay .
well , thank you . bye .
that was the local police calling back about the cabin .
there &apos;s nothing illegal about writing to you ,
but they should be able to make sure
that it doesn &apos;t turn into something else .
that &apos;s probably why my mom was saving the letters --
to have evidence if it did .
you okay ?
yeah .
it would have been nice to meet my dad .
i &apos;ve heard so many things about him from so many people .
i wonder what he was actually like , if i &apos;m anything like him .
well , he was a good guy .
so , yeah , charlie , you are .
need a ride home ?
i think i &apos;m gonna take a walk , be alone for awhile .
thanks , jack , for putting my mind at ease .
i don &apos;t understand .
i mean , i &apos;m supposed to believe my father tripped and fell ?
what was he doing with conrad , anyway ?
margaux , we &apos;ll get answers .
i promise . but right now , you just ...
i mean , years of wanting a relationship with him ,
and it was there .
we were having it .
no one could have seen this coming .
can people stop with their condolences ? !
just give me a moment !
they &apos;re not condolences .
you &apos;re the new c.e.o.
don &apos;t -- d @-@ don &apos;t worry . don &apos;t even think about it .
i &apos;ll handle everything for now , okay ?
he &apos;s gone .
oh , he &apos;s really gone .
he just pushed him , aiden .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
conrad certainly chose a brazen moment to get his hands dirty .
do you think he was onto us ?
he was onto something .
he &apos;s clearly willing to go to great lengths to protect himself .
we need to take him down .
do you have a plan ?
i think so .
to succeed , a revolution requires absolute dedication
against overwhelming odds .
we &apos;ll see if i can go through with it .
at a moment &apos;s notice , the tide can turn .
and every casualty stokes the fire
to win at any cost .
&quot; victoria , our future is limitless .
&quot; to eternity together .
i love you . &quot;
mom ?
anything i can do for you ?
yes .
you can tell me how your father
came to learn of pascal &apos;s intentions .
did you tell him ?
of course i didn &apos;t tell him .
he &apos;s probably got a contact at homeland security
who tipped him off !
he &apos;s taken my future away from me again ,
and i &apos;m going to see him burn in hell for it .
we don &apos;t actually know what happened up there .
and from where i stand ,
neither guy was looking to do right by you .
don &apos;t you dare .
pascal loved me .
there &apos;s something else .
come on . let &apos;s get you cleaned up . this is , like ...
daniel , please .
i just want to be alone .
there &apos;s one thing i can &apos;t wrap my head around .
if the feds were running pascal ,
where are they now ?
the number you have dialed is no longer in service .
if you think you &apos;ve reached this number in error ,
please hang up and try again .
the number you have dialed is no longer in service .
because the only guarantee in a revolution
is that the innoce are the first to fall .
