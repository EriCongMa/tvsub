"throwing it all away"
You know your tailbone?
It used to be a tail.
Sofia!
That pink part in the corner of your eye?
It used to be a third eyelid.
Ugh, skull is cracked.
They said he went through the windshield?
V-tach. No pulse!
Paddles!
Charge to 100!
Donald Mercer.
The appendix used to help us
digest tough foods.
Now it does nothing.
Clear!
The story of our evolution
is the story of what we leave behind,
what we've discarded.
Uh, explain, please.
Oh, Sofia got fruit juice all over it.
And, you know, she could fry the microprocessor in here.
Now I'm gonna be late.
And I've told her not to play with my leg!
Uh, no, you haven't actually -- ever.
Hey, um, I found these.
Um, where should I put them?
What?
Your wheelie sneaks.
Oh. Trash.
Really?
Yeah.
Callie, it's fine.
Our bodies only hang on to the things we absolutely need.
Clear!
Okay, I've got a rhythm. I got a pulse.
Wait.
The things we no longer have use for...
No pupillary response, no pain response,
Visible brain matter, no evidence of brain activity.
I think we lost him.
...we give up...
Maybe there's a mistake, please.
I need to see him.
...we let go.
Jared Cole, suffered byler's disease since birth,
complains of increasing jaundice,
edema, frequent fevers...
So his condition has gotten much worse.
And if the bile continues to build up,
then we're looking at cirrhosis or possible liver failure.
He has to go on the list now, for a transplant?
We have one more chance to avoid it,
Uh, a diversion procedure.
We'll take a piece of his intestine
and create a detour for the bile
to drain out through his abdomen.
I'll have a hole in my stomach?
I know, that sounds weird.
But it's our best shot
so that you don't feel like you're getting sick all the time
and so you don't look like an oompa loompa.
Does that sound good?
Sweetie, the doctor asked you a question.
Are you a robot?
Jared Cole, manners!
I am so sorry.
No, no. That's a valid question.
No, I'm not a robot.
I'm almost that cool.
I got into an accident, and I lost my leg.
And then they gave me a new one.
Can you jump super high?
No.
See you in there.
After all he's been through,
we gotta cut up his perfectly healthy intestine
and put a hole in his belly?
Hey, you saw his bilirubin. He's out of options.
Wilson, go check on his coags before we go to surgery.
You're gonna need to assign someone else.
Wilson's no longer in peds.
What? - Why? - You -- you're suspended from surgery.
What?
You broke the non-fraternization rule.
And it was just gonna be a slap on the wrist, Karev,
until you decided to give the board the finger.
Three days, no surgery. Wilson, the E.R.
I have my byler's kid.
You're gonna let this rule mess with patient care?
Robbins can take that case.
Thanks. Makes my day real easy.
Well, I'm afraid it's about to get harder.
H.R. wants to talk to you today.
H.R.?
The anonymous harassment complaint
came from Leah Murphy.
Oh, god.
Yeah, and, legally, H.R. has to investigate,
and they want you to answer some questions.
And that might be the end of it.
And if it's not?
I have no time for this today.
No contact with Murphy, okay?
Hey, Derek! Are you coming by the lab today?
We're starting to lose all our phase two momentum.
Yeah. Actually, they're setting up my new office today.
Oh, you know what? I got to grab a sensor.
The guys are going to duplicate one.
Ah, yes. The Washington guys, mappin' the brain.
You're actually gonna have time to do this, too, though, right?
Yeah. I hope so. I plan to.
All right. Well, let me know when you're ready.
"Oh, yeah. Call me. We'll hang out."
I haven't seen a blowoff like that since high school.
It was not a blowoff.
I have nothing against Ross.
I just don't think he should be on my service.
Look, he needs to feel that he has your support.
He's trying to find his footing.
I know, and I think he lost it
because I was not the best influence.
Also, we had...
inappropriate --
Shenanigans. I know.
That's what the rule is for, Dr. Yang,
so we can work together without the shenanigans.
I think it's a bad idea, sir,
And I think the chief will, too.
Well, the chief asked me to keep an eye on Ross.
So it's my call, not his.
And as far as you're concerned, Dr. Yang,
I am still and will always be the chief.
Yes, sir.
Sorry,
about what I said.
I was a complete jerk.
I heard you got busted.
Yep.
I have to miss out on my education
so they can keep me on a separate floor from Alex.
See, I want that rule.
If I find myself alone in a room with Jackson,
I'm afraid I'm gonna nut punch him.
So every time he has a consult in the E.R. today,
I'm taking a break.
You shouldn't.
You should nut punch him.
We'd all want to see that.
He married her, Jo.
One day, he's with me, the next day,
he's not just with her, she's his wife.
So, what the hell was I all that time,
that he could just... toss me aside like garbage?
Oh, my God.
It was right outside --
By the dumpsters.
He's warm, pulse is weak. He's breathing fast.
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Hey, little one. How are you?
What are you, like 8 months, 9 months?
Oh, what do we have here?
You've had some surgeries before.
Okay. Let's get him up into the PICU.
Uh, I'll -- I'll get a peds gurney.
So, page cardio and call the police.
Get prints, any identifying marks,
find out if he was born here, seen here.
We're gonna find out who this little guy is.
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Are you okay?
Oh, I think you broke my leg.
Oh, my -- oh, my God! - It's all right.
I have another one in my car.
What happened?!
Oh, I'm fine.
I was walking, and -- - What happened?
I'm fine! I was --
I had an accident, my leg got broken,
and someone's bringing me a spare.
I'm fine.
Oh, God! I'm sorry!
I got it. I got the leg.
Oh, Dr. Robbins, I am so sorry.
Edwards, you know what?
You should go page cardio
and then go do a work-up on the baby.
I'll go with her.
Whoa, Wilson, what baby?
We found a baby in the trash.
No, you're not doing the work-up.
But it's my dumpster baby!
You're not on peds. I have a patient for you.
Oh, Bailey, um, I have a Byler's biliary diversion surgery today,
and I lost Karev, so can you assist?
You got it!
Okay, everybody out. Please.
Are you okay?
Yeah, my neck's a little sore, and my leg is totaled.
Oh, geez.
Now I have to wear my old beater leg.
I thought you said this chafes you?
Well, it's better than nothing
until my other one's fixed.
All right. Here.
Oh, um, can you make it to round on Alyssa Cramer?
The club-feet girl? She's back?
Yeah, scar revision.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Hey, um, listen. H.R. wants to talk to me.
The anonymous harassment claim came from Leah Murphy.
All right. You good here?
Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm.
I understand that I broke a rule,
but I don't think it's fair for this to affect my education.
You spend more time on peds than any other service.
Because I'm interested in peds!
Yeah, well, I'm interested in giving you a well-rounded education.
So today, you're on trauma, and this is your patient.
Mr. Donald Mercer is an organ donor.
He was injured in an MVC this morning.
We're waiting the 6 hours
to confirm the diagnosis of brain death.
Okay.
Now, you will make sure that his organs
are in optimum condition for donation,
and then you will get to scrub in on the organ recovery.
You got it?
But that's like six surgeries in one!
Trauma's not so bad now, huh?
She's filled out all the donor paperwork.
She just wants a couple minutes with him
before she starts making arrangements.
Of course.
Excuse me, uh, doctor?
This isn't the right time for this, I'm -- I'm sure.
I mean, there probably isn't one.
But I-I feel like it can't wait.
How can we help?
Donnie had a kidney transplant about four months ago.
Yeah, we knew about that.
That was me.
I donated my kidney for him.
Wow. That's...
He was lucky to have friends like you.
He was. Yeah. Uh, amazing.
So, um...
I was wondering, about the kidney...
can I get that back?
Yeah, I can see you.
I don't know why you can't see me.
But we're still setting up here, so...
Yes, uh, so, then you did get all the proposals?
Uh, yeah. Yep. Yep. They're right here.
Great, great.
And, um, you're sending us a prototype
of your asymmetrical sensor?
Yeah, sending it out today.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
And, obviously, discontinue any other work
you'll be doing with the sensors,
and I will e-mail you a release for the patent.
Wait, I'm sorry, "discontinue"?
My work with Dr. Torres is ongoing.
Uh, well, not with your sensors.
They have to be proprietary to the work that we're doing
our N.I.H. grant is dependent on that.
You understand?
I'm not sure Dr. Torres will.
And I have to say, Lloyd, I don't like it.
Uh, well, I'm, uh...
I'm sorry, Derek,
but it's pretty clear from our agreement --
we and the N.I.H. hired you,
and your sensors come with you.
Oh, hey, little guy.
What do we know?
He's had a median sternotomy, a couple of chest tubes.
Low sats, high B.P.,
Failure to thrive.
Have you cuddled him?
No, I have not.
Well, if I were left in a cardboard box,
all I'd want is cuddling, right?
Oh, I think I'd want a cardiac cath
to confirm I've had a coarctation of my aorta.
He is like a puzzle that I can't solve...
Oh, whoopsie!
if you're gonna do that.
Do you have a coarctation of your aorta? Do you?
No record of the baby being a former patient.
The police are getting statements
from Edwards and Wilson.
Oh, that's right.
Um, I have a patient,
so will you call me when you're done with his cath?
Ross, you want to take the baby?
I'd rather not.
Ross, take the baby.
Come here.
Are you squeaking?
Long story.
Can I put him down now?
No. She's right. He should be cuddled.
You're not gonna hurt him.
And I don't want to do it.
Did I hear you found a baby?
Yes. In a box, abandoned.
Oh, is it all right?
I don't know.
I imagine it's pretty traumatized,
having been suddenly left behind,
thrown aside. - Stephanie --
Dumped, as it were, in the trash.
Would you please let me talk?
You -- you really want to get out of my way.
Three days I'm suspended from surgery.
You bang a co-worker,
and you get a house and two kids.
I do it, and I get suspended.
I know. I'm a hypocrite, I've heard.
I'm supposed to do a biliary diversion.
I like this kid.
I've been treating him for years.
I want to make sure it's done right.
But do me a favor. Talk to Hunt.
See if he'll start my stupid sentence tomorrow.
I will. I'm gonna talk to him.
Thank you. You're a hypocrite and you suck!
Hey, did you hear, uh, grumpy and hairball
found a baby in the trash?
Emma Marling came by to get a key for the trailer.
Why are you telling me this?
It's gossip. I'm gossiping.
Oh, okay. Shoot.
To get her things because her and Owen are through.
Through? Why?
I don't know. She didn't say.
But I don't think it was her idea.
I can't tell if you're happy or sad.
Neither can I.
It hurts like a bitch, dad!
Don't talk like that!
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby!
We've gone over this and --
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Alyssa. Herb.
Guys, what's going on?
We're just gonna do another stupid surgery,
and I'll still in pain.
Simmer down.
No, no. I know.
Your arthrogryposis symptoms are worsening,
but today's surgery will alleviate the scarring
and hopefully the pain, too.
You said that before my last surgery.
I know.
And the one before that and the one before that!
Stop it. - You keep lying to me about --
They are trying -- they are trying to help you!
I have had braces and castings and surgeries,
and none of it works!
So, I want to know...
don't.
...if you can just cut them off.
Just give me the fake legs.
Then I can still do all the stuff I want to do.
Yeah, she's been talking like this for a month now.
Please tell her that I am not gonna allow anybody --
What? Disable me? Dad, I am disabled now!
I still can't walk!
It hurts when I stand for more than three minutes.
I'll never run!
It hurts when I try to sleep!
Tell her she's being ridiculous.
You are!
She won't talk to me.
I live in a bed, dad, and
there are girls running marathons with fake legs!
Alyssa.
It has -- it has been a long road.
Look at how long.
And I know -- I know it hurts...
And it feels like you can't go any further,
but this is the time you have to be brave
and push through it and have faith.
Even if it's not working yet,
it's going to work.
Right?
I'm not so sure about that.
I cannot believe that you didn't back me up in there.
I mean, a kid wants to cut off her legs!
I'm just suggesting that you don't dismiss it out of hand.
Hey, Callie, you got a minute?
Something kind of unexpected came up.
Hold on a sec. Really?
Because it sounds to me like you're asking me
to just throw away three years' worth of hard work
and investment in this girl,
just cut it off and throw it away like it never happened.
And I don't want to do that.
I'm sorry, Derek. What is it?
Nothing. I'm good.
Somebody tried to fix his coarctation.
Did a hack job.
Look, it's closing up already.
Um, I'm going to reopen.
Um, prep a balloon catheter.
Did you notice anything about his mitral valve?
I don't know.
Shane, come on.
This is like a puzzle.
I found the corner pieces. I need help with the sky.
The valve leaflets were thickened and shortened.
A parachute mitral valve?
Yes. And there's a supravalvular mitral ring.
The three indicate...
coarctation,
Supravalvular mitral ring, and parachute...
Shone's complex?
Bingo.
A trifecta of congenital heart defects.
That answers another question.
What?
Why they abandoned him.
The kid had one heart surgery.
He needed at least two more.
Someone thought he was more trouble than he's worth.
What are you doing here? Go away.
What are you doing?
Organ donor.
I have to keep him alive until he's actually dead.
Nice.
I'm off peds, and Hunt's got you arranging a meat platter.
I know. But I'm gonna show him.
I'm gonna keep his organs so healthy,
someone could use his appendix.
You should go. If Hunt shows up, he's gonna --
We could use his appendix.
It was a joke.
We don't donate --
No, that could work.
Karev, don't make me turn three days into a week.
Did I get too close to Wilson?
Did an alarm go off somewhere?
But it's a donor organ,
so it can't be...regifted.
I don't understand, though. It's mine.
Yes. Yes. It was yours,
but then you gave it to him.
And now he's not using it,
a-and I'm still down one kidney.
I-I loaned him my bike.
I'm probably gonna get that back.
I should wait a month or so.
Sir, um, transplanting the kidney
put a pretty big strain on the organ.
To do it again would be risky for you and your kidney.
See? - His -- his kidney.
You said "My kidney."
You think I should get it back.
Um...I actually -- I have to be elsewhere right now.
Oh. Oh, no. Of course.
Yeah, no. I-I'll wait here.
Ouch.
We don't have to cut Jared's intestine.
What?
Jared Cole.
Instead of the intestine,
we use, uh, the appendix to make the stoma.
It's easier on him, and it's, uh,
repurposing something he doesn't need anyway.
That's the same procedure,
resulting in a cutaneous end-stoma?
Even easier. And the appendix is -- is narrower,
So a smaller hole in his stomach,
more normal life.
Reduces complications, recovery time, and
oh, crap.
Uh, sorry. I-I didn't know you were, um...
Uh, I can wait till you're finished.
No, Alex, it's fine.
'cause I never see you like that. You okay?
Yeah. It's a blister.
I think using the appendix is a great idea.
Let's look into it.
Well, I can get him prepped.
Whoa, oh. This does not mean that you're scrubbing in.
I'm sorry.
He just came off his hinges when he saw you.
Yeah, there are two different looks that you get.
Without the leg on, they feel sorry for you.
And with the leg on,
they think that you're amazing and brave.
Yeah, or a robot.
Any word from the police
about my mystery baby in a box?
No. Social services is on it now.
What's his status?
Uh, he needs a mitral valve repair,
which I'm gonna do tomorrow.
He's already been through enough for one day.
So, what's this I hear about you being an idiot?
You broke up with her?
She was it, Owen.
The picket fence, a dozen kids,
fresh baked goods.
I don't want to talk about that, okay?
Because you're dumb?
No, because it's between her and me.
And I hurt her, and I feel bad,
so I don't want to talk about it.
Why throw that away?
Is it because of what happened at the trailer?
That was -- - Give me some credit.
I know what that was.
Then why?
Okay, all right.
Why are you so upset about it?
Uh, because.
Because...why?
Because of what happened in the trailer?
I don't care for the direction this is taking.
I'll tell you if you tell me.
No.
Dr. Robbins.
Hey, Herb.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you have kids?
Yes, I do.
I have a little girl.
You have a little girl,
and you can still tell me
that I should cut my daughter's legs off?
No.
Ultimately, that's her decision.
But she can't make it without your help.
You think her life's gonna be better with no legs?
You think kids aren't gonna stare at her,
that they're not gonna make fun of her if she's crippled?
Disabled --
Crippled, disabled --
What -- what difference does it make?!
I don't care what you call it.
How can you say that?
I never thought that I'd carry my daughter
or be a doctor again.
And now there's very few things I can't do because of this.
When did that happen?
I've had it since before we met.
I didn't notice.
Why would you?
Herb...
Alyssa's arthrogryposis is so severe,
And her muscles put too much strain on her joints.
And it won't get worse,
but the pain will never stop.
It's just me and her now,
and I don't want to make the wrong decision.
I know. I know.
She's your little girl.
46-year-old male,
complains of tightness in chest,
possibly heart-related,
probably enchilada-related.
Pulse in the 70s,
B.P. 170/110.
Trauma two.
You do any more bowling for doctors today?
What? You heard?
Oh, it's all over the radio.
Oh, my god.
Oh, I'm just saying, the next time you do it,
try and take out Kepner.
Oh, god!
That'll work, too.
Guys, I'm fine, okay?
I'm so sorry.
No, no. You warned me to stay out of your way.
Was Robbins your warm-up?
I didn't do this on purpose.
Edwards, I'm about to take his pants off.
Go be someplace where you won't be a danger to others.
What happened?!
Oh, god.
Um... I'm fine, okay?
I got hit by a gurney.
There she is!
All right, Dr. Edwards!
Two for two!
Hey, chief. Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah. What is it, Grey?
So, it's about Alex Karev.
Uh, sorry.
Um, Robbins? Have you been up to H.R. today?
Oh, no. I haven't had a chance.
We've been developing a biliary diversion using the appendix.
Right. I was gonna have all the interns observe.
That is a pretty inventive approach.
But, Robbins, H.R. needs that statement today.
Yeah, okay. Um, Bailey, why don't you go on up without me?
And by the time that you have jared on the table,
I'll be done with this thing.
And you should get someone to assist you, too.
Oh, uh, I'll take Grey.
Wait, no!
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about, because it's Karev's case.
It was his idea, so he should be on it.
Karev's suspended. You're on it.
Terrific.
Hey.
I have to tell Karev that I stole his surgery.
Oh, I have to tell Torres
that the president won't let her use my sensors any more.
Just tell her you made a promise to her,
but instead, you're gonna spend
your time and energy on something else.
It worked when you told me.
I thought we were gonna help each other.
You left yourself wide open there.
Callie's a grown-up.
She knows how research works. Just tell her.
And Karev will be... understanding about it.
Oh, no. I'm not telling him.
Did you get to talk to her?
No. I was on the floor.
She didn't do it on purpose, did she?
No. No. I don't...think so.
Maybe.
Well, what about you? Did you talk to Matthew?
I left another message.
Nicole said he quit,
and then she called me a name.
So that's all I know.
Can you just talk to her,
apologize for both of us?
I'm trying.
Nurses' station.
Oh, God. You scared me!
Any word on my kidney? You were gonna give it some thought.
I, uh...no.
No, I wasn't.
Oh, Dr. Hunt!
Um, do we return donor organs to donors
when the recipient passes on?
Absolutely not.
UNOS is very strict about this.
Um, why do you...want it?
Well, it's the principle, isn't it?
You know, t-these are not the terms of the agreement.
I donated my organ for a purpose,
to-- to filter my buddy's...pee or whatever it does.
And-- and now it's just being discarded.
So I-I think I have a right to get my kidney back.
I'm not quite following. Is, um, your other kidney failing?
It-- it could.
You never know what's gonna happen, right?
Y-you're just fine, sir.
Am I?
Oh, wow! Uh, that's my pager vibrating.
Uh-huh. Oh! Oh! Is yours vibrating, too?
Oh, yeah, it is. It's urgent.
Okay.
Um, we're very sorry about your friend.
I'm sorry.
Is he stalking you?
Hey.
Herb Cramer just told me that you were pushing him
toward an amputation for Alyssa.
No. I wasn't pushing anything, Callie,
But, I mean, it's the right thing to do.
And you've done palliative amputations before--
Yeah, on a soldier!
A a grown man.
Not a child whose legs
I have been trying to correct for three years!
And failing. I'm sorry. It's true.
And honestly, I mean, before last year,
I think that you would have seen it.
Okay. So you think this is about you?
It's about Alyssa. It's not about me.
But it's not about you, either.
Why would you say that it's not about me?
I didn't say that it, because I am--
I-I think that you're afraid to do this amputation,
and I'm afraid that that might be my fault.
Dr. Robbins?
Hi. I'm Anne from H.R.
We're ready for you upstairs.
Okay, thanks.
I...
Yeah.
There's just a few questions we need to go over.
It shouldn't take long.
I'm sure you're busy.
Clear!
Shane, no!
Don't shock him! His heart can't take defibrillation!
I thought so, too.
So I tried to stabilize him with cardioversion--
One shock, timed in the refractory period of his heartbeat,
to get a good sinus rhythm.
And I think it worked.
Good call, Ross!
He could have a mitral valve rupture.
Uh, clear an O.R., page Robbins,
And set up for a redo sternotomy.
Okay.
They what?!
They want my sensors proprietary to them,
which means...
...they can no longer be used for our research.
Well, we can't do our research without them.
I know.
Well, what are you gonna do?
This isn't gonna keep you from doing their project, is it?
Callie, I never expected them to do this.
Okay. I'm going to try to fight them on this, but in the meantime...
You understand?
Uh, I think so.
You partnered up with me,
but now you're taking our ball
and you're gonna go play with your new friends.
I understand that the last six months
was a complete waste of my time.
She understands.
And at that point, Dr. Torres handed her the drill, correct?
And that's when Dr. Murphy
drilled through Dr. Torres' patient's leg
and into the table?
That's correct, yes.
At the time of that incident,
you said you had terminated
any romantic relationship with Dr. Murphy?
I had, yes.
There was no contact of a romantic or sexual nature after the incident?
No. There was not.
Okay.
Oh, I have an emergency.
I'm sorry. I have to --
No problem. That's really all I need.
Well, you -- that's it? You don't need me to come back?
Mm, no. Or do you have more...?
No. No. It's just, I mean, if I'm being accused of something,
I think that I should have a little more time
to, you know, to speak my -- - Oh, no. Don't worry.
Dr. Murphy didn't lodge the complaint against you.
Thank you.
Hey. What happened?
Oscar had flash pulmonary edema.
His mitral valve blew. I'm gonna go fix it.
Ugh, I was stuck in H.R.
Is Murphy coming after you?
Worse, actually. Her complaint is against Callie.
Callie? Why?
I don't know.
No, I mean, I know, but I-I didn't want to believe it.
Right -- "Oscar."
'cause you found him in a trash can.
Hey, do you need to be in your byler's surgery?
'cause I'm good here.
You sure?
Yeah. I've got Ross.
Okay, that's Callie now. Um, come find me after?
Yeah. Okay.
Tell Dr. Bailey to go ahead and start without me.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
They asked for you.
I just need to hear it again.
Tell me that you think this is the right idea.
I do.
Dr. Torres has done everything
that anyone could do to stop your pain,
But -- it's not working.
And by every indication,
more surgery will just mean more time in a hospital bed,
more scarring, and the same results --
Pain for the rest of her life.
She'll never run?
I'll never... walk her down the aisle?
Not unless we amputate.
Instead of the surgery that you have scheduled for today,
please schedule a double amputation.
I want her pain to stop today.
Okay.
Thank you, daddy.
Callie.
No, it's fine.
It's just one more thing today.
H.R. wants to see you.
Leah Murphy's complaint is against you.
They wanted Hunt to tell you, but I asked if I could.
I thought that I, you know...
Okay, well, um...
I, uh, have to push this amputation --
No, I'll take that off your plate.
I mean, I'll do it.
And you come find me when you're done?
I'm -- I'm so -- I'm sorry.
You know, I just got through a malpractice suit.
Now I have to deal with your jealous ex-girlfriend
trying to ruin my reputation?!
I swear to God, I can't take any more of this!
The heart has so many abnormalities.
It's incredibly fragile.
Uh, 4-0 prolene.
You have to really be delicate.
I want to ask you about something,
But there are all these new rules,
And, uh, the act of me asking might be breaking them.
You can ask.
There was a complaint.
That's a question?
I thought it might be you.
It wasn't.
I know, but it made me wonder
if you ever felt compromised.
because I didn't want you to.
I didn't.
Good.
Oh, now that sounds like coercion.
Like I'm telling you how you were supposed to feel.
I didn't take it that way.
Really?
You're not just saying that to curry favor?
No. I'm not "Currying" anything.
Because you never have to do that.
You don't have to get Shepherd coffee
or fix Callie's baby schedule
or...relax me.
You're too good of a doctor for that.
And when you look back in 10 years,
You'll be relieved you didn't.
I don't know if I'll even be a doctor in 10 years.
Oh, shut up. You will. You better.
Now, that's coercion.
That should be you down there.
Who cares? I'm doing an organ recovery.
Screw peds.
I'll basically be on general, cardiothoracic,
ortho, plastics, and pulmonary in one operation.
Wow. I've got to go up to H.R. To fill out an accident report.
Oh, for hitting Robbins with a gurney?
For hitting Jackson with a gurney.
Yeah.
Robbins should be here to see this.
Looks good.
Appendix is holding.
Uh, Grey, will you intubate the stoma,
Make sure it's patent?
Oh, crap.
What? What happened?
What? What's going on?
He's gone into v-fib.
I pushed epi and atropine.
Did you shock him? You gotta shock him!
Dr. Wilson, he's already gone!
No! There are at least nine people counting on him not to be gone!
Move! Clear!
What are you doing here?
You asked for a resident.
I'm the only one available.
I'll do it myself.
Are you actually gonna do that?
You're gonna refuse to work with --
Leah, I cared for you.
I liked you, and that's all that it was.
And I am sorry that I hurt you.
But if you're gonna come after my wife now because of the --
I know what our relationship was.
I'm not a child.
I never thought of it in terms of work.
It was you who brought it into the hospital.
You told Dr.Torres about us,
And Dr.Torres chose not to teach me in a moment
that put a patient in danger.
She made me put a patient in danger. So did you.
I-I never thought that --
You were thinking about yourself.
It wasn't safe, it wasn't fair, and I had to say something.
Because it shouldn't happen again, to me or anyone.
You want to cut the fibula
1 to 2 centimeters proximal to the tibia.
Then you're gonna reshape the end with a bevel
so that the prosthesis will fit better.
You watching?
Good.
'cause you're gonna do the other leg yourself.
Hey. Hi, Kim.
How are you feeling?
I feel pretty good.
And you don't look like a basketball.
You did a good job.
Yeah, well, I had to watch them,
make sure they didn't screw it up.
Get some rest?
All right.
That was having my back?
I knew you were a hypocrite, but that was really cold.
Stop it. You're suspended. Somebody had to be in there.
Read this.
What is it?
It's me having your back.
I got it from H.R. It's a love contract.
A what?
It's a declaration of a relationship.
If you sign this and Wilson signs it,
it clears everybody from any claims
of favoritism or sexual harassment.
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard of.
Well, it sounds stupid,
but H.R. Said if you sign this
that it makes the whole thing go away.
So, sign it.
No!
Well, then I'm done trying to help you.
I can't go to her with this.
Look, I asked her to marry me
when I was freaking out about my dad.
I scared the crap out of her.
If you guys keep screwing with us --
How are we screwing with you?
Jo wants to be a surgeon, Mer.
She came from nothing to be here.
Now, cause of me,
there are suspensions and punishments.
If you keep making it harder, she's gonna leave me.
And if you make it too hard,
she's gonna be like Izzie and she'll walk.
Will you just sign the stupid paper?
Watch his SATs through the night.
Below 85, page me.
Uh, is that Oscar's file?
The baby? Yes.
And that stays with him, right?
And his name -- Dr.Shane ross.
The adoptive parents will have questions.
In 10 years, Oscar will have questions.
And you will answer them.
You know, I could sue you guys.
I could sue this entire hospital.
Sir, you signed away your legal rights to the kidney
when you agreed to be a donor!
No, he broke our deal.
The -- the terms were I give him my kidney to use,
and he has broken our deal!
It was a gift!
He threw it away!
Thom!
Step back right now, or I will call security.
Dr.Kepner...
Wilson...
Donald Mercer suffered cardiac death.
Organ recovery's called off.
It's all going in the trash.
Dr.Wilson,
Thom here is Mr.Mercer's friend.
Oh, I am -- I'm sorry.
No. No, he what? Do-- Donald what?
He died, Thom.
No, I-I don't understand. You said he was just brain dead.
He was.
He was, and his heart was sustaining his organs.
But now his organs are no longer viable
for donation because he's gone.
Donald is gone.
This is -- this is not right.
This is -- this is not fair.
I know. I know it's not fair.
It's not fair at all.
No, no.
He's -- He's my best friend, since 7th grade.
I-I saved his life.
I-I gave him my kidney.
I was...
I was supposed to have saved his
I just...
Okay.
All right, come on.
I know.
Let's just sit down.
Hey. Oscar's doing well.
He needs, uh, more observation, but -- ooh.
Bad leg day.
Yeah, me too.
What would have happened if they hadn't found him out there?
He'd be dead.
Yeah, but he's not.
He'll grow up.
He'll be, you know, who knows who.
He'll have a whole life.
Do you still have dreams about it?
Usually when I'm anxious.
The day, um,
before Sofia started her first day of preschool,
I dreamt about it all night,
about Mark and Lexie and the pilot
Jerry.
Jerry.
Jerry.
For me, I dream about you screaming.
You wouldn't stop screaming.
So thank you for that.
Good job today.
Lucky kid.
Lucky kid.
Just the accident report and the worker's comp paperwork.
Shouldn't take long.
You can sit in here.
Dr. Edwards is filling out an accident report, as well.
You two mind sharing?
Brilliant.
You know what? I can -- I can come back.
No. It's fine. I'm almost done.
Okay, then.
How's your leg?
My knee is...
I'm fine.
How about you? How are you?
I didn't see you coming.
That's not what I meant.
No, I know that.
I'm sorry, Stephanie.
Will you let me say that to you, please? Okay?
I am so sorry.
I had no idea I was gonna do that.
None.
I thought I was --
I told myself that I didn't want her,
that April didn't want me.
And you and I... w--
Steph, you are so -- - Please don't.
Don't do that.
I'm trying to say I didn't see it coming.
Okay? There's no way I wanted to hurt you.
And I don't know how I can make that better.
You can't.
And, anyway, we both got a day we'll never forget.
Steph -- - You got a day to tell your grandkids about,
and I got something I'd never gotten before.
I got pitied.
I-I was suddenly the girl who wasn't good enough
or smart enough or pretty enough or not deserving.
I've never gotten that look before
because I'm not that girl.
I know that.
Look, you can hit me with as many gurneys as you want to,
because I'm gonna feel terrible about this
for the rest of my life.
Okay. Well, you do that if you want to. I'm not.
I'm not going to feel sad
or angry or pitiable for one more minute,
because I'm not gonna care about you.
So, if I don't say hello
or make small talk on the elevator
or acknowledge your birthday
or even acknowledge you're alive,
it's because, to me, you just exist.
Because I don't care.
Why does it feel so good to get rid of things...
...To unload...
To let go?
How did it go?
I'm going to bed.
I think Murphy was right.
Oh, of course she was right, Arizona!
I mistreated her!
And I was petty and jealous
and at my worst because you slept with her!
Of course she was right!
I keep thinking we're okay.
And we -- we buy a house,
and then this happens,
and I'm not sure we'll ever be okay.
And today I lost my research,
I failed a patient,
and now I have a disciplinary report
that's gonna follow me forever.
So I'm going to bed!
I'm sorry.
I feel like all I've been doing is thinking about myself.
God, I swear! I swear
I cannot listen to you apologize one more time.
You have made it very hard to keep forgiving you!
For over a year, since the plane crash,
all I have been thinking about is myself.
I had to figure out how to...be me.
I used to be someone who was always happy.
I woke up happy.
I was someone who used to skate at work.
And then this happened,
and everything was hard
and everything took thought and -- and planning.
And my life felt like it didn't fit me anymore.
And I just -- I wanted --
I wanted to tear it all down and start over,
just throw it away and find a life that fit who I am now.
But I'm starting to feel like I know who I am again.
And I've had to give up things,
but what I've learned is that I don't need much.
I don't need to be happy.
I don't even need two legs.
But I do know... that I need you.
I need Sofia,
and I need you.
And I'm -- I'm afraid,
now that I've learned all of that,
that I made you give up on me.
Maybe because when we see
how little we actually need to survive...
You shouldn't have to give up anything.
...it makes us realize how powerful we actually are.
To strip down to only what we need.
You want to know why I'm upset?
I'll tell you why.
Okay, why?
She's what you wanted.
You don't just throw away a future like that.
I want you to be happy.
Oh, do you?
Of course!
Or do you just want to see me squared away?
What does that mean?!
It means, uh, you want to see me,
you know, get what I want
so you don't have to feel guilty anymore.
About what?
About not giving it to me.
Right?
It's either that,
or you just want to see me get married off
so you're forced to stop thinking about me.
Oh, that's it. That's the one.
To hang on only to what we can't do without.
What we need...
not just to survive...
Yes!
...but to thrive.
Calliope!
*If you fall, I will catch you*
*I will be waiting*
Here we go!
