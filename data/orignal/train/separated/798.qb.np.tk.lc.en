graffiti &apos;s wrong , kids .

i love corn on the cob , too ,
but i &apos;m not gonna paint it all over the walls .
i &apos;m just hoping , you know , in a few years
i &apos;ll have enough experience
that dr. foster will consider me for vice principal .
why don &apos;t you just ask him for it ?
you can &apos;t just ask for a promotion . you know .
you have to earn the promotion with years of good work .
what &apos;s funny ?
uh , how &apos;s that working out for you , jess ?
do you see this volleyball ?
it won &apos;t get over the net just because you want it to .
and you hope someone will notice that you want it to .
i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time :
what ... do you ... want ?
um , i want to be vice principal .
all right . then spike that ball , jess .
oh , that &apos;s not ... okay ...
you got to spike ! you got to spike !
is that really ... yeah . okay .

i want to be the vice principal !
i will not laugh .
an outrage !

i can &apos;t get enough of this legal drama .
check this out . favorite author , grisham .

but i &apos;m not gonna forget how to be a lawyer .
i guess i have no choice . you can be my lawyer , nick .
i won &apos;t do it .
i value myself too great for that .
if you want me to be your lawyer ,
if you want to win this case , you must start
with the word &quot; please . &quot;
and i &apos;ll need a symbolic five @-@ dollar retainer .
four dollars .
skin it . let &apos;s do it .
dr. foster , i am young , i &apos;m energetic
and i think it &apos;s about time you take advantage of me !
well , this is ... a little awkward .
i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m exclusively into asian women .
it &apos;s really a kristi yamaguchi thing .
after lillehammer ...
i really meant professionally--
i want you to take advantage of me like that .
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s a professional thing .
okay . sorry .
i want to be vice principal .
frank retired , you need someone . i deserve it .
i bust my ass for this school .

i spent all those years at law school with those preppy dicks ...
and i never got to prove them wrong , jess .
okay , go after what you want .
just make sure that what you want ...
doesn &apos;t make you a cog on the wheel of a larger , flawed system .
