第二季 第二十二集
the owner is anton velov .
my belief is he &apos;s the c.i.
we pulled all the receipts .
and found a late dinner for two
paid for by a leo andropov .
i got a phone call from an agent
named elizabeth keen .
she was asking about katarina rostova .
tom connolly &apos;s been leaking information to the cabal
about everything that goes on in this place .
you will ignore reddington &apos;s lead .
tell them intel indicates the russian is at union station .
you &apos;ve been set up . you infected the senator .
you need to get out of there now .
senator hawkins remains in critical condition ...
... after being infected by what authorities describe
as a biological agent .
... a staggering development
as it appears connected to te
deaths of the 14 c.i.a. agents .
i &apos;m being framed .
yes , and by the end of the day ,
they &apos;ll identify you by name .
anyone could have infected hawkins .
he must have shaken dozens of hands at that memorial .
within hours , they will all have tested negative for the virus .
you can &apos;t know that . this is insane .
lizzy , you walked into the director &apos;s office
and played him the fulcrum .
you are the enemy .
they &apos;re crawling over every place
you &apos;ve ever lived and worked ,
every file and hard drive like fire ants on a grasshopper .
they won &apos;t find anything .
that &apos;ll suit their purposes just fine .
anything they do find , they &apos;ll erase
so they can say you destroyed evidence
to hide your involvement in the plot .
and when they eventually restore what few pieces
they do want to be found ,
they will not be kind to you .
you need to get out .
if i run , it &apos;ll only make me look guilty .
i &apos;ll be playing right into their hands .
you &apos;re already in their hands .
the only thing they haven &apos;t done is closed their fist .
go . now . i &apos;ll be there in three minutes .
no . they can &apos;t prove i did anything wrong .
they can call me a criminal ,
but i &apos;m not gonna act like one .
where is elizabeth keen ?
harold , a warrant has been issued for her arrest .
anyone hiding her will be charged
with aiding and abetting a terrorist ,
including you .
you used me .
you wanted me to know karakurt was posing as a reporter .
you wanted me to tell keen where to intercept hawkins .
i don &apos;t know how this helps you , framing an f.b.i. agent .
nobody will believe she &apos;s an assassin .
she was at orea when it blew up .
so were dozens of others .
yes , but i &apos;ll bet that
only her prints are found on the truck bomb .
she &apos;ll also test positive for the virus
that killed senator hawkins .
he &apos;s not dead .
yet .
you won &apos;t get away with it .
keen is a distinguished agent .
yes , and the daughter of a russian kgb asset .
she failed to mention that , did she ?
agent keen &apos;s been hiding secrets from you --
secrets that clearly implicate her
as an enemy of this country .
she was handpicked by a notorious fugitive
to assist in expanding his criminal empire .
the two of them have been using this task force
to do reddington &apos;s bidding .
and before you tell me that &apos;s crazy ,
can you really tell me that isn &apos;t true ?
i will never help you do this .
i don &apos;t need your help , harold .
a simple blood test from agent keen
will be as compelling as a signed confession .
the entire area around st. agnes has been quarantined ,
and individuals who might have been exposed , as well ,
have been detained inside the church .
you have no legal authority to hold us here .
senator , i understand you &apos;re upset ,
but we need everyone &apos;s full cooperation .
people are saying hawkins was infected with some sort of virus .
you think we &apos;re infected ?
probably not , but that &apos;s why we set up a mobile lab .
you don &apos;t have probable cause to hold us .
you really want a u.s. senator
claiming wrongful arrest and imprisonment ?
hey , someone just tried
to assassinate a colleague of yours .
nobody &apos;s going anywhere .
but when we &apos;re done here , if you want to file
a complaint or a lawsuit , be my guest .
until then , get back in the line .
what have you found on the feeds ?
we &apos;ve been looking at surveillance feeds
from the moment he arrived until the moment he collapsed .
we &apos;ve rounded up everyone he came into contact with .
which means the killer &apos;s in this room .
i &apos;ve assigned to reven wright
to oversee the investigation of agent keen .
i &apos;m confident she &apos;ll follow the facts .
those facts are not proven .
if you don &apos;t want to help us , that &apos;s fine ,
but i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t need to remind you
what will happen if you actively stand in our way .
you &apos;ll be charged with perjury in the harbormaster case
and leaking privileged grand jury proceedings .
and then there &apos;s charlene .
you need to leave now .
as for the clinical trial ,
i can &apos;t imagine that will continue .
did you hear what i said ?
you can take your pills and your clinical trial .
i would rather die than be part of this .
escort director cooper to his car .
i &apos;m placing him on administrative leave
until we &apos;re finished here .
and find elizabeth keen .
there must be some mistake .
that &apos;s what i thought . we ran the samples twice .
everyone here tested negative for the virus .
we missed something .
i have hawkins on camera
from the moment he stepped out of the car
to the moment he collapsed .
every single person he came into contact with tested negative .
all except one .
you were right .
it &apos;s all set up .
cooper and connolly -- i heard them arguing .
he &apos;s got it all figured out .
he &apos;s presenting evidence , using my mother ,
making it seem like all i &apos;ve been doing
is helping you commit crimes .
lizzy , are you out ?
i &apos;m leaving now .
dembe &apos;s on his way .
as soon as you &apos;re out , find your way to illinois and ridge .
he &apos;ll be there waiting .
yeah .
hello , agent keen .
we &apos;ve been looking for you .
i want the chain of custody
for that sample fully accounted for ,
and i want someone from my task force
to oversee the process and confirm the results .
suspects don &apos;t get to dictate process , agent keen .
you need to listen to me . i &apos;m being framed .
you left the orea building minutes before it was bombed .
yes , and so did my partner !
at no point was i ever anywhere near that truck !
maybe not that morning ,
but your partial prints were on the device .
that &apos;s not possible .
we &apos;ll get you the report .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s what the report says ,
because , as i told you , i &apos;m being framed .
okay , agent keen , who exactly is setting you up ?
&apos;cause from where i sit ,
they &apos;re doing a damn good job of it .
there &apos;s an organization known as the cabal --
a conspiracy formed by world leaders
from the government to the private sector .
conspiracy ? really ?
tom connolly -- that &apos;s who you should be questioning .
cut the crap . we know who you are .
where were you born ?
i was raised in nebraska .
that &apos;s not what i asked . you were born in moscow .
your mother was a kgb agent
named katarina rostova .
your adopted father had a criminal past
you failed to mention .
what is your birth name ?
what ?
your birth name ?
for most people , that &apos;s a pretty simple question .
i never knew my biological parents ,
and my memories were ... blocked .
you expect us to believe that ?
i don &apos;t care what you believe .
intel indicates the existence
of a russian sleeper agent within the fbi .
then maybe you should go out and look for him .
we know the truth , masha .
that &apos;s your real name , isn &apos;t it ?
masha rostova .
answer the question , agent keen .
tell you what . let &apos;s back up .
you wanted to see me ?
let &apos;s go back to orea - the bombing .
we know -- - i just received word .
senator hawkins is dead .
there &apos;s no evidence the man we &apos;re holding is karakurt .
main justice verified his credentials .
he &apos;s just a reporter . maybe cooper could --
agent cooper was relieved of duty by the attorney ggeneral
until my inquiry is complete .
this is unbelievable .
so they &apos;re taking him out , too .
look , i don &apos;t know agent keen well at all .
maybe she is what they &apos;re saying she is .
but harold cooper -- you remove a man like that ,
and you get me wondering .
which is why i &apos;m naming you
as acting director of this task force .
i need a right hand on this , one i can trust .
so you want me to investigate my partner ?
you &apos;re an agent who puts a premium on doing what &apos;s right .
you want to give keen the benefit of the doubt ?
good .
but if she is guilty , i know you &apos;ll do
what it takes to hold her accountable and make the case .
sorry to interrupt .
agent keen &apos;s blood test just came in .
she tested positive for the virus
that killed senator hawkins .
i &apos;ve been relieved of duty .
i &apos;m not surprised .
and connolly &apos;s minions are questioning agent keen .
the man has the weight of the entire d.o.j. behind him
if he wants to indict her .
there won &apos;t be an indictment .
they &apos;ll rig the evidence against her ,
parade her in front of the cameras
so america can see the face of the enemy ,
and then they &apos;ll put her away someplace
where she has no chance to mount a defense .
i have to go back .
you won &apos;t be allowed in the building .
we can &apos;t just leave her there .
of course not .
we &apos;re gonna walk her right out the door .
you have someone on the inside ?
yes .
fortunately , i also have a man at the power company .
the lines will be cut
to both the main and emergency power supplies .
battery boot protocol will recycle within 60 seconds .
it will take another 30 seconds for the cameras to cycle .
that &apos;s 90 seconds for agent keen to get out .
with your guidance , harold , that &apos;s all the time she &apos;ll need .
i &apos;ll check it out . stay put .
you want me to guide her out in the dark ?
in the land of the blind , the one @-@ eyed man is king .
let me guess -- reddington &apos;s coming to break you out .
agent keen , i &apos;m to escort you to lock--
wait ! reddington sent me !
clock is ticking ! it &apos;s for you !
take it !
yes !
keen , listen closely .
you have 45 seconds before the power is up .
i need you to do exactly as i say .
team , our power supply &apos;s not responding .
reddington .
there &apos;s a door by the south stairwell .
my emergency access is 5 @-@ tango @-@ 293 .
head to the end of the hallway and make a right ,
then an immediate left .
damn it .
from the maintenance room , there &apos;s a utility ladder
that dumps into an emergency passageway .
the stairwell opens to a service corridor
connected to the loading dock .
go one block west . reddington will meet you there .
don &apos;t do this , keen .
they won &apos;t listen to me .
we &apos;ll make them listen .
did you get my blood test back ?
positive for the virus .
you see ? they can make anything look like the truth .
and if you run , what does that look like ?
if someone &apos;s setting you up ,
you &apos;re giving them exactly what they want .
you can fight this ,
but if you &apos;ve got to do it from inside the system .
in about 20 seconds , that camera &apos;s gonna turn back on .
if you &apos;re gonna let me go , you &apos;ve got to do it now ,
before people see you standing here with me .
we just missed her . got her burner .
how could i possibly be carrying the virus that killed hawkins ?
infecting you is not something they &apos;d leave to chance .
they want you alone , isolated .
in the last 24 hours , what was out of the ordinary ?
when did you change your plans , make a diversion ?
union station .
coming out of the tunnel , i was chasing karakurt .
he blindsided me .
to infect you ?
we need to pull the security tapes at union station .
if we can find footage of karakurt ,
maybe we can prove they infected me .
he &apos;s insisting .
yes ?
where &apos;s liz ? i can &apos;t reach her .
i can &apos;t help you with that .
i can keep her safe . i can help her disappear .
your assistance is not necessary .
who was that ?
tom .
tom is calling to take you away ,
start a new life with a new identity .
but if you run now , before clearing your name ,
there is no place you can go where they won &apos;t find you .
face this now , fight it ,
and you &apos;ll be free to make any choice you want .
i &apos;ll meet you back here after you get the tapes .
what are you doing ?
i have an appointment .
this is a war that must be fought on many fronts .
you have yours . i have mine .
be safe .
we have three broad @-@ spectrum frequency jammers
being off @-@ loaded now .
you want to run them from the catwalks ?
yes , space this size --
no communications will get in or out . i &apos;m confident of that .
i don &apos;t need to tell you there is no margin for error .
that &apos;s correct . you do not .
what &apos;s the word from baz ?
he &apos;s trying .
trying ?
some of the targets you selected
are thousands of miles away .
they have to be secured and transported .
i was very clear -- whatever it takes ,
whatever resources are required .
of course .
we get one chance to strike first .
we will not get another .
i &apos;m dying , agent keen .
charlene told me .
she swore me to secrecy .
i let tom connolly take advantage of that .
he offered me hope .
but in exchange , i did things for him .
you once told me
that i was the one person you completely trusted .
i violated that trust . i &apos;m sorry , elizabeth .
this ... thing you &apos;re going through ,
ever since charlene told me ,
i &apos;ve had a pit in my stomach .
i just ...
i can &apos;t imagine ...
pull yourself together , keen .
what little time i have left , i don &apos;t want to spend it
sitting in a car , blubbering with you .
okay .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
we &apos;re chasing down a lead on the recent orea bombing .
we have reason to believe
the perp fled through union station as recently as this morning .
we &apos;re gonna need to take a look at your feeds .
you got legal paper ?
subpoena ? i can &apos;t release the footage without one .
you &apos;ve got to be joking .
what ?
a subpoena ?
we &apos;ve got a terrorist out there
who just killed 14 cia agents .
he murdered a sitting u.s. senator .
and you want to talk about paperwork ?
salestrom .
this is simpson . i want to give you a heads @-@ up .
you &apos;re gonna have somebody from the bureau stopping by .
they need to have a look at surveillance .
i have someone right now .
they need to move quickly .
give her whatever she needs .
i appreciate the help .
of course .
the drives are uploaded to archive after midnight .
anything from earlier today
is gonna have to be accessed from here .
good luck .
andropov .
authorities have released this photo of the suspect ,
fbi agent elizabeth keen .
sources are confirming she is also wanted
in connection with the truck bombing
at the cia &apos;s orea facility .
it was andropov .
the virologist ? he infected you ?
he was there .
we have to find andropov and get him to talk .
i can &apos;t . i just got a call from our lawyer .
charlene &apos;s been taken in for questioning .
questioning for what ?
tom connolly . he got her to --
she leaked a classified document to the press .
but what it means is i can &apos;t .
you &apos;re gonna have to find andropov on your own .
anton velov ?
agent keen , fbi .
we spoke briefly on the phone a few days ago .
keen .
you were looking for information about katarina rostova .
is that why you &apos;re here ?
not entirely , no .
good .
because if you were , you have wasted your time .
as i told you , i never knew katarina .
i need you to tell me where i can find leo andropov .
how should i know where he is ?
you were a c.i.
for one of the orea agents that died in the bombing .
you recorded a conversation for him
that took place here in this restaurant ,
and we know andropov was a part of that conversation .
so i &apos;m gonna ask you again , where can i find him ?
there is a safe house in ivy city .
a safe house . an address ?
l street , across from olive &apos;s diner .
now , if there &apos;s nothing else ...
that &apos;s not what you told me on the phone .
you said you could help me with katarina rostova .
i don &apos;t know anything .
i told you how to find andropov .
and now i want you to tell me about her .
i can &apos;t say .
first , you don &apos;t know . now you can &apos;t say .
which is it ?
you got to him .
i retained his services .
in exchange for his silence about my mother .
harold told me the man who infected you
was the virologist andropov .
you got me out of the post office .
you gave me a chance to prove my innocence .
i know you think you care about me .
but every time you do something
that makes me think you really do ,
you do something else that reminds me
that you simply aren &apos;t capable of it .
i &apos;m a sin eater .
i absorb the misdeeds of others ,
darkening my soul to keep theirs pure .
that is what i &apos;m capable of .
what sin of mine could you possibly have absorbed ?
andropov -- do you have a lead ?
i do , and i &apos;ll handle it on my own ,
because that &apos;s what i &apos;m capable of .
liz , i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
i have a lead , something that could clear all of this up ,
but i need your help .
i went to your motel . there were cops everywhere .
it &apos;s on the tv , news reports .
there is no clearing it up , all right ?
there is only leaving it behind .
i can &apos;t .
if i run now , then i &apos;ll be looking over my shoulder
for the rest of my life .
that &apos;s reddington talking .
yes , it is . and he &apos;s right .
i can &apos;t leave now .
then i can &apos;t stay .
this lead i have -- leo andropov --
never heard of him .
he created the virus that killed hawkins . he infected me .
if we can find him , then maybe i can prove i was set up .
but i don &apos;t think i can do it on my own .
i &apos;ve got an address .
he &apos;s on the street !
it &apos;s me . i &apos;ve been made .
i &apos;m on my way to the extraction point .
turn ! up there on the right !
yeah , i see him .
you &apos;re losing him !
are you honestly telling me how to drive right now ?
yes ! i &apos;m not the one who hit a deer on the turnpike .
that was not deer blood on the windshield .
just don &apos;t lose him .
he turned down the alley . circle back .
where the hell have you been ?
we have to go now !
what are you doing ? !
no !
that &apos;s everything !
no !
oh , god !
stay with me ! come on !
my mother -- he &apos;s the only one who knew about her .
liz -- liz , he &apos;s gone .
hello , mr. hastings .
i &apos;m here on behalf of raymond reddington .
mr. chin , raymond reddington sends his regards .
last target secured , sir .
traveling to location .
what ?
what ?
today . in the alley .
what about the alley ?
it &apos;s the weirdest thing .
in that moment with the bullets flying and the glass ...
one thing kept running through my head .
&quot; the boat , the boat .
why didn &apos;t you just get on his boat ? &quot;
tell me what to do .
you &apos;re still bleeding .
i &apos;m fine .
tom , i said i was fine .
i know you did .
that hurt ?
what is it ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t want to regret anything .
what could you possibly regret ?
not saying yes .
yes to what ?
you .
take me with you .
don &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m here . all we have to do is go .
liz , if you go away with me ,
you &apos;ll never get answers .
you &apos;ll never find out who you really are .
i don &apos;t need to know who i am to know what i want .
what do you want , liz ?
you .
at this hour ,
police continue their search for fbi agent elizabeth keen ,
who authorities have named a person of interest
in the death of senator clifford hawkins .
you have a gun or are you just happy to see me ?
the flash drive that we found in andropov &apos;s safe house --
it &apos;s full of records , including documents about cooper .
cooper .
yeah .
his medical records , test results ,
medications , the -- the senator ,
the bombing .
liz , slow down .
cooper &apos;s doctor works for the cabal .
i &apos;ll be back .
no , you won &apos;t .
i got to ...
tom ...
go .
agent cooper .
agent cooper , it &apos;s keen . i need to see you .
it &apos;s about your doctor .
the dye we inserted highlighted --
who do you work for ? get out ! - harold , i &apos;m in the middle of a --
harold -- - i know about andropov .
that the drugs you gave me came from him .
there never was a clinical trial , was there ?
no , no .
it was all a lie .
please , please , please !
please , they -- they threatened my family .
you family ? and what about my family ?
you made me believe i was getting cured !
no , no , no .
i made you believe you were sick .
say that again ?
you &apos;re not sick .
the test results ,
the brain scans -- i saw the tumor .
no , you saw a tumor , but it wasn &apos;t yours .
the mris , the cat scans , the blood tests --
it was all fake !
you &apos;re lying to me .
no , no , no ! i &apos;m not ! i &apos;m not !
but i felt sick . i needed a cane .
y @-@ yes . and -- and then you didn &apos;t .
it was the medicine .
andropov -- he --
he designed it so that you &apos;d manifest
the symptoms of a glioblastoma .
then he altered your dosage
to make you think the trial was working .
i don &apos;t know why he did it , but he did .
you have to believe me .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
my name is raymond reddington .
the united states government has placed me
at top the country &apos;s list of most @-@ wanted fugitives
for a colorful and not uninteresting assortment of crimes ,
most of which i have committed .
that &apos;s who i am .
you , in turn , are by my estimation
11 of the finest investigative journalists in the world .
i &apos;m here to tell you a story .
i &apos;m sure you recognize many of the faces behind me .
they are among the most powerful men and women on the planet .
they are also part of a global conspiracy ,
a shadow organization that spans across every continent
and has for the last three decades ,
consisting of leaders in world government
and the private sector .
some call this group &quot; the cabal . &quot;
the world you live in
is the world they want you to think you live in .
they start wars , create chaos .
and when it suits them , they resolve it .
cabal members will move more money in the next quarter
than the world bank will in the next year .
their alliance effects sea change
in every aspect of human life --
the value and distribution of commodities ,
money , weapons , water , fuel ,
the food we eat to live ,
the information we rely on to tell us who we are .
what exactly do you expect us to do with this information ?
study it , investigate it to determine the truth ,
and then report it .
let me be clear .
investigating this group
will immediately position you as a threat .
if you do what i &apos;m asking , you &apos;ll be putting your lives
and the lives of those you love at grave risk .
in the end , &quot; the truth will out . &quot;
not all of us will live to see that day ,
but the truth will out .
tom , we need to talk .
i don &apos;t think we have anything to say to each other .
i spoke with dr. levin .
he recorded your conversations .
you got a lot of chutzpah coming here .
oh , he &apos;s got much more than that .
i have my health .
what a miracle -- cancer free .
but then , you know that , don &apos;t you , tom ?
how quickly fortunes can turn .
i wouldn &apos;t call your security .
not until you &apos;ve heard what we have to say .
we have the tapes -- recordings that prove
you blackmailed dr. levin into falsifying my medical records .
so here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
you &apos;re gonna make this go away , all of it .
you &apos;re gonna exonerate me by prosecuting karakurt ,
the real killer of those 14 agents and senator hawkins .
you &apos;re going to agree not to press charges against charlene .
you &apos;re going to reinstate agent cooper ,
and you &apos;re going to convey to the director
that he is not to touch raymond reddington .
why would i agree to any of that ?
because if you refuse , we &apos;ll take the evidence to the bureau .
i own the bureau .
then we &apos;ll go to a federal judge .
good luck .
a river of influence runs deep ,
or have you forgotten how easily we made judge denner
suppress first @-@ degree murder charges against you , agent keen .
look around . why do you think i &apos;m here ?
there &apos;s a banquet tonight , fraternal order of police .
i &apos;m the keynote speaker .
four hours from now , i &apos;m going to be on that stage ,
announcing that my office has secured an indictment
against the members of a rogue task force .
this task force was authorized by the fbi and the d.o.j.
by my predecessor at the d.o.j.
you &apos;re going to prison , agent keen .
donald ressler-- his little oxy addiction
will get him drummed out of the bureau .
samar navabi will be extradited to iran ,
where she will stand trial for
the murder of one of their top nuclear scientists .
charlene , harold , even agent mojtabai .
we have a little something in mind for all of you ,
including treason charges and the death penalty for reddington .
so are we finished here ?
because i think it &apos;s cocktail hour .
what are you gonna do , agent keen-- arrest me ?
keen , put it down .
i am nothing . i am a cog in a very large wheel .
shoot me , and somebody at least as powerful
will take my place .
you just won &apos;t know who .
agent keen , you do this ,
you become everything they say you are .
i can &apos;t let him .
elizabeth , listen to me .
that conversation we had in my hospital room ,
the good person i told you i didn &apos;t want to lose ...
the agent you were before all of this--
you do this , and she &apos;s gone .
keen ...
run .
excuse me .
ressler ?
where the hell are you ?
listen to me .
harold cooper-- he had nothing to do with this .
you need to turn yourself in .
did you hear me ? he &apos;s innocent .
you are a wanted fugitive .
you murdered the attorney general of the united states .
you have to come in .
i can &apos;t .
damn it , liz , wake up .
you keep running , you will be hunted down .
i know .
by me .
don &apos;t make me do this .
please , liz , tell me where you are .
tell me , and i can get--
lizzy .
i need your help .
where are you ?
i killed tom connolly .
i know . where are you ?
i &apos;m on ... 7th and l , northeast .
i &apos;m gonna call you back in two minutes with an address .
i need you to get there . i &apos;m gonna get you out .
it &apos;s me . i need to travel .
i remember .
i remember everything .
remember what ?
the night of the fire .
i know what happened ,
and i understand why you didn &apos;t want me to find out .
when i pulled the trigger ...
when i shot connolly , i ...
it came back to me .
it was like i was there .
i could hear them arguing .
he was hurting her .
