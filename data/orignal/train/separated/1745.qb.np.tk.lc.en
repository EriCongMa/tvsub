almost there . you &apos;re doing great .
thanks for lifting my spirits .
next time , try lifting the box .
i don &apos;t need a treadmill !
the doctor says you need to get exercise !
i get plenty of exercise !
crushing my will to live isn &apos;t exercise !
if she isn &apos;t gonna use it , then why are we doing this ?
she &apos;ll use it .
all i need is to rig it
with a fishing pole and a honeybaked ham .
all right .
now what ?
we set it up in howie &apos;s old room .
do you know how to set it up ?
please , i &apos;m an mit @-@ trained engineer .
i think i can handle ...
ma , look out !
i told you this thing would kill me !
so she &apos;s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks .
poor mrs. wolowitz .
should we do something for her ?
i know .
let &apos;s go see the new spider @-@ man movie .
sheldon , we &apos;re talking about your friend &apos;s mother .
she got hurt .
i thought that subject had run its course ,
so i changed it .
it &apos;s called reading the room , amy .
hi .
hey , how were things on the set ?
uh , pretty good , actually .
so the movie &apos;s not as bad as you thought ?
oh , no , it is ,
but i decided , instead of complaining about it ,
i &apos;m just gonna go in every day and give it my all .
good for you .
thanks .
there &apos;s no reason why i shouldn &apos;t be
the best bisexual go @-@ go dancer slowly transforming
into a killer gorilla anyone &apos;s ever seen .
i don &apos;t know .
the bisexual gorilla go @-@ go dancer in schindler &apos;s list
is tough to beat .
ah , very good .
because a gorilla go @-@ go dancer of any sexual preference
would be out of place in a film about the holocaust .
it only gets funnier when you explain it , sheldon .
i know .
okay , she &apos;s all settled in the guest room .
maybe we should get one of those machines
to help her up the stairs .
you mean a forklift ?
howie ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i just can &apos;t deal with this right now .
taking care of your own mother ? how can you say that ?
bernie , she &apos;s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks .
are you prepared to feed her , wash her
and take her to the toilet ?
i would do it for my mother .
yeah , of course you would--
you &apos;re a loving person .
i &apos;m what my people would call a putz .
look , i &apos;m not crazy about the idea ,
but what other choice do we have ?
we get a nurse .
preferably someone from a third world country
who &apos;s used to suffering and unpleasant smells .
you &apos;d hire a total stranger
to take care of the woman who raised you ?
that &apos;s so cruel .
not if we pay them well
and let them listen to the music of their homeland .
i need to tinkle !
sounds like a job for a loving person .
would you like me to play some polish music
while you carry her to the toilet ?
you are a putz .
as advertised .
thanks for coming with me .
thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no .
aren &apos;t you gonna get 3 @-@ d glasses ?
i brought my own .
no sense in risking bridge @-@ of @-@ nose herpes .
is that a real thing ?
well , until they invent nose condoms ,
i &apos;m not finding out .
emily ! hey !
oh , hey , raj .
uh , this is my friend , sheldon .
sheldon , this is emily .
oh , yes , you &apos;re the dermatologist .
i went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen .
do you see anything on my forehead
that i should be concerned about ?
um , you know what ? i better go .
my movie &apos;s about to start .
are you here alone ?
no , not really .
what do you mean , &quot; not really &quot; ?
hey , should we get our seats ?
yeah .
it was nice seeing you . um , i &apos;ll call you later .
yeah , okay .
that was awkward , right ?
is it because she &apos;s dating you
but was out with that other fellow ?
yes .
good . i thought she saw something on my forehead .
and ... action .
please don &apos;t shut me out .
go away .
just go away .
i swear , i will find a way to turn you back .
what gave you the right
to mix my dna with that of a killer gorilla ?
i was trying to save your life .
life ? what life ? look at me ! i &apos;m a monster !
and now i have blood on my hands , or
paws . i don &apos;t know .
you can &apos;t give up . i love you .
i love you , too .
but i &apos;m afraid i love killing more .
like , one day , i might actually try and kill you !
and ... cut . all right .
all right , let &apos;s set up for the next scene .
actually , you know what ? can we do one more ?
i think i could do it better .
let &apos;s just move on .
no one cares .
well , i care .
i mean , look , if we &apos;re gonna do this ,
why not try and make it something we &apos;re actually proud of ?
look , sweetie ,
this movie is garbage ,
but you should be happy about that ,
&apos;cause if it was a good movie , you wouldn &apos;t be in it .
whoa , whoa , hang on .
there &apos;s no need to insult her .
and who are you ?
i &apos;m her boyfriend .
isn &apos;t she too hot for you ?
a little , yeah .
well , boyfriend , get off my set .
you can &apos;t do that . he &apos;s with me .
you know what ? you can get off my set , too .
you &apos;re fired .
what ? you can &apos;t fire me . i &apos;m the star .
i &apos;m the girl that goes bananas . it says so on the poster .
yeah , but we just shot the last scene where we see your face .
so from now own , the star of the movie is whoever wears this .
hey , if you &apos;re gonna fire her ,
then you have to fire me , too .
wow , that fell apart really fast .
thanks for skipping the movie .
i couldn &apos;t sit in that theater for two hours
wondering about emily and that guy .
oh , quite all right .
after my forehead melanoma scare ,
i &apos;ve learned not to sweat the small stuff .
well , sorry ,
i don &apos;t have all the ingredients to make chai tea .
you don &apos;t have to make me anything .
no , i do . you &apos;re upset about emily
and you &apos;re indian .
i need to make you chai tea .
now , i have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds .
do you happen to have any on you ?
sorry , i left them in my turban .
oh , i &apos;ll make english breakfast tea .
they destroyed your culture .
that &apos;s close enough .
you know , i &apos;m curious ,
why are you so upset about seeing emily with another man ?
wouldn &apos;t you be upset if you saw amy out with someone else ?
can &apos;t happen .
we have an ironclad relationship agreement
which precludes her from physical contact
with anyone other than me .
but you don &apos;t have sex with her , either .
slick , huh ?
to be truthful , emily and i haven &apos;t dated that long ,
and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other .
have you had intercourse ?
no .
well , stick to your guns .
there will be a lot of pressure .
i &apos;m hungry again !
it &apos;s like the world &apos;s fattest cuckoo clock .
you know , you &apos;re always talking about having a baby someday .
this is exactly what it &apos;s gonna be like .
no , it &apos;s not .
come on . the constant fussing , eating , pooping ,
burping , drooling .
we &apos;re even waiting for the day
when she can finally walk on her own .
maybe you &apos;re right .
anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth .
i &apos;m just telling you now , if we do have kids ,
don &apos;t expect me to do all the work .
hey , i &apos;m a very paternal person .
i &apos;d be excellent at taking care of a baby .
i &apos;m still hungry !
i &apos;m coming , you big baby !
you know , the only thing worse than doing a movie
where they glue monkey hair to your ass
is getting fired from a movie
where they glue monkey hair to your ass .
forget it , man , it &apos;s crap .
you just move on to the next thing .
yeah , well , it &apos;s easy for you to say .
you used to be famous .
hey . i just lost a job for you .
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re famous .
penny , it &apos;s not about being famous .
it &apos;s about the art .
it &apos;s about the passion we have for our craft .
i have an audition for sharknado 2 !
if i book this , i am totally gonna pay you back for this beer .
god , what am i doing with my life ?
you having second thoughts about acting ?
you were on set , you saw what it was like .
yeah , but it &apos;s not always that bad .
oh , really ?
what about when you did , uh ,
anne frank at that cute little theater ?
it was over a bowling alley .
yeah , but ...
there was ample parking .
are you done ?
and you were so good in the tv commercial .
it was for hemorrhoid cream .
and i got itchy and swollen just watching you .
leonard , you are really not cheering me up .
come on .
how can you be sad when you &apos;re going home
with all five @-@ foot @-@ six of this ?
you think you &apos;re five @-@ foot @-@ six , that &apos;s funny .
i don &apos;t understand it .
i &apos;m a nice guy ,
i have a great job ,
i &apos;m well @-@ educated ,
come from a good family ...
why don &apos;t women want to be with me ?
an interesting question .
well ...
good night .
don &apos;t send me home .
i can &apos;t be alone right now .
that &apos;s your problem .
you can &apos;t be alone .
what do you mean ?
how many women have you had dates with ?
eleven .
how many of those women
did you think would become your perfect companion ?
eleven .
wait .
do i count the 200 @-@ pound sailor moon girl
that howard and i had a threesome with at comic con ?
sure .
i &apos;ll stick with 11 .
she liked howard better .
well , now do you see the problem ?
maybe .
i ... i don &apos;t know .
you ... it &apos;s late , i @-@ i should ...
i should go .
look , i @-@ i do get what you &apos;re saying .
instead of desperately clinging
to any woman who will go out with me ,
i need to work on my fear of being alone .
i was trying to suggest chemical castration , but ...
... it &apos;s my bedtime ,
so whatever gets you out the door . good night .
howie , i &apos;m back !
shh @-@ shh @-@ shh , i just got her to sleep .
sorry .
what took you so long ?
the grocery store is a few blocks away .
they only had regular yogurt .
i had to go to a different store
to get the extra @-@ fat kind your mom likes .
then why do i smell coffee on your breath ?
so what ?
after two days of taking care of her ,
excuse me for stopping to get a mocha .
a mocha ?
well , it must be nice to be queen .
queen ?
i &apos;ve been killing myself here !
well , whose fault is that ?
i wanted to get a nurse , but you were all ,
&quot; i &apos;m nice . i want to take care of people . &quot;
i &apos;m glad i got that mocha .
and you know what else i &apos;m glad about ?
i bought you a brownie and i ate it in the car !
howard !
thanks a lot .
now i have to go rub her belly again .
thanks for letting me come over .
of course .
please , come in .
i just wanted to say
how sorry i am about tonight , and ...
i want to make sure that we &apos;re okay .
uh , look , you and i haven &apos;t made
any commitments to each other .
i know .
i just felt like i needed to explain .
the guy i was with did my last tattoo ,
and he &apos;s been asking me out for months .
i finally said yes just to get it over with .
it &apos;s okay .
really ?
well , i mean , yeah , it freaked me out a little ,
but that &apos;s my issue , not yours .
if i saw you out with another woman ,
i &apos;d be pretty upset .
thank you .
not just for being upset ,
but for believing that could happen .
just so you know , i &apos;m not seeing anyone else .
well , me , neither .
okay .
okay .
please .
so , uh ... you ... you have tattoos ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t .
i have a hole in my belly button
that may or may not have been a piercing .
that &apos;s cool .
it &apos;s a piercing .
so , uh ...
how many tattoos ?
one on my shoulder ,
one not on my shoulder
and one really not on my shoulder .
it &apos;s , uh ...
been a long time since i &apos;ve seen a girl &apos;s ...
really not her shoulder .
well ... how about you show me your piercing
and i show you my tattoos ?
but , uh , before i take my shirt off ,
i just need like ten minutes to do some crunches .
oh , my god .
what a day .
can i get you anything ?
no .
i need to start making some smart decisions .
with your career ?
with my life .
like what ?
i don &apos;t know .
we could get married .
come on , be serious .
i am .
why ?
because i &apos;m a @-@ a &quot; smart decision &quot; ?
well , yeah .
so i &apos;m like a bran muffin .
what ... no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
no , it &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re saying .
i &apos;m the boring thing you &apos;re choosing
because i &apos;m good for you .
what does it matter ?
the point is , i &apos;m choosing you .
well , it matters a lot !
i don &apos;t want to be a bran muffin .
i @-@ i want to be a ...
cinnabon , you know ?
a strawberry pop @-@ tart .
something you &apos;re excited about
even though it could give you diabetes .
sweetie , you can be any pastry you want .
no , no . no , it &apos;s too late .
i @-@ i &apos;m your bran muffin .
probably fat @-@ free and good for your colon .
you know what ? forget it .
i never should &apos;ve brought it up .
you know i want to marry you ,
but you &apos;re only doing this because you got fired
and you &apos;re feeling sorry for yourself .
okay , it may look that way , but getting fired from that movie
was the best thing that could have happened to me , okay ?
i finally realize i don &apos;t need to be famous
or have some big career to be happy .
then what do you need ?
you , you stupid pop @-@ tart !
then i guess i &apos;m in .
really ?
you &quot; guess you &apos;re in &quot; ?
not like , &quot; i guess i &apos;m in . &quot;
like &quot; i guess ... i &apos;m in ! &quot;
okay .
cool .
so is that it ?
are ... are we engaged ?
yeah , i think so .
all right .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m not sure .
just ... feels a little anticlimactic .
yeah , it kind of does , huh ?
oh , i know .
this might help .
where did you get a ring ?
i &apos;ve ...
had it for a couple years , not important .
penny ...
will you marry me ?
oh , my god , yes .
this would have been so much more romantic
if you didn &apos;t have monkey hair on your finger .
how you feeling ?
last night was a little rough ,
but i think we &apos;re gonna get through this .
i &apos;m proud of us .
me , too .
where &apos;s my pancakes ? !
coming , mrs. wolowitz !
you were right .
welcome to team putz .
