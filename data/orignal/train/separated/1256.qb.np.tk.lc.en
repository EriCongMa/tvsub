hanna is not picking up , and she &apos;s not with mona .
or caleb , but she did drop by his place
last night to tell him that she would be going
off the grid for a couple of days .
she &apos;s gonna do something to noel .
布置
maybe we could just skip the headache
and inevitable parental drama and just elope .
we could be wine tasting under the tuscan sun by friday .
jordan and i broke up .
are we still friends ?
always .
it &apos;s happening again .
noel kahn .
he &apos;s the one doing this to us .
can you come over ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
i &apos;m agent lee from the federal bureau of investigation .
you were involved with nicole gordon ?
yes , i was .
we have reason to believe that she may be alive .
did ezra get to colombia okay ?
yeah .
妮可不是人质之一 我明天回家
any news about nicole ?
spencer . what happened ?
are you okay ?
someone &apos;s in the house .
that &apos;s noel &apos;s parents &apos; cabin .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s the same area where hanna was held captive .
but i thought his parents sold this place years ago .
god only knows what &apos;s inside .
hopefully , the evidence we need to finally end this thing .
noel kahn was there the whole time ?
we may not be able to prove that he tortured hanna
but this proves that he tortured us .
i knew you &apos;d eventually slip up .
the cellphone was a big screw @-@ up .
be careful , hanna , or you &apos;ll end up just like sara .
if we do this , there &apos;s no stepping back from it .
and we risk the police finding out about archer .
you mean , finding out that hanna ran him over
and you buried him like a dog ?
to quote my dead husband , &quot; karma &apos;s a bitch . &quot;
it was an accident .
and we knew how it looked .
we did it to protect hanna .
who &apos;s currently our resident girl gone rogue .
i &apos;m trying her one last time .
let &apos;s just ping her cell and go get her .
i gave her a new phone , okay ? you can &apos;t hack it .
why isn &apos;t she picking up ?
because noel probably has her locked up
in another slaughtering hole .
hey , it &apos;s hanna .
leave a message .
let &apos;s just call the cops , okay .
tell them everything you just
told us about jenna and noel .
and sara harvey .
none of us believes that was an accident .
i &apos;m heading to the radley . maybe jenna will lead us to noel .
do we call furey or 911 ?
noel is out there somewhere , and he might have hanna .
911 . what is your emergency ?
i think my friend &apos;s been abducted .
wake up , bitch .
noel , please !
please open the door ! you can &apos;t leave me in here !
i &apos;m begging you ! please !
this is your chance to tell me the truth .
just admit it .
admit you &apos;re a.d.
fine .
we &apos;ll do it my way .
第七季 第十集
i want an update as soon as they get to kahn &apos;s lakehouse .
and i want mary drake found and brought in for questioning .
his stepsister hasn &apos;t left the radley since yesterday morning .
we verified her story with hotel security .
keep a tail on her .
not sure how much of a threat a blind girl can be .
you haven &apos;t met jenna .
look , i was hoping to buy you a beer after your shift
but doesn &apos;t look like that &apos;s gonna happen .
well , today doesn &apos;t have to be my last day .
i @-@ i can ...
toby .
i know that you and spencer are old friends
but i promise you
nothing &apos;s gonna happen to those women on my watch .
excuse me , detective furey ?
if i don &apos;t see you later ...
thank you for your service .
you guys , it was mona . the cops questioned jenna .
well , did they arrest her ?
no , she &apos;s still at the radley .
you say that like it &apos;s a good thing .
well , yeah , i mean , she can &apos;t lead us to noel if she &apos;s locked up .
i &apos;m gonna go meet up with mona .
call us if you hear anything .
i &apos;m sorry that i lied to you last night .
i should have told you about noel . i was just scared .
you don &apos;t have to apologize , spencer .
i did my homework on you right after we met .
i read about charlotte and the bunker .
and now to find out that noel was helping her
keep you down there ?
i got an apb out on kahn , and i &apos;m bringing him in
and we &apos;re gonna find hanna ... today .
thank you .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so sorry . did i just do that ?
yeah , well , it &apos;s okay .
oh , god . i &apos;m sorry .
just don &apos;t let it happen again .
at least not here .
the police are looking for hanna marin .
any information regarding her whereabouts
should be directed to the rosewood police department .
hanna marin , blonde , blue @-@ eyed , and 23 years old has not ...
i &apos;m gonna go call hanna &apos;s mom . she &apos;s at a conference in london .
i just , i don &apos;t know where she &apos;s staying .
friends and family first contacted the police
after marin stopped answering her cell phone
and failed to return to her home .
so what &apos;s the rush , if you don &apos;t mind me asking ?
trying to prove somebody &apos;s your baby daddy ?
something like that .
i can get you the results by tomorrow .
i am telling you , noel , the cops are all over me .
they think you have hanna . do you ?
just call me , okay ?
jenna &apos;s left three messages for noel since i &apos;ve been here .
she doesn &apos;t know where he is .
so did noel double @-@ cross her ..
or did hanna get to him first ?
oh , yeah . that &apos;s right ...
they sent out a final search crew
but i think that &apos;s mainly to appease the people
that came down here hoping , like me .
ezra , i &apos;m sorry .
i get why you deleted the call .
no one should have to mourn someone twice .
so i &apos;ll pick you up from the airport .
we can go to that diner that you like
the place with the sugar @-@ cream pie .
that &apos;s okay . i can take a cab .
but if you don &apos;t have any plans , i would really like it
if you &apos;re home when i got there .
i &apos;ll see you tonight then .
i love you .
i love you too .
hanna marin , white female , blonde
mid twenties , is now considered a missing person
possibly abducted by one noel kahn
white male , also mid twenties .
he should be considered dangerous and possibly armed .
i need your help , and i need you to come alone .
i &apos;m sorry to rope you in like this
but when i saw the news , i didn &apos;t know who else to call .
well , next time , call me before you abduct someone
and go on the run . it just makes my life a little easier .
when do you get the test results ?
not till tomorrow .
what are you doing ?
looking for this .
what is that ?
you seriously haven &apos;t spoken to anyone ?
well , i &apos;ve kinda had my hands full .
there is footage on here that proves
that noel was working with charlotte .
he was part of the dollhouse .
what ?
i was worried he destroyed it , but clearly you knocked him out
before he had the chance to .
look , hanna , you don &apos;t need the test results .
this is more than enough to put noel behind bars .
no .
what do you mean no ?
busting noel for the dollhouse
is like busting a mob boss for tax evasion .
it &apos;s settling ..
and i &apos;m not ready to settle .
but , hanna , you can &apos;t get any worse than the dollhouse .
i have scars on my back that say different .
i want noel to be held accountable
for everything he did .
i &apos;m gonna prove he &apos;s a.d.
i need to .
blonde female , early twenties ,
blue eyes , 5 &apos; 7 .. &quot;
please .
help me . i just need to stay hidden for ten more hours .
that &apos;s the last thing you &apos;re gonna do .
thanks , paige .
stay as long as you &apos;d like .
here .
thanks .
i also have some breakfast stuff
in here if you &apos;re hungry .
i couldn &apos;t be more nauseated .
how much longer are we gonna be penned up in here like veal ?
furey says we can &apos;t leave until they find noel .
well , it &apos;s hard enough going through this
without being gawked at .
you mean , paige ? i invited her .
why ? she has nothing to do with this .
she &apos;s here to support us .
don &apos;t forget , she was targeted by &quot; a &quot; when--
fine , i just think it &apos;s a little pathetic
that she &apos;s using us to get close to you .
doesn &apos;t she know that you &apos;re dating someone ?
yeah , well
things with sabrina are kind of on pause .
i can &apos;t talk to her about this .
em , it &apos;s all over the news .
and i know i &apos;ll have to deal with it , okay .
but it &apos;s easier with paige . she &apos;s been through this before .
she understands it and me .
guys , looks like something &apos;s happening .
maybe they found hanna .
oh , i &apos;m gonna be sick .
thank you for the update , greg .
let &apos;s go ahead and alert the state troopers too .
what &apos;s going on ?
the officers who went to the kahn lakehouse
found two sets of footprints .
there was a struggle .
it looks bad , i know
but i wanted to prove to my friends and to all of you
that noel is the person who &apos;s been tormenting us ..
... so i went to holly brook to find the girl
he pushed down the stairs .
if i could get her to talk
we &apos;d have a credible witness .
unfortunately , i couldn &apos;t track her down .
i &apos;m just so sorry that i worried everybody
by disappearing like that .
i wasn &apos;t thinking .
you &apos;ve gotten really good at this .
do you think the cops will buy it ?
definitely . it &apos;s your friends you need to worry about .
they &apos;re way harder to fool .
god , i hate lying to them .
you &apos;re doing them a favor by not getting them involved .
thank you again , mona .
are you sure you &apos;re able to handle--
don &apos;t worry . i got my end covered .
so why don &apos;t you run it through for me one more time ?
it looks bad ..
... i know , i &apos;m just so sorry i worried everybody
by disappearing like that .
i wasn &apos;t thinking .
well , since we opened up an investigation
i &apos;m gonna have to have you sign a written statement .
sure .
hanna , you should have called us .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry again .
guys , what &apos;s going on ?
hey , caleb .
all units , please be advised
hanna marin has been found alive .
still rocking that jungle red ?
i &apos;m not fickle . when i find what works for me , i stick with it .
well , the trick is knowing
when something isn &apos;t working for you anymore .
enough with the makeup tips .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m here to make an offer
a one @-@ time @-@ only get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card .
stop looking for noel , leave those girls alone
and get the first greyhound out of town .
and why would i do that ?
because , bonnie ,
clyde &apos;s gonna be in police custody real soon
and my hunch is , he &apos;s gonna sing like a canary .
it sounds like i &apos;d be better off sticking around .
not if you want us to say you had nothing to do with it .
mom , i &apos;m telling you , it was all a misunderstanding .
thanks , officer .
no , don &apos;t go on the plane .
go to your conference .
alright . i love you .
did she calm down ?
yeah , she &apos;s gonna stay there .
thanks for bringing me home .
are you okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
yeah .
i told you guys what happened .
i know . i know .
so then why do you keep asking me if i &apos;m okay ?
i guess i &apos;m waiting for an answer that i believe .
i &apos;m okay .
sorry , i don &apos;t buy that .
seriously . caleb , you can go , alright .
there &apos;s a cop right outside my door , and he &apos;s not moving .
well , neither am i.
seriously .
what are you talking about ?
hanna , the last time i left you in a room alone
a.d. took you .
so i hate to break it to you , girl
but you &apos;re stuck with me .
well , i really want to be left alone .
why ? do you have somewhere you need to be ?
you know , you are a real pain in the ass .
so are you .
excuse me ?
hanna , you don &apos;t do dishes until they mold .
you eat french fries in bed , cold .
you don &apos;t gas up the car until it starts beeping .
you won &apos;t admit that we &apos;re meant to spend
the rest of our lives together .
you send food back if the waiter breathes on it funny .
and you know what , there &apos;s probably milk in that fridge
that &apos;s older than me .
what did you say ?
about the milk ?
no .
i never want to spend another day without you ..
... ever , for the rest of my life .
like i said , you &apos;re a real pain in the ass .
thanks again for letting me crash here .
seeing hanna and caleb together ,
i thought it &apos;d be a good idea
to just give them some alone time .
i @-@ i can &apos;t shake the feeling
that hanna &apos;s not telling us the truth .
i mean , do you really think that she would go off the grid
just so we wouldn &apos;t know ?
i &apos;m pregnant .
what ?
i &apos;m pregnant .
i just ..
in there .
are you sure ?
there &apos;s two lines on the stick .
i was waiting for one to disappear , but it didn &apos;t .
at first , i thought i was just stressed ..
... i mean , like before , but it was a false alarm .
is it ... archer &apos;s ?
of course . who else would it be ?
oh , my god . i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
i thought we were careful .
look , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
it &apos;s not how i pictured starting a family .
you don &apos;t have to make any decisions right now .
i know .
i just ..
i thought my mom would be here when this happened ..
... to give me advice .
not that she was very good at it .
at least i wouldn &apos;t be alone .
no . you &apos;re not alone .
i &apos;m here , okay , whatever you decide to do .
hey , you &apos;re still in the air right now
but i just wanted to let you know
that when you get home , there &apos;s ..
... there &apos;s gonna be a cop outside your door
and i , i didn &apos;t want you to freak out .
i &apos;ll explain everything when you get here .
i can &apos;t wait to see you .
i just checked in with dispatch .
wherever noel is , he &apos;s not gonna be stupid enough
to try anything tonight .
i personally placed an officer
on every one of your doorsteps .
thank you .
i &apos;m taking the night shift .
eating dinner alone in the squad car &apos;s kinda depressing
so i got extra hoping you might join me .
dinner ?
yeah .
here ?
well , we could both eat in the squad car .
i can &apos;t turn down sarno &apos;s . what did you get ?
two orders of spaghetti bolognese .
that &apos;s actually my favorite .
and i also got you a cherry soda
with crushed not cubed ice .
how did you know that ?
one of your friends might have helped me out .
was it toby ?
i don &apos;t snitch on my informants .
hey , hang on , hang on . i &apos;m coming along too .
no , please .
you can &apos;t get off now .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
ali ..
... you &apos;re really vulnerable right now .
that &apos;s not why .
i promise .
his plane landed hours ago .
i &apos;m just asking you to tell me if he got on the--
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t do that .
like i said , it &apos;s against our--
don &apos;t you understand ? he &apos;s not answering his phone .
he could be lying in a ditch somewhere .
i understand that , ma &apos;am .
but i &apos;m not authorized to give out that information--
i &apos;m his fiance !
... to a spouse or a family member .
i can transfer to our manager , lisa ridenour
but she &apos;s very tough , and i &apos;m sure ..
miracle that friends and family prayed for .
nicole gordon , one of the 15 american aid workers
that went missing from the southwestern region
of colombia three years ago , has been found alive .
today , through tears of joy
nicole reunited with loved ones
after a rescue mission led by
two us agencies was successful .
... prayed for .
nicole gordon , one of the 15 american aid workers
that went missing from the southwestern region
of colombia three years ago , has been found alive .
so you thought that you could leave without saying goodbye ?
you know i hate goodbyes .
i do .
is yvonne in the house ?
no , she , um
she went to go pick up some more boxes
but i thought you were supposed to be on lockdown .
i &apos;m with a cop .
former cop .
well , furey said he would make an exception .
i bet it &apos;s just for you , though .
so this is it ?
for now , yeah
this is , uh , this is it .
this is the one from your nightstand .
i wanted you to have it .
i &apos;m really , really happy for you , toby .
you deserve love .
you deserve that kind of great , big , beautiful love ..
more than anyone else i know .
thank you .
i hope that you find the same .
me too .
toby .
can i kiss you ?
just one last time ?
just to say goodbye ?
can i help you ?
i &apos;m here to see emily fields .
yeah . what is this regarding ?
i need to talk to my friend .
you &apos;ll have to call her on the phone .
she &apos;s not answering her phone .
i was here yesterday . my name &apos;s paige .
ask detective furey . he &apos;ll tell you .
detective furey &apos;s unavailable
and i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t let you in .
i only will stay for a second .
can i at least buzz the intercom ?
no , i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am .
please , i just have to drop
something off for my girlfriend .
i &apos;ll be a sec .
paige .
hi . he &apos;s giving me such a hard time about seeing you .
why are you here so early ? is everything okay ?
yeah , today is just the deadline
for our job paperwork to be turned in .
didn &apos;t want you to miss it .
thanks .
did you sleep well last night ?
yeah , uh ..
ali &apos;s kind of having a rough time .
i think you &apos;re all kind of going through a rough time .
are you allowed to go out and get some breakfast ?
i actually should get back .
i , i &apos;d let you in , but it &apos;s not a good time .
unbelievable .
paige , come on .
nothing has changed , has it , em ?
look , i can &apos;t talk about it right now
but ali &apos;s going through something
and she needs me right now .
yeah ? what about what you need ?
no , she &apos;s , she @-@ she &apos;s in trouble .
no , she isn &apos;t .
she saw us getting close again
and now she &apos;s trying to drive a wedge in between us .
ali is the same person that she always used to be .
she doesn &apos;t want anyone happy unless it &apos;s on her terms .
paige , don &apos;t walk away .
i have to because you &apos;re still
controlled by her . it &apos;s like you &apos;re her puppet .
no , that &apos;s not what &apos;s happening .
if you just gave me a chance to explain--
you know what , call me when you finally decide
to cut the strings .
do you have the results ?
yeah , they &apos;re not a match .
what ? are you sure ?
we tested the sample you gave
against the dna you provided , and they don &apos;t match .
is there anyway that you made a mistake ?
no , those two people are not related .
okay , so there &apos;s no way that you dropped ketchup from your hotdog
or one of the hairs from your beard fell in there ?
uh , i don &apos;t have a beard .
look , you have to be wrong .
we didn &apos;t make a mistake .
they &apos;re not a match . i &apos;m sorry .
so you just decided to go rogue ?
well , i was sure noel was our guy
and you guys were just getting cold feet .
hanna , if by cold feet you mean
we weren &apos;t willing to abduct someone
and beat a confession out of them
then , yes , we got cold feet .
i &apos;m sorry .
i thought if i did this on my own
i could prove to you guys that noel was a.d.
i cannot but notice you keep talking in the past tense .
well , there is a problem .
what problem ?
i was wrong .
i got the test results back
and noel isn &apos;t mary &apos;s second child .
he isn &apos;t ?
no .
so you &apos;re saying he &apos;s not a.d. ?
well , i &apos;m not really saying that either .
what are you saying , hanna ?
i &apos;m saying i have noel tied up
to a chair in an old motel room
and we need to deal with that .
so we &apos;re we again ?
guys , forget about the blood test .
noel pushed a girl down a flight of stairs
and tormented us in the dollhouse .
emily &apos;s right , just because he &apos;s not mary &apos;s kid
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not a.d.
how do we know for sure ?
well , why don &apos;t we ask noel ?
together ?
it &apos;s worth a try .
okay , and how are we supposed to get past the cops ?
we can &apos;t exactly take them with us
and they &apos;re not about to let us go on a field trip .
well , they check the perimeter every 15 minutes
so we just have to wait until it gets dark and then sneak out .
you don &apos;t think they &apos;re gonna notice
that it &apos;s dead quiet in here ?
you guys , we all need to calm down and stop freaking out .
my brain hurts . i need food .
there &apos;s ramen noodles in the cupboard . go nuts .
how can you even think about food right now ?
noel is out there somewhere .
and i personally won &apos;t be able to breathe
until he &apos;s found .
you did remember to , like , water and feed him , right ?
of course .
did you remember to tie him up ?
oh , my god .
oh , this is bad , really bad .
this is really not very good .
he took the camera .
he can make it look like i kidnapped him .
you did kidnap him , hanna .
well , now he can prove it .
&quot; 1465 elm street . 10 : 00 p.m. , bitches . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s swap .
my thumb drive for your camera . &quot;
thank you !
she &apos;s got two drinks . who is she meeting ?
looks like we &apos;re about to find out .
sydney ?
compliments of jenna marshall .
cheers .
still hard to say goodbye ?
it &apos;s just a house .
you don &apos;t mean that .
yeah , i do .
it &apos;s a house you built almost entirely by yourself .
i just wish i knew who bought it .
i guess we &apos;ll find out when they move in .
someone will send you a note , emily maybe or spencer .
you &apos;re about ready to head out ?
i made some sandwiches for the drive .
i &apos;ll grab a cooler .
okay .
马上出发 我只是想说
is the door locked ?
i doubt it .
who would wanna break in here ?
oh , my god , i hate rats .
i hate not knowing what this place is .
and why noel wants us here .
hey , you guys , there &apos;s something over here .
none of this feels right .
&quot; joseph lloyd king .
&quot; school for the blind .
established in 1873 . &quot;
i visited jenna in a blind school in philadelphia
but not this place .
the school operated here until 2009
and then it was relocated to bridge county .
so jenna could have come here
when she first lost her eyesight .
i didn &apos;t lose my sight .
you took it from me !
how did she get here ?
i thought caleb and mona
were tailing her .
i have the thumb drive .
give us the camera and we walk away .
and we &apos;ll pretend like none of this happened .
leave it on the table .
... chance to tell me the truth ? wake up , bitch .
what is that ?
it &apos;s me
trying to get answers from noel .
the camera &apos;s upstairs . let &apos;s go .
fine . we &apos;ll do it my way .
this is your chance to tell me the truth . fine.&apos;
we &apos;ll do it my way .
just admit it .
admit you &apos;re a.d.
was there a blind baby epidemic i didn &apos;t know about ?
this is where they learned how to take care of kids .
i need to . no .
just admit it .
admit you &apos;re ..
let &apos;s get out of here .
what is this place ?
i &apos;m not really sure .
i feel like i just walked into tim burton &apos;s garage sale .
well , i &apos;m not buying anything .
let &apos;s get out of here .
oh , no . i left my phone upstairs .
seriously ?
i don &apos;t wanna go back up there by myself .
come on .
just hurry up , okay ?
this place is a creep @-@ fest .
did you hear that ?
you really think we &apos;d let you leave ?
you know too much .
you can run ..
... but you can &apos;t hide .
what is taking them so long ?
oh , god , i really wanna get out here .
they brought us here to kill us .
grudge much , jenna ?
i &apos;m calling the police . text emily .
i don &apos;t have service .
me neither .
yeah , of course not !
there &apos;s gotta be another way up there . come on .
i taught jenna a lot ..
... but one thing she taught charlotte and me ..
... that was how to smell fear .
oh , my god !
alison ?
is that you ?
you &apos;ve been the bitch
the missing girl , the dead girl .
tonight , you get to be me .
now you see what i see .
you bitches never understood me .
i always get what i want .
oh , my god . oh , my god !
what is going on ?
oh , my god ! oh , my god , it &apos;s a head .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s a real head .
you &apos;re like scared little rats !
and you should be .
we gotta get out of here . jenna &apos;s got a gun .
no !
oh , god !
they locked us in ! they were never gonna let us out of here .
where &apos;s spencer ?
is that you , spencer ?
hiding in the corner ?
i smell your blood .
this is as much for me as it is for charlotte .
spencer !
spencer !
spencer !
spence ..
in here !
mary !
spencer .
oh , my god !
spence , wake up ! what did you do ?
what ?
please don &apos;t leave me .
spencer .
i would never hurt you .
i &apos;m your mother .
who are you ?
did you shoot spencer ?
you &apos;re a.d.
