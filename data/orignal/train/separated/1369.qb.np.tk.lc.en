maura .
that &apos;s your second cup of coffee .
third .
i was up late last night .
working or dating ?
working -- on a poem for my writing class .
mm . that sounds like fun .
well , it isn &apos;t .
i &apos;m really struggling with this assignment .
well , just keep it simple --
you know , &quot; there once was a man from nantucket . &quot;
why are you taking a poetry class ?
just trying to get my mind off the kidnapping
and focus on something positive .
and it &apos;s making you sick .
but don &apos;t worry . i have the perfect home remedy !
oh , no , ma , come on . not the orange garlic nonsense .
it &apos;s not nonsense if it works .
the last time she did this to frankie ,
his face blew up like the elephant man .
okay , that &apos;s true , but that &apos;s because i didn &apos;t know
you were supposed to remove the garlic from the orange peel .
yes , who would &apos;ve thought sticking garlic in your ear
would cause a stinky , nasty reaction ?
all right , put this in your ear ,
and i promise you your sinuses will be clear by lunchtime .
yeah , and i promise your hearing &apos;s gonna suck all morning .
ooh . god bless you .
ugh . thank you .
well , as long as it makes me feel better .
rizzoli .
dr. isles .
hello ?
hello ?
maura .
your ear .
you don &apos;t have to use my mother &apos;s crazy home remedies
just to be nice .
what is a lazy @-@ bone melody ?
never mind .
who &apos;s been eating an italian fruit smoothie ?
it &apos;s my mother &apos;s orange @-@ garlic &quot; sinus remedy . &quot;
she has a cure for everything .
what do we have ?
gunfight . one dead .
witnesses ?
sure .
nobody &apos;s talking .
you know the drill . it &apos;s an ethnic neighborhood .
nobody trusts the cops .
what is it , a drive @-@ by ?
more like gunfight at the o.k. corral .
we got 5 .45 casings .
they match the weapon found in the victim &apos;s hand .
yeah , a .22 here , so , okay ,
we got one on the sidewalk , one on the street .
this one wasn &apos;t much luckier .
oh , so our killer was hit , too .
i put out a bolo to all the hospital emergency rooms
to report anybody coming in with a gunshot wound .
okay . looks like he went this way .
you &apos;re right .
uh , the cashier at the corner store didn &apos;t see anything ,
but i checked the security camera ,
and it captures a young white guy
with a gun running over that way .
and the time matches .
we &apos;ll get that video to nina .
maybe she can pull a clear shot of the guy &apos;s face .
yeah .
let &apos;s get a photo of the victim over to the gang unit ,
see if he &apos;s got any connections to organized crime .
yep .
that &apos;s a big boy .
what &apos;s that ?
what can you tell us ?
oh , our victim seems to have been brought down
by a small @-@ caliber bullet .
had to be a perfect shot to drop such a big guy .
the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
do you have an official cause of death ? !
why are you yelling ? !
because you put fruit in your ears !
the orange peel is gone , and my sinuses are cleared .
congratulation-- really ? seriously ?
that craziness worked .
like a wonder drug .
all right .
so , our victim was killed
by a single .22 @-@ caliber gunshot wound to the heart .
shotspotter said that his .45 fired the first 2 shots .
so the victim was the aggressor .
it appears that the other guy was reacting in self @-@ defense ,
but , you know , who knows what happened
before they started shooting at each other
in the middle of the street ?
are you any close to i.d. &apos; ing him ?
no . we ran his prints through afis
and didn &apos;t get a hit .
and what about the victim &apos;s gun ?
stolen from a gun store in southie six months ago .
did you find anything that could tell us where he came from ?
well , i &apos;ve gone through his clothes ,
but there is nothing distinctive or unusual .
what about his boots ?
his boots -- we found dirt , oil ,
gum ,
bird droppings ,
and tomato sauce with sugar -- possibly pizza --
on the soles .
well , that &apos;s fantastic .
he could be from any neighborhood in boston .
i did remove a small piece of metal
with a plastic coating from the boot .
we &apos;ll run some tests and see if we can determine its origin .
all right .
well , anything you can find will help
&apos;cause , so far , all we have
are two john does shooting at each other .
hey . nina pulled a good image
of the shooter &apos;s face from the security video .
yeah ? uniforms showing it to the neighborhood ?
and they just found someone who thinks the shooter
lives in a nearby building with his mother .
with his mother ?
i know , right ?
just the thought gives you the willies .
what ? !
we &apos;re from bpd .
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
i &apos;m working here .
listen , we &apos;re not interested in your business .
yeah , &apos; cause my business is my business --
none of your business .
okay , uh , do you recognize him ?
no .
yeah , we don &apos;t know him .
um , look , i &apos;m doing massage here .
he needs to relax so i can make money , you understand ?
uh , people say that he &apos;s your son .
i don &apos;t have son , okay ? i &apos;ve answered your questions .
unless you want to pay for his massage ,
no more questions .
maybe we should discuss this down at the station ,
where there are fewer distractions .
and maybe you should talk to my ass !
i don &apos;t like having a door slammed in my face .
she is hiding something .
she was working .
on a naked man .
i tell you , if we could get a warrant ,
i &apos;d be back there right now .
i don &apos;t know . under different circumstances ,
i might like her .
maybe we should look at your judgment .
maybe you should talk to my ass .
okay , what do we got on our masseuse ?
her full name is katrin ulmanis .
she &apos;s 46 years old .
she came to the u.s. from latvia when she was 21,
got her citizenship , and then hit a rough patch .
what &apos;s her family background ?
there &apos;s no record of her ever being married
or having any children .
so the shooter is not her son .
no , she wasn &apos;t lying about that .
uh , but she had several arrests for prostitution
and petty theft ,
and in the late &apos; 90s , she did a short prison stint .
she been in any trouble lately ?
nope . her record &apos;s been clean for the last 15 years .
did vice ever investigate her massage business ?
she &apos;s a licensed massage therapist
with a five @-@ star rating on yelp .
&quot; katrin has just what you want --
firm hands and soft towels . &quot;
well , what more can you ask for ?
okay , what about our victim &apos;s photo ?
did the gang unit respond to it ?
uh , they &apos;ve never seen the guy .
i just sent over the image of our shooter .
maura &apos;s got something .
i noticed an unusual node on the victim &apos;s thyroid .
we tested it and found high levels
of radioactive iodine present .
okay .
an analysis revealed radioisotope i @-@ 29,
which is a by @-@ product of nuclear fission
and has no medical purpose like i @-@ 123,
i @-@ 124 , i @-@ 131 --
maura .
okay .
it is a kind of radioisotope
that was common after chernobyl .
i just checked with eurodep ,
which has nothing to do with johnny depp .
european radiological data exchange platform .
they monitor nuclear accidents .
there was a radiation spike in baldone , latvia , in 2014 .
now , although nothing was officially reported ,
scientists do believe that it was a nuclear @-@ reactor accident .
so it &apos;s possible that he was from baldone , latvia ?
yes .
yes .
great . okay .
i will get his fingerprints to korsak ,
who will send them to interpol , and then we will check ...
you okay ?
mm . yes , i &apos;m just a ... a little tired .
yeah , you do look exhausted .
maybe you should go home and rest .
i &apos;ve got too much to do .
kent .
didn &apos;t we talk about personal space
and professional behavior ?
yes , and i &apos;m just taking your temperature .
and you have a fever .
ibuprofen ?
allergic .
i really don &apos;t have time to be sick , anyway .
you know , i have so much work to do
and a writing assignment on top of it .
yeah , you do have a fever ,
but it doesn &apos;t have to hold you back for very long .
you know what the bedouins say .
it &apos;s a dry heat ?
n @-@ no . &quot; have a fever , light a fire . &quot;
what does that mean ?
now , how would you like to try something
that you &apos;ve never tried before ?
now , it &apos;s strictly professional ...
but very hot .
so , how are things with the gang unit ?
i think we got something you &apos;re gonna like .
oh , did you recognize our shooter ?
yeah , kid was hanging around with the quint street boys .
can you i.d. him ?
well , right now we just have a nickname for him here .
he goes by &quot; little nicky &quot; on the street .
yeah .
looks like he got involved with the gang earlier in the year .
then , a couple of months ago ,
he had a falling @-@ out with them , and he disappeared .
we figured he either fled or he was dead .
well , what was the falling @-@ out about ?
i don &apos;t know . could &apos;ve made a grab for power ,
insulted somebody &apos;s girlfriend ,
or took the last stick of gum .
yeah , usual crap .
all right , i &apos;m gonna need photos and background files
on all the gang leaders .
yeah , no problem .
great .
agris vilks , boss of the quint street boys .
nice scar .
oh , they &apos;re ruthless .
into the usual things --
drugs , prostitution , gambling .
but they &apos;ve done a good job laundering their money through legit businesses
like junkyards ,
construction , auto @-@ repair shops .
anything blue @-@ collar .
yeah . they like to fit in and fly under the radar .
interpol got a hit on the victim &apos;s fingerprints in latvia .
his name is egon kronis .
they believe he &apos;s a hit man for the latvian mob .
so nicky has a fallout with the gang ,
and they bring in a pro from latvia to take him out ?
they wanted the kid dead real bad .
and they wanted it done right .
when frankie told me about nicky ,
i dug a little deeper into katrin &apos;s background in latvia .
she had a sister there who passed away about a year ago ,
and she had a son named nicholas bartulis .
that &apos;s little nicky .
yep ,
and he entered the country on a tourist visa about a year ago .
so katrin didn &apos;t have her son living with her .
it was her nephew .
and if nicky &apos;s hurt and all of his friends are after him ,
there &apos;s only one place that he would turn for help .
good old aunt katrin .
no , we have uniforms all over that neighborhood .
no one &apos;s seen nicky .
okay , pull &apos; em off .
why ?
because we want nicky to think
it &apos;s finally safe to go back to katrin &apos;s place .
yeah , and i want to be there for that happy reunion .
i &apos;m gonna take a little walk ,
make sure none of our quint street pals
are waiting around for nicky .
last thing we need is another shootout in the streets .
okay .
hey .
is anyone letting you use their apartment to watch the alley ?
i &apos;ve had three nos , two doors slammed in my face ,
and a place with so many cats
it looked like an animal shelter on steroids .
well , at least there &apos;s no spiders .
really ? you had to mention spiders ?
i &apos;m not done yet .
uh , uh , detective rizzoli , boston p.d.
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i didn &apos;t say you did .
in fact , i bet you never do anything wrong .
real smooth .
that work for you with other women ?
no .
i don &apos;t know why i said that .
i &apos;m not that guy .
so who are you ?
just a cop that really needs some help .
streets are clear .
only one sitting on this building is us .
well , did you search all of boston ?
you &apos;ve been gone for an hour .
i had to find a restroom .
stakeouts are hard on old guys .
ohh , here we go .
no , i &apos;m not retiring .
no , but you &apos;re thinking about it .
well , you got to plan for the future .
i plan .
my plan is to stop your plan of retiring .
so , frankie , what &apos;s going on ?
what are you looking for ?
well , all i can really tell you is that i have to watch that alleyway .
listen , if there &apos;s anything you need to do ,
just ... pretend like i &apos;m not here .
why would i want to do that ?
well , i just don &apos;t want to get in your way .
you &apos;re not .
so , you can &apos;t talk about your case .
can you talk about yourself ?
okay , weirdest traffic stop ever .
oh . that &apos;s easy .
i was patrolling the university district
right after the bars closed .
me and my partner see this car .
it &apos;s driving real slow
and weaving in and out of its lane .
i need a plate check-- 13 november fred 68 .
thanks . okay .
carful of drunk fraternity kids--
that doesn &apos;t sound that bad .
yeah , well , that &apos;s what i thought .
so we pull the car over , and sure enough ,
it &apos;s filled with hammered frat boys .
but it &apos;s not a drunk @-@ driving stop ,
because the driver isn &apos;t drunk-- he &apos;s blind .
well , what did you do ? !
well , i yanked the one frat boy out
who could still put together a sentence ,
and he said , &quot; well , we knew we were too drunk to drive , officer ,
but we didn &apos;t really know how we were gonna
get back to the animal house . &quot;
then they spot this old blind guy at a bus stop .
they pay him to drive them back
while they direct him which way to go .
no .
they thought , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;ll get back safe ,
and we &apos;ll have a great story to tell . &quot;
what they didn &apos;t count on was that story would end in a jail cell .
how have i not heard this one ?
oh , i &apos;ve still got a few gems in the old trunk .
i &apos;m gonna miss this when it &apos;s over .
me too , kid . me too .
hi . how you doing ?
in a word-- feverish .
is this another one of my mother &apos;s crazy cures ?
no , it &apos;s kent &apos;s bedouin remedy .
oh , even better .
we &apos;ve identified the scrap of metal
that i found in the victim &apos;s boot ,
and it &apos;s definitely from a car part .
uh , we &apos;re working to i.d. a model .
okay , good .
if we can find nicky and get him to help us ,
then we &apos;re gonna need the physical evidence
to tie the hit man to the mob boss .
all right . we &apos;ll stay on it .
okay , thanks .
and ... good luck with the bedouins .
ugh . okay .
so , where are we with the piece of metal
that i pulled from the victim &apos;s boot ?
it &apos;s in the gas @-@ chromatography machine .
we should have the results back in about half an hour .
can you please get my notebook for me ?
and what kind of creative writing are we doing ?
ohh , this week &apos;s assignment is writing a poem
titled &quot; the opposite of me . &quot;
sounds interesting .
it might be if i understood what
the professor wanted .
but he &apos;s being purposefully vague .
well , maybe he &apos;s being vague
&apos;cause he wants you to think about the title creatively .
you see , that &apos;s the beautiful thing about poetry--
it &apos;s not contained by any traditional form or structure .
but i love structure .
yeah , then this is the perfect assignment for you .
it &apos;s gonna make you think outside the box .
maybe it would be easier if i felt better .
well , don &apos;t you worry .
i &apos;ll take care of everything in the lab .
all you have to do is lie back under the covers ,
open your pores , relax your mind ,
and let your imagination flow .
enjoy .
okay .
all right , what are you doing there ?
just sketching you .
really ? can i see it ?
no .
it &apos;s not done yet .
anyone ever tell you that you look like montgomery clift ?
no . who &apos;s montgomery clift ?
a movie star from the &apos; 50s .
i don &apos;t really watch old movies .
i love old movies .
and i love montgomery clift .
he was so handsome .
what do you like to do for fun ?
i love the red sox .
i don &apos;t know much about baseball .
you can &apos;t live in this town and not love the sox .
so tell me about them .
okay , the story begins december 26 , 1919 .
that &apos;s when the red sox traded babe ruth to the yankees .
maura said that she would move to maine
and write mystery novels .
you are avoiding the question .
i &apos;m asking where you see yourself .
i don &apos;t know .
probably right here doing the same thing ,
just with a different partner .
what about a family ?
i couldn &apos;t give up being a cop ,
and i never figured out how to have both , so ...
job takes a toll .
but i wouldn &apos;t change a thing .
i love being a cop .
find a job you love ,
you never work a day in your life .
and they pay us !
can you believe it ?
what &apos;d you get on that piece of metal ?
i think it &apos;s a scrap from the interior
of an automobile .
the plastic is consistent
with a wide variety of domestic vehicles .
well , that &apos;s not enough .
there was also a speck of road tar .
there had to have been more trace evidence .
well , why are you pushing me ?
because you want me to .
look , i @-@ i @-@ i ran it under an electron microscope .
i @-@ i bathed it in acid and rinsed it in saline .
what about the mass spectrometer ?
nothing !
it &apos;s a jagged piece of metal
that was violently ripped from a vehicle .
so , according to newton &apos;s third law of motion ,
there had to be something transferred to the scrap
that will reveal where it came from .
you sound like me .
i am you .
think , maura .
with that kind of impact ,
how can there be nothing left behind
on our little piece of metal ?
it was stuck to the bottom of a boot
and dragged all over the city .
whatever material was there
was rubbed clean simply by walking on it .
you know what i admire most about you ?
you never give up .
oh , my gosh .
what are those ?
my boots .
do we need to follow up with ...
why are you staring at me like that ?
your boots .
you &apos;re one to talk .
no !
the boots .
hey . how you feeling this morning ?
except for a crazy dream last night ,
i am back to my old self .
well , that &apos;s good news .
so , how you holding up out there ?
uh , okay , i guess .
i don &apos;t know . vince and i were talking about
him retiring one day , and it just got me thinking .
i don &apos;t know .
you think your life &apos;s never gonna change ,
and then one day it just does .
well , it &apos;s the nature of things .
yeah .
and then i realized that , one day ,
you &apos;re gonna tell me that you &apos;re gonna move
to some podunk town in maine and write novels .
well , i hope i get to tell you that one day .
well , i &apos;ll miss you .
no , you won &apos;t .
you won &apos;t have a chance because i &apos;m either taking you with me
or you &apos;re going to visit all the time .
okay , but can you make sure
you get a place with a basketball court ?
jane .
i got to go , maura .
hey . psst ! wake up .
look at this .
where &apos;s she going so early ?
well , hopefully , if we &apos;re lucky ,
she &apos;s gonna lead us to nicky .
okay . i want to keep eyes on her .
korsak . she &apos;s not in here .
shit !
ah . you look chipper .
yes .
i had a wild dream last night that was so vivid ,
but i woke up feeling refreshed .
ah , fever dreams and hallucinations
are common side effects .
well , this side effect may have helped the case .
i do hope that you &apos;re not still hallucinating ,
as you seem to be performing an autopsy on , well ... a boot .
can you hand me a swab ?
i already swabbed the sole ,
but didn &apos;t find anything unusual .
yes , but did you look inside the sole ?
no .
i &apos;m looking for trace particle transfer
from the piece of metal to the sole ,
something that was left behind in the plastic .
yeah .
a brown oily substance .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re the boss .
can you run an analysis ?
absolutely .
thank you .
i hope your fever dream was inspiration
for your writing as much as it was for your work .
well , let &apos;s just say
that i &apos;ve turned to the classics for inspiration .
the classics .
can &apos;t go wrong with the classics .
we &apos;ve got several patrol cars in the area . nobody &apos;s seen her .
the shop owner said that she walked in
and asked where the bathroom was .
korsak .
you got an address ?
nice work .
nina flagged katrin &apos;s accounts .
she just used an atm card at a bank three blocks away .
i &apos;ll check the atm .
yeah , i got the other side .
how can we have missed her ? she was just here .
yeah .
what ? when ?
all right , just -- just sit tight .
it was frankie .
he said he just saw katrin go into her apartment .
how &apos;d she get home so fast ?
she must have dumped the cash card
to nicky when we lost her .
but why here ?
there &apos;s a bank a block from her apartment .
maybe he couldn &apos;t get treatment without any cash .
you think he &apos;d take a hostage ?
you &apos;re in a tough spot , nicky .
we can prove that you shot and killed egon kronis .
no , but you don &apos;t understand .
we understand that you &apos;re involved
with the quint street boys .
we have your blood at the scene ,
and we have security video of you running away with a gun .
that &apos;s enough to put you away for life .
unless ... you &apos;d like to talk about the gang .
we know they wanted you dead .
we know they sent a hit man to do it .
what we don &apos;t know is why .
well , how can i trust you ?
how can you not ?
if you give us real info on the gang &apos;s criminal activity ,
we can see to it that you only do six months
for unlawful possession of a gun .
and we can put you into witness protection when you get out .
what about my aunt ?
her too .
i- i know who orders the murders .
and i know how they get rid of the bodies .
if you &apos;re willing to testify , we can make a deal .
i &apos;m nicky &apos;s lawyer .
i don &apos;t have one .
you do now . i was hired by your aunt katrin .
i &apos;ve got nothing else to say to you .
testimony like his can take down the quint street boys .
how do we get him to trust us once he &apos;s lawyered up ?
go to the one person he trusts .
i just got the preliminary results back
from the particles lifted from the sole of the boot .
anything interesting ?
well , there &apos;s a petroleum @-@ based substance --
possibly hydraulic or brake fluid .
well , i need to know specifically
what kind of lubricant it is and where it &apos;s used .
i &apos;ve already started running another analysis .
&quot; the opposite of me as far as i can tell
does stir the mind to search one &apos;s world
with passion and strength from the heart &apos;s purest well . &quot;
so ?
what do you think ?
well , mathematically , it &apos;s perfect .
i know .
a sonnet , three quatrains , alternating rhyme ,
and a couplet in iambic pentameter .
yes . yes , exactly .
and it &apos;s dreadful .
i know .
you &apos;re overthinking the whole thing , maura .
&quot; this little song , how can it be
that it can mean so much to me ?
what is it then revealing ?
it holds a breath of melody ,
a touch of gentle harmony ,
and the soul of tender feeling . &quot;
that &apos;s lovely .
and it &apos;s so simple .
exactly .
you see , great poets ,
they write simply and from the heart .
so you must take your view in the world
and let your heart write it , maura .
hey , vince .
can i ask you something ... personal ?
i guess so .
you and kiki seem very different .
we are .
did you ever have second thoughts about her because of that ?
not once .
well , i just met a girl ,
and she &apos;s very different from me .
different how ?
she &apos;s an artist ...
and a grad student .
loves old movies .
and she doesn &apos;t know anything about the sox .
anybody can learn about baseball .
do you like her ?
yeah , i do .
then what &apos;s wrong with different ?
different is interesting , exciting .
yeah ?
yeah .
you can &apos;t walk into my place .
i just did .
i have rights .
call the cops .
what do you want ?
your help .
i &apos;m pretty sure that nicky acted in self @-@ defense .
but if he does not cooperate with us , he &apos;s going to jail .
and if the gang wants him dead on the street ,
they will find someone who will kill him in prison .
this is all my fault .
why do you say that ?
&apos;cause i brought him here for better life .
look what happened .
i should &apos;ve known better .
you cannot make it here without connections ,
without education .
you did .
you made a life for yourself playing by the rules .
i know all about you , katrin .
i know about your past . i know about your sister .
i know that you brought nicky here to help him ,
and you can still do that .
you &apos;re just gonna have to trust us .
tell me about nicky and the gang .
he came here . he couldn &apos;t find a job .
so he sees all these men with cars , with money --
you know ? -- in the gang , and he want these things .
so he gets involved with people who promise to get him money .
so , why do they want to kill him ?
he does some stealing for the gang .
and he &apos;s good , you know ? he &apos;s loyal .
so they want him in the gang .
but he has to prove himself .
so they gave him a gun .
and they told him to kill a man
and where to dump the body .
and he couldn &apos;t do it .
he &apos;s not a killer .
he &apos;s not bad like that .
he &apos;s made a big mistake .
and there is only one way out of this .
he has to cooperate with us .
you gonna help him ?
yes .
i give you my word .
okay . i &apos;m gonna talk to him .
okay .
and then the next thing you got to do ,
you got to call off your lawyer .
what lawyer ?
when ?
all right .
lawyer convinced the judge
that since there were no witnesses
and we didn &apos;t find a murder weapon ,
nicky may have just gotten caught in the crossfire .
bail ?
100 grand .
we got to get down there before the gang does .
he &apos;s already made bail .
so they &apos;re gonna kill him .
like you said .
no . no , no , no .
we &apos;re not gonna let that happen , okay ?
okay ?
if nicky &apos;s still alive ,
it &apos;s only because the gang wants to know
what he told us before his lawyer got here .
only question is , how long can he hold out ?
and where they have him .
please tell me you &apos;ve got something .
i came up with all the businesses
and known addresses of the latvian crime boss .
and we have uniforms at all 13 locations ...
... but no sign of nicky .
hey , maura . you &apos;re on speaker .
the oily substance we found in the boot sole
is a type of high @-@ viscosity hydraulic fluid
with a phosphorous additive .
the additive is significant
because it &apos;s only used as a lubricant
in high @-@ pressure industrial machinery .
like what ? give me an example .
wind turbines , stone cutters , aircraft hydraulics .
