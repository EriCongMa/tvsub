i see you !
who was it ?
it was that perv , toby cavanaugh .
and i &apos;ll make sure everybody knows .
the cops took hanna to the police station today .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;d ever talk about ...
the jenna thing ?
we made a promise .
oh , my god . it &apos;s jenna .
whatever it is you &apos;re holding onto ,
it &apos;s got to stop .
i think he &apos;s dangerous .
and i think you need help .
you know what , melissa ...
spencer , we &apos;re pregnant .
i saw a photo on your website page
of you and jackie .
why did you break it off ?
i didn &apos;t . she did .
i feel like you &apos;re breaking up with me ,
but we were never really together .
i have a boyfriend .
and i think you deserve a better boyfriend .
you did this for money ?
jenna offered me cash to make myself available to you .
you were spying on me .
make sure she gets this .
toby &apos;s a friend .
you need to be careful about who you associate with .
i thought you were on our side .
being trailed is gonna help clear your name .
better it &apos;s me than someone who thinks you &apos;re guilty .
someone &apos;s been spying on us for years .
why did alison have these videos ?
this is why she was killed .
is that jenna ?
you &apos;re late .
who &apos;s she talking to ?
toby .
it &apos;s not right .
there &apos;s nothing wrong about us , toby .
we &apos;re not really related .
be so easy for me to convince your daddy and my mommy
that you &apos;ve been forcing yourself on me .
you have no idea who you &apos;re dealing with .
turn it off .
do you realize what these videos are ?
they &apos;re of us ... ali , jenna .
we &apos;re young girls in our bedrooms changing clothes .
we &apos;re naked !
exposed .
do you think someone was watching us
and getting it off on it ?
well , we all know who had a thing for younger girls .
i feel sick .
in some of these , we were just kids .
ian &apos;s been watching us for years .
and he killed alison to make sure nobody found out .
i wish ali would &apos;ve told us about these videos .
you guys , it is not too late to help her .
we can use this to prove that ian killed alison .
how are we gonna do that ?
we start by finding out what jenna knows .
are you on something ?
jenna &apos;s at the top of our a @-@ list .
look , i get it , okay , but she knows that these videos existed .
she was looking for them .
that &apos;s why she hired caleb to find that key !
spence , how are we ever supposed to believe
anything that bitch says ?
if that bitch is &quot; a , &quot; this could be a trap .
you guys , ian was watching all of us .
for all we know , he still is .
spencer &apos;s right . we have to try .
we &apos;ve been afraid of her since the jenna thing ,
and now we finally have something that she wants .
alison gave it to us .
so , i will cover this booster meeting ,
if you could pick mike up after practice .
sure , um , and if it &apos;s okay with you ,
he can stay at my place .
listen , thank you so much for coming over here .
it just makes it so much easier to do it in person .
yeah .
and thanks for the coffee .
you still make the best cup in town .
i &apos;m ... having the faculty mixer tonight .
uh @-@ huh . everybody would love to see you .
oh ... i don &apos;t know , byron .
come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
well , it &apos;s just--
what are we saying , &quot; welcome to our home ? &quot;
i mean , i don &apos;t exactly live here anymore .
it &apos;s just a party , ella .
dad ? hey , can i help ?
bet we make a great team .
absolutely . i &apos;ll take you up on that offer .
okay . bye .
bye .
so , you heard us ?
this is about so many different things .
i hope you know that .
there &apos;s just no simple fix .
look , dad cares too much to say this ,
but you either love him or you don &apos;t ,
so you should probably figure it out ,
because it sucks for all of us .
coffee &apos;s fresh .
no , thanks .
just came down to get supplies .
supplies ?
yeah . i &apos;m spending the rest of my life in bed .
oh . yeah . i tried that ...
after your father left ,
and you convinced me i was pretty and smart
and isabel was fat and ugly ?
yeah , well , i lied about the last part .
well , i knew that , but i got out of bed .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re hurting , hanna ,
but you &apos;re gonna go take a shower ,
put on a beautiful dress ,
and know that i &apos;m making you go to school because i love you .
here .
what did the letter say ?
what letter ?
caleb brought you a letter .
after he left here yesterday ,
he was on his way to give it to you .
well , i guess he decided not to .
he seemed pretty determined to find you .
oh , he found me , looked at me ,
and then got on the bus to bastardville .
he won &apos;t be alone there .
mm . hey , babe .
you , uh , sure you don &apos;t want me to give you a ride to the church ?
don &apos;t be silly .
i can walk from the station , daddy .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you later .
bye .
church ?
we &apos;re planning the christening .
isn &apos;t that a little premature ,
you know , if it &apos;s not born a human .
that &apos;s not funny .
well , humor &apos;s subjective .
no , i know how you feel about ian ,
but i honestly thought you &apos;d be happy about this baby .
that was cruel .
i &apos;m sorry .
well ... it doesn &apos;t help to tell me that .
i need to talk to you about something .
is dad okay ?
mom .
yes , honey , he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s fine .
they extended your dad &apos;s assignment ,
and he wants us to come to texas .
you-- you mean for a visit ?
for a year .
look , honey , we &apos;ve been separated too long .
it &apos;s not good for us .
mom , i @-@ i get it , but ...
you know , maybe this is what we need ,
you know , a fresh start .
i don &apos;t need a fresh start .
i felt like an outsider for so long .
i &apos;m just starting to feel like i belong here .
you &apos;re 16 , emily .
you belong with your family .
i &apos;ve been calling you all morning . where are you ?
i was talking to the principal .
what happened ?
i ...
i just gave my resignation .
ezra ...
hollis offered me the job .
you scared the hell out of me !
that hurt .
i don &apos;t care !
the cops , the ten messages you sent me doesn &apos;t ring a bell ?
i &apos;m sorry . i panicked last night
because the guy was standing in my doorway
asking questions about a student .
we &apos;re fine . wasn &apos;t about you .
it was about spencer and the trophy and ...
props , and i ...
aria , i &apos;m not gonna be your teacher anymore .
we can grab a cup of coffee , go to a reading .
we can live outside my apartment .
i &apos;m sorry i punched you .
professor fitz !
so , i &apos;ll be attending the faculty mixer at your house tonight .
right , i &apos;ll give you the tour .
i &apos;ll show you my room .
ahem ! okay then .
i know it hurts , hanna .
he was your first poor boy ,
and that &apos;s oh @-@ so @-@ romantic ,
but you deserve better .
caleb told my mom he wrote me a letter .
he didn &apos;t leave anything for me , did he ?
well , let &apos;s pretend he did .
it wouldn &apos;t change anything .
i mean , he was a jerk !
you wanted him to go away , right ?
you know , i think i &apos;m more mad at myself than him .
for what ?
for being stupid .
i actually believed he loved me .
sorry .
you &apos;re not gonna be mad at me forever , are you ?
probably .
who &apos;s there ?
it &apos;s spencer .
who else ?
aria , emily ...
and hanna .
should i call security ?
we have what you hired caleb to find .
you didn &apos;t think it was wrong , but toby did .
so , you &apos;ve seen it ?
every frame .
what do you want from me ?
the truth .
can you handle that ?
look , when i said alison came to visit me at the hospital ,
i was telling you the truth .
she didn &apos;t come to talk about you , spencer .
that was a lie .
and how do we know that you &apos;re not lying to us now ?
you knew alison , okay ? you knew what she was capable of .
we &apos;re listening .
it was the day before she went missing ,
and she was on her way home from georgia .
she had just found the video ...
she couldn &apos;t wait to play it for me .
it &apos;ll be so easy for me to convince your daddy and my mommy
that you &apos;ve been forcing yourself on me .
where did you get that ?
the guy i like likes to make movies .
i thought they were just of me .
you think you know people ...
and then they surprise you .
turns out , the boy next door
gets off on watching all the girls next door .
and darling jenna isn &apos;t the victim .
freak toby is .
i &apos;m not proud of that .
i so don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m gonna keep this under lock and key .
and if you keep our secret , it &apos;ll stay there .
fine .
i thought you &apos;d see it my way .
oh , and jenna ...
if you ever come back to rosewood ,
i &apos;ll bury you .
she was on her way home from georgia ?
th @-@ that &apos;s what she said .
and then she made some joke
about her ... tan .
too bad i couldn &apos;t see it .
did she tell you anything else ?
it was a short visit .
look , i @-@ i have given you what you &apos;ve asked for .
what are you gonna give me ?
we &apos;ll make sure the video stays in a safe place .
okay .
we &apos;ve all made mistakes .
remember , i &apos;m still paying for years .
sick .
for all we know , she wrote that story .
and we still don &apos;t know how ali got the video .
yes , we do . that video was alison &apos;s insurance policy ,
and she cashed it in the day that she got it .
which means she was with ian when she found it .
and she couldn &apos;t wait to play that video for jenna .
god , do you remember how happy ali was
when she came back from that trip ?
i think it &apos;s because , for her , the jenna thing was over .
nice of her to share the safety net with us .
&quot; wait for it , girls . wait for it . &quot;
wait for what ?
that &apos;s what ali said when we met her at the taxi .
maybe that &apos;s what we were waiting for .
do you remember at alison &apos;s funeral ,
when we were all wondering why jenna was there ?
if she &apos;s telling the truth ,
jenna came back because she could .
and ali &apos;s the one who got buried .
well , if you want , my dad can call your mom
and officially offer you the guestroom .
this is so not fair .
i mean , we lost each other for a year .
i can &apos;t imagine not being ...
i got it .
okay , you &apos;re sure ian can &apos;t trace this number back to us ?
it &apos;s a prepaid phone , i used cash ,
and the number isn &apos;t registered , so ...
service is anonymous .
how do you know this stuff ?
don &apos;t you ever watch cnn ?
not any chance of that .
homeland security is trying to ban these things .
he acts like he doesn &apos;t have a care in the world .
he thinks he got away with it .
well , he hasn &apos;t .
okay , so we convince ian
that this isn &apos;t about anything but money .
hopefully that &apos;ll throw him off of us .
if he wants his home movies , it &apos;s just gonna cost him .
and then when he shows up for the swap , we ...
make our own movie .
right , and we take that , the flash drive ,
and the prepaid phone into the police .
the second he responds with a text , we know that he &apos;s guilty .
send it already .
there must &apos;ve been a part of me that didn &apos;t believe it ,
because i just ... i @-@ i feel ...
numb ?
somehow i @-@ i thought i &apos;d feel better
when we found out for sure .
well , i know what they do to guys like him in prison ,
and that makes me feel a lot better .
it &apos;s just my mom making sure i stayed out of bed .
he wants to know what we want .
is this the &quot; let &apos;s love on hanna &quot; lunch committee ?
feeling better , sweetie ?
i &apos;m sorry , i have this thing that i have to do .
and then there were four .
i &apos;ll help .
yeah , me too .
and then there were two .
um , i &apos;m really sorry , mona ,
but spencer has this thing ,
and she really needs her friends right now .
and then there was mona .
hanna !
caleb , i &apos;m glad you called .
yeah , i gave her your letter , and she threw it in the trash .
do yourself a favor , caleb , lose her number ,
because she &apos;s already lost yours .
yeah , bye @-@ bye birdie . sayonara , sam .
hello ?
what &apos;s that look about , hermie ?
having your period ?
hanna never got that letter , did she ?
she thinks he left without saying good @-@ bye .
you know , you act like such a terrible person ,
but i always thought some of it was just an act .
i guess i was wrong .
i didn &apos;t give her the letter because caleb really hurt her .
you think we should let him do that to her again ?
i see no combination of &quot; you &quot; and &quot; i &quot; that forms &quot; we . &quot;
i know i &apos;ve made a lot of jokes at your expense ,
but i was just having fun .
is that your version of an apology ?
i am sorry .
and if you forget about the stupid letter ,
i &apos;ll make it up to you .
i &apos;ll help you transform from her @-@ mie to her man .
she &apos;s not into me like that .
not yet .
this is your chance , lucas .
are you gonna man up or not ?
they found the video .
and they &apos;ve seen it .
you don &apos;t need to worry .
i &apos;m taking care of it ,
and i &apos;ll be there soon .
hey . emily .
um , can we-- can we talk for a second ?
are you watching me now , too ?
no , not at all .
it &apos;s forced family fun night with the reynolds .
dancing with the stars is on and they vote ,
so they &apos;re all really ... invested .
when i realized you were a cop ,
i thought we had someone on our side .
well , it might not look like it ,
but i am on your side .
i don &apos;t enjoy following spencer ,
but if she hasn &apos;t done anything wrong ...
if ?
i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
off the record ,
i know she wouldn &apos;t have done anything to hurt alison .
here &apos;s my cell number . call me if you need anything .
thanks , garrett .
i &apos;m glad i ran into you .
me too .
hey , uh , if you want to join in on the fun ,
there &apos;s an extra laz @-@ e @-@ boy .
thanks , but i should ... really get ...
that &apos;s cool . i get it . heh .
hanna ?
i don &apos;t want to be alone .
i ran into lucas in the parking lot ,
and he asked me to give you this .
i think you left it in the cafeteria .
how did things get so screwed up ?
now your mom &apos;s back there packing boxes .
maybe we could pack her up .
mm . i thought things were better between you guys .
they are .
texas ...
it &apos;s beauty queen capital of america .
well , that could be a good thing ...
if that &apos;s your type .
it &apos;s not .
so , you have a type ?
okay , just promise me
that you all won &apos;t come back with big hair .
i promise .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t want to be alone , either .
are you sure this is how you want to spend the afternoon ?
i like having you here .
because it makes a statement to your family ?
no . because i like having you here .
i like being here .
do you want to talk about tonight ,
about what might happen ?
i think i &apos;m ... kind of all talked out , you know ?
come here .
come over here .
what ?
alison &apos;s so cunning .
she &apos;s still taunting us from the grave .
if this video gets out , we will lose everything .
i won &apos;t let that happen .
promise me ?
i promise you .
hi , i &apos;m jackie molina .
is this the montgomery house ?
what are you doing here ?
i teach at hollis .
this is the faculty mixer , right ?
excuse me .
-melissa
oh , it &apos;s from melissa .
ian never showed up at the church . she wants a ride .
i &apos;ll keep jenna busy like you asked me to ,
but i wish i was going with you tonight .
hey , you &apos;re helping me by
finding out if she &apos;s a part of this or not .
look , i &apos;ve never had a safe place to land ...
but now i feel like i do , so ...
i want you to stay safe .
if you need anything tonight ...
i &apos;ll be there for you .
i love knowing that .
what were you thinking ?
what , it didn &apos;t occur to you that she &apos;d be here tonight ?
no , it didn &apos;t , aria .
i haven &apos;t seen her since last summer ,
and she was a t.a. then .
i can &apos;t help but think that you still have feelings for her .
there &apos;s no other reason for you to keep that from me .
she is not a part of my life anymore .
yes , she is !
she &apos;s downstairs having wine with my dad .
i screwed up .
not telling me about her was a lie .
i &apos;m sorry .
until today ...
you were the one guy who had never lied to me .
so , why are you doing this ?
because hanna deserves to be happy .
i talked to him this afternoon .
he was taking care of the contractor ,
then heading straight for the church .
something &apos;s wrong , i can feel it .
calm down , okay ?
ah , i can &apos;t find my phone .
do you want me to call your number ?
damn it ! i left it at the church .
melissa , you have to relax .
please , this cannot be good for the baby .
spoken like a sister who actually cares .
i @-@ i care , okay ?
i wish i could believe you .
do you want me to go back to the church ?
yes .
spence , it &apos;s us again .
it &apos;s 7 : 30 and we &apos;re at the park . where are you ?
maybe she &apos;s on her way and she just doesn &apos;t have a signal .
i don &apos;t know .
if she &apos;s not here in ten minutes , we &apos;re calling the cops .
oh , spencer .
she &apos;s stable , but they &apos;re monitoring the baby .
monitoring for what ?
they say it &apos;s too early to tell
how significant the trauma was .
and are you okay ?
the car came out of nowhere .
oh , honey , it wasn &apos;t your fault .
what ?
it &apos;s not spencer .
it &apos;s from &quot; a. &quot; it &apos;s for all of us .
事情远非表面上那么简单 -a
does &quot; a &quot; know we &apos;re here ?
&quot; a &quot; knows everything .
we have to find ian . i &apos;ve left him three messages .
she &apos;s not gonna relax until we find him .
maybe he went to the church .
she left her phone there , anyway .
it &apos;s just a couple of blocks . i &apos;ll go look .
spencer , about what i said this morning .
melissa knows that you love her .
spencer hastings ?
yeah ?
we recovered this from your vehicle .
thank you .
he &apos;s here .
spencer , where are you ?
no ! stay with melissa .
we &apos;re safe .
okay . bye .
thanks for coming .
trust me . i &apos;m glad you called .
okay . so , no one else knows you &apos;re here but me , right ?
well , i left a note for my mom
in case anything happened to us .
all right , well , this looks like the only way in ,
so if ian shows , i &apos;ll see him coming .
hello ?
he &apos;s got a gun .
he does ?
guys , he &apos;s a cop .
did you really leave a note for your mom ?
yeah . &quot; dear mommy ,
i went to the woods to trap a killer . &quot;
hello ? reverend ackard ?
someone &apos;s coming .
i want the three of you to stay out of sight .
stop right there .
put your hands where i can see them and turn around .
it &apos;s not ian .
lose something ?
look , someone paid me to drop off this bag
and pick up a package .
he found me online . my name is logan reed .
i &apos;m telling you the truth .
spence , um , ian didn &apos;t show .
he sent a messenger .
we &apos;re on our way to the hospital , okay ?
melissa left her phone here .
we &apos;ve been trying to call you .
you know , i got the strangest text message today .
the number was blocked , but i could reply to it .
yeah , asking for money .
that was clever .
are your friends waiting for me ?
look , there &apos;s been an accident .
yeah , i know . i got the messages .
i &apos;ve just been waiting for you to leave the hospital .
you know , melissa
would want me to take care of this .
she &apos;ll understand .
you gonna take care of me like you took care of alison ?
well , is that why you killed her ?
&apos;cause she found your home movies ?
do you want some popcorn to go with that ?
no . come on , come on .
spence ?
i can &apos;t give you the videos more than once !
spencer ?
my mom knows i &apos;m here . she knows i &apos;m in the church .
picked a perfect place for your suicide .
it &apos;s ian .
call 911 .
oh , you didn &apos;t mean to hurt alison , huh ?
it was an accident .
you pushed her , and she fell .
is that what happened ?
she just hit her head and she never woke up .
alison died of suffocation .
yeah , the letter that i wrote on your computer
won &apos;t answer all the questions , but it will answer enough .
the guilt was just too much for you .
aah ! no ! no !
please .
if you love my sister , you won &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m doing it because i love her .
let go of me !
please don &apos;t ! no ! please !
what are you doing here ?
aah !
spencer !
spencer !
spence !
oh , my god .
guys .
spencer ! spencer !
spence !
spencer ! spence !
where is she ? spencer !
spencer !
are you okay ?
oh , my god .
hey , look , you did what you had to do , okay ?
no , i didn &apos;t . someone else did .
no , spence , there was nobody else here .
maybe he fell .
all i saw was a black hoodie .
&quot; a &quot; ?
ian killed alison , and he tries to kill me .
no , hey , spence .
hey . he &apos;s dead , okay ?
it &apos;s over . it &apos;s over . okay ?
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
stop right there .
is this some kind of a joke ?
what do you mean ?
there &apos;s nobody in there .
come with me .
ella !
i got a text from aria .
i heard ian thomas is dead .
she &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m so sorry , byron .
no , it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re okay .
those girls knew alison .
are they lying ?
why would they lie ?
oh , my god .
does this mean ... ?
&quot; it &apos;s not over until i say it is . &quot;
&quot; sleep tight ... &quot;
... &quot; while you still can , bitches .
&apos;a &apos; &quot;
