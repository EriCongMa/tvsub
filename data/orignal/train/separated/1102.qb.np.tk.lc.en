i &apos;ve been tracking down my missing rv .
toby gave it to &quot; a , &quot; but spencer already knew that .
i &apos;m sorry .
toby just isn &apos;t ready to let you guys know what &apos;s going on yet .
i found this . red coat is &quot; a , &quot; right ?
we &apos;re looking for a blond .
it &apos;s not this .
e · 兰博
e. lamb ? eddie lamb ?
that &apos;s me .
e · 兰博
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m not interested .
how many points for the word &quot; slut &quot; ?
stop ! that &apos;s my car ! what are you doing ? !
i kinda wish i had done it .
if anything like this happens to you again ,
i wanna be ready .
it &apos;s the gun . at least i think it is .
why do you have that ?
because i found it in my mom &apos;s closet . i have to get rid of it .
hold it ! don &apos;t move !
that gun was used to kill detective wilden ,
and your mother &apos;s fingerprints are on the bullets .
i &apos;ve got a key to sign in .
come on , guys . let &apos;s go .
&apos;cause we &apos;re breaking in to wilden &apos;s apartment .
look for letters , pictures--
anything that might connect wilden to shana and jenna .
if she doesn &apos;t find that key , we &apos;re gonna have a problem .
we can &apos;t afford for me not to be working .
could you just put bob larabee on the phone ?
he took the initial report .
thanks . i &apos;ll wait .
bob ? no , no , no , we &apos;re -- we &apos;re in the motel .
i have to meet the insurance adjustor over there about 2 : 00,
but look , before we do --
yes , i understand it was a stolen car ,
but no sign of the driver ?
i mean , if he was strung @-@ out
enough to drive straight into my living room ,
then how did he get away so fast ?
no , no .
look , i know you &apos;re doing everything you can ,
but this car crashed into my house .
my daughter could &apos;ve been sitting in that room .
look , i &apos;m just gonna call you back
after i meet with the adjustor , okay ?
all right , thanks . bye .
how does someone just run away from an accident like that
without one neighbor seeing him ?
you better bring a jacket .
it &apos;s supposed to get cold tonight .
i &apos;ll come straight home after school to help you unpack .
don &apos;t you have a college guidance session today ?
yeah , it was scheduled for this morning , but i figured ...
honey , don &apos;t miss that , please .
mom , i wanna help you out .
you can help me by thinking about your future .
还行 你妈妈呢
how are they ?
she said they &apos;re fine .
&quot; a &quot; really likes throwing cars at people .
is there any chance this really was an accident ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought .
no , okay , &quot; a &quot; did this , but why ?
to keep us off balance , keep us from finding red coat ,
or cece drake , or whoever we &apos;re dealing with .
well , i think it really was cece ,
and i hope that toby and caleb find her .
god , spence , what is taking your mom so long ?
courts run on judge @-@ time , not lawyer @-@ time .
well , it &apos;s an arraignment .
all they have to do is set bail and she can go .
she said that she would call you
the minute that your mom was released .
just take a breath , all right ?
mom ?
hi . have you girls had breakfast ?
mrs. hastings , where &apos;s my mom ?
spencer , why don &apos;t you take aria upstairs for a minute ?
no .
no , i want them here .
hanna , we entered a plea of not guilty ,
but the judge refused to grant bail .
no .
why ?
first degree murder of a police officer ,
a district attorney who doesn &apos;t want to make any more mistakes .
but we &apos;re definitely going to appeal .
okay , and how long is that gonna take ?
the papers will be on the judge &apos;s desk this afternoon .
but some things have been put in motion .
what sort of things ?
hanna , your mother is going to be transferred to another location .
what location ?
she &apos;s being remanded to the state prison in muncy
until the trial .
they &apos;ll move her tomorrow .
god , you promised .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
i should be the one in jail , not my mom .
hanna , you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
yeah , somebody killed wilden
and &quot; a &quot; is taking advantage of that .
it &apos;s not your fault .
my mom went out there to protect me ,
how is this not my fault ?
it &apos;s caleb . i can &apos;t talk to him right now .
hanna , my mom is a really great lawyer .
well , then why isn &apos;t my mom out ?
because it &apos;s just one hearing .
she &apos;ll win the case . she always does .
always ?
okay , so do you wanna go to school ? or not go ?
no , you guys go . i &apos;ll be okay .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m gonna have to see my dad .
if my mom doesn &apos;t come back ,
then i have to move in with him and the gruesome twosome .
you guys go . i &apos;ll be fine .
okay .
spence , tell your mom i &apos;m sorry
if i yelled at her .
she &apos;s an attorney , okay ? she &apos;s used to it .
a really good one .
okay , well , call us if you need anything , all right ?
yeah . i &apos;ll be good .
hey , aria .
sorry .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
hey , so i &apos;m gonna be out late tonight with the team .
i &apos;m checking in with you
in case dad calls from syracuse .
but please don &apos;t say i have a curfew .
what &apos;s going on with the team ?
we &apos;re celebrating after the game .
how do you know that you &apos;re gonna be celebrating ?
well , if we win , it &apos;s a celebration .
if we lose , it &apos;s a party .
so , what time do you think -- - just don &apos;t wait up .
mike , what time are you -- - it &apos;s important .
i need to spend time with these guys .
why ?
it &apos;s different ...
since the thing with connor &apos;s car .
well , what &apos;s that have to do --
i &apos;m handling it .
where did you get that bag ?
i &apos;m taking a class there .
in martial arts ? why ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with learning how to defend yourself .
so is it an elephant ?
a dinosaur ?
oh , come on , malcolm , you need to give me a hint .
oh , okay , is it supposed to be me ?
uh , well , hey , listen , rembrandt .
we &apos;re gonna talk about this later . i &apos;m with a student now .
but , okay . love you . bye .
hey , come in .
i didn &apos;t even think you were gonna be here .
yeah , me neither .
but my mom wants me to focus on the future ,
with or without a house .
oh , my god , emily , i &apos;m so sorry .
i can &apos;t even imagine what the two of you must be ...
feeling .
do the police have any idea ?
they &apos;re still investigating .
they know it was a stolen car .
we don &apos;t have to do this now .
with the accident and
everything that &apos;s going on with hanna &apos;s mom --
if i don &apos;t , then i &apos;ll start missing deadlines .
just start thinking that things are gonna get better , right ?
right .
emily , when i first got here , you and your friends
were dodging some pretty serious threats .
and i know that mona confessed to a lot of that ,
but is there anybody else who still wants to hurt you ?
is history repeating itself ?
you guys took a long time to speak up ,
and if this is happening again --
it was an accident .
some speed freak lost control
and used my front porch as a bumper .
where is this college ?
maryland .
she isn &apos;t answering my calls .
she &apos;s really ragged right now .
she thought her mom was gonna get bail . we all did .
i just don &apos;t like her being alone , you know ?
well , she said that she &apos;s gonna call her dad .
come on . that &apos;s not any better than being alone , if you ask me .
look , i &apos;m gonna cut after english
and make sure she &apos;s not at home still hiding under my sheets . okay ?
how are the rest of you doing ?
we &apos;re just dandy .
spencer ...
i drove by emily &apos;s , okay ?
they &apos;re still pulling pieces of that car out of the living room .
so , i &apos;m gonna ask you again : how are you doing ?
we &apos;re trying to stay positive .
if &quot; a &quot; is escalating things ,
maybe it means that we &apos;re getting too close for comfort .
maybe you and toby are getting too close to wilden &apos;s killer .
anyway , that number that you pulled from nigel &apos;s cell phone ,
did you ever figure out who was on the other end ?
somebody really smart .
the number is assigned to three people and three addresses .
all in new york .
well , which one is real ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s why toby went to new york --
to knock on some doors , see who answers .
maybe cece drake .
maybe .
okay , will you please just have hanna call me ?
i will .
thank you .
this college is tiny .
is it worth even filling out an application ?
why not ?
well , if there &apos;s hardly any slots --
well , let &apos;s not write our own rejection letter quite yet .
you probably have a better shot than most people .
mr. fitz , i don &apos;t swim anymore .
no , i &apos;m talking about your work outside of the pool .
these little colleges are looking to build communities .
and they &apos;d probably be pretty excited
about the work you did last summer in haiti .
that was for , like , three weeks .
yeah , three weeks you spent volunteering ,
thinking about others and not yourself .
that &apos;s ... pretty impressive .
i don &apos;t feel very impressive .
are you still in touch with any of your old supervisors ?
i only had one . zoe .
call her .
ask her to write you a reference .
somebody &apos;s gotta remind you who you really are , emily .
hello ?
hello . you have a collect call
from an inmate in a correctional facility .
ashley marin .
if you wish to accept and pay for the call ,
please press three now .
hanna .
mom . are you okay ?
so far .
veronica told you about the bail
and how they &apos;re gonna move me ?
yeah . yeah , she told me .
i don &apos;t want you to worry about this , sweetheart .
we are going to get through this .
i miss you .
i miss you .
we are going to be all right .
god , it &apos;s not fair .
they can &apos;t take you away like this .
right now it &apos;s not fair , but things can change .
yeah . yeah , they can .
veronica &apos;s gonna bring you here tomorrow
so we can say ...
so i can see you , okay ?
okay .
i love you , mom .
i love you .
i should let you go .
okay .
bye .
thanks for coming .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m gonna confess to killing detective wilden .
you &apos;re gonna help me .
whatever they do to me will be as bad as what they do to her
that &apos;s probably true .
you &apos;re taking an awful big chance .
i can &apos;t let my mom go to prison
i mean talking to me .
suppose i &apos;m the one who actually set up your mother .
were you serious when you said
you never wanted this &quot; a &quot; to hurt my mom ?
yes , i was .
well , then you have to help me do this .
why me ?
because this is going to be the biggest lie i &apos;ve ever told .
i need you to make it sound perfect .
me , spencer , the others ,
we all tell lies ,
but you &apos;re the only one who actually knows how to live in a lie .
hanna ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m beckett .
sam or saint thomas ?
圣托马斯 · 贝克特 坎特伯雷大主教
beckett frye . you must be spencer , right ?
yeah . what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m interning with your mother .
goldberg penn law school alumni fellow .
right , that &apos;s why you &apos;d be at her office ,
why are you in our kitchen ?
blame the district attorney .
discovery in the marin case .
they send you everything and make you wade through it .
d.a. got cute and sent to your mother &apos;s home address
instead of her office .
somebody &apos;s in a jail cell . they make it like it &apos;s a game .
it is a game .
that &apos;s why they use the words &quot; winning &quot; and &quot; losing . &quot;
you &apos;re gonna make a great lawyer .
thanks .
do you have many more of these ?
plenty .
let me give you a hand .
what do you think you &apos;re doing here ?
i &apos;m the one who killed detective wilden . i did it .
go home , little girl . you &apos;re just trying to save your mother .
no , she &apos;s just trying to take the blame . i did it .
you can &apos;t just keep repeating , &quot; i did it . &quot;
you have to tell them
how you did it and why you did it .
okay , i know that .
everything that seems to point to your mom ,
make it point to you , okay ?
motive . what &apos;s your motive ?
he was threatening me because i told people
he got alison dilaurentis pregnant .
i think he might have killed her .
that &apos;s good . that &apos;s really good .
i think they sent us wilden &apos;s grammar school report cards .
no , i checked the box numbers before i signed for them .
no , your daughter &apos;s here .
your mother wants to know why you &apos;re not at school .
i &apos;m checking on hanna .
you hear that ?
no , she &apos;s the only one here .
no , don &apos;t worry about it .
yeah , yeah , take your time .
i &apos;m gonna be fine . i promise you .
hey , jake .
hi . thank you so much .
i &apos;m not taking you away from a class , am i ?
i &apos;m good .
so i think that my little brother is taking a class from you .
mike ...
montgomery . yeah , great kid .
yeah , i &apos;m actually really worried about him .
has he said something to you ?
something that someone like me should know about ?
i know that i shouldn &apos;t even ask that .
since you are , it must be important .
yeah , thank you .
he did say something odd .
what ?
he said , &quot; it &apos;s hard to focus on the game
when your own teammates are playing against you . &quot;
what does that mean ?
i &apos;m guessing some of his teammates think he &apos;s an easy target .
what is it with your family ? first you , now your brother .
you didn &apos;t tell him that i said that i was scared , did you ?
no , i didn &apos;t , but --
i don &apos;t want you to . it &apos;s --
i won &apos;t .
okay .
it &apos;s important . he doesn &apos;t need to worry about me .
aria , i know we had the conversation
about you not being ... available .
but if you &apos;re scared and you need help ,
i &apos;m here for you ...
without any complications .
okay ?
hello .
hello .
i thought it was time i thanked everybody who looked after me .
you &apos;re welcome .
i brought you something .
达伦 · 威尔登 w @-@ 46809
have a cookie .
the night toby &apos;s mom died you were questioned by police .
by detective wilden , only he was officer wilden then .
i wasn &apos;t questioned , i was interviewed .
come on , eddie .
they talked to everyone who was working that night .
and what did you say ?
you &apos;ve read it .
&quot; subject reported patient cavanaugh
&quot; was not in her room at bed check .
&quot; he discovered the roof access door unlocked .
&quot; he went up to the roof and looked over the east ledge
and saw a body on the ground below . &quot;
that &apos;s what wilden wrote in his notes .
yeah , that &apos;s what i told him .
then why in the official report
does it say that she jumped from a window and not the roof ?
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , the woman &apos;s dead .
if it doesn &apos;t make any difference ,
then why would wilden change the facts when he filed the report ?
why would he lie ?
why does anybody lie ?
you think somebody paid him off
to lie about how toby &apos;s mom died ?
didn &apos;t you ever wonder how a guy like wilden
goes from being patrolman to detective so fast ?
you should have told somebody when they filed the report .
tell who ? the police ? wilden was the police .
well , toby deserves some answers ... and so do i.
spencer , if i were you , i would put this back
where i found it and forget that i ever saw it .
it &apos;s not going to change anything ,
not for you , not for me , and not for toby &apos;s mother .
yeah , well , my friend hanna &apos;s mother
is sitting in jail accused of killing wilden ,
so i need to know who else wanted to see him dead .
the police took all the high heels in my house .
my mother &apos;s , mine .
and left you with nothing but flats ?
that &apos;s barbaric .
you said there was a woman &apos;s shoeprint where wilden was killed .
are they going to find a match
with something from your mom &apos;s closet ?
i don &apos;t think so .
why not ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s a pair missing .
manolos . they had mud on them .
they were hidden under the sink , and then they were gone .
you threw them out .
no , they just weren &apos;t there anymore .
no , hanna , you threw them out .
they &apos;re the shoes you were wearing
when you met wilden at the lake and shot him .
i did ?
you tried to clean them and when you couldn &apos;t ,
you threw them away .
you wore those shoes that night , not your mother .
you threw them out .
i threw them out because they were my mom &apos;s
and i didn &apos;t want anyone to think that those were her prints .
you see ? it all makes sense now , doesn &apos;t it ?
now let &apos;s talk about the gun .
有汉娜的消息吗
you didn &apos;t tell me you came from perfect town , u.s.a.
zoe , great to see you .
hey . this town is almost as photogenic as you .
almost .
was this really on your way ?
it was close enough .
i figured when i got your email , it was worth the detour .
so where you been , joe dimaggio ?
you don &apos;t call , you haven &apos;t answered any emails ,
nobody &apos;s heard from you in months .
i know , i &apos;m sorry .
i really did wanna stay in touch , it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s been a little , um ...
i &apos;ve been busy .
keeping busy is good .
i was just worried that you were still dealing with losing maya .
still miss her .
you don &apos;t have to tell me .
i saw your face when you got off the plane .
i thought it would take an entire summer to rebuild you .
was i any help at all that summer ?
or was i just another disaster area ?
excuse me ?
by the third day , you were m.v.p. of the entire team .
we had to pry the electric drill out of your hands .
i &apos;m putting a crew together this summer ,
and i wish i had an emily on every single team .
where are you guys going this summer ?
nicaragua .
why ? do you wanna come ?
i don &apos;t think this is what you expected
when you got involved with my daughter .
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
thank you for coming .
i &apos;m worried about hanna .
she &apos;s worried about you .
i can &apos;t help her from here .
i can &apos;t do anything from here .
i &apos;m worried about what she might do ...
if things don &apos;t work out .
did she say anything ?
nothing .
but i know how she thinks and ...
she wants results and she will charge
right into a situation without thinking and ...
she gets that from me .
i think she gets a lot of things from you .
she &apos;s brave , she &apos;s loyal ...
and stubborn .
she can be .
she &apos;s very angry right now ,
and i don &apos;t want her making any mistakes because of that .
she listens to you .
yeah , sometimes .
she does .
more than you know .
i &apos;ll do whatever i can .
thank you .
visiting hours are now up .
visitation is over .
mrs. marin ...
hanna loves you .
she would do anything for you .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of .
so you haven &apos;t been in a pool since ...
the accident ? no .
well , maybe we need to rethink handing you the power tools .
i mean , we can find something a little less physical .
no , i &apos;ll be fine by next summer .
it &apos;s not permanent , the injury .
it &apos;s all behind me .
i &apos;m not looking to swim in college and --
you don &apos;t need to sell yourself to me , emily .
i could write you a glowing recommendation in my sleep .
emily .
mom .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
oh , this is zoe , uh , my supervisor for habitat for humanity .
致力于消除全球贫困住房和无家可归的现象
oh , right , right . it &apos;s nice to see you .
i figured you were working today .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i had to meet with a second adjustor ,
and it looks like we &apos;re not gonna be back
in our house for months .
but i need to get this to the police ,
and i was wondering if maybe ...
yeah , i understand . you shouldn &apos;t have to walk in there .
i &apos;ll drop it off .
thanks .
i &apos;ll see you back at home .
well , back at the motel .
yeah .
it was really great to see you again .
you too .
you &apos;re living in a motel ?
yeah , just for now .
it &apos;s a long story .
sounds like you have a lot going on .
maybe i should &apos;ve checked in a little bit more
before i roped you into this again .
no , i wanna go with you guys next summer .
is the sign @-@ up form in here or should i do it online ?
where did you get the gun ?
i found it in my father &apos;s desk .
i was afraid of wilden ,
so i took it in case he ever tried anything .
they found your mother &apos;s fingerprints on the bullets .
i don &apos;t know anything about that .
look , my dad had that gun when he lived with me .
my mom probably loaded it once .
but i was the first one to ever shoot it .
and you shot it at wilden .
yes .
you followed him to the lake and you shot him .
that &apos;s right .
what was that like ?
what ?
you killed someone .
he was as close to you as i am
and you shot him .
what did that feel like ?
what the hell kind of question is that ?
the sort of question that will let them know
whether you &apos;re lying or telling the truth .
make me believe you were there .
tell me what you did .
hello , hanna .
look what i found .
mommy &apos;s not gonna be able to fix this one for you , hanna .
and just like that , you pulled the gun on him .
self @-@ defense , hanna .
remember ? we &apos;re going for self @-@ defense .
he must have said something , done something .
but maybe you can fix this one for yourself .
i mean , you are your mother &apos;s daughter .
i &apos;ve been tried to reach you .
i know .
i thought you were supposed to be with your dad .
he had a work thing .
hanna , what is she doing here ?
oh , it &apos;s so nice to see you , too .
caleb , look , mona found out about my mom
and she came here .
we just ...
we &apos;ve been through a lot ,
so we &apos;re just trying to move on .
mona doesn &apos;t move on , she goes right through .
don &apos;t you , mona ?
i don &apos;t have the slightest inkling
of what you &apos;re talking about .
caleb , you were looking for me ,
you found me , and i &apos;m okay .
like hell you &apos;re okay .
it &apos;s complicated and i don &apos;t do complicated .
okay , if my mom doesn &apos;t get out of jail ,
i have to move in with my dad , his wife ,
her blonde tarantula of a daughter .
so compared to that ,
talking to mona makes all the sense in the world .
it &apos;s my calming influence .
god , just leave me alone .
okay ? for now .
sure .
i &apos;ll leave you alone .
we &apos;re almost finished .
hey .
hi .
honey , your dad wants you to meet him
at the club for dinner .
we &apos;re gonna be working here for awhile .
okay .
i didn &apos;t hear you leave .
you were busy .
by the way ...
do you want me to slip that file back in the box
before your mother notices ?
what file ?
i &apos;ll take care of it .
suit yourself .
mike &apos;s phone .
who &apos;s this ?
mike &apos;s butler . who &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s his sister . can you just put him on the phone , please ?
hey , guys . guys , is mike back there ?
he &apos;s not conscious .
yet .
just put mike on the phone okay ?
now .
hello ?
hello ?
tell me again .
i saw him in town .
you saw who in town ?
detective wilden .
i followed him out to the lake ,
and i saw his car there .
but they found his car in town .
i don &apos;t know anything about that ,
but i saw his car at the lake .
did you see anyone else there ?
no .
wilden was ...
angry .
he &apos;s gonna blame all of this on my mom . i know it .
he &apos;s been after me and my mom .
why ?
because of what he did to ali .
no one believes us . no one will help us .
he wants to hurt my mom .
well , now it &apos;s his turn to be scared .
and i &apos;m gonna make him stop .
you did this .
i &apos;ll do worse if you don &apos;t leave us alone .
you &apos;re in very big trouble , hanna .
i can make your mother &apos;s life a living hell .
unless , that is , you and i work something out .
he hurt your mom . he wants to hurt you .
he &apos;s got all the power . nobody &apos;s going to help you .
you &apos;re the only one in the world who can do anything about it .
you &apos;re all alone out there .
bugs are getting in your hair
and the lake smells like something died in it .
what happened next ?
two , hanna .
you shot him twice .
and then i ran away .
who moved the car and put the body in the trunk ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is i killed him .
i shot him with my father &apos;s gun
&apos;cause he was after my mom
and no one was gonna help us .
are you sorry that you killed him ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry .
of course you are .
all you have to do now is tell the truth ...
and everything will be all right .
where do you think you are going ?
you didn &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna leave you alone with her , did you ?
hi .
have you heard from him ?
no .
where does the team usually hang after the game ?
i don &apos;t know . i just know that
they played richland .
uh , was he at a house party ?
well , it kind of sounded like
he was at a bowling alley , just not as loud .
there were all these crashes and pings and --
an arcade .
i know a place near there .
uh , you know , i don &apos;t remember the street .
okay , um ...
should we just get in your car and drive there ?
yeah , let &apos;s do it .
hold on , it &apos;s him .
mike , hey . where are you ?
your friend said that you were unconscious .
undressed ?
no , not undressed . unconscious .
he was just messing with you .
are you okay ?
yes , i &apos;m fine .
i might just stay at billy &apos;s tonight .
you &apos;re not coming home at all ?
it &apos;s three blocks away , okay ? i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
why would he just put me through that ?
he doesn &apos;t know i told you about his teammates .
so he probably doesn &apos;t know why tonight scared you so much .
right .
great , so now i &apos;m spying on him .
you &apos;re his sister .
mike &apos;s a great guy .
he &apos;s got his struggles , but he &apos;s working on &apos; em .
i think he can take care of himself .
you think ?
if it gets out of control , i &apos;ll tell you .
okay .
and honestly ...
i &apos;m more worried about you .
you want me to stay for a while ?
yeah , are you hungry ?
i &apos;ll take that as a yes .
and you let mona talk you into this ?
mona is helping me . it was my idea .
hanna , it &apos;s insane .
first of all , you can &apos;t do it .
second of all , you would never pull it off .
and third , i am not gonna let you do it .
i have to do this .
maybe &quot; a &quot; will settle for
ruining my life and leave my mother alone .
neither one of you is going to prison .
my mother &apos;s already there .
if they take her away tomorrow , i &apos;ll never get her back .
look , it &apos;ll be okay . i &apos;ll be fine .
you will be fine ?
hanna , you &apos;re talking about going to prison , okay ?
prison for kids is still prison .
you don &apos;t need to do something just because you feel guilty
about something that somebody else did .
you think she killed him .
you think my mom shot wilden .
i did , okay ?
until i talked to her today .
she never killed anyone .
i didn &apos;t know you were going shopping . i could &apos;ve helped .
i just picked up some of the essentials .
um , we &apos;re gonna try to eat out most of the time .
but ... did you drop off the --
yeah , and everybody at the precinct asked about you .
they &apos;re gonna want you back , mom .
i think they already feel bad .
it doesn &apos;t matter how they feel , em .
it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s already done .
i &apos;m gonna be starting to look for other work tomorrow .
i had a great meeting with zoe .
she &apos;s gonna write me a recommendation letter for college .
that &apos;s wonderful .
i &apos;m glad there &apos;s someone in your corner .
she &apos;s leading a crew in june to nicaragua ,
invited me to come .
wants me to join the group
for the whole summer until i start school .
she even said that she &apos;d give me some sort of leadership role
where i &apos;d be , like , a team captain or something
and supervise the new volunteers .
mom ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
it sounds like a great opportunity .
i don &apos;t have to go for the whole summer .
i can come back in august .
you know , see what happens with the house .
maybe if dad comes back , he can spend time ...
stop . you don &apos;t need ot organize your whole calendar around me .
this is a really important summer for you .
mom ...
have you eaten ?
why don &apos;t you let me make you something to eat ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we can eat later , okay ?
i &apos;ll fix you something .
i &apos;d like to speak to a detective
about a murder .
hey , i &apos;m sorry if i hijacked your night .
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m happy to be here .
now , what are you in the mood for ?
comedy ? rom @-@ com ? sci @-@ fi ?
insidious 2 .
have you seen the first one ?
twice .
this one looks even more terrifying .
fun terrifying .
it opens next weekend . you wanna go ?
sure , it &apos;s a ...
sounds good .
what did you think of beckett ?
i don &apos;t think anything yet .
you &apos;ll like him . he &apos;s smart .
did you talk to hanna ?
yeah , she &apos;s with her dad .
what &apos;s gonna happen to her mom ?
they &apos;ll move her to the state facility tomorrow ,
which is excessive
and interferes with my ability to mount a defense .
and i &apos;ll keep after judge reilly until she agrees to bail .
meanwhile , she stays in a cell ?
yeah .
oh , i should have warned beckett about you .
do you know what &apos;s in there ?
they &apos;re trying to choke us with wilden material .
most of it is useless .
that is not useless .
that is about wilden and radley and toby &apos;s mom .
wilden was at radley the night that toby &apos;s mom died ,
and what he wrote in his notes doesn &apos;t match the official report .
somebody paid him off to lie about the facts .
it &apos;s not relevant .
not relevant ?
wilden was crooked . he was always crooked .
spencer , you &apos;re done with radley .
be grateful for that .
mom , toby thinks his mother killed herself .
maybe she didn &apos;t .
and this links what happened out there with wilden .
honey , nothing we do or say is gonna bring back toby &apos;s mother .
if you want to help toby , help him move on .
yes ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
what do you mean ?
when did this happen ?
all right , i &apos;ll come right down there .
mona vanderwaal is at the police station .
she just walked in and confessed to killing wilden .
