Ray...
It's conforming.
It's not conforming.
It's saying you own me.
That's an old-fashioned way of looking at things.
I don't want to be a possession.
Marriage is about... love and commitment,
Not possession, baby.
Don't you want kids, sunday dinners?
I like sunday dinners.
Tying the knot would guarantee me front-row seats
to the movie of your life.
Don't you want someone to...
change your diapers when you get old?
Baby, if I ever need diapers,
you just take me right out back and shoot me.
Don't do it, son.
What are you saying?
Marriage.
Ruin your life.
Why don't you ring these up.
You get married, the romance fizzles,
Your girl gets fat.
Next thing you know you're lying on the couch
wondering how come you don't have a bed.
Marriage is overrated.
Marriage is overrated.
How's it going, stranger?
Oh, I'm a little tired. I went Salsa dancing last night.
Oh, my god, like I need another reason to find you amazing.
This call for you from Sean Mcallister,
came to my phone accidentally.
He sounded very hot and very important.
Did he leave a message?
No. But it's from Paris.
A Scottish guy calling from Paris.
Know this, Emily-- even if he is ugly,
Scottish guys are hot. It's the accent.
I'll keep that in mind.
So what's the skinny? Is he an ex?
International booty call?
No. He's a friend.
Where's Seaver?
She had to take a test at the academy.
I know we've all seen the news.
Mass murder in Miles City, Montana.
6 people shot and killed at a gas station.
Robbery?
No apparent motive.
Any security footage?
No. No cameras, no witnesses,
Ballistics say we're looking at two shooters.
Well, something at the station must have triggered them.
It doesn't look like they had much of a plan.
And it may happen again.
Spree killers often repeat themselves.
We did it, baby.
We did it.
That was awesome.
I love you, Ray.
Love you, too, Syd.
Friedrich Nietzsche wrote,
"What really raises one's indignation against suffering
is not suffering intrinsically,
but the senselessness of suffering."
I'm sorry to reroute you to Billings,
But last night, this went down.
Have you released a statement to the press?
No, but it's already hit the air.
Where's the car they dumped?
It's over there. Agents are searching it now.
One of the vics said the shooters were a male and a female.
How many people were murdered here?
8. If you add the Miles City killings, we're up to 14.
Male-female teams are usually committed to pleasing each other,
both mentally and physically.
These guys are thrill killers.
They're aroused by the adrenaline rush.
So they're not gonna stop until we catch them.
So this is just foreplay.
What's the news saying about us now?
They know we're male and female.
How did they figure that out?
I don't know.
There was nothing girly about the way we killed those people.
Where do you want to live, Ray?
I told you--Aruba. Right on the ocean.
I like the ocean.
So how do you want to spend the rest of our honeymoon?
Exactly the same way that we spent the last 12 months.
Till death do us part.
Nothing's gonna happen to us, Syd.
I mean, I've seen dead bodies before, but this is insane.
They're like Bonnie and Clyde.
They smashed one guy's vertebrae so bad,
it looked like a derailed train.
Extreme brutality to this degree
is what's known as an obliteration attack.
The unsub wants to completely erase these victims from existence.
Both of the vics were shot at point blank range.
What made those?
That was a crowbar.
Whew! Baby!
Ray, I'm hungry.
The unsubs are becoming more and more confident,
which means their weapons are becoming more and more personal.
The excitement of the brutality
allows them to overcome their human inhibitions.
Why is this one covered?
It's the store clerk. Guy got it pretty bad.
In medieval times, it would just be another monday.
He was sodomized with a tire iron.
That kind of overkill suggests
he was the root of their aggression.
Maybe they're zeroing in on what's really pissing them off.
They took the store owner in the back.
They got the schoolteacher over here.
The kid over here thought he was safe.
Why chain them in?
They thrive on sadistic power.
There's rice all over the floor.
Bullet probably hit a box.
I take it this is the food aisle.
I don't see rice for sale anywhere on these shelves.
Who comes to a gas station throwing rice?
Ok, I checked surrounding areas.
72 people applied for marriage licenses
in montana in the last 3 days.
Any of them have records?
31 do, the rest are clean.
All right. Send over all the
names of the suspects with their ages, Garcia.
Lover, they're all ready sent. Check your phones.
So you think they're newlyweds?
Well, there was rice all over the crime scene,
and a bunch of alcohol was missing from the store.
So they're on their honeymoon.
What did you find out from the M.E.?
Overkill on the store clerk and sodomy--object penetration.
Garcia, last 30 days, check any store clerks killed
in the states east of Montana.
Wow. Uh, there was a savagely beaten store clerk
outside Jamestown at the beginning of the month,
and then another one 2 days later in Bowman, North Dakota.
And that's probably where they started.
Thanks, Garcia.
Hey, there.
Are you drinking all alone tonight, honey?
My company's a little busy.
My name's Ray.
Hi, Ray. Hi, Ray.
I just got married.
And I'm an alcoholic.
Congratulations. Congratulations.
I'm just passing through town
and I wanted to stop and share
because I partied last night.
What do you think made you drink?
Come on. I was celebrating with my lady.
That's a big rock you got on your finger there.
I like things big.
I bet you do.
Well, I've been drinking my whole life.
I started when I was 8.
My father was an alcoholic.
It tastes like...
grape kool-aid.
Oh, I like kool-aid.
Whiskey and bourbon...
were his choice.
After he got his glass, he's come and he'd tuck me in.
First, he'd ask me about my day.
Then he'd, uh, he'd move his hands up my leg.
Told me everything was gonna be ok.
It was never ok.
20 bucks...
I'll let you have a taste.
Oh, you got a deal.
I'd just bury my head into my pillow and wait until it was over.
And when he was done,
I'd just lie there quietly.
It's nice of you to share with us, Ray.
What step have you gotten to?
7.
The same age I was when he did that to me.
Well, it's time for you to do 8 and 9.
Have you admitted your shortcomings?
This wasn't my fault.
But you've let this one incident
dictate your whole life.
I was a kid.
I know, Ray.
But until you let this go,
you will always be a victim to the bottle.
To the bottle, to the bottle, to the bottle...
Screw you and your bottle.
What happened to him?
He got fresh with me.
This is 100 miles west of the last gas station.
We anticipated them hitting this area, but not here.
Maybe this guy tried to have sex with one of our unsubs
while the other one was inside.
Cheating on your honeymoon.
Someone's got a twisted sense of commitment.
So they steal the liquor from the gas station,
they go on a binge, and then they come to a meeting?
What if the unsubs met at a meeting?
They hear each other's stories
and develop a bond because of their similar backgrounds.
That makes sense. People typically drink to excess
because they're unhappy with themselves or their past.
From the looks of it,
at least one of the unsubs shot from up front.
Run!
Well, if the meeting started at 8:00,
and this happened at 8:45,
They were probably in the sharing portion of the meeting.
So maybe they didn't come in here to kill.
You know, what if they really are struggling with sobriety?
If they're really working the program,
they could be working on the hardest steps.
Which are?
7, 8, and 9.
Acknowledge your shortcomings,
accept responsibility, and make amends.
The trouble is, these unsubs already broke
one of the most important steps.
What's that?
The thirteenth step.
Members aren't supposed to enter relationships with each other
while trying to get sober.
What are you thinking about?
We need to go to the next step.
All this killing and drinking is fun,
But it doesn't change the fact that, you know,
my father used to rape me,
or what your daddy did to you, you know.
What are you saying, Syd?
If you want to find closure,
you gotta go directly to the source.
We do 8 and 9?
Why not?
We're looking for a young couple from North Dakota,
Late teens to late 20s.
We believe they may have recently been married.
We're seeing that alcohol
plays a significant role in these crimes.
It's allowing them to kill freely and recklessly.
Our unsubs are killing surrogates
who represent those responsible for deep-seated wounds.
Now, these two most likely met at alcohol support.
And they get a sexual charge out of the kill.
The change from gas station to alcohol support meetings
suggests one of them might have a slight moral compass
that led them to get help.
Ultimately, we believe one of the pair
is a sociopath, while the other is a psychopath.
What's really the difference?
They're similar pathologies, but a sociopath
is less likely to participate in criminal activity
and can be lured by a dominant,
while a psychopath is a consummate leader
and likely to engage and destroy anyone in their way.
The most recent attack was 12 hours ago,
which means they're most likely heading west of Helena
and towards Idaho. All surrounding areas should be on alert.
This is it?
This is it.
This is it. This is your house.
Say Hi to me, baby.
Hi, baby.
You look good.
This is Ray's house.
Hey, baby. Kiss me.
You look good, baby.
Cute butt.
Yeah, can help you?
Raymond.
Say cheese.
Hi, Daddy.
Ray. Ray.
These alcohol support groups are based on anonymity.
There'll be no record of who attended the meeting.
Garcia, our unsubs attended an alcohol support meeting
last night, but they're not from the area.
Can you trace who accessed their website yesterday?
3 people went to that website,
one on a mobile, 2 on DSL.
Cross-check that with a list of anyone married in Montana
in the last 2 days.
No, no, I'm coming up empty.
See if anyone on the list who accessed the site
is from North Dakota.
Bingo, baby. Ray Donovan of Devil's lake.
Ironic.
What's his story?
He is 27. He's been in and out of foster care
since he was 10.
He looks like kind of a lush
and a bit of a meany.
He's had 2 DUIs in the last 2 years.
He was slapped with a restraining order
by an ex-girlfriend.
Sounds like our boy.
What's her name? She might be his partner.
No, she's not. Her name's Amy Wichowsky.
She died a year ago
of an overdose from a mix of alcohol and heroin.
Garcia, get us the address of the foster home.
Somebody there might know something.
Sure. Give me a sec.
I talked to all 4 of Ray's foster families.
They say he was removed from his parents' home
because of drugs and abuse.
Garcia.
Yes?
Can we confirm that with the biological family?
Ok. I'm gonna patch you through.
I want you to take the ninth step.
Take the ninth step? Why?
I didn't do anything.
I was put into foster care because of you,
you bastard.
You were put in foster care because of our drug problem.
Ray, no one molested you.
Put the gun down, Ray.
Shut up!
Take the ninth step or I'm gonna shoot you, dad.
I didn't do it.
I didn't touch you.
Ray, you're my own flesh and blood.
I never touched you.
Don't you lie!
I said I'll take care of it.
I swear it.
Take the ninth step.
I ain't taking no step.
Take it.
Take it.
I ain't gonna ask you again.
No!
Why did you do that, Syd?
'cause you wouldn't.
I would have. Look what you did.
Come on, Ray.
Look what you did, Syd!
Come on, Ray.
Look what you did!
It wasn't for you to do!
This was mine, Syd!
All right, so Ray must have been sitting right here,
playing Russian roulette with his Dad.
Mr. Donovan was shot from across the room.
Ray couldn't have done it sitting there.
Maybe he got mad,
went over by the door, shot him from there.
我们得谈谈
Prentiss.
You all right?
Yeah. It's nothing.
Uh, what if Ray didn't do it at all?
What if the girl pulled the trigger?
Well, why would Ray let her do that?
He was the one with the grudge.
Ray kept asking Paul to take the ninth step.
"Take the ninth step."
It sounds like they're making amends,
but they're twisting it,
trying to force people who have wronged them
to make amends to them.
Mrs. Donovan, did you hear the name of the girl
that Ray's with?
He kept calling her Syd.
Syd, I think.
Maybe she's the one calling the shots.
She's the psychopath.
Well, if she did do it without his consent,
they're going to be at odds.
The first marital fight is supposed to be the worst.
Well, it just might be the wedge that we need.
Ray...
Please don't be mad.
Baby. Baby!
I need a minute.
Let me talk to you. I'm going to tell you I'm sorry.
He touched me, not you.
Baby, just take it out on me.
Come on. Just take your frustrations out on me. Come on.
Come on, baby. Hit me. Hit me.
Stop it, Syd!
Hit me.
Stop it, Syd!
Yeah. Yeah.
Do it. Do it.
When I say I'm gonna handle something, I will handle it.
I understand, baby.
I am the man in this relationship.
I just want to make you feel better, baby.
Syd, a man takes care of things.
You understand me? Huh?
I understand. I understa.
I understand.
I'm serious, Syd.
I am, too. Mmm.
Ok, so, no Ray Donovan filed for a marriage certificate.
However, I looked at that list again,
and there's a Sydney Manning of Washington State
who filed for a marriage certificate 2 days ago in Montana.
Washington State? We profiled North Dakota.
Yes, she's lived in North Dakota for the last 4 years,
and it gets better, or worse, rather. It turns out
that Sydney was sentenced to mandatory rehab
after serving time for a hit and run
during which she was under the influence of alcohol and heroin.
Oh, so she didn't volunteer for alcohol support.
No, she was placed there as part of her parole.
Alcohol and heroin.
Isn't that the same combo that Ray's ex O.D.Ed on?
Yes, it is, my friend.
So both Syd and the ex have the same vice.
Garcia, check to see if there's
any juvie records of the ex we can access.
Amy was pulled out of high school
so she could go to rehab for alcohol dependency.
But no mention of the heroin?
What are you thinking?
Psychopaths will destroy anything in their path.
What if Amy was in Sydney's way?
Garcia, where is Sydney Manning's biological family?
Spokane, Washington.
And why was she pulled out of her home?
Her father was molesting her.
So Ray and Syd did meet
after sharing similar backgrounds in alcohol support.
And if they're sticking to the pattern of making amends,
Sydney's father's next on the list.
Reid, you stay at the command center in case they double back.
The rest of us are gonna go to Spokane.
*I want to take you back there*
*Can I take you back?*
*Are you ready?*
*Smoke-filled rooms with an amber glow*
*Whispers in your ear...*
This is about to get crazy.
*...movin' slow*
*Shadows dance all across the wall*
*Reflections are the revival*
Can I help you?
*You can't stop when the music's on your mind*
*Feel so alive*
Hey, daddy.
How you been?
What are you doing here, Sydney?
Have you heard of the ninth step?
*Are you ready*
What?
I got no idea what you're talking about.
Making amends.
Why don't you just put the gun away.
See, I don't want to put the gun away.
I want you...
to touch me.
What are you talking about?
I want you to touch me.
You used to like it.
Syd, put your skirt down.
I ain't puttin' down Jack.
Sydney--
What's the matter, daddy?
You don't like the way I look?
Sydney...
You're out of control.
No, no...
You were out of control.
Listen...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I've changed.
I've found god.
God?
Where was he every time you'd take me to that back room, huh?
I don't know.
Not here.
I don't know.
Not here.
Every time I'd hear that door chime,
somebody's gonna come save me?
It never happened.
God was nowhere near this place.
Please.
Sydney...
What do you want me to do?
There's nothing you can do,
you sorry piece of crap!
Yeah, baby.
Daddy? Daddy!
What are you doing to my dad?
May I help you?
Mrs. Manning, we're with the FBI.
Is your husband home?
He's at work. What is this about?
Your daughter Sydney-- we think she's planning on hurting him.
Sydney? That's Gary's kid.
He hasn't seen her in years.
Can you tell us your husband's work address, please?
Uh, 785 Halbrook street,off Kirkland road.
He owns a gas station.
Thank you.
Please, Sydney, don't do this.
Daddy!
I never hurt her. I never hurt her!
Of course you did it!
He didn't, I swear. Daddy!
Hey. Hey. Daddies don't do this to their daughters.
Hey, it's ok. It's ok.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Hey. Hey, honey.
You'll change your mind.
I did.
I want my daddy! My daddy!
Prentiss, get down! It's them! Get back!
Syd!
Syd!
Ray!
Syd! Syd!
Syd! Syd!
Syd! Syd...Syd!
Ray, they got me. They got me, baby.
You'll be ok.
It's not that bad, baby.
She needs a doctor.
I know what she needs.
Get me some whiskey.
There's no alcohol in here.
You're kidding me.
My dad doesn't drink. He says it's against the bible.
You don't have to protect him anymore. He's gone.
Get her a water.
Get her some water!
What do you want?
Mr. Donovan, how you doing in there?
How do you think I'm doing? You shot my girl.
No, it was one of my agents. He didn't have a choice.
He had a choice. He could've shot me. Now put him on the phone.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can. Put him on the phone.
He needs to fix this crap.
Morgan.
Hello, Ray.
You know, if you come out,
we can get Sydney to the hospital.
She doesn't need a hospital.
She's strong.
Don't be stupid.
You don't be stupid.
Now get your men out of here so we can continue on as planned.
We can't do that, Ray, and you know it.
You got a little girl inside.
And god only knows what happened to Sydney's father.
Justice happened to her father.
So he's dead?
Damn right he's dead, and his kid's gonna be, too,
if you don't get me a car to take us to Aruba.
All right. Let me see what I can do about that.
Is there anything else you need in the meantime?
Some gauze and some booze.
And none of them cheap kind, either.
It has now been 2 hours since Ray Donovan and Sydney Manning
Locked themselves inside this spokane gas station.
Two hostages are thought to be inside,
The owner of the station and his 10-year-old daughter.
What do they want?
Liquor and tickets to Aruba.
They're delusional.
You're not negotiating with them?
No, but we're gonna let them think we are.
Does she look like me?
I think she does.
I don't know, Syd.
Don't be scared. We're not gonna hurt you.
Syd...
What grade are you in?
Shh, Syd.
You need to preserve your energy.
Fourth grade.
I liked the fourth grade.
Stop talking to her.
Relax, Ray,
We're having a family reunion in aisle 3.
Be supportive.
Move back!
Move back or I kill this girl.
Back off! Back off!
I will shoot this kid!
Back off!
Back!
Kid, unlock that door. You got it?
Put your hand on the lock.
Just unlock it.
Got it?
Ok. Yes.
Ray? Take it easy, man.
Take it easy.
You take it easy.
Put it down!
All right.
Put it down.
We got you the stuff you asked for.
We're working on the rest.
Great.
If you need anything else, you just pick up that phone.
It's routed straight to us. You understand?
I should kill you right now.
Back up.
I'm leaving.
Back up!
Now, lock the door. You got it?
Let's go.
Lock it.
Stay here. Don't move.
Don't move.
Ok.
Did they say anything about the car?
Shh, baby.
Poor baby. Let me see.
Yeah?
Where the hell is our car?
I need you to listen to me for a second.
I know you've had a hard time,
with your father and everything that he did to you.
Shut up. You don't know anything about me.
Last year, your ex-girlfriend Amy was murdered.
I know that.
Amy committed suicide.
No, she was killed, Ray.
Nah. Amy O.D.ed on PCP and alcohol.
They found heroin in her system, Ray.
Amy never did heroin.
Exactly. Because somebody gave it to her.
Why don't you ask Sydney about it?
Why? What does she-- what does she have to do with this?
Ray, what's going on?
Come on, man, think for a second.
Sydney joined alcohol support right after you and Amy broke up.
She could see you still had feelings for Amy,
so Sydney needed Amy out of the way.
You're out of line, pal.
Then ask her. But I guarantee when you do,
she's not gonna answer you.
She's only gonna question you back, Ray.
What are you talking about?
Sydney is the one who gave Amy that heroin.
Ask her.
Hey, what-- what's wrong, Ray?
Ask her. Get her to come clean.
Did you give Amy heroin?
Baby, what are you talking about? I love you.
Listen--
There, you see that, Ray?
We call that structural deception.
She doesn't want to answer your question.
She's only buying herself some time,
so she can think of something else to say to you.
That's not true.
Ray, Sydney killed Amy.
And if you press her,
she's probably gonna try and use sexual distraction
to get you to change the subject.
Don't you talk about my wife like that.
What is-- what is he saying?
Sexual distraction, Ray.
You gotta listen to me.
No, I'm done listening to you.
Now, why don't you get us a car and some plane tickets,
or I am gonna blow this girl's head off.
It's ok. It's ok, sis.
It's ok. Baby,
Ray...
Why is he telling me that?
Why is he saying this to me?
I don't know. I don't know.
You wouldn't do that to Amy, would you?
Of course not, baby.
Hey, you know what we should do
while we're waiting to get out of here?
We should make love right here in front of them.
Yeah, that would really freak them out, wouldn't it?
Yeah?
Baby. Make love to me.
Right here in front of them. Yeah.
I think we got through to him.
This thing's gonna end.
He's gonna ask her again.
He has to.
The kid's our only priority.
Go back by the door.
I said go to the door!
Baby, we can do it,
while everybody's watching us.
All right.
Ray, that's so hot. It's so hot, Ray.
You know, the first time I saw you,
I knew I had to have you.
You were the yin to my yang, Ray.
Till death do us part, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, right.
Till death do us part.
Oh, baby.
Syd.
Syd.
What's happening in there?
Ray's pacing.
That is not good.
What did you do to her?
Syd? Syd! Please, Syd.
Wake up, Syd.
Baby, wake up. Come on.
Syd, please wake up.
Please.
Please.
Please, Syd.
Enough's enough, baby.
I see the girl.
Where's Sydney and Ray?
Morgan, go.
No!
Syd!
