look at them go ,
our every ready serviceman enjoy a little r &amp; r
on the exotic island of oahu ,
the gathering place of the hawaiian islands ,
where a veritable tropical paradise
meets a bustling metropolis .
but after a day of sand and surf ,
it &apos;s back to work for these lucky boys
serving uncle sam
on the most beautiful place on earth .
keep up the good work , fellas !
america &apos;s proud of you !
morning , red .
steak and egg special please .
just the way i like it .
what the hell was that ?
artillery practice ?
someone better tell those guys it &apos;s sunday .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
what the hell is going on ?
japs are bombing the island .
december 7 , 1941 ...
president roosevelt called it
&quot; a date which will live in infamy . &quot;
on that peaceful sunday morning over 70 years ago ,
american forces withstood an unprovoked attack
and our nation was thrust headlong
into the largest global conflict in human history .
and though the guns have fallen silent ,
we still gather at this very spot
where the attack took place to honor the survivors ...
and the fallen--
members of our greatest generation--
and resolve to take care of them
as they took care of us .
you must know ...
that we will never , ever forget
the sacrifices you made for your country .
i gotta tell you , pearl harbor day , it always gets to me .
every year .
every single one of these veterans here today ,
they are the definition of the word &quot; hero . &quot;
they experienced all the horrors of war ,
and then they come home , they drop their duffel bags off ,
and they go back to work supporting their families
the next day like nothing ever happened .
they certainly set the bar high .
amazing .
what the hell are you doing ?
killing the man that murdered my father .
take a seat , sir .
what &apos;s this guy in for , bingo brawl ?
tried to shoot one of the veterans at the memorial today .
mr. toriyama , where &apos;d you get this gun ?
it was my service weapon .
and you can call me david .
you &apos;re a veteran , david ?
korean war .
did these come with this ?
you realize if you pulled the trigger ,
this thing would have malfunctioned ,
probably blown up in your face .
then maybe you shouldn &apos;t have stopped me .
you said your name is mcgarrett ?
hasn &apos;t changed since the last time you asked me .
have we met before ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
i know you from somewhere .
sir .
sir , you said ezra clark killed you father .
how do you know that ?
i was there .
that man is a murderer and a thief .
he dishonored my family
and he dishonors the united states military .
okay , you know what ? take it easy . all right ?
they &apos;re some serious charges .
ezra clark is a decorated soldier .
now , if he killed your father ,
why wasn &apos;t he prosecuted ?
son , if you know anything about world war ii ,
you &apos;d know that a japanese accusing a white soldier of a crime ...
any crime would never be taken seriously .
okay , what about after the war ?
i tried .
but the police said there wasn &apos;t enough evidence
to open an investigation .
okay , when did this alleged crime take place ?
may 24 , 1943 .
approximately 3 : 15 in the afternoon .
why would ezra clark kill your father ?
our katana .
ezra clark shot my father for it .
a samurai sword .
that &apos;s right .
and it belonged to my family for centuries ,
passed down from generation to generation .
if what you &apos;re telling us is true ,
why are you going after clark now ?
my wife passed away 20 years ago .
and in august , my only child died in a car accident .
i couldn &apos;t dishonor them while they were alive ,
but now , finding justice is all i have left .
excuse me , david .
so , uh , what do you think ? you believe him ?
why would he lie ?
i don &apos;t know .
it was a long time ago , what he &apos;s talking about , right ?
this guy served his country .
we owe it to him to find the truth .
if that is the truth ,
it &apos;s been buried for about 70 years .
last time i checked ,
there &apos;s no statute of limitations for murder .
our life on the island was beautiful before the war .
i was ten , and my brother kenji was 17 .
he was a great student ,
terrific athlete and my hero .
hey , who do you like best ,
joe dimaggio or hank greenberg ?
are you kidding me ?
it &apos;s like asking me what &apos;s better , chocolate or strawberry .
you know , they &apos;re both great , right ?
yeah .
aloha , boys !
mrs. kennedy !
we lived in a house on damon street in the manoa valley .
leave that outside .
everybody knew us , and we knew them .
kenji , you &apos;re looking really sharp out there .
a lot better than last year .
thanks , dad .
my father james taught history at punahou school ,
a 100 @-@ year @-@ old institution .
it &apos;s where president obama went .
my mother martha was very civic @-@ minded :
active in the pta and community theater .
she also worked for her father ,
who was a hawaiian territorial senator .
all right , let &apos;s get down to business .
topic of the day :
if you could invent one thing to make your everyday life easier ,
what would it be ?
oh , i got this . that &apos;s easy .
kenji would want a machine that makes girlfriends .
well , david &apos;s gonna build a robot
that cleans his room and takes out the trash .
you boys .
that &apos;s a good one , too .
david , eat your vegetables .
they &apos;re not so bad .
listen to you mother , she &apos;s always right .
our neighborhood was a special place .
a big melting pot .
there was never any trouble , all of us got along great .
but then everything changed on december 7th .
in the weeks that followed ,
the military began arresting prominent japanese .
teachers , bankers , lawyers ,
buddhist priests , newspaper editors ,
and our community leaders .
i &apos;ll never forget the day they came for my family .
president lincoln &apos;s speech in springfield was like a prophecy .
he warned of the tragic consequences of a civil war .
he said , &quot; a house divided against itself cannot stand . &quot;
are you james toriyama ?
y @-@ yes .
you &apos;re under arrest .
under arrest ? what &apos;s the meaning of this ?
what ... on what charges ? what &apos;s going on here ?
why am i being arrested ? !
who are you ? what do you want ?
you &apos;re being detained by order of the united states government .
on what charge ?
mind your manners , jap .
now you got two minutes to get your things together .
only take what you can carry .
you can &apos;t do this .
we &apos;re american citizens ! we have ri--
no ! no ...
now you got one minute .
hurry , boys .
do what he says .
what about our house and the rest of our things ?
anything that you can &apos;t carry
is now property of the united states government .
and if i were you , i &apos;d get going .
come on , lady ... let &apos;s go !
that &apos;s right , keep walking !
over here ! get in line !
take a seat !
you , move over !
that &apos;s right , there &apos;s room for everybody .
james ! james !
martha ?
martha ...
james !
martha !
over here !
martha !
get in line !
are you all right ?
i &apos;m okay .
it &apos;s okay , son .
we &apos;re together now .
move it . let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s do what he says .
i was only ten ,
but i &apos;ll never forget that humiliation .
paraded like p.o.w. &apos; s
in front of friends and neighborswe had grown up with .
and we were as american as they were .
they kept us in jail for a while ...
until
we were relocated to a camp
outside a gulch in waipahu .
its name was honouliuli internment camp ,
but we called it &quot; hell valley &quot;
because it was so damn hot .
and it wasn &apos;t a camp at all .
it was more like a prison .
guard towers and searchlights .
there was barbed wire .
armed soldiers patrolled the perimeters
and would shoot anyone trying to escape .
we just couldn &apos;t get over the shock of being imprisoned .
everybody lost their homes and businesses .
boys , why don &apos;t you take those two over there ?
take that one .
we were looked upon as traitors in our own country .
but let me tell you something .
during the entire war , there was not one single incident
of treason ever committed by japanese @-@ americans !
not a one !
so , apparently , david toriyama is who he says he is .
he &apos;s a widower , no surviving family ,
taught for 25 years in the public school system .
and yes , when he was a kid ,
he was an internee at honouliuli .
service record ?
well , it &apos;s pretty impressive , actually .
he served in korea and was personally cited
by douglas macarthur for bravery at the battle of inchon .
okay . um ...
what about his father ?
anything on him -- james toriyama ?
well , here &apos;s where the information conflicts
with what david told us .
now , camp operations was under the jurisdiction
of the army provost marshal general ,
but the official camp history is in
the national archives . i was able to access it ,
and i found only one reference to a james toriyama .
he was killed by a fellow internee in may of 1943 .
david , as it turns out ,
your father was killed
during a fight with another internee .
where did you learn that ?
from the official record .
that might be the official record ,
but it &apos;s not the truth .
so you &apos;re saying there was a cover @-@ up ?
what have i been telling you ?
my father was murdered by a gi
and it was buried because he was japanese !
yeah , danny .
i got a hit on ezra clark .
pulled up a juvenile record .
apparently , this guy had
a permanent spot on santa &apos;s naughty list .
all right , give me the highlights .
okay . he was considered a troubled youth
with years of repeat offenses
and a tendency toward violent behavior .
last case he caught , he got into a beef ,
broke a bottle over a kid &apos;s face ,
cut him up pretty good . judge labeled him high risk .
gave him two choices : the army or jail .
looks like he might get the chance to experience both .
leave ! before i call the cops !
uh , sir , we are the cops .
i never heard of five @-@ o.
okay , uh , how about here--
i &apos;ll show you my badge again .
son , are you implying i can &apos;t see or read ?
no , of course not .
i &apos;m sorry . i just figured
you &apos;d remember us from this morning .
well , i don &apos;t !
mr. clark , we just want to get some answers , that &apos;s all .
ma &apos;am , no offense ,
but i don &apos;t care for the police ,
so unless you &apos;re here for some other reason ,
i suggest you get the hell out of my house !
yeah , we will
as soon as we &apos;re done talking to you .
you were a guard at the honouliuli camp .
you remember a family-- the toriyama family--
specifically , a james toriyama ?
james tori ... what ? seriously ?
i can &apos;t remember what i had for breakfast ,
let alone some jap from 70 years ago .
yeah , &apos; cause they all look alike , right ?
that &apos;s what we called the enemy back then .
there &apos;s nothing between the lines !
okay , well , when you say it , it sounds personal .
i &apos;m just saying .
listen to me .
we were at war .
those people were our enemies !
what were &quot; those people &quot; &quot; to you before the war ?
get out !
one more question :
did you kill james toriyama ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here ?
to accuse me of murder ?
answer the question .
did you kill james toriyama and steal his katana ?
no . now get out before i lose my temper !
dad ?
are you all right ?
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s okay , honey .
my daughter linda .
kinda takes the wind right out of your sails , doesn &apos;t it ?
if i hated the japanese so much ,
why would i have married one ?
mr. toriyama ?
can i help you ?
uh , just came in to see if you needed anything .
you okay ?
yeah , yeah . thank you .
if i may , sir , i &apos;d like to shake your hand .
you do know i was going to murder a man today .
you were a soldier .
you know guns .
i think you know your weapon wasn &apos;t going to fire .
i think you went to pearl harbor today to make a point ,
not kill a man .
what &apos;s your name , son ?
chin ho kelly .
korean ?
it &apos;s in the mix .
a little japanese as well .
in fact , i had an uncle who spent
some time at the sand island camp .
you have a family , son ?
not yet .
when you do ...
make sure you tell your children
what happened to us .
they must never forget .
if you need anything at all , just let me know .
excuse me .
thank you .
ezra clark give you anything ?
besides attitude ?
not much .
well , the medications he &apos;s taking
is for treatment of alzheimer &apos;s and dementia .
my aunt lois is on the same pill regimen ,
so it &apos;s possible , depending on what stage he &apos;s in ,
he might not even really remember whether or not
he killed david &apos;s father .
it &apos;s also possible he has selective memory .
some of those guards at those camps
weren &apos;t exactly known for their humanity .
in fact , there were plenty of cases
where internees were actually killed by them ,
allegedly for resisting orders .
hey , what are we gonna do about mr.toriyama ?
we can &apos;t keep him here .
i still don &apos;t understand .
how come i &apos;m not under arrest ?
who says you &apos;re not ?
i &apos;m placing you under house arrest , all right ?
you &apos;re to stay here until we get to the bottom of it .
you &apos;re going to investigate my case ?
yes , i am . that &apos;s my job .
but there &apos;s one thing i need from you :
soldier to soldier ...
i need your word that you &apos;re telling me the truth .
i am .
okay .
that &apos;s good enough for me .
thank you .
no , don &apos;t thank me yet .
you got a picture of that stolen katana ?
that &apos;s my mother .
ah , and here &apos;s my father .
who &apos;s this soldier ?
that &apos;s my brother kenji .
he didn &apos;t want to stay in the camp so he enlisted .
many of the nisei his age did the same .
he was in a unit
that was composed mostly of japanese @-@ americans--
the 442nd regimental combat team .
yeah , the 442nd purple heart battalion .
they were the most decorated infantry unit
in the , in the history of the united states army .
their motto was &quot; go for broke . &quot;
good to know you weren &apos;t sleeping
in your annapolis class during that lesson .
what happened to kenji ?
killed in action .
italy .
not a day goes by that i don &apos;t miss my brother .
ah , here &apos;s the sword .
beautiful .
yes .
brilliant piece of craftsmanship from the koto era .
up until that time ,
katana were regarded as evil and ugly .
but swords like this were considered
deeply spiritual , pure and benevolent .
there &apos;s , um ... there &apos;s an inscription in it .
&quot; heaven favors the strong and the just . &quot;
mr.toriyama , i &apos;d like to borrow this photograph , please .
i &apos;d like to run it through a crime database of stolen artifacts ,
see if your sword has popped up anywhere in the last 70 years .
yes , of course .
thanks .
steve ?
that &apos;s my grandfather .
this man right here is my grandfather .
what is he doing in your family album ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s his name ?
he @-@ he looks like he was in the navy .
his name was steven mcgarrett . he was an ensign .
and he served on the arizona .
and he died in the attack on pearl harbor .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , i &apos;d like to state , for the record ,
that i am confused .
we got an old guy with a gun
who made a premeditated decision to kill somebody .
and we don &apos;t lock him up ,
instead we , uh , we run errands for him .
this isn &apos;t a street crime .
and it &apos;s not about money .
this case is about honor .
his method , it was wrong .
i don &apos;t condone it .
but we owe it to him to ,
at the very least , investigate .
okay , i see what &apos;s happening .
you know what you &apos;re becoming , right ?
bet you &apos;re gonna tell me , aren &apos;t you ?
a big softie .
i was right .
with a bleeding heart , which somehow you now have .
i mean , i don &apos;t know , maybe ...
maybe you &apos;re becoming a human being , steve .
welcome .
so , this is where the army stores all its old mp records .
how old is &quot; old &quot; ?
well , the military &apos;s been in hawaii
since the mckinley era--
that &apos;s what ? 120 years .
oh , that &apos;s good . we can go find king tut .
please , after you .
come on .
uh , you know , uh , how i feel about cramped spaces like this .
i &apos;ll hold your hand , come on .
claustrophobia is not something you make fun of , steve , okay ?
we &apos;ll hold a telethon .
come on .
you &apos;re a jerk , you know that ?
let &apos;s go .
what is that sound ? is that rain ?
it &apos;s rats .
you could &apos;ve lied .
looks like these are all tagged by year .
looking for 1943 .
yeah , i &apos;m in the &apos; 60s here .
&apos;57 .
right here .
&apos;43-- i got it .
let &apos;s see what we got .
nice little rat condo ?
all right , january .
february ...
may , here we go .
uh , they &apos;re mp daily reports , duty logs ...
what is that ?
it &apos;s an s.i.r.
what &apos;s an s.i.r. ?
a &quot; serious incident report . &quot;
the writing &apos;s pretty faded .
yeah , but look right there-- it says may 24 .
that &apos;s the time the old man said the murder took place .
all right , pack all this up .
get everything back to the lab .
everything ?
everything .
here it is .
type of criminal activity--
murder by shooting .
victim &apos;s name--
james toriyama .
this looks like the , uh , witness report .
that &apos;s interesting .
uh , ezra clark is a witness , not , uh , an offender .
all right , page three .
where &apos;s the rest of it ?
that &apos;s all there is .
what do you mean that &apos;s all there is ?
there &apos;s no description of the actual events .
maybe it ended up , uh , rat kibble .
i don &apos;t think so .
you see this jagged tear mark ?
it &apos;s longer than the others and discolored along the edges .
i think it was torn off .
all right , go back to , uh , page one .
let &apos;s see if we can work out who wrote this .
there .
george , george p ...
is that a p ? it &apos;s &quot; george p. &quot;
it &apos;s good , all we got to do is find george p.
if he &apos;s alive ,
and maybe he can tell us what happened .
and if that page is just missing
or it was actually torn out deliberately .
if that &apos;s the case , david toriyama was right .
this was a cover @-@ up .
yeah , danny .
ho , what are you doing ? where are you ?
i &apos;m at the house .
i &apos;m just going through some of my grandfather &apos;s stuff .
seeing if i can find a connection to david toriyama .
and ?
nothing yet . what about you ?
i reached out to the pentagon and all the veterans organizations .
as far as i can tell ,
there was no one in the honouliuli mp
unit with the name george p.
yeah , and i had catherine ask david .
he said he never heard of the guy either .
the name had to come from somewhere .
hey , you get any hits on the sword
from the stolen artifacts database ?
nothing .
okay , so that means it could still be with the person
who stole it and then killed james toriyama .
right now , ezra clark .
yeah , that &apos;s what david thinks .
except , after 70 years , memories fade ,
and david might not be remembering all the details .
you know what we need to do ?
we need to jar his memory .
the main guard tower was here .
an american soldier sat up there
behind a 30 @-@ caliber machine gun .
someone was watching our every move .
this is where my mother had her garden .
the ground was so sandy .
she could only grow root vegetables--
parsnips , carrots , radishes .
and this is where she collapsed
when we got the news that kenji had been killed in italy .
listen .
can you hear her cry ?
i still can .
here .
right here .
this is the place .
this is where we lived .
david !
nice throw , son .
david , stay here . i &apos;ll be right back .
are you sure , david ?
that ezra clark pulled that trigger ?
i &apos;ve thought about that face
every day for the last 70 years .
so david was here ,
25 yards away from the tents .
and according to ezra clark &apos;s statement ,
he was posted here , just 10 yards away .
well , david said he responded to the sound of a gunshot , right ?
he goes in , he finds his father on the floor
bleeding from a head wound .
all right , well , ezra had the means ,
he had the opportunity .
wait a second , though .
if ezra stole the sword , why would he stick around ?
and no one , not even david , said that he had it on him .
well , maybe he stashed it and came back and got it later .
or maybe ezra didn &apos;t kill james .
maybe he was responding to the same gunshot that david heard .
he went in , got blood on himself trying to revive him .
charlie , what do you got ?
i used a forensic laser on the incident report
to bring up the missing signature .
the first name is definitely &quot; george &quot;
but the last name did not start with &quot; p , &quot;
as we originally thought .
it &apos;s an &quot; r. &quot;
the diagonal stroke was missing .
guy you &apos;re looking for
is an ex @-@ cop named george rigby .
yeah , dad passed away in &apos; 92 .
he was with hpd for 30 years .
moved up the ladder from beat cop to administration .
what about world war ii ?
well , he was with homicide .
even though hawaii was under martial law ,
they still needed cops ,
and dad was just too old to be drafted .
let me help you with that .
yeah .
dad always wanted to be a writer .
that &apos;s why he kept all his case work .
he never got around to that novel .
if what you &apos;re looking for exists ,
it &apos;s in here .
i gotta tell you , man ,
this guy rigby didn &apos;t miss a trick .
i mean , he &apos;s got notes of
every single crime scene he was ever on ...
the witness descriptions ...
i mean , the details are incredible .
hold on , hold on ...
what ?
this is it .
all right , ezra clark &apos;s witness statement .
&quot; i heard a gunshot and responded .
saw a guy run out the back of the tent .
he wasn &apos;t one of the camp guards ,
but i had seen him hanging around before . &quot;
well , does he identify the guy ?
no , not here .
all right , keep flipping pages .
i &apos;m telling you , if rigby was half the cop
that he seems to be ,
he had to run down that lead .
got it .
rigby i.d. &apos; d the guy as joseph archer .
he was the kid brother of albert archer ,
who was the head guard at the camp .
all right .
that explains the missing page .
joseph commits a murder ,
and then albert rips out the page of the incident report
to protect his little brother .
chin , was joseph a gi ?
no , but i &apos;m guessing he must &apos;ve
paid his brother a visit at the camp ,
and then used his access to rip off some internees .
what else you got on archer ?
well , he was in and out of trouble his whole life .
mostly petty stuff , uh ... property and auto theft .
uh , then in 1952 , he graduated to the big time
and was arrested for murder .
he died in halawa serving out a life sentence .
we need to run down that homicide report .
i &apos;m way ahead of you .
the murder weapon was a 0.38,
and it &apos;s still in hpd custody .
all right , they never did an autopsy on david &apos;s father ,
so the bullet could still be inside his body .
chin , where was james toriyama buried ?
there &apos;s a little cemetery near the camp .
ah , it &apos;s no more than a potter &apos;s field .
if we could find that bullet
and match it to that gun , we &apos;ve got our killer .
firing one !
it &apos;s a match .
how you doing ? five @-@ o.
you thomas archer ?
yes .
grandson of joseph archer ?
that &apos;s right .
uh , what can i do for you ?
you ever seen this ?
sure . that &apos;s my grandpa &apos;s sword .
do you know where it is ?
may i ?
is there something wrong ?
do you have any idea how your grandfather got this sword ?
where ... ?
how ... ?
mr. toriyama ,
ezra clark did not kill your father .
the man who pulled the trigger
was named joseph archer .
he was a career criminal who died
while serving a life sentence in the penitentiary .
on behalf of the united states government ,
we &apos;d like to return this property to you ,
its rightful owner ...
and extend our most humble apologies .
david ...
one more thing .
excuse me .
sir ...
i believe i owe you an apology .
thank you .
i remembered why your grandfather &apos;s picture
was in our family photo album .
there was this young serviceman
who used to come to our house for tutoring .
he and his wife were about to have another child
and he wanted better for them ,
so he asked my father
to help him prepare for an officer aptitude test .
for three months , he would come over after dinner ,
and ... when he had spare time ,
he &apos;d play catch with me .
that man was your grandfather ...
steven mcgarrett .
and the last time i saw him
was december 6 , 1941 .
the night he gave me this .
it was a gift for ...
my father &apos;s help .
you have his heart .
that &apos;s how i remembered .
mahalo .
