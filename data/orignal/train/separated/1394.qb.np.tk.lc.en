so we &apos;re gonna change that one .
i &apos;m back .
okay , let me see , let me see , let me see !
you guys are want to , um ...
oh , my god !
i love it !
all clear .
okay , so--
so good ! it is so good !
for the last few months ,
cam and i have been redoing a house together
that we &apos;re gonna flip ,
and i have to say , it has been goin &apos; great !
we make an amazing team .
yeah . the key is trust .
absolutely .
the key is , i let claire think she &apos;s in charge .
i hide what i want in something bigger and more expensive .
then when she rejects that ,
we &quot; compromise &quot; on what i wanted all along .
i call my method &quot; the trojan horse . &quot;
you know how i got lily ?
i asked mitchell for triplets .
you are going to love what i found for the kitchen countertops .
it &apos;s from carrarra , itlay .
it &apos;s where michelangelo got the marble
to make the &quot; david . &quot;
now we know why the &quot; david &quot; couldn &apos;t afford any clothes .
okay , well , uh ...
i also found this one .
it &apos;s not as nice , but it &apos;s less expensive .
well , it &apos;s still over budget , but ...
i guess it &apos;s okay .
by the way , we couldn &apos;t get the powder room fixtures you wanted .
what ? why ?
well , they &apos;re 23 % , or $ 982 , over the budget .
keeping in mind , that space is only
12 % of 1,462 square feet .
whenever i need to rein in cam &apos;s spending ,
i employ something that i like to call &quot; the number dump . &quot;
so ... unless you wanna cut 16 % ,
or $ 1,764 from somewhere in the flooring budget ,
we &apos;ve gotta find another 4 % overall .
yeah . no , as long as they &apos;re pretty , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
yesterday , i accidentally said &quot; eleventy @-@ five . &quot;
so everybody knows how hard i worked on that project .
i mean--
hey , wait . what are you doing ?
trying to put the sugar back in the thing .
well , just go get the broom .
i &apos;ll eat it for a dollar .
what did i say about eating things for money ?
charge the most . then people will think you &apos;re worth it .
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s at least $ 5 .
hey , he said a dollar .
broom .
hey , dad , i can &apos;t find my scarf ,
and the closet light &apos;s burnt out .
so just change it .
i can &apos;t reach it .
oh , if only there was some magical way
of getting up closer to the ceiling .
okay , now you just sound like dylan .
i &apos;m saying get a step stool .
one thing at a time , okay ?
what is happening ?
i &apos;m sweeping .
no , you &apos;re not sweeping .
you &apos;re just spreading it all around .
it &apos;s gonna cost more if you want me to eat it now .
that &apos;s when it hit me--
my daughters know nothing about home care and maintenance .
i don &apos;t want &apos; em to be dependent .
it &apos;s up to me to show them what a modern ,
self @-@ sufficient woman looks like .
careful . keep that up ,
he &apos;ll have to hit &quot; numero dos &quot; when he calls the dmv .
by the time , he &apos;s old enough to call ,
tt will be &quot; numero uno . &quot;
ay , there he is .
manny , why did you have breakfast alone outside ?
i felt like eating breakfast alfresco .
does that mean he had his pants off ?
because if i can &apos;t , he can &apos;t .
jay , he &apos;s been eating outside on his own all week .
do you think that he feels left out
because of all the attention i give joe ?
you know , i &apos;ve been wondering the same thing .
tell you what--why don &apos;t i have some father @-@ son time
with joe this afternoon
and give you some time with manny ?
ay , that &apos;s so sweet .
you can take joe to his baby class .
gloria , i think he already knows how to be a baby .
i love you , but i can &apos;t laugh at that again .
manny , how about i pick you up after school ,
and we both have a special day ?
well , i did talk to jay
about getting some tickets for this reading .
what reading ?
seriously ?
the stage reading of &quot; moby dick &quot; ?
i told you about it last night .
i have zero recollection of this .
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have poured you that second scotch .
sorry , buddy , but i already committed
to spending the afternoon with joe
so you and your mom could have more time together .
hey , maybe she can take you .
can we , mom ?
of course , mi amor .
it &apos;s your special day . we &apos;ll do whatever you want .
great . this is gonna be four hours you &apos;ll never forget .
hey , buddy . looks like it &apos;s just the dos of us .
why do i feel that you did something shifty ?
i have no idea .
but i gotta say , it &apos;s not your best quality .
all right , sweetie , you have a good day .
watch me play handball , daddy .
oh , okay .
next !
that &apos;s milo . he beats everybody .
next loser !
he &apos;s mean .
yeah , i &apos;m gettin &apos; that .
next !
that &apos;s you .
another girl ?
hey , sweetie ? sweetie ?
you &apos;re gonna do great , okay ?
if you say so .
next !
uh , milo ? that-- that was my fault .
i distracted her ,
so maybe she could just go again ?
no do @-@ overs . next !
well , i &apos;m next , and i would like to give her my turn .
no switcheroos . are you playing or not ?
no .
chicken . next .
i hate bullies . i &apos;ve hated them my whole life .
i hated them when they were named scott dworkin
or greg pechenko or katie greenwald .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m gonna play .
but , daddy , he &apos;s really good .
well , i &apos;m really good , too .
but it &apos;s a sport .
i got this .
you done talking ?
you know , it &apos;s really appropriate that we &apos;re at a school ,
because i &apos;m about to teach you a lesson .
next !
all right . sorry , sweetheart .
here , i &apos;ll walk you to class .
no , thank you , mister .
but ...
whatcha doin &apos; ?
i think i have an idea .
okay . every house needs a &quot; wow &quot; factor , right ?
what is the one thing this backyard is missing ?
a qualified buyer ?
now don &apos;t be silly .
no . a water feature with a fire element .
oh , god , no .
no , no , please . now just imagine--
this entire back wall
cascading into a reservoir that erupts into flames
on the quarter hour . how does that sound ?
like we need a white tiger .
maybe i &apos;m being a little ambitious .
so let &apos;s just do a couple dancing water fountains ,
call it a day .
no , wait . cam , cam , cam .
that &apos;s gonna still put us , like ,
$ 3,500 over our landscape budget .
right now , we &apos;re 40 @-@ 12 percent higher than i thought
we &apos;d be at this point because smitty added that 8 % surcharge .
i &apos;m sorry--did you just say 40 @-@ 12 percent ?
mm , no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did . you do this all the time .
you just throw numbers at me to frighten and confuse me .
and here i thought we were working so well together ,
and you &apos;re just being manipulative .
what about you , cam ?
pitching these crazy , over @-@ the @-@ top ideas
just so you can slip in what you really want .
oh , how dare you accuse me of trojan horsing you .
you have a name for it ?
no , i mean--
you know what ? i will not stand here
and be accused by the likes of you .
and if there was a door here , missy ,
i would slam it in your face .
i thought we weren &apos;t flaming till the quarter hour !
gloria and manny left me alone with joe ,
and it was great ... for about 20 minutes .
then the little bugger turned on me .
i tried everything to calm him down--
bouncing . bottle .
brightly colored objects .
bigger bottle .
so i did the old &quot; put him in the car &quot; trick .
but i could still hear him out there .
i &apos;m just kidding .
i drove him to his little class ,
but he dozed off right before we got there .
or he took a page from the jay pritchett playbook--
saw the crap he was in for and pretended to be asleep .
mr. pritchett ?
yeah .
rachel lissy .
claire &apos;s friend from high school , remember ?
how could i forget ?
you knocked down my mailbox with your k @-@ car .
again , i apologize .
how you doin &apos; ?
couldn &apos;t be better .
i &apos;ve been married for 15 years ,
two great boys over there .
cooper ! unhand your brother !
i &apos;m taking them to the james bond movie ,
and they don &apos;t want me to sit with them .
i miss babies .
oh , they &apos;re a lot of fun , huh ?
so nice to see you .
nice seeing you .
great kids .
ugh ! no , you &apos;re not !
joe , i found a better way for us to bond ...
james bond .
my dad taught me everything there is to know about maintaining a home ,
and today , that tradition continues .
voila ! light bulb changed .
hey , i have an idea .
let &apos;s get to know the house , huh ?
hey , i have an idea--
let &apos;s lock him in .
okay . let &apos;s go over this baby right here .
what are we lookin &apos; at , huh ?
photosynthesis ?
in a sense , yeah .
yeah ?
yeah , yeah .
uh , photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide
into food for plants .
this water heater converts cold water into hot .
what converts this conversation into over ?
girls , you need to learn these things .
you might find yourselves living alone at some point .
i long for the day .
okay , we &apos;re just gonna start with something really basic , all right ?
i am turning the pilot light off .
these things go out occasionally .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . no one knows .
let &apos;s just say gremlins do it .
but if it happens to you , what do you do ?
call a guy .
or a girl .
oh , my god , we &apos;re literally in a closet ,
and you just said that .
focus .
you don &apos;t call anyone . to re @-@ light the pilot ,
turn the valve to &quot; pilot , &quot;
you press it down to begin the flow of gas ,
you wait a few seconds ...
where you guys from originally ?
and you just press the igniter .
there you go .
that &apos;s odd . why is it not working ?
oh , i got it .
why don &apos;t we just fill it up with hot water from the tap ?
found another light that &apos;s out .
claire and i were at a stalemate on the water feature .
so i brought in an experienced professional
to help break the tie .
pam also happens to be a friend
and a fellow gay parent at lily &apos;s school .
am i trying to stack the deck against claire here ?
no . i would never be so ...
genius .
oh . oh , claire , this is pam .
pam , claire .
oh , hi . nice to meet you .
you , too .
pam is a licensed contractor .
done a lot of houses .
i thought it &apos;d be nice to bring in a third party
that &apos;s objective , to help settle the fountain dispute .
oh . objective , right .
well , my son does go to school with lily ,
but believe me , that is not gonna sway my decision
any more than the fact that you are beautiful .
thank you . you are , too .
thank you .
let me grab your cans .
your paint cans .
there you go .
so ...
hey , what &apos;s the matter , joe ?
hey , that &apos;s a boy . that &apos;s a boy .
come here . there you go .
here you are . there you go .
there you go .
you know , i &apos;m happy to take him outside until he stops crying .
oh , no , i wouldn &apos;t want you to miss this .
it &apos;s fine . once daniel craig put his shirt back on ,
i lost interest .
are you sure ?
absolutely .
okay .
here--just go ahead . attaboy .
attaboy . thank you very much .
i &apos;ll be right outside .
okay .
shh !
you shush , nathan !
stupid thing !
dad , we &apos;ve been standing here forever .
can &apos;t we just call the guy ?
no . there is no guy . i &apos;m the guy .
here &apos;s what i need you to do . run to the hardware store ,
get me a t6 torx screwdriver .
what ?
just ask the guy .
i thought there was no guy .
there is one there !
could be a girl .
eh ?
just go !
i didn &apos;t need a torx screwdriver .
i &apos;ve always wanted one , though .
but i needed them out of the house ,
so ... i could ... call ... a guy .
dad , help me .
are we gonna do that thing again
where you try on different outfits like in &quot; pretty woman &quot; ?
saw you sinkin &apos; some j &apos;s back there , huh ?
box and one . cover two .
sh @-@ shaq @-@ a @-@ hack ? am i right ?
not even close .
what &apos;s up ?
well , word has it
that you were a pretty good handball player back in the day .
yeah .
and neil armstrong was a &quot; pretty good &quot; trumpet player .
i see you spent a lot more time on the court
than you did in the classroom ,
so clearly , i &apos;ve come to the right place .
look , i need you to teach me everything you know .
how come it &apos;s so important ?
well , there &apos;s this kid ,
and he &apos;s been kind of bullying lily and all her friends .
and i tried to teach him .
i tried to put him in his place on the handball court ,
and i lost .
and i @-@ i could just see the disappointment in lily &apos;s eyes .
like there &apos;s any emotion in those eyes .
are you gonna help me or not ?
okay .
yes !
but i need you to give it 105 % .
ah , no . it &apos;s 110 % , buddy .
that &apos;s impossible .
yes . i think the fountain &apos;s a little pricy .
but you know what ? it &apos;s gonna more than make up for itself
when a family comes in here
and falls head over heels in love with this home .
okay , that &apos;s a valid point .
it is a bit of an empty space out there .
thank you .
well , i mean , i see what you &apos;re saying .
sorry . it &apos;s hot in here , right ?
oh , well , you know , that happens to women of a certain age ,
like with my mom .
are you kidding ? what are you , like , 35 ?
what are you , like , an angel sent from heaven ?
i see what you &apos;re saying .
i just feel that we might be pricing ourselves out of the market .
if a family wants to come in here ,
and--and build themselves a fountain ,
they can do so themselves .
that &apos;s true .
um , okay , well , you know , pam ,
um , there are lots of families like ... ours ...
moving to this neighborhood for the schools .
p.s. , saw connor &apos;s art project--gorgeous .
talent runs in the family .
anyway , i &apos;m just saying i think a family would respond
to having a little drama in the backyard .
i think pam &apos;s made it pretty clear what she likes . am i right ?
oh , no .
now my shirt is all see @-@ through .
and so are you .
please tell me you are not falling for this .
i &apos;m not , but i am enjoying this little show tremendously ,
so thank you .
as for my professional opinion on the fountain ,
don &apos;t do it .
i mean , if you were gonna live here yourself ,
i &apos;d say go for it . but it &apos;s too expensive for a flip .
yeah . yeah .
thank you .
cam ?
fine .
lesbians .
i can &apos;t believe i just went garter shopping with my son .
when you find a better way to keep my socks up ,
let me know .
hey , as long as we &apos;re in the mall ,
you wanna stop in the baby class to see jay and joe ?
no . they need this time to make a connection .
it &apos;s not like mother and son ,
that the bond is naturally strong .
hey , isn &apos;t that joe over there ?
no , that &apos;s some weird baby .
he &apos;s not perfect like my little joe .
but he &apos;s got the same blanket .
gloria . what are you doing here ?
you gave our baby to a stranger ? !
she &apos;s not a stranger . she &apos;s claire &apos;s friend .
shh !
shut up , nathan !
gloria !
the gas is on , dad .
i can see the spark from the igniter .
i don &apos;t know what it is .
that &apos;s your thermocouple .
you get a little sediment in there
or some rust , and you &apos;re done for .
the thermocouple . of course .
why didn &apos;t i think of that ?
thanks , dad . i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t be buggin &apos; you with this stuff .
are you kiddin &apos; me ? i love to help .
makes me feel like you still need me .
of course i need you .
you &apos;re the best when it comes to this .
anything else you need fixin &apos; ?
yeah , actually ,
i &apos;ve been havin &apos; a little trouble with my thumb .
oh , the old thumb . that &apos;s simple .
just push it back in and make that popping sound .
oh , yeah , you &apos;re right .
there you go .
make sure you tell claire how pretty she looks tonight .
a woman needs to hear that .
you do the same with mom .
no , your mom &apos;s a little tired of
hearing how pretty claire is .
good one !
all right . love you .
love you , too .
dad , we &apos;re home .
that was the least fun i have ever had shopping ever .
here .
honey , that &apos;s a torque wrench , not a torx screwdriver .
okay , you &apos;re just screaming now .
can &apos;t you just go get it ? you &apos;re the best at this stuff .
yeah , plus the car is doing something funny ,
and there &apos;s a light on the dashboard
that looks like a little genie lamp .
my kids are helpless , but maybe that &apos;s okay .
because years from now when they have their own houses ,
they &apos;ll call me on their hologram phones
and say , &quot; help me , dad . you &apos;re my only hope . &quot;
and i &apos;ll be the happiest father in sector 7 ...
or sector 12 , if we &apos;re doing really well .
i don &apos;t know why your mom &apos;s so mad .
maybe it has something to do
with giving your son away to a complete stranger .
you &apos;re next .
and what were you two doing in the mall , anyway ?
i thought you were seeing &quot; moby dick . &quot;
it was sold out .
maybe that &apos;s how you can make it up to her--
take me to the &quot; moby dick &quot; reading tomorrow .
nice try .
doing something selfless for her other son
could make up for your monumental blunder .
maybe flowers or jewelry .
i like to throw money at the problem .
hello , pretty lady .
what do you wanna do for dinner ?
how about we exchange the baby for a cheese pizza ?
is this about today ?
i &apos;ll call for those tickets .
you were supposed to spend quality time with the baby .
joe was asleep .
he didn &apos;t even know he missed the puppet show .
it was the baby class !
okay , call it what you want .
i saw a hippie with a frog on his hand .
and for your information ,
i &apos;m takin &apos; manny to that reading tomorrow .
now you &apos;re just trying to dig yourself out of a hole
because you know that you were caught in a lie .
so here &apos;s something ...
not now , manny .
oh , let him talk .
i called the theater ,
and they have tons of tickets for tomorrow &apos;s show .
and it turns out today &apos;s show wasn &apos;t sold out , either .
ay , manny , not now .
let him talk .
mom , why &apos;d you say it was sold out ?
yeah . why &apos;d you say it was sold out ?
it was a mistake . this is not my first language .
i don &apos;t understand english very goodly .
don &apos;t play that card .
you didn &apos;t wanna go any more than i did .
fine . i lied , but i earned that lie .
ay , manny , i am so sorry .
but you know that i am always trying to do everything
for everybody in this family .
but you .
you only do what &apos;s good for you .
let me tell you something , jay pritchett--
when it comes to raising kids ,
you get what you give .
well , you rattled that off pretty goodly .
you don &apos;t have to do this , daddy .
i know , but daddy really wants to do this , okay ?
no , no , no .
no , what do you think you &apos;re doing , sadie ?
no cutsies . come on .
next .
hello , milo .
hello , one of lily &apos;s dads .
all right , let &apos;s make this interesting , okay ?
if i win , the new rule is this , okay ?
no player can play more than three times in a row
without getting back in line
and letting the other kids play .
what if i win ?
then i &apos;ll give you $ 20,000 .
you &apos;re on .
all right . let &apos;s do this .
yes !
one point for me .
one point for me . that &apos;s right .
milo , the wall &apos;s over here .
nah , nah . doesn &apos;t count . it was out .
little too high for you , huh ?
three bounces to the wall , makes you a lo @-@ ser ,
makes you a lo @-@ ser .
final point . i get this , i win .
oh , sweet lord jesus .
whoo ! yes ! yes ! winner !
cham @-@ pi @-@ on ! cham @-@ pi @-@ on !
cam &apos;s gonna be doing drop @-@ offs for a while .
we got a letter .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re both wondering
why i summoned you here tonight .
i now present to you the &quot; wow &quot; factor .
cam ...
i cannot believe that you went rogue .
uncool . i am with claire on this .
you &apos;ll soon see why .
prepare your senses ...
for dancing waters .
wow .
wow .
factor .
now imagine a prospective buyer ,
so entranced by the aqua ballet ,
they &apos;re compelled instantly to make a rich offer .
i &apos;ve even stocked the pools
with fish of gold .
they &apos;re just goldfish ,
but they &apos;re-- they &apos;re right here .
this is ... this is really impressive , cam .
what did you spend ?
quite a bit , actually , but i don &apos;t wanna get into that .
let me turn this up to eleventy @-@ five .
wow .
wow .
factor .
hey , cam , are fish of gold
supposed to swim backwards like that ?
no , not to my knowledge , no .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of like they &apos;re all--
they &apos;re gathering towards that thing .
it &apos;s like a-- oh , no !
they are getting sucked out .
you &apos;re killing them !
claire ! unplug it !
it &apos;s half a fish ! that &apos;s a half a fish !
there are certain queer times and occasions
in this strange , mixed affair we call life ...
when a man takes this whole universe
for a vast practical joke ...
though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns ...
tick @-@ tick @-@ tick , tick @-@ tick @-@ tick @-@ tick ,
goes the dynamite ,
goes the dynamite !
and more than suspects that the joke
is at nobody &apos;s expense but his own .
all right . close your eyes .
why ?
just trust me .
okay .
never close your eyes on the court !
but you told me ...
don &apos;t let me get in your head !
pop &apos; em !
pop &apos; em all before they hit the ground ! go !
i don &apos;t really understand how ...
make a fist with your thumb on the side .
now bring your thumb to the front .
okay , now do it again .
you just spelled &quot; ass &quot; in sign language .
okay . close your eyes .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re off the court .
