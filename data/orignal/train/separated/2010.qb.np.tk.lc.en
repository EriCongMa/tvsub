less than 1 out of every 12 people who applies gets in .
what if i &apos;m not one of those people ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe you &apos;ll get in somewhere else .
i don &apos;t want to go to law school .
i want to go to harvard .
i got 100 % faith in you .
i didn &apos;t get in .
i promised her .
louis , i liked her .
you &apos;re just going to have to tell her the truth .
i want my name on the door .
so if you deliver a huge win ...
i get my name on the door .
are you talking about joining forces with her ?
not just with her , with her firm--
her infinitely deep @-@ pocketed firm .
edward and i are merging .
i had to show him the books .
you don &apos;t want your name on the door .
you want your name on my door .
i want to see our names on the same door .
and this merger isn &apos;t happening .
i won &apos;t .
you will .
harvey will never forgive me .
right now your problem isn &apos;t with harvey .
your problem is with me .
champagne ?
depends .
on what ?
on whether or not there &apos;s a roofie in there .
i wouldn &apos;t need a roofie .
jessica , uh , might i have a private word ?
actually , harvey and i were--
don &apos;t mind me .
my date just got here .
edward .
harvey .
hell of a party .
you look ...
beautiful . i know .
actually , i was going to say &quot; sophisticated . &quot;
no , you weren &apos;t .
i can now .
you seem different .
i feel different .
what &apos;s going on ?
you know , why don &apos;t you get me a drink ?
it &apos;s a party .
okay .
harvey .
rachel .
you look nice .
thank you . so do i.
now i see what you &apos;re always talking about .
what was that supposed to mean ?
what do you think it means ? it means you &apos;re a dick .
fair point .
you bring it ?
right here .
you sure you want to do this to her ?
you &apos;re supposed to be on my side .
i am . i &apos;ve got your back .
then why are you giving me such a hard time about it ?
not only am i not giving you a hard time ,
but i am giving you this ...
and this and this .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
hi , may i--
excuse me , good sir .
would you be so kind as to prepare me ...
a frapin cuvee ?
easy , prince charles .
where i &apos;m from , you wait your turn in line .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry ,
but i thought you &apos;d been served .
the barman is patiently waiting on you ,
so i &apos;d stop standing there like some sort of baboon .
and order your miller lite .
macallan 25 , neat .
why don &apos;t you put a banana in it for my man here ?
with a drink like that , you might as well be in a zoo ,
playing about in the mud .
oh , you wouldn &apos;t know anything about mud .
it &apos;s not for playing . it &apos;s for cleansing .
you mud ?
i &apos;ve taken mud in more places
than your snooty little mind can fathom .
calais .
sedona .
isle of wight .
joshua tree .
dalyan .
baden @-@ baden .
that isn &apos;t mud . it &apos;s wet dirt .
you know , i don &apos;t know who you think you are--
my moniker is nigel alexander nesbitt .
well , nigel , when you impugn
the life @-@ affirming muds of baden @-@ baden ,
you &apos;re on the precipice of the equivalent
of someone taking a shit on the royal muds of england .
ah , harvey .
i was hoping we might have a moment alone .
so was i.
i wanted to run something by you .
this is a lawsuit .
three lawsuits .
what have i gotten up to now ?
not you , your clients .
looks like one of their hobbies is fixing prices .
i take it this means
you &apos;ve discovered we &apos;re in merger talks ?
and what are you going to do about it ?
what would you have me do ?
i &apos;d have you kiss my ass .
tempting .
however , what i can do is proceed to make you permanently regret
the hostile action you &apos;ve just set in motion .
what , are you going to kill me ?
nonsense .
i &apos;ll simply do what i &apos;ve done to so many before .
i &apos;ll defeat you in open court .
the way i work , it &apos;s never going to get to open court .
you &apos;ll be on your steamer back to london ,
wondering what happened , and you &apos;ll know
that you picked a fight with the wrong guy .
are you suggesting a wager ?
you lose , we don &apos;t merge .
i &apos;ve heard your terms . you win , i go .
care to hear mine ?
don &apos;t need to
&apos;cause you &apos;re never going to win .
well , it looks like you two are getting along .
harvey ...
look at what they can give us .
how do you know what they can give us ?
because he showed me their books .
why did he do that ?
because i showed him ours .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
we needed their help .
you don &apos;t marry someone just because they knock you up .
all right , harvey , here it is .
you lose ,
you embrace this partnership with no reservations .
he can beat me ,
i &apos;ll welcome him with arms wide open .
he can &apos;t , we send him back to england ,
and he can spend his time fixing his teeth .
fine .
you beat edward , we don &apos;t do this .
and since you didn &apos;t want to hear darby &apos;s terms ,
these are mine .
you win , you get what you want .
you lose , you stay ,
you extend your noncompete ,
and you get a chance to earn your name on the door
because it &apos;s not going up there now .
get in the car .
i prefer to walk .
since when ?
doctor recommended it .
helps me work out the kinks since i got stabbed in the back .
you ?
last night was a personal attack on me .
oh , that &apos;s funny because jessica seemed to think
it was a personal attack on her ,
yet both of you knew about the merger
and chose not to tell me .
you should get lunch--seems like you have a lot in common .
harvey . harvey .
can you stop being so defensive for one second ?
you put me on the defensive .
and i &apos;m not just going to stand here and listen to you
because i went on the attack .
harvey--
no , don &apos;t &quot; harvey &quot; me , okay ?
you made your bed ,
and now you &apos;re going to sleep in it alone .
what did i do that was so terrible ?
for the past nine months , i have been fending off attacks
from daniel hardman , allison holt , and robert zane .
i told you before .
you want to get your name on the door ,
get it at your own goddamn firm .
okay . fine .
if it &apos;s not personal ,
you &apos;re not going to hold it against me
when we beat you .
0 and everything , scottie .
that &apos;s your record against me--
0 and everything .
hey .
hey .
i never got to buy you that drink last night .
they were free .
i know .
you left .
i did .
it was a nice party .
it was .
okay , so i see you &apos;re still not going to tell me why--
i didn &apos;t get into harvard .
don &apos;t look at me that way .
with sympathy ?
with pity .
i wasn &apos;t . rachel ...
listen to me . there are other schools .
don &apos;t .
yeah . i won &apos;t .
it wasn &apos;t that i wasn &apos;t good enough .
i know that .
it was louis .
what ?
the interviewer--
um , apparently she and louis had a history , and--
wait . she didn &apos;t let you in because of him ?
that &apos;s ...
i know .
not right .
i know .
tell me about the day you found out .
rachel , come on .
no .
i need to hear how it felt from someone who got in
because i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll never hear that for myself .
you &apos;re looking at me like that again .
i &apos;m not .
then what ?
it &apos;s just not right .
it was a pleasure meeting you .
what the hell was that ?
what was what ?
what were you doing with donna ?
i was caressing her lovely hand
with my lovely lips .
you know what i mean .
what are you doing here ?
oh , that . i was being treated to a tour of your little outpost .
i &apos;ll grant you this ,
you &apos;ve got quite the spectacular view ...
though truth be told ,
my favorite spot was inside ms. paulsen &apos;s cubicle .
how could you ?
how could i what ?
don &apos;t .
you let that man inside your cubicle .
inside my what ?
nigel nesbitt-- i mean , you let him ...
i have never crossed the boundary of your cubicle .
and should that honor ever be bestowed on me ,
at least i &apos;d be gentleman enough to keep it between us .
i mean , i have too much respect for you .
louis , he leaned over to get a file .
he &apos;s doing an efficiency list .
oh , thank god .
wait a second . i &apos;ve been asked to do an efficiency list .
so do one .
no , you don &apos;t get it .
it &apos;s inefficient to have two people doing efficiency lists .
it &apos;s a test .
to see who &apos;s better .
how dare they ?
man , you know , it &apos;s bad enough
that smug bastard thinks
he &apos;s higher up on the mud chain than me .
is he ?
again ?
didn &apos;t you tell him about cartagena ?
i was on tilt after he nullified baden @-@ baden .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i let him out @-@ mud me .
what am i going to do ?
okay , i &apos;m going to tell you exactly what you &apos;re going to do .
you &apos;re going to pull your shit together ,
and you &apos;re going to kick his limey ass .
you &apos;re goddamn right .
uh , can i help you ?
no , no . i &apos;m fine .
just had a mochaccino . waiting to see harvey .
he &apos;s making you wait ?
oh , i don &apos;t actually believe he &apos;s aware i &apos;m here .
so why don &apos;t you go in ?
well , his secretary isn &apos;t present to announce me .
it wouldn &apos;t be proper .
what year is it ?
mike ?
yeah ?
what &apos;s going on out there ?
um , it &apos;s kind of hard to explain .
have you ever seen downton abbey ?
what ?
i haven &apos;t caught it , but i &apos;ve heard great things .
yeah , it &apos;s terrific .
really ?
yeah .
may i present mr. edward darby of--
get the hell out of here .
okay .
oh , i &apos;ll netflix it .
you should .
i don &apos;t mean to pry ,
but is that how you treat all your underlings ?
listen , benny hill ,
i &apos;m a little busy
preparing a motion to kick your ass .
you mind getting to the point ?
well , that is the point .
you may have to expedite that motion a little faster than you think .
tomorrow i &apos;ll be freezing your assets .
let me get this straight .
you &apos;re coming in here to warn me
that you &apos;re going to freeze my client &apos;s assets ?
of course .
this way , you &apos;ll have time
to transfer a bit of currency to fund your legal battle .
it wouldn &apos;t be sporting , otherwise .
&quot; sporting &quot; ?
certainly .
one doesn &apos;t hunt the fox while it &apos;s still in its den .
one sounds the horn
and allows the poor creature a head start
before giving chase .
you think i &apos;m the fox ?
think it ?
the only one who doesn &apos;t know that is you .
you and me ...
right now ...
game of efficiency list .
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t have my files with me .
files are for pussies .
right you are .
i begin with life expectancy .
i begin with nutrition .
how do you think i determine life expectancy ?
number of sexual partners .
relationship to mother .
pet ownership .
the three things are inextricably linked ,
and i have the formula right here .
yeah , well , i ...
just remembered that i have a deposition
that i have to go to in conference room &quot; d. &quot;
there is no conference room &quot; d. &quot;
they &apos;re re @-@ lettering .
where are you off to in such a hurry ?
uh , i have to finish this page @-@ turner .
harry potter ?
no , but it is by a british author .
well , i &apos;ve got something else for you to read .
what ?
a letter .
oh , sweet . it &apos;s not even my birthday .
it &apos;s not to you . it &apos;s from you .
this is to harvard .
i &apos;m going over sheila sazs &apos; head
and telling them everything that happened .
well , you are .
rachel , you can &apos;t--
no , come on .
you said it yourself .
it is not right that i &apos;m being denied admission
because someone &apos;s punishing louis .
it &apos;s not , but i can &apos;t sign this .
why not ?
it &apos;s hearsay .
mike , i &apos;m someone who wants to go to harvard .
you &apos;re someone who went to harvard .
who do you think they &apos;re going to listen to more ?
are you going to help me or not ?
i &apos;ll help you .
whatever it is , i &apos;m not in the mood .
i know about rachel and sheila and harvard .
how ?
rachel told me .
she wants me to send this letter going over sheila &apos;s head ,
but it can &apos;t come from me .
yeah , it can &apos;t come from anyone .
she didn &apos;t get in
because they didn &apos;t think she was good enough .
you lied to her .
no , i never lied to her .
i told her she was good enough , which she is ,
but i let her down because i couldn &apos;t persuade sheila ,
which is the truth .
louis , you have to tell her the real truth .
mike , i saw the look on her face ,
and i took it away .
i do not want to put it back .
you &apos;ll regret it .
look , i &apos;ll give you another day to think about it ,
but after that , i have to tell her myself .
gentlemen , i &apos;m glad you stopped by .
i wanted to inform you
i &apos;m leaving town on the morrow .
i &apos;ll be having my number two handle the case for me .
i expect you &apos;ll do the same .
why would i do that ?
it &apos;s tradition . i leave it to you .
honor it or don &apos;t .
i say we honor it .
oh , by the by , downton abbey--
got it in my briefcase .
plan to watch it on the plane .
oh , my god . you are going to--
please , please . i abhor spoilers .
episode three-- that &apos;s all i &apos;ll say .
why don &apos;t you two watch it together
over a game of tiddlywinks ?
you seem to be upset over my game
of &quot; let &apos;s put the peacock in its place . &quot;
i &apos;m glad you mentioned that .
i brought a little going @-@ away present for you .
this is a biscuit and a bottle of water .
it &apos;s what i assume they serve in english prison ,
which is where your client &apos;s going
for freezing our client &apos;s assets .
it &apos;s a violation of international law
to intimidate a litigant into settling
by choking their funding .
you seem to think you &apos;ve got me by the short hairs .
however , if you turn to page 693 in this tome ,
you &apos;ll find an exception to that very law .
no , i won &apos;t .
i &apos;ve memorized this book .
yes , i was told of your prowess ,
which is why i chose a law not published in any book ,
but a long @-@ standing provision honored in england for decades .
we can do what we like , as long as notice is given .
you don &apos;t give a shit about being sporting .
you just wanted to skirt the law .
nonsense . i wanted to do both .
by filing this action ,
you have opened your clients up
to a charge of malicious litigation .
which is why you froze the assets in the first place .
you baited us .
in any case , you seem to be backed up against the wall .
i &apos;m comfortable there .
gives me back support for when i come out swinging .
well , you &apos;d better do something quickly .
your clients don &apos;t have the funds
to proceed beyond , i &apos;d say , this week &apos;s end .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
hey , can i , uh , talk to you for a sec ?
what is it , louis ? i &apos;m just a little busy now .
i just wanted to say that i know you &apos;ve been taking
a lot of heat from jessica , and ...
i &apos;m glad you did what you did .
that &apos;s not supposed to be public knowledge .
well , no , donna told me
because she knows that i support you 100 % .
do you ?
nigel nesbitt-- my british counterpart .
what about him ?
he out @-@ mudded me .
didn &apos;t you tell him about cartagena ?
oh , would we be having this conversation if i had ?
louis , relax .
i know how seriously you take your mudding ,
but that &apos;s personal .
it doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s a better lawyer .
yeah , but he didn &apos;t just out @-@ mud me , harvey .
he out @-@ listed me . he out @-@ educated me .
he ...
out @-@ me &apos;d me .
harvey , i &apos;m scared .
please tell me we &apos;re going to win this thing .
our backs are against the wall .
what do you need ?
right now i need to buy some time .
that &apos;s easy .
what ?
you once told me what to do
when your back &apos;s against the wall .
break the goddamn thing down .
that &apos;s right .
you have access to that shit ?
all of it .
they needed me to do an efficiency list .
we got &apos; em .
you &apos;re not mr. chong &apos;s chinese food .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s what you &apos;re going to use
against scottie tomorrow morning .
me ?
you &apos;re going in as number two .
i don &apos;t want to give edward any excuses .
you mean you don &apos;t want to deal with scottie .
well , that &apos;s just a side benefit .
right .
whoa , wait a second .
this is confidential information from the merger .
which you &apos;re going to use to get us a reprieve .
you broke the chinese wall ?
why do you think i &apos;m here ?
harvey , this is inadmissible stuff .
and it &apos;s in the ballpark
of what tanner accused you of with coastal motors .
but it &apos;s the only way i see us
getting a little breathing room ,
and i &apos;d rather cross my own line
than sign their dotted one .
okay .
then it looks like i have a date
with your girlfriend in the morning .
weren &apos;t you supposed to be announced ?
i don &apos;t play by those rules .
somehow that doesn &apos;t surprise me .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re not scottie .
and you &apos;re not jimmy smits , but we make do .
are you making l.a. law reference ?
no , i &apos;m saying i wish i had a date with jimmy smits .
ah .
but instead i &apos;m here ...
to tell you that edward &apos;s in another league .
you &apos;re going to lose .
well , there &apos;s only one problem .
words are coming out of your mouth ,
which means the real story isn &apos;t .
okay , you want the real story ?
your clients are running out of funds .
you have a window .
to do what ?
give up .
no , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to cut it for us .
why not ?
because ...
we have this .
harvey , we still have to work together after this .
i am giving you a way out .
we can still both be name partners .
no , we can &apos;t .
i made a deal with jessica .
i win , you &apos;re out .
i give up ,
you &apos;re going to be name partner all by yourself .
that &apos;s not what i want .
harvey , don &apos;t you get it ?
wait a second .
if you &apos;re here , who the hell &apos;s in with mike ?
get out .
you &apos;re angry .
this isn &apos;t funny , harvey . you just broke the law .
it &apos;s a civil law . no one &apos;s going to go to jail .
justify it all you want , but you cheated .
like you , subbing in for scottie ?
i see what you &apos;re doing .
you know damn well darby plays by the rules .
so if you win by cheating , you win .
and if you lose , then they think you &apos;re dirty ,
and they won &apos;t want to merge .
you really want to merge with a man
who &apos;s asking for your help to win ?
he didn &apos;t ask .
i insisted .
on being his number two .
i guess that &apos;s a preview of things to come .
and is that little stunt you pulled
a preview of things to come ?
holt , zane , hardman .
we just fought them off .
we won . we &apos;re strong . we &apos;ve got money .
and if we do this , we go to the next level .
we &apos;ll be the biggest , baddest fish in the sea .
and what &apos;s going to happen after i beat darby ?
you think i &apos;m playing with you ?
that stunt you pulled-- fruit from the poison tree .
i will have that reversed on tuesday .
you think i &apos;m not going to find anything
between now and tuesday ?
i know you won &apos;t .
is that a threat ?
it &apos;s a prediction .
i can go .
where you going to go ?
even if i let you out ,
it &apos;s the same out there , only worse .
and you &apos;ll be a winner , but not a leader ,
and you won &apos;t have me .
you don &apos;t know these people .
i know they said i couldn &apos;t control you .
you &apos;re going to learn that i can .
the merger hasn &apos;t gone through yet ,
so technically ,
you &apos;re not allowed to be lurking around our files .
i &apos;m not lurking . i &apos;m looking for you .
and here i am .
i think that you lied to me .
i think that you &apos;re wrong .
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m talking about .
i know i &apos;m not a liar .
you told me you never said a bad thing about me .
and i never have .
but you don &apos;t like me .
i don &apos;t like people who lie to harvey .
are you in love with him , donna ?
i am so frickin &apos; tired of people asking me that ,
and it is none of your business .
but , no .
and i did like you ,
until you walked in here with that bullshit agenda and--
it &apos;s not bullshit .
okay , then what would you call it ?
why do you think i came back last time ?
why do you think i brought us in on folsom ?
i don &apos;t know how to get his attention
unless i sue him .
you &apos;re in love with him .
he &apos;s-- he &apos;s just so angry at me ,
and i @-@ i don &apos;t know how to make him believe it .
well , why would he believe you ?
all you &apos;ve ever done is lie to him .
this is not ...
this is not a lie .
look , dana , if you want to break through his anger ,
you &apos;re going to have to do something .
the merger .
walk away .
from my name on the door .
if you want him to hear you ,
you &apos;re going to have to make a sacrifice .
so i just ...
risk everything with no guarantee .
that &apos;s what sacrifice is .
i got your message .
why are we meeting here ?
you sound like you don &apos;t trust me .
well , you did sandbag me with jessica .
jessica sandbagged you with jessica .
still doesn &apos;t explain why we &apos;re meeting here .
baby harvey .
that &apos;s a huge compliment .
call it like i see it .
i meant for him .
we &apos;re meeting here because you
will never find this .
if this checks out , it &apos;ll win the case for us .
i know .
and why am i the one you &apos;re giving this to ?
when we were in law school ,
harvey &apos;s brother got sick .
he needed money . his father didn &apos;t have any .
his mother wasn &apos;t in the picture .
don &apos;t tell me .
harvey found a way to help him out .
he used his tuition .
anyway ...
when his mother found out , she contacted him .
harvey wouldn &apos;t take a nickel from her .
so she gave his brother the money .
who used it to pay him back .
i didn &apos;t even know harvey had a brother .
you &apos;d like him .
he &apos;s like you .
so are you saying that i have to tell harvey
i found this on my own ?
you don &apos;t have to .
but it &apos;ll definitely increase your odds of him using it .
i found something .
let me see .
it &apos;s not done . we have to hurry .
but i can get it done before tomorrow morning .
this is good .
i know .
get on it . where &apos;d you get it ?
you know where i got it .
the question is , are you going to let me use it ?
get out .
harvey , we can win with this .
here &apos;s what you don &apos;t get . you can &apos;t trust her .
if it came from her ,
it &apos;ll come back to bite us in the ass .
tomorrow morning is coming , and we don &apos;t have anything else .
then go find me something .
okay .
pardon me . excuse me .
do you mind if i have a little more lemon ?
thanks .
you were at the show ?
seat 4 @-@ a . you ?
seat a @-@ 4 . shakespeare well performed .
indeed ...
though not improved
by the yammering of that battle axe .
well , thank god she stopped after the first act .
thank you .
well , she didn &apos;t precisely stop .
you had her removed ?
told her the baby @-@ sitter phoned ,
and the children were on fire .
what &apos;s that ?
one row up-- some douche bag was texting .
took it from him , didn &apos;t even know .
oh , uh , please .
incidentally , excellent use of the word &quot; douche bag . &quot;
well , i &apos;ve had a lot of experience with them .
as have i.
i don &apos;t make friends very easily .
that &apos;s funny . when i was a kid ...
there was a bunch of them .
most of them were just followers ,
but there was that one-- kirk breslin .
julian hunt .
and then one day i decided to be mean .
i just told that bully piece of shit
that he &apos;d never be anything , do anything ,
or amount to anything .
after that , they never made fun of me again .
right .
i shouldn &apos;t have impugned baden @-@ baden .
it &apos;s just that when i asked you if you took mud ,
i was ...
offering a warm , muddied hand of friendship ,
and you took that hand and wiped it clean .
well , i didn &apos;t recognize the gesture .
i understand .
it &apos;s a lonely job , being the hatchet man .
yeah , well , i guess it &apos;s , uh , our cross to bear .
can i be honest with you ?
with the results of my efficiency list ,
i keep arriving at the same conclusion .
there &apos;s no room for both of us .
unless ...
we made room for each other .
i leave you off my list .
and i leave you off mine .
well , would you be willing
to sacrifice the integrity of your list ?
i would ...
for a friend .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i have a feeling you &apos;re about to tell me .
are you for this merger or against it ?
i &apos;m against it .
why ? never mind .
i &apos;m going to tell you why--
because of scottie .
if i can &apos;t trust her ,
how can i trust any of it ?
she &apos;s showing you you can by throwing it all away .
that folder is a wild @-@ goose chase .
oh , my god . for somebody who &apos;s usually three steps ahead ,
you are a mile behind .
she is in love with you , harvey ...
only she can &apos;t tell you that .
because she , like everybody else ,
knows that it will only drive you away .
donna .
if she had shown up here
and asked you to start a relationship ,
would you have said yes ?
no , you wouldn &apos;t have .
it &apos;s not that simple .
was it not that simple with zoe ?
what the hell does that have to do with it ?
you let her go .
she left me to raise her niece .
did you ask her to stay ?
it wasn &apos;t on the table .
she wanted you to fight .
that poor girl was losing her father ,
and i wasn &apos;t about to try and replace him
while it was happening .
bullshit ! you let her go !
and i am so sick of watching you fight like hell
for everything that happens in here
and nothing that happens in here .
is this about zoe ?
no .
is this about you ?
no .
this is about scottie .
you don &apos;t know what she did .
i do know what she did .
she cheated on her fiance , so you think that that means
that there will always be a chance
that she will cheat on you .
the difference is , she didn &apos;t love him .
she loves you .
look , i know that your mother hurt you ,
but you need to get over it .
you think that &apos;s what i &apos;m worried about ?
she made me make a fool out of him ,
a man i &apos;d never met ,
a man who &apos;d never done a wrong to me .
how am i going to trust someone
who made me a man who did that ?
maybe you can &apos;t trust her .
but if you want to end this merger ,
you better trust what she gave mike .
give him the file .
what do you think i did four hours ago ?
you wanted to see me ?
that request went out two hours ago .
uh , yeah , i was in the middle of something .
what were you in the middle of ?
excuse me ?
you said you were in the middle of something .
i assume it &apos;s harvey &apos;s case .
i can &apos;t tell you that . you &apos;re on the other side .
is there some rule
against my checking on my own employee ?
i &apos;m confident that , after tomorrow ,
you &apos;ll either settle or lose .
and why is that ?
because i &apos;ve prepared a motion
based on a file dated september 14th .
darby didn &apos;t tell me about that .
he didn &apos;t know about it .
where &apos;d you get it ?
what does it say ?
it says you &apos;re going to lose .
then that &apos;s too bad ...
because you &apos;re going to throw it away .
what ?
you heard me .
you &apos;re going to go home .
you don &apos;t call , you don &apos;t answer ,
and you don &apos;t come back until that deadline is passed .
wait a minute . these are your clients .
who harvey is using .
that &apos;s a bullshit argument .
and so is that file .
i won &apos;t .
you will .
harvey will never forgive me .
right now your problem isn &apos;t with harvey .
your problem is with me .
you don &apos;t do this ,
who &apos;s to say you don &apos;t end up in a cell
for practicing law without a degree ?
and who &apos;s to say you don &apos;t share that cell with me
for knowing about it the whole time ?
you don &apos;t want to take that tact .
i didn &apos;t start it .
i will beat you .
the last time you said that to me ,
you thought you didn &apos;t need a computer .
you were wrong .
that was about demonstrating knowledge ,
and the stakes were nothing .
this is about my power ,
and the stakes are everything .
this is a letter to the district attorney ,
saying that it &apos;s come to my attention
that you are breaking the law .
i believe you &apos;ve met him--
not the type to let it slide .
you file your motion ...
i &apos;ll file mine .
okay , look , harvey--
shut your mouth !
i risked everything for you .
then i did it again and again .
wait . you weren &apos;t there .
i didn &apos;t have to be .
jessica--
you don &apos;t work for jessica .
you work for me .
i know i do ,
but i was just trying to get you what you wanted--
your name on the door .
no , you got edward darby &apos;s name on the door .
my part of the deal is gone .
what ? you never told me that .
i didn &apos;t think i needed to tell you that
because i didn &apos;t think you would ever betray me .
harvey , look at what we &apos;ve done--
you and me .
you broke the chinese wall .
i got information directly from scottie .
that &apos;s two ethical violations that six weeks ago
would have made your stomach turn .
that &apos;s not why you did it .
fine .
but look me in the eye and tell me it &apos;s not true anyway .
you know what , it doesn &apos;t matter
because you don &apos;t get to make my decisions for me .
isn &apos;t that what you were trying to do for me ?
this is a private conversation .
you want to have it out , let &apos;s have it out ...
right now .
you might want to go .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re back in the associates &apos; pool .
harvey , come on .
turns out you &apos;re not the best lawyer i &apos;ve ever seen .
in fact , you &apos;re fired .
no , he &apos;s not .
oh , you going to overrule me on that too ?
you can go .
i didn &apos;t overrule you on the other .
i beat you fair and square .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re right .
i cheated , like you .
you jumped to the other side .
you put me on the other side .
i had a deal
that put your name right next to mine .
and it wasn &apos;t even up there yet ,
and you started acting like it was on top of mine .
to protect you .
bullshit .
this wasn &apos;t about protecting me .
this was about advancing you .
that &apos;s what this whole thing is about .
what ?
hardman said it . i didn &apos;t think it was true .
he said you don &apos;t trust me .
he meant you &apos;re afraid of me .
afraid of you ?
boy , i just kicked your ass .
and you didn &apos;t just want it .
you begged me for it .
so now you &apos;re going to stay here ,
be humble ,
and learn your goddamn place .
and then we just toasted to it ,
one hatchet man to the other .
wow , louis .
that &apos;s the sweetest story i &apos;ve ever heard .
i broke my word .
what ?
i put him on the list , and i handed it in .
how could you do that ?
i realized i couldn &apos;t do that to my list .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to live with myself ,
which means he couldn &apos;t either .
he didn &apos;t put you on his list .
i have to do something .
you can &apos;t . it &apos;s too late .
not that .
i couldn &apos;t be a good friend to nigel ,
but i could &apos;ve been a good friend to rachel , and i wasn &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
i missed the deadline to tell her something ,
but i can still try to make it right .
i &apos;m a man of my word .
and what word is that ?
i &apos;m here to officially welcome you to the firm
with open arms .
i &apos;m not much of a hugger .
good .
one more thing-- jessica was wrong .
scottie didn &apos;t give me anything .
i took it .
what would you have me do ?
give her her job back .
what reason would i have to do that ?
whatever she did ,
you wouldn &apos;t have this merger without her .
fair enough .
would you have her work here or in london ?
rachel , look , i &apos;m sorry , but i am not--
when did you send that letter ?
um , i was , uh--
i &apos;ll tell you when-- never .
okay , look , let me explain .
when i went to see louis ,
he told me what really happened--
i know . he told me too .
and i get it . i &apos;m not good enough .
what i don &apos;t get , mike , is why you didn &apos;t have the courage
to just come and tell me that yourself .
look , he lied to you .
i thought he deserved a chance to tell you himself , all right ?
when i went to his office to get him to sign the letter--
wait .
you went to him to sign the letter ?
you told me you were going to sign the letter .
no--
no , so you lied to me .
no , i didn &apos;t . i told you that i would help you .
that is such bullshit !
that &apos;s not what you meant , and you know it .
you &apos;ve been cagey with me
since the second i came to you about the letter ,
and you &apos;re being cagey with me right now .
you are . you &apos;re lying to me .
not today , rachel .
please , stop .
then what day , mike ?
because it &apos;s always something .
it is always some secret or some story or some lie--
you don &apos;t understand--
i don &apos;t understand what ?
you don &apos;t understand what i have been through !
you don &apos;t understand what i have lost !
because it &apos;s everything , everyone that i love--
trevor , my grandmother , harvey ,
now , probably this job !
i am not ready to lose you ...
not today !
then tell me .
i never went to harvard .
what ?
i &apos;m a fraud .
rachel , i--
