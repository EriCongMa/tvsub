第三季 第二十一集
what &apos;s going on ?
i thought wilden got ali pregnant and killed her .
so is it true ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s true .
wilden &apos;s sure going out of his way to deny it .
either you shut hanna up , or i will !
is everything okay ?
my mom owns maggie &apos;s condo , and she &apos;s selling it .
what ?
do you still have any friends , spencer ?
you are not taking away any more of them .
who &apos;s looking cray @-@ cray now ?
stop !
where is wilden ?
i don &apos;t know .
what happened ?
can you call hanna and emily ?
why ?
i know who &apos;s helping mona .
oh , my god . are you all right ?
yeah . thank god aria got here when she did .
where &apos;s hanna ?
i don &apos;t know .
she won &apos;t answer any of my texts or calls .
so , who is it ? who &apos;s helping mona ?
we should wait for hanna .
no , this is too important to wait .
okay , but you guys need to know that
i &apos;ve been warned not to tell you .
what else is new ?
wait minute .
you knew who it was before tonight ?
yeah . i &apos;ve known for a few weeks .
why didn &apos;t you tell us any sooner ?
i wanted to be sure .
i didn &apos;t want to believe that it could be true ,
but after tonight happened ,
i can &apos;t keep this to myself anymore .
toby is &quot; a. &quot;
he must have been taken to a hospital .
or he &apos;s in the woods somewhere and we just can &apos;t find him .
what are you doing ?
calling rosewood hospital ...
and then my lawyer .
no ! you cannot do that !
why not ?
because if wilden is still alive somewhere ,
we don &apos;t know what he &apos;ll say or do .
hanna , i hit a man .
not just any man-- i hit a cop .
he was threatening you .
i left the scene of an accident .
which is why you can &apos;t admit to what you &apos;ve done
until we know exactly what we &apos;re dealing with .
i was scared . he was reaching for his gun .
i @-@ i thought he was reaching for his gun !
i know . but whatever he did or didn &apos;t do ,
you still hit him .
and once you tell the police or your lawyer ,
there &apos;s no going back .
okay . hanna ...
until we know what our next step is ...
not a word about this to your friends .
understood ?
yes , of course .
hanna , i mean it .
nothing .
i promise .
so , what are we saying ?
that what ali wrote in emily &apos;s notebook was true ?
that toby &apos;s secretly hated us ever since
ali threw that firecracker in his garage ?
yeah , i guess so .
and the whole time that you two ... were together ,
he was just pretending .
okay , we all know how much toby loves you .
this can &apos;t be true . there has to be more to the story .
if he loved me , he would not have let me sit outside of his loft
bawling my eyes out for hours .
okay ? he wouldn &apos;t have taken everything
out of &quot; a &quot; &apos; s lair when he knew that i had the key .
he wouldn &apos;t be trying to hurt me--us !
i am so sorry , spence .
mona must have something over him .
trust me , i have tried to come up with
every possible explanation as to why he could be doing this ,
and it all leads back to the same conclusion .
toby , i know , what would never do anything to hurt any of us .
what &apos;s so funny ?
you . you trying to make sense of this .
you need to stop thinking about toby
as the person that you thought you knew
and start looking at him for who he really is .
and how do i do that ?
you look at the facts , emily !
okay . which are ?
mona is with the decathlon team in new york city .
she couldnhave locked me in the steam room ,
and that leaves toby .
the quicker you wrap your mind around this , the better .
toby , it &apos;s emily .
i really want to talk to you .
i need to talk to you .
please call me back .
hey , babe .
hello .
hi there !
i &apos;m guessing you didn &apos;t get my voicemail .
huh . i just called a seven @-@ year @-@ old &quot; babe . &quot;
so ... malcolm .
this ... is aria .
nice to meet you .
it is so nice to meet you too , malcolm .
tell you what . why don &apos;t you go sort out those cars ?
they &apos;re looking pretty jumbled over there .
when did all this happen ?
i talked to you like ten hours ago .
maggie and malcolm came up this morning .
it was kind of a spur of the moment decision .
for how long ?
ah , a few days .
since they &apos;re getting displaced ,
maggie thought she &apos;d put some feelers out in the area for a job .
and then if she finds one , she thinks moving to rosewood
might be the best thing for everyone .
they &apos;re--they &apos;re gonna be staying here ?
oh , no , no . maggie &apos;s dropping her bags off at a hotel right now .
oh , good .
i ... just mean that your
place is a little small for the three of you .
yeah .
malcolm and i were just about to put the last of the tracks down .
oh , i can go . i &apos;m sure that
you want to spend some alone @-@ time with him .
well , actually , i was ...
i was hoping you could hang out for a little bit ?
get to know malcolm ?
i ... can &apos;t imagine that maggie would be too happy about that .
aria , maggie knows exactly who you are in my life .
believe me , she &apos;s fine with you being here .
what do you say ?
come on ! you gotta check out my train set !
okay !
toby &apos;s clothes and books are still up there .
it &apos;s like he ran out and never looked back .
did you find anything ?
hello ? earth to hanna !
since when do you watch the news ?
what ?
oh . no . uh--
i was just--i wanted to check the weather .
what the hell are you doing ? you &apos;re supposed to be helping me !
look , i looked !
i didn &apos;t find anything .
really ? &apos; cause i coulda sworn
you were sitting in that exact spot 20 minutes ago .
okay , maybe i didn &apos;t try hard enough .
but the more i think about it ,
the more i think we should stop searching for him .
if spencer &apos;s right , toby is dangerous .
if he &apos;s so dangerous , then how come he &apos;s never hurt any of us ?
i &apos;ve been alone with him how many times now ?
no more than i &apos;ve been alone with mona .
wait . did you forget that he tried to kill spencer last night ?
she believes he tried to kill her . she didn &apos;t see him .
she saw him in her kitchen dressed in a black hoodie .
that doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s physically trying to harm any of us .
lucas was blackmailed into doing things for mona , remember ?
we still don &apos;t know what part toby is playing in all this .
we told each other everything .
he gave me the courage to come out .
i gave this to him for his birthday last year .
what &apos;s that ?
parking pass .
who &apos;s &quot; e. lamb &quot; ?
spencer said that &apos;s what toby called himself
to get in and out of radley .
look , if you really want to find him ,
why don &apos;t you just start by talking to his parents ?
perfect .
all aboard !
next stop , union station .
hi , sweetie !
hi , mommy !
oh ! i missed you .
are you having so much fun ?
aria &apos;s the conductor !
well , i bet she &apos;s a good one .
hey , malcolm ,
why don &apos;t we wash up before we eat , yeah ?
maggie .
um ... how are you ?
i &apos;m good , thanks . you ?
good .
great .
look , i just wanted you to know
that it wasn &apos;t me that told ezra about malcolm .
aria , it &apos;s okay .
as much as i wanted ezra to know about him ,
i would never do that .
really , i &apos;m not upset .
to be honest , seeing the way
that ezra and malcolm have bonded over the past few weeks ,
i wish i had told him sooner .
all right , let &apos;s go get this .
um , hey , i spoke to janet ,
and she thinks that she might have a lead on a job .
i was gonna grab coffee with her at four .
oh . um , i &apos;m tutoring then .
can you push it back an hour ?
it &apos;s the only time she &apos;s free today .
i @-@ i can try and find somebody to watch malcolm , or i could--
i can watch him .
uh--i mean-- you don &apos;t have to do that .
really . no , it &apos;s no problem .
it &apos;ll be a lot of fun .
thank you . that &apos;s a big help .
i told you i was warned ,
if i ratted out &quot; t , &quot; &quot; a &quot; was gonna take one of my three .
she &apos;s just trying to scare us .
well , it &apos;s working .
you need to stop looking for toby . just let it go .
you &apos;re looking for toby ? why ?
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t believe what you saw , okay ?
but he &apos;s my friend too , so i need to hear this from him .
okay , i understand that , but i looked for him for weeks .
trust me , he doesn &apos;t want to be found .
thank you .
how long has she been standing there ?
spencer , wait . what are you doing ?
hello . you &apos;re not planning on choking me again , are you ?
no . i just wanted to say thank you for the flowers .
the orchids are especially beautiful .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
might be time to visit your doctor friend again .
listen to me , mona . i &apos;m not playing around .
do not hurt my friends .
if you so much as touch one hair on their heads ,
i will make you very sorry .
am i clear ?
looks like someone &apos;s been skipping their anger management class .
i think i &apos;ll take my pumpkin latte ...
to go .
but a little tip on the orchids .
make sure not to leave them in direct sunlight .
i did once ; they didn &apos;t make it through the night .
i can &apos;t believe your dad kept all that stuff .
what are you doing here ?
i was just picking up some old tax receipts .
what &apos;s with the trip down memory lane ?
oh , this ? i just--
emily started baby @-@ sitting , and so she was wondering
if i had anything that would keep a little boy occupied .
emily ? i thought she was working at the brew .
did i say emily ?
i @-@ i meant hanna .
um , ezra called and left me a message .
he wanted to know if i knew of any open teaching positions
for his friend named maggie . do you know her ?
no . i &apos;ve never met her .
oh . well , i &apos;ll call him and tell him i &apos;ll keep my ears open .
i can tell him .
well , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m gonna see him later and he &apos;s busy now tutoring ,
so he won &apos;t pick up if you call .
is everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , everything &apos;s perfect .
all right , well , i &apos;m gonna go .
i gotta get this stuff to hanna .
aria .
you forgot your ball .
thanks . bye .
hey ... are you a friend of toby &apos;s ?
i work with him .
do you know where he is right now ?
i haven &apos;t seen him in a couple of weeks .
he had some sort of emergency , left me his truck
and asked me to finish a job for him .
did he say where he was going ?
sorry . i &apos;m just here to pick up a table saw .
yeah , there &apos;s nothing in the papers either .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to think .
all right , hanna , i need to get back to work .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
what am i supposed to be looking at ?
notice how all the letterspposed
are shiny except for the &quot; e &quot; and the &quot; m &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know how i missed it this morning ,
but i saw it when i got home .
so what ?
so mona is trying to tell us in her cryptic way
that she &apos;s targeting you next .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a coincidence .
there are no coincidences with &quot; a. &quot;
spence , you &apos;ve been through a lot in the past few weeks .
no , emily , this makes sense .
mona knows that you &apos;re searching for toby .
i saw her stare at you in the brew this morning ,
and now this .
okay , i &apos;ll keep my eyes open .
no . she made it seem like
something bad was gonna happen to you tonight .
look , i &apos;m gonna stay with you for the rest of the day .
i gotta get to swim practice .
do not ignore this !
i &apos;m not ignoring it , but we don &apos;t know for sure what this means .
okay ? let me hang on to this .
you don &apos;t need to be staring at it for the rest of the day .
at least promise me that you &apos;ll stop looking for toby .
fine . i &apos;ll stop looking for him .
look , i &apos;ll call you when i get home , okay ?
okay .
how long has he been like that for ?
he &apos;s been on a raid for the past hour .
i still cannot believe
that you &apos;re baby @-@ sitting your boyfriend &apos;s kid .
well , i still can &apos;t believe that my boyfriend has a kid .
so what &apos;s gonna happen if malcolm and maggie move here ?
what do you mean ?
well , when they were in delaware , that was one thing ,
but if they come here , where does that leave you and ezra ?
i don &apos;t know .
but we &apos;ll figure it out . we always do .
and you &apos;re sure that maggie &apos;s okay
with you being part of the equation ?
she seems to be .
i guess she &apos;s not who i thought she was .
there &apos;s a lot of that going around .
you know , i was thinking .
if toby is working with mona ,
there had to have been some signs that we missed .
i always wondered how toby found dr. sullivan
after mona ran her out of town .
and then he brought her
back the exact night that mona was caught .
you think that it was planned ?
well , i think that mona knew
we were getting close to where the lair was .
and bringing dr. sullivan back helped mona because ... ?
she diagnosed her with a mental disorder .
and that helped ensure that she went to radley , not to jail .
everything okay ?
what ?
oh . um ... yeah .
no , i @-@ i just completely forgot ,
i &apos;m gonna be late to meet my mom ,
so i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
yeah , okay .
are you sure there &apos;s nothing you can do ?
honey , i &apos;m sure if toby were really missing
his family would have filed a report by now .
his family is away .
maybe he &apos;s with them .
i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m assuming that you have called him and tried to text him .
yeah , he &apos;s not responding .
i &apos;m worried . i don &apos;t think
he took his break with spencer very well .
honey , you have such a big heart ,
and you always see the best in everyone .
but honestly , i wish that you would just let this go .
i don &apos;t trust toby . i haven &apos;t since he caused that fire .
rosewood police .
yes , miss maloney ,
let me check on the status of that .
all right , please hold .
mom , can i use your computer to check my email ?
yeah , just be quick about it .
hey , spence , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m just calling to check on you .
call me back .
hey , i &apos;m gonna grab some
juice boxes for us to take to the park , okay ?
oh , my god .
what happened ? hey , come here .
oh , my god .

you all right ?
yeah . almost done .
hello .
yeah , it &apos;s all here .
i &apos;m on my way .
i should be banned from ever being around kids .
no , aria , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not !
you have every right to be angry with me .
i @-@ i &apos;m not angry . these things happen .
he cut his chin . that &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re a boy .
so you were ... talking with spencer when he fell ?
no . like i said , i left her a quick message ,
and then i hung up the phone .
you didn &apos;t see him jumping on the bed ?
ezra , by the time i turned around , it was too late .
so you weren &apos;t watching him the whole time .
it sure sounds like you &apos;re angry at me .
i just want to be clear on what happened
so i know what to tell maggie .
tell her that i feel like crap ,
that he son got hurt while i was watching him .
tell her that it was my fault ,
i should have been paying closer attention ,
and tell her that i am so sorry ...
but i don &apos;t know the first thing about being a parent .
neither do i.
mom , where are you ? call me when you get this .
wilden : ... compared to what i &apos;ll do if hanna talks .
ashley : i wonder how your lieutenant will respond
when he hears you &apos;re threatening a child .
he &apos;s not going to .
think this through , ashley .
how do you live with yourself ?
hey , we &apos;re not done here !
get out of my way !
i can &apos;t let you go !
get out of my way !
either you shut hanna up , or i will !
you have arrived at your destination .
就你一个人
hey , you &apos;ll be back in action in no time .
mm @-@ hmm . and ezra says that when you &apos;re feeling all better ,
he &apos;s gonna take you on a trampoline for some real fun .
i am ?
yeah , malcolm , we &apos;re gonna be kings of that trampoline .
maggie , i am so sorry .
mommy &apos;s here . are you feeling okay ?
he &apos;s fine . just worn out .
how bad was the cut ?
it wasn &apos;t bad . just a few stitches .
the doctor &apos;s gonna be back in in a second to check on him .
are you immediate family ?
um , no .
then you need to wait outside .
he &apos;s dead .
mona ! ! !
mona ! ! !
i &apos;m sorry i lied to you .
are you mad ?
mad ? no .
sad , a little ,
because i don &apos;t know how to help you with this situation .
am i just crazy to think that this could work ?
it &apos;s definitely not gonna be easy .
it was one thing when i thought
that ezra &apos;s son lived in delaware ,
but if malcolm and maggie move here ...
it &apos;s gonna be even more complicated .
ezra seems really happy to have him in his life .
well , having a child is great ,
but it completely changes your life .
it stops being about what you want ,
and it starts being about
what you can do to make your child &apos;s life better .
i know that ...
things are gonna change between us , obviously .
i think the question is : how much ?
well , what does ezra say about this ?
he thinks it can work if we both try .
maybe it can .
but it &apos;s also okay if you don &apos;t want it to .
i love him .
i know you do .
but not every relationship is meant to last forever .
and sometimes the best thing you can do is take a step back
and give yourself a chance to breathe .
excuse me .
you again .
oh . hi .
is this your workshop ?
yep .
i &apos;m sorry , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m supposed to meet toby .
i told you he &apos;s out of town .
i know , but i just got a text from him ,
and then he told me to meet him here two hours ago .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
i haven &apos;t seen him .
did you see a blond come through here ?
nobody &apos;s come through here in the last few hours .
i just saw her . she was wearing a red coat .
look , no toby , no girl in a red coat ,
and no unicorns , either . sorry , emily .
how do you know my name ?
because you told me earlier .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i gotta get back to work .
i don &apos;t understand .
i hit that black box like a hundred times ,
and it didn &apos;t even crack .
the video just kept playing over and over .
i don &apos;t think that it really matters ,
because whoever put that
car in your garage has probably made copies .
well , it has to be &quot; a. &quot; why would wilden put his car in there ?
okay , so if &quot; a &quot; did this , and nobody &apos;s seen wilden ,
does that mean that wilden &apos;s dead and that &quot; a &quot; has his body ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think that maybe you should tell your mom .
what ? !
she can handle a lot more than you think .
aria , our moms are totally different .
mine hit the accelerator , remember ?
and besides , i don &apos;t want to
involve her until we know what we &apos;re dealing with .
she already is involved , hanna !
she is on that video , and it really doesn &apos;t look good for her .
well , if &quot; a &quot; drove it here , who knows what &apos;s next ?
the cops could be on their way .
you know what , just get in your car . follow me .
where are we going ?
i really don &apos;t think this is a good idea .
just keep pushing .
there &apos;s gotta be a better solution !
well , there isn &apos;t !
i &apos;m serious , hanna .
we really , really need to rethink this .
too late .
i thought it would sink faster .
yeah , me too .
well , what if it just stays there like that ?
it &apos;ll sink .
they &apos;re gonna be looking for his car .
i know .
look , if they find it and they trace it back to us ,
we are totally screwed .
yep .
told you it would sink .
where have you been ? i &apos;ve been calling you for the last hour .
sorry . i had to help aria out with something .
have you eaten ?
are you all right ?
yeah . are you ?
uh , no .
but i &apos;m ... getting there .
what does that mean ?
i think i saw detective wilden today .
what ? where ?
in town .
but i wasn &apos;t sure , so ...
i drove by the accident on my way home .
guess what ? his car was gone .
of course , i panicked at first ,
but then it occurred to me--
if he had been ... really injured ,
we would have heard about it by now , right ?
and if he was gonna press charges ,
we would have heard about it by now .
uh , so that means ... ?
maybe i didn &apos;t hit him ...
as hard as i thought , and maybe ...
maybe he woke up and realized he was in the wrong .
and maybe this whole thing is just gonna ....
go away .
uh , i &apos;m gonna go to sleep .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
you can also put ...
it &apos;s almost like the e accident didn &apos;t happen .
he &apos;s doing just fine .
that &apos;s good to hear .
do you want to come over ?
we &apos;re about to build a castle .
i &apos;d love to , but , um ...
i &apos;m--i &apos;m helping my mom paint her kitchen ,
so i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
all right .
i love you .
i love you too .
no name ?
yep , jane doe .
no i.d. , no cell phone ,
no keys , nothing .
who found her ?
a hiker . about an hour ago .
said he saw her wandering around looking lost and confused .
i &apos;m bringing her in .
better put in a request for a psych evaluation .
roger that .
wait . you dumped his car in a lake ?
i panicked .
you &apos;re supposed to stop her from doing stupid things like this ,
not help .
i tried !
i didn &apos;t know if it was wilden or &quot; a &quot; messing with us ,
so i just--i had to get rid of it .
well , my money &apos;s on &quot; a. &quot;
or wilden could still be alive
and part of the &quot; a &quot; team .
okay , so what does this mean ?
is toby dead ?
did i do this ? is this my fault ?
don &apos;t go there . all right ?
because we don &apos;t even know if this is true .
we do know that toby
was wearing a black hoodie in spencer &apos;s kitchen .
so ?
so either &quot; a &quot; could have killed him
because she knew he was gonna help us--
maybe he never was gonna help us ...
and for some reason
he just wants us to think that he &apos;s dead .
either way , spencer needs to know about this .
where is spencer ?
