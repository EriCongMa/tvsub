telling me that i look like one of the most handsome men in politics
does not hurt my feelings , winston .
last night was horrible .
sam came over ,
we tried to make out , i stopped it ,
and then we just laid there
like two old couple in the notebook waiting to die .

one day closer to death !
winston , what is wrong with you ?
no . nothing wrong with me , girl . i &apos;m just brushing my hair .
i just want to say that i had meaningless ,
wonderful sex last night with sam .
and that sex would not have been possible
without the efforts of a one nick miller .
ugh ! but okay .
i don &apos;t want to kiss and tell ,
but he did ruin my dresser during intercourse .
come on ! why are you saying that ?
will you go to ikea with me ?

but don &apos;t let me lay my eyes on the malm collection .
i can &apos;t afford it , and i &apos;m a sucker for it every time .
i &apos;ll go get my golf pencils .
if you got something to say , my man , just say it .
hey , look , a man can only sit back and observe
but for so long before he has to speak his mind .
then speak your mind .
a line has been crossed , all right ?
you , my friend , have become her fluffer .
替男星 &quot; 准备就绪 &quot; 预热 &quot; 器官 &quot; 的人
like in porn ?
an emotional fluffer .
i &apos;m an emotional fluffer ?
you got to set some boundaries , all right ?
you &apos;re gonna start fulfilling ever single need of hers , all right ?
doing all the things that a boyfriend would do ...
winston ...
... for some other dude who ain &apos;t doing nothing .
and i &apos;m her friend .
you &apos;re her boyfriend .
no , i &apos;m not her boyfriend .
you &apos;re a boyfriend without the rewards .
how about this ? why don &apos;t you just shut up ?
hey , nick , you ready ?
yeah .
so it &apos;s not available at the closest ikea ,
but it is available at the second @-@ closest ikea ,

i had so much sex last night .
fluffer .
外形简单利落 价格约在五百到一千五之间

you &apos;re calling mitt romney &quot; dad &quot; now ?
that &apos;s where we &apos;re at ?
schmidt , we get it .
he &apos;s the dad you never had .
okay , all @-@ knowing indian god ganesha ,
世人相信迦尼萨会带给人成功和幸福
this is about sex .
you know they have romney olympics
every summer at the lake house ?
i bet that &apos;s a hoot .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s like the real olympics ,
only the white people win the sprints .
okay , so you good ?
okay .
hey , nick , any chance you understand how to put this together ?
i think it looks pretty easy , actually .
no , you know , i &apos;m actually busy . i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m moving money around .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m diversifying . i &apos;ve got ...
and i &apos;m not your fluffer , by the way .
what &apos;s a fluffer ?
in pornography ,
it &apos;s the person who keeps the actor ...
motivated , aroused , you know ?
ew ! that &apos;s a job ?
and that &apos;s what i am . i &apos;m your emotional fluffer .
i &apos;m there whenever you need a guy .
you want a cup of tea , i &apos;ll make it .
you lose your phone , i &apos;ll call .
you &apos;re my friend . that &apos;s what friends do .
i &apos;m you boyfriend without the rewards .
yeah .
you &apos;re saying you want the ... ?
no ! no , no , no , no , no . not with you . blecch !
don &apos;t say &quot; blecch ! &quot;
i don &apos;t want it .
i &apos;m not disgusting . it &apos;s not an unheard of thought .
blecch !
come on . admit it , you &apos;ve thought about it .
you and me , sexually ? nope .
blecch ! never thought about it once .
don &apos;t lie .
not on purpose .
sleeping nick is a totally different guy .
you know you did when you walked in on me doing deep lunges .
yeah , check my google history , jess .
it &apos;s filled with girls doing deep lunges .
i mean , i &apos;ll admit i &apos;ve thought about it .
yeah .
when was this ?
last year . just once .
would you like to eat me ?
what do you mean ? aren &apos;t you a little small ?
what , are you nuts ? !
what happened ?
why am i doing this ?
that &apos;s what does it for you ?
yeah , i thought about it for five minutes ,
and then i realized it would never , ever work between us .
yeah , i agree . that &apos;s how i see it .
great . i &apos;m glad we agree on something .
me , too !
great .
out of curiosity , why do you think that , though ?
because you drive me nuts , miller !
because you &apos;re always sighing ,
like you &apos;re the president of the united states
and you have to decide whether we &apos;re going to war or not .
i sigh because you sing about everything .
i do not .
and i hate it .
you sing and dance about nothing .
you &apos;re cheap ! you are so cheap .
i &apos;m not cheap .
you never , ever put money in any tip jar , ever .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ve never seen you ever do that .
last week , when we went to the coffee shop .
you put nickels in the tip jar !
you know what
a jar is in my business ?
nickels !
nickels are worse than no money ; it &apos;s an insult .
it &apos;s just a little boy saying ,
&quot; love me ! give me attention ! &quot;
you &apos;re a bartender . you live on tips .
the nickel ? the only american currency ...
you should know better .
you can &apos;t not give someone a tip because you don &apos;t like tip jars ! &apos;
graced with the face of thomas jefferson .
well , i think that &apos;s rude , nick !
i didn &apos;t realize you were on the fence
you hate everything !
about the louisiana purchase . jessica !
and i could never live with that . i barely live with it now !
but you need me to have sex .
oh , that &apos;s what you think ?
i &apos;m calling sam ,
and we &apos;re gonna go on a date .
and we &apos;re gonna talk our faces off .
okay ?
good luck . good luck with that .
can &apos;t find your phone , jess ?
no , i &apos;ll find it .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not calling you this time .
are you happy now ?
now i have to get to know the guy i &apos;m sleeping with .
that was a pocket dial !
that was an ill @-@ timed pocket dial !
i will not explain myself !
i just wish i had a lot more solo tugg time .
you know ?
well , you can be tugg with me .
sometimes i think that i &apos;m just a riddle that ,
well , even i can &apos;t solve .
yeah , see ? i tried to solve it again .
i hope it &apos;s okay ,
i invited over some of the kappas for romney .
kappas for romney !
courtney .
such a pleasure .
courtney .
i &apos;m april .
april .
they just got so excited when i said i met one of the romney boys .
oh , no , who wouldn &apos;t be ?
did you ask him ?
i think april &apos;s in love with your brothers .
who isn &apos;t ?
who &apos;s the shy one ?
who &apos;s the joker ? who &apos;s tried coffee ?
april , you &apos;re such a spaz .
yeah , no , nobody gets rowdy like us romney boys .
just a bunch of alphas , you know what i mean ?
that is , of course , unless we &apos;re fishing on lake winnipesauke .
there &apos;s nothing that i love more than just
getting out on the water with dad ,
the freezing cold dawn ,
a couple of cold beers in hand .
having that one quick moment ...
your dad doesn &apos;t drink . he &apos;s a mormon .
well , we don &apos;t drink the beers , courtney .
you know , we just buy them to support american breweries .
then we dump them in the lake .
&apos;cause we &apos;re americans .
so ... um ...
i want a casual sex affair , just like in the movies .
nice .
but it turns out ...
i need some conversation first .
so ...
if you want to hang ...
no .
... gang out more ...
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t want to hang out more .
okay .
because , if i hang out with you ,
it &apos;s just the truth , i &apos;m gonna fall in love with you .
it &apos;s just how i am . i can &apos;t separate things out .
question : under what circumstances
would you build a dresser for a woman ?
and this is , like ...
and i &apos;m not interested in sleeping with her ?
am i being blackmailed ?
no .
oh , is it like a ...
it &apos;s like a make @-@ a @-@ wish foundation type thing ?
no .
i mean ... yeah . marriage .
you know , anything besides marriage is a ...
you know , an abuse .
an abuse ?
yeah , you can &apos;t do that to a friend .
unless your friend &apos;s a chump .
or a certified carpenter-- that would work .
wait a minute . this isn &apos;t a sex thing , is it ?
because i ... you know ,
i can &apos;t pleasure a woman
and build a dresser at the same time , you know ?
i &apos;m not god .
hey ! hey , what &apos;s going on , man ?
are you going to the dark place ?
i &apos;m not going to the dark place , okay ?
i did what you said ,
i told her i didn &apos;t want to be her fluffer ,
and it went great .
then what is wrong with you ? get up , man .
look , i did what you said , and i feel terrible .
because you didn &apos;t set boundaries .
i don &apos;t know what that means , winston .
as a friend , you can lift a heavy object ,
but you can &apos;t drive her to the airport , okay ?
you can hold the elevator ,
but only if you see her running down the hallway saying ,
&quot; hey , man , please can you hold the elevator ? &quot;
no picnics , no mini @-@ muffins
and never adele .
adele ?
never adele .
adele &apos;s amazing .
no adele .
no concerts , no music ,
no t @-@ shirts , no nothing .
but guys and girls ...
never adele !
a little adele .
nick ! you &apos;re gonna calm down , okay ?
you want my help or what , man ?
yes .
don &apos;t be so intense .
most importantly ...
you will not build her that dresser .
it &apos;s furniture .
it implies that one day ,
you will share it with her .
and that &apos;s not gonna happen .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
are @-@ are you spelling it right ?
two &quot; g &quot; s , silent &quot; b. &quot;
here &apos;s a picture of the whole family .
and you are not in it .
yeah , well , somebody had to take the picture , megan .
just admit it . you &apos;re not a romney .
oh , i &apos;m not a romney ?
would a non @-@ romney know this ?
that ma and pa never go to bed angry .
that there are 16 grandchildren ,
allie , joe , thomas , gracie , wyatt , parker , miles , jonathan ,
sawyer , nate , nash , mia , owen , soleil , nick and chloe .
those are just facts you got from the internet .
i &apos;m proud to be a romney .
okay ? i &apos;m proud to have had a dad that was around
when i was growing up .
a dad that took me camping ,
a dad that spent saturdays with me ,
throwing ... throwing the football .
a dad that gave me a wink
when i left for prom night and said ,
&quot; be safe , son . &quot;
when i think of a dad like that ,
i &apos;m proud not only of the romney name ,
but of this country .
god bless mitt romney .
god bless america .
it &apos;s a candid shot from the governor &apos;s biography .
the caption says , &quot; the whole family . &quot;
nitpicking turns me off .
you &apos;re all horribly unattractive to me .
tugg romney , out .
i got your text .
when you &apos;re going through a taylor swift @-@ like range of emotions ,
i should come over , right ?
you were the only one that i could talk to .
being brown ,
you have the wisdom of 1,000 white women .
all right .
what happened with that girl ?
winston .
winston .
are you serious right now ?
he @-@ he said it was okay .
she is off limits .
go call your girlfriend .
you obviously have things you need to work out .
fine . fine .
but for the record , it was loving and tender
and you squeezed my hand at the end .
get out of here !
deviant .
okay , so ...
tell me what happened .
well , i &apos;m back to being schmidt .
i &apos;m gonna miss it , though . being a romney .
schmidt , your life would not have been better
if you were a romney .
cece , look , my dad left when i was eight .
okay ? and then he went and had three kids with his new wife ,
and me and my mom were just these two weirdos who belonged to nobody .
until she started spending all this time
with this woman from work who ...
who she still lives with today .
schmidt .
he &apos;s your dad . all right ?
find a way to forgive him
for not being a presidential candidate with great hair .
forget it .
no one understands .
there , i thought you needed that , okay ?
just take a breath , and it will
it &apos;s like memory foam .
call your dad .
you &apos;ve been cheating on me in your mind ?
yes , but , like , to be fair , you were there .
a lot of times , you would just pop up mad ,
but you were there .
winston , come on , it &apos;s fine .
look , you can think about whatever you want to think about .
i know i &apos;m the one you want to be with .
come on , want to come upstairs and watch some svu ?
you want to watch svu right now ?
well , i &apos;m too wound up to watch raymond .
look , sometimes after a big fight , i like to cool off with some tv .
what do you mean , big fight ?
we just had a fight .
we hardly talked .
like , i want to talk , i want to fight ,
i want to do something !
well , maybe we can fight in your mind .
stop .
jess
stop . do not ... come on , nick .
don &apos;t build that dresser , please .
jess , it &apos;s fine . i have another one .
i need , like , three to build this thing .
i can &apos;t let you fluff me .
i can &apos;t let you work in emotional porn .
you have too much to offer .
forget it , jess .
i &apos;m building you the dresser .
i love this stuff .
it &apos;s like high @-@ stakes legos .
okay , but ...
i didn &apos;t know what i was doing to you .
i &apos;ve always had relationships in different boxes .
friends in one box , boyfriends in another .
but now ...
it &apos;s messy , and ...
i don &apos;t want to screw up what i have with you .
you &apos;re too important to me .
it &apos;s different with us .
we &apos;re just two people who want to be friends ,
but are sometimes attracted to each other .
ha !
no , no ...
you have thought about the reward .
that &apos;s not what i said .
my calculations were correct .
i love deep lunges .
just don &apos;t make a big deal of it .
i just don &apos;t need a bunch of people
telling me what we can and can &apos;t do together .
that pisses me off .
if i want to build you a dresser ,
i &apos;m gonna build you a damn dresser .
but if you want to have dates before sex ,
just do me a favor and have them with the guy you &apos;re having sex with .
agreed .
good .
maybe i should just stop trying with sam .
i &apos;m old @-@ fashioned below the belt .
i &apos;ve got a civil war @-@ era piece of equipment ,
and that &apos;s all she wrote .
all right .
i got to give you something now .
something ... really close to my heart .
that &apos;s nick &apos;s sexy mix .
aka the original fluffer .
&quot; the humpty dance &quot; does it for you , nick ?
do your thing , girl .
get crazy .
when we &apos;re done ,
i want you to immediately turn this off .
