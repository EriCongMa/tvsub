aj !
jesus , meadow , chill out !
inevitably , sukanya , what goes in must comes out .
and these people now being released from prison were jailed
during the big mafia crackdowns of the 1980s ?
seems like yesterday , doesn &apos;t it ?
for years we heard how law enforcement broke the back of the mob .
well , they &apos;ve served their time .
&quot; it &apos;s the old never @-@ ending battle against crime and corruption , &quot;
to quote superman .
what do you think is gonna happen with this infusion of new blood ?
we could be looking at a period of potentially violent struggle .
they gonna paint everythin &apos; the worst .
how long till dinner ?
any familiar names ?
in new york , the only old @-@ style boss still in place is carmine lupertazzi .
he &apos;ll soon be rejoined by angelo garepe , his former consigliere .
also philip leotardo , long @-@ time lupertazzi captain .
can you help me here ? crush some ice ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
new jersey &apos;s a better case in point .
you &apos;ve got michele &quot; feech &quot; la manna , released just this week ,
a man greatly feared and respected in the &apos; 70s .
amen to that .
similar situation with anthony blundetto in
that same jersey crime family , the sopranos .
let me see how he looks .
still is as far as i know .
28 years old when he went away . a rising star .
thought to be the central suspect in the
car @-@ bomb killing of thomas gilardi and his driver .
that &apos;s the best picture they could find ?
he was a fox .
will you pipe down ? we &apos;re tryin &apos; to watch .
it &apos;s my house , tony .
what are you watching ?
go call your brother for dinner .
bobby !
be nice to have him back , huh ?
your cousin ?
missed the shit out of him .
the older you are , the more you &apos;re entitled to eat .
hi , sorry .
where the hell you been ?
your mother didn &apos;t send anything ?
she wasn &apos;t even home .
her and aunt ro went out to dinner , i think .
everybody sit !
now please .
this is great of you , aunt jan , keeping the sunday dinner tradition going .
can you get the roast out of the oven ?
canned clam chowder ?
go sit , god damn it .
oh , shit .
what ?
my wedding ring .
goin &apos; to strap on the bag , ton &apos; ?
yeah .
would you say this is an interesting point in the history of the mafia ?
i &apos;d say we &apos;re looking at a great year for crime reporters , sukanya .
anthony !
what ?
i wanna say hello . wh ... can you stop a minute ?
how was dinner ?
fine .
what &apos;d you have ?
roast beef .
did your father pick up his mail when he dropped you off ?
no , he didn &apos;t come in . he was tired .
he said he just wanted to go to bed . i &apos;m trying to practice .
i see you didn &apos;t bring the power vac in from the pool house like i asked .
why does that even have to be done ?
grandpa &apos;s still gonna have to lift it into his truck .
i don &apos;t want him to have to drag it from all the way out back .
it &apos;s so nice to have a man around the house .
you should &apos;ve thought about that before .
what did you say ?
go out and get that vacuum , now !
what did i just say ? ! go !
mom ! mommy ! oh my god .
mommy , help ! mommy ?
mom .
mommy .
aj , be quiet , don &apos;t move .
mommy ?
mommy !
go get dad &apos;s gun !
it &apos;s all the way in the dining room !
hey , go away ! go !
hey ! get outta here !
go !
how &apos;s the olive loaf ?
you know what i like ?
i like the gulden &apos;s brown mustard .
are you leaving ?
yeah , i got a overseas call comin &apos; at home .
finish your sandwich , at least , first .
oh , yeah , yeah , no .
could be the same one from willow drive .
god . the most densely populated state in the country , and still this .
gone . he went through your neighbor &apos;s garbage , though , the kalcheims ?
it &apos;s been goin &apos; on all over . if my son had been alone ...
you &apos;re not gonna put your trash cans out until as close to pick @-@ up time as possible .
you hear that ?
put ammonia or bleach in the container and on the lid .
i posted a notice for your neighbors .
if this had been a category two , injury or serious property damage ,
we could set traps , but not for this .
you should &apos;ve busted a cap in his ass with dad &apos;s rifle .
it &apos;s illegal to discharge firearms within the borough limits .
you &apos;re gonna call dad , aren &apos;t you ?
no .
the great percentage of them don &apos;t come back .
if he does ... call us .
oh , do you have bird feed back there ?
ah , duck food , yes , my husband &apos;s .
it &apos;s probably what attracted the animal .
see , the corn &apos;s gotten damp and aromatic .
you might wanna tell your husband to put it inside .
right .
setting up the equipment is a complicated affair .
video cameras with built @-@ in recorders ...
then the car that he qualifi ...
hello .
i &apos;m dr. lowenstein .
whoa , whoa , whoa . go back .
what ?
come on .
you &apos;re kidding .
no , go back , please !
why don &apos;t you come in ?
i like nolte .
why didn &apos;t you tell me last night ?
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s a long story , let &apos;s just skip it .
i &apos;ll try to think of a better one .
what &apos;s bothering you ?
global warming , acid rain , the national debt ? never even know what &apos;s goin &apos; on .
look at her nails , totally real .
you weren &apos;t paying attention .
let &apos;s face it , women are more devious than men .
one of my therapists was a woman .
too bad you didn &apos;t get all your talkin &apos; done with her .
you expect a man to be a tower of strength .
then when it turns out he &apos;s got a few weaknesses and some insecurities ,
what do you do ? you turn around and you betray him !
so you feel that your mother betrayed you ?
doggone , i hate this freudian crap .
it &apos;s not your job to listen to my problems anyway !
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to go .
you &apos;re free to leave anytime you want .
good !
goddamn shrink . who was i kiddin &apos; ?
what are you smiling at ?
i was a champion ...
nothin &apos; , i don &apos;t know .
you have this goofy look on your face .
come on .
... until susan lowenstein came along .
her questions makin &apos; me as dizzy as her perfume .
jennifer melfi ?
yes ?
so we open the fuckin &apos; trunk ,
this suffocatin &apos; russian cocksucker pops up ! he &apos;s still alive !
we lead him through the snow . this asshole &apos;s shiverin &apos; ...
he &apos;s wearin &apos; fuckin &apos; pajamas and slippers in like 8 â„ƒ weather .
hey !
here he is .
how you doin &apos; ?
fellas ?
hey , ton &apos; .
radio on the way in . another incident at the airport .
fuckin &apos; assholes .
i gotta make a couple calls .
anyway , he starts runnin &apos; , the russian .
boom ! i &apos;m tellin &apos; you the top of his head came off like a fuckin &apos; bad rug .
what a beating we had to give this prick , ooh madonn &apos; .
where is he now ?
who the fuck cares , right , chrissie ?
who the fuck knows ?
poor bastard .
never would &apos;ve happened if paulie hadn &apos;t initially overreacted ,
but it &apos;s one for the books .
what do you mean overreacted ?
you choked him with the lamp , paulie , or we could &apos;ve got
silvio shcarole without havin &apos; to spend the night in the open .
you let him jab you with that shovel was the problem . lets his guard down .
we would &apos;ve caught up to the prick , if you didn &apos;t lose your fuckin &apos; shoe !
wait , you lost your shoe ? you didn &apos;t tell us about that .
- &quot; chrissie , please , don &apos;t leave me out here . &quot; -you little cocksucker !
i covered your ass with tony about that whole thing ,
and never a word of fuckin &apos; thanks , ever !
always playin &apos; that blood @-@ relation card . tony &apos;s little favorite .
fuck you !
what ?
come on ! -come on .
what the fuck ?
that was a good story , damn it .
tellin &apos; you right now ...
it &apos;s finished with us .
goodbye , dr. melfi .
see you next week .
hello ?
like the flowers ?
and yeah , before you ask , i am takin &apos; the medication .
how are you , anthony ?
it &apos;s been a long time .
i &apos;m great , actually . you ?
thank you for that beautiful arrangement .
i see you haven &apos;t lost your sense of humor .
you gotta have a sense of humor in life , right ? you taught me that .
and how is life ?
good , good .
well , i &apos;m separated , me and carmela .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
don &apos;t be ,
well , i always thought i saw some good things there .
two healthy kids , other than that ...
look , the reason i called ...
i &apos;d like you to have dinner with me .
since we &apos;re not in therapy no more and i &apos;m a bachelor again ...
that &apos;s very thoughtful of you .
unfortunately , because of our prior clinical relationship ,
i just can &apos;t do it .
what , eat ? you must be a toothpick .
you know what i mean .
see , i knew you were gonna say somethin &apos; like that .
i can &apos;t , anthony , i &apos;m sorry .
you know , i waited a respectable period or whatever before makin &apos; this call .
then you realize yourself
there &apos;s something not quite right about us dating .
no , i &apos;m not undeterred by this . we will talk again .
thank you for the flowers .
and the detergent .
and the detergent .
-of course , what &apos;s wrong with me ? -i don &apos;t know ,
but we &apos;ll find out .
leave it to dr. tony .
what &apos;s the matter ?
the bear . stay there !
oh , right , lock the door .
what , do you think he &apos;s gonna wipe his feet , too ?
he &apos;ll smash through the glass .
-now where is that guy &apos;s card ? -i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ve reached fish and game . if you know the extension ...
unbelievable . -if not , press zero for directory .
hello ? !
for hunting and fishing licenses , press two .
you get a letter from my cousin in the can ?
yes , officer zmuida , hi . yes , mrs. soprano from north caldwell ?
we had the bear in our yard .
what the fuck ?
yes , it came back .
was anybody hurt ?
no , thank god .
property damage ?
no property damage either i could see ,
but i didn &apos;t really wanna go out there .
oh , one of those eastern black bears ?
we &apos;ll be up in about an hour .
yes , that &apos;d be great ,
okay , we &apos;ll be here .
all right , see you then .
jesus christ , when did this happen ?
the first time sunday night , and i saw it again just now .
aj didn &apos;t even mention it to you when you two went to the game ?
no !
i have to warn the cusamanos .
they keep esterhaz chained up along the side there .
that bear will rip him to pieces .
cusamanos weren &apos;t home . got the machine .
well , i don &apos;t see esterhaz .
why didn &apos;t you call me when this first happened ?
i called the cops . they called fish and game .
are you tryin &apos; to prove you &apos;re independent ?
this isn &apos;t &quot; little house on the prairie . &quot;
this isn &apos;t &quot; little house on the prairie . &quot;
the ranger , whatever ,
said it was your duck food out there that attracted it .
i never heard of that happening before .
trapper joe over here .
we didn &apos;t find a spoor .
i was just tellin &apos; the gentleman
the animal still doesn &apos;t meet the parameters for removal .
oh , jeez .
so , when somebody &apos;s leg is gone ...
problem is it hasn &apos;t really threatened anybody .
sorry .
whoa , whoa , hold on a minute .
you and your pal buy some new lanyards for your whistles .
oh , we can &apos;t accept that . and we don &apos;t have whistles .
thanks , though .
ranger rick &apos;s a little light in the timberlands , huh ?
everybody &apos;s always gay with you . he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , that &apos;s all .
i already put the ammonia on the cans , i told you .
look , i came here to give you your money , but ...
this bear thing , though ,
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m ... i &apos;m worried . you and aj here by yourselves .
what can we do ? you want coffee ?
last time it had a weird taste .
the coffeemaker is shot .
the heating element is corroded , i told you .
that &apos;s not the problem .
you don &apos;t need another one . last month , it was the upstairs toilet . basta .
he goes down the street to willow drive , too ,
maybe he &apos;ll stay down there .
all right , look ,
you and aj , you check yourself into a hotel until this thing blows over .
here &apos;s 1,200 extra on top of our agreement .
i &apos;m not going to a hotel .
why not ?
i don &apos;t wanna break anthony &apos;s routines .
he &apos;ll get a kick out of it .
it &apos;s an adventure . god knows he loves room service .
yeah , i &apos;ll give him room service ... the end of my foot .
what &apos;s with the attitude ?
well , he &apos;s an asshole , that &apos;s what .
so what ? it &apos;s his age .
yeah , thank you , i know .
but you buy him too much stuff ,
i think because you feel guilty about the separation .
excuse me . it wasn &apos;t my idea .
there is more than one way to ask for something .
could we please not ?
spend $ 5,000 on a set of drums ..
sat tutor , coffeemaker , i gotta fight you tooth and nail .
all i said was i wanna see statements from the tutor or he doesn &apos;t get paid !
he &apos;s a college kid , tony , he &apos;s not set up for that .
you worried he &apos;s gonna soak you for an extra pencil ?
oh , rimshot !
what i think , tony , is you &apos;re trying to make my life now
as hard on me financially as possible .
oh , it should be easy .
unbelievable .
what do you think , you &apos;re the only catholic here ?
i &apos;m old school . i don &apos;t believe in this separation shit and divorce ,
even if my wife was going after some fucking immigrant !
yet you are modern enough to use a cell phone to call italy
and every other fucking place to threaten the guy &apos;s life .
oh , that &apos;s right . certain people see him , he &apos;s a dead man .
he had coffee here , tony , that &apos;s all .
and now the coffeemaker sucks .
how do you like them apples ?
you don &apos;t wanna stay at a hotel , you suit yourself .
this is anthony .
could you call me at 973 @-@ 555 @-@ 1299 ?
i &apos;m thinking maybe i gotta come back , you know , for therapy .
smells good , feech .
yeah ? you want a taste ?
nah , i &apos;ll wait .
no offense , kid , but don &apos;t look to me like you do a lot of waiting .
just like his old man , huh ?
lotta changes since you went away , huh ?
20 years , madonn &apos; .
know what the biggest change for me is ?
broads shaving their bushes .
i went over to silvio &apos;s , it &apos;s like the girl scouts over there .
i think i &apos;ll let this simmer a bit .
must be different in the can now ,
not like the old days . fuckin &apos; animals .
it &apos;s all about setting a precedent .
first day there , i walk in a mess , i &apos;m wearin &apos; a puss , a fuckin &apos; scowl .
i look around ...
my nephew .
right in the middle of my story !
there he is ,
the man , the legend , feech la manna .
hey , my god look at you ! you big galoot !
what &apos;d you go straight from the joint to earl scheib ? look at this fucking tan .
you close the cellar door when you came up ?
it &apos;s like the bowery boys in here with this house arrest here .
code words and secret passages .
he &apos;s in the middle of a story .
when isn &apos;t he ?
it &apos;s day one , i &apos;m in the mess ,
i look around and i spot the biggest , blackest motherfucker that i can find .
everybody &apos;s looking at me and i walk right up to him and i say ,
&quot; what the fuck are you looking at ? &quot;
he says , &quot; what ? &quot;
i said , &quot; you heard me , motherfucker . what the fuck are you looking at ? ! &quot;
with that , i hit him ! bam ! right across the fucking coconut !
he goes down , i &apos;m on top of him .
everybody around ! he gets some shots in . everybody &apos;s going fucking crazy !
the screws , this guy , everybody ! &quot; motherfucker ! &quot;
from that time on , nobody so much as looks at me cross @-@ eyed !
well , welcome home , huh ?
welcome home .
welcome home .
the reason i wanted to see you , junior , tony too ,
now that i &apos;m out , i &apos;d like to get back in the game .
what &apos;d you have in mind ?
you know me , i &apos;m an entrepreneur .
get my shy going , sports book , whatever you say .
as long as you don &apos;t step on anybody &apos;s toes .
me ? i &apos;m fred astaire .
what &apos;s this feech tells me , you got a bear up there at the house ?
what , it &apos;s on fucking cnn ?
no , it &apos;s just that your wife &apos;s up there , and the kids ... your ex @-@ wife , whatever .
it &apos;s just that wild animals , they &apos;re dangerous . people talk .
what people ? who ?
i don &apos;t know .
what am i supposed to do , go up there personally and set fucking bear traps ?
we &apos;re separated , for christ &apos;s sake .
so , where &apos;s the dinner at ?
oh , i forget the name . it &apos;s in the car .
who &apos;s gonna be there ?
what are you , on the school paper ?
guys . it &apos;s business .
you got any cash ?
some .
hand me my bag .
that &apos;s all you got ?
it &apos;s like $ 400 .
i &apos;m low man tonight , i gotta pay for everybody .
you know , this is fucking ridiculous , christopher
why should you get stuck all the time ? you should make paulie pay .
what , i make the rules now ? guy &apos;s a captain .
i know , but when he was in jail ...
all &apos;s i &apos;m saying is if you get the extra responsibilities ,
you should get the benefits , too .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll say hello to the guys from you .
benny , hi ! come on in .
tony sent me . he says he wants somebody stationed in the yard .
he &apos;s worried the bear might come back .
what ? no , i don &apos;t want this .
we &apos;ll switch off , me and paulie germani .
this is silly , i &apos;m gonna call him .
actually , it &apos;s not that silly , mrs. s.
if it was my family , i &apos;d wanna know there was a male at the house , too .
what can you do about it if it does come back ?
tony said you should unlock the closet , give me the &quot; shkupit &quot; he called it .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
we &apos;ll call the fish and game , too .
it &apos;s just ... i &apos;ll have the weapon in case .
he &apos;s just worried about you , that &apos;s all . and anthony .
okay , i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re very nice to do this .
nice got nothing to do with it .
stay inside . you don &apos;t have to sit out there like a fistful of dollars .
tony said not in the house . i got my little sony in the car .
you want something to eat ? we were just about to sit down .
nah , i &apos;m good . i just stopped at tio pepe &apos;s .
this freaking olive oil . the food &apos;s drenched .
that &apos;s the reason it happened .
as far as fucking bears are concerned ? i say get rid of them all .
they had their turn , and now we got ours .
that &apos;s why dinosaurs don &apos;t exist no more .
wasn &apos;t it a meteor ?
they &apos;re all meat eaters .
meteor , meteor .
take it easy .
gentlemen , whenever you &apos;re ready .
all right , are we set ?
yeah , sure .
what are you doing , you ready ?
i gotta make a pit stop .
eh , you forgetting something ?
you get it . i got the last one .
here , baby , have some more cheesecake .
the other thing with bears is : if you &apos;re ever chased by one , run downhill .
for some reason , they can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s the moss .
they attack when you &apos;re having your period , too .
no , no , that &apos;s jungle cats .
so can we go ?
hold your horses .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on , we ready or what ?
yeah .
fine , i &apos;ll get it .
gimme the fucking thing .
i said i &apos;ll get it .
enough . it &apos;s done .
$ 860.00 .
what ?
you heard me . that &apos;s what you owe from last night .
you said , you got it . i only got like $ 100 on me , anyways .
then get the rest by tonight or you start paying points .
i &apos;m thinking of going for the acupuncture .
what , your shoulder again ?
those long drives . it &apos;s already tender .
next time , we get you out there .
after 18 years in the can , i &apos;m just happy to be outside .
what , they don &apos;t have a golf course at leavenworth ?
still a smart ass , this one .
carmine , you all right ? you barely touched your egg salad .
too much gherkins .
you smell that ?
what ?
burning hair .
i smell cut grass .
any word on your cousin getting out ?
who &apos;s your cousin again ?
tony blundetto .
oh , yeah , good guy . right , right .
he was my best buddy inside .
so you gonna give him a party ?
when he get home , get him laid .
what &apos;s the matter , carmine ?
carmine ?
jesus christ !
call an ambulance .
yes , sir . is he breathing ?
get that egg salad out of his mouth .
hurry up
lupertazzi residence .
carmine , it &apos;s john .
hey , john boy , how &apos;s the weather ?
look , i got some bad news . your dad &apos;s had a stroke .
oh my god , how bad ?
there &apos;s some paralysis .
it &apos;s too early to tell yet . they &apos;re doing everything they can .
is my mom there ?
i just called her , she &apos;s on her way .
we &apos;re over at st. vincent &apos;s .
anything , john , anything he needs .
i &apos;m on the next plane .
sad , this shit , huh ?
i wonder if i can smoke in here .
you know , i haven &apos;t forgotten our arrangement last year ,
you leaving me in the lurch like that .
it was the right thing to do , john .
taking out a boss ? come on .
even still .
what do you want , an apology ? fucking whitman sampler , what ?
boy , imagine if his fucking speech is affected . poor bastard .
when you &apos;re up at the house , who comes to visit ? anybody ?
mostly rosalie aprile , sil &apos;s wife .
who calls on the phone ?
most of the calls seem to be for anthony .
so ... ?
look , the real reason i &apos;m here is to confront you
in a positive way about taking our relationship in that other direction .
why did you have to be underhanded ? i don &apos;t find that appealing , frankly .
i was gonna ask you out for coffee or something ,
but i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d go .
i &apos;ll pay for the hour , that goes without saying .
forget that .
i was listening to that guy on tv , dr. phil ?
and he was talking about a similar situation
and he said that you could , if you wanted to .
there &apos;s no set rules . it &apos;s basically about malpractice ,
and you probably couldn &apos;t get sued .
that &apos;s not the point .
look , i was thinking about all kinds of moves ...
&quot; buy her a piece of jewelry .
pay the guy to close down the restaurant
where she eats lunch and hire a mandolin player . &quot;
this is the place where we &apos;ve been most honest with each other .
and that &apos;s the way i always liked it .
so that being said , if you don &apos;t like me personally ,
or the cut of my jib , or my face , or whatever ,
then the matter will end here and i will never ask you again .
you can be honest .
i like you , anthony . and , no , you have a very nice face .
working on the weight , too .
good .
explain to me , okay , why this is a matter of such importance to you .
there must be plenty of women out there .
you &apos;re different from what &apos;s out there ,
not to mention being drop @-@ dead beautiful .
my training teaches me to go fairly quickly to the idea that
what you really want is to come back to therapy .
jesus christ almighty , come on , will you ? !
your marriage of 20 @-@ something years has collapsed ,
no doubt there are issues with your children .
why can &apos;t i do something that &apos;s just for me for a change ?
it would be for you .
all right , well , i want you . and not just for the smart things you say .
i @-@ i @-@ i want ... i want your skin .
i want your mouth . i want your eyes .
you project all these qualities onto me . you don &apos;t know me .
this is what happens between doctor and patient .
don &apos;t do that .
outta respect for this office .
you know , forget about the way that tony soprano makes his way in the world ,
that &apos;s just to feed his children .
there &apos;s two tony sopranos . you &apos;ve never seen the other one .
that &apos;s the one i wanna show to you .
l ... i wonder if i could use the wc ?
of course , come on in .
yeah , okay .
is it cold out ?
yeah , a little ,
but i got a fleece .
i know him , he &apos;ll just keep coming back and coming back .
how to let him down easy , l ...
think it &apos;s worth telling the police ?
what ?
jesus , elliot .
i don &apos;t want to paint in somber tones here , but the man is a sociopath ,
unpracticed in not getting what he wants .
and now , since the therapy is kaput ,
what use are you to him except for sex ?
thank you , elliot . your depth of feeling is really quite extraordinary here .
all you could come up with was this weak borscht about professional ethics ,
because you are worried about how this thug will handle rejection .
you know , at first i did find him a little sexy ...
dangerous , alpha male ...
but as year followed year , the ugliness i saw , i heard ...
you kept him a long time , though .
there &apos;s a mutual sympathy there of some kind ,
i guess .
maybe it &apos;s just the italian thing .
sil said you were looking for me ?
sit down .
this about the easter baskets ?
i don &apos;t even know what that is ,
and , to tell you the truth , i don &apos;t wanna know .
now what &apos;s this shit between you and paulie ? you chiseled him out of a dinner ?
i chiseled him ? he said that ?
i asked you a question .
can i say something in my own defense ?
it &apos;s not right that i have to pay all the time .
i &apos;ve been paying for fucking years .
you done ? good .
you pay till i tell you you don &apos;t have to pay no more .
and don &apos;t give me that face .
you know how many tabs , how many dinners i picked up over the years ?
i got richie aprile , fat fucking jerry anastasia .
those guys killed me at benihana &apos;s .
and forget it , if they want a steak .
i put a new wing on peter luger &apos;s .
brandy , cigars , champagne . could &apos;ve bought a fucking plane .
i hear you , ton &apos; , but that was before inflation ...
whatever .
it &apos;s tradition . it &apos;s like in ancient times ,
the samurais , they had these pages ...

anthony .
hello .
hey . a friend of mine had these .
i &apos;ll see you next week .
like i was saying , a friend of mine had these and couldn &apos;t use them .
i figured , well ... maybe we could .
tickets , bermuda , lodging at the elbow beach hotel .
i turned down a wonderful dinner invitation ,
and you think i &apos;ll go away with you ?
well , the guy couldn &apos;t use them and you know , he gave them to me .
what do you want me to do , throw them away ?
come on , i &apos;m breaking out the big guns here .
you &apos;re turning me into half a stalker .
listen , anthony , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not going to go out with you , okay ?
and it &apos;s not because you &apos;re unattractive or
i don &apos;t think i would have a good time ,
it &apos;s just something i &apos;m not going to do .
and i would like you to respect my decision ,
and just try to feel that i know what &apos;s right for me .
okay ?
but it &apos;s not just the psychiatric ethics stuff , is it ?
i wanna preserve the option for you that you could always come back to our work ,
if you wish .
and that we could pick up where we &apos;ve left off .
i don &apos;t think you get this , i want you !
and that &apos;s very flattering to me .
i &apos;m not interested in flattering you .
i know you &apos;re not .
all right , then what is it ? okay , what is it ?
just help me understand it , okay ?
you know , anthony , during therapy l ... i never judged you or your behavior .
it &apos;s not the place of a therapist to do so .
all right , i get all this . go , go .
in a personal relationship , i don &apos;t think i could sit silent .
about what ?
our values are just very different .
you don &apos;t like my values ?
honestly ?
yeah .
no .
okay . like what ?
it &apos;s getting late , l ...
no , no , no . come on .
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay .
well ... you &apos;re not a truthful person .
you &apos;re not respectful of women . you &apos;re not really respectful of people .
i don &apos;t love people ?
maybe you love them , i don &apos;t know .
you take what you want from them by force or the threat of force .
i couldn &apos;t live like that . i couldn &apos;t bear witness to violence ...
fuck you !
you &apos;re a fucking cunt !
