yeah . i got your text .
i &apos;m on my way .
look , i &apos;m sorry , boss .
the lees &apos; pool took longer than expected .
they &apos;re out of town again .
the filter &apos;s all gunked up .
well , this doesn &apos;t sound like anything major .
just shorten the sensor .
yeah . i &apos;ll be there in 10 .
come on , cap .
don &apos;t give up . you &apos;ll get the hang of it .
you &apos;re wasting your time on this old dog .
i @-@ i &apos;m a casting rod @-@ off @-@ the @-@ jetty ,
sandwiches and beer kind of guy .
this harpoon stuff ain &apos;t my thing .
spearfishing .
i stand corrected .
huh , i guess mcgarrett was right .
right about what ?
oh , nothing .
he just said , you &apos;d never catch on quite as quick as he did .
oh , so mcgarrett said that , did he ?
oh , now , come on , don &apos;t let that get under your skin .
the guy &apos;s a navy seal . he grew up on the island .
you &apos;re a city boy .
he was a natural , though , i got to say .
he took home half a dozen fish on his very first time out .
how many ?
half a dozen .
oh , wait , wait , wait , wait .
slow down . hold on , now .
remember , that when you get over your target ...
&quot; a city boy , &quot; my ass . take a look at that sucker .
how many did mcgarrett get on his first try , you say ?
half a dozen .
but i &apos;ll tell you what ...
that &apos;s three times bigger than anything he caught .
you got your phone ?
yeah ...
take a picture and send it to him .
oh , come on . you sure you want to kick up that hornet &apos;s nest ?
oh , hell yeah , i do !
come on , just take a picture .
all right . all right .
all right . ready ?
smile .
victim &apos;s nico kone .
he &apos;s a pool man .
his boss sent him by to check on a thermostat glitch ,
but he never heard back from him ,
so he decided to swing by himself .
who are the homeowners ?
nathan and olivia cameron .
an elderly couple , semi @-@ retired .
they split time between here and seattle .
the house has been empty for over a month .
max , what do we know ?
two gunshot wounds to the thorax .
based on the body temp
and degree of coagulation in the blood pool ,
i estimate the t.o.d. to be roughly two hours ago .
the trajectory of the rounds and the position of the body
suggest that the victim was shot by somebody inside the house .
he died when he fell
and there was no effort to move the body .
there &apos;s no sign of forced entry .
door was open
and the key in the lock when his boss found him .
there &apos;s plenty of valuables for the taking ,
but nothing seems to be missing .
where &apos;d nico get the key ?
flower pot . the owner kept the key there ,
in case nico needed to get the control panel for the pool .
he also trusted him with the alarm code .
how many other people had access to this house ?
one .
a friend of the family checks in on this place
a couple times a week , when they &apos;re away .
okay , so maybe the friend , uh , mistakes nico for an intruder ,
shoots him , then panics and runs off .
maybe . but , this friend isn &apos;t really the shooter type .
she &apos;s just a kid .
dawn hatfield ,
she &apos;s a sophomore at waikiki community college .
she &apos;s never had a run @-@ in with the law .
hpd &apos;s trying to track her down now .
if she &apos;s the only other person who had access to this house
and she didn &apos;t pull the trigger ...
... who did ?
i &apos;m thinking whoever did the interior decorating .
this make sense to any of you guys ?
i &apos;ve seen similar measures taken at other crime scenes
to mask the odor of a decomposing human body .
yeah , but in this case , the body &apos;s out there .
so , what the hell was going on in here ?
neighbor said she saw a sanitation truck come by this morning ,
to empty her bin .
nothing unusual about that .
no , but when she went to pull it back up ,
it felt heavy ,
so , she looked to the side
and found a big bag of trash someone else dumped in there .
so she flagged me down , thought it might
have something to do with our murder investigation .
you ... don &apos;t ... remember me ... , do you ?
no . i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t .
pua ... kai .
pro bowl weekend last year .
i helped you crack a monster case .
oh , yeah , right ! now i remember !
i figured you would .
uh , you may also remember , we kind of had a moment .
yeah ... we did , didn &apos;t we ?
yeah , and look at you now .
you followed through and you became a cop .
graduated top third of my class .
well , i &apos;m not surprised .
you seem like a really sharp guy .
uh , mind if i ask you something ?
yeah . sure .
how do you feel about workplace romances ?
you mean like , you and me ?
i @-@ i was just wondering if you &apos;d ever consider dating a colleague .
you like sushi .
yeah . i @-@ i love sushi .
pua ...
i have a boyfriend .
scale of one to ten , how serious is it ?
ten .
look , you &apos;re a really sweet guy .
i &apos;m very flattered . i really am .
well , in @-@ in case things go sideways with mr. ten ,
i @-@ i &apos;m around ... but the offer &apos;s limited .
once i get my detective shield , i &apos;m ,
i &apos;m gonna be a pretty hot catch .
i think you already are .
now why don &apos;t you show me what you found .
hey , boss , over here .
oh , man , it stinks like paint thinner .
good nose .
acetone .
bi @-@ layered liquid , acetone .
those air fresheners were there to mask the odor of the chemicals .
looks like our vic walked in on somebody cooking crystal meth .
excuse me .
dawn hatfield ?
yeah ?
how you doing ? i &apos;m steve mcgarrett from five @-@ 0 .
is everything all right ?
yeah .
i just want to ask you a couple of questions . that okay ?
yeah .
i think i was there three days ago .
yeah , tuesday-- that was the last time i checked the house .
you sure about that ?
yeah . i &apos;m positive .
stopped by before my classes .
okay , you &apos;re really starting to freak me out .
was there like a break @-@ in or something ?
oh , my god .
that &apos;s nico . that &apos;s the camerons &apos; pool guy .
what happened ?
somebody shot him from inside of the house .
how well did you know nico ?
i mean , i didn &apos;t .
really , i mean we ...
bumped into each other a few times at the house .
can you think of anybody else that might have had access
to the key or the alarm code besides you and nico ?
no .
i don &apos;t think so .
you never took anybody to the house with you ?
no . the camerons specifically told me not to ,
so , i always went alone .
okay . all right .
the last time you were there was tuesday ?
yeah . i watered the inside plants ,
checked the thermostat , made sure everything was okay .
do you remember seeing anything unusual in the kitchen ?
no . it was spotless .
like it always is .
why are you asking me these questions ?
because last tuesday the alarm was disarmed
and it was never turned back on again .
oh , my god .
i ... i didn &apos;t reset the alarm .
that &apos;s how someone got in the house , isn &apos;t it ?
so nico &apos;s dead .
this is all my fault .
physical therapy appointment , huh ?
yeah . yeah . my mandatory hour of joy
with nurse ratchet , thanks to you .
thanks to me ?
what , you gonna blame that building collapsing on us on me ?
i am . yeah .
and how exactly am i responsible ?
well , uh ... about four years ago ,
you came and knocked on my door
and told me that i had no choice but to work with you ,
so , i figure everything terrible
that &apos;s happened to me since is your fault .
you &apos;re like a cloud , dark cloud ,
that never goes away .
do me a favor , when you see nurse ratchet , have her , uh ,
check your head while she works the rest of you over ,
&apos;cause you got some damage up there , too .
okay . you done ? amber &apos;s waiting in the car .
i got to go .
amber &apos;s waiting in the car ?
yeah . amber &apos;s waiting in the car .
that &apos;s what i said .
things must &apos;ve gone well in maui then .
they did . you look very surprised .
well , i mean ... a little surprised ,
given your propensity to blow up relationships .
my propensity to to blow up--
that &apos;s funny coming from the guy
whose girlfriend is currently awol .
awol ?
yeah .
no . i know where she is .
she &apos;s on the mainland visiting friends .
to get away from you .
go to pt .
i will .
enjoy .
thanks .
i hope it hurts .
a lot .
i love you .
love you , too .
just checked in with csu .
so , the cameron house was apparently
wiped clean of any usable prints .
fong &apos;s still processing the trash we found in the neighbor &apos;s bin .
well , if the inside of that house is any indication
of how good our shooter is at covering up his tracks ,
we &apos;re probably not going to find anything .
our perp might not be as smart as you think .
pulled some data off the wireless modem in the house .
someone logged into the wifi network multiple times
over the last three days ,
including right up until the time of the murder .
i was able to get the user from pulling an ip address .
kid named joseph son .
no priors . nothing in the system .
he &apos;s a chem major at pacific isle university .
rents an apartment two blocks from campus .
a chem major who &apos;s obviously way too smart
to cook meth in his own kitchen .
building &apos;s surrounded , joseph .
nowhere to run .
steve , he &apos;s headed for the roof .
i got him .
don &apos;t be stupid .
joseph ... it &apos;s all over .
get on your knees , put your hands behind your head ,
interlock your fingers .
no , no , don &apos;t do it , don &apos;t do it ,
don &apos;t do it !
joseph . no ! no !
so , this kid was more afraid of going to prison
than he was of dying .
i don &apos;t think so .
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time we &apos;ve seen someone
try to take the easy way out .
i &apos;m telling you , chin .
i mean , you didn &apos;t see the look in his eyes
before he jumped off that roof .
there was no fear there .
it was anger , hatred .
fong .
duke , csu find anything in son &apos;s apartment ?
just a laptop . the place was clean .
no evidence that he was using or selling drugs
or engaging in any kind of criminal activity .
and the neighbors said he was a great student .
not too many friends , pretty much kept to himself .
and nothing in our cameras
that connected him with our vic or the cameron family .
well , he chose that house for a reason .
we need to find out what that was .
hey , remember those water bottles we found in the trash ?
yeah .
according to fong , there was residue
of hydrochloric acid , sulfuric acid
and hydrogen peroxide inside of them .
hydrogen peroxide &apos;s not used in cooking meth .
that &apos;s because son wasn &apos;t cooking meth in that kitchen .
he was making a bomb .
well , ain &apos;t that cute ?
you waiting for an autographed picture
of me and that fish i caught this morning ?
no , i &apos;m not , but not bad for a guy in shallow water
with a snorkel and a spear gun .
&quot; not bad &quot; ?
yeah , you see , real fishermen , what they do
is they dive out past the jetty , first of all .
we free @-@ dive in at least 30 feet of water .
we don &apos;t use a snorkel .
we certainly don &apos;t use a fancy spear gun .
we use a , uh , hand spear .
do you know what a hand spear is ?
you ever see one of those before ?
发明了水肺型潜水器和水下使用电视的方法
well , excuse me , jacques cousteau .
you know , jealousy is an ugly cloak , my friend .
you do not wear it well .
&quot; jealousy &quot; ?
no , no , no .
look , that fish was probably old , depressed ,
you know , maybe a little , uh , senile , you know , swimming around ...
looking for a tiger shark to end his days ,
and then bumped into you .
a senile , depressed fish ?
that &apos;s right .
you are some piece of work , mcgarrett , you know that ?
all right . to what do i owe the displeasure of this visit ?
i need your help on something , lou .
all right , you got it . what is it ?
that jumper out by university ,
a kid named joseph son .
he &apos;s the suspect in the murder of the pool guy up in lanikai .
at the crime scene , we found acetone , hydrogen peroxide ,
hydrochloric and sulfuric acid .
tatp .
i &apos;m thinking he was building a bomb .
but for what ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
we checked his apartment , we checked his car .
they &apos;re both clean . no explosives .
no , no contraband .
so you think there &apos;s other players involved .
yeah , and i think there &apos;s an explosive device
out there somewhere .
listen , i got a , i got that sick feeling on this one , lou .
i can &apos;t stop thinking this is a part of something much bigger .
i need everybody you got on this .
is that son &apos;s laptop ?
yeah . i just got into some encrypted files .
it looks like son &apos;s been chatting over the internet
with a top @-@ tier al @-@ qaeda figure in yemen ,
for over a year .
here ... have a look .
穆罕默德 · 拿撒利亚
you know him ?
yeah .
that &apos;s muhammad nazaria .
he &apos;s a poster boy for the american jihadi movement .
and he grew up in a suburb in cleveland , ohio .
ivy @-@ league @-@ educated .
last i heard he was hiding
in some lawless region of yemen .
well , he may be in hiding ,
but he continues to get his message out .
the thing that worries me
is that chats between nazaria and son
stopped a few months ago ,
after this last exchange .
&quot; joseph , you must remain strong . &quot;
&quot; the very definition of jihad is to fight against
and destroy the infidels . &quot;
&quot; once you &apos;ve chosen this path of righteousness ,
you can never abandon it . &quot;
and then son responds : &quot; you have shown me
i have the heart of a lion . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m prepared to sacrifice my life on this earth
for the good of our noble jihad
until our way is the way of life for all people . &quot;
it &apos;s pretty clear
from reading the exchanges over the last year
that nazaria has slowly indoctrinated son
into his own radical way of thinking .
well , american kids like joseph son ,
becoming radicalized terrorists
is @-@ is one of the intel community &apos;s biggest fears .
so , customs has son taking two trips to yemen
over the past 18 months .
he was traveling on a student visa issued through the university .
now , i had tsa pull the manifests
from all of his flights ,
to see if he was traveling with someone .
sure enough , he was .
this kid--
brian miller , he was with son on every single one of
his flights to and from yemen .
same as son . no criminal history .
and no known ties to any terrorist organizations
that would put him on the radar with dhs or the fbi .
all right , look , tatp is cheap ,
it &apos;s easy to make ,
there &apos;s how @-@ to videos all over the internet .
it &apos;s possible these kids are lone wolves ,
inspired by nazaria ,
and planning some kind of attack of their own .
move ! get down !
i &apos;m good ! i got you guys covered .
lou , you okay ? lou ?
perimeter is secure .
10 @-@ 4 . we have a least 2 bogies--
one on the ground floor , one on the second floor .
look at that .
lucky twice in one day .
copy , two bogies .
you know , only you can see getting shot
as being lucky .
you stay down until i can get you out of here .
that ain &apos;t happening .
it &apos;s over , miller ! there &apos;s no way out !
moving in ! cover me !
throw down your weapon , come out with your hands up !
he &apos;s done .
got movement !
go , go , go , go , go , go !
give me your hands .
oh , so you surf ,
you kill people and you make bombs , huh ?
you &apos;re a real renaissance woman .
i don &apos;t think you get it , dawn .
this is the major leagues , right ?
this is your life , right here in this room .
right now . this is it .
okay , anything , anything else happens
as a result of those explosives ,
anybody else gets hurt ,
anybody else dies ,
you &apos;re gonna pay for this for the rest of your life .
you understand what i &apos;m saying to you ?
do you want to end this ?
you can end this , right now .
you tell me where those explosive devices are ,
we end this right here , right now .
you think you scare me ?
you think i &apos;m afraid ?
go ahead and beat me .
torture me .
do whatever you like .
because you &apos;ll never get in my head .
steve ...
we got something .
get her over to the palace .
we &apos;re not done .
look what we found .
this is no small @-@ time , lone wolf operation .
no .
they were gearing up for a war .
all right , so we know that son , miller and dawn hatfield
were planning an attack on hickam air force base .
it &apos;s what we don &apos;t know that worries me .
look at this : russian @-@ style military weapons , 100 g &apos;s in cash ?
somebody had to be backing these kids .
fbi &apos;s running the three of them , looking for
any connections they may have to players here or overseas .
and hpd and dhs are stepping up security
all across the islands ,
especially at military and government installations .
do @-@ it @-@ yourself bomb @-@ making instructions .
nice touch .
the lab is running handwriting comparisons to the samples
that we recovered from son , miller and the girl-- no match .
i think we have to assume the worst and operate
as if whoever drew up these instructions
are still right here on the ground on o &apos;ahu .
yeah , and that there might be other cells out there
waiting to strike .
all right , lookit , the military sends all ieds used
in attacks against coalition forces
to an fbi warehouse near quantico .
they also keep a library of documents recovered
from raids on al @-@ qaeda and taliban safe houses .
okay , i &apos;ll get everything we have and send it over to them .
let &apos;s see if we can match the designs of these devices
or the handwriting in these documents to anyone they may have
in their database-- see if we can find these kids &apos; partner .
the symbionese liberation army ...
the bla ... the united freedom front ...
you know what all these groups have in common , dawn ?
they all attacked their own country and they all lost .
their soldiers were either killed
or sent to prison .
you understand what i &apos;m trying to tell you ?
this little jihad or whatever it was you had going--
it &apos;s over , it &apos;s finished , okay ?
it &apos;s history .
the only thing left for you right now is to save yourself .
now , i know you weren &apos;t acting alone .
i know that you had help .
i want names .
while you &apos;re thinking about that , why don &apos;t you
do me a favor and help me understand something ?
help me understand how somebody like you ,
a smart , standout high school athlete from seattle ,
born in the greatest nation on earth ,
turns against her own people ?
you ... are not my people .
who are your people ?
&quot; allah has cursed the unbelievers
and proposed for them a blazing hell ! &quot;
you should have it now .
got it .
good news is these instructions are fairly detailed .
and the arabic dialect used in some of the writing
联调局总部 恐怖组织爆炸装置分析中心
联调局总部 恐怖组织爆炸装置分析中心
is unique to the hazara region of afghanistan .
okay , that should narrow it down a bit .
i can get even more specific .
this is definitely designed to be a roadside bomb .
tatp used to initiate the charge ,
c @-@ 4 used as the explosive ,
and the combination of nails , ball bearings and gravel
projectiles make it very unique .
okay , so you &apos;ve seen this before .
ieds like this have been used in the area around kandahar
over last couple of years .
that &apos;s where i &apos;ll start looking in the database .
okay , thanks .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
there was enough hardware in that house
to make three bombs , dawn .
why don &apos;t you tell me your plan ?
maybe detonate an ied on the road leading
into the air force base ?
wipe out some innocent soldiers , then what ,
a couple of secondary devices to shred up the first responders ?
that sound about right ?
&quot; innocent &quot; soldiers ?
they drop bombs thousands of feet in the air ,
killing innocent women and children like cowards !
cowards ?
you want to talk about cowards ?
you should have said so .
okay , let &apos;s talk about cowards .
why don &apos;t we start with your boy nazaria , your mentor ?
let &apos;s start with him . where is he ?
he &apos;s hiding ...
in a cave in the mountains of yemen .
you think that traitor cares about you ?
you think that piece of garbage gives a damn that your friends
are dead and that you &apos;re gonna spend the rest
of your god @-@ forsaken life rotting in some federal prison ?
muhammed nazaria is a warrior ,
he &apos;s a soldier of god ,
pursuer of the truth and the light , okay ?
he is the leader !
leaders lead from the front .
and i don &apos;t see him , do you ?
where is he ?
don &apos;t you get it , dawn ?
they found you , okay ?
because they look for people like you .
they look for people who are vulnerable ,
people who are emotionally fragile ,
who have a big wound on the inside ,
who are trying to get back at somebody for something .
and they make you feel like you &apos;re an important part of something , a cause ...
a cause bigger than you .
so big , in fact , that it &apos;s worth giving your life for .
i am a soldier of allah , and we must fight you as you fight us .
those of us that believe must fight in the cause of god !
what are you talking about ?
these words that are coming out of your mouth ,
they &apos;re not even your words !
they &apos;re phrases that have been cherry @-@ picked from a holy book
and tailored to fit the lies they &apos;ve told you .
listen to me , all right ?
i get that it was rough growing up ,
your mom was alcoholic , your old man , he was never around ,
i get it . how old were you when he died ?
you were , like , eight or nine , right ?
i lost my old man , too .
i know what it &apos;s like to lose a parent .
i didn &apos;t lose him .
he died , okay ? he died fighting your imperialistic war
against the peaceful children of allah !
you &apos;re wrong .
your dad was a hero , okay ?
he was a patriot ,
a soldier fighting for his country , dawn .
you gotta remember him .
what would he make of all this ?
you gotta know ,
somewhere inside you , that this is wrong .
some shred of regret .
my only regret is that you stopped me .
yo ... your friend at quantico &apos;s got something you should see .
all right .
so the fbi matched the evidence we sent
to two devices used in two separate bombing incidents .
one of those devices targeted a u.s. military convoy
traveling down a highway outside of kandahar , in june 2012 .
we lost four marines that day .
there was one survivor , marine sergeant kirk emerson .
he survived , but he lost parts
of both legs and an arm in the attack .
he &apos;s recovering in a va hospital in san diego .
now , the ied that was used was processed by the fbi
as soon as it hit the warehouse , because it was used
in a fatal attack on our soldiers .
right . the components were too fried ,
so couldn &apos;t get any dna or fingerprints .
right .
in november of 2012 , an army eort recovered
an identical device buried on the side of the same highway
leading into kandahar .
that bomb failed to detonate , it was recovered intact
and then sent to quantico for processing .
and ?
well , because it wasn &apos;t involved in a fatal attack ,
it was set in backlog ,
waiting processing until right now .
but the fbi thinks they may have found some usable prints .
okay , we got several good lifts off the device .
we also got a hit in the immigration database .
their faces should be showing up on your screen in a second .
according to tsa ,
these two arrived on your island
18 months ago as legal refugees from kandahar , afghanistan .
hold on . these animals just walk into our country ?
they come through the front door ?
immigration granted them refugee status last year .
well , how does that happen ?
because until you pointed us
in the direction of that ied in backlog ,
we had no evidence linking
these men to any militant activities or terrorist groups .
they live a couple miles from the base .
well , we got the students .
let &apos;s go get the teachers .
come on , mika ! go get &apos; em !
move your feet , mika !
shoot it !
shoot it !
yes ! good play ! excellent play !
police ! out of the way !
uday jahani !
get down on the ground !
get down on the ground now !
put your hands behind your head . turn around .
on your knees . turn around .
you &apos;re under arrest .
stand up .
rahim ahad ! get down on your knees !
on your knees !
i said get down !
hands behind your back .
you &apos;re under arrest ...
for the murder of four american servicemen in afghanistan
and for conspiracy to commit acts of terror
against the united states of america .
get up .
take a good look .
this is what your last seconds of freedom look like .
they wanted to stay loyal to the cause ,
but they &apos;re nowhere near as loyal as their star pupil .
you see , these men , they got families ,
they got kids they want to see again .
so , uh ...
they gave everything up .
the plan to bomb the air force base ,
the network leading back to yemen ,
the money trail--
they even gave up nazaria &apos;s safe house .
it &apos;s all over .
the only thing i need out of you , dawn ...
is why .
i understand why these guys hate us .
from the day they were born ,
they &apos;ve been bred to believe that we are the enemy .
but you ...
with the opportunities and the freedoms
that you were born with , with the life ...
you think you know me .
but you know nothing about me .
i know that your dad was probably your last chance ,
and when he died , you lost your way .
you &apos;re pretty proud of yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
brian and joseph are dead .
you &apos;ve got me in a cage , wrapped up neatly in a bow .
do you think we &apos;re the only ones ?
we &apos;re not .
there are many more like me .
we &apos;re your neighbors .
we serve your coffee ,
wash your cars ...
and we will never stop fighting
until every single person who walks this earth
accepts islam and all the wonders of god .
that &apos;s never gonna happen .
not in this country , anyway ,
because for every one of you ,
there &apos;s a thousand of me .
and just like you ,
we &apos;re willing to die for the cause , too .
and no matter what you do ,
no matter how hard you come at us ,
you will never change the way we think
and you will never , ever ...
change the way we live .
you wanted to sacrifice your life for the cause , right ?
congratulations .
you just did .
thank you .
dawn hatfield is being charged with murder
and criminal conspiracy . she &apos;s looking at life @-@ plus .
couldn &apos;t have happened to a nicer lady .
she &apos;ll have plenty of time to come to her senses .
do me a favor . you hear me
complain about my pt ever again ,
i want you to punch me in the head .
okay .
good job .
excuse me .
kirk emerson ?
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
this is danny williams .
hey , man .
we &apos;re with the five @-@ o task force in hawaii .
you are a long way from home , man .
what can i help you with ?
help us ? no , uh ...
you &apos;ve , uh ... you &apos;ve done enough .
what ? this ? nah .
i &apos;m just doing my job , man .
call it a bad day at the office .
kirk , we &apos;ve got some news for you
that we , uh , we felt you deserved to hear in person .
yesterday , we broke apart
a terror plot on the island of oahu .
it was targeting american soldiers stationed at hickam air force base .
i heard about that .
it &apos;s been all over the news .
yeah . well , we did withhold some information
&apos;cause we wanted to tell you something personally .
the two afghan nationals that we put away ...
they &apos;re the same two men
who attacked your convoy in afghanistan ,
wounded you and killed your buddies .
you have no idea what that means .
for you to come all this way and tell me that in person .
look , we know it &apos;s not gonna bring your friends back .
we know that .
but ... we were hoping
maybe it &apos;d help you sleep at night a little better ,
knowing that the men responsible are ...
they &apos;re going to finally pay for what they did .
how do you say &quot; thank you &quot; in hawaiian ?
mahalo .
mahalo .
no thanks necessary . we &apos;re just doing our job .
you can call this one a good day at the office ,
i think , right ?
semper fi .
okay , look , this is
my fracture two weeks ago and this is it today .
see the difference ?
ooh . nice rack , bruddah .
what do you mean ?
ribs . nice .
oh . right .
everything &apos;s about food with you
not a lot of meat on that bone though , huh ?
so you , too , with the food .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s odd .
if there ever is a planetary famine ,
please remind me not to be near these two .
thanks a lot for inviting me .
pua , you know this is not a date , right ?
we &apos;re just friends .
that &apos;s cool .
uh , i mean i was wondering if you had a cousin ...
you know , someone who kind of looks like you ?
exactly like you ?
no .

mmm ! have mercy .
will you look at my fish ? mm @-@ hmm !
she sure does clean up nice , don &apos;t she ?
she sure does .
well , uh , listen , ladies and gentlemen ,
before we dig in , i &apos;d just like to take the time
to say a few words about my , uh ...
worthy opponent .
here we go .
to become so strong and mighty ,
you spent many years
in the depths of the ocean ,
avoiding the nets of the trawlers ,
dodging the fisherman &apos;s spear ...
did you write this ?
no , this is all him .
that &apos;s good , i like it . keep going .
you were not one to be fooled by the baited hook
or by shiny lure , oh , no .
you knew no fear ,
for you were king of the sea ...
that is , until that fateful moment yesterday ,
when you swam around that reef and found
yourself looking deeply into the eyes of a mighty warrior .
stop . stop there .
we &apos;re done , we &apos;re bored , we &apos;re hungry .
pass the damn fish around the table .
i &apos;m not bored .
fine , fine .
let &apos;s eat . let me get a littleof this first ... i got it .
it &apos;s like liquid . it &apos;s just ...
just @-@ just melts in your mouth .
i just ... mmm !
there-- move that around in your mouth .
how you like that ?
how &apos;s that taste ? you know what ?
it tastes like a suicidal fish
who gave his life to pump up your ego .
yeah , you &apos;re just gonna keep right on
flogging that dead horse .
i &apos;m just keeping it real , man .
real ?
let me tell you what &apos;s real , partner .
