that was easy .
i did it .
all by myself .
oh , smithers , do you always have to be underfoot ?
sorry , sir .
if there were a less spectacular
way to save your life , i ...
i should &apos;ve found it .
* you see this guy *
* this guy is in love with you *
mr. burns , coming down , i ...
i thought we weren &apos;t gonna make it ,
and i thought i &apos;d never get to say something
i &apos;ve always wanted to .
the truth is , sir , i &apos;m in love with ...
the sound of your own voice ?
yes , well , no doubt would i ,
listening to the nightingale trill her unending tune .
don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but you mean nothing to me .
someone i give less thought to than the little piece
of popcorn stuck in my tooth .
ooh , can you remove it ?
i &apos;ll see you back at the office . don &apos;t be late .
* i have lived half of my life *
* living half of a life *
* waiting for you to 34 *
* can &apos;t you see the fire burning in my core *
* is there a half life for hope *
* i know the answer is &quot; nope &quot; *
* i failed at my mission *
* no fusion , just fission *
* and now i &apos;m here wishing to be decomissioned *
* have you ever felt down *
* much worse than a meltdown *
* my heart is covered in burns *
larry , moe and curly , get out here now !
so , you like fun and games ?
well , games can be fun , so , uh , that &apos;s kind of redundant .
would you like to rethink the question ?
here &apos;s a game for you--
properly stack and store those rods ,
then perform a complete turbine
maintenance procedure .
routine maintenance ?
we never do that .
lots of us never get to do things .
yeah , we know .
we heard your song .

yeah , yeah , smart . yes .
i can &apos;t fight it anymore .
i ran away from you once .
i can &apos;t do it again .
strange choices .
maybe that scrunchie &apos;s too tight .
well , you can teach acting .
you can &apos;t teach popular .
we &apos;ve got our ilsa .
are you sure ? even by school play standards ,
she &apos;s terrible .
skinner , i &apos;m setting down my clipboard
to signify that all future auditions
are just a formality .
lisa simpson , reading for the part of ilsa .
the egghead ?
pass . hard pass .
can i tell you a story ?
it &apos;s about a girl
who came to paris and met a man ,
a very great and courageous man .
she &apos;s good .
yes , better than little miss print shop ...
and there you are .
guess what , you &apos;ve just been promoted a grade .
everything she knew or ever became
was because of him .
and she looked up to him and worshipped him
with a feeling she supposed was love .
that &apos;s it !
i &apos;ll audition for rick .
co @-@ stars are always fall in love .
brad and angelina , kermit and miss piggy ,
mrs. brady and greg .
the role of ilsa goes to lisa .
yes !
the role i was anagrammed to play .
and since only one child
auditioned for the lead role ...
i am proud to announce rick will be played by ...
i &apos;m looking for a down @-@ on @-@ his @-@ luck heel named skinner .
who are you ?
name &apos;s jack deforest ,
and of all the schools in all the districts ,
i had to get transferred to this one .
you &apos;ve got the part .
well , that fills out the cast .
milhouse , you &apos;re the understudy .
understudy ?
both those words are horrible .
hey guys , my , uh , head &apos;s a little wet
from the decontamination shower .
thanks .
de nada .
let &apos;s see how that thing &apos;s working .
not again !
bring it back , get it working ,
screw it on tight .
both screws ?
yes .
he &apos;s chewing our ass &apos; cause he &apos;s unhappy .
what are we gonna do here ?
i know the answer .
we have got to get that guy a woman .
a woman who can find him a man .
okay , guys , to get smithers off our backs ,
i &apos;m gonna find him a boyfriend on this .
homer , i &apos;m a long @-@ haul trucker ,
who &apos;s home @-@ straight and highway @-@ gay ,
but , uh , how do you know about grinder ?
my wife put me on to it .
i was looking for an app for pepper grinders ,
and i found this .
uh , doesn &apos;t smithers dig burns ?
yeah , but burns doesn &apos;t want smithers .
isn &apos;t it sad , marge , when somebody really ,
really , really , really wants somebody ,
and they &apos;re sitting across the bar from you married to homer ?
moe , this is why i don &apos;t come here much .
oh , yeah , you &apos;re right , marge .
hey , uh , i &apos;m sorry .
oh , yeah .
can we just find a boyfriend for smithers ?
finally , a use for the internet .
no .
no .
too smoldering .
too lumberjack .
too &quot; look how fun i am . &quot;
george takei ?
click me and we will boldly go to yogurtland ,
i don &apos;t care for people who cling on .
hey , why am i on this ?
well , only one way to find out .
swipe .
maybe we should just invite them all to a party
and see who mr. smithers likes .
good idea .
did somebody here swipe me ?
here &apos;s five bucks .
visit my dad . say you &apos;re me .
finally , i &apos;m paid to act .
tell you what ,
if you buy a half @-@ page ad in the program ,
sam plays &quot; as time goes by &quot; with hulk hands .
you have a deal .
i &apos;m glad someone &apos;s getting something from this play .
as an understudy , all i get is to watch
lisa and jack fall in love .
oh , you &apos;re still here .
look , milhouse , if anything happens
to that kid playing rick ...
you get the part .
if you catch my drift .
you know i can &apos;t catch .
don &apos;t judge me .
jack , you &apos;re amazing .
you &apos;re blowing away everyone else in the play .
you despise me , don &apos;t you ?
if i gave you any thought ,
i probably would .
i &apos;ll be in my trailer .
this isn &apos;t fiji water .
yo , dingus , someone doesn &apos;t want you in that play .
who let you three gorillas out of the zoo ?
gorillas .
it &apos;s not funny .
how &apos;d you get the bullies
to take out jack ?
the most powerful bribe in the world
a free full @-@ page ad in the play program .
道夫 金宝 卡尼
it &apos;s a funny thing about fists , everyone gets them ,
but not everyone gets the instruction manual .
oh , no ,
his mouth wrote checks , his fists could cash !
someone is using the go @-@ round
for non @-@ merry purposes .
attention .
in casablanca , the part of rick blaine
will now be played by milhouse .
also , the cafeteria is out of buns ,
so for hamburgers we will now be using
two slices of day @-@ old toast .
that is all .
&quot; where you &apos;re going , i can &apos;t ... &quot;
line !
&quot; follow ! &quot;
sounds weird to me .
&quot; i can &apos;t follow . &quot;
&quot; i can &apos;t follow . &quot;
also ,
why would nazis respect letters of transit signed by de gaulle ?
i may be pulling on a thread , but hear me out ...
everything looks great , marge .
that cheese is cubed perfectly .
thank you .
i get queasy when i see cubes that are cut on the bias .
oh , mr. smithers .
come in , come in , come in .
can i get you a tom collins ?
hello , tom collins .
hmm , i see what &apos;s going on here .
fix up your boss ,
so he won &apos;t be so hard on you .
well , nice try .
i want a vodka tonic , and then i &apos;m gonna leave .
mr. collins ,
would you be charmed by horror stories of working with bill shatner ?
uh , who ?
i like you already .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t think that attitude is the real you .
i believe you have a pinched nerve in your neck ,
and guess what ?
you &apos;re in luck , because i give great massage .
sorry , not interested .
how did you do that ?
would you like to discuss that
over peruvian tapas ?
simpson , i &apos;m stealing your bartender .
take the next couple days off .
three day bender !
are there any gay @-@ themed songs about celebrating ?
忽略
did you used to jog with monty ?
mm , sort of .
smithers , where have you been ?
i &apos;m dictating my autobiography .
chapter one , a commotion at the telegraph office .
i &apos;m afraid i have other plans .
there are no other plans .
now take my picture for the back cover .
no , sir , i don &apos;t think i will .
in fact , what i &apos;m going to do is ...
quit !
my god , i did it .
i actually quit .
no one quits me .
one more button .
you &apos;re forgetting who installed this system .
ahoy @-@ hoy !
so , you want time off for your sister &apos;s funeral ?
miss naegle ,
release the hounds .
wh @-@ what do you mean ?
send vicious dogs to rip him to shreds .
but wouldn &apos;t i be criminally liable ?
i said release !
release , release !
that sounds vaguely sexual .
i &apos;m gonna have to file a grievance .
also , let &apos;s just see how you &apos;ve been treating those hounds .
what the ...
okay , we &apos;re gonna have to shut this all down .
you know , he doesn &apos;t give me health insurance ...
and i , uh , i think i have rabies .
okay , that &apos;s it , mr. burns .
i &apos;m gonna need to speak
to your head of human resources .
it &apos;s this guy .
what are you doing ?
sorry . i used to do that for mr. burns .
ah , forget about burns .
ancient @-@ a history .
i left @-@ a the italy 40 years ago ,
but do you see me @-@ a crying
in my pappardelle rustiche con salsiccia e porri ?
waylon , just what did you see in him ?
now to set her down gently on the golf course .
you &apos;re right , totally .
i &apos;m here for you .
listen , i &apos;m making a trip to cuba , okay ?
my homeland , where my accent
is not so rediculous .
come with me to havana .
w @-@ wait a minute .
i &apos;m ... not sure .
but this is the route we &apos;re gonna take .
oh , what the hell ,
this is gonna be the time of my life .
i &apos;m in !
milhouse is the worst actor i &apos;ve ever seen ,
and i have to play opposite him !
he &apos;s so bad .
look at his headshot .
whenever i &apos;m dealing with someone
who isn &apos;t doing a great job ,
what i do is treat them like they &apos;re perfect .
really ?
if they sense you believe in them ,
they &apos;ll get better .
did our taxes , marge .
the government owes us $ 2 million .
that is really , really great ,
but maybe you should check again .
what ?
oh , i ... my mistake .
we owe them $ 37 .
that &apos;s some nice adding .
yeah .
i &apos;ve done it .
i &apos;m happy .
i &apos;m in a new world
and completely forgotten about ...
what , the buzzard of death ?
it reminds you of him !
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
you address me like i am him .
everything reminds you of him !
i bet that mural of him
being driven out of cuba in 1959
reminds you of him !
waylon , i am a man who needs 100 % commitment , okay ?
okay , well , maybe not 100,
but at least , like , 20 , you know ,
which is the percentage that your cell phone needs
to stay in the green .
so tell me now , waylon .
am i in the green ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
beneath this mask i am crying .
everyone who &apos;s replaced smithers
has been nothing but trouble .
you &apos;re my lawyers , tell me what to do .
sir , i think your only option is to get mr. smithers back .
you &apos;ll have to give him money .
lots of money , but it won &apos;t be enough .
yes . ...
absolutely .
yes , i suppose what this calls for
is a personal apology straight from my heart .
have it on my desk first thing tomorrow ...
and write yourselves apologies from me to you
for making you work late ,
and they &apos;d better sound sincere .
明晚 a.m.幼稚园献上 《 恋马狂 》
you &apos;re going to be great .
i already am ...
because you just told me so .
thank you .
so , what brought you to casablanca ?
i came here for the waters .
there are no waters in casablanca .
i was misinformed .
is it just me or is milhouse really killing it ?
he &apos;s like a young noah wylie .
if that plane leaves the ground
and you &apos;re not with him , you &apos;ll regret it .
maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow ,
but soon and for the rest of your life .
you did it , marge .
this earns my highest praise
get through @-@ able .
milhouse , you were incredible .
maybe that &apos;s because ...
i &apos;m not milhouse .
oh , but , is milhouse okay ?
is milhouse ever okay ?
good point .
now let &apos;s go to the soda fountain
and ask the jerk for a float with two straws .
what year are you from ?
oh , who cares ?
mr. burns , mr. smithers ,
i make @-@ a something very special for your reunion .
one cheese pizza .
well , smithers , i got here
as soon as i heard you wanted to meet .
took something called uber ,
which i thought would be a wehrmacht staff car ,
but turned out to be a ...
prius , driven by a ...
woman .
now , down to business .
it &apos;s all here .
everything it &apos;ll take to get him back .
oh , no , forgot the starbucks card .
is it too late to ...
sir , before you start ,
let me say i don &apos;t want money ,
and i don &apos;t want some letter written by your lawyers .
i want to know why you want me back .
i see .
well , the thing is ,
you really care about me , don &apos;t you ?
maybe a little , still .
all right , smithers .
there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve never given you .
i kept it bottled up inside all these years
and here it is ...
your performance review .
it &apos;s ... excellent .
amazingly , that &apos;s enough .
thank you , sir .
no music !
i heard you serve 10 @-@ year @-@ olds .
that &apos;s referring to the age of the pickled eggs ,
but , uh , i &apos;ll get you a milk .
mr. smithers , why do guys do such stupid things
when it comes to dames ?
hey , you been talking to that weird bogart kid ?
he came around here trying to talk me
into an expedition to find some gold .
yeah , so i &apos;m getting the mules .
let me tell you about dames , milhouse .
i know nothing about them , but as for love ,
what keeps you going is the thrill of the chase .
the possibility that one day you might get what you want ,
even though the reality is you probably never will .
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t chase dames .
just gold .
i &apos;ll be back in six months
with one @-@ third of the biggest treasure you ever saw .
