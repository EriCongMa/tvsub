i just want to be a normal , boring couple --
i applied for a job in lincoln .
you &apos;re leaving ?
well , the interview &apos;s tomorrow .
i &apos;m flying out this afternoon .
someone with far greater access
supplied all the knowledge
required for the incursion to take place .
someone on the inside .
my house is clean . but yours ...
is not .
audrey ? hey . what are you doing here ?
did you bring me anything ?
yes .
the next name on the blacklist .
there &apos;s someone i think you should find .
he &apos;s a man who protects the guilty
by preying on the innocent .
he &apos;s killed women , children , infants if need be --
whatever the particular job calls for .
i bring this to your attention
because i &apos;ve learned that he &apos;s been contracted
to protect pytor madrczyk and his wife .
the mob informant ?
the same .
and this blacklister -- does he have a name ?
they call him the alchemist .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
why do they call him the alchemist ?
because he relies upon science
to transform one person into another .
pytor !
pytor , where am i ? ! huh ?
where am i ? ! what &apos;s going on ? ! where are you taking me ? !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
my teeth .
are we on a plane ?
yes , we &apos;re on a plane !
what the ...
pytor , is she okay ? is she dead ? !
why are you calling me &quot; pytor &quot; ? !
your passport !
i don &apos;t have a passport !
i don &apos;t like to fly ! i don &apos;t have tattoos !
who are you ?
your pilot .
better buckle up .
flight low .
flight low , flight low .
no !

the victims of the plane crash
were identified as pytor and catherine madrczyk --
ex @-@ serbian mob , turned informants .
reddington said these people were gonna disappear .
now they &apos;re burned beyond recognition .
what &apos;s his explanation ?
he hasn &apos;t given me one , sir .
so call him . get him in here .
he &apos;ll only meet off @-@ site .
he doesn &apos;t think the mole hunt ends with newton phillips .
reddington believes there &apos;s someone on the inside .
well , the d.o.j. disagrees . they &apos;re satisfied it &apos;s over .
whoever was surveilling us --
they &apos;re not working on this unit .
what i &apos;m concerned about at the moment is this case .
if this crash is not an accident ,
then i want to know what it is .
so meet with reddington . get him to talk .
here &apos;s where we are on your mole hunt .
yadin spent three days reviewing &quot; tragedy texts &quot;
between government employees
on and around the day the black site was breached .
we &apos;ve been sifting through phone calls ,
digital data -- everything .
you &apos;re burying the lead , borakove .
it &apos;s just we haven &apos;t quite ...
i mean , another week or two and
there he is .
we brought a little something for julian -- a care package .
it &apos;s a tibetan singing bowl .
what do we have here ?
some jackfruit , vitamin d , kola nuts .
but we &apos;ve got to get him to eat more protein .
he looks like hell . he isn &apos;t vegan , is he ?
anyway , i &apos;ve also included
a couple of my favorite richard pryor records .
i want to try and inject
a little levity into the proceedings .
i mean , julian looks so crabby all the time .
house arrest can be grueling .
didn &apos;t you spend , like , four months
in phonthong ?
seven .
how did you survive ?
naps . occasional calisthenics .
so , the defense fund -- where do we stand ?
well , we &apos;ve put together an amazing team ,
but it &apos;s expensive .
he &apos;s been holed up at that embassy
for , what , two years now ?
it could go on forever and cost a fortune .
i &apos;m practically bankrolling the entire defense fund as it is .
for that , i need best efforts .
surely , there &apos;s some stone you &apos;ve left unturned .
we have a man
inside a company that shreds classified documents ,
mostly private firms that do business with the government .
we &apos;ve got mountains of raw data .
it &apos;s just not worth the trouble .
not only is it impossible to reassemble ,
it &apos;s second @-@ tier intel .
put it together .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
borakove , i hate sarcasm , and i love puzzles .
i think i was followed .
you were -- by my people .
is this really necessary ?
yes . it &apos;s a sanctuary .
and until the deficit in your organization is found ,
i &apos;m keeping a low profile .
you were wrong about madrczyk .
you said the alchemist was hired to protect him .
now he &apos;s dead .
pytor madrczyk is alive .
no , he &apos;s dead .
your medical examiner has it wrong .
it &apos;s been confirmed by the lab -- dna tests .
dental prints .
yes . y @-@ you can &apos;t change dna .
well , the alchemist can .
lizzy , this man is a forensic virtuoso .
he &apos;s an artist who paints in blood and saliva samples .
human tissue is his canvas .
i &apos;m not ashamed to say
he &apos;s even better than me at helping people disappear ,
which is why madrczyk hired him and not myself .
wait . madrczyk tried to hire you ?
competition is fierce .
are you telling me that you know where he wanted to flee ?
if i tell you , you have to promise me
you &apos;ll try the fertilized duck eggs .
it &apos;s a daring and unique dining experience .
you &apos;ll think you &apos;ve died and gone to hell .
you have eyes on the target ?
target is dead .
hold tight while i look for his ghost .
my ex , audrey -- she &apos;s getting married .
she just texted me again .
wants to meet for drinks to talk about tassels .
tassels ? is that her dog ?
no , it &apos;s the guy .
he &apos;s a hedge @-@ fund guy --
pink shirt , loafers with those tassels .
anyway , the thing is ,
i got to tell her i &apos;m happy for her when i &apos;m not .
the guy &apos;s a tool .
i have eyes on him .
he &apos;s headed your way .
any sign of the wife ?
nope . it &apos;s him .
everyone in position .
officials are blaming engine failure for the plane crash that clai--
hey . you &apos;re home .
how was the job interview ?
i didn &apos;t go .
i mean , i got there , but ...
i couldn &apos;t .
because all i could think about was you ...
and your dad .
my dad ?
you know , just everything that you &apos;ve been through .
and i realized i can &apos;t put you in that position
of choosing between your career and me .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
but jeni is due in six weeks ,
and i think she &apos;s expecting us to take her baby .
i &apos;m expecting us to take her baby .
i think about it all the time .
do you ?
&apos;cause we never talk about it .
it used to be all that mattered .
i know .
i would quit my job if i could --
i know you don &apos;t believe that .
no , no .
i &apos;m not asking you to quit your job .
i just need you to be more safe and to be more present .
i can do that . i promise .
and you have so many secrets .
and i wish you didn &apos;t , because i don &apos;t have any secrets .
except one thing .
i may have watched the last &quot; real housewives &quot;
in my hotel room without you .
i know . it showed up on our netflix queue .
sorry .
i will do anything to make this easier .
yeah ? anything ?
anything .
you remember mrs. sutton ?
she wanted to throw us a baby shower ,
invite all the teachers .
please tell me she &apos;s not .
we &apos;re hosting .
we got the autopsy results back
for the male victim on the plane .
the dental plates pulled by the m.e.
were within the margin of error --
not perfect , but close enough to determine a match .
then , when they inspected the teeth themselves ,
they found they &apos;d been altered .
what do you mean , &quot; altered &quot; ?
his teeth had been surgically replaced ,
some of them filed , modified .
okay . filing teeth i get . it &apos;s strange .
but the dna ? somehow , the alchemist
got madrczyk &apos;s dna into the body of this john doe .
how does he do it ?
i don &apos;t know even half of it .
i &apos;ve heard rumors --
removing the white blood cells from the victim
and replacing them with the red blood cells of his client ,
leaving clone dna at crime scenes to mislead the police ,
even incorporating synthetic dna
into genuine human tissue .
so this isn &apos;t just evidence tampering .
this is genetic manipulation .
yes . it &apos;s a trade in death .
the guilty give their blood and genetic identity .
the innocent give their life for the guilty to live .
if you find the alchemist ,
you have a chance to resurrect the dead ,
to bring to justice some of the most ...
vile creatures who ever lived .
april 2009 --
an $ 8 billion ponzi scheme wipes out
the savings of every account holder at chariton national .
december 2011 -- seven people are found dead in a diner ,
victims of a mob hit .
two months later , the bronx d.a. files charges
on behalf of 24 teenage boys
who claimed they were molested at church .
there are more , and in each of these cases ,
investigators found perpetrators of the incidents dead .
according to reddington , they &apos;re not .
how many cases is he talking about ?
the female victim on the plane was named sarah jenkins .
how did you identify her ?
the alchemist knew that , based on a forensic procedure ,
we wouldn &apos;t run tests necessary
to distinguish between synthesized and natural dna .
now that we know what we &apos;re looking for ,
we pulled the bone @-@ marrow sample ,
ran it against our database .
jenkins was single , lived alone , but i did find this .
last time she was online was over 72 hours ago .
she visited this dating website ,
which is also where i met phyllis tugenberg ...
and her cankles .
aram , sarah jenkins -- who was she online with ?
we don &apos;t know , but we &apos;ve issued a subpoena to find out .
i got a call . are you trettel ?
we have a situation .
yeah , we have a situation .
you crashed our jet , murdered five people .
we &apos;re supposed to be gone . you assured us .
i was on my way to budapest
when my husband was taken into fbi custody .
who did you tell ?
we paid you to make us disappear .
ms. madrczyk , i need you to listen to me very carefully .
what is this place ? is this where you do the work ?
i need you to write down the names of anyone you think
might know your plans --
family , friends , anybody .
i didn &apos;t tell anybody .
i need to know the name of your husband &apos;s lawyer .
clark schroeder .
why ? are you calling him ?
please tell me you can fix --
you broke an immunity agreement ,
which means you &apos;re going to jail
unless you start talking about the alchemist .
who is he ?
got a cigarette ?
yeah , i do .
i never met the guy .
everything was done through the couriers .
gives you this -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s like a checklist .
checklist for what ? - everything --
medical and dental records , blood samples , saliva .
how much did you pay him ?
i want to talk to my wife .
tell us about the accounts he used to take payment .
we can start talking about a new deal .
attorney &apos;s here .
who are you ?
mikkelson . schroeder is en route .
moment with my client ?
how long did they have you in here before i arrived ?
where is schroeder ? he should be in here now .
i don &apos;t even know who you are .
i need to know exactly what you told him .
no , you don &apos;t . all you need to know
is how the hell you &apos;re gonna get me out of here .
that &apos;s why i have you schmucks on retainer !
all right , calm down . take a breath .
i was abducted ,
flown 4,500 miles to be put into this box !
call schroeder ! tell him to put his damn golf clubs down
and show his ass here now !
give me one of those .

sarah jenkins was using an online @-@ dating site .
that &apos;s how we think the alchemist found her .
gave him everything he needed to know
to double her as catherine madrczyk .
who was the date ? did you get a name ?
no . uh , an alias . but we got a photo .
ressler .
get a medic .
we got the unsubs photo off the dating website .
got a match from a rental @-@ car surveillance camera .
his name &apos;s eric trettel .
flunked out of med school .
falsified a degree from harvard
and used it to land a job in the human genome project .
he spun that into a career
as an expert witness specializing in dna evidence .
he testified in a case on behalf of carlos trena ,
a soldier in the d &apos;angelo crime family
facing three counts of murder one .
trettel was hired to present exculpatory dna evidence .
problem is , that evidence was falsified .
trettel was outed as a fraud and disgraced .
two weeks later , he disappeared .
it was believed either the d &apos;angelo family had him killed
or he fled to avoid indictment .
he have friends or family ?
wife and daughter in bethesda .
keen , pay the wife a visit .
ressler , find that car .
well , when &apos;s the last time you saw him ?
six years ago , after the trial .
annie was only 2 when he left .
honey , why don &apos;t you grab something to eat ?
some nuts in the kitchen ?
your daughter -- she &apos;s diabetic ?
just diagnosed .
how much does she know about her father ?
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
eric is a very dangerous man .
in his head , he thinks we &apos;re still together ,
a family .
so you &apos;re saying you &apos;ve had contact with him ?
he comes here sometimes .
he says he wants to help annie and me .
i say no , but he doesn &apos;t hear it .
he only becomes more determined .
that &apos;s what he loves about science .
it &apos;s the challenge , the way it pushes back at him .
it &apos;s the reason he spent all those hours in the lab .
what lab ?
call came in less than 20 minutes ago .
the car was completely engulfed .
the remains match the description of catherine madrczyk .
if it &apos;s her ,
i &apos;d say our guy is trying to cover his tracks .
i got something .
261729 .
we actually reached out to the germans for help .
they &apos;re the ones who designed the software .
ah , the germans .
despite the headlines ,
they &apos;re still the best at keeping an eye on their fellow man .
it works on pattern recognition .
i @-@ it scans the fragments and treats each scrap
as if it were part of a huge jigsaw puzzle --
font , color , shape , thickness of paper .
it &apos;s all analyzed and used to rebuild the original document .
you see , borakove ?
you do have a head underneath all that hair .
forget julian and his defense fund .
we have a bright future right --
lizzy , come look at this .
the boys have come up with a remarkable little game .
i really don &apos;t understand how any of it works ,
but i just love that smell the machines make .
whose garbage are you combing through now ?
yours .
shredded communications from private contractors
working with the d.o.j. , nsa , c.i.a. , fbi --
all the initials .
this is about the incursion .
when you called , you said something about numbers .
we found this in the car rented by the alchemist .
forensics ran an analysis on the paper .
it traced to a manufacturer in albany .
they produce stock for business forms .
one client stood out -- bank credit suisse zurich .
we think this is a sequence of numbers
associated with a bank account ,
maybe one used to pay the alchemist .
perhaps .
could be the combination to his gym locker .
what do you know about the man specifically ?
what is it that makes him unique ?
he &apos;s , um ...
a scientist , an expert in dna .
that &apos;s what he does .
who is he ?
he &apos;s nobody . he &apos;s a lab rat .
he &apos;s a lab rat .
audrey texted me again .
i mean , what ? is she trying to rub my nose in this thing ?
i &apos;m not giving tassels my blessing .
tassels is gonna have to wait . i think i figured this out .
come here . take a look at this .
trettel &apos;s wife told me he had this lab
in the basement , so it got me thinking .
what if that number we found in the car was from a lab ,
like , a piece of equipment , a model number , or ...
or a serial number .
hey , i want to know
who manufactures equipment used to sequence dna .
and find me the companies of the clients
that they &apos;ve sold to in the last six years .
mandy , hi .
thank you so much for calling me back .
you are perfect for this part i &apos;m casting .
i need to put you on tape for the producers .
i know it &apos;s such short notice . i &apos;m sorry .
but , um , the part does shoot tomorrow .
great .
all right , the address is 75 broadway .
remind me again why i want to be an actor .
i was just asking myself the same thing .
do you know where they moved the casting call ?
supposedly , it &apos;s not too far from here .
is it walking distance ?
want to share a cab ?
yes , thank you . that would be great .
of course .
i &apos;m jolene , nice to meet you .
three , two , one ! go !
go ! go ! go !
squash ?
no , no .
oh . carrot .
oh , i &apos;m so jealous of you right now .
i took 12 weeks with eddie . it was just ... magical .
actually , uh , liz isn &apos;t taking maternity .
why not ?
i just can &apos;t take time off my work right now .
i &apos;m still trying to convince her .
well , studies show those
first six months between mother and child
are critical to the baby &apos;s development .
that &apos;s what i keep telling her .
but , uh , we &apos;re figuring it out .
what &apos;s to figure out ?
what did you want me to say ?
you made it sound like it was all my decision .
because is , liz .
what ?
no ! we talked about this !
i &apos;m not asking you to be holly homemaker , liz !
it &apos;s not unreasonable to me that you might want to spend
some time with our child at home .
then would it be unreasonable for me to think
you might want to do the same thing ?
how about you stay at home ?
i &apos;ve taken time , liz . you sound so selfish right now .
okay ! uh ... so -- so , here &apos;s the thing --
i @-@ i was not digging through your medicine cabinet .
i was waiting for you guys to finish arguing ,
but it just sort of -- it just got kind of weird for me .
and i &apos;m also mildly claustrophobic . hi . i &apos;m jolene .
liz .
um , sorry . tom .
you &apos;re subbing for mr. sinnard , right ?
yes .
yes , sir . yep .
i &apos;m sorry you had to hear all that .
ah , please . that was nothing .
keen .
i &apos;ll be right there .
&quot; selfish . &quot;
bad move .
you &apos;re gonna pay for that one .
yeah .
don &apos;t worry .
this will all be over very , very soon .
any word from , uh , liz ?
i told you &quot; selfish &quot; was a bad idea .
now you &apos;re the bad guy .
look , it &apos;s not as bad as it sounds , all right ?
she &apos;s under a lot of pressure from work
and , you know , getting ready to have a baby .
so stop being such a downer .
look , you want to fix your marriage ,
y @-@ you got to show her a good time .
i don &apos;t think i asked for your advice .
okay , smartass . what &apos;s your plan of attack ?
and if you say you are gonna make her dinner and buy her flowers ,
i will literally vomit all over this countertop .
you have to have some fun . do you like photography ?
there &apos;s this amazing photography exhibit tomorrow night .
you guys should come .
photography exhibits -- not really me and liz .
okay , she seduces married men , sleeps with them ,
and then takes a photo mid @-@ act .
wait . you know what ? i &apos;ve heard of this woman . yeah .
in fact , i @-@ i have a friend , and she took his photo .
you know one of her subjects ?
no ! are you crazy ? !
oh , my god . - what kind of woman does this , anyways --
going around , photographing herself
having sex with random strangers ?
what is that ?
actually , it &apos;s my show .
no , it &apos;s not .
yeah . it is .
really ?
it &apos;s cool .
oh , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . i , uh ...
no , i @-@ i really like photography .
i didn &apos;t know you were an artist .
i &apos;m kidding .
oh , my --
you really think i &apos;d go around , sleeping with married men ?
i &apos;m a substitute teacher .
your hunch about the numbers was right .
it wasn &apos;t an account .
we checked one of the companies that produced that particular paper stock
and found a company that produces medical equipment .
it &apos;s a serial number for a centrifuge
purchased around the same time madrczyk hired trettel .
were you able to trace the sale ?
it was corporate -- an llc called medtech horizons .
they specialize in dna @-@ sequencing research .
time to pay a visit .
take a look at this .
two more rooms in the back .
everything &apos;s packed up .
he knows we &apos;re onto him .
that &apos;s why he took the risk of coming into the field office .
got madrczyk , his wife --
the guy &apos;s killing everybody that might lead us to him .
oh , my god . his family .
two victims .
gunshots at close range .
it &apos;s not pretty .
malik , we &apos;re too late .
molly and annie trettel are dead .
hey ! i &apos;m sorry i missed you this morning .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i got in late last night . i didn &apos;t want to wake you .
look , about last night --
i totally overreacted .
i get that you don &apos;t understand my decision ,
and i know that &apos;s hard .
we should talk about that .
i want to hear what you have to say .
let &apos;s carve out some time just for us tonight .
yeah --
uh , actually , one of the teachers mentioned this , uh ,
photography exhibit .
what if i countered with dinner at home ? i &apos;ll cook .
why would you want to punish me twice ?
okay , compromise -- you cook .
i &apos;ll grab dessert ?
please , tom , let me make this right .
all right .
you got yourself a date .
great . love you .
you too .
the hard drives we found at trettel &apos;s lab --
where are we on the data recovery ?
we had a few corrupted sectors ,
but i found something interesting -- dna panels --
several , actually .
we had already identified sarah jenkins
as the woman who died on that plane ,
but i think now we &apos;ve also got the name of madrczyk &apos;s stand @-@ in ,
as well as the pilots .
there are multiple case files here --
photos of the victims while they were sedated ,
genetic breakdowns ,
medical and dental records -- probably all from old clients .
how many more did you find ?
a dozen or so . but i &apos;m sure more will turn up
by the time i &apos;ve reconstructed the whole drive .
what is it ?
molly and annie trettel are alive .
the victims at the trettel house --
i want autopsies done immediately .
i &apos;m not interested in cause of death .
i want bone marrow drawn , tissue samples pulled .
and if it isn &apos;t them ?
then this is an abduction .
put an amber alert on the girl .
get pictures of trettel and his wife to the media ,
any news outlet that will pick up the phone .
i called you as soon as i could .
ravi actually caught it ,
noticed the document referenced the address you gave us ,
and we thought it might be worth pointing out .
blow it up .
attractive but treacherous .
it &apos;s agent keen .
excellent . print me a copy .
just out of curiosity ,
what number am i on your speed dial ?
seventh .
who &apos;s sixth ?
chinese takeout . can we come back to this later ?
i need your help .
i think eric trettel abducted his family .
tell me what you know .
two bodies at the wife &apos;s house --
a woman and a girl --
doubles for his family .
trettel -- he &apos;s a ... cipher ,
closed off from the world , shut away in his lab .
but now he &apos;s on the run .
he must be leaving some kind of trail --
bank records , uh , wiring money to his new identity .
you don &apos;t have time for that .
go back to the wife and daughter .
he &apos;s not alone anymore .
you have to look to their lives in order to find him .
they &apos;re the ones that matter . they are his vulnerability .
the wife -- she &apos;s a nurse , single mom .
the daughter -- she &apos;s sick . diabetic .
there you are .
annie trettel has an insulin pump .
pull her medical records .
i want the make and model .
how does that help us ?
some new medical devices operate using radio frequencies .
if i could ping a signal ,
i may be able to access it ,
and we could ...
locate her using the insulin pump .
annie trettel &apos;s medical records .
pump manufactured by zetak industries .
do we have a serial number ?
alpha 479 delta dash 936 zed .
come along , dear .
i got a hit --
signal emanating from a location nearly 70 miles from here .
contact local law enforcement and have them tie
those coordinates to an address .
trettel does not leave that location .
you &apos;re not gonna get away with this .
the people in your house don &apos;t just look like you .
they are you .
i took samples from your shower drain , toothbrushes ,
annie &apos;s cord blood ,
so they have your dna .
and that &apos;s all the cops need .
hey , baby . what are you thinking , huh ?
you want a candy bar ?
are you nuts ? she &apos;s diabetic .
we have to go .
mommy , look . i &apos;m on tv .
put the phone down !
i said put the phone down !
get in the car !
drop it , or i &apos;ll shoot !
god !
what ?
help !
annie ? !
annie !
no ! no , no , no , no ! hey ! look at me !
you &apos;re gonna be all right .
okay , you &apos;re gonna-- you &apos;re gonna be all right !
special agent ressler and keen .
suspect &apos;s name is eric trettel .
we &apos;re pursuing him as part of a federal investigation .
well , your federal investigation has barricaded himself inside .
i &apos;ve got a team on standby ready to move in and snipers in place .
we get a visual , i will take him out .
absolutely not . the suspect has information we need .
he &apos;s got multiple hostages in there .
i need to talk to him .
then your boss better call my boss ,
because my orders are to protect those hostages at all costs .
the hell are you doing ?
i said i need to talk to him .
do not step over that perimeter , agent .
that &apos;s an order !
hello ? !
eric ? !
my name is elizabeth keen . i &apos;m an agent with the fbi .
show me your hands !
i &apos;m unarmed ! i just want to talk !
i &apos;m not talking to anyone until you send me a medic .
you injured ? !
it &apos;s my daughter ! she &apos;s been shot !
let me handle this .
you &apos;re gonna get us all killed !
shut up . you send a medic right away ,
and i can give you names-- hundreds of them --
people you think are dead , people you &apos;re gonna want to talk to .
okay , eric , that &apos;s good ! we &apos;ll talk later !
but right now , your daughter needs help !
you need to open that door .
i &apos;m not opening the door until we make a deal !
please ! she needs a doctor now !
shut the hell up ! i &apos;m getting her a doctor !
i &apos;ll get you the names , and i get full immunity
with witsec relocation for the three of us .
i can &apos;t authorize that !
but i can help save your daughter &apos;s life .
you &apos;re in control here , eric .
annie &apos;s life is in your hands .
just do what she says !
no !
this is delta one . i &apos;ve got the shot .
