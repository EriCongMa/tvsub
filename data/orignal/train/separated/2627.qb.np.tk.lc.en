stop .
somebody .
stop that kid .
get back here .
get in .
get back !
guy &apos;s nuts . tried to steal my sister &apos;s purse .
you stole the purse , jacob .
like the credit card and the pontiac .
how do you know my name ?
i &apos;m surprised you haven &apos;t stolen more ,
considering the situation with your foster home .
you know , we &apos;ve been watching you , jacob .
we may have an opportunity for you .
who are you ?
w @-@ what is this ?
according to our research ,
you have some remarkable talents .
you want the purse ? take the purse .
you ever stop to think that the reason
you have trouble relating to other people
is because you &apos;re special ?
that it &apos;s not you , it &apos;s everyone else that &apos;s the problem ?
that &apos;s not what social services says .
good old social services --
bureaucrats trained in missing the point .
we believe that your delinquent inclinations
are exactly what makes you ... invaluable .
it takes a certain kind of courage .
what are you talking about -- a job , a school ?
what is all this stuff ?
i told you , we have an opportunity ,
if you &apos;re willing to take it --
if you &apos;re smart enough to take it .
it &apos;s your choice , jacob .
you can get out
and go back to the life you &apos;ve always known ,
or you can take a ride with me ,
and i can tell you how to leave this life behind .
i can help you become anything .
hey . aram said you were looking for me .
come in . close the door .
what &apos;s going on ?
an assistant u.s. attorney here in d.c.
has impaneled a grand jury .
he &apos;s looking into the death of lieutenant eugene ames .
a former harbormaster .
i just got off the phone with detective wilcox .
we discussed the target of his investigation .
you .
apparently , you encountered the victim
the day he disappeared --
drew down on the man , fed him some story
about searching for fugitives out of cumberland prison .
there were no fugitives .
no .
when wilcox confronted you , you changed your story .
said you were there on official business .
they even had a witness , but the guy recanted .
now agent cooper &apos;s been subpoenaed
to corroborate your story .
they want to ask him under oath if you &apos;re lying .
we all know that you weren &apos;t at that marina
in your official capacity as a member of this task force .
so , you want to tell me why the hell you were there ?
i can &apos;t .
you &apos;re the target of a federal murder investigation .
you really think the best choice at this point is to shut me out ?
you &apos;re right . i didn &apos;t tell wilcox the truth .
but i am telling you the truth when i say i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
look , meera was dead . you were in the hospital .
i did what i thought was necessary to stop berlin .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m willing to say .
you &apos;ll say far less than that , agent keen .
i &apos;ve filed a motion to quash the subpoena .
only 41 people know this task force exists .
i will not risk further exposure , not by this .
you &apos;d better hope this motion works , agent keen ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m telling you now , if they put me under oath ,
i will not commit perjury to protect you .
oh , sorry , man .
martin ! martin . come on .
i told you -- denner sits at 9 : 00 .
i know . i know . i got everything .
okay , look .
i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re walking into here .
it &apos;s no small thing to indict an active federal agent .
i &apos;m on to something . she &apos;s guilty .
denner is the perfect guy to hear this , okay ?
he &apos;s former criminal defense attorney ,
former berkeley law professor .
and he &apos;s a staunch proponent of government transparency .
well , that &apos;s promising .
we &apos;re going to five ?
yeah . they switched the courtroom .
mr. martin , detective .
step over to the checkpoint , please .
where the hell is everybody ?
what -- what is this ?
i &apos;ll need you to surrender your mobile devices ,
anything that you have that can be used
to record today &apos;s proceedings --
laptops , pens , tablets .
you -- you want my pens ?
this is crazy .
this will only take a moment .
i &apos;m afriad i &apos;ve been doing this for a while ,
but this is certainly a first .
not only did you switch my courtroom , you closed it .
and then you closed the entire floor .
my apologies , your honor ,
but i trust the measures we &apos;ve taken
will indicate how seriously we take this proceeding
and the threat it poses to our national security .
so indicated .
that said , i fail to understand
how a routine grand jury investigation
into a local homicide
justifies a dog @-@ and @-@ pony show of such dramatic proportions .
there &apos;s nothing routine about this matter , your honor .
on behalf of the justice department ,
i &apos;m here to ask the court to quash the subpoena
issued to assistant director cooper
without delay .
for national security reasons , yes -- such as ?
oh , come on , ms. wright .
don &apos;t i even get a ballpark ?
&quot; to insulate covert intelligence capacities &quot; ?
&quot; to protect an informant in an active operational zone &quot; ?
with respect , i don &apos;t appreciate your sarcasm , your honor .
really ?
well , here &apos;s what i don &apos;t appreciate , counsel .
i don &apos;t appreciate being instructed
as to what will or will not happen in my courtroom .
your honor , if i may ...
a citizen of this district has been brutally murdered --
not just a citizen , but a public servant ,
a lieutenant for the metro p.d.
and the people have a right to access
and evaluate all evidence --
no , they don &apos;t .
we have a fundamental right
we are here as a courtesy .
to seek justice ...
... and we shouldn &apos;t have to take the government &apos;s word
for the fact that national security might be involved .
it &apos;s our call to make .
we &apos;re not asking for a second opinion .
you &apos;re protecting a federal agent .
mr. markin , control your witness .
i have a good @-@ faith basis
to believe that agent keen is involved --
marty .
it &apos;s a cover @-@ up .
enough .
okay , ms. wright . i take your point .
somebody has to make the call
as to what does or does not rise to the level
of a national security concern .
and we agree .
that call should not be made by the people
or detective wilcox or even a grand jury .
thank you , your honor .
it &apos;s my job .
i will hear the justice department &apos;s argument
in chambers .
objection !
and if i agree that national security is endangered ,
i will quash the subpoena ,
and the investigation along with it .
you have no authority .
haven &apos;t we had enough government suppression , counsel ?
haven &apos;t we seen what happens
when government &apos;s actions go unchecked ?
now , you decide .
i can hold you and your agents in contempt
and have my officers take you into custody ,
or you can comply with my ruling .
choose . right now .
you &apos;ve made a mistake , richard .
i agree , reven .
i should &apos;ve been a dermatologist .
i will see agent keen in chambers in five minutes .
we &apos;re adjourned .
thank you .
agent keen , you have the right to an attorney ,
but if you do request counsel
or refuse to answer my questions ,
this hearing is over , and i will determine
if your case should proceed in open court
based on the facts already in evidence .
are we clear to proceed ?
yes , your honor .
raise your right hand and repeat after me .
i , elizabeth keen ...
i understand we have a problem .
agent keen &apos;s testifying in camera
about the investigation as we speak -- judge &apos;s chambers .
eugene ames was a cop .
the judge will want his murder avenged .
best case , she &apos;ll be charged as an accessory .
and this task force will be shut down .
the major .
major ? what major ?
not a what , donald , a who --
the next name on the blacklist .
have you not been paying attention
to a word we &apos;ve been saying ?
agent keen will be charged --
the major runs a finishing school of sorts --
the most reputable of its kind .
he recruits wayward children ,
orphans , delinquents , outcasts ,
but only boys and girls of superior intelligence
who exhibit very specific sociopathic tendencies .
he then cultivates them into charming , well @-@ educated ,
cultured , attractive adults who are capable
of dangerous and horrible things .
all that matters is agent keen .
which is why we must find the major .
he and i had a rather significant falling out ,
and i can &apos;t locate him ,
which is why you need to put me in a room
with the malaysian deputy minister to the u.n.
you want the fbi to invite a u.n. diplomat
to meet with you ?
of course not .
inviting him for a chat
with one of your most wanted criminals would be ludicrous .
you &apos;ll need to abduct him .
okay , hold on . that &apos;s not gonna happen .
why on earth would --
because he has secrets i can exploit .
listen , i &apos;d snatch him myself , but time is short .
so , i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re going to have to do it for me .
you &apos;re asking us to commit a felony .
call it what you will , harold .
but if you want to prevent agent keen
from going to prison ,
you need to abduct deputy minister mamat krishnan .
minister krishnan !
minister krishnan !
can you please state your full name and occupation
for the record ?
elizabeth scott keen .
i &apos;m a special agent for the fbi .
and your assignment ?
my assignment is classified .
classified how ?
i &apos;m part of a black @-@ book task force
that investigates cases
brought forward by a criminal informant .
what informant ?
your honor , with all respect , i can &apos;t divulge the name --
agent keen , i &apos;m here to determine
whether the work you do should remain secret .
the burden is on you to convince me that it should .
if you choose to not even try ,
we will be having this conversation in open court ,
so i need to know-
raymond reddington .
your source is raymond reddington ?
yes .
i thought reddington recently escaped from a black site
and his whereabouts are unknown .
it was a cover .
he was never captured ?
he was captured . we helped him escape .
are you telling me a fugitive on the fbi &apos;s most @-@ wanted list
is actually an informant for the fbi ?
which is why what we do must remain a secret .
if criminals knew reddington was working with the fbi ,
then he would be of no value .
how old are you , agent keen ?
30 .
and how long have you been with the bureau ?
i ... i &apos;ve been a profiler for 18 months .
so , tell me , if the work of this task force
really does affect national security ,
why would the fbi pick someone
with as little experience as you to be on it ?
the fbi didn &apos;t pick me ,
and i didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with it .
you didn &apos;t want any part of it , the fbi didn &apos;t pick you .
so how did you ... come to be on it ?
reddington chose me .
why would he choose you ? why you ?
i thought we were here to talk about eugene ames .
what , he just knocked on your door one day ?
no . he sent a helicopter .
i had a very simple life ,
a husband i loved , a dog .
it was my first day on the job .
and suddenly , i was flying over restricted airspace .
they sat me down with deputy director harold cooper .
do you find it odd reddington surrendered himself
the day you started working as a profiler ?
i &apos;m sorry , what does this have to do
with what happened with mr. ames ?
well , as i understand it , the death of the harbormaster
came in connection with your work on this task force .
that is true ,
but you don &apos;t need all these details to determine --
tell me about the first meeting .
with ames ?
with reddington .
i &apos;d never been so terrified .
we &apos;d studied him at quantico
his crimes , his profile .
but when we sat down , he spoke as if he knew me .
agent keen , what a pleasure .
but you said you didn &apos;t know him ,
you &apos;d never met him .
did he , what , just expect you to believe him ?
no , of course not .
i had no idea what he expected .
i &apos;m a criminal . criminals are notorious liars .
everything about me is a lie .
you must have known how strange all of this was .
of course i did .
and yet you agreed to work with him .
well , he had intel .
he said a girl was going to be taken , a general &apos;s daughter .
we had to act .
and since he would only talk to me --
only you ?
he insists upon it .
a woman he &apos;d never met .
like i said , no one believed me .
and this intel about the girl --
was it accurate ? was she taken ?
yes .
these men are gonna come , and they &apos;re gonna take you .
are they gonna hurt me ?
they &apos;re not gonna hurt you , honey .
i &apos;m gonna find you .
with reddington &apos;s help , we were able to save her
and prevent an attack on d.c.
but the cost ...
... was ...
tom .
all i wanted was my life back ,
but reddington had other plans .
he told the deputy director
that he had a list of criminals he could help us find ,
and that was only the first .
the first what ?
name , on the list .
he told us , if we cut him a deal ,
that he could help us capture the kinds of criminals
the fbi can &apos;t find because we don &apos;t know they exist .
one day , you and i will be talking about this moment
in front of a senate hearing .
were you ordered to work with reddington ?
no .
and he couldn &apos;t force you .
so i &apos;m curious -- if he knew nothing about you ,
if his implications of some shared connection were false ,
why did you continue ?
because it turns out , they weren &apos;t .
they weren &apos;t false .
he knew things about me -- things i didn &apos;t even know --
about my husband at the time .
whatever connection he thought we had ,
whatever history he was implying we shared ,
i didn &apos;t care .
you &apos;ve discovered something curious
about your ... husband , haven &apos;t you , lizzy ?
he wanted me for a reason ...
and i wanted to know why .
that man has diplomatic immunity .
if anyone finds out -- - they won &apos;t .
how can you be so sure ?
you need to leave , donald .
you &apos;d better have a damned good reason for --
you need to leave .
let &apos;s have a little chat .
i don &apos;t know what you want ,
but you won &apos;t get away with this .
i &apos;ve always been leery of the united nations .
the very concept is comically dichotomous --
nations putting their self @-@ interests aside
in the hopes of building a global community ,
holding hands and kumbaya ?
i mean , honestly , it &apos;s like kindergarten .
do you have rug time ?
i did love rug time .
who are you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter who i am .
what matters is who you are --
a secret agent trained by the major ,
working away as a dedicated public servant ,
when , in fact , you &apos;re an asset
inserted into your country &apos;s diplomatic corps
by the sinaloa cartel to help them get a foothold in asia .
what do you want ?
the man who created you -- the major .
tell me his location ,
or i &apos;ll tip the cartel you &apos;ve been outed .
tell me , does hernandez remove the tongues
before the executions or after ?
please ...
i &apos;m not interested in your business .
i &apos;m not here to expose you .
i &apos;m only interested in the major .
where is he ?
let &apos;s talk about tom keen .
you said that reddington knew things about him .
what kind of things ?
tom keen ... the man i married , he was a fiction .
he didn &apos;t exist .
but detective wilcox says
that you and this fiction killed eugene ames .
that &apos;s impossible .
and why is that ?
because tom keen died
four months before mr. ames was killed .
wilcox is under the impression
that your husband is very much alive .
did you report his death ?
no .
why not ?
because i killed him .
you killed your husband ?
my ex @-@ husband . yes . i shot him in self defense .
&quot; he didn &apos;t exist . &quot; what does that mean ?
the man that i married ... he was perfect .
when i &apos;m with you , liz ,
i feel like i don &apos;t need to pretend .
i know that you accept me
for who i really am ,
and that is a gift
that i thank god for every day .
he kind , smart , a teacher .
or so i thought .
they say love is blind .
i certainly was .
blind to what ?
to the fact that our entire relationship was a lie ,
that my husband was a spy .
the only reason he was with me
was because of my connection to reddington .
the connection you say didn &apos;t exist .
i didn &apos;t know about it , but others did .
and you learned your husband was a spy from reddington ?
sort of . i had to find out for myself .
and when you did find out , what did you do then ?
i spied on him .
interrogated the people in his life ,
tried to find out who he worked for .
and did you find out ?
not before he realized ... that i knew .
how did that conversation go ?
it was heated .
is that when you murdered him ?
i didn &apos;t murder him .
his boss , berlin , he ordered tom to abduct me --
use me as leverage to get to reddington .
i had a gun to my head .
that &apos;s why i shot him .
that &apos;s convenient .
what is ?
using your job to justify shooting your lying husband .
did reddington want you to shoot him ?
what difference does it make ?
i &apos;m simply pointing out that shooting your husband
must have been a relief to both you and reddington .
no , you &apos;re calling me a murderer .
i &apos;m simply gathering the facts .
you &apos;re implying that my allegiance
is as much with reddington than with the task force .
agent keen , what exactly is your relationship , then ,
with raymond reddington ?
he &apos;s my c.i. ,
and if you want to air that out in open court ,
go right ahead , but do not question where my loyalties lie !
tell me about this task force -- how it works .
i told you . he has a list .
of criminals you don &apos;t know exist .
that sounds like an empty promise .
you &apos;d be surprised .
humor me .
there was a man named milton bobbit
who devised an ingenious way
to turn terminally ill patients into assassins ,
all while working as an unassuming insurance adjuster .
the courier moves high @-@ value commodities under his skin .
the alchemist makes people disappear by changing their dna .
none of this is possible .
that &apos;s what we thought .
how many of these cases has reddington given to you ?
♬ like a man on the run ♬
♬ i ain &apos;t got no place to hide ♬
♬ got one hand on my weapon ♬
♬ pray that god is on my side ♬
♬ your skin looks so cold ♬

♬ it &apos;s the heist ♬
♬ better watch your back , might take your life ♬
♬ it &apos;s the heist ♬
he keeps us busy .
i got nothing to say to you .
you know agent keen is in court today ?
she &apos;s telling the whole story .
well , her version of the story , anyway .
she says she never saw you on the boat
and that if the harbor master turned up dead ,
it &apos;s because you must have killed him .
you &apos;re lying .
no , she &apos;s lying .
we both know it .
but you &apos;re the one who &apos;s gonna pay the price .
look , this is the last chance i &apos;m gonna give you .
i told you my story already .
then you recanted .
you could get the death penalty , sam .
man , i already took a bullet for my troubles .
ain &apos;t no way that i &apos;m gonna get the death penalty , too .
nice try , but you don &apos;t have the evidence .
hold on , hold on , hold on .
who shot you ?
what ?
your story was , you caught a stray
walking through ellwood park .
but , now , that &apos;s not true , is it ?
not if you &quot; took a bullet for your troubles . &quot;
it was agent keen , wasn &apos;t it ?
yo , i never said that .
get a forensic unit to comb over every inch of that ship .
tell them to tear up the floor
until they hit water if they have to .
if there &apos;s a shell casing or a stray bullet ,
i want it found .

助理法官
you know , i &apos;ve never been in a situation like this .
i &apos;m being asked to prevent
a murder investigation from moving forward --
the murder of a cop , no less --
based on the grounds that what you do is so important
it needs to be kept secret
in the name of national security .
tell me why you think i should do that .
why will our democracy crumble if the world knows about
the inner workings of this task force ?
it won &apos;t , but people will die .
they already have .
the black site where we operate from --
there was an incursion .
a mole leaked the information about what we do ,
and as a result ,
an extraction team was sent to abduct reddington .
he barricaded himself in .
he wouldn &apos;t come out ,
and the team made good on their threat
to kill innocents until he did .
he just let people die ?
he didn &apos;t care who was killed ?
except one .
who ?
me .
he agreed to come out when they put a gun to my head .
after that , reddington vanished .
he wouldn &apos;t come back into the headquarters
until the mole was found .
and who was it ?
we don &apos;t know for sure , but reddington only returned
after the disappearance of diane fowler .
are you suggesting that the former head
of the criminal division at main justice was a mole ?
for whom ?
i don &apos;t know for sure .
he let agents die , but not you .
this man you &apos;re not in league with ,
who &apos;s not your friend .
you said before that reddington had answers
to questions you hadn &apos;t even thought of .
has he given you any ?
well ... there was a time
early on when i thought ,
because of his implications ,
that he might be my father .
you didn &apos;t know your father ?
no . he died in a fire .
and your mother ?
she died when i was young .
the man who raised me , my adoptive father ,
his name was sam milhoan .
does he have a connection to reddington ?
yes .
what connection ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
but they knew each other ?
yes , reddington was there when my father died .
you &apos;ve sat here and told me
you had no relationship with reddington
before he turned himself in , and now you &apos;re telling me
he was close enough to your father to be with him when he died ?
i didn &apos;t say they were close .
we &apos;re taking a break .
wait , why ?
you need to think long and hard
about this story that you &apos;re telling .
it &apos;s not a story . this is the truth .
that the man you said you &apos;d never met ,
a notorious criminal , had a mysterious relationship
with the man who raised you ?
yes .
your dead husband was a spy ,
and you never knew your parents ,
and no one &apos;s heard of the criminals you hunt ,
and for some reason , you claim not to know
why you were chosen to be at the center of it all .
wait ! wa-- i don &apos;t --
i don &apos;t want to take a break .
i would like to finish and go home .
you want something from the vending machine ?
this better be important .
you know the rules .
once you &apos;re in , no contact .
you said on the phone that this was mission @-@ critical .
what &apos;s wrong ?
hands .
reddington .
what is this ?
what do you want ?
i want tom keen .
you said reddington had a list .
he calls it the blacklist .
and who maintains it ?
does harold cooper keep track of -- - there is no physical list .
the names are all in reddington &apos;s head .
so they &apos;re all random .
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t believe so .
i believe that each case , each criminal
is somehow part of a larger agenda .
what agenda ?
i can &apos;t be sure ,
but h @-@ he always has an angle for every case .
i know that .
so reddington is using you to expand his criminal empire .
no . w @-@ well , yes .
and you &apos;re okay with all this ?
i wasn &apos;t at first , but as it turns out ,
the cases he brings us are far more valuable
to national security than what he gets in return .
but reddington still tailors individual cases
for his personal gain ?
they &apos;re not individual . some of them are connected .
connected how ?
reddington got a number from wu jing ,
a code that he entered into vicap
after helping us stop general ludd
in order to identify lucy brooks ,
also known as jolene parker ,
who he then tracked down using the alchemist &apos;s client list .
gina zanetakos , the courier --
i believe they all trace back to one entity .
at first , i thought the cases were all about getting berlin .
the man your husband worked for .
and most of them were .
and , yes , he &apos;s using us . it &apos;s true .
but in the process , we &apos;ve been able to capture
and kill a number of high @-@ value targets , including berlin .
and i thought that was the end game ,
but as it turns out , reddington has other agendas .
and all of those are connected somehow ?
i can &apos;t know for sure , but , yes , i imagine they &apos;re connected .
like his recent arrest in hong kong .
the cover story .
he wanted to be captured .
it &apos;s all a part of his quest
to find something he calls &quot; the fulcrum . &quot;
the fulcrum .
it &apos;s a blackmail file .
and before you decide whether or not
to discuss what we know in open court ,
you should know that , according to reddington ,
the fulcrum is proof of the existence
of a clandestine organization ,
and if its activities were made public ,
a number of very powerful people
would go to prison or be executed .
you say that like it &apos;s a bad thing .
we don &apos;t know if what rreddington alleges is true ,
and until we can confirm his allegations ,
until we find the proof ,
the only people who would benefit
from the fulcrum being publicized
are the criminals it identifies .
so , hong kong --
did reddington find this fulcrum ?
no .
and does he have some other ideas about how to locate it ?
yes -- through me .
you ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve come to believe
is the real reason he surrendered in the first place , asked for me .
and let me guess--
this comes as a complete surprise to you .
absolutely .
the same way you were completely surprised
when he asked for you .
yes .
and the way you found out that your husband was a spy .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right . you &apos;re absolutely right .
i should have known
that when my husband and i were planning family
that he was , in fact , a traitor
who had installed surveillance cameras in my bedroom !
of course i should have been aware
that the number four on the fbi &apos;s most wanted list
would turn himself in and speak only to me !
god , what a horrible profiler i must be
to have missed the fact that i am central
to the discovery of a blackmail file
that will tilt the balance of power in --
let me phrase this right -- the entire world !
i suck !
i think we &apos;ve gotten a little off topic .
regarding mr. ames ,
according to detective wilcox ,
you said that you were on official business
when you encountered mr. ames on the ship the phoenix .
as i told the detective , i was there looking for a fugitive .
fugitives -- from cumberland .
fbi . we &apos;re searching for two fugitives
escaped from cumberland last night .
i never said cumberland ,
and i was only looking for one man -- samuel aleko .
he had a warrant out for his arrest ,
and i had reason to believe
that he was hiding out on the phoenix .
in what way is mr. aleko connected
to the business of your task force ?
he had been an informant for a colleague of mine
who was killed in the line of duty -- meera malik .
i was hoping i could cut a deal with aleko
and have him inform for me .
mr. aleko says you &apos;re lying .
in his statement ...
which he recanted .
he says that you kept your ex @-@ husband hostage
on the phoenix for four months
and that you interrogated him there .
that &apos;s not true .
how often did you communicate with berlin ?
i want a name .
my name is jacob phelps .
did you murder jolene parker ? why you ?
have you spied on others ? is this ...
what do you know about reddington ?
what do you know about reddington ?
and when mr. ames found out what you were doing ,
you and your husband conspired to kill him .
no !
it &apos;s better this way .
let him do it .
get off me ! get your hands off me !
tom , stop !
as i told you , my ex @-@ husband is dead .
perhaps i should remind you that you &apos;re under oath .
perhaps i should remind you
that the only evidence against me is circumstantial .
so it &apos;s your word against his ?
if i were holding my ex @-@ husband hostage
and mr. ames found him ,
the last thing tom would do is kill him ,
the one man who could alert the authorities and set him free .
it makes no sense .
yes , it &apos;s my word against his .
not entirely .
okay . send him in .
i &apos;m going to check your story out with your boss .
good . i have no doubt that deputy director cooper
will confirm my accounts .
well , we should know soon enough .
mr. cooper is right outside .
for the moment , agent keen , i think we &apos;re finished .
director cooper , if you will .
look , i told you what happened with tom keen .
this is not my fault .
you vouched for him personally , bill .
i hired him on your recommendation .
the merchandise was defective .
no .
keen was perfect -- test scores , aptitude .
there was no indication he would become emotionally involved .
but he did .
he hasn &apos;t been in contact .
cut the crap , bill .
you acquired tom keen when he was a boy .
you trained him to be a deep @-@ cover operative .
it &apos;s all he &apos;s ever done .
it &apos;s all he knows .
when one operation ends ,
he comes back to you for another .
not this time .
mamat and i have come to something of an understanding .
he gets to remain alive and well , still deputy minister ,
and i get you .
i &apos;m equally hopeful you and i
can arrive at a mutually beneficial solution .
even if i knew where he was , i wouldn &apos;t tell you .
keen &apos;s betrayal cost me dearly
in time , money , lives .
some of the people closest to me are now dead
because of tom keen .
if i gave you his location , i &apos;d have to betray a client .
that shouldn &apos;t be hard , bill .
you betrayed me .
you sold me as an asset and then allowed him to turn
when berlin offered you twice as much .
you &apos;re in debt to me .
recognize this rather fortuitous opportunity
for you to begin to make things even .
where can i find tom keen ?
i have been listening to elizabeth keen
describe the work of your task force ,
and i have many questions ,
but it &apos;s safe to say there &apos;s only one i need to put to you ,
and that question is , as her boss ,
can you tell me if agent keen was on that boat ,
the phoenix ,
in her official capacity as an fbi agent ,
or was she there , as appears far more likely to me ,
for personal reasons that had nothing to do
with the work of your task force and the fbi ?
i understand you need to ask me the question ,
but i assume it &apos;s only to confirm
what agent keen has already told you --
that she has addressed this
and eliminated any need for me to testify under oath .
no .
agent keen put you directly on the hot seat .
she not only said that she was there on official business ,
she specifically said on the record
that you would confirm this .
now , i know this must be difficult for you .
agent keen is one of your own ,
and your instinct is to be loyal to her .
but she put herself in this position ,
and i strongly advise you to not commit perjury
to protect her from -- - yes .
yes , what ?
yes , agent keen was on that ship , the phoenix ,
as part of the official duties of our task force .
you &apos;re walking down a very dangerous road here , director .
you understand that if you perjure yourself --
you asked me a question , and i answered it .
are we finished ?
i can push you for specifics .
as i understand it , your job is to determine
whether a grand jury should go forward on this issue .
now , if you want to put me before them ,
have me answer their questions , fine .
but i have answered the one question
you said you wanted me to answer .
so if there &apos;s nothing else ...
director cooper .
something tells me we will be speaking again soon .
what do you got ? let me see it .
found it lodged in the ship &apos;s hull .
there it is .
have ballistics run it against agent keen &apos;s service weapon .
she surrendered it when she entered the courthouse .
got it .
have the lab process the blood
to look for a dna match to aleko .
i &apos;m gonna need results fast .
yes , sir .
well , that went as well as could be expected .
we got a lead on keen
and an invitation to sit in the minister &apos;s box
at next year &apos;s slasher cup .
cultural peculiarities notwithstanding ,
i find cockfighting to be abominable .
however , truth be told , i do love fried chicken .
you need to tell her , raymond .
tell her what ?
about tom .
you should have told her some time ago .
i don &apos;t know how do that , dembe .
yes , you do .
you tell her the truth by telling her everything .
i don &apos;t think i can do that .
maybe you should stop thinking about it and do it .
sorry to interrupt , your honor .
this couldn &apos;t wait .
what am i looking at ?
a discharged bullet found at the scene .
it &apos;s a match to agent keen &apos;s firearm .
trace amounts of samuel aleko &apos;s blood
were found on the casing .
when did you find this ?
five hours ago .
your honor , this is -- this is direct physical evidence
that agent keen lied to the court .
she says that she never saw mr. aleko on that ship ,
but that can &apos;t be reconciled
with the fact that a bullet fired from her gun
passed through mr. aleko &apos;s body
and was found on the ship with his blood on it .
it &apos;s proof that she &apos;s trying to cover up the truth , your honor ,
and the truth
is that elizabeth keen killed eugene ames .
