question -- when was the last time
a complete stranger took off her clothes in front of you ,
pointed to a big purple splotch on her back , and asked ,
&quot; what the hell is this thing ? &quot;
okay . how about it , mark ?
you know you &apos;ve always wanted one of ... these .
if you &apos;re a normal person , the answer is hopefully ...
never .
if you &apos;re a doctor ...
the answer is probably ... about five minutes ago .
nah . i &apos;m good .
i will take that waffle iron .
what ? i have never even seen you eat a waffle .
well , i would if i had a waffle iron .
okay , callie ,
we &apos;re not gonna take a waffle iron to malawi ,
and it &apos;s not gonna do anybody any good sitting in storage
for three years .
people expect doctors to have all of the answers .
congratulations . you won yourself a waffle iron . oh !
and a french press .
hey . stop giving ... my things away .
maybe i should pass on the french press .
the truth is , we love to think
that we have all of the answers , too .
so the art &amp; lesley phillips foundation
does have a few more hoops to jump through than the others ...
but their primary focus is alzheimer &apos;s research .
and if you get this grant ,
it is more than enough to get us started .
wow . you really did your homework .
i &apos;m a great student .
just the kind you want around when doing a clinical trial .
how &apos;s that going ?
it &apos;s fine .
is this because richard gave hunt
the $ 1 million and not me ?
is that why things are frosty between you two ?
we &apos;re not frosty . we &apos;re fine .
but if you &apos;re looking for solidarity ,
i would be more than happy to skip
owen hunt &apos;s trauma certification lab .
go . get certified .
basically ...
doctors are know @-@ it @-@ alls ...
until something comes along that reminds us we &apos;re not .
hey , i need someone to help me
set up the trauma lab and keep things running smoothly .
you &apos;d get your certification that way ,
and it &apos;s a pretty easy day .
it &apos;s a skills lab . it &apos;s already an easy day .
dr. hunt , i &apos;m going to need to borrow dr. yang .
oh . uh , what &apos;s up ?
lungs have become available for roy henley ,
and since he found himself on the transplant list
based on dr. yang &apos;s recommendation ,
i would say that that would make him her patient .
okay . uh , what do you need me to do ?
well , i just need someone to monitor him
while i go pick up the lungs .
so i &apos;ll be on my own ?
nope . dr. mcqueen , the cardio fellow ,
he will be around on the off chance that you need anything .
oh , and i finally was able to get roy &apos;s daughter
to agree to come in ,
so just , uh , keep an eye out for her , okay ?
okay .
you &apos;ll be fine . still an easy day .
i know .
am i early ? i tried really hard not to be .
that doesn &apos;t bode well .
we did the same thing with bailey when we were interns .
take turns treating a dummy , get an early lunch ,
then get back to work . it &apos;s lame .
charter plane was forced into an emergency landing
and collided with a greyhound bus .
mass @-@ casualty situation .
do i need to say it again ? let &apos;s move .
close to 30 victims in the field , some critical .
multiple blunt trauma injuries .
and i was so looking forward to an early lunch .
this is gonna suck .
welcome to trauma certification . you will work in teams of four .
each team will be responsible for nine casualties .
you may treat your patients using only what you can carry
with your two hands from this ambulance .
the evac helicopter is on its way .
you get your patients on the helicopter ,
you get certified . are you ready ?
get to work .
dr. grey .
uh , christy cornell , age 28 .
she &apos;s here for a gluteoplasty .
she &apos;s so tiny . there &apos;s hardly anything there to lift .
that &apos;s sort of the point , dr. grey .
i &apos;m ... oh , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry . that was--
oh .
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry .
christy &apos;s not here for a lift .
she &apos;s here for a gluteal implant .
yes . finally gonna get some junk up in this trunk .
this program shows a rendering of what you can expect
the gluteus to look like after the implant .
um ... could i see what it &apos;d look like
kicked up a -- just a couple of points ? - sure .
couple more ?
couple more ?
okay , stop . that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s my ass .
oh , come on . that was funny .
any joke that starts with an animal walking into a bar
is scientifically unfunny .
well ... humor me , dr. yang .
i need something to focus on .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m more nervous about getting new lungs
or about actually seeing my daughter .
don &apos;t think of it as getting new lungs .
think of it as getting rid of old , crappy lungs .
or don &apos;t think at all . okay , roy .
take some deep breaths . okay ?
corinne ?
roy .
how you been ?
this week or for the past 20 years ?
i &apos;m sorry . that was snarky .
no . no , snarky &apos;s good .
i like snarky . you get that from me .
roy ? roy ?
get the crash cart ! - he &apos;s -- he &apos;s not breathing .
v @-@ fib ! page cardio .
aren &apos;t you the doctor ? do something .
um ... - what @-@ what &apos;s -- what &apos;s happening ?
your father &apos;s developed cor pulmonale ,
and his heart is overloading .
what ? i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t understand .
i thought his lungs were the problem .
h @-@ his lungs are putting extra pressure on his heart .
dr. altman is picking up the new lungs right now .
i &apos;ll call her and apprise her of the situation .
what situation ? what is going on ?
his heart is failing .
and the damage seems pretty severe ,
so ...
uh , there &apos;s a possibility he &apos;ll need a new one .
a new what ? a new heart ?
you know what ? take over here .
i am going to call dr. altman ,
and , uh , uh , i &apos;m gonna get mcqueen .
dr. bailey , do you have a second ?
only if what you have to talk about is more important
than my being on time for an autopsy .
uh , that &apos;s arguable .
we &apos;re throwing torres and robbins
a bon voyage party in the doctors &apos; lounge this evening .
oh , that sounds lovely . uh , i have a full day .
but i &apos;ll try and stop by .
well , the thing is altman volunteered ,
uh , to pick up the cupcakes ,
but she had to pick up lungs instead .
and i just figured , since you are close to both these ladies --
you &apos;re asking me to take time out of my very busy day
to go to the bakery ?
or would you prefer that i ran on home
and baked some myself ?
no . of course not .
just an invitation .
mark .
i need to talk to you about christy cornell &apos;s ... butt .
okay .
but first i need to talk to you about cupcakes .
callie . check out all the great stuff the kids in peds made me .
they want me to take pictures
of their crafts in africa .
oh , wow . that &apos;s awesome .
you &apos;d be surprised how often you find yourself in need
of a macaroni face glued to a paper plate .
no . i mean , it &apos;s way better than gauze ,
malaria pills , antibiotics .
well , you are a delight this morning .
is there something that you &apos;d like to talk about ?
um ... no .
no , i &apos;m just ... no .
torres , robbins .
i thought you &apos;d be halfway to malawi by now .
yeah , we had some last @-@ minute paperwork .
plus , i @-@ i promised the kids i &apos;d come and say good @-@ bye .
that &apos;s good . the work you two will be doing there
will reflect very , very highly on this hospital .
sure , uh ...
it was a surprise to learn that i &apos;d have to replace two ,
uh , excellent attendings as opposed to just the one .
but then that &apos;s a chief &apos;s problem .
no one wants to really hear a chief &apos;s problems .
it &apos;s a shame , though , torres .
i had , uh ...
i had such big plans for you .
big plans .
irrigate and suction .
thanks . clamp , please .
dr. mcqueen , i really need you to take a look at roy henley .
they tell me he &apos;s developed cor pulmonale
and circulatory collapse .
yes , sir . that &apos;s correct .
did you put him on dopamine ,
milrinone , and nitric oxide ?
yes , i did .
he &apos;s stable . critical , but stable . i--
what would you do for a patient
with reduced cardiac output ,
hypotension , sinus tach , and metabolic acidosis ?
i &apos;d insert an intra @-@ aortic balloon pump .
exactly .
i &apos;ll be there when i can , dr. yang .
but it really doesn &apos;t sound like you need me at all .
irrigate and suction , please .
you must be dr. bailey .
i &apos;m dr. stanley , head of pathology .
this must be ...
mary portman , 30,
multiple organ failure , cause unknown .
she came in for a standard colostomy reversal
and never woke up .
well , all right .
looks like we &apos;ve got something we can sink our teeth into .
um , i have a list of possible causes
i &apos;d like to check as we proceed .
we have a specific order to the way we work down here ,
so we &apos;ll see what we see when we see it , okay ?
okay .
according to this card , this guy &apos;s got a blown right pupil ,
an atlantooccipital dislocation , open @-@ book pelvis ,
a large open abdominal wound --
jeez ! -- a sucking chest wound with seven broken ribs .
this guy is all messed up .
or he &apos;s dead .
ah . right . yes .
moving on .
cristina ?
hey . how long have you been here ?
oh , not long . i just needed some fresh air .
and how &apos;s the patient ?
uh , he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s great . a couple of complications ,
but yeah , i &apos;m handling it .
are you sure that you &apos;re okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s , uh ... chilly out here .
it &apos;s him . um ... i need to --
i ... have to go look .
okay . all right .
cristina .
you can do this .
okay . thanks .
grey .
congratulations . you &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re certified .
now can you go inside and , uh , give cristina a hand ?
well , what does she need ? did she ask for me ?
meredith ... please . okay ?
yeah .
thanks .
what are you doing here ?
owen sent me .
i don &apos;t need a babysitter .
i &apos;m just an extra set of hands . what &apos;s the situation ?
he went into cardiogenic shock ,
so i &apos;m inserting an intra @-@ aortic balloon pump
and hoping there are no other complications before teddy gets back .
so we are watching for hemolysis , a gas embolism ,
a blue leg from peripheral ischemia --
okay , you know , if you want to do something , uh , his ,
uh , daughter is up in ccu ,
and she needs an update .
okay .
blue team , status report .
we arrived on the scene to find nine casualties .
we identified three as priority one ,
requiring immediate evacuation . four were priority two ,
allowing for delayed evac .
one was priority three ,
and the last was sadly ... dead on the scene .
nice work , kepner .
but it seems to me that
you now have two dead patients .
excuse me ?
well , while you were standing around
waiting for the helicopter to arrive
and not keeping a constant eye on your patient &apos;s injury ,
this one developed a femoral bleed ,
bled out and is now sadly dead .
no , a @-@ a femoral bleed -- that wasn &apos;t on the card .
really ? well , it &apos;s on this one .
o @-@ oh , no , no , no . wait . that &apos;s not fair .
patients don &apos;t suddenly die .
it just seems that way when you stop paying attention .
food for thought . red team , go .
i &apos;m so sorry , you guys .
those guys right there are priority three .
we tagged these over here as priority two .
awesome .
tell me about the bandaging on these two .
priority ones ...
right . the reservation &apos;s under stanley . jennifer stanley .
4 people for 8 : 00 .
well , that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
why would 8 people want to have dinner at 4 : 00 ?
dr. stanley , the-- the clots
could indicate a pulmonary embolus .
let me talk to your manager .
dr. stanley .
what &apos;s up ?
i was asking about those blood clots .
now couldn &apos;t a pulmonary embolus have led to her death ?
those are postmortem clots , dr. bailey .
perfectly normal .
hello . hi .
yes , there &apos;s been a mistake with my dinner reservation .
&quot; big plans . &quot; &quot; big plans . &quot;
you know what ? i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;ve got big plans myself-- great big african plans .
yeah , you do .
yeah . i don &apos;t need to grow cartilage in a lab .
i &apos;ll be building bones from dirt .
i &apos;ll be figuring out how to create unbreakable joints
out of blood diamonds .
i &apos;ll be-- i &apos;ll be making artificial limbs out of elephant ivory .
i &apos;m pretty sure a couple of those would be frowned upon
by the world community .
oh , whatever .
science isn &apos;t about making friends .
the helicopter has to be getting here soon .
it &apos;s been three hours . just-- just a few more minutes .
here . take these .
right ? right , dr. hunt ?
the helicopter will be here any minute ?
nice rain gear , karev .
shouldn &apos;t you be more concerned with your patient staying dry ?
yeah , well , he &apos;s a dummy , and i &apos;m a person , so ...
you know , a dry patient is less likely to die
of hypothermia or shock .
something to think about .
alex , you can &apos;t break the rules like that .
that &apos;s unsanctioned use of a trash bag .
you &apos;re gonna mess up our certification .
oh , you need to relax . this whole uptight thing ?
this is why you have no friends .
hey .
okay , this is why you have one friend .
give me that back !
are you crazy ?
there you go , little guy .
no hypothermia for you .
everyone .
green team &apos;s patients are all dead .
only red team and blue team remain .
whoa . you see a helicopter ?
take a knee , learn something .
take a knee ?
he &apos;s gonna scalp them .
we &apos;re in &lt; i &gt; apocalypse now &lt; / i &gt; , and we &apos;re gonna get scalped .
that , right there . see what she &apos;s doing ?
okay , i @-@ i swear . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m not an idiot .
i just-- if-- if dr. altman
doesn &apos;t get this new heart ,
is that , like , game over on the lung transplant ?
uh , there are a variety of factors .
right now , i &apos;m not sure , but i can get an answer for you .
fine . uh , where are we on the heart ?
again , not sure .
dr. altman should be calling with an update very soon .
okay . uh , when can i see him ?
i have to check with dr. yang .
you &apos;re just like a--
you &apos;re just like a wealth of information , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m new to your father &apos;s case ,
and dr. yang is
i called him roy .
i decided to do that on the drive over
&apos;cause i hadn &apos;t seen him in 20 years ,
and i want to blame him for that .
i do blame him for that .
except ...
he tried .
he tried to be ... my dad in the beginning .
and ... i couldn &apos;t forgive him for leaving my mom .
and then he stopped trying .
and ...
i have twins . they &apos;re 3 .
and i don &apos;t even know if he knows that .
i never told him .
and then ... and then i walked in there ...
and i called him roy .
i called my dad roy .
and i just ...
i need for that to not be the last thing he hears from me .
please .
the daughter really needs to talk to you .
she has too many questions that i can &apos;t answer .
why don &apos;t you try reading his chart ?
cristina , if you want to be pissed at me , that &apos;s fine .
but don &apos;t--
okay , you know what ?
we &apos;re not gonna do this right now ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m kinda busy here .
crap .
all right . look , get him on ecmo .
that should keep him alive until i can get back with these lungs .
there is a shot that once we get them in ,
the heart damage will reverse without the excess pressure .
teddy says we need to get him on ecmo .
what &apos;s it look like i &apos;m doing ?
okay , apparently , uh , cristina &apos;s on it .
grey ...
how &apos;s she doing ?
uh , she is doing great . she &apos;s doing great .
good , good .
intestines show a well @-@ healed anastomosis
with no evidence of infection ,
inflammation , or necrosis .
i think this is as good a place as any to call lunch .
what do you say ?
lunch ? well , we have to check
the adrenal glands and the kidneys .
what if the thyroid shows pathology ?
don &apos;t worry .
those kidneys aren &apos;t going anywhere on their own .
yes , i &apos;m aware ,
but microscopic pathological changes
are harder to interpret once the organs start decomposing .
we &apos;ll only be gone 45 minutes . they &apos;ll keep .
still , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s right--
okay , dr. bailey , i &apos;ll see you in 45 minutes .
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re chocolaty looking with sprinkles .
where &apos;d you get &apos; em ?
at that grocery store down the street .
this isn &apos;t a baby shower for some nurse
who couldn &apos;t keep her knees together , grey .
torres and robbins deserve better than off @-@ brand crap .
i &apos;m not an errand girl . okay ? i &apos;m a doctor with a patient
who &apos;s about to make a giant butt @-@ shaped mistake .
that &apos;s not for you to say .
okay , well , someone has to .
the only reason a woman does something like this to her body
is to impress a guy .
okay , sure , it starts with a giant butt ,
and then the next thing you know , she &apos;s giving up her friends ,
she &apos;s moving in with him before she &apos;s even ready ,
and if she &apos;s not careful , she &apos;ll find herself a 26 @-@ year @-@ old stepmother
to the pregnant daughter she didn &apos;t even know he had .
and then she &apos;s single , dyeing her hair a new color .
and you know what ? it &apos;s really hard to manage your roots
when you &apos;ve been committed to the psych ward .
psych ward ?
it happens .
great . you &apos;re in here .
now where can i sulk ?
oh , there &apos;s plenty of room . that &apos;s all i &apos;m doing .
please sit down .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i have been down in the morgue all morning
trying to determine the cause of death for mary portman ,
who survived the horrors of gary clark
only to die from a surgery that i perform every day .
so it &apos;s very important to me ,
and it &apos;s very important to mary &apos;s husband ,
to find some answers today .
but do you know what is important to the pathologist
who is leading the autopsy ?
oh , her dinner reservations and her lunch break--
basically food--
that &apos;s what &apos;s important to this pathologist .
feeling better ?
no . not really , no .
what &apos;s all this ?
oh , i &apos;m just trying to write this grant proposal .
why only trying ?
because the more you research alzheimer &apos;s ,
the more depressing it gets .
and then when you include the early onset ,
the type that ellis grey suffered from ,
it just gets worse .
there &apos;s a woman in england . she &apos;s 32 .
she can &apos;t recognize her 3 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
it &apos;s just ... terrifying .
this pathologist also chews gum while she works .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s disgusting .
thank you .
christy .
yes .
dr. grey is concerned that , uh , you might be
going through with this surgery for the wrong reasons ,
that you might be trying to please someone
who prefers a more ...
robust body type .
mm . dr. grey .
i hope you don &apos;t take this the wrong way .
but even through your lab coat ,
i can tell , you have an amazing ass .
and with an ass like that , i bet you know what it &apos;s like
to find the perfect pair of jeans .
jeans that make you feel like
you &apos;re the sexiest person ever to put on a pair of pants .
and i envy that , &apos; cause i never have .
every pair hangs off me ...
unless i shop in the boys &apos; department .
and i have tried gaining weight , dr. grey .
it turns out , i &apos;m a person
whose fat goes straight to my upper arms and my boobs ,
which makes it really hard for me to wear a sundress ,
which is all i can wear ,
because jeans don &apos;t fit .
so , dr. grey , i am getting a big , juicy ,
easy @-@ to @-@ grab @-@ on @-@ to ass ,
and you better believe , i am doing it just for me .
and i &apos;m telling you ... i can &apos;t wait .
you are so nice .
okay , red team &apos;s patients have all died .
only blue team remains .
keep an eye on karev . that &apos;s what resourceful looks like .
good effort , avery .
but this incision you made is too wide .
you lacerated the superior thyroid arteries .
well , i just--
move on .
damn it !
i hear it . i hear the helicopter .
you what ?
i- i @-@ i @-@ i hear it ! i hear it !
oh , wake up !
you don &apos;t hear the helicopter
because , a , it &apos;s imaginary ,
and b , the imaginary helicopter is never coming !
hunt &apos;s trying to break us , trying to teach us
some b.s. lesson about how trauma isn &apos;t fair or whatever .
we &apos;re not done until he says these dummies are dead .
the end !
that &apos;s not true ! no !
you are wrong !
screw this . i &apos;m done .
what ?
jackson !
avery , where are you going ?
you-- ugh !
avery . avery , get back here .
no !
no ?
no , sir .
that should do it .
close her up and call it a day .
aren &apos;t we gonna get a sample from the brain ?
sure ,
in about two weeks , when it &apos;s had a chance to firm up in the formalin .
oh , it &apos;s possible to cut the brain fresh .
it &apos;s also possible that the moment
you cut into a fresh brain , it slides apart like jell @-@ o.
if you don &apos;t want risk that ,
you put it in formalin and wait two weeks .
i- i &apos;m not trying to tell you how to do your job , but you--
no , that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re trying to do ,
and i &apos;m trying very hard not to hold it against you .
this is what i do , all day , every day .
i mean , do you think i failed medical school ?
is that your actual belief , that people become pathologists
because they fail to become surgeons ?
the autopsy was inconclusive , dr. bailey .
and believe me , i hate that at least as much as you do .
he &apos;s stable ?
he &apos;s critical .
i have to keep , uh , checking his acid @-@ base balance ,
but , yes , he &apos;s stable @-@ ish for now .
great . so let me take over here ,
and you can go give his daughter an update .
no , you go .
um , tell her that his , uh , blood pressure is coming up--
she needs to hear from you .
well , he needs to be monitored .
well , i can do that .
okay . she doesn &apos;t need to hear an update from me .
all she wants is to make sure that i know that she &apos;s afraid ,
and i can &apos;t hear that right now ...
because i am scared enough as it is .
i was scared when he coded .
i &apos;m scared now that he &apos;s stable .
i &apos;m scared walking across the lobby .
i am scared all the time .
well , let me help you .
you cannot help ! okay ? you can &apos;t help me .
dr. altman &apos;s 30 minutes out .
we need to get him to the o.r.
dr. grey can help with that .
cristina ...
bon voyage !
oh , my god . it &apos;s a going away party .
you guys .
um ... this is a party ?
it &apos;s ... a busy day .
no . yeah , i mean , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;ve just been at this hospital since residency . but , uh ...
if people are too busy to see me off ,
then they &apos;re too-- they &apos;re too busy .
callie ...
well , it &apos;s hard to blame &apos; em , torres .
i mean , we &apos;re down a couple of attendings .
things are going to be busier all around for a while .
well , i &apos;m glad you could find the time , chief ...
with all your chief problems and big plans ...
which were what exactly ?
now why would i just give away my good ideas ?
oh , he &apos;s just crabby . he &apos;s messing with your head .
yeah , well , i &apos;ll never know , will i ?
thank you , both , so much .
um , i @-@ i actually have to finish up some packing .
so i &apos;m gonna-- i &apos;m gonna go .
good luck .
give &apos; em hell .
i- i don &apos;t want to go home yet .
you want to see us give a lady a really big ass ?
oh , my god , yes .
sir !
you said the helicopter was gonna be here hours ago ,
and it &apos;s not here , and i &apos;m not complaining ,
but where is it ?
well , the rain &apos;s still pretty bad .
probably got caught in a hail storm .
no !
no ! i know what that card is gonna say .
it &apos;s gonna say he has cardiac tamponade
with associated hypotension and bradycardia ,
but he can &apos;t ,
&apos;cause i already did a pericardiocentesis
and bolused him with i.v. fluids .
she &apos;s right .
what do i do ? do i--
karev !
grab his feet .
the patient !
son of a bitch .
that &apos;s awesome !
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
this ambulance is not in play .
oh , you &apos;re just making stuff up ,
which i can do , too ! and i say it is in play .
can &apos;t fit nine patients on an ambulance .
but two will fit just fine .
seven of my patients may have died today ,
but these two won &apos;t ! &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna get them
on this ambulance ,
and i &apos;m gonna take &apos; em to that hospital right there !
all right !
kepner ,
this ambulance was involved in the accident
and no longer runs .
there are keys in the ignition , so let &apos;s see .
looks like i got triple @-@ a. ha !
apparently they could get here
when the helicopter couldn &apos;t .
now move !
or i will run you down !
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
john doe , multiple chest and extremity traumas .
still hypotensive despite two large @-@ bore i.v.s started in the field .
all right , kepner . that &apos;s enough .
we need a full workup and
likely a thoracotomy .
i suspect active bleeding in the chest .
will you tell us we won ,
or she &apos;s never gonna stop .
it &apos;s not a contest .
karev !
call the o.r. and make sure that there &apos;s a room available .
will do .
all right , all right , fine .
blue team wins .
blue team wins ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , you win .
he &apos;s gonna live for 40 more years
and have 15 grandkids . you happy ?
blue team wins !
yes .
here . check that out .
&quot; alzheimer &apos;s is a bad disease .
we should cure it . &quot;
12 hours worth of work .
dr. stanley refuses to cut into mary &apos;s brain
without letting it set in fixative for two weeks .
look , i need you to go over her head .
i can &apos;t do that . she &apos;s right .
i can &apos;t speed up the process any more than she can .
that is not what you were supposed to say .
look , miranda , i know this has been ...
a very personal loss for you ,
but you need to let it go .
i have to go and tell mary &apos;s husband
that i don &apos;t know why his wife died ,
that i can &apos;t answer the one question he has to ask .
and i can &apos;t answer that question
because medicine-- because science is failing me .
that i take personally ,
that i can &apos;t accept .
and don &apos;t you dare stand there
and talk to me about letting things go .
i &apos;m not the one who can &apos;t stop thinking about
the possibility of his wife getting alzheimer &apos;s
long enough to write a damn essay .
shouldn &apos;t you be with the patient ?
he &apos;s prepped and in the o.r.
and now you &apos;re gonna talk to me .
please just go back downstairs .
cristina .
how are you fine ?
how are you just completely fine ?
i &apos;m ruined , okay ?
i am dead . i am wrecked .
and you &apos;re just walking around , what , babysitting me ?
as if you didn &apos;t go through the same thing , too ?
why are you okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know what ? you-- you were there , too , you know ?
you were there , too , with your sad eyes ,
screaming at me to save his life ...
i wasn &apos;t ...
you know , then telling the guy to shoot you
and not giving a crap about yourself or your pregnancy .
cristina--
i didn &apos;t have a choice ! and you did that !
if it was anyone else on the table ,
if it was anyone else standing there ,
i would &apos;ve walked away !
you would not have--
i could &apos;ve walked away , and then i wouldn &apos;t--
you wouldn &apos;t have walked--
be here !
walk with me , dr. yang . tell me everything .
now who am i gonna talk to about women ?
you have derek .
he &apos;s married and self @-@ satisfied .
it &apos;s irritating .
well , you can always e @-@ mail .
what ?
it &apos;s not my place . i don &apos;t ...
say it .
i give a lot of boob jobs .
okay . not where i thought you were going .
but i also reverse a lot of boob jobs .
women come to me a year ,
two years after they &apos;ve had work done ...
and they &apos;re totally unhappy with the decision they &apos;ve made .
today , though ,
you watched me give a lady a really big ass ,
and-- and i &apos;m not the slightest bit worried about it ,
because i know for a fact ,
there &apos;s no boyfriend pressuring her .
it wasn &apos;t about anyone else . it was for her .
as your friend , i gotta tell you ,
you sound an awful lot like someone
who &apos;s getting double d &apos;s
just &apos; cause her girlfriend likes a big rack .
by &quot; big rack , &quot; i mean africa .
i love her , mark .
i know you do .
but you need to figure out ...
how to love africa , too .
avery . hey .
hey . you don &apos;t get to just walk away when i &apos;m teaching .
two of my friends died during the shooting ,
so ... thanks .
i don &apos;t need lessons on how unfair trauma is .
i lost dozens of friends in the field ... dozens .
and i have never-- never--
used them as an excuse to quit .
you &apos;re a doctor , avery .
that doesn &apos;t stop just &apos; cause you &apos;re up against a wall .
you need to figure out how to be a doctor
no matter what you &apos;re dealing with
and no matter what tools you don &apos;t have .
that is the lesson you need to learn .
you don &apos;t get to quit .
so if i need to drag you outside by the throat ,
you are coming with me and you are going to finish !
if his heart doesn &apos;t start beating soon ,
we &apos;re not gonna be able to take him off bypass .
he &apos;s back up to his core temperature .
i don &apos;t see any leaks . all the connections are right .
we &apos;re just gonna have to wait and see
if dr. yang &apos;s hard work has paid off .
there it is .
nice work , dr. yang .
well done .
clamp .
and , you know , sure , there &apos;s not a lot to do over there ,
but , uh , that just means less to distract us from the medicine .
it &apos;ll just be us focusing on the medicine , which is great .
what ? oh , my god . did you forget your passport ?
i won the carter madison grant .
i won the carter madison grant .
do you know how rare that is ?
do you know how special that is ?
this is the biggest opportunity of my professional career .
i- i get to go to malawi with almost unlimited funds
and help children-- help tiny humans--
who might otherwise never see a pediatric surgeon .
i get to change lives .
that &apos;s the dream . i am living the dream .
and i am over the moon about it .
or i @-@ i would be , but you are ruining it for me ,
first with your whining ,
and now with your fake , smiley , passive @-@ aggressive enthusiasm .
you are ruining africa for me .
i - i &apos;m not .
you are !
okay .
fine . i don &apos;t want to go to africa . okay ?
but i do want to be with you .
okay ? so i &apos;m really trying here .
we &apos;re gonna miss our plane . let &apos;s go .
oh , god . okay . you want to fight ?
the flight &apos;s 18 hours . we can fight on the plane .
you &apos;re ruining this for me .
and i don &apos;t want to do this .
what-- what &apos;d-- so what does that mean ?
what , you suddenly don &apos;t want to go or ...
i don &apos;t want to go to africa with you .
arizona ... no .
okay ? no .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ? you &apos;re sorry ?
it &apos;s three years .
i &apos;m gonna miss my plane .
you take care of yourself .
no .
no !
please . please . i can ...
we can-- we can do this .
we can-- we can figure this out .
you stay here ...
and be happy .
and i &apos;ll go there ...
and be happy .
if you get on that plane ,
if you go without me , we are done .
do you hear me ? we are over !
we are standing in the middle of an airport
screaming at each other .
we &apos;re already over .
yang .
dr. altman told me about your work today .
i know it &apos;s been hell for you these past few months ,
so ...
well done .
thank you , sir .
chief .
do you have a minute ?
i can &apos;t wait until the next skills lab .
i am totally on your team .
&quot; move or i &apos;ll run you down ! &quot;
freakin &apos; hilarious .
we &apos;re all looking for answers ...
in medicine ...
in life ...
in everything .
were you just checking out my ass ?
not the first time .
won &apos;t be the last .
no !
sometimes the answers we &apos;re looking for
have been hiding just below the surface .
i had the worst day today .
been working , um ...
working on the grant proposal ,
and i just-- i couldn &apos;t do it .
and then i realized ...
it was you .
it &apos;s a clinical trial for alzheimer &apos;s .
it &apos;s serious work , and i couldn &apos;t think of anything but you .
i know you want to be a part of the trial ,
but i can &apos;t have you anywhere near it .
cristina blames me .
she hates me .
other times ,
we find answers when we didn &apos;t even realize
we were asking the question .
avery , good .
sometimes ...
the answers can catch us completely by surprise .
did you hear ? the lab--
it could not have gone better , and you should &apos;ve seen kepner .
i mean , you wouldn &apos;t think it to look at her ,
but there is a trauma surgeon in that girl .
i wish you could &apos;ve been there .
how was your day ?
i quit .
what ?
you were right .
i can do it . i can still be a surgeon .
i just ...
don &apos;t want to anymore .
and sometimes ,
even when we find the answer we &apos;ve been looking for ...
avery , that &apos;s enough .
