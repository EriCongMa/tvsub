&quot; can we start again , please ? &quot;
they say life doesn &apos;t give you second chances .
but we do .
surgeons do .
hey . e.r. ?
yep .
so , sorry about last night .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you &apos;re mad .
we just -- we really lost track of time --
i &apos;m not . it &apos;s fine . forget it .
oh .
you break a bone , we put it back together .
you bleed , we make it stop .
you flatline , we resuscitate you .
what did you decide ?
i didn &apos;t ! i was up all night .
then you had ample time .
you can &apos;t drop a bomb like &quot; i have a brain tumor &quot;
and expect me to decide anything .
i need to know more .
you don &apos;t need to know anything that you don &apos;t already know .
okay , great . why the pills ?
i &apos;m getting a migraine .
you &apos;re not helping .
this -- this is what i mean .
is it a migraine or is it the tumor ?
what kind of tumor is it ? what does it mean ?
a @-@ are you -- are you gonna get tremors during surgery ?
you &apos;re talking me through a procedure
and you slur your speech ?
i need to know more !
you don &apos;t get to .
of course i &apos;m not gonna do anything to endanger my patients .
i am handling my situation responsibly ,
but it is my situation , and you are not entitled to it .
you are entitled to my knowledge --
to my years of discoveries and mistakes and dead ends
and blood and sweat and innovations
that you don &apos;t have to go through .
that &apos;s the deal .
the chance to take my work into your future .
just you .
so ...
could you please make up your mind ?
but as much as we give people second chances ,
surgeons don &apos;t usually get them .
surgeries are canceled .
round on my service . i have an appointment .
and don &apos;t ask what it is ,
&apos;cause , of course , i &apos;m not gonna tell you .
because the kind of mistakes we make
are sometimes impossible to recover from .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i was -- i was up all night .
me too .
sofia &apos;s been acting out ,
asking questions about me and arizona ,
and i don &apos;t know what to tell her or how to tell her ,
so i &apos;m just not sleeping .
i &apos;m miserable . why didn &apos;t you sleep ?
oh , you don &apos;t want to know .
what &apos;s going on ?
derek and i were up having sex all night .
yeah , i kind of didn &apos;t want to hear that .
69 @-@ year @-@ old male ,
jumped two stories from a burning building .
shocky , b.p. &apos; s 95 over 60 with a rate in the 120s .
g.c.s. 14 in the field .
hattie ...
why am i looking at two patients on one gurney ?
she &apos;s dead.- what ?
hattie ...
we couldn &apos;t find a pulse .
and we tried to pull her off ,
but the husband just held on .
he was agitated . he wouldn &apos;t let her go .
so we had to stop
&apos;cause we were afraid we were gonna hurt him .
what &apos;ve we got -- oh , wow .
hattie ... witnesses said he carried his wife
out the window and jumped to escape the fire .
we think he was trying to break her fall .
let &apos;s get them into trauma one .
amy , where do you need me ?
you got the head lac in bed 3 , right ?
yeah , that &apos;s nothing . i can jump in on this .
i don &apos;t need you .
is that good management ,
you leaving your star player on the bench ?
you won &apos;t be for long .
people are always hitting their heads on something .
his skin is mottled and cyanotic .
we have to get her off of him .
sir , you have to let her go .
no .
we have to move her to help you .
no , no .
sir , what is your name ?
norris .
i @-@ is she ... ?
norris ...
you don &apos;t have to worry about that right now , sir .
no , he does , actually . of course he does .
norris , what is your wife &apos;s name ?
is she ... ?
harriet .
hattie .
norris .
norris , it &apos;s time to let hattie go . she &apos;s gone .
gone ? what do you mean gone ?
norris , she died .
no . no .
she &apos;s gone . i &apos;m sorry .
hattie , no ...
you did everything you could .
no ! no ...
you helped her through the hardest part .
you held her , you protected her ,
and she died in your arms .
and i &apos;m sure she couldn &apos;t think of a better way to go .
she &apos;s no longer in any pain , norris , but you are ,
and she wouldn &apos;t want you to be .
you have to let her go now so we can help you , okay ?
she &apos;s mine . i can &apos;t .
norris . norris , i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s time .
okay .
on 3 --
1 ... 2 ... 3 .
let &apos;s go . come on .
i &apos;ll go pronounce .
hattie ...
hattie ...
honey ... honey ...
airway &apos;s intact , but there &apos;s a little soot .
hypotensive and a rigid abdomen .
pupils are equal and reactive bilaterally .
right lower leg is tense and swollen .
i &apos;m gonna measure compartment pressures .
quiet .
breath sound is decreased on the left .
add right tib / fib to the trauma films .
quiet !
i got a pulse .
barely palpable , but it &apos;s there .
trauma two !
pierce , shepherd , you &apos;re with me .
she &apos;s alive ?
she is .
you &apos;ll take care of her ?
i will .
i &apos;ll take real good care of her . i promise .
where &apos;s dr. herman ?
did you call my mom ?
you said to wait until there &apos;s something to be worried about .
well , now i &apos;m worried .
why isn &apos;t she moving ?
emily , corey , i &apos;m concerned
that the baby might be bleeding into the tumor itself ,
and it &apos;s causing her to be anemic .
oh , my god . will she be all right ?
where &apos;s dr. herman ?
she had an , um -- an appointment with another patient .
well , she can do something , right ?
she said she &apos;d do everything to get the baby to term .
that was the whole point of planning fetal surgery .
and that &apos;s still -- that &apos;s still the point .
dr. herman will likely perform an intrauterine transfusion .
i will apprise her , and we &apos;ll come back
and talk to you about how to move forward .
sit tight , okay ?
okay .
where is dr. herman ?
no idea , but she better pick up ,
because emily jensen &apos;s baby &apos;s gonna die .
good tube placement .
yeah , the hemopneumothorax is bigger .
edwards , prep for a chest tube .
before you do that , edwards , can you check with c.t. again
and see when they can take us ?
but she &apos;s bleeding into her lung .
i know , but i felt a depressed temporal bone fracture ,
and she has spinal fluid coming out of her ear .
i need a c.t. to confirm .
i &apos;m on my way up to radiology .
is anyone free to update the family ?
sarah ?
what are you doing here ?
amelia .
you &apos;re ... a doctor ?
i am , yeah .
my parents , they were in a fire .
oh , god .
okay . um ...
this is what we know so far .
your father has some internal injuries
and a leg fracture .
your mom has some bleeding into her lung
and a cranial fracture .
as her neurosurgeon , i &apos;m gonna need to do surgery to --
wait .
you ... want to do surgery on my mom ?
no . no .
i &apos;m sorry , but no . no . i @-@ i --
excuse me . i need a different doctor .
sarah ...
she -- she cannot touch my mother .
it &apos;s not just --
i need a different doctor right now .
okay . calm down . let &apos;s just --
no ! i want another doctor !
what &apos;s the problem here ?
she cannot touch my mother . she &apos;s a drug addict .
i can &apos;t have her operate on my parents .
hold it . dr. shepherd is our --
is a junkie .
i met her in narcotics anonymous .
she &apos;s hooked on oxy .
she overdosed with her boyfriend
and woke up with him dead in bed with her .
i want another doctor.now !
come with me . just come with me , please .
no ! i &apos;m -- no , no ! - this way , please .
you keep her away from them !
hunt , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ve got this .
keep her away from them !
follow me , ma &apos;am . calm down and follow me .
what was that ?
you just took amelia &apos;s surgery ?
what was i supposed to do ?
take her side .
she was being attacked .
the woman had it out for her , meredith .
if anything goes wrong , she &apos;ll go blaming her
because she was an addict .
you &apos;re gonna go talk to owen , right , and clear this up ?
yes , i will .
i paged you three times .
yeah , keep your pants on .
i &apos;m consulting on three babies here --
i have a mom whose fetus is bleeding into her s.c.t.
she needs an intrauterine transfusion .
it &apos;s inserting a 6 @-@ inch needle into an umbilical vein
without rupturing membranes or inducing bradycardia .
i &apos;ve never done one , and herman &apos;s awol .
so , you deliver . you &apos;ll take the baby out .
i &apos;ll repair the s.c.t. myself .
alex , the baby &apos;s 28 weeks .
the whole point in seeing herman
was to try and get her to term .
yeah , it &apos;d be great if she were here ,
but i don &apos;t know how to save this kid .
you &apos;ve reached the voicemail of dr. nicole herman .
herman , robbins again .
the jensen baby &apos;s anemic , and the mca flow is 70 .
i will give you 30 minutes , and if i don &apos;t hear from you ,
i &apos;m gonna do a c @-@ section and resect the s.c.t.
okay .
i &apos;m gonna book an o.r. ,
and can you be ready in 30 minutes if i need you ?
yeah .
that &apos;s good . okay . thank you .
she &apos;s losing it .
yes , she is .
look , it &apos;s your first solo surgery .
it &apos;s a big deal .
i mean , if you &apos;re too nervous ,
i am more than happy to take it off your hands .
i &apos;m not nervous .
great . then you &apos;d better not be pregnant .
because if you let karev throw a baby in there ,
i will never forgive you .
i &apos;m not pregnant , and i am not nervous .
i know how to fix a hernia .
step one -- medial dissection .
step two -- identify triangle of doom ,
avoid the iliac vein .
step three -- puke .
bailey &apos;s gonna eat you alive .
no , she &apos;s not , because i &apos;m a badass .
step three -- lateral dissection .
step four ...
identify triangle of pain .
see ? great .
i have got this procedure down ,
and i am not afraid of little bitty dr. bailey .
think you could turn the faucet on for me , dr. badass ?
i &apos;d do it myself , only i &apos;m so little bitty .
shh ! here she comes .
that &apos;s really scary , the idea of her operating on someone .
did you know she was an addict ?
it must be because she &apos;s shepherd &apos;s sister .
i need to talk to you .
she just said it in front of everyone --
all this stuff that i said at meetings about --
it &apos;s okay . are you sober ?
how is it okay ? everyone is looking at me .
are you sober ?
of course i am .
did you disclose your recovery when you were hired ?
i didn &apos;t have to ! derek hired me .
he knew . i assumed people knew .
and you &apos;ve done nothing wrong .
okay ? she did .
she violated your privacy .
and you are under no obligation to tell anyone anything more ,
unless you &apos;ve done something
to compromise your ability to do your job , and you haven &apos;t .
so you don &apos;t need to say anything more about it .
okay .
those are your rights .
it &apos;s the past , and you don &apos;t have to defend it .
i thought i got away from it .
coming here , i thought ...
i thought i had a chance to ...
but you never get away from it .
no .
no , you don &apos;t .
what do i do now ?
you just stay on track .
you look after yourself , do your job .
and as soon as you can , you need to get to a meeting .
well ?
time &apos;s up . let &apos;s take the baby out .
you &apos;re making the right call .
hey , it &apos;s robbins , again .
so you &apos;ve left me no choice ,
and for all i know , you could be dead .
so i &apos;ve made my decision about you .
i am telling chief hunt as soon as i get out of surgery .
is that her ?
yeah , that &apos;s her .
dr. shepherd , um ...
could we go somewhere private and talk ?
i &apos;m busy right now , actually .
this is important .
listen ...
is there anything you want to tell me ?
to ... clear this up ?
i don &apos;t .
i think you heard all the facts .
what i heard was a very distraught woman shouting .
and i think there is another side to this story .
a woman requested another doctor ,
and i was removed from the case .
that is her right . people have rights .
listen , i am just trying to have a conversation .
that is none of your business if i &apos;m doing my job .
am i doing my job ?
amelia , i am trying to help you here .
i just ...
i don &apos;t have to discuss this with you .
and that &apos;s your answer ?
that &apos;s my right .
okay .
let &apos;s clamp and cut .
and here she is .
i &apos;ve got her .
all right , let &apos;s exteriorize the uterus .
starting an umbilical line .
how &apos;s she doing ?
let &apos;s pre @-@ oxygenate her before we intubate .
can you handle this ?
you just need to deliver the placenta
and then close the ...
i &apos;ve only done about a million c @-@ sections .
how you doing now ?
bad .
o.r. 7 is waiting for us .
graham , i &apos;m going with the baby ,
so just come and find me when you &apos;re done , all right ?
all right , let &apos;s go ! we &apos;re on the move !
damn it . this lobe is trashed .
we &apos;re gonna have to do a lobectomy .
we really have to take that much lung ?
we &apos;ll try to save as much as possible .
wait . where &apos;s the bleed ?
where &apos;s the bleed ? - i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t find it .
okay .
everything okay there ?
all right . here &apos;s what you do . drop the suction .
yeah .
now reach in there and grab the hilum
and twist it off like a garden hose .
just slow the flow of blood until i can find ...
ah ! yes . there we go .
hattie ...
that was , uh ... that was really cool .
you may keep going , dr. shepherd , but go easy .
hattie here has a hot date with her husband .
okay . gotcha .
sinus flap coming off .
yep , just like it &apos;s supposed to .
good .
boy or a girl ?
what &apos;s that ?
your baby .
oh . right . yes .
um , actually we have decided to be surprised .
that &apos;s a good call .
ah , it &apos;s april &apos;s idea . actually , it &apos;s driving me crazy .
i mean , what would be the point
of knowing everything you possibly could about your child
when it &apos;s so much fun to be hopelessly unprepared , right ?
yeah , we found out my son was a boy .
see ?
yeah , but i didn &apos;t know he was gonna be delivered
by an intern in a pitch @-@ black room
in the middle of a superstorm , but surprises happen .
that &apos;s a good story , but i find no comfort in it .
yeah , well , and this .
i &apos;ve been on the bench for weeks , yet here i am ,
saving a woman &apos;s life without even opening her skull .
embrace surprises , avery .
lateral incision &apos;s done . going for medial now .
his spleen is shattered . give me the longest kelly you have .
here you go .
he was a human trampoline for his wife .
pretty amazing .
better than burning to death .
i can &apos;t imagine .
i can imagine throwing my wife out a window .
ex @-@ wife .
everyone keeps saying that things will get easier ,
and i &apos;m sure everyone can &apos;t be wrong , but , man , i am ...
i &apos;m really ready for the easier part .
i think derek and i may have hit the easier part .
yeah . you mentioned .
i don &apos;t know . we keep calling these time @-@ outs , you know ?
and then we &apos;re so busy time @-@ outing
that we forget we &apos;re even mad .
i don &apos;t know . he seems better ... at home , at least .
i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop ,
but maybe there is no other shoe .
there &apos;s a shoe .
you know what your time @-@ outs are ?
band @-@ aids .
they cover the mess ,
they stop the bleeding for a little while ,
but you &apos;re just ignoring the damage , and then ...
good times .
trust me . there &apos;s gonna be another shoe .
awfully quiet over there .
just focused , dr. bailey .
do you think you should be updating me on your progress ?
yeah . i , uh , just finished the medial dissection
and identified the triangle of doom ,
then lateral dissection , triangle of pain .
all that &apos;s left is the mesh .
sounds like you have everything under control .
totally . totally under control .
and you didn &apos;t barf in your mask .
bravo .
okay , you have to resect really carefully ,
especially this premature .
oh , no . there &apos;s another bleeder .
you &apos;re gonna have to devascularize this whole thing .
yep , yep . i got it .
this is nice . it &apos;s like old times .
you haven &apos;t let me get used to the new times .
dr. robbins , dr. maddox has asked for you in o.r.6.
ugh . graham ... it &apos;s a simple c @-@ section .
i can take this if you got to go . he says it &apos;s urgent .
put the blood in a rapid infuser !
graham ?
the placenta was adhered ,
and as i started to pull , everything started bleeding !
how many units has she gone through ?
i don &apos;t know .
graham !
two , three ? !
eight .
i did what i was supposed to ! i pulled at the placenta !
gown and glove me right now ! damn it , graham .
it looks like placenta percreta .
it &apos;s probably invading deeper structures .
can &apos;t you see that ? i mean , ugh !
why didn &apos;t anybody stop him ? !
all right , listen ...
call hunt or any trauma surgeon that &apos;s on call .
on it .
graham , move .
move !
your mother had a spinal @-@ fluid leak .
i was able to stop it without opening up her skull .
she &apos;s still in surgery ,
and we hope to repair the damage to her right lung .
your father has some internal bleeding .
we &apos;ll know more soon .
thank you both so much .
i didn &apos;t want to do that to her ...
that other doctor .
i &apos;m in recovery , too .
i broke an oath .
i wanted -- i want to be supportive , but ...
but it &apos;s my mother .
we &apos;ll let you know when we know more , okay ?
derek , what am i looking at here ?
what are you talking about ? amy ?
what that lady said , how much of it is true ?
is it all true ? she &apos;s a drug addict ?
she killed her boyfriend ?
she &apos;s my sister .
i &apos;m asking because i need to know
if we want her out front as neuro chief .
i &apos;m asking you if you think
she &apos;s the best person to be heading the department .
okay .
i get it . she &apos;s your sister .
say no more .
thanks .
i &apos;m here !
placenta percreta invading the bowel and bladder , right ?
i paged hunt . where &apos;s hunt ?
he &apos;s busy .
well , i didn &apos;t want you to see this .
oh , please . where do you need me ?
get in here and start clamping .
the ultrasound didn &apos;t detect this ?
no , even herman didn &apos;t see it .
and pregnant women have a higher blood volume ,
distended vessels , they bleed out faster --
oh , can it , graham . oh , no .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
what is it ?
oh , it extended to her kidney .
and the ureter -- - lap pad !
keep that blood coming !
she &apos;s losing a liter every two minutes !
good lord . how do any of us even have babies ?
see , that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t want you in here .
i see no other injuries .
the bowel is intact .
i think we can close .
how much longer do you guys have ?
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve called for an emergency board meeting .
is this about amelia ?
it is .
didn &apos;t derek talk to you ?
he did .
owen . owen !
callie .
other shoe .
we got this . go .
close for me .
did owen talk to you ?
i didn &apos;t tell him anything . i don &apos;t have any--
did he talk to you about your job ?
he &apos;s saying he &apos;s gonna take my job ?
you &apos;ll talk to him , right ?
i did . i did already .
i think i might have given him the idea .
oh , no . derek -- derek --
i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t mean to
d @-@ derek , no ...
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i will fix it .
he wants to give you my job ,
and you &apos;re gonna let him .
no , i &apos;m not .
you son of a bitch . you son of a bitch !
you kept me here !
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t . amy , don &apos;t .
you asked me to come .
you asked me to stay ,
when i was building a life --
a new life -- a second chance that i had given myself
just so that you could feel better about leaving .
i was trying to help you , and i was trying to help myself .
i was just try--
and you gave me this job ,
and you have abused me since the second i took it .
but that is not enough .
you need to destroy my entire caree--
how can you do this to me ?
i will fi--
to me ? !
i will fix it !
how can you do this ? !
i will talk to them !
i will talk to all of them , and i will fix it .
you &apos;re my brother .
i &apos;m looking for derek shepherd . have you seen him ?
oh , there you are .
what is going on ? what is this meeting about ?
there &apos;s not gonna be a meeting . i &apos;m gonna talk to hunt .
he said he already talked to you .
he did .
well , did you set him straight about amelia ?
i didn &apos;t .
what ?
not right now , mer . i can &apos;t talk to you about this .
not right now .
derek , what did you say ?
what did you do ?
i just finished my first solo tapp surgery .
all right . did you throw up in your mask ?
no . why does everyone keep asking me that ?
i nailed it .
medial , lateral ,
pain , mesh -- boom !
what about the triangle of doom , the iliac vein ?
what about it ?
well , you skipped it .
no , i didn &apos;t .
jo , you didn &apos;t say it .
but i did it .
in there . i @-@ i didn &apos;t skip it in there .
in there , i ...
i did it , right ?
are you asking me ?
medium clip .
got it .
3 @-@ 0 silk . hang another unit .
she &apos;s gone through 100 units of blood products .
dr. robbins , dr. karev is asking to see you .
oh , her baby .
did he say what &apos;s wrong ?
just that he needed you .
damn .
go .
no , i can &apos;t leave this woman .
i got her .
make sure her baby &apos;s okay .
sorry !
w @-@ what happened ? where &apos;s dr. karev ? !
what is it ? what happened ?
oh , i finished . it went well .
you were all in a twist about this kid ,
so i thought you &apos;d want to
update the dad with me .
oh , god . alex , no , his wife is --
is the baby okay ?
yes . uh , the surgery went well .
her vitals are good .
she &apos;ll likely need to
stay in the nicu for a while ,
but she &apos;s looking good .
has emily seen her ?
she &apos;s still in surgery .
um , there were some complications during her c @-@ section .
wait , she &apos;s still in surgery ?
we &apos;re doing everything that we can .
i @-@ i have to go back .
everything you can ?
how serious is this ?
she lost a lot of blood .
where &apos;s dr. herman ?
dr. herman had a plan .
now you &apos;ve got my baby in critical care ,
and my wife is bleeding to death !
i don &apos;t even know who you are .
i have to go back .
where the hell is our doctor ? !
it was just a misunderstanding with owen .
he &apos;ll take care of it . he said he would .
he did this , meredith .
why should i believe that ?
why do you believe it ?
because he &apos;s your brother .
that &apos;s why he can do it .
it &apos;s why he could steal my toys
and pull my hair and call me names .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m family .
it &apos;s why he thinks he can get away with this .
you don &apos;t get it .
no . i don &apos;t .
i was raised as an only child .
and i &apos;m historically lousy at being a sister .
you &apos;re here right now .
that &apos;s good enough .
you don &apos;t remember ?
no , i ... of course i remember .
i @-@ i just wanted to double @-@ check with you ,
you know , to be safe .
my lateral dissection , it looked good , right ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i went anywhere near the iliac vein .
you don &apos;t think ...
wilson , either you hit the woman &apos;s iliac vein or you didn &apos;t .
which one is it ?
so , what do we do now ?
we run a c.t ....
no . i run a c.t.
you ?
you just stand here and pray
that your patient isn &apos;t bleeding to death right now .
so robbins is tied up . should we wait ?
no , yeah , we should get started .
no , no , no .
well , derek , we just need to figure out ...
i know you &apos;re trying to figure out what &apos;s going on .
i know you &apos;ve heard some stories about amelia .
i let you believe something . i let you believe that , uh --
shepherd , you were pretty clear when we spoke , so --
she &apos;s in recovery .
she works really hard at it .
she &apos;s been successful in recovery , and ...
this hospital should have protected her .
this woman should have protected her .
and ...
more importantly , i should have protected her .
i didn &apos;t .
and i didn &apos;t because i wanted her job .
i wanted my old job back .
so now we &apos;re here .
my fault .
derek , why did you even ... ?
she should stay where she is , owen .
she can do the job .
she is doing the job .
i couldn &apos;t do it any better .
how &apos;s his baby ? is there any change ?
no . she &apos;s good . she &apos;s stable . let me do it .
no , i have to tell him .
how ? how , alex ?
how do i tell him that his wife is dead ?
where the hell is herman ? she should have been here .
that &apos;s not helping ! i was here .
emily was my responsibility , and i lost her .
so let me do it .
placenta percreta is very difficult to diagnose ,
and in cases as severe as emily &apos;s , it &apos;s usually ...
insurmountable .
if your baby had come to term ,
it &apos;s likely emily would have died .
no .
corey , this is what you have to understand .
if i &apos;d done the surgery we &apos;d planned ,
it &apos;s likely that , down the line ,
we would have lost emily and your daughter .
dr. robbins did everything within her power for your wife .
but she saved your baby &apos;s life .
your baby is alive because of her .
i &apos;m not sure what that was about ,
but it doesn &apos;t change anything .
okay ? i can &apos;t do it . i won &apos;t do it .
you ... you abandoned me .
you ... you left me no choice but to take that baby .
you made me ...
go ahead . finish your thing .
well , i --
i , um ...
oh , no , no . go on . get it out .
thank you .
what ?
what &apos;s happening ?
yesterday , my doctors decided
i need some aggressive radiation therapy immediately ,
so that &apos;s where i was today . it just ...
hit me a little harder than i expected .
everything i said to that man was true .
you saved a baby that we would have lost .
i watched you .
i logged in to the hospital interface .
i monitored your progress all day .
you made the right call .
you made all the right calls .
that &apos;s not . if ... if you had been here , you would &apos;ve ...
mnh @-@ mnh . no .
the only thing i could &apos;ve done
is perform an intrauterine transfusion ,
try to keep the baby in a little longer ,
get her closer to term .
and maybe ... maybe ...
we could have detected the percreta earlier .
but it doesn &apos;t mean we could &apos;ve done anything for her
that you didn &apos;t do .
i want to know how to do it , the intrauterine transfusion .
&apos;cause if there &apos;s a chance that i could &apos;ve saved that mom ,
then i need to know how .
for the next time .
i can show you tomorrow .
unless you &apos;re planning to have a conversation with chief hunt .
okay.i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
go home .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
hey , i &apos;m gonna be here with you , okay ?
edwards , out .
yes , ma &apos;am .
how was the c.t. ?
she never made it to c.t.
wait ...
this was your surgery , wilson .
i &apos;m gonna need you to talk to the family .
oh , my god .
she &apos;s dead ?
she &apos;s dead ? oh , my god .
i never said that .
i @-@ i remember doing everything correctly .
wilson .
i even ... i even ...
she &apos;s fine !
what ?
i didn &apos;t say she was dead .
i said she never made it to c.t.
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re screwing with me .
i didn &apos;t take her to c.t.
because i saw you do it in the o.r. , dr. badass .
oh , my god.oh , my god ! you have a problem !
no , you do .
you second @-@ guess yourself .
this was the first in a career full of surgeries
you will be doing alone .
before too long ,
there won &apos;t be anyone to catch you when you fall .
your patients need to trust
that when you take them into surgery ,
you know what you &apos;re doing .
now , how can you expect them to do that
if you don &apos;t even trust yourself ?
you are so mean .
i am , indeed .
tell all your little bitty friends .
i heard about your patient . you okay ?
there was so much blood , jackson .
i mean , i know we see it all the time , but ...
yeah .
i just -- i didn &apos;t think it was gonna stop .
and i know it can be scary .
but you and our baby are just fine .
so do not worry , okay ?
i &apos;m not worried .
are you worried ?
all the time .
how can you not be ?
you know how .
right .
it &apos;s all in god &apos;s hands .
god , i don &apos;t know how you can do that --
just write off all the unanswered questions .
we don &apos;t get to know the answers .
that &apos;s your answer .
i don &apos;t know why that woman had to die tonight .
she exsanguinated . that &apos;s why .
yeah , okay . but why ?
because all of it just ...
all of it just happened .
you &apos;re really comfortable with that answer ?
see , i don &apos;t know how you do that .
is that you ?
how &apos;s hattie ?
thoracotomy .
i had to resect her entire right lower lobe .
she &apos;s gonna need rib stabilization .
norris , too . ex @-@ lap , avulsed spleen .
torres did a fasciotomy on his right leg .
i think it &apos;s gonna be okay , though .
we &apos;ll see if her lungs don &apos;t shut down overnight .
we gave them the best chance we could .
yeah . we &apos;ll see .
we &apos;ll see .
again , about last night --
would you let it go ? i &apos;m not mad .
well , you sound like someone who &apos;s mad .
of course i &apos;m mad .
you invited me to dinner ,
and then didn &apos;t come to the dinner -- at your own house !
i know . i told derek it was a bad idea .
you didn &apos;t want to talk to richard .
i wanted to have dinner -- with people and conversation .
i don &apos;t know anyone here .
i have no friends .
i do nothing at night .
i go to the grocery store ,
and i buy sad single @-@ serving packets of food
for sad people who eat alone .
i was really excited for pot roast .
and people !
i changed my outfit four times .
and , no , i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to talk to webber ,
but that wasn &apos;t gonna stop me from coming ,
because i &apos;m really sick of talking back to my tv ,
and i &apos;m scared i &apos;m gonna get a cat .
and i was really excited
that someone had invited me to dinner .
so , yeah , i &apos;m pretty mad .
hattie &apos;s awake .
what ?
what happened ?
mom , there was a fire in your apartment .
you &apos;ve had surgery , but you &apos;re doing well .
your husband saved your life .
he picked you up and jumped out a window with you .
well , that was stupid .
oh , norris , you saved my life .
i nearly killed you .
but that doctor , she promised .
where is she , that woman doctor ?
oh , dr. shepherd .
she promised they &apos;d save you , and she was right .
are you busy tonight ?
oh , well , i was going to catch up on some reading ,
some medical journals , but ...
oh , actually , no .
no , i am , um -- i &apos;m not busy.why ?
this was ellis &apos; house .
this is where you grew up .
it was nicer before alex trashed it .
oh , shut up . it smelled like books .
well , it smelled a lot better when i lived here .
now it just smells like karev .
wait . you lived here , too ?
everybody lived here .
i practically lived here with george , right ?
george was my ex @-@ husband .
he was in their resident class .
o &apos;malley .
o &apos;malley .
i &apos;m sorry . your husband ?
yeah , she does dudes , too .
true . i did him once .
true .
she did .
i didn &apos;t do him .
i did do george , though -- once .
oh @-@ ho @-@ ho ! yeah , yeah.oh , god . yeah , yeah .
we &apos;re all related through sex .
we all have sexual relations.that is horribly weird .
it &apos;s hard to give second chances .
i probably should &apos;ve called first , but ...
someone told me to go home ,
and i wasn &apos;t really sure where i should go .
see ? everyone lives here .
beer &apos;s in the fridge . hard stuff &apos;s on the counter .
thank you .
it &apos;s even harder to ask for them .
a chance to do it again ,
knowing what you know now ...
what you &apos;ve learned ...
... a chance to do it completely differently ...
you okay ?
i was at a meeting .
i &apos;m moving out .
tomorrow .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just so sorry .
don &apos;t , derek . don &apos;t even bother .
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt you .
i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t even think about me .
you saw an opening , and you took it .
i have always wanted to protect you ever since dad died .
i didn &apos;t want to .
i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t want me to .
but i promised .
then you came up here , and i realized ...
i didn &apos;t have to worry anymore .
you were okay . you were fine .
you were more than fine . you could ...
take care of yourself now , and ...
... i didn &apos;t need to anymore .
i needed you today .
... a chance to right our wrongs ,
to try and correct our mistakes ...
i don &apos;t know who i am anymore .
not anybody i ever thought i &apos;d --
i &apos;d be .
i try and make the right choices for meredith ...
the kids , you .
and , um ...
i &apos;m angry all the time .
i &apos;m miserable , and i don &apos;t know what to do with it .
all i do is hurt people .
the last people i want to hurt , and i just ...
i just can &apos;t get control of it .
i don &apos;t know what to do anymore .
i know how you feel .
we call it rock bottom .
... a chance to try and start over from scratch .
