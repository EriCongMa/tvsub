all right , i &apos;m moving my infantry division ...
... augmented by a battalion of orcs from lord of the rings .
we flank the tennessee volunteers
and the north once again wins the battle of gettysburg .
not so fast .
remember , the south still has two infantry divisions .
plus superman and godzilla .
no , no , no . orcs are magic . superman is vulnerable to magic .
not to mention
you already lost godzilla to the illinois cavalry and hulk .
why don &apos;t you just have robert e. lee charge the line
with shiva and ganesh ?
you guys ready to order ?
hang on , honey .
shiva and ganesh ,
the hindu gods , against the entire union army ?
and orcs .
i &apos;ll be back .
excuse me .
ganesh is the remover of obstacles and shiva is the destroyer .
when the smoke clears
abraham lincoln will be speaking hindi and drinking mint juleps .
all right , my boss says you have to either order or leave and never come back .
what do you recommend for someone who worked up a man @-@ sized appetite
from a morning of weight training and cardio funk ?
a shower .
i &apos;ll take the heart smart platter .
all right , thank you , and sheldon ?
we don &apos;t eat here .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s good .
well , it &apos;s all good .
statistically unlikely .
just get a hamburger .
you like hamburgers .
i like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers .
you can &apos;t make the assumption that i &apos;ll like the hamburgers here .
i &apos;m sorry .
give him a hamburger .
all right , which one ?
the classic burger , the ranch house burger ,
the barbecue burger , or the kobe burger ?
can &apos;t we just go to big boy ?
they only have one burger ... the big boy .
well , the barbecue burger is like the big boy .
excuse me , in a world that already includes a big boy
why would i settle for something like a big boy ?
because you &apos;re not at big boy !
fine , i &apos;ll have the barbecue burger .
make it two .
waitresses don &apos;t yell at you at big boy .
hey , leonard .
hi , guys .
hey . hi , leslie .
i didn &apos;t know you ate here . we don &apos;t .
this is a disturbing aberration .
leslie , this is penny .
she lives across the hall from sheldon and me .
and walks in quiet beauty like the night .
howard , i &apos;ve asked you not to do that .
leslie and i do research together at the university .
oh , wow , a girl scientist .
yep , come for the breasts , stay for the brains .
so , i &apos;m glad i ran into you .
the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist .
what happened to elliot wong ?
he switched over to high @-@ energy radiation research
had a little mishap , and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him .
so are you in ?
yeah , sure , why not ?
great , we rehearse on tuesdays at your place .
why at my place ?
yeah , department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone .
nice meeting you .
yeah , you , too .
leonard , i didn &apos;t know you played the cello .
yeah , my parents felt that naming me leonard
and putting me in advanced placement classes
wasn &apos;t getting me beaten up enough .
if you &apos;re into music , i happen to be a human beatbox .
really ?
i &apos;m actually not that into music .
so , hey , your friend &apos;s really cute . anything going on with you two ?
l - leslie ?
no , no . what , are you kidding ?
he asked her out once . it was an embarrassing failure .
thank you , sheldon .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
was that supposed to be a secret ?
aw , that &apos;s too bad .
you guys &apos;d make a cute couple .
oh , dear .
what &apos;s the matter ?
she didn &apos;t take my order .
how can she take your order
when you &apos;re too neurotic to talk to her ?
nevertheless , this will be reflected in her tip .
what did penny mean , &quot; you &apos;d make a cute couple ? &quot;
well , i assume she meant the two of you together would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute .
an alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one .
as in , &quot; oh , look , leonard and leslie made mr.and mrs.goldfarb.
aren &apos;t they adorable ? &quot;
if penny didn &apos;t know that leslie had turned me down ,
then it would unambiguously mean
that she , penny , thought i should ask her , leslie , out
indicating that she , penny , had no interest in me asking her , penny , out .
but , because she did know that i had asked leslie out
and that she , leslie , had turned me down ,
then she , penny , could be offering consolation .
&quot; that &apos;s too bad , you would have made a cute couple ... &quot;
but while thinking : &quot; good , leonard remains available . &quot;
you &apos;re a lucky man , leonard .
how so ?
you &apos;re talking to one of the three men
in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought .
well , what do you think ?
i said i could follow it . i didn &apos;t say i care .
our whole universe was in a hot , dense state
then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ... wait !
the earth began to cool
the autotrophs began to drool , neanderthals developed tools
we built the wall we built the pyramids
math , science , history , unraveling the mystery
that all started with a big bang
bang !
i admire your fingering .
thank you .
maybe sometime you can try that on my instrument .
good night , guys . good job . thanks .
see you next week .
that was fun , leslie . thanks for including me .
you &apos;re welcome .
if you &apos;re up for it
we could practice that middle section again .
sure , why not ?
just so we &apos;re clear , you understand that me hanging back to practice with you
is a pretext for letting you know that i &apos;m sexually available .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;m good to go .
i thought you weren &apos;t interested in me .
that was before i saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs .
you mean my cello ?
no , i mean the obvious , crude , double entendre .
i &apos;m seducing you .
no kidding .
what can i say ? i &apos;m a passionate and impulsive woman .
so how about it ?
gee . uh ...
is it the waitress ?
penny ?
what about her ?
i thought i saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her .
which , unless you &apos;re a heroin addict , points to sexual attraction .
well , i did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast .
which could cause a positive urine test for opiates
but certainly not dilate my pupils .
so i guess there was no point in bringing it up .
you and the waitress then .
no ... no .
there &apos;s nothing going on between penny and me .
so you &apos;re open to a sexual relationship ?
yeah , yeah , i guess i am .
good .
yeah , it is . it is good .
did you want to start now ?
why don &apos;t we finish the section first ?
oh , okay .
a little musical foreplay . terrific .
i &apos;m g @-@ good to go . me , too .
oh , hey , sheldon . what &apos;s going on ?
i need your opinion on a matter of semiotics .
i &apos;m sorry ?
semiotics . the study of signs and symbols .
it &apos;s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics .
okay , sweetie , i know you think you &apos;re explaing yourself
but you &apos;re really not .
just come with me .
well ?
well , what ?
what does it mean ?
oh , come on , you went to college .
yes , but i was 11 .
all right , look ,
a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn &apos;t want to be disturbed
because , they &apos;re ... you know , gettin &apos; busy .
so you &apos;re saying leonard has a girl in there ?
well , either that or he &apos;s lost his tie rack
and gotten really into bryan adams .
oh , leonard , you magnificent beast .
we really shouldn &apos;t be standing here .
this is very awkward .
oh , come on , leonard &apos;s had girls over before , right ?
oh , yes , but there &apos;s usually planning , courtship , advance notice ...
last time , i was able to book a cruise to the arctic to see a solar eclipse .
you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex ?
i didn &apos;t have to . the dates just happened to coincide .
so , do you know who &apos;s in there ?
well , there &apos;s leonard .
and he &apos;s either with leslie winkle or a 1930s gangster .
hmm , good for him .
good for leonard .
okay , g &apos;night .
no , no , wait , hold on .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i don &apos;t know what the protocol is here .
do i stay ? do i leave ?
do i wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage ?
gee , sheldon , you &apos;re asking the wrong girl .
i &apos;m usually on the other side of the tie .
hi , leonard ?
it &apos;s me , sheldon ...
in the living room .
i just ... i wanted you to know i saw the tie .
message received .
you &apos;re welcome .
carry on .
give my best to leslie .
big boy ...
someone touched my board .
oh , god , my board !
leonard ! leonard !
hey , what &apos;s the matter ?
my equations , someone &apos;s tampered with my equations .
are you sure ? of course i &apos;m sure .
look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics .
the sign &apos;s been changed .
oh , yeah .
but doesn &apos;t that fix the problem you &apos;ve been having ?
are you insane ? are you out of your mind ?
are you ... hey , look .
that fixes the problem i &apos;ve been having .
you &apos;re welcome .
youdid this ?
yeah , i noticed it when i got up to get a glass of water .
so i fixed it and now you can show that quarks
are asymptotically free at high energies .
pretty cool , huh ?
&quot; cool &quot; ?
listen , i &apos;ve got to get to the lab .
thanks for a great night .
thank you . i &apos;ll see you at work .
hold on . hold on !
what ?
who told you you could touch my board ?
no one .
yeah , i don &apos;t come into your house and touch your board .
there are no incorrect equations on my board .
oh , that is so ...
so ...
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve got to run .
if you come up with an adjective , text me .
inconsiderate .
that is the adjective , &quot; inconsiderate . &quot;
you can stare at your board all day , sheldon .
she &apos;s still going to be right .
i &apos;m not staring , i &apos;m mulling .
oh , hey , leonard . oh , hi .
so ...
... how &apos;s it going ?
pretty good .
just pretty good ?
i &apos;d think you were doing very good .
pretty , very ... there &apos;s really no objective scale for delineating variations of &quot; good . &quot;
why do you ask ?
well , a little bird told me that you and leslie hooked up last night .
sheldon !
so , is it serious ? do you like her ?
i don &apos;t ...
th @-@ th @-@ that &apos;s really two different questions .
uh , i &apos;m not ...
sheldon , we have to go !
boy , you &apos;re wound awfully tight for a man who &apos;s just had sexual intercourse .
all right , well , i &apos;ll talk to you later , but i am so happy for you , leonard .
thank you .
what did she mean she &apos;s happy for me ?
is she happy that i &apos;m seeing someone ?
or is she happy because she thinks that i &apos;m happy ?
because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy .
even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy .
because the second person , though happy ,
is now romantically unavailable to the first person .
do you realize i may have to share a nobel prize with your booty call ?
you know what ?
i &apos;m being ridiculous .
who cares what penny thinks ?
leslie is a terrific girl .
she &apos;s attractive .
we like each other .
she &apos;s extremely intelligent ...
she &apos;s not that intelligent .
she fixed your equation .
she got lucky . you don &apos;t believe in luck .
i don &apos;t have to believe in it for her to be lucky .
regardless , i have a chance at a real relationship with leslie .
i &apos;m not going to pass that up for some
hypothetical future of happiness with a woman
who may or may not want me to be happy ,
with a woman who is currently making me happy .
leonard ... yeah ?
i still don &apos;t care .
hey , leslie . careful , leonard .
liquid nitrogen , 320 degrees below zero .
why are smashing a flash @-@ frozen bana ?
because i got a bowl of cheerios and i couldn &apos;t find a knife . oh .
so anyway ...
hello .
uh , what are you doing ?
just extending the intimacy .
hey , do you want to slip over to the radiation lab
and share a decontamination shower ?
okay , uh , what exactly do you think &apos;s going on between us ?
i &apos;m not sure , but i think i &apos;m about to discover how the bana felt .
but we both understand the biochemistry of sex .
i mean , dopamine in our brains is released across synapses , causing pleasure .
you stick electrodes in a rat &apos;s brain , give him an orgasm button ,
he &apos;ll push that thing until he starves to death .
well , who wouldn &apos;t ?
well , the only difference between us and the rat
is that you can &apos;t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus .
that &apos;s where you come in .
yeah , well , i &apos;m just glad to be a part of it .
so what happens now ?
well , i don &apos;t know about your sex drive , but i &apos;m probably good till new year &apos;s .
oh . okay . thank you .
thank you .
you want to make plans for new year &apos;s ?
whoa , leonard , please . you &apos;re smothering me .
oh . sorry .
hey , look .
it &apos;s dr. stud !
dr. what ?
the blogosphere is a @-@ buzzin &apos;with news of you
and leslie winkle makingeine kleine bang @-@ bangmusik .
what ? how did it get on the internet ?
i put it there .
well , how did you know about it ?
a little bird told us .
apparently , you are a magnificent beast .
that part &apos;s true .
you know , i think i may have misjudged this restaurant .
no kidding .
i don &apos;t want to go out on a limb ,
but i think we may be looking at my new tuesday hamburger .
your old tuesday hamburger will be so brokenhearted .
way ahead of you .
i was thinking of moving big boy to thursdays ,
and just dropping souplantation .
really ? yeah .
the name always confused me anyway .
souplantation .
you can &apos;t grow soup .
so , how &apos;s everything ?
mmm ! terrific .
you &apos;ll be happy to know that i plan to come here every tuesday night
for the foreseeable future .
really ? oh , yay !
who do i speak to about permanently reserving this table ?
um ... i don &apos;t know ... a psychiatrist ?
so , hey
how are things with you and leslie ?
oh , to be honest , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work out .
oh . oh , that &apos;s too bad .
well , hey , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s someone out there who &apos;s just right for you .
what did she mean by that ? !
was that just a generic platitude ,
or was that a subtle bid for attention ?
you know why this hamburger surpasses the big boy ?
this is a single @-@ decker hamburger , whereas the big boy is a double @-@ decker .
this has a much more satisfying meat @-@ to @-@ bun @-@ to @-@ condiment ratio .
are you even listening to me ?
of course , i &apos;m listening .
blah , blah , hopeless penny delusion , blah , blah , blah .
okay , then .
