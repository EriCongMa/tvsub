renee feared ben was cheating .
and with detective vance closing in ...
do you think we need a lawyer ?
lawyers won &apos;t be necessary , ladies .
susan wanted to flee .
if i get caught , i could go away for a lot of years .
lynette went to tom for help .
you can &apos;t go to paris , not now .
i &apos;m an accessory to murder .
carlos disappeared from rehab .
he checked himself out two hours ago .
what ? why didn &apos;t you stop him ?
my unofficial investigation &apos;s about to go official .
but before he could go public ...
and bree decided to end it all .
bree van de kamp
had always wanted to live her life with elegance and grace .
and that is also how she wanted to die .
her plan was to pour herself a glass of her favorite chardonnay ,
put on her most styli n nightgown
and leave behind a note on embossed statioryry .
yes , bree had everything she needed for an elegant death .
everything except ...
privacy .
thank you , but i don &apos;t need turn down service .
come back in the morning ,
and you might wanna bring a mop .
open the door .
renee ?
you have to the count of three . one ...
this isn &apos;t a good time .
two ...
seriously , i &apos;m in the middle of something .
where is he ?
who ?
ben .
the man you &apos;re trying to steal from me .
i don &apos;t understand ..
do you think i won &apos;t hit you ?
i once slapped a waitress
because she forgot my croutons !
you are dead .
renee , please , you have to go .
ever since we met ,
you &apos;ve been spouting those sunday school phrases ,
making folks think you &apos;re this grand lady .
well , i got your number now ,
and you are nothing but a middle @-@ aged skank
in a nancy reagan nightie .
why do you have a gun ?
bree ...
i asked you a question .
why is there a gun on the table ?
no , don &apos;t read that .
bree .
please go .
please .
were you actually gonna ...
oh , my god .
renee perry had no idea
just how close her friend had come to suicide ,
and bree van de kamp had no idea
just how close she had come to being hit .
keeping secrets is a lonely business .
that &apos;s why we all search for someone to confide in--
an alyl who will understand ...
an advisor we can trust ...
a friend who will never judge .
of course , not everyone you tell your secrets to ...
will be happy about it .
good morning .
hey , mom . look who didn &apos;t go to paris .
i know . your dad had to cancel his trip .
because some work meetings came up .
nice for us , huh ?
hey , if you guys are done ,
why don &apos;t you go grab your books ?
and i &apos;ll drop you off at school .
okay .
all right .
no .
co @-@ conspirators to murder do not get pancakes .
i know that this was the last thing you ever expected to have
to deal with-
yeah , you could say that .
how could you let yourself get involved in this ?
it &apos;s--it &apos;s gaby and carlos &apos; mess .
i was ... helping a friend .
oh ! helping a friend .
because when i &apos;d ask you to bring my shirts to the cleaners ,
that was always this big hassle ,
but burying a body in the woods--
hey , would you lower your voice ?
look , i do not know what is supposed to happen now .
and what , is chuck gonna just show up and arrest you ? what ?
he told gaby that
he was starting a formal investigation this morning ,
so ... yes , they could arrest me .
damn it , lynette ! how could you let this happen ? !
out of the four , you &apos;re supposed to be the smart one .
hey , a @-@ are you guys ready ?
yeah , i &apos;ll meet you at the car .
all right .
okay .
i need some support right now , not a lecture .
okay , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry .
i will find a way to fix this .
* ... and now the news . *
* detective charles vance was killed last night in fairview square , *
* an apparent victim of a hit and run . *
* the case is currently under investigation . *
* anyone with information , *
* please contact the fairview police department . *
how could he just check himself out ? !
as i told you on the phone , as i replied to your texts ,
and as i &apos;m telling you in person ,
this is a rehab center , not a jail .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not much of a rehab center
if you let patients out in time for happy hour !
please lower your voice .
you &apos;ll wake the crackheads .
i &apos;m sorry , but do you have any idea how worried i am ?
my husband has been gone all night .
i don &apos;t know where he is or what he &apos;s been doing .
look , even if he did have a relapse , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be back soon .
then we &apos;ll call you at home ,
so you should go there .
could you at least pretend to care ?
not with what i &apos;m paid .
you &apos;re making a big mistake , nursie .
i &apos;ve got a lot of drunk friends ,
and i &apos;m not recommending this place !
* again , our top story-- *
* fairview police detective chuck vance is dead *
* after a hit and run accident *
* that has left the community stunned . *
* detective vance was crossing lake street *
* approximately 11 : 00 p.m. *
* when he was run down by a dark sedan . *
hello , sunshine . how you feelin &apos; this mornin &apos; ?
groggy ... and nauseous .
mm . i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s my fault .
i slipped a few sedatives in your tea last night
and sort of forgot to say &quot; when . &quot;
you drugged me ?
i had to make sure you &apos;d sleep through the night .
didn &apos;t wanna find you sprawled out
on the oriental with your wrists slashed .
spanish omelet ?
if you really want to protect the oriental ...
you &apos;ll put that away .
fine . let me know what you do like for breakfast ,
and i will make that for you tomorrow .
tomorrow ? you &apos;ll be here tomorrow ?
and into the foreseeable future .
didn &apos;t you see my louis vuitton bags upstairs ?
i &apos;m moving in .
no , no , no , no , no .
you--you don &apos;t have to do that .
after what you tried to do last night ,
i don &apos;t have a choice .
but i &apos;m fine .
last night was just a moment of temporary insanity .
in the light of day , i feel absolutely ...
did you take the laces out of all my sneakers ?
yeah , and i also got rid of all your knives , razors ,
pills , cleaning fluid , and your shower curtain .
how could i kill myself with a shower curtain ?
you can &apos;t . i just thought it was ugly .
okay . see , this is why you can &apos;t stay here .
you will drive me absolutely crazy .
mm . i &apos;d rather see you in a straitjacket
than a coffin .
all right , that &apos;s very sweet , but i am fine now .
it &apos;s a brand @-@ new morning , and i am loving life .
okay .
now that you are of sound mind ,
why did you want to kill yourself ?
it &apos;s complicated .
i &apos;m sure it is ,
and i &apos;m also sure i &apos;m not going anywhere
till i know exactly what made you bring a gun to that motel .
renee , please , this is so unnecessary .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i ... just got some bad news about your friend , chuck vance .
susan ?
susan .
can you help me with my bag ?
no ! no , nobody &apos;s helping her with her bag .
mike , you &apos;re supposed to be sleeping .
so are you . where do you think you &apos;re going ?
you know where . new york .
i wrote it all on the note i left on your nightstand .
but i thought--
looking good , mike .
i thought we discussed this last night .
you can &apos;t just pick up and leave like this .
you discussed it . i waited till you went to bed ,
and then i ... reconfirmed my plane reservation .
well , if you &apos;re going , you &apos;re going without clothes .
mike ! wh--
can you wait a sec ?
it feels like you &apos;ve packed for a month .
three weeks .
felix set up meetings with gallery owners ,
and then if all goes well , we can discuss moving there .
i &apos;m not moving to new york .
why not ?
my plumbing business is here .
well , think how much more exciting it &apos;ll be .
you &apos;ll be unclogging pipes in the big city .
okay , just stop . this is not about you becoming an artist .
it &apos;s not ?
no .
it &apos;s about you running away from chuck vance .
okay . you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m a mess .
one more interrogation by chuck ,
and i will crack like an egg , and then i &apos;ll go to jail
and take half the neighborhood with me .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t risk it .
you have to let me go .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
oh , my god . chuck &apos;s dead ?
it was some sort of hit and run . that &apos;s--that &apos;s all we know .
so ... what happens now ?
nothing . it &apos;s all good .
the only person tying us
to alejandro &apos;s murder is gone .
gaby , he was bree &apos;s boyfriend .
yeah , and if she &apos;d dumped him when i told her ,
we wouldn &apos;t have gotten in trouble in the first place .
if you &apos;re done , i think it &apos;s time
that we ask the obvious question .
which is ?
did somebody do this on purpose ?
oh , my god . he was murdered ?
no ! no , no , no , no , no . it was an accident .
it does seem a bit ... convenient .
well , maybe god decided
to answer our prayers
through one of his drunk @-@ driving angels on earth .
who are we to question god ?
look , okay , i admit we were in a lot of trouble there ,
but none of us are that cold @-@ blooded , right ?
could it be someone &apos;s trying to protect us ?
oh , my god . carlos .
hey . carlos couldn &apos;t have done it .
he &apos;s still in rehab , isn &apos;t he ?
of course he is ! oh , my god , you guys .
we finally get a lucky break . let &apos;s just go with it .
we wanted chuck gone , and now he &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s just a coincidence .
coincidence ?
yes , bree , coincidences happen ,
otherwise there wouldn &apos;t be a word for them .
so , uh , i guess we should just put this behind us
and ... get back to normal .
sounds like a plan .
are we good , susan ?
sure .
bree ?
we all agree this was just an accident ?
if you say so .
tom ? tom , i &apos;ve got big news !
you are not gonna believe what has happened to--
bob ?
what did you do ?
you buried a man in the woods ?
she was merely helping a friend . don &apos;t forget that .
you t @-@ told bob ?
of course i told bob . if they arrest you ,
you &apos;re gonna need an attorney .
tom , i just found out that everybody i invited
to my last barbecue
is involved in murder ,
and this is water .
scotch . coming right up .
you shouldn &apos;t have done that . we don &apos;t need a lawyer .
we have to prepare for the worst , lynette .
i am not gonna have the kids visit you behind bars
next mother &apos;s day .
no , no , listen to me .
chuck vance died last night .
what ?
hit by a car .
oh , my god ! was that you guys , too ?
no !
are you serious ?
and--and chuck was the only one who knew about the ...
yeah .
okay .
so , bob ...
i guess we &apos;re not gonna need you after all .
but if you want ,
you can totally bill me for this hour .
count on it .
taking this scotch .
so it &apos;s over ?
i think so .
okay , what &apos;s wrong ?
the one man who could have put us all in jail is gone .
we &apos;re home free ,
but you &apos;re still sitting there ,
more depressed than ever .
i &apos;d like to know why .
i don &apos;t know .
are you ... upset that chuck got killed ?
a little .
not so much .
well , then why are you getting all misty ?
i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you ?
why are you getting mad ?
because we &apos;ve been riding this emotional roller coaster
for months now ,
and i &apos;m ready to get off .
well , i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;m not all giggles and sunshine ,
but i am walking around with a pretty big secret .
so what ? everybody &apos;s got a secret .
not as big as mine . i helped bury a body .
and our mechanic does crystal meth .
our butcher beats up homeless guys ,
and the librarian &apos;s a nymphomaniac .
the world is filled with ordinary people that do nasty things .
so man up or dump the guilt .
let &apos;s get on with our lives .
i know you &apos;re right . uh ...
it makes no sense for me to be depressed ,
and i know alejandro was a bad guy .
and he deserved to die .
he did . he absolutely did .
why are you still so ...
i don &apos;t know .
but i &apos;ll figure it out . i swear .
thank you .
our librarian &apos;s a nymphomaniac ?
i made that up .
&apos;cause i always got a vibe .
let &apos;s just eat .
detective murphy ?
yeah .
hi . i just wanted to stop by and say how sorry i was
to hear about officer vance .
it &apos;s so tragic . any idea who could have done this ?
who are you ?
oh , i &apos;m gabrielle solis .
i met chuck through his
girlfriend , bree van de kamp .
she &apos;s a friend of mine .
woman &apos;s a first class bitch .
who i rarely talk to &apos; cause of the bitch thing .
so , um , were there any witnesses ?
everyone here knows what she did to chuck--
led him on and then broke his heart like it was nothing .
can &apos;t believe he wanted to marry her .
yeah , i know .
marrying bree would have been the worst thing
to ever happen to him .
well , second worst .
so any clues-- anything at all ?
not yet . excuse me .
well , you know what i think happened ?
drunk teenagers hitting people with cars .
yeah .
it &apos;s a rite of passage with them , like spring break .
if i were you guys , i &apos;d be checking the grills
of every acne @-@ covered kid within a 100 @-@ mile radius .
it wasn &apos;t an accident .
it wasn &apos;t ?
there were no skid marks ,
no attempt to slow down or swerve .
whoever did this was gunning for chuck .
so ... anyone get the make of the car
or ... race of the driver ?
no , ma &apos;am , but we &apos;re monitoring
every body shop in the state .
oh . okay .
don &apos;t worry . a cop was killed .
we &apos;ll find whoever &apos;s responsible ,
and when we do , they are gonna pay ,
big @-@ time .
okay .
i &apos;ll be sure to tell bree .
that bitch !
how &apos;s the history project coming ?
good . i &apos;m drawing a picture of lincoln &apos;s assassination .
sweetie , i don &apos;t think he was shot with a stapler .
that &apos;s a gun , and i think we &apos;re done here .
sorry for just dropping by without calling ,
especially with the way things have been between us lately .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s this whole chuck thing .
hey , penny , would you mind throwing those clothes
in the washing machine for me ?
sure .
thanks .
come on in .
you don &apos;t think it was an accident , do you ?
no .
who could do something like that ?
it had to be someone who was trying to protect us .
but that means they would have to know about what we did .
who else knows ? i mean ,
other than the four of us and carlos ?
well , susan told mike .
and i told ben .
and i told tom .
you told tom ?
well , you told ben .
okay , so ben and mike and tom ,
but that &apos;s it , right ?
no one else has been told ?
no one .
except tom told bob .
we &apos;re gonna need to write this down .
okay , the people who were there are in orange .
the people who were told by people who were there are in blue ,
and the green arrows represent who told whom .
wow . we may be good at arts and crafts ,
but we suck at conspiracy .
what &apos;s the purple question mark ?
that &apos;s whoever wrote the letter .
you think they killed chuck ?
who knows ? we &apos;re not sure why the letter
was sent in the first place .
&quot; i know what you did . it makes me sick .
i &apos;m going to tell &quot; ? sounds like a threat to me .
but why kill someone else
who has the same goal ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
none of it makes any sense .
i mean , we know these people .
none of them would commit a cold @-@ blooded murder .
oh , god .
what if someone else knows ?
hey . how are the girls ?
juanita demanded ice cream for lunch .
what &apos;d you say ?
she &apos;s bigger than me . what do you think i said ?
and don &apos;t give me that look .
you said you &apos;d be home by feeding time .
sorry . i &apos;ve been all over town looking for my husband .
carlos went a.w.o.l. from rehab last night ,
and i have no idea where he is .
want a hint ?
you know ?
he dragged his can upstairs about two hours ago ,
drunk as a red sox pitcher in the bottom of the 9th .
karen , i don &apos;t know how to thank you .
i &apos;m on a fixed income . let &apos;s use our imagination ?
oh , thank god ! i was so worried !
where were you last night ?
you can tell me the truth . i won &apos;t judge .
i &apos;ll be totally supportive .
wake up , you pathetic boozehound !
where the hell were you last night ? !
oh , where am i now ?
ohh ! i &apos;m home !
no , no , no , no , no , no . open your eyes . focus .
okay , after you checked yourself out of rehab ,
you got in the car . where did you go ?
i drove to a bar .
i drank a lot of shots ...
and i don &apos;t remember much else .
do you remember killing someone ?
oh , look who &apos;s sober now .
what are you talking about ?
chuck vance was killed last night
by a hit and run driver .
chuck &apos;s dead ?
and you think i did it ?
you think i killed someone ?
ahem . alejandro .
it &apos;s not like potato chips , gaby !
you were upset , and you were drinking .
he was hit on lake street .
that &apos;s only a few blocks from the rehab center .
i don &apos;t remember .
you have to .
the police are all over this thing .
they &apos;re looking for witnesses . they &apos;re trying to find the car .
oh , wait . that &apos;s it . the car .
all we have to do is check the car .
if you hit him , it &apos;ll be obvious .
honey , where &apos;s your car ?
that &apos;s a really good question .
why did you turn the light on ?
i &apos;m checking up on you . how you doing ?
fine .
really ?
&apos;cause last night you were suicidal ,
and that was before you found out your boyfriend was dead .
i would think you &apos;d be an emotional mess right about now .
it &apos;s been an interesting couple of days ,
but i &apos;m holding my own .
see , here &apos;s my problem .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you don &apos;t have to believe me .
all you have to do is turn off the light
as you leave the room .
bree , you need to talk about this .
repressing your feelings is not healthy .
and since when are you a therapist ?
uh , excuse me . i took intro to psych
and once slept with my shrink . i think i &apos;m qualified .
well , as impressive as those credentials are ,
my feelings are not your concern .
they became my concern when i caught you
about to swallow the business end of a smith &amp; wesson .
now i &apos;m not leaving this room until you tell me why .
i can &apos;t .
other people are involved-- people that you know .
well ... i can keep my mouth shut .
renee ...
oh , you can trust me . we &apos;re friends , right ?
not really .
not really ?
i &apos;m not trying to be rude . yes , i mean , we &apos;re--
well , we socialize . you &apos;ve been to my home .
i &apos;ve been to yours . we &apos;re friendly ,
but that doesn &apos;t make us friends .
okay .
you know what i mean .
you and i don &apos;t talk about important things .
we &apos;ve never had a deep conversation .
we &apos;re not ...
friends .
and now i &apos;ve upset you , and that wasn &apos;t my intention .
don &apos;t worry about me . i &apos;m fine .
and by the way ,
i don &apos;t think you have any friends .
in fact , i don &apos;t think you care about anyone at all ,
because if you did , you never would have considered
splattering your brains against the wall of some cheap motel .
okay , that &apos;s it . would you please get out of my house ?
no ! not until i &apos;m convinced you are no longer
a danger to yourself .
i will not allow anyone to kill themselves ,
not on my watch .
i will not go through that again .
this is a funeral .
you have got to stop smiling .
sorry .
i &apos;m just so relieved .
i really thought i was dead in the water there .
yeah , we were very lucky .
listen , i can &apos;t thank you enough
for everything you have done for me .
it &apos;s no big deal .
one minute you &apos;re boarding a plane to paris ,
then the next , you rush to my side .
well , you do know in spite of everything ,
you still mean the world to me .
if i didn &apos;t before , i do now .
hey , i @-@ i know it &apos;s not paris ,
but you wanna come over later for movie night with the kids ?
that &apos;d be great .
i &apos;ll bring a pizza so you don &apos;t have to cook .
fantastic .
lynette .
sorry .
here you go , dear .
oh . thank you .
i can &apos;t believe i forgot to bring tissue to a funeral .
oh , you keep it . i don &apos;t really cry at funerals ,
not anymore .
no .
well , when you &apos;re young ,
death always comes as such a shock ,
as if the universe is unfair .
but when you get to my age ,
you realize that death is just the end of the story .
the phone call comes .
you shed a few tears ,
and then you get together
and celebrate the life that was .
that &apos;s it .
what ?
thank you so much !
you will never know how helpful you &apos;ve been .
oh , i &apos;m so glad .
were you close with my nephew ?
oh , no . oh .
but he did interrogate me once .
he did a lovely job .
hey , gaby , you got a minute ?
listen .
what was alejandro &apos;s alias ?
seriously ? we &apos;re talking about this here ?
chuck told me in my interrogation ,
but i can &apos;t remember .
pablo ? paco ?
ramon ranchez .
right , right , and he was living in ...
oklahoma city . what do you need this for ?
i ... w @-@ wanna light a candle for him ,
and i thought i should know all of his names .
you only light candles for people who you want to bless .
that &apos;s right , and he was a bad guy .
i &apos;m gonna go blow out that candle .
what the hell are we doing here ?
there are cops everywhere .
it &apos;s a cop funeral . what &apos;d you expect ? clowns ?
i am taking a huge risk by being here .
no , you &apos;re paying your respects .
that &apos;s what innocent people do .
okay .
if i &apos;m so innocent ,
then why is that cop staring at me ?
just stop acting so guilty .
he takes one look at your face ,
and you say--
hi , officer .
hello . carlos , right ? remember me ?
no .
i &apos;m not surprised . you were pretty wasted
when you came into the station the other night .
you went to the police station ?
yeah . he said he wanted to make a confession--
something about beating somebody with a candlestick ?
oh , carlos , you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
what else did he say ?
well , that &apos;s when the news came in about detective vance ,
and , uh , all hell broke loose .
by the time things settled , he was gone .
so who &apos;s this person you assaulted ?
that would be me .
you ?
yeah . i &apos;m a bit of a handful .
you hit your wife with a candlestick ?
he hit me back .
in his defense , i &apos;d just popped him with a baseball bat .
so do you wanna file charges ?
or do you ?
oh ! we &apos;re good .
this thing we got isn &apos;t pretty , but it works .
so who was it ?
who was what ?
the person you knew who committed suicide .
that &apos;s something i only discuss with friends .
it was my mother .
she &apos;d tried it once before .
pills .
but i found her in time .
and then ...
one morning i saw that look in her eyes again .
not ... sad , just ...
empty .
she swore to me she &apos;d be fine , so i ...
i went to school .
and by the time i got back ...
well ... how was i supposed to know
she was gonna pull it off this time ?
oh , renee , i am so sorry .
yeah .
that &apos;s what the note said--
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
i don &apos;t have a mom for the rest of my life ,
and she thinks those two little words ...
are gonna make up for that ?
many years ago ,
a neighbor and a good friend of ours ...
took her life .
and that left us all heartbroken and perplexed .
but somehow , when i was alone in that hotel room ,
i forgot about all the pain she caused .
in those awful moments ,
i thought maybe she had the answer .
but then you showed up . thank god .
you will always be the person who saved my life .
and now that i &apos;ve had time to think about it ...
i realize that makes you the best friend i &apos;ll ever have .
hey ! look who &apos;s here with a pizza and a dvd .
ooh , mario &apos;s . that &apos;s excellent .
mom , you let dad pick out the movie ?
hey , my taste in movies is as good as my taste in pizza .
great , that means the pizza &apos;s gonna be black and white
and three hours long .
oh , excuse me .
&quot; citizen kane , &quot; &quot; marty , &quot; &quot; casablanca &quot; --
what do all these movies have in common ?
we fell asleep during them ?
they &apos;re classics .
&quot; here &apos;s looking at you , kid . &quot;
here &apos;s looking at my iphone , dad .
hey ! be nice . i &apos;m sure your dad picked out
something really fun this time . what &apos;d you get ?
&quot; old yeller . &quot;
oh , tom , you make this so hard .
why ? what i &apos;ve seen of it is great .
my folks always sent me to bed before the ending .
is there--is there swearing or something ?
something . how about we eat ?
everything good ?
yeah . it &apos;s just , you never remember i like the thin crust .
but it doesn &apos;t matter . thank you for getting it .
who &apos;s hungry ?
oh , i am .
good news . the police found the car .
you left it in their parking lot .
thank god .
mrs. mccluskey &apos;s gonna
drive us over there after breakfast ,
then i will drive you back to rehab .
sounds like a plan .
babe .
i &apos;m sorry about all this .
i know i &apos;ve put you and the kids through so much .
i &apos;m gonna try and get back here as soon as i can .
you forget about us .
you just worry about getting better .
i can hold down the fort . no problem .
i have something else i need to tell you .
what &apos;s that ?
i love you .
i know you know that .
i just don &apos;t think we say it enough .
i love you , too .
one more thing .
what ?
if you ever go to the police again
and confess something without talking to me first ,
i will be burying another body in the woods .
you got it ?
good .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
hey , you want a beer ?
oh , you got the belgian kind ?
i love that stuff .
i know .
thanks for clearing the table .
i believe that has been the hardest part of our separation .
god , for me ? it &apos;s the laundry .
i @-@ i found out i am more inclined to buy new socks ...
than to wash the dirty ones .
hey , thanks again for giving up your trip .
it really meant a lot to me .
no problem .
and please apologize to jane .
she must be furious .
i doubt it . she &apos;s not really like that .
tom , i know women .
there &apos;s a lynette voodoo doll
being dropped off the eiffel tower as we speak .
no , it &apos;s weird , but , uh ,
jane doesn &apos;t hang on to anger .
ah . uh , okay .
you don &apos;t--you don &apos;t-- you don &apos;t know her .
she &apos;s-- she &apos;s very forgiving .
ah . fine . got it . she &apos;s terrific .
well , i &apos;ll give you an example .
she would never criticize the pizza i brought over .
what ?
well , you had to point out that i didn &apos;t get the thin crust .
i know , i know . the second i said it ,
i realized i shouldn &apos;t have . it just ... came out .
exactly . it &apos;s just a-- it &apos;s a reflex for you .
you can &apos;t help it .
well ...
maybe that &apos;s because i keep hoping
if i say something enough , you &apos;ll finally hear me .
i mean ...
23 years of telling you the kind of pizza i like ,
and it still doesn &apos;t occur to you to get it .
it makes me feel like i don &apos;t matter .
wow , i didn &apos;t realize .
i know .
i shouldn &apos;t have compared you to jane .
that wasn &apos;t right .
that &apos;s okay .
she &apos;s really good to you , huh ?
then i think you should go to paris .
what ?
yeah .
&apos;cause otherwise , you &apos;ll always wonder
if she could make you happy .
and didn &apos;t we say that was the point of us separating ?
could i still stay and watch the movie ?
of course .
susan ?
you gotta be kidding me .
susan , what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
oh , i remember this house .
the half naked guy runs out , and i don &apos;t get my fare .
here . huh ?
oh , no , no , put that back . you &apos;ll get your fare this time .
honey , i &apos;m sorry , but i have to go .
i @-@ it &apos;s all in my note .
what is it with you and notes lately ?
you were asleep when i came home from the funeral .
well , if you &apos;re taking off to new york , you wake me up !
i &apos;m not going to new york .
i &apos;m going to oklahoma .
and now i &apos;m ... just confused .
okay , two minutes .
you asked me why i still feel so guilty .
i finally figured it out . he got a phone call .
who got a phone call ?
alejandro .
when we were putting his body into the ground ,
his phone rang . do you know what that means ?
he had really good cell phone service ?
it means he has a family ,
and they have no idea where he is .
it must be tearing them apart .
i mean , he did something horrible , not them .
they shouldn &apos;t have to suffer , too .
and what exactly are you gonna do about it ?
i &apos;m not sure yet .
i just know i have to see if they &apos;re okay .
i think it &apos;s the only way
i &apos;m ever getting back to normal .
well , then i guess you gotta go .
hey ! where are you off to ?
i &apos;m just ... visiting some family .
oh , that sounds like fun . well , have a good trip .
it &apos;s a lonely business keeping secrets .
that &apos;s why we all search for someone we can confide in ...
an ally who will understand .
an advisor we can trust .
a friend who will never judge .
yes , we all need help hiding
the darkest truths of our lives .
because as soon as you &apos;ve told one secret ...
