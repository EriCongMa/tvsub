this loft has devolved into chaos .
you promised me if we had sex this morning ,
you wouldn &apos;t get riled up .
sex was great . blessings . but look at all this mail .
small @-@ time drug dealers are more organized than this .
oh , my god , my uncle lee got married .
this is what i &apos;m talking about .
oh , my god , he died .
cece , what if that had been one of your college acceptance letters ?
i &apos;m transferring to a four year university .
it &apos;s no big deal .
it &apos;s huge .
you graduated from a community college .
it was a sight to behold .
cece parikh .
that &apos;s me .
i &apos;m not gonna let you lose out because our roommates
are a bunch of railway cats .
clear your schedule . we &apos;re organizing .
can &apos;t . i &apos;m campaigning with jess today .
let &apos;s get ready to rodham !
y &apos;all ready for this ... election ?
what on earth are you celebrating ?
it &apos;s okay . we know you &apos;re voting for trump .
not on your life , nor am i voting for that flip @-@ flopping
helmet head in a pantsuit .
i &apos;m only focused on one election .
the election that matters : paul ryan 2020 .
all right . while you sit this one out ,
cece and i are gonna register new voters
and help hillary prove that a woman &apos;s place is in the house ...
the white house .
the people &apos;s voice must be heard
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve always believed .
as i see it , we have two choices .
continue eating this pig slop
that they call butterscotch pudding
or we can raise our voices and demand
for locally @-@ sourced , candied , oregon apples !
you can silence me , but you can &apos;t silence the people !
this is not p.s. hippie montessori .
nobody cares anymore . democracy is dead .
if you get five new voters ,
hell , you know what , i &apos;ll vote for hillary .
excuse me ?
things ... just ... got ... interesting .
but if you don &apos;t , you have to vote for winston .
bishop ?
winston bishop ?
game on , you republican minx .
hey , guys , if i win , i just want you to know
there will be some things that come out about me .
just ride it out .
reagan &apos;s in seattle . aly &apos;s at quantico .
and here we are , you and me ,
working that long &quot; d. &quot;
the long what now ? we &apos;re working the what ?
the long &quot; d. &quot; long distance relationships .
i mean , aly and i have got it down to an art .
really ? &apos; cause i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m really struggling .
in new orleans , reagan and i had such an easy time talking ,
but now there &apos;s so much pressure that we just text .
just talk on the phone .
i hate talking on the phone , winston .
i feel like i &apos;m exposing my turd pipe .
what ?
i just know that i feel cold and i &apos;m terrified .
look , man , you got to understand something about the long &quot; d. &quot;
at first , it &apos;s very hard .
okay ? it &apos;s a lot to take .
but the long &quot; d &quot; in the end is ...
very much worth it .
you have to see what you &apos;re doing here .
right now you &apos;re having problems .
i &apos;m not . you know why ?
&apos;cause you love the long &quot; d. &quot;
i &apos;ve adjusted to the long &quot; d. &quot;
okay .
sometimes it &apos;s rough .
yeah , can be bumpy road sometimes , man .
the long &quot; d &quot; can be bumpy .
sometimes there &apos;s unexpected curves .
don &apos;t i know it .
but once it breaks you down a little bit ,
you learn to like the long &quot; d. &quot;
you &apos;re gonna say something like that ?
you get used to it is what i &apos;m saying .
i think i &apos;m done with this .
hello .
hello .
two canvassers reporting for duty .
jessica day , school administrator .
cecilia parikh , community college graduate ,
soon to be transferred to a four year university .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
well , actually she doesn &apos;t know
which one yet .
yeah , i haven &apos;t been accepted .
i don &apos;t have time to listen to you .

hi . hey .
hello . good day .

what is so genius about the new system
is that it &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory .
now , let &apos;s say you get a heating bill .
where does it go ?
didn &apos;t know i was gonna be quizzed .
loft bills .
that &apos;s right .

phone sex is old school .

she &apos;d be like , &quot; my bloom ... bloomers .

i did exceed expectations .
mm . but you know what ?
we need to get off the bench
and we need to go prove schmidt wrong .

and i know just the tired ,
cranky broad who has one .

i couldn &apos;t see the smug look on schmidt &apos;s face ,
but i could feel it .
i &apos;ll be damned if i cast a vote for bishop / furguson .
wait , where @-@ where are you going ?
back to the coven of greek sirens .
i say we go in hard ,
with the violent history of the suffragette ,
and then , we ease into some light reproductive rights .
that is one way to do it .
or ...
who &apos;s ready to party ?
and gab about the kind of world
we want to leave our grandchildren !
hopefully one that &apos;s full of parties !
you &apos;re gonna graduate soon , okay ?
so , this is your turn to really speak up and make a difference ...

i love you , booze girl . take a shot !
oh , no . i don &apos;t ...

i don &apos;t want to take a shot ,

i can &apos;t sign it if you don &apos;t take a shot .
that &apos;s such a good argument . okay .
all right .
you all have ten shots and i have one .
but , if you share the wealth ,
then we can all throw up together .
and that &apos;s called redistribution .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying !

when schmidt opened my letter ,
i could hear the excitement in his voice ,
and i could see it in your face , but--
cece ...
i felt nothing .
schmidt , please talk some sense to your wife .
she says she doesn &apos;t want to go to college ,
but tell her that a four @-@ year education--
no , okay , look , jess , jess ,
i know school is your life , okay ,
and i respect that , you know that i do ,
but we &apos;re different people .
i don &apos;t want to be stuck in a classroom .
i want to be out in the world working with people .
i just really need you both to support me .
i support you . i will always support you .
i mean , this sort of ruins my dream of ...
taking you in a dorm room , but ...

and i &apos;m scared to ask
what is your platform ?
well , first of all , i just want to say
that my portrait , it will be silly .

to something like this .
america ...
schmidt , please don &apos;t make me do this .
i have to vote for hillary .
get , get , get ,
