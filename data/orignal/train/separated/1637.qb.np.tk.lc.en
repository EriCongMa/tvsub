so if a photon is directed through a plane
with two slits in it and either slit is observed ,
it will not go through both slits .
if it &apos;s unobserved , it will .
however , if it &apos;s observed after it &apos;s left the plane
but before it hits its target ,
it won &apos;t have gone through both slits .
agreed. what &apos;s your point ?
there &apos;s no point , i just think it &apos;s a good idea for a t @-@ shirt .
excuse me .
hang on .
one across is &quot; aegean . &quot;
eight down is &quot; nabokov . &quot;
26 across is &quot; mcm . &quot;
14 down is ... move your finger ...
&quot; phylum &quot; which makes 14 across &quot; port @-@ au @-@ prince &quot;
see , &quot; papa doc &apos;s capitol idea , &quot; that &apos;s &quot; port @-@ au @-@ prince . &quot;
haiti .
can i help you ?
yes .
is this the high @-@ iq sperm bank ?
if you have to ask , maybe you shouldn &apos;t be here .
i think this is the place .
fill these out .
thank you .
we &apos;ll be right back .
take your time .
i &apos;ll just finish my crossword puzzle .
oh , wait .
leonard , i don &apos;t think i can do this .
what , are you kidding ? you &apos;re a semi @-@ pro .
no. we are committing genetic fraud .
there &apos;s no guarantee that our sperm
is going to generate high @-@ iqoffspring .
think about that . i have a sister with the same basic dna mix
who hostesses at fuddruckers .
sheldon , this was your idea .
a little extra money to get
fractional t @-@ 1 bandwidth in the apartment .
i know , and i do yearn for faster downloads .
but there &apos;s some poor woman
who &apos;s gonna pin her hopes on my sperm .
what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn &apos;t know if he should use
an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve ?
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll still love him .
i wouldn &apos;t .
well , what do you want to do ?
i want to leave .
what &apos;s the protocol for leaving ?
i don &apos;t know ... i &apos;ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before .
let &apos;s try just walking out .
bye .
bye. nice meeting you .
are you still mad about the sperm bank ?
no .
you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs ?
not really .
if the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimeters ,
most people will trip .
i don &apos;t care .
two milli ... that doesn &apos;t seem right .
no , it &apos;s true , i did a series of experiments when i was 12
my father broke his clavicle .
is that why they sent you to boarding school ?
no. that was a result of my work with lasers .
new neighbor ?
evidently .
significant improvement over the old neighbor .
200 @-@ pound transvestite with a skin condition ?
yes , she is .
oh , hi .
hi .
we don &apos;t mean to interrupt. we live across the hall .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
we don &apos;t live together . i mean ...
we live together ,
but in separate , heterosexual bedrooms .
okay , well ...
guess i &apos;m your new neighbor. penny .
leonard. sheldon .
hi .
well ...
welcome to the building .
thank you. maybe we can have coffee sometime .
great .
well ... bye .
bye .
should we have invited her for lunch ?
no.we &apos;re gonna start season two of battlestar galactica .
we already watched the season two dvds .
not with commentary .
i think we should be good neighbors
and invite her over , make her feel welcome .
we never invited louie @-@ slash @-@ louise over .
and that was wrong of us .
we need to widen our circle .
i have a very wide circle .
i have 212 friends on myspace .
yes , and you &apos;ve never met one of them .
that &apos;s the beauty of it .
i &apos;m gonna invite her over .
we &apos;ll have a nice meal and ... chat .
chat ? we don &apos;t chat. at least not offline .
it &apos;s not difficult .
you just listen to what she says
and then you say something appropriate in response .
to what end ?
hi ... again .
hi .
anyway ...
we brought home indian food .
and ...
i know that moving can be stressful ,
and i find that when i &apos;m undergoing stress ,
that good food and company can have a comforting effect .
also , curry is a natural laxative , and i don &apos;t have to tell you
that , you know , a clean colon is just ...
one less thing to worry about .
i &apos;m no expert , but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation ,
you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements .
you &apos;re inviting me over to eat ?
yes .
oh , that &apos;s so nice . i &apos;d love to .
great .
so , what do you guys do for fun around here ?
today we tried masturbating for money .
okay , make yourself at home .
thank you .
you &apos;re very welcome .
this looks like some serious stuff .
leonard , did you do this ?
actually , that &apos;s my work .
yeah. well , it &apos;s just some quantum mechanics
with a little string theory doodling around the edges .
that part there , that &apos;s just a joke .
it &apos;s a spoof of the born @-@ oppenheimer approximation .
so you &apos;re like one of those beautiful mind genius guys .
yeah .
this is really impressive .
i have a board .
if you like boards , this is my board .
holy smokes .
if by &quot; holy smokes , &quot; you mean
a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff
you can find scribbled on the wall of any men &apos;s room at mit , sure .
what ?
come on .
who hasn &apos;t seen this differential below &quot; here i sit , broken @-@ hearted &quot; ?
at least i didn &apos;t have to invent 26 dimensions
just to make the math come out .
i didn &apos;t invent them. they &apos;re there .
in what universe ?
in all of them ... that is the point .
do you guys mind if i start ?
penny ...
that &apos;s where l sit .
so , sit next to me .
no ... i sit there .
what &apos;s the difference ?
what &apos;s the difference ?
here we go .
in the winter , that seat is close enough to the radiator
to remain warm , and yet not so close as to cause perspiration
in the summer , it &apos;s directly in the path of a cross @-@ breeze
created by opening windows there and there .
it faces the television at an angle
that is neither direct , thus discouraging conversation ,
nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion .
i could go on , but i think i &apos;ve made my point .
do you want me to move ?
well ... -just sit somewhere else .
fine .
sheldon , sit !
well , this is nice .
we don &apos;t have a lot of company over .
that &apos;s not true. koothrappali and wolowitz come over all the time .
yes i know , but ...
tuesday night ,
we played klingon boggle till 1 : 00 a.m.
yeah , i remember .
don &apos;t say we don &apos;t have company .
sorry .
that has negative social implications .
i said i &apos;m sorry !
klingon boggle ?
yeah. it &apos;s like regular boggle , but ...
in klingon .
that &apos;s probably enough about us. so , tell us about you .
me ? okay .
i &apos;m a sagittarius ,
which probably tells you way more than you need to know .
yes. it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion
that the sun &apos;s apparent position
relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality .
participate in the what ?
i think what sheldon &apos;s trying to say
is that sagittarius wouldn &apos;t have been our first guess .
yeah , a lot of people think i &apos;m a water sign .
okay , let &apos;s see , what else .
i &apos;m a vegetarian. except for fish .
and the occasional steak . i love steak !
well , that &apos;s interesting .
leonard can &apos;t process corn .
well ... do you have some sort of a job ?
yeah . i &apos;m a waitress at the cheesecake factory .
i love cheesecake .
you &apos;re lactose @-@ intolerant .
i don &apos;t eat it ... i just think it &apos;s a good idea .
anyways , i &apos;m also writing a screenplay .
it &apos;s about this sensitive girl who comes to l.a. from lincoln , nebraska ,
to be an actress and winds up a waitress at the cheesecake factory .
so , it &apos;s based on your life .
no , i &apos;m from omaha .
if that was movie , i would go see it .
i know , right ?
okay , let &apos;s see , what else ...
guess that &apos;s about it .
that &apos;s the story of penny .
it sounds wonderful .
it was .
until i fell in love with a jerk !
what &apos;s happening ?
god , you know , 4 years i lived with him .
4 years ... that &apos;s like as long as high school .
it took you 4 years to get through high school ?
it just ... i can &apos;t believe i trusted him .
should i say something ? i feel like i should say something .
you ? no , you &apos;ll only make it worse .
you want to know the most pathetic part ?
even though i hate his lying , cheating guts ...
i still love him .
is that crazy ?
yes .
no , it &apos;s not crazy. it &apos;s a ...
it &apos;s a paradox .
paradoxes are part of nature. think about light .
if you look at huygens , light is a wave ,
as confirmed by the double @-@ slit experiments ,
but then along comes albert einstein
and discovers that light behaves like particles , too .
well , i didn &apos;t make it worse .
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m such a mess .
on top of everything else , i &apos;m all gross from moving
and my stupid shower doesn &apos;t even work .
our shower works .
really ? would it be totally weird if i used it ?
yes .
no .
no .
no .
it &apos;s right down the hall .
thanks .
you guys are really sweet .
well , this is an interesting development .
how so ?
it has been some time since we &apos;ve had a woman
take her clothes off in our apartment .
that &apos;s not true. remember at thanksgiving ,
my grandmother with alzheimer &apos;s had that episode ?
point taken. it has been some time
since we &apos;ve had a woman take her clothes off ,
after which we didn &apos;t want to rip our eyes out .
the worst part was watching her carve that turkey .
so what exactly are you trying to accomplish here ?
excuse me ?
that woman is not going to have sex with you .
i &apos;m not trying to have sex with her .
good. then you won &apos;t be disappointed .
what makes you think she wouldn &apos;t have sex with me ?
i &apos;m a male and she &apos;s a female .
yes , but not of the same species .
i &apos;m not going to engage in hypotheticals here .
i &apos;m just trying to be a good neighbor .
of course .
that &apos;s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop ,
that i wouldn &apos;t participate .
however briefly .
do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered
when she discovers your luke skywalker no @-@ more @-@ tears shampoo ?
it &apos;s darth vader shampoo .
luke skywalker &apos;s the conditioner .
wait till you see this .
it &apos;s fantastic , unbelievable .
see what ?
it &apos;s a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974 .
this isn &apos;t a good time .
it &apos;s before he became a creepy computer voice .
that &apos;s great. you guys have to go .
why ?
it &apos;s just not a good time .
leonard has a lady over .
yeah , right ... your grandmother back in town ?
no . and she &apos;s not a lady. she &apos;s just a new neighbor .
hang on , there really is a lady here ?
and you want us out because you &apos;re anticipating coitus ?
i &apos;m not anticipating coitus .
so she &apos;s available for coitus ?
can we please just stop saying &quot; coitus &quot; ?
technically , that would be &quot; coitus interruptus . &quot;
hey , is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower ... ?
hi. sorry. hello .
enchant ? mademoiselle .
howard wolowitz , caltech department of applied physics .
you may be familiar with some of my work .
it &apos;s currently orbiting jupiter &apos;s largest moon
taking high @-@ resolution digital photographs .
penny . i work at the cheesecake factory .
i &apos;ll show you the trick with the shower .
bonne douche .
i &apos;m sorry ?
it &apos;s french for &quot; good shower . &quot;
it &apos;s a sentiment i can express in six languages .
save it for your blog , howard .
all right , there it goes. it sticks . i &apos;m sorry .
okay , thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
you &apos;re just gonna to step right ... okay , i &apos;ll ...
hey , leonard ?
the hair products are sheldon &apos;s .
can i ask you a favor ?
a favor ?
sure , you can ask me a favor . i would do you a favor for you .
it &apos;s okay if you say no .
i &apos;ll probably say yes .
it &apos;s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met .
i really think we should examine the chain of causality here .
must we ?
event a ...
a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower .
event b ... we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set
from the aforementioned woman &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend .
query ... on what plane of existence
is there even a semi @-@ rational link between these events ?
she asked me to do her a favor , sheldon .
yes , well , that may be the proximal cause of our journey ,
but we both know it only exists in contradistinction
to the higher level distal cause .
which is ?
you think with your penis .
that &apos;s a biological impossibility. and you didn &apos;t have to come .
right , i could have stayed behind and watch wolowitz try to hit on penny
in russian , arabic and farsi .
why can &apos;t she get her own tv ?
come on , you know how it is with breakups .
no , i don &apos;t ... and neither do you .
i broke up with joyce kim .
you did not break up with joyce kim. she defected to north korea .
to mend her broken heart .
this situation is much less complicated .
there &apos;s some kind of dispute between penny and her ex @-@ boyfriend
as to who gets custody of the tv .
she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him .
so we get to have a scene with him ?
no , there &apos;s not going to be a scene .
there &apos;s two of us and one of him .
leonard , the two of us can &apos;t even carry a tv .
so , you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university ?
i &apos;m sorry , do you speak english ?
he speaks english. he just can &apos;t speak to women .
really ? why ?
he &apos;s kind of a nerd .
juice box ?
i &apos;ll do the talking .
yeah ?
hi , i &apos;m leonard , this is sheldon .
hello .
what did i just--
we &apos;re here to pick up penny &apos;s tv .
get lost .
okay , thanks for you time .
we &apos;re not going to give up just like that .
leonard , the tv &apos;s in the building .
we &apos;ve been denied access to the building , ergo , we are done .
excuse me. if i were to give up on the first little hitch ,
i never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory
in the aftermath of the big bang .
my apologies. what &apos;s your plan ?
it &apos;s just a privilege to watch your mind at work .
come on , we have a combined iq of 360 .
we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building .
what do you think their combined iq is ?
just grab the door !
this is it .
i &apos;ll do the talking .
good thinking . i &apos;ll just be the muscle .
yeah ?
i &apos;m leonard , this is sheldon .
from the intercom .
how the hell did you get in the building ?
we &apos;re scientists .
tell him about our iq .
leonard ...
what ?
my mom bought me those pants .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re going to have to call her .
sheldon , i am so sorry i dragged you through this .
it &apos;s okay. it wasn &apos;t my first pantsing and it won &apos;t be my last .
and you were right about my motives .
i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny
that might have someday led to sex .
well , you got me out of my pants .
anyway , i &apos;ve learned my lesson .
she &apos;s out of my league , i &apos;m done with her .
got my work , one day i &apos;ll win the nobel prize
and then i &apos;ll die alone .
don &apos;t think like that. you &apos;re not going to die alone .
thank you , sheldon. you &apos;re a good friend .
and you &apos;re certainly not going to win a nobel prize .
this is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest .
they have a great house ale .
cool tiger .
yeah , i &apos;ve had him since level ten .
his name is buttons .
anyway , if you had your own game character
we could hang out , maybe go on a quest .
that sounds interesting .
you &apos;ll think about it ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll be able to stop thinking about it .
smooth .
we &apos;re home .
my god , what happened ?
well , your ex @-@ boyfriend sends his regards
and i think the rest is fairly self @-@ explanatory .
i &apos;m so sorry . i really thought if you guys went instead of me
he wouldn &apos;t be such an ass .
no , it was a valid hypothesis .
that was a valid ... ? what is happening to you ?
really , thank you so much for going and trying , you &apos;re just ...
you &apos;re so terrific. really .
why don &apos;t you put some clothes on ,
i &apos;ll get my purse , and dinner is on me , okay ?
really ? great .
thank you .
you &apos;re not done with her , are you ?
are babies will be smart and beautiful .
not to mention imaginary .
is thai food okay with you , penny ?
sure .
we can &apos;t have thai food ,
we had indian for lunch .
so ?
they &apos;re both curry @-@ based cuisines .
so ?
it would be gastronomically redundant .
i can see we &apos;re going to have to spell out everything for this girl .
any ideas , raj ?
turn left on lake street and head up to colorado .
i know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke .
that sounds like fun .
baby don &apos;t get hook up on me
baby don &apos;t get hook up on me
i don &apos;t know what your odds are in the world as a whole ,
