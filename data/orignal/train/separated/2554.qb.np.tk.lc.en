第二十七季 第十六集
hey , flanders .
gas up your leaf blower much ?
chickens ?
since when do you have chickens ?
oh , about six months .
well , they &apos;ve been driving me crazy .
get rid of them .
don &apos;t let these feathery fellas ruffle your feathers , fella .
chickens .
you have yourself a perfectly good coop ,
and that &apos;s what you keep in it ?
oh , homer , surely you know
there &apos;s nothing tastier than a fresh @-@ laid egg .
how do you want &apos; em , boys ?
coddled ! coddled ! coddled !
what is it about boys and their coddled eggs ?
whoa , so orange .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t eat these .
flanders has freshly @-@ pooped eggs ,
orange as a sunset
over a field of ripe doritos .
while these--
look , i &apos;m just gonna say what we &apos;re all thinking--
store eggs are yellow .
they &apos;re yellow eggs , marge . yellow .
why do you always think about what you don &apos;t have ?
has anyone ever thought about what they do have ?
have you ?
not that much .
have you ?
nope !
have you ?
boy , i won &apos;t live long enough to teach you about sex ,
but i &apos;ll be damned if i don &apos;t show you how to steal eggs .
okay , son , stay sharp in there .
if chickens are known for two things ,
it &apos;s bravery and intelligence .
this is what we &apos;re after .
i got one .
hurry , fat @-@ ass !
how can idiots say there &apos;s no god
when a species that evolved from dinosaurs
feeds us their unfertilized babies ?
ugh , if i could lay eggs like these ,
i &apos;d never leave my bedroom .
the farmer !
homer simpson , i am going to enjoy finding it in my heart
to forgive you for this .
well , there &apos;s no getting past that .
we may not be able to steal flanders &apos; eggs ,
but we can steal his idea .
you mean get our own chickens ,
feed them , love them and eat their eggs ?
check . mate .
urban poultry farming is a great way
to reduce our carbon footprint .
or maybe increase it , i &apos;m not sure .
but they &apos;re so cute !
now , don &apos;t get attached .
i &apos;m about to cut them open to scoop out the eggs .
no , look !
they &apos;re already laying .
now , what lays bacon ?
one ... two ... eggs !
delicious .
delicious .
these don &apos;t taste right .
you &apos;re crazy , these are the best eggs i &apos;ve ever eaten .
no .
no , something is missing .
bart &apos;s right .
they &apos;re not as good as the eggs we stole from flanders .
the eggs ... we stole ... from flanders !
you don &apos;t think they tasted so great
because they were stolen , do you ?
only one way to find out .
my potato chips !
okay , first , a chip from the control bag .
now the stolen bag .
it &apos;s true .
theft equals flavor .
ah , forget it .
just take &apos; em .
you can &apos;t just give them to us !
they only taste good if we steal them !
keep chasing !
it improves the flavor !
sure , sure , whatever works for you .
i guess we don &apos;t need our chickens anymore .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ve already found a research facility
that will raise them humanely .
i wasn &apos;t worried about that .
if you &apos;re going to eat the chickens , don &apos;t tell the girl .
oh , no , these chickens are here to advance the cause of science .
look at all those lab coats .
at exploration incorporated ,
our mission is to help humanity make the next big leap .
that &apos;s so fascinating .
when did you incorporate ?
we are preparing to launch
the first privately @-@ funded , manned mission to mars .
you &apos;re going to mars ?
that &apos;s incredible .
uh , yes .
how do you plan to solve the problem
of eyeball explosion when you take off your space helmet ?
uh , you leave your helmet on .
hmm , these guys seem legit .
this video will explain our revolutionary vision .
human beings are explorers .
it &apos;s what we do .
it &apos;s who we are .
but since our world holds no more secrets ,
we must journey ... to mars .
government agencies like nasa say it will be decades
before we set foot on the red planet .
at exploration incorporated , we &apos;re working hard to establish
a human settlement on mars ten years from today .
soon a select group of colonists
will leave earth forever
and become the first residents of another world .
will you be one of them ?
exploration incorporated .
never stop exploring .
what about those mars nutjobs ?
who wants to take a one @-@ way trip to
a barren , lifeless rock ?
yeah , in a couple years , we &apos;ll have
a perfectly good barren , lifeless rock right here .
this guy gets it .
well , this mission really gives me hope .
i &apos;m tired of nothing but bad news about the future .
yes , but to travel to another planet ,
knowing you can never come back ,
you &apos;d have to be pretty sad .
aniston sad .
i &apos;m not sad , i &apos;m inspired .
that &apos;s why i volunteered this afternoon .
what ? !
the mission leaves in ten years .
i &apos;ll be 18 , and i &apos;m going to mars .
no way , young lady .
we cannot afford to send you to mars .
it &apos;s free .
cheaper than college .
no .
no !
you volunteered to go to mars and leave your family ?
forever ?
this mission could save humanity .
what if i was the first person to set foot on another world ?
i &apos;d never be able to hug my daughter again .
they thought of that .
they give a virtual hug machine to every family back home .
that does look pretty snuggly .
no !
i think this could be my true purpose .
just let me try out .
they might not even pick me .
i mean , i &apos;d pick me , but ...
absolutely not .
you are grounded .
you are confined to this planet .
and its moon .
uh , honey ?
a word before you continue parenting ?
what ?
in all my years of living with the female species ,
i &apos;ve learned one thing .
when they want to do something totally insane ,
your only move is to support them 100 % .
oh , come on , that &apos;s ridiculous .
really ? have you ever done anything
just because someone told you not to ?
you cannot marry homer simpson .
i forbid it .
and now you got me .
oh , my gosh .
we both know lisa &apos;s not going to mars .
it &apos;s just a little girl &apos;s fantasy .
but if you forbid someone from doing something ,
they &apos;ll want to do it more .
so we should just pretend we &apos;re cool
with our daughter abandoning us forever ?
exactly .
it &apos;s an old relationship move i call &quot; turning into the skid . &quot;
if you just play along ,
sooner or later lisa will lose interest in her terrible idea .
you haven &apos;t used that trick on me , have you ?
no , no . i learned it from observing other marriages .
ones less fantastic than ours .
&quot; turning into the skid . &quot;
you know , i looked at a map ,
and mars is just one planet over .
if you really want to try out for this mission , i support you .
really ? thanks , mom !
if they choose me to be a colonist ,
i could make jazz the dominant music form
of a whole new planet .
that &apos;s exactly where jazz belongs .
way to turn into the skid , baby .
now watch lisa lose interest in mars ,
just as sure as you gave up
on opening that g @-@ rated comedy club .
i thought gentle jollies was a great idea .
oh , not great . amazing .
now that i think about it ,
that idea did have a lot of problems .
greetings , candidates .
the testing that begins today will determine
which of you have the necessary skills to thrive on mars .
think of how satisfying it will feel
to stand in the valles marineris
and thunder @-@ chug a blue bronco energy drink .
i &apos;m sorry , blue bronco ?
wait , thunder @-@ chug ?
blue bronco is just one of this mission &apos;s many corporate partners .
because this is a privately funded entrepreneurial mission ,
we &apos;ve teamed up with some of america &apos;s most exciting brands .
we &apos;re talking mega @-@ charge batteries ,
fantasy @-@ lunatics.com ,
trudge @-@ rite work boots ,
draft @-@ pigs .
and who here likes fig glutens ?
what ? the fig seeds get caught in my adult braces .
oh , i should not have given away my dog , man .
oh , god . oh , god . oh , god . oh , god .
oh , it &apos;s hurting my ...
oh ! i can &apos;t feel my ...
principal skinner ?
what brings you on this mission
to make mankind a two @-@ planet species ?
mars is the ultimate field trip .
and all they sell at the gift shop is immortality .
also , i &apos;m drowning in debt .
well , i hope to establish a planet of perfect equality @-@ ment .
on mars , you are my servant .
uh , well , well , either way is good , really .
and then , finally ,
i got to spend some quality time
with the oxygen reclaimers .
you must &apos;ve felt like the belle of the ball .
you said if i supported lisa &apos;s crazy idea ,
she &apos;d lose interest .
oh , marge .
you &apos;ll never understand the female mind .
we &apos;re just getting started .
what more can we do ?
i &apos;ve utilized my male mind to come up with
a plan so supportive ,
lisa will never want to do anything again .
what are you guys doing here ?
we &apos;re trying out for mars , too .
we were so inspired by you being inspired .
a family unit could be perfect for this mission .
nasa would never have the guts
to shoot a baby into space .
and your father is a former astronaut .
what an honor .
last time , i almost killed everybody .
and what did you learn from that ?
lessons , i guess .
okay .
mom , dad and bart
don &apos;t want to go to mars .
so this must be some sort of
mind @-@ game reverse super @-@ fake @-@ out .
poor lisa .
she is so faked out .
and all i have to do is be patient .
pretty soon , they &apos;ll get sick of this and quit .
i &apos;m getting sick of this .
i think i &apos;ll quit soon .
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
i wonder which one of these two guys is the one i quit to ?
we will now test your ability
to handle close confinement .
for the next week ,
you &apos;ll be living in the martian habitat simulator .
i &apos;ll man this station .
okay , mom .
since you &apos;re so excited to go to mars ,
you &apos;ll be thrilled to start on
the hab &apos;s daily maintenance procedures .
&quot; nutrition zone sterilization sequence . &quot;
that &apos;s just kitchen cleanup .
fun !
no , no , no .
procedures aren &apos;t &quot; fun . &quot;
sure , if you call them &quot; procedures , &quot; they &apos;re a bore ,
but if you think of them as &quot; chores , &quot;
they can be a blast !
they &apos;re not chores !
they &apos;re science !
ooh , there &apos;s even directions
on how to properly clean this binder .
oh , no .
you cannot like this more than me .
dinner is served !
i rehydrated it with love .
and recycled toilet water .
so good , marge !
well , today i tested nitrogen levels in our atmosphere .
they were the same as yesterday .
more toilet carrots , please !
can &apos;t sleep .
my sleeping pod &apos;s too small .
they have an expansion mode
for morbidly obese astronauts .
i know we &apos;re just here to fake @-@ support our daughter ,
but you &apos;re pretty good at this space junk .
moms spend their whole lives
obsessing over unlikely catastrophes .
in space , that &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to do .
食人主义 氰化物泄露
the hab study is complete .
to all the male participants ,
your monumental incompetence
has sullied and cheapened space forever .
now get out .
good . it &apos;s a stupid idea
and i hope everyone dies .
you &apos;re letting the martians in !
i &apos;m keeping the jumpsuit .
marge and lisa , congratulations .
you &apos;ve both passed with flying colors
and will be named finalists in our astronaut search .
marge , you &apos;re a revelation .
most of our candidates are of the egghead loner variety .
bookworms , teacher &apos;s pets ,
friendless middle children , that sort of thing .
but you display an amazing ability
to perform repetitive tasks without getting bored .
even our robotic arm gets a little cranky .
that &apos;s two , lorraine !
may i talk to you in private , please ?
admit it , the only reason you &apos;re here is to support me
until i lose interest and quit .
well , i &apos;m not going anywhere ,
so you can quit .
maybe i don &apos;t want to quit .
do you realize what a big deal it is to be a space colonist ?
yes !
that &apos;s why i want to do it !
i think you don &apos;t like that i &apos;m just as good at mars as you .
maybe even better .
ha ! hardly .
all you are is a ...
a stay @-@ at @-@ hab space wife !
well , it looks like the ego has landed .
you &apos;re the last person i would ever want to go to mars with .
in ten years .
that &apos;s too bad ,
because i &apos;m going with you
in ten years .
on mars , that would be a door slam !
sometimes i feel like lisa has no respect for me .
i know , i know .
i &apos;m finally good at something
and she has to make it into a competition .
that must be really hard for you .
it is .
i &apos;m so sorry you have to go through this .
thank you .
mom &apos;s always trying to hold me back !
i know , i know .
i can &apos;t be her little girl forever .
that must be really hard for you .
it is !
i &apos;m so sorry you have to go through this .
thank you .
that listening @-@ to @-@ women junk
you taught me really works .
the trick is in the nodding .
dad , after seeing mom and lisa go at it ,
i &apos;m glad our relationship is about physical abuse ,
not psychological .
me , too , boy .
this press conference was originally scheduled
to introduce our ten mars mission finalists .
however , our rivals at space colony one ,
a division of pepperidge farms ,
just announced that their mars rocket is nearing completion .
we made a solemn promise to fig glutens
that they would be the first cookie on mars .
therefore ,
we have moved up our launch date from 2026 to ...
thursday .
thursday ?
this thursday ?
are you all ready to be a part of history ?
i wanted to be someone
who &apos;s bravely going to mars eventually .
i haven &apos;t used my open table dining points !
i &apos;m still very much an alcoholic .
uh , i @-@ i guess we should leave , too .
i knew it !
what ?
this has all been an elaborate charade .
you never had the guts to go to mars .
oh , i have the guts .
i once went to a rock concert by myself in the rain .
it was loverboy .
then let &apos;s go . to mars .
yeah , let &apos;s go !
to mars .
ladies and gentlemen ,
mankind &apos;s first residents of mars ,
powered by simmer @-@ time dinner sauces .
dinner time is simmer @-@ time . for sauce .
they &apos;re leaving in a week ?
mom &apos;s my only good parent .
and lisa &apos;s my only good kid !
why won &apos;t they admit
that neither of them actually wants to go to mars ?
i &apos;m not giving up yet .
there &apos;s got to be a limit to their stubbornness , right ?
t @-@ minus one minute to launch .
here we go ! i guess .
yep .
we &apos;re doing this , apparently .
i &apos;m sorry i doubted you , mom .
there &apos;s no one i would rather go to mars with .
i love you , sweetie .
i love you , too .
i don &apos;t want to go !
this is the stupidest idea we ever had !
abort launch !
that &apos;s a negative .
i think you &apos;re forgetting the model of blue bronco
&quot; let &apos;s do this thing . &quot;
twelve ...
eleven ...
this is not happening .
do you know how to run the dishwasher ?
of course not !
maybe we can use paper plates !
where the hell do we get those ?
mom , no !
marge , no !
... three ...
two ... one ...
ignition !
it &apos;s not a real rocket .
it &apos;s the outside of a real rocket .
we did plan to build a real rocket .
and that &apos;s one thing they can never take away from us .
that plan is our legacy .
then why did you move up the launch if you knew it was fake ?
to inspire the next generation .
and to provide a distraction while we drove away .
then why are you still here ?
our car wouldn &apos;t start .
mom , doesn &apos;t it frighten you
that we almost went to mars out of sheer stubbornness ?
that &apos;s what a mother @-@ daughter relationship is , sweetie .
a series of near @-@ fatal emotional standoffs .
okay , but it doesn &apos;t have to be that way .
surely we can learn from this .
one day , we &apos;ll figure it out .
on this planet or another .
it &apos;s my life !
if i want to leave mars
and move to venus , you can &apos;t stop me !
mom &apos;s always trying to hold me back .
i know , i know .
i can &apos;t be her little girl forever .
that must be really hard for you .
it is .
nod @-@ bot is so sorry you have to go through this .
thank you .
well , that &apos;s one for the win column .
i can &apos;t wait to find out what we &apos;re gonna do next .
we should fix racism .
racism is bad for business .
and that is racism &apos;s fatal flaw .
i &apos;m thinking of an app
that would use the best algorithms in the world .
algorithms like that would be great
for this idea i &apos;ve been back @-@ burnering .
it &apos;s an ad @-@ supported restaurant .
you get free food , but you have to watch ads .
if you want a hamburger , you watch five ads .
tater tots are , like , three ads .
have you tried these things ?
i &apos;ve heard about them , actually .
they &apos;re good .
i didn &apos;t actually ...
they &apos;re really good .
i love everything you just said ,
but what if it was a barbershop ?
might be a good idea ...
if you &apos;re interested in changing the world !
