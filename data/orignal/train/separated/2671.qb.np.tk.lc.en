what else did comley say ?
nothing much .
there was stuff missing from the truck ...

then he said to tell tony thanks ,
and if tony needs anything , to call .
tony ?
those junkie fucks work for tony .
they hijack comley &apos;s truck , i get it back ,
and he thanks tony ?
well , i think you should &apos;ve taken care of this christopher moltisanti thing ...

i bought his kid a $ 400 surfboard for his birthday .
mr. soprano ?

it &apos;s depressing and scary to you ?
not to me .
but it &apos;s got that built right into it .
how are things ?
good .
i had a real good week .
a friend &apos;s in the hospital .
that &apos;s never pleasant , but ....
otherwise , i &apos;m having a good week .

owns property . owns the motel down the street from the club .
the jew with the black clothes and the curls .
they &apos;re called hasidim .
&quot; hasidim &quot; but i don &apos;t believe them .
what does teittleman want ?
a divorce for his daughter .
what do you mean ?
his son @-@ in @-@ law will not give his daughter the consent ...
... unless teittleman gives him 50 percent of his motel .
they call it a get .
why don &apos;t he just ... ?
it &apos;s taboo for their religion .
you know about this shit ?
run . trust me . you don &apos;t want to do business with these people .
he said there &apos;s 25 large in it if we can get him this get .
there &apos;s a saying amongst jews
&quot; when a jew gets a divorce , even the altar sheds tears . &quot;
all right , i heard enough .
look , i &apos;m getting kind of tired .
let &apos;s go get a cup of coffee .

the place looks good .
it needs a little work , but we &apos;ll get there .
you need some cash until the insurance on the restaurant comes ....

i thought that was settled .

they think you &apos;re mobbed up ? you &apos;re a working stiff .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense . who would burn down a perfectly good restaurant ?

the goon squads who smacked these husbands around to get the divorce ...
... were put out of business by the d.a.
all right , 25 percent .
he wants 50 , we get 25 .
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m not talking to you .
you get me what i want , mr. soprano , and you have a deal .

poor charmaine . i tried to find nice things to say about that house .
ain &apos;t that bad . just needs a little work , that &apos;s all .
those two are so broke . and that fire .

matt , i &apos;m serious , you guys .
if we can &apos;t score some crystal , we &apos;re dead .
with this budget , we can do three waiters for the hors d &apos;oeuvres ...
... two for the champagne .
it &apos;s such a load off . this party has me at sixes and sevens .
pediatric hospital &apos;s such a worthy cause .
oona !
there &apos;s fingerprints on the breakfront . i want this place to sparkle .
she &apos;s usually very good . from poland .
please get in the car , sir .
like the cop would be calling him &quot; sir &quot; if the cameras weren &apos;t around .

she won &apos;t go there . she just wants me to give her some speed .
isn &apos;t it better if she gets it from you with all that poison around ?
kids . you think you can protect them .
but you can &apos;t .
as the rainy season approaches , chicks alter their eating habits .
are you watching that nature shit again ?
what are you doing here ?
my kid stepped on a nail . i had to get him a shot .
yeah , where is he ?
at the er with carmela .
so whatever happened with the jew at the motel ?
they reached out to him , he wasn &apos;t receptive .
they &apos;re going back .

just looking for my nurse &apos;s pen .
you got the wrong room because you are not my nurse .
i know , but i made up the bed .
no , sweetheart . i have not been out of this bed all day .

she &apos;s a friend of mine from the club . nice girl .
i joined them later on . we got a little booze .
you were nice to have a party for your friend .
&quot; tufts medical school . &quot;
you &apos;re a doctor .
what do you think ? about jackie ?
i &apos;d have to know more about his condition .
i told you about his condition . he &apos;s got cancer .
what kind of cancer ?
it &apos;s in the intestines .
there was a tumor and they took it out .
and it &apos;s recurred .
but you said he might go home . they &apos;re not operating ?
it &apos;s next to something vital .
i see .
you see ?
from what you &apos;re saying , it doesn &apos;t sound good .
from what i &apos;m telling you ?
what do i know ? i &apos;m not a doctor .
you &apos;re angry . who with ?
i &apos;ll tell you .
this man has had chemo every day for three weeks .
he still has every last hair on his head .
every last hair on his head , and he &apos;s got a beautiful head of hair .
so don &apos;t tell me how it sounds .
you don &apos;t know him or me ...
... or what you &apos;re talking about .
we &apos;re getting closer to you confronting your true feelings ...
... about what &apos;s really going on .
wait a minute . i just told you my true feelings .
you tell me what &apos;s really going on .
the tree in the painting rotted out , you said .
nothing indicates that .
i knew that was a fucking scam .
i knew that painting was a fucking scam !
you remember your dream ? the ducks ?
it took on another meaning .
what happens to a tree that &apos;s rotted out ?
trees , ducks . what are you , ranger rick ?
some job you shrinks got . you think everybody &apos;s lying ...
... while you &apos;re pulling scams on them ! fuck you !
there &apos;s 37 definites . we got another 13 maybes ...
... plus the whole pediatric hospital board .
right .
are you sure we ordered enough champagne ?
right .
gene says they shouldn &apos;t be too sober for the auction .
if anyone ever finds out you got this from me
look at me . this is no joke .
we don &apos;t always get along , but you don &apos;t want to see me dead .
i gotta call hunter . you &apos;re the best .
hey , i &apos;m serious . just this once , okay ? i &apos;m no drug dealer .
i don &apos;t want to see you get poisoned . your father ever finds out ...
god , doesn &apos;t anyone ever knock ?
tell brendan that hunter would rather die than go out with him .
brendan ?
christopher , keep that asshole away from that child .
he asked me to do him a favor , i did it .
all right , you delivered the message . now let meadow study .
two goombahs from the old neighborhood .
what , they think they &apos;re gonna name it the soprano wing in the new hospital ?
i think you &apos;re just jealous of their money .
me ?
yeah .
okay , but explain to me this .
he offers us two tickets to the caribbean out of friendship .
you say no , they &apos;re tainted .
but for some party , i take his money to clean his toilets .
first of all , arthur , this is a paying job and not some cruise .
and why do you always have to exaggerate ?
you &apos;re not cleaning his toilets . you &apos;re a chef .
good . so you don &apos;t mind that he fronts me money for a new place ...
... because he offered .
look at that face .
oh , god , don &apos;t tell me that you took money from tony soprano .
how is it different ? i &apos;m a chef . i need a place to cook .
how ? i &apos;m giving carmela my support , that &apos;s how .
and it &apos;s for a very reputable cause .
but to have that man as a partner , trust me , that would be insane .
it &apos;d mean the end of everything .
at least he made the gesture .
name me another person who offered us anything except the sopranos ?
watch what you &apos;re doing . you &apos;re squeezing the quail .
should we turn on the air ?
it &apos;s going okay . do you like the food ?
i was so busy schmoozing , i barely had a bite .
don &apos;t miss those little veal tonnatos .
charmaine !
not in the car ! please ! not in the car !
shut up ! shut up !
shut up and get in the fucking car !
i can &apos;t get used to strangers in my house .
why &apos;d you invite them ?
try one of these .
you &apos;re a fucking great cook .
i cook like this ...
... it reminds me of what i lost .
to have my restaurant ripped from me . i can &apos;t tell you ....
it was like losing a limb .
sometimes i lay in bed ...
enough already .
forget about the past . look to the future .
i &apos;m sick of hearing of your restaurant . shut up , you depressing jerk !
what the fuck do you know about it ?
you motherfucker .
you fucking jerk !
come on . give it up .
see what you get when you ...
fucking son of a bitch !
get up , you stubborn fuck .
please !
too late . all this because you won &apos;t say yes to a divorce ?
it &apos;s not that simple !
why not ? you sign your fucking name to a piece of paper !
i don &apos;t like you .
well , i don &apos;t like you . you believe this prick ?
what do i get , huh ? you work for nothing ? i don &apos;t think so !
i say we force @-@ feed him his sombrero .
she wants to go to israel , i send her . i pay .
i feed her , i clothe her ,
i put a roof over her head .
i worked for her father for 20 years
and took his abuse .
so i get nothing ?
stand up !
we don &apos;t care .
tough fucking luck , ain &apos;t it , pal ?
you mother !
silvio !
motherfucker .
this guy &apos;s a bull .
paulie , if we don &apos;t kill this prick ...
... we should put him to work .
time &apos;s a @-@ wasting .
i was lucky i could get out at all with that party tonight .
shit !
hello .
tony .
sorry to bother you . this isn &apos;t working out how we hoped .
with our friend with the funny sideburns .
don &apos;t say no more on the phone .
i &apos;m coming down .
shit !
i gotta go .
you just got here .
yeah , i know , but i gotta go .
what &apos;s that painting mean to you ?
nothing . it just reminds me of david hockey .
you want something to munch on ?
are you kidding me ?
most guys i know would be happy to get rid of their wife .
i tried explaining the realities here .
this guy &apos;s as stubborn as a fucking mule .
he says it &apos;s principle .
i think we gotta ... you know . that &apos;s why we called you .
i promised the father @-@ in @-@ law i wouldn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know what else to do .
you &apos;re a stupid fucker , you know that ?
i &apos;ve heard it said .
what are you , proud of it ?
you kill me and a dark cloud goes over shlomo &apos;s house .
either way , they &apos;ll be no get unless restitution is made .
you really would let me kill you , you sick fuck .
you ever heard of the masada ?
for two years , 900 jews held their own ...
... against 15,000 roman soldiers .
they chose death before enslavement .
and the romans , where are they now ?
you &apos;re looking at them , asshole .
yea , though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ...
... i fear no evil for thou art with me .
yeah , hold that thought .
yeah .
hesh .
i &apos;m with my non @-@ shellfish @-@ eating friend , and i &apos;m tapped out .
this guy won &apos;t listen to reason .
didn &apos;t i tell you , huh ?
i warned you to keep away from them .
he left me no options .
he &apos;s willing to go down with the ship .
here &apos;s a thought .
maybe he &apos;s willing to go to the world to come ...
... but if he &apos;s stuck here on this earth ...
... i know one thing that no man wants to go through life without .
what ?
that &apos;s a brilliant idea .
make like a mohel , huh ?
finish his bris .
yeah .
paulie , get the ball cutters from out of the truck .
ariel , we &apos;re going to plan b.
the phone has been ringing all morning .
the rotellis , the trillos . he has to do with computers .
they &apos;re wonderful . she invited us to brunch .
really ?
yep .
but it was the food , mainie . everybody raved about it .
cynthia said , &quot; i love those rice balls , &quot; like she never had arancini before .
really , mainie , i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
it meant so much to me , having you here .
it just made it so much fun for me .
mainie , is something wrong ? you got something on your mind ?
what could be wrong ?
listen , sweetie .
it may not seem like it right now , but you &apos;ll get back on your feet again .
carmela , i &apos;m fine where i am .
i know . that &apos;s not what i meant .
carmela , i never wanted to tell you this .
it happened so long ago . you and tony weren &apos;t even married .
it &apos;s probably silly for me to even bring it up now .
what ?
you were at the shore with your parents .
you and tony were on the outs . he called me .
he did ?
one thing led to another , we started dating each other and ....
carmela , i slept with him .
you slept with tony ?
really , it wasn &apos;t for me .
carmela , what i &apos;m trying to say is , stop worrying about me .
really . i mean , we both made our choices . i &apos;m fine with mine .
i &apos;d like for you to consider this .
don &apos;t give me that .
what &apos;s going on ? why &apos;d you page me ?
this guy &apos;s trying to pull some bullshit .
hey , zz top . the guy gave you the get , didn &apos;t he ?
but not because of you . you threatened him with castration .
it was business that brought him around .
he wanted 50 % , you wanted 25 % .
so i split the difference . i gave him 15 percent ...
... he gives my daughter the divorce ....
it &apos;s business . it worked out .
you gotta walk with me , shlomo .
listen , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m taking good care of you here .
what &apos;s that ?
for your considerable trouble . as the talmud says ...
i don &apos;t give a shit what he says , okay ?
you want to give your son @-@ in @-@ law 15 percent of the motel ?
you go ahead . it comes out of your end .
now , we got you your get . you get us our 25 percent . got it ?
my son was right .
you &apos;re mud . godless clay !
i created a living golem !
what the fuck is a golem ?
it &apos;s a monster ! frankenstein !
get out of here ...
living dead !
... before i take your asshole son and shove him up your ass !
shut up !
hey , how you doing ?
one second .
i got some good news . we &apos;re in the motel business . how do you like that ?
read this .
102.7 .
they should take my temperature with the other machine .
paulie broke his hand on the guy &apos;s head .
digital .
we &apos;re waling on this guy .
i &apos;m gonna cut his dick off .
i &apos;ll call the nurse .
he &apos;s mumbling and praying . i &apos;m getting his pants off .
they should take my temperature again .
yeah , yeah , call them .
poor jackie .
god has his reasons .
livia , he looked twice as old as me .
so what &apos;s really on your mind , corrado ?
this christopher moltisanti .
christopher ? what about him ?
him and his little friend .
they &apos;re slapping me in the face , and they &apos;re hiding behind tony .
well , tony always loved christopher like a son .
and so do i , junior .
he put up my storm windows for me one year .
good .
but what do i do ?
i just let him and this filone kid piss on me in public ?
and how far do i go before i light a frigging match ...
... under that hotheaded son of yours ?
maybe christopher could use a little talking to .
you know .
the other one ...
... filone ?
i don &apos;t know .
you got a lot of sense for an old gal .
no , i &apos;m a babbling idiot .
that &apos;s why my son put me in a nursing home .
he didn &apos;t even care i was there .
it was just him and that fucking cancer .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s already gone .
yes .
somebody called me a frankenstein today .
really ?
this hasid i &apos;m doing business with . these hasids , i mean , they &apos;re out there ...
... but they got their beliefs , you know ?
they &apos;re not afraid of death . this one guy wasn &apos;t .
maybe they have the belief because they are afraid .
i &apos;m not afraid of death .
not if it &apos;s for something .
you know ? a war , something like that .
a reason .
but jackie ....
to see this strong ...
... beautiful man ...
... just wither away to nothing ....

you can &apos;t fight it .
you envy the hasids and their beliefs ?
all this shit &apos;s for nothing ?
if it &apos;s for nothing , why must i think about it ?
that &apos;s the mystery , isn &apos;t it ?
the mystery of god , or whatever you want to call it ...

... of knowing that we &apos;re gonna die .
do you feel like frankenstein ?
a thing ?
lacking humanity ?
lacking human feelings ?
thank you . that &apos;s for you .
say hello to freddy , all right ?
let me go !
