So you can go on the tour.
But I want to go to Idyllwild.
Classical music has been everything.
What kind of idiot breaks into somebody's house
in the middle of the night?
I snuck out so I could see Jude, all right?!
What does that mean?
We had some girls come into our tent.
We ended up making out with them.
And you don't have to worry about
me and Connor hanging out.
Because his dad said we're not allowed to be friends anymore, OK.
It wasn't an accident.
Why... would you...?
Sometimes I just wanna die.
As soon as you're emancipated we can adopt you right away.
And you do need to keep this from Robert,
which we don't feel good about.
I'm Ana's daughter.
We didn't even know that you existed until it was too late.
You were already adopted.
I met our grandparents.
You did?
I tried to get them to take Ana's baby.
You're decided, 100 percent?
Once I give her to Stef and Lena,
she's gonna grow up in a wonderful home
with her brother and sister.
Remember we decided not to tell the kids about the baby?
Well, we might want to get on that.
Is she gonna be here the whole time?
Like, when is she having this baby?
We're really not quite sure, sweetheart.
Well, when is she due?
Six weeks.
I'm supposed to give up my room for six weeks?
Hi, Ana, um... can I get you some coffee?
Are you still drinking coffee?
Um, tea?
Yeah, we can do that.
You can sit there. Jude's still asleep.
I don't wanna put Brandon out.
Oh, no, it's fine, really. Not a big deal.
Uh, Ana can I get you something to eat, some eggs... maybe?
Oh, thank you. The smell makes me a little...
Sick? I remember that.
Oh, Mama, did we hear anything from St. Tristan's yet?
Are they gonna loan us their auditorium for the dance-off Monday?
Yes, they are.
Excellent!
Oh, there are two dance teams for the school
but only one can represent at States.
So we're doing a dance-off so the students can decide.
Oh, that sounds exciting.
And stressful.
It's become, like, a thing,
and now the whole student body wants to come.
Oh, please, you love it.
Shut up.
Hey, language, please.
When you were little, anytime I'd put music on,
you'd wear one of my old t-shirts
like a dress and you'd dance all around.
And, of course, we had to watch you or you'd get so mad.
Really? I don't remember that.
I do. And some things never change.
So, Jesus, I spoke with the recruiter from Flintwood.
He's going to come and sit down with us tonight.
Really?
Oh, Jesus might go to boarding school.
Yes, might.
Don't get yourself all worked up. We're just gonna hear him out.
OK.
Callie, can I make you some toast?
Or something else to eat?
No, I'm OK.
I gotta get ready. Robert'll be here soon.
I'm gonna finish getting ready for work.
I'm really excited about the baby.
Well, I'm just really glad your moms decided to take her.
Hey, Callie? I know this is hard.
I'm OK.
OK.
Hopefully we'll get you emancipated before you
have to spend another weekend with the Quinns.
But, until then, just please remember
that you can't say anything.
I know.
OK.
I hate how ugly this has gotten.
I know. You don't approve.
But I'm just trying to keep Callie under this roof.
What's gonna happen if Ana's parents decide
they wanna take this baby?
What's going on?
I went back to see our grandparents.
Why?
She asked them to take this baby.
Moms want it.
OK, yeah, I know that moms want the baby. Now.
I think you should just tell moms, OK.
In case they try to fight them for it or something.
OK, It's a her. And they're not going to.
They're gonna be relieved. Because they're old.
They don't want to have to raise a child if they don't have to.
Trust me. I've got this.
It's just a casual lunch with my dad and his wife.
They want to meet you.
Hi.
Oh, my God. Sophia!
You told her.
Uh, yeah, sorry.
It's OK.
I guess you've probably had enough surprises from me.
Too soon?
Maybe a little.
Ok...
How are you?
Good. Really.
And happy to be home.
Look, I'm wearing your...
Oh, yeah. They look really nice.
I love them. Thank you.
Yeah, no, of course.
I'm really glad to see you.
Yeah, I'm really glad to see you, too.
Come here.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Connor Stevens's room?
And you are...?
His cousin.
Uh, 325. Down the hall.
What are you doing here?
I told your mom I don't want you hanging around Connor.
I know.
I wanna see him. I wanna see my friend.
And I'm not leaving until I do.
She'll grow up in a great, big family with,
like, the two best moms in the world.
And I know Ana tried really hard to keep you apart from us,
but I know my moms'll want you to know the baby,
and us, if you want.
Right?
What? Yeah, sure, OK.
And Ana's staying with us, until the baby's born
so you don't have to worry about her.
I mean, if you were.
So everything's gonna work out fine.
Of course.
Who makes those?
Oh, I do.
It's a family tradition, one for every child and grandchild.
Wow. There's a lot of 'em...
You think, maybe one day, we could meet them?
I think that could probably be arrang.
Well, we should probably get home,
but thank you for the bunuelos, they were delicious.
Adios.
OK, bye.
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you.
They're good kids. Their moms are doing a good job.
But are you really OK with that family
raising another one of our grandchildren?
They call it a personality disorder,
which makes me laugh 'cause I feel like it sounds like
I think I'm the Queen of England or something,
which it's totally not.
I mean, it's a chemical imbalance, an illness,
it's not something that I have to be...
be ashamed of, right?
Right. It just made me feel so hopeless.
Like I was never gonna be normal.
I know what it's like to feel hopeless, so...
I'm sorry.
So, where is my favorite girl?
Papa!
Oh, sweetie, oh. It is so go to see you back home.
Let me look at you.
Pretty as a picture.
Dad. This is Callie.
Callie, this is my father, Robert Senior.
Callie. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Wow, it's true,
you two are the spitting image of each other!
My goodness!
This is my wife.
Monica.
If we just pull a little from here and slide it there
we should be able to cover the expenses we're red-lining until,
fingers crossed, we get the Kilfer grant.
When do you think we'll hear?
Any day now, I think.
You OK? You look a little stressed.
I mean, as stressed, as someone as beautiful as you can look.
That's very kind of you.
Stef moved Ana into the house.
Stef did? By herself?
I guess she was living somewhere really terrible,
and, so, Stef packed her up and moved her home.
Without talking to you?
Yeah, well, she's been doing a lot of that lately.
I'm sorry. My ex was a bit of a one man band.
I didn't get much of a say in anything.
Finally, I just had to leave him.
Not that our situations are the same.
We just weren't right for each other.
Yeah, sometimes I think that's why I lost the baby.
Because I knew we weren't gonna make it.
Well, a newborn can test the best of marriages.
You have to be in a good place.
Oh. It's Connor's dad.
Hello?
That's a beautiful piece, B.
What's it, Chopin?
Brahms? What?
Uh, well, first off, it's a contemporary piece.
and... I composed it.
Get out. Are you sure you're my son?
I don't know, I just figured if Idyllwild sees I can compose,
they might cut me some slack on the playing.
You gotta get outta your head.
You're gonna blow 'em away.
Hey, what should I have for the lady from Idyllwild on Monday?
I mean, coffee, tea? Something to snack on?
I think anything's fine.
Thanks for letting me do it here.
I didn't want her coming to the house.
You still haven't told your mom yet, huh?
No, I just don't want everyone finding out if I don't get in...
So you can still go on tour?
No. No, Lou's... we're done.
There's not gonna be any tour. For me, anyway.
I just hope I didn't blow it all for nothing.
Look, B, you wanna play dive bars,
I'll be at every gig.
But this is special, B.
This is your gift. It's not nothin'.
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee,
and when I come back, he needs to be gone,
otherwise I'm gonna call security.
I know how hard this must be for you, honey, I do.
Losing a friend is one of the most painful things to go through.
Mr. Stevens made it very clear...
He's not my friend.
Connor's not your friend?
There were no girls.
In the tent. On the camping trip.
It was just us. We kissed.
And now we're kinda like...
More than friends?
Connor... he told his dad...
Whatcha doin'?
I'm putting these programmable lights on our dance costumes. See?
What does that mean? Programmable?
Oh, Emma and I are writing code
so the lights change in time to the choreography.
Writing code?
It's how you tell computers what to do.
You're so smart. I never even finished high school.
Why? Why'd you drop out? What happened?
I fell in with the wrong crowd, I guess. We got into drugs.
You know, for most of my friends, it was just fun,
but for me, once I got started,
once I knew I could shut down all my feelings,
there was no going back.
Why did you want to shut down your feelings?
I don't know. My mother was really strict with me.
I was the only girl
with three older brothers who could do no wrong.
And I just felt like my mother
gave them everything they wanted and, me, not so much.
So I rebelled, you know?
I mean, I know now, she was hard on me
because she thought she had to be.
It's really hard being a girl in this world.
I'm really glad you've been raised by two strong, independent women.
I hope you know you can do anything
if you set your mind to it.
What?
The baby's kicking... hard.
You want to feel?
That's so cool.
It's like you've got a little alien in there.
That's nothing. Think how it felt with two aliens in there.
Oh, Emma's here to help.
Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!
Jesus!
Not too fast.
Yeah, slow down.
Let's get her onto the couch.
Can you walk on it?
I don't know.
Be careful.
How many times have moms told you
not to leave your skateboard in the house?!
Get her leg up.
Oh, my God, without six dancers,
we're gonna have to forfeit.
Oh, no. I'm not letting Kaitlyn win.
What're you gonna do? Pull a dancer outta thin air?
Are you gonna get that?
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Jesus. Sorry to stop by unannounced...
Is Ana in?
Um, yeah. Come in.
Sophia, your father tells me you're getting rid of Quincy?
What's that about?
Uh, Sophia just has so many activities now.
She loves to ride.
What about all those ribbons and the medals that you won?
I'm sorry Papa, I know you gave him to me,
but I just feel bad
cause I don't ride him as much as I used to.
He's going to a charity
where kids want to learn ride.
He's gonna get a lot of love and attention.
Yeah.
I think that's great.
Kids' interests change, Robert, as they grow up.
Thank goodness,
or I'd be sitting here in a macrame dress.
Well, I just think it's interesting, the timing of all these changes.
Dad...
I'm just saying, I don't think it's a coincidence.
And, Callie, I mean you no offense.
I'm sure you're a lovely young lady.
But imagine how Sophia must feel.
Now you have another daughter,
you're totally obsessed with.
I'm not obsessed.
You're trying to get custody, aren't you?
As if Sophia wasn't enough.
This has nothing to do with how much we love Sophia.
It's OK, Papa. I love having a sister.
Sweetheart you tried to kill yourself.
Dad, enough. I love both my daughters.
I wouldn't even be in this position if you hadn't forced me
to choose between her mother and this family.
Oh, here we go,
we all know how I've ruined you life.
That's not what I said.
I love my wife. And God knows I've put you through so much.
I don't deserve you.
You didn't ruin my life, Dad.
But do you have any idea how hard Callie's has been?
All the hell she's been through because I wasn't there for her?
That's not my fault.
No, it's not. It's mine.
Because I didn't stand up to you.
Is that what all this is about?
You finally standing up to me.
By forcing a young lady
to come live with you, against her will?
I'm not forcing...
You can't turn back time, Robert.
You've got regrets, well, son, so do we all.
This young lady is happy where she is.
So why are you putting her through more hell?
You can't keep them apart forever, Adam.
What about school?
I'm pulling him from Anchor Beach.
With just a few weeks left in the school year?
He'll have to repeat the grade.
And then what? You lock him up until he's 18?
Look... you can keep Jude outside the door as long as you want,
as long as you're willing to stand watch.
But what then? You gonna keep all the boys outside the door?
Or you could try. But trust me, if you do,
you'll be the one who ends up getting shut out.
I don't care that your son's gay.
I just don't want mine to be.
What's this?
War paint.
I thought that if my moms didn't take the baby,
maybe they would.
I'm sorry, I should have told you.
So, is that why you're here?
You wanna take my baby?
No.
We're here...
because we want you to keep your baby.
We want to help you.
Any way you want.
You can come and stay with us, or... maybe...
You should be with your family, Ana.
So should your child.
I can't.
It's too late.
Stef and Lena are taking her.
I can't... I'm sorry...
no.
Wow, is it hard to get my dad's wife to leave a party.
I'm really sorry about what my dad said earlier.
It's OK.
No, it's... it's not.
I thought he'd be on his best behavior, especially today.
He adores Sophia.
That's obvious.
No, it's fine, honest,
families are weird.
All of them.
I guess you really don't wanna be a part of this one now, huh?
But I am... part of you and Sophia.
I don't wanna fight that anymore.
And for the record, I'm mad at my mom.
That she lied to both of us.
Yeah, well, she was just doing what she thought was best for you.
Yeah, but it wasn't.
I'm just sayin'...
You aren't the only one that made mistakes,
so don't blame yourself.
If you knew about me, you woulda taken care of me.
And Jude. I know that.
And it's not that I don't love you. I do.
It's just the Fosters, they're home, and they feel like home.
No matter what, just know
that I want you to be a part of my life.
To be my dad.
Whatever happens, you can trust me, just know that... honest.
I know. I do.
Oh, Robert, sorry. Um, you have a call.
It's your lawyer.
Oh, well, that was quite an afternoon, wasn't it?
I just hope you know that everything that Robert does,
he does out of love for you.
I do. I do know that.
You're trying to get emancipated?
Well, hope to see you in the fall, young man.
See ya.
Thank you.
So, can I go?
Let us talk about it, but...
But he was very persuasive.
Yes!
Go do your homework.
How can we say no?
What are you doing home, love?
Is everything OK?
Robert found out about the emancipation.
OK, what did he say?
Nothing. He just brought me home.
This is exactly what I was afraid of.
What do you think he's gonna do?
There's nothing he can do.
It's gonna be OK. Go inside. We'll be right in.
Nothing he can do?
Didn't want to scare her.
She's already...
Shh, please.
She's already scared.
If Robert goes to the judge with this,
there's no question who's gonna get custody of Callie.
It's...
Come in.
Just wondered if you needed anything?
No, I'm good, thank you.
Ok.
Jesus.
Are you serious about going to this boarding school?
I think so. Why?
I don't know, I just...
...you have such a wonderful family and home.
And I just wish I hadn't left mine when I was 15. That's all.
Sorry.
That's OK. Well, night.
Good night.
What're you doing?
Oh, Callie's home
and we have to pull an all-nighter.
Can I talk to you?
I'll be downstairs.
I think Ana wants to keep the baby.
But I think the only reason she isn't is because of you.
What am I supposed to do?
Tell her it's OK.
And what about our moms?
They'll understand.
They're doing this for you. Everyone is.
You know what, I can't deal with this right now.
Thanks to you, I've got one day
to pull this dance-off outta my ass.
You can barely walk. You're not gonna be able to dance.
Oh, we'll see about that.
I like it. It's subtle.
Got a minute?
Uh, no, not really, but good to know you're alive.
Sorry. I was sulking.
OK. But I really do have somewhere to be.
I got a call from this A&R guy a friend knows,
负责发掘 训练歌手或艺人
he's at Legit label.
He heard that demo we sent out to the clubs,
and he wants to come to one of our LA gigs.
He really likes the sound.
It's kind of a big deal.
So...
you know, you can go to this program for a summer
and have fun or whatever...
Or you could come on tour, who knows what could happen.
We're good together.
I love you.
Come on tour with me.
He, uh... He had to loan the car to his moms.
One of them.
I offered to pick him up but he...
Why don't we just try him again?
Oh, hey. I was just about to leave for St. Tristan's.
We can drive together
if you don't mind riding in my son's beat-up Volvo.
My car's in the shop.
I, uh, heard from the Kilfer Foundation...
We got the grant!
Oh, my God!
I'm so excited.
So the last count of eight is:
chug, chug, down, out,
cross and up...
Now that's a move I haven't seen before.
Looks like the rumors are true.
I just wanted to say, break a leg.
Oops, looks like you already did.
Everything's set in the back.
I hope to hell you can pull this off.
Because if she wins there is no God.
Careful, we don't wanna show up drunk.
Yeah, that would be quite the scandal.
What?
Ana's gonna be there.
Mariana invited her.
How do you feel about that?
Fine...
Fine?
Really?
No. No, not fine.
Um... nothing's fine right now.
Tell me.
I just feel really awful saying this.
I'm just not excited about this baby.
Not like I was about Frankie, you know.
I mean, I know I'm going to love her, but right now,
all I feel is overwhelmed...
...and worried. About everything.
Including my marriage.
Oh, it's OK.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
I should... go.
Uh, yeah. I'll see you there...
Mama better get here soon.
Have you heard anything about Connor? How he's doing?
I saw him. He's good.
You saw him? I thought...
He's my boyfriend.
Oh, here she is.
Right here, honey.
Afraid you weren't gonna make it.
Yeah, I got hung up at the office.
All right, everybody, let's get started.
First up, team one.
They stole our dystopian robot theme.
Up next, team two.
I knew it, she's not dancing,
they only have five, so we win.
Wait, is that like a digital dancer?
But, how did she do that?
With her computer?
Is that like a projection? They can't have a fake dancer.
Can they?
That looks so real, right?
I can't believe she did all this with a computer!
Our daughter is a genius!
Hey. What's up?
Judge Ringer's office called.
He wants to see you two and Callie in his chambers.
How soon?
How soon can you get there?
I... I'm sorry. I have other appointments.
I'm not going to be able to wait.
Something must have happened. Can we reschedule?
I'm afraid not.
Hey, I'm sorry.
I missed the bus on the way over here
and I forgot my phone at home.
I... I had to run half the way over here.
Thanks for driving us home.
Oh, it's fine, I'm sorry your moms couldn't stay to celebrate.
We will tonight.
You're welcome, by the way.
For what?
If you hadn't tripped over my skateboard,
you would have never come up with all that.
How did you make that dancer that wasn't there?
Oh, we um... we used the motion sensors
from the video game console,
and then we hacked it
so we could record Emma doing the choreography in front of it,
and then we just applied that
to one of the avatars we made to look like one of the dancers.
I have no idea what you just said.
I hope the baby is smart like you.
Have you thought about keeping the baby?
I mean, if you want to, I think you should.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry, I just...
I need a second.
Is something wrong?
I just... I got a sharp pain.
Like labor?
I don't think so.
That's usually more cramp-like.
OK, um, should we... I think we should go to the hospital.
How? She can't drive.
Fine. I'll drive.
Why do you get to drive?
For one thing, I'm a way better driver than you.
You had to take the test twice.
Because it was too easy.
Yeah, that's why people fail tests,
because they're too easy.
And besides, you have a hurt ankle.
That's not my driving leg!
You know what...?
I think it passed.
I'm fine. I... Yeah, I can drive.
Let's, um... Let's get you home...
I still think that we should go to the hospital.
Sacred Cross is only a few blocks from here.
Yeah, OK.
So, I understand you've been trying to get Callie emancipated.
Your Honor, we just, we feel
like Callie deserves a choice in this and...
They're right.
They're right.
So, uh...
I signed them.
Look, I don't want you to get emancipated.
And I don't wanna be my father.
But I... I believe what you said.
That I'm your dad.
No matter what.
I am...
...officially withdrawing my suit for custody.
Are you OK?
Ooh, I think the baby's coming.
OK, OK, the hospital is just a couple blocks from here.
Can you make it?
We are gonna celebrate so big when I get home tonight!
Maybe we should wait until I'm officially adopted?
I don't want to jinx anything.
Nothing's gonna stop us now, Callie.
Just keep breathing, we're almost there. You can do this.
All right, I'll get home... as soon as I can.
See you when I get home.
Love you.
Great. Bye.
Bye.
We got a two-car accident on Mission and E.
One recorded fatality.
Repeat, one recorded fatality.
requesting medical back up.
Officer Adams Foster, I'm right near there,
I'm on my way.
