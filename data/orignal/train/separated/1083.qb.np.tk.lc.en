pink panthers-- most dangerous gang of thieves in the world .
neal plans to infiltrate the gang .
i want a contract .
pink panthers for my freedom .
it has to be ironclad .
you deserve to .
so woodford wants us to break into this company
called atlas tech .
inside that vault is a digital file named &quot; exodus . &quot;
what &apos;s in the file ?
looks more like a complex algorithm to me .
it draws lines between variables ,
connecting them in a seemingly arbitrary manner .
international airports , international airlines .
so whatever they &apos;re transporting
is going in and out of the country .
it &apos;s almost an impossible heist .
unless you have the algorithm .
it looks like the pink panthers have disappeared .
there &apos;s been no word for days .
i &apos;ve heard nothing from luc .
what about keller ?
nothing .
it &apos;s too quiet .
any chance the panthers are onto you ?
maybe keller said something .
if they were onto me ,
i &apos;d be getting a lot worse than the silent treatment .
where were you this morning ?
home .
came from a different direction .
okay , i see what &apos;s going on here .
oh , really ? enlighten me .
you &apos;re having separation anxiety .
it &apos;s totally natural .
no , we &apos;re never separated enough for me to be anxious about it .
but without my anklet ,
you can &apos;t track my every movement ,
and it &apos;s driving you crazy .
i &apos;ll admit , i sleep better
when that dot tells me
exactly where you are .
i hear lavender &apos;s good for sleep .
i &apos;ll adjust .
maybe a sound machine .
let the crash of waves wash away your anxiety .
how about you worry more about the panthers
and less about my rem cycles .
if we don &apos;t take these guys down--
what are you not telling me ?
i pushed for the panthers &apos; case .
i turned down f.b.i resources
and guaranteed that we could take them down on our own .
i have to deliver .
what happens if you don &apos;t ?
mm , something along the lines of an early @-@ retirement package
and a box for my mugs .
where are we ?
we fed the algorithm from the exodus file into the computer
and accessed the randomizer .
what did you get ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
we &apos;re working on decoding the data , but it takes time .
well , we know the panthers are targeting something
that &apos;s arriving at an airport .
that could be anything .
on a daily basis , you got everything
from jewels to currency
to valuable documents going in and out of airports .
so we don &apos;t know what it is , when it &apos;s happening ,
or at which airport .
we do know the panthers have gone underground .
i could try to draw them out .
nah , it &apos;s too risky .
keep working on the algorithm .
it &apos;s our best shot at figuring out what they &apos;re up to .
i got them the stamp and the exodus file .
it doesn &apos;t make sense for the panthers to be shutting me out .
well , i &apos;ve been told separation anxiety &apos;s completely natural .
panthers ?
no , it &apos;s just mozzie .
十万火急
you &apos;re late .
late for what ?
what are you wearing ?
i received an anonymous message
at one of my drop sites this morning--
just a time , 10 : 23 a.m. ,
and a place , brooklyn promenade .
you think the message is from the pink panthers ?
they &apos;re preparing for the big score .
naturally they want the best of the best .
i think they &apos;re wooing me .
i don &apos;t think they know who you are .
can you blame them ?
you take every precaution to stay unknown .
but you &apos;ve told them about my extensive contributions ,
haven &apos;t you ?
you haven &apos;t .
it &apos;s complicated .
the stamp , the exodus file ,
none of that would have happened without my expertise .
i know , and you know how much i appreciate it .
uh , not enough to mention me to your new friends .
the panthers aren &apos;t my friends ,
and they &apos;re not the gentlemen thieves they used to be .
they &apos;re dangerous .
i have a lot riding on this mission .
i &apos;m not even sure about my own position in the group .
i haven &apos;t been contacted in days .
it &apos;s not the time to be suggesting new recruits .
moz .
you &apos;re right .
thank you for understanding .
no , no , not about that .
you should have told the panthers about me .
but you &apos;re right .
the message wasn &apos;t from them .
who &apos;s it from ?
it occurs to me now there &apos;s something
i may have failed to mention .
who am i looking for ?
aubergine frock , reading a book .
who is that ?
moz , who is she ?
she &apos;s my wife .
wait , you have a wife ?
yes , technically i am united in matrimony .
in the traditional sense ?
yes .
we were married by a justice of the peace--
a real one .
haven &apos;t seen her in five years , since the honeymoon .
you never even mentioned her .
i never found quite the right time .
wait . you said five years ?
yes , i was at a low point .
me too , as i recall . i was in prison .
and i was out a best friend and a partner in crime .
did you know that 20 % of people
meet their spouse at work ?
so you met your wife on a con ?
i was posing as a finnish baron .
opening night of il trovatore at the met .
my suit was tailored ,
my cover was impeccable ,
but my heart wasn &apos;t in it ...
until i saw her .
her name was eva perkins ,
a young widow , the inheritor of a sizable fortune--
lonely , wealthy ,
a perfect mark for my sweetheart con .
we had a whirlwind romance .
after only a few days together , we rushed to the altar .
the con was going perfectly ,
and then the real truth came out .
we discovered we were both pulling a sweetheart con
on each other .
but we had both successfully conned
an expert con artist ,
and that could be worth a fortune .
so we pooled our resources
and went on a honeymoon con to morocco .
i know this doesn &apos;t end with
&quot; and they lived happily ever after . &quot;
no , our fairy @-@ tale ending
was more in the traditional german oeuvre .
tragedy , betrayal ,
diminutive men led astray by a cunning vixen .
precisely .
she stole my half of the score
and abandoned me in a marrakech train station .
that was the last you saw of her ?
yeah . i always knew that she would return ...
groveling , wanting me back .
five years is a long time to wait to grovel .
yeah , i should go it alone from here .
if i &apos;m gonna break her heart ,
i &apos;m gentleman enough to do it privately .
of course .
let her down easy , moz .
i should have known by the appointed time--
10 : 23 .
october 23rd--
the anniversary of our very first con together .
dr. and mrs. coleridge .
it &apos;s very good to see you again ...
dr. coleridge .
i always did like this necklace .
you &apos;re out of practice .
but you &apos;re not .
i &apos;m surprised you still have it .
i wanted something to remember you by .
my half of the moroccan silver wasn &apos;t enough ?
something sentimental .
you are not the sentimental type .
i &apos;m not here to rehash the past .
i want to talk about the future .
i &apos;d be lying if i said i was surprised .
you were expecting this ?
of course .
you have to remember , eva , people like you and me--
we &apos;re solitary hunters .
we &apos;re like the african civet .
our musk is alluring , but we &apos;re meant to prowl alone .
mozzie , i want a divorce .
she &apos;s getting remarried . can you believe it ?
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m having a hard time wrapping my mind around .
did you know he was married ?
i was in jail when this happened .
i was told to come home so i could have lunch with my wife .
i &apos;m here .
yeah , and here &apos;s lunch .
honey , will you get the plates ?
she was talking to me .
oh , but i know where the plates are .
since when ?
he moved them before you got here .
he creates chaos to cope with change .
oh , and your spices are now next to the sink .
you all know i &apos;m not a meddler ,
but eva has left me no choice .
moz , i know this isn &apos;t easy ,
but if she &apos;s in love with somebody else ,
you got to let her go .
oh , is that your consensus , that she &apos;s really in love ?
maybe i &apos;m old @-@ fashioned ,
but i do believe that &apos;s why people get married .
has my very existence not opened your eyes
to a more complex world ?
you really think she &apos;s conning this guy ?
of course .
it &apos;s what she does-- quite excellently--
and what you do with ...
some skill is stop that from happening .
you want me to investigate your wife ?
i want you to stop eva from hurting another innocent victim .
are you sure this isn &apos;t about her last innocent victim ?
i swear my motives are pure .
i @-@ i &apos;ve been doing some research .
her mark is named jack conroy ,
president of a charity for at @-@ risk youth .
well , it is a bit hard to believe that a con artist
marrying the head of a charity is just a coincidence .
exactly .
the target is so obvious , it &apos;s beneath her .
honey , do it for the kids .
all right .
i will look into it ,
but you have to promise me that you &apos;ll stay out of it ,
and you won &apos;t do anything stupid .
absolutely .
oh , good . you &apos;re here .
why am i standing in the lobby of jack conroy &apos;s charity ?
i promised peter we &apos;d stay out of it .
technically , you didn &apos;t promise .
i did , and the suit and i
have our own understanding about truth .
i &apos;m leaving .
no , no , you can &apos;t .
a man of henry statton &apos;s stature requires a boy friday .
who &apos;s henry statton ?
mr. statton , mr. conroy can see you now .
i hear you &apos;re interested in making a donation to our worthy cause .
considering it , but i don &apos;t want to rush into anything .
yes , mr. statton is well aware of how risky it can be
to let emotions cloud his better judgment .
of course , we want all our donors to be well @-@ informed .
it &apos;s important to be aware of what
or , uh , whom i &apos;m committing to .
sometimes an outsider &apos;s expertise is needed .
like good friends ,
to let us know when we &apos;re doing something stupid .
i used to be a lot like you , mr. statton--
fancy cars i never had time to drive ,
wondering if all my hard work would ever make a difference .
and then one day everything changed .
i was the , uh , victim of an armed robbery ,
and being the coward that i am , i ran .
the shooter got me in the leg .
and i realized the fear i felt in that moment
is what so many kids face every day .
i mean , they--they live in war zones .
and after this , i ...
i felt a call to fight with them .
there is still one , uh , serious concern ...
your fiancee .
we haven &apos;t announced our engagement .
oh , henry &apos;s very thorough .
her name is eva perkins ...
size seven shoe , libra , allergic to peanuts .
okay .
and one other thing ...
she &apos;s a con woman .
that &apos;s what you were gonna say , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , we &apos;re concerned that eva might be using you
to get to the charity &apos;s money .
yes , i know about her past , and you &apos;re wrong .
eva is different now .
well , in my experience , once a con , always a con .
well , if i didn &apos;t think people could change ,
i couldn &apos;t do this work .
and it &apos;s that belief that makes you a good mark .
i &apos;m not naive , gentlemen .
i know that charities are a ripe target .
that &apos;s why our accounts are protected .
not even i have access to them .
eva would find a way .
she has bested some of the best .
it &apos;s part of her magnetism .
it sounds like you &apos;ve had the pleasure of meeting her .
no , no .
that &apos;s just conjecture based on extensive research .
well , then we should fix that .
we &apos;re hosting a gala tomorrow night .
come and see what we &apos;re about ,
and once you meet eva , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll love her .
she &apos;s even better than i remember .
of course , if you &apos;re gonna con a guy with a savior complex ,
convince him that you need to be saved .
it &apos;s genius .
i don &apos;t believe it .
she &apos;s got you fooled too ?
oh , i &apos;m not fooled . i &apos;m concerned .
as am i. jack is clearly in too deep .
for you .
you &apos;re thinking with your heart instead of your head .
i &apos;m not . i know eva .
no , you knew her , moz .
that was five years ago .
oh , people don &apos;t change .
look at you . you went to prison .
you got out and went right back to the same game .
we are who we are .
and even we can be blinded by love .
you know i &apos;ve learned that one the hard way .
and who had your back all those times ?
you did , and i have yours now .
if this is about saving a charity , i &apos;m in .
but if it &apos;s just about eva , you should walk away .
trust me .
i require wisdom from the nectar of the gods .
you got it . first pour &apos;s on me .
some journeys need to be walked alone .
you are not what i pictured when eva told me about her ex .
got to say , mozzie ,
her new partner &apos;s definitely an upgrade .
i knew it . eva hasn &apos;t changed .
she &apos;s not in love . she &apos;s still a con artist .
eva has moved on .
i strongly suggest you do the same .
people can get really hurt if they refuse to let go .
you can &apos;t threaten me .
blather all you want . who &apos;s gonna believe you ?
you &apos;re a conspiracy nut and a criminal .
look , face it-- in a game of you against me ,
guys like me win every time .
guys like you , no one even pays attention .
i was right-- mostly .
i never should have let you drink alone .
what happened ?
i was attacked by jack conroy .
he and eva are in on it together .
no , no , no , no ,
i think you &apos;ve had enough nectar of the gods for one night .
i &apos;ve never been of clearer mind .
i should have seen it from the beginning .
he was just too perfect ,
with that fake limp and that real hair .
if jack and eva are working together ,
why would he come clean to you ?
i don &apos;t know .
must i have all the answers ?
isn &apos;t my bloodshed enough ?
you shed blood ?
i can see that you &apos;ve suffered .
he hit me exactly where he knew you couldn &apos;t see it ,
like he does it for a living .
then maybe you should leave this alone .
no cost is too high for justice .
you said you had my back .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to peter tomorrow .
in the meantime , no more altercations ,
really this time .
my wound needs a salve .
i &apos;m getting you a band @-@ aid .
what &apos;s going on ?
we got the airport data off the randomizer .
it gave us the initials sfo .
san francisco international .
they stole the algorithm , now they &apos;ve gone quiet .
this could be the big score .
except it &apos;s going down this afternoon .
the randomizer gave us the airline and the flight number .
the plane arrives today at 2 : 30 p.m. pacific time .
there &apos;s another number , but we can &apos;t figure out what it is .
it could be some kind of code to the shipment .
woodford cut me out .
you think keller told him ?
you &apos;re the new guy .
maybe they don &apos;t quite trust you yet .
all that matters now is stopping them .
well , unless we can get our hands on a g6,
there &apos;s no way to get there in time .
all right , i &apos;m putting the san francisco bureau on it .
get me their asac now .
this whole mission depends on catching these guys in the act .
i &apos;m gonna make sure that happens .
asac rollins . agent burke .
what ?
no , i need to speak with asac rollins .
while you &apos;re on hold ,
there &apos;s another matter that could use our help .
let me guess .
mozzie had a run @-@ in with eva &apos;s fiance .
of course he did . i told you two to stay out of it .
he attacked mozzie after they met .
he attacked him ?
mozzie claims he was beaten .
mozzie also claims the government
uses fluoride to control my mind .
you said you would look into the situation .
transferred to seattle ? why--
i need to speak to whoever is in charge right now .
so you looked into jack and eva ?
they &apos;re clean , as far as i can tell .
and the charity ?
seems legit .
and the accounts are secure .
so , even if they were pulling a con ,
there &apos;s no way to access the funds .
from my experience , whenever someone says ,
&quot; there &apos;s no way this is a con ... &quot;
it &apos;s usually a con .
this is special agent burke .
i &apos;m the asac of the new york white collar division .
my team and i are chasing the pink panthers .
we have intel that they &apos;re targeting a plane
coming into san francisco at 2 : 30 .
yes , today .
make sure he knows the panthers
can sniff out feds from a mile away .
i don &apos;t have to tell you the panthers
are the best in the world .
you &apos;ll need your top team on this .
great . my office will fill you in on the rest .
you &apos;ll know everything we know .
get everything we have on the panthers
and coordinate with san francisco .
we &apos;re compiling it now .
should have it in the next couple of minutes .
i want updates on this every half hour until it &apos;s over .
got it .
we &apos;ll go crazy if we sit here and watch the clock .
we &apos;re back to mozzie again ?
well , he did help you find me and bring down boothe .
that earns him a few minutes of government service .
what do you have in mind ?
this is not what i had in mind when you said &quot; stakeout . &quot;
we can turn on the game if you want .
there &apos;s no game .
no . it &apos;s my car .
they &apos;re here .
the image of that is just extraordinary .
here , you have to capture the moment of truth .
i &apos;m pretty sure the only thing i &apos;m gonna capture
are two people splitting an order of calamari .
i &apos;ve been thinking ...
shh . they &apos;re talking .
oh , if he shushes me one more time in my car--
i want to announce our engagement tonight at the gala .
i want the whole world to know how lucky i am to have you .
oh , i would love that .
and i love you .
oh , they &apos;re good .
well , looks pretty convincing to me .
oh , but , you know , it &apos;s complicated .
because of mozzie ?
i should have mentioned this earlier .
i ran into him yesterday .
how did you run into mozzie ?
oh , here it is . he &apos;s gonna come clean .
here you go .
he came to me with some wild theories about you and me .
oh , i should have known when i asked him for a divorce
he would do something crazy .
he &apos;s probably intimidated by you .
poor thing .
poor thing ?
i &apos;m the victim .
i just feel bad for him .
don &apos;t you dare feel bad for me .
okay , i &apos;m calling it off .
wait . hold on . hold on .
if this were my con , i &apos;d be doing the same thing .
you never drop the act in public in case someone &apos;s listening .
he &apos;s right .
they &apos;re never gonna drop the act until i make them .
mozzie , do not leave this car .
where are you going ?
get back in here .
i would not recommend that .
mozzie , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve decided to sign the divorce papers .
as you know , i am a reasonable man .
you didn &apos;t have to attack me so viciously .
what &apos;s he talking about ?
i have no idea .
i thought we had a nice conversation .
well , it was honest .
i &apos;ll give you that .
i just know you two are planning something .
mozzie , i know that you like to create stories
to deal with things that you don &apos;t understand ,
but you can &apos;t just make wild accusations .
what jack and i have is real .
uh , what you have is as real as his limp ,
and you leave me no choice but to prove it .
mozzie !
i have had enough .
okay , should we go get him ?
no , i think he needs to see this through .
satisfied ?
well , that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
anyone can fake a scar .
mozzie , stop it !
mozzie , stop , please .
haven &apos;t you embarrassed yourself enough ?
let &apos;s go .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m okay .
i will be vindicated .
i don &apos;t think this is what mozzie meant
when he said &quot; moment of truth . &quot;
i think it is .
i think mozzie could be right .
el &apos;s keeping an eye on mozzie
until we figure out what &apos;s going on .
what is going on ?
i &apos;m not sure yet , but i got a hunch .
i &apos;ve uploaded the photos .
based on the angle of the entry ,
it looks like the bullet hit only muscle ,
no tendons , no ligaments .
no permanent damage .
which means no limp .
a shot like that , it &apos;s pretty lucky .
yeah , especially if jack was running away ,
which is what he claims .
if he was running and the shooter was standing up ,
the bullet would have entered at a down angle .
yeah , and this shot looks straight across .
a clean shot , no permanent damage .
i think he did it himself .
he &apos;s creating a story .
rich guy gets shot .
his life flashes before his eyes .
he dedicates that life to others .
yeah , nothing like a come @-@ to @-@ jesus moment
to get people to trust you with their money .
except it isn &apos;t about the money .
the charity &apos;s accounts are secure .
so what &apos;s their angle ?
i just got off the phone with san francisco .
all teams are ready and waiting at the airport .
flight should be arriving in a little more over an hour .
just stay on the phone with these guys
and keep me updated .
this could all be over in a few hours .
yep , here we are , just twiddling our thumbs .
if it would get you to san francisco ,
would you shoot yourself in the leg ?
what are you talking about ?
what if jack &apos;s con is about location ?
he could be using the charity to gain access .
look , they &apos;re hosting a gala
this afternoon at a private gallery .
filled with artwork worth millions of dollars .
so they &apos;re not trying to rip off the charity .
they &apos;re trying to get close to something they want to steal .
if this is really their angle ,
then eva is as good as mozzie says .
i get what he saw in her .
get me an inventory of the artwork at this gallery .
let &apos;s go tell mozzie he was right .
no .
you can do it . come on .
i should have known .
love is the ultimate con .
just because it ended doesn &apos;t mean it wasn &apos;t real .
no . john lennon was right .
reality leaves a lot to the imagination .
his mythos had clearly been affected by paul &apos;s death .
look , i know you cared about her a lot ,
but you said it yourself .
i mean , she stole your half of the score in morocco
and then took off on your honeymoon .
what could be better than that ?
it was a brilliant play .
don &apos;t you want to be with somebody you can trust ?
trust is an illusory crutch
required by those who take comfort in false certainty .
people like eva and i-- we live for the game .
so you thought she &apos;d just come back and pick up the game
where it was left off ?
only this time
i would be the one who took off with her half of the score .
look , she &apos;s made her choice .
there &apos;s no accounting for taste .
moz , there &apos;s gonna be other evas out there .
i find my truest self in solitude .
i &apos;m a loner by nature .
and i have my bees .
you have us .
eva &apos;s free to do whatever she wants .
i &apos;m done for good .
the last chapter of our epic tale
has been penned and sealed with vermillion wax .
hello .
it &apos;s , uh , neal .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m in trouble .
i @-@ i &apos;m tempted to say something about dogs and fleas ,
but you may have heard it before .
i know i made a mistake .
i should have never partnered with jack .
i didn &apos;t realize how good i had it before .
you &apos;ve miscalculated if you think flattery
is my weakness anymore .
you know how dangerous jack can be .
i need your help .
i wouldn &apos;t have called you if i had any other option .
meet me at the gala ...
please .
hey . where &apos;s mozzie ?
we &apos;ve been calling him on his phone ,
but he &apos;s not answering .
he was just here .
he said you were calling , and he stepped outside .
mozzie ?
moz .
who do you think called him ?
eva .
mysterious phone call , he disappears .
she lured him somewhere .
well , it has to be the gala .
it &apos;s about to start .
jack and eva went through a lot of hard work
to set up the perfect plan .
it seems like mozzie would be getting in the way .
no , you &apos;re right .
they have a perfect plan ,
perfect covers they &apos;ve developed for years .
yeah , they &apos;re not gonna want to burn those covers just yet .
so they need a fall guy .
mozzie walked right into a trap .
i &apos;m here to rescue my wife . you can &apos;t stop me .
you were right .
that &apos;s absurd . i &apos;m not the fall guy .
eva knows i &apos;m not foolish enough to walk into a trap .
everyone has a weakness , and eva knows yours .
we know she called you .
she probably told you she was in trouble .
yeah , maybe she even claimed she &apos;s in danger ,
that she &apos;s scared of jack ,
and you believed her because you know jack is dangerous .
because jack himself showed you .
so you came to her rescue exactly like they wanted you to .
they &apos;ve been setting you up from the start .
you two have concocted a fascinating story ,
yet there are holes in your plot ,
namely i can &apos;t be the fall guy for a crime
i &apos;m not going to commit .
yeah , that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to make you commit it .
first you &apos;ll walk up to her .
she &apos;ll be thrilled to see you .
thank you for coming .
you &apos;re my hero .
you know i &apos;d do anything for you .
such bourgeois sentiment would never fall past my lips .
i &apos;m giving you the gist .
she &apos;ll tell you
that she &apos;s made a horrible mistake with jack .
you &apos;re the one i want to be with .
let &apos;s run away together .
i hear that prague is expected to endure the melting
of the ice caps exceptionally well .
but first there &apos;s something she needs you to do .
we need start @-@ up money . prague isn &apos;t cheap .
jack and i had a plan to steal ...
something . we &apos;re not sure what it is yet .
but you should steal it instead .
why me ?
good question .
jack is paranoid . he knows i &apos;m having doubts .
he &apos;s been watching me very closely .
if he catches me ...
we all know what will happen .
don &apos;t worry . i would never let that happen .
come on .
when you &apos;re with eva ,
jack will disable the security system and steal the item .
it has to be something small enough to carry on himself
without being noticed .
jack will give eva the all @-@ clear sign once he has the item ,
then she &apos;ll know it &apos;s safe to send you in .
then he &apos;ll rig the security just in time
for you to walk into the exhibit and get caught red @-@ handed .
hold it right there . i don &apos;t have anything .
jack already stole the item . the charge will never stick .
fair point .
jack and eva will replace the real item with a fake .
and you &apos;ll steal it , pocket it ,
and now you &apos;ll be caught red @-@ handed .
got it .
it &apos;s a decent plan , except for one thing .
eva would never do this to me .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s been trying to persuade us
that she &apos;s a con artist not to be trusted .
yeah , and she &apos;s a really good con with a code .
she would never send me to prison .
that is the ultimate betrayal .
give me the eagle pen .
what ? what are you doing ?
i am proving you both wrong .
excuse me .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
i wasn &apos;t sure that you &apos;d show up .
you would never ask a question you didn &apos;t know the answer to .
you knew i &apos;d come .
so why am i here ?
jack &apos;s furious and paranoid .
he knows there &apos;s something going on between us .
only simple minds would fail to see our connection .
he feels threatened by you .
understandably .
and you know how dangerous he can be when he &apos;s threatened .
no sign of the security box jack tampered with .
it must be on another floor .
no sign of jack here either .
well , my guess is , he &apos;s going after the target right now .
let &apos;s search those other floors .
you &apos;ve seen the inventory . any idea what he &apos;s after ?
victorian jewels , faberge eggs ,
some sketches by matisse--
i &apos;d go for the jewels .
no , it &apos;s the egg .
come with me .
let &apos;s leave together ,
pick up where we left off in morocco .
need i remind you , we never left off in morocco .
i was left alone and broke .
so we &apos;ll rewrite the ending ,
but no more conning our way onto cruise ships .
we &apos;ll go in style .
i do have a taxi ,
but the ferry ride would be long .
but we would find a way to pass the time .
flight &apos;s about to land in san francisco .
any word from diana ?
not yet . should hear something soon .
hey , the security box .
or we could set off on our adventure
with millions in our pockets .
i won &apos;t get that much for my cab .
jack and i were gonna steal something from this gallery ,
but you should do it instead ,
steal it right out from under him .
that is a cruel and brilliant plan .
i @-@ i never should have expected less .
the wires have been rerouted .
jack disabled the alarm so he can pull off the theft .
then he &apos;ll switch the wires back before mozzie walks in .
think you can beat him to the punch ?
i need to know what i &apos;m stealing .
the uncertainty is aggravating my dermatitis .
an easter present from alexander iii
to his lovely wife , maria .
ah , faberge egg .
they &apos;re going for the egg .
see ? this is why you need me .
russian exhibit &apos;s on the fourth floor .
that &apos;s where jack has to be .
all right , go . i got this .
f.b.i.
&quot; man is the only kind of varmint sets his own trap ,
baits it , then steps in it . &quot;
steinbeck .
didn &apos;t he also say you have the right to remain silent ?
i think that was sergeant friday .
yeah . i get those two mixed up .
i want my lawyer .
haven &apos;t gotten to that part yet .
since you clearly don &apos;t need this ,
let me take it off your hands .
now to find his better half .
we have to go .
i &apos;m guessing this wasn &apos;t part of your plan .
what ? it &apos;s part of yours , though , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s safe to assume that by now the f.b.i has jack
and the egg .
how much-- how much time do i have ?
not enough .
oh .
well played .
you were a worthy opponent .
you found my weak spot .
you knew i would come if you called .
somewhere along the line , i misjudged .
this plan would have worked five years ago .
five years ago there would be no neal ,
no suit for that matter .
by myself , i would have walked right into your trap .
you &apos;re not working alone .
i didn &apos;t see that coming .
five years ago , i wouldn &apos;t either .
i &apos;m sorry , mozzie .
no , no .
you &apos;re not , eva .
you &apos;re conning me to help you escape .
it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m not sorry .
i would have done it anyway .
my plan includes a very generous escape hatch .
unlike you , i live by a code .
the alarms have heightened security .
there are guards at every door .
what do you say about one last con ?
after all , they are playing our song .
we lost the eagle . what the hell is mozzie up to ?
are you sure this is what you want after all we &apos;ve shared ?
you know what we have shared ?
nothing but lies and deception .
we &apos;re securing this area . you two can &apos;t do this here .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
you are absolutely right . we can &apos;t do this anymore .
we &apos;re always trying to one up and outsmart each other .
and you &apos;re willing to throw that all away ?
you can &apos;t find what we have with someone else .
i know .
that &apos;s why we have to say good @-@ bye .
you can &apos;t hold me here like a criminal .
i have rights .
what &apos;s going on ?
i have to use the bathroom .
i &apos;m not authorized to let anyone through .
i feel like a caged animal .
that is still such a rush .
i &apos;d ask you to come with me , but--
but-
you won &apos;t ask a question you don &apos;t know the answer to .
where is she ? where &apos;s eva ?
i don &apos;t know . she got away .
the good ones always do .
we have a suspect on the run .
all units be on the lookout for eva perkins .
he &apos;ll never find her .
well , we got jack and the egg .
he &apos;ll be okay .
how about you ?
i &apos;m fine . i have my bees .
well , it looks like you &apos;re a bachelor again .
you ready to find a new sweetheart to con ?
uh , nope .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m taken .
okay .
let me guess . no sign of eva ?
forget eva .
i just got off the phone with the asac in san francisco .
the panthers never showed up .
what ? what happened ?
no idea . damn it , we almost had them .
do we know what they were after ?
we ran a list of the passengers--
nothing suspicious .
diplomats , bank ceos ,
people with access to valuable targets ?
nothing .
what about cargo ?
we &apos;re being stonewalled .
the airline won &apos;t confirm or deny the presence
of anything valuable on the plane .
which means there was something .
exactly .
well , i just mobilized half the agents
in san francisco for nothing ,
and now i got a dozen people above me demanding answers .
there &apos;s something more going on with the panthers ,
something we &apos;re missing .
well , we better find out what that is and soon ,
or else this whole thing is gonna blow up on both of us .
all right , what &apos;s up ?
we have good news .
you know where the panthers are ?
would you settle for knowing what they &apos;re going after ?
based on neal &apos;s missions with the panthers ,
we know the big score has something to do
with braxnet security .
because neal stole the stamp
to clock their security response times .
right , and atlastech ,
where he took the exodus file from .
so , whatever the panthers are targeting ,
it &apos;s something these two companies have in common .
turns out both companies have a long list
of government contracts .
when we cross @-@ referenced their client lists ,
only one remained .
the panthers are going after the fed .
and the fed only handles one thing .
cash . they &apos;re going after cash .
and not just any cash .
we know the flight today was coming from europe , right ?
when americans travel to europe ,
they exchange american currency for euros .
that money &apos;s collected by the central bank
then shipped back to the u.s.
where , according to the randomizer ,
it could be delivered to any one of 12 airports ,
any city with a federal reserve .
i &apos;ve heard of this . it &apos;s completely classified .
not even the f.b.i &apos;s kept in the loop .
that &apos;s why they use the randomizer .
it ensures no one knows when or where the money
will be delivered until the day of the shipment .
so where does braxnet fit into all of this ?
they provide security for the shipment .
the money &apos;s held at airport warehouses
until the fed picks it up and redistributes it .
how much cash are we talking ?
each shipment contains as much as $ 500 million .
and the icing on the cake--
the cash is clean , completely untraceable .
the panthers are going after half a billion dollars
in unmarked cash .
woodford ...
nice of you to drop by .
figured i &apos;d return the favor .
not here to exchange pleasantries , i see .
there &apos;s a small problem .
it seems there &apos;s some mole in the operation .
