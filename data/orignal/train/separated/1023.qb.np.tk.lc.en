peter .
hey .
it &apos;s late .
yeah .
that &apos;s not supposed to be one of monet &apos;s lost frames ?
no , just trying to clear my head .
good . about that .
vincent adler --
seven years ago , he ran a huge ponzi scheme
and disappeared with a billion dollars .
you knew him ?
he &apos;s the man who made me who i am today .
mm @-@ hmm . he &apos;s rained hell down on both our lives .
you knew . you knew , and you didn &apos;t say anything ?
i just figured it out myself , okay ?
i &apos;m trying to reconcile the adler i knew
with the man responsible for --
for kate ? for mozzie ?
yeah .
so let &apos;s get him .
come on .
start talking .
yeah , i &apos;m not much of a beer drinker , so --
i know .
that &apos;s why i brought you this .
oh . i don &apos;t recognize the bottle .
that &apos;s because it cost as much as the beer .
wow . i don &apos;t even need a corkscrew .
nope .
okay .
now ...
how do you know adler ?
it &apos;s a long story .
if we are gonna catch this guy ,
just like i caught you , i need to know everything .
there &apos;s too much to tell .
you &apos;re gonna plead the fifth ?
a few secrets are good , peter --
keeps the mystery alive .
i get it .
this story includes some stuff
about crimes i don &apos;t know about .
yeah .
no . you &apos;re not holding back on me .
we &apos;ve got all night .
i &apos;ll make you a deal .
full immunity for anything you say
from this moment until the sun rises over that balcony .
full immunity ?
did you kill anybody ?
no .
then full immunity .
all right . let &apos;s start with this .
mozzie decoded the music box .
it &apos;s an equation .
this is what it built .
it &apos;s a fractal .
very good . i &apos;ve seen one like it before .
where ?
in vincent adler &apos;s office when i worked for him .
how did you meet him ?
if you want to know about adler ,
we got to start with mozzie .
why am i not surprised ?
it was eight years ago .
i was new to the city ,
didn &apos;t know the east village from the west .
all right , follow the lady .
all you got to do is follow the lady .
i mix them fast , but if your eyes are faster , you win --
simple as that .
lady &apos;s in the middle .
you got good peepers , pal .
want to double up , buddy ?
sure . toss them .
okay . you think you can follow them ,
but i &apos;m saying that you can &apos;t .
it &apos;s all a game of you vs. me .
all right , here we go , here we go .
where is she ? where is she ?
watch her . watch her .
she &apos;s a sneaky lady , but i think she likes you .
she &apos;s on the right .
no , she &apos;s back in the middle .
are you crazy ? she &apos;s definitely on the right .
hey . it &apos;s his money , kid .
crap .
ah , she &apos;s sneaking around on you , boss .
lucky guess .
you &apos;re so good at this ,
why don &apos;t you put your own money down ?
you gonna bet or walk away .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
what you got ?
all right .
$ 50 ? come on , really take this guy .
time to put up or shut up , kid .
it &apos;s up to you .
all right .
let &apos;s go $ 500 .
now we &apos;re talking . all right .
all right , looks like i hooked me a whale here .
yeah .
looky , looky , looky ,
hey , diddle , diddle , the queen &apos;s in the middle .
follow her fast . follow her slow .
my hands are fast . your eyes are slow .
see her ? huh ? see her ?
pick that little lady and you win , my man .
all you got to do is show me the smile on the lady &apos;s face ,
and you walk away with it all .
ah ! you sure ?
yeah . he &apos;s sure .
i &apos;m sure .
fun game , man .
thank you . you toss the broads really well .
damn it !
cado , you want to earn 10 bucks ?
$ 20 .
seriously ?
you gonna stiff me this time ?
go , you little weasel . follow that guy .
he &apos;s in my training program .
i &apos;m the guy from the park .
hey , i &apos;m not here to give you hospital time , kid .
good , &apos; cause i &apos;m not giving you your money back .
ah , keep it .
what &apos;s your angle ?
look , i been running find @-@ the @-@ lady for years ,
and even i didn &apos;t catch that swap .
where &apos;s your partner ?
i left him .
why ?
i need an upgrade .
mozzie had a goatee ?
well , only to distract from his toupee .
oh , we talked .
moz told me about his detroit days .
he &apos;d been running street cons since he was a kid .
mm . notice my lack of surprise .
what does any of this have to do with adler ?
well , he &apos;s the reason mozzie found me .
these forgeries are exquisite .
who says it &apos;s a forgery ?
uh , given your living conditions , i do .
how did you match the tricolor seal ?
just eyeballed it .
by eye ?
mm @-@ hmm .
huh . you are very talented , kid .
with you as my partner ,
we could move way beyond the street hustle .
what did you have in mind ?
a long con ,
which , if executed properly ,
would enable us to purchase and retire
on neighboring temperate @-@ zone islands in a mere six months .
i just got to this city , and i &apos;m too young to retire .
i &apos;m talking about summiting the everest of swindles .
who &apos;s the mark ?
vincent adler ?
yeah .
now this is getting good .
that &apos;s the first time i heard adler &apos;s name .
what ?
those bonds -- that &apos;s the first time i &apos;d come across you .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm .
tell me .
you &apos;re stalling .
no , i &apos;m not . come on .
we got -- we got a long time until sunrise .
we got plenty of beer and ... this . so tell me .
did you have to fight to take my case ?
yeah . it was a real tug @-@ of @-@ war .
here &apos;s another one for you , peter .
stop hoarding all the new cases , burke .
bond forgery sent over from nypd .
two phony atlantic incorporated bonds in six months .
what ? you want it ?
two in half a year ?
mm @-@ hmm .
atlantics have never been forged .
i &apos;ll pass .
all right .
wow . this is quality work .
mm , so is my kid &apos;s drawing on the fridge .
he &apos;s all yours .
okay .
i think this guy has a future .
what was my nickname ?
what ?
come on . every case gets a nickname .
hagen was the dutchman before you i.d. &apos; d him .
what was my nickname ?
oh , don &apos;t recall .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
well , the sooner you remember , the sooner we can move on .
james bonds .
bonds .
james bonds .
james bonds .
yes , yes .
would you like another beer ?
yeah .
shaken , not stirred ?
oh , see , i knew it was a mistake telling you .
believe me , yours was just one file
in a giant stack of cases .
yeah .
but it was on top .
you weren &apos;t that good .
this guy &apos;s good .
honey , come on -- are we gonna put this away ,
or is that our new coffee table ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
what about this one is getting under your skin ?
you really want to hear about this ?
well , of course , always .
all right .
satchmo !
he &apos;s tampering with federal evidence .
wow . that &apos;s a forgery ?
the seal , the signature , the security strip .
see , most forgers are only experts at one aspect .
the man who forged this bond is capable of bigger things .
he can do it all .
well , so can you .
lose the &apos; stache ?
yeah , sorry , magnum . i still love you .
i love you , too .
satchmo -- elizabeth named him ?
how do you know i didn &apos;t ?
well , elizabeth likes old jazz .
you don &apos;t .
don &apos;t forget i knew a fair amount about you before it was over .
hmm . know thine enemy .
know thyself , and you will win a hundred battles .
mozzie &apos;s influence ?
big student of history .
tell me how you went after adler .
he was a big fish .
there he is , our white whale .
what did you find out about him ?
well , he &apos;s the c.e.o. of adler financial management ,
and he runs their top hedge fund .
good . what &apos;d he bring in ?
i don &apos;t know .
never say that . know everything .
adler made $ 150 million last year ,
up 8 % from the prior year .
know thine enemy , and you will win -- sun tzu .
all right . what &apos;s the con ?
well , adler routes a hefty percentage of his profits
into an account in the caymans every six months .
tax @-@ free ?
exactly .
all we need to reroute his next wire transfer
is two pieces of information --
account number and password .
that &apos;s where you come in .
where does he keep it --
personal safe , deposit box ?
in his head .
he &apos;s too smart to keep it anywhere else .
i can &apos;t just walk up and ask him for it .
that &apos;s impossible .
a wise man once said it &apos;s fun to do the impossible .
bertrand russell ?
walt disney .
you should read more .
our clock is five months .
you &apos;ll ingratiate yourself , become a trusted friend ,
then convince him to tell you .
why don &apos;t you do it ?
i &apos;m more the behind @-@ the @-@ scenes guy .
all right , look at me , and then look in the mirror .
who has a better chance of charming adler
at the charity dinner on friday ?
the antiquities recovery project ?
it &apos;s five grand a plate . i can &apos;t afford that .
well , you can if you cash in a few more of your bonds .
big mistake .
cashing those bonds was a calculated risk .
but it was worth it for the con we were about to run on adler .
yeah , but bankrolling them
got us our first visual on you .
if i recall ,
i wasn &apos;t the only one who made a mistake that day .
no , hang on , hang on .
yeah .
yeah , it was that bank in midtown .
did you get it ?
yep .
the teller was a sweetheart .
oh , she gave you a sucker .
you know , the irony of that
would not be lost on alanis morissette .
this guy &apos;s a forger . he &apos;s good .
what ?
shh . brooks brothers suit .
yes , i understand .
so ?
so that means fed -- talking to the bank manager .
we got to go .
... these bonds , i want you to call me immediately .
never met a fed before .
let &apos;s keep it that way .
detain him if possible .
absolutely .
good .
excuse me .
sorry , i @-@ i couldn &apos;t help but overhear .
are you with the fbi ?
special agent peter burke .
wow .
i @-@ i just took some money out of the bank ,
and you heard you talking about counterfeiting .
your money &apos;s safe . i &apos;m looking after counterfeit bonds .
well , i have some bonds at home .
how would i know if they &apos;re not real ?
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re fine .
well , thanks again for
all the hard work you &apos;re doing , agent burke .
that &apos;s for you . have a good day .
he &apos;s not a nanny goat in a petting zoo .
he &apos;s a fed .
within minutes , he could have set up a five @-@ block perimeter --
hundreds of trench @-@ coated g @-@ men .
it was worth it . we now know two things .
we got to move off bonds , and his name is peter burke .
know thy enemy , right ?
fine .
now you &apos;ve got the money to pay for the invitation .
what name you gonna use ?
i don &apos;t know .
halden .
nicholas halden .
quaint .
get yourself a few aliases . you &apos;re gonna need them .
oh , pop quiz , hot shot --
adler &apos;s market strategy pre @-@ crash ?
short derivatives , bullish on commodities .
mm . you have learned much , grasshopper .
why are you filling that bottle with bargain red ?
have you studied adler &apos;s wine list ?
is that the &apos; 91 bordeaux ?
the one year it was corked in the wrong bottle .
$ 800 a pop .
i , of course , got this bottle empty .
best served when the guests are drunk .
and i asked my cleaner to keep an eye out
for something in your size .
yeah , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m a suit guy .
ah , you &apos;ll be fine .
well , i really appreciate you coming . thanks .
mr. adler ?
nick halden . nice to meet you .
i brought this from my collection .
that &apos;s very generous . thanks for coming .
hey , nice play on the emerging markets last quarter .
you really called russia .
well , it all came down to grains , didn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
where do you think they &apos;re going ?
bull market .
for us , not europe .
i &apos;d say their imports are up 20 % .
interesting . enjoy the party .
raphael &apos;s saint george and the dragon --
it &apos;s a powerful piece .
commodities and art ? you &apos;ve got diverse interests .
like you , art is my passion .
then you should talk to my assistant .
nick halden .
hi .
i &apos;m kate moreau .
hi .
you like it ?
what ? what ? oh , yeah .
no , it &apos;s , uh --
it &apos;s breathtaking .
it &apos;s my favorite one .
raphael was a master of balance --
thick brush strokes for the landscape ,
but the skin tones are almost ... translucent .
are you an artist ?
i dabble .
i tried ,
but the romance of being a starving artist
wore off very fast .
well , you won &apos;t find any original nick haldens
at a gallery downtown .
what do you do ?
i &apos;m looking for new opportunities .
excuse me , sir . may i take that ?
oh . thank you .
you &apos;re here to cozy up to my boss .
if i work for adler , i can go anywhere .
any advice ?
i &apos;ve seen the seating chart , and you &apos;re nowhere near him .
that &apos;s your first challenge .
hi .
i like a challenge .
good luck , nick .
thanks .
it seems my date
has been relegated to the buenos aires table .
you have until the salad course arrives
to tell me what you want .
go .
i want to work for you .
in what capacity ,
other than your enthusiasm for grains and paint ?
acquisitions .
my team is full .
cameron singer -- you &apos;re about to buy his firm .
speculation &apos;s been front page of the journal all week .
pass the bread .
well , he &apos;s been avoiding that woman .
hannah fields ?
next week , hannah fields
will announce her new investment branch .
she &apos;s buying out singer .
he &apos;s gonna back out of your deal ,
and the media will eat it up .
your company will appear unstable .
that could spook investors .
i &apos;m gonna continue my meal now
with someone who looks better in an cocktail dress than you .
well , look into singer .
if it turns out i &apos;m right , call me .
the singer deal -- was it true ?
absolutely . mozzie and i had been spying on them for weeks .
adler ditched singer and brought me in a month later .
he hired you to find things for him to buy .
well , part of my job was
knowing everything about everyone adler dealt with .
he had a lot of holdings and a lot of enemies .
turns out i had a knack for rooting them out .
and kate was there the whole time .
is that when you guys got together ?
no , no . she had a boyfriend .
it &apos;s not there .
all right , we &apos;ll just have to try again .
remind me again why i let you
make my favorite necklace disappear .
because ... you like magic .
someday you &apos;re going to tell me all of your secrets .
i mean it .
may i ?
maybe someday .
come out with me on friday .
i , um -- i have your assignment from adler .
he wants you to look into this .
right .
looks like someone &apos;s been
looking into his recent art acquisitions .
nick ?
michael asked me to move to chicago with him .
chicago ?
are you gonna go ?
um , i @-@ i am , in a month .
it &apos;s a big step .
yeah . i know .
well , you &apos;ll like chicago .
they , uh -- they have a great art museum ,
and decent pizza .
little windy .
yeah , i &apos;ve heard that .
i should just get this ...
i need to get back to work .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a fractal -- a mathematical curiosity .
that was the first time you &apos;d seen one ?
yeah . you know , he was obsessed with them .
his were similar to that one , but none was an exact match .
okay , so , kate was going to chicago with another guy ,
and you were trying to root out
whoever was looking into adler &apos;s stuff .
keep talking .
you found the culprit .
she talked her way in .
she seems mostly interested in your south american acquisitions .
and you got her to come here in person ?
i had the foundation feed her a story
that they were impressed with her research .
she thinks she &apos;s here for a job interview .
bring her in .
yes , sir .
miss hunter .
alex hunter .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you .
have a seat .
miss hunter .
your passion for antiquities
is unusual for such a young woman .
well , every object has a story to tell .
i find those stories fascinating .
that was almost convincing .
who are you working for ?
i don &apos;t work for anyone ... yet .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
you can drop the act .
someone is paying you to get into my records .
now , who is that ? why don &apos;t you tell me ?
sir , maybe it would be best if we ...
what are you looking for ?
there were rumors you made some big discoveries .
i got curious .
i thought you wanted to share your art with the world .
that &apos;s for me to decide .
you accessed my private database .
you made copies of my records .
i should bring charges .
everybody gets one big mistake in life
and one opportunity to fix it .
i believe in second chances , miss hunter .
i think you &apos;re clever enough to know what i mean .
thanks , nick .
grateful to be here , mr. adler .
vincent .
your hard work deserves a reward .
thank you .
i know i don &apos;t meet the buy @-@ in , but ...
nick , come on , now . we &apos;ve talked about this .
you know i don &apos;t like my people to invest in the fund .
you &apos;ve made exceptions .
for you .
thank you , sir .
you invested your money with him .
all of it .
we all did . he was making us 14 % .
you didn &apos;t know it was a scam ?
no .
my goal at the time was to prove my loyalty to adler .
the job became my life .
then what happened to alex ?
i know there &apos;s more to that story .
you &apos;re sweet .
nice trick .
you got me .
you got off easy .
too late to apologize .
i &apos;m not gonna apologize . it &apos;s my job to catch you .
it &apos;s your job to not get caught .
fair enough .
what do you want ?
buy me a drink , and we &apos;ll talk .
let &apos;s go .
nick halden -- that &apos;s a good name .
not your real one , but i like it .
i recognize a fellow grifter when i see one , nick .
all right .
humor me , alex .
what were you really looking for ?
something adler doesn &apos;t have .
he has everything .
he doesn &apos;t have this .
it &apos;s a music box .
quite the holy grail .
it &apos;s worth about as much .
so alex turned you on to the music box .
yeah , she &apos;d been chasing it for years .
she heard adler had information on it .
did he ?
he had a rumor that it was
at the amalienborg palace in copenhagen .
said she &apos;d send me a message
if she ever needed my help getting it .
what kind of message ?
a flower .
did she ever send it ?
yeah , but that &apos;s another part of the story .
alex disappeared , and kate --
well , things changed .
you &apos;re taking a sick day ?
i &apos;m not allowed to feel lousy ?
every day with adler counts .
i &apos;ve already got the siphon in place .
all we need is the password .
i &apos;ll get the password .
you know , i &apos;m sensing your heart isn &apos;t totally into this .
my heart is fine .
ah . this is about the girl .
i thought she left for chicago .
she left today .
you know , it &apos;s probably for the best .
now you can focus .
i got to go , okay ?
kate ?
you &apos;re supposed to be in chicago .
it &apos;s a big step ...
in the wrong direction .
why ?
because you &apos;re here .
so you and adler developed a connection ,
and you and kate were finally together .
you had it all .
yeah , i was eating the best food ,
wearing the best suits , drinking the best wine --
the kind that has corks .
it was the perfect life .
and it was also the perfect lie .
you and mozzie were still working the long con .
trying to make the lie real .
but every con has an expiration date .
adler makes the transfer on friday ,
and you still haven &apos;t gotten the password yet .
i said i &apos;ll get it , i &apos;ll get it .
oh , good , because i thought you were having second thoughts
about abandoning your new town @-@ and @-@ country lifestyle .
don &apos;t kid yourself .
kate doesn &apos;t even know your real name .
none of them do .
they care about me , okay ? she cares about me .
um , no .
she cares about nick halden , and he doesn &apos;t exist .
i hear the suit &apos;s been asking around about you .
he has a sketch .
where &apos;d he get a sketch ?
oh , they always have a sketch or a print or something .
look , it &apos;s time to finish this job and move on .
let &apos;s have a look at you .
never worn a custom suit before .
the fit is perfect ...
except for the cuff .
the break should be an eighth of an inch above the shoe .
nelson .
good eye , sir .
i can &apos;t accept . this is a $ 10,000 suit .
you can and you will .
some people say dress for the job you want .
i say dress as the man you want to be .
nick , men like you and i -- we have an obligation
to assault the commonplace every chance we get ,
from the clothes we wear to the art we collect
to the women in our lives .
you and kate have gotten close .
yeah .
you look good together .
how does she feel about it ?
there are things about me that i haven &apos;t told her .
i wouldn &apos;t worry .
oftentimes , the things we try and hide
are the most obvious to the people around us .
everything all right ?
nelson , would you excuse us for a moment ?
of course .
thanks .
there &apos;s something you should know .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i flagged a small irregularity
in your account in the caymans .
trace @-@ analysis reports were inconclusive .
what kind of irregularity ?
blips from a random i.p. address .
hacker ?
it &apos;s probably someone from the bank , confirming .
but i &apos;d have to look into the account details to be sure .
you &apos;d need the password .
i &apos;ll arrange a time for us
to go to the bank so you can access it yourself .
no , no .
i trust you .
bank closes at 6 : 00 . burn this when you &apos;re done .
don &apos;t sell yourself short .
kate &apos;ll love you for who you really are ...
as will others .
you like the hat ?
i could get used to it .
are you all dressed up with somewhere else to go ?
no , i just have to be somewhere by 6 : 00 .
it &apos;s a commitment i made a long time ago .
i think that you should blow off that commitment .
yeah ?
look . our violinist agrees .
you are staying here with me .
i promised a friend . i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t back out of it .
kate , i &apos;m ...
what &apos;s wrong , nick ?
i just feel like --
you and me and all this -- i don &apos;t know .
i feel like i could blink , and it &apos;d all be gone .
you just blinked .
i &apos;m still here .
then nothing else matters .
you didn &apos;t get the password .
you said it yourself . this is a long con .
you stepped on the brakes when you should have leaned in .
it &apos;s kate , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m in love with her .
every con man gets his heart broken once .
she &apos;s not gonna break my heart .
well ...
... we &apos;ll get them next time .
love is a temporary madness .
it erupts like an earthquake and then subsides .
st. augustine .
good . you &apos;ve been reading .
a smart guy told me to .
oh , my god .
i want more .
what ?
you &apos;re insatble .
pizza .
what ?
we have half a margherita left over from last night .
wait , hold on . whoa -- who said you get the sheet ?
no , no , no , no , no .
yes , i get it .
all right .
mine .
all right .
nick .
what ?
the neighbors can see you .
oh . hi , neighbors .
should i give them a little show ?
no . here .
look . there .
ooh , i got a hat , too .
now you &apos;re presentable .
all right .
you like that ?
put some pants on .
... floors of wall street .
you got the sheet .
you don &apos;t get the last slice .
it &apos;s only fair .
vincent adler has disappeared , and with him
hundreds of millions of dollars of his clients &apos; money .
a preliminary investigation indicates his investment firm
may have been built on a giant house of cards .
securities regulators now claim
adler never traded any shares for client accounts .
if true , adler &apos;s disappearance could prove to be
the brilliant exit strategy
for one of the greatest financial frauds of our time .
holy cow . can you believe it ?
who &apos;d have figured ?
nobody saw this coming ? huh .
this guy took thousands of people
for their life savings , including charities .
clinton jones .
word around here is that you &apos;re putting together
a special white @-@ collar task force .
i am .
well , i &apos;ve only been here a few months .
but i was wondering ,
if there were some spots open , if i could get a shot .
are you the one who put the dutchman on our radar ?
yes , sir . i studied a profile like his at quantico .
well , i can &apos;t promise anything .
it is a long list , agents with more seniority --
you know how it is .
that &apos;s not the same sucker
you got from james bonds last year , is it ?
people talk .
yeah .
well , nobody gets why i &apos;m still holding on to this .
unfinished business .
i get it .
so , adler disappeared , but what about his account ?
there was only a dollar left in it .
the password was an anagram
for &quot; nice try neal . &quot;
then what happened with kate ?
no money , no jobs .
it &apos;s all gone .
i know . i know . hey , hey .
we &apos;re gonna be okay .
it &apos;s just you and me now , right ?
that &apos;s all that matters . come here .
we &apos;re gonna get it all back , okay ?
okay .
how ?
okay , if we &apos;re gonna do this ,
i need to tell you something about me .
what ?
i &apos;m not nick halden .
my name &apos;s neal caffrey .
you and kate lost everything .
yeah . adler paid well .
we put it right back into the company .
and why not ? everything he touched turned to gold .
he conned us .
he conned everybody ... and then disappeared .
what happened after you told kate the truth ?
i thought this was about adler .
well , i just got a few beers left ,
and i &apos;m curious .
i taught her to survive .
hey , you , stop ! someone stop that guy !
freeze ! put your hands up !
hey . get up .
officer , this man stole my package .
i did no such thing .
whoa , whoa , be careful with that .
it &apos;s the falconer manuscript from the 16th century .
hey , i recognize this guy .
oh . how you doing , smedley ?
this guy &apos;s got warrants out in three different states .
thanks to you , we can get him off the streets .
write him a receipt .
you can &apos;t take that . it &apos;s worth a fortune .
we &apos;ll look after you , okay ?
bring this to the 23rd precinct .
pick it up from evidence in a few days .
days ? !
23rd .
i &apos;m a little sick of being scalped
every time we pull one of these .
you know , moz , you look better without the hairpiece .
very handsome .
hale takes a cut . we split the rest three ways .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s not bad .
to all this .
to the best of times .
and to ...
our villa on the c ? te d &apos;azur ,
the sun setting over the mediterranean .
the olive trees whispering in the hills .
let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s go .
now ?
you want to go to france now ?
yeah .
look , that fbi agent -- burke .
he &apos;s been asking around about the british pounds .
maybe-- i don &apos;t know .
maybe we should take some time away ,
outside the fbi &apos;s range .
we can start in cap d &apos;antibes while it &apos;s still warm ,
work our way up to paris ,
over to amsterdam , then copenhagen .
i &apos;m not going to copenhagen .
okay , i should &apos;ve mentioned alex .
this isn &apos;t about alex , neal .
you can &apos;t just say ,
&quot; hey , kate , let &apos;s go to copenhagen
for this opportunity alex told me about . &quot;
you just tried to con me .
i made a mistake , okay ?
i &apos;m doing this for us .
that music box is worth a fortune .
it can give us the life we want .
you went to copenhagen without her .
yeah . the box was there .
but it was a three @-@ person job .
without kate , it fell apart .
alex ended up in a french hospital , and i barely escaped .
but someone at the palace pointed the finger at you .
everyone thought you had the box .
i didn &apos;t correct them .
sure . it gave you great street cred .
i came back to new york .
kate was gone .
well , she learned something from me ,
&apos;cause she disappeared .
i started running big cons .
guess i was trying to get her attention .
well , you certainly got ours ,
steve tabernackle .
you knew about steve ?
we knew a lot of things .
before returning to new york ,
caffrey popped up in denmark and france .
he &apos;s not afraid to cross borders .
he definitely does his homework .
we flagged his aliases at all ports of entry .
i mean , when we get a hit , we throw up roadblocks .
no , he &apos;ll never use the same i.d. twice .
tell me something i haven &apos;t heard .
what about you ?
agent ...
berrigan .
you &apos;re on the run . how do i catch you ?
stake out my girlfriend ?
well , caffrey has one , right ?
we think they split up .
well , but we know where she is .
does she know we &apos;re onto her ?
no .
we &apos;ve never had enough on her to bring her in .
and he hasn &apos;t gone anywhere near her .
hang on .
it took us months to catch her ,
and she never stays in the same place for more than a week .
she &apos;s hiding from him .
he doesn &apos;t know where she is .
hey , ruby &apos;s in burma .
i &apos;m gonna need a bush plane to get --
oh , no .
did your pigeon die ?
no , estelle &apos;s fine -- best homer in the city .
then what ?
i received some news .
some ... information has surfaced on the street .
kate ?
y @-@ you have to understand .
it comes from a highly unreliable source .
where is she ?
his name is jimmy the snitch .
i need a location .
neal , this smells like a trap .
i don &apos;t care . i need to see her .
it &apos;s a storage facility .
she &apos;ll be there this afternoon .
all right . thanks .
neal .
be careful .
forging raphael .
you &apos;ve gotten good .
i heard the real painting was stolen .
i hoped it would get your attention .
it did .
i missed you .
i lied to you about a lot of things , kate ,
but i never lied about loving you .
i believe you .
i love you , too .
how did you find me ?
well , moz heard you were fencing mauritian penny stamps .
i quit dealing in stamps .
it &apos;s okay .
fbi ! hands on your head !
agent burke .
neal caffrey . you &apos;re under arrest .
i know .
thank you .
i never would have found her without you .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
so you guys were all in that municipal van out front ?
that &apos;s got to be uncomfortable .
doesn &apos;t smell too good , either .
and you know the rest .
all right , so what do we do next ?
we find adler .
he &apos;s the key to this whole damn thing .
well , i &apos;ve looked .
his trail didn &apos;t go cold ,
peter . there is no trail .
i caught you when i found out what you wanted most .
we know what he wants most .
the fractal .
yeah .
what is this ?
you have any ideas ?
it must mean something , must point somewhere .
are you telling me the truth , neal ?
why do you ask ?
i only know one of your friends who &apos;s into origami .
alex has been here .
and this receipt is from today .
what does she think it is ?
it &apos;s a fractal antenna .
they &apos;re in everything now .
there &apos;s one in your cellphone .
and this shape corresponds to a specific frequency
for an emergency beacon .
emergency beacon ?
you &apos;re telling me that if we build a real one of these
and we hook that up to a radio --
it &apos;s gonna lead us to a boat or a plane
or something that disappeared in the 1940s .
something worth killing two people ,
something worth all this ?
it &apos;s worth it to adler .
