if i take something to help me sleep ,
i &apos;ll be groggy for the meeting .
but if i don &apos;t take anything and i don &apos;t sleep ,
i &apos;ll be groggy for the meeting , you know ?
i was up for re @-@ election as social chair
of our local realtors group .
the vote was tonight .
i was so nervous ,
i could barely hear claire &apos;s pep talk .
why did i beg mitchell
to introduce me to this developer ?
you &apos;re right . we &apos;ll know soon enough .
i &apos;m gonna go upstairs , see if i can get some sleep .
love you .
i hope so , too .
hello ?
hey , gil .
no , no , no . you -- you didn &apos;t wake me .
um , so , you hear anything , or ...
hey , dunphy .
just wrapping up a phone call with this jackass .
i got to run , dunphy .
i got a late meeting with some jackass .
what &apos;s going o-- what &apos;s going on ?
the people have spoken , dunphy .
i &apos;m in . you &apos;re out .
sorry to have to tell you that in private .
was it even close ?
no ! i have a mandate --
not the kind you hide from your wife , either .
i can &apos;t believe it . i &apos;m a one @-@ termer ?
that puts me alongside henry eustace tyler
and art wagner !
never met art wagner .
they took away his
realtor &apos;s license after gategate .
okay , enough history , &quot; done @-@ for . &quot;
fork over the hardware .
gil , as my predecessor told me ,
respect the office , respect the medallion .
ooh , shiny .
how often do you clean this thing ?
every time i shower .
well , don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s gonna get a good buffing tonight
when it &apos;s swinging against the back of my wife &apos;s head .
that is not respecting the medall--
so , after we pick up my allergy medication ,
you drop manny and i at the museum .
why do you even have to go ?
ay , other mothers are going to the field trip , too .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not going to be all over you ,
trying to suffocate you .
don &apos;t talk like that .
i hate crowded elevators .
only one thing worse --
when they stop and you get trapped .
actually , there &apos;s one thing even worse than that .
it &apos;s okay , sir . there &apos;s no need to panic .
getting trapped with him .
i don &apos;t even know the guy &apos;s name .
he belongs to my club .
but for whatever reason ,
he has the knack for showing up
when i &apos;m at my absolute worst .
be right back .
here , let me help you .
maybe we should help someone else .
oh , don &apos;t be frightened .
big step !
who &apos;s next ?
i &apos;m sorry . pepper &apos;s getting a what for your wedding ?
a d.p.
no !
no , a director of photography .
yeah , apparently , he &apos;s a big deal .
he won a golden globe .
no , you win an oscar .
you buy a golden globe .
so he can only meet with us this morning .
is -- is there any way you could pick lily up from school ?
uh , yeah . yeah , i can .
i &apos;ll -- i @-@ i &apos;ll take her to the park . that &apos;s good .
it &apos;ll get my mind off this meeting with your friend .
i am so nervous .
i haven &apos;t had a sales meeting in ... forever .
i &apos;m a little rusty .
do you remember when we used to call you &quot; little rusty &quot; ?
i was 8,
and i can still cancel this meeting .
fine . i got to go . i got to --
i don &apos;t know what i have to do .
what is this ?
i &apos;m sweating off weight for my wrestling match .
i slept in this .
does this have anything to do with why we &apos;re out of plastic wrap ?
oh , it &apos;s the bottom layer .
and i &apos;ve got some news for you --
it &apos;s not keeping me fresh .
okay . um , you &apos;re gonna be late .
you got to get undressed in the backseat .
ooh , got any pointers for him ?
do you girls have to move that now ?
well , i &apos;ve been lonely .
having a mirror in my room will be like having company !
ugh , your daughter &apos;s a parakeet .
careful .
stop saying that . i think i know what i &apos;m --
oh , one second .
oh , my god .
hello !
no , this is a good time .
haley !
all right . geez !
no , i just got to help my sister out with something .
okay . bye .
okay , let &apos;s just put this down for a second .
oh , my god .
what ?
i don &apos;t think this is gonna fit .
you &apos;ll have to get a smaller mirror .
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
haley , you &apos;ll still be the same size in it .
no !
oh , my god ! we &apos;re trapped !
well , it -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not such a huge disaster .
you know , you &apos;ll just be a little late for school .
make up your mind ! which is it ? !
oh , my god . i &apos;m missing a text .
just got real , didn &apos;t it ?
who sent you ? !
come on . we have to go . we can &apos;t be late .
i am so excited . aren &apos;t you ?
oh , no .
what ? what &apos;s happening ?
how are you ruining this ?
there &apos;s a report of lice in lily &apos;s class .
ugh . it &apos;s probably from portia .
you know , she is always so filthy .
they had to kick her out of swim buddies
because she left a ring around the pool .
we should probably cancel our meeting
and pick lily up ourselves , huh ?
probably ? we have to !
we can &apos;t risk infecting claire
just so we can keep a meeting
with the top wedding photographer in the state .
no . no .
i am calling her .
yeah , it &apos;s the right thing to do ...
... even though it &apos;s like a 1 % chance
of her actually catching anything
and a 100 % chance of us freaking her out .
well , now , wait .
are we being selfish here , cam ?
maybe . go on .
well , if-- if we alarm her just so
that we can have a clear conscience ,
doesn &apos;t that make us ...
monsters .
... monsters .
wouldn &apos;t we be doing her a favor
by not telling her and sparing her all that worry ?
second huge favor of the day ,
after you got her a meeting with your client .
mm . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m starting to feel bad about this .
what , because we &apos;re doing so many favors ,
claire will never be able to pay us back ?
thank you .
nope , she does not need the stress , cam .
yep . that &apos;s it . no more favors for claire .
no !
look at us !
two blondes , having fun !
hey , buddy !
my match is coming up .
got any final dad @-@ vice ?
starting to sound natural , right ?
you know what ? just get out there and enjoy yourself .
you showed real character trying a new sport .
no matter what happens , i couldn &apos;t be prouder .
thanks , dad .
you bet . go get &apos; em !
that may be the best part about being a parent .
whatever &apos;s going on in your personal life ,
when your kid &apos;s happy , you &apos;re happy .
a happy kid is like an antidepressant ,
but a natural one ,
not the kind your husband has to find
in your jewelry drawer .
enough said about that !
hey , gil .
oh , whoops ! i &apos;m sorry , man .
i hope i didn &apos;t blind ya .
although you might not want to see what &apos;s next .
our kids are wrestling each other .
are you kidding ?
nope !
there &apos;s my little bra @-@ snapper right there .
he &apos;s a beast , man .
no , uh , yeah , yeah , yeah .
no , i get it .
this is when you try to intimidate me .
no ! no . hey , good luck .
hey , did you ever hear about those
illegal baby @-@ fighting rings they got in the border ?
that &apos;s not a real thing .
yeah , wife and i brought him down there .
won a whole carload of chickens .
see you out there , man .
that never happened !
watch yourself ! watch yourself !
wish me luck .
no need . you worked hard .
i just want you to have fun .
thanks , dad .
also , i &apos;d like to revise
what i said to you in the car about biting .
manny , they have everything here--
the rainforest experience , the hurricane booth ,
discovering the body --
we have that one in colombia , too , but --
but a different kind .
oh , no .
what ?
you don &apos;t hear that ?
it &apos;s my new shoes . they &apos;re squeaking .
then walk softer .
oh , great .
it sounds like the floor &apos;s made of cat toys .
i &apos;m screwed !
why ?
why ? because these kids make fun of everything .
hand them this , it &apos;ll stick with me forever .
that &apos;s what happened to mumbles .
hey , manny , come with us .
let &apos;s go , mumbles .
one time !
let &apos;s go .
just go on without me .
i &apos;m just gonna stand here .
what -- forever ?
what happened to him ?
he didn &apos;t used to be that self @-@ conscious
before high school .
he used to go around in his poncho ,
play the pan flute .
ay , i miss my little old manny .
manny , you care too much about what other people think !
i know that some of the mothers here
want to make fun of me
because of my accent and my bouncy bosom .
but they don &apos;t . you know why ?
because i don &apos;t care . because i walk with confidence .
and so can you . let &apos;s go .
this place sucks so bad .
sure does , giggles .
one time !
okay , she &apos;s not leaving .
you got to lure her away from the staircase .
she &apos;ll trust you .
you &apos;re kind of dressed like an animal trainer .
why do you keep calling it a &quot; she &quot; ?
well , because &quot; he &quot; s don &apos;t look at me like that .
my god , is she gonna sleep all day long ?
okay , that , coming from you ?
the possum &apos;s actually laughing .
and , besides , i mean , it &apos;s obviously not sleeping .
what else would she be doing ?
playing ... ?
playing ... what ?
oh , my god !
playing possum , the one thing
that absolutely everyone knows possums do .
ha , ha ! i got you !
i was playing possum on you by pretending --
yeah , no , no , no , no , no . don &apos;t even .
no , my god .
mom &apos;s not even here until 5 : 00 .
and you ate our only power bar .
well , that &apos;s probably what attracted it !
you know , we got to throw something at it .
fine .
are you crazy ? !
mr. perlowe will be right with you .
thank you .
thank you .
i was so nervous before , but i think i really got this .
oh , no !
what ? what &apos;s happening ?
how are you ruining this ?
why does everybody say that ?
the -- the director of photography
we met with this morning --he &apos;s turning us down .
why ?
&quot; creative differences . &quot;
he suggested one of us wear a hidden camera
in our boutonniere .
he called it &quot; groom with a view . &quot;
somebody got it into his head to call it the &quot; cam @-@ cam . &quot;
then there was a lot of foot @-@ stomping
and cane @-@ snapping and monocle @-@ smashing .
who is your wedding photographer -- mr. peanut ?
it &apos;s a director of --
it &apos;s a wedding .
sorry i &apos;m late .
jim perlowe ,
this is my sister , claire dunphy .
hi . a pleasure to meet you .
listen , i went by the construction site this morning ,
and those condos are gonna be fantastic --
assuming , of course , you get the right closets and blinds .
of cour-- appears the meeting has already started , so , okay !
yes , it has ! bye @-@ bye , mitchell !
shall we ?
yes , absolutely ! so ...
hey , sleepy !
long nap today .
claire must &apos;ve really worn you out at the park , huh ?
yeah .
do you want to lie down with me , daddy ?
oh , honey , the day i answer no to that question ...
... is today .
where are you going ?
i got to call daddy .
you should know that it &apos;s not just our low prices
that set us apart .
it &apos;s our level of experience .
you know , i have seen it before
a new guy walks into an irregular @-@ shaped space ,
and he &apos;s just like , &quot; ugh ! where do we even start ? &quot;
you start with measurements , maybe .
hey , cam , what &apos;s up ?
well , it &apos;s official . someone has lice .
daddy , hug me !
i would , but remember , the carpet &apos;s hot lava !
yeah , hot lava !
oh , my god . are you sure ?
i think so .
her head sounds like pop rocks .
you have to warn claire .
daddy , this game is mean .
well , you know what , sweetie ?
all right . no . j @-@ just stay calm .
first of all ,
if there &apos;s anything that you need from me ,
anything at all ,
i will be living at the embassy suites .
secondly , there &apos;s -- there &apos;s no guarantee
that she has it .
i mean , i &apos;m with her right now .
i think i &apos;d know .
yeah , i think i know .
so , as you can see , all of them are modules ,
so they can be customized for each unit -- mitchell !
hey ! hi !
so , claire , i need to talk to you .
yeah , right -- right when we &apos;re done .
just after the meeting .
we got pine , cedar ...
it &apos;s kind of important .
a @-@ actually , i got to take this call .
excuse me .
okay .
what is going on with you ?
okay , so , you know how you &apos;ve been scratching your head ?
oh , god . is it that noticeable ?
i @-@ i have some kind of nervous tic .
yeah , there might be one of those in there , too .
um , so , lily brought home lice from school .
what ?
yeah , and , actually , i would &apos;ve told you ,
but cam thought that maybe --
you let me walk around
with insects gnawing on my skull ,
and you said nothing ?
yeah , but , claire --
come here , little rusty .
no , listen , you --
what kind of monster puts their self @-@ interest
ahead of telling another human being
that they are going to get a parasite infestation ?
i feel you would &apos;ve done the same thing .
never .
no , claire , stop it !
uh , i got to get off to another meeting .
but , claire , let &apos;s just cut to the chase .
you got my business .
oh , super !
oh , i think we &apos;re way past handshakes , huh ?
manny , stop disrespecting your ancestors .
it took them 6.1 / 2 million years to walk upright !
didn &apos;t you hear the tour guy ?
&quot; duh . &quot;
no , don &apos;t give me that attitude .
no , i -- why is your face red ?
what ?
it must be my allergy medication .
i must be overreacting to it !
um , i &apos;ll get you some water .
there &apos;s a fountain right over there .
manny , where have you been all day ?
i was in the bird wing .
hilarious they call it that , no ?
where &apos;s your mom ?
she was just there .
i think she &apos;s hiding .
she probably saw she and i were wearing the same outfit
and didn &apos;t want to get outdone ... as usual .
uh yeah , maybe .
but the important thing
is that i have fun out there , right ?
okay , let &apos;s go over this again ,
&apos;cause i feel like you &apos;re not listening .
i need you to win .
hey , jay .
hey , luke .
don &apos;t let your dad get in your head .
get out there and do your best .
all right .
what the hell was that ?
he &apos;s wrestling gil thorpe &apos;s kid .
i hate that guy .
always trying to make me feel like less of a man .
the guy that took your necklace , right ?
my medallion !
call it what you want .
i &apos;m just glad i don &apos;t have to help you with the clasp again .
jay , are you crying ?
no !
referee sprayed some disinfectant on the mats .
i got some in my eye . you got a tissue ?
here you go .
keep it .
it &apos;s my wife &apos;s .
hey , dad !
hey , son !
good to see you .
uh , the match is about to start ... yeah ?
... which means it &apos;s about to finish .
you see that little petunia he &apos;s wrestling ?
yes .
you know gil &apos;s dad ?
i know he always sees me at my worst .
i really want this win , phil .
i can taste it , like metal .
me , too . metal .
i don &apos;t know what it is with this guy ,
but no matter what i do ,
i just can &apos;t win with him .
that &apos;s the way i am with his son .
and time warner cable .
it &apos;s emasculating , you know ?
i mean , it &apos;s not a feeling a man should have .
jay , you know what the beginning of &quot; love &quot; is ?
oh , for god &apos;s sake , we &apos;re just talking here .
why do you always have to make everything
bigger than it is ? !
l.o.
hey , phil , listen .
does your pharmacy carry lice shampoo ?
lily got it at school .
ooh , away , scary robot !
away !
i can &apos;t breathe .
well , good . neither can your hair pets .
what ?
nothing .
lily got lice from someone .
portia .
who else ?
you know what ? skip the pharmacy .
just -- just borrow our lice kit .
it &apos;s in the basement . the key &apos;s under the mat .
thank you , phil . thanks .
all right !
enough .. with scary robot !
but who wants to pretend to be a dog and ride in the car ?
i do !
okay ! meet you at the door !
and remember --
we &apos;re gonna keep our head outside the window .
fun !
yeah , fun ! uh @-@ huh !
fun .
all right , the match is starting .
i feel that metal now in my mouth ,
like you were saying .
what if he loses ?
then we hide our disappointment .
follow my lead . i &apos;ve been doing it for years .
the kid needs to know we support him no matter what .
come on , luke !
luke !
all right . they &apos;re gone .
okay . let &apos;s get out of here .
stay close .
mom , you &apos;re unbelievable .
ay , that &apos;s sweet , but i know i look terrible .
you come down on me for being self @-@ conscious ,
then you run and hide because your face is red .
you &apos;re right .
i keep blaming the high @-@ school boys
for making you self @-@ conscious ,
and you &apos;re taking after me .
we can assign blame when we &apos;re safely
behind our tinted windows .
we &apos;re trapped !
no .
when i was in the caveman exhibit ,
i discovered fire exits .
i &apos;ll explain to you why that &apos;s funny in the car .
follow me .
no , manny .
it &apos;s time for me to set a good example for you .
okay .
mom , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna show you that it &apos;s not important
what other people think .
what is important is that you stay true to yourself .
it was the bravest thing my mom had ever done .
hey , everybody !
uh , hear my squeaky shoes ?
pretty funny , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s right , it &apos;s me -- ol &apos; squeaky shoes .
crazy !
get a load of that pink shirt .
aww , it &apos;s so pretty .
hey , manny , nice top .
uh , but my shoes !
what about &apos; em , pink top ?
it was the bravest thing he has ever done .
they call me &quot; pink top . &quot;
my hero .
pink top .
hey ! whoo ! good fight !
we really blew it with luke today .
how could i do that ?
my dad never missed an opportunity to let me know
when i disappointed him , and i do it to my grandkid .
it &apos;s just as much my fault .
i &apos;ve seen what having a disapproving father
has done to my wife .
i should &apos;ve known better .
dang it .
buddy , i know you &apos;re upset .
you &apos;ve got every right .
we made that wrestling match all about our stupid feud .
that was wrong .
forget about those jerks .
we couldn &apos;t be anything but proud of you ,
just like i &apos;m super proud of your mom .
let &apos;s repair this one first .
we just don &apos;t want you to beat yourself up
because you lost .
i &apos;m not .
i just started wrestling .
sure , it would &apos;ve been nice to win , but i tried my best .
i just said &quot; dang it &quot; because i forgot to get a straw .
son of a gun ! he &apos;s actually okay .
i don &apos;t buy it .
why ? what are you talking about ?
no kid lets down his father and grandfather
and is that okay with it .
he &apos;s burying his feelings .
or maybe he &apos;s just raised better than that .
he knows it &apos;s pointless to fight other people &apos;s battles .
it &apos;s all in the dna , phil .
my old man has a problem with somebody ?
trust me
i &apos;m looking for that guy &apos;s kid on the schoolyard .
it &apos;s how men work .
or used to work .
maybe those thuggish pritchett genes
got mixed with more evolved dunphy genes ,
resulting in a more elevated human being .
oh , my god ! he &apos;s attacking him !
hey ! hey ! get off my kid !
hey . hey ! get off my kid !
aah ! you get off of my kid !
hey , hey ! get off my daughter &apos;s husband !
would it kill you to call me your kid , jay ?
oh , my god . he was saving him .
oh . have a good day .
well ... all &apos;s well that ends well .
yeah , yeah . here we go .
grab a seat , son .
move .
coming in .
i think , uh , probably just a regular burger .
i can &apos;t see it anymore . you think it &apos;s gone ?
it could be hiding .
i have an idea .
what are you doing ? !
i &apos;m gonna create a distraction
so that we can make a break for it .
give it a second to warm up .
okay .
it &apos;s back !
oh , my gosh .
it &apos;s so dark down here .
be careful , sweetie .
what is going on down here ? !
all right , i got to admit something right here .
you impressed me today , luke .
that kid started choking .
you didn &apos;t see a rival or ...
... a chance to fight your family &apos;s stupid battles .
you just saw somebody who needed help .
and that makes you the biggest man in this whole car .
you just attacked him , didn &apos;t you ?
he made that choke sign .
i thought he was mocking my wrestling .
let &apos;s go ahead and keep that to ourselves .
yeah .
i &apos;ll get it .
honey , i take back everything i ever said
about this stupid invention .
it has a name
&quot; the real head scratcher , t.m. &quot;
well , come on in .
just want to say i &apos;m sorry , &quot; doofy . &quot;
and yet you &apos;re still call--
what your kid did today was amazing .
no hard feelings , right ?
hey , cam , hold off on that thing for a second .
lily , honey ?
are you kidding me ? it &apos;s all in good fun .
all right . good .
whoa ! who &apos;s this little dumpling ?
only my niece .
if there &apos;s one thing she loves , it &apos;s piggy @-@ back .
no , i don &apos;t .
yep ! hop on up there !
all right !
who &apos;s this man ?
you can call me uncle gil !
uncle gil !
you two look great together !
get in there ! yeah !
i &apos;m telling you , these little buggers love me .
