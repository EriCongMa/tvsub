yeah , how ya doin &apos; ?
h @-@ hey , what ?
oh ! oh , cleats !
homie , what happened ?
uh ... maybe some easy @-@ listening music
will make you feel better about the story .
turn on 89.9 .
like most of my problems , it all started at moe &apos;s ...
all right , so the rules are
every time the news guy says &quot; senator , &quot;
we got to take a drink .
huh . it &apos;ll be nice to let someone else decide
when i drink-- too much pressure .
uh , yeah , channel six tip line ?
i just caught two senators doin &apos; it in the alley .
and me ? i &apos;m just a reliable source .
not &quot; sauce , &quot; &quot; source . &quot;
source ! s @-@ a @-@ u @-@ r @-@ c @-@ e !
we have heard from a very reliable sauce
news involving multiple senators .
i &apos;m going to read a list of senators ,
with possibly more senators to be named later
by other senators , senator abercrombie ,
senator billingsley , senator beaumont ...
hmm ? oh , damn , the plaster &apos;s flaking again .
once intoxicated , we had a great idea .
hey ! swings !
i &apos;m a kid again !
i &apos;ll save you !
oh , the only way out is in !
hey , look at me !
i &apos;m going up a slide !
homer ! homer !
best recess ever !
help me , guys ! guys ?
don &apos;t worry , homer , i &apos;ll call the cops !
i &apos;ll write my senator .
senator !
senator !
oh , am i gonna die on a playground ,
like some uncoordinated child ?
but i did learn something from all this :
the sprinklers in this park come on at 3 : 00 a.m.
hey , thanks for throwing the ball back .
really .
i &apos;ll come back with the fire truck .
i just have to get the kids to school first .
oh , are the kids with you ?
hi , dad .
homer .
hey , guys ! why are you ducked @-@ down like that ?
don &apos;t want to be seen with you when you &apos;re hitting bottom .
at least we hope it &apos;s bottom .
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s bottom , all right .
and that &apos;s why i was tardy today .
and with that tardiness , you have at last crossed
the boundary where i can legally apply physical discipline .
willie , cut me a switch !
what about the one your ma used on you ?
it , uh , broke on my buttocks .
serves you right for eating jam straight out of the jar .
damn it ! that &apos;s not even a swivel chair .
skate , skate as fast as you can .
but i &apos;ll catch you-- i &apos;m the principal man !
that &apos;s the kind of education you &apos;re missing .
oh , no . uphill .
the one place my car can &apos;t go .
uh , would you like a quote ?
uh , yes .
&quot; some cause happiness wherever they go ;
others whenever they go . &quot;
oscar wilde .
uh , p.s. your car is totaled .
whew ! safe .
oh , not totally .
what @-@ what are you doing in here ?
hiding from the cops .
well , i can &apos;t have cops sniffing around here .
some of them might be girls .
can &apos;t i just stay a little ?
i only committed this robbery to help my kid .
see , this is jeremy .
i need to get him braces .
i always thought that if i &apos;d had braces ,
i &apos;d have smiled more .
hey , i bet you have a great smile .
huh ?
ay , caramba !
bart , bart , we &apos;re in whatchamacallit ...
a pursuit !
so why &apos;d you come here ?
i run a respectable tree house .
just wondering if you &apos;ve seen anything .
uh , word is you &apos;ll , uh ... you &apos;ll snitch for candy .
you can &apos;t buy me with a candy bar that has coconut .
then maybe this is more your ... neighborhood .
nice real estate .
you got a deal .
so , what do you know ?
i saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo ...
say he was gonna hide out on top of mount springfield .
mount springfield , eh ?
strap on your crampons , boys !
eddie ! prepare my litter !
lou , you are responsible
for my oxygen , food , water and cleaning !
you have to clean me .
i clean you . yeah .
dude , thank you .
why did you save me ?
we outlaws have to stick together .
outlaw ? you ?
stolen bowling shoes , 3 @-@ d glasses , krusty standee
and this &quot; cage &quot; for my pet .
oh . what do you feed him ?
my a.d.d. meds .
um , listen ,
would you like two tickets to the school musical ?
my son plays the butcher .
in fiddler on the roof .
i &apos;m busy that night .
yeah , lucky you .
are you okay ?
don &apos;t put more in there !
going for the record .
what record ? stupidest death ?
merci beaucoup !
oh , well , you &apos;re very wel ...
that &apos;s french for &quot; hello . &quot;
actually , i think it ...
lucas bortner , competitive eater .
a fat kid with a dream ?
i can &apos;t compete with that .
what does a competitive eater eat ?
all the glamour foods : pizza , boiled eggs , chicken wings
and the big enchilada , which is not enchiladas but hot dogs .
69 hot dogs is the current record .
as the great kobayashi says ,
&quot; detekurutoki itaiyo . &quot;
what does that mean ?
&quot; that &apos;s gonna hurt coming out . &quot;
is kobayashi the number one , um , uh ...
the correct term is &quot; gurgitator . &quot;
i won &apos;t be using the correct term then .
virtually everyone uses his technique : japanesing .
shall i demonstrate ?
um , why don &apos;t i just go sit alone ... oh , you &apos;re doing it .
ready , set ...
japanese !
that &apos;s not going down .
this happens from time to time .
maybe this isn &apos;t the sport for you .
it &apos;s not a sport .
it &apos;s my life .
aw , he &apos;s sweet .
what am i doing ?
he &apos;s just ralph with a dream .
the dream of not ralphing .
but i &apos;m sure i could totally change and fix him .
can i join you for lunch ?
um , sure .
how many whole pizzas would you like ?
um , can i just have a slice ?
interesting technique .
you didn &apos;t tell me you had a playstadium 4 !
it &apos;s the first i &apos;ve seen it .
something &apos;s fishy , bart.
where &apos;s the gift receipt ?
where &apos;s the packet of desiccant that says &quot; do not eat &quot; ?
and , believe me , you shouldn &apos;t .
i have a feeling this playstadium was liberated
from its previous owner and given to me in gratitude .
liberated ?
you mean &quot; stolen &quot; ?
you can &apos;t spell &quot; crime &quot; without &quot; me . &quot;
c @-@ r @-@ i ...
there it is , at the end !
oh , hi . is @-@ is lisa home ?
yes , she is .
and who are you ?
lucas .
it &apos;s pronounced &quot; luca @-@ dollar . &quot;
that &apos;s my competition name .
i &apos;m a competitive eater .
competitive eater ?
did i hear right ? i could be a competitive eater ?
no ! you didn &apos;t hear anything !
yes , i did ! i heard &quot; competitive eater &quot; !
it &apos;s for people who haven &apos;t had heart problems .
then that makes me the jackie robinson of the sport ,
and you are the racist philadelphia manager .
quit comparing me to ben chapman .
i will when you open your mind to change !
so , what should we practice :
um , vienna sausage ;
blueberry pie , short form ;
oatmeal , long course ;
freestyle baked beans ; catfish--
cow brains .
beans , beans !
we &apos;ll do beans .
never saw the pork eat the beans before .
actually , i &apos;m a little surprised lisa likes him .
really !
justin blobber over there
doesn &apos;t remind you of anyone ?
$ 800 to cut me out of that slide ? !
it &apos;s all about the money with those firemen .
women marry their fathers , marge .
so you just might be meeting your future ...
ton @-@ in @-@ law .
god bless us .
you can do better .
my sisters are nuts .
i &apos;m happy being married to homer .
most of the time .
what the ... ?
敏感性咽反射 软臼齿 行动拖延 轻易退出
maybe you &apos;re not cut out for competitive eating .
are you calling me not fat ?
no , i &apos;m just ... i ...
maybe you just haven &apos;t found the right food , huh ?
how &apos; bout ice cream ?
yes !
i will lay some hurt on that cream .
oh , my god ! brain freeze !
oh , my god .
kick me in the head till i pass out .
harder ! i &apos;m still conscious !
you must kick me harder .
okay , honey ,
i made you pork chops just like you like &apos; em .
twenty .
thanks , babe .
sorry you had to drop out of college to feed me full @-@ time .
now give us a kiss .
what the ... ?
another freebie .
better be a 64 gig .
it &apos;s full of lame apps :
bully avoider , nosebook , insta @-@ grandma .
this was stolen from milhouse !
from my backpack .
where puppy goo @-@ goo sleeps .
maybe it &apos;s time to tell me exactly what &apos;s going on .
relax .
listen to the music of this bubble game .
so peaceful .
no ! i won &apos;t let this go !
it &apos;s time you told me how you &apos;ve been getting all this stuff .
i helped snake out of a jam
so he paid me back in stolen stuff .
it was an honorable arrangement .
but i never thought he &apos;d steal from you .
snake , eh ?
i never would &apos;ve suspected
the one criminal in town .
you seem stressed .
you want to suck some squishee ?
sure .
careful .
it &apos;s uncut syrup .
they give it to horses before they race .
jailbird , aka snake .
偷窃犯
that &apos;s his real name .
albert knickerbocker aloysius snake--
has been arrested for a series of thefts
and may be put to death under a controversial new statute .
yeah , we had a law stating
&quot; three strikes and you &apos;re out . &quot;
but i thought it was &quot; you &apos;re out . &quot;
so i let people go .
so now it &apos;s &quot; four balls and you walk .
right to the electric chair . &quot;
it &apos;s , uh , much clearer , kent .
bart , i &apos;m so sorry .
i just wanted to ruin his life , not end it .
you ratted him out ?
he &apos;s got a kid .
a kid ? !
i was crushed when i lost my dad
and all he did was move to the holiday inn .
i can still see him smoking on the balcony .
he looked like he missed something .
maybe me .
so you see , we can &apos;t let jailbird fry .
time for the sleepover detectives .
i didn &apos;t say there &apos;d be a sleepover .
too bad , &apos; cause i &apos;m wearing my pajamas under my clothes .
and my swimsuit under those .
one day it &apos;ll all pay off .
oh ! there &apos;s my magazine .
why , look at this .
&quot; what every father should do for his daughter . &quot;
oh , marge , if you want me to do something , just tell me .
don &apos;t hide behind a magazine .
right . right , right , right . according to judy kleinsmith ,
a professional freelance writer ,
fathers should take their daughters out on little
dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would .
then she &apos;ll expect the same from the men in her future .
wait , let me get this straight :
sit and eat ? that &apos;s my punishment ?
it &apos;s not a punishment .
but you can &apos;t just eat dinner .
you have to be gentlemanly and attentive .
oh , i can fake attentive .
i &apos;ve been watching a football game this whole discussion .
not fake attentive .
real attentive .
okay , okay . i &apos;ll make it fun .
i &apos;ll take her to that crab place .
all the crabs you could smash .
you know lisa &apos;s a vegetarian .
she can smash a salad .
no . homer , you can &apos;t just do the things you want to do .
you have to act like someone you &apos;d want lisa to marry .
if you just act like yourself , she might just ...
oh , you know ... um ...
she might marry someone like me ?
you think that would be bad .
homie , i love you .
but you can be a challenge ,
like doing the daily jumble .
marge , you are comparing me
to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper !
well , i was just trying to ...
oh ... i &apos;m sleeping on
flanders &apos; couch tonight .
ours is crap .
so marge says i gotta ask lisa on a date .
sure you remember how to ask out a girl , homer ?
yeah , you &apos;ve been out of the game a long time there .
guys , lay off homer .
now you quit stalling
and call your daughter like a man .
oh ... it feels weird .
just ask your daughter to have dinner with you .
what is the big deal ?
ah , he &apos;s doing it !
he &apos;s calling a girl .
oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god ...
oh , it &apos;s ringing .
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
hello ?
uh , hello . lisa ?
i know your brother and ...
stupid , stupid , stupid !
calm down , calm down .
she doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s you .
ah ! hide ! hide !
uh , hello ?
oh , sure , lisa , uh , your dad &apos;s right here .
dad ?
did you just call ?
uh , yeah .
hey , listen , your mom thinks
that maybe you and i
should have dinner together sometime .
just the two of us ?
ah , yeah , i knew you &apos;d think it &apos;s dumb .
i &apos;d love that .
see you tonight .
i got a date with my daughter !
yeah , we all been there .
no need to act like you just
invented air conditioning .
so , you see , chief ,
snake wasn &apos;t stealing that stuff out of greed .
he was stealing it to thank me .
plea denied .
warm up the electric chair , lou .
you &apos;re not done yet ?
the instructions are in swedish , chief .

but chief , we got guns , he &apos;s got a little wrench .
it &apos;s cold !
all right .
thanks for coming down , bart.
you won &apos;t need to save me a third time .
you &apos;re going straight ?
if i get caught , it &apos;s suicide by cop .
oh , i don &apos;t like the sound of that .
it means i get you to shoot me , dude .
yeah , still sounds like a lot of paperwork .
hair volumizer ? !
cologne ? !
hello , marjorie .
homie .
you look like an nba coach .
yes , well , it &apos;s a special evening
and i thought it best not to look like a monkey .
don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t embarrass you .
i will put my napkin in my lap ,
i will use the utensils provided for me ,
and if i our food is slow in coming ,
i will &quot; blow my stack &quot; in a manner
befitting the earl of yarborough .
all right , you &apos;ve made your point .
hey , i can &apos;t screw this up
or lisa will get stuck with someone like me .
homie , i don &apos;t have a problem with you .
except your buttons are off one .
actually , this is a collar button , see ?
it goes like this ...
tuh ! is there no end to your fault @-@ finding ?
maggie , help me with this shirt .
so mr. burns never realized
it was maggie who saved the plant ?
nope .

oh , i &apos;m fine .
well , have we decided ?
uh , yeah , help me out here .

oh , uh ... oh ...
vegetarian .
can the red sauce be cow blood ?
we &apos;ll see what we can do .
is that mom ?
homer , can you come with me for a minute ?
marge , please , control your jealousy .
this is your daughter .
we need to have a conversation
in loud whispers .
uh , excuse me , lisa .
a friend from high school .
homie , i felt terrible
when you said i felt stuck with you .
but then i realized :
i am stuck with you .
i couldn &apos;t stop loving you if i tried .
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s all very nice .
but i can &apos;t forget what you said .
i know , homie .
i know you well enough to know
you &apos;re not ready to forgive me yet .
but i also know you well enough
to know that this will work .
where &apos;d you get that dress ?
remember that sewing machine
you say i never use ?
well , i sold it and bought this dress .
wow , that looks just like
the dress you wore on project runway .
shush @-@ shush @-@ shush .

from a local springfield store .
all is forgiven .
