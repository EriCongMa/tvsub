exterior &apos;s well @-@ kept .
yard &apos;s in good shape .
cleaners need to be brought in for full top @-@ to @-@ bottom service .
there &apos;s a strong , musty odor that needs to be investigated .
possible leak .
power in the basement is out .
probably just a breaker .
no visible signs of water damage .
odor is significantly stronger down here ,
where there is a ...
wine room .
approximately 15 by --
hi , there .
tasha ?
she &apos;s okay .
she had a very good surgeon ,
and she came through with flying colors .
i wouldn &apos;t move around too much .
your spleen , kidneys , and liver are bruised .
the baby ?
i &apos;m so sorry , jane .
i &apos;m sure that ...
i don &apos;t ...
yeah .
everyone &apos;s been by --
frankie , tommy , korsak .
and your mom &apos;s been here the whole time .
she just went home to take a shower .
she &apos;s gonna be very upset you woke up when she was gone .
i &apos;ll fake sleeping when i hear her coming .
what is that ?
a baseball bouquet from jack .
they &apos;re all grover verben .
it &apos;s his great @-@ uncle . jack has hundreds of them .
so he didn &apos;t pay $ 500 for the ...
no .
he thought you could give them out
as &quot; thanks for visiting &quot; gifts .
that &apos;s a very ... odd idea .
i know .
you guys are perfect for each other .
dr. isles .
okay , go ahead and take the photographs
and ask a technician to collect the vitals .
i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can .
okay . yes , i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
maura -- - i know what you &apos;re going to say .
i have a job to do .
you have a job to do .
go to the crime scene .
i &apos;ll be fine .
you &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m sure you will .
but that person isn &apos;t gonna be any less dead
if i wait just for a little bit .
a panda needs to consume --
find your true love .
here &apos;s a special important --
hi , sweetheart .
i know you &apos;re faking .
what , did you go to a carnival ?
isn &apos;t it adorable ?
it &apos;s ... big .
it &apos;s a &quot; hug me tight &quot; teddy bear .
i wanted you to have something to hold when i &apos;m not here .
i thought you might be hungry . i made you a sandwich .
white bread and cheese .
it &apos;s what you always wanted
when you stayed home sick from school .
i was thinking more hot wings .
no .
how about a little gin rummy ?
i don &apos;t know , ma .
afraid i &apos;ll beat you ?
you haven &apos;t beaten me since i was in grade school .
yeah , well , i &apos;m gonna take advantage
of your weakened state .
all right .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
yeah ? how do you know that ?
because i &apos;ve been there .
what does that mean ?
i had a miscarriage about a year before you were born .
oh , ma , i never knew that .
i kept it to myself . that &apos;s what we did .
was pop there for you ?
i think it was hard for him to understand how i felt .
how did you feel ?
sad .
devastated .
i was also confused .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t understand
how i could have such a sense of loss
for something that i never really had .
i think you should share how you &apos;re feeling with somebody .
yes .
i just don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready to talk about it yet .
you &apos;ll know when the time is right .
come on . play cards with me .
i &apos;m feeling very lucky .
jane &apos;s doctor said she should be able
to leave the hospital by the end of the week .
how are her spirits ?
well , when i left ,
she made me promise to call her and fill her in on the case .
sounds like she &apos;s already feeling better .
i hope so .
you were right .
this body is beautifully preserved .
i don &apos;t think i said &quot; beautifully . &quot;
i &apos;m pretty sure i compared her to beef jerky .
and this is the perfect environment to preserve it --
cool , dry ,
just like the egyptians created for their mummies .
i never understood why they went to all the trouble .
so their eternal spirits could recognize
their earthly bodies after death .
why couldn &apos;t they just keep it simple and wear funny hats ?
i don &apos;t think simple was their objective .
they went to great lengths for their preparations .
for instance , did you know that the brain was pulled out
through the nasal passages with a special hooked wire ?
no .
kind of wish i didn &apos;t know it now .
well , there are no visible external injuries --
no entrance wounds , blunt @-@ force trauma ,
or blood loss .
no , and nothing we found in the house points to foul play .
makes me wonder if she died of natural causes .
with this much decay ,
how long will it take to make a determination ?
well , it took me five seconds .
this woman didn &apos;t die of natural causes .
she was poisoned .
she looks like i feel after sitting at my desk all day .
maybe you need to get up and stretch more often .
duly noted .
any idea how long she &apos;s been dead ?
well , it &apos;s difficult to say .
more than 2 years , less than 10 .
is that based on the dryness of the corpse ?
no -- the collar of her shirt .
that was a very popular style in the mid @-@ aughts .
huh . who says fashion doesn &apos;t have a place in forensics ?
certainly not me .
you gonna be able to tell what poison was used
with her tissue samples ?
no .
uh , even though the skin was intact ,
the organs inside the body liquefied
and , over time , turned to dust .
so we &apos;re screwed ?
not quite .
the diptera larvae -- the maggots --
they feasted on the victim &apos;s flesh ,
died of the same poison before they morphed into flies .
so you are ... ?
making a maggot milkshake .
i &apos;ve collected the maggots &apos; tissue , casings , and feces ,
so i can extract trace elements of poison .
i hope you didn &apos;t bring that blender from home .
what ? !
i said i hope --
never mind .
this is a nice room .
you can rest , watch baseball on tv ...
... play along with the game shows .
you suck at small talk .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
really -- you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
what kind of brother would i be if i didn &apos;t worry about you ?
oh , janie .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what can i do ?
why don &apos;t you tell me about the case ?
yeah . yeah , okay .
our victim &apos;s name is fran clark ,
38 years old , single female .
cause of death was poisoning .
did you figure out when she died ?
4.1 / 2 years ago .
what ?
one day , she &apos;s using her phone and credit cards .
the next day , she wasn &apos;t .
how did the body stay undetected for that long ?
all of her bills are on autopay ,
her lights are on timers ,
mail went to a p.o. box ,
a gardener takes care of her yard .
she didn &apos;t have anybody that noticed she was missing ?
no friends , family , co @-@ workers ?
no , the neighbors said she kept to herself .
and according to some messages i found
on her answering machine from her stepfather ,
she and her mother were estranged .
i &apos;d love to hear those messages .
i thought you &apos;d say that .
fran , it &apos;s hhoward .
i &apos;m calling again because the cancer &apos;s gotten worse .
you two have to patch things up before it &apos;s too late .
he left her another message after the mother passed away .
fran , your mother died this morning .
the funeral &apos;s on wednesday .
i know you two had trouble , but come and say goodbye .
i don &apos;t want you to regret it later .
any sign that she went ?
i guess we &apos;ll find out . the stepfather &apos;s coming in .
hey . what are you doing back so soon ?
well , i figured out what kind of poison was used ,
and i figured you were dying to know .
it was hemlock .
as in ancient greece ?
well , the way that she died -- alone --
poisoned by something that no one &apos;s used
since socrates killed himself 2,000 years ago ...
you should have korsak ask the stepfather
about fran &apos;s mental health .
i &apos;ll call him .
thanks for keeping me in the loop .
as if we have a choice .
four years , and nobody noticed ?
not that we know of .
poor thing .
so , howard , you say you were married
to fran &apos;s mother for six years .
yeah .
what were she and her mother fighting about ?
my wife never really wanted to talk about it .
i &apos;m not sure i know anything that &apos;s gonna be helpful .
look , we need to figure out what happened to fran .
and although it &apos;s not what we would have wanted for her ,
it &apos;s better to know the truth .
are you sure there &apos;s nothing you can tell me ?
well , i hate to say this , especially now ,
but i didn &apos;t like her .
she was mean , difficult . she broke her mother &apos;s heart .
i tried to bring them back together
when my wife was on her deathbed ,
but after she passed away ,
i never wanted to see fran again .
i can understand that .
frankly , i &apos;m not surprised she died .
she never went outside , never got any exercise ,
survived on frozen food , candy bars , red wine .
what about friends ?
none that i knew of .
how about work ?
on several financial filings ,
she listed her occupation as &quot; freelance contractor . &quot;
she wrote computer code for banks ,
but she never went to the office .
man .
when you start talking about all this , this is so sad .
i bet there &apos;s not one person who misses her .
do you think she was capable of taking her own life ?
maybe .
i hope not .
may i help you ?
uh , can i have tasha williams &apos; room number , please ?
are you family ?
not exactly .
then i &apos;m sorry . since tasha &apos;s underage ,
i can &apos;t give out her room number .
okay .
well , um , she &apos;s a witness in a homicide investigation ,
so i need to know her room number
and everything related to her care .
really ?
everything that detective rizzoli said is true .
though she might have fudged some causal connections .
218 .
i &apos;ll give you a few minutes , but then she needs her rest .
thank you .
oh . you like baseball ?
was ted kennedy a liberal ?
here .
grover verben , the lefty lion ?
yeah .
why are you giving this to me ?
just my way of saying thanks .
for what ?
for taking care of tasha .
this is too much .
dr. yates to surgical step down .
dr. yates to surgical step down .
tasha .
um , this is dr. maura isles ,
who you spoke to on the phone .
hello .
what &apos;s that thing ?
that ?
that is a &quot; hug me tight &quot; teddy bear .
you know , in case you get lonely .
i &apos;m not really a hugger .
and that &apos;s not really a bear .
i didn &apos;t want to say anything , but she &apos;s right .
it &apos;s a panda -- ailuropoda melanoleuca .
which literally translates
to &quot; black @-@ and @-@ white cat foot , &quot; not &quot; bear foot &quot; --
more closely related to raccoons than to bears .
yeah , i am afraid not .
a recent national science study of dna concluded
that pandas are actually more closely related
to the spectacled bear of south africa than to raccoons .
maybe .
but their skull and dental structures don &apos;t resemble bears ,
their feet don &apos;t have heel pads ,
and they don &apos;t hibernate .
so if they are bears ,
then they &apos;re all alone on their own little bear island .
so , we &apos;re agreed --
it &apos;s part panda , part bear ,
part raccoon , part cat .
i &apos;m not agreeing to that .
jane , that is ridiculous .
yes , it is -- absolutely ridiculous
that a stuffed animal could be genetically incorrect .
the real reason we &apos;re here
is to tell you that you &apos;re safe .
we got the guy that was after you .
i ... wasn &apos;t really worried .
i &apos;m sorry , ladies , but visiting time is over .
that wasn &apos;t a few minutes .
our patient needs her rest .
see you later .
jane .
yeah ?
thank you for helping me .
you &apos;re welcome .
frankie , what do you got ?
we went back and combed through all the victim &apos;s
autopay accounts and found something strange .
fran &apos;s gardener , joe martin , got a pay raise .
six months after fran died .
according to the bank , it was entered
from her regular i.p. address , using her password .
hemlock is a plant @-@ based poison .
and who knows more about plants than a gardener ?
we found your fingerprints on fran &apos;s computer .
you gave yourself a raise .
anything else you helped yourself to ?
okay , look , i knew she was dead ,
but i didn &apos;t kill her .
you knew she was dead ?
yes . i @-@ i found her that way in the basement .
when ?
uh , four years ago @-@ ish .
i went in to turn the sprinklers off for the winter ,
and there she was .
she didn &apos;t look exactly like that ,
but she was definitely dead .
so you just forgot to tell someone about it ?
i should have , but i was low on cash ,
so i just figured that i &apos;d wait
for the next autopay money to go through .
then one thing led to another , and ... i didn &apos;t .
so you could keep collecting the payments ?
i figured somebody else would find her .
and since she was dead , you thought
you &apos;d just help yourself to her bank accounts ?
no .
look ... a few months after i found fran ,
my girlfriend kicked me out .
so i moved into the room above the garage .
a @-@ and occasionally , i &apos;d go into the house .
and her password was right there by her computer .
so i gave myself a raise because i deserved it .
i &apos;d been doing lots of extra work around the house --
you know , since she couldn &apos;t .
unbelievable .
if you think i killed her for the money ,
then why didn &apos;t i take more ?
i had -- i had plenty of time to steal everything .
i liked fran .
she was nice to me .
did you see anyone else at the house before she died ?
well , there -- there was this one guy
i saw a couple of times .
he &apos;s a skinny white dude with a beard .
so , can i go now ?
no .
we &apos;re gonna leave you here and see if somebody finds you .
detective rizzoli ,
this is cathy graff , tasha &apos;s social worker .
i informed her you needed to be kept in the loop ,
uh , since tasha is a witness in one of your cases .
yes , um ...
we -- we just need to know what social services &apos; plan are
so bpd can maintain contact with her .
well , we always like to place children with a family ,
but because of tasha &apos;s age and years on the street ,
adoptive parents and foster families
will be suspicious of drugs ,
prostitution , emotional difficulties .
well -- well , she doesn &apos;t have those problems .
still , potential guardians may be suspicious .
well , uh , you could spend five minutes with her ,
and you know she &apos;s a good kid .
that may be true , but this is a complex situation .
there is nothing complex about it . it &apos;s very simple .
this is a girl who needs love , guidance , and rules .
i have a girl just like tasha
who is a thriving college freshman .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s right .
i &apos;m just telling you it &apos;s the reality of the system .
the likelihood is that tasha will be placed
in a group home with girls of a similar age .
that sucks .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll call you when we have a placement .
how long is tasha supposed to stay in the hospital ?
a week -- 10 days tops .
thank you .
hey , korsak .
i talked to several of the gardener &apos;s customers .
they said he was honest , reliable ,
trustworthy , heck of a good guy .
i &apos;ve been through all of fran &apos;s bank records .
nothing else is missing .
all he took was the extra $ 25 a month .
well , with the password ,
he could have cleaned out her accounts .
okay , so maybe he didn &apos;t kill her ,
but not telling anyone she was dead
probably disqualifies him from the &quot; heck of a good guy &quot; award .
i tested the wine residue on the glass
that we found next to the victim .
&quot; the wine that evaporated from that glass
&quot; was a cheap domestic table wine
without a trace of hemlock in it . &quot;
how &apos;s that possible ?
the killer could have put poison in her glass ,
then poured it out when she was dead ,
then cleaned the glass and replaced the good wine
with a cheap one he brought with him .
there were 500 bottles of wine in that cellar .
why bring a cheap bottle
when you could just open one that was already there ?
wine collectors often keep lists of their inventory online .
perhaps the killer was concerned
that the bottle would be noticed as missing .
well , at least we finally know one thing for sure --
somebody concocted an elaborate scheme
to make it look like fran died of natural causes .
all we have to do is figure out why .
how &apos;s the mutant ?
a bit lumpy ,
anatomically incorrect , and highly flammable .
social services came by today .
i know . she came and talked to me .
i told her i can take care of myself .
yes , you can .
and you have .
but now that someone like me is involved ,
you can &apos;t do it by yourself -- not anymore .
i don &apos;t need your help .
that &apos;s not the point .
look , when you turn 18 , you can do whatever you want .
but until then , we have to find you someplace to live .
no one wants a kid like me .
tasha .
if you think that you can stick me
in some crappy group home , then you &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;ll run away again .
and this time , you won &apos;t find me .
the password we got from the gardener
also worked on fran &apos;s smartphone .
remember what the gardener said ?
that her only friend was a skinny white dude with a beard .
the firewall is for my protection , bill .
it gives me a say in how things are done .
but nothing &apos;s getting done , because you &apos;ve locked me out !
well , i guess now you &apos;ll have to listen to me .
listen , you little bitch ,
if you don &apos;t take that damn firewall down ,
i &apos;ll kill you .
don &apos;t push me .
the only thing the gardener got wrong about this guy
was that they were friends .
if you don &apos;t take that damn firewall down i &apos;ll kill you .
i didn &apos;t mean kill kill her .
what kind of kill did you mean ?
you know , the funny kind .
i &apos;m not laughing .
look , fran and i worked together at the bank .
she wrote code . i had an idea for an app .
we got into an argument .
she locked me out of the program .
i @-@ i got pissed . that &apos;s all you see there .
look , i found her like that . i had nothing to do with it .
you found her ?
what ? no . uh ...
frankie , we should just let this guy keep talking .
he &apos;s doing a fine job of hanging himself .
bill .
we now have a recording of you saying &quot; i found her , &quot;
which puts you on the scene .
her financial stake in the app gives you motive .
and the nuance of &quot; i didn &apos;t do it &quot;
is something a jury might not care about .
after the fight on the video ,
i knew that we couldn &apos;t work together .
so i offered her some royalty payments
in exchange for notes on code .
it actually worked for a few weeks .
then she stopped sending me notes .
so you went to her house ?
well , not at first , but after four months ,
i started to think that she was mad at me ,
that -- that she might sue me for breach of contract .
that &apos;s when i went by .
and found a dead woman in her basement .
did it dawn on you to call someone ?
i did .
who ?
i made an anonymous phone call to the police .
and ?
nothing happened .
so you figured , if no one knew she was dead ,
no one would know that you owed her money ?
yes .
why did it take you four months to check in ?
i thought fran was busy doing other things .
and it &apos;s not like she needed my money .
what do you mean ?
she had money -- a lot of it .
her inheritance .
that guy was telling the truth about the welfare call .
police got an anonymous call , went by the house to check .
everything looked fine . no one answered the door .
well , hard for a mummy to run to the door .
how about the inheritance ?
fran &apos;s mom had less than $ 90,000 in net assets when she died .
she gave it to the stepdad .
but fran &apos;s father died seven years ago .
there are no court records of a will ,
and his lawyer is dead ,
but he had almost a million dollars in property
at the time of his death .
no other relatives ?
none that i &apos;ve found .
well , that money had to go somewhere .
we can &apos;t find any sign that it went through fran &apos;s accounts .
what &apos;d she do -- turn her dad &apos;s estate
into &quot; die hard &quot; bearer bonds and hide them in the mattress ?
and we need to dig into her background ,
starting from when her father died .
somebody knew she &apos;d gotten a pot of gold .
we have to figure out who it is .
how are you feeling today ?
well , i &apos;ve beaten my mother 30 consecutive times ,
so ... pretty good .
yeah . she &apos;s cheating . i just don &apos;t know how .
well , i spoke to your doctor ,
and he says you &apos;re being a very good patient .
yeah .
i &apos;m hoping for early parole based on good behavior .
gin .
have you checked under her pillow for a secret deck ?
whose side are you on ?
mine .
rizzoli .
what ?
okay .
i &apos;ll be right there .
you &apos;re supposed to stay in bed !
jane , your mother is right .
you cannot be getting out of bed .
ple-- jane .
jane , where are you going ?
fran bought a plane ticket
two months after her father &apos;s death .
plenty of time to get control of her inheritance .
where was she headed ?
the caymans . she stayed 24 hours .
if you &apos;re on vacation , you stay longer than that .
it &apos;s a stop @-@ and @-@ drop .
yeah . and i found the hotel .
the room was comped by the grand cayman national bank .
how are we gonna get a subpoena for an offshore bank ?
got to get a federal judge and some evidence
of a violation of international banking law .
it &apos;s not gonna be easy .
is it still wire fraud if you don &apos;t actually send the money ?
thank you for calling grand cayman national bank .
how can i help you ?
i need my account balance ,
but it &apos;s kind of embarrassing --
i &apos;ve forgotten my account number .
what &apos;s the name and the address on the account ?
fran clark . 2020 bingham drive , boston .
your password , please ?
7 , 9 , capital &quot; g , &quot; 2 , 0 , &quot; p , &quot; hashtag , 11 .
at today &apos;s current rate of exchange ,
the balance in that account is $ 878,529.17 .
is there anything else i can do f you , ms. clark ?
no . thank you .
and that &apos;s why you shouldn &apos;t have
the same password for all your accounts .
how long has she been gone ?
i don &apos;t know .
what about the security cameras ?
i &apos;ve got people watching every door ,
and we &apos;ve reviewed the
tapes from every exit since she was last seen .
there &apos;s been no sign of her .
okay , can you check the stairwells ,
unoccupied rooms , and -- and supply closets ?
we &apos;re looking everywhere .
you need to check all the delivery services
and see if they had trucks here at the hospital .
she could have climbed inside one of those .
i &apos;ll get someone on it .
thank you .
korsak is sending patrol units to search around the hospital .
i spooked her .
no , you were trying to help .
same result .
look , there are a lot of people looking for her .
she won &apos;t get far .
should we go back to your room ?
no .
and -- and -- and you got to get back to work .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t .
yeah , you do . go .
okay . i &apos;ll come back tonight ?
okay .
how &apos;d you find me ?
well , it was pretty smart --
knowing that security would be watching the doors .
stay hidden down here until they stopped .
you &apos;re good at your job aren &apos;t you ?
most days .
not today ,
when i came to talk to you about social services .
i need to get a doctor to check you out ,
make sure you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m okay .
that &apos;s not exactly the medical assessment i was hoping for .
look ...
out on the street , i &apos;ve kept my grades up .
if i could just ...
if i could just graduate high school ,
i could get a job ,
maybe go to college .
but if i get stuck in some group home ,
it &apos;ll be impossible .
tasha ...
i &apos;m not gonna let some group home full of girls
screw up your gpa .
i promise .
but i need you to trust me .
please .
i &apos;m not gonna let you down , baby .
i can &apos;t find anyone who knew about the inheritance .
what about the stepfather ?
said he couldn &apos;t help .
he married the mom after fran got the money .
but i called the neighbors ,
trying to find someone who knew her mom back then .
any luck ?
yeah , the lady down the block said
that she and fran &apos;s mom were good friends .
she told me what a wonderful woman she was
and that it was a real shame --
she looked like she was getting better , then died suddenly .
suddenly ? i thought she died of cancer .
well , that &apos;s what we heard .
i called her doctor . he wouldn &apos;t talk to me .
did you have better luck ?
the threat of an official visit
from the medical examiner works every time .
yeah . who wants you sitting in their waiting room , right ?
no . not -- not you .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s the office .
okay . i get it . i get it . - it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s --
so , our victim &apos;s mother had stage iv lung cancer .
when traditional drugs failed ,
she was accepted into a trial for a new a.l.k. inhibitor .
it worked .
she went into remission , and the doctor thought
that she would have a meaningful recovery .
but she didn &apos;t ?
no . she died unexpectedly two weeks later .
was there an autopsy ?
since she was a cancer patient and under a doctor &apos;s care ,
there was no autopsy ,
and her husband had her cremated the next day .
so the stepfather killed the mom , too ?
first , he killed fran ,
thought he &apos;d get all the money when his wife died .
but then her remission meant she wasn &apos;t dying fast enough ,
so he felt like he didn &apos;t have any choice .
well , i don &apos;t know what you were thinking .
if your stitches had opened up , you could have bled to death
before detective rizzoli had found you .
but i didn &apos;t .
by the grace of god .
but since you &apos;ve shown that you clearly don &apos;t have any sense ,
we &apos;re gonna have to keep an eye on you night and day .
careful .
take your meds .
cathy , it &apos;s detective jane rizzoli .
uh , we were talking about tasha williams .
yes , um , i have a question .
what does it take
for a single woman to become a foster parent ?
i guess if you have a reclusive step daughter
and a dying wife , that 800 grand seems like easy pickings .
ah , what are the odds of two people tripping over
the same body and not doing anything about it ?
well , if he hadn &apos;t have killed his wife ,
we might never have known .
the problem is , we can &apos;t prove any of it .
what if we got the wife &apos;s ashes ? would that have forensic value ?
cremation requires temperatures in excess of 1,100 degrees ,
and that destroys dna ,
so even if you could detect some pathogen ,
you wouldn &apos;t be able to say it came from the mother &apos;s body .
we &apos;ll just have to just keep grinding away at it .
we &apos;ll get something , eventually ... hopefully .
that &quot; hopefully &quot; made you sound a little less confident .
can i have pizza ?
yes , when the doctor clears you for solid foods .
i had a sandwich today .
your mother ?
yeah .
well , i hope it was delicious ,
because if it causes a blockage , you will not be happy .
i got it .
a blockage ?
no .
an idea of how to throw a monkey wrench into howard &apos;s plan .
mr. ames .
thanks for coming in .
of course .
we &apos;re done with our investigation ,
and we &apos;ve concluded that fran was poisoned .
there &apos;s no evidence to suggest
that it was at someone else &apos;s hand ,
so ...
we think she committed suicide .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
our investigation is done , but you &apos;ll likely be contacted
by an investigator from grand cayman bank .
the caymans ?
she had an account there .
well , what do they want to talk to me about ?
we can &apos;t officially close our investigation
because we couldn &apos;t find any financial or chemical evidence
that fran was in possession of the poison .
cayman law requires a clear cause of death
before they &apos;ll allow transfer of assets to an estate .
because we can &apos;t provide one ,
their policy is to send in
their own investigator before they deny the transfer .
okay .
i know you and your stepdaughter weren &apos;t close , but ...
... i &apos;m still very sorry for your loss .
so , they released you ?
they did . they sent me home .
but the doctors still have me on a short leash .
and you get released at the end of the week .
yep .
well , you know , there &apos;s still that bit of business
that we need to take care of before i go --
that group @-@ home thing .
i think we &apos;ve found an alternative .
social services has agreed
to allow gwen to be your foster parent ,
and she has graciously agreed to take you in .
i &apos;ve got a daughter who &apos;s in college ,
so i have the room and i have the time .
but there &apos;s gonna be some rules .
rules ?
for starters , you have to be home for dinner by 6 : 00,
unless we &apos;ve agreed to something different .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna go ...
... and let you guys work out the details .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
bye , jane .
homework needs to be done before you surf the net or watch tv .
of course .
and i know that you &apos;re old enough to date ,
but only on the weekends and only if i &apos;ve met them first .
pre @-@ dating interviews ? what is this -- guantanamo ?
it &apos;s gonna be great .
you got greedy , howard .
this isn &apos;t an active crime scene . you can &apos;t be here .
actually , the bank owns the house ,
and they said we could come in .
technically , you &apos;re breaking and entering .
frankie , you mind looking in that bag ?
look at this , korsak .
he &apos;s trying to provide the investigators
with the evidence they need to prove fran &apos;s suicide .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find traces of hemlock in that bag , too ,
which would be okay , if we &apos;d told you what killed her .
read him his rights .
howard ames , you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law .
okay . i put your stuff in a drawer .
thank you .
and i bought you some of that shampoo that you like --
you know , the one with all the fruity @-@ smelling chemicals .
but you said that was like
washing my hair with dry @-@ cleaning solution .
yeah , but it &apos;s like fruity @-@ smelling dry @-@ cleaning solution .
it &apos;s in the green bathroom .
how &apos;s it taste ?
it &apos;s ... cold .
what ? you &apos;re having a beer ?
well , you &apos;re choosing the menu tonight .
i actually like it .
yeah , no . see , that &apos;s how it starts .
i will not be blamed
if you start chugging beers and belching the alphabet .
so , how are you doing ?
how am i supposed to be doing ?
i have no idea .
yeah , me neither .
who &apos;s that ?
probably your family .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m ready for all of them
to pile in here and try to make me feel better .
i just wanted to relax
and feel like everything &apos;s heading back to normal again .
okay . well , i &apos;ll tell them .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll understand .
hail , hail . the gang &apos;s all here .
hey ! hey , janie .
we got pizza now . you can have pizza , right ?
i forgot the key .
the game &apos;s already on , so we &apos;re gonna watch .
look who i found !
come on , get it on . what channel &apos;s it on here ?
it &apos;s 12 . it &apos;s 12 . 4 or 12 .
janie , can you get me an opener ?
someone put lead in your shoes ? no . get it yourself .
should i tell them to go ?
we got anchovies .
you did not .
they look disgusting .
yes !
get in here .
