He's gonna win another 50, 60K.
Let's not go backwards.
These people you run into who wanna be boss? They should know.
I told you. You don't listen, you nut.
You want a coffee?
I don't know...
FBl! Open up!
FBl! Open up!
What is that?
What?
Is this it?
What's going on?
Go back to sleep.
Anthony Soprano, Detective Gaudioso.
I've a warrant for your arrest.
For what?
Are you Anthony Soprano? -Did you bring the whole county?
We don't take chances over an illegal firearm
containing hollow-point ammunition.
What?
Where's the FBl?
Can I see a warrant? We have the right.
Thank God.
Tell them he's got a medical condition.
This is his family doctor right here. Ask him.
Hello, Janice.
Did you talk to Tony about coming up to the lake?
Tony was arrested this morning.
For what?
Weapons charge.
They're booking him in North Caldwell before they take him to Newark.
It's a gun, no big deal.
Hollow-point ammunition, they said.
He'll make bail.
You know he's not wild about the drive.
It's not the time right now.
Well, let him know we're with him.
All right.
If you have hollow-point bullets in anything, take 'em out.
God damn it, AJ,
there is tomato sauce all over these pants.
AJ, I asked for the brown suit from the dry-cleaning bag.
The light didn't go on in your closet. -
Stop it, will you, please?
That show of force,
was that all about humiliating Dad?
Your Honour, the police pulled over some kid
and found a baggie with cocaine residue.
They also found a gun loaded
with hollow-point bullets on the floor.
In order to beat the rap,
this 16-year-old punk claims
he saw my client drop that weapon.
And mind you, not yesterday,
but over two years ago,
using it in the meantime
to shoot at cans and impress his friends.
I gotta tell you, Phil, you look fantastic.
As in science fiction?
No. What? Come on.
Fucking empty compliments. I had major coronary disease.
He's not shitting you.
I broke my fucking guts in Florida on that goddamn recumbent bike.
Would I shit you? You're my favourite turd.
Fucking kid.
Why don't you get a real bike,
have some beach pussy to look at
while you're working the heart?
Go over the handlebars, have some fucking head trauma? That's all I need.
I'm 66 years old.
Anyway, Phil, welcome home.
Thanks.
Don't listen to me.
I'm a cranky fuck lately.
Lately?
Why don't you get a bike, you fat fuck?
Ho! Young and tall and tanned and lovely...
How are you, Doc?
Let me get a drink. I'll be back.
All right.
Glad you're back, Phil. This fucking guy.
How you doing?
I'm here to enjoy my grandchildren,
my home.
Did you hear the news? Pork Chop out in Jersey got pinched
on a weapon charge.
Drops a gat in a field somewhere three fucking years ago.
What the fuck?
Jersey. Fucking farmers, I don't know.
Yeah, he was probably going down on some sheep or some shit.
Gun violence is a blight on Essex County
and Mr Soprano will be
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
You know what that says, Hector?
That's your mommy's name. Blanca.
Blanca. That's Mommy's name.
AJ, can you turn that off, please?
Tony.
Take the yellow ribbons down, everybody. Our boy's come home.
Dad.
Hey. I'm fine.
They let him out already?
What she means is, in our neighbourhood people don't get out right away.
Hello.
Where's Christopher?
I don't know. I thought he was here.
Hold on. It's Bobby.
You want me to come down?
No, nothing a hot shower won't fix.
Carm said you were on the fence about the weekend.
I don't know. Sit around, chew the fat.
We got the meeting with the Canadians.
Tone, with these hassles, you should make it up our way here.
You know, maybe that's not such a bad idea.
Mr Federal Attorney.
What can I do for you?
You had to have your cheap headline.
Are you not aware we've been building a RlCO case
against Tony Soprano for five fucking years?
Then you blow this popcorn fart.
Are you gonna relax?
It's just all this little stuff,
like my phone has one little bar up here.
What if the broker calls?
Caravan for my house is on Tuesday, and the gas is still off.
Mine works.
Hello.
Essex County dropped the charges.
I told you it was a piece-of-shit case.
Two years old, no decent prints.
Santa Claus could have dropped that gun in the snow.
They dropped the charges. Well, I'd say I owe you one,
but I'm sure it's more than one.
Neil, thanks again.
Thank God. I didn't want it hanging over your birthday.
Can we forget already that it's my birthday?
You say that and then you get upset if nobody makes a fuss.
There you are.
I was starting to get worried.
Traffic was horrible.
I've had to pee since Glens Falls.
Well, go.
Hey, sis.
National Lampoon's Vacation.
I gotta admit it,
every time, once you're up here,
it's pretty great.
Aren't you adorable too
with your matching dress just like Mommy's?
It's your favourite uncle.
There she is. It's that little girl,
but I forget her name.
Gladys?
Nica.
No, Murgatroyd.
Nica.
Daddy.
Daddy's girl. Daddy's little girl.
Who's hungry?
You know, a water would be perfect.
Pellegrino?
Sure.
He's gonna pass. He's stuffed.
ShopRite Sparkling?
Sure.
If Frank Sinatra were coming here for his birthday,
would you leave the lawn like that? Looks like shit.
He has enough lawn maintenance
since somebody let the gardener go.
The house wasn't enough?
I'm joking.
You know how grateful we are.
Beer, Tone?
Absolutely.
800 rounds per.
He chromed out the inner carrier.
It's got the Panther fluted barrel.
Is this how you bagged that deer?
I wouldn't use this on a deer.
It's unsportsmanlike.
Like the poor prick's got a chance against a 30-06.
Last two seasons,
I've been using a bow and arrow exclusively.
Get the fuck out of here.
It levels the playing field.
The AR-1.0, that's my birthday present to you.
Thanks, Bobby.
Don't say shit to Carmela.
We almost got a summer place.
Down the shore, remember, Tony?
Any more stuffed mushrooms?
My pop bought this place cos it was close to Canada.
He had ties in Montreal. You know, Tone.
His father, my grandpop,
come into the country through Montreal, illegally.
He wasn't Ellis lsland, your grandfather?
Nah, got mixed up in some shenanigans on the other side,
anti-government or something.
Had a police record.
They oughta build a wall now, though.
I'm telling you. -Amen.
When are the kids back?
Sophia the 7th and Robert the end of the month.
That's nice.
I'm very lucky to be back
with my family after all these years.
Look at you and me, Tony.
Who would have thought we'd have this kind of relationship?
The credit goes to you.
You really changed.
So I had to change?
It's a compliment.
You were fine.
You're different since
that stuff last year,
the shooting.
I'm sure Carm would agree.
I would.
Look, the fish are jumping.
I'm different how? How am I different?
Story you heard.
The pool.
Oh, my God, please.
What?
You don't wanna know.
Pradeep, our pharmacist,
was at a pool party.
All the kids were playing in the water.
The adults were all around, having drinks, barbecuing.
Somehow even with all these people around,
this three-year-old child managed to fall into the pool.
Nobody even noticed till they found him
floating face down in the water.
Brain-dead.
Poor kid's in one of those padded wheelchairs now.
I can't get that story out of my mind.
I don't know why.
Happy birthday.
It's supposed to rain,
so make sure that all the cellar windows are closed.
OK.
Check the one by Dad's wine rack.
OK.
Easy, big fella.
That Jacuzzi's bitchin'.
Who's that?
Fran the waitress. We're really busy down here.
You're at work?
Yes, I'm at the pizzeria.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
The Jacuzzi and the tub's fantastic.
There's everybody.
Don't let us forget to wash the sheets, OK?
Tony seem to hit the hooch a little at lunch today?
I think he's feeling his age.
What do you think it's like for me?
When we were kids,
he'd do whatever I said.
He ate one of Tippy's Milk Bones because I told him it was a cookie.
My therapist Sandy,
she said my Ma was a splitter.
She'd pit us three against each other,
to toughen us up, I guess.
I couldn't help hearing you with AJ.
God, you gotta walk on eggshells with these kids today, huh?
We're almost through that phase, thank God.
You're good with them.
Really? I wish he'd go back to college.
He sleeps most nights at Blanca's.
Speaking of kids and Ma,
Sandy said something interesting,
that when we were babies,
everything was fine,
but Ma couldn't stand that as her babies got older, they separated from her.
When they started to talk and express ideas,
that's when the trouble started.
It wasn't that she didn't love us.
You've been a solid performer for some time now.
Plus, you're my brother-in-law.
You get older, you think about things.
You're a young man. We both are.
World's still in front of us.
Bulls. My estimate historically,
80% of the time it ends up in the can like Johnny Sack
or on the embalming table at Cozarelli's.
Don't even say it.
No risk, no reward.
I mean, yeah, our line of work, it's always out there.
You probably don't hear it when it happens?
Ask your friend in there on the wall.
Listen to us. Morbid fucks.
Come to think of it, you never popped your cherry in that regard, right?
No.
Yet your old man was the fucking Terminator.
I come close.
I done other shit, but no.
It's a big fat pain in the balls.
Especially now with DNA evidence.
My pop never wanted it for me.
He said there were times with the worry
that he wished he could have stayed in the shop,
just cut hair.
To be honest, I'd rather he fucking shot me than cut my hair.
There's somebody I've been bringing along to insulate myself
from the stuff that could bring down a boss,
and take care of Carmela too, in case...
God forbid.
Now, maybe
between me and this person
there's diverging agendas.
Sorry to hear it.
It happens.
Thing is, the Newark facilities manager,
he's gonna fix it so we do all the
window replacements in the projects.
I was thinking maybe you should work that.
I'm honoured to be considered.
Then we'll see what happens after that, long term.
Time for presents.
And grappa?
I told you I didn't want presents, just...
Just a few kind words.
That was my father's line every year.
I get the joke, believe me.
Soprano Home Movies.
I had the Super 8s from when we were kids transferred.
Oh, cool.
It's really very thoughtful.
Thank you.
Look at these. -Look at this.
Tailor-mades.
"To my husband. You're not just a funny, smart, lovable, good-looking guy.
"You're mine."
Thank you, baby.
Happy birthday.
Wait, wait.
To have my health,
to be in this beautiful spot
with people that I love...
I couldn't ask for more.
Six.
Community Chest.
"Pay hospital $100." Fuck me.
What are you doing? It goes in the bank.
We play the Free Parking rule.
What?
Money from Community Chest and Chance goes in the middle.
Whoever lands on Free Parking gets it.
You show me that in the rules.
It isn't in the rules but a lot of people do it.
It adds a new level of excitement.
I don't agree with that.
When we were growing up this is how we played.
The Parker Brothers took time to think this all out.
I think we should respect that.
Fuck the Parker Brothers. Just play the game.
Out of grappa. How about some Rémy?
9, 1.0, 1.1... -Yay!
Fuck.
Marvin Gardens with two houses,
360 simoleons.
Don't throw the money at me. Hand it to me.
I saw that.
Saw what?
You just kiped $500 from the bank.
God damn it, Tony!
I beg your pardon, my sweet little potato.
You asshole.
Free Parking, baby.
This is bullshit.
You take a game of skill and you make it just about luck.
Are you listening to this crybaby?
How about I make up my own fucking rules?
Every time I land on one of my properties,
I get $1.00. How about that?
How about that?
Whose turn is it
my turn?
It was mine. OK.
Here's $1.50.
I want to put a house on Ventnor.
Daddy!
She wants to say good night again.
You gotta go to bed, baby.
Come here, my sweetie.
Yes. So if you go to bed,
you know what?
Mommy will give you a Willy Wonka Laffy Taffy.
Laffy Taffy!
Jan, we talked about this.
You tell me the difference between bribery and positive reinforcement.
That looked like a bribe to me.
You know what, Uncle Tony? Butt the fuck out.
In front of the baby.
They're in the kitchen. Night-night.
I could tape you. Send it to Parents Magazine.
What's that supposed to mean?
When we were kids?
You tape-recorded me and Barb fighting.
You blackmailed us for over a month.
I did no such thing.
Yeah, you did.
You fed him a Milk Bone.
You what?
You want to swap family stories, Tone?
How about the time that Mom and Dad were coming back from the Copa?
That's enough, Janice.
And Ma's hair...
That never even happened. And anyway, it's not for public consumption.
Oh, my God, what?
They're driving back from Manhattan
with Uncle Junior and his goomah.
What was her name, Tony?
Your ass.
That's how we heard the story, through her.
Rosemary. And...anyway,
my father's driving and
she's ragging on his ass. You know how she'd get.
He'd been drinking, I guess.
And he takes out his gun.
Oh, my God.
Boom!
Holy shit.
Fucking blew it
right through her beehive hairdo.
I can't believe you never told me that story.
Yeah, what's the big deal?
Cos it makes us look like a dysfunctional family.
Jesus Christ! -My turn.
Don't tell the kids that about their grandfather.
Of course not.
Did you look at her hair? Was there powder burns?
She had it bobbed the next day.
Play the game.
OK. OK.
Doubles.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Boardwalk. I own it.
You blew guys under it.
I roll again.
OK.
Second prize in a beauty contest.
Collect $1.0.
Go ahead.
Make your stupid joke.
I got nothing to say.
Think I'll buy a railroad.
A German Shepherd's shaved asshole won first prize.
You're talking about my wife.
You married her.
This is my home.
No more talking like that.
It's OK, Bobby.
Stay outta this.
You Sopranos,
you go too far.
All right. You know, Jan, he's right.
I'm sorry.
I crossed the line.
I apologise. It won't happen again.
Income Tax.
Under the boardwalk with his schlong in Jan's mouth...
Tony! Bobby! No, stop!
What are you doing?
Stop that now! You fuck! Tony! Tony! Stop it!
Bobby! What the fuck are you doing? Stop! Stop! Bobby!
Mommy! Mommy!
What do we pay you for? Put her to bed.
Bobby! Tony, are you all right?
Oh, Jesus.
Come on.
Bobby. Stop.
Stop. You are in no condition.
You'll kill yourself!
Fuck!
I'm OK.
My shoulder is killing me.
Jesus fucking Christ, Tony.
Is he all right?
Hold it, everybody.
Look, Tone, I'm really sorry.
Bobby, just shut up.
Let's all just go to bed.
I'll go get some ice.
What the fuck were you thinking?
You're my wife. He insulted you.
I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself.
Oh, God, he is head of the family.
Do you think he's just gonna wake up tomorrow and forget about this?
What the fuck are you doing?
You beat me fair and square.
Come on, let's just...
Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.
How's your shoulder?
Great.
We should have it looked at.
I'm packed. I would like to go.
You were right. You told me to ease up on the drinking.
You should have insisted.
So now it's my fault?
Go wash your face so we can leave.
I hope you're hungry. I made a frittata.
And Ramos fizzes.
Well, thank you, but we think it'd be better if we left.
Not because of last night?
It's for the best.
Come on, we're family.
Jesus, these things happen.
I think we'd all be more comfortable.
We had a little too much to drink,.
but no harm done. The whole thing's already forgotten.
Besides, Tone, we have that thing later. The Canucks.
It's a sin to waste food.
Well, I don't know.
Here. Hair of the dog.
A suicide car bomber
kills two US soldiers west of Baghdad.
Five Americans were killed in Iraq in the past two days.
There are more Iraqi deaths,
29 bodies found scattered around Baghdad...
Fucking look at him out there.
What?
I've seen that sitting in the chair thing.
Come on. People sit in chairs.
That couple from Verona never came back to take a second look at the house.
That couple from Verona never came back to take a second look at the house.
Meadow's staying in this weekend to study.
Paediatricians aren't the highest-paid doctors.
That's radiologists.
But still, what a wonderful thing to be.
If that fucking throw rug hadn't been there,
it would have been Bobby on his back, not me.
What?
I would have kicked his ass.
Jesus Christ, do you think I care?
You don't, huh?
You were there,
that night in the crowd in the parking lot at Pizza World,
when I took Dominic Tedesco.
I didn't know your name
but I remember our eyes met, and you were blown away.
I was in fucking high school.
I should be turned on by you beating up your brother-in-law
at your 47th birthday?
How old is Bobby? 42, 43?
Those four years don't make a difference?
You had it coming.
You get away with murder because you're his boss.
Really?
How about the fact he wouldn't live in that mansion
if it wasn't for me?
I had to sacrifice my entire friendship with Johnny Sack
to get him and Janice that house.
Funny how everybody forgets that.
They are grateful, Tony. Jesus!
You and your sister are emotionally blocked.
I'm old, Carm.
And my body has suffered a trauma
that it will probably never fully recover from,
so why don't we just face the facts?
Yeah?
Hey, T, it's me.
Just wanted to wish you a belated happy birthday.
We had a scare last summer.
Guy down the road was fishing, thought he caught a snakehead.
Thankfully it was only a bowfin.
What's a snakehead?
This ugly fish...
Tell you something, Bobby.
We had this little tussle a year ago
before my injury...
This again?
Tone, I think everyone here knows
you were at a disadvantage.
I don't want to take nothing away from you,
but...
a sucker punch is a sucker punch.
So it wasn't fair and square?
Make up your mind.
I think we both know what's what.
But forget about it. I have.
Come on, Bobby, let's go.
Where are you two going?
Play some golf with some people.
Right.
Why don't you hit a few into the lake?
Bobby, come on.
You OK?
Could turn the air on.
I'm good.
Just I should have taken a leak before we left.
Honey, look at you go!
Mercedes, you didn't say you were taking her in the lake.
I'm watching her.
You're supposed to tell me when you
take her in the lake.
I'm here too.
I don't want Nica going in
the lake without my knowing.
Come on, you've been in there long enough.
Did you hear me? I'm talking to you.
No!
What did you say?
Nica, come over here.
No.
Don't tell me no.
Don't you ever tell me no.
Mad.
You're not mad.
You have no right to feel mad.
I'll give you something to be mad about.
Take her to the house
and put her to bed now.
She's never spoken to me like that.
Probably needs that nap.
That fucking Bobby Jr,
he's going through his adolescence.
He's nothing but lip and attitude.
She's imitating.
She's got that pitch-perfect ear.
I'm a little hyper today.
Maybe it's these oestrogen pills.
If you're as hung over as I am...
That was some story you told, though.
My dad and the gun?
That alone was worth the price of admission.
He was Nabolidan' to his core, boy.
I had this boyfriend once...
One night he hit me.
Boy, oh, boy, I blew my lid.
I completely exploded.
I'm more like my dad.
Than who?
Tony, for example.
So what are you saying? He's more like your mother?
No. Listen,
he's got that temper too.
In the end he went his separate way.
Who?
My boyfriend.
I'm not proud of it, though.
Sounds like he deserved it.
My mother, though,
she could lay out in the weeds for days, years,
waiting to strike.
When you got something in that head
of yours, you give yourself away.
What are you saying about my husband?
What did I say?
I don't know what goes on in your house,
but for your information, Tony has never raised his hand to his children.
Nothing goes on in my house.
Or to me.
Fine.
You know what, I take that back.
Once he slapped AJ
and he felt horrible about it for days.
Bobby took advantage of him last night when Tony had
had too much to drink.
There is no excuse for the way Bobby blindsided him.
Tony is not a vindictive man.
What did I say?
You had a pretty good success with the Lipitor, right?
Well, at this moment we could also sell to you Fosamax.
Medication
for ostéoporose, you know, for the women, their bones.
Now, one month's supply of Fosamax,
four pilules... pills,
sells for $70 US from the pharmacy.
We sell four pills to you for $10 US.
Are they counterfeit?
No.
They're true. They're from Assurance Maladie,
but expirées, like, old.
Change the date, nobody knows.
How much Fosamax can you get?
20,000 pills every three months.
Could we get you to lower your price?
You already make a big profit.
That's a good deal.
We'll give you the first pills in one week, Monday.
What?
I cannot come the week next
because my sister,
she has problems in the court.
She got a good lawyer?
Makes all the difference.
Her old husband, he wants to take their child to Winnipeg
because he's some drummer over there.
Can you believe this? She never see her son.
Separate a child from his mother?
I mean, what kind of person does this?
I would give anything to be, you know, débarrass?of this shit.
To have him gone from her life.
That's tough talk, bon ami.
I'm really serious.
I tell you what,
you knock your price down to 35 grande
and we'll see what we can do about making your sister's problem
go away.
And I'm not talking about a lawyer.
Now, who does this?
You pay to some drug addict?
No, somebody reliable.
We got to talk.
You'll take care of this, right?
Sure.
No bow and arrows, now.
Nice, huh?
How was the game?
You know, he held his own, but...
Must have been the new clubs.
Do you want to eat something?
No, I figure we should hit the road,
beat the traffic.
OK.
You let him win. Smart.
Drive carefully.
Here. Thanks again for my present.
Wait till you see the shots of Aunt Gemma from the '60s.
You forget what a beauty she was before the steroids.
Bobby, you're a wonderful host.
Our pleasure.
When Nica wakes up from her nap, give her a belly smooch from us.
OK. Bye.
He broke your balls about the fight, didn't he?
No, he didn't.
Bobby? Where are you going?
It's business, Jan.
Now?
Yeah.
When are you coming back?
I'm not sure. A couple of days.
The Salernos are coming tomorrow.
Stop fucking nagging me.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yeah?
Some news about this gun charge.
It's not going away.
You said they dropped it.
Essex County did, but now looks like the feds took it over.
Fuck.
What happened to "It's a piece-of-shit case"?
It is. Unwinnable.
But fold it into a RlCO, it adds a predicate.
Good news is if they had what they needed
we'd be having this conversation through glass.
I gotta go.
Bobby, finally! Hey, Bobby.
