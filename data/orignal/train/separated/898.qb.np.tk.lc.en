back in the day , i was a ridiculously cute kid .
yes ! i am literally the coolest man alive !
i &apos;m not bragging . i was it &apos;s just pure fact .
my god , you &apos;re so cute !
i just want to scrumple you up and eat you whole !
but of course , no one stays a kid forever .
yeah .
you sure about this ?
people are gonna know i &apos;m covering up a zit .
don &apos;t worry , pal .
i &apos;ll just tell everyone in school i pummeled your face .
you &apos;re a good brother .
the best .
here , you got a giant one forming on your forehead , too .
maybe i could hide the pimples , but the rest was hard to mask .
let &apos;s go ! hustle !
this is called scooter ball ,
not &quot; sit in the corner and talk to kevin &quot; ball .
i began to smell different .
whoa , goldfarb !
wheel it in !
time for a private huddle !
i &apos;m gonna put this delicately , kid .
you smell like a gym sock &apos;s butt .
uh , thanks .
you smell like a garlic diaper .
thanks ?
you smell like egg salad left in a humidifier .
thanks .
i assume you don &apos;t notice since you live with that stink 24 / 7 .
oh , no , i smell it .
there &apos;s half a speed stick in my desk .
it &apos;s yours now . be liberal with it .
coach is on your team here .
that &apos;s why i pulled you aside to avoid embarrassment .
i guess i wish you would have
pulled me aside just a little farther .
i was eating like an animal and suddenly seeing
every woman i came across in a new light .
you seen my , uh , tv guide
with sally jessy raphael on the cover ?
mnh @-@ mnh , nope .
every woman .
man , oh , man -- those looks
and emotional intelligence to boot ?
but worst of all , it affected my favorite activity
in the world -- the annual school musical .
welcome , mr. goldberg .
i have a feeling that this might be the year
that you finally break out of the chorus .
* i &apos;m watching sis go pitter pat *
* said , i can do that , i can do that *
turns out , i could not do that .
well , you , um -- you really ... really sang it .
you sang it .
i know in past years i was upset when you put me in the chorus .
but i &apos;m thinking this year , it feels right .
done . you &apos;re in the chorus .
oh , thank god .
chorus line , which is a lead !
but i &apos;m in the chorus .
line .
oh , thank god .
which means you have a big solo .
but i &apos;m in the chorus .
line .
but did you not hear the sounds i just made ?
adam , every boy your age sounds like you .
and , honestly , i don &apos;t have that much to work with here ,
so i might as well just give the leads
to the most enthusiastic kids .
balls .
yeah , balls .
okay , uh , let &apos;s take it from the top .
sing it with me .
* i &apos;m watching sis go pitter pat *
try to stay in the key .
* i &apos;m watching sis go pitter pat *
you &apos;re kind of all over the map . okay .
* i &apos;m watching sis go pitter pat *
* i can do that *
you know , it &apos;s mostly a dance show ,
and you bring a lot of dance energy .
you &apos;ll get it . balls .
it was september 30 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my brother and his idiot posse , the jtp ,
were gearing up for the homecoming dance .
what &apos;s happening ? what is this ?
homecoming &apos;s in four days ,
so it &apos;s time to give my boys a crash @-@ course lesson
on how to groove like milli vanilli .
we all kind of told our dates
that we could dance , so thank god for barry .
no . thank god for milli .
vanilli , not so much .
wait , wait . you choose milli over vanilli ?
he &apos;s got the body and the moves .
uh , if he &apos;s so great , then why isn &apos;t it vanilli milli ?
milli proceeds vanilli , so suck it .
you suck it .
you suck it !
wow , even you three boneheads found a date to the dance .
kind of makes you think , huh ?
like maybe you need a date for once ?
what are you talking about ? i date .
no , you third @-@ wheel me and lainey .
look , the only reason why i haven &apos;t been on a date
is because there &apos;s no one at our school worth dating .
well , if you want to go to homecoming with me ,
i &apos;ll totally drop my foxy lady .
your foxy lady &apos;s your cousin .
second @-@ cousin .
totally different blood line .
probably not gonna do stuff , though .
she looks just like me with a perm .
erica , you know i love you , but you &apos;re kind of
closed off and way too picky .
i mean , stay away from geoff , obviously ,
but you got to give someone a chance .
how is it my fault that every guy in our school
is an unbearable moron ? - that &apos;s another thing --
you &apos;ve got to stop calling everyone a moron .
morons ! you &apos;re being too loud !
find another house to stupid up .
oh . my . god .
you &apos;re just like dad !
way to go , mur @-@ man .
years of calling everyone on the planet a moron
has poisoned your daughter &apos;s love life
and left her cold and alone .
so you &apos;re telling me that i &apos;ve raised a daughter
who doesn &apos;t want to date dumbass high @-@ school boys ?
i think i &apos;ve done my job .
come on . let us help you find someone .
go on . describe your perfect guy .
well , he &apos;d be a mysterious handsome outsider
with a trench coat , a sexy voice ,
and a thriving acting career
where he plays the thinking girl &apos;s heartthrob .
dude , you &apos;re just describing christian slater .
seriously ? you &apos;re a lost cause .
well , you asked .
look , if a guy like christian slater walks through that door ,
i promise you i will go with him to homecoming .
christian slater , huh ?
you want the coolest guy in the world . you got him .
what &apos;s that ?
nothing , i just ... farted .
i -- i farted .
i fart-- i got to go .
while geoff was hatching a plan ,
i was out of options .
there &apos;s my tiny snuggle angel .
stop it !
i &apos;m not tiny or snuggly or angel @-@ y .
tough day at the office , kiddo ?
the worst . i got the lead in the musical .
schmoo , that &apos;s fantastic .
that &apos;s all you &apos;ve ever wanted .
not anymore .
my face is breaking out , my pits are stinking ,
and my voice is very , very unpredictable .
i finally get the part of a lifetime ,
and i &apos;m gonna just humiliate myself .
ah , yes , the wondrous journey through puberty .
it &apos;s not wondrous . it &apos;s awful .
well , you &apos;ve come to the right place .
oh , no .
it &apos;s my duty to help you out , baby bro .
only big tasty can guide you
through what many call &quot; the pubening . &quot;
no one calls it that .
first , stop washing your face .
you &apos;ll go through a very shiny , greasy couple of months .
but eventually , your natural oils reach a healthy balance .
why does he do this ?
i don &apos;t know .
second , always shave dry and against the grain ,
attacking the follicles in a jerky , zig @-@ zag pattern .
and third , never use deodorant .
that &apos;s just something that big corporations made up to take your money .
simply apply a healthy layer of vaseline to the armpit
and let it seal in the stink .
he &apos;s still going .
he means well .
think of me as a resource . i &apos;m here for you , bro .
thank you , boopie . so helpful .
forget everything you just heard .
if anyone understands what you &apos;re going through , it &apos;s mama .
no offense , mom , but you have no idea how hard this is for me .
please , i &apos;ve watched two children
go through the pubening .
heck , i even went through it myself at the tender age of 9 .
it wasn &apos;t ideal .
they used to call me &quot; booberly . &quot;
but this is just something all of us
had to suffer through on our own .
now you will , too .
or ... completely skip over .
with my guidance , i &apos;ll take this horrible time
and make it smooth , easy , and maybe a little bit fun .
are you actually saying you could save me from puberty ?
no ! she can &apos;t .
yes , that is exactly what i &apos;m saying .
at this point , i got nothing to lose .
show me what you got , lady .
while i put my faith in my mother ,
geoff schwartz put his in christian slater .
greetings and salutations .
lovely home you got here .
what &apos;s going on ? why are you talking like a jackass ?
erica said she wanted a christian slater , so here i am .
i know it &apos;s a long shot ,
but i just think your daughter &apos;s amazing .
and if you approve , i &apos;d love to take her to homecoming .
erica !
you &apos;ve got a gentleman suitor .
you &apos;re one of the good ones , mr. g.
a gentleman what ?
greetings and salutations .
i was just skateboarding by , gleaming the cube and whatnot .
thought we could go grab a slushie .
oh , my god , are you trying to impress me
by acting like christian slater ?
is it working ?
no .
and your clip @-@ on earring just popped off .
okay , look , i @-@ i just --
i think you &apos;re great , okay ?
i have since , like , second grade .
now , i know i made promises to my cousin ,
but maybe we could go to homecoming together ?
oh , geoff , this was sweet ,
but i have a pretty firm &quot; no moron &quot; policy .
question -- am i in that category ? - for sure .
uh , so , um ... okay , so i &apos;ll put you down for a &quot; maybe . &quot;
god , what a putz . am i right ?
at that moment , my dad realized that perhaps
his judgmental nature may have rubbed off his daughter .
and he decided to do something about it .
wow , who knew so many interesting
and attractive young men went to this school ?
they &apos;re okay , i guess .
yeah , lots of fellas who look like
they &apos;d be worth getting to know .
i should put myself out there more .
oh , look at that one with the stylish scarf
and the sketchbook -- a poet and an artist , i bet .
that &apos;s dan .
he &apos;s shy , but i think i could crack open that nut .
hey , how about that hot shot ?
is he a swimmer ? he &apos;s built like a swimmer .
look at those shoulders . he swims , for sure .
will you shut up ?
i &apos;m not even talking to you .
well , i certainly hope you &apos;re not talking to me .
hey , take it from someone who doesn &apos;t like people .
if you close yourself off , you &apos;re gonna miss out on a lot .
so my dad wants me to date more ?
it &apos;s homecoming !
there &apos;s got to be a nice guy somewhere who deserves a chance .
you &apos;re right !
i &apos;m gonna go ask dan to sit with me at lunch ,
see what makes that guy tick .
thanks , dad .
yes , this is amazing !
your dad actually provided you with real wisdom for once .
chill , i didn &apos;t say i was going to the dance .
i just said i would consider it if an idiot asked me .
got it . we &apos;ll play it cool and casually spread the word .
attention , entire school !
this is erica goldberg , and she will go
to homecoming with anyone willing to ask .
barry , sit your ass down right now .
uh , to clarify , she &apos;s not a desperate loser .
she &apos;s just super closed @-@ off , and the door &apos;s open a crack .
which reminds me , dan , we &apos;re hanging out after school .
i @-@ i have a dentist appointment , bro .
cancel it ! we &apos;re building something here !
get down .
subtle . thank you .
well , the good news is now we can just sit back and wait .
well , don &apos;t hold your breath .
&apos;sup ?
hi .
i &apos;m johnny atkins .
heard you needed a date to homecoming .
sure , i guess .
you ever been out with a first chair
in the school band before ?
no .
well , it &apos;s everything you ever imagined .
i &apos;ll phone you -- saxophone you .
we &apos;re gonna have fun .
dude &apos;s confident , i &apos;ll give him that .
you &apos;ve got a date to the dance .
everybody &apos;s happy , and it all worked out .
what did i miss ?
we met a first chair in the school band .
while erica landed a date ,
i landed a seat at the gimbels makeup counter .
what kind of sorcery is this ?
my giant zits are gone !
mama made you a promise .
now your adorable punim is ready to light up that stage .
just one problem -- my singing voice .
my mom couldn &apos;t fix that .
that is , until some news broke that shook the country .
they &apos;ve become international stars .
but behind the braids and break @-@ dancing ,
it &apos;s been discovered that milli vanilli
neither sang on their albums nor at their concerts .
that &apos;s unreal . they fooled everyone .
yes , they really did .
and maybe you can fool everyone , too .
what are you talking about ?
say that again only just mouth the words .
what are you talking about ?
did that look as good as it felt ?
better !
problem solved , love bug !
we &apos;re gonna milli vanilli the out of that musical .
my dad suggested that erica take a chance on someone .
unfortunately , that someone was this dude .
yo . is erica here ?
yo . she &apos;s upstairs . who are you ?
johnny atkins . yeah .
that johnny atkins .
i &apos;m her dad .
yeah , that dad .
mind if i just head up ?
actually , i do .
zang ! atkins likes .
all right , can i talk to you
in the other room away from this person ?
sure . oh .
who the hell is that ?
it &apos;s my date to the dance on saturday .
he wanted to hang .
that kid &apos;s your date ? he &apos;s a moron .
well , you &apos;re the guy who told me to give the morons a chance .
but i meant other morons .
what other morons ?
nice morons ! morons like that geoff kid .
schwartz ? he &apos;s a moron .
they &apos;re all morons ! that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
but any other moron is better than that moron .
this is ridiculous .
i took your advice ,
but you don &apos;t get to actually choose who i date .
my dad &apos;s plans for erica may have fallen apart .
but my mom &apos;s plan for me only needed
to get past one person for it to succeed .
susan , i really appreciate you agreeing
to see me on such short notice .
technically , i didn &apos;t agree .
you just barged in during third period
and yelled &quot; class dismissed . &quot;
point is , i understand you &apos;re putting together
a cast for this year &apos;s musical ,
and it &apos;s presented some challenges .
it &apos;s a real suck show . uh , you &apos;re gonna be great .
i won &apos;t be , but that &apos;s sweet to say .
well , what if i had a way to solve your problems ,
a way to make this your biggest hit yet ?
mrs. goldberg , we have been through this in the past .
you can &apos;t be in the musical .
no , no , i ... i &apos;ve come to accept that .
i &apos;m talking about a different approach entirely .
have you heard of this milli vanilli scandal ?
big fan . it hit me hard .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
but what if someone could do the same thing
only without making the same sloppy mistakes ?
are you actually suggesting
that adam lip @-@ sync his songs in the show ?
god , i guess hearing it out loud ,
it really does sound insane , even for me .
screw it . i &apos;m in .
really ?
i &apos;ll get all the kids to do it . i mean , what choice do i have ?
none .
mouth it .
hey , johnny .
yo , looking forward to saturday night .
me too .
so i &apos;ll pickp carla first ,
be at your place around 7 : 00 , cool ?
cool .
wait , what ?
yeah , i &apos;m also giving her a ride to the dance .
and she can hang out with us . and dance with us .
are you taking both of us to the dance ?
classic johnny atkins , am i right ?
how could you not see this coming ?
because i have no idea who you are ,
other than an oddly confident band geek .
shows what you know .
band geek in front , rock god in the back .
are you seriously okay with this ?
no , but i really feel like i can fix him .
but she can &apos;t , so what do you say ?
what do you think she says ? hit the bricks , bro .
dude , i will punch you in the eyeball .
erica , help me . he &apos;s serious .
you know what , johnny ?
that &apos;s a firm &quot; no &quot; to your creepy offer .
your loss .
hey , debbie gordon , you got a date to homecoming yet ?
oh , man , that was so sweet of me , huh ?
so if it &apos;s looking like you &apos;re free saturday night , then --
i &apos;m not going to the dance , geoff --
not with anybody .
* i stuff her shoes with extra socks *
* run seven blocks *
* in nothing flat *
* and i can do that *
* i can do that *
this is incredible .
my grandson &apos;s a superstar .
* i &apos;m watching sis go pitter pat *
* said , i can do that *
* that , that , that *
my god , he &apos;s repeating himself .
you can do what ? what can you do ?
finish the thought .
dad , he &apos;s fine . just working out some kinks .
wait , so you actually weren &apos;t doing anything ?
&quot; not doing anything ? &quot; didn &apos;t you see this ?
bevy , you can &apos;t let him go
through with this cockamamie scheme .
well , actually , it was my idea .
oh , god . why ?
pops , i can &apos;t go onstage and completely embarrass myself .
just do your best !
you &apos;re the same great kid you always were .
listen to me . do i sound like the same kid ?
do i look like the same kid ?
no . i &apos;m not him .
i &apos;m ... whatever this is .
and if mom can make it better , i &apos;m gonna let her .
don &apos;t give me that look .
as his mother , it is my job to make this all better .
but you can &apos;t .
all you &apos;re doing is making it worse .
you &apos;re turning him into someone he &apos;s not .
i forgot my foundation , rouge , and powder puff .
good day to you , sir .
the biggest night of my middle @-@ school
theater career had arrived , and the only one
more nervous than me was my smother .
okay , let &apos;s warm up .
i have the recording of the new york city boys choir
doing scales , so show me what you got .
oh , very good , very good . move those lips .
no sounds !
watching us milli vanilli our way
through the warm @-@ up scales ,
my mom realized pops was right .
okay , susan .
we need to talk .
sorry , show starts in five .
no , you can &apos;t do this . it &apos;s wrong , and you know it .
what are you talking about ?
this whole thing was all your idea .
those people out there -- they want to see
&quot; a chorus line , &quot; not &quot; a chorus lie . &quot;
i &apos;m so confused by your moral high ground .
again , this was all you .
mom , it &apos;s fine .
this recording is gonna blow
the freaking roof off this place .
and so are you with your own voices .
yes , they are creaking and cracking .
and , yes , your foreheads are very shiny , all right ?
and you take insanely long showers ,
but it doesn &apos;t matter
because you &apos;re all just as amazing as you always were .
i don &apos;t feel amazing .
you ? what &apos;s your problem ?
oh , you heard my voice .
who cares ?
i got bacne , dude . crazy bacne .
so ? i sweat constantly for no reason .
i @-@ i &apos;m sweating right now , and it &apos;s like 50 degrees in here .
i &apos;ve got a weird thing for sally jessy raphael .
see ? none of you are alone .
you &apos;re all going through something
that everybody has to suffer through .
come on . who &apos;s with me ?
screw it .
let &apos;s go out there and give them
the best worst musical the school has ever seen .
and so we sang it .
we really sang it .
and it wasn &apos;t pretty , but it was definitely us .
* kiss today goodbye *
* the sweetness and the sorrow *
* wish me luck *
* the same to yo @-@ u @-@ u @-@ u @-@ u *
sure , growing up is hard and awkward and embarrassing .
but if you &apos;re lucky , you just might find the courage
to sing your way through it ...
* what i did for love *
... or have someone talk you through it
when you least expect it .
hey , peanut .
i , uh , heard about the kid with the hair .
so , uh , you &apos;re not going to the dance , huh ?
honestly , i hate dances .
and the nice thing about being alone
is that there &apos;s no one here bothering me ,
acting like a moron .
oh , my god , barry &apos;s right .
god , i &apos;m just like you .
sorry .
i get it .
but there &apos;s hope .
why ?
well , things work out .
i met your mom .
she sees the best in everybody , even a grump like me .
all i &apos;m saying is just give people a chance .
don &apos;t be a moron .
&apos;cause as hard as it is to grow up ,
it &apos;s even harder to go through it alone .
and when you open up and put yourself out there ,
you &apos;ll be surprised where it leads .
erica , hi !
greetings and salutations .
you busy ?
uh ... not really .
i was just waiting for my cousin to call back .
i thought maybe we could still make the end of the dance .
well , i was thinking maybe we could hang out instead .
no way .
as friends .
yeah , no .
let &apos;s not put a label on it . let &apos;s --
so , what do you say we go grab a slushie ?
check this out .
gleaming the cube .
what does that even mean ?
no one knows .
oh , my god , geoff , are you okay ?
no , not a new one . it &apos;s photo day at school .
you came to the right place .
no , get out !
i don &apos;t want any of your terrible advice .
dude , i &apos;m a pimple pro .
you got to pop that thing immediately .
everyone says not to pop it .
look at this flawless skin .
it &apos;s like baby italian marble .
would you rather have a pizza face or a barry face ?
fine . i &apos;ll just pop the thing .
oh , i got to get this on film .
come on .
let &apos;s get a close @-@ up of that zit .
hey , why are you covering it ?
don &apos;t feel so embarrassed .
let me see that zit . come on -- for memories .
let &apos;s get a close @-@ up of that zit .
he &apos;s covering his mouth
&apos;cause he doesn &apos;t want anyone to see his zit .
