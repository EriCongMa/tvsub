i &apos;m emma , by the way .
lily .
while your precious robin
thinks it &apos;s his wide @-@ eyed wife ,
it &apos;s actually me .
one phone call from me ,
and your beloved dies at the hands of your sister .
now forget all this and run along home .
so i &apos;m headed to new york now .
and if you breathe one word of this to zelena ,
i take this heart and squeeze .
cruella can &apos;t kill anyone .
emma doesn &apos;t know .
which means gold wants her to ...
what brings you here ?
the author --
he has violated the rules .
he has changed things .
the savior --
he made me channel her potential for darkness
into maleficent &apos;s child .
there must be a way to undo it .
i &apos;m afraid not .
what &apos;s done is done , my apprentice .
but what now of the girls , their fates ?
remain entwined ,
as they always were and always shall be .
of course .
our concern now is the author .
i have taken care of that , master .
our mistake has been rectified .
he is in the book ,
where he can no longer alter our world --
only record what happens .
you must see to it there is no more damage .
the author must never be allowed to toy with fate again .
i &apos;ll miss her .
furs and all , i &apos;ll miss her .
she was good to me -- in her way .
made me who i am .
well , someone had to die at the savior &apos;s hands .
did they ?
we won &apos;t have what we need to rewrite the book ,
to secure our happy endings ,
until ms. swan has completed her journey .
the savior has taken the first step down a dark path .
and we have to make sure she stays on it --
for both our sakes .
i &apos;m going after gold .
he made this happen . he needs to answer for it .
careful . don &apos;t go off half @-@ cocked .
hook &apos;s right . he wants you angry .
yeah , well , i am angry .
that doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s gonna get what he &apos;s after .
do i wish i could change what i did to cruella ? yes .
but that &apos;s regret , not darkness .
i think we &apos;ve all done things we regret .
right now , we need to focus on one thing --
how to keep gold and the author
from causing any more damage .
i might be able to help with that .
it now appears we have a common foe --
rumplestiltskin .
he resurrected you .
to help himself , not me .
cruella &apos;s death only confirmed that .
now you want to turn on him before he turns on you .
i knew gold couldn &apos;t keep the dragon on her leash for long .
what do you want ?
nothing from you .
but your daughter ,
i hear , has a talent for finding people .
yeah , i do .
who do you want found ?
my daughter .
she &apos;s alive ?
yes .
she survived the journey to this land --
the journey you sent her on .
you want to prevent rumplestiltskin
from achieving whatever he wants .
what better way than leaving this town and helping me ?
i &apos;m not running away from gold .
it &apos;s not running from him . it &apos;s hindering him .
what do you know about her ?
just what the dark one showed me --
that she was banished to this world 30 years ago
to a place called minnesota ,
where she was adopted by a couple .
and they named her lilith .
no .
emma ? what is it ?
lily .
mom said i could have it !
flashlight ...
no , she didn &apos;t !
batteries ...
canteen ...
i want it !
i want it , too !
... matches ... - both of you -- stop it !
how &apos;s the checklist going , em ?
good , i think .
uh , what &apos;s &quot; g.o.r.p. &quot; ?
&quot; good old raisins and peanuts . &quot; it &apos;s trail mix .
haven &apos;t you ever been camping before ?
i &apos;ve never even been on a vacation before .
not everyone was lucky enough
to grow up the way that you and your brother have .
emma , we &apos;re just happy
that you &apos;re gonna spend your first family vacation with us .
so am i.
oh . i almost forgot -- sleeping bag .
emma , wait .
lily ?
what are you doing here ?
i know i &apos;m probably the last person you want to see right now .
but i ... didn &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
what &apos;s wrong ? what happened ?
it &apos;s bad , emma .
i know i &apos;ve lied to you before ,
but i really need your help .
why should i trust you now ?
because i am in big trouble .
you once said we &apos;d be friends forever .
did you mean it ?
&apos;cause i did .
emma ?
who &apos;s this ?
this is ... lily .
my friend .
you never told me that you had friends in the neighborhood .
my foster family just moved here .
i thought i would surprise her .
well , lily , would you like to join us for dinner ?
ain &apos;t fate a bitch ?
you know this girl .
how ?
she was my friend .
oh , the one you told me about .
who you said you pushed away ?
how is this possible ?
of all the kids in the world ,
the one i end up friends with is the one my parents banished ?
emma , there are powers beyond our understanding ,
and your parents messed with them .
so the only friend i ever had
wasn &apos;t even my friend by choice .
i know .
it hurts , doesn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;ve been there , too .
yeah ?
you think it was a coincidence
that i just so happened to adopt the savior &apos;s son ?
our actions are our own , but fate pushes us .
maybe it &apos;s time to push back .
how ?
well , i have to go to new york
to rescue robin from my insane sister ,
and you have to find this girl to redeem your parents
and show gold he &apos;s wrong about you --
that he can &apos;t change you .
what do you say we help each other ?
what , like a road trip ?
well , if that &apos;s what you want to call it .
i &apos;m okay , regina . i don &apos;t need a babysitter .
but maybe i need you . you lived in new york .
i &apos;ve barely been outside of storybrooke .
how about it , swan ?
how about we make today the day we both beat fate ?
you &apos;re letting them leave town ?
for our purposes ,
where the savior turns dark is of little consequence .
i &apos;m confident her latest mission
will darken her heart faster than we ever could .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
there &apos;s something i need to take care of .
be good , kid .
i &apos;ll see you when i get back .
be careful , swan .
as someone who started on the side of good and went dark ,
take my advice -- vengeance is tempting .
the darkness always is .
resist it .
why couldn &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t have anything to live for .
you have your parents , henry ...
you .
aye -- me .
and i , you . that &apos;s what &apos;s kept me on my path now .
use whatever it takes to stay on yours .
emma -- - take care of henry .
of course .
did you get what you needed ?
i &apos;m not going into a land without magic
without bringing some of our own .
the snow queen &apos;s scroll -- in case we have any trouble
getting through the cloak put around this town .
sounds good . let &apos;s get out of here .
what is it ? something on lily ?
yeah . one of my contacts found an address .
but it &apos;s five years old .
emma , what is it ?
this is in lowell , massachusetts ,
which is less than 30 miles outside of boston ,
which is where i lived five years ago .
lily and i grew up in minnesota , separated as kids ,
and ended up living less than an hour apart as adults ?
like i said -- fate .
you &apos;re connected . it &apos;s been pushing you together .
it may have been pushing us together as kids , but ...
last time i saw her , i &apos;m the one who pushed her away .
what exactly happened between you two ?
we are thankful lily could join us to be our guest ,
and let these gifts to us be blessed .
amen .
amen .
amen .
sorry about the takeout , but with all the packing ...
hey , i love it .
the whole vibe .
homework , chore wheel , house rules .
like norman rockwell blew up in this place .
emma seems really lucky to have ended up with you guys .
well , we are lucky to have emma in our family .
what &apos;s that ?
max . that &apos;s not polite .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just a birthmark .
so , lily , tell us , how did you and emma meet ?
it was a group home ?
uh ... yeah -- back in falcon heights .
we hit it right off . best friends forever .
it &apos;s a shame you two were split up .
yeah .
emma was the first person who ever really understood me , you know ?
like we were meant to come into each other &apos;s lives .
can , uh , we get seconds ?
max , can you pass me the gravy , please ?
what are you doing ?
making a good impression .
by lying to my foster parents about how we met ?
would you rather i told them the truth --
that you were shoplifting pop @-@ tarts
and i was giving you tips ?
i was hungry and -- i mean , that &apos;s not the point .
i &apos;m finally in a good situation .
i don &apos;t want to mess it up .
yeah . no , it &apos;s nice here .
in skyline , a local tom thumb robbed by two armed assailants
is the subject of an intense police investigation .
both suspects had their faces obscured by masks .
if you have any information ,
please call the mankato we @-@ tip hotline .
i can explain .
why did i go through the trouble of creating storybrooke
when i could have cursed everyone to live here ?
yeah ?
sorry to disturb you .
we &apos;re just looking for lilith page .
is she around ?
no , she ain &apos;t around .
not for years .
you know where she moved ?
lady , she ain &apos;t moving nowhere . she &apos;s dead .
what ?
car wreck a couple years back .
pretty sure she was drunk .
not that anyone missed her .
i mean , she was a weird one . kept to herself .
&apos;course , she had one of those personalities
that you wanted to stay far away from .
a real loser .
she was my friend !
emma ! emma !
emma . it &apos;s not worth it .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m absolutely fine .
so , uh , you sure you don &apos;t mind ?
david and mary margaret
just need me to watch the baby for a bit .
bye .
when you walk into a man &apos;s home ...
... you should ask if you &apos;ve been invited .
if you &apos;ve come here to hurt me , you best get on with it .
but i warn you -- i &apos;m scrappy .
all right , scrappy .
believe it or not , you may be of some use to me .
you &apos;re a thief , and i need something stolen .
and what might that be ?
belle &apos;s heart .
already in the process of doing that .
sorry , mate .
as close as you think you have grown to my wife ,
you &apos;re clearly not close enough to realize the truth .
her heart is gone .
you mean it was ripped out of her chest ?
who the bloody hell would do that ?
regina .
she has her watchdog , maleficent ,
caring for it in the mayor &apos;s office .
now i need you to go and get it back .
give it to you ?
not likely , mate .
no , you &apos;re mistaken .
i &apos;m not asking .
want to talk about what happened back there ?
nope .
you nearly put that guy through a wall .
look , i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
but what happened back there wasn &apos;t me turning dark .
it was ... mourning a friend .
can you understand that ?
emma , you know you &apos;re not responsible
for what happened to her .
you sure ? you heard what that guy said .
her life wasn &apos;t pretty . it was dark .
that darkness was meant for me .
or could have been or --
emma !
you okay ?
this has happened before ,
the wolf in the road and an accident --
the first time i tried to leave storybrooke .
stop overthinking .
it &apos;s not fate . it &apos;s just a flat .
we need a new tire .
unless fate wants you to go to the coffee mug diner for help ,
i &apos;d chalk it up to &quot; accidents will happen . &quot;
i &apos;ll get a tire .
you get some coffee .
two cups of coffee and a pack of advil .
make it two packs .
tough day ?
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
i &apos;ll leave the pot here , then .
i &apos;ll be right back with your advil .
car &apos;s being towed in .
what &apos;s wrong ?
see another wolf ?
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s her .
it was my boyfriend &apos;s idea , okay ? i swear .
one minute , i think we &apos;re making a snack run ,
and the next , he tosses a gun at me
and tells me to watch the door .
a gun ? ! are you out of your mind ? !
you didn &apos;t have to go along with him !
i know . i know .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know how to explain it .
it doesn &apos;t matter what i do .
it &apos;s like every decision i make seems right , but it &apos;s wrong .
you got to leave .
the police are probably looking for you right now .
you &apos;re my only friend . i don &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
you can &apos;t stay here .
look , i &apos;ve got some allowance stashed away .
it &apos;ll be enough for a bus ticket .
no , i can &apos;t leave without my stuff .
it &apos;s at the house i was squatting in with my boyfriend .
forget the stuff . forget him .
i &apos;ll give you some clothes .
no , you don &apos;t understand-- there &apos;s this necklace ,
and it &apos;s the only thing i have from my birth mother ,
and i cannot leave it behind .
i can &apos;t .
you got to help me .
i would go , but my boyfriend
is the last person i want to see right now .
okay . i &apos;ll get your necklace .
but then you &apos;re gone !
starla .
is something wrong ?
did i bring you decaf by mistake ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i always get the pots mixed up .
starla isn &apos;t your name , is it ?
lily .
how do you know that ?
this mark .
you showed it to me a long time ago
outside a crappy cub foods in hopkins , minnesota .
emma ?
i thought you were dead . what the hell happened to you ?
i ... got into trouble , uh ...
with some bad people a couple years ago ,
and i needed a fresh start .
but i &apos;ve been careful . how did you find me ?
fate .
what ?
i know this is gonna sound crazy ,
but remember when we were kids ,
you used to say you and i were connected ?
like something was drawing us together ?
yeah , that &apos;s something teenage girls say ,
and then you braid each other &apos;s hair and become bffs .
what if you were right ?
what if ... there &apos;s a reason
your life has been on a downswing ever since we met ?
that all your problems are not your fault ,
they &apos;re ...
mine ?
you &apos;re right-- that sounds crazy .
it &apos;s complicated , but i can explain it if you come with me .
i just need you to trust me .
look , i don &apos;t know what kind of 12 @-@ step program you &apos;re in ,
but i &apos;ve moved on .
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re living in the middle of nowhere
under an assumed name .
i can help you .
i don &apos;t need your help .
and my life is great , thank you very much .
i have an awesome daughter and a loving husband .
the last thing i need is for you to come into my life
and just blow it apart again , so ...
if you &apos;ll excuse me , that &apos;s my daughter &apos;s bus .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry -- for ... everything .
you don &apos;t need to apologize .
we were kids .
to be honest , i haven &apos;t even thought about you in years .
yeah ?
yeah .
hey , sweetie !
tire &apos;s being fixed .
so it was her .
well , emma , looks like
you didn &apos;t ruin her life after all .
you know me from the diner , right ?
free burgers for a week if you smile , take my hand ,
and walk around the block with me .
but you have to decide now .
maleficent ?
go -- now .
i don &apos;t want to see either one of you .
just hear us out -- please .
we realized we &apos;ve been so concerned
about earning emma &apos;s forgiveness that ...
we forgot the person we hurt most .
so you &apos;re here to apologize .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not the one
whose forgiveness you really need .
your daughter .
she was an innocent .
it &apos;s her you need to apologize to .
we will .
we will do everything we can to make it up to her .
whatever it takes .
do you think that &apos;ll be enough ?
well , you &apos;ve been so worried
that the dark one might turn emma into a monster ,
you forgot --
that &apos;s exactly what you did to my lilith .
so , if i won &apos;t forgive you , why would she ?
emma , what are you doing ?
i just swiped starla &apos;s time card .
it has her real address .
but she said she didn &apos;t want our help .
and she was lying .
you saw her with her child .
a child . you know me .
i know when someone &apos;s lying ,
and she was . she always has .
why would she be any different now ?
something &apos;s wrong . we have to go find her .
i &apos;m gonna help her this time .
i &apos;m gonna get her back to her mom .
lily ?
lily ?
lily ?
emma ? where have you been ?
i just ... was in the garage , looking for a lantern .
where &apos;s lily ?
we were hoping you could tell us that .
she broke into my desk ,
and she stole our vacation money .
that &apos;s why she sent me for this --
to get me out of the house .
i had no idea . i swear .
we called your social worker , and she told us
that you and lily were never in the same group home .
she said that you know each other
because you were both caught for stealing .
i can explain .
we also called the police
once we realized that the money was missing .
you know what they said ?
lily is a suspect in a robbery .
i know . and that &apos;s why i told her she had to leave .
you knew ?
you brought a criminal into our home ?
you endanger our children ?
&quot; our &quot; children ?
emma , he didn &apos;t mean it like that .
no , i think he meant it exactly like that .
emma !
wait !
wait !
no kid &apos;s stuff .
no sign of a husband .
okay .
well , if you want me to admit you were right ...
well , you were right .
can &apos;t blame her for running off .
i was about to tell her she was maleficent &apos;s daughter .
yeah , that might have been tough to swallow .
yeah , well , you know how long it took for me to believe ,
and that was in storybrooke .
for her , it &apos;s not gonna be simple .
emma .
what ?
it might be simpler than you think .
son of a ...
she knew .
she already knew .
and she was looking for you .
no . my parents .
she knew everything . she wants revenge .
really ? !
lily !
emma !
the apprentice &apos;s scroll -- it was in my bag in the car !
she wanted a way into storybrooke . now she &apos;s got one .
what are you doing ?
that girl destroyed my life with one family .
i &apos;m not letting her do it again .
looking for your wife &apos;s heart ?
why don &apos;t you come inside and get it ?
i &apos;m smarter than that , dearie .
our work together is done .
regina and emma are tracking my daughter as we speak .
soon , i &apos;ll have her back .
and the savior will be just fine .
really ?
now , did you ever think that your lilith might be
the one who keeps ms. swan on her dark path ?
that two people tied by fate and history
might just have a way of ... entangling themselves ?
you can try to scare me all you want .
i won &apos;t return your wife &apos;s heart .
no , no , dearie .
you misunderstood .
i already have it .
regina &apos;s protection spell might keep me out ,
but it doesn &apos;t account for the common thief .
she &apos;s doing it again , regina .
every time i let lily in , she rips apart my life .
now she &apos;s going after my parents .
i have to stop her .
you will , but you can &apos;t go in with a head of steam .
you &apos;ll end up doing something you regret .
really ?
tell me , your majesty , what are your plans for zelena ?
a nice chat over tea ?
that &apos;s different .
how ?
if zelena lays a hand on robin hood ,
you &apos;ll destroy her , right ?
right .
so i &apos;ll do the same thing to lily .
careful , emma . you &apos;re starting to sound like --
like what ? a villain ?
this is the real world , regina .
there are no heroes and villains --
just real people with real problems .
so if you &apos;re gonna try to stop me ,
you can find your own way back to new york .
emma ?
of course you knew where to find me .
you knew your little stunt would get me kicked out .
just do me a favor and stay the hell away from me .
is that how you say &quot; thank you &quot; ?
for what ?
ruining my chance to be a part of that family ?
for setting you free , chore wheel .
with this cash ,
we can go anywhere and do whatever we want .
i wanted to stay there .
they cared about me , lily .
the moment they found out the truth about you ,
they turned on you .
they were frauds .
you &apos;re the fraud , lily .
you play the orphan card ,
but you have no idea what it &apos;s really like .
you think it &apos;s fun pretending to be a runaway .
this is my life !
emma , it &apos;s not like that .
here .
here &apos;s your stupid necklace .
now just go back to your lake house
and your credit cards
and your ... family ...
and leave me alone .
i can &apos;t go home . they kicked me out .
right .
emma , it &apos;s true .
i don &apos;t know how to explain it , but ...
ever since you left , everything has gotten worse .
my life , no matter what i do , is just wrong .
and that &apos;s my fault ?
maybe try making better choices .
i do .
i swear .
but every time i try , it just blows up in my face .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m cursed or something .
that &apos;s stupid .
it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s like my whole life is darkness , and ...
when you &apos;re around , things are brighter .
emma , please don &apos;t walk away again .
i &apos;m begging you .
please help me .
i &apos;m done helping you , lily .
i &apos;m better off alone .
there she is .
swan , watch it !
you know .
you know everything .
did you know when we were kids ?
of course not .
but now ?
yeah .
i learned it all .
how ?
does it really matter ?
it doesn &apos;t change anything .
you screwed me over before we were even born .
i had no more say in what happened than you did .
but your parents did .
and the minute i get to storybrooke --
you lay a hand on them , i end you !
emma , stop !
yeah ?
and how are you gonna do that without your magic , savior ?
your parents are monsters , emma .
they banished me and threw you in a wardrobe .
and now here you are , ready to die for them ,
because you &apos;re so perfect .
the savior .
well , they deserve to be punished .
and there &apos;s only one way to stop me , and you know it .
of course it ends this way .
this just makes too much sense .
i &apos;m just trying to stop you
from doing something you &apos;ll regret .
you can &apos;t .
thanks to you , i &apos;m hardwired for bad decisions .
so come on -- just put me out of my misery .
you know the truth .
we both know my life isn &apos;t worth saving .
and if you let me go , i will destroy everything .
it &apos;s what i do .
so come on -- be the hero
and end this right here before it even starts .
come on , emma .
swan .
put the gun down .
if you pull that trigger ,
you will be the one who ruins your life this time .
and henry &apos;s and your parents &apos; and everyone else &apos;s .
i have to protect them .
then lower the gun .
your parents need a hero , not a murderer .
i &apos;m already a murderer .
cruella was an accident .
but if you cross this line , the journey back isn &apos;t easy .
trust me -- i know .
this is what gold wants you to do .
so don &apos;t .
emma .
you &apos;re better than this .
that &apos;s a lovely necklace .
thanks .
did you ever notice
how it complements the birthmark on your wrist ?
how did you know that ?
i know about a lot of things , lilith .
don &apos;t be alarmed , child .
i can see that you have many questions .
fortunately , i have many answers .
answers ?
about who you really are
and why your life has always felt so ... wrong .
and who am i ?
a victim of the unfortunate vagaries of fate ,
for which , i &apos;m afraid , i am partially responsible .
in fact ...
i shouldn &apos;t even be telling you this .
you &apos;re crazy .
you are not as responsible for your own misery
as you would believe .
the deck has been stacked against you , lilith ,
and it &apos;s not your fault .
everything you do will be harder .
and i owe it to you to let you know why .
i owe you the truth .
okay , yoda .
enough riddles .
what &apos;s the truth ?
let &apos;s start with the necklace .
it isn &apos;t exactly a stone ,
but it did belong to your mother .
would you like to hear about her ?
why didn &apos;t you just kill me when you had the chance ?
i would have .
i like to think you wouldn &apos;t have .
isn &apos;t that the whole point of savior and anti @-@ savior ?
stop calling yourself that .
bad news from home .
i just lost my leverage over gold .
we have to get to robin hood -- now .
coming ?
you still want me to ?
yeah . i &apos;m not pushing you away this time .
there you are .
i brought you dinner from granny &apos;s .
will .
is something wrong ?
belle , there &apos;s something i need to show you .
is that ... ?
yeah .
yours .
it was regina .
why would she want my heart ?
to use you as a pawn against me .
okay . what are you doing here ?
i wanted to be certain that you got your , uh ...
heart back .
what -- y @-@ you two a @-@ are working together ?
we share one thing in common --
we both care for you .
belle , i need to say something .
i &apos;m not sure i want to hear it .
please , please .
i &apos;m not asking for forgiveness .
i spent every day of our marriage deceiving you ,
when i should have been trying to make you happy .
and now it &apos;s too late .
my heart is nearly black .
and if i continue hurting you ...
... then there &apos;s no hope for me .
i &apos;m gonna return this to you , belle .
but he &apos;s the one who &apos;s gonna protect it .
because i &apos;ve proven unworthy .
goodbye , belle .
robin ?
robin , open up !
regina ?
w @-@ what are you doing here ?
i missed you .
and i you .
what &apos;s going on ? w @-@ why are you here ?
i can explain everything . but first , where &apos;s marian ?
she &apos;s at the store . why ?
good . then there &apos;s time .
but we have to act fast .
wha--
w @-@ what &apos;s this about ?
marian -- we have to leave before she gets back .
she is not who she says she is .
what ?
she &apos;s ... my sister -- zelena .
the wicked witch ?
but she &apos;s dead . w @-@ we all saw that .
somehow , she tricked us and went back in time .
robin ...
she went back , and she killed marian .
she took her place to get back at me .
no .
this is madness .
