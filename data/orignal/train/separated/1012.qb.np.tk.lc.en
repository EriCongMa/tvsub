please tell me this isn &apos;t gonna
be another mortgage @-@ fraud case .
what &apos;s wrong with mortgage @-@ fraud cases ?
they &apos;re boring .
you stare at paperwork all day .
you could stare at prison bars all day .
oh , you still playing that card ?
makes me smile .
excuse me .
get out of the way .
why all the craziness ?
i don &apos;t know.this can &apos;t be good .
peter , uh , hughes wants to see you right away .
all right .
so , is this what it looked like when i escaped ?
i don &apos;t know.i was working important cases .
what &apos;s going on ?
the bureau &apos;s missing an agent .
that isn &apos;t good .
yeah , he &apos;s an undercover from the d.c. office .
we lost contact with him 12 hours ago .
what do you think happened ?
i don &apos;t know.could be in trouble , could be laying .
we &apos;re not sure .
listen . listen to me .
we need somebody who understands money .
excuse me.i have an important case to deal with .
this is agent mark costa .
he was posing as a drug trafficker
looking to clean some dirty cash through this guy
lao shen , money launderer out of china .
costa was working him until last night .
according to his last contact ,
lao was making a pit stop in new york for 72 hours
and after that , he boards a flight to the homeland
and we lose him .
so , why are you telling me this ?
nicholas halden .
who ?
cut the crap , neal .
we know he &apos;s one of your aliases .
you created him to launder cash through
that canary island scam you ran in &apos; 04 .
multimillionaire with a penchant for gambling .
ringing any bells ?
i may have heard of him .
are you willing to offer him full immunity ?
done.i don &apos;t give a damn what you did five years ago .
i want to find my agent .
then what can nick do to help ?
we want you to make contact with lao using this identity .
what do you know about pai gow ?
i know it sounds delicious .
it &apos;s a chinese version of poker played with dominoes .
not really my game .
make it your game .
lao likes to contact new clients
using certain hands or bets .
he &apos;ll be playing an underground table
in chinatown tomorrow night .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you
this is a dangerous one , caffrey .
high stakes .
i &apos;m in .
i asked you to teach me the game . this movie is terrible .
wait .
let &apos;s take this to the next level .
you took it to the next level when you killed my family .
your wager , then .
100 grand ?
how did he know about nick halden ?
surely you can &apos;t believe they knew about him .
steve was a good man .
steve is a good man .
besides , you should be more concerned
with what the guy with the ring wants .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve stolen a lot of stuff in my lifetime .
maybe poe &apos;s &quot; tamerlane &quot; book ?
no , no . sold that a while back .
the tamayo painting .
not worth all this .
washington &apos;s love letters .
seriously , i don &apos;t even know why you
stole that in the first place .
martha
it &apos;s my favorite part .
too rich for your blood , lee @-@ kang ?
i believe it is your blood that
will make me rich ... farmer boy .
okay , what are they doing right now ?
oh , they &apos;re drawing from the wood pile .
with these tiles , they make two hands .
oh , wait ! wait !
he just played the death tile .
death tile ?
w @-@ well , the movie takes a few liberties .
then why are we watching it ?
it &apos;s a cult classic !
okay , fine.what do you have to do ?
fold above the bank .
if i get a better hand than the dealer and
then throw it away , lao knows i &apos;m a prospect .
okay .
well ... ideally , you want something like this .
this is some of the best tiles you can get .
you trash a hand like this ,
and you &apos;re in .
it &apos;s like folding pocket aces .
all right . then let &apos;s practice .
all you have to do is lose .
you want to practice losing ?
no , i have to win first , then lose .
i thought perhaps you gentlemen
might like something to eat .
oh , thank you , june .
thanks , june .
what are you watching ?
&quot; tiles of fire . &quot;
part 1 ?
part 2 &apos;s up next .
don &apos;t start without me .
there &apos;s a sequel ?
five .
good news . we &apos;ve put word out nicholas halden
is in town and looking to do business .
lao &apos;s people took the bait .
we &apos;re sending you in as an investor
to his money @-@ laundering scheme .
lao &apos;s game takes place just off of mott street ,
which means we &apos;ll be setting up around the corner .
at meishilin restaurant ?
been there . good dumplings .
and an even better h.q. for our purposes .
family that owns the place are trusted c.i.s for the bureau .
they &apos;ve had dealings with lao in the past .
we &apos;ll monitor the game from the second floor .
look ... there &apos;s an agent missing in all this .
so everyone stay sharp .
the fbi is truly grateful for your help , mr.tuan.
i just want lao out of the neighborhood .
he &apos;s been taking from my business for years .
and with my own debt piling up ,
i can hardly afford to be in his .
i understand .
look ... i , too , am grateful for your help .
come on .
those standard fbi issue ?
they were a gift from elizabeth .
one that keeps on giving .
we tried to make room .
it &apos;s perfect .
apologies .
my daughter , bai .
uh ... hi , there .
i &apos;m gonna need that back , okay ?
there . thank you .
who are you ?
what do you mean ? the kid just grabbed the
do you have a business card ?
do you have a business .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . ready ? watch this .
ready ? one ... two ... three !
where &apos;d it go ? where &apos;d it go ? where &apos;d it go ?
is it right here ? is it right there ?
how silly . here you go .
xie xie .
you know , every time i see you do that
i check for my wallet .
all right .
let &apos;s get you suited up .
game starts in 10 .
you reviewed the building layout ?
camera surveillance , electronic passcode .
it &apos;s standard stuff .
any questions ?
just one .
where did elizabeth buy those socks ?
cause christmas is coming up soon .
enough .
there is one small problem .
what ?
that &apos;s a really nice fake .
it &apos;s more concerned with telling us
where you are than telling time .
we deactivated your anklet 30 seconds ago .
lauren , if you &apos;ll do the honors .
be gentle .
yeah , never really been the gentle type .
all right . there &apos;s a gsm transmitter inside .
it &apos;s one @-@ way , but we &apos;ll be able
to hear everything that happens .
everything ?
lao is dangerous , neal .
we are pulling you the first sign of trouble .
i &apos;ll be fine . as long as i don &apos;t draw the death tile .
there &apos;s a death tile ?
halden .
nick halden .
halden &apos;s golden .
he got through .
what happened here ?
lao .
he was in your home ?
no , his men .
they came in one night to make sure i would pay .
with a gun .
they fired a bullet 2 inches from my baby &apos;s crib
while bai was still sleeping in it .
how you doing ?
don &apos;t get &apos; em wet , don &apos;t feed &apos; em after midnight , right ?
never mind .
yung sing .
it &apos;s a toast -- drink and win .
yung sing .
one down ... one to go .
8 and 7 . nice hand .
i &apos;m out .
you could have won .
i have more important things than winning .
you folded on a good hand , mr ... ?
you know who i am .
and you know why i &apos;m here .
for a man of your reputation , mr. halden ,
it took some time for you to find the hand you needed .
pai gow isn &apos;t my game .
what is your game ?
perhaps we should discuss that in private .
we have time for that .
another hand ?
don &apos;t rush him , neal .
i &apos;m always in for one more game .
good . good .
peter , we got a problem .
nypd got a tip @-@ off . they &apos;re about to raid the game .
who the hell tipped them off ?
i have no clue .
they &apos;re gonna get neal killed .
you get me captain shattuck of nypd
before they crash this whole thing .
cops !
they &apos;re not with me .
i don &apos;t believe in coincidence .
maybe you should .
nypd , stay where you are .
lao , let &apos;s go .
just go , go , go .
put your hands on the table !
everyone down ! down ! freeze ! we will shoot .
freeze !
come on , neal . just give yourself up .
tell them you &apos;re fbi .
fired . shots fired .
we have a white male , 6 @-@ foot , gray suit
heading out of the building .
i don &apos;t think he gave himself up .
maybe it &apos;s not him .
trying to save my cover here , guys .
it &apos;s him . all right .
if he &apos;s not with me in three minutes ,
you mobilize backup
and tell nypd to stay the hell out of our way !
and where are my damn shoes ? !
i &apos;m getting a little tired of being chased , peter .
call the cops off me .
where is he , jones ?
he &apos;s moving north on allen .
it &apos;s okay .
lao says to let me handle it .
have i thanked you for that drink ?
no .
remind me to .
lao knows why you folded back there .
he respects it .
come with me , and you can complete your business .
is he gonna point any more guns at me ?
you &apos;ll be fine . trust me .
then lead the way .
you getting this , peter ?
he &apos;s trying to save the operation .
looks like they &apos;re heading to a hotel of mulberry .
if caffrey doesn &apos;t leave chinatown , then neither do we .
jones , i want two of our guys positioned in the front
and rear of the place .
once that &apos;s settled ,
find out what the hell happened back there .
get the nypd call log , for starters .
i &apos;m not buying this coincidence at all .
who is this girl ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna find out .
where do you want me to start ?
plenty of traffic cams in the area .
have nypd pull a photo from one of those .
another all @-@ nighter ?
i married a perceptive woman .
and i married a predictable man .
all right . so no dinner tonight .
how about lunch tomorrow ?
that sounds great .
what did neal do now ?
nothing ... yet .
you know , i wouldn &apos;t worry too much about him .
he respects you , you know .
i think you &apos;re overselling our bond a little bit .
i don &apos;t .
good luck .
nice place .
when will lao be joining us ?
he won &apos;t be .
then what are we doing here ?
he told me to stay the night with you .
there &apos;s only one bed .
i wasn &apos;t planning on sleeping . were you ?
let me get you a drink .
only caffrey .
already seen this one on cinemax .
i haven &apos;t .
lao says i should keep an eye on you
until we can arrange another meeting .
so , what do we do until then ?
relax ?
have a drink ?
i &apos;m good for now .
it &apos;s not drugged or poisoned .
why don &apos;t you just relax ?
let &apos;s start with this .
what are you doing ?
taking you off the clock .
what happened ?
we just lost his transmitter .
should we go in ?
no . we &apos;ve got guys on the entrances .
we can track caffrey if he leaves the room .
assuming he leaves the room .
hey , that was an expensive ... - fake ?
i am really tired of guns being pointed at me tonight .
nicholas halden isn &apos;t the kind of man
who would wear a fake watch .
neal caffrey , on the other hand ...
you know who i am ?
you &apos;ve been on our watch list for years .
could you be more specific ?
cause i &apos;ve been on so many , it &apos;s kind of hard to keep track .
interpol .
you know my name , but i don &apos;t know yours .
my name is meilin .
why is interpol interfering in an fbi investigation ?
it &apos;s the other way around .
you called the cops .
and you screwed everything up
by impressing lao with your fancy table tricks .
now i &apos;m stuck with you .
well , am i such a bad guy to be stuck with ?
if you take lao , we &apos;ll never get to his boss .
he &apos;s a much bigger fish .
yeah , i get it . turf war . so , why are we here ?
you &apos;re gonna let lao walk .
yeah , i don &apos;t know if you heard ,
but the bureau and i are kind of pals lately .
i can &apos;t flip on them .
you can botch the deal .
besides , if you help me ,
i &apos;ll make sure you get the one thing you want most .
what , a new watch ?
kate .
what do you know about kate ?
i know where she is .
i can help you with that .
i think i &apos;ll take that drink now .
oh , damn .
oh , i told you to wake me if i drifted off .
oh , come on , boss . you needed a break .
anything happen ?
nope .
how long have i been out ?
uh , about a half an hour .
okay .
get some rest . i &apos;ll take over .
okay .
what happened to my sock ?
i don &apos;t know . i was watching the monitor , remember ?
did you steal my sock ?
you &apos;re a little klepto , aren &apos;t you ?
you have no idea what i &apos;m saying , do you ?
no . keep that up , you &apos;ll end up like neal .
you don &apos;t want that . trust me .
he &apos;s unreliable .
he never listens to you .
and he always gets himself into trouble .
i mean , it &apos;s not like i &apos;m worried about him .
i just feel responsible .
anything happens to him ,
i &apos;ll have a lot of paperwork to fill out .
paperwork &apos;s a hassle .
neal &apos;s a hassle .
but then again , that was a neat card trick , huh ?
nice to know i &apos;m appreciated .
i knew you were there .
yeah ?
yeah .
you also know she speaks perfect english ?
you &apos;re weird .
i want my sock back .
you &apos;re a bad influence .
how &apos;d you get here ?
i , uh , caught a lift with one of the g @-@ men
you put in front of the hotel .
i told those guys to call me if they saw you .
no , i told them not to bother you .
you get a little cranky if you don &apos;t get your beauty sleep .
what happened to the watch ?
i must have banged it up during the chase .
when did it cut out ?
while you were in the hotel room .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
guess you missed all the good stuff .
so , can she make the meet happen ?
she &apos;ll contact me with the time and place .
good . jones , if you &apos;ll do the honors .
uh , nypd traced their tip @-@ off on the game to
a cellphone registered to a ms. meilin wang .
it &apos;s the same girl caffrey had a sleepover with last night .
are you sure about that ?
yeah .
that &apos;s from a traffic cam about a block away
at the exact same time the call was placed .
uh , carrier company lists a hostess bar
on canal as her place of business .
i want to check it out .
i &apos;m curious why ms. meilin wants
to call the cops on lao &apos;s game --
especially if she wants to keep your deal alive .
you got a problem with that ?
let &apos;s go .
looks like our employees are on break right now .
any thoughts on how to approach this one ? no ?
isn &apos;t this the part where you say ,
&quot; we should buy them a drink &quot; ?
i can &apos;t go in there . it &apos;ll blow my cover .
guess i &apos;ll have to show you how it &apos;s done .
hello .
agent burke , fbi .
i want to ask you a few questions about
one of your co @-@ workers -- ms. meilin wang .
uh , one at ... one at ... one at a time , please .
could ... does anyone ... does anyone
know where she is right now ?
oh , really ? do you know where she lives ?
that &apos;s the same guy who caught me , right ?
that &apos;s the guy who caught you twice .
does anyone speak english ? anyone ?
no . o @-@ okay . all right .
all right , thank you . thanks very much .
so that &apos;s how it &apos;s done ?
yeah , that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
amazing what someone will say when they don &apos;t think
that you can speak their language , isn &apos;t it ?
have a translator meet us at the office .
let &apos;s see what they were saying
behind the back of the bumbling fbi agent .
where &apos;s the translator ?
won &apos;t be here for another hour .
oh , damn it .
all right , let her run .
maybe we can pick up a name , at the very least .
meilin wang . what ?
meilin wang . oh , really ? did you ...
catch anything ?
not so much .
where are subtitles when you need them ?
someone called you a bad name .
there you are . sorry about that .
we &apos;re , uh , taking victor &apos;s statement , and
i guess she heard your voice .
all right , let &apos;s go .
hold on .
i got an idea .
these ladies are mean .
they think you &apos;re stupid .
leave that out .
something about meilin working
a night shift a place called red lantern .
where do i know that from ?
well , it could be a club or a restaurant .
could be a sunburnt superhero .
it &apos;s a waste , peter .
following meilin &apos;s not getting us
any closer to lao or costa .
found it . red lantern exports .
it looks like costa suspected
it was a shell company for lao .
that &apos;s what he was looking into before he disappeared .
so she had a part @-@ time job at a warehouse .
that &apos;s an eclectic rum ?
still wasting our time ?
jones , look up that address for me .
so , the results on meilin &apos;s facial scan came back .
you got anything ?
nothing ...
because it came back restricted .
restricted ?
which means she &apos;s either a c.i.
or working for another organization .
run it through the interagency database .
already did .
she &apos;s interpol .
wow , you think neal knows ?
well , he spent six hours alone
with her in a room -- he knows .
maybe he was keeping his cover .
okay . he knows .
he &apos;s playing me .
well ... there &apos;s really only one reason
why he would keep something from you .
just one ?
kate .
what are you gonna do ?
pick that for me .
don &apos;t we need a warrant ?
oh , look at you . a law @-@ abiding citizen all of a sudden .
i got goose bumps .
agent costa already filed for one .
i don &apos;t have my tools .
well , i got mine .
i think i just saw the ark of the covenant back there .
if my face melts , let me know .
neal .
sign of a struggle .
scuff marks .
looks like someone was dragged right down that way .
blood .
it &apos;s agent costa .
lao &apos;s men .
i didn &apos;t see an alarm system .
they &apos;re not here for us .
then who ?
costa .
oh , come on . no service .
no , no ! what are you ...
you got a better idea ?
i let them walk right out the door !
oh , would you rather be dead ?
this isn &apos;t a game , neal .
i think it &apos;s time you and i had a little heart @-@ to @-@ heart .
about what ?
your friend at interpol .
look , i never lied to peter .
you did leave a few things out .
you don &apos;t understand .
i need to find kate .
she &apos;s in danger .
look , my husband really wants to trust you ,
but you keep giving him reasons not to .
you &apos;re on your own on this one .
no ! please stay ! don &apos;t go !
so , what now ?
now i wouldn &apos;t take you off this case if i could .
i wasn &apos;t talking about the case .
what did interpol promise you ?
did meilin promise you kate ?
look , what was i supposed to do ?
she said she could find her .
in exchange for what ?
they want lao to walk .
do you know why ?
they &apos;re after his boss .
lao doesn &apos;t have a boss .
you know what this is really about ?
it &apos;s about jurisdiction .
if they arrest him on asian soil ,
they get additional funding from china &apos;s government .
additional funding ?
yeah .
half a million dollars
that &apos;s the price of a dead fbi agent .
you really think you can believe everything she tells you ?
we either take down lao now ,
or our partnership comes to an end .
we &apos;re partners ?
you tell me .
hello , neal , dear .
i was just having a charming conversation with your friend .
it has been wonderful to meet you .
likewise , june .
now that i know you &apos;re such a wonderful host
don &apos;t be surprised if i stop by again soon .
i &apos;d keep my eye on that one .
what happened to costa ?
what , no small talk ?
i saw a dead fbi agent today .
not really feeling like small talk .
i &apos;m the reason you found that body .
you expect me to believe you
left a bread @-@ crumb trail on purpose ?
your agent deserved a proper burial .
well , he didn &apos;t get one .
was his cover blown ?
lao suspected he was working for
a competitor , not a government .
you don &apos;t believe me .
i have pretty good reason not to .
you lied to me about why you want lao .
and ?
and you &apos;re letting a murderer go
free to curry political favor .
if that sits right with you ,
then maybe i should rethink our arrangement .
i &apos;m just doing my job .
and right now , my job is to make sure the fbi
can &apos;t monitor any of lao &apos;s accounts
during your meeting tomorrow .
doesn &apos;t matter to me what happens after that .
neal ?
the man who &apos;s got kate ... i know who it is .
anklet off .
and you &apos;d better not break this one .
when they scan you for bugs ,
manually deactivate the transmitter .
press it again , it turns it back on ,
and you damn well better turn it back on .
i will , peter .
once you give lao our account number ,
we &apos;ll be able to scan the dirty money .
between that and the audio from the watch ,
we &apos;ll be able to put this guy away for good .
anything else ?
yeah .
good luck in there .
do you have the account number ?
and you &apos;re ready for this ?
ready .
he cut the signal .
what &apos;s important is when he turns it back on .
keep an eye on the bank account .
i &apos;m gonna give you a new account number to use
one the fbi can &apos;t trace .
131278871 .
got it ? repeat it to me .
i got it .
relax , neal .
it &apos;s almost over .
i apologize for the scene the other night .
as you know , you can never be too careful .
oh , i completely understand .
i think you &apos;ll find this to be the beginning of
a very rewarding relationship for both of us .
i hope so .
meilin speaks very highly of you , mr.halden.
the account number , if you please .
131278871 .
any movement on the account ?
nothing .
come on , neal .
and just like that , we are partners .
we &apos;ll contact you in two weeks
with your money , minus the 10 % fee , of course .
of course .
all right , i did what you wanted . now tell me who has kate .
it &apos;s all in there .
hey , lao .
we never got to finish our game .
i &apos;ll make it worth your while ... an extra 10 % if you win .
very well .
come .
lose your money .
what are you doing ?
oh , i already transferred the money from your account .
doesn &apos;t matter what happens now , right ?
one more hand and i &apos;ll have all of your money .
are you certain you want to go again ?
just to keep things interesting ... my watch for yours .
come on , lao .
what &apos;s life without a little risk ?
why not ?
the signal &apos;s back .
what is that ?
that sounds like dominoes .
you look worried .
do i ?
yung sing .
yung sing .
some days , the tiles don &apos;t fall the way we want .
some days they do .
at least i lost my watch to a worthy adversary .
it appears luck was not on your side today .
the strange thing ...
even though my profits are one hundredfold in business ,
a victory with the tiles is supremely more satisfying .
the american had no talent .
they rarely do .
the outstanding parcels have been delivered .
and the body ?
disposed of , sir .
good .
a dirty business . it will be a relief to be home .
anything good on the radio ?
we got him .
he &apos;ll be gone for a long time .
lao may as well have confessed in front of a grand jury
with the hours of transcript we have on him .
i just want to thank you and let you
know that you are welcome here anytime .
neighborhood &apos;s better off without lao .
you know i think these are the best dumpling i &apos;ve ever had .
i &apos;ll get you some more .
so , are you gonna tell me what was on that flash drive ?
you were right .
it was empty .
oh , no .
close your eyes .
why ?
would you just close them ?
open .
david copperfield she ain &apos;t .
xie @-@ xie ni .
what &apos;s next , partner ?
don &apos;t call me that .
yeah ?
hello , meal .
you calling to apologize about the empty flash drive ?
that was a necessary precaution .
i had to be careful with something this sensitive .
so you know who has kate ?
i don &apos;t have a name , but i know this -- he &apos;s fbi .
* take me away from here *
how do you know ?
how do you know that ?
like the morning after the rain
you know i worry all the time
what &apos;s coming around the bend
maybe i &apos;m just going crazy
* but it feels like *
it feels like
it feels like , it feels like , it feels like
it feels like the end
so do i. i want the man who &apos;s got her .
