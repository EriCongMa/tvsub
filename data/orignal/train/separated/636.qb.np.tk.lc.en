my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
you will always be the clueless frat boy
who crashed your car , crushed my spine ,
and never looked back .
she lost her job . helping her get another
was the least i could do .
i thought you were set for life , sara . i &apos;m sorry .
why are you doing this , daniel ?
to earn your forgiveness .
you &apos;re the first person in a long time
to be able to make me smile .
jack went to conrad and told him
that patrick tampered with his brakes .
he &apos;s probably being chased out of town as we speak .
conrad is a ruthless man . you &apos;re not safe .
i can &apos;t .
go !
growing up , my father said the ocean
was a great escape .
as time passed , i also learned
that its expanse holds greater secrets
and the ability to hold mine ...
and that like love , it is at its heart
fluid , powerful , and sometimes violent .
next time you &apos;re here ,
the authorities will have victoria in custody .
soon after , i &apos;ll take you away from everything ...
and everyone .
but in its harshest reality ,
the ocean is a barrier
separating you from those you love .
when this is done , i &apos;ll never see my sister again ...
or nolan .
i know .
you &apos;ll be okay .
are you writing a letter to patrick--
your natural born killer ?
it &apos;s the only means of correspondence i have
to keep away from the prying eyes
of the minions i &apos;m sure you have looking for him .
why would i waste the time and effort ?
it &apos;s that smug smirk i &apos;m going to miss the least
after we &apos;ve converted our money ,
and i have left you for good .
now there &apos;s an action that may compel me
to hire some folks to go looking for your boy .
excuse my confusion , conrad ,
but are you threatening patrick to keep me by your side ?
you know , i believe i am ...
starting with your magnificent presence downstairs
for the little grayson confab
you &apos;ve obviously forgotten about .
i &apos;ve enlisted a p.r. specialist to help right the course
of my trajectory .
so if you value patrick &apos;s freedom ,
you know , you may want to find some public worth
in the family you still have .
i still don &apos;t see why we &apos;re here .
if my father wants to rehab his image ,
he can do it himself .
i &apos;ve already educated him on rebranding
and how you &apos;re all an extension of his good name .
i &apos;m a clarke .
whoever you are .
that whole &quot; slumming it in montauk &quot; thing ...
gold . people love it when the rich help the poor .
but where &apos;s the bang for my wedding buck ?
there were no cameras when you went ring shopping .
has the venue even been announced ?
who &apos;s making the cake ?
we are not a very showy couple .
is it we ? or is you ?
i am damn good at doing my research ,
and you &apos;re a mystery .
you need to be more like daniel .
that publisher &apos;s profile is exactly the kind
of rebound story i love .
hurt a girl ... tortured soul ...
redemption .
and i just hired sara at the stowaway .
really ?
we ran into her . it &apos;s a long story .
one i need to hear .
if i am to guide your father back into america &apos;s hearts ,
i run the narrative on this family from here on out .
i see you couldn &apos;t even extend the courtesy of waiting ,
ms. preston .
&quot; bizzy , &quot; please .
bizzy .
it &apos;s such a pleasure , victoria .
and i figured i might as well get a jump on the kids
so as not to waste your time .
while i applaud your gumption , bizzy ,
i feel this independence day party i &apos;m throwing ,
along with emily &apos;s wedding shower ,
should prove sufficient for the society papers .
that won &apos;t help if those rags think
that you two are still at odds .
the last event you attended led to a fight
worthy of pay @-@ per @-@ view .
and since there is little benefit in positioning conrad
as master of a house divided ,
i need to rewrite your story ... pronto .
and how do you propose to do that ?
first off , i am plugging your 4th of july party
as the reintroduction of the happy grayson clan ,
followed by a mother / daughter @-@ in @-@ law
goodwill tour that i will lay out for you
when the three of us have lunch tomorrow .
right there ...
that &apos;s all i need-- you two .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna get .
trying to get some scoop on the wedding ?
they &apos;ve got big things planned .
i &apos;m sure they do .
what brings you by ?
i ... brought you some macaroons
to welcome you back .
thanks .
that &apos;s a nice surprise .
how was l.a. ?
wining and dining photographers for &quot; voulez &quot;
is not as glamorous as one might think .
oh , really ? weird .
i &apos;ve had a totally different experience when doing it .
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;re free tonight ?
ooh . he comes bearing gifts ,
and now he &apos;s looking for a date ?
i should leave town more often .
but no . i have too much work to catch up on
with the wedding approaching .
ah , it &apos;ll still be here tomorrow .
don &apos;t let the graysons take over your life .
i &apos;ve lost my touch .
a week later , and all i &apos;ve dug up
is a one @-@ way flight from philly to richmond ?
i just want to know that patrick &apos;s all right .
well , you should be happy that he &apos;s not here .
he would also be scrutinized by the publicist conrad hired .
she wants me and victoria to play nice for the press .
oh , you and vicky , besties--
that kind of runs counter to your master plan
of framing her for your murder , no ?
exactly .
which is why p.r. maven bizzy preston
is becoming a problem that i don &apos;t have time for .
what , you know her ?
and loat her .
back in the day , i was , uh , dating this guy .
it was casual ... fun .
then i met his sister--
up @-@ and @-@ coming pop star , sage .
and she was more casual , more fun ...
and as it turned out , married .
the press got ahold of our one @-@ hit wonder ,
and bizzy squashed it ...
by claiming i was gay .
i remember when that happened . it was right when we met .
i didn &apos;t know that she was behind it .
neither did my father .
after years of being estranged ,
nolcorp &apos;s success had finally gotten us back on good terms ,
even planning a visit to new york
to see my r &amp; d facility .
programmed a robot to open him a beer .
then ... he read the press release ,
canceled his trip ...
never spoke to me again .
i &apos;m sorry , nolan .
bizzy &apos;s the one who should be sorry .
and we have to stop you from becoming the next victim
of her p.r. machine .
she makes a living covering her clients &apos; secrets .
we just have to expose them .
yeah , but that &apos;s not a simple task .
she would do anything to protect &apos; em ,
and the greater the retainer , the bigger her allegiance .
and i know a family who &apos;s paying top dollar .
what are you thinking ?
she could help us with victoria before we make her suffer .
it &apos;s not that easy .
she &apos;s smart , dangerous , lethal with information .
well , i &apos;m not afraid to give her some .
it &apos;s time she found out about my first husband .
things were slow back there , so , uh ...
i whipped up a little something .
is this another attempt to get desserts
put on the menu ?
can you blame a girl for trying ?
i &apos;m glad you joined the crew around here .
you &apos;re a--you &apos;re a breath of fresh air .
thanks .
i got some stuff to do in the storeroom .
i was just on my way out to lunch .
i hope you don &apos;t mind me stopping by .
well , it is a bar . that &apos;s kinda the point , right ?
you settling in ?
it &apos;s only been a week , but i can &apos;t complain .
you obviously miss your job at the bakery .
i know that look .
it means you got something on the brain .
i know this pastry thing has always been a dream of yours .
and this might sound crazy , but ...
what if you were to make the cake for my wedding ?
right ...
&apos;cause that wouldn &apos;t be weird .
if we make it weird .
come on . we haven &apos;t hired anybody yet .
you know ...
when i saw you the other night after my shift ,
i thought you were just handing me a bunch of crap
about earning my forgiveness .
i told you , that &apos;s not who i am anymore .
i want to help .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t want your charity , danny .
good , &apos; cause i &apos;m not offering you any .
what i am offering is a chance at a job you want--
one that could be good for you .
think about it .
like i said , he &apos;d be perfect for a profile piece
in your magazine . think about it .
sorry . this thing beats more often than my heart .
especially now that i &apos;m keeping you all dry under my umbrella .
conrad did not tell me just how much
this family was weighing him down .
i don &apos;t understand . is that why i &apos;m here ?
uh , a blogger called about a piece that i planted
about you and daniel--
how socialite emily thorne
waited to find her prince charming .
it &apos;s ... good . but ...
this weasel claims to have proof
that you were hitched before .
what ?
i was really young .
it was a mistake . i mean , surely you understand .
actually ...
i &apos;m one of the lucky few who was right
about her high school sweetheart .
jeff and i have been together for 22 years .
and we are still as in love as i &apos;m sure you and daniel are .
this can &apos;t get out .
i &apos;m a gravedigger , babe .
i bury things bigger than this every day .
good , &apos; cause nobody can know ,
especially victoria .
we &apos;re not really the best of friends .
i just can &apos;t win with her .
if she finds this out , she will never forgive me .
well ... i caught the bullet this time .
but secrets have a way of bleeding out .
so let &apos;s cut to the chase .
what else are you hiding ?
nothing , i swear .
can i help you with something ?
conrad &apos;s hired a publicist who &apos;s determined
to put a sheen on everything we do ,
including promoting this wedding ,
which if we don &apos;t act quickly ,
it &apos;ll be too late to do anything .
i thought you were relying on jack porter
to break them up .
i &apos;ve heard that he &apos;s courting ms.lemarchal.
so clearly that won &apos;t be coming to fruition .
then we &apos;ll find another way .
oh , we won &apos;t .
you will .
my son has no shortage of hatred towards you .
so get back in emily &apos;s life ...
and more importantly , her bed .
the blogger persona was convincing .
let &apos;s just hope bizzy spreads the news like i want her to .
oh , trust me .
she knows that sharing information like that
keeps her on the grayson payroll .
and once she does , the two of us
will biz @-@ mantle her with glee .
you sure you &apos;re up for it , grandpa ?
i &apos;m not getting older , just ... wiser .
but trying to unearth bizzy &apos;s clients &apos; secrets
is taking longer than i thought .
hacking her proton 5 firewall
will take time that i don &apos;t have .
why the look ?
if this had happened a few years ago ,
you would have thrown a martini in her face
and called it a day . but now ...
i &apos;m standing up for myself .
i just ...
buried the pain of what happened with my father ,
but because of you , i &apos;m not just facing it .
i &apos;m doing something .
i &apos;ve learned a lot from you , ems .
we made a great team .
well , if we &apos;re gonna win ...
we &apos;re gonna need a new game plan .
i don &apos;t have the time for this firewall ,
so we &apos;ve got to get her password .
except that phone never leaves her hands .
maybe it doesn &apos;t need to .
i &apos;m glad i decided to take the evening off .
it &apos;s beautiful out here , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , it &apos;s like your own little sanctuary .
where no one can find us .
what ?
uh , have i done something wrong ?
no . no .
it &apos;s ...
let &apos;s just try to enjoy the movie
and have another glass of wine .
unless ... i can go downstairs and make another drink .
no , i don &apos;t need anything from the bar .
wine it is , then .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
okay , i think it &apos;s best if i go .
margaux .
it &apos;s okay .
i have an early morning .
enjoy your beautiful evening .
you &apos;re late .
daniel held me up .
he wants his ex @-@ girlfriend to make our wedding cake .
he set up a tasting at my house tomorrow .
do you suspect something &apos;s amiss ?
no . i &apos;m sure he &apos;s doing it out of guilt .
daniel &apos;s the reason i needed to meet with you .
victoria &apos;s compelled me to get back into your orbit
in order to drive a wedge between the two of you .
well , that &apos;s not an option , not this close to the wedding .
yeah , but if i don &apos;t see it through ,
i may lose access to the graysons .
maybe there &apos;s a third way .
and that is ?
to be seen together ...
but on our own terms .
this is the last one , i promise .
are you kidding me ?
each one &apos;s been better than the last .
are these ... family recipes ?
yeah , passed down from my mom &apos;s side .
well , your mom taught you well .
well , she raised me and my brother
after my dad ditched us , so everything i know
i learned from her ,
including how to make a mess .
i am so sorry about this disaster .
oh , don &apos;t worry about it .
but ... i better stop ,
or i &apos;ll be full for my lunch with victoria .
well , if it &apos;d help make the lunch shorter ,
i &apos;d say eat up .
thanks again ...
for giving me a shot .
of course . thank you . see ya .
i really appreciate you considering this .
it &apos;s just something i ... i want to do , you know ?
it &apos;s a great thing that you &apos;re doing .
and i ... i think she &apos;ll make a wonderful wedding cake .
me , too .
i &apos;ll see you later , okay ?
you got the job .
shut up . seriously ?
i &apos;m serious .
man , she is way more mature than i am . i mean ...
letting your fiance &apos;s ex make your wedding cake ...
if the tables were turned , i would be so jealous
and would have canceled the whole thing .
oh , well , that &apos;s emily .
and you ...
even asking her to let me make the cake ...
that took guts . i mean , what if these were awful ?
i knew they wouldn &apos;t be .
i gotta say that , uh ...
forgiveness thing you were looking for ...
this goes a long way toward it .
i should clean up .
hey , let me help you . i @-@ i got it . i can help ..
no , danny , you hired me . it &apos;s my job .
then i &apos;m giving you the rest of the day off .
go home .
so ... how was your date with margaux ?
things were fine ...
until ... they weren &apos;t .
okay . what happened ?
she left in the middle of it .
what , for no reason ? what &apos;s up , jack ?
i just ...
i blew it .
i mean , i didn &apos;t want to , but i just ..
i couldn &apos;t handle it .
you know what this is , right ?
yeah .
i think ...
maybe it &apos;s time to face it .
i must admit , i was a bit surprised
when i heard from your publicist .
so she tells me you &apos;re looking for some press coverage .
oh , uh , there must be some confusion .
what ms. preston offered you was an exclusive .
conrad grayson is back . he &apos;s a survivor ...
a laudatory profile of sorts .
it &apos;s out of the question .
we have to maintain journalistic integrity .
though covering daniel &apos;s wedding isn &apos;t a conflict of interest ?
too shame . mr. grayson .
but there is a difference between a society piece
and an advertisement for you .
now , if you were to give me access to all your papers
and ... archives ... then maybe we could talk .
ms. lemarchal , i &apos;m not here to dwell the past .
well , if you &apos;re not willing to be totally honest with me ,
i &apos;m not comfortable moving forward .
but i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a story in you no one expects .
you just need the guts to tell it .
you see how easy this is ?
with you two on the same page , it won &apos;t pull focus
as we can ease conrad back into the spotlight .
well , this itinerary is too aggressive .
surely the 200 people i &apos;m hosting this evening
means i &apos;ve done my duty .
you know better than most
that changing public opinion takes time .
and i have mere weeks until everyone sees you
as the new ideal of a mother and daughter @-@ in @-@ law
at the bridal shower .
that should be an interesting challenge .
not for women of your stature .
if your conflict creates such sparks ,
imagine what a partnership can do .
well , i &apos;d certainly marvel to see it .
aiden , what a coincidence .
well , in ... in truth , it &apos;s not .
i know i &apos;m ... i &apos;m being forward ,
but i was hoping to steal ms. thorne .
i have nothing to say to you .
why don &apos;t you go , emily ?
you clearly have things to resolve .
thank you for lunch , bizzy .
of course .
after you . thank you .
sweet girl .
emily obviously craves your approval .
you know , i would have assumed
that paying top dollar for a flat
meant that conrad got someone
who is better at reading people .
yes . well , on second thought , i ..
which is why i &apos;m loathe to parade around
on a goodwill tour with her ,
not to mention her unresolved feelings for aiden mathis .
he &apos;s her ex , too ?
she is determined to make me earn my keep , isn &apos;t she ?
&quot; too &quot; ?
well , i probably shouldn &apos;t tell you this ,
but young emily was married once before .
i beg your pardon .
don &apos;t worry . it was a mistake .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s all there is to it .
one can never be too certain .
she was young . she was in love .
did she happen to mention a name ?
oh , i don &apos;t remember . ronald ...
roger ? i &apos;m sure i have it at the office .
well , perhaps you can do some investigating for me .
and the takedown is all yours , nolan .
i &apos;m sure the grayson &apos;s 4th of july party
will serve as the perfect backdrop , don &apos;t you think ?
let the fireworks begin .
nice to see you . take care .
hey , mom .
quick photo ?
yeah .
okay . well , bizzy &apos;s certainly making this
an event to remember .
she &apos;s documenting every living inch of it .
well , i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be excluding aiden ,
seeing as he dragged your fiance out of lunch today .
emily told you , i &apos;m sure .
i think he &apos;s trying to rekindle the relationship .
do you have to read into everything ?
just try and enjoy yourself .
the who &apos;s who of the hamptons is out in full force .
i &apos;d say we &apos;re a success .
oh , and i have feelers out
for info on husband number one .
speaking of which , i should probably find mine .
why don &apos;t we keep our little fact finding mission
to ourselves , shall we ?
mother ...
you remember sara ?
of course .
oh , ms. munello , i don &apos;t mean to be indelicate ,
but wouldn &apos;t you be far more comfortable
watching the fireworks in the field somewhere ?
well , charlotte was nice enough to let me class it up tonight--
pretend to be the one percent .
of what exactly , dear ?
can i get you a refill ?
&apos;cause i could sure use a drink .
why on earth did you invite that girl back into our house ?
because i care about daniel too much
to see him marry the wrong woman .
and i don &apos;t think emily &apos;s the one to make him happy .
you know i concur in spades , but that doesn &apos;t explain
the need to trot in somebody off the rack .
wake up , mother .
i &apos;m sure daniel still has feelings for sara ,
and she still has feelings for him .
they just need help remembering that .
so you think that sara could be the one who would put a stop to this wedding ?
well , if you weren &apos;t so focused on hating emily
and were more focused on worrying about daniel ,
you might see it , too .
so okay ... proud of me ?
i &apos;d expect nothing more .
bizzy preston ... in the flesh .
nols ?
it &apos;s been ages .
darling , you look marvelous .
likewise , and , uh , who &apos;s the arm candy ?
this is my husband jeff . jeff , this is nolan ross .
mm , of course . pleasure to meet you , nolan .
oh , the pleasure is all mine .
uh ... you dabble in p.r. as well ?
oh , no , no . i let my wife stay in the spotlight .
she &apos;s good at it .
she is dedicated to her clients .
you know , come to think of it , the last time we crossed paths ,
you were a bad girl , outing me like that in the press .
you mean that whole sage thing ?
you &apos;re welcome .
i took you out of the tech pages ,
and i made you interesting to real people .
you did bring out my inner armani .
and besides , who could stay mad at that face ?
you just earned a cocktail .
i wore this for one night as a married man ,
and i &apos;ve worn it ever since to honor you ...
maybe subconsciously to convince people
that i had someone to share my days with , and ...
and nights .
but i don &apos;t anymore .
it &apos;s time for me to try to move on .
i miss you with all my heart .
i &apos;m serious . the orange jumpsuit washed me out .
so i said i preferred the black and white stripes .
they wouldn &apos;t budge .
you are too much .
you two seem to be having a good time .
oh , emily , you are so lucky
to have this one at arm &apos;s length .
well ... god , the trouble you two must get into .
nothing worth publicizing .
um , i was gonna ask you ,
what time is that museum fund @-@ raiser on monday ?
victoria would kill me if i &apos;m late .
as will i. let me check .
where are my readers ?
oh , here , these , uh ... these are mine .
oh , thank you , nols . my little lifesaver .
10 : 00 .
and it is very important that you two put on
a good show , my dear .
i will behave , i promise .
enjoy the party .
thank you .
now , where were we ?
well , i was just about to get , uh , another cocktail .
what &apos;s your poison ?
surprise me .
i &apos;ll see you in a sec . thanks a lot .
of course . hey , see you later .
oh , hi , aron . i &apos;ll see you .
hey , uh , another white ?
no , i &apos;ll take a red .
right away .
thank you , nols , my little lifesaver .
thank you , nols , my little lifesaver .
if it &apos;s a surprise you want ,
i &apos;m more than happy to oblige .
there you go .
nice to meet you .
yeah , i got it .
you &apos;re looking dashing this evening , miss . thorne .
as are you , mr. mathis .
well , i see you two have made peace .
we &apos;re trying , victoria , seeing as you obviously intend
on having us both in your life .
oh , aren &apos;t you kind ?
but don &apos;t do anything on my behalf .
well , that wasn &apos;t part of the plan .
victoria forced my hand .
i had no choice but to be seen with you .
mm , don &apos;t get used to it .
getting chummy with aiden again ?
oh , we &apos;re just at the same party , daniel .
what did he have to say ?
does it matter ?
i &apos;m just making the best of a bad situation .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re jealous .
no .
no , i &apos;m not .
good .
i was gonna go get some food , if you want join .
in a minute . i , uh , got a couple people
i need to talk to .
okay .
word around the party is that conrad grayson
is writing his memoirs . is this true ?
indeed it is . will you excuse us ?
so you &apos;ve decided to discuss your past after all ?
well , you were right . the public deserves it .
i plan to give it to them in my own way .
well , i would love to talk more about it .
perhaps tomorrow morning at my office .
i &apos;m afraid that ship has sailed .
i don &apos;t want mere excerpts for &quot; voulez , &quot; mr. grayson .
no ?
i want your whole book .
have you forgotten lemarchal has a publishing arm ?
well , then tomorrow morning it is .
okay .
look , i &apos;m sorry about the other night .
it &apos;s been a rough year .
i can &apos;t imagine .
look , i haven &apos;t brought it up because i felt
you didn &apos;t wanna talk about it .
i didn &apos;t . that &apos;s ... part of the problem .
but ...
i hope that you &apos;ll give me another chance .
you took off your ring .
what do you say we go watch the fireworks on your roof ?
hey . i brought you a jacket .
hope you &apos;re not hiding from my mother .
she doesn &apos;t scare me anymore .
but , man , does she still try .
yeah , she tends to go all out .
clearly .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t miss this show .
i remember my mom taking us kids out
every weekend during the season to see them on coney island .
yeah , friday nights on the boardwalk .
9 : 30 sharp .
oh , you &apos;ve been ?
best seats in the house are between 10th and 15th
never missed it as a kid .
no way .
of course , i was with my nanny ,
but ... who knows ?
maybe we met once at the hot dog stand .
if you had told me i &apos;d ever be back here
sitting next to you ...
things change .
guess you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re hacking bizzy &apos;s phone here ?
what if somebody saw you ?
what ? i got excited .
plus i waited till she left .
did you get what you needed ?
and so much more .
check out this string of dirty texts
from ms. preston herself .
wait . trevor ?
i thought her husband &apos;s name was jeff .
it is .
seems our dear bizzy has been getting busy
covering up stories of her own .
drink ?
i don &apos;t want us to rush anything .
we can go up and watch the fireworks .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s the 4th of july ,
the day we americans celebrate ridding ourselves
of the british .
but i &apos;m making progress .
i have emily in good graces .
well , your sad attempts at wooing her
have failed to have their desired effect .
daniel &apos;s unconcerned with your renewed relationship .
well , then i &apos;ll change his mind .
oh , but you don &apos;t seem to understand .
i &apos;m declaring my independence .
victoria , you can &apos;t deny
that we &apos;ve made a good team thus far ,
and ... besides ...
you can &apos;t do this alone .
oh , you underestimate me , mr. mathis .
yet another reason why your time here is over .
so if you don &apos;t mind ...
get the hell out of my house .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . victoria &apos;s gone crazy .
she just kicked me out on a whim .
means she &apos;s got something else up her sleeve .
and i &apos;ll be damned if i don &apos;t find out what it is .
just don &apos;t overreact .
i don &apos;t want her to get suspicious .
well , then what can i do to help ?
just go make sure everything &apos;s ready
for when this is done .
come back when the dust settles .
well , at least i get to say good @-@ bye this time .
here you go .
if you want something fancier , i can run downstairs .
oh , do you have an espresso machine ?
no , no , i just meant i can put it in a nicer mug .
okay .
oh , i &apos;m afraid i need to get to the office .
stay for breakfast .
i make a mean pancake .
rain check , please .
no , i &apos;m hearing a book proposal this morning ,
and i imagine conrad grayson waits for no one .
conrad ?
what &apos;s he pitching , a book of lies ?
probably , but that doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t get the real story .
i have a feeling it &apos;s much more interesting
than any of us know .
hi ! great party last night , huh ?
can you believe the graysons are trending ?
oh , i can .
you do anything for your clients , don &apos;t you ?
even if it hurts someone else .
are you still on about that story
i planted in the press years ago ?
you mean the one that nearly destroyed me ?
that left me feeling completely alone ,
that cost me the last ten years of my father &apos;s life ?
yeah . you did that .
so why are you here ?
for payback .
well ... see , at first ,
i was just going to out of your clients &apos; secrets ,
but then i thought , well , it &apos;s not their fault
they have drug and anger issues .
oh , and that , uh , guy with the thing for the diapers ...
how do you know about that ?
that is totally secure information .
little birdie told me .
and then ... sent e @-@ mails
to all your clients ,
explaining how sloppy you are at guarding their sins .
you &apos;ll destroy my career .
ah , well , bizzy , i already did .
and ... now that you &apos;re officially out of business ,
you &apos;re mine .
now if and when i need you ,
i &apos;ll call . otherwise , that phone stays silent .
and that includes sexting trevor vance .
i don &apos;t know who that is .
then why do you visit his house in westport
three nights a week ?
nolan ...
jeff &apos;s ... he &apos;s a good man .
and it would kill him if he found out .
all right .
then i &apos;ll give you a choice--
one that you never had the courtesy to extend to me
all of those years ago .
end the affair ...
today .
go back to the man that clearly loves you .
otherwise ...
i tell him the truth .
i am sorry ... about what happened with your father .
i &apos;ve waited ten years to hear that .
it &apos;s just too bad he never will .
i wanted to apologize for my coldness toward you last night .
it &apos;s a long way to hike
for two words you can say on the phone .
well , then would you indulge me for a few more ?
i know that daniel once fancied you
and that i wasn &apos;t the most receptive to your presence .
you think ?
that &apos;s because i didn &apos;t fully understand
how important his happiness was to me ...
exclusive of my own .
what are you saying ?
that i think that you may be the one for daniel .
daniel &apos;s getting married in a month .
but you must have stopped to wonder
if that was only because he lost you three years ago .
i know that you and i didn &apos;t get along in the past ,
but perhaps we could work together
towards a common goal .
my museum fund @-@ raiser &apos;s canceled .
i imagine i have you to thank for that .
bizzy will be anything but for a while .
thanks .
though when it was time to go in for the kill ,
i couldn &apos;t pull the trigger .
i actually saved her marriage .
guess my takedowns have a silver lining , huh ?
it &apos;s kind of fun being your wingman .
i taught you well , grasshopper .
you know , actually , you did , nolan .
two years ago , i never would &apos;ve thought i &apos;d have
a partner in all this ...
or a real friend .
well , you , uh ...
might wanna wait on our freeze @-@ frame high five .
my glasses accidentally pocket @-@ recorded ...
portions of last night &apos;s party .
allow me to jump to the lowlight .
wait for it ...
that &apos;s why daniel wasn &apos;t upset about aiden .
looks like they &apos;re about to rekindle their past .
then i have to make sure they have no future .
