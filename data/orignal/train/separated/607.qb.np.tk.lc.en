next item is friday &apos;s alumni dance .
how &apos;s that progressing .
i &apos;ve emailed every former student who &apos;s not in prison or jail ,
everyone remember there &apos;s a difference .
our alumni are touchy about that .
what &apos;s the difference ?
you go to jail if a cop doesn &apos;t like you .
they can &apos;t send you to prison without knowing you &apos;re poor .
do you believe half our own politics ?
yeah.yeah.
i &apos;m still trying to find a good dj .
by which i mean figure out what makes a dj good , or bad ,
or different from a phone or laptop .
chang , how &apos;s it going with the powerpoint
for the city council meeting ?
good question .
失望之旅
when you asked if i knew powerpoint ,
i said , yes .
what did i really mean ?
不是 是
these are yeses and nos in the chart .
they appear to be the same .
however ,
i think you &apos;ll find .
that within some eggs is the truth .
that should have been a dollar bill .
but i &apos;m no magician .
i &apos;m just a guy that knows powerpoint .
okay , pushing that meeting .
in other news , campuses across the country including this area
have been seeing a dramatic rise in guerilla marketing .
why did they need marketing , they &apos;re amazing .
that &apos;s guerrilla with a u .
got it .
i &apos;m talking about undercover
advertisers that blend in with the public
while covertly marketing certain products .
they can advertise things without you knowing ?
is that legal ?
it sounds like brain windexing .
it is legal .
it &apos;s mostly harmless , but i would like to protect some of our
more impressionable students from being unduly influenced .
so if you see anything let the dean know .
okay , don &apos;t freak out .
someone just told me that honda has released some kinda
super vehicle called the honda fit .
it &apos;s a small car with a big personality that can handle anything ,
life throws at you .
why am i standing here talking about it ?
i have to find a honda dealer , school is cancelled .
the honda fit is happening .
it &apos;s finally happening .
i &apos;m just going to give this school &apos;s assets a quick freezy wheezy .
is this meeting over ?
i think so , but sometimes we just hang out and say funny stuff .
have fun with that .
guys , do you feel like elroy doesn &apos;t like us
as much as we like him and each other ?
he probably doesn &apos;t know his role yet .
i mean , is he black pierce ,
old troy , or shirley without a giant purse ?
i haven &apos;t exactly been a whirlwind
of entertainment since troy left .
that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s not just me , you guys have been boring too .
okay . i just gotta ask .
what was so special about this troy person ?
did he own a rainbow ?
was he the group &apos;s pharmacist ?
we don &apos;t like to talk about it .
but you often do .
i &apos;m a problem solver give me information .
i &apos;ll handle this .
troy was very gifted at steel drums .
steel drums .
interesting .
well , this has been a great meeting .
i &apos;m off .
that won &apos;t pay off immediately , but it &apos;s gonna pay off .
and that jeff , is the truth .
did you lose the egg you put the dollar bill in ?
that &apos;s how it works ?
第六季 第七集
britta .
remember that guy you were in love with ,
but your love was torn asunder
because he was a human incarnation of certain sandwich franchise ?
sub .
don &apos;t say it .
don &apos;t ever say that name without compensation .
i know how much that experience hurt you ,
which is why i &apos;m warning you
that i just saw him in the parking lot .
breathe , the self destructive part of you
wants to run straight to him ,
but you need to be smarter than that , right ?
right .
thank you annie .
now i have one more class ,
but if you can wait 40 minutes i will meet you .
see i just don &apos;t fling myself into the wild .
the hub of a quality camping experience
is a safe and reliable generator .
you know what i &apos;ll talk to you girls later , right .
stay inventive and enthusiastic .
thank you .
britta .
sub .
no , no , no , no , that &apos;s my sandwich name .
i &apos;m my own man now .
i &apos;m a free , reliable , quality man , named rick .
hi , rick .
that &apos;s for half of my heart .
and that &apos;s for the other half .
and this is for being the reason there &apos;s two halves of my heart .
can you actually crouch down a little bit
cuz you &apos;re taller than my instructor
and i &apos;m only a yellow belt .
no , britta
it took me this long to gain my freedom .
i never stopped thinking about you .
and you touched me in ways no one ever has .
nice .
i came back for you .
you did ?
hey , rick .
look what i got .
great dean .
yeah .
but where &apos;s your honda fit ?
oh , i drive a cr @-@ v.
the fit combines the efficiency of a sub @-@ compact
with the versatility to take whatever life throws at you .
yeah ! that &apos;s what you said !
that &apos;s me !
can the cr @-@ v not take what life throws at it ?
yeah , but the cr @-@ v has durability and storage .
okay , that makes sense .
i bet my bank has a grace period .
i &apos;m going to get a cr @-@ v !
are you guerrilla marketing for honda ?
you &apos;re not allowed to know that .
i &apos;m useless to honda , if anyone knows .
unbelievable .
it &apos;s the same story all over again .
i disagree .
you know , i think it &apos;s a whole new story .
i have a beard now and an identity .
selling hondas is just my job .
and they make great products that i &apos;d wanna sell , anyway .
so can you have a girlfriend ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
then , see you around as a friend .
as friend , britta ,
can i at least show you
the cr @-@ v &apos;s easy fold @-@ down 60 @-@ 40 split row seat ?
for 15 minutes .
then , friends for real .
great news .
the steel drum thing paid off ?
we invited elroy to meet us in the study room for a game night .
he said , yes . yeah !
are you gonna play pretty please , will you like us more ?
that &apos;ll warm him up .
better . in celebration of elroy &apos;s
life peaking in the early 90s ,
the ears have it .
the classic game of whose ears you have , which ears have it ,
and whether you have those ears .
we &apos;re work @-@ shopping new hand shakes .
you guys realize it &apos;s just reinforcing his aloofness .
if you want someone to like you , you don &apos;t get to know them .
you sit back and wait for them to notice you &apos;re cool .
what are you ? 13 ?
what &apos;s the age allowance on the ears have it ?
seven and up .
then i &apos;m six .
i must say , you &apos;ve become more reliable and durable .
i hope we could do this again .
no , rick , i want a normal relationship .
i want to experience brunch in public .
i want a non @-@ financial reason to text my parents .
i want to tell another person how to dress .
we can have a relationship ,
we just have to follow a few simple rules .
rick ?
are you in there ?
you have to hide .
the windows are fogged over .
are you napping heavily ?
i can &apos;t hide forever .
no , but you can hide in comfort .
there &apos;s 35.2 cubic feet of cargo space back here .
please , britta .
dammit .
come on , come on , come on , come on .
why choose , when you can hond @-@ oose .
oh , and that blower that was just an impulse buy .
wow , dean , you know , one vehicle &apos;s enough for one person .
i guess i know that in my head ,
but i can &apos;t shake this fear
of losing even one small part of what honda has to offer .
my god , you &apos;re level seven susceptible .
what ?
nothing . nothing , i- .
look , rick , whatever that is , you can tell me .
i &apos;m on board .
yes .
yes , you are .
am i found in africa ?
yes , and san diego , and the bronx .
a woman ?
am i large ?
am i elepant ?
i was thinking dolphin ,
but i knew they didn &apos;t have ears
because my dentist has a poster of one on the ceiling ,
and i recently had a root canal .
hey , party people , i could hear you all the way down the hall .
we &apos;re playing the ears have it , chang &apos;s ahead by three pair .
with an asterisk .
i &apos;m cheating .
hey , you can have my spot .
i should , i should leave .
oh , no , well , fun hanging out with you elroy .
we know you have your choice of friends
and we thank you for choosing us .
easy choice to make .
see , told ya .
elroy doesn &apos;t like us , what are we gonna do ?
you guys are goofs .
yeah , we were silly .
i got up to make nachos
and elroy said , that was not @-@ cho job .
and we laughed .
then he made them for me .
it was more than word play .
it really wasn &apos;t my job in his eyes .
i hadn &apos;t seen that side of him until now .
he had a great time .
till jeff showed up .
maybe he just doesn &apos;t like jeff .
okay , my deal .
boston rules .
two up , one down .
elf ears are wild , joker ears are regular ears .
ears go cold once they &apos;re off the head .
rat ears are an automatic loss .
no sneaking , sniffing , or grunting ,
and no asking do i have lobes .
chang &apos;s ahead by three pair .
with an asterisk .
it &apos;s not true , you know .
oh , it is . i cheat my ass off at everything .
i &apos;m cheating at a game of hide and seek right now .
we weren &apos;t supposed to leave the rec center .
okay , let &apos;s do this .
extra cards .
stupid sink !
every time !
mother .
i hate .
no rush .
what do you need ?
a club soda please .
how about a little something in there to keep it company ?
what do you recommend ?
well , scotch and soda &apos;s is a classic .
this one &apos;s okay .
we just got this one in .
it &apos;s got a pig on the bottle .
but this one , this one &apos;s really good .
aged eight years .
smoky .
from scotland .
a little pricier but worth it .
i drink this one when i &apos;ve got a reason to celebrate .
then i will take that one .
i think i &apos;ve got something to celebrate .
oh , yeah , what &apos;s that ?
she &apos;s good .
what are you doing here ?
britta , this is my boss .
from honda ?
in public you &apos;ll refer to us as hilary from now on .
continue .
there &apos;s a program we can be in ,
where we covertly market as a team ,
we can be a couple in a relationship in public .
we can walk down the street holding hands .
if i take a job tricking people
into buying things they don &apos;t want .
do you enjoy billboards and commercials , miss perry ?
you mean shill @-@ boards and con @-@ mercials ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i detest them .
they are unmanned bulldozers
rolling over everything in their path .
what rick does is surgical .
he finds that part of each life that honda can improve
and gently bathes it in the most helpful information possible .
i don &apos;t think , you understand how surgery works .
i came in here to get a club soda .
right now , i am drinking probably ,
the best scotch i &apos;ve had in years .
did you trick me ?
am i suffering ?
do you love this man ?
i do .
then i pronounce you a highly influential couple .
you may kiss your boyfriend .
wait , where &apos;d he go ?
whoa , that &apos;s not for us to understand .
well , okay , but he &apos;s right there .
hi , todd .
hey guys .
mind if we sit with you ?
oh , yeah , that would be great .
i have to say , you guys seem very happy together .
hm , we have our moments .
i &apos;m excited because we &apos;re going antiquing this weekend .
i love antiquing .
everything is so old .
i like it too .
you said you hated it .
i hated finding these treasures
and not being able fit them in the car .
now i got a cr @-@ v.
cr @-@ v ?
yeah , rick &apos;s new honda .
he won &apos;t shut up about it .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of a game changer .
certainly a sex life changer !
sorry , for being obnoxious !
so what you &apos;ve been up to ?
i don &apos;t remember .
cr @-@ v you say ?
cr @-@ v.
cr @-@ v.
you &apos;re amazing .
you &apos;re amazing .
honda &apos;s amazing .
i want you to meet my parents .
yes .
honda .
look , britta &apos;s in love .
yup .
he must be a very special young man .
i bet they &apos;ll be together for a very long time .
man you got him pegged , man , pegged .
hey jeff .
hey , here you can have my seat .
i &apos;m just going to class .
oh , wait , before you go ,
i know you have every one of natalie &apos;s freezing cds ,
but abed found some songs by them online
that they did for a charity album for homeless skateboarders .
plastic doll parts , wall paper chrysalis , weird blanket .
i never heard these .
this is great , thanks .
stay away from that mechanic .
unless i need wrench made of licorice .
oh , man , i &apos;m , i &apos;m sorry .
man , i &apos;m like a fart to that guy .
he can &apos;t get away fast enough .
what ? no , i mean , maybe .
what the hell happened at that ears game
that made him like you so much ?
a few brief moments of human vulnerability .
not really your wheelhouse .
oh , i &apos;m sure you have detailed files
on human vulnerability , abed .
whoa , take a knee , man .
he &apos;s right , jeff .
if you want elroy to like you ,
maybe you need to put yourself out there .
you mean bribe him ?
with gifts ?
like your natasha freezes cd ?
natalie &apos;s freezing .
natalie &apos;s freezing .
natalie is freezing .
natalie is freezing .
natalie is freezing . natalie is freezing .
what is this ?
i don &apos;t know , i.
i don &apos;t know .
honda .
the power of dreams .
dean pelton , i know how susceptible you are to advertising .
would you say , i &apos;m a level seven susceptible .
no , because why would i ?
because that &apos;s moon man talk .
you mentioned a new kid earlier ,
who told you about the new honda fit .
rick .
britta &apos;s boyfriend ?
yeah , but he &apos;s not .
no .
he &apos;s a good man .
and he wouldn &apos;t secretly be working for honda ,
because when we first met
he was secretly working for completely different company .
are you ... i don &apos;t know how to ...
i have a rule about being constructive ,
so i can &apos;t ask any questions right now .
because all of the questions i have right now are rhetorical
and they end with the word idiot .
do you know what a rhetorical ...
no , of course you don &apos;t know what that is ,
you &apos;re an idiot .
i &apos;m sorry , i am so sorry .
but you &apos;re so stupid .
you have no idea .
and you &apos;re the only one who has no idea , because guess why ?
don &apos;t answer that , you &apos;ll get it wrong .
so dumb .
you &apos;re just a dumb little man who tries to destroy this school
every minute .
i am sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh it &apos;s okay .
i mean it &apos;s not okay , but shh , shh , shh .
oh , so stupid .
oh shh , shh , shh .
such a dummy .
we are just so thrilled that you brought a friend .
thrilled .
and , and it is friend then ?
i mean is that the correct moniker ?
boyfriend .
hello .
this is , well that &apos;s , whoa , this is very exciting .
boy you could just bowl me over with one of those sweet heart ,
you know what are the , you remember at the johnson &apos;s cabin , we .
feathers .
you could blow me over with a feather .
well , you have a lovely home .
i love this carpet .
it reminds me of the quality floor mats in my honda cr @-@ v.
oh , come on sweetie that &apos;s not necessary .
you refer to your floor mats as quality ,
i &apos;ve never heard that level of floor mat enthusiasm .
should we be caring more
about our floor mats , george ?
i don &apos;t think we should jump to conclusions , deb .
just let the man finish his story .
they &apos;re floor mats .
that &apos;s the story .
hey , what &apos;s this ?
what &apos;s that ? look all around .
there &apos;s things all around us .
would you like to see a movie ?
we have one . what is it , george ?
it &apos;s it &apos;s the the aviator .
no , no , it , the avatar .
no thank you , that movie is three hours of puke .
of course , britta &apos;s joking .
we enjoy avatar very much .
we do ?
yes , it &apos;s an immensely popular movie .
of course , we love it .
how many alumni have responded ?
not many .
but i think our current students
will show up for the degree raffle .
how about we put the dj over there ?
you &apos;re not gonna need a dj .
i &apos;ve been saying that since the invention of the shuffle button .
i have booked a surprise musical guest this evening .
a little piece of 90s nostalgia
you might call natalie is freezing .
are you out of your damn mind .
what ? you know this band ?
you know damn well i do .
why do you always wha , what ,
what , are you trying to get me to like you ?
no .
good , cuz it aint &apos; working .
you weird , hair gelled , cpr dummy .
it &apos;s pomade .
as long as i &apos;m up here , does anyone want anything reached ?
hey , we &apos;re natalie is freezing .
oh , are you natalie ?
i &apos;m julie . the name of the band is natalie is freezing .
why would anyone in the band be natalie ?
we &apos;re artists .
cool .
so , our dj was going to man the frozen yogurt machine .
is that something you guys can handle ?
if you do need anything reached , i &apos;ve been practicing .
we like avatar ?
in public , yes .
we like things most people like .
our job isn &apos;t to alienate people .
we &apos;re on the job with my parents ?
with everyone , everywhere , all the time .
you wanted a relationship .
a real one .
it &apos;s real .
do you not think , honda makes good products ?
of course , i do .
that &apos;s never been remotely in question .
but , why does that mean that i like avatar ?
because you &apos;re not a monster .
right , cuz people don &apos;t want to drive what a monster drives .
stop the honda , rick .
do you hear me ?
use a light press of your foot engage the highly responsive
anti lock brakes of this incredible vehicle , now .
i want to be with you , the real you .
this is me .
this is what i do .
when i influence people to buy honda products ,
i feel god &apos;s pleasure .
that &apos;s from chariots of fire .
i love chariots of fire .
so do i.
also we have to .
dammit britta .
oh man .
you people are everywhere .
i was looking for a place to hide .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not gonna bother you .
okay then , give me a gin and tonic .
your friend jeff booked natalie is freezing for the dance .
what ?
tonight ? we gotta go .
why aren &apos;t you excited ?
i used to date her .
really .
her name is julie .
why would the bands name be her name ?
she &apos;s an artist .
we &apos;ve listened to them together .
you never said anything about this .
she messed me up , she messed me up pretty good .
here &apos;s to forgetting .
not gonna toast to that .
well , then forget you too .
give me a break .
that &apos;s the whole problem .
everybody &apos;s in such a rush to protect themselves from each other .
sure . yes , you gotta defend your castle , but you also gotta .
what &apos;s that thing that castles have ?
walls .
come on .
a moat .
it goes over the moat , goes over the moat .
enemy knights , cavalry arrows ?
no , come on . stop it .
it goes like this .
alligators ?
no , it &apos;s one thing .
it &apos;s mechanical .

i don &apos;t even know what the hell you &apos;re talking about .
it &apos;s one mechanical thing .
it goes over the moat .
it goes like this .
a catapult !
oh , jesus ! what , what are you doing ?
britta .
i love you .
i &apos;m gonna quit honda .
i &apos;ll get a job i , i , i don &apos;t know .

oh , wow what do we do now ?
my school &apos;s having a dance tonight .
my favorite band is playing .
let &apos;s go !
okay !
a drawbridge , a drawbridge .
you need a drawbridge .
it &apos;s elroy &apos;s favorite band too .
i once , i once hallucinated one of their music videos in his rv .
that &apos;s weird .
no , the dean can &apos;t introduce the band tonight .
he &apos;s in his office deciding what kind of vehicles to buy
for the athletic department .
yeah , he needs a whole fleet .
that &apos;s right a fleet of vehicles .
he just needs to pick a model of car . he &apos;s in his office .
did you hear that ?
yes , i heard it ,
rick , but we &apos;re out of the game .
not yet .
we can leave on a high .
the dean is a level seven susceptible , britta .
it &apos;s a one @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime feeling , you won &apos;t believe it .
i do believe it , but i don &apos;t need it .
do you ?
i &apos;ll just do this one last job ,
then we &apos;ll be free .
be right back .
guess i &apos;m a level seven susceptible too .
why do they assume somebody is named natalie in the band ?
it , it like happens all the time .
like , remember we were in syracuse ?
elroy ?
julie , you messed me up .
you came after me because i wasn &apos;t interested .
you got me interested , and i fell hard .
then you got bored and destroyed me .
and i &apos;ve been afraid to love anybody for 20 years since ,
but not anymore .
okay .
i still love you ,
but i &apos;m not gonna keep on hurting others ,
just because you hurt me .
fine .
fine .
that &apos;s you . that &apos;s my impression of you ,
you jaded hipster a @-@ hole .
i still love your music .
have a great gig .
elroy , i &apos;m tired of playing this game .
i like you and i want you to like me .
okay .
you &apos;re a good guy , jeff winger .
you and i are gonna be friends .
okay , great , whatever .
i love you .

yes , good dean .
smart dean .
he &apos;ll be fine .
but he can never come back here .
i understand .
of course if , you want to come with us .
because you are good .
i had nothing to do with it .
the 2015 honda cr @-@ v sells itself .
