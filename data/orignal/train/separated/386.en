你想试驾一下吗
That's a 2.4 liter 6 cylinder engine.
with Hitachi sidedraft carbs.
That's right.
Wanna take a look under the hood?
Yeah!
You know your Z. I'm impressed.
You should have your mechanic check it out anyway.
Thank you.
So it's just... right up here.
What are you doing?
Okay.
Stop the car now.
Pull over now!
Let's call him... Sergio.
Ha ha! Please tell me you're kidding.
It's hebrew. Look what it means.
It's perfect. Gideon Hotchner.
The winners sit. Losers, drink.
Cheers.
Trust me... we cover the whole spectrum of psychos.
We do terrorists, arsonists--
Excuse me.
Were you with him in Boston?
I was supposed to be.
Yeah. This is Morgan.
Anyone recognize these faces?
Victims of the footpath killer.
[联邦调查局 弗吉尼亚州 匡提科]
I told Virginia P.D...
Works a menial job.
Where'd the murders occur?
Hiking paths. Isolated.
even out in the middle of nowhere,
I lack confidence.
like Ted Bundy did.
Excuse me.
Seattle's hit a wall?
And another girl is missing.
You're gonna be with us in Seattle asap.
22-year-old Heather Woodland.
They want you back in the saddle.
You ready?
Looks like medical leave's over, boss.
They sure they want me?
The order came from the director.
Well, we'd better get started.
Joseph Conrad said,
We want an assessment.
Are we clear?
Of course.
He stabbed her...
So he stabbed her instead.
Becoming a better killer.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
[华盛顿州 西雅图市]
He never stands with his back to a window.
Morgan, it's been 6 months. Everything's ok.
This is special agent Gideon,
special agent Reid.
Dr. Reid.
Dr. Reid, our expert on... well, everything.
i hope you all remember me.
He's willing to travel with the body.
On purpose.
So you wanna see our suspect list?
It keeps our perspective unbiased.
Agent Gideon, where would you like to start?
Let's start at the site of the last murder.
The one who caught that guy, Adrian Baal, in Boston.
Nails clipped just like the others.
He wants them to fight back.
But not enough to hurt him.
And he left the belt around her neck.
He's probably in his early 20's.
What's your reasoning?
Youthful arrogance.
He clothed the body before dumping it.
That's a sign of remorse.
It's not consistent. Look where we are.
They're disposable.
It's what we call the Reid effect.
Happens with children, too.
You look too young to have gone to medical school.
They're PhD's. 3 of them.
Are you a genius or something?
I don't believe that intelligence can be accurately quantified--
Yes, I'm a genius.
Sandy, you get a lot of attention, don't you?
Yeah, Heather loves this dog.
Not sense. Smell.
Sandy's worried because she knows you are.
David, does your sister drive a Datsun Z?
Come on, Sandy.
If I want to coax a young woman into my car...
Offer her a test drive.
But the autopsy protocol says what?
He doesn't want 'em looking at him, apparently.
All right, enough.
Let's tell them we're ready.
We're ready?
Reid. You're good with this?
We've got a woman who's only got a few hours left to live,
They don't call them nervous breakdowns anymore.
He's someone you wouldn't notice at first.
He's someone who'd blend into any crowd.
petty crimes. Maybe auto theft.
Psychopathic as opposed to psychotic.
He follows the news, has good hygiene. He's smart.
The murders have all involved rapes.
and that tells us he's sexually inadequate.
Psychiatric evaluations will show a history of paranoia
stemming from a childhood trauma--
death of a parent or family member.
And now he feels persecuted and watched.
Murder gives him a sense of power.
Organized killers have a fascination with law enforcement.
They will inject themselves into the investigation.
That makes them feel powerful, in control.
Which is why I also think...
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.
and the lights weren't working.
Richard. Richard, get down here!
Hello?
You are under arrest for the murder...
Emerson said,
is another riddle."
but we won't be able to hold him.
Slessman's been at the top of the suspect list.
Is that the mother?
Grandmother. The mother died in a fire when he was 13.
Probably not the only fire in his childhood.
Exactly how much is a multitude?
Luring him out was your idea, right? Greenway?
Hotch says your background is in sex offender cases.
What can you tell us?
He'll keep a victim for a couple of days.
You ok with Hotch being in on the interview?
Slessman's done time,and he knows the process.
And all you will get now is a demand for a lawyer.
Next time, show a little leg.
Seriously... I want that opening at BAU.
We're missin' something.
Something's not right about this.
This is a boy's room... not a man's.
Log in password.
No, no-- wait, wait!
It was a false password.
Chairman Mao required his generals to learn it.
It also looks like he's playing himself.
How can you tell?
This might provide an advantage, actually.
There are profiles for every player
The conservative point counter, the aggressor, the finesser.
What kind of player is Slessman?
Extreme aggressor.
Okay, here we go.
What's the number 6 at the bottom of the screen?
There could be an email, or a journal in the computer
Something that tells us where Heather is.
Do you think you can break in?
In 6 tries?
Try not.Do or do not.
Yoda.
I wanna talk to him.
You read my paper. Learn anything?
You said he was lying,
You have an academic interest in disassociative identity disorder,
Or you just planning your defense?
You a fan of Adrian Baal's work?
No.
I'm a fan of yours.
You know...
They never give you the real facts about CPR...
That outside of a hospital, it's only effective 7% of the time.
Your friend had a 93% certainty of dying,
But you kept trying... even after you'd broken his ribs,
Why don't you tell us where Heather Woodland is?
Woodland...
Isn't she the girl that went missing a couple days ago?
Get him out of here.
He is "isn't she the girl..."
She's alive. We don't know for how long.
What is it?
Conflicts in the profile.
There's a second killer.
A second unsub.
Its' not unusual.
1979. They outfitted a van to rape
They're not equals.
Slessman's smart, but he is a submissive personality.
Probably not as smart as Slessman.
He's like the schoolyard bully recruiting a good underling
He'll be protective of Richard.
He'll make him feel like he owes him.
This guy showed him how to do it.
He helped him take the first step.
No, no. We need leverage.
That'll take too long. There's gotta be a faster way.
There is.
Here. This might be a little hot.
Mrs. Slessman, I don't think we've got the right guy.
There's gotta be someone.
Hey, it's Morgan. Need you to work me some magic here.
I got a program called Deadbolt Defense
And a girl with only a couple of hours to live,
Deadbolt's the number one password crack-resistant software out there.
You're gonna have to get inside this guy's head to get the password.
I thought I was calling the office of supreme genius.
Well, gorgeous, you've been rerouted to the office of too friggin' bad.
Thanks anyway.
Well, there was... there was this one young man.
I think his name was Charlie.
Cross-reference Charlie for the second unsub.
Charlie is probably Charles Linder.
He was Slessman's cellmate and...
Received a dishonorable discharge from the military.
My name is Richard Slessman, and I have trouble sleeping.
Okay, what do I do when I'm trying to get to sleep?
Guys, a little help.
Does senior management want a field assessment on Gideon?
What's the address?
Don't think it matters anymore.
Winston Churchill said,
Anyone who can tell us more about Slessman?
Car accident, 2 months ago.
Linder is dead.
Too bad you guys came here for nothing.
I mean, talk about scum.
You protect them?
If you're a little white guy?
Especially in a prison like this.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for your help.
What's he doing?
And I want you to write the name on the sides.
Whose name?
4 months of investigative work,1 file,
And guess what, Richard.
It's not your file. See, we don't care about you.
It's Vogel we want.
Oh, come on! I need a password. I need a password.
Think we may have missed the obvious.
What are you doing?
Reid, what made you think of this?
It was the only empty case.
What song could possibly speak to me?
"Enter Sandman."
And it's so powerful that we'll...
and you need to protect him.
Guys like Vogel learn in the schoolyard
which kids to bully and which kids to protect,
that you'll go to jail for him.
Richard, I'm here to remind you something.
You owe him nothing.
There's something wrong.
We gotta pull him over. I can feel it.
Impatient.
You wanna stop him, you give me a reason.
He's slowing at yellow lights.
This is not someone who is rushing to kill and dump a body.
Okay. Do it.
Get out!
What are you doin' driving his car?!
He asked if he could borrow my truck.
'Cause we're watching her right now.
Yeah.
Right there.
Yeah, what about it?
like the earth is tilting.
Not the earth, doc. The ocean.
She's on a boat? Where?
It's a pier or a dock.
He wouldn't be able to transmit the webcam image from the middle of the ocean.
What is it you always ask Garcia?
To work me a little magic.
and Vogel's nailing you to the wall.
Yeah, whatever.
He's talking, Richard.
Reciprocity.
Is it a dock?
A pier?
It's a shipyard.
Allied shipyard.
Reid, he's inside.
Get Elle on the phone.
You told me to trust my instincts.
Stop!
Get... back!
Shoot me instead.
Come on. What, are you a lousy shot?
I know all about ya, Tim.
It is physical.
What did the girls call you in high school?
I got it. Tiny Tim.
Gideon!
Go look after the girl.
So what kind of report do they want on him?
Guess what Gideon means in hebrew.
Mighty warrior.
Appropriate.
What would you say?
Gideon saved her life.
That's good enough for me.
You and Haley pick the baby's name yet?
It's funny... Haley liked the name Charles,
There's just too many of them.
How's your report going?
You know, you saved that girl today.
It's a good thing.
Nietzsche once said,
the abyss looks into you."
I'll take this.
Have a n-i-- n-nice day.
