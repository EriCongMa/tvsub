aren &apos;t you both going to the museum thingie ?
spencer got the tickets for me and ezra .
please , just don &apos;t go tonight , okay ?
i have a bad feeling about this date .
i think that bad feeling is called jealousy .
they had a big opening at the philadelphia art museum .
you went last night ?
why is he out of jail ?
he &apos;s out on bail .
why don &apos;t you save us the cost of a trial and drop dead !
you &apos;ll have to do more than
break records if you wanna become team captain .
who said i wanted to become captain ?
what the hell ? !
i take care of things myself .
you remember that phony your sister used to date ?
ian thomas ?
we partied that whole summer .
he &apos;s the poster boy from preppy .
convincing , isn &apos;t he ?
so you wanna give it back to your teacher
or put it on your charm bracelet ?
what is that ?
it &apos;s what stopped mrs. montgomery from getting to philly .
who &apos;s this from ?
paige .
she &apos;s trying to bribe her way to becoming the next team captain .
do you think they &apos;re from the same place ?
these two were purchased by a spencer hastings .
does that help , dear ?
ah , so it &apos;s just gonna be you and your brother tonight ,
and he wants to order in from sausage heaven .
again ? seriously ?
dad , the closest thing they have to a vegetable is a paper plate .
listen , just tell mike
that it &apos;s your night to pick , okay ?
okay . so you &apos;re definitely not eating with us ?
uh , no , no , i--i &apos;ve got this thing .
it &apos;s with the head of the department ,
and dinner &apos;s included , so ...
have a great day , sweetheart .
oh , hey , dad ,
i need your pledge for the dance marathon .
the deadline &apos;s today .
oh . oh , right . that &apos;s right .
uh , my checkbook is in my jacket in the hall .
did you find it ?
what ?
um , yeah .
great .
dad , what &apos;s this ?
well , that &apos;s a ticket for the museum .
is it yours ?
no , no , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s your mother &apos;s .
uh , her car broke down ,
and she needed to borrow mine to get there .
so she was at the museum on thursday night ?
yeah .
i--i mean , i--i think so .
you know , actually ,
you should really just talk to your mom about that .
here you go .
is my chemistry book over there ?
uh , i don &apos;t see it .
it &apos;s probably in the room , spence , not the frontyard .
what happened to the cavanaughs &apos; mailbox ? somebody hit it ?
it &apos;s not the first time , and i &apos;m sure it wasn &apos;t an accident .
every time i come home ,
toby &apos;s out there cleaning up some new mess .
and please don &apos;t say he deserves it .
i wasn &apos;t gonna say that .
is that it ?
thanks .
do you still think that somebody framed him ?
toby ? do we really wanna have this fight right now ?
i have to save up some of my energy for swim practice .
we &apos;re not on different sides anymore , em .
i mean , i know what it feels like to have somebody
say that you did something when you know that you didn &apos;t .
are you talking about the bracelets ?
i &apos;d never seen that bead lady before that day ,
and yet she had my name written down on two sales receipts .
we should go . we &apos;re gonna be late .
i owe you an apology .
seriously .
you believed that he was innocent from day one ,
and i jumped down your throat .
i said some really heinous things about toby .
you shouold apologize to him , not me .
hey .
hey . cute boots . new ?
oh , ish .
what is with this line ?
all the vending machines are on lockdown .
someone &apos;s been breaking into them after hours and stealing food .
i heard this one kid say the alarm went off at like 3 : 00 a.m.
what , the vending machines have alarms ?
school .
someone &apos;s been sneaking out of the building
in the middle of the night , which makes zero sense .
who &apos;d wanna be here any longer than they have to ?
hmm , well , i might . going home just got scary .
this was in my dad &apos;s coat .
he said it &apos;s my mom &apos;s ,
but i &apos;m starting to wonder if he was at the museum , too .
your dad ? no .
why was he so twitchy when i asked ?
if they both were there the same night as me and ezra--
aria , you &apos;re just on a loop .
it was a coincidence .
is it ?
han , come on , you don &apos;t think it &apos;s weird
that my mom had a ticket the same night ?
yes , a weird coincidence .
um , can you get my coffee ? i &apos;ll be right back .
we need to talk .
you know that thing you did with mrs. montgomery &apos;s car ?
well , just pretend like it never happened , okay ?
don &apos;t talk about it , don &apos;t blog about it ,
don &apos;t tweet about it . clear ?
can i speak now ?
okay , if you must , but it &apos;s really annoying .
the way i see it , you owe me .
for what ?
for doing that thing i can &apos;t talk ,
blog , or tweet about .
was there a second watch ? was anyone else keeping time ?
it was a tie , paige . you and emily tied .
so what &apos;s gonna happen ? who gets to anchor tomorrow ?
can &apos;t make that decision yet .
all right , listen up , sharks .
we &apos;ll meet tomorrow morning , same place , same time ,
and have ourselves a little swim @-@ off .
so , i guess we &apos;ll just figure this out tomorrow .
you figure it out . i need to win .
aria . hi , sweety .
hey , mom .
your ears must &apos;ve been burning .
why ?
i was just talking to the principal about you and mr. fitz .
why ?
well , he wants to take your class
to new york to see the fitzgerald show ,
but the principal told him there was no money .
do you wanna walk with me ?
sure .
what &apos;s up ?
so dad wrote me a check this morning for the dance marathon .
okay .
and when i got to his checkbook ,
i found the ticket that was yours to the museum .
i guess it was in dad &apos;s car .
you didn &apos;t mention you borrowed his car .
oh , no , well , i didn &apos;t think i had to .
why , did you have it on reserve for the night ?
no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m just confused .
did you go to that exhibit or not ?
well , to be perfectly honest , no .
i skipped it , and i went out to a really nice dinner instead .
by yourself ?
no , uh , i was with a friend .
i gotta get to class .
i &apos;ll see you later .
are you reading that fast or fanning yourself ?
what ? um , sorry .
where you going ?
um , i left my lip gloss in the history stack .
gotta find it .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m calling in your debt .
two losers just bailed on what they owe me ,
and i need some cash right now .
okay , so what do you want me to do ? bust their kneecaps ?
i don &apos;t want an enforcer .
i want a date .
okay , absolutely not .
you &apos;re the homecoming queen , hanna .
you got a certain rep around here ,
and i need to borrow some of your cred .
what are you gonna do with it ?
i need customers ... with money ...
who need to know they can trust me .
yeah , well , they can &apos;t .
they can if i &apos;m with you .
so you got a hot party tomorrow night ?
i have a swim meet .
you can fit all of that under a cap ?
i &apos;m not swimming , freak . i &apos;m cheering on a friend .
what is the point of a swim @-@ off ?
why would the coach pit you against each other before a meet ?
she &apos;s using our combined times to choose anchor ,
and right now , we &apos;re tied .
well , you &apos;ll change that .
maybe not . she wants it more .
emily , you want it more ,
and it is okay to admit that .
寻求法语三的交互辅导
you know who that &apos;s for , don &apos;t you ?
toby ?
what are you doing ?
i might be interested .
spencer , don &apos;t . you can &apos;t .
why not ?
because you &apos;d be going there for the wrong reason .
really ? well , what if the same person who gave my name to the bead lady
is the one who framed toby ?
what if that was &quot; a &quot; ?
can &apos;t you find that out some other way ?
without asking him ?
who else knows what he knows , emily ?
if i can get him to talk--
you won &apos;t even get him to look at you .
he doesn &apos;t trust us .
he doesn &apos;t trust anyone anymore .
maybe , but if i have one piece
of the puzzle and he has another ,
then we can put it together and maybe help each other .
you &apos;re a little early .
i just wanted to tell you
i &apos;m not coming to practice today .
why not ?
i have another commitment .
you know , why don &apos;t you come in . close the door .
i can &apos;t stay . i &apos;m--
no , come in .
what are you trying to pull here , spencer ?
are you gonna tell your parents you can &apos;t stand to be
on the same field with me so you &apos;re quitting the team ?
i &apos;m not quitting the team . i just have this other thing .
you can &apos;t avoid me .
i live in your backyard .
well , this isn &apos;t about you . i &apos;m ...
look , i &apos;m too concentrated in athletics ,
and it doesn &apos;t look good on my college applications .
so i just need to balance out my schedule .
knock @-@ knock .
sorry to interrupt .
i thought you had a marketing seminar .
oh , the professor cancelled . i brought the tile samples .
the contractor needs a decision .
oh , great .
bye .
yeah , i think your sister &apos;s quitting the team .
why ?
i &apos;m not quitting the team .
i &apos;m just doing some tutoring .
well , anyone in particular ?
toby cavanaugh .
what ?
what ?
i signed up to help him with his french .
i can &apos;t believe the school
would let anyone near him , especially alone .
why are you doing this ?
i already told you .
what is this really about ?
that kid murdered one of your best friends .
wait , don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re falling for that silent martyr crap .
okay , you can &apos;t believe a thing that creep says .
well , toby cavanaugh hasn &apos;t cornered the market on lying .
i better to go .
hi .
i--i noticed this was on the ground
as i was walking up .
wait , i &apos;m here to tutor you .
someone from the school called to tell you , didn &apos;t they ?
why you ?
because i &apos;m in a.p. french ...
and i volunteered .
look , i have all your assignments together ,
and i worked out a schedule for the rest of the semester .
if we meet for three times a week , we can--
you can &apos;t come in .
jenna &apos;s home .
okay .
well , is there somewhere else we can go ?
i--i can &apos;t go somewhere else .
well , will jenna mind if we sit out here on the porch ?
just don &apos;t think about it . it &apos;ll make you crazy .
how am i supposed to not think about it ?
it &apos;s too freaky . if my mom &apos;s car hadn &apos;t stalled--
well , it did .
don &apos;t look a gift card in the mouth .
the universe gave you a pass .
that &apos;s not the universe i know .
well , look , it all worked out , okay , and that &apos;s what counts .
maybe the universe got a little help from someone--
someone with really good intentions .
shh .
that &apos;s great . i can pick you up .
i can find you in the dark . i &apos;ve done it before .
okay , i &apos;ll see you soon . bye .
hey .
so you &apos;re not going to that department dinner anymore ?
oh , no , no .
was that mom you were talking to ?
uh , no , no , no , it wasn &apos;t .
so you sure you guys are gonna be okay here alone tonight ?
sure .
ok .
okay , look , aria , even if it wasn &apos;t the universe--
shh .
i &apos;m just saying if it &apos;s not a coincidence , then maybe--
come on .
where are we going ?
to follow my dad .
where ?
if i knew that , we wouldn &apos;t have to follow him .
aria ...
han , my dad &apos;s about to have dinner
with somebody in the dark . move it .
i brought you something .
l &apos;attrape @-@ coeurs .
the heartcatcher ?
it &apos;s catcher in the rye .
i guess there &apos;s no literal translation ,
but it helps to read a book you already know in english .
how do you know i &apos;ve read it ?
i saw you once ...
at the apple rose grille .
you were reading it .
what are you doing here ?
uh , mr. carinci wants you to review
the conditional tense and the workbook--
what do you want ?
what makes you think that i want something ?
because you never do anything without a reason .
did emily tell you that ?
nobody had to tell me that .
i think maybe you &apos;re being framed .
what changed your mind ?
i think somebody might be trying to do the same thing to me .
maybe the same person .
how &apos;s that feel ?
not good . scary .
why would somebody go after you ?
what makes you so important ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe you know something you &apos;re not supposed to know .
well , every time i think i know something ,
i get the rug pulled out from under me , and i end up on my ass .
c &apos;est dommage .
c &apos;est la guerre
i &apos;m sorry ...
for what i said about you
and what i thought .
the sweater with alison &apos;s blood ...
you said that you gave it to her that night .
i did .
and then she got into a car .
with some guy .
i couldn &apos;t see who it was .
i &apos;m not supposed to talk about this .
do you know how the sweater could &apos;ve gotten back into your house ?
uh , i have to go .
thanks for the book .
yeah , you &apos;re welcome .
what are your thoughts on genetic modification ?
aren &apos;t scientists playing god ?
how will it affect human health in the long term ?
so i &apos;m against it .
he &apos;s different .
how ?
i meant , he &apos;s different than i thought he would be .
&quot; how have humans altered the
genomes of species for thousands of years ? &quot;
through artificial selection .
there &apos;s something about him that &apos;s ...
i don &apos;t know .
wow .
a question spencer hastings can &apos;t answer ?
interesting .
it &apos;s not that interesting .
am i finished with your homework ?
you are .
thank you .
i keep trying to find a connection .
to toby ?
to alison and toby .
me and toby .
we &apos;re pretty sure he didn &apos;t do it , right ?
and yet somebody found a way to make him look extremely guilty .
spence , you can &apos;t figure all that out
sitting on his porch , conjugating verbs .
well , you don &apos;t know what those verbs are .
if he didn &apos;t tell you the first time , he probably can &apos;t .
are you sure he even wants you to come back ?
yeah , i think he does .
why is my dad walking into our high school ?
okay , weird .
not really .
i mean , think about it . he &apos;s probably just going to see your mom .
em , that &apos;s ridiculous .
people lie , aria .
i mean , hello ?
well , what are they doing ?
call your mother .
huh ?
right now . call your mom .
hi , aria , honey . i was just thinking about you .
is everything okay ?
yeah . why wouldn &apos;t it be okay ?
uh , well , i didn &apos;t mean to suggest
that everything wasn &apos;t okay .
i was just asking , checking , wondering ,
like moms do .
where are you ?
home .
shh . where are you ?
home .
okay , so everything &apos;s okay then ?
yeah .
okay , i &apos;ll talk to you later , sweetie . bye @-@ bye .
bye .
okay , well , she says she &apos;s home .
do you believe her ?
i don &apos;t know .
what are you doing ?
that &apos;s not good .
mm . what ? you used to like it .
no , no , not that , this--
the lying , the sneaking around .
i feel like a teenager .
yeah , it &apos;s fun , isn &apos;t it ?
listen , we should just tell the kids .
we can &apos;t . we can &apos;t tell them until we know what this is .
okay , i think i got everything .
let &apos;s go .
watch out for that .
oh , my god , my parents are having an affair with each other !
hanna ? hanna ?
what are you doing ?
come up here .
hurry !
what are you looking at ?
this .
someone sending a bunch of texts ?
spencer &apos;s laptop disappearing ?
our lockers broken into ?
all this stuff happened at school . this is &quot; a. &quot;
let &apos;s just get out of here .
come on .
hanna , you &apos;re taking that ?
yes , &quot; a &quot; owes me--
hospital bills , pain and suffering ,
tire marks on my cleavage .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s nothing .
the lights are probably on a timer .
we should go .
come on !
caleb ?
how &apos;s your eye ? any better ?
it &apos;s still burning .
you want a sharp stick for the other one ?
it was just hair spray . it was light hold .
what were you doing in there anyway ?
i &apos;m sort of , um ...
i &apos;m crashing here .
you are ? why ?
what do you care ?
don &apos;t snap at her like that . i have more .
fire away .
just give me my money back first .
where do your parents think you are ?
my foster parents don &apos;t care where i am ...
as long as they keep getting their checks .
wait , i thought all that stuff
about the social worker was a joke .
believe me , my social worker is a joke ,
but , yeah , i do have one .
this is crazy . you can &apos;t keep staying here .
why ? there &apos;s hot water , vending machines ,
the principal &apos;s couch is pretty comfortable .
well , they know someone was here last night .
yeah . i got sloppy .
where are you going ?
grab some dinner , then back to bed .
you know your way out , right ?
paige ?
are you okay ?
no .
what happened ?
you have every reason to hate me .
i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m here .
i don &apos;t hate you .
i would .
i do .
don &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m sorry , emily .
i just wanted you to know that .
wait , paige ...

so let &apos;s make it a good one .
oh , emily , there &apos;s not gonna be a swim @-@ off .
i just got word that paige will not be joining us .
why not ?
she had an accident while riding her bike last night .
she &apos;s just a little banged @-@ up .
she &apos;ll be back swimming in no time .
okay , ladies , in the water , in the water ! come on !
you &apos;re late . let &apos;s go in .
wait , can we talk about last night ?
what is there to talk about ?
um , the fact that you &apos;re hiding out in the a.v. closet until graduation .
what &apos;s your plan ?
all right , do you wanna play guidance counselor
or do you wanna pay off your debt ?
i &apos;m cashing in on that favor .
point out the kids who have money to burn .
fine , i &apos;ll trade you--
one name for one answer .
oh , hey , bridget .
hey , hanna .
you know my friend caleb , right ?
sort of .
hey .
bridget wu-- total party girl .

why don &apos;t you report your foster parents ?
to who ? my social worker ?
i &apos;ve had four in the last six months .
they can &apos;t remember my name .
the last one called me &quot; calvin . &quot;
when &apos;s the last time you saw your real parents ?
it &apos;s gonna take a lot more than names to hear about them .
truce . got you a button .
thanks .
no problem .
i need to be super rah @-@ rah now that i &apos;m the coach &apos;s wife .
it &apos;s a swim meet . it &apos;s not even his sport .
and what &apos;s yours , brother @-@ in @-@ law bashing ?
what &apos;s going on between you and ian ?
why don &apos;t you ask him ?
something wrong with that picture ?
i see my husband buying us hot dogs ,
and i see you going out of your way to humiliate him .
what was that lying crack about ?
he does nothing but try with you , spencer .
when are you gonna give him a break ?
honestly ?
when i figure out why he rushed back to rosewood
and rushed into proposing to you .
no , you &apos;ve got it wrong .
i proposed . i wanted to elope .
you have a problem with my marriage ,
you take it up with me , not him .
well , him is the problem .
he &apos;s not been entirely honest with you ,
and i &apos;m worried about you .
about what ?
you have to ask him about alison ,
about what happened the summer that she was killed .
you really are too much .
did toby cavanaugh put that idea in your head ?
hey . sorry i took so long .
they were out of the spicy mustard you like .
did i miss something ?
no , we were just talking about alison .
ian , i &apos;ll meet you inside .
okay .
look , i &apos;ve already lost one relationship because of you .
you will not ruin my marriage , too .
melissa .
coming .
when &apos;s emily gonna jump in ?
she &apos;s the anchor . she swims last &apos; cause she &apos;s the fastest .

thanks . i &apos;ll be right back .
come on , come on , come on !

hanna , i like stray dogs , too ,
but sometimes they bite .

she &apos;s not swimming yet .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna take the long way home .
okay , i &apos;ll see you later .
bye .
问问汉娜 -a
what &apos;s this ?
my eviction notice .
sorry .
you know that i didn &apos;t tell anybody .
i didn &apos;t go there .
well , maybe it &apos;s for the best .
i mean , the place had small closets .
i hated that shirt anyway .
consider your debt paid .
have a good day .
hey , if you need a place to stay--
no , thanks .
your mom starts asking questions ,
someone calls social services ,
and it &apos;s just a big mess .
wait .
there &apos;s an old couch in my basement .
my mom will never know .
hanna . hey . here you are .
you &apos;re not gonna believe what this sick freak did now .
what are you talking about ?
look .
问问汉娜 -a
i have to say , &quot; a &quot; is smart--
trying to pit us against each other .
yeah , aria ...
it &apos;s relentless .
every time we shut a door , &quot; a &quot; kicks open a window .
i gave your mom the museum ticket .
what ? why would you do that ?
&quot; a &quot; made me do it . &quot; a &quot; has something on me .
&quot; a &quot; has something on all of us , hanna ,
but there &apos;s nothing &quot; a &quot; could
threaten me with that would make me do that to you .
you &apos;re supposed to be my best friend .
i know , and as soon as i put the ticket in your mom &apos;s mailbox ,
i did everything i could to undo it .
the reason your mom didn &apos;t get--
stop talking .
there &apos;s nothing you could say
that would change the way i feel right now .
you okay ?
you didn &apos;t return any of my calls .
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s nothing .
i didn &apos;t know what to say .
i was riding home on my bike and totally wiped out .
what were you thinking about ?
how easy thing &apos;s would be if i wiped out .
i &apos;m kind of done with swimming .
yeah , i used to feel that way .
obviously you got over it .
how did you get over it ?
i started swimming for myself .
i quit trying be better
than everyone on the team , and i just relaxed .
sounds fun .
when &apos;s the last time you swam for fun ?
hey .
hi , i got your message ,
but i didn &apos;t totally understand .
this isn &apos;t going to work .
here , take it back .
toby , i came here because
i thought that we could help each other .
we can &apos;t .
just take it and go .
question .
what &apos;s up ?
um , the towels in the bathroom--
are they like the fancy people @-@ are @-@ coming @-@ over towels ?
no , you can use them .
i don &apos;t have to .
i can shake off and air dry .
please don &apos;t .
what &apos;s going on ? you want me to leave ?
it &apos;s not about you .
aria &apos;s really , really mad at me .
you know that thing i told you not to leak ?
she found out anyway ?
she &apos;s never gonna speak to me again .
you don &apos;t have to sit here and listen to this .
just go take your shower .
it can wait .
good night .
wait , spencer .
can we talk about earlier ?
no .
it &apos;s late , and i &apos;m tired .
i know about you and ian .
he told me everything--
the thing you two had when we were broken up .
i can &apos;t hold that against you .
did he tell you anything else about that summer ?
whatever it is you &apos;re holding onto ,
it &apos;s got to stop .
i think he &apos;s dangerous .
and i think you need help .
you keep wanting what i have .
you know what , melissa ?
spencer , i don &apos;t want to fight .
i realize that i lost my temper earlier , and i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve been a little hormonal lately ,
and i guess i should tell you .
tell me what ?
we &apos;re pregnant .
this is where you say , &quot; congratulations . &quot;
good night , sis .
