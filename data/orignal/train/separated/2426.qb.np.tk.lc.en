love brought me to mystic falls ...
i love you , damon .
... love drove me away .
silas .
hello , my shadow self .
and just when we thought we were safe ...
our enemies took everything from us .
i &apos;m not ready to be dead yet , jeremy .
i can tell everybody that you &apos;re with family .
i might not be able to touch you , but i &apos;m here for you .
our lives ...
what are you doing to my brother ?
frying silas &apos; brain .
stefan , we missed you .
i have no idea who you people are .
and even our memories .
&quot; march 12 , 1922 . i blacked out for days .
&quot; i wake up in a stranger &apos;s blood
&quot; in places i don &apos;t recognize
with women i don &apos;t remember . &quot;
&quot; i feel alive again . &quot;
all right . i think i &apos;ve read enough .
nada ?
i know &quot; nada &quot; means nothing .
i know what day it is , i know what year it is ,
i know this car has a v @-@ 8 engine ,
and yet i am two journals deep ,
and i have absolutely no memory of who the hell i am .
well ...
and is this supposed to fill me up ?
well , yes , and no .
technically yes because you &apos;re a vampire .
weird .
realistically no because you &apos;re , you know , you .
ahh , yes .
the insatiable and blood @-@ lusting vampire ripper of monterrey .
and we &apos;re only in the 1920s , baby .
well , sorry , but this is a lot to process .
you &apos;re a vampire , not a cave man .
so let me get this straight .
i helped you steal this car ,
i found out i was a vampire who killed his own father ,
and yet i don &apos;t litter ?
you &apos;re a man of principle , stefan ,
who had his memories erased by a 2,000 @-@ year @-@ old witch .
yeah . well , i bet that 2,000 @-@ year @-@ old witch
probably drives a little faster than you .
wait . let me guess . fun brother ,
safe brother .
what are you doing ?
do you trust me ?
do i really have a choice ?
nope .
i got it . you &apos;re the fun brother .
please tell me i wasn &apos;t out of my mind
leaving damon in charge of vampire amnesia 101 .
what did he say exactly ?
one text-- &quot; so far , so good , &quot;
which in damon speak ...
means that they probably devoured a troop of girl scouts by now .
caroline .
i &apos;m kidding ... kind of .
although it &apos;s not uncommon for patients with retrograde amnesia
or other traumatic brain injuries to turn volatile .
ok , dr. forbes .
since when do you know so much about amnesia ?
it &apos;s possible i studied up on my chem , biochem , applied microbio ,
molecular bio , and &quot; gray &apos;s anatomy , &quot;
the real one and the television show .
you did all of that for stefan ?
of course i did .
i &apos;m also trying to impress dr. maxfield .
i figured if i could get closer to him ,
i.e. into his biology class ,
maybe i could figure out why he covered up
our roommate &apos;s murder by vampire ,
and it &apos;s also possible that i have a study buddy .
hi , dr. maxfield .
are you ready to go study , jesse ?
jesse ? dr. maxfield &apos;s incredibly hot , funny ,
and miraculously single lab assistant ?
i &apos;m dragging him to our hometown graveyard bell @-@ ringing ceremony .
as in creepy first date ?
as in a study date .
while i &apos;m there , i might as well ring a bell for tyler and me
considering our relationship is on its death bed .
see you monday , doc .
stay out of trouble .
will i see you there ?
you could bring stefan .
i mean , it is ironically called remembrance day .
i hope so , i really do .
it just depends on how stefan &apos;s handling
the whole download of his dark and stormy past .
all right . well , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
to uncle steve !
uncle steve !
this town always so upbeat about dead people ?
well , in the theme of morbid town tradition ,
you go back to the 1820s when everyone was so paranoid
about the cholera thing
that they would occasionally bury a body
a wee bit before its time .
so we have a holiday dedicated to burying people alive ?
well , they were so paranoid that they would actually request
to be buried with a string attached to a bell above ground ,
and then the whole family would hang around the grave
for 24 hours in hopes of hearing the bell
and that their loved one would come back ,
but now it &apos;s just really-- it &apos;s a really kick @-@ ass excuse
to get hammered .
hello .
uh , hey , darling . we &apos;d love another round , please .
you got it .
yeah .
what the hell was that ?
that , my brother ,
was you jonesing for something a little stronger than a blood bag .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
you spent the whole day trying to convince me i was a vampire .
i &apos;m convinced . let me act like one .
well , unfortunately , stefan ,
there are two types of vampires in the world , ok ?
there are those that can handle moderation ,
and then there &apos;s you .
well , i &apos;m no shrink .
right ?
right .
but maybe killing our father and turning into a vampire
and all the trauma associated with that
is what made me become a vampire who feeds on people
and then rips their heads off ,
but now that i don &apos;t have all those memories
and all that guilt ,
maybe the ripper thing won &apos;t be such a problem .
let &apos;s not try it out , ok ?
and here i thought catching up
on nearly two centuries would be a drag .
remind me of your name again .
elena .
elena . right .
you haven &apos;t told him about me ?
200 years is a long time .
right . well ...
don &apos;t stop on my account .
sorry . i , uh ...
i just went for a run . what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s not like there &apos;s netflix where i am .
you working out is my main source of entertainment .
i was just working off the extra adrenaline .
and every girl on the other side thanks you for it .
so is this our new thing ,
you make dead jokes while i avoid all of our friends on your behalf ?
there &apos;s nothing i can do to get stefan &apos;s memory back , jeremy .
but they don &apos;t know that
because they don &apos;t know you &apos;re dead .
they &apos;re waiting for you to help them because that &apos;s what you do .
you help .
what happened to you being there for me in my decisions ?
i want to , bon ,
but not like this .
hey , jer .
you got a sec ?
um , i &apos;m kind of freaking out here .
yeah . yeah . what &apos;s going on ?
so i woke up last night covered in mud
with this .
ok . weird .
yeah , i know .
i have no idea where it came from .
i blacked out ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure that it &apos;s not the first time .
how many times have you died wearing the gilbert ring ?
no . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s the gilbert ring that &apos;s messing with me .
no . like , it &apos;s got to have something to do
with why silas couldn &apos;t mind control me .
he saw something or someone
or whatever that czech freak put in my head ,
but i think it &apos;s still there .
what &apos;s with the camera ?
i set them up all over the house
to help me figure out how i &apos;m losing time .
have you talked to bonnie ?
i think that she &apos;s the only that might know what &apos;s going on here .
yeah , yeah . she &apos;s in d.c. with her mom or something .
so she can &apos;t pick up ?
i sent her , like , 300 e @-@ mails this summer ,
and she writes back twice .
did i do something to piss her off ?
i don &apos;t know . she hasn &apos;t mentioned anything .
jer , look . i need you to help me get in contact with her , ok ?
i haven &apos;t slept , ok ?
i &apos;m scared i &apos;m going crazy here .
i need her help .
i got to go .
what ? where ?
so mr. so far , so good ,
mr. i can handle my brother ,
mr. i know what i &apos;m doing .
hey . i never said i know what i &apos;m doing .
who are you calling ?
bonnie .
a witch did this to him .
maybe a witch can undo it .
i &apos;m on top of it , sister .
i &apos;ve called her about 10 times .
she hasn &apos;t called me back .
look . i say until she does ,
let &apos;s just let stefan be stefan ,
fun , carefree , drunk stefan
without 100 years of vampire guilt on his shoulders .
that guilt came from a blood addiction
that might still be hard @-@ wired in his brain .
you take one philosophy class ,
now you &apos;re the queen of nature versus nurture ?
hey . where &apos;d he go ?
you don &apos;t see that cute , little waitress anywhere , do you ?
don &apos;t scream .
don &apos;t move .
i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
you seem really nice .
it &apos;s not like i want to rip your head off ,
but i keep being told that if i have one taste
i won &apos;t be able to stop ...
and although the thought of killing you
scares the hell out of me ,
this feeling of hunger that i have inside of me
is just so much more powerful .
today , i &apos;m the safe brother .
what kind of name is honoria fell ?
shh . you &apos;re kind of the one that killed her .
hindsight being 20 / 20,
way too much temptation at the bar ,
so if this ripper gene is biological ,
then we need to minimize human contact
wntil we get your brain all witchy @-@ wooed back to normal ,
so here it is .
so this is the family crypt , huh ?
anybody here i didn &apos;t kill ?
well , we &apos;ve covered our father , who art in hell .
uncle zach , my bad .
on the bright side , our mother died of consumption .
oh , good .
i got to go see a man about a witch .
party on without me .
brother ...
for you--
and this is for you .
well , i , uh , i certainly hope your family history was happier than mine .
well , let &apos;s see .
in the last 3 years ,
i lost my adoptive parents , my birth parents ,
my aunt , our guardian alaric ,
and my brother jeremy died ,
although he came back to life ,
so there &apos;s that .
wait . jeremy that lives in our house ?
yeah . after i had a breakdown and burned my house to the ground .
what ?
how do i not remember you ?
i mean , you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re pretty , you &apos;re funny .
obviously , you &apos;re the strongest woman in the world
if you managed to figure out a way to get through all that .
i surround myself with amazing people who help me through it .
like you .
you &apos;re one of those people
so bonded by death ?
please don &apos;t tell me that we met in a cemetery .
really ? we met in a cemetery ?
well , no officially , we met somewhere else first ,
but , um , you want to see ?
yeah , sure .
hello ?
jeremy gilbert picks up .
wow . it &apos;s a remembrance day miracle .
now tell me you found bonnie
because i have a hungry vampire
who forgot that he &apos;s the hero of the story .
i need you to come meet me ,
and i need you to come alone .
and i need you to be less vague and less weird .
i know where bonnie is .
get over here , and i &apos;ll explain .
anything ?
no . sorry .
actually , i think you were coming from that direction
because i remember looking that way ,
so maybe if we switch .
sure .
right .
this is where we collided .
let &apos;s try again , shall we ?
hey , elena . as frustrating as it is
for me not to have any memories ,
i really don &apos;t think that re @-@ creating the time we met
is magically gonna bring it all back .
yeah , i know .
right . i &apos;m sorry . i ...
it &apos;s just that seeing you like this is so ...
strange .
i &apos;m strange ?
you were the one coming out of the men &apos;s bathroom .
do i even want to know why ?
let &apos;s just say that i was having
a pretty horrible first day .
i want to show you something . come on .
yeah , sure .
come on !
close your eyes .
you close your eyes .
come on , stefan . trust me .
all right .
all right . you can open them .
the view &apos;s great ! come on up .
how the hell do i get up there ?
jump . just push off with every ounce of strength that you have .
ok .
all right .
well , i have to admit that was , uh--
that was actually pretty amazing .
you &apos;re the one who whooshed me up
to the top of a ferris wheel once
before i was a vampire .
right . you mean , when we dated .
i thought damon hadn &apos;t gotten to that part .
i may have amnesia , but i &apos;m not an idiot .
i &apos;m 164 @-@ year @-@ old vampire who went back to high school ,
so i &apos;m guessing that had something to do with you .
and obviously we &apos;re not together anymore ,
so i have a feeling me ripping people &apos;s heads off
might have been a little bit of a turn @-@ off .
actually , no .
you were the most compassionate person i &apos;d ever met .
you hated the idea of hurting anyone .
the guilt would overwhelm you .
you were always in control .
so i bored you to death ?
no . stefan , it wasn &apos;t you .
it was me .
becoming a vampire changed me .
how &apos;d you become a vampire ?
why don &apos;t i show you ?
meet me down there ?
ok .
togavirus . go .
togavirus causes congenital rubella ,
whatever that is .
ok , hot shot .
red queen theory .
a theory often used to explain
the contradictory relationship between predator and prey .
and why does the supposedly weaker species
always stay one step ahead ?
fear of extinction .
the rabbit is faster than the fox
because the fox is chasing its dinner .
the rabbit &apos;s running for its life .
damn . if maxfield doesn &apos;t let you in ,
you can have my spot .
how did you learn all that so quickly ?
well , whenever anyone tells me i can &apos;t do something ,
i prove them wrong .
is that why you invited me here ,
to prove to your boyfriend you don &apos;t need him ?
i don &apos;t know where my boyfriend is .
that would require communication ,
and mutual interest and respect .
and i invited you here because you &apos;re smart ,
and you &apos;re nice ,
and , i don &apos;t know ,
i just kind of wanted to hang out with you today .
i think that guy is doing a keg stand
on his granddad &apos;s grave .
what ?
uh , sorry . i &apos;ve just kind of wanted to do that since move @-@ in day .
aplastic anemia . go .
aplastic anemia .
ok .
where is she ? call her . get her here .
that &apos;s the problem .
i can &apos;t actually call her .
no one can .
please don &apos;t do this , jeremy .
i &apos;ve been lying to everyone for months ,
and i can &apos;t keep lying knowing that everyone &apos;s waiting for her
to swoop in and save the day .
i don &apos;t speak crazy person , jer .
you &apos;re gonna have to translate that for me .
think about it , damon .
i was dead .
i wasn &apos;t supposed to come back .
yes , exactly . the beauty of bonnie magic ,
which is what we need right now .
you &apos;re not hearing me .
magic finds a balance .
i &apos;m not supposed to be here .
no .
you can &apos;t just bring somebody back from the dead .
there is always a price to pay for it .
don &apos;t say it , jeremy . don &apos;t you dare .
she didn &apos;t show up to her dad &apos;s funeral , damon .
nobody has spoken to her all summer .
please , jeremy .
you say it , and everything in elena &apos;s life goes to crap ,
do you understand me ?
everything changes .
do not say it , jeremy .
don &apos;t .
bonnie &apos;s dead .
damn it , jeremy !
you realize what you just did ?
why would you say that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
people need to know .
how is it cosmically possible
to get into to accidents on the same bridge ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe it was fate
drawing me back ,
saying that i cheated death the first time .
but if i was there both times ,
then why didn &apos;t i save you both times ?
because the second time you saved my best friend matt ,
because i asked you to .
ah . got it . so i &apos;m an idiot .
no . you were the perfect boyfriend .
you valued what i wanted even if it wasn &apos;t what you agreed with .
well , it &apos;s gonna take me a minute to wrap my head around that .
fair enough .
it &apos;s working , you know ?
you &apos;re remembering ?
no . i mean , this , whatever we &apos;re doing ,
the distracting , the sublimating ,
whatever you want to call it .
the urge to feed has settled .
i &apos;m not , uh , hungry anymore .
good .
whatever monster i was capable of being
i could see why i was different around you .
you were never a monster .
elena , i saw my reflection in the mirror today .
i was scared of me .
well , you never scared me .
the first time i saw you for what you were ,
i touched your face like this ,
and i told you not to hide .
don &apos;t .
i &apos;m with damon .
you &apos;re with my brother .
and neither of you thought that was
something that i should know ?
we weren &apos;t hiding it from you .
it &apos;s not that ...
i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
and just like that , the hunger returns .
i &apos;m sorry , stefan .
hello ?
dekuji , kristof .
what the hell ?
hello ,
matt donovan .
i &apos;m the passenger inside you .
i know you have many questions , but
all you need to know ,
is that one day ,
my friends will come looking for this blade .
protect it at all costs ...
or this will be your throat .
where are you ? i &apos;ve been calling .
i &apos;m at home .
look . i really need to talk to you about something .
damon , stefan &apos;s gone .
what ? what happened ?
i told him about you and me ,
and he just-- he stormed off .
and said that he was hungry .
damon , there &apos;s an entire graveyard full of people here tonight .
ok . i &apos;m on my way .
stefan ?
caroline forbes .
my best friend .
what , you recognize me ?
well , i &apos;ve studied pictures .
you are much hotter in person .
sorry . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m a little drunk .
yeah . yeah . i can see that .
are you ok ?
well , if by ok , you mean
heavily spiraling into ripper oblivion .
then yes , i &apos;m dandy .
keg stand guy passed out ,
so i stole these .
hey . do you mind just giving us a couple minutes ?
yeah . it &apos;s probably a good idea .
because i can sense from here that you have a paper cut
on the palm of your left hand .
and i want to rip your entire arm off .
stefan !
go away , hide . i &apos;ll find you .
look . i know that you &apos;re hungry ,
but you don &apos;t do people , ok ?
it just--it doesn &apos;t end well .
what about blood bags ?
do you have any blood bags ?
yes . in the car . come with me .
hey , caroline . it &apos;s jesse .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , but for some reason ,
i &apos;m in a crypt in the cemetery ,
and i have no idea why .
there .
that wasn &apos;t so bad , was it ?
i did it . i stopped .
i don &apos;t know what you are , man , but--
oh , i &apos;m a ripper .
you know what that means ?
that means i literally can &apos;t stop feeding
until i rip someone &apos;s head off .
but look at us .
we &apos;re working it out .
let me out of here , please .
i know i should let you out .
i &apos;m good , right ? i &apos;m compassionate .
i live with this burning hunger inside of me
that allows me to stay in control ,
but what do i have to show for it , huh ?
i don &apos;t know you , man .
i have no memories because my brain was fried .
my brother , who &apos;s been my brother for 160 @-@ some @-@ old years ,
stole my girlfriend ,
and my girlfriend let him ,
so you tell me
what &apos;s the point of being good ?
i &apos;ve been knocking .
yeah , i noticed .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this , but--
matt , wait .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
it &apos;s about bonnie .
what ? is she back ?
what , jer ?
hey ! stefan , stop !
this isn &apos;t you , ok ?
you might not remember , but i do .
you are better than this .
you are not this person .
i have to go .
what ?
i have to leave .
stefan .
oh , my god .
jesse , jesse , drink this .
you &apos;ll be ok .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry i got you into this ,
and i &apos;m sorry i let you kiss me when i--
i &apos;m just sorry .
stefan , there you are .
we &apos;ve been looking everywhere for y--
what you doing there , brother ?
well , you know , just tying up a few odds and ends .
you sure you want to do that ?
well , i know what i don &apos;t want .
i don &apos;t want to be the person in these journals anymore .
i don &apos;t want to live in this house .
i don &apos;t want my brother &apos;s advice .
i don &apos;t want to hear
how i supported you , elena ,
and i definitely do not want to continue this conversation .
stefan , wait .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not gonna go on a ripper binge .
besides , caroline said she &apos;d call me every hour
to make sure i was ok ,
and , uh ...
i actually do trust her .
but ...
i think we just got dumped .
we need bonnie .
why hasn &apos;t she called us back ?
it &apos;s so unlike her .
he can &apos;t stay like this .
elena , bonnie can &apos;t help us .
did you talk to her ? what did she say ?
there &apos;s got to be something that she can do .
i mean , she &apos;ll figure it out .
she always does .
bonnie &apos;s dead , elena .
what ? !
she &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey . how you feeling ?
i &apos;m feeling better ,
which in my world means
i haven &apos;t committed a homicide since i last saw you .
i &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking today ,
a lot of wandering around ,
and this seemed like the most appropriate place to come .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s bonnie .
my friend , our friend .
she &apos;s dead .
what--what happened ?
please don &apos;t ask because then i &apos;m going to
have to try to come up with an answer ,
which means i &apos;m gonna have to actually think about it ,
and then i &apos;ll start crying ,
and i &apos;m afraid that i might not ever be able to stop .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i wish that i could remember her .
i don &apos;t know .
part of me just wishes that i could trade places with you .
because without all the memories ,
maybe it wouldn &apos;t hurt so damn much .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m never gonna see her again ,
and i have no idea where tyler is ,
and i just got so used to them being there all the time ,
and now what ?
i &apos;m supposed to just learn to move on without them .
how do i do that when all i have is this sadness
and this anger and--
me . you have me .
look . you were there for me last night .
sounds like you &apos;re always there for me .
so let me be there for you , ok ?
i don &apos;t have any clothes .
i have nothing to wear .
i mean , i burned my house down
with all of my funeral clothes in it .
i &apos;m supposed to be strong ,
i &apos;m supposed to have learned how to handle this ,
but ...
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t keep doing this , damon .
stefan &apos;s gone , bonnie &apos;s dead .
she gave up her life so that i could have my brother back ,
and i didn &apos;t even know about it .
i know .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
they need this .
i need this .
we ring this bell in honor of bonnie ,
in remembrance for her .
i &apos;m not sure what else to say .
say that i &apos;m not going anywhere ,
say that even though they couldn &apos;t see me
i &apos;ve been there the whole time .
she says that she &apos;s not going anywhere ,
that she has been here all along .
bonnie has watched you have the summer of your life .
... the summer of your life ...
and i saw you happy ,
and i know you think now
that you can &apos;t have a normal life ...
the you have to be here for everyone .
but you don &apos;t .
everyone will find their way ,
so you are gonna repack your things ,
you &apos;re gonna go back to college ,
and you &apos;re gonna live it up .
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong , matt .
you know i would have sent you
300 e @-@ mails back if i could .
i miss you .
caroline .
caroline .
i watched you decorate that dorm room
like your life depended on it .
and i know that college isn &apos;t
everything you expected
and that you feel like something &apos;s missing ,
but ...
tyler .
this is good .
this is all i wanted .
i &apos;ll be ok .
we &apos;ll all be ok .
your vitals are normal .
don &apos;t sound so disappointed .
tell me about your night .
caroline forbes took me to a party in mystic falls ,
and then ...
it &apos;s kind of a big blank .
i must have been really drunk .
what &apos;s causing your memory loss didn &apos;t come in a red cup .
it appears you have vampire blood in your system , jesse ,
which means you were either injured
to the point of needing to be healed ,
or someone wants to turn you into a vampire .
i &apos;m guessing the former ,
and then i &apos;m guessing you were compelled to forget .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
it &apos;s nothing to worry about .
the good news about having vampire blood in your system
is that &apos;s step one to creating a new vampire .
