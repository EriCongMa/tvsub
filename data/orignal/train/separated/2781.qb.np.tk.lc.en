ugly naked guy is decorating his tree .
you should see the size of his christmas balls !
how much did you tip the super ?
we were gonna give 50 , but we don &apos;t wanna look bad .
this year we made him cookies .
and 25 it is .
you gave cookies ?
money is so impersonal .
cookies says someone cares .
we &apos;re broke , but cookies do say that .
i can see that .
a plate of brownies told me a limerick .
pheebs , let me ask you something . were these &quot; funny &quot; brownies ?
not especially .
but i think they had pot in them .
so who else did you tip with cookies ?
the mailman , the super ....
and the newspaper delivery guy .
oh , my god .
what ?
you &apos;re not gonna like this .
these are cookies smashed to the sports section .
he did my crossword puzzle .
yeah , but not very well , unless 14 across , &quot; gershwin musical ... &quot;
... actually is &quot; bite me , bite me , bite me . &quot;
the one with phoebe &apos;s dad
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s christmas already .
one day you &apos;re eating turkey , the next thing you know ...
... iords are a @-@ leaping and geese are a @-@ laying .
which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year .
hey , guys .
hey , rach .
i got you a little present .
i &apos;ll open it .
it &apos;s a slinky !
remember ?
walks downstairs alone or in pairs
everyone knows it &apos;s
just a big spring .
you &apos;re still mad because of the whole
horrible list of reasons not to be with me ?
how about we just call it the &quot; unfortunate incident &quot; ?
hey , gunther . you got stairs in your place ?
go nuts .
hey , guys .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
some presents .
come on , show us what you bought .
you know you want to .
this is a picture frame from ben to my parents .
oh , that &apos;s cute .
some &quot; hers &quot; and &quot; hers &quot; towels for susan and carol .
and i got this blouse for mom .
ross , that is gorgeous !
look at these authentic fake metals !
mom &apos;s gonna be voted &quot; best dressed ... &quot;
... at the make @-@ believe military academy !
happy &quot; christmas eve &quot; eve .
oh , my god ! where did you get this ?
macy &apos;s , third floor , home furnishings .
this is my father !
this is a picture of my dad !
that &apos;s the guy that comes in the frame .
no , it &apos;s my dad . i &apos;ll show you .
i thought your dad was in prison .
no , that &apos;s my stepdad .
my real dad &apos;s the one that ran out on us before i was born .
how have you never been on oprah ?
look , see ? this is him .
my mother gave me this picture before she died . same guy !
this is a picture of the frame guy ...
... posing in front of a blue screen with a collie .
it &apos;s not a blue screen . it &apos;s just ....
maybe it was just really clear that day .
okay , i have to talk to my grandmother .
wait a minute , honey !
i &apos;m trying to get my boss &apos;s ex @-@ wife to sleep with me .
but when phoebe has a problem , everyone &apos;s all ears !
esther livingston .
gone !
hi , pooh .
hi , gram . what you doing ?
just updating the phone book .
gram ?
can i see the pictures of my dad again ?
sure , sure .
how come ?
just , you know , to see him .
sure . here .
this is the one of your father in a meadow .
and helping a little boy fly a kite .
and here he is at a graduation .
another graduation .
another graduation .
is this really my father ?
is it really your fa ?
well , of course it is .
i smell smoke . maybe because someone &apos;s pants are on fire !
in all the years we &apos;ve been grandmother and granddaughter ...
... you &apos;ve never lied .
all right , that &apos;s not your father . it &apos;s a picture of a guy in a frame .
oh , god .
it was your mother &apos;s idea .
she didn &apos;t want you to know your real father ...
... because he hurt her so much .
i didn &apos;t want to do it .
but then she died and it was harder to argue with her .
not impossible , but harder .
all right . so he &apos;s not a famous tree surgeon ?
and i guess he doesn &apos;t live in a hut in burma where there &apos;s no phones ?
last i heard , he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate .
that makes no sense .
why would the villagers worship a pharmacist ?
honey .
anyway , that &apos;s all i know .
that ...
... and this .
this ...
... is the real him .
i remember my father all dressed up in the red suit ...
... the big black boots and the patent leather belt ...
... sneaking around downstairs . he didn &apos;t want us to see him ...
... but he &apos;d be drunk , so he &apos;d crash into something and wake everybody up .
that doesn &apos;t sound like a very merry christmas .
who said anything about christmas ?
anyone hear from phoebe yet ?
no , nothing .
i hope she &apos;s okay .
i know exactly what she &apos;s going through .
how do you know that ?
she told us .
what do you got there , monica ?
stuff for the party .
aren &apos;t you guys supposed to be shopping ?
you didn &apos;t buy presents yet ?
tomorrow &apos;s christmas eve ! what are you gonna do ?
don &apos;t you have to be claymation to say that ?
i don &apos;t think the mailman liked your cookies .
the ornaments your mom sent .
maybe the mailman liked the cookies . we just didn &apos;t give him enough .
monica , pigeons learn faster than you .
hey , rach .
i think i know what will make you feel better .
how about you make a list about me ?
forget it . i &apos;m not gonna stand here ...
... and make a list
okay , you &apos;re whiny ...
... you are obsessive , you are insecure ...
... you &apos;re gutless .
you don &apos;t ever just &quot; seize the day . &quot;
you liked me for a year and you didn &apos;t do anything about it .
and you wear too much of that gel in your hair .
see , there ....
all right , you did what i said .
and you know what ? you &apos;re right . i do feel better .
thank you , ross .
yeah , in albany . could i have the number of frank buffay ?
okay . in lthaca ?
all right , saratoga ?
oneonta ?
you know what ? you shouldn &apos;t call yourself lnformation !
hello , grandma . if that is , in fact , your real name .
come on now , pooh . don &apos;t still be mad at me .
how &apos;s it going ?
not so good .
upstate &apos;s pretty big . he &apos;s pretty small . you do the math .
well , i think you &apos;re better off without him .
oh , honey , i know he &apos;s your daddy .
but to me , he &apos;s still the irresponsible creep ...
... who locked up your mom and stole her gremlin .
i know . i just wanted to know who he was , you know ?
yeah , i know .
i wasn &apos;t completely honest with you when i said i didn &apos;t know ...
... exactly where he lived .
what do you mean ?
he lives at 74 laurel drive in middletown .
if you hit the dairy queen , you &apos;ve gone too far .
you can take my cab .
thank you .
nobody else drives that cab .
got it .
i &apos;m gonna see my dad !
thank you .
wish me luck , grandpa .
phoebe here with the cab yet ?
yeah , she brought the invisible cab .
hop in !
she &apos;d better get here . the stores close at 7 .
it &apos;ll be two hours to phoebe &apos;s dad &apos;s house ...
... they &apos;ll meet , chat , swap life stories .
even if she tells the one where she &apos;s an egyptian slave , we &apos;ll have time .
hey , here she comes !
can you believe this ?
in , like , two hours i &apos;m gonna have a dad .
yeah , big stuff !
okay , let &apos;s go !
here , you have to hold this .
&quot; brake , left . gas , right &quot; ?
that &apos;s my cheat sheet .

we &apos;re having a party tonight .
okay , tip the man .
if he doesn &apos;t like our cookies , too bad .

so you really did like my cookies ?
yeah , they were so personal . it really showed you cared .

... gel boy .

chestnuts roasting on an open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose
how far did you get ?
mailbox .
all right , we &apos;re getting closer .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s just like a whole mess of stuff .
like yesterday , my dad was this famous burma tree @-@ surgeon guy .
and you know , now he &apos;s a pharmacist guy and ....
well , maybe he &apos;s this really cool pharmacist guy .
yeah , maybe ! and i &apos;ll knock on the door ...
... and he &apos;ll hug me , and i &apos;ll have a dad !
i &apos;ll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me ...
... because , you know , i &apos;m frank &apos;s daughter .
so why not go knock ?
because , i mean , what if he &apos;s not this great @-@ dad guy ?
what if he &apos;s still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us ?
you know what ?
i &apos;ve already lost a fake dad this week .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready to lose a real one .
pheebs , that &apos;s okay . you took a big step today .
someday , when you &apos;re ready , you &apos;ll make it past the hedges .
and when you do , he &apos;ll be lucky to have you .
you guys ....
sorry about your shopping .
oh , that &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll figure something out .
i know you &apos;re not going in there ...
... but you think it &apos;s okay if i go in and use his bathroom ?
that &apos;s fine , never mind .
cool , snow !
kind of like a blank canvas .
ho @-@ ho @-@ ho @-@ holy crap , is it hot in here !
you mind if i turn the heat down ?
we could have used that kind of thinking earlier !
so , pheebs , how did it go ?
oh , i couldn &apos;t go in .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
are you okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s okay , because i know he &apos;s there .
so that &apos;s enough for now .
hey , it &apos;s after midnight ! merry christmas , everyone !
oh , right ! merry christmas !
the knob was broken ...
... so i turned it off from underneath . i hope that &apos;s all right .
thanks .
i guess that just leaves the gifts from joey and chandler .
rach , these are for you .
wiper blades !
i don &apos;t even have a car .
no , but with this new @-@ car smell , you &apos;ll think you do !
okay , pheebs , your turn .
