Gossip girl here,
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
What in the hell were you trying to do?
Get Ben out of prison, mom.
What, by putting me in? The information about Ben
in the affidavit can never get out, ever.
If you ever use that information about Lily,
I'll have you killed.
I figured we could spend the rest of the day
doing... whatever.
Tonight he's thinking about a different girl,
and meanwhile, I lost my job, I failed a test,
and I'm in Brooklyn talking about it to Dan Humphrey.
I overheard this guy talking about you to an employee.
He said that you were responsible for a fire
in one of your own buildings.
I've had that man's death on my conscience for 20 years.
Someone died?
You're just upset because you lost your daddy's company.
Brad, I'm sorry he dragged you into this.
Let me buy you a real dinner.
I think I'll stay and hear young Mr. Bass out.
We'll get through this.
You sound so sure, I almost believe you.
They're ready for us.
I'll be waiting. Hmm?
Lily, this is assistant district attorney Vinson.
He's going to be taking your statement.
Whenever you're ready, Mrs. Humphrey.
They say Rome wasn't built in a day,
and yet what a difference a day makes.
Hey. You coming down?
Mm, hot tea, Dorota,
decaf, and one of my leafy green juices.
Thank you.
B., you okay? You seem different.
Hmm? I'm doing a cleanse.
No, I mean...
Oh. I'm fine.
Being fired/quitting "W" was humiliating,
But it was also a wake-up call.
If Chuck and I are meant to be together,
then I should trust that, and in the meantime,
I want whatever's best for both of us.
Wow, that's very enlightened.
It's the leafy greens.
B vitamins are excellent for cognitive function.
Good, because I need your help.
Ben hasn't been returning any of my texts since we...
spent the night together, and it was amazing,
but it can't be a coincidence that he's suddenly avoiding me.
Well, did you tell him you thought it was amazing?
Well, I think I made it pretty clear.
He is a guy.
You should march over there and make sure he knows.
And take a juice with you for the road.
Thank you. B., you really do seem good.
You're doing it again.
Something is different about you.
I have a sixth sense.
You have no sense.
You don't come to me with any complaints about anything.
You're too happy...
Content. I'm worried you join cult.
I have found my center, that's all.
But... just to reassure you, here's a complaint.
Why haven't you picked up my cocktail dress
for Chuck's party yet?
Charles Bass to see you?
Send him in.
Let me guess.
You were in the neighborhood,
and you thought you'd stop by and gloat.
Oh, no. I came to see Raina. I guess she's not in yet.
I wanted to invite her to a party
I'm having at the empire tonight.
My deal with Kidd closes tomorrow.
You're welcome to attend as well.
Sorry. I didn't come to gloat.
I've just always been a multitasker.
Don't you worry. A victory lap might be premature.
Why would I?
Thanks for my invitation, Chuck.
And as for my daughter's schedule,
You might want to check with your buddy
Nate Archibald.
They've been spending a lot of time together these last few days.
I see that's something else you aren't aware of.
Meaning?
Your deal closes tomorrow,
But you tell Lily I'll see you both tonight.
So I thought maybe we'd catch a matinee at the Ziegfeld
before heading over to blondies to watch Villanova
whup ass on Notre Dame.
Sounds great, but... have you told Chuck about us yet?
We're an "Us"?
I like you.
But I don't wanna come between you and your best friend,
even if that best friend is Chuck Bass.
But...
We haven't done anything yet, so you're free to pull the chute
and walk away if that's what you want.
That's not what I want,
so I'll talk to Chuck today.
In the spirit of full disclosure,
there's something you need to know about me.
My dad and I...
We're Notre Dame fans.
Oh, no.
No, you can't be. What are you talking about?
Uh-huh. Guess... Kids are out of the question.
I can't believe I let you talk me
into the Joseph Beuys exhibit after all.
There was a great article in here on him. You should read it.
We should go over field trip procedures again.
Oh, joy.
Okay, I arrive first, survey the location
in case there's anyone I know and scout out an exit strategy.
You arrive at least 15 minutes later.
Plausible deniability. We just ran into each other.
You're really big on plausible deniability.
Has anybody ever told you that?
Do you wanna explain to someone why we went somewhere together?
Ms. Blair?
Uh... go through my bathroom into Serena's room.
Come on.
Is this really necessary?
Move it!
Dorota.
You scared me. What are you doing back so soon?
Oh, I forgot claim ticket. Who were you talking to?
No one. Maybe your sixth sense is picking up voices
from the other side.
You know what? I could use some fresh air.
I will go with you to get the dress.
Let's go. Now.
"Daniel humphrey."
Daniel humphrey!
Let's go! Chop-chop!
Hey. What are you doing here?
I know I probably should have called first,
but... you haven't returned any of my earlier calls,
so I figured I'd just swallow my pride and stop by.
Now would be a good time to give my pride a boost
and invite me in.
Uh... now actually isn't a good time.
Ben?
What's she doing here?
Uh... Serena, this is my mother, Cynthia.
Mrs. Sharp, I, um,
I'm Serena. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I wish I could say the same.
Ben?
Remember I told you Serena's friends with my roommate Dan.
I'm sorry. He's not here right now,
But I'll--I'll let him know that you stopped by.
So you didn't tell her about us?
No.
Why not?
Sorry, S. Looks like your sweetheart's mom
is still a little sour.
Oh, thank you, Vanya. I just need to make sure
that my Elie Saab dress is in there
for the party tonight.
Here you are, ma'am.
Thank you.
But when it comes to life's bitter pills...
Is everything okay?
Yes, Vanya, thank you.
The hardest to swallow is a taste of your own medicine.
I-I'm sorry.
I-I should've given you a heads up.
She got here a few days ago.
That's why I haven't been able to return your calls.
And here I thought I was being paranoid.
Look, it's hard enough trying to explain to her
Why I haven't tried to clear my name.
If I--if I tell her that we're dating,
she's gonna think I'm doing all this for you.
Her issue is with my mother, not me.
You were able to win over my family and my friends.
I just want the same chance.
Hey, how about we have lunch today,
just the three of us at my place?
I'll talk to her.
Someone who knows about Ben is trying to send a message.
Subtle.
It's Russell, I'm assuming. We spoke this morning.
He told me our victory party was premature.
Well, if he knows, he'll use it to kill the deal,
threaten to go public unless--
He's fishing. If he had proof,
he would've made that play by now.
We need to shut down his lead, whoever it is.
What about Ben?
You don't think Russell could have gotten to him?
Well, I don't think so.
We seem to have resolved our issues, and--
I'd make sure if I were you. In the meantime,
I'll try and find out what Russell's planning.
Charles, I'm so sorry.
Talk to Ben.
So why did you wanna grab coffee with your old man?
Do I need a reason?
No, but you have one.
I, uh, I need your advice,
but I gotta keep the details vague.
Oh, please, the vaguer, the better.
Keeps parenting a challenge.
You ever hung out with someone but not been able
to tell anyone?
You mean, hang out, hang out,
or, you know, hang out, hang out?
Oh, god, this was a bad idea.
What? That was vague. Well, for what it's worth,
when Lily and I started hanging out again,
neither of us wanted anyone else to know.
But friendship can be an excuse,
a cover when there's something more you don't want to admit
or you're too scared to explore.
No, no, no. I mean, there's no way.
That... I mean, even the thought of that is...
Scary.
No, I mean, we're not even friends, I swear.
We're not. Listen, why don't we, uh,
why don't we just turn this coffee into a lunch?
Oh, I thought you said you only had an hour
before you had to be somewhere.
I did, not now I don't.
Would you pick up the pace?
Sorry, I don't want to make you late to...
what exhibit is it again?
Joseph Beuys. Why?
Maybe I could go with you.
You don't even know who he is.
He created term "Social sculpture"
To illustrate idea of art's potential to transform society.
How do you know that?
From Mr. Humphrey's "New york" Magazine
I found in your room.
Just what are you implying?
Your new secrecy, calmness with Mr. Chuck,
supporting Ms. Serena's new boyfriend,
and last week,
I find "Nova" Documentary in your netflix queue!
What are you doing in my queue?
You and lonely boy are having affair!
We are not!
We have gone to a few things together.
It started over the holidays. It's no big deal.
No big deal? We have to tell ms. Serena.
We will do no such thing.
I am not friends with Dan Humphrey.
And to prove it, I will happily skip the beuys exhibit
and leave him hanging. I would rather shop anyhow.
So come on. Let's go. First stop, Chlo?
Well, thank you for the tour, Serena.
Good thing you're serving lunch.
I'm hungry after all that walking.
Mom.
I'm just trying to joke. I'm nervous.
I'm not used to being in a place like this.
So I thought I would keep things simple for lunch.
Most people's favorite pizza in Manhattan is John's,
but I've always been partial to Joe's.
I'm, uh, lactose-intolerant.
Oh, my gosh. I'm... i'm so sorry.
Salad it is, then?
Here you go.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. This is, um...
About school, and I forgot the iced tea,
so I'll be right back.
Hey, mom, can we talk later?
This will only take a minute.
Why are you whispering?
Ben and I are having lunch with his mother.
His mother? Serena, Charles and I think
that Russell Thorpe knows about Ben and is gonna use it
to sabotage Charles' deal.
I hate to ask this, but I need to make sure
that Ben hasn't told anyone about the affidavit,
that he hasn't had a change of heart.
No, no, no, of course he hasn't.
But I'll talk to him. I'm sure everything's fine.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, someone's here. Um, will you call me
after you speak to him?
Yeah, of course.
I know you don't wanna speak to me,
but Serena won't return my calls,
and she told her doorman to tell me she wasn't home
even though I saw that she was on "Gossip girl."
Can you blame her?
It's about ben.
So... if you haven't already guessed,
Serena and I are more than just friends.
You think I don't know?
Why do you think I came to New York?
How'd you figure it out?
It doesn't matter. What matters is that you're giving up
any chance of getting your life back for her.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Because it's the truth.
And you don't see it, but you're caught in a trap.
You wanna be the kind of man that Serena Van der Woodsen
could be with. You could do that.
But not without clearing my name and getting my record expunged,
which I can't do without destroying Serena's family.
You can only lose here, Ben.
Mom...
I think I left my purse upstairs.
Please, uh, tell Serena that I said good-bye.
You were right.
This is a much better idea than spending the day
pretending to like some German pedagogue of art.
I'm gonna shop until you drop.
That could happen at any time.
Go to Ralph Lauren. Have them pull everything in my size.
I'll meet you there.
But, please, my--I'm beginning to lose feeling in my fingers.
Well, then go to Cafe Boulud
and get us a table. We'll have lunch.
I thought you were on cleanse.
Excuse me?
Why aren't you at Mona meeting me?
I decided to grab lunch with my dad instead.
Why aren't you at Mona meeting me?
I'm standing you up.
Ah, well, apparently, great minds think alike.
But I had good reason.
And I would love to hear that reason,
but my dad is gonna be out any second,
and I haven't scouted an exit strategy for you, so...
We are not done here.
Yeah, we are.
Why would a friendship based on fight
suddenly end in flight?
They say we only run from the things that truly scare us.
Hey, I was watching you this morning, man.
You looked good.
Thanks.
I was, uh, just leaving. What's up?
I'm looking for Raina.
I thought you might know her schedule.
Or are you going to stand there and lie to my face?
Look, we're just hanging out. Okay? That's it.
I guess the Archibald charm wasn't as rusty as you thought,
unlike the knife in my back.
I talked you up to her like you asked me to.
She wanted nothing to do with you.
Don't sugarcoat it.
I like Raina, all right? And she likes me.
I didn't mean for it to happen this way, but it did.
I'm sorry. What else can I do?
There is one thing.
Did you come all the way to Brooklyn
just to yell at me? 'cause that's really not necessary.
Yes, it is. Dorota saw your "New York" Magazine
and accused us of having an affair.
That's why I stood you up.
So you mean because we were sneaking around,
She assumed we were covering something up?
Can you believe it?
Well, only because my dad basically told me
the same thing. Look, if anyone else finds out about this--
They'll jump to the same conclusion.
God. I knew you'd be my social death, Humphrey.
I just knew it!
No, you know what? It's gonna be fine.
We can make it fine. All we have to do is tell everyone
that we've been hanging out. It's not gonna be a big deal
unless we keep making it a big deal.
Right, which it totally isn't. You know, we should soften
the ground, put out an anonymous post on "Gossip girl"
that some big secret is going to come out at Chuck's party.
That way, everyone will assume that some earth-shattering,
huge scandal is eminent, like--
You getting traded for a hotel?
Or you raising Georgina's baby by a Russian mobster.
We'll have successfully managed expectations,
and by the time our friendship is announced,
it'll seem like nothing at all.
So we tell everyone tonight. Agreed?
Agreed. Oh, and... only I get to joke about the hotel.
Still too soon.
A few years ago, my stepmother perjured herself,
and an innocent man went to prison.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I believe your father already knows.
And I think he's planning
to use this information as leverage to blow my deal.
How many times do I have to tell you?
He isn't like you.
Maybe not yet, but if I'm right,
he's about to cross the line.
You can stop him, raina.
But if you care about him, you'll do this.
I would never confront him based on your word alone.
I'm not asking you to.
Hey, mom, thanks for coming. Lunch did not end well.
Serena, we need to talk.
What's she doing here?
You need to listen to her.
No, I don't, and neither should you.
Vanessa, tell her.
When Nate's dad was in prison, was he attacked?
Yeah, and Nate was pretty upset about it.
Why? What does this have to do with me?
Because the person who had him attacked was Ben.
You're lying.
I heard it from Ben himself.
I overheard him telling Damien after Eric's party.
Just... get out, please.
Serena, you should be careful.
His sister made me think she was someone else, too.
Darling, I think Vanessa's telling the truth.
Is it possible that you don't know Ben
as well as you think you do?
Is it possible that he's talked to Russell?
Why would Ben care about Russell Thorpe?
And if he wanted revenge,
he would have gone to the police himself weeks ago.
Besides, the affidavit proves what you did.
Wait a minute. You didn't destroy it?
No. I-I thought I should hold on to it for safekeeping.
I mean, isn't that why you had it in the safety deposit box
in the first place?
Did Ben know where you kept it?
Yeah, but you don't think...
Where is it now?
Oh, my god.
It's gone. He took it.
Looks like the jury on Ben might be out after all.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Photo, Chuck?
Champagne, sir?
Thank you. Thank you all for coming.
As you know, my deal with Bradley Kidd
officially closes tomorrow.
As they always say, why put off till tomorrow
a party you could throw today? Cheers.
We're all set.
When I meet Russell in my suite, Raina will be in the kitchen.
As soon as she hears him blackmail me,
she'll confront him.
Do you think that'll be enough?
The only thing that's more important to him than
ruining us is maintaining his relationship with his daughter.
Have you spoken to Ben?
He hasn't returned any of my calls.
Hopefully, he didn't hear the panic in my voice
and is still coming here.
I know I can talk him out of it.
He just got turned around by his mother.
Well, I'm sure that's so, but if he's already
given it to Russell, then it's over.
I'm so sorry, mom.
Ohh. Don't be. It's not your mistake.
It never was.
He's here.
Hey. So... did you see the post on "Gossip girl"
about some huge secret coming out tonight?
Yeah, and I think I know what it's about.
You do?
Ben has the forged affidavit
that could put my mother in jail.
We think that he gave it to Russell Thorpe,
who's gonna try to blackmail her and Chuck with it.
Oh, my gosh. S., I'm so sorry.
Serena, hey.
Wow. Listen, I mean, it's really not that big of a deal--
Impolite to interrupt, Humphrey.
Look, you go talk to Ben, and I'll be here
whenever you need me.
Thank you.
What's going on? Did you tell her?
Now's not a good time.
Hey. Are you okay?
I know you took it.
What?
Don't. You knew where the affidavit was.
Just please tell me you haven't given it to Russell yet.
Why would I do that?
I heard your mother's speech today about how you couldn't
have a life until you turned my mother in
and turned your back on me.
I guess she convinced you.
After all this time, you still don't trust me?
What do I need to do that I haven't done already?
Be honest with me.
I have.
Okay. Well, what about Nate's dad?
I had that done, yeah.
But do you know how many things
I haven't told you about my time in prison--
Things that I-I just wanna forget?
Look, I know what you were going through,
but to have someone attacked--
Do not tell me that you understand what I went through.
Hi. Lily? We haven't officially met,
but do you know who I am?
Let me hazard a guess and say that
I'm surprised to see you here, Mrs. Sharp.
Hey, Russell, good to see you.
Oh. My friend has arrived. Good.
Hello, Russell.
How are you?
Good to see you. Are you enjoying yourself?
Russell Thorpe. How do you, uh...
Ben didn't steal the affidavit.
You did.
Mr. Thorpe contacted me and said that
if I could get Ben to turn on you,
then he could get Ben his life back.
Of course, he wouldn't listen, but it didn't matter,
because he'd already let it slip about the affidavit.
Ben will never forgive you for what you've done.
Well, as parents,
sometimes we have to make those tough choices.
After all, isn't that what you told yourself?
Hey, dad, I'm glad you're here. There's actually something
I need to... talk to you or tell you about.
Well, am I getting some details this time?
On a need-to-know basis, but yes.
Good, because I saw you talking to Blair earlier,
and I just about had a heart attack.
What do you mean?
Well, just how crazy it would be if your secret relationship
was with someone like Blair Waldorf.
No, I know. I know. That would-- that would be crazy.
Um, Rufus, can I talk to you alone?
Daniel, would you mind?
It's fine. It's, uh, it's nothing that can't wait.
Lily? What is it?
Nate. Hey.
What are you doing here?
I was heading to the bar to meet you.
What are you doing here? You're looking for Chuck.
I am, actually, but...
You don't understand, and you can't be here.
Chuck is on his way up with my father.
Come on.
Is this quiet enough for you?
I should talk to him alone.
No, this is my mess. Trust me, you're going to need me.
Well, you called this meeting.
You didn't wanna wear that gift I sent you this morning?
Orange is so your color.
I have guests downstairs.
And I have the nail for your coffin.
It's just a copy, of course.
Perjury, obstruction of justice,
Bribery of public officials.
Why don't we cut right to it?
That I can do.
You sign over bass industries once and for all,
or I'll destroy you and your entire family.
I'm surprised you even have to think it over.
I wasn't thinking. I was waiting.
For what?
For me.
He was right about you,
this whole time.
He was right.
I'd follow her if I were you.
No. He signs over the company right now,
or you're going to jail.
Maybe, but not because of you or anyone else.
I called the D.A. ten minutes ago.
Rufus is waiting in the car to take me downtown.
Lily, you can't.
Once I go onord with the truth
no one can hold this against us anymore.
Just promise me one thing.
Before Thorpe leaves here tonight,
tell that son of a bitch where he can stick it.
Thank you for saving his legacy.
Bass industries isn't his legacy, Charles.
You are.
Oh. You heard the lady.
If that's all, I have guests downstairs.
They can wait. Don't you even wanna know why--
why I was willing to sacrifice my own daughter
just to destroy your precious little legacy?
Because Lily left you for my father.
I think you know me better than that by now.
Did Raina ever talk about her mother?
Careful, Chuck. When it comes to Bart Bass,
seek, and who knows what you may find?
Raina, wait up. Hey, wait. Talk to me.
I can't. You don't understand.
Trust me. I do. And finding out your father isn't the person
you grew up idolizing sucks,
but it doesn't mean he loves you any less.
Then what does it mean?
It means that he's human.
Okay, and you have a chance, if you want,
to get to know the real him-- the good and the bad.
What if I don't want to?
You do.
When I was a little girl, he was larger than life...
Like superman.
Yeah, but doesn't it make you feel a little better
to know that he wasn't?
You're smarter than you look, Archibald.
I get that a lot.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You wanna go catch the game highlights somewhere?
I just need to not talk about this for a while.
Yeah. That'd be great.
My mom just left. She's turning herself in.
D.A. Already called me to come down.
She told me it was your mother that took the affidavit.
Never should've mentioned it.
I just... didn't think she would do something like that.
But... I'm to blame for what happened either way.
Pretty sure Damien's the one that went to Thorpe.
Why would he do that?
I thought you told him last week you wouldn't cooperate.
That's not exactly what I told him.
I got pretty physical with him a while back,
and... I told him what I had done to the captain.
You ever have a dream that... feels so real,
when you wake up,
You just wanna lie there with your eyes closed
to hold on to it?
I barely remember being a teacher at Knightley.
Being with you makes it feel real
because you remember.
I do.
But maybe it's time for me to open my eyes
and let it go.
You mean let me go.
I obviously have a lot to figure out.
Well, that guy that I fell for at Knightley--
You're still him.
And I can see that even if you can't.
I don't know. Maybe one day, when you do...
You're lying.
Believe me, I wish I were.
Because of your father, my wife is dead.
No. I confronted my father about the fire
when he was alive.
It was an accident.
He owned up to the death of the security guard.
He never mentioned a woman.
Why do you think the security guard
was in the building?
He was trying to save my wife.
No one knows the truth, not even Raina.
She thinks her mother left me for another man.
When my father died, we were in a good place.
You're trying to rob me of that.
You'd say anything to hurt me.
Perhaps. But I think you know your father well enough
to believe that he was capable of deliberately taking a life.
I hope your stepmother enjoys rotting in jail,
protecting the legacy of the great Bart Bass.
Yeah, I'll have the same.
Lily turning herself in is already on "Gossip girl."
Looks like my fake post of big news turned out to be prophetic.
This is gonna hit the upper east side
like a hurricane.
Serena, Eric, Lily--
They're gonna need us now more than ever.
And not us. Dan and Blair-- individual entities,
Two proper nouns separated by a conjunction.
Or a comma, if--if mentioned in a list.
Which is rare, since we have nothing in common,
and are, in fact, opposites.
The kind of opposites who do not attract.
Most definitely not.
No.
The world just wasn't ready for a Humphrey-Waldorf friendship.
It's been nice not being friends with you.
Let's--let's not do it again sometime.
Hey, everything okay?
Shut it down.
What?
This.
All of this--shut it down.
Thank you for coming down, Mr.Donovan.
Mrs. Humphrey has signed a full confession
but has one demand she says is non-negotiable--
that your record be expunged immediately.
I'll be seeing to it personally.
I know it doesn't make up for anything--far from it.
But it's a start--
a fresh start for you.
Thank you.
Ben...
My daughter has a good heart--
much bigger than mine.
And she cares for you.
I care for her, too.
I always will.
If you don't mind my asking,
you seem in pretty good spirits
for someone facing possible jail time.
Do you have kids?
A boy--Max. He's almost 8 months.
Yeah, he does.
Well, my kids haven't smiled at me for a long time,
and tonight when I told my daughter
I was coming down here,
she said she was proud of me.
And she smiled.
When we finish up , I'll wake a judge.
I know our ties to the community.
We won't object to bail. It's a good thing
you've got an excellent lawyer. You're gonna need him.
Rufus.
Hello.
Will, what the hell are you doing here?
Cece called me,
told me about, uh, Lily's situation.
Cece called you?
That's right. Jumped in a helicopter as soon as I heard.
Are Serena and Eric here as well?
No, they're not, and I suggest you leave.
I'm not the only one that remembers why you were run
out of town after your last visit.
I appreciate your concern, Rufus.
Uh, I'll tell you what. I'll let Cece explain everything.
She's flying in as soon as she can.
What?
I don't think Lily quite realizes what she's in for.
It's, uh, time to circle the wagons, Rufus.
That's what we do best.
What are you talking about? It was fouled.
You call that a foul?
Maybe you're not as smart as you look.
See you upstairs?
What are you doing here?
You weren't returning my calls.
I was hoping you'd come back here.
I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.
I'm heading back to Chicago...
tonight.
I'm not coming with you.
I know Lily turned herself in,
but that doesn't change anything between us.
I wasn't expecting it to.
I just hope one day...
you can forgive me.
You've grown into an amazing woman, Raina.
You're strong, tough,
and decent.
And even if you don't feel proud
to be my daughter right now...
I've never been prouder to be your father.
You look more like your mother every day.
Have you seen Blair?
No. She left a while ago. I'm assuming she went home.
Chuck, talk to me.
My mom just turned herself in to protect you.
Why'd you shut down the party?
Nothing to celebrate.
What are you talking about? The company is safe.
You're about to be the head of your father's empire.
It's what you've always wanted.
What I wanted-- all I ever wanted--
was to know him, for him to let me in.
He lied to me until the day he died.
I need to talk to Blair.
She's the only one who will understand.
Understand what? You're not making any sense.
Chuck, maybe you should go upstairs and get some sleep.
I have to find her.
Well, I'll come with you.
The question of whether we can fight fate
will always remain a mystery.
What are you doing here?
But the bigger question
is what happens when we stop fighting it?
I don't know. Is Serena here?
No. What's going on? Is everything okay?
I've been walking around the city all night
with one all-consuming, paralyzing thought.
"Why am I walking around the city
when I live in Brooklyn?"
What if my dad and Dorota were right?
What if there's another reason
we're keeping us a secret?
Another reason like what?
Plausible deniability?
Blair, we kept us a secret 'cause we were afraid
there was something more.
You need to go back to Brooklyn.
Not until I know for sure they were wrong,
that there is nothing between us.
I can guarantee it.
But just so you're secure in that knowledge,
what did you have in mind?
Just one kiss, then we can know without a doubt.
I suppose that would work.
One kiss. That's that.
One kiss, and that's that.
So?
So?
Oh, for crying out loud, Humphrey.
