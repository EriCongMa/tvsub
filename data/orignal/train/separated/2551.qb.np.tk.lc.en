happy valentine &apos;s day , everybody .
i don &apos;t see why , unless you found that missing puzzle piece .
how &apos; bout i put on some music ?
* i ... never ... *
* smiled again ... *
oh , i used to dance with my auggie to that tune .
yeah , me and my bubbeleh made love to that song .
creating a kid who never visits .
and now back to prairie home companion .
pull the plug !
no , on me .
okay , time for some valentine &apos;s candy for our swinging seniors .
don &apos;t patronize us , we know it &apos;s pills .
but it &apos;s a new brand and they &apos;re so pretty-- look , green .
like m &amp; m &apos;s with hope .
oh , it &apos;s starting to kick in .
much ... better .
suddenly , i don &apos;t want to kvetch .
i want to kvell !
i can feel all the tension going out of my beard .
mona ? i thought you were gone .
nonsense , abe .
i didn &apos;t leave you and i am never going to leave you .
that doesn &apos;t sound like the mona i knew .
i &apos;m the mona that lives in your memory ,
with all the anger turned to honey by nostalgia .
so what you &apos;re saying is ,
this is really happening .
do you think it &apos;s okay to leave them here ?
marge , all we ever do is leave them here .
i just think there &apos;s more we should do .
we could visit your mother .
no . no , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s go home .
check it out , guys .
cvs stands for cheap valentines &apos; surplus .

professor ?
professor , come on , this is a workplace .
ooh , dregs !
oh , my egg head is pickled , muh @-@ oyvic .
did you sleep here all night ?
yes , you are right , i did .
valentine &apos;s day , you see , is quite difficult for me .
i saw that stephen hawking movie and all i could think is ,
&quot; he &apos;s got a girl ? &quot; give me a frickin &apos; break .
two girls .
oh , i &apos;ll never win ,
and i &apos;ll always have to only be looking .
listen , pal , i &apos;ve had plenty of experience with one woman .
and i can tell you ,
relationships are just trial and error .
like anniversaries .
first i tried &quot; don &apos;t remember , &quot;
then &quot; remember too late , &quot;
then i happily settled on &quot; make lisa remember . &quot;
and my relationship with lisa has never been better .
yes , you say trial and error , eh ?
my good man , that is nothing more than the scientific method .
well , now , that &apos;s a little wasteful .
ah , much better .
i shall use science to uncover the secret to women .
homer , scientific research
can solve anything except for cold fusion , quasars ,
the interior of black holes and what preceded the big bang .
but everything else can be solved , including love .
pish @-@ posh , professor .
what makes a guy and a girl click isn &apos;t science .
it &apos;s chemistry !
which is science .
what ? !
see , i have asked an enormous cross @-@ section of women
one single question--
what attracts you to a man ?
let us listen and learn and have some lemonade ,
which i just squeezed nicely .
the most important thing that i look for ...
i like it when they &apos;re tall .
blue eyes !
definitely wants kids .
hmm , i didn &apos;t hear the last one .
first i &apos;ll replace these coke bottle glasses
with invisible blue contacts .
next , of course , is shoe lifts for height .
make you much taller , look down upon people .
it &apos;s wonderful . whoa , whoa ...
hey , look at me . i &apos;m herman munster !
actually , he had lily , who was quite a dish .
so , do you , uh , find me attractive ?
sorry , but no .
oh , curse the luck !
and this is an android
that i programmed to say nothing but &quot; yes . &quot;
why ? why ? why ?
what am i over @-@ look @-@ ing ?
uh , professor ... don &apos;t be offended .
do you think it might be your voice ?
why , what &apos;s wrong with my voice ,
with the up and down and the extra words
and the terminal nonsense in the hoyven clyven wayen .
oh , my god , it &apos;s the voice .
hello .
we &apos;re here to see abe simpson .
i brought him a homemade card !
i brought me . that &apos;s enough .
oh ... what the ... ?
gee , i thought they &apos;d be over this by now .
wow , they are really out of it .
there must be some way to take advantage of them .
you &apos;re telling me !
this little device , which fits under the tongue ,
will change everything .
this voice is an amalgam of great voices
from clark gable ...
to walter cronkite ...
to rush limbaugh !
i don &apos;t agree with his politics ,
but his body is a natural echo chamber .
wow . that does change everything .
you turned me on .
oh , it &apos;s time for a little field test , i see .
any other advice , homer ?
yep-- hang out at yoga classes .
that &apos;s where the ladies are .
how would you know about yoga class ?
uh , i thought it was yogurt class .
twenty @-@ one ! dealer wins again .
now , here &apos;s our headliner , dolly parton .
oh , she &apos;s good .
bart !
ay , caramba !
you &apos;re taking advantage of these people
who don &apos;t know where they are .
i &apos;m taking them back where they belong .
oh , no , you don &apos;t .
he just comped me a suite !
fantastic !
you can &apos;t keep pumping powerful drugs
into people who can &apos;t even bite into a peach .
mrs. simpson , it &apos;s a fact .
if these seniors aren &apos;t medicated ,
i can &apos;t binge @-@ watch boardwalk empire .
nucky dies at the end !
yeah , well , screw you .
i &apos;m going to report you to the state .
i really don &apos;t care .
wha ... ?
you broke me .
i &apos;m going to say something i &apos;ve never said .
how can i help you ?
um , i &apos;ll wait outside
&apos;cause they might make me do something .
i &apos;ve changed my height , i &apos;ve changed my eyes ,
my relationship status--
i @-@ i don &apos;t know why i put &quot; unavailable &quot; there .
that certainly did not help matters .
but now it is time to change my voice ...
oyce ... voy ...
and the hoyvin and the flayvin
are now &quot; hasta la vista , frinky . &quot;
i &apos;m always next to the jerk
who comes here to meet women .
hey , look , i get you .
you broke up with a long- time high school boyfriend
&apos;cause he just wasn &apos;t going anywhere .
then you play the field , but it &apos;s all losers
who just want to take from you .
now you &apos;re just hoping beyond hope
for a man you can hug
who &apos;ll organize the wires behind your tv .
and believe you me , sweetheart ,
i can organize every wire you have .
now i &apos;d like to show you a picture of my new puppy .
yeah , his name &apos;s ...
logarithm .
i mean larry .
aw ... here &apos;s my number .
and to prove it &apos;s not a lie ...
yeah , baby .
call me !
man , you &apos;re reading page three
and the next thing you know ,
you &apos;re finishing the last article , hmm .
i got all their numbers !
boy , you are smooth .
carl smooth .
now i &apos;d better get home .
and in case marge is mad , can i borrow that chip ?
oh , sure thing , pal . i have extras .
chitter , chitter , baby .
i was so worried .
where have you been ?
no , don &apos;t tell me .
i don &apos;t want to hear one of your stupid lies .
marge , my dear ,
you are the pork chop with gravy on top .
and i &apos;m the applesauce that brings out your flavor .
oh , homie .
what the hell was that ?
what the ... ?
you &apos;re not my wife .
which i find intriguing .
suit yourself .
so , professor , tell me all about last night .
dish @-@ dish @-@ dish !
uh , yes , well , i can &apos;t talk now . i &apos;m on a date .
and then i have a date .
and then another date .

this is my cousin , nookie kwan .
i &apos;m number one on the east side .
oh , gah @-@ layvin .

he ain &apos;t here .
but his hover @-@ tronic

hey , moe , there &apos;s a rat floating in my beer .
it ain &apos;t there .

but , uh , i saw some terrible things down there .
like for one , moe is pantsless .
hey , it &apos;s apron @-@ only tuesday .
you &apos;re a lucky guy , frinky .

while i can &apos;t find a single woman
to put up with me and my domesticated wolverine .
lucky frink . i got nothin &apos; .
some guys get all the breaks .
let me see here .
uh , needy men ...
plus lonely women ...
i @-@ i just bring them together !
hey , that &apos;s some nice thinkin &apos; there .
now , how &apos; bout a beer and a baked potato .
ah , that sounds nice .
we don &apos;t serve baked potatoes .
what happened ?
everyone is incredibly depressed .
i admit the hallucinations were getting out of hand ,
so i stopped the meds .
and hid them in the one place they &apos;ll never look : the library .
well , there &apos;s one thing you didn &apos;t count on--
i go there because it &apos;s the only room in this building with heat .
grampa , you &apos;re not allowed to take dangerous drugs
unless they &apos;re in a little paper cup .
listen here .
every night i watch my roommate cry himself to sleep .
yesterday i found out it was a mirror !
i &apos;m gonna find my mona !
there &apos;s a lesson here-- never visit grampa .
my old car .
oh , that &apos;s some fine hallucinatin &apos; .
to the good ol &apos; days before polio was cured !
不许不抽烟
hot diggity !
it &apos;s america the way i liked it ,
before we went to the moon and discovered how boring it was .
i found the one happy moment in 80 years of life
and i ain &apos;t leavin &apos; it .
oh , this ain &apos;t right .
that &apos;s better !
this ends right now !
she &apos;s not real . none of this is real .
imaginary cigarettes ? nonexistent candy ?
get outta here , marge !
unescorted women like you aren &apos;t allowed in this era !
i &apos;m not getting out , i &apos;m cutting in .
you can &apos;t live here .
you have people in the real world who love you .
two are standing right over here .
if you live in the past , you &apos;ll never have us .
and what &apos;s more precious to a grampa than his grandchildren ?
particularly his grandson .
aw , your sexist argument has won me over .
we women will have our day .
attaboy .
good @-@ bye , mona .
and good @-@ bye , pack of cigarettes for a quarter .
i think i &apos;ll miss you the most .
so what , uh ...
all that dancin &apos; around with me meant nothin &apos; ?
oh , i &apos;ll be back to steal a kiss later .
and as for you ...
i &apos;ve got more involved plans .
so , frink is finally going to announce which woman
he &apos;s chosen to be with at the springfield planetarium .
it &apos;s like an episode of the bachelor ,
but you drive there and pay six dollars for parking .
why are we both explaining it if we all know what &apos;s happening ?
i like talking to you .
ladies , please pay attention here .
you see , i , uh ... i thought i was the only one who was lonely .
but i have learned that loneliness is everywhere ,
like superhero movies .
how many times can batman begin ?
i have reworked my algorithms
to make you not like me ,
but to find the man that will make each of you happiest , yes .
uh , release the bachelors !
i hope they enjoy it .
duffman would love to be taught
how to speak in the first @-@ person .
everyone &apos;s paired up .
almost everyone &apos;s paired up .
professor , what about you ?
where &apos;s your match ?
for me , my true love is intellectual conquest ,
the @-@ the music of the spheres .
well , sometimes it &apos;s good just to be alone .
* and now the purple dusk of twilight time *
* steals across the meadows of my heart *
* high up in the sky *
* the little stars climb *
what are you doing with my daughter ? !
why did i build a mother ? oi , goy @-@ vick .
wait a minute , how come we &apos;re all back here ?
i flushed the rest of the pills down the toilet .
looks like they made their way to the reservoir .
we should really try to wake up .
are you kidding ? there &apos;s a full buffet
and dean martin &apos;s here .
eh , that &apos;s right , pally .
here , try the shrimp .
some have gone bad , but , uh , most are fine .
