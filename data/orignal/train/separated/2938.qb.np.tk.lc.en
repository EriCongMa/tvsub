hey , ross .
i &apos;m so glad someone &apos;s here . could you zip me up ?
sure .
thank you .
can you believe no one between my apartment and here ..
offered to do that for me ?
people .
so why are you so dressed up ?
mike &apos;s picking me up for a date .
how &apos;s that going ? is it getting serious ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know . i mean , i like him .
but am i ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market ?
i &apos;m not quite sure .
you know , i really admire your whole dating attitude .
it &apos;s so healthy . i &apos;m always like , &quot; is this moving too fast ?
is this moving too slow ? where &apos;s this going ? &quot;
i know . you are a bit of a drama queen .
you &apos;re so much better off . you just go from guy to guy having fun ..
and not worrying that it never turns into anything serious .
i wouldn &apos;t say &quot; never . &quot;
you know , there is that guy .
okay , well , what about .. ?
okay , there &apos;s gotta be someone .
there isn &apos;t ! that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
oh , my god , you &apos;re right !
i know . and yet , here you are , all ready for the next date .
i can &apos;t believe i never realized this before .
i &apos;m in my 30s , and i &apos;ve never been in a long @-@ term relationship .
oh , my god , what &apos;s wrong with me ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
i mean , you don &apos;t strike me as the type of person that wants to get married .
i want to get married !
no , please .. please don &apos;t cry because of me .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about , okay ? i &apos;ve been divorced three times .
at least you &apos;ve been married .
oh , my god ! i want to trade lives with ross ? !
phoebe .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i &apos;m excited about our date .
mike , this is ross geller . ross , this is mike ..
sorry , i didn &apos;t catch that .
mike hanigan .
ross geller .
hey .
so are you sure you &apos;re ready to go ?
how do i look ?
do you have a compact in your purse ?
no .
you look great .
the.one.with.the.sharks
hey , joey .
this girl won &apos;t turn around .
i can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s hot or not . what do you think ?
joey , i am not going to objectify women with you .
but if her face is as nice as her ass ..
mama !
all right . thanks .
have you talked to chandler ?
he has to stay in tulsa this weekend .
how come ?
i don &apos;t know . he has to work .
there &apos;s some big rush on the ..
damn it . i &apos;m gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job .
why don &apos;t you fly out there and surprise him ?
i &apos;d love to . i really miss him .
but i can &apos;t . i have one day off and it &apos;s just too expensive .
interesting . so chandler &apos;s not worth the price of a plane ticket to you .
of course he is .
maybe i will go .
we &apos;ll have a little second honeymoon at the tulsa ramada .
you should bring your black see @-@ through teddy with the attached garters .
how do you know i have one of those ?
didn &apos;t until just now .
hot . not hot .
hot !
excuse me ?
i said that i think you &apos;re hot .
and .. now i &apos;m embarrassed .
i thought you said &quot; hi . &quot;
that would &apos;ve been better .
i &apos;ll try that . hi , i &apos;m joey .
i &apos;m hayley .
look , i don &apos;t normally ask out women that i meet in coffeehouses .
gesundheit .
but ..
this is hard . i &apos;m kind of shy .
seriously , you should see someone about that cold .
if it gets much worse , you could die .
anyway ..
i would love to go out with you .
really ? great .
did i .. ? did i actually ask you ?
that &apos;s just where you were going . i figured i &apos;d help you out .
you don &apos;t seem like the kind of guy who does this a lot ?
damn it , gunther , you gave it to me .
oh , it &apos;s you .
with vegetarian corndogs .
come on , i just want to talk to you .
about what ? how few ova i have left ?
come on , i just wanna apologize for what happened yesterday .
i &apos;m sorry , phoebe .
that &apos;s okay , ross .
so how &apos;d the date go ?
well , it was awful .
i barely got through dinner .
every time i thought about what you said , i cried .
i &apos;m pretty sure he spent most of the night just staring at me in horror .
but i couldn &apos;t know for sure because my eyes were swollen shut .
you know i wasn &apos;t trying to make you cry .
i was really trying to say something nice .
i was basically saying even though you &apos;ve never been in a serious relationship ..
are we gonna do this again ?
sorry .
so he hasn &apos;t called ?
would you call this girl :
&quot; thanks for .. a lovely .. evening &quot; ?
now i feel terrible . this is all my fault .
you know what you should feel terrible about ?
this could have been my serious guy .
he was sweet and smart and funny .
you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that ?
we are a rare breed .
hey , maybe that &apos;s him .
hello ?
could you hold on one sec ?
i need some privacy .
is it mike ?
no , it &apos;s a heavy breather . i &apos;ll take what i can get .
i &apos;m listening .
what a great dinner .
thanks again for letting me have that last piece of cake at the restaurant .
you &apos;re welcome again . i &apos;m gonna go make some coffee .
can i get you anything ?
do you have any cake ?
so this is going pretty good .
dinner was nice . we &apos;ve got a lot in common .
victoria &apos; s secret .
we even like the same books .
there &apos;s a scary painting .
wait a minute .
i think i &apos;ve been scared by that painting before .
you know what ? this whole place looks familiar .
i have definitely been in this apartment .
i know i &apos;ve seen this weird plant before .
it did that the last time !
oh , my god . i &apos;ve gone out with this girl before .
yeah ! we had sex on this couch !
and then on that chair , and .. no .
no , we didn &apos;t do it here ..
which is weird , because it seems like a perfectly good place .
that &apos;s why .
hey , mike . sorry to just drop by like this . can i come in ?
sure .
who are you ?
i &apos;m ross . phoebe &apos;s friend from the coffeehouse ?
i really , really need to talk to you about something .
unless ..
you &apos;re not gonna try and get me to join a cult , are you ?
no , it &apos;s just , you know , you have that look .
damn supercuts !
well , what &apos;s up ? is phoebe okay ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
phoebe is great . but ..
i &apos;m an idiot , okay ?
right before you guys went out ..
i accidentally got her all upset .
that &apos;s why she was weird .
yes . yeah , i ..
yeah , i said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship .
but you should know , she is so much fun . a wonderful person .
please , don &apos;t blow her off .
i &apos;m not gonna blow her off .
i just spoke to her . we &apos;re going out tomorrow night .
i mean , i hope that &apos;s okay with you , stranger from the coffeehouse .
that &apos;s great . so the crying didn &apos;t turn you off ?
i just got out of a nine @-@ year relationship with a manic @-@ depressive .
compared to that , phoebe &apos;s a mousketeer .
well , then , i didn &apos;t need to bother you .
you or the four other mike hanigans i bothered .
one of whom was quite large and a little flirty .
wait . wait . wait . wait . is that true what you said ?
phoebe &apos;s never had a serious relationship ?
of course she has .
if she &apos;s never had a serious relationship ..
do you think i &apos;d go around broadcasting it ..
like some kind of unstoppable moron ?
but you did say it .
yes . yes , i did .
and i will also say ..
what i &apos;m about to say ..
vis @-@ a @-@ vis ..
the following .
phoebe has never had a serious relationship ..
since ..
her super @-@ serious relationship ..
with ..
vikram .
vikram ?
what ? that &apos;s a real name .
stop it !
why couldn &apos;t they have sent me to texas ?
seven o &apos;clock .
maybe i &apos;ll hit the gym .
who am i kidding ? pay @-@ per @-@ view porn .
do not disturb ! do not disturb !
surprise !
monica ?
is everything all right ?
yeah , everything &apos;s great . i was just ..
watching some regular television there .
what a pleasant surprise .
i &apos;m gonna go freshen up , okay ?
okay , honey .
that was close .
you &apos;re not even there
hello .
hey , rach , it &apos;s me .
okay , i just got to chandler &apos;s room , and i caught him ..
molesting himself .
that couldn &apos;t have been pretty .
but you know , guys do that .
well , the weird part is ..
he was getting off .. to a shark @-@ attack show !
no !
yes ! chandler watches shark porn !
while watching sharks ?
yeah .
are you sure that &apos;s what he was doing ?
you know how many times i &apos;ve seen him jump up like that ?
believe me , i know what he was doing .
man ! sharks !
i always knew there was something weird about that dude .
you promised to love him no matter what .
&quot; what &quot; means , like , if he gets a disease or kills someone .
not if he gets his jollies to jaws .
you know what , honey ? guys are just different .
they like things that we can &apos;t understand .
i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend ..
that he was an archeologist , and i was this ..
naughty cavewoman who he unfroze from a block of ice .
are you talking about my brother ?
i didn &apos;t disguise that very well , did i ?
hey .
hi .
i went out with this girl last night . halfway through our date i realized ..
i already slept with her .
you &apos;ve slept with all the women in n.y. , and now you &apos;re going around again ?
that &apos;s not even the weird part .
she didn &apos;t remember sleeping with me !
you don &apos;t remember sleeping with her .
but she should remember sleeping with me . i am very memorable !
you guys know .
how do we know ?
we &apos;ve never slept with you .
and whose fault is that ?
what &apos;s the big deal ? you forgot , she forgot .
maybe you were having an off night .
hey !
i never have an off night . okay ?
although , sometimes if i &apos;m a little bloated , i don &apos;t feel that sexy .
but even then , i &apos;m better than most !
honey , why don &apos;t you just let it go and ask her out again ?
you &apos;re both so slutty , you don &apos;t remember who you slept with .
you &apos;re made for each other .
interesting .
well , i &apos;ll go out with her again and i &apos;ll try to get past it .
no salt ! bloaty !
joey ?
what ?
you don &apos;t think sharks are sexy , do you ?
no .
wait a minute . wait , what was the little mermaid ?
it &apos;s open !
hey .
mike called ! we &apos;re going out again !
quick thing . i went to talk to mike .
what ?
what did you .. ? what did you do , ross ?
oh , boy . you got mad at that part .
i went over there , you know , to tell him how ..
how great you are . but ..
well , you know me . blah @-@ blah @-@ blah .
and i ended up telling him that ..
what ?
you had a six @-@ year @-@ long relationship ..
with a guy named vikram .
what ? why ?
well , he seemed ..
to bum hard when i told him you &apos;d never been in a serious relationship .
if you hadn &apos;t just had a baby with my best friend ..
i swear to lucifer ..
a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now !
i think you &apos;ll feel differently when you know ..
a little bit about vikram .
okay , he &apos;s a ..
he &apos;s a kite designer .
and he used to date oprah .
i &apos;m not going along with some lie you made up , ross .
i &apos;m just gonna be honest with him .
good .
just be honest with him .
i have nothing to be ashamed of .
no .
so i haven &apos;t been in a relationship that lasted longer than a month .
okay ? i haven &apos;t had a real boyfriend .
if he can &apos;t handle it , then he can leave . which he will .
and , you know , that &apos;s okay . so i &apos;ll just be alone forever .
you know , all right . it &apos;ll be fine . it &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ll go on walking tours with widows and lesbians .
i &apos;ll get it .
okay .
i &apos;m trying to remember the last time i opened a door and you weren &apos;t there .
phoebe , are you okay ?
yeah . there &apos;s just ..
there &apos;s something you should know .
vikram just called .
so it was really a shock after 25 years of marriage ..
my parents getting divorced . i took it the hardest ..
because i was the youngest .
sure . yeah .
how can you not remember me ?
what ?
how could you not remember that we slept together ?
what ? when ?
i don &apos;t know !
i really , really think i would remember sleeping with you .
come on , come on . search your brain , all right ? it was ..
a certain amount of time ago . i was here . you were here .
we had sex here , here , here ..
not there .
anything ?
no , it &apos;s not ringing any bells .
my god , woman !
how many people have you been with not to remember this ?
hey , hayley . we really gotta fix that doorknob .
joey ?
i slept with you !
and you obviously remember me ! hey , i still got it !
so we &apos;re good .
i &apos;ll let myself out .
and i said , &quot; okay , vikram ..
you can &apos;t just call every time you get lonely .
you gave up that right when you slept with rachel . &quot;
rachel ? i thought she just had a baby with ross .
yeah , well ..
yeah .
but emma &apos;s birth certificate might say &quot; geller .. &quot;
but her eyes say &quot; mukherjee . &quot;
that is so wrong . and on top of that , he &apos;s a glue sniffer ?
i know . but he calls , and my heart goes to him .
you know , that bastard is one smooth @-@ talking freelance kite designer .
if you want , i &apos;ll mess him up for you .
you would do that ?
unless he &apos;s big . if he &apos;s really big , i &apos;ll send him ..
a rude letter .
i think there &apos;s somebody better out there for you .
i mean , you know , i &apos;m .. i &apos;m not saying me , but ..
maybe .. me .
and you don &apos;t have to worry about glue @-@ sniffing with me .
although , i do smell the occasional magic marker .
yeah . anyway , i just ..
i think i can make you happy .
okay , i can &apos;t do this .
what &apos;s wrong ?
well , there is no vikram . ross made him up .
because i ..
i really never have been in a long @-@ term relationship .
i &apos;ve never lived with a guy . i &apos;ve never even celebrated an anniversary .
so ..
if that &apos;s too weird for you ..
and you want to leave , i understand .
in fact , i &apos;ll close my eyes to make it less awkward .
you kissed me .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a total freak ?
no .
well ..
look , can i .. ?
can i think you &apos;re a little weird and also cool ..
for telling me the truth and also want to kiss you ?
i guess so .
can i think it &apos;s cool that you kissed me ..
and also want to kiss you again ?
and be a little concerned about the magic markers ?
definitely .
this is vikram .
i need to talk to you about the long @-@ term relationship we had .
call me . i am in my kite @-@ making studio .
hi , honey , i &apos;m home .
hi .
how was your flight ?
it was great .
i ordered a pool float from the sky mall .
why &apos;d i do that ?
why don &apos;t you sit down .
get yourself comfortable .
because i have a little ..
surprise for you .
well , well , well . it must be 5 : 00 in tulsa ..
because it &apos;s &quot; sex o &apos;clock &quot; in n.y.c. !
okay . this is how much i love you .
the great white ..
honey ?
why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around ?
is this .. ? is this not the good part ?
do you want me to fast @-@ forward to something .. toothier ?
no , i &apos;m just not sure that you got the right movie , that &apos;s all .
this is the only one they had at our video store .
though they did have something called crocodile killers .
or does it always have to be sharks ?
does what always have to be sharks ?
look , we can do something else .
do you want me to get into the tub and .. thrash ?
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
i still love you .
let me be a part of this .
let me be a part of this !
i saw what you were doing in tulsa .
angry sharks turn you on !
no , they don &apos;t .
then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat ?
oh , my god ! when you came in , i switched the channel .
i was just watching regular porn .
really ?
yes . just some good , old @-@ fashioned , american , girl @-@ on @-@ girl action .
can i tell you how happy that makes me ?
you are an amazing wife .
really , you are amazing . you were actually gonna do this for me ?
where do you find the strength and the understanding for that ?
i &apos;m very , very drunk right now .
ordinarily , i would talk to her , but my confidence is shaken .
did i sleep with her ? did i not sleep with her ?
maybe this is a wake @-@ up call . you know , about your whole dating attitude .
you &apos;re in your 30s and you have never been in a long @-@ term relationship .
here you go from woman to woman ..
meaningless experience to meaningless experience .
never even worrying that it doesn &apos;t turn into something more serious .
you &apos;re right . i love my life !
