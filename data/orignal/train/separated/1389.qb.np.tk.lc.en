okay , okay.here she comes !
happy mother &apos;s day ... oh !
what are you wearing ?
you don &apos;t remember this shirt ?
you made it for me for mother &apos;s day in kindergarten .
it &apos;s adorable .
it &apos;s perverted .
it looks like you were felt up
by that creepy guy around the coner .
ew ! why him ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s got , like , freakishly tiny hands .
thank you !
i cannot believe you kept that shirt .
of course i kept it . i &apos;m your mother .
i keep everything you make me .
please take that off .
oh , when i &apos;m dead .
today is my special day ,
and i am gonna enjoy me some coffee .
you know that &apos;s a pencil holder , right ?
oh , i do now .
go first .
no , you can go first .
manny , go first !
no , jay , you go first .
ah , somebody give me a present !
oh , jay , a diamond necklace !
thank you !
you deserve it .
go ahead , kid .
happy mother &apos;s day , mom .
a necklace made of the froot loops !
i love it !
i know they &apos;re not exactly diamonds , mom .
no , they &apos;re beautiful .
you know what ? i got a confession to make .
those aren &apos;t real diamonds . no .
here , give them back . i &apos;ll get you some real ones later .
dang it . now i got to come clean .
these aren &apos;t real froot loops . they &apos;re generic .
now i have no presents again .
good morning !
hey , what &apos;s this ?
well , i know you &apos;ve had some late nights with lily ,
and this is just my way of saying &quot; thank you &quot; and &quot; i love you . &quot;
oh , thank you .
and this is just the beginning .
yeah , &apos; cause today is your day .
today ?
all day .
today . today is my day .
something &apos;s happening .
it mother &apos;s day , mitchell .
so ?
you &apos;re bringing me breakfast in bed on mother &apos;s day .
okay , no , no , this is not a mother &apos;s day breakfast .
this is breakfast that happens to be on --
you think of me as lily &apos;s mother !
i &apos;m your wife ! i &apos;m a woman ! !
what ?
honestly , i &apos;m a little offended that he accused me of that .
i &apos;m acally very sensitive to that issue .
like i would ever treat my partner as a woman .
somebody got new curtains .
well , mrs. pritchett loves to shop .
oh , we &apos;re never gonna be done by 6 : 00 .
better call home .
the wife &apos;s not gonna like this .
sometimes i think he just wants to be mad at me .
i can &apos;t eat !
okay , you know what ?
if you can &apos;t accept the nice gesture ,
then just forget it .
okay , scratch the balloons . she is in a mood .
i asked claire what she wanted for mother &apos;s day ,
and she said , &quot; take a hike . &quot;
it &apos;s not like that .
she &apos;s -- she &apos;s just bananas for walking around in nature .
um , so , she and -- and gloria
are taking the kids up the canyon
um , and jay and i are , uh , throwing on the aprons
and preparing a mother day feast .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s gonna be fun .
i know you want to leave me
but i refuse to -- - we &apos;re not doing that .
you know there are coyotes in these woods ?
did you pack a weapon ?
i have a walking stick .
does it become a sword ?
i guess it could become a running stick .
all right , you &apos;re gonna outrun a coyote ?
the fastest mammal in the world ?
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s true .
and how are you gonna fend them off with a popsicle stick ?
it &apos;s a spear .
and it smells like lemon @-@ lime ,
a flavor coyotes hate .
where are you getting your information ?
how much farther ?
well , i &apos;d like to go far enough
that we can &apos;t still see our car in the parking lot .
i &apos;m getting dust in my mouth .
you have to appreciate nature .
yes .
soon , this will be the mall .
i &apos;ll come then .
i &apos;m hungry .
i say we eat what we kill.ä½ 
oh , then i guess we &apos;ll be eating the mood .
i don &apos;t get you at all .
i know .
oh , is that the party over there ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m a woman , remember ?
i have a terrible sense of direction .
may i remind you that my big crime
was making you fluffy pancakes , okay ?
i &apos;m getting a little sick of you dwelling on this .
it happens to be mother &apos;s day , not martyr &apos;s day .
mitchell .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just a sensitive issue for me .
okay .
there &apos;s nothing gays hate more than when people ...
treat us like women .
treat us like women .
we &apos;re not .
we don &apos;t want to go to your baby shower .
we don &apos;t have a time of the month .
we don &apos;t love pink .
well , you love pink .
no , pink loves me .
okay .
hey , guys !
hey ! so ...
that &apos;s jen , husband rick , baby diego .
i don &apos;t get it either .
hey , jen . let me help you with that .
rick ! how you doing ?
we should do play group on weekends more often .
it &apos;s nice to have the husbands around to help , right ?
oh , yeah , because that makes all the sense in the world --
you as the husband .
stop it . that &apos;s not what she meant .
look at us . i could snap you like a twig .
okay , every once in a while you say that thing about the twig ,
and i need you to know that it bothers me .
sorry .
okay , everybody . happy mother &apos;s day !
i know i speak for all the guys
when i say thank you for everything you do
while we &apos;re off having affairs .
i &apos;m kidding . i &apos;ll pay for that later .
uh , let &apos;s get the moms and kids together for a picture !
no , let &apos;s go . let &apos;s get out of here .
leave the stroller and run .
cam , stop . no one &apos;s going to ask you to --
cameron , get on up here .
i don &apos;t know . you guys just go ahead .
you &apos;re an honorary mom !
oh , i don &apos;t know .
uh , okay , all right .
unhand me .
get over there .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s ...
okay , tighten up , tighten up .
up here , ladies !
beautiful . one more , gals .
oh , thanks , ladies . thanks so much . perfect .
great . okay .
yeah , that was definitely poison oak .
i think this rash is spreading .
manny , that &apos;s not a rash .
it &apos;s red because you scratch it .
i just don &apos;t want my throat to close .
wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing .
i &apos;m so bored , i &apos;d rather be reading .
i &apos;m so bored , i chewed the last bug
that flew in my mouth just to feel something .
i &apos;m so bored , i &apos;m talking to you .
ugh ! okay !
for the last 20 minutes ,
all you people have done is whine !
you would think on mother &apos;s day , at least ,
you would have something nice to say --
shh !
what ?
thought i heard a coyote . go ahead .
god , luke , you &apos;re such an idiot .
at least i don &apos;t look like an idiot .
what does that mean ?
your hat .
it &apos;s like you walked under a bird that poops ugly hats .
can we watch the language ?
there &apos;s nothing else to watch .
enough complaining !
you can &apos;t bitch all day
because you &apos;re not at the beach all day .
come on .
no . no , no .
i @-@ i &apos;m giving myself a mother &apos;s day present .
kids , your hike is over .
yes !
yeah !
no ! no , not happy .
bad . sad .
mm .
gloria and i are gonna go finish
this beautiful hike together while you sit here
and think about how selfish and thoughtless you &apos;ve been .
come on .
if we &apos;re thoughtless , how can we think ?
you just lost your water .
let &apos;s go .
what the hell are those ?
onion goggles . no more tears when i cook .
welcome to the 21st century . you should get a pair .
i was gonna suggest the same thing .
hey , jay , you know what we should put in this ?
we should add a da--
no .
it &apos;s my mom &apos;s recipe .
what it says on the page goes in the pot .
nothing more , nothing less .
now , how long do i stir the beef and sausages ?
read it to me .
you should stir the beef and sausages for five minutes .
and how much longer do i have to listen
to the julia child impression ?
for as long as it &apos;s still funny .
i think the timer just went off on that .
that was unnecessary .
what &apos;s this ?
what ? !
hey , jay , maybe after this ,
we should make &quot; the perfect mom . &quot;
all we need is &quot; a tablespoon of love , 1 cup of warmth ,
add one heart , softened . &quot;
what the hell are you talking about ?
this recipe for the perfect mom ,
by jay francis fritchett , age nine .
geez , i forgot all about that .
i didn &apos;t know she had that in there .
what &apos;s that , francis ?
nothing .
how much longer on the meat ?
i love the part about &quot; serves one small boy . &quot;
that &apos;s adorable .
&quot; 175 pounds of tenderness . &quot;
she must have loved that . big woman ?
jay ?
and that &apos;s when i saw it .
jay ...
are ...
are you crying ?
no !
it &apos;s the onions , damn it . give me these .
what are you lookin &apos; at ?
nothing .
those really frame your face .
beautiful .
ay , thank you .
okay , i don &apos;t want you to judge me ,
but i have to say something .
sometimes , i want to punch my kids .
you don &apos;t mean that .
no , i do . i do .
the last time they were horrible the way they were today ,
they happened to be all lined up .
and i couldn &apos;t help but think ,
&quot; if i hit just one of them ,
the rest would go down like dominos . &quot;
i know .
that would rob me of the pleasure
of hitting each one individually , but ...
oh , my god , you don &apos;t talk about your children this way .
oh , come on . you know manny irritates you .
no . manny is the best thing that ever happened to me .
we have a special bond .
yes , bonds . i know .
but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m talking about now .
claire , for a long time ,
it was only the two of us .
i cannot say anything bad about that boy .
give me a break , gloria !
anybody who &apos;s ever had a kid knows
that they can irritate the freaking life
out of you at some point .
am i right ?
oh . okay .
he &apos;s persnickety .
what ?
manny .
he &apos;s persnickety . it drives me up the wall .
okay , persnickety . good start .
he follows me around all the time .
sometimes i love it ,
but sometimes i need my own space .
this does not make you a bad mother to admit these things .
and the poetry . it &apos;s not very good .
ah . first time that i say that out loud .
okay .
it &apos;s not very good !
i @-@ i love manny , but , you know , sometimes i --
just be a boy !
go outside . kick a ball . steal something .
it feels so good !
maybe to you .
no , manny ! ay !
i was talking about another manny that i know long time ago !
diablo !
manny !
you know , more people have died hiking
than in the entire civil war ?
ok , what book did you read that in ?
book ?
wake up and smell the internet , grandma .
you know mom &apos;s just gonn want us to apologize .
well , we did kind of ruin her mother &apos;s day .
no , she ruined her mother &apos;s day .
she took us to a place
she knew we wouldn &apos;t like .
and then we complain for like a second ,
and we &apos;re the bad guys ?
that &apos;s a good point .
you ever get the feeling she does this intentionally ?
why would she do that ?
so she can make us feel guilty .
exactly .
and the next time we &apos;re choosing what to do ,
she gets her way again .
and the next time and the next time .
and eventually , it &apos;s mother &apos;s day every day .
wow . mom &apos;s really smart .
well , not smarter than me .
well ...
i say we don &apos;t apologize this time ,
let her know we &apos;re onto her little game .
we could change the way this whole family operates .
okay , so nobody says they &apos;re sorry .
got it ? keep your mouths shut when she comes back .
if she comes back .
jay teared up in front of me .
he &apos;d never shown me that kind of vulnerability ,
and it embarrassed him .
i &apos;d shamed the proud lion .
only thing to do ...
... hug the proud lion .
oh , i could get bit .
i could get scratched .
but you know what &apos;s inside every lion ?
a pussycat .
i need you to get away from me .
yep .
okay , i &apos;m just gonna say this one time
so we can move on .
it &apos;s okay .
gotcha .
you -- you know what &quot; it &quot; is ?
it &apos;s you crying .
which i didn &apos;t .
you teared up .
it was the onions .
okay , okay .
maybe i &apos;m -- maybe i &apos;m just putting myself in your place ,
but if i came across something from my childhood ,
and it reminded me of my mom , i might get a little misty ,
maybe even want to talk about it .
here .
so proud .
they offered me a bouquet , mitchell .
which you accepted .
why can &apos;t you ever take my side ?
they think of me as a woman !
cam , no , come on .
we &apos;re just a new type of family , you know ?
they don &apos;t have the right vocabulary for us yet .
they need one of us to be the mom .
so why does it have to be me ?
do i wear a dress ?
that &apos;s a nightshirt !
it &apos;s kind of satiny .
what are you saying ?
come on , you know .
no . no , no , no . i don &apos;t know .
all right , if i &apos;m thinking about it ,
of the two of us , if i had to pick ,
i might say that you &apos;re slightly ... mom @-@ er .
excuse me . can you throw that ball ?
can i throw a ball ?
you don &apos;t think i can throw a ball ?
cam
no , no , no .
that &apos;s not what he said .
no , apparently , this gentleman
doesn &apos;t think i can throw a ball .
oh , that &apos;s not what he said .
you think i can &apos;t throw a ball ? well , let &apos;s find out !
oo god . he looks old .
oh , sorry !
cam , hands .
sorry !
there you go .
manny , i didn &apos;t mean any of it .
please forgive me !
i don &apos;t think i can . let &apos;s just get in the van .
oh . sorry for the rhyme .
i know how you &quot; hate my poetry . &quot;
please , stop my suffering !
say something terrible about me
so that we can be even like steven .
why would i say something terrible to someone i love ?
i curse my tongue !
i &apos;m gonna intervene here .
manny , let &apos;s talk about what really happened , okay ?
your mom said you should go out and throw a ball around .
that can &apos;t be the first time you &apos;ve heard that .
no . but there was some hurtful stuff said about my poetry .
which your mom regrets .
i do !
so ? that &apos;s what parents are for .
sometimes they criticize because it helps make you stronger .
kids these days get trophies just for showing up .
what &apos;s that gonna lead to ?
a bunch of 30 @-@ year @-@ olds living at home .
manny , your mom loves you very much .
but she &apos;s a human being .
so she let off a little steam .
honestly , it &apos;s probably a great thing for your relationship .
i guess i can
stop .
he needs to know the real truth .
manny , claire was feeling bad
because she wants to hit her own children ,
so i tried to make her feel better
by inventing terrible things about you .
you mean you don &apos;t have a problem with my poetry ?
no , the only problem that i have
is that i never have enough of it .
you &apos;re the perfect kid in every way .
ay , mi amor
wow . that &apos;s healthy .
good . you &apos;re back .
are we done ?
unless the you have something to say
to the person who gave you life on her special day .
nope .
i &apos;m good .
my baby , luke ?
no .
here . what &apos;s this ?
well , it &apos;s a mother &apos;s day card .
and i know -- stop it ! okay .
cam , that was gloria &apos;s card from manny
but i just wanted you to see
what its definition for &quot; mother &quot; was on it .
it &apos;s warm , nurturing , supportive .
you know , maybe when the world sees you as a mom --
not just the world .
fine . fine . me too .
but maybe this is what we &apos;re seeing ,
and i don &apos;t know why that &apos;s such a bad thing .
it certainly doesn &apos;t make you less of a man , right ?
maybe you &apos;re right .
yeah .
come on , let &apos;s join the party .
and , cam , put down the scotch .
you &apos;re not fooling anyone .
it is so burn @-@ y . oh , my god .
come on , people ! everybody to the table !
it &apos;s just hard , you know ?
having your mother &apos;s day ruined .
i never thought it would be you , lucas .
don &apos;t even think about it .
but she &apos;s sad .
sad she &apos;s losing .
she just hit you with her best shot .
we need to stay strong .
but i feel--
don &apos;t feel !
just go splash water on your face and man up !
we &apos;re your mother now .
how was your day with my dad ?
awkward , actually .
he , um ... he cried a little .
my dad ? !
shh !
dad what ?
he cried .
no , i didn &apos;t say he cried .
who cried ?
my dad .
stop !
why would you make jay sob like that ?
i didn &apos;t make him sob .
he teared up when i found this poem
he wrote for his mom as a boy .
what is &quot; ohh &quot; ?
phil saw dad cry .
jay misses his mama .
everybody , stop !
is anybody hungry ?
what ?
you cried for your mommy ?
oh , crap . i did not .
yes , phil just told us--
no , that &apos;s not true . she &apos;s a liar .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
look , i know you would all be so happy
if you thought i had some big emotional moment
about my mom , but i didn &apos;t .
so you don &apos;t miss your mom ?
of course i do . she was a great lady .
and she also left me a fantastic recipe for sauce ,
which now is getting cold .
so can we please eat ?
hear , hear !
just grab some wine .
oh , my gosh , smell that .
it smells like grandma &apos;s house .
hey , you guys remember that ?
i remember the first time i cut spaghetti .
eh @-@ eh !
that &apos;s what she did ! eh @-@ eh !
yeah , no , you can &apos;t cut spaghetti .
she taught me to twirl .
oh , so she &apos;s the one .
yeah , she was tough .
i remember i had this little league coach .
and one time after a game ,
he was laying into me about something .
i don &apos;t remember .
but mom comes charging out of the stands .
she goes right up to the guy --
i mean , face to face , nose to nose --
and she says to him , &quot; let me tell you something --
&quot; nobody , and i mean nobody ,
&quot; yells at my little
boy . &quot;
oh , my god ! it &apos;s happening again !
it &apos;s okay , jay . let it out .
let it out .
you only get one mom .
i &apos;m sorry , mom !
me too !
a bottle of red , a bottle of -- what ? !
oh , yeah , and i &apos;m the weak one .
mitchell ?
oh , i &apos;m good .
phil !
dad !
come on , honey !
i &apos;m sorry .
ew , get off of me !
i &apos;m sorry !
dada !
oh , i think she &apos;s calling you .
don &apos;t even try .
i have that pottery class in the morning .
jay , let &apos;s go to bed .
be right up .
