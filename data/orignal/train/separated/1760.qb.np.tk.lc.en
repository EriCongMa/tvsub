i was unstoppable .
i mean , i was ... i was on fire .
it was like my mind and my body were totally connected ,
like @-@ like athletes must feel when they &apos;re in the zone .
again , it was miniature golf .
admit it , you &apos;re a little turned on .
you can &apos;t be this proud .
why not ?
because i beat you .
oh , good . you &apos;re back .
we have some exciting news .
okay .
as you know , amy and i have been together a long time ,
and a lot of things i never thought possible
now seem possible .
okay ...
after a careful evaluation of our relationship ,
we decided that the time was right to
take a step forward .
okay .
do you want to say it ?
let &apos;s say it together .
we &apos;re getting a turtle !
this is why i &apos;ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice .
sarcasm ?
yes .
okay .
that was tricky , &apos; cause when it comes to alcohol ,
she generally means business .
well , we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re very happy for you .
yes .
thank you .
acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us .
no . it &apos;s true .
it means that we care so much about each other ,
there &apos;s enough left over for an eight @-@ ounce reptile .
why a turtle ?
after much deliberation , we &apos;ve determined that a turtle
is the ideal pet .
they don &apos;t shed fur , they don &apos;t make noise ...
for halloween , we can dress him as a cobblestone .
and if he ever goes berserk , i know i can outrun him .
coincidentally , that &apos;s also why i chose you as a roommate .
well , congratulations .
who would &apos;ve thought you two would be the first
in our group to start a family ?
that &apos;s what i said !
so , where &apos;s your roommate tonight ?
well , i thought it was a little unfair
that she &apos;s always here ,
and you never get a chance to stay over , so ...
i killed her .
but remember our agreement ?
you can joke about murdering people ,
but you have to say , &quot; just kidding . &quot;
and the more important thing to remember is
that i &apos;d never hurt you .
oh , crap .
i have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient .
that &apos;s okay . i can come back later .
no . no , don &apos;t be silly .
i won &apos;t be gone long . just stay here .
okay , cool .
oh , and you &apos;re sure your roommate &apos;s not gonna come back
while i &apos;m here alone , right ?
&apos;cause that &apos;ll be awkward .
oh , don &apos;t worry . she &apos;s in palm springs .
oh , good .
well , her torso is .
just kidding .
i put her in a wood chipper .
oh , dear lord . oh , dear lord .
it &apos;s okay .
you made it . we &apos;re fine .
that was a lot of puppies .
let &apos;s forget about them , and ...
pick ourselves out a nice turtle .
oh , how about this one up on the log ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
he kind of looks like a jerk .
how about this one ?
well , he &apos;s barely moving . he looks half dead .
i know . i like him , too .
hi , little guy .
how &apos;d you like to come home with us ?
you &apos;ll be living with me
because we don &apos;t live in the same house .
but that &apos;s not your fault .
like you , we &apos;re taking it ridiculously slow .
you &apos;ll stay with me when he &apos;s at comic @-@ con or away for work .
or if they accept daddy &apos;s application to live on mars .
what are you talking about ?
oh , there &apos;s this company
that &apos;s attempting to establish a colony on mars ,
and i applied to be among the first to go .
what should we name him ?
you know , i came in thinking &quot; seth , &quot; but ...
he kind of looks italian .
you applied for a mission
to be a colonist on another planet ,
and couldn &apos;t be bothered to tell me ?
would you have approved ?
of course not .
well , based on your reaction ,
it looks like i made the right choice .
isn &apos;t that right , giuseppe ?
listen , i @-@ i have a little confession to make .
aw , is this your first time ?
no , i got you something for valentine &apos;s day ,
and i was too embarrassed to give it to you .
well , why ?
well , &apos; cause i got it at the dirty store .
you went to the dirty store without me ? !
in sunglasses and a hat after i parked two blocks away .
well , get it ! get it for me !
yeah ?
yeah .
okay , uh , well , i hope it &apos;s fun .
i mean , it @-@ it comes with paints , and @-@ and
it &apos;s kind of creative and artistic .
okay , did you go to the dirty store or michaels ?
no , no .
we cover ourselves in body paint ,
and then @-@ then we get on this big canvas and do our thing .
whoa , that &apos;s kind of a big step for a guy
who only recently agreed to take his socks off .
you &apos;re making fun of me . forget it .
no ! no , come on , i want to do it .
really ?
yeah , let &apos;s you , me ,
and your very , very pale feet make some art .
hey , when you got back to this store , i want to go with you .
okay , but it &apos;s a drive--
the one i went to is in san diego .
how are the taxes going ?
okay .
but you got a lot of receipts for the lego store in here .
those are business expenses .
you can write those off .
a $ 200 r2 @-@ d2 is a business expense ?
oh , bernie ,
you &apos;re gonna have to sound a lot more confident
when we get audited .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
eh , emily ran back to the hospital ,
so i &apos;m just hanging out at her place .
what are you , uh , what are you doing ?
just playing video games while bernie does the taxes .
what are you , a little kid ?
is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces , too ?
she doesn &apos;t have to-- i filled up on jelly beans .
so , uh , what game are you ...
crap .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t get emily &apos;s nightstand to close .
so ?
she &apos;s gonna know i was looking in it .
why were you looking in it ?
well , there &apos;s a question
i better have a good answer to before she gets back .
okay , calm down .
there &apos;s probably something jammed behind it .
just , uh , pull it out and see what &apos;s there .
hang on .
oh ... no . oh , no .
oh , god , no !
you know what , you sound busy-- i &apos;m gonna let you go .
dude , the whole front came off .
now she &apos;s gonna know i was snooping .
what &apos;s happening ?
raj was snooping through emily &apos;s drawers and broke one .
i &apos;m gonna miss her .
so what do you think ?
i thought it &apos;d be a little more ...
just more .
i &apos;m not even sure why we were out of breath .
uh , i mean , d @-@ did we move at all ?
maybe along the z @-@ axis ,
but x and y are looking pretty sad .
okay , come on . we are not old boring people .
we can do better than this .
uh , th @-@ that &apos;s true .
how late did we stay up last night ?
almost 1 : 00 a.m.
damn straight , almost 1 : 00 a.m.
and we weren &apos;t even watching tv .
we were watching netflix , like the kids do .
yeah , is it a comedy ? is it a drama ?
nobody knows .
now , come on . we are gonna do this .
yeah . you get the paint ,
i &apos;ll rest for 30 @-@ 40 minutes ,
and then we do this !
i can &apos;t believe you almost had me bring
a wild animal into my home .
no one told you to poke the turtle &apos;s face .
i was playing &quot; got your nose . &quot;
that &apos;s how you get children to like you .
i &apos;m surprised you even care if he likes you ,
since you &apos;re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get .
ugh , this again .
amy , i &apos;ve already had one new hole torn in my body today .
i don &apos;t need another one .
sheldon , i know the odds of you
even going to mars are incredibly small ,
but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something
that would take you away from me forever .
so you &apos;re saying you wouldn &apos;t leave me
for the chance to be one of the first humans
to colonize another planet ?
i would at least mention it
before filling out the application .
huh , that &apos;s exactly what leonard , wolowitz , koothrappali ,
bernadette and penny said .
and who says you could even survive
an interplanetary mission , anyway ?
you could barely survive a tiny turtle bite .
first of all , this ...
has only made me stronger .
but beyond that , all i did
was fill out an application .
you know what ?
go to mars , sheldon .
is there anything i can do to cheer you up ?
no . forget it .
what if i play the star trek theme on my nose ?
please don &apos;t .
yep , you &apos;re mad .
okay , let me see the damage .
hang on .
well , i think you broke the dowels .
you &apos;re not gonna have time to glue it back on--
you &apos;ll have to nail it .
with what ?
does she have any pillows or wine glasses ?
she does .
great .
neither of those . try a hammer !
did that feel good ?
you feel like a big man now ?
i was going to make you red zinger ,
but since mars is the red planet ,
i went with peppermint .
why do you even want to do this ?
actually ...
as part of the application ,
i was required to make a short video
answering that very question .
you want to see it ?
can &apos;t you just tell me ?
but i made a video .
i &apos;m dr. sheldon cooper ,
and i &apos;d like to tell you why i should be chosen to ...
go to mars !
i &apos;m exceedingly smart .
i graduated college at 14 .
while my brother was getting an std
i was getting a phd .
penicillin can &apos;t take this away .
being in close quarters , cleanliness is important
and ... my hygiene is impeccable .
in fact , animals don &apos;t trust me
because i smell like nothing .
yeah ...
literally nothing .
during the seven @-@ month space flight ,
i can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humor .
hey , leonard ...
is there any peanut brittle left in that can ?
you mean this weirdly suspicious one ?
yes . open it and check .
i don &apos;t get it .
there &apos;s actually peanut brittle in ...
please go to mars .
but on a more serious note :
the most important reason i want to go to mars is that
i believe , as a scientist ,
it &apos;s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward .
now , i know that life on mars will be difficult .
but life here on earth is no picnic .
also , picnics are no picnic .
where should we go for lunch ?
oh , i know , the ground .
in conclusion ,
thank you for considering me
for this journey of a lifetime .
to mars !
afterwards , leonard blew his nose ,
and pie came out .
right there , right there ,
oh , god , that &apos;s it !
how did you get paint in your eye ?
because you wouldn &apos;t let me wear safety goggles !
this looks terrible .
she @-@ she &apos;s gonna know .
it &apos;s fine .
you just need two more nails .
okay , where should i put them ?
in emily &apos;s eyes .
you &apos;re not helping .
well , maybe this is what you get for snooping .
you know , it @-@ it &apos;s bad enough that i have to deal with this ...
raj ? i &apos;m back .
oh , no .
how was the hospital ?
fine .
what were you doing in there ?
uh ... w @-@ well ...
okay , look , i @-@ i don &apos;t want to lie to you .
i @-@ i got curious , i was looking around ...
and i broke the drawer on your night stand .
you were looking in my night stand ?
yeah .
so , the first time i leave you alone ,
you snoop on me ?
you &apos;ve never snooped around my apartment ?
no !
come on , think back .
it would really help if you had !
i can &apos;t believe you don &apos;t trust me !
she sounds really mad .
we should hang up .
yeah , we should .
but we &apos;re not going to , are we ?
not a chance .
what happened to &quot; snooping is wrong &quot; ?
howard , you &apos;re going to jail for tax fraud .
who cares ?
well , we did it .
we sure did .
i mean , i was on fire !
i @-@ i was in the zone , like an athlete .
sweetie , i beat you at this , too .
so , where do we want to hang it ?
what ? are you kidding ?
we &apos;re not hanging it !
but it &apos;s an expression of our love .
and our butts ! not hanging it !
seems a shame to throw it away .
yeah .
we could give it to sheldon ,
and tell him william shatner painted it .
god , i love you . i love you so much .
i think i &apos;m gonna go home .
why ?
i really don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening here .
you know , sheldon , at any other time ,
learning that you had plans to go live on mars
would be a slow news day .
but a couple of hours ago ,
we were getting a turtle .
and silly as it sounds ,
i thought that meant something .
amy !
oh , why didn &apos;t i give her sleepy time tea ?
amy , wait !
getting a turtle meant a great deal to me , too .
sure .
unless something better comes along .
do you want me to withdraw my application ?
what i want is for us
to be planning our future together .
and in that future ,
are we on the same planet ?
yeah , because i &apos;ve seen people make the long @-@ distance thing work .
we &apos;re on the same planet !
okay !
does that planet have to be earth ?
are you asking me to go to mars with you ?
i am .
yeah , if i &apos;m going to a barren , lifeless environment ,
where the chances of survival are slim to none ,
i want you there with me .
why don &apos;t we go back to the apartment ,
and fill out your application ?
okay .
i suppose being the first people
on a new planet would be incredibly exciting .
oh , i know .
we could be the first to plant a flag on mars .
we could be the first to watch mars attacks ! on mars .
we could be the first to say
&quot; good lord , what on mars are you talking about ? &quot;
you know ,
we could also be the first people
to procreate on mars .
you just can &apos;t keep it in your space pants , can you ?
think about it .
if we had a family there ,
our kids would be martians .
they would , wouldn &apos;t they ?
we could give them cool martian names .
and we could teach them about martian history .
like , who planted those flags ?
and , uh , where did that copy of mars attacks ! come from ?
i guess we &apos;ll have to make a new video together , as a couple .
good idea .
and since you &apos;ve had such a rough day ,
i &apos;m gonna let you throw the pie in leonard &apos;s face .
thank you for forgiving me .
it &apos;s okay .
at some point , we were bound to have our first fight .
well , it almost happened when you called
my apple pie crust &quot; doughy . &quot;
the truth is you were right .
and i was just angry at myself .
can i ask you one thing ?
of course . what ?
did you look in my closet ?
no . just the drawer .
you promise you didn &apos;t look in the closet ?
i promise .
why , what &apos;s in there ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
good night .
