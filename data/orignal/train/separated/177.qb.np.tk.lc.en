gossip girl here ...
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you really like olivia , right ?
yeah , yeah , i do .
don &apos;t you think that
dating a movie star is gonna be kind of hard ?
we are completely monogamous .
it &apos;s just one of our games .
chuck plays the cheating bastard ,
and i play the scorned woman .
what happens when one day you don &apos;t get there in time ,
and he actually kisses someone else ?
my parents are artists .
my sister &apos;s a musician .
just like going to an ivy is your family &apos;s way ,
not going to college is mine .
i met this woman .
i knew they &apos;d take care of my debts , so i proposed .
so what , you just disappeared ?
it &apos;s the worst thing i &apos;ve ever done .
do you think the buckleys would actually hurt him ?
they might .
they clearly want revenge .
but what truly defines
tonight &apos;s honored guest
is not something that can be easily categorized ...
the distinguished @-@ looking gentleman at the podium
is an alumnus of the university .
he will go on speaking for a long time .
it is not important that you hear what he says .
in closing , those of us at the university
will have had the pleasure
of getting to know tonight &apos;s recipient ,
know that she is a kind and gentle soul .
hey , you okay ?
what ? no . no , i am not okay .
... her humility , her devotion , her love for us .
ladies and gentlemen ,
miss vanessa abrams .
no .
no !
no !
bad dream ?
don &apos;t tell me it was &quot; charade &quot; again .
i know how terrifying you find walter matthau .
worse . i was in &quot; all about eve . &quot;
that &apos;s not a hepburn movie .
i know .
i was bette davis .
i &apos;ve never been bette davis before .
i &apos;m audrey hepburn ,
not some plain baby jane .
who was eve ?
i couldn &apos;t see her face .
blair , we both know this is about n.y.u.
now it may take time ,
but one day you will hold that school
in the palm of your dainty hand .
i &apos;m audrey .
i &apos;m audrey .
well , thank you , councilman .
i know my cousin appreciates your support .
yes , i &apos;ll be sure to tell him . thanks .
when did tripp decide to run for congress ?
and should somebody tell him
the election is not until next year ?
well , after congressman kruger died ,
a house seat opened up in manhattan .
you know grandfather . he figured , why wait ?
well , it &apos;s nice of you to help .
well , tripp &apos;s a good guy ,
and with the buckleys buying up all these attack ads
against his campaign , i &apos;m taking it kind of personally .
yeah . have you ... have you spoken to bree lately ?
no . you spoken to carter ?
not since my mom &apos;s wedding .
i &apos;ve left him a dozen messages .
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s mad at me or ...
well , serena , that &apos;s why i called .
supposedly the buckleys are flying him out to galveston
so he can work off his debt .
work it off , how ?
on one of the family oil rigs .
th @-@ that &apos;s crazy . it would take him , like , 20 years
to earn that kind of money .
i think they &apos;re more interested in getting carter
out to the gulf with a bunch of texas roughnecks .
so it &apos;s not like he &apos;s going to be making a lot of friends .
no , please tell me this is a joke .
don &apos;t worry . i have an idea .
yes . yes . lily loves her jefferson airplane .
so , rufus , how is married life ?
well , at the risk of sounding like a man deeply in love ,
uh , each day gets better than the one before .
it must be ,
if you &apos;re packing these &quot; welcome back , kotter &quot; mugs .
they &apos;ll look great next to lily &apos;s china .
yeah , maybe we should hold off on the sweathogs .
&quot; in just a few short months ,
freshman leader vanessa abrams
has tackled numerous social and environmental issues . &quot;
what is that ?
oh , it &apos;s just a wildly flattering cover story
on vanessa in the n.y.u. paper .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
except that she &apos;s a shoo @-@ in to give the toast
at the freshman dinner on parents &apos; weekend .
dan , can i borrow your muscles ?
is that true ? about the toast ?
i ... i got a message from josh ellis .
he &apos;s the alumnus who decides who gives the toast .
supposedly it &apos;s between me and some other girl .
i probably won &apos;t get it .
well , speech or no speech ,
i @-@ i hope you &apos;re inviting your parents .
you &apos;re kidding , right ? my parents hate
that i &apos;m at a private college , &quot; buying &quot; an elitist education .
&quot; knowledge shouldn &apos;t be for sale . &quot;
sure , arlo and gabriela are progressive ,
but if they knew
how much good you were doing at the school ,
i &apos;m sure they &apos;d come around .
it would be kind of amazing if they came
and , you know ,
actually approved of something i was doing .
but whatever . i haven &apos;t been chosen yet , so ...
well , you will be .
and tomorrow night ,
dan and i will be there front and center .
oh , um , yeah , you know what ?
actually , olivia just got back from japan .
i was hoping we would hang out tomorrow night .
so bring olivia .
or not . it &apos;s your call . i @-@ i don &apos;t want to force you .
what ? what ? we ... we just started dating .
isn &apos;t it a little soon for meet the parents ?
not for olivia .
she seems really easygoing and into you .
yeah , seriously , dan . play the parent card .
people like you more when they meet our family .
it &apos;s true .
all right . okay . a @-@ all right . i &apos;ll invite her .
oh , that &apos;s awesome .
it &apos;s gonna be a great night for the humphreys .
and who knows ? maybe the abramses .
wait . bree &apos;s cousin hosts a poker game ?
yeah , p.j. buckley . picture , like , a young j.r. ewing
in earnest sewn jeans .
and you really think he &apos;ll play for carter &apos;s debt ?
oh , i &apos;ve seen his friends bet thoroughbreds ,
an island in the seychelles , the knicks .
okay , but what makes you think we &apos;ll win ?
you &apos;re not exactly a card shark .
well , this one night at the maidstone ,
bree told me every one of p.j. &apos; s tells .
so you &apos;ll know exactly when to call his bluff .
wait . me ?
oh , yeah . you &apos;re gonna be playing .
nate .
no .
well , serena , p.j. hates me .
i mean , luckily , he likes blondes , though .
and didn &apos;t you spend a summer
in monte carlo with your mom
when she dated carlos mortensen ?
i was 9 .
carlos taught me to play using necco wafers as chips .
well , just imagine carter owes the buckleys
half a million necco wafers .
... &quot; and ms. abrams has even been mentioned
&quot; as a contender to deliver this year &apos;s toast
at the freshman dinner . &quot;
oh , my god . enough .
i am in no mood to hear you fawn over some girl
with tacky accessories who lives to recycle .
blair , didn &apos;t you ask mr. ellis
if you could give the freshman speech ?
i put out feelers . that &apos;s totally different .
of course . i &apos;d be honored , mr. ellis . thank you .
you .
yeah , blair , me .
f.y.i .... one insipid article
does not mean people here like you .
the fever will pass , like swine flu .
really ? huh . then i wonder why josh ellis ...
he &apos;s this kind of important alumni liaison ...
told me to start working on
my toast for the freshman dinner .
what are you standing there for ? get in here !
i love it . you know , cobalt &apos;s my favorite color .
push the button .
it &apos;s 11 : 45 .
your hair is so pleasing .
it &apos;s a compliment watch .
and it flatters in three different languages .
oh , my god .
this is the greatest watch in the history of all watches .
the swiss should be ashamed for not thinking of it first .
so , um , what are you gonna do this weekend to thank me ?
uh , you know , actually , um , about that ,
i was thinking i would invite you
to the parents &apos; weekend freshman dinner
with , uh , with me and my parents .
and i @-@ i know you &apos;re probably exhausted .
i would love to .
really ? are you sure ?
&apos;cause you heard the part about my parents , right ?
dan , the last three guys i dated ...
i met their agent , their manager ,
their publicist ,
a personal trainer who also read tarot cards ,
and i never met a single one of their parents .
i would love to meet yours .
i missed you .
it &apos;s 11 : 46 .
your teeth shine like diamonds .
it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s very true .
you &apos;ve reached arlo and gabriela abrams .
pay it forward .
hey , mom , dad .
look , i know you guys aren &apos;t happy that i &apos;m at n.y.u. ,
but i &apos;m giving this toast tomorrow night ,
and it &apos;s kind of a big honor .
and it would mean so , so much to me if you came ,
so i hope you can .
careful , v.
don &apos;t send out your invitations just yet .
we hear another girl has her eyes on the prize .
montesquieu , churchill , hobbes ...
i &apos;m thinking my toast should touch on ...
tradition , virtue ,
the divine right of the monarchy .
but , blair , vanessa &apos;s giving the toast .
not when i &apos;m done .
mao , sun @-@ tzu , of course ,
napoleon &apos;s always good for a few zingers .
though things are rarely as simple as they appear .
this is josh ellis .
well , i &apos;m thrilled he changed your mind .
of course we &apos;d still love to have you give the toast .
yes , there was another girl ,
but we hadn &apos;t fully committed to her .
we definitely want you .
great , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow , mr. ellis .
good @-@ bye , jet lag . hello , triple ristretto .
yes .
what was that ?
just a surprise .
and something tells me we &apos;re in for a show .
now , ms. waldorf , if this is about
letting you give the freshman toast ,
like i told you last week , i &apos;d love to help you out , but
actually , mr. ellis , i &apos;m here to help you .
simply put , vanessa abrams
is a tired clich from the 7 @-@ 1 @-@ 8 .
the preachy &quot; i hate the man &quot; toast
she no doubt has in mind won &apos;t inspire the kind of
deep @-@ pocket donations this school needs .
you need a speaker more like , well , me .
ms. waldorf , yes , last week i narrowed my search
down to two candidates . but just moments ago ,
our first choice , olivia burke , accepted our invitation .
then why does activist abrams
still think she &apos;s giving the toast ?
vanessa was the other student that we were considering .
you see , initially , olivia wasn &apos;t planning on attending ,
but then luckily , for everyone ,
her new boyfriend convinced her otherwise .
yes , she is very famous .
mm @-@ hmm . but she &apos;s a 2 @-@ quadrant speaker .
is it smart to lose everyone over 25 on parents &apos; weekend ?
besides , actresses are notoriously unreliable .
ms. waldorf , even if olivia &apos;s schedule did change ,
vanessa would still be my next choice .
so ... i &apos;m very busy .
i &apos;ll see you soon , mom .
oh , no . you are not trying to steal my toast .
nobody told you .
olivia , your dear roommate , is giving the toast .
poor vanessa .
always the understudy , never the star .
olivia &apos;s the other girl ?
and i was the one who told dan to bring her .
irony certainly can be cruel .
did i overhear your long @-@ absent mother
is coming to hear you speak ? tragic .
well , i &apos;ll just tell olivia how much this toast means to me ,
and then she &apos;ll step down .
yeah , probably . though , then again , she might not .
nice try , blair .
well , i &apos;m just saying , we all know olivia loves the spotlight .
she is an actress .
then i &apos;ll ask dan not to bring her .
another idea with some merit .
see , that &apos;s where you and i are different .
i would never put my fate in someone else &apos;s hands ,
and that &apos;s why i always win , and you lose .
so good luck with your honesty .
maybe you and mom could take in a show instead .
nate archibald . you looking for a game ?
i &apos;m afraid we don &apos;t have a seat for you .
oh , i &apos;m not here to play . she is .
that is unless you &apos;re afraid to play a girl .
buy @-@ in &apos;s $ 25,000 .
that &apos;s a lot of money .
so don &apos;t lose .
pull up a seat , darlin &apos; .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
you &apos;re the one who told me to invite her .
i know .
remember the whole &quot; people like you better
when they meet your family &quot; thing ?
exactly , you don &apos;t want to be outshone by your family ,
and not to mention , she &apos;s been in japan for ten days .
i mean , she &apos;s probably having reverse culture shock .
yeah , okay , all right .
so do you have any , uh , non @-@ insane reasons ?
well , i &apos;m just saying , why don &apos;t you do something
more casual but also romantic ?
dinner , just the two of you .
you can make your special chicken .
my special chicken ? what ?
vanessa , what is going on ?
nothing .
uh @-@ huh . i need a refill .
okay , but you have to promise me you won &apos;t say anything ,
because this officially makes me the worst roommate ever .
just tell me .
olivia &apos;s freaking out about meeting your parents .
what ? i talked to her , like , two hours ago ,
and she said she was looking forward to it .
i guess she changed her mind ,
or doesn &apos;t want to hurt your feelings .
she just feels that it &apos;s way , way too soon .
yeah . you know , i knew , i knew this was gonna happen .
really ? i mean , yeah , of course . and i know this is my fault ,
but tell her you want to have a great night ,
just the two of you .
and make my special chicken ?
i &apos;ll give you a recipe .
okay .
hey , abrams , thank you for , uh , the heads @-@ up .
what are friends for ?
trip queens .
it doesn &apos;t feel right ,
you know , taking a beautiful woman &apos;s money .
i &apos;m getting crushed here .
hey , don &apos;t worry .
p.j. &apos; s on tilt . this is where you hook him .
archibald , you want to call it a night ?
i can spot you cab fare .
just get him to bet carter and remember the tells .
actually , p.j. , we &apos;re gonna buy back in .
but we &apos;re upping the stakes .
what are you thinking of playing for ?
yeah , not likely .
how about carter baizen ?
i get it . you &apos;re ... you &apos;re carter &apos;s girl .
well , bad news , sweetheart ,
carter &apos;s debt is a lot more than you &apos;re showing .
you know , can we get some , uh , some privacy ?
i tell you what . you bet carter ,
and i &apos;ll bet ...
a photo of tripp van der bilt ...
from the night of his bachelor party .
your family will kill you .
that &apos;ll cost tripp the election . -
like i said , don &apos;t lose .
let &apos;s play some cards .
i &apos;m sorry to cancel on you like this ,
mr. ellis .
you have a backup speaker , right ?
okay . good .
all right . uh , good @-@ bye .
everything okay ?
um , dan has decided to cook dinner for me
instead of going out with his parents .
he probably just wants more one @-@ on @-@ one time .
i &apos;ll bet he has something special planned , like chicken .
yeah .
or something .
yeah . um , i brought you this . it &apos;s an anime goblin claw .
they are huge in japan right now .
i just thought it was kind of funny .
thanks .
i shouldn &apos;t be freaking out , right ?
i mean , i can meet his parents anytime .
yeah .
um , i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
hi , mr. ellis .
no .
i &apos;d still love to give the toast .
thank you .
tell machiavelli i hope she enjoys my toast .
vanessa &apos;s giving the toast again .
and she &apos;s got some big pink claw thing .
well , i don &apos;t know about that .
however , phase one is complete .
but even with olivia out of the way ,
you still don &apos;t have the toast .
oh , my goodness .
you &apos;re right .
thank you , amalia .
when are you going to learn to have a little faith ?
chuck , my love ,
i was thinking , remember our game from the summer ?
well , i have the perfect target already picked out .
so what &apos;s a sweet girl like you
doing with a guy like carter baizen , hmm ?
you heard what happened to my sister , right ?
heartbroken ,
30 pounds fatter .
bet .
$ 20,000 .
all in .
you sure you want to play this hand for carter ?
fine .
i &apos;ll call .
kings .
aces .
you know , a picture really is worth a thousand words .
or in this case ,
an election .
nate , thanks for stopping by .
looks like carter &apos;s going down to texas ,
and tripp &apos;s career is going up in smoke .
hey . you made it .
hey .
rufus !
oh ! come here . would you let me look at you ?
lay off the caffeine , huh ? it &apos;s giving you wrinkles .
ah . i &apos;m sorry arlo couldn &apos;t make it .
he says hello .
he had to finish installing the solar panels
on the chicken coop at the co @-@ op .
we have been so busy organizing the local 72,
the , uh , the union for the burlington cheesemakers .
aha . yeah .
yeah .
mom , this is lily .
oh , it is such a pleasure to finally meet vanessa &apos;s mother .
gabriela .
oh , rufus ... we &apos;re not in brooklyn anymore .
uh , uh , i &apos;m still moving in . it &apos;s lily &apos;s place .
oh , it is both of our place .
uh , mom , didn &apos;t you bring that for lily ?
oh , yes , i did . homemade strawberry rhubarb .
thank you .
oh . mmm .
well , you and your husband must be so proud of vanessa .
oh , yes . vanessa has always been
a very thoughtful and driven young woman .
this school is the perfect fit for her .
well ...
here we go .
to be completely honest ,
my husband and i don &apos;t believe in private universities .
knowledge should not be for sale .
well ... well ...
yes . oh .
who &apos;s hungry ?
lovely .
i must confess , i &apos;ve missed our little game .
though it appears your lady is late .
actually , there she is now .
she &apos;s a guy .
who took my speech at the freshman dinner
and gave it to vanessa abrams .
he double @-@ crossed me , and i ...
demand satisfaction .
you still up for it ?
mm , my wonderful man .
i &apos;ll just go powder my nose for ten minutes ?
i only need five .
can i help you ?
oh , definitely .
i don &apos;t know if p.j. is not as stupid as he looks ,
but , nate , those tells were wrong .
what are you gonna do ?
well , of course i had to tell my grandfather what happened .
i mean , i have completely destroyed tripp &apos;s political career .
no . no , nate . let me talk to him . please .
he needs to know that you were trying to help me .
i appreciate that , but i &apos;m not dragging you into this mess .
oh , it &apos;s william right here .
nate .
no . serena , i can handle it .
hello , grandfather .
ugh .
is , uh , nate archibald in there ?
he &apos;s got a phone call ... p.j. buckley .
okay . yeah . i &apos;ll tell him . thank you .
p.j. thinks he won the picture .
yeah , i have the real one .
i mean , i feel bad about lying to serena
but it worked .
okay .
gabriela , this strawberry rhubarb jam to die for .
thank you . it &apos;s the agave . i refuse to use sugar .
mmm . mm @-@ hmm .
oh , rufus , will we be seeing daniel at the dinner ?
i had hoped so , but unfortunately not .
he has a date tonight .
with vanessa &apos;s roommate , olivia burke .
didn &apos;t she tell you ?
lily .
she is a very famous actress .
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t worship at the altar
of shallow hollywood celebrities .
oh .
but apparently your school does .
mom , can you not do this right now ?
honey , these institutions are businesses first .
i mean , was this girl even qualified to enter ...
or was it purely a publicity stunt ?
well , that &apos;s my shallow hollywood roommate ...
and also one of the nicest , smartest people
i &apos;ve met at college . excuse me .
hey . how is your date ?
great .
dan &apos;s making indian chicken .
moroccan , actually .
oh . uh , look , i know i shouldn &apos;t be asking you this .
i was just wondering ,
why did dan change his mind
about me meeting his parents ?
i must have done something to scare him off .
you can tell me the truth . i promise .
no , you didn &apos;t do anything .
well , i must have .
you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna ask him .
no !
look , dan &apos;s parents are just really judgmental ,
and they &apos;re always going on
about celebrities and the dumbing down of culture .
so he &apos;s worried
his parents will think
i &apos;m some shallow hollywood pinhead ?
no ...
like dan &apos;s embarrassed to introduce me to them ?
olivia , dan just wants to protect you from them .
you know what , vanessa ?
you don &apos;t need to make excuses for him , okay ? i get it .
i gotta go .
so where do you get your hair cut ?
oh , uh , trumper &apos;s , off piccadilly .
tut , tut .
i &apos;m not that kind of girl .
do you have a boyfriend ?
not exactly .
wait .
what for ?
what the ... mr. ellis .
blair waldorf . oh , lord .
i @-@ i have to go .
don &apos;t you run away from me .
hey ! have you no sense of decency ?
well , you got your kiss .
number 27 on the tribeca scavenger hunt ...
kiss the chuck bass .
check .
i expect more from a representative of a college !
and the toast ?
oh , a deal &apos;s a deal . it &apos;s all yours .
i should call vanessa , break the bad news .
allow me .
we &apos;re rivals , but friends at heart .
until tonight .
out , you cable @-@ knit queen !
you were late .
i got caught in a text flurry with dorota . i &apos;m sorry .
i have to get uptown for a dinner .
i assume you &apos;re skipping the parents &apos; thing ?
i may pop in ...
for vanessa &apos;s toast , just for laughs .
are you upset because you kissed a guy ?
i &apos;m upset because i kissed somebody that wasn &apos;t you .
you really think i &apos;ve never kissed a guy before ?
love me ?
always .
oh , well . i tried .
guess i should , uh ,
work on keeping my opinions to myself .
you think ?
i just wanted to say , tonight i will promise
to keep an open mind about your school ,
about everything .
when you hear my toast ,
i think you &apos;ll understand why
this is the right place for me .
okay .
come here .
i hope .
so what do you think about going out to eat tonight ?
or we could just go to the parents &apos; dinner .
are you sure ? i mean , my parents are ... are gonna be there .
well , then i better be on my best behavior .
pick me up in an hour ?
okay .
as for lonely boy ,
i suspect tonight &apos;s going to be strictly a family affair ...
to remember .
i &apos;ll be right back . i just have to find someone .
don &apos;t you just adore the national arts club ?
ahh. it &apos;s so &quot; age of innocence . &quot;
are you looking for mr. ellis ?
because he asked me to give you a message .
now what was it ?
oh , you &apos;re not giving the toast ,
i am , and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
what are you talking about ?
i won , like always .
please ... don &apos;t do this .
oh , my god . are you begging ?
my mom is here ,
and you have no idea what this speech means for me .
please .
you &apos;re embarrassing yourself even more than usual .
when will you learn ?
some people are simply better than others .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m sure they &apos;re gonna love you .
uh @-@ huh . so you think they &apos;re gonna want my autograph ?
i @-@ i doubt it .
dan , what are you doing here ?
please . miss the freshmen dinner ?
dad , lily , this is olivia .
rufus humphrey .
dan has told us so much about you .
oh , that dress is beautiful .
i recognize it from the herve leger show .
oh , yeah ?
except it wasn &apos;t on the runway ,
so that &apos;s kind of impossible .
max azria &apos;s , like , one of my best friends .
he does me crazy favors .
are you feeling okay ?
totes .
so anyone famous here ?
i mean , besides me .
you there . you &apos;re one of blair &apos;s new minions , aren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re chuck bass . blair said you weren &apos;t coming .
my dinner canceled . the emir had to fly home ...
something about a revolution . where is she ?
probably getting ready for her toast .
keep up , bambi .
blair &apos;s not giving the toast .
uh , yes , she is . mr. ellis promised if ...
promised what ?
nate .
hey . what are you doing here ? serena .
i heard you talking to your grandfather .
why would you leak a fake photo ?
are you trying to destroy tripp &apos;s campaign ?
no . that &apos;s gonna win tripp the election .
what are you talking about ?
once the buckleys leak it ,
we &apos;ll release the real photo .
it &apos;s gonna look like
the buckleys planted the fake one .
people are finally gonna see them
as the villains they really are .
and what happens to carter ? you ... you just used him ?
come on , serena . he proposed to p.j. &apos; s sister
to pay off his gambling debt .
wake up . the guy &apos;s hardly innocent .
but i am sorry i had to lie to you .
no , you &apos;re not , but you will be .
manhattan , p.j. buckley .
no , i &apos;m doing the mother teresa movie .
yes. yeah , leo &apos;s playing my boyfriend .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be just a second .
well , let &apos;s just meet at your pad in the bu .
the bu ... the bu is malibu .
oh , yes .
you know what ? just give us a moment , please .
uh @-@ huh. oh ! wait . i @-@ i gotta go .
i love you , too , bitch .
what ... what are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re referring to the bu , you &apos;re calling your astrologer .
since when do you even have an astrologer ?
i guess ever since
i became another shallow hollywood celebrity
you know , the kind that
you are so afraid your parents wouldn &apos;t approve of ?
what are you talking about ?
vanessa told me that &apos;s why you disinvited me .
vanessa ? i blew this dinner off because vanessa told me
that you were freaking out about meeting my parents .
what ? i never said that .
oh , my god .
the lips , the teeth , the tip of the tongue .
the lips , the teeth , the tip ... of the tongue .
please tell me you &apos;re not coming here to grovel .
you really think you &apos;re that much better than me ?
oh , i think we both know the answer to that .
blair , i have to talk to you .
not now . just listen . i ...
quiet ! god , i &apos;ve had just about enough of you .
sophie , you &apos;re minion number one .
amalia , you &apos;re number two .
so tell me once and for all ,
what makes you better than me ?
do you really want to know ?
yeah .
everything .
generations of breeding and wealth
had to come together to produce me .
i have more in common
with marie antoinette than with you .
and granted , you may be popular
at some step @-@ ivy safety school , but the fact is ,
the rabble is still rabble , and they need a queen .
you stole the toast .
i was willing to do what was necessary ,
including lying to chuck ,
the one person who trusts me more than anyone .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to give my toast .
actually , blair ...
congratulations . you just did .
oh , no .
oh , no .
sorry , ladies .
le jeux sont fait .
thanks for playing ... each other .
i know i shouldn &apos;t have lied . it &apos;s just when mr. ellis
asked olivia to give the toast instead of me
wait . you were the other girl ?
wait a second , you were supposed to give the toast ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i wanted to surprise you
with this nice toast about being here
with your parents , and ... and then you disinvited me .
well , i did that because you lied to me .
why couldn &apos;t you just tell me you wanted to give the toast ?
i mean , i would have given it to you .
i know .
i let blair convince me if i asked , you &apos;d say no .
when i called and asked why dan didn &apos;t want me
to meet his family , you said it &apos;s because they looked down
on hollywood people like ...
and they probably do now , you know .
i mean , you were ... you were pretty annoying .
i am so sorry .
i substituted my awful family
for his amazing one . i love rufus and lily ,
and i wish they were my parents .
vanessa ?
i just want to wish you luck .
mom .
chuck ?
chuck is gone .
but i need to talk to him . i need to explain .
blair , whatever you needed him to do ,
do you really think he would have refused you ?
no .
he &apos;d never say no ... to anything .
i messed up , didn &apos;t i ?
yes . yes , you really did .
lily , you &apos;re supposed to say ,
&quot; everything is going to be fine . &quot;
where did you learn how to give a pep talk
guantanamo ?
blair , i understand a thing or two about ambitious women ,
but without trust , you &apos;re lost .
let chuck lick his wounds .
you can talk to him tomorrow .
serena .
you came .
i &apos;m sorry for all the things that i said to you at the wedding .
i deserved them . um , look , serena , i &apos;m leaving tomorrow .
no , you &apos;re not .
i settled your debt with the buckleys .
what ?
how ?
it &apos;s a long story , but ...
i helped p.j. avoid a very public fiasco .
nate probably hates me now , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
you can stay .
i didn &apos;t ask for you to save me .
i wanted to .
serena , this was my debt to settle , not yours .
if that means i have to go work on ...
work on an oil rig ?
carter , i wasn &apos;t gonna allow that to happen .
you have nothing to prove to the buckleys .
i wasn &apos;t proving it to them .
i was proving it to you , to myself .
i wanted to take responsibility for what i did .
i have to go .
no .
i saw the way you looked at me at the wedding ,
and i see the way that you &apos;re looking at me now .
i think i &apos;d rather ... have you hate me
than feel sorry for me .
please .
mom .
please .
i &apos;m so sorry .
vanessa , we are so hard on you
because we want you
to challenge yourself to be your own person .
are we really wrong to ... to question your decision
to attend college here ?
i think it &apos;s time
for you to consider who this place is turning you into .
your parents hate me . i hate me .
we &apos;ll just explain what happened . you &apos;ll be fine .
maybe she &apos;s different when they &apos;re alone .
maybe she &apos;s totally different .
oh , hey . we missed you guys .
yes , very much .
oh , god .
dan , was that blair on the p.a. ?
she really should have run that speech past someone .
uh , yeah , you know , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll get to that ,
but , uh , before , when olivia was ,
i don &apos;t know , i guess she was being all hollywood ...
oh , what ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , my god . i have to explain .
i &apos;m so sorry .
ladies and gentlemen ,
it &apos;s time for this year &apos;s freshman toast ,
and it &apos;s my honor to call upon olivia burke .
what ?
i was not expecting this .
olivia , can i get a picture ?
me , too .
oh , sure . um ...
nice try , ladies .
you came out swinging but never stood a chance
against a hollywood heavyweight .
why did we do all this ?
you tell me .
hi . i &apos;m olivia burke .
okay , dan , the humiliation has got to end ,
it &apos;ll be fine this time . i promise . i hope .
you made it .
hey . there you are .
hi . i &apos;m jenny .
it &apos;s nice to meet you . i &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
so , uh , do you really know leo ?
um , it was just a joke to lighten the mood .
mr. and mrs. humphrey , i &apos;m really sorry about yesterday .
dan , already explained everything . let &apos;s talk toppings .
we have whipped cream , strawberries , chocolate chips .
and , uh , does anyone want coffee ?
jenny , wait . um ...
my &quot; welcome back , kotter &quot; mugs .
yes , well , it wouldn &apos;t be our home without them .
olivia , you get the , uh , vinnie barbarino .
you know , travolta has , uh , a set of these .
he got really upset when i accidentally cracked
his freddie &quot; boom @-@ boom &quot; washington .
i &apos;m just kidding .
hey , let &apos;s eat .
oh , you weren &apos;t kidding , were you ?
no .
what do you want , blair ?
forgiveness .
i &apos;m so sorry , chuck .
i made a mistake .
i know there &apos;s no excuse , but ... it was just a kiss .
the people you manipulate ...
i know how little respect you have for them .
but not you . i don &apos;t feel that way about you .
and i won &apos;t ever do it again . i promise .
it was a mistake .
i &apos;m in a meeting .
call you later ?
hey , mom . i &apos;m at the place . i ordered you a croissant .
oh , honey , thank you , but i &apos;m already on the road .
yeah , it &apos;s such a long drive , and i wanted to get an early
no , i get it .
and you know i can &apos;t leave your dad alone too long .
yeah , t @-@ tell dad i said hi .
i will . love you .
me , too .
when it comes to family , we &apos;re all still children at heart .
hey .
no matter how old we get ,
we always need a place to call home .
because without the people you love most ...
you can &apos;t help but feel all alone in the world .
you want it ?
thanks .
fortunately , misery loves company ...
well , for now at least .
