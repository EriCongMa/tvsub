you want to come with me to storybrooke ?
all i care about is a future where we might be a family .
your were sisters once .
just promise me you &apos;ll hold on to each other .
i think you have another love to find .
hades .
go to him .
you told her what ?
to give him a chance .
and you thought that was a good idea because ?
because we &apos;re family .
and i &apos;m trying to trust zelena .
she thinks she can change hades .
i &apos;m sorry , luv ,
i missed the part where zelena changed .
you &apos;d think the ex @-@ pirate with a rum habit
would cut my sister some slack .
well , you &apos;d think that the evil queen
would be smarter than to send the wicked witch
to romance the most devious man alive .
easy , guys . we &apos;re not gonna win the war against hades
if we use all our ammo on each other .
the savior has a point .
what the hell are you doing here ?
get behind me , kid .
oh , i didn &apos;t find you to hurt you .
i came for your ...
wow , this is hard .
... help .
what could you possibly want our help with ?
simple .
i went to meet zelena for our date
and found this .
no .
zelena , she &apos;s been kidnapped by gold and pan .
they &apos;re asking for a meeting tomorrow morning .
gold wants you to tear up the contract for his unborn child .
so , do it .
i just got my sister back .
i &apos;m not going to lose her now .
neither will i.
i &apos;ll give them what they want ,
but i know the stiltskins and their tricks .
they &apos;re not gonna keep their word .
not unless i have an ace up my sleeve .
luckily for you , you got one .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ve been zelena &apos;s doting sister
for all of what , three hours ? no .
who &apos;s going to be more motivated than me ?
emma .
what ? why ?
if zelena gets out of this alive ,
i &apos;m prepared to offer you a deal .
don &apos;t trust a word he says , emma .
now i agree with the pirate .
you and i both know
your family wouldn &apos;t be here if it weren &apos;t for you .
if you help me save her ,
i &apos;ll take everyone &apos;s names off their headstones .
so we can leave the underworld .
so , what do you say , savior ?
do you want to send your family home or not ?
so , i just thought i &apos;d ask on the off chance
if there &apos;s someone still working here
who remembers that baby being brought in .
26 years ago ?
we can &apos;t keep a cook for six weeks .
maybe , like , a long @-@ time customer .
the food ain &apos;t good enough for that kind of loyalty .
sorry , honey , but you &apos;re not gonna find anyone here
who remembers this .
tough break , kid .
what ?
heard what you were asking .
you a reporter or something ?
no , nothing like that .
you &apos;re the baby , aren &apos;t you ?
from the article -- you &apos;re the baby , right ?
intuition . mine &apos;s usually pretty good .
and i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s hard not being able to find your family .
it &apos;s just a dead end .
i &apos;ve had a lot of those .
so , thanks for your concern , &apos; but i got this .
can i say one more thing based on my intuition ?
okay .
i look at you -- young , pretty ...
okay .
... and i see someone who now --
stop me if i &apos;m wrong , but ...
someone who stole money from a couple convenience stores in phoenix ,
got arrested , and took off on her bail .
well , hello there .
show yourself .
glad to see you followed instructions and came alone .
zelena .
i tried to stop them , but ...
it &apos;s not your fault , it &apos;s theirs .
oh , is that so ?
because we wouldn &apos;t be here
if you &apos;d ripped up that contract when i asked you to .
you didn &apos;t have leverage .
and now i do .
so , you stand there and don &apos;t move
except to rip up that contract .
then you get the witch .
there .
now give her back .
oh , you can have her back .
but we didn &apos;t say anything about her heart , did we ?
you see , my body is ready to walk the earth again .
except for one thing .
a living heart .
so , if you don &apos;t mind .
my heart has got a protection spell on it .
you may be good at magic , but we &apos;re better .
you sure about that ?
i was beginning to think you couldn &apos;t get in .
locks don &apos;t bother me much .
he ripped up the contract like you wanted , so leave .
since when does the savior answer to the king of death ?
since he &apos;s the one getting my family home .
you picked the wrong team to back , ms. swan .
you won &apos;t get what you want from him .
really ? because you just did ,
which is making me wonder why you &apos;re still here .
yeah , i suppose you have a point .
rumple .
looks like your little boy only came for what he wanted .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna be that lucky .
zelena .
are you all right ?
you tore up that contract for me .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d do it .
when will you believe i &apos;d do anything for you ?
i think i &apos;m getting there .
is that ?
my heart . it &apos;s beating .
what the hell was that ?
my banishment .
it &apos;s over .
i can finally leave this place for good .
very soon , at the cemetery ,
there will be a fully formed portal back to storybrooke ,
but it will close at sunset .
first things first .
i held up my end of the deal .
now it &apos;s your turn .
we &apos;re going home through that portal , too .
all of us .
how &apos;d it get here ?
the hands are moving .
is that a good sign or a bad one ?
it &apos;s a great one if you want to leave .
when those hands spin fast enough in about an hour ,
it &apos;ll turn into an open portal back .
which we can &apos;t go through because of those .
so , let &apos;s get on with it .
gladly .
there . as promised .
you &apos;re no longer tied to this realm .
i told you love could change him .
i don &apos;t buy it .
a man can &apos;t change that quickly .
we &apos;re free to go through the portal when it opens ,
which means it &apos;s time to split my heart
so you can leave with us .
aye , luv .
do it .
emma .
mom !
why didn &apos;t it work ?
i told you we couldn &apos;t trust him .
that wasn &apos;t me .
i &apos;m afraid there are laws of nature beyond even my control .
no , it should work . i died .
my wife &apos;s heart brought me back .
how long were you dead ?
a minute or so , maybe less .
i didn &apos;t think i recalled you entering this realm .
your soul never left your body .
that &apos;s why it worked for you .
so hook &apos;s been down here too long ?
and his body &apos;s rotting away up there .
even if your soul could return to it ,
i doubt either of you could stomach the smell .
well , emma , it appears you have to return without me .
there has to be another way .
emma , please .
you &apos;re telling me no one &apos;s gone to the underworld
and brought someone back ?
they have .
who ?
who did ? how ?
it was a long time ago , and it was a rumor .
there &apos;s no proof it actually worked .
tell me everything .
sorry about this ,
but i &apos;m gonna go take a shower now .
you gonna shower in that jajaet ?
you probably sleep in that thing , too , huh ?
funny .
sit tight , watch some cartoons .
i &apos;ll be right back .
sorry , tasha .
but i think your mom will survive .
do you guys all get this special search thing ?
oh , i dated a guy once who &apos;s good at picking locks .
you could &apos;ve left .
the hancock county courthouse has a file on me .
i didn &apos;t know that .
they could know something .
they could know the name of the boy who brought me in .
there -- there could &apos;ve been a note with me
that was dropped into the file , something , anything .
you could take me there .
why would i do that ?
because i can get out of handcuffs ,
and you &apos;ll have to track me down in every city and every hotel
all the way across the country .
look , if you help me with this ,
i &apos;ll go quietly all the way to phoenix .
i just want some answers .
you want to know where you come from .
courthouse opens at 9 : 00 tomorrow .
orpheus and eurydice .
i know this myth .
she died , and he followed her to the underworld to get her back .
these are the only two souls who ever escaped my realm .
how ?
i thought you said that broke the laws of nature .
orpheus helped eurydice escape by feeding her ambrosia ,
the food of the gods .
and where exactly do you get some of that ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t recall seeing it on the menu
at the blind witch &apos;s .
an elevator ?
i &apos;m the savior . i &apos;ve got magic .
and i &apos;m the lord of the underworld .
that should tell you something .
the ambrosia , it &apos;s powerful ,
and like a petty spoiled child ,
it wants all the power for itself .
everything else is shut down below .
there &apos;s no hopping in and out in a puff of smoke .
this is the only way ,
and once you &apos;re down there , you &apos;re on your own .
and then what ? we &apos;re knee deep in a field of ambrosia ?
can &apos;t be that easy .
i &apos;m not really sure .
even i &apos;ve never ventured that far down .
so we &apos;re going to the one place in hell
where even the devil is afraid to go .
not hell and not the devil .
and not because i &apos;m afraid .
there &apos;s a test to ensure that only those
who are worthy of eating ambrosia can reach it ,
and it will require offering up your heart for judgment .
without magic , how am i gonna take out my own --
you &apos;re not .
my gift to you .
take good care of it .
let &apos;s have this be the last time we do this today , okay ?
just trying to help .
so , failing this test
has , what , fatal consequences ?
one would think .
you don &apos;t have to do this , swan .
and you didn &apos;t have to sacrifice your life
to save all of us from the dark ones .
we &apos;re going .
we &apos;ll be right here waiting for you .
regina--
i know the drill .
if you &apos;re not back by sunset --
everybody leaves , promise me .
you &apos;ll be back .
i love you , mom .
i love you , too , kid .
she may not accept you for who you are , but i will .
despite your rude abandonment of me earlier .
touching , papa .
yes , abandonment hurts , doesn &apos;t it ?
but with the contract gone ,
i only care about one thing --
getting belle home so her father can wake her .
i &apos;d love to help you make the journey .
but that &apos;s going to be quite difficult
since i didn &apos;t get the heart you promised me .
oh , there &apos;s the man i remember .
always thinking about what &apos;s in it for himself .
there &apos;s something in it for you , too .
pandora &apos;s box .
you can keep her safe in here in exchange for a heart .
otherwise , you both might lose out and miss that portal home .
opening soon , but only till sunset .
so , do we have a deal ?
tick , tock .
we can &apos;t just sit around waiting for them to get back .
we don &apos;t have a choice , henry .
the minute emma and hook get off this elevator ,
we &apos;re going straight through that portal .
what about operation firebird ?
we can &apos;t leave the underworld
without helping the people trapped here .
they were trapped here because of hades .
who , fortunately for them ,
will no longer be a resident .
she &apos;s right .
the underworld will function as it was meant to --
a place for people to deal with their unfinished business
without anyone getting in their way .
yeah .
but a lot of the people down here
don &apos;t even know what their unfinished business is .
but maybe as the author , i can tell them .
what &apos;s going on ?
great . you got our message .
what are they doing here ?
hello to you , too .
are you just gonna stand there ,
or are you gonna let our darling daughter see her mommy ?
regina .
it &apos;s okay , robin .
as hard as this is to believe ,
they &apos;re actually helping us .
we both want the same thing --
to leave this place .
it &apos;s true . he took our names off the tombstones .
we can leave .
well , then what are we still doing here ?
boy scout &apos;s got a point .
we could take the baby to the cemetery now
and then all walk through as soon as it opens .
not without emma and hook .
and henry &apos;s right .
we can still help people .
robin , take the baby to the portal .
no . i &apos;m not leaving you in this place .
he may be playing nice ,
but there &apos;s still plenty of people down here
that have a grudge against you .
okay , then give the baby to zelena .
are you mad ?
we can trust her .
maybe you can .
trust me .
i wouldn &apos;t be doing this
if i didn &apos;t think it &apos;s what &apos;s best for your daughter .
thank you .
are you okay ?
i just -- i need a moment .
who &apos;s there ?
it &apos;s just me , dearie .
don &apos;t worry .
you &apos;ll remember none of this .
bloody hell . you all right , luv ?
looks like this is our stop .
how long could this take ?
you take a file out of the drawer , you hand it over .
how hard is that ?
maybe i can motivate them to speed up .
armor .
what ?
my jacket , the one you like to ridicule .
it &apos;s my armor .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re not thinking clearly . you &apos;re emotional .
it &apos;s what keeps getting you in trouble .
can i give you a piece of advice ?
you got to learn how to protect yourself .
look , whatever we find here ,
that ain &apos;t gonna be the end all be all .
find your armor .
miss , i have your file .
it &apos;s too thin .
it &apos;s the same damn article .
there &apos;s something on the boy who brought you in .
looks like he ran away and fell out of the system .
the inventory of what i came in with .
i &apos;m sorry .
something &apos;s missing . can you just take another look ?
that &apos;s all there is .
just look again .
miss ...
okay , you know what ? i can look .
step back or i &apos;ll have to call security .
i can just look through the file !
emma , it &apos;s a dead end .
you saw that folder .
things could fall out of the folder and other things .
come on , you &apos;re grasping at straws .
straws are all i have ! that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s -- straws are it .
calm down . you said you would go quietly if we did this .
we gave a day , we did it , now let &apos;s go , come on .
i &apos;m not giving up .
maybe you should .
but don &apos;t do it because we had a deal .
do it for yourself .
go back to phoenix and start again ,
looking front ways this time .
once you &apos;ve paid the price for everything you &apos;ve done ,
you can start building a new life .
you just want to drag my ass back to arizona
so you can get the money for bringing me in .
i didn &apos;t have to give up a whole damn day
to do this for you , did i ?
i kept my word , now you &apos;re gonna keep yours .
hate me all you want , but tomorrow ,
we are going back to phoenix . do you understand ?
i understand .
come on , kid . it &apos;s arizona .
it &apos;s not hell .
here you go , stealthy , your unfinished business .
i hadn &apos;t realized how much resentment
i held against bashful .
thank you .
and , um , when you get back ,
can you tell my brothers i miss them ?
i will .
y @-@ you know , leroy -- grumpy --
he talks about you a lot .
any sign of mom and hook ?
no , but we still have some time
before the portal even opens .
don &apos;t count on it !
that &apos;s right , vermin .
scatter !
sorry , cruella ,
but i don &apos;t think your unfinished business
is going to take you to any place you &apos;d like .
oh , i &apos;m not here to collect my story .
i want to stay in this marvelous realm .
you see , with hades departing ,
the underworld is going to need a new ruler .
you ?
it &apos;s the only upside
to your daughter sentencing me to this fate .
but the job would be meaningless
without a citizenry to torment .
cruella , we &apos;re not gonna let you harm these people .
oh , you think i &apos;m just going to keep them here ?
oh , no .
i &apos;m going to keep all of you here .
it &apos;s only fair ,
considering it was your son
who refused to write me back to life ,
and you , you dissolved my james ,
the best toy in the whole playpen .
i &apos;m still waiting to hear
how you &apos;re going to stop us from leaving , fuzzy .
because all your magic can do
is make a dog roll over and beg .
true . i don &apos;t have the magic
to keep you all penned in here .
but i do .
out of the way , david .
you forced my hand , kid eater !
regina !
what the hell ?
that &apos;s right .
no one &apos;s getting out before sunset
when the portal closes ,
and then no one &apos;s getting out .
consider it payback , regina !
for tricking those children into burning me in my own oven .
oh , it &apos;s going to be a nice eternity after all .
at least for us .
the instructions couldn &apos;t be in english ?
&quot; only a heart filled with true love can pass . &quot;
seriously ?
you &apos;d be surprised what they teach you in the royal navy .
the only question is ,
what the bloody hell does it mean ?
i think i know .
i think i have to weigh my heart
to see if my love for you is true .
what ?
are you saying that what we share is ...
well , we &apos;re about to find out .
i know you love me .
but true love is the rarest magic of all .
are you certain ?
i mean , honestly , i &apos;m not sure ,
but who could be ?
we have to try .
why can you only admit how you feel
when one of us is facing certain death ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess my armor &apos;s been on for such a long time
that i ...
sometimes i forget i don &apos;t need it with you .
here goes .
it didn &apos;t bloody work .
emma , what &apos;s wrong ?
the pedestal .
get my heart off .
killian .
killian !
get your heart !
what the hell is that ?
that &apos;s true love .
emma , you chose me .
that was the test .
oh , god !
geez .
cleo , you scared the hell out of me .
what are you doing ?
i know we had a deal , but i can &apos;t --
yes , you can , and you will .
you want your bail money that bad ?
did you call security ?
do you think a security guard is gonna show up
and ask to see my license and give me my money ?
damn it .
all they &apos;re gonna see is two moron criminals
on government property asking to get shot .
then why are you here ?
look , i &apos;m sure that your parents
had reasons they gave you up , okay ?
but you finding out ,
what good is that gonna do you ?
they would want you to focus on what you &apos;ve got now .
how do you know what my parents would want ?
because i know things ,
and sometimes you would do yourself some good listening to me .
emma , look what i &apos;m risking being here .
come on , let &apos;s go .
this is the police !
okay , come on .
come out with your hands over your head !
stand back .
i &apos;ll get your back .
no .
the ambrosia are dead .
and have been for some time .
someone cut it .
not somebody . hades .
i knew we couldn &apos;t trust him .
of course we couldn &apos;t .
hades probably did this ages ago
when orpheus and eurydice used them to escape .
then why lie to us ?
why send us after dead fruit ?
because he doesn &apos;t want us coming with him to storybrooke .
i don &apos;t get it .
the blind witch &apos;s spells are always half @-@ baked .
unless this isn &apos;t her spell .
hades .
he wants us trapped in here .
it &apos;s open now ,
but it won &apos;t stay open much longer --
15 minutes tops .
they should &apos;ve been here by now .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s keeping them ,
but we can &apos;t wait .
zelena , we don &apos;t have time .
i can &apos;t leave my sister here .
we &apos;ve done everything we can for your friends .
they &apos;re heroes . they &apos;ll get here in time .
do you really think so ?
without me in their way ,
what could possibly stop them ?
all right , then .
let &apos;s go .
where have you been ?
we &apos;re running out of time .
still can &apos;t bring yourself to trust little rumple ,
can you , papa ?
you always were a touchy boy .
i take it that means
it &apos;s not going to be open much longer .
shall we ? not quite yet .
timing is everything .
have patience , papa .
there must be seeds or clippings
or something we could use to help save you .
hades tricked us into coming down here .
there &apos;s no telling what he &apos;s done to your family ,
or what he &apos;ll do if he reaches storybrooke .
we need to get out of here .
not without the ambrosia . it &apos;s the only way we can --
we &apos;ll find another way up , i promise .
but we have to go .
blood . i didn &apos;t hear a shot .
it &apos;s not a shot .
glass from the window .
i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t --
an ambulance .
you &apos;re gonna be okay . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
it &apos;s not an ambulance .
that &apos;s the cops . don &apos;t get caught here .
they &apos;ll be able to help you .
and i &apos;ll call your family .
i have no family .
your little girl .
i saw the picture .
she has no idea who i am .
what ?
i took that 10 years ago from across the street .
you gave her up .
just like i was .
you &apos;re holding on too tight .
emma , let go .
let go .
over here ! we got blood !
and they went this way !
come on , we don &apos;t have that much time before the portal closes .
what ?
i &apos;m not going up with you .
i never was .
we &apos;re never gonna find anything up there to save me .
but you said --
it was the only way i could get you to leave that chamber .
no .
killian , i came to the underworld to save you .
i &apos;m not going back without you .
i &apos;m afraid we don &apos;t have that choice , luv .
look .
i just want to say my goodbyes down here
without everyone watching .
no .
we &apos;ve already had more time than we were ever meant to .
that &apos;s not true .
we both know it is .
you should have let me go in camelot .
don &apos;t make that mistake again .
i just ...
i don &apos;t know how to say goodbye .
well , then don &apos;t .
just promise me one thing .
if i helped take off that armor ,
don &apos;t ... put it back on
just because you &apos;re gonna lose me .
i promise .
but then you have to promise me something , too .
don &apos;t let me be your unfinished business .
move on from here .
don &apos;t wait for me to show up .
aye , luv .
i think i can manage that .
i love you .
i love you , too .
yes , sir , i &apos;m on the trail .
you &apos;ll have your skip by tonight ,
and then the next one --
yeah , no , i know .
i know it &apos;s a trial period ,
but you &apos;ll see i &apos;ve got this .
i can do it .
okay .
oh , i got to go . bye .
hi . can i help you ?
maybe .
where did you get this ?
so , it &apos;s you ?
tasha morris .
i &apos;ve never seen this picture before ,
but yeah , that looks like me .
am i in some kind of trouble ?
here &apos;s the thing .
i ... knew your birth mother ,
cleo fox .
oh , my god .
i collected everything i could find about her .
i have access to some records from work .
i just thought ...
you might want to know where you came from .
is -- is she looking for me ?
she &apos;s ...
i &apos;m sorry .
thanks .
thank you so much .
could you ring this up for me ?
yeah , of course .
i got to get to work .
mom .
henry .
emma , where &apos;s hook ?
i &apos;ll explain later .
we have to hurry to get to the thing .
we can &apos;t .
the blind witch cast a spell trapping us here .
let me guess , she got it from hades .
this whole thing has been a setup
to keep us trapped in the underworld .
you mean , the ambrosia -- - it wasn &apos;t there .
so , hook ...
he -- he can &apos;t leave ?
he can move on .
but he wanted to make sure that we all got out
even if he couldn &apos;t .
well , then , let &apos;s give him his wish .
yeah .
you did it .
come on , it &apos;s getting late .
let &apos;s get out of here .
people will find them .
it &apos;s nearly time .
we should go .
we don &apos;t want to miss our ticket home .
now ...
are you ready ?
yes .
thank you , son .
pleasure &apos;s all mine , papa .
wait , something --
wait , something &apos;s wrong .
does it feel different than you remembered ?
what &apos;s happening ?
what did you do ?
that wasn &apos;t really robin hood &apos;s heart
i put inside you .
i knew you or your shadow could be watching .
whilst you were otherwise distracted ,
i returned robin &apos;s heart to him .
what did you put in me ?
a wineskin i glamoured ,
filled with water ...
from the river of souls .
no .
why ?
villains don &apos;t get happy endings , papa .
and i &apos;m here to make sure you never get yours .
goodbye , papa .
for good this time .
the portal , it &apos;s closing ! hurry ! hurry !
go !
emma .
i &apos;m sorry there wasn &apos;t some other way .
when i bought this jacket ,
it was meant to be armor
to protect me from getting hurt by those i love .
but now it &apos;s just a reminder
that i have to protect those i love .
nothing &apos;s more important .
you did your best for hook .
i don &apos;t know .
did i ?
all i know is , i can &apos;t lose anyone else .
let &apos;s go .
