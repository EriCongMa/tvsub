第三季 第二十集
i saw the man in your freezer .
mrs. mccluskey and parker shared a secret ... &lt; / i &gt;
you can never tell anyone .
... but the secret was discovered . &lt; / i &gt;
you bet me in a game of poker ?
susan was forced to make a decision . &lt; / i &gt;
get out .
there will be no kissing and no wedding .
lynette ventured into dangerous territory . &lt; / i &gt;
you ever wear your hair down ?
sometimes .
it looks really good .
thanks .
you embarrassed to be dating me ?
if gaby finds out she &apos;s going to hit the ceiling .
edie came to a disturbing realization ... &lt; / i &gt;
oh , my god . you &apos;re still in love with her .
... and gabby took a bold step . &lt; / i &gt;
in a few months , i will be mrs. victor lang .
i don &apos;t know my own strength .
the night of her engagement party , &lt; / i &gt;
gabrielle solis was injured . &lt; / i &gt;
but she wasn &apos;t hurt by the chauffeur &lt; / i &gt;
who almost slammed a door on her fingers , &lt; / i &gt;
or the stranger who almost stepped on her hand , &lt; / i &gt;
or the waiter who almost dropped a knife on her wrist . &lt; / i &gt;
no , gabrielle &apos;s injury came about &lt; / i &gt;
in a more unexpected fashion . &lt; / i &gt;
and was caused by someone gabrielle thought , &lt; / i &gt;
was her friend . &lt; / i &gt;
thank you . so have you told bree about your engagement ?
yep . she &apos;s on the top of a swiss alp ,
and still managed to send a basket of muffins .
you &apos;re kidding .
those damn thing traveled five thousand miles
and they were still moist .
i don &apos;t know how she does it .
it &apos;s getting late . let &apos;s break out the champagne .
wait wait . you &apos;re not gonna embarrass me
with some sappy toast , are you ?
i &apos;m not . but susan &apos;s written a poem .
a poem ?
she &apos;s reworked the lyrics to wind beneath my wings . &lt; / i &gt;
testing . one , two , three . testing .
what are you waiting for ? get the champagne .
hey , gabby .
hi , edie .
so , i finally met victor . he is so charming .
isn &apos;t he great ? i know it &apos;s been quick ,
but he &apos;s just so amazing .
so you really love him ?
he is the one ?
he is .
and i &apos;ve never been happier .
i am so thrilled for you .
edie , are you ok ?
yes .
yes , yes . i &apos;m fine .
oh , sweetie .
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re gonna find someone soon .
i just know it .
what ?
actually , i have found someone .
and i am crazy about him .
well , who is it ?
oh , no . no , no . tonight is about you .
oh , no , no , edie ! come on .
it would make me happy to know who &apos;s making you happy .
really ?
yeah .
i wanna know who &apos;s putting that dopey grin on your face .
well , actually , it &apos;s carlos .
who ?
carlos . i &apos;ve been seeing carlos .
and this is how gabrielle solis came to be injured &lt; / i &gt;
the night of her engagement party . &lt; / i &gt;
and though she seemed to laugh it off , &lt; / i &gt;
gabrielle had been cut much , much deeper &lt; / i &gt;
than anyone could see . &lt; / i &gt;
greg is definitely off the wagon .
gossip . &lt; / i &gt;
for most housewives , &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;s just a harmless form of recreation . &lt; / i &gt;
an exchange of semi @-@ interesting tidbits
concerning the semi @-@ interesting lives &lt; / i &gt;
of people they know . &lt; / i &gt;
that mailman was in sarah &apos;s house over an hour .
packages weren &apos;t all he &apos;s delivering .
i could smell the whiskey on amy &apos;s breath .
it wasn &apos;t even noon yet .
joanne may say she was on a religious retreat ,
but since when does praying make your boobs bigger ?
but the time comes in every neighborhood &lt; / i &gt;
when something very interesting happens . &lt; / i &gt;
and that &apos;s when gossip stops being recreation , &lt; / i &gt;
and becomes obsession . &lt; / i &gt;
what kind of woman would keep her husband &apos;s body
in the freezer ?
for ten years ? it &apos;s crazy .
has anybody talked to her ?
i &apos;ve knocked twice . she &apos;s not answering .
i saw the curtain move . i think i saw a hand .
great , now . we know she &apos;s watching us .
why should we be embarassed ?
we &apos;re not the one who &apos;s kept a corpsicle in the basement .
that &apos;s right . she babysat your kids .
oh , please . i don &apos;t want to think of how many times
she brought them ice cream from that basement .
i mean , if you want to keep your husband on ice ,
at least have a dedicated freezer .
do you think she actually killed him ?
oh , yeah . why else would she have hid the body ?
well , so far she &apos;s only been charged with
improper disposal of a corpse .
once they defrost the body and do an autopsy ,
i guarantee you they &apos;re gonna find a bellyful of arsenic .
what &apos;s arsenic ?
it &apos;s just something yucky , honey .
go on and play with your ball . go on .
i &apos;m trying so hard to protect them from this .
there are just some things kids don &apos;t need to know about .
there are some things we don &apos;t need to know about .
would you guys excuse me ?
hey , edie .
oh , hi , gabby . what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve been doing some thinking , and you know how ...
how do i put this ?
you know how you feel like sometimes people hate you ?
i don &apos;t feel like that .
well , you should , because they do .
since when ?
since you started doing things to piss people off .
about what ?
i don &apos;t know . off the top of my head .
dating your friends &apos; exes .
so that big smile on your face the other night
was all an act .
you &apos;re not fine with me seeing carlos .
edie , there are 1,000 single men in fairview .
why do you have to date my ex @-@ husband ?
you &apos;re engaged to somebody else . what do you care ?
it &apos;s awkward .
it &apos;s like if i donated a dress to charity ,
and i went to a party and you showed up wearing it .
again , if you gave it away at first place ,
then what the hell are you bitching about ?
look , edie , just find your own men
and stop snapping up other people &apos;s castoffs !
and what if i don &apos;t ?
then be prepared to suffer the consequences .
oh , please .
you are as tall as my legs . what &apos;re you gonna do ?
you &apos;re about to find out .
who is it this time ?
it &apos;s ian .
you gonna talk to him ?
no .
he &apos;s got flowers .
i don &apos;t care !
looks like it &apos;s two dozen roses .
good . i hope the thorns rip him to shreds .
ok , mom , i know what mike and ian did was wrong ...
they bet me in a game of poker !
they made decisions about my life
over a hand of five card stud !
&quot; wrong &quot; does not even begin to cover it .
ok , ok . but there are only two guys in this world
who know all of your flaws and still find a way to love you .
you &apos;re gonna toss them both away ?
yes . i don &apos;t need a man .
i don &apos;t even need sex .
i went without it the first 16 years ...
... 22 years of my life . and i can go a few more .
this should be interesting .
what ?
mike just walked up .
give it up .
she didn &apos;t answer the first ten times .
she &apos;s not gonna answer it now .
this is getting sad .
take it like a brit . stiff upper lip .
you know what ? i &apos;ve just about bloody had it with you !
i preferred you when you were comatose and
pooping in a bag !
lucky for you i don &apos;t have that bag right now .
all right , that does it .
uh , excuse me ! guys ...
hi . my mom would really like for both of you to leave .
don &apos;t soft @-@ pedal it . let them know i mean business .
because , if you don &apos;t ,
she &apos;ll be very , very disappointed .
rip them !
so just go home and think about what you &apos;ve done .
you want something bitchier , do it yourself !
here we are .
ravioli stuffed with duck confit in a porcini cream sauce .
what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s a shame you didn &apos;t make any for yourself .
hi , honey .
hey .
just wanted to say i love you .
aren &apos;t you sweet ?
what &apos;s that noise in the background ? are the boys still up ?
yeah , they don &apos;t want to go to bed .
of course they don &apos;t . they &apos;re kids , you &apos;re the dad .
make them .
i tried , honey , but they wanna wait up for you .
they miss their mom .
is this your way of guilting me into coming back home ?
lynette , the restaurant did close a half hour ago .
preston ! don &apos;t throw pudding !
tom , i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t come home .
we &apos;re doing inventory . so it could be a while .
well , ok . try to hurry .
i will . i love you . bye .
inventory ?
i know . i &apos;m a horrible person .
i just chose ravioli over motherhood .
i should go home .
lynette , you have nothing to feel guilty about .
you bust your ass in this restaurant every day ,
you keep it going .
if anybody deserves downtime , it &apos;s you .
those are shameless rationalizations .
keep them coming .
those , too .
there you are . what are you doing outside ?
some big kids threw eggs at mrs. mccluskey &apos;s house .
oh , jeez , they shouldn &apos;t have done that .
we should go talk to her .
no , it &apos;s late .
she probably doesn &apos;t want us to bother her .
come on , bud , bedtime .
so here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
we &apos;re not talking to edie anymore .
what do you mean , &quot; we ? &quot;
i mean &quot; we &quot; as in , she betrayed me ,
and you &apos;re by best friends ,
so you gonna support me because that &apos;s what friends do .
and &quot; support , &quot; to you ,
means acting like we &apos;re in junior high ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re not furious at this .
before she sank her fangs into carlos ,
she was dating your ex @-@ husband and mike !
yes . and do you know who i blame ?
i blame karl and mike .
why isn &apos;t anybody mad at them ? i mean , let &apos;s face it .
the men , they get away with murder . they &apos;re scum !
ok . back to edie .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m comfortable ganging up on her .
really ? because i wasn &apos;t very comfortable taking your side
when you were feuding with patty monroe
over the fence line . but i did .
oh , gaby , that &apos;s not fair .
nobody really liked patty to begin with .
don &apos;t get me started about what i &apos;ve done for you .
i &apos;m still boycotting madame kim &apos;s day spa
because of your botched bikini wax .
oh , my god . how do you botch a bikini wax ?
she will show you later !
the point is , good friends share more than
just gossip and brunch .
they share enemies , too .
so are you with me or not ?
of course we &apos;re with you .
we will give edie the cold shoulder .
no , no . not cold . frozen .
i want icicles hanging from that bitch &apos;s ears !
hello ?
do you still want me to look at that book report ?
daddy helped me yesterday . you weren &apos;t home .
oh ... ok .
daddy does everything lately .
how come you always come home so late ?
well , i &apos;m really busy at the restaurant .
believe me , i come home to daddy just as soon as i can .
you &apos;re lying .
what ?
you always laugh like that when you &apos;re telling a lie .
why would you say that ?
because it &apos;s true .
i stay late because there &apos;s a lot of work to do .
right now , i &apos;m the only person who can do it .
and now , i have to go to the grocery store
because i &apos;m the only person who can do that .
so why don &apos;t you go upstairs and finish your homework ?
ok .
but it is what you do .
excuse me !
hey ! excuse me .
that &apos;s my space .
i &apos;m parked in it , so that kinda makes it my space .
hey , i waited for that spot
while the guy made phone calls and flossed his teeth .
you can &apos;t just steal it .
it &apos;s a parking space .
keep a lid on your hormones , honey .
god ! you did that on purpose !
yeah ! i &apos;m about to do this on purpose , too !
you crazy bitch ! what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m taking my damn space !
you get out of my car !
say you &apos;re sorry !
let me go !
say it !
ok , ok , i &apos;m sorry !
say &quot; i &apos;m a rude , arrogant bastard &quot;
&quot; who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect ! &quot;
i &apos;m a rude , arrogant ... how did the rest of it go ?
freeze !
was this man trying to steal your car ?
it &apos;s my car !
she tripped me and grabbed my keys .
is this true , ma &apos;am ?
all right . take his side .
hey , who you spying on ?
lynette .
she hasn &apos;t returned my last two phone calls .
i think something &apos;s up .
she &apos;s probably just busy .
yeah . we &apos;ll see about that .
i &apos;m calling her right now .
oh , my god .
what ?
she just screened me . i have been screened !
maybe she &apos;s in a hurry .
no , no . this has gabrielle solis written all over it .
she is turning people against me .
and you &apos;re surprised ?
i told you how she &apos;d react if she found out about us .
yeah ? well , if she wants to play these schoolgirl games , fine .
because i invented them .
lynette ! hi !
hey , hey .
i just tried calling you .
oh , really ?
my ringer must have been off .
no prob .
i wanted to invite you and the boys to
travers &apos; birthday party saturday .
yeah , i &apos;m having this reptile guy .
he &apos;s got all these cool snakes and lizards .
oh , the boys would love that ,
but , unfortunately , i gotta work .
well , that &apos;s a shame because i was hoping you could cater .
cater ?
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna need pastas and salads for the parents .
and at least 20 pizzas for the kids .
wow , that many ?
yeah . well , you know kids .
if one has a pizza party , they &apos;re all gonna want a pizza party .
could be good for business .
well , yeah , i guess i could work something out .
i knew i could count on you . love you .
look , whatever that court report says ,
i do not have &quot; anger issues . &quot;
i was just having a bad day .
you threatened to decapitate a man over a parking space .
a very bad day .
susan , when someone loses it like you did ,
there &apos;s usually a reason .
are things going ok at work ?
work is great .
you could just sign that paper and tell the judge i &apos;m fine .
what about your family ?
family &apos;s terrific .
seriously , you &apos;re just wasting your time here .
how &apos;s your love life ?
cancel my lunch . i &apos;m gonna be here for a while .
will you stop ringing that damn ...
i &apos;m sorry , parker .
i thought you were one of those pissants
that keep ringing the bell and running away .
so what &apos;s on your mind ?
i want you to come back and babysit us .
the new sitter stinks .
your folks hired a new sitter ?
yeah .
and she thinks carrot sticks are snacks .
well , that &apos;s rough . but life &apos;s like that sometimes .
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
if you told people what happened with your husband ,
everything could go back the way it was .
parker , see those women over there ?
nothing i could say would stop those tongues from wagging .
i &apos;m sorry , kid , but i just have to wait this one out .
can you imagine ?
i mean , finding out that two men you trusted
bet you in a poker game .
how demeaning is that ?
it depends on how you look at it .
men have been waging contests over women for centuries .
i grant you , poker isn &apos;t as romantic as , say , jousting ,
but it shows how they felt about you .
the real question is how did you feel about them ?
i told you . hurt and betrayed ...
no .
how did you feel about them before this poker business ?
well , i was engaged to ian .
so , obviously , i loved him .
and mike ? were you in love with him , too ?
how we doing on time ?
susan .
ok , fine . i loved him .
i still love him . and i love ian .
so i am totally , hopelessly in love with two men .
now we &apos;re getting somewhere . this is good .
no , this is horrible ! this wasn &apos;t supposed to happen !
i only let myself fall for ian because
i thought mike was lost to me .
and then , bang , suddenly , he wants me back ,
and now i have this choice that i can &apos;t possibly make .
i agree it &apos;s tough .
it &apos;s devastating .
if i go with mike , ian &apos;s heart will be broken ,
and ian does not deserve that .
but how can i reject mike after all he &apos;s been through ?
so you &apos;re just gonna walk away from both of them ?
you have to make a choice , sweetie .
you &apos;ve got two great guys , both of them crazy about you .
to let one go , well , that &apos;s life . it happens .
to let them both go , that &apos;s just ...
stupid ?
yes . that would be the clinical term .
sounds great . thanks .
hey , how would you like to eat
something that &apos;s neither pasta nor pizza ?
such food exists ? don &apos;t tease me .
no , my friend al , he &apos;s opening a soul food place
sunday night .
he wants to test the menu with some of his chef buddies .
he said i could bring someone .
and you want me to go with you ?
it &apos;ll be after we close .
don &apos;t tell me you hate southern food ,
because then we can &apos;t be friends .
no . i love it .
it &apos;s just , that &apos;s a little late for me , and ...
ok . i just thought it would be fun .
it would be . but sunday nights are kind of crazy .
i &apos;m packing lunches and checking homework ...
right , right , right . no worries . i get it .
you were just the first person i thought of .
you know , maybe i should go .
it &apos;s part of the job to check out the competition . right ?
yeah , absolutely .
never hurts to see what else is out there .
i agree .
hey , guys , go check out the snakes .
i &apos;ll give you some pizza later okay ?
see ya later .
all right , i &apos;ll see you later .
want some pizza ?
yeah .
there you go .
lynette , what are you doing here ?
edie asked me to cater .
i know , i &apos;m a total whore ,
but please don &apos;t rat me out to gabby .
hi , susan . i have 30 copies of your book .
the kids can &apos;t wait for you to sign it .
come on , let &apos;s go . come on , come on .
looks like we &apos;re working the same corner .
yeah . only i didn &apos;t know edie was gonna
have the party in the park .
what if gabby sees us ?
trust me , we can both relax .
i talked to her this morning and
she &apos;s out with victor all day .
that &apos;s a relief .
go ahead . i dare you .
what &apos;s going on ?
there .
hey ! don &apos;t do that !
why not ?
because she &apos;s not a witch !
how do you know ?
she isn &apos;t ! don &apos;t be a jerk !
is she your girlfriend ? parker &apos;s in love !
shut up !
hey , you boys ! knock it off !
parker , i &apos;m so sorry . are you all right ?
you know , everything would be ok if you tell people
what you told me .
you can make them stop .
hey , lynette , it &apos;s gabby .
victor got pulled into some photo @-@ op
at the homeless shelter .
i &apos;m free for lunch . you wanna go with ?
i tried susan , but she &apos;s not home , which is weird ,
because her car &apos;s in the driveway .
so is yours . where is everybody ?
down ! down ! get down !
lynette , what is wrong with you ?
gabby &apos;s coming .
what ? i thought you said she &apos;s with victor !
i was wrong . i was wrong ! come on , follow me .
mommy , can i play ?
no . go ride the python .
come on !
ok , ok , she &apos;s circling the park .
i wish she &apos;d hurry . i &apos;m terrified of snakes .
yeah , i &apos;m more terrified of gabby .
ok , good , good , we &apos;re almost home free .
what ?
don &apos;t turn around .
lynette ! susan !
hey , gab . hi .
what are you two doing here ?
what are we doing here ?
well , edie hired me to cater . so it &apos;s just business .
i don &apos;t know what her excuse is .
you are so dead .
i don &apos;t believe it
this is an absolute betrayal of our friendship .
gabby , she asked me to make 20 pizzas .
i couldn &apos;t turn it down .
this is so delicious .
is that what our friendship is worth to you , 20 pizzas ?
we had a pact !
come on , gabby , be fair .
you put us in a really awkward position .
me ? you two owe me an apology !
no . gabby , be reasonable .
i am leaving this party , right now ,
and if you don &apos;t come with me ,
our friendship is over !
gabby !
no , i mean it !
carlos , stop ! put me down !
what are you doing ?
stop it ! carlos , put me down !
how dare you maul me like that ?
you were ruining travers &apos; birthday party .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i &apos;m sorry . betrayal makes me a little cranky .
come on . you can &apos;t tell susan and lynette
who they &apos;re allowed to be friends with . it &apos;s ridiculars .
i &apos;ll tell you what ridiculous is ! you !
not having the guts to tell me you were dating edie !
here it is .
yeah .
i had to find out from her at my damn engagement party !
i had to hear that you were engaged to victor on the news !
i didn &apos;t plan it that way . it was spur of the moment .
so you just said , &quot; hey , what the heck ? &quot;
are you even in love with this guy ?
yes . deeply !
must be nice .
aren &apos;t you in love with edie ?
we &apos;re having fun together , but it &apos;ll never be serious .
so , if i &apos;m just dating ,
and you &apos;re in love and getting married ,
remind me again why it is that you get to be the angry one .
i &apos;m sorry , carlos .
you should be .
and for the first time , &lt; / i &gt;
gabrielle was willing to let carlos be with someone else ... &lt; / i &gt;
... because she knew he still belonged to her . &lt; / i &gt;
feel free to take home as much cake as you want .
i do not want to be tempted .
i might take a little for tom ...
hi , mrs. mccluskey .
would you like some cake ?
i didn &apos;t come for sweets .
i know you people have been talking about me ,
and i guess the only way to shut you up is to come clean .
so who would like to hear the gruesome details ?
i would .
if you feel like it ...
yeah .
first off , and i know this will disappoint some of you ,
but i didn &apos;t kill gilbert .
i came home from a weekend in laughlin
and found him in front of the tv . dead .
he still had the remote in his hand .
good lord .
it was 2 : 00 am .
so i decided to wait until morning to call the funeral home .
and i went to his desk to make sure everything was in order .
i found his pension plan , and guess what .
in the event of his death i was not the beneficiary .
who was ?
his first wife .
they were married when he started the job , for two years .
we were together 34 years and
that idiot didn &apos;t change the paperwork !
i not only lost my gilbert ,
but i was about to lose everything .
so , i , um ...
i , uh ...
you put him in the freezer
and kept cashing the checks .
well , what else was i gonna do ?
besides , after a while ,
it was kind of nice having him around .
anyway , that &apos;s the truth .
you ladies have my permission to pass it along ...
not that some of you ladies need it .
probably weren &apos;t expecting to see me ?
well , after 20 unanswered calls ...
no , not really .
about that , obviously i have been very confused .
but i finally saw a therapist .
actually , it was sort of a court @-@ ordered thing , anyway ...
well , i need to talk to you .
you sound sure .
i am .
i &apos;m going to marry ian .
believe me , this wasn &apos;t easy .
especially when you started to
remember how it was between us .
maybe if the timing had been different ...
yet , it wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry , mike .
well , at least i have my memories .
ready to go ?
yeah .
i told kim we &apos;d be out the rest of the evening .
she &apos;s gonna lock up .
great , i &apos;ll just get my jacket .
ok .
hey , you got a table for seven ?
hi ! what are you doing here ?
hey , mom !
well , the kids wanted to surprise you ,
and it &apos;s been forever since we &apos;ve all had dinner together ...
well , how did you get here ?
i mean , you &apos;re not supposed to drive .
i took a cab , a double dose of the painkillers , and voila .
you surprised ?
yeah , a little .
we missed you !
i missed you too .
why don &apos;t you guys go grab that big table ,
and i will have rick whip something up for us !
wow , you smell good .
oh ! it must be the basil .
it has got a sweet smell .
hey , kayla , can you get a high chair for your sister ?
yeah .
all right . who wants pizza ?
i do !
hi . change of plans .
yeah , i see .
i &apos;m sorry , you could still go .
no , no , no , i &apos;ll stay .
i &apos;ll cook for your family .
thanks . thank you .
thanks , sweetie . you are taking such good care of me .
when &apos;s lynette getting home ?
as soon as she closes up the pizzeria .
is that guy rick helping her ?
he better be , for as much as we &apos;re paying him .
i think lynette likes him .
well , sure , he &apos;s a nice guy , hard worker .
no , i mean she &quot; likes him &quot; likes him .
what makes you say that ?
just something i noticed .
well , good night , daddy .
&quot; mrs. susan hainsworth . &quot;
god , i love the sound of that .
or did you want to keep your name ?
cause i love the sound of that , too .
as long as i get to call you my wife .
deal .
you do realize we &apos;re going to be blissfully happy , don &apos;t you ?
i mean it could actually get a bit disgusting .
people might throw fruit .
i &apos;m gonna lock up down here .
why don &apos;t you go upstairs and warm up the bed ?
you do realize we &apos;re gonna be great together , don &apos;t you ?
i know .
hey , susan . i don &apos;t mean to bug you .
there &apos;s just so much i didn &apos;t get to say .
i &apos;m lousy at goodbyes .
anyway ,
you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me ,
and , well , i hope you find the happiness you deserve .
bye . oh , this is mike .
hey , susan . i don &apos;t mean to bug you .
there &apos;s just so much i didn &apos;t get to say .
i &apos;m lousy at goodbyes .
anyway ,
you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me ,
and , well , i hope you find the happiness you deserve .
bye . oh , this is mike .
where are you going ?
home .
to england .
to england ? what &apos;s wrong ?
well , it &apos;s just ... i don &apos;t think this is going to work .
what ?
just ten minutes ago we were making plans .
you were saying how great we were gonna be .
i saw you listening to that message from mike .
ian , i made my choice .
but not for the right reasons .
you &apos;re just trying to honor a promise you made to me .
that &apos;s not true .
i will get over him .
you &apos;ve been trying to get over him ,
as long as i &apos;ve known you .
haven &apos;t had much luck , have you ?
ian , i love you .
i know you do .
but you love him a little bit more , don &apos;t you ?
i can &apos;t live a life where every time
i see you with a faraway look ,
i &apos;ll wonder if you &apos;re thinking of him .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you deserve to be happy .
and so do i.
goodbye , susan .
hey , mrs. mccluskey .
lynette .
well , it turns out our new babysitter
isn &apos;t working out too well .
you feel up to another tour of duty ?
are you sure you want the wisteria witch
looking after your kids ?
my kids know you &apos;re not a witch .
too bad . i could use the leverage .
we missed you .
same here .
i &apos;m gonna need a raise though . i &apos;m strapped .
ok .
i just talked to mrs. mccluskey
and she is gonna start looking after our kids again .
that &apos;s great .
yeah .
because actually , i have been thinking ,
and it is time that i got back to work .
what ?
yeah . i &apos;m feeling good .
i &apos;m getting around better .
but the doctor said your recovery would take months ,
and it &apos;s only been six weeks .
well , it &apos;s not like i &apos;m gonna dead @-@ lift a bag of ice ,
but i can sprinkle cheese on a pizza .
besides , i hate making you run that place by yourself .
i don &apos;t mind .
really ?
before you said it was killing you .
yeah , well , you know , it is ,
but i just don &apos;t want you to come back before you &apos;re ready .
you might re @-@ injure yourself .
i &apos;ll be careful .
the best part is , we can finally get rick off the books .
rick ? why would we want to let him go ?
well , i know he &apos;s been great ,
but his salary &apos;s cutting into our profits .
actually , he is bringing in more
than enough business to cover his salary .
i mean , with all those new dishes he &apos;s cooking ,
he &apos;s got a lot of fans out there .
does he really ?
yeah .
i think firing him would be a huge mistake .
well , it was just a thought .
well , don &apos;t think so much . just rest and get better .
that &apos;s what you need to do .
you gonna be late tonight ?
probably .
we &apos;ve got a big party coming in at 10 : 00 .
so , i &apos;ll just see you in the morning .
i &apos;ll be here .
ok .
hi , ida . what &apos;s up ?
that idiot postman mixed up our mail again .
poor mr. henley . he does seem to be getting worse .
thanks for stopping by .
you heard about mike ?
no . what about him ?
he moved .
moved ? what do you mean ?
mona clarke was up at 2 : 00 in the morning with acid reflux ,
and she saw him pack his car and everything .
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
mike wouldn &apos;t leave without saying goodbye .
well , he did .
according to carlos , something bad happened ,
and mike just wanted to get the heck out of dodge .
it &apos;s a pity . i always liked him .
gossip . it &apos;s just a harmless form of recreation . &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;s careless talk that deals in polite fiction ... &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;d love to be assistant manager , but apparently
you have to flirt with mrs. scavo to get that job .
it &apos;s nasty speculation that &apos;s based on not @-@ so @-@ polite fact . &lt; / i &gt;
he may be dating edie ,
but everyone can see he &apos;s still in love with gabby .
how do we protect ourselves &lt; / i &gt;
from the venomous sting of such idle gossip ? &lt; / i &gt;
are you the lady who kept her husband in a freezer ?
the best way is to just tell the truth . &lt; / i &gt;
yep . that &apos;s me . scary , aren &apos;t i ?
and wait for people to start talking about someone else . &lt; / i &gt;
