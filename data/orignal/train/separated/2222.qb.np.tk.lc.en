come on , raintree , tell me the truth :
when you were flying those commercial buses ,
how many times you fall asleep on the job , huh ?
you give a man a hot meal ,
a comfy chair , an autopilot ...
i defy anyone not to take a nap .
man , i knew it !
yeah , i like flying , buddy .
that &apos;s why i like this .
less sleeping , more piloting .
i don &apos;t miss the heavies .
except maybe the flight attendants .
yeah , i miss them .
hey , you ever fly swissair ?
blonde , tall , always friendly . huh ?
â€­ sure . yeah .
we got a bogey at eight o &apos;clock .
yeah , i got him .
dea ?
i don &apos;t know . there &apos;s no markings .
take her down , just in case we have to dump .
down !
buddy ...
buddy ...
oh , geez ...
oh , no . oh , no ...
buddy ...
turn around .
commander ,
you understand why this was necessary .
yeah . yeah .
you don &apos;t want me to know
i &apos;m at a cia black site in morocco .
come on , boys .
17 hours on a c @-@ 5 galaxy ,
the smell of saffron and cumin as we drove through the market ,
the call to prayer from the minaret ,
and then one of your drivers was speaking in berber to his wife ,
apologizing for something he said last night .
i just hope that whatever you got
on the other side of this door is worth it .
come ...
closer .
so , you do know who i am .
you have your mother &apos;s eyes .
and her resolve , so i &apos;m told .
why am i here ?
forgive you ?
for killing wo fat ?
yeah .
he said he understood .
said that his son &apos;s obsession with revenge
was his ultimate undoing .
so you @-@ you flew all that way for
a fortune cookie quote ?
they don &apos;t got phones in morocco or what ?
clearly , it was important to this old man
that he looked me in the eye when he said what he had to say .
did he mention doris ?
yeah . yeah , he mentioned doris , briefly .
he said that despite my mother &apos;s betrayal ,
he still loved her .
the fact that she looked after his son
for as long as she did ,
whether it was out of guilt or pity or @-@ or a sense of duty ...
he said he was grateful for that .
steve . steve !
sorry , commander , he just went right by my desk .
no , it &apos;s okay , i @-@ i know him .
thanks . i got it , chief , i got it .
nahele , what &apos;s wrong ?
c.o.d. was respiratory failure
brought on by acute methamphetamine overdose .
i &apos;m waiting for toxicology ,
but i suspect they will merely confirm
what seems to be painfully obvious :
that this is yet another victim
of the same batch of fentanyl @-@ cut crystal ,
making him the 11th victim in the last two weeks alone .
this thing &apos;s an epidemic .
and else killing kids .
i found him in the locker room .
he was passed out .
he wasn &apos;t moving .
i had no idea makaio was doing drugs , you know ?
he was my friend .
i just didn &apos;t know .
you remember when i told you
i was never gonna let anybody hurt you ?
well , i made the same promise
to the people of this island when i put this badge on .
now , these sons of bitches
who are selling this stuff , they don &apos;t know it yet ,
but ... i &apos;m a man of my word .
get up .
slowly .
you all right ?
better than him .
see this guy ?
he &apos;s dead .
so is this woman .
and this guy , in the $ 1,000 suit .
but i really want you to look at this one .
look at the kid .
this kid was just 16 years old .
we all gotta go sometime , don &apos;t we ?
yeah , okay .
so ... the stuff you &apos;ve been putting in your body ,
it &apos;s cut with a powerful opiate called fentanyl ,
and most of the people who &apos;ve been using it ,
they don &apos;t live to try it again .
i guess that makes me special , doesn &apos;t it ?
no , it makes you lucky .
you &apos;re alive because of dumb luck .
you &apos;ve been putting a loaded gun to your head ,
you &apos;re just getting clicks .
but here &apos;s the thing :
i think we should put another bullet in that chamber .
you only shot half the bag .
let &apos;s use the other half , huh ?
i mean , you just said it yourself :
&quot; we all gotta go sometime . &quot;
but you &apos;re lucky , right ?
you &apos;re a lucky guy . you &apos;re special .
you just said so yourself .
you &apos;re insane , man .
what the hell do you want ?
what do i want ?
i want the name of your dealer .
angela ?
michael ?
first @-@ time user .
my friend recommended you .
well , you got a good friend .
anytime you need me , you just hit that rainbow
and like a leprechaun ,
i &apos;ll be at the end of it .
i can &apos;t tell you how happy i am to hear that .
see you around .
i &apos;m sure .
what the ... ?
i mean , i gotta give you credit .
i gotta give him credit .
using a mobile app to deliver drugs ?
it &apos;s genius .
well , you know , they really do have an app for everything .
there really is an app for everything .
smart thinking .
well , it is smart ,
but it &apos;s also very risky because , you see ,
now we have a list
of everybody that you sold drugs to .
look , man , we know this meth isn &apos;t being made
on this island . okay ?
i mean , the level of purity--
there &apos;s an industrial process going on here .
and oahu ...
is too small to run that kind of operation
without attracting attention .
see ?
he looks a little confused .
he does , doesn &apos;t he ?
let me straighten you out , in case you haven &apos;t figured out
what your part in all this is .
you &apos;re gonna tell us how it &apos;s getting here .
you &apos;re gonna give us the name of the person
who &apos;s bringing it onto the island .
all right ?
or you can spend the next 30 years of your life
living in a box , putting that back together .
might need to run it by earl scheib first .
listen , i &apos;m just transpo .
three times a week , i fly out to the green island atoll ,
pick up the cargo and bring it back .
well , that cargo &apos;s killing people , okay ?
last week , there was a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy ,
he &apos;s supposed to go to his junior prom this weekend .
well , you look surprised .
what , were you , uh ,
too busy counting your money to think about
what this garbage does to people ?
who do you work for ?
we want names .
look , if i tell you--
no , no . no negotiation .
his name &apos;s dae won .
he &apos;s the only guy i deal with .
dae won .
okay .
all right .
here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen ...
you &apos;re gonna call dae won .
and you &apos;re gonna tell him
that you can &apos;t make this next run .
and right after that , you &apos;re gonna recommend this pilot .
a great pilot ; you trust him with your life .
you &apos;re gonna recommend him .
that &apos;s not gonna work , man .
dae won &apos;s gonna know something &apos;s up-- what do i tell him ?
why don &apos;t you tell him you can &apos;t fly ?
all right .
and why &apos;s that ?
you broke my arm !
well , the good news is you don &apos;t have to lie now .
hey , nate .
this is the guy i was telling you about .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m evan raintree .
that &apos;s dave carson , my mechanic .
i just need a pilot .
wait a minute , did you talk to this guy ?
talk to me about what ?
that &apos;s my mechanic .
i don &apos;t fly without my mechanic .
we &apos;re a package deal .
if you want this job , you make an exception .
okay , all right .
i don &apos;t want the job .
why you got to waste my time , nate ?
all right , wait , wait , wait .
francis knows you . i don &apos;t .
but if you check out--
the both of you-- job &apos;s yours .
oh , i told you-- they &apos;re clean .
well , is this gonna be a problem ?
running your prints ?
no ... no , it &apos;s not gonna be a problem .
you &apos;re next , partner .
maybe we should be checking you out , huh ?
hands .
yeah , yeah , knock yourself out .
got it good ?
i &apos;ll be in touch .
that went well .
you know , he won &apos;t care if you &apos;re cops .
if you don &apos;t check out , he will kill you .
no worries .
your guy works fast .
he &apos;s already run your prints .
also got chatter on the dark net .
okay , how solid are these i.d. &apos; s that you created for us , jerry ?
they &apos;re solid so far .
as long as he doesn &apos;t dig too deep , we &apos;re good .
i think .
he thinks .
i &apos;ll go get my will sorted out .
he &apos;s kidding , right ?
i have faith in you , jerry .
thanks , mcgruff .
so you had a sit @-@ down with wo fat &apos;s father , huh ?
yeah , it , uh ...
it was not what i expected , i &apos;ll tell you that .
you know , if he was kept off the grid for 40 years ,
how did he even know that you were the one who killed his son ?
i have no idea .
but his handlers monitored the meet ,
and , uh , i don &apos;t know ,
it was clear to me that i was just there to listen .
so i take it you never even got a chance
to ask him if he knows where your mother is ?
no . but what i did get from the conversation is
that he has not seen doris for , at least , a couple of decades ,
and ... the people detaining him
are making sure those two don &apos;t connect .
well ... forgiveness is the last thing
i would ever expect from that bloodline , so ...
trust me-- take it , move on .
well , it worked for you and abby , right ?
well , seeing as she &apos;s back in san francisco
getting her things , uh ...
yeah , i guess you could say that .
how do you feel about that ?
well , let &apos;s just say i &apos;m getting used to the idea
that i &apos;m gonna have a lot more throw pillows in my life .
but ...
i &apos;m good with all of it .
good .
how about your niece ?
sarah .
she &apos;s still with child services .
you know how long that can take , right ?
it &apos;s not just about finding a home , steve .
it &apos;s about finding the right home .
i see that look on your face .
don &apos;t think it hasn &apos;t crossed my mind .

i want a name .
you need to give me a name .
do it . go ahead .
danny ...
do it .
hello .
what is it ?
it &apos;s steve . come on .
hey , doc , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not good news .
commander mcgarrett has suffered
a devastating trauma to his liver .
a bullet has cut it into multiple fragments ,
making the entire organ inoperable .
if he doesn &apos;t receive a new liver in the next few hours ,
he will die .
uncle steve was hurt pretty bad .
the doctor says he needs a new liver .
but they said there &apos;s not enough time to wait
to find a donor either on the island or in the mainland .
i &apos;m in . me , too .
same here .
we can certainly run some tests
and determine which , if any , of you
are the correct tissue match for commander mcgarrett .
let me , um , just save everybody some time .
uh , steve and i are the same blood type .
um , so just-- let &apos;s use mine .
doesn &apos;t my dad need his liver ?
you know , i didn &apos;t know this ,
but the liver is actually an amazing organ .
it can completely regenerate .
so , they &apos;re gonna take half of your father &apos;s liver
and give it to uncle steve ,
and then , in time ,
both livers will grow to normal size .
doc , do me a favor .
let &apos;s just go in there and get it over with , huh ?
okay .
all right ?
will do .
thanks , doc .
hey , what are you doing , monkey ?
you know i got a broken rib , right ?
what are you doing , huh ?
what are you upset for ?
everything &apos;s gonna be all right . i promise .
wipe those tears away .
what are you doing ?
how are you holding up ?
first you , and now mcgarrett .
i &apos;m just tired of us getting shot at .
oh , come on .
you &apos;ve not even gonna give me my money ?
lou ...
i &apos;m trippin &apos; , man .
i &apos;m ... sorry . i ...
we &apos;re all feeling it , lou .
you know , when i first met mcgarrett ,
i couldn &apos;t stand his ass .
and if you would &apos;ve told me
that the day would come ...
when i &apos;m in a hospital corridor ...
... torn up inside , almost to the point of tears , because ...
... my man is in a room ,
with his life hanging in the balance ...
and ...
i swear , man , i &apos;d gladly take his place .
i &apos;d have told you , you was off your meds .
damn , that man can get under your skin !
yeah , yeah , he can .
you know , when i first lost malia ,
as you might imagine , i was in a ...
pretty dark place .
but mcgarrett ...
it was like he knew i wasn &apos;t sleeping .
this guy would call me up
in the middle of the night and be like ,
&quot; yo , chin , what are you doing ? &quot;
i &apos;d be , like ,
&quot; nothing . &quot;
nothing ?
he would say , &quot; you want to go grab some coffee ? &quot;
so we &apos;d go to this place near me .
and we &apos;d just sit there .
sometimes we would talk ,
other times , we wouldn &apos;t say much of anything .
and this went on for weeks .
now , he never said anything to anybody .
he never mentioned it .
this was something he did
because he knew i couldn &apos;t bear to be alone .
you know , he was there for me ,
like , when my father died ,
john mcgarrett was there for me .
two times in my life , i really needed a friend ...
and both times that friend was named mcgarrett .
they &apos;re gonna be okay .
thank you , doc .
hey , boss .
why is it that people never say what they want to say
until something like this happens ?
the day i met you ...
six years ago , at waimea bay ...
you changed my life .
you gave me more than just a job ...
you gave me a family .
and i never told you how much
i appreciate it all .
mahalo .
&quot; get your tuchas out of bed , tough guy .
&quot; you got six months to get into game shape for the turkey bowl .
with love and aloha , nicky &apos; the kid &apos; demarco . &quot;
did he , uh ... did he mention me at all ?
uh ... no . just steve .
here &apos;s one from governor denning .
&quot; commander mcgarrett , on behalf of myself
&quot; and the entire state capital &apos; ohana ,
&quot; we wish you best wishes on a speedy recovery .
sincerely , governor denning . &quot;
it &apos;s nice , isn &apos;t it ?
is that it ?
yeah .
you know , i &apos;m sure
there &apos;s one in here for you . here .
let &apos;s see ...
here &apos;s one .
uh , no , it &apos;s for steve .
you can read it , anyway .
i think it &apos;s from sang min .
the handwriting is terrible .
sang min ?
&quot; i woulda offered you my liver , mcgurrett ,
but we both know it &apos;s no god . &quot;
i guess he meant &quot; good . &quot;
aloha , everybody .
s &apos;up , party people ?
hey , guys .
sorry we &apos;re late .
hey , guys .
you know , if a stranger was to pass by this room ,
they &apos;d get the impression you two boys
were a couple of rock stars .
yeah , yeah . him . him , not me .
i &apos;m just the roadie , i think .
well , we have some good news .
we , uh , leveraged dae won
into giving up his contact on the korean side .
there &apos;s a dea task force
in the process of shutting down his entire operation .
all right .
thought you &apos;d want to know .
that &apos;s excellent . good work , everybody , good work .
as reluctant as i am
to bring attention to the outstanding matter
of my going @-@ away party ...
but unless we are at rumfire in 23 minutes ,
we will lose our reservation .
no , i get it . listen , if i had a choice
between a cold beer and sitting around here with us ,
i know what i &apos;d do .
well , since you put it like that ...
all right . you heard the man .
let &apos;s leave &apos; em alone .
we &apos;ll see you back soon , all right ?
thanks , buddy . yeah .
thanks , man .
thanks , chin . good work .
so , uh , adam &apos;s out in four months
and he &apos;s got it in his head that you guys are going surfing .

bye , charlie .
dog .
where &apos;s the , uh ...
uh , channel 36 . there &apos;s a game on .
no , i want to watch this .
you &apos;re dangling the senate seat like ...
you &apos;re gonna make me to watch a soap opera ?
a game &apos;s gonna keep me up . i want to go to sleep .
this &apos;ll put me to sleep .
you want to go to sleep ?
i could bounce this lamp off your head ; you &apos;ll go right out .
you want me to turn it up ?
whoever &apos;s idea it was to have me share a room with you
to help me with my recovery is a complete idiot .
you realize you didn &apos;t have to give me your liver .
where were you gonna get one , steve ?
at the supermarket ?
of course i had to give you my liver ,
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m gonna have to listen to this
for the rest of my life , aren &apos;t i ?
i &apos;m gonna have to listen to this forever ,
this @-@ this @-@ this speech about the
selfless sacrifice you made on my behalf .
no , no , no , &apos; cause steve , i am not like you , okay ?
i give without the expectation of thanks .
â€­ all right ?
and do me a favor , please .
try to take care of the thing .
i had it for 39 years . it means a lot to me , okay ?
you &apos;ll probably wreck it in two weeks .
how am i gonna wreck it ?
i don &apos;t know .
you like getting shot at .
what do i know ?
i like getting shot ?
you think i chose to get shot ?
how about this ?
if i hadn &apos;t have taken those bullets for you ,
it &apos;d be my liver in your body . how &apos; bout that ?
hold on . hold on ...
you didn &apos;t save my life , steve .
you were on the wrong side of the plane
when we got shot at .
okay ? that &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; b , &quot; there is zero chance ,
if the roles were reversed here ,
you &apos;d be giving me a piece of your liver , okay ? no chance .
how can you say that ?
you sayin &apos; i &apos;m not generous that way ?
no , you &apos;re not generous .
i &apos;ve never even seen you take your wallet out of your pocket .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re giving me one of your vital organs .
if this liver comes with your negative attitude ,
i swear to god i &apos;m gonna cut it out myself .
that &apos;s crazy . that &apos;s crazy .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m asking for a &quot; thank you , &quot; steve .
i &apos;m not saying give me a speech
or a gift or anything like that ,
but you ... you &apos;re just ...
you &apos;re a big , giant ingrate .
you know ?
my son , who i gave bone marrow to ,
he was more grateful than you are .
but come to think of it , he &apos;s four years old
and he &apos;s more emotionally mature than you ,
so it makes complete and total sense .
he &apos;s a kid .
i promise you , danny ,
you give him time , he &apos;s gonna grow up to hate you
just as much as i do .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
you do realize the curtain doesn &apos;t block sound , right ?
i know you can still hear me .
