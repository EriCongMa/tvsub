i &apos;ll get candles and my mom &apos;s lace tablecloth .
and since it &apos;s rachel &apos;s birthday ...
... i thought i &apos;d poach a salmon .
what ?
question . why do we always have parties where you poach things ?
you want to be on the food committee ?
question 2 . why do we always have parties with committees ?
why can &apos;t we just get pizza and beer and have fun ?
i agree . fancy parties are only fun if you &apos;re fancy on the inside .
and i &apos;m not sure we are .
you don &apos;t want it to be special ?
fine . you can throw any kind of party you want .
joey , they &apos;re not real !
i start miles beneath the surface of these things . they &apos;re fake .
see ? honk , honk !
wow , it &apos;s like porno for clowns !
the one with two parties
neither of rachel &apos;s sisters can come .
i still have to invite dylan and emma and shannon cooper .
no shannon cooper .
why not her ?
because she ....
she steals stuff .
or maybe she doesn &apos;t and joey slept with her and never called her back .
joey , that is horrible .
hey , i liked her .
maybe too much .
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i just got scared .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t think anyone would buy that . okay !
hi , honey . how did it go ?
it was the graduation from hell .
my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship .
it &apos;s supposed to be a joyous occasion .
nobody thought my sister would graduate from college .
it &apos;s a testament to what a girl from long lsland will do for a celica .
what happened ?
my parents happened .
all they had to do was sit in the same stadium , smile ...
... and not talk about the divorce . but no !
they got into a fight during the commencement address .
bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them .
you know the good news ?
i get to serve coffee for the next eight hours .
i guess we don &apos;t invite her parents .
how about just her mom ?
why her mom ?
because i already invited her .
did you ask stacy roth ?
can &apos;t invite her .
she also steals .
so does her roommate .
here are the candles . where &apos;s the birthday cake ?
we &apos;re not having birthday cake .
we &apos;re having birthday flan .
excuse me ?
it &apos;s a traditional mexican custard dessert .
that &apos;s nice .
happy birthday , rachel . here &apos;s some goo !
dr. greene !
oh , my god ! it &apos;s rachel &apos;s dad .
why are you here ?
the father can &apos;t see the daughter on her birthday ?
no , no , the father can .
but since i am the roommate , i can tell you she &apos;s not here .
and i &apos;ll pass along the message . okay ? so bye @-@ bye .
you &apos;re having a party .
no , no , not a party .
just a surprise gathering of some people rachel knows .
this is phoebe , chandler and joey .
i &apos;ll never remember all that .
so what &apos;s the deal ?
rachel comes home , people pop out and yell stuff ? is that it ?
this isn &apos;t your first surprise party , is it , sir ?
hi , monica .
the chinese menu guy . forgot the menus .
so basically , just a chinese guy .
dr. greene , come with me . we &apos;ll put your jacket on rachel &apos;s bed .
all right . that sounds like a two @-@ person job .
well , my goodness ! what was that ?
sandra , i thought you were rachel . we weren &apos;t ready for you yet .
you thought i was rachel ?
yes , because you look so young .
and because you &apos;re both , you know , white women .
oh , i missed you kids . should i put my coat in the bedroom ?
no , i &apos;ll take that for you .
oh , well , thank you .
such a gentleman . thank you .
it all looks so nice . so festive . all the balloons .
oh , the funniest thing happened to me on the way here .
i was driving
that &apos;s great !
i can &apos;t wait to hear the rest , but i have to go to the bathroom .
hey , come with me .
what ?
lt will be like we &apos;re gal pals .
you know , like at a restaurant . it &apos;ll be fun ! come on .
oh , my god . oh , my god . oh , my god !
think . think .
what would jack and chrissy do ?
okay , now that your coat is safely in the bed
we can come back out in the living room .
joey and chandler , it &apos;s time you take dr. greene over to your place .
yes , absolutely .
why , again ?
because that &apos;s where the party is , you goon !
see , this is just the staging area .
right , it &apos;s the staging area .
this is clearly in the wrong apartment .
all right , you guys are off to party number one .
and you ....
you are off to party number two .
all right , let &apos;s keep it moving , let &apos;s keep it moving .
at least send some women to my party .

let &apos;s put them together . if they can &apos;t deal with it , who cares ?
i do .
that &apos;s who .
are you gonna be okay ?
i don &apos;t really have a choice . i can look at the bright side .
i get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes .
well , actually ...
... just one birthday flan .
it &apos;s a traditional mexican custard dessert .
talk to monica . she &apos;s on the food committee .
some girl just walked up to me and said , &quot; i want you , dennis ... &quot;
... and stuck her tongue down my throat .
i love this party !
quick volleyball question .
volleyball .
we set up a court in your room .
you didn &apos;t like that gray lamp , did you ?
a woman stuck her tongue down my throat . i &apos;m not even listening to you .
dennis !
okay , that &apos;s me .
can you keep dad occupied ? i &apos;m gonna talk to mom for a while .
do you have any ideas for any openers ?
stay clear of &quot; i &apos;m the guy that &apos;s doing your daughter ... &quot;
... and you should be okay .
i want you to take a piece of paper
here you go . and write down your most embarrassing memory .
when you &apos;re not using the markers , put the caps back on them ...
... because they will dry out .
hi , dr. greene .
so how &apos;s everything in the ...
... vascular surgery ...
... game ?
it &apos;s not a game , ross . a woman died on my table today .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s the good thing about my job .
all the dinosaurs on my table are already dead .
listen , i don &apos;t mean to be a pain about this ...
... but i &apos;ve noticed some of you are just placing them on .
you want to push the caps ...
... until you hear them click .
gunther !
where you going ?
i was sort of thinking about maybe
no ! no , you can &apos;t go ! no , this is fun .
we &apos;re just starting . here &apos;s your marker .
if you want to go , just go .
she &apos;ll yell at me again .
all right , i can get you out .
what ?
in a minute , i &apos;ll create a diversion .
when i do , walk quickly to the door and don &apos;t look back .
i think i need a drink .
i &apos;ll get it for you .
what do you want ?
scotch .
i &apos;ll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass .
neat !
cool .
neat , as in no rocks .
i know .
hello , ross ! where have you been ?
i have been in the bathroom .
stay clear of the salmon mousse .
scotch neat .
that &apos;s rachel &apos;s father &apos;s drink .
mine too . isn &apos;t that neat ?
scotch neat .
would you excuse me ?
where are you sneaking off to , mister ?
i &apos;m getting my cigarettes .
no .
what do you mean &quot; no &quot; ?
see , because that &apos;s the staging area .
you go in there , it &apos;ll ruin the whole illusion of the party .
take your scotch back in there ...
... and i will get your cigarettes for you , sir .
get my glasses too .
all righty @-@ roo .
what a great moment to say that for the first time .
okay , the first person &apos;s most embarrassing memory is ...
... &quot; monica , your party sucks . &quot;
very funny .
oh , no ! did someone forget to use a coaster ?
what ?
i don &apos;t see anything .
great , i &apos;m seeing water rings again .
ross , whose glasses are those ?
mine .
you wear bifocals ?
i have a condition apparently ...
... that i require ...
... two different sets of focals .
do you know my husband has glasses just like that ?
well , those are very popular frames .
neil sedaka wears them .
i hear you can get people out of here .
you didn &apos;t tell me your boyfriend smokes .
yeah , like a chimney .
big smoker .
big , big smoker .
in fact , i &apos;m gonna go into the hallway and fire up this bad boy .
are you wearing my glasses ?
yes .
i was just warming up the earpieces for you .
thank you .
is that one of my cigarettes ?
yes , it is . i was just moistening the tip .
she &apos;s taking the trash out , so i can get you out of here .
but it has to be now . she &apos;ll be back any minute .
what about my friend ?
only the three of you . any more and she &apos;ll get suspicious .
let me just get my coat .
there isn &apos;t time !
just leave everything .
they &apos;ll take care of you next door .
is it true they have beer ?
everything you &apos;ve heard is true .
could you guys please keep it down ?
we &apos;re trying to start a boggle tournament .
if people find out they &apos;re playing spelling games ...
... there &apos;ll be nobody left here .
you !
and you .
you &apos;re supposed to be at my party .
and gunther !
what are you doing here ?
welcome to the fo
all right , i &apos;m sorry . but these people needed me .
they work hard all week . it &apos;s saturday night .
they deserve to have a little fun . go !
you know , my party is fun .
it &apos;s a little quieter , less obvious sort of fun .
but if people would just give it a chance , it &apos;s
you want me to see a therapist ?
sweetheart , you have a problem .
you &apos;ve chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father .
okay , mom , i &apos;ll make an appointment .
but right now , i gotta go . i gotta go do a thing .
did you know your mother spent $ 1200 on bonsai trees ?
i felt like gulliver .
daddy , i really want to hear more about this ...
... but i just have to do some stuff .
you work and you work and you work at a marriage ...
... but all he cares about is his stupid boat .
you work and you work and you work on a boat .
he always ridiculed my pottery classes .
and you sand it and varnish it .
but when all is said and done , he still drinks out of the mugs .
one night of her yoga and bridges of madison county ....
the scotch , the cigarettes ....
the bonsais and the chihuahua ....
i may have only been in therapy for three weeks now but
what the hell does she want with half a boat ?
okay , okay , you can be shirts and i &apos;ll be skins .
i &apos;ll be skins !
how you holding up there , tiger ?
sorry . when my parents were getting divorced , i got a lot of &quot; tigers . &quot;
i got a lot of &quot; champs , &quot; &quot; chiefs , &quot; &quot; sports . &quot;
i even got a &quot; governor . &quot;
this is it , isn &apos;t it ? this is what my life will be like .
my mom there , my dad there .
thanksgiving , christmas .
she gets the house , he &apos;s in a condo my sister will decorate with wicker .
how did you get through this ?
i relied on a carefully regimented program ...
... of denial ...
... and wetting the bed .
you know , i just it &apos;s so weird .
i mean , i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other .
all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july .
because it reminded you of the way ...
... our forefathers used to bitch at each other ?
it &apos;s just this thing . every year we would ...
... go out on my dad &apos;s boat and watch the fireworks .
mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big .
my sister jill would be throwing up over the side ...
... and dad would be upset because nobody helped .
and when we did help , he &apos;d scream at us for doing it wrong .
but then when the fireworks started , everybody just shut up .
you know , and it &apos;d get really cold .
and we &apos;d all just sort of smoosh under this one blanket .
it never occurred to anybody to bring another one .
and now it &apos;s ....
yeah , i know .
thanks for coming . i hope you had fun .
all right , i &apos;m hitting the road .
now , i &apos;ve left my 10 verbs on the table .
be sure and send me that finished poem .
okay , will do . glad you came .
i think i saw rachel out in the hall .
let me go check .
your mom wants to say goodbye .
happy birthday , sweetie .
you drive safe .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting ready for the water skiing .
okay , big hug . one more . come on !
how are you ?
where are you going ?
to get my coat .
we &apos;ll get that for you .
all right , all right . i can get my own coat .
sorry , we &apos;re on a major flan high .
oh , no . no , you &apos;re not supposed to be here .
this is the staging area . it &apos;s all wrong . you should leave .
you know , just get out .
or perhaps you &apos;d like a creme de menthe .
i have to be heading toward my chateau .
i guess we &apos;re going back into the hallway again .
thanks for coming , mrs. greene .
you take care .
oh , you kids .
well .
this is the best party i &apos;ve been to in years .
thank you !
okay , everybody , it &apos;s time for flan !
yep ! get ready for the gelatinous fun .
looks like that stuff you get when you get an infection .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
okay , rachel , make a special flan wish .
okay , i &apos;ve got one .
heads up !
