"Puttin' on the Ritz"
As anyone who's ever had their tonsils out can tell you,
surgery isn't cheap.
It takes a lot of money to keep a hospital's doors open.
And when the fund's run out,
it's on us to get out there and raise some more.
Which means...
It's time to put on makeup.
It's time to dress up right.
It's time to get things started on "The muppet show" to--
Crap. Sorry.
I've been watching a lot of children's television lately.
Are we ready to go?
But you get the idea.
Uh, almost. Someone doesn't want to put her shoes on.
Can I just get a word?
Hey.
Hey. I, uh... really hope this red carpet
is something you had laying around the house, Avery.
We're trying to raise money tonight, not waste it.
I grew up in this world. I know how it works.
We're attracting serious people with serious money
and tailoring an event to them.
Tonight is gonna be tasteful, sophisticated, conservative.
Come in.
You and I have very different definitions
of the word "Conservative."
Cheers!
Ari... what did you spend my money on?
This is what you want. You want spectacle-- Pizzazz.
Do I look like someone who wants pizzazz?
When people think of hospitals,
they think of death, disease... old people.
Not sexy. We are giving them Las Vegas.
We are giving them a show.
People are more inclined to open their wallets
if they're having fun.
He's falling apart.
He's refused to use incentive spirometry.
Look, and his right lung is just about ready to collapse.
If he wants to suffer, then maybe we let him.
Oh, so you're gonna let him die because he hurt your feelings?
There isn't anything that he can say to me
that I haven't heard from my mother a thousand times.
I'm bulletproof.
But we can force all the treatment on him we want.
It won't make a difference
if he decides he does not want to fight for himself.
Maybe he just needs to see what it feels like to hit bottom.
Dr. Bailey?
Radiology wants to see you
regarding Gene Steer's P.E.T. scan results.
Um, call respiratory, and get Dr. Webber started on C.P.A.P.
Oh, he is not going to like that.
He doesn't have to like it.
He just has to do it.
Trade assignments with me.
No.
You're in a bad mood because your crappy boyfriend
didn't invite you to the gala.
But you know what's gonna make you feel better?
Spending a night on the peds floor...
With all of the delightful little children.
Or I could just punch my crappy boyfriend in the junk.
Why not both?
Shane, trade with me.
I'm a surgeon, not a babysitter.
Me either. Why do I get screwed?
Cruel twist of fate?
Hey! Ross. Edwards.
It's just the two of you down here tonight,
so if you find yourselves in over your head,
call a grown-up.
If C.T.'s nagative, give him fluids and send him home.
Don't we look spiffy.
Yeah, I do.
You look like crap.
I haven't had a chance to freshen up yet, you ass.
Watch your back! Coming through!
Holy heck.
Hey, what's the story?
Once upon a time, three idiots got wasted
and ran their car into a tree.
They're drunk?
No, high as kites.
Lucky they were the only ones that got hurt.
Hey, Sinatra, I'll give you a fiver for a glass of wine.
Sir, what'd you take?
It's heroin. Add a tox screen to their trauma labs.
What's your name?
No I.D. on any of 'em.
We've been going with John, Jerry, and Jake doe.
Cute.
Okay, let's hustle, get a full trauma workup
so I can get upstairs and run a brush through my hair.
Meredith Grey, as I live and breathe.
I haven't seen you in ages. How's, uh...
Derek liking maternity leave?
He's on paternity leave.
Yeah, okay.
We have a deal.
I don't work. Neither does he.
It's working out well.
I live in your house. You're bored out of your minds.
Yeah, they've got all this pent-up surgical energy
and now everything's a competition.
It is not.
And he's winning.
Oh. He is not winning.
He couldn't even get Zola to put her shoes on tonight.
I did that. I got her to put her shoes on.
So I'm winning.
I need to come back to work.
Drink?
Ooh. Excuse me.
That's the creepiest waiter I've ever seen.
Bailey's gonna lose her mind. She can't stand clowns.
This is gonna be hilarious.
Bailey's not coming.
What?! Wait, we can do that?
Okay, I have been dreading having to be in the same room
with Arizona. If this isn't mandatory, I'm going home.
Wait, nobody's going home.
I'm giving 10% of tonight's take
to the department that raises the most money.
Spread the...word.
Derek is really good at this kind of thing.
I should get started before he does.
Oh, I think he already has.
Amazing.
Oh, come on.
I have to confess something. I know who you are.
I saw your video from the T.E.D. conference
And I just -- I'm sorry. I'm a little starstruck.
Really?
Yeah...you know, I go every year, and...
so many of the talks often focus on the tech
or something clever, but yours...
you spoke from the heart. You might be surprised...
...the truth. You're an inspiration.
If I lost my wife in a plane crash --
Oh, I'm sorry. What?
Your wife. She...passed away, right?
Yes...she did.
It's...
It's been really hard.
Cristina.
You and I have to join forces
so that Derek does not win Avery's money.
Prison's changed you.
We are in trouble.
Avery bet the farm on this party.
Listen to you two.
This is not that difficult. Just be charming.
Use the same skills you would if you were
picking someone up at a bar. I know you know how to do that.
And you need to practice
if we're gonna get serious about meeting new people.
You need to let that go.
Ooh, richie rich, 10:00.
Mr. Steers, I know this is hard to hear,
but the P.E.T. scan showed your cancer has spread.
I'm afraid surgery is no longer an option.
I'll tell you what's hard --
this pillow.
Why don't you have that oriental nurse bring me a new one?
Gene... We've talked about this.
Victoria is from the Philippines.
That's what I said.
No, it isn't!
Okay, fine.
So no surgery. What's that mean?
More chemo? What's the next step?
We talked about worst case scenarios
before the P.E.T. scan, and...
this...is it.
Um, these are brochures from several local facilities
that can help ease you into the final stages.
When you're ready, we can talk about which might be the best fit.
Best fit is gonna be the one with topless nurses.
I don't need any of that fully nude business.
They don't serve booze at the joints
where the girls ditch their skivvies.
Matter of fact, how about I slip you a tenner,
you slip me a bottle of somethin'?
I'll be available when you're ready to talk about your options.
I'll call if I start to feel weepy.
What are you doing?
Eating shrimp at a party.
I just spent 20 minutes talking to donors about you
when they'd prefer to be talking to you.
You need to -- Alex...
Have you been listening to me?
I gotta get some air.
Alex!
Where the hell are you going?
Hey, Jackson!
Champagne?
This is amazing!
Oh, the magician...incredible.
This is warm.
Oh, yeah, big bird said there's no ice.
Apparently, a miscommunication between the caterer and the venue.
Cooling blankets.
We have some back at the hospital.
They can bring a patient's temperature down in minutes, right?
No reason those can't chill a bottle.
That's ridiculous.
Then it's on theme for the night.
And I can't leave.
Um... could you please run back and grab 'em?
What? No, but, uh, the magician is the--
Please?
Please...
Fine.
And that is not even close to the strangest thing I've seen.
Though, honestly, that story I don't think is, uh...
appropriate.
Well, I'll tell you what, chief.
I'm gonna take a walk over to that table,
and I'm gonna stick a little somethin' in that cash box.
Now when I come back,
maybe you'll be a little less reluctant
to give up the goods, Owen.
Well, now I want to hear that story.
Emma Marling.
Owen Hunt.
Oh, chief of surgery.
Well, I guess Grey Sloan is pulling out its "A" game tonight.
I wasn't sure when I got a load of the clowns.
Oh, come on. Clowns are great.
People love clowns.
You worried me there for a second.
I was afraid you and I weren't gonna have anything to talk about.
Oh, really?
Hey, um... buy you a drink?
Isn't it an open bar?
The price is right.
Okay.
Thanks.
What was that?
What was what?
That whole sparkly eye thing.
Well, I can't help it if my eyes have a natural sparkle.
You were flirting.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go juggle some balls.
You just brought a knife to a gun fight.
Arizona?
Hey, um... it turns out we needed more... I.V. kits up in peds,
but I can't seem to find them.
Do you need a hand?
No, no. Um, I'll be fine.
Okay. Just gonna...
grab these.
Cool.
Jake's febrile and he's got a crazy-high white count.
You factor in the heroin,
and we're probably looking at endocarditis.
And I think he's got a pericardial effusion.
So he could tamponade at the drop of a hat.
And there's another multiple trauma on its way in.
This is like medical whac-a-mole. I love it.
Kepner said we should call someone if we're in over our heads.
Oh, good. Dr. Karev.
Hey, I just wanted to follow up
on the abdominal pain kid.
C.T. was negative,
So we gave him a couple fluid boluses and sent him home.
Great, uh, what about those guys?
Uh, they're pretty banged up, but nothing we can't handle.
Great. Good. Uh, keep it up.
Nothing we can't handle?
We've been preparing for this all year.
They have their party tonight. This is ours. Enjoy it.
Oh, he's bleeding from his chest tube.
Did you check his coags?
Uh, they're still pending.
Uh, get me a petroleum dressing and some gauze!
And call X-ray to get here stat!
Doctors! Incoming!
You want to call someone, or do you wanna be a rock star?
Somebody call the blood bank,
make sure they've got plenty of O-neg on deck.
I want those trauma rooms ready for action.
Anyone who can be moved, move them!
We need all the empty beds we can get!
Hey! You heard her. Lock and load!
Okay, let's move!
I know, look.
Isn't that something?
You pulled a sleeping baby out of day care to do your dirty work?
You're disgusting.
He's got his mother's sparkle.
Hello, baby.
Oh, and he's hungry.
Convenient.
He's my guy.
I'm gonna kill you dead.
Oh, you're under a lot of pressure at work.
Lots of late nights and weekends.
But still, you stay active. Lots of, uh, physical activity?
You can tell all that from my pulse?
Sure... and the way the tux fits.
Oh, my, this watch is gorgeous.
It's vintage. It was my father's, actually.
He, uh... he-- he would wager watches.
And so he won this one.
You know, you need another one.
I'll be right back.
There is a gal over there doing close-up magic.
You have to see it.
Emma Marling, this is Dr. Cristina Yang--
Our best cardio fellow.
How's it hanging?
Go on. You're missing the magic.
Whiskey soda.
Coming right up.
You are barking up the wrong tree with that one.
You're never gonna get a donation out of her.
Those shoes-- outlet mall all the way.
You want...
that.
What--that old lady?
That old lady in Chanel. Here you go.
Thank you.
Go get 'em, tiger.
It was a beautiful service, but after...
little Sofia just kept asking...
"Why is mommy not coming home with us?"
You are so strong.
No, it's--
Really, it's my work that's kept me strong.
This... this hospital, you know, these-- these people.
That's beautiful.
Where can I make my donation?
Right over there next to the stairs.
The nights are the hardest, though.
I know exactly what you mean.
Ever since Harvey died,
I can't fall asleep in our bed.
I spend all of my nights on the couch...
with the cat.
Exactly.
Wait, what?
What is the matter with you?
I-I know this is a difficult time,
but you cannot talk to my nurses that way.
Your move.
What?
I figured out your problem. Your mind is all closed off.
Oh--oh, my mind is closed?
We need to get it fired up so you can figure out
how you're gonna get this cancer out of me.
Here... I figured you'd want to play black, 'cause, well...
you know.
If there was anything I thought we could try...
There is.
Make a move.
Yeah, I have other patients.
I-I can't just stand here and--
What would Rosa Parks say?
Excuse me?
Or Martin Luther King?
You think they would just stand over there
and make excuses like you are?
You people are supposed to be tougher than this.
Yeah, oh, I believe that you and I
have reached the end of our ability to work together.
I'll have a counselor come by
and talk to you about the brochures.
Oh, I see.
You're giving up on me because you don't like the way I talk.
You're just gonna let me die 'cause I offend you.
I am trying to give you the best care I possibly can
despite the fact that you offend me.
You are rude and demeaning,
and I am still trying to help you move on
in the most comfortable way possible.
I am not going to move on.
I'm not gonna pass away or go to heaven or make a journey home.
I am going to die.
My lungs are gonna deflate.
I'm gonna lose control of my bowels.
My tongue's gonna roll to the back of my head.
I am going to be dead.
There's no making it sound nice or pretty.
It is not good. I am going to cease to exist.
And I don't want to. I am not ready.
So get off your ass and do something!
What the hell are you doing?
He needs a pericardiocentesis.
Yeah, we can't just do that.
I thought you wanted to be a rock star.
That was before you started talking about
shoving needles into hearts.
Stop! I'm calling someone.
Not yet.
Shane!
Not yet.
This is really very sweet of you.
But you know, you don't have to--
You don't have to sit here with me.
I don't mind.
I just...
I can't stand the way she looks at me,
the way that everyone looks at me.
Uh, no one's looking at you.
Please.
I grew up gay.
I know what it feels like when people are staring.
You're missing a leg, and they stare.
And everyone knows you're a cheater, and they stare.
And they talk, and they judge, and they... stare.
Like that.
What?
C-come on now, you were telling a story.
I know--
I know how you must feel about me.
And I know you try and hide it,
but I can see it on your face.
What do you think you see?
You know...
Jesus.
Oh, come on.
Oh, what, to be--it's-- I-I'm incapable of empathy
because I go to church? What is that about?
I can empathize like nobody's business,
especially with a cheater.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'm sorry for calling you a cheater.
I am, though.
I know.
She stared at me, too.
But the way she stared...
felt... really, really good.
You know?
Actually, I do.
And then... he chainsawed his leg off.
But that's not even close to the strangest thing I've seen.
Though, honestly, I'm not sure that story is appropriate.
Gentlemen, that story's gonna have to wait.
Okay, I look forward to it.
I've been watching you.
Chatting up our donors, stealing my stories.
You're a thief.
You've been watching me?
Who are you?
Dr. Emma Marling,
maternal-fetal medicine, Seattle Pres.
After that storm, we've been hurting, too...
Badly.
I've been pushing our board to throw a fund-raiser for weeks,
and I can't get any traction. So here I am...
Borrowing yours. I'm not a thief.
You stole my story.
It's a good story.
I don't get this. You are here to get donations,
and you spend all this time talking to me.
You-you want me to say it?
I mean, look at you.
Impressive party.
Another whiskey soda.
That's your fifth one.
Who are you, my mom?
I'm not drinking. Gotta stay sharp.
This is for the C.F.O. of A.E.C. Interactive.
Got him on the ropes.
Every drink he knocks back is another "zero" added to the check
I collect at the end of the night.
That sounds wrong.
Right and wrong don't live here, son.
This is the wild west.
This is so much fun!
It's like when we were interns--
stealing surgeries, playing dirty.
I don't really get to do that anymore.
Does this look stupid?
The kid spit up on my dress,
and in my dress... all over, really.
Oh, for the love of god, Mer.
You're making it so easy.
Every night, Harvey would whisper, "I love you" into my ear
just as I was falling asleep.
It's been ten years since, and still,
every night, I feel like I can hear his voice.
Do you ever feel like that-- like she's still with you?
All right.
Can I have your attention, please?
Oh, speech! speech! Everybody, hush up!
Oh, sorry. He's gonna talk now.
Thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Dr. Jackson Avery.
And on behalf of the board of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital,
I just want to say, "welcome."
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now over the past year, we have seen many changes,
from a change in name to a change in leadership...
and it has all been a challenge.
But it's been a challenge that we've all
been more than happy to accept.
Thank you.
As surgeons--
Wait!
Was that part of it?
I don't think so.
Oh, no, no, no! You need to stop.
You could have internal injuries or breaks.
Um... I think I'm okay. See?
I'm okay. I'm fine.
So, yeah, I'd say there's a break.
What's the update on those paramedics, Avery?
Should be here any minute.
No pulse. Okay. Hold still. This is gonna hurt.
Ready on my count. One, two...
Three!
Do you think he's watching?
Who?
Richie rich. 'cause we look freaking amazing right now.
Cristina, gross!
Edwards, someone better be dying.
I'm really hoping to avoid that, Dr. Yang.
Ross is doing a pericardial window in the E.R.
Okay, when he aspirates the fluid,
get him to the O.R. I'm on my way.
Go. We got this.
This way, guys.
Where are you going?
Oh, back to the hospital.
Some junkie with endocarditis is tamponading.
Which junkie? - There's more than one?
It's all about forgiveness.
And that's... that's what's important.
You--he... he sees me for who I am.
And he accepts me for what I've done.
But that's-- that's everything.
Are we talking about Matthew or Jesus?
Dr. Robbins?
Yes!
You paged me...
Hi.
To a closet?
I need you to run across to the gala
and grab a bottle of champagne because
We're low.
We are low.
You want me to steal booze
from the party I wasn't invited to?
And snacks!
Screw this day.
Uh, thank you, Murphy.
Thank you.
You think Callie's ever gonna forgive me?
Probably not.
She's telling everybody at the gala that you're dead.
You know, we're about ready to roll.
Hey, I'm coming, too.
How are we doing on our fund-raising goal?
Oh, we're not even halfway there.
Well, then you've got plenty to do here.
I'm worrying about internal injuries.
Make sure they rush her to C.T.
All right.
You're not coming?
We're on maternity leave. We have a deal.
Mer,
let's go. We need all hands on deck.
Let me go!
Let go!
Dr. Webber--please!
Dr. Webber--
I-I can take it from here.
I can take it.
Let go!
I don't want this.
There's a man down the hall. He is ornery.
He's a jackass. He's dying.
And he won't stop fighting,
even though there isn't anything I can do for him.
And then I've got you.
You've got a million options, and you refuse to try.
You have atelectasis.
You are in danger for pneumothorax pneumonia, R.D.S.
And Meredith Grey is ready to let you slip into a coma.
But I am not! You breathe in through this,
your lungs get stronger, you get better.
It's damn simple math.
What do you wanna do?
This is dumb. Put this on. Put--
No! no!
Just--Richard!
No.
Richard!
Get the hell...
out!
Let's take him off bypass and see how we did.
Everything okay, Dr. Yang?
Pericardial window is a pretty risky move for an intern.
I... I didn't have a choice.
The fluid was too thick for a pericardiocentesis.
You had a choice.
You could have called someone the minute he tamponaded,
but you didn't.
You basically got to do a surgery in the E.R.
And now you're up here with me,
while Edwards is down in the pit.
You're a shark.
I'm not! I swear.
Ross, it's a good thing.
All great surgeons are sharks.
You see what you want and do whatever it takes to get it.
Like me. And never apologize.
Sharks don't apologize.
Monitor.
Here you go.
Where's that coming from?
It's coming from inside. That means we have two options.
One--we can put him back on bypass, undo all our work,
and find the source, or...
two--I take a guess, throw in a u-stitch
and hope I don't shred the heart in the process.
Dr. Ross, what do you think?
Sharks don't swim backward. Only forward... or they die.
Option 2 it is. 4-0 prolene.
Here you go.
There it is.
What's supposed to happen?
If it worked, nothing. If it didn't...
Lots.
That'll do, Sharky. That'll do.
Murphy, those aren't for you.
Yeah, I know.
Have you seen my wife?
Uh, she, uh, hopped on a rig with the paramedics.
Damn it.
Hey, Shepherd?
Shepherd! Wilson, where the hell is Karev?
Question of the night!
You know, I should be at work right now.
You know, Stephanie doesn't realize how lucky she is.
She should be thanking you instead of being pissed at you.
Yeah. Wait, what?
She wanted to come tonight?
She bought a dress.
She never said anything.
Of course not.
If she had to say something, it wouldn't mean as much
as if you'd had the idea on your own.
Oh, my god.
My head hurts so much.
It doesn't matter now.
The party died the minute
the aerialist fell on big bird.
People see a woman's tibia impale her own foot,
it's hard to steer the conversation
in a different direction.
They're gonna be fine.
All right. There's a hospital right down...
down the street.
You know what? Ladies and gentlemen!
Folks, wait a second.
Dr. Bailey?
Dr. Bailey, please?
What do you need?
I haven't played chess in a year.
I can't keep having this fight, Gene.
No, I know. I just...
The guys at the park stopped letting me play.
'cause of the things I say.
I'm not trying to offend you.
That's not true.
I said a couple of those things on purpose.
So... I'm sorry.
You don't have to play the game, but please...
I'm scared.
I don't have anybody.
I don't want to be alone.
What are you doing?
Repairing a gastric rupture. It's fun.
You can't just decide to operate.
Derek, you're better at charming the donors than I am.
I admit it. You can have it.
We had a deal.
You're more than welcome to come and join me.
Come get a little blood on your hands.
I'll even let you hold a retractor.
All right, I'm gonna change.
Oh, this is really, really fun,
and I needed fun.
Me, too.
Yeah.
Can I try on your leg?
You said what?
I was cornered by the widow Amos...
who was, you know, actually a widow.
Her story was so sad,
and she took out her checkbook, and I--
Ugh, I'm so gross.
Yeah.
I sort of get it, though.
Really?
This stuff-- It's not easy.
And Cristina--she keeps pushing me to date.
God, I can't even think about that.
Yeah. You really can't keep telling people that she's dead.
I know.
Doctors, we have visitors.
What is he up to?
I don't know.
Okay, now if you'll notice the pins that Dr. Torres
is drilling into place that is the external fixation
I was telling you about.
Are--are we allowed to be here?
Yes, I spoke with Irina's husband.
He said that if there's one thing that she believes in,
it's that the show must go on.
Now we showed you guys a circus tonight.
But this-- this is the real show.
This is what we do here.
We are gonna get this woman back on her feet.
And then before you leave this evening,
I would ask that you please consider
helping us get back on ours.
How much do you need?
I usually have really good radar for this crap.
What are you talking about?
What the hell is this?
Oh, that's not funny.
Don't freaking joke like that. I don't do that.
I'm just trying to do a freakin' blood draw.
Why?
I think my dad's in the hospital.
I don't understand what that means.
I don't know. I can't--
I haven't seen him in 20 years.
And this guy-- some old junkie--
crashed a car, has no I.D.,
he's ragged, wrecked.
But his voice in the E.R.--
the guy called me Sinatra.
It was like somebody poured ice water down my neck.
That feeling hasn't gone away.
So this is a paternity test?
I don't know.
No.
I thought I could live the rest of my life
and never see him again.
I don't want it to be him.
If you take the test, then you'll know for sure.
If it isn't him, then that feeling will go away.
I guess that's true.
Yeah.
You know, I'm actually pretty smart.
You'd know that if you tried talking to me
instead of ditching me at fancy parties.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Okay.
That surgery was incredible.
I haven't felt this relaxed in months.
Me either.
What?
Reminiscing.
About?
You, me, an exam room,
and your panties pinned to a bulletin board.
The prom.
Except you didn't have blood on your suit,
and I wasn't wearing a sweatshirt.
I think it's sexy.
Now you're doing the sparkly eye thing.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Is it working?
What-- what's this?
You're getting a roommate.
Gene, Richard. Richard, Gene.
Calm down, dick.
The way you look, can't imagine
you're gonna be around much longer anyway.
These are a few options for facilities
that assist with end of life care.
Since you two are in the same boat,
figured you could go through them together.
Crack a window when you go.
Smells like something died in here.
Jake's in the I.C.U. Should pull through.
How are things down here?
You know...
Only amazing.
I cannot believe I was in such a snit
over not going to a stupid party.
I mean, I have done burr holes, a crike,
and I pulled a hunk of glass this big
out of a dude's face!
You were totally right. I am a rock star.
You are a rock star. We are rock stars.
We're not rock stars. We're sharks.
We're rock sharks!
Okay, then.
Jackson!
I heard you were here. I just wanted to,
catch you before you leave.
Here... here I am.
I like the blue.
Thank you.
There are more zeroes than fit in this little box.
Let's get outta here.
To... where?
Come on. Don't be coy.
You like me.
There's no way this was all about the money.
No, it was all about the money.
You flirt with me all night,
get me to write this big check,
and then nothing?
Yeah.
And you don't feel even a little bit bad about that?
No.
That's actually even hotter.
You have a good night.
It doesn't have to be all about money.
You could sleep with me for free.
I have to talk to you.
I don't know what happened.I just...
Stop.
I've been here too many times, honestly.
I'm too old. I'm too busy to be playing games with you.
I'm not playing games.
You're pissed because I didn't invite you to this stupid thing,
and now you're getting back at me with Ross.
That's not true.
Oh, you're not pissed at me?
Yes! I was.
Yeah, I was, okay?
You threw a party, and you didn't invite me.
So yeah, my feelings were hurt a little bit.
But that has nothing to do with what happened in the E.R.
Ross kissed me.
I don't know where it came from.
I did not ask for it.
I swear.
Fine.
Fine?
Yeah... fine.
And this wasn't a party. This was work.
Nobody wanted to come. I never thought you did.
If you and I are gonna do this,
you've gotta start talking to me.
No more getting mad
and then waiting to see if I know you're mad
or any of that.
Yeah, okay.
I didn't want him to kiss me.
I want you to kiss me.
Look at this.
They got a picture of a damned rabbit
hopping through a meadow.
Sunshine and daisies
and friggin' bunny rabbits.
Could be worse.
You could die in that bed...
in this room.
This hospital could be the last place you see.
You don't want to die here.
No. I don't.
It is a pretty lawn.
If I gotta kick,
could be nice to do it outside.
The food's gotta be better than what they serve here.
I wouldn't feed that slop to a gypsy.
I said "I wouldn't." I was being nice.
Are--are you gonna head back up the street?
Uh, no, I was just heading home.
Listen, I don't blame you for not wanting
to get out there and date. People are...
gross.
But we look great. So you wanna go hit Joe's?
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?
You're here?
Yeah, I...
uh, really, uh,
had a good excuse all worked up,
and now I'm completely blanking.
I was just heading home.
It was really nice to meet you.
You, too.
Good night.
Overture, curtain, lights.
I have the results.
This is it...
the night of nights.
I don't wanna know--
He's your dad.
What?
Oh, my god. I jumped the gun.
I am sorry. I am so sorry.
Alex!
Shotgun! I get car sick in the back.
Ugh, I might get car sick in the front.
Thank you.
I'm about to take my intern exam,
which means I am about to be a second-year resident.
My babysitting days are done.
And I would appreciate, if moving forward,
you would treat me with the respect that entails.
You're adorable.
Excuse me.
No more rehearsing and nursing a part.
We know every part by heart.
Ross, what's going on?
Multi-car mash-up in the E.R.
Be a shame to wake the kids.
Tonight, what heights we'll hit.
On with the show.
This is it.
