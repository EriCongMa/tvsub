Well, look who's here?
Ana and I work in the program together.
I got 60 days, clean.
I don't...
Let's just go somewhere and talk, OK?
So she can lie to me again?
We got a letter from Ana.
She wants to see the twins to make amends.
Did she really send you a letter, asking if she could see us?
Yes, she did.
Well, I want to see her.
My dad won't let me sleep
over at your house because he thinks you're gay.
I know you're not. I have to do what he says.
You made it seem like you just
found out so Jesus would miss his team dinner.
That's not true. I was upset...
Yeah, that Emma was going to be there.
I didn't get the principal job.
The woman who got it isn't even really an educator.
She's corporate.
What's going on with you?
Is it Wyatt?
We're kind of taking a break.
You having trouble being with Wyatt?
You've gotta get some help.
We've gotta convince the neighbors
that having us here is actually a good thing.
Hence, Community Day.
Everyone out! Out of the house!
So would you like a drink or anything?
I can... water or iced tea.
I can make you an Arnold Palmer.
No, thanks.
I have to get to work. I was just dropped by
to see how it's going, with Girls United.
Well, it's not really going anywhere.
I mean, no one wants to rent to a group home.
Couldn't you buy a house?
Yeah, if I won the lottery.
Hey, how'd you get my address?
Oh, um, you can pretty much
find out where anyone lives on the Internet.
Well, this is it. What do you think?
I think I'd give you an unacceptable.
So, um, what about the county?
Can't they help you find you a house?
Right now they're threatening to revoke my license.
Why?
Because one of my girls
nearly burned a house while we were in it.
That wasn't your fault.
No, but it's my responsibility.
There was underground stuff going on
that we should have told you about.
Well, you know what? Maybe it's all for the best.
Why do you say that?
I don't know.
I'm tired, Callie.
She can't just give up.
You blame her?
County's always breakin' her balls over things
like loose toilet seats
when other group homes are barely feedin' the kids.
And you know most the girls,
they all about attitude, not gratitude.
What if we, like, organize a fund-raiser?
Like a bake sale? You know how much a house cost?
Too bad one of us doesn't know somebody rich.
I'm not asking Robert for money.
OK. You know, if it wasn't for Sophia,
I'm not even sure we'd have a relationship at all.
What?
Speak of the devil.
Excuse me.
So, I probably should have called.
It's OK.
No, I promised I wouldn't show up, without your mom's knowing.
But I wanted you to hear this from me, first.
She's been here a lot on school nights
We're studying.
Yeah, right.
Brandon gets to rehearse on school nights.
Hey, leave me outta this.
Hayley's going through a hard time,
her parents are getting divorced.
Boy, has she milked that one.
I thought she was your friend.
She is. It's just when it comes to guys
she can be like super needy.
Oh, I'll tell her you said so.
You better not.
Connor can be kinda needy. It's not just girls.
Sorry.
Hey, you got slammed, huh?
Like five minutes before my shift was supposed to end.
Thought we were giving away food.
Let me make your plate.
No, it's OK.
Why can't I get a job?
You can when you're 16.
All right, so I have some news, everyone.
The new principal starts tomorrow.
Have you met her?
Not yet.
It should have been you.
No sour grapes.
I hope she's nice.
She can't be worse than Snatchez.
What did you call her?
Uh, I have some news, too.
Good, I hope.
Robert Quinn has offered to have a fund-raiser
at his house for Girls United.
Wow, that's generous.
So, you asked him for help?
Well, I asked for Rita.
That was a nice thing to do.
Yeah, so it's this Saturday.
Wow, that's fast.
Yeah, Robert thinks they can pull it together.
Can we help?
You know, maybe... do you think the band would play?
Really?
You guys are great.
Yeah. I have to ask everyone.
What can we do?
Just come.
Can I invite Hayley?
No.
It's mostly just gonna be their friends.
We'll, all be there.
And I have some other news, too.
Robert signed the abandonment papers. So I can get adopted.
Talk about burying the lead!
That's great.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, our baby!
That's good news.
*You mean everything to me*
*I give it all away*
*If you say you'll stay*
*True love isn't just a dream*
*So shake me wake me*
*And make it all reality*
So, you know, it's a work in progress.
But it's got that 80's sound you were talking about.
I like it.
It's sweet.
Sweet?
You know me, I'm not really a one true love kinda girl.
It's a little... soft, for me.
I'll re-write it then.
I like the melody.
Yeah, no, the lyrics, so I'll "edge" it up a bit.
We should work on the set for this weekend.
Sorry, I gotta bounce.
But we need to rehearse more.
Well, I can't cancel, I have a date.
I'm free the rest of the week.
Yeah, I'm good. We'll have Jasper, too.
All right.
Later.
What?
Dude.
Lou has a history, with boys in the band.
She blows through them like the wind.
But there's nothing going on.
Yet.
Look, the other guys were no loss
but we've got great chemistry. I don't want any drama.
Me either. Don't worry.
So, like, how many guys?
So, have you guys talked about Ana?
If you're sure you want to see her, we'll arrange it.
She's just gonna cry and say how hard she's tried
but nothing ever works because everyone's against her.
You don't know what she's gonna say.
I know she's the reason that Mom got shot.
And I know she knew it when she showed up at the women's shelter
and acted like she needed my help
when really she just wanted more money for drugs.
OK, well, you don't have to see her.
Don't worry, I'm not.
I'm done. Can I go do my homework?
Yeah, OK, go ahead.
You didn't take out the garbage!
Honey, I know, just...
Fine. I'll do it.
It's hard not to resents Ana.
She got to have her babies and she didn't take care of them.
It's not fair.
I know.
I'm totally unqualifie for this job.
I know that's what you're thinking.
No, I wasn't...
That's what I'd be thinking.
And I'd resent the fact that
they hired someone with a business background
instead of an experienced educator, like youself.
Well, I'm sure they had their reasons.
They think you can run a school like a business.
I think they're wrong. I can make Anchor Beach solvent.
But I can't make it a good school, without you.
I'm giving you complete authority over curriculum.
We'll share administrative tasks
and I'll focus primarily on budget and finance.
I would like to find the funds to
reinstate the music and arts and school club programs.
And athletics.
We don't want to lose students because we don't offer team sports.
Agreed.
Good. We're on the same page.
Oh, hi, Jude, come on in.
This is our new principal, Ms. Porter.
This is my son, Jude.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
And you can call me Monte.
Well, I'm gonna go get settled in.
Great.
Hey, buddy, what's going on?
I need to talk to you about Connor.
So it's gonna be a casual garden party.
We've invited mostly friends.
It's short notice, but we expect a nice turn out.
Well, if there's anything I can do, please let me know.
I think it would nice if you spoke.
Ok.
And Callie, we thought you could introduce her?
Sure.
Maybe you could bring some of the girls,
so they could share their stories with the guests?
Hmm. You know, it would be difficult
to get the girls in juvenile detention sprung for the day.
But actually, Cole and Kiara are in group homes,
so that shouldn't be a problem.
And Daphne.
Oh yeah, Daphne as well.
Uh, there's also something else we need to discuss.
When our friends ask us what our connection is with Girls United,
and with you, Callie, what should we say?
We think it should be up to you. What we tell people.
And whatever you decide is OK with us.
Um... I think, if you could
just tell people we're friends or something.
I can't tell people you're my sister?
Honey, Callie's going to be surrounded by a lot of strangers...
What about when they say how much we look alike?
Everybody always says something.
We smile and thank them for the compliment.
And we respect Callie's privacy.
So, should I come by early Saturday morning to help set up?
Sure.
Why don't you sleep over, Friday night?
Then you'll be here and we can get ready together.
You're welcome, of course.
Yeah, sure. That would be fun.
You think I hit my son in the face?
Is that what you told them?
No.
I was trying to give him a spanking
and he ran away from me, into a door jam.
That's what I said.
OK, so why am I here?
Connor, would you mind stepping out so we can talk to your dad?
Mr. Stevens, do you think it's appropriate
to spank a thirteen year old boy?
I think it's none of your damn business.
And quite frankly, this is all your fault.
My fault?
Yeah.
You were the chaperone on the seventh grade camping trip,
and allowed our sons to spend the night in a tent together
without my permission.
Why is that a problem?
Because her son is gay.
Which I have no problem with...
Clearly you do...
Really? Would you allow a boy and
a girl to share a tent? No. You wouldn't.
My son has not defined his sexuality in any way.
The point is, Connor knows the rules.
Whose rules?
Mine, my rules, for my son.
And he violated them, OK? And I punished him.
Do you know the definition of bullying?
Connor doesn't bully your son.
Making threats, spreading rumors,
attacking someone physically or verbally
or excluding someone from a group on purpose.
Connor stands up for Jude.
I'm not talking about Connor.
I'm talking about you. You are the bully.
I told him his dad would be angry if we shared a tent.
I'm partly to blame. I...
I knew he didn't want Connor spending the night here,
but I guess...
I just think he's wrong and ridiculous.
Maybe we shouldn't be friends.
No, that is not the answer.
So, do you think it's true, that he didn't hit Connor?
I don't think he hit him in the face.
Look, I don't want you to worry.
Ok?
I'm dealing with this.
OK, go up and do your homework.
Maybe they shouldn't be friends.
What? Why would you say that?
There are other kids in his grade
who have parents who are progressive and kind.
So the bully wins and Connor suffers.
He's already suffering.
And maybe trying to educate his dad is just making things worse.
Well, sometimes it's my job
to educate the parents as well as the kids.
And he's practically the only friend that Jude has.
Yeah, which isn't great. Jude needs more friends.
When have you ever backed down from a fight?
Let's say this was another kid at school.
What would you tell his parents?
That if we didn't stand up to bullies and try to educate people
we wouldn't have civil rights and marriage equality.
OK. How's the new principal?
More supportive than you.
I'm in here!
I just need to grab some nail polish.
Nice look.
Take the nail polish and get out.
Hmm, what do you think? Cherry red or mint green?
I don't care. Take them all.
Seriously, what is with that towel?
On my God! Moms are going to kill you!
Not if you don't tell them.
Oh, I'm telling them.
No. No! No! No! No! No!
What do you want, huh?
What do you want to keep your mouth shut?
I know you want something.
Hey. Uh, come on in.
Considering what's happened, I'd like to be present.
It's fine.
I'll be in the other room.
OK, sit down.
You changed your hair.
Oh, uh, yeah.
It nice.
So, Stef, I want to thank you and Lena
for allowing me to do this.
It was their choice.
Well, thank you.
I don't really know exactly where to start.
I, um...
I... I made an inventory.
It's what they call it in AA.
It's basically just a list of all the terrible things I did to you
and ways I let you down when you were little and recently.
It's long.
It's too long.
I think what I...
...what I really want to say...
...what I'm most ashamed of...
...is that I loved getting high more than I loved you.
And it wasn't because you weren't lovable.
You were beautiful children
who just got a really raw deal with me as your mother.
I'm just so grateful that God found you two great moms
who could love you and take care of you the way I should have.
What we do in these cases is to write a letter to the district
as well as the State Department of Education.
For students engaged in bullying. We're talking about a parent.
Who is spreading rumors and participating in exclusion.
We don't know that he's told anyone but his son and...
Me, in your presence...
That he believes Jude is gay.
He didn't say "believes." He said "is."
He also said he doesn't have a problem with it.
He won't allow his son to share a tent with Jude
during a school supervised trip.
But they weren't supervised, in the tent.
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting anything.
None of the boys or girls were supervised in their tents.
And Jude has not said he's gay.
And no one has the right to label anyone.
I agree. And we don't have the right to label the parent as a bully
because he has rules about who he allows his son to socialize with
and under what conditions.
I disagree.
As a parent you have that right.
But as Vice Principal of this school it's a conflict of interest
for you to use your position to retaliate.
Retaliate?
That's how it could be construed.
And we can't afford to get sued.
How about I just use my position as a parent then?
You should have asked me what happened.
I did. You wouldn't talk about it.
I didn't want to tell you that my dad still...
...spanks me.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I know what it's like to get hit
and feel like you can't tell anyone.
You didn't tell your mom what we did?
Did you?
No.
So is there anything you want to say to me?
It's OK, you can tell me how you feel.
You can be honest.
Mariana?
I know you, I know you must have something you want to say to me.
You don't know me. You don't know anything about me.
You want me to be honest? I feel nothing.
I look at you and you're nothing.
You're just a very sad stranger.
I'm done. I'll wait outside.
Don't cry.
She didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Don't do that.
What?
Don't try to take care of me. You always used to do that.
No matter how long I left you alone,
to go get high...
Mariana, she would always get angry with me but you...
You would never stay mad at me,
'cause I'd cry
and you'd try to make me feel better.
That was not your job then and it's not your job now.
You OK?
You told me DNA doesn't make a family.
It doesn't.
Then why did you want a baby?
I... I wanted...
A real daughter.
Honey, you are my real daughter.
But I'll always be adopted.
And Ana will always be my birth mother.
I hate that I come from her.
Why couldn't I come from you?
Oh, my baby.
I wish with all my heart that I could have carried you inside me.
Sometimes I...
...I feel guilty that I wasn't
there for you from the moment you were born.
But I realized something
when I lost Frankie?
Was that you only carry a baby in your belly for nine months.
But you carry your child in your heart forever.
That's the only place that it counts.
You do come from me.
And from Mom.
And giving birth to you,
that wouldn't have made me love you any more than I do.
Are you sure?
Would it make you love me more?
No. That's crazy.
Ok.
So, how about we both stop acting crazy, huh?
Come here.
I love you.
I love you.
Will you help me with something tomorrow?
Anything.
Hi. How is she?
She's fine.
How are you?
I quit my job today.
*You mean absolutely nothing to me*
*You are just like the boys before and yet they will be more*
*Your heart stops but I am a super nova*
*take in, break in and burn in up the galaxy*
You're an ass.
I re-wrote it so, you know, you could relate to it.
And this is who you think I am?
It's kinda how you advertise.
Did Mat tell you I have a history of screwing guys in the band?
He just said to be careful.
Because I'm a cold-hearted bitch.
Because I don't believe in Prince Charming or happily ever after
or "I can't live without you."
I think...
You know what Mat didn't mention
was that one of those guys turned out to be a coke head
and the other one was a crazy jealous freak.
He just doesn't want anything to happen.
Well, neither do you. So what's the issue?
I really like Sia.
and fall in an apple, like Llewyn Davis
Do you listen to them?
Yeah, kinda. They're sort of depressing.
I like music that's about something.
Is Brandon's band good?
Yeah, they're awesome.
So, like the guy you told me about, before Wyatt,
The one you loved, was it Brandon?
Why do you say that?
Your eyes light up when you talk about him.
Well, that's because he's my best friend.
And my brother, soon.
You know, Robert signed the papers?
What about Wyatt?
I don't know about Wyatt right now.
Did you guys break up?
I'm not sure.
Why do you call our dad Robert?
I guess, because Donald is my dad.
Is it true?
He killed your mom in a car accident?
Well, he was driving.
And he went to jail?
He was drinking, so, yeah. But he's out now.
So why aren't you and Jude with him?
You know, he's just... He can't take care of us.
Our dad can take care of you.
I'm getting adopted by Lena and Stef.
Will we still be friends?
Of course, yeah.
We'll always be sisters.
We should probably get some sleep.
You should probably know, the guest room,
it's haunted.
I'm kidding.
But if you want, you can sleep in here.
Ok.
But sometimes, I wake up and see this woman
standing at the end of my bed.
Stop it!
Where did you get these?
Rita told me about the pictures you took
of some of the girls, that helped them get foster families.
And, you know, these are really great photos.
You're talented.
Thank you.
And for doing this. It means a lot.
Hello?
Oh, wow, this is beautiful.
Oh, my gosh, it's only been one night, but we missed you.
I missed you, too.
Oh, my gosh, your hair is back.
Well, it was never really gone.
No, I missed brunette Mariana.
Yeah, I did too.
You just wanted to be the only blonde in the house.
You watch it.
So, Rita and the girls are downstairs
by the pool where everything's kind of happening.
They have a pool? Can I live here?
Hey hey, what's so important?
Hayley's sort of freaking out.
Oh. Why?
She wanted me to blow this off today to take care of her.
I gotta take care of myself sometimes, you know?
Yeah, I do know.
It was so good to meet you.
I wouldn't mind living here.
We'll be lucky to still
live where we do now that you quit your job.
You must be Lena. I'm Jill.
Hi. It's nice to finally meet you both.
I'm Robert. Thanks for coming.
Well, thank you for what you're doing for Callie and for Girls United.
It's our pleasure.
And, uh, thank you, for signing the papers.
Of course. I just want Callie to be happy.
Well, we love her very much.
Yes, I can see that.
How soon do you think before you can adopt her?
Well, we have to get a court date, but a couple weeks, probably.
Well, it looks like most everyone's here.
Yes, uh, let's get this party started.
Let's do it.
Could I have everyone's attention, please?
Thank you all for coming, on such short notice.
I guess now we know who our real friends are.
Jill and I, we recently
heard about Girls United through a friend.
And we were very impressed
by what this group home does for at-risk girls,
providing a safe and...
You know, you look a lot like a girl I know.
Really?
Unfortunately, they had
a fire recently and they lost their house.
And that's really why we're here today, it's to help raise money
so that they can get a new home.
She's a blonde.
Who is?
The girl you look like.
Is she pretty?
Not as pretty as you.
But I've always been into brunettes.
...enjoy Someone's Little Sister.
One, two, three...
They're really good.
Yeah.
Listen, thanks, for all this,
for what you did for, well, for not only Girls United
but for having my back, for not letting me give up.
It's really Robert we should thank.
But I know it wasn't easy for you, to ask him to do this.
Oh, he signed the papers. So I can get adopted.
That's great.
And he's not making me sign the, uh,
liability waiver, whatever.
Right, yeah.
So he said that he trusts that i don't want anything from him.
And why? Why don't you want anything from him?
Like money?
No.
Like a relationship.
I mean, it's quite obvious, Callie, he loves you.
He barely knows me.
Oh, now come on.
It doesn't take very long to love you, Callie.
You're pretty amazing, you are.
You're kind, you've got a compassionate heart.
And besides, you're his daughter.
So.
So he never had the chance to be a father to you and,
I mean, it's pretty clear that he wants to be.
If you'll let him.
I just... I really can't figure out why you wouldn't.
I'm just saying that maybe it's
not too late to get back the job you have and love.
And what about Jude? Who fights for him?
I do. It's not a conflict of interest for me to write a letter.
Frankly, I think that there's some grey area here, Lena.
So you agree with Monte?
I'm not saying that...
Hey. I didn't know you were coming.
Yeah, I wanted to make a donation.
Oh, that's nice.
You should check out the silent auction.
Yeah?
But don't you dare outbid me on that trip to Puerto Rico.
Like that's gonna happen.
Excuse me. I need something to drink.
So, how are the kids? After meeting with Ana?
They're OK. They're OK.
At the moment, I'm a little bit more concerned about my wife.
Why? What's going on?
She quit her job.
What? Why?
Not for the reason that she thinks.
In my opinion, I think she lost the principal job and the baby.
And she wants control over something and sometimes...
The only control you have is to quit.
Thank you. Thanks for listening.
Uh, we're gonna go ahead and turn it over to the people
you really came to hear from. Callie?
Hi. My name's Callie.
And I... I was at Girls United.
At first, I didn't think I belonged there, no one does.
But Rita, the amazing woman that runs the whole thing,
she... she doesn't let
you get away with your... bad word deleted.
Not because she's a hard ass, which she is,
but because she cares.
She really cares about every girl that walks through her door.
And it's because of her and the other girls
and my wonderful brother and foster family,
that I finally believed I could have faith in my future.
Rita, you are the heart and soul of Girls United.
You work tirelessly for not much money
and not a lot of gratitude.
But thank you for not giving up.
You've given me the courage
to embrace everything that I am.
And to not be afraid of accepting love.
So I want to acknowledge Robert Quinn...
for not only being a really nice guy
but for being my father.
It's a long story.
We only really found out about each other recently.
But I'm really grateful to have him in my life now.
So thank you, Robert and thank you Jill
and my sister, Sophia
for being so kind to me.
And now, Rita?
Hi, everyone, I'm Rita Hendricks.
I met most of you at this amazing event.
I really don't know what to say.
We thought Girls United was over but, I don't know,
love can move mountains, make miracles
and maybe just get us a new house.
I'll never forget this night and, um...
...we all thank you, very much.
Come here.
OK. OK. What'd you have to tell me?
It's not too late!
What's not?
For us to be a family.
Sophia, I'm getting adopted by the Fosters.
Dad didn't sign the papers.
I mean, he did but they didn't actually ever get sent
because I took them out of the mail and I ripped them up.
So are you OK?
That Callie acknowledged Robert and Sophia?
Yeah. Are you?
I think so.
Yeah.
Did you quit your job because of me?
How did you know about that?
I overheard. Sorry.
Is it my fault?
No.
No.
No, I quit my job because someone has to stand up to bullying.
I'm your mom first, and I care more
about defending you than I do about keeping my job.
You shouldn't, defend me.
Why not?
Because we did do something on the camping trip that was...
...wrong, I guess.
Dad, please listen, OK, I just thought
if she had more time that she would see we're a family.
The Fosters are my family.
You just told everyone we are.
Sophia, let me talk to Callie alone, OK?
I'm trying not to be mad at her.
I think she's just...
Gotten attached to you.
Yeah, we all have.
So how long do you think until you can get new copies?
I can't.
I can't sign the papers, again.
Signing them the first time,
was the hardest thing that I have ever done.
And after hearing you today, say that... I'm your father...
I can't abandon you. I know it's what you want.
I love you.
I don't love you.
And I will never live in this house with you.
And I will never call you my father again.
Wait, Callie...
No, you promised me!
I know. I do, I want you to be happy.
I won't be happy. I'm never going to be happy.
I'm so sorry, OK? I just want you to be with us.
I'm your sister.
No, you're not. You're a spoiled little brat.
Hey, Callie? What's going on?
Robert's not letting me get adopted.
I thought he signed the papers?
I can't believe how stupid I am.
I knew I couldn't trust him. I can't trust anything.
And I knew this was gonna happen, Brandon, I knew it.
Come here, come here, sit down with me.
Take some breaths. OK, just take some deep breaths.
No matter what, they can't make you live with them.
We'll still be your family.
I'm never getting adopted.
You don't know that.
Yes I do.
If Robert doesn't sign the papers.
Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be,
maybe this is the way it was always supposed to be.
I gave up so much to be adopted.
