猫王进入倒计时 别扭大菜
oh , hey , if you guys are free this weekend ,
i won a night of wine tasting from work .
that sounds fun .
how come scientists don &apos;t win free stuff like salespeople do ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re not in it for the stuff .
we &apos;re in it for the groupies .
personally ,
i find the notion of external rewards demeaning .
i pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery .
but you always say that you want to win a nobel prize .
i also say don &apos;t contradict me in front of my friends ,
but that you don &apos;t remember .
all right , well , let me know if you guys want to go .
i would love to .
i do enjoy the complexity of an aged pinot noir .
i &apos;m sure that would pair nicely
with your fried nuggets of chicken .
well , it sounds like a nice night . we should go .
wine again ?
yeah , no , thank you .
i like my grapes the old @-@ fashioned way :
in a juice box .
well , i &apos;m going .
you couldn &apos;t stop me from getting a massage at the mall ,
and you &apos;re not stopping me now .
i shouldn &apos;t have to see my girlfriend
get groped in public by another man .
and i shouldn &apos;t have to see my boyfriend
riding on a train for children around the mall .
the little choo @-@ choo for toddlers ?
and now you know why i needed the massage .
well , we &apos;re out .
bernie can &apos;t drink &apos; cause she &apos;s pregnant .
and she &apos;s pregnant because we had sex .
and we had sex because ...
well , come on .
it &apos;s okay . you should go .
you sure ?
of course .
yeah , give her a break from , &quot; well , come on . &quot;
well , bernadette , looks like saturday night , it &apos;s you and me .
me ? how ? why ?
well , it makes perfect sense .
because you &apos;re an expectant mother , you can &apos;t drink alcohol .
i don &apos;t like to .
you can &apos;t have sushi .
i don &apos;t like to .
you can &apos;t go in hot tubs .
i consider them vats of sweaty people soup .
gee , sheldon , i don &apos;t know .
oh , come on .
roller coasters , caffeine , runny eggs--
i &apos;ve been avoiding these things all my life .
and now , because you &apos;re pregnant , you have to .
the difference is she &apos;s bringing life into the world ,
and you suck it out .
i guess we could give it a try .
well , little lady , you &apos;ve heard of party hearty ;
get ready to party hardly .
i bet you &apos;d like a drink right now .
hey , you think it &apos;d be okay
if i brought claire to the wine tasting ?
sure . i &apos;d like to meet her .
oh , that &apos;s great .
i &apos;ve been wanting her to meet you guys , too ,
so this seems like the perfect opportunity .
oh , but i won &apos;t be there .
funny how that worked out .
does this mean emily &apos;s not in the picture anymore ?
no , i &apos;m still dating her .
okay , help me out .
how are you doing this ?
do they know about each other ?
they know that we &apos;re not exclusive ,
and we just don &apos;t ask too many questions .
you know , it &apos;s like how i play warlords of ka &apos;a with you
and elder sign with frank and alicia .
who &apos;s frank and alicia ?
y ... you and i spend a lot of time together .
can there be a little mystery between us ?
okay .
everything &apos;s hooked up . we &apos;re ready .
i am going to record this for posterity .
all right , here goes nothing .
here goes nothing ?
this is the initial test of our prototype .
can we give it a little more gravitas ?
fine .
preliminary trial of the infinite persistence
gyroscopic navigational system : phase one commencing .
eh ... maybe it &apos;s your voice .
i &apos;m gonna see if i can get james earl jones to do it in post .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s beautiful .
actually , it &apos;s making me dizzy .
good , it &apos;s not just me .
hello .
hey , claire .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
hi , yeah .
um , i was wondering ,
if you &apos;re free saturday night ,
all my friends are going to a wine tasting .
sure , i guess .
if you don &apos;t think meeting your friends is too big a step .
why would it be too big a step ?
i don &apos;t know . i just don &apos;t want things to get weird .
nothing to worry about .
people meet people all the time ,
and it isn &apos;t weird .
i met bon jovi once , which you &apos;d think might be weird .
turns out , total sweetheart .
okay , but you and i have been keeping things casual .
uh , will you introduce me as your friend
or as your girlfriend ?
what if i like them
and they don &apos;t like me ?
what if they like me and i don &apos;t like them ?
boy , it wasn &apos;t this hard with bon jovi .
i said , &quot; you rock , &quot; he said , &quot; thanks , man , &quot;
and that was that .
hey , you ready to go ?
hang on .
what are you doing ?
oh , i found a scratch @-@ and @-@ sniff book about wine tasting .
作者是侍酒大师理查德 · 贝茨 书后配有一张酒香轮盘
it teaches the different flavor notes to look for .
you actually smell the wine ?
i mostly just smell my nasal spray .
are your sinuses acting up ?
since my preschool got a bunny .
hey , are you still hanging out with bernadette tonight ?
yes .
and we &apos;re going to prove that we don &apos;t need alcohol
to enjoy ourselves .
oh , good for you .
or caffeine , tobacco , sushi ,
soft cheese , processed meats and jacuzzis ,
which can all be harmful to an unborn baby .
no honeybaked ham in a hot tub-- got it .
oh , no bubble baths either .
they can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection .
okay , have fun .
oh , and no swordfish , king mackerel , shark or tilefish ,
which are all high in mercury .
we &apos;re leaving now !
oh , and no contact with guinea pigs
or hamsters or their droppings ,
uh , no @-@ no cat litter boxes , no paint fumes ...
okay , we &apos;re leaving , love you , bye !
boy , do i love restrictions .
where is everybody ?
oh , we &apos;re the first ones here .
cool .
yeah .
cool .
you know , i don &apos;t remember the last time
it was just you and me hanging out .
oh , i do . it was three years ago .
oh , yeah , and we said we should do it more often .
and @-@ and here we are .
so , sheldon and bernadette are hanging out .
i know . what are they gonna talk about ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really don &apos;t know .
oh , good !
oh , thank god !
you guys been here long ?
no , two minutes .
but yes .
where &apos;s claire ?
oh , she &apos;s meeting us here .
hey , guys , do me a favor
and don &apos;t ask too many questions about the relationship .
we &apos;re just keeping it casual .
oh , so i shouldn &apos;t ask her how she feels about being
a member of your harem ?
yeah , i know you &apos;re teasing , but watch out for karma .
hey , penny , isn &apos;t that your old boyfriend zack ?
oh , yeah .
are you gonna say hi to him ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
hey , while you decide ,
who was better in bed :
big hot zack or wheezy little leonard ?
neener neener .
i brought sparkling cider .
oh ... the bubbles tickle my nose .
i &apos;ll just open this now
so it can get nice and flat before we drink it .
so what do you want to do tonight ?
oh , i have quite the evening planned .
our fetus @-@ friendly festival of fun begins
with an in @-@ depth look at the world of model trains ,
and then we &apos;ll kick things up a notch and explore
all the different ways that you can make toast .
there &apos;s more than one ?
you &apos;ve heard of french toast ?
yeah .
cinnamon toast ?
yeah .
melba toast ?
yeah .
you get where i &apos;m going here ?
yeah .
i &apos;m getting an earthy note .
ah , there &apos;s definitely some oak .
also , uh , cherries ?
i smell nothing .
really ? nothing ?
just a ... whole lot of afrin .
penny ?
oh . zack , hi !
you guys remember zack .
yeah , hey , buddy .
hello .
hey , did you two get married ?
we did .
yeah , mm @-@ hmm .
to each other ?
yes .
cool . &apos; cause other than when you broke up with him
and dated me , then broke up with me ,
and then dated me one more time
before going back to him ,
i was always rooting for you two .
thanks .
so how &apos;s the science world ?
what are you guys up to ?
w @-@ we &apos;ve actually been working on a prototype
for a navigation system we invented .
but we won &apos;t bore you with the details .
are you kidding ? i love science .
einstein , stephen hawking ,
奈尔 · 德葛拉司 · 泰森是以从事科学传播闻名的美国天文学家
mike degrasse tyson .
mike degrasse tyson ?
yeah , you know , the boxer who grew a mustache
and became a scientist .
so what &apos;s your invention ?
well , we &apos;re using quantum vortices
to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems .
what &apos;s neat is that they can maintain
angular momentum indefinitely .
angular momentum .
i was wondering about that .
you could put it in a satellite or a rocket ,
and it &apos;ll run forever .
cool .
could it be used for missiles and war stuff ?
yeah , but we didn &apos;t create it for weapons .
and i doubt the military would be interested
in our little guidance system .
is it better than the one they use now ?
a lot !
way better .
you sure you guys are smart ?
&quot; h @-@ o &quot; gauge trains are 1 / 87 scale .
&quot; n &quot; gauge are 1 / 160 scale .
and that brings us to &quot; z &quot; gauge , at a
&quot; you could easily swallow it , don &apos;t ask how i know , &quot;
1 / 220 .
i &apos;m sorry , i have to ask .
when i was five , i ingested a &quot; z &quot; gauge locomotive .
i spent the next three days saying , &quot; i think i can pass it ,
i think i can pass it , i think i can pass it . &quot;
what is it about trains that you like so much ?
what an interesting question .
when i was a child , life was confusing
and chaotic for me , and trains represented order .
i could line them up , categorize them , control them .
i guess you could say that
they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s lovely , sheldon .
well ... other than when they &apos;re chugging through your bowels ,
these things are magic .
i have to admit , i &apos;ve been worried about
the military applications since we started talking about this .
me , too .
why didn &apos;t you say something ?
same reason i don &apos;t talk about ass cancer .
it &apos;s not a pleasant topic .
you can &apos;t let this stop you .
almost any scientific advancement can be used
for destructive purposes .
it &apos;s true . even einstein &apos;s theory of relativity
was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons .
e equals mc squared .
yeah .
&quot; e &quot; is for energy , &quot; m &quot; for mass ,
and &quot; c &quot; for the speed of light .
how do you know that ?
oh , leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer .
hey , raj .
hey , claire . good , you &apos;re here .
guys , this is my friend claire .
we &apos;re casually dating , and there &apos;s no need
for any further questions about it .
would you like a glass of wine ?
i said no questions !
and last but not least ,
this is one that i like to call star wars toast because ...
it has a light side and a dark side .
all righty , it &apos;s time for dungeons &amp; dragons !
dungeons &amp; dragons .
that sounds about right .
you &apos;re gonna enjoy this .
i designed it especially for you .
okay , but just for a little bit .
oh , i have a feeling that once you start ,
you &apos;re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop .
all right .
ready ?
you bet .
your name is bernatrix .
you are a warrior queen .
you &apos;re strong , beautiful and tall .
i like the idea of being tall .
i think you &apos;re gonna like a lot of things i have in store .
for example , in this world , only the men get pregnant ,
so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs .
this is getting fun . what &apos;s next ?
you &apos;re parched and weary from battle .
you stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest ,
most delicious ale in all the realm .
oh , i haven &apos;t had a drink in months .
what do you do ?
i storm in , slam my sword down ,
and say , &quot; barkeep , bring me the strongest ale you have
and serve it in the skull of a goblin ! &quot;
he wants to see i.d.
so , claire , we &apos;ve heard so many wonderful things about you .
really ? like what ?
uh , mostly penny &apos;s heard them .
boy , you get some dirty looks over there
when you ask for ice .
zack , this is my friend claire .
you &apos;re hot . you seeing anybody ?
uh , she &apos;s seeing me .
why &apos;d you say she &apos;s your friend ?
we &apos;re just keeping it casual .
why is he being casual with you ? you seem great .
i don &apos;t know . ask him .
why are you being casual with her ? she seems great .
maybe we should take a step back .
take a step back ?
i &apos;m not a young man anymore .
no , i mean reevaluate what we &apos;re doing with the guidance system .
but i got a baby on the way .
i got to make some money .
what good is money gonna do
if we inadvertently bring about armageddon ?
okay , let me stop you right there .
we absolutely know our invention
will not be used to destroy the world .
how ?
because no one from the future
has come back to kill us .
very funny .
you got something better ?
well , not really .
okay , then .
geez , how much wine did you drink ?
not a lot .
i just couldn &apos;t start until you walked away .
the hell prawn lunges out of the hot spring !
you block it with your shield .
do you attack ?
does it have eyes ?
three giant red ones and they never blink .
it &apos;s unsettling .
i stab it in the middle eye !
good choice !
critical hit ! your sword goes
through its eye into its tiny brain .
with its final dying gasp , it says ,
&quot; you have reduced me to a pile of sushi .
enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce .
it &apos;s low sodium . &quot;
okay , i guess i should eat the hell prawn .
using your sword ,
you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner .
you slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water
on your aching joints .
as you happily close your eyes ,
you recall the incredible evening you &apos;ve had
and notice that your ...
... feet and ankles are smaller than they &apos;ve ever been .
the end .
wow , this night turned out to be so much more fun than i thought .
oh , the fun doesn &apos;t stop .
you &apos;re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast .
thank you for this .
you know , ever since people found out i &apos;m having a baby ,
i feel like i became pregnant bernadette .
it was nice to take a little break tonight .
i can understand that .
from the moment people realized i was a genius ,
i &apos;ve been sheldon the genius .
although i &apos;ve never really wanted a break from that ,
so i suppose i don &apos;t understand .
which is ironic
&apos;cause , you know , genius .
well , thanks again .
you &apos;re welcome .
and any time you need a break from being bernadette the pregnant ,
bernatrix the warrior queen is here waiting .
i might just take you up on that .
well , mind you now ,
that offer &apos;s only good until the third trimester .
i can &apos;t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot .
hey , dude , you &apos;re killing me with claire .
what are you talking about ?
i mean , come on , look at you .
you &apos;re classically handsome ,
you &apos;ve got a swimmer &apos;s body .
next to you , i look like me .
oh , man , i didn &apos;t mean to do that .
but i do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer &apos;s body .
which , incidentally ,
一个人当鬼蒙上眼睛去抓其他人
i got from playing marco polo at the ymca .
yeah , okay , just ... do me a favor
and stop talking about how great claire is .
anything for you , my little foreign friend .
so , i got to ask ,
does raj bring around other girls ?
uh , you know ,
i @-@ i &apos;m not really around that much .
amy knows much more than i do .
i don &apos;t think you have anything to worry about .
raj is a terrific guy , loyal to a fault .
yeah . he still has an aol address .
i see what you &apos;re saying .
she &apos;s not so great .
don &apos;t listen to him .
he says crazy things all the time .
uh , watch . marco .
polo !
让鬼由声音来判断其他人躲在哪里
so , uh , what are you guys talking about ?
your friends were just telling me about
all the other girls you &apos;re dating .
why would you do that ?
i specifically asked you not to do that .
we didn &apos;t .
you just did .
maybe none of you guys are smart .
morning .
morning .
ugh . too much wine .
oh , i overdid it myself last night .
hair of the dog .
又被称为喝 &quot; 回魂酒 &quot;
hey , did you ever think about the military applications
for the guidance system ?
of course .
does it bother you ?
no , it did at first ,
but then i talked it through with frank and alicia , and ...
... they really helped put things into perspective .
who are these people ?
leonard , friends are like toilet paper .
it &apos;s good to have extras under the sink .
