jeff . jeff ?
oh , sorry . uh , what was the question ?
what are we gonna do without pierce
in the study group this year ?
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll figure it out .
speaking of figuring things out ,
me and abed have an announcement .
troy and i are living together .
oh , that &apos;s-- - oh , that &apos;s nice .
if you want to get us a gift ,
we &apos;re registered at linens &apos; n things .
we have plenty of linens . we mainly want the things .
how you like me now , bitches ?
dean , you seem different .
are you in a play right now ?
over the summer , i decided it &apos;s time
to whip this place into shape .
i &apos;m gonna be a mean , lean , deaning machine .
no more paintball , no more spaceships ,
no more trampolines , and no more--
what is that ?
it &apos;s probably the monkey that lives in the vents .
i named him &quot; annie &apos;s boobs , &quot; after annie &apos;s boobs .
see , this is the kind of national lampoonery
that is coming to an end this year .
homie don &apos;t dean this .
okay , guys , let &apos;s get to biology on time .
i don &apos;t want to be a screwup this year .
uh , britta .
damn it .
we &apos;re really doing this without pierce ?
so sad .
yeah , we have parted ways with our closest ,
oldest , craziest , most racist , oldest ,
elderly , crazy friend ,
and he &apos;s not coming back .
i &apos;m back .
how was your summer ?
enlightful , annie .
i underwent three months of intensive soul @-@ rezoning
at the laser lotus celebrity center .
i stand before you a more highly evolved pierce pawthorne ,
one that can accept that this table has a--
has a sort of magic in it .
and i &apos;d like to come back .
yeah .
damn it !
oh , uh , sorry .
i just had the frustrating realization
that you can &apos;t come back to the group ,
because you &apos;re not in biology and it &apos;s all filled up .
well , couldn &apos;t we take something else ?
i mean , surely we &apos;ve evolved beyond
caring what class we take together .
oh , yeah .
pierce !
i &apos;ll do you one better .
i think we &apos;ve evolved beyond reliance on a group at all .
aren &apos;t we just actual friends now , no matter where we are ?
you know what &apos;s magic about this table ?
it magically keeps our books from falling on the floor .
the table &apos;s for studying , but as friends , we &apos;ve evolved .
and let &apos;s use that first breath
of crisp , new , super evolved air
to declare proudly and in one voice , &quot; pierce ...
we &apos;ll see you when we see you . &quot;
don &apos;t tell the monkey i &apos;m living here .
oh , star @-@ burns , i see you added a lizard
to your special hat and sideburns .
am i missing anything ?
yeah ! the human being underneath it all ,
but no one &apos;s really interested in that , are they ?
no .
i hope we did the right thing about pierce .
he really seems like he &apos;s changed .
what are you , nuts ?
that &apos;s what he wants you to think .
trust me , we &apos;re better off without him .
excluding pierce is what drove him crazy last year .
wrong , being crazy drove him excluded .
what &apos;s wrong ?
cougar town has been moved to mid @-@ season .
that &apos;s never a good sign .
not cool , not cool , not cool , not cool , not cool--
hey buddy , hey , it &apos;s coming back in january .
six seasons and a movie .
six seasons and a movie .
this is intro to biology .
i &apos;m your professor , dr. marshall king , phd .
it took me 6,205 hours to get my degree ,
and i know , because i was only allowed in the library
one hour per day at the san vicente correctional facility
while serving a sentence of 25 to life .
now let &apos;s talk about that word .
&quot; life . &quot;
sorry .
it &apos;s a new phone . switching to vibrate .
continue . this is really great .
i stared at a crack in the ground in my cell for years ,
and one day , something grew from it .
a single blade of grass .
vibrates louder than the ringer .
gosh . you know what ? turning it off .
living thing , growing from dead stone .
get out !
oh , it &apos;s off , it &apos;s off .
out !
i turned it off .
fine . okay , fine . i &apos;m leaving .
and don &apos;t bother coming back .
seriously ? hey , dude ,
sean penn called . he says to dial it back .
sean penn is an actor who--
i know who sean penn is . i &apos;ve seen milk .
now get out .
dude , learn to blend .
i will not tolerate monkeys living on campus .
if i wanted to run a monkey hotel ,
i &apos;d install a banana buffet .
i &apos;d use vines as elevators ,
and i &apos;d put tail holes in the bathrobes ,
and i &apos;d lower all the shower knobs .
wow , you &apos;ve really thought this through .
and now it &apos;s your turn . brainstorm .
idea shower .
spray your solutions all over me .
well , w @-@ we could seal all the vents
and then pump the ducts with some kind of gas
that knocks out monkeys .
monkey knockout gas !
now that &apos;s the kind of grounded ,
sensible thinking i want to see this year .
catherine , who &apos;s next ?
vice dean laybourne
from the air conditioning repair school annex .
vice dean . dean .
new suit , dean ?
new dean , vice dean . new dean .
i see that you used school funds
to buy an espresso machine for your faculty break room .
i don &apos;t recall being consulted on that .
i don &apos;t consult you on anything .
that &apos;s the problem .
the air @-@ conditioning repair school annex seems to think
that it &apos;s separate from greendale ,
but it &apos;s an annex .
an appendage , on a body , with a head ,
and this head is saying to this appendage ,
&quot; whazup ? &quot;
what you say makes sense , dean .
tell you what .
you bring your head down to my appendage tomorrow ,
and i &apos;ll show you &quot; whazup . &quot;
i &apos;ll be there .
i think i found something that will help abed !
abed , did you know that cougar town
is an american adaptation of a 1990s british sitcom ?
cougarton abbey .
just been &apos; round cougarton chapel .
i may be having an awakening .
come off it , deidre .
you &apos;ve only been having a butchers at the choir boys .
better than nothing . thanks , britta .
can you believe that guy ,
kicking me out of class like that ?
it &apos;s gonna be impossible to find a science class
with six open spots .
why would we need to do that ?
because i &apos;m not in biology anymore .
and neither is pierce ,
but you &apos;re both still our friends .
we &apos;ve evolved .
right , jeff ?
yes , we have .
and we all love each other .
and we all go to the same school , so , uh ...
i guess i &apos;ll see ya when i see ya .
hey , guess what .
i was on the wait list for biology ,
somebody got kicked out , i am--
here to study !
all hail , sir eats alone .
shut up , leonard .
i heard about your prescription socks .
hope you don &apos;t mind , jeff ,
but i &apos;ve got a new favorite show ,
and i &apos;m only on episode six .
you guys got about five minutes left to eat .
oh , my , time flies when you &apos;re studying the science of life .
well , i think time flies when you &apos;re joking around
about movie titles that sound like names for poops .
remains of the day .
wait a second .
were you eavesdropping on our study session ?
i was eavesdropping on your goof @-@ off session ,
and you dummies missed the most obvious one .
no , i said , &quot; green mile . &quot;
operation dumbo drop !
ew !
gross !
too clever by half , jeffrey .
all right , well uh , i gotta go .
thanks for the five minutes .
aw , jeffrey .
blimey . the barrister &apos;s foreclosed the abbey .
fancy a drink , then ?
oi , fetch us a hemlock .
um--
britta ?
why did everyone on cougarton abbey just die ?
they only ran six episodes .
that &apos;s the great thing about british tv .
they give you closure .
no , no , no !
we &apos;ll find you a new favorite show !
we &apos;ll find you a new favorite show !
come on , buddy .
you are human tennis elbow .
you are a pizza burn on the roof of the world &apos;s mouth .
you are the opposite of batman .
you don &apos;t need them , man .
exactly . i &apos;ll see &apos; em when i see &apos; em .
totally .
you and i , we should hang out some time , huh ?
grab a drink ?
sure . where are you living now ?
the air vents .
i live in the air vents of the school . shhhh !
i &apos;m free , jeff . free !
i gotta get back in that class .
real dean coming through-- oh , my goodness spacious ,
vice dean ...
is this where greendale &apos;s money is going ?
more accurately , dean ,
it &apos;s where greendale &apos;s money comes from .
our air @-@ conditioning program has a job placement rate
five times higher than the rest of your school combined .
our alumnini donations comprise 80 %
of your entire school &apos;s budget .
and you want to know why we think we deserve
an espresso machine ? !
well , i guess i didn &apos;t know . i--
and you never had to , dean . you could have lived
the rest of your life in blissful ignorance
and died a happy , pansexual imp .
but you wanted to feel power this year .
well , now , you &apos;re going to feel my power
as it surges downward from me , straight through you ,
from nostril to rectum , now until the end of time .
and that &apos;s &quot; whazup . &quot;
i forgot everything you said before &quot; rectum &quot; !
who are these guys ?
this is my legal team because i think it &apos;s time
we worked out a new agreement .
he doesn &apos;t look like a lawyer .
that &apos;s a barber .
because i &apos;m also sick of that ridiculous goatee .
you look like a white lou gossett , jr .
you deserve a bigger office .
biggest office i ever had .
i &apos;m here to apologize , dr. king ,
and beg you for a seat in biology .
i tell you what , in sync , you wanna learn about life ?
give up the phone .
oh . you &apos;re asking me for a bribe ?
i can &apos;t be bought , man . you feel me ?
see , prison was my walls .
but you put your walls up .
you , and your phone , and your attitude ,
and your fruit loops cologne .
your walls put up so tight , man ,
not even a blade of grass could get through .
but even if it did , you wouldn &apos;t appreciate it .
that &apos;s why you can &apos;t come back to my class .
what &apos;s your problem with me , man ?
and don &apos;t act like it &apos;s not about me specifically
because you &apos;ve been in--
busted !
hey ! take it easy , winger .
everything okay ?
it is now that i have this .
this is my ticket to getting back in the group .
hey ! hey !
i want to be in the group so bad !
all right , let &apos;s smoke &apos; em and choke &apos; em .
no ! no ! n @-@ n @-@ n--
uh @-@ oh .
what is that ?
monkey gas !
monkey gas ?
oh , my g--
abed ?
all your friends are here .
they wanna talk to you .
i don &apos;t get it .
how is this different from the way he always is ?
i don &apos;t want to push it ,
but this would be a great time to baptize him .
abed , maybe this can be your new favorite show .
it &apos;s a british sci @-@ fi series
that &apos;s been on the air since 1962 .
britta , you &apos;ve done enough , okay ?
why don &apos;t you go start a ruiners &apos; club ?
oh wait , you &apos;d probably just ruin it .
well then , i &apos;d be doing a good job
because it &apos;s a ruiners &apos; club .
you ruined my analogy .
guys , look !
blimey , inspector !
where have we wound up this time ?
the question isn &apos;t where , constable , but when .
inspector , look out ! blorgons !
eradicate ! eradicate !
this is the best show i &apos;ve ever seen in my entire life .
having fun without me again ?
jeff , what happened ? you look 70 .
abed has a new favorite tv show , jeff .
it &apos;s called &quot; inspector spacetime &quot;
can it , boobs . i came here to let you know
that your best friend pierce is the one that got me
kicked out of bio class and the study group .
it was a plan he hatched from the beginning
with his pal , professor kane .
but , jeff , that &apos;s a photo i gave our professor
of me visiting hawthorne wipes &apos; spokesman
and rap artist sugar cube in prison during the &apos; 90s .
well , th @-@ th @-@ they look alike .
uh , i guess they share one important feature in your eyes .
well , that &apos;s not fair !
look , i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i was standing far away ,
and i saw the prison uniform !
oh , jeffrey !
oh , come on , obviously i don &apos;t mean
all black people are in prison !
jeff , clearly you have gone off the deep end .
don &apos;t blame him .
the table is powerful , and being cut off from it--
shut the--
i &apos;ve become ... agitated .
i apologize .
we &apos;ll continue this discourse at a later date .
good night .
he just needs some space .
i &apos;m going to kill the one thing you love !
i &apos;m gonna kill it !
as long as it breathes , it controls our lives !
i just came by to tell everyone
this year isn &apos;t gonna be that different .
with the notable exception , we really won &apos;t have any money .
have a nice night .
what is with that guy ?
did you find the monkey ?
no , but here &apos;s the invoice for the gassing .
okay , as it turns out , i cannot pay this ...
or your salaries starting on ... two weeks ago .
but , what i do have are these vouchers
for the classes of your choosing .
you &apos;re lucky i need my scuba certification .
okay , okay .
i &apos;m the one living in your vents .
i have no home and no job .
does that mean you &apos;ll work for room and board ?
okay , i was lying the whole time .
i didn &apos;t want the group to evolve .
i just didn &apos;t want pierce around . i hate him .
okay , but jeff , what you did-- it &apos;s hard to get past that .
i know you &apos;re already out of the study group ,
but i &apos;m gonna have to ask that you stop being my friend .
okay , look , everybody , here &apos;s the thing ,
i am not as evolved as i said i was .
the biology class was full , so i told professor kane
i &apos;d pay him a few thousand dollars to ...
k @-@ kick jeff out .
what ? !
pierce !
i can &apos;t believe jeff attacked a table with a fire axe
and still only managed to be the second craziest man in the room .
okay , everybody in favor of voting pierce out of the group ?
stop ! stop !
pierce isn &apos;t crazy .
the table ...
is ... magic .
as someone who &apos;s been on the other side ,
i can tell you ,
it is a scary , lonely , chang @-@ filled world out there ,
and sure , this group has sprouted some legs ,
but why are we in such a rush to leave the tide pool ,
when the only things waiting for us on shore
are the sands of time
and the hungry seagulls of slowly growing apart .
man , i really need this biology class .
pierce !
professor kane has never taken a bribe from anyone in his life .
you feel me ?
yeah , i lied , but you seem to have a harder time
being the bad guy than me .
you &apos;re right . i do ...
which , in a weird way , makes me a pretty bad guy .
we &apos;re one and the same .
please don &apos;t .
jeff , but you &apos;re still kicked out of biology .
oh , i &apos;m not worried about it .
life has a way of breaking through .
so , uh , here &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
i &apos;m a drug dealer , right ? and you &apos;re a scientist ,
so couldn &apos;t we get , like ,
a &quot; breaking bad &quot; type of thing going ?
sorry , star @-@ face , you just lost your seat in my class .
there , now the table is as good as new .
and so is abed .
britta , i &apos;m sorry i was overprotective about abed .
i &apos;ll try and be more supportive of you .
well , here &apos;s your first chance .
helping abed has inspired me to finally declare a major .
i &apos;m gonna study psychology .
like in a research capacity ?
no , in a hands @-@ on capacity . i &apos;m gonna be a therapist .
hey , hey , hey , keep it down .
there &apos;s a new sheriff in town .
interesting .
