my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
i need to be able to trust you with this .
nolan-- he keeps this box locked up
behind the painting . it &apos;s got this design .
was it something like this ?
it was exactly like that .
transient global amnesia ?
what you remember ?
nothing .
i shot her . i &apos;m turning myself in .
he will confess unless we act .
lydia goes .
lydia davis is a prime suspect
in the shooting of emily grayson .
you stay close to emily . but whatever you do--
don &apos;t trust the graysons .
daniel shot me .
when my father was in prison ,
he wrote in his journals about how the value of life
can be directly measured by our will to endure ,
that we have a remarkable ability to resist fatigue ,
to withstand pain ,
to keep fighting ,
as long as we don &apos;t lose sight of what we &apos;re fighting for .
with the queen &apos;s guard posted outside ,
i ... had to get creative .
or maybe you &apos;re using this visit as an excuse
to have purchased that jacket .
you remember me .
of course i do . i &apos;m fully recovered .
mentally , anyway .
how &apos;s aiden handling everything ?
poorly , but he &apos;s agreed not to retaliate against daniel .
what about you ?
how will emily thorne return with a vengeance this time ?
she won &apos;t .
it &apos;s over , nolan . i failed .
you survived .
i can &apos;t go back there .
not after everything that &apos;s happened .
i don &apos;t want to .
you know the hardest part about losing my memories was ...
having to relive them as they came back .
so much pain .
i just know that i have to get out of here ,
get out of the hamptons .
hey , you have to heal first .
i &apos;ll see you on my next rounds .
as long as she &apos;s in there , she &apos;s safe .
look , niko , i &apos;m beyond grateful for your help ,
and emily will thank you herself ...
if you would only let me tell her who i am .
if she thought for one moment
you were anything other than a nurse ,
she would refuse your help .
she can be stubborn . i just need to ask one more thing of you .
name it .
sneak her out . meet me here tonight .
aiden , are you sure that &apos;s a good idea ?
she &apos;s still really weak .
i just worry that the longer she stays in there ,
the more at risk she is .
not if i &apos;m watching over her .
unless you think i &apos;m the risk .
there &apos;s something you &apos;re not telling me , isn &apos;t there ?
we reconnected .
and before this went wrong ,
emily and i were going to leave ...
together .
right now i need to get her to safety
before anything else goes wrong .
so i &apos;m sorry you had to find out like this ,
but you were the only one who could help me .
yeah , seems so .
niko , please .
bring her to me .
okay ? hey .
it &apos;s the last thing i &apos;ll ask .
thank you .
i heard about your accident .
glad you &apos;re okay .
you should be by your wife &apos;s side ,
not mine . how would it look if someone saw you ?
i don &apos;t care .
all i care about is making things right with you .
that &apos;s why i covered your hospital bill--
so you wouldn &apos;t have to worry .
well , i don &apos;t want your money . i want you to leave me alone .
well , i can &apos;t , not after what ...
not after you hurt yourself like you did .
you ... you think i tried to kill myself ...
because you married emily ?
that is ... that is so typical grayson ,
believing everything is about you .
your roommate called me . she--
no , i was drunk , danny .
i passed out in the bath and almost drowned .
i was stupid , okay ? but i won &apos;t be stupid again .
oh , wait a minute . wait--
you stay out of this , jack .
no , that &apos;s not gonna happen . you okay ?
she &apos;s fine .
i wasn &apos;t asking you .
oh , you think you know everything , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , i do .
now pick yourself up and get the hell out of my bar .
it &apos;s good to see her resting .
she has endured so much pain .
yes . well , all pain is relative .
i hear her amnesia &apos;s lifting .
it is . although emily still can &apos;t recall
the night of the trauma .
but given her progress ,
i &apos;d be comfortable discharging her .
with her condition , you can &apos;t just let her walk out of here .
she still needs around @-@ the @-@ clock medical attention ,
which the rehab clinic would provide .
i believe she &apos;s going to recover completely ,
physically and mentally .
it &apos;s just a question of where she does it .
excuse me .
perhaps i can be of service , mrs. grayson .
she &apos;s awake .
good morning .
where am i ?
well , grayson manor , of course .
welcome home .
for your own sake , you &apos;ll wanna keep those shut .
the paparazzi heard the news that you &apos;re home ,
and they &apos;ll stop at nothing to steal your soul ...
if you believe in that sort of thing .
i don &apos;t understand . my ...
my doctor discharged me ?
yes , straight into my care and your nurse &apos;s .
we thought you &apos;d be more comfortable here .
you &apos;re a grayson now .
and we circle the wagons when tragedy strikes .
dr. sturman told me that your memories are recovering .
the last thing i remember was ...
the church , the wedding vows .
at least ... i have that happy moment .
and spared the traumatic details of your shooting .
i &apos;m trying to remember , but ...
daniel .
what happened to your eye ?
nothing worth mentioning ,
not compared to your injuries .
i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d been released .
i brought emily home for the remainder of her recovery .
actually , victoria , i think i &apos;d prefer to recuperate
in the beach house with my husband .
nonsense , especially considering that lydia &apos;s still on the loose .
i would never forgive myself if she finished what she started .
well , i &apos;ll leave you both alone for a moment .
it &apos;s nice to see you .
should probably get some rest .
hey , what the hell are you doing ?
containing the situation .
she &apos;s on the verge of remembering what you did ,
and we couldn &apos;t afford to have some random orderly at the hospital overhear it .
so we &apos;re holding her captive .
we &apos;re keeping up appearances to avoid suspicion .
for now , you are two newlyweds blissfully in love .
and what happens when she remembers that &apos;s not the case ?
let me take care of it .
in the meanwhile ,
try to keep your violent confrontations to a minimum .
all right ?
take my hand .
i don &apos;t need your help .
i think you do .
you &apos;re lucky she even let me come here .
you don &apos;t work for them ?
oh , i took her money .
but no .
okay . room &apos;s clear .
we can talk .
who do you work for ?
just myself ...
and the memory of my father .
you &apos;re takeda &apos;s daughter .
niko .
it &apos;s an honor to meet
the only student he ever spoke of with affection .
and mine to meet his only child .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
took some time to accept it .
how such a great warrior was killed by a random burglar .
when i heard about your setback ,
i thought i could help you overcome it .
it &apos;s what he would &apos;ve wanted .
thank you .
but my mission &apos;s over .
i &apos;m leaving as soon as i can walk out of here .
aiden said you were stubborn .
you know aiden ?
we met when he was on a mission in sydney ,
where my mum raised me .
then we reconnected last year after my father &apos;s death .
does he know that you &apos;re here ?
i &apos;ve been reporting your progress to him every day .
then please take me to him .
i have a bad feeling about being here .
maybe it &apos;s safest in the eye of the storm .
daniel ?
didn &apos;t know you were in .
are you okay ?
well , i &apos;m here , aren &apos;t i ?
how &apos;s emily ?
she &apos;s been discharged .
shouldn &apos;t you be home with her then ?
work will be here when you return .
not if we don &apos;t get this issue out .
i &apos;m looking at what you have .
and ?
the bones are here .
but ... i think you should dig deeper .
i handled the subject with integrity .
well , integrity doesn &apos;t sell magazines .
the story is lydia davis &apos; vengeful return to the hamptons .
to commit murder . you shied away from that .
because that &apos;s still speculation .
she hasn &apos;t been convicted . no , once she is ,
you &apos;ll kick yourself for having hesitated .
trust your instincts , margo ,
before someone else scoops our story .
how is our patient getting along ?
it &apos;s just a flesh wound .
would you give us a moment ?
not so long ago , i was ...
the one visiting you at your bedside .
and you were my savior .
and i &apos;m here in hopes that i can be yours .
it must be maddening not being able to remember
what happened that night on the boat .
clearly someone meant you harm .
lydia , so i was told .
or do you not believe it was her ?
well , i will once you tell me to .
if she did do it , conrad , why ?
you know her better than anyone .
your memories will return , emily .
and when they do , i suggest you come to me first .
look , you &apos;ve already taken two bullets to the stomach .
going forward ...
i &apos;d watch your back .
patrick ...
i need any details you can give me about that box
nolan has hidden in his house .
i &apos;m hiring someone to go in there and get it .
i can do it .
or do you not trust me ?
of course i do . you know that .
but i need a professional to do this .
sooner rather than later .
emily &apos;s recovering in my house ,
and i need every bit of leverage
i can get against her before she recovers her memory .
memory of what ? you ... you didn &apos;t shoot her .
no , i didn &apos;t .
daniel did .
you told me that lydia did .
you lied to me .
it was only to protect him .
and that &apos;s why you wanted to hire someone , right ?
to keep me from the truth .
patrick--
i came clean to you about nolan .
didn &apos;t i ? no , i actually-- i gave nolan up for you .
and after all these months ,
after everything that i &apos;ve shown you ,
after everything that i &apos;ve done ,
i will never , ever gain your confidence , will i ?
it is not that , patrick .
if it &apos;s not that , then what is it ? !
you tell me what it is , because i thought
we were on the same page . we &apos;ve talked about this ,
but i guess when it comes to choosing sons ,
no , no , you choose your blood over your bastard .
don &apos;t you ever say that again !
you are my blood .
you &apos;re the only pure thing i have ,
but i know that you &apos;re susceptible to the same darkness
that has followed me around my entire life ,
and it &apos;s infected this family ,
and i will not allow it to corrupt you as well .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s my duty , not yours ,
to expose emily thorne .
do you understand me ?
loud and clear , yeah .
all right .
don &apos;t worry . i come in peace . i promise .
sorry , water in my ear .
did you say , &quot; in peace &quot; or &quot; in complete shame
after having been yanked around by your umbilical cord &quot; ?
guess i deserve that .
either way , save it .
i &apos;ve got about four episodes of
&quot; patrick says i &apos;m sorry &apos; &quot; on my dvr .
well , do you have the one where he tells you
that he figured out his mom &apos;s a bitch ?
it took me longer than it should have to see her true colors .
she actually slapped me .
you didn &apos;t enjoy it ?
all i ever wanted from her was an honest relationship ,
find out who i am , more about where i came from .
the whole time ...
should &apos;ve been focused more on ... where i wanted to go .
where &apos;s that ?
anywhere with you .
all i &apos;m asking is for a peaceful evening
where we can avoid talking about anyone
within a 20 @-@ mile radius , okay ?
what do you say ? meet me at your place at 7 : 00 ?
make it 8 : 00
that way , it &apos;ll give me an extra hour to realize
this is a bad idea .
i hope you saved some energy for a visitor .
ems , since my mother put a moratorium on guests ,
i &apos;ll stand guard while you two catch up .
thank you . thanks .
he &apos;s getting so big .
yeah .
he &apos;s starting to walk now , too , if you can believe it .
well , that makes two of us .
oh . let me see him .
when charlotte found out that i brought carl back ,
she asked us to come by .
and besides , nolan and i were worried
when they moved you here .
this is my only shot of seeing you .
i &apos;m sure daniel told you i decked him .
what ?
it &apos;s stupid . i know , i know , but he came into the stowaway ,
and i just--just seeing him walking around free
after what he did ?
why didn &apos;t you turn him in ?
if i accuse him , they &apos;ll fight back .
i need to lay low until i can escape safely .
you gotta let it go .
i did .
it &apos;s my only chance at a ... normal life .
maybe when i get out of here , i &apos;ll ...
i &apos;ll have a family of my own .
listen , i was hoping you could get a message to aiden .
i am so sorry to do this ,
but bianca just said my mother &apos;s on her way home ,
and since it &apos;s me she &apos;ll blame ...
oh , thank you for taking the risk .
don &apos;t grow up too fast , buddy .
yeah .
come on . okay .
here we go .
oh , jack . carl dropped his puppy .
think he wants emily to have it ...
to keep you company .
thank you .
hello ?
patrick ?
if you &apos;ve hired someone , you can fire him .
i &apos;m on my way to nolan &apos;s right now .
no .
i told you i didn &apos;t want you to do it .
yeah , well ... it &apos;s too late .
just promise you &apos;ll stand by me when it &apos;s all done .
of course i will .
but , patrick , be safe .
he &apos;s part of a sick game ,
and whatever emily has hidden in that box ,
he is not going to let it go without a fight .
what exactly did you hear ?
something about a box patrick &apos;s supposed to retrieve ...
secrets victoria thinks you &apos;re keeping .
my infinity box .
everything &apos;s in there ... my ... father &apos;s journals ,
evidence of my takedowns ,
my identity .
well , where is it ? we need to stop him .
no .
no , let her find it .
it &apos;s over anyway .
so you &apos;re giving up .
this is the end of your great mission ...
everything you fought for .
i &apos;ve already lost the fight .
i &apos;m not supposed to be here .
i should be away with aiden , with his ring on my finger ,
not daniel &apos;s .
you and aiden are engaged ?
he proposed to me before everything went wrong .
look ... i know that you came back to help me get through this ,
but i am done .
that pain you &apos;re feeling ...
that &apos;s not because of me .
they did that to you ,
and you &apos;re letting them get away with it .
that woman i listened to my father go on about ,
the one who stole all his attention
and the affection i wished i had ...
this is how she ends up ?
i &apos;m glad he &apos;s not around to see it .
your father taught you well .
but nothing you say is gonna change my mind .
save your strength .
you &apos;re gonna need it to get out of here .
i &apos;m not gonna be around to help you .
oh , where did your nurse run off to ?
i gave her the night off .
oh . well , i couldn &apos;t have you go to bed without dessert .
martha made the most delicate profiteroles .
no , thank you .
i &apos;m sorry to bring this up , but ...
whatever happened between you and daniel
and the pregnancy , or lack thereof ,
is a private matter between you two .
however ...
while you were unconscious in the hospital ,
the doctors came to daniel with these test results .
when you came to ,
we feared that you weren &apos;t stable enough to face them ,
so i volunteered to deliver the news to you
when you were ready .
but now i &apos;m not sure if i &apos;m able to do it .
what is it ?
because of the location of the bullet wounds ,
and the surgeries required to save your life ,
the doctors had no choice .
a sacrifice had to be made .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll never be able to conceive , emily .
you &apos;re lying .
no .
feel free to confirm with dr. sturman
or seek a second opinion .
you see , this is why it &apos;s been so tragic for daniel
and why he &apos;s been so distant .
for you to have given him hope for an heir ,
only to have it taken away from him forever ...
get out .
fate can be so cruel .
what do you mean , she &apos;s gonna stay ?
i guess being there in that house forced her to refocus .
and how did she end up in that house in the first place ?
you were supposed to bring her to me .
what the hell happened ?
the graysons made a snap decision
and had her discharged .
look , you should be grateful
that i manipulated my way in there to protect her .
you know i &apos;d do anything for you .
not that you deserve my loyalty after you lied to me .
what are you talking about ?
well , you forgot to mention you were engaged .
and emily obviously doesn &apos;t know about us--
our past , how you left me in japan
with a promise to return .
don &apos;t worry . i didn &apos;t tell her .
would &apos;ve been easy to .
but i wouldn &apos;t hurt you like that .
please , will you ...
will you give her a message for me ?
of course .
just tell her not to do anything rash
until i can get to her .
it just ... doesn &apos;t sound like she &apos;s thinking clearly .
or maybe you just don &apos;t know her as well as you thought you did .
you know , this-- this is my house , right ?
you don &apos;t have to worry about beating last call .
oh , i thought we were still in the middle of happy hour , actually .
go make us a couple more , will ya ?
you know , i pretty much copyrighted the term &quot; lightweight , &quot;
and this will be , what ?
four ?
five .
five . for me .
careful .
not like we &apos;re driving home , right ?
do me a favor .
throw an extra olive in mine , will ya ?
or ... could just make you a real dinner .
this is a real dinner .
careful .
like i said ...
lightweight .
i can see that .
what the hell ? is that water ?
nolan , you &apos;ve been drinking water this whole time ?
well , not the whole time .
just when it became clear
you were trying to get me drunk .
you caught me .
given ... all we &apos;ve been through lately ,
i just ... didn &apos;t wanna risk losing control around you
or ... doing something i might regret .
i know exactly what you mean .
i can only imagine how this must have cost you .
not sure that you can , actually .
this was never about nolan or your family .
i didn &apos;t come here to be daniel &apos;s brother .
i didn &apos;t come here to be accepted by conrad .
i came here ... to get to know my mother .
but you and i sort of skipped over all the hard parts
so that we could pretend like everything was all right .
yeah .
it &apos;s not .
so ...
i &apos;ve already looked inside . i think you &apos;ll be pleased .
all you ever wanted was the truth , right ?
and that is all i &apos;m asking in return from you--
is the truth about my past .
i can &apos;t wait around for it much longer .
are you kidding me ?
i said i didn &apos;t wanna be seen with you .
well , maybe you should let me in , then .
wait . stop .
stop . you were right about before , okay ?
i was being self @-@ centered ,
and i shouldn &apos;t have made the assumption i did ,
but there are certain things that you don &apos;t understand , either .
yeah , well , maybe that &apos;s for the best , daniel .
do you wanna hear the truth or not ?
emily lied about the pregnancy .
she made it up to scare you away .
seriously ?
the only way she could keep us apart
was to trap me .
she knew i wouldn &apos;t walk away from my child .
how &apos;d you find out ?
she admitted everything after the wedding .
danny ...
did you ...
shoot her ? no .
well , if all this is true ,
then--then why are you still with her ?
if i kicked her to the curb , she &apos;ll--she &apos;ll make it look
as i &apos;m abandoning her , or--or worse ,
she &apos;ll make people wonder if i did try to kill her ,
just like you thought right now .
emily got what she always wanted .
she &apos;s a grayson now .
she won .
she &apos;s a psycho .
danny ...
i am ...
i am so sorry .
i see you &apos;re not the only one who can &apos;t sleep .
yes , it &apos;s been quite an evening .
where did you get that ?
if you &apos;re having trouble filling in the holes
of your past due to your so @-@ called amnesia ,
perhaps i can assist .
seems that lydia only had a piece of the puzzle .
but your game started long before this , didn &apos;t it ?
an article from the &quot; harvard crimson &quot;
highlighting daniel &apos;s freshman year .
i imagine that &apos;s when you first set your sights on him .
journals , detailing our habits .
bank statements ,
proving that you &apos;re not as wealthy as you pretended to be .
it &apos;s quite a grifter &apos;s treasure trove .
congratulations , victoria .
your instincts were right all along .
but while i came here for status ,
that &apos;s not why i stayed .
i truly loved daniel .
nothing you can say will save you now .
but what is a fitting end to someone
who &apos;s conned her way into society
and our family &apos;s lives ?
outing you to the press would be far too humane .
instead , tomorrow morning ,
i am going to call my list of who &apos;s who
who will in turn call their lists ,
because once word is out that you &apos;re a fraud ,
you will never grift in these circles again .
the bread and butter on which you depend
will dry up and you will wither away ,
dying the slow and lonely death
that emily thorne deserves .
if that &apos;s even your name .
oh , i don &apos;t have time for breakfast .
no , i &apos;ve got to get this to the publisher by 10 : 00 .
ah , come on .
you &apos;ve been working nonstop on this for two days .
you can take two minutes to eat ...
for me .
okay . only if you do something in return .
tell me what you think .
汉普顿的复仇
this was daniel &apos;s idea , wasn &apos;t it--
to lean into lydia ?
no , he simply gave me permission
to go where i was hesitant to .
and have you asked yourself why ?
okay , what are you trying to say , jack ?
i &apos;m trying to keep you from printing something
that isn &apos;t true .
because if it ever comes out that he used his own magazine
to cover this up , your career is over .
it wasn &apos;t lydia who shot emily . it was daniel .
why would you think that ?
i know that ...
&apos;cause emily told me .
well , if you miss this deadline ,
we &apos;re talking thousands in overtime ,
union fees , money we don &apos;t have to spend .
no , listen to me . ma @-@ margaux .
margaux &apos;s pressing &quot; pause &quot; on publishing .
perhaps she &apos;s seen the holes in her story .
thank you .
yes , sir .
what is this ? no one summoned the press .
actually ... i did .
thank you all for coming .
due to my weakened condition ,
my announcement will be a brief one .
in the past few days since my in @-@ laws brought me home ,
i have endured ... more pain than i thought humanly possible .
but i believe because of this journey ...
my memory has returned .
there has been much speculation as to who shot me ,
and i wanna set the record straight .
it was lydia davis .
and my husband and i are offering a $ 10 million reward
for her capture .
thank you .
mrs. grayson ! mrs. grayson ! mrs. grayson !
did you see the news yet ?
saw it ?
i laughed . i cried .
it &apos;s better than &quot; cats . &quot;
once again , i owe you .
we &apos;ll add it to your tab .
i &apos;m just glad you decided to stick around .
well , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to
if you hadn &apos;t switched out the infinity box at the last second .
victoria bought every detail .
i just hope you got away unscathed .
almost .
patrick won &apos;t be so lucky .
he wanted to know the truth about his mother ?
that &apos;s exactly what i plan on giving him .
i gotta go .
come in .
bianca . i was hoping you could help me with something .
thanks .
mrs. grayson ordered me not to leave your side ...
for your own safety .
well , most of my things are in my bedroom .
i mean , you could help me up the stairs ,
or i could just scream if i &apos;m in danger .
all right . wait here .
thanks .
i see you &apos;ve found your strength .
thank you for coming .
we don &apos;t have much time .
you saw my announcement ?
yeah . i did .
what the hell was that about ?
i had to accuse lydia to salvage my relationship with them .
so it &apos;s true , then ? you &apos;re staying .
i don &apos;t understand . what made you change your mind ?
they did .
i found out i can &apos;t have children .
they took my father , my mother ...
my best friend ...
and now this ?
that is exactly why
you shouldn &apos;t waste any more of your life on these people .
we can still move on .
we can build a future together .
this is my future , aiden .
i know i promised you a different one , but ...
i was wrong to .
you &apos;re ending this with me ?
you &apos;re gonna let them take this away from you , too , emily ?
think about what you &apos;re saying .
i have .
hate is a lot like love .
you can &apos;t force it .
you can &apos;t fight it .
you just have to embrace it when it comes along .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can handle it .
you just worry about yourself .
seems that &apos;s what &apos;s you &apos;re best at anyway .
you gotta eat some .
i can &apos;t eat &apos; em all .
you were wrong . it was lydia .
what ?
because of you , i missed the deadline ,
costing us money we don &apos;t have .
even worse , you made me doubt myself .
emily told me daniel shot her .
well , then why is she telling the world otherwise ?
all of you have been speculating who shot me .
i &apos;d like to set the record straight .
it was lydia davis .
and my husband and i are offering
a $ 10 million reward for her capture .
i can &apos;t believe it .
look , she suffered major head trauma .
perhaps when you spoke , she was delirious
or ... confused .
i should never have gotten involved .
i won &apos;t make that mistake again , okay ?
i know you were only trying to help .
let &apos;s just hope this issue is a hit .
my assistant is taking it to print as we speak .
i believe ...
this covers the risk you &apos;re taking and then some .
how much time do we have ?
i bought us four hours .
now what exactly did you have in mind ?
what are you doing here ?
you were right .
emily &apos;s staying to finish what she started .
see ? i told you .
i tried to talk her out of it .
like you said , she &apos;s stubborn .
my father used to say the same thing about her .
last night was the first time i stayed here
since he was murdered .
that &apos;s where the police found his body .
but something about it doesn &apos;t add up .
i don &apos;t know who did it .
they never had a suspect .
and i accepted that .
he spent his whole life training people to exact revenge .
being around emily made me realize
it &apos;s my duty to avenge him .
what else did she say ?
let &apos;s not talk about it .
let &apos;s not talk at all then .
i hope you both understand the significance
of my press announcement .
clearly , lydia didn &apos;t shoot me .
i know it was you , daniel .
but i forgive you .
i know you only sought revenge
because you thought i deserved it .
that doesn &apos;t change the fact that i love you .
and i just wanna know
how we &apos;re gonna handle this moving forward .
sorry . going forward ?
are--are--are you-- are you nuts ?
daniel , sit down .
by coming out to the press ,
emily cemented lydia &apos;s fate and saved yours .
so it &apos;s out there . it &apos;s done .
oh , but i can happily retract my statement ,
tell the world i was forced into it ,
and niko can confirm your motives
in spiriting me out of the hospital .
get on with it .
name your price , now that we know how you operate .
not this time .
like i said , i love your son ...
and i like the lifestyle .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
seems we &apos;re at a stalemate .
i &apos;d say so .
screw you .
i &apos;ve endured over 25 years in a loveless marriage .
you two will figure things out ...
until we find a more permanent solution .
seems i am home after all .
