ah , the romantic comedies of the &apos; 80s .
i learned everything i knew about
getting the girl from classics like &quot; can &apos;t buy me love , &quot;
because the romantic scenes that played out in my house
usually went a little something like this .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
birthday card .
my birthday was two weeks ago .
remember ? we had mexican food .
you had to race home in a mad panic .
well , that photo finish is why i forgot to give you a card .
you know what else you forgot to do ?
clean the garage .
give me some credit . i didn &apos;t forget .
it &apos;s gonna get done .
i &apos;ll get my pants .
happy belated birthday .
i had the kind of parents who loved each other ,
but i literally never once saw them kiss ,
which is why i was what you &apos;d call romantically challenged .
her name was dana caldwell .
she biked past my house every day ,
and she was perfect .
i &apos;m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt here ,
but i gotta say , this looks weird .
it &apos;s not weird . i &apos;m just filming a girl i like
to play the tape back later to practice talking to her .
oh , boy .
it &apos;s weird .
you know , i can help you out .
pops , i &apos;m 12 .
i gotta start handling this lady stuff on my own .
she &apos;s coming back .
get down ! get down !
while i was crawling away from the girl i loved ,
my father was trying to get the girl he loved off his back
by cleaning the garage .
all right , anything under $ 10--toss .
all that crappy art from when you were kids--toss .
no way ! it &apos;s my old keyboard !
this thing is awesome !
awesome , awesome , awesome .
i thought you said someone stole it .
yeah , well , the robber--she was supposed to throw it away .
a @-@ awesome , a @-@ awesome , a @-@ awesome , a @-@ awesome .
it &apos;s going in the garbage .
no . this is mine , and i love it , okay ?
holy crap ! check this out .
i found a box of dad &apos;s old love poems to mom .
don &apos;t touch that ! don &apos;t touch that !
come on . it &apos;s none of your business .
ready ?
&quot; tears stain the pillows of my heart . &quot;
come on . come on .
no , no , come on !
&quot; your perfume lingers on my mind .
return to me , my love . &quot;
come on , come on !
god , you &apos;re terrible .
okay , stop it . give me that box .
give--
&quot; our bodies are one under the starry sky .
there is no me , only us ...
my sweet anita &quot; ?
what ? it says here you were gonna have a wedding ?
anita ? who &apos;s anita ?
ohh . i see what &apos;s going on here .
you have a secret family .
if i had a secret family ,
why would i be standing here talking to you people ?
give me that box !
here !
come on !
got it !
all right ! i &apos;ll tell you the story .
before your mother , i was engaged to another woman .
you &apos;re so hosed .
hosed , hosed .
i am not hos-- turn that off !
i am not hosed .
nobody &apos;s getting hosed .
your mom knows about the engagement .
oh , and she knows all about the love letters ?
of course she knows !
she knows .
come on , kids , give me the box !
i wish i had a secret family !
i &apos;m so hosed .
october 4th , 1980 @-@ something--
the day my dad &apos;s old love letters went public .
bevy , before you say anything ,
just know that i thought i threw this box out years ago
when anita sent it back to me ,
and it--it means nothing .
my father had crossed a line .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
i thought i could keep a straight face , but i can &apos;t .
so you &apos;re not mad at me ?
no , i &apos;m worried . how are your loins ?
have they stopped burning ?
is your heart still a flutter ?
yeah .
adorable .
yeah .
oh , no , no , no .
so you &apos;re not even a little bit jealous ?
please . i won .
i bagged my moose .
you see ? she doesn &apos;t give a crap .
that &apos;s what a strong marriage is--
mutual not @-@ giving @-@ a @-@ crap .
see ? not hosed .
okay .
we &apos;ve had a good laugh . time to chuck &apos; em .
chuck &apos; em ? i can &apos;t even put &apos; em down .
i mean , dad used to be ... pretty romantic .
oh , he &apos;s still plenty romantic with me .
yuck .
and how is dad romantic ?
for the last two years , he forgot your anniversary .
in his defense , i didn &apos;t remind him enough .
but he writes romantic stuff to me all the time .
look . here &apos;s my birthday card .
&quot; x.o.x.o. murray . &quot;
well , the x &apos;s are for kisses ,
and the o &apos;s for hugs .
and &quot; murray ... &quot;
is who it &apos;s from .
doesn &apos;t matter what he writes .
we are more in love than ever .
don &apos;t you at least wanna see what she looks like ?
i &apos;ve gone 20 years
without needing to know what she looks like .
i &apos;m not gonna start now .
oh , plus where would you even get a picture ,
you know , if someone wanted to see a picture ?
where would you find it ? i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;d probably have an engagement announcement in the paper .
i mean , if you really wanted to look ,
you could probably just go to the library and dig it up .
i don &apos;t need to see it .
fine .
but if you would feel better seeing it ,
fine , we &apos;ll go to the library . jeez .
while my mom was feeling insecure ,
i was feeing damn good . i had a plan .
dana caldwell would see me cooly tinkering with my bike
and ask me to go for a ride , and then we would get married !
it was now or never . time for my &quot; a &quot; game .
bicycles , right ?
bicycles .
nope .
do you know how to fix them ?
well ... my bike chain &apos;s all messed up .
maybe you could take a look ?
yeah , i can ... i can take a quick look @-@ see .
chain . chain .
wait . is this one of those soviet bikes ?
&apos;cause i only deal with american equipment .
huh ?
u.s.a. !
maybe i &apos;ll just have my dad fix it .
makes sense . keep it in the family .
are you okay ?
are you crying ?
no .
good talking .
my plan was a complete bust .
i only had one option left--call in the big guns .
so what happened to &quot; i &apos;m 12 . i gotta go it alone &quot; ?
that didn &apos;t work out so great .
well , you &apos;re safe now . love &apos;s my business ,
and business is booming .
so what do we got ?
okay . her name &apos;s dana . she &apos;s 13 , lives down the block .
she smells like fruity pebbles .
why are you asking pops for help
when you got all the resources you need right here ?
you don &apos;t know anything about girls .
i know a ton . i &apos;ve go super hot girlfriend .
yeah , from canada that no one &apos;s ever seen .
&apos;cause i met her at camp , ya sausage gobbler .
you couldn &apos;t come up with something a little more original ?
i mean , a fake girlfriend ... in canada ?
hey ! there &apos;s nothing fake about her except her boobs !
yep , they &apos;re huge and real ... but they &apos;re also fake .
you know what ? i don &apos;t have to explain it to you .
i &apos;m outta here .
her breasts sound very complicated .
so where are we at with this dana girl ?
well , i &apos;ve been secretly following her around for two weeks .
creating a sense of mystery .
and today i broke her bicycle .
good . you made a memorable first impression .
and i kinda cried in front of her .
some women like a sensitive man .
you think ?
you can &apos;t help him , pops . he &apos;s un @-@ help @-@ able .
he &apos;ll never get a girlfriend even half as hot as mine .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s her name ? tell me right now . go .
marion lemieux .
marion lemieux ?
like mario lemieux , the hockey player ?
yeah ! it &apos;s a common last name in canada ,
like &quot; smith &quot; or &quot; jones . &quot;
i was trying to be nice to you , but forget it .
i &apos;m outta here .
okay .
your next move with dana is important .
you gotta go for it .
make a big gesture--
something that &apos;ll show her exactly how you feel .
waste of time .
here we go .
this nerd has no clue with the ladies .
yeah ? let &apos;s call marion right now .
think i won &apos;t ? &apos; cause i will .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m asking you to do .
i don &apos;t need this ! i &apos;m outta here .
meanwhile , my mom and erica were using
the most cutting edge technology
to track down a photo of anita .
mom .
it was called microfiche .
move .
oh my god .
it &apos;s amazing . it only took us two hours to find it .
hey , not bad , dad .
okay , erica , you saw her .
now you can move on with your life .
wait a minute .
how do you ...
what ?
make it bigger ?
well , okay , just ...
make the picture bigger .
okay , here .
where &apos;s the knob to make it a bigger picture ?
mom , god ! that &apos;s as big as it goes .
okay , okay .
what is it ?
oh , no .
as always , my mom took the bad news
with grace and dignity .
my ring .
bevy !
what a day ! what a day !
sold six couches !
your man is on fire .
by sheer chance , my dad was in a rare good mood that night .
unfortunately , my mom was not .
what &apos;s happening ?
nothing .
take a load off .
well , i usually take a load off right there .
but i &apos;ll put my load right here .
what do you ...
is there anything you wanna tell me about this ring ?
it &apos;s a symbol of our love ?
yes , that &apos;s very true .
but , uh , tell me about that .
what made you pick this exact ring for me ?
when i saw it , it spoke to me .
what did it say ?
&quot; i &apos;m a pretty ring .
buy me . &quot;
&quot; buy me &quot; for who ?
oh , boy .
how could you give me her ring ?
what do you think i &apos;m made of , diamonds ?
i ... you can &apos;t just return these !
okay , well , i have no problem returning this one .
wait . bevy !
let &apos;s talk about this . listen .
if it &apos;ll make you feel any better ,
i will get you a new ring .
great . get me a new ring .
what ? ! you can &apos;t say that .
why would i get you a new ring ? !
it was your idea !
yeah , but i &apos;m filled with terrible ideas !
i gave you a used ring , for god sake .
wow , murray , you are so romantic !
fine ! i &apos;ll get you a new ring !
fine !
fine !
fine !
fine !
while my parents were calmly working out their problems ,
i &apos;d finally come up with a solution
to my problems with dana .
let &apos;s do this , lloyd .
i &apos;d use my favorite romantic movie ,
&quot; say anything ... &quot;
to win dana &apos;s heart .
what are you doing ?
oh , crap ! i thought this was your sister &apos;s room .
well , it &apos;s not .
can you tell dana i &apos;m ... here ?
mm , no . this is kind of a creepy thing to do , bro .
what the hell &apos;s going on out here ?
nothing , sir . go back to bed .
some weird kid &apos;s here for dana .
adam ? what are you doing ?
adam ? this is the kid who broke your bike ?
yeah .
not cool , man .
you have a lovely home .
pleasure meeting you !
calm down , kiddo .
we can fix this .
we can &apos;t !
i serenaded her brother , i dropped my boombox ,
and i soaked my lloyd dobler coat .
i understood none of that . did you take my advice ?
yes . a big gesture .
i stood outside her window and blasted music at her .
why would you do that ?
you told me to !
i meant take her out for a milkshake .
how is a milkshake a big gesture ? !
for you , it &apos;s big .
you should have been more specific !
wait . don &apos;t go , kiddo . we can just regroup .
forget it .
the movies lie . none of it &apos;s real !
love isn &apos;t real .
tell that to my girlfriend .
she &apos;s not real !
all right , let &apos;s get this over with .
one ring , please .
of course . do you have anything in particular in mind ?
don &apos;t look at me . just pick something that speaks to you .
okay .
all right , uh , this one &apos;s talking up a storm .
how much is it ?
that one is $ 5,000 .
is that the one i pointed to ?
you pointed at that one , yeah .
it just stopped speaking to me .
stopped completely .
oh , really ?
yeah .
is that because i &apos;m not worth the money ?
no , no , no , no , no . don &apos;t do that , bev .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t do that .
really ? how much am i worth to you ?
i cannot put a price on love .
i can . uh , how much is this ring worth ?
oh . very nice .
yes , excellent cut . beautiful clarity .
you must really love this lady .
it used to belong to his ex @-@ fiance ,
anita .
oh , add that story .
and he re @-@ gifted it to me .
all right , do that .
yeah , and he used to write her
lots of love letters and poems .
oh , yeah , tell him--yeah .
how many do you think he &apos;s written to me ?
um ... i &apos;m gonna guess it &apos;s a ... low number .
zero .
that &apos;s very low .
yeah .
okay . that &apos;s because
anita needed love letters and all that crap all day long .
it &apos;s why we broke up .
that &apos;s all i was doing , was writing letters .
i didn &apos;t get to watch any tv .
oh , listen to this guy .
he thinks i don &apos;t need love letters .
that &apos;s why i chose you .
you don &apos;t need any of that romantic junk .
oh , that &apos;s right . just give ol &apos; bev
a hallmark card and a used ring .
all right , you know what ?
we &apos;re gonna get you the $ 5,000 ring ,
and you can be the one who tells adam
that his teeth are gonna be crooked for the
rest of his life .
great . that &apos;s exactly what i want--a spite ring .
great , because that &apos;s what you &apos;re getting .
oh . okay , my friend , we are buying the ring .
i &apos;d like you to ring it up ,
because we are buying it !
all right .
i don &apos;t know what to do here .
you heard the man . ring it up .
all right , but just so you know ,
we have a strict no return policy .
ring ... it ... up .
in most houses , a dinner this quiet was normal ,
but in our house , no yelling
meant something very bad was going down .
what &apos;s happening ?
dad bought mom a spite ring ,
and now she &apos;s wearing the spite ring to spite him .
lot of love problems around here .
not barry .
i keep my lady satisfied .
dude ...
i was at camp with you .
there &apos;s no girl named marion lemieux .
she was in the large @-@ chested foxy girl bunk ,
and you were in the annoying sister bunk ,
so you probably never crossed paths .
really ? &apos; cause i thought you were in the large @-@ chested girl bunk .
original .
adam ! dinner &apos;s almost over !
come on ! get out of the stupid tree !
i &apos;m not hungry ! go away .
what &apos;s going on ?
i just wanna be alone , okay ?
like how i &apos;ll be for the rest of my life .
what are you talking about ? you &apos;re 10 years old .
i &apos;m 12 . and ...
i really screwed things up with a girl .
yeah ? tell me about it .
well , her name &apos;s dana--
no , i didn &apos;t mean &quot; tell me about it &quot;
&quot; tell me about it . &quot; i meant , i screwed up
with a girl , too . oh ! my gosh .
so is the girl mom ?
yes , it &apos;s mom !
your mother seems to think that i don &apos;t show her
that i care about her enough .
i show her all the time ,
just not in big ways , but in little ways--
you know , ways that she doesn &apos;t notice ,
not like a box of love letters .
there &apos;s no record of the stuff that i do .
you know , maybe there is .
there isn &apos;t .
what if there were ?
there &apos;s not .
dad , i &apos;m saying i have an idea .
my dad may not have been able to say
how he felt about my mom ,
but luckily , i recorded a bunch of ways that showed it .
turns out the most romantic movie of the &apos; 80s
was the one that i made with my dad .
i hate my new ring . i &apos;m gonna take it back tomorrow .
but the man said no returns .
i &apos;ll guilt him into it .
it &apos;s what i do .
it was the first time we ever saw them kiss ,
and it was gross .
but i started to believein love again .
i mean , it was complicated as hell , but it was real .
maybe those romantic movies weren &apos;t so far off after all .
me ?
yeah , you .
you ... left this on our lawn .
yeah , i ...
i did . i &apos;m sorry .
the other night was ... weird .
you know , my dad told me not to talk to you anymore .
i @-@ i get it .
too bad i never listen to my dad .
wanna go for a ride ?
just like i told him--
go big or go home .
yeah . think you can help me out with some girl stuff ?
oh . what happened to miss canada ?
long distance . it &apos;s-- it &apos;s killing us .
we never talk , and when we do , we fight .
she &apos;s not real .
there goes the fluffage , different directions .
is that like a bald spot ?
yeah , yeah , we do have a bald spot there .
murray !
what ? !
murray !
what ? !
murray !
what &apos;s going on ?
murray !

murray !
well , where are you ? !
