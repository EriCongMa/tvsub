damon &apos;s gone !
alaric will compel away any memories
i had of damon and me being together .
tyler and stefan are on board .
just take it away , please .
vampires can &apos;t get into mystic falls .
they can lurk around the borders .
no !
caroline compelled her to forget elena attacked her .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
you &apos;re from mystic falls ?
one of the founding families actually .
any final words ?
where the hell are we ?
1994 .
we got here by magic .
magic should be able to get us out .
look who got 27 across .
i didn &apos;t finish this .
well , neither did i.
there &apos;s someone else here .
stefan didn &apos;t say good @-@ bye .
damon and bonnie died and he just left .
let her go .
ain &apos;t a parking lot , kid .
yeah ? well , i &apos;m not here to work .
need a few days off .
and it looks like i need a new mechanic .
i said i need a few days off .
are you slow ?
let me simplify .
stay--keep the job . leave--lose it .
how the hell are you so strong ?
you hired a vampire .
next time , do a background check .
now shut up and don &apos;t move .
you have no idea how long i &apos;ve wanted to do that .
see , i was trying to get a fresh start ,
live a normal life , normal job ,
normal dick of a boss .
that &apos;s you by the way .
this place was supposed to be my sanctuary ,
and it was until yesterday .
come with me .
that &apos;s my girlfriend ivy .
somebody killed her last night right in front of me ,
so now i need to go back home--
last place on this planet i want to be--
find him , and kill him .
like i said , i need a few days off .
you should take a few days off .
thanks , buddy . i will .
now i need you to drive my car
into the woods .
you &apos;re gonna bury my girlfriend
and forget this ever happened .
oh , and when i get back , you &apos;re giving me a raise .
so i , uh , volunteer at the hospital until , like , 2 : 00,
and then i figure we can carpool
to the party at the swimming hole .
um , normally when you move back in , you unpack .
i &apos;m not staying .
last night was just a momentary moment of weakness .
momentary moment ?
are you sure you don &apos;t want to come back to school ?
caroline , needing your friends isn &apos;t a weakness ,
momentary or otherwise .
tell that to stefan , who clearly needs no one .
cut him some slack .
he lost his brother .
granted , said brother was a soulless homicidal maniac ,
but still .
what ?
nothing . i just-- i got to go .
i &apos;ve got breakfast with enzo , so ...
enzo ?
you guys go on one road trip ,
and all of a sudden , you &apos;re breakfast buddies ?
yeah , i guess so .
ironically , he &apos;s recently become
one of the more stable people in my life .
ok . then invite him to the party .
elena .
come on . i got matt to take the afternoon off from his training
and tyler to give the practice squad a break .
even jeremy is coming .
it &apos;s been forever since we &apos;ve all been together .
it &apos;ll be fun .
don &apos;t make me invoke the nuclear option .
because i will selfie bomb you
every 5 minutes .
ok . fine . i &apos;ll go to the party .
yay !
but i &apos;m not moving back in .
that is a conversation to be had over jell @-@ o shots .
what did alaric do to her ?
all i know is she doesn &apos;t remember whatever it is she saw in damon ,
and we &apos;re supposed to keep it that way .
i just spent the whole night with her ,
and it &apos;s weird .
she just doesn &apos;t seem like her old self .
yeah . it &apos;s because she &apos;s happy .
isn &apos;t that the point ?
i guess .
look . i got to go . i &apos;ll see you later .
it &apos;s a little early for a carwash .
oh , yeah . i brought in some mulch
so you guys could clean up that little park on 4th .
turns out red mulch stains .
who knew ?
my friends are having a party ,
and i &apos;d like to go by this afternoon after lunch .
you need a permission slip ?
no .
i &apos;m not your mom . go .
and take jay . suckered him into washing my car .
he needs some fun .
you &apos;re driving . i &apos;m drinking .
both of you , keep your eyes open .
we &apos;ve had a lot of animal attacks lately .
he means dog bite girl .
yeah . i know what he means .
that shower has 4 heads .
who &apos;s so dirty they need 4 heads ?
you &apos;d be surprised .
you want bourbon or , well , bourbon ?
i hate bourbon , but i love this house .
can i just pretend that i found my dad
and it &apos;s whoever lives here ?
trust me . it &apos;s not .
why not ? my mom lived in mystic falls
for years before she had me .
somebody had to knock her up .
you ever think about asking her ?
oh . good idea . hurry .
let &apos;s go to the cemetery .
gotcha . sorry .
who does live here anyway ?
two brothers .
one moved . the other is dead .
hey . quick question .
quick answer . no .
hilarious . we &apos;re having a party today .
you think you could spare a keg or two from scull bar ?
you can come .
you and alcohol and my brother .
why does that combination sound so familiar and terrible ?
who is your trachea , luke ?
in fairness , he apologized .
i &apos;m working on this , ok ?
i watch my drinking ,
i avoid things that make me angry .
come by the bar after 1 : 00 .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
you &apos;re doing that thing again .
what thing ?
oh , the thing where you &apos;re a bitch
because you like somebody .
it &apos;s pretty transparent .
i don &apos;t blame you . he &apos;s hot .
hey , cutebrag .
did you just call me cutebrag ?
hey . i didn &apos;t come up with it .
another one of the volunteers did .
what ? sometimes , you brag .
at least it has &quot; cute &quot; in it .
small favors .
i &apos;m liam , you &apos;re elena .
see how easy it is to remember ?
brag .
is there something you wanted other than to destroy my self @-@ esteem ?
actually , yes .
are you doing anything this afternoon ?
my friends are throwing a party
just outside my hometown ,
and there &apos;s a girl that i actually want you to meet .
just come .
ok .
stefan ?
what--
for the record , 4 months is far too long
for me to go without seeing you .
i know . that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i wanted to stop by and say hi .
i got it .
ok .
we need strawberries , eggs ,
milk , and--ooh-- candles .
i know it &apos;s been a while ,
but you couldn &apos;t do magic as an anchor ,
so i &apos;m curious what momentary lapse of reason
makes you think you can do it now .
you know , when all this started ,
you sucked at making pancakes ,
and now they &apos;re somewhat edible .
milk . there &apos;s no reason to be peter pessimist .
we have proof we &apos;re not alone .
first of all ...
don &apos;t nickname .
that &apos;s my thing .
and this proof , this mysteriously filled in
crossword , could very easily have been you .
i didn &apos;t fill it in .
no . you don &apos;t know you filled it in .
you also don &apos;t know that you talk in your sleep .
eggs .
what are you saying ?
are you saying i sleep crossword ?
i &apos;m saying it makes more sense than the alternative .
i get what you &apos;re doing .
what am i doing ?
you refuse to have hope that you &apos;ll see elena again
so you don &apos;t have to be disappointed .
i refuse to have hope because there &apos;s nothing to hope for .
pork rinds .
not on the list and eww .
no , damon .
there were pork rinds here on this shelf .
there have been pork rinds here
on every shopping trip we &apos;ve had
for the past 4 months .
you hear that ?
you hear that , damon ?
that &apos;s what hope sounds like .
this hospital thing ,
it &apos;s a whole new look , huh ?
yeah . apparently this color disguises
all bodily fluids that i could get covered in throughout the day .
so far , it &apos;s been mostly observation ,
but--i don &apos;t know-- i love it there .
seeing sick people getting better , it &apos;s inspiring .
you seem different .
you seem , um , happier .
and you ? are you happy ?
caroline filled me in a little bit .
oh . about the , uh , dinner party from hell .
her exact words actually .
and in between the ranting , she may have mentioned
something about a new job
and a new girlfriend .
ivy , right ? is it ivy ?
stefan , it &apos;s fine . seriously .
it &apos;s not weird , i promise .
i &apos;m just happy to finally see you again , you know ?
it &apos;s been really rough losing bonnie the last couple of months ...
which is an incredibly insensitive thing to say
to somebody who just lost their brother .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
no . i &apos;ve been working on the healing thing , too ,
i guess .
hey . uh , by the way , have you , uh , heard from caroline ?
she &apos;s not returning any of my calls ,
and i really want to apologize for the way i acted .
well , she &apos;ll be there at the swimming hole today .
you should come .
no , no . i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready to dive back into all that .
no pun intended .
stefan , they &apos;re your friends , too .
come on . i know that we can &apos;t hang out at the grill anymore ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean we can &apos;t all spend time together .
come on , please .
if not for that , then at least to convince caroline that enzo
is not new best friend replacement material .
will enzo be there ?
yeah , but i can easily uninvite him .
i &apos;d rather you come .
no . don &apos;t worry about it .
yeah . maybe i &apos;ll stop by .
great .
do you understand the rules ?
yeah . rule one-- don &apos;t mention elena was madly in love with damon ,
or you &apos;ll kill me .
rule two--don &apos;t really reference damon at all , or you &apos;ll kill me .
yeah .
rule 3-- wear sunscreen--
don &apos;t make fun of me .
it &apos;s important that we let elena live her new happy ,
problem @-@ ignoring zombie life the way she wants .
a sentence which sounded oddly supportive and judgmental .
i support her . she did what she needed to do
to stop chomping on innocent people on the road ,
but it doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m enjoying
marinating all alone in my misery .
well , i &apos;ll marinate with you .
i appreciate it . really , i do .
but i &apos;m not stefan .
rule number 4-- don &apos;t ever mention that jerk &apos;s name again , or--
or you &apos;ll kill me . got it .
is that blood or pie ?
please say pie .
that would be , uh ...
shirley , a special off @-@ the @-@ menu item .
this little diner is surprisingly well @-@ stocked .
tell me that you snatched , ate , erased .
funny thing about that .
you do the first two properly ,
the third isn &apos;t necessary .
you killed her ?
oh , don &apos;t act all shocked .
well , i &apos;m sorry , but death shocks me ,
and it also leads to a missing persons report ,
which leads to--
a sheriff &apos;s investigation ?
i &apos;m terrified .
i already have 3 warnings .
one more , it &apos;s a fine .
it &apos;s got to be a short ,
faulty wiring , something .
or someone put a quarter in it
and turned it on .
you know , i &apos;m a little confused
with all this misplaced hope .
all right . let &apos;s just say there &apos;s someone here .
how do you know we &apos;re gonna get out ?
well , you say that this is your hell , right ?
if there &apos;s someone else here ,
that means it &apos;s not your hell ,
and if it &apos;s not your hell , that means grams put us here ,
and if grams put us here ,
there &apos;s a way out .
there &apos;s a hell of a logic knot you &apos;ve tied for yourself .
thank you .
so now that we &apos;ve properly placed our hope , let &apos;s play a game .
when we get out ,
what &apos;s the first thing you &apos;re gonna tell elena ?
sorry i killed bonnie ,
but she was the most annoying person
in the world .
she wouldn &apos;t shut up .
she just kept talking .
i mean , it &apos;s a wonder i made it as long as i did ,
but here &apos;s the thing .
i think it &apos;s better this way
because she didn &apos;t have magic ,
and she was pretty much useless .
damon .
what ?
i don &apos;t know . you still think i &apos;m useless ?
that &apos;s my car .
that &apos;s my car !
she &apos;s determined but sweet ,
ernal optimist ,
never forgets a birthday .
what else ?
never gives up on her friends .
yes . true . she &apos;s completely loyal .
this is good . build her up .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll live up to these ridiculously high expectations .
that &apos;s another one .
great at surpassing expectations .
so she &apos;s perfect .
totally .
pretty much .
so how long have you two been together ?
us ? no . i &apos;m-- we &apos;re--heh .
we &apos;re not , but , i mean , we did at one point--
not any more .
was that recent ?
because you two seem weirdly functional .
has it already been two years ?
time flies .
how much longer are we gonna listen--
this sound is the opposite sound of your voice ,
and i so enjoy it .
how did it even get here , damon ?
did you leave it here in 1994 ?
i don &apos;t know , bonnie .
it was 18 years ago .
has a lot going on that day .
ok . so you admit that it &apos;s pretty unlikely that you did .
every unlikely .
which would stand to reason that ...
someone may have put it here , bonnie .
yes . i admit that .
damon ...
i know .
i &apos;m gonna tell elena how much i love her ,
and then i &apos;m gonna apologize for killing you .
wait . did you see that ?
i did that time .
let &apos;s go meet our little friend .
so is a lake different from a swimmin &apos; hole , or ...
swimming hole .
thanks for making me sound like a redneck .
why ? where did you party in high school ?
oh . somebody &apos;s house or second house ,
whichever had the biggest pool .
huh . i guess i do brag .
yup . now it &apos;s my turn to brag
because i bet nobody at your pool parties could do this .
jeremy ?
oh , my god .
elena .
sorry to interrupt what i &apos;m sure was
a heartfelt display of true love ,
but i &apos;m jeremy &apos;s sister ,
and we were about to have a nice little family chat .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m happy i &apos;m an orphan .
you invited the girl that i attacked ?
no . i brought the girl caroline compelled to forget you attacked .
she doesn &apos;t know anything .
jer , why would you even risk it ?
because she looks good in a bikini .
can i go now ?
yeah . i may be driving , but if you puke in my truck ,
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
you know , dog bite girl &apos;s kind of hot
in , like , a trashy way , though .
why do you keep calling her that-- dog bite girl ?
because it &apos;s ridiculous . what kind of dog
bites you in the neck .
i don &apos;t know , man .
i &apos;ve seen some pretty vicious dogs .
what &apos;s up , ty ?
i just got a text from elena .
she wants to see us .
hold on .
are you telling me that you think a girl
with two puncture wounds in her neck
got bit by a dog ?
i think if that &apos;s what she said
then that &apos;s what happened .
then you &apos;re an idiot .
and you &apos;re a wasted douchebag .
we all have faults .
you want to say that a little louder ?
jay , back off .
no , no , no . i think you just called me a douchebag .
i just want to make sure .
whoa , jay ! jay , what you &apos;re doing right now ,
definition of a douchebag .
simmer .
i &apos;m just playing .
you guys want beers ?
yeah .
sorry , man .
hey . it &apos;s stefan
leave a message .
yeah . not answering is one of his new things .
he said he was here to apologize .
lying . also one of his new things .
stefan has a lot of new things .
hey . have you guys seen sstefan ?
i didn &apos;t even know he was back .
so you want to fill us in on what we &apos;re doing here ?
you don &apos;t remember this place ?
we used to sneak off here and get wasted
while our parents were outside grilling .
granted , we all have a few less parents ,
but we can still have fun .
actually , i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m working on my rage issues ,
and this wouldn &apos;t help .
my buddy &apos;s wasted , and i &apos;ve got to train in the morning , so ...
ok . well , i don &apos;t want to sound like an alcoholic ,
but i do want a shot ,
so will someone do one with me ?
done !
bottoms up .
well ... here we are ,
having fun .
i &apos;m having fun .
aren &apos;t we having fun ?
this is really fun .
ok . clearly , this was a big mistake .
i just wanted to spend one afternoon
where we pretend for just one second
like we &apos;re not all drifting apart .
well , that &apos;s thproblem , elena .
not all of us are ok with pretending .
some of us prefer to face our problems head @-@ on .
i think we should go .
yeah .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m just lonely , ok ?
and bonnie &apos;s gone , stefan &apos;s gone .
enzo , shocker , terrible , murderous friend .
i &apos;m still here , car .
yeah .
you &apos;re still here .
here take another shot and ...
ok . not so much .
it was behind the pickup .
no . it was in the front .
are you sure ?
yes . absolutely i &apos;m sure .
it was right there .
it was a tarp .
we saw a tarp .
and that , that is on a timer .
that turned on by itself .
but your car .
i left it here in &apos; 94 .
and the crossword ?
you filled it out , bonnie .
which means we &apos;re alone
in my own hell
with no grams escape hatch .
we &apos;re never getting out .
give me your ring .
what ?
give me your ring .
all i &apos;ve heard you say is that you have no hope
and that this is your hell ,
so if it &apos;s so bad , why don &apos;t you just end it ?
hope is the only thing keeping me going , damon ,
so if you &apos;re really done , if you have none ,
then be done .
because this isn &apos;t helping .
rough day , huh , damon ?
sorry . manners . i &apos;m kai .
nice to meet you .
pork rind ?
so you &apos;re sure you &apos;re ok to find your way back home ?
sorry . my friend caroline &apos;s having a bit of a crisis .
it &apos;s been a rough couple of months for her .
she &apos;s normally really sweet .
actually , i &apos;m glad i didn &apos;t meet her
because then it would have been awkward when i did this .
kissing a girl who &apos;s trying to set you up with her best friend ?
red flag .
maybe . i have a sneaking suspicion that &apos;s your type .
that was caroline &apos;s ice .
yeah . well , you &apos;ll be dead ,
so i think she &apos;ll let you off the hook .
i don &apos;t want to kill you , stefan .
but it looks like he did .
i thought i told enzo to go get more ice .
did you do it in that tone ?
because i think i know why he didn &apos;t .
congratulations . now it &apos;s your job .
go get ice .
aren &apos;t we supposed to be having fun ?
is that why you brought your latest fling
in a series of sad attempts to pretend like you don &apos;t care about bonnie --
to have fun ?
right . cavalry &apos;s on their way ,
so why don &apos;t we put a pin in our little spat
till this all gets sorted , eh ?
no , thanks .
you &apos;ve got to be bloody kidding me .
i just saved your life .
so you can give me a lifetime full of misery .
well , that &apos;s fine . i &apos;m just gonna shorten the lifetime .
stefan .
good news , caroline .
i thwarted a vampire hunter .
bad news -- stefan has become a vampire hunter .
what are you doing ?
why don &apos;t you ask him ?
what did you do ?
that is gonna have to stop .
oh , you think this is annoying ?
try listening to you and bonnie bicker every 5 minutes .
so you &apos;ve been following us .
of course i have .
you two are the closest thing i have a to a tv .
i mean , you &apos;re no &quot; baywatch , &quot; but --
remember &quot; baywatch &quot; ?
no , i do not .
oh . oh , man , you got to watch it .
you like lifeguards , like ...
hot ones ?
this has been a monumentally bad day
in a sea of bad days , so i &apos;m gonna need
to know who you are , what you &apos;re doing here ,
and how it relates to me ,
or i &apos;m gonna rip your throat out .
temper &apos;s gonna get you in trouble , damon .
it &apos;s already driven bonnie away how many times ?
oh , oh , oh , wait . i know . 13 .
you think my temper &apos;s bad with her ?
i like her .
you not so much .
ok . ok . sorry . seriously .
i &apos;m just kind of rusty
on the face @-@ to @-@ face type human interactions .
answers now .
maybe you should have a drink .
that usually calms you down .
thanks .
then makes you angry , then sad ,
then calm again .
it &apos;s a weird cycle , and look .
if you really want to know the reason i &apos;m following you ,
it &apos;s because i want to kill you .
vervain in your bourbon .
who didn &apos;t see that one coming ?
who buys patio furniture from a grocery store ?
i mean , somebody must .
otherwise , it--it wouldn &apos;t be here ,
but now i &apos;m a little unfamiliar with vampires ,
but from what i &apos;ve gathered ,
a stake in the heart should do it , right ?
you can always fight dirty , damon .
like that time you and bonnie played monopoly
and you stole from the bank .
not cool .
i &apos;m gonna rip your head off .
no . you &apos;re not .
i didn &apos;t know which bottle you &apos;d take ,
so i vervained them all .
stay away from him .
the useless one is here .
thank god .
i &apos;ve watched you try to do magic for months now .
what are you gonna do , fail at me ?
it &apos;s embarrassing .
i &apos;m embarrassed for you .
run .
phesmatos .
incendia .
ok . ok . ok .
giving up so soon ?
i &apos;m embarrassed for you .
sorry i called you the most annoying person in the world .
i hadn &apos;t met him yet .
was that always dented ?
what the hell does it matter ? it &apos;s a keg .
liv lent them to me man .
oh , is that when you lent liv your manhood ?
just lift the damn thing .
actually , don &apos;t .
i &apos;m in desperate need of an empty truck bed .
isn &apos;t this your friend jay ?
what the hell did you do ?
i avoided the stake he planned to fire at stefan and me .
stake ?
you didn &apos;t realize your friend was a vampire hunter ?
well , you do now .
no . no , no . that &apos;s not possible .
yes , it is ,
and as much as i &apos;d like to watch you
process what i &apos;m sure is a dreadful revelation ,
i need to bury the body .
get out of here .
stefan !
stop , ok ? i am sorry .
i did not know about ivy , but--
but what ? what ?
i was fooling myself ,
i was using her as an escape ?
yeah , i know what you think , caroline .
well , actually , i was gonna say ,
&quot; but killing enzo won &apos;t bring her back . &quot;
no , but it will stop him from reminding me of my brother .
i kill him , i can leave this place ,
and i can start over again .
so that &apos;s why you left all those messages on my phone ,
promising apologies .
that &apos;s why you visited elena ,
that &apos;s why you came to this party ,
just to kill enzo and start over ?
yep .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i know that a part of you misses this place
and these people , your friends .
i know that being back here reminds you how much we need you ,
how much ... i need you ,
but if i &apos;m wrong , then go ahead .
just go . start over ,
but , god , if i &apos;m right ,
if just a little part of you came back
to check on elena , who &apos;s had an unbearable 4 months ,
or alaric , who just came back from the dead ,
or me ...
if even just a small , little part of you came back to check on me ...
then stay .
hey . weren &apos;t you getting ice ?
i was till i realized how mean that girl was to me .
how ?
um , i have self @-@ respect .
it may have taken me till i was halfway to the sip and serve
to realize it , but i have it .
wait . halfway to the sip and serve ?
where is that specifically ?
i don &apos;t know . right around route 13 when you get into mystic falls .
sorry about your warm booze .
have you guys seen sarah ?
no . why ?
there &apos;s no ice .
i think you &apos;ll live , jer .
caroline compelled that girl to go get ice .
she didn &apos;t .
well , why not ? is she on vervain ?
no . she had to go into mystic falls to get it .
she had to cross the border .
compulsion is magic .
which means that every memory you compelled away
came back , so sarah , the girl you attacked and you compelled ...
knows what i am .
you &apos;re awake . good .
now for the q &amp; a portion of the evening .
let me guess . i answer right ,
i get a pork rind .
wrong , i get a poker .
what ? no , no , no .
these are for me .
you just get the poker .
yeah . you don &apos;t have to do that .
no ?
we &apos;re on the same team .
really ?
do you always try and kill your teammates ?
the important thing is that you have your magic back .
it worked .
what , you--you didn &apos;t really think i &apos;d kill damon , did you ?
in what universe does that make sense ?
who would kill 1 / 3 of our population ?
i &apos;m not a monster .
i knew bonnie would show up .
she always comes back , all 13 times ,
and i knew with the right motivation
she &apos;d be able to access her magic ,
although i @-@ i did get a little worried
with all your bickering that
damon &apos;s life wouldn &apos;t be enough motivation ,
but turns out it was .
i guess that &apos;s just how you two show your love .
so you did all that just to make sure i would have my magic ?
of course i did .
because your magic is the key to getting the hell out of here .
maybe this is an isolated thing .
jay could be working alone .
yeah . maybe jay , who i &apos;ve known since i was 10,
somehow became a vampire hunter on his own .
i &apos;m such an idiot .
i spent all summer training with a founding family member ,
thinking that he was only worried
about protecting old ladies from getting mugged .
because this is how i wanted to spend my saturday night .
load them up .
what the hell happened to your truck anyway ?
it &apos;s a little complicated .
i got this , dude .
i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
sad jocks are kind of like sad clowns ,
you know , pathetic but kind of hilarious .
not in the mood , liv .
uh @-@ oh . that sounded like a threat .
no . just a request .
is this what you want ?
you want to see my break ?
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just easier for me if you &apos;re an aggressive unlikable dick .
why ?
so i don &apos;t have to worry about falling for you .
i checked every room . sarah is gone ,
and it looks like she trashed the place .
oh , ok , ok .
well caroline and i will , uh ,
go out and search near the border then .
i &apos;ll keep looking in town .
i &apos;ll call you if i find anything .
so i was just gonna leave my clothes here
while we look , if that &apos;s ok .
yeah . of course .
i also was thinking that , you know ,
if there are vampire hunters on the loose
then living alone right by their home base
is probably not a good idea .
is this an official unpack ?
because your moving methods are just so confusing .
yes , this is an official unpack .
i &apos;m sorry i got mad at you earlier .
sometimes , it just seems like you have
this secret way to move on .
is this ...
bonnie &apos;s ?
yeah .
there you go .
you just discovered my secret to moving on .
sometimes , i don &apos;t .
i miss bonnie .
i miss mystic falls ,
i miss our old life ,
i miss ...
stefan ?
yeah . i miss stefan .
caroline ...
you and stefan ...
do you have feelings for him or something ?
yeah , i think maybe i did .
well , we should go ahead and find that girl
before she outs us .
rough night ?
ahh . nothing a piece of pie can &apos;t fix .
service would be lovely , though .
my fault . sorry .
i sent everyone home for the night .
can &apos;t have you killing any more of the wait staff .
consider being more discreet when you feed .
you never know whose eyes are watching .
i bet this normally works , doesn &apos;t it ?
knocks vampires right out .
see , i &apos;m a bit different than a normal vampire .
i can fight the vervain ,
not for long , but ...
long enough to take care of you .
i found this on one of your guys .
i think he killed him , though .
who are you ?
stefan salvatore .
you and i have something in common .
one of the founding families .
thank you .
actually ...
if you don &apos;t mind ,
i have my own way i like them to die .
just make sure it &apos;s painful .
