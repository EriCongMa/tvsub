would you pass the mustard ?
sure .
hey , want to hear a fun fact about mustard ?
is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavor
were evolved by the cabbage family
as a chemical defense against caterpillars ?
yeah .
well , that was fun .
good for you , leonard .
hey , there .
hey , you &apos;re early .
the movie doesn &apos;t start for an hour .
actually , we &apos;re not going to the movies .
we are here to kidnap you .
what are you talking about ?
well , you eloped and we didn &apos;t get a chance
to throw you a bachelor party ,
so there &apos;s a van downstairs
and we &apos;re here to take you
to a surprise location for the weekend .
well , i &apos;d hardly call this kidnapping .
where &apos;s the blindfold ?
where &apos;s the duct tape ?
where &apos;s the part where you call me and demand ransom
and i try to keep you on the phone ,
but you hang up seconds before i can trace it
and then i say , &quot; i &apos;m getting too old for this crud &quot; ?
when do we leave ?
right now .
yeah , penny packed you a bag .
wow , okay .
you &apos;re seriously going to get in a van
and let these two take you to an unknown destination
for an entire weekend ?
oh , not just him ; you &apos;re coming , too .
oh , and how do you think you &apos;re going to get me to do that ?
unhand me !
this is ridiculous !
i told you to put tape on his mouth !
and i told you he bit me !
it &apos;s bad enough i &apos;m being taken against my will .
i don &apos;t see why it has to be in
some hippie &apos;s mobile sex dungeon .
well , sheldon , there &apos;s something about this van
that you &apos;re going to find very interesting .
it runs on syphilis ?
this van was owned and driven by your personal
physics hero ...
richard feynman .
曾被评选为有史以来最伟大的物理学家之一
no .
yeah !
a buddy of mine let me borrow it .
this was feynman &apos;s van ?
that &apos;s so cool .
yeah , nothing &apos;s been changed since he drove it .
i bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy .
yeah , and talked about physics with them !
so , are you gonna give us a clue where we &apos;re headed ?
uh , okay , let &apos;s see ...
they &apos;ve got spicy food
and there &apos;s a chance you &apos;ll get diarrhea .
india .
we can drive there .
your house ?
we are going to meh @-@ he @-@ co !
fun , i &apos;ve never been there !
leonard , don &apos;t be fooled !
i &apos;m from texas--
meh @-@ he @-@ co is spanish for mexico .
what &apos;s wrong with mexico ?
uh , mariachi bands , wild dogs ,
beans that jump around &apos; cause there &apos;s a worm inside .
okay , calm down .
there &apos;s a theme to this weekend .
we are going to mexico in feynman &apos;s van
to stay at the vacation house feynman bought
with the money from his nobel prize .
viva la imodium !
come on , leonard &apos;s doing bachelor stuff .
you sure we can &apos;t take you to a strip club ?
nah , if i want to see a naked dancing man ,
i just flush the toilet while leonard &apos;s in the shower .
i know we &apos;re not making a fuss ,
but in the spirit of bachelorette parties ,
i made cookies in the shape of male genitals .
you really didn &apos;t have to ...
that is anatomic .
thank you .
the veins are gummy worms .
oh , look ,
jewish and gentile .
i had extra dough .
oh , that &apos;s leonard .
he said they &apos;re about to cross the border .
i hope the boys don &apos;t get too crazy in mexico .
oh , yeah , right . lock up your daughters
or sheldon might lecture them
about the north american free trade agreement .
boy , that was a long night for me .
according to this mexican customs web site ,
visitors may not bring more than five laser discs ,
20 compact discs
or 12 vhs tapes .
we don &apos;t have any of those .
how can you be sure ?
vhs was king when feynman drove this van .
for all we know , there are hidden compartments
lousy with jane fonda workout videos .
if there was a hidden compartment ,
don &apos;t you think you &apos;d be stuffed in it by now ?
are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations ?
you don &apos;t need a yellow fever shot to go to mexico .
you can never be too careful .
i got one last year before i went to epcot .
so , penny , how &apos;s married life ?
oh , it &apos;s good .
i just wish leonard would work up the courage
to tell sheldon he &apos;s moving in here .
you guys still aren &apos;t living together ?
we are . i mean , he sleeps here .
but it &apos;s only a matter of time
before sheldon has a bad dream
and tries to climb into bed with the leonard @-@ shaped pile of pillows .
speaking of sheldon ,
how &apos;s single life treating you ?
fine , i guess .
i &apos;ve been focusing on me .
i was thinking about changing my wardrobe .
yes !
good for you !
but then i decided i don &apos;t want to go changing who i am
just because of some man .
yes .
good for you .
you know , it is normal
to want to change your look after a breakup .
actually , i was thinking of making one small change .
your sweater ?
your glasses ?
your hair ?
your shoes !
piercing my ears .
you really never had that done ?
my mom said pierced ears were for whores ,
pirates and genies .
okay , well , you &apos;re a grown woman now .
i know , but sheldon had this clause
in the relationship agreement
forbidding cosmetic surgery
unless it &apos;s to look like a klingon .
we &apos;ll take you to the mall to get it done .
why ? i can do it right here .
really ?
you have a piercing gun ?
no .
all you need is a needle and an ice cube .
i &apos;ve done it , like , a dozen times .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
oh , come on . i &apos;ll be gentle .
let me take your ear virginity .
this party &apos;s weird .
hey , watch your speed .
i hear the mexican police target tourists .
oh , not a problem .
if anything goes down ,
we just put koothrappali in the driver &apos;s seat
and slap a sombrero on his head .
dude , how many races can you offend in a single breath ?
i don &apos;t know . have you watched the olympics with me ?
sheldon , can you believe that we &apos;re driving in a van that was owned by
one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century ?
it &apos;s like the batmobile .
if batman was real
and a physicist
and his car wasn &apos;t cool .
it is extraordinary .
perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us .
maybe between this and his beach house ,
we will be inspired to greatness .
i usually don &apos;t put too much stock in charms and talismans .
however , even i must admit
feeling richard feynman &apos;s butt dent
cupping my own bottom ...
that does get the creative juices flowing .
hey , i have to return this van .
keep your creative juices in your pants .
what was that ?
i think it &apos;s a tire .
what if it &apos;s banditos shooting at us ?
what if we get kidnapped ?
what if we end up in a factory making bart simpson pinatas
for the rest of our lives ? !
在节庆或生日是挂空中 让人击打
it &apos;s the tire .
leonard ?
what ?
i am getting too old for this crud .
amy , i noticed your status still says
&quot; in a relationship &quot; on facebook .
you &apos;re right .
i should probably let all of my facebook friends know .
penny , i &apos;m no longer in a relationship .
did you change yours to &quot; married &quot; yet ?
uh , no , not yet .
there &apos;s still a few people i haven &apos;t told personally .
who ?
oh , just my parents
and my entire family .
what ?
why ?
well , i don &apos;t want to hurt my dad .
you know , he always wanted
to dance with his daughter at her wedding .
what about your sister &apos;s wedding ?
they started to , then her water broke .
you know , if he finds out we eloped ,
it &apos;s gonna break his heart .
how long do you think you can keep it from him ?
yeah , isn &apos;t it gonna get worse the longer you wait ?
well , not necessarily .
you know , dad &apos;s not getting any younger ,
so if i wait long enough ,
i &apos;ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle
and it was magical .
when did you learn how to change a tire ?
every self @-@ respecting gentleman should know how
in case he comes across a damsel in distress
by the side of the road .
if i see one scorpion ,
i am getting on someone &apos;s shoulders
and never coming down .
and there &apos;s your damsel .
wow , this one &apos;s really stuck .
are you turning it the right way ?
no .
i took the other four off
and when i got to this one , i thought ,
&quot; you know , i &apos;m in a rut . let &apos;s shake things up . &quot;
here , let me try .
you &apos;re right , it doesn &apos;t turn the other way .
there you go . you &apos;re all done !
that wasn &apos;t so bad .
nice .
boy , if my mom could see me now ,
she &apos;d lock me in the sin closet .
that &apos;s a joke , right ?
actually , the joke was on her .
i could still see the tv through the slats .
i &apos;m starting to see why you and your mom aren &apos;t very close .
bet she &apos;d still tell her if she got married .
you &apos;re not gonna let this go , are you ?
well , it &apos;s kind of sad that they don &apos;t know .
i mean , they love leonard .
fine , you want me to call ?
i &apos;ll call .
why am i so nervous ?
it &apos;s understandable .
amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with sheldon .
yeah ? how did it go ?
did she make you crawl into the breaking @-@ up drawer ?
uh , well , actually , to be honest ...
i @-@ i haven &apos;t told her yet .
you &apos;ve been giving me a hard time
and you haven &apos;t even told your mom about sheldon ?
i &apos;m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
fine . i &apos;m calling home ,
but when i &apos;m done , you &apos;re calling your mother .
easy for you to say .
you never had to watch 60 minutes like this .
hey , daddy .
hey , slugger .
how &apos;s my girl ?
uh , good . is mom around ?
ah , she took your brother out to celebrate .
he just got his tenth one @-@ month sober chip .
yeah , she &apos;s gonna make him a little necklace .
okay , i &apos;ll talk to her later .
uh , dad , there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
leonard and i got married .
you did ?
when ?
last week . i &apos;m sorry , i should &apos;ve told you .
it was a spur of the moment thing .
i feel terrible .
please don &apos;t be too disappointed .
are you happy ?
very .
leonard is so great .
well , then i &apos;m happy for you .
aw , thank you , daddy .
that means so much .
well , i understand it &apos;s hard to tell someone something
if you think it &apos;s gonna upset &apos; em .
it is .
you &apos;re the best dad ever .
yeah . uh , hold that thought .
i &apos;ve been sitting on a little news myself .
well , what is it ?
you know that rototiller i got for the tractor ?
no .
oh , you should see it .
it is a beautiful piece of machinery .
anyway , uh ...
i backed over your pet pig with it .
moondance ?
yeah , he &apos;s , uh , not dancing anymore .
you killed my pig ?
i did not kill him .
the vet took care of that .
when ?
oh ... ten , 12 months ago .
you didn &apos;t tell me for a year ? !
well , apple doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree , does it ?
love ya , slugger . gotta go !
okay , amy , your turn .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s called lamaze breathing .
it helps you push .
great .
he &apos;s pushing with his uterus .
there &apos;s got to be a smarter way of removing it .
yeah , this is nothing more than a physics problem .
right .
archimedes once said ,
&quot; give me a leever long enough
and a fulcrum on which to place it ,
and i shall move the world . &quot;
of course .
all we need is to find stuff
to make a leever big enough to fix this .
exactly .
i &apos;ll bet there &apos;s something around here
that could be a lehver .
let &apos;s see , a lehver , a lehver ...
everybody hold on !
let &apos;s take this problem one step at a time .
first , we need to decide
whether we &apos;re calling it leever or lehver .
and the sooner we decide it &apos;s leever ,
the sooner we can roll up our sleeves-- not slehves--
and get to work .
we &apos;re gonna be here &quot; foreever . &quot;
thanks a lot , guys .
what did we do ?
before i made that call ,
my pig was alive and happy
and rolling around in the mud .
now he &apos;s illegally buried in our backyard
next to my great @-@ grandmother .
really ? they didn &apos;t eat him ?
no .
he was a beloved member of the family .
the breakfast meat family ?
it &apos;s not funny .
you &apos;re up . call your mother .
oh , maybe later .
your pig dying made me sad .
and a little hungry .
phone , now .
okay . okay .
fine .
hi , mom .
try dialing .
you saw that , huh ?
hi , mom . how are you doing ?
oh , good .
how &apos;s work ?
that &apos;s nice .
i &apos;m fine .
hey , listen , i &apos;ve been meaning to ask ,
how come aunt doe and aunt florence never got along ?
okay , just ... give me that .
amy broke up with sheldon ,
she got her ears pierced
and she made us eat penis cookies !
hang on .
she wants to talk to you .
i don &apos;t think the lever &apos;s working .
what makes you say that ?
there &apos;s gotta be something else we can try .
if this was star trek ,
we could use a phaser to blast it off .
no , it &apos;s too broad of a beam .
you &apos;d need something more precise ,
like superman &apos;s heat vision .
ooh , the green lantern &apos;s ring
could make a big green hand that unscrews it .
if you need a green hand ,
why not just use the hulk ?
oh , please ,
the hulk would never get across the border with that temper .
guys , excuse me ,
not that calling one of the avengers
isn &apos;t a perfectly reasonable choice ,
but we &apos;re scientists .
don &apos;t you think we can figure this out using actual science ?
yes , we could use science .
but it &apos;s your bachelor party .
lighten up .
* we will *
* we will percussive shock you *
* we will *
* we will percussive shock you *
* buddy you &apos;re a boy *
* make a big noise playin &apos; in the street
* gonna be a big man someday *
* you got mud on your face , you big disgrace *
* kickin &apos; your can all over the place . *
i have an eidetic memory .
sometimes it &apos;s a curse .
i had no idea
tortilla chips were such a good fuel source .
they &apos;re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat .
let &apos;s hope the lug nut expands .
what if that burning food attracts animals ?
we have plenty of food for the animals .
we do ?
yep .
a six @-@ foot wiener in a flash t @-@ shirt .
that &apos;s not very nice .
it &apos;s a bachelor party . lighten up .
what is that awful smell ?
it &apos;s burning salsa .
i &apos;m hoping the acidity and salinity
combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off .
what an innovative solution .
perhaps i don &apos;t give your mit education enough credit .
yeah , i saw it on mythbusters .
all right , this rust ,
combined with the aluminum recovered from the van ,
is now thermite .
great .
couple pinches ought to do the trick .
is that enough to melt the lug nut ?
well , let &apos;s start small .
we can always add more .
you put up a good fight , lug nut ,
but you &apos;ve met your match .
hey , look !
the lug nut &apos;s off .
what are you doing back ?
we got a flat
and couldn &apos;t get the tire off .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
if it makes you feel any better ,
i pierced amy &apos;s ears
and her mom made her sit in my closet .
we blew up feynman &apos;s van .
my dad killed my pig with his tractor .
i spent the night in mexico with sheldon .
you win .
