for over a century , i have lived in secret .
until now . i know the risk .
but i have to know her .
the original johnathan gilbert had an invention
that was stolen by a vampire .
her name was pearl .
i gave your device to damon .
why don &apos;t you ask him for it yourself ?
mom ! mama !
my wife isobel spent her life
researching paranormal activity in this area .
what have you done to my wife ?
i turned her .
why do i look like her ?
you were adopted .
this girl showed up ,
16 and about to give birth .
what else do you know about her ?
just her name ... isobel .
stop looking .
she doesn &apos;t want to know you .
she &apos;s alive ? does that mean she &apos;s a ...
hello , rick .
isobel .
it &apos;s good to see you .
you look good .
i hear that you &apos;re a high @-@ school history teacher ?
how ... how is that ?
where have you been , isobel ?
i don &apos;t have any reasons that are gonna comfort you .
i don &apos;t have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you .
i wanted this .
it &apos;s that simple ?
yeah .
you were supposed to mourn me and move on .
you were my wife .
and i loved you .
how could i not search for you ?
because i wasn &apos;t lost , rick .
i understand that you know my daughter elena .
and i hear that she &apos;s been looking for me .
so ...
i want you to arrange for a meeting with us .
you want me ...
to deliver a message ?
yeah .
screw you ...
you selfish bitch .
what do you want from me ?
i told you .
i &apos;m not gonna do anything for you .
you better tell elena that i want to meet ,
or i &apos;m gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one ,
and i &apos;m gonna start with your history students .
got it ?
i &apos;m supposed to help build the miss mystic float
for the founder &apos;s day parade .
if i don &apos;t , i get the wrath of caroline .
but i wanted to check in first .
well , i &apos;m doing great . thanks for asking .
i &apos;m checking on stefan .
oh , him ?
oh . he &apos;s ... he &apos;s terrible .
what &apos;s the matter ?
he &apos;s just back to boring ,
strait @-@ laced , off the junk .
you &apos;ve successfully cured him of
anything that was interesting about his personality .
don &apos;t forget who helped me .
i hate myself .
hey , did uncle john mention anything to you
about my field trip with the history teacher ?
no , i &apos;ve still been avoiding him .
why ? what &apos;s he up to ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i &apos;d love it if you could find out for me .
i gotta go . i &apos;m late .
have fun with the mystic queen .
i know i did .
elena called .
these are the specs
for the history department &apos;s founder &apos;s day float .
we &apos;re gonna be recreating the battle of willow creek .
tyler &apos;s been nominated head of the production design .
by who ?
by me .
i &apos;ve seen your sketches , and they &apos;re good .
look , i &apos;m not really into the whole ...
yeah , well , you just pick your team , be creative , and ...
and don &apos;t screw up .
great .
you want to help me out with this ?
not really , no .
hey , mr. saltzman .
come with me .
we need to talk .
all right . show me .
let &apos;s reference last year &apos;s miss mystic float .
this is what they did last year .
and it &apos;s exactly what we don &apos;t want to do .
ok . so , what are we doing ?
southern classic elegance .
&quot; gone with the wind &quot; ?
how did you know ?
you channel scarlett daily .
so true . yeah .
uhh . where &apos;s elena ? she &apos;s supposed to be helping .
i don &apos;t know .
ok , what &apos;s the deal ?
what do you mean ?
don &apos;t play dumb .
you and elena are fighting . spill .
it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s not nothing .
you know , this whole float
is supposed to be about friends creating something together ,
and everyone is fighting .
matt and tyler hate each other .
you and elena are on the outs .
i ... i don &apos;t like it .
and i can &apos;t fix it if i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong .
i can &apos;t talk about it , caroline . i &apos;m sorry .
damon . thanks for coming .
sorry i &apos;m late . the dog ate my , uh ...
never mind .
what &apos;s all the furrowed brows ?
i saw isobel last night .
isobel &apos;s here ? in town ?
you &apos;re late .
i didn &apos;t realize there was a schedule .
what &apos;s with the side show ?
cherie is a little jazz singer
that i picked up in a blues bar in brooklyn .
and i got the cowboy
at a gay rodeo in amarillo .
he &apos;s gay ?
not right now .
he &apos;s very good to me .
hey , cherie ?
i &apos;m teaching them french .
ooh . i can smell the judgment coming off of you .
well , they &apos;re people , isobel ,
and you &apos;re treating them like they &apos;re dolls .
if we &apos;re gonna be partners ,
you really have to stop being such a hater .
we &apos;re in a partnership together because we share a mutual goal .
don &apos;t ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle .
my lifestyle ?
so , i assume that you still don &apos;t have the invention .
i &apos;ll get it . i said i would .
uh , you threatened to expose damon salvatore .
that didn &apos;t work .
you killed that pearl lady .
still no invention .
i really don &apos;t think that your plan is working , john .
well , you being here isn &apos;t going to help anything .
you failed , john . i &apos;m gonna take it from here .
did you ask about uncle john ?
are they working together ?
no .
no , they &apos;re not ?
no , i didn &apos;t ask .
what about the invention ?
didn &apos;t ask .
does she know about the tomb of vampires ?
i don &apos;t know .
did words completely escape you ?
no , i was a little too distracted
by my dead vampire wife to ask any questions .
what did she want ?
she wants to see me , damon .
alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting .
we don &apos;t know why or what she wants .
you don &apos;t have to see her if you don &apos;t want to .
i don &apos;t really have a choice .
she &apos;s threatened to go on a killing spree .
i take it that &apos;s ... not ok with you guys .
i want to do it . i want to meet her .
if i don &apos;t , i know i &apos;ll regret it .
thanks .
can you hear me ?
thanks for coming .
i &apos;m nervous .
but i &apos;m happy that you &apos;re here .
love you .
hello , elena .
you look just like her . it &apos;s eerie .
you &apos;ve met katherine ?
she found me after i turned .
genetic curiosity , i suppose .
she would be fascinated by you .
is that how you can walk in the day ?
katherine helped me obtain it .
who &apos;s my father ?
not important . he was a teenage waste of space .
a name would be nice .
it would , wouldn &apos;t it ?
you ask a lot of questions .
why did you compel that man to kill himself
right after he told me to stop looking for you ?
traumatic impact . wish it would have been more effective .
human life means that little to you ?
means nothing to me .
it &apos;s just part of being what i am .
no . it &apos;s not .
i know other vampires . that &apos;s not true .
your boyfriend over there by the pool table ?
stefan salvatore .
why stefan ? why didn &apos;t you go for damon ?
or do enjoy them both ? like katherine did ?
we should be in there .
no . isobel made it clear
we &apos;re not to step foot inside .
i &apos;m not gonna kill her in a crowded restaurant .
you &apos;re not gonna kill her , period .
she ruined your life , and you still want to protect her ?
she &apos;s my wife .
was ... was my wife .
i looked for the woman i married , but she wasn &apos;t there .
whoever that it is ...
cold and detached .
she &apos;s given up her humanity .
yeah , see , i don &apos;t get that .
stefan has his humanity . he &apos;s a good guy .
oh , you &apos;re a dick and you kill people ,
but i still see something human in you .
but with her , there was ... there was nothing .
you can turn it off ...
like a button you can press . i mean , stefan &apos;s different .
he ... he wants the whole human experience .
he wants to feel every episode of &quot; how i met your mother , &quot;
so he shuts his feelings out .
the problem is , as a vampire , your instinct is not to feel .
isobel chose the easier road ...
no guilt and shame ...
no regret . i mean , come on .
if you could turn it off , wouldn &apos;t you ?
you haven &apos;t .
heh . of course i have , rick .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m so fun to be around .
why did you want to meet me ?
it can &apos;t be to just catch up .
because i &apos;m curious about you .
but the real reason is
i want what your uncle wants
johnathan gilbert &apos;s invention .
how do you know my uncle ?
i used to spend a lot of time here when i was younger .
john had a crush on me for years .
he was the first one that told me about vampires .
so , what made you want to be one ?
it &apos;s a very long list of reasons , elena ,
all of which i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve thought about .
that was your first lie .
it &apos;s inevitable . you &apos;re gonna get old .
stefan won &apos;t .
forever doesn &apos;t last very long when you &apos;re human .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but i don &apos;t have what you &apos;re looking for .
sit down .
and tell your boyfriend to walk away .
i want the invention .
i don &apos;t have it .
i know that .
but damon does .
and you &apos;re gonna get it for me .
he &apos;s not gonna give it to me .
then the blood will be on your hands .
it was nice meeting you , elena .
hey , anna . uh , where are you ?
what &apos;s up ? uh ...
give me a call when you get this .
how is anna ?
i like that girl . she has fire .
uh , i ... i don &apos;t know .
she won &apos;t return my calls .
girl trouble ?
no , no trouble .
anna just owes me a call . that &apos;s it .
is it the girl that i saw you with at the founder &apos;s pageant ?
you two are gettin &apos; pretty hot and heavy , huh ?
when was the last time you saw her ?
why ?
i &apos;m just making conversation .
no one else in this house likes me .
at least i can talk to you ,
especially if you need someone to talk to about girls .
ugh . please . i &apos;m eating .
so , seriously , how well do you know anna ?
i know anna extremely well .
well , know that you can talk to me about anything .
i &apos;m here to answer any questions that you have .
i &apos;ll help you in any way i can .
why ?
&apos;cause your dad would want me to .
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m good .
uh @-@ oh , cherie .
you won again . hope i &apos;m wearing my good underwear .
it &apos;s just one blast from the past after another .
no , no , no .
dig up.cherie.
it &apos;s good to see you , isobel .
i was just having fun with your naughty little minion .
how &apos;d you find me ?
searched all the neighborhood bank @-@ owned foreclosures
and found the most expensive one .
oh , i should have known .
you were the one who taught me that .
what are you really doing here ?
well , you caused quite a stir when you blew into town .
oh . so , everyone except for me you would have hurt .
i &apos;m so sorry .
did you bring the device ?
what are you doing with john gilbert ?
we dated a few times when we were young .
he was a little bit in love with me .
i &apos;m sure one of the many .
you know , this little invention , what do you want with it ?
oh , me personally ?
i don &apos;t want anything with it .
i &apos;m just doing what i &apos;m told .
you know , damon , we &apos;re on the same side
oh , yeah ? which side is that ?
katherine &apos;s .
she wants john gilbert to have the device .
and i think that you know that she &apos;s not happy
when she doesn &apos;t get what she wants .
why are you doing her dirty work ?
don &apos;t kill the messenger .
we both know that you can &apos;t control katherine .
she does what she wants .
so do i.
oh , really , damon ? you do ?
what should we do now ?
now that i have your attention , listen up .
you do not come into my town , threaten people i care about .
going after elena ... bad move .
you leave her alone , or i will rip you to bits ,
because i do believe in killing the messenger .
you know why ?
because it sends a message .
katherine wants something from me ,
you tell that little bitch to come get it herself .
i couldn &apos;t sleep last night .
you were obviously upset about something ,
and i just walked away .
that &apos;s not me .
that can &apos;t be us .
you &apos;re my friend , elena .
if you need me , i &apos;m here for you .
and i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t show you that yesterday .
i met my birth mother .
was it ...
are you ok ?
hey , man .
yeah ?
so , caroline tells me
you &apos;ve been on your own the past 2 weeks .
is everything ok ?
you &apos;re asking me about my mom . seriously ?
look , man , why don &apos;t i just have her give you
a call when she walks back through town ?
dude ...
that &apos;s not what i meant .
ok ? i &apos;m just trying to ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
well , good , man . don &apos;t say anything ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re a dick . end of story .
i know ...
whatever .
thanks for meeting me .
i wanted you to see this .
is that emily &apos;s spell book ?
i &apos;ve been going through it since grams died .
check this out .
that &apos;s the vampire compass .
yeah . according to emily , johnathan gilbert
never actually succeeded in inventing anything .
emily secretly spelled them all with magic
compass ...
rings ...
and the mystery device you told me about .
yeah , that &apos;s it
well , part of it . damon only has the one piece .
emily pledged her loyalty to katherine .
but she couldn &apos;t stand by and watch innocent people get killed .
this was the only way she could think of to help ...
to let johnathan gilbert believe he &apos;d
actually invented these devices .
does it say what it does ?
are you sure this is what isobel wants ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure . why ?
this is a weapon ...
against vampires .
elena !
hey . um ... have you seen stefan ?
i need to find him .
no , not lately . listen . um , you have a second ?
uh , yeah . what &apos;s up ? what &apos;s going on ?
well , it &apos;s anna . i left her all these messages ,
and she hasn &apos;t gotten back to me ... not even a text .
anna ?
i didn &apos;t know that you guys were still friends .
we &apos;re more than friends .
look , something could be seriously wrong .
and if you know anything , you gotta tell me .
i haven &apos;t talked to her , jer .
are you lying to me right now ?
why would you say that ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s what you do , elena . you lie .
you lie about everything .
i know what anna is .
and i know that you know .
so , tell me .
do you have any idea where she is ?
no .
but jer ...
jeremy . wait .
jeremy !
isobel .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m your mother , elena .
i want to be more involved in your life .
i don &apos;t want you in my life .
i understand that .
you already have a lot of people that you care about .
but i &apos;ve been studying .
let &apos;s see if i got this right .
there is the witchy best friend bonnie .
gonna stay away from that one .
sad little brother jeremy .
and there &apos;s caroline ...
obnoxious caroline .
i got all of my info from her , by the way .
she had no idea who i was , and she wouldn &apos;t stop yapping .
there &apos;s matt ...
friend , ex , yappy &apos;s future ex .
lots of connections there .
matt &apos;s not involved with us .
he &apos;s involved with you . isn &apos;t he ?
look , you shouldn &apos;t be here .
you need to leave .
no .
i have some friends here , too . look .
see that man over there standing next to matt by the float ?
his name &apos;s frank . he &apos;s very handsome .
and he &apos;s also very handy .
and he noticed that the axle was kind of rusted ,
which is very dangerous . so , all you have to do
is apply a little bit of pressure , and ...
no !
hey , get this trailer up !
come on , guys ,
lift it up , please !
give me a hand !
come on , lift .
come on !
call for help .
ok .
why are you doing this ?
i &apos;m showing you how easy it is
to hurt the people that you care about .
you &apos;re doing this just because of
johnathan gilbert &apos;s invention ?
hand it over and the fun will stop .
i told you , damon &apos;s not gonna give it to me .
and i think that you underestimate
how much damon cares about you .
he &apos;ll kill you before he gives it up .
is that before or after
i kill your brother jeremy ?
jeremy ?
jeremy !
the ambulance is saying 15 @-@ 20 minutes .
i have my car . i can take him to the hospital .
caroline can take me .
i didn &apos;t drive .
then i &apos;ll wait . it &apos;s fine .
you will not wait ! ok , you need to see a doctor .
tyler &apos;s driving . end of story .
go !
i &apos;ll bring my car around .
i see you &apos;re packing . that &apos;s a good sign .
won &apos;t be long now .
did you get the missing piece ? where is it ?
i don &apos;t have it yet .
then why did you call me here ?
&apos;cause i have the next best thing .
what the hell are you doing ?
getting what i want .
yeah , but he &apos;s my nephew .
and you &apos;re gonna let him go right this second .
the gaudy ring on your finger ...
it comes off .
come on .
come on , isobel . i ... i know you .
ok ?
it &apos;s me , john . you can &apos;t hurt a kid .
i &apos;ll kill him to prove you wrong .
really ?
are you that far gone ?
look , i know you &apos;ve changed .
ok ? but the old isobel is in there somewhere still .
isn &apos;t she ?
come on . let him go .
ok .
ok .
nice try .
we &apos;ll see how you do without this .
where &apos;s the device ?
damon has it .
he &apos;s gonna be difficult to reason with .
then we &apos;ll ... we &apos;ll go go him . i &apos;ll talk to him .
he &apos;s not just gonna hand it over ,
pecially if it &apos;s harmful to vampires .
what if it &apos;s not ?
absolutely not .
just hear me out .
i &apos;m not gonna give the device to isobel
so she can give it to john who &apos;s gonna turn around and kill me .
i like being a living dead person .
but it &apos;ll be useless . bonnie can take its power away .
i don &apos;t trust her .
i can remove the original spell .
john and isobel will never know .
no .
i will get jeremy out on my way
really ? how are you gonna do that ?
because isobel is a vampire ,
and jeremy can be dead the second you walk in the door .
are you even up for this ? i mean , no offense .
you &apos;re no emily bennett .
emily knew what she was doing .
i &apos;ve been practicing .
it &apos;s not piano lessons , honey .
what &apos;s your favorite book ?
what ?
name a book ,
any book .
name a book .
how about ...
&quot; call of the wild , &quot; jack london ?
jack london .
great parlor trick .
we &apos;re doing this , damon .
and we &apos;re gonna do it my way .
now , give me the device .
we &apos;re wasting time .
i don &apos;t trust you . i tried to kill you .
hmm . you &apos;re right . you can &apos;t trust me .
but you can trust me .
thank you .
what is she after ?
your ancestor invented a weapon ...
a device that &apos;s extremely harmful to vampires .
we &apos;ve been trying to get it .
why ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s a group of vampires from a long time ago
that wants revenge on this town .
but why ...
why would a vampire help you kill other vampires ?
she has her own reasons for wanting them dead .
look , jeremy ,
no one ever thought vampires would return to this town ...
not in modern times .
but they have .
and we have to destroy them .
all of them ?
no ... there are some good ones out there .
there &apos;s no such thing .
i don &apos;t believe that .
well , your dad did .
and as his son , that should mean something to you .
how did my father know about all this ?
who do you think taught me about the family history ?
done .
great .
now what ?
now we give it to isobel .
where &apos;s the device ?
where &apos;s my brother ?
this isn &apos;t a negotiation .
where &apos;s the invention ?
where is my brother ?
do you really think that i came alone ?
do you really think that i came alone ?
for god sakes , call home .
what ?
call home , ask to speak to your brother jeremy .
hello ?
jeremy . are you ok ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m fine .
uncle john , uh , hit his head .
it was an accident .
and we &apos;re all laughing .
yeah , but , um , i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;ll be home soon , all right ?
yeah .
you were never going to hurt him .
no . i was going to kill him .
don &apos;t look for any redeeming qualities in me .
i don &apos;t have any .
but you took a risk with damon .
how did you know that he was going to give it to me ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s in love with you .
thank you .
for what ?
for being such a monumental disappointment .
it keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact .
good @-@ bye , elena .
as long as you have a salvatore on each arm ,
you &apos;re doomed .
katherine was smart .
she got out .
but we all know that you &apos;re not katherine .
hey , it &apos;s anna . leave a message .
jeremy , we have to talk about this .
no , we really don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know what anna told you ,
but there are things that you need to know .
yeah ?
because ...
i &apos;m pretty sure that your journal covered it .
you read my journal ?
and save me the speech about invasion of privacy ,
because i read a section about damon erasing my memory ,
about what happened to vicki .
jeremy , please , you don &apos;t understand .
the night that vicki died ,
it was like mom and dad died all over again .
it was all over your face .
and it hurt so much to see you like that .
i just wanted to take away your pain ,
i &apos;m so sorry .
just get out .
no , jeremy ...
elena !
just get out .
please .
jer , i ...
what do you want ?
i totally get it .
you here as a history teacher .
it &apos;s good .
what the hell are you doing ?
you act like you don &apos;t care ,
and yet here you are hunting me down .
i &apos;m leaving .
i just thought i &apos;d say good @-@ bye .
well , you couldn &apos;t be bothered the first time ,
so why now ?
you hate me , good .
does that make it easier for you ?
i mean , what is the whole point of this exercise ?
what did you expect ?
you spent all this time trying to track me down .
what did you think you would find ?
the woman who gave me this ...
i mean , you act like you don &apos;t care .
but you cared enough to protect me after you left .
i was a different person back then .
right , right , right .
and that person is gone .
the woman i married , the woman i loved , she &apos;s just ... she &apos;s gone .
you expect me to believe that ?
what are you doing ?
well , i &apos;m ring @-@ free .
i &apos;m vervain @-@ free ,
so either kill me or compel me ,
because ...
i don &apos;t believe it .
not for a second .
i wanted this .
i needed this .
and i &apos;m going to regret it forever .
this was my mistake .
not yours .
you are not going to remember this .
i loved you .
i did .
and when i think about what i gave up , it hurts .
but now , your heart &apos;s free of me .
it &apos;s easier this way .
good @-@ bye , ric .
anna ? hey , what are you doing here ?
my mother .
she &apos;s dead .
what ?
she was killed .
oh , my god , anna ...
hey , i &apos;m so sorry .
i know i &apos;m not supposed to be here ,
but i don &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
hey , it &apos;s ok .
would you like one ?
say it .
whatever it is , purge , get it out .
it &apos;s about what isobel said .
what about it ?
well , i know that you and elena bonded ,
and i know that she cares about you , and , uh ,
i know you care about her .
well , this is going in an interesting direction .
i &apos;m just concerned about elena being hurt .
she considers you a friend .
same here . elena &apos;s a very good friend .
actually , she might qualify as my only friend .
is that a problem ?
so , at the risk of sounding like a , um ,
like a jealous boyfriend ...
oh , there &apos;s no risk .
you do .
history will not be repeating itself ,
where elena &apos;s concerned .
do you understand what i &apos;m saying ?
sure ... sure .
do you ... understand ?
hey , whatever you say , man .
i mean , honestly , we &apos;re just friends .
and as her friend , i wasn &apos;t looking forward
to telling her the truth , anyway .
so , i &apos;ll let you do it .
what truth ?
about john .
&apos;cause i know you guys don &apos;t like
to keep secrets from each other .
what are you talking about ?
am i the only one around here
who has the ability to put two and two together ?
isobel . hello ?
she dated john when she was 15 .
she gets pregnant ,
and ends up at the doctor &apos;s office of john &apos;s brother .
now , what do you think is john &apos;s role is in all of this , huh ?
i mean , go ahead , think about it . i &apos;ll wait .
you get it ? you there yet ? hmm ?
so , you think that
john is elena &apos;s father ?
what proof do you have ?
i don &apos;t need any proof . that &apos;s the dna test for
john and elena , and more approaches to do it .
but i know how well you deal with these big bombshells , so ...
sleep tight .
oh , and when you do tell elena ,
and she needs a friend to talk to about anything ...
i &apos;m here for her .
hello ?
on your doorstep , you &apos;ll find what you &apos;ve been looking for .
and my ring ?
don &apos;t screw this up .
you know you have to do , john .
i got it .
i won &apos;t fail .
you better not .
katherine wants all of those tomb vampires dead .
and i want to add two more to that list .
let me guess .
stefan and damon .
i don &apos;t want this life for her .
well , it was always a part of the plan ,
consider them gone .
she &apos;s our daughter , john .
we owe that to her .
i know .
so you &apos;re not going to tell me what happened ?
i did something bad , caroline .
and i lied about it .
to who ?
to elena .
i pretended to do something
i didn &apos;t really do .
what are you talking about ?
i couldn &apos;t do what she wanted me to do .
it wasn &apos;t right .
grams would have never done it ,
so i couldn &apos;t , either .
but when elena finds out ...
