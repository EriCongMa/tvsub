why do i still have to come to these family meetings ?
i &apos;m an adult .
she said , emerging from the basement
in her pajamas at noon .
get off my back . it &apos;s saturday .
right ?
what is this meeting about ?
are the ducks back ? cause that was weird .
they saved us .
from people thinking we &apos;re normal .
your mom starts her new job
running grandpa &apos;s closet company on monday ,
and you know how she gets when there are big changes .
knockity @-@ knock !
oh , no . not --
mrs. clutterworth .
who &apos;s ready to take everything we don &apos;t want
and toss it in the bin ?
i am !
you get her arms , i &apos;ll get her legs .
i created mrs. clutterworth
when the kids were little
as a way to make home organizing fun .
so fun . super fun .
maybe a little confusing .
why ?
well , the name is clearly inspired
by mrs. butterworth , right ?
but somehow she has a british accent .
yeah , well , the kids were super into mary poppins back then .
still missing a step .
take one of these things up to your rooms .
put everything in it you don &apos;t use .
can &apos;t we just do this next weekend , or , like , never ?
no .
i am starting my new job
and i want to leave things as organized as possible .
most people just throw stuff into a closet .
as president of a closet company ,
you should know that .
we &apos;re doing this .
or , more to the point , if ...
* there &apos;s something that you have *
* and you never , ever use it *
* put it in the bin *
* lose it , lose it , lose it *
oh , i think you &apos;ve lost it , lost it , lost it .
i &apos;d like to toast my dad on his first day of retirement .
congratulations on 42 years in the closet ...
business .
i think what i &apos;m going to miss the most
is all the closet jokes .
traditionally on an occasion this emotionally significant ,
the man of the hour delivers a few well @-@ chosen words .
i would just like to say ...
i &apos;m going golfing .
dad , don &apos;t forget lily &apos;s first flute recital
is on thursday at 3 : 30 .
i would love to be there ,
but i &apos;m really swamped at wo--
hell , that snuck up on me .
it &apos;s okay , grandpa . i don &apos;t want you to come .
i stink .
hey , no . no .
you do not stink .
i don &apos;t know why she &apos;s so bad .
she has a great teacher .
i was a brilliant flautist--
may have won best new soloist
at the lower ventura jazz happening .
i used to keep my trophy in my locker .
i &apos;d stare at it every time the jealous kids
would stuff me in there .
hey , have fun today .
nice face candy .
the aviators .
you &apos;re gonna be the coolest guy on the golf course .
hey , come here .
i &apos;m dying to tell somebody .
can i let you in on a little secret ?
a secret ? just you and me ?
sorry , that had to come out . go on .
i &apos;m not going golfing .
i &apos;m taking my first flying lessons today .
i always dreamed of being a pilot .
oh , jay , that &apos;s fantastic , and i @-@ i totally get it .
i had a crush on the pilot
who flew the crop duster back home .
he had big , broad shoulders and a deep , husky voice
that , in retrospect , could have been pesticide @-@ related .
don &apos;t tell anyone , especially gloria .
i want it to be a surprise .
not a word .
i &apos;m your man .
you &apos;re wearing a purse .
this is a gentleman &apos;s tactical tote .
and i &apos;ll have you know ,
this exact model was carried by a member of seal team 6 .
yes , while his girlfriend tried on dresses .
knockity @-@ knock !
what the hell are you doing ?
getting salon @-@ quality haircuts at a fraction of the price !
thanks , flowbee !
come on , guys .
have you gotten rid of anything today ?
yeah , all that .
that &apos;s one sock .
oh , my goodness .
what in the world were we thinking ?
hey , gorgeous ! gimme a kiss !
i do not want luke &apos;s dirty sock anywhere near my mouth .
it &apos;s seen worse .
no . oh , no .
come on , guys . stay focused .
i can &apos;t be the only one getting rid of stuff today .
wait a minute . what is chickie doing in there ?
it &apos;s broken .
but every year when the kids were little
he was the star of easter !
i mean , besides jesus .
when you squeeze it , it says ,
&quot; happy easter ! &quot;
now when you squeeze him , he says ,
&quot; battery acid is leaking inside of me . let me die ! &quot;
later .
she just took my favorite stick .
you need to control your woman .
that is your mother you &apos;re talking about ...
so that &apos;s not happening .
i love chickie .
i love all of that stuff !
and i have a plan to get it back .
but maybe we &apos;ll let the flowbee go .
all right .
manny , as requested ,
a few of my favorite clown props .
what &apos;s wrong , manny , you have too many friends ?
don &apos;t listen to him .
i volunteered to perform at joe &apos;s school fair .
i &apos;m closing the show .
well , at least you know that going in .
okay , snakes in a can ,
endless handkerchief ,
it will keep coming out of there if you keep pulling it .
and , of course , the squirting flower .
thank you so much .
before you take these from me ,
would you like a small glass of water ?
is that a dribble glass ?
you &apos;re ready .
i think i &apos;ll pass on the fake peanut brittle , though .
it &apos;s not even fooling preschoolers .
okay , maybe .
oh , hello , gloria .
thank you for brunch .
it was ... revolutionary .
yes . goodbye .
tough room .
no , no . your bowtie is very funny
because it was spinning around ,
but i just can &apos;t stop thinking about
this terrible dream that i had last night .
oh , what was it ?
it was about jay .
he was falling from a great height ,
and you both were by my side ,
and i was very sad because i knew that
i was never , ever going to see him again .
what do you think that that means ?
how would i know ? i have all the same information you have .
excuse me , i need to make a phone call .
i don &apos;t know if gloria &apos;s dreams
can predict the future like mine can ,
but i do know that if something happened to jay ...
i couldn &apos;t live with myself .
of course , i wouldn &apos;t have to ,
because gloria would kill me .
ay , jay left his phone again .
cam .
why are you calling jay ?
am i ?
i @-@ i thought i was calling the gardener .
i forgot to leave the gate open ,
so i should probably go let him in .
it &apos;d be cruel to make caesar climb another big fence .
you know that maneuver
where you fly straight up until you stall
and then pull out of the dive ?
can we do that today ?
nope .
don &apos;t decide now . we &apos;ll talk when we &apos;re up .
hey , jay !
jay , hey , wait up .
do you think we can take off before he gets here ?
i think we can land before he gets here .
so this is a pre @-@ check , right ?
what are we looking for ?
nothing .
just trying to look cool for those girls over there .
jay , i need to talk to you before you fly .
it &apos;s a matter of life and ...
oh , good god .
cameron tucker .
gus .
hi , gus .
what do you want , cam ?
what do you want ?
what ? oh , yes .
you &apos;re not gonna want to get in that plane .
gloria had a terrible dream
where you fell from a great height and died .
all right , gus . up , up , and away .
no , jay , she seemed pretty upset ,
and if something were to happen --
she &apos;s always dreaming about me dying .
dede did the same thing .
it &apos;s typical wife stuff .
is it ?
nothing &apos;s gonna happen , cam .
tell him , gus . it &apos;s perfectly safe .
he &apos;s in good hands .
big hands , too -- i couldn &apos;t help but notice .
i &apos;m more worried about
dying from boredom in retirement than from a fiery crash .
now , thanks for your concern .
take your purse and go .
that &apos;s one of those tactical totes , isn &apos;t it ?
why , yes .
yes , it is , gus .
anyway , bye , cam .
no , you know what ? i &apos;m not going anywhere ,
because in gloria &apos;s dream , i was alive .
so if i &apos;m with you , this plane can &apos;t go down .
you think you being on this small plane
makes it less likely to crash ?
please don &apos;t do this to me in front of gus , okay ?
god , i was really into trolls .
yeah , especially your junior prom date with the baby teeth .
what do you want ?
i need to give clutterworth something
to get her off my back .
i never thought i &apos;d say this ,
but can i borrow some of your clothes ?
what about this ?
oh , no , no , no . put that down .
it &apos;s sanjay &apos;s .
and you &apos;re gonna keep it ?
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do with it yet .
here .
cut it into a million pieces .
he was my first real boyfriend .
so what ? he cheated on you .
you need to get over this guy and move on with your life .
i am so over him .
so why are you sniffing that ?
i &apos;m just smelling how stupid he smells .
oh , my god .
okay , fine . you &apos;re right .
i need closure .
i saw on instagram he &apos;s home for the weekend .
so ...
you take his stupid hoodie and his clunky shoes
and you go over there
and throw them in his dumb face .
those are my shoes .
mommy , it sounds like those raccoons are fighting again .
fine , i &apos;ll stop .
hey , what does he know about art ?
you &apos;ve seen his drawings .
he thinks jay is shorter than a flower .
i don &apos;t know what is happening .
i keep coaching her and coaching her ,
and she &apos;s just getting worse .
you know what ? i &apos;ll give her a few tips .
my flute of choice has always been the pan ,
but i suppose i could dumb it down .
this is a nightmare .
yes . she &apos;s terrible .
but the nightmare
is seeing your husband plunging to his death
and having people think that you did it
for the life insurance payout .
that &apos;s a new detail .
gloria , dreams don &apos;t predict the future .
they &apos;re windows into the subconscious .
maybe falling from a great height
is about my dad retiring .
you think ?
yeah , it could be .
he &apos;s no longer a big shot in the closet industry ,
which is apparently a thing .
maybe you &apos;re afraid that the two of you are growing apart .
it &apos;s happening already .
today we could have done all sorts of fun things together ,
and he decided to go golfing !
we could have gone to dance classes , the arboretum ,
the art gallery !
you &apos;re kind of swimming upstream with those .
look . if -- if you want him to do the things that you love ,
you may have to learn to do the things that he loves .
like what ?
golf ?
yeah . or marry cam .
he loves all that gay stuff you want to do .
claire , wait , wait , wait , wait !
honey .
we got another box of stuff to give away .
really ?
yep ! pop her open .
okay .
you were so right about the flowbee , by the way .
it is great , but i would miss all the gossip at the salon .
i &apos;m dying to hear
if natasha &apos;s estrogen patch is making a difference .
i saw her wednesday . it &apos;s not .
hey , you almost done back there ?
just making some room !
you know what ?
i am so happy to do this for you .
i love you way more than my beer making kit ...
oh , honey .
the wooden tennis racket .
i don &apos;t know , the cowboy hat .
the brown one .
what is taking so long ?
all set !
okay .
i &apos;ll see you guys later ,
and thank you so much for helping out today .
at your service , lady clutterworth . kiss on both cheeks .
bob &apos;s your uncle .
keep waving up high .
wave up high so she can &apos;t look down low .
son of a ...
seriously ?
honey , we don &apos;t want to give this stuff away .
we like it .
it &apos;s important to us .
how can it be important to you ?
you didn &apos;t even know it existed
until i told you to go through the closet and find it .
that is beside the point !
all of this stuff is packed with meaning !
really , phil ?
what does this cheap snow globe mean to you ?
we got that at a gas station in florida .
the snowman &apos;s melted .
it used to just be funny ,
but now it &apos;s also a poignant statement on global warming .
it &apos;s a poignant statement on hoarding ,
and we are donating it
along with the rest of this junk .
well , i can &apos;t believe you two .
you &apos;ll thank me when i &apos;m back at work
and i don &apos;t have time
to be picking up after you every two minutes .
guess what ?
she didn &apos;t get my lucky hat .
you should have kept the racket .
let &apos;s just dive in , all right ?
i &apos;m ready !
good .
all right , take a swing .
okay .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;re dealing with .
i get in front here ...
yes , you do .
and then ...
one , two , three !
it went so far away .
i am a natural .
no , he is . your ball is still on the tee .
i am worse than i thought then .
no , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s fine .
you just need to remember a few of the simple fundamentals
that helped me when i was learning , okay ?
don &apos;t worry about it . don &apos;t worry about it .
just line yourself up in front of the ball .
now what you want to do is keep
your right thumb on the left side of the shaft .
this one ?
yeah , mm @-@ hmm .
and then keep your head down . okay .
okay , and then the left arm straight ...
okay .
cup that left wrist .
there was one time when i put the leg and --
that was not helpful .
but then i feel like i want -- no ?
mm , i don &apos;t want you to do that .
okay .
not today .
and then what you &apos;re gonna do
is keep the right elbow in front of the body
as you swing up , and then rotate those hips .
one , two , three !
ay ! mama !
well , we &apos;re getting our money &apos;s worth out of that ball .
happy easter !
happy easter !
chickie ?
the minute i heard that voice ,
all the memories came flooding back --
hiding eggs in the backyard ,
the girls in their dresses ,
luke in his little blazer ,
phil in his ... bunny suit .
happy easter !
hang on ! hang on , chickie !
mama &apos;s coming .
happy easter !
hang on . i &apos;m coming .
baby , i didn &apos;t mean to throw you away .
happy easter !
hang on .
i can hear you .
i @-@ i -- oh , i don &apos;t hate this blouse .
happy easter !
this feels very weird .
well , it looks great .
now hinge your right arm into an l @-@ shape ,
keep your hands low ,
shift all the weight into the front foot ...
what do i do next ?
fire your golf coach !
no offense , red .
none taken , bald .
here .
just do what i do .
what , lose all your hair ?
i &apos;m sorry . i guess i was a little offended .
do you like dancing ?
yes , and i am much better
doing that than doing this .
well , this is just like dancing .
forget everything he said .
it &apos;s all about the rhythm . follow me .
swing back . follow through .
swing back .
follow through .
swing back .
i did it !
you &apos;re fired , red .
level her off .
good job .
you hear that ? flawless .
it makes sense this is second nature .
i &apos;ve logged a lot of remote @-@ control hours .
gus , what would you say is harder ,
r / c or the real thing ?
the real thing .
tough call .
what &apos;s rattling back there ?
uh , well , i don &apos;t --
i don &apos;t know what this thing is .
my controls .
roger that .
that tow bar come loose ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
is ...
is this -- is this the tow bar ? - yeah , that &apos;s it .
oh , ooh ! sorry , my bad . sorry , sorry .
no , no ,
that &apos;s all right . i got it . i got it .
peanut brittle , could this day get any better ?
get the tow bar off the yoke !
no , it &apos;s stuck between the seat !
i can &apos;t ! let it go ! i got it !
oh , gus ! gus !
i hate it when gloria &apos;s right .
gus . stay with us , gus . oh , my god . those cheekbones .
you look like j.f.k. jr .
he looks like j.f.k. jr . !
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
well , put it on autopilot .
put it on autopilot !
there is no autopilot .
this is a lawnmower with wings .
you fly remote control planes !
do what you do there !
i crash them !
that &apos;s why i buy them all the time !
i was wrong .
i don &apos;t want to die this way .
i &apos;ll settle for a nice , boring death at ground level .
well , technically , we will be dying at ground level !
i got it ! i got it ! i got it !
okay .
we &apos;re good .
great .
just so you know
i completely kept my cool through that whole thing .
listen , i know it felt great to hit a couple of lucky shots .
i hit a whole bucket of lucky shots .
but there &apos;s a limit to how good you can get
without learning the proper techniques .
i was trying to show you , but --
very good , lily .
what did you do ?
i just told her to forget everything and feel the music .
dad , manny &apos;s gonna teach me from now on .
ay , this is the second time you got fired today , red .
one , two , three .
look , everybody learns in different ways .
my intellectual approach just wasn &apos;t right for gloria ,
and it probably wasn &apos;t right for lily .
it -- it &apos;s humbling to admit ,
but i &apos;m just too smart to teach .
be strong . i &apos;m proud of you .
thanks .
you know , a lot of girls would have tried to look sexy
to show him what he &apos;s missing .
is there more to that ?
no , just trying to figure you out .
hello , sanjay .
or should we call you &quot; sans @-@ feelings &quot; ?
start over .
you left this at my house .
i was going to just cut it up in tiny little pieces ,
but i thought you should have to
look into the eyes of the person you hurt .
i hope your new little girlfriend is worth it .
she wasn &apos;t . it was a huge mistake .
i &apos;m not used to girls liking me .
stanford girls are all type &quot; a. &quot;
they &apos;re very aggressive .
i &apos;m in way over my head .
and that &apos;s supposed to make this okay ?
no . nothing &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m miserable .
and i miss you every day .
yeah , right .
seriously ?
oh , well , he seems sincere .
i am .
if i could go back in time ,
which the laws of physics don &apos;t disallow ,
i never would have hurt you .
well , if you believe in the multi @-@ verse ,
there currently exists a bubble of space @-@ time
where you didn &apos;t .
i wish we were there .
oh , my god .
is this geek foreplay ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t understand any of this .
if you were so unhappy , why didn &apos;t you contact me ?
i was ashamed and embarrassed .
i came to terms with being alone for the rest of my life .
i &apos;m home for the weekend ,
and my parents aren &apos;t even here .
you &apos;re parents aren &apos;t home ?
that , i understand .
i &apos;m home !
hi , daddy .
there they are .
there &apos;s my family .
come here , you little monkey !
ay , no . how much money did you lose ?
i didn &apos;t play golf today .
i took a flying lesson .
hmm ? and how was that ?
uneventful .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about it ?
i wanted it to be a surprise .
oh , well , then i have a surprise for you , too .
i took a golf lesson .
you &apos;re kidding . why ?
to play with you .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
darlene started playing with shorty .
she never stops talking .
he had to develop a slice just to get some alone time .
so what do you want to do ?
fly alone in your little plane ?
no . the whole point is to find something we can do together .
i pictured zipping up to napa for lunch ,
sedona for a sunset dinner .
you fall asleep after every meal .
i am not getting on a plane with you .
that &apos;s not true .
you eat a grilled cheese sandwich
and you can barely make it to the couch .
nothing like a grilled cheese nap .
i don &apos;t want you flying around in a little plane , either .
well , it &apos;s kind of my life &apos;s dream ,
but if you want me to stop , i &apos;ll do it for you .
i had a bad dream last night .
i think that this retirement thing is making me very scared .
join the club .
just not my country club .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
how do you know that ?
i don &apos;t . but we both spent the day trying to do something
we thought would make the other one happy
and that &apos;s a pretty good start .
i guess we just have to find something
that we have in common ,
like a project to do together !
hello ?
in a minute . mommy &apos;s thinking .
where the hell is clutterworth ?
on skid row giving our memories to hobos .
she threw out all my old vogues .
if i don &apos;t know the past , i &apos;m doomed to re @-@ wear it .
mom , this time --
oh , it &apos;s just you .
hey , party people .
why are you so happy ?
went over to sanjay &apos;s , got a little closure .
yeah ? well , some of your clothes are on inside out .
there you are . you threw out all my magazines .
yeah , and if i hadn &apos;t been here ,
you would have thrown out sanjay &apos;s hoodie
and then i would have never gotten the chance to return it ,
and then he never would have declared his undying love for me .
that &apos;s right . i &apos;m back .
and you took my lucky stick .
i love that stick .
i was holding it when i found my favorite rock .
oh , my god .
please tell me you didn &apos;t throw out rocky .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re all right . i &apos;m a terrible mother .
i &apos;m sorry .
what is happening ?
is it after 5 : 00 already ?
hey , you &apos;re back .
dad , something &apos;s wrong .
mom &apos;s apologizing .
no , we checked .
i couldn &apos;t save chickie .
and think about all the others i didn &apos;t save --
malibu barbie , pink bunny pillow ,
stretch armstrong .
wait . you threw away my stretch armstrong ?
yes . it &apos;s gone . they are all gone .
years of stress cleaning has eradicated
a lifetime of precious memories .
well , what if it hasn &apos;t ?
are you suggesting an alternate universe that parallels reality ?
i &apos;m suggesting a storage unit that parallels the freeway .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s all our old stuff .
ah ! my first bike !
my van gogh project !
my first phone !
yes , i &apos;ll hold for lizzie mcguire .
so all of those trips to the donation bin ...
i didn &apos;t always make it .
are you mad ?
it &apos;s amazing .
see ? i &apos;m controlling my woman .
oh , this is totally back in style .
oh , my god ! twister !
me , too .
i &apos;m ...
it &apos;s no ...
you just take that nutty energy of yours
and put it to good use at the office ,
and we &apos;ll be waiting for you when you get home .
you know we already claimed all this stuff on our taxes , right ?
there &apos;s my girl . yeah .
it wasn &apos;t easy , but i got it !
chickie !
oh , honey .
a little sticky , huh ?
happy easter !
oh ! is that really all it says ?
i feel like it used to say more .
happy easter !
mom , stop squeezing it .
i &apos;m n-- i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not squeezing it .
happy easter !
it &apos;s really annoying .
i &apos;m not doing anything .
happy easter !
so many good memories , though .
yep .
happy easter !
yeah , i @-@ i really cannot sleep with that going on all night .
happy easter !
happy easter !
rocky ? what &apos;s that for ?
you know what it &apos;s for .
happy easter !
happy easter !
