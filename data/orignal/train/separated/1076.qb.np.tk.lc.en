the burkes are going to washington .
good ! here it comes !
the mosconi codex ...
if this book is a puzzle ,
maybe these are the pieces .
take a look at the pages .
rain man it .
i got it .
this is the idol of sita .
the idol had eyes made out of rare diamonds .
the hope diamond-- we &apos;re looking for its twin .
this is rebecca &apos;s apartment . who is she , neal ?
her real name is rachel turner .
mi @-@ 5-- she was one of their agents .
the prime suspect in the murders
of curtis hagen and agent david siegel .
we have full video of her apartment .
neal , she &apos;s in love with you .
you are under arrest for murder .
do you accept a collect call from inmate ...
rachel turner . i &apos;ll see you soon .
you know d.c. was built on a swamp , right ?
total myth-- it was all wetlands .
that &apos;s a distinction without a difference .
pack a mosquito net .
i &apos;m from upstate .
our mosquitoes resemble small buzzards .
i &apos;ll be fine .
that experience with bloodsuckers
will come in handy when you start rubbing elbows
with congressmen .
well , thankfully , politics is only part of my new job .
gosh , you know , these last few months
have been ...
&quot; insane &quot; will do .
look , rebecca deceived us all .
are you holding up okay ?
rebecca &apos;s behind me .
right now i &apos;d rather focus on what my future looks like .
good , which is why i &apos;ve been giving
a lot of thought as to who your next handler will be .
that &apos;s not the future i have in mind .
the promotion at d.c.-- your case history
was a huge factor in that decision , right ?
that &apos;s right .
it was based in part on my successes
as a field agent .
our successes .
no more handlers ,
no more cases , no more anklet .
neal , what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying i want my sentence to be dropped .
i &apos;ve talked to a lawyer .
a recommendation from you is critical .
neal , you have time to serve .
being asac doesn &apos;t mean i give you special treatment .
it has nothing to do with rank .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re my supervising officer .
i &apos;m asking you to do what &apos;s right .
oh , i have spent a lot of my time with you
thinking about what &apos;s right .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that there &apos;s never a simple answer .
hey , i just got off the phone with the prosecutor &apos;s office .
you know the print on the bullet inside rebecca &apos;s gun ?
they &apos;re moving to indict ?
yeah , first thing tomorrow morning .
it &apos;s over , neal .
yeah , it &apos;s over .
listen , they want the evidence boxed up
and shipped immediately .
you want me to round up a couple of probies ?
you know , on my very first case ,
hughes had me bag and tag all the evidence myself .
it &apos;s only fitting that i do it on my last case .
come on , neal , let &apos;s box it all up .
all of it ?
all of it .
ready , neal ?
yes .
beers at work ?
yeah .
i know you &apos;re a stickler for rules ,
but if was ever there was a time to break one , it &apos;s now .
besides , we are officially off the clock .
that yours ?
no , i thought it was yours .
no .
it &apos;s one of rebecca &apos;s burner phones .
her voice @-@ mail access will be password protected .
the tech guys unlocked all her phones .
it should be as simple as ...
rebecca lowe , i got this number
from one of your associates .
i &apos;m in need of your ... services immediately .
call me back .
we need to see where this leads .
if rebecca &apos;s other clients are anything like hagen ...
someone could end up dead .
the caller got her name and number secondhand .
we could send someone undercover to meet him .
if he knows what she looks like , he &apos;ll bolt .
but if he doesn &apos;t ...
we have a case .
now , normally , i &apos;d send you in undercover
for something like this .
this isn &apos;t some like it hot .
you have someone good in mind ?
yeah , one of the best agents i know--
smart , relentless , tough .
able to leap tall buildings in a single bound ?
wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
hey , boss .
let &apos;s get to work .
so let me get this straight .
after we find out the client &apos;s identity ,
i have to impersonate rebecca , who &apos;s really rachel ,
hoping he doesn &apos;t know that she isn &apos;t a biracial woman
who has to pump every three hours ?
pump ?
i &apos;m a fantastic multitasker .
i &apos;ll do it on the fly .
then i determine what the job is , pretend to carry it out ,
and deliver evidence of completion to our mystery man ,
which , given rebecca &apos;s history , might include murder .
yeah .
look , diana , truth is , who knows if we even have a case ?
you know , i just wanted to bring you up to speed .
tons of unknowns ,
and i &apos;m not sure if we &apos;ll pursue it .
peter , i &apos;m in .
a bad guy wants to hire a bad girl
to do some really bad stuff .
i &apos;m the best person in the division
to keep that from happening .
you know that .
i do .
good .
now , i got to go change , and so does he .
you know your way around a dirty diaper , right ?
neal , the damn codex--
you have any idea what happens when you commit something like that to memory ?
it haunts you .
exactly !
try to sleep-- codex .
sit down to a delicious bowl of muesli--
codex .
all these signs and symbols floating around in my head ,
combining , separating , recombining , mocking me .
relax .
now that rebecca is gone ,
we can take a breath and go at this the right way .
think about it .
nobody is looking for the diamond except us .
you &apos;re right .
this could be it .
everything we &apos;ve always dreamed about--it &apos;s within reach .
with the money from the diamond ,
we could build a small consortium ,
a network of associates , properly financed cons .
maybe even a few small drones .
drones ? ah , i see you &apos;ve really thought this through .
it &apos;s perfect .
an illegitimate empire
paid for with the legitimate proceeds
from the diamond .
neal , it &apos;s our cotillion .
oh , that &apos;s peter . i got to run .
we &apos;re tracking someone who contacted rebecca
about doing a job .
diana &apos;s coming off maternity leave to go undercover .
what will she do with teddy ?
you mean theo ?
well , like most women from gloria steinem on ,
she &apos;ll probably hire a babysitter .
i &apos;ve never even met my namesake ,
yet some stranger is gonna mold his young , pliable mind ?
i delivered that child , neal .
how about we channel that righteous indignation
into finding the diamond ?
welcome back , agent berrigan .
thank you , agent jones .
now ...
what do we know about this guy ?
nothing .
we &apos;ve got a short voice mail and a phone .
yeah , no i.d. , no location .
whoever he is , if he doesn &apos;t hear back from rebecca lowe ,
he &apos;ll find someone else for the job .
we can &apos;t let that happen .
i agree .
if this is all we &apos;ve got , let &apos;s use it .
i was hoping you &apos;d call sooner .
i call when i call .
what &apos;s the assignment ?
all pertinent information
will be left at a drop site this afternoon .
negative .
i was given to understand this is how you did things .
then you understood wrong .
we meet in person in public .
those are my rules .
if you don &apos;t like them , too bad .
fine .
crawford plaza , tomorrow at noon .
my associate briefed me on your signal .
i &apos;ll be looking for it .
any bright ideas on what rebecca &apos;s signal could be ?
there &apos;s one way to find out .
she may not have much to say , neal , not to me .
well , i &apos;m sure you have ways of getting her to talk .
are you in contact with the van ?
up and running .
i &apos;ll try to make it fast .
agent burke ...
i never thought i &apos;d actually look forward
to a trip to the f.b.i.
didn &apos;t feel like coming down to the correction center ?
don &apos;t like seeing what happens to the stuff you flush down the drain ?
i like to control my environment ,
which makes two of us .
i could have killed you , you know .
i had you in my sights several times .
but i never would have done that to neal .
it would have torn him up .
why am i here ?
to strike a deal .
don &apos;t suppose you could help me with these .
your cell right now-- i hear it &apos;s pretty grim .
i can talk to the warden
about getting you some southern exposure .
not interested .
an extra hour or two in the yard every day ?
you know i only want one thing .
but what is it that you want ?
i want to know the signal you use when first making contact with a client .
hmm . just to quench your curiosity ?
something to put in the scrapbook ?
or did i get a job ?
it &apos;s good to feel wanted .
your signal-- what is it ?
i &apos;m not telling you .
but i will tell neal , after i &apos;ve had a chance
to talk to him about a few things .
no can do .
i &apos;m sure glad i didn &apos;t waste
a drive down to the mcc .
enjoy your view of civilization while you can .
okay .
okay , i will tell you .
but then i want to see him .
those are my terms .
how &apos;s that sound , neal ?
looks like we have a deal .
the signal is a watch , worn on the left hand , banded upside down .
what time ?
it should be set to 10 : 20 .
happy ?
that you &apos;ll soon be serving two consecutive life sentences ?
yeah , i &apos;m ecstatic .
i gave you what you wanted .
now it &apos;s my turn .
you &apos;re not going in until we know the signal works .
and if it does ...
just in case i need to be in contact with you .
you sure you &apos;re up for this ?
i wish i could say
absence made the heart grow fonder .
jones , how we looking ?
we &apos;ve got eyes and ears on diana .
diana , you with us ?
copy that .
ah , it looks like somebody &apos;s approaching-- here we go .
lovely day .
i like your watch .
you want something taken care of ?
you tell me what you want me to do .
i do it , you pay .
that &apos;s the deal .
i don &apos;t discuss the job till we &apos;re safely indoors .
given my line of work , you can &apos;t be too careful .
peter , we &apos;ve got a hitch .
diana &apos;s following our suspect .
no clue where they &apos;re headed .
did you i.d. him yet ?
yeah . conrad worth .
he was a suspect in an s.e.c. investigation a few months back .
never did pin anything on him ,
but he &apos;s looking really shady right about now .
peter , i don &apos;t like this .
someone backing her up ?
yep , i am .
diana called an audible . she &apos;s following the suspect .
make it quick in there .
neal ...
i hate for you to see me like this .
do you remember what my last words to you were ?
&quot; i &apos;ll see you soon . &quot;
here you are .
it &apos;s like something out of a novel .
yeah , the kind you buy in an airport
and then leave in your seat @-@ back pocket .
come on , i &apos;m still me .
i &apos;m still rebecca .
don &apos;t you see that ?
when i first met you ,
what i saw was the innocence of kate ,
the wit of sara , the allure of alex .
exactly . i &apos;m the perfect woman for you .
no , you made yourself into that ,
into something you &apos;re not
&apos;cause that &apos;s the job you were hired to do .
what you are is a murderer .
you can &apos;t separate the woman you fell in love with
from any of my identities .
it turned real .
you saw the true me .
and i know you .
i can tell you still have feelings for me .
rebecca , rachel ,
and whatever name you decide to call yourself
in the cafeteria line ...
it &apos;s over .
see , i can see what you &apos;re doing .
that slick facade--
it means you feel threatened .
neal , i can see right through all your lies .
i admire the minimalist touch .
we just moved in .
my partners and i-- we come and go as we please .
and besides , this day and age ... what more do you need ?
it &apos;s lovely .
now , can we can get down to specifics ?
it &apos;s funny .
with all i &apos;ve heard about you ,
i was expecting someone different .
please , sit down .
talk to me , jones .
i &apos;ve got eyes on diana .
they &apos;re on his terrace .
first sign of trouble , i &apos;m in .
you &apos;re not the only job on my horizon .
please tell me i &apos;m not wasting my time .
when i first heard about you , it was only in whispers .
your exploits are the stuff of legend .
there was one story .
you couldn &apos;t forget it if you &apos;ve you heard it .
some friends of mine , they saw it with their own eyes .
caracas , may 2009 ...
remind me--
how did that go down ?
enough with the closure , neal .
i need you to ask about ...
caracas , may 2009 ...
i want to know what happened .
neal , are you helping agent burke
make sure some bumbling agent is safely vetted ?
that &apos;s so beneath you . come on .
then i guess we &apos;re out of things to talk about .
all right .
you want to know some things ?
i got some questions too .
one for one , we answer each other truthfully .
okay .
but if you lie to me ,
i lie to you .
and besides , lovers are experts
at sniffing out one another &apos;s deceptions .
you know , what you &apos;re asking me to admit to
could get me thrown in jail .
are you wearing a wire ?
please .
then let me be blunt .
i don &apos;t discuss past jobs .
well , let me be blunt .
i &apos;m not sure you are who you say you are ,
so tell me what i need to know .
the story , neal--
we &apos;re running out of time .
how about i go first ?
something light to warm us up ?
do you think you &apos;re smarter
than your old friend peter burke ?
yes .
and peter thinks he &apos;s smarter than me .
well , you can &apos;t both be right .
which has resulted in years of debate .
now , one for one , truth for truth .
tell me what happened in caracas .
may 21 , 2009 .
an opera at the teatro teresa carreno ,
tight security--
i snuck in , removed a wire
from the orchestra &apos;s piano , and slipped it ...
over the lead actor &apos;s neck as the first act was ending .
he owed a very large debt to the city &apos;s mayor
and refused to pay ,
so i left his body onstage
and left his head on the mayor &apos;s doorstep .
that &apos;s the short version .
i left out the &apos; 54 gullwing
and the bridge jump over the guaire .
it &apos;s ...
nice to finally hear it from the source .
this is the address of an r &amp; d facility in midtown .
i need what &apos;s in vault 23 , compartment 3 .
the haul is tiny , but its importance to me is not .
and what is it ?
it &apos;s a thumb drive .
i need it friday morning , 9 : 00 a.m , period .
i expect my compensation upon delivery .
see , this r &amp; d facility--
it &apos;s not like slipping into an opera house .
it &apos;s incredibly secure .
i mean , maybe we should bring along some--i don &apos;t know--
muscle in case you get into trouble .
one thing i forgot to tell you about caracas .
someone got in my way as i was leaving the opera house .
so i snapped the tendon in his middle finger .
tendons are elastic , like rubber bands .
i later heard his doctor had to fish
for the severed end deep inside his elbow .
that enough muscle for you ?
you &apos;ll have the drive by friday morning .
not a bad story , huh ?
what &apos;s your professional opinion , one thief to another ?
you &apos;re not a thief .
admit it-- you still love me .
i wouldn &apos;t call what we had love .
i disagree .
neal ...
you and i belong together .
and how would that work exactly--
conjugal visits every third thursday ?
circumstances change .
come on , four years ago , would you have guessed
that you &apos;d be a snitch for the very people that were hunting you down ?
that &apos;s it , neal . we &apos;re done .
so you going after the diamond ?
who says i don &apos;t already have it ?
i do .
that little thing you just did with your eyebrow--it &apos;s a tell .
maybe i &apos;m working on it .
or maybe the diamond doesn &apos;t even exist .
oh , it exists ...
and you &apos;re getting close .
what are you gonna do
if you find it with that thing on your ankle ?
what then ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i do know that whatever happens next
sure as hell doesn &apos;t include you .
good @-@ bye , rebecca .
i think you invented a new sport in there .
psychological judo .
well , they say throwing salt on the wound
is the quickest way to heal .
i don &apos;t think they say that .
you sure ?
yeah , they say something about time .
well , time to move on .
i plan to ...
while she spends the rest of her life in a cell .
hey , about me saying that i &apos;m smarter than you in there ...
oh , i know you think you are .
that &apos;s why i always catch you .
good work .
the caracas story did the trick .
diana got the assignment ?
and then some .
caffrey .
looks like worth is targeting the offices of dcfi .
it &apos;s a hedge fund run by ian dybek .
ivy league , upper west sider ,
golfs at clubs that don &apos;t allow women .
dybek and worth managed the fund together
until they were investigated
伊恩 · 迪贝克
on suspicion of market manipulation .
yeah , a bunch of strange activity
from the company &apos;s server caught the attention of the s.e.c.
it turns out worth ran the high @-@ frequency trading division .
the s.e.c. shook him down .
but didn &apos;t get enough to press charges .
but dybek fired him anyway .
i think he needed a sacrificial lamb .
i let ian dybek know
that there &apos;s a security threat on his facility .
he want protection ?
no , he thanked me ,
then proceeded to bolt out of the building .
it looks like he tucked something small in his pocket .
looks like a thumb drive . where was he headed ?
home . i bet he had a reason .
like hiding the drive from the f.b.i.
firms like d.c.f.i pay a fortune for their trading algorithms .
yeah , a millisecond means the difference
between gaining and losing millions .
if there &apos;s an algorithm on that drive ,
it makes sense that worth would want to steal it .
but not why dybek hid it .
it &apos;s not illegal to use an algorithm .
unless it is .
the scene today as the market plummeted 1,000 points--
that &apos;s a 1,000 @-@ point dead drop ,
all because one fund moved a large amount of stock
when the market was vulnerable .
indeed , the broader market--
it started a chain reaction by high @-@ frequency trading servers ,
which caused the market to crash in seconds .
like high @-@ stakes jenga .
yep , but it &apos;s more like , um-- like throwing a banana peel .
you &apos;re saying that what tipped off the s.e.c.
might have been worth and dybek testing their algorithm
to see how many ones and zeroes they could make slip and fall .
there are billions to be made .
sell short before the market dives .
be first in line when it bounces back up .
the perfect crime , executed by computers .
and worth knows if he steals the algorithm ,
dybek can &apos;t report the theft without implicating himself .
if we &apos;re right ,
the only way to stop it is to get that drive .
we &apos;ll need a warrant .
that takes time .
worth wants the drive by friday .
what happens friday ?
so does the jobs report .
that means the market is primed to be volatile .
jones reach out to friendly judges for that warrant .
yep .
i &apos;ve got a briefing
with the cyber division first thing .
so , diana , be ready to move on dybek .
take neal .
i have one child .
another won &apos;t be a problem .
first day back , feels like old times .
play nice , you two . play nice .
do you remember when we first moved in ?
we ate off a crate for three months .
let &apos;s not buy a table for the georgetown house .
save some money .
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , we just have a lot of memories here .
we &apos;ll make some new ones .
i know .
does that have something to do with opening a can ?
mm , no , i think it has something to do
with pitting a mango .
never used it .
do you think neal would want it ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i do know that he doesn &apos;t want a handler anymore .
neal asked me to recommend that his sentence be terminated .
really ?
yeah .
neal ?
yeah .
off anklet ?
free to roam the world .
imagine the trouble he &apos;d find .
or not .
i don &apos;t know . maybe neal &apos;s changed .
we have been known to be a positive influence before .
yeah , but rebecca not only conned him .
she broke his heart .
what neal needs right now are rules ,
structure .
or what he needs is to figure out
what he wants in his life .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe this was a wake @-@ up call for neal .
peter never makes me work this early .
i &apos;ve been awake since 5 : 00 .
sleep means nothing to a hungry baby .
drink your coffee .
where are we going ?
i &apos;m undercover as rebecca lowe ,
and my assignment &apos;s to steal that flash drive .
you &apos;re gonna help me .
diana .
caffrey .
we &apos;re here .
congrats on surviving the most epic break @-@ up ever .
oh , thank you for not asking how i am .
two things we have in common--hating that question ...
and being fine going it alone .
listen , as your c.i.
you &apos;re not my c.i.
you &apos;re handling me .
ugh , that sounds all kinds of wrong .
well , so does this plan .
peter wants to go in with a warrant .
best case , he gets one . worst case , he doesn &apos;t .
in which case , we &apos;ll have the drive in hand .
motherhood &apos;s made you kind of badass .
i was always a badass .
there &apos;s dybek .
that must be his wife , iris .
they practically are each other .
karen ?
whoa , whoa , whoa . slow down .
is theo all right ? what ?
what &apos;s going on ?
okay , okay .
stay calm .
go home . i &apos;ll take it from here .
come on , i got this .
do it .
karen , i &apos;m home .
you !
he said there was a gas leak .
a ruse that karen accepted without question .
you &apos;re wearing a gas @-@ company uniform .
he showed me credentials .
which is more than i can say for you , karen--
if karen is your real name .
do you hear this ?
he keeps saying my name over and over again .
karen , karen , karen .
he refuses to leave .
and he insulted my baby food .
peas are patently uninspired .
are you aware that she is a ferberizer ?
ferberizer ?
that &apos;s it--i quit .
i can &apos;t take this .
no , karen . no , no .
please , i &apos;m begging you .
i &apos;m sorry , diana .
do you have any idea
how long it took me to find that nanny ?
oh , please .
she was one step away from louis wain cat drawings .
mozzie , how can you do this to me ?
the real question is ,
how could you let this baby sit in a wood @-@ paneled nursery ?
a black and white chevron pattern
would be much more stimulating to his burgeoning neurons .
okay , here &apos;s the part where i arrest you for home invasion .
that hurts .
you know , it &apos;s not too late
to build a small geodesic dome in here .
it will really aid in his spatial skills .
when would i build a dome ?
i &apos;m a working mother with no child care now
thanks to you .
he likes you .
of course he does .
i literally pulled him with these--
we do not need to relive that .
all right , he &apos;s yours ...
for the day .
if he gets fussy , that mobile my mother bought him
calms him down .
nap time ?
every three hours .
okay , teddy .
it &apos;s theo .
ian !
love bun ?
bunny , where are you ?
i &apos;m wearing your favorite outfit .
ian , my love bunny ...
i &apos;m coming .
bunny ?
oh , god .
i am not afraid to use this .
i did not mean to scare you .
wow . i think i know what happened .
i think we were double @-@ booked .
what ?
i &apos;m here for iris .
you know , we spend time together
while her husband &apos;s at work .
you mean iris has a ... ?
mister .
although it is a very coarse word
to describe what she and i have .
oh , i know , right ?
right .
fluffer @-@ nutter ?
all right , just hold him off until i can get out of here .
i &apos;ll call iris and suggest a hotel .
your secret &apos;s safe with me .
we both have so much in common ,
beyond looking great in silk .
thank you .
fluffer @-@ nutter ?
ian ? bunny ?
ian , hi .
i got a meeting in ten minutes .
oh , but i want a cha-- i want a change of pace .
i want a change of scenery .
on the couch , please ? please ?
oh , i just want you . i want you so bad--right now !
oh , eyes on me .
do not look away .
neal broke into dybek &apos;s residence ,
cracked his safe , and stole this ,
with no proof that the man is anything
but the target of a heist ,
and you sanctioned it .
correct .
i told you to wait until we have a warrant .
did you get one ?
not yet , but that doesn &apos;t mean--
by tomorrow morning ?
look , if the algorithm &apos;s on that drive ,
i couldn &apos;t risk dybek using it .
you put me in charge . i made a call .
you &apos;ve let neal cross lines for years .
diana , trust me .
do as i say .
actions make us who we are .
i stand by mine .
guys ...
i confirmed what &apos;s on the drive .
now we know what an algorithm looks like .
right . just a complicated series of commands to buy and sell ,
but when i applied it
to a simulation of the major stock market indexes ,
the market goes into a nosedive .
irreversible ,
with catastrophic consequences .
in eight hours , our economy would &apos;ve been in chaos .
and worth would &apos;ve been richer than scrooge mcduck .
wall street &apos;s a game .
he &apos;s got all the pieces in place--
the algorithm , the capital , and the jobs report .
and he won &apos;t stop till he pulls it off .
then i say we let him win .
if it &apos;s a game , we can all play .
he just won &apos;t know it .
exactly .
jones , contact the tech team .
we &apos;ve got until the market opens .
test .
yep , you &apos;re live .
you got me ?
yeah .
so that &apos;s identical to the one in dybek &apos;s safe ?
on the outside .
on the inside , it &apos;s a high @-@ bandwidth wi @-@ fi receiver .
once worth plugs it in , we &apos;ll control his computer .
he &apos;ll apply the algorithm , and if it works ...
he &apos;ll be fooled into thinking the market &apos;s tanking .
bingo .
and when he uses his firm &apos;s clients &apos; money
to make his trades ,
we got him on wire fraud , conspiracy , money laundering ...
intention to disrupt the u.s. economy .
and hiring an international thief / assassin
to do his bidding .
ah , bring it to me .
you get the drive when i get my money .
and you &apos;ll receive payment when i know
that those aren &apos;t ian &apos;s snapshots from augusta .
we &apos;re in ?
we &apos;re in .
there she is .
and ...
there she goes .
is that what &apos;s supposed to happen ?
it &apos;s a little difficult to explain to someone like you .
i could explain it to you .
keep it simple so i understand .
i just made a killing .
your turn .
explain that .
or i could tell you
what happened to the last guy who pointed a gun at me .
her cover &apos;s blown .
let &apos;s move .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m rebecca lowe .
who referred me ?
an associate from zurich .
i &apos;m not a fed .
yeah , that &apos;s not a bet that i care to hedge .
do you really think the government
would let millions of people lose billions of dollars
to sting one man ?
you &apos;re not that special .
now give me my money . we &apos;re done .
have you ever held a gun before ?
f.b.i.
you &apos;re under arrest .
hands behind your back .
now !
you okay ?
of course you are .
let &apos;s go .
who the hell sent that text ?
what do we have ?
tracing the sim card from worth &apos;s phone now .
peter , you won &apos;t believe where that text message came from .
where ?
the metropolitan corrections center .
rebecca .
warden maxwell , how the hell did she gain access
to a cell phone ?
one of my best agents was put in harm &apos;s way .
you and me--we &apos;re gonna get to the bottom of this .
peter , cell phones are currency in prison . it happens .
not with cop killers it doesn &apos;t .
if anything had--
well , it didn &apos;t .
we &apos;re not going there .
what do you say we both go home ?
see , they want you to think the apollo landed on the moon .
what they don &apos;t want you to know
is that the &quot; spaceship &quot; landed in our own backyard six times .
come on ...
what &apos;s more interesting than a good lunar con ?
kid ... you &apos;re kidding me !
of course .
every symbol could represent a number .
mosconi &apos;s symbols aren &apos;t a message .
they &apos;re numbers .
numbers we understand .
numbers we can work with .
don &apos;t let anyone tell you you &apos;ll never use math .
you &apos;re really good with babies .
oh , hairline .
and your timing is impeccable .
we have dybek in custody .
and just like any criminal , he lawyered up .
i wouldn &apos;t expect any less .
all these times , i not only allowed
but encouraged you to break the rules--
hell , the law .
it was never lost on me
that the actions i took were sanctioned by the fbi .
i was focused on closing cases .
and i let you scratch an itch .
i have a great dermatologist .
actions define us .
i made sure yours did .
got one question for you , just one .
shoot .
do you think you can go straight ?
yes .
peter , i &apos;ve never lied to you .
neal , you &apos;ve double @-@ talked , omitted , and bent the truth .
one word . no loopholes .
yes .
i want to believe it .
but after all you &apos;ve done , i &apos;m not sure i can .
if you can &apos;t ...
i &apos;ll have to do it on my own .
i &apos;ll get it .
fbi .
this is agent burke .
how ?
what ?
peter , what is it ?
rebecca escaped .
neal ?
neal ?
seriously ?
this is neal . leave a message .
neal , where are you ?
it &apos;s 4 a.m. i &apos;ve been calling all night .
i have glorious news .
thanks to baby teddy-- i &apos;ll explain later--
we know that mosconi &apos;s last clues were numbers--
numbers that , by the time you get home ,
will lead us to the diamond .
