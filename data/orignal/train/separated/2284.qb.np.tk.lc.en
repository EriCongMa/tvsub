because merida has failed to relinquish her crown ,
her brothers will be executed .
noooo !
kill her !
not today , mate .
get us out of here .
welcome home , your majesty .
ohh . does that hurt ?
i can make it go away .
i don &apos;t need any more of your dark magic .
really ? would you rather i sent you back
to face merlin and emma on your own ?
my dark magic is what allowed us to escape
after you let them take control of excalibur .
because you spent the battle pinned to a tree .
careful , or you &apos;ll wish you never cut me lose .
you think i want to be working with a villain like you ?
like it or not , we still need each other .
you mean you need me to help you finish
your pitiful quest to restore excalibur .
which i can use to destroy your sister so you can escape
and give birth to this precious child of yours .
well , what do you suggest ?
because the combined power of merlin and the dark one
makes your knights useless .
not true .
my knights will help us defeat our foes
if we give them the proper motivation .
how far can your magic transport us ?
far enough . why ?
where do you want to go ?
there &apos;s something that can help us in another land --
a land called dunbroch .
i did it , dad .
i saved the boys .
and i proved to the clans
that i am fit to be their queen .
well , i may have united the clans behind me ,
but now comes the hard part ...
ruling over them .
you always made it look so easy .
i wish you were here so you --
i could ask you how you did it .
he &apos;s always with you , merida ,
even if it doesn &apos;t seem like it .
i miss him , too .
but today is not a day to wallow in sadness .
come .
you can &apos;t be late for your own coronation .
几年前
show yourself , witch !
there &apos;s no witch here ,
just a simple woodcarver .
you gave me daughter magic ,
turned me wife and boys into bears .
you &apos;re a witch .
perhaps i ... dabble with magic .
good .
&apos;cause i need some .
invaders are attacking from the south .
if i &apos;m to lead the clans to victory over &apos; em ,
i &apos;m gonna need some magic .
something to stop invaders from the south ?
something to ensure the future of my kingdom .
yes .
i can help you .
but i must warn you , it won &apos;t come cheap .
whatever your price is , i &apos;ll pay it .
i &apos;m not in need of anything right now ,
but perhaps in the future .
call it an i.o.u.
very well .
then we have ourselves a deal .
let &apos;s see . this .
what &apos;s it do ?
wear this helm into battle ,
and you &apos;ll get exactly what you want .
aye .
on behalf of clans macintosh , dingwall , and macguffin ,
we freely give this crown .
then it is my honor
to crown you , merida of clan dunbroch ,
as our true and rightful --
did you forget to invite me , dear ?
what are you doing here , witch ?
is this about the magic i took ?
no , i &apos;m here because of another happy customer of mine --
king fergus .
lies . my father would never stoop so low .
well , he did not stoop --
except to get through the door .
but he did come for magic ...
... an enchanted helm , to be exact ,
one that glistens like the sun .
merida , i &apos;m afraid that is your father &apos;s mark .
unfortunately , king fergus died
before he could pay me what he owed .
um , with interest --
10,000 gold sceats .
that much gold would bankrupt the clans three times over .
if you don &apos;t have the gold ,
you could simply return the helm .
i can &apos;t return what i don &apos;t have .
then you best find it .
if you don &apos;t return it by sundown tomorrow ,
i &apos;ll have no choice but to curse the entire kingdom !
oh , you wouldn &apos;t .
one drop of this ,
and all your subjects will live out the rest of their lives --
as bears .
quiet ! keep your heads !
harder than it looks , dear .
if you ever hope to wear that crown ,
you need to figure out how to do
what you father couldn &apos;t--lead .
you won &apos;t find the helm here .
i will if you help me look .
check that sideboard .
no , you won &apos;t find it because it &apos;s not here .
i packed that helm in dad &apos;s trunk myself
when we left to fight the southern invaders .
you mean he was wearing it when --
when he was killed .
what was the witch on about
when she said dad didn &apos;t know how to lead ?
what do you think the helm &apos;s magic did ?
whatever it did ,
i &apos;m sure fergus had good reason for needing it .
but right now we have a more pressing question .
if the helm &apos;s lost ,
what are we going to do about the witch ?
i didn &apos;t say it was lost .
i just said it wasn &apos;t here .
you know where it is ?
after the knight killed dad ,
he took the helm from him right there on the battlefield .
whoever the killer is , he has the helm .
no , merida . absolutely not .
i haven &apos;t even said anything yet !
but i know what you &apos;re thinking .
you are not going after him .
that knight already took fergus from me .
i can &apos;t lose you , too .
if i don &apos;t figure out who he is and where to find him ,
my entire kingdom will be doomed .
he killed your father for that thing .
he won &apos;t give it up without a fight .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m counting on .
because this time , my arrow won &apos;t miss .
you &apos;re daft if you think
we &apos;d ever follow that wee lass into battle .
who said that ?
the next person to disrespect me daughter
loses his tongue .
dad , it &apos;s all right . i can look after myself .
i &apos;m afraid the front
is a lot rougher than you think , merida .
well , it can &apos;t be that rough
if they &apos;re writing their sweethearts back home .
those aren &apos;t love notes , lassie .
they &apos;re wills .
they think they &apos;re gonna die ?
you wanted to know what war was like .
i &apos;m afraid this is it .
what &apos;s that ?
ah ! it &apos;s me war bow .
i carried this into me first battle i ever fought .
i thought it only fitting
for you to carry it into your first battle .
you &apos;re giving it to me ?
aye .
thank you , dad .
what ?
are you trying to soften me up or something ?
you can &apos;t hide anything from me .
oh , your mother made me promise i &apos;d keep you safe .
so i hired a soldier to tutor you in the art of war .
oh , you think i need a man to babysit me ,
to teach me how to fight ?
i &apos;ll show you .
you may not need a man to teach you how to fight ,
but you can learn a thing or two from me .
i &apos;m mulan .
merida .
i &apos;ll teach you how to fight better than any man here .
i &apos;ll teach you the most important thing
you need to have to fight -- honor .
hand over the money ,
or things are going to get messy .
your boss promised us 10 barrels of whiskey , not 5 .
so ? the deal &apos;s changed .
now give me what you owe him ,
or i &apos;m gonna take it myself .
you really think you can push us around , little lady ?
touch me again , and you lose the hand .
is that so ?
i &apos;ll let you choose .
do you want me to take the left hand or the right ?
you &apos;re daft taking on these brutes by yourself .
i had it under control .
what are you doing here ?
looking for you .
it &apos;s my kingdom and my family , mulan .
i need your help .
sorry , but the only person i help these days is myself .
where &apos;s your sense of honor ?
honor .
honor won &apos;t fill my purse .
what &apos;s happened to you , mulan ?
the warrior who taught me never cared for gold or riches .
then you didn &apos;t know me very well .
if gold is what you &apos;re after , then have all i &apos;ve got .
okay , but on one condition .
aye . what &apos;s that ?
no more questions about me .
there it is .
whoa , whoa , easy .
easy . easy .
i see you &apos;ve met me pet .
i &apos;m afraid i won &apos;t be as easy to subdue .
we &apos;re here for the magic helm ,
i need it to save my kingdom .
you &apos;re not the only one , dear .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t have what you &apos;re looking for .
where is it ?
if i knew where it was ,
i wouldn &apos;t have sent someone to fetch it for me .
who did you send to find it ?
if you &apos;re not gonna buy anything ,
i think it &apos;s time you leave .
no one out @-@ witches me .
tell us who &apos;s looking for the helm ,
or you go bobbing for eye of newt .
all right , all right , i &apos;ll tell you .
merida of dunbroch , king fregus &apos; daughter .
she was a prisoner in my dungeon .
and you let her go ?
no wonder you only had half a sword .
i didn &apos;t let her go . she escaped .
is that supposed to make me feel better ?
you &apos;re lucky i &apos;m on your side
because , when i &apos;m done with that girl ,
she &apos;ll wish that she never left your prison cell .
this is it .
this is where my dad met his end .
what is it ?
this arrow , the fletching ,
i &apos;d recognize that anywhere .
i made it .
and ...
you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
this is the arrow i fired on that day ,
the one that just missed my father &apos;s killer .
but you didn &apos;t miss his cloak .
we can use this to find him .
i &apos;ve got to make him pay for what he did to my dad .
mourn on your own time .
we &apos;re wasting daylight . let &apos;s go .
what happened to you , mulan ?
what do you mean ?
you knew fergus , too , but you &apos;re acting like you --
like you never even met the man .
have you already forgotten our deal ?
no , i remember .
but what kind of friend would i be if it stuck to it ?
why have you closed off your heart like this ?
there &apos;s one lesson i didn &apos;t teach you
the last time we were here .
a true warrior doesn &apos;t let anything hurt them .
not bad .
next lesson , you never leave your flank open .
i didn &apos;t . i just wanted you to think i had .
you &apos;re learning .
fighting isn &apos;t about who &apos;s stronger .
it &apos;s about who &apos;s smarter .
look , fellas .
our queen @-@ to @-@ be knocked over her nursemaid .
too bad there not be any lassies
for you to fight on the battlefield .
why ? are you not gonna be there ?
merida , it &apos;s not worth it .
why not ?
i could kick his arse in front of everyone .
and that &apos;s being strong , not smart .
no one &apos;s gonna follow you out of fear .
well , what will make them follow me ?
these are your people , not mine .
if you don &apos;t know , you should ask someone who does ...
... someone who they &apos;re already following .
i love my dad .
and i won &apos;t give up until he has justice .
look , if we find a weaver ,
they can tell us where this fabric was made .
wait .
someone &apos;s coming .
that &apos;s a clever little trick ...
but not clever enough .
oh , come now .
you wouldn &apos;t attack a mother @-@ to @-@ be , now , would you ?
arthur , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m not going back to your dungeon
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking .
you really think i &apos;d come all the way to this wretched place
just to drag you back to camelot ?
we &apos;re here for something else , dear --
your father &apos;s helm .
you , the witch --
why does everybody want that bloody helmet ?
it &apos;s the only way i &apos;ll ever save my kingdom .
so has the witch threatened to turn your people into bears , too ?
you don &apos;t even know what the helm does , do you ?
it has the power to make other men fight your battles ,
however dangerous they may be .
are you lying ?
that can &apos;t be .
it is .
and it &apos;s the only way i &apos;ll ever get my knights
to stand up to merlin and the dark one .
no , my dad would never use magic
to force people to fight for him .
aww , apparently , daddy dearest
wasn &apos;t the great king that you thought he was .
back off .
we need that helm to stop the witch from cursing this land .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna have to find some other way to do that .
and who will even notice ?
these people are practically animals already .
even if we wanted to give it to you , we can &apos;t .
we don &apos;t have it .
perhaps you don &apos;t , but we will .
that belonged to my father !
i know .
and with a simple locator spell ,
it &apos;ll lead us to another one of his possessions --
the helm .
no .
but that bow was the last thing he ever gave me .
then you &apos;ll have to console yourself with memories
and the knowledge of what a terrible ruler
he turned out to be .
ta @-@ ta .
where are you going ?
where do you think ? home .
well , don &apos;t . there &apos;s no need .
they may have your bow , but we have this .
we &apos;ll find that helm first .
oh , you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
it &apos;s not about how we find the helm --
it &apos;s about what the helm &apos;s magic does .
why does that matter ?
well , &apos; cause now i understand what the witch meant
when she said my dad couldn &apos;t lead .
if he can &apos;t do it without magic , how can i ?
merida -- - no .
my father used dark magic to lead innocent men to their deaths ,
and he paid the price for it .
he died , too .
i &apos;m not gonna make the rest of the kingdom suffer
just to prove i could do what he couldn &apos;t .
so you &apos;re gonna let the witch curse dunbroch ?
no , i &apos;m gonna do what i should &apos;ve from the start --
tell macintosh and the rest of the lords
i can &apos;t find the helm ,
give them enough time to get it
before the witch turns us all into bears .
those lords can &apos;t even find the pointy end of their spear .
well , they still stand a better chance than i ever will .
you cannot give up like this !
why not ? you have .
or is there another reason you &apos;re out here
working for the highest bidder ?
what are you doing down here ?
i wanted to stand watch for myself .
the invaders will be sailing in any day now .
do you think we &apos;ll win the war ?
ah , we &apos;ll give &apos; em everything we got .
what is it , daughter ?
i can tell something &apos;s on your mind .
mulan &apos;s a right good teacher .
there &apos;s one thing she can &apos;t teach me about leading this army .
what might that be ?
how to inspire the clans to follow me into battle ?
how do you do it ?
how have you inspired all these men
to follow you into battle ,
especially when so many of them know they &apos;re gonna die ?
dad ...
... is everything all right ?
aye .
there &apos;s only one way
to get men to follow you into a deadly battle .
that &apos;s by showing them
you &apos;re the first one willing to die .
&apos;cause if their king is willing to lay down his life ,
they know just how important winning the battle is .
is that really what you &apos;re gonna do ?
aw , you don &apos;t have to worry about me , lass .
i &apos;m the bear king .
i faced mor &apos;du .
i can handle whatever the southern invaders throw at us .
now , unless you want them to slip by ,
best keep me eye on the sea .
all right , witch .
show me who this cloak belongs to .
you &apos;re not a wolf .
you just need a little help remembering who you are .
sorry about that .
my name &apos;s ruby .
my friends call me red .
how did you know i was a girl in wolf &apos;s clothing ?
you &apos;re not the first person i &apos;ve met
who a witch turned into a animal .
mm . yeah , well ,
wolfing out is kind of my thing .
but the witch found a way to put me under her thrall .
are you mulan ?
yes . have we met ?
no , but my friends told me about you .
phillip and aurora ?
mary margaret and emma .
but , uh , i know phillip and aurora .
i was in the other land with them .
last i saw , they &apos;re doing great .
they were about to have a child .
is everything okay ? did i say something ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s just i know how difficult it is
traveling between realms .
how did you end up back here ?
excuse me ,
if i could have everyone &apos;s attention just for a moment ...
it is our great joy to introduce you to our son ...
prince neal .
what is it ?
what &apos;s what ?
well , we just defeated the wicked witch
and survived a time @-@ travel adventure
we didn &apos;t know we were a part of ,
and you &apos;re ... what ? the new bathroom attendant ?
what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m fine .
okay .
look ...
ever since we got back to storybrooke ,
i feel like i haven &apos;t ...
fit in .
and at first i thought it was because of the curse ,
but now that it &apos;s been broken , i --
because you &apos;re the only one of your kind here .
maybe .
i don &apos;t know . i --
yeah , probably .
i just -- i want to find more people like me .
so i &apos;ve been helping tiny work on his burnt @-@ out fields ,
back when we thought we were gonna have to escape zelena , and ...
we haven &apos;t had much luck ,
but we did manage to grow this .
you want to go back to the enchanted forest .
please don &apos;t try to stop me . i know you think i &apos;m crazy .
i think you need to do what makes you happy .
really ?
you are my friend .
what else could i possibly want for you ?
it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m not gonna miss you .
not as much as i &apos;ll miss you .
and did you find what you were looking for here ?
no .
my pack , the ... others like me were gone .
there &apos;s no trace of them .
so i went to the witch for help .
and that &apos;s when she turned you into her guard dog .
thank you for freeing me .
at least my visit helped someone .
why exactly were you there ?
i set a bad example for an old friend .
i wanted to find a way to make things right .
i thought the witch might have some magic
that would help us track down
the man who killed my friend &apos;s father .
that belonged to him ?
yes .
you don &apos;t need magic to hunt the killer down .
come on . let &apos;s go help your friend .
you can &apos;t seriously be considering
giving the crown to him ?
it &apos;s the only way to ensure
we won &apos;t all end up under the witch &apos;s curse .
i think i &apos;d rather be a bear again
than bow down to clan macintosh .
mom .
if you can find the helm before the witch &apos;s deadline ...
... the crown is yours .
don &apos;t hand it over just yet .
you were right , merida .
i gave up , and i was wrong .
but so were you .
we &apos;re gonna find the knight that ran fergus through .
how ?
i brought a friend .
i &apos;m gonna sniff him out .
have you already forgotten everything i taught you ?
why do we have to start before the rooster &apos;s even crowed .
the invaders .
you brought me out here to keep me from the fight .
dad put you up to it , didn &apos;t he ?
merida ...
out of my way .
no .
draw !
only cowards attack
without declaring where they &apos;re from
or who they fight for .
we &apos;re not ashamed of who we are .
no !
so let &apos;s show them what happens
when you face the combined might
of clans dunbroch , macintosh ,
dingwall , and macguffin !
i am not gonna miss this fight .
dad !
fergus !
no !
no !
no !
let &apos;s go .
are you certain the helm &apos;s here ?
well , this is where daddy dunbroch &apos;s bow
says it is .
when will you learn to stop doubting me , dear ?
that doesn &apos;t belong to you .
oh , you don &apos;t know when to give up .
where is he ? where &apos;s the man who killed my dad ?
that &apos;s him . he killed fergus .
his scent is all over this cloak .
you ...
you &apos;re the one .
i led my knights on a quest
to find the missing piece of excalibur .
we heard rumor of magic in these lands ,
so i landed here in the hopes
i could finally complete my sword .
so it &apos;s true .
you killed my father .
a knight does what he must on the battlefield .
you &apos;re gonna get yourself killed .
she isn &apos;t the only one .
this isn &apos;t about revenge .
this is about you finding the helm
and saving your people .
but he -- if you &apos;re the one who killed my dad ,
why don &apos;t you have the helm ?
i saw you take it off him with my own eyes .
&apos;cause the helm fergus was wearing when he died
wasn &apos;t enchanted .
what ?
it was a piece of iron polished to a shine .
when i put it on to rally my men , it didn &apos;t do anything .
we lost the battle .
dad must &apos;ve thrown the helm he got from the witch
into the sea before the battle began .
and you know what this means , right ?
he didn &apos;t use magic to lead the troops into battle .
they followed him because they believed in him .
oh , as touching as this family drama is ,
we need the helm .
and i &apos;m gonna do whatever it takes
to stop you from leaving dunbroch with it .
my people are counting on me .
and so are mine .
i &apos;ve already kelled dunbroch &apos;s king .
now it looks like i &apos;ll have to kill its queen .
you have no idea of the dark path you sent me down .
oh , i &apos;ve been down plenty of my own .
it &apos;s the burden of wearing a crown .
i blamed myself for my dad &apos;s death ,
when i really should &apos;ve blamed you .
i &apos;m not just gonna keep you from getting the helm .
i &apos;m gonna make you pay for what you did to him .
don &apos;t take another step .
this isn &apos;t your battle .
do you have any idea who you &apos;re dealing with ?
you don &apos;t scare me .
sleeping powder . clever .
she used it on me .
how do you like it now , witch ?
hurry . it won &apos;t last long .
i need that helm to get excalibur
and fulfill my destiny as camelot &apos;s king .
reach for it ,
and i will cut you down just like your father .
make another move ,
and you &apos;ll look like a porcupine .
this time , one of those arrows
is bound to hit more than just your cloak .
oh , where &apos;s that bloody witch when i need her ?
she &apos;s sleeping on the job .
even your magic can &apos;t stop all these arrows .
seems we need to find some other means of retrieving excalibur .
yes .
but perhaps that &apos;s a discussion best had in camelot .
who &apos;s she ?
thank you .
all of you .
i wouldn &apos;t have the helm if it wasn &apos;t for you .
we couldn &apos;t let our queen fall .
after all this ...
... you still want me to be your queen ?
you were willing to give up your crown
for the good of the kingdom ,
give up your life to get that helm .
i only ever saw one person make a sacrifice like that ,
and it was your father .
if you &apos;re not fit to lead the clans ,
no one is .
presenting queen merida of dunbroch ,
leader of the clans , protector of the highlands
and my daughter .
you &apos;re early .
the sun &apos;s nearly set .
unless you want to rule over a kingdom of bears ,
you better have me helm .
oh , i have it ,
but i &apos;m not gonna hand it over to you .
i &apos;m going to destroy it .
are you sure that &apos;s wise , dear ?
merida ?
i know what i &apos;m doing , mother .
no one should have the power
to lead people into a fight they don &apos;t believe in .
i &apos;ll find a way to stop your curse ,
but i am not going to be bullied into giving this back .
i was hoping you &apos;d say that .
what , now ?
this was never about the helm , dear .
this was about you .
you mean this was all a test ?
king fergus came to me asking for magic
to ensure the future of his kingdom ,
and that &apos;s exactly what i gave him .
getting the helm back made me understand
what it takes to rule .
your magic &apos;s never very direct , is it ?
it gets the job done .
i pride myself on satisfied customers .
are we done , then ?
not quite .
i wouldn &apos;t have come to a coronation without a gift .
it &apos;s not another carving of a bear , is it ?
better .
there &apos;s one person
who could not be here today to see you crowned .
my dad .
what &apos;s that ?
magical ale .
you know the legend of seonaidh , don &apos;t you , dear ?
aye . is it true ?
indeed .
one cup of this can summon the spirit of anyone
who &apos;s passed to the underworld .
you mean i can talk to my dad ?
thank you .
long live , queen merida !
thank you .
if it weren &apos;t for the two of you ,
i &apos;d have let my whole kingdom down .
and if it weren &apos;t for you ,
i &apos;d still be shaking down thugs in a tavern .
and i &apos;d still be licking my chops
in that witch &apos;s cottage .
here .
it wouldn &apos;t be honorable for me to keep this .
does this mean i can finally ask
what happened before i found you ?
well , if you must know ...
i was trying to get over a broken heart .
i waited too long
to tell someone how i felt about them .
and when i finally worked up the courage ,
it was too late .
i &apos;m sorry , mulan .
you know , i might not be the best person
to ask for dating advice .
i kind of ate the only boyfriend i &apos;ve ever had .
yes , i think that disqualifies you .
but ... maybe i can help .
come with me .
it might do you some good .
searching for werewolves ?
it &apos;s better than wallowing in self @-@ pity .
i don &apos;t wallow .
look , maybe helping someone else find their path
will help you with yours .
thank you .
well , good luck .
to both of you .
here it goes .
don &apos;t waste that .
it &apos;s good ale .
dad .
merida ...
you did it .
you became queen .
i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
i lost faith in you .
i thought you used the enchanted helm
to lead your troops into battle .
it &apos;s all right .
i lost faith in meself
when i went to the witch for that helm .
why didn &apos;t you use it ?
what made you change your mind ?
you did ...
the night before the battle .
after i spoke to you ,
i realized if i wanted to show you
what it took to be a leader ,
i couldn &apos;t use magic to do it .
you showed me what a true leader is .
and i will never forget that .
i just want to make you proud , dad .
you already have .
i wish you were still here .
me too .
dad ...
i love you .
arthur ...
you have no idea what &apos;s coming for you .
