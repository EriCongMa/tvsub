the boys of sudworth place
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
make no mistake about it .
sean wallace is a gang @-@ affiliated criminal
who only cares about himself and his fellow street thugs .
sure , it &apos;s breaking and entering now ,
but what &apos;s it going to be next ?
first @-@ degree murder ?
your honor , i believe that the pursuit of justice
is never a waste of time .
but in this case , there &apos;s no question ,
that man is guilty .
the prosecution rests .
do me a favor .
close your eyes for a moment .
go ahead .
now , i want you to erase the image in your head
that you have of my client .
now , imagine an 8 @-@ year @-@ old sean wallace .
he &apos;s scared and alone .
starving for love and attention .
now , i know you &apos;re thinking , where &apos;s his family ?
well , let &apos;s start with his mother .
a local prostitute who spends most of her time
either in bed with strangers
or shooting up drugs .
then there &apos;s his abusive father ,
currently serving 25 to life .
and finally , the aunts and uncles
who only saw sean as a monthly paycheck .
so , with no other place to go ...
sean turned to his peers on the streets .
you can open your eyes now .
it &apos;s true ,
sean fell victim to the gang community ,
but it was not because he wanted to .
it was because they were the only family that he &apos;d ever known .
ladies and gentlemen , instead of pushing this young man further away ,
let &apos;s do what every loving parent would do .
let &apos;s help .
i urge you to impose probation and community service
in lieu of jail time .
let &apos;s--let &apos;s stretch out our hands , as it were ,
and help this young man to his feet .
defense rests .
the jurors can retire to the jury room and begin deliberating .
court is adjourned .
so what do you think my chances are ?
well , how many of the jurors smiled at you ?
like ... 4 , maybe .
then i &apos;d say they &apos;re pretty good .
yeah , i thought i could get out early ,
but i just got caught up in some paperwork .
so , anyway , i &apos;m heading to the car now .
be home soon . love you .
what the hell are you-- that &apos;s my car !
what the hell are you doing ? !
i &apos;m calling the cops .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
yeah , there &apos;s a guy smashing up my car .
what &apos;s your name , sir ?
sir , what &apos;s your name ?
uh , jack westbrook .
and where are you right now ?
i &apos;m outside marty &apos;s near vernon .
wait a minute , he &apos;s running away .
sir , stay where you are .
mr. westbrook , do not pursue .
do not follow him .
sir .
sir , are you still there ?
hello ?
mr. westbrook ?
yeah , i &apos;m--i &apos;m here .
officers have been dispatched .
sir ?
help is on the way .
oh , there you are .
i &apos;m sorry . the traffic was horrible .
chris had a double shift .
megan needed to be dropped at a friend &apos;s .
hotch said we &apos;re dealing with an abduction ?
sadly , yes . 12 : 34 this morning .
boston defense attorney jack westbrook was abducted
from a convenience store parking lot .
that &apos;s precise . who called it in ?
he did . he was on the phone with the 911 operator
when he was taken .
cute shoes .
hey , thank you .
sir , sir , are you still there ?
hello ? mr. westbrook ?
yeah , i &apos;m--i &apos;m here .
officers have been dispatched .
sir ?
did you just hear that ?
garcia , can you enhance the audio at the end ?
i think i can . give me a second .
you got him ?
someone else besides the unsub was there .
he had a partner .
have there been any ransom demands ?
no , nothing yet .
this guy &apos;s made a lot of enemies .
he was the lead prosecutor responsible for putting away
key members of the buccieri family .
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time a convict targeted an attorney .
just last year in texas eric lyle williams
killed two prosecutors .
yeah , according to this , they weren &apos;t all high profile .
he prosecuted or defended everyone
from drunk drivers to gang members .
so basically , half the criminal population of boston
could be holding this guy for ransom .
and the other half could be victims or family members
of the criminals he defended .
i hate to be the odd woman out here ,
but isn &apos;t it possible he was just a victim of opportunity ?
i mean , he was in a sketchy area after dark .
true .
but you heard the recording . the attack on the car
was most likely a ruse to isolate him .
it says target to me .
it &apos;s been over 12 hours since he disappeared .
if the motivation was revenge , he could already be dead .
well , unless we have reason to believe otherwise ,
jack westbrook is alive .
we need to find him . wheels up in 30 .
is anybody there ?
i need some help .
i &apos;m down here .
please , let me out of here .
you ready to come clean ?
come clean ? what are you--
you &apos;ve got the wrong person .
why are we even listening to this crap ?
we should just kill him .
no , no , no , no . please .
not until we get his confession .
i swear , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
please ! just let me go .
can &apos;t do that , mr. westbrook .
not after we went through the trouble of getting you here .
besides , we &apos;re just getting started .
wayne dyer once said ,
&quot; how people treat you is their karma .
how you react is yours . &quot;
all right , let &apos;s go over victimology .
jack westbrook &apos;s life reads
like a practice guide to being perfect .
graduated first in his class .
went on to be the a.d.a. in several rural counties .
his marvelous track record caught
the attention of the higher @-@ ups .
within 6 years he was in the boston big leagues .
4 years ago he made a 180,
went from prosecuting criminals to defending them . i wonder why .
he may have been tired of dealing with all the politics .
or he wanted better pay .
with his kind of trial experience are in high demand .
looks like jack isn &apos;t all dollar signs .
it says here he worked with a number of nonprofits
and even took on several pro bono cases every year .
he seems to have checked all the boxes in his personal life , too .
he and his wife linda have been married for almost 7 years .
they &apos;re expecting their first child in january .
did you think i was joking when i said his life was so pristine ?
mm . even someone this perfect
is bound to have some skeletons in the closet .
it says that he and his wife
did a lot of moving around in the area .
they never stayed in the same place more than a couple of years .
well , that makes sense . guy seems pretty ambitious .
all the relocating could have been for better job opportunities .
yeah , or they feared retaliation from the people he put away .
last year alone , he won 33 of the 35 cases
he defended , giving him a 94 % success rate .
we should concentrate on the 6 % .
he could have made promises and not delivered .
agent hotcher . thanks for coming out .
detective . this is agent jareau .
welcome . right this way .
we &apos;ve got units posted at both the victim &apos;s workplace and residence .
brought in some extra manpower to work the phones
in case these guys try and reach out , like you suggested .
good . thank you .
you and your team can set up over there .
is that mrs. westbrook ?
hasn &apos;t said a word since she came in .
you know , this type of stress can &apos;t be too good for the baby .
hopefully she has better luck than i did .
linda ?
i &apos;m jennifer . i &apos;m with the fbi .
i want to ask you some questions about your husband .
is that all right ?
great .
um , you know what ?
why don &apos;t we go somewhere a little more private .
have a seat , please .
can i get you something to drink ?
no , thank you .
may i ask how far along you are ?
7 months .
a boy .
i have a son . he &apos;s 6 .
can you tell me about the last time you spoke to jack ?
at lunch yesterday .
i missed his call last night .
he said he &apos;d gotten caught up with paperwork .
had he always worked long hours ?
for the most part .
i read that the two of you moved around the area a lot . why ?
his job used to make him paranoid .
i can &apos;t tell you how many times he changed his phone number .
but once he got the new job ...
things were different .
how so ?
well , for the first time he wasn &apos;t looking over his shoulder .
he was defending the underdog .
we--we finally settled down ...
and bought a house .
and that &apos;s when we decided to start a family . i &apos;m sorry .
hey , it &apos;s ok . i know , this is very hard . ok ?
your husband &apos;s last purchase was from a convenience store .
he bought flowers .
were the two of you celebrating something ?
he won .
whenever jack won a case ,
he brought me flowers .
it was his way of thanking me for dealing with the long hours .
please ,
please find my husband . please .
look , whatever i did to you in court ,
i &apos;m sorry .
i know the system isn &apos;t fair .
i was just doing my job .
please , just ...
tell me what you want .
whatever trouble you &apos;re in ,
you know , i can help .
let &apos;s just talk this through . i can fix this .
you really have no idea , do you ?
no !
no !
i--uhh--i don &apos;t !
just tell me-- tell me what it is you want . is it money ?
is that what this is about ? name your price .
you can &apos;t buy your way out of this .
you know , my wife knows i &apos;m missing .
so do the cops .
you let me go , i won &apos;t say a word .
we ain &apos;t worried about the cops .
let &apos;s get this show on the road .
take off your clothes .
what ?
why ?
&apos;cause i said so !
get the camera ready .
what are you waiting for ?
i said take &apos; em off .
i &apos;m not taking off my clothes .
you know ...
maybe i didn &apos;t make myself clear .
what are you doing , man ?
showing this punk what &apos;s gonna happen
if he doesn &apos;t follow directions .
just--just do what he says , all right ?
the amount of detail needed to pull off this abduction
was pretty sophisticated .
yeah . not only did they lure him to the lot ,
but they managed to dodge most of the security cameras .
well , at least we know one of the unsubs is a football fan .
him and the 636,479 other people in this city .
what ?
not you , too ?
i googled it .
wow , they definitely did a number on his car .
and saved the real torture for him .
that &apos;s a lot of rage .
if it were a body ,
we &apos;d say this was complete overkill .
you think these guys knew jack personally ?
it &apos;s sure starting to look that way .
how long has jack westbrook worked for your company ?
almost two years .
had he received any threats recently ?
not to my knowledge .
in fact , his clients love him .
can you tell us about his current caseload .
well , they &apos;re pretty straightforward .
duis , grand larceny .
nothing that would have had this type of blowback .
what about the cases he lost ?
they were both minor .
family disputes .
one client was sentenced to probation ,
the other to anger management classes .
his wife mentioned that he &apos;d been working a lot of overtime lately .
what was he working on ?
well , he just wrapped a case yesterday ,
got the kid off with community service .
jack didn &apos;t work overtime for that .
if fact , he hadn &apos;t billed any overtime in months .
most days , he was off the clock by 6 : 00 .
if westbrook wasn &apos;t at home or
in his office , where the hell was he ?
that &apos;s a good question . i &apos;m starting to think his abduction
had nothing to do with a case .
what are you willing to bet that those roses
had more to do with guilt than romance ?
i am made of cream . give me your coffee .
hey , baby girl , listen , you &apos;re on speaker .
reid and i think westbrook might have been having an affair .
and the plot thickens .
yeah . i need you to dig deeper into his personal life .
he &apos;s definitely hiding something .
look at hotel invoices , large cash withdrawals ,
anything that screams mistress .
oh , if he is sharing his sugar , i will let you know .
thanks , mama .
so you think this could be a jealous boyfriend
or husband and his buddy out for revenge ?
right now we can &apos;t rule out anything .
it &apos;s probably not the first time
this guy flew into a jealous rage .
i &apos;ll put together a list of recent domestic disputes .
you &apos;re on speaker , garcia .
i have searched hither and down for something
that will connect mr. can &apos;t @-@ keep @-@ it @-@ in @-@ his @-@ pants
with this mystery woman .
i came up with zilch
until i went back two years ago ,
and i found an llc in jack &apos;s name .
here &apos;s where things get super suspect .
that company has been wiring money
to cover the rent of an apartment downtown ,
and the name on the lease is ...
westbrook .
winner , winner , vegetarian dinner .
sounds like the perfect place to keep a mistress .
any leads on the mystery woman ?
no . there &apos;s no texts , there &apos;s no emails , phone calls , nothing .
whoever she is , he &apos;s keeping her really well hid .
clear .
clear here .
wow . check this place out .
talk about a man cave .
he spared no expense .
how much did all this cost ?
at least 10 grand .
jack has an odd sense of romance .
i expected more from the guy .
this place wasn &apos;t just for romance .
it was his escape .
no ! stop !
how does if feel to be on the other side ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about !
what &apos;s wrong ? you don &apos;t like the attention .
why are you doing this ?
come on .
smile for the camera .
now you know how matt felt .
what did you say ?
stand up .
stand up !
remember us ?
you think he &apos;s in shock ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
he &apos;d better start talking soon .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve had enough ?
what if he doesn &apos;t start talking ?
he will .
trust me .
yeah , but what if he doesn &apos;t ?
then what &apos;s the plan ?
we bring in reinforcements .
well , apparently none of the neighbors have seen jack enter
or leave the apartment in the last 6 months .
i don &apos;t get it . why get married if you &apos;re just gonna cheat ?
well , some people think the grass is greener on the other side .
yeah ? what about you ?
oh , my grass is plenty green .
morgan .
we need to deliver the profile .
did you-- did you find him ?
have a seat .
oh , god .
is he ok ?
in order to help find your husband ,
i need to share some difficult truths .
will you please tell me what &apos;s going on .
we have reason to believe your husband &apos;s a pedophile .
what are you talk-- what are you talking about ?
we found evidence that would allow us to charge jack ...
this has to be some sort of mistake .
with multiple counts of both production ...
you &apos;re wrong ! no !
and possession of pornography .
no !
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
oh , my god .
which is why we believe jack westbrook
used his position of authority
to exploit the trust of his young victims .
as an attorney , westbrook had unfettered access
to vulnerable victims who were easy to groom .
he targeted those who would be afraid to come forward ,
because they &apos;d been ostracized from society due to their crimes .
much like jerry sandusky , who hid behind
his nonprofit foundation for underprivileged and at @-@ risk youth
in order to abuse young boys over several decades .
we found hundreds of photographs
of westbrook &apos;s victims in his apartment .
based on the dates on the photos ,
our unsubs are now in their 20s .
we think his past came back to haunt him .
the unsubs are either former victims
or family members seeking revenge .
and when they were younger ,
each of the victims had run @-@ ins with the law ,
which is how they came in contact with westbrook .
they &apos;ve been carrying the burden of the victimization
around with them for years , and it &apos;s affected their ability
to find and maintain employment as well as serious relationships .
this mutual trauma would cause them
to isolate themselves from others ,
yet draw them close to one another .
their shared revenge motive makes them
extremely dangerous and volatile .
this is a deeply personal mission ,
and it &apos;s been fueled by years of shame , hatred , and anger
which has finally exploded to the surface .
keep in mind the unsubs are also victims .
make it known that we have every intention
of bringing westbrook to justice for his crimes .
why go after westbrook now , after all these years ?
it &apos;s likely something pushed one ,
if not both of the unsubs over the edge .
it could have been an anniversary or a recent death .
and understanding that trigger
will be key to preventing these two
from crossing the line between kidnapping and killing .
thank you .
dude , you should have seen your face .
it wasn &apos;t funny , chad .
you gays could just call .
why ? so you can send our calls
to voicemail again ?
and where were you yesterday , huh ?
i had to work .
yeah , bull .
will one of you tell me why the hell i &apos;m here .
go see for yourself .
you ok ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m fine . let &apos;s just get this guy .
how did linda take it ?
well , at first she defended him ,
insisted he would have never jeopardized his career .
but by the end , she was asking me
if i knew any good divorce lawyers .
what about out here ? anything ?
dating back to early 2000 .
this guy literally has hundreds of cases
involving young boys .
the list of victims and potential unsubs
just keep getting longer .
moving around wasn &apos;t for safety .
it was because he wanted to avoid getting caught .
westbrook didn &apos;t touch these kids .
what are you talking about ?
linda was right .
he wouldn &apos;t have jeopardized his career .
he &apos;s smart .
these boys are too big of a risk .
think about it .
sandusky didn &apos;t molest his players .
he kept it separate .
we need to be looking for
a place that &apos;s completely unconnected ,
that wouldn &apos;t have affected westbrook &apos;s career .
how do you know ?
just trust me , i know .
you know i hate this guy just as much as you do ,
but this is insane .
you have to let him go .
let &apos;s just get his confession ,
then go straight to the cops .
and say what , you kidnapped a man and held him prisoner ?
we have to at least try .
i mean , we owe it to matt .
you think any of this will make a difference ?
it won &apos;t .
i &apos;m out of here .
you &apos;re not leaving .
how much have you had to drink ?
this is payback ,
for what that perve did .
he ruined our lives .
you &apos;re right !
what i did , it was wrong .
but that was in the past .
i swear to you , i &apos;ve changed .
say it again to the camera .
look , i &apos;m married .
i even have a kid on the way .
please , just let me get back to my family .
what if he &apos;s right ? what if he has changed ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re falling for these lies .
people like him don &apos;t change .
hey , chad , take it easy .
the only way you &apos;re getting out of here is in a body bag !
what are you doing ?
put the gun down , chad , all right ?
stop ! guys , chill .
what are you doing , chad ?
give me the gun !
no !
the more we learn about westbrook ,
the less i want to save him .
this isn &apos;t about him , it &apos;s about saving his victims .
according to this , back in 2005,
westbrook worked closely with a volunteer @-@ run facility
known as the sudworth place .
it &apos;s a halfway house for troubled kids .
yeah , he &apos;s still pretty active with the organization .
he made a $ 5,000 donation last year .
looks like he chaired numerous events
and even hosted overnight field trips .
that would give him the isolation he needed
to manipulate these boys .
holy moley .
last week , a former resident of the sudworth place ,
matthew jones , he committed suicide .
how ?
uh ... drug overdose .
according to his last social media post ,
he , quote , &quot; couldn &apos;t deal with the injustice of this world . &quot;
when was the funeral , garcia ?
yesterday morning .
it &apos;s no coincidence that later that night
jack westbrook went missing .
matthew &apos;s death must have been the unsub &apos;s trigger .
yeah , this is about retribution .
garcia , see who else spent time at sudworth place
around the time matthew was there .
our unsubs will be on that list .
come on , chad , get up , man . this isn &apos;t funny .
he &apos;s dead .
you killed him .
shut the hell up !
chad , get up !
what &apos;d you do ?
you saw what happened . it was an accident .
i was trying to stop him .
nobody was supposed to die .
chad was gonna kill him .
which one of you is gonna be next ?
shut up !
i need to think .
how far are you gonna take this ?
where are you going ? we all need to get out of here .
i &apos;m not going anywhere until i get what i came here for ,
and that &apos;s his confession on camera .
andrew , come on !
look where revenge has gotten you .
chad is dead .
keep and eye on him .
wait , where are you going ?
if he doesn &apos;t start talking ,
then we &apos;re gonna burn this whole place down with him in it .
i &apos;ve got more 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 on matthew jones .
he was in and out of the sudworth place
from 2002 to 2004 .
he overlapped with 22 other boys .
look for guys with spotty work histories ,
mostly working odd or solitary jobs .
not enough . give me more .
they most likely would have stayed in the area .
ok . we &apos;re getting somewhere ,
sort of somewhere . i got 6 names .
garcia , these guys went through a traumatic experience .
they would have stayed in contact with each other .
bingo . chad griffith ,
andrew ford , brian stiller .
according to social media , they have kept in contact .
only andrew and chad posted about matthew &apos;s death .
uh , andrew recently wrote about , quote ,
&quot; bringing the monsters to justice . &quot;
chad , not so much , quote ,
&quot; i could kill him with my bare hands . &quot;
two different motivations .
one wants revenge , the other wants justice .
i think we have our two unsubs .
what about the third guy brian stiller ?
he works as a janitor at the harold street motel .
he has lived and worked there for the last two years .
you think he has anything to do with this ?
we should talk to him .
say your name for the camera .
come on .
this is the only way you &apos;re gonna get out of here alive .
do you have a death wish ?
andrew &apos;s gonna be back soon .
if you don &apos;t talk ,
he &apos;s gonna burn this place down with you in it .
none of this was my idea .
i know that .
they dragged you into it .
and now you could be facing manslaughter .
you don &apos;t understand . chad was gonna--
brian , brian , brian .
you &apos;re a good kid , i know that .
i always knew you were different .
i saw what no one else could see .
not even your parents .
what are you talking about ?
you weren &apos;t like the others .
even back then .
oh , come on .
you knew you were special .
to be honest ,
you were my favorite .
the pizza and the video games .
i don &apos;t want to hear this .
remember i took you to see &quot; harry potter &quot; ?
you loved those books .
i said i don &apos;t want to hear this .
you &apos;d stay up all night reading --
stop ! just stop !
look ...
there &apos;s still time to get out of this .
there &apos;s already one dead body down here .
if i die , that makes two .
the cops will make the connection .
and guess who &apos;s taking the fall for it .
it won &apos;t be andrew .
he &apos;ll pin this whole thing on you .
i mean , after all , you &apos;re the one who killed chad .
brian , look at me .
hey , brian .
brian , look at me !
you have to end this .
get me out of here ...
and you and i can both go to the cops
and we can explain this whole thing to them .
we &apos;ll do it together .
brian stiller , fbi !
clear !
clear .
aaron , i think you might want to take a look at this .
you all right ?
you did the right thing .
what &apos;s gonna happen to andrew ?
i think you know what needs to be done .
you take care of him , i &apos;ll go deal with the cops .
but you said we &apos;d go together .
just -- just let me deal with them .
all right ?
trust me .
you go home
and you get rid of those keepsakes .
and make sure there are no loose ends .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
come on .
you thought i didn &apos;t know ?
i &apos;ve always known you and i were alike .
even when you were a little boy .
i saw that sparkle in your eye .
it &apos;s ok . shh .
it &apos;s ok , hey ?
your secret is safe with me .
hey , i found this --
what happened ? !
he gave me no choice .
i checked the main office . brian wasn &apos;t there .
according to the schedule , he &apos;s supposed to be on duty .
it looks like brian picked up where jack left off .
according to the manager ,
he left in the middle of his shift .
she came to look for him .
wouldn &apos;t want brian to miss out on the fun .
the question is ,
are they aware of what brian &apos;s been hiding ?
no doubt that would have ruined the friendship .
we can use that .
brian ...
hand me the gun .
come on , man .
come on .
you should have stuck to the plan .
why &apos;d you get him out ?
he swore he &apos;d admit to what he did
if i pulled him up .
of course he did , and you fell for it !
i tried , all right ? !
come on .
let &apos;s just burn this place down like you said
and pretend this never happened .
ok . thanks , hotch .
they found several photos of underage boys .
he &apos;d been keeping their underwear as souvenirs .
what brian &apos;s done is rare .
statistically , very few victims of molestation
become predators themselves .
we searched andrew and chad &apos;s apartment .
came up empty .
spoke to a neighbor ,
said she hadn &apos;t seen them in a few days .
well , make sure you keep
a couple of your guys back to patrol the area
just in case they surface .
i &apos;ll get on it .
hey , sweetness , tell me something good .
i did some snooping into chad and his bank account .
he &apos;s been regularly depositing checks
from a vbh construction .
they have a site
that got shut down due to permit issues .
guess where it &apos;s located .
right in the middle of the comfort zone .
must be where they &apos;re holding jack .
here &apos;s the address .
thanks , mama .
all right , ready ?
that &apos;s the last of it .
fbi , don &apos;t move !
don &apos;t come any closer ! i mean it !
put the weapon down .
what the hell are you doing ?
where are jack and chad ?
they &apos;re dead .
n @-@ nobody was supposed to die .
andrew , put the gun down .
can &apos;t do that .
listen to her , drew .
shut up , brian , i got this .
let us help you .
help us ?
where were you when we needed you ?
you have no idea what that man did to us .
we were just kids !
yes , i do .
hey , i said back up !
just listen to me . just listen .
i &apos;m putting this away .
kid , you don &apos;t want to do this .
just give me the gun .
and you have my word that i &apos;ll get you a confession .
who are you talking about ?
westbrook is dead .
you just gotta trust me on this , man .
why would i trust you ?
because the same thing happened to me when i was a kid .
what happened to you happened to me .
i &apos;m not lying .
think about this .
this is the rest of your life , man .
you don &apos;t want to go out like this .
come on , look around . look around .
a confession &apos;s not gonna mean
a damn thing if you &apos;re dead .

brian stiller , you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against you .

&quot; our moral responsibility is not to stop the future ,
but to shape it .
to channel our destiny in humane directions
and to ease the trauma of transition . &quot;

how do you compartmentalize cases like these ?
believe it or not , these are the good ones ,
knowing that these guys are locked up
and that they can &apos;t hurt any more innocent children .
