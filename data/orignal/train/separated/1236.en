He did this to these girls and then he put it up on a wall
for everyone to see. He was in this building!
These things are gonna have me knocked out for a while.
There's a spare key.
Did you get what you were looking for?
Lorenzo, I--
Don't.
They're gonna kill my brother
And I don't really even know him.
Mrs. Dilaurentis gave money to the Carissimi Group
to support Charles.
You must be Rhys Matthews?
That guy looks exactly like--
Exactly like a Dilaurentis.
We had birthday cake
that day at the arcade when Jason and I met him.
He said it was the best birthday he ever had.
I've been thinking about what I want.
Your friend Clark
he was meeting some guy named Rhys Matthews.
he works for the Carissimi Group
and we think that he might be working for Charles.
I'm sure they took your feelings into consideration.
And, yes, it sucks but it came from up high.
What? The police?
The school board.
What?
They think your attendance could endanger
the other students' safety.
And from what I understand about the gallery situation
I don't completely disagree.
I do.
They can't punish us.
It's not a punishment.
Really?
Being disinvited to your own prom?
What would you call it?
A blessing.
If Charles, A, whatever he calls himself
was bold enough to pull that stunt with the photos
he's not gonna be scared to crash a school party.
Well, then, fill the ballroom with police.
It's a fairy-tale theme. They can come as the village idiots.
You can still celebrate that night
in a quiet, more intimate way.
Veronica's offered to host a small gathering
in the backyard barn.
You're kidding me.
Seriously?
Why not?
Because it's filled with Melissa's stuff.
How is that a banquet hall?
You can roll up a rug.
And what?
Take our prom picture on top of a washer-dryer?
Hanna, you don't have a choice.
If the school board doesn't want you at prom
or commencement..
Commencement? Wait.
We were barred from that too?
So now we're not gonna graduate?
You will graduate.
You just won't be walking across the stage
to get your diploma. You'll be...
walking to the mailbox.
Unbelievable.
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
I've spent the past two weeks
writing that stupid valedictorian speech
that I didn't even wanna give in the first place.
Honey, the circumstances have changed
since you started that speech.
I know. It went from a pity-toss to a humiliation-hurl.
Please, stop focusing on what you don't have
and focus on the fact that you're here
and you have four dear friends to celebrate with.
That barn is not big enough for us, our dates
and our poufy dresses.
You'll open a window.
That's what she said?
Oh, no. There was more.
She said something about hanging twinkly lights
on Melissa's shower curtain.
But by that time, I was already halfway up the stairs.
I guess it could be worse.
Really? How?
I'm thinking.
Ali, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Even if we went to the real prom
who would we hang out with besides each other?
That's true.
Everyone would just stare at us like we were in some fishbowl.
And we wouldn't be safe.
We already know that Charles has some twisted thing for formals.
We've already been to one psycho-prom that he hosted.
Have you spoken to Clark?
No, I've left him, like, five messages.
Did you mention who we saw him meet up with?
You didn't give me a name.
What about Charles?
He goes by Rhys.
Don't sweat it, Ali. He'll forgive you.
If it were his brother on the suspect board
he would have done the same thing.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Could you call me?
I don't know if, if you went out of town
or if your phone is not working,
but I really need to talk to you, Clark.
Call me.
Shouldn't the police be leaving these messages..
And not you?
Aria, if, if you and your friends think
that this guy is in any way connected to Charles--
I thought a lot of my friends were connected.
Well, just look at what happened with Andrew Campbell.
He can barely say my name without spitting.
Mom, what are you doing here?
Have you checked your emails?
No, why?
What, am I banned from here too?
The contest judges finally saw your work.
You won first prize, Aria.
What does that mean?
It means there's a cash prize
and an internship waiting for you in L.A.
Congratulations!
It starts the Monday after school ends.
That's fantastic. Right?
Wait, what if the police haven't caught him by then?
Well, honey, we have to believe
that they're closer than you think.
Yeah, but what if they're not?
I can't just go and hop on a plane.
What about my friends?
None of us can move on until this thing is over.
Aria, have-have you been threatened by Charles since the gallery?
No, but that doesn't mean he's retired.
He's probably waiting for me at baggage claim.
Aria, don't go there. Let's just try and live in the moment.
Really? What moment?
For all we know, Charles is in Spencer's barn right now
installing a lethal disco ball. Which would make sense.
That's where this whole nightmare started.
You need a sandwich.
Would it help if I were there?
Where?
At Spencer's.
The-the barn prom.
I thought you said that you..
That was when I was gonna be sharing a punch bowl
with a bunch of former students.
If you want me there, I will be there.
Unless I have to dress up like a troll or something.
I don't, do I?
So, why New York?
My dad has some work there
so he thought it would be cool
if we spent a few days together.
Well, can't you come home earlier so you don't miss the prom?
We're all missing it.
You said we're just hanging out in spencer's barn
watching Molly Ringwald movies.
We could do that any day.
Yeah, you know what?
You're right. It doesn't matter anyway.
It's just a pity prom.
What?
What's wrong?
Why are you bringing an industrial strength laptop with you?
My dad wanted me to bring it.
He's... slowly morphing into a techno geek.
One of his clients wanted him to build cabinets
for all of his electronic toys.
Hey, what do you want from New York?
Nothing. Honestly.
At least let me get you a new helmet.
Will you stop?
Will you let me do something?
Will you go to prom with me?
Sorry, that's..
not how I wanted to ask you.
I... did wanna ask you, but..
if-if you think it's weird..
Yeah, it's weird.
I get it.
Prom is so much pressure.
But this one's different. It's just us and--
Emily, my old school has their prom the same night
and I told Claire and some of my--
You shouldn't have to choose.
We'll just do something special together another time.
Toby, wait!
What are you doing here?
I just got your message, okay?
They can't suspend you. This is all my fault--
Spencer..
Just let me talk to Tanner.
She needs to know that I sent you to the arcade
and that the candy was meant for me.
You had no idea what was in it.
Stop. You didn't make me go there.
That was my choice.
Yeah.
But Lorenzo would never have gotten hurt if you weren't stoned.
And you never would have been stoned
if I had just admitted how messed up I was
when I came out of this place.
Look, what happened happened.
Maybe it was for the best.
How?
'Cause that freak knows we're closing in on him
and the police are gonna catch him whether I'm on the force or not.
How long?
Indefinitely.
There's an investigation and a hearing.
Let me say something. Please?
They're not interested in anything you have to say.
I gotta go. I'm expected in there.
I'm gonna call you later.
Wait, before you call his dad
why don't you just talk to Caleb directly?
There is no directly. He's not answering his phone.
I'm calling his dad.
What's that?
It's a necklace my grandmother gave me.
I wore it to my prom.
I thought maybe...
Hanna would wanna wear it too.
She's probably wearing sweats.
What? Why? You all bought beautiful dresses.
Yeah, and those dresses are now gonna be our dates.
No one wants to put on a ball gown and get splinters in their butt.
It's not that kind of barn.
It's that kind of a prom.
Why isn't Caleb coming?
Caleb's in New York.
Yep, everyone's kind of scattered.
Emily...
you all have been robbed of so much already.
Senior prom only comes around once.
Downsized or not, dates or no dates.
You guys should put on those dresses and dance and..
feel beautiful.
Well, I guess I'll give this to her another time.
What's going on?
Caleb's not going to New York.
He packed that rambo-laptop
because he's gonna hunt a down himself.
Okay, how do you know that he's--
What else would it be, Emily?
That's why he's been awol.
And now he's gone all vigilante
and he still doesn't think that he's gonna get himself killed.
Answer your phone, damn it.
Hello?
Charles?
Is that you?
I can't go to that school prom.
I'm not gonna be there.
Please. Charles, talk to me.
Sorry I'm late. My physical therapist is a talker.
Can I get you a coffee or...
No, I'm good.
What's this about?
Well, how is your arm?
Still attached.
Are you still in a lot of pain?
Spencer, you didn't call me here for a medical update.
And you don't have to apologize again.
It's not about me.
It's about Alison.
Look, I understand why you're angry.
Okay, stealing that keycard was stupid and it was impulsive,
and it put you in a really terrible position.
But she just didn't think it through.
You sure about that?
Because ever since I got to Rosewood, all I've heard about Alison
is how she's a master planner and manipulator.
Yeah, but you didn't believe that.
You gave her a chance.
I gave her more than that.
And look where we are.
Look... Lorenzo, um..
I know how you feel.
I mean, I have been used and abused by that girl
more times than I could possibly count.
But she has changed.
She's been through so much.
And she's desperate.
And I know that she needs you.
No, I think she got what she needed.
I think you're wrong.
Alison's never had anyone like you in her whole life.
Somebody who saw something in her that was vulnerable...
and genuine.
I did...
But I don't anymore.
And there's... really no way you could ever forgive her?
Not yet.
Okay. Okay. Look.
If you change your mind...
We're having a promette..
in the barn behind my house tonight.
And maybe you could... surprise her.
Maybe you could surprise yourself.
Is that all seafood?
That looks delicious.
Do you want me to run it out to the girls?
Oh, God, no. This is for us.
They're having nachos.
Did Spencer give you a hard time about having us here?
I know Aria was not thrilled
that I was gonna be 30 feet from her prom.
You were closer to her when you were her English teacher.
What was that?
Was that thunder or music?
That was probably Hanna parking.
Sorry.
I wasn't expecting to know
both the cops out front.
Did that get us any insider info?
Are they closer to finding him?
I'm afraid that would take more than a Pecan Sandie.
Besides, these aren't high-ranking officers
so they wouldn't know anything.
Well, as long as they stay awake for the next three hours
I am just grateful they're out there.
Would anyone like a glass of cabernet?
I don't think so.
Not tonight.
No, I'll-I'll pass.
Well, I'm not driving.
You know, since it's open..
I'll have one.
Me too.
You'll forward this to me, right?
Yeah. Don't talk. Just smile.
Oh, no, you're not done.
I want some on my phone.
Toby, can you just call someone at the station?
Hanna, when I turned in my badge
I got frostbite.
I can't call in any favors right now.
Okay, if Caleb has some crazy plan and you know about it--
I don't.
Look at me when you say that.
I don't know what Caleb is up to right now. I swear.
How did he keep this a secret for so long?
Not just him. Both of them.
I mean, she was visiting him and letting Kenneth
believe that their son was dead.
I could never keep something like that from my husband.
Oh, please. You can't compare yourself to that family.
Lying is like oxygen to them.
I mean, Jason didn't even know that he wasn't Kenneth's..
Oh, Gosh, I spilled.
Not enough.
Okay, newsflash.
Guess who Noel Kahn brought to the prom?
Bridget Woo. And check this out.
She's 85% tequila
and her dress is on backwards.
You okay?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Wow. Bridget really should've gone with a zipper.
Wait till Ali sees this.
Where is she?
Alison?
Where do you think? She likes to make an entrance.
Am I supposed to know these people?
No. You're just supposed to be looking at their outfits.
Wait, is that a-a lantern or a hat?
That's her hair.
Wait, Lucas took Jenna to the prom? Seriously?
No, they're just standing next to each other.
Yeah, holding hands.
She's tipping him.
She probably thinks he Uber-ed her there.
Oh, my God.
Did you guys just...
Yeah.
Why? What's wrong?
Alison went to prom.
He must've lured her there.
Who did? Why is she there?
She's hoping to meet Charles.
Veronica, I'm sorry.
We shouldn't have made you tell that story
about Peter and Jessica.
Believe me, it was easier telling it than living it.
Amen. Been there, done that.
I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
What's worse is I can't even spend time out here anymore
without being reminded of that woman.
That's where the dog dug her up.
I completely forgot.
Well... some of us can't.
Should we check on the girls?
I think we should check on our host.
The girls are fine.
Clark.
Hey.
You are here.
Yeah, it's my prom.
What are you doing here?
Taking pictures.
You don't go to school here, Clark.
You're in college.
Who hired you?
Someone on the prom committee saw my pictures
at the contest.
Look, I..
I didn't wanna rub it in your face
when I found out you were off the guest list.
I'm sorry.
My friends saw you, Clark.
At that old doll factory.
What were you doing there? Who were you meeting?
I don't think you wanna be photographing her.
Get one of the ice sculpture before it melts.
And I suggest you and your pals
find the exit. Voluntarily.
不要寻找狼 看见红色就够了 时间在流逝...
Veronica, maybe you should eat something.
This is a beautiful tray.
I love it.
It wasn't bad enough
that this bitch tried to steal my husband
but her sicko son had to bury her in our backyard.
Is it crystal?
J-just ten feet away from my Lilacs.
Maybe we should put on some music.
This deranged freak tried to frame my entire family.
Maybe it wasn't Charles.
I mean, I know that he put our daughters through hell
but I'm just saying that maybe we can't pin all of this on him.
You can't possibly be defending--
No, no, not at all, I'm just
I'm just saying that
maybe somebody else buried Jessica out there.
Like who?
Like her husband.
I mean, from what I've heard,
it could be revenge.
For all the years she kept this kid a secret.
Maybe he wanted Peter to discover the body.
Maybe... we should ask him.
Who?
Kenneth.
Where are you going?
To get an answer.
What? Wait. No, you can't do that.
Oh, watch me.
Ali, why didn't you come to the barn?
Did you hear from Charles? Did he text you?
So what if he did?
I didn't ask you guys to follow me here!
You're gonna scare him away just like the arcade.
Alison--
Please. Let me go.
Just leave me alone. I know what I'm doing.
Sara?
How did you know I...
I stopped by the barn.
It was empty, so I figured...
You aren't upset, are you?
No.
Of course not. I just..
I can't believe you'd leave your prom to come to--
This is where I felt I should be.
I didn't want the night to pass
without at least one great dance... with you.
Hello?
Kenneth?
Are you here?
Kenneth?
Why was the door open?
Maybe he just stepped out. His car is out there.
Did you close that door?
I'm not leaving my fingerprints on that.
Ken?
If you're up there, come down.
It's Veronica. I have a question for ya.
Veronica, please don't.
You don't want to do this tonight.
Oh, the hell I don't. Kenneth!
I know you're here. I can see your scotch.
What's wrong?
What is that?
That's from the police.
It's an envelope they use for evidence.
Is that..
It must be.
Don't do this.
Let go.
Look, if we scared him off, just consider it a gift.
Please leave while you can.
You didn't get his text. He wasn't threatening.
Ali.
I have to meet him.
Please don't follow your worst instincts.
You don't get it.
You've never understood me.
You never even liked me.
What are you talking about?
He's not your brother, Spencer. He's mine.
And I am not leaving until I can look him in the eye
and ask him why.
What did I ever do to make him hate me?
Caleb, where have you been? Why are you here?
Why are you here? You're not supposed to be.
And you said you were in New York.
Which was a lie. I talked to your dad.
You were never there.
Yes, I was.
Why? What are you doing over there?
I can't talk about it.
Do I need to make an appointment?
No. You need to dance with me.
I'm not dancing with you.
Yes, you are.
I'm wearing the suit that you picked out for me
and it was a really long ride.
Just one dance... and then we'll talk.
I'm confused. Is Mr. Dilaurentis here or not?
We're not sure.
Are any of you part of the Dilaurentis family?
Are you?
We're neighbors. We were just--
No, wait, hold it.
I live next door. What is your business here?
I'm from the Carissimi Group.
A foundation that was sponsored
by Mr. Dilaurentis' late wife.
I had some questions for him.
Maybe I'll come back at a better time.
You know, maybe we should--
Hanna thinks the Carissimi Group is connected to Charles.
I think we just met Charles.
Charles? Is that you?
Dominic.
Punch?
Thank you.
What's she doing now?
Sipping. What about him?
Shooting Mindy and Cindy.
You know, may-maybe he's telling the truth.
Or he's here
because he texted Alison for his boss.
Well, he is a legitimate photographer.
Well, he must've tricked her into this.
He's seriously freaking me out.
Hey, relax. I'm here.
Why would she say that?
Why would she say that I never even liked her?
Well, because she hasn't always been
the easiest person to like.
Yeah, but we came here to protect her.
That's all any of us have been trying to do for weeks.
Years.
We basically missed out on our high school experience
trying to solve the mystery that is Alison.
The only reason we survived is because we had each other.
Is that what your speech is about?
For commencement?
Oh, my god.
Just forget about the stupid speech.
Nobody's ever gonna hear it.
Thanks again. You didn't have to do this.
Emily, I just want you to know
whatever happens..
...you mean a lot to me.
Ezra..
...I don't want you to come with me to LA.
What?
When I go there this summer for my internship..
...I need to go alone.
I saw your airline confirmation on your phone.
I...I know that you bought a ticket to LA.
Ahem, did you also see that it was a..
...a layover on my way to Thailand?
What?
Yeah, it's a, it's a connecting flight.
I'm not following you to LA, Aria.
But I'm not..
...sticking around here either.
I just, I-I decided to join the Habitat Group
sooner rather than later.
Oh, you're going to Thailand for the summer?
Yeah.
Do you think that's a mistake?
No. God, no. I..
That's a great idea.
You need to move on.
Yeah.
A change could be good for both of us.
Yeah.
Did you write about your friends?
I wrote about what it means to support someone unconditionally
even when they haven't been entirely honest with you.
And how everybody needs somebody to be inspired by.
Somebody who sets the bar really high.
Somebody who'll put someone else's needs
before their own..
...and then not resent them for it.
Somebody who always expects you to do the right thing..
...and then forgives you when you don't.
I think your mother would be pretty moved by that.
Yeah, she might be.
But I wrote it about you.
Crap.
What?
We lost her.
Are there more pictures of him around here?
How much more do you need to see?
They clearly share the same DNA.
We do not need to be looking for more photographs.
If we really think that's Charles,
there are two cop cars sitting outside.
Jessica probably had her secret stash of old photos.
No, no, no. We are not opening drawers now.
That is trespassing.
What was that?
It came from the basement.
That's where he is.
No, no, no, wait.
Kenneth?
Are you here? I wanna talk to you.
Look, we know you're here. We heard you.
What just happened?
Who locked that?
Open the door!
Come on!
Open the door!
Okay, you said one dance.
This is more than I danced at the Katy Perry concert.
If you were in New York, what were you doing there?
Getting a job.
What? You already have a job.
Not one that will pay for a move to New York.
Yeah, that job is called bank robber.
And who's moving to New York?
We are.
If that's still your dream.
Hanna, I-I had to sign a waiver.
But...I'm officially an information risk analyst.
What's that?
I keep the hackers out.
For who?
I can't even tell you the name of the company.
Caleb.
Hannah, it's real. Okay?
And it pays enough to cover your tuition
and a place for us to live
that's bigger than that girl's hair.
Wait, so this has nothing to do with A?
Just getting away from him.
Let's find another way outta here.
Who slammed the door? Don't tell me that was just the wind.
The wind has a name. Charles.
And we were in the same room as that animal.
I'm sure he's still upstairs.
No, he's probably in my yard
on his way to the barn.
Okay, there are police right outside.
Who cannot hear us.
Why didn't any of us bring a phone?
Okay, let's find another way out.
What is this? What's behind this?
天 你的眼睛这么大 好好利用起来 时间快到了
Move!
What's the rush, Clark?
We know who hired you for this party.
Where is he? Where's Charles?
Look, get out of the way.
You guys are totally off base.
Whose photo did you plan on shooting with this?
Look, get your hands off of me, alright?
You guys have no idea what you're doing.
Actually, I do. I'm an officer.
So am I.
Wait. W-what's going on here?
Is it true? Is that real?
Wait a minute.
That whole time in the dark room,
when I met you at Hollis...
How?
Undercover, Aria.
Now, please let me go do my job.
It's probably already too late.
You really had no idea?
None.
Well, at least you were safer than you thought.
Where's Alison? Is she with Clark?
We don't know.
Charles.
Stay there. Don't move.
What?
现在只剩我们俩了
Shouldn't we just call the police?
Clark and I already called for backup.
Where are the others?
Hanna and Caleb are checking the coatrooms.
Aria was checking the bathrooms.
Somebody should check the kitchens.
Where's Alison?
Is she not here?
She was, but..
We can't find her.
But we will.
Someone should check with the parking guys.
I'll-I'll go check the exits.
I'll come with you.
Lorenzo.
Thank you for coming.
Did you see any access to the backyard?
No, I couldn't see access to my right hand.
It's pitch black and very tight,
and I think there's something rotting in there.
Please don't ask me to do that again.
How are we gonna get outta here?
How did they get through it?
Our girls.
They went through this and much worse.
We had one job tonight.
One.
To keep them safe.
Emily. This is Ali's phone.
Do you think this is--
Yeah, who else?
What's going on?
Is that Ali's phone?
Where are you taking me? Where are we going?
Please...Charles.
Talk to me.
