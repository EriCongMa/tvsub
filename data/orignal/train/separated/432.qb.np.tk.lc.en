criminal minds s07e06
it would be nice if we saw each other
more than once every 3 or 4 years .
so , give me the updates .
anybody serious in your life ?
no , there isn &apos;t .
i think she &apos;s putting some feelers out
to see if that old spark is still there .
is it ?
i &apos;m crazy , right ?
we don &apos;t always get second chances in life , rossi .
hey , what &apos;s going on with you ?
last year i was diagnosed with als ,
lou gehrig &apos;s disease .
it won &apos;t be long now .
i came to ask you ,
when it &apos;s time , will you help me end my life ?
cool night ,
still water ,
just the way the fish like it .
you could at least act like you &apos;re having fun .
mom told me never to lie .
no one likes a smart @-@ ass .
you haven &apos;t caught anything either .
can we go in now ?
not until we hook our dinner .
i thought you were drinking yours tonight .
what did you say ?
you got a real attitude problem , you know that ?
take your shirt off .
sorry .
sir , it won &apos;t happen again .
take your shirt off .
you &apos;re never gonna grow up to be a man
if you don &apos;t learn respect .
no wonder your mother left .
she couldn &apos;t face having a worthless ...
arrogant ...
bastard for a son .
nick . nick ! wake up .
we saw something going on across the lake ,
so we left to check it out .
what do you mean , you guys left ?
listen , bro , we tried to wake you .
dude , you gotta get over here .
how ? you took the canoes .
there are police everywhere .
they found a body in the lake .
look across .
got another one . can you give me a hand ?
hold it .
they &apos;ve-- there &apos;s another body .
i can &apos;t see anything . come back and get me .
ok . sam is heading your way now .
she &apos;ll be there in a couple of minutes .
who &apos;s that with you ?
what ? no one .
i &apos;m alone .
nick , look out !
nick ! nick , are you there ?
nick !
nick ! what the hell is going on ? !
i so don &apos;t miss that face .
no matter how many cases we solve , there &apos;s always more .
insert dr . reid &apos;s statistic about active serial killers
at any given time here .
reid ?
spencer ...
there &apos;s something wrong .
why do you say that ?
he &apos;s been reading the same page
for 16 minutes and 24 seconds .
maybe it &apos;s a really good article .
it &apos;s never taken him longer than 11 minutes ,
17 seconds to turn a page .
you time how long it ...
what &apos;s your theory ?
i &apos;m extrapolating probabilities as we speak .
oh , hey . rossi , you think you could help me
with a consult for wildwood pd ?
sure .
now , that i noticed .
is something going on ?
how did it go the other night ?
what happened the other night ?
you ok ?
well , why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
you seem distracted .
i &apos;m considering a purchase .
come on , now , rossi , you know we &apos;re not buying that .
what &apos;s really going on ?
look , it was a late night with ringo
and not enough coffee .
i mean , the guy &apos;s a world @-@ class drummer ,
but don &apos;t think i didn &apos;t wipe the floor with him in rock band .
all right , what do you think ?
he could be telling the truth .
i only played him to the easy level .
i can &apos;t tell .
and you never will .
let &apos;s get started .
ok , this is ridge canyon lake
in california &apos;s angeles national forest .
it &apos;s a popular destination for water sport enthusiasts .
unfortunately , some campers have discovered
someone has chosen murder as their sport of choice .
3 victims , all male , all found early this morning .
he used an underwater disposal site ?
he weighed them down with rocks
and then he hid their bodies
underneath shrubbery around the lake &apos;s edge .
that &apos;s pretty risky , keeping a graveyard at a popular lake .
this guy is showing confidence early .
well , we should run priors in the area .
this might not be his first party .
all 3 victims were reported missing last week ,
and each of the bodies was discovered
more than 30 miles from where they went missing .
any indication of sexual assault ?
no external signs , but time
in the water might have destroyed evidence .
autopsies are being conducted now .
and i &apos;m gonna make matters worse .
this is nick skirvin and he was abducted early this morning .
witness reports indicate a blitz attack .
his friends were on the water
and saw a figure strike nick from behind
just before they lost contact .
could they give a description ?
probably white , definitely male .
nothing more specific . they said the unsub
had dragged nick into the woods by the time they reached the shore .
fast and efficient ,
and he is unafraid of a heavy police presence .
if he &apos;s dumping the bodies in one location ,
it &apos;s a good bet the area means something to him .
he probably lives in or near the forest .
unfortunately , angeles national forest
1,016 square miles of terrain ,
ranging in elevation from 1,200 to 10,064 feet .
which means that if the unsub is familiar with the area ,
nick skirvin could be anywhere .
no !
that &apos;s not why mom left .
what did you say ?
i said , that &apos;s not why mom left .
is that right ?
she said &apos; cause your rod was broken .
and this whole time , i thought she was talking about fishing !
&quot; to die is poignantly bitter ,
&quot; but the idea of having to die
without having lived is unbearable . &quot;
erich fromm .
with no apparent evidence
of physical violence or sexual assault ,
we could be looking at an unsub
who gets off on the torture of drowning .
so what &apos;s the significance of the water burial ?
is he visiting the dump sites to relive his crimes ,
or is he using it as a forensic countermeasure ?
it could be both .
if the dump site &apos;s doubling as his trophy collection ,
he won &apos;t be happy it &apos;s been disturbed .
he &apos;ll want to make a new one quickly .
uh , guys , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s just happened .
nick skirvin &apos;s body has been recovered ,
only it wasn &apos;t found in ridge canyon ,
it was found in lake banter ,
which is 20 miles away . visual aid to follow .
and postscript , you do not want to know
how many hits you get if you google this forest plus murder .
to say it should be called the angeles national unsub dump site
is an understatement .
how was the body recovered so quickly ?
it wasn &apos;t way down . nick &apos;s body was just found
at the edge of the lake by some campers .
garcia , start compiling a
list of missing persons and crimes in the area .
faster than a hotch rocket .
so the unsub knew that his burial site had been compromised ,
and he adapted by venturing outside his comfort zone .
and he changed his victimology .
look at nick skirvin compared to the other 3 victims .
they were all dark @-@ haired , well @-@ built men ,
but nick is an average blond .
he could be an impulsive kill ,
not thought out like the others .
then why not submerge the body ?
allowing it to be uncovered so soon seems counterintuitive
to the self @-@ preservation instincts he &apos;s displayed so far .
the disturbance of his old disposal site
could have thrown him off his game .
or he &apos;s trying to shake us .
by using another lake ,
he just doubled the size of his killing field .
and our search area .
this is even more isolated than ridge canyon .
he &apos;s gotta be local .
hey , did your team come this way ?
all right , it looks like he dragged nick up through here .
that path comes from the direction of the road .
there &apos;s no waterway connecting the two lakes .
it &apos;s 44 miles from the abduction site .
with the forest smack in between .
a truck or a camper would conceal his victims .
if he &apos;s dragging his victims ,
he &apos;s probably too weak to carry them .
he might have switched to a smaller target
to help navigate his terrain .
he also he didn &apos;t weigh this body down .
maybe he can &apos;t complete his ritual without the proper surrogate .
if that &apos;s the case , then killing nick
didn &apos;t get the unsub his release .
he &apos;s already looking for his next victim .
ok . so , we all need life vests .
we can get them at the rental shack .
i think it &apos;s right up here .
洛杉矶国家森林
we were on the two @-@ way ...
and then he was gone .
i never should have left him .
you said you saw a man at the campsite ?
we were too far away to help .
i paddled as hard as i could , but ...
phinny .
this wasn &apos;t your fault .
try telling that to my parents .
you find the son of a bitch who killed my brother .
we will . but first i need to know ,
is it possible that nick met someone at the lake
that would have followed him ?
we hung out with a lot of people last night .
there was a party on the beach .
did nick make any new friends ?
nick always makes friends .
do you remember if anyone stuck out ,
looked like they didn &apos;t belong ?
ok , thank you , ma &apos;am . bye .
anything ?
unsub blends in with a younger crowd .
i &apos;d say we &apos;re looking at mid @-@ 20s to early 30s. you ?
well , he &apos;s methodical .
social , too . he &apos;s been able to isolate all of his victims .
the mother of jake shepherd , our first victim ,
said there were several
members of their church at the lake that day .
but jake was the only one with brown hair .
he matched the age preference of the unsub .
nick &apos;s brother phinny &apos;s a brunet ,
and he &apos;s a lot like these guys .
why not go after him ?
i don &apos;t know .
he chose nick skirvin for a reason .
we need to figure out why .
damn it .
i &apos;m out of gas !
all the victims were drowned ,
but the first victim , jake shepherd , was asphyxiated
before being submerged .
jake was the biggest . the unsub may have had to strangle him
to render him unconscious for the drowning .
he wasn &apos;t just unconscious .
there was pretty intense damage to the trachea .
he was dead before going in the water .
but with nick , he used a blow to the head to incapacitate him ,
so this unsub wants his victims alive when he drowns them .
this is the interesting part .
in all 4 victims , evidence of broken ribs
and damage to the sternum indicate severe chest compression ,
yet there are no signs of external trauma .
so somebody attempted to perform cpr on these victims ?
and was successful . inflammation to the lungs
indicates matter expulsion prior to brain death .
he kills them , then resuscitates them . why ?
we &apos;ve seen hero complexes before .
rodney alcala killed and resuscitated his victims .
these unsubs get off on the
power of bringing people back from the dead .
well , he &apos;s not a very good hero , is he ?
his victims didn &apos;t survive .
dr. carroll , is it possible to tell
if any of these victims were resuscitated more than once ?
the indicator is the inflammation of the lungs ,
combined with broken ribs . severe inflammation could
theoretically point toward multiple resuscitations .
ok , given that theory , how many of the 4 ?
all but the first victim , jake shepherd .
the guy might have tried , but with the damage to jake &apos;s throat ,
he wouldn &apos;t have been able to expel the water from his lungs .
you need a hand ?
yeah .
hi , i &apos;m--i &apos;m chase . here .
lacey .
here , let me help you with that .
i thought i was never gonna get this thing out .
the damn thing ran out of gas .
oh , no worries . i &apos;ll give you a lift back to the dock .
i should probably stay with the jet ski .
are you kidding ? didn &apos;t you hear what happened this morning ?
the bodies ?
yeah , it &apos;s crazy , right ?
who knows where that guy is ?
better that thing be on its own than you .
you &apos;re right .
it looks like we &apos;re definitely looking at a sadist .
killing them once isn &apos;t enough .
he has to resuscitate his victims
until he can &apos;t bring them back again .
so why the change from choking to multiple drowning ?
with the damage to jake &apos;s throat ,
the unsub wasn &apos;t able to successfully resuscitate him .
resuscitating them makes him feel more powerful .
which means he has no power in his everyday life .
but the change in victimology is interesting .
nick skirvin was the smallest ,
but he had the most defensive wounds on his body .
he fought back the most .
maybe the unsub was injured in one of the attacks .
he &apos;s targeting easier prey to complete his end game .
excuse me .
there &apos;s something else .
the m.e. tested diatom levels in the bodies
and it turns out the unsub drowns his victims
at different locations every time ,
not just where he abducts
them or where the bodies are later discovered .
well , that &apos;s pretty risky ,
considering the community &apos;s on full alert .
this guy &apos;s intelligent , resourceful ,
and criminally sophisticated .
why is transporting the bodies so important to him ?
come on , lacey , please ? wake up .
wake up !
wake up !
come on !
wake up !
wake up ! wake up !
chase , wake up !
damn it , wake up !
stop .
he killed a woman this time . this guy &apos;s all over the map .
diatom readings indicate
he didn &apos;t move the body after he drowned her .
postmortem wounds--overkill consistent with rage .
is he unraveling because we took away his underwater graveyard ?
she lasted longer in the fight than nick skirvin .
this feels desperate .
take a look at this .
there was blood on the body that didn &apos;t match type to the victim .
it shows a severely low white blood cell count .
i &apos;m running tests to be more conclusive .
if this unsub is sick and getting weak ,
it would explain why he &apos;s no longer weighing his victims down .
the only consistency to his m.o.
is the drowning and resuscitation .
that &apos;s what &apos;s most important to him .
if that &apos;s the case , i &apos;d say he isn &apos;t too happy right now .
why is that ?
there &apos;s bruising consistent with cpr ,
but no inflammation of the lungs ,
no signs of expulsion .
she wasn &apos;t successfully revived .
the unsub , or unknown subject we &apos;re looking for
is a white male in his mid- to late 20s .
he dumped nick skirvin &apos;s body in banter lake
and then was compelled to circle back to ridge canyon .
we believe , therefore , that he &apos;s local to the area .
this unsub is a sadist with a god complex .
he gets off by killing his victims over and over again .
but it &apos;s vital that he &apos;s able to bring them back from the dead .
he went from choking and carrying fit men to their watery graves
to drowning and dumping smaller victims unceremoniously .
diatom levels indicate that
he has now stopped moving his victims altogether .
i &apos;m sorry , diatom levels ?
diatoms are algae in water
that help us pinpoint time and location of drowning .
because of the changes to his behavior ,
we believe he &apos;s most likely been injured or sick .
he &apos;s definitely experienced in cpr .
we need to look at doctors , lifeguards ,
anyone with training in resuscitation .
you should put younger cops on the lakes undercover ,
see if they can lure him out .
the smaller , less imposing ones you can find , the better .
we could grab a couple guys from the academy .
perfect . but move quickly .
he &apos;s accelerated his attack schedule .
he won &apos;t wait long to strike again .
damn it . where &apos;s the spare ?
i think that is the spare .
of course there &apos;s no reception .
there was a gas station ,
about a mile back . you want me to hoof it ,
see if they have any tires ?
no , you stay with the car . the walk will calm me down .
mom .
what ?
are you kidding me ?
i think after this i deserve one .
and i deserve a mother who lives to see me graduate .
you &apos;re a good son .
no matter what anyone else might say .
funny .
i &apos;ll be back within an hour .
no getting a pack at the station either .
love you .
i take it that wasn &apos;t ringo inviting you to another party
on the phone yesterday .
it was carolyn .
she has als .
rossi , i &apos;m--
what do you need ?
it &apos;s not what i need , emily .
it &apos;s what she &apos;s asking me to do .
the disease is acting quickly .
carolyn is already suffering ,
and she doesn &apos;t want to go out that way .
she wants to die on her own terms .
and when this case is over and we get back ...
she asked if i would help her do it .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t have a choice .
oh , god .
is everything ok , ma &apos;am ?
can you help me , please ? i got a flat just up the road
and my son evan is waiting on me .
sure . hop in . i &apos;ll give you a lift .
thanks .
that was dr . carroll . preliminary test results
show the unsub has cancer of the blood . he &apos;s dying .
all right , wait a minute .
witnesses said jake shepherd , the first victim ,
was out on the lake for a baptism , right ?
he was with his congregation .
well , those water burials can be seen
as a form of baptism , too .
especially dealing with an unsub who has a god complex .
what if there &apos;s a religious or
spiritual motivation to why the unsub is doing this ?
speak and be heard .
garcia , i need you to pull a list of patients in the area
with any form of blood cancer .
i will make hippa my bitch , sir .
i also need information on jake shepherd .
religious ties , spiritual background , anything .
oh , all that information will make for a fast search .
give me a mo .... spiritual ,
something heaven sent , other than my angelic self .
jake shepherd joined the church
after a near @-@ death experience changed his life .
what happened to him ?
he was in an atv accident , he coded for 4 minutes ,
he was life @-@ flighted to l.a. where they managed to revive him ,
but clinically he did die .
death and resuscitation .
that sounds a little too
similar to our unsub &apos;s m.o. to be a coincidence .
all right , garcia , dig deeper .
jake shepherd &apos;s death wasn &apos;t random .
it &apos;s on like obi @-@ wan .
garcia out .
so a terminally ill unsub targets a man
who came back from the dead and then starts killing repeatedly .
i mean , am i crazy , or is this about a guy
trying to come to terms with his own death ?
finding out you &apos;re gonna die
isn &apos;t enough to make somebody a psychopath .
it does , however , explain why he stopped strangling his victims .
how do you find out about death ?
you ask someone who died .
is he bringing these victims back so he can talk to them ?
evan . are you evan ?
are you evan ? is--is your name evan ?
is your mom samantha ?
yeah , that &apos;s me . what &apos;s going on ?
you have to come quickly . there &apos;s been an accident .
your mom &apos;s been hurt .
what happened ? where is she ?
come with me .
hello ?
who &apos;s there ?
chase ... chase ... chase ...
chase !
come on .
come on .
did you see it ?
in the darkness , the light .
did you see ?
mom ?
don &apos;t look at him . look at me .
what did you see ?
jeepers , the more i dig , the more peculiar it gets .
ok , the first victim , jake shepherd ,
had an interesting life , and i &apos;m using interesting
in replace of the phrase , &quot; he was a big hoodlum . &quot;
he had a history of truancy , petty theft , domestic disturbances ,
all of which landed him in the juvenile hall
for some stints during high school , as you can imagine .
was there trouble at home ?
not at all .
jake just fell in with the wrong crowd .
what kind of crowd ?
the drug and sexy parties kind .
but all of that changed
after his accident 6 months ago .
after he ... died .
he didn &apos;t just die .
he was saved .
jake shepherd saw the light , like literally .
he spoke of a gentle light
and a silhouetted figure bathed in warmth who welcomed him
but told him it wasn &apos;t his time .
he woke up a changed man .
he believed .
if this unsub is so obsessed with death ,
then jake shepherd was the perfect person to talk to .
he &apos;d been there and back again .
but come on , guys . gentle lights , shadowy figures ?
those are the lights in the emergency room
and the doctors hovering over the patients . we all know that .
no one actually sees the afterlife .
i did .
before tobias hankel resuscitated me ,
i had that exact experience .
and i wasn &apos;t in an emergency room .
i was in a shed .
reid , you never told me that .
i &apos;m a man of science . i didn &apos;t know how to deal with it .
there &apos;s no quantifiable proof that god exists ,
and yet , in that moment
i was faced with something that i couldn &apos;t explain .
i still can &apos;t .
what if this unsub has had a similar experience
and this is his way of looking for answers ?
if that &apos;s the case , why kill jake shepherd ?
why not just talk to him ?
he wanted to see if he had the same experience as before .
once isn &apos;t enough ?
not if jake didn &apos;t see the same thing the unsub did .
he wants to know if the experience can change .
i can relate to that .
but ... reid felt a warmth and saw a light .
when i coded in the ambulance ,
all i felt was cold and darkness .
and i would like to think
that there &apos;s a different future waiting for me .
you actually died ?
all right , but resuscitation is hit or miss .
he can &apos;t guarantee that he can actually bring anyone back ,
let alone that anyone will remember what happened
in their moment so @-@ called death .
reid , what &apos;s the best way to make sure
his victims had an experience ?
keep them dead longer .
i think your mom needs a break .
let &apos;s see how you do .
all right , thanks .
an suv &apos;s just been found abandoned
near ridge canyon lake . the car belongs to a samantha braun .
park log shows that she was there with her son evan .
let &apos;s go .
he needs a spot on the lake where he can control them .
somewhere isolated that gives him the time he needs
for his resuscitation ritual .
how would he keep them dead longer , reid ?
there &apos;s a saying in the medical community
that you &apos;re not dead until you &apos;re warm and dead .
colder water temperatures could lead to hypothermia ,
which would offer the best chance for successful reanimation .
conferencing garcia .
give it to me , baby .
garcia , our unsub &apos;s got two more victims
and he &apos;s most likely taking
them to the coldest part of ridge canyon lake .
we need to intercept him . what have you got ?
ok , checking water temperatures .
now we have several cold spots .
what &apos;s with the pinging , penelope ?
the colder spots just
matched the most recent victims &apos; diatom levels .
the unsub &apos;s been getting colder and colder the whole time .
cross @-@ reference water temperatures
with your list of prior deaths in the area .
this lake means something to him other than cold water .
if he died once before ,
there should be a report about it or another trauma
that keeps him rooted here .
we both thought that he could be a first responder
or knows the area well ,
so cross with your list of local law enforcement
and park officials .
oh , god .
daniel whitaker was murdered 15 years ago .
he was a park attendant .
his dock was in the coldest part of ridge canyon lake .
who killed him , garcia ?
his son , chase .
daniel physically assaulted his son
and then buried him alive when he was 16 .
there was no mom in the picture . chase got off light .
he got out at 18 .
garcia , check his medical history .
chase was diagnosed with lymphoma when he was 10 .
it went into remission when he was 12 , but a few months ago
he was diagnosed with
stage 4 and he &apos;s been given 3 months to live .
the idea of having to face death again
must be what sent him over the edge .
the guy &apos;s been haunted his
whole life by whatever he experienced that night .
send us the address , garcia .
come and get me , you son of a bitch !
help !
on the dock !
i need a medic !
help !
help !
let go of me !
chase whitaker ! fbi !
stay back .
let him go .
i can &apos;t .
you hurt him , you won &apos;t be alive long enough
to know what he has to say .
i need answers .
there are no answers , chase .
nobody gets to know what happens when we die .
that &apos;s why people have faith .
faith in what ? my life has been one nightmare after another .
what happened to you as a boy wasn &apos;t fair .
but neither is this .
let him go .
chase ...
chase ... chase ... chase ...
chase ... chase ... chase ...
hello , dad .
it &apos;s not your time , chase .
it &apos;s not your time , chase .
it &apos;s not your time , chase .
you &apos;re under arrest .
no .
no .
mom ?
&quot; the timing of death , like the ending of a story ,
gives a changed meaning to what preceded it . &quot;
mary catherine bateson .
you look like hell .
you want to talk about it ?
not really .
you can &apos;t save everyone , david .
you know that .
i lost you once .
i don &apos;t want to lose you again .
you have to let me go .
i can &apos;t .
life is worth fighting for .
fight how ?
fighting for what ?
for what ?
look at me .
pretty soon i &apos;m not even gonna be able to walk .
i want to go out as i am ,
as i &apos;ve lived , not who i &apos;m going to become .
i can &apos;t help you .
what you &apos;re asking ,
i can &apos;t .
i know .
i knew you never could .
you spout all that profiling talk ,
but , really , the best way to get to know someone
is to marry them .
you are the best man
i &apos;ve ever known .
that &apos;s why i wanted you to be with me tonight .
what have you done ?
just come sit .
it won &apos;t be long now .
no . don &apos;t .
they won &apos;t get here in time . please .
i have to try .
no , don &apos;t !
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t let me die in a hospital .
david ...
please .
it &apos;s fast . it &apos;s fast .
i &apos;m already tired .
do you th--
do you think he &apos;ll be there ?
i know he will .
