Back in the '80s,
I saw the movie "princess bride" 237 times.
Not just because it was Andre the giant's greatest performance,
it had magic, adventure, romance,
rodents of unusual size,
and the greatest one-liners of all time.
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
It wasn't enough to just watch "the princess bride."
I had to experience it.
Then why are you smiling?
Then why are you smiling?
'Cause I know something you don't know.
Because I know something you don't know.
I am not left-handed.
There's something I ought to tell you.
I'm not left-handed, either.
Screw wrapping paper.
We need some real swords, dude.
Can't you ask your mom? She never says no to you.
Sure, Dave Kim.
Let me ask my safety-crazed mother for a deadly weapon.
Get your head in the game, dude.
Maybe you could ask your dad.
Please. He hates movies.
All he cares about are sports and bread products.
Wait.
That's it.
Yes. Good.
Fill your mouth with that delicious buttered bagel I made you.
While I'm here, I wanted to ask for a little favor.
No.
Imagine a world
where you can live out your dream of having an athletic son
instead of a triple-threat theater force. No.
Well, that world can be yours for just $250.
No.
'cause with your help...
No - ....I can become --
You're gonna love this -- - No!
An olympic-class fencer.
Seriously?
Of all sports, you pick the one with a pointy sword?
You know how your mom's crazy about eye safety. Crazy!
Please. Fencing is my dream.
I thought your dream was to be cast as an Ewok.
I'm too big now. Things change.
Just give me what I want.
Pops, the voice of reason.
Help me out here, will you?
Come on, Murray.
Don't be such a grump and let the kid do it already.
You just walked in. You don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, I know the first thing you always say is no.
Is that what happened here? He said no?
The moron wants to fence.
I'll spend a fortune on equipment,
and he'll quit after the first match.
You know, this reminds me of a little story.
Please don't tell me a story.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
When Bevy was a girl,
all she wanted was to be a ballerina.
Sadly, she was a very early bloomer.
The other little girls would keep a wide berth around her
so if she lost her balance,
they wouldn't be crushed beneath her enormous girl body.
Point is, watching her dance
is one of the happiest memories of my life.
Don't you want to have that with your son?
Why do you always have to tell such wonderful and touching crap?
Fine.
If this is really your dream, I'll buy you the sword.
Yes!
I'm gonna be like Luke Skywalker.
Scratch that. I'm gonna be like...
Name an athlete who's really good at sports.
Michael Jordan.
Michael Jordan!
Just poked my eye.
Oh. It's okay.
I got glasses. They protected me.
It was April 22, 1980-something.
A typical day for my mom --
Power walking and being a yenta.
You won't believe what I heard about Gabe and Melinda Finkleman.
Trial separation.
What?! Is he moving out?
No, he's moving into the room above their garage
like Fonzie, only this time it's not cool.
A yenta is a nickname for the world's most intrusive,
loose-lipped gossip monger.
They're the busiest of busybodies
who have a talent for making your business their business.
Don't look.
Ginny.
It's Linda Holman.
Her son Brian is going to Cornell,
but the twin, Craig, is spending the year traveling abroad
so he can "find himself."
Translation -- he's got a problem with reefer.
Oh. So sad.
A good yenta can dish anytime, anywhere.
Yeah, it's amazing how Marsha's surgery for sleep apnea
left her so top-heavy.
You know what I mean?
Please!
I need to talk to someone from the outside world.
But most importantly, a yenta is an expert matchmaker.
Miss Cinoman! Miss Cinoman, allow me.
Why, thank you, coach Mellor.
Please. Call me coach Rick.
Well, look at those two.
They seem to be getting along nicely.
Don't even think about it.
Think about what now?
You cannot set up Mellor and miss Cinoman, understand?
That's a guaranteed disaster for us.
Disaster!
How can bringing together two like-minded, single adults
over chablis and assorted cheeses
possibly turn into a disaster for you?
Coach is my coach, and whenever he feels feelings,
he makes us run laps until we feel them, too.
And miss Cinoman is my music teacher.
Spring fling is next week, and I have a solo.
Don't be you and ruin this.
Go!
Put your foot on the gas and push.
Well, this is very hurtful.
As much as my mom wanted to do right by Erica and Barry,
there was no way she could curb her meddling
when the perfect match was just around the corner.
Coach Mellor! Hey, it's Beverly Goldberg!
Meanwhile, all I had to do was throw one match,
and this fencing sword would become my awesome movie prop.
Go get 'em, pal. No worries.
Just do your best out there.
Listen, I'm kind of running a grift on my old man,
so what do you say we give him a good show
and I'll be on my merry way?
Is your dad like a bad dude or something?
Is there always this much talking before these things?
Let's just do this, bro.
Okay, so maybe it was wrong to screw over my dad,
but I wanted to be Inigo Montoya,
and this was the least painful way.
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, god! Why?!
Or so I thought.
Cut it off of me! Cut the glove off of me!
Intermission. I call intermission.
While my dad's hope for a connection with me
took a big hit,
my mom was hoping for a love connection.
Beverly, thank you so much for your generous donation
of unique sweaters for the holiday concert.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
Oh, well, I wonder who that could be
at this late and sexy hour, huh?
How you doing, Mrs. G?
I'm here for that large donation of sports balls.
Of course. Come on in.
Uh, did you, uh, jog here?
You seem overheated.
If you ain't running, you ain't living.
Susan.
Coach Rick.
Do you two know each other?
Are you kidding me?
Work at William Penn Academy and not know Susan Cinoman
is like looking at a spice rack
and not knowing actual cinnamon.
Rick is well-regarded at school
for both his mind and his body.
I can't believe I just said that.
Ah, please.
That's why I eat six pounds of fish every single day.
Feeds both.
Well, speaking of eating, uh, would you like to just sit back
and enjoy this open bottle of wine and beautiful cheese plate?
Sure.
Rick, perhaps you'd like to ask Susan something
about herself, like, um...
Oh, did you know she used to live in Florida?
I do have many questions for Susan.
Are you from Florida?
Tampa.
I have a sports background, too.
I grew up racing greyhound dogs.
You must be incredibly fast.
I can tell by the size of your calves
you got a lot of explosion.
Oh, no.
I raced them against other dogs.
Oh. Okay.
But no one's ever said that about my calves before.
Yeah, well, I'm saying it right now.
There it was.
Another perfect match made by a world-class yenta,
much to the dismay of the yenta's children.
I'm sorry, dad.
I just had to bow out gracefully.
I wouldn't call that bowing out gracefully.
You made the referee carry you to the car.
She was a strong lady.
She was a strong lady.
But the good news is, is I learned a lot today --
Mostly, swords hurt when they jab your body,
which is why I've decided to retire from the game.
In time, I know we'll both be glad I gave this a shot.
I have to admit
that your story about Bevy dancing gave me hope.
For a second, I thought that me and Adam
actually found something that we both enjoyed.
You know, this reminds me of a story.
Oh, dear god.
I'll work through it on my own.
Yep.
I brilliantly played my dad to get a sword.
Even little bald Vizzini
would've called my plan inconceivable!
Dude! These swords are badass.
How'd you get them?
Simple.
I used my dad's love of sports
and the awkwardness of our relationship to get what I wanted.
Wow. Behind the mask and glasses lies a devious mind.
All right, Adam and boy whose name I can't remember.
Give me the swords.
Wait, what? Why?
You quit, so I'm returning them.
But they're used.
I spoke to the manager at Herman's sports.
He's a total hard-ass. He won't take them back.
It's store policy, ironclad.
No, I got some divorced dad at school
who wants to buy them to earn back his son's love,
so hand them over.
But I need them.
I mean... I have some big news.
You see, I found an even better use
for expensive sporting equipment.
Imagination.
Oh, I see what's going on here.
You played me.
What?!
You played me.
Don't insult me like that.
You used my love of sports
and the awkwardness of our relationship
to get what you wanted.
Well, I wouldn't use those words exactly.
You literally did a minute ago.
Shut up, Dave Kim!
My name is Dave Kim, by the way.
While I had let my dad down,
my mom was celebrating the perfect setup.
I did it, Ginny.
They stayed past 11:00 and she drove him home,
partly because he jogged to our house,
but partly because they wanted private time.
Wow. How do you do it, Bev?
Well, I just know that opposites attract.
I mean, she's creative and artistic,
and he likes to wear short shorts in the winter.
Wow. Well, you are just a matchmaking wizard.
I know.
But you can't tell anyone.
I would never.
This is so juicy.
I know. But you cannot tell a soul.
I would never.
The only problem was that my mom was just a single part
of an intricate web of gossiping moms.
Long before the internet, there was the world wide yenta-net.
It was faster than Erica and Barry could've ever imagined.
Yo!
Dude! Did you hear?
Miss Cinoman and Mellor are doing the wild thing.
I heard they hooked up in the pool and now they have to drain it.
Oh, god, no. Where'd you hear that?
Everyone's talking about it.
Apparently they got busy in the band room
and now they got to throw away all the oboes.
Oh, this is bad.
Your dopey friends have the biggest mouths in school.
No, no, no, they're cool.
I promise you it's not as bad as we think.
Everybody stop your gossiping!
Nobody wants to hear about Susan Cinoman
mashing parts with that neanderthal.
Get to class.
Yeah, it's bad.
It's come to my attention
that there's been some... Inappropriate behavior
with members of our faculty.
I am offended to my very core
that my integrity would be questioned.
We kissed!
Coach Rick.
It absolutely happened.
Big time.
I actually have a question.
Why am I here?
You are here because you caused this kerfuffle.
Now, I don't want to mention any names,
but there is another faculty member that has complained,
and our school's bylaws state teachers can't fraternize.
Love don't care about bylaws.
That is beautiful, coach.
What...he just said doesn't mean anything.
Ok, one of the two of you
is going to have to take a leave of absence.
If someone must go, then let it be me.
I will be the one who goes gently into that good night.
Hooray, it's settled. So, Cinoman's out, Mellor's in.
Silver lining.
Now we can go make out in the supply closet
without fear of punishment.
No. Still not okay.
Being an all-knowing yenta, my mom knew exactly
who complained about her matchmaking.
It was this man.
The lonely and bitter Mr. Woodburn.
The only solution -- find a match for him, too.
59 cents worth of noodles down the drain.
If anybody could get it done, it was Beverly Goldberg.
Can't be done.
While my mother was determined to open Mr. Woodburn's heart,
I was determined to open my dad's eyes
to "the princess bride."
Look, I know I manipulated you
into spending hundreds of your hard-earned dollars
on swords to re-create an epic movie scene,
and for that, I'd like to say my mistake.
Oh! Well, as long as it's your mistake, all is forgiven.
I can sense your sarcasm,
but I think once you see that movie,
you'll be so freaking delighted
that you'll have no choice but to forgive me.
I'm not watching that damn movie.
Do you like romance, pirates,
wizards, Mandy Patinkin?
That's a hard no to all those things.
But what I do like is my money well spent,
and that's why I'm gonna force you to fence.
But I'll get poked again, and it stings a little!
Pops, you're the voice of reason.
Help me out here.
Not after the way you manipulated your father, kiddo.
That was a real putz move.
Look, I can't fence.
I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.
Lucky for you,
I got a way you can learn everything about everything.
The encyclopedia? That's your brilliant answer?
Yes. "f" for fencing.
Now learn, damn it.
Yep, back before google and wikipedia,
the only way to look stuff up
was a set of really boring books that covered a lot,
but said a little.
There, fencing. You're welcome.
There's just a small paragraph.
I'll learn nothing from this.
"Z" for Zorro. He was a great fence man.
Oh, please, Zorro sucks.
Don't you dare knock Zorro! He is a man of honor.
Then why is he wearing that stupid mask?
What's he hiding?
All I'm saying is
Zorro had enough skill to sign a "z" wherever he went.
A "z"!
Even I can sign a "z."
Oh, I'd like to see that.
Gladly.
What'd you do that for?!
Don't just stand there!
We're in "f." Find "first aid."
Oh, you moron!
While my dad was feeling the pain of my blade,
miss Cinoman was gone,
and to coach, that was as stab in the heart.
Hustle up, Goldberg! Pick up the pace!
Coach, are you crying?
You only get one cry in life, son, and this ain't it.
Now run till your heart explodes,
'Cause...mine just did.
As coach Mellor was barely holding it together,
the school choir had completely fallen apart
without miss Cinoman.
Now...I know you're all wondering what qualifications
does your principal have to teach you music?
Well, rest assured, I was a baritone
in my high-school barbershop quartet, the dapper dougs.
Isn't your name earl?
Yes, but we had a doug and he was very assertive.
Sorry.
Now, match my pitch.
* I don't hear any singing *
* Let's go-o-o-o *
No, you're down here.
* I'm up here *
* You're down here *
* You're a girl I'm a bo-o-y *
* You're a principal *
* What makes you qualified to teach music? *
No offense
No offense taken
* But I would be very careful about that attitude *
* It leads you down to a very dangerous path *
Your yenta-ing has ruined our lives.
Coach Mellor cancelled our next wrestling match.
He said without love, what's the point of sports?
I lost my solo.
Even worse, I'm the bass in a barbershop quartet.
Principal Ball chose me over Matt Ramer,
and he's a dude, a big dude.
Okay.
I admit I may have over-yenta'd, and for that, I'm sorry.
But lucky for you,
your mama's already in the kitchen cooking up a plan.
She had a plan, all right.
Okay, what have we got, people?
And that plan was to find love for my jealous science teacher.
Leads for Woodburn. Talk to me.
We're thinking Edna Bishop.
Engaged. Next.
Betty Garellick.
Engaged. Next.
Ruth Applebaum!
Moved to jersey. Come on.
I think I might know someone.
Who?
Her name is Gail Kaufman.
She works with me at Gimbels.
She's super clumsy and dresses in primary brown
and always talks about her pet lizard.
But more than anything, I just get the feeling
they would really like each other, you know?
I do know.
Oh, and she doesn't have a ring.
How do I even know that?
Because all yentas know.
Oh, my god. You're one of them!
Oh, don't you dare say that.
But it's true.
Oh, schmoopie, I'm so proud of you!
Don't be proud. 'cause I'm not a yenta.
Don't be ashamed. It's a gift.
How's your throat skin?
You, uh, stabbed it with a sword, so it feels like that.
Here, you can sell this.
I'm sorry I lied and stuff.
It's fine. This whole thing was a mess.
I guess I was just excited about the overlap.
The what?
The overlap.
You know, you like dumb movies, I like awesome sports,
and this fencing thing was finally something
we could both enjoy...
At least I thought it was.
He was right.
This was no longer about some silly sword.
It was about sharing something with my dad,
and I had to fix it.
Dad?
Yeah.
Maybe I could give it one more try.
Honestly, you don't have to.
I do.
And you know what? I might even surprise you.
And so, I set out to become like every brave warrior
who ever wielded a sword.
The time had come to be a real hero,
not just play one from a movie.
Sadly, fighting for real was way harder
than the stage combat class I took at theater camp.
You won, gosh dang it!
It was 4-0, and if I was gonna win this match,
I'd need more than an encyclopedia.
I needed a miracle.
Thank god.
Pops, just the man I wanted to see.
Tell me what to do.
Hey, look, you got a nickel in your face mask.
Not the nickel trick now!
I got stabbed in the face.
I need advice -- real life-saving advice.
Adam, let's just go home.
You'll do your "princess bride" thing.
Of course. That was my answer --
The very movie that brought me here in the first place.
Just like Inigo Montoya,
I'd rise up and fight in the name of my father!
"The princess bride."
That's it.
Back for more?
Hello. My name is inigo montoya.
You killed my father. Prepare to die.
What now?
Hello. My name is inigo montoya.
You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Dude, what is your deal?
Hello. My name is inigo montoya.
You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Your father is right there.
He sold us our sectional.
Attaboy, kiddo!
My son's gonna be in the olympics!
In the olympics!
I wasn't,
but I was still a champion to my dad.
* Each morning I get up I die a little *
* Can barely stand on my feet *
* Take a look at yourself *
And even though Erica refused to admit she was a yenta...
she got her solo back thanks to the matchmaking skills
she learned from my mom.
Erica, thank you for telling me about the big sale...
on brown pants and shirts.
Of course.
Could I get my co-worker to help you? I'm kind of slammed today.
Gail, would you mind helping my friend here find some slacks?
Hi.
I bet you'd be interested to know
Gail here has a giant lizard.
Emerald tree or spiny-tailed?
I'll tell you all about it while you try on some corduroys.
Okay.
Okay.
This way.
Schmoopie.
Oh, no.
No proud hugs.
I'm not a yenta.
Not even a little yenta?
Do you want to hide in a dressing room
so we can hear what they're talking about?
We'll stop by housewares
and get a glass to press against the wall.
Move, move, move.
Once Mr. Woodburn had conveniently
met his perfect match,
he didn't care so much about miss Cinoman and coach Rick.
And that's the power of the yenta.
Despite the gossip and meddling...
...all they really want is to find each single person
somebody to love.
Coach, are you crying?
You only get one cry in life, son, and this is it.
Can we stop running now?
* Till the tears run down from my eyes, lord *
Even though I grew up in a small town...
we still had our fair share of adventure and romance.
And while my dad wasn't much for either...
We still managed to find our overlap.
'cause that's the thing about family.
Sometimes they demand a lot, but you love them so much...
...you can't help but give in and say, "as you wish."
Dad, what are you...
I, uh, watched the movie, and it's not bad.
Okay, let's, uh, get this over with.
Okay. So, come over here.
Stand right there and try and look enormous.
There we go.
Helen Schur says her son is working on wall street.
I just saw him bagging groceries at walmart.
I need the phone!
You've literally been on it for seven hours!
I'm telling you, Dottie Anderson's leg
100% wood.
4 carats my ass, Linda Schwartz.
We all know she's sporting a cubic Z.
They don't own that house.
They're renters.
You said that. You said that.
