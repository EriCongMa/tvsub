第六季 第八集
if you had asked me six years ago what i would be doing now ,
it would not be running for state &apos;s attorney .
州检察官候选人
let me see a show of hands .
if the election for state &apos;s attorney were held today ,
how many of you would vote for alicia florrick ?
that &apos;s seven for and , i imagine , five against .
i &apos;m not really against her . i just need to hear more .
i &apos;m just voting for her here because i like her ,
but i don &apos;t know much about her .
well , let &apos;s explore that , rita . what is it you like about her ?
i guess how she handled her marriage .
she stood by her husband .
see , that &apos;s what i don &apos;t like about her .
why didn &apos;t she divorce him ?
he slept with all of those prostitutes , and she just grins .
that &apos;s what you do , through sickness and health .
what i don &apos;t get is what this has to do with her being a state &apos;s attorney .
it matters if she &apos;s a doormat .
it matters if she has ...
okay , all right . i want to turn , uh ,
to another subject , if i may .
frank prady . what do people think of him ?
who &apos;s that ?
oh , yeah , him-- the guy on the news . he &apos;s good .
is he running ?
he hasn &apos;t make his announcement yet ,
but the expectation is that he &apos;ll run .
i like him .
he &apos;s smart and funny .
so let me ask the same question . if the elections were held today ,
how many of you would vote for frank prady ?
eight . so , someone switched sides .
was it you , reggie ?
alicia , where are you ? we need to discuss this .
i have to do some work , eli .
i &apos;ll meet you when i &apos;m done .
owen , what a surprise . eli , i will call you back .
your receptionist said i could wait in here .
no , i &apos;m thrilled . stand up .
give me a hug .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . how &apos;s your campaign ?
look , owen , i &apos;m sorry .
i should not have questioned your relationship with phil .
i won &apos;t do it again . i apologize .
thank you .
he &apos;s a good guy .
i bet he is .
and i &apos;m not gonna hurt your campaign .
i know .
so , how &apos;s school ?
it &apos;s good .
i have a case for you .
what do you mean ?
one of my students-- she was raped .
she is going in front of the university judiciary committee today
to try and get the guy expelled .
she didn &apos;t go to the police
because she doesn &apos;t want to overturn her life .
she just wants him out of her classes .
okay .
oh , that sounds like a get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ my @-@ office okay .
no , no .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m taking a step back from my cases .
it just a few hours , sis .
she just needs an advocate to sit with her
during the committee , that &apos;s all .
doesn &apos;t she know any other lawyers ?
not anybody that can be there in an hour .
an hour from now ?
it &apos;s just a couple of hours total ,
and having you there ,
the governor &apos;s wife , would really matter .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re putting on the puppy dog face .
no , i wasn &apos;t .
i @-@ i was ... i was just ... sitting waiting for your answer .
see ? it &apos;s just me ,
waiting .
so you don &apos;t have to show them anything ?
no , no , you just identify yourself .
if you &apos;re not driving a car , you don &apos;t need all that .
what about the skag ?
they can &apos;t search you ?
well , how much are we talking about here ?
um , one and a half kilos .
whoa ! someone &apos;s having a big party .
damn , man !
what do you got ? wow .
okay , no . look , they have to have cause to search your car .
it sounds bad because
you don &apos;t hear the beginning and the end of the tape .
and this is in the discovery ?
yes . they just sent it over .
and we have two weeks before trial .
well , maybe the judge won &apos;t let it in .
it &apos;s hearsay without trey .
no , forfeiture by wrongdoing .
trey was killed in an attempt to bury evidence . therefore ,
it will be admitted in .
what about the third voice ?
there are three people on that wire .
two of them are dead . there &apos;s still one .
kalinda , any luck in finding him ? dante ?
not yet . he fled after the other two were killed .
oh , alicia , do you have a minute ?
we &apos;ll be right back , cary .
god , it &apos;s hard to be the defendant .
don &apos;t ever do it .
i &apos;ll try not to .
where are you , kalinda ? you &apos;re whispering .
home .
listen , will you tell me when you &apos;re heading out
so i can come back into work ?
god , this is insane .
i know .
you know ... there &apos;s one thing that they got wrong about the wire .
what ?
there weren &apos;t three people on it , cary .
there were four .
if this were any other client ,
we would be advising him to take a plea .
but it &apos;s not any other client .
we might be doing him a disservice
by not advising him to take a plea .
you &apos;re wrong .
there weren &apos;t just three of bishop &apos;s crew on that wire .
i was there , too .
i need to testify .
no . cary , that is not a good idea .
i am the only one who can deny
that that tape reflects the full conversation .
yes , and no one will believe you .
attorneys always make the worst witnesses , cary . you know that .
i know i have no other option .
i don &apos;t want to testify . i need to testify .
we need to mock this .
hire someone to cross @-@ examine cary ,
see if he holds up .
what , are you ... ? alicia .
i thought you weren &apos;t taking any more cases .
i &apos;m not .
i just need to hand @-@ hold this girl for an hour ,
and i &apos;ll be right in .
alicia , this is so irresponsible . what is the case ?
rape .
oh , great , because rape is never controversial .
would it change your mind to know that alicia florrick &apos;s
law partner is being prosecuted by the state &apos;s attorney ?
what is he being prosecuted for ?
for telling drug dealers how to avoid arrest for the sale
and distribution of $ 1.3 million in heroin .
i like that you can &apos;t go into work .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m keeping you hostage .
hello ?
i know you &apos;re not alone , so make yourself alone .
okay .
what &apos;s wrong ?
everything all right , mr. bishop ?
my understanding is the feds are now investigating me .
they &apos;re using the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s investigation
to fuel their investigation .
how do you know that ?
the point isn &apos;t how i heard it . the point is i heard it .
what do you know about it ?
the feds ? nothing .
this isn &apos;t just about me , kalinda .
this is about cary , too .
they &apos;re coming after me through him .
no more candy .
okay , well , let me do some research first .
fast .
kalinda ?
i have to shower .
what &apos;s so secret ?
just work .
okay .
i went to a party at the theta house .
it was supposed to start their thanksgiving food drive .
i was only going to bring canned stuff .
sorry , i &apos;m not used to talking like this .
but troy was there ,
and he said i should at least stick around for a little while .
i remembered all the red zone stuff
they told us at orientation
about how many freshman girls get , you know ,
assaulted in the first few months of school
from drinking too much .
but i was careful .
i got my own drink , i didn &apos;t put it down .
i woke up in an upstairs bedroom ... naked .
i was on the floor .
troy was on the bed , asleep .
i couldn &apos;t find my clothes .
i couldn &apos;t ...
would you like to stop , jody ?
no .
uh , when i looked down ,
he had ejaculated on me .
jody , you &apos;re lying .
that &apos;s not what happened !
this will destroy my future . you can &apos;t just lie !
excuse me , sir . you can &apos;t interrupt my client .
actually ... hello , ms. florrick .
you &apos;re here as a silent advocate .
you @-@ you can &apos;t say anything .
yes , but he &apos;s the accused .
it &apos;s not his right to interrupt her .
actually , it is his right .
according to the student handbook ,
he can participate .
it is true . he raped me .
i tried to call my parents the next day ...
it was consensual .
maybe you had too much to drink or something .
i didn &apos;t have too much to drink , and i said &quot; no . &quot;
you just didn &apos;t want to hear it .
how much did you have to drink , jody ?
two to three beers .
no , tequila .
are you used to drinking , jody ?
excuse me , panelists .
mrs. florrick , we &apos;ve already warned you .
you &apos;re a silent advocate here .
yes .
i just need a bathroom break .
how are you ?
okay .
no , not so good .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t get to introduce myself . i &apos;m alicia .
i know . your @-@ your brother said .
jody , you &apos;re doing well , but here &apos;s the thing .
i can &apos;t say anything here ,
but you can , so i need you to tell them something .
what ?
the student handbook--
it says troy can participate ,
but only with questions , not with statements .
yes .
he &apos;s making statements .
he can only do that when he &apos;s questioned .
can you say that the next time he talks ?
i &apos;ll try .
good .
one more thing .
what &apos;s your phone number ?
i didn &apos;t have tequila . i had beer .
jody , that &apos;s not true . i saw you drinking tequila .
you were downstairs in the kitchen .
excuse me .
he can &apos;t do that . he can &apos;t interject like that .
unfortunately , he can , jody .
no , he can only interject with questions ,
not statements ...
according to the handbook .
it says so on page 38 , paragraph c.
okay . troy , please limit your remarks to questions .
i &apos;d like to bring you back in a couple days to continue our talk ,
but i just wanted to get your last impressions of alicia florrick .
uh , why don &apos;t we start with you , sally ?
i don &apos;t know . she seems entitled to me ,
like the world owes her something .
and why do you say that ?
something about her .
she just seems selfish ,
like everything is about my pain , my achievements .
there &apos;s a world bigger than you , you know ...
alicia , hey . hi . you made it .
no , keep it running .
no , we &apos;ll summarize for you .
it didn &apos;t go well .
no , it went well . what @-@ what do you mean ?
i &apos;m selfish .
that &apos;s just her . stuck @-@ up bitch . everybody liked you .
yeah , the real problem &apos;s prady . his brand is just as strong .
and he &apos;s announcing this week .
truth is , he &apos;ll get a big bump
from his announcement , so , we have to step on it .
what he means is , we need an event to coincide with his announcement ,
so that he doesn &apos;t own the day .
we &apos;re spitballing ideas . peter is willing to help ,
perhaps make an announcement of his own or something .
did you tell her i started my own firm ?
what ?
that lady . did @-@ did you tell her
i started my own firm ? it wasn &apos;t handed to me .
alicia , stop it .
it is one woman in a focus group .
don &apos;t obsess .
other people nodded when she said that .
no one was nodding .
play the tape again .
no .
we &apos;re going home .
you &apos;re sleeping with a federal agent .
we followed you .
you left the apartment of deputy agent delaney .
yes .
why ?
this pre @-@ dated anything to do with cary .
or you .
that does not calm me .
agent delaney is not working on your case .
the feds are opening another front .
they &apos;re feeding information to the state &apos;s attorney ,
and the s.a. is feeding information to them .
and how do you know that ?
because i &apos;m paying attention .
this is what i need from you , kalinda .
i need you to find out what your girlfriend is working on .
if you want me to feel calm about you sleeping with a federal agent ,
find out what case she is on .
you understand ?
good .
now get out .
fantastic .
where are your chairs ?
oh , they , um ... they arrive tomorrow .
how you feeling ?
how do i feel ? i feel like
a ... newly @-@ minted lawyer
ready to represent duis and bail @-@ jumpers .
you seem happier .
i &apos;m always happy .
do i seem entitled to you ?
do i think you &apos;re entitled ?
no .
why ? do you , uh ... do you feel entitled ?
it &apos;s the focus group on my candidacy .
someone said i seem ... selfish .
do you know this person ?
no .
well , then what do you care ? come on .
well , it &apos;s a voter .
and also maybe the people who know me are being too polite .
she said i seem obsessed with my own pain ,
my own achievements .
yeah , my ex @-@ wife used to say the same about me .
really ?
you don &apos;t seem that way to me at all .
thank you .
so you want to do something about it ?
what ? being entitled ?
yeah . every wednesday ,
i go to st. paul &apos;s cathedral on ashland .
they have a soup kitchen .
go volunteer .
they always need someone .
it helps you see beyond yourself .
you do that every wednesday ?
yeah .
you &apos;re a good person .
a saint , really .
you can say it .
just go .
turn up at , uh , 6 : 30 .
well , i &apos;ll think about it .
i think i might have been wrong about alicia .
sure , she has some money ,
but she gives to those less for ...
i &apos;m hank shetty .
i work as the captain of campus police here
at polytech .
jody first came to you with her accusation ?
yeah . on monday .
i guess it was three days after it happened .
and did you notice anything about her ?
yeah , she was in control .
she said she was raped
and she wanted to bring charges against troy over there .
i asked if she wanted to have a rape exam administered .
she said no .
i was surprised by that . i asked her what had happened .
she didn &apos;t know the guy &apos;s name .
she was kind of confused about it all .
she said she had been drinking .
i think i suggested she go to the cops ,
but she insisted no .
mr. shetty ,
do you have any rape kits ?
why don &apos;t we let mr. shetty finish his statement , jody .
i thought i could ask questions at any time .
that &apos;s what it says in the handbook .
that &apos;s correct .
uh , ask your question again .
mr. shetty , do you have any rape kits in your campus facilities ?
do i ... what do you mean ?
you said you offered me a rape kit ,
so i &apos;m just wondering if you had any .
any rape kits ? no .
so why did you offer a rape kit ?
what do you mean ? i asked you
if you wanted a rape kit administered .
i know , but why , if you had no rape kits ?
well ,
you know , we ... could probably get a rape kit .
but you didn &apos;t want one .
mr. shetty ,
was jody crying when she came to you ?
or upset in any way ?
no .
even as she explained
how she was being raped , she didn &apos;t cry ?
no , and i found that strange .
i asked that this panel hear testimony
from my counselor , owen cavanaugh .
so it is your opinion that this tape ,
this recording , was selectively edited ?
yes . it plays the middle of the conversation
but not the beginning and not the end .
and you think trey ,
the man wearing the wire , did this for a reason ?
yes . he was arrested by the police .
he needed to give them someone
to lighten his sentence , so he gave &apos; em me .
thank you , cary .
i know how difficult this has been .
uh , no further questions , your honor .
you may sit . prosecution have any questions ?
i do .
hi . cary .
um , my name is viola walsh .
yes , i know . hi .
i just have a few questions for you , if you don &apos;t mind .
i don &apos;t mind . shoot .
shoot ? really ?
i won &apos;t do that .
so , you worked as an assistant state attorney
before you returned to your defense work ?
i did .
and you didn &apos;t ... okay ,
um , let me figure out a way to say this without offending you .
you didn &apos;t work for lemond bishop
at the same time as when you were an asa ?
no . and don &apos;t worry about offending me .
okay , good . that &apos;s a relief .
but you worked for bishop
prior to joining the asa &apos;s office ?
i did . well , i was on his defense team .
um , yes , one of five lawyers .
so ... you worked for bishop
before and after you were an asa ?
i did .
okay .
so we just have to account for 20 months
that you were at the asa &apos;s office .
objection . attorney is testifying .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i was just talking to myself , and ...
and i won &apos;t do that again .
that &apos;s okay . take care .
i wasn &apos;t gonna sustain it anyway .
thank you .
why did you lie to your workmate
and say that you never worked for bishop ?
i never lied .
oh , well , i have a @-@ a statement here , uh , in the discovery from asa pine
that when you took on the bishop cases ,
you said that you never worked on a bishop defense .
isn &apos;t that a lie ?
no .
it &apos;s not ? then what is it ?
she was questioning my work as a deputy ,
and i wanted to stop her challenges .
so you could take bishop &apos;s cases from her ?
no , so i could stop her challenges .
but it was a lie .
no . i mean ,
it &apos;s not a lie in the way that you mean it .
and how do i mean it ?
you &apos;re trying to suggest
that i lied in order to keep working for bishop .
okay , but you just said it was a lie . so ...
was it a lie ? i @-@ i ... i mean ,
we seem to have different interpretations of a lie .
objection . argumentative .
no , i &apos;m okay with that . sustained .
oh , i mean overruled .
thank you , your honor .
cary ,
what is your definition of a lie ?
look , all i &apos;m saying
is i didn &apos;t say it to deceive her .
i mean , i didn &apos;t say it to cover up for the fact that i was ...
go ahead , cary . take your time .
i know that you want to tell us all the truth .
look , i wasn &apos;t working for bishop , and that &apos;s the truth .
so how much did you make
at the law firm prior to the sa &apos;s office ?
$ 85,000 a year .
and how much do you make now ?
well , it changes .
i have a draw of $ 350,000,
and then there &apos;s profit participation ...
$ 350,000 .
and how much did you make as an sa ?
$ 38,000 a year .
and yet you could keep your apartment .
your $ 4,000 a month apartment .
that &apos;s more than you were making every year .
so how did you pay for that ?
savings .
really ? savings ?
i wish i could save like that .
so let &apos;s talk about the two kilos of cocaine
that you never returned to evidence .
i already went through that . i didn &apos;t return it
because it was taken .
and you realize
that this is the cocaine that allowed bishop to go free .
once the cocaine disappeared , bishop got off ...
scot @-@ free .
okay , let &apos;s call a halt to this .
um ... i think we should talk , cary .
jody was very clear about what happened .
she came to me the very next day .
was she confused ? the campus office said
she was confused about what happened .
no .
she knew who raped her .
she didn &apos;t want to go to the police ,
but she didn &apos;t want to have to face him
in school every day either .
i want you to know
the campus cop was composing his erection .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
yes . huh , that doesn &apos;t make a whole lot of sense .
that almost sounds as if it was auto @-@ corrected .
this man is her counselor .
he has reason to lie .
again , the only interjection allowed is a question .
the campus cop was completely wrong in his assertions .
i saw her the next day ,
and she knew exactly what happened .
you failed me .
you d ... you don &apos;t like me . this is unfair .
i have done nothing wrong .
no , what &apos;s unfair is you talking
and not allowing us to question you .
she was drinking too much .
all right , all right , that &apos;s enough .
that &apos;s enough .
the panel is ready to deliberate and offer its decision .
excuse me .
we still have witnesses .
mrs. florrick ,
we have already warned you about staying silent .
unfortunately , jody ,
there isn &apos;t enough evidence for an expulsion .
we want to be clear .
to say there isn &apos;t enough evidence
does not mean he is innocent , jody ...
excuse me . there has been a complete lack
of due process here ,
and you have opened yourself up to a lawsuit .
what ?
title ix requires
due process in campus allegations .
you are subject to suit for not supplying that .
are you suing us ?
is that what you &apos;re doing , jody ?
yes .
no .
i mean , it &apos;s not a lie in the way that you mean it .
oh , and how do i mean it ?
you mean that you &apos;re trying ... you &apos;re trying to suggest
that i lied in order to keep working for bishop .
mine or yours ?
we need to stop working so hard .
hello .
yeah .
hold on .
be right back .
no .
because i said no .
the same with the sa--
you use him to get to bishop .
we can &apos;t . we don &apos;t have legal cause .
wait till the tap ...
alicia florrick is bringing a lawsuit against chicago polytech
on behalf of a student for rape .
does this change anybody &apos;s vote for or against her ?
is she bringing those charges now ?
yes . i &apos;d be more likely to vote for her .
rape on campus is everywhere ...
what , so she &apos;s kind of a feminist activist now ?
why does she have to be a feminist activist
to bring charges for rape ?
he &apos;s not saying that .
is she running or is she not ?
how fitting that the men in the room
are the ones having problems .
your honor , all plaintiff wants is an emergency injunction
to change the makeup of the university panel .
is there any reason
this can &apos;t be delayed until next week ?
not as far as we &apos;re concerned , your honor .
excuse me , your honor .
uh ... sorry .
your honor , uh ...
it &apos;s all right , i have to get used to ...
doing this for myself . uh , your honor ,
i &apos;m louis canning , outside counsel for the university .
mr. canning , yes . are you all right ?
uh , i am . uh ...
i just had an unfortunate bout of kidney failure
from my tardive dyskinesia medication .
my goodness . i &apos;m sorry .
unfortunately , your honor ... hello , mrs. florrick .
mr. canning .
unfortunately , your honor ,
uh , defense has to request that this case be expedited .
your honor , chicago polytechnic does not want
the negative publicity to impact their admissions process .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re asking this case be expedited .
i wish that were the case , your honor .
unfortunately , i have my operation in a week &apos;s time
and i just want to ...
make sure this is handled .
mr. canning , are you all right ?
yes , just , uh , uh ...
dys @-@ dyspnea from my , uh ,
kidney failure . i @-@ i know this is an inconvenience
to plaintiff &apos;s attorney , and @-@ and i am sorry .
i also wish it didn &apos;t inconvenience the court .
oh , stop it , mr. canning , it &apos;s ...
no inconvenience at all .
we &apos;ll start hearing testimony on your motion to dismiss tomorrow .
was any of that true in there ?
i &apos;ve missed you , alicia .
you &apos;re fun .
are you dying ?
well , everybody &apos;s dying .
are you dying now ?
no , i &apos;m having a kidney transplant .
that &apos;s it .
see you tomorrow .
he &apos;s going in for a kidney transplant ,
and she thinks he &apos;s lying .
she &apos;s not just selfish , she &apos;s paranoi ...
wow , look at you .
best @-@ dressed in the soup kitchen .
i just came from court .
you dress down well .
oh , yeah , you know , i have a consultant .
so ... the last one who shows
gets the pots .
oh , this is just like home .
but less entitled .
much less .
i can feel the selfishness melting away .
hi , eli .
we just found out from the confetti brothers
where prady is announcing .
uh , eli , i &apos;m busy .
can i try to figure out what you &apos;re saying another time ?
the confetti brothers are a duo out of wisconsin
who control all the confetti for political functions .
they told us prady is announcing at bonaventure tomorrow night .
okay , those words made sense . can i go now ?
what are you doing ?
scrubbing a pot .
yes , i can see why you have to go .
we have a plan for peter to meet you in a bonaventure hotel suite
and for photographers to see you coming out .
you can &apos;t be serious .
yeah , peter &apos;s already on board .
that &apos;ll become the story ,
not prady &apos;s announcement .
okay . i &apos;m going now , eli . bye .
better look at this .
hello .
were you at the st. paul &apos;s cathedral last night ?
yeah , why ?
there is a photo of you scrubbing an already @-@ clean pot
and talking on the phone .
oh , my god . who took it ?
i don &apos;t know . a tracker .
why were you scrubbing an already @-@ clean pot ?
it wasn &apos;t clean .
i cleaned it .
does it say it was clean ?
it says it was clean .
and why are you dressed like you &apos;re going to a dinner party ?
i wasn &apos;t . it was after work .
and i was on the phone with you .
you called me .
alicia , this is a disaster .
you can &apos;t do photo ops like this on your own .
it wasn &apos;t a photo op . i @-@ i was just helping out .
well , you can &apos;t do that .
there are people out there trying to screw you .
oh , my god , does it say it was clean ?
you need to get in here .
we need to strategize .
no , i have to go to court .
i thought you delayed that .
no , i tried to delay it .
alicia , i take my job seriously .
you need to take it seriously , too .
oh , my god ,
they &apos;re just making this stuff up .
for a politician &apos;s wife , she &apos;s kind of phony .
it &apos;s like they &apos;re not real to her--
the homeless people .
yeah . like animals in a cage .
she just went to that soup kitchen to show off .
okay , good , i think
we &apos;ve covered that thoroughly .
let &apos;s move on to the wire .
the recording of your wrongdoing .
my alleged wrongdoing .
your alleged wrongdoing . now , the tape starts with you joking
about women , is that right ?
no , that is not how it started .
that &apos;s when the c.i. decided to turn on the wire .
are you saying that the wire was edited ?
no . i &apos;m saying the c.i.
edited it by choosing when to turn it on and off .
i talk much longer than the wire .
you did ?
because we only hear the end of your joke about beyonce .
so what did you say about beyonce
before the tape started rolling ?
how is this relevant ?
cary .
no , seriously .
how is my joking about beyonce relevant ?
wow . okay , are we taking a break from questioning ?
let me talk to cary for a second .
i &apos;m just asking a question and what i don &apos;t get
is why you &apos;re not objecting more .
i &apos;m not objecting
more because these are softballs
and if i object
it &apos;ll look like we &apos;re hiding something .
well , i disagree .
okay , that &apos;s it .
let &apos;s take a break .
we &apos;ll , uh , pay for one more session .
okay . when &apos;s his trial ?
two weeks .
all right , diane , we &apos;ve had our issues in the past .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve hired me .
but i have to tell you , he is a bad witness .
if i &apos;m on the jury ,
he &apos;s going away for 15 years .
i know . thanks .
anytime .
cary ,
whatever you have to do , whoever you have to talk to ,
get your head in the game .
you are 14 days away from spending a decade in prison .
do you understand ?
i understand that i will be fine .
you need to protect me more on the stand .
watch the tape .
kalinda , close the door . it &apos;s me .
cary .
cary , this is a mistake .
do you want to go back to jail ?
no , i don &apos;t .
then stop screwing around .
30 feet between us , cary .
30 feet .
you cannot be here .
no one saw me enter .
and how do you know that ?
castro wants you in prison .
he could have cops outside .
why do you lie to me ?
cary , take this seriously .
i am .
when i call you , you say you &apos;re home ,
but you &apos;re not .
how do you know that ?
because you &apos;re with this fed .
what are you doing ?
well , you came here to bang me , so come on , let &apos;s go .
just ...
just act like you care .
for 14 days , act like i mean something to you .
you do .
well , then show me and stop going to her .
cary , come on , that &apos;s not what this is all about .
we don &apos;t do that to each other .
i can &apos;t think about anything else .
i need to save myself , and all i do
is picture you in bed with her .
cary , we &apos;re not married .
we &apos;re not even going steady .
but you mean something to me .
yes , i know i &apos;m supposed to be a good sport ,
but i don &apos;t want to be with anyone else .
i do .
okay , well , that solves that .
thank you and go to hell .
cary , wait .
let me check that nobody &apos;s outsi ...
jody had a fair hearing .
most disciplinary sessions last
less than an hour .
really ?
and how long did jody &apos;s session last ?
five hours over two days .
my goodness . that sounds like
due process to me .
objection . counselor is testifying .
poorly , too .
do you have anything else to say , mr. canning ?
uh , no , i &apos;ll just rephrase . if i may .
um , the student judiciary committee
has a lot of regulations , right ?
yes . we have a detailed manual .
that would be this heavy thing right here , right ?
that &apos;s right . 250 pages .
uh , it lays out all the rules .
and is one of the rules that a @-@ a complaining witness like ms. milam
is entitled to a silent advocate
as long as the person doesn &apos;t interfere with the participants ?
that &apos;s correct .
did mrs. florrick interfere with the proceedings ?
objection . i am not on trial here .
one second .
can you tell us the level of training
you received to sit on this panel ?
we all attended a weekend seminar .
an entire weekend ?
objection .
sustained .
we were also provided with training videos .
and were these training videos specific to sexual assault ?
no .
were you appointed to this panel , ms. booth ?
no , i volunteered .
have you volunteered to get any additional training
pursuant to sexual assault ?
it wasn &apos;t required .
no more questions .
have you ever served on a jury ?
yes . twice .
a murder trial and an embezzlement case .
did you have any experience in either of those things ?
no .
yet you and your fellow jurors
were able to reach a verdict both times ?
yes .
thank you . i have no further questions .
ms. booth ,
at the start of both trials ,
did you receive instruction from the judge ?
yes .
and were both sides able to put up expert witnesses ?
yes .
prior to the sexual assault hearing for jody milam ,
did you get
any direction or instruction ?
no .
did you call upon any expert witnesses
to clarify any medical findings ?
no .
no further questions .
let &apos;s move on to the wire ,
the recording of your wrongdoing .
my alleged wrongdoing .
okay , your alleged wrongdoing .
now , the tape starts ...
how are you ?
not good .
i know ; i saw it .
lawyers make the worst witnesses .
how about you ?
i &apos;m marie antoinette .
good for you .
i know you &apos;re not asking for advice , but i &apos;m giving it anyway .
it &apos;s an injustice what &apos;s happening to you ,
but you &apos;re lost in the indignation and the anger .
you can &apos;t see past them , and neither will a jury
if you don &apos;t get it under control .
give the jury a chance to find the injustice themselves .
coming off you , it reads like ...
entitlement .
thank you .
you &apos;ll be great .
have you finished with your good works , mrs. florrick ?
that pot was dirty , eli .
i spent 15 minutes scrubbing ...
okay , sit down .
i just spent ten minutes giving someone else advice .
don &apos;t ever do this again .
eli , i went to the soup kitchen
because i &apos;m sick of thinking about myself .
mm @-@ hmm . then think about me .
some voters think you &apos;re entitled .
some voters don &apos;t know you yet .
you want to do some good ? we make a photo op .
that &apos;s not doing a good deed .
stop acting like this is about you becoming a better person--
it &apos;s about you appearing like you &apos;re a better person .
that &apos;s what the voters respect-- the image of it .
oh , you think this is counterintuitive ?
it is .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re bad at this and i &apos;m good .
you think reporters want something original ?
they don &apos;t . they want a pre @-@ chewed story .
they want to be forced into a roped @-@ off area
to get the best picture .
they want me to feed them a line .
let me do my job , alicia .
i &apos;m good at it .
and if you really want to be a good person ,
i &apos;ll tell you where to send the check .
are we understanding each other ?
you ready , mr. agos ?
i am . thank you .
okay . according to your testimony ,
your words on that tape were tantamount
to you just hanging with the cool kids ?
shooting the breeze , killing time ?
yes .
and you don &apos;t view your actions as criminal ?
no .
or ignorance of such severity that it might as well be criminal ?
no .
would you care to elaborate ?
no .
hi . i &apos;m heading into court . anything ?
yep . i was looking for more girls troy assaulted .
i found something much better-- more rapists .
what ?
there &apos;s a rape wall on campus .
i &apos;m not following .
when a girl gets sexually violated ,
she puts up the attacker &apos;s name on the wall .
okay . but i don &apos;t think there &apos;s enough time for a class action .
no . the university is in the process of painting over the wall .
can you get me photos ?
judge , not only is this so @-@ called &quot; rape wall &quot; inflammatory ,
it &apos;s totally irrelevant .
he &apos;s right , mrs. florrick .
these names have nothing to do with whether the university
denied your client due process .
i agree , your honor .
which is why we ask for leave to amend the complaint .
a class action against the university
for creating an unsafe environment .
mr. canning ?
one @-@ one second .
mr. bishop .
hello .
what did you find out ?
from agent delaney ?
what is she working on ?
am i in danger or not ?
you &apos;re not .
are you sure ?
what is she working on ?
white @-@ collar crime .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i need you to do something for me .
next time you see ms. delaney ,
i want you to put this in her wallet .
why ?
because i &apos;m asking .
can i ask what it is ?
no .
look , mr. bishop , i &apos;m telling you the truth .
she &apos;s not focusing on you .
then put that in her wallet , and we &apos;ll be good .
i apprised the university of the progress of these proceedings ,
and they gave me this statement .
would you like to read it ?
&quot; a random search of troy anthony &apos;s dorm room
&quot; uncovered a substantial quantity of marijuana . &quot;
are you kidding me ?
we were surprised .
he &apos;s such a good kid .
keep reading .
&quot; this , of course , is a gross violation of the code of conduct . &quot;
a random search , huh ?
yes .
it happens all the time .
&quot; pursuant to university guidelines ,
&quot; troy anthony ...
&quot; has been expelled , effective immediately . &quot;
so you see there &apos;s no reason for your ...
lawsuit against chicago polytech to proceed .
actually , there are 60 reasons--
that &apos;s how many names are on the rape wall .
you &apos;re running scared . we &apos;re just getting started .
no .
jody , this is what you wanted .
troy &apos;s ... gone from your life .
i &apos;m done .
when &apos;s your operation ?
i don &apos;t know .
haven &apos;t found a kidney .
can i do anything ?
yes .
if i die ...
are you ... going to die ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;d like for you to visit my ... wife .
she likes you , and , um ...
this thing has been hard on her .
i will .
here you go .
oh , you need some silverware .
here you are .
hi , ann .
it &apos;s good to see you again .
if you need help with your housing application later ,
i &apos;ll have time . i &apos;d be happy to help .
come on , ann , let &apos;s , uh , get you some salad .
the governor &apos;s wife spent time today
at st. paul &apos;s cathedral &apos;s food kitchen--
and she was quite a hit .
in related news , incumbent state &apos;s attorney james castro
announced today he was withdrawing from the race--
this as newsman frank prady announced he would be ...
well , thanks again , everyone ,
for your patience these last few days .
i do want to ask you one more time
about your feelings toward alicia florrick .
look , i &apos;ve been all over the place about her ,
and i &apos;m still not thrilled that she &apos;s with her husband ,
but ... i like her .
i think she seems to care .
not bad , huh ?
not bad .
now we just have to beat prady .
tell me what to do .
you &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
no .
that &apos;s good .
