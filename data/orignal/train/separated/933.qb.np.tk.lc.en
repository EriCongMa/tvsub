we are going to do everything we can to get you a kidney .
in the meantime , live your life . if there &apos;s things
you &apos;re thinking about doing , do them now .
susan &apos;s condition got worse .
you &apos;re dying , and there &apos;s not a damn thing i can do about it .
beth was rejected by her husband ...
i kicked you out of this house .
that was the end !
and abandoned by her mother .
i have no more use for you . good @-@ bye .
but bree brought hope .
has the transplant office reached you ?
am i a match ?
uh , yes .
i &apos;m here to donate a kidney .
it &apos;s the most important thing i &apos;ve ever done .
and beth made the ultimate sacrifice .
we need some help over here !
we can never know
the moment our lives are about to change forever .
we might be preparing dinner ...
coming home after a long day ...
enjoying a glass of wine ...
tending to our aches and pains .
and then ...
when we least expect it ...
the moment comes .
hello ?
susan ?
this is craig lynwood from fairview memorial .
hello ?
mr. young ,
this is dr. jenkins from fairview memorial .
we have a kidney for you .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry to tell you there &apos;s been a terrible accident .
what kind of accident ?
your wife ... shot herself .
oh , my god . oh , my god ! mike ! we have a kidney !
is she dead ?
we &apos;re keeping her on life support ,
but i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s no brain activity .
so ... how soon can we do this ?
how soon can you get here ?
i don &apos;t understand .
if there &apos;s no brain function ,
why is she on life support ?
your wife is an organ donor , and we need to--
stop .
you are not to touch her until i get there .
yes , there are moments that change our lives forever ...
but not always in the way ...
we might expect .
the women of wisteria lane
look for any excuse to celebrate--
a bottle of champagne
when you &apos;re not expecting ...
a new dress , for turning 39 ...
again ...
a triple fudge cake to reward a personal best .
so when my friends heard about susan &apos;s good fortune ,
they just couldn &apos;t resist .
surprise !
what ? what are you supposed to say when someone gets an organ ?
kidney !
how about &quot; congratulations &quot; ?
we are so thrilled for you . when is this happening ?
i guess tonight .
so will you still be at my party saturday ?
because you did r.s.v.p.
well , it depends .
can you move the party into the intensive care unit ?
so that &apos;s a no . gaby &apos;s in charge of the guest list ,
in case anybody else decides to flake at the last minute .
hello , susan .
well , i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be bringing an entourage .
well , it &apos;s a happy day on our street .
i would imagine , a bit of a sad one , too .
no , i can just call the caterers ,
say there &apos;s one less person . no big deal .
isn &apos;t that a little harsh ? i mean , she was a neighbor .
who are you talking about ?
your donor , beth young .
beth is her donor ?
wait , you--you don &apos;t know any of this ?
beth came to the e.r. with the transplant papers ,
and then ... she shot herself .
is she dead ?
she &apos;s on life support , but she &apos;s not gonna make it .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry . i @-@ i thought you knew .
her husband is with her now .
we want to give him some more time with her ,
so we &apos;re anticipating a bit of a delay .
oh , poor beth .
i just saw her yesterday .
i mean , she seemed off ,
but she always seemed a little off , so i left .
how could i not have realized she was in so much pain ?
oh , bree , you couldn &apos;t have known this would happen .
are you okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
it sounds like nothing &apos;s gonna happen tonight .
why don &apos;t you just all go home and get some sleep ?
hello ?
it &apos;s karen .
get your ass over here . i got something that belongs to you .
little hint--
it reeks of mai tais and you gave birth to it !
i come downstairs to make breakfast , and there he is ,
passed out , stewed to the gills .
again , karen , we are so sorry .
if i wanted a drunk homo on my couch ,
i would have married my college boyfriend .
you can let me go , all right ? i &apos;m okay .
okay ? you broke into a neighbor &apos;s house
and passed out .
i didn &apos;t break in . i ...
i got a little confused , and ...
went in the wrong house .
you got to admit , all these places kind of look the same .
when you &apos;re drunk ! andrew , this is not good .
calm down , all right ?
i just--i just had a little too much fun last night .
you need to be very careful .
thanks to me , you have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism .
what ? just &apos; cause you &apos;re one ,
you want everyone in your little club ?
i &apos;m not an alcoholic , okay ?
i got everything under control .
how bad is it ?
it &apos;s really bad .
when did it start ?
a while ago . first it was just on the weekends ,
then sometimes during the week ,
and now it &apos;s every night .
i wish you had told me .
you know what i &apos;ve started to do ?
i pretend i have to work late ,
so i don &apos;t have to come home and deal with him .
well , you need to talk to him .
i have ,
and he promises it &apos;ll get better ,
but it only gets worse .
i love him , but i can &apos;t take it anymore .
i know . it &apos;s very difficult .
no , bree . i &apos;m thinking of leaving him .
please don &apos;t . not yet .
let me try to get him some help . i &apos;ll talk to him .
no offense , but i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna get through to him .
don &apos;t be so sure .
i once smuggled vodka into church
in a &quot; jesus saves &quot; sports bottle .
i can be pretty resourceful .
tables and chairs go out back ,
chafing dishes and flatware in the kitchen ,
and eyes off the boobs , but thanks for noticing .
hey . i saw the party rental truck . what &apos;s going on ?
what do you think ? it &apos;s for our party tomorrow night .
wh--our spring fling ?
we &apos;re ... still flinging ?
oh , why wouldn &apos;t we be ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
unless the theme is &quot; neighbors who blow their brains out , &quot;
i kind of thought the beth young thing
might put a damper on the festivities .
why ? she wasn &apos;t even invited .
well , we can &apos;t ignore the fact
that one of our neighbors is dead .
brain @-@ dead . big difference .
besides , she seems like a clinger .
bet she &apos;ll stick around for months .
so you think it &apos;s okay that we still throw this party ?
gaby , it &apos;s not a party . it &apos;s an event .
would you cancel the oscars ? christmas ? no !
the invitations have been sent , the caterer &apos;s been hired .
life is for the living , so let &apos;s live .
well , the living did buy a new dress ...
versace .
and i &apos;m sure beth would have loved
to have seen you in that versace .
she would have , wouldn &apos;t she ?
in a--in a way ,
it could be a tribute to her .
and i did see the
perfect tribute shoes at the mall .
now that is the spirit .
now make sure the guests know the party is still on ,
and i will take care of the arrangements here .
oh , and , uh , maybe we could have a moment of silence
and then a champagne toast in beth &apos;s honor .
oh , fabulous idea ,
except instead of champagne , let &apos;s do mojitos ,
and instead of beth , let &apos;s toast to us .
and the moment of silence ?
would sound great with music .
oh . sorry .
* ... please pick up 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 8 @-@ 7 . *
* satellite pharmacy , please pick up 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 8 @-@ 7 . *
paul , i want you to know how sorry i am .
can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through right now .
i want you to know how grateful i am
for this gift that beth is giving me .
obviously , it doesn &apos;t bring her back .
but i hope it will be a small comfort to you
knowing that in some way she &apos;ll live on .
why would that give me comfort ?
are you trying to tell me
that my wife is dead and that you &apos;re the consolation prize ?
no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying--
i hate to disappoint you , susan ,
but my wife &apos;s not dead .
she &apos;s very much alive .
they told me there was no chance--
i don &apos;t care what they told you .
beth is alive , and i intend to keep her that way
as long as possible . i &apos;m not going to allow you
to strip her for parts like some abandoned car .
that &apos;s not what &apos;s happening here . this was beth &apos;s idea .
beth was not in her right mind when she signed those forms .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , they mean nothing .
and what makes you think you deserve her kidney ?
was it those meals you shared with her ?
all the girls &apos; nights you included her in ?
the little gestures of kindness you offered
to make her feel less alone ?
right .
you gave her nothing in life ,
and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re going to get in death .
i don &apos;t get this . beth signed the donation forms
and a living will . those are legal documents .
aren &apos;t they binding ?
yes and no .
you &apos;re gonna have to do a little better than &quot; yes and no . &quot;
yes , they &apos;ll stand up in court , but this hospital &apos;s not inclined
to wage a legal battle against a grieving husband .
it &apos;s too delicate .
he &apos;s not a grieving husband .
paul young has a vendetta against my family .
he &apos;s only doing this to make us suffer .
look , we can &apos;t publicly support you ,
but if you decide to take this on ,
we won &apos;t stand in your way .
you &apos;re damn right we &apos;re gonna take this on .
no , we &apos;re not .
susan--
we &apos;re not fighting paul .
this is your life we &apos;re talking about here .
we can &apos;t let him win .
win ? his wife shot herself .
and you want to , what ,
hire lawyers ? drag him to court ?
i know that you &apos;re only thinking of me ,
but this is paul &apos;s decision to make .
it &apos;s not ours .
i just want to go home .
thanks for helping me drop these off .
yeah , no problem . it &apos;s nice to be out of the house .
when did you start catering again ?
oh , it &apos;s nothing official , just when i &apos;m needed .
and who &apos;s the client ?
um ... they prefer to remain anonymous .
coffee ? doughnuts ?
the old drunk guy from outside the supermarket ?
this is an a.a. meeting .
it &apos;s a wonderful program .
lying to your son-- which step is that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
but now that you &apos;re here , why don &apos;t you give it a try ?
just listen to people &apos;s shares
and see if you relate .
and what am i supposed to say when i get up there and talk ?
&quot; hello , my name is andrew .
&quot; my mommy brought me &quot; ?
no one has to know we &apos;re related .
andrew , please .
just one meeting . it could save your life .
hey . i see you &apos;ve met bree . my name &apos;s tommy . welcome .
first time ?
yes , first time . uh , my name is ... elvis .
elvis . really ? that &apos;s your name ?
yes , it &apos;s elvis .
yet another reason for me to be mad at my mother .
hey . how &apos;d it go ?
ah , we would have played better if there was a windmill .
lynette , this is glenn morris ,
c.e.o. of morris technologies ...
he is a man who can throw a 6 @-@ iron
farther than he can hit with one .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
so you guys want to come over for a beer ?
uh , you know what ? i should go . next time .
see ya .
well , nice to meet ya .
hey , do you mind if
i use the facilities before i hit the road ?
no . come on in .
the bathroom &apos;s down there .
we have five kids .
you might want to squint .
actually , i don &apos;t need a bathroom .
i need a c.f.o.
what ?
my chief financial officer took a job in london ,
and there &apos;s one name on my list for his replacement--
tom scavo .
tom scavo-- i know that guy .
glenn , where &apos;d this come from ?
well , carlos is always bragging about you ,
so i started asking around .
come to find out everybody loves you .
what &apos;s not to love about tom scavo ?
i &apos;m prepared to give you a very generous salary ,
stock options , access to the company jet .
wow , this is amazing .
but no .
well , we just found something
not to love about tom scavo .
what ?
carlos is a close friend , and we &apos;re just starting
our busy season . i can &apos;t leave him in the lurch .
look , tom ,
i don &apos;t want to buy a man out of his loyalty--
you could try .
it &apos;s never hurts to put in an offer .
lynette ...
glenn , you have made my day ,
but i gotta pass .
this conversation isn &apos;t over . i hope you &apos;re gonna
talk some sense into this husband of yours .
talk , beat , whatever gets the job done .
okay . now is when you wink , rub your hands together ,
and tell me you were playing that man like a fiddle ,
&apos;cause this blank stare ...
that &apos;s not fading is scaring the hell out of me .
i &apos;m not gonna screw over carlos .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
whatever happened to integrity ?
nothing .
it got a better offer from glenn
and turned into prosperity .
lynette , as much as i appreciate you trying to run my life ,
this is my decision , and i &apos;m saying no .
okay . um ... it looks like we have a little time left .
anyone else want to share ?
elvis ?
it &apos;s not mandatory ,
but we &apos;d love to hear from you .
elvis ?
uh , no , thanks . i @-@ i pass .
this is a safe place . no one here is going to judge you .
okay . you know ...
when i hear you guys talk
about how other people try to control your lives ,
like , uh , ed here with his boss
or ... oh , mary ann with her ... cat ,
you know , i can relate .
you know , i have the same kind of problem
with ... my mother .
you know , i @-@ i think her greatest regret in life
is the fact that she gave birth to a son and not a puppet .
she &apos;s such a control freak
that my sister and i used to call her &quot; attila the mom . &quot;
could we not laugh ?
i mean ...
we &apos;re trying to heal here .
nothing i ever did was good enough for her .
like in the tenth grade ,
i @-@ i wanted to run for-- for class president ,
and the night before i was gonna announce , she said ,
&quot; are you sure about this ?
&quot; you &apos;re not exactly a born leader . &quot;
ouch . she sounds awful .
or does she sound like a loving mother
trying to protect her son
from disappointment ?
i don &apos;t think so ,
&apos;cause she wouldn &apos;t even listen to my speech .
well , maybe she was busy
preparing dinner for a family of four
with no help from her son .
yeah , it is hard work making dinner
while maintaining an atmosphere
of emotional repression .
well , if you ask me ,
some emotions could stand to be repressed .
uh , bree ?
i &apos;m sorry , but we &apos;re here to stop drinking ,
not criticize the women who gave us life .
he &apos;s just trying to share .
well , there is a difference between sharing and whining .
okay . uh , we are definitely out of time .
thank you , everybody .
now let &apos;s just join hands and recite the serenity prayer .
god ...
grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change ,
the courage to change the things that i can ,
and the wisdom to know the difference .
so i just wanted to remind you
about the party renee and i are throwing tomorrow night .
you &apos;re still having that thing ?
a woman &apos;s on life support .
exactly .
she &apos;s not dead . it &apos;s like you &apos;re making my argument for me .
put roy and me down for a &quot; no , &quot;
but please , call us
when you have your hurricane katrina pool party .
so ... renee and i are still having our party ...
are you nuts ? in case you haven &apos;t heard ,
our friend across the street , betty young ,
just blew her brains out .
beth young .
oh . i got her name wrong . how disrespectful .
oh , i hope you don &apos;t tell that story tomorrow at your party .
it &apos;s just a little neighborhood gathering ...
gabrielle , what is wrong with you ?
oh , boy .
i know we didn &apos;t know beth very well ,
but we did know mary alice ,
and this tragic event has brought up a lot of
painful memories for all of us .
how could you not realize that ?
well , they can all go to hell .
we &apos;re still having the party .
are you listening to me ?
i got four &quot; are you out of your minds , &quot;
three &quot; you make me want to puke , &quot;
and one &quot; maybe , &quot; from lee .
the message is pretty clear .
yeah . &quot; order less shrimp . &quot;
no . renee , we can &apos;t have this party .
we should have canceled the moment we heard about beth .
ah , nobody even liked her .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s in horrible taste . why can &apos;t we just change the date ?
no ! for ten years
i &apos;ve had my spring fling the first sunday of april ,
not the second sunday , not the third ,
and not when a bunch of wimps decide
they &apos;re ready to stop moping .
i &apos;m not canceling the party .
but nobody &apos;s gonna be here .
oh , well , we &apos;ll see about that .
my social life is not gonna come to a stop just because
some cuckoo bird decides to clean her ears with a handgun .
wow . thank you .
for what ?
making me the compassionate one .
wow . is he asleep already ?
yeah , he was exhausted .
not even harry potter could keep him awake tonight .
look , i &apos;m not trying to upset you , and i &apos;m not mad ,
but i need to know why
you won &apos;t let me fight to get you the kidney .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just , uh ...
it just feels wrong .
well , it shouldn &apos;t . beth wanted you to have it .
exactly .
she killed herself so i could have her kidney . why ?
paul &apos;s right . i never had
so much as a pleasant exchange with the woman .
i don &apos;t know that the reason matters .
what matters is , it was her final wish .
but it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i can &apos;t take her kidney , knowing that maybe
i &apos;m the reason she &apos;s lying in that hospital .
hey . hey , i &apos;m--i &apos;m reading .
oh , good evening , sir . welcome aboard .
can i get you anything before we ...
take off ?
ooh . you could help me put my bag under the seat .
okay , you &apos;re not good at this ,
so let me do the talking .
may i help you with your seat belt ?
oh , look--
you &apos;re already in the upright and locked position .
what &apos;s the name of this airline ?
i want to become a frequent flyer .
oh , this isn &apos;t a commercial airline , sir .
hotshot executives like you only fly on the corporate jet .
mmm . hey , l @-@ lynette ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not taking that job .
well , then you &apos;ll be handling your own bags from now on .
lynette , we talked about this .
i @-@ i won &apos;t leave carlos in the lurch .
okay , great . you &apos;re loyal . i love that .
but your stock went way up today .
if you &apos;re gonna stay put , at least could you try
to get something out of this ?
well , i could tell carlos about the offer ,
see if he &apos;ll match the number .
match the number ?
oh , look--
a seat just opened up .
i wondered if you would come .
they told me at the hospital that you &apos;re trying to have beth
declared dead and her life support turned off .
yes .
well , that &apos;s not going to happen .
it has to .
why ?
because she &apos;s dead .
no , she &apos;s not .
my daughter &apos;s dead .
your wife is dead .
and we both know what killed her .
if you &apos;re trying to blame me for this ...
if this is your last attempt to use her to hurt me ...
no . we don &apos;t get to use her anymore , paul .
this ... sick game you and i play ,
this hate we hurl at each other has finally found a victim--
the only innocent person in the game .
i did nothing .
you refused to believe she loved you .
i turned her away because she did .
and now she &apos;s gone .
she ...
maybe she can recover .
i believe she can . you must believe it , too ,
or you wouldn &apos;t be in here praying for her .
i &apos;m not praying for her .
i &apos;m praying for forgiveness .
we did this to her , paul .
now we have to stop .
and we have to let her rest .
hi . can i come in ?
sure .
i &apos;m on my way to a meeting
and i was hoping you might join me .
look , the deal was one meeting , mom . i went and i &apos;m done .
you won &apos;t go back ? even for me ?
nope . elvis has left the building .
look , i don &apos;t need to go , all right ? i &apos;m fine .
i hope you know that &quot; i don &apos;t have a problem &quot;
is one of the biggest cliche in out playbook .
don &apos;t get me wrong . i have plenty of problems .
i @-@ i have no job .
alex works these crazy 18 @-@ hour shifts at the hospital .
what &apos;s my day ?
long , endless stretches of nothing .
i work out . i do laundry .
i @-@ i dusted the other day--
actually dusted and felt proud .
how pathetic is that ?
i don &apos;t find that pathetic .
i know you don &apos;t .
look , the one thing that gets me through
is--is knowing that when the night rolls around ,
i can just have a few drinks and kick back .
and as long as i don &apos;t hurt anyone ,
i think i &apos;m allowed .
mom , trust me .
i &apos;ll be okay .
if you say so .
what ?
you listen to me .
there &apos;s been a terrible tragedy in our neighborhood .
a woman felt desperate and alone and killed herself
because nobody cared enough to help her .
and the thing is , i was there .
i saw that something was wrong ...
and i walked away .
and i am never gonna let myself do that again ,
and certainly not with you .
alex left me .
oh , my ...
i guess he just got sick of living with a drunk .
oh , sweetie .
what did i @-@ i do ?
i @-@ i wrecked my marriage .
look , it &apos;s gonna get better .
i promise you it &apos;s gonna get better .
but for that to start ,
you need to go to a meeting .
i can &apos;t get up in front of a bunch of strangers
and talk about this .
then ... we can have a meeting right here--
just the two of us .
what do you say ?
wow . well , that &apos;s glenn for you . he &apos;s nothing if not aggressive .
carlos , i swear i didn &apos;t seek this out .
i know you didn &apos;t . and you &apos;re a stand @-@ up guy for telling me .
but it is a very generous offer ,
and i figured if that &apos;s my value in the marketplace ,
that maybe i should be ...
doing a little better here .
look , our friendship aside ,
you are a valuable part of this company .
and if i had the cash ...
you know i &apos;d step up .
but ...
you know rough things have been .
you &apos;ve seen the empty desks .
we just can &apos;t offer you that kind of money .
but i don &apos;t want to lose you , so here &apos;s what i can offer--
title bump to chief marketing officer ,
car allowance , and ...
profit participation .
how &apos;s that sound ?
it sounds like a bunch of crap .
ugh . lynette .
of course he pleaded poverty .
did you play hardball ? did you grind him ?
yes ! that &apos;s how i got profit participation .
tom , i worked at that company , remember ?
at the end of the year , carlos takes the excess cash
as a bonus , so there is no profit to participate in .
what else did he offer you ? a bogus new title ?
not--not bogus ! chief marketing officer . c.m.o.
a @-@ and a car allowance .
oh , that &apos;s great .
&quot; here &apos;s your allowance , tommy . good luck on your paper route . &quot;
you are over the line , lynette .
and you are walking away from real money and real power
for pretend profits and a made @-@ up title .
carlos might as well call you &quot; king of all important things &quot;
and give you a pile of monopoly money .
why do you keep pushing like this ?
&apos;cause if i don &apos;t , you go nowhere .
so that &apos;s where you think i am ?
nowhere ?
oh , my god . you &apos;re not gonna take that back ?
i think you are an amazing husband and father .
but as a businessman ...
you &apos;re 46 years old
and you &apos;re still trying to establish yourself .
opportunities like this don &apos;t keep falling from the sky .
you gotta grab &apos; em .
by stabbing my friend in the back ?
do you think carlos would hesitate for a second ...
if the roles were reversed ? not a chance .
that &apos;s how he got where he is .
he &apos;s ruthless .
you wanna see me get ruthless ?
watch what happens if you don &apos;t drop this .
wow . this is some crowd .
told ya . well , i &apos;m pretty close to capacity ,
so you &apos;re gonna have to scoot along now-- well ,
i &apos;m just stunned so many people came .
well , just shows you how little you know
about the party circuit elite . oh .
wait . is that the guy from animal control
who picks up dead birds ?
what ? no .
uh , these are mostly people i &apos;ve met through the years
in the caribbean .
mrs. solis ? i was going to call you .
is it okay if i clean your pool
on thursday instead of wednesday ?
of course . i mean , if you think you &apos;ll make it back
from st . barts by then .
ugh ! don &apos;t give me that look .
a good hostess knows the best parties
have a mix of people .
honey , the only mix i see
is the cotton / poly blend on every dress in this room .
excuse me .
renee !
renee , look , i--
hey , you two !
beat it !
you have a cool house .
i don &apos;t get it . why have a party
when you people you really want are too sad to come ?
well , i &apos;m not sad , and i &apos;m not gonna pretend to be .
renee ! i know you didn &apos;t like beth , but come on . she &apos;s dying .
and whose fault is that ?
everyone keeps acting like this horrible thing happened to her .
it didn &apos;t just happen . she did it to herself .
but think about how much pain she must have been in .
everyone has pain .
but only a selfish bitch checks out
and passes it on to everyone else .
beth didn &apos;t care who she hurt--
her mother , her husband , her daughter !
she didn &apos;t have a daughter .
well , amen for that , at least .
honey , you told me your mom died when you were young .
you never said how .
did she take her own life ?
what do you think ?
damn it .
how hard is it to fill an ice bucket ?
you know , i lost a parent when i was a kid , too--my dad .
i &apos;m not making comparisons here ,
and i understand if you don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
good , &apos; cause i don &apos;t .
but i think that if you do ...
do what ?
i &apos;ll feel so much better if i let it all out ?
well , that doesn &apos;t work for me .
i &apos;m not a hug @-@ and @-@ learn kind of gal .
no , i guess you &apos;re
a throw @-@ party @-@ and @-@ forget kind of gal .
look , i will never forget what my mother did .
i think about it every day .
but i refuse to let it be what defines me .
this spring fling might seem shallow and insensitive to you ,
but it &apos;s my way of saying i choose life ...
over death .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;ve gotta get back to my lame @-@ ass party
wait .
it &apos;s not a lame @-@ ass party anymore ...
because i &apos;m here now .
0 to 60 in under 5 seconds ,
top speed of 160 , and no cup holder ...
&apos;cause you &apos;ll want both hands on the wheel .
sweet .
can i take it for a test drive ?
oh , it would be our pleasure . oh !
so is the car for you ? your husband ?
actually , no .
it &apos;s for our neighbor .
hey , sweetie .
is something wrong ?
guess who &apos;s got a brand @-@ new slap in the face
parked in front of his house ?
what are you talking about ?
carlos . the day after he cries poor to me ,
he goes out and buys himself a $ 70,000 lotus ?
i think the evora runs around $ 76,000,
but what do i know ?
you were right , lynette . i &apos;m a pushover .
i &apos;m being loyal to a guy who does nothing
but look out for himself .
wow . you must feel really betrayed .
i got half a mind to call glenn right now
and take that offer .
i say ... use your whole mind and do it .
glenn ?
tom scavo .
i am in .
yes !
yeah , yes ! i am excited , too .
well , you wanna have lunch tomorrow
and hash out the details ? i will see you then .
feels good , huh ?
feels real good .
you know what &apos;s gonna feel even better ?
telling carlos to go screw himself .
no ! wait ! wait !
don &apos;t try and stop me ! i &apos;m gonna tell that guy
just where he can stick his evora .
okay , but before you do ,
it &apos;s not carlos &apos; .
ahem . i borrowed it from the dealer
and i parked it there .
what ?
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
it sounds very bad , but i did it for a very good reason .
that you can manipulate me into
doing whatever you want ?
carlos didn &apos;t buy that car ,
but he could have
without even feeling it because ...
he &apos;s the kind of guy
who doesn &apos;t let a good opportunity get by him .
meanwhile , you &apos;re his dutiful number two ,
staring down the street at a car you wish you had .
get in . we &apos;re taking it back ,
then i &apos;m calling glenn .
just one--
get in .
tom , this could be you--
driving this car ,
living this life ,
being that guy .
i understand if you wanna say no to all that ,
but i don &apos;t even think you &apos;ve asked yourself ,
do i want it ?
it would be better if you didn &apos;t talk right now .
i can &apos;t tell if we are gonna drive ...
or fly .
what time does this have to be back ?
he said 4 : 00 , but they don &apos;t close till 6 : 00 .
i &apos;m guessing we could be a little late .
yeah . let &apos;s be a little late .
hello , susan .
would it be okay if i came in for a moment ?
uh , actually , i was ...
sure .
i &apos;ve never been to your apartment .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not much .
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s quite nice .
i &apos;m on my way to the hospital to see beth ...
to say good @-@ bye .
i &apos;ve alerted the transplant office
that we &apos;ll be moving forward with her request .
i &apos;m sure as soon as i sign the papers ,
they &apos;ll be contacting you .
i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re getting your kidney .
i thought you said--
susan ...
i would be very grateful to you if you could ...
forget a lot of the things that i said .
you were right , paul .
i was terrible to beth . i was .
i never gave her a chance .
i never tried to get to know her .
why would she do this for me
when i did nothing to deserve it ?
beth didn &apos;t love people
because they deserved it .
believe me . i know that .
i &apos;m so confused . i ...
i don &apos;t know if i can accept .
please ... honor beth &apos;s life
by allowing her to make you well ,
for your son ...
for your family ...
for your friends .
okay .
thank you .
paul ...
yes ?
i am so ...
very , very sorry about your wife .
yes .
i am , too .
there comes a moment when our lives change forever ...
the moment we admit our weaknesses ...
the moment we rise to a challenge ...
the moment we accept a sacrifice ...
or let a loved one go .
and sometimes ...
the change in our lives ...
is an answer to our prayers .
ms. tillman ?
thought i &apos;d find you here . so sorry for your loss .
thank you , warden .
i &apos;m sure this is small consolation ,
but i &apos;ve just heard from the parole board .
they &apos;ve decided to grant your request
for humanitarian release .
ironic , isn &apos;t it ?
my daughter had to die so i could go free .
