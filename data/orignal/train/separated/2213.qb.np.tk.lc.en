dates all the way back to ancient egypt .
barbers would make house calls to families and nobility .
come on .
i &apos;m serious .
they found hieroglyphics in the pyramids
showing pharaohs getting their hair cut .
okay , and you &apos;re carrying the legacy for all barbers ?
exactly .
why go out when your hair maintenance man can come to you ?
truthfully ,
the whole thing has been liberating .
not having insurance on the shop turned out to be a blessing .
i &apos;m saving a fortune on rent , electricity , water .
yeah , right , low overhead , right ?
must be good for profits .
well , actually , i &apos;m still just barely getting by . go figure .
but , uh , i &apos;m not complaining .
catching waves , cutting hair .
what else does a man need ?
you said it , pal .
all right , let &apos;s take a look .
voilà .
buddy .
thank you , it &apos;s perfect .
that &apos;s what i want to hear .
anything else i can do for you ?
yes . i didn &apos;t just call you down here for a haircut .
i need a favor .
that &apos;s my cue to say good @-@ bye .
where you going ? you haven &apos;t even heard what it is yet .
yeah . last time i did you a favor
i opened my shop early ,
i spent the rest of my day dodging bullets .
so if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to leave now
with my cash for services rendered
and , uh , a generous tip .
and i will see you again when things get unruly upstairs .
odell , if i had another choice ,
i wouldn &apos;t ask , but i don &apos;t .
my friend needs a lawyer ,
right now you &apos;re my only option .
well , as you can see ...
i &apos;m not a lawyer .
yeah , but you were a lawyer .
you passed the bar when you first moved to the island ,
which means technically you can still practice .
that was ten years ago , man .
i only took the bar because i needed a loan
to open up my shop
and my father wouldn &apos;t give me the money unless i did .
just out of curiosity ,
what &apos;s your friend being , uh , accused of ?
what is it , dui , b and e ?
murder .
i &apos;m really not interested .
he &apos;s innocent .
the public defender is ready to throw in the towel .
the guy , he wants to take a plea bargain .
well , don &apos;t take the deal . get a better lawyer .
we can &apos;t . we tried .
no one wants to touch this .
well , if everybody &apos;s saying it &apos;s a losing horse ,
then , uh , maybe you better step away from the window .
odell , this guy &apos;s a five @-@ 0 asset .
if he says he didn &apos;t do it , we believe him .
unfortunately we &apos;re part of the minority .
now , he &apos;s been in front of this judge before .
this guy has it in for him .
he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s accelerated the trial .
till when ?
this monday .
that &apos;s three days from now .
i know it &apos;s three days from now .
who the hell is this guy ?
oh , sorry , this room &apos;s taken .
you &apos;re gonna have to interrogate this haole somewhere else .
sang min , meet odell martin , your new lawyer .
seriously , mcgarrett ?
this is the best you can do ?
huh ? what happened ?
pizza delivery guy wasn &apos;t available ?
hey , big trouble in little china .
you want my help , ease up on the digs .
yeah .
you must be some lawyer .
what , are you going all out for casual friday ?
are you sure you don &apos;t want this guy locked up for life ?
&apos;cause i do .
he grows on you . i promise .
i bet he does , like a bad fungus .
and if this is gonna happen , first thing i &apos;m gonna need to do
is cut whatever that thing is growing out of his head .
you touch my hair ,
and i &apos;ll be going to jail for your murder .
this is gonna work out great .
i can feel it .
no , no .
absolutely no way am i representing that cartoon character .
good luck .
you didn &apos;t pay me for the haircut .
you know , maybe your old man was right .
hey . do me a favor , don &apos;t ever bring up my old man .
all right ?
‭ my bad , sensitive subject .
i get that .
must &apos;ve been tough on him , too , though .
putting all his hopes and dreams into his son
who would one day follow in his footsteps
and , you know , reside over the family practice ...
i know what you &apos;re doing .
is it working ?
it &apos;s annoying .
odell , i know it doesn &apos;t seem like it ,
but that man in there is innocent of this crime .
and i need you .
i &apos;m trying to free myself from the binds of responsibility
and you want to put a man &apos;s life in my hands .
but if you say no to me ,
an innocent man goes to prison .
come on .
oh , let me guess .
you couldn &apos;t find the elevator .
must be a bitch getting old .
would you shut up , please ?
he &apos;s taking the case .
well , what if i decide i don &apos;t want him ?
you go to prison for the rest of your life .
okay . he can represent me .
well , your gratitude is appreciated .
that &apos;s great .
okay , look , we only got three days to prepare ,
so we can &apos;t afford to waste any more time , hmm ?
okay , perry mason ... not .
you know , but i draw the line at cutting my hair .
you know , it took me almost a year to grow it back
after skipping out on halawa .
can i talk to you for a second ?
yeah .
you do know that a defendant who escaped from prison
is probably gonna be somebody
that a jury finds hard to trust , you know ?
‭ kind of , kind of destroys his credibility a bit .
yeah , so that &apos;s why it &apos;s really important you make sure
it doesn &apos;t get brought up while we &apos;re in court .
only way for that to happen
is keep him off the stand .
can you do me a favor and tell him that , please ?
look , i @-@ if you don &apos;t testify ,
the jury will only hear facts pertaining to this case .
as far as the court of law is concerned ,
any crime you committed in the past has no relevance .
no , no , no , no .
i have to testify .
no , you don &apos;t .
no .
yes , i do !
you don &apos;t .
no , you don &apos;t .
okay ? you get on that stand ,
they &apos;re gonna attack your character .
everything you &apos;ve ever done--
ever done--
is admissible , okay ?
and it &apos;s a long , long list .
i didn &apos;t shoot that guy ,
but there are no witnesses who can back up my story .
the jury has to hear the truth from me .
hey , it ain &apos;t my life on the line .
you want on the stand , have at it .
but don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you . okay ?
we got that cleared up ?
yeah .
let &apos;s start at the beginning .
tell me exactly what happened , step by step .
well , it started , uh ... last year .
i was lending my , uh , services to five @-@ 0 .
at that point , the human trafficking game on the island
was up for grabs .
two guys took it over .
we knew the identify of one of them , james lam ,
but the other , we did not .
that &apos;s why we took sang min out of prison again ten days ago .
lam and i go way back ,
you know , i gave him his first job collecting unpaid debts ,
so i set up a face @-@ to @-@ face .
but when i showed up ,
the guy was , uh , lying on the ground
with a bullet in his chest .
what happened next ?
oh , let &apos;s just say i was caught in a ...
... unfavorable position .
hands up !
drop your weapon !
let me get this straight .
we got no witnesses
to corroborate your account of what happened ,
and ...
we got no leads on tracking down the real killer .
no .
just the word of a man
who &apos;s spent the better part of his life
either in jail or being pursued by the cops .
yeah .
yeah .
piece of cake , right ?
this place is money .
we can stay here till the trial ?
yep .
oh , that &apos;s correct , counselor .
you know , they don &apos;t call it
the king kamehameha suite for nothing .
we &apos;re gonna live like royalty , baby .
all right .
so the floor is secured , place is locked down .
every king needs his queen and here she is .
you know , i didn &apos;t realize
you cared so much about my safety .
i &apos;m , um , i &apos;m deeply touched .
you know , i &apos;d feel a lot safer
if you were by my side until the trial starts .
okay . you know what ?
i &apos;m glad your lawyer &apos;s here ,
because i &apos;m gonna hit you ,
and i want proof that it was provoked .
oh , you know ,
give me your best shot , spicy .
you know , because it &apos;s been a long time
since i felt a woman &apos;s hands on my body .
is he always this creepy ?
yes .
yeah , pretty much the whole time we &apos;ve known him , mm @-@ hmm .
take off your dress
so i know you &apos;re not wearing a wire .
you know , for the record ,
i knew you were a cop .
i just wanted to see you , you know ...
naked .
let me hit him , please .
hey , yo , mcgarrett .
all right , so , the results came back
from that sketch artist composite
that the mullet gave us on the shooter .
photo imaging system says no hits .
well , any gangsta worth their salt
wouldn &apos;t be in any system .
you were .
i got hate coming from every direction , huh ?
where &apos;s the love ? i thought we were &apos; ohana .
yeah , max ?
i &apos;ll be right there . i got to go .
oh , if that &apos;s room service , i &apos;m starving , man .
that &apos;s for me .
what &apos;s happenin &apos; ?
you &apos;re early , for once .
yo , you didn &apos;t tell me five @-@ 0 was gonna be here .
everything all right ?
everything &apos;s fine .
the guy &apos;s got the wrong room . sorry , pal .
excuse me .
you &apos;re lying .
okay . i &apos;m lying .
come on , man . this is my friend bones .
i do his dreads .
he manages my dreads .
bones is a shaper from the west side .
why didn &apos;t you just say that ?
we got to tell &apos; em .
tell us what ?
uh , okay . bones might not be what you call
a legal citizen of the united states .
okay , let me guess .
your friend here has connections to the human trafficking world .
exactly . that &apos;s why i called him .
with bones &apos; street cred ,
i think he &apos;s gonna be able to help us out .
okay .
but if my man comes on board ,
i expect him to have a green card waiting for him
when this is all over . win or lose .
is it ... is it just me
or does he actually sound like a lawyer ?
no , it ain &apos;t just you .
a green card .
green card .
it &apos;s a deal .
deal .
there you go .
okay . irie , bruddah .
what &apos;d i tell you ?
blessed .
the victim &apos;s approximately 25 years of age .
he was discovered floating off waikiki beach this morning .
cause of death-- gunshot wound to the head .
okay , and what &apos;s this got to do with sang min ?
quite a lot , actually .
the slug i pulled from our victim
was a ballistics match to the gun that was used
to murder james lam .
which mean lam &apos;s competitors killed both men .
if we are to believe sang min &apos;s account of events , then yes .
all right , but if t.o.d.
was before we took sang min out of prison ,
then that would create reasonable doubt .
well , unfortunately , the condition of the body
makes it very difficult to determine the precise time of death ,
however , i can confirm it was within the last 72 hours .
well , that &apos;s within the timeframe when sang min was released .
yeah , it doesn &apos;t help our case .
who is he ?
his name is carlos sarte .
uh , his prints showed up in the national i.d. system
for the republic of the philippines .
however , there were no records
of him actually entering the united states .
well , he could &apos;ve been smuggled into the country illegally .
all right , we need to track down his family in the philippines ,
find out who his connections are here in o &apos;ahu .
and see if we can figure out who brought him into this country .
if we do that , maybe we can i.d. our shooter .
thanks , max .
oh , where was i ?
you were telling about the time you almost killed five @-@ 0 .
oh , yeah .
gun !
anybody hurt ?
good !
good !
out of the car right now !
promise me you will not-- under any circumstances--
repeat that story while you &apos;re on the stand .
do you understand me ? not a word .
they instigated it !
what did i just say ?
i can &apos;t hear .
i got bubbles in my ear .
i &apos;m sorry .
we know that you and your brother
came into this country illegally .
we need to know who brought you in .
andrea , this information
could help us find out who killed your brother .
now , we know you &apos;re scared .
but anything you could tell us would be helpful .
the man who brought us called two days ago
asking for more money or he would report us to immigration .
is this the man ?
no .
okay . can you , uh , can you describe him to us ?
he &apos;s , um , korean , i think .
tattoo on his neck and , uh , long black hair .
is that him ?
yes .
he &apos;s the one who called us .
that man killed my brother .
who is he ?
carlos sarte .
our victim &apos;s sister just i.d. &apos; d you for his murder .
yeah , she said you brought her and her brother
over from the philippines .
well , how am i supposed to do that when i &apos;ve been locked away
in a cement hole for the past year ? !
you can relax . we believe you .
look , someone must &apos;ve gotten to her .
made sure that she i.d. &apos; d sang min for her brother &apos;s murder .
yeah , the shooter . right ?
he knew the bullet that killed lam would lead us to sarte .
okay , look , i &apos;m glad everybody here thinks
the career criminal is telling the truth ,
but we got a bigger problem now .
you just gave the prosecution their star witness .
you know , i could have her in a crate
back to the philippines in seven hours .
what ? i thought we were problem solving .
okay , buddy , yeah .
okay , i &apos;ll talk to you soon , bye .
that was danny . he just landed in jersey .
he and clara headed to the bank .
and then danny &apos;s gonna take matty &apos;s money to the fbi .
you think he &apos;s right ?
that this whole thing dragging clara and danny in
was just a ploy to rattle our cage ?
yeah , i do .
i think somebody has us in their sites ,
and i got a feeling this is just the beginning .
yo , what wrong with you ?
no , i tell you already !
i never even talked to that bobo !
no , no need to get bad mind !
you &apos;re all that i want ! there &apos;s nobody else !
sure .
anyway , we talk later .
miss you , too .
thank you , brother .
anything else i can do for you , brother ?
i mean , i &apos;m driving you around .
you &apos;re using my damn phone .
you want me to stop by a restaurant ,
get you some lunch ?
it &apos;s all right , man . i &apos;m not really hungry right now .
maybe later .

rory .
rory have the hookup on bringing people into the island .
‭ then ...

but him hear everything
that &apos;s going on in the trafficking game .

we &apos;ll find him .
hey , yo , mcgarrett ?
so this mutt in the ambulance just confirmed
that clark killed james lam .
will he testify ?
if he comes out of surgery .
your honor , ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
the prosecution is going to present evidence ...
objection .
jerry , it &apos;s my opening statement . you can &apos;t object .
oh . sorry .
i just always wanted to do that .
yeah , while we &apos;re on the subject , i also object .
to what ?
well , according to the constitution ,
i have the right to be tried by a jury of my peers .
and neither of them are my peers .
that hurts .
i must remind the jury
it is against the rules to interact with the defendant .
relax , judge ito .
my fellow juror was just responding
to a character attack .
hey , where you get those ?
mini bar ?
hey , you can &apos;t eat .
you &apos;re on the jury .
we could be sequestered for days .
it &apos;s a mock trial .
room service .
who the hell ordered room service ?
that would be me .
and i object to your use of language ,
&apos;cause this is a place of law .
order &apos;s been cancelled . mahalo .
a man &apos;s life hangs in the balance , okay ?
i &apos;m asking just for a couple of hours
to work on some things before going into court on monday .
so how about we show a little professionalism ?
yeah , you heard my lawyer @-@ barber .
show some respect .
i &apos;ll participate , but only in silent protest .
me , too .
i appreciate that .
max , would you please ?
the defense may call upon their first witness .
once is enough with that . okay .
uh , defense calls officer kono kalakaua of the five @-@ 0 task force .
all right .
my beautiful sister ,
do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ,
and nothing but the sweet truth ?
uh , i think you &apos;re butchering that , but i &apos;ll say yes .
that work for me .
officer kalakaua , everybody knows the five @-@ 0 task force
has had run @-@ ins in the past with my client .
you could say that .
yet even with your history , you stand here today
in defense of my client ,
believing him innocent of the crime .
is that correct ?
yes , it is .
well , that is quite the turnaround , no ?
i mean , you did arrest him .
people change , counselor , and i can honestly say ,
in all my time on the five @-@ 0 task force ,
no one has changed more than sang min .
that might be true ,
but these photos are mug shots ...
... taken of sang min for crimes committed
during his illustrious career as a criminal .
looks like an evolutional chart .
only , it &apos;s going the other way .
do you recall
what offense you committed when this mug shot was taken ?
why don &apos;t you tell me , paco ?
i &apos;d be happy to .
it &apos;s from ...
your early years as a criminal mastermind .
when you and james lam were arrested for extortion .
only , lam never went to prison .
and you did , for a whole year .
that , my friends , is motive .
ah , take it easy , matlock .
yeah , i hated him , but i wouldn &apos;t kill him .
no , death just ain &apos;t my bag , baby .
well , if james lam were here today ,
i &apos;m guessing he &apos;d disagree with you .
well , seeing as he &apos;s dead , i guess we &apos;ll never know , huh ?
how very convenient .
the prosecution rests .
mcgarrett should &apos;ve called saul .
maybe we should take the deal .
thank god . please , tell me clark &apos;s guy pulled through
and he &apos;s willing to testify .
he died in surgery .
well , what about clark ?
can we find him ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s in the wind .
it &apos;s up to you , bruddah .
time for you to shine .
what are you doing ?
odell , the judge just put you on the clock .
you got ... you got , like , four minutes to get in there .
i don &apos;t need any more pressure , mcgarrett , okay ?
i &apos;m panicked enough as it is .
what are you panicked about ?
you got this . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
yeah , well , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m glad you think so .
what are you talking about ?
look , i promised myself i would never be like my old man ,
and now you &apos;re asking me to just ...
break that promise .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know , it &apos;s funny , my , uh ...
my dad and i didn &apos;t talk for a long time .
years and years .
i regret that time in my life ...
more than pretty much anything that &apos;s ever happened .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on between you and your dad , odell .
it &apos;s not my business .
but ...
whatever it is , you gotta resolve it .
or you gotta let it go .
because right now ...
right now , there &apos;s a courtroom full of people in there ,
and there &apos;s an innocent guy waiting for you ,
so what do you want to do ?
&quot; e ho mai ka ike mai luna mai e . &quot;
&quot; come , come bring us knowledge and wisdom from above . &quot;
you only said half the prayer .
i only know half of it .
better than nothing .
better late than never , counselor .
tell you what .
you win this case , i &apos;ll let you cut my hair .
my client , sang min sooh , is innocent .
he did not kill ... james lam .
no .
he was acting as a confidential informant
for the five @-@ o task force when the , uh , incident in question occurred .
now , we all know the five @-@ 0,
and @-@ and @-@ and @-@ and we know all the hard work they do ,
protecting this great island of oahu .
their investigation into human trafficking
led them to james lam ,
and they needed sang min sooh &apos;s help to bring him to justice .
and sang min was more than willing to help .
he didn &apos;t waver .
he didn &apos;t ...
he didn &apos;t worry about his own safety .
he ...
just said yes .
he just said yes .
most people would call that heroic .
thank you .
not bad for a barber .
and you &apos;re 100 % certain
sang min sooh fired the murder weapon ?
our crime lab technicians
conducted a gunshot residue test on scene .
the result was positive .
the slug that was pulled from james lam matched the gun
that sang min was in possession of at the crime scene .
was sang min sooh wearing a wire ?
no , uh , it was too risky .
we needed to give him some space to protect his cover .
which means you didn &apos;t have eyes on him at all times .
so then you have no proof
sang min sooh didn &apos;t kill james lam .
no , but we ...
no further questions , commander .
prosecution rests .
counselor martin .
counselor martin ?
yes , yes , yes .
you may call your first witness .
the defense calls sang min sooh .
aloha , judge .
sang min , you &apos;re the only person in this courtroom
that knows the truth ...
about james lam &apos;s murder .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
okay , well , that @-@ that would explain
why , uh , you were holding the murder weapon
when hpd arrived and why you tested positive for gsr .
that &apos;s the fact , jack .
um , your honor , defense would like to present
exhibits a and b to the jury .
proceed .
thank you .
uh , these ...
these photographs are of the shell casings
found at the crime scene .
one is near the body , as you see ,
but the other ... was found by the inventory of the warehouse .
that &apos;s where sang min said he encountered the shooter .
so the @-@ the locations of these shell casings
corroborate his story .
objection .
counselor is speculating .
your objection was more convincing , bruddah .
shh ! sustained .
um , thank you .
can you tell us the name of the man you fought with
at the crime scene ?
graham clark .
your honor , i &apos;d like to show the jury exhibit c .
proceed .
thank you .
okay .
this is a mug shot of graham clark ,
who is a suspected human trafficker .
is this the man you fought with ?
yeah , that &apos;s him .
your honor , i object .
mr. clark &apos;s not on trial here .
sang min sooh is .
sustained .
um , i ...
withdraw the question .
do you wear prescription glasses ?
huh ?
do you wear prescription glasses ?
glasses ?
yeah , glasses , eyeglasses . do you wear them ?
i &apos;m the perfect package , bruddah .
no imperfections here , huh ?
yeah , well , maybe you &apos;re not so perfect .
do me a favor .
read the hawaiian state seal right over there .
don &apos;t look at me .
read the seal .
go ahead , read it .
you can &apos;t read it , can you ?
no , i can &apos;t .
huh ? !
now why don &apos;t we , you know , get back
to the regular scheduled program , huh , judge ?
have you ever suffered a head trauma ?
‭ does this head look trauma &apos;d to you ?
sang min , isn &apos;t it true that lieutenant chin ho kelly
of the five @-@ 0 task force hit you across the face
with an ash tray the first time he met you ?
i don &apos;t remember !
judge , please instruct my client to answer the question .
the witness will answer the question .
yes .
lieutenant kelly hit me .
but to be fair , eh , probably deserved it .
i &apos;m gonna sue you for entrapment .
and when i &apos;m done collecting ,
i &apos;m gonna find that little hottie you sent in here ,
and this time , i &apos;m gonna be less of a gentleman .
i have no further questions for the witness , your honor .
mcgarrett , your man is leaking oil .
he &apos;s doing something . hang on .
okay , i need you to do something for me .
uh ... defense calls dr. max bergman once again to the stand .
the bullet that struck mr. lam hit center mass ,
and there was no starring around the entry wound ,
which would suggest that the shot that killed mr. lam
was fired at a distance .
okay , and now in your expert medical opinion ,
is it possible to suffer long @-@ term vision problems
after sustaining a head trauma
like the one my client received
at the hands of lieutenant kelly ?
in my expert medical opinion ,
blunt ocular trauma is known to cause myopia ,
which in layman &apos;s term is nearsightedness .
nearsightedness .
officer kalakaua ,
is it true that you &apos;re an expert in marksmanship ?
yes .
okay , the murder weapon used
was a beretta model 86 cheetah .22 .
now , how accurate would you say that gun is ?
the beretta model 86 has a short barrel ,
which means if fired at a distance ,
it &apos;s highly unreliable .
highly unreliable at a distance .
so what would you say the probability is
that a man with poor eyesight
who hasn &apos;t fired a gun in over a year
could shoot a man dead center mass
with a beretta model 86 from 60 feet away
in a dark environment ?
i &apos;d say it &apos;s nearly impossible .
it is mandatory for every inmate to receive a physical exam
before entering a prison in the united states .
i pulled sang min &apos;s records from halawa .
he did a short stint in 2008,
at which time his eyesight was 20 / 20 .
however , his most recent exam earlier this year
showed his eyesight to be 20 / 100 .
apparently , mr. sooh was offered spectacles at the time ,
which he declined .
with my client &apos;s poor vision ,
there is no way he could have fired the shot
that killed james lam .
thank you , commander .
you &apos;re welcome , counselor .
my client has a checkered past ,
littered with bad decisions ,
but ... this case isn &apos;t about the past .
this case is about the here and now ,
and the truth regarding the here and now is this--
there &apos;s no way anyone can say
beyond a reasonable doubt that my client is guilty .
and if you believe the word of the five @-@ 0 task force
that the true killer &apos;s still out there ,
well ...
then you cannot in good conscience
convict an innocent man .
mahalo .
madam foreman , has the jury reached a verdict ?
we the jury find the defendant not guilty on all charges .
ooh , i &apos;m back , baby .
hey , uh , i thought you weren &apos;t a lawyer .
piece of cake , right ?
&quot; piece of cake . &quot;
hey , pop .
it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s odell .
uh , yeah , i know , it &apos;s been a while .
you got some time ?
i was thinking that maybe we could talk .
was that the last pair in the shop , bruddah ?
hey , what do you know about fashion ?
your face is on your t @-@ shirt .
makes an excellent point .
hey , you know , i think ... i think
it makes you look smart .
oh , smart &apos;s as good as sexy .
i knew you &apos;d come around , spicy .
the ladies always do .
no , i take that back .
yep . told you .
aloha .
how &apos;s it ?
what &apos;s up ?
all right .
time to make good on your deal , buddy .
oh , no , no , no .
i was only kidding .
you know , the prospect of going away for the rest of my life ,
you know , clouded my judgment .
eh , sorry , a promise is a promise .
seriously , guys , i thought we were &apos; ohana .
oh , we are .
hold still , i don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
spicy , help me .
