back in the &apos; 80s , stand @-@ up comedy exploded .
we &apos;d spent hours watching the greats like sam kinison ,
garry shandling , billy crystal ,
and , my personal favorite , the diceman .
i can &apos;t believe he said that !
i know !
they weren &apos;t just my heroes .
they were my inspirations .
sure , i never stood
in front of a red brick wall with a microphone .
but i still fancied myself quite the comedian .
nothing but rim .
yep , i wasn &apos;t afraid to get my hands dirty to get a laugh .
oh , you got a little something .
uh , right here ?
right here . - oh , right -- right -- right here , yeah .
and i knew one day i &apos;d get
the get the ultimate achievement in comedy --
class clown .
sorry i &apos;m late . yearbook is killing me .
here , let me carry that for you .
so you can see who &apos;s getting voted class clown ?
nice try .
please . just let me see it .
for your sugar bear ?
just take it .
yes ! i got best hair on a man .
oh , yeah .
shut up , dave kim .
read it and weep . i am ...
unfortunately , i got the opposite of that .
&quot; nicest guy &quot; ? are you freaking kidding me ?
what ? it &apos;s a good thing .
no , it &apos;s not .
&quot; nicest guy &quot; is code
for &quot; boring guy who just has okay hair . &quot;
so , who &apos;s getting class clown ?
better not be mike levy
&apos;cause he didn &apos;t choose for milk to come out of his nose .
he has a deviated septum . so lucky .
david sirota -- by a landslide .
are you kidding me ?
people think that putz is funnier than me ?
okay . whoever &apos;s doing that , just stop it !
just stop right now .
david sirota isn &apos;t funny . he &apos;s ridiculous .
always dancing in the halls and talking trash at gym .
and this bit with mr. woodburn --
amateur hour .
everyone knows making poots is cheap .
i am an adult and an educator ,
and i command you to stop right now
in the name of stephen hawking .
just stop it !
is sirota funnier than me ?
for sure , bro . you &apos;re not funny .
of course i am ! it &apos;s a fact .
like africa &apos;s hot or the sun sets in the west .
i don &apos;t know about that stuff ,
but i definitely know you &apos;re not funny .
erica , back me up here .
i &apos;d like to , but barry &apos;s right .
you use comedy as a defense mechanism ,
but that doesn &apos;t make you
a funny person that people laugh with .
it makes you a lame @-@ o that people laugh at .
but funny &apos;s my thing .
i mean , i &apos;m not an athlete or a brain or a theater star .
so , if i &apos;m not funny , what am i ?
you &apos;re really nice .
stop saying that !
i &apos;m funny ,
and there &apos;s nothing you or anyone else can say
that can change my mind .
that &apos;s right , squishy .
i think you are the funniest boy in the whole wide world .
we rest our case .
you &apos;re a wild and crazy guy !
again , we rest our case .
it was may 10 , 1980 @-@ something , and my dad was pondering
the number @-@ one issue plaguing all fathers .
okay , i &apos;m going to lainey &apos;s .
not so fast !
you didn &apos;t fill up the car last night .
i want a full tank when you get home , no excuses !
like all dad &apos;s , mine was obsessed with the gas tank .
i drove the car this morning . there &apos;s a ton of gas in it .
all right , let &apos;s take a walk , shall we ?
look at the gas gauge ! look at it !
yeah , so ? it &apos;s half full .
which is as good as empty !
ugh , not this again !
we never break the half @-@ a @-@ tank threshold .
my car , my rules !
fine , then i &apos;ll just walk everywhere
for the rest of my life !
yeah , go out walking in that .
this is how it went with my dad and my sis .
they were the two most stubborn people on the planet .
i told you , no chewing gum with your braces !
god , it &apos;s just a pinch ! i can do what i want !
my gum , my rules .
yep , the tiniest of arguments could last months .
both had to win , and neither would ever back down .
ha ! i win !
even if it meant
going to the hospital with a bubble @-@ gum @-@ related injury .
erica , please .
there might be lightning outside .
good .
i would rather get struck by a bolt of red @-@ hot sky fire
than cave to his stupid will .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;ll fill up the tank .
no . you got to back me up on this .
my car , my rules .
i support you on every stupid , little thing .
you mean sit in your chair and blindly yell ,
&quot; listen to your mother &quot; ?
exactly .
no .
do not back him up on this . he is wrong , and you know it .
just do what your father says .
i can &apos;t deal with you people !
it seemed round one went to erica .
god , i can &apos;t wait to get out of this house
and get away from you !
but actually , round one went to my dad .
and that is how you parent .
man , barry and erica have really got in my head .
am i unfunny ?
are people laughing at me , not with me ?
absolutely not .
you got your sense of humor from me ,
and i &apos;m hilarious .
* my girlfriend had a kitty *
she came from kansas city
oh , my god , stop .
hilarious .
but i still need to find a way
to beat david sirota for class clown .
well , then , let me help .
you know , when i was your age ,
i was busboying in the catskills .
i saw all the greats .
really ? like who ?
harry &quot; bottles &quot; mcnaughton , stubby kaye ,
the kippleman brothers .
one would talk and then the other one would talk ,
and then the first one would talk .
their act was actually just okay .
yeah , it doesn &apos;t sound very current .
but i &apos;ve , like , memorized tons of jokes
from all my favorite comedians .
maybe i can bring some of their stuff into school .
yes . let others do the work for you .
and so , i pulled out all the greats .
great wall of china !
first , sam kinison .
aah ! aah ! say it ! say it !
and then i sprinkled in a little gallagher .
and then finish them off
with a classic poem by andrew dice clay .
old mother hubbard went to the cupboard
to get her dog a bone .
when she rover took over
and gave her a
go to your room !
i &apos;m sorry i yelled and punished you .
yeah , i hadn &apos;t seen that side of you before .
i just don &apos;t understand how you could say
those horrible things about old mother hubbard .
that &apos;s her dog . they &apos;re friends .
i guess barry and erica are right . i &apos;m not funny .
pal , you &apos;re funny , but comedy is personal .
think of jokes from your world , stuff you know about .
you think ?
of course .
take my favorite comedian , don rickles .
he tells jokes about the people in his world .
and he keeps it personal .
keep it personal .
yeah . i think that could work .
thanks , pops .
anytime .
old mother hubbard just wanted to feed her poor dog , and he --
got to let it go , man . got to let it go .
meanwhile , erica had a plan on how to defeat my dad ,
and it required stirring up
the most easily stirred @-@ up person on the planet .
damn it ! i &apos;m so mad at dad !
aren &apos;t you mad ?
no . why ? should i be ? what did he do now ?
well , he &apos;s always saying , &quot; my car , my rules , &quot;
and forcing us to fill up his gas tank
like we &apos;re his slaves .
he is always talking about that stupid gas !
it makes me very angry .
well , we can fight back .
i say we pool our money together and buy our own ride .
that way , dad can never say &quot; my car , my rules &quot; ever again .
yes ! let &apos;s fight !
god , i have so much rage in my body right now .
well , let &apos;s do this .
i only have 60 bucks . how much you got ?
oh , i have to move some stuff around ,
but roughly $ 1,200 .
dollars ? how ?
basically , you &apos;ve inherited dad &apos;s stubbornness ,
and i inherited his cheapness .
you see , every day for lunch , mom gives me $ 2 .
i spend 25 cents on chocolate milk
and eat food scraps off friends &apos; plates and random tables .
we can get any car we want .
see ? right here . look at this sweet , little cabriolet .
no , no , no !
it &apos;s my cash , and i know exactly what we &apos;re buying .
a crappy van ?
better .
better , indeed . like every kid back then ,
barry dreamed of being part of the a @-@ team .
they were soldiers of fortune
who drove the toughest , most badass ,
most red @-@ striped ride to ever hit the road .
barry , we are not buying the a @-@ team van .
it &apos;s not happening .
oh , it &apos;s happening .
and i &apos;ll be hannibal &apos; cause i &apos;m the smart one .
we &apos;re getting my sporty little soft @-@ top , understand ?
end of discussion .
and with that , barry did exactly what he wanted .
he bought the van .
stop sign ! that &apos;s a stop sign !
what &apos;s that smell ?
the smell of action .
what the hell is this thing ?
freedom . my van , my rules .
this is why i eat garbage .
in the standoff of stubbornness with my dad ,
erica had taken the upper hand .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
who buys a crap van
with bald tires , a broken headlight ?
and look -- it &apos;s leaking oil on my driveway .
it &apos;s even worse in here . no way !
you &apos;re not driving this . it &apos;s a death trap .
forget about driving it . they &apos;re not keeping it .
oh , yes , we are . face it . i won .
my van , my rules .
oh , that &apos;s too bad
because it &apos;s my house , my rules .
house trumps van .
you can &apos;t do that . you can &apos;t just change the rules .
well , that is a valid point , but , uh , tough crap .
this isn &apos;t fair . we paid for it .
paid for it !
with our own money .
money !
and if it &apos;s your house , your rules ,
then we &apos;ll just move out and live in the van .
live in a van !
wait , what ?
don &apos;t think of it as a van .
think of it as a studio apartment of freedom .
i don &apos;t think i can agree to live in a van .
well , i love this idea .
murray , no !
our babies can &apos;t live in a van .
they could get snatched
by a kidnapper who wouldn &apos;t need a creepy van
because he &apos;s being conveniently provided with one .
but none of that matters
&apos;cause you completely back me up , right ?
blindly and without question ?
fine , i &apos;ll back you up .
even though i did make cobbler la mode
for dessert tonight .
that &apos;s french talk for &quot; pie and ice cream . &quot;
stay with me , and i &apos;ll let you paint a red stripe .
how does that sound , hannibal ?
erica wins !
she called me the tv character i like .
both erica and my dad refused to stand down ,
so i decided to lighten the mood with a little stand @-@ up .
hello , there , everybody .
seemed like it was a good time for a little comedy .
no .
no , thank you .
go away .
so , i hear
erica is gonna be hanging out in the back of a van .
or as she likes to call it , a typical saturday night .
zing !
what is this ?
and , of course , there &apos;s my mom .
always saying , &quot; i have failed as a mother . &quot;
crazy , right ?
although , if you think about it ,
two of her kids are living in a van ,
and the other one &apos;s gone into comedy .
ay @-@ oh !
what is this ?
and look -- there &apos;s the mur @-@ man .
my dad is such a slothful sack of crap ,
even his armchair &apos;s like , &quot; really ? again ? &quot;
what the hell is this ? !
i bombed .
see , the problem here
is you horribly misinterpreted my advice .
you said , &quot; do rickles . &quot; i did rickles !
no , i said come up with personal material like rickles ,
not do insult jokes about your family to your family .
the good news is ,
you had no problem coming up with the funny .
now all you got to do is find the right audience .
really ? you think if i come up with something big ,
i still have a shot at class clown ?
absolutely .
now , don &apos;t misinterpret my advice again .
don &apos;t be hurtful . just be funny .
i 100 % got it .
but i didn &apos;t .
desperate for an easy laugh , i iced a hat box
to give to my overly sensitive science teacher .
and it would be epic .
what &apos;s this ? it &apos;s not even my birthday .
trust me . you deserve this .
so , you just ...
you don &apos;t know how much this means to me .
i ... i honestly thought about quitting this job .
i thought you kids didn &apos;t care about science .
but this cake means the world to me ,
changes everything .
thank you so much , adam .
my new life starts today !
who wants a piece ?
we &apos;re looking at what ? a mean @-@ spirited prank ?
pretty much .
okay , then .
everyone read chapter six . i &apos;ll be in my office .
i need some time to think .
do not knock on this door .
dude , that was brutal .
come on , guys . it was a joke .
i @-@ it &apos;s me , the class clown .
it &apos;s not official , but it could be , right , guys ?
i don &apos;t know what that was , but it was mean .
well , at the very least ,
maybe now i won &apos;t be voted nicest guy .
just so you know , i was the one who nominated you .
what ? why ?
why not ? since when is being nice a bad thing ?
since we &apos;re in middle school .
it &apos;s basically the worst thing you can say about a dude .
not to me .
everyone is always trying to be funny or cool
or someone they &apos;re not .
the last thing i want is to be with some clown .
i just want to be with you .
or at least , i did .
i was no longer the class clown or the nicest guy in school ,
and it felt awful .
meanwhile , erica and barry were feeling even worse
in their stinky new home
adorned with a poorly painted red stripe .
god , come on ! would you quit moving ? !
you keep kicking me in the face !
hey , you &apos;re the one who wanted to sleep head @-@ to @-@ feet .
well , i am not sleeping face @-@ to @-@ face with you .
it &apos;s super weird .
no , what &apos;s super weird is we &apos;re living in a fricking van .
look at us . we &apos;re van people .
i don &apos;t want to be van people .
you should have just filled up his damn gas tank .
barry , this is not about the gas .
it &apos;s about freedom , honor ,
and rubbing it in dad &apos;s face when i win .
but how long is that gonna take ?
until he cracks .
but dad &apos;s too stubborn , and i &apos;m too hungry .
can &apos;t i just sneak in and grab a giant hunk of brisket ?
no brisket !
our days of food and comfort are over .
this van is our home now ,
and this canned tuna , our brisket .
now eat it .
stop ! what are you doing ? !
i can &apos;t -- i &apos;m tilting it . - you &apos;re tilting it !
i don &apos;t belong here , okay ? !
stop tilting it !
just take it outside !
brisket !
mama .
it &apos;s me , lovebug .
what are you doing out here ?
eating tuna and getting ready to use the potty bush .
i hate being van people .
shh . i brought you a home @-@ cooked meal .
yes .
go to town .
good boy . like a little badger .
you .
you .
what is wrong with you ? !
you couldn &apos;t even last one night ?
you were supposed to back me up , bevy ,
and that doesn &apos;t mean bringing the boy dinner .
dear lord , what did he do to that corn ? !
well , i &apos;m sick of this , murray . adam was right .
i have failed as a mother , literally .
our children are van people .
please end this .
fine .
barry , i will buy your portion of the van --
full price , in cash .
deal .
my van , my rules ! i win !
you will never win .
you see this face ? this is the face of a winner .
and i don &apos;t care how long it takes .
i will crush you with the weight of a thousand suns .
never !
i will douse your suns with a thousand buckets of water .
stop . i hate how you two always do this .
me ? it &apos;s his fault .
no , it &apos;s both of you .
you both think you &apos;re so different ,
but you &apos;re exactly the same .
so , if you &apos;re not gonna end this , i will .
i demand that you hug each other .
where are the damn huggies ?
turns out my fake cake for mr. woodburn
got me in a very real amount of trouble .
thanks for coming .
as you know , adam &apos;s little joke
has sent mr. woodburn to a very dark and horrible place .
i can assure you , adam is very sorry for what he did .
i &apos;m really , really sorry .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s fine .
but we may be dealing with larger issues here .
when a nice boy like adam acts out ,
it &apos;s usually because ...
something &apos;s going on at home .
what are you saying , earl ?
well , i &apos;m saying it came to my attention
that a couple of your children are van people .
no , no , no . none of our children are van people .
they tried to live in a van ,
but those morons didn &apos;t even make it through the night .
what my husband means
is that there was a minor disagreement
that resulted in our kids briefly moving
into a carpeted vehicle .
what you doing ?
um , i &apos;m just taking some notes .
looks like a &quot; v. &quot;
you better not be writing &quot; van people . &quot;
i can confirm that the &quot; v &quot; is for &quot; van . &quot;
how dare you question our parenting ?
i &apos;ll have you know that we are very loving and kind ,
and each one of our little angels
cherishes every moment spent in our home .
there you are !
erica &apos;s at the bus station .
she told lainey she &apos;s buying a ticket to new york
so she never has to live in your stupid house again .
true to her word ,
my sister went to new stubborn heights by fleeing the state .
we &apos;re blocked in by a bus ? !
how is that even possible ? !
it &apos;s a school !
we &apos;re never gonna make it in time .
oh , yes , you will .
stop with that song !
shut up ! i love you , but shut up !
no , no , no , no , no , not slower ! faster !
hit the gas , barry !
what &apos;s happening ?
why isn &apos;t my &quot; a @-@ team &quot; van working ?
look . you ran out of gas .
but there was half a tank this morning .
morons !
okay , we got to mobilize and track down my little girl .
i &apos;ll call the police and set up a roadblock .
murray , you call all your new york city furniture contacts .
honey , she &apos;s right there .
ohh , my little munchkin . i got to go squeeze her .
no , no , no , no .
i think i should be the one to talk to her .
well , if you were trying to kill us from worry ,
you &apos;re the big winner here .
no , you are .
i know i always talk about
how much i hate this house and your dumb rules .
but when i actually got a chance to go ,
i couldn &apos;t do it .
yeah . this one really got away from us .
i am so damn stubborn that i almost ran away
because i didn &apos;t want to put gas in the car .
all right .
so , you and me , we don &apos;t back down .
i don &apos;t see that as a bad thing .
you don &apos;t seriously believe that , do you ?
oh , yeah .
when i was your age , i was a crappy student .
there was this guidance counselor who told me
that i should take up a trade
&apos;cause no college would ever take a guy like me .
so out of spite , i worked my butt off .
i got into penn state ,
and that &apos;s where i met your mother .
so , i literally wouldn &apos;t be here
if you weren &apos;t such a pigheaded jerk ?
that is correct .
and mark my words , when you do finally leave this house ,
the world better watch out .
but give me a few more years .
i &apos;m not ready to let you go just yet .
as my dad and my sister finally embraced who they were ,
i realized it was time for me to do the same .
mr. woodburn , i made you this .
i don &apos;t get it . what &apos;s the joke ?
no joke .
just wanted to show my favorite teacher
that i &apos;m sorry .
favorite ? wow . thank you .
&apos;cause in the end , it &apos;s not about labels people give you .
it &apos;s about being okay with who you really are .
that was nice , adam .
yeah , well , that &apos;s what i was going for .
and i may not have been the class clown ,
but lucky for me ,
nice guys don &apos;t always finish last .
please welcome david sirota
okay , enough with this potty mouth in the leather trousers .
i &apos;m gonna show you what funny was back in my day .
* i took my new girl to the fishing hole *
* i gave her my jacket &apos; cause she was cold *
* i puckered my lips , i offered my tongue *
* and that &apos;s when she said
* &quot; no , thank you . we &apos;re done &quot;
that was ... good .
yeah , i liked the part about the --
what was it ? the fishing place ?
hole .
he said hole .
