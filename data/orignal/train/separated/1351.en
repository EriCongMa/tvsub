Please, someone help me!
Can anyone hear me?! Please!
Save me! Someone please help me!
I'm on my way, ma'am!
As fast as you can!
I'll fly at the speed of light.
No one should treat such a beautiful woman
to such evil.
What are you waiting for, my caped crusader?
I will soon show you.
Save me,
and I'll reward your bravery,
you big, strong superman.
Baby?
Ronald, is everything okay?
Wanna go see a movie?
We could go to the one that tells the story without words,
where everyone communicates
through facial expression and movement.
"Blank Stare"?
Yeah, I was thinking more "Really Quiet,"
but I'm sure you're right.
It did get great reviews.
It did! Right?
And when you were reading them,
I-I know I heard you say the words
"Transcendent" and "Evocative."
And I remember your response was "Boring" and "Boring."
Well, that was last week.
You know, before you and Jack broke up.
I...would love to see that film
this week.
Maybe you should go on your own and tell me how it is.
And leave you?
Absolutely not.
We could go hiking?
Gardner museum?
Strolling...
on the promenade?
Like French people?
Jane, it's okay. I'm gonna be fine.
You will, as soon as I find the right activity.
What about a murder?
Yes! Murder! Mm!
Huh? Rizzoli.
Isles.
At least it will keep me from thinking about
how everything good in life turns to dust.
Thattagirl.
Except we are going to a crime scene --
Okay, and we're walking. We're walking. Uh...
Yes. Go.
It's a plant. The ancient romans used it
as a natural form of birth control.
I'm just saying, it's a terrible name for a hotel --
Silphium suites --
Even if it does conjure up images
of people in togas safely having naked orgies.
You can't have naked orgies if you --
I know. It didn't make sense as soon as I said it.
I realize that.
But it's just a terrible name for a hotel.
You know, uh, the silphium seed pod was heart-shaped,
which is why the symbol is now associated with love.
It works on many levels.
Still doesn't roll off the tongue.
Excessive use of the plant drove it into extinction.
You really miss Jack, don't you?
So much.
Are you doing the screening of "The three stooges" later?
Guard hung it up before we got here.
Is she alive?
Yeah.
Then I'll take a look at our actual victim.
Our victim is Ronald Wallace.
That's his wife Linda.
Her screams got the attention of a guest,
who called security.
Guard opened the door.
Our keys don't open those handcuffs?
No, they're British.
She was blindfolded when they came into the room.
Got more hysterical when he tried to remove it.
Paramedic thought she might hurt herself on the cuffs,
so he sedated her.
When is she gonna wake up?
Couple hours minimum,
depending on how much she had to drink.
Front desk told me the couple stayed here often.
This time, they arrived separately.
They were both given cards. Both cards were used.
And silphium is a plant.
What a stupid thing to name a hotel after.
It's a sex plant.
Better, but still...
Frankie, can you check with housekeeping?
See when they cleaned the room
and if they noticed anything usual.
Will do.
Thanks.
It appears that our victim suffered
a significant blow to the head.
Mm. Like from the footboard?
The head wound is differentiated,
which would be...
consistent with an uneven object like that.
And I do see a dried, dark substance on the surface,
but I can't be sure until after autopsy.
Mm, maybe batman slipped when he tried to fly in
and save his mistress in distress.
Batman didn't fly.
Well, he...leapt great distances
in a... bat-like and heroic manner.
Yes, but that's not flying. Not like superman.
Let's track down the security guard.
Maybe the wife said something before she started screaming.
Why did superman fly?
Because of the stronger gravitational pull
on his home planet of Krypton,
Earth's gravity had no affect on him.
Well, then why didn't he fly all the time?
I have no idea.
Doctor at the hospital said
that the wife is still extremely agitated.
That's not surprising.
They're keeping her mildly sedated,
but she's due to be released this afternoon.
Maybe we can talk to her then.
Look what C.S.R.U. found when the E.M.T.S moved her.
Where was it?
Between the mattress and the bed frame.
Why put it there?
So it doesn't get lost during the festivities.
Or so I hear.
Anyway... Ronald Wallace was 39.
A real estate developer.
He and his wife have been married 15 years. No children.
Any criminal record or outstanding warrants?
No, but he does have a habit of making large cash withdrawals
from his corporate accounts.
Any corresponding deposits to personal accounts?
No. He also doesn't pay his bills in person.
The money wasn't hidden in the house,
and there's no safety deposit box --
at least none we've found.
So if he was murdered, maybe we've got a motive.
And if he wasn't murdered?
We got a big pile of money that really isn't our business.
Find any kryptonite?
Mm, he clearly wasn't dressed as superman.
Don't let her bait you.
Maura, you're spoiling all my fun.
Okay, then just for the record, no kryptonite.
The cause of death was blunt force trauma.
But given the force of the blow
against the stationary footboard,
There should have been some sort of contrecoup injury
to the other opposite side of the victim's head.
But there wasn't?
No.
The skull fracture requires 500 pounds of force.
This one might've required more.
And since FORCE = MASS x ACCELERATION --
This is physics, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, can I just sneak out the backdoor
and go to the little girls' room like I did in high school?
Oh, I didn't know you took physics in high school.
Well...Mark Roberts was a very cute, very smart boy.
And what happened to Mark Roberts?
He failed physics.
What? It wasn't my fault.
It was totally my fault.
Anyway, for the stationary footboard
to create that wound in our victim's skull,
He would either "A," had to have fallen 18 stories,
"B," have a head that weighs 5,500 pounds,
"C," have flown into the footboard
at 120 miles an hour,
or "D," some variable combination of these factors.
Well, I didn't get any credit for that physics class,
but I'm guessing by the tone of your voice
that none of these things happened.
No.
So he was murdered.
The caped crusader has a nemesis.
Yes.
Or nemesi.
That isn't the plural of "Nemesis."
It doesn't matter. He's not a real superhero.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming in.
Ronald traveled so much.
He just liked to go to the hotel every couple of weeks
and have a little fun.
You know, just -- just pretend.
I wish...
He wouldn't have wanted to... die like that.
We're handling everything with the utmost discretion.
Of course. You've all been so nice and...
I'm sorry.
I thought I was gonna be able to talk about this,
but I don't know if I can.
Well, we just have a few questions,
and then we'll get you home, okay?
Okay.
Did Ronald have a drug problem?
No.
Did he owe money to anyone?
No. Why -- why would you think that?
There were large cash withdrawals from his accounts.
We're just trying to figure out where that money went.
Well, he was in real estate development.
Contractors like to be paid in cash.
Was the window open in your hotel room?
I-I don't know.
Before Ronald died, did you hear anything?
Like what?
Is it possible that someone else was in the room with you?
What are you saying?
That this wasn't an accident?
We suspect that Ronald was murdered.
Someone was...
there?
Oh, my god.
Did you hear anyone?
No. The -- the music was so loud.
Can you think of anything that might help us?
There was a note.
What did it say?
I don't know.
It was slipped under the door at our home.
It was addressed to Ron.
He read it, he -- he folded it up,
he put it back in his pocket.
I could tell he was upset.
But he just said that
the real estate deal had gone south, not to worry about it.
When was this?
It was a month ago.
There were phone calls, too.
A few of them. Hang-ups.
But then they stopped.
I'm sorry.
I went through our victim's cell phone records.
There were a lot of calls from a guy named Larry Price.
He and Ron had a partnership that broke up last year.
They sued each other.
He write the note?
He says no.
They settled out of court six weeks ago,
And he has an airtight alibi for the day of the murder.
So far, it's not a very promising line of investigation.
The partnership broke up because Ron made Larry nervous.
He refused meat and potatoes jobs.
He was only interested in high risk/high return projects.
He was a gambler.
I asked if Ron had a gambling problem.
Larry said that he would've bet on how long
it would take a cockroach to crawl under the sink.
And if he lost, if would've doubled down
on how long it would take the cockroach to come back out.
Well, maybe our vic got in deep with the wrong person.
See if you can find out who that was.
Yeah.
Hey, Gwen told me you made the honor roll.
Everyone makes the honor roll.
Well, I don't think that's true.
I just mean everyone who stays conscious,
does their homework, and manages to resist the urge
to let the air out of their teacher's car tires.
High five.
Kids don't let the air out of the teachers'...tires.
They do?
Well, where am I supposed to learn these things?
Did you hear back from the colleges?
Princeton.
I didn't get in.
No surprise.
My interview got a little bogged down
in the "How I got shot while homeless" questions.
Seemed to make them uncomfortable.
I applied to a bunch of schools.
Still waiting to hear back...
Including B.C.U.
I didn't know you were applying there.
You know, I know people on the committee.
I can make a call for you.
That's a really nice offer,
but I wanna go where I'm wanted.
And if you call them,
then it's not about me.
I should go wash my hands before I dig in to these potato skins.
Jane, we have to convince her to let me make the call.
No, we don't.
College admissions reward many things other than merit,
and Tasha should use any advantage she has.
But she's decided not to do that.
But maybe she -- - So we're going to accept that.
But what if she -- - Because she's going to get in someplace great.
So...now let's figure out more things that we can do
that will cheer you up. Hmm?
Beanpot hockey tournament.
No.
Visiting bass at the zoo.
A jewish music festival.
No.
What would cheer me up is getting Tasha into B.C.U.
Jewish music festival it is.
Klezmer gives me a headache.
Or not.
So are we dating anyone?
Tasha, I'm a cop. Do tell us about Michael.
Korsak texted me. Did you find anything
to support your out-of-control gambler theory?
I didn't. She did.
I was tracking his cell phone,
and I noticed on the dates he took out the big cash deposits,
his phone would move around the Greater Boston Area.
No pattern I could find.
Then the phone would head towards connecticut,
and...
What just happened?
He took his phone offline.
Why?
No idea, but...
Every time it happened,
a different number would ping off the same tower
Almost immediately.
So Ronald has another phone.
Looks that way.
Is it registered to him?
Not that we've found yet.
But that second phone always traveled to a rural region of Connecticut.
Stays there a few days, then heads back to Boston.
When it shuts off, then the other phone reactivates.
Is there anything interesting in that part of Connecticut?
The Mattatuck casino.
So maybe Ronald did have a gambling problem
that followed him home.
Want me to call the casino?
No. They're a state licensed business.
If whatever happened there reflects badly on them,
they won't be helpful.
So what do we do?
You still keep that overnight bag packed and at the office?
Yes. You never know when you'll need a change of clothes
because of some corpse's gaseous liver explosion.
Exactly. Come on.
Where?
We're going on a road trip. Come on!
And then I realized that the casino
is right next to that spa you mentioned.
The Awuc Transcendence Center?
Yep.
The one with the sweat lodge?
The one I asked you to go to six weeks ago?
Yep.
After everything that you've been through
with losing Frost, losing the baby,
I thought it would be a good and healing experience for you?
Yeah.
And you said you'd rather put forks in your eyes than go?
Yeah, we're talking about the same place.
What are you working on?
Uh, just having trouble with this CAD/CAM program.
I'm using the X-ray of the wound from the victim's skull
to try to identify a murder weapon.
Hmm. Find the murderer through the weapon.
It seemed like a great idea,
except every time I run the analysis,
it keeps telling me
that the murder weapon was the footboard.
But physics has already proven that not to be true,
So I must've loaded the data wrong.
Mm, you'll figure it out.
Yes, I will.
Later, 'cause I brought a mix tape!
Thanks, Jane.
It's gonna be great.
For both of us.
*Make a wish, baby*
*Well, and I will make it come true*
*Ain't no risk now*
*Let my love rain down on you*
*So we could wash away the past*
*So that we may start anew*
Hello, Detective Vince.
Hi, Judith. How'd your husband's surgery go?
Flying colors, if the colors are black and blue.
But the doctors say he's gonna be okay.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
The food from the department was very nice.
Detective Frankie Jr. I like your haircut.
Thanks, Judith.
I'm headed out, unless you need help with that.
Oh, no, no, no. This isn't work.
It's just the results of my practice lieutenant's exam.
How'd you do?
92%.
Well, last year, didn't everyone who got better than 89% make lieutenant?
I think so.
Can I take you out for a beer to celebrate?
Some other time. Thanks.
Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
That's a very good score.
Why aren't you happier?
I guess.
It's about what I expected.
You're a bad liar, Detective Vince.
I barely slept last night. I was so excited!
Yes. Me, too! I was so excited for you.
Really? You were snoring.
Well, that's how I hide my sleeplessness.
You know, the concept of ritual sweating
is a global phenomenon.
Everyone always gloms on to the good ideas.
It isn't always associated
with ceremonial or mystical significance.
Turkish baths, for instance. Mm.
What are you gonna do with your gun?
Nothing.
She needs to check in. Dr. Maura Isles.
I thought we were doing this the together.
No. I'm going to go investigate a murder.
Jane, you said this would be healing.
We both need healing.
And I believe in the...
healing power of crime solving.
Oh, Jane.
Maura.
Come on. I know that you're really gonna love this.
And I know that I would really not love this.
That's not the reason that you won't do it.
You're just afraid of what it will stir up.
I'm not going in because... well, I don't need to.
Okay, the way that I'm processing --
You mean not at all?
My way works for me.
Okay? I'm fine.
Maura, I'm totally fine.
Dr. Isles?
If you'll follow me.
Go. Have a good time. I'll pick you up later.
And we're following and we're walking.
And we're smiling.
And I'm leaving.
Okay, thanks.
Well, the casino circulated that photo you sent me,
and, uh, chief of security says nobody recognized him.
Is he someone you trust to be straight with you?
Yes.
The casino works hard to stay on my good side
so I don't make trouble for the folks
who zoom in and out of there all weekend.
So if your guy's a high roller, it's not here.
Is there any other trouble in the area that he could get into?
Well, we're not a big department,
but I feel like we would run into him...
if he were into something sticky.
Okay. Thank you.
You bet.
Rizzoli.
Jane, we've struck out connecting
our victim to anything concrete in Connecticut.
Yeah, no driver's license. No credit cards.
No real estate transactions.
No utility bills. The guy's a ghost.
Hang on a second. Excuse me.
Do you recognize him?
Yeah. I don't remember his name,
but he was in a couple of months ago
for a gun registration.
Uh, Nina, did you check Connecticut gun registry?
Yeah. There was nothing. Let me check again.
Uh, would you be able to pull up his paperwork?
Sure. It'll take me a while, but I don't mind.
Thank you.
Alan Wallace.
Should've caught it. He used his middle name.
Okay. Hang on a second.
Um, thank you. I'm -- I'm good.
Hey, Nina, get me an address.
Hi. Can I help you?
Yes. Um, I'm Jane Rizzoli.
I'm a detective with Boston P.D.
Uh, do you live here?
Yes.
I'm looking for a Ronald Wallace.
You might know him as Alan.
Alan.
So you know him?
Yes. He's my husband.
Who gets to plan the funeral? Her or me?
I don't know.
When did the two of you get married?
About 18 months ago.
I mean, we -- we dated for a year before that.
We...
We met in a bowling alley. He was with a client.
What kind of work did he do?
He was a sales rep for a building supply company.
At least, that's what he told me.
Now did he have any trouble with anyone?
No.
Whenever he came here,
he always brought large amounts of cash.
Do you now if anybody here knew about that?
That was their money, wasn't it?
His and his other...
I'm sorry, Cynthia.
I-I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk about Ronald...
Alan, um, and his other life.
Everything we were,
everything we did, it was all fake.
None of it means anything.
You could still help us find who killed him.
How? I-I don't even know him.
Nothing I know is true.
Oh, god.
Hi.
So she wouldn't stay focused on my questions.
Or couldn't.
What's her alibi?
She was home,
alone, 'cause her two-timing husband was out of town.
Well, if she wrote the note and made the hang-up calls,
she knew about the relationship.
Yeah, which means she could've also known
about the regular trips to the hotel.
But it still doesn't answer the question
of how she got in the room.
It was a first floor room.
It's easy enough to climb through the window
left open by housekeeping.
Or to be let in by housekeeping.
All right, I'll look at the staff again.
Maybe we'll find something.
All right. Well, at least we figured out his superpower.
What was it?
Bigamy.
At first, it was just hot,
and then it was hot and sweaty.
and then I started to smell something.
No, like, um, a flower.
Or the universe.
And then it was just like... boom!
My head just exploded.
Exploded?
Everything that had been weighing on me --
the CAD/CAM program
or Tasha, Jack, you --
They all just resolved themselves.
They did?
Well, it's not like they're magically fixed.
But I feel like I just got some insights and revelations
that would just help me move forward.
You gonna tell me what those are?
No.
Are you mad because I didn't go sweat and smell with you?
Well, I'm not happy that you made me think you were going.
Sin of omission, Maura.
And if I hadn't have done it, you wouldn't have gone.
Maybe. But I'm not mad.
I think that everything you said was 100% right.
That Ambrosia is an underappreciated band?
No. That we all have our own way of dealing with things.
But Ambrosia is a wonderful band.
Right?
Nothing solid from the hotel staff.
No one has a criminal record,
no fingerprints in the room that shouldn't be.
And the maid who cleans the room
swears she didn't leave the window open.
We haven't made a dent in Cynthia's alibi, either.
Cell phone stays put. No movement on her EZ Pass.
Can't find her on the cameras at the train or the bus station
the days before and after the murder.
Can we at least put her around
Linda and Ronald's house at some point?
Not based on her cell phone or credit cards.
The woman never leaves Connecticut.
I mean, if we had something,
we could take a run at her, try to break her,
But we...
We've got nothing.
Hey, Maura.
Okay.
Okay.
She wants to see all of us.
We here for a self-defense seminar?
No, you're here to see one of the fruits
of my sweat lodge revelations.
I'd been struggling with this CAD/CAM program
I'd been using.
It kept indicating that our victim Ron
was killed by the footboard of the bed,
even though the physics of that made it impossible.
But in the sweat lodge,
I realized that the program was right.
Oh, it's the same pattern as the footboard.
Virtually.
I used a 3-D rendering
to have it laser-carved out of a piece of wood
at a shop down the street.
Oh. Go, sweat lodge.
So something like this might be our murder weapon.
Might be?
Well, it could generate the wound pattern on his forehead.
But the question is,
could anyone swing it hard enough to do so?
So which if you is the best user of a bat?
Not me.
Jane. Jane.
Yes. I am a good user of the bat.
Great.
So you will need to generate a bat speed
of at least 68 miles per hour.
Well, that seems fast.
It is fast.
But if properly placed, should generate the force necessary.
Ready, Susie?
Norm is ready, Detective Rizzoli.
Norm?
He's my uncle.
My apologies, Norm.
Well, he left my aunt for a barista.
Screw Norm.
50.
Come on!
Well, the curve ball kinda left you hanging there, Janie.
You wanna step in for Norm, Frankie?
56.
You got anymore, slugger?
Not without beer.
Maybe our killer was a man.
Or just a former college all-star.
When I did background on Cynthia,
I read she got a scholarship.
4-year starter.
Well, what do you know?
There is no joy in mudville. Mighty Casey has struck out.
Maura calculated the velocity of cynthia's swing in that video.
65 miles an hour at point of impact.
Hell, we could use her on the softball team.
Yeah, except you make a bad play, maybe she murders you.
Well, there's a big difference between muffing a ground ball
and having another wife.
Maybe.
We need to find the murder weapon
or figure out where she bought it
or placed her in Boston at the time of the murder,
or all of the above.
Well, I'll get Nina on the research.
Oh, she's already on it.
I've got a search warrant in process in Connecticut.
Sheriff will meet you at Cynthia's house.
So I'm done eating?
No, as long as you're also walking.
Hey, take the whole thing. Bring me the basket later.
I'll call you from Connecticut.
Bye, Frankie.
Bye, ma.
Hey, you want something to eat?
Oh, I had a granola bar at the vending machine.
Okay, that's not food.
There's a burger ready to come out. Let me get it for you.
That's a customer's order.
Yeah.
But they'll wait and drink some more beer.
Frankie told me about your, uh,
score on the lieutenant exam.
Congratulations.
When's the real one?
I'm not sure I'm gonna take it.
Why?
Do I really wanna finish my career behind a desk?
Well, that's a good question.
Exactly.
I think Kiki and I --
You realize that you light up every time you mention her name?
Might be time to ask her out.
I've had three failed marriages.
I just...
Kiki deserves better.
Oh, come on. Your three ex-wives wouldn't recognize you.
And Kiki would be a fool to let you go.
I'm gonna grab you that burger.
Hey. How was Connecticut?
Did you find a big pile of murder weapon shavings
next to a wood chipper?
No. Mnh.
But we did find this
under the carpeting in the trunk of Cynthia's car.
In the frenzy of planning the murder,
She must've forgotten it was there.
A burner phone.
Yep. No fingerprints.
But Nina confirmed that it was used
to make three short calls to Ron's house
in the timeline the first wife gave us for hang-ups.
Seems like a pretty big mistake
in an otherwise buttoned-up crime.
If criminals didn't make mistakes, we'd never catch them.
True.
How did she get in the room?
I mean, did our victim let her in?
And why would he do that?
And if she was already hiding there,
Then wouldn't they hear her crawling out
with her gigantic murder weapon?
Where you going with this?
Well, it's always the spouse.
Just in this case, we have two.
They did it together.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
How do we prove it?
I have no idea.
So...what now?
Well, now we do the only logical thing.
We drink.
How did a sweat lodge get you to a laser-carved baseball bat?
Just a whisper of insight.
As Sherlock Holmes said,
"Eliminate all of the impossible solutions.
Whatever's left, however improbable, is the answer."
Seems like he could've said that in fewer words.
But okay, so tell me about
some of the other sweat lodge revelations.
You mean about you?
Sure.
You really wanna know?
Mm-hmm.
No, you don't.
I said "Yes."
No, the cop part of you that wants answers said "Yes."
But you've convinced me that the other part of you
really wants to figure it out on your own.
I fear that the sweat lodge was not beneficial
to the clarity of our conversations.
You ready to go?
No, I have to ask Korsak something.
Are you okay?
Hmm? Yes. I am.
Sorry. Just thinking about the case.
Um, I'll see you tomorrow morning.
Yeah.
All right.
Bye guys.
Good night.
So I wanna tell you about another idea I had
at the sweat lodge.
Wow. All that discomfort really worked for you.
It did. Anyway, this is about Tasha.
You want me to go grab Jane so you can tell us all at once?
No, no. I wanna get all my ducks in a row before I talk to her.
I'm all ears.
Me, too.
Well, I went to the admissions office at B.C.U.
I didn't help her because Jane said that I couldn't.
But it turns out she didn't need my help.
She got in on her own.
Oh, good for Tasha.
Yeah. But we have a different problem.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
No!
Detective Jane?
Hi, Judith.
Did you put this here?
Yes. Sorry.
I went to get a clean cloth.
Since detective Barry died,
I try to clean his desk when no one is here.
That's very nice. Thank you.
Detective Jane?
Yeah.
I don't know why,
But I feel...
I feel like I wanna tell you that everything's gonna be okay.
You want me to put the blue guy back where he belongs?
No.
No, he's fine right here.
Okay. Okay.
Good night, detective Jane.
Good night.
Um, I don't know what's keeping her. I'm so sorry.
I-I've already told you everything I know.
I-I don't know
How detective Rizzoli thinks I can help.
There's just a few little things.
Uh, I know this must be hard. How you doing?
I'm...
I'm still in shock, I guess,
As I'm sure you can imagine.
You've obviously been around
A lot of people who are mourning over a loss --
How long should we let her stew?
At least until she gets antsy.
If she looks like she's gonna bolt,
You can go in there and use your charm.
How'd you get this idea?
Frost.
I know. I know you don't believe in that sort of thing.
This happens many more times, I'll have no choice.
I know that's not the murder weapon.
It's probably in some wood chipper somewhere.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You and Linda probably stood there together,
made sure that it couldn't be traced back to you,
Ordering it by mail to a P.O. Box,
Using a money order.
I think I'd like to go.
This is a burner phone we found in the trunk of your car.
It made calls to Ronald's house. Short ones.
Hang-ups, we hear.
Do you know how we know that they were hang-ups?
Linda told us.
Did you meet Nina?
She's in charge of incriminating evidence.
There was a note.
What did it say?
I don't know. It was slipped under the door at our home.
It was addressed to Ron.
He read it, he -- he folded it up,
he put it back in his pocket.
I could tell he was upset. But he just said that
the real estate deal had gone south, not to worry about it.
When was this?
It was a month ago.
There were phone calls, too.
A few of them. Hang-ups.
But then they stopped.
The moment we pegged this as a murder,
she turned on you.
She even planted the phone just in case.
So think back to all the times that you were together,
when she had a chance to get in the trunk of your car,
and then I'll need you to answer my question.
What question?
Well, she wanted Ronald dead,
and in a perfect world,
she wanted you to take the fall for it.
So my question is,
were you smart enough to see this coming
and protect yourself?
Detective Rizzoli, after all I've been through,
it seems cruel to keep me -- - Save it, Linda.
Cynthia has a recording of them planning the murder.
Helpful.
Linda Wallace, you're under arrest
for the murder of Ronald Wallace.
Come on.
What did he see in her?
I'm sure she's asking the same thing.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you.
Moscow mule, Table 10.
When exactly did ginger beer become indispensable?
Did you call Kiki yet?
She's coming by later.
Coming by coming by?
Well, it's not a date.
We're gonna talk about winding down our professional relationship
and what might follow.
But coming by the bar...
It's a good sign, huh?
Thank you.
For what?
Encouragement.
I mean, who knows what happens,
but I feel like a new man already.
You're welcome.
Then his 5-color pen
rolls into the flames on his desk
and totally melted.
Okay, you realize that
only nerds think this is funny.
Only a person without a sense of humor
would not think that this is funny.
Agree to disagree.
Agree that you're a stick in the mud.
Nobody's ever said that to me in my entire life!
So what's up?
Okay, you guys are creeping me out.
Maura, go ahead. Tell her.
You tell her.
No, no, no. It's a sweat lodge thing. Go ahead.
Well, we heard about but did nothing to facilitate
your acceptance into B.C.U.
And we also heard that the financial aid offer was...
Shitty.
Watch your mouth.
Sorry.
So our very own Vince Korsak has organized
a B.P.D. scholarship for deserving students,
and you are this year's recipient.
I-I am?
How?
Well, you met all the qualifications.
You're a great kid. You're a great student.
You were...trapped in an elevator with a detective.
You were shot.
The Barry Frost memorial scholarship.
This is amazing.
Congratulations.
Ah! Congrats.
So who was Barry Frost?
Uh, he -- he was a friend.
And -- and he's gonna watch over you.
Come on, Tasha.
Let's mix you up some virgin something
or other to celebrate.
Good job.
Obviously, Barry's scholarship
was sweat lodge revelation number two.
Well, I only had it
because you wouldn't let me call the admissions office
and help her.
Thank you.
What did we learn about Jack?
He's awesome.
Well, we knew that.
And if an awesome guy like that
found his way to me, then...
Another awesome guy will find his way to you.
Exactly.
And the next awesome person
doesn't have to show up for a while.
Okay.
Do you wanna hear my revelation about you?
No, I-I got my own.
You did?
Okay, you can wipe the surprised look off your face.
Yeah, I did.
I was so focused on work and family and you,
and -- and you were right.
I was afraid of what would happen
if I couldn't keep my feelings in -- in that little box.
But I don't have to be afraid anymore.
I got a message.
Everything's gonna be okay.
So I know, no matter what happens, I can handle it.
Jane Rizzoli's strong enough to handle it.
Okay, what is happening with your face now?
That was my sweat lodge revelation about you.
It was not.
No, it was.
It was not. You're just saying that becase I'm saying it.
Why would I do that?
Dramatic effect. Positive reinforcement.
I would never.
You would!
Like the time I got into the fight with that mime.
Remember? You jumped in and you fake budged in.
That was totally different.
It's not!
