&quot; throwing it all away &quot;
you know your tailbone ?
it used to be a tail .
sofia !
that pink part in the corner of your eye ?
it used to be a third eyelid .
ugh , skull is cracked .
they said he went through the windshield ?
v @-@ tach . no pulse !
paddles !
charge to 100 !
donald mercer .
the appendix used to help us
digest tough foods .
now it does nothing .
clear !
the story of our evolution
is the story of what we leave behind ,
what we &apos;ve discarded .
uh , explain , please .
oh , sofia got fruit juice all over it .
and , you know , she could fry the microprocessor in here .
now i &apos;m gonna be late .
and i &apos;ve told her not to play with my leg !
uh , no , you haven &apos;t actually -- ever .
hey , um , i found these .
um , where should i put them ?
what ?
your wheelie sneaks .
oh . trash .
really ?
yeah .
callie , it &apos;s fine .
our bodies only hang on to the things we absolutely need .
clear !
okay , i &apos;ve got a rhythm . i got a pulse .
wait .
the things we no longer have use for ...
no pupillary response , no pain response ,
visible brain matter , no evidence of brain activity .
i think we lost him .
... we give up ...
maybe there &apos;s a mistake , please .
i need to see him .
... we let go .
jared cole , suffered byler &apos;s disease since birth ,
complains of increasing jaundice ,
edema , frequent fevers ...
so his condition has gotten much worse .
and if the bile continues to build up ,
then we &apos;re looking at cirrhosis or possible liver failure .
he has to go on the list now , for a transplant ?
we have one more chance to avoid it ,
uh , a diversion procedure .
we &apos;ll take a piece of his intestine
and create a detour for the bile
to drain out through his abdomen .
i &apos;ll have a hole in my stomach ?
i know , that sounds weird .
but it &apos;s our best shot
so that you don &apos;t feel like you &apos;re getting sick all the time
and so you don &apos;t look like an oompa loompa .
does that sound good ?
sweetie , the doctor asked you a question .
are you a robot ?
jared cole , manners !
i am so sorry .
no , no . that &apos;s a valid question .
no , i &apos;m not a robot .
i &apos;m almost that cool .
i got into an accident , and i lost my leg .
and then they gave me a new one .
can you jump super high ?
no .
see you in there .
after all he &apos;s been through ,
we gotta cut up his perfectly healthy intestine
and put a hole in his belly ?
hey , you saw his bilirubin . he &apos;s out of options .
wilson , go check on his coags before we go to surgery .
you &apos;re gonna need to assign someone else .
wilson &apos;s no longer in peds .
what ? - why ? - you -- you &apos;re suspended from surgery .
what ?
you broke the non @-@ fraternization rule .
and it was just gonna be a slap on the wrist , karev ,
until you decided to give the board the finger .
three days , no surgery . wilson , the e.r.
i have my byler &apos;s kid .
you &apos;re gonna let this rule mess with patient care ?
robbins can take that case .
thanks . makes my day real easy .
well , i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s about to get harder .
h.r. wants to talk to you today .
h.r. ?
the anonymous harassment complaint
came from leah murphy .
oh , god .
yeah , and , legally , h.r. has to investigate ,
and they want you to answer some questions .
and that might be the end of it .
and if it &apos;s not ?
i have no time for this today .
no contact with murphy , okay ?
hey , derek ! are you coming by the lab today ?
we &apos;re starting to lose all our phase two momentum .
yeah . actually , they &apos;re setting up my new office today .
oh , you know what ? i got to grab a sensor .
the guys are going to duplicate one .
ah , yes . the washington guys , mappin &apos; the brain .
you &apos;re actually gonna have time to do this , too , though , right ?
yeah . i hope so . i plan to .
all right . well , let me know when you &apos;re ready .
&quot; oh , yeah . call me . we &apos;ll hang out . &quot;
i haven &apos;t seen a blowoff like that since high school .
it was not a blowoff .
i have nothing against ross .
i just don &apos;t think he should be on my service .
look , he needs to feel that he has your support .
he &apos;s trying to find his footing .
i know , and i think he lost it
because i was not the best influence .
also , we had ...
inappropriate --
shenanigans . i know .
that &apos;s what the rule is for , dr. yang ,
so we can work together without the shenanigans .
i think it &apos;s a bad idea , sir ,
and i think the chief will , too .
well , the chief asked me to keep an eye on ross .
so it &apos;s my call , not his .
and as far as you &apos;re concerned , dr. yang ,
i am still and will always be the chief .
yes , sir .
sorry ,
about what i said .
i was a complete jerk .
i heard you got busted .
yep .
i have to miss out on my education
so they can keep me on a separate floor from alex .
see , i want that rule .
if i find myself alone in a room with jackson ,
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna nut punch him .
so every time he has a consult in the e.r. today ,
i &apos;m taking a break .
you shouldn &apos;t .
you should nut punch him .
we &apos;d all want to see that .
he married her , jo .
one day , he &apos;s with me , the next day ,
he &apos;s not just with her , she &apos;s his wife .
so , what the hell was i all that time ,
that he could just ... toss me aside like garbage ?
oh , my god .
it was right outside --
by the dumpsters .
he &apos;s warm , pulse is weak . he &apos;s breathing fast .
shh ! shh ! shh ! shh !
hey , little one . how are you ?
what are you , like 8 months , 9 months ?
oh , what do we have here ?
you &apos;ve had some surgeries before .
okay . let &apos;s get him up into the picu .
uh , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll get a peds gurney .
so , page cardio and call the police .
get prints , any identifying marks ,
find out if he was born here , seen here .
we &apos;re gonna find out who this little guy is .
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m so sorry !
are you okay ?
oh , i think you broke my leg .
oh , my -- oh , my god ! - it &apos;s all right .
i have another one in my car .
what happened ? !
oh , i &apos;m fine .
i was walking , and -- - what happened ?
i &apos;m fine ! i was --
i had an accident , my leg got broken ,
and someone &apos;s bringing me a spare .
i &apos;m fine .
oh , god ! i &apos;m sorry !
i got it . i got the leg .
oh , dr. robbins , i am so sorry .
edwards , you know what ?
you should go page cardio
and then go do a work @-@ up on the baby .
i &apos;ll go with her .
whoa , wilson , what baby ?
we found a baby in the trash .
no , you &apos;re not doing the work @-@ up .
but it &apos;s my dumpster baby !
you &apos;re not on peds . i have a patient for you .
oh , bailey , um , i have a byler &apos;s biliary diversion surgery today ,
and i lost karev , so can you assist ?
you got it !
okay , everybody out . please .
are you okay ?
yeah , my neck &apos;s a little sore , and my leg is totaled .
oh , geez .
now i have to wear my old beater leg .
i thought you said this chafes you ?
well , it &apos;s better than nothing
until my other one &apos;s fixed .
all right . here .
oh , um , can you make it to round on alyssa cramer ?
the club @-@ feet girl ? she &apos;s back ?
yeah , scar revision .
oh , yeah . okay .
hey , um , listen . h.r. wants to talk to me .
the anonymous harassment claim came from leah murphy .
all right . you good here ?
yeah . thank you . mm @-@ hmm .
i understand that i broke a rule ,
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair for this to affect my education .
you spend more time on peds than any other service .
because i &apos;m interested in peds !
yeah , well , i &apos;m interested in giving you a well @-@ rounded education .
so today , you &apos;re on trauma , and this is your patient .
mr. donald mercer is an organ donor .
he was injured in an mvc this morning .
we &apos;re waiting the 6 hours
to confirm the diagnosis of brain death .
okay .
now , you will make sure that his organs
are in optimum condition for donation ,
and then you will get to scrub in on the organ recovery .
you got it ?
but that &apos;s like six surgeries in one !
trauma &apos;s not so bad now , huh ?
she &apos;s filled out all the donor paperwork .
she just wants a couple minutes with him
before she starts making arrangements .
of course .
excuse me , uh , doctor ?
this isn &apos;t the right time for this , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sure .
i mean , there probably isn &apos;t one .
but i @-@ i feel like it can &apos;t wait .
how can we help ?
donnie had a kidney transplant about four months ago .
yeah , we knew about that .
that was me .
i donated my kidney for him .
wow . that &apos;s ...
he was lucky to have friends like you .
he was . yeah . uh , amazing .
so , um ...
i was wondering , about the kidney ...
can i get that back ?
yeah , i can see you .
i don &apos;t know why you can &apos;t see me .
but we &apos;re still setting up here , so ...
yes , uh , so , then you did get all the proposals ?
uh , yeah . yep . yep . they &apos;re right here .
great , great .
and , um , you &apos;re sending us a prototype
of your asymmetrical sensor ?
yeah , sending it out today .
thank you . thank you so much .
and , obviously , discontinue any other work
you &apos;ll be doing with the sensors ,
and i will e @-@ mail you a release for the patent .
wait , i &apos;m sorry , &quot; discontinue &quot; ?
my work with dr. torres is ongoing .
uh , well , not with your sensors .
they have to be proprietary to the work that we &apos;re doing
our n.i.h. grant is dependent on that .
you understand ?
i &apos;m not sure dr. torres will .
and i have to say , lloyd , i don &apos;t like it .
uh , well , i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m sorry , derek ,
but it &apos;s pretty clear from our agreement --
we and the n.i.h. hired you ,
and your sensors come with you .
oh , hey , little guy .
what do we know ?
he &apos;s had a median sternotomy , a couple of chest tubes .
low sats , high b.p. ,
failure to thrive .
have you cuddled him ?
no , i have not .
well , if i were left in a cardboard box ,
all i &apos;d want is cuddling , right ?
oh , i think i &apos;d want a cardiac cath
to confirm i &apos;ve had a coarctation of my aorta .
he is like a puzzle that i can &apos;t solve ...
oh , whoopsie !
if you &apos;re gonna do that .
do you have a coarctation of your aorta ? do you ?
no record of the baby being a former patient .
the police are getting statements
from edwards and wilson .
oh , that &apos;s right .
um , i have a patient ,
so will you call me when you &apos;re done with his cath ?
ross , you want to take the baby ?
i &apos;d rather not .
ross , take the baby .
come here .
are you squeaking ?
long story .
can i put him down now ?
no . she &apos;s right . he should be cuddled .
you &apos;re not gonna hurt him .
and i don &apos;t want to do it .
did i hear you found a baby ?
yes . in a box , abandoned .
oh , is it all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
i imagine it &apos;s pretty traumatized ,
having been suddenly left behind ,
thrown aside . - stephanie --
dumped , as it were , in the trash .
would you please let me talk ?
you -- you really want to get out of my way .
three days i &apos;m suspended from surgery .
you bang a co @-@ worker ,
and you get a house and two kids .
i do it , and i get suspended .
i know . i &apos;m a hypocrite , i &apos;ve heard .
i &apos;m supposed to do a biliary diversion .
i like this kid .
i &apos;ve been treating him for years .
i want to make sure it &apos;s done right .
but do me a favor . talk to hunt .
see if he &apos;ll start my stupid sentence tomorrow .
i will . i &apos;m gonna talk to him .
thank you . you &apos;re a hypocrite and you suck !
hey , did you hear , uh , grumpy and hairball
found a baby in the trash ?
emma marling came by to get a key for the trailer .
why are you telling me this ?
it &apos;s gossip . i &apos;m gossiping .
oh , okay . shoot .
to get her things because her and owen are through .
through ? why ?
i don &apos;t know . she didn &apos;t say .
but i don &apos;t think it was her idea .
i can &apos;t tell if you &apos;re happy or sad .
neither can i.
it hurts like a bitch , dad !
don &apos;t talk like that !
don &apos;t talk to me like i &apos;m a baby !
we &apos;ve gone over this and --
hey ! hey !
hey , alyssa . herb .
guys , what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re just gonna do another stupid surgery ,
and i &apos;ll still in pain .
simmer down .
no , no . i know .
your arthrogryposis symptoms are worsening ,
but today &apos;s surgery will alleviate the scarring
and hopefully the pain , too .
you said that before my last surgery .
i know .
and the one before that and the one before that !
stop it . - you keep lying to me about --
they are trying -- they are trying to help you !
i have had braces and castings and surgeries ,
and none of it works !
so , i want to know ...
don &apos;t .
... if you can just cut them off .
just give me the fake legs .
then i can still do all the stuff i want to do .
yeah , she &apos;s been talking like this for a month now .
please tell her that i am not gonna allow anybody --
what ? disable me ? dad , i am disabled now !
i still can &apos;t walk !
it hurts when i stand for more than three minutes .
i &apos;ll never run !
it hurts when i try to sleep !
tell her she &apos;s being ridiculous .
you are !
she won &apos;t talk to me .
i live in a bed , dad , and
there are girls running marathons with fake legs !
alyssa .
it has -- it has been a long road .
look at how long .
and i know -- i know it hurts ...
and it feels like you can &apos;t go any further ,
but this is the time you have to be brave
and push through it and have faith .
even if it &apos;s not working yet ,
it &apos;s going to work .
right ?
i &apos;m not so sure about that .
i cannot believe that you didn &apos;t back me up in there .
i mean , a kid wants to cut off her legs !
i &apos;m just suggesting that you don &apos;t dismiss it out of hand .
hey , callie , you got a minute ?
something kind of unexpected came up .
hold on a sec . really ?
because it sounds to me like you &apos;re asking me
to just throw away three years &apos; worth of hard work
and investment in this girl ,
just cut it off and throw it away like it never happened .
and i don &apos;t want to do that .
i &apos;m sorry , derek . what is it ?
nothing . i &apos;m good .
somebody tried to fix his coarctation .
did a hack job .
look , it &apos;s closing up already .
um , i &apos;m going to reopen .
um , prep a balloon catheter .
did you notice anything about his mitral valve ?
i don &apos;t know .
shane , come on .
this is like a puzzle .
i found the corner pieces . i need help with the sky .
the valve leaflets were thickened and shortened .
a parachute mitral valve ?
yes . and there &apos;s a supravalvular mitral ring .
the three indicate ...
coarctation ,
supravalvular mitral ring , and parachute ...
shone &apos;s complex ?
bingo .
a trifecta of congenital heart defects .
that answers another question .
what ?
why they abandoned him .
the kid had one heart surgery .
he needed at least two more .
someone thought he was more trouble than he &apos;s worth .
what are you doing here ? go away .
what are you doing ?
organ donor .
i have to keep him alive until he &apos;s actually dead .
nice .
i &apos;m off peds , and hunt &apos;s got you arranging a meat platter .
i know . but i &apos;m gonna show him .
i &apos;m gonna keep his organs so healthy ,
someone could use his appendix .
you should go . if hunt shows up , he &apos;s gonna --
we could use his appendix .
it was a joke .
we don &apos;t donate --
no , that could work .
karev , don &apos;t make me turn three days into a week .
did i get too close to wilson ?
did an alarm go off somewhere ?
but it &apos;s a donor organ ,
so it can &apos;t be ... regifted .
i don &apos;t understand , though . it &apos;s mine .
yes . yes . it was yours ,
but then you gave it to him .
and now he &apos;s not using it ,
a @-@ and i &apos;m still down one kidney .
i @-@ i loaned him my bike .
i &apos;m probably gonna get that back .
i should wait a month or so .
sir , um , transplanting the kidney
put a pretty big strain on the organ .
to do it again would be risky for you and your kidney .
see ? - his -- his kidney .
you said &quot; my kidney . &quot;
you think i should get it back .
um ... i actually -- i have to be elsewhere right now .
oh . oh , no . of course .
yeah , no . i @-@ i &apos;ll wait here .
ouch .
we don &apos;t have to cut jared &apos;s intestine .
what ?
jared cole .
instead of the intestine ,
we use , uh , the appendix to make the stoma .
it &apos;s easier on him , and it &apos;s , uh ,
repurposing something he doesn &apos;t need anyway .
that &apos;s the same procedure ,
resulting in a cutaneous end @-@ stoma ?
even easier . and the appendix is -- is narrower ,
so a smaller hole in his stomach ,
more normal life .
reduces complications , recovery time , and
oh , crap .
uh , sorry . i @-@ i didn &apos;t know you were , um ...
uh , i can wait till you &apos;re finished .
no , alex , it &apos;s fine .
&apos;cause i never see you like that . you okay ?
yeah . it &apos;s a blister .
i think using the appendix is a great idea .
let &apos;s look into it .
well , i can get him prepped .
whoa , oh . this does not mean that you &apos;re scrubbing in .
i &apos;m sorry .
he just came off his hinges when he saw you .
yeah , there are two different looks that you get .
without the leg on , they feel sorry for you .
and with the leg on ,
they think that you &apos;re amazing and brave .
yeah , or a robot .
any word from the police
about my mystery baby in a box ?
no . social services is on it now .
what &apos;s his status ?
uh , he needs a mitral valve repair ,
which i &apos;m gonna do tomorrow .
he &apos;s already been through enough for one day .
so , what &apos;s this i hear about you being an idiot ?
you broke up with her ?
she was it , owen .
the picket fence , a dozen kids ,
fresh baked goods .
i don &apos;t want to talk about that , okay ?
because you &apos;re dumb ?
no , because it &apos;s between her and me .
and i hurt her , and i feel bad ,
so i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
why throw that away ?
is it because of what happened at the trailer ?
that was -- - give me some credit .
i know what that was .
then why ?
okay , all right .
why are you so upset about it ?
uh , because .
because ... why ?
because of what happened in the trailer ?
i don &apos;t care for the direction this is taking .
i &apos;ll tell you if you tell me .
no .
dr. robbins .
hey , herb .
can i ask you a question ?
do you have kids ?
yes , i do .
i have a little girl .
you have a little girl ,
and you can still tell me
that i should cut my daughter &apos;s legs off ?
no .
ultimately , that &apos;s her decision .
but she can &apos;t make it without your help .
you think her life &apos;s gonna be better with no legs ?
you think kids aren &apos;t gonna stare at her ,
that they &apos;re not gonna make fun of her if she &apos;s crippled ?
disabled --
crippled , disabled --
what -- what difference does it make ? !
i don &apos;t care what you call it .
how can you say that ?
i never thought that i &apos;d carry my daughter
or be a doctor again .
and now there &apos;s very few things i can &apos;t do because of this .
when did that happen ?
i &apos;ve had it since before we met .
i didn &apos;t notice .
why would you ?
herb ...
alyssa &apos;s arthrogryposis is so severe ,
and her muscles put too much strain on her joints .
and it won &apos;t get worse ,
but the pain will never stop .
it &apos;s just me and her now ,
and i don &apos;t want to make the wrong decision .
i know . i know .
she &apos;s your little girl .
46 @-@ year @-@ old male ,
complains of tightness in chest ,
possibly heart @-@ related ,
probably enchilada @-@ related .
pulse in the 70s ,
b.p. 170 / 110 .
trauma two .
you do any more bowling for doctors today ?
what ? you heard ?
oh , it &apos;s all over the radio .
oh , my god .
oh , i &apos;m just saying , the next time you do it ,
try and take out kepner .
oh , god !
that &apos;ll work , too .
guys , i &apos;m fine , okay ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , no . you warned me to stay out of your way .
was robbins your warm @-@ up ?
i didn &apos;t do this on purpose .
edwards , i &apos;m about to take his pants off .
go be someplace where you won &apos;t be a danger to others .
what happened ? !
oh , god .
um ... i &apos;m fine , okay ?
i got hit by a gurney .
there she is !
all right , dr. edwards !
two for two !
hey , chief . can i talk to you for a second ?
yeah . what is it , grey ?
so , it &apos;s about alex karev .
uh , sorry .
um , robbins ? have you been up to h.r. today ?
oh , no . i haven &apos;t had a chance .
we &apos;ve been developing a biliary diversion using the appendix .
right . i was gonna have all the interns observe .
that is a pretty inventive approach .
but , robbins , h.r. needs that statement today .
yeah , okay . um , bailey , why don &apos;t you go on up without me ?
and by the time that you have jared on the table ,
i &apos;ll be done with this thing .
and you should get someone to assist you , too .
oh , uh , i &apos;ll take grey .
wait , no !
well , that &apos;s what i wanted
to talk to you about , because it &apos;s karev &apos;s case .
it was his idea , so he should be on it .
karev &apos;s suspended . you &apos;re on it .
terrific .
hey .
i have to tell karev that i stole his surgery .
oh , i have to tell torres
that the president won &apos;t let her use my sensors any more .
just tell her you made a promise to her ,
but instead , you &apos;re gonna spend
your time and energy on something else .
it worked when you told me .
i thought we were gonna help each other .
you left yourself wide open there .
callie &apos;s a grown @-@ up .
she knows how research works . just tell her .
and karev will be ... understanding about it .
oh , no . i &apos;m not telling him .
did you get to talk to her ?
no . i was on the floor .
she didn &apos;t do it on purpose , did she ?
no . no . i don &apos;t ... think so .
maybe .
well , what about you ? did you talk to matthew ?
i left another message .
nicole said he quit ,
and then she called me a name .
so that &apos;s all i know .
can you just talk to her ,
apologize for both of us ?
i &apos;m trying .
nurses &apos; station .
oh , god . you scared me !
any word on my kidney ? you were gonna give it some thought .
i , uh ... no .
no , i wasn &apos;t .
oh , dr. hunt !
um , do we return donor organs to donors
when the recipient passes on ?
absolutely not .
unos is very strict about this .
um , why do you ... want it ?
well , it &apos;s the principle , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , t @-@ these are not the terms of the agreement .
i donated my organ for a purpose ,
to-- to filter my buddy &apos;s ... pee or whatever it does .
and-- and now it &apos;s just being discarded .
so i @-@ i think i have a right to get my kidney back .
i &apos;m not quite following . is , um , your other kidney failing ?
it-- it could .
you never know what &apos;s gonna happen , right ?
y @-@ you &apos;re just fine , sir .
am i ?
oh , wow ! uh , that &apos;s my pager vibrating .
uh @-@ huh . oh ! oh ! is yours vibrating , too ?
oh , yeah , it is . it &apos;s urgent .
okay .
um , we &apos;re very sorry about your friend .
i &apos;m sorry .
is he stalking you ?
hey .
herb cramer just told me that you were pushing him
toward an amputation for alyssa .
no . i wasn &apos;t pushing anything , callie ,
but , i mean , it &apos;s the right thing to do .
and you &apos;ve done palliative amputations before--
yeah , on a soldier !
a a grown man .
not a child whose legs
i have been trying to correct for three years !
and failing . i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s true .
and honestly , i mean , before last year ,
i think that you would have seen it .
okay . so you think this is about you ?
it &apos;s about alyssa . it &apos;s not about me .
but it &apos;s not about you , either .
why would you say that it &apos;s not about me ?
i didn &apos;t say that it , because i am--
i @-@ i think that you &apos;re afraid to do this amputation ,
and i &apos;m afraid that that might be my fault .
dr. robbins ?
hi . i &apos;m anne from h.r.
we &apos;re ready for you upstairs .
okay , thanks .
i ...
yeah .
there &apos;s just a few questions we need to go over .
it shouldn &apos;t take long .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re busy .
clear !
shane , no !
don &apos;t shock him ! his heart can &apos;t take defibrillation !
i thought so , too .
so i tried to stabilize him with cardioversion--
one shock , timed in the refractory period of his heartbeat ,
to get a good sinus rhythm .
and i think it worked .
good call , ross !
he could have a mitral valve rupture .
uh , clear an o.r. , page robbins ,
and set up for a redo sternotomy .
okay .
they what ? !
they want my sensors proprietary to them ,
which means ...
... they can no longer be used for our research .
well , we can &apos;t do our research without them .
i know .
well , what are you gonna do ?
this isn &apos;t gonna keep you from doing their project , is it ?
callie , i never expected them to do this .
okay . i &apos;m going to try to fight them on this , but in the meantime ...
you understand ?
uh , i think so .
you partnered up with me ,
but now you &apos;re taking our ball
and you &apos;re gonna go play with your new friends .
i understand that the last six months
was a complete waste of my time .
she understands .
and at that point , dr. torres handed her the drill , correct ?
and that &apos;s when dr. murphy
drilled through dr. torres &apos; patient &apos;s leg
and into the table ?
that &apos;s correct , yes .
at the time of that incident ,
you said you had terminated
any romantic relationship with dr. murphy ?
i had , yes .
there was no contact of a romantic or sexual nature after the incident ?
no . there was not .
okay .
oh , i have an emergency .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to --
no problem . that &apos;s really all i need .
well , you -- that &apos;s it ? you don &apos;t need me to come back ?
mm , no . or do you have more ... ?
no . no . it &apos;s just , i mean , if i &apos;m being accused of something ,
i think that i should have a little more time
to , you know , to speak my -- - oh , no . don &apos;t worry .
dr. murphy didn &apos;t lodge the complaint against you .
thank you .
hey . what happened ?
oscar had flash pulmonary edema .
his mitral valve blew . i &apos;m gonna go fix it .
ugh , i was stuck in h.r.
is murphy coming after you ?
worse , actually . her complaint is against callie .
callie ? why ?
i don &apos;t know .
no , i mean , i know , but i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to believe it .
right -- &quot; oscar . &quot;
&apos;cause you found him in a trash can .
hey , do you need to be in your byler &apos;s surgery ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m good here .
you sure ?
yeah . i &apos;ve got ross .
okay , that &apos;s callie now . um , come find me after ?
yeah . okay .
tell dr. bailey to go ahead and start without me .
i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can .
they asked for you .
i just need to hear it again .
tell me that you think this is the right idea .
i do .
dr. torres has done everything
that anyone could do to stop your pain ,
but -- it &apos;s not working .
and by every indication ,
more surgery will just mean more time in a hospital bed ,
more scarring , and the same results --
pain for the rest of her life .
she &apos;ll never run ?
i &apos;ll never ... walk her down the aisle ?
not unless we amputate .
instead of the surgery that you have scheduled for today ,
please schedule a double amputation .
i want her pain to stop today .
okay .
thank you , daddy .
callie .
no , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s just one more thing today .
h.r. wants to see you .
leah murphy &apos;s complaint is against you .
they wanted hunt to tell you , but i asked if i could .
i thought that i , you know ...
okay , well , um ...
i , uh , have to push this amputation --
no , i &apos;ll take that off your plate .
i mean , i &apos;ll do it .
and you come find me when you &apos;re done ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so -- i &apos;m sorry .
you know , i just got through a malpractice suit .
now i have to deal with your jealous ex @-@ girlfriend
trying to ruin my reputation ? !
i swear to god , i can &apos;t take any more of this !
the heart has so many abnormalities .
it &apos;s incredibly fragile .
uh , 4 @-@ 0 prolene .
you have to really be delicate .
i want to ask you about something ,
but there are all these new rules ,
and , uh , the act of me asking might be breaking them .
you can ask .
there was a complaint .
that &apos;s a question ?
i thought it might be you .
it wasn &apos;t .
i know , but it made me wonder
if you ever felt compromised .
because i didn &apos;t want you to .
i didn &apos;t .
good .
oh , now that sounds like coercion .
like i &apos;m telling you how you were supposed to feel .
i didn &apos;t take it that way .
really ?
you &apos;re not just saying that to curry favor ?
no . i &apos;m not &quot; currying &quot; anything .
because you never have to do that .
you don &apos;t have to get shepherd coffee
or fix callie &apos;s baby schedule
or ... relax me .
you &apos;re too good of a doctor for that .
and when you look back in 10 years ,
you &apos;ll be relieved you didn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll even be a doctor in 10 years .
oh , shut up . you will . you better .
now , that &apos;s coercion .
that should be you down there .
who cares ? i &apos;m doing an organ recovery .
screw peds .
i &apos;ll basically be on general , cardiothoracic ,
ortho , plastics , and pulmonary in one operation .
wow . i &apos;ve got to go up to h.r. to fill out an accident report .
oh , for hitting robbins with a gurney ?
for hitting jackson with a gurney .
yeah .
robbins should be here to see this .
looks good .
appendix is holding .
uh , grey , will you intubate the stoma ,
make sure it &apos;s patent ?
oh , crap .
what ? what happened ?
what ? what &apos;s going on ?
he &apos;s gone into v @-@ fib .
i pushed epi and atropine .
did you shock him ? you gotta shock him !
dr. wilson , he &apos;s already gone !
no ! there are at least nine people counting on him not to be gone !
move ! clear !
what are you doing here ?
you asked for a resident .
i &apos;m the only one available .
i &apos;ll do it myself .
are you actually gonna do that ?
you &apos;re gonna refuse to work with --
leah , i cared for you .
i liked you , and that &apos;s all that it was .
and i am sorry that i hurt you .
but if you &apos;re gonna come after my wife now because of the --
i know what our relationship was .
i &apos;m not a child .
i never thought of it in terms of work .
it was you who brought it into the hospital .
you told dr.torres about us ,
and dr.torres chose not to teach me in a moment
that put a patient in danger .
she made me put a patient in danger . so did you .
i @-@ i never thought that --
you were thinking about yourself .
it wasn &apos;t safe , it wasn &apos;t fair , and i had to say something .
because it shouldn &apos;t happen again , to me or anyone .
you want to cut the fibula
1 to 2 centimeters proximal to the tibia .
then you &apos;re gonna reshape the end with a bevel
so that the prosthesis will fit better .
you watching ?
good .
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna do the other leg yourself .
hey . hi , kim .
how are you feeling ?
i feel pretty good .
and you don &apos;t look like a basketball .
you did a good job .
yeah , well , i had to watch them ,
make sure they didn &apos;t screw it up .
get some rest ?
all right .
that was having my back ?
i knew you were a hypocrite , but that was really cold .
stop it . you &apos;re suspended . somebody had to be in there .
read this .
what is it ?
it &apos;s me having your back .
i got it from h.r. it &apos;s a love contract .
a what ?
it &apos;s a declaration of a relationship .
if you sign this and wilson signs it ,
it clears everybody from any claims
of favoritism or sexual harassment .
that &apos;s the stupidest thing i ever heard of .
well , it sounds stupid ,
but h.r. said if you sign this
that it makes the whole thing go away .
so , sign it .
no !
well , then i &apos;m done trying to help you .
i can &apos;t go to her with this .
look , i asked her to marry me
when i was freaking out about my dad .
i scared the crap out of her .
if you guys keep screwing with us --
how are we screwing with you ?
jo wants to be a surgeon , mer .
she came from nothing to be here .
now , cause of me ,
there are suspensions and punishments .
if you keep making it harder , she &apos;s gonna leave me .
and if you make it too hard ,
she &apos;s gonna be like izzie and she &apos;ll walk .
will you just sign the stupid paper ?
watch his sats through the night .
below 85 , page me .
uh , is that oscar &apos;s file ?
the baby ? yes .
and that stays with him , right ?
and his name -- dr.shane ross .
the adoptive parents will have questions .
in 10 years , oscar will have questions .
and you will answer them .
you know , i could sue you guys .
i could sue this entire hospital .
sir , you signed away your legal rights to the kidney
when you agreed to be a donor !
no , he broke our deal .
the -- the terms were i give him my kidney to use ,
and he has broken our deal !
it was a gift !
he threw it away !
thom !
step back right now , or i will call security .
dr.kepner ...
wilson ...
donald mercer suffered cardiac death .
organ recovery &apos;s called off .
it &apos;s all going in the trash .
dr.wilson ,
thom here is mr.mercer &apos;s friend .
oh , i am -- i &apos;m sorry .
no . no , he what ? do-- donald what ?
he died , thom .
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t understand . you said he was just brain dead .
he was .
he was , and his heart was sustaining his organs .
but now his organs are no longer viable
for donation because he &apos;s gone .
donald is gone .
this is -- this is not right .
this is -- this is not fair .
i know . i know it &apos;s not fair .
it &apos;s not fair at all .
no , no .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s my best friend , since 7th grade .
i @-@ i saved his life .
i @-@ i gave him my kidney .
i was ...
i was supposed to have saved his
i just ...
okay .
all right , come on .
i know .
let &apos;s just sit down .
hey . oscar &apos;s doing well .
he needs , uh , more observation , but -- ooh .
bad leg day .
yeah , me too .
what would have happened if they hadn &apos;t found him out there ?
he &apos;d be dead .
yeah , but he &apos;s not .
he &apos;ll grow up .
he &apos;ll be , you know , who knows who .
he &apos;ll have a whole life .
do you still have dreams about it ?
usually when i &apos;m anxious .
the day , um ,
before sofia started her first day of preschool ,
i dreamt about it all night ,
about mark and lexie and the pilot
jerry .
jerry .
jerry .
for me , i dream about you screaming .
you wouldn &apos;t stop screaming .
so thank you for that .
good job today .
lucky kid .
lucky kid .
just the accident report and the worker &apos;s comp paperwork .
shouldn &apos;t take long .
you can sit in here .
dr. edwards is filling out an accident report , as well .
you two mind sharing ?
brilliant .
you know what ? i can -- i can come back .
no . it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m almost done .
okay , then .
how &apos;s your leg ?
my knee is ...
i &apos;m fine .
how about you ? how are you ?
i didn &apos;t see you coming .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
no , i know that .
i &apos;m sorry , stephanie .
will you let me say that to you , please ? okay ?
i am so sorry .
i had no idea i was gonna do that .
none .
i thought i was --
i told myself that i didn &apos;t want her ,
that april didn &apos;t want me .
and you and i ... w--
steph , you are so -- - please don &apos;t .
don &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m trying to say i didn &apos;t see it coming .
okay ? there &apos;s no way i wanted to hurt you .
and i don &apos;t know how i can make that better .
you can &apos;t .
and , anyway , we both got a day we &apos;ll never forget .
steph -- - you got a day to tell your grandkids about ,
and i got something i &apos;d never gotten before .
i got pitied .
i @-@ i was suddenly the girl who wasn &apos;t good enough
or smart enough or pretty enough or not deserving .
i &apos;ve never gotten that look before
because i &apos;m not that girl .
i know that .
look , you can hit me with as many gurneys as you want to ,
because i &apos;m gonna feel terrible about this
for the rest of my life .
okay . well , you do that if you want to . i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not going to feel sad
or angry or pitiable for one more minute ,
because i &apos;m not gonna care about you .
so , if i don &apos;t say hello
or make small talk on the elevator
or acknowledge your birthday
or even acknowledge you &apos;re alive ,
it &apos;s because , to me , you just exist .
because i don &apos;t care .
why does it feel so good to get rid of things ...
... to unload ...
to let go ?
how did it go ?
i &apos;m going to bed .
i think murphy was right .
oh , of course she was right , arizona !
i mistreated her !
and i was petty and jealous
and at my worst because you slept with her !
of course she was right !
i keep thinking we &apos;re okay .
and we -- we buy a house ,
and then this happens ,
and i &apos;m not sure we &apos;ll ever be okay .
and today i lost my research ,
i failed a patient ,
and now i have a disciplinary report
that &apos;s gonna follow me forever .
so i &apos;m going to bed !
i &apos;m sorry .
i feel like all i &apos;ve been doing is thinking about myself .
god , i swear ! i swear
i cannot listen to you apologize one more time .
you have made it very hard to keep forgiving you !
for over a year , since the plane crash ,
all i have been thinking about is myself .
i had to figure out how to ... be me .
i used to be someone who was always happy .
i woke up happy .
i was someone who used to skate at work .
and then this happened ,
and everything was hard
and everything took thought and -- and planning .
and my life felt like it didn &apos;t fit me anymore .
and i just -- i wanted --
i wanted to tear it all down and start over ,
just throw it away and find a life that fit who i am now .
but i &apos;m starting to feel like i know who i am again .
and i &apos;ve had to give up things ,
but what i &apos;ve learned is that i don &apos;t need much .
i don &apos;t need to be happy .
i don &apos;t even need two legs .
but i do know ... that i need you .
i need sofia ,
and i need you .
and i &apos;m -- i &apos;m afraid ,
now that i &apos;ve learned all of that ,
that i made you give up on me .
maybe because when we see
how little we actually need to survive ...
you shouldn &apos;t have to give up anything .
... it makes us realize how powerful we actually are .
to strip down to only what we need .
you want to know why i &apos;m upset ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
okay , why ?
she &apos;s what you wanted .
you don &apos;t just throw away a future like that .
i want you to be happy .
oh , do you ?
of course !
or do you just want to see me squared away ?
what does that mean ? !
it means , uh , you want to see me ,
you know , get what i want
so you don &apos;t have to feel guilty anymore .
about what ?
about not giving it to me .
right ?
it &apos;s either that ,
or you just want to see me get married off
so you &apos;re forced to stop thinking about me .
oh , that &apos;s it . that &apos;s the one .
to hang on only to what we can &apos;t do without .
what we need ...
not just to survive ...
yes !
... but to thrive .
calliope !
* if you fall , i will catch you *
* i will be waiting *
here we go !
