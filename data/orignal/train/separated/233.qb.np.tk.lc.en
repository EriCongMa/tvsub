you were gonna tell her you love her .
i kept trying to make it go away ,
but how do you kill a feeling ?
you &apos;re one of the good ones , you know ?
just because louis is the father of your baby
does not mean you should be with him .
you should be with me .
why ?
because i &apos;m going to love your baby
as much as i love you .
whoa . are those paparazzi ?
look at them .
oh , my god !
carol , it &apos;s me , ivy .
i &apos;m leaving tonight .
this time i &apos;m not coming back .
if &quot; gossip girl &quot; didn &apos;t exist ,
chuck and blair would not be in the hospital right now ,
fighting for their lives .
i wanna take &quot; gossip girl &quot; down for good .
i think we should use the &quot; spectator &quot; to do it .
blair is awake and responsive .
and chuck ?
louie ? what are you doing out here in the rain ?
i hadn &apos;t noticed .
i hadn &apos;t realized you and blair
had returned from europe already .
been back for three weeks . i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t know .
one of the downsides of not having &quot; gossip girl &quot; these last few months .
any information would have to come
from blair speaking to me directly , which she hasn &apos;t .
she &apos;s been busy .
i &apos;m very sorry she lost the baby .
is she all right ?
seems to be .
she spends all her hours planning the wedding .
well , i , uh , i can &apos;t very well let you get sick
before your big day . come on . i &apos;ll walk you home .
i &apos;ll be fine .
look , i know we &apos;ve had our differences .
are you really going to pass up the offer of an umbrella
on a night like this ?
thank you .
shouldn &apos;t you be at some scandalous party
the night before new year &apos;s eve ?
i haven &apos;t really been in a party mood .
well , at least you &apos;ve fully recovered from the accident .
physically .
go find dorota . have her dry you off .
thanks for letting us up while we wait for my car .
it &apos;s the least i can do after you saved me from the monsoon .
i &apos;ll go get us some towels .
louis ?
dorota &apos;s obviously become lax in announcing visitors .
there &apos;s no need to reprimand the help . louis invited me in .
i should have known you &apos;d manipulate someone .
how can you blame me ? you won &apos;t respond to my texts or calls .
i just wanted to be there for you
after the baby .
well , as you can see ,
i survived without you .
and i intend to continue that way ,
so you should go .
that &apos;s it ? i &apos;m just cut out of your life
without any explanation ?
my new york wedding is in less than a month .
i have to keep my priorities in order .
we were your priority .
what happened , blair ?
what changed after the accident ?
did it ever occur to you
that there &apos;s no such thing as an accident ?
well , it certainly felt like one when the car hit the wall .
or it was the universe &apos;s way of pointing out
what &apos;s really important .
how can you say we weren &apos;t important ?
we were the only thing that matters .
well , you &apos;re obviously not leaving , so i will .
tell louis bergdorf &apos;s stayed open late
so i can finish our registry .
i can &apos;t wait to spend the rest of my life with you .
i ...
i love you , chuck .
i love you , too , blair .
chuck ? are you all right ?
yes . thank you .
blair said to , uh , tell you she &apos;s gone
to pick out china patterns .
at this hour ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just her excuse to avoid me .
i wish that were true .
but these excursions have become quite regular .
well , is that why you were out in the rain--
looking for her ?
i just wanna know what she &apos;s doing .
have you asked serena ?
blair is not sharing anything with her .
she doesn &apos;t even let dorota accompany her .
to be honest , i thought she might be back with you .
well , as you can see , my presence only made her flee .
i &apos;m thinking of hiring a detective .
i need to know the woman i &apos;m about to marry
isn &apos;t having an affair .
well , we &apos;re both here ,
so who else can she possibly be cheating with ?
hello , daniel .
what are you doing here in brooklyn ?
in the--in the rain at night ?
i was in the neighborhood
checking in on my brooklyn holdings ,
and i wanted to make sure
you hadn &apos;t fallen into another literary slump .
yeah , i &apos;ve been holed up trying to figure out a concept
for my new book , and it &apos;s great that they gave me a deal
for a second one , but that means i @-@ i actually have to come up
with something to write about , so , uh ...
i should probably get back to failing at that .
of course .
did you know blair was back in town ?
no . i mean , i @-@ i @-@ i live in brooklyn .
without &quot; gossip girl , &quot; i know nothing .
i assume losing the baby made her realize
she loved louis after all .
he doesn &apos;t think so . he thinks blair might be having an affair .
what ? no , that &apos;s insane .
how would you know ? you said you hadn &apos;t seen her .
well , i just mean that after everything blair &apos;s been through ,
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
love doesn &apos;t make sense ,
and neither does blair &apos;s behavior right now .
louis is considering hiring a private investigator .
well , i hope you talked him out of that .
i did . i think you &apos;d make a much better choice .
chuck , i &apos;m not gonna spy on blair .
why ? you know her well enough
to know if she &apos;s hiding something .
unless there &apos;s a reason
you don &apos;t want the truth to come out .
no , that &apos;s not it . of course i do .
then i look forward to a full report .
chuck can never know the truth .
hey , happy almost new year .
i hope you &apos;re coming to the &quot; spectator &quot; party tonight .
well , after nate finally forgave me
for diminishing him to half a derek in my book ,
i &apos;m not gonna miss this chance to support him .
good , then you can help me with my year in review lists .
i need &quot; biggest transformation . &quot;
oh . um ... how about you ?
from busting ben out of prison
to being the biggest blogger in new york city ,
complete with cool new computer ?
oh , well , you can thank &quot; gossip girl &quot; disappearing for that .
people are just desperate for information ,
even if it &apos;s just about me
and my lack of new year &apos;s date .
well , i &apos;m sure that will make all the men at the party
supremely happy .
have you seen blair ? is she around ?
uh , she &apos;s not . were you supposed to meet her ?
no . no , i just heard she was back in town .
i wondered how she was doing .
well , i wish i knew . she &apos;s been keeping to herself lately .
she wouldn &apos;t even let me go with her
to vera wang for her gown fitting .
nate , hey , were you waiting downstairs ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m almost ready .
oh , good . we just need to meet the caterer .
hey , dan , glad to see ya .
you know , &quot; inside &quot; didn &apos;t make it into
our year &apos;s best book list .
i &apos;m sorry , dude .
well , it &apos;s probably best to keep it in 2011 .
it &apos;s a new year , new book .
what &apos;s this one about ?
i don &apos;t know yet , which could be
why i haven &apos;t started writing it .
you should consider , um , having it set in alaska
or maybe make it a period piece ?
i vote for anything you don &apos;t have to write
behind your friends &apos; backs .
listen , even if it &apos;s about frankenstein in the old west ,
i promise you full disclosure .
sounds like a new year &apos;s resolution to me .
let &apos;s go .
you wanna walk out with us ?
yeah , sure , i &apos;ve-- i &apos;ve got an errand to run .
i get it .
alexa chung is a better invite than your dad .
well , have fun . but not too much fun .
bye .
jenny sends her love from london .
oh , it was so nice to have her and eric home for christmas .
oh , no . not the sad empty nest face already .
no , it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s just that i hoped that charlie might surprise us
with a visit , or at least a call .
she made it pretty clear that life in the upper east side
was too much for her .
well , i can understand , with the press at her party
and the paparazzi chasing charles and blair .
but we were so close .
i just wish she had said good @-@ bye .
she didn &apos;t want to upset you after the accident .
she was a wreck , lil . she knows what she wants .
well , i would feel better hearing that from her .
every time i call carol ,
she says that charlie &apos;s just run out .
you cannot blame me for not trusting my sister
to tell me what &apos;s really going on .
and carol &apos;s crazy , but she does love her daughter .
and we both agree that pushing charlie to talk to us
would be a mistake .
i know . i just hope she &apos;s okay .
there you are .
you know how many brides i had to peek in on to find you ?
yes , it is possible to lose too much weight before the wedding .
not you , though . you look perfect .
i can &apos;t get married in this dress .
i &apos;m sorry .
all right , let &apos;s get you out of it , then .
it &apos;s beautiful , but ...
vera designed it for me before the accident ,
and now ... all i see is everything i lost .
seriously , what is the point
of making these things so tiny and complicated ?
it &apos;s too late anyway .
do you know how many months of work went into this beading ?
a bride can &apos;t just change her mind
weeks before the wedding .
yes , she can , and she can also change her mind
about marrying louis .
nice try , but i told you i &apos;m committed to him ,
and nothing &apos;s gonna change that .
is everything okay in here , blair ?
of course .
you are an artist .
but she ... needs to get married in a different dress .
i had a feeling ,
so i pulled some wonderful choices .
thank you for being so understanding .
i &apos;ll go get the dresses from the back .
now ... what did you burst in on my emotional moment
to yell at me about ?
oh , it can wait until after you find the right dress .
hello ?
remember how you asked me to call you
when blair came in for her fitting ?
she &apos;s here with a guy who &apos;s not the prince ,
and he &apos;s not a gay stylist .
let me guess-- dark , curly hair
with the pale visage of someone who doesn &apos;t get out much .
that &apos;s him .
thank you .
we need to move this stakeout to vera wang .
most surreal new york moment ?
the earthquake .
or paz de la huerta .
what &apos;s up with your e @-@ mail ?
i thought the r.s.v.p.s were going to my assistant .
ever since &quot; gossip girl &quot; went into hiding ,
people have been sending their blasts to me .
serena , there are thousands of unread messages here .
yeah , i hoped if i ignored them long enough ,
people would get the point , and i guess they haven &apos;t .
i thought you wanted gossip girl
to pay for causing chuck and blair &apos;s crash .
but the police didn &apos;t press charges .
what else can we do except settle for her silence ?
you call that silence ?
that &apos;s the sound of the entire upper east side sending you their blasts .
if you don &apos;t start posting them ,
they &apos;ll go back to gossip girl or someone worse .
my blog is about my own experience ,
not using information to hurt people .
yeah , well , the least you can do is read them .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s too simple ?
why am i even asking your opinion on fashion ?
and why are you not responding ?
what stopped your never @-@ ending soliloquy ?
you said i wasn &apos;t allowed to question
your marrying louis , so ...
oh . then you may resume your silence .
blair , we are lying to all the people we care about .
which is fine , when it &apos;s for their own good .
i &apos;m not sure that it is .
look , chuck and louis are already suspicious .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;d be better
to tell them before they find out on their own ?
how would they do that ?
the only ones who know are you , me , and god ,
and god doesn &apos;t blab .
i don &apos;t know how much longer i can keep this secret .
forever . you promised .
i don &apos;t know if i can live with those consequences .
look , i know our situation is far from ideal ,
but don &apos;t go all &quot; notebook &quot; on me , not now .
i need you .
hey , you have me . all right ?
so put weiner as worst political blunder and worst photo .
could you see who that is , please ?
it &apos;s a text . doesn &apos;t say who from .
&quot; i thought you were a journalist with integrity ? &quot;
maybe anthony weiner has your office bugged .
yeah . or someone else we did a story on isn &apos;t happy .
&quot; not important . the important thing is
that the paparazzi didn &apos;t cause blair and chuck &apos;s accident . &quot;
&quot; i did my research . do yours . &quot;
i thought i &apos;d check in , see how your sleuthing is going .
well , i &apos;ve uncovered the fact that blair &apos;s wedding dress ,
uh , fits like a glove , you know ?
i think the only person she &apos;s seeing covertly is vera wang .
anything else to report ?
no , just , uh , just shopping for some wedding stuff ,
bossy phone calls to dorota . you know , that &apos;s it .
well , if you &apos;re sure ,
the mission need not be continued .
thank you for your diligent effort .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t find any more answers .
louis , you were right about blair .
we need to talk .
hey , louis ,
any luck convincing blair to come to the party tonight ?
not yet . she &apos;s said no to every invitation
since we returned to new york .
i &apos;m afraid new year &apos;s eve will be no different .
louis , serena , it &apos;s nice to see you .
chuck , what are you doing here ?
i came to tell louis he was right .
blair is having an affair ...
with your ex .
i &apos;m referring to dan , not the myriad of men since .
what are you talking about ?
dan said he hasn &apos;t even seen blair
since she got back from europe .
he lied to you , just as he lied to me .
when he said blair was shopping for wedding trinkets ,
he was with her .
you followed them ?
after you told me not to hire a detective ?
you obviously have your own agenda where blair &apos;s concerned .
which is why ... i had my driver take a picture .
just because dan lied about seeing blair
doesn &apos;t mean that they &apos;re sleeping together .
it &apos;s a private residence .
blair has a key . what else are they doing there ?
it does explain her absences .
yeah , but that &apos;s not proof ,
which is what you guys need if you &apos;re gonna gang up
and accuse her of cheating ,
especially after everything that she &apos;s been through .
gossip girl probably has a treasure trove
of photos in her in @-@ box .
but they come to me now ,
and i &apos;m not gonna use them to destroy people &apos;s lives .
if they &apos;re innocent , it won &apos;t destroy anyone .
he &apos;s right .
what &apos;s the harm of looking through the blasts
if there &apos;s nothing to see ?
if that &apos;s how you wanna spend your new year &apos;s eve ,
go ahead . knock yourselves out .
and i hope you &apos;ll focus on getting your fiancee
to come to the party tonight .
she could really use a night out with people
who care about her .
hello ? andrew . lily just went upstairs .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m sorry . i thought this was a personal call .
i didn &apos;t realize she &apos;d asked you to look into something .
yeah , i understand that your work is confidential .
i &apos;ll let her know you called .
how about &quot; cupcake war &quot;
as the most addictive new food show ?
are those from the night of the accident ?
yeah . that anonymous texter might be right .
can &apos;t tell from these paparazzi pictures
if the photographers were even close enough
to run bhuck and blair &apos;s car into the wall .
well , what did the police say ?
the front of the car was so damaged ,
they couldn &apos;t inspect it .
the driver passed a breathalyzer ,
but i &apos;d like to talk to him myself ,
so ... why don &apos;t we invite him to the party ?
i am so excited for new year &apos;s karaoke .
will you hate me if i sing &quot; miss world &quot; again ?
andrew tyler called .
i &apos;m sorry . i ... i should have told you i hired him .
i just wanted to make sure charlie was okay .
what did he say ?
nothing .
feel good about the fact that your private detective
is discreet enough to not mention his assignment ,
even to your husband .
well , it &apos;s just as well that you know .
i hate when we have secrets ,
and this was never meant to be one .
would you mind terribly if i called him
to ask him if he found her ?
you obviously won &apos;t give this up .
andrew ? it &apos;s lily .
um , any news of charlie ?
really ?
okay . thank you , andrew .
she never left new york .
she &apos;s still here .
of course i &apos;ll think about it .
let me guess . louis wants you to go with him
to the &quot; spectator &quot; party tonight ?
with everything that &apos;s happened ,
louis feels it &apos;s important for us to have a fresh start .
but i can &apos;t .
well , you &apos;re about to be a princess .
going to social events is kind of your job description .
at international galas
with strangers speaking foreign languages .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready
to deceive the people who know me best .
oh , come on .
you &apos;re the most accomplished liar i know ,
except maybe jenny , but you trained her .
this is different .
well , maybe , but , blair ,
what is a lifetime of blackmailing authority figures
and casting out townies
if it doesn &apos;t add up to the ability
to at least feign a marginal level of happiness
at an office party ?
you know , you banished georgina to belarus .
i &apos;m sure you can down a few canapes
and watch the ball drop on nate &apos;s big screen .
fine . perhaps i am just clever enough
to pull off such a dissimulation .
just make sure you continue to never utter a word of the truth .
blair says she &apos;ll come to the party .
i &apos;ve found at least a dozen photos of her and dan .
they &apos;re obviously sneaking around together .
we both know blair will have another explanation .
how will i determine what &apos;s really the truth ?
we won &apos;t confront her without her weak link .
luckily , he &apos;ll be at the party , too .
hey , nate , place looks great , man .
you &apos;d never know how much bad news passes through here .
oh , nice to see you , too .
did you make your resolution about not lying to your friends ?
i thought i did that this afternoon .
yeah , well , our lifestyle editor says people are more likely
to stick to things they put down in writing .
so since you already know yours ...
just twist it onto the tree when you &apos;re done .
champagne ?
i think i &apos;m going to freshen up .
i wanna look perfect
for our first public appearance of 2012 .
i don &apos;t know how you can argue with this .
dan practically ran
the other way when he arrived .
and still serena has trouble believing her eyes .
i admit these do look bad ,
but they are friends . maybe they &apos;re just talking .
people don &apos;t rent secret apartments
to discuss feelings ,
and frankly , an affair with humphrey
is the one thing that explains why she &apos;s not confiding in you
and why she stopped speaking to me .
where are you going ?
to ask my best friend the truth .
if serena alerts blair ,
she could make sure dan never tells us anything either .
you have a point .
blair has a special way of controlling men ,
but you know this .
and i &apos;m sure you have an idea of how to deal with it
in this case .
they &apos;ll never be able to lie about it in front of everyone .
can i ... help you with something ?
no , thank you .
nate said i could use his office
to deal with some monegasque business .
happy new year .
when louis told me you were coming to the party ,
i didn &apos;t know that meant to hide in the bathroom
the whole time .
i &apos;m not hiding . i &apos;m primping .
they &apos;re very different .
one is done in a dark corner ,
the other with light @-@ reflecting powder .
b , what &apos;s going on ?
i feel like we &apos;ve barely talked since you &apos;ve been back .
wedding planning has been all @-@ consuming .
you &apos;ve had your wedding planned since you were 12 .
whatever it is , you can tell me .
i &apos;m sorry , blair .
but you lost the baby .
where &apos;s chuck ?
b , he lost a lot of blood ,
and he never woke up ,
so it &apos;s not looking good .
any word on a family member for that blood transfusion ?
please , god .
you have my baby .
you can &apos;t take chuck , too .
if you exist ...
let him live .
i &apos;ll do anything .
i promise i &apos;ll keep my vow to marry louis
and never be with him again .
blair waldorf ?
chuck bass is asking for you .
just because we can &apos;t be together
doesn &apos;t mean i won &apos;t love you .
that &apos;s why you cut chuck out of your life ?
b , that nurse wasn &apos;t an angel .
i know that , but ...
one minute he was dead , and then ...
i made a promise , and he was alive .
that wasn &apos;t a miracle .
that was modern medicine .
chuck is fine now .
god would understand you changed your mind .
don &apos;t you think i &apos;ve tried ?
i &apos;ve been going to church every day .
dan &apos;s been going with me ,
trying to figure out a way through this .
i went to talk to father smythe about it this afternoon .
blair , it &apos;s good to see you .
and you , dan . why don &apos;t we go into my office ?
thank you , father smythe .
having the key so i can escape at any hour
is the only thing that &apos;s kept me from losing my mind .
oh , you know , excuse me . i gotta--i gotta take this .
what &apos;s wrong , blair ?
i saw chuck last night .
that must have been difficult .
i still love him .
i @-@ it &apos;s not fair .
he &apos;s alive ,
but ... i feel dead inside without him .
if i broke off my engagement
and begged chuck to take me back ,
god would have to understand , wouldn &apos;t he ?
that &apos;s between you and god .
i &apos;ll give you a moment .
blair ? are you okay ?
now do you see ?
there &apos;s no way out of it .
if anything ever happened to chuck ,
i would feel like it was my fault .
i made a vow to marry louis ,
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
you can &apos;t base the rest of your life
on one desperate moment .
god doesn &apos;t punish people for being in love .
he wouldn &apos;t want you to marry someone
you don &apos;t wanna be with .
louis has been wonderful .
i don &apos;t not love him .
well , then you need to come clean .
he and chuck think you &apos;re having an affair with dan .
what ?
they have photos of the two of you at a townhouse ,
and they &apos;re gonna out them
unless you tell them the truth .
never . if it means keeping chuck safe ,
then i &apos;ll endure the public humiliation
of allegedly shtupping humphrey .
i &apos;ll lose everything before i lose chuck all over again .
so much for your resolution .
i thought you said you were done going behind people &apos;s backs .
my assistant stopped it before it went to the monitors .
i &apos;m sorry , nate . i couldn &apos;t think
of another way to get dan to tell the truth .
which is what ?
no , not the year &apos;s most secret affair .
look ... i wish i could tell you ,
but i @-@ i can &apos;t .
maybe we should run the year in review presentation
and have the public weigh in .
oh , come on .
that is the last thing
that blair needs right now .
i swear to you we are not having an affair .
then what the hell are you doing ?
he &apos;s having a relationship with me .
this all seems very sudden .
w @-@ well , blair was really trying to help keep our secret .
i &apos;m sorry , we should tell you guys soon .
yeah , with our history ,
we wanted to make sure that it would actually work this time
before we got our friends and family involved .
and neither of us imagined you would think
dan was with blair . i mean , that--
that &apos;s even crazier than us being back together .
it certainly is .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re not cheating with anyone ,
but , dude , you seriously need
some remedial honesty training .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m-- i really am sorry ,
and you , too , louis .
um , you and blair have been through enough .
i should go find her .
try the ladies &apos; room .
thank you .
well , blair told me about the deal she made ,
and if i can &apos;t talk her out of it ,
the least i can do is try to help her live with it .
well , now that you &apos;re my date ,
can i get you a drink ?
&apos;cause i , uh , i sure as hell need one .
rufus , what are you doing here ?
you went out for champagne over an hour ago ,
and singing karaoke by myself got a little bit humiliating ,
so i called andrew tyler .
he wouldn &apos;t tell me where charlotte was--
client confidentiality--
so i hired him to find you .
he finally broke down and told me that charlotte rhodes
is enrolled here at juilliard .
i &apos;m sorry . i just wanted to know that she &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re such a good aunt .
it &apos;s one of the reasons i love you .
now does she know you &apos;re here ?
no , and i &apos;m--i &apos;m so torn .
i don &apos;t wanna confront her
and make her feel worse than she already does ,
but i want her to know
that whatever &apos;s going on in her life ,
that we still care .
it sounds like we should ring her bell and see what happens .
let &apos;s talk to the guard .
oh , wait .
uh , charlie ?
sorry ?
uh , um , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you were charlotte rhodes .
i am , yeah . people call me &quot; lola . &quot;
and you are ?
looking for a different charlotte rhodes .
oh , it never occurred to me that there--
there might have been two of you .
i &apos;m sorry . have a happy new year .
you , too .
should we , um , go home and sing this off ?
come on .
ladies , if you &apos;ll excuse us .
i owe you an apology .
i know i promised to trust you ,
but i had a small lapse .
oh , well , none of us is perfect .
we don &apos;t even need to speak of it .
i do .
i thought you were having an affair with dan .
i &apos;m just glad serena told me the truth
before i did something i &apos;d regret .
serena told you what truth ?
that you &apos;d been protecting her new relationship with dan ,
just like he did for us
when we weren &apos;t ready for my family
to know we were dating .
of course .
although they had much more to be ashamed of than we did .
we should let the ladies get back to business .
blair , please .
after the accident , you told me you &apos;d never leave me .
now you feel further away than ever .
it &apos;s true i &apos;ve been keeping a secret .
i &apos;m converting to catholicism .
i knew how important it was for you
to be married in the church .
that &apos;s wonderful .
let &apos;s go celebrate the first year
of the rest of our lives together .
cheers !
nate ?
this is greg .
he drove chuck and blair &apos;s car the night of the accident .
look , i appreciate the invitation to the party ,
but i &apos;ve already told the police everything i know .
which is what , exactly ?
those photographers got really close to the car ,
but the bigger problem was that
my brakes felt like they had no pressure .
i swear i checked them before my shift started .
hey , listen , i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t tell you
about serena and me ,
but we didn &apos;t want our families to know ,
and you &apos;re kind of like her brother .
so are you .
well , i didn &apos;t do it to upset you .
humphrey , i don &apos;t care about you
or our blonde pseudo @-@ sibling .
your relationship with serena
may explain the sneaking around ,
but it does not make sense of the fact
blair cut me out of her life .
chuck , i swear , i don &apos;t know .
i think you do .
and when i find out what secret you &apos;ve been keeping
and why ,
you will pay .
hey , thanks for covering for me .
i know you &apos;re not keen on a dan deja vu .
well , it &apos;s a sacrifice that i can handle .
it &apos;s yours that i &apos;m worried about , though .
there you are .
serena , you better find dan .
it &apos;s bad luck not to kiss your love
at the stroke of midnight .
10 ... 9 ... 8 ...
well , i guess this is our cue .
sorry , i couldn &apos;t think of
a better way to save blair .
3 ... 2 ...
1 ! happy new year !
i &apos;ll be waiting for it . thank you .
so the car service is tracking down
all the available information .
it was blair who ordered the car .
now we just need to find out
everyone who knew she &apos;d be in it .
am i interrupting ?
i &apos;ll see what else i can track down .
thanks .
and i just wanted to say that you were right .
about the dutch being the best new restaurant in town ?
i told you . it was the sloppy duck , right ?
no , about gossip girl .
as much as i love the idea of a world without her ,
the photos of dan and blair made me realize
it &apos;s not the secrets that cause the problems .
it &apos;s the assumptions that people make about them .
so ... are you saying
what i think you &apos;re saying ?
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna go through all the e @-@ mails
and see if there &apos;s a positive way
for me to use what &apos;s in them .
you know what that means ?
you &apos;re basically the new gossip girl .
new and improved .
well , i &apos;m sorry that i spoiled our new year &apos;s celebration
by stalking innocent students .
you didn &apos;t spoil anything .
you did everything you could for charlie .
you loved her like she was your own .
but she wasn &apos;t .
maybe it &apos;s time i trust carol with her daughter .
andrew tyler found the wrong charlotte rhodes ,
and i &apos;m gonna tell him to stop looking for the right one .
in the morning , but first we celebrate with a duet
of &quot; endless love . &quot;
happy new year , lil .
happy new year .
blair , thank god .
do you know what you &apos;ve been putting me through ?
i &apos;m sorry , chuck . i ...
i @-@ i didn &apos;t come here because i changed my mind .
louis is downstairs waiting for me .
what the hell is going on ?
i just came t @-@ to ...
to tell you what a wonderful person you &apos;ve become .
and i hope you won &apos;t let this change that .
well , don &apos;t leave me .
i &apos;m not doing it to hurt you .
you sat in the car and you said you &apos;d never go .
we were going to spend the rest of our lives together ,
and now you can &apos;t even look at me .
now you ... don &apos;t even care enough to tell me why ?
i saw what was important ,
and i made the only choice i could .
if it &apos;s not an affair with humphrey ,
something else changed you . what was it ?
&apos;cause love does not just disappear .
we can never be together .
please ...
chuck , just move on and be happy .
i can &apos;t .
until i know why , i won &apos;t stop .
i will use all of the power i have to find out the truth .
some things are more powerful than even you .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t let this destroy all the good in you .
just ... because we can &apos;t be together
doesn &apos;t mean i won &apos;t love you .
just because we can &apos;t be together
doesn &apos;t mean i won &apos;t love you .
i hope chuck &apos;s gonna be okay .
well , i &apos;d be mad , too , if i was left with no explanation .
i promise i &apos;ll be more sensitive
in our breakup .
hey , why don &apos;t we , um , discuss our options
while we raid dorota &apos;s candy stash ?
we can &apos;t end our fake relationship
the night it started , anyway .
all right .
thank you for stopping by the empire with me .
i &apos;m glad you asked .
it seems we &apos;ve finally stopped keeping secrets
just in time for our wedding .
you &apos;re not getting cold feet , are you ?
no .
i &apos;ve never been more sure of any decision my entire life .
i know my i.d. is in here somewhere .
here it is .
nate , the car service invoice just came through .
what is it ?
blair got in the wrong car that night .
this says the car that crashed was the one ordered for me .
how about we help each other ?
