Oh, my god, no!
Emily.
I said, this is our last session.
It doesn't have to be good-bye.
My door is always open.
Thank you.
But, um, I--I feel good.
You know? Ready.
How are your nails?
3 days, no biting.
Are you sleeping?
I am. Uh, it's been
Two weeks, I think, since the last dream.
They may not have gone away completely.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
You never had a chance to mourn your own death, did you?
I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.
As part of protecting your identity, your team had to bury you.
They lost someone they loved.
Maybe you did, too.
Think about it.
I will.
So Houston P.D. Needs our
boots on the ground for the piano man case.
Serial rapist?
A case we consulted on about 8 months ago.
12 victims over 5 years.
He crosses racial and social lines, ages, too.
Power assertive?
Knocks them out with a date rape drug
And binds them with piano wire.
They wake up with no memory of the assault
Or how they got the permanent scar the wire leaves.
So he's branding his victims. How does he dose them?
Houston P.D. Still isn't sure,
'cause, you know, date rape drugs metabolize quickly,
And he's keeping them for 12 hours.
So why are they calling us in now?
Because of these most recent attacks.
This piece of work has elevated sick and twisted
To a whole new dimension. Cases in point--
Brittany Anderson filed a report after she woke up
Outside the restaurant she was abducted from,
And Vanessa Campbell was just reported missing.
Wait, those were victims 2 and 5, weren't they?
Yes. He's going back and attacking survivors a second time.
Vanessa was grabbed from her house?
He's changing him M.O. from what we studied.
He's upping his game.
Well, we know he stalks them.
But public venue abduction, he has the power.
Home invasion, he's on their turf.
So he's betting he can gain control
Before they get to a phone or a gun.
The question is why. What is he getting
From revisiting old victims?
It seems careless for someone who's been so controlled up to now.
What is this on the floor?
Uh, that--oh, god-- that is
The contents of Vanessa Campbell's stomach,
Which she ralphed up.
And in the glass?
According to the police report,
It is salt and water.
Homemade emetic.
E-what what?
Quick and dirty cocktail, meant to induce vomiting.
Vanessa Campbell and her husband moved to a new address.
They've put locks on the doors.
They took precautions. She even knew what to do
If she was dosed again, and it still wasn't enough.
That's what he gets out of it.
Their fear. He wants them to know that no matter what,
He can still get to them.
"We do not suffer from the shock of our trauma,
But we make out of it just what suits our purposes."
Alfred Adler.
I'm sorry. I thought you said 10:30.
I did. For you. Have a seat.
I received Dr. Merill's evaluation.
I just wanted to review it with you.
Here?
I get tired of being profiled
Through my office window.
Well, what is there to discuss?
She gave me a clean bill of health.
"Patient shows no hesitation tackling difficult goals
"As part of reintegrating into her life.
She has reached out to her mother."
I'm going to.
And has started a romantic relationship with a man named Sergio.
Now, I don't care if you lie to your therapist.
All I care about is how your behavior affects your job.
I don't think it has.
You've been overcompensating.
How have I...
You rushed to repair your relationship with Morgan.
You've become an emotional sounding board for Reid and Rossi.
That's being a good friend.
You offered me parenting advice.
Ok, so maybe I have been working a little bit harder
To regain people's trust. Is that such a bad thing?
No.
It only is if you use it
To avoid dealing with what you went through.
But I'm not.
I chose to come back here.
Why? Because I care about the people I work with?
Yes. But also because it's clean.
I know who the good guys and the bad guys are.
I don't have to worry about screwing someone over
To make a case.
Ok. I want you to make a deal with me.
You're gonna go weeks, months even, feeling fine.
And then you're gonna have a bad day.
Just let me know when you do.
And that's it?
That's it.
Deal.
Sergio?
He is the perfect man.
He doesn't hog the covers, and he poops in a box.
I just got the breakdown of Vanessa Campbell's vomit,
And there's no trace of rohypnol of ghb.
Date rape drugs are fast, but not that fast.
However he's dosing them, it's not through their stomachs.
Chief, have you been able to contact all the victims?
The ones that we could find.
Some moved. And some wouldn't take our call.
But then the press got ahold of it,
And the women started to contact us.
3 more victims admitted they'd been re-assaulted.
80% of women who are raped never report it.
Understandable they didn't want to report it a second time.
Still no DNA.
But what we do have is a partial fingerprint
From victim number one's glasses, Regina Lampert.
But we can't match it to the second assaults
Because the forensic evidence has been destroyed
Due to delayed disclosure.
That's how he's getting away with it.
He's banking on their silence.
So, then what did you do after the attack?
I changed everything about myself.
My hair color, my clothes, my apartment.
I took self-defense classes.
I'm an orange belt.
And I carry pepper spray and a whistle.
And that's why I didn't call the police.
Who's gonna buy that this happened to me twice?
We do.
Yeah, 'cause you're nice.
Nobody believes a slut who cries wolf.
We want to go back to the second attack.
It sounds like you were
trying to restore some normalcy to your life.
My husband told me that I was at the mall.
I don't remember much.
I completely blacked out.
Both times. Just...
Gone.
Diane.
Are we almost done?
Or can we at least take a smoke break?
I'm dying here.
You can't smoke in here, but there's an area outside.
Thank god.
Do you guys have a light?
Did you start smoking before the assaults or after?
Before. Why?
Yes, Vanessa smokes.
What does it matter?
It might explain how the unsub is drugging these women.
The media has done a very good job of warning people
To watch their drinks so that
bars are no longer a fertile hunting ground,
But cigarette smokers aren't as careful.
They might ask to have a cigarette from a stranger
Or have their pack swapped
out of their purse when they put it down
And then unknowingly inhale pcp or scopolamine,
Both of which mimic the effects of date rape drugs.
She hid them in her purse.
She didn't think I knew.
She cracked the windows so I wouldn't smell it when I got home.
If the unsub stalked her from the backyard,
He'd have a good view when she lit up.
He also took out the window with something like a center punch.
What's that?
It's a spring-loaded device used to punch divots into metal.
It also breaks glass.
No cigarettes. He must have taken them with him
To hide the evidence.
You know, it might not be all he's trying to hide.
Mr. Campbell, was this on when you came home?
The police told me not to touch anything.
You sure got a lot of mp-3s on here.
Was it playing one of them?
No. Why?
Well, the media center keeps a history
Of the last 20 songs played,
But it looks like somebody erased it.
It wasn't me.
Ok, I can't tell you who deleted that playback list,
But I can tell you exactly when the log was cleared.
7:43 p.m.
Why erase a history of someone else's music?
Because he didn't erase someone else's music.
At 7:36 he loaded an mp-3 via usb drive,
Played it, and promptly deleted it.
Cleared the history so he could cover up his tracks.
The unsub brought his own music to an abduction?
Yes, he did,
And that is creepy.
Fortunately, whatever is imported onto this computer
Is downloaded to the home network,
So, ladies and gentlemen, the mystery song of mr. gruesome is...
That's specific.
That's another reason to call him the piano man.
Turn it off.
Please.
Does this song mean something to you or your wife?
Vanessa hates it.
How come?
I don't know.
She doesn't know.
But every time it came on the radio, she'd burst into tears.
So the unsub just happened
to play it the night he came after her.
Can I play?
Hey, you got table 4 ready for me?
Great.
12 is generous.
Looks like somebody's making a car payment.
Not tonight, ok?
Oh, come on. Who doesn't love this song?
Me.
I don't.
Ok.
Sorry.
Songs?
I know it's kind of a strange question,
But are there any that trigger an emotional outburst?
A song that didn't bother you before the assault.
"Maybe I'm amazed."
I used to love that song.
Ok, great. Good. We done?
Not quite. Um,
Your comment about the slut who cries wolf.
It made us wonder if there
was something else you wanted to tell us.
Did you lose consciousness?
I blacked out. I--
Diana, you're safe here. Whatever it is--
I just don't remember anything.
"Lady in red," "Up where we belong," "Glory of love."
Each victim has her own piano ballad.
You know, considering the
survivors lose consciousness during the rape,
We think this functions as the unsub's signature.
He most likely plays the songs repeatedly during the assault,
Resulting in a pavlovian response
When they hear it later, sort of a subconscious rape trigger.
The night of Vanessa Campbell's abduction,
That signature became part of his torture.
Why these songs? What do they say about him?
Go ahead, Morgan?
We just found Vanessa Campbell's body.
He didn't even bother hiding it.
How long has she been dead?
Maybe 5 hours.
He's never killed before. Are we sure it's our unsub?
He used a piano wire as a garrote.
I'm not seeing my keys.
I can't find anything in this bag.
Normally the waitress has to pour me into a cab,
Not the other way around.
Oh, really?
Well, this is me.
I'm, um, I'm the suv. I'm sorry.
Listen, I know we just met.
I can't, uh, I can't let you drive like this.
Ah...drive? I'm sleeping in this bitch.
Don't be silly.
Uh, lock your doors.
A lot of--a lot of creeps out there. Ok?
Ok.
Well...good night.
Good night.
You have a cigarette?
Yes, I do.
Just, uh, don't tell my wife.
I promised her I'd quit.
Ok. Yeah.
It'll be our little secret.
Ok.
You know, I never knew why I hated that song so much.
But tonight...
You helped me figure it out.
I--I did, huh?
Yeah, you did.
That's the song you played when you raped me.
What?
I was hoping you'd come back.
Tissue inflammation is consistent
With inhalation of some sort of drug.
I can't tell what yet.
And the ligature marks?
Same as before.
New wounds on top of old scares.
No sexual assault, though. Possibly because
She regained consciousness at some point
And fought back.
She doesn't show any signs of defensive wounds.
No, but I did fish this out of her trachea.
Neoprene.
From a glove.
My best guess is she bit him.
Not enough to break the skin, unfortunately.
An exam glove?
Most likely.
Actually, it's a surgical glove.
A little bit thicker than an exam glove.
If he was wearing neoprene, it means he has an allergy to latex.
I'll have Garcia check hospital records.
What the hell?
He-help!
Somebody help me!
Hello?!
Hello?! Is there somebody there?
Do you recognize this outfit?
I wore it the night we met.
I don't remember exactly,
But friends heard me say I was going outside for a smoke.
Who are you?
You really don't remember?
No. Uh, l-last night, we met last night.
That's ok.
Because I remember you.
Pieces of you, anyway.
I guess because I was your first,
You didn't know how to drug me right,
And I kept coming to.
What are you talking about?
I remember how you were panting behind your mask,
And how your sweat
Dripped on my skin.
But most of all...
Ok, this is a misunderstanding.
I remember that song.
So first he evolves to revictimizing these women.
Then he evolves again to killing them.
The story's in the press. He knows we're hunting him.
The murders, like the gloves, are a countermeasure.
Right. He's a rapist first and foremost.
That's his primary motivation.
So then why not rape Vanessa Campbell for the second time?
He lost control when she fought back.
He couldn't risk her identifying him.
Ok, maybe that's his new primary motivation.
He wants to stay hidden.
But look at all the details we've learned about him already.
The victims could have more clues to his identity
Locked away in their subconscious.
So he kills them before we can unlock it.
Go ahead, Garcia.
Sir, I have struck out on surgeons.
In fact, none of the survivors
Saw the same two healthcare professionals
Or went to the same hospitals.
But then, I asked myself,
What would SSA Hotchner do?
And I imagined myself in a really good suit,
And I widened my search.
What did you find out?
I found an orderly whose name is Herman Scobie,
Who rotates shifts at 3 different hospitals.
The same hospitals the victims go to?
Yes, indeed they are. And according to the hospital networks,
Accessed their insurance months after the attacks.
That's how he finds the victims a second time.
We should talk to him.
Diana.
He killed Vanessa?
Yes.
He could be after any one of us now, right?
Is this because of what I played last night?
Wait, stop! No! Wait.
It's a stupid, cheesy song.
I only learned it so I could serenade my wife
When I asked her to marry me.
You can't even lie convincingly.
It's not a lie.
You sang "Total eclipse of the heart" To your wife?
It's kind of a crap song to propose to.
But it wasn't.
That--that's not what I played last night.
You're confused. Ok?
Look, I can, uh, I can prove it to you.
There are certain things that you notice
When you're a lifelong smoker.
I could tell that it tasted funny,
So I crushed it.
I guess I got enough, because I was out, but...
I wasn't out out, you know?
Because you didn't inhale as much as the other victims.
All right? Ok.
This is what I played last night.
It's the same song.
No, it's not.
Listen. Listen.
It is the same song.
It's the same. What, do you think I can't hear that?
No! No!
It's the same song!
Wait, stop.
It was--it was written by the same guy.
That's why it sounds like it's the same song.
Prove it. How do they go?
I woke up...
In his van.
He wore a mask.
I never saw his face.
But there were other things,
Things that were different from what you described.
Things he did?
Things he didn't do.
He didn't tie me up.
And there wasn't a song.
He talked to me, but there wasn't a song.
Do you remember what he said?
No.
When he was done, he bashed my head into the floor of his van.
FBI!
Out the back!
What are you doing? What is---- what is this?
Sometimes in my dreams...
I can still hear his voice.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
This one goes...
And I know
Just how to whisper
Right?
And the other one goes...
Turn around
Bright eyes
You see?
Thank you.
Why you running?
Why do you come to my house waving guns around?
Because we're looking for a rapist and a killer.
You know anyone like that?
Not me.
Morgan.
Neoprene.
That is you.
I know you're him.
You see, you didn't just play that song over and over again
When you ravaged me 5 years ago.
You sang it.
The same way you sang it right now.
That--that's your proof?
It's all I need.
You got the wrong guy. You're making a mistake.
Oh! For God's sake! It's not me!
I'm not the guy!
Yeah. It's you.
Oh, my god!
You know, according to wikipedia,
You've got 48 hours before gangrene sets in.
Less if I starve you.
So, uh...you want a sandwich or something?
What's the point?
You've already decided who I am.
Um, the point is you've ruined my life,
And I want to make you take responsibility for that.
I never did anything to you you didn't want.
What?
Do you see this?
This made my mother cry in the examination room
When the police took photos of it.
And these, here.
These made my father ask me
If I had too much to drink that night.
And...
This one.
This one was so deep that my fiance decided
That he could never touch me again.
Now, is that what you really think,
That I wanted this?
That's not what I'm talking about.
You mixed me up.
Just like you did the songs.
Where's my lawyer?
We called him.
He's on his way. I'll tell you what--
I'm gonna let him fill you in on the Piano Man investigation.
On the what?
The Piano Man.
You might have read about him.
A little.
What, you think I'm him?
No.
At least I don't.
The problem is, the way you treat some of your dates
Is a little similar to this guy.
Now, I'm not judging.
Some guys like it rough.
In fact...
Never mind.
No, go ahead.
No, I can't.
Maybe you already did.
Most of the people here
Aren't as understanding as I am.
So, between us,
Did you ever get a little too rough?
Heat of the moment?
Never.
Never?
Never.
What about those naughty girls who came back for seconds?
What about them?
They're the ones screeching the loudest.
What I need from you is a reason to kick them to the curb.
Look at the notches on their bedpost.
You think they're innocent?
That's a good one.
Besides, nobody believes a slut
Who cries wolf.
Right?
I'm gonna quote you on that.
That--that--that was just something I told myself
After the second time. How did he--
Your brain remembers details
no matter how hard you try to forget it.
It's just like the song.
It's him.
We got a positive I.D.
We'll arraign him.
We're not done. We're gonna stay and help the D.A.
Build an airtight case.
Gonna be tough if most of the victims can't identify him.
That's why we use his signature against him.
We establish a link between each of the victims and her song.
How does that work, exactly?
Are we gonna enter his song library into evidence?
If it's relevant, yes.
We'll categorize every piece of music he owns,
Every MP3, CD, old cassettes, everything.
And we establish these songs
were important to him and we go at him again.
He's lawyering up.
He raped 12 women and he killed one.
We're gonna make every charge stick.
Hello.
What?
I know.
That's--that's great.
Um, listen, can I call you back?
Ok.
...confirmed that an arrest has been made in the Piano Man case.
The suspect's name has not been released yet,
But a spokesman for the Houston Police has confirmed
He is in custody and could be arraigned as early as this evening.
What did you mean?
What did I mix up?
We've met before.
Just not the way you remember.
Evanescence. Linkin park.
And Nickelback.
So Herman Scobie's into that nu-metal goth stuff.
Yeah, and his tramp stamp probably spells out "Massengill."
This guy doesn't even have any rage against the machine.
I rock.
How old were you
When you started listening to that band?
Uh, I was probably a teenager. Why?
14 is when we start to make our own musical choices.
Our cognitive development evolves at that age
And we start to form our own cultural identity.
We stop listening to the music that our parents put on
And we start listening to the music that our friends listen to.
And those musical experiences imprint on us.
Our hormonal surges as teenagers
May make the choices seem more personal and passionate.
And later on in life we
might experiment with other musical selections,
But no music ever impacts us
as much as that which we listen to at age 14.
Herman Scobie's what, 30?
If that.
Ok, so mid- to late nineties is when he started
To take music seriously, stuff like this.
And the piano man's songs were all early eighties.
Which means the signature doesn't fit.
Herman Scobie's too young to be the Piano Man.
I used to go to this bar, the Golden Gun. You know it?
I've been to lots of bars.
This one was special.
They had a happy hour every wednesday night.
And every wednesday night I'd be there.
And every wednesday night I'd notice this woman.
Long blond hair, horn-rimmed glasses.
Every week she'd let a different guy pick her up.
It was like a deal.
She could come back but he couldn't.
You remember the bar now?
Yeah.
Yeah.
One night, she was so trashed,
I couldn't understand what she was saying.
It was "Your place."
And when we got there,
She told me...
Not to ask her about them.
That's when I saw the scars.
The next morning she was gone.
I kept my side of the bargain.
I never went back.
But I wondered about her.
Who she was.
What happened to her.
Now I see these same scars on my wrist...
And I have my answer, don't I?
You think you know me?
I know who you are, Regina.
How can Herman Scobie not be the Piano Man?
We've got the medical gloves, the medical records he pulled.
The taunt he said to Diana Mitchell he repeated to us.
Scobie definitely assaulted Diana the second time.
He's probably re-victimizing all of the survivors.
But apply the profile to Herman Scobie
And look at what's different.
There's no piano wire and there's no song played.
You think there are two unsubs, the Piano Man and a copycat?
A copycat studies the original unsub in order to learn.
Herman Scobie's a doppelganger.
He's trying to pass himself off as the Piano Man.
Why?
Convenience, maybe.
If he assaults the Piano Man's survivors,
They're less likely to reach out to the police.
And if they do, women claim it was the Piano Man.
No one thinks to look at hospital orderlies.
So who killed Vanessa Campbell,
The Piano Man or Scobie?
It's a lay-up. Same neoprene
glove in her throat as we found in scobie's van.
There's something odd about that, too, though.
If Vanessa Campbell swallowed this,
It would be scarred by digestive acids.
Even if it got caught in her trachea as he choked her out,
Gastric reflux would be evident, but there isn't any.
So the unsub placed that in her throat postmortem.
Which unsub?
He used the piano wire, he played the song,
It must have been the Piano Man.
So he plants a piece of evidence to frame Scobie.
Ok, let me get this straight.
The Piano Man is trying to convince us
That Scobie is responsible for all of these crimes.
And if these two have studied each other this closely,
Then Scobie is the key to finding the Piano Man.
His lawyer's here. Scobie's not gonna talk to us.
He will when he finds out he's been set up.
My client has nothing to say.
Good. We'd rather he listen, anyway.
You're going away for rape.
The question is whether you'll let your competition
Hang Vanessa Campbell's murder on you as well.
I didn't kill her.
I didn't even touch her. - Herman.
From what you've told us,
we know exactly what you think of these women.
You don't need to kill them.
They're not worth that much effort to you.
But the Piano Man can't take that risk.
When he'd heard what you'd done, he killed Vanessa Campbell.
He went back to an old victim,
Just like you,
But then placed a piece of neoprene down her throat.
Does that sound like an accident?
He's setting you up.
I need to discuss this with my client.
No, he talks to us now or he takes his chances with a jury.
What do you want to know?
Who is he?
I never met him.
I just read about what he did
In the hospital records.
A weird thing, though.
What?
I had two chicks picked out to do next.
I was gonna start with Vanessa, but...
He got to her first.
Who was the other one?
Regina Lampert.
Regina?
What are you doing?
Regina, I'm-- I'm begging you,
I've lost a lot of blood.
I need to go to the hospital.
Regina?
No...
Ok, guys, Regina Lampert is not answering her phone,
And I found something hinky on her,
which I'm sending to your tablets.
All right, Garcia, what are we looking at?
It's surveillance video
from the bar that Regina Lampert works at.
Do you see the guy she's talking to?
Playing the piano. He's taunting her.
She knows it, too. Look at her body language.
Watch what happens when I fast-forward to closing time.
She seems to warm up to him.
And then watch this.
Garcia, freeze it right there.
Look at her face. No, she doesn't.
She's set herself up as bait.
Credit card says that the guy at the piano
Is Hamilton Bartholomew. This is what I know--
His wife just filed a missing persons report on him this morning.
She directed me to some job he just applied for,
So I did a background check
from that where they did his fingerprints.
All right, Garcia, pull Regina Lampert's rape kit
And cross-reference the prints found and see if you get a match.
We need to get to her house.
Sending her address into your GPS.
Godspeed.
Garcia, did she pick up?
No, but we did get a 911 call from her house
And it is freaking weird.
911 operator. What's your emergency?
Hello?
My name is Hamilton Bartholomew.
I'm being held captive by a lunatic!
She took the Piano Man captive?
Unless he's not the Piano Man. I mean, think about it.
Would the Piano Man call us to rescue him?
She could be shooting at the wrong guy.
Garcia, keep trying the house.
It's the lab. They've run the fingerprints.
Hello?
FBI!
I got him! I caught him!
This is the Piano Man.
No, I'm not. This woman's crazy.
Regina, look at me.
Look at me. Drop the gun, ok?
Please don't let her kill me.
I have waited 5 years for this.
We ran the rape kit, Regina.
The fingerprint the police got off your glasses.
Do you remember? We compared it to Hamilton's.
It didn't match.
That's impossible.
That's...that's him.
That's him.
If you pull that trigger,
You're gonna kill an innocent man.
But...but...
Drop the gun.
But...
It's...
Can you walk? - Yeah. Yeah. I can walk.
I have to put these on you. Do you understand?
This is for both of our safety.
Hamilton Bartholomew,
you're under arrest for the rapes of 12 women
And the murder of vanessa campbell.
I was told that you would only give your statement to me.
Why didn't you let me pull the trigger?
Because you would be in prison.
As opposed to where I am right now?
I mean, while he gets a lawyer
And a fair trial.
He will never see the light of day, ever.
Can you guarantee that?
You know, when they talk about victims
Getting revictimized by the system,
They mean you.
I know it's hard--
No, you don't.
You have no idea what it's like...
When the monster from your nightmares comes back for you.
Wait--
Look, I'm here as a courtesy.
Something happened to you
Do you want to give me your statement or not?
What did you do to him, huh?
Did you arrest him like a good FBI agent?
Or did you kill him?
I didn't pull the trigger.
Still,
Your monster's dead.
I have to live with mine.
That's my statement.
"All the art of living lies in a fine mingling
Of letting go and holding on."
Henry Ellis.
