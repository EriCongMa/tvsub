excuse me , um ...
i know that this sounds
like a lame pickup line ,
but i know you from somewhere , don &apos;t i ?
uh , actually , it is lame
and yeah , i think ...
i think we used to date .
you and i ?
yeah .
it &apos;s crazy ,
i mean , i @-@ i ...
i juggle so many women on a regular basis that i ...
i can &apos;t keep track .
oh , right .
well , maybe this &apos;ll jog your memory .
i &apos;ve really missed you .
i missed you , too .
and i &apos;m sorry that i &apos;ve , uh ,
i &apos;ve been distant , you know .
i apologize .
oh , hey , i @-@ i get it .
i want you to know ,
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
well , i @-@ i say that you are
going somewhere , um , with me .
i &apos;ll show you .
what do you think ?
wow . nice , right ?
that &apos;s beautiful .
where is it ?
that is , uh ,
out near waimanalo .
um , a friend of a friend &apos;s place .
we got it for the weekend , so ...
this weekend ?
this weekend .
oh , danny , i &apos;ve got work .
no , no , no ,
you don &apos;t got work .
i called your boss early this morning ,
and , um , i got you covered .
so , no work and that ,
that is it for these phones .
no more phones ,
no distractions .
just you and me .
all right .
should i pack a bag
or did you do that for me ?
i didn &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t do that . but i was thinking maybe
that clothes could be optional for this weekend ,
if that &apos;s okay with you .
yeah , i think , uh ,
i think that might work .
yeah ?
yeah .
it &apos;s good to see you .
you , too .
brother , you &apos;re playing what we like to call military golf .
left , right , left , right ...
what am i doing wrong ?
well , for starters ,
you &apos;re swinging like a gorilla .
don &apos;t you remember what i said in the parking lot ?
this is a game of finesse .
the easier you swing ,
the further that little white ball goes .
okay , that doesn &apos;t make any sense to me .
see if this makes sense .
you see that little white thing
way out there in the middle of the fairway ?
yes , lou .
that &apos;s my ball .
that &apos;s swinging easy .
now , where &apos;s your ball ?
i &apos;ll tell you where your ball is--
all the way at the bottom of that little pond .
partner , partner , listen .
i &apos;m just trying to help you , okay ?
half the hpd is gonna be out here
for that charity event next week ,
watching you tee off .
is that how you want to represent five @-@ 0 ?
all right , all right .
all right , let &apos;s try it again .
hey , guys .
hi .
hi . how are you ?
good . how are you ?
good .
uh , miss wie ,
i know we &apos;re playing a little slow .
we @-@ we &apos;ll pick it up .
no , no , that &apos;s not the reason why i came over .
you guys are fine .
you guys know each other ?
please ignore my ignorant friend .
he just crawled out from under a rock this morning ,
with a driver in his hand .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
i &apos;m , um , uh ...
lou ! lou grover .
hi . nice to meet you .
i &apos;m michelle .
yeah . this non @-@ golfer here ,
that &apos;s steve mcgarrett .
hi . how are you ?
i &apos;m steve .
how you doing ?
nice to meet you .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
if you don &apos;t mind ,
i just want to give you a tip .
i just saw something from back there .
oh , i would ... yes , please .
by all means , yeah ,
especially if it &apos;s free .
his motto is ,
&quot; if it &apos;s for free , then it &apos;s for me . &quot;
please , go ahead .
i &apos;d @-@ i &apos;d appreciate it .
thank you very much .
yeah , of course .
i just saw from back there ...
okay .
maybe just want to go
a little bit more behind ,
widen your stance a little bit .
like , further away from the ball ?
yeah , a little bit . yeah .
perfect . just bend your knees .
how &apos;s that , yeah ?
yep , great .
looks great . and then , now ,
just keep your head down .
keep your eyes on the ball
and just swing through .
okay , and swing through .
what the hell ... ?
wow , see ?
you &apos;re a natural .
thank you .
of course .
thank you very much .
thank you .
you &apos;re a ,
you &apos;re a great teacher .
have you ever thought about teaching golf ?
uh , you know what ,
if my current job doesn &apos;t work out ,
then i &apos;ll think about it .
yeah , you should think about it .
yeah .
you &apos;re really good at it .
thank you .
thank you .
have a good round , guys .
all right . bye , michelle .
see you later . nice to meet you .
bye . nice to meet you , too .
what do you mean , a teacher ?
huh ? you know who that is ?
that happens to be michelle wie .
the lpga 2014 u.s. open champion .
seriously ?
yeah . seriously .
well , no wonder you were drooling , huh ?
i wasn &apos;t drooling .
i was just admiring how ...
a professional golfer like that
would take the time with a charity case like yourself .
i &apos;m sorry , are you done ?
because you see that little white ball
out there on the fairway ,
that &apos;s much closer to the hole
than your little white ball .
it looks like it &apos;s getting lonely to me .
do me a favor , answer that
so i don &apos;t have to hear any more of this .
mcgarrett .
thanks again .
see you around .
hey , what do we got ?
so , we have a confirmed arson .
two fatalities .
young couple ,
sabina and hagan mahoe .
they didn &apos;t stand a chance .
what do you mean ?
well , all the windows have security bars on them ,
but the front and back doors
were secured from the outside with a wood plank screwed to them .
so it &apos;s premeditated , then .
yeah , looks that way .
why is there nobody inside processing ?
yeah ... about that .
excuse me ...
excuse me !
i thought i made myself very clear .
nobody comes in until i give the order .
now , back the hell up ,
don &apos;t touch anything ,
and have a nice day .
i will have a nice day
as soon as you get your ass out of my crime scene .
ah , you must be mcgarrett .
i heard you didn &apos;t play well with others .
i am special agent kathy millwood , atf ,
orange county office .
okay , so you &apos;ve come a long way to trespass at my crime scene .
mm , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , commander .
this isn &apos;t some random arson .
this is the work of a serial torch .
it &apos;s the third ,
all in pearl city within the last week .
the same unsub is responsible for over two dozen
in southern california in the last five years .
what is that , a nanny cam ?
this camera was his eyes and ears .
it wasn &apos;t hardwired .
there &apos;s no memory card .
it was a live feed .
son of a bitch was watching his victims burn to death .
here you go .
aloha , my friend .
can i start you off with one of
our refreshing cold beverages ?
no , no , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;m just waiting on someone else .
hm , you &apos;ve been waiting a while .
i know because i saw you sat down about ...
30 minutes ago .
and you still haven &apos;t bought nothing .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry .
uh , i was supposed to meet my girlfriend for lunch ,
and i was late , and now she &apos;s not picking up any of my calls .
sound like you might be in the doghouse , dude .
and i hate to pile on ,
but these tables ,
paying customers only , brah .
yeah , fair enough .
fair enough .
i &apos;m sure you do a very good lunch trade .
my girl , she raves about the food .
maybe you know her ,
she &apos;s a regular here .
here .
yes , i see her come around .
yeah ?
but not today .
but if she does come by ,
who shall i say was waiting for her ?
um , john , but don &apos;t worry about it , i &apos;ll find her .
thank you , have a nice day .
danny &apos;s amber ?
you sure about that ?
he had a picture with them together .
they looked pretty cozy , brah .
you think she &apos;s stepping out on danny ?
i don &apos;t know i &apos;ll look into it .
did you get a last name ?
no , but i took a picture of the
perp &apos;s ride as he drove away .
the perp ? now he &apos;s the perp ?
hey , that &apos;s my professional opinion , partner .
picture &apos;s on its way .
if you need any more assistance ,
you know where to reach me .
okay , this is where the accelerant was poured .
it extended around the entire room
and then across into the center ,
where the fire started .
it &apos;s not gasoline .
no , it &apos;s liquid petroleum .
it &apos;s used in camping stoves .
fire bugs call it white gas .
the fumes are less volatile than gasoline ,
making it less likely that our torch
would injure himself when setting the fire .
this guy really knew his stuff .
you have no idea .
your first fire was five days ago .
vacant house a few blocks away .
second fire , two days ago .
family was away on vacation .
now , hpd arson guys uploaded these cases
onto the national taps database ;
i linked them to the fires in california .
all right , so the pour pattern
and the use of white gas
is this guy &apos;s signature .
yeah .
camera part of the signature , too ?
no . that &apos;s something new .
and when he started in california ,
he went for vacant homes ,
abandoned buildings .
but then , as time went on ,
he evolved .
the last three arsons in my county
were similar to this one--
a single @-@ story home ,
bars on the windows ,
doors secured from the outside ,
victims trapped on the inside .
so we &apos;re looking for someone
who recently moved to oahu ?
not necessarily .
the torch we &apos;re looking for
was active in california for about three years .
then , two years ago ,
the fires suddenly stopped .
now he shows up here .
any idea why he took a break ?
maybe he got locked up for something else .
i don &apos;t think so .
this guy is too good ,
too careful .
any number of triggers
could have made him stop and start again .
but now that he &apos;s taken lives
and gotten away with it ,
he &apos;s not gonna stop again
until he decides to move on .
what else can you tell us about him ?
the torch we &apos;re looking for
is someone who &apos;s able to function normally in society .
on the surface , there &apos;s nothing remarkable about him .
he &apos;s disarming , personable ,
may even be charming .
hi .
hi .
i &apos;m a licensed exterminator .
i &apos;m doing a job up the street .
it &apos;s been a really bad year with all the rain ,
especially for older homes like yours .
since i was in the neighborhood ,
i thought i &apos;d offer folks a free ,
no @-@ obligation inspection .
he &apos;s persistent and persuasive .
well , even if you don &apos;t see them ,
they can be there .
get ahead of it now ,
you save yourself a ton of money in the future .
like i said , it &apos;s free .
all right ...
he targets victims
who are young and attractive ,
whose lifestyle and happiness he envies .
he then manages to ingratiate himself somehow ...
gets inside their homes ,
studies the layout ...
awesome .
thank you .
thank you so much .
you have yourself a great day .
this interaction with his victims
is the final step to determining if they will die .
well , you were right .
my being right didn &apos;t save these people .
i get a feeling this is more than just a collar for you .
looks like our guy escaped
through a trapdoor in the laundry room ,
that led to a crawlspace under the house .
this guy knew this place inside and out .
we need to canvass the whole area ,
see if anyone saw anything .
yeah , hpd &apos;s on it ,
and we got csu searching for a camera .
he didn &apos;t use one this time .
what is that ?
a fire retardant gel--
it &apos;s sprayed on the outside of homes
that are in the pathway of an oncoming brushfire .
he stood right here .
help !
he wanted to be in the room ...
when these people were dying .
good morning .
somebody had a rough night last night .
come here .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . i was , uh ...
sorry if i woke you up . i was just , um ...
couldn &apos;t sleep , kept walking around .
i came out here , it was like 3 in the morning
and i fell asleep out here .
who &apos;s reyes ?
you @-@ you mentioned his name
in your sleep last night .
i did ?
yeah .
marco reyes . he &apos;s , uh ...
he &apos;s the guy that killed my brother .
oh , danny , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t ...
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s all right .
what ... what happened to him ?
let &apos;s go swimming .
you want to go swimming ?
you hate the water .
i don &apos;t know if i hate the water .
but i was just thinking ,
if you were wearing something skimpy ,
maybe it would be a ... more pleasurable experience , you know ?
i &apos;m happy to oblige .
all right , let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go .
okay .
wait , come back .
let &apos;s not go yet .
okay .
chin . hey , what &apos;s up ?
so that plate that kamekona gave you
came back to a car
rented by a frank simpson ,
out of new york city .
弗兰克 · 辛普森
tsa has him landing here a week ago .
well , amber &apos;s from new york city .
maybe , uh ...
maybe this guy &apos;s an old boyfriend or something .
he &apos;s more than an old boyfriend .
he &apos;s her husband .
turns out our amber vitale
was actually born melissa armstrong .
梅丽莎 · 阿姆斯特朗
her married name is melissa simpson .
she travels 5,000 miles ,
she changes her name ,
and now the husband shows up ?
she had to have been running from him .
yeah , and for good reason .
nypd arrested simpson back in 2013 for felony assault .
amber , aka melissa simpson ,
was the complainant victim .
he nearly killed her .
she &apos;s got an order of protection against him .
yeah , all right . well , you and i both know
that thing &apos;s not worth the paper it &apos;s written on .
all right ? i bet amber knew that , too .
yeah . i tried calling danny ... and amber , as well .
both phones went straight to voice mail .
danny told me that he was going off the grid .
he wants to spend some time with amber .
they must have turned their phones off .
well , that explains why i can &apos;t ping their location .
he say where he was taking her ?
no . no , he didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll reach out to friends
and work and see if anyone knows anything .
have hpd help put an apb out on simpson .
if he &apos;s going after amber ...
she and danny could be in danger .
what is it ?
ball cap .
everyone &apos;s looking at the house . he &apos;s looking at us .
that &apos;s him .
steve !
damn it .
he was just here .
you ! green jacket .
show me your hands !
right now ! put &apos; em on your head !
turn around , slowly .
that &apos;s not him .
are you agent kathy millwood ?
how do you know my name ?
don &apos;t do that ! do not do that !
get your hands back on top of your head !
what &apos;s the matter with you ? get on your knees .
your hands . give me your hands !
what did he tell you ?
nothing .
he gave me $ 100 to put on this hat and coat
and he told me to make sure you got that envelope .
that &apos;s it .
what are those ?
i said , what are those ?
the torch knows you ?
what are you not telling us ?
what are you not telling us ?
the man we &apos;re chasing ...
he burned down my house
and he killed my husband .
what ?
so how are you still on this case ?
i &apos;m not .
the arsonist &apos;s desire to destroy and kill
is born out of a chronic sexual dysfunction
fueled by feelings of anger ,
inadequacy and shame .
his iq is well below the normal range .
fire makes him feel powerful
and in control ...
but these feelings only temporarily mask
the pain of knowing who he really is :
a weak , frightened coward .
you wanted to antagonize him
so he &apos;d contact you , right ?
yes .
and he did .
two nights later ,
he broke into my house
and set the fire that took my husband &apos;s life .
mitch and i had gotten into a horrible fight
that night and , um ...
he accused me of being obsessed with the case
at the expense of our marriage .
he wasn &apos;t wrong .
he ended up sleeping on the couch in our guest room .
mitchell ? mitch !
about 4 : 00 a.m , the alarm went off , and ...
mitch !
by the time i got to him , it was too late .
mitch ?
come on , baby .
coroner said he had already passed from smoke inhalation .
so how did you get out ?
firemen dragged me out .
i didn &apos;t want to leave mitch in there .
you know , kathy , i &apos;m ...
i am sorry , i really am .
but you lied to us .
this isn &apos;t a job for you anymore ,
you got to see that .
the only reason you &apos;re here is to take this guy out
and avenge your husband &apos;s death .
no .
i want to stop him .
for what he did to my husband
and for killing all those other people .
and if the atf thinks that &apos;s a conflict of interest ,
well , then that &apos;s too damn bad
because i &apos;m the only one who &apos;s gotten this close .
yes , i blame myself for what happened to my husband ...
but , damn it ...
tracking this guy down
is the only thing that gives me purpose .
please ...
please don &apos;t take that away from me .
all right .
my boys spoke to one of amber &apos;s coworkers .
he said that their boss might know where amber and danny are .
he also said that an old friend of hers
came by the office this morning ,
asking the same question .
we &apos;re trying to track down the boss .
as soon as that information comes in ,
i &apos;ll get it to you .
all right , well , let &apos;s make it fast , duke .
obviously we &apos;re not the only one looking for &apos; em .
babe ...
whatever you &apos;re cooking smells really good .
hey , so i just got off the phone with the lab .
turns out the gel that you guys recovered
from the last scene
only comes in a powdered form .
it has to be mixed with water to create the gel .
well , fong found a chemical , cypermethrin ,
mixed in with the recovered sample .
it &apos;s a pesticide used to kill termites .
so wait a minute , the gel was mixed in a container
that once held the pesticide ?
yeah . and cypermethrin is legal for use
only by licensed exterminators .
wait , so our torch is an exterminator .
i &apos;m sorry .
anybody else see the irony in that ?
that &apos;s how he got into their homes ,
got to know who the victims were .
yeah , so we cross @-@ referenced names on purchase orders
with the names of all the exterminators on the island .
and we got a hit .
that &apos;s him .
杰森 · 迪克莱尔
jason duclair , five @-@ o !
clear .
clear .
well , i guess we found the arson wing of the museum .
guy &apos;s proud of his work .
these red pins must be the homes he &apos;s already torched .
and the yellow ones must be the potential targets .
okay , i &apos;ll get hpd dispatch to these addresses .
hold on .
i got an e @-@ mail here ,
it &apos;s a reservation for a hotel room tonight
at the lava gardens ,
room number 2104 .
well , that ... that &apos;s just three miles down the road .
why would he need a room there ?
because he &apos;s gonna go for something big this time .
that hotel &apos;s his next target .
hey , how you doing ?
enjoy your stay .
thanks .
do you love him ?
answer me !
do you love him ? !
frank , please ...
all i wanted to do was take care of you .
to love you !
love me ?
you put me in the hospital twice , frank .
oh , i know ...
i know i did , baby .
i made a mistake .
i told you i was sorry about that .
put the knife down .
put the knife down , frank , please .
i want to .
but i can &apos;t .
i need you to tell me that you still love me .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t ... anymore .
i can &apos;t ... - why not ?
why not ? because of him ?
you &apos;re gonna tell me that you love him ?
because i didn &apos;t fly 5,000 miles
for you to tell me that it &apos;s over !
danny !
danny !
danny !
danny , stop !
i &apos;m gonna get you to the hospital .
i got you .
keep pressure on it .
i &apos;m gonna get you to the hospital , okay ?
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
you can &apos;t run from me !
all right , kathy ...
you stay down here , all right ?
coordinate the evac with hpd and fire .
okay . be careful .
yeah . let &apos;s move .
clear .
clear .
where the hell is he ?
well , the front desk said he definitely checked in to this room .
well , something &apos;s off .
hi . this is kathy .
leave a message .
kathy &apos;s not answering .
there &apos;s got to be another room .
i know there &apos;s a part of you that &apos;s afraid .
part of you that just wants this all to end .
yeah , that &apos;s why you stopped
and went away after you tried to kill me the first time .
isn &apos;t that right , jason ?
jason !
hi . this is kathy .
nothing .
she &apos;s still not answering her phone .
hpd and fire haven &apos;t seen her .
guys , look at this .
it &apos;s blood and it &apos;s fresh .
well , that other room theory &apos;s
looking pretty good .
all right , we need to check every floor .
nothing .
next .
come on , come on .
next .
呼叫按钮
there &apos;s our matching blood trail .
the police know who you are .
they &apos;re here .
you &apos;re never gonna get away .
don &apos;t you see ,
agent millwood ?
i never planned to leave .
i &apos;m right where i want to be .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
no , i do .
we have to finish what we started .
you &apos;ve already killed my husband .
there &apos;s nothing more painful than that .
do you hear me , jason ?
jason ?
you have no idea how close
you were to catching me , agent millwood .
we could &apos;ve been famous together .
but then you went on tv and
told those lies about me .
i told the truth .
you called me an uneducated deviant .
and look now .
here you are , at my mercy .
who &apos;s the smart one now ?
oh , god !
oh , god ...
before we die ,
i want you to know
i have no remorse
for what i &apos;m doing .
burning people and things
is the only real pleasure i found on this earth .
i can only pray that death
is no worse than this life .
oh , my god !
i got him !
grover , now !
thank you .
all right , i got him .
you clear ?
on your back , on your back .
on your back .
wait , look at me .
look at me , you son of a bitch !
i promise you
you &apos;ll get exactly what you want someday . you will burn in hell .
let &apos;s go .
all right , hold her .
mcgarrett .
what ?
when ?
how bad is it ?
i &apos;m so sorry , i &apos;m so sorry .
i should &apos;ve told him .
he &apos;s in recovery .
it may take a little time ,
but he &apos;s gonna be okay .
he &apos;s gonna be all right ?
he &apos;s gonna be all right .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome ...
thank you so much .
take good care of her .
all right .
i didn &apos;t have much of a family as a kid .
and when i was 19,
i met frank .
and he was older
and charming and ...
he was the first man
who ever made me feel special .
a year later ,
we were married ,
and everything changed .
he wanted to control every aspect of my life .
and when i stood up for myself ,
he got violent .
one night , he , uh ,
he almost killed me ,
so i @-@ i ...
left the city and ran as fast
and far away as i could .
and then i met you .
i got lucky , huh ?
right , babe ?
i wouldn &apos;t call it lucky .
no ?
no . i @-@ i mean ,
i was , i was afraid
you would think i was damaged goods ,
that you wouldn &apos;t want me with all that baggage .
baggage ?
look , i got , um , i got plenty of baggage
my @-@ my @-@ myself , you know ?
i think between the two of us , we may be able , be able
to open up a luggage joint one day , you know ?
yeah .
look , um ... i say that @-@ that ...
that part of your life is over with now .
you know , it &apos;s finished .
i mean , we ... we can start over right now .
what do you say ?
all right ?
yeah .
yeah ? are we good ?
i &apos;m ... melissa armstrong .
melissa armstrong ?
melissa armstrong , i &apos;m , uh ,
danny williams , nice to meet you .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
i &apos;m so happy that
your partner &apos;s gonna be okay .
thank you .
no , thank you .
so what do you plan to do with yourself
now that duclair &apos;s crossed off the list ?
walk away , retire ,
start over .
try to let go of all that guilt .
you know , i spent the last two years
of my life just existing .
i think it &apos;s time to start living again .
you know ...
don &apos;t look back , okay ?
just don &apos;t look back , whatever you do .
you can &apos;t change the past .
trust me on that .
all right ?
you saved my life . you get a hug , okay ?
thank you .
take care of yourself .
i will .
you do the same , okay ?
i will .
bye .
bye .
hey , boss , can i bum a smoke ?
move .
just kidding .
three .
all right , all right ...
grab that putter for me , little girl .
thank you .
so , dad ,
how was my driving ?
little mama , your driving has been outstanding ,
although not quite as good as my driving .
off the tee , that is .
hey , don &apos;t hurt your shoulder
patting yourself on the back , okay ?
is he always like that ?
only when my mom is not around .
let &apos;s leave your mother out of this .
okay , well , daddy , i don &apos;t understand .
how can you have 20 less strokes
than uncle steve and still be tied ?
because despite uncle steve having
an lpga major @-@ winning golf professional
as a caddy ,
he still has a very large handicap ...
in more ways than one .
it &apos;s easy putting .
hey , buddy !
yo , if you ever play golf again ,
which you shouldn &apos;t ,
the idea is to get the ball
close to this little ,
uh , pin thing .
that &apos;s my partner .
yeah , that &apos;s very funny ; well done .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be at home resting .
yeah , the @-@ the doctor thought
it would be a good idea
for me to come out ,
get some fresh air ,
and watch you humiliate yourself
on the golfing course here .
if these are your friends ,
i would hate to meet your enemies .
yeah , tell me about it .
okay , i know it doesn &apos;t look like it ,
but it &apos;s a very , very makeable putt .
you got this .
i got this ?
you got this .
excuse me .
what ?
listen , i didn &apos;t want to shout this out
and embarrass you in front of all these folks ,
but , uh , would you mind
if i just make this little short putt to win it
before you miss yours ?
knock yourself out .
all right .
here we go .
excuse me again .
i thought you said
it broke away from the water ?
what do you want ?
oh , hey , buddy .
listen , uh , from way back here
it was hard for us to tell ,
but did that go in ?
all right .
this is it .
last hole , last putt .
you make this , you win .
no pressure , right ?
no , no pressure .
you got this .
any time you &apos;re ready , tiger .
i got this .
okay , just visualize the ball
falling into the cup .
yes , just visualize the trophy
falling into my hands .
don &apos;t listen to him ,
just @-@ just focus .
you got this . just focus .
falling into the cup .
no ...
oh , hell , no !
