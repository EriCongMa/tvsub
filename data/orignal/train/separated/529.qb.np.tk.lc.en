a badge and a gun
今晚一起吃饭吧 我们谈谈
you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m ok .
no , you &apos;re not .
ah , it &apos;s savannah .
she wants to meet for dinner tonight
because we need to talk .
oh , ma &apos;don .
yeah , trust me .
i &apos;ve gotten this text enough times in the past
to know it ain &apos;t good .
hey , look . all i know is savannah is a wonderful woman
and you two love each other .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
yeah ?
no . you &apos;re probably completely screwed ,
but good luck anyway .
good luck with what ?
nothing . nothing .
savannah says they need to talk .
ok , you know what ? both of you , thank you .
you guys are so helpful .
ok , ok . here &apos;s me being helpful .
uh , the good news is that your &quot; we need to talk &quot; talk
with your fabulous lady love is gonna have to wait , but ...
let me guess . the bad news is we got ourselves a case .
yeah , and it &apos;s real bad . so , saddle up , cowboys ,
&apos;cause hotch says you need to get leaving asap .
so , you have a little reprieve for now ,
but take it from me , short of faking a heart attack ,
there &apos;s no way to avoid the inevitable .
los angeles , here we come again .
earlier this morning , isabella jayne was found
in her home in atwater village .
this comes on the heels of gertrude smiles being discovered
in her house in eagle rock 5 miles away .
both women had been wrapped up and left in their bedrooms ,
gertrude in a rug , isabella in her own sheets .
prelim m.e. report says that both victims died of asphyxiation .
were there any other signs of physical trauma ?
none .
so suffocating them gets him off .
we &apos;ve seen erotic asphyxiation before , but this is different .
i mean , he &apos;s completely encapsulating these women .
it sounds like remorse . maybe the unsub knew his victims .
both of them are single .
it &apos;s possible he &apos;s romantically involved with them .
or they &apos;re surrogates for someone
he feels guilty about killing .
whatever the reason , there &apos;s something about wrapping them .
that &apos;s important to him .
there &apos;s no sign of burglary of forced entry .
somehow he &apos;s talking his way in .
so they knew him or he used a ruse .
baby girl , any connection jump up ?
nothing yet , but i &apos;m still digging .
my gut says ruse . charm and harm .
he smooth talks women to gain their trust ,
and then when they let down their guard ,
he turns on them .
well , two victims in two days .
whatever he &apos;s doing works .
it could turn into a spree . wheels up in 30 .
yes ?
good morning , ma &apos;am . sorry to bother you ,
but we &apos;re investigating an incident in the neighborhood .
i &apos;m not sure if you &apos;re aware ,
but there was a home invasion yesterday about a block over .
oh , my gosh , is everyone ok ?
well , unfortunately , a woman was killed .
we &apos;re hoping with the cooperation of the community ,
we can get him before he strikes again .
of course .
do you have a few minutes to answer some questions ?
i &apos;m not even sure how i can help .
well , ma &apos;am , it &apos;s possible that you saw something ,
you don &apos;t realize its significance .
but if now &apos;s not a good time ...
it &apos;s fine .
please come in .
you &apos;re not allergic to cats , are you ?
no .
i have two .
they &apos;re somewhere around here .
a single woman with cats . i sound like a cliche .
no , not at all .
please have a seat .
can i get your name ?
patricia brannon .
b @-@ r @-@ a @-@ n @-@ n @-@ o @-@ n .
ms. brannon , over the last few days ,
have you noticed anyone in the neighborhood
who looked , uh , like he didn &apos;t belong ?
not that i recall .
maybe a suspicious looking vehicle parked on the street ?
now that you mention it ,
there was a van parked down the block for the longest time .
could that be something ?
did you see a name on the van ?
all @-@ city cable .
i &apos;m sorry , could i get you something ?
water , coffee , lemonade ?
yeah , yeah , water would be great .
sure .
&quot; the darkness always lies . &quot;
anthony liccione .
well , it doesn &apos;t appear the unsub has a particular type .
gertrude was 29 and blond .
isabella was 40 and brunette .
and garcia found no personal connection between the victims .
both led low @-@ risk lifestyles .
isabella worked from home doing medical billing .
gertrude was a marketing exec for a toy company .
both victims were also home alone
during the day when they let him in .
rather than type , it may have been the women &apos;s circumstances
that were important to him .
you know , the wrapping of the victims
and the fact that they were both found in the bedroom
could indicate some sort of sexual or power dominance fetish ,
like claustrophilia .
but don &apos;t most claustrophiliacs
want to experience it for themselves ?
well , if the unsub was into that ,
he could be projecting his own fetish onto his victims .
sir , the l.a. division just reached out .
there &apos;s been another woman found dead ,
wrapped head to toe in a bedsheet , this time in her kitchen .
3 victims in two days .
as predicted , we officially have a spree killer on our hands .
and officially the lapd has handed over the investigation .
the motivation for spree
killers is typically personal and retaliatory
with an ultimate goal in mind .
christopher dorner &apos;s motivation was payback
for being fired by the lapd .
he set out to murder cops and their families .
he killed a police officer and a sheriff &apos;s deputy ,
after killing two family members of another cop .
so what &apos;s driving our unsub ?
and why now ?
the answer &apos;s in his behavior .
garcia , let agent colfax know we &apos;re on the way .
yes , sir .
dave , when we land , you and morgan
go to the latest crime scene .
reid , you go the the m.e. ,
and jj and i will get set up at the field office .
aaron hotchner .
natalie .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be back here so soon .
neither did we . this is agent jareau .
hey . welcome .
what do we know about the latest victim ?
patricia brannon .
48 . lived alone in silverlake .
she worked nights at an animal hospital as a veterinary tech .
who found her ?
super in her apartment complex .
came by to fix a leak .
the first two victims lived in private homes .
yeah , it &apos;s a bold move to kill in an apartment complex .
easier to be seen or heard by neighbors .
he &apos;ll keep taking greater risks .
he needs to surpass the rush of the last kill .
i had my people pull the criminal records
of men in l.a. with mos involving bondage .
any potential candidates who could be our unsub ?
yeah . 3 had relevant priors .
and where are they ?
i picked up two of them but had to let them go .
alibis checked out .
and the third ?
william snyder . history of b &amp; e and sexual violence against women .
he &apos;s still in the wind .
so how did he know which apartment to go to ?
he must follow them . their parking spaces
and mailboxes may be marked .
well , there &apos;s no security guards to announce visitors .
the buzzer panels has names and apartment numbers on it .
well , let &apos;s just hope those work .
he could have just pushed all the buttons ,
hope somebody let him in .
or ...
he just walked right in .
thanks again , ma &apos;am , for your time .
of course .
well , this complex is pretty small .
and all the front doors face the courtyard ,
yet nobody heard or saw anything
when patricia brannon was killed .
it means he &apos;s organized , criminally sophisticated ,
no amateur . he gets in and out without detection .
we should send the camera footage
back to the office so hotch can review it .
hey , this might be our lucky day .
when we unwrapped the victim
i noted obvious signs of asphyxia .
petechial hemorrhage , cyanosis in the nail beds .
pretty clear that &apos;s the c.o.d.
mm @-@ hmm . she was wrapped in this ?
look , bite marks .
she attempted to chew through the material to get some air ,
which means she was wrapped premortem .
yes , like the other victims .
there was also a tear in the upper frenulum .
the skin around her nose and mouth appears white ,
so he must have pressed down with his hand to smother her .
any sign of sexual assault ?
none . same as the first two .
so , smothering is either his m.o. or his ritual .
what kind of ritual ?
right now only he knows .
hey . did you track down that sex offender william snyder yet ?
yeah , it &apos;s a dead end .
how so ?
highway patrol locked him up 48 hours ago for dui .
case just hit the system .
the security footage on
patricia brannon &apos;s apartment complex is up .
that must be him .
he &apos;s dressed like a professional .
we put a height scale overlay on the image ,
but because of the angle , it &apos;s not exact .
he &apos;s between 5 &apos; 7&apos; and 5 &apos; 10 &apos; ,
weighs around 160 .
it &apos;s clear he knew where all the security cameras were .
he &apos;s covering the left side of his neck .
maybe he &apos;s hiding a scar or injury ?
he looks confident , like he belongs there .
he &apos;s hiding in plain sight .
this confirms he uses a ruse .
yeah , but we don &apos;t know what it is yet .
you see that ? her demeanor changed .
she &apos;s deferring to him like he &apos;s a cop .
that &apos;s why she didn &apos;t hesitate to let him in .
can you back that up , please ?
ok .
right there , he reaches in his jacket .
can you blow that up ?
sure .
he &apos;s showing her credentials .
the lapd detectives are incredibly proud of their badges .
they wear them clipped to their belt or jacket or on a chain .
they don &apos;t carry creds .
no . but we do .
can i help you ?
morning , ma &apos;am .
fbi .
what if he &apos;s one of us ?
let &apos;s have rossi meet us in the scif .
if we all leave now , they &apos;ll notice .
i &apos;ll stay here and see if anyone &apos;s behavior changes .
您正在进入敏感信息隔离设施
if he is one of our own , i will take personal pleasure
in bringing the son of a bitch down .
we have 945 active agents in this division .
how many are men ?
766 .
we &apos;ll need personnel files on all of them .
now , if he is fbi ,
would he really want to hunt in his own backyard ?
headquarters tracks every fbi agent 24 / 7 / 365,
whether they &apos;re working of off duty .
garcia , we need you to track all the cell phones
for all the male agents in the bureau over the past week .
wow . that is a lot of testosterone .
ok . there are 13,421 special agents .
around 11,000 of those are male .
why are you asking ?
oh , come on , really ? the good guys are supposed to be good .
ok , cross @-@ check the locations of those male agents
against our crime scene coordinates .
cross @-@ checking as we speak ,
and not so secretly hoping i do not get a match .
if he does work in this office ,
he knows you &apos;re here and maybe onto him .
he &apos;s going to accelerate .
i &apos;ve got this , jj .
why don &apos;t you assist morgan and reid .
you have those l.a. files ?
yeah , coming up .
our physical search parameters are too broad .
we &apos;ve only eliminated a quarter of the l.a. division .
anyone under disciplinary review ?
5 . two for duis ,
two for misuse of bureau property .
one for sexual harassment .
sexual harassment . which one ?
mike pelman . last month a co @-@ worker
accused him of making unwanted advances .
go ahead garcia .
sir , no fbi credentials have been reported missing or stolen ,
and i checked all cell phone locations of male agents ,
including those who traveled to los angeles
either on assignment or for personal reasons .
anyone near the crime scenes ?
yes . there are 3 agents in the l.a. division
whose cell phones pinged near two of the sites .
was one mike pelman ?
mike pelman . i remember there was a mike--
no . mike belmont , dennis giza , and marcus levi .
i can rule out belmont . he &apos;s a stand @-@ out agent ,
plus he &apos;s african @-@ american .
that leaves agents giza and levi .
yes , but levi &apos;s cell phone
pinged at the first and second crime scenes ,
and giza &apos;s pinged at the first and third .
thanks .
they only overlap on the first .
could they have been working as a team ?
they &apos;re both in long beach right now .
been there all morning working on a smuggling case .
we need to interview them . can you call them in ?
colfax .
another victim &apos;s been found .
atwater village . she was killed within the last hour .
the unsub has limited his kill zone to this area .
now , knowing l.a. traffic ,
it would take either giza or levi
3 hours to go from long beach to atwater
and back .
it &apos;s not them .
i wasn &apos;t even gone for 3 hours .
how could this happen ?
i &apos;m sorry for your loss . if you need some time ...
no . i want to get the bastard who did this to mary .
can you try to tell us
everything you remember about this morning ?
it was 8 : 30 .
and i was late , so ...
i ran out the door .
i didn &apos;t even say goodbye to her .
and when did you come back ?
around 11 : 00 .
i had a post @-@ production meeting and forgot my external drive .
so no one knew you &apos;d be coming home this early ?
i--i come and go all day .
i mean , i could have been here .
i should have ...
unlike the other victims , mary lenahan was married .
the unsub took a serious risk targeting her .
yeah , spree killers lose their focus over time .
they get caught up in the thrill of going from kill to kill
and become less organized .
well , she &apos;s the neighbor from across the courtyard .
she didn &apos;t see or hear anything .
nobody else seems to be answering their door .
wait a minute . looks like somebody &apos;s being a little shy .
ma &apos;am , we &apos;re with the fbi .
we need to talk to you about something important .
we know you &apos;re home .
i &apos;m agent jareau . these are my colleagues .
and you are ?
susan groves .
i have a bad heart and i don &apos;t want to get involved .
we understand . we &apos;ll be quick .
did you happen to see anyone enter or exit
the lenahan apartment this morning ?
i heard a noise , so i looked out the peephole .
i saw a man come out around 10 : 30 .
can you describe him ?
he was a handsome fellow , all dressed up in a suit .
have you ever seen him before ?
no . but ...
but what ?
i think mary might have been cheating on brian .
what makes you say that ?
as the man was leaving , i saw him buttoning up his shirt ,
straightening his tie like he was getting re @-@ dressed .
is there anything else that you noticed about him ?
well , he didn &apos;t seem to
be the kind of man to have a scary tattoo .
tattoo ? can you describe it ?
it was a spider web , right here .
i saw it just before he buttoned his collar .
the whereabouts of every
male agent in the bureau have been verified .
and the prison tat on the unsub &apos;s neck
confirms that he isn &apos;t one of us .
he &apos;s criminally sophisticated because he &apos;s done serious time .
but somehow he figured out how to copy us ,
how we show our creds , how we talk to civilians .
it &apos;s time to deliver the profile .
we believe we &apos;re looking for a white male in his early 40s
who &apos;s posing as one of us .
he &apos;s using fake or stolen fbi credentials as a ruse
to gain entry into the homes of vulnerable women .
the cobweb tattoo on his neck symbolizes a very long prison term ,
most likely for violent crimes .
that &apos;s where he picked up his criminal sophistication .
now , he was probably forced to develop his verbal skills
just to survive on the inside .
this means he &apos;s articulate ,
socially adept , and appears non @-@ threatening .
these are some of the same qualities
that made ted bundy such an effective predator .
like ted bundy , the unsub
most likely has anti @-@ social personality disorder
and may also suffer from claustrophilia .
what &apos;s that ?
an extreme form of bondage . sexual arousal
is connected to the anxiety of feeling confined ,
usually by total encasement in tight spaces .
it &apos;s typically practiced by consenting partners ,
but the unsub &apos;s anti @-@ social nature
turned it into his method of killing .
it &apos;s possible he suffered from claustrophilia while in prison
and is now revisiting that trauma onto his victims .
or it happened before prison--
an event in his teenage years
antagonized his already latent deviance .
this guy gets off on the power
of impersonating law enforcement
and the respect and access credentials command .
this affirmation seeking behavior is what motivates him .
it means he &apos;s driven by more than wanting to hear yes .
he needs his victims to let their guard down ,
allow him into their homes , cooperate .
the ruse gives him that .
how &apos;s he choosing his victims ?
well , his selection criteria
is simply availability and vulnerability .
he &apos;s a highly organized thinker and planner ,
and he executes his ruse with confidence ,
but he is on a spree and he will devolve .
lapd should increase patrols in targeted neighborhoods ,
and my team will visit and assess the earlier crime scenes .
thank you .
this is it , huh ?
yeah . the second victim , isabella jayne , lived here .
the neighborhood is supposed to be up and coming .
yeah , i saw the yoga studio next to the sro .
there &apos;s bound to be some sketchy elements
when you live in a transitional neighborhood .
so someone in law enforcement showing up to the front door
might be a welcome sight instead of seen as a threat .
rossi .
what do you think that &apos;s about ?
hold up .
let &apos;s check it out .
fbi . we &apos;re investigating a homicide up the street .
what happened here ?
home invasion homicide 3 days ago .
some coincidence , huh ?
two violent crimes on one block ?
it might not be such a coincidence .
hey , baby girl , listen ,
i need you to check the neighborhoods around our crime scenes ,
see if any unrelated crimes went down before ours .
whatever you what , my caramel mocha surprise .
oh , by the by , i have been searching
for inmates with a spider web tattoo .
i &apos;m currently up to 17,000 paroled prisoners and counting .
hey , that &apos;s something .
what ? what are you seeing ?
i just pulled up lapd crime @-@ mapping data ,
and in all 4 of our cases there was a homicide
or a rape of a female within a two @-@ block radius .
when did those other crimes happen ?
like hours before each of our victims were suffocated .
he may have a stolen police radio
or a scanner app on his phone .
so he listens for reports of sexual assault or murder
within his hunting grounds and then trolls those areas
for women he can target .
a lot of violent crime in transitional neighborhoods .
he capitalizes off that , drafting off the fear
created by other criminals operating nearby .
and that fear encourages his victims to let him in
on the pretense of keeping them safe .
women should be more cautious ,
but they would also want to help catch a rapist or killer .
garcia , i need you to search the lapd database
for homicides in the hunting zone today .
already typing , sir , and no others reported in the last 6 hours .
we can &apos;t wait for the right crime to happen .
well , let &apos;s give him what he wants .
let &apos;s set a trap using undercover agents and cops .
and grab him before he gets to his next victim .
we need a safe house in the hunting zone .
we &apos;ve got one right in the middle .
well , he always strikes within two blocks of the crime scene .
to be safe , we &apos;ll need
every plainclothes officer and agent you have
to cover a 3 @-@ block radius .
i &apos;ll coordinate with lapd .
i can have 20 undercovers in place within the hour .
now , let &apos;s be clear about this--
we &apos;re luring a spree killer
into an unsuspecting neighborhood ,
with dozens of potential victims .
we &apos;ll need absolute radio silence .
colfax , if your people see anyone they suspect ,
they need to approach with caution , i.d. him ,
and be absolutely sure before they call it in .
you got it .
license 7 @-@ mary @-@ david @-@ 8 ...
report of a possible abduction ...
report of a 187 @-@ 261 at 4946 pierce avenue .
looks like this started as a home invasion .
male and female dead at the scene .
7 @-@ h290 responding 4946 pierce avenue .
13 @-@ l22 requesting 7 at the station .
13 @-@ l22 , stand by .
13 @-@ l22 , continue your patrol .
13 @-@ l22 , roger .
notify m.e. &apos; s office to respond to the scene .
4946 pierce avenue .
lapd and our people are all in place .
i hope this works .
he &apos;s on a spree . this is our only chance of stopping him .
hey , buddy .
you live here ?
that &apos;s ok . agent miller , fbi .
great . detective oliver , lapd .
can i see your credentials ?
yeah , sure .
shots fired ! shots fired !
did you find him yet ?
he got away , but we set up roadblocks .
he &apos;s probably wounded . i got a shot off before he drove away .
we &apos;ll check with local hospitals .
tell us exactly what happened when you approached him .
did you recognize him right away ?
no . i mean , he fit the general description ,
but he could have been a boyfriend .
so i asked if he lived there .
what did he say ?
&quot; it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m agent miller with the fbi . &quot;
so i showed him my badge and i asked for his credentials .
and that &apos;s when i saw it .
spider web tattoo .
he got off two shots before i even cleared my holster .
and then he took off for his car .
what do you remember about his car ?
dark @-@ blue sedan , probably crown vic .
there was a baseball cap in the rear window .
i tried to make the plates ,
but the light above the license was out .
probably disabled it .
tell us more about the baseball cap .
were there any identifying marks or anything ?
i think there were two rifles ,
a white one and a red one .
wait a minute . was one crossed over the other ?
yeah , i think so .
the cap had to be from camp russell .
the old firing range at quantico ?
isn &apos;t it shut down ?
yeah , 10 years ago .
every class that went through there had a unique baseball cap .
so he put it in the back window
to look legit to cops and other agents .
more affirmation seeking behavior .
i check . the only year
they used that rifle design was 1988 .
ok , so how did this guy get it ?
how did he even know its significance ?
he must have stolen it .
garcia &apos;s checking the graduates right now .
speaking of which ...
what do you have , penelope ?
a whole lot of fun in the sun on the redneck riviera .
the camp russell alum of 1988 is mostly retired ,
and judging from the facebook photos
of the crystal @-@ blue waters and the mai @-@ tais ,
i &apos;m thinking of joining .
and those who aren &apos;t retired ?
deceased , unfortunately .
any retirees still living in the l.a. area ?
yes , two . agents larry guerin and ed sulzbach .
i spoke to agent guerin . he still has his camp russell cap .
no response from ed yet .
did you contact the family ?
his east coast relatives haven &apos;t heard from him .
agent guerin missed agent sulzbach yesterday
at a alumni barbecue that he threw ,
but he didn &apos;t think anything of it
because ed often goes off alone on long fishing trips .
i don &apos;t know . a retired guy missing an annual barbecue
with his agent buddies ?
find out everything you can about agent sulzbach .
no stone unturned . in the meantime , here &apos;s his address .
agent sulzbach ? fbi .
found him .
preliminary c.o.d. &apos; s a gunshot wound to the chest .
look at all this .
definitely had a decorated career in the fbi .
so someone went through all of his old case files and mementos .
it had to be the unsub .
he must have stolen ed &apos;s credentials and camp russell hat .
hey , penelope , what do you have on sulzbach ?
ed was a really good egg .
after he retired in 2009,
he went on to volunteer at a place called new start ,
which helps recently released inmates
transition back into society .
anyone matching the unsub &apos;s profile and description ?
yes . spider web tattoo and all .
andrew meeks . 39 .
he was put on parole last year after serving
15 years for attempted murder .
sulzbach got him a job as a janitor
at a downtown office building .
must have gotten ed to tell war stories
about being in the fbi , saw the respect he got ,
and wanted it for himself .
we should put out an apb on sulzbach &apos;s car .
it &apos;s probably what the unsub &apos;s driving .
garcia , who did meeks try to murder ?
uh ... fellow high school classmate who as a prank
rolled meeks in a gym mat .
some high school girls lured meeks into the gym .
so all of this is about payback ?
meeks almost suffocated inside that mat .
by smothering those women , he &apos;s symbolically
getting revenge on those girls who set him up .
and posing as an fbi agent ,
he gets the power and authority he never had before .
address , please .
work and home just sent .
andrew meeks !
get out . get out .
back off ...
or she &apos;s dead .
all units be advised ,
suspect meeks located with hostage at 352 vine .
officers request immediate backup .
suspect is armed and dangerous .
jj , you &apos;re closest . we &apos;ll be there as soon as we can .
you got it .
go ahead , garcia .
i &apos;ve dug deeper into meeks &apos; past .
i &apos;ve got his psych eval . it &apos;s really terrible .
how bad is it ?
it &apos;s not an excuse , but his stepfather was the evil kind .
meeks had accidents up to the age of 6,
which is normal for a kid .
but his stepdad would make him wear
his soiled underwear on his face in public .
so meeks &apos; humiliation started young .
and it &apos;s been building for a long time .
and before he was paroled , meeks &apos; psychologist said ,
&quot; meeks if full of latent rage , for all intents and purposes ,
a ticking time bomb . &quot;
he recommended that meeks go to a psychiatric facility .
how did they parole this guy ?
you know , it happens all the time .
some judge probably ordered a
prisoner release due to overcrowding ,
and meeks must have just slipped through the cracks .
sulzbach may have discovered that
he had access to meeks &apos; file .
according to sulzbach &apos;s cell phone records ,
his last call was to
the department of corrections psychologist .
it lasted all of 5 seconds .
well , that &apos;s gotta be the trigger .
he was gonna report the error ,
and meeks must have killed him
to avoid being locked up again .
be careful , you guys .
i will kill her ,
i swear to god .
oh , god , please ...
just shut up . shut up .
he make any demands ?
just shut up . just shut up .
lock down the perimeter . he &apos;s not getting out of here .
got it .
lock it down . no one in or out .
you ready ?
just shut up !
andrew meeks , fbi .
drop the weapon , andrew !
you drop your weapon !
the only way you &apos;re getting out of here
is if you let her go and put the gun down .
no !
no way .
you wanted revenge , but this ends right here , right now .
she &apos;s terrified , andrew .
you hear her breathing ?
do you remember feeling scared like that
when you were being smothered in that gym mat ?
so , you did it !
&quot; you see what power is --
holding someone else &apos;s fear in our hand
and showing it to them . &quot;
amy tan .
excuse me .
yeah , my bad .
hey there .
well , hey yourself .
baby , listen --
don &apos;t tell me you have another case .
no . no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m on my way home . i swear , i &apos;m coming home .
good . me , too .
look , savannah ,
you remember how you texted me earlier and ,
you know , you said we needed to talk ?
come on , now .
what ?
savannah , you gotta tell me what this is about .
at least give me a hint .
nope .
look , if i &apos;m coming home to a firing line ,
i think i deserve to know that . uh ...
baby , seriously , look ...
are you unhappy ?
