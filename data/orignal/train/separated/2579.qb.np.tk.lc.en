第一季 第十集

are you pleading for the lives of the feds ?
there &apos;s enough blood on the floor .
it &apos;s time to get the hell out of here .
oh , i know what time it is .
you watch out for old red here .
he may not look like much ,
but i once saw him kill a somali with a wire hanger .
simpler days , anslo .
simpler days . right .
bring her .
she doesn &apos;t do anything for you , anslo .
she &apos;s dead weight .
do i look like i care what you say , red ?
everyone get down now .
coward .
knees .
secure the area and contact headquarters !
don &apos;t move . we &apos;re getting help . i &apos;m gonna get you out of here .
i need a phone !
i have to admit , red , i was starting to think
you &apos;d never come out of the box .
but then her .
she was unexpected .
old boy &apos;s still got the touch , does he ?
well , whatever blows up your skirt .
hold on tight .
red .
breach team 5 ! identify yourself !
i &apos;m assistant director harold cooper !

fbi ! follow that ambulance ! drive ! now !
give me your phone ! give it to me !
hello ?
aram !
agent keen , are you okay ?
sir ! are you -- are you with mr. reddington ?
i &apos;m in pursuit , but i &apos;ve lost visual !
i &apos;m headed west on constitution .
do you have a location ? they &apos;re trying to pull his chip .
hurry the hell up ! close to the drop point !
30 seconds !
i &apos;m trying !
just give me the bloody chip ! come on !
aram , where are they ?
okay , six blocks west . turn right at the intersection .
turn right ! right here ! right here !
15 seconds . 2 blocks .
get me that damned chip !
okay , you &apos;re close . he just turned south on 7th .
okay , the signal has stopped moving .
he &apos;s right there . he &apos;s in the street .
yeah , this is the right location .
we &apos;ve got nothing .
agent keen , did you find him ?
no , he &apos;s gone .
we lost reddington .
oh , this shall be fun .
how did this happen ?
anslo garrick was a known associate of reddington &apos;s .
he came in with a tactical assault team .
he knew the floor plan .
then i have no choice .
this task force is decommissioned .
diane -- - do you understand what has happened , harold ?
you obviously have a mole .
we have to find reddington .
the only thing that matters right now
is how quickly we contain this .
this did not happen .
reddington is , and always has been , a fugitive at large .
aram , wait .
you can &apos;t -- - we &apos;re done . i &apos;m done .
listen to me -- red &apos;s alive .
liz , this is out of my hands .
okay , assuming ...
i could help ...
what would you need ?
closed @-@ circuit feeds from the block around the building
from when reddington came in , going back an hour .
supposed to hand off the security feeds
to the new team of investigators .
i suppose i could make us a copy .
thank you .
how do you think ressler &apos;s doing ?
he &apos;s in surgery .
they &apos;re hoping they can save his leg .
aram ...
we got to keep this between us .
we don &apos;t know who we can trust .
yeah .
emissary hotel . how may i direct your call ?
yes . hi . a mr. kaplan , please .
he &apos;s not available .
can you be reached at this number ?
this ...
uh , yes , i suppose .
goodbye .
the girl .
the agent .
i want to know who she is .
you came out of the box for her .
traded your life for hers .
red reddington placing somebody else &apos;s life ahead his own .
what makes her so special ?
i learned so much watching you , red .
you taught me ...
gave me a taste of the good life .
but that &apos;s all i was allowed -- a taste .
you &apos;re greedy , anslo .
you went behind my back ,
made deals you knew i wouldn &apos;t approve .
what did you expect ?
i suppose i expected something better
than a bullet in the face , red .
are you okay ? - yeah , i --
i didn &apos;t know what was happening . i @-@ i ...
i know .
who -- who -- who was that man on the phone ?
it &apos;s nothing .
what happened to your face ?
i &apos;m okay .
damn it , you need to stop . you need to stop .
you need to walk away from this job
before it destroys you .
don &apos;t . listen to me . don &apos;t answer it .
all right ? look at me . we can go .
go ?
anywhere .
nebraska . we talked about moving there someday ,
at your dad &apos;s funeral .
someday .
i got caught up in the middle of something .
i have to take this .
aram , what do you have for me ?
i sent you the files .
our cameras cover five blocks around the office
in every direction .
okay , i &apos;ll look through them right now .
don &apos;t bother . red wasn &apos;t followed .
he came in at 5 : 15 .
no tail cars , no eyes on the street .
damn it .
how did garrick know he was in the post office ?
my question exactly .
so i started thinking ...
what if somebody inside already tipped him off ?
you found the mole ?
no .
but i think i have a lead .
we routinely collect all cellular transmission
from inside and directly around this facility .
so much data --
i had to play around with various mathematical structures --
knots , multivariate polynomials --
aram , the lead ?
right .
i found a pattern in the transmissions --
a series of calls made from a burner cell .
each call was placed just seconds
after reddington arrived at the post office .
all from the same burner ?
no .
all from different burners ,
but all the calls were to the same number .
i vectored the address
to a private residence a few miles from here .
the address is 8123.12th street .
what ?
i &apos;ll call you right back .
as with everything involving you
things are more complicated than they may appear .
if i could , i &apos;d end this right now --
give you the horrifying death
that you so deserve .
then do it .
yeah . when it &apos;s time .
you see , sadly , this isn &apos;t my surprise party .
i am merely the hired help .
my job was to get you to the venue .
and while i would pay a high price to silence you forever ,
others have paid much more
for the chance to hear what you have to say .
please .
anesthesia blocks the impulses to the brain
so one doesn &apos;t feel the sensation of pain .
the drug that the kind doctor is giving you does the opposite .
it enhances the impulses received by the brain .
when he &apos;s finished ,
the feeling of a breeze wafting against your skin
will be enough to make you beg me to kill you .
cooper .
agent keen ? agent keen , are you there ?
mr. kaplan ?
what color is the sky ?
red .
you ?
you &apos;re mr. kaplan ?
who else knows you &apos;re here ?
nobody .
have you phoned anyone ?
no .
who is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
every time reddington came to the post office ,
a call was made to this address -- i assume to him .
he &apos;s been watching .
when he got word that red was at the post office ,
he must have called garrick to trigger the hit .
i &apos;ll handle the body .
&quot; handle &quot; ?
we need the bullets .
we can &apos;t have ballistics traced to your weapon .
okay , wait . i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m a federal agent .
i have two directives --
to protect you and find my employer .
i intend to do both .
my team will be here soon . find his car .
210 over 145 .
103.7 .
increase the dosage .
we &apos;re already 12 cc over the max .
then why isn &apos;t it working ? !
he &apos;s resisting somehow .
i can stick him again ,
but if his heart goes into v @-@ fib , we could lose him .
stick him again .
i ran his face against the database .
what database ?
no matches .
the car is registered to borderland cargo --
a shell corp with a dummy address .
what about the gps data ?
if he works for the man holding red ,
then maybe he &apos;s been there before .
you have six addresses .
five are centrally located --
a motel , a church , two gas stations ,
and a restaurant in alexandria .
but this ? this is something .
why ?
it &apos;s an industrial neighborhood , remote .
the kind of place i &apos;d find for mr. reddington
if i didn &apos;t want him to be found .
time for a road trip .
armed lookouts .
what are you doing ?
calling it in . we need backup .
stay in the car . my orders are to keep you safe .
i think we &apos;re ready here .
about bloody time .
we &apos;ve got company .
what the hell is this place ?
he &apos;s not here .
how are we ?
he &apos;s ready for you , sir .
hello , ray .
it &apos;s been , what ...
20 years ?
tell me , agent keen ,
which part of stand down wasn &apos;t clear to you ?
this wasn &apos;t my operation .
fowler may have shut us down , but did you really think
reddington &apos;s people weren &apos;t gonna try to find him themselves ?
they did this without your involvement ?
the only reason you &apos;re standing here
is because they trust me enough to involve me .
enlighten me . what is all this ?
some kind of operations outpost
three miles from the post office .
seems to be manned by the same people
who infiltrated our facility and kidnapped reddington .
that doesn &apos;t concern you ?
i lost a dozen people today , keen !
that isn &apos;t on you . it &apos;s on me .
no one wants the men who did this more than i do .
but riding shotgun on an unsanctioned massacre
isn &apos;t the way to get it done .
excuse me , director cooper ?
what is it ?
there &apos;s something you need to see .
i thought i was clear --
this task force is done .
i think you &apos;ll reconsider .
why in god &apos;s name would i do that ?
because this isn &apos;t just about reddington anymore .
agent keen located a surveillance outpost .
a few miles from here .
next @-@ gen tech , better than anything we have in the field .
surveillance on what ?
us .
they &apos;ve been watching this task force for months --
phone taps , communications logs --
we &apos;re not sure to what extent .
we were able to recover very little .
the equipment and data were rigged to self @-@ destruct .
i don &apos;t understand . how is this even possible ?
something else you should know .
they &apos;ve been watching you , too .
all right , that &apos;s enough . let him down .
come on . get him a chair .
i don &apos;t understand , ray . none of this had to happen .
i thought we had an arrangement .
we do .
eh , i don &apos;t know .
the people i represent , they &apos;re ...
they &apos;re nervous .
we don &apos;t know what to think .
we could &apos;ve killed you .
i don &apos;t mean today . i mean any day .
i mean every day for the past two decades .
but we don &apos;t .
we know what you have , ray .
and we know what &apos;ll happen to it if you turn up dead .
so we do nothing . we let you live .
and in exchange ,
we -- we trust that our secret remains secret .
nothing has changed .
oh , no .
i &apos;d say everything &apos;s changed .
everything changed the minute you surrendered to the fbi .
did you think we wouldn &apos;t know ?
maybe you wanted to change our arrangement .
maybe you thought you could turn yourself in ,
and , uh , find some new friends to protect you .
maybe you plan to expose us .
no .
what have you told , ray ?
nothing .
then what the hell are you doing here ?
my reasons have n @-@ nothing to do with you .
well , i hope so .
i really do .
because i &apos;ve always liked you , ray .
you &apos;re a pain in my neck , but ...
i like you .
just know this --
you were walking in the park this morning .
we could &apos;ve taken you then .
instead , we dragged you from the safety and security
of the bed you &apos;re now sharing with new friends .
why would we do a thing like that ?
to make it abundantly clear --
there &apos;s nowhere you can go ...
there &apos;s no one you can trust to keep you from us .
you were there ?
when reddington &apos;s people took the building ?
how many people were killed ?
at least six .
it was an outpost . professionals .
these people were highly trained .
like garrick .
what &apos;s all this ?
a waste of time .
by cooper &apos;s directive ,
i reached out to a few of our colleagues at the agency ,
informed them of our situation , and offered to contact
my counterparts at the other black sites to share intel .
all these names are redacted .
so much for inter @-@ agency cooperation .
you really think that garrick had someone on the inside ?
it &apos;s possible .
the only one beyond suspicion is ressler ,
unless he used garrick to shoot him in the leg
to cover his tracks .
is he still in surgery ?
four hours and counting .
hollins ferry road . i know that address .
it says dcm -- what does that mean ?
decommissioned .
here i am trying to help , and the only names
that aren &apos;t blacked out are sites that are no longer in use .
is that a church ?
well , that &apos;s the cover story .
i &apos;m gonna need satellite access to this address .
why ?
because i think this might be where they &apos;re holding reddington .
is this in franklin square ?
yeah . why ?
the ambulance that was used to abduct reddington
they found burning in a garage a quarter mile from there .
i think we found reddington .
where ?
a church in baltimore -- a decommissioned black site .
a black site ? you think that &apos;s where they &apos;re holding reddington ?
it makes sense . it &apos;s the last place we would think of .
and if he knew about this site , he &apos;d know about others .
what about it , diane ? i need an answer .
are we shut down or not ?
you should go , sir .
i &apos;ll take care of reddington .
no .
we had a deal .
i delivered him for interrogation .
i took that risk because you promised --
i know what we promised .
but i don &apos;t know is whether he &apos;s telling the truth .
if you kill him , it could trigger whatever he has in place .
with all due respect , sir , that &apos;s not my problem .
excuse me ?
i lost a lot of men today -- couple of good ones .
you had your talk .
now it &apos;s my turn .
just you and me again , red . just like the old days .
oh , give it a rest .
we both know fitch won &apos;t let you finish it .
that &apos;s as may be .
but you know what i can do , though , red ?
i can find lizzy .
i can hurt her . i can make her suffer .
and when i &apos;m finished , i can kill her .
sometimes you just have to take what you can
in this crazy world .
guess who taught me that , red .
you did .
what ? no smart quips ?
no ?
you &apos;re not actually feeling something , are you , red ?
regret .
clear .
man down .
he was here .
in what world is any of this okay ?
the fact that you don &apos;t see that ,
that this is somehow normal to you--
i &apos;m sorry .
a man told me that he was gonna kill you .
i &apos;ve been attacked , i &apos;ve been accused of murder ,
and now people are watching us .
apparently , there are cameras in our bedroom .
they &apos;re gone .
do you believe that ?
i need us together ... and safe .
i meant what i said earlier .
we need to leave this place .
audrey ?
what are you doing here ?
i got a call . you okay ?
yeah . yeah , long story .
i &apos;m fine .
they called you ?
bureau did .
i guess i &apos;m still on as your &quot; next of kin . &quot;
right . your name &apos;s still on that list .
i meant to take it off . i &apos;ve just been so busy , i ...
no , no , no . it &apos;s okay . i get it .
so , you &apos;re okay ?
you &apos;re engaged ?
it &apos;s crazy , right ?
tell me he &apos;s fat and unemployed .
he &apos;s fat and unemployed .
mind staying for a few minutes ?
he was there .
lab tests confirm the blood was reddington &apos;s .
which means ?
as far as we can tell , he killed his captor and escaped .
then why aren &apos;t you out hunting him down ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
i thought we were in the &quot; cover our asses &quot; business ,
in containment mode .
that ship has sailed , harold .
someone is surveilling us , and we don &apos;t know who .
reddington does .
you don &apos;t know that .
we have a mole .
that mole leaked intel
leading to the abduction and torture of reddington .
it &apos;s a simple math problem , harold .
whoever is after reddington is after us ,
and that means , as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
that reddington still has real value .
the unit has a new focus -- finding him .
as of this moment ,
the only target on the blacklist
is raymond reddington .
