This is court-ordered mediation.
It's not opt-out mediation
or I-don't-feel-like-it mediation.
We know that, but what can we do?
We can't negotiate with a stone.
Yes, but you can lower your ask.
Given the set of facts I'm looking at,
well, it's way to high.
And the law is far from clear as to...
Then let's go to court.
Look, the judge doesn't want to clutter up his docket.
That's why he empowered me to keep you here
as long as I want to reach a compromise.
And I will.
So show me some movement.
Our client wanted to sue for $38 million in punitive.
We got her down to 14.
That is movement.
But where is theirs?
Think about a new ask.
I need you to raise your offer.
Oh, come on.
Given the set of facts I'm looking at,
well, it's way too low.
And the legal issues...
What about their ask?
$12 million for what was clearly an accident?
$14 million.
Oh, my God. It keeps going up.
No, it was always $14 million.
Exactly, because they won't move.
That's Will Gardner's M.O.
He gets his opposition negotiating with themselves
so he can just sit back and...
Okay, the good news is,
they've agreed to an increase in their offer.
Really?
Yes-- $100,000.
As a goodwill gesture.
But it's linked to an equivalent reduction in your ask.
We're not meeting in the middle.
You are meetig in the middle.
Everyone's meeting in the middle, or I keep you here.
This was an unfortunate accident...
Wait a minute.
I know Celeste works under the mistaken impression
that if she says something enough times,
it'll make it true,
but this wasn't an accident; this was fraud.
Deposition 101, page 58.
"But wasn't this an accident, ma'am?" Answer...
No, an accident is unintentional.
What your client did to me was intentional.
You sound angry, ma'am.
Do I?
I guss I am. I...
Would you like to take a break, Maggie?
Can we get you anything for your pain?
Thank you, Mr. Gardner.
Why don't we let Maggie raise her hand when she wants to take a break
instead of continually vocalizing her pain into the record?
Wow, Celeste. Cynical much?
Only since your fifth interruption.
Thank you,
but I don't need a break.
She doesn't need a break, Will.
Can I continue now?
It's up to you.
This was all caused by an accident four years ago, wasn't it?
I was in a car accident.
It caused DDD-- degenerative disc disorder.
It's misaligned vertebrae discs.
And Dr. Farland, the man you are suing, my client,
suggested an operation.
He did.
He said I needed an SCS-- a spinal cord stimulator.
A device like this?
Our client was given a chance to choose
which model to have surgically implanted
from a catalogue of 12 FDA-approved models.
But she didn't choose any-- that's the defense's point.
Yes, but I expected him
to pick one of the FDA-approved devices.
I was never told there was another option.
And what happened after the operation, Maggie?
The pain was gone.
I was ready to worship Dr. Farland.
But then the pain came back?
Yes, it was like a deal with the Devil.
It came back three times worse.
But that's not why you brought suit.
No. About a month after my operation,
I received an itemized bill for the SCS.
On it was listed the manufacturer and the inventor.
And who was the inventor?
My doctor, Dr. Farland.
And this device he invented--
it was not FDA-approved?
That's right.
He just implanted it in me like I was a guinea pig.
I want to sympathize--
I do-- but you can't keep asking for $14 million.
Maggie has three children.
She is in constant pain.
Her life has been shortened by a decade.
Her husband left her,
and she's being kicked out of her house,
all because she can not hold down a job
or offer spousal companionship.
Now, if that happened to me
from a doctor who experimented on me without my knowledge,
I'm sorry, but I would be asking for twice as much.
Good job. Keep on him.
And, everyone, the mediator's threatening
to keep us here through the weekend,
and I think he means it, so make arrangements.
We might have a slight edge in mediation.
The mediator seems sympathetic.
Really? Will that matter?
Not really.
We're heading to trial either way,
but it shows our argument's working.
What's up there?
I just got a call.
Someone who needs crisis management.
One of our clients?
No, someone impressed with the Florrick rehabilitation.
Now I'm starting to feel like a slacker.
Eli is starting to clock more billable hours than us.
Who is it, one of the airlines?
I heard a jet went off the runway at O'Hare.
No, but I might be able to sign them.
I can decide for both of us?
Yes. Just keep me in the loop.
Cheese.
Cheese?
Yes. We represent the Wisconsin State Dairy Guild,
and we need your help.
With cheese?
Yes.
A certain kind of cheese or all cheese?
There was an outbreak of listeriosis
in a Chicago grammar school four hours ago.
News reports say the outbreak
was traced to bacterial-infected cheese slices.
Five children are hospitalized,
four teachers are ill,
and we're getting alarmed calls from government officials.
Patrick! Lydia!
Does the guild have a contract with an existing PR firm?
Keyser & Associates.
They're working on an "Eat Cheese" Campaign.
Not anymore. You hire me, I am one voice.
Tell me that's ok, we're going forward.
I'll have to get permission.
That's fine for now,
but I need someone here who doesn't need to get permission.
Monthly retainer of $60,000 a month.
Hourly still applies. You'll find that's competitive.
Fine.
Get me everything on listeriosis,
anyone who will speak out against cheese.
And I'll need more investigator time. Get Kalinda.
She's on the mediation.
Not anymore.
60... 60 a month...
W-wait, hold on.
...may also be tainted.
It was just after recess.
The culprit-- the most innocent of foods.
Cheese.
This cell phone video,
Oh, dear God.
shot by a cafeteria worker,
captures several students becoming gravely ill...
We're worried this is gonna keep people from purchasing cheese.
You think?
Cheeseburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches...
You'll have to hire Lockhart/Gardner
as temporary counsel.
Actually, we have outside counsel.
Okay, I can explain myself for now,
but when things move faster,
you're going to have to just trust me.
Currently, everything we say and do can be subpoenaed
for civil or criminal trial.
And believe me, with news like this,
you do not want that.
We need to be able to speak
under cover of attorney-client privilege,
which Diane provides, and we need it now!
Go ahead, get permission.
Hi, Walter. Still there?
We also need to hire Lockhart/Gardner
as temporary counsel.
...as we learn more.
And get me the CEO of Heather Farms--
before he talks to a reporter.
Here he comes now.
You just tell him what you told me.
What's wrong? Is everything all right?
I don't know. I got a call from someone at the Vindicator.
She asked if I had an opinion about the results
of the medical investigation of Dr. Farland.
I don't understand. It's a year off.
I know.
She said the FDA expedited it.
She got an early look, and they're siding with Dr. Farland.
It may not be true.
It doesn't matter.
Any rumor of an investigation that goes against us hurts us.
Did this reporter say when she wanted a comment?
This afternoon.
She has to go to press Monday with the leak.
Here's her number.
She's the Metro editor.
Kate Hanson-- I know her. Let me give her a call.
She'll be easy to stall.
Thank you for doing this.
Once more around the park.
So what do you think?
I think we have a gun to our head,
and can't wait for trial.
We have to get a good deal in mediation.
Damn!
Be right there.
Owen, can you do me a favor?
Diane, we...
I'll call you back.
I think the mediator's lying to us.
I think you're right.
Two hours and a bottle of wine,
we can settle this.
Just this? Why not the Middle East?
It's game theory with imperfect information, Will.
Why don't we make it perfect?
I thought you liked imperfect.
Poker over chess.
You sure you're on the right floor?
I'm serious.
We used to settle a lot of things in the old days.
We used to unsettle a lot of things, too.
I'm going into my room now.
You haven't heard our case yet. It's a good one.
Then I can't wait. Good-bye, Celeste.
My number.
When you're ready to negotiate.
The whole weekend.
Maybe not the whole one.
It's hot, right? The nights are hot?
Oh, steaming.
Sultry with the scent of jasmine, forbidden love.
Coat, no coat?
No coat.
You're fine with this, right?
I just need someone with the kids through Sunday
Sure. The fun uncle.
I'm the fun uncle.
You and Will, in a hotel room.
Yes
Will, me, four lawyers,
six of their lawyers and a mediator
You and Will check out the hot tub.
In a businessman's hotel.
The best sex I ever had was in a businessman's hotel.
Oh, okay. Can we not go there?
You are so funny.
You are the most prudish wanton woman I know.
Hey. What was that?
What? Nothing. I have to go.
But you were about to say something.
You won't get in a fight with Peter right?
He's picking up the kids for dinner Saturday night.
I didn't mean it--
about the "wanton"
Alicia, talk to me.
Owen, I would if I had the time.
You have to wait for the elevator,
so talk to me here.
Okay.
You're sleeping with Will,
which is why you left your husband.
Oh, come on.
I'll call you later.
Gretchen Battista.
No, Kate retired three months ago.
I'm her replacement, Mr....
Gardner.
Yeah, so you'll be getting a package
in about an hour or so, Ms. Battista.
Just ignore it.
Oh, I already got it.
My parents drink Scotch.
They'll be really grateful.
And what might you need?
You contacted my client
for a comment on the FDA investigation.
I thought I might help.
You wouldn't happen to be fishing for what I might know,
would you, Mr. Gardner?
I might be.
I just find it odd that you'd be
the only reporter leaked an FDA decision.
Maybe I'm just a better reporter.
And maybe you have a source that's lying
and trying to undermine this negotiation.
So come in for an interview, and you can offer some context.
Okay. How about lunch on Monday?
Oh, you mean after my deadline? Oh, I don't think so.
How about in my office in one hour?
Two hours.
I thought we had agreed this morning to lower your ask by $100,000.
Yes, and we reevaluated our position,
and we're staying with our original ask.
I'm glad you think it's funny.
I thought we were making progress.
Oh, we are making progress.
Mr. Gardner has a tell.
When he's in trouble, he doubles down.
So we're lowering our offer.
You don't think the issues here
are too serious to treat like gambling?
No, gambling is too serious to treat like these issues.
We're lowering our offer.
You all right?
No.
Okay.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Will wants me to get some inkling of their bottom line in mediation.
Why?
Eli needs your help.
Heather Farms outside Bloomington.
The USDA is investigating this listeria outbreak,
and they tend to be slow.
Well, which takes priority, cheese or mediation?
Both.
All right, got it.
I expect mediation to extend through the weekend at least,
so, um, I will be...
There is no Heather Farms.
It's just one division of Karpwell Foods.
And I don't care.
I'm not your rabbi, sir.
I'm merely trying to keep your cheese
from damaging the image of all cheeses.
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, but I do care.
It's not even clear that we're responsible.
I mean, what else did these kids eat?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, yes, that's a great line of defense.
With images like these,
people love to hear that the kids are really the problem.
Do you know who Tony Hayward is?
Do I...
Yes, he's the CEO of British Petroleum.
No, ex-CEO of BP.
The man who many think oversaw the destruction of a brand.
So first thing's first, we work on your attitude.
Excuse me? I think we need to work on...
Look, I don't have time to argue with you.
The first rule of managing a crisis:
the top man answers the questions.
That is the only reason you're here,
that is the only reason I am talking to you.
So, in ten minutes time, you're giving a press conference
where you'll order all your cheese products off the shelves.
We need a split screen of that image with you looking strong--
wrong tie, get him a red tie--
then you'll apologize for any missteps
and say the buck stops here.
Actually, he can't do that.
Actually, he can and he will.
No, legally, he's in a very vulnerable spot.
He can't be out there apologizing and taking blame.
He's gonna get sued no matter what.
Yes, but the size of the suit is still in question.
I don't care about the size of the suit, Diane.
Yes, Eli, but I do.
I'll just sit here then.
Diane, you're only here as window dressing.
You're only here to keep us from getting subpoenaed.
No, I'm here as their lawyer. You're working the images...
And the images take precedent right now.
Eli, listen to me...
He won't have a business unless he...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Protopapas.
Dr. Farland was stopping by for lunch.
But if you have any questions...
Ms. Serrano, could I speak with you?
This is really inappropriate.
We were having lunch.
It's been on the books for weeks.
I am not listening to any evidence off the record, ma'am.
And I am not offering any. I'm standing on the record.
So is the plaintiff.
And they offer a convincing case.
An easily-refuted case.
Mrs. Reeves is responsible for her own condition.
How do you figure?
Deposition 200, page 14.
It's so key, I know it from memory.
"Question: If there's nothing wrong with your device, Doctor,
how did it malfunction?"
It didn't malfunction.
Even the best SCSs
are prone to lead migration.
And a lead is...?
Oh, sorry.
When the electrical leads don't stay where intended.
It's usually not serious,
but in the case of Maggie, it became quite serious
because the problem went undetected for so long.
That's what caused the infection,
which caused the permanent damage to her spine.
And why did it go undetected?
Well, I prescribed hydromorphone for any topical pain from the surgery,
but Mrs. Reeves-- I'm sorry to say this--
but she continued to use the painkiller long afterward.
So, if Mrs. Reeves hadn't overmedicated herself,
she would have noticed the infection
and come to you for her SCS adjustment?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Reeves,
but it's true.
Oh, come on.
Why not blame the victim for having pain in the first place?
Yes, but is it true?
The device malfunctioned, the pain returned.
Only then did Maggie take the painkillers.
Celeste reverses it so she can make it
seem like the painkillers caused the problem.
If I can get her up to eight million, will you say yes?
Is she offering eight million?
Will you accept it?
If you're asking for our bottom line, then no.
We can't give you our bottom line
or they'll use it against us.
Where's Kalinda?
I thought she was looking into their bottom line.
I'll call. Where are you going?
To meet a reporter.
Tonight, school officials are reassuring parents
that all cheese has been removed from the school lunch menu
for the time being.
It's not yet clear whether cheese at neighboring schools
and stores in the area may also be tainted.
Grace!
Stop eating the pizza!
Really?
You were the bad one?
Well, yeah, I was.
Don't I seem like I was the bad one?
So, in what way bad?
Mm, no, you don't want to hear this.
No, I do want to hear this.
Ecstasy.
Driving my car into a lake, stealing stuff, juvie.
And Mom?
She was perfect.
Homework done, room clean, never did drugs.
Never did anything.
She's still like that.
She was a good sister.
Always covering for me.
You guys have a good mom.
Grace's tutor.
Hello! Hello. Can we turn it down?
Sorry.
We're almost done.
So you're the, uh, the tutor?
Uh-huh.
What subject?
Uh, physics.
And just science.
Really?
Where do you go to school?
Uh, U of C.
And, um...
What's this?
We're making a video.
We're done with all my homework.
Uh-huh. Got it.
Understood.
Oh, my God.
Pretty...
provocative stuff.
It's just street dancing.
Yeah, just freestyle.
Dad slept with somebody else.
Dad. He slept with someone other than the hooker.
He...
How do we know?
He told me.
That's why Mom kicked him out.
You didn't know that?
I didn't know that.
What are they saying?
They think it was an improper cleaning of the culture vats in Line Six.
You sound like you don't agree.
Well, I clean Line Six with peroxyacetic acid
and quaternary ammonium after every culture.
They're not gonna find listeria there.
Where else could listeria come from?
We keep these units accurate to one degree either way.
I don't think it was a refrigeration problem.
So what do you think?
I think it used to be an easy job to find the source.
Now you got some of these cheeses--
they're a blend of three or four lines from three or four companies.
So all I can say is good luck.
Damn. Are you sure?
Uh, Eli, you know this is a good thing, right?
It looks like your client isn't responsible for the listeria.
Kalinda, this is not the law.
I'm not looking for innocence, I'm looking for certainty.
The whole point is to bury this story with an apology,
then move on.
So you want our guy to be guilty?
No, I want it to be over.
I don't want to train another CEO
from some other company tomorrow to take the blame.
He can't say this.
He has to say it.
No, he can say, "I offer my deepest,
sincerest sympathies to the families."
And, "I'm doing everything I can
to trace the source of our missteps."
No.
"The source of the outbreak...
Really? Really, Diane?
He can't say anything that sounds like an admission...
Really?
I am doing everything I can
to trace the source of the outbreak.
Heather Farms is committed to finding the root of this...
So why should I hold your story?
Well, the Scotch for one.
And because it's not true.
It's not true that Dr. Farland's being investigated?
No, it's not true the investigation is going Farland's way.
And you know this how?
I know this because I can see who has an agenda.
In this case, the defense.
Heads up.
Why should I care?
Because I can make you care.
Okay.
I'll give you complete back channel on the case.
Uh, as pulse-racing as that is,
get me back channel on this.
Your computer?
Mm, no, the cheese thing.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The listeria outbreak.
All the sick kids, some were hospitalized...
Eli Gold is part of your firm, right?
I'll delay my story,
you get me the back channel ticktock on the crisis managing.
I'll have to talk to Eli.
Well, then it wouldn't be a back channel, would it?
Get me something behind the scenes.
Let me see what I can do.
Oh, and by the way, uh,
it's not the FDA investigation that's concluding.
What do you mean?
The call I got was about the State's Attorney.
Turns out,
they decided not to bring fraud charges against Dr. Farland.
May I help you?
You may.
I need information about a fraud investigation.
Are you sure?
Am I sure I have nothing to offer you about our fraud investigation? I am.
We just need to know if this leak to Gretchen Battista
was faked, Cary, that's all.
And if it was, then we need to get her to hold her story.
I understand.
I still have nothing.
How have you been?
Oh, come on.
Kalinda, you can fake somebody else, but you can't fake me.
What am I faking?
Interest, concern, friendship.
And what if I'm not?
Then let's be friends.
But I still don't have anything for you
about this fraud investigation.
Check with Matan; it's his case.
Hmm, he's no use.
Because he doesn't want to sleep with you?
But you do?
I'm merely making an observation.
And what observation might that be?
You tend to use people's feelings to further your investigations.
You think that's what I did with you?
I think I have to get back to work.
Cary, whatever I felt, I didn't invent.
That's great to know, Kalinda.
Now I have to get back to work and I think you do, too.
Yeah.
The CEO questioned the need to recall all cheese products,
suggesting that the listeria victims themselves
could have been responsible for the sickness.
I don't know that much about it at this point,
but I-I would love to know what else those kids were eating
because I don't think it's just the cheese.
Excuse me.
Look, I think it's a little premature at this point...
What the hell?
What the hell?!
What did you say?
What did you say?
What are you talking about?
I-I said exactly what you told me...
"I don't know enough, but what else did these kids eat"?
You know what you do when you don't know enough?
You shut the hell up.
I didn't say that.
With a garbage bag in your hand?
What are you, Chico and the Man?
Oh, that-- that was in the morning, before I met you.
The press was in front of my house.
They're playing it like you just said it.
They can't do that.
Oh, where do you live-- Fairyland?
Of course they can do that.
Okay, Eli, what now?
Well, he's burned as a spokesman.
You're going to have to get
all the cheese off all the shelves in Illinois.
No, I don't think that's possible.
He just blamed the victim. It just became possible.
Owen, thank you so much.
I've been in mediation all day, couldn't get away.
How are the kids?
Good.
Grace is bonding with a shy dance teacher
and Peter told Zach that he slept with another woman.
What?
Oh, Grace is bonding with a...
No, what did Peter say?
Oh, yeah, he told Zach, your son, that he, Peter,
was at fault for you kicking him out
'cause he slept with somebody else,
and so now I'm wondering who that somebody else was.
Zach told you this?
He did.
And what did Zach say to him?
To Pe-- nothing.
I think he just took it in.
So who, who is it?
I have to go back to work.
Come on,
Alicia, work is like this new avoidance tactic for you.
Is Zach all right?
Zach's fine.
Zach... he's, he's wondering how you are.
How... how are you?
I've got to get back to work.
There you are.
Kuhn?
Yep, I think you were up by 32 last time we played.
Nine years ago?
That's right, you always hated my memory thing.
One Cheerio ante?
Two-- inflation.
So I heard you got married.
Twice.
Heard you didn't.
You were always bad at bluffing.
Who's the lady friend?
The...?
The lawyer.
I get a strong possessive sense there.
You're not going to say?
I say either way, you'll use it in negotiations.
Call.
So how do you know Gretchen?
Gretchen?
The reporter. Through your firm?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hmm, so are we gonna play cards all night
or are we gonna negotiate?
How about both?
You lose this hand,
you convince your client to take my deal.
I lose this hand,
I convince my client to take your deal.
What deal?
$10 million.
And if I lose?
She takes $500,000.
So that's your bottom line, huh, $10 million?
I miss you, Will, I really do.
Why did you drop out?
I didn't.
Moved on.
To...?
Adulthood.
As I remember, we did some pretty adult things ourselves.
Come on, one bet.
We settle this like adults.
No mediator.
Your lady friend will be so impressed
when you show up at her door with $10 million in your hand.
No, thanks.
Oh, come on.
Where's the old Will?
Embrace the risk.
No, thanks.
Wuss.
Too bad, you would have won.
Anything?
They want to pay $500,000,
but they're willing to go to $10 million.
You're kidding?
Nope.
We were willing to take $5 million.
The only bad news is, I don't think she planted
the story with Gretchen,
but I can't tell.
She's a good bluffer.
Anything else?
Yeah, she's gonna try to play you.
In what way?
Jealousy.
Using your past?
To what end?
Rattle you,
get you to admit the bottom line just for the kick of it.
So you and her, huh?
Two years.
I just don't see it.
I was a different person.
And she's the same?
Oh, yeah.
Well...
What if I play jealous...
...for the mediator?
Maybe you should.
Tantric sex.
No, sex sex.
No, no, tantric sex.
You have to eschew frictional orgasm
for a higher form of ecstasy.
No, can't we have a little frictional orgasm?
We don't touch, we don't undress.
We talk about our childhoods,
anything but sex.
Delaying gratification is to increase gratification.
Yeah, but I've spent the last three hours doing laundry,
and the kids are gonna be home in a couple of hours,
so I don't really have time for delayed gratification.
They're home early.
Oh, Owen.
Hello. What a surprise.
Uh, how are you?
Jackie, how... funny.
Yes, so Peter asked me to pick up Zach and Grace.
I hope you don't mind, I have my old key.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
My name is Finn.
Uh, Finn's a friend of mine from school.
Jackie, you're a little early.
Yes, well, I thought I'd clean up.
It always gets so messy here.
But, um, why don't I come back later?
No, no, sit down, talk with us.
You must have incredible stories to tell about your life.
Finn, Jackie's early.
She needs to go.
No, no, thi-this is a perfect moment for us to learn about her past.
Tell us about your childhood.
My childhood?
Yes.
Where should I start?
Chicago was very different when I was a girl.
No, mommy will help you.
No, Mommy will.
I have to go.
Good-bye.
Kids?
Boy and girl.
You think this mediation is hard?
I'm really sorry about all of this.
Hey, they're all tough.
We just have to remain human.
How do we do that?
Find a box for this
and keep it in that box.
Thank you.
No change that you're gonna find
We are not paying a cent above her medical bills.
Then let's go to court.
You failed, Will.
Just face the fact.
Okay, stop.
How did I...?
The point of bringing you two together is to talk, not to shout.
I know what it looks like when he fails,
and he is failing.
Alicia, talk to him.
Excuse me?
I'm just saying, Will and I talked last night...
Celeste...
What?
And we were trying to negotiate a deal,
but clearly his ego got in the way,
and I used to be able to talk to him.
I can't talk to him now,
so you'll have to talk to him.
Celeste, what are you doing?
I'm talking to her.
I'm just saying that Will and I got together,
we had a productive session, that's all,
and I was thinking we should do that again.
Okay, I think we've taken a turn towards the personal,
and what I think we should maybe...
Excuse me.
Okay, you want to be productive?
Let's be productive.
You already tried the blame-the-victim defense
with your painkiller O.D. Fiction.
That didn't work.
Who's saying it didn't work?
I am.
Well, we'll prove the opposite in court.
No, you won't.
I know the judge. He won't allow it.
So maybe you should raise.
Jason Doyle.
Zuggler Med project manager.
Deposition 207, page 13.
What's this? The backup plan?
"Question: So you believe you were within your rights
"to manufacture this SCS device,
"and Dr. Farland was within his rights
to implant it in his patient""
Of course.
According to the FDA's own rules.
But Mr. Gardner seemed to imply
that Dr. Farland was Josef Mengele.
Josef...?
The...
That's okay.
FDA rules say
that you were within your rights to manufacture this device, correct?
Yes. They allow manufacturers, like ourselves, to decide
which devices need to be submitted to them for approval.
And if a new device is merely a minor modification,
then, according to FDA guidelines,
it doesn't need approval.
Ms. Serrano's reading is surprisingly selective.
Why don't you keep going?
What is this?
That? It's a BR1. It's a spinal cord stimulator.
And this is FDA approved?
Yes.
And you claim that Dr. Farland's SCS
is a minor modification of this?
Yes. That's why we didn't need to submit it to them for approval.
So, then what is this?
That's Dr. Farland's SCS.
So, you're saying
that this is a minor modification of this?
Ira, you can't judge these with a layman's eye.
Medical professionals
who manufactured Dr. Farland's device concluded
that these two devices were similar.
These two?
Yes.
In fact, I anticipated
Mr. Gardner's bringing this issue up again,
so I had a study done
by the respected Benzor Labs in Quantico, Virginia.
What's it say?
That it's a minor modification.
The mediator's on our side.
Yup. Nice job, by the way, but
he still was impressed by this.
Okay, so we have to get someone to say it was vastly modified.
We need Kalinda.
I want to repeat, this is only a precaution.
We are removing all Karpwell cheese from circulation.
Yeah. Gretchen, I'm kind of busy right now. What do you need?
So you're the man behind the cheese,
Eli, is that right?
I'm the...
Who told you that?
An unnamed source.
And what else did this unnamed source tell you?
He said you're crisis managing for the listeria outbreak,
and that you investigated Heather Farms,
and the outbreak's not from there.
...the political revival
of scandal-plagued State's Attorney, Peter Florrick.
He is also known for being a tough infighter.
Though never confirmed, Eli Gold was also thought
to be the architect of an ugly racial attack on his opponent.
So, why is this wholesome brand hiring a spin doctor
known for rehabilitating scandalized politicians?
Are you there, Eli?
Hello.
Eli Gold...
Any comment?
...one of the first political campaign managers
to understand the power of social media...
I'm not part of the story.
Oh. I'm sorry, Eli.
You just became part of the story.
So pull up a chair.
...makes him a highly sought after crisis manager...
It's not all bad, Eli.
It is all bad.
You become the story,
it deflects from your client's guilt.
I become the story, it makes my clients look guiltier.
Who leaked it, Diane?
Eli, it's a fool's game to look for a leaker.
Gretchen knew we checked Heather Farms.
She knew it was clean.
I told two people about that-- you
and Kalinda-- but Gretchen said the leaker was a he.
Did you tell Will?
Oh, he went to the kids' vigil.
I thought you said he was burned.
He was.
You're changing the subjec
I am. So, you tried to un-burn him?
You haven't seen this yet?
Oh, my God.
It's wonderful, isn't it?
People love humility.
Tony Hayward needed a pie in the face.
You didn't.
Oh, set it up? No. That was just luck.
I thought he'd just get booed.
I'm proud to be here today.
I don't care in what condition.
Among those attending the prayer service
was the CEO of Heather Farms, Walter Kermani.
I'm good at my job, Diane,
but I can't have leakers.
It's unprofessional.
Will didn't leak.
So you're here to give up.
Ten million, and we won't accept a penny less.
Really?
You and your lawyer friend cook something up?
It didn't work for you to blame the painkiller.
It didn't work for you to blame the victim,
so minor modification.
That's what your case rests on now.
Dr. Farland's SCS is merely a minor modification
of existing SCSs.
Have some pastrami, Will.
Let's leave all this boring medical talk behind.
The problem is, medicine is a lot like politics.
And all we had to do was follow the money.
She never was jealous, was she?
Your lawyer friend.
That was all a piece of playacting?
Dr. Farland, your man of healing,
invented an SCS to make money.
30% on every device implanted.
Oh. Sorry. Sorry.
Who was that?
Kalinda.
Here's a copy for you.
What is this?
Farland's patent application.
Yeah, I know.
It's a good read, though.
The problem for you is,
Dr. Farland had to insist on its originality.
I get it.
You don't have to lord it over me.
No, I won, so you have to listen.
Dr. Farland had to insist on the originality
of his device to file a patent.
"This SCS is a truly original development
"in severe back pain management.
It is not a mere modification."
How nice of him to use those words.
..."of existing SCSs on the market.
"Therefore, patent.."
I can read.
You're not going to be a sore loser, are you?
Eight million dollars.
Ten. By today.
No.
Eight. That's more than you thought you'd get.
I'll talk to my client.
I need a new home.
You need a...?
New home.
My firm is going under.
Monty & Columbech?
Breaking up.
Litigation's going one way, acquisitions another.
How many in litigation?
Me. Eight other top-flight lawyers.
We need a home.
I'll check with Diane.
I miss you.
Ira?
So, it looks like we'll make a deal.
I heard.
I just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work.
You don't have to thank me.
I wasn't the one who played them.
We...
That's not why we won.
You won because of the facts.
You got your client rich
because you played them... and me.
That's not fair.
It is fair.
It may not be polite, but it is fair.
Don't worry about it.
If I needed a lawyer, I'd probably hire you, too.
Very nice to meet you.
Hey, Mom.
Just wanted to see how you were doing.
How's your thing?
It was good.
I don't know.
I go back and forth on work.
Same with Dad.
I want to do something very old-fashioned.
I want to kiss you on the forehead.
Is that all right?
Sure.
Tucking in is too much.
Right.
Sorry.
Love you.
I'm getting boring.
Getting?
I'm serious.
I used to be... interesting.
I spent the entire day
doing laundry and watching daytime TV.
I saw the clothes.
Thank you.
I mean, when did this happen?
You're the one out having sex with your boyfriend.
Owen...
And I'm the one at home with the kids.
And it's much appreciated.
Are you gonna get hurt by this guy?
I don't know.
I have no perspective.
You should have rebelled in high school.
Then you wouldn't have to do it now.
Is that what this is, rebellion?
Or love.
It's not love, is it?
No.
Good.
