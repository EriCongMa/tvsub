you want some wheel time , kiddo ?
are you serious ?
yeah , come on .
oh my god .
get the kids below deck , right now .
susan ! do it now !
everybody listen to me !
we need to get below deck now !
what are you looking at ?
everybody to the back of the boat ! let &apos;s go !
anybody else for a break ?
let &apos;s go !
move it ! go !
all right , right here .
no , no , no .
shoulder &apos;s too thin , another 20 feet and we &apos;re good .
another 20 feet , i &apos;m gonna be in traction .
what , you want to steer ?
huh ?
do i want to steer ?
no . i don &apos;t want to steer .
i want to continue to push
this three @-@ ton hunk of metal up a hill in 95 @-@ degree weather !
that &apos;s what i want to do .
no , i don &apos;t want to steer . no .
yes , i &apos;ll steer , thank you .
nine miles .
nine miles .
nine miles ! you &apos;ve been working on
your dad &apos;s old wreck for six months ,
and you get nine miles out of it .
i &apos;m very impressed .
this is a classic car , and classic cars are temperamental .
temperamental ?
just like you .
no , no , no . that is an excuse .
that is an excuse
for poor automobile maintenance , my friend .
okay ? this is a car . it is not &quot; temperamental . &quot;
it is a product ! when it stops working , you get another one .
you understand ?
what happened to you , man ?
i mean , where &apos;s your sentimental side ? there &apos;s nothing in there .
i don &apos;t have a sentimental side .
okay ? and if i did , it would be reserved for human beings ,
not dopey machines .
classic machines .
yeah , i know . one person &apos;s classic
is another person &apos;s scrap metal .
well , thank you very much , socrates .
mcgarrett .
you guys need some help ?
he needs help . i just need a lift .
where do you need to be dropped off ?
coast guard station .
according to the tour operator ,
the boat left the dock yesterday afternoon ,
with 12 college kids and two crew on board , out of waikiki .
when it didn &apos;t return , the coast guard
set up a search grid this morning .
when they finally spotted the vessel from the air ,
all the passengers were gone ,
and they saw what looked like two dead bodies up on the deck .
only two ? what happened to the other 12 ?
hey , there she is .
steve .
yeah .
got three gunshot wounds ,
looks like could be automatic weapons .
our second vic took two to the chest .
this guy looks local . could be tongan .
if he is , it could be the work of tongan pirates .
they &apos;re all over the crime bulletins lately
for attacking charter boats up and down the coast .
yeah , i read about that ,
but that &apos;s just random hits-- small boats , sailboats .
i mean , just stick @-@ ups . nobody was ever murdered .
yeah , or grabbed .
remember , we still got 12 passengers that are missing .
but if you &apos;re right , these guys have seriously upped their game .
check it out . captain was strapped .
well , with all the attacks in the news ,
he &apos;d be dumb not to be .
right .
with the bodies falling in the position they did ,
it looks like a firefight .
captain was defending the attack ,
took this guy down with him .
steve . check this out .
what &apos;d you get ?
the four gunmen .
and one boat .
okay , good .
stabilize that image and then enhance it .
see if we can &apos;t get a better look at who did this .
in the meantime , we need to tow this boat to shore ,
let our crime techs do a full sweep .
shh .
everything just happened so fast .
we &apos;re on the boat , and ... next thing you know ,
they &apos;re coming at us out of nowhere .
they were just college kids on spring break .
please tell me they &apos;re not dead .
how did you , uh , how &apos;d you manage to get away , susan ?
uh , they towed us to another boat ,
and they forced everyone onto it .
one of the kids was hurt , so he had to be carried on board .
and when the gunmen were busy doing that ,
i ... slipped below deck .
i feel so horrible because i was trained
to put the passenger first , and ...
you know , i panicked .
i was scared , i wasn &apos;t thinking .
listen , it &apos;s completely normal to be scared
in a situation like that .
susan , the men that attacked the boat ,
can you remember what type of guns they had ?
machine guns , i think .
okay .
i &apos;m going to show you a couple different types of guns ,
you tell me if any of these are familiar , okay ?
that &apos;s it , there .
that &apos;s it , right there ?
yeah .
ak @-@ 47 .
if there &apos;s anything else , anything else at all
that you could think of that &apos;d help us catch these guys ...
while i was hiding , i heard them searching the galley .
so ... i cracked the door a tiny bit ,
and i got a glimpse of one of them .
that the guy ?
the , the guy that i saw was a pacific islander
but he was thinner .
same skin tone ...
it &apos;s not a lot , i know , i just ...
no . it &apos;s enough . it &apos;s perfect .
susan , we &apos;ll find these kids , okay ?
we &apos;ll find the kids .
watch your step .
chin ho kelly .
make sure none of these news crews release any information
that might compromise this case , all right ?
copy .
hey , heads up.heads up .
susan !
no , it &apos;s okay , he &apos;s my fiance .
thank god you &apos;re all right .
thank you .
i stabilized the cell phone footage , but be prepared ...
the quality &apos;s really bad .
i only have a few good frames showing two of the attackers ,
and both of them are wearing ski masks .
but i &apos;m accumulating biometric data ,
so we can run comparisons when a suspect turns up .
nice .
so the hpd pulled the passenger manifest from the tour operator ,
ran their names-- all of them
from the mainland , east coast , college age .
now , some of them went to the same school and flew in together
but there &apos;s no rap sheets ,
no sealed juvie records ,
nothing to show that this wasn &apos;t a random attack .
all right ... i just got off the phone with the fbi .
good news is : kids are still alive .
bad news is : they have been kidnapped .
all right , two hours ago ,
the parents started receiving ransom demands ,
the fbi was called ,
but the governor--smooth-- put the brakes on that .
she wants us running with the case
because we are the ones who caught it .
good . okay , what about this ransom ?
$ 20 million .
yeah . each of the parents received a call
on their cell phone . same exact call .
and , unlike having lunch with you ,
they don &apos;t care how the check is split , they just want the money .
20 mill-- someone knew these kids &apos; parents had money .
yeah , uh , it &apos;s highly likely these guys were targeted .
or our pirates got lucky .
they realized what they had ,
and decided to go for the crazy money .
all right . i want to talk to the parents .
well , the first couple just landed--
they got the call on the west coast .
the other ones are still up in the air .
fine . have hpd bring them in .
in the meantime , we &apos;ll set up
a holding area at the hilton for the other families .
we &apos;ll make sure there &apos;s grief counselors standing by , okay ?
these people are going to land , they &apos;re going to have questions .
let &apos;s get some answers .
listen to me very carefully .
if you want to see your kid alive again ,
you &apos;ll do exactly what we ask .
how do i know you have my daughter ?
how do i know she &apos;s alive ?
daddy ?
josie !
daddy , i &apos;m so scared .
baby , it &apos;s gonna be okay , i promise .
there &apos;s your proof of life .
now get the money , or we &apos;ll send you proof of death .
please . she &apos;s our little girl .
you have to find her .
i will .
i will .
what you doing , bud ?
what are you doing there ?
i &apos;m buying a car . what does it look like i &apos;m doing ?
it looks like you &apos;re doing downward dog ,
but i know you don &apos;t do yoga , so ...
that &apos;s funny .
no , i am stretching because my back hurts .
do you know why my back hurts ?
no , i don &apos;t know . why does your back hurt ?
i &apos;ll tell you why-- it &apos;s because i spent the morning
pushing a car down the pali highway .
oh . oh , where i come from , that &apos;s called good exercise .
oh , really ? where is that , krypton ?
&apos;cause where i come from ,
that &apos;s called a worker &apos;s comp settlement .
big guy , over here , man .
oh , my god .
hey , check him out .
you &apos;re wearing a plastic bag .
you , uh , need some oxygen , babe ?
i &apos;m good .
no , you don &apos;t look good .
you look like you might be dying .
it &apos;s true . you don &apos;t look good .
i &apos;m good . how &apos;d you guys find me ?
we went by your shop .
they told us you were out here .
they &apos;re fired .
when did you start , uh , jogging ?
i &apos;m in training , brah .
did he just say
he &apos;s in a training bra ?
no , he ...
very funny .
i &apos;m training for a sumo competition .
oh . sumo .
sumo .
shouldn &apos;t you be , uh , wearing a diaper ?
big diaper ? something like that ?
it &apos;s called a mawashi , brah .
lip off to me one more time .
i &apos;ll give you a personal introduction to the sport .
i like my odds . bring it .
hey , look , guys , we don &apos;t have time for this .
all right ? come on .
i assume you guys need help .
yes , we do . what do you know about
these local pirates jacking tourists ?
only what i read in the papers .
bunch of tongan bruddahs taking down lightweight scores .
nothing serious .
yeah , well , they just graduated to heavyweight .
they &apos;re now kidnapping and murdering people .
12 kids from the mainland missing just like that .
now their parents are getting hit up
for an eight @-@ figure payday .
which means we &apos;re after a crew that don &apos;t play by the rules .
okay , what @-@ what &apos;s ... why the mysterious looks ?
what &apos;s going ... what do you know ?
couple years ago , there was a kidnapping .
young ... young couple from dubai tied in to big money .
something went wrong at the drop .
couple was killed .
i didn &apos;t believe it then , but ...
word on the street was ...
it was a rogue tongan gang that did the job .
you think there &apos;s any connection ?
you tell us .
i &apos;ll make some calls .
kono .
yeah .
you good at puzzles ?
well , what do you got ?
max just sent over his autopsy results .
both of these vics were killed by gunshot wounds to the chest ,
but their times of death were a day apart .
excuse me ?
all right , let me get this straight , so i understand .
our @-@ our victims were killed at different times ?
yeah , 24 hours apart .
okay , so ... so that means that either max is dead wrong ,
or we are dealing with a tongan pirate zombie .
it &apos;s possible .
no , it &apos;s not possible .
i was kidding .
no , listen . what i &apos;m saying is ,
if our tongan pirate was killed a full day earlier ,
he could have been dumped on the boat .
and ballistics confirm that both vics
were killed by the same gun .
slugs were 7.62 caliber .
ak @-@ 47s use 7.62 &apos;s .
all right , so this means that our tongan victim
could have been killed by his own people , right ?
unless somebody dumped the body
at the scene of the kidnapping to frame them .
okay , good !
so our suspect pool has now expanded
to anybody who has beef with the tongans .
yeah .
oh , that could be half the island , brah .
thank you .
okay .
hey , that was kamekona .
he &apos;s got a lead-- guy named big lono .
he owns a pawn shop in kalihi .
uh , place is being used to move the pirates &apos; stolen merch ,
so if anybody knows where to find these guys ,
it &apos;s going to be big lono .
i don &apos;t know where you got your information from ,
but you &apos;re wrong .
okay . lono ...
understand , please . it &apos;s not about you .
this is about 12 missing kids
and finding the men that kidnapped them .
i don &apos;t know nothing about that .
i run an honest business here .
it &apos;s an honest business . okay .
so , if it &apos;s an honest business , then , please ,
just open this door , huh ?
and so long as we don &apos;t find any stolen merchandise ,
then we will know that you are not doing business
with , uh ... the pirates , and , uh , we &apos;ll be on our way .
forget it .
you see that door ? that &apos;s built to withstand
a 300 @-@ pound samoan meth addict .
so back off before you break a nail , sunshine .
huh . that &apos;s good . how about you open it
or i &apos;ll come over there and i &apos;ll break your face ?
you got some kind of learning disability ?
read my lips .
you , me-- we &apos;re done talking .
is that right ?
look , you seem to be the more rational of the two .
so i &apos;ll say this one more time .
i can &apos;t help you . i &apos;m sorry .
you have five seconds to open the door .
or what ?
one .
what you going to do ?
two .
my cousin &apos;s a lawyer ,
three .
so i know my rights .
four .
and you can &apos;t come in here
without a warrant .
five . time &apos;s up .
you going to open the door ?
not a chance .
okay .
i &apos;ll be back .
&quot; i &apos;ll be back &quot; ? !
that ... he &apos;s done a lot better . trust me .
that &apos;s all you can come up with , is &quot; i &apos;ll be back ? &quot;
i got something . i got something good .
what are you going to do , drive the car through the , uh ... ?
hey ! i got the keys .
quieres llaves ?
you see what you did ?
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s going to do ,
but if i were you , i &apos;d run-- out the back ,
side , roof-- go .
a grenade . he has a grenade .
why do you have a grenade ? he &apos;s got a grenade .
you see this ? you see this ?
he &apos;s not bluffing . he will pull the pin
and blow everybody up .
so will you trust me , please ?
that thing &apos;s not even real .
are you going to open the door ?
not a chance .
okay .
you sure ?
okay .
you &apos;re not bl ... you &apos;re not bluffing .
go . go .
move .
that &apos;s so sick .
come on !
what is the matter with you ?
you need help .
i will pay for it .
why ?
let me see your hands .
what &apos;d i tell you ?
you see how that worked ?
this could have been avoided .
lono , you remember ...
all that hot stuff
that you said you did not have ,
that you assured me that the pirates
did not give to you to sell ?
this--
this gold money clip-- it &apos;s on a police report
of items stolen by the tongan pirates .
now , how do you explain that ? you can &apos;t .
where do we find these guys ?
put your hands till i can see them .
don &apos;t move ! don &apos;t move !
hey , you , shut up .
you freaze !
clear !
secure
backyard clear !
here is secure .
hey , place is clear .
there &apos;s no sign of hostages .
then where the hell are they ?
you should get a close @-@ up on the eyes , cotty .
i need it for a biometric comparison test .
saloni , you kidnapped a couple of kids
off waikiki yesterday . where are they ?
don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , brah .
where are you holding them ?
how about this guy ?
you ever seen him ? huh ?
his name is vai keoni .
he &apos;s my cousin .
who @-@ who killed him ?
why don &apos;t you tell us ?
if i knew , that guy would be dead .
okay .
you want the truth , mcgarrett ?
i rob people .
people who can afford to take the loss .
rich tourists who have no respect for these islands .
i rip them off , but ... i don &apos;t hurt them .
these questions you &apos;re asking me ,
i can &apos;t answer .
i didn &apos;t kill my own cousin ,
and i sure didn &apos;t kidnap any of
these kids you &apos;re talking about .
fine .
when was the last time you saw vai ?
couple of days ago .
he said he got a call from some folks in town .
they said they had a little work for him .
what kind of work ?
didn &apos;t ask .
who hired him ?
didn &apos;t ask .
that &apos;s just the way it goes .
oh , so ...
you pirates have , um ...
like , a piratey code of silence thing ?
hoo @-@ ya .
how about this ?
two people are dead .
12 kids missing .
and i don &apos;t care if you did it or not--
i &apos;m going to make sure you go to prison
and you stay there for the rest of your life . how about that ?
take off my watch .
what ?
take off my watch .
go ahead , take it off .
all right . okay .
my boys and i took it off a deep @-@ sea fishing charter
off the coast of molokai yesterday afternoon .
there is no way we can get from there to waikiki
to kidnap these kids you &apos;re talking ...
how do we know that you ...
it &apos;s engraved , &quot; to my loving husband , bert . &quot;
portly fellow , boston accent ,
weak bladder .
you think this is funny ? huh ?
i &apos;m asking-- you think it &apos;s funny
to put guns in people &apos;s faces ?
look , i &apos;m sure bert filled out a police report by now .
go ahead and check it out , &apos; cause like i said ,
i rob people , mcgarrett ;
i don &apos;t hurt them .
i &apos;m mr. aloha , and i &apos;m not going to go down
for something that i didn &apos;t do , my bruddah .
no matches .
great , so none of the guys we busted
attacked that boat yesterday .
unless maybe the guys we caught on the video footage
weren &apos;t in the house when we hit it .
or maybe it confirms my theory that this is a frame job .
that is the second time you said that .
all right , you really think
someone cloned the pirates &apos; m.o. ?
look , everything the kidnappers needed to know
was in the eyewitness report printed in the newspaper .
all they had to do was copy what the real pirates did
and send us on a wild goose chase .
and they left us a body
to lead us to saloni and his crew .
if you are right ,
it means whoever grabbed these kids
are a lot smarter than we thought .
not smart enough apparently , because we figured them out .
hey , steve .
yeah , the parents got here .
any word ? anything ? please ?
ladies and gentlemen ,
we &apos;ll answer all your questions , i promise .
my name is lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett .
i run the five @-@ 0 task force
for the state of hawaii .
and along with the honolulu police department ,
i want to assure you that we are doing
absolutely everything possible to find your children .
we &apos;re hearing that you have some people in custody .
is that true ?
we do have some suspects in custody right now .
if they &apos;re in custody ,
then where are our children ?
at this point , we have no evidence
linking these men to what happened .
it &apos;s been two days since it happened .
i know .
they &apos;re just kids .
who knows what these people are doing to them .
look , if you don &apos;t know where they are ,
why don &apos;t you just let us pay the ransom
and we can bring our kids home .
that would be a bad idea , sir , mr ...
brown .
mr. brown .
morris brown .
and this is my son ... justin .
mr. brown , all of you ,
what &apos;s very important right now is that you &apos;re patient
in a situation like this .
we will find your kids .
but you must understand that nothing positive
will be gained by paying this ransom , okay ?
i &apos;ve handled many kidnapping cases personally .
and one misstep from any one of us ,
this can end very , very badly .
i think you &apos;re wrong . you &apos;re wrong .
this is just a piece of business for these guys .
they &apos;re just in it for the money .
and if that &apos;s what brings our kids back ,
i say let them have it .
what i need you all to do right now ...
is to trust us .
just like all of you ,
i &apos;ve been on the other end of that call .
and believe me , i understand , it is the worst feeling ,
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s the worst feeling in the world .
but right now , you need to be strong , okay ?
you need to be strong for your kids ,
and you need to let us handle this .
as soon as we know something significant ,
you will be the first to hear .
you have my word .
so what you &apos;re really saying is y @-@ you don &apos;t know anything .
what are the real chances of getting these kids back alive ?
when my father was kidnapped , i knew from prior experience
that no matter what move i made on that day ,
the results were not gonna be good .
okay ? i mean , these situations ,
they rarely are .
we &apos;re gonna change that .
we &apos;re gonna get these kids back .
we &apos;re gonna get them back alive .
turns out , saloni &apos;s alibi checks out .
that watch he had was taken two days ago
from a tourist on a fishing charter .
description matches saloni and his men .
oh , look at that , a crook who tells the truth .
yeah , really .
what you got ?
all right , so i ran a system check
on the kidnapped kids since they arrived on the island .
credit card charges , phone calls , that sort of thing .
couple things stood out .
one , none of them showed any sort of payment
for the actual cruise .
well , unless each of them paid in cash , right ?
according to the tour operator , all 12 tickets were purchased
by one person , and he paid in cash .
one person . was it one of the kids ?
no . the tour operator said he was older .
hat , sunglasses-- didn &apos;t give us much to go on .
also found another thing
interesting in the kids &apos; credit card charges .
so some of them stayed at different hotels
and ate at different restaurants .
the one thing they all had in common
was that they had a bar tab at a club called storm
the afternoon before the kidnapping .
according to the credit card companies ,
they also spent some money there today .
all right .
that means that whoever made those charges
stole their credit cards .
and can help lead us to the kidnapped kids .
four @-@ year college tuition : $ 200,000 .
books and supplies : 5,000 .
room and board : 25,000 .
passing out with two cocktail olives up your nose ...
priceless .
hey . i &apos;m sorry , but , uh , i &apos;m gonna have to i.d. you .
yeah , no problem .
oh , you &apos;re good , partner .
what &apos;s your name ?
moku .
anyone else work at the bar with you today , moku ?
just bobby and me .
that &apos;s a good trick .
i don &apos;t know anything about any missing kids .
why &apos;d you run ?
you served these kids drinks two days ago , didn &apos;t you ?
let me guess .
you kept an imprint of the credit cards ,
ran some charges today and kept the cash .
listen to me real carefully , bobby .
credit card fraud is six months probation ,
kidnapping is life ; you do the math .
you got to believe me ,
i had nothing to do with kidnapping those kids .
kono .
yeah . you got something ?
moku thinks he remembers
something from the day the kids were here .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , maybe .
there was this guy , a little bit older than
the rest of the crowd .
i remember him because he snuck into the vip section ,
said he had some promotional thing .
security ended up kicking him out , but
other than that , it was just your ordinary
out of control spring break party .
those work ?
yeah , boss put them in last year
to make sure we carded everyone .
you didn &apos;t card my cousin .
yeah , man , about that ...
yeah , yeah , yeah . at least you didn &apos;t call me her father .
hey , moku , we &apos;re gonna need to see
the security tapes from two days ago .
sure thing .
i think we found one of our kidnappers .
so , here we have our kidnapped kids , all 12 of them ,
dancing , buying drinks , having fun .
then there &apos;s this guy .
perfect match .
we ran his face through the system , didn &apos;t get any hits .
what &apos;s he doing at the club ?
uh , well , at first ,
he &apos;s just at the bar watching the kids .
and then we have him approaching them
in the vip section .
what &apos;s he giving them ?
passes to the catamaran cruise .
we sent his picture over to the tour operator ;
he thinks this is the guy that bought all 12 tickets in cash .
he targeted these kids .
he put them on that boat to be kidnapped .
it &apos;s a smart play , actually .
if you &apos;re a kid behind the velvet ropes of the vip section ,
chances are , you got a mommy or daddy
who can , uh , afford to pay a big fat ransom .
it &apos;s mcgarrett .
steve , this is sergeant lukela .
someone just called into hpd asking to talk to
the person running the investigation .
we got him on hold .
okay , patch them through .
run a trace .
patching through now .
who is this ?
lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett .
what kind of game do you think you &apos;re playing , cop ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m talking about the money .
you think i didn &apos;t know these parents would go to the cops ?
i expected that .
what i did not expect
is for you to be playing with their kids &apos; lives .
now where &apos;s the rest ?
okay , hang on-- we @-@ we haven &apos;t paid any money .
we gave very simple instructions , and you blew it .
you had to test us , didn &apos;t you ?
listen to me , all right ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking ...
enough !
enough games .
all right , listen , calm down .
okay , calm down ,
let &apos;s talk about this .
killing people is not gonna get you that money , you understand ?
oh , it &apos;s too late for that .
what are you talking about ?
what &apos;d you do ?
hey , what did you--
what the hell have you done ?
i &apos;m gonna call you again directly
in one hour , with new instructions .
i suggest you follow them exactly this time .
did you get that ?
got him .
he &apos;s calling from sand island .
danny !
no .
oh , man .
justin ...
god , no .
please .
no , please .
mrs. brown ...
justin &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s dead .
we &apos;re very , very sorry .
you see ? !
he &apos;s dead because of you !
no , don &apos;t .
he &apos;s dead !
after you left , all the parents got calls on our cell phones
from the kidnappers . they wanted to know
if we had the money .
all the other parents wanted you to handle it .
i just wanted justin back .
so i put 400,000 bucks cash in a backpack .
i thought if i gave this guy something ,
he &apos;ll at least let justin free .
so i dropped off the cash .
i came back here just like he told me .
we thought that was my boy--
knocking on the door .
oh , god , what have i done ?
what have i done ?
so ballistics ran the slug they pulled out of justin .
matches the same ones that
they got out of the boat captain and the pirate .
hey , boss , how long before the kidnapper
calls back with the instructions ?
less than a minute .
what are you going to do ?
that &apos;s him .
here .
you didn &apos;t have to kill the kid .
no , but i did get your attention , didn &apos;t i ?
listen to me . you think you &apos;re going to get away with this ?
it &apos;s a small island . i &apos;m going to find you .
i don &apos;t think so , steve .
you have one hour to get the money together
or the remaining hostages die .
there will be a bus full of kids
parked in a location that i will give you
the address to , next time i call .
once you deliver the money ,
we &apos;ll all go to the honolulu airport .
make sure there &apos;s a private plane , fully fueled ,
and ready to go .
once my associates and i are on the plane
the hostages will be released .
you never mentioned a plane , okay ?
i need more time .
you don &apos;t have it . one hour .
okay .
i &apos;ll be there .
no , no , you won &apos;t be there .
you think i &apos;m walking into a trap ?
who do you want to deliver the money ?
make it the girl from the paper this morning .
the one that got away last time .
okay , she &apos;s a civilian .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
i will drop the money personally . i &apos;ll be unarmed .
you have my word , okay ?
no cops . i smell a setup , the kids die , understand ?
susan makes the exchange by herself .
listen , i can &apos;t let her do that .
you don &apos;t understand-- you don &apos;t have a choice .
she &apos;s the only one i know
who &apos;s definitely not a cop .
i need more time .
you have 59 minutes .
you want to waste any more talking to me ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
did you get him ?
he dropped the call before we got him .
okay , hpd might have a look @-@ alike
we could send in undercover .
no , no . we don &apos;t have time .
and they burn her as a cop , and the kids are dead .
you &apos;re not seriously considering using susan , are you ?
she &apos;s the only one who can do this job .
i don &apos;t understand . why do they want me to do this ?
because the kidnappers saw you in the paper .
they know you &apos;re not a cop .
listen , i understand that
what we &apos;re asking of you is scary , okay ?
if i could do this myself , i would , but i can &apos;t .
the fact is , if you don &apos;t help us with this ,
these kids are going to end up dead .
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , the news said
they already killed one of the kids . is that true ?
yeah , it is .
his name was justin brown .
he was 19 years old .
susan , listen to me , okay ?
the money &apos;s right here .
unfortunately , you &apos;re the only chance
that these parents have of seeing their kids alive again .
these people-- they killed your friend .
susan , this is your chance to do something about that .
what if i make a mistake ?
i &apos;ll be right there . we &apos;ll all be right there , okay ?
i promise you that .
this is them .
i need an answer .
susan , i need an answer .
okay .
i &apos;ve got your money .
there &apos;s a warehouse at 44 industrial way .
have the girl walk the money in .
she &apos;ll return on the bus with the rest of the hostages
and be released at the airport .
you have 15 minutes .
get up .
get up !
it looks like the hostages are already on the bus .
we &apos;ve got movement in the warehouse and guns .
assuming it &apos;s the kidnappers .
okay , so that &apos;s ...
we &apos;ll be listening to what &apos;s going on
around you and this earpiece will allow you
to hear everything we say .
can you hear me through it okay ?
okay .
we &apos;ll be there if anything goes wrong , okay ?
you can do this , susie .
you &apos;re going to be fine . we got your back , okay ?
you &apos;re going to be fine .
all right .
all right , susan ,
just do exactly as they say .
this will be all over before you know it .
told you this would work .
hey , susan , you really think i was going to let you
just walk in there with all that money ?
what the hell ? !
where is it ? !
move !
hey , hey ! chin .
i got them . go !
on the ground now !
drive . right now !
he &apos;s got a gun !
how &apos;d you know she was in on it ?
the guy i talked to-- he called susan by her name ,
and he said he saw her picture in the newspaper .
except her name was never listed in the newspaper .
