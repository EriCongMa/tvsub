Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve,
What? You mentioning
I don't know what you're talking about. Alright I'll see you back then
I mean, you've been locked up for 30 years.
30 years,
This is harassment.
You're in prison.
$100,000 bribe that day.
42-30? 42-30, come in.
42-30. Copy that.
Go for 42-30.
on a fence released from prison six months ago.
Angela was bumped from the flight
Angela probably set Mary up,
Angela's going to be killed.
if I don't do exactly what he says.
Where's Angela?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe
August March. HPD.
August March?
Nothing moved on or off Honolulu
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks
Okay, uh, Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
Danny, it's not a bike path.
Danny, call Kono, have her pick Mary up
Hey, I've been thinking about these diamonds.
Jordan Nevins.
All the outbound calls
Okay, Kono, tell me something good.
Okay, Kono, get the governor on the phone.
March was telling me he thinks
Mary, this happens to all of us.
Mary, we need to determine
Mary's been arrested.
30 minutes before Mary was arrested.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Mary didn't make that plane.
had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation.
that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
Commander McGarrett, your sister
Commander McGarrett.
Mr. March.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Steve, I really screwed up.
No, I'm good, thank you.
Ah, that's good to keep in mind.
It is, it's true.
All right, well, what-what now?
Per the watch commander,
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
Put him back in his cage.
Give him to me. Just give him to me. No!
Okay, okay! Would you slow down, please?

Just helping his brother?
the kidnapper's accent. Exactly.
had about $20 million worth of diamonds
in the Protective Custody Wing, right?
Sorry to disappoint you,
that she got arrested two months ago
Got sidetracked by this case.
Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
better than I hoped.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
Pretty sweet. Right?
Just the players do.
never turn your back on the buyer.
Now don't be fooled by the way he looks.
No kidding.
and stop over analyzing things.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
don't show much.
but tell her I want it done low-key.
and how you ended up with these diamonds.
and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
a room key, and nobody saw her with another woman.
He had an accent.
struggle, or a girl named Angela.
No. Nobody.
No, I didn't run background
out of the blue like that? No.
Very good. Okay, and if we can flip him,
not Five-O's.
but nothing as large as this.
But it's all good stuff, so don't worry.
But there's one more thing you need to learn
But with your help, this actually worked out
but since you've killed
Sorry, brah.
lay eyes on me again.
but it's just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it.
the minute you got away from him?
No...
don't ya? Huh?
That's not going to happen, Mary.
Wasn't European, but similar.
No, I'll get your ve... Uh, Chin?
Sorry. Maybe I just don't get it.
Doesn't mean he's not dirty.
Guess you could call it that.
in, like, three days.
Okay,
a conflict diamond.
for me to prepare a press release
with the exception
You learn from your mistakes.
From jail? Why? What does he get out of it?
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary
Excuse me.
Stop. Push in.
No, you're wrong, okay?
Well, most people like to start the day off
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
It was reported stolen last night.
But if they were always gonna steal the diamonds,
But...
But...
but maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video,
but please stop driving this car
But if I help you,
but she never actually checked in.
but he knew everything about me.
But there were plenty of cops
But he said he wanted to fence...
But the part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know
but then we figured what's the use?
But I did confirm that Mary has a co-worker
but it doesn't... it doesn't make sense to me.
but with what you've been handling lately,
right?-- and he lied to me,
Until then, I'm going on the assumption
When the guy there approaches her and takes possession
when you meet your new cell mate,
when you drop in on someone's wave,
"When you land, walk directly to baggage carousel three.
Yes! It's the coolest job ever.
Yeah.
All right, well, I'm gonna charge you
Okay.
Come on. Seriously.
of the evidence van hijacker, okay?
on the coffee. -Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute. You ran background on my sister?
Wait, you can't do that.
Excuse me. Come on, Vince.
Number two: I clearly told the guy
on your sister; TSA did,
the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.

You understand me? You understand me?
be referred to as a pupu.
all of the diamonds like I told you.
that are on the island
What does it say?
Right? That's the only way that they would have known
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I said, "Hey, buddy, I'm on the wave!"
This is the first time for the both of us.
with the death of those two cops.
Thank you.
Well, as I told you on the phone,
Eh, don't worry.
for the murder of your ex-partner. I know who he is.
but not the new chief of detectives, huh?
And according to the hotel records,
And besides, this guy matches the description
and unlike you guys,
and he told me that Angela's dead
and he told me that he's going to text his partner,
battle training, anyway.
and she knew I need a job, so here I am.
Relax, kid.
Yeah, really.
Plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
Relax? That's funny coming from you.
to make a big score.
Just confirmed he's staying in the penthouse suite.
of carbon formed at high pressure
What was that?
announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.
He told him the description of the van,
And tell me how you got away from this guy
that tells me that if that press release hits,
I have something I have to show you, if you got a minute.
She's on every country's watch list.
gives us enough-- more than enough--
Can't trace it.
You finish making that call...
about this type of business.
I checked through Interpol.
come on over here a second.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past!
So, what was the plan?
Hey!
Hey.
The airline gave us her cell phone number,
just so there's no confusion, this is HPD's handle,
Okay, well, holding back the fact
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath,
Okay, but you do know people
Okay, what?
Okay, all right, good. Take Mr. March over to Fong's,
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
Okay, well, can you describe this guy to me?
All right, what are you getting at?
All right, well, good. That's a good start.
Okay.
Okay.
Well...
Okay, no, no, no. Do what you want to do. Be paranoid.
Okay, well, I-I think that the same rules
All right, so if you're gonna start looking for the hijacker,
Okay, maybe, maybe.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped,
Yeah, well, I certainly
Okay, we don't know who made the call,
Okay, well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen
Okay, who's this one to?
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. He was tall.
Okay.
All right, when you get those diamonds,
Okay, listen... OFFICER: Detective Kelly?
Okay, that's good. How?
Okay. Do we have a positive I.D.?
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night,
All right, where's Angela?
Okay, go nuts. Let your mind
Okay, no problem.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.
Okay, all right, this is crazy.
Okay, well,
Okay.
You pick yourself up.
Okay.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way
All right.
All right, that's number one.
Nice shot, Fryer.
Good news is, they still have no idea
Why bother lying?
you're gonna feel safer in here with us
and she doesn't exist, right?
in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
a little closer to my sister than you were
Black helicopters are real.
Okay. You know, Williams...
Hey, you okay?
Hey, look, you're not done. You're not.
Hey, look, he's capable of killing cops.
Hey. Hey, look,
Hey... dead man walking.
Guys, listen, I think
I'm sorry.
I'm delighted you reached out to me, Angela.
Surprise.
babbling about black helicopters.
Here we go.
are tossing my place or did you just miss me?
and they got a bullet for it.
Okay, and why would you not call me
And she's the one that helped me get this job.
that are in that business, correct?
It's butter cream.
won't answer your questions...
Brings too much heat.
Bribe a judge? What?
Either way, you're gonna answer my questions, because...
from the TSA's custody, and drop her in my office,
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
If they are still on the island.
plan-- but what if, what if we get Mary
If these guys just came in possession
seen him before? Yes, I'm positive.
You weren't home, so I figured
See Detective Williams for an evidence transfer.
Call that guy back.
And is that unusual-- to get a call
She helped me get this job.
She just didn't want to get killed doing it.
She is not on the plane, so, we're gonna have a big problem
She won't talk to anyone else.
that she's telling me the truth.
She reached out to him with an opportunity
how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's not smart enough
She's gonna try to fence those diamonds.
Where she lands,
She refused to talk to us.
The guy could have used the pass key. Yeah, well,
She's his ex-old lady.
She's based out of New York and isn't due
Did she say why she had the diamonds?
And when she does, Interpol and the FBI
She's in the wind.
you guys all stopped talking
Earlier today, we got a tip
Move in!
going in or out of that specific room.
Surprise!
What the hell happened?
he's not doing so good. He's dead.
we parted ways.
then we can roll back and arrest whoever's holding Angela.
By yourself, right?
That's the guy Mary described.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
We work together as flight attendants.
is you and me are gonna get rich.
So... so, you guys are, like, surf buddies now, huh?
So we are kind of surf buddies now?
about the Liberian smuggling operation in the first place.
They're real.
that I'm not that easy to surprise.
Now! Move out!
We met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
As I said before...
serving his sentence six months ago.
are gonna be waiting for her.
While we're on the subject,
at the airport?
Based on quality,
He's definitely surprised.
Please slow down. I'm asking you nicely.
with some pleasantries,
should never, never, under any circumstances,
Look at him.
it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
It looks like you're, uh,
That look familiar?
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
Look what we got here.
Cuff him.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.
maybe just not telling us the full story.
to scare her into doing it.
and there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Come here.
Come on. That's a young man's game.
comes from Africa.
bargaining chip for Angela's life. All right.
okay, and calm down, all right?
the Republic of Liberia.
two more cops,
Maybe a little of both.
Pick up your board, Danny.
that makes zero sense.
Yeah, that was my father. Yeah.
Yes.
Nobody said you were dumb.
You got it.
I didn't know your sister was in town.
Nothing. No parole.
No. Don't think so.
No, no.
that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
There's no reports of any diamond shipments this size,
Maybe she met somebody who was.
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
TSA security line.
named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
You understand?
Well, so far, we have no signs of a forced entry,
Getting my vest.
that guy pulls out that gun,
Where's the girl?
The other girl was my sister.
that would make sense, right?
they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today.
All right, see you later. -Okay.
So, was there anyone new
So a stewardess.
So we'll catch up next time.
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
Let's make 'em worry about us.
That is when we move in. DARRYL: You sure you can
That's the arrest signal.
I tried to offer him...
It's usually a rival group trying
Okay, look, we're going to check that hotel room,
who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
move this kind of weight?
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingie?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
All right, listen, as a professional courtesy,
Well, you'll be happy to know
Well, then that would explain
Wow.
of the product. Y-You did bring
You've been played.
you've got to give me your word
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough
You just got here.
You were gonna use
you gotta protect me
you start with HPD.
there's something about your body language right now
That was your birthday cake.
What do you mean?
the moves you've been making,
Your diamonds.
You know, it's funny,
your share of the dough to make an appeal?
maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are..
What you just said, coupled with the phone records
you give me the guys
Any relation?
Hello, Mary.
to your brother. Okay, so then you know she was arrested
You and my sister Mary did.
you are going to be wearing a tinfoil hat,
that either you or Angela had met?
...you will never, never
Why don't you just take it easy?
you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
You can't own a wave.
is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
you cause problems for other surfers.
you could've handpicked the best one. I didn't.
You two have
Is there a reason you two
If you two are done draining each other emotionally,
You don't think so? No, I-I know so.
You okay? Yeah.
your friend before this? Yes.
There you guys are.
You guys have been acting weird.
What were you guys talking about?
when I came in the office this morning?
What are you talking about?
You seized some diamonds?
People like you get killed.
You understand? Like, I'm trying to put this thing together,
You-you can't...
that you lost their diamond shipment.
Are you sure? Things change.
Are you sure you have the right person?
You're making the waiter nervous.
You've kept me waiting.
How long have you known Angela?
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing?
You planted that. It ain't mine.
You're positive you've never
Have you tried next door?
you're the first to get shot.
It's a very colorful, but less-than-accurate description
You say you're not dumb,
What are you talking about-- "Charade"?
What do you mean, they're real?
Why don't you pull it back a little bit?
Why do you keep asking me that?
You sensitive right now?
You're working for the airlines?
you're going straight back to jail.
Did I hear right, that your name's McGarrett?
Your brother...
You got new leverage on him?
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You ever mention my daughter again...
Are you, uh... are you staying in town
You already know that,
You should be walking the main line
that you'll never bother me again.
You got a kid, right?
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
You lie to me again,
Are you implying that he's involved with this?
What are you doing?
Is this a joke?
than you are out there on the street.
What are you doing here, Mary?
How'd you know about the cops?
Have you ever seen this guy before?
you know, last time I saw you...
You know, last time I checked,
Did you know?
...you do know that the only people
You do know that that
going to a Halloween party
the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
Oh, okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
Oh, believe me, the pleasure's all mine.
He had dark skin.
Cha cha cha
Cha cha cha
Well, you should never surprise a man
Ex-cop.
he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
Okay, are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Please! We're not gonna be able to help anybody
Be my guest.
No offense, but I think I'm
Take a seat.
that Mary had the diamonds on her.
in the world.
and a promise of no deportation.
And afterwards, I can tell your bosses
And your brother turned to you for advice?
and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Which leads me to believe that is is probably...
Let me guess, you had already told
I'm starting to think you are.
who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
It's not extensive.
without August March taking a piece of the action.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
that I care to recognize.
If March gets compromised,
If anybody else wants to ride it with me, they're welcome.
Because if not, anything happens,
If there really isn Angela. Danny, she's my sister.
And if that doesn't happen...
If I'm not on that plane
If you lay a finger on me,
you needed a man's invitation
If I could look at this stone
If I tell you everything,
If somebody's on the wave first, they own the wave.
If there's a deal this big going down,
30 years... Well,
that killed my men...
What was what?
Yeah.
life is going to get very interesting.
birthdayoy. Happy birthday, buddy.
What do you mean? Well, the kidnappers said
The diamond?!
All right, well, the rest of the security videos
for a while? -Actually, no.
I did, actually. Can I have a cup of coffee, too?
Small world. How's he doing?
Can't blame a guy for trying.
Well, it's working.
I know, but I have to go back to the hotel
Yeah. And it tells a whole lot.
Yeah. Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
I know, but I thought she was my friend.
Yeah, little bit.
It is, isn't it?
You know, I finally felt like
who would've taken that money, right, Chief?
Isn't that true?
Yeah, but these guys killed two cops to get these stones,
Yeah, uh...
Okay, that's him.
Yes. Do you know anything about it?
Yeah, I do,
Right, and as far as brokers go, there's only
Yeah.
In a good way.
In a good way.
around him
Yeah?
So what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
How exactly did that happen?
knows who's responsible, okay?
That's him.
from a stranger.
Uh, well, my friend Angela worked for the airlines,
Cell phone.
Who gave it to you? - It was an anonymous tip.
All right, who would have known something about that?
who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
Whoever sent you to me knows that. Good.
Okay, who's Angela?
And, by the way, we like
How's she doing, anyway?
He had a deep voice.
I honestly don't even know what to do with myself.
Why are you really here? I know you're looking for something.
All clear.
Well, I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
Okay.I saw a wave, I rode it.
And that's why, if I were you,
so, yeah, I think we got the right person.
So, this guy's been off the radar since he finished
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested
therefore was not raised with all the mumbo jumbo.
back to New York, so I got to take a rain check
So tell me...
so no one can see him.
the route, so they could hijack it.
So here I am.
That's why we called you.
and we are here to prove that-- that's what we're gonna do.
so there's no actual footage of anyone
so when the diamonds didn't get there,
off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl...
the overall quality
He taped the diamonds to me,
He's in a life term.
He's strapped. Butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
continued long after he was in prison
His name's Darryl Kaleo.
All right? This guy's done his time.
for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
He's easy to find.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
he can identify where the diamonds are from.
they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
They had to, uh,
They only have coverage of the stairwell,
than they were of us.
so they know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
They said salt cake, I said, "What's the plan?"
and they gave me the Oahu to New York run.
of 20 million in ice, they need to move it through a broker.
They know you're a victim in all this.
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
They made the mistake of trusting him,
He'll do fine.
He landed on the island three days ago.
He was a good man.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
He's dead.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating, you understand?
He's also in prison. That's right.
he'll have heard about it.
He was in my room waiting.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone,
So cute.
and high temperature conditions.
You understand?
Listen to me. I thought I knew my brother--
Take it from me, someone who was not born on this island,
Look, Angela's gonna resurface eventually.
Listen, Kaleo,
Hey, look, no way in hell.
Listen, um,...
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
Look,
We can hang out during my layovers.
on smuggling some contraband
like it's stolen, and slow down!
Wow. Here you go,
You move on.
and used to finance civil wars
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know
Why'd they just, uh...
why'd they run out of here so quick?
Why didn't you call me?
why wouldn't they just snatch Mary when she arrived
Why's that? Killing cops?
why these diamonds were never reported missing.
to get this girl back safe.
on one of the unrecorded lines
Hey! Where's Angela?
Hey, look at the time stamp.
Hey, hey!
Hey. So the room hasn't been serviced, so it should be
Hey.
Hey.
I'm-I'm sorry .
I-I don't know...
I could've picked you up from the airport.
I'm not worried. I'm really happy for you.
I don't... maybe. Just tell me again.
I'm not just talking about you.
I can't believe
I'm not in that business anymore.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
I broke a couple of bones in your face, right?
I was planning on taking it by the office.
Of course, I believe you. Mary, just slow down.
'Cause I was terrified.
and that when I land,
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
I'd check your favorite little surf spot.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
The murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on.
Oh, my God.
Which means we got
Butter cream's my favorite.
I'm sure your prints are gonna be all over it.
I'll bet my job none of my guys are involved.
I would say...
I told your partner I was too old for this.
I spoke to the airline.
I will play along.
I doubt if Angela would... double-cross me.
I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys,
I told you about her, didn't I?
I'd like to speak to my sister in private.
It's been a pleasure.
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
"I'll be watching, so don't try and involve the cops,
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
All right, I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I will have the consulate crawling so far up your...
I'm a facilitator.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
I will also remember that.
I got a visual, 10:00. Right now. 10:00.
I got him.
What does it look like I'm doing here?
I might.
It is?
I'm here for one piece of business.
I started like two weeks ago,
I'll be right there.
I'm working the return flight
I don't have time for your games. - No, no.
I didn't have many options.
I'm not saying she's lying,
I didn't get away.
We were gonna jump out and yell surprise,
We need to talk.
we have a microscope for you to look at, okay?
We need to get a look at this security film.
We got any, uh... got any other contact info?
nine hours to save your friend.
then we're going to know more.
We get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time.
and we will get an I.D. On her kidnapper.
I mean, people we think we can trust tell us lies.
we can use them as a
We didn't have a choice.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
if we end up wrapped around a telephone pole.
We're all good.
to be called flight attendants. -I knew that.
We need to ask you a few questions.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go
We need to find this Angela. Yes.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey. We'll find her.
We came from New York together. Okay, so she was
we should just face the fact,
But we got footage of Angela
After our little charade at the hotel,
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help
All we're trying to do is prevent
with the smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
we know that you helped set this thing up,
I'm in this mess now.
I feel so stupid.
My daughter is doing fine.
I was coming down on his left.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
This is McGarrett.
I'm a Liberian citizen.
I mean, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
I mean... Now, look, I just did what I had to do, all right?
I said please don't do it, please...
For all I know,
I'm too old for that kind of thing. Come on.
I agree.
for not believing Mary's story,
I wish I could help you more.
I... I liked that job.
Well, I think you should relax, maybe,
You have my word.
I promise you I'm gonna come back here,
I don't know. Stuff. General stuff.
I have no idea.
Neither did I. Hi.
I can't estimate
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Come on.
Driving like I always do.
I tried.
I'm doing life without,
I cleaned house.
of what I was convicted of.
I already tried that. The angles are bad.
I've already been briefed on the kidnapping case.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I've got 200 more of that same quality.
I got plan-- it might be a goofy
I got the connections.
or I'm gonna file a complaint!
I'm a student of the game.
