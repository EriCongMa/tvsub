on my dad &apos;s girlfriends in the past ...
i know you stole my dad &apos;s credit card , margot .
hit the damn road .
i don &apos;t have a car .
find one .
i was the one who had to pick up the pieces
when his heart got broken .
besides , to hear my dad talk ,
it sounds like he has really found someone who ...
is good for him .
and you believe that ?
your dad has terrible taste in women .
that &apos;s why i love him so much .
remember the one who pretended to be a paraplegic ?

oh , whatever .
that &apos;s the last one i met ,
and i &apos;m lucky he &apos;s letting me meet this one .

didn &apos;t she ... ?
yes . she sexually intercoursed my high school boyfriend
george jiang underneath the bleachers .
while you were sitting ...
yes !
while i was sitting on those bleachers .
have you ever seen sex from above , cece ?
it &apos;s horrible . that &apos;s why god thinks it &apos;s a sin .
also , trashley gave him giardia in his belly ring .
giardia is a river disease .
she had river mouth .
wasn &apos;t george jiang , like , six @-@ 11 ?
yeah . they called him george jiang the giardia giant ,
and i never got to hold him in my arms .
what are you gonna do ? !
uh ... nothing .
i &apos;m gonna be sweet and kind and supportive .
look , peop @-@ peop ... people change .

there were rumors flying around about every damn one .
you remember the rumor about me ?
oh , that you shaved your chin ?
what ?
was that the rumor about me ?
that was the rumor .
no . it was ...
definitely sexier than that .
thank you guys for coming . it &apos;s really helpful that you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m trying to get my boss to give me the new account .
i just have to figure out how to sell sponges to men .
what do i have ?
i have a blood @-@ stained idea notebook
filled with terrible ideas .
i don &apos;t know what to do , you guys .
damn it !
&quot; spongey make wipey . &quot; i like that .
okay , please . i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
this is what we &apos;re gonna do . i &apos;m gonna say the word &quot; sponge , &quot;
and you guys are gonna say the first word that pops
into your head , okay ?
ready , one , two , three . sponge .

yellow .

that was mine .
okay , let &apos;s just try this .
we &apos;re gonna try this one more time .
okay ? just clear your head , okay ?
so i &apos;m gonna say the word , and you &apos;re gonna say
the first word that pops in your head .
okay , it might be &quot; sponge . &quot; don &apos;t say &quot; sponge . &quot;
sponge !
sponge .
damn it ! focus !
i &apos;m sorry . okay , let &apos;s just try it again .
give me a shot . give me a shot . give me a shot .
i &apos;m gonna say &quot; sponge &quot; one more time , first word

we all know that men are idiots .
how long have you been in my office ?
but what we don &apos;t know is how much they love to clean .
you &apos;re wasting my time , schmidt . go .
come on , gina , you have to give me this account .
you want to market sponges to men .
i &apos;m the only man in the office .
oh , speaking of . sherri , you got the sponge account !
touchdown ! yeah .
just hear me out here .
the reason why men don &apos;t talk
about how much they love to clean is
because they &apos;re afraid to admit it .
give me a chance here .
be the one to put schmidt on the map .
let &apos;s blast america right in the face
with a little bit of schmidt .
god in heaven ! fine !
put together a focus group , okay ?
i will do that . this is exciting .
all right . maybe next week
we &apos;ll start it ?
no . today , 3 : 00 .
today ... today at 3 : 00 ?
today at 3 : 00 ?
mm @-@ hmm .
3 : 00 today-- that sounds great .
i love that idea .
mm @-@ hmm , you just ... you just earned a special thank you
in my autobiography .
working title : punting the sweet fantastic .
i feel like you kind of have to do something
to write a book about yourself .
sports !
oh , it &apos;s just so great to see you guys again .
will you please remind me ?
were you there my first senior year or my second ?
i was not good at high school .
oh , the early 2000s .
god , i did so much e.
just doing e , watching that show ed .
i would love to know how you two lovers met .
oh , yeah !
oh , yeah , sure .
okay , so i was listening
to him sing with his band , the co @-@ pays .
yeah , well ...
i didn &apos;t know you were in a band , dad .
yeah , just @-@ just me and a few other pharmacists .
you know , we do alt rock covers .
oh , man , when he started singing &quot; she &apos;s so high ... &quot;
* she &apos;s so high ... *
stop . because i &apos;m gonna fall in love again .
okay , go , i want to .
* she &apos;s so high ... *
oh . oh , man .
that was it . i was done .
ashley , have you kept in touch with our dare officer ?
oh ! cece .
oh . okay , i @-@ i get it .
you guys heard about that rumor
that i had sex with the dare officer ?
no ! only a crazy person ...
that rumor was true .
crazy fun person .
oh , yeah , that guy .
wow , i did not just say no .
i said yes .
oh , yeah .
i just said , &quot; yes , yes , yes . &quot;
oh , she said yes a lot .
she &apos;s had sex with hundreds of guys .
yeah . you know , we spent some time trying
to total them all up .
it was fun .
killed a whole saturday .
yeah .
we couldn &apos;t even get through the list .
we got to the &quot; ls . &quot;
but that was in the past .
and then i was diagnosed with a sex addiction .
oh , great .
thankfully ,
i attended rehab .
which ... did not take the first time .
or the second .
but third time &apos;s the charm .
for a lot of people . not for me .
for me , it took four . four times .
well , bobby , we should get ready to go to the beach .
okay .
yeah .
thank you so much for this delicious brunch , jess .
it was wonderful .
i ate so much , i &apos;m gonna have to bang nine guys
just to work it off .
oh , my goodness .
i &apos;m kidding . i did do that once ,
but i &apos;m not gonna do it this time .
it &apos;s all in the past for me .
isn &apos;t she great ?
i just love her .
she makes me laugh so much .
what ? what @-@ what , are you humming ?
dad , just so we have this conversation ...
no , no , jess .
she seems like the type of girl who might hurt you .
jessica ...
i &apos;ve seen you get hurt by a lot less .
please , don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t go there .
no matter what you say , you &apos;re not gonna change my mind .
i &apos;m in love with her , and i &apos;m gonna marry her .
gonna ... get a new mom , jess .
* she &apos;s so high ... *
hey , are you okay ? because i am not sure if you heard that ,
but there is going to be a wedding .
there will be no wedding .
and it begins .
why are we meeting in a parking garage ?
because what we are doing is unsavory
and we &apos;re hiding from god .
and you also ...
you promised winston and everybody pizza , so ...
yeah , you definitely did .
yes , there &apos;ll be pizza . just do one thing for me first .
here , memorize these .
that &apos;s yours . that &apos;s yours .
&quot; i love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand . &quot;
look , i had to scramble , you guys .
i told my bosses how much men love to clean .
what are talking about ?
only you .
yeah , only ...
yeah . i know !
why do you think i &apos;m rigging this focus group ?
&quot; sponges make me feel more exhilarated
than any home run or touchdown ever could . &quot;
this is ridiculous , man .
i &apos;m out !
i can buy my own pizza .
can somebody please loan me $ 15 ?
and maybe like 20 , 25 , depending on toppings ,
&apos;cause i &apos;d love to get a bunch of ham .
ham .
what about the tip , dude ? what about tip ?
i don &apos;t give tips .
it &apos;s for delivery .
you don &apos;t tip delivery people , ever .
you definitely tip delivery people , but ...
guys . guys .
i get sponges , this solves all our problems . okay ?
i make more money , nick gets his room back ,
i get my life back on track .
punting the sweet fantastic .
for the last time , schmidt ,
that doesn &apos;t mean anything !
fine . but i &apos;m gonna need one hour
in a quiet room to get into character .
no .
right on .
after long and thoughtful and careful consideration ,
winston is in .
okay .
assuming pizza is still on the table .
say &quot; pizza &quot; one more time , winston .
no , just don &apos;t .
just don &apos;t .
no , we just never talked about
when we &apos;re gonna ...
don &apos;t .
just don &apos;t bring it up .
he &apos;s getting really mad .
like , delivery of ...
say &quot; pizza . &quot; say &quot; pizza &quot; one more time .
don &apos;t say it again .
say &quot; pizza &quot; again .
pizza .
say &quot; pizza &quot; one more time ,
i &apos;m gonna k @-@ kill you !
i just thought maybe we &apos;d talk about toppings ,
perhaps , or something .
not a mirror .
not a mirror , you idiot .
not a mirror .
sponges make me feel exhilarated more than any ...
did you just say &quot; sponges make me feel exhilarated &quot; ?
no , no . i @-@ i ..
what do you think of sponges ?
they &apos;re stupid .
that &apos;s how i feel .
i mean , who cares ?
ex ... that &apos;s exactly how i feel .
what do you think of this whole place ?
i &apos;d rather not be here .
&quot; be here &quot; is what i was about to say .
i &apos;m nick .
i &apos;m brittany .
oh , my god , we have so much in common .
okay .
my dad can &apos;t marry her .
he gets hurt in relationships with normal women .
yeah .
he can &apos;t handle a recovering sex addict .
no .
what if she relapses ?
it would crush him . it would crush his heart .
i can &apos;t let this happen . i have to protect him .
so what are you gonna do ?
i could write him a letter about my feelings .
we ... yeah , but her phone is in her purse ,
and we could check her phone for dirt on her .
but he hates letters .
he always gets so frustrated opening the envelope .
you know you want to check her phone .
you know you want to .
cece , we &apos;re adults ;
we &apos;re gonna handle this like adults .
we &apos;re not snooping .
you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
that is ... that &apos;s a huge violation of privacy ;
you can &apos;t do that .
put that ... what does it say ?
it &apos;s bad .
give that to me .
dad , she &apos;s cheating on you !
what ?
yeah , just ask jim .
at 10 : 40 , jim heard she was in town .
at 11 : 52,
jim had his hands down his pants .
at 11 : 53 ...
cumin ?
what , is he cooking cumin ?
oh , my god .
my dad is the best guy in the world ,
and you better hit the damn road , unless you want to say hello to
my old friends crabtree and evelyn .
that &apos;s my work phone . i &apos;m a sex therapist .
jim is my client .
your ... your client ?
client !
client .
client .
client .
am i supposed to say &quot; client &quot; now ?
i &apos;m gonna go . this was clearly a mistake .
no .
and for the record ,
george jiang gave me giardia .
i saved you from a hideous river disease .
thank you .
damn it . she won &apos;t answer any of my calls .
i left ten voice mails .
two of them , i &apos;m screaming . three , i &apos;m crying .
one is a long silent one . nothing !
and it &apos;s all your fault-- both of you guys .
but mostly you .
look , dad , i &apos;m so sorry .
is there anything i can do ...
there &apos;s nothing more that you can do .
i @-@ i knew this was a mistake bringing her here .
wait , dad .
so , why don &apos;t you tell me
what you think about that sponge there , coach .
i mean ... ernie .
i don &apos;t know why i would call you coach .
okay .
well , i love sponges
because they connect my heart to my hand .
thank you so much for that .
i wish my buddies could see me now .
what ?
they &apos;d be all like , &quot; hey , man ,
let me get a hit of that squishy whip . &quot;
right on . way to , uh , add your own take .
to @-@ to your ... to your own take .
you know , i @-@ i have something i &apos;d like to add .
please .
i like cleaning .
you like cleaning .
it is the only thing
i can control in a world filled with chaos .
thank you .
may i add ,
i am thor , and this is my hammer , mjolnir .
m ... melnir . mjolnir .
okay , wonderful detail . thank you so much for that .
how about you down there , mayor of the corner ?
nick .
what ?
how does cleaning make you feel ?
like i @-@ i &apos;m cleaning .
move on to somebody else , please .
read the cards that i gave you . remember the cards ?
not now .
read your cards !
you want to know what i think about your sponges ? !
well , this is clearly rigged .
my office .

schmidt ...
schmidt , i &apos;m sorry .
dad .
thanks for waiting .
i wasn &apos;t waiting .
i just can &apos;t get this damn thing started .
you &apos;re just pressing buttons .
this was supposed to be a big weekend for me and ashley .
i had everything planned .
i @-@ i even wrote new lyrics to our @-@ our song .
ashley , marry me ...
y @-@ you didn &apos;t have to do that , you know .
i can take care of myself .
can you ?
dad , if i hadn &apos;t protected you after you and mom &apos;s divorce ,
you would &apos;ve ended up with nancy zimmerman .
nancy zimmerman .
she was bad news , dad .
v @-@ very bad . you don &apos;t know the half of it .
that woman made me try cocaine in 2005 .
what , dad ? !
booger sugar ?
yes .
nicaraguan yazz .
are you kidding me ?
it was a very expensive evening .
i wound up buying his and her jet skis .
the point is i &apos;m still standing ,
and i can take care of myself .
yes , i might get hurt ,
but that &apos;ll be my problem .
you don &apos;t need to do it anymore , jess .
i should be taking care of you .
ashley is different from any woman i &apos;ve ever dated .
she @-@ she makes every day better .
i @-@ i want to spend the rest of my life with her .
aw , dad , that &apos;s so sweet .
hey , th ... ashley !
what did she do ?
she went out and found a guy ?
she &apos;s gonna relapse .
oh , we have to turn her off .
ashley ...
let &apos;s turn on npr and blare it .
ashley , wait . wait a minute . please .
please don &apos;t do this . please .
ashley , if you &apos;re gonna relapse ,
relapse with my dad .
i &apos;m not relapsing .
this is roy . he &apos;s my l.a. sponsor .
this is roy ? oh !
you know , i @-@ i always wanted to meet you . hi .
jess , he &apos;s not a strange man .
he &apos;s a sex addict .
former sex addict . uh , current chocoholic .
i &apos;d be in trouble if you were black .
thank you ?
ashley , look , i screwed up .
i have to let my dad make mistakes .
oh , i &apos;m a mistake ?
no , you are not a mistake .
that came out wrong .
i &apos;m sorry , bob .
i never meant to come between you and your daughter .
i love you so damn much .
you &apos;re my big , round , bald ,
fuzzy weeble @-@ wobble .
but i just ... i just need a little space .
it &apos;s not over , dad .
get the ring .
i &apos;m sorry , schmidt .
what can i say ?
you &apos;re just not really built to play with the big girls .
don &apos;t fire him !
oh , god .
what the ... why ?
give him the account .
he &apos;s a hard worker , and he &apos;s a neat freak .
how do i know that ? &apos; cause i share a room with him .
you two share a room ?
and you should see his side .
it is so clean .
it looks like the inside of a japanese subway .
speaking of sharing a bedroom ,
brittany &apos;s coming over tonight .
uh , so i &apos;m gonna need ten to 15 minutes of privacy for ...
i don &apos;t need 15 minutes . that &apos;s excessive .
give me five to ten .
that feels braggy .
give me three to five ,
but no less than three &apos; cause that &apos;s rude to girls .
do you really think that she &apos;s gonna have sex with you
in that pulp @-@ covered filth bunker ?
i &apos;ll throw a tarp down .
oh , god .
what if she &apos;s turned off by the mess ?
what if she &apos;s turned off by ...
what if she &apos;s turned off by the mess ?
hey , gina , why don &apos;t you hear me out here for a second .
that &apos;s all right .
if nick cleans his room
before brittany comes over , he might get laid .
i don &apos;t know . it seems like a lot of work .
not with the right tool .
we open up on a modern man
with a nose that only america could love .
this might seem obvious ,
but what side does the dirty stuff go on ?
he doesn &apos;t know a lot ,
but he &apos;s about to discover the ultimate wingman .
i bet this side is
really good for tough areas .
the man sponge .
because the dirtiest thing in your room ...
probably be her .
yay . we &apos;re doing a pitch .
yeah .
i ... can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this ,
but i like it .
all right , you get the sponge account , schmidt .
sponges .
we got sponges .
we got sponges .
we got sponges . we got sponges .
wait !
ashley ! my dad loves you !
no matter what ! wait !
* ashley ... *

jess , baby , baby , are you okay ?
you ... here , come on , come on .
let &apos;s get you to a hospital .
yeah . yes .
oh , my god ! is she okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , are you okay ?
you need to do it now , dad ,
before we get flattened by a parade . come on .
ashley ... will you marry me ?
and be the stepmom to a very crazy
but @-@ but very lovable woman ?
yes .
yes . yes !
oh , yes !
jess , you &apos;re my little girl now .
oh , jess .
you go to your room . i &apos;m just kidding .
i &apos;m kidding . but you should go to a @-@ a hospital .
here &apos;s to attending a wedding
with everyone from high school
and my dad &apos;s side of the family .
it &apos;s gonna be great . it &apos;s like going to prom
with all my dad &apos;s friends .
cheer , cheer !
no , no , no , no . don &apos;t worry , don &apos;t worry .
i got it . i got it . i &apos;ll just clean it .
dude , there &apos;s a sponge
in your hand .
no , let him go .
he &apos;s my inspiration .
you know , living with him
in that slovenly hellhole
has been a secret blessing .
it &apos;s made me stronger .
without ash to rise from ,
the phoenix would just be a bird getting up .
i am a phoenix , and i will rise .
he usually says that speech before sex .
by 2015 , i will have my own room .
and by 2016 ...
what is he looking at ?
i don &apos;t know .
... i will be a millionaire .
sponging make wipe .
the man sponge .
because the dirstiest thing in the room ...
should be me .
sponge .
sponge .
