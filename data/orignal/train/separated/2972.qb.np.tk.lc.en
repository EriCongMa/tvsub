previously on friends :
how did the job stuff go ?
he offered me one !
you know what ? this calls for a bottle of lsrael &apos;s finest !
the job is in paris .
oh , god , please , somebody say something .
so if you take this job , you &apos;ll be moving to paris ?
or facing a bitch of a commute .
i know , it &apos;s huge , and it &apos;s scary and it &apos;s really far away from you guys .
but this is such an incredible opportunity for me .
i &apos;ve already told them about our situation with emma ..
and they said they &apos;ll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable .
i mean , i &apos;ll fly back and forth , they &apos;ll fly you out . anything we want .
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle .
all right . we &apos;ll work it out .
oh , thank you . thank you .
you sure this is what you want ?
i think it is .
what &apos;s going on ?
i got a really incredible job offer .
hey , great ! all right !
good for you !
it &apos;s in paris .
what ?
no , no , no ! no , no , no ! no , too much is changing , okay ?
first phoebe getting married . congratulations .
and then these two move in to a stupid house in the stupid suburbs .
earlier , you said you &apos;d be supportive .
it comes and goes . i wouldn &apos;t trust it !
you guys , this is really , really important to me .
it means a lot if you could try to get onboard .
of course we can . congratulations .
thank you .
joey ?
no , my hugs are reserved for people staying in america !
joey , it would mean ..
no ! get your france @-@ going arms away from me !
are you okay with this ?
well , it makes me feel sad , but ..
talking to ross .
i see .
rachel moving to another country ? not being able to see her every day ?
how could i be okay with this ?
but what are we gonna do ? she really needs this job .
do you think if ralph lauren offered her her old job back , she would take it ?
how &apos;s that gonna happen ?
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ?
like , i don &apos;t know , i could talk to her boss . yeah .
i met him at that christmas party . i mean , we really hit it off .
the guy who kept calling you &quot; ron &quot; ?
i didn &apos;t say we were brothers !
technically , this is not a hug .
the.one.where.estelle.dies
you read the obituaries ?
yeah . well , i got a few curses on people .
i just like to see how they &apos;re coming .
hey , phoebe . hey .
hi .
the house next door to the one that we &apos;re buying just went on the market .
i wanna take a look at it , but chandler doesn &apos;t .
we close escrow tomorrow .
seeing another house can only confuse us . we &apos;re easily confused .
we &apos;re not very bright .
but what if it &apos;s better than ours ? shouldn &apos;t we look ?
what do you think , phoebe ?
well , i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin @-@ robbins .
anyway ..
hey , isn &apos;t joey &apos;s agent estelle leonard ?
yeah .
she died .
you &apos;re kidding !
that &apos;s terrible .
yeah , last saturday .
wow ! she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic !
wait a minute , i read the wrong one .
oh , yeah ?
yeah , she was just an agent .
joey &apos;s gonna be so upset .
i know . he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic .
we cannot tell joey about this .
he &apos;s already flipping out about everything changing .
this &apos;ll push him over the edge .
you don &apos;t think we should tell him ?
not for a while .
let &apos;s just give him a few days to get used to everything else .
what if he reads the paper ?
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown , i think we &apos;re okay .
may i help you ?
yeah . i &apos;m a friend of rachel green &apos;s .
actually , we met at the christmas party about two years ago .
oh , right . don ?
close . ron .
well , what can i do for you ?
well , i &apos;m here to see if you &apos;ll give rachel her job back .
did she ask you to come here and do this ?
first i have to get you to agree ..
then we &apos;ll see if she wants to come back .
wow , that is tempting .
she loved her job here . let &apos;s face it , you &apos;re not gonna find anyone ..
who did it as well as she did . isn &apos;t that true ?
she is good .
i took a shot there .
but i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s nothing i can do .
oh , that &apos;s not true . there &apos;s nothing i want to do .
i see .
thanks very much .
is this your son ?
yeah , his name is ross .
what ?
nothing , it &apos;s just that it &apos;s close to ron .
does little ross like dinosaurs , by any chance ?
yeah , they &apos;re all he talks about . why ?
how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history ..
after everyone else has left , just the two of us ..
and he can touch anything he wants ?
i just heard it how you must have heard it , and that &apos;s not good .
let me start again . i &apos;m a paleontologist .
you &apos;ll be there with us , and the touching refers only to bones .. fossils !
you could really arrange that ?
you let rachel come back and it &apos;s done .
i guess having rachel back wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing in the world .
yes ! thank you ! this is great ! thank you so much .
i swear , your kid &apos;s gonna have the time of his life .
that &apos;s great . i worry about little ross .
he &apos;s always reading , collecting rocks and he &apos;s obsessed with dinosaurs .
he &apos;ll be fine !
hey , phoebe .
hey .
everything okay ?
i &apos;m just mad at my agent .
estelle ? why ?
there &apos;s a part in this tv movie that i would be perfect for ..
and i didn &apos;t even get put up for it . she better have a good reason .
i &apos;m guessing she does .
well , i wanna hear it , because she keeps doing this .
no , wait , wait , wait ! all right , i gotta go .
just listen . promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her .
well , okay . why ?
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason .
i love that saying !
hello ?
joey , it &apos;s estelle .
i was just gonna call you . that &apos;s weird .
it &apos;s a little coincidental , but believable .
listen , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re wondering why i didn &apos;t get you ..
an audition for that tv movie .
yeah , actually i am .
i guess i dropped the ball there .
that &apos;s it ? you know , it seems like all you do lately is drop the ball .
don &apos;t take that tone with me . who do you think you are ?
alan lemon , the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic ?
no , look , all i &apos;m saying is you &apos;re my agent ..
and you &apos;re not getting me any auditions and i &apos;m tired of it .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that this isn &apos;t working for me anymore , okay , estelle ?
you &apos;re fired . goodbye .
man , tough week for estelle .
hi .
hi .
emma left her stuffed t. rex at my house .
you know she can &apos;t sleep without it .
well , she &apos;s asleep now .
stop forcing that thing on her .
okay .
you &apos;re not gonna believe what happened to me today !
ralph lauren called and gave me my job back !
no !
i mean , it was the weirdest thing .
they fire me and then out of nowhere , they just hire me back .
i mean , that place must just be falling apart without me !
so you &apos;re not going to paris ?
no , i &apos;m still going !
what ?
well , when the louis vuitton people found out ..
that ralph lauren wanted me back , they offered me more money !
ross , isn &apos;t that great ?
hi . we &apos;re buying the house next door . could we just take a look around ?
sure , i &apos;m showing it to someone else right now , but please , look around .
i feel like we &apos;re cheating on our house .
if we cheat , shouldn &apos;t it be with a hot , younger house ..
that does stuff that our house won &apos;t do ?
ours is so much better !
this living room is smaller , the dining room looks like a cave .
what a hole !
so , what do you think ?
love it !
we already have one offer . i think the lady upstairs will make another one .
they could be our neighbors . what are they like ?
the woman upstairs is nice . she and her husband have two kids .
he &apos;s on wall street , and she &apos;s a ..
oh .. my .. god !
sure .
hey , joey , you wanna come with me to .. ?
are you okay ?
yeah , i just feel bad about firing estelle .
this has gotta be killing her .
no , that wouldn &apos;t kill her .
a coronary embolism might .
i don &apos;t know . she &apos;s gotta be taking it hard . i was her only client .
except for this guy who eats paper .
and i &apos;m guessing he eats more money than he makes .
look , i know she &apos;s not a great agent , but she did stick with me for 10 years .
i &apos;m gonna call her and hire her again .
no , no , no ! don &apos;t call her .
you wait for her to call you .
why ?
because patience is the road to understanding .
which is the key to a happy heart .
you blow me away .
all right , so promise you &apos;re gonna wait for her to call you ?
i promise .
okay .
and that means never having to give a reason .
what a small world !
and yet i never run into beyonce .
you two know each other ?
we go way back . before monica made an honest man out of him ..
chandler used to be my little love muffin .
don &apos;t judge me .
why not ? i do .
so are you guys thinking of getting this house too ?
are we gonna have a bidding war ? i better warn you , i &apos;m a toughie .
don &apos;t .. don &apos;t .. don &apos;t ..
don &apos;t do that .
no , actually , we are buying the house next door .
why ?
i don &apos;t know why .
oh , that decides it , then ! i was on the fence .
but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ?
now we have to get it !
ellen , we &apos;re gonna talk numbers .
this cannot be happening .
the realtor said another couple made an offer .
maybe the janices won &apos;t get it ! maybe the other couple will .
the only way that &apos;ll happen is if the other couple are the hitlers !
okay , okay ! all right , what if we get both houses ?
we can turn this one into a guesthouse !
that &apos;s a great idea !
by the way , i don &apos;t mean to sound distasteful ..
but when did you start crapping money ?
you come up with an idea .
all right .
we &apos;ve still got three hours till escrow closes on our house .
we can still get out .
but we love our house .
will we love it so much with her next door ?
and she &apos;s gonna be louder out here too !
just the crickets and , &quot; oh .. my .. god ! &quot;
okay . but if we don &apos;t get this house , she &apos;ll still show up wherever we go .
at least if she &apos;s here , it eliminates the element of surprise .
never again will you have to hear the three words ..
that make your balls jump back up inside your body !
well , we have to do something . we can &apos;t have her living next door .
oh , that does it too .
who is it ?
it &apos;s me . ron .
look , i know rachel turned you down ..
but i think there &apos;s a way you might be able to get her to come back .
this may surprise you , but rehiring fired employees is not my main job .
just hear me out .
how would you feel about offering her a raise ?
not good , ron .
perhaps i can persuade you .
what if you could give your son ..
this genuine pterodactyl egg replica .
wow ! that &apos;s pretty cool .
so ? do we have a deal ?
okay , you got it .
yes ! yes !
this is gonna make me very popular .
believe me , the ladies , they love it .
i meant with my son .
good , because the ladies , not so much .
joey , this is al zebooker , the guy who eats paper .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard that estelle passed away .
i wanted to let you know there &apos; s a memorial for her ..
at the westside chapel tomorrow at 10 .
hope you can make it .
oh , my god .
hello ?
joey , it &apos; s estelle .
estelle ?
yeah , i wanted to call and tell you that there &apos;s no hard feelings for firing me .
okay . i just .. i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re calling me .
i didn &apos;t think i should just drop by .
no , no ! don &apos;t drop by ! don &apos;t drop by !
anyway , you did what you had to do . i &apos;m okay .
can i ask you something ?
what &apos;s it like there ?
it &apos;s all right .
look , kiddo , i gotta go .
good luck with the career . you &apos;re gonna be huge !
thanks for everything , estelle . bye .
&quot; out of area . &quot; boy , i &apos;ll say !
well , i just talked to sid .
we are definitely putting in an offer on the house .
and i &apos;ll bet we get it !
the hitlers will be so disappointed .
all right , i gotta run . tell monica i say goodbye .
i &apos;ll see you later , neighbor .
wait !
i just want you to know that i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re going to be here .
oh , me too !
because ..
that way ..
we can pick up where we left off .
i never stopped loving you .
oh .. my ..
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
i want you .
i need you .
i must have you , janice litman @-@ goralnik nee hosenstein .
chandler , what are you talking about ?
now that you live next door , we can be together every day .
sid and monica never have to know a thing .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
i mean , you know , obviously we have this heat between us .
obviously .
but i love my husband .
and i know you love your wife .
i don &apos;t think we should get this house now .
don &apos;t say that . don &apos;t dangle the dream and take it away .
chandler , one of us has got to be strong .
i understand .
although ..
maybe just one last moment of weakness .
goodbye , chandler bing .
they &apos;re never coming down now !
hi .
hi !
you are never going to believe what happened to me today .
what ?
ralph lauren called , again , and they offered me more money .
they did ?
yes !
it was the weirdest thing.zelner called me and said , &quot; we will do anything we can to get you back . &quot;
and that i should thank some &quot; ron . &quot;
i don &apos;t even know what department that guy &apos;s in !
so , what are you gonna do ?
well , i took it !
that &apos;s great ! so you &apos;re staying in new york !
you &apos;re excited , right ?
you know .. look , the money &apos;s great .
it &apos;s certainly the easier choice .
right .
but , you know , i mean , was i looking forward to going to paris ? sure .
was i excited about working in the fashion capital of the world ?
oh , absolutely .
yeah , but you know , this is ..
it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m fine going back to a job where i &apos;ve pretty much ..
gotten everything out of it that i possibly can .
i had no idea ..
i had no idea you were so excited about paris .
i mean , you said you were scared .
i mean , it was &quot; good &quot; scared , though , you know ?
i mean , like &quot; when i moved to new york &quot; scared .
or &quot; when i found out i was gonna have emma &quot; scared .
but this is fine . this is gonna be good .
you should go .
what ?
it &apos;s what you want . you should go .
you really think so ?
i really do .
but i already told zelner that i would come back .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll understand .
all right . all right ! i &apos;m gonna do it ! i &apos;m gonna go to paris !
yeah .
yeah .
i &apos;m going to paris !
thank you , ross .
yeah , yeah .
oh , i &apos;m so happy .
then i &apos;m happy too .
thank you all for coming .
we &apos;re here today to pay our respects to a wonderful agent ..
and a beautiful woman .
inside .
as estelle &apos;s only two clients , we would like to say a few words .
dude , where &apos;s my speech ?
