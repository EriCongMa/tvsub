his name is archie decoste ,
age 22 , total years spent in high school : seven .
sat score : zero .
and he was recently arrested for selling marijuana
to a police officer at a police station .
so , you want us to help you recruit this idiot
instead of an honors student or a science genius ?
do we go to the same greendale ?
ah , but let me reveal the fortune inside this cookie .
family net worth : $ 8 million .
ladies and gentlemen , this is what we
in the community college recruiting game call a &quot; whale . &quot;
the perfect mix of low intellect ,
high lack of ambition , and limitless parental support .
so , a rich dumb @-@ dumb who will never graduate
and keep dropping money into the school indefinitely .
got it .
is there really that much money in this , dean ,
or is it like that endorsement deal
you made with let &apos;s potato chips ?
if you don &apos;t like the crispy @-@ licious taste of let &apos;s ,
feel free to eat that other greasy brand .
splingles ? not this guy .
thank you , troy ,
and , i will explain the value of this whale
by describing one who &apos;s been swimming right under your nose .
pierce hawthorne has taken 80 %
of greendale &apos;s classes more than twice .
he is the only greendale student who has ever paid for
a premium locker or the extended pencil warranty .
pierce cannot know about this .
he &apos;s a big baby who throws tantrums
when anyone else gets attention .
remember when kerri strug visited our campus ?
that was horrible .
that was awful .
i have scheduled archie &apos;s visit for tomorrow
when pierce has no classes .
guys , i &apos;m asking ,
as treasurer of the forensics club .
the dean said we could use some of the whale money
for a new body farm .
who wants to help ?
i &apos;m in . sounds like a romper .
we do need money .
the biology department &apos;s been dissecting
the same dead pig for ten years .
if we land this kid ,
we can buy 100 dead pigs
and make everybody happy .
i &apos;ll help where i can ,
but i started a new pe class .
i &apos;ve been avoiding it for three years ,
but you can &apos;t run from running forever .
i &apos;m in pe too .
i made room in my trophy case .
then , i remembered classes don &apos;t give out trophies ,
so i put a fishbowl there instead .
it &apos;s been quite the week .
so , the rest of us will have to pick up the slack ,
and , yes , jeffrey , i assume you &apos;re out ,
because of your track record of literally
being too cool for school .
actually , you can count me in on this one .
what ?
you had me at &quot; no pierce . &quot;
he &apos;s been all over me lately to hang out .
it &apos;s weird .
you just want to be a part of something .
admit it , thanksgiving softened that winger underbelly .
ugh , britta .
now , let &apos;s set sail and hunt that whale !
yeah .
hey , let &apos;s do that .
you know what the commercial says .
&quot; keep your damn hands off my let &apos;s . &quot;
第四季 第七集
hey , jeff .
i was thinking we could swing by this great barbershop i know .
you &apos;re looking a little stubbly ,
and nobody handles a razor like an italian .
they develop nimble fingers from pleasing their mistresses .
thank you for opening my eyes to two new stereotypes .
now , how can i put this ?
no . i don &apos;t want to go .
not now , not ever . no .
no prob .
we &apos;ll work around your skedge .
it &apos;s okay . pierce is gone .
yes .
walking dead has left the building .
resume &quot; operation : deadliest catch . &quot;
archie is gonna love this banner .
the name @-@ brand glitter really shows .
school board guys in the hizzie !
richie , richie , pace yourself .
hey , there , dean .
just thought we &apos;d pop in
and check on the big whale hunt .
ah , what a day we have planned for young archie .
library tour , calculator lab demonstration ...
and , it all culminates
in the &quot; spirit of greendale &quot; reception .
magnitude is a soft yes .
oh , wow , that &apos;s a get .
as much as we love that magnitude ,
your tour may be lacking a little ...
tour sucks , bro .
what ?
you gotta think big .
hookers , blow , hookers .
he &apos;s been mixing ,
but there is some wisdom there .
we need this whale money .
the kid likes snowboarding .
maybe shaun white finds his way on the faculty roster .
he likes to party .
maybe greendale suddenly has a frat .
the delta cubes , or whatever .
dean , you &apos;re not considering this , are you ?
no , no . greendale stands on its own .
no hookers , no blow ,
no shaun white frat .
college dean threatening a fraternity .
you &apos;ll never shut down the delta cubes .
you &apos;ll never shut down the delta cubes .
what ?
delta cubes , delta cubes , delta cubes ...
look , it &apos;s your call , craig .
don &apos;t let this whale swim away .
cruise by skeeper &apos;s express for a refill ?
i &apos;ll second that motion .
i &apos;ve been working on my victory dances .
basketball , football ,
and crab soccer .
that one &apos;s the hard one .
well , that &apos;s nice .
hey , when i was in grade school ,
pe was about being picked on and picked last ,
but , you &apos;ll put me on your team , right ?
right ... but also , wrong .
pe &apos;s about survival of the fittest .
line up , class .
welcome to pee . i &apos;m coach jason chapman .
physical education education ?
i thought that was a typo in the course &quot; cartalogue . &quot;
it started as a typo ,
but it &apos;s grown into one of greendale &apos;s
most successful programs .
anyone can take pe .
i teach my student coaches to teach pe .
something funny , coach barnes ?
no , it &apos;s just ...
you &apos;re teaching us how to be gym teachers .
gym teachers ?
a gym is a building ,
a man @-@ made structure inside which
physical education teachers
teach physical education to physical education students .
pop quiz , coach barnes ,
a student is choking on a plastic golf ball .
what do you do ?
i ...
how many orange cones does it take to
line a regulation soccer field ?
what if students are talking during stretches ?
when my kids talk past bedtime ,
i use my angry voice , and i say ,
&quot; the next peep i hear will be the last , &quot;
and i give &apos; em one of these .
not bad , coach bennett .
look at me !
i see you .
two hours late ?
this is exactly the lack of follow @-@ through
that makes archie so appealing ,
but still , send a text , right ?
okay , abed , i told you we &apos;re not doing
the fraternity idea .
the delta cubes will never die .
we &apos;ve only just begun to fight .
you only began yesterday .
whale , ho ! look alive , everyone .
hey , what are you guys all doing out here ?
oh , no ! pierce will ruin everything !
what &apos;s an archie ? why does he get a banner ?
jeff ! do something .
there you are , pierce .
thought you were gonna cancel our plans .
plans ?
to spend the entire day
together away from everyone else .
oh , yeah ! those plans .
suck it , bozos .
you &apos;re getting ditched by the cool kids .
oh , what a day we &apos;re gonna have .
text me the instant i can ditch him .
hey , guys .
sweet campus .
welcome to greendale . i &apos;m bean pelton .
&quot; bean pelton &quot; ? dean pelton .
gosh , i &apos;m nervous .
please enroll in our school . please , please .
nice scooter , archie .
yeah , city college gave it to me as a present .
city college ?
city college bought you a vespa ?
brand @-@ new .
so , archie , have you heard about
our half @-@ pipes and hash pipes class ,
taught by professor shaun white ?
what ?
yeah , let me tell you about it
in our mountain dew cool zone tent .
put up a tent , write &quot; mountain dew &quot; on it ,
make it cool .
ah , here we go .
let &apos;s keep going . this is our library .
okay archie , why don &apos;t you &quot; hang ten &quot; on the web
while i talk business , and you know what ?
you can take that computer .
sweet !
my friends and i can drop it off an overpass .
ah , i shouldn &apos;t have heard that .
dean , you &apos;re giving him our computers ?
he is a 22 @-@ year @-@ old stoner @-@ head
whose parents bought him a ged .
which college is he going to choose ?
vespa state , or &quot; ooh , look at our library &quot; university ?
those school board guys were right .
britta , where do we get drugs ?
really ?
look who stumbled onto the high road .
this is a slippery slope .
well , city college slipped that slope
when they slipped him that scooter ,
but they sure slipped up when they let him set foot on our soil .
three , two , one !
time !
coach barnes , it seems dodge ball storage
isn &apos;t quite in your skill set ,
much like table tennis prep .
excellent job , coach bennett .
you have the spatial reasoning skills
of a young kevin miller ,
a really good pe teacher i know .
the skill of ranking others in order
of ability is crucial .
in this next drill , our two best student coaches
will split the rest of the class :
coach bennett , coach neil .
yeah !
pick your teams .
coach donovan .
coach goldman .
coach mckenna .
coach cutler .
coach winston .
ooh , coach dornetto .
coach guest .
coach panos !
choose wisely .
you &apos;re one decision away from victory or defeat .
coach ... marzec .
well picked , coach bennett .
your team wins !
oh , we won ! nice !
ah , the barbershop .
a reminder of a bygone era when men were men ,
and women were sex cooks who did laundry .
i &apos;ve been getting a daily shave here for decades .
and apparently , reading the same eight magazines the entire time .
yeah , national geographic &apos;s got some tribal boob shots
that are exquisite .
there &apos;s something about a breast
that &apos;s never been touched by white hands .
you are a complicated man .
silvio , spin up lucky number seven .
you know what ?
that feels good , i &apos;ll give you that .
now , that soda goblet
gets you free refills in the cafeteria ,
and it was painted by our professor ed hardy ...
who teaches bikini class .
oh , yeah !
whoa , check out that bling !
i want that .
you heard him , annie ! bling the king !
yeah , just take it off of him .
there you go .
thank you .
delta cubes !
prepare to bond through embarrassment .
pacifiers in !
commence ...
code dean ! code dean !
gosh dean it , abed ! i told you , no fraternities !
there &apos;s soda all over my kicks !
britta , give archie your scarf so he can dry his kicks .
dry his kicks , britta . put your back into it !
no ! line drawn !
if i wanted to wait on a rich man hand and foot ,
i would &apos;ve gone to dubai with that sheik i met at trader joe &apos;s .
don &apos;t worry about her , archie .
onward to the microbrew pizzatorium !
i think all a man needs in life
is a close shave , a cold beer ,
and you know , maybe a faithful dog .
hm , i had a chocolate lab growing up ... rosie .
she use to wake me up every morning by licking my feet .
mine was walter , a german shepherd .
followed me to school every day .
i &apos;d look out the window , and there he was ,
dropping a steaming fat one on the lawn .
would someone please tell me
why i &apos;ve been shaving my own face
all these years like a sucker ?
this state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mock locker room ,
or &quot; mocker room , &quot;
simulates the conditions of an actual locker room .
don &apos;t we have an actual locker room ?
you think you &apos;re ready for that , coach barnes ?
for our next drill , drama students
will play the role of pe students ,
and each of you will oversee them in a &quot; mocker room &quot; setting .
my character just had her first period .
mine has eczema !
coach bennett , care to go first ?
yes !
keep your hands to yourself !
running will get you five laps , mister !
joey !
i will come in that shower and kick yo bare ass !
sorry , coach bennett .
i have never seen such natural disciplinary skills .
you &apos;re up next , coach barnes .
entertain us with your ineptitude .
how &apos;s the foam machine coming , leonard ?
memories will be made tonight .
destiny !
oh , thank you for coming on such short notice .
well , i did get your christmas card .
look ... no , so ... no , no , no time to pre @-@ party .
you and the girls get in position and wait for my signal .
strippers ?
oh , tons .
it &apos;s good for the school .
the whale is here . balloon drop , go !
there you go .
release the whores .
oh , yeah .
no way !
pierce .
i was wrong about this shop .
it really is special .
well , if you like the place so much ,
why don &apos;t you gay marry it ?
you probably didn &apos;t notice it , jeff ,
but i &apos;ve been subtly trying to get us some alone time .
i might &apos;ve picked up on that .
i &apos;m no stranger to father issues ,
so i know confronting your dad couldn &apos;t have been easy ,
and i just want to say i &apos;m proud of you .
well ... if you &apos;re so proud ...
why don &apos;t you gay marry me ?
you guys , behave !
hit the showers ! everybody in the showers !
please stop hitting each other !
hit the showers !
cut ! scene !
shirley , help .
i can &apos;t control these drama students or their characters .
no ! no !
pe is survival of the fittest , troy .
hey , your phone &apos;s buzzing .
ooh , it &apos;s from annie . you sly dog .
&quot; need more time . keep pierce busy . &quot;
keep me busy ?
look , the group is giving some big shot a tour ,
so it &apos;s my job to keep you busy .
you know how you get jealous .
so , that &apos;s why you spent the day with me ?
you drew the short straw .
well , that &apos;s how it started ,
but i really did end up having a good time .
yeah , i used to regret not having a son to bring here .
i &apos;m glad i didn &apos;t have kids .
they just end up disappointing you .
so archie , having a good time ?
gettin &apos; cray up in this club ?
sicker than ever , bro !
i &apos;ve made my decision , dean .
i &apos;m about to get all up in this greendale .
human beings , it &apos;s official !
say hello to our newest greendalian ,
archie decoste !
pop pop !
pop pop !
i want that to be my thing now .
i don &apos;t think you can do that .
magnitude , you &apos;re not to say &quot; pop pop &quot; ever again .
not pop ?
that &apos;s right . find a new thing .
get him out of here .
ah ! here we go ! we &apos;re back !
pop pop !
well , we did it .
we did what we had to do ,
and i feel great about it .
it &apos;s all for greendale .
all for greendale .
oh , you look pretty sad for someone whose forensics club
can now afford that state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art body farm .
i can smell the corpses now .
none of this is weighing on you ?
sha !
the only thing weighing on me is tons and tons of whale money .
ah , jeffrey .
hey . landed a whale , huh ?
yeah , but i &apos;m starting to feel like maybe we ...
archie goes to greendale now .
we &apos;re moving forward , annie !
okay , we all paid a price .
you don &apos;t hear jeffrey grumbling ,
and , he had to spend a whole day with walking dead .
well , that &apos;s true .
you know what ?
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna say this .
don &apos;t talk about pierce like that .
look , maybe the only reason he can be so unpleasant
is because we expect him to be .
if we don &apos;t treat him like such a dick ...
well , he &apos;ll probably still be one 98 % of the time ,
but the 2 % he &apos;s tolerable ,
it might be worth it .
who put the salt in his cereal , huh ?
look , i , for one , am still proud of what we did for greendale .
i &apos;ve been up all night trying out new catchphrases .
diggity doo ?
my god , what have we done ?
i thought you dropped pee .
i did , but i lost my keys in the mocker .
i had to hitchhike home last night in a burrito truck .
it &apos;s not as fun as it sounds .
i &apos;m sorry for how i acted in class .
don &apos;t apologize .
you were the fittest , and you survived .
still , no one deserves to be mocked
for being mock @-@ locked in a mock locker .
friends should help friends survive .
ah ! oh , geez !
so , i &apos;m going to help you learn
to teach the most unteachable student there is .
* teachers teaching to teach *
* coaches coaching to coach *
* you &apos;ve gotta dig down deep *
* to prove you want it the most *
* get your physical education *
* there &apos;s no room in the gym for hesitation *
* pee is not pe *
* it &apos;s a totally different philosophy *
* it &apos;s physical education *
* education *
well done , coach barnes .
you as well , coach bennett .
you know , i was supposed to teach you two
to teach other people , but instead ,
you ended up teaching me .
i did it !
i used the water fountain .
archie , wake up !
chillax , bro .
it &apos;s not even noon .
i will neither chill nor relax .
all this hoopla is not what greendale really is .
greendale is a nice welcome banner .
greendale is a foamless cafeteria .
and greendale is magnitude saying &quot; pop pop . &quot;
now , i am a man of very little integrity ,
and i let students get away with practically
anything on this campus ,
but i will not allow greendale
to lose the things that make it greendale .
now , archie , i would love for you to enroll in my school ,
but i will not change it for you .
greendale will stay greendale ,
no matter what .
you know what ?
everybody kisses my ass because my dad is loaded ,
and they always give me free stuff ,
like that jet ski i sunk ,
but it would be pretty sweet
to be treated like a normal dude ...
so i &apos;m in .
magnitude .
you usually have the perfect blend
of brevity and wit that sums up situations like this .
pop pop !
oh , that &apos;s so good !
so good !
i think we all learned today that
all human beings deserve dignity .
delta cubes ! delta cubes !
delta cubes ! delta cubes !
delta cubes ! delta cubes !
delta cubes , operation : slack attack !
slack attack ?
delta cubes ! delta cubes !
mark my words , delta cubes ,
you &apos;ll pay for this !
is this seat taken ?
free country .
you know , i was thinking
i might start coming here more often .
i like the vibe .
you know what sport i never got ?
golf .
no argument here .
they lost me immediately with the clown clothes .
you know , i belong to a dozen country clubs .
never played .
i just spend my time hitting on the waitresses .
there &apos;s something about a country club waitress
that just makes you wanna pay your dues every year .
* let &apos;s snack it up *
* let &apos;s do it right *
* let &apos;s taste the crisp with the flavor and crunch *
* with all our might *
* let &apos;s grab a bag *
* let &apos;s take a bite *
* let &apos;s grab potato chips , let &apos;s do it right *
get your damn hand off of my let &apos;s !
honestly , after all that , you still eat splingles ?
uh , yeah , troy .
splingles have 30 % less fat .
they &apos;re the fit chip .
you know , i kinda have a headache .
