no free refills . got it ?

everything okay ?
oh , you haven &apos;t touched your bacon .
that &apos;s bacon ?
who knew ?
well , it &apos;s turkey bacon . it &apos;s got a lot less fat in it .
try it . it &apos;s good .
you got any ketchup ?
hey ! do you see the sign ? no outside drinks !
easy , stanley .
sorry .
he made me throw mine away , too .
would you like a cappuccino on the house ?
no , thanks . i had enough coffee .
rizzoli !
where &apos;s the big tub of cream cheese ?
it had mold on it .
so scrape it off ! you think i &apos;m made of money ?
sir , are you all right ?
mr. stanley , call for help !
all you had to do was open the cafe .
what did you do to him ?
nothing ! call 911 !
sergeant ! get in here and help !
what going on ?
he just fell over . i don &apos;t know what to do .
get the cpr mask .
we need an ambulance at 3 schroeder plaza .
oh . so you come faster if it &apos;s a cop ?
keep people out of the cafe .
no , it &apos;s a fat guy .
oh , god .
he is dead .
drink .
thank you .
instant ?
you served me instant ?
i &apos;m so tired , you &apos;re lucky i didn &apos;t serve you drano .
ugh ! god .
where &apos;s the baby ?
tommy took the last shift .
why would people have more than one of these ?
how &apos;d you get him to stop crying ?
i did this for two hours . my arms are wrecked .
he &apos;d be better if he was breast @-@ fed .
don &apos;t look at me .
newborns need a lot of human contact to properly attach .
take him out of the car seat .
no , he was almost falling asleep .
okay .
come here .
hello . how good .
his name &apos;s mario .
no , you can &apos;t name him mario !
why not ? it &apos;s latin . it means &quot; manly . &quot;
yeah . so there .
hey , maura , you ready to swab me ?
what -- do you two want some privacy ?
i &apos;m gonna find out if he &apos;s my kid today .
let &apos;s do this .
wait -- is this gonna hurt ?
oh , my god . tommy , it &apos;s a giant cotton swab .
open .
okay .
okay , now it &apos;s mario &apos;s turn .
you &apos;re not a mario .
he looks just like you , tommy .
we should name him t.j. , for &quot; tommy jr . &quot;
it &apos;s weird that she &apos;s so good with babies .
yeah . it is a little surprising .
wasn &apos;t it wonderful
the way we tag @-@ teamed the feedings all night ?
you know , baby elephants are raised
by the female relatives in the herd --
the aunts , the sisters , grandmothers .
don &apos;t repeat this &apos; cause i &apos;ll deny it ,
but i wish we were elephants
so we could keep him .
maybe me and lydia could share him .
no , lydia abandoned him .
well , technically , she didn &apos;t abandon him .
she left him with family .
which is why i can &apos;t arrest her .
maybe she was just scared .
wow ! one hand ! can i try ?
no !
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
&quot; suspicious death at the division 1 cafe &quot; ?
i hope ma &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s going straight to voicemail .
maura , come on . we &apos;ve got to go .
but i &apos;m in my robe , and you &apos;re in your mother &apos;s pajamas .
yeah , so , we &apos;ll change in the car . come on .
wait -- w @-@ what do i do with him ?
use two hands .
w-- i -- alone ?
jane .
wait . i can &apos;t . jane ?
two hands .
jane !
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
he was enjoying his breakfast special ,
and , boom -- he just drops dead .
how &apos;s the baby ?
he &apos;s fine .
you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve never seen this person before ?
no , never .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s something he ate here
that got him sick , do you ?
botulinum causes death in 2 to 10 hours .
hey , you heard her -- we never saw him before .
he brought whatever killed him with him .
how &apos;d he die ?
i &apos;m not sure .
the hemoptysis suggests all kinds of causes .
we don &apos;t even serve hemoptysis .
hemoptysis simply means he coughed up blood .
his credit cards , cash , photo of this boy .
hey , korsak , look at this .
what the hell ?
victim had my name and phone number in his wallet .
do you recognize him ?
no .
phil taylor , 45 .
worked at jericho pharmaceutical supplies .
i &apos;d like to test the food he was eating .
okay . hey , ma , where &apos;s his plate ?
i , uh ... i don &apos;t know .
stanley , where &apos;s the dead guy &apos;s last meal ?
why are you asking me ? do i look like a busboy ?
jane , he ordered the breakfast special .
a @-@ and he didn &apos;t eat the turkey bacon .
oh , but wait .
he asked for ketchup .
thank you , ma . that &apos;s very helpful .
mr. stanley ? are you okay ?
check on him . make sure he isn &apos;t faking .
i &apos;ll call the paramedics back .
are you feeling any discomfort or tightness in your chest ?
maybe some .
okay , ma , this is serious .
it &apos;s a suspicious death .
the food that you gave the dead guy is evidence .
you think stanley could have gotten rid of it ?
oh , he wouldn &apos;t do that , jane .
i hope not , &apos; cause if he did , he &apos;s going to jail .
oh . oh , thank god , bro . thanks for coming .
i got to get back to work . is the baby okay ?
yeah . i @-@ i think so .
ythink so ?
i fell asleep on the couch .
h @-@ he was sleeping on my chest , and ...
frankie , he rolled off .
oh , my god . did he hit his head ?
no , he landed on a pillow .
oh , tommy .
i know ! what if he can never ride a bike now ?
god , i can &apos;t be a dad !
what ?
and now he hates me !
oh , crap .
what if the neighbors called social services ?
calm down , would you ?
lydia ?
hey , tommy .
oh ! i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , tommy jr .
oh , i love you so much .
&quot; tommy jr . &quot; ?
i wanted to call him mario .
can you forgive me ? can you forgive mommy ?
looks like he does .
you think ?
lydia , you abandoned that baby .
according to my probation officer ,
all she did was leave him with his father .
you the father ?
no .
how about you ?
i might be .
okay . now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
can &apos;t just leave a baby on a doorstep
and then waltz back in when you feel like it .
did he get frostbite ?
what ? ! no , but he --
paperboy hit him with a paper ?
raccoons chew his little arms off ?
no .
okay , then . there you go . he wasn &apos;t abused .
let &apos;s go , lydia .
wait -- wait a minute ! frankie , do something !
will you arrest her ? !
not lydia , though .
i can &apos;t . there &apos;s no legal grounds .
we can &apos;t prove abuse .
technically , all she did is leave him with family .
so , move -- unless you &apos;re gonna shoot us .
i &apos;m sorry .
i thought he might be better off with the rizzolis .
but i ... i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t . he &apos;s my baby .
well , he might be my baby , too .
you know , i @-@ i was up all night with him , taking care of him .
hey , leave her alone . she &apos;s been up bawling all night .
now , come on , lydia .
and don &apos;t think you &apos;re getting out of child support .
i &apos;m sorry for all the trouble .
we &apos;re just gonna go .
cuckoo birds are brood parasites .
you desperately need some sleep .
i &apos;m thinking of creative child @-@ rearing solutions .
okay , what do cuckoo birds do ?
they lay their eggs in a host bird &apos;s nest ,
and then they let that bird raise the babies .
however , they first destroy the host bird &apos;s eggs .
so , all we &apos;ll need to do
is sneak into some nice family &apos;s home ,
drop off t.j. , and get rid of the other kids .
maybe elephants are a better example .
ooh . very nice .
barely digested stomach contents .
mm @-@ hmm . what is it -- eggs ?
good for you ! yes !
can you tell what that is ?
only if there &apos;s a prize .
pancake .
excellent .
i wonder what this is .
smell it .
i &apos;m good .
it &apos;s a mint leaf .
and this is chocolate .
and this could be whipped cream .
maybe from a milkshake ?
no , it was a coffee drink -- likely frozen .
but ma doesn &apos;t serve frozen , chocolate , minty cappuccinos .
&quot; frappuccino &quot;
is a portmanteau of &quot; frappe &quot; and &quot; cappuccino . &quot;
do you ever worry that you &apos;ll sound pretentious ?
no .
what about &quot; tank &quot; ?
oh , my god . it &apos;s gonna be a long day .
another portmanteau .
&quot; tommy &quot; plus &quot; frank &quot; equals &quot; tank . &quot;
hang on . we &apos;re being interrupted by something relevant .
hello , susie .
uh , hello , detective .
the victim &apos;s tox screen .
this is strange .
phil taylor had extremely high levels of warfarin in his blood .
what &apos;s warfarin ?
an anticoagulant .
which mr. taylor &apos;s medical records
indicate that he wasn &apos;t taking .
warfarin is also used in rat poison .
when &apos;s the last time
we had someone commit suicide by rat poison ?
never .
well , i think we have ourselves a homicide .
start in the kitchen first .
okay .
oh . where do you think you &apos;re going ?
so , you weren &apos;t actually having a heart attack , huh ?
it was gas pains .
sorry to disappoint you .
okay , this is now a crime scene ,
so i need the both of you out of the cafe
so we can collect evidence , please .
was he murdered ?
he was poisoned .
ohh , how awful !
i found this on a food @-@ prep counter .
so ? where there &apos;s food , there &apos;s rats !
it contains warfarin .
okay , that &apos;s rat poison , stanley ,
and that &apos;s what killed your customer .
so if any of that ended up in his food ,
you &apos;ll be charged with negligent homicide . let &apos;s go .
no , i &apos;m an innocent man , unjustly accused !
and i need a statement . one from you , too , ma .
you &apos;re not under arrest , so sergeant korsak will take yours .
let &apos;s go .
i have the right to remain silent !
anything i say can and will be used against me .
yeah , keep talking , stanley .
i love a reason to arrest you .
you &apos;ll be hearing from my lawyer !
okay . nice talking to you , too .
you think this is the end of this abusive use of power ,
you got another think coming , rizzoli !
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i thought he was gonna start shouting &quot; attica ! &quot;
sure does a lot of protesting
for a guy who knows nothing about a missing breakfast .
okay , so , what do we know about our victim ?
he was single , he lived alone .
but he had a son ?
no . according to his family , that &apos;s not his kid .
they don &apos;t know who it is
or why his photo was in phil &apos;s wallet .
well , that &apos;s weird .
victim was a big pharmaceutical executive .
lost his job five years ago .
was doing temp work for a pharmaceutical distributor .
and you have no idea why he had your number , korsak ?
nope .
notepaper was from st. avitus .
they have an a.a. meeting almost every day .
there was one at 6 : 00 a.m. this morning .
well , that &apos;s right nearby .
maybe he came in early
and had breakfast while he waited for you .
jane , can i talk to you ?
yeah .
hey , frost , come on . let &apos;s go check out st. avitus .
what &apos;s the matter ?
lydia took the baby .
hi . my name &apos;s larry . i &apos;m an alcoholic .
hi , larry .
i spent so many nights in the drunk tank ,
i thought i &apos;d save some money and get my law degree .
it turned my life around .
now i &apos;m &quot; larry the cadillac lawyer . &quot;
got my office in the trunk of my car .
so , if you slip and fall , you can come and find me --
and my caddie .
thanks for letting me share .
five @-@ minute coffee break , okay ?
recognize anyone ?
she looks familiar , but ... i can &apos;t place her .
vince !
great seeing you , too .
oh , come on , vinnie .
you really don &apos;t recognize me ?
i ... know we know each other .
we did .
oh , god .
detective frost , this is my first wife , dana .
oh , hi . wow .
uh , how do you forget your wife ?
oh , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s been a while .
40 years .
and we were only married for three weeks .
well , it was a year , actually ,
but i spent most of it in vietnam .
i still owe you an apology .
no need . it was so long ago .
dana , we need your help .
phil .
is he in trouble ?
he &apos;s dead .
how ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
he was just here this morning .
he comes here almost every day .
my name and number were in his wallet .
did you give them to him ?
yes .
i talk about you sometimes .
let it go , dana . i have .
why did you give him my number ?
he said he needed a cop he could trust .
but he didn &apos;t say why .
do you know who this is ?
i have no idea . no .
was phil close with anyone here ?
no . not really .
oh , wait . wait .
he had just started hanging out with a woman .
i don &apos;t know her name .
can you give us a description ?
mm , 40s , blond ...
tall , thin , unhappy .
that &apos;s really all i know .
thanks .
good to see you .
you too .
oh , yeah , really good .
hey , what was your name , again ?
no , i understand .
thanks for your help , dan .
okay . that was the a.d.a.
it &apos;s what i thought --
as his mother , lydia has a legal claim .
she holds all the cards .
what about tommy ?
we didn &apos;t get the paternity test back yet .
a relative can file a motion for temporary guardianship .
okay .
but it &apos;s a three @-@ month wait for a hearing .
which means t.j. goes into foster care .
we can &apos;t do that to him .
lydia does seem a bit hapless , but she doesn &apos;t seem evil .
i mean , i don &apos;t like her ,
but t.j. &apos; s definitely better off with her
than being bounced around in the system .
frankie , you don &apos;t think she &apos;d hurt him , do you ?
no way -- i wouldn &apos;t have let her take him
if i thought something was gonna happen to him .
well , what about lydia &apos;s mother ?
lydia said that she doesn &apos;t like babies .
maybe we should try to get him .
what ? you would like to raise t.j. ?
sort of , yeah .
i mean , not full time . just ... some of the time .
i don &apos;t know ! we should tell ma .
well , tommy wants to tell her
once he gets the paternity @-@ test results .
stomach @-@ contents results
came back positive for high levels of warfarin .
which means that the portal of entry
is the food that he ate .
okay , so we need to get that food .
frankie , will you get the csru techs ,
go through the garbage ?
ma said the victim had a breakfast special .
you want me to look for
his scrambled eggs and half @-@ eaten pancakes ?
are you kidding me ?
it doesn &apos;t look like she is .
please ? !
the culprit could also be the coffee ,
although the cafe doesn &apos;t serve chocolate @-@ mint coffee .
okay , so put a disposable coffee cup
on your treasure @-@ hunt list .
thank you !
okay , is that why you moved the bookshelf ?
so you could see all the dead bodies come in ?
yes . isn &apos;t it convenient ?
oh , yes . i &apos;m forgetting all my troubles .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t recall your name .
alex . alex simmons .
i haven &apos;t been doing many shifts lately --
not since i started medical school .
wonderful . congratulations .
thank you . it &apos;s a lot of work ,
but it &apos;s what i always wanted to do .
dr. isles , is that
a casandra strickenberg ?
uh , why , yes , it is .
how did you know ?
her giveaway is the trapunto effect in the appliqus .
love the hand @-@ stitching . such gorgeous fabric .
with an eye like that ,
maybe you should &apos;ve considered fashion design .
actually , i love to sew .
i &apos;m lucky -- great fine motor skills .
i also knit , crotchet , and bead .
bead ?
yeah .
cool .
so , alex , why don &apos;t you tell us about the victim ?
lucy cox , 32 .
found dead in her apartment in dorchester .
no signs of visible trauma .
bloody mucus .
i &apos;ll have to do a gram stain for the sputum .
the paramedics note how long she was ill ?
a week ?
neighbor said she was at home from work with a bad cough .
significant pleural effusion .
splinter hemorrhages .
oh , no .
i &apos;m gonna tell you both something very frightening ,
but i don &apos;t want either of you to panic , all right ?
maura , what is it ?
hold your breath and move as fast as you can to the crime lab .
we have a code red .
go now !
come on . i &apos;m asking you to list the possibilities .
all right ? that &apos;s not guessing .
jane , try to stay calm .
i &apos;m calm .
it &apos;s my imagination that &apos;s hysterical .
is it ebola or leprosy or die @-@ before @-@ lunch syndrome ?
ebola is a possibility .
so is sars , anthrax , dengue fever ,
west nile virus , drug @-@ resistant tuberculosis ...
i &apos;m captain green , incident commander .
i need to know your level of exposure .
limited physical contact , possible aspiration .
remove your clothing . place it in these bags .
shower with the decontamination soap .
change into the tyvek suit .
ohh . i &apos;ve only worn this casandra strickenberg once .
oh , how awful .
yeah , it &apos;s a real tragedy .
you need to take a decontamination shower .
wh--
where &apos;s the stall ?
well , now is no time to be modest , jane .
the longer you delay ,
the more chance you have of becoming infected .
well , this is awkward .
sorry . medical school .
i &apos;m exhausted . it &apos;s killing me .
but --
what ? !
you want your tyvek now ?
yeah . i can &apos;t wait to wear it .
i would also like about a hundred more of these tiny towels .
okay .
i am officially offended .
this is interesting .
wha--
what ? that alex fell asleep while i was naked ?
he &apos;s obviously not into women .
no , i &apos;m talking to an official from the cdc .
no reports of any hemorrhagic viruses
anywhere in massachusetts .
that &apos;s great news .
but there &apos;s an outbreak of bacterial meningitis in boston .
is that treatable ?
yes .
there &apos;s a gram stain test coming back soon .
alex ! are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine , babe .
oh . so he &apos;s not into women ?
hello ? i &apos;m the one that has to supervise him .
i did a striptease in front of my morgue tech .
oh , no worries . he wasn &apos;t watching .
i didn &apos;t know you two were together .
we &apos;ve been keeping it a secret .
i hope that &apos;s okay .
there &apos;s no policy in place about dating coworkers .
oh , yeah , no . you can shower in front of them .
you guys okay ?
we &apos;re fine . thank you .
yes , we &apos;re fine . just peachy .
i love being jane the bubble girl .
frankie , you didn &apos;t tell ma about me or the baby , right ?
you kidding me ?
did you find the food ?
no . i &apos;m sorry .
bring me up to speed on the case .
jane , it can wait .
susie , is that the gram stain test ?
it &apos;s bacterial meningitis , dr. isles .
oh , that &apos;s wonderful .
yay ?
you are free to go .
yes ! whoo !
thank you . that &apos;s ... far enough .
thank you .
captain green , you didn &apos;t by any chance happen to keep
the casandra strickenberg , did you ?
my skirt .
ah . it was just about to be autoclaved .
i stopped them .
oh , thank you .
good job .
yes . what a relief .
welcome back .
you think it &apos;s weird for a guy not to recognize his ex @-@ wife ?
not if he &apos;s had a head injury .
that explains so many things .
stop , would you ? it &apos;s almost 40 years ago .
she looked different .
oh ! okay . i get it now .
she doubled in size .
where &apos;s detective cooper ?
the drug unit borrowed her back .
for how long ?
mm . a while .
riley must be bummed .
jane !
i found it .
you found what ?
okay , you know how mr. stanley
has a &quot; no outside drinks &quot; policy ?
i have not memorized the caffe &apos;s penal code , no .
well , i remembered the dead man told me
mr. stanley made him throw out his coffee .
and i found his
mint @-@ chocolate fro @-@ cap in the lobby garbage .
ma , this -- this is great .
okay , maura &apos;s got something .
what the heck ?
it &apos;s dana . she wants to talk about phil &apos;s murder .
i &apos;ve really been wrestling with myself .
a.a. works because
everything you say is safe .
it can &apos;t be repeated .
dana , phil taylor was murdered .
it &apos;s possible the killer
was someone he met at one of those meetings .
phil said he ruined a life .
whose life ? did he say ?
a little boy &apos;s .
when he shared last night ,
he said he was finally ready for justice to take its course .
do you think maybe he was coming here to turn himself in to me ?
i don &apos;t know .
he was scared .
dana , exactly what did he say ?
he said he had blood on his hands ,
that he made another terrible mistake --
worse than the boy .
he said he couldn &apos;t live with himself
until he made it right .
that &apos;s all he said .
any idea how long he &apos;d been coming to meetings ?
we just gave him his five @-@ year chip .
thanks . that helps a lot .
vince .
i &apos;m really sorry i didn &apos;t wait for you .
it &apos;s my biggest regret .
a lot of guys got &quot; dear john &quot; letters .
it &apos;s okay , dana .
i &apos;m glad you got help , straightened your life out .
it &apos;s safe .
it is so clean in here ,
you can eat off the tables .
let &apos;s not , maura .
bacterial meningitis doesn &apos;t survive its host &apos;s death .
results on the contents of the coffee cup .
it tested positive for high levels of warfarin .
thank you .
alex is very nice .
yeah , he said the same about you .
he couldn &apos;t believe how
comfortable you were being naked around him .
really ? he noticed ?
this might be a little too much information for my boss ,
but we met at a nudist retreat .
if you want to join us sometime , that would be ...
well , many illnesses can be improved with nudity
and some vitamin d.
psoriasis , for instance .
is there hiking ?
hiking ?
well , less likely to contract lyme disease if you &apos;re not wearing any clothing .
thank you . that sounds heavenly , susie .
we &apos;ll let you know .
really ?
aren &apos;t you the one that was worried
about stripping in front of your morgue tech ?
well , now that i know he &apos;s a nudist ...
results , please .
the cup tested positive for warfarin .
that is how our victim was poisoned .
too bad . i was really hoping to arrest stanley .
not today .
okay , so , phil guzzles rat poison in his fro @-@ cap .
i &apos;m guessing he didn &apos;t taste it
because of all the chocolate and the mint ?
1,500 calories in a mint fro @-@ cap ?
no wonder he has so much adipose tissue .
50 boston joe &apos;s in the city .
which one sold him his fro @-@ cap ?
phil must have been talking about this boy .
why else would he have this photo in his wallet ?
well , he started going to a.a. five years ago .
right about the time he lost that big pharmaceutical gig .
maybe his company knew something .
frost , did you check phil &apos;s driving record ?
yeah . it was clean .
looks about 8 years old .
maybe we try running hit @-@ and @-@ runs over the last five years .
look for one that involves a young boy .
okay .
so , vince , how &apos;d it go with dana ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means , did you remember her ?
oh . yeah .
we made love on the interview @-@ room table .
why would you put that image inside my head ?
okay , here we go --
hit @-@ and @-@ run five years ago on phil &apos;s block .
the victim was an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy --
jimmy flores .
look at the newspaper photo .
what happened to jimmy ?
he was paralyzed .
was phil ever a person of interest in the hit @-@ and @-@ run ?
pulling up the police report .
police interviewed phil once .
says his lawyer was with him .
lawyer told police phil &apos;s car was stolen .
jane , uh --
tommy wants us to meet at your apartment after work .
frankie , we &apos;re in the middle of a homicide .
fine .
then don &apos;t blame me
when you &apos;re investigating tommy homicide tomorrow .
you probably should go .
okay . i will be there .
thank you .
so , phil confesses to having blood on his hands
and needing to make something right .
and the next day , he &apos;s dead . so , what did he mean ?
let &apos;s start with his fro @-@ cap .
there &apos;s a boston joe &apos;s right next to st. avitus .
go . i &apos;ll keep digging .
take korsak .
he needs a minty fro @-@ cap after working up a sweat
with that wife he couldn &apos;t remember .
dana dumped you when you were in vietnam ?
she met somebody .
okay , that &apos;s terrible .
and i &apos;m glad she doubled in size .
hi . can i help you ?
hi . boston homicide . do you recognize this man ?
oh , sure . that &apos;s &quot; five @-@ pump minty extra . &quot;
five pumps with extra chocolate .
was he in here early this morning ?
he &apos;s here early every day .
did you see &quot; five @-@ pump &quot; with anyone ?
yeah -- &quot; double @-@ tall , nonfat , no @-@ foam latte . &quot;
and what does &quot; double @-@ tall , nonfat &quot; look like ?
tall , skinny blonde . sourpuss .
dana mentioned a woman
that phil hung out with at a.a. meetings --
blond , tall , thin , unhappy .
yeah , she &apos;s always complaining .
says she can taste caramel in her latte ,
so she has me make it again &apos; cause she doesn &apos;t do sugar .
so explain to me why she was pouring all that sugar in today .
did she take &quot; five @-@ pump minty &apos;s &quot; drink , too ?
i think so .
excuse me .
i have a triple @-@ tall , no @-@ foam , extra @-@ whip ,
half @-@ chocolate , half @-@ caramel fro @-@ cap at the bar .
i &apos;m guessing that wasn &apos;t sugar that &quot; double @-@ tall &quot; was pouring into
&quot; five @-@ pump minty &apos;s &quot; fro @-@ cap .
ma , i &apos;m so sorry .
i just don &apos;t understand .
we just can &apos;t walk away from that baby .
i talked to lydia .
is she gonna share custody ?
no , she says she can &apos;t forgive herself for abandoning mario .
&quot; mario &quot; ? you named him mario ?

the paternity test came back .

tommy &apos;s a baby daddy .
i @-@ i told you what i did .
i mean , i can &apos;t be a father to him .
he almost got killed .
oh , tommy .
he rolled off your chest .
i dropped you once .
oh , my god !
is that what happened to him ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i was rocking him , and i fell asleep .
you were fine .
you , uh ... bumped your lip .
i cried . you cried .
and look -- it &apos;s all okay .
tommy , it &apos;s all right , okay ?
we &apos;ll all help you .
yeah . come on , tommy . man up .
lydia &apos;s mom says they &apos;re coming after you
for child support , anyway .
well , i &apos;m gonna pay child support .
i &apos;m no dead beat dad .
okay , good .
but i don &apos;t have a steady job ,
and lydia and i aren &apos;t a couple .
tommy , we want t.j. in our lives .
so do i.
all right .
so you fight for joint custody .
tommy ...
there &apos;s another way to do this .
well , if she says she has a plan , she has a plan .
yeah , but i think we all know about my mother &apos;s planning .
that &apos;s where tommy got his &quot; planning &quot; abilities .
oh , if it doesn &apos;t work out ,
you can always use defense condition one .
um , i @-@ it &apos;s much cooler if you say &quot; defcon one . &quot;
def ... con ... one .
much cooler .

i need to confess ,
and i &apos;d prefer to do it in the proper surroundings .
oh , i can &apos;t wait to hear what you have to say .
yeah , let &apos;s go -- upstairs .
that camera better be on ,
because i don &apos;t want you twisting my words .
i &apos;m old enough to remember the watergate tapes .
talk . we &apos;re in the middle of a murder investigation .
i did it !
you killed phil taylor ?
i hid key evidence in a homicide investigation .
i should be punished to the full extent of the law .
you took the food ?
where is it ?
why did you take it ?
i panicked !
i didn &apos;t want the cafe to be blamed ,
so i grabbed it .
and then , when it became a murder --
no , this is very serious , stanley .
i hope you have a very , very good legal team .
division 1 cafe was my life &apos;s work .
you people are ...
you &apos;re family .
no kidding ? family ?
just like in a real family ,
you don &apos;t always like all your relatives .
yeah , i know exactly what you mean .
god , i wish there was something we could charge him with .
what ?
you &apos;re free to go .
i am ?
yeah .
yeah , on one condition .
two conditions .
you give mrs. rizzoli a raise .
and you stop calling her &quot; rizzoli ! &quot;
this is from the doorway into the boston joe &apos;s .
okay , that &apos;s phil .
yeah , and see the woman ?
yeah . who &apos;s she ?
i &apos;ll see what i can do with facial recognition .
okay , i &apos;d like to know what they &apos;re arguing about , too .
no help there . no audio .
hey , frankie ?
yeah ?
come in here .
frankie can read lips .
really ?
yeah , he spent a lot of time on the bench
when he started little league -- reading coaches &apos; lips .
i got really good at it .
got good at benchwarming , too , huh ?
tell him .
tell me what ?
aw , doesn &apos;t matter .
yes , it does !
he was an amazing ballplayer ,
and he was on his way to the professionals .
wow . i &apos;m sorry .
blew out my arm . thrower &apos;s elbow .
so , what do you need ?
tell us what he &apos;s saying .
uh , okay .
he &apos;s saying ... &quot; i didn &apos;t sign up for this . &quot;
didn &apos;t sign up for what ?
looks like he &apos;s saying ,
&quot; i didn &apos;t know men in tights would kill people . &quot;
a @-@ mazing .
how does he do it ?
wait . no .
&quot; i didn &apos;t know mennonites would kill people . &quot;
well , there &apos;s a mennonite killer out there .
not helping , frost .
whoa . this is .
got a hit on facial recognition .
alice vanderbilt .
let &apos;s go pick her up .
alice has a nice house .
it &apos;s in foreclosure .
hey , guys .
that &apos;s car exhaust .
engine &apos;s running .
i need an ambulance at 1429 pinecrest drive .
she &apos;s dead .
she &apos;s dead .
cause of death is carbon monoxide poisoning .
okay , alice &apos;s fingerprints were on
the car keys , the hose , the doors .
it &apos;s a suicide , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
all right , so maybe we &apos;re looking at a murder @-@ suicide .
phil and alice , they hook up at a.a.
phil dumps her . she kills him .
hello , alex .
dr. isles .
hey , susie said you might be joining us camping .
huh ? no . i can &apos;t .
my skin burns so easily .
it does not .
so , alex , what do we have here ?
victim -- brian radcliff , 31 .
i think it might be another case of bacterial meningitis .
i think you might be right .
the cdc is reporting more cases of meningitis in boston .
meningitis . oh , my god .
frankie wasn &apos;t saying &quot; men in tights &quot; or &quot; mennonites . &quot;
jane ?
jane ?
right there .
he &apos;s saying , &quot; i didn &apos;t know meningitis would kill people . &quot;
that &apos;s why he wanted to talk to me .
i &apos;m still not getting how the mennonites in tights
killed the people with meningitis --
or what that has to do with you , korsak .
yeah , me either .
you got me . let &apos;s go through it again .
phil taylor was a big pharmaceutical executive ,
gets fired , takes a crap job distributing pharmaceuticals .
alice vanderbilt was a quality @-@ control lab tech
at rampvex pharmaceutical industries .
alice had an m.d. ?
maybe that &apos;s how she was able to afford that nice house .
that &apos;s in foreclosure .
her bio says she was a successful anesthesiologist
before she closed her practice .
to become a lab tech ?
what did alice do ?
is her medical license still current ?
no . she hasn &apos;t renewed it since 2009 .
but she keeps an open application on file .
okay .
did our two victims with meningitis
have any connection to each other ?
both were young professionals
who worked in the financial district .
i found a needle @-@ puncture wound with a contusion
on the right bicep of the man who died of meningitis .
so you &apos;re saying he was injected ? with what ?
a flu vaccine .
okay , wait a minute . this is starting to make sense .
does rampvex manufacture flu vaccines ?
yeah .
so , maybe alice contaminated the flu vaccines .
and phil distributed them .
but why would you infect people with bacterial meningitis ?
it &apos;s treatable .
same reason somebody tainted tylenol -- create fear ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
maura , why would two healthy ,
young professionals die if it &apos;s a treatable illness ?
well , they only died because they had underlying problems --
compromised immune systems .
otherwise , it would &apos;ve just made them very ill .
pain and suffering -- plus , they can &apos;t work ,
all because of a bad flu vaccine ?
and rampvex , the manufacturer , has deep pockets ?
but who &apos;s gonna sue ?
neither of our two dead victims were married .
oh , you &apos;re worth a lot more ill or gravely injured than dead
when you &apos;re single .
so , phil and alice created their own class @-@ action lawsuit .
but they were the bad guys . they couldn &apos;t file the lawsuit .
they could if they had one more partner --
a lawyer .
hey , frost , is phil &apos;s lawyer &apos;s name
in the hit @-@ and @-@ run report ?
no .
but alice &apos;s medical @-@ license application lists her lawyer .
what do you know ?
it &apos;s a lawyer we &apos;ve met , frost .
hi . my name &apos;s larry .
hi , larry .
and i &apos;m an alcoholic .
why don &apos;t you tell them the truth , larry ?
you came here to troll for clients .
hey , i &apos;m in the middle of my share .
what is going on ?
larry here isn &apos;t actually an alcoholic .
he just likes taking advantage of people
who are trying to make their lives better .
what the hell ?
you met phil and alice here
and came up with a great scheme .
hand over the keys to that big cadillac outside .
we need to have a look at your &quot; office . &quot;
let me see a warrant .
let me see the keys .
it &apos;s like christmas .
hey , those are private mementos .
&quot; did a bad flu vaccine give you meningitis ?
larry the lawyer can help . &quot;
yeah .
helped two young , innocent people into an early grave .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s in phil &apos;s file .
you think that &apos;s from the night he ran over jimmy flores ?
oh , you are sentimental .
you kept the license plate from phil &apos;s &quot; stolen &quot; car .
what mementos did you save from alice ?
no , he handled alice &apos;s malpractice suit
after her drinking killed a few of her patients .
hey , i was trying to help my clients . they were desperate .
yeah , desperate to get their livelihoods back .
too bad your scheme went a little haywire
when you and alice realized phil had a conscience .
yeah , alice had one , too -- she killed herself
when people started dying from your tainted vaccine .
this looks like a lot number for the bad vaccine .
it &apos;s such a good thing
that you lawyers keep such tidy records .
i &apos;ll call public health , make sure they seize them .
you &apos;re under arrest for murder
and conspiracy to commit murder , mr. bukowski .
hello .
hi .
nice to finally meet you in person .
i don &apos;t know how to apologize enough
for all that i &apos;ve put you through .
what about me ?
you too .
okay . let &apos;s start fresh .
we are so glad that you could join us for dinner .
yeah , what are we having ? i don &apos;t like spicy .
think you &apos;re gonna like being called &quot; grandma &quot; ?
by tommy jr . ?
yeah . i think i &apos;m gonna like it .
i like getting another shot at this .
yeah , i didn &apos;t do so bad with lydia , did i ?
this baby provides us an opportunity
to , uh ... start new .
yeah .
can we get you something to drink ?
water for me .
which one of you is the doctor ?
i am .
i need that stuff -- uh , makes you sick if you drink .
antabuse . i can write you a prescription .
can you believe it ?
all because of this little guy .
if you get tired or you need to go to the bathroom or anything ,
i &apos;d be happy to hold tommy jr .
oh -- &quot; t.j. &quot;
here .
he likes it when you mush him against your breasts .
i bet he does . i still like that .
tommy .
what ?
what do you do for a living ?
lots of things .
yeah . that means you don &apos;t do nothing .
oh , well . least your ma &apos;s nice .
tommy &apos;s a good guy .
yeah . he is .
and i just want to say ... i &apos;m here for t.j.
we all are .
oh , my gosh .

i don &apos;t like spicy .
