it &apos;s time to bring nsa surveillance state to an end .
fisa courts are a rubber stamp to trample
on your fourth amendment right to privacy .
sorry . you all right ?
oh . no , no , no . my fault .
&quot; kill the patriot act . &quot; it &apos;s never gonna happen .
the best we can hope for is --
fix section 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 5 . i know .
hyperbole piques their interest ,
then you go in for the kill .
we could use more petitions like this .
oh thank you .
your involvement means more than you know .
yes . we &apos;ve achieved customization .
initiate phase 2 .

did you know that this diner claims to have
the third @-@ best cup of coffee in d.c.
look , last night ,
me coming by your place like that and --
liz , i want to ... say something .
don &apos;t , please .
i mean , can &apos;t you just tell me about your boat ?
i mean , whatever the other thing is ,
i &apos;m sure that it &apos;s ...
probably best for both of us if you just keep it to yourself .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just want to say i &apos;m sorry .
tom , we &apos;re way past that .
i know , but i &apos;m not asking for your forgiveness .
i just want to apologize
because i should have done it a long time ago .
what &apos;s the catch ?
there &apos;s no catch .
it &apos;s just a little hope .
hope ?
mm @-@ hmm .
that what , we &apos;ll just work through
this screwed @-@ up situation we &apos;re in
and go back to playing house ?
all right , dream scenario . uh @-@ huh .
we finish our coffee , we hope on my boat , we leave .
okay , we never look back .
preferably , we take our clothes off at some point .
be serious .
i am trying to be .
that &apos;s insane .
i don &apos;t know you -- not the real you .
and the fact that you think
i &apos;m gonna run away with whoever you are
means that you don &apos;t know me at all , either .
hmm .
you must be the toast , bacon extra crispy , tea , 2 % .
thank you .
i thought you &apos;d be hungry .
just because i &apos;m eating this --
all right , look , i know the whole naked boat thing
is a little unrealistic ,
but we both need to start over , right ?
you and me .
the real me , not --
the neo @-@ nazi ?
&apos;cause that doesn &apos;t really do it for me .
that &apos;s fair .
reddington .
don &apos;t .
tom .
try calling me ... jacob .
i have to go .
i know you think he knows something ,
but i wouldn &apos;t bet the double @-@ wide .
my guess ?
the boy don &apos;t know doodle .
oh , the boy knows more than doodle , brimley .
i &apos;ve received information from my sources
confirming that karakurt is in @-@ country .
i &apos;m gonna need a bag of dry ice
and five feet of vinyl garden hose !
that poor fellow &apos;s an aide at the russian consulate
and a loyal errand boy for the cabal .
i believe he &apos;s the one
who provided karakurt with a go @-@ bag
upon his arrival in the states .
there &apos;s something i want to make clear with you .
karakurt is known in the intelligence community
as the left hand of the svr .
it &apos;s not enough for you to tell me that my mother was kgb
and that i was born in russia .
in truth , he works for the cabal .
they smuggled him into america because they know
if he commits an act of terror here ,
your government will blame moscow .
my mother and my father , who they are ,
what happened in the fire --
i &apos;m gonna find out the truth .
i &apos;m sure you will , lizzy . but listen to me .
the cabal is orchestrating .
i get it .
the cabal is trying to start another cold war ,
and an act of terror committed here
is step one in making that happen .
i am listening to what you are saying ,
and i know that it &apos;s important ,
but it is no more important than what i am telling you ,
and i need you to listen to that .
there will be an attack
on an american defense installation
within a matter of days .
if i &apos;m right , it &apos;ll be the first of many acts of terror
here and overseas designed by the cabal
to further their agenda .
we have to stop this man , lizzy .
january , 2009 -- stanislav markelov ,
a celebrated human @-@ rights lawyer
known for his criticism of the regime
is gunned down in moscow .
the russians blamed neo @-@ nazi youth .
but german intelligence suggests
it was karakurt acting on orders from the svr .
four years later , boris berezovsky ,
another vocal critic of the regime ,
was found dead of an alleged suicide .
again , intelligence sources indicate
the death was staged by the kremlin .
is reddington saying that the svr
has sent a terrorist to america ?
no , that &apos;s what the cabal wants us to think .
whatever karakurt was sent here to do ,
the american government will believe
that it was on behalf of russia .
it &apos;s a false @-@ flag operation meant to strain relations .
reddington said that karakurt &apos;s target
was a defense installation . did he identify which one ?
no . but i think he might have a lead .
he &apos;s just being tight @-@ lipped about it .
why ? we &apos;re trying to help him .
reddington doesn &apos;t trust our security .
he thinks we &apos;ve been bleeding information
since before the attempt on his life .
well , we &apos;re not waiting on reddington .
i &apos;ve already reached out to langley ,
set up a consult with the c.i.a. &apos; s office of russian and european analysis .
this karakurt must be on their radar .
find out what they know .
华盛顿特区
mr. masik .
how &apos;s it going ? marshall .
donald ressler . elizabeth keen .
that was kilpatrick . he &apos;s on his way down .
man , you guys certainly got his attention .
the whole team &apos;s coming down to hear this .
piece of advice -- kilpatrick &apos;s tough .
do not take anything he says personal .
all right , let &apos;s go . everyone stop what you &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s our lucky day , apparently .
the good people of the fbi have decided to enlighten us .
kilpatrick . i spoke to harold cooper just now .
and he sent over a situation brief .
ressler . keen . we appreciate you guys extending yourself --
you want to tell us where you got your information ?
a high @-@ level informant . one who &apos;s proven very reliable .
karakurt . you sure that &apos;s what he said ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re talking to people
who run russian counterintelligence ,
and we don &apos;t have one shred of credible information
that he &apos;s in @-@ country .
well , that &apos;s why we &apos;re here --
to share our credible information with you .
we were hoping you guys would do the same .
look , you have your hooks in the russian community .
that &apos;s right .
and if their top assassin is on u.s. soil ,
you can bet your badge we &apos;d know it .
he &apos;s here .
and we have reason to believe he &apos;s planning an attack
on american defense installations soon .
if civilians die
because you &apos;re bent out of shape
whether the source was f.b.i. or c.i.a. --
you asked for our assessment .
no . we asked for your help .
if he &apos;s here , where does he go ? who does he meet with ?
he needs a place to stay , a vehicle .
we &apos;ll ask around .
you &apos;ll ask around ?
that &apos;s it ?
there are stars carved in the marble at langley
that represent colleagues of ours
who died drawing intel on karakurt .
nobody wants him more than we do .
we &apos;ll look into your lead and let you know .
hey , guys , wait up .
like i said ,
the guy &apos;s not exactly the warm @-@ and @-@ fuzzy type , huh ?
the guy &apos;s a prick .
he &apos;s actually not . overworked , yeah .
under @-@ appreciated , definitely . alcoholic , probably .
but killy &apos;s been working the russians
ever since they were soviets .
what he doesn &apos;t know , somebody he knows does .
the truth is we reviewed what you sent on karakurt ,
and it &apos;s as much as we &apos;ve gathered
since he came on the radar in &apos; 03 .
you guys really have nothing suggesting
that he &apos;s in the u.s. ?
nothing solid .
kilpatrick has a c.i. here in washington .
part of the old guard , hard @-@ liner .
owns a restaurant now
popular with some of his ex @-@ pat spy colleagues .
he recorded a conversation for us last night .
cryptic stuff . we &apos;re not sure what it means yet .
you think it might be karakurt ?
well , it fits in with some of what you &apos;re looking for .
now , if you take this ,
it didn &apos;t come from me .
thank you . we &apos;ll be in touch .
hey . can you help me with something ?
katarina rostova
- you heard of her ?
i don &apos;t know who that is ,
but i doubt very seriously that
that is katarina rostova .
i don &apos;t think there are any photographs
of katarina rostova .
why do you say that ?
she &apos;s a myth .
tall tales late at night over vodka shots .
probably an amalgamation
of a half @-@ a @-@ dozen unknown female soviet operatives --
the pinko mata hari .
you said your c.i. works with the old guard .
could you ask him about her for me ?
if anybody knows anything about
katarina rostova , he will .
send me a copy of your photo .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
you were right to keep on him .
the boy was tighter than my first wife .
but i got an address .
all clear .
ammonium nitrate .
he &apos;s constructed some kind of anfo i.e.d.
he &apos;ll need a vehicle .
hello ?
hello .
hi . is he still here ?
the man who was in the room ?
i wanted to apologize before he moved .
my baby has colic and was fussing all night .
oh , dear . you must be exhausted .
yeah , you have no idea .
ah , you &apos;d be surprised .
the man , did you talk to him ?
yeah , we passed in the hall , said hello .
i feel terrible .
oh , no . don &apos;t be silly .
if you could give me a call the next time you see him ,
i would be ever so grateful .
&quot; bill houston . &quot;
y @-@ you &apos;re a private investigator ?
he in some kind of trouble .
according to the missus , always .
gambling .
he lost his daughter &apos;s college fund
playing caribbean stud , left home in embarrassment ,
helen &apos;s worried sick . it &apos;s a mess .
you said he was moving ?
people here don &apos;t stay long .
i mean ,
i saw him with a truck in the alley .
what kind of truck ?
reddington didn &apos;t give it to me .
i found it in one of the places he stays .
and you think this is a photo of your mother ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s what reddington told me .
but that girl , that is definitely me .
the agent back there , the c.i. he mentioned ?
that could be my chance to find out something
about the woman holding me in that photo .
why would a russian c.i.
have information about your mother ?
ressler .
where are you ?
just leaving the orea . why ?
reddington called .
karakurt is in possession of an anfo i.e.d.
we &apos;ve identified the vehicle .
it &apos;s a white moving truck
rented out of annapolis ,
plate number delta @-@ kilo @-@ 5 @-@ 8 @-@ 2 @-@ 7 .
机动车辆 安纳波利斯dk5827 商务车
we &apos;re trying to ping the location now .
they think karakurt has a white moving truck
with explosives .
oh , my god .
the truck is parked right outside of orea .
orea is the target .
liz ! liz , look out ! the truck !
crews continue the grim work of sifting through the rubble .
the death toll stands at 14 , although the identities ..
this was an act of terror , plain and simple .
as chairman of the select committee on intelligence ,
mark my words .
we will find the people who are responsible .
and when we do , we will respond with all appropriate force .
it &apos;s official . no survivors .
i got something .
security cam from a loading dock on 20th and independence .
it &apos;s not much , but let &apos;s send it wide ,
see if we can &apos;t get lucky , get an i.d.
keen .
you &apos;re okay .
i was afraid you were ... inside .
no , but those agents -- their entire section .
every agent on that desk was wiped out .
if this gets traced back to russia -- - not &quot; if , &quot; lizzy .
senator hawkins has taken the bait
like a bluegill to a cricket .
and where he goes , the warmongers are sure to follow .
where are you on karakurt ?
where ? nowhere .
the cabal just took out
an entire substation of the c.i.a.
they put a bullet in your chest ,
and you have no idea how .
you &apos;re the most cautious person i know .
the fbi couldn &apos;t find you for 20 years ,
but they did .
they &apos;re three steps ahead ,
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m gonna tell the a.g.
tom connolly is there ?
no , he &apos;s on his way .
i assume he &apos;s expecting to be briefed .
connolly made the harbormaster investigation go away .
all we have on karakurt is a recording
and a grainy photo that &apos;s gotten us nowhere .
you have far more than that .
like what ?
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re safe , lizzy . i &apos;ll be in touch .
mr. houston ?
the man with the truck , he &apos;s back .
reddington has a location for karakurt --
63rd and franklin .
coordinate with hrt . roll out now .
we have a lead .
we need to talk in your office .
tom .
you will ignore reddington &apos;s lead .
why ? i &apos;m sure it &apos;s solid .
harold , call your team .
tell them intel indicates the russian is at union station .
you expect me to let karakurt get away ?
the man murdered 14 government agents .
and that is a national tragedy ,
but finding him will not bring them back .
what about his next target ?
how many more lives does he have to take
before you let me do my job ?
your job today is to divert your team to union station ,
or , god forbid , your wife will pay the price .
charlene is a lovely woman
who violated the espionage act ...
for you .
prison will not be kind to her .
harold , let him go .
this is bigger than both of us .
ressler .
we received actionable intel
that conflicts with reddington &apos;s .
yeah , but keen said that he had an eyewitness .
local p.d. got a hit off the credit card
karakurt used to rent the truck .
the same card was used
to purchase a train ticket at union station .
redierct there now .
copy that .
i knew you &apos;d make the right play .
give charlene my regards .
华盛顿特区
check the platforms .
i &apos;ve got eyes . going through gate d.
keen , what &apos;s your 20 ?
hey , hang on . you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m okay .
what happened ?
he blind @-@ sided me .
okay . where did he go ?
i didn &apos;t see .
the intelligence committee is receiving live updates
on the progress of the investigation
from the justice department .
all evidence points to a deliberate ,
sanctioned attack from russia &apos;s svr .
it was karakurt .
he was there . you &apos;re certain ?
i don &apos;t know . he came around the corner .
i @-@ i just got a glimpse of him .
i was calling ressler for backup when he knocked me down .
hey , guys . listen to this .
from the recording agent masik gave you .
tell me it worked .
the proof of concept succeeded as projected .
prepare to initiate phase two .
done .
i &apos;ve identified the markers
for targeting and customization .
whatever &apos;s happening , it is happening soon .
what does he mean by &quot; markers &quot; ?
could be referencing map coordinates ,
some kind of radio beacon . we don &apos;t know .
but based on what agent masik told you ,
we think we &apos;ve figured out who the c.i. is .
he told you that the owner runs a restaurant in d.c.
that caters to the soviet old guard .
we reviewed ownership records
for all the russian restaurants in d.c. and found one .
ninoshka &apos;s . the owner is former spetsnaz .
his name is anton velov . my belief is he &apos;s the c.i.
the conversation was recorded last night ,
so we pulled all the receipts
and found a late dinner for two
paid for by a leo andropov .
dr. leo andropov .
and you think he was meeting with karakurt ?
i &apos;d say yes . andropov worked for the soviet defense ministry
in the final months before glasnost .
whiz kid .
when he was 16 , he published his first and last paper
in an open @-@ source microbiology journal
before he got snapped up by the weapons ministry .
closet &apos;s clear !
i &apos;ve seen equipment like this at the lab at quantico .
this is a genotyping unit .
it looks like andropov fled .
no passport , no i.d. , no prescription drugs .
building fertilizer bombs is way below this guy &apos;s pay grade .
this can &apos;t be karakurt &apos;s endgame .
biological weapons ? this guy &apos;s a virologist .
if these are biological weapons ,
then we may be looking at a pandemic .
it always starts with a favor .
i &apos;ve known tom connolly for two decades .
he &apos;s had dinners at my house .
and when he offered to help me get into that drug trial ,
it was my only hope .
it wasn &apos;t just your hope , harold .
it was your wife &apos;s hope , you children &apos;s .
you were given a terminal diagnosis ,
and connolly ends up offering you a choice --
your life or your ethics , and you picked your life .
what good are ethics
if you aren &apos;t alive to live by them ?
if it was just me , my health , my life ,
i would have told him to pound sand a long time ago .
when he dragged charlene into it -- now this --
deliberately misdirecting my own agents
to facilitate the escape of a terrorist !
now , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting .
he orders you to send them to union station ,
ostensibly to throw them off karakurt &apos;s trail .
and there he is .
perhaps agent keen was mistaken .
and assaulted by a total stranger ?
that makes even less sense .
it was some kind of ambush .
and i sent my people right into it .
and a good thing you did .
what the hell does that mean ?
thanks to your desire to protect charlene ,
we &apos;re presented with a unique opportunity
to find out what the cabal is up to .
how ?
by continuing to follow connolly &apos;s orders
without question .
the last thing you should do is confront him .
gather evidence . build a case .
tom connolly &apos;s been leaking information to the cabal
about everything that goes on in this place
ever since he walked through that door
and offered to save your life .
you want to wipe that debt clean ?
keep your eyes open and your mouth shut .
we found a fully outfitted virology lab
in andropov &apos;s apartment .
think he &apos;s building a bio @-@ weapon .
we seized his notebooks ,
but we &apos;re gonna need an expert in microbiology
who can also translate russian .
reddy bear !
i could eat you alive !
ginger , this is dr. lauren kimberly .
lauren , my executive assistant , ginger lumire .
interesting look .
purposeful , but still feminine .
you should try a darker shade of lipstick .
i bet you could get away with a gloss .
lauren , we &apos;re going to have to forgo the makeover today .
we &apos;re in a bit of a pinch .
understood . let me see what i can do .
i &apos;ve got a lead on my mom .
an orea agent , he has a c.i.
who might know something about katarina rostova .
dr. kimberly was a tenured professor
doing genome research at stanford
when she was recruited by the private sector .
i &apos;m gonna find out the truth .
she makes her real money consulting .
costs a fortune .
she did , however , let me name a lipstick color --
&quot; fire in the hole . &quot;
you &apos;ve reached elizabeth keen .
please leave your message at the tone .
hi , liz . this is , uh , jacob .
jacob phelps .
look , i know things are complicated .
i know you &apos;re going through a bad breakup .
but from what i heard , the guy &apos;s a total loser .
couldn &apos;t cook , made crappy pancakes .
so i wanted to see if you would join me for dinner tomorrow .
uh , i made a reservation at 7 : 00 at this great little place
on the corner of 32nd and m , and i hope that you will come .
or not .
but , uh , either way , i &apos;ll be there .
you &apos;re right . it is a weapon .
a w.m.d. ?
no . a w.i.d. --
a weapon of individual destruction .
this is a customized virus ,
synthesized with the sole intent
of killing one specific individual .
how is that possible ?
he &apos;s created a supercharged rotavirus .
these are very common .
by the age of 5 , most of us have been infected multiple times .
and with each infection , we build up an immunity .
so it &apos;s harmless to most people .
all people . precisely .
but this rotavirus has been customized ,
keyed to infect one individual
with a unique genetic sequence , and to devastating effect .
according to the animal trials logged in these notes ,
it attacks the central nervous system
within minutes of exposure .
one person .
but who ?
i can only tell you what they &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t tell you who they &apos;re doing it to .
so , we know karakurt is targeting one person
and it &apos;s keyed to his or her dna .
think .
he bombed the c.i.a &apos;s russian section .
that took time , money , and no small amount of risk .
what happens when the united states is attacked ,
suffers grievous loss of life ?
we go into lock @-@ down .
the bombing bumped the ntas level to red .
but why put the mission at risk
by triggering a high @-@ level terrorist alert ?
well , that &apos;s the downside .
the upside is exposure , public attention .
remember , the people behind this
went to immense trouble and expense .
what does that say about their target ?
he &apos;s high @-@ value .
someone important .
oh , my god , that &apos;s why he did it .
the memorial service .
the victims will be memorialized at a service
at ascension and saint agnes church .
politicians and military personnel ,
intelligence officers from overseas
will all be there to pay their respects .
one of them is the target .
so , this is the guy ?
that &apos;s the best we can do .
he &apos;s our prime suspect in the orea bombing ,
and we have good reason to believe that he &apos;s not done yet .
we need your people to be on high alert .
we &apos;re looking for a bomb ?
no , we &apos;ll be prepared for that possibility ,
but our intel says he &apos;s after a specific target .
we just don &apos;t know who yet .
we &apos;ll do our best , but with this many people around ,
i can &apos;t promise anything .
safest play is to cancel the event .
believe me , we &apos;re working on it .
just spoke to reven wright .
calling off the memorial service is a nonstarter .
that &apos;s a mistake . we have hard evidence of a clear threat .
main justice is aware .
but the public &apos;s rattled by this bombing ,
and they want a show of strength .
if they cancel , it suggests we can &apos;t protect our own people
on our own turf .
maybe we can &apos;t -- at this point , we still don &apos;t know
exactly what we &apos;re dealing with .
i can tell you what i &apos;m dealing with -- an impossible problem .
so if you &apos;re counting on me cracking this virus , don &apos;t .
well , what do you have ?
we found the formula for the virus
in karakurt &apos;s apartment .
so my plan was to reverse engineer the process .
we are trying millions of dna combinations .
if i could figure out the profile it was engineered to destroy --
you could run the profile through the dna database .
if you get a match , that &apos;s karakurt &apos;s target .
except it won &apos;t work -- not in time , at least .
i need hours -- days , maybe --
and the memorial will be over long
before we can i.d. the target sequence .
whatever his plan , we have to assume
karakurt &apos;s already infected himself with the contagion
and is a live carrier .
civilian and military security assets
have been marshalled for the service .
however , the assassin in this case
is not armed with something
that we can flag with a metal detector .
the virus is transmitted through touch .
it penetrates the skin .
even brushing up against the target
is enough to infect and kill him .
it is critical that we nail karakurt
before he can get anywhere near that church .
find him , people ! whatever it takes !
what are you thinking ?
not me , leonard .
the director . what is he thinking ?
his objective is to exacerbate tensions with russia .
he chose to send karakurt ,
an assassin known to work for the regime
so people will assume russia is responsible .
so ...
so whoever he &apos;s targeting next will be an enemy of russia ,
an outspoken critic .
someone people will believe
the russians would want to silence .
hey , keen ! keen !
67 guests have been cleared to attend .
there &apos;s defense , homeland ,
cia , the bureau on this list .
it &apos;s gonna be hard to narrow it down .
yeah , so much for the good old days
where you could just look for the glint
of a sniper @-@ rifle scope in a nearby window .
what does it do , this virus , to the body ?
the cdc &apos;s still breaking it down .
but they &apos;re saying it attacks the central nervous system .
a victim would start shaking within seconds of infection .
disorientation , then labored breathing , convulsions .
incapacitation within moments of contact .
it &apos;s quite a remarkable feat of engineering .
in my experience , such accomplishments
don &apos;t happen overnight .
you &apos;re saying they tested it first .
a customized virus
deadly to such a small fraction of the population --
what kind of trial and error would prove useful ?
this is aram .
agent mojtabai , i need a list of people
admitted to an emergency room in the last few days
displaying symptoms consistent with the virus you &apos;re tracking .
okay , that &apos;s not gonna be so easy to put together .
aram , that kind of catastrophic trauma
would certainly have gotten someone &apos;s attention .
it &apos;s on an autopsy chart somewhere .
okay , i hear you , but you have to --
bethesda general sent tissue samples
to the cdc a few days ago .
a suspicious death of a college student .
the center &apos;s just starting an investigation .
i need that student &apos;s home address ,
and i need to speak to agent navabi .
mrs. jennings , thank you for seeing me .
i know this is an extremely difficult time .
i got a message from the cdc about the investigation .
but i didn &apos;t think they &apos;d be sending someone over so quickly .
can you tell me about connor ?
what you know so far ?
not much .
connor was a law student .
i was told he was walking across campus
when he just started shaking , and then convulsing .
one of the doctors suggested
he may have contracted a rare form of rotavirus ?
no , you &apos;re right to be thinking
this could be something else entirely .
perhaps malicious .
malicious ?
to be honest , mrs. jennings ,
your son may have been intentionally infected .
is this because ...
is this because ... ?
if connor was targeted
by someone capable of this kind of attack ,
it has to be connected to his father .
his father ?
when i was a young staffer on the hill ,
i had an affair with the man i was working for .
we were stupid , and ... i got pregnant .
even then , he had his eyes set on a big political future ,
so i agreed to go away .
i made a deal to receive ongoing support from him .
senator hawkins -- he &apos;s the target .
they tested the virus on his son ,
the closest possible genetic match .
you need to find the senator before karakurt does .
hey , keen !
samar &apos;s reaching out to hawkins &apos; office .
he &apos;s not inside ,
so we still got a shot of keeping him clear .
i &apos;ll check the drive @-@ ups . any word from metro ?
negative . if karakurt &apos;s inside ,
nobody &apos;s spotted him yet .
step up , please . name ?
flemming , european wire ,

we &apos;re gonna need to check the case .
we &apos;re good .
he &apos;s on the main justice press list .
it &apos;s time , harold .
call tom connolly .
tell him you need to see him immediately .
i &apos;m assuming at the moment he has no idea
you &apos;ve identified karakurt &apos;s intended victim ,
which is why you need to tell him .
why would i do that ?
because he &apos;ll be caught off guard .
and in addition to enhancing your credibility with him ,
it &apos;ll make him doubt whether or not to move forward .
you think he &apos;ll call off the attack ?
i think it &apos;s worth the attempt .
what &apos;s the latest from agents keen and ressler ?
still no sign of karakurt .
agent navabi &apos;s on the line now with one of hawkins &apos; aides .
listen to me . it &apos;s not a potential threat .
the bureau has confirmed
that a direct attack on the senator is imminent .
no , i cannot confirm my source .
then you need to find whoever is with him
and deliver the message .
it &apos;s not safe to attend the service .
you need to find him .
you &apos;ll be third to the podium , senator .
after the minister and the family representative ,
they &apos;ll have a moment of silence , and then --
we &apos;ll be sitting here forever .
this is fine , patrick . i &apos;ll walk .
senator hawkins , how are you ?
welcome , sir .
thank you .
harold , your cooperation was instrumental
in karakurt &apos;s escape .
everything &apos;s on track , thanks to you .
don &apos;t thank me yet .
why ? is there a problem ?
my people are closing in on him now .
they know the orea bombing was just the first
in a series of attacks .
they know about the virus .
i see .
well , thank you for letting me know .
but why are you letting me know ?
and don &apos;t tell me you want to help
because i know you &apos;d like nothing better
than to strangle me right now .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m letting you know
because i want you to call it off .
i can &apos;t control reddington ,
and i can &apos;t misdirect my people again without drawing suspicion .
it &apos;s only a matter of time until they stop karakurt .
stop him from what ?
they don &apos;t even know his target .
clifford hawkins .
call it off , tom .
if the director really wants him dead ,
he can find another way on another day .
no . today is the day .
i appreciate your concern , but everything should be fine .
strange days , don &apos;t you think ?
assassins don &apos;t need knives or guns or bombs .
all you have to do is answer a few questions
and shake the wrong man &apos;s hand .
the press corps . get over there now .
i think karakurt may be posing as a reporter .
he &apos;s just pulling into the service now .
senator hawkins .
get him away ! get him away from us !
okay ! come with us , sir !
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
the man responsible for the orea bombing ...
karakurt ? i was briefed . was that him ?
we &apos;ll explain everything , sir .
right now , we need to get you to a secure location .
thank you .
please , call my wife , tell her i &apos;m okay ?
sir ?
sir !
we need to get him to a hospital now !
he &apos;s been infected !
sir !
bethesda says hawkins is critical .
they &apos;ve called in the hospital chaplain .
he didn &apos;t touch karakurt ?
no , sir .
then what the hell happened ?
karakurt &apos;s in holding .
we &apos;re gonna take a run at him and find out .
best i could tell ,
hawkins just melted down next to keen .
karakurt .
that means &quot; spider , &quot; right ?
kara @-@ what ?
look , i don &apos;t know what that is .
my name is jonas flemming .
i &apos;m a reporter for the european wire .
i live in rotterdam .
we &apos;re gonna try this again .
we know who you are .
that &apos;s you outside the orea .
you exited a rental truck less than a minute
before it exploded and destroyed the building .
we have a recording of you and andropov .
we know he engineered a drug designed to kill the senator .
we know you &apos;re infected .
no , no , no , no .
my credentials were taken from me when i arrived ,
but they were vetted by your department of justice .
please , call .
you didn &apos;t touch the senator .
how was the virus delivered ?
you can rig your little story ,
but you can &apos;t rig your blood .
we &apos;re running it right now .
and when it comes back positive
for that virus that killed hawkins , we got you .
hello , anton .
relax .
if i had bad intentions for this visit ,
you &apos;d know by now .
you &apos;re raymond reddington .
i am .
and if i &apos;m right , you &apos;re the same anton velov
who once led a spetsnaz special forces unit
called the zarubin group .
i &apos;m surprised we never met .
for many years ,
while you were still with u.s. counterintelligence ,
i considered you the kgb &apos;s greatest enemy .
oh , my god .
that feels like ages ago .
for what it &apos;s worth , i was young .
i had no concept of what a real enemy looked like .
but i do now .
which is why i &apos;m hoping
you and i might prove to be fast friends .
what can i do ?
i know you &apos;re working with the cia as an informant
for the office of russian and european analysis .
since those agents are tragically no longer with us ,
i was thinking perhaps you might become an asset for me .
your american government ,
they may not be done with me yet .
i got a phone call from fbi .
an agent named elizabeth keen .
really ? what about ?
she wants to meet .
she was asking about katarina rostova .
did you know katarina rostova ?
no , not personally .
all i know are the same old ghost stories we all share .
well , if you were in my employ , i would have to insist
you not speak to anyone from the fbi .
or any other u.s. intelligence agency .
of course .
and agent keen , she wasn &apos;t the first .
sometime back , two men from justice department
come and ask me about katarina .
i suppose they think i am one of the few people left
who still remember the old stories .
what sort of stories ?
they were asking about her kgb contacts ,
where she lived , and about a child .
they asked about a child ?
yes , many times .
&quot; tell me about her child . &quot;
i said , &quot; all i know is they say she had a daughter . &quot;
dembe , the phone .
how many times are we gonna go through this ?
that picture isn &apos;t me . call my office .
check my visa , check my identity .
we know you &apos;re working for the cabal .
we know what they &apos;re capable of .
was this the plan all along ,
to protect you with this identity ?
the cabal has people in the government all over the world .
it wouldn &apos;t be hard for them to create a jonas flemming ,
give him a history ...
the crime lab just called .
they &apos;re saying his blood tested negative for the virus .
negative ? that &apos;s not possible .
hey , i got to call you right back .
lizzy , you need to get out of there now .
why ? where are you ? what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;ve been set up .
the cabal &apos;s been asking about you , lizzy .
they know who your mother was . you &apos;ve been set up .
you were there when the orea building was bombed .
they wanted you to save clifford hawkins .
they sent karakurt to the memorial
to make you think he was the threat
so you would secure the senator
and infect him in the process .
i don &apos;t have the virus .
you do , lizzy .
i don &apos;t need a test to know that you do .
your mother was a russian spy ,
and now they &apos;ve made it look like you are , too .
you have the virus .
you infected the senator , and now they will come for you .
you need to get out of there now .
