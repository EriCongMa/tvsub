first man , walk to the far end ,
then turn towards the glass .
the rest of you , fill in .
number four , please step forward .
step back .
number five , please step forward .
number five , turn to your left .
that &apos;s him .
are you positive ?
absolutely .
i &apos;d never forget that face .
i &apos;m telling you , mcgarrett , it &apos;s all wrong .
i mean , it &apos;s like nobody &apos;s got time
to appreciate anything anymore .
take this spot they got over on kuhio .
calls itself &quot; quick cuts . &quot;
they actually advertise that they get you in and out
of the place in 15 minutes .
i mean , you go there , different person cuts your hair
every single time .
there &apos;s no personal touch , there &apos;s no familiarity .
sacrilege .
nothing wrong with a little healthy competition .
no , no , of course not , but it &apos;s bad for the culture .
you know , people forget .
the barbershop is an important social institution
in this country .
it &apos;s a community gathering place .
oh , my customers-- they come here , they hang out ,
they talk story .
no one &apos;s ever in a hurry to leave , and you know why ?
it &apos;s one of the last bastions
where a man can truly unplug from the world .
you know , even if it &apos;s just for a trim and a shave .
you with me , commander ?
yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah , i &apos;m with you .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just , uh ... it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s been a tough week .
hey , you got the couch . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m here to listen .
no . no , no , no , it &apos;s nothing . it &apos;s nothing .
no , no , no , no , no .
nothing &apos;s nothing--
this is about something ... come on .
well , yeah , it &apos;s about something .
it &apos;s about my mother , is what it &apos;s about .
we all got &apos; em .
yeah , not like this one , we don &apos;t .
ah , i hear you .
what do you think of the new place ?
i like it .
yeah ?
yeah , it &apos;s nice .
more space , less rent ...
it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
all right , this is cold , okay ?
but it &apos;s gonna help seal up those pores .
now just relax .
all right . nice ?
that &apos;s good .
then , i &apos;m gonna give you my special aftershave .
i cut up a little hibiscus ,
i toss it in there .
freshens up the skin .
nice , huh ?
how &apos;s that ? feel that ?
uh , yeah .
that &apos;s nice .
yeah .
real nice , buddy .
mahalo a nui , bruddah .
mahalo a nui .
you open up early ,
you sacrifice your morning paddle , all for my schedule .
i appreciate it . i &apos;m touched .
hey , man , my grandpa jack always said ,
&quot; this is a people business . &quot;
you clean up nice , mcgarrett .
not bad , huh ?
i like to think of myself as an artist .
you know , some canvases are better than others .
speaking of which , i would love
to get my shears on that partner of yours .
that cat got a hell of a head of hair .
i &apos;ve been chasing him around
with a pair of scissors for five years now .
he &apos;s very precious about that do .
trust me , but he &apos;ll be back in a week .
&quot; i &apos;ll tell him you offered .
solid .
so , what are we gonna do today ?
high and tight .
and don &apos;t touch the burns , right ?
yeah .
please , you got to help me .
they &apos;re coming to kill me .
that &apos;s right , keep your weight off it .
it &apos;s bleeding really bad , man .
give me a towel .
okay .
what &apos;s your name , kid ?
it &apos;s eran .
eran ? who shot you , eran ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
these guys .
what guys ?
i don &apos;t know . they had guns .
i saw them shoot someone . they killed him .
and now , they &apos;re after me .
call 911 .
i can &apos;t do that .
why can &apos;t you do that ?
i had a falling out with the phone company years ago ,
and i don &apos;t do cell phones , okay ?
here .
blue silverado across the street .
my cell phone &apos;s in there , all right ?
commander , i think we may have a problem .
what are you talking about ?
keep pressure on this , all right ?
yeah , we definitely have a problem .
oh , no . that &apos;s them !
take him behind the wall there , and stay down ; stay down .
stay where you are .
this is commander mcgarrett of five @-@ o.
drop your weapons .
we just want the kid .
hand him over , and we walk away .
that &apos;s not gonna happen !
you know the story of the three little pigs ,
commander mcgarrett ?
then you know this is going to end badly for you .
how can you not have a phone ?
all my regulars have standing appointments .
the rest are walk @-@ ins , okay ?
how could you leave yours in the car , commander ? !
&apos;cause this is the barbershop .
this is where we come to unplug
from the rest of the world , do you remember ? !
oh , yeah . now , you &apos;re gonna use my words against me ?
nice . kid , you got a phone ?
no .
of course not .
some days are just born bad !
thank god , chin .
look , i had nothing to do with these home invasions .
i &apos;m being railroaded here .
you got to believe me !
relax , jer .
eyewitnesses are unreliable ,
and duke told me that you were just a plant .
nobody thinks you &apos;re guilty .
we just need to play this out .
this is what i get for trying to make a little extra coin .
25 bucks to be a lineup stand @-@ in ,
and now i &apos;m gonna spend the rest of my life in the joint .
you are not going to jail , jer .
we just have to provide hpd with an alibi , so ,
were you with anybody last night
between the hours of 8 : 00 and 10 : 00 p.m. ?
yeah , i @-@ i was with max .
perfect . great .
so , sit tight , i &apos;ll be back .
and from now on , no more lineups , okay ?
what do you mean , you &apos;ll be back ?
you &apos;re leaving me here ? !
sop , jer . hpd is gonna want
to keep you here until your alibi checks out .
no , no , listen to me good , chin .
you walk out that door ,
you may as well find yourself another roomie .
i &apos;ve watched enough locked up abroad
to know i &apos;ll be doing 30 years
for a crime i didn &apos;t commit .
i &apos;ll be like the next hurricane , which would be cool
if bob dylan wrote a song about me .
bob dylan is not gonna write a song about you .
you &apos;re right .
his recent work &apos;s less political .
it &apos;s more introspective .
just promise me you &apos;ll look after my mom for me .
i promise .
now try to relax .
i &apos;ll be back .
how &apos;s his leg ?
still bleeding , man .
you got to pack that wound , and then put more pressure on it .
pack ? pack with what ?
what do you got ? you got gauze out there ?
what ?
cotton balls .
there &apos;s cotton balls right here on the counter .
hey , bring &apos; em in !
come and get the cotton balls !
all right , listen ... i &apos;m sorry , kid .
i got kicked out of the boy scouts for smoking weed .
okay ? i never done this before .
but okay , okay ? is that all right ?
here we go . all right , here we go .
easy , easy , easy .
you must be running low on ammo , commander .
you can &apos;t hold us off forever .
save yourself .
give us the kid .
hpd &apos;s gonna be here in a minute !
and trust me , they won &apos;t be low on rounds .
i don &apos;t think they bought that .
where &apos;s this door lead ?
hallway to the back door .
we got to get eran to the hospital , all right ?
i &apos;m gonna lay down cover fire ,
you guys get out of here .
what are you , insane ? you &apos;re not gonna come with us ?
their guns are bigger than yours , man .
the minute i turn my back and stop firing on these guys ,
they &apos;re gonna come in here
and they &apos;re gonna kill us , you understand ?
they &apos;re gonna track us down and kill us .
by now , somebody would have called in these shots fired .
i got enough ammo to hold &apos; em off
until hpd arrives .
well , what if nobody called the cops ?
why are you arguing with me ?
this kid &apos;s losing blood
while you &apos;re arguing with me , he &apos;s gonna die
if you don &apos;t get him to the hospital .
okay , all right .
i guess we &apos;re going , kid . you okay ?
one ... one ...
let &apos;s go .
two ...
two ! come on .
three .
three . let &apos;s go !
all right , here we go .
abort ! abort !
come on , easy .
okay , easy , easy , easy .
all right , all right , all right ... sit down .
all right , all right .
i &apos;m gonna fix that .
okay . i &apos;m gonna fix that .
what are you doing back here ?
why are you here ?
i came to say good @-@ bye .
they got guys out back .
i secured the door but we can &apos;t go out that way .
how long till those cops you were talking about show up ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a commercial area .
you &apos;re the only store open right now .
the closest residential isn &apos;t for a few blocks .
so i &apos;m thinking the hpd &apos;s gonna take a few minutes
to pinpoint our exact location .
seriously ? i think it &apos;s safe to say we &apos;re
the only shop on the island that &apos;s under siege right now .
how you doing on ammo ?
i think i got about three rounds left .
well , can we recycle these things ?
there &apos;s like a million of &apos; em in here .
i &apos;m gonna pretend you didn &apos;t just say that .
okay , i &apos;m just trying to help , all right ?
okay , you want to help ?
find us a way out of here .
the gate . we can secure ourselves inside .
what gate ?
i got a security gate outside . it rolls down at night
to keep the undesirables outside of my shop .
okay , i &apos;m gonna ask you a question .
what do you call these , huh ?
what do you call these guys out the front with the big guns ?
okay , forgive me for not mentioning it sooner , all right ?
i &apos;m not exactly thinking straight .
it &apos;s not every day i have bullets flying at my head .
is it automatic ? tell me it &apos;s automatic .
what do you think ?
all right , all i need is to open the front door ,
pull the gate down , and that &apos;s it .
all right , move fast , keep your head down .
on my mark .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
it means when i say go , go .
well say that , then .
okay , when i say go ... go .
good .
one , two ...
three .
fast enough for you ?
that was good , that was fast .
but you didn &apos;t say &quot; go . &quot; you said , &quot; one , two , three . &quot;
you said you were gonna say &quot; go . &quot;
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
hey , max .
oh , lieutenant kelly . to what do i owe this pleasure ?
what , you win a scratch @-@ off lotto , max ?
me ? no , no , uh , just another
successful sale on ebay .
you get cash for your ebay sales ?
it &apos;s an option . lieutenant ,
is thereanything i can assist you with ?
actually , yes .
you were with jerry last night and i ...
jerry ortega ?
uh ... y ... no , i wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m afraid i wasn &apos;t with him at all .
i haven &apos;t seen him for @-@ for a week ...
max . max ,
jerry said that the two of you were together and he is in trouble .
it &apos;s very important that you tell me the truth right now .
what kind of trouble ?
i &apos;m asking the questions , max .
fine . um ... we were together .
there was a magic : the gathering tournament .
i was merely there to witness the impressive skill
and gamesmanship of the players ,
while mr. ortega
had ... gambling on his mind .
and you gambled , too .
oh , uh , i @-@ i was gonna deposit the cash after work .
i ... i @-@ i &apos;m not proud of it ...
but i can &apos;t deny being swept up
in the competitive atmosphere .
i mean , the athletics on display
were top @-@ notch and one of the planeswalkers
was riding a hot hand . you could just keep on ...
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about
and i don &apos;t care about the gambling .
jerry has been accused of a string of home invasions .
one of which occurred last night
while the two of you were at your magic show .
tournament .
whatever .
you &apos;re his alibi , max .
i need you to give a statement to hpd .
of course . i &apos;m willing to do whatever it takes to help jerry .
great .
provided the gambling
doesn &apos;t go on my exemplary record .
i &apos;ll tell you what--
you make a donation to the hpd widow and orphans fund
and we &apos;ll just keep it between us .
you mean a percentage .
all of it .
that &apos;s what i meant .
drink this .
drink it . you got to stay hydrated , all right ?
am i ... am i gonna die ?
no , you &apos;re not gonna die .
we &apos;re gonna get you through this , all right ?
here .
perfect .
wh ... what is that ?
it &apos;s a styptic pen . it &apos;s used to stop bleeding .
usually just nicks from shaves , but , uh , it might help .
it &apos;s gonna burn like hell , though , all right ?
we &apos;re gonna give it a try .
all right .
all right , that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s good . look at me , eran , look at me . look at me ,
look at me .
it hurts .
yeah , i know . i know it hurts ,
but you got to forget about that , though , okay ?
forget about the pain . think about something else .
this morning-- what happened this morning , eran ?
talk to me about this morning . everything you remember .
i @-@ i work
the a.m. shift at the ...
at the hoapili bakery on palolo avenue .
okay .
i ...
i , uh , i went out back to dump the trash
from the overnight crew and i saw
a couple of men in the alley .
they ... they were beating on this guy .
but they ... they didn &apos;t know i was there .
what happened after that ?
they ... they executed him .
just ... shot him right in the head .
i @-@ i panicked , dropped the trash ,
and ... they saw me .
so i ran as fast as i could .
i keep thinking i should have done something .
you know ? maybe ...
maybe that guy would still be alive .
listen to me , these men that you saw in the alley
did you recognize them ?
yeah , but i ...
i don &apos;t know any of their names .
just @-@ just that they &apos;re part of some armenian gang .
they pretty much run my whole neighborhood .
now they know where i work , my face ...
even if i get out of this ...
i &apos;m dead .
no , you &apos;re not .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen , all right ?
and you &apos;re not bleeding anymore , either .
that &apos;s two bits of good news .
you got any duct tape ?
who doesn &apos;t have duct tape ?
okay , get me a roll of duct tape , get me a fresh towel ,
all right ?
you got it .
how you doing ? you all right ?
hey , you &apos;re doing great .
all right .
mcgarrett .
you all right ?
you , uh ... ever hear the name garig dobrian ?
no .
used to be a major player in the armenian mob in l.a. ,
moved down here a few years ago to hang his own shingle .
word is he &apos;s ruthless .
drugs , shakedowns , insurance scams--
got his hands in all of it .
he owns the rainbow valley supermarket
over on palolo avenue , but , uh ,
that place is just a front .
wait a minute , you think dobrian
had something to do with this guy getting killed ?
well , nothing gets done without him giving the order .
and if he &apos;s the one who told these guys to come after eran ,
they ain &apos;t gonna stop till he &apos;s dead .
that can &apos;t be good .
he &apos;s coming over here . i &apos;m gonna open the gate .
you shoot him .
what am i gonna shoot him with ?
i don &apos;t have any bullets .
what the hell &apos;s he doing ?
central to 2 bravo 156 .
anonymous 911 callers reporting gunfire
in the vicinity of the 1200 block of queen street .
calls being received as far away as the 2000 block .
156 , 10 @-@ 4 from ward and queen .
great , great , great , great , great , great , great .
see this mug ? i got this in munich .
i spent the evening with one of the most beautiful
frauleins i &apos;d ever seen .
one of the top five nights of my life .
i ...
you hear something ?
no .
well , why are you shushing me ?
because i &apos;m trying to hear something .
really sorry i dragged you into this .
uh , you ... you were the only place open .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
don &apos;t sweat it , kid .
it &apos;s all just stuff .
nothing that can &apos;t be replaced .
hey , you &apos;re lucky you stumbled in here .
you got hawaii &apos;s finest on your side .
now we just need some of that luck
to get us the hell out of here .
bravo 156 going portable at the 1200 block .
10 @-@ 4 , bravo 156 .
cops . thank god .
no , no , there &apos;s something ... something &apos;s not right .
something &apos;s not right .
they knew i was a cop ,
they didn &apos;t hesitate to open fire .
what , now they &apos;re just gonna let one roll up ?
well , maybe they saw him coming and took off .
no way . no way . buddy , hey ! hey !
hey , buddy , get out of there !
it &apos;s a trap ! it &apos;s a ... get out of there !
central to 156 . what &apos;s your status ?
put him in the trunk .
what &apos;s your status ? what &apos;s your status ?
156 to dispatch .
we have a 10 @-@ 8.60 .
all right , 10 @-@ 4 , 156 . you &apos;re good to go . go .
hey , what ... what &apos;s 10 @-@ 8.60 mean ?
it means no one else is coming .
great .
just great .
get rid of it .
so i sent max down to hpd
to give his statement , and i started looking
into these home invasions that jerry &apos;s been accused of .
there &apos;s a disturbing trend .
all three women were robbed over the past few days ,
and each incident was more violent than the one before it .
last night &apos;s victim was sent to the hospital
with a fractured skull . she &apos;s still in the icu .
we gotta stop this before the next victim ends up on
a metal slab in front of max .
okay , so what do we know about the victims ?
well , they all live in different neighborhoods ,
they all work in different fields ;
two of the three grew up on the mainland .
but they do have one thing in common .
they &apos;re all recently divorced and living alone .
safe and easy targets .
okay , so , two divorced women is a coincidence .
three is a pattern . that must be how he &apos;s choosing them .
so , the next step is figuring out
how our guy knows that they &apos;re all recently divorced .
well , divorce records are filed down at the family court .
whoever did this probably has access .
look at that .
all three women used the exact same law firm--
kaio and reed .
莫瑞森大街1240号 火奴鲁鲁 96810
莫瑞森大街1240号 火奴鲁鲁 96810
莫瑞森大街1240号 火奴鲁鲁 96810
somebody inside that law firm is behind this .
morning .
$ 180.65 .
eran ain &apos;t looking too good , man .
yeah , that &apos;s why we got to get him the hell out of here .
where &apos;s that lead to ?
that &apos;s the a / c unit .
i &apos;m telling you , there &apos;s only two ways out of here .
okay , listen to me , all right ?
the hpd is not coming anytime soon ,
which means we &apos;re on our own .
and waiting any more is no longer an option .
the longer we stay here ,
the better the chance we all end up dead .
okay , what are you gonna do ?
you gonna crawl through the , uh , air duct ?
yes , if i have to , yes .
there &apos;s a store next door , right ?
a florist .
i &apos;m thinking this connects to the florist ,
and if i can get over there ,
maybe i can use their phone and call 911 .
you see where i &apos;m going with this ?
help me .
oh ... careful . please .
i &apos;m sorry . all right ?
奥德尔 · 马丁
what is this ? you &apos;re a lawyer ?
yeah , i &apos;m a lawyer . is that so hard to believe ?
well , i mean , it &apos;s a barbershop , so , yeah , kinda .
i just blew your mind , didn &apos;t i ?
you know , most people hang it on the wall , you know .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not too fond of mine ,
and i just haven &apos;t had the nerve
to toss it in the trash where it belongs , okay ?
there &apos;s a story there .
there &apos;s a long and boring story there ,
one that ends up with me owning a barbershop
on a rock in the middle of the pacific .
do me a favor ? you got a phillips ?
uh , yeah .
so , what , you spend 100 grand on a degree ,
but you realize you like breaking the law
more than practicing it ?
i think we &apos;re done talking about this .
what are you talking about ? i told you about my mother .
you didn &apos;t tell me anything about your mother .
okay , well , she aided and abetted a man
who was trying to kill me for years ,
and then she went into hiding ...
so i couldn &apos;t call her on it .
your turn .
my father &apos;s a big @-@ shot defense attorney .
park avenue penthouse ,
summers in the hamptons ,
first @-@ class everything .
but that &apos;s not where he came from ,
and he resented the fact that he was a barber &apos;s son .
he didn &apos;t consider that a noble profession .
all that matters to him is how much money you make .
he sent me to all the best schools--
horace mann , nyu ,
fordham law .
didn &apos;t matter what i wanted .
he was calling the shots .
after i graduated , i had enough-- wela ka hao .
life &apos;s too short , huh ?
yeah .
getting shorter by the minute .
that is not encouraging .
no . it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s too small a space for me to fit into .
so what are we gonna do ?
uh , guys ... ?
guys !
they &apos;re coming in .
what ?
what do you mean &quot; they &apos;re coming in . &quot; ? how ?
we need to get him into the storage room .
let &apos;s go .
up , up .
go !
you sure this is gonna work ?
hair dye &apos;s got peroxide .
aftershave &apos;s , like , 60 % alcohol .
might as well be scotch .
trust me , it &apos;s gonna burn .
so you &apos;re a barber , you &apos;re a lawyer ,
and you &apos;re an explosives expert ?
yeah , my grandpa jack
was a barber stationed in england during wwii .
uncle sam liked the boys cleaned up
before heading to the front lines .
he was assigned to the combat demolition unit .
one of his regulars taught him
how to make a molotov cocktail
using hair dye and aftershave .
jack always said ,
&quot; a piece of knowledge is better than a good tip . &quot;
good thing you were paying attention , huh ?
there we go . done .
i &apos;m a pacifist . she &apos;s all yours .
you got a light ?
good luck .
odell !
huh ? we gotta move ! come on !
mahalo , grandpa jack .
neighbors are gonna be pissed .
all right , here , here .
this is commander mcgarrett of five @-@ o.
i have a 10 @-@ 15 at 1284 queen street .
i need an ambulance and all available units .
mcgarrett !
okay .
breathe , breathe , breathe .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
but we got no time to wait for an ambulance .
where &apos;s your car ?
across the street .
follow me .
let &apos;s go .
all right , guys , just hang in there .
it &apos;s almost over .
all right , listen to me--
get him to king &apos;s medical center
and take this , just in case .
i told you , i &apos;m a pacifist . i don &apos;t do guns .
today , you do guns . take it .
you &apos;re going after garig dobrian , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
be careful , brutha .
now , go .
so i hear you had a very interesting phone call the other night .
gabriel waincroft .
guy thinks he did me a favor by killing coughlin .
he did .
by murdering that detective and then disappearing ,
he single @-@ handedly ended ia &apos;s investigation against you .
you know that sick son of a bitch
is gonna want something for it now , right ?
he didn &apos;t say .
not yet .
you know what , the only thing i owe that guy is a set of cuffs .
all three women had different attorneys
working their divorce , however ,
one of our clerks , levi papani ,
assisted on all of the cases .
my assistant &apos;s getting him now .
we appreciate that .
so , levi , how long &apos;s he been working at your firm ?
little over a year .
any problems ?
he &apos;s a good kid .
graduated top of his class at berkeley law .
we all think he &apos;s got a bright future here .
i was told you wanted to see me .
come in , levi .
this is lieutenant kelly and captain grover
of five @-@ o-- they have some questions for you .
actually , uh ...
i think there &apos;s been a mistake .
oh , yeah .
the man we &apos;re looking for is a really big guy ,
about 300 pounds , six feet ,
long curly hair .
you got anybody else at the firm who fits that description ?
not that i know of .
yeah .
actually ...
there is someone .
taua &apos;s my first cousin on my makuahine &apos;s side .
i got him a job in the mail room as a favor for my auntie .
i knew this was a bad idea .
why &apos;s that ?
he was always in trouble as a kid ,
getting in fights at school ,
in and out of juvie ...
oh , yeah , i can see why you &apos;d figure
you &apos;d get him a job at a law firm .
good thinking .
like i said , he &apos;s &apos; ohana .
my auntie swore he got his act together .
so far there hasn &apos;t been any trouble .
there he is .
taua lahani .
yeah ?
five @-@ o.
let &apos;s talk story .
i stuck my neck out for you .
put my reputation on the line .
and you decided to repay that favor
by going through your cousin &apos;s case files
and finding out a few clients who were
living alone , fresh off a big settlement .
i &apos;m thinking you saw an opportunity and you took it .
oh , you thinking about taking off ? go ahead , go ahead .
you take one step toward that door ,
i swear i will throw you a beating
you &apos;ll never forget--
big , strong guy like you
preying on defenseless women .
no , i don &apos;t think you got the stones to run , do you ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
all right , maybe the hair , but the rest of it ...
turn around .
get &apos; em behind your back .
&quot; jerry . &quot;
garig dobrian ?
yeah , that &apos;s me . who are you ?
commander mcgarrett , five @-@ o.
