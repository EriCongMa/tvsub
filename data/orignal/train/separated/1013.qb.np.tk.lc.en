why would neal run with three months left on a four @-@ year sentence ?
well , that &apos;s what we &apos;re wondering .
we &apos;re not gonna catch caffrey using roadblocks and ... wanted posters .
kate says &quot; adios &quot; to you at prison
and gets busy with her disappearing act .
missed her by two days .
you can get me out of here .
there &apos;s case law .
i can be released into your custody .
gps tracking anklet .
the new ones are tamper @-@ proof , never been skipped on .
let me see it .
the forgeries you caught me on , i signed them .
where ?
look at the bank seal under polarized light sometime .
apparently , if a tree falls in a forest , it does make a sound .
i may lose her again , moz .
lose her ? i just found her .
so did he .
kate ! kate !
so you know who has kate ?
i don &apos;t have a name , but i know this -- he &apos;s fbi .
so , the guy who has kate is in the fbi ?
apparently .
this confirms everything .
moz , take it easy .
if you lay down with dogs , you get up with fleas .
i could live without the fortune @-@ cookie commentary .
now you understand my fear of &quot; the man . &quot;
you &apos;re back with us , my friend .
the fearful masses -- welcome back .
suspects ?
how many field offices does the fbi have ?
56 -- not including resident agencies .
then i have a lot of suspects .
so how do we draw them out ?
we don &apos;t . it &apos;s his move .
morning , peter .
where are you ?
well , within my two @-@ mile radius . where are you ?
i &apos;m at my dining @-@ room table .
listen . we &apos;ve got a suspected jewelry heist .
i &apos;m intrigued .
meet me at 14th and 9th in 30 .
that &apos;s la joyau precieux .
i &apos;m even more intrigued .
the most expensive clothing boutique in the city .
of course you &apos;d know it .
you &apos;re gonna love this .
so , what do i do ?
nothing .
how about you ?
i suffer through another day of work .
and eat breakfast alone .
so , what happened at le joyau ?
don &apos;t know yet .
they called this morning and were a little light on the details .
they may or may not have been robbed .
so , they called the fbi , not the police ?
must be my dazzling reputation .
i don &apos;t know what could be so valuable at a clothing store .
well , hopefully , it has nothing to do with the promotion .
what promotion ?
they &apos;re displaying the world &apos;s most exotic pink diamond .
that might have something to do with it .
well , this is something you don &apos;t see every day ,
except maybe if you &apos;re you .
agent peter burke .
it &apos;s like buckingham palace .
no , i &apos;ve been to buckingham palace .
this is better .
agent burke ?
yeah .
this is a delicate situation .
i &apos;d appreciate if we could keep this discreet ?
keep what discreet ?
you were a little vague on your telephone call .
you &apos;re aware of this promotion ?
a display of the most exotic pink diamond in the world .
42 @-@ karat &quot; steinmetz pink &quot; set in platinum .
it may have been stolen .
you &apos;re worried it &apos;s a forgery ?
yes .
what makes you think it &apos;s a fake ?
follow me , please .
when i arrived this morning , everything was as it should be .
we removed the necklace from the vault ,
opened the show as planned .
later , when we were doing our mandatory review
of last night &apos;s security tapes , we saw this .
saw what ?
that &apos;s your vault ?
yes .
the necklace was stored there for 10 hours between
its arrival last night and the opening of the show this morning .
that &apos;s your first clue ?
why is the necklace still on the model ?
it &apos;s opening day . this is the promotional event of the year .
i don &apos;t care what it is .
you &apos;ve got a masked man entering your vault .
i &apos;m shutting you down .
let &apos;s go , folks ! the store is closed !
there &apos;s nothing to see here .
what &apos;s going on ?
you just became a very beautiful crime scene .
lauren , have all the models wait over there .
nobody leaves .
okay .
we &apos;re not positive it &apos;s a counterfeit .
our appraiser is still on a plane .
if it turns out to be a mistake ,
the amount of money we would lose ,
not to mention our credibility , would be ...
i &apos;ve got my own appraiser .
hello again . just ...
is it fake ?
he &apos;s talking about the necklace , right ?
it &apos;s beautiful work .
thank you .
guess that answers that question .
i need a closer look .
just take it off her .
i &apos;m trying to preserve the crime scene .
it &apos;s preserved .
thank you .
yep .
it &apos;s synthetic .
there &apos;s no such thing as a synthetic pink of that size .
it simply doesn &apos;t exist .
yes , pink is difficult to match .
it &apos;s only achievable using irradiation ,
which creates an extremely fine occlusion within the stone
that &apos;s virtually impossible to detect unless you &apos;re looking for it .
i don &apos;t know how this could have happened .
no one knew when the necklace was to arrive
or where it was supposed to be stored .
all right , you two ,
i &apos;m gonna need alibis from everyone who worked here
and anybody who knew the diamonds were in the vault .
what about our boy with the mask ?
do you have surveillance on how he got in ?
our security cameras only record
what happens on the floor and in the vault itself .
we don &apos;t record the hallways .
we have a back door , but the alarm was never triggered .
he must have tampered with the system .
do you think he hacked the alarm ?
hacked the alarm ?
oh , yeah , it &apos;s possible ,
if you could find the camera &apos;s blind spots and sneak past .
is that what you &apos;d do ?
it &apos;s one option .
all right , i &apos;m gonna confiscate your surveillance video , the necklace ...
and we will need you for further questioning .
what &apos;s it like to be a model ?
i bet it &apos;s fun . right ?
you &apos;re , like , walking around catwalks ...
caffrey .
it &apos;s legit .
e.r.t. is going over the alarm system .
this guy &apos;s a pro .
think they &apos;ll find any prints ?
no .
you okay ?
who is that ?
i don &apos;t know , but hughes doesn &apos;t look happy .
o.p.r. &apos; s here .
and that explains why .
o.p.r.
&quot; office of professional responsibility . &quot;
the police have internal affairs .
we have o.p.r.
hughes wants you in the office .
of course he does .
agent burke , this is garrett fowler .
o.p.r.
bad news travels fast .
yes , it does .
as far as anyone knows , he is here for a standard review .
yeah , because that line always works .
nobody &apos;s gonna buy that bridge today .
that &apos;s my file .
yes , it is .
impressive work .
i wanted to talk to you about the case
that you &apos;re currently investigating .
the jewelry heist ? why ?
well , the only people that knew that
diamond was gonna be placed in the vault
the night before the show were a few key
n.y.p.d brass and a handful of fbi agents .
you think it &apos;s an inside job .
and you already have a suspect , don &apos;t you ?
you know where neal caffrey was last night ?
am i being interrogated here ?
you &apos;re not .
look , this whole thing is a waste of time .
caffrey didn &apos;t do it .
he wears an electronic monitoring anklet .
it records everywhere he goes .
just pull it up .
yeah , we did that .
and ?
and some of the data from caffrey &apos;s
anklet is missing for last night .
missing .
went dark for six hours .
well , that &apos;s impossible .
that anklet can &apos;t be tampered with .
no , it can &apos;t , but ... evidently the database
where the information is stored can be .
someone wiped out six hours of tracking data .
then i suggest that you lurk around the u.s.marshals office ,
because they &apos;re the people who monitor that anklet .
caffrey belongs to the bureau .
that makes him our problem .
any leads ?
this is a short list of suspects
capable of pulling this off .
the best ones are already incarcerated .
this guy is dead .
okay . list just got shorter .
adrian tulane .
this is our prime suspect ?
yeah , it &apos;s a top @-@ notch forgery .
not many people are capable of this kind of work .
what about you ?
if i were legally allowed within 50
feet of the right equipment , maybe .
tulane &apos;s smart ... and a showman .
cameras don &apos;t scare him , and he has
the facilities to pull this off .
it &apos;s got his signature all over it .
all right .
let &apos;s talk to him .
what is with you ?
you &apos;re like a kid on a sugar high .
you don &apos;t understand . tulane is a legend .
legend ? no , don &apos;t oversell him .
it &apos;s like you meeting
eilot ness .
eliot n--
doing a puzzle with your girlfriend , huh ?
that &apos;s a nice , wholesome family activity .
how can i help you , agent ... ?
burke . fbi .
you &apos;re tulane ?
you know i am .
yeah . i do .
i want to ask you a few questions .
are you familiar with
the diamond necklace that was stolen from joyau precieux ?
yeah . that .
whenever something like this happens
i get a visit from someone like you .
that &apos;s why i try to be prepared .
you &apos;ll find plane tickets confirming i
arrived in the country this morning .
oh , and you &apos;re gonna love the photos
from my trip to madrid last week .
anything else ?
what &apos;s that supposed to be ? a cloud ?
no .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
stop grinning .
what ? the guy is slick .
let &apos;s hope he &apos;s guilty , too .
i &apos;m just curious .
the , uh , the uffizi job .
did you ... ?
right . right , right , right .
i love your alleged work .
big fan .
ugh , that was a bastard .
why are you disappointed ? this is the part you like .
moving the pieces . solving the puzzle .
i am moving the pieces .
what were you doing the night of the heist ?
went over some case files .
that &apos;s it ?
didn &apos;t hang out with anybody ?
june ? the short guy ?
i don &apos;t have an alibi .
look , i get it .
inside job , diamond forgery , o.p.r. &apos; s in town .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;m at the top of the list .
i am the list , aren &apos;t i ?
did you do it ?
come on , man .
did you do it ?
i didn &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m telling you the truth , peter .
hey , looking for me ?
yeah , i need you looking this .
it &apos;s forged bonds . some of caffrey &apos;s old work .
i need you to look at them under a
polarized light ... for a signature .
what ? neal &apos;s signature ?
yeah , when i arrested caffrey the second time
he told me he signed the bonds .
i want to know if that &apos;s true or if he &apos;s bragging .
okay .
is this , uh , related to our fake diamonds ?
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s not .
i appreciate the irony .
we &apos;re looking into them , and they &apos;re looking into you .
tell me what you got .
okay . i checked into peter &apos;s boss -- hughes .
this guy &apos;s a legend .
been with the fbi for 25 years .
they were forced to make him retire
but they found a loophole and brought him back .
skeletons ?
nada .
and i checked , uh , that agent
ruiz , who handles organized crime .
uh , lots of skeletons there , but i
don &apos;t think he &apos;s smart enough .
no .
i checked , uh , jones .
did you know his first name is clinton ?
checked into , uh , lauren .
you checked lauren ?
you said , &quot; check everybody . &quot;
then there &apos;s this guy from o.p.r. fowler .
what about him ?
used to work violent crimes for the bureau .
wife was killed during a robbery , and he took a year leave .
then he joined o.p.r , and his files were sealed .
sealed ?
interesting .
he showed up awfully fast after this went down .
have a ring ?
no . no ring .
tan line ?
no .
but that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not him .
i hope not .
o.p.r. is like this giant , sucking black hole
accountable only to the d.o.j.
department of justice ?
well , d.o.j. is just a euphemism , of
course , for the military industrial complex .
and big oil , right ?
goes without saying .
um , by the way , that necklace ...
yeah .
did you ...
i didn &apos;t take it .
because if you need a fence ...
moz . moz .
okay , okay . got it . i get it .
if we can &apos;t figure out how he stole it , we can
try to grab him when he goes to fence it .
it &apos;s a unique piece . it &apos;s too hot for the market right now .
brunei is an interesting angle
&apos;cause the market there is less rigid ...
yeah , the language barrier can be a challenge , though ,
&apos;cause one time ...
neal caffrey ?
you &apos;re under arrest .
what ?
we found the signature &quot; nc &quot;
microprinted on the fake diamond .
it matches the signature we found on the counterfeit bonds he made .
see ? it &apos;s good work , agent burke .
let &apos;s go .
stop .
he &apos;s my responsibility .
peter ...
neal ... you have the right to remain silent .
i didn &apos;t do this .
remain silent .
please .
all right . let &apos;s go .
you let me down , neal .
i let you down ?
you told fowler to look for my initials .
and you told me to look at your bonds under a polarized light , remember ?
well , guess what . i did .
and , yeah , you signed &apos; em .
and you think i &apos;d be stupid enough to do that again ?
i guess you were .
the thief is associated with a law enforcement ,
your anklet was tampered with ,
你的you have no alibi , and your initials are on the diamond .
what am i supposed to think ? !
i was set up .
by who ?
i &apos;m working on that .
you &apos;re not helping things .
agent burke .
what ?
his lawyer &apos;s here .
he &apos;s a lawyer ?
you can check my university of phoenix online degree .
go , cardinals .
now , if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to speak to my client ...
alone .
i didn &apos;t let you down .
all right . any problems ?
none . this was genius .
i don &apos;t know why we didn &apos;t think of this earlier .
and here the man is now .
agent burke .
yeah .
that was an excellent job yesterday .
appreciate the cooperation .
you know , caffrey was a great asset .
he did good work for us .
that may be , but don &apos;t forget , he &apos;s a criminal .
good job .
guys , i want to pull out the paperwork on , uh , 2b .
we have a problem .
caffrey &apos;s lawyer just requested every file the bureau has on him .
the judge ordered us to comply .
the judge actually raised his voice to the prosecutor .
&quot; open discovery .
turn over every document the government has on caffrey . &quot;
they &apos;re sending a truck .
all right . did you follow fowler ?
yep . once the request went through ,
he made a pit stop at a local dumpster .
he shredded these .
i knew it . thank you , moz . this is perfect .
uh , information on the judge .
wait .
he &apos;s got a private office not connected to the federal building ...
on mott street .
moz , i need you to liquidate some assets .
i need money .
why ?
i want you to buy a bakery .
so , all the tulane information checks out . he &apos;s eerily clean .
of course he is . what &apos;s neal &apos;s lawyer been up to ?
not much . legally we can &apos;t follow him .
attorney @-@ client privilege .
yeah , yeah .
so we have no idea what he &apos;s doing .
well , we do know he made a large real @-@ estate purchase in neal &apos;s name .
what ?
he bought a bakery ?
that &apos;s what it looks like .
why &apos;d he buy a bakery ?
we don &apos;t know . we don &apos;t even know where the damn thing is located .
all we have is a lease with a redacted address .
attorney @-@ client privileges .
yeah , covers a lot of sins , that one .
a bakery .
bakery ?
done .
construction .
finished .
how &apos;s the air @-@ conditioning in the judge &apos;s office ?
hmm , broke down this morning .
all right .
let &apos;s go to court .
hey , you .
you got my message .
i did . thank you .
i wanted you to have a familiar face here .
well , i &apos;ll take yours anytime .
so , uh , are you sure neal did this ?
yeah . i am .
of course , he says he was framed .
maybe he was .
ah , i wish it was true .
what &apos;s up ?
so , the arraignment &apos;s been moved .
why ?
neal said he &apos;s gonna confess .
so i guess you were right .
neal never confesses .
yeah , he said some important people were gonna be named ,
and he won &apos;t do it in an open court ,
so they moved the proceedings .
where ?
judge &apos;s chambers around the corner .
honey , i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
uh , get ahold of hughes .
bailiff , would you open a window ?
oh , the heat is stifling in here .
unfortunately , the air @-@ conditioning is not working today .
thank you . please , wait outside ?
per your request , mr.caffrey ,
the chambers have been cleared .
thank you , your honor .
in accordance with that agreement , you are now prepared to give a full confession ?
i am , your honor .
i &apos;ll admit i &apos;ve done a lot of things in my life that i &apos;m not proud of .
no . no , that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m proud of most of them .
but what i &apos;m about to do today ... this is gonna be good .
judge hickman &apos;s office .
fourth floor .
thank you .
bakery .
that son of a bitch bought that bakery .
i confess that i did not steal the diamond necklace from la joyau precieux .
i cleared these chambers
because you claimed to have sensitive information vital to this case .
if you didn &apos;t steal the diamond , then who did ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
bailiff !
somebody jumped out of a window and ran into a van !
he &apos;s not in the van .
get to the city planner &apos;s office .
find out where these tunnels lead .
burke !
caffrey escaped ?
yeah , did a four @-@ story swan dive
onto that awning of the bakery .
who approved moving the arraignment ?
the marshals guaranteed the security of the room .
never assume anything with neal .
you know , i &apos;ve been working my ass off keeping this kid on the straight and narrow .
he &apos;s been helping us win cases -- until you came along .
oh , don &apos;t put this on me !
hey , hey , gentlemen ! gentlemen !
hey , let &apos;s focus on the problem here .
what do we know ? did we stop the van ?
yeah . the only person in the van was the driver .
he claims he was hired through an anonymous internet posting .
500 bucks in an envelope to pick up the van and park it at this spot .
did the van have a floor panel that was removable ?
how &apos;d you know ?
caffrey wasn &apos;t in there for more than a few seconds .
he &apos;s gone underground .
can we track his anklet ?
no , they removed it when we arrested him .
okay . burke , find him -- again .
i &apos;m not comfortable with agent burke running this operation .
i don &apos;t care whether you &apos;re comfortable or not .
burke knows caffrey better than anyone .
now , get to work .
all right , burke . what &apos;s your plan ?
set up roadblocks , put up wanted posters .
so , to accommodate the location ,
we &apos;ll have to keep the guest list at about 200 .
yvonne , will you follow up on the caterer ?
it should be beautiful , though .
we &apos;ll have 10 long tables of 20 .
it &apos;ll be beautiful .
this is yvonne .
it &apos;s for you .
on your personal phone ?
burke premiere events . this is elizabeth .
sorry to bother you at work .
neal ?
uh , i &apos;ll catch up with you guys .
how &apos;d you get this number ?
stupid question .
you know , there &apos;s half the law enforcement in north america
looking for you right now , including my husband .
he &apos;ll find me soon enough . i need your help .
are you okay ?
ah , still haven &apos;t found neal .
we got a detail outside .
yeah , i saw .
as if he &apos;d be careless enough to come here .
where do you think he did go , el ?
is he in the kitchen ?
neal !
peter .
of all the places you could run ,
you go to my wife .
you say that like it &apos;s a bad thing .
you helped him sneak in .
well , i wouldn &apos;t have had to sneak him in
if there weren &apos;t those people sitting at our house .
you lied to the fbi .
honey , i did not lie to the fbi .
there was just a lot of
milk and cookies and pleasant ,
distracting conversation while neal slipped around the back .
i love this . you &apos;ve turned my wife into an accomplice .
give me one minute to explain .
one minute .
you explain what you were thinking
when you did a free fall from the judge &apos;s chambers ,
while i decide if i drag you back in chains .
okay , does that minute start now ?
go .
i told you , i was set up
by someone very close to you .
i couldn &apos;t tell you at first
because i thought it was somebody in the fbi .
now i &apos;m positive it &apos;s fowler .
fowler . that &apos;s not .
i got 52 seconds left .
i &apos;ve had a little free time on my hands the past few days .
so , i &apos;ve been putting these together .
they &apos;re documents fowler shredded
after i requested access to my files .
morning , peter .
where are you ?
within my two @-@ mile radius .
where are you ?
i &apos;m at my dining @-@ room table .
listen , we &apos;ve got a suspected jewelry heist .
i &apos;m intrigued .
meet me at 14th and 9th in 30 .
that &apos;s le joyau precieux .
i &apos;m even more intrigued .
the most expensive boutique in the city .
of course you &apos;d know it .
you &apos;re gonna love this .
i made that call from my home .
yep .
my god , they tapped my phone .
no . they didn &apos;t tap it . that would require a court order .
look at your phone .
it &apos;s a bug . standard bureau issue .
activates when you pick it up .
they &apos;ve been inside my house .
they couldn &apos;t have had authorization .
not within the window of the crime and his suspicion of you .
exactly . fowler is dirty .
peter , i have access to every file
the fbi has on me .
you had jones process a request to
look at my initials on the bond forgery .
after you checked the forgery to see if i was telling the truth ,
one other person checked it , too .
fowler .
and then my initials just happened to
show up on the pink diamond .
he &apos;s using you to get to me .
my minute &apos;s up .
i said i &apos;d give a full confession , so here it is .
i &apos;ve been trying to find kate .
am i supposed to look surprised ?
maybe .
i talked to her , peter .
i &apos;m familiar with this photo .
well , you haven &apos;t seen all of it .
she &apos;s being held by someone .
she &apos;s too scared to say who .
but after our chinatown operation ,
interpol told me
the man who has kate is with the fbi .
you think it &apos;s fowler .
i do now .
what &apos;s he want from you ?
i don &apos;t know .
could be anything .
like what ?
no .
no , you &apos;d have to arrest me .
i should be arresting you right now .
but you &apos;re not .
so give him what he wants .
if i do , there &apos;s no guarantee i &apos;ll ever see her again .
we need to look into fowler .
you &apos;re asking me to investigate o.p.r. that &apos;s suicide .
he &apos;s already investigating you .
we &apos;d have to go behind the bureau &apos;s back .
not if you clear me first .
it &apos;s what you do for a living , right ?
all right .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
this is untraceable .
but if for any reason you need to get in touch with me .
don &apos;t say another word .
i don &apos;t want to know where you &apos;re going .
plausible deniability ?
words to live by .
peter ...
what &apos;s the latest ?
we &apos;ve got conflicting intel .
i mean , we &apos;ve got reports of caffrey
sighted everywhere from jersey to geneva .
he &apos;s covering all his bases .
ah , he stole them right off the field .
you got a quick minute ?
yeah .
i just wanted to apologize about the other day , you know ?
i mean , we all want what &apos;s best for the bureau , right ?
of course .
hey , and let me ask you a question . just hypothetically .
if you had to guess , right now ... where &apos;s caffrey ?
probably trying to leave the country ... if he hasn &apos;t already .
oh , you don &apos;t think he &apos;d stay in manhattan ?
would there be a reason to ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just want to make sure we &apos;re using
our resources as wisely as possible , you know ?
like i said , roadblocks and wanted posters .
that &apos;s how we &apos;re gonna catch him , huh ?
it &apos;s a good start .
now , if you don &apos;t mind , i got to get back to work .
oh , yeah .
do me a favor .
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
keep an eye on this fowler guy . and his goons .
i &apos;m allowed to do that ?
i &apos;m authorizing you to .
something isn &apos;t right .
hey , my man .
how about you do me a favor ?
what &apos;s that ?
get the latest photo of caffrey to massachusetts p.d.
something you can &apos;t handle yourself ?
oh , i &apos;m just trying to work together .
right .
meet me at our jewelry store in 20 minutes .
i didn &apos;t think i was supposed to
return to the scene of the crime .
let &apos;s revisit it and figure out
how you allegedly pulled this all off .
nice disguise , jacko .
i never really liked this picture .
oh , it &apos;s pretty good for a mug shot .
it &apos;s better than my driver &apos;s license photo .
which one ? you have several .
all right . one crime at a time .
i want to check out that vault .
yeah , well , i can &apos;t exactly walk in .
i &apos;m gonna tell them you &apos;re in my custody
and that you &apos;re gonna show me how you got into the vault .
stealthy .
peter , i &apos;m starting to like you again .
then we &apos;re hanging out too much .
we assumed ...
the thief went through blind spots of the surveillance camera .
but forensics says the alarm was never tampered with .
well , that &apos;s not possible unless ---
he never left the vault .
this wasn &apos;t flickering on the security tape .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
come on .
nothing .
could be a misdirect here .
how did the fbi miss this ?
we didn &apos;t .
fowler had o.p.r. take over the investigation .
i &apos;ll be -- this is an old prohibition tunnel .
yeah , well , someone found a new use for it .
i &apos;ll call in a team .
we &apos;ll start canvassing for witnesses .
we may not have to .
who said big brother &apos;s a bad thing ?
jones .
i &apos;m gonna need you to pull a video off a surveillance camera .
where &apos;s o.p.r. ?
i had jones reassign them to penn station .
jones ? how &apos;d he do that ?
he does a pretty good fowler .
all right , we &apos;re coming up to the place
where our masked man enters the vault .
add a few minutes for him to double back and cover his tracks .
wait wait wait , hold right there .
is that tulane ?
all right , play it at half @-@ speed .
that &apos;s got to be tulane .
come on . come on . turn around .
gotcha .
oh , i guess he never did go to madrid .
i knew his plane tickets were fakes .
no , you didn &apos;t .
guy steals $ 3.2 million in diamonds ,
and we get him because he can &apos;t resist a pretty face .
well , it happens to the best of us .
what ?
you know what .
no , i don &apos;t .
yes , you do .
i see you got my page .
you had no business helping agent burke disappear like that .
why would agent burke disappear ?
you think he was being followed ?
you want to bring on a full o.p.r.investigation , agent jones ?
i can internal review every perp you ever slapped a cuff on .
well , you can start with the one in the conference room .
that &apos;s adrian tulane .
agent burke arrested him this morning
in connection with our jewelry heist .
guess that clears caffrey .
how did you know which vault the diamond would be in ?
silence won &apos;t help you .
but maybe i can .
tell me everything ,
and i can talk to the prosecutor about immunity .
why would you give me immunity ?
well , believe it or not ,
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re the brains behind this operation .
playing on my vanity ?
please , you have some video that proves nothing .
search warrant helped us find this ...
in a townhouse of one of your ... puzzle girls .
i think that proves something .
well , if you &apos;re asking for my expertise ,
i can tell you that a crime like this
often has a ... benefactor .
the entire operation from delivery route to exit strategy
is handed to someone .
tell me something i don &apos;t know .
men with privileged information often hire people
with certain skills to do what they can &apos;t .
of course , all of this is just hypothetical .
this conversation is not hypothetical .
immunity for a name .
oh , is he the prosecutor ?
immunity for a name !
i would if i could .
the more i learn ,
the more i think this whole case is a setup .
a lot of that seems to be going around .
make a little room .
found this stuck on my home phone .
thought you might have dropped it .
i &apos;m not done with this investigation , burke .
neither am i.
i thought that a small celebration would be appropriate .
you really shouldn &apos;t drink champagne out of paper .
you will , and you &apos;ll like it .
it &apos;s twofold , really .
twofold ?
yeah , you &apos;re off the hook .
mm @-@ hmm , and our jobs are a lot easier
when you run with us , not from us .
hear , hear .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
what about o.p.r. ?
they &apos;re gone , for now .
celebrate the victories , however long they last .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
mr.caffrey ? there &apos;s a call for you on line 2 .
oh , &quot; mr. caffrey . &quot; call on line 2 .
it &apos;s probably my lawyer .
you should put him on retainer .
i &apos;ll expense it .
can i use your phone ?
&quot; mr. caffrey . &quot;
mozzie , i told you , just sign the papers for me .
neal , it &apos;s me .
kate .
kate .
he is close to you , neal
look , i know who he is.he &apos;s with the fbi .
yes , then just give him what he wants .
what does he want ?
tell me , kate .
kate . kate
you can &apos;t trust anyone
hey , i &apos;m just going through these fbi files .
there is a terrifying amount of information here .
how many shots from the knoll ?
let &apos;s take a look .
did elvis fake his own death ?
ask the mystery box .
what &apos;s wrong ?
kate called me .
and ?
and i can &apos;t help her .
she won &apos;t tell me where she is .
i have a theory .
conspiracy ?
of course .
look at this .
fowler &apos;s i.d.number.
over here , a local address .
note the dates .
this is from before the diamond heist .
yeah.it &apos;s a hotel room .
it &apos;s not linked to any operation i can find .
now , if i was inclined to believe in such things ,
i &apos;d say it &apos;s worth a look .
room 525 .
