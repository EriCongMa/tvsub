i got my teacher evaluations . look what this student wrote .
&quot; i loved dr. geller &apos;s class . mind @-@ blowing lectures .
you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department . &quot;
&quot; hotties of paleontology . &quot; there &apos;s a big @-@ selling calendar .
who wrote it ?
the evaluations are all anonymous .
you have their exams ?
yeah .
you could just match the handwriting and there &apos;s your admirer .
a hot girl &apos;s at stake and he &apos;s rain man .
wait a minute . why are we so sure that this is a girl ?
it &apos;s a girl !
but it wouldn &apos;t matter.because i &apos;m a teacher . she &apos;s a student .
it &apos;s illegal ?
it &apos;s frowned upon .
and there &apos;s a big age gap .
when you &apos;re 90 ..
i know , she &apos;ll be 80 and it won &apos;t seem like such a big difference .
that &apos;s not what i was gonna say .
when you &apos;re 90,
you &apos;ll still have the memory of being with a 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the one where ross dates a student

i haven &apos;t talked to her in 10 years .
you can &apos;t just call up and ask somebody for a favor .
there are rules , you know ? you gotta put in some time .
right , i &apos;m sorry.it &apos;s not like she &apos;s an ex @-@ girlfriend .
we only went out once .
you dated her ? !
not once .
why don &apos;t i just go out with an ex , you know , and do joey a favor ?
you want to do joey a favor ? maybe you go out with joey .
that &apos;s great . my friend joey &apos;s in the movie business .
you know who i ran into from school ? howie .
my friend &apos;s name is joey .
apparently , howie &apos;s editing now .
yeah , he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie .
can you believe that ? you know , i haven &apos;t spoken to him in 10 years ... and he asks me for a favor ?
yeah , i &apos;ve always hated that howie .
no &quot; how you doing ? &quot; man , i mean , not even a cup of coffee first .
the nerve .
yeah .
refill ?
this is last @-@ minute , so i want to apologize for the mess .
oh , my god !
it sure didn &apos;t look this way when i lived here.i know !
but there &apos;s only room for one , so one of you will have to stay at joey &apos;s .
since the fire was kind of my fault , you should get to stay here .
hey , hey , now . this was no one &apos;s fault . it was an accident .
it was my fault . you should get the nice room.okay !
you &apos;re the first guest at &quot; hotel monica . &quot;
just tell me how you like your eggs.i thought i &apos;d bring them to you in bed .
you &apos;ve been through so much .
i have .
this right here is where i keep the pizza .
and that &apos;s where the napkin is .
what &apos;s that smell ?
i know ! i don &apos;t ...
oh , please , it was such a big class . you never even noticed me .
what ? of course i did . you sat next to &quot; sleepy sleeperson . &quot; who ?
oh . i had trouble remembering names , so i came up with nicknames .
the guy on the other side of you was &quot; smelly von brown shirt . &quot;
oh , yeah .
so did you have a nickname for me ?
no . no .
yes , you did . what was it ?
&quot; cutie mcpretty . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s so sweet !
listen , i gotta tell you , i &apos;m having a great time .
you said it might be weird , the whole student / teacher thing ?
and to be frank , i thought it would be too.but it &apos;s not . i mean , it &apos;s not at all .
dr. geller !
burt !
did you sleep well last night ?
i did.monica was so sweet . she left a little mint on my pillow .
know what joey left on my pillow ?
gum .
we determined the cause of the fire .
i know . it was my candle , my candle !
no , there was an appliance left on . it looks like a curling iron .
i don &apos;t use a curling iron .
someone does .
don &apos;t look at me , my hair &apos;s straight . straight , straight , straight .
it could &apos;ve been a hair straightener . -oh .
this is where i keep the pizza .
and .. hey , where &apos;d the napkin go ?
what is that ? is that old shrimp ?
i think it is !
i wouldn &apos;t want my best guest to strain her eyes .
thanks , monica .
does that smell bother you ?
from joey &apos;s ? i can hardly smell it over here .
well , you let me know if you can . i can bake a pie to cover it .
i can smell it a little , bake a pie .
okay .
hello ? one minute , please .
it &apos;s the fire inspector .
hello ? yeah , this is phoebe .
really ?
yeah , so it turns out that it wasn &apos;t the hair straightener ... that started the fire .
no , no . it was the candles.yeah. it &apos;s very not good leaving candles unattended .
in fact , one of the first things they teach you in fire school is ...
okay , well i have to go now .
we had such a great time . she &apos;s incredible .
i thought the age difference might be a problem , but it wasn &apos;t .
elizabeth is very mature for her age .
a concept lost on some people .
it &apos;s okay to date a student ?
well , not really . technically , it &apos;s not against the rules .
but it &apos;s frowned upon , especially by the professor we saw last night : &quot; judgy von holier @-@ than @-@ thou . &quot;
you don &apos;t want to get a reputation as &quot; professor mcnails @-@ his @-@ students . &quot;
yeah . what should i do ?
well , it seems pretty clear.what &apos;s more important ? what people think or how you feel ?
you gotta follow your heart .
joey , that &apos;s so sweet .
hi .
hey ! so how &apos;d it go with dana ? any reason i should leave a block of time open ? say , thursday ?
i couldn &apos;t do it .
you couldn &apos;t do it ?
i need more time . we &apos;re going to dinner .

going out with who ?
dana keystone , from college .
oh , yeah . wasn &apos;t she ... ?
no , that was dana kaplan .
joey , you didn &apos;t even know her !
yeah , whatever .
great story again.the yarns that you weave !
you know , actually , i should get going .
oh , no , no , stay ! because you should stay .
oh , i am really flattered.but i just ... i don &apos;t feel that way about you .
oh , no , no . that &apos;s not ..
i &apos;m sorry , chandler . you know , you &apos;re such a sweet guy ... and i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
i wish i could do something to make you feel better.no .. really ?
of course .
well , it just hurts so bad , i ...
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
maybe there is one thing you can do .
what ? anything . anything .
well , i mean , this is just off the top of my head now .
but i have this friend .. this actor friend.he would kill me if he knew that i was doing this .
but ... would it be possible for him to audition for your movie on thursday ?
absolutely .
but ... you &apos;d really feel better if your friend could audition for my movie ?
the heart wants what it wants . bye .
hey ! how &apos;s it going ? well , not much has changed in the last five minutes .
yes , it has . i made cookies !

what do you want to do now ? want to get a drink ?
i can &apos;t .
oh , you have some studying to do ?
no , i have some turning 21 to do .
you know , i remember when i was in college , we used to ..
what are you doing ?
nothing , i &apos;m so comfortable with you .
do you not want to be seen with me ?
no , of course i do . are they gone ?
no , they &apos;re still here . but i think i &apos;m about to leave.what ? no , no , wait , wait ..
you &apos;re right , this is stupid . who cares what people think ?
i mean , we like each other , right ? there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .

and so , let &apos;s face it , that &apos;s just kindling .
so i think it &apos;s fair that i stay at joey &apos;s .

okay.chandler , monica &apos;s looking for you .
really ?
she said something about crumbies .
no , no , no ! i was so careful .
you have to switch with me . monica is driving me crazy .
that &apos;s right . all the ladies want to stay at joey &apos;s .
no , i don &apos;t want to switch.please ! i can throw wet paper towels here !
no , but at monica &apos;s , you can eat cookies over the sink .
i know . i &apos;m sorry.all right , fine .
this looks like so much fun . god , what a mess .
wow , it actually is in the handbook .
i can &apos;t date you or have a hot plate in my office .
i can &apos;t believe we have to stop seeing each other .
for what it &apos;s worth , i did appreciate you standing up for me.that felt really nice .
kind of made me like you even more .
i know , i know . i really like you too . but we can &apos;t date .
it &apos;s against the rules . it &apos;s forbidden .
wow . -what ?
just hearing you describe it as &quot; forbidden ... &quot; it &apos;s really hot .
