第七季 第十五集
in 50 feet , you have arrived at your destination .
alicia florrick ?
yes .
i &apos;m sergeant cole mcwain .
may i see your i.d. , please ?
yes .
thank you .
would you mind getting in the backseat , please ?
my cell phone &apos;s ringing . may i answer it ?
yes , you may .
hello , eli . i can &apos;t talk right now .
the fbi are investigating .
i know .
they &apos;re going after peter .
wait , how do you know ?
ruth came by my office .
look , i @-@ i need to go .
wait . we &apos;re hiring a lawyer .
sounds like the smart thing to do .
bye .
we need your help .
we think they &apos;re coming after peter again .
this is doctor &apos;s orders . i am cursed
with high blood pressure .
just give me the bullet points .
the fbi is asking questions .
professional or personal ?
both .
about peter &apos;s conduct
in office or running for office ?
both .
that sounds serious .
or is it a smokescreen ?
or both .
so ...
you need a lawyer to figure out why you need a lawyer ?
yes .
the only thing i know for sure , this ...
fbi agent , devereaux , he &apos;s out for blood .
like gladiator , huh ?
yes , like gladiator .
well , then let &apos;s go .
there &apos;s no time to waste .
okay . good . just a few more . diane ,
can you look at cory ?
cary .
yes , sorry . cary .
uh , you , sir , not so much teeth .
is this the right amount of teeth ?
yes .
great . everybody say aba ?
aba .
good . now just the women .
aba .
no , i mean the men can step out , take five .
thank you , men .
what &apos;s the spin of this aba article anyhow ?
i have no idea .
my guess is : third largest firm in chicago .
it &apos;s not about women in the firm ?
no . why ?
they sure are spending a lot of time with the women .
okay , let &apos;s not go there .
all publicity for the firm is good publicity .
no , actually , that &apos;s not true .
okay , good .
so that &apos;s it ?
why are we waiting around here like schmucks ?
david , he &apos;s probably just moving into another room .
let &apos;s calm down .
are we moving into another room ?
no . we &apos;re done .
thanks .
uh , he &apos;s coming back tomorrow .
yeah , but just to shoot the women .
thanks , guys . good shoot .
great . we &apos;ll just go back to the cleaning and cooking .
so , this aba article ,
what &apos;s it about ?
well , what do you mean ?
the firm , i think .
women at the firm ?
no . just the firm .
this shoot tomorrow ,
he just wants a photo of us with alicia .
that &apos;s all .
she &apos;s not an equity partner .
i know . i think it &apos;s about name value .
but he just wants the female partners with her ?
cary , it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s just an angle he &apos;s pushing .
i don &apos;t think anything will come of it . okay ?
did you need something ?
yeah . is alicia out today ?
she had that personal thing .
oh , right . well , when she calls in ,
could you forward her to me ?
yeah .
what are you doing for lunch today ?
eating .
would you like to eat together ? 12 : 30 ?
sure .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ll need to leave your phone and personal effects .
you &apos;ll be able to check your messages on breaks .
please follow me .
mrs. florrick , there you are . welcome .
please .
we were just getting started . so you &apos;re right on time .
mrs. florrick , hello .
captain hicks .
i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be here .
i see you two know each other . good .
at the expense of sounding like summer camp ,
i wouldn &apos;t mind if
we went quickly around the table-- martin .
martin barnstone . intelligence legal advisor .
and other things .
martin is our ollie north .
《 纽约时报 》 畅销作者 前海军陆战队中校
george kirby . legal advisor . state department .
george makes sure we follow the rules .
captain terrence hicks . army general &apos;s corps attorney .
and now our two civilian advisors .
both come highly recommended and vetted .
alicia florrick , wife to the governor .
she has worked as civilian counsel in military court
and comes at the recommendation
of colonel leora kuhn . and ed .
edward janoway .
corporate lawyer with palmer / janoway .
i think i &apos;m the fire @-@ breathing conservative
to mrs. florrick &apos;s bleeding heart .
and i &apos;m oren cleary , legal counsel
to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
it &apos;s a mouthful , i know .
this is a confidential session .
all of the items and materials discussed here
are subject , under penalty of law , to confidentiality rules .
you may take notes during this session , but those notes
must be relinquished before we &apos;ve finished .
and no items or evidence may be taken
from this room . understood ? good .
martin .
as i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware , the executive branch
has taken flack lately for its legal justification
regarding executive order 12333 .
the president has asked for a broader consensus
on action item 56 @-@ 984b .
our two civilian consultants have been granted
ts / sci clearance to take part .
please break the seal on your briefing materials now .
on the inside , you will find a photo of massoud tahan .
he is an isis recruiter in syria .
mrs. florrick , do you need help ?
no , i &apos;m good .
in the past two years ,
eight americans , ten brits , and two dozen belgians
have joined isis due to tahan &apos;s efforts .
they credit his recruitment on social media .
mr. tahan limits his appeals
to the religious importance of isis establishing a caliphate .
he hasn &apos;t specifically promoted violence .
however , his recruits have been behind
some of the worst atrocities we &apos;ve seen in iraq and syria .
beheadings , bombings , rape .
and what do you need from us ?
we know tahan &apos;s location for the next 48 hours .
you have been selected to give the administration
legal justification to kill him .
jason crouse . hello .
hey .
good to have you working here .
a new on @-@ site investigator .
how exciting . i just wanted
to introduce myself-- david lee , family law .
nice to meet you .
so , hey , there is something i need right away .
you kind of got a cowboy thing going , don &apos;t you ?
not intentionally .
well , i need work that i &apos;ll pay for out of my pocket .
given that you &apos;re freelance ,
that shouldn &apos;t be a problem , should it ?
what work ?
diane lockhart is one of the name partners .
you &apos;ve heard of her ?
i have .
i &apos;m worried she intends to make
lockhart , agos &amp; lee a fully female @-@ run firm .
so i need to know the conversations she &apos;s having
with alicia and the other female partners .
okay .
that &apos;s it ? no questions ?
no .
any for me ?
no .
so , the people this agent devereaux has approached are
judge schakowsky , ruth eastman ,
and mr. gold &apos;s daughter .
so far , yes .
what &apos;s huh ?
you and the governor are both wearing maroon ties .
is that important ?
maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery .
so , governor , why do you think the fbi is interested in you ?
i have no idea .
there must be something that you &apos;ve walked
right up to the line on .
believe me , if i had any idea
what this was about , i &apos;d tell you .
elsbeth , could you give us a minute ?
i &apos;ll be right outside .
i mean , not outside @-@ outside . just out ... there .
you need to tell her everything .
i am .
you &apos;re not .
eli , we &apos;ve been together a long time .
anything that i &apos;ve done , you &apos;ve done .
no .
i did not try to fix an election for alicia .
an fbi investigation is a game @-@ changer , peter .
all cards need to be on the table .
in a minute , elsbeth !
not now , nora .
the fbi just called .
tell &apos; em i &apos;ll call back .
it wasn &apos;t for you .
it was for me .
the threshold question is this :
does an isis recruiter rise to the level of enemy combatant ?
is that the only way this guy makes it onto the kill list ?
yes , if we want to avoid blowback--
not just political but legal .
has he ever fired a gun or killed anyone ?
no , not to our knowledge .
but his recruits have .
his recruits have killed hundreds .
tahan &apos;s posted dozens of online calls to join isis :
sleuthway , youtube , telegram .
but has he ever espoused violence ?
no .
well , the fact that he doesn &apos;t
overtly espouse violence just shows
how sophisticated isis has become .
but how do you judge that ?
he talks about establishing the caliphate ,
which makes him more of a preacher
than anything else .
isis isn &apos;t a religion .
it &apos;s a terrorist group with one goal , which is
to convert or kill anyone who doesn &apos;t believe what they do .
yes , but tahan isn &apos;t actually doing these things .
it &apos;s his recruits .
why are you protecting him , captain ?
i &apos;m not protecting anyone .
i &apos;m thinking of the message it sends to other nations
if we call a recruiter an enemy combatant .
once we do that , what &apos;s next ?
targeting imams , college professors ?
when they advocate violent attacks on americans , yes .
then what &apos;s the pushback on putin when he says
he can take out a ukrainian youtube star
who he claims is an agitator ?
if the youtube star is telling people to go to paris
and shoot up concert halls , i say , go , putin .
the united states has always held
that a propagandist is not a combatant
and is therefore immune from targeted killing .
no . look at junaid hussain .
he was a propagandist , and we killed him .
so we ...
go ahead , mrs. florrick . please .
so we &apos;re supposed to wait until tahan plans
a successful attack before we stop him ?
i take it you don &apos;t think we should .
i ... i think we need to do everything we can , legally ,
to stop isis .
i agree with mrs. florrick .
has tahan purposefully and materially supported hostilities
against the u.s. ? that is our only question .
what material has he provided ?
bodies-- you asked how he materially supported the enemy .
he &apos;s supplied the bodies for the bombs .
okay . i think we should vote .
is massoud tahan an enemy combatant
and can he be placed on a targeted kill list ?
to my right , please .
aye .
aye .
nay .
aye .
aye .
it carries . massoud tahan is an enemy combatant
and can be placed on a targeted kill list .
we will write up the legal justification . but first ,
there is one other matter .
sorry i can &apos;t agree .
you don &apos;t have to apologize . we all have our opinions .
pass these around , please .
you may break the seals .
this is lance hopper .
he was born and raised in chicago .
went to chicago polytech , where he studied comparative religions .
he disappeared about two years ago .
he resurfaced in syria
and called himself massoud tahan .
so the man you want to kill is an american ?
that &apos;s correct .
so let &apos;s talk .
you may wonder why we did it this way ,
waited to tell you that mr. tahan was an american citizen .
there are two threshold questions ,
and we wanted to answer one before we answered the other .
everything we said about tahan was true .
we were merely trying to eliminate bias and emotion .
what &apos;s wrong with emotion ?
it clouds judgment .
sometimes it clarifies it .
if massoud tahan is an enemy combatant ,
then so is lance hopper .
but an american has first amendment rights .
hopper can say and believe whatever he wants .
he &apos;s not in trouble for talking .
he &apos;s in trouble for being an enemy combatant .
yes ,
but we only concluded he was an enemy combatant because of what he said .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s accurate .
just as mrs. florrick put so eloquently ,
he supplied materials in the form of bodies to carry bombs .
still , if he &apos;s an american , he gets due process .
are you withdrawing your support for the targeted strike ?
no . but i want to know more .
there &apos;s nothing more to know if you still support the targeted strike .
withdraw your support for the air strike ,
and we &apos;ll be told more .
i withdraw my support .
temporarily .
okay . let &apos;s get started .
why did you tell the fbi anything ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s fine , nora .
just tell us what you told him .
he wanted to know
who calls here for eli and who eli calls .
what &apos;d you tell him ?
i said a million calls
go through this office every day ,
and i don &apos;t write down names .
i didn &apos;t say you tell me not to write down names .
did he ask about anyone specific ?
nora , you can speak freely . go .
he asked if judge schakowsky ever comes by .
that &apos;s when i got a bad feeling .
you &apos;re kidding . nora knows .
nora knows what ?
well , there is one potential ... issue .
there always is .
what &apos;s yours ?
vote rigging .
okay .
let &apos;s crack open the green notebook .
that &apos;s for serious notes .
would you like to sit down ?
no , i &apos;m good .
it would make me more comfortable .
so , um , are you working on the van derwerff divorce ?
no .
well , the reason i ask is
i saw david lee meeting with you this morning .
i thought it was about the van derwerff divorce .
it wasn &apos;t .
so he was just introducing himself ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
are you doing freelance work for david lee ?
if i was doing freelance work for david ,
i wouldn &apos;t be able to tell you .
same as if i were doing freelance work for you .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to tell him .
so he &apos;s asking you to do freelance work ?
i better get back to work .
did he ask you to investigate me ?
i better get back to work .
david lee loves to create paranoia and dissension .
don &apos;t help him .
good to know .
so how are you liking it here ?
fine .
really ?
fine never sounds very fine .
no , it &apos;s fine .
and how &apos;s alicia handling it ?
fine .
has diane approached alicia
about her position at the firm ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you mean ?
last year , there was an attempt to make this a female @-@ run firm ,
and i just wanted to know if there &apos;s been a new attempt .
well , that &apos;s a question for alicia .
but alicia &apos;s mia today .
and you &apos;re alicia &apos;s friend , so i &apos;m asking you .
i &apos;ll tell her you want to talk .
where you headed ?
out for some air . you ?
no idea .
this place is insane .
alicia , it &apos;s cary .
i know you &apos;re out today , but i need you to call .
hey . so this is a weird firm .
i need some advice .
alicia . diane .
we need to talk .
yeah , so ... i &apos;ll talk to you .
i think you might want to come inside .
we &apos;re reviewing lance hopper &apos;s statements .
... longed for the caliphate to be restored .
well , we now have it .
so the righteous and the rightly guided must ...
three conditions must be met
for the targeted killing of a u.s. citizen .
please refer to your binders .
first , the individual poses an imminent threat
f violent attack against the united states .
two , the capture of the individual is not feasible .
and three : the operation
is conducted consistent with applicable law of war principles .
the job of this panel is to decide if the three conditions are met .
we are lance hopper &apos;s due process .
okay . let &apos;s talk about imminent .
all of these are past atrocities .
even if i concede that tahan--
or , make that , hopper-- is somehow responsible ,
they &apos;ve already happened .
an imminent threat is necessarily a future one .
are we aware of any future threats ?
yes . he posted that video two days ago .
but that wasn &apos;t a threat .
yes , but you said so
yourself , ma &apos;am . re we supposed to wait
until he plans another successful attack ? ?
but the threshold has changed .
now it &apos;s about imminence .
imminent means seconds , minutes , hours .
no . this administration defines
imminent as anything under 60 days .
seriously ?
technically , since the enemy
is so good at hiding their attacks ,
any future attack is now considered imminent .
according to whom ?
the department of justice .
that &apos;s nothing more than legal wordplay .
no , it &apos;s trying to account for the realities of war .
having spent my career in the army ,
i understand the realities very clearly .
the country i serve doesn &apos;t try
to weasel out of what it always stood for ,
just because it happens to be convenient .
imminent should mean imminent .
maybe we should vote again .
actually , we &apos;ve got 30 hours to make the decision .
let &apos;s take the night ,
and come back in the morning and vote .
why are we taking the night ?
because we can .
okay . hm .
sorry .
sorry .
just wanted to make sure you were settling in okay .
uh , yup , all ... good .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , i &apos;m a visual processor .
and slightly kinesthetic @-@ tactile .
what ?
what did ruth eastman do for the campaign ?
uh , she was the campaign manager .
strategy , donors , coalitions .
are you thinking vote rigging ?
could be .
schakowsky knew , nora knew .
did ruth know ?
no , she joined the campaign long after that .
unless peter told her .
campaign managers push their candidates to
admit all before signing on .
so , ruth ... might ... have ... known .
aha . so , the question is ,
did she ?
who is that ? i can &apos;t even read that .
oh , your daughter . marissa .
why her ?
i have no idea .
then let &apos;s talk to her .
oh , come on .
so , you &apos;re working late .
no later than you .
just seeing what piled up on my desk .
want something to drink ?
no , i &apos;m all right .
could you , um ... ?
yeah .
so , people really don &apos;t trust each other around here , do they ?
not much .
let me ask you something .
is diane trying to make this into an all @-@ female firm ?
no idea .
who &apos;s worried ? cary ?
look at that . very manly .
you sure ?
i &apos;m good .
so , diane &apos;s never said anything about it ?
an all @-@ female firm ?
uh , maybe a year or so ago ,
but a lot &apos;s happened .
do you think i drink too much ?
i don &apos;t know . do you ?
i was gonna break this bottle
if i couldn &apos;t get the cork out .
that might be a problem .
then here .
wait . no .
no , no , seriously , you don &apos;t need it .
let &apos;s just ... let &apos;s just talk .
jason , come on .
you don &apos;t need it , seriously .
okay , yes , but i want it .
hey , wait ... just ... try something for a minute .
close your eyes . just close &apos; em .
take a deep breath .
slow it down .
if this doesn &apos;t work , do i get the glass ?
just ... listen to yourself breathe .
i don &apos;t meditate , jason .
okay , then we won &apos;t call this meditation .
just ... listen .
to what ?
my breathing .
that &apos;s security .
they turn the lights off after 11 : 00 .
anything else ?
so why did you know about the vote rigging ?
because you were mrs. florrick &apos;s body woman ?
yes .
keeper of confidences , you know ?
pourer of comfort cereal .
what kind of cereal ?
i don &apos;t know . life .
wheat chex . why ?
i like wheat chex .
did agent devereaux ask about anything else ?
uh , no .
i guess he asked about my dad &apos;s rich friends ,
and then he asked about working for alicia .
and that was it ?
yeah .
well , he asked about my time in israel ,
and the idf and the dairy farm i worked on .
and i talked about my purse business .
you sell purses ?
no , i make them .
i didn &apos;t really end up selling any .
oh . what did they look like ?
the purses ?
really cool .
kind of macram with leather straps
and things sewn into them .
wow . what things ?
things i found ,
like kewpie dolls and bullet shells .
what ?
i have to go .
where ?
um ... away .
i can &apos;t be peter &apos;s lawyer .
wait . what ? why ?
uh , well , i can &apos;t really say .
you can &apos;t ?
elsbeth , wait . what ? !
bye .
here &apos;s my card .
write me about your purses .
i want to buy one .
so , you don &apos;t want to hire me for anything ,
but that &apos;s your lawyer ?
alicia florrick ...
here you go .
thank you .
would you mind getting in the ... ?
no problem .
good . mrs. florrick .
i think we &apos;re ready .
good . i am , too .
great .
let &apos;s take our seats , and we can pick up where we left off .
the question is : is lance hopper an imminent threat
to the united states ?
now , if everyone is prepared to vote , we can move ...
um , i &apos;m sorry , but captain hicks--
where is he ?
the captain has been excused from these proceedings .
he ... ? what does that mean ?
that means he will not be continuing with us .
now we should really move on .
why ?
well , the reasons are confidential , mrs. florrick .
we really need to move on .
no . i &apos;m sorry , but i would like to know
why captain hicks isn &apos;t here ,
and i don &apos;t think i &apos;m the only one .
actually , i think you are .
no . i want to know , too .
everyone here is subject to confidentiality rules ,
and the captain is currently being questioned
about certain ... leaks .
you &apos;re saying he leaked ?
no , it &apos;s not my position to say he leaked .
i &apos;m merely saying he &apos;s being questioned about certain leaks .
now we need to vote . in 12 hours ,
hopper is going to be moved .
does he pose an imminent threat of violence against
the united states ?
yes . he does .
are there any no &apos;s ?
so it &apos;s a tie .
which i will break with a yes ?
so condition one is met . we &apos;ll move on to condition two .
is capture at all feasible ?
why can &apos;t you be peter &apos;s attorney ?
i can &apos;t say .
does it have something to do with the vote rigging ?
rock once for yes , twice for no .
namaste .
elsbeth ... give me something .
fine . but then you really have to go .
what is this ?
it &apos;s not a what . it &apos;s a he .
michael tascioni ?
my ex .
nice to meet you .
it &apos;s good to have you on board .
i &apos;m sorry that i had to bring tom ,
but , uh , el insists he gets separation anxiety ,
and , well , since we share custody ...
uh , your ex @-@ wife came back for her notes .
i @-@ i tried to look at them before , but ...
they made no sense ?
no . scribbles , stickers .
she used to do the same thing to pick our vacation spots .
piles of index cards .
and on top , hello . my name is sedona .
hello . my name is peru .
drove me nuts .
so we &apos;re starting from scratch .
not entirely .
i can tell you that , uh ,
the fbi is not investigating the governor for vote rigging .
they &apos;re not ?
how can you be so sure ?
because you went into this assuming
that was about vote rigging .
that was the pattern el was trying to trace with her cards .
so if she was conflicted out about that ,
then she would &apos;ve known it from the beginning ?
exactly .
what was being said when she realized she was conflicted out ?
well , she was questioning my daughter ,
and they were talking about the idf ,
working on an israeli dairy farm , uh ...
and purses she was making .
yeah , el loves purses .
mm . then agent devereaux-- the fbi agent--
uh , the questions he had about alicia ,
working with her ...
uh , my rich friends .
your rich friends , who are they-- donors ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s your conflict . she has a client .
a client that could lead back to me ?
yes .
we need elsbeth &apos;s client list .
how do we get that ?
do you have any water ?
yes , yes .
yeah .
thank you .
so how do we figure out
who the conflict of interest is ?
we find elsbeth &apos;s client list .
how do we get that ?
i &apos;d like to request the case file for my divorce .
name , i.d. ,
date action became final .
michael b. tascioni . july 28 , 2012 .
we don &apos;t allow dogs in this office .
would you mind taking him outside ?
tom is a service animal .
he &apos;s an emotional support chihuahua .
hold on a minute .
so , what does a case file from your divorce do ?
our property settlement agreement is still pending .
it values my law practice and elsbeth &apos;s
and contains a list of all our clients .
ah , smart .
are you a cat person ?
no . i &apos;m a person person .
why ?
read here , or i can reprint for ten cents a page .
can you please ...
i &apos;ll look at it .
i &apos;ll recognize anyone connected to peter .
it &apos;s in the appendix . first page .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
what is it ?
how can one client be redacted ?
oh , i got an order from a judge .
the judicial system takes the secrecy
of a grand jury witness seriously .
you should , too .
tommy .
i waited around just to see you .
you knew i was coming ?
i know you , dear .
and i know you .
i &apos;m coming for you .
tell me when .
i don &apos;t want to miss it .
isn &apos;t she something ?
yes .
fantastic .
what now ?
now ...
we get smart .
i want you to talk with her .
and say what ?
i want you to say something that will make her paranoid .
what &apos;s that ?
what else ?
nothing else .
diane lockhart &apos;s not maneuvering to make this an all @-@ female firm .
and alicia ?
a year ago , diane suggested to alicia that
this could be an all @-@ female partnership .
but they didn &apos;t pursue it .
as far as you know .
yeah , as far as i know .
did diane question you about our concerns ?
yes .
she did ?
yes . she saw me leaving your office yesterday .
what did you say ?
i said my freelance work for you was confidential .
okay , so she had a deal with alicia a year ago
to make this an all @-@ female firm--
why isn &apos;t she still coming after us ?
you asked me to look for evidence if she was .
i did .
there is none .
yeah , but she knew you were investigating ,
so maybe she prevented you from finding that evidence .
i can &apos;t answer that .
why not ?
because i deal in evidence .
i don &apos;t deal in states of mind .
you think we &apos;re being paranoid ?
i haven &apos;t been here long enough to answer that conclusively .
okay . thanks .
hey , this is jason . leave a message .
mrs. florrick .
we should talk .
sure .
may i just say this ?
i know captain hicks .
he &apos;s one of the most honest men i know .
he wouldn &apos;t leak .
yet there was a leak .
where ? &apos; cause i &apos;ve been searching the web
and there &apos;s no reference to what we &apos;re doing here .
this was an internal leak at the state department .
what does that mean ?
it means there was an interdepartmental squabble
and somebody leaked what we &apos;re doing here to another department .
well , that wasn &apos;t captain hicks ; he wouldn &apos;t do that .
yeah .
that &apos;s why we need to talk to you .
to me-- are you kidding ?
no .
you think i leaked ?
well , i know that you and captain hicks
have been against this project as soon as you found out
that massoud tahan was an american citizen .
so you want to get rid of both of us .
uh @-@ oh . alicia &apos;s in trouble .
why ? what &apos;d she do ?
they think she &apos;s the leak .
she &apos;s working for the pentagon ?
alicia florrick ?
yes , on an ad @-@ hoc basis .
as a civilian consultant .
shut up , j.
no , he &apos;s right .
so she &apos;s vetted ?
by the pentagon , but not us .
they didn &apos;t find out about our three @-@ hop warrant .
right .
and we were following her for a different reason .
you know , because of the ... you know ...
she was representing dellinger .
you know , the worker who fled to iceland .
so we overheard some confidential information from the pentagon ,
she was on her phone leaking to ...
uh , no .
she was just talking near her phone .
not on her phone .
she wasn &apos;t on her phone ?
right . we used dropoutjeep to turn her phone into a hot mic .
we can broadcast anything within 20 feet .
so what are you saying ?
she wasn &apos;t the leak .
so who was ?
we don &apos;t know .
maybe nobody .
shut up , j.
he may be right .
there &apos;s a chance this could be in @-@ house .
we were listening in . the two of us .
not to the confidential session , but outside .
what was that ?
sorry .
alicia &apos;s having sex with the investigator .
ah , great .
here we go .
i think you might want to come inside .
we &apos;re reviewing lance hopper &apos;s statements .
so that was sent around internally here ?
mm @-@ hmm . yeah .
and we think that was the leak . not alicia .
so who &apos;s in the loop around here ?
everybody at cmi level .
all right . all right , i &apos;ll see what i can do .
but hold off on listening further .
what do you mean ? why ?
because i asked you to .
yeah , but we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
who said you did something wrong ?
just hold off until i get back to you .
you guys screwed up .
shut up , j.
shut up , j.
is there a problem ?
an enormous one .
the fbi is circling the governor .
you can &apos;t tell us why .
even though you know .
so we &apos;re stuck chasing ghosts .
i need you to take tom
until i can get my arms around this thing .
of course .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t be more help ,
but i have a client to protect here , too .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
tell your client their phone &apos;s probably being tapped .
meaning ?
we just heard
the fbi tapped peter &apos;s phones .
if they &apos;re listening to the governor ,
they &apos;re listening to everyone .
you &apos;re trying to make me paranoid .
no .
not you . him .
now that you &apos;ve told me , i have to warn my client .
it &apos;s my fiduciary responsibility as his lawyer .
even if it &apos;s a lie , i can &apos;t risk putting him in jeopardy .
but i can &apos;t call my client ,
so i have to go to my client .
but if i go to my client ,
you &apos;ll follow me .
or you &apos;ll stake out this office .
we &apos;re just trying to help .
so that &apos;s a good move .
now how do i move around it ?
or do i ?
god , you &apos;re good at this .
or do i avoid your tail ?
that should be easy .
okay , i &apos;m heading out .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll join you .
yeah ?
so the dog has a gps collar ?
indeed .
i bought it a week ago .
it &apos;s all part of the master plan .
is the dot not moving part of the master plan ?
hm . the pergola . garfield park .
i love that spot .
that &apos;s where i proposed .
elsbeth &apos;s sending a message ,
leaving his collar there .
guess it probably wasn &apos;t that hard ,
on a dog his size .
it was a very big collar .
so wait , if the op is blown ,
why do you two look so smug ?
a : one should always looks smug .
and b :
it &apos;s exactly what we wanted elsbeth to do .
she thinks she &apos;s shaken her tail .
now she &apos;s let her guard down
and she won &apos;t notice her real tail .
you got her ?
i got her .
i followed elsbeth from garfield park
to a cafe on randolph .
she hates that diner .
they have paella .
she had a bad experience with paella .
ten minutes later ,
this guy comes in and sits down with her .
wait , wait that one .
yeah .
his name is lloyd garber .
i followed him to his office on michigan .
turns out he owns the whole building .
he owns a lot more than that .
you know him ?
yeah , he &apos;s ...
dairy .
dairy .
that &apos;s how she figured it out .
garber owns a dairy farm in israel .
he &apos;s the one who got me my job .
elsbeth just connected the dots .
and that &apos;s the name she redacted from her client list ?
yeah , so that &apos;s not good .
they &apos;re coming after peter
and one of his donors .
yup .
now it &apos;s time to go on the attack .
the pentagon confirmed today that a u.s. drone strike
killed massoud tahan , an isis operative
linked to the terror attack at a cartoon drawing contest
in garland , texas .
you &apos;re back from your secret mission .
yup .
i heard things here are getting a bit crazy .
i thought bond court was a jungle , but wow .
best thing to do-- stay on the sidelines .
we could just leave .
we could .
but money .
money .
do you know where jason is ?
why ?
just curious .
the three of us against the world .
hey . you &apos;re back .
yup .
they didn &apos;t need me anymore .
and she can &apos;t tell us who they are .
mm @-@ hmm . it &apos;s top secret .
so , it &apos;s been fun here , huh ?
yeah , a gender war .
jason , do you have a minute ?
i do .
i &apos;ll leave you two .
nice to have you back .
good to be back .
you want me to close the door ?
yeah . glass walls .
we have to get used to them .
so ...
things are complicated between us now .
what do you mean ?
i remember high school .
i remember my phone calls being ignored .
i am not ignoring anything .
i just ...
i don &apos;t like not knowing what the situation is .
what situation ?
look , it &apos;s not like you &apos;re married to the corner grocer .
all right ? it &apos;s the governor .
and that &apos;s my problem .
no . my problem too .
he accepts it .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
he may say it , but no one accepts it .
okay .
i accept it .
and ...
you kept me from drinking .
if you don &apos;t come to me tonight , who knows ?
maybe i &apos;ll start drinking again .
way to make me feel guilty .
you want things simple , i want things simple , too .
so here it is :
i want you again .
don &apos;t you want it ?
i want it .
would you like me to tell you exactly ...
mr. hopkins .
i need you to come with us .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
we just need to ask you a few questions , that &apos;s all .
i was permitted to use the hot mic .
i know . please come with us .
i didn &apos;t leak anything .
good , then there shouldn &apos;t be any problem here .
i just sent the recording to the system admin . stephen ...
hey , i &apos;m just working here .
i need this job .
i got tagged for the hot mic .
it doesn &apos;t mean i leaked .
good .
then there shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
