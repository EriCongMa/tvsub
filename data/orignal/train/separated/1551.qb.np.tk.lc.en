we &apos;ve just received a report
that the victim has been identified
by the san francisco locals as natalie gibecki ,
although police are keeping the nature of her death
under wraps for the moment .
her name &apos;s natalie gibecki . 27 years old .
works as a counselor
in a youth probation facility a few blocks over .
the mayor serves on the board , so we got the call .
petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes
and the marks around the neck indicate that she was strangled .
where &apos;s lisbon ?
she &apos;s with s.f.p.d.
they talked to the victim &apos;s boss .
apparently , she was on her way
to see a movie with friends .
not likely .
come again ?
well , she &apos;s wearing a black lace camisole .
she was planning on changing her flats to heels .
her makeup is freshly applied .
she &apos;s wearing a very ... very flowery perfume--
j &apos;adore , if i &apos;m not mistaken .
she was going to meet a lover .
married , i &apos;d guess , based on the deception .
excuse me .
hello ?
hello , patrick . it &apos;s erica flynn .
erica flynn . wow , this is a surprise .
pleasant , i hope .
i bet you &apos;re wondering why i &apos;m calling .
yeah . thought crossed my mind .
what if i said i wanted to hear your voice ?
i &apos;d say you were lying .
not entirely .
natalie gibecki-- i knew her personally .
she was a client of my matchmaking company .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
thank you .
we grew very close during our sessions together ,
but then you know how that can happen .
what do you want , erica ?
yes , i haven &apos;t said , have i ?
no .
i &apos;m calling because i can help you find her killer .
really ? what &apos;s his name ?
if you want the answer , you know where to find me .
it was nice to hear your voice again , patrick .
yours , too .
thank you , dennis .
of course , ms. flynn .
you &apos;re helpful as always .
who was that ?
uh , that was erica flynn .
she wants to help out with the investigation .
great . we should fax over the case file
and get her a gun .
well , getting her a gun &apos;s a bit much ,
but , uh , i think the case file may help .
i was kidding .
yeah .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
please tell me you &apos;re kidding .

hello , patrick .
erica . you look good .
orange suits you .
well , i suppose i have you to thank for my wardrobe .
i didn &apos;t kill your husband .
neither did i. manslaughter . big difference .
what is this about ?
i know who killed natalie gibecki .
how is that possible ?
we grew close during our sessions together .
natalie told me things that she didn &apos;t tell anyone else ,
like the fact that she was seeing someone in secret .
why would she need a dating service
if she was already seeing someone ?
she met him during our sessions together .
that must have been some time ago .
ten months ,
but natalie was still seeing him when she died .
i &apos;m sure of it .
how ?
i know true love when i see it .
then why the secrecy ?
the man natalie was seeing was married .
she kept the affair from everyone .
everyone except you .
yes .
why are you doing this ?
i cared deeply about natalie .
her death is a tragedy ,
and her killer should be punished .
that was a nice try .
all right . i want out of here .
temporarily , of course .
you have no idea what this is like , patrick ,
living in a cage ,
knowing i &apos;ll be here for years .
the truth is , this may be my last chance at freedom
while i &apos;m young enough to enjoy it .
i just want to go to the spa ,
eat at my favorite restaurant ,
a few harmless indulgences
in return for helping you catch a killer .
what if you &apos;re lying ?
you once said you could see right through me .
&quot; transparent as glass , &quot; i believe , was how you put it ,
so tell me , am i lying now ?
natalie gibecki left the youth facility at 8 : 14 p.m.
a commuter found her body at 8 : 33,
giving us a 19 @-@ minute window
for the murder to have been committed .
and what do we have for motive ?
well , there &apos;s nothing missing from natalie &apos;s body ,
so robbery seems out .
no sign of sexual assault , either .
natalie had just returned
from a 5 @-@ day trip to puerto vallarta .
i &apos;m checking it out .
what about jane &apos;s theory about a boyfriend ?
we looked into it .
friends all say natalie wasn &apos;t seeing anyone .
family ?
only child . parents died years ago .
all right . head to the youth facility
and talk to the other counselors
that were working on natalie &apos;s shifts .
see if they know anything .
uh , boss , any way i can skip this and work the phones ?
i have an appointment in an hour i can &apos;t miss .
are you all right ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s just , uh , something i have to do .
sure . van pelt ?
sure . on it .
we &apos;re from cbi .
we &apos;re here investigating natalie gibecki &apos;s murder .
i don &apos;t know how we &apos;re gonna tell the boys .
they all loved natalie .
do you guys have any idea who did this ?
we &apos;re still in the early stages of the investigation .
we have reason to believe that natalie may have been
romantically involved with someone .
either of you know anything about that ?
no .
yeah , no . i thought she was single .
hey , kevin !
keep that up .
you &apos;ll be doing push @-@ ups until you puke .
the relationship could have been with a co @-@ worker .
well , don &apos;t look at me .
you didn &apos;t like her ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that . she--
she just wasn &apos;t my type .
kevin ! what did i just say ?
now drop and give me 50 . now !
can you think of anyone who may have wanted to harm natalie ?
no , but ... we did have a kid go missing
from the facility last night .
hey , trent didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
his name was trent ?
trent matthews . he &apos;s 17 .
was in here for drug possession and assault .
what time did he go missing ?
i saw him at dinner , so sometime after 7 : 00 .
yeah , but like i said , he didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
we &apos;re gonna need to see his file .
keep going .
you want to let her out of prison ?
well , no , i just think erica could help us .
she knows details of the victim &apos;s life .
she may even know the killer .
she says she does .
that she &apos;s telling the truth about .
even so , it doesn &apos;t mean we need her help .
no , i didn &apos;t say that . i said she could be useful .
what do you think , luther ?
i &apos;m intrigued .
sir .
i think ...
it &apos;s just the kind of innovative thinking
the cbi needs more of .
using a convict to catch a killer--
it &apos;s synergy .
exactly .
sir , this isn &apos;t even our jurisdiction .
we couldn &apos;t get her released if we tried .
you &apos;re right ,
but the warden at golden valley state prison
has already approved it .
ms. flynn &apos;s guaranteed a furlough through
the rehabilitation program that the governor instituted .
apparently , she &apos;s a model inmate .
she &apos;s a convicted murderer .
convicted manslaughterer , actually .
oh , well , in that case ...
so you agree ?
no . she &apos;s a dangerous killer ,
and she &apos;s a flight risk .
well , which is exactly why i &apos;ll be assigning two agents
to guard her at all times .
see , lisbon ? what could possibly go wrong ?
excuse me .
synergy .
hey , cho .
what &apos;s up ?
you called me .
oh , yeah , yeah . that &apos;s right .
i got some background on trent matthews .
he was attending sequoia valley high school
before he was busted for possession and assault .
it &apos;s not that far from the youth facility .
you think he might head back there ?
well , he &apos;s alone .
family moved away from the area .
he &apos;s probably just looking for some cash and a place to stay .
might try old friends for help .
all right . van pelt and i will get on it .
wayne , you ready ? class is about to start .
oh , yeah , yeah . all set .
welcome , mommies and daddies .
my name is atoosa ,
and i will be leading your class today .
welcome to the first step
on your amazing journey of parenthood .
now before we begin , i would like each of you
to go around the room and offer something about yourselves .
would you like to start ?
sure . um , hi . my name is sarah .
welcome , sarah .
oh , hi . i &apos;m wayne .
welcome , wayne .
um ... okay , i &apos;m 28 weeks .
uh , this is my first child .
wait . our first child ?
oh , yeah . definitely our first .
okay . our first child .
well , although &quot; our &quot; might be a little misleading .
no , not that this isn &apos;t his baby .
i am not some kind of floozy or anything ,
and , gosh , not that anyone in this room is , uh , you know--
no , i--that is-- i just meant , um--
she just meant that we &apos;re not married .
that--that was it , that we &apos;re not married .
no . i mean , yes .
according to the youth facility ,
trent matthews was busted for possession
at this high school three months ago .
you know , kids used to call me &quot; bracey gracie &quot;
because i wore braces until i was 17 .
what did people call you ?
cho .
that &apos;s him .
fight ! fight ! fight ! fight ! fight !
hey , break it up !
come on ! get off me , man !
hey , get off , man .
trent matthews ?
what ?
cbi . we need a word .
screw your word , man .
you needn &apos;t look so glum , lisbon .
if anything happens , you &apos;re not gonna be held responsible .
because that &apos;s what i &apos;m worried about .
you know why she &apos;s doing this .
to try and escape , most likely .
yet you &apos;re going through with it anyway .
are you doing this
because you need erica &apos;s help
or because you want it ?
agents , you can come in now .
you &apos;ll have to sign for custody .
thank you .
hello , patrick .
erica .
inmate erica marie flynn is now in your custody .
take good care of her .
thanks .
all right . who is he ?
who ?
natalie &apos;s killer . don &apos;t be cute .
oh , i don &apos;t know his name .
it &apos;s all in my symphony files .
did i not make that clear ?
no , you didn &apos;t .
must have slipped her mind .
where are the files ?
my lawyer is having them sent to your offices now .
good . let &apos;s get this over with .
you got her ?
we got her .
ms. flynn , i &apos;m agent mcclay .
this is agent morris .
we &apos;ll be supervising you during your furlough .
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
a friend of mine owns a car company ...
and has offered me transportation while i &apos;m out .
how thoughtful .
patrick , are you coming ?
okay .
this should be fun .
here &apos;s your tea .
thanks so much . oh , ron ?
yes , ms. flynn .
would you mind getting me some lemon for that ?
of course .
hey , boss .
i checked out that trip natalie took to puerto vallarta .
it seems she traveled alone .
she meet anybody there ?
i &apos;m not sure .
we &apos;ve been unable to locate her camera ,
but natalie did upload travel photos on to a web site ,
so i &apos;m having those printed out now .
okay .
what is it with this woman ?
uh , she can get men to do whatever she wants ,
and i can &apos;t for the life of me figure out why .
really ?
i get it . i mean , if i were a guy .
assault is a serious offense , trent .
man , that dude was a snitch .
is that why you were smashing his face in ?
hell , yeah . he &apos;s the reason why
i got sent to juvie in the first frickin &apos; place .
so you ran away from the youth facility
to get revenge ?
no , man . i left &apos; cause i had to .
i wasn &apos;t about to get jacked up .
you had a beef with one of the other kids ?
just one of my counselors-- big dude named danny .
danny vargas ?
yeah .
what happened ?
i mean , well , the night i took off , he , uh ...
he and natalie were fighting .
i mean , like , for real , you know ?
um , she-- she was yelling at him like crazy , man ,
all up in his face ,
but , uh , see , danny--
uh , he &apos;s real hard with us kids .
he , uh , i mean , he pushes us ,
smacks us around when no one &apos;s lookin &apos; ...
except this time natalie saw it go down .
she wasn &apos;t too happy about it , you know ?
i mean , the girl ...
girl just started flippin &apos; out on him .
did things get physical between them ?
oh , well , it was about to , until i stepped in .
i mean ... i mean , y @-@ you can &apos;t lay your hands on a woman .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t give a damn who you are .
but , anyway , i mean , danny got mad , real mad ,
so i took off before he could do something about it .
you think danny would have hurt you in retaliation ?
i know he would have .
the dude has frickin &apos; issues , man .
he--he should be the one sitting here , not me .
listen , with all bull aside ,
let me tell you something , all right ?
i would never hurt natalie , ever .
i @-@ i got no reason to .
i mean , she--she was one of the only adults
who ever treated me like a person , you know ?
yeah , i do .
hey . you okay ?
oh . oh , yeah . yeah .
uh , no . that video was ...
oh , god . it was horrible .
i had no idea that childbirth could be so ...
well , so scary .
oh , it wasn &apos;t that bad .
sarah , i &apos;m a homicide detective .
i &apos;ve seen some pretty graphic things ,
but that , uh , nothing prepared me for that .
how do you think i feel ? i have to go through it .
wayne , you &apos;re gonna be okay with this , right ?
yeah , i think so .
i @-@ i mean , yes . y @-@ yes .
all right . good . because i ...
i can &apos;t do this on my own .
i know .
what are you looking for in a man ?
well , someone generous ...
and caring .
someone who puts the needs of others before themselves .
i want a man i can grow old with ,
a best friend .
problem ?
this is so frustrating .
one of natalie &apos;s interviews is missing .
how unfortunate .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i had nothing to do with it .
it &apos;s not my problem if your people misplace things .
&quot; my people &quot; ?
all right . that &apos;s enough . let &apos;s go .
where ?
back to prison .
you shouldn &apos;t be out if you can &apos;t actually help ith the investigation .
well , just hang on a second .
just &apos; cause there &apos;s a video missing ,
doesn &apos;t mean she can &apos;t help find natalie &apos;s lover , right ?
absolutely . it &apos;s all right here .
natalie lived for her work .
she dedicated her life to helping others .
the fact that she found love without my service
can only mean one thing--
the man she was seeing was a co @-@ worker .
i tried that . no luck .
that &apos;s because she wasn &apos;t working at the youth facility
when she met him .
this was ten months ago , remember ?
mm . you mean when she was working
at the nonprofit , casa encantar ?
exactly .
shall we ?
we shall .
welcome to casa encantar . can i help you ?
yes . my fiance and i are looking
for a nonprofit to volunteer for .
let me show you around .
we &apos;re not usually this busy , but we &apos;re throwing
a fund @-@ raising event tomorrow night .
it &apos;s actually a release party
for a book that our c.e.o. has written .
here he is now .
hi . i &apos;m greg relin . welcome .
it &apos;s wonderful , what you do here .
thank you . since we started , we &apos;ve been lucky enough
to build six schools , four clinics , two orphanages ,
throughout mexico , all in small rural villages ,
some without electricity or running water .
that &apos;s our newest orphanage .
we hope to have four more just like it
by the end of the year .
if we raise enough support tomorrow night .
so evan &apos;s told you about our gala ?
there will be plenty of food and drink ,
even some entertainment .
you &apos;re both welcome to come .
see--see what a difference you can make .
wow . thank you very much for the invitation .
tell me , when did you last see natalie gibecki ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
don &apos;t be .
you said you were looking to volunteer .
no , i didn &apos;t . she did ,
and she also said i was her fiance . cheeky .
and you are who , exactly ?
i &apos;m patrick jane . i &apos;m a consultant with the cbi .
i &apos;m investigating natalie &apos;s murder .
she was seeing someone here , yes ?
not that i know of . evan ?
no .
no ?
oh , of course . it &apos;s a secret ,
so you wouldn &apos;t tell me anyway .
do you mind if i take a look around ,
talk to some of your employees ?
mm ... no .
thank you very much . good luck with the book .
what about him ?
handsome but dim , like a golden retriever .
natalie would never be interested in someone like that .
who would she be interested in ?
someone attractive , witty , compassionate ,
25 to 35,
fit , good hair , and a romantic at heart .
oh , that &apos;s all ?
no wonder she enlisted the help of a professional .
good ones are out there , if you know where to look .
natalie was a college girl . she read voraciously .
she was inquisitive , intelligent , and idealistic .
she would need to be with somebody who was the same .
him .
you buy me dinner at my restaurant of choice
if i &apos;m right .
no bet . you &apos;re right .
he &apos;s the only man that didn &apos;t look at you .
i &apos;ll spring for dinner
if you can get him to confess right now .
ooh . bet .
do your thing .
uh , you must be ...
uh , richard . can i help you ?
i &apos;m sorry . is this a bad time ?
i can see you &apos;re upset .
what ? no . no , i ... i &apos;m--i &apos;m fine .
uh , bad time for--for what ?
it &apos;s okay . natalie told me all about you .
i &apos;m ... sorry . natalie ?
you were having an affair with her .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i &apos;m a married man .
hey , don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t tell anyone .
natalie was a dear friend of mine .
her passing has been devastating for me .
i can &apos;t begin to imagine how you must feel right now .
there &apos;s no greater loss than the loss
of the person you love .
i didn &apos;t think that she had told anyone .
this is richard .
so there &apos;s this great little place downtown .
sicilian chef .
he does wonders with fish-- fresh , simple .
remarkable .
i &apos;m suddenly hungry .
hi , richard .
yes , we had an argument ,
but it wasn &apos;t a big deal .
you lied about it . that makes it a big deal .
i didn &apos;t think it was relevant .
your shift ended at 8 : 00 , the same time as natalie &apos;s .
where &apos;d you go after work ?
to dinner with a friend .
right afterwards ?
yes , about 8 : 30 .
this friend have a name ?
jim clark .
you don &apos;t think i had something to do with this , do you ?
this is insane . i didn &apos;t kill natalie .
what were you two arguing about ?
she didn &apos;t like the way i handled a situation with one of the kids .
she thought you were abusing him ?
i got in his face ,
maybe pushed him a little bit , okay ?
that &apos;s it . it wasn &apos;t abuse .
natalie came in here all bright @-@ eyed and bushy @-@ tailed ,
thinking she was gonna connect with these kids ,
and it &apos;s a great idea , but it doesn &apos;t work .
sometimes getting physical is the only thing
these animals respond to , you understand ?
yeah , you &apos;re right .
abusing kids is against the law .
do you understand ?
yeah .
good .
okay . thank you . bye .
well , richard eldridge
will be speaking with one of my colleagues
first thing tomorrow morning .
we make a good team , don &apos;t we ?
y @-@ you said you had a question .
oh , yes . that .
would you hate me if i told you i was lying ?
it &apos;s just these days i don &apos;t get to spend much time
alone with charming men .
well , there &apos;s a reason for that--
so you don &apos;t kill them .
we all have our baggage .
i &apos;ve been thinking about you a lot
over the past few months .
i often wonder how things would be ,
had we met under different circumstances .
thinking about what might have been will drive you crazy .
much better to think about what will happen in the future .
erica .
i like you , patrick .
i hope my directness doesn &apos;t make you uncomfortable .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
what am i doing ?
seducing me to conceal your true purpose ,
which is to escape .
am i ?
seducing you ?
no .
i &apos;m not trying to escape , patrick .
in fact , you don &apos;t actually believe i am .
no ?
no .
those agents outside the door aren &apos;t to keep me from escaping .
they &apos;re to keep you and i apart .
i know you have feelings for me .
this whole escape nonsense is just your way
of avoiding those feelings .
no , actually , i &apos;m fairly concerned
you might try to escape .
then ask yourself this .
if those agents weren &apos;t outside the door right now ,
what would you do ?
what will you do ?
what are these ?
pictures natalie gibecki took when she was on vacation
in puerto vallarta .
i was checking them to see if she met anyone ...
when she was down there .
did she ?
doesn &apos;t look like it .
i guess i was done with those .
natalie and i started seeing each other
about a year ago .
you were having an affair .
yes ...
but i wasn &apos;t just stringing her along .
uh , i planned to leave my wife .
it &apos;s just ... you know , it &apos;s complicated .
complicated ?
because your wife &apos;s family has millions of dollars
and you make minimum wage at a nonprofit ?
what did natalie think about your being married ?
she was patient at first .
she knew that i was unhappy .
recently , she got tired of waiting ,
so she broke things off .
when was that ?
two weeks ago .
we hardly spoke during the entire time .
i called her . i asked her to see me .
she wouldn &apos;t .
she said she needed to get away ,
clear her head .
and is that why she went to puerto vallarta ?
yes .
i just assumed that that was the end .
then a few days ago , she called .
she wanted to see me .
she was going to meet you the night she was killed ?
yes .
9 : 00 . the same little bar we always go to .
i waited an hour .
when she didn &apos;t show , i just ...
uh , i assumed that she had changed her mind .
i @-@ i know that-- that you &apos;re just--
you &apos;re doing your job , agent lisbon .
i would never do this to natalie .
i couldn &apos;t .
natalie was going to meet you the night she was killed--
a married man she was romantically involved with
who doesn &apos;t have an alibi for the night of her murder .
you &apos;ll forgive me if i &apos;m a little skeptical .
what about the boyfriend ?
he said he was going to meet natalie
the night she was killed .
here &apos;s the name of the place .
you and cho talk to the bartender .
see if anybody remembers seeing him .
okay .
where &apos;s erica , getting a mani @-@ pedi ?
how &apos;d you know ?
all right . this is getting ridiculous .
erica &apos;s served her purpose .
it &apos;s time to bring her back to prison .
oh , we can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
i need her .
mr. jane , ms. flynn , how nice to see you .
you are here as guests ?
uh , well , not--not exactly .
i hope there &apos;s not some problem .
mr. relin didn &apos;t tell you ?
tell me what ?
erica and i are performing tonight .
just a little something we &apos;ve been working on .
it &apos;s all been arranged .
um ... how fantastic .
well , let &apos;s hope .
thank you .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
my name is patrick jane .
for tonight and for a very good cause ,
let &apos;s all imagine that this , uh , tawdry hotel ballroom
is , in fact , the casa encantar ,
the enchanted house .
ladies and gentlemen , my lovely assistant erica .
erica and i will conjure up spirits
that will awe and amaze you ,
and then we will turn that awed amazement
into cold , hard cash
that will help feed , clothe , and educate
thousands of homeless orphans .
as you can see , erica has set the stage with four boxes .
now in order for this performance to work ,
we need four willing volunteers .
once you &apos;re chosen , please make your way
promptly to the stage .
don &apos;t be shy . this shouldn &apos;t hurt one little bit .
a quick hand for these brave souls .
thank you , erica .
looking fetching in green .
now , ladies and gentlemen ,
please pay close attention .
you &apos;re about to witness something
that i can pretty much guarantee you &apos;ve never seen before .
you will see ... something clouded in the unknown
in a world of clairvoyants and divination ,
a world of spirits .
now i know some of you don &apos;t believe
that spirits exist ,
but trust me when i tell you they are very real .
they &apos;re here in this room right now speaking to me ,
just as i am speaking to you ,
and they &apos;re telling me that one of these individuals here
is harboring a deep , dark secret .
huh ? don &apos;t believe me ?
fantastic . that gives me the chance to prove it to you .
you , sir . what &apos;s your name ?
richard .
richard , are you here alone ?
yes .
thank you . would you step forward ?
inside one of these boxes
is an item that holds great significance to you .
i don &apos;t know which box it &apos;s in , and neither do you .
am i correct ?
correct .
all right , richard . i need you to concentrate now .
i need you to concentrate and
clear your mind of any distractions .
i would like you to choose two boxes .
two boxes , either on the left side
or the right side , please .
erica .
there &apos;s two boxes left .
i &apos;d like you to choose one , richard .
now you made your choice only
with the spirits as your guide ?
yes .
erica , if you would , open the box , please .
does this necklace mean anything to you , richard ?
yes .
tell the audience what it means , richard .
it &apos;s the necklace that i gave to natalie .
why did you give it to her ?
it was a symbol of my deep and abiding ...
love ... for her .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
thank you , richard .
if you &apos;ll make your way back to your seat . that &apos;s okay .
wait ! the spirits are sending me another message .
they &apos;re telling me that someone else on this stage
has a secret .
mr. relin .
thank you .
a crowd favorite .
you &apos;re harboring a deep , dark secret , aren &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , really ?
well , let &apos;s check , shall we ? step forward , please .
clear your mind and choose two boxes .
erica .
now you know the drill . one box .
thank you .
now you chose this box of your own free will , yes ?
i guess so .
erica , please do the honors . open the box .
is this photograph of any significance to you ?
no .
are you certain ?
well , perhaps if you saw it bigger .
erica ?
now do you recognize it ?
it looks like the site you claim to
have built an orphanage on ,
only there &apos;s no orphanage .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
what about now ?
this &apos;s a photo taken a week ago .
there is no orphanage , greg ,
only a doctored photograph you &apos;ve been passing off as real .
everything you &apos;ve said you &apos;ve done is a lie , greg .
you don &apos;t understand .
oh , but i think they do .
you &apos;re under arrest .
let &apos;s go .
uh , thank you . you &apos;ve been a lovely audience .
thank you and good night .
you embezzled millions of dollars meant for charity
and siphoned the money into your own pockets .
you had everybody fooled
until natalie took that trip to mexico .
natalie called me , said she needed
to speak with me about something important ,
so i met her after work at the subway station .
i offered her a ride .
she told me she had visited
one of the orphanages that we built .
and she accused you of lying .
no .
not at first . she trusted me .
she wanted an explanation , but ...
i didn &apos;t have one . what could i say ?
she had the photos .
my whole world was threatened .
everything i &apos;ve built will be gone .
okay . i &apos;m coming .
wayne .
in here .
ohh . what is going on with you ?
take a seat .
sarah , i , uh ...
there &apos;s something i have to say to you .
okay .
so i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about us
these last few days ...
and , uh ... our situation .
&quot; our situation &quot; ?
yeah ...
and , uh ... i want it to change .
are you breaking up with me ?
the opposite .
will you marry me ?
oh , no .
no ?
i don &apos;t want to get married like this .
uh , like what ?
wayne , i don &apos;t want you to propose to me
just because i &apos;m pregnant .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s so not fair to you or to me .
i don &apos;t want to live the rest of my life
constantly wondering whether my husband loves me .
wayne . gosh , you are ...
you are a great man .
no , and you are going to be
the most amazing father ...
really , but ...
gosh , we are just not ready for this .
thank you , patrick .
you have no idea how much this meant to me .
you know , you didn &apos;t have to leave the other night .
we can &apos;t have everything we want .
since when ?
if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;m gonna go freshen up before the car ride .
don &apos;t bother . i know about your lawyer .
lawyer ? what lawyer ?
we found him a block away
with two suitcases , cash ,
and a forged passport .
i &apos;m sorry , erica .
i love you ! i &apos;ll wait for you !
touching .
so it &apos;s over .
you can &apos;t blame a girl for trying .
i &apos;d expect nothing less .
it was nice to see you , patrick .
i had a lovely time .
me , too .
good @-@ bye .
well , when you say it like that ,
it makes it sound like forever .
just 15 to 20 .

yes , sir . bottom of the page .
time to go , ma &apos;am .
of course .
glad that all worked out .
yeah .

from golden valley state correctional institution .
we &apos;re here to take custody of erica flynn .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m confused .
i just signed custody ...
sir ?
the u.s. marshals are helping with the search .
she &apos;s been flagged on flight lists
and all border crossings .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
thanks for your optimism .
i have to ask , jane .
did you know erica was gonna do this ?
try to escape ?
of course . i mean , who wouldn &apos;t ?
you didn &apos;t answer my question .
no , i didn &apos;t ...
answer your question .
hello ?
hello , patrick .
i wanted to thank you for dinner the other night .
it was the best date i &apos;ve had in years .
it wasn &apos;t a date .
if you say so .
where are you ?
someplace warm .
why ? do you miss me ?
something like that .
you know , patrick , we &apos;d have been good together .
would be good together .
i will find you . it &apos;s only a matter of time .
oh , patrick .
