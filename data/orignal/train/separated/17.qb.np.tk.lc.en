good morning .
an hour ago , i withdrew my name from contention
for the office of state &apos;s attorney .
i did so with great regret
but also with a deep conviction
that neither i , nor anyone associated with my campaign ,
was responsible for tampering with voting machines .
but a partial recount of select precincts
has led me to believe
that it is detrimental to the democratic process
for cook county to be subjected
to a long and drawn @-@ out recount .
i would like to thank
my supporters for their faith in me
and my husband , who has been ...
... has been amazing during this difficult time .
thank you .
mrs. florrick ! mrs. florrick ! over here ! mrs. florrick !
mr. governor !
what do i do now ?
mrs. nolfi .
i find that the state has proved their case against you ,
and as a result , i must find you guilty .
i do wish i had some discretion as to a sentence ,
but the number of pills in your possession triggered
what is called a mandatory minimum sentence
of six to 30 years .
i do not believe you deserve such a sentence ,
but i am handcuffed .
however , there are still 48 hours
until the sentence must be imposed .
if you can bring me evidence
that will allow me to revisit your conviction ,
i will gladly do so .
mandatory minimum sentencing .
that &apos;s why i brought you four here together today .
jim , bob ,
just &apos; cause you &apos;re two of the most conservative lawyers
i ever met doesn &apos;t mean you get to tease cary and diane
about their backward liberal ways . anyway ,
this is one area where our political philosophies overlap .
liberals think that mandatory minimums
are draconian and unfair .
we think they &apos;re wasteful and unfair .
either way , we agree : a policy that &apos;s failed .
are we agreed on the test case ?
yes , sir . steven mercurio .
house painter .
he became addicted to painkillers after back surgery ,
gave some to a friend who turned out to be an undercover cop .
his mandatory sentence : 12 years .
jim , bob , we agreed on this ?
for an extra $ 200 an hour ,
you can actually get &apos; em to speak .
i think we should consider someone else .
well , a divide in the liberal caucus . what a surprise .
louise nolfi , a 62 @-@ year @-@ old grandmother .
she delivered a package to the post office .
a drug @-@ sniffing dog alerted to it .
they opened the package and found 26 tablets
of mdma , ecstasy ,
a six @-@ year mandatory minimum .
where &apos;s the file ?
oh , i don &apos;t have one . i just came from court .
we &apos;ve got a demo problem .
jailed grandmothers , people can pity .
jailed white guys ,
people can identify .
the house painter , i think .
r.d.
meet her first .
why ?
you should have all the facts .
meeting grandmothers isn &apos;t facts .
it &apos;s manipulative kitsch . and you know it .
then why not meet her ?
you &apos;re gonna defend her either way , aren &apos;t you ?
yes .
the soft @-@ hearted liberal in her natural habitat .
ms. lockhart , alicia &apos;s here .
lockhart , agos &amp; lee .
how may i direct your call ?
alicia &apos;s here . i didn &apos;t know she was coming back .
hey , alicia .
i &apos;m so sorry about everything .
thank you .
come on . they &apos;re waiting .
water ?
thank you .
so-- thank you--
alicia and i have been talking , as most of you know .
and i called her right after her ... announcement .
i wish you hadn &apos;t backed down , alicia .
thank you , david .
and we &apos;ve talked about it internally here , too , and ...
well ...
we want you to come back as name partner .
and , um ...
you &apos;re not worried about my ...
situation ?
what , a voter fraud scandal ?
you mean , after i almost went to jail for six years ?
what about you , david ? do you agree with this ?
i agree with anything that maintains stability .
kalinda and i are having some troubles
with the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
we &apos;re dealing with it .
and ...
my exit package , we already negotiated it .
bring your lawyer back in , and we &apos;ll figure it out .
this is home , alicia .
welcome home .
thank you .
geneva pine .
it &apos;s cary .
what can i do for you ?
i &apos;ve thought it over , and i &apos;ll do it .
do what ?
turn evidence against bishop .
what evidence , cary ?
i &apos;ll only do it if i have your guarantee
you &apos;ll drop the charges against kalinda and diane .
okay .
give me a day to get some ducks in a row ,
and i &apos;ll get back to you .
odd how things turn out .
a month ago , no one wanted to turn on bishop .
now everybody does .
that was cary .
what do you need from me ?
evidence on bishop &apos;s drug operation ,
his subsidiary businesses , all illegal activities .
look , i won &apos;t testify .
get me something i can use independently
and you won &apos;t need to testify .
you can &apos;t make a deal with cary .
i told him i needed a day .
get me something before then .
i &apos;m not gonna talk about my grandson .
he &apos;s turning his life around .
i know , mrs. nolfi .
the truth is , the judge is sympathetic with your situation ,
but we need to give him a reason to overturn your verdict .
have you talked to your public defender ?
mr. bollinger ? no . why ?
well , the judge may be angry with mr. bollinger
for not doing a better job .
we can overturn the verdict by arguing ineffective assistance .
i don &apos;t want to get him in trouble .
he &apos;s such a lovely man .
he won &apos;t get into trouble ,
but let me talk to him .
now , gentlemen ...
... in this country ,
our courts are the great levelers .
and in our courts ,
all men are ... created ...
equal .
so is this what made you want to become a lawyer ?
no .
it made a lot of ...
people at school want to become lawyers ,
but they &apos;re all ... prosecutors and tax lawyers now .
... reality .
i like when people give speeches ,
and it makes other people change their mind .
i know . me , too .
do you ever get to do that ?
in court ?
no .
it &apos;s mostly about facts and evidence .
most of the time you don &apos;t really have someone you believe in .
that &apos;s too bad .
maybe it &apos;ll be different this time .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m going back to the law firm .
what ?
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great .
in the name of god ...
do your duty .
um , do you want me to pause it ?
no . i know how it ends .
mr. gallagher , hello .
thank you for returning my call .
i know you were wondering if i was heading back to my firm ,
and it looks like i am .
you are ? you &apos;re going back now ?
yes . definitely .
but i just got a call from lockhart / agos
saying you weren &apos;t going back .
oh , well , that &apos;s a mistake .
uh , it @-@ it must be an old message .
no , i just got it an hour ago .
from who ? david lee ?
no , diane lockhart .
you ...
diane called you ?
yeah , she was worried i would leave the firm ,
and i told her i was keeping my options open .
so she asked me to hold off on calling you for a day or two .
that surprised me , so i &apos;m calling you now .
uh , mr. gallagher , i &apos;m gonna ...
have to get back to you , okay ?
of course .
damn it .
they had no intention of bringing me back .
they never did . they have been playing out
this charade so they can cherry @-@ pick my clients .
well , even if they are , you can &apos;t make it personal .
sure , i can . i started that firm .
here . in my home .
we had so few outlets ,
we were running cables into grace &apos;s room .
then hit &apos; em back . florrick @-@ agos--
or whatever they &apos;re called now--
they &apos;re not the only game in town . you have other options .
i &apos;m officially a scandal , peter .
you should know that better than anyone .
no one wants a sullied lawyer .
they want a good lawyer ,
and you have enough clients to go on your own .
i &apos;m just tired , peter .
all right , answer me this .
if you went solo ,
how many of your clients would follow ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe 20 .
well , that &apos;s a pretty good book of business for day one .
where would i even get the seed money ?
your exit package . go back in there ...
make as if nothing &apos;s wrong , just be all smiles ,
and then get them to rip up your exit package .
you lost a lot of money on that package , right ?
kalinda .
dex .
what do you want ?
did you know that bishop &apos;s leaving the business ?
what business ?
he &apos;s , uh ... he &apos;s worried about being betrayed ,
so he &apos;s turning evidence .
where &apos;d you hear that ?
geneva pine .
the asa ?
she &apos;s playing you .
he &apos;s doing it for dylan .
wants to stay out of jail so he can be a dad .
look , pine says there &apos;s room
for only one person to turn evidence .
you need to get out of my car .
i came to you because i want to keep my job .
bishop goes ...
you &apos;ll be number one .
hey . if this is some type of a loyalty test from bishop ,
you tell him i said to kiss my ass .
i would never turn on him , ever .
thank you for taking the time to listen to our concerns .
no problem-- that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
and thank you for listening to our concerns .
no problem . happy to accommodate .
so you would like to renegotiate your exit package ?
mm , no , not renegotiate ; rescind .
ah . meaning what ?
meaning : since i am returning , it seems more sensible to just ...
void it .
like alicia never left .
well , the issue , of course--
and it &apos;s an unfortunate one--
is that alicia &apos;s equity is already settled out .
mm , on the cheap .
which was understandable at the time ,
but alicia &apos;s going to need to be made whole again
if she returns , and rather than waste time
restoring the status quo ,
it makes more sense just to keep the status quo ,
don &apos;t you think ?
well , alicia , i think all david is saying
is this proposal is a bit of a curveball .
more of a slider , i &apos;d say-- give us a couple of swings ,
you can probably still hit it .
no problem . take all the time you need .
alicia ...
i didn &apos;t believe it before , but i think you &apos;re right
they &apos;re playing you .
why do you think that ?
because they should &apos;ve just said no
to rescinding your exit package ,
but they delayed .
they &apos;re stalling you .
to get my clients ?
so what do i do ?
start working the phones fast .
get your clients on board before they do , because ...
they don &apos;t want you back .
we want her back , david .
yes , but if we tear up her exit contract ,
she gets all her power back .
first @-@ tier equity package , a seat on the ...
what difference does it make ? we want her back .
yes , but on our terms , not hers .
she &apos;s a founding member of this firm .
i say we swallow the cost .
and i say you two are burning money
out of a misguided sense of loyalty .
let &apos;s at least run it by the finance committee .
fine . but let &apos;s start calling back alicia &apos;s clients ,
assuring them she &apos;s staying .
i &apos;m afraid alicia might get the wrong idea if she heard
that we were calling them before .
you have been a public defender for less than a year , mr. bollinger ?
yeah . ten months .
oops . sorry .
i see . and , um ...
so how familiar are you with illinois criminal procedure ?
i &apos;ve been getting up to speed . it &apos;s complicated , though .
looking for louise &apos;s file .
oh , here it is .
uh ... sorry about the mustard stain .
so , um ...
you made the decision not to take issue with the prosecution &apos;s
charge of intent to distribute ?
oh , that &apos;s right .
yeah , there &apos;s video evidence of her mailing a package
with 26 tabs of ecstasy .
these are good notes .
thank you .
yeah , that &apos;s the way justice ginsburg liked them .
justice ginsburg ?
as in , um ...
the supreme court justice .
yeah . i clerked with her for a year
before joining the justice department .
look , i @-@ i think you &apos;re going to have a hard time
proving ineffective assistance , unfortunately .
i mean , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going for , right ?
i &apos;m incompetent ?
no hard feelings , but yeah .
i wish i could have given you something ,
but unfortunately , i did a pretty good job at trial .
i mean , if she were a regular street criminal ,
you could get her into a probationary program like tasc .
for drug addicts ?
right . she wouldn &apos;t see a day of jail .
it &apos;s odd-- her having never used drugs is actually worse .
she could get probation if you could prove she &apos;s a drug addict .
unbelievable .
yeah . i was going to talk
to her presentencing officer about it ...
that &apos;s a good idea .
i will go do that .
only in america , right ?
you know , you &apos;re a grandma , go to jail .
you &apos;re a drug addict , go to rehab .
you wonder why people like me are into smaller government .
oh , yes , that &apos;s right-- smaller government
would have no such ironies .
perhaps there &apos;d be smaller ironies .
seriously ?
that &apos;s your experience of life ?
smaller things are purer ?
it actually is my experience of life , yeah .
do you want me to step out ?
stay put .
what i find disgusting is the republicans
will starve a democracy of funds ,
and then complain that society &apos;s dysfunctional .
nobody is starving anybody of anything .
mr. gallagher , i wanted to get back to you first .
diane made a mistake yesterday .
as it turns out ...
alicia florrick is returning to the fold .
dear god , you all need to get your stories straight .
i have alicia right now on the other line ,
and she says she &apos;s starting her own firm
and she wants me to come with her .
uh , jim ,
can you give me a moment ?
i &apos;ll check in with them .
oh . uh , david ,
do you know reese dipple ?
only by reputation .
david lee , family law .
very nice to meet you , sir .
call me r.d.
r.d. , simple , american .
i &apos;m a conservative , too , sir .
really ?
yes . diane , do you have a minute ?
alicia &apos;s playing us .
what do you mean ?
she &apos;s on the phone , as we speak ,
trying to steal james gallagher away .
she &apos;s starting her own firm . again .
she &apos;s dragging this out so we won &apos;t pursue her clients .
meanwhile , she &apos;s locking them down .
then why would she insist on voiding her exit package ?
for money .
so she doesn &apos;t have to renegotiate her contract
with a gun to her head .
gallagher just called me-- i got him on hold .
while he &apos;s got her on hold .
uh , cary .
we need a minute .
jim , uh , i have cary agos
and diane lockhart here with me .
we just want to reiterate how much your business means to us .
i appreciate that , but i just want some stability ,
do you understand ?
mr. gallagher ,
you say you have alicia on the other line right now ?
yep .
why don &apos;t you tell her you &apos;ll get back to her ,
and we will resolve this shortly .
fine . but i got to tell you , this is starting to get old .
i don &apos;t believe it .
that &apos;s because the last time
she pulled this crap , you were on her side .
you really want to get into this now ?
stop it . stop . alicia &apos;s watching .
dad ?
mr. bishop ?
he must be up .
i &apos;ll , uh , wait in the car till he gets back .
dylan ?
up here .
you &apos;re here .
yeah . i , uh ... i didn &apos;t want to leave dylan alone .
actually , uh ... i &apos;m surprised you weren &apos;t home .
why ?
nothing .
i ... i just saw dexter heading out--
i figured you two were together .
well , i &apos;m here now .
you can go .
thank you .
thanks , sir .
was dylan downloading music or something ?
no .
somebody used a flash drive to download files .
can you tell who ?
every time a usb device is connected to a computer ,
all the details-- the serial number ,
the class of device-- it &apos;s all stored in the registry .
so you can trace it ?
yes .
she &apos;s stabbing us in the back .
we don &apos;t know that yet .
james gallagher could just ...
it &apos;s not just gallagher .
i spoke with paisley and tanya page--
she reached out to both of them , too .
kalinda , you &apos;re just gonna sit there ?
yeah . alicia would never do this .
she &apos;s already done it-- she did it last year ,
and she &apos;s doing it again .
she had a reason to do it last year .
oh , how does it feel , cary , to be betrayed ...
david ... david , what do you suggest ?
that we play coy , string her along in negotiations
until we have a chance to call the rest of her clients
and convince them to stay .
hey , dad , i &apos;m home .
is kalinda with you ?
uh , yes , sir .
do you have a minute ?
hey , jamir .
why don &apos;t you head upstairs ? i &apos;ll be right up .
i got an &quot; a &quot; in algebra .
i &apos;m proud of you .
when you came to my house ,
did you go into my study ?
no .
did you log onto my computer ?
no .
you saw dexter leaving when you drove up .
you said you saw dexter leaving here when you drove dylan home .
look , uh , i don &apos;t want to get anyone into trouble .
why would anybody get into trouble ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you still want me to stay , sir ?
yes .
hey , boss . what you need ?
some information .
someone used a flash drive to download files from my computer .
okay .
flash drives leave their fingerprints behind .
did you know that ?
no .
i didn &apos;t either .
this flash drive was given the name
d.r. &apos; s jams no.2
uh , boss ... i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i keep two flash drives in my car ,
but they have all my music on &apos; em and ...
i didn &apos;t ... i mean , i would never ...
h @-@ hold on .
oh , no . no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
i think you should come over here , dex .
dex .
um , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll call you back .
i &apos;ll call you back .
do you want anything more from me , sir ?
no . maybe tomorrow .
no problem .
d.r. &apos; s jams ? who &apos;s d.r. ?
dexter roja .
why do you have his flash drive ?
i took it from his car .
why ?
you have everything you need on that to take bishop down .
this doesn &apos;t come back to me .
and you leave cary and diane out of it .
um , i &apos;m looking for the pre @-@ sentence officer on duty .
oh , thank you .
thank you so much . appreciate it .
may i help you ?
i &apos;m here for louise nolfi . i &apos;m her attorney .
oh . joy .
no .
i told him it &apos;s not true .
would you like me to return ?
no . sit .
no . i have to go . you tell him it &apos;s not true .
all right ?
now ...
uh , it &apos;s louise nolfi . n @-@ o @-@ l ...
yeah , i know .
you were cary agos &apos; attorney ,
weren &apos;t you ?
i was .
and lemond bishop &apos;s lawyer , too .
yes .
okay , this is it . louise nolfi .
possession with intent .
26 tablets of mdma .
yes . unfortunately for this client , that &apos;s typical .
she &apos;s has quite a high tolerance .
that why i &apos;m talking to you and not her ?
uh , well , mrs. nolfi has a ...
a serious issue .
no mention of any history of , uh , drug use here .
well , no , it &apos;s not something she advertises .
she has children and grandchildren .
so how soon can she get here ?
i beg your pardon ?
drug addiction or not ,
i need to evaluate her before i make a recommendation to the court .
does she really have to come in ?
yeah .
well , how about tomorrow ?
it &apos;s unfortunate , but this election scandal
has tainted the florrick name .
i &apos;m afraid most judges would find themselves
biased against alicia right now .
oh , i know ,
those allegations were terrible .
not to mention those e @-@ mails she sent .
so the payment schedule of the exit agreement
was tied to alicia taking office ,
but she never actually took office .
therefore the exit agreement is , unfortunately , void on its face .
so , um , i &apos;m sorry ,
where does that , uh ,
leave us ?
it seems i &apos;m still partner .
uh , forgive me , but i think we &apos;re gonna need a minute to discuss this .
that bitch .
she &apos;s right about the exit deal .
she never took office .
so tell her there &apos;s a new capital call .
all partners have to pony up an additional
$ 250,000 for improvements .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s a ploy , you idiots .
you know , i almost admire her .
we stall her to go after her clients ,
so she stalls us to go after ours .
how dare you ?
going after reese dipple ?
you &apos;ve never even met him .
excuse me ?
david &apos;s been on the phone with every one of your old clients ,
and they &apos;ve all received calls from you .
to tell them i &apos;m coming back .
no , to poach them .
i &apos;m sorry ,
are you really accusing me of poaching ?
this whole negotiation has been a charade .
you had no intention of bringing me back here .
because you betrayed us . no , diane ,
because you betrayed me .
get out of here , alicia .
get out of here now .
lemond bishop . chicago pd . you &apos;re under arrest .
you got to be kidding me , right ? with my son here ?
turn around , please , sir .
dad .
i &apos;m all right , dylan .
what do you want me to do , lemond ?
call my lawyer .
and tell dexter he &apos;s dead .
what is going on , geneva ? what happened ?
cary ?
yes , cary .
you were getting back to me .
now i hear bishop was arrested . what did you do ?
i found another way .
you found another way with kalinda ?
cary , just stay out of this . this has nothing to do with you .
you &apos;re gonna get her killed .
it started after my husband died .
i got the shakes .
you know , my hands .
i needed the drugs .
um , wasn &apos;t money tight , louise ?
oh , yes . oh , yeah .
a friend gave me a couple pills .
oxycodone .
roxy , i called them .
that &apos;s the street name , when i was on the street .
i see . and where are you getting your supply now ?
i have my man .
down the
on the street .
the street where i live .
where my man gets me drugs .
i need the drugs .
uh @-@ huh . do you find that taking drugs
helps you to avoid or relieve , uh ,
withdrawal symptoms ?
oh , yeah , all the time .
i mean , sometimes all i have is my high .
or i get the shakes .
the . you know .
okay , thank you ,
ms. nolfi .
you &apos;re welcome .
i mean , just so you know
i want to get this horse off of my back .
monkey ?
what ?
monkey off your back ?
no , horse .
yeah , horse .
okay , she &apos;s not a junkie .
she doesn &apos;t fit the cliché , but
i understand that mandatory minimums are unfair , ma &apos;am ,
but i cannot recommend that a non @-@ addict be put into rehab .
i &apos;m
sorry .
where &apos;s kalinda ?
she &apos;s not here .
well , i need to leave a message .
someone turned on bishop , and it was not me .
she needs to tell bishop ...
it &apos;s not her either .
what ?
geneva pine approached me to turn evidence .
kalinda wasn &apos;t involved . it was me .
it was you ? how could it be you ?
i gave pine what i knew .
you did ? you ...
she was in my car .
kalinda .
she took it ?
took what ?
i &apos;m such an idiot . the flash drive .
she did this ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
tell kalinda that i need to see her now .
she has nothing to do with this .
you tell her ... i need to see her .
alicia is still a part of this firm .
she was a partner in another firm
and she stole how many clients ?
uh , chumhum
ring a bell ?
hello ?
alicia ?
uh , do you have a minute ?
what , so diane can cut my exit package again ?
alicia , what the hell &apos;s going on ?
you tell me .
diane and david lee
think you &apos;re poaching clients .
they &apos;re the ones
who &apos;ve been stringing me along for days , lying to my clients .
no , no , they @-@ they wanted to bring you back , but then
you called james gallagher and said you were leaving .
no , no , no , no .
he called me .
diane went behind my back and told him i was out .
no , she didn &apos;t .
wait ...
when did gallagher say diane called ?
right after our meeting .
alicia , diane called before the meeting ,
before she even knew you wanted to come back .
i know &apos; cause i was there .
she knew i was coming in .
yes , but she didn &apos;t know
why you were coming in .
well , david lee
is calling my clients right now .
because of you . because of what you did .
so you &apos;re saying this is a misunderstanding ?
i &apos;m saying that you need to call diane right now .
how long you been here ?
a few hours .
did you get bishop arrested ?
cary , don &apos;t worry . i , uh ...
i handled it .
so you &apos;re not in trouble ?
no .
dexter roja was here .
wanted your help in figuring out who turned on bishop .
oh , that &apos;s good .
i said it wasn &apos;t you .
said i was the one who turned on bishop .
wh ... why did you do that , cary ?
didn &apos;t want you to get in trouble .
i wasn &apos;t in trouble .
he mentioned a flash drive .
he said he just realized
that you were the one who took it from his car .
what &apos;s going on , kalinda ?
nothing .
i know it &apos;s something .
when you talk that way , it &apos;s always something .
no , no , i ... i can take care of it .
you &apos;re in trouble .
no .
can i help you ? please ?
no .
diane ?
do you have a minute ? i think we need to talk .
yes , i think we do .
grace . hi .
is your mom in ?
um , no , she stepped out .
uh , do you want me to call her for you ?
no . uh , i wanted to talk to her in person .
um , can i get you anything ?
uh , no , thank you .
uh , please , have a seat .
thanks .
smile .
diane ?
i got your e @-@ mail . what &apos;s up ?
yeah , i , um ... i took another look at the lab report again .
louise nolfi was caught with 26 ecstasy tablets ,
but the price attached to the pills was $ 500 .
so ?
so , the street value would be double that .
either someone &apos;s getting a great deal ,
or there was a problem with the amount of drugs .
interesting . we &apos;ll talk to the lab tomorrow .
yeah , you need to call them first thing in the morning .
uh , i @-@ i won &apos;t be in .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
did alicia call you ?
no . she came in .
we apologized to each other .
i &apos;m glad .
life &apos;s too short to be mad .
well , you &apos;re sounding philosophical .
yeah .
i &apos;ll see you , diane .
are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
take care of yourself , okay ?
you , too .
i &apos;m gonna get a snack . you sure you don &apos;t want anything ?
yeah . uh ... i have to go now .
grace ...
would you give this to your mom , please ?
sure .
just whenever would be great .
okay .
bye .
good @-@ bye .
you &apos;re sure of this , ms. lockhart ?
i am , your honor .
i personally inspected the evidence this morning ,
and here is an affidavit from the custodian at the lab .
the charge says that mrs. nolfi was caught
with 26 tablets of ecstasy .
but in fact , the tablets had been cut in half , which means
that there were really only 13 tablets in the package .
and the threshold number for the mandatory minimum to apply is ...
15 tablets , your honor .
then it is my pleasure to inform you , mrs. nolfi ,
that i am finding you guilty of possession
of only 13 tablets of ecstasy ,
and therefore , will be sentencing you
to six months probation ,
which will hereby be deemed ... served .
we need to bring alicia on board .
alicia came by last night and apologized .
because we have her by the throat .
no , i apologized , too . it was all a misunderstanding .
good .
then we should bring her back .
no , you shouldn &apos;t .
mr. dipple , i &apos;m sorry , but
if you could give us a minute ,
we have an urgent personnel matter to resolve .
you resolve away . but for what it &apos;s worth ,
if alicia florrick returns , i will be moving on .
had the conversation with diane this morning .
what ?
i may not see eye @-@ to @-@ eye with all y &apos;all
when it comes to politics .
worry not , sir .
you and i are on the same page .
but i do value integrity .
yes , and no one has more than alicia .
mr. agos , i am scrutinized heavily--
by the press , bloggers of every stripe .
now , i can deal with the scandal that diane &apos;s involved with ,
but i do have my limits .
look , alicia did nothing wrong .
you and i both know that doesn &apos;t matter .
the florrick name ?
it &apos;s like george ryan or blagojevich .
it &apos;s just another in a long line of corrupt chicago pols .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but it &apos;s just how it is .
excuse me . mr. agos ?
no answer from kalinda . she &apos;s not in today .
did you try her at home ?
yeah , it just kept ringing .
did you try her on her cell ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
the number you have reached is not in service .
kalinda ?
who called you ?
diane .
wow . well , that &apos;s payback
for dropping her as supreme court justice .
no . it isn &apos;t .
well , screw &apos; em . start your own firm .
i don &apos;t have any clients .
call your old clients , and just tell them ...
i did .
no one wants to stay .
i mean , colin sweeney , but ...
i &apos;m damaged goods .
listen ...
give it time .
look at me . a year after jail , i was back in the s.a. &apos; s office .
i &apos;m tired , peter .
it &apos;s okay . be tired .
rest , read a book .
recharge the batteries .
eli was talking about getting a ghostwriter .
i think you should write a book .
about ?
you . your story , your political philosophy .
people are interested .
they &apos;re more interested in you than me .
you can do it , alicia .
you can come back from this .
i know it .
