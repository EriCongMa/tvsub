sorry about that , mr ....
mcveigh .
oh , my goodness . what an unfortunate name .
hopefully no relation ?
oh , um , i &apos;ve offended you ?
no . no . i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
i think i &apos;ve just been visited by the marlboro man .
i played craps with that kid &apos;s life .
will , you listen ,
i know you did everything .
we &apos;re not gonna talk about this .
we &apos;re not gonna say any more .
we &apos;re gonna go to dinner in one week &apos;s time ,
and we &apos;ll talk then .
let &apos;s go to the bedroom .
no . here .
so we can talk now , right ?
i mean , the trial &apos;s over.we can talk now .
yeah , we can talk .
we can swear . we can do whatever we want .
okay , so , we &apos;ll do bathroom breaks first ,
then , uh , get down to it .
so , uh , what do you think ?
guilty , right ? she did it .
actually , i think we should wait . for everybody .
did you see her at the defense table ?
which her ?
the one with the televangelist ?
no , no , no . um ,
the one who sucked the toes .
oh , come on . what was his name ?
the prostitute .
you &apos;re talking about the defense attorney ?
she &apos;s the wife , right ?
right . i thought i recognized her at the defense table .
reasonable doubt .
what do we mean by reasonable doubt ?
i thought the husband got out . didn &apos;t he get out ?
boy , talk about using her .
putting her at the defense table like that .
she &apos;s there &apos; cause she &apos;s a good lawyer .
okay . okay , okay .
everybody ready ?
do we want to vote first ?
right . good idea .
um , everyone take a pad .
so when you take that vote ,
you have to ask yourself ,
is this young woman
capable of murder ?
could bianca price pick up a gun
and shoot her sorority mate in the chest ?
okay .
six guilty , six not guilty .
of course .
which is so odd ,
given we have six men and six women .
oh , what are you saying ?
this is a sexist thing ?
well , of course not . this has nothing to do with her looks .
true .
that &apos;s right .
she &apos;s just a sweet girl having a threesome .
that &apos;s because men can &apos;t imagine a pretty woman killing somebody .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s because the prosecution didn &apos;t do their job .
exactly .
oh , fine .
sure , i voted not guilty , but not because of her looks .
why isn &apos;t it just as likely that women are jealous of her looks ?
thank you , brother .
you are so over the line .
thank you .
he &apos;s right .
so over the line .
he &apos;s right .
women look at that girl and think home wrecker .
except she &apos;s not a girl . she &apos;s a grown woman .
okay , but saint-- what @-@ what &apos;s her name ?
alicia .
right , alicia florrick .
she was sitting right next to her , supporting her .
and defense attorneys could never be pulling tricks .
let &apos;s just stick to the facts , huh ?
all right , all right , everybody ,
raised hands , please .
one at a time .
marisol .
okay , take the cop , the detective .
back on the first day of testimony ,
he looked right at us and said ...
the accused was covered with blood .
and she was the only one in the room with the victim .
and the murder weapon ?
9mm auto 6 @-@ round .
it was the defendant &apos;s ,
registered in her name .
given to her by her mother for protection .
the weapon was found on the ground by her feet ?
yes , sir .
with her fingerprints on the trigger .
i have a question .
who was the girl who entered in the middle of his testimony ?
oh , that &apos;s right . he smiled at her .
i thought she was with the defense .
there was a party downstairs for spring break .
30 individuals .
and they heard the shot ?
yes , sir .
within 30 seconds , they burst into the sorority room
and found the accused , bianca price , standing over the victim .
how long after the murder was this photo taken ?
approximately 30 seconds .
it &apos;s the good news about murders at colleges these days .
everybody has a cell phone camera ,
so it makes it hard to get away with murder .
objection !
that wasn &apos;t a question , mr. gardner .
but i would warn the witness to avoid editorializing .
my apologies , your honor .
now , this happened at her sorority house ?
yes , sir .
there was blood all over her .
and this was taken within 30 seconds of the gunshot ,
and here she is with the gun at her feet .
she said she was in the bathroom , and she came out .
no , she didn &apos;t say that .
her lawyer said that .
now bianca has said she was in the bathroom when she heard the shot .
objection , your honor . not in evidence .
mr. gardner , i expect more of you .
your honor , i &apos;m sorry . my mistake .
okay , i &apos;ll say it .
i didn &apos;t trust that cop .
and his earring . what was that ?
men wear earrings these days .
and what about the five o &apos;clock shadow ?
so what are you saying ?
you don &apos;t trust him because he didn &apos;t shave ?
so , detective burton , you were the first officer on the scene ?
yes , mr. gardner .
and where was your partner ?
he was out sick .
so you were there unobserved ?
yes , i was unobserved ,
except for the two dozen other college students in the room .
and you &apos;ve never tampered with evidence , detective ?
that &apos;s correct , sir .
i &apos;ve never tampered with evidence .
and so if i asked you about this internal affairs report ...
objection , your honor !
mr. gardner , really .
up here .
then what about the internal affairs report ?
what internal affairs report ? !
we didn &apos;t hear anything about that .
it could have been completely innocent .
are you serious ?
this charge is irrelevant , and it was minor .
drinking beer on duty ?
you are playing with fire here , mr. gardner .
your honor ,
any internal affairs charge is completely relevant .
no , sir . you &apos;re trying to imply to the jury
that something more nefarious is going on here--
that detective burton planted evidence .
let &apos;s at least be adults here
and admit to each other what you &apos;re doing .
your honor , no . oh @-@ oh , my god ,
no . no . i ...
look , i will admonish the jury .
that &apos;s all i can do , mr. brody .
and you watch it , mr. gardner .
go to hell .
having fun ?
wait . wait . wait .
the judge admonished us not to consider it .
all right , i won &apos;t consider it ,
but i still don &apos;t trust speedy .
we &apos;ll reconvene here 9 : 30 tomorrow .
so , you enjoy tarnishing my reputation ?
best part of my day .
hey , jimmy , man .
what &apos;s up ?
i don &apos;t think they liked me .
who , the jury ? no . you can never tell .
i just ...
sound so terrible .
i think i &apos;d find me guilty .
no , that &apos;s just the prosecution &apos;s case .
you wait for our turn .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome . any time .
thank you .
i &apos;ll see you , mom .
how did it go , did you think ?
it &apos;s a good start .
i &apos;m sorry , but we &apos;re playing catch @-@ up here .
your previous lawyers did no investigation ,
and cuesta isn &apos;t allowing a delay ,
so we &apos;re gonna hit a few bumps .
we &apos;re gonna need to spend some more money
on a better ballistics expert .
are you all right with that ?
whatever it takes .
she &apos;s my only child .
the thought of her in prison is ...
good work .
thanks .
is everything okay ?
yeah . why ? yeah . good .
i heard you did well .
there &apos;s more women on this jury than i wanted .
sometimes i think
justice would be better served with a coin flip .
who &apos;s that ?
oh , uh , mother jones .
doing a profile .
sorry about that .
we &apos;re knee @-@ deep in the bianca price trial .
you were just saying about pro @-@ choice .
oh , yes , it &apos;s an irony of our times
that &quot; activist judge &quot; used to be a charge hurled by republicans at ...
democrats ?
excuse me ?
hurled at democrats ?
oh , uh , yes .
i was , um ...
the charge of activist judge ,
especially with regards to ...
my goodness , i forgot what i was , uh , saying .
choice is endangered .
oh , yes , choice .
it is .
could you give me a minute ?
thank you for the sarah palin biography .
oh , i , uh , i thought you &apos;d like that .
the chapter where she brings big oil to heel .
just gripping .
i bought a , uh ... a hillary bio
for 50 cents on ebay .
so you &apos;re , uh ...
will says he wants you on the bianca price murder ?
yeah . yeah .
i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m in town testifying on another case .
good .
well , i @-@ i just wanted to say hello .
hello .
you betcha .
uh , you know my rules .
if , uh ... if i find out the client &apos;s guilty , i quit .
yup . i like your rules .
even more , i like your fees .
well , th ...
yeah ?
i thought i &apos;d sit in .
miss lockhart .
mr. mcveigh .
so , the problem is ,
the mom fired her previous lawyers
because they wanted to plead this out .
so they lined up jim crosby as a ballistics expert .
well , i agreed to meet with you .
you did . thanks .
and i agreed to look over the evidence , give you a bid .
which is ?
i &apos;m not taking this case .
she &apos;s guilty .
sorry .
i can give you some names of people who will say differently ,
but i wouldn &apos;t go with crosby .
he &apos;s not convincing enough .
um , you &apos;re positive ?
she &apos;s guilty ?
given the evidence , yes .
if i were you , i &apos;d plead out .
good luck .
the jury needs to be told a story .
the prosecution &apos;s story is simple :
bianca shot her best friend out of jealousy after a threesome .
our story needs to be just as simple :
bianca didn &apos;t shoot heather .
yes , it was bianca &apos;s gun ,
but her mother had given it her for protection .
what we need to tell the jury is who else had access to bianca &apos;s gun ?
joshua mundy ...
see any difference ?
he was with the girls for the threesome ,
who shot heather while bianca was in the bathroom .
no . why ?
regarding the witness prep , cary , alicia ,
we &apos;re gonna have to delay on the ballistics expert .
why ?
we lost him .
we &apos;re shopping .
okay , that &apos;s everything .
we got court in one hour , so let &apos;s go .
will ?
what &apos;s up ?
this cell phone photo on jenny bauer &apos;s student page ,
it &apos;s different than the one she gave to the police .
there . on this one , that guy &apos;s foot is on the rug ,
and on this one it &apos;s not .
she took another picture ?
only a split second between both shots .
it &apos;s on video .
cell phone video .
find it .
i &apos;ll get that for you .
thanks .
i don &apos;t know if we &apos;re gonna put bianca on the stand yet ,
but if we do ,
are you all right questioning her ?
i &apos;m ... yes .
but i think
cary would do a better job .
why ?
they seem to have bonded .
15 years of doing this and i still can never tell
who &apos;s innocent and who &apos;s guilty .
everybody &apos;s a mystery from the outside ,
including bianca .
we still haven &apos;t had our dinner .
i know .
you worried about peter ?
i &apos;m worried about everything .
i &apos;m not .
all right , all right ,
all right ! everybody , let &apos;s talk one at a time , please .
marisol .
of course he was scuzzy .
i don &apos;t want to marry him . i just believe him .
it was heather &apos;s idea .
heather cross , the victim ?
yeah .
she &apos;s never done a three @-@ way before on zolpidem , and she wanted to .
this was the night before spring break .
yeah @-@ huh .
she came to me downstairs , and she was , like , um ...
do you want me to quote ?
&apos;cause if i quote , i have to use that word .
oh , no , you don &apos;t , mr. mundy , not in my court .
when you feel so inclined ,
you are welcome to use the word &quot; fluff . &quot;
and judy-- delicate flower that she is--
will translate it into its proper form . yes , judy ?
okay . so , um ...
there was , like ...
&quot; do you want to go ... fluff upstairs with bianca on zolpidem ? &quot;
and i was , like ...
it was something she read in the whole tiger woods thing--
zolpidem sex , you know ? relaxed and crazy .
and i was , like , you know ?
no , i don &apos;t know , mr. mundy .
you &apos;ll have to use your words .
i was , like , &quot; sure . &quot;
i mean , um ... &quot; fluff , yeah . &quot;
oh , the joy my life is .
have you got that , judy ?
and you and bianca had been dating ?
yeah .
and she was always kinda freaking out about women ,
so i was surprised that she agreed to go with us .
&quot; freaking out &quot; meaning jealous ?
yes .
then what happened ?
well , we ... fluffed .
and i mean fluffed .
and , uh , i left the two of them
kinda out of it in bianca &apos;s room ,
and i went downstairs to grab a brew .
and that &apos;s when we heard the shot .
and i raced upstairs ,
and i found heather on the floor , you know , like ,
really red with blood and the gun on the floor .
oh , that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re here on another case .
that &apos;s right . we &apos;re ready .
you want to watch ?
oh , well , i @-@ i would ,
but i &apos;m late .
dinner ?
tomorrow night , 8 : 00 p.m. , the westin .
i , uh ,
uh , o @-@ okay .
so , you &apos;d been dating bianca for a while ?
uh , a little while , yeah .
a little while , as in two dates ?
yeah , i guess .
and by &quot; dates , &quot; we mean you slept with her twice ?
yeah .
you have that effect on women ?
they get jealous after two dates ?
objection . argumentative .
sustained , regrettably .
now about this zolpidem that heather and bianca took , you took it , too ?
yeah .
and you know zolpidem is a non @-@ benzodiazepine hypnotic ?
what ?
you can hallucinate on it .
you might also get diarrhea .
well , i ... i didn &apos;t get diarrhea .
good . i &apos;m so glad .
but did you hallucinate ?
no .
it &apos;s also a drug that can cause memory loss .
did you know that ?
no .
in fact , let &apos;s do an experiment .
objection .
you know i like experiments , mr. brody .
overruled .
what color panties was bianca wearing that night ?
what color ? uh ...
white .
well , that is a very good guess , mr. mundy ,
given that 85 % of the panties sold in the u.s. are white .
and yet you &apos;re wrong .
they were black .
see ? that was silly .
men don &apos;t remember things like that .
the color of a woman &apos;s panties ? are you kidding me ?
not at that moment .
and you &apos;re telling me
she &apos;s having sex with her boyfriend , another girl ,
and she &apos;s not jealous ?
well , actually , that was a stretch for me .
i mean , she only slept with the guy twice .
that doesn &apos;t make him a boyfriend .
so are you changing sides ?
now you &apos;re not guilty ?
no . i don &apos;t know .
i just ...
the motive seemed ridiculous .
college today-- a threesome doesn &apos;t mean anything .
i &apos;m getting old .
i &apos;m going back to college .
all right .
i think we should take another vote with our hands .
all those in favor of not guilty ?
seven to five .
now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
i want to know how those voting not guilty can explain the picture .
what i don &apos;t understand , miss bauer ,
is i looked at your student page , and there &apos;s a different shot .
see , this one &apos;s from an earlier frame ,
and this one &apos;s from a later one ...
from your cell phone video .
are you with the cops ?
well , i &apos;ve been assigned to investigate .
i erased it .
the video ?
i don &apos;t believe you .
anyone who brags about helping the police
on their student page isn &apos;t gonna erase anything .
look , i wasn &apos;t trying to hide anything from the police .
i know you weren &apos;t .
it &apos;s just i &apos;d never done it before .
done what ?
okay , tim ,
i do this for you ...
you do this for me .
i was drunk . we were just sexting .
if my parents saw this ...
it &apos;s okay .
we don &apos;t need to tell them .
josh went up before the gunshot .
what ?
josh went up before the gunshot .
he said he went up afterwards .
oh , my god !
we need to get out of here .
who &apos;s josh talking to ?
who &apos;s that ?
i &apos;ve seen him at the gym .
josh is always hanging out with him .
i think he &apos;s on the coaching staff or something .
this guy . who is he ?
oh , ernie suarez , assistant to the athletic director .
does he have a locker here-- ernie ?
yeah , a coach locker , but he hasn &apos;t cleared it out yet .
it &apos;s right there .
you got the keys ?
um , don &apos;t you need a warrant or something ?
yeah , if i were a cop .
i can get bolt cutters in here ,
but it &apos;d be easier if you just opened it .
so you &apos;re not a cop ?
no .
and you &apos;re not with campus police ?
so who are you ?
kalinda .
someone &apos;s been busy .
campus police checked the serial number on the computers .
they &apos;re from a series of 30 campus burglaries over the last year .
good . so the narrative is this :
josh killed heather after she discovered him burglarizing her room .
listen , i &apos;m gonna go catch a ride with campus police
when they go check josh &apos;s room for more stolen goods .
good .
is that our ballistics expert ?
we &apos;ll see . i &apos;m interviewing him now .
god help us .
what &apos;s going on ?
what ?
... is going on ?
will doesn &apos;t even look at you anymore .
he does .
you been a bad girl ?
going now .
in other news ,
sarah palin spoke to party members in texas
as part of her nationwide tour .
palin took aim at the president again over national security .
we need a commander in chief ,
not a professor of law standing at the lectern .
america is ready ...
so , professor , you &apos;re saying this is consistent
with the prosecution witness , josh mundy ,
firing the weapon that killed the victim ?
yes . this is ... yes , i am .
even without evidence of gunshot residue on his hands ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
could you explain ?
well , yes , i , um ...
uh , let &apos;s see , uh ...
here we go .
so the path of the bullet ,
darn it .
the gun was at chest level ,
held by someone as tall as the accused ,
and was shot from three feet away .
the defense ballistic expert--
when he finally got his laser pointer working ...
objection .
withdrawn .
he argued that the gunshot residue found on bianca price &apos;s hands
could have come from her contact with the victim .
does that seem likely to you ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
two experts say the exact opposite thing ,
and they &apos;re both 100 % certain .
so what do we do with that ?
there was this csi : new york ,
where the gun residue
was transferred from one person to another .
they say it happens all the time .
but that &apos;s tv .
yeah , but i &apos;ve heard it some other place .
me , too .
so it &apos;s not impossible .
it &apos;s also weird how little there is , you know , physical evidence .
there &apos;s the gsr .
yeah , but what about the forensic stuff ?
the dna ?
so , wait , you two are changing your minds ?
so , let &apos;s take another vote .
all those in favor of not guilty .
okay , six to six .
yeah , but it &apos;s a different six , so that &apos;s progress .
campus police . coming in .
all right , go ahead , check it out .
anything ?
is your plan just to follow me ?
yep . it &apos;s the only way i can get more from you than you from me .
what &apos;s up ?
josh finishes his threesome , goes downstairs to get a beer
in his shirtsleeves .
where did you get this ?
josh heads back upstairs .
bianca in the bathroom hears the gunshot .
everybody runs up and seconds later , as if by magic ,
josh in his leather jacket .
he &apos;s cold . he puts on a jacket , it happens .
or he uses it to cover the gunshot residue off his hands .
are you writing fiction these days ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
check that for gunshot residue .
where would i go ?
what do you mean ?
what prison ?
dwight correctional center .
is that big ?
i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ve got a really good case .
i know .
just the people at school , they don &apos;t visit .
if my roommate were in prison , i guess i wouldn &apos;t either .
i don &apos;t know .
45 years .
that &apos;s a worst @-@ case scenario .
would you visit me ?
yes .
thank you .
i &apos;m being stupid .
no .
no , you &apos;re not being stupid .
this silently stoic thing--
that &apos;s all just a pose , right ?
when you get home , you start spouting proust ?
yep .
yep .
well , to cowboys .
who knew i loved cowboys ?
maybe it &apos;s in our dna .
part of being american .
you don &apos;t need to talk like that .
i do need to talk like that , because that &apos;s how i talk .
you know , there &apos;s a selfishness to the silence of the cowboy--
forcing everybody else to carry the weight of the conversation .
whew , what am i doing ?
no , i mean , really , what am i doing ?
you &apos;re having dinner .
i mean , you like sarah palin , and i @-@ i ...
i think she &apos;s the devil incarnate .
yep .
and choice--
i mean , how can you be for back alley abortions ?
the murder of 1.2 ...
don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t talk .
stoically silent ?
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t , i &apos;m sorry .
i want to , but i @-@ i can &apos;t .
you have to go ?
i want to stay ,
but 3 generations of democratic ancestors are screaming out in protest .
that &apos;s a lot of generations .
i hope it &apos;s good .
we &apos;re struggling here .
potentially good .
they found gunshot residue on josh &apos;s jacket .
his ... where are you ?
police station .
listen , they found something else on it , too--
heather &apos;s blood .
they &apos;re interrogating josh now .
okay , i &apos;ll have to get a continuance .
you may not have to . the cops are all over this .
look , i &apos;m outside the interrogation room .
phone me when you get something .
i &apos;ll call the troops , we &apos;ll line up the witnesses .
a different ballistics expert .
ahead of you .
what ?
malt ball ?
what happened , burton ?
well , he did burglarize those dorm rooms .
he was actually in league with heather .
they were planning to rob your client .
makes sense .
trying to kill his cohort in crime .
and the lab confirms that is gsr on the jacket and heather &apos;s blood .
okay ...
i &apos;m not seeing how this is bad yet .
well , it &apos;s not-- for me .
the blood and the gsr were on the inside lining of the jacket .
so he wrapped it around his shooting hand .
josh said the jacket was on the floor of the bedroom .
he heard the shot , got into the room ,
grabbed the jacket from between bianca and heather ,
put it on and wore it home .
because he &apos;s guilty .
yes ... of burglary .
i &apos;m not an advocate here , kalinda .
i don &apos;t lie to make things better for a client .
i just look at the facts .
and the facts are against you .
right .
yeah .
oh , sorry , alicia . it &apos;s late , i know .
no , no , no , no , i &apos;m up .
look , we ran into a problem with the narrative .
i think we may need to put bianca on the stand .
i thought kalinda had something .
it didn &apos;t pan out .
do you think you &apos;ll be able to handle questioning her ?
yes .
we &apos;re in a weird place , i know .
it &apos;s okay .
no . i don &apos;t like being in a weird place .
i know .
me neither .
when i look at you during the day ,
i want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
sometimes i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m thinking .
will ...
yeah ?
if it had been differently ...
... at georgetown , if @-@ if it had been us and not peter ,
we would have lasted a week .
no , we wouldn &apos;t have .
we would have .
it &apos;s romantic because it didn &apos;t happen .
if it had happened , it would have just ...
been life .
will don &apos;t say that , please .
i don &apos;t understand .
9mm auto shot 6
they don &apos;t make them anymore &apos; cause they have a hair trigger .
the slightest pressure fires the mechanism .
an accidental firing ?
yeah , but not the one that you &apos;d expect .
the prosecution was correct .
the shot came from three feet away .
the weapon was in the drawer of your client &apos;s bureau .
heather was a thief ,
and when bianca was in the bathroom ,
heather checked the drawer for valuables , money .
oh , my god .
she checked the drawer with the weapon ...
... reached in to take it ,
and ...
you &apos;re kidding .
the shot was fired from three feet away ,
but vertically , not horizontally .
and it was accidentally fired by heather .
there &apos;s no service in here .
and once it was fired ,
the gun fell to the floor .
the problem was there was no blood or gunshot residue below the impact .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t see it .
he took his jacket .
that &apos;s right .
mr. mundy took his leather jacket from the floor ,
and that had the blood and the gsr on it .
you &apos;ll testify to this ?
of course . usual fee .
the problem is , it &apos;s not a good story .
it &apos;s just a freak accident . there are no villains .
but if it &apos;s true ...
but it doesn &apos;t sound true .
the prosecution &apos;s story sounds like the truth--
there &apos;s a villain : bianca , there &apos;s a motive : jealousy .
this story just says there &apos;s no rhyme or reason .
everything &apos;s random .
well , we &apos;re not trying to teach a lesson .
just win a verdict .
there &apos;s another problem .
we &apos;ve already set our story that josh did it .
even our own ballistics expert supported that .
right . we &apos;d have to contradict our own ballistics expert .
well , there &apos;s an another way to settle this :
ask the client .
so that &apos;s what happened ?
that &apos;s what our ballistics expert said happened .
so , i don &apos;t know . do we put this new evidence on the stand or not ?
which is smarter ?
well , that &apos;s up for discussion .
our worry is we tried one defense with the jury ,
and now if we try another , we might do two things :
undercut our credibility
and hurt our chances if the jury was believing our first defense ,
that josh did it .
so what should i do ?
you go with the truth .
the truth has the advantage of being true ,
and on some level , the truth is always more believable .
then that &apos;s what we go with , the truth .
and you believe the gunshot was self @-@ inflicted ?
well , i don &apos;t believe .
the science points there .
the gunshot was accidentally self @-@ inflicted .
thank you , mr. mcveigh .
no problem .
as you said , mr. mcveigh ,
you originally didn &apos;t want to testify in this case ?
yes . i thought miss price was guilty .
right .
then two days ago you had an epiphany ?
well , if by epiphany you mean a new piece of evidence--
this jacket with bloodstain and gsr--
then yes , i did have that .
a change of heart ?
not my choice of words , but i won &apos;t object to &apos; em .
you &apos;re staying at the westin
while you testify in another case ?
yes .
this is a hotel where many prosecutors house their witnesses ?
yes , i believe that &apos;s true .
it &apos;s a hotel where several prosecutors observed you
meeting with another lawyer .
is that a question ?
no .
here &apos;s the question :
two nights ago before you magically changed your mind
about this case , did you have dinner with a partner
from the law firm , stern , lockhart &amp; gardner ?
yes .
objection !
the question &apos;s been answered , mr. gardner .
yes , your honor , i &apos;m sorry , but it was answered too quickly .
well let me overrule just as quickly .
and after this dinner , the partner in question ,
diane lockhart ,
joined you in your hotel room ?
yes .
and did you have sexual relations ?
objection , your honor ! how is this relevant ?
well , i would imagine that mr. brody would say
that the witness &apos;s testimony was bought these alleged sexual relations ,
isn &apos;t that correct , mr. brody ?
it is , your honor .
well , mr. brody , i will sustain mr. gardner &apos;s objections ,
but i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll mind much
because you just threw a stink bomb into the lap of the jury ,
and now you &apos;re running for cover .
your honor , this is an instance ...
and , mr. gardner , yes ,
i see the outrage on your face ,
which i might be more moved by if you hadn &apos;t done
the exact same thing with detective burton &apos;s testimony .
excuse me , your honor , with all dues respect ...
please , your honor ...
no , no , no .
this one we &apos;re calling a draw , gentlemen .
you have both been playing fast and loose
with implications , not facts ,
so we &apos;re gonna try and let justice take care of itself .
you have any more questions , mr. brody ?
no , your honor ,
but we do request a limiting instruction .
members of the jury ,
in weighing mr. mcveigh &apos;s testimony , you may consider any potential bias
in assessing the weight you want to give to what he had to say .
you know , i think it &apos;s almost medieval .
they toss us in here , they lock the door ,
they throw a lot of contradictory evidence at us ,
and then they expect us to come up with a fair decision .
i mean , come on .
so ...
... shall we take another vote ?
i am finished with this conversation.you &apos;re in my office .
you don &apos;t have the courtesy ...
you don &apos;t understand what you did to this firm .
okay , i &apos;m getting out of here .
did it even occur to you to tell me ?
no , it didn &apos;t .
i was under the mistaken impression that it was my life
it &apos;s your life when it doesn &apos;t impact our clients .
it didn &apos;t impact our clients .
diane , the jury ate it up .
it was sex .
it wasn &apos;t gsr or ballistics , it was sex .
i &apos;m going home .
if you had just told me .
if you had just given me a sign !
come on . come on .
don &apos;t be a hypocrite .
a hypocrite ? how am i a hypocrite ?
alicia .
that &apos;s supposed to what , make me quake ,
make me humble ?
make you honest .
there &apos;s nothing going on with alicia .
that &apos;s not true .
it is true .
will ... i have two eyes .
then use them .
watch me .
watch us .
there &apos;s nothing going on with alicia .
turn out the lights .
prosecution &apos;s come in with a last @-@ minute offer :
second @-@ degree murder , ten years .
we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
when the verdict comes in , the offer goes away .
you &apos;d be 34 years old , baby .
you &apos;d still ...
you &apos;d still have a life .
but if they find you guilty ...
45 years , no parole .
2055 . i @-@ i ...
what do you think ?
i think you didn &apos;t do it ...
and the jury will see that .
really ?
yes .
you only need one juror .
yes , but if you &apos;re wrong , you &apos;ll go back to work ,
and i watch my daught ...
oh , my god , i can &apos;t do this .
i know .
can you give us a minute ?
mom ...
it &apos;s gonna be okay . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
listen , listen , they were just arguing the opposite !
which they &apos;re allowed to .
they &apos;re the defense .
but two ballistic experts , one saying one thing ,
the other saying ...
they &apos;re the defense .
the whole point is to poke holes in the prosecution &apos;s case .
yes , but this ballistics expert said
two days ago he thought one thing , now he &apos;s thinking another--
right ! and what if in three days more he thinks something else ?
hey , doc ,
you look depleted .
i guess i am .
i don &apos;t know .
i sit here listening to everybody talk ,
and i just feel like we weren &apos;t given enough information .
so what do we do ?
do you have reasonable doubt ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just have ...
reasonable ignorance .
kalinda , we &apos;ve got a problem .
the bailiff &apos;s warning that the verdict &apos;s coming in .
okay .
bianca and her mother want to talk to us .
oh , no .
yep . where &apos;s cary ? we need cary .
why ?
she likes him . maybe he can talk to her .
okay .
okay ...
we &apos;re unanimous .
oh ! yes !
finally . good job .
democracy in action .
all for $ 15 a day .
i bet a lot of jurors trade numbers and say they &apos;ll stay in touch .
but i bet nobody does .
why don &apos;t we just save time and not trade numbers ?
hello , judge .
i thought i &apos;d just join you in here and thank you for your service .
unfortunately , i now need to excuse you and thank you for your service .
what did we do ?
nothing .
you did your job well .
this happens sometimes ,
and there &apos;s no way to prepare for it .
the prosecution and defense have agreed to a plea bargain just seconds ago .
you &apos;re kidding me ?
no , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not .
this happens sometimes
when one side or the other worries about the outcome .
so again , thank you .
i hope this doesn &apos;t diminish your enthusiasm for the court system
because in another year you &apos;re gonna get another summons .
so what happened ?
what was the plea bargain ?
oh . miss price agreed to a charge of second @-@ degree murder .
ten years .
thanks again .
