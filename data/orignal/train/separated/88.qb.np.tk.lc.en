lemond bishop , you &apos;re under arrest for murder .
it &apos;s not about your drug business .
it &apos;s about your legit businesses .
a confidential informant ?
yeah , you &apos;re accused of killing a confidential informant
at one of your health clubs .
all those opposed ?
the proposal passes .
next on the agenda , will ...
i ask for a show of hands to formalize
the appointment of equity partner , alicia florrick ,
to the steering committee .
all those in favor ?
great , welcome , alicia .
i think you have an agenda .
i do , thank you .
can we talk about money now ?
yes .
david proposes reacquiring the 27th and the 29th floors .
it &apos;s time we look like a real law firm again
and not some burmese tent city .
i would only argue that we not make the same mistake
we made at the beginning of the downturn .
we overspent and regretted it .
yes , but in my opinion we &apos;re living in a new economy
and there &apos;s as much danger of us
being too conservative with our finances .
and what might be the danger of being too conservative ?
oh , no , mommy and daddy are fighting .
look , we &apos;re one of the few all @-@ service firms left standing ,
and if we don &apos;t expand ,
our clients will leave us for someone who will .
but they haven &apos;t up to this point .
because the economy has scared them .
okay , no more speeches .
i propose we lease back the 27th and the 29th floor
before they &apos;re snatched up .
and i propose that if this motion fails ,
we study the economic impact in a subcommittee .
oh , yes , by all means ,
form another subcommittee .
everyone in favor of david lee &apos;s proposal ,
please raise their hands .
come on , debbie ,
stop sucking up to diane .
all those opposed ?
all right , six for and six against .
you are kidding me .
will , do you mind heading up the subcommittee
to study the economic impact of leasing these new floors ?
i don &apos;t mind .
good .
so , one more matter :
there seems to be some concern about our investigator .
with the influx of new business ,
there &apos;s a feeling that she is being overtaxed .
i propose we hire a new investigator .
to work with kalinda ?
i don &apos;t care , i just want it done .
yes , someone to work with kalinda .
when we hired a second investigator a few years ago ,
it didn &apos;t work out so well .
oh , my god , she &apos;s right .
what were we thinking ?
well , i think we can find a better fit than blake .
all those in favor of hiring a second investigator ?
yes , be brave , lone voice in the wilderness .
good , i will form a subcommittee for hiring , and with that ...
no new business , i &apos;m out of here .
diane .
could i be on that subcommittee ?
well , i know you &apos;re friends with kalinda
but you &apos;re an equity partner now .
your loyalty has to be with the firm .
i know .
you cannot tell her anything .
i know .
confidentiality rules .
but certainly you can join the subcommittee .
thank you .
i think you &apos;re late for court , aren &apos;t you ?
alicia .
liz ?
yeah , yeah .
i haven &apos;t seen you since school .
look at you , you look exactly the same .
so do you , wow .
and , uh , we &apos;re on opposite sides again ,
just like school .
good guys , bad guys .
all right , i &apos;ll , uh , see you inside .
okay .
who &apos;s that ?
liz lawrence .
my nemesis in law school .
is she good ?
yes .
mr. bishop &apos;s comfort level
should not be our concern , your honor .
this is not about our client &apos;s comfort level , your honor .
this is about his eight @-@ year @-@ old son
who he has not seen since his arrest .
then , mr. bishop shouldn &apos;t have killed
one of our confidential informants .
excuse me , mr. bishop did not kill anyone .
we have evidence that the
confidential informant &apos;s boyfriend , noah ,
physically abused her on dozens of occasions .
and where is this evidence ?
we &apos;ve been hearing about this boyfriend for months now .
we are prepared to present this evidence , your honor .
but once again the ausa is simply attempting
to punish our client ...
mrs. florrick is misinformed .
i &apos;m attempting to prevent their client from fleeing .
thank you , counselors .
counselors .
. . bishop will be remanded into the custody of a u.s. marshal
and permitted to visit his son
outside of prison two hours every week .
even in law school , i always let you win one .
oh , is that what that was ?
kalinda found the ci &apos;s boyfriend , noah .
good .
what did he say ?
she found him in the morgue .
he heard the police were looking for him
and shot himself in the head .
did he leave a suicide note ?
she &apos;s checking .
we can still point to him as the most likely suspect .
we have the police reports on noah &apos;s abusiveness .
and we have witnesses who saw him fleeing the murder .
yeah , but the boyfriend &apos;s dead .
hey , dad ,
watch this .
derrick rose better watch his back .
judy , could you give me a second with mrs. florrick ?
uh , sure .
do you need anything ?
no , i &apos;m good . thanks , sis .
look , this isn &apos;t over .
we still have the testimony backing up your alibi .
my sister &apos;s testimony , yeah .
they &apos;ll think she &apos;s lying to protect me .
they want to get me .
there &apos;s a lawyer i know .
charles lester .
i want you to take him with you .
mr. bishop , if you &apos;re unhappy
with your representation ...
stop it .
what i want is for you to work with charles lester .
dad , come on .
can you believe it ?
they might convict me for the one thing i didn &apos;t do .
need something to do ?
no , i seem to have a subcommittee to head up .
it &apos;s nice of you to volunteer .
actually , i think i was volunteered .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re six to six .
looking into the economic impact .
no , you &apos;re filibustering .
we escaped the executioner , will .
now that we have some reserves ,
why are we so anxious to spend them ?
because we need to grow .
we need to hire and add offices .
and end up right where we started ?
no , you were the one who wanted to open an office
in new york and go after canning &apos;s firm .
yes , i was angry .
well , get angry again .
we are responsible for 300 employees .
we aren &apos;t rebels , we &apos;re not gamblers .
wait .
what ?
stern said that when you have a partnership disagreement ,
you look at your mission statement .
what mission statement ?
exactly .
you guys are great .
just keep it up .
cheers .
cheers .
that &apos;s the ci , christina diaz ,
three months before she was murdered .
the one bishop said he never met .
things just keep getting worse .
where &apos;d you find it ?
one of the gym workers .
they were having a celebration
for the most membership sales . he taped it .
do the feds know about it ?
the tape ? no , not yet .
we can &apos;t destroy it .
i know , but we don &apos;t need to tell them
that it exists .
this is just a copy .
yeah , they &apos;ll just find it anyway , won &apos;t they ?
well , sometimes they &apos;re not as good at their jobs .
yeah .
okay .
need to go meet our new cocounsel .
cocounsel ?
someone bishop wants us to use .
you heard ?
yes , charles lester is here .
this should be interesting .
what does mr. bishop &apos;s personal lawyer look like ?
yeah .
mr. lester .
yes .
mr. charles lester ?
yes .
and you &apos;re ...
alicia florrick .
and cary agos .
yes .
well , you &apos;re not at all what i expected .
really ?
no , you both look much younger .
oh , well , that &apos;s nice .
should we get going on these witness interviews ?
yes , i think first we &apos;re going to go and see , um ...
ike kramer .
uh , no , i @-@ i ...
don &apos;t you hate it when you write something down
on a piece of paper and then ...
oh , thanks .
ike kramer .
he &apos;s a , uh , trainer at , uh ,
one of mr. bishop &apos;s gymnasiums .
oh , good , so you have the address ?
yes , i do .
it &apos;s , um ...
it &apos;s over on , um ...
i already talked to the feds .
yeah , we know . just , just tell us what you told them .
look , i &apos;m not trying to hurt mr. bishop ,
i &apos;m just trying to tell the truth .
he had us in a meeting .
he told us that if he caught anyone skimming ,
he would kill them .
those were his exact words ?
he would kill them ?
not get rid of in the sense of fire ?
no , look , we all knew christina was skimming .
bishop didn &apos;t know she was a ci .
none of us did .
but i think he killed her
because she was skimming .
couldn &apos;t he have been using the work jokingly ?
well , no one laughed .
i mean , i like mr. bishop a lot ,
but he has a ...
serious side .
okay .
mr. lester , do you have any questions ?
uh , yes .
uh , just a second .
there we go .
what are the hours here ?
8 : 00 a.m. to 10 : 00 p.m.
8 : 00 to 10 : 00-- that &apos;s pretty standard ?
yes .
and what is that ?
that over there .
it &apos;s a chart about body weight .
really , and you &apos;re interested in body weight ?
yes ... i ... am .
okay , good .
that &apos;s it for me .
that &apos;s-- no more questions ?
uh , no .
we have a problem .
we &apos;d rather keep this confidential .
you know our client , seth de luca ?
the restaurateur ?
exactly .
he was one of stern &apos;s first clients .
eight years with us .
okay , what &apos;s wrong ?
he paid his bill on time .
in full ?
down to the cent .
you think he &apos;s leaving ?
that &apos;s the worry .
just check and see if he &apos;s meeting other firms .
we don &apos;t want to lose old clients
while we &apos;re pursuing new ones .
i &apos;m on it .
you saw , uh ,
thao , crowne &amp; associates went bankrupt ?
yeah , i did .
any friends there out of work ?
a few-- two investigators .
why ?
oh , no reason .
thank you .
your honor , this is merely a preliminary hearing .
if there isn &apos;t enough evidence ,
mr. bishop should be free .
the defense is trying to get two cracks at bat :
here , during this hearing ,
and then again during trial .
your honor ,
the prosecution is shirking ...
let them cross @-@ examine
during the trial .
... its responsibilities .
they will have plenty of time ...
counsel ... counselors !
question your witness , ms. lawrence .
show me there &apos;s enough to prosecute .
thank you , your honor .
mr. kramer , thank you for making yourself available .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re gonna lose here ,
but it will prepare us for trial , okay ?
you work at mr. bishop &apos;s gym
fine fitness ?
yes , i &apos;m a trainer there .
now , mr. kramer ,
you heard mr. bishop make a pronouncement
about skimming in one of his meetings , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah .
and what was that pronouncement ?
that he wouldn &apos;t tolerate anybody skimming .
and didn &apos;t he say that he would murder anybody caught skimming ?
no .
i ...
he didn &apos;t ?
i &apos;m sorry .
did he say that he would kill anybody caught skimming ?
no .
you told our investigators he did .
no .
i said mr. bishop said
that he would &quot; get rid of &quot; anybody he caught skimming .
and by that he meant &quot; kill . &quot;
no . he meant &quot; fire . &quot;
uh , your honor , uh ...
we need some time to discuss this .
sure , but we immediately request
a dismissal , your honor .
your honor , the witness is changing his tune ...
absent that , we ask for bail .
there isn &apos;t enough sufficient evidence ...
please , that &apos;s enough .
so what happened there ?
witness recanted .
yes ...
but why ?
oh , i have no idea .
maybe we intimidated him .
i mean , who else ? it was just us .
hi .
say , could i take a gander at
the other evidence against mr. bishop ?
i heard there was a videotape
that could be a bit damaging .
22 years on the force , got my pension .
since then i &apos;ve been doing freelance investigative work .
thank you , sergeant .
please ... walt .
good old walt .
walt .
and so you &apos;re currently ready to work ?
am i currently ready ? yeah .
i got my coffee thermos right here .
any more questions ?
yes . um , walt , do you have much experience working with women ?
oh , sure .
and how do you feel about working with a female investigator ?
no complaints here .
i love the ladies ,
and the ladies love me .
sergeant wilkins ,
they &apos;re almost ready for you .
am i being replaced ?
no .
there are three ex @-@ cops in reception .
really ?
and how do you know they &apos;re ex @-@ cops ?
you &apos;re not being replaced .
you &apos;re interviewing investigators .
why would you be interviewing investigators ,
unless you want a second one ?
yes .
we &apos;re expanding your department .
my department ?
yes .
you &apos;re a department now .
congratulations .
the office of legal investigators .
i don &apos;t have a desk but i have a department ?
we &apos;ll get you a desk .
and how you doing with our wayward restaurateur ?
any reason why he paid on time ?
so this other investigator ...
the second investigator .
he &apos;ll work under me ?
not necessarily .
so you &apos;re expanding my department ,
but i &apos;m not the head of my department ?
basically .
will , i should be in there
interviewing the second investigator .
the first investigator
should be in there interviewing the second .
this is a partner @-@ level decision .
yeah . which partners ?
diane , rick ,
bob from litigation ,
alicia .
yes .
your back is covered .
this is a good thing , kalinda .
more work , more money ,
more prestige .
you know , somehow , when people say &quot; more prestige , &quot;
they usually mean &quot; less power . &quot;
check on chef de luca !
is he leaving us ?
look , i &apos;m from lockhart / gardner ,
and i &apos;m here to make sure that you &apos;re happy .
needs more cheese .
you paid your bill in full , on time .
that usually suggests that a client is leaving .
i &apos;m fine .
good .
because we &apos;re offering clients
a five @-@ percent discount on services
in exchange for a retainer .
lately your firm has stopped making me feel ...
special .
okay . so ...
how can we make you feel special again ?
in my experience
the larger the firm ,
the harder it is to change their behavior .
it &apos;s not about teaching an old dog new tricks ,
it &apos;s about teaching a big dog .
so you &apos;re considering using a smaller dog .
might you tell me
which dog you &apos;re speaking with ?
sure .
it &apos;s one of your lawyers .
trying to convince me to jump ship with him .
which of our lawyers ?
i ... no .
you &apos;ll just get him fired .
no . i won &apos;t .
well , don &apos;t you think it &apos;s fair
you tell us who we &apos;re competing with ?
someone who &apos;s good on my cases .
that &apos;s all i &apos;ll say .
cary agos ?
that &apos;s all i ll say .
but it is cary agos ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
i looked into your background , mr. lester .
that sounds dramatic .
you &apos;ve been a lawyer for 25 years ,
but you &apos;ve never tried a single case .
well , i don &apos;t like court .
you &apos;ve never written one brief .
none that i could find , anyway .
i don &apos;t like putting things in writing .
you don &apos;t have a firm , and from what i can tell ,
you don &apos;t have an office either .
well , i like working from home .
you &apos;ve had one client for the last ten years :
lemond bishop .
and before that , you had one client for 12 years .
anthony grozzi , until he was murdered in 2003 .
guilty .
so what exactly ...
do you do ?
i have only one client because
i don &apos;t like to work very much .
i like working at home
because i like spending time with my wife .
what i do for mr. bishop is ...
i offer dedicated service .
i update him ,
i keep an eye out for problems ,
and when i think things are going wrong , i tell him .
i &apos;m a small @-@ town lawyer
with a small @-@ time practice .
like abraham lincoln .
this case is winnable , mr. lester .
i didn &apos;t say it wasn &apos;t .
mr. bishop didn &apos;t do it .
he &apos;s innocent , and i can prove it .
good .
that &apos;s all he wants .
thanks for meeting me here . sorry , i ...
i get the kids once a week .
i &apos;m gonna say to you the same thing i said to the prosecutor ,
so i don &apos;t know what you need to know .
i work for mr. bishop at a club that he owns ,
and i saw him getting into a tan honda
the night that the victim disappeared .
was it this car ?
look , like i said ,
i didn &apos;t see him kill anyone , all right ?
i just saw him get into that car .
her body was found in this car .
yeah , i know .
okay , thanks .
how old are your kids ?
five and seven .
i remember when my daughters were that age .
it &apos;s a lot of fun until they turn 13 .
and then ... watch out .
his kids were cute .
that &apos;s why i asked him how old they were .
didn &apos;t you think they were cute ?
yes .
you thought i was , what , implying some kind of threat ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , he didn &apos;t change his testimony , so ...
i must not be very effective .
&quot; lockhart / gardner
is an all @-@ service law firm intent on ... &quot;
&quot; intent on &quot; sounds odd .
&quot; dedicated to . &quot;
&quot; dedicated to ...
&quot; offering our clients the best ...
legal and professional services available ... &quot;
great , diane , that means nothing .
who doesn &apos;t want to give their clients the best service ?
then ... what do you want it to say ?
&quot; lockhart / gardner wants it all .
we want to be the biggest and the best . &quot;
what ?
can we just have a moment when we &apos;re not struggling ?
please ? can we just take a breath ?
we did take a breath .
no , we didn &apos;t .
well , then go ahead and take a vacation , and i &apos;ll do this .
what ?
i just have to make some calls .
diane , wait .
you weren &apos;t the one paying the bills , will .
you weren &apos;t the one trying to delay our creditors .
i can &apos;t go back to that .
my guess is , i @-@ i thought i saw mr. bishop
getting into the car , but ...
but you were under the influence of oxycodone ?
yeah .
your honor , i ...
this is ...
i am very distressed by this .
as am i.
this is where i &apos;d ask for a dismissal .
as you can see , your honor ,
the government does not have the testimony to support their case ...
what we have , your honor , is the testimony
of his health club manager , plus we have new evidence--
we have a videotape
that shows mr. bishop at a social gathering with the victim .
your honor , none of this is sufficient to warrant the indictment ...
perhaps mrs. florrick has forgotten ,
but the purpose of a preliminary hearing is
to determine whether probable cause exists .
agreed , and i find the affidavit
of the health club manager , mr. dexter roja ,
quite persuasive . i &apos;ll hear his testimony .
bishop is using you to intimidate these witnesses .
oh , come on .
every single time you question one , they recant .
have you ever thought that you
might &apos;ve intimidated these witnesses to get them to testify ?
you know , we used to feel bad for you .
the old gang from school .
we all called each other
after your press conference and said ,
&quot; can you believe it ,
having your husband admit to sleeping with prostitutes ? &quot;
now i see .
you were made for each other .
do you know what i &apos;ve thought of you since school ?
what ?
nothing .
so , you want to check out this videotape ?
yes , i think we should .
well , the problem is dexter roja .
we &apos;re interviewing him next .
you and ...
lester both ?
yes .
mrs. florrick and i are becoming quite the team .
good .
mrs. florrick , if you don &apos;t mind ,
charles and i have another matter to discuss .
if it has to do with the case , i should ...
no , it &apos;s another matter .
it will just take a minute .
okay .
what happens if this dexter guy
can &apos;t supply any information to help the feds ?
our hope is , either they drop the charges
or the judge grants a motion to dismiss .
ma &apos;am , there &apos;s a call for you .
are you sure ?
yes .
mrs. florrick ?
we &apos;re driving home ,
and i turn to my son in the backseat ,
and that &apos;s when i noticed a black escalade following us .
and at home i pointed it out to my husband .
and as soon as he stepped outside ,
it skidded away .
now , apparently ,
mr. bishop is no longer content with just intimidating witnesses .
excuse me , your honor ,
but that is an appalling accusation .
then what happened ?
so , then my son tells me that a man approached him
at his preschool and he was asking him about his mommy .
about what time she was coming to pick him up
and when his birthday was .
his birthday ?
yes . and then he asked him what he wanted for his birthday .
and when my son started to walk away , the man said that
&quot; maybe your mommy was working too hard
to be there for your birthday . &quot;
you gave the police a description ?
yes .
and the department of justice is offering you security
for your son and yourself ?
yes , yes , your honor .
but that @-@ that @-@ that &apos;s not the issue here !
i know . thank you .
i ... mrs. florrick , to your knowledge ,
has anyone from mr. bishop &apos;s organization
attempted to intimidate the ausa &apos;s family ?
no , your honor .
of course she doesn &apos;t know .
mrs. florrick , to your knowledge ,
has anyone from mr. bishop &apos;s
organization intimidated witnesses ?
not to my knowledge .
this is a lie !
excuse me , your honor ,
i am appalled by what happened to ms. lawrence .
thanks .
but we have no proof that
my client had anything to do with this .
what other cases is ms. lawrence pursuing ?
oh , come on ! you are a mother !
i mean , what if this happened to your kids ?
okay ... intimidating witnesses is a disbarrable offense .
you know that . it &apos;s also illegal .
i &apos;m not saying it happened .
i &apos;m not saying anything other than :
if you have any knowledge
of any such intimidation , or if you so much as wink at it ,
you are subject to arrest .
do you understand that ?
i do understand that .
good . then everyone can go .
thank you .
when did you sell your soul ?
okay , um , i was supposed to come in earlier this morning ,
but your human resources people called and they canceled ;
and then they called me back and they said ,
&quot; come in right now . &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m not dressed . &quot;
&apos;cause i was babysitting for my sister &apos;s kids .
this , uh , that &apos;s not baby vomit , by the way .
um , i usually , i dress pretty nice .
um , more like a college student , you know ?
and you were a treasury enforcement agent ?
two years . i liked it .
people were really nice .
um , but , you know , it &apos;s a bit stiff .
the thing is , ms. burdine ,
uh , we have a particular tone here .
i can do tone . i have a much better tone .
uh , maybe i should come back tomorrow better dressed .
do you usually work alone or with someone else ?
oh , we usually worked solo .
but if you want me to work with someone ,
i can do that . i &apos;m good . i &apos;m there .
a bachelor &apos;s in criminal justice from the university of illinois
and a minor in dance ?
yeah . ballet .
oh , my parents they threw a fit .
um , they are reformed hippies .
eight kids in an rv .
uh , but i liked the criminal justice thing anyway .
i like to figure out why people do bad things .
are you serious ?
look at her resume .
the treasury put her on tracking terrorist financing .
yes , when they took her off of it ...
no , she quit .
and that &apos;s a good thing ?
look , i know she &apos;s a different choice ,
kalinda was a different choice .
there were five ex @-@ cops out in that reception ,
and one kalinda . you remember ?
i see . so this is about kalinda .
you two are arguing for her
because you know she won &apos;t challenge kalinda ?
no . i think investigators work best
when you don &apos;t see them coming .
when they walk into your business
and they look like a babysitter and not an ex @-@ cop .
i am arguing for her because she won &apos;t challenge kalinda .
they &apos;re more likely to work well together .
that &apos;s a good thing .
take her on for a month .
let kalinda train her . if we don &apos;t like the results ,
we &apos;ll go with one of the sergeants .
did you have someone threaten liz lawrence ?
did ... ? who &apos;s that ?
liz lawrence . our opponent .
the ausa ?
did you have someone follow her kid to school
and threaten her family ?
i thought you didn &apos;t like her .
i don &apos;t . did you have someone threaten her family ?
no .
i won &apos;t stand for it , mr. lester .
well , good for you !
i said no .
we don &apos;t need to play a tough guy &apos;s game .
there are other ways to win this .
mrs. florrick , i &apos;m not sure
how many other ways there are to say this !
i haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
i read up on your work with the grozzi family .
deaths and assassinations
all after you joined the defense team .
really ?
and i &apos;ve read up on your work with colin sweeney .
another woman dead after you joined his team .
defense attorneys are in the business
of being misunderstood , mrs. florrick .
you should know that .
i &apos;d like to handle dexter &apos;s interview alone .
i don &apos;t think that would be wise .
mr. bishop ...
is my client , not yours .
he &apos;s advised you to bring me along .
are you saying i don &apos;t have an option ?
i &apos;m saying he &apos;s advised you to bring me along , that &apos;s all .
let &apos;s be friends .
look , bishop is my boy .
i don &apos;t want to testify against him ,
but i don &apos;t have a choice .
so the ausa is pressuring you to testify ?
they found my dna on christina &apos;s body .
under her fingernails .
strange they &apos;re not going after you for the murder .
they agreed , in exchange for my testimony ,
they wouldn &apos;t prosecute me .
they said that they found your dna under her fingernails ?
and i don &apos;t know how it happened .
we were sleeping together .
i didn &apos;t kill her .
it &apos;s true . seth de luca is thinking of leaving us .
that &apos;s why he paid his bill in full .
do we know who else is in the mix for his business ?
uh , he didn &apos;t say .
he didn &apos;t say , but you can guess ?
no .
but you asked ?
yeah .
and what did he say ?
uh , he didn &apos;t say .
kalinda , what am i missing here ?
well , he &apos;s looking into small start @-@ up firms .
one @-@ man firms . that &apos;s all .
but what firms ?
john michaels closed shop . who else is out there ?
is it one of our lawyers ? someone from our staff ?
no .
okay , let &apos;s give him a call . thanks .
oh , one more thing , kalinda .
we have some good news .
i know you &apos;ve been stretched a little thin lately .
we thought adding another investigator could help .
her name &apos;s robyn burdine .
she &apos;s from the treasury .
very young , very green .
she &apos;s never worked at a law firm before .
we &apos;d like you to train her .
train her ?
uh , yes .
in what ?
what you do .
if you &apos;re up for it .
and if i &apos;m not ?
well , unfortunately , the firm is growing .
uh , we need more hands on deck , so ...
we &apos;re asking you as a favor .
okay .
why does everything feel like we &apos;re pulling teeth here ?
the family &apos;s growing .
* as long as we got each other *
* we got the world spinning right in our hands *
oh , dear god .
growing pains .
* the luckiest dreamers who never quit dreaming *
* as long as we keep on ... *
you &apos;re kalinda ?
yep .
hi . robyn .
hi .
i know , i can &apos;t believe they hired me either .
you were a treasury agent ?
yeah . people here sure must have a lot of money for clothes .
i &apos;ve never seen clothes like this .
okay , so the ausa is claiming
dexter &apos;s skin cells were found .
hello .
hi . um , robyn burdine .
i &apos;m the other investigator .
really ?
the other investigator ?
what do you need , cary ?
uh ... what was i saying ?
uh , the ausa is claiming that dexter &apos;s skin cells were ...
yes .
dexter &apos;s skin cells were found
underneath the victim &apos;s nails ,
and the ausa is using that
as a way to intimidate dexter into testifying .
so we &apos;re looking for a way to knock it out .
okay .
you have a sidekick now ? batman .
you need to cool it .
need to cool what ?
will and diane asked me to find out
if our client seth de luca was pursuing another firm .
you talked to seth ?
i did . and he said that you solicited him .
i didn &apos;t go out of my way to solicit him .
he was complaining about overbilling .
yeah , but you mentioned you
were going out on your own .
might be going out on my own .
cary , if they find out ,
they &apos;ll fire you .
did you tell them ?
no .
you didn &apos;t ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
thank you .
don &apos;t do it again .
i &apos;m serious .
tell me what you &apos;re looking for , and i &apos;ll help .
look ...
oh ... just ... huh .
let &apos;s just keep our huhs to ourselves , okay ?
okay .
denatonium .
what about it ?
it &apos;s in her system-- it &apos;s a bittering agent .
was she poisoned ?
no . shot .
there &apos;s not enough here to be poisoned , anyway .
what ?
nail @-@ biting .
nail @-@ biting ?
yeah , that makes sense--
lots of women put denatonium on their nails to keep from biting .
your honor , this is coercion , pure and simple .
give me a break .
the medical examiner confirmed that skin cells were never collected
from underneath the victim &apos;s fingernails ,
because there were no fingernails .
there were no fingernails ?
the victim was a nail @-@ biter .
your honor , this report is the height of irrelevancy .
no , this report means the ausa threatened the witness .
your honor ...
she threatened dexter roja with information she knew
to be false in order to coerce him into testifying .
your honor , this defense is based on smears .
dexter roja is one of mr. bishop &apos;s lieutenants ...
health club managers .
his testimony is vital to our case .
yes , but ms.-ms. lawrence has accused us of intimidating witnesses .
shouldn &apos;t she be held to the same standard ?
yes , she should .
threatening a witness with lies in order to get him to testify
leaves me with no other choice but to exclude said testimony .
unless you have any other witnesses ,
i am going to be forced to dismiss .
your honor , the government disagrees
with your characterization of our actions ,
but we do have one more witness that we would like to call .
a witness who will question mr. bishop &apos;s alibi .
we would like to amend the witness list to include judy bishop ,
the sister of the accused .
judy ?
please don &apos;t speak to our witness .
judy , this is wrong .
now what ?
i have no idea .
my brother asked me to babysit dylan .
he said he would only be out for a few hours .
and this was the night of october 24 ?
the night that christina diaz was killed ?
yes .
mr. bishop claims that
he returned home from his horse farm around 9 : 00 p.m. that night .
is that your recollection ?
no .
he didn &apos;t return home until just before midnight .
and what was mr. bishop &apos;s temperament when he got home ?
uh , agitated .
a little nervous .
he took a shower right away .
and then you left ?
he asked me how to use the washer first .
guess he never learned how . never had to .
she &apos;s lying . she wants custody of dylan .
and what did he need to wash so urgently ?
the clothes he was wearing .
trying to get rid of evidence ?
objection , your honor .
sustained .
no further questions .
judy , two years ago ,
when your brother was getting a divorce ,
you wrote a character reference letter .
in which you called him honorable and a wonderful father .
that was before i knew everything he was involved in .
i didn &apos;t want to believe the rumors .
i see . and what made you believe the rumors ?
a young woman was shot to death .
if he had a hand in it , then he needs to be punished .
you love your nephew very much ,
don &apos;t you ?
like he &apos;s my own son . yes .
and as his guardian ,
you would be petitioning for full custody
if mr. bishop was found guilty .
objection . how is this relevant ?
your honor , this quid pro quo
makes this witness unreliable .
she will say anything in order to gain custody .
i only want what &apos;s best for dylan .
that &apos;s all .
you are hurting dylan .
don &apos;t you see that ?
your honor , mr. bishop no longer has an alibi
for the time of the murder ,
which we know , based on lividity ,
happened between the hours of 9 : 00 p.m. and 11 : 00 p.m.
on the night of the 24th .
she &apos;s gonna decide against us .
um , your honor ,
given the last minute addition to the witness list ,
we ask for a recess to prepare a rebuttal .
so , how you want to handle this ?
you want me to just watch ?
yeah ?
what do you need ?
hi , uh , just a few questions .
we &apos;re from bishop &apos;s law firm .
yeah ?
is he gonna get out ?
well , we &apos;re working on it .
look , mr. bishop claims that he was here
arount 9 : 00 p.m. on the night
of the murder , october the 24th .
is there a chance anyone might have seen him ?
nah , we &apos;re all long gone by 6 : 00 p.m.
okay , well , i see you have security cameras .
is there a chance
they might have caught something ?
no . they weren &apos;t on the night of the 24th .
feds already tried to confiscate them .
someone manually turned them off ?
not sure .
sometimes a storm will knock &apos; em out .
uh , that gate , does it open and close
every time someone comes and goes ?
yeah .
and that &apos;s the only way on and off the property ?
we asked our investigators to look into your alibi .
you said you were alone at the horse farm
at the time of the murder ?
yes .
the electronic log at the farm ,
it shows that someone
was buzzed in from inside the corral
at 8 : 32 p.m.
okay .
you let someone in ?
if you did , you need to tell us .
whoever you let in can alibi you .
mr. bishop ,
please , we need to use this person .
i had a meeting .
a meeting you didn &apos;t want caught on camera ?
some associates .
from another ... organization .
will they corroborate your alibi ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i can &apos;t admit on the stand that i was meeting with them .
it &apos;s the only way to
refute your sister &apos;s testimony .
no .
i &apos;ll lose dylan .
you &apos;ll have the best family law attorney in chicago .
and what ? supervised visitation
every other saturday ?
we can roll the dice and go to trial .
but your sister &apos;s testimony will be damaging .
what do you think ?
i think you know
what you have to do .
good work on that horse farm .
i think it might turn things around .
and , uh ...
talked to seth de luca .
he &apos;s not going to say anything to will and diane , so ...
good .
yeah .
thanks for that .
warning me .
ah , it &apos;s all in a day &apos;s work .
no .
it wasn &apos;t .
wasn &apos;t in a day &apos;s work .
okay ...
cary , what do you want ?
no .
why ?
because you want more ,
and i can &apos;t give you more .
because of women ?
no .
because we work together ?
yeah .
well , i &apos;m thinking of leaving , so ...
well , then , say something nice .
you look great .
the way that your hair hangs ...
all right .
what ?
just said , &quot; hey . &quot;
any word on bishop ?
not yet .
alicia &apos;s heading out to court .
okay .
that &apos;s that .
hello , judy .
you mind if i come in ?
please , no more mission statements .
what are we toasting ?
we never celebrated .
when things go right ,
you need to celebrate .
but what are we celebrating ?
we came back from the dead .
to beating bankruptcy .
beating bankruptcy .
we were wound up for so long ,
we never unwound .
we breezed right through winning .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s for you .
it &apos;s from the 27th floor .
i saved it from the dumpster .
it was so close , wasn &apos;t it ?
the end .
our careers in ruin .
yes .
i don &apos;t want that to happen again .
i know . it won &apos;t .
we &apos;re smarter now , we &apos;re better at it .
i don &apos;t know if that matters .
it does .
okay , i &apos;ll change my vote .
good .
you &apos;re supposed to say , &quot; you don &apos;t have to . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to .
but i &apos;m glad you did .
well ...
mrs. florrick .
how do you manage to look so refreshed
after an all @-@ nighter ?
i knew if i dug deep enough ,
i &apos;d find precedents to get judy &apos;s testimony kicked .
and did you ?
usa v. east .
when a prosecutor offers aid
to a witness in a civil trial
as a quid pro quo for testimony ...
it &apos;s okay .
you sold me .
time to knock liz &apos;s teeth out .
all rise .
your honor , i know the ausa has not yet arrived ,
but i have prepared a brief in support of my motion
to exclude judy bishop &apos;s testimony .
that won &apos;t be necessary , mrs. florrick .
uh , but , your honor ...
ms. bishop has withdrawn her testimony .
and , given the government &apos;s lack of evidence and witnesses ,
i am releasing you , mr. bishop .
yes !
* cindy , cindy where have you gone ? *
* you wore your lipstick just to tell me good @-@ bye *
* and i &apos;m blue , blue , blue without you *
