the good wife s01e05
an hour ago , i resigned the state &apos;s attorney of cook county .
dad told us he made mistakes .
yeah , but not that .
who first told you of your husband &apos;s infidelity , mrs. florrick ?
cnbc . i saw it on the crawl at the bottom of the screen .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re making a life for yourself .
it gives you a break .
well , i just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity .
it &apos;s a real lifesaver .
no . glad you could come aboard .
looks like we share an assistant ,
so tell me when i &apos;m hogging her , okay ?
and let the best man win .
you told him peter was lonely in prison .
because he is .
just don &apos;t go around me by talking to my kids .
jackie , it &apos;ll just have to wait until next week .
but peter &apos;s expecting them for his birthday .
peter and i agreed i &apos;d bring the kids next week .
their first visit is a big deal . i want to do it right .
and so , you need me for how many nights late ?
just a couple , and i shouldn &apos;t be too late ...
11 : 00 or so .
what do you want me to tell zach and grace ?
tell them i love them , and i will call them tonight .
and peter ? what do i tell him ?
jackie ...
okay , then . bye .
there she is .
alicia , marne compton .
hi .
hi .
bowdoin , 2005 . summa cum laude .
she worked for three years at kaplan &amp; cohick ?
personal assistant to mr. cohick .
oh . why &apos;d you leave ?
there was an opportunity with habitat for humanity
building an orphanage in tijuana .
peace corps . belize .
and you know we only have money for one assistant , marne ,
so we would have to share you .
oh , yes . don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m used to high @-@ pressured environments . i like action .
to me , it &apos;s all about time management .
i know you &apos;re juggling three or four cases at once ,
and it &apos;s my job to help catch any balls that get dropped .
i love your boots .
where did you get them ?
oh , why thank you .
i got them at saks fifth avenue .
they have a sale now , and you can &apos;t believe the options .
isn &apos;t she great ?
oh , yes .
so , should i make it happen ?
well , actually , let &apos;s bring in a few more people .
i &apos;ll make some calls .
sure , but we should do this like voir dire or something .
three peremptory challenges , you know ?
hey , did you hear about the rumors ?
stern is retiring .
our stern ?
yeah . we &apos;ll just be lockhart , gardner .
i saw this happen at my dad &apos;s firm--
two partners losing a third .
it was like dawn of the dead .
people fighting over turf .
junior associates lining up against each other .
not us ?
oh , hey , i won &apos;t if you won &apos;t .
we have such a good working relationship .
wow . they &apos;re still on the lakeshore crash ?
i thought we settled that already .
nope . today .
that is our train .
it crashed . your clients crashed it .
do i need to use simpler sentences ?
yes , patti . please . i love it when you patronize me .
cross national freight
entrusted your clients to drive our train .
they drove it too fast .
they derailed it , causing millions in damage .
luckily , it was a freight train and nobody died .
except our clients .
we should be suing you , and not you us .
except for this nagging little problem , patti .
that your company overworked my clients
with double @-@ digit shifts and 18 @-@ hour days .
oh , yes , the sexy overtime evidence .
juries love that .
except for the fact that my clients are heroes .
except ...
yes ?
except for the fact that these three men stayed with your train .
to keep it from crashing into a residential neighborhood ,
saving untold lives .
untold .
i love untold .
my bet is a jury will , too .
will , we &apos;re not picking a jury tomorrow .
judge parks is a pro @-@ business constructionist
who detests nuisance lawsuits as much as i do .
he &apos;s going to grant my motion to dismiss , and you know it .
and i know you know it .
so what do you want ?
make me an offer .
damn it , alicia , i thought i said 3 : 00 .
i &apos;m sorry .
i love watching you , will .
it &apos;s like shakespeare in the park .
this is awkward . i tried to keep it
so that you wouldn &apos;t cross paths with the widows .
heartstrings-- ouch , ouch-- being tugged .
what time is their 60 minutes interview ?
5 : 00 .
we may not need a jury .
but , hey , what do i know ? it &apos;s just 60 minutes .
we know how much they love high @-@ powered executives
and hate grieving widows , right ?
mr. harkin , i &apos;m putting you on speaker .
uh , yeah , fine .
even though it is my belief that we would win a countersuit
against your clients for negligence ,
we are willing to pay out their pensions for ten years .
ten ? ! you kidding ?
does it come with double coupons ?
are you comfortable with that , mr. harkin ?
no. 80 cents on the dollar .
you know , sir , these widows are having trouble paying their rent .
what ? !
one of them is about to lose their house .
she has three children .
what ? who is that ?
i &apos;ll get him up to a dollar .
you get them to agree .
ooh , i have yoga in half an hour .
after that , this deal is dead .
their pension for ten years ?
it &apos;s a come @-@ out offer .
anything ?
pension for ten years .
how much do we have in this ?
partner hours ? 82 .
will they take it ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t think so .
we &apos;re bleeding here .
hey , what was that all about ?
with overby ?
oh , malcolm ? you know him ?
he &apos;s an old friend . just catching up .
so , uh , don &apos;t take a lot of time with it .
just do a basic background check .
malcolm &apos;s an old friend .
what am i looking for ?
stability .
kalinda , one last thing .
i need you to keep this confidential .
i &apos;ll be splitting time with cross national freight .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s possible .
well , if will asks ,
just say i &apos;m having you do work on sheffrin @-@ marks .
i want an apology .
they worked my ... our husbands to death .
they tried to blame them for this accident ,
and now they want to pay ten years on their pensions ?
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. underwood .
i don &apos;t want you to apologize .
i want them to apologize .
they don &apos;t apologize .
money is their apology .
well , i guess then they must not be very sorry .
i think we should take it .
i @-@ i ... i need the money .
i &apos;m a month away from sleeping in my car .
my kids-- they still cry for their dad at night .
look at these bills . i ...
they &apos;re not even paying john &apos;s overtime .
because they want to starve us into a settlement .
let me talk to her again ,
see what they come back with .
but i think we all know we &apos;re in the endgame here .
so , you &apos;ve lost faith ?
i believe cross national freight overworked your husbands
to the point of exhaustion .
i believe that &apos;s why the train crashed ,
but i can &apos;t prove it .
and they can prove the train was moving too fast .
i &apos;m sorry , linda .
so , you still want these ,
denial of overtime claims ?
yes . everything you have .
we &apos;re trying to build to a ...
what ?
would you just give me a moment ?
alicia ,
this offer is walking out the door in ten minutes .
what ?
this is the memo in our discovery .
this is the same memo sent to our clients .
they left off three names .
you can go to yoga now .
we &apos;ll see you in court .
the bottom line is
cross national freight deliberately denied us discovery
by concealing mr. merriman and two other department heads .
your honor , no one has been denied discovery here .
if names were left off documents , it was inadvertent .
inadvertent ? is that what they &apos;re calling wite @-@ out these days ?
your honor , that is just ...
i &apos;m sorry ,
but i find mr. gardener &apos;s charges personally offensive .
mr. merriman and these other two people
have nothing to do with overtime .
then why were they cc &apos;d on a letter denying it ?
mr. gardner , you don &apos;t have enough here to convince a jury .
your honor , with all due respect ...
don &apos;t all due respect me , counselor .
i &apos;m not your high school gym teacher .
on the other hand , ms. nyholm--
inadvertent , my ass .
mr. gardner , how long would it take to depose these witnesses ?
to properly prepare and depose , i would say one month .
you have three days .
three ?
but , your honor , that isn &apos;t ...
now you have two days .
want to try for one ?
no , thank you , your honor .
your honor , if i could just interject here .
these executives are very busy people .
even two hours out of their work day ...
ms. nyholm ,
you just gave mr. gardner back his third day .
would you like to give him a fourth ?
no , your honor . i &apos;ll stop .
good .
we &apos;ll meet back here on friday
to decide whether a dismissal is in order .
does anybody have anything to say ?
okay .
next case .
cancel everything .
for the next 72 hours , we eat , drink and sleep this case .
i wanna bring you a birthday cake .
how &apos;s everything at home , mom ?
good .
she &apos;s working too much , but that &apos;s about it .
alicia ?
what did i say ?
every time you refer to alicia , you say &quot; she . &quot;
do i ?
alicia came home last night at midnight ,
left this morning at 6 : 00 .
i warned her about diane lockhart .
no , no , it &apos;s the other one , will gardner .
i mean , i &apos;m glad they &apos;re friends and all ,
but he needs to give her a break .
day and night , she never stops .
okay , so the goal is this .
i &apos;ll depose merriman .
he &apos;s the vp of operations .
that &apos;s who i think patti &apos;s hiding from us .
the other two-- what are their names ?
jonathan eldredge and sarah conley .
he &apos;s a systems engineer , and she &apos;s in industry relations .
okay , whatever you do , just keep the depos going .
just keep asking questions
so judge parks doesn &apos;t pull the plug on this .
hopefully , i draw enough blood with merriman ,
they &apos;ll up their offer .
remember , the point isn &apos;t to go back to court .
the point is to get them to open their wallets further .
and you &apos;re a mechanical systems manager .
is that correct , mr. eldredge ?
yes .
and this says that you ordered a new public @-@ address system
for passenger cars .
could you explain ?
standard upgrade .
and this says you authorized a new coupling mechanism .
is that right ?
yes . standard upgrade .
and this says-- let &apos;s see--
that you replaced the automated lrs ,
&quot; load regulator system . &quot;
standard upgrade .
your rail traffic has doubled in the last decade ,
but you &apos;ve cut your crews in half , correct ?
there &apos;s more automated equipment .
trains are easier to drive .
and yet it still takes the same amount of time to drive them .
let the record reflect
that mr. merriman shrugged .
let the record reflect , i shrugged , too .
so , ms. conley , you &apos;re saying you have nothing to do
with approving or denying overtime ?
that &apos;s right .
and what about david merriman ?
has he ever approved or denied overtime ?
i don &apos;t recall .
did any of the accident victims work overtime
the week before the lakeshore crash ?
i don &apos;t recall .
did any of them routinely put in for overtime ?
i don &apos;t recall .
ms. conley , are you married ?
i don &apos;t re ...
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , ms. conley .
i &apos;ve got three clients who lost their husbands--
must have been a freudian slip .
the truth is ,
these three employees had gone 24 hours without rest
when this accident occurred .
no , no , they work hard , sure , but ...
you worked them hard , didn &apos;t you ?
i did my job , mr. gardner .
and what was your job , mr. merriman ? tell us .
we pay these people well-- we expect results .
you &apos;re a lawyer , you work people hard here at your firm ?
you bet your ass you do . this is america .
you work hard , get the job done , whatever it takes .
i think we should take a break .
definitely .
let mr. merriman recompose himself .
this guy is a walking disaster .
no wonder they hid him from us .
you should &apos;ve seen patti .
she looked like she was ready to give birth right there .
how &apos;d yours go ?
well , i know more about trains than i ever wanted .
just keep it going .
patti &apos;s on the phone with her overlords
trying to up the offer .
if she does , can you get the widows on the line ?
yeah , linda said she &apos;d stay by the phone .
thanks . you kept them together .
i know that hasn &apos;t easy .
oh , i didn &apos;t do anything .
you can just tell us the number , patti .
have you ever known a fishing expedition to be free , will ?
three more days for discovery--
that went both ways .
oh , come on .
our clients passed every company drug test ...
yes , but this wasn &apos;t the company &apos;s .
this was part of underwood &apos;s application
to renew his health insurance , a week before the crash .
amphetamines ?
that &apos;s right .
your client was on speed .
when i was first starting out , i , uh ,
i got a terrific piece of advice ,
and it &apos;s always stuck with me , and this is it .
everything that happens in a courtroom ...
who did you say he was again ?
malcolm overby .
yeah , i think i &apos;ve heard of him .
back in the time of clarence darrow ,
it was a common practice for people to smoke in the courtroom .
so , do you work with him ?
currently .
rumor is he might be going to another firm .
i just hope he takes me with him .
... cuban cigar and he starts smoking ...
would you excuse me ?
it &apos;s my mother .
i &apos;ll be right back .
what &apos;s up ?
cross national is throwing an insurance drug test at us for underwood .
could you check it out ?
sure , but tomorrow .
uh , what ? why ? what &apos;s up ?
diane &apos;s asked me to do further work on sheffrin @-@ marks .
she what ?
i &apos;ve gotta go .
i can tell from your face , it &apos;s not good .
the company has a drug test .
it says jimmy had amphetamines in his system .
for the longest time
i didn &apos;t think there was evil .
i just thought there were people who did good and bad things .
but now ...
sorry .
that &apos;s the kind of conversation jimmy and i would have .
linda , i have to ask ,
did you know about this ?
alicia ,
jimmy never did drugs .
there &apos;s nothing to know about .
go through your medicine cabinet .
bring me every pill jimmy &apos;s ever taken ,
every pill he could &apos;ve accidentally taken of yours .
could you do that ?
are we gonna win ?
we &apos;re gonna fight .
cole v. wolensky .
&quot; judge may exclude drug test &quot;
&quot; if there &apos;s been a violation of testing procedure . &quot;
judge parks would rather eat his own foot
than offer us relief on that .
kalinda have any leads ?
i ...
no .
she &apos;s doing something with diane .
for diane ? what ?
something for sheffrin @-@ marks .
what ?
we &apos;ve got a power vacuum here .
it makes people do ...
interesting things .
did she say anything about malcolm overby ?
no .
well , i &apos;m giving up on law anyway .
i &apos;m sick of it .
back to the minors ?
i could &apos;ve been a contender .
i liked watching you pitch .
yeah , i had some moments .
we &apos;re the last ones here .
yep .
i should go .
yeah .
me , too .
yeah ?
yeah , mr. gardener . there &apos;s a woman down here
who insists on seeing mrs. florrick .
oh , ms. conley ,
did you forget something ?
i &apos;m not here .
i have a family . i can &apos;t get messed up in this .
okay . let &apos;s talk .
no .
it &apos;s wrong what they &apos;re doing .
blaming them with that drug test .
blaming them for something they ...
something they ... ?
newbury heights .
wait . what ?
newbury heights .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
find out .
how old ?
oh , i &apos;m so stupid .
i should &apos;ve just shut up .
i should &apos;ve just kept walking .
but that would &apos;ve been wrong .
i thought you &apos;d be different .
i thought after what you went through ...
with your family ...
and you come here to my house ?
i &apos;m sorry .
then go .
i can &apos;t .
there are three mothers who are widows now , mrs. conley ...
it &apos;s not my fault .
but it &apos;s somebody &apos;s fault .
what do you want ?
i looked into newbury heights .
i couldn &apos;t find anything .
i went back 50 years .
there &apos;s never been an accident there .
it wasn &apos;t an accident .
it was a near miss .
and it wasn &apos;t one of our trains .
right .
coming into newbury heights , there &apos;s a nine degree curve .
that &apos;s where we jumped the track .
just managed to get the brake on before we hit the commuter train .
did anyone from your company ever identify the problem ?
sure . sure .
they identified me .
said i was going too fast .
but the speed gauge never went above 32 mph .
i thought it was mechanical .
maybe a faulty pressure sensor .
isn &apos;t the pressure sensor part of the load regulator sensor ?
trains , you know .
love them .
so , if you upgraded the lrs ,
wouldn &apos;t you have to replace the pressure sensor , too ?
yeah . fact is , that &apos;s what they did ,
after the near miss ,
they upgraded the lrs .
standard upgrade .
we &apos;ve been going after the wrong thing--
overtime records and not faulty equipment .
they erased those memos not to hide merriman ,
but the structural engineer , our buddy eldredge .
if we can prove he was at newbury heights ...
yep . previous knowledge . we &apos;ll have a case ,
even judge parks can &apos;t kick .
here is the deal . we can &apos;t let patti know we &apos;re changing strategies .
i &apos;ll keep deposing merriman .
you re @-@ depose eldredge .
be ready in ten minutes .
okay .
i think i have someone you &apos;ll be more comfortable with .
i worked 19 years as an assistant .
we called them secretaries in my day .
and are you comfortable with online research , mrs. plack ?
online ?
oh , yeah , everything &apos;s computers nowadays .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m a quick study .
hey , i like your hair this way .
yeah , i do .
it looked so dowdy on tv ,
pulled back like that .
but that must &apos;ve been a hard day , huh ?
what &apos;s the smoking policy here , anyway ?
what ? i thought you two would have a lot in common .
that does not count as a preemptory .
oh , mr. merriman &apos;s is upstairs .
yes , i thought i &apos;d sit in on this one today .
get to know you better .
great .
please .
actually ...
chairs aren &apos;t really my friends these days .
i think i &apos;ll just stand .
so you &apos;re will &apos;s new one ?
yes . i &apos;m his new junior associate .
yeah , that &apos;s what i meant .
the way you look actually ..
i guess he finds you a challenge .
too many blond gigglers ,
and why not go for someone more substantial ,
someone with interesting history .
mrs. nyholm .
i know how this works--
we &apos;re going to try and get into each other &apos;s heads ,
try and unnerve each other .
can i give you a little bit of advice ?
after the past seven months , i &apos;m vaccinated .
fair enough .
let &apos;s get started .
mr. eldredge , two months before the lakeshore crash ,
you authorized an upgrade of the load regulator system
on all cross national freight trains .
can you explain why ?
there wasn &apos;t just one reason .
it was a change we &apos;d planned for some time .
and what about the lrs in the train that crashed ,
did you replace that one ?
i don &apos;t believe we did .
the @-@ the upgrade takes some time ,
and we couldn &apos;t have all of our engines out of commission at once .
i understand that .
tell me about newbury heights ,
mr. eldredge .
what ?
tell me about it .
it &apos;s , uh ...
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
june 21 , you went to newbury heights
to check out a near miss collision , isn &apos;t that right ?
would you like to take a break ?
if you were to learn there was a problem
with a piece of equipment on your trains , mr. eldredge ,
you &apos;d replace the part , wouldn &apos;t you ?
of course i would .
and you &apos;d make sure that
no trains were operating with unsafe equipment ?
look , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
no , you don &apos;t .
i never once ...
my apologies .
we &apos;re gonna have to break this off here .
oh , come on . objection .
let the record reflect
deposition was suspended for medical reasons .
and again , i @-@ i apologize .
mr. eldredge .
sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
hi , jackie . it &apos;s me .
i saw that you called .
dad .
dad .
zach ?
it &apos;s you !
i ... i missed you .
i know .
grace .
go to him .
grace .
happy birthday , dad .
so , you still a fish or what ?
yep , still a fish .
just like in oz .
they do shakedowns every day ?
your honor , will gardner . this is my third message .
defense counsel &apos;s interrupted deposition for the day and we ...
damn it .
he &apos;s lying .
what ?
he knew exactly what newbury heights was .
he said he was in the office all day .
but you have to swipe that every time you exit and ente
which means we can tell exactly
what time he came and went .
i can &apos;t get the judge on the phone ,
but if i hurry , i &apos;ll catch him .
what are you doing ?
getting a court order
for cross national freight &apos;s security records .
find kalinda , tell her to meet me down at the courthouse .
oh , listen , i &apos;ll call you about that ...
diane has a boyfriend .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
work .
it &apos;s just so pretty .
thank you .
what time did you get in ?
late . you were asleep .
thanks , by the way .
this should be the last late night for a while .
i took grace and zach to see peter .
you did what ?
i took grace and zach to see their father for his birthday .
jackie , i @-@ i ...
i @-@ i &apos;m thunderstruck .
i tried to phone you .
you tried to phone me ?
we discussed this .
i was taking them next week .
it worked out perfectly , seeing him .
they were perfect .
jackie .
i am their mother .
it is my decision .
this of all things is my decision !
i &apos;m sorry . it was spontaneous .
you don &apos;t supervise my kids spontaneously .
you don &apos;t take them to prison .
you don &apos;t just try and phone me .
you phone me .
you respect me as a mother
or you leave .
i am doing the best i can .
well , join the club .
overby &apos;s firm is well capitalized ,
excellent client base ,
no ethics charges ,
no bankruptcies , no judgments .
but are you sure that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking for ?
i ... don &apos;t know .
should i be looking for something else ?
well , that &apos;s like asking a dentist
whether you should brush .
see what you can find out .
and , kalinda , again , this is just between you and me .
you understand ?
yeah .
do you know how much you pay jury consultants ?
no .
$ 100,000 for three months work .
that sounds about right .
do you know how much i make ?
i have a feeling i &apos;m finding out .
a fourth of that .
that sounds outrageous .
yeah , it does , doesn &apos;t it ?
subpoenaed records of security entrances
from may to august .
thanks .
so , kalinda , can i ask you ...
this thing you &apos;re doing with diane ,
does it have anything to do with malcolm overby ?
no .
it doesn &apos;t ?
no , you can &apos;t ask me .
it &apos;s just ...
if he &apos;s coming on as a third partner ,
will should know .
you can &apos;t ask me and i can &apos;t tell you
but don &apos;t conclude from what i &apos;m saying it &apos;s what you think .
okay .
can you be any more specific ?
no .
wait , here &apos;s the date , june 21 .
it would take him about two hours
to get out to newbury heights .
he leaves the office at 6 : 42 p.m. ,
and he comes back ...
an hour later .
that &apos;s not enough time .
what about the next day ?
same thing . 9 : 48 p.m. ,
comes back at 10 : 33 p.m.
wait .
that &apos;s someone else .
oh , you &apos;re right . that &apos;s sarah conley .
oh , here he is .
eldredge ...
he left and came back a few minutes later .
that &apos;s interesting .
what ?
look .
see , here it is again .
sarah conley leaves within a few minutes of eldredge ,
she comes back a few minutes after him .
same here , 9 : 30 p.m.
me , too ...
8 : 45 p.m.
and on august 5 , the night of the lakeshore crash ,
same thing .
they &apos;re always the last two working together at night .
yeah , well , so are we .
yeah , but they &apos;re leaving and returning
within a few minutes of each other on foot .
and you know what &apos;s across from their building ?
the stanford plaza hotel .
i think they were having an affair .
jonathan eldredge is denying everything .
that &apos;s not my problem .
all the nights you went
to the hotel with him across the street ,
that is your problem .
oh , my god .
sarah , i don &apos;t care about your personal life .
that &apos;s your business .
all i care about is what he said to you
the night of the accident , that &apos;s all .
he wanted to talk ; he was so upset .
he said he knew for a while
there was a problem with the pressure sensor .
he &apos;d been trying to fix it quietly .
sarah , i need to demonstrate
that eldredge knew about the problem
before the accident .
but there &apos;s no document , there &apos;s no smoking gun ,
and i don &apos;t have the time to find one .
all i &apos;ve got is you .
i can &apos;t testify !
this isn &apos;t about the affair , sarah .
this is about the accident .
the only way i know about the accident
is because of the affair , and i will have to talk about it .
if i don &apos;t , they &apos;ll bring it up .
they &apos;ll say i &apos;m getting back at him ,
that i &apos;m bitter .
you know how they &apos;ll twist this around .
there &apos;s no other way .
i &apos;m sorry , hon . dylan only wants you .
is everything all right ?
yeah , fine .
i love you .
how old did you say dylan was ?
three months .
it &apos;s not just me .
it &apos;s my husband , it &apos;s my other kids ,
it &apos;s a baby .
they have nothing to do with this ,
but if you make me testify ...
please don &apos;t do to me what somebody did to you .
wow , you are really obsessed with him .
not obsessed . intrigued .
so , is he seeing anyone ?
so that &apos;s what this is about .
you want me to introduce you ?
no .
i was just ...
introduce whom ?
malcolm overby .
kalinda .
kalinda what ?
kalinda smith .
uh , i &apos;m a lawyer .
my firm threw this party .
what do you do ?
i crash other people &apos;s parties .
so , if i gave you my card ,
what are the chances you &apos;d use it ?
i &apos;d say pretty good .
use it however you want .
so , i take it you have some information .
yeah .
i looked deeper into mr. overby ,
and i don &apos;t think he &apos;s a good candidate for partnership .
based on my investigation ,
he appears to be nonexclusive .
nonexclusive ?
in pursuit of other options .
openly in pursuit .
are you sure ?
positive .
the firm can do better .
well , thank you , kalinda ,
for your discretion in this matter .
always .
kalinda , let &apos;s talk tomorrow about renegotiating your contract .
i &apos;d like that .
this is it .
every pill in our medicine cabinet .
and this ... this is a prescription jimmy got
a month before the accident .
it &apos;s for allergies .
do you think that could be it ?
it could be .
the drug test didn &apos;t screen for pseudoephedrine .
not in this dosage .
thanks , linda .
have a good night .
you , too .
was it frightening ?
no .
i just ... i don &apos;t like him in there .
i like seeing dad in a suit .
yeah , me , too .
so , you &apos;re okay ?
yeah , i mean , i &apos;m mad at him ,
but he &apos;s still dad .
what about you ?
you look sad .
no .
it &apos;s just this case i &apos;m working on .
might have to do something i don &apos;t want to .
something ?
you know , like what happened to us .
well , you said &quot; might . &quot;
is there another way ?
not that i can think of .
well , you &apos;re a lawyer , right ?
you have to represent your client .
even if it means hurting another family ?
well , if you didn &apos;t ,
you &apos;d just hurt your client , right ?
you have to do your job .
you can &apos;t just not do your job .
so three days later , and you still
have depositions to conduct ?
your honor , ms. nyholm stomped out
of mr. eldredge &apos;s deposition
two days ago , and we have been constrained
with questioning mrs. conley and mr. eldredge ever since .
as melodramatic
as mr. gardner &apos;s account is ,
your honor , i think the last time
i stomped out of anywhere was the third grade .
unless i &apos;ve grown bigger than i thought .
uh , we ask , your honor ,
for an open deposition , so that you may rule ...
they &apos;re going to force her to testify in open court ?
if she denies the affair ,
they &apos;ll accuse her of perjury .
then , everything she says
in court will get thrown out .
who are you deposing ?
ms. sarah conley , your honor .
please don &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m so sorry .
mrs. conley , what did mr. jonathan eldredge
tell you on the night of august 5,
a few hours after the lakeshore crash ?
objection , your honor .
no foundation .
ms. florrick has yet to establish access .
your honor , do we need to establish access ?
they work in the same company .
but in vastly different departments .
sustained .
ms. conley , where were you on the evening of august 5
after the lakeshore crash ?
i was in a hotel room downtown .
were you alone ?
no .
i was with jonathan eldredge .
mr. harkin , can ... can you hear us ?
no , no , that &apos;s good enough .
where is your assistant ?
i don &apos;t know . she quit .
it &apos;s very hard to find a good assistant these days .
mr. harkin , i &apos;m going to make our final offer now .
go ahead .
i think you can see this meets
all of your demands and then some .
and one condition that we don &apos;t go to trial .
i think we can handle that .
there is one other thing .
they want an apology .
excuse me ?
fine .
mr. harkin ?
just settle this thing , will you ?
well , patti ...
it &apos;s always a pleasure .
until next time .
mrs. florrick .
excuse me . you got a minute ?
sure .
this one looks pretty good , and if you don &apos;t like this one ,
i think we need to start looking at the new crop of ivy leaguers .
courtney , this is alicia florrick .
hi .
hi .
i didn &apos;t expect you .
spur of the moment .
sorry i missed your birthday .
the kids said the visit went well .
yeah , they ... they look great .
zach &apos;s almost as tall as i am .
three months , then suddenly , boom .
mom tells me you &apos;re working on a hard case .
i guess you &apos;re putting in a lot of hours with will .
a lot of time to think about things in here .
a lot of time out there , too .
he &apos;s not what he seems , alicia .
peter , if it &apos;s one thing i &apos;m learning ...
nobody is .
gardner acts like he &apos;s this good guy
and he &apos;s everybody &apos;s best friend ,
but i could tell you a few things about him .
what ?
can we ... can we at least acknowledge
how ironic this conversation is ?
i love you .
i was thinking about our apartment on 81st street .
remember ?
no air @-@ conditioning .
it was so hot you &apos;d ... you &apos;d run around
in that t @-@ shirt you got from the mexican restaurant below .
all i could think was ,
god , you were the most beautiful woman in the world .
then ?
no . then and now .
i don &apos;t want to lose you .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
i lost my way .
i ... i got on a power trip .
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t blame it on that .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , it &apos;s me .
i understand .
i understand .
but don &apos;t give up on me .
come on , don &apos;t give up on me .
