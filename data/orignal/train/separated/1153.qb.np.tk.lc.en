it &apos;s beautiful .
is that aria ? answer me !
yeah .
why do you care that jason &apos;s moved back ?
this isn &apos;t something for you to worry about , spencer ,
but for the time being ,
you stay away from jason delaurentis .
mike broke into your house ?
never got in , actually .
what were you looking for ?
i won &apos;t do it again . just , please ...
don &apos;t tell .
it wasn &apos;t ian who hired logan reed --
the guy who delivered the money in the woods .
count it if you like .
i believe you .
i never expected to feel this kind of loss over leaving you .
i spoke to hanna &apos;s mom , and she said
that she could look after you .
you mean i could stay with them ?
i thought you left this morning
to go to your house where your fiancee isabel lives .
no , you &apos;re staying here
because you &apos;re still in love with mom .
i thought you were getting your own room .
that was before the pipes went off behind the walls .
they had to fix the pipes and put the wall back in ,
so we &apos;re roomies till then .
it &apos;ll be fun .
i know it &apos;s gonna be like a sleepover that never ends .
has garrett called you
about ian &apos;s messenger ?
not a sound .
guys , we dragged garrett into this .
we just gotta trust him .
we &apos;re trusting him with ian &apos;s $ 10,000
and i could &apos;ve used some of that
to replace melissa &apos;s ring .
and if they traced the money from ian to you ?
how would you explain that ?
i just don &apos;t like waiting .
if we &apos;re too quiet , &quot; a &quot; will get bored and stir the pot .
and if we say something , &quot; a &apos;s &quot; gonna smack us down .
i don &apos;t wanna walk into another &quot; a @-@ stravaganza &quot;
like that fashion show .
god , the look on mrs. dilaurentis &apos;s face .
this ...
isn &apos;t just about making us look like bitches anymore , is it ?
no . it &apos;s about keeping us quiet .
why ?
because &quot; a &quot; might really be the one who killed ali .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re all thinking , isn &apos;t it ?
why else go through all the trouble of setting up ian ?
you guys .
look at the card .
what fun ! two little liars under one roof .
you are making it so easy .
a
it &apos;s really not that dressy ,
it &apos;s really not that dressy ,
just like a few couple of people coming over
like we used to do .
i know . it &apos;s the first one since you move back in .
you look lovely in both .
you talk like a mom .
thank you .
mike , breakfast in five minutes .
gotta go .
he eats at school . i &apos;ve seen him .
i like that one .
yeah ?
it makes you look very grown up .
byron , did you catch mike ?
no , he escaped before i could grab him .
but he knows we want him here .
he knows , i just want to make sure
he doesn &apos;t blow it off at the last minute .
nancy partha called .
elliott finally approved a sitter ,
so they will be here .
the scotacs won &apos;t . he called .
his mother fell off her riding mower .
oh . is she all right ?
bruised hip . shredded azaleas .
so , just us and the parthas ?
well , i was thinking i would invite ezra fitz .
he met elliott . they got along pretty well .
it &apos;s kind of short notice .
ezra still seems a little lost around campus .
he &apos;s not aria &apos;s teacher anymore , he &apos;s a colleague ,
so no conflict of interest .
i &apos;ll tell him he can invite a date .
hmm . that should be interesting .
oh ! hi . perfect timing .
emily , you didn &apos;t have to do this .
i wanted to . i want to thank you for letting me stay here .
you &apos;re welcome . it &apos;s great to have you here .
please , sit .
are you gonna do this every morning ?
my mom always says not to wait
until you &apos;re leaving to say thank you .
how is your mom ? have you talked to her ?
uh , yeah , i spoke to her after my run .
it &apos;s dad . he &apos;ll come by later .
did you throw your back out flipping the omelets ?
i upped my training ,
and it &apos;s taking a while to get used to it .
oh , toast &apos;s up .
so , how much of a tip should we leave her ?
watch out , i might go for the daughter upgrade .
spencer , are you sure toby can handle it ?
yeah , he can do the prep work
while melissa and mom are out of town .
you know , it &apos;s not just the barn .
i want to clear out everything back to the property line .
he can do that , and then
you can make sure that the contractor
hires him for the nursery extension .
i think we owe him .
yes . yes , we do .
he can get the back of the barn ready
before jason finishes that fence .
oh , there &apos;s not gonna be a fence .
there isn &apos;t ?
no , i stopped that .
called the surveyor . he was building on our property .
that family is nothing if not consistent ,
always crossing the line .
just have toby call me , okay ?
see you downstairs .
okay .
you have to come up with an excuse .
just call up my dad and say thanks but no thanks .
i already said yes .
okay , change your mind .
i just don &apos;t want to spend a quiet evening
with my parents , you , and your date .
i &apos;m not bringing anybody .
it &apos;s still a bad idea .
it &apos;s a good idea .
matter of fact , it &apos;s your good idea .
look , if we &apos;re ever gonna figure out what happens next ,
we need to find a way for your parents
to see us together as a couple .
didn &apos;t really work last time .
we weren &apos;t going to get off to a good start over an open grave .
but ... at your parent &apos;s house ,
a nice , adult atmosphere ...
they &apos;d get used to seeing us
across from them at the table .
my dad did say you &apos;re not my teacher anymore ,
so it wouldn &apos;t be a conflict of interest .
you wanted a baby step . this could be it .
but only if you say so .
okay .
great .
so , what are you making tomorrow , french toast ?
does your mom like french toast ?
it &apos;s a joke , attempt at humor .
i don &apos;t want to be a bad guest .
em , you &apos;re not a guest .
it &apos;s your house now . relax .
this is me relaxed .
well , then , we &apos;re gonna have to work on that .
i &apos;m gonna catch up with you inside .
okay .
what was that ?
i just got stiffed .
i totally pimped that guy &apos;s phone , and now he won &apos;t pay .
what are you gonna do ?
well , i can &apos;t take him to small @-@ claims court .
well , that wouldn &apos;t happen if you went legit .
legit is in the eye of the beholder .
is your foster mom still giving you support checks ?
yeah , but that &apos;s just room and board .
i need investment capital .
look , caleb , you know that if you need money ...
if i do , i will figure it out .
you don &apos;t have to fight all of my fights .
okay .
missed you this morning .
just wanted to remind you
that we have people coming over tomorrow night .
i don &apos;t think i can make it .
well , it &apos;s kind of important .
i &apos;ve got stuff .
well , elliott partha &apos;s coming . you remember him ?
he &apos;s the lacrosse coach at hollis .
i thought this would be a good opportunity ...
i &apos;m busy .
mike !
i want you to make yourself unbusy .
this is very important . it &apos;s the first family party
we &apos;ve had since your mom has been back ,
and we want you here .
okay .
okay .
wow . you don &apos;t waste any time .
these days , if somebody offers me a job ,
i don &apos;t give them a chance to change their mind .
well , i figure i can set up a chair
and just fan myself while i watch you work ...
or i can make you a grilled cheese sandwich .
mm , i &apos;d like both .
toby ! thought you &apos;d start tomorrow .
i was just clearing the ground .
i was thinking about what you might want to do with the barn .
i &apos;m not an architect ,
but i made some sketches .
these are great .
can i keep these ?
sure .
uh , i &apos;m kind of sweaty .
yeah , well , i can handle it .
mom .
hey !
look who i ran into .
hello , aria .
hi .
i just dropped by to see mr. ellis .
oh , the guidance counselor ?
jason offered to talk to some of our at @-@ risk students .
stoners in training , like i was .
i &apos;m gonna tell them that there is life after high school .
well , i &apos;d better get going .
and thanks again for the note you sent my mom .
it really meant a lot to her .
really ? i &apos;m so glad .
so , can i bring anything tomorrow ?
no , please . just yourself .
tomorrow ?
yeah , i invited jason to dinner .
see you tomorrow night .
why did you invite him to dinner ?
what do you mean ? is there a problem ?
no , just a little surprised , i guess .
you sent mrs dilaurentis a note ?
yes , after the fashion show .
that &apos;s why you invited him , because of what happened ?
i suppose that was partly the reason ,
but , you know , his family &apos;s been through a lot ,
and i thought he could use some human companionship .
don &apos;t you ?
i guess so .
aria , the fashion show ...
i told you , mom !
it wasn &apos;t any of us .
and i believe you , , but it was somebody ,
and i don &apos;t like the idea of anybody terrorizing my kids ,
so if there &apos;s somebody at
school that your father and i need to know about --
no , it &apos;s just a stupid prank .
it didn &apos;t mean anything .
okay , well , if you think of something , anything ,
let me know .
okay .
oh , and your dad said mr. fitz can come .
terrific .
you probably want to get used to calling him ezra .
yeah .
hanna !
hey , okay , my earbuds were in . you couldn &apos;t even hear my music .
that didn &apos;t stop you from singing .
how &apos;d i sound ?
loud .
you know , we should do a video together ,
like all of us .
not tonight .
are you okay ?
it &apos;s nothing .
what was going on with caleb this morning ?
business .
he still has business ?
yeah , he does .
how do you feel about that ?
you sound like dr. sullivan .
and you didn &apos;t answer my question .
so , you having fun at hanna &apos;s ?
every night &apos;s a sleepover , even school nights .
uh @-@ oh .
no uh @-@ oh .
i &apos;m lucky it worked out the way it did .
very lucky . seriously .
morning .
morning .
hey , did you talk to garrett yet ?
not yet . i &apos;ve been slammed with practice and the new workout .
okay , uh , well , do you want me to try ?
yes . you &apos;re better at getting people to talk , anyway .
i am ?
you are .
yeah . tag up later , okay ?
okay , bye .
bye .
will you come with me to talk to garrett ?
i can &apos;t . i told my mom i &apos;d go home and help her with dinner .
oh ! that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s &quot; guess who &apos;s coming to dinner &quot; night .
you &apos;re so not helping .
no , it &apos;s gonna go better than you think .
trust me , mr. fitz will knock &apos; em dead .
it &apos;s not just ezra .
my mom invited jason .
wait , she did what ?
yeah , he was here at school ,
and she was talking to him ,
and invited him to dinner .
she invited him into your house ?
yeah .
she said she feels sorry for him .
but i guess i understand .
i -- i &apos;m late .
logan reed quit his job at the messenger service
after emily talked to him .
she scared him .
she scared him plenty .
he &apos;s registered at hollis college ,
but no one &apos;s seen him in class for a week .
he &apos;s been crashing with a buddy ,
but , uh , buddy says he &apos;s gone .
gone .
this guy can &apos;t stay underwater for long .
we &apos;ll find him .
if i hear anything , i &apos;ll call you , okay ?
okay .
but , uh , spencer ,
don &apos;t expect to find any surprises here .
all these loose ends ,
they &apos;re all gonna lead back to the same place .
ian .
i had a feeling you would call .
did hanna say anything
about what happened at the fashion show ?
i didn &apos;t press her on it .
what do you think that was ?
well , you know about mean girls .
they had &apos; em when we were in school .
not like this , we didn &apos;t .
no , not like this .
and i don &apos;t think this just started .
i think it &apos;s been going on for a while ,
and we &apos;re just now noticing it .
i think you &apos;re right .
you do ?
alison ?
hanna being hit by that car ?
ian in the bell tower , everything else ?
it &apos;s easy to get paranoid ,
start seeing connections where there aren &apos;t any connections .
i just knew if
i didn &apos;t speak to another parent about this ,
my head was going to explode .
who else have you talked to ?
well , emily &apos;s mom is in texas ,
and i didn &apos;t really want to do this over the phone .
the hastings ?
i &apos;ll tell you one thing .
i think we rolled over way too quickly
on that therapist deal , separating the girls ?
i am not gonna do that again .
it seemed to make sense at the time .
that wasn &apos;t about helping anyone .
that was about peter hastings .
never met a problem he couldn &apos;t buy off ,
one way or the other .
what have you got there ?
oh , i was just clearing the ivy , and ...
where was this ?
right here , about half a foot down on the property line .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
what is it ?
nothing to worry about .
why would somebody bury it ?
it &apos;s all right , toby .
i said i &apos;ll take care of it .
okay .
is everything okay ?
has he noticed we are gone ?
does he looks anxious at all ?
thanks , byron .
thought you were kidding .
no kidding .
i may have carried the baby for nine months ,
but elliott &apos;s planning to carry him straight through college .
if you ever need a sitter , you should call me .
i &apos;d love to do it .
that &apos;d be great !
just stop by the house with a blood sample .
the background check won &apos;t take more than an hour .
hey , where &apos;s mike ?
well , he promised he &apos;d be here , so ...
uh , yeah , he &apos;s on his own clock .
you &apos;ll find out about that soon enough .
hello .
so glad you could make it .
thank you for inviting me .
thank you .
for you .
aria .
hi , ezra .
i &apos;ll put these in some water .
ezra !
hey .
byron . a gift for the host .
whoa , this is serious scotch .
well , always works for me .
uh , byron ? help ?
excuse me .
is that the scotch you said
tasted like diet cola and iodine ?
yes , until i asked the guy
at the liquor store what your dad liked .
this is nancy partha . this is ezra .
hi , ezra fitz .
nice to meet you .
good to see you , elliott .
hey . come in .
sorry i &apos;m late .
uh , no , it &apos;s fine .
thanks .
a hockey stick ?
part of one .
it was snapped off at the handle ,
and the blade was splintered ,
like somebody used it to hit something hard .
and it was buried ?
i thought it was some old junk ,
until your dad saw it .
what did he say ?
at first , i thought he was angry .
now i think he might &apos;ve been scared .
it was white and blue .
those are rosewood colors .
there was a piece of tape on what was left of the handle .
it had &quot; hastings &quot; written on it .
was that yours or melissa &apos;s ?
it &apos;s just an old practice stick i use sometimes .
it was melissa &apos;s .
it &apos;ll do .
no , it &apos;s like this .
ali , when did you become so interested in field hockey ?
i &apos;m not .
yet .
i &apos;m just considering my options .
oh ! maybe you &apos;re interested in someone
who &apos;s interested in field hockey ?
boys don &apos;t play field hockey .
you don &apos;t have to play the game to be interested .
that &apos;s the same stick that toby found
buried behind my house .
are you sure ?
absolutely the same one .
how did it get in your backyard ?
well , you don &apos;t bury old sporting equipment ,
but you do bury murder weapons .
are you serious ?
it was in ali &apos;s bedroom
the summer she was killed .
anybody could &apos;ve used it .
anybody ?
alison .
mom wants you .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
she didn &apos;t say why , okay ? just go .
i got better things to do than hunt you down .
like what ?
what &apos;s this for ?
it &apos;s for me .
oh , yeah ?
give it back .
oh , yeah ?
give it back , jason .
or what ?
be careful !
too bad .
you &apos;re not gonna get a second chance , ali .
jason was in the house that summer .
but so was ian .
yeah , but jason is the one
who says he can &apos;t remember the night ali disappeared ,
and i &apos;m starting to think that is awfully convenient .
spencer , look ,
this could just be &quot; a &quot; playing with us again .
except that we didn &apos;t find this .
somebody else did ,
and if my dad hadn &apos;t stopped jason from building
that fence , no one ever would &apos;ve found it .
what &apos;s your dad saying about this ?
i haven &apos;t spoken to him yet .
he &apos;s in a meeting . he won &apos;t be home till late .
aria !
hey , i gotta go .
aria , think about this .
think about what this means .
i &apos;ll think about it . bye .
em , you don &apos;t have to go to the library .
it won &apos;t bother me if you study here .
all due respect , studying here
is like studying at the mall .
i study at the mall all the time .
yeah , well , i &apos;m different .
is this a gay thing ?
no , it &apos;s a brain thing .
hello .
hello . good @-@ bye .
was it something i said ?
she &apos;s just so studious , that &apos;s all .
your mom home ?
no , she &apos;s out to dinner with my dad .
what &apos;s that mean ?
it means ... &quot; oh . &quot;
i was either going to japan or europe .
i ended up biking through connor pass
on my way to kerry .
so , why did you pick ireland ?
i love joyce and beckett .
i wanted to see where they started .
and you did it by bike ? that &apos;s great .
i &apos;ve got a bike in my garage .
every morning it mocks me .
oh , you &apos;ll get back on it .
just have to add a baby seat .
you cycle ?
uh , some , yeah .
when i first took off from college , i did the kona coast .
that &apos;s where they have the triathlon , right ?
yeah , i wanted to clear my head before i came back here .
riding those lava fields is like
being on the moon , you know ?
that &apos;s intense .
yeah , it &apos;s what i needed .
aria .
hi .
are your parents home ?
mom ? dad ?
hi , barry .
sorry to interrupt ,
but it &apos;s about mike .
he &apos;s okay , but we have a situation .
what kind of situation ?
looks like he broke into a house .
he what ?
over on morrison .
there &apos;s gotta be some kind of mistake .
i &apos;m afraid not . it &apos;s mike .
he must &apos;ve thought the place was empty .
homeowner grabbed him and called us .
he &apos;s at the station now .
if i could get you to come down there ...
yes , of course . do you want to stay here ?
no , no , we &apos;ll both go .
aria . aria , please stay here .
yeah .
toby .
hey . glad i caught you .
i wanted to talk to you about today .
is this about the hockey stick ?
i thought it was junk from the dilaurentis &apos;s yard .
i have a real problem with them .
it said &quot; hastings &quot; on the stick .
yeah , i realized that . i also realized
it might &apos;ve looked a little strange , my taking it that way .
i didn &apos;t want you to get the wrong idea . it was nothing .
um , you know , in fact , if you talk with spencer ,
don &apos;t bother mentioning it to her , okay ?
too late .
you told her .
didn &apos;t know i shouldn &apos;t .
what &apos;d she say ?
it didn &apos;t seem to mean anything to her .
there &apos;s no point in telling her about this conversation , is there ?
no , sir .
good night , toby .
thanks for all the hard work .
good night , mr. hastings .
hey , i got this .
no , no .
i kind of just want to keep moving .
okay .
the parthas took that salad , right ?
yeah , they just wanted to go home .
separation anxiety .
not the anticipated evening , was it ?
no . you were doing really well .
i was , wasn &apos;t i ?
yeah . do you practice much at home ?
oh , just the initial hellos and smile .
so , uh , who &apos;s jason ?
he &apos;s ali &apos;s brother .
no , i know that .
i just didn &apos;t know he was friends of the family .
yeah , my mom and his mom are friends .
i &apos;m gonna go see if he wants more coffee .
great , i &apos;ll run the dishwasher .
okay .
you want some more ?
sure , a little .
mike promised me he wouldn &apos;t do this anymore .
he probably meant it when he said it .
give me that . sit down .
take a breath .
he must be so angry at me .
why would mike be angry at you ?
because ...
we &apos;re in the middle of this mess with ian and mom and dad .
if it weren &apos;t for me , he probably
would &apos;ve gotten more attention from my parents .
no , no , no . trust me ,
you &apos;re not the reason mike is doing this .
how do you know that ?
i know a lot about misplaced guilt .
look , the amount of trouble mike &apos;s in
depends on how many times he &apos;s done this .
do you have any idea how many places he &apos;s broken into ?
mike . mike !
mike , wait .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
you don &apos;t want to talk about it ,
but you are going to talk about it .
how was the dinner party ?
it was fine , till the cops showed up to let us know
that our son had been arrested for breaking and entering .
byron .
get in the car .
you &apos;re angry .
what ?
and you &apos;re not ?
oh , no , i &apos;m angry , but more importantly ,
how did we miss this ?
i don &apos;t even know what &quot; this &quot; is .
well , he &apos;s not a criminal , so it &apos;s gotta be about something else .
what ? what could he possibly be walking around with
that he couldn &apos;t talk to us about ?
i don &apos;t know , but maybe we need to do a better job asking .
so , you teach at hollis .
yes .
is that how you know professor montgomery ?
yes , and i taught with ella at rosewood high this year .
did you have aria ?
in any of your classes .
yes , i did .
i was just thinking you should go now .
what , the both of us ?
yes , please .
are you sure ?
my parents are going to be home with mike any second ,
and it &apos;s probably a good idea
that he doesn &apos;t have to deal with anyone but family right now .
okay .
do you want us to help finish cleaning up ?
no , i &apos;m good , really .
let me know how your brothth &apos;s doing .
i &apos;ll call .
we &apos;ll talk tomorrow ?
yes , absolutely . thanks . i &apos;m sorry .
good night .
good night .
buy it now and save some money .
you &apos;re gonna want it next week ,
and i can &apos;t guarantee that price .
done .
don &apos;t start .
i &apos;m not trying to change you .
then you shouldn &apos;t push me on this stuff .
i &apos;m not pushing , i &apos;m suggesting .
what , that i should be frying burgers for minimum wage ?
i &apos;m just saying i see you doing this sketchy stuff
and i worry about you .
what i &apos;m doing now is legit compared to other stuff .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means you already know more about me than anybody else ,
so why can &apos;t we just keep it where it is ?
all right .
so , where do you come down on the whole natural
versus synthetic extensions debate ?
i mean , does affordability and easy maintenance
really outweigh the look and feel of real human hair ?
okay .
two years ago , i was living in allentown ,
and there were these guys ...
actual bad guys .
they stole cars on order .
i did some work for them ...
hacking into the dmv ,
laundering vin numbers .
nobody got hurt ,
but it was just a matter of time ,
so i got out .
and these guys were really not happy about it .
before they could figure out what to do , i was gone .
so , trust me , i know the difference
between sketchy and criminal .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this , but ...
maybe you should tell the cops .
there &apos;s a difference between being honest and being suicidal .
you &apos;ve never told anyone this , have you ?
no .
i haven &apos;t .
and i &apos;d appreciate you keeping it to yourself .
cross my heart .
no .
spencer , go upstairs .
please .
spencer ...
please .
let go !
stop . let go ! stop it .
you can &apos;t burn that .
i can do whatever i want with junk i find on my property .
but it could be evidence .
we don &apos;t need more evidence
now that ian thomas is in a grave i paid for .
please , try to understand .
i &apos;m tired , spencer .
your mother is tired .
and i &apos;m not taking the chance of more questions
over some damn piece of wood .
this is over .
no more questions .
it could be important .
important ?
like the trophy you found ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t put that in the yard .
it doesn &apos;t matter who put it there or why .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
it &apos;s nothing .
it doesn &apos;t exist .
i told them it didn &apos;t mean anything to you .
i &apos;m sorry you had to lie .
no , it doesn &apos;t matter .
when i came down the stairs
and i saw what he was doing ,
i thought , &quot; oh , my god , he thinks i killed her . &quot;
no , he couldn &apos;t think that . nobody could .
he didn &apos;t .
he thought it was a prop .
he thought it was something that i just made up
to cause trouble and be the center of attention .
that &apos;s all he sees when he looks at me .
that &apos;s all he &apos;s ever gonna see
until we find out what happened .
well , then , we &apos;ll have to find out .
ali got up and walked away .
and then somewhere between the kissing rock and her backyard ,
somebody hit her .
now you &apos;re thinking they hit her with your hockey stick ?
the paper said that it was blunt force trauma ,
but they don &apos;t say what was used .
that &apos;s the stuff they never give you in newspapers .
the police hold back details
so they won &apos;t have to deal with a lot of crackpots .
you think they know what was used ?
cops always know more than they tell .
he &apos;s never told anyone , but he told me .
because he trusts you .
you think so ?
yes .
so , you don &apos;t mind that i tell you
he told me this thing ,
but i can &apos;t tell you what it is ?
i don &apos;t mind . i &apos;ve got all the secrets i need right now .
look , it &apos;ll be okay , em .
you &apos;ll do great this year ,
and danby will offer you a scholarship ,
and your folks will never find out .
we &apos;ll make sure of it .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m here .
so am i.
and i &apos;m glad caleb came back for you .
yeah . he came back for me .
is your dad getting back with your mom ?
you promised .
stay out of my room .
uhh ! you took things from emily .
you broke into spencer &apos;s house .
you stole from a blind girl !
no , i didn &apos;t .
this is from jenna marshall &apos;s . she makes these .
i don &apos;t care what she makes .
i didn &apos;t break into that house .
that candle thing comes from an apartment over a garage on willoughby .
whose apartment ?
officer mcfriendly .
garrett reynolds ?
i was looking for maybe a gun
or something i could use to get away from here .
he &apos;s a cop , and he &apos;s got crap like that in his place .
no , you &apos;re wrong .
i thought it might be worth a couple of bucks , so i took it .
and a camera and a gps .
this has to be from jenna mmrshall &apos;s .
i know what i stole ,
and i know where i stole it from .
i got that from garrett reynolds &apos; apartment .
there you go .
thanks for letting me see you .
it sounded important when you called .
i have to ask you something .
do the police know what kind of weapon
the killer used on allison ?
they never found the murder weapon ,
spencer , you know that .
but do they know what it might &apos;ve been ?
it would all be in the coroner &apos;s report .
they can tell a lot about a weapon
by the kind of wound it leaves .
so , in the report it would say what she was hit with ,
like , how big , how hard , how sharp ,
if it was a man or a woman that used it .
spencer , slow down . it &apos;s like i said before .
all of these loose ends , they &apos;re not gonna change
the main fact :
it was ian , and he &apos;s gone .
you need to take that in .
ali &apos;s killer is dead .
i &apos;m not so sure .
why not ?
l @-@ 31 , are you still code seven ?
l @-@ 31 , roger .
l @-@ 35 is requesting a code eight ...
i can roll if he needs me .
over .
roger that .
all right . if it wasn &apos;t ian ,
