gossip girl here ,
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
blair waldorf working the door .
i got an internship at &quot; w. &quot;
knowing you , you &apos;ll be editor by may .
he shouldn &apos;t have been having an affair with a student .
he never touched me , mom .
you sent an innocent man to prison .
ben , you came . can we talk ?
i see that look in your eye ,
and i know exactly what it means ,
but i don &apos;t want to be with you .
i realize my wife hasn &apos;t treated you justly in any way ,
but i &apos;d like to help .
i have an extra room at my loft , and i &apos;d love if you moved in .
my father &apos;s gonna do everything humanly possible
to acquire bass industries .
i don &apos;t want to stop seeing you .
i can handle the complications if you can .
it &apos;s been great catching up , mr. d. ,
but my friend just arrived .
i &apos;d introduce you ,
but you may or may not have
statutorily raped his sister .
might be a tad awkward .
consider this a warning .
stay away from serena . stay away from her family .
you wanna hang out ?
sorry , damien , but i &apos;m done with the pills , all right ?
no , as friends .
uh , sure . why not ?

a wise woman once said that every morning
when you wake up , you say a little prayer .
after all , you never know what your day may hold .
sorry , i only have an hour before my next meeting .
then we &apos;ve got no time to waste .
from a warm good @-@ bye ...
ten things i need done in an hour .
sorry . fashion week is starting .
... to a chilly hello .
you have no new messages .
from quiet solitude ...
... to surprise company .
hi . can i help you ?
hi . i &apos;m here for the home inspection .
inspection for what ?
ah , sorry we &apos;re late .
you must be ben &apos;s parole officer .
the day waits for no one .
better switch that thing off or bring it to bed .
vibration &apos;s a terrible thing to waste .
mm . sorry . that &apos;s my dad .
what ? i can &apos;t ignore his calls .
he &apos;s my boss , remember ?
how could i forget ?
don &apos;t move .
don &apos;t worry .
hi , dad . i &apos;m just running late .
i &apos;ll be right there .
i gotta go . rain check .
oh , no , no .
what &apos;s wrong ?
just lost the ace for the kickoff party .
have to find a replacement large enough
for florence and the machine to perform ,
call the caterers , reroute the flowers and the gift bags .
that sounds like my kind of crisis .
what can i do to help ?
stop distracting me with questions , for starters ,
and have you even finished your list ? that &apos;s a &quot; no . &quot;
so i guess in addition to everything else i have to do this week ,
i will spend your entire performance review tomorrow
discussing your inability
to finish your tasks in a timely fashion .
no . i can &apos;t tank my review .
this internship is everything , and i &apos;ve been working hard .
try to understand . epperly &apos;s under a lot of pressure .
oh , please , i &apos;ve celebrated more
fashion weeks than birthdays .
i know how it is .
my mother &apos;s very high @-@ strung .
in fact , in the years between her marriages ,
you wouldn &apos;t believe ... wait a minute .
how long do you think it &apos;s been
since epperly had her strings plucked ?
excuse me ?
well , there &apos;s no shame in it .
it &apos;s just what happens when you &apos;re married to your job .
it &apos;s hard for a powerful woman to find the time .
but maybe all i have to do is to get epperly on my back
is to get her on hers .
last time i checked the intern packet ,
i don &apos;t think &quot; pimp daddy &quot; was included
in the description of duties .
well , it just so happens that epperly &apos;s perfect partner
also owns the perfect hotel to host tonight &apos;s kickoff party .
ahh . two birds , one bass .
well , that &apos;s the grand tour--
bedrooms in the back , kitchen &apos;s in the front .
&apos;90s rock relics everywhere .
well , everything looks good .
ben , i &apos;ll see you at the end of the week , okay ?
this is a pretty great thing you and your family are doing .
so ... i really can &apos;t thank you enough , rufus ,
for letting me crash in your old room .
and , dan , i know this is a huge imposition ,
but i &apos;m gonna do my best to stay out of your hair .
if at any time you want me gone , i am .
i &apos;m sure it won &apos;t come to that . the parole board would rather
have you in a home setting . so would we .
hey , dad , can i talk to you for a second ?
i &apos;m gonna go unpack my stuff .
are you seriously letting
serena &apos;s stalker move in here ?
i told you last week this was a possibility .
well , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d actually do it ,
especially without talking to me first .
i didn &apos;t think i needed your approval .
after everything he &apos;s been through ,
don &apos;t you think we owe it to him ?
sure , if by &quot; we , &quot; you mean lily . why doesn &apos;t he just move
into chuck &apos;s old room ? and what do you plan on telling
serena about this ? i &apos;m sure she &apos;s not gonna be okay with it .
actually , she &apos;s more than okay with it . it was her idea .
hey . uh , i already got the tickets
and the ginger @-@ sesame @-@ caramel popcorn , so
yeah , i don &apos;t think i can make the movie today , man .
oh . um , all right , well , let &apos;s ...
we &apos;ll just grab a coffee then .
no . i think i gotta get out of town for a few days ,
maybe even longer .
since when ? why ?
since recently and for reasons i &apos;m not at liberty to discuss .
seriously ?
yeah .
oh , come on . you know you can trust me with anything .
i mean , the amount of crazy crap that people tell me
and expect me to keep to myself ,
all--all the drama about my mom and serena and ben ...
maybe that &apos;s the reason i can &apos;t tell you .
because it &apos;s about ben ?
damien , if you know something about him , you gotta tell me .
rufus just moved him into the loft .
ben &apos;s living with dan now . nice .
okay . the other morning , ben jumped me .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . he--he just went nuts .
told me if i didn &apos;t get lost ,
he was gonna tell my dad i was dealing .
you don &apos;t know my dad , eric . if he finds out , i am ... done .
okay , that &apos;s crazy .
i mean , if anyone should have to leave the city ,
it &apos;s--its ben , not you . that guy is dangerous ,
and i do not want him around my family or my friends .
look , don &apos;t go yet . i &apos;m gonna figure something out .
did i hear raina just leave ?
what is that , three days in a row now ?
things are getting serious .
not fast enough .
we &apos;re stuck in this meaningless mind @-@ blowing sex loop .
aw , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
raina &apos;s the one person that can stop her father
from swallowing up bass industries .
i need her to fall for me so she &apos;ll spare my company .
yeah , well , she doesn &apos;t strike me
as the love @-@ at @-@ first @-@ sight type , so just give it some time .
time is the one thing i don &apos;t have .
one of my corporate weasels informed me that their board
is voting tonight at 8 : 00 to approve the bid .
once that happens , bass industries is toast .
i need to up my game .
no pun intended .
hello ? anybody home ? epperly , meet my good friend chuck bass .
nice to meet you , mr. bass .
that &apos;s nate . chuck , we need a favor .
the magazine lost its space for the kickoff party tonight ,
and epperly and i both agree the empire
would be the perfect replacement .
sadly , the empire is spoken for , but the palace is available .
the palace ... would lend an air of old @-@ world sophistication
to the evening .
i &apos;d have to check with florence &apos;s manager .
do you have a stage ?
they &apos;ll have one by tonight .
okay . i can get behind that .
and that brings me to another point of business .
nate , would you show epperly the view from the roof ?
it &apos;s something you must see .
excellent idea . i need to speak to blair alone for a moment .
looks like our favorite upper east sinners
just found the answer to their prayers .
i need your help .
lucky for us ,
their road to heaven leads straight through hell .
hey . dorota told me you were here .
yeah , i came by to check on eric .
with my mom away , i knew he wouldn &apos;t run into her ,
but turns out he &apos;s gone , too . want a berry ?
oh , no , thanks .
i already had breakfast with my new roommate ben .
what were you thinking ?
that he deserves a second chance .
oh , to what , to drug you and leave you for dead
in a motel room again ?
that wasn &apos;t ben . that was juliet , and you know it .
and now she &apos;s off doing independent study somewhere ,
and i don &apos;t even think they talk anymore .
look , i understand that you feel badly about what happened
and what lily did , but you can &apos;t forget that this guy
spent the past six months out to get you .
ben was a good guy before all this happened ,
and if you kept an open mind , you &apos;d see that he still is .
you &apos;d see what i see .
oh . wow .
what ?
you have feelings for this guy .
no . not that it &apos;s any of your business .
it doesn &apos;t matter how i feel or don &apos;t feel about ben .
he &apos;s made it perfectly clear he wants nothing to do with me .
i haven &apos;t even heard from him since the &quot; w &quot; party .
yeah . i guess i &apos;m way off base .
serena , what &apos;s going on ?
two guys from newel just showed up here
with a bookcase from ms. van der woodsen ?
uh , i can explain . i &apos;ll be right there .
there you are . i have to go now . i &apos;ll call you later .
wh--
where &apos;s she going ?
to see ben .
that &apos;s not a good idea .
tell me about it . what do you mean ?
well , contrary to what rufus and serena believe ,
he hasn &apos;t changed . he beat up a friend of mine just last week .
we have got to get rid of this guy ,
show everybody how dangerous he is .
what can i do for you ?
epperly , my boss .
fashion week just started , so she &apos;s a stress case ,
but my performance review is tomorrow ,
and i need it to go well .
surely saving tonight
will earn you the gold star you crave .
no , it will calm her for a nanosecond
until she finds something else to stress about .
i believe that only one thing can relax epperly ,
and it &apos;s something that i can &apos;t give to her .
you need to turn that frown upside down
before she pulls out the grading pencil .
and you &apos;re just the man for the job .
i &apos;m not sure i am . i &apos;ve spent the last few weeks
trying every trick i know in the bedroom
to get raina to fall in love with me--
business reasons , of course . nothing seems to be working .
that &apos;s because that &apos;s how you win a guy &apos;s heart ,
not a girl &apos;s .
if you want raina to fall for you ,
you have to stop pulling on her drawstrings
and start pulling on her heartstrings .
and where are they located , exactly ?
in a common connection .
you and i bonded over a mutual love of scheming ...
and burlesque .
find something that you and raina both share .
let your guard down .
show her a side of you that no one else sees .
i ... hear girls love that .
open up , and she &apos;ll be forced to follow suit .
and once you hook her , reel her in , gut her emotionally
and throw the carcass overboard .
you really do have a gift .
so it &apos;s a deal .
if i &apos;m focused on raina ,
i can &apos;t expend energy on epperly .
that is not fair . i give you gold
and you can &apos;t spare two hours ?
think of her as an amuse @-@ bouche .
you were right , blair . the view is great up there .
it &apos;s so pretty .
nate ... i was just saying how you should
come with me and epperly to lunch .
yeah , sure , i &apos;ll go to lunch , as long as epperly doesn &apos;t mind .
no , i &apos;d love that .
so i &apos;m sure ben was a perfectly nice guy
when serena met him ,
but you lock anybody up for three years ...
yeah , for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
i &apos;ve seen every episode of &quot; oz . &quot;
that place can change a man .
all right , so where &apos;s this friend of yours ?
damien is your friend ?
just hear him out , all right ?
eric , the guy &apos;s a drug dealer .
who helped you and blair find juliet
as soon as he realized serna got hurt .
humphrey , personal differences aside ,
ben is dangerous .
we all know that . we need to work together
to expose him before it &apos;s too late .
no . no . my answer &apos;s &quot; no . &quot; i &apos;m not gonna team up with
the one guy i trust less than ben , and neither should you .
did you remember to add the prospectus ?
if i say no , will you stop asking me ?
the i &apos;s are dotted ,
and the t &apos;s have been crossed . we &apos;re ready .
we need a unanimous vote tonight , raina .
anything less ,
and the bass board will sense weakness and put up a fight .
speak of the devil .
russell .
you have a beautiful hotel here .
i was just taking a look around .
with raina by your side , of course . smile , shake hands ,
send a message to the bass board that thorpe enterprises
cares about the future of these properties .
set them at ease .
ah . i never thought of that .
okay , do i need to be here for this ?
you &apos;re right . where are my manners ?
if you &apos;d like the real tour , you can start with lunch
at our restaurant .
i , uh , have to get back to the office ,
but i think it &apos;s nice-- a bass and a thorpe
to be seen working together , breaking bread .
besides , there &apos;s nothing my daughter doesn &apos;t tell me .
shall we ?
oh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m so sorry . i just--i thought--
don &apos;t apologize .
just return it .
i already called the delivery guys .
i can return this , too .
i can &apos;t believe you remembered .
i remember everything you &apos;ve read to me .
in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i don &apos;t really let go of things so easily .
i guess i could use something to keep me company at night ,
but the bookshelf still goes .
i was about to go out and get some lunch .
you wanna join me ? i don &apos;t wanna raid
the humphreys &apos; pantry , but i &apos;m kinda starving .
well , i told the delivery guys i &apos;d be here ,
so why don &apos;t we order in , if that &apos;s okay with you ?
i know where the menu book is .
so , epperly ,
have you always worked in fashion ?
pretty much . after oxford , i worked at the met
for harold koda at the costume institute .
but more importantly , you were a power pilates instructor .
for one semester in ... college .
but it still counts . core strength lasts a lifetime .
this is epperly .
what do you think ?
she &apos;s cool .
uh @-@ huh . what else ?
she &apos;s smart , stressed about work .
where are you going with this ? whoa .
you need to sleep with her right away .
what ?
i need you to relieve all that pent @-@ up tension
before my first performance review tomorrow ,
and you better not be selfish , archibald .
you know what i mean .
a woman remembers .
this is why you &apos;ve been dragging me around ?
well ... what &apos;s the big deal ?
it &apos;s not like you haven &apos;t done it before .
just think of her as
younger , more flexible lady catherine .
trouble . florence is stuck at j.f.k.
because the machine &apos;s flight is delayed .
well , epperly , it &apos;s fine . we &apos;ll send another car .
why don &apos;t you two grab lunch ,
and i &apos;ll go get a jump on it at &quot; w &quot; ?
no , i need to deal with this myself .
i &apos;ll see you back at the office .
i wasn &apos;t that selfish , was i ? was i ?
you were right . lunch was pretty amazing .
you &apos;ll have to tell justin when you see him .
he &apos;s our executive chef .
thank you , daniel .
the service was impeccable as always .
thank you so much , mr. bass .
that &apos;s the third waiter you &apos;ve greeted .
chuck , i know you &apos;re trying to make me feel guilty
about buying the palace
and firing all these nice people ,
but business is business . you know that .
what &apos;s with the show ?
it &apos;s not a show . i actually grew up here .
other kids have neighbors and potlucks .
i have concierges and room service .
i know these people because they &apos;re my extended family .
i guess i shouldn &apos;t expect you to understand .
actually , i do .
when my mother abandoned us ,
my dad couldn &apos;t sleep in our house anymore .
so he moved us into the penthouse of the blake ,
and we never left .
nothing like being a guest in your own home .
let me take you out tonight .
there &apos;s a party here , then after maybe we can ...
some other night ?
i have a meeting i can &apos;t miss . in fact ...
oh , my god . i didn &apos;t realize the time .
i &apos;m gonna get my coat .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
okay , you have to try a shishito pepper .
absolutely not .
my mouth is still on fire from the spicy tuna roll .
now please pour me some tea before i literally start to cry .
okay , okay .
look , i &apos;m sorry that
i &apos;ve been how i &apos;ve been .
i just--i &apos;ve spent the last three years
blaming you for where i thought you put me .
and now here you are somewhere else that i put you .
is that a problem ?
no , actually .
i &apos;m beginning to think i &apos;m supposed to be here .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
i should get going .
what are you doing ?
leaving .
what is it gonna take
for you to see this is a dangerous situation ?
what is it gonna take for you to see it isn &apos;t ?
we &apos;re not dating , so if it &apos;s all the same ,
i don &apos;t need your permission or protection .
look , dan ,
i know you &apos;re just looking out for serena ,
and i understand your concern . i do .
but you have nothing to worry about .
i swear .
watch out , lonely boy .
your new roommate &apos;s moving in fast ,
but you &apos;re the one who &apos;s going to have to unpack his lies .
raina &apos;s remarkable .
i &apos;ve honestly never been with a girl
who understands me like she does .
no , today was just hard because i was showing her the palace .
i know pretty soon it &apos;s all gonna be gone .
it &apos;s the one place that still feels like home .
i thought raina would understand that .
no , i am so sorry , epperly .
i really thought that you and nate would hit it off .
no , of course it &apos;s not you .
no , don &apos;t blame yourself .
he said he thought you were beautiful .
he &apos;s just coming off a really crazy relationship , you know ?
no , i know . he &apos;s as smart
as he handsome , isn &apos;t he ?
don &apos;t push it . wrap it up .
oh . okay . well , i &apos;ll see you back at work , epperly
hey . i &apos;ll walk you to your car .
thanks .
you know , i think i might like to see this place at night .
honestly , it &apos;s your loss , archibald .
okay , so maybe i was too quick to say no about epperly .
but there &apos;s no harm in hanging out with her
at the party now , is there ?
no harm at all
hey , serena . look , i gotta run . i &apos;ll see you tonight , okay ? bye .
you &apos;re at home during the day with nate ? do i smell a scheme ?
no , i &apos;m just grabbing a quick bite
and a change of clothes for the party .
and you &apos;re not coming from school , are you ?
no . i saw ben .
he called me , and we had lunch ,
and ... i don &apos;t know .
i think there really might be something there .
am i crazy ? please don &apos;t say &quot; yes . &quot;
bad boys have never really been your thing ,
but damaged outsiders are a definite weakness .
what do you mean ?
he &apos;s from a different social class .
your mother hates him .
he hates your mother .
he &apos;s living in a loft in dumbo .
i knew ben before i ever met dan .
not my point .
just ask yourself this
is it ben or the idea of him ?
taking off . i &apos;ll see you later .
hey , uh , glasses -- middle shelf
salad plates -- bottom shelf .
that &apos;s the way it &apos;s been my entire life ,
which is how long i &apos;ve lived here ... with my family .
listen , man , i know you &apos;re not too thrilled
to have me staying here
picking up on that , huh ?
little bit .
look , when your dad offered me a place to stay ,
i had no idea that you were living here .
if you want me gone , don &apos;t rattle dishes .
just tell me .
i never meant for juliet to do what she did .
i &apos;ve even told her to give me some space .
well , maybe you should tell her again .
i saw she called you .
because it &apos;s my mom &apos;s birthday .
that &apos;s the only reason . like it or not ,
they &apos;re the only family i have . i &apos;m not gonna lose them .
but it &apos;s okay for serena to lose hers ?
she &apos;s already cutting herself off
from her mother and eric over what happened .
if you really cared about her , you wouldn &apos;t make her choose
between you or them .
yeah , &apos; cause that &apos;s what you did when you guys were together
are you saying you guys are together now ?
that &apos;s her , isn &apos;t it ?
hey .
hey . so i know it &apos;s last minute ,
but i was wondering if you wanted
to come with me to the &quot; w &quot; party tonight .
party ? tonight ?
you know , if you &apos;d asked me an hour ago ,
i would &apos;ve said that &apos;s not such a good idea .
but , uh ... you know what ? i &apos;m in .
great . i can &apos;t wait to see you .
你在哪
great news . nate is coming to the kickoff party tonight ...
and he &apos;s very excited to see you .
that &apos;s great . too bad i won &apos;t be there .
why not ?
moving the party has been a logistical nightmare ,
and my phone hasn &apos;t stopped ringing ,
and i can &apos;t miss a call .
cinderella doesn &apos;t always get to go to the ball .
well , she can if she has
all her calls forwarded to her blackberry
and an able intern by her side the whole time .
i &apos;m not saying to blow off your responsibilities .
but if anything goes wrong ,
how can you fix it from here ?
it &apos;s not a good idea .
you can still do your job and have a fabulous night
at the same time . nate can &apos;t wait to see you .
trust me . it &apos;s like riding a very cute bike .
all right , but we have to leave now . here &apos;s my phone .
do your forwarding magic .
different ringtones for different lines
careful , b
your boss &apos;s phone is ringing off the hook ,
and it &apos;s your job on the line .
there &apos;s nate . let &apos;s go say hi .
maybe i should go make sure the gift bags
are being set out properly .
i &apos;m sure that they &apos;re fine .
if anyone needs to reach you , you have your phone .
come on . look alive .
ladies . epperly , care to join me at the bar ?
go get her .
so you go to things like this every week ?
if you don &apos;t like it , we can leave .
i just thought the music would be good .
oh , no . i &apos;m--i &apos;m looking forward to it .
you thirsty ?
yes , please .
i missed my meeting .
was i worth it ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
i took the liberty of reserving my old suite .
perhaps after the show , we can continue your tour upstairs .
only on the condition that you show me something first ,
your hiding place from when you were a little boy .
did nate tell you ?
i grew up in a hotel , too , remember ?
so can i see it ?
it wouldn &apos;t be so secret if i just showed it to you .
fine . i guess i &apos;ll just have to find it myself .
whoa ! watch where you &apos;re going , man . watch where you &apos;re going !
damien , what are you ... doing here ?
this is a party . i go to these .
you--not so much .
i thought i told you to stay away from him .
or what ? huh ?
not here .
you name the place . i &apos;ll be there .
get out of my way .
that &apos;s not what we planned .
you said he had a short fuse .
damien baited ben . he just didn &apos;t bite .
eric said you met his parole officer ?
yeah . why ?
you should call him .
parolee &apos;s about to get violent at a private event .
to be clear , i &apos;m doing this for serena ,
snd if you turn out to be lying about ben ,
i will make sure that you never set foot in this town again .
understood .
i &apos;ll be back .
what &apos;s this for ?
your hand in about three minutes .
you &apos;re gonna punch me in the face as hard as you can .
blair , have you seen epperly ?
yes , and i can hear my performance review now .
check plus , check plus , check plus--
you don &apos;t understand .
the party planner delivered all the gift bags to the old location .
well , i &apos;m sure she can fix it . she &apos;s right over there .
i don &apos;t understand . where &apos;d she go ?
warmer ?
scalding .
excellent . under the table .
or ...
in the corner ...
by the shelf .
the corner-- how on earth did you know that ?
i hid in the same place .
you can see everyone , but no one can see you .
i even carved my name in the wall with a salad fork .
the old wood floor was replaced by tile in the last reno .
otherwise , i could &apos;ve shown you my work .
see ? i know you better than you know yourself .
i know how much the palace means to you .
it &apos;s your home .
i think i can keep you from losing it .
raina ...
before we go any further ,
there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
don &apos;t bother .
allow me .
dad , wh @-@ what are you doing here ?
i should ask you the same question .
how dare you miss the meeting .
i told you , we needed a unanimous vote .
i &apos;m sorry .
but i &apos;m not even sure
if we should buy bass industries anymore .
raina ... one of chuck &apos;s associates
called our chairman tonight .
chuck knew about the vote .
he kept you away on purpose .
is this true ?
no , i wish you guys could have seen it .
hey , ben , i want you to meet shala , humberto , and jen .
hi .
how are you ? humberto .
uh , look , i think i &apos;m gonna take off .
oh , i &apos;ll come with you .
no , you should stay . i mean , your family &apos;s here ...
eric , what are you doing here with ... damien ?
what happened to your face ?
ben . he threatened me earlier ,
and then he followed me to the bathroom , and then he jumped me .
eric , are you kidding me ? there &apos;s no way .
no , he did it . i saw it myself .
don &apos;t even try to deny it . i can see that look on your face .
sorry , s , your new beau may have the right to remain silent
but you just became the talk of the town .
i don &apos;t understand . it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
why would ben just come and hit you unprovoked ?
the guy &apos;s obviously got some serious anger issues .
and his parole officer just happened to be here ?
come on .
no , i called him .
because you knew that he &apos;d hit damien ?
because i knew he was a danger to you , to me ,
to anyone he came into contact with .
i tried to tell you all this , but you wouldn &apos;t listen to me .
because i don &apos;t believe it , and i don &apos;t believe you .
serena , wait .
wait .
did you really know our board meeting was tonight ?
tell me the truth .
yes .
raina , when we first met ,
i was so desperate to save my father &apos;s company .
i didn &apos;t care what it took , who i had to betray .
i thought if you fell for me ,
you might find a way to spare it .
but after spending today together ,
i realized how much i actually do care about you .
i &apos;m so sorry , chuck .
there &apos;s nothing you can ever say to make me trust you again .
my father &apos;s waiting for me .
i won &apos;t be able to get you in front of a judge till morning .
let me guess .
you &apos;re not springing for a room at this place .
this is serious , ben .
i &apos;d hoped for better from you .
wait ! stop . you &apos;re making a mistake .
serena , don &apos;t .
i know you didn &apos;t do anything .
tell him .
nate , where &apos;s epperly ?
we &apos;re having a gift bag crisis .
how should i know ?
she left with this guy she knew from oxford .
what ? how could you let some toff just punt off with her ?
he &apos;s definitely gonna try and hook up with her .
you should &apos;ve heard this guy &apos;s accent .
epperly was right .
you can &apos;t take your eye off the ball .
i need to fix this . let &apos;s go .
you are gonna help me get 650 gift bags
from 29th street in 20 minutes ,
or so help me , archibald ,
i will tell everyone what your favorite movie is .
hey , do not knock &quot; the sound of music . &quot;
it &apos;s got nuns and nazis .
julie andrews was hot .
so i say we go back to your place ,
pop in some &quot; call of duty &quot; and celebrate .
listen , man , i don &apos;t want you to take this the wrong way ,
but i think we &apos;re pretty much done here .
i don &apos;t understand . i ...
i thought we were ... friends .
you &apos;re my client .
former client , actually .
so you were just using me to find out where ben was
so you could get rid of me ?
and now he &apos;s gone , and so am i.
see ya .
you heard what happened ?
are you seriously mad at me now ?
well , i can &apos;t say i &apos;m entirely pleased .
you put max cady in my living room .
what was i supposed to do ?
i guess i didn &apos;t realize how deeply you felt about it .
i know you got a lot on your plate right now .
it &apos;s gotta be hard for you to be caught in the middle like this .
well , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t ask you first .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
uh , you were .
ben didn &apos;t hit damien . i @-@ i did .
oh , my god .
spotted--a lonely boy trying to save an innocent man .
looks like brooklyn &apos;s the one who &apos;s guilty ... by association .
hey , have you talked to eric ?
he wasn &apos;t here when i got up .
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised
if he was off somewhere with damien .
i don &apos;t know what to do , how to get through to him .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i &apos;m meeting with nate . we &apos;re gonna take care of it .
uh , i &apos;ve gotta call you back .
i don &apos;t know where to begin .
how about &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; ?
i didn &apos;t think that would be enough .
i &apos;m pretty easy .
well , then i &apos;m sorry .
honestly , i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
i was jealous . i was angry .
i cost you a night in jail .
what &apos;s one more after three years ?
thank you for calling my p.o. , setting the record straight .
i &apos;ll pack up my stuff .
no , you don &apos;t have to move out . in fact ,
i would like you to stay .
i realize you &apos;re someone i should trust ,
just like serena said i should .
she said that ?
yeah . if you don &apos;t believe me ,
you can ask her yourself .
hey . dan invited me to come over and wait for you .
she was right . i was wrong .
just give everyone else some time . they &apos;ll come around .
i need to go meet nate .
where have you been ?
i was just getting coffee at sicaff ?
i @-@ i got you one , too .
you should know that , um , dan and nate
are on their way over to damien &apos;s to look for you .
yeah , well , damien ditched me after the party , so ...
strongest drug i &apos;m on is double macchiato .
are we done ?
no , no , no . we &apos;re not .
talk to me . make me understand
why you wanna spend so much time with a guy like him
when you have all your other friends .
what other friends ?
can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna say this out loud .
it sounds so stupid , but i ... i thought damien got me .
you know , we could just hang out together
and do nothing .
he was there for me .
that kind of a guy always is .
lesson learned . thank you .
你欠我的
for what ?
a speechless chuck bass .
will wonders never cease ?
honestly , i never thought you &apos;d talk to me again .
neither did i.
but then i got a phone call from your friend blair .
not a staged call-- a real one .
she told me you may have said all those things
on the phone with her for the wrong reasons ...
but that you also meant them .
when it comes to me , blair has a nasty habit
of never being wrong .
she said the same thing .
so i &apos;ve decided to ignore my better judgment
and give you a second chance . if you ever lie to me again--
you have my word . business is business .
you need to do what &apos;s right for thorpe enterprises .
i &apos;ll find another way to save my family legacy--
one that doesn &apos;t involve you .
i would ...
but i can &apos;t right now . i have a meeting .
dinner tonight ?
room service .
谢谢你
epperly &apos;s been in with stefano for over an hour .
but ... it was just gift bags .
and we still got them there on time .
this is all my fault .
i wanted epperly to get laid , not laid off .
did you get fired ?
of course not . the party was a huge success .
are you having a psychotic break ?
no , but i am taking a break . i quit .
blair , at the party , i ran into the guy
that i dated when i was living in london ,
and we spent the whole night together--just talking .
and he is heading off to bali to a yoga retreat ,
and i ... decided i want to go with him .
you &apos;re leaving the magazine
for &quot; eat pray love &quot; ?
i guess you can &apos;t have it all .
no , of course you can . don &apos;t quit .
you &apos;re amazing at your job .
i know , and you will be , too .
what ?
as a token of my appreciation
for helping me see what was missing in my life ,
i suggested that you be promoted to replace me . congratulations .
stefano &apos;s giving you a trial run , starting now .
this is the office , international , stefano only .
now your day begins every morning at 6 : 00 a.m.
with the milan conference call .
no , no , i am a full @-@ time student . i go to columbia .
if james franco can do it , so can you .
blair , you wanted it all , and you just got it .
they say the universe has a great sense of humor ,
that sometimes having your dreams come true
can feel like a nightmare .
the board is waiting for us .
raina , after last night , i need to ask
if i have your full support to buy bass industries .
yes , under one condition .
name it .
after the deal closes , i want you to give chuck
a chance to be part of the new company .
i don &apos;t need chuck &apos;s help to run bass industries .
yes , you do .
you just don &apos;t know it yet .
because getting what you want
always comes with strings attached .
archibald , humphrey . what are you guys doing here ?
well , we came looking for eric .
we ran into your dad instead . he &apos;s a nice guy .
i mean , at least he was to us .
how he is to you after what we told him
might be a different story .
wait . you guys realize what you &apos;ve done ?
my dad &apos;s gonna cut me off !
and even when you think you &apos;re finally in the clear ,
you &apos;re never home free .
you haven &apos;t slept .
i couldn &apos;t ,
not until i knew you were safe .
last night at the party when everyone else doubted you ,
i never did , not for a second , and i never will .
what about your family ?
what if us being together drives them all away ?
i don &apos;t think it will ,
but that &apos;s a risk i &apos;m willing to take if you are .
every happy ending is just a new beginning ...
because on the upper east side ,
the good times never last forever .
