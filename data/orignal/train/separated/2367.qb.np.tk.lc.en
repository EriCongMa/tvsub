you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
klaus is a vampire born of a werewolf bloodline .
the curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting .
but if he breaks it ,
he &apos;ll be a true hybrid .
klaus wanted me to deliver a message .
the sacrifice happens tonight .
the ritual itself is relatively straight forward .
a witch will channel the power of the full moon
to release the spell that &apos;s bound within the stone .
after that , klaus ,
being both werewolf and vampire ,
will sacrifice one of each .
and where do i fit into it ?
klaus must drink the blood of the doppelganger
to the point of your death .
i can &apos;t lose you .
you won &apos;t .
there is another way .
damon , no !
she &apos;ll come back a vampire !
how could you take that choice away from her ?
she &apos;ll never forgive you .
a bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire .
so don &apos;t be his friend . do you understand me ?
tyler ?
without the werewolf ,
he can &apos;t perform the ritual tonight .
first rule--
always have a back @-@ up .
back @-@ up werewolf .
back @-@ up vampire .
she &apos;s in transition .
why didn &apos;t he use me ?
he couldn &apos;t .
what is this , damon ?
a werewolf bite .
caroline , let me help !
get back , i got it !
caroline , the door &apos;s not going to hold .
come on !
tyler , please !
matt ! no .
hey , no ! it &apos;s tyler !
it &apos;s trying to kill us !
wait !
he &apos;s wounded .
caroline , stay back .
we can go around him .
are you nuts ?
you &apos;re not going to shoot him again , ok ? ok .
matt , take my hand .
i got it .
matt , take my hand .
so that &apos;s what a werewolf bite looks like .
yep . it &apos;s not that bad .
will be .
so that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re just ...
gonna die ?
well , that depends . you know anything about a cure ?
me , either .
145 years and no last good @-@ bye ?
you don &apos;t get a good @-@ bye .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t leave mad .
us ending on up on good terms
isn &apos;t exactly on my bucket list , katherine .
klaus made me call jenna to lure her out .
there was nothing that i could do . i didn &apos;t have a choice .
that &apos;s why i gave you the vervain .
so you had a choice .
it was her or me . i chose her .
i helped you . you owed me .
now when klaus dies ,
you &apos;re going to walk out of here without a scratch
and elena &apos;s aunt dies .
somehow you &apos;re the only one that wins .
how &apos;d that happen ?
i didn &apos;t let love get in the way .
enjoy eternity alone , katherine .
what are you going to do ?
i &apos;m going to offer myself as a replacement to klaus .
he won &apos;t take you .
he saw your bite ,
he said that your blood is impure .
i &apos;m sorry , damon .
but jenna &apos;s dead ,
there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
oh , my head .
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
do you remember what happened ?
you called me .
you were so scared .
oh , ah , i should have realized that it wasn &apos;t you .
the second i walked out of the house ,
someone grabbed me .
a vampire .
klaus .
it was klaus .
he made me drink his blood .
and i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t remember anything after that .
where are we ? what happened ?
we &apos;re at the quarry .
he brought us here .
why don &apos;t i remember anything ?
jenna , do you remember ...
when i told you
how someone becomes a vampire ?
yeah , if you die
with vampire blood in your system ,
it &apos;s ...
oh , god .
he killed me .
jenna , listen to me .
listen to me , everything &apos;s going to be ok .
i &apos;m going to get you out of here .
i &apos;m a vampire ?
and i bet you &apos;re hungry .
don &apos;t bother trying to get through .
i spelled the circle . you &apos;re trapped .
no matter what you do .
greta ...
please , just-- just let her go .
klaus chose her .
drink it .
jenna , don &apos;t !
i can &apos;t .
let her go . hey !
no !
that &apos;s enough .
jenna , it &apos;s going to be ok .
look at me . hey , look at me .
it &apos;s gonna be ok . it &apos;s gonna be ok .
this is useless .
all these grimoires .
there has to be something in here to keep elena
from becoming a vampire .
and we &apos;ll keep looking .
until the last minute .
the sacrifice is completed in stages as the full moon sets .
first the werewolf is killed , then the vampire .
finally the doppelganger .
once elena dies , the curse will be broken .
klaus will become hybrid .
so when do we attack ?
elena &apos;s death will activate his dormant werewolf side .
he &apos;ll be vulnerable during the transformation .
that &apos;s when bonnie comes in .
and you &apos;re sure bonnie will survive this ?
if she can deliver him to the brink of death ,
i &apos;ll finish the job myself .
damon .
you &apos;re not going to like what i &apos;m about to say .
cut to the chase . is the sacrifice happening or not ?
it &apos;s happening .
i tried to stop it , but it got ... complicated .
we &apos;re sticking with the original plan .
we &apos;re meeting bonnie right now .
he &apos;s got jenna , stefan .
what ?
he &apos;s got kathrine to lure her out of the house .
what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ?
he &apos;s going to use her as the vampire in the ritual .
oh , my god .
how are you feeling ?
i feel like myself ... only not .
everything is brighter .
the fire &apos;s hotter .
part of me is terrified ,
but there &apos;s another part
of me that doesn &apos;t want to feel anything .
vampires can turn off the part that &apos;s human .
that &apos;s the part that hurts .
i &apos;m gonna die , aren &apos;t i ?
no !
jenna , i &apos;m not going to let that happen .
i don &apos;t care what i have to do .
who &apos;s that ?
that must be the werewolf .
what &apos;s happening to me ?
i cast a spell to slow down your transformation .
your insides are trying to tear themselves free .
greta , witches are supposed to maintain the balance in nature .
it &apos;s your duty to them to keep your curse sealed .
my duty is to klaus !
the new order .
glad to know i still have a dance partner .
hello , my lovelies .
are we ready ?
come on , get in here !
do you see anything ?
we &apos;re not safe here .
if that thing wants in , it &apos;s getting in .
how did you even know what i was ?
i compelled you to forget !
i was on vervain .
i faked forgetting so i could spy on you .
it was your mom &apos;s idea .
wait , my mom knows ? !
oh , my god . you told her .
well , what &apos;d she say ?
your mom hates vampires . she grew up hating vampires .
she &apos;ll probably always hate vampires .
well , what about you ?
what about me ?
where does this leave us ?
stuck in this house .
trying not to get mauled to death by our friend .
heard ya .
great . i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat .
elena hasn &apos;t returned any of my calls for days .
i need to see her .
well , you &apos;re a day late and a daughter short , john .
what are you talking about ?
klaus has her . sacrifice goes down tonight .
how could you let that happen ?
you were supposed to keep her safe .
wasn &apos;t that the sum total of your plan to keep her safe ?
she is safe . i fed her my blood .
you what ? !
when klaus kills elena
in the sacrifice , she will come back to life .
granted as the thing you hate most in the world ,
but no one really cares what you think .
you do not want to mess with me right now .
you ruined her life . you know that , right ?
i know , john .
i took her choice , destroyed her future .
trust me , i get it .
it actually gets worse .
how could it possibly get any worse ?
i &apos;ve got the moon stone .
i spent 500 years looking for this .
i hate to part with it .
the moon has passed its apex .
remember everything you need to do ?
i remember .
everything i did ...
i was just trying to help tyler .
are you jules ?
i didn &apos;t want him to be alone !
shall we ?
try reading .
emily bennett &apos;s ,
this is a section on spells she did
for my ancestor johnathan gilbert .
yeah , i think she had a thing for him .
there &apos;s something on a resuscitative spell she was working on .
i saw that , too .
she just didn &apos;t explain what it did , exactly .
maybe johnathan wrote about it in his journals .
you know , i can have stefan bring them .
someone &apos;s here .
hey , what are you doing here ?
elijah and stefan are upstairs .
you mind if i have a second with jeremy ?
sure , yeah . of course .
what &apos;s the matter ?
jeremy ...
something &apos;s happened to jenna .
why did he take jenna ?
a punishment for meddling .
klaus was going to use tyler and caroline .
but damon rescued them .
then we need to go .
now . before jenna &apos;s been sacrificed .
i can kill klaus myself .
bonnie ...
if you use that much power , you &apos;ll be dead .
we &apos;ve already been through this .
it &apos;s not an option .
neither is letting jenna die .
well , stefan would agree with you .
we &apos;re going to offer another vampire .
one that he &apos;ll want more .
me .
tell me it &apos;s working .
it &apos;s working .
the day that the lawyers called to tell me
that i was going to become your guardian ,
you know what my first thought was ?
isn &apos;t there someone else who can do this ?
jenna , there was no one else
who could have gotten me and jeremy through all of that .
it &apos;s just the thought that i almost passed up taking care of you .
but you didn &apos;t .
you put your entire life
on hold to help us .
look around , elena .
i failed you .
no .
you didn &apos;t . i failed you .
i &apos;m so sorry .
listen .
being a vampire , it intensifies your guilt .
but it also makes you stronger and faster .
you can fight back .
i &apos;m gonna get through this . i &apos;ll be ok .
i need you to believe that .
promise me ,
when you get the chance ...
run .
ok .
you don &apos;t think i killed him , do you ?
no .
no . it takes a lot more than wooden bullets
to kill a werewolf .
he &apos;s still out there somewhere .
do you think my mom wants to kill me ?
i don &apos;t think your mom knows what to do with you .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t really know what to do with me , either .
what is it ?
wait .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t shoot .
what the hell are you doing ?
give me your that .
what ?
your jacket , take it off .
caroline .
it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
bonnie did a locator spell .
they &apos;re at steven &apos;s quarry .
i &apos;ll head over there first
and you &apos;ll follow with bonnie when it &apos;s time .
just as the moon hits its final phase .
she &apos;s to stay hidden until then .
he cannot know that she &apos;s alive .
you &apos;re very honorable .
are you ?
because this whole plan is , um ,
it &apos;s contingent upon your honor , elijah .
i won &apos;t fail you .
klaus is your brother .
i know i &apos;ve wanted to kill my brother a thousand times .
i &apos;ve never been able to .
well , klaus was not my only brother .
i had siblings ;
parents . i had a family .
over the centuries , klaus hunted them down one by one
and he took them from me .
he scattered them across the seas
where their bodies couldn &apos;t be found .
you want revenge .
sometimes there &apos;s honor in revenge , stefan .
i won &apos;t fail you .
please end this .
i brought the gilbert journals .
i think i know the spell you &apos;re talking about .
where &apos;s damon ?
upstairs . alaric wanted to talk to him .
he did what ? !
he wasn &apos;t going to let jenna die .
we have a witch .
she kills klaus .
no one has to die !
except for bonnie .
god , stefan , damn it !
hey , are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
well , that &apos;s my brother for you .
always cleaning up my messes .
hello , jenna .
let her go .
i understand that i have to die , but she doesn &apos;t !
careful .
elena , don &apos;t .
no , jenna !
we can &apos;t leave jeremy without a family .
i followed your rules , i did everything that you asked .
i didn &apos;t run . please .
well , well .
i don &apos;t recall you being on the guest list .
i &apos;m here to talk .
very well , then .
what can i do for you , mr. salvatore ?
we found something in the gilbert journals .
johnathan journaled the story of a mother
who called on emily &apos;s services .
the woman &apos;s baby was sick ; dying .
emily cast a spell that
would bind a woman &apos;s life force with her child .
skip to the save elena part .
well , the child died , but the mother &apos;s life force
flowed through her , restoring her to life .
we already know elena &apos;s going to come back to life .
she &apos;ll be a vampire .
not if her soul remains intact .
her soul , really ?
you &apos;re going to put your faith in some act of god mumbo jumbo ?
i refuse to let elena become the thing
i &apos;ve spent my life protecting her against .
and you can call that god or mystical energy ,
whatever you want , but yes ...
i &apos;m putting my faith in it .
what &apos;s going on ?
i--i don &apos;t know .
you can hear them .
you can hear anything .
just focus on them .
you don &apos;t need to kill jenna .
i &apos;ll take her place .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
i rather appreciate the symmetry of three women--
three goddesses--
sacrificed at nature &apos;s altar .
what are they saying ?
i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t make it out .
you can do this . just relax . focus .
don &apos;t play games with me .
you &apos;ll get what you want .
i can hear him . i hear stefan .
what are they saying ?
you &apos;re quite the hero , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ve heard that about you .
just make the trade .
me for jenna .
oh , my god .
what is it ?
he wants to take my place .
how &apos;s tyler doing ?
sleeping .
he should better by morning .
he just ... he needs some rest .
good .
so this is your life now , huh ?
never a dull moment .
you know , these last few days with you have been
so great , and fun .
and so caroline .
i--i thought that i might be able
to get past this whole vampire thing .
but you can .
matt ...
i don &apos;t know if i can , caroline .
matt !
i get it . this is your life now .
you know what my life is , car ?
my life is an absentee mom .
and a bunch of bills to pay ,
and school , and a job ,
and it sucks sometimes .
but it &apos;s my life .
and ...
i think that i just want to live it without all of this .
come on , bonnie , we got a hybrid to kill .
it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s it ?
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ll be back soon .
wait , what do you mean ?
no , i &apos;m coming . i need to be there .
i need to make sure you guys are ok .
and who &apos;s going to make sure you &apos;re ok ?
i &apos;ve got my own ring .
look , i &apos;m not taking no for an answer .
easy ... easy
just go . i &apos;ll stay with him .
it &apos;s time .
all right .
i got the weapons in the car .
bonnie &apos;s the only weapon we need .
bonnie ! what is this ?
i can &apos;t put anyone else at risk .
i can &apos;t stay here with jenna out there !
i &apos;m sorry .
you can &apos;t do this ! damon ?
sorry , buddy . she &apos;s right .
no ! you can &apos;t do this .
bonnie !
bonnie !
elena ...
i have to do something .
this can &apos;t happen . none of it .
quite the predicament .
you know , it &apos;s funny ,
all this talk about preserving family ,
and here &apos;s stefan ,
granting your wish .
stefan ...
it &apos;s okay .
well .
who &apos;s it going to be , elena ?
no .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
there &apos;s actually no choice .
aahh ! no ! stefan !
no !
i have other plans for your boyfriend .
i want him alive .
but for now ...
whenever you &apos;re ready , greta .
no .
your turn .
no , jenna , no !
it &apos;s over , elena .
i know what i have to do .
jenna
just turn it off .
jenna .
turn it off .
you won &apos;t be scared anymore .
no ! jenna !
no ! jenna !
no .
i &apos;m so sorry .
are they going to kill him ?
yes .
it &apos;s time .
thank you , elena .
ah , go to hell .
no .
i can feel it .
it &apos;s happening .
yes , yes !
no !
you were dead !
wake up , elena !
i need you to get her out of here !
what about you ?
i &apos;m not leaving until he &apos;s dead .
go .
elijah ?
hello , brother .
in the name of our family , niklaus ...
i didn &apos;t bury them at sea !
their bodies are safe .
if you kill me , you &apos;ll never find them .
elijah !
don &apos;t listen to him .
elijah .
i can take you to them .
i give you my word ... brother .
do it and i &apos;ll take you both out .
you &apos;ll die .
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m sorry .
no !
no !
we should have heard from them by now .
did you read all this ?
i did .
so you understand what happened to the child &apos;s mother
after the baby was brought back to life .
she saved her daughter .
she found peace .
john ...
i need you to give this to elena for me .
and also this .
oh , hey , what &apos;s going on ?
take care of each other .
please .
i think they &apos;re here !
if you come back as a vampire ,
i &apos;ll stake you myself .
so don &apos;t do it .
because i can &apos;t stand the idea of you hating me forever .
how is she ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
what about jenna ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry , jeremy .
elena !
what happened ?
how do you feel ?
i feel fine .
ooh , yeah , you got shot .
but it &apos;s healing .
you were right .
i shouldn &apos;t have come home .
no , you just ...
should have never left .
and you shouldn &apos;t leave again .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
this is the second time i &apos;ve tried to kill you .
well , no friendship is perfect .
matt broke up with me .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , well , you know ,
instead of just bailing on me again ,
you could just say ...
&quot; thank you , caroline ,
&quot; for taking care of me .
and i &apos;m sorry that i tried to chow down on you again . &quot;
come here .
ohh . easy .
thank you , caroline .
for taking care of me .
you &apos;re welcome .
we all set ?
yeah .
plenty of room with the gilbert family plot ,
and i compelled two of the grave diggers
to do the dirty work .
how &apos;s she doing ?
she lost the only parents she had .
she &apos;s in shock .
i &apos;m almost ready .
take your time .
john wanted me to give you this .
and this .
jeremy ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry that you &apos;ve lost so many people .
i still have you .
&quot; elena ...
&quot; it &apos;s no easy task being an ordinary parent
&quot; to an extraordinary child .
&quot; i failed in that task .
and because of my prejudices , i failed you . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m haunted by
&quot; how things might have played out differently
if i &apos;d been more willing to hear your side of things . &quot;
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the end .
&quot; for you , a chance to grow old and someday do better
&quot; with your own child than i did with mine .
it &apos;s for that child that i give you my ring . &quot;
&quot; i don &apos;t ask for your forgiveness
&quot; or for you to forget .
&quot; i ask only that you believe this .
&quot; whether you are now reading this as a human
&quot; or as a vampire ,
&quot; i love you all the same .
&quot; as i &apos;ve always loved you , and always will .
john . &quot;
we &apos;re going to head back to the house .
i think i &apos;ll skip the coffee and tea cakes .
damon , she needs us right now .
all of us .
and then what &apos;s the plan , stefan ?
the curse is broken .
how does one go about killing
an all @-@ powerful wolf vamp
and his two @-@ faced older brother ?
i have no idea .
you need to get an idea . fast .
i &apos;m not going to let elena lose anybody else .
i wouldn &apos;t make any promises , brother .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
tyler lockwood bit me .
it &apos;s actually more of a nip , really ,
but there it is .
we &apos;ll find something .
a cure .
there &apos;s no cure , stefan .
we kept elena human , right ?
we found the way when there was no way .
i will do this .
you want to do something for me ?
keep this from elena .
