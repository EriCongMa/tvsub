第五季第十二集
your honor , the defendants ,
howard lampe and darla riggs ,
conspired to transport and deliver cocaine
on a flight from rio this past july .
they should be tried together because
they committed this crime together .
no , they are accused of committing this crime together .
it would prejudice my client to be tried alongside mr. lampe .
and my client alongside ms. riggs .
your honor , all of the prosecution witnesses
are common to both mr. lampe and ms. riggs .
it is the height of insanity to force
these witnesses to testify in two separate trials .
yes , we understand the inconvenience ...
this isn &apos;t about inconvenience . this is about a costly outlay ...
that is a small price to pay for what this trial should be .
it &apos;s an injustice , your honor . that seems petty ...
thank you ... all .
my concern , counselors ,
is that severance of the two trials was not requested
in a timely fashion .
yes , your honor ,
the circumstances of the defense have changed .
and what circumstances are those ?
our firm has since ...
two months ago , your ...
our firm has since ...
two months ago ...
go .
well , thank you .
when we originally represented the two defendants ,
we were one firm acting in concert ,
but mrs. florrick poached our clients ...
oh , we didn &apos;t poach anyone .
what would you call it ?
so , you want to sever your two cases
because you are now two law firms ?
yes , your honor .
it &apos;s in the best interest of our clients .
mr. lampe , ms. riggs , you agree with this ?
uh , yeah , yeah , we think it &apos;s for the best .
yes , your honor .
since the defendants are entitled to separate trials ,
i have no choice but to grant a severance .
thank you , your honor .
but i am severing cases , not courtrooms .
it will be a double jury trial .
a double ... ? uh , judge , i don &apos;t think that that ...
your honor , two juries will complicate our prosecution .
yes . that is understandable .
but i am a staunch advocate of judicial efficiency .
and you two counselors will just have to act in concert again .
we will commence jury selection this afternoon . thank you .
are you all right ?
yeah . you ?
i &apos;m good .
i love you .
i love you .
i heard .
so this should be interesting .
which ? working alongside will , or a double jury ?
oh , yeah , a double jury .
uh ... i &apos;ll first chair .
what ? why ?
calm things down , keep it from getting too emotional .
i won &apos;t get emotional .
we &apos;re on the same side on this .
not you . will .
keep him from getting emotional .
okay . you first chair .
it was sent as an anonymous tip
to anne stevens , the tribune reporter .
i &apos;ve never seen this before in my life .
the tip said ,
&quot; here is evidence of peter florrick stealing an election .
happy hunting . &quot;
are they running it ?
no . i got a two @-@ week delay .
i had to trade for it .
give &apos; em our pension rollout .
who is that ? is that someone you know ?
no .
yes . it &apos;s jim moody ,
my fixer during the campaign .
what ?
i didn &apos;t ask him to do anything .
wait . no one say anything .
mr. governor , it is in your best interest to
not talk to eli at this time .
everything being said now ,
everything that was just discussed ,
we &apos;ll have to repeat at some point to federal investigators .
well , that was the shortest honeymoon period in history .
one month as a governor .
we don &apos;t even know what this is , mr. governor .
what we &apos;re seeing is a ballot box .
it could be anything .
no . our lawyers argued in court
that it was a stuffed ballot box .
then we found out that the 30,000 votes were for peter .
who was the lawyer who argued in court ?
i &apos;ll have to question them .
alicia .
your wife ?
30,000 votes .
you don &apos;t steal an election with 30,000 votes .
we won by eight points !
okay . we can &apos;t discuss this anymore .
eli , i &apos;ll need to question you first .
i &apos;ll be right there .
you can &apos;t be talking .
it &apos;s not about this .
we all know the maxim , but it &apos;s true .
&quot; it &apos;s not the crime , it &apos;s the cover @-@ up . &quot;
marilyn , there is no cover @-@ up .
but for me to run this state ,
i need to be able to talk to my chief of staff alone .
very well .
who &apos;s the tipster ? moody ?
no , no . he &apos;s a soldier . he gets it .
someone at lockhart / gardner ?
why ?
will gardner came to my hotel suite
on election day to show me a video .
damn it .
i refused to look at it .
there is a lot of hate for us over there these days .
diane ?
no . it doesn &apos;t seem like her .
will could be out of his mind .
keep tabs on her .
already on it .
this is crazy .
good afternoon .
good afternoon to you , too .
first chair ?
yup .
here we go .
... experiences or opinions you might have
about the subject matter of this case ?
uh , no .
no objections for this juror , your honor .
no objections .
thank you , ma &apos;am . you may be seated .
actually , ma &apos;am ,
not that jury .
the folding @-@ chair jury .
uh , sorry , your honor .
is this for the darla riggs jury ?
it is .
we &apos;d like to exercise our peremptory challenge .
so she &apos;s all right for the howard lampe jury ,
but not ours ?
we don &apos;t have to explain our preemptory challenge .
thank you for your service today .
sure .
when there is a disagreement in a relationship
between a man and a woman ,
do you think it &apos;s better for the man to decide , or the woman ?
well , it &apos;s probably better if the guy does ,
just &apos; cause someone has to .
and if the guy did decide , would you ...
excuse me .
... blame the woman for his decision ?
your honor , we object to this question .
your honor , it &apos;s not their place to object .
they &apos;re part of the defense .
this is utter ...
so , our jury pool can be tainted but yours can &apos;t ?
and do you think it &apos;s possible
that women can use their looks to manipulate men ?
oh , sure .
it happens all the time at school .
and should the man be held responsible
if he &apos;s misled by the woman ?
oh , come on .
your honor , seriously ?
is that an objection ?
i don &apos;t hear an objection .
i object to your entire voir dire .
you &apos;re acting in an adversarial ...
they &apos;re coming after us .
we need everything you dug up on howard lampe .
i don &apos;t have anything .
i thought this was a collaborative defense .
we &apos;ve changed our minds .
it &apos;s a double jury , and they &apos;re using it against us .
we need any dirt on lampe , and we need it fast .
okay .
we have a chance to peel another client away .
from lockhart / gardner ? who ?
the paisley group .
how do you know ?
i have a friend who &apos;s an assistant there ,
and they &apos;re feeling ignored by lockhart / gardner .
mr. gardner cancelled too many meetings .
great , let &apos;s get a plan together .
and , um , robyn , get anything you can on darla riggs .
our codefendant ? why ?
&apos;cause they &apos;re doing the same .
haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
yeah , it &apos;s been tough .
oh , come on , cary .
look , just give me one second .
please ?
a second .
uh ... i &apos;m sorry .
for ?
for things ending poorly between us .
you &apos;re forgiven . anything else ?
yeah , you &apos;re being a douche .
things are kind of busy here , kalinda .
each jury should concern itself only with evidence
pertaining to its defendant .
you will not consult with the other jury .
i realize these are cramped quarters ,
but we &apos;re all going to have to make do .
please inform the court if you have any questions
or concerns by raising your hand .
uh , yes , sir .
do we have to sit in the folding chairs the entire time ?
yes ,
if that &apos;s where you &apos;ve been empanelled .
but the other jury gets to sit in the box in the good chairs ?
okay . perhaps we can alternate .
why do we have to alternate ?
you already said that we get the jury box .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
everybody calm down .
i have decided that we will alternate .
we began surveilling mr. lampe and ms. riggs
once they entered the customs area .
why did you monitor them , officer sorrento ?
when a couple getting off a plane from brazil
doesn &apos;t look organic , alarm bells go off .
and the defendants didn &apos;t look like an organic couple ?
could you explain ?
well , uh , mr. lampe looked like a professor .
and , uh , ms. riggs , she was , um , very pretty .
anything else suggest they might be transporting drugs ?
yes . mr. lampe was sweating profusely ,
and ms. riggs was staring down at her feet .
a search revealed a stash of two pounds of cocaine .
thank you , officer .
i tender the witness .
officer sorrento , were you aware that ms. riggs and
mr. lampe met and fell in love at rio &apos;s cinque terre resort
the previous week ?
no .
so , this nervous behavior that you observed
could be attributable to the fact
that mr. lampe had invited his new girlfriend home
for the weekend ?
or to the $ 100,000 in drugs in his carry @-@ on .
if the drugs were found in mr. lampe &apos;s carry @-@ on ,
why did you arrest ms. riggs ?
well , a search of ms. riggs revealed $ 30,000 on her person .
so you have a circumstantial case that the defendants conspired ?
yes . based on my investigation .
which yielded no direct evidence that ms. riggs participated
in mr. lampe &apos;s scheme ...
objection . assumes facts not in evidence .
sustained .
i will rephrase .
you have no direct evidence
that ms. riggs had access to mr. lampe &apos;s bag ?
that &apos;s correct .
okay . they &apos;re coming after us .
officer , you said that my client was carrying the bag .
meaning you concluded it was his bag , right ?
yes .
footage from the galeao airport in rio
confirmed the bag was in the sole possession of mr. lampe ...
are you aware that ms. riggs had reached her two carry @-@ on limit
and had given mr. lampe her bag to transport ?
the bag had no name tag .
but you assumed it was mr. lampe &apos;s , right ?
but it &apos;s possible that mr. lampe was an unwitting mark
in a smuggling scheme engineered ...
objection . calls for speculation .
sustained .
your honor , we are codefendants here .
ms. lockhart can &apos;t object .
he sustained your objection to our questioning .
yeah , which was a mistake .
excuse me , your honor .
i &apos;m not gonna allow mr. agos to criticize this ...
mr. gold , is the man
in this surveillance photo mr. jim moody ?
as far as i can tell , yes .
did you order
mr. moody to perform these actions ?
no , i did not .
did you ever hint to mr. moody
that he should do something illegal
regarding the ballot boxes ?
yes ?
that &apos;s too broad .
what part ?
did i ever hint ?
you &apos;re saying you did hint ?
no , i &apos;m saying the answer to a question like that
could lead to misunderstandings .
eli , we have to be honest with each other .
marilyn , i make 800 decisions a day .
during a campaign , it &apos;s twice that many .
i can not micro @-@ manage
every person i give a direction to .
there &apos;s not enough time .
i give them a direction ,
then let them exercise their creativity
in accomplishing that ... direction .
and is &quot; creativity &quot; a euphemism for &quot; illegality &quot; ?
no .
what direction did you give jim moody
that he might have exercised his creativity to do that ?
i said we were short of votes in the 12th precinct ,
and we needed to get out the vote .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with saying &quot; get out the vote . &quot;
there &apos;s a chance ...
i said we needed to do whatever we could .
but i would insist that is my manner .
i am absolutist in my encouragement ...
toward my underlings .
here &apos;s the problem , eli .
if mr. moody believes you encouraged him
to stuff that ballot box , your words are problematic .
i did not order him .
will mr. moody back you up on that ?
sorry , i have to pack for a red @-@ eye tonight .
after court .
oh , that &apos;s all right , ms. barrett ,
this &apos;ll only take a minute .
i already told the prosecution everything i know .
they &apos;re supposed to share it with you , right ?
yeah . but i &apos;m wondering about some things
that they may not have asked you about .
do you want a gummy bear ?
i do .
thanks .
so did ms.riggs exhibit
any other sketchy behavior on the flight ?
like , did she drink too much or maybe steal magazines ?
no . why ?
well , you &apos;ve seen my client , right ?
why would a woman like her be interested in a guy like him ,
a dorky calculus professor ?
unless she was using him .
well there was that thing in the bathroom .
yeah , that thing in the bathroom .
sorry , wait , what was that thing in the bathroom ?
the ... mile high club thing .
robyn . hello .
hello .
may i help you ?
yeah , i just need to ask you some questions .
we just don &apos;t understand
why we get the small jury room
and the other jury gets the big one .
it &apos;s not the big one .
ours is just as small .
i &apos;ll remind you , sir , that you are in the jury box .
you asked us to share that , remember ?
we will rotate the jury rooms as well as the seats .
it was a full flight
and we had no more overhead space .
so i told mr. lampe his carry @-@ on
would have to be stowed a few rows away .
and how did he respond to that ?
he was agitated ,
argued with me about it .
in fact ...
there came a point when the bag became the subject of dispute
between mr. lampe and another passenger ,
didn &apos;t it ?
yes , the passenger in 26b
tried to move it to access his own bag ,
and mr. lampe shouted at him .
and exactly what did mr. lampe shout ?
objection , hearsay .
your honor , we object to that objection .
the jury has a right to hear this exculpatory evidence .
which jury ?
our jury . ms. riggs &apos; jury .
not in our jury &apos;s presence , your honor .
it is hearsay . but not when used defensively .
harris , please escort that jury ,
the jury listening to mr. lampe &apos;s defense ,
out to the jury room .
but leave the other jury behind .
let &apos;s go . this way .
what did you hear mr. lampe shout
at the passenger who tried to move his carry @-@ on ?
he said , &quot; let go of my bag . &quot;
and did ms. riggs intervene in this argument ?
objection , your honor ,
our jury should be allowed to hear this .
you said it was hearsay .
no , the statement was hearsay ,
not the ensuing encounter .
your honor , we object to the other defense editing
the testimony as they so wish .
what does it matter to you ?
you act like this is a zero @-@ sum game .
thank you .
the jury will be allowed back in .
harris ?
way ahead of you , your honor .
&quot; we &apos;re taking the gloves off . &quot; that &apos;s what you told me .
but i never authorized you to ...
i didn &apos;t know you were gonna do this .
eli , i could fill a book
with what you know about what you don &apos;t know .
so where are you taking this ?
i &apos;m taking this ...
where you want me to take this .
if you &apos;re taping this , jim ,
i &apos;m not offering third @-@ party consent ,
so any recording will be considered inadmissible .
you think that of me ?
i think this conversation is oddly stilted .
okay , let me make it less stilted .
i could get three years for election fraud .
why do i do that ?
because you &apos;re a good soldier .
i could get less if i testified .
and you &apos;d have no friends , then .
ever .
right now you have the friendship of the governor .
lot of good that does me .
better than no one .
okay .
so it stops at you , right ?
and i wasn &apos;t here .
ms. barrett , you commented about noticing
ms. riggs and mr. lampe .
did you see ms. riggs in the vicinity
of the business class restrooms ?
yes .
is this the woman you saw
enter the lavatory with ms. riggs ?
objection , your honor . relevance ?
the relevance is that
ms. riggs was faking her love for our client
in order to get him to deliver drugs .
that is our contention , your honor .
overruled , i will allow .
ms. barrett , how long were ms. riggs and this woman
in the lavatory together ?
about 15 minutes .
and when they emerged from the bathroom ,
did you notice anything unusual about ms. riggs ?
it &apos;s okay .
she was adjusting her skirt .
thank you .
it &apos;s not true , howie .
excuse me , madam , no talking here .
ms. pine ?
judge , may we approach ?
the prosecution would like to recall ms. riggs &apos; jury
so they can hear this testimony on redirect .
we object to that , your honor .
on what basis ?
its prejudicial impact
outweighs its probative value .
that &apos;s why my client &apos;s jury was sequestered in the first place .
no , your jury was sequestered
because ms. riggs counsel elicited the testimony .
it &apos;s a different matter if the prosecution elicited it .
he &apos;s right , ms. lockhart .
ms. riggs &apos; defense is that
she was manipulated by mr. lampe .
the prosecution wants to undercut that
by presenting testimony alleging
an on @-@ flight liaison with a stranger .
that &apos;s exactly right , your honor .
harris .
got it .
you guys , let &apos;s go .
yes , they were alone in the bathroom for 15 minutes .
and based on your experience
as a flight attendant , when two people enter a lavatory ,
what is usually the purpose of that visit ?
objection , calls for speculation .
overruled .
sex . of course .
ms. barrett ,
do you believe in pre @-@ marital sex ?
objection , relevance .
no .
how is the witness &apos;s belief remotely relevant here ?
is is connected to her perception of what happened .
overruled .
ms. barrett , you disapprove of my client &apos;s lifestyle ,
don &apos;t you ?
no .
no ? well , my client is attractive ,
she &apos;s unmarried , she &apos;s traveling with a single man .
you &apos;re jealous .
objection , argumentative .
that one i &apos;ll sustain .
did my client ask you for a clip
to keep her skirt from slipping ?
what ?
did my client ask you for something
to keep her skirt from slipping
due to a broken clasp ?
she did , but ... that &apos;s not ...
are you saying that that &apos;s why this woman
was helping her in the lavatory ?
yes .
objection , your honor , misstates the eviden ...
don &apos;t object .
one second , your honor .
we need to get the other jury back in here to hear this .
why do we need the other jury ?
we want to convict them both .
she can &apos;t be seen as screwing around on him .
are you counselors still objecting ?
actually , no , your honor . we withdraw our objections
and ask that we be allowed to redirect this witness
in front of the other jury .
are you friggin &apos; kidding me ?
harris .
why is that , counselor ?
we need to ...
i don &apos;t know , i ...
because ?
it was just about my skirt .
i know .
i trust you . here they come .
they &apos;re offering six years .
for each of you ,
but it &apos;s a package deal . you both plead
to simple possession or neither of you do .
oh , it &apos;s an elementary game theory , you know ?
we &apos;re better off if we act together ,
but not as well off as we might be if we act alone .
it &apos;s the prosecution &apos;s idea .
they want to play you against each other .
they weren &apos;t offering a plea before trial ,
now they are .
it means they know we &apos;ve made a dent in their case .
and wh @-@ what are our chances of beating this ?
um ... why don &apos;t we talk over here ?
no , no , no . no . we &apos;re , uh ...
we &apos;re in this together .
okay .
you cut a pretty sympathetic figure , howard .
because my jury thinks darla manipulated me ?
yes .
what about my jury ?
it &apos;s better if they think you &apos;re howard &apos;s pawn .
so our best chance here
is if no one believes we &apos;re in love .
yes .
it &apos;s only for the purpose of the trial .
it &apos;s just for how you appear in court .
it &apos;s not really why ...
that &apos;s one of my jurors .
talking to one of mine .
can i buy you a drink ?
i have a drink .
i &apos;ll buy you another .
i &apos;ll take two .
you following me ?
no , i &apos;m having a drink .
kalinda , i told you i &apos;d give you five minutes .
don &apos;t waste &apos; em .
okay .
i miss you .
you pretend you &apos;re jumping ship with florrick @-@ agos
so you can pass our secrets to lockhart / gardner .
they &apos;re my employer , cary .
and i was your friend .
yeah , which is why i kept your secret for three months .
oh , what ... what secret ?
that you were leaving .
you know , will was ready to fire me for that .
i &apos;m not your enemy , cary ,
but i can &apos;t endanger my job for you .
great , you &apos;ve said your piece ...
oh , i &apos;m s ... i &apos;m , oh , my god . i am so sorry .
here , wait , let me do this .
uh ... i get it . i got it , i got it , i got it .
紧急通知 事关佩斯莉集团
我们有机会说服他们投奔我们
when we got into our room this morning ,
someone left stinky thai food in the garbage .
the other jury was the last one in there .
any other matters counsel would like to address before we begin ?
no , your honor .
no , your honor .
mrs. florrick ?
nothing , your honor .
then let us proceed , shall we ?
abel botera ...
i &apos;m a doorman at the cinque terre resort in rio de janeiro .
mr. botera , this is security video from the resort lobby
from the afternoon of july 11th of this year .
can you identify this man ?
yes , that &apos;s alonso cazorla .
and are you aware that mr. cazorla has been convicted by brazilian
courts of trafficking in narcotics on three separate occasions ?
yes , everyone in rio knows this .
can you identify the two people meeting with him here ?
yes . the defendants .
you &apos;ve described mr. cazorla as a drug dealer .
but he also runs a scuba diving company , doesn &apos;t he ?
and a nightclub , two gas stations .
all fronts for ...
so what we &apos;re watching here
could simply be an exchange of money for scuba gear .
isn &apos;t that right ?
i guess .
in fact , didn &apos;t ms. riggs ask you to arrange
a scuba lesson with mr. cazorla
a day before this video was taken ?
yes .
and that scuba lesson was for ms. riggs alone .
wasn &apos;t it ?
yes . yes .
so to your knowledge , only ms. riggs met with mr. cazorla
prior to the meeting that was captured on this video ?
objection , your honor , sidebar .
right ?
by eliciting testimony that my client alone
met with a convicted drug dealer ,
mr. agos is implying that ms. riggs
was solely responsible .
we have an absolute right to exculpate our client .
not by implicating ours , you don &apos;t .
judge , we request limiting instructions .
it &apos;s like herding cats with you people .
step back .
it &apos;d be better if we work together .
tell that to will .
what is it ?
kalinda thinks the paisley group might be ready to bolt .
we &apos;ve been ignoring them .
yeah , she has information on a case they &apos;re worried about .
can you handle this ?
yes , go .
i am instructing ms. riggs &apos; jury
to disregard mr. agos &apos; entire cross .
mr. lampe &apos;s jury , the ones in the folding chairs ...
no , we &apos;re up here now .
okay , good .
i &apos;m happy .
has someone told you i &apos;m not happy ?
we just want to do our due diligence , sir .
the paisley group matters to us . you matter to us .
well , at first , i considered florrick @-@ agos .
but again , i &apos;m happy .
i don &apos;t know how else to say it .
i understand , sir , but we &apos;ve identified
some areas where you may need help .
haley elliott ?
what about her ?
not to sound indelicate .
i know about the solicitation charge , sir .
you @-@ you know ... ?
i don &apos;t ...
what do you know ?
that any decent firm can get you off ,
but the matter &apos;s still public record .
now , lockhart / gardner
can get the arrest expunged .
which as a ceo of a major corporation ...
haley is not a prostitute . she &apos;s my granddaughter .
she &apos;s ... ?
is this some sort of joke ?
she &apos;s in a wheelchair with hodgkin &apos;s .
no , sir , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m very sorry .
i was terribly misinformed .
yes , you were .
is there anything else you need from me ?
no , sir .
we &apos;re ... fine .
i &apos;ll call this afternoon .
what was that about ?
cary .
what about him ?
yes , mr. paisley , absolutely ,
we would love to meet .
right , exactly , one of the reasons
we left lockhart / gardner was because
it was getting too big , and losing sight of its clients .
the paisley group .
you &apos;re kidding ? how ?
i thought they weren &apos;t coming .
i paid a bartender to spill a drink on me .
you ... ? no , i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here .
we &apos;re following all the ethical rules , marilyn .
yes , unfortunately , this isn &apos;t about the ethical rules .
i @-@ i just need to ask you a few questions , alicia .
after court .
this isn &apos;t about you as peter &apos;s spouse .
it &apos;s about you as peter &apos;s lawyer .
court is now in session .
the honorable loudon spencer presiding .
mr. botera ?
what languages does mr. cazorla speak ?
far as i know just portuguese .
so only a person conversant in portuguese could have
a meaningful conversation with him ?
i guess .
and to your knowledge ,
did either mr. lampe or ms. riggs speak portuguese ?
only mr. lampe did .
which is why he was the only one
who was speaking to mr. cazorla in the video .
right ?
judge , sidebar ?
this is precisely the type of questioning
that mr. gardner objected to .
apples and oranges , your honor .
he &apos;s implicating our client in front of our jury .
after you implicated ours in front of hers .
look , if this is about the paisley group ,
why don &apos;t you just come out and say it ?
what are you talking about ?
we request limiting instructions .
no .
your honor , without limiting instructions ,
our client &apos;s case is fatally compromised .
sit down , counselor .
you understand that &apos;s reversible error , right ?
excuse me ?
i think mrs. florrick is simply requesting
an explanation for the record .
here &apos;s my explanation .
i &apos;m tired of the games and the backbiting .
we &apos;re gonna finish this trial .
you understand ? no more sequestration .
no more limiting instructions .
if you want to appeal at the end of it ,
knock yourself out .
i would like to request conference in chambers .
you &apos;re on thin ice here , mrs. florrick ,
i understand .
but there &apos;s a matter i &apos;ve been remiss
in bringing to the court &apos;s immediate attention .
juror misconduct ?
yes ! your honor , we saw two jurors
from opposing juries ...
they &apos;re not opposing .
... conferring with each other
after court yesterday .
and what &apos;s your explanation
for sitting on this ?
context , your honor .
initially i thought it was an innocent exchange .
and did you witness
this illicit communication , too , mr. gardner ?
no , judge .
your honor , that &apos;s ...
mr. gardner was with me .
if mrs. florrick is accusing me of lying to the court ,
i assume she can corroborate that accusation .
um , no , your honor .
per ... perhaps i was mistaken
as to what mr. gardner observed .
so you know nothing about this video ?
alicia , have you seen this video before ?
no .
do you know anything about the activity depicted in this video ?
no .
but these were the ballots you went to court to dispute , correct ?
i have no idea .
and just to be specific ,
i went to court to delegitimize those votes .
right . thanks for clarifying that .
do you know jim moody ?
no . i mean , i know of him .
he worked on my husband &apos;s campaign .
you never had a conversation with jim moody ?
marilyn , i have answered all your questions
as candidly as i can .
i have no idea about this video , period .
now , i &apos;m in the middle of a trial .
of course . thank you for your time .
can you leave us , please ?
i &apos;ll call you back .
i was here to see marilyn garbanza .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
i didn &apos;t , i didn &apos;t think she &apos;d be moving so fast .
that video ?
did you know anything about it ?
i wasn &apos;t even aware of its existence until yesterday .
i &apos;m not talking about its existence .
i &apos;m talking about what it depicts .
alicia , if i had known what jim moody was up to ,
why would i have asked you to disqualify those ballots ?
you didn &apos;t ask me .
eli did .
because he didn &apos;t know anything about what moody was up to .
and neither did i.
zach , our son ,
testified in court
about those ballots .
i know .
and he will have to testify again .
this time in front of the feds .
i hope not .
no !
my son will not get caught up in the middle of this hurricane .
you need to fix this .
alicia ...
just tell me that you will fix it , okay ?
just tell me that .
i &apos;m gonna fix it .
well played , cary .
when did you find out
haley elliott was his granddaughter ?
after we accused him of solicitation .
you paid the bartender to spill the drinks ,
and then texted your own phone ?
yup .
when did you think to do that ?
ah , not too much before you got there .
take care , kalinda .
so , we &apos;re even now ?
yeah . why ?
then let &apos;s get a drink .
so you can get one up on me ?
no .
&apos;cause i want a drink .
this isn &apos;t a good idea , kalinda .
i know .
so ?
ryan belfair .
i &apos;m the head of security for the cinque terre resort .
mr. belfair , what are we watching here ?
it &apos;s security video from the sixth floor of the cinque terre resort .
could you please tell us what you see next ?
that &apos;s mr. lampe and ms. riggs
with alonso cazorla .
mr. lampe &apos;s handing him an envelope .
was mr. cazorla staying at the hotel ?
he was not .
so as head of resort security , could you please explain
how mr. cazorla got up to mr. lampe &apos;s room
on the sixth floor ?
someone staying at that hotel would had
to have given him a key to access the elevator .
thank you . nothing further .
mr. gardner ?
mr. belfair ,
you have no idea what was in that envelope , do you ?
no , but i can guess .
i &apos;m not asking you to guess .
i &apos;m asking if you know .
no .
alicia ...
i noticed something in the video .
when i talked to the flight attendant ,
she was packing all during the conversation .
now , the video that we just saw in court ?
alonso cazorla is wearing a t @-@ shirt
that says &quot; honey bar &quot; on it .
it &apos;s a place that he owns .
and i remember ms. barrett
had a cap that said &quot; honey bar . &quot;
so i went to her profile .
and i found this picture .
we could argue that the flight attendant and the coke king
knew each other .
that &apos;s great work , robyn .
now , here &apos;s a question .
should we tell them ?
will and diane ?
it helps us both if we &apos;re arguing in sync .
yeah .
or could they try to screw us ?
yeah , if they want us to lose more than they want to win .
ms. barrett , were you in a drug treatment facility
in 2006 for addiction to painkillers ?
objection . relevance .
she testified , your honor .
the jury has a right
to judge her trustworthiness .
overruled . please answer .
yes .
i was in rehab for four months .
and you &apos;ve struggled with narcotics addiction ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m cured now .
now , you &apos;ve run up a credit card debt
that &apos;s currently $ 45,000 ...
objection , your honor .
this is naked character assassination .
sustained .
nothing further , your honor .
ms. barrett , as a flight attendant ,
do you have to go through airport security ?
yes , i &apos;m subject to expedited screening .
in fact , at galeao airport
you bypass security altogether .
your bag isn &apos;t x @-@ rayed . it &apos;s not searched .
yes . but that &apos;s true for every crew member .
so to summarize ...
you have a history of drug use ,
a huge debt load ,
the ability to bypass airport security ...
objection .
counsel is testifying . ... access to the bag in question
during the entire flight ...
sustained .
is it true that you planted drugs
in my client &apos;s carry @-@ on
in order to extract it ...
objection !
your honor ! ...
once they had cleared security ?
the jury will disregard
mrs. florrick &apos;s entire cross @-@ examination ,
completely lacking in foundation .
you will pay it no mind .
oh , thank you .
the waiting ...
i keep thinking the worst .
i have a good feeling about this .
me , too .
jury &apos;s back .
which one ?
theirs .
and has the jury reached a verdict ?
we have , your honor .
in the matter of howard lampe , what say you ?
actually , we &apos;re the darla riggs jury .
what say you ?
on the charge of felony possession
of a controlled substance with intent to deliver ,
we find the defendant not guilty .
and it appears we have another matter to attend to .
mr. lampe &apos;s jury
has requested that excerpts of testimony
from two witnesses be read back .
what does that mean ?
it means they need more information before they decide .
that &apos;s bad .
isn &apos;t it ?
if they need more information , that &apos;s bad ?
mr. gardner , you were the florrick campaign &apos;s attorney
at the time of his election , correct ?
no , i was one of a number of florrick campaign attorneys .
i see .
and in your capacity as one of his attorneys ,
did you attempt to invalidate a ballot box
that you believed had been compromised ?
i did .
and at some point ,
did you become aware of a video
that suggested a campaign florrick operative
tampered with that ballot box ?
do you need me to repeat the question ?
marilyn , what &apos;s going on here ?
i &apos;m conducting an investigation .
an ethics investigation , not a grand jury proceeding .
i was under the impression that eli asked you to cooperate with me .
yes , i became aware of a video .
thank you .
and did you bring your awareness of that video
to the governor &apos;s attention ?
no .
no , you didn &apos;t ?
no , i can &apos;t answer .
any advice i gave governor florrick on this matter
is shielded by attorney @-@ client privilege .
i see .
come with me , please .
it &apos;s open .
marilyn . what do you need ?
sir , i need you to waive
attorney @-@ client privilege
so mr. gardner can answer my questions .
and ... what is the scope
of the waiver you &apos;re seeking ?
one that covers all matters related to my inquiry .
give us a moment . alone .
certainly .
why ?
because i want to speak to mr. gardner .
anything you discuss
should be part of my investigation .
i want to talk to him as a lawyer :
a lawyer that used to represent me .
do you understand that ?
i do .
i &apos;ll be right out here .
if i were to waive privilege ,
what would your testimony be ?
that i visited you
in your hotel suite on election day .
that i had acquired a videotape
that i wanted you to see .
a videotape that i refused to see ?
that &apos;s correct .
okay .
and , uh , that would be it ?
no .
i told you that the video proved
30,000 of your votes were fraudulent .
no .
you told me you had video evidence
that i would lose the election .
yes , that , too .
then i said ,
&quot; the 30,000 votes are fraudulent . &quot;
that &apos;s not how i remember it .
really ?
and how do you remember
taking back diane &apos;s judgeship ?
so we &apos;re headed ... we &apos;re headed that way , huh ?
no , i &apos;m just making a point .
politicians have a way of misremembering things to their liking .
yeah , tell me about
the ethics of that , counselor .
what could i tell the most ethical administration
in illinois history ?
do you even hear yourself ?
suspended lawyer ,
man who cheats with other men &apos;s wives ...
what do you want me to do , peter ?
as your lawyer ,
what do you want me to do ?
marilyn .
yes , mr. governor ?
i have instructed mr. gardner
not to waive my attorney @-@ client privilege .
are you sure , sir ?
yes .
the s.a. is panicking .
they &apos;re afraid of walking away with nothing ,
so they &apos;ve sweetened the offer .
four years .
you &apos;ll be eligible for parole in two .
but do you think i can win ?
i don &apos;t know .
my life is probabilities .
the odds of ...
me meeting darla :
it &apos;s two million to one .
and the odds of our falling in love :
60 million to one .
what are the odds of an acquittal ?
it &apos;s a coin toss .
but the downside ...
if you were me ,
what would you do , alicia ?
two years .
that &apos;s a lifetime .
i &apos;ll wait for you , howard .
yeah ?
as long as it takes .
yeah ?
yeah .
&quot; accordingly , i am unable to take a position
&quot; regarding the propriety of
the florrick administration &apos;s conduct in this matter ... &quot;
oh , come on !
your conclusion is that you can &apos;t draw a conclusion ?
yes .
because i didn &apos;t finish my investigation .
we made everyone available ...
the most important witness
refused to answer my questions
because the governor won &apos;t waive
attorney @-@ client privilege .
what witness ?
will gardner .
the witness who discovered the video
and tried to show the governor .
there are other reasons why peter won &apos;t waive .
this guy has got it out for him .
he fired his wife ... - eli .
my report is inconclusive
until i have the governor &apos;s full
and unconditional cooperation .
you &apos;re throwing this into the laps of the feds ?
no . but it might end up in the laps of the feds
because you don &apos;t trust me .
he did nothing wrong .
we won by eight points .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
peter is in real trouble , eli .
he &apos;s in trouble for one reason .
will gardner .
damn it !
