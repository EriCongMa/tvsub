we &apos;re building a rat trap .
and you &apos;re the cheese .
&quot; leave my friends alone . i killed charlotte . &quot;
i didn &apos;t wanna think that &apos;s what happened .
there &apos;s gonna be a lock on that box tomorrow .
but it &apos;s not what it looks like . i promise you .
save your lies for someone who has time to hear them .
i told spencer it was okay if she and caleb got together .
how did this get so complicated ?
you &apos;re writing a book with the guy
you used to be in love with .
it &apos;s about his dead girlfriend .
i never stopped loving you .
if i &apos;d just come back a few minutes earlier .
you &apos;re not real .
it wasn &apos;t my fault .
mary drake is a patient here .
she had a child named charles .
your mom and wilden are dead .
they came back for me .
you &apos;re the only man my daughter ever loved .
i would have done anything for charlotte .
hanna !
han !
&quot; thanks for giving me hanna . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re free to go . &quot; &quot; a.d. &quot;
how could we let this happen ?
oh , my god , poor hanna .
try to remember that it &apos;s what she &apos;d want .
no , i don &apos;t know if i can live with this .
i mean , how can we bury ..
there has to be another way .
there is no other way , emily .
it was a well thought @-@ out plan and when it ends up like this
it &apos;s called first @-@ degree murder .
look , spencer is right .
come on .
第七季第一集
toby , you speak cops . you should do the talking .
wait , toby , your job is on the line here .
you sure that you wanna be a part of this ?
are you serious , spencer ? hanna &apos;s life is on the line .
when you asked me for my help , i said i was all in . i still am .
alright , we &apos;re wasting time . let &apos;s go .
guys , hold up .
alison &apos;s not the only one seeing ghosts tonight .
maybe she wasn &apos;t seeing ghosts at all .
unless we &apos;re under a body @-@ snatcher invasion
that &apos;s a real person .
when they dug up mrs. d in my backyard
she wasn &apos;t just a little bit dead
she was rotting @-@ corpse dead .
whoever the hell that is , she was at the lost woods tonight .
if she &apos;s a part of this , she knows where hanna is
and i will beat the truth out of her if i have to .
no , no , no , you can &apos;t just walk in there
and start throwing punches .
just , just give me a minute . let me find out why she &apos;s here .
and who she is or what she is .
hi . officer cavanaugh .
how can i help you ?
i &apos;m the new owner of the lost woods resort
and i need to report a break @-@ in .
hmm . i have to ask .
you &apos;re a dead ringer for a woman who used to live here .
jessica was my sister .
she &apos;s jessica &apos;s twin , mary drake .
from the radley file .
she &apos;s charlotte &apos;s biological mom .
so why &apos;re we still standing here ?
she thinks hanna killed her daughter .
she &apos;s a.d.
maybe .
but she &apos;s one step ahead of us .
she just bought the lost woods
and she &apos;s in there filing a report about a break @-@ in .
by us .
damn it .
&quot; a lie for a lie , an eye for an eye . &quot;
&quot; the bell tolls for hanna . &quot;
&quot; a.d. &quot;
no ! no !
oh , my god .
hanna .
no !
no , hanna !
oh , my god .
hanna .
toby .
come on .
come on .
be careful .
oh , my god .
hanna .
hanna .
hanna .
be careful .
be careful .
hanna .
this isn &apos;t happening .
she &apos;s dead .
hanna .
oh , my god . hanna .
it &apos;s a mask .
what ?
it isn &apos;t hanna .
what do you mean ?
oh , my god .
what ?
so where the hell &apos;s hanna ?
what &apos;s this ?
you &apos;ve got 24 hours to give me charlotte &apos;s real killer
or hanna dies .
tick @-@ tock , bitches .
what do we do ?
oh , my god .
okay , so my parents are about to board
their post @-@ election victory cruise
so we can make this place command central .
look , we &apos;ve been trying to figure out
who killed charlotte since she died .
do we really think that we &apos;re gonna solve
that mystery in under 24 hours ?
yes . we will because we have to .
this is the first time we &apos;ve all been working together .
that &apos;s what makes it different .
that and a creepy twin .
mary has to be a.d.
what bigger motive is there ?
and she has to be working with someone .
while she was running around the woods last night
somebody else dragged hanna out of that motel room .
guys , mona &apos;s right .
it &apos;s just like ali told hanna .
all of us working together knew what happened to her .
so all of us together can figure out
who killed charlotte .
i &apos;m sure each one of us has some idea about who did it .
don &apos;t we ?
is there somebody out there ?
no . please !
please open the door .
you can &apos;t leave me in here . i &apos;m begging you .
please !
&quot; alison . &quot;
&quot; alison . &quot;
&quot; alison . &quot;
&quot; no name . &quot;
&quot; mona . &quot;
&quot; spencer . &quot;
&quot; alison . &quot;
so most of us think that alison killed her sister .
okay , now we need to prove she had the motive
and the opportunity to murder charlotte .
i don &apos;t know about a motive , but she had the opportunity .
oh , i should go . it &apos;s late .
yeah .
is that alison ? looks like her car .
i think that &apos;s charlotte .
that night we thought that it was charlotte
but maybe it was alison .
how do you know it wasn &apos;t charlotte ?
charlotte wasn &apos;t wearing a red jacket that night
and she didn &apos;t drive alison &apos;s car home .
ali loved charlotte .
i mean , she stayed here to take care of her .
why would she do that just to kill her
as soon as she got out ?
and th @-@ there &apos;s no motive .
she &apos;s been on her best behavior
since she got back , but we can &apos;t pretend
the alison who blinded jenna never existed .
maybe your goody two @-@ shoes ex became too much
for her to handle .
maybe she snapped .
or maybe it was self @-@ defense .
maybe it was charlotte who snapped again .
we all know that she was upset
about alison and elliot being together .
maybe ali had to defend herself .
i don &apos;t care why she did it , okay ?
i just , i wanna find a way to prove
that she did it so that we can get hanna back .
okay , well , if the person who murdered charlotte
was wearing the red jacket ,
it &apos;ll have charlotte &apos;s blood on it .
we &apos;ll go to her house to look for it .
i &apos;m all over mary drake .
i think she &apos;s the fastest route to hanna .
i agree .
so we work together .
she said she was moving into the motel .
all roads lead to the lost woods resort .
oh , my god , hanna .
mona , let me see .
oh , she looks so scared .
at least she &apos;s alive .
you guys , we have to get to her .
but where is she ?
we need to find her now .
here are the keys to ali &apos;s house .
i &apos;m going to welby . and i &apos;m not leaving without an answer .
ali has to tell me the truth .
what the hell is in those bags ?
come on , let &apos;s go .
hey , there &apos;s no reason for all four of us to tail her .
look , caleb &apos;s right . let &apos;s head back over to the motel
and find out everything we can about mary drake .
yeah , sure .
can i borrow your keys ?
yeah .
here .
yeah , but you &apos;ll need another thing to push down--
tumbler ? got it .
oh , you &apos;ve gotten a lot better at this .
yeah , i took a tactical lock opening course at the academy .
that &apos;s impressive .
it &apos;s strange that alison didn &apos;t know
her mother had a twin .
elliot , almost everything
about the dilaurentis family is strange .
how do you know that mary is charlotte &apos;s mom ?
cece drake , mary drake .
i just put two and two together .
oh , this is important news .
and i &apos;m glad you confided in me .
but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not enough to help alison .
ali thought she was seeing dead people .
this is clear proof that she wasn &apos;t .
emily , since the last time you saw her
my wife &apos;s condition has ..
... rapidly declined .
i &apos;m afraid she suffered a complete psychotic break .
i don &apos;t understand .
neither do i.
but she is consumed with shame
i believe , prompted by a tragic event
that @-@ that she feels responsible for .
do you have any idea what she could &apos;ve done
that would prompt her to have such a , a lethal dose of guilt ?
no !
doctor , it &apos;s a code white .
no ! no ! no !
no ! no !
get away from me !
no ! no !
no !
books .
and more books .
these are all written in german .
i think most of these are french textbooks .
medicine , banking , construction .
fortgeschrittene konzepte in der chemie .
advanced concepts in chemistry .
you speak german ?
i &apos;m sort of obsessed with this language app
where they reward you with a flag
every time you reach the fluent level .
then your little emoji boards a plane
and it flies to the country .
sort of obsessed ? how many flags do you have ?
um , french , italian , german
and this close to flying to china .
the art of cyber war .
appliquer principe et prouve .
applied and proven principles .
if mary drake is a.d. ,
she &apos;s a self @-@ taught &quot; uber a. &quot;
and she &apos;s been to more countries than your emoji .
mostly europe . but she &apos;s been to latin america too .
oh , hey , look at this .
she flew from heathrow to philly a month ago .
that was right before charlotte died .
about a week .
so she &apos;s had plenty of time to become a.d.
okay .
we &apos;re good .
okay .
linen closet .
i &apos;ll check the dresser .
that &apos;s , that &apos;s a little weird .
oh , please don &apos;t tell me that you found a toy .
it &apos;s already bad enough that i &apos;m going
through alison &apos;s panty drawer . i don &apos;t need to--
it &apos;s locked .
it &apos;s not here .
i can &apos;t find a key anywhere .
did you hear that ?
and in a related story ,
the prime minister told bns in an exclusive interview
that we need a proper government inquiry into all of this .
in fact , the last government ended scandals like this
the current government is in ...
uh , i just realized none of us
have had anything to eat since yesterday .
can i bring you guys something ?
food &apos;s the last thing on my mind , spencer .
okay , um , well ,
then i &apos;m gonna go over the mary drake file again .
maybe there &apos;s something--
alright , great .
bye to you too .
i &apos;ve got everything that we need .
who &apos;s she talkin &apos; to ?
i can only hear her side of the call .
i need just a few more seconds to ..
no . no , no , no , no , no . no , no .
don &apos;t hang up . don &apos;t ..
bleach , charcoal ... vinegar .
that &apos;s everything you need to cover up a murder .
what &apos;s the charcoal for ?
absorbs the smell of death .
hey , she &apos;s still alive .
how can you be so sure ?
because they aren &apos;t gonna use that tarp after the fact .
and she &apos;s gonna lead us to hanna .
yeah , because she &apos;s on her way to kill her .
please stop . stop !
please .
please stop .
no . no . no . please stop . please !
stop !
stop !
she &apos;s been driving around for hours .
she &apos;s either taking a tour of the county
or she &apos;s completely lost .
or she knows that we &apos;re following her
and she &apos;s just jerking us around .
she &apos;s turning left .
she &apos;s not leading us to hanna .
she @-@ she &apos;s taking us to alison &apos;s house .
cut the lights .
wait , she &apos;s going to spencer &apos;s .
是玛丽 · 德雷克
are you spencer or melissa ?
um , i know you must be jessica &apos;s sister .
but have we met ?
a long time ago , but you wouldn &apos;t remember .
i &apos;m spencer .
are your parents home ?
no , they &apos;re on a cruise .
i &apos;ll check back another time .
so you know each other ?
we used to have a lot in common .
would you like to come inside ?
i can make us some tea .
yes . yes , i would .
herbal or leaded .
oh , i &apos;ve never been one to turn down caffeine .
elliot &apos;s not here .
but the nurse says she &apos;s calmed down
and i can see her for a few minutes .
well , i hope she tells you the truth
because we &apos;re running out of time .
i &apos;m allowed to go in now . i &apos;ll call you back .
ali ?
are you awake ?
ali , please wake up .
hanna &apos;s in trouble .
okay ? and i need to know the truth .
the truth about charlotte .
did you do it ?
did you ..
did you kill her ?
oh , god , help me .
oh , please , god , forgive me .
you and your sister look so much alike .
almost like twins .
yeah , people thought that a lot when we were younger .
are you close ?
occasionally .
so when did you see my parents last ?
i only asked because they never talked about you .
i know enough about your family
to know that they &apos;re excellent secret keepers .
well , why would they keep you a secret ?
you certainly are inquisitive .
i was just making conversation .
i &apos;m sorry . forgive me if i &apos;m overly sensitive .
the truth is , my sister and i didn &apos;t get along .
i moved away because she ..
... turned everyone against me .
my friends , my family .
she poisoned them all against me .
why ?
i was born first , and she was born jealous .
well , may i ask why you &apos;ve come back ?
i mean , why now ?
because i found out she was dead .
well , i &apos;ve taken up enough of your time .
thank you for the tea .
yeah .
um , so you &apos;re at the lost woods all by yourself ?
yes , i &apos;m all alone .
do you have any children ?
like i said , it &apos;s just me .
how would you know that that &apos;s where i &apos;m staying ?
oh , it &apos;s such a small town .
my ex @-@ boyfriend is a cop
and he told me about your break @-@ in .
you know , you &apos;re a very lucky young woman .
i can &apos;t seem to be friends with any of my ex @-@ lovers .
c &apos;est la vie .
c &apos;est la vie .
you should lock this door .
these days , you &apos;re not safe anywhere .
she looks so scared .
it &apos;s been over 36 hours since you got any sleep .
maybe you should try and rest .
yeah .
okay .
i &apos;ll get a t @-@ shirt , and i &apos;ll set the alarm .
maybe i should go home .
are you sure ?
no , i mean ,
i &apos;m not really sure of anything .
you know , i haven &apos;t talked to liam in days .
you and i , we haven &apos;t even talked
about what happened between us .
was it a slip
or are we friends with benefits ?
are we even a we again ?
i guess we have a lot to talk about .
yeah , i just , i , um , feel like
i need to think about it before i can talk about it .
okay .
em , hey .
how did it go with ali ?
uh , turns out they wouldn &apos;t let me in to see her .
do you still have that key that i gave you ?
ali &apos;s ?
uh , yeah .
are you thinking about going back there ?
i &apos;ll come with you . emily .
um , i &apos;ll give you a call if i go .
yeah , okay .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
again with the lies .
i &apos;m sorry .
that was a joke .
it &apos;s just ..
... someone that i care very deeply for .
and i &apos;m starting to think that she did a very bad thing .
now another friend is paying the price for it .
i made some lemon bars this morning .
it &apos;ll go really good with that cappuccino .
come on .
what is she doing ?
it &apos;s called pacing .
you know , i can actually appreciate your skillset
but do you always have to be such a smart @-@ ass ?
do you always have to be so direct ?
i was giving you a compliment .
calling me names isn &apos;t complimentary .
whatever .
you know , she &apos;s in there alone . we can take her .
and then what ? we waterboard her ?
look , a.d. said we have 24 hours .
we still have six of those left .
wait , her phone &apos;s ringing .
oh , come on , mary , keep talking .
can you hear the other person ?
don &apos;t shush me .
the signal keeps dropping in and out
but it &apos;s definitely a man .
i think he has an accent . maybe aussie , maybe british .
what is that ?
i got a lock on the caller &apos;s signal .
it &apos;s coming from a bar near hollis called snookers .
i &apos;m on it .
aria , mary drake is talking to a british guy
or possibly an aussie at a bar near hollis .
it &apos;s called snookers . do you know it ?
yeah , i used to go there with ezra .
i was on my way home . i can be there in five minutes .
be careful .
hanna .
oh , spencer .
you &apos;ve got this , hanna .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
i think i &apos;m gonna die in here .
no , i won &apos;t let that happen .
but this is a dream .
you can &apos;t help me . you &apos;re not real , spence .
something real is actually existing
as a thing or occurring in fact .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying , but i &apos;m glad that you &apos;re here .
a dream is an experience
and an experience is real .
do you understand ?
maybe .
no .
i should &apos;ve listened to you .
spence , i think ...
... this a is a lot smarter than the others .
you told them the truth , right ?
maybe it &apos;s a good thing we don &apos;t know who killed charlotte .
&apos;cause i &apos;d tell if i did .
i &apos;m scared , spence .
i know . i know .
there &apos;s no way out .
no , look , if a.d. can come in and out of here
you can , too .
think about it , hanna .
if there is a way in , there is a way out , right ?
yeah , i guess so .
say it .
if there is a way in , there is a way out .
you &apos;re gonna need your strength for tomorrow .
get some sleep .
will you stay with me ?
always .
* hush little baby don &apos;t say a word *
* papa &apos;s gonna buy you a mockingbird *
* and if that mockingbird won &apos;t sing *
what can i get you ?
oh , i &apos;m looking for a guy .
um , no . he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s just not any guy .
he &apos;s british , maybe .
can i get you something to drink or not ?
sure . yeah . i &apos;ll take a beer . thanks .
thanks .
hey , don &apos;t look away . i &apos;m right here .
yeah . yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
hey , you &apos;re doin &apos; alright ?
doin &apos; fine . how are you ?
good , man . hey , where have you been ?
workin &apos; my tail off like always .
yeah , i hear you , man .
i don &apos;t need to know what we are tonight .
i just need to be with you .
we &apos;ll be friends forever .
that &apos;s why i love you . you &apos;re big on happy endings .
i never told you this , but you were always my favorite .
you &apos;d look so good on top of the eiffel tower
wind in your hair .
you were the hardest for me to leave behind .
ali , are you asleep ?
oh , ali .
what did you do ?
if there &apos;s a way in , there &apos;s a way out .
mary drake was in and out of radley
for a significant part of her life .
she was initially institutionalized
for an incident involving the death of a child
who was under mary &apos;s care while she was babysitting .
there were no charges ever filed
but she was forced to stay in radley until she was 18 .
and then she was readmitted several times
until she got out for good 23 years ago .
so she was the babysitter from hell ?
you guys , that was mona . mary just left the lost woods .
she needs backup . now .
emily , what is this about ?
i lied to you earlier , aria .
i did see ali
and i &apos;m pretty sure she confessed to killing charlotte .
did you record it ?
no , it all happened so fast and ..
... i wasn &apos;t expecting her to say that she did it .
i was the holdout earlier .
i didn &apos;t write down ali &apos;s name
because i didn &apos;t wanna believe that it was her .
look , this is all great , emily , but the clock is ticking
and it doesn &apos;t help us . we still can &apos;t prove it .
when i was staying with ali , she told me she was packing up
some stuff to give to goodwill .
i didn &apos;t know it would be in there .
i just had a hunch .
before we hand it over to a.d.
can we please go over this one more time ?
i love hanna just as much as you all do .
but we &apos;re about to hand over one of our own for another .
but it &apos;s different , em .
hanna is innocent , ali is not .
look , we know that ali is a master manipulator
but i don &apos;t believe that she &apos;s a cold @-@ blooded killer .
whatever happened that night , i believe
that she was protecting herself , but she still killed charlotte .
we don &apos;t have time to debate this .
right now , alison is safely locked up at welby
and hanna &apos;s life is on the line .
we need to get that jacket to a.d.
caleb ?
he &apos;s gone .
how does he know where to go ?
he took my phone .
where are you ?
we lost mary .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i have what i need to get hanna back .
help !
help ! please ! help me !
help ! help ! please , stop !
stop , please .
have you heard anything ?
not yet . radio silence .
one of us should go to welby to check on ali .
we did the right thing . she &apos;s in a safe place .
yeah , welby is locked up like fort knox , em .
i know . you &apos;re right .
how are you feeling ?
maybe a little crazy ?
don &apos;t worry .
i am going to take care of you .
i &apos;m gonna make sure you live a long life ..
... rotting away in here .
i know you killed charlotte .
just like you , alison
karma can be such a bitch .
