if i know my smithsonian folkways ,
that was an appalachian folk song .
well , i &apos;m from lickskillet , kentucky ,
just shy of the appalachia trail .
really ? oh , i love , love , love indigenous mountain music .
well , isn &apos;t that fascinatin &apos; ?
i &apos;m glad you liked the song .
yes . i liked it very , very , very m ...
oh ! you want money .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t have any .
i &apos;m also a musician .
but you can stay in our house .
ha @-@ ha ! it &apos;s a deal ! back in the boy &apos;s closet .
no , hettie . you &apos;re a human being .
you can sleep in my closet .
hmm . well , la @-@ di @-@ da .
how much you charge ?
nothing . maybe we can talk a little music .
ugh . boy , what &apos;s your price again ?
okay , we &apos;ll only talk about it if you want to !
but it would be an honor .
okay , let &apos;s go .
oh , you &apos;ve hurt yourself .
uh , nope , that &apos;s syrup .
oh , let me find you a wet @-@ nap .
i just woke up from a wet nap .
okay . conversation &apos;s over .
check , one , two .
all right . no , no , no , leave the windows open .
i like crickets and night breeze in my music .
they do well together .
have you always been musical ?
you know , first sound i ever heard was my daddy fiddlin &apos; .
his name was bascom lee boggs .
bascom lee boggs ? !
he played with some seminal appalachian bands ,
like snug and the cousin huggers ,
lead paint larry and the drooly boys ,
howlin &apos; sue and her vestigial organ ,
and bloody mary and the coalmine canaries .
did your daddy teach you to fiddle ?
no .
he was gonna start me out on the cigar box banjo ,
but , uh , before he could , he @-@ he lost his sight .
oh , no . i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , he got shot in the face .
you know them puzzles where you slide the tiles ?
he looks a little like that now .
my mother was an amazing banjo player .
unfortunately , she did also go blind .
really ?
yeah , it was winter and she was runnin &apos; a fever
and , um , then she got shot in the face .
oh , wow . hettie , you &apos;ve had such a sad life .
but you know what ? that &apos;s gonna turn around
when i show the world what it &apos;s missing in you .
well , i don &apos;t know if the world &apos;s gonna get me ,
but , child , it sure feels good to know that you do .
you &apos;re having a moment with someone
who has so few moments .
this will never be forgotten .
oh , baby girl , i feel like i &apos;m back home in poorest appalachia .
thank you .
okay . and three , two , one ...
* oh , barnes &amp; noble *
* oh , i am sorry to see *
* that your store *
* has been shuttered *
* i miss your bathroom policy *
* i would sleep in your stalls *
* for many a long day *
it &apos;s lovely , but i want you to know
i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve truly come to hate music .
that is so sad .
i wanted to arrange a concert in springfield park .
we needed the school &apos;s lights and sound system .
lights ? sweetie , you don &apos;t know a fresnel from a gobo .
well , i think you &apos;ll help me every way you can .
and why , pray tell , is that ?
because deep down , there &apos;s still a part of you
that remembers music can be magical .
you &apos;re right .
i can &apos;t bear to kill your passion .
it will live at least until third grade ,
when you get mrs. ortner .
so , i got back together with jeff .
then , of course , i realized there was a reason we broke up .
that sounds awful , and you look stupid doing it .
hettie , hettie , i have a surprise for you !
oh , well , barbecue my bedbugs .
that is glorious .
to pay for it , i sold my malibu stacys .
which , from a feminist perspective , was long overdue .
but i have a ken that i &apos;m transitioning to a stacy .
try it on , try it on , try it on !
i heard you the second time !
why , thank you , your majesty ,
i will have another cup of soda .
lis , lis , lis .
what ? !
i &apos;ve seen you like this before , and it ends badly .
she is gonna break your heart .
and your heart &apos;s as tough as a soap bubble .
remember how upset you got over that dead plant ?
oh . it &apos;s the seven @-@ month anniversary of that .
oh , geez , here we go again .
ugh . you know what , bart ? just get out !
and get dad &apos;s keys and drive us to the radio station .
and then get out ! wait until we &apos;re done .
then drive us back . then get out !
damn it !
hello , homer . i need to do the laundry .
uh , uh , i &apos;ll do it ! oh .
you idiot . now we &apos;ll always have to do the laundry !
i &apos;ll do it wrong so she &apos;ll never ask again .
homer , you &apos;re a genius !
thanks , brain !
oh , i &apos;m not your brain . i &apos;m a blood clot .
okay . i &apos;m goin &apos; in .
thank god i never put in that insulation .
i glide silently through the wall .
silently , ever silently .
ooh , rogue nails ! oh .
hot pipe !
gah . it &apos;s ... oh .
rough tongue ! aah !
oh , that &apos;s just ...
aw , crap .
sure am glad we don &apos;t have a horse .
welcome back to mountain trax .
i &apos;m here today with the one and only miss hettie mae boggs ,
the baby of the boggs family .
well , i &apos;m a little big for a baby .
although my mother did have a 21 @-@ pounder .
charming . does anyone on this station talk
like they &apos;re not at a funeral ?
no . i &apos;m afraid we all do .
so , hettie , you &apos;re doing a concert tonight .
yes , she is .
could you tell our listeners
why you didn &apos;t perform with your older brothers and sisters ?
i mean , they would ask me to . they would ...
they &apos;d say , &quot; hettie , come over here ,
pick up a banjo and play a song with us . &quot;
and , um , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;d say , &quot; no , i &apos;m happy just to sit down by the creek
and do my heroin . &quot; you know ?
wait . what ?
is it also true you &apos;ve been discovered by ,
and then turned your back on ,
well @-@ meaning supporters time and time again ?
uh , yes , yeah , that is a pattern i adhere to ,
and do you have any oxycontin ?
now , if you got some , you don &apos;t have to say yes .
you just got to blink .
maybe we should take a break .
for the record , i &apos;m not blinking .
he &apos;s holding . he just won &apos;t share .
no , no , hettie , please tell me that you &apos;re rehabilitated .
please tell me that you &apos;re talking about heroin
so that no one else will follow in your footsteps .
please reassure me because i am frightened .
oh , baby girl , i wouldn &apos;t let you down .
you and me-- we get each other , yeah ?
but if i don &apos;t get something sweet ,
i might shoot someone in the face .
are you saying that you shot your parents in the face ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s not really the kind of thing you remember .
you know what i mean ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna go now . bye .
lis , if she shoots your face off tomorrow ,
just remember this is what it looks like .
发送
she is not going to let me down !
she is not !
i am saving her .
okay , you &apos;ve convinced me .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
so , how &apos;d it go at the co @-@ ed kickball championship ?
all a lie !
lisa &apos;s been hiding a dangerous heroin addict in her closet !
you were hiding her in your closet , too !
i was renting week @-@ to @-@ week !
homer , do you know what was going on in our house ?
why are you asking meow-- i mean , me now ?
homer , i know about the cat .
i also know about the dog . he &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ve been taking care of everything .
you knew ?
it was pretty sexy pretending you were toolsy .
but lisa let a strange kentucky lady live in our house
without our permission .
well , now i don &apos;t know where she is , and i believed in her ,
and we have a concert in 30 minutes .
oh , honey , we &apos;ll find her .
you entertain the audience till we get there .
okay , i &apos;ll play my sax !
well , that &apos;ll turn a disappointed crowd into a lynch mob .
shut up .
okay , if you want to find this woman ,
and i recommend you don &apos;t , here &apos;s a little clue .
hettie usually smells like radiator booze .
to cletus country !
hettie , we need to get you up ,
run you through a car wash and get you to that concert .
you hush up now !
fortunately for you , i &apos;m fluent in drunk .
now , come on , get up .
you &apos;re gonna get up and ...
and backtalk .
nobody tell me what to do .
not you , not the po @-@ lice .
not even the police .
cletus , why did you give her a shotgun ?
hey , i do not give anyone firearms .
now , she must &apos;ve taken that out the umbrella stand .
oh , your little girl &apos;s been so good to me .
i can &apos;t shoot you in the face .
i &apos;ll just make you deaf for a week .
oh ! i have church tomorrow .
can you do the other ?
thank you !
give it up ! she isn &apos;t coming !
you &apos;ve just made a very powerful enemy-- npr .
our revenge is made possible by listeners like you .
hello , springfield !
they &apos;re gone , and i am never , ever gonna forgive you .
