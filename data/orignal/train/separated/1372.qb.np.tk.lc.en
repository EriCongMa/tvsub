funny thing . you have mud covering both of your --
green tea with honey , and a redeye , three extra shots .
thank you .
you &apos;re drinking four shots of espresso .
yeah , &apos; cause these stupid cups don &apos;t hold five .
so i can take that to mean that you &apos;re not sleeping ?
almost every time i close my eyes , i see her face .
i know . so do i.
i just can &apos;t believe alice got out of jail .
i mean , we were so close .
how does that make you feel ?
bad .
and mad .
and sad .
strong feelings .
you care to explore them ?
they &apos;re pretty simple .
well , but what &apos;s behind them is not .
and you have been through so much .
i mean , look inside . what do you see ?
i &apos;m even madder and ...
sadder .
nothing else ?
no , i --
i don &apos;t know why this woman is obsessed with me .
i talked to her once at the police academy .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;ve done or what she thinks i &apos;ve done .
i just -- i don &apos;t where she is ,
and until i have answers , i just --
this is it .
bad , sad , mad .
exactly .
thanks for understanding .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go .
well , what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna go find her .
it was nice having coffee with you .
yeah , good talk .
four years for possession with intent to distribute .
so alice sands is a drug dealer .
that explains where she got all the cash
to be able to screw with my life .
i called paul o &apos;connell . from the drug unit .
yeah , he &apos;s the guy that arrested alice and put her in prison .
he &apos;s expecting you .
okay . great .
well , the guard who supervised alice sands &apos; release
saw her get into a gold plymouth satellite ,
but he didn &apos;t get a plate .
they stopped making those in 1975 .
great .
i &apos;ll put out a bolo
for the make , model , and color .
he get a look at the driver who picked her up ?
no . but we &apos;re pulling video that might have caught an image .
now that alice sands is out ,
i want to arrange protection , jane .
no .
no , the last time you did that ,
i ended up in an apartment all by myself .
jane .
what -- you &apos;re getting married today .
can &apos;t miss that .
can i ?
wha-- i --
that &apos;s what i thought .
we only caught her because we got lucky .
she was pulled over on a routine traffic stop ,
and there was a bag in the trunk with enough cocaine in it
to bring her up on intent to distribute .
but before that ,
she &apos;s never been on our radar in any way .
okay , well , what about the rest of her operation ?
well , she didn &apos;t give up any information on it .
i mean , we dug around -- looked into possible associates .
we came up with nothing .
so you couldn &apos;t shut it down ?
no .
if her organization exists , it &apos;s deep , deep underground .
well , there &apos;s got to be something .
i mean , a paper trail
or something from another investigation .
i &apos;m sorry , detective . i got to go . i &apos;m on a stakeout .
good luck finding a drug ring that the drug unit couldn &apos;t .
it &apos;s hard to believe that &apos;s alice sands &apos; dad .
yep .
波士顿警察帮助联调局破获贩卖人口团伙
supercop .
damn straight .
someone should make a movie about him .
no one would believe it . this guy was amazing .
and his brother . his dad , too .
the fantastic three .
why did alice break the mold ?
because marvel had the rights to &quot; fantastic four ? &quot;
nerd humor . nice .
so i left four messages for detective mcfadden ,
and i finally got one back -- &quot; leave me alone . &quot;
i &apos;ll go .
you know him ?
no , but i know his language .
you have an address ?
i &apos;ll text it to you .
okay .
what &apos;d you find out from o &apos;connell ?
that alice knew how to keep her drug business completely buried .
we already knew that .
yeah .
did you get a list of her visitors while she was in jail ?
it &apos;s bizarre . she didn &apos;t have any .
what ?
she was there for four years .
not one visitor .
this woman leaves no trace of anything behind her .
jane , we got a hit on the gold plymouth .
it was involved in a murder in maine this morning .
the car belongs to a woman named wendy allen
who was at mci framingham .
the same time as alice ?
cellmates .
wendy was in for prostitution and minor drug charges .
served 11 months . released two weeks ago .
here she is in maine .
both the shooter and wendy are still at large .
that &apos;s wendy coming out of the store
after the trooper is shot .
do we have footage of the driver ?
no .
so we can &apos;t be sure that &apos;s alice sands .
she shot a cop and left her cellmate behind .
that &apos;s her .
tell the locals we &apos;re on our way . come on , frankie .
it &apos;s her turn to be chased .
request permission to expand the search area .
stay with quadrants a and b.
she &apos;s got the river on one side .
we covered the road on the other .
copy that .
gun &apos;s still holstered ,
so he didn &apos;t feel like he was in danger .
single gunshot wound to the chest .
died instantly .
this wasn &apos;t a murder . it was an execution .
i &apos;m sorry . this must be very difficult for you .
we got a good print off the broken wine bottle .
belongs to wendy allen .
uh , we can have our officer in our bric
send you everything we have .
no , we &apos;re good .
are you sure , because ...
get ramirez on it .
trooper , do you have a problem with us being here ?
i never have problems on my crime scenes .
there &apos;s mud underneath his nails .
well , yeah , the security video caught him
wiping it off the license plate .
he couldn &apos;t read the numbers .
yeah , because she covered them up .
well , i &apos;d like to get a sample of this mud .
if we know its origin ,
we know where alice sands was prior to coming here .
our m.e. &apos; s on the way from lewiston .
i &apos;d like him to secure the evidence .
who i &apos;m sure is excellent , but dr. isles is the best .
we &apos;ll handle it .
frederickson , make sure the scene stays fresh .
okay , did your office tell you our connection this case ?
i believe the woman that you &apos;re looking for is alice sands .
she &apos;s an ex @-@ con
who &apos;s been targeting me and my family for weeks .
and trooper juster is like family to me ,
so it &apos;s personal for all of us .
great ! then let &apos;s work together and --
officer .
not long ago , i was abducted .
chloroformed .
my hands were bound .
he hit me .
oh , that &apos;s awful .
all that was done at the behest of the woman we &apos;re chasing ,
who most likely killed your friend .
j.d. , it &apos;s williams .
go .
dogs picked up a scent . quadrant b , west .
we think it &apos;s wendy allen .
on my way . let &apos;s go .
thanks .
frankie .
jane .
i &apos;m gonna take the samples back to boston for analysis .
okay . i &apos;ll see you there .
we need to take her alive .
no guarantees .
who the hell is it ?
oh , come on .
oh , no , no , no . i &apos;m through with cops .
mcfadden , it &apos;s viince korsak .
i brought a friend .
i got scotch .
come on . one drink .
i won &apos;t be long . i &apos;m on the way to a wedding .
really ? who &apos;s getting married ?
i am .
well , good luck .
fourth time &apos;s the charm , huh ?
fourth ?
dewey . it &apos;s j.d.
any visual on the suspect ?
no , sir .
widen the search area .
copy that . proceeding to quadrants c and d.
watch the hunting blinds .
mayor &apos;s citation for bravery .
medal of valor .
police officer of the year ?
yeah , yeah . lots of ribbons and plaques .
nothing for &quot; father of the year . &quot;
i mean , that &apos;s what you want to know about , isn &apos;t it ?
alice comes from a family of decorated cops .
she took a different path .
it &apos;s curious .
it &apos;s a lot more than curious .
this is tragic .
that &apos;s my daughter , detective .
and even so ,
she &apos;d be the one i &apos;d be looking for
if i was still on the force .
nobody &apos;s pointing a finger at you .
well , maybe they should .
look , i think about this all the time .
my alice was perfect in high school .
she was valedictorian , cap--
captain of the softball team .
and there &apos;s every reason to believe
that she would have graduated
first in her class at the academy .
but then , all of a sudden , everything went sideways .
something happen ?
she didn &apos;t do as well as i &apos;d hoped , as she had hoped .
she resigned . i mean , she quit .
she said she didn &apos;t have the heart for it anymore ,
and the only reason why she was there
was because she was , uh --
she was a mcfadden .
what &apos;d alice do after that ?
it wasn &apos;t cop business , so i just didn &apos;t care .
it &apos;s , uh -- after she got arrested ...
i sure learned a lot , didn &apos;t i ?
did you visit her in prison ?
hell , no .
i haven &apos;t talked to alice
since she , uh , got her inmate number .
and nobody in my family has , either .
look , that &apos;s it . that &apos;s everything , all right ?
that &apos;s high school , that &apos;s the academy .
you mind if i take that down to the station ?
please do .
i &apos;ll make sure you get everything back .
no need , detective .
no need .
it &apos;s so romantic .
i mean , this is just all about them .
i think it &apos;s beautiful .
it still makes me --
nervous ?
yes .
why ? do you think i &apos;m going to propose to you ?
what ?
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;re safe .
feel better ?
oh , yeah .
i won &apos;t wear it .
it &apos;s a tiny nod to propriety .
do it for me .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , mimi , but this is for me and vince .
we &apos;re having exactly the wedding we want .
speaking of vince , kiki .
i have some real time restraints today .
yeah , yes . i &apos;ll try him again .
no .
hello , future mrs. korsak .
oh . i am so glad you &apos;re here .
wow . you look --
oh , thank you .
and wow .
you know .
hey , where were you ?
ron was worried .
nothing to do with you .
so it does have to do with me ?
i think i &apos;m gonna get something from the bar .
it &apos;s not open .
sure , it is .
ooh , i can help myself .
are you ready ?
absolutely .
great . let &apos;s do this .
maura called . jane &apos;s gonna be a little late .
oh . uh , where &apos;s maura ?
she &apos;s across at the lab running some tests .
she &apos;ll come over when i give the word .
okay .
vince .
we &apos;re gonna lose judge carter .
everything will be all right .
i &apos;m gonna call jane and get an exact time .
okay .
she &apos;s not picking up .
probably driving . i bet she &apos;s right around the corner .
you &apos;re taller than i expected .
drop the gun .
you know what alice did to me .
can you imagine what she &apos;s gonna do to you
when she doesn &apos;t need you anymore ?
keep talking while you can .
she left you at the station .
she left you out here to fend for yourself .
she &apos;s got a plan .
she tell you that plan ?
shut up .
you better start thinking about yourself , wendy .
because alice only thinks about herself .
she loves me .
like she loved joe harris ?
she had sex with him .
for a man , that &apos;s as good as love .
so she was just using him ?
that &apos;s right .
but she &apos;s not using you ?
shut ... up .
you know what ? fine .
let &apos;s say alice does love you .
she killed a state trooper .
these woods are full of angry troopers .
you getting shot . was that part of the plan ?
i love her .
okay .
but you &apos;re not a killer .
you &apos;re not .
give me the gun .
korsak , i &apos;m so sorry .
well , you had a gun to your head .
it &apos;s not like you stopped to catch a movie .
yeah , i know , but i just -- i still feel bad .
you have that right .
um , just -- i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can , okay ?
eh , what &apos;s a few hours between friends with an open bar ?
i &apos;m making margaritas .
it &apos;s nina . just apologize to kiki for me .
will do .
nina .
wendy &apos;s family owns a cabin an hour from the gas station .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s where they were headed .
it &apos;s about 45 minutes from the canadian border .
i &apos;m sending you the coordinates .
okay , thanks .
where &apos;s miller ?
what do you got ?
gps coordinates for a cabin owned by wendy &apos;s family .
you think alice is there ?
yeah , i think that was her plan .
what surprises me the most
is the moisture retention in this soil .
the ph is decidedly different than the crime scene samples .
are you reading a comic book ?
uh , yeah .
i found them in the high school box .
these &quot; archies &quot; are by far the most interesting .
really ? how so ?
well , in every way .
i mean , this guy &apos;s got a hell of a lot going on .
kent .
of course .
i do have a breakdown
on the organic carbon content of the soil
as well as particle size distribution
and bulk density .
great . i &apos;d like to see it .
you know , i think principal weatherbee &apos;s
far too hard on archie ,
and i don &apos;t believe for one second he &apos;s ex @-@ military .
if i say i agree with you , can we move on ?
of course .
a little space , kent .
there &apos;s no way the mud on those plates is from maine .
no , it &apos;s from the banks of the charles river .
when did you tell alice about the family cabin ?
was it a few months after you met her ?
i &apos;ll bet that you told her
and then quickly , your relationship got physical ,
you wanted alice , she wanted the cabin .
she used you just like she used joe harris .
state troopers are at the cabin .
nobody &apos;s there , but it &apos;s fully stocked
as if two people were gonna be there for a while .
car .
no tracks .
so no car , no alice .
i love her .
she &apos;s not capable of love .
she is .
no , she isn &apos;t .
she only cares about herself .
that &apos;s not true .
wendy , you got to help yourself .
she loved me .
it doesn &apos;t matter now .
it matters .
no .
i matter .
not to her , you didn &apos;t !
i mattered !
me and her son -- we mattered . and nobody else .
she has a son ?
what &apos;s his name ?
wendy , what is his --
frankie .
what &apos;s up ?
alice has a son . call nina .
tell her to look somewhere near the charles river .
i &apos;m sorry , vince .
the law must be served .
you &apos;re a good man .
well , we can debate that later . thanks , man .
jane .
i &apos;m an hour away .
just start the ceremony without me .
don &apos;t bother . we had to send judge carter on his way .
oh , vince .
no , it &apos;s all right .
my best man &apos;s worth waiting for .
and don &apos;t rush . we &apos;ve rescheduled for tomorrow .
where &apos;s alice ?
stay with kiki , okay ? we &apos;ll discuss the case tomorrow .
sorry .
i &apos;m still here .
how &apos;s kiki ?
fine .
really ?
absolutely .
i &apos;m more concerned about you .
don &apos;t be .
nina called . she &apos;s got something .
alice is on the run .
she &apos;s gonna make a mistake ,
and i &apos;m gonna get her , vince . i can feel it .
come on .
i &apos;ve been staring at maps
and thinking about where alice would be going .
the border ? well , she can &apos;t get across .
and we have a bolo on the plymouth .
and an apb for alice . and she knows that .
入境记录 埃斯特科特站- 上午7 : 04
she dyed her hair .
yeah .
now she looks like wendy allen .
because nobody &apos;s looking for wendy allen .
alice , as wendy , walked into canada
at the estcourt station crossing two hours ago .
okay , she &apos;s not dodging us again .
we &apos;ll have the rcmp bring her in .
the mounties will get her .
yeah , i want her here . now .
is this everything , kent ?
uh , yeah .
more &quot; archie &quot; ?
i promise , everything of evidentiary value
is on that wall there .
i do not understand your fascination with these .
it -- they &apos;re all just dating
and flirting and crushes and makeouts .
look .
i went to an all @-@ boys boarding school on a barren heath .
the only girl i ever saw was on a poster for cheese .
these -- they &apos;re a great primer for relationships ,
something i know nothing about .
but it &apos;s just comic books .
oh . here comes jane .
thank god .
well , i guess we &apos;ll continue our conversation later , betty .
and i &apos;ll see you later , too , veronica .
later , jughead . - all right , so you --
please tell me you &apos;ve got something good .
i &apos;ve created a psychological profile of alice sands .
i thought if you could better understand
the way she thought --
i could figure out what she was gonna do next .
fantastic .
alice sands , the high school student , was popular .
homecoming queen .
smart .
valedictorian .
national honor society . wow .
and driven .
&quot; i want to be the first woman president
or the president of the corporation that makes that happen . &quot;
all right .
she came from a family of highly decorated police officers ,
which creates a conflict .
when she joined the police academy ,
she assumed that she would excel ,
but she didn &apos;t .
she struggled because you were there .
wh -- me ? i didn &apos;t even know her .
well , she knew you ,
and she recorded your time in the mile ,
your test scores ,
all of which were faster and higher than hers .
you can graduate number two and still be a good cop .
well , for alice sands ,
anything less than number one was a failure
to herself and to her family .
some rough life .
based on this profile , alice &apos;s fixation with you ,
the seeds of which were planted in the police academy ,
bloomed when she was in prison .
cut off from her family ,
she lost all connection to who she was .
and she had a lot of time to think .
a narcissistic high achiever
needs somebody to blame when things go wrong .
and alice sands believes that you &apos;re the reason
that her life didn &apos;t go as planned .
i just don &apos;t think she &apos;s gonna stop coming after you , jane .
i think you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , don &apos;t be . this is great .
jane .
wait . jane .
what are you going to do ?
i don &apos;t know .
what does the target of an obsessive narcissist do
to draw their attention ?
this is a bad road .
well , i didn &apos;t pick this road .
i &apos;m sure as hell not gonna let her drive .
wedding . yes . going to get ready .
don &apos;t . i just sent kiki home .
why ? did you call it off ?
postponed .
frankie and nina found alice sands &apos; son .
eric stone visited wendy
every single week she was incarcerated .
and when wendy was released , he visited joanne scott ,
the cellmate who replaced her .
in alice sands &apos; cell .
because he wasn &apos;t visiting wendy .
he was visiting alice .
do you know where we can find him ?
i do .
波士顿剑桥大学
&quot; bcu -- a renowned institute of higher learning
located by the beautiful charles river .
where you can get a great education
in an historic setting . &quot;
and mud for your license plate .
all right , look . we &apos;ll divide and conquer .
tonight . 7 : 00 at the libes ?
excuse me . eric stone ?
alice sands &apos; son ?
that &apos;s a yes .
take it easy .
eric stone .
anthropology major .
dean &apos;s list . service award .
doesn &apos;t add up .
why ? because of my mother ?
alice sands isn &apos;t actually your mother .
biologically ? no .
legally , no . you were never adopted .
and yet on your college registration forms ,
it says , &quot; emergency contact :
alice sands , mother . &quot;
we don &apos;t have papers , but she &apos;s my mother .
she saved my life , took care of me ,
set me on the right path .
she loves me .
we &apos;re listening .
i never knew my dad .
i was 5 when my mon od &apos;d .
i bounced around between relatives .
when i was 14 , my cousin freddie had me on the street
as a lookout while he sold drugs .
alice lived in the neighborhood .
she took me in .
and were you a part of her drug business ?
she &apos;s a legitimate businesswoman .
they why &apos;d you run ?
you framed her , you can frame me .
she wasn &apos;t framed .
look .
alice put me on the right track ,
made me stay in school , paid my tuition .
okay , and then she turned to crime .
no , she was framed .
by who ?
cops .
what cops ?
i don &apos;t know , but that &apos;s what she told me .
she was in jail because of cops .
she &apos;s a great woman , my mother .
the best .
hey . got some news .
alice sands was spotted getting off a bus in quebec city .
they &apos;ve tracked her to a warehouse district .
they &apos;ve cordoned off a two @-@ block radius .
as soon as backup arrives , they &apos;ll move in .
got to love the mounties .
yeah , let us know as soon as they have her .
will do .
thanks , frankie .
yeah .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;ll make sure the extradition goes quickly .
great .
i don &apos;t get alice sands at all .
bad person that did something good with this kid .
do you think she has legitimate businesses ?
looking to change ?
turn back into the alice she was supposed to be ?
or these legitimate businesses
were just a cover for her drug operation .
i think she killed a cop . that &apos;s my bet .
to say the least .
hey , kiki .
okay .
well , let &apos;s talk .
all right .
everything all right ?
i &apos;m not sure .
guess when you postpone your wedding twice ,
a person could have some questions .
well , go . talk to her .
are you going back in ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna let him sit for a while ,
have nina check out these legitimate businesses ,
start to dismantle her organization .
that &apos;s not what i said .
i would never tell you to draw a sociopath to you .
well , that &apos;s what i heard .
well , you heard what you wanted to hear .
doesn &apos;t everybody ?
not like you .
that &apos;s not true .
okay .
i just want you to stay in one piece .
okay , well , that we can agree on .
hi , ma .
hi !
can you , um , describe me ?
what ?
just , you know , like what kind of person you think i am .
uh , what &apos;s going on ?
jane is trying to figure out
why this alice sands is so obsessed with her .
oh . okay .
someone with your confidence and drive
can seem like a complete mystery
to a person who lacks one or the other .
so therefore , they feel intimidated .
that &apos;s the non @-@ clinical version , and she &apos;s right .
i don &apos;t mean to be intimidating .
but you are .
yeah , you don &apos;t mean to be a pain in the ass , either ,
but sometimes i --
yes , i wonder where i got that .
it &apos;s a mystery .
oh , there &apos;s something going on with korsak and kiki .
this looks serious .
oh . he looks angry .
no , no , no . that &apos;s just his face .
we have an announcement .
it &apos;s kind of a big one , if we could get your attention .
what ? it &apos;s beautiful .
ron , do you think you could help out ?
okay .
who &apos;s that ?
okay . here we go .
the sister .
we both realized that given what i do ,
there will always be another emergency .
yes .
and we &apos;ve tried to keep this wedding as simple as possible ,
which hasn &apos;t worked .
you &apos;re not canceling the wedding .
we &apos;re getting married in 20 minutes .
judge carter &apos;s on the way .
yeah !
yes , and i &apos;ll make coffee for mimi .
i &apos;ll throw some water on her .
and i have to change .
yes . oh ! so do i !
okay . bye , ma .
bye .
do you have a dress in a drawer ?
maybe . where &apos;s yours ?
evidence locker .
any word from the mounties ?
they &apos;re getting ready to move in .
which i just told my sister two minutes ago .
i &apos;ll tell her again .
i tracked eric stone &apos;s bcu tuition check
to an &quot; s &quot; corp controlled by alice sands .
that led me down this trail .
&quot; quincy street investments .
west end appliances .
new brunswick woodworks . &quot;
these are legitimate ?
seems like it ,
but their origin ,
tax information that details what they do ,
it &apos;s all buried under layers of shell corporations
and registering agents .
why would you do that if they &apos;re clean ?
because you &apos;re using them for things that aren &apos;t .
wedding &apos;s on .
yes , it is . i &apos;m getting my hat .
okay .
wait . you have a special wedding hat ?
it &apos;s just a little hat .
it &apos;s only right for weddings .
you know , those canadian businesses might make it easier
to move things across the border .
nice .
thank you .
aren &apos;t you coming ?
oh , yeah .
i just got to call nicole . she &apos;s coming .
great .
it is great , right ?
that &apos;s what i said . why wouldn &apos;t it be ?
i don &apos;t know . i just thought you should know .
now i know .
great .
see you there .
yeah .
kiki--
wait . sorry .
can we all just make sure that our cellphones are off ?
thank you , jane .
kiki .
when i &apos;m not with you ,
i will be waiting for you .
you will always be in my life .
vince .
how did i get so lucky ?
by the power vested in me
by the commonwealth of massachusetts ,
i now pronounce you vince and kiki korsak .
it &apos;s official !
out of sin !
so what do you think ?
slim pickings . mm @-@ hmm .
just got slimmer .
did i miss it ?
god .
yes .
oh , god . the pleats take forever to iron .
oh , kent . you &apos;re wearing a dress .
no , jane . it &apos;s a kilt .
and this kilt needs swinging .
no .
fine . suit yourself .
not too much swinging , all right ?
oh , god .
you know they don &apos;t wear anything under those ?
yes , i know that .
uh , you need to go that way .
get up . go .
goodbye . now . hurry . go .
you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
you &apos;ll never know , dear , how much i love you
please don &apos;t take
he &apos;s killing me .
my sunshine away
i can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;ve got the ocean in my eyes .
what ?
uh @-@ oh . look out !
home ! yeah !
