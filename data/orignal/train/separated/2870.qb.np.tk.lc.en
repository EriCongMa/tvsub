i cannot believe that you didn &apos;t tell me we are still married !
look , i was going to tell you .
when ? after the birth of our first secret child ?
ross didn &apos;t get the annulment . we are still married !
you &apos;re kidding .
oh , my god !
it wasn &apos;t my best decision ,
but i couldn &apos;t face another failed marriage .
at what point did you think this was a successful marriage ?
rach , come on . if you think about it , it &apos;s actually kind of funny .
maybe it &apos;s best not to think about it .
this is inexcusable . i &apos;m shocked to my very core .
phoebe , i told her you already knew .
another lie . you have a sickness !
for my own peace of mind , are you married to any more of us ?
look , rach , i was going to tell you.i just wanted to do it in my own way .
yes , silently , with no words .
look , in ross &apos; defense , okay ....
the one with joey &apos;s porsche
someone left their keys.to a porsche .
are these yours ?
yeah . that &apos;s what i drive .
i make 4 bucks an hour . i saved up for 350 years .
na @-@ uh
did anybody lose their keys ?
put them in the lost and found .
there &apos;s a lost and found ?
my shoe !
you left a shoe here ?
i didn &apos;t realize till i got home .
i wasn &apos;t gonna walk back with one shoe .
i &apos;ll go find that guy &apos;s car and leave a note on the windshield .
when he comes back for his keys , i &apos;ll give him your shoe .
great . thanks .
oh , good . you guys are here . listen .
how would you like to spend tomorrow taking care of three cute puppies ?
my god ! what a fun day ! sounds great ! yeah , all right .
i &apos;ll bring them by tomorrow morning .
by the way , they &apos;re not actually puppies.they &apos;re frank and alice &apos;s triplets . see you
what ?
please , please , please ? frank and alice ...
asked me to baby @-@ sit them . i &apos;m nervous . i &apos;ve never done that .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll do it .
i &apos;m gonna pass , because i was kind of iffy when it was puppies .
come on , chandler . it &apos;ll give us great practice for when ...
people with babies come to visit .
it &apos;s not that one
so i still have boxes here.i still have boxes at ross &apos; .
and i have nowhere to live.i could so easily freak out right now .
what about me ? denise is leaving town for a while . i don &apos;t have a roommate .
well , maybe i could be your roommate , phoebe.maybe you could be my roommate !
well , there &apos;s an idea !
that would be great ! how long is denise gone for ?
she said she &apos;d be back december 26th .
december 26th.maybe she &apos;s santa claus .
oh , look who it is . my husband , the apple of my eye .
okay , i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2 ... and i picked up all the forms .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
sure , if you say you &apos;ll take care of it , i have no reason to doubt you .
give me those forms .
i &apos;m gonna do this my way and i don &apos;t wanna hear a peep out of you .
okay , rach , but ..
you &apos;re peeping !
ross , i just got .. why did you do this ?
i told you .. -i don &apos;t wanna hear &quot; three failed marriages . &quot;
if you &apos;d had two failed marriages , you &apos;d understand .
thanks to you , i &apos;m halfway there .
oh , i am so mad , ross ! i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever been this angry !
what about when i said we were on a break ?
nice car .
yeah , it &apos;s not mine .
i love your car .
yeah , it &apos;s mine .
i bet it &apos;s fast .
me too . yeah .
and comfortable.you like leather seats ?
yeah .
it &apos;s got them !
phoebe , how &apos;s it going ? i &apos;m okay .
are they having fun ? am i talking too fast ?
no . you sound like me .
it &apos;s going great . look at chandler with little baby girl chandler .
little baby girl chandler . where have i heard that before ?
oh , coach rubin .
phoebe , when you &apos;re done over there , we &apos;ve got a situation over here too .
no . we are all responsible for our own babies .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
we &apos;ve been playing them man @-@ to @-@ man.we should really be playing a zone defense .
what do you mean ? things &apos;ll go smoother if we each have a zone .
phoebe , be in charge of wiping .
mon , be in charge of diapering .
i &apos;ll be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands ...
sounds great , but you should be in charge of wiping .
okay , i &apos;m a rookie . i should not be in the end zone .
this is so great . this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant .
yeah ? well , this is not what i ordered .
hey , guys .
hey , babies .
i &apos;m having the best morning.that porsche i &apos;ve got the keys to ? still there .
shocking , since you still have the keys .
you should see the treatment i get with that car .
people are friendly . they wanna talk .
and not just about the car.one guy advised me on my equity investments .
what equity investments ?
the ones that got me the porsche . will you keep up ?
if people see me just standing there , they &apos;re gonna think i don &apos;t own it .
so i figure i &apos;ll wash it . monica , you got a bucket and soap ?
oh , yeah . i got soap and sponges and rags ... and carnauba wax and polishing compound .
you don &apos;t even have a car .
i know . once there was a dirty car in front of the building , so i washed it .
and ?
and six others.there you are .
yeah , she tops out at 130 .
that &apos;s just in the city . i get her up to 160 upstate .
really ? you got a place upstate ? sure .
all right . see you later .
okay . take it easy .
hey . that &apos;s my car .
really ? just give me five more minutes .
what are you doing ?
i found the keys and now i &apos;m just polishing her up .
but it &apos;s my car .
yeah , but it &apos;s my wax .
listen , i don &apos;t come to the city much .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re crazy or if this is some street theater ...
but could i have my keys ? sure . yeah .
i &apos;ll save your parking spot.i &apos;m not coming back .
why not ?
i live upstate .
yeah , so did i.
i don &apos;t know why i was so nervous ...
and why frank and alice complain . this is easy .
yeah , two hours , a lifetime , that &apos;s the same .
check it out ! when the babies wake up ... they can meet krog !
that thing could put someone &apos;s eye out .
he can do more than that . he can destroy the universe .
they could swallow one of those little parts .
also , look at his smooth area . that &apos;s just gonna mess them up .
it &apos;s just not an appropriate toy for 1 @-@ year @-@ olds . or 30 @-@ year @-@ olds .
they won &apos;t swallow anything . you &apos;re too overprotective .
when i was a kid , my mom used to throw me into a pile of broken glass .
what ?
glass , sand , whatever .
look at little leslie stretching in her sleep.oh , it &apos;s so cute .
i wonder when you stop putting both legs behind your head .
i can still do that .
how are you still single ?
i thought about it and maybe you &apos;re right . maybe krog is not a safe toy .
what made you change your mind ?
i swallowed his sonic blaster gun .
how did that happen ?
i was trying to prove that i was right.and it turns out i was wrong
and now it &apos;s lodged in my throat .
this whole time we were concentrating on the babies ... and no one was watching chandler !
you are asking the court for an annulment ?
yes , your honor . here are our forms , all filled out .
so based on your petition ...
you are seeking an annulment on the grounds ... that &quot; mr. geller is mentally unstable . &quot;
fine . i &apos;m mentally unstable .
and based on the fact that &quot; mr. geller is an intravenous drug user . &quot;
what ?
yes . heroin and crack .
crack isn &apos;t even an intravenous drug.well , you would know .
now , it also says here that you ... &quot; lied about your sexual preference before marriage . &quot;
oh , come on.ross , please . i found the magazines .
and finally , that you were &quot; unable to consummate the marriage . &quot;
well , that makes sense since you &apos;re gay and addicted to heroin .
you know , i &apos;m sorry , this is insane .
i &apos;m not addicted to heroin , i &apos;m not gay and there is no problem ...
with my ability to consummate anything .
i &apos;ll consummate this marriage right here , right now !
that won &apos;t be necessary .
and when we were dating , we consummated like bunnies .
if you were involved in a serious relationship , that creates a problem .
rest assured , that relationship ended two years ago .
strike &quot; consummated like bunnies &quot; from the record .
is there anything in this record that is actually true ?
well , yes . we got married in vegas.and the names , i think .
that &apos;s not the way the legal system works .
this process is based on an objective review of the facts , not of the lies .
objection !
it doesn &apos;t work like that either .
overruled.oh , stop it .
based on what i &apos;ve heard , you certainly don &apos;t qualify for an annulment .
if you don &apos;t wanna be together , file for divorce .
that &apos;s great . you happy ? look what you did with your funny , funny form .
what ? me ? what about you and your &quot; consummated like bunnies &quot; nonsense ?
what are you typing that for ?
she said we don &apos;t get the annulment .
don &apos;t type that . what .. stop typing !
stop typing !
&quot; stop typing , stop typing ! &quot;
okay , do you see what you &apos;re keeping me married to ?
get out of my chambers .
lady , here &apos;s the deal .
i came here for an annulment and i &apos;m not leaving here until i get one !
would you like a night in jail ?
thank you for your time .
that porsche guy took his car back .
but you found the keys to his clothes ?
no , i just love the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche .
they &apos;ll think you own one because of the clothes ? of course .
only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn &apos;t have the car .
that is true .
yeah , but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun .
oh , i &apos;ve been there .
i am gonna go drive my porsche .
you know you don &apos;t actually have one .
what are you doing ? i &apos;m in character . will you talk to her ?
i think it just moved . it &apos;s poking me .
we &apos;ll go to the emergency room .
no , you can &apos;t leave me here with them . we &apos;re babysitting .
the babies are asleep . you &apos;ll be okay on your own .
you can &apos;t leave me with them . we &apos;re a team .
we &apos;re playing a zone . they &apos;ll triple @-@ team me !
he &apos;s got plastic in his throat . we gotta go to the hospital .
but a doctor won &apos;t be able to help him . and it &apos;s just gonna ... naturally pass through his system in seven years .
i think that &apos;s gum .
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s gun .
this really hurts . let &apos;s go .
but no ! a real man wouldn &apos;t just run to the hospital .
no ! what would krog do ?
why isn &apos;t that valet back with my porsche ?
maybe because you &apos;ve got the keys ?
that was totally your fault .
my fault ? you threatened the judge .
you ripped the paper out of the court reporter &apos;s machine !
that was the only way i could get him to stop typing !
hi . how are the gellers ?
don &apos;t call us that .
the judge wouldn &apos;t let us get an annulment . now we gotta get a divorce !
did a porsche throw up on you ?
it &apos;s &quot; porsche @-@ a &quot; !
me taking care of you is no problem , huh ?
you guys feel safe , right ?
i &apos;m gonna take that spit bubble as a &quot; yeah , i do ! &quot;
let &apos;s get rid of this dirty diaper . i &apos;ll set you up with a clean one .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to scare you . i just have to clean that up .
because , let &apos;s face it , we &apos;re at monica &apos;s .
i broke it . all right . well , that &apos;s just the way things go .
okay . good .
why are there only two of you ? where &apos;s leslie ?
well , you can &apos;t answer . leslie ? where are you , leslie ?
now would be a good time for your first words .
well , look at you !
you are a little bit mischievous . my gosh !
oh , you &apos;re a lot mischievous .
well , it &apos;ll dry .
you sit with your brother and sister now ... who aren &apos;t there .
how do you feel ?
let &apos;s just say krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again ... in 12 to 14 hours .
i totally took care of the babies all by myself.i fed them , bathed them and put them to bed .
and protected them from a tornado ?
oh , my god ! i know . the babies are asleep .
phoebe , what happened here ?
i did it . i took care of the babies all by myself .
but my apartment !
was the setting of phoebe &apos;s triumph .
but the mess ! is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies .
you &apos;re right . i shouldn &apos;t freak out .
this is what it &apos;ll be like when we have babies . when &apos;s that ?
phoebe , look at this mess !
oh , honey . thank god you &apos;re home . i was getting worried .
i picked up the divorce papers .
i &apos;ve already signed everything . i put little x &apos;s where you need to sign .
little x &apos;s . great ! that makes up for everything .
you know , you &apos;ve done a lot of stupid stuff too , okay ?
name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one .
how about you flew to london to stop my wedding ?
you told me you loved me after i was married .
wait , that was different . i did those things because i was in love with you .
right .
you &apos;re right . that &apos;s very different.so let &apos;s just sign the papers .
what ? nothing .
okay , can we just sign , please ?
congratulations .
okay , wait , ross . wait a minute .
i kind of have a little confession.what ?
well , you know , this whole marriage thing.kind of my idea .
excuse me ? remember how we were too drunk to remember anything when we were married ?
ya ?
i didn &apos;t really wanna say anything , but it just kept coming back to me .
we were in the casino and you thought it &apos;d be funny to eat a lot of grapes .
and i thought it would be funnier if we got married .
so as a compromise we decided first to get married and then ... to eat a lot of grapes .
sorry i got us into this whole thing .
so then if you think about it ... this is all your fault .
yeah , don &apos;t push it , though .
i gotta say ... i know i divorce a lot of women .
never thought i &apos;d be divorcing you .
i know.i always thought if we got married , that &apos;d be the one that stuck .
and it wouldn &apos;t be a secret ... and we wouldn &apos;t have our wedding dinner at pizza hut .
did i even treat ?
no , it was on the house . it was a newlywed special .
that may be the most depressing thing i &apos;ve heard .
i should get these to my lawyer &apos;s office .
thanks for taking care of all this.no problem .
i &apos;m gonna need a copy of those .
totally .
careful around my porsche !
hi , joey .
hey . how you doing ?
he has the most amazing porsche under there .
i &apos;d show you , but i just tucked her in . she &apos;s sleeping .
