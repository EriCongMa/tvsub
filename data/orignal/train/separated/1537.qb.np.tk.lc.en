well , how do i look ?
big day . i &apos;m going to see alex .
i &apos;m , uh -- i &apos;m a little nervous
because she &apos;s been pulling away lately .
calls don &apos;t get returned .
i don &apos;t get asked to visit as much .
maybe it &apos;s hitting me hard
&apos;cause i never went through that with my dad .
after my junior year ,
we -- we rode a tandem bike across mykonos .
come to think of it ,
there were lots of fathers and sons there .
phil , sit .
we need to talk about the ducks .
we hate the ducks .
again ? you have a problem .
i &apos;m hearing a lot of negatives ,
but we &apos;re overlooking the fact that feathers can now fetch .
honey , she pulled a wet hot dog bun out of the sink ,
and you said , &quot; get the bun . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t count as fetching .
please tell me they &apos;re not gonna live here forever .
you &apos;re really not the one to make that argument .
oh , like you &apos;re not gonna
die of natural causes in that bunk bed upstairs .
look , we have provided them with a good home .
when they &apos;re ready , they &apos;ll leave .
could be any day .
oh , and in the duck &apos;s defense , claire ,
you can &apos;t stick your leg out of your robe at breakfast
and then pretend to hate the attention .
why didn &apos;t you fight harder about the ducks ?
you heard what he said .
the ducks could leave any day now .
yeah , or it could be two months from now .
or any day now .
or a month and a half fr--
how are you not getting this ?
mitch called . he wants to know when are you bringing
the air mattress for lily &apos;s sleepover .
you know , for a guy who refuses to buy his own air mattresses ,
he &apos;s pretty particular about when they arrive .
no , no ! don &apos;t eat my sauce .
then i won &apos;t have enough to sell at the farmers &apos; market .
no . oh , geez . not the fat finger .
you always do this when i put on a few .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
it &apos;s not what you say .
it &apos;s that damn lard dipstick finger of yours .
it disappeared up to the second knuckle .
well , now that that &apos;s over with ,
i can finally share my latest football @-@ related problem .
mitchell &apos;s right . i should probably get a move on .
the team left me out of the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ season prank .
you know , that takes me back .
we told the school board that coach davis was a communist .
the man spent a weekend in jail .
simpler times .
well , that &apos;s better than what these meatheads cooked up .
they just parked the principal &apos;s car
in the middle of the basketball court .
that &apos;s not where cars go .
why didn &apos;t those meatballs include you ?
they think i &apos;m a goody @-@ two @-@ shoes .
i &apos;m not .
my own mother ?
ay , i &apos;m just saying it wouldn &apos;t kill you to break some rules .
you &apos;re a minor . take advantage of it .
i break the rules .
i just prefer to be suave , do it with panache and finesse .
ay , those are american shampoos . i know .
y &apos;all ready for this ?
i got our sauce
into the granddaddy of all holiday gift baskets .
which one ?
it &apos;s called granddaddy &apos;s holiday gift baskets .
very exclusive .
they want 150 jars ...
6 o &apos;clock tonight .
no ! it &apos;s too much sauce for too little time .
and anyways , i don &apos;t have the key ingredient --
the blood peppers .
and my cousin can &apos;t send me more
from colombia until next week .
one spicy step ahead of you .
enter the serrano pepper !
no one will know the difference .
i will .
this sauce is part of my heritage .
i cannot turn my back on who i am .
didn &apos;t your hair used to be darker ?
i &apos;m just saying
this is a great opportunity for our sauce .
&quot; our sauce &quot; ?
all of a sudden , cam is calling it &quot; our sauce &quot; ?
i got that recipe from my great aunt
who got it from her mother who stole it from a blind maid .
how dare he .
fine . we &apos;ll just go get some blood peppers .
they &apos;re impossible to get .
unless you &apos;re willing to break some rules .
why are we back on your thing again ?
they just so happen to grow blood peppers
at the botanical gardens .
great . let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re adorable .
we &apos;re talking rare flora in a secure location .
okay , so , then what do we do ?
first , apologize for calling me a goody @-@ goody ,
because i &apos;m about to lay out a plan so daring
that the two of you may not have the guts to follow it .
should i take my knife ?
i have my baseball bat in my car .
okay , we &apos;re stealing a pepper ,
not teaching its family a lesson .
uh , okay .
i noticed a few of your professors
in those mouth @-@ controlled wheelchairs .
i think some of them are just faking it to try and look cool .
domo arigato , mr. robotics lab !
what ? !
yeah . come check out these gloves . they &apos;re awesome .
any movement , even the slightest motion ,
will be mirrored by the robotic hands .
possible applications are bomb defusement ,
nuclear reactor repair , and remote neurosurgery .
what has two thumbs and any lady robot he wants ?
this guy .
dad , this isn &apos;t a toy .
hello , my loyal robot subjects .
dad ?
jazz hands !
the other robots are staring !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
so , what &apos;s going on at home ?
well , haley and luke aren &apos;t around much .
meanwhile , the ducks are awesome and nobody gets it .
you wouldn &apos;t believe this , but one of them can fetch .
of course i believe it .
one of my professors
taught a chimpanzee how to play the saxophone .
we all think he &apos;s great , but he only plays jazz ,
so there &apos;s no way to tell .
tell me about these fellas .
well , this one &apos;s being developed for the military .
really ?
what about this adorable guy ? hello , switch .
oh , no ! dad , don &apos;t press that .
oh , he &apos;s just going for a little walk .
the master switch !
the what ?
no , no , no !
oh , my god .
it &apos;s happening !
they &apos;re rising up !
turn off !
i command you to turn off !
it &apos;s not working !
i &apos;m on your side !
why would you do that ? !
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking !
i &apos;m so sorry .
great . now the captain of the football team hates me .
okay , follow my plan to the letter ,
and in 10 minutes , we &apos;ll have peppers in hand .
it &apos;s saturday .
william will be working the rose garden .
fortunately , he &apos;ll be distracted .
right now , the aphids have the upper hand .
cam , when you reach the stream ,
follow it south southeast to the hummingbird exhibit .
interact with no one .
excuse me . could you take this for us ?
oh , guess i have a second .
took a picture of myself .
oh , and now it &apos;s your wallpaper .
mom , to avoid detection , take a circuitous route
to the edmund and miriam rabinowitz pepper patch .
take me to the blood peppers .
i &apos;ll re @-@ route the senior citizens &apos; tour ...
you &apos;ve already been this way . you loved it .
so they &apos;re not around when you arrive at the peppers .
go away , boy .
be on alert . there may be added security .
how exhilarating .
i didn &apos;t know there was a caper in our sauce .
how could you ?
it &apos;s not your recipe .
hey , girls . how about a snack ?
i &apos;m hosting a sleepover for lily &apos;s vietnamese dance troupe .
we want her to be more in touch with her heritage ,
but breaking the ice with the other parents
has been a little tough .
cam and i are the only white parents ,
the only gay parents ,
the only parents that find us funny .
come on in , patricia , ms. tran .
the girls are in lily &apos;s room .
oh , this is a fun coincidence .
we actually had a couple trans over for dinner last ni--
the hardest nut to crack
has been little patricia tran &apos;s mother .
i didn &apos;t try her homemade pho at a potluck once ,
and now she doesn &apos;t like me .
you could say it was a little bit of a pho pa .
hello .
your husband ?
my dad .
and i prefer brunettes , without beards .
i like women .
i &apos;ll bring patricia &apos;s medicine over later .
my purse .
she seems nice .
hey , grandpa !
hi , sweetheart !
little tip -- you might want the girls
to blow up these air mattresses ,
tire them out a little bit .
oh , i &apos;m not trying to tire them out .
no . i &apos;m the fun dad , okay ?
i want them to have a good time .
that &apos;s a rookie mistake .
when you and claire were kids ,
i was the sleepover champ , undefeated .
there was never a kid that was awake later than 7 : 30 .
oh , no . i remember my 10th birthday .
you let us wash your car ,
and then we carried the grandfather clock to the dump .
yeah , sun exposure plays a big part .
what &apos;s this stuff ?
uh , mom , uh , mailed me a bunch of stuff from her garage .
she thought i might like a vcr and a bunch of old tapes .
sweet of dede to mail you her garbage .
&quot; jane fonda complete workouts , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not you , it &apos;s him , &quot;
&quot; cooking with chocolate . &quot;
pretty much the arc of our whole marriage .
listen , if you &apos;re smart ,
you &apos;ll let the girls walk this stuff down to goodwill .
or i could provide a fun , entertaining evening
that will only enrich my daughter &apos;s childhood .
daddy , will you judge our screaming contest ?
of course he will ! hit it , girls !
okay ! you won . you all won . it &apos;s a tie .
oh , honey , i am so sorry about what happened in there .
don &apos;t worry about me , but , you know ,
those robots are programmed to hold a grudge .
not how i wanted this to go .
probably gonna be a while
before i get invited back here , huh ?
dad , it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re probably going to be seeing me a lot more ,
considering i want to move back home
and commute to school next semester .
really ?
yeah . it &apos;s only a half @-@ hour drive .
are you mad ?
mad ? are you kidding me ? i &apos;m thrilled .
you know how much i miss you .
we could have our own robot lab in the garage .
how much could that possibly cost ?
but , uh -- but why ? did something happen ?
no , it &apos;s just --
ugh , the people here are all so immature .
they are always banging on your door
with a beaker full of margaritas , and ...
the nerd noise is deafening .
did you bring those noise @-@ canceling headphones i asked mom for ?
oh , i am so sorry . i forgot .
sometimes my brain cancels out your mom &apos;s noise .
i &apos;ll , uh -- i &apos;ll pick some up
while you &apos;re in class and then drop them by the dorm .
thanks .
excuse me .
cannon ball tonight . don &apos;t miss it .
oh , no , no . thanks .
what &apos;s that about ?
oh , it &apos;s just some stupid tradition where ,
at the end of the semester ,
all the freshmen jump off a high dive
in cheesy prom dresses .
oh , that could be fun .
it definitely won &apos;t be .
well , maybe if you give it a chance ...
no . you know what , dad ?
i @-@ i @-@ i did .
i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve already been to like 10 parties ,
and they &apos;re all lame .
everyone just talks to their own dorm mate .
sweetie , sometimes it takes a while to warm up to people .
what is this about ? do you not want me to come home ?
is that what this is ?
because , fine , i &apos;ll just go get an apartment off campus .
alex , don &apos;t get mad .
well , i am mad .
because i &apos;m actually smart enough
to know what &apos;s working for me and what isn &apos;t ,
and this isn &apos;t .
i have to go to class .
heads up ! watch out !
how &apos;d he do that ?
mitchell ?
in the kitchen , grandpa !
vietnamese girls and a man in makeup .
when does bob hope take the stage ?
delightful .
you &apos;re good to go on the air mattresses .
good luck with the sleepover .
yes , ma &apos;am ?
i don &apos;t want to be the fun dad anymore .
i need to knock these girls out quick .
teach me .
let &apos;s go , ladies ! reach to the sky !
how are you better at this than jane fonda ?
mitchell , you can &apos;t talk
and feel the burn at the same time .
donkey @-@ kick like you mean it , jennifer .
i &apos;m just curious , because this tape was on its way to goodwill ,
and all of a sudden , you pulled it out of your back pocket .
i put on a couple of extra pounds ,
and jane got me out of a similar situation in the &quot; 80s .
please tell me you were wearing leg warmers .
leave me alone .
we got this , girls . march it out .
well , for whatever it &apos;s worth , dad , i didn &apos;t notice .
gloria did .
she did that little poke thing to my spare tire .
lily , keep the beat .
i hate to admit it , but it bugged the hell out of me .
kim @-@ ly , we &apos;re punching and we &apos;re stepping .
care to join us ?
so , i figured i &apos;d do this workout every damn day of the week
until i was nothing but abs , buns , and thighs .
work your glutes , tiffany !
this is your problem area .
okay , dad , no offense , but i &apos;ve been listening
to you whine about gaining and losing the same 10 pounds
since , at age 60,
you married the most beautiful woman in the world .
and while i appreciate what might be the rich @-@ white @-@ mannest
of rich @-@ white @-@ man problems ,
this tape is only energizing these little girls .
this is boring .
let &apos;s go and build a fort in my room .
so , what ? you &apos;re just gonna give up ?
you got to know when to surrender .
no , sir .
i &apos;m not losing to the vietnamese twice in a lifetime .
get up .
no man left behind .
look at this golf course . it &apos;s a beautiful home for ducks .
okay , now , who &apos;s gonna help me
set these little suckers free , huh ?
you do it .
i &apos;m good .
oh , come on .
we all hate the ducks . we all want them gone .
why do i have to be the bad guy ?
i don &apos;t know . why am i the pretty one ?
we all have our thing .
fine . fine . i &apos;ll do it .
get on out there . there you go . you &apos;re free . okay .
why aren &apos;t they going anywhere ?
well , miss thing over there is still getting herself ready .
i swear she spent all morning
looking at her reflection in the water bowl .
how about that weirdo ?
did you see when he got his bill stuck in his cage yesterday ?
what a sweet little dope .
i know . he &apos;s lucky his sister is so smart .
you know , she figured out how to unlatch the cage
and set him free .
oh , my god .
do you guys see what &apos;s happening ?
no .
of course you don &apos;t .
the reason why your dad is so attached to these ducks
is they remind him of you guys .
we got to get them home .
they &apos;re gone .
oh , my god .
where are they ?
oh , god .
what the hell ?
does everyone get rid of their ducks here ?
can &apos;t we just pick any three ?
your father will know immediately .
look . i think that might be the dumb luke duck .
the one entertaining the others ?
his head is caught in the fritos bag .
isn &apos;t that your duck ?
where ?
the one pushing oats around with its beak , pretending to eat .
all right . that &apos;s it . go get your ducks . go .
what ? no . it is filthy and filmy .
and that &apos;s before luke even gets in it .
what &apos;s the point in getting two ducks
if we don &apos;t have the third one ?
and how are we supposed to find the alex duck ?
wait until new year &apos;s eve and see which one stays home ?
no . no . you &apos;re right .
we are not going home without all three ducks .
hang on . let &apos;s see if your dad was right .
feather .
feather . fetch .
no way .
don &apos;t just stand there . get your ducks .
i just spent a week &apos;s salary on these shoes .
i &apos;m not -- oh , look at those big brown eyes .
they take up half her face !
i &apos;m coming , princess !
pardon me .
sorry . have fun .
what &apos;s the most dangerous type of uranium cake ?
yellow !
what &apos;s going on ?
i found this inhaler . do you know whose it is ?
there &apos;s only six people here who don &apos;t use those .
they throw them in the air at graduation .
all right .
hey , did you bring those headphones ?
yeah . right here .
thanks .
hey , honey .
i &apos;m sorry about earlier .
i think maybe being on a college campus took me back ,
and some of my own first @-@ year insecurities bubbled up .
i didn &apos;t know anybody , and no matter how hard i tried ,
i was always on the outside .
and then suddenly , one day , something clicked and i was in .
i mean , you never know .
i mean , just because that happened to you ,
doesn &apos;t mean that &apos;s -- - no , no , no , no , no .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s my point .
my story isn &apos;t your story .
as intimidating as this place may be ,
i &apos;ve never seen you walk away from a challenge .
if you tell me you &apos;ve given it your best shot ,
then i know you have .
so don &apos;t be mad at me , okay ?
i &apos;m not mad .
all right , kiddo .
your mom and i will be back next week to pack you up .
i love you .
i love you , too .
bye .
bye .
okay . granddaddy &apos;s truck &apos;s gonna be here in 84 minutes .
so , we &apos;re tightening , we &apos;re stirring , we &apos;re chopping .
bottle it up !
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m just too excited .
you mean the sauce in the -- got it . yes .
cam ...
what is this ?
oh , my gosh .
you weren &apos;t supposed to see these yet .
this is just a potential label idea that i @-@ i had mocked up .
but i am not even on it .
no , you are . yes , you are . see ?
you &apos;re the silhouette right here by the nutritional facts .
that way , people are looking at you
and not the toxic amount of sodium .
i have others , too .
you know , i have one of us on a pepper rocket
on our way to flavor city .
you &apos;re in front of me , and it &apos;s cute .
you know what ? i don &apos;t think this partnership is working .
what are you saying ?
what am i saying ?
this is family &apos;s sauce ,
and you have already tried to change the recipe .
you took a huge order without even asking me .
and now this ?
if i am going to flavor city , i am going by myself .
you &apos;re breaking up with me ?
when i first started dating cam ,
his ex @-@ boyfriend gave me a heads up .
he said , &quot; cam &apos;s a great guy ,
but i hope you never have to break up with him . &quot;
and i said , &quot; why ? does he get angry ,
weepy , jealous , despondent ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
you &apos;re breaking up with me ?
this business was my idea .
i got you into the farmers &apos; market .
i got you into those baskets .
you were nothing but a housewife when i found you .
i didn &apos;t mean that . i &apos;ve always admired you .
being a housewife is the hardest job on the planet .
you &apos;re never not at work .
it &apos;s just -- how did we get to this place ?
unless ...
there &apos;s someone else , isn &apos;t there ?
oh , how could i be so blind ?
let me guess -- somebody with more experience ?
somebody colombian ?
well , you &apos;re no picnic , either .
so , who is it ?
say something !
i &apos;ve seen my mom break up with a lot of guys .
she has this weird power to get them to do all the work .
one minute , they &apos;re a mess .
the next , they &apos;re thanking her
for the best year of their lives .
the last guy helped us move into jay &apos;s house .
you knew .
you knew i needed the motivation to create my own sauce .
you knew all along .
you &apos;re welcome , cam . and don &apos;t worry .
i know that one day , you &apos;re gonna have your sauce
in granddaddy &apos;s basket .
well , that paints a picture .
now , see , there &apos;s lots of stuff here to tire the kids out .
look -- bricks for carrying , shovels for digging .
shovels . when did we get shovels ?
okay , well , whatever you &apos;re doing ,
can you do it someplace else ?
i &apos;m helping gloria bottle her sauce ,
and we &apos;re running out of time .
ay , cam . i think it &apos;s too late .
i don &apos;t think we have enough time to finish .
you might .
oh , ms. tran . is that patricia &apos;s medicine ?
pick up the pace , ladies !
come on ! we &apos;ve only got 20 minutes !
trust me . this is slightly better than it looks .
my fingers hurt .
hey , honey , what did i say about talking on the line ?
okay . let &apos;s just get these ducks back into the garage
as fast as we can , and please be quiet .
i don &apos;t want your father to hear us .
hello .
i got home early and noticed the six of you
had ... ducked out .
well , we know how much you love the ducks ,
and -- and we wanted to play with them , too .
and we -- - and what , claire ?
the craziest thing happened ?
you turned a hard corner , the cage banged open ,
one of them hit the sunroof button ,
and out they flew , leaving us with nothing but an empty --
i interrupted you . go on .
we have not always loved the ducks , phil ,
but i think we &apos;re starting to get it .
yeah . we want them to stay .
we know why you love them .
thank you .
i always knew it was only a matter of time
before these little scamps waddled into your hearts
just like they did mine .
now , come on . help me throw them out the window .
dad , what are you doing ?
it is time for them to go .
but , honey , are you sure they can even fly ?
according to the internet , they were ready a month ago .
at breakfast , you were giving them shoulder rubs .
what happened ?
i realized today that i may have been holding them back
because that was fun for me .
but in the end ,
you got to let them spread their wings , right ?
whoo ! let &apos;s go ! girl !
all right , alex !
all right , guys . let &apos;s do this .
one , two ...
come visit us !
make good choices !
in many ways , you fetched me !
you caught me .
i know they &apos;re not coming back .
sometimes they do .
hello ?
hey , alex .
what &apos;s going on , sweetheart ?
yeah ?
&quot; once the lower spring hinge is secured ,
you can then attach the closet door . &quot;
they &apos;re all sleeping , mitch .
not bad .
45 . room for improvement .
well , it looks like i &apos;m still undefeated .
