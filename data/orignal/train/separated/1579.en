We spoke to Jude's therapist.
Why isn't he talking?
They think it's something
called selective mutism.
It's a coping mechanism.
What are we supposed to do then?
I'm not gonna make a big deal about...
Hey, buddy.
You told Emma about Haley?
Yes.
Why would you tell Haley you were a couple and not tell Emma?
That's none of your business.
This is about you trying to be
like all those other girls.
Are you OK?
Not really, no.
I ate a pot brownie and I am freaking out.
It's OK, you made a mistake.
And tomorrow everything is gonna be back to normal.
No, things will never be normal again.
I slept with Dani.
Dani?
I was gonna have sex with Wyatt today.
I kinda freaked out. All of the sudden,
I couldn't breathe and I just felt like he was gonna crush me.
Maybe you were just nervous.
Or maybe
I'm still in love with Brandon.
I thought you were over him.
Yeah, I thought so too.
Don't give up on Wyatt.
I'm not.
That was Liam. - The foster brother - you told me about?
He forced me to have sex with him.
That's not cool, Callie. You know that, right?
That what he did wasn't cool.
我今天好像看到利亚姆了
Did we overdo it with the pink?
Maybe we shoulda gone more gender neutral.
You know, less sugar and spice and everything nice.
Hm. No daughter of ours is gonna be everything nice.
Speaking of naughty, kids are still asleep.
Mmm. Not all the kids.
Oh, honey, Mama's here.
Mama's here.
Yeah. I think she's hungry.
She's always hungry.
Come here, baby.
You know, she has your lovely long fingers.
And your perfect little flintstone toes.
What's with all the yelling and the door slamming?
Tell Mariana sinking her nose in my business.
I'm sick of you dating about all of my friends.
What friends?
Haley.
You're dating Haley?
No, no. They're having sex.
See? Shut up!
Don't tell your sister to shut up.
Thank you.
And you, shut up about your brother's business!
What happened with Emma?
We broke up.
But now, Emma wants to get back together
and he didn't wanna tell her
about Haley so he can, like, string her along
or something, so I told her.
Are you using condoms?
Mom.
Are you?
Yes, of course.
Gross.
Says the virgin.
OK, enough! No more door slamming.
Mom.
Are you OK?
I'm fine. Just got up a little too fast.
Do your homework.
Hi, Dr. Hillcroft, it's Lena Adams Foster.
I'm sorry to call you on your cell but
I just had a headache all day that I can't shake.
and I was wondering if there was anything I could take?
So could you call me, please, on my cell or text me?
Thanks.
Hey, babe.
Hey, where are you?
Well, I was just getting ready to leave here. Is everything OK?
Yeah, yeah.
Hurry home.
I will.
So how long's this been going on?
Don't make it sound like we're having an affair.
Well, something secret is going on here.
OK, look, I went to the halfway house
the night I slipped, OK?
Yeah, I know. A witness saw you.
What do you mean a witness saw me?
I showed him your picture and he identified you.
You're investigating me?!
Because you were lying.
And you thought what, Stef?
You had been drinking...
What, that I killed her?
...and you had blood on your hands.
He's been helping me.
I've been sober for 60 days now.
It's the longest since I was 15.
So you were doing drugs while you were pregnant with the twins?
That's a low blow.
Why don't we take this outside.
Please.
So, what, Mike? You're her "Sponsor"? Is that it?
You really think I'm capable of murder?
Don't turn this around on me.
Do you know how many nights I have laid awake...
I knew you wouldn't approve...
I don't approve.
That woman has lied, and threatened,
and manipulated my family.
She almost landed you in jail.
She used our son to try and extort us, Mike.
Yes. She's done horrible things, because she's sick.
I don't expect you to understand, you're not an addict.
But she's not a terrible person.
Who's paying for this?
I am but just until she can get a job...
I can't believe how foolish you're being.
You could be charged with witness tampering...
She's not gonna go to the DA.
I want no part of this.
Good. Then stop following me and mind your own business.
Hey, baby, what's going on?
Brandon just took Mama to the emergency room.
What? Why?
She fainted and she was throwing up.
What ER?
Sacred Cross.
I'm on my way.
140 over 90.
Which is good.
It hasn't risen.
It hasn't gone down either.
Ok.
Eight glasses a day, please.
Are you sure you don't want me to call your mother?
No. I'm supposed to avoid stress,
not invite it for the weekend.
Maybe I should call the doctor.
Mm. No. Don't be the boy who cried wolf, please.
If the medication isn't working...
As long as it doesn't go any higher,
the doctor said there's nothing to worry about.
Well, I wouldn't say nothing.
Am I driving you crazy?
A little bit.
OK.
Honey, I love you for taking such good care of me
but you gotta get out of the house.
Go for a run. Go run an errand.
Go get me a veggie burger from Viv's.
OK, all right. If you need anything use this.
I got it from the earthquake kit.
Seriously?
I don't want you having to yell for us.
I... don't know what's going on with her.
Things were really good and then she, like, suddenly pulled away.
And she's not talking to me, really.
She just keeps saying everything's fine but I know it's not.
I'm not really sure what to say.
Is she still hung up on you? I mean... are you guys...?
We're brother and sister.
Not yet.
Look, we're not friends.
And I can't be your couples counselor.
That's not what I'm asking.
What are you asking?
For a little help?
I already helped.
I got out of your way.
Look, nobody gave me a guide to understanding Callie. OK?
If that's even possible.
So...
I don't know, maybe you need to give her some space.
That's all I got.
Thanks for the advice.
Hi, I'm Brian. These are my parents.
We're here to see the bed.
I got this. I'm Jesus.
Hey, I'm selling mom's bed.
The one she's lying in right now?
You can't.
They asked me to.
What's in it for you?
Ten percent.
Mom, I forgot I had people coming to see the bed today.
Should you be up?
I'm supposed to stretch my legs.
And, yeah, it's fine to show the bed.
Well, why does he get to sell the bed?
Why don't you two just work together.
This girl couldn't sell a dollar for fifty cents.
Uh, the 1950's called, they want their joke back.
So is now a good time?
My mom was wondering how long you've had the bed.
Less than six months, it's practically new.
It has a 20 year transferable warranty.
And it's retailed at $6,000.
For 2,500, this is a steal.
Are you clean?
Like, hygienic?
My moms shower before bed every night.
My mom wants to know if you have a husband?
Yes, but he's not home right now. He's working.
I have a wife and...
the bed was a wedding gift but it doesn't suit us.
They're lesbians.
Is that a problem?
It's not a problem.
Great.
Why don't we let the Kims
discuss this privately for a few minutes?
Thank you.
I just want to let you know
there's a lot of interest in this bed.
You're the first people to see it today.
So I'd act fast.
今天能见面吗
Hey, you wanna help?
Thought I'd do some planting for Lena.
She's been so busy at school and now with the baby...
Everything's gonna be fine, it's just a drag, to be on bed rest.
Just plant these ones in rows about, like, six inches apart, OK?
You know...
you've always been so good.
You always held it together. You never lost it.
No matter what bad stuff happened to us.
You're due for a breakdown.
So, don't let me
or anyone else make you feel like you have to talk.
Until you're ready.
It's OK.
OK, special delivery for the sexiest pregnant woman in...
Hi.
Uh, hello.
I'm Brian. Those are my parents
and they're interested in the bed.
Actually, my mom is interested but my dad doesn't like it.
Would you be willing to sell half the bed?
In case you change your mind about splitting the bed.
If someone else wants half, we'll call you.
What?
Way to close the deal.
I'm not selling half a bed.
I'm surprised you didn't just string them along.
Just in case you couldn't decide.
Don't go there.
And by the way, I'm still a virgin
because I want to be, not because I have to be.
Mat. You know Jesus and my sister, the virgin Mariana.
139 over 80.
See? The medication is working.
Yeah, I didn't doubt it for a minute.
But you still have to stay right here and rest.
Not letting anymore strangers up here to see the bed today.
I'm fine. And we have to get rid of this thing.
Especially before the baby comes.
We don't want her falling into the crack.
Oh, so we're co-sleeping, are we?
I kinda think it'd be nice, you know?
I've been reading about attachment parenting...
Yeah, well, you know,
people have been known to roll over on their babies.
We're not heavy drinkers or sleepers.
I'm just saying, it's not recommended.
Can you imagine coming out of the comfort and warmth of the womb
and then being left in a crib all alone?
That's what a swaddle's for.
Brandon slept in a crib and he has turned out just fine.
Hey, Mike and Dani are here.
OK. Stay. Rest. You.
So just heat on 350 for about 30 minutes.
OK, thanks. I appreciate it.
All Dani's idea.
Yeah?
With Lena on bed rest,
I don't want you to have to cook.
Is this like serious?
Not if they get it under control,
but she may be on bed rest for a while.
Is she up for visitors?
Yeah, I think so.
Hey. What're you doing here?
Dani made us dinner. Isn't that nice of her?
Yeah.
We're just going up and say hi to Lena.
Is that a good idea? I mean, she barely knows Dani.
Brandon.
No. He's right.
You should just go, Mike.
You sure?
Yeah. I have to make the salad anyway.
OK. I'll be right back.
Um, can I get a salad bowl?
Yeah, Brandon, will you grab her a salad bowl, please?
Yep.
Thanks.
How you doing?
Much better. Thank you.
Good. I heard you're having a girl.
Yeah.
I'm really happy for you. Both.
That means a lot.
You know, Dani and I are talking about having a baby.
Really?
Yeah, she's younger than me and wants kids.
And I don't know, I wouldn't mind getting another chance.
Maybe do a better job of it this time.
Mike, you're a really good father.
I made a lot of mistakes.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Brandon, um, he loves you very much.
He's made mistakes too.
But he's back on the right track now.
Right?
I should let you rest.
Dani just wanted to drop off her special lasagna for you guys.
Mike.
Yeah?
Thank you.
Thank Dani, she did all the cooking.
Please, thank her for me.
I will.
Your dad is talking about having a baby with Dani.
I need you to know why I'm helping Ana.
I know why.
No, you don't.
I went to the halfway house twice that night.
First, to threaten Ana.
And then, after I drank again...
...I went back, to shut her up.
For good.
Yelling at her didn't make me feel any better.
She still had all the power to destroy my career, maybe yours.
But worst of all, to hurt our son.
I was disgusted with myself.
At least Brandon did something to try to make her go away.
To protect our family. What was I doing? Nothing.
So I went back. I parked outside.
With a bottle and I waited.
And the next thing I remember was Dani found me passed out
in my car in some parking lot somewhere with blood on my hands.
Mike...
Then...
When I found out Ana went missing that night...
I had to find out what happened,
even if it meant I'd done something terrible.
Thank God, I found her alive,
strung out in some crack house.
I was so relieved, that I vowed to myself and to God
that I would do anything I could to help her.
To get her on her feet and get sober.
Because in my heart, I did want to kill her that night.
And that's a sin I need to make amends for, Stef.
And knowing that alcohol put me in that state of mind
is why I'll never have another drink ever again.
Hey, all done?
Yep. Salad's in the fridge.
Thank you.
Hey, let us know if you need anything else.
Will do.
Hey.
Oh. I didn't know you were still here.
What's that?
Geometry.
Are you like a mathlete or something?
I'm on the dance team.
Which makes you better than a mathlete?
No.
Hey, why do you dye your hair?
None of your business.
Don't move.
指受了委屈 好斗 爱吵架的人
What?
There's a chip on your shoulder.
I do not have a chip on my shoulder.
Are you a good dancer?
I don't know. I mean, I'm OK.
I'm not the best.
Why not?
I'm just...
Lazy?
I work harder than anyone on that dance team.
See?
What?
The not a chip thing.
OK, I really need to do my homework.
Do you want to go out sometime?
With you?
Yeah.
Alone, with you?
Are you afraid to be alone with me?
No.
So?
Could you be more specific?
Friday night?
Ok.
Ok.
Sir. Can I ask you what you're doing?
Looking for signs of urine, semen, or blood
not visible to the human eye.
Hey. There are more people here to see the bed.
Get them some water or something.
No. I'm not your assistant.
I can't leave all these strangers alone in our house.
That's your problem.
Look, I'll cut you in.
Like, ten percent of my ten percent.
Twenty-five dollars? Get real.
Twenty-five percent.
Half.
No way.
All right, have fun.
Hope nobody steals anything.
Fine, fine. Forty/sixty.
Deal.
Hello?
How many amps is this motor?
Hello.
Do you live here?
Uh, yeah.
How much do you want for the kitchen table?
Oh, hey. They're here to see the bed.
It'll just be a few more minutes.
Yeah, and the kitchen table's not for sale.
Well, how much are you willing to pay for it?
What?
You know that we haven't talked about baby names.
I was kinda thinking we could
name her after your dad.
Frank? That's a good way to scar her for the rest of her life.
Francesca,
and we could call her Frankie.
Seriously?
Yeah.
What do you think?
I think I love it.
So...
There's something I need to tell you.
What about?
Brandon.
I was just working on a new song.
Can you come sit please?
Yeah.
Mama told me what happened.
She did?
Uh, what did she tell you?
That you got high.
You did the right thing, calling one of us.
I'm assuming that you got the pot from one of your band mates?
I'm never going to do it again.
I probably should have warned you. We're not exactly pot people.
Of course nobody should be.
But, I freaked out when I tried it too.
Being in a band doesn't mean you have to act like a rock star.
That goes for alcohol, too.
OK.
I'm very happy that you're playing music again
but if being in this band affects your grades
or your judgment again, you're done.
Yeah. I get it.
I don't like having to be the hard ass, Brandon.
Don't.
Why do you have to be?
Because someone has to.
You'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.
I can't believe I just said that.
Dinner's in thirty minutes, OK?
You know, it also has a massage setting.
And memory foam so it contours to your body.
Well then, why are you selling it?
It's too big. It takes up the whole room.
Well, I don't believe my bedroom's any bigger than this.
Maybe it's too big for me too.
It's not too big, it's just, it's not good for... intimacy,
because of the split between the beds.
That's why we're selling it.
Oh... Well, that's no issue.
At my age, the less intimacy the better.
Then this is the bed for you, I think.
Oh, I hear a little squeaking sound.
Probably needs some maintenance.
I don't hear anything.
You know, it's illegal to sell a used bed.
Not privately.
And she would know, she's a cop.
Ah. The fuzz, eh?
Well, it's not worth it but I'll give you $500 bucks.
We're asking for twenty-five hundred.
And it sells for twice that new!
But it's not new, it's used and it squeaks.
It doesn't squeak.
Fifteen hundred.
Mom, we can get more for it.
Seven-fifty.
Twelve-fifty.
Please.
One thousand, my last offer.
Sold.
Hey, you just made a hundred dollars.
Sixty.
演唱者 Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors
It's been so long since you've all gotten in bed with us.
This is nice.
Which reminds me, we have to go shopping for a new mattress
tomorrow after your doctor's appointment...
Yes.
...see if we can get same day delivery.
Or, I guess, I'm sleeping on the floor tomorrow night?
'Fraid so.
Just make sure that old bag pays you in cash.
Hey, hey, hey. Language, please.
What time's your appointment tomorrow?
Nine A.M.
Will you let us know what she says?
I will text you immediately.
Where are you going to put the baby's crib?
We were thinking right here, by the window.
B, you're awfully quiet tonight.
He's not as quiet as Jude is.
I'm just kidding.
I do miss your sweet, sweet voice.
Now, shut up and roll.
Park Place. Pay me, sucka!
And there's a hotel. You are in big trouble, bud.
My turn.
All right.
What's going on?
I don't understand how this can happen overnight, literally.
Preeclampsia can go from mild to severe very quickly.
Well, there must be another medication.
There's protein in your urine and
Your blood pressure is dangerously high and rising.
At this point, all we can do
is deliver the baby and the placenta as soon as possible.
But the baby's only 20 weeks.
How many weeks does she have to be?
The earliest a premie can survive is 24 weeks
and even then there's only a 35% chance.
Then we wait... another six to eight weeks. Whatever it takes.
It's not just about the baby.
You could have a stroke, or impaired liver or kidney function.
It's maternal mortality that's the risk here.
OK. But this is all just worse case scenario stuff.
I could still respond to the blood pressure medication,
I can stay here in the hospital, I can stay on bed rest.
There's still a chance, right?
One I wouldn't recommend taking.
I'll leave you to talk.
I'm gonna be right back, OK?
Excuse me. What are we gonna do?
We can't make her deliver against her will.
Even if she could die?
Legally, we have to respect her wishes.
But she's isn't in crisis yet.
I know it's scary,
but let's give her a little time to process this.
OK?
Yeah. Thank you.
Come here.
演唱者 Ingrid Michaelson
I saw her, in a dream.
She was in our bed with us
and she was beautiful and she was healthy.
I can feel her inside me.
I have faith.
Even if it takes a miracle.
She's gonna be all right, she's going to make it.
I don't have faith.
That's OK. Because I have enough for the both of us.
So... mama's gonna be all right.
What about the baby?
Um... it doesn't look good.
So what can we do?
You can support mama.
And love her.
OK?
Grandma's here.
It's OK.
It's all right, baby.
It's OK.
Is Lena OK?
Grandma's still in with her.
I feel so sad.
Yeah, me too.
You should call Wyatt.
Why?
He's your boyfriend, right?
Right.
I met him yesterday.
You ran into Wyatt?
He asked to meet. To talk. About you.
Why? What did he say?
Just that things were good and then something happened.
Did he say what?
No.
He was just wondering...
...if it had to do with me.
We tried to have sex.
I freaked out. I had like... a panic attack.
At first, I did think...
maybe I wasn't over you.
But, then I realized...
Is it because of Liam?
Why don't you just tell Wyatt.
Because, I don't want to.
And I really wish he hadn't involved you.
Well, me too.
But...
I know how it feels to love you
and not know why you're pulling away.
It's a lonely place to be.
And frankly, it's not OK.
I really don't want to talk about this.
Of course you don't.
But you never want to talk about things that are hard.
But keeping stuff inside doesn't make it hurt less.
You just hurt the people you shut out.
We should get back inside.
I know that this sounds so selfish,
but everyone in the house is connected to somebody by blood.
I know that you don't need that to be a family, I know that.
But sometimes I'm afraid that...
...they won't love me as much as I love them
because I'm not their biological mom.
That they won't have that to tether them to me,
when I'm driving them crazy or I won't give them what they want.
Or I fail them.
That they'll just...
That they'll look at me and they'll say,
"You're not my real mom."
And walk away.
Honey, to be honest,
every mother's afraid that
our children won't love us the way we love them.
And they won't. Not in the same way.
Biology or not.
That's the way it's supposed to be.
Mothers and fathers, we have to love our children more...
...in order to make the sacrifices
it takes to put them first.
But one thing is true.
Love will always be a stronger bond than blood.
Trust that.
And those children out there love you.
They need you.
They can't lose you.
Their needs trump your wants.
And that's what being a real mother is all about.
Hey, Mom. I've been thinking...
I want you to keep the commission on the bed, OK?
I'm sorry.
I love you, baby.
I know you're angry we don't have the same birth father.
And that I have a half-sister and that I wanted to meet her.
And I know you're angry that we couldn't get adopted together.
And you don't feel like you have any say over anything.
But you do. When it comes to me, you do.
I won't ever see Sophia again if it hurts you.
And there is nothing you can ever say to me
that's gonna make me run away again.
But you have to talk to me.
And to the people who love you.
You can't shut us out.
It's selfish. And you're not selfish.
OK.
So, is Lena going to be OK?
Yeah, for now.
But she lost the baby so...
That's so sad.
I'm really sorry.
We all are.
I'm also sorry...
that I haven't told you why I couldn't...
I was raped.
Was it that guy, who...
Yeah. Yeah.
I thought I put it behind me.
But it turns out I...
still have some stuff I have to work through.
So I'm gonna need some space to do that.
OK.
Take as long as you need.
All I ever ask from you is this...
Is to talk to me.
演唱者 Us and Our Daughters
What's your name?
Layla.
That's a beautiful name. I like your unicorn.
She talks.
Oh, she does?
What does she say?
Lots of stuff.
Where's your mommy?
Are you sick?
No. Not really.
Then why are you in the hospital?
Layla! There you are. What are you doing?
I'm so sorry.
It's OK.
What did I tell you about wandering off?
Wait.
Layla.
She has to tell me something.
Are you sure?
OK.
Here. She says she wants to stay with you.
Won't you miss her?
It's OK.
Thank you.
Wait a second.
What's her name?
Frankie.
A cherry tree symbolizes birth, death and new awakening.
We've planted it for you, Frankie.
This tree, which blooms brilliantly but briefly each year,
will remind us that life is precious
and we need to live each day out loud,
and never forget how lucky we are to have this family
that you will always be part of,
where you live in our hearts, forever.
