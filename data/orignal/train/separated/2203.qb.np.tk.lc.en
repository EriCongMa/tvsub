this way , this way !
they &apos;re right behind us !
makoa ! makoa , come on , we have to go !
i can &apos;t !
makoa , come on !
‭ i think i broke it .
i can &apos;t move .
are you guys okay ?
it &apos;s my ankle .
aw , man .
hey , this is tua .
we got a first aid situation in sector four .
need assistance asap . over .
roger that .
i can probably walk on it .
come on , i &apos;ll help you up .
keep the weight off until we can get you checked out .
what the hell was that back there ?
wait , is that a foot ?
wow , you guys really go all @-@ out .
i mean , this is super realistic ,
with the flies and everything .
oh , god , it even smells gross .
we didn &apos;t put that there .
oh , my god !
we been walking for , like , a half a mile already .
more like a klick .
a klick ?
yeah , a kilometer . 6.2 of a mile .
oh , thank you , g.i. jerk , for the pedantic , uh ...
i know what a klick is .
point is we &apos;ve been walking in the middle of these
nowhere woods for i don &apos;t even know how long .
that &apos;s not a point . statement of the obvious .
oh , it &apos;s a statement . all right , well , how about @-@ how about
this statement of the obvious , okay ?
there is a direct correlation between how far you walk
to a crime scene and how bad that crime scene
is gonna be when you get there , okay ?
this is looking already like a two , three @-@ day case
just @-@ just from this ridiculous walk .
‭ so what ? what &apos;s the problem with that ?
tomorrow &apos;s halloween .
halloween , you know ?
it &apos;s the thing with the kids and they get the candy
and they &apos;re happy and they wear the costumes , trick or tre ...
y ... i love halloween .
i &apos;m very familiar with halloween .
you are ? because your halloween is the same thing every year .
you sit on a couch and you eat popcorn and you watch the same
stupid movie , okay ?
that &apos;s right , it &apos;s fantastic .
well , for me , it &apos;s different .
you see , time does not stand still .
when you have kids , it is only a matter of time
before they &apos;d rather eat a @-@ a tree
than spend halloween with you .
gracie made other plans ?
she , uh , is lost to me , as far as halloween is concerned .
but the little guy , he &apos;s very excited .
we have big plans , and now this .
you have plans with charlie ?
yeah .
oh , buddy .
well , listen , your son &apos;ll understand if you can &apos;t make it .
no , no . four @-@ year @-@ olds do not understand
why their father is not present .
they just know that he is not .
all right , look , this might not be that bad .
kono . call said we got body parts .
yeah . a lot of them .
found by a couple of kids on a horror campout .
a what ?
it &apos;s an interactive adventure .
people pay good money to spend the night outdoors
while a bunch of actors in masks
scare the hell out of them chasing them around .
i know a couple streets in camden
where you get the same experience , free of charge .
what did i say ?
yeah , well , as far as scares go ,
these guys got their money &apos;s worth .
dispatch said one suitcase . i see three .
yeah , hpd found these other two in the last half hour .
looks like we came across a dumping ground .
any idea how long they &apos;re been out here ?
uh , csu estimates about a week .
all right , everybody listen up .
i want k @-@ 9 out here . i want ground radar .
make sure we get everything . there could be more .
call max .
have him clear his schedule .
looks like we got a serial killer on our hands .
all right , max ,
you finish processing our three jane does ?
actually , gentlemen , there are four jane does .
wait a minute , i thought there was three bodies
in three suitcases .
upon closer investigation ,
each piece of luggage contained a scrambled jigsaw puzzle
of different body parts from four female victims .
and as you can see , each victim has key segments
of their anatomy missing .
but csu swept that area twice , so they got everything .
i &apos;m thinking the killer &apos;s holding on to them .
a souvenir .
i don &apos;t understood that . why would someone do that ?
i mean , i understand , like , a @-@ a trophy from a bowling league
or a hockey team or something like that ,
but a body part ?
curiously , i detected trace levels of formaldehyde and methanol--
chemicals commonly used for embalming .
however , none of the corpses have actually been embalmed .
all right , we need to start pulling employee records
for mortuaries , funeral homes ,
local cemeteries and start pulling a list of potential suspects .
what else you got for us , max ?
um , this , uh , the horizontal furrows on the victims &apos; neck
suggest death by strangulation .
do we have any idea when this happened ?
well , based on the level of putrification and presence of larvae ,
i &apos;d estimate the corpses to be about six to ten days old .
however , i did find freezer burn on the skin
of two of our victims
and ice crystals in the heart of a third .
that makes determining t.o.d. nearly impossible .
you &apos;re telling me he froze them
after he killed and dismembered them
and then he dumped &apos; em at a later date , is that right ?
that is my supposition .
so , basically , we have no idea .
we don &apos;t know . it could &apos;ve been a week , could &apos;ve been months .
meanwhile this whack job &apos;s still walking around .
well , it &apos;s a common misconception
that most serial killers are insane .
however , more often than not ,
they are consummate chameleons .
they &apos;re able to hide their rage and their true intentions
behind a more civilized facade ,
what we refer to as the mask of sanity .
he &apos;s likely hiding in plain sight , scouting the victims .
they kill their victims in one location
and dispose of them in another .
deacon mackenna , the trashman ...
max , i &apos;m so sorry , i didn &apos;t even ...
listen to me , th ...
if you want off this case , it &apos;s not a problem .
no , i @-@ i ... i thank you for that , commander .
your sensitivity towards the murder of my biological mother
is greatly appreciated .
however , i truly believe
that my expertise in serial killers and their modus operandi
will be a great asset to this investigation .
oh , we feel the same way , all right ?
stay close on this one . all right .
okay , these women were not randomly selected .
they were hand @-@ picked .
so we id these women .
we find out who they came in contact with ,
and that &apos;s how we find our killer , all right ?
thanks , max .
oh , a @-@ actually , uh , there is one more thing .
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m just perplexed
at the apparent lack of curiosity regarding my costume .
you &apos;re wearing a costume ?
ah , there it is .
a pithy retort laced with just a hint of condescension .
order is restored .
okay , who is it ?
oh , you want us to guess who it is .
uh , george washington &apos;s wife .
martha washington .
i &apos;m clearly one of keanu reeves&apos;
first film characters : chevalier raphael danceny .
i &apos;m , i ... i @-@ i &apos;m not a ...
well , i &apos;m not surprised , commander , that you are unaware
of stephen frears &apos; seminal art house film dangerous liaisons .
and i surmise the lack of car chases and explosions
did not pique your interest .
got you there .
excuse me ? got me there-- oh , you saw that movie ?
didn &apos;t see that movie .
when did you see that movie ?
1988 .
1988 ?
oh , gentlemen , uh ,
please take your tedious discourse elsewhere .
when was the movie made ? 19 ...
it was , probably wasn &apos;t even
made in ...
don &apos;t put your finger in .
you &apos;re gonna burn it .
adieu , adieu .
i remember , i definitely ...
i &apos;m here to donate blood .
i am prince vlad the third .
aka vlad the impaler ,
aka dracula .
anyway , i come here every year dressed like this to donate blood .
except for last year , when i got kidnapped
and helped take down a counterfeiter
that was trying to restart the ira .
fill this out .
i &apos;ll need to check your iron level and your blood pressure
to make sure you &apos;re safe to donate .
is that &apos; cause i &apos;m a heavy guy ?
no , because you &apos;re a vampire .
exam room three .
csu went through the luggage found at the crime scene .
two of the bags were generic . had no tags or markings .
lucky for us , though , one of our vics had really expensive taste .
this is porter luggage .
it &apos;s a top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line european brand .
each piece has its own unique serial number .
it was registered to ...
kimberly payne , a uk resident .
she &apos;s one of our vics .
well , interpol has a yellow notice on her .
she &apos;s been missing three months .
we know that she went through honolulu international customs .
she prepaid for her room at the kahala resort .
but according to their records , she never checked in .
okay , so our killer must have picked her up
somewhere between the airport and the hotel .
was she traveling with anybody ?
or meet anybody here ?
according to the missing persons report filed by her family ,
she was just on vacation alone .
all right , kono , do me a favor-- call the family .
tell them we found their daughter , please .
will do .
yeah , eric , what do you got ?
you like ?
that is very nice , e @-@ train .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a gift from beyond the grave .
uh , right .
sorry , i &apos;m still ...
developing my presentation style .
hpd found this on one of the bodies .
okay , so it belonged to one of the vics .
maybe .
or our killer put it there .
why would he do that ?
‭ because it &apos;s a black magic amulet .
part of some creepy serial killer ritual or whatever .
this inscription right here , it &apos;s a protection charm ,
most commonly used in occult ceremonies performed
to bind two people together .
not a very good protection charm , though ,
if you ask me , am i right ?
you know , &apos; cause she was chopped all up in a bag , right ?
guys , look , uh , all right , look , maybe it makes sense
if it &apos;s our killer &apos;s way of linking himself to the vic ?
okay , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s pretty good .
since when do you speak latin ?
i don &apos;t . i binged it , dude .
you know , where you type things in to the little bar and ...
yeah , i know what that is .
all right , well , i &apos;m not always sure ,
&apos;cause you were born before the internet and all that .
you want to sleep in the garage tonight ?
hey , however you want this to go down ,
uncle d ... hey .
... tective williams .
hey , this looks like there &apos;s a piece missing .
very good .
originally it looked like this .
what is that , blood ?
yup ... which i ran just before you arrived ,
and guess what ?
i don &apos;t want to guess .
right , uh , i got a hit .
all right , mark shepperd , 32 , got a record .
misdemeanor animal hoarding and cruelty .
possession , assault .
and interest in the occult by the looks of that ink .
and that creepy , dead expression in his eyes .
he &apos;s got the perfect serial killer resume .
i &apos;m losing sensation in my hand .
that &apos;s normal , right ?
i &apos;m sure you know what you &apos;re doing .
of course you do .
seriously , though , if blood doesn &apos;t get to my fingers ,
they could turn gangrenous , right ?
i &apos;ll just shut up and let you , uh ...
hey , jerry . great costume .
mind if i call you back ?
i &apos;m kind of in the middle of something .
yeah , you and me both .
i &apos;m at the hawaiian united blood bank on dillingham .
of course you are . i &apos;m sure they love the costume .
no , listen , there &apos;s something &apos;s going down .
you hear that ?
is that what i thought it was ?
yeah , it &apos;s bullets hitting wood and glass and metal .
hopefully not people , but i don &apos;t know .
some guys just stormed in here and took over the place .
okay , how many ?
more than one .
i can &apos;t see . i &apos;m in an exam room with a phlebotomist .
are you guys safe there ?
for now .
okay , hang tight .
we &apos;re on our way .
mark shepperd , five @-@ o !
you hear that ?
steve !
steve ? !
come on ! come on !
you know , you came close there , pal .
you should &apos;ve left me up there .
okay , first of all , you don &apos;t tell me what i should &apos;ve done .
secondly , you &apos;re not that lucky .
you &apos;re gonna pay for what you did to those women .
what are you talking about ?
you recognize that thing ?
yeah , it &apos;s my girlfriend &apos;s .
my ex @-@ girlfriend .
yeah , what &apos;s her name ?
tamara craig .
she , uh ... she one of these girls ?
that @-@ that &apos;s her . oh , my god , that &apos;s tamara .
what happened to her ?
well , that &apos;s what we &apos;re here to ask you .
you see , we found that amulet
with your blood in it at the crime scene .
well , you think that i did this ?
no , no , no , no , no , no . we exchanged amulets ,
yes , but it was her idea ,
you know , like angie and billy bob .
it was our way of always being with each other .
where &apos;s yours ?
in my trash at home .
i threw it away right before , uh ...
before , um , what ?
right before i tried to kill myself .
tamara was my whole reason for living .
i could never hurt her .
when she broke up with me ,
i lost everything .
when was the last time you saw her ?
five weeks ago , we had a blow @-@ out .
she went to hong kong to visit one of her friends .
um , i thought that she would just cool off and come back ,
like she always did .
but she didn &apos;t .
she didn &apos;t answer my calls .
she didn &apos;t answer my texts .
i finally realized that it was just over .
that i was never gonna see her again .
where are you going ?
you &apos;re just gonna leave me here ? !
okay , he &apos;s not our guy .
no , i @-@ i agree .
he &apos;s got that , uh , emo sensitive ... i mean , he &apos;s ...
i &apos;m @-@ gonna @-@ write a @-@ really @-@ terrible @-@ love @-@ song
about @-@ the @-@ girl kind of vibe ,
but multiple homicides-- i don &apos;t think so .
call hpd , have them come get him ,
take him to king &apos;s medical .
i want a full mh @-@ 1 psych eval on the guy , okay ?
all right .
that &apos;s gonna give us time to verify his story .
in the meantime , let &apos;s pull
what we can find on tamara craig .
see if there &apos;s any connection
to the other vic , kimberly payne .
i got to take this .
okay .
rachel , slow down .
slow @-@ slow down .
where is she now ?
okay , don &apos;t ... i will take care ...
i &apos;m gonna go find her , i &apos;m gonna pick her up ,
and i &apos;ll take her back to the house , okay ?
please , everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
i will call you the second i have her .
i got it . okay ?
trust me . okay , bye .
is grace all right ? what &apos;s going on ?
grace , uh , was supposed to be
at a sleepover at her friend &apos;s place in kahala .
turns out she lied , and she is at a house party
up on the north shore .
go . i got this .
are you sure ?
am i sure ? your 13 @-@ year @-@ old daughter
is at a party on the other side of the island , danny .
good point . now i &apos;m gonna kill myself .
don &apos;t kill yourself , danny . she &apos;ll be fine .
hey , duke .
kono , chin , shooters fled the scene .
we have apbs out .
nothing but minor injuries inside .
thanks , duke .
hey , jerry , you okay ?
uh , blood pressure &apos;s a little high . otherwise , i &apos;m good .
manager got a little roughed up ,
but i think everyone else is just a little freaked out .
oh , this is lia , the phlebotomist i told you about .
lia , these are my partners .
any idea what they took ?
blood .
blood ?
lots of it .
what kind of thieves take blood ?
vampires .
someone was in a hurry .
looks like they took most of
our packed cells of jk3 @-@ negative .
oh , that &apos;s really rare .
impressive . he &apos;s right .
jk3 @-@ neg is only found in one in 10,000 people in hawaii ,
mainly polynesians and asians .
so , blood that rare could be a black market play .
only its value comes with an expiration date .
unless it &apos;s refrigerated correctly ,
it has to be hung within 30 minutes of leaving here .
and the transfusion has to be performed by someone
who knows what they &apos;re doing .
if i want blood , i &apos;m going to an er ,
unless , of course , doing that is gonna get me arrested
because i &apos;m a criminal .
so , someone &apos;s in desperate need of blood ,
and this was stolen to order .
so , i dug into tamara craig &apos;s background .
now , there &apos;s nothing directly connecting her
to our other vic , kimberly payne ,
but then , i ran tamara &apos;s phone records .
turns out the last call she made from her cell phone
was right after she arrived at honolulu international
from osaka three weeks ago .
she was calling her dentist to confirm
a dental appointment she had that afternoon .
let me guess . she didn &apos;t show .
that &apos;s right .
just like kimberly payne .
soon as she arrives at honolulu international ,
not long after that , poof , she disappears .
all right , so we &apos;re looking for somebody
with a connection to the airport .
this is where he &apos;s picking his victims .
yeah , but come on .
there &apos;s 15,000 people working at that airport ,
not to mention all the pedestrian traffic .
any one of those people could be our suspect .
that &apos;s great . i embarrassed you .
i &apos;m very sorry .
i apologize very deeply for embarrassing you , grace .
but i have been pulled off a very important case .
what about that ? what about the fact that i am in my car ,
i &apos;m driving 35 miles in the middle of nowhere looking for you ?
how about that ? how about the fact that you lied to your mother ?
who is , in fact , a liar herself .
she lied to me about charlie , but that is not ...
not this conversation .
that is ... that is me talking to myself .
okay , that &apos;s a completely different conversation .
back to you .
you , young lady , will respect my wishes .
you will respect my wishes till the day you turn 18 .
okay , and that &apos;s the law ,
and i know law because i &apos;m a police officer , okay ?
truth be told , in reality ,
you should respect my wishes till the end of time .
but now , because of your selfish ... behavior ,
i am not gonna get to see your little brother tonight ,
which upsets me .
what kind of lolo steals blood ?
well , apparently , vampires .
actually , come to think of it ,
vampires feast on the blood of the living .
they don &apos;t do takeout .
hey , vampires are not real , period .
they &apos;re just an inspired
marketing device to sell popcorn .
i would kill for a gimmick like that , bruddah .
there &apos;s no gimmick .
vampirism existed since the beginning of time .
ancient cultures , including the mesopotamians ,
the hebrews , the ancient greeks , and romans
all had tales of demons and spirits
which are considered precursors to the modern vampire .
whoa , van helsing , is this gonna be long ?
&apos;cause if it is , i think you three should order something ,
&quot; cause these tables are not free .
all right , take a look .
so i pulled up
all the incident reports of hpd radio calls
in the last 24 hours .
anything that could have been an act of violence
requiring immediate medical attention .
i got a 911 call about shots being fired
within 15 minutes of the blood bank being hit .
looks like they found bullet casings
and a whole lot of blood at the scene .
it was within a couple of miles of the blood bank .
‭ so , they should be in the area .
well , hpd already canvassed all the hospitals ,
doctors &apos; offices and clinics .
all right , well , let &apos;s think outside the box then .
are there any places in the area
that could provide any kind of medical attention ?
the kalihi pet clinic .
makes sense .
vampires are technically bats , right ?
jerry , stay here .
you sure ?
we &apos;re sure .
so what you gonna order ? you ?
good evening.five @-@ o.
sorry to bother you , ma &apos;am ,
but we &apos;re doing a routine sweep of the area ,
looking for any signs of suspicious activity .
why ? is something going on ?
it &apos;s halloween .
we &apos;re just checking out the neighborhood .
you know how kids are .
yes , i @-@ i understand .
uh , n @-@ no . nothing , officers .
it &apos;s been a really slow night .
okay . well , if you do happen to see
or hear anything unusual , please give us a call .
i will .
all right , we &apos;ll be on our way .
have a good night .
you , too .
call for backup .
tell them we got a hostage situation .
i got tsa to send me over
some security footage .
we got hits on both the victims ,
and after tracking them through the airport ,
i came up with a short list of suspects--
people they both came in contact with .
check this guy out .
this guy &apos;s is charles oakman ,
and for a guy who &apos;s making tips
loading people &apos;s bags , he &apos;s pretty overqualified .
the guy &apos;s got two degrees--
one of them &apos;s in mortuary science .
max found traces of embalming chemicals on the vics .
well , employee records show ...
this guy used to be an embalming tech
for east memorial funeral home .
wouldn &apos;t be the first guy to take his work home with him .
hiding in plain sight .
son of a bitch . we got an address on this guy ?
charles oakman ? five @-@ o !
clear !
clear in here .
whew ! it &apos;s filthy .
good grief !
must &apos;ve killed the maid , too .
nobody gets cop humor here .
hey , lou .
what are those , luggage tags ?
&quot; tamara craig . &quot;
&quot; kimberly payne &quot;
&quot; monica segert . &quot;
&quot; amanda lombard . &quot;
call max-- tell him
we just i.d. &apos; d the last two vics .
the aggregation of dust particles
and general preservation of space
suggests our killer is somehow stuck in time .
yeah , it &apos;s like he &apos;s dedicated this room
as a memorial of some kind .
perhaps for a woman who once lived here with him .
she looks like one of our victims .
yeah , she does .
maybe he &apos;s targeting women that remind him of her .
two of the victims had very different facial features ,
skin and hair coloration .
but he only needed one of them .
okay , so what are you saying , max ?
it might not just be the face he &apos;s after .
it &apos;s the whole body .
that would explain why all the missing body parts put together
formed an entirely new female form .
i think he &apos;s trying to recreate a love he lost .
we &apos;re chasing dr. frankenstein .
jump ! jump ! jump ! jump !
all right , just , uh ...
relax and breathe .
there &apos;s no need to , um ...
assume the worst .
she &apos;s a good kid , and she ... makes good choices .
let &apos;s roll .
oh , excuse me , sir . excuse me .
hey , i &apos;m sorry to bother you guys .
have you seen this girl ?
no ? no ?
excuse me .
have you seen this girl ?
no . sorry .
no ?
how about you ?
how about you guys , have you seen this girl ?
what about you , mod squad ?
hey , your costume &apos;s really cute .
thanks . i made it myself .
nice .
so how do you know dave ?
i don &apos;t .
i just came with some friends .
well , i &apos;m glad you did .
what are you ... doing here ?
what am i doing here ?
i don &apos;t know , i just thought i &apos;d , uh , check out the party .
what &apos;s going on , dude ?
don &apos;t , uh ... &quot; dude &quot; me , okay ?
first of all . and second of all ,
please step away from my daughter ,
or i &apos;m gonna take that plastic sword
and turn you into a roman popsicle , okay ?
that &apos;s a good choice , maximus .
danno , you &apos;re embarrassing me .
l @-@ let ... go . right now .
i &apos;m not gonna ask you again .
let &apos;s go right now , okay ?
let &apos;s go .
okay , so the clinic manager confirmed
there are two people on the premises--
a receptionist and a vet .
okay , well , i &apos;m registering seven thermals ,
five of them hostile , and one of whom is injured enough
to require a lot of blood .
okay . so we have to assume that the receptionist
and the vet are treating the injury .
that means there &apos;s no way we can go in hot
without them being taken as collateral .
cops are here .
work faster .
hey , i told you , i &apos;m going as fast as i can .
they get in here , you die first .
please ... i @-@ i told you , i only work on animals .
i don &apos;t even have the right equipment .
all you have to do ...
is keep me alive .
i think we &apos;ve been made .
all right , tony , here we go .
ep @-@ 1 will be the front door .
you and your team will cover that .
kono and i &apos;ll come around to
the back of the building to ep @-@ 2 right there .
eric . thanks for coming down .
you kidding me ?
this is a real serial killer &apos;s house .
if you offered me this or a weekend
at the hawaii loa presidential villa
with all the south american miss universe finalists ,
i &apos;m picking this , hands down .
really ?
this is my jam .
i would have to concur .
does anybody have any information ?
yes .
thank you .
the luggage tags checked out .
amanda lombard was a nevada resident .
she was on the california department of justice missing persons list .
monica segert was a german national .
she went missing over a year ago .
she was flying as a student
on an around @-@ the @-@ world airline ticket .
both the i.d. &apos; s were a direct match to both our vics .
all right . what about the woman
in the photograph we found inside .
the picture you found was a bit faded
and makes it difficult to run facial recognition--
unless you &apos;re a forensic phenom .
i did a digital reconstruct on her face ,
and ... got a hit on a driver &apos;s license .
nice . &quot; maggie king . &quot;
her employee records show she worked
at the east memorial funeral home .
that &apos;s the same place that our suspect ,
charles oakman , worked .
i &apos;m thinking workplace romance ,
which came to an abrupt end three years ago
when she was killed in plane crash in uruguay .
her unexpected death was probably the trauma
that triggered mr. oakman &apos;s murderous proclivities .
that &apos;s it-- that &apos;s where she left him at the airport .
she never came back again .
and now that &apos;s where he sees her ,
over and over again , in these other women .
look at this .
maggie had a cottage registered in her name .
now , it &apos;s in a really remote location--
it &apos;s out by kipapa gulch .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s got to be the place
he &apos;s processing those bodies .
you know , grace , um ...
i know that you think you are mature enough to
make your own decisions ,
but you are not , okay ?
someday you will .
someday you will be able to make your own decisions ,
god help my anxiety levels .
and who knows , maybe someday you will have children of your own ,
and you will know what your mother and i go through .
i &apos;m your father ,
and it is my job ... to protect you
from the bad things that could potentially happen .
and there are a lot of things that could happen that
keeps me laying awake at night , you understand ?
i &apos;m not trying to ruin your fun , grace .
i want you to have a good time .
that &apos;s not what this is about , okay ?
i &apos;m trying to protect you-- protect you
from potential disaster ...
danno !

wonderful .

nope .

the power &apos;s out .
find me a fuse box , lou .
‭ on it .
lou , how we looking with that fuse box ?

charles oakman . five @-@ o.
come out with your hands where i can see them .
lou , talk to me .
come on , lou .
yeah . i found it .
steve ? steve ?
mcgarrett ? !
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be fine .
man , what the hell
happened down there ?
i found dr. frankenstein .
and his bride .
cover !
any closer , she dies .
you wait any longer , you die .
right through the heart .
only way to stop a vampire .
what are you doing ? working late ?
um , i @-@ i was just about to leave .
max , i just wanted to come by
and say thank you for your help with this case .
the truth is , if it wasn &apos;t for your expertise ,
i don &apos;t think we would &apos;ve caught this guy
as soon as we did .
it is highly probable that , without intervention ,
mr. oakman would have begun his work on the next bride .
for serial killers ,
every murder results in a further refinement
of their fantasy ,
a quest for perfection .
yes , ted bundy refers to it as the learning curve .
okay . um ...
anyway , good work .
just doing my job , commander .
all right .
max , uh ...
it &apos;s none of my business ,
so forgive me ,
but that file that you &apos;re reading ,
you &apos;re not gonna find your mother in there .
she &apos;s in here .
thank you very much for the flyer .
we &apos;ll definitely come check out your band .
right on .
mahalo , brutha .
yeah , thank you .
online we &apos;ll check it out , right ?
his band music really sucked .
yes , it did . yes , it did .
but i need him to take my car to the garage ,
not to a chop shop , so ...
so you told a lie .
yeah . i guess , uh ...
i guess what i said was technically a ...
a variety of white lie .
the harmless kind , the good kind ,
the kind designed to not hurt the guy &apos;s feelings .
which is very different to the lie you told your mother and me .
i &apos;m sorry , danno .
i know .
just make sure you tell your mother you &apos;re sorry , too , okay ?
i will .
i love you , danno .
i love you , too . come here .
mom , before you say anything , i &apos;m sorry .
right , left , right . let &apos;s go , champ .
