best show ever , dante ! great show !
nice job ! beautiful .
just let me--
hey , uh , look , you &apos;re not allowed to be over there , all right ?
stay there .
here he comes .
i know . i know . i know .
he looked right at me . did you see that ?
i saw it . i saw him look right at you .
we had a connection .
oh , he &apos;s awesome .
when he sang &apos; resurrection &apos; , it was like
everyone in the theater just disappeared .
he is so beautiful.- totally , man .
so beautiful .
this is us .
both of you ?
yeah .
we live on the same block , dummy .
i could , uh , walk you to your building .
what ?
i mean , it &apos;s--it &apos;s dark .
so ?
we gotta go .
i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s dark . i could walk you--
i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m tougher than you are , ted .
thank you for taking us to the concert , though , ted .
bye !
bye @-@ bye .
it &apos;s ed , not ted .
the latest victim is tara farris , 20 .
she &apos;s the third victim in 2 weeks .
all found on freeway off @-@ ramps by commuters .
well , he &apos;s not hiding them .
an l.a. freeway during morning rush hour ?
he wants them found .
quickly .
well , they &apos;re still dressed .
that minimizes the shock value .
maybe he &apos;s concerned for them .
thank you , he wants them taken care of ?
no signs of sexual assault on any of the victims .
look how pale she is .
all of them were severely hypovolemic .
tara had less than a pint of blood in her .
look at this . the first 2 had more than 3 pints each .
if exsanguination is the goal ,
the unsub is definitely becoming more proficient .
this is new . tara &apos;s the only victim to have a written message .
&apos;the liar.&apos;
&apos;the &apos; liar .
that &apos;s strange , isn &apos;t it ?
not a liar or just liar .
so what did you lie about , tara ?
all of the victims appear to have been strangled
and then bled out through identical wounds in the throat .
wait--seriously , are those supposed to be fang marks ?
all of the wounds on the victims were covered in saliva .
human saliva , as though--
someone drank their blood .
in all the darkest pages of the malign supernatural ,
there is no more terrible tradition than that of the vampire .
a pariah even among demons .
writer montague summers .
ok . ok , thanks .
so they &apos;ve already set up a task force in los angeles .
this isn &apos;t their first serial case .
you remember detective owen kim ?
from the stalker case .
you remember that case , don &apos;t you , spence ?
i do remember that case .
yeah , you ever talk to , um , lila anymore ?
you know , i think we should probably focus on this case right now .
it &apos;s a little more pertinent .
all right , so tell us about blood @-@ drinkers , reid .
human blood consumption , or clinical vampirism ,
is known as renfield &apos;s syndrome ,
named after the insect @-@ eating character
in bram stoker &apos;s novel &quot; dracula . &quot;
are they sadists ?
not necessarily . pain to the victim is usually only a byproduct .
blood is the focus .
renfield &apos;s syndrome is usually accompanied by
varying levels of schizophrenia
and occasionally more classic cannibalism
if the condition evolves .
classic cannibalism .
lovely job we have .
i will say this--
true cases are exceedingly rare .
that &apos;s comforting . sort of .
renfield &apos;s may be rare ,
but vampires are anything but .
and there &apos;s a huge subculture in los angeles
of the red @-@ drinking undead .
why is that not a surprise ?
garcia , all these people drink blood ?
au contraire . they mostly just dress
up like prentiss did in high school
and they make believe . it &apos;s all kinds of delicious .
it &apos;s not the same thing at all . as a matter of fact ,
we should refer to this unsub as a vampirist ,
not a vampire .
and they would be attracted to the subculture
merely for its professed worship of blood .
ok , i &apos;m going to continue spelunking
through the various online sites ,
see if anything jumps up and bites me .
thanks , baby g--
thanks , penelope . stay close .
yes , sir .
garcia out .
you guys , one more thing-- vampirists are coveters .
they most generally always have some sort of relationship
with the victim , even if it &apos;s tangential .
and they &apos;re likely to become obsessed .
they &apos;ve almost certainly crossed paths in some way .
los angeles , california
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s just me . it &apos;s ray .
you still in bed ?
i &apos;m sick .
look , dante , you &apos;re already late .
don &apos;t call me that .
sorry , but , man , you gotta get going , ok ?
i said no .
the record company is gonna be pissed again .
if you &apos;re not ...
get out !
i know you hate these parties ,
but you &apos;ve got to sell the record .
you can &apos;t blow this off .
it &apos;s your job , man .
and it &apos;s my job to make you go .
do i have to be him ?
you know that you do .
i &apos;ll be down in 20 minutes .
great . i &apos;ll make you something to eat .
i &apos;m not hungry .
what happened to you last night ?
what do you mean ?
after the show . you just kind of disappeared .
i don &apos;t remember .
hi , lieutenant kim . agent jareau .
jj , of course . i remember most of you .
agent hotchner .
reid .
morgan .
welcome back to the left coast .
these are agents prentiss and rossi .
i believe they &apos;re new to you .
hi . pleasure .
we already have a room set up full of glass boards , case files ,
and extremely bad coffee .
we &apos;ve worked with a lot less .
agent morgan &apos;s in charge now . it &apos;s his show .
long story .
i know you like to start with the freshest information
and work your way back .
so tara &apos;s apartment has been processed and sealed
in case you want to go there .
and her body , along with that of the first 2 girls ,
is at the morgue with an m.e. waiting there for your call .
all right . jj , get set up here ,
and then hook up with garcia .
send her the witness information
so she can start cross @-@ referencing with the first 2 victims .
reid , i want you to go through all the case files ,
set up a preliminary profile based on
what you already know about the psychopathology .
and the rest of us , let &apos;s find out what we can on tara .
so we &apos;re looking for a connection between the witnesses .
when vampirists become obsessed ,
they aren &apos;t likely to find a random victim .
if we can find a cross @-@ relationship , someone in all the victims &apos; lives ,
that &apos;ll be incredibly helpful .
gina king knew tara the longest .
they apparently had some classes together .
let &apos;s get all the information we can on that relationship .
as a matter of fact , get me everything you can on all of tara &apos;s friends .
all right . in the morning i &apos;ll track them down and do some follow @-@ up .
that &apos;s fine .
dante .
this is jeff from &quot; metal life &quot; magazine .
he &apos;s writing a story on artists who cross over ...
cross over . is that what i do , jeff from &quot; metal life &quot; ?
i guess , kind of . you &apos;re not totally goth , right ?
that whole vampire thing you do is ...
ah , the vampire thing ?
yeah , your act . it appeals to certain people .
it appeals to desperate , sad people
with , at best , a tenuous hold on reality .
wow . can i quote you on that ?
sure . knock yourself out .
no , don &apos;t use that quote .
&apos;cause i can just get him back , get another ...
you know what , don &apos;t even bother ,
man . he was old news 5 years ago .
where &apos;s the scotch ?
over here . listen , here &apos;s the thing ,
he &apos;s not on his game lately .
this is almost exactly like my first apartment in georgetown .
my mom wanted me to stay on campus ,
but i was determined to make it , so ...
i waitressed on the weekends to swing it .
you must have been a hell of a waitress
to swing an apartment in georgetown .
no , i sucked .
i only got by &apos; cause my mom put money in my account every week
and we both pretended i didn &apos;t know .
looks like she was studying to make movies .
rossi .
who is this guy ?
well , if you want to look into a young girl &apos;s life today ,
you have to access her myspace ,
facebook , and twitter accounts .
i &apos;ll call the sexiest hacker on the planet .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s going to print that quote .
who cares ?
you shouldn &apos;t say stuff like that about your fans .
maybe i &apos;ll just jump off .
i mean , i &apos;m a vampire .
maybe i could just fly away .
i don &apos;t like that kind of talk .
what &apos;s wrong , ray ,
afraid you &apos;re gonna lose your cash cow ?
what &apos;s happened to you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
come on . we used to have fun , remember ?
i don &apos;t make music anymore .
i make events .
i play a character .
you sell records .
it &apos;s not as if i exactly light up
the sales charts anymore , anyway .
you &apos;ll sell again .
ray , you may be the only friend i have left ,
but ... you &apos;re a pretty crappy liar .
ohh ! i &apos;m so sorry !
it &apos;s my fault . it &apos;s my fault .
let me help you .
wow . interesting hand .
do you know who i am ?
yeah . i mean , you &apos;re the music guy .
this is your party , right ?
yes . this is ... this is for me , but ...
i have a pocket full of what will make us both
feel so much happier .
you do ?
so let &apos;s get out of here .
really ?
yeah . come on , let &apos;s go . you won &apos;t be sorry .
the saliva hasn &apos;t been dna i.d. &apos; d ,
but we have it going through the lab .
you can have the samples sent over to the local bureau lab
and have them rush it .
you should have something by sometime tomorrow .
i &apos;ll have it sent right over .
they &apos;re not bites .
look at the edges . they &apos;re razor sharp .
a tooth would leave a ragged , torn edge .
i have some photos of animal bites on the table
for comparison .
some sort of boring instrument , then ?
very sharp and very efficient .
well , if it isn &apos;t a bite , then the saliva ,
is it from licking , afterwards ?
maybe . i haven &apos;t seen anything like it .
once an unsub like this gets started ...
it only gets worse .
this is chase manning , news chopper 12,
over the 101 freeway in the san fernando valley .
apparently a second body in as many days
has been found near an off @-@ ramp .
so much for keeping the media out .
penelope ?
are we in yet ?
all yours .
i always feel skeevy going through
someone &apos;s life like this .
ok , so everything looks like it &apos;s password protected ,
so you might not even be able to ...
you &apos;re in already , aren &apos;t you ?
the password was cullen .
of course .
colon ?
cullen .
the vampire family from &quot; twilight . &quot;
what &apos;s &quot; twilight &quot; ?
do you ever read anything other than technical books ?
not much in english .
ok , i &apos;ll see what i can dredge .
my love is strong .
ok , thanks .
how &apos;s the profile coming ?
i don &apos;t know . i never really feel ready , you know ?
it &apos;ll be fine .
i am gonna go talk to tara &apos;s bff
before the media requests come in and it gets too crazy .
what &apos;s a bff ?
best friend forever .
should i go with you ?
no . you have a profile to deliver .
i should really work on it a little more .
reid .
what are you doing with my phone ?
derek , hey , um ,
spence is ready for the profile .
why , yes , he is , right here .
i &apos;ll be back .
hey .
all right , reid . we &apos;ll be right in .
hotch , reid &apos;s ready with the profile .
good .
highway crew found her just as the sun was coming up .
how long &apos;s she been here ?
barely even cold yet .
an hour , maybe ?
the liar .
the same message .
apparently it wasn &apos;t tara @-@ specific .
i wonder what it means , then .
the first victim on a consecutive day .
detective kim , can you have your crime scene techs
keep us apprised of the processing ?
we &apos;re ready with a preliminary profile .
that &apos;s quick .
so &apos;s this unsub .
we aren &apos;t looking for a vampire
in the supernatural sense , only in the sense
that this unsub has a very strong desire , a need , for human blood .
now , fortunately ,
vampirists display several characteristics
which will be helpful in finding him .
he will have cut himself repeatedly .
it &apos;s called auto @-@ vampirism ,
essentially becoming his own first victim .
it &apos;s the way by which he first tasted human blood .
most vampirists are incredibly ashamed of this
and will wear long @-@ sleeved shirts in order to conceal it .
secondly , there will be a long history of animal abuse ,
starting with smaller animals such as insects and rodents
and then working his way up to larger things--
dogs and cats .
though this is a well @-@ recognized component
of the homicidal triad seen in other serial killers ,
in the case of the vampirist , it &apos;s more pronounced .
there will , interestingly enough ,
not be any animal torture ,
as with other psychopathologies .
the killing isn &apos;t the point , it &apos;s merely
a means by which to obtain the blood .
look hard at your animal control sections records ,
as far back as you can .
they will probably have some record
of this unsub as an adolescent .
this guy also most likely lives
in a poorly kept older home .
he needs a house for the privacy , not an apartment .
it takes some time to drain a body completely of blood .
uninterrupted time .
this unsub also most likely lives with an elderly woman ,
a grandmother , a mother ,
even an aunt .
how could you know that ?
this type of mental illness ,
accompanied by extreme schizophrenia ,
dominates a family &apos;s entire existence .
it often leads to a broken home ,
and a woman ends up as primary caregiver .
the men generally leave .
oh , and one more thing .
this type of disorder cannot be hidden for long .
i guarantee you someone out there
already knows this unsub is very , very sick .
you ok ? you all right ?
should i--should i call somebody ?
tell me what &apos;s happening . talk to me .
talk to me .
oh , my god .
i can &apos;t stop it .
i want to .
but i can &apos;t stop it .
you gotta help me .
i know . i will .
you gotta help me .
i will .
are you all right ?
talk to me .
i can &apos;t stop it .
come here .
we &apos;re gonna fix this , ok ?
i &apos;m gonna fix this .
agent morgan , we &apos;ve identified this morning &apos;s victim .
erin hickman .
she worked for a caterer at an event last night .
they &apos;re still there cleaning up .
where can i find ms. masters ?
she &apos;s right there .
thank you .
excuse me . ms. masters ?
i &apos;m lieutenant kim , lapd .
is this about erin ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
is she really dead ?
yes , ma &apos;am . i &apos;m sorry .
these are fbi agents morgan and prentiss .
fbi ?
erin hickman work for you ?
well , till last night . she walked out on me
in the middle of the party .
walked out ?
all i know
is she was here one minute and gone the next .
was it uncommon for her to be irresponsible ?
look , i don &apos;t want to speak ill of the--
she had a problem with drugs .
excuse me .
morgan .
we saw a poster of him in tara &apos;s house .
speak to me , vision .
garcia , give me everything you &apos;ve got
on a singer named dante .
dante , the vampire guy ? i was just about to call you .
you know him ?
uh , he &apos;s the one thing that all
of our victims have in common .
what do you mean ?
they have cyber shrines set up for this guy .
they worship him . they &apos;re obsessed with his music .
well , his new album comes out today
and it &apos;s called &quot; the liar . &quot;
&quot; the liar , &quot; i know .
and isn &apos;t that what was written on them ?
ok , uh , all of our victims ,
including the first two , were diehard fans .
tara and gina-- that &apos;s tara &apos;s friend--
they were practically running his fan club .
what about erin hickman , our latest victim ?
erin hickman--i haven &apos;t run across that name .
ok , we need to talk to this dante guy .
garcia , can you get us an address ?
that &apos;s gonna take a little while .
these celebrities are protected by layers of privacy .
it &apos;s like finding information on a deeply--
22423 greenvale circle ,
holmby hills . gps coordinates are uploading to you now .
and his name is paul davies , by the way .
run him for a criminal record , too .
you got it .
thanks , p.g.
i &apos;d hate to think what she could find out about me .
oh , i prefer not even to consider it .
it doesn &apos;t look like a lot of poorly maintained
single @-@ family homes .
no .
i hate to ask this ,
but are your profiles this far off sometimes ?
they haven &apos;t been yet .
this probably isn &apos;t our unsub ,
just a piece of the puzzle .
i could get used to this .
this is definitely not poorly maintained .
one of these things does not belong .
hey , garcia , can you run a plate for me ?
this isn &apos;t our guy , is it ?
i highly doubt it .
may i help you guys ?
dante ?
no .
you &apos;re not the singer ?
dante &apos;s not my name . he &apos;s a character i play .
so who are you guys ?
we &apos;re investigating a murder--
sir ! would you mind coming in to answer a few questions ?
prentiss , what are you doing ?
that car is erin hickman &apos;s car .
the victim &apos;s car .
would you mind coming in , sir ?
this is elizabeth chambers
outside the los angeles police department
with a story we &apos;re still developing .
the singer @-@ songwriter known as dante
has been taken into custody by the fbi
as a suspect in a recent string of murders
in the los angeles area .
dante ! dante !
what &apos;s it been , 30 minutes ?
what about your music ?
welcome to the media capital of the world .
oh , god .
how the hell did they get here so fast ?
who knows ? they always do .
now listen up . we &apos;re gonna have to push through .
can you at least put a jacket over me or something ?
do you have anything you want to say ? !
if we &apos;re gonna go we gotta go now .
back off !
everyone back off !
back off !
back up , please ! back up !
back up !
i &apos;m with the fbi !
i have an official statement
if you &apos;ll just come over here , please .
is he gonna be ok ?
he &apos;s got a gun . keep moving .
right in here . thank you very much .
ok , this is just a preliminary investigation right now .
a lot of this doesn &apos;t add up .
we &apos;ve been wrong before .
not this much .
the plot thickens .
he was arrested for domestic violence 10 years ago .
how bad .
well , garcia was able to find the battery charge ,
but it was expunged , so who knows ?
again , welcome to celebrity justice .
he &apos;s pretty agitated .
i wonder why .
celebrities out here aren &apos;t used to being put in the box .
this seems more than that , though .
i don &apos;t know . these are people
everyone falls down around , defers to .
adulation is their norm .
you know , prentiss , that may be
a good way for you to play him .
me ?
you were the one who pointed at him .
he may see you as an adversary . have him off @-@ guard .
so , what did you tell the press ?
my official statement was that i hate los angeles .
what &apos;s happening ?
prentiss is gonna take the lead .
good choice .
remember , if he is the unsub ,
he &apos;s ashamed of the disorder ,
so use that to your advantage .
tell him you can &apos;t believe
that someone like him could do this .
throw him a lifeline .
right .
ask him for his autograph .
oh . right . right .
adulation .
mr. davies . have a seat , relax .
relax ?
how the hell am i supposed to relax ?
please sit .
i &apos;ve been trying to call my manager ,
but i can &apos;t get a signal .
these interrogation rooms don &apos;t usually have cell service .
is there another phone that i can use ?
i--i think there &apos;s been a really big mistake .
there &apos;s been no mistake .
i &apos;m sure that you couldn &apos;t have had
anything to do with what &apos;s happened .
really ? i mean , you &apos;re the one that brought me in here .
the police gave me some bad information .
you &apos;re not the police ?
good , she &apos;s confusing him .
schizophrenics can &apos;t follow that .
neither one of us is the type of person
who belongs in a police interrogation room .
supervisory special agent emily prentiss ,
federal bureau of investigation .
fbi ?
and , of course , i know who you are .
i &apos;m a big fan .
really ?
does that surprise you ?
yeah . yeah , that &apos;s a surprise .
ok . well , before we get started ...
would you mind ?
would i mind what ?
well , i hate to ask ,
but i don &apos;t usually get opportunities like this .
what the hell is this ? you &apos;re no fan of mine .
you people think i &apos;m stupid .
that kind of contradiction should
completely confuse a schizophrenic .
they can &apos;t make sense of it .
am i suspected of something ?
what &apos;s the name of your new album ,
the one that comes out today ?
is she--
dead ? yes .
with the name of your new album written on her .
it &apos;s a common phrase .
is it ? it seems a little odd to me .
the instead of a .
and this girl went home with you last night .
she &apos;s dead ?
can you explain that ?
i--i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t remember .
you don &apos;t remember hurting her ?
no . no .
their blood was drained .
from holes in their throats .
what ?
are you a vampire , mr . davies ?
you can &apos;t be serious .
it &apos;s a character i play , a stage act .
you know , sometimes things get out of hand .
no , no .
this is--this is crazy .
i don &apos;t know how that girl ended up like that .
i think i need my manager here .
you &apos;re gonna do this all on your own ,
just like a big boy .
but i have the right to a lawyer .
are you asking for an attorney ?
no . i &apos;m asking to speak to my manager
so he can find one .
i need a phone .
i need to make a call .
i need to make a call .
there &apos;s nothing you can do when they lawyer up , prentiss .
dr. reid here .
spence , what &apos;s going on ?
the possible suspect &apos;s some sort of rock and roll star .
seriously ?
yeah . a lot of it doesn &apos;t fit the profile , though .
anything i can do ?
there &apos;s a lot of media attention .
all right . well , i &apos;m already here at gina &apos;s house ,
so let me get some info and i &apos;ll be back .
great . thank you so much .
none of this makes any sense .
no .
television is saying his new record
is selling through the roof . all of his stuff is .
as soon as his being questioned in an
actual string of murders became public .
what do they say ? any publicity &apos;s good publicity .
what are we gonna do with him ?
hotchner .
well , he wants to talk to his manager ,
so maybe we let him make that call
and find out what that guy knows .
it &apos;s worth a try .
you sure ?
ok , thanks .
something ?
that &apos;s the lab .
the saliva samples from the victims &apos; throats--
the dna &apos;s from a woman .
stop . don &apos;t to that .
grandma &apos;s asleep . she &apos;s gonna wake up .
so you have to stop it .
i need to go to the yard .
gina .
gina .
gina .
i &apos;m with the--
fbi .
a woman ? that &apos;s incredibly rare .
but not impossible .
no , but renfield &apos;s with this type of aggression--
it almost never presents this way .
ok , we knew something was wrong .
our profiles have never been this far off , reid .
go back and work it with a woman .
see if there &apos;s anything we may have missed .
you wanted to call your manager .
can i have some privacy ?
that &apos;s not how it works .
ray .
holy hell , man , the record &apos;s gone through the roof .
what do you mean ?
yeah , it &apos;s flying off the shelves .
i told you i &apos;d fix it .
i told you .
yeah , everything &apos;s good .
you &apos;re gonna be back on top ,
everything &apos;s gonna go right back to normal ,
you can stop doing the drugs .
ray , i &apos;m at the police station with the fbi .
i know , i know , i know . don &apos;t worry about it .
don &apos;t worry ?
no , don &apos;t--don &apos;t worry about it .
look , there &apos;s nothing that could be tied to you ,
absolutely nothing .
it &apos;s all good , man .
come on , let &apos;s go . yes .
what did you do , ray ?
the less you know about it the better .
look , i gotta take care of this thing ,
i &apos;ll be down there .
let me just fix this .
ray--
hey , relax , would ya ?
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
did he do something ?
i don &apos;t know .
what did he say ?
he said he &apos;d be down to fix it .
fix what ?
fix this , i suppose .
but he didn &apos;t ask you what &quot; this &quot; was .
no .
gina .
gina .
my name is jennifer jareau .
gina , where &apos;d you go ?
gina ...
who the hell is that ?
what kind of fan mail do you get , mr. vampire ?
a woman--what changes , what doesn &apos;t ?
schizo lust self cutting
older female ...
oh , no .
yeah .
uh , reid ,
uh , i found fan mail to dante .
vampire fan mail . it &apos;s bananas .
obsessional ?
ad infinitum and beyond .
tara &apos;s friend gina--
the stuff she writes--
she--he &apos;s her god . a vampire god .
she lives for him . she said she &apos;ll kill for him .
and she fits every other piece of the profile .
guys !
the girl tara was with before she died--
gina--it &apos;s her .
do you have an address ?
yeah . i think j.j is there right now .
let &apos;s go .
who the hell is she ?
i &apos;m so upset .
it &apos;s all going to go bad .
forget that . you &apos;ve got-- you &apos;ve got to kill her .
it &apos;s all going bad .
listen to me , we &apos;ve got to help dante .
you gotta help dante again .
dante ?
yeah .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s-- he &apos;s gonna be angry .
no , no , no , no . i promise .
he &apos;ll only be angry if you don &apos;t kill this woman .
listen ,
you gotta hurt one more girl
and then you &apos;ll be able to join him in the undead . ok ?
she isn &apos;t answering .
keep trying .
you don &apos;t understand !
i do . i do understand .
you just have to do one more
gina .
and dante will be able to live then .
just one ?
just this one more girl
and then you can join the undead ,
just like we promised .
you said that tara was the last one .
that &apos;s what you said .
you said . now it &apos;s the other girl--
this is the last one .
the last one that you have to do ,
and then you can join dante and be the undead .
just like we talked about , remember ? remember ?
just one ...

and then yourself .
just like he promised .

no , no , please , you have to--
no , no , no , no ! no , no , no !
the blood is going bad !
please ! please don &apos;t do this !
are you armed ?
no , no , no .
no .
go , go !
hey , i got nothing to do with this .
hey , it &apos;s not me .
it &apos;s the chick .
it &apos;s got nothing to do with me .
has something happened ?
it was your manager .
he used a fan of yours .
what ?
a young girl . she &apos;d been writing you letters
about wanting to kill someone for their blood .
i never--i never received anything .
no , he did .
and i guess he thought he could use it for publicity .
he was right .
your new album is selling very well .
i never asked for that .
where is he ?
your manager ? he &apos;s in custody .
is he ok ? is there anything i can do for him ?
he &apos;s gonna need a good lawyer .
what about the girl ?
i don &apos;t know where she &apos;ll end up .
she &apos;s pretty sick .
i &apos;d like to help her , too , if i can .
that &apos;s all ? i can go now ?
that &apos;s all .
you know , all i really ever wanted to do was make music .
hey , do you guys think davies will
continues to perform as dante ?
the character &apos;s probably responsible for the murder of 4 women .
if he has any conscience at all ,
dante died with them .
thanks .
are you ok ?
yeah . doctor said it &apos;ll be sore for a while ,
i feel so bad i didn &apos;t go with you
to interview gina .
spence , stop , all right ?
we had no way of knowing she was gonna be dangerous .
she was just the friend of a victim .
granted , a schizophrenic friend
with a sociopathic partner .
and a shovel .
seriously , reid , we had no way of knowing
that gina had that type of anger inside of her .
yeah , but she was obsessed with dante .
i should have known that that level of fixation
can lead to manipulation .
but only when the fixation &apos;s
coupled with schizophrenia ,
which we had no way of knowing .
still it never ceases to amaze me
how dark obsession can get .
and with a pop star ?
i mean , i was obsessed with the rat pack ,
but i wouldn &apos;t have killed for frank or dean .
no , you just drank whiskey and smoked cigars .
this from the man who &apos;s favorite record
is the beatles &apos; white album .
just because manson hijacked it
doesn &apos;t have to ruin it for the rest of us .
that &apos;s why i stick to beethoven .
there &apos;s no chance of guilt by association .
well , yeah .
have you ever seen a movie called &quot; a clockwork orange &quot; ?
writer cyril connolly said ,
&quot; better to write for yourself and have no public
than to write for the public and have no self . &quot;
