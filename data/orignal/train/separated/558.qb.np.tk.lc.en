第五季 第十一集
cobra !
destroy the taj mahal .
cobra !
not if g.i. joe can help it .
roadblock , deep six .
hold off those hiss tanks .
yo , joe !
hat muffs , spit take ,
shoot down those rattlers .
um , excuse me , sir .
why is cobra attacking a tourist attraction
with zero tactical value ,
and with all due respect to india ,
why are we defending it ?
tightship , you can overhaul g.i. joe
when you &apos;re commander .
which will clearly happen any day now ,
as long as your stay on full display .
whoa , buzzkill , language .
no , you can &apos;t have ice cream for lunch .
put your brother on the phone .
three kids , put down that phone .
we &apos;re in the middle of a battle .
oh , screw you , flint .
i &apos;m in a battle called having three kids .
guys , we &apos;re a squad . you &apos;re making me look bad .
well , if you &apos;re so great , wingman ,
show us how it &apos;s done .
with pleasure .
we &apos;ll meet again , g.i. joe .
good shooting , wingman ,
but it looks like destro &apos;s getting away .
not necessarily , sir .
jeez !
what ? oh , no . what are you doing ?
hey ! are you crazy ? wha--uh--
yo , joe !
what ?
what , we &apos;re-- we &apos;re not saying it together ?
yo , joe !
he &apos;ll fight for freedom , wherever there &apos;s trouble
g.i. joe is there
g.i. joe , american hero
* g.i. joe is there *
it &apos;s g.i. joe against cobra the enemy
fighting to save the day
he never gives up , he &apos;s always there
fighting for freedom over land and air
g.i. joe , a real american hero
g.i. joe is there
g.i. joe is the code name
for america &apos;s daring , awesomely trained ,
awesome mission force .
its purpose-- to fight cobra ,
because they &apos;re terrorists .
look , i think i &apos;m overexplaining it .
the bad guys are snakes ,
and the good guys are army people .
he never gives up
he &apos;ll stay till the fight &apos;s won
g.i. joe will dare
g.i. joe , a real american hero
g.i. joe
wingman , three kids , buzzkill , tightship ,
you stand accused of violence , suggestive language ,
and mature situations unbecoming of g.i. joe .
what say you ?
look , i understand this is the first time
a g.i. joe has killed anyone in all of recorded history .
however--
however , let &apos;s be truthful .
this is a very disorganized militia .
yeah , what &apos;s anyone &apos;s rank ?
we &apos;re all just dressed like serial killers and strippers .
i have three kids .
you guys are not helping .
duke , flint , scarlett ,
yes , it &apos;s true i killed destro .
and i promise not to do it again .
but is it really a crime ?
is cobra not a ruthless terrorist organization
determined to rule the world ?
and if we never kill them ,
are we not basically on their side ?
and won &apos;t this war therefore last forever
unless we finish killing cobra
or start killing ourselves ?
how long are we in here , cold shoulder ?
cold shoulder ?
what &apos;s with that guy ?
&quot; start killing cobra or killing ourselves &quot; ?
we were in the fourth down . it was a hail mary .
this place is a graveyard for g.i. joe rejects .
look who &apos;s in here--
deep dish , shark arms ,
weird head , home free ,
place holder , sleep apnea , and us !
i have three kids .
this is the worst day of my life .
is it life ?
my name is fourth wall .
and i believe that what we perceive as life
is actually a syndicated children &apos;s cartoon .
what ? shut up , fourth wall .
if this were a cartoon , there &apos;d be a word for &quot; cartoon &quot;
in our language , which there isn &apos;t .
there &apos;d also be less movement , less detail ,
and constant lip @-@ sync mistakes .
what if i told you there was more ,
a higher reality ,
with more than 65 colors and at least three dimensions ?
then i guess someone would have to lock you up with the crazy people .
oh , good .
i recently infiltrated a secret cobra dig site ,
code name greendale .
what did you say ?
cobra has discovered an ancient buried structure
filled with strange things .
look .
oh , yeah , look at that .
it &apos;s a child &apos;s toy .
the toy was more real than this at greendale .
what is that word ?
greendale ?
cobra &apos;s out to take over the world ,
but g.i. joe is there .
g.i. joe must be destroyed .
cobra hiss coming for attack !
it &apos;s the new g.i. joe submachopter ,
piloted by wingman .
retreat !
yo , joe !
we are in a toy commercial !
i can &apos;t hear you when you &apos;re covered in rocks .
it doesn &apos;t hurt because it isn &apos;t real .
good job , wingman .
thank you , duke . g.i. joe is my entire life .
yo , joe !
all other figures and vehicles sold separately .
wingman , what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
he clearly has a connection to the non @-@ cartoon reality .
when i mentioned greenda--
shut up . stop saying that word .
you &apos;re some kind of demon man ,
and--and your outfit is three layers of racist .
oh , my god , he &apos;s having an attack .
jeff , can you hear us ? it &apos;s annie .
what did you just call me ?
jeffrey , do you know where you are ?
be quiet . leave me alone .
i @-@ i don &apos;t belong here . i belong in g.i. joe .
ow ! and don &apos;t touch me . who wears a saw on their arm ?
the first time i met destro ,
he asked me if he should have
his entire head coated in chrome .
i said , &quot; no . how would you do that ? &quot;
how would that even work ?
look , i &apos;m not good at eulogies
because i &apos;ve never had to give one .
all i want to know is , how did g.i. joe do this ?
we &apos;ve been shooting at each other and missing for 20 years .
now all of a sudden--
unbelievable . what ?
cobra commander ,
it &apos;s vice cobra assistant commander .
we just got a very interesting energy surge
at the greendale site .
oh , okay . that &apos;s super fascinating .
um , destro &apos;s dead !
oh , my gosh , destro ? were you guys close ?
were we close ? yes !
what kind of a question is--
okay , fine . i loved him !
is that what you want to hear ?
called it .
and we are going to find out how this happened ,
and g.i. joe is going to pay @-@ bra !
i riffed that .
no wrong answers .
it &apos;s a condition that comes on
when you get to a certain weight .
oh , i see .
so is there a mr. tightship , or ...
that &apos;s a code three .
cobra forces are infiltrating the base .
cobra !
avenge my totally platonic friend !
oh , great , and we &apos;re stuck in here .
we don &apos;t have to be .
for 15 years , i have used my trademark tablespoon
to excavate a tunnel ,
swallowing handfuls of dirt and rock with my meals
and listening only to smashmouth
in order to justify this poster .
now i am within inches of reaching the ...
come on , if we help save the base ,
maybe they &apos;ll let us be g.i. joes again .
battle stations !
snakes at 6 : 00 .
okay , now remember @-@ don &apos;t kill anybody .
just lay down a suppressive fire , like this .
oh , my gosh ! i &apos;m sorry .
oh , god .
oh , man . oh , darn it .
yeah , i &apos;d say they &apos;re suppressed .
jeez . aw , was that lifeline ?
sorry !
someone &apos;s killing people .
it &apos;s wingman ! he &apos;s escaped !
lay down a suppressive fire !
they &apos;re suppressive firing at us !
i think we &apos;ll be okay .
remember , this is all just a cartoon
about action figures for kids .
shut up , fourth wall ,
and get into the new g.i. joe submachopter
with twin rocket launchers and rotating attack jet .
all i want to do is be a good g.i. joe .
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
i &apos;m not sure , but i think our answers will be at greendale .
shouldn &apos;t somebody be flying the plane ?
it &apos;s submachopter .
whatever .
will somebody grab the stick ?
i don &apos;t wanna die up here ! oh , lord !
the g.i. joe mutineers are even worse than cobra
because they &apos;re traitors .
buzzkill ...
all government is a lie .
tightship ...
i control everything , or else !
three kids ...
my family comes first .
fourth wall ...
doesn &apos;t this guy also do the voice for he @-@ man commercials ?
and their nefarious ,
ruthless leader , wingman .
hey , that &apos;s not true !
i love g.i. joe !
i don &apos;t know , man . seems like you hate it .
this is all a misunderstanding .
tell it to the judge .
everything is sold separately . assembly required .
nothing is happening .
cartoon coffee ?
tightship is piloting the submachopter .
at first it was buzzkill , but she almost crashed five times ,
and when we pointed it out ,
she called us sexist and went to the bathroom .
you know she &apos;s smoking in there , right ?
she broke the detector . that &apos;s a federal crime .
i keep having these visions .
kids , little boys ...
uh , are these visions we should share with the authorities ?
i want to go to this greendale place now .
we &apos;re on our way .
do you remember greendale , jeffrey ?
why did you call me that ? what &apos;s with you people ?
what do you mean , &quot; you people &quot; ?
oh !
nice .
that &apos;s the entrance to the excavation site .
how do we get past those guards ?
i think i got an idea .
your idea was doing exactly what we did
to those other guards back at headquarters ?
it was proven effective .
i don &apos;t know , seems kind of cheap .
from an animated perspective , very cheap .
help me club this hatch open .
i know this place .
it &apos;s filling me with a sense of endless hours for unfair wages
and printers that never have toner .
what is this , major dick ?
that is a request for hazard pay .
maybe you haven &apos;t heard ,
but we can actually die now .
you know we can &apos;t afford this .
oh , so we can afford to create
a new model of weaponized vehicle once a week ,
but we basically get minimum wage to risk our lives .
well , welcome to cobra , ximxam .
maybe you noticed our logo was a snake ?
suck it up , guys !
and while i have your attention , here .
what is this ?
we have to lower the salaries . our insurance is going up .
no way .
what ?
hey , you people can actually die now .
it affects the health plan .
vice cobra assistant commander ,
we &apos;ve been infiltrated by joes !
well ?
protect me !
hello , greendale .
i understand g.i. joe has breached the perimeter .
please eliminate them .
and please don &apos;t forget this saturday is the cobra fun run .
if you miss it , you &apos;re letting the antiterrorists win .
ugh , overkill .
yes , it &apos;s me .
but which me
is the real me ?
probably the one in the middle .
the middle , right ?
aah ! ow , my leg ! ow !
now , before you fight me , g.i. joe ,
you should be warned .
i , ximxam , have a twin brother named mixmax
that feels all my pain .
and how is that supposed to affect us ?
psychologically ?
today &apos;s soup is a carrot puree
with a ... ow ! damn it ! aah !
sorry . my twin brother is a ...
it &apos;s pointless to explain .
hurts so much ! right ?
it shredded my meniscus !
whup ! whup ! whup !
shouldn &apos;t have done that . ooh .
nope . don &apos;t like that sound .
incredible .
it &apos;s as if there &apos;s something about this place
that feeds on ambition .
i came from here . i work here .
my name is jeff winger . and you &apos;re annie .
and ... and shirley .
and abed and britta .
britta ? what kind of lame name is that ?
i wanna be buzzkill because of my awesome saw .
you guys are my friends in real life .
this is my imagination or something .
freeze , everybody !
don &apos;t make me zap you !
craig , it &apos;s me , jeff .
jeffrey ! are you okay ?
no , he &apos;s not . take it from an expert in delusion .
if jeff &apos;s hallucinating something this cool ,
something &apos;s wrong , he needs to get back .
wingman , do you have your wingpack ,
or is it sold separately ?
here it is .
that &apos;s good , my fourth wall penetrating powers
combined with this medium &apos;s lack of internal logic
should allow me to come up with an oversimplified solution .
i &apos;ll be right back . i have to get something .
what ?
the truth .
oh , crap .
ah , jeff , while you were gone ,
i figured everything out
and did everything that needs to be done .
this may be your delusion , but i &apos;m still the one on the ball .
i know why i &apos;m here . i &apos;m unconscious .
jeff winger &apos;s unconscious , because he ...
i drank a fifth of scotch .
and i took some pills .
jeffrey , shame on you . i have three kids .
are you saying you tried to ...
no , they were these stupid youth pills
that i bought in koreatown .
i took them because it &apos;s my birthday and ...
i &apos;ve been lying about my age .
yeah , it &apos;s not something i &apos;m really ready to deal with .
i guess you found a way to deal with it
unconsciously through a psychotic break .
happens to the best of us .
now , these are the three layers of reality .
we are in the cartoon layer .
it &apos;s separated from the live @-@ action layer
by a dangerous mid @-@ layer called children &apos;s toy commercials ,
which i believe you &apos;re seeing in your visions .
i &apos;ve modified your wingpack to break this barrier , and ...
i &apos;m not going back .
jeff , you have to go back .
i don &apos;t wanna be a middle @-@ aged community college teacher .
i wanna be in g.i. joe .
i wanna fight for freedom
wherever there &apos;s trouble forever .
jeff , that &apos;s your ten @-@ year @-@ old self talking .
you &apos;ve receded into some infantile part of your mind .
imaginary britta is right . and only imaginary britta .
in these visions you &apos;re having ,
a giant child is controlling you .
you have to get away from him .
i am him ! that &apos;s the point .
i created this . i chose this .
but do you understand that the real jeff winger
is in some kind of actual , real medical jeopardy ?
like the kind in a one @-@ hour drama ?
jeff , please . i don &apos;t want you to die .
can you hear me ?
i &apos;m only dying out there , annie .
in here we &apos;re immortal .
look at the rack i gave you .
those are gonna stay right where they are for an eternity .
you &apos;re welcome .
yo , jobra !
&quot; yo , jobra &quot; ?
we talked it over and realized that since
none of us can kill each other , we might as well team up .
seeing as we &apos;ve got a common enemy .
seize them !
you can &apos;t seize me .
i am the creator of your reality .
i am neo in the third act of the matrix .
i &apos;m also neo in the first act of the second matrix .
i didn &apos;t get around to seeing the third one ,
but my guess is ... oh !
cobra and g.i. joe have finally united .
do you guys need anything ?
we could probably use some milk .
let &apos;s go get some milk for g.i. joe .
i &apos;ll wait it out in this cell until you guys can reeducate me .
yo , jobra !
yo , jobra .
all figures come with their own accessories .
wingman sold separately or something .
ah , look who &apos;ssssss conscious again .
you &apos;re pretty selective with those snake &quot; s &quot; s .
what are you , my life coach ?
i &apos;d make fun of some physical detail about you ,
but there aren &apos;t any .
you look like some aryan foosball figure .
guys , you don &apos;t have to keep me prisoner .
i want what you want .
we can &apos;t just have you running around , wingman .
you &apos;re too powerful .
so let &apos;s share the power .
we can be gods here forever .
for realsies ?
absolutely . i don &apos;t wanna leave here .
i wanna hang out with you guys and blow stuff up .
hmm . all right .
yo , jobra .
yo , jobra .
yo , jobra .
say , do you mind if we ask you a few questions about real life ?
no problem .
ask .
so ...
what do boobies look like ?
wait . you don &apos;t know ?
you guys have never seen a naked woman ?
you don &apos;t have to make us feel bad .
have you guys ever tasted scotch ?
does scotch liquor exist here ?
you know what ?
can i just go to the bathroom real quick ?
sure . it &apos;s the second door over there on the right .
hey ! we can &apos;t go to the bathroom !
fool ! he &apos;s getting away !
this had better work .
no , no , no , wait !
get off me ! i wanna go home !
take me with you ! i want to see women &apos;s boobs !
we can &apos;t both go !
you &apos;re slowing me down ! let go !
i can feel it ! yes !
i can feel reality !
i &apos;ve never felt so alive !
because you &apos;re fictional ! you can &apos;t survive this !
wait , why does my back hurt ?
why do i just have random pains in my body ?
why is my ability to appreciate new music diminishing ?
need to gain speed before ...
wingman is trying to escape g.i. joe ,
and it &apos;s up to you to hold him back
with your inner child &apos;s hand .
damn it , i didn &apos;t make it .
i &apos;m not controlling him ! he &apos;s doing this himself !
screw you , kid !
ow ! he burnt my hand .
the wingman wingpack is not available in stores .
you control the toy .
you control it , my ass .
what is it doing ?
making a man of you .
everything sold separately .
everyone dies eventually .
nobody gets out alive .
his eyes are opening .
yeah , but that happens when people die too .
jeff ! jeffrey !
wait , britta , don &apos;t slap him !
jeffrey , it &apos;s me , the dean . i &apos;m right here .
wait , wait , no , no , i think you have to ...
oh , stop it , i &apos;m awake .
jeff , you &apos;ve been keeping your birthday a secret ?
yeah . most people have cake .
not a fifth of scotch and what the hell else .
&quot; age reverse , life extend power &quot; ?
this is korean .
okay , what am i ?
chinese !
okay , i swear to god i feel korean .
guys ...
i &apos;m 40 .
what ?
wow . i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah , we knew that .
you know , i guess we knew that
you had to be around 30 when we met .
yeah , and it has been five years .
and even if he had been 32 , we &apos;d have to know he would be ...
this isn &apos;t helping .
you guys know i &apos;m 38 , right ?
i &apos;m kidding .
but , jeff , you shouldn &apos;t almost die over a number .
what &apos;s important are ranges of numbers .
you &apos;re still 18 to 49 for almost a decade .
that &apos;s valuable to society .
you have any more of these pills left ?
i had the craziest dream .
it was all animated
and a g.i. joe cartoon , and you were all in it .
in it ? how much ?
what clothes did you draw me in ?
mm , fully animated ?
but it was all a dream because you were unconscious .
remember that christmas when i ...
yes !
jeff , here &apos;s your present .
slim pickings at the hospital gift shop ,
but we made do .
&quot; it &apos;s a old boy . &quot;
yes . he is a old boy .
he &apos;s a old boy .
bring it in , guys .
jeff !
hey , listen , i got a former partner
that &apos;s been here since &apos; 89 in a coma , so ... hmm .
1889 ?
winger , you &apos;re funny .
this is cool ! make my name too .
what are you guys , cavemen ?
buzzkill !
what you &apos;re doing is a waste of spray paint .
we live in a fascist police state disguised as democracy .
you think you &apos;re gonna shatter that illusion
by celebrating your own meaningless identities ?
is church over yet ?
fourth wall !
a good syndicated cartoon has a lesson at the end .
but getting heavy @-@ handed or preachy could turn
an entire generation into jaded , sarcastic babies .
be friendly and direct .
and keep the message simple .
graffiti is bad . go play sports .
cool !
i get it !
i was trying to hold them to a higher standard .
if the media tells kids what to think , all they &apos;ll know is ...
and knowing is half the battle .
what ?
