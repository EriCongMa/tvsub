oh , my god . i love this chicken .
oh , you know what they say ,
best things in life are free .
okay , you &apos;re right . i eat your food a lot .
now , how about this ?
you can raid my fridge anytime you want .
oh , that &apos;s very kind of you .
next time i have a hankering to wash down a d @-@ cell battery
with a jar of old pickle juice ,
i &apos;ll come a @-@ knockin &apos; .
hey , raj , you didn &apos;t send your rsvp in .
i &apos;m suppose to ask you if you &apos;re bringing someone to the wedding .
i &apos;ll let you know .
well , can you make it soon ?
there &apos;s a battle royale going on over the seating charts .
in one corner , bernadette &apos;s mom ,
in the other three , mine .
yeah , i hate wedding receptions .
yeah , i wish the bride and groom would take a cue from bilbo baggins .

slip on the ring , disappear , and everyone goes home .
mm , you liked professor geyser &apos;s wedding .
they had a make @-@ your @-@ own @-@ sundae bar .
oh , that was a night to remember .
do you know , on one trip , i just had a bowl of nuts .
anyway , you got to let me know if you have a plus one .
because if not , my mom &apos;s trying to sneak in the doctor
who sucked the fat out of her neck .
all right , uh , fine .
i &apos;m coming and i &apos;m bringing somebody .
uh , koothrappali plus one .
who you bringing ?
who are you bringing ? !
he &apos;s bringing me ; who are you bringing ?
wow , what a bunch of nosey o &apos;donnells .
come on , who is it ?
i &apos;m not telling .
i &apos;m from asia , i &apos;m mysterious , deal with it .
howard aren &apos;t having a make @-@ your @-@ own @-@ sundae bar ?
i don &apos;t think so .
well , you should .
50 % of marriages end in divorce ,
but 100 % of make @-@ your @-@ own @-@ sundae bars end in happiness .
hello , mummy , daddy . how are you ?
pretty good . can &apos;t complain .
oh , i &apos;m sure you can .
just give it a minute .
listen , uh ,
there &apos;s something i want to talk to you about .
i wasn &apos;t ready until now , but ...
i think it &apos;s time .
it &apos;s finally happening .
you &apos;re coming out of the closet , aren &apos;t you ?
we love you , and we accept your alternate lifestyle .
just ... keep it to yourself .
no , i &apos;m not gay .
if anything , i &apos;m metrosexual .
what &apos;s that ?
it means i like women as well as their skin @-@ care products .
well , if you &apos;re not coming out ,
why did you call us during the cricket semifinals ?
i &apos;m tired of trying to meet someone ,
and i think i &apos;d like you to help me find a ...
a wife .
and just to clarify ...
a female wife ?
yes !
matchmaking-- very smart move , son .
much better than marrying for love .
we married for love .
and it &apos;s been wonderful !
quantum physics makes me so happy .
yeah , i &apos;m glad .
it &apos;s like looking at the universe naked .
hi . guys got a minute ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
well , i was thinking about sheldon &apos;s little joke
the other night about me eating all your food .
oh ! that was no joke . but ...
i understand your confusion ,
as i am our group &apos;s resident cutup .
i &apos;m sorry , you are our resident cutup ?
yes .
oh , prove it .
knock @-@ knock .
who &apos;s there ?
interrupting physicist .
interrupting phys ...

anyway , i got a little residual check from my commercial ,
and i thought , hey , how about i get the guys
a little thank you to pay them back ?
so , sheldon ...
ta @-@ da !
a vintage mint @-@ in @-@ box
1975 mego star trek transporter
with real transporter action .
hot darn !
where did you get that ?
from stuart , at the comic book store .
you went to the comic book store by yourself ?
yeah . it was fun .
i walked in , and two different guys got asthma attacks .
felt pretty good .
this calls for an expression of gratitude .
ooh , am i about to get a rare sheldon cooper hug ?
no , not this time . then they wouldn &apos;t be special .
thanks , penny .
you &apos;re welcome .
don &apos;t worry , i didn &apos;t forget about you .
leonard , i got you ...
a label @-@ maker !
wow ...
no , it &apos;s great .
also mint @-@ in @-@ box . mm .
and i got you a transporter , too !
awesome !
look , it was actually designed for my vintage mr. spock action figure .
oh , that &apos;s great ! let &apos;s open them up and put him in there .
open it ? !
oh , good lord , no !
why ? they &apos;re just toys .
they &apos;re collectibles .
they &apos;re mint @-@ in @-@ box .
come on . can &apos;t we open one up and take a look ?
no , don &apos;t !
once you open the box , it loses its value .
yeah , yeah . my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity .
gotta tell you , it was a lot more fun
taking it out and playing with it .
are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman ?
oh , yes .
in my culture , it &apos;s expected
to have a chaperone to oversee a first date .
plus , i want to make a good impression , and no offense ,
but with you guys here , i look like i &apos;m six @-@ two .
the nuns always chaperoned the dances at my high school .
they used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit .
uh , hindus do the same thing .
except they leave room for a cow .
listen , i love your charming racist humor ,
but any chance you could not mock my religion while she &apos;s here ?
yesterday , you made fun of me for eating lox .
it &apos;s different , your people don &apos;t worship lox .
clearly , you &apos;ve never been to brunch with my cousins .
so , arranged marriages-- the parents just decide
and then you have to get married ?
no , no , i get a say in it .
but i &apos;m sure whoever shows up will be better company
than the threesome i &apos;ve been having
with aunt jemima and mrs. butterworth .
excuse me , are you rajesh ?
ah , yes .
you must be lakshmi .
uh , nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
oh ! these are my friends .
this is bernadette .
hello .
and this is howard .
nice to meet you .
you , too .
please , have a seat .
i &apos;m thinking double wedding .
dr. cooper .
dr. cooper ?
is someone there ?
down here . on your desk .
spock ?
i need to speak with you .
fascinating .
the only logical explanation is that this is a dream .
it is not the only logical explanation .
for example , you could be hallucinating
after being hit on the head by , say ,
a coconut .
was i hit on the head by a coconut ?
i am not going to dignify that with a response .
now to the matter at hand .
you need to play with the transporter toy .
but it &apos;s mint @-@ in @-@ box .
yes .
and to open it would destroy its value .
but remember , like me ,
you also have a human half .
well , i &apos;m not going to dignify that with a response .
consider this .
what is the purpose of a toy ?
to be played with .
therefore , to not play with it would be ... ?
illogical .
damn it , spock , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll do it .
sheldon , wait .
you have to wake up first .
oh , of course .
set phasers to dumb , right ?
goodie , goodie , goodie !
this is wrong , this is wrong .
i &apos;m so excited , but this is wrong .
i &apos;m going to do it .
i &apos;m doing it .
i did it .
that &apos;s what i always thought 1975 smelled like .
one to beam down , mr. scott .
aye , aye , mr. spock .
energize .
energize .
don &apos;t be broken .
oh , please , don &apos;t be broken .
what did you make me do ? !
okay , okay , think .
it &apos;s only logical .
my goodness , that was delicious .
well , i hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake .
impressive .
what goes into making something like that ?
well , you start out by trying to
make chocolate souffl ? and when it falls , you panic ,
quickly change the name , and voila , lava cake .
i bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here .
well , let &apos;s see .
yep , three missed calls .
four missed calls , two text messages
and a failed video chat . i win !
so , what are we going to tell them ?
i &apos;d like to tell them things are going well .
me , too .
but before we get their hopes up ,
we should probably make sure we &apos;re on the same page .
okay .
what page are you on ?
i &apos;m on the one where i &apos;m under a lot of pressure
from my parents to get married and settle down
and have a family ,
and i &apos;m going to do it so they don &apos;t find out i &apos;m gay .
say again ?
i &apos;m gay .
like ... dude @-@ on @-@ dude ,
but with women ?
i know a fake marriage isn &apos;t an honest way to live ,
but you of all people should know how difficult it is
to come out in our culture .
why me of all people ? !
well , there &apos;s a rumor back in new delhi that you &apos;re--
how shall we say--
comfortable in a sari .
i &apos;m not gay !
really ? the chocolate lava cake ,
the little soaps in the bathroom ,
and i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re wearing more perfume than i am .
that &apos;s unbreakable by khloe and lamar .
and for your information , it &apos;s unisex .
fill in the blank .
i love the nightlife ...
i like to boogie .
got you .
with women ! i like to boogie with women !
that &apos;s disappointing .
you were exactly the kind of phony @-@ baloney husband
i was looking for .
thank you .
and once again , my baloney likes girls .
w @-@ w @-@ wait !
you don &apos;t want to put a bite of that in your mouth
without trying my homemade chantilly cream .
yeah , okay , that time i heard it .
oh , dear .
two suns and no sunscreen .
hello again , sheldon .
what is it now , tiny spock ?
i am very disappointed in you .
you broke your toy and switched it with leonard &apos;s .
you should be ashamed of yourself .
you &apos;re the one who told me to play with it .
if i told you to jump off the bridge of the enterprise ,
would you do it ?
oh , if i got on the bridge of the enterprise ,
i would never , ever leave .
trust me , it gets old after a while .
you must right your wrongs , sheldon .
why ? i got away with it .
leonard has his toy , and he &apos;s never going to open it ,
so he won &apos;t know it &apos;s broken .
and i have a toy that isn &apos;t broken .
everybody &apos;s happy .
well , i am unhappy .
i thought where you come from they don &apos;t have emotions .
瓦肯人是个几乎能克制所有情感的种族
i come from a factory in taiwan .
now , do the right thing .
you know what you are ?
well , you &apos;re a green @-@ blooded buzz kill .
perhaps it &apos;s time you beam on out of here .
fine .
i will just use the transporter .
oh , right .
you broke it .
very well .
cooper to enterprise , one to beam up .
energize .
tiny spock , help .
ready for lunch ?
yeah , one sec .
oh , good . ma would &apos;ve killed me
if she found out i broke my retainer .
can i run something by you ? it &apos;s about lakshmi .
yeah , sure . how are things going ?
we hit a couple of bumps .
she lives over in manhattan beach ,
so it takes , like , an hour to get there .
and she &apos;s a lesbian .
what do you mean , &quot; she &apos;s a lesbian &quot; ?
well , you know how whenever you and i would try
to hit on women in bars and they &apos;d blow us off
and then we &apos;d tell each other they were probably gay ?
it &apos;s like that .
except this time , it &apos;s true .
then why did she even go out with you ?
she was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight .
and , you know ,
it sounded crazy to me at first ...
but i &apos;m actually thinking about doing it .
okay , so the reason that might sound crazy ...
is &apos; cause it &apos;s crazy !
look , howard , you &apos;re in a relationship .
you know you have to make compromises .
yes , but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy
or whose turn it is to do the laundry ,
bernadette &apos;s or my mom &apos;s .
it &apos;s a great deal .
we both get our parents off our backs ,
i don &apos;t have to come home to an empty apartment every night .
plus , once i &apos;m married , i can finally eat carbs again
and let myself go .
why don &apos;t you tell your parents
you want to try to find someone else ?
maybe one who hasn &apos;t slept with more woman than you .
because this one wants to marry me .
i might never find another one who does .
so you &apos;re seriously thinking about marrying someone
you &apos;re never gonna have sex with ?
i can &apos;t believe your attitude .
i thought you were in favor of gay people getting married .
yes , to other gay people !
do you hear how homophobic you sound ?
oh , i don &apos;t want a broken toy .
nothing !
what ?
nothing . i said nothing .
that was weird .
really ? i don &apos;t even notice anymore .
i cannot believe you guys aren &apos;t gonna play with these .
well , i told you , you don &apos;t . it &apos;s mint @-@ in @-@ box .
i don &apos;t know . i just think it &apos;s a waste .
relax . i &apos;m just looking at the box .
perhaps you should look with your eyes
and not your muscular nebraska man hands .
what is your problem ? !
my problem is that i don &apos;t want you to break leonard &apos;s toy .
which you probably did by shaking it !
she shook it , we all saw her .
leonard , i bought you this
&apos;cause i wanted you to have fun with it .
i don &apos;t want it to sit in this box .
you know , you &apos;re right .
i mean , it &apos;s from you ,
i &apos;m never gonna sell it .
i &apos;m opening it .
yes !
it &apos;s broken .
what ?
oh , nice job , man hands !
i didn &apos;t break it .
i guess stuart sold it to me like this .
yes . yes , he did .
that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explana ...
let &apos;s all be mad at stuart !
you know , i paid a lot for this .
let &apos;s take it over there and show him .
absolutely .
wait !
it was me .
i opened your toy ...
discovered it was broken and didn &apos;t tell you .
why would you open mine ?
i didn &apos;t . that was a lie .
i opened my own toy ...
and it was already broken , so i switched them .
you should talk to stuart .
i can &apos;t , because that was a lie .
yours was broken in an earthquake--
and that &apos;s a lie .
what is the truth ?
my mr. spock doll came to me in a dream
and forced me to open it .
and when the toy broke , i switched it for yours .
later , he encouraged me to do the right thing ,
and i defied him .
and then i was attacked by a gorn .
okay , that i believe .
leonard , penny , i just , i want you both to know
that i regret my actions towards the two of you .
that &apos;s a lie .
so , is that one mine ?
yes .
well , hand it over so i can open it .
okay .
and , leonard , even though i don &apos;t have one anymore ,
i hope you have fun playing with it .
and that &apos;s a lie , right ?
it &apos;s a big , fat whopper .
i hope it breaks .
this is a treat .
what brings you guys by ?
raj , howie told me what &apos;s going on with you and lakshmi .
you told her ?
i told everybody .
we believe there &apos;s someone out there who will love you for you .
actually , we kind of agreed to disagree on that one ,
but we both think you shouldn &apos;t marry this woman .
so , while i &apos;m waiting for this mysterious perfect match
who may or may not exist , i &apos;m supposed to just be alone ?
not necessarily .
i think we found someone for you to cuddle with .
oh , my goodness .
aren &apos;t you the cutest little yorkie ever !
you got him for me ?
her . we thought you two would hit it off .
i think we already have .
thank you guys so much .
let &apos;s go see if you fit in my man purse .
heterosexual , my ass .
