Thanks Bill, now let's take a look at the traffic
around the Boston area today.
It's a light day because of the holiday --
And even if you heading to Logan Airport,
The traffic is flowing even through the Williams Tunnel,
If you're lucky enough to have the day off
It is one gorgeous day in Boston ...
Let's go, Janie! Crush it!
Easy out here.
Come on, Jane. Homicide.
Wait for yours. Wait for the one you like.
Come on, Jane!
You ready, Janie.
Don't call me "Janie."
Okay, Janie.
He can call you whatever he wants.
You're a traitor.
And you're a choker.
Yeah, I'm handling your cheap Cologne all right.
Come on, Grant.
You've been working drugs too long.
Oh! Good cut, good cut!
My grandma could have hit that ball.
Your grandma has balls.
Stroke up! That's how Crystl Bustos won the gold!
Come on! Upstroke!
How long you been playing?
Me?
Yeah.
Never played.
Love the uniform.
Water-resistant,
One-layer skin made with Dyneema.
It's light and comfortable, actually,
Due to intrinsic cooling properties.
It fits nice, too.
Let's go, Janie! Crush it!
Upstroke!
Wind at 10 knots!
Thank you, Maura.
Come on, Jane!
All right, all right!
Nice catch!
Yes! Good hit, Jane!
Maura!
Oh, she's letting me play.
Get a hit, I'll buy you dinner.
You're on.
Maura, no, no, no.
Maura.
Screw it.
Give me a fast one. Right down the middle.
Oh!
What?
No I.D.
Was she dead before she was tossed?
I'd be guessing.
I won't tell.
Ballpark. Two hours.
"Ballpark"?
I guess I do owe you dinner.
I love modern Provencal.
Oh, my god. You're flirting over a dead body.
When else am I going to do it?
Cafe Cote d'Azur, 7:00?
I'll call it in.
Okay, you're drugs, we're homicide.
We got it.
Okay. It's your day off. I was just trying to help.
Thank you.
See ya.
Perfect enamel layer.
No deterioration of abutting gingiva.
English.
She's a flosser.
No witnesses.
Not that many cars use this overpass.
But Frankie found this.
1960s, Chrysler, 300f.
Wedge engine.
It's, uh, distinctive and pleasing.
Yeah, it's from the suspect's car.
You're never gonna make homicide.
You keep jumping to conclusions like that, all right?
You don't know where this came from.
Get me everything you can, all right?
He looks up to you.
You're an only child. Get yourself a brother,
and we'll talk.
Hey, can I borrow your radio?!
Thanks a lot.
I mean, yes, all right,
I would like to help him make homicide detective.
But he's just... He's not ready.
You are deceptively complex. I do not understand you.
Well, you would if I was a dead body.
Do you think so?
Victor 825, I got a full notifications.
I got one full notifications down here at revere park.
Do you think it was deliberate?
Well, somebody knew we were here.
I'd say they want to play ball.
Korsak, you okay?
Aced your sergeant's exam. That's great.
Save it. Passed me over. Again.
It's juice. I don't got juice.
No, no, it's -- it's political, all right?
How do you think I feel?
They didn't even let women in this unit till 1988.
More people to get promoted ahead of me -- great!
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Drug unit has more space.
No, this is okay.
Uh, lieutenant's office is through there,
Empty since Ray was promoted.
You lost, Joey?
Can I talk to you for a second, detective Rizzoli?
Yeah, why not?
What do you want?
Okay, look.
I know you've got a problem with me.
"The habitual difficulty in prayer is,
"'a,' distraction, 'b,' lack of grace,
'c,' selfishness, or, 'd,' dryness."
Dryness.
No. You still don't know.
You cheated off my catechism test.
We were 8 years old. And, no, I didn't.
Yes, you did. And I know it was you who put a mallard duck
in my locker in 7th grade.
You don't like cold duck?
It crapped all over my math homework.
No, not so much.
You and I are gonna have to figure out some way to get along.
Why?
Because I'm your new lieutenant.
Commissioner gave me homicide command.
Right. 'cause you've got juice.
And I might have kissed a little brass on the way up.
But I also made hundreds of cases.
Korsak's made thousands. He didn't get promoted.
Korsak is sitting at that desk for a reason.
The same reason you'll be sitting there in 20 years.
You don't know how to get along.
Me -- I'll barely have time for a cup of coffee
before I'm out of that office and moving on up.
Good.
You know, you're exactly the same.
And I'm gonna need everything you got on that strangling victim.
Yes, sir. Lieutenant, sir.
That's strike one, Rizzoli.
You got two left.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...I am your new lieutenant.
I just want to say I'm very excited to be working with all of you.
I keep an open-door policy.
Let's make this a tight-knit team.
Oh, and...
There will be no more parking in front of the building.
Oh, come on.
It's a security.
4-inch curvilinear contusion.
See the patterned abrasions?
Mm-hmm. From the terry cloth.
He didn't use his hands, so she was clutching at the ligature,
fighting for her life.
It takes 20 to 30 seconds to render someone unconscious.
One, postmortem trauma... Two, postmortem trauma...
No, I got it. Strangling sucks. - Three, postmortem --
Depends who you're choking. Can you believe that?
I get kicked to the curb, Grant gets the brass ring.
Well, he's a -- a legend in the drug unit.
Perhaps he's a little nicer off the mound.
Oh, yeah, he's fantastic. I want to kill myself.
What's the best way?
Uh, atlanto-occipital disarticulation is very fast.
No idea what that is. What else you got?
I miss anything?
We were just about to start the "Y" Incision.
Oh, goody.
Gore never bothered me.
My first autopsy was a burn victim,
Hands curled up like this.
Guys thought I'd turn into a little girl.
Grabbed the fingers,
Looking for some skin to rehydrate and get a print.
Snapped off, like pretzels.
Knock it off, Korsak.
Sink.
You hungry, Frost? Huh?
You want to grab a tomato soup.
You want to know what I'm thinking?
It's so weird. I do.
I'm thinking I know why you're making such a big deal
Out of the fact that Grant's your new boss.
I don't want to know what you're thinking.
You two like each other.
No.
Do you know what that ass used to call me? Frog face.
It's not funny, Maura. It's -- no.
It's not funny.
I'm not a frog face.
No.
You know, I have an hour to finish this
before dinner with my hot new guy.
Oh, my god. It's gnocchi night.
Listen. Um, I'll call you.
Later, okay?
...14 home runs.
Got this one. Chopped it towards second.
Could be two...
Can you believe this?
I can't believe it.
Who invited you?
Nice to see you, too.
Hi, daddy. Mwah.
Hi, honey.
Hello, jo Friday. Hello.
Yes, I know. Come on, swing!
Don't let that dog lick you. It's unsanitary.
So, I hear you got a pinch hitter tossed into your game.
Yeah, Frankie told you about the strangling victim.
Okay, that's not dinner talk.
We're not eating.
We're not eating, ma.
By the way, you're the one who wanted to learn
how to make grandma's gnocchi.
Okay, okay. I'm coming.
Aw, come on, ma.
You didn't put the potato peels down the garbage disposal.
Come on.
Well, if you were home a little more,
I would have known not to do that.
Oh, come on! Tag him!
Aw, dad, can we get a little help, please?
Yeah, what's the problem?
You're always working. That's the problem.
Ang, come on. Leave her alone.
Janie, where are the tools?
Uh, in the hall closet.
Frankie, give me a hand over here, all right?
Yeah?
Okay.
Thank you, daddy.
Daddy needs help.
Dad, what do you need?
What did you say?
What?
Nothing. Everything's okay.
He needs Frankie Jr. to take over the business.
I mean, Frankie belongs at Rizzoli and Sons,
Not out on the streets.
He's not a homeless person. He's a cop, ma.
Just point out to him all the things you've missed, okay?
He listens to you.
The things I -- w-what have I missed?
What, a clogged sink?
No, like... Children who love you.
A husband who adores you.
Damn it. Ang, why did you do this?
Okay, did I know that you couldn't put the potatoes in the sink?
Just fix it. You know how to do that.
Well, next time, think.
Okay, I'll -- I'll do that. I'll think.
Frankie needs a wife.
Why? He has you.
No! No, you're not -- - No, no.
Rizzoli.
Yeah. All right, I'll be right there.
Did you catch another homicide?
None of your business. Fix my sink.
Okay, princess.
Hmm. He tucked her in.
When's the last time we had two stranglings in one day?
Well, cheer up. Maybe tomorrow will be stabbing day.
I don't -- I-I don't like this.
It's the same M.O. as the softball girl.
Sophie Clark -- 22.
What are you doing here?
I'm working. It's my sector.
Since when?
Since I asked for a new sector.
I want to learn from the best.
So, where is Korsak?
That's funny.
That's great.
You like that?
Yeah.
Well, you're welcome.
Rizzoli.
Okay, thanks.
We've got an I.D. on the first victim.
Mary Sullivan, Sophie...Clark.
That's weird.
Uh, run it again.
Check the cold case database.
Why?
Just do it.
Oh, wow, Sophie Clark...
was a victim of the Boston Strangler, 1962.
He got Mary Mullivan in '64.
Yeah, we got him in '67 --
Albert Desalvo.
He confessed to all 13 of the murders.
He died in prison in...
Uh, '73. Stabbed by an inmate.
Rizzoli, think.
We got two new stranglings -- same names.
It's a bizarre coincidence. Or we've got a copycat.
No.
Some veteran cops never believed
Desalvo was the Boston Strangler.
Yeah, lots of cops do.
So why is it a cold case?
An open homicide investigation, Jane.
Never solved.
Come on. What are you telling me?
That the Boston Strangler is back?
I was 10 when it started.
The city went bonkers -- panic like you've never seen.
Yeah, probably because women were being strangled
in their own apartments from '62 to '64.
And the Boston cops couldn't catch him.
People don't like that. My mom still talks about it.
People were furious with the cops.
The bosses would have done anything
to get the public off their backs.
It was like Jack the Ripper found Boston.
Yeah, you're forgetting one thing --
Desalvo confessed.
Because he loved the attention.
Told you -- banana head.
All right, then how did he know details?
You know, the apartment layouts,
the way the bodies were strangled.
Read his interviews.
He was a serial rapist in and out of the clink.
Shared a cell with the real strangler is what some think.
Korsak, it's been 40 years.
Even if the "Real" Strangler has been behind bars
and he just got paroled, he'd -- he'd be in his 60s.
Hey, Mick Jagger's in his 60s.
Oh, well, that's our first suspect.
I was a little disappointed when I moved to Boston
后因出现在朗费罗的诗中而得以传颂
and found out that Paul Revere
didn't actually do the midnight ride.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know what you mean.
I mean, I understand -- Longfellow couldn't write,
作品《保罗·保维尔的夜奔》
"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
the midnight ride of William...Dawes."
Still.
Is there anything that you don't know?
Of course.
I read an article about the initial plasma state,
uh, that followed the big bang.
And the universe was at its highest level of entropy,
which was... fascinating, and you don't really care.
I...I like science.
No apologies. I like you.
Your skin is a little... Rough.
Oh. I'm sorry. I shaved.
Abnormal joint flexibility.
I would be happy to show you that later.
Do you have flat feet?
That's really second-date material,
but...Yeah.
Oh. Shoot.
Nearsighted?
Yeah. Why?
Marfan Syndrome.
Yeah, it explains the dolichostenomelia.
Excuse me. The doli-what?
Dolichostenomelia.
Sorry, e-elongated limbs.
You're suffering from a genetic disorder of the connective tissue.
It's called Marfan Syndrome.
If this is your idea of foreplay, it's not working.
No, it -- the heart damage is the biggest issue.
But life expectancy has increased considerably.
What?
Nate -- wait, I'm...
Nate, Nate, why are you -- where are you going?
Call my doctor. Good night.
Well, I didn't believe it either.
But then I went through the evidence, all right?
The strangler had a signature way
of tying the ligatures into a bow.
Yeah, but that's all public record.
No, no, no, not this detail. That was never released.
So, what are you telling me?
Are you telling me that, more than 40 years
after the Boston Strangler stopped killing, the -- the guy's back?
Well, maybe. Yeah.
How is that possible, detective? He's dead.
No. No. Desalvo, the guy who confessed, is dead.
What if, this whole time, the real Boston Strangler
has been behind bars and now he's out?
We -- track the timeline. Look, okay.
The killings stopped after Desalvo was locked up, right?
They start up again two days ago.
No. I-it's a different guy.
It's the same M.O.
He -- he -- he goes after women who live alone.
There's no sign of forced entry,
so he either knows them,
or he talks his way in.
I mean, come on, he's picking victims
with the same names as the Boston Strangler.
I mean, this guy's practically yelling, "I'm back!"
We -- we got to find these women.
We got to warn them.
No, we don't.
Okay, it's not gonna happen.
Two words I do not want to hear together again --
"Boston" and "Strangler."
That case nearly buried this city.
So... I ignore the obvious links?
I am telling you that these new murders
have nothing to do with the Boston Strangler.
If you want to work here, solve them.
You know, I remember you
when you cared more about the people than the politics.
What did you bring me down here for?
We're gonna crack this case.
In the basement?
Know what's up there?
Yes, that is where I take my naps.
All the old files of the Boston Strangler case.
I thought those were locked away in a vault somewhere.
Even better.
They misfiled the evidence on purpose.
Here, hold the light. I'll get a ladder.
We'll get them down.
Hey, listen to this. Desalvo wrote a poem.
"People everywhere are still in doubt.
Is the strangler in prison or roaming about?"
O'Malley?
Worked with him.
Died of a heart attack at 40.
Fitzgerald -- great cop.
Shot his wife, then himself.
This case... killed a lot of good men, good careers.
Gee, I can't wait to dive in.
Leahy.
I forgot about him. I know where to find him.
Come on. He's a great guy.
W-wait, I-I-I want Maura to look at some of this.
Well, you're gonna have to smuggle it out, then.
You don't need this. Give me this.
Kenny.
Vince Korsak.
Korsak.
Kid, you haven't aged very good.
Oh, you look the same.
Mind if we join you?
This is Detective Rizzoli.
Hello.
Detective, huh?
I heard they was putting girls on the job.
Yeah, they even let us drive our own cars.
I'm familiar with the great work you did on the strangler case.
The Boston Strangler, huh?
Case ruined my life.
Cost me my wife and kid.
They threw me out of homicide.
Detective, what if you were right?
What is Albert Desalvo really wasn't the Boston Strangler,
like you were trying to tell everybody?
It doesn't make much difference what I thought.
But you thought they had the wrong guy.
They did.
And if he's alive, he's still out there.
Detective, wait. Look. You were once a good cop.
I'm a good cop, even though I'm a girl.
I-if you -- if you think of anything, please give us a call.
Good to see you, mac.
Find anything?
Very sophisticated killer.
No forensic evidence so far on either victim.
Uh-oh, uh-oh. Sink. Sink, sink, sink.
Korsak's calling me B.B.K. -- Barf bag kid.
Crowe's leaving plastic puke everywhere.
You're not the first detective to be sickened by death.
You just have to find your morgue legs.
I read a study that said
people can conquer this kind of thing with repeated exposure.
Like when you're afraid of dogs or flying.
Oh. Immersion therapy. Very effective.
It worked for me.
What were you afraid of?
People.
Live ones.
She'll never judge me, tease me.
And I can help her.
I can speak for the dead.
Come here.
Come. Right.
Now we're just gonna --
we're gonna open her up.
We're gonna take a little looknside.
Okay, now breathe deep.
Actually, don't inhale.
Just follow my finger.
Whoa, look at you.
Hey...Jane.
Um...Thank you.
Um...I'll be upstairs.
Well, no, I-I don't want to interrupt.
No, it's okay. I don't want to get in your guys' way.
What?
You'd want to know if you had marfan syndrome, wouldn't you?
You did it again?
I know. I know
Ooh, cobalt blue slingback.
All right, look, come here.
Take a few cuts off of this. It will make you feel better.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.
All right. Let's see it.
All right.
This is an optimum batting stance.
Really, who says? Pee-wee Herman?
It's classic rigid body collision theory,
not Pee-wee Herman.
No, fine.
Fine, fine. You're ruining a national pastime.
What? Don't take my bat.
Let go, let go.
Look what I brought you -- presents.
From the evidence warehouse.
Ooh. I like presents.
What do we have here?
What?
Oh, darn it.
What?
I thought it was an original Mary Quant.
I thought you found something useful.
Well, miniskirts freed women.
They were practical and liberating.
Can you get dna off of it?
No.
No, it -- it's been handled by hundreds of people,
and it wasn't stored properly.
Well, we better come up with something,
Or there are gonna be a lot more women
with bows tied around their necks.
This -- this is Helen Blake.
Okay. All right.
Okay, and after that --
you said I wouldn't make a good detective.
That's not what I say.
All right, look -- we got 294 women
with the same last names as the other 11 victims
and we got to find a way to let them know --
Open it up.
I took a bunch of photos the softball field
and -- and at your second vic's apartment.
And you're always saying that the killer
might try to sightsee in a crowd of ghouls, so..
Thank you. Thank you so much.
All right.
Thanks.
A-aren't you even gonna look at them?
Can't right now. There's a strangler on the loose.
Rizzoli!
Hey, Frankie. .
Hey, come find me later. I need to talk to you.
Sure.
Thanks. Really nice first day.
I got the mayor, the commissioner, every news agency,
hell, I even got my own mother crawling up my ass.
I'm not your leak.
Can't stand the heat,
go back to the drug unit.
Strike two, Rizzoli.
I am working the case!
Really? Let's see.
Oh, I get it -- you're gonna call every Mary Sullivan
in the state of massachusetts and tell her
the boston strangler's looking for her.
Unh-unh. I am setting up a task force.
From now on, everything in this case runs through me.
And I want updates from you every 10 minutes.
Hey, they're towing your car, Rizzoli.
What?
Told you not to park out front.
Hi, sorry. Excuse me.
Come on.
Oh! Did you tow my car?
Only reason I didn't is because of this guy.
Thanks, Big Mo. I owe you one.
Hey, it's good seeing you again. Long time, right?
Next time, I'm taking it, Rizzoli.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
Well, us detectives got to stick together,
'cause the bosses are all idiots, right?
Yes, they are.
What are you doing here?
I, uh -- I asked around after read about the stranglings,
and, uh, well, the word is that you're a good cop.
I thought maybe you could use this.
This is your personal file.
Yeah, can you believe I kept it all these years?
It's always eating at me, too.
You know, we all have that one case,
you know, y-you never really close?
Well, this one is mine.
Thank you for trusting me with it.
Yeah, look, uh...
It ain't easy for an old fart like me
to see a woman doing this job,
but you are a good cop.
How did you know?
Well, I spent 30 years working with a lot of bad ones.
Tell me, uh, you married?
No.
That's too bad.
Uh, no, it's by choice.
Why's that?
Because any man I could love
wouldn't want me doing this job.
And I love this job.
Well, this job can break your heart, too.
Good luck, detective.
"Detective suspended."
Mug shot. Who's this?
See a name?
Yeah. Redmond Jones.
Armed robbery, rape, man-two.
Guy's a dirtbag.
He's been locked up since 1967.
Stabbed a guard, got 40 more years.
And he was paroled last week.
Two days before our first victim was strangled.
Let's contact Leahy.
Redmond Jones. Career criminal.
Aggravated assault, rape, arson -- you name it.
Born bad.
Who is it?
It's the Boston Police, ma'am.
They always come home to their mother.
You worthless, fat-assed, piece-of-crap cop.
I remember you.
It's Redmond's mommy.
Uh, where's your son, ma'am?
Now, why would a skinny, greaseball,
dyke detective be looking for my son?
Ma'am
Oh, holy mother, and all the saints,
they sent in us one of those affirmative-action cops.
What island are you from, honey?
Does he speak english?
Uh, you guys are doing great.
I-I think I'll check around back,
before I strangle the old bitch.
You go. That's right.
Where was Redmond yesterday?
At home, having tea and conversating with his mother.
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Son of a bitch!
Thanks a lot.
Cut it out!
Okay, okay! Calm down!
Are you okay, buddy? Hey, come on, man!
Hey! Come on! That's enough.
The old pig started it 45 years ago!
And I'll finish it, too, you --
What the hell is wrong with you?
You looking to get arrested?
Arrest him.
He's the Boston Strangler.
If they had done it when I told them to,
all those girls would still be alive.
Maybe it's you doing all the killing,
You whiskey-faced mick pig!
I'm the Boston freaking strangler.
I strangled little girls
While I was hooked up to a dialysis machine.
I hope you die nice and slow,
You fat-paddy leprechaun.
Hit me again! I could use a million bucks!
Go to the car! Just go to the car!
Hey, you can't go in there without a warrant.
Sure, I can. It's in plain view.
Now, back off!
Frost.
Isn't that the hubcap that Frankie found?
Hey, nice car. Where is it?
Stolen. The day I got out.
You report it?
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.
Hello, pig.
Maybe you didn't report it because you stole it yourself.
That's right -- kept it perfect for 40 years,
Dumped it in the marina to see if it could swim.
I'll put an APB out on the car.
Yeah, you do that.
You find it, I want it back, you wop pig.
Nice family.
Checked Kenny's alibi.
He's on kidney dialysis four days a week.
Confirmed he was there during the stranglings.
All right.
What are you looking at Kenny for?
You an internal-affairs rat or something?
Oh! Hey, easy.
Why would you make sure a cop has an alibi?
Come on, Vince.
We're just tying up some loose ends, all right?
Got to make sure some jackass named lieutenant Grant
doesn't accuse me of doing shoddy police work.
who is this,
and why is he at all of our crime scenes?
I'll run his face through facial recognition.
Close.
Yeah.
Ah, we have a winner, folks.
Let's check on the web for this guy.
Well, that's the first problem. His mom named him Sandy.
Put this one the wall. Nice website.
Really? You can't bowl or collect ships in a bottle.
You've got to do this for a hobby.
Every detail of the new strangling victims
is on this guy's blog.
Boston police. Open up.
Clear.
Get up! Stand up! Get up! Hands all the way up!
Up against the wall!
Get on the bed!
Oh, we got a live one.
I'm curious why you at the crime scenes?
You like strangling, Sandy?
My name's Dr. K, yo.
Me and Dr. Kevorkian are death enthusiasts.
Ain't nothing illegal about that.
Interference with a police officer during performance of duty is.
Hey, if I confess,
can I look at the bodies you got in the morgue?
Rizzoli, we've got a third victim.
Liver temp indicates she died within the last hour.
So it's not our "Death enthusiast."
Well, at least he's not blogging.
Thanks for pointing out the bright side.
Researchers at the university of Pittsburgh
have proven that optimistic people live longer.
So she was a pessimist?
Joanne Graff -- 29.
A Joanne Graff was strangled in 1962...
By the Boston strangler.
Maura.
What do you see?
A reddish-brown stain.
In other words, blood.
No, a reddish-brownish stain.
The crime lab will determine what it is.
No signs of lacerations or abrasions on the victim.
so it's not hers,
which means we might have gotten lucky
and the killer was bleeding.
or smearing reddish-brownish stuff.
Thanks.
Red's car has been located.
Towing it to evidence now.
See?
You just got to remain optimistic.
Hey, move that to evidence!
You can't park there, Rizzoli.
Move that to an evidence bay.
I can't. They're all full.
Oh, really?
You're just gonna keep your car parked right there, huh?
Me and the batmobile, we're gonna stay right here.
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on, damn it! Stop!
You got your evidence, Rizzoli.
Damn it!
Not now, maura. I'm in a bad mood.
What?
Maura, what's up?
Great news --
we got hit on the blood you found on the second victim's blouse.
Who does it belong to?
Redmond Jones.
Guys, I think we just found the Boston strangler.
We should let Lieutenant Grant know.
Let's bring this sucker home.
Rizzoli, hey.
The task force will take it from here.
Y-you can't do that. It's my case.
Well, you're part of the task force.
Come along if you like.
Yeah. Come along. It'll be fun.
He asked me, Janie.
You're squeezing the orange, huh, Frankie?
You getting some juice?
That's a fast way to make detective.
Grant put me on the task force.
What do you want me to do? Say no?
Yeah, Frankie!
Mom?
Dad? Hi, daddy.
Janie, you okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi.
What are you doing here?
What do you mean, what am I doing here?
Frankie said they towed your car away and you needed a lift.
Hey, he's gonna make his first big arrest, you know.
Yeah, I know. That's great. That's great.
I know.
Listen, um, daddy how come you never asked me
to be a part of Rizzoli and Sons?
Well, now you want to be a plumber?
No -- no, I just -- I don't understand
why all of a sudden you want Frankie
to take over the family business.
Frankie Jr.?!
You two kids were never interested in the business.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
All right, I'll see you at home.
Okay.
All right, guys, way to go!
I heard. I'm sorry.
You should have seen him, Grant and his task force,
Everybody celebrating -- it was a joke.
Just -- we get one body dropped in our laps.
We have two stranglings in one day.
We have no forensic evidence, and then -- bam!
We find blood
Maura says forensic evidence doesn't waver,
doesn't lie, doesn't change its mind.
Hey, Frost,
Did Redmond Jones have any blood work done recently,
any doctor visits?
No, not that I could find.
I'm gonna check something.
He's sharing a cell with this guy Redmond Jones.
Well, Redmond Jones tells him the whole story,
all these girls that he strangled.
Desalvo's such a nutcake,
He begins telling people it's him,
The Boston Strangler's him.
Excuse me. Detective Leahy?
Oh, hey. You're, uh, dr. Isles.
I am. It's -- it's nice to meet you.
How are you?
Do you have a minute?
Why? What's up, doc?
Go to the one on Boylston street,
across from the Common.
There's a dialysis center there.
Yesterday, 2:00.
I checked the clearance records,
showed Kenny's photo around. The alibi's solid.
I can't explain it. It's a gut thing.
Understood.
Freeze. Blow that up.
There he is going in.
Shuttle forward.
Stop. Blow that up.
Five minutes later. How long does dialysis take?
Couple hours.
That is a good alibi.
How many dialysis appointments have you missed?
None.
Every other day, I'm in dialysis for hours.
I don't think that's possible.
You're exhibiting signs of renal failure.
I'm gonna go call your doctor.
Hey, doc.
What are you doing?
You can't stop talking, can you?
You know why you did it, detective?
Yeah, I was in a bad mood, okay?
You have an obsession disorder.
You identified with the aggressor,
The Boston Strangler, and you became him.
Shut up. Just -- -'cause I can get help --
Shut up!
The real killer is Redmond Jones. You understand?
Redmond Jones is the Boston Strangler.
He's getting what he should have gotten 40 years ago.
I made sure of that.
By murdering three more women and framing him.
Hey, Maura.
Check it out. Can you run this...
blood.
You are a good cop.
For a girl.
All right, your gun -- put it down. Kick it over there.
Don't do it, Jane.
Oh, shut the hell up!
Put the gun down.
Put it down. Slow.
All right, now kick it over there.
You planted Redmond Jones' blood, didn't you?
I still got some.
Home run.
No. Just a base hit.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, did you ever talk to Marfan man?
Mm-hmm. He called to thank me.
He found a specialist --
An international expert, actually.
Really? Are you gonna see him again?
I don't date patients.
You don't want to go out with him
'cause he's got some weird-ass disease.
His limbs are a little spidery.
Come on. But that is not the only reason.
Come on. You got to stop that.
You got to stop diagnosing people.
Can we just talk about your love life.
Okay.
Um...I date two kinds --
The kind that hates that I'm a cop.
And the kind that wants me to use the handcuffs.
Okay, watch this. Ready?
3, 2, 1.
Shabow.
See ya.
That was fast.
"I'm smiling. I like handcfs."
All right.
See?
So...Who do you think the original Boston Strangler was?
I don't think we'll ever know.
Good job, Rizzoli.
While Kenny was trying to kill Dr. Oz over here,
I was looking for you so you could have that arrest, too.
I owe you a massive apology.
And...I'm sorry.
Yeah, I can tell from the nasty face you're making.
Oh, that's not because of you, Jane.
He has bullous lesions.
I have what?
Blisters.
How did you know that?
You were limping.
Right. I was limping. Can I sit down?
No.
Yes.
We didn't have to wear big-boy shoes in the drug unit.
You're not gonna take those off in here?
No. I'm not.
Well, I can take a look at your bullous lesions if you would like me to.
Maura, come on!
I'm just saying.
Anyway, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
We got off to such a bad start on our first case.
And I wasn't cheating off you on our catechism test.
I saw you looking at it.
You saw me looking,
But I wasn't looking at your paper.
See you soon.
Bye. See ya.
