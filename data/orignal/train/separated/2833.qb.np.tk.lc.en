what the hell is that ? !
what the hell is that ? is that you ?
you &apos;re really not a morning person .
just back off !
get up ! get up ! get up !
what is that noise ?
you !
it &apos;s the chick .
she &apos;s going through some changes .
what kind of changes ?
the vet seems to think ...
... she &apos;s becoming a rooster .
we &apos;re getting a second opinion .
the one with the embryos
why are you shopping at 8 in the morning ?
i &apos;ve been up since 6 ...
... thanks to somebody &apos;s dumb @-@ ass rooster .
you should get rid of those animals . they shouldn &apos;t be in an apartment .
especially not with these knives and cookbooks around .
i &apos;m going to the doctor and see if i &apos;m ready ...
... to have frank
and alice &apos;s embryo
transferred into my uterus .
how will they know ?
they &apos;ll just see if my endometrial layer is thick .
i can check that for you .
okay , think &quot; thick . &quot;
good luck !
wish me luck .
good luck .
i &apos;m still right .
that is so not true .
what ? i know it &apos;s her laundry day ...
... and that means she &apos;s wearing her old @-@ lady underpants .
i can check that for you .
you two think you know me and rachel ... better than we know you .
well , we do .
you can only eat tic tacs in even numbers .
what &apos;s that about ?
and you !
ross , if you check rachel &apos;s bag ...
... you &apos;ll find a half @-@ eaten box of cookies in there .
you &apos;re good .
these are not .
i &apos;m so not impressed . everybody snacks when they shop .
ross , how many items left in that bag ?
five .
okay , 10 bucks says we can name every item in that bag .
how many guesses ?
six .
challenge extended .
deal !
challenge accepted .
all right , we &apos;ll start with .. apples
we &apos;ll be starting with apples .
stop that now .
yes .
okay . tortilla chips .
yogurt .
diet soda .
yes ...
orange juice .
there &apos;s no orange juice ! we win !
they have another guess .
well , we won that one .
okay . the last thing is
not for another two weeks .
i got it .
scotch ...
... tape .
how did you know she would buy scotch tape ?
we used up theirs last night making scary faces .
oh , man !
all right ! ten bucks . fork it over.cough it up . pay the piper .
give me it !
you don &apos;t know us better . i want a rematch .
and no stupid grocery questions . real , personal questions .
and the winner gets $ 100 .
serious ?
are you scared ?
no .
who makes up the questions ?
ross will do it .
sure , ross will do it .
it &apos;s not like he has a job or a child or a life of his own .
fine . we &apos;ll ask phoebe .
no , i want to play .
looks like your uterus is ready for implantation .
i knew it ! i felt really thick this morning .
okay , so what &apos;s now ? go get the eggs . put them in there .
it &apos;ll take a little while to prepare the embryos .
embryos ? as in more than one ?
five , actually .
five ? okay , where am i giving birth , a hospital or a big box under the stairs ?
doing five gives you a 25 % chance that at least one will attach .
that &apos;s it ? 25 % ?
that means that it &apos;s , like , 75 % chance of no baby at all ?
i was thinking , what are the odds ... if you stuff 200 of them in there ?
sweetie , now ... she &apos;s a woman , not a gumball machine .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll do this as many times as it takes to get it right .
the thing is , we kind of only have one shot .
it costs $ 16,000 each time you do this .
sixteen thousand dollars ? ! well , it &apos;s 20 in california .
we &apos;re kind of using all the money we have to do it this one time .
okay , that &apos;s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus .
maybe there &apos;s something i can do to make sure i get pregnant .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
wow , you guys really don &apos;t know anything .
why don &apos;t you get drunk ?
it worked for a bunch of girls in my high school .
so how &apos;s the test coming ?
hey , you &apos;re touching the game board .
sorry .
you freak .
do you realize that any minute now ... phoebe could be pregnant ?
i know , i know .
it &apos;s such a huge , life @-@ altering thing .
the test is ready .
okay . each team will answer 10 questions.the first team to answer the most questions wins .
the categories are &quot; fears and pet peeves ... &quot;
