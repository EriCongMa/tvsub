like , we really , we really shouldn &apos;t meet like this .
i know .
but , uh , we gotta talk about some things .
everyone , this is our new section chief .
this is agent mateo cruz .
you could have mentioned this .
i got word minutes after we had breakfast .
cruz has risen through the ranks .
you ever heard of this cruz guy ?
yeah , i &apos;ve heard his name .
every time your name was mentioned today
and every time i didn &apos;t say ,
hey , yeah , i know him , i &apos;m lying .
that case could stay open for a couple of years .
it &apos;s already been almost 3 .
can &apos;t we just say we &apos;re on assignment ?
no one can know .
拨号中
if i were you ,
i would save my strength .
2010年10月
chief strauss .
agent jareau .
welcome .
i &apos;ve been ordered to brief you on your new assignment .
you &apos;ll be splitting time between here and d.c.
so i haven &apos;t been drafted ?
your transfer to state was a necessary backstop .
this mission is code word classified .
even the personnel reporting to you
will not know the nature of your work .
you need to change .
you just lost us a valuable asset .
me ? that terrorist got hurt trying to escape .
you were right .
he talked ?
yeah , well , he started to , and then this .
agent jareau , this is mateo cruz .
he &apos;s heading up the taskforce .
all right , follow me .
hastings , do you have a minute ?
was this man tortured to death ?
this man is al @-@ qaeda operative savin mubari .
he was one of bin laden &apos;s couriers , and , yes , he was .
didn &apos;t anyone tell you to get changed ?
hastings , why don &apos;t you say
hello to ssa jennifer jareau from the bau .
she &apos;ll be handling female interrogations .
we don &apos;t need a profile if we know we &apos;re looking for bin laden .
i &apos;m not a profiler .
i was the communications liaison .
hell , then why is she even here ?
stand down . jareau is a proven mediator .
don &apos;t get comfortable . this places changes people .
i can &apos;t imagine what it &apos;ll do to someone like you .
arrogance aside , hastings is cia elite , so ...
how can you say that ?
he just tortured a man to death .
the bureau and the cia handle things differently , but ...
hastings didn &apos;t do this .
who &apos;s the woman ?
that &apos;s nadia , mubari &apos;s wife .
does she know anything ?
it &apos;s up to you to find out .
agent jareau ,
this is tivon askari , our interpreter .
you &apos;ll be working closely with him on this assignment .
very nice to meet you .
jj &apos;s cell still hasn &apos;t shown up .
i &apos;m telling you , hotch , she &apos;s in trouble .
garcia &apos;s tracking her car now .
agent sharp , will you take agent jareau &apos;s son to my office ?
it &apos;s an emergency .
yes , sir .
thank you .
you go with her , love .
i found it . it &apos;s on the south side of the street .
they &apos;re here .
i &apos;ll let you know .
jj &apos;s car parked on constitution .
morgan and reid are on their way .
find matt cruz . he &apos;ll know what &apos;s going on .
section chief matt cruz ?
grant , it &apos;s garcia .
i need to speak to matt cruz .
that &apos;s why i couldn &apos;t tell you on the phone .
jj made me promise .
yeah , i know what time it is . get him now .
well , she was afraid someone was listening ,
but what does cruz have to do with jj &apos;s disappearance ?
they worked together at the state department .
neither one has mentioned that .
they couldn &apos;t . their assignment was classified .
no , past tense .
jj worked at the state department years ago .
i thought that , too ,
until cruz was assigned here
and the secret calls and texts started again .
look , all i know is , is jj said if anything every happened to her
that cruz would know what to do .
sir , there &apos;s a problem .
chief cruz isn &apos;t answering
and gps on his mobile isn &apos;t transmitting .
that &apos;s the same thing as jj .
garcia , have rossi and blake check out cruz &apos;s house ,
and , anderson , put agent jareau &apos;s family in protective custody .
this is ssa hotchner with the bau .
i need to speak to the director .
they &apos;re trying to access integrity !
we can &apos;t let them get our codes !
you have forgotten .
i know exactly how to get what i want .
&quot; why should we look to the past
in order to prepare for the future ?
because there is nowhere else to look . &quot;
james burke .
the director &apos;s behind closed doors
with the under secretary of arms control and international security affairs .
hotch is on his way to the state department to get some answers .
we found jj &apos;s cell phone , but there wasn &apos;t any sign of her .
cruz is missing , too .
his car is still in his garage , but mail and newspapers
suggest that he &apos;s been gone at least 24 hours .
i &apos;m trying .
i &apos;m trying--i &apos;m trying to pull data off of jj &apos;s phone ,
but it &apos;s like level 9 security .
it would make snowden weep .
what about cell phone records ?
encrypted . jj &apos;s and cruz &apos;s .
that &apos;s not surprising if they work for the state department .
but if that assignment was a backstop ,
then jj &apos;s transfer as d.o.d. liaison was her cover .
so what was she really doing that year ?
that &apos;s the first question hotch is gonna ask .
strauss was pressured by the executive branch
to push jj &apos;s transfer through in 2010,
so she would have known the reason why .
any assignment strauss authorized
would be archived in the scif .
that facility is code word classified .
ok , but anderson can get you in .
he archives those reports .
blake , rossi , jj couldn &apos;t have used the scif
without drawing attention .
she probably has it foxholed right here in the bau .
we just need to find it .
and what are you not telling us ?
whoever took cruz and jj is highly trained and highly organized .
justice , defense , and state--
they wouldn &apos;t be on edge like this
if this was a simple matter of two missing agents .
is hotch worried that the recovery won &apos;t be made a priority ?
it &apos;s our job to find the leverage that assures it is .
let &apos;s get it done .
the sooner you give me the security codes ,
the sooner this can end .
say yes if you understand .
what the hell is going on ?
she just went crazy on me . i don &apos;t know where it came from .
where &apos;s the doll ?
what doll ?
the doll . we need to find the doll .
it &apos;s ok . calm down .
where is the doll ?
it was on the ground outside .
translate , please .
me ?
that was your first step at developing rapport .
we need to build on that .
my name is jennifer .
this is michael .
was that your child &apos;s ?
where is she ?
quetta .
she &apos;s in pakistan .
ok , uh , tell her if she gives us the names
of the men that dealt with her husband ,
we &apos;ll reunite her with her daughter .
we can &apos;t tell her that .
ok , we can , but we can &apos;t actually do it .
jareau ...
you understand , we can &apos;t launch a mission
to rescue one prisoner &apos;s daughter . right ?
most of the files are kept on hard copy
to prevent digital espionage .
ok . good thing one of us reads 20,000 words per minute .
time to get my spy face on .
this has to be jj &apos;s foxhole .
it was her office when she was liaison .
hotch handles most of the paperwork now ,
but before jj was a profiler ,
she reviewed cases in here .
well , she wouldn &apos;t hide anything too far out of reach .
all right , 4 digits . any ideas ?
henry &apos;s birthday is november 12 .
1112 .
that &apos;s too easy .
try 2008 , the year she became a mom .
yep .
what &apos;s integrity ?
i don &apos;t know .
but someone does .
华盛顿特区
agent hotchner ,
we told you we were handling this .
yes , madame secretary .
i thought it would be a good idea if we shared information .
tell us what you know .
well , it might save time if you told me
the true nature of agent jareau &apos;s reassignment in 2010 .
she was d.o.d. liaison to the state department ,
but you already know that .
i know that that was her backstop .
i &apos;m referring to something called &quot; integrity . &quot;
clear the room , please .
&quot; integrity . &quot;
garcia , cross @-@ reference keyword &quot; integrity &quot;
against middle east operations dating back to 2010 .
focus specifically on military action
taken against osama bin laden and / or al @-@ qaeda .
now we &apos;re talkin &apos; .
what did you find ?
a ghost file in a ghost folder
on a ghost server that nobody wants me to know about .
i &apos;ll have to resurrect some gigabytes .
so agent jareau was on a taskforce to find bin laden
and integrity was the name of the operation ?
no .
integrity &apos;s the name of a database born out of that mission .
a failsafe put in place
to protect covert agents and operations .
you shouldn &apos;t even know it exists .
but agent jareau and agent cruz know ,
and that &apos;s why they &apos;ve been taken .
we believe so .
both have the necessary codes to access the system .
reid .
why was jj in the middle east ?
and what were cruz and strauss doing there ?
but she &apos;s already given us the names of two high @-@ level terrorists .
to assure her family &apos;s safety ,
she &apos;ll be even more willing to cooperate .
we can &apos;t risk u.s. casualties
trying to save a terrorist &apos;s daughter .
well , she was married to one ,
but nadia is a mother first .
look , she &apos;s clutching that doll
as if her life depends on it .
we put her daughter in her arms instead ,
she &apos;ll tell us everything .
agent jareau has a valid point .
the child &apos;s definitely her achilles heel .
what if she &apos;s already given us everything ?
two terrorists her husband knew , ok .
but neither provided tangible leads to obl .
she could be stalling .
and what if she &apos;s not ?
what if she has one more name
that gets us bin laden ?
well , that &apos;s a risk worth taking .
ok , i &apos;ll contact secretary jackson .
all right , our fourth person is michael hastings ,
cia operative ,
killed in action april 24 , 2011 .
operation classified .
this isn &apos;t right .
the u.s. doesn &apos;t commemorate clandestine operations .
these are surveillance images .
so who took them ?
the same person who killed hastings .
let &apos;s hope hotch can find out who that was .
there are ongoing back channel negotiations we can &apos;t disrupt .
so agents jareau and cruz get written off ?
i know they &apos;re your team ,
but they &apos;re not your problem .
who killed agent hastings ?
he was a senior member of the taskforce you assembled .
his name is tivon askari ,
former iraqi special forces .
a turned interrogator , askari aided in debriefing informants .
he was our lead translator
until an attack on the taskforce
exposed him as a traitor .
following the attack , jareau and cruz
uncovered among his belongings
surveillance images and detailed intelligence
on our own people .
where is he now ?
askari went to ground ,
we &apos;ve been looking for him ever since .
well , he wouldn &apos;t have resurfaced without a reason .
he knows how valuable access to something like integrity
would be to our enemies ,
and if you have no idea where he is ,
then agents cruz and jareau
are running out of time .
what you need to do ,
agent , is stand down .
we are handling this .
this needs to be managed a little more delicately
than by the coarse hands of the bau .
what that means ,
no more scif break @-@ ins .
no more database searches .
go back to chasing serial killers .
this is a state matter .
yeah .
they just locked us out .
is state doing anything to find jj and cruz ?
no .
so what are we gonna do ?
we call in reinforcements .
this is prentiss .
hotch , what &apos;s wrong ?
debrief me on the plane . i &apos;m on my way .
soon .
extraction team is on approach .
they should have nadia &apos;s daughter momentarily .
helo &apos;s on the ground .
roger , team 3 , we are picking up activity in sector 9 .
extraction &apos;s in place . go , go , go !
we &apos;ve got a family .
two adults , one child .
can you confirm their identities ?
it &apos;s the target . we have the girl .
proceed with extraction .
we &apos;re taking fire !
take cover .
pull out of there . pull out of there now !
pull out !
that was an explosion .
all right , get them back on line .
get them back on the line .
team 3 ...
team 3 . this is overwatch alpha . come in . over .
team 3 , report .
team 3 , this is overwatch alpha . report .
according to interpol data ,
askari is as bad as they get .
highly educated member of the republican guard
caught torturing pows off the clock for fun .
i &apos;m sending you his profile now .
so this is who has jj ?
his name speaks volumes .
tivon means &quot; student of nature , &quot;
yet askari means soldier .
askari &apos;s methods appear well documented .
he &apos;s organized , he &apos;s meticulous .
he typically spends 24 hours with his subjects before they break .
they &apos;ve had cruz at least that long .
it looks like this guy
uses most of the standard torture techniques .
he even keeps his ritual to an established timeline ,
a so @-@ called perfect methodology
evolved through years of practice .
no sexual torture .
maybe he has lines he doesn &apos;t cross .
typically , professional torturers are driven
by a false sense of moral superiority .
they don &apos;t derive sexual pleasure from the cruelty they inflict .
but askari isn &apos;t just a torturer .
he &apos;s a sadistic serial killer .
and they love getting off .
guys , i may have two more victims we can attribute to askari .
savin mubari and his wife nadia .
he was a known confidant to bin laden &apos;s .
both were at the camp where jj worked .
then jj would have been assigned to interrogate nadia .
do we know what happened to her ?
m.o. matches all of askari &apos;s victims except for one thing .
she was raped .
so what was different about her ?
maybe she lasted the longest .
if his ritual dictates a specific timeline ,
any new aspect would fall later in his routine .
so the longer jj holds out ,
the greater the likelihood that &apos;ll happen to her .
so how much time does jj have ?
a few hours .
no , no , no , what are you doing ?
it &apos;s ok .
you son of a bitch !
it &apos;s ok .
you have 5 seconds to give me what i want .
5 ...
4 ...
you kill him , your plan is ruined !
3
stop counting !
2
please !
1 ...
no .
no !
let her down .
you don &apos;t have to come .
we know .
this is gonna destroy her .
it isn &apos;t your fault .
like hell .
i was the one who said we should go get her daughter .
nadia ?
nadia ?
when war broke out , it looks like askari &apos;s talents
were recruited by the regime to break potential informants
as well as captured u.s. troops .
so askari works for the highest bidder .
how does a guy who tortured u.s. soldiers
get drafted to our side ?
wait , i might know that .
i uploaded that ghost file
to my private cloud server .
the order was given by chief cruz .
why would cruz enlist a man like askari ?
he needed a high @-@ ranking partner to put him in position .
so what are we saying , cruz and askari were working together ?
then jj &apos;s in more danger than we thought .
hey . welcome back .
how was your trip home ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
nothing &apos;s wrong . i &apos;m pregnant .
is that a good thing ?
yeah .
yeah , will and i have been trying .
it &apos;s just ...
i never imagined finding out about it here .
well , then ...
congratulations .
jareau .
there &apos;s a call for you from bau .
some kind of emergency involving emily ?
who &apos;s emily ?
jj .
god , you &apos;re freezing .
emily .
how did you find me ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s taking everything .
i can &apos;t ...
i think i might break .
you have to break .
no , i ...
this has to end .
matt ...
how did you--
i thought you-- i thought you were dead .
i know . they &apos;re trying to break you .
i ... i must be seeing things .
you have to break .
you can &apos;t take much more of this .
no ...
the time has come to give up your security codes .
no ...
cruz never officially put his name in for section chief .
well , somebody did .
or he pulled strings , called in favors to get closer to jj .
emily , you saw jj during this time .
did she ever mention cruz or details of the investigation ?
the first thing i &apos;m doing
when we get to paris is having this removed .
how could a brand hurt more than getting staked ?
maybe it &apos;s a psychosomatic itch you &apos;re scratching ?
the brand left an emotional toll ,
doyle established dominance over you
by marking you as his .
a stake--i mean you overcame death .
the ultimate victory over your foe .
why suffer a pain you &apos;re proud of ?
or you could always get another tattoo .
yeah , something transformative , like a ...
a phoenix .
or a blackbird .
i love the song .
but something tells me i shouldn &apos;t tread in your waters .
come on , jj . something &apos;s obviously different about you .
you commandeered an interpol jet .
you &apos;re profiling me .
why didn &apos;t you say your transfer was a backstop ?
oh , i know that look .
the &quot; i can &apos;t trust anyone but myself &quot; look . i invented it .
do you ever feel like you &apos;re in way over your head ?
i got assigned to an information hunt .
instead , i am chasing an unsub who killed my informant .
what would hotch tell you to do ?
focus on victimology , let behavior lead the way .
exactly .
who did your unsub kill ?
the one person i was getting through to .
why ?
because i was getting through to ...
i was getting through to her .
what if she was about to expose her killer ?
someone on the inside ?
it sounds like it &apos;s time for you to be the blackbird and flip the script .
jj suspected a double agent .
she could have been talking about cruz .
if cruz is working with askari , why take jj ?
his clearance level is higher than hers .
at interpol , our most sensitive information
requires two ranking agents to gain access .
maybe the integrity systems require the same .
but when agents are compromised ,
their security privileges are revoked .
jj &apos;s codes shouldn &apos;t work .
if he knew what he was doing ,
he could reroute the system updates
that would render their security codes useless .
where would he have to do to do that ?
straight to the source .
he &apos;d have to hard @-@ line into the servers ,
but they &apos;re scattered all over the country .
it would be difficult to transport jj
and keep to askari &apos;s timeline .
he must have taken her someplace local .
we need to figure out which server they &apos;ve hacked .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
请求文件 : 诚信
codes confirmed . now we just need the second user .
i guess we don &apos;t need you anymore .
you hurt her , you &apos;ll never get my codes .
ever .
welcome back .
thank you .
we &apos;re getting nowhere on your inside man theory .
it &apos;s because we &apos;ve been looking in the wrong place .
where should we be looking ?
ops .
you think the double agent &apos;s one of us ?
it would be the perfect infiltration plan .
it &apos;s the only way the extraction of nadia &apos;s daughter
would have been compromised .
the mission was need to know .
what are you proposing ?
i &apos;m not proposing anything .
we &apos;ve been authorized to use an off @-@ base location
for enhanced interrogation of our own people .
i can &apos;t believe strauss signed off on this .
she didn &apos;t .
jackson did .
you went over strauss ?
i didn &apos;t think you had it in you .
too many people have died for us .
hastings !
fall back !
what have you got , garcia ?
i found the relevant servers .
how many were there ?
d.c. area , 6 .
we need to narrow it down .
we can ping the servers to see who &apos;s hard @-@ lined in .
but the second we start knocking ,
fbi data security is gonna know .
it &apos;s not gonna be a big leap to figure out why we &apos;re doing this .
we won &apos;t be here when they do .
ok . i &apos;m going in .
it &apos;s not working . none of the servers are showing any active hard @-@ lines .
then we &apos;re back to square one .
no , no . we don &apos;t have time for that .
it &apos;s already been 24 hours .
jj &apos;s beaming out of one of the sites .
we &apos;ll work our way down the list .
ok , sir , i &apos;m sending coordinates now .
what happened ?
the convoy was attacked .
hastings ?
taken , by askari &apos;s men .
there &apos;s something else .
no .
no ... no .
i &apos;m so sorry .
your code now ,
or this time she loses more than her baby .
go to hell .
your code !
did you tell him i was pregnant ?
of course not .
i never told anyone .
ok .
it &apos;s enough .
come out .
who are you talking to ?
not to you , to your boss .
come out and face me , you coward .
here , try this .
tea ? i &apos;m not drinking tea . jj &apos;s not drinking tea .
you need to calm down .
it &apos;s been 24 hours , kevin .
do you know what happens after 24 hours ? because i do .
what was that ?
blackbird .
what does that mean ?
i have no idea .
it &apos;s jj .
how did you know ?
askari couldn &apos;t possibly know that i was pregnant .
i didn &apos;t tell anyone , not even my husband .
i only told matt ,
right before you came and gave me that message from the bau .
how long were you listening before you approached ?
the humvee attack proved
i was right about an inside man .
and look what it cost you .
you can threaten to kill me .
that won &apos;t give you what you want .
she &apos;s right .
don &apos;t i know it .
but i also know you , matt .
and what line you won &apos;t let me cross .
jareau is your achilles heel .
and i don &apos;t blame you .
she is an attractive woman .
don &apos;t touch her , you sick son of a bitch !
no more games .
i want integrity .
she &apos;s the price .
no . no .
maybe ...
i can make you one .
another one .
jj must have logged in with a panic sequence
that triggered a silent alarm .
it &apos;s pretty standard protocol .
enter your security codes backwards
and a preset alarm is activated ,
in this case , blackbird .
oh , god , jj sent that alert 30 minutes ago .
they must have looped the system .
that &apos;s why i couldn &apos;t read any hard @-@ lines .
which of the servers send the message ?
hands where we can see them .
what--what--whoa , whoa . whoa .
utherlay oadchurchbray .
utherlay oadchurchbray .
you don &apos;t need to be a linguist to recognize pig latin .
luther and broadchurch is the location of cramer industries .
it &apos;s a research and development company .
r and d -- that &apos;s gotta be a front for clandestine operations .
hang on .
take your time , matt . i &apos;ve been thinking about this for years .
matt , don &apos;t .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine .
ok , ok , that &apos;s it . just stop !
i &apos;ll do it . just stop .
where &apos;s the server mainframe ?
subterranean level .
which way is that ?
through the warehouse .
show us .
we &apos;re in .
it worked .
start with base security protocols and covert deployments .
now that we have access ...
i &apos;ll call for helo extraction .
tell the men to meet me upstairs .
you know what to do .
we don &apos;t have it all .
we have enough .
it &apos;s hastings . i don &apos;t see askari .
hastings !
stop ! no !
thank you , matt .
matt ...
no ...
no .
emily .
i knew they &apos;d call you .
i knew it .
all right . shh ...
are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine . help matt , please .
hastings is headed to the roof .
you have to stop him .
comms aren &apos;t working down here .
he &apos;s lost a lot of blood . how &apos;s jj ?
she &apos;s standing , but that &apos;s --
where the hell did she go ?
she went to get hastings .
it &apos;s personal for her .
go help her . i &apos;ve got him .
come on . come on .
he &apos;s headed to the roof !
so is jj .
i got you !
can you give us a minute , please ?
matt , what you did ...
i had your back .
always did .
thank you .
jennifer ...
get some rest .
nietzsche said , &quot; when you look long into an abyss ...
the abyss looks into you . &quot;
emily , how much longer do we have you ?
um ... 6 hours .
it &apos;s too soon .
it &apos;s more than we had yesterday .
i &apos;m just glad i finally got to meet you .
i &apos;ve heard such amazing things .
all lies .
no . no more lies .
nothing but the truth from now on .
oh , yeah ?
