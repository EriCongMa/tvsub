the cure to vampirism .
you &apos;re gonna take the cure , elena .
and i &apos;m gonna take it with you .
it &apos;s not healing .
it worked .
the smallest chance at the perfect life with you
is infinitely better than an immortal one without you .
i made a list of all the things that
i &apos;ve done since i fell for you .
because you &apos;re a control freak who &apos;s lost control .
that &apos;s what falling for somebody is .
control is all i have ,
and i don &apos;t think that i can give that up .
bonnie !
before the 1900s , lily fell in
with a group of witches that were cast out
of the gemini coven .
vampires with witch power .
they can never be allowed to escape .
it &apos;s time we get the hell out of this place .
welcome to the wedding of alaric saltzman
and josette laughlin .
oh , god .
no .
miss me ?
what are you doing ?
waiting for you .
on the ground where we first met ?
i &apos;m feeling symbolic .
it &apos;s bad , isn &apos;t it ?
i believe you owe me a dance , miss gilbert .
damon , just tell me .
how bad is it ?
dance with me , please , elena .
elena !
come on . hey . wake up .
elena .
oh , god .
help .
somebody , please help me .
kai !
come on . just drink .
no . no .
stefan . stefan !
she won &apos;t wake up .
oh , my god .
she won &apos;t wake up . i don &apos;t understand .
just get her to the hospital now .
yeah .
she &apos;s human . what if she doesn &apos;t--
nothing personal , but this is a family matter now .
let me guess . prison world ?
i mean , you can &apos;t kill me ,
or else you all die , too , right ?
i &apos;m sorry about your twinsies .
i just don &apos;t feel like competing for leadership
with future gemini twins .
see ...
when your family decides
that you &apos;re nothing but an irredeemable piece of trash ,
well ...
guess the best thing to do is prove them right , right ?
this ought to do it .
no !
you &apos;re going easy on me .
come on .
this is supposed to be a special moment .
yeah . no . i can &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t do that .
don &apos;t give up like that .
why not ?
i have nothing left to fight for .
damon !
bonnie bennett .
you have no idea how good it is to hear your voice right now .
damon , kai &apos;s out .
i know . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re safe .
i was worried kai already got to you .
he did , and i don &apos;t know how , but i &apos;m still alive .
he drained my blood , and that &apos;s all .
that &apos;s not all .
he was at the wedding .
jo &apos;s dead . he killed her .
oh , my god .
and elena got knocked out , and she &apos;s not waking up .
the doctors keep telling me
there &apos;s nothing physically wrong with her .
i don &apos;t know what to do , bon .
stay there , ok ? i &apos;m coming .
good . you &apos;re up .
sorry to be indecorous ,
but you were both solidly unconscious
when i pulled you from the wedding mayhem .
where are we going ? elena !
elena is in the hospital with damon .
kai is dead ,
and all the geminis are going down with him ,
and i grabbed the two of you to help me deal with a bigger problem .
there &apos;s a bigger problem ? !
valerie , malcolm ?
get in the car , please .
1702 route 12 .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s where we are , right ?
i mean , i read the map very carefully .
he--he said they would be here .
they &apos;re probably scared out of their minds .
who are you talking about ?
my friends .
kai brought them back when he escaped that prison .
they &apos;re here somewhere .
he lied to you . there &apos;s nobody out he .
you made a deal with a sociopath ,
and now a lot of people are dead .
you &apos;re wasting your time !
where &apos;s my daughter ?
liv !
liv !
oh , tyler !
oh , god , no .
this can &apos;t be happening .
oh , god .
what &apos;s happening to me ?
kai &apos;s dead , liv .
i heard the screams .
your dad , your coven , they &apos;re all in there ,
dying , which means--
no . no . no .
i love you , liv .
you need to know that
if this has to be it for us .
no . you &apos;re not dying ,
liv .
not after everything .
you &apos;re not dying , tyler .
it &apos;s a full moon .
if you turn , it will heal you .
you have to .
no . i &apos;m not triggering it .
you once told me
that i gave you a second chance ,
and you promised me that you wouldn &apos;t waste it .
i love you .
let me do this for you .
don &apos;t waste it .
i love you .
nooo !
come on . answer .
answer damn it .
ty ?
matt , listen to me .
you have to tell every ...
ty , what &apos;s wrong ?
i triggered my curse .
no .
tell every vampire to steer clear of me .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be able to control who i go after ,
and my bite will kill them .
let me guess-- not there either .
did you come all this way to mock me ?
no . i came here to put you back in your cell where you belong .
do i look like a ripper , stefan ?
i &apos;ve said repeatedly that the hope of being reunited with my family
is enough to overcome the urges .
would you please just stop it with the word family ?
they &apos;re just a bunch of random people that you happened to sire .
we spent a century and a half together .
we &apos;re loyal to each other .
our relationship is a deeper bond than i have ever known .
what other word would i use ?
lily , you either come with me right now ,
or you &apos;re out of my life .
do you understand me ?
your son .
i &apos;m sorry .
malcolm , are you here , sweetheart ?
what did you give kai ?
i thought you were leaving .
tell me what you gave kai in return for your family .
i gave him my blood .
vodux .
here &apos;s to being different , dad .
bad time ?
freaky , right ?
i turned myself into one of lily &apos;s heretics .
it &apos;s really incredible actually .
i can literally siphon the magic of my vampirism
and convert it into more magic .
looks like somebody &apos;s having a very bad day .
motus !
bad doggie .
here . say it .
no . i &apos;m not doing this .
fine . i &apos;ll say it .
here lies elena gilbert ,
a fun girlfriend and an amazing friend .
i &apos;m glad one of us can find humor in this .
i have to find humor in this , matt ,
because the alternative ...
the alternative would be to say good @-@ bye ,
and i &apos;m just--
i &apos;m not ready for that yet .
bonnie , let &apos;s go . we got to get to the hospital .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what is that ?
i found it in the kitchen .
all this time travel &apos;s been hard on the camera , bon .
there it is .
you saw the post @-@ it !
this message will self @-@ destruct in 10 seconds .
kidding . anyhoo , you &apos;re probably wondering why you &apos;re still alive
since i should have bled you out
one painful ounce at a time .
i mean , that &apos;s what you deserved .
you left me behind in 1903,
which i did not appreciate ,
but i guess you forgot about that old canadian rock
filled with bennett blood .
anyway , even though i got out ,
now i kind of just want to make you suffer
in new--and if i may say so myself--
totally inspired ways .
what is this ?
keep watching .
what &apos;s happening to me ?
you didn &apos;t happen to pet a fuzzy ,
4 @-@ legged , vampire @-@ killing machine , did you ?
how do i fix it ?
easy . there &apos;s a cure in new orleans .
i &apos;ll go get it for you .
just tell me what you did to elena .
oh , i can &apos;t do that .
one thing you &apos;re not gonna do--
you &apos;re not gonna mess with me .
i am in a very volatile place right now ,
and i will start beheading people that i don &apos;t like ,
starting with you ,
if she doesn &apos;t wake up .
so what did you do to my damn girlfriend ?
it &apos;s just not as threatening
when i &apos;m seeing , like , 4 superblurry versions of you .
fix her ! i know it &apos;s a spell !
she &apos;s in perfect health .
and she &apos;ll stay that way until she wakes .
young , beautiful human elena gilbert ,
preserved in this moment indefinitely .
so , bonster ,
i linked elena &apos;s life to yours .
the rule is as long as you &apos;re alive ,
elena will remain asleep .
oh , my god .
please tell me you didn &apos;t .
oh , i totally did .
oh , and--oh , and please don &apos;t go looking
for some weird witchy work @-@ around
because , as the incredibly powerful leader of the geminis ,
i rigged this so that if you do try to outsmart it
both you and elena will die instantly .
i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is
your betrayal really hurt me , bon ,
so this is kind of all your fault .
you have to get out town now , bon .
i &apos;m not letting kai win .
bonnie , elena &apos;s the only thing that damon salvatore cares about .
he &apos;ll kill you .
you have to get out of here now .
damon , think about it .
every day that you wake up without elena in your arms ,
you &apos;ll have the burning desire to kill bonnie .
of course , you could just get it over with and kill her now ,
but elena will probably never speak to you again .
hang on . hang on . i just ...
i just need two seconds .
well , you are the one who chose a 5 @-@ mile hike
to say good @-@ bye to me .
this isn &apos;t good @-@ bye , stefan .
besides , this hike
is where i told you i didn &apos;t want to be a vampire .
i thought it would be fitting considering .
because you &apos;re a weak human again ?
you knew that i never wanted to be a vampire ,
even before we took our first steps up that mountain .
you just wanted to hear me say it out loud .
well , a lot of good that did .
i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is that
you knew me better than anyone .
you always have ,
which is why you already know how impossible it is for me to--
to find the words to say good @-@ bye .
don &apos;t .
i can &apos;t do this , not--not now , not ever .
where &apos;s damon ?
bonnie tracked kai .
he went to go beat the sleeping spell out of him .
stefan , this whole thing with elena ,
if they can &apos;t break the spell ,
are you gonna be ok ?
are you ?
of course not ,
but when she wakes up , she &apos;ll still be my best friend .
after bonnie &apos;s lived a long and happy life .
but you--you were soul mates ,
and i want to make sure that you &apos;re ok .
i don &apos;t think elena necessarily
came into my life to be my soul mate .
i mean , she was .
we loved each other ,
but she was also the only person i &apos;ve ever met
who actually believed that my brother was worth loving ,
and she reminded me that i used to
believe that about him , too ,
and her faith in him ,
it brought damon and me back together ,
and , yeah , i--i loved her
more than i ever thought i could love somebody else ,
but i think in the end
i needed him more than i needed her .
is that why ...
you feel you need to stay away from me ?
is it because you think that i haven &apos;t moved on ?
s--no . stefan , i--
i &apos;m sure it sounds like i &apos;m making a million excuses ,
but you and i--
i can &apos;t do this right now .
i &apos;m sorry .
hello !
anyone still alive , hmm ?
anyone alive , just raise your hand .
i need blood .
you need more than blood .
maybe some ointment .
&apos;cause gross .
do your friends think you &apos;re funny ?
because maybe if you were funny ,
if you were the one with the good jokes ,
who they could always count on to make them laugh ,
maybe they &apos;d be cool with letting you live instead of elena .
you are right . so the sick humor &apos;s your thing .
i &apos;m just the one that does magic .
undo the spell , kai !
i can &apos;t .
what &apos;s done is done .
ossox .
again !
i can &apos;t undo the spell , bonnie .
my death made it permanent .
fine . i &apos;ll just wait for the werewolf bite to kill you .
you know what &apos;s funny ?
i didn &apos;t even know werewolves were real
until i got bit by one .
the thing is , bon ,
the only way a guy turns into a wolf
is if it &apos;s magic , right ,
so technically , their venom &apos;s magic , too .
so i just went ahead and siphoned it up .
no , no .
motus .
just dance with me .
this was supposed to be our big night .
tell me , damon .
i can see it all over your face .
how bad is it ?
kai linked you to bonnie .
you won &apos;t wake up until she dies .
what ? !
he won , elena .
what are you gonna do ?
damon .
damon ?
bonnie .
bonnie .
damon .
how dumb are you ?
i deliver you a dying bonnie bennett on a silver platter , and--whoosh--
right over your head .
damon .
you &apos;re ok .
damon .
uh , translation-- she &apos;s about to croak .
damon .
of course , you don &apos;t have to help her .
you could just walk away .
she dies of a collapsed lung ,
no blood on your hands ,
and you and elena get to live the life you always dreamed of .
either way , you better act quick .
i &apos;m so sorry , bonnie .
that &apos;s it ? he just left you ?
the whole point was that this would torture him for a while .
i mean , you &apos;d think he &apos;d at least flip a coin--
heads , he picks you , tails , he picks--
heads it is .
you think i was gonna leave you all alone , huh ?
no way .
i &apos;m not out of nicknames for you yet .
ok . let &apos;s do this .
you two are up first .
it &apos;s easy , bon .
we just take her hand ...
close your eyes ...
and let her into your thoughts .
are we seriously having a sleepover ?
come on ! hurry up and get in here .
i &apos;m the one who gets to see her again .
i mean , you should get the better good @-@ bye .
oh , care . come here .
take care of everyone while i &apos;m gone , ok ?
i will .
i promise .
promise me something , both of you .
write it all down ,
everything that you accomplish in your lives , every crush ,
when you fall in love , when you start a family ,
every time you fantasize about wanting to kill damon .
write it down
so that one day when i wake up
i can read all about my best friends &apos; lives
and feel like i was there .
i &apos;m so sorry , elena .
really , i &apos;m so sorry .
this isn &apos;t your fault .
we &apos;ll both get everything that we want .
we just can &apos;t have it at the same time .
bonnie bennett ,
you have spent your entire life making sacrifices for me .
now it &apos;s my turn to do it for you .
i just have one more favor to ask .
ok .
ok .
can you do it one last time ?
there . i did it . are you happy ?
very .
now it &apos;s your turn to be .
so i &apos;m a cop , huh ?
that &apos;s my hope for you , matt .
in our crazy lives together ,
you &apos;ve always stayed the same--
human , loyal ,
and good .
my hope is that you spend the rest of your life
fighting for people like you .
you know , there &apos;s a good chance that i &apos;ll never see you again .
matt .
look at everything that the two of us have survived .
i like our odds .
you &apos;re gonna think that the pain will never end ,
but it will ,
but first , you have to let it all in .
you can &apos;t fight it .
it &apos;s bigger than you .
you have to let yourself drown in it ,
but then eventually , you &apos;ll start to swim ,
and every single breath that you fight for will make you stronger .
and i promise that you will beat it .
alaric .
jeremy .
i--i tried to be here sooner .
i wanted to be here for the wedding .
i &apos;m glad you weren &apos;t .
you made it !
3 canceled flights .
i could have walked here faster .
oh , and i was doing so well .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wanted to at least pretend to be strong for you .
when you do wake up ,
i want you to know that i spent my life
doing exactly what i felt i was born to do .
i was happy .
so where are we in this vision of yours ?
not here . not in mystic falls .
you need to get out of here , tyler .
you need to figure out what it is you want to do ,
who you want to be ,
and then just really fight for it .
you &apos;re gonna be fine , tyler .
you &apos;re a wolf now . embrace it . don &apos;t fight it .
let it be the thing that makes you extraordinary .
thank you for bumping into me that day in the hallway .
i thought i would never be happy again ,
and then--and then i met you .
you changed everything for me .
you--you quite literally saved my life .
i love you so much ,
which is why i can &apos;t wait to find out
what new life you--you &apos;ve chosen for yourself
in 60 or 70 years when i see you again .
i can guarantee it won &apos;t be high school .
just be happy .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
i &apos;ll see you , elena .
lorenzo .
you came back .
you must think me such a monster .
we &apos;re all monsters in some way , i suppose .
my life before my friends was misery .
even as a mother , a--a wife ,
i never felt whole ,
but then i found these people ,
and , uh , i felt a part of something .
can you understand that just a little ?
i can
because i &apos;ve been searching for that my whole life .
what is it ?
that building .
it wasn &apos;t there last night .
kai must have had this cloaked .
when he died--
it can &apos;t be !
lorenzo ...
it &apos;s our family .
you think she &apos;ll be safe here ?
if word gets out that her body has the cure inside ,
every vampire who wants to be a human
will come busting in through that door .
bonnie will spell it shut .
we &apos;re under strict orders not to open it for anyone .
i guess that means that--
that means it &apos;s time for me to say good @-@ bye .
you could have just told me what to do .
i knew what you were going to do .
you knew that the evil , selfish damon salvatore
would give up the love of his life
to save her best friend ?
i knew that the love of my life
would stand by his best friend
even if it meant having to live without me for a little while .
things are gonna be awfully dull around here without you .
no , they &apos;re not , damon ,
because you &apos;re not gonna sit around waiting for me .
i was thinking of doing the starvation diet
because desiccation makes the time go faster .
damon , this isn &apos;t gonna work if you just shut down .
i need you to live your life ,
enjoy yourself .
i want you to be happy .
now how about that dance ?
yesterday , you told me you made a list
of all the ways that loving me has ruined your life ,
and i get it .
i haven &apos;t made it easy on you ...
but i made a list , too ,
of all the ways that loving you has changed mine .
you were by my side when i needed a friend .
you made me laugh ,
you made me dance .
you told me that i would find love again ...
and i understand if you need time to heal
and to live your life without me ,
and i understand if i have to wait for you ,
and i will .
i &apos;ll wait ,
and when you &apos;re ready for me ,
i will be ready for you .
are you ready for this ?
ready to spend the next 60 years of my life without you in it ?
who &apos;s ever gonna be ready for that ?
i love you , damon salvatore .
i love you , too .
