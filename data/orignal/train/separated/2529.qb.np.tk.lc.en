ay , caramba !

you are about to see the worst half @-@ hour
of television ever .
all righty then .
okay , r3 , let &apos;s serve up some soup .
may the sauce be with you .
oh , since when is soup sauce ?
this is so non @-@ canonical .
you have every right to be furious .
oh , it &apos;s as bad as i remembered ,
and i haven &apos;t watched it since yesterday .
horrible , yet enthralling .
a card from dr. hibbert .
头等大事 一月三号给我打电话
i &apos;ll be right home , honey .
i just got to lock down the reactor for the evening .

嘻哈和撒那
... and the baseball exclaimed
as it flew out of sight ,
this ballpark is shorter in left field than right .
martinez swings and misses .
yes ! i &apos;m recording this during a game .
since the united states government
declares this man to be santa claus ,
this court will not dispute it .
few people know that verdict
was overturned in the sequel .
i better be heading home to my family .
enjoy your evening with your wonderful ...
uh ... neon sign .
yeah , last year i broke it just so the repairman would come .
but i &apos;ll be fine .
hey , um , you gonna be okay ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
super !
it &apos;s just that ... you know , i lost my ma at christmas .
she took me to a mall , and i never saw her again .
but i &apos;ll never forget that image
of her bolting for the parking lot .
okay , okay . i &apos;ll stay for one beer .
oh , great , great . but don &apos;t do it out of pity .
pity ! pity ! have pity !
look , i &apos;m wrapped around your leg here !
please ! please ! please !
but i promised marge .

okay , okay !
mom , where &apos;s dad ?
i don &apos;t know .
aw , it &apos;s christmas eve , man !
we do not want to set a precedent
for fat guys being late tonight !
* silent night *
* holy night *
i &apos;m happy on christmas eve .
and for once it &apos;s not &apos; cause some drunk
left a wallet on his stool .
uh @-@ oh , this is starting to hurt .
and now , homer , it &apos;s only fair that i give yous a gift .
i &apos;m gonna set the clock in the bar to the correct time .
hey , what the ...
i am so late !
whoa , whoa . it &apos;s the night before christmas !
stop stirring , you !
one night .
the one night of the year
i want homer home with his family ,
and he can &apos;t even do that .
christmas is a great time to dump him .
if you do it now , you won &apos;t have to watch the super bowl .
homer simpson !
i never thought i &apos;d say this
to someone i cared for ,
much less my husband ,
but i &apos;m saying it now .
i don &apos;t want you here on christmas !
marge , think about what you &apos;re saying .
it &apos;s sir isaac newton &apos;s birthday .
out now !
yeah ? well , good luck
assembling all those toys without me !
we already did it .
the ghost of marge future !
she &apos;ll forgive me .
should i forgive him ?
especially this time .
maybe not this time .
i mean it &apos;s christmas .
with his marriage in this much trouble ,
he &apos;s got a lot of thinking to do .
i wonder if there &apos;s birds on the moon .
i miss marge .
i wonder if lou suspects that i was his secret santa .
what kind of a cheapskate gives you
one corncob holder for christmas ?
moe , what are you doing ?
good king wenceslas looked out on the feast ...
voice too poor for karaoke .
shutting down .
bye now .
oh , my god .
santa brought me just what i asked for !

hmm . &quot; 239 . &quot;
who &apos;s he fooling ?
hey , pal . can &apos;t believe you have to work christmas eve .
well , if you &apos;re here for a last minute gift ,
we have a cell phone holder that fits
no cell phone made after 2002 .
and , uh , kwik @-@ e @-@ nog .
nog stands for &quot; not okayed by government . &quot;
maybe marge would forgive me if i won the lotto .
give me a scratcher .
d &apos;oh ! give me another one .
d &apos;oh !
give me another one .
d &apos;oh !
give me another one .
d &apos;oh ! give me another one .
d &apos;oh !

oh please , stop ! stop it !
my religion prohibits me from taking advantage
of a fool more than ten times .
this thing basically has no winners .
yeah , but doesn &apos;t the money goes to schools ?
you have been to our schools . what do you think ?
welcome to bring us your toilet paper night .
don &apos;t worry , none goes to willie .
don &apos;t need it .
i got me starbucks napkins !
you know , ironically , in india , they did use the money
for schools and they had fantastic results .
aw , thanks for your honesty , apu .
is there any other product in the store
you &apos;d like to warn me about ?
well , uh ...
those hot dogs began life as twinkies .
christmas eve .
the one night a kid wants to go to sleep
is the one night he can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t have another cocoa .
my pee is starting to smell like a ski chalet .
oh , thank god you &apos;re here .
i need to get to sleep .
tell me the story of jazz again .
well , the story of jazz starts with the tresillo ,
the most prevalent duple @-@ pulse rhythmic cell
in sub @-@ saharan african music .
but the rest will have to wait .
bart , bart , i hear mom sobbing .
and i don &apos;t know where dad is .
if it helps , i made you a card .
bart , this is the year i &apos;ve got to nail christmas .
i don &apos;t want to be a jaded ten @-@ year @-@ old like you !
i remember christmas eve when i was eight .
why do you always wait till the last minute
to put up the lights ?
i don &apos;t want to ruin the magic .
and i certainly ...
next year
this is
your job .
hmm , they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad
in a santa suit getting hanged
and electrocuted on christmas eve .
i &apos;ll help you , kid .
mom , i &apos;m just a kid ,
but i say if dad isn &apos;t here christmas morning ,
that &apos;s the kind of thing families never recover from .
lisa , sweetie , i &apos;m tired of being a pushover .
you &apos;re not a pushover .
you can &apos;t smoke .
just chewing on the wood .
okay then .
eh , how you doing there ?
uh , your front door was locked ,
so , uh , rather than call or knock ,
i , uh , came down your chimney there .
moe szyslak , you didn &apos;t climb down our chimney
just to say &quot; merry christmas . &quot;
midge , it &apos;s one minute till christmas ,
and if i &apos;m ever gonna be a good guy , it &apos;s now .
all right , here i go .
i &apos;m the one that kept homer from coming home ,
&apos;cause , uh , well , i was lonely .
yeah , that &apos;s right--
me , mr. party pants .
so , uh , so don &apos;t hold it against homer , eh ?
oh , my poor homie .
this is what i was hoping for .
for it not to have been completely his fault .
thank you , moe .
i &apos;m sorry , marge , i &apos;m sorry ,
but it was christmas , and we were under the mistletoe .
that &apos;s lettuce caught in a spider &apos;s web .
all right .
i &apos;ve got to call homer .
d &apos;oh !
what gives ? don &apos;t you get showtime extreme ?
no answer .
let &apos;s go find your father .
what ?
i never give up hope .
neither do i.
even the anchor store &apos;s closed .

and a cute model ...
airplane that lost its propeller .
um , i guess i &apos;ll take the concentration camp one .
and a merry christmas to you , sir .
well , if i got to spend christmas eve alone ,
at least no one will see me .
hey @-@ ya , homer !
ah , just &apos; cause you &apos;re here shouldn &apos;t make you sad .
this is my 17th christmas alone in a movie theater .
this is my family .
the guy with the smelly pants ,
the lady that carries empty cans in a pbs tote bag .
ugh , what if i left now and gave you guys my popcorn and soda ?
wow , homer , you have a very generous side .
can i borrow , like , $ 10,000 ?
flanders ? what are you doing here ?
christmas is my busy season .
sold three pairs of scissors this month .
two came back .
say , flanders ,
with all the hard luck you &apos;ve had ,
how do you stay so happy ?
and don &apos;t say &quot; jesus . &quot;
well , sir , our good lord and my boys are all i &apos;ve really got .
all edna left me was wonderful memories
and some ungraded papers ,
which i &apos;m still working my way through .
flanders , are you crying ?
ah , just snowflakes on my mustache .
listen , could i buy a left @-@ handed , uh ...
i don &apos;t know , eyelash curler ?
sure , but y @-@ your eyelashes are long and luxurious already .
are you just buying this to be nice ?
uh , maybe .
oh , homer , unto us this day , a neighbor is born .
but why ?
because jerk @-@ ass homer has become ass @-@ jerk homer .
well , that curled my lashes , but good for you .
you &apos;re all right , stupid flanders .

abe simpson , please .
visitor for abe simpson .
you came !
you came to see me !
easter came early this year .
i thought we were just gonna ask if he &apos;d seen homer .
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve awoken a needy giant .
visitors !
let &apos;s brew some weak tea and talk about the good ol &apos; days !
make them turn the tv to cbs !
well , with all that you folks have experienced ,
i think we could enjoy listening to a little of your wisdom .
the problem with puerto ricans is ...
no casual racism .
what the ... ?
the nutcracker .
every child &apos;s favorite christmas character .
is this a dream ?
not a dream .
i work at the mall .
and it &apos;s closed , so scram .
man , you are a nutcracker .
but i &apos;ve learned something tonight--
you know how everyone hates
being with their family on christmas ?
well , being without them is worse .
can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break ?
all right , listen , pal , uh ...
you want to go to a party ?
what are you doing here ?
halloween merchandise goes on sale december 26 , man .
well , he &apos;s not in the neon sign store .
lady , buy a sign or go home .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m trying to find my husband , and nothing &apos;s open .
well , there is a party here .
hey , is your husband into people dressed like food ?
where is this party ? !
oh , my god .
is that girl really doing that ? !
mm , load @-@ bearing wall .
this party &apos;s great ,
but all i wish is that i was drinking a beer
with my kids right now .
homer ?
homie , i &apos;m your present tonight .
and the present is that i &apos;m not gonna always assume that you screwed up .
because i realize maybe there &apos;s a good explanation for what you do .
or a crazy one that &apos;s pretty entertaining .
oh , marge , you found me !
you always find me .
now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot .
i thought i had one of those chirping keys .
oh , well , i &apos;ve been faking the noise .
&apos;cause you deserve the best .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
i love you just the same .
thank you magical creatures of the mall !
you have all taught me a christmas message
i &apos;ll never forget--
the place to get drunk is at home .
圣诞节快乐 辛普森一家
all right , i &apos;m sick of waiting .
bart , you know you can &apos;t open a present
till mom and dad wake up .
it &apos;s 9 : 10 a.m.
i know what they &apos;re doing-- they &apos;re up in bed
watching the re @-@ broadcast of the hollywood christmas parade .
oops , my finger slipped .
oops ! so did mine .
oh , i got a baseball glove .
i got a chemistry set .
i want yours .
merry christmas , son .
uh , don &apos;t you mean &quot; happy birthday &quot; ?
it &apos;s two presents .
um , walkie @-@ talkies don &apos;t count as two presents .
god .
i mean , you .
idiot .
behold , our miracle of birth .
each birth is followed by another birth
just seconds later .
what the ? ! this isn &apos;t halloween .
