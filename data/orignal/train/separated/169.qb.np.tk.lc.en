gossip girl here
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
this is my boyfriend dan humphrey .
hi . dan , this is miss carr. she &apos;s my favorite new teacher .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m taking your advice to come out to brooklyn sometime .
why would you turn down yale ?
yeah. why--why would you do that ?
brown is just a better fit for me , dan .
do we still fit ?
this is a &quot; b . &quot; second semester seniors get a free pass .
you want to get rachel back for the grade she gave you ?
i can &apos;t risk not getting into yale .
i just wanted to teach you a lesson .
inviting me to a closed restaurant for dinner ?
ms. carr told me what you did .
if you complete detention to my satisfaction ,
yale will still be possible .
is it war ?
yes ...
but this one will be different .

第二季 第十七集
while upper east siders are hitting the snooze button ,
blair waldorf had a rude awakening
when the rooster crowed at dawn this morning .
never ...
in my 16,982 hours of schooling
have i ever been sentenced to detention .
i can &apos;t believe
you added up all the hours of class we &apos;ve had .
makes me wanna play hooky .
one month with ms.carr ,
and i &apos;m serving a week of hard time .
dorota ! hey , be more thorough !
well , i think you might &apos;ve
had a little something to do with that .
the opera ? the boathouse ? ring a bell ?
look , all i know is
i &apos;ve never had a teacher who &apos;s actually taken me seriously .
it feels like she really gets me . is--is that weird ?
looks like humphrey has some competition .
well , dan and i have barely spoken all week .
they say conversation is the first thing to go .
we will talk .
there &apos;s just a lot going on right now ..
look , b , i gotta go .
i know where rachel eats breakfast ,
and i have to drop off my extra credit essay
before i go to school . i &apos;ll see you there .
serena &apos;s sympathetic to the enemy .
i have to cross her off my list of recruits .
give me that , quick ! come on ! quick !
daddy !
what a nice surprise !
handsome and i thought we &apos;d bring you some breakfast .
thank you .
ahh. you know , blair bear , i &apos;m proud of you .
you &apos;re handling your punishment with such grace .
well , we waldorfs are nothing if not graceful .
i wish you &apos;d let me speak to the school .
it sounds like this teacher &apos;s been after you from the start .
thank you . but i wanted to handle this on my own .
that speaks volumes
of the mature young lady you &apos;ve become .
i wish everyone could see me through your eyes .
you keep your chin up .
i &apos;ll see you after school .
bye @-@ bye .
miss blair , your martyr act--
no good .
pick up the pace , shall we ?
i have to say , dan , i like this story
even more than the last one you showed me .
i can totally relate to the sense of isolation ,
feeling like an outsider .
an outsider ? you ?
well , you know what ? it took me ten years to master
the local @-@ express @-@ local switchback .
and this morning ? gotta say
you rose the subway like a native .
do any other constance / st. jude &apos;s students
ever take the subway ?
uh , no . most of them have limos with drivers .
and overbearing parents , overbooked schedules ...
and overflowing bank accounts .
and a distracting sense of self @-@ absorption .
school is the last thing on their minds ,
which is why i &apos;ve been talking to headmistress queller
about some ideas i have
to get the students more focused on learning .
oh , really ? what do you have planned ?
rachel . dan .
hi , serena .
you guys are ... hanging out ?
yeah , well , rachel has been giving me , uh ,
some feedback on my stories .
and by &quot; feedback , &quot; he means &quot; a wall of praise . &quot;
dan is a really good writer .
trust me , i know .
okay , all right , now i gotta go .
so ... see ya at school .
is that your &quot; king lear &quot; essay ?
dan has this amazing cordelia reference
in one of his stories .
oh , um , i was wondering ,
can i have a little bit more time ?
uh , sure .
hey . nathaniel , did we speak last night ?
no . why ? what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m not sure , but i think last night
may have been the greatest night
of my life .
really ?
what are you doing right now ?
i &apos;m waiting for vanessa . why ?
write down this address .
blair .
if i &apos;m correct , you completed your detention
this morning .
yes , ms. carr .
signed and dated by the preservation society .
i hope the experience was educational .
i made friends with a family of squirrels
and had lots of time to think .
oh . henry david thoreau
found nature inspiring as well .
i &apos;ll see you in class .
girls , now that my days of
community service are behind me ,
time for a takedown .
hello ?
do you need a refresher ?
i say . you do .
to be honest , blair ,
none of us are that into 5 : 00 a.m. trash duty .
i think we &apos;re gonna sit this one out .
excuse me ?
b. , why are you doing this ?
queller will tell yale
you &apos;re finished with detention ,
and it &apos;s over . this is madness .
no !
this is constance !
don &apos;t you see ?
if cornflower mary can come in here
and tell us how to run things ,
then everything we &apos;ve stood for ,
for all these years , is nothing .
this isn &apos;t about yale .
this is about our legacy .
what we do here today echoes through eternity .
who &apos;s with me ?
sorry , b. this is your vendetta .
students !
pay attention !
what is this ?
new school policy
there will be no cell phone usage
during school hours .
quiet , please .
every morning before you enter the building ,
you will check your phones .
is this a joke ?
i feel nauseous .
somebody pinch me .
i &apos;m in my own worst nightmare .
who could be behind such pure evil ?
well , well , well .
now you with me ?
what do you want us to do ?
every great leader knows
you don &apos;t send your girls into the field unarmed .
if we know blair waldorf ,
munitions are on their way .
she &apos;s been like this for the past hour .
i think it &apos;s withdrawal .
she hasn &apos;t checked &quot; gossip girl &quot;
in an hour and a half .
is--is a scandal still a scandal
if you--you can &apos;t text about it ?
that &apos;s very zen .
did anyone see you ?
no , miss blair .
and you have what i asked for ?
thank you , jesus .
no . thank you , blair .
and thank you , dorota .
please , i @-@ i need to check the dow .
nelly yuki , get a grip !
girls ...
these phones are our ammo .
i want you to dig deep-- and i mean deep--
into rachel &apos;s past .
we &apos;re gonna run that commie cornhusker
straight out of constance .
please tell me what we &apos;re doing here .
yeah , and talk about the filthy rich--
w @-@ what happened to you ?
yesterday , i received an envelope .
inside was a business card
with an address , a date and a time on it .
no name .
i assumed it was
some overly designed invitation
to a business meeting .
when i arrived at the address ,
it was something different entirely .
a high @-@ stakes poker game ?
or an arms dealer auction ?
the ultimate private gentleman &apos;s club .
i walked through this door , and it was ...
the chuck bass version of narnia ?
she was the most beautiful woman i &apos;ve ever seen .
it &apos;s like she was waiting for me ...
ready to serve ...
knowing my every desire--
okay , we don &apos;t need details .
sadly , i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s as far as it went .
i woke up alone in a hotel room .
in a cruel twist of fate , i don &apos;t even remember her name .
well , what exactly do you remember ?
not a lot .
i &apos;m hoping coming here will change that .
between milking cows in des moines
and teaching low income kids to read and write ,
ms.carr is clean as a whistle .
seriously , she &apos;s the midwestern mother theresa .
impossible , hazel .
your methods of inquiry must be as tired as your hair .
we searched everywhere .
my fingers are raw .
when the truth fails you ,
you have no choice but to abandon it .
make something up ...
idiots .
with friends like these , who needs friends ?
oh !
oh !
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
are you okay ?
yeah , no , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s just a file folder . it &apos;s not a brick wall .
i meant before that. you didn &apos;t even notice me
until you nearly knocked me over .
no , no , no. no , i @-@ i noticed you .
uh , i was just actually thinking
how much i like your sweater .
thanks .
not that i didn &apos;t like what you were wearing yesterday
or that i even remember ... a @-@ a yellow sweater
and , uh , those shoe boot things .
dan ?
yeah. breathe .
right. oxygen-- it &apos;s good for the brain .
uh , yeah , i ...
ladies , you can give your tiny brains a rest .
once again , the world has proven anything you can do ,
i can do better .
sorry about that .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re on your way to class or-- it--
no , i &apos;m just--
ms. carr and dan humphrey ? are they really ?
who cares ? but i have a friend in cyberspace
who &apos;ll know just what to do .
lonely boy and ms.carr ? mary kay letourneau
x @-@ o @-@ x @-@ o .
oh , good job , man .
way to go .
what ? yeah , dude .
hey , this day is getting weirder by the minute .
anything you want to tell me ?
uh , besides i &apos;m glad
you &apos;re not wearing that raccoon makeup anymore ?
&apos;cause you looked like one of the incredibles .
oh , thanks a lot .
and i thought i was the bad seed in the family .
what ? wha--all right , what &apos;s going on ?
&quot; is--is lonely boy giving a certain new teacher
more than just an apple ? &quot; what does that mean ,
and--and why is it written on your hand ?
&apos;cause nelly yuki wouldn &apos;t give me her contraband phone
to show you myself . i mean , this is just the headline .
the whole post would &apos;ve gone all the way up my arm .
it was quite detailed about you and ms.carr
and your forbidden love .
m @-@ me and ms.carr ?
mm @-@ hmm. what ? no. that &apos;s absurd. that is absurd .
well , i &apos;m not the one you need to convince .
i will see you later .
dan , tell me this is not true .
do you really need to ask ?
if there &apos;s something you need to say , then say it now .
no , there &apos;s not. there &apos;s not , i swear .
i have no idea who sent that text or why .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry i doubted you .
just ... things were so weird between us this morning ,
and then this ... i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ i guess i was just confused .
yeah , i &apos;m right there with you .
who--why would someone want to do this ?
i mean , i thought everyone loved rachel .
well , i do know someone who &apos;s not exactly her biggest fan .
blair got trash duty in central park because of her .
if blair did this to rachel , this--
i mean , she &apos;s gone way too far .
so the ultimate gentlemen &apos;s club was here ?
because this place reminds me of my aunt &apos;s house .
this was the place . i knew it .
there were velvet curtains blocking this hallway .
there were women wearing masks ,
lying on a divan right where this piano is .
all right , listen , maybe you should get some rest .
it could help jog your memory .
or warm ginger ale .
it &apos;s a miracle hangover cure .
this is her. this is the woman .
let me see .
no way. the mom ? this must be her house .
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
the ladies &apos; room ?
i knew you and serena were having problems .
i had no clue they were anatomical .
the only reason i &apos;m trespassing on sacred ground
is because i know you sent that rumor to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
sorry. no idea what you &apos;re talking about. you can go now .
look , whatever issues you have with rachel ,
she cares about people . she cares about her job .
oh ... that is so sweet .
maybe you should write a short story about it
and have rachel give you notes ... naked .
i &apos;m just-- all right , okay . all right .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t give this to you earlier .
i know it &apos;s silly , but the reason is , um ,
well , dan ...
he &apos;s so confident in his writing that i ...
i don &apos;t know . i was just a little intimidated .
dan &apos;s talented , but his confidence comes
from a lifetime of encouragement and praise .
i &apos;m guessing , for you , birthdays rarely meant new pens
and a notebook to fill with your ideas .
yeah , more like a chanel wallet and a credit card
to get me out of the house .
thank you .
oh , my god , that &apos;s ms . carr .
it &apos;s like i have spinach in my teeth or something .
and i don &apos;t . i even went to the bathroom to check .
mm @-@ hmm , yeah , it &apos;s actually not spinach .
um , it &apos;s a rumor--
a pretty ugly one about you and dan .
but i @-@ i know it &apos;s not true .
a rumor about me and dan .
i &apos;ve been at this school long enough
to know what that means. unbelievable .
yeah , well , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ve been on &quot; gossip girl &quot; plenty of times ,
and for the worst things .
some of them were true , some of them weren &apos;t .
but eventually , everyone forgets .
the best thing to do with these things
is just nothing at all .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
oh , yeah , it &apos;s , um , it &apos;s a web site where a girl posts gossip .
well , at least we think it &apos;s a girl .
and where does she get her tips ?
um , it &apos;s anonymous , so no one really knows .
but i gotta get to class .
hey , rachel .
you got a minute ?
yeah .
it is a great piece of property .
i &apos;m surprised anyone would want to sell .
the husband finally caved , agreed to a greenwich commute .
husband. mm @-@ hmm .
the woman with the baby in the picture--
i just assumed ... the nanny .
i thought prospective buyers would like that photo .
the nanny . of course .
look , there &apos;s some , uh , questions
i &apos;d like to ask the owners .
nothing serious .
noise , neighbors , that sort of thing .
i &apos;ll do my best to answer them ,
but i can &apos;t give out a client &apos;s personal information .
it &apos;s policy .
of course . i understand .
but i &apos;m sure you know what the bass name means
in real estate .
if you were to help me , maybe you &apos;d allow me
to extend the same professional
courtesy to you in the future ?
well , i could never do anything unprofessional .
but sometimes i do leave a file unattended
when i go to get a drink .
there &apos;s some bottled water in the fridge .
are you thirsty ?
parched .
hello ?
yes , is this the philips residence ?
yes .
i @-@ i hope i &apos;m not disturbing you .
i was wondering if i could speak with your nanny , please .
i &apos;m sorry .
elle &apos;s with the children at the park .
can i take a message ?
elle. we met last night in manhattan .
i just wanted to thank her for a lovely evening .
that &apos;s impossible . elle was here in greenwich last night
watching the children .
you &apos;re sure ?
absolutely .
could--could i leave a message , please ?
can you tell her chuck bass called ?
my number is 646 ...
i was told you wanted to see me , headmistress queller ?
miss waldorf , please have a seat .
this school has been aware of
the &quot; gossip girl &quot; web site for some time .
up until now , the content has focused on the students .
the students haven &apos;t complained ,
so we &apos;ve turned a blind eye .
however , now that a teacher has become involved ,
i have no choice but to deal with it .
i &apos;m sorry . i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
blair .
i know you posted the rumor about me .
whatever rumor you &apos;re talking about ,
i had nothing to do with it .
i find this accusation preposterous .
ms. temmel , would you please send the student in ?
thank you .
someone came forward and identified you as the source .
let me guess-- dan humphrey ?
this information was then confirmed by a witness .
if i don &apos;t go ivy league , my dad will kill me .
it was my record or yours .
we tried to tell you something like this would happen ,
but you just wouldn &apos;t listen . i &apos;m sorry , blair .
blair , your actions threatened the reputation
of the entire teaching staff and this school .
you give me no choice but to ask you
to leave constance billard .
you &apos;re expelling me ?
headmistress queller is standing firm on the expulsion .
yale will revoke my acceptance
as soon as they receive word .
this is my darkest hour .
blair , if you started that rumor
about dan humphrey and the teacher ,
she has a legitimate case for slander .
i need to know .
did you ?
i might &apos;ve posted something on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
all the girls do it .
it &apos;s how we communicate .
but anything i wrote was the truth .
i didn &apos;t lie .
i promise , daddy .
all right . then you should &apos;ve been honest
with the headmistress about that .
but the real issue here is not teenagers gossiping online .
it &apos;s not ?
no , it &apos;s that a teacher is having
an inappropriate relationship with a student .
i &apos;m going to contact my lawyers . we &apos;re gonna fight this .
fight it ? oh , i don &apos;t--
you will not be punished for telling the truth .
thank you , daddy .
so you ratted on blair ? you templeton .
a &quot; charlotte &apos;s web &quot; -sult ? that &apos;s very cute .
and , no , technically , i did not rat on blair .
i just told rachel to put the squeeze
on the weakest of her kilted cronies .
and what does serena think of
you getting her best friend expelled ?
the moment blair involves me in her schemes ,
the &quot; boyfriend of the b.f.f. &quot; clause
is officially null and void . so she brought it on herself .
the alleged online slander incident ?
what ? you , um ... you heard about the rumor ?
you gave it a name ?
well , the parents &apos; council called
an emergency meeting tonight .
apparently , my son is the object of the slander ,
assuming that it is slander-- you and ms. carr .
a package for vanessa abrams .
saved by the bell .
dan , if i &apos;m gonna walk into a room
full of fired @-@ up parents , i need to know .
is there something we need to talk about ?
i &apos;m gonna go file this .
no , there &apos;s--no , there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
my tea is getting cold .
hey , thanks for meeting me .
i brought these to keep us warm .
oh , thanks .
after everything that &apos;s gone on this week ,
i feel safer meeting outside .
we can talk freely .
i swept the perimeter for bugs .
ms. carr , i @-@ i understand that you &apos;re upset with blair .
what she did was wrong .
but does her punishment have to be expulsion ?
it means she &apos;ll lose yale .
do you think this is a step i wanted to take ?
i feel terrible ,
but blair posted a rumor that threatened
to destroy my career , my future .
and getting expelled destroys blaire &apos;s future .
please just talk to headmistress queller
and ask her to reconsider .
&quot; gossip girl &quot; is just a stupid web site .
how can you say that , when its sole purpose is
to allow people to post terrible things about each other ?
i &apos;m not defending &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i &apos;m defending my best friend .
believe me , serena , i &apos;m sorry this all happened .
but i have to go .
i have an appointment before the parents &apos; meeting .
i do hope we can still be friends .
hello ?
hey .
i @-@ i @-@ i really thought that rachel would come around , but ...
i &apos;m sorry , b.
dorota .
blair ? blair ?
give handsome to a homeless man .
make sure he has kind eyes .
i &apos;m not going to yale .
i don &apos;t deserve you .
okay , i &apos;m back .
just hang in there , okay ?
we &apos;ll figure something out .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re all here on a saturday night .
that &apos;s a lot of canceled restaurant reservations .
well , you expel one yale @-@ bound senior ,
it gets people &apos;s attention .
harold , how are you ?
lily .
mwah . i &apos;m hoping that i can count on your support tonight .
blair is being horribly scapegoated .
i thought the meeting
was to discuss the school &apos;s new online honor codes .
yes , well , i &apos;m crashing it to advocate for my daughter .
harold waldorf .
well , i &apos;m here to make sure no other students
are slandered the way my son was by your daughter .
rufus humphrey .
okay , we &apos;ll see you inside , harold .
nathaniel .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
now you &apos;re not still thinking about that girl , are you ?
her name is elle .
and if you must know , i &apos;m late for my chiropractor .
she &apos;s double @-@ jointed .
makes the &quot; kama sutra &quot; feel new again .
nice to see you &apos;re moving on .
call me tomorrow , all right ?
i just wanted to thank you for yesterday .
i don &apos;t have any friends in the city ,
and telling me about blair , you really acted like one .
oh , anytime. and , you know , if you ever need
a @-@ a character witness to vouch for how fantastic you are ,
uh , i &apos;m your guy .
that &apos;s sweet. thank you .
a character witness .
do you know it may have come to that ?
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t-- i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
no , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m ... overwhelmed .
and this rumor is just ... so insulting .
an affair with a student ? me and you ?
i would n @-@ never do that .
never ? w @-@ wow , that &apos;s ... definitive .
please , don &apos;t ... take it personally .
i mean ...
no , no .
if you were older or ...
not a student at the brother school .
you can call me in five years .
here .
uh , dan--
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . i just--
no , i @-@ i--
i know . um , it &apos;s ...
not appropriate .
uh , i @-@ i &apos;m late .
spotted--lonely boy going from teacher &apos;s pet
to persona non grata
in the pitter @-@ patter of a heartbeat .
that invitation wasn &apos;t for you .
you were never supposed to be at that party .
what do you remember ?
all i remember is you .
that &apos;s ... not what i was referring to .
i can &apos;t remember anything else .
why don &apos;t you fill me in ?
i wasn &apos;t at that party to meet you .
i was there for another man .
who ?
your father .
my father ?
my father is--
i know that ... now .
i took over a girl &apos;s client list .
i sent the invitation without realizing .
when you told me your name was chuck ,
i realized that i had the wrong mr. bass .
i had to get you out of there .
i @-@ i had to make sure that you didn &apos;t remember anything
that you saw .
the drink ... so you drugged me
and then snuck back to connecticut ?
what matters is that i left you at that hotel to keep you safe .
safe from what ?
hey , look ...
the whole &quot; eyes wide shut &quot; mystery has been fun .
but if my father was part of this group ,
i have a right to know who they are .
turn on cnn .
walk down wall street. go to washington .
that &apos;s who they are .
and if they find out that i let an outsider in ...
lose the card , the stamp on your arm will fade ,
and stop asking questions. stop looking .
i &apos;ll protect you .
how ?
your own father was one of them ,
and you didn &apos;t even know it .
don &apos;t contact me again .
a courier delivered this to me this morning .
do i need a password ?
the password ...
is newport. mm .
&apos;cause that &apos;s where my mom is tonight. mm .
turns out i can still apply to oberlin .
the face , serena .
try to pretend it &apos;s not totally tragic .
you were right about dan and rachel .
seriously ?
i must &apos;ve picked up on something .
we need proof .
you have proof ? give it to me .
dan said that nothing was going on ,
so i should probably just talk to him first .
and give him another opportunity to lie to you ?
how awful .
i &apos;m so sorry , s .
but this is the smoking gun i &apos;ve been waiting for .
blair .
we have to get to that meeting .
dorota !
yes , miss blair .
go get my dog back !
meet me at constance asap s
come on .
this is a freedom of speech issue .
the school cannot control what our children write
on a public site .
what your daughter posted was slander .
she should be held accountable .
if slander &apos;s the issue ,
we can seek an injunction against &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
shut the site down .
shut it down ?
yes , and a hundred others will pop up in its place .
this isn &apos;t some note on the bathroom wall , lil .
it &apos;s on the internet that dan slept with a teacher .
that &apos;s wrong .
i agree .
but should blair lose yale over this ?
it &apos;s her whole future , rufus .
well , what about dan &apos;s future ?
how long is this gonna follow him ?
miss waldorf , this meeting is closed to students .
i &apos;m sorry for the interruption .
but i have something i think almost everyone
here would want to see .
headmistress , if you &apos;d like to check your e @-@ mail ...
i believe it &apos;s called exculpatory evidence .
i love &quot; damages . &quot;
hey . i @-@ i &apos;m here . what &apos;s going on ?
if you wanted to break up with me ,
you could &apos;ve just said so .
i trusted you , and you lied to me--both of you .
wh @-@ what ?
no , i saw you and rachel in the coffee shop .
well , yeah , rachel was upset , and i @-@ i comforted her .
i probably shouldn &apos;t have , because she pulled away , but ...
wait . y @-@ you didn &apos;t kiss her ?
no , no , no , i didn &apos;t kiss her . why would you think that ?
because it looked like ...
oh , god . i @-@ i ...
i took a photo and then i left ,
because i didn &apos;t want to see anymore .
wait a minute .
oh , my god. okay , uh , well , y @-@ you can &apos;t show this to anyone .
i gave it to blair .
sh @-@ she &apos;s in there with queller and the parents
and--and rachel , too .
dad. dad , it &apos;s not true .
dan , you and i will talk at home .
they fired me .
i &apos;m back in .
i saved myself and &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
you used this photo of rachel and me to back up a rumor
that is nothing more than a vengeful lie .
so ?
blair , unh @-@ unh .
you say &quot; lie . &quot; i say &quot; eerily prophetic . &quot;
blair ?
daddy .
i was going to congratulate you .
the driver will take you home .
i need some fresh air .
daddy , please .
look , i get why blair went after rachel ,
but why--why you ?
well , i felt like a fool . i thought you lied to me .
well , i told you nothing was going on .
i know .
so why were you so ready to believe the worst ?
honestly ...
i think part of me wanted to .
dan ...
we keep trying to act like we can overcome anything .
yeah , pretending that none of it mattered .
our parents dating ,
sharing a brother ...
i mean , different colleges next year , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s over , isn &apos;t it ?
well , we had to try .
yeah .
sometimes the only thing left to do
is to wrap your arms around each other one last time
and then just let go .
lily told me about you and serena . are you okay ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m okay about serena .
what happened in the meeting ?
well , once the parents saw the photo of you and ms . carr ,
her fate was pretty much sealed .
rachel didn &apos;t do anything .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m the one who screwed up .
look , i believe the two of you weren &apos;t having an affair .
but meeting a student , one she didn &apos;t even teach ,
off @-@ hours , after school ...
you voted to fire her , didn &apos;t you ?
you just got into yale . i was protecting your future .
by firing someone that didn &apos;t do anything wrong ?
you know , you talk about these park avenue parents
who shield their kids from punishment .
well , i should be punished , not her .
it &apos;s over , dan. let it go .
you left this at the park .
that &apos;s why i went to the coffee shop yesterday .
the coffee shop ?
i &apos;m the one that took the photo and gave it to blair .
you &apos;re the only teacher
that &apos;s ever expressed any interest in me ,
and i &apos;ve completely ruined it .
your essay .
i read it last night. it was wonderful ,
filled with nuanced observations
about the world around you. huh .
there &apos;s some unexpected irony .
rachel , i &apos;m really sorry .
serena ...
i think you should go .
you &apos;ll frolic in the vineyards ,
play boules with old men .
roman got you a chanel beret .
do you really have to take him with you ?
well , how was i to know
when i asked your mother if we could get you a bulldog
that she assumed we meant a stuffed animal ?
blair ...
i &apos;m worried about you .
why ? i &apos;m back at constance . i got into yale .
everything &apos;s perfect again .
i saw a different side of you last night ,
and i &apos;m disappointed .
but , daddy , i was right .
no , you were lucky .
and you allowed me to defend a lie--
a lie that you looked me in the eyes and told .
why did you do that ?
yale was on the line .
i have to go there ,
like you .
it &apos;s our plan
sweetheart , what matters most to me
is not which college you go to .
it &apos;s what kind of a person you grow up to be .
why don &apos;t i take you and handsome to the airport ?
dorota can make a picnic , and we eat it in the car .
no . i think we should just say good @-@ bye now .
i &apos;ll call you as soon as i land .
we both have a lot to think about .
they say every action has an equal and opposite reaction .
and once something is set in motion ,
it can &apos;t help but build momentum .
father , what were you involved in ?
elle ?
no , it &apos;s alan philips .
elle called us from grand central last night ,
but she never got off the train in greenwich .
have you heard from her ?
um , no. uh , but i &apos;ll let you know if i do .
we &apos;re very worried .
i &apos;d appreciate it .
uh , what are you doing here ?
i , uh , i came to apologize .
that rumor would &apos;ve gone away .
but--but that hug was just totally stupid
and--and--and wildly inappropriate ,
and i don &apos;t know what came over me .
rachel , what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t teach at constance anymore .
what about her conduct ? the photograph ?
the board of directors is concerned
we don &apos;t have sufficient evidence .
and dan himself said
there was nothing going on between them .
ms. carr could sue the school for wrongful termination ,
and no one wants that kind of publicity .
so what does this mean ?
ms. carr will be able to resume her duties
and see out the semester .
i know a few parents won &apos;t be happy ,
but they have to understand it &apos;s for the greater good .
a scandal would hurt everyone .
i &apos;m going to notify ms . carr right now .
i thought as head of the parents &apos; council ,
you &apos;d like to know .
hey , dan , it &apos;s me .
i went to rachel to apologize ,
but i &apos;m not sure it did any good .
i &apos;m really sorry about everything .
i guess i &apos;ll just see you at school tomorrow .
and maybe we can forget
this whole rachel thing ever happened .
one thing is certain on the upper east side--
what goes around ,
comes around .
