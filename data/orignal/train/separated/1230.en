We know who it is. We have a name.
It's Andrew, babe.
Hey, there's another girl down here.
I'm Sara Harvey.
So when do we tell the police about Charles?
We don't.
We don't?
They'll know Andrew is Charles when they find him.
What happened to you?
He just played games with us.
Who do you love more, me or her?
Who deserves water today?
We all want the person who did that to you punished.
It was Andrew. It has to be Andrew.
They're supposed to give me an anti-anxiety medication
to help me sleep.
I asked them not to.
I need that prescription.
No, you want it. There's a difference.
That guy they caught..
Andrew.
Are you sure it's him?
Do we have a Charles DiLaurentis in our family?
No Charles DiLaurentis in this family.
Your father's a liar.
Did she say anything more?
Just that, when she saw Andrew on the news
she didn't think he was the one who kept her down there.
Okay, well, details, Emily?
Did she give you any details? Why is she sure?
She's not sure-sure, just pretty sure.
Was it the way that he walked, or the sound of his breathing?
She didn't say.
Where is she now?
Takin' a shower. She takes a lot of showers.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Spencer, Sara was trapped for over two years.
Andrew was in school with us the whole time.
Yeah, well, Mona was stalking the halls when she was A.
It didn't exactly cramp her style.
Mona didn't have someone caged up like an animal.
Yeah, I know.
You can't exactly ask for a hall pass
to go feed your hostage.
Look, I know, I may have screwed up with the police
but I still think that Andrew is Charles.
I'm just telling you what she said.
Spencer thinks--
It has to be Andrew.
Because if it's not, we're right back where we started
and I-I am not going back there.
Are you going to school?
Hell yes, I'm going to school.
Do you think Mona will be there?
Mona's mom took her out of town.
I think they're in Saratoga.
What about Sara?
What about her?
What she told Emily about Andrew.
He was everywhere, Aria. You said it yourself.
'He managed to be around the corner from so much.'
No, I-I know I've been sayin' it's him..
I'll just see you at school.
I guess so.
No.
No guessing, you have to be there.
I not walking in there alone.
Bye.
Okay, bye.
安德鲁·坎贝尔
So you're going back to school already.
Yeah, there is not that much left.
My mom said she could give you a ride home.
Okay.
Are you okay?
I was wonderin' if I could hang around here for awhile.
Till you got home from school.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll just tell my mom.
Thanks.
Why don't you hold onto this?
In case you wanna talk to someone.
I can't take your phone.
No, it's not mine.
I-it's a burner. My friend gets them for me.
I'll just put my number on speed-dial.
You can text me if you want to.
I guess I'll have to go back...to school.
The only way people know me is from the news.
I saw a story.
They described me as feral.
Did you think I looked feral?
Not feral, um..
...more like a lost puppy.
You just needed some grooming.
Um...I'm sorry.
I-I shouldn't have come here.
I...I should've just toughed it out at home.
Is your mom angry that I came here?
I-I don't want to make your mom angry.
No-no-no, no. No one is angry at you.
I'll tell you what..
...why don't the three of us have breakfast together?
I thought you were going to school.
I-I can go tomorrow.
We have French toast to make this morning.
What's that for?
Comfort food.
Oh, you're a very attentive host.
No, I don't do this for every customer.
Just the ones that order coffee to go and then don't go.
Yeah, I-I just thought that I'd sit here for a minute
before I walk to school.
You and the others are going back today?
Yes.
Are you ready for that?
No.
Then don't go.
Play hooky. You're entitled to.
I don't wanna hide in my house all day.
You can stay here.
You can use the desk in the back.
You can write.
No writing.
You can not write.
You can read, doodle
alphabetize the spice shelf, anything.
You're safe here. I promise.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
I told you what my father said.
You have to ask him again. You have to make him tell you.
He looked at me and said that there was no such person
as Charles DiLaurentis in our family.
Ali, your father is lying to you!
A didn't just pick that name out of the air.
A is for Andrew.
Then why put the name
Charles DiLaurentis right in front of us?
Hidden, but hidden just enough.
Why did he want us to find it?
Look, if this person is real
and my dad knows who it is
he'd be down at the police station right now.
I really wish I was as sure of that as you are.
If you actually are that sure.
I think you should go now.
I'm going to talk to Jason.
No.
Leave him out of it.
He's messed up enough because of all this.
Then he has a right to know and maybe get un-messed.
He's my brother too. Our families are connected.
They're more than just connected they're all tangled up
like necklaces in the bottom of your jewelry box.
Leave him alone.
I don't want anybody else hating me.
What makes you think he's gonna hate you?
Because that's how it works.
I'm under every stone that somebody turns over.
I make people into people that they never were.
It's all my fault.
I saw you and Em and Aria and Hanna in that place
that sick place, and I knew
I was why you were there.
It always comes down to me.
And everyone would be fine without me.
God, Ali, no, it's not like that.
You think it yourself.
No, I don't.
You've reached Spencer. Leave a..
Hanna?
Dr. Sullivan.
I'm so glad to see you here.
I called, did your mother tell you?
Yeah, yeah, she did. That was really nice.
I gave her some names of some people you might wanna talk to.
Thanks.
And you decided to come back to school?
Yeah.
Are the others here?
Uh, not yet. Just me.
Well, I'm here consulting with
the school counselors two days a week.
If you'd like stop by..
Okay.
Please, stop by.
Thanks.
Who are you?
How you doin'?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Good. Uh, here's a tip.
If you don't want somebody knowing
that you're hiding something from them, don't hide it.
Maybe I wasn't really hiding it.
Who is he?
Really?
I trusted him, and all I know is what he told me.
What do you wanna know?
I think the thing that A...
Andrew hated the most was that we were friends.
Aria, Spencer, Emily and me.
Like ruining that was the big win and...
maybe it was.
How?
The dark
the cold, being hungry..
That was bad enough.
But there was something else going on.
'Choose one.'
Hanna, how do you feel about scheduling some time together?
Well, it can't just be me.
I mean, it has to be the four of us.
I can't force the others into a group session.
Well, you're a doctor. Can't you subpoena them?
It doesn't work like that.
But if you can get them all to come to my office
I'll find time for you.
I'll make it happen.
Hi, is-is the doctor available
to talk to the Rosewood Police Department?
Oh, alright.
Please hold for Detective Mervin.
It's the nurse.
Hello, this is Detective Mervin, is this Dr. Fenton?
Oh, no, that's alright, you could help me.
Um, we have a patient here of the doctor's one Andrew Campbell,
we just wanted to check and make sure our information is correct
so that he's properly cared for.
Well, any prescription drugs he should be taking
any medical history that we should to be aware of, um...
Why don't, why don't we start with the basics?
Can you confirm his date and place of birth
and social security number?
Right.
No, that's alright. Um, I understand.
We will contact the parents. Thank you so much.
You didn't get anything, did you?
Can't give out medical information over the phone.
But... as for his date of birth, and where he was born
that information is sealed.
Sealed? Sealed where?
With the rest of his aption records.
Hey, lady.
Can we get our ball back?
Nice kick.
You got great control.
Thank you.
Are those boys all from church?
Not all.
It's a church program, but any kid can join.
Where are the girls?
Co-ed doesn't work well at this age.
They're starting to notice certain distinctions.
So the girls lose out? That's not fair.
Oh, we had a group for girls
but, uh, they lost their youth leader.
Can't have a program without proper supervision.
That's too bad.
Would you like to volunteer?
For what?
To run the girls' soccer program.
You've got the moves.
I'm talking about your kick.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Being a leader of girls
that hasn't worked out well for me.
Maybe that's somethin' you can talk to them about.
There are mothers in this town
who wouldn't appreciate me supervising their daughters.
Why don't you let me worry about them?
You don't take no for an answer, do you?
Not if it can be avoided, no.
Up until by the age of 12
Emily's closet was done in early hurricane.
Then came the glorious day she discovered hangers.
Okay.
It's true.
You're probably just gonna start all over, right?
I mean, clear out your closet and get all new things.
I sort of have to.
Have to?
My mom gave away all my stuff.
Not right away, she..
said she waited a year.
Then she packed it up and gave it away.
Well, it was probably really hard for her
to have all your things around.
She said she needed the space.
You can have whatever fits.
And there's more stuff in the attic.
Yeah, a lot more.
You ran away from home?
Mom.
That's okay.
Yeah, I ran away.
Why?
Just couldn't do it anymore.
Couldn't do what?
Pretend to be happy.
Pretend everything was gonna be okay.
Pretend my dad would come back, and..
he'd be different if he did.
I'm really sorry.
Not your fault.
I'm still sorry. And a little bit angry.
You know what? I think that you should try this one again.
It looks really nice. The color should be good for you.
Thanks.
Hanna, I'm sorry.
I meant to call, I just.. I couldn't make it.
Where are you?
I have to.. I have to ask you a favor.
Name it.
I need you to talk to Ali.
Talk to Ali about what?
About keeping away from Lorenzo.
Your partner? What does he have to do with Alison?
Nothing yet. I wanna keep it that way.
What makes you think Ali's interested in Lorenzo?
I saw them together.
That's his business, isn't it?
His and Ali's.
We're not talking about just anybody here.
We're talking about Alison.
You know, people can change.
She helped you find us.
Right, 'cause she needed you and Mona alive.
She was looking out for Ali, that's what she always does.
So that's it, she just reverts back
to who she was before all this happened?
Look, I wanna trust her, believe me.
But you know she has a history with cops
and anybody else she can use.
Lorenzo doesn't know what she's capable of, we do.
If you can tell me you completely trust her
I'll drop this whole thing.
Come on, get in the car.
I can't. Sara's upstairs.
Em, get in the car. We're gonna go see Dr. Sullivan.
Dr. Sullivan?
Yeah, I'm declaring an intervention.
If you wanna talk to Dr. Sullivan, that's your business.
No, it's all of our business and you know that.
Well, I can't, I have to take care of Sara.
Good, you got the text.
Yeah, I got it. But listen--
Now all we need is Spencer.
No, listen, I got it confirmed.
Andrew Campbell was adopted.
Confirmed? How?
Ezra helped me.
Wait, you didn't tell him about Charles, did you?
No, of course not.
You guys, look, the point is we know for sure.
Andrew was adopted,
which means he might be older than we think he is.
He could be that other kid in the home movie.
Wait, so before he was a Campbell
maybe he was a DiLaurentis.
You probably heard, my dad is trying to decide
how many people he can sue at one time.
It's the kinda challenge he enjoys.
I wanted to talk to you about him.
About your family.
Our family.
Well, I don't think I've ever heard you
refer to it as our family.
Well, things change.
When we were down there in that place, we saw a name.
We found it or
Andrew wanted us to find it.
But either way, we have a name now.
And we don't know what it means.
What name?
Charles DiLaurentis.
We haven't gone to the police yet.
Why not?
'Cause we wanna know what it meant
before we gave it to them.
And Ali asked your dad
but he said that there was no such person.
I don't know any Charles DiLaurentis either.
Not even a cousin somewhere?
Not on our side of the family.
Look, Andrew must have done it just to mess with Ali.
汉娜
I have to go.
See you later.
Charles DiLaurentis?
You do know the name.
Uh, no, not really. It's a coincidence.
What is?
Charlie.
Charlie DiLaurentis?
Just Charlie.
But my dad told you the truth.
About what?
Charlie doesn't exist.
It's nice to see all of you again.
Good to see you.
I'm glad you'll could make it.
I told you we would.
Is Spencer coming?
We don't know.
She'll be here.
Okay, well I've cleared some time
but let me take care of this phone call first.
I'll be just a minute.
Thanks.
So what are we supposed to tell her?
It's not about telling her
it's about telling each other.
Hanna, I think sometimes it's better
not to talk about things.
Really, Em? How have you been sleeping?
Guys, we shouldn't do this without Spencer.
She'll be here.
Are you sure?
You guys, we need to talk.
That's why we're here.
No, I mean we have to talk.
Jason told me who Charles DiLaurentis is.
Wait, so, he knew, but Ali didn't?
Was Alison lying?
It wasn't Charles.
At least not when Jason knew him. It was Charlie.
They were friends when they were little.
So Charlie grew up to be Charles?
Charlie was Jason's imaginary friend.
Imaginary, like Mr. Biscuit?
Long story.
Wait, Jason told you this?
Yes.
And then one day, Mr. DiLaurentis went to Jason
and said that Charlie had to go away.
And then Jason never saw Charlie again.
Wait, wait a minute, so... if Jason's dad
knew that Charlie was Jason's imaginary friend
why wouldn't he just tell Alison that when she asked him?
Yeah, why not?
Wait, so those home movies
those were movies of Jason and Charlie?
There's nothing imaginary about Charles
and Ali's dad knows it.
Yeah, Hanna's right, we have to tell Sullivan everything.
It's Sara. I-I gave her one of Caleb's phones.
Okay, can you please send that to voicemail?
No, it's a face chat request.
Wait.
If that's Sara, who's sending this?
你们只有三十秒的时间离开那里
Yes, I will see you at your session on Tuesday.
Okay.
Where is she?
Hello.
So how are things with Sara?
Emily will explain it to her.
Without telling her what was on the phone?
No, it won't do her any good to scare her with that.
If A is Charles, and Charles is Andrew
and Andrew is in jail, then who made that call?
Who was in the room with Sara?
Did Mr. Biscuit ever make any threatening phone calls?
Leave Mr. Biscuit out of this.
Hi, Mrs. Fields.
Oh, girls.
Where's Em?
She's upstairs with Sara.
Okay. Good.
Is something wrong?
This isn't official but..
I was just at the police station visiting and..
they're gonna release Andrew Campbell.
Release him?
Wait, did he make bail?
He doesn't have to make bail
they're not charging him with anything.
Wh-what do you mean they're not charging him?
Well, I got this secondhand, but..
there's no case.
He has an alibi for when Mona was taken from her house.
And he was having his appendix removed the weekend
Sara Harvey was kidnapped.
So if they don't think that he did it..
Then that person is still out there.
And you girls need to take precautions.
When was Andrew released?
He hasn't been yet.
They still have to process him and wait for his family.
'He should be out in a few hours.'
You girls need to check in with your parents and..
let 'em know what's happening.
Yeah, we will.
Okay.
Why did you ask when Andrew was released?
Because, if he was out, he could've made that call.
Well, he wasn't. So now what?
Do you have any ideas how crazy that sounds?
Trust me, we know exactly how crazy it sounds.
Jason never told you anything about Charlie?
No.
He said your dad knows all about it.
Your dad was the one who told Jason
that Charlie had to go away.
Ali, your dad lied to you.
Jason always said that something was missing from this family.
I always thought that he was talking about himself..
being left out of things like photo albums.
But maybe he wasn't the one that was removed.
Ali, do you think there could be proof
of Charles DiLaurentis in this house?
Guys, we've been through this house with a map.
Yeah, but we weren't looking for Charlie.
You were looking for my hiding places, not my parents.
There's nothing in here either.
Come with me.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It was very rude and we're all very sorry.
But we had these emergencies come up.
No, I understand if it was an emergency.
But you all had emergencies?
No.
No, we all had the same emergency.
My mom slipped in the shower.
We think it was the soap.
Is she alright?
Yeah, she's fine.
Tempest in a tea bag.
Do you girls wanna make another appointment?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
If we don't find anything here, we'll look in the garden.
Starting with the azaleas.
Really?
Where do you hide things, Spence?
Under your mattress, in that big barn of yours?
No, I have a...loose floorboard in my closet.
That's always good.
Yeah.
Toby is not gonna like this.
Why not?
He thought you were safe so he could go back to hating me.
He doesn't hate you.
Have you met his new partner?
Lorenzo?
No, not yet.
He's nice.
Yeah, Toby likes him.
Toby must have...told him all about me.
Just as well.
What's that supposed to mean?
Has Toby talked to Lorenzo about me?
I don't know.
Where did you meet him?
Lorenzo?
Toby was with him.
And then I saw him again...at church.
Don't laugh.
I'm not laughing.
I'm just.. I'm a little bit surprised.
It's pointless, right?
Me with somebody like that.
I mean, that could never go anywhere.
Could it?
Where would you want it to go?
You know, Ali, there's a version of this
where we could've all been killed.
But we weren't. So it's like a second chance.
And I don't know anybody who couldn't use one of those.
As long as we don't waste it.
That's the same place in the home movie.
The one in the dollhouse.
So one of those boys is Jason.
And the other one's Charlie.
The boy who never was.
You're smart, Aria.
I never would have thought to look in the button jar.
Yeah, well, it's where I used to hide my candy money
from Mike.
My dad's gonna be home soon.
You should probably go.
Maybe we shouldn't leave you alone right now.
No, it'll be okay.
I'll find out what all this means and then I'll call you.
Let's go.
Someone should stay with her.
She has to do this alone.
Her dad wasn't gonna say anything in front of us.
Oh, God.
I guess they processed him.
Aria, maybe you shouldn't.
Andrew.
Stay away from me.
Are your parents inside?
They called them.
I wasn't staying in there to wait.
Look, I'm really glad you're out.
Really? That's not what I heard.
You have to understand--
No, you have to understand.
Do you know where I was, the three weeks
they were trying to find me?
Looking for you.
I was gonna be the hero.
Instead I get arrested, thrown in jail.
They investigated parents, tear up my uncle's farm
because I wanted to help you.
Because I didn't believe what people said
about you and your friends.
Just let me explain...
Don't.
Just don't.
We graduate in three weeks.
All you have to do is stay out of my way.
You'll graduate..
that doesn't mean we will.
Oh, you'll graduate.
The school wants you gone as much as the rest of us.
You'll graduate with honors.
Andrew, you need a lift?
Like I'm getting in a car with you two.
No, thank you.
Other towns have nice toxic dumps.
Rosewood has you.
So I guess you heard him.
We heard.
We're just gonna go check in, then we can drive you home.
Thanks.
Hey. Are you Lorenzo?
Yeah, I'm Lorenzo.
I'm Spencer.
I figured that's who you were.
Uh, this is Aria, Emily and Hanna.
We're Alison's friends.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
Come on.
Andrew's not gonna blame you forever.
Why not? It's my fault.
He was set up.
It wasn't just Andrew, we all were.
Hmm. Worse than ever.
People actually know what happened
but they don't believe us, do they?
Now we're more cut-off than ever.
That's what Charles really wanted to do
to us in that dollhouse...
make us feel alone forever.
Isolated.
When I was in that place..
Charlie, Charles, whoever it was..
he made me play a game..
with switches.
About hurting people.
I thought that I was the only one.
But I, I was never shocked.
Were any of you ever shocked?
No.
He tricked us.
The point was that we thought we hurt each other.
That was what Charles really wanted us to know.
That there was a point that we would do it.
Any of us.
All of us.
It doesn't look that bad, does it?
Your mom helped.
We were talkin' and one thing lead to another.
What do you think?
I called you.
Toby gave me a ride home
in the back of his police car, okay?
All safe and sound.
Andrew Campbell's been released.
Charges dropped.
I know.
The police patrols will be coming back for protection.
But I-I don't want you going anywhere
without me knowing where you are.
I think I'm gonna try to sleep on my own tonight.
Apparently, when they questioned Andrew
he said a few things about you and the other girls.
How you all tricked him into helping you.
I bet the police loved that story.
Is it true?
It's made up of facts..
that doesn't make it true.
How was it..
going back to school?
Don't do that.
Don't do what?
Don't try to catch me in a lie, it's humiliating.
I am trying to keep you safe.
If it wasn't Andrew, then, that means whoever did this to you
is still out there, is still a threat.
God, I wanna put an end to this whole thing
once and for all.
I don't think you wanna put an end to this
so much as you wish it never happened.
Well, it did happen.
It happened to me, and it happened to my friends
and that is not something that gets forgotten. Ever.
You know, when I was down there, I just..
I kept thinking, if we could just make it out
if we could just survive, and get out and come back home
then everything was gonna be alright.
And then, we did.
We're back.
And I don't see a happy ending coming anytime soon.
I really wish I did.
Goodnight, mom.
What's the matter?
We have some questions
and we want answers, not lies.
Don't talk to me like that.
Not after what you've put this family through.
What I've done?
Jason, you don't understand.
Stop.
You're not gonna get out of this
by picking a fight with Jason.
It's not gonna work. Not this time.
I am not gonna be interrogated in my own house by you two.
Who is the other boy in this photo?
