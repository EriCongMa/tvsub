with a concussion and a shrapnel wound in your arm .
this is no way for a war hero to live .

it &apos;s an outreach center dedicated to help vets land on their feet .
welcome home , marine .
my son thomas and his wife
live on the other side of those hills .
the son you haven &apos;t spoken to in a while ?
19 years .
i got a grandson .

and then we &apos;ll head up to the lake on monday .
yeah , me , too . can &apos;t wait .
rossi , i &apos;m from the south side of chicago , ok ?
we don &apos;t have fishing ponds .
how can something look so easy ...
and be so hard ?
it &apos;s all in your technique ,
and all those muscles of yours won &apos;t help in something like this .
it &apos;s all in the wrist .
oh , the wrist .
yeah , yeah .
all right , all right , ok , here we go . and ...
there we go ! that &apos;s what i &apos;m talkin &apos; about ! all right !
yeah , boy !
see , all you need is a little garlic butter
and a 2008 well @-@ chilled bottle of pouilly fuisse .
ok , and maybe a ...
little meat tenderizer wouldn &apos;t hurt .
wow , david rossi ...
taking time to smell the roses .
you know , this daughter thing might be paying dividends .
all i &apos;ll be smelling is fish guts for the next couple of days ,
but you are absolutely right .
hey , look , that &apos;s the first fish i ever caught .
give me that . you enjoy yourself .
alrighty .
sir , is your phone not working ?
i shut it off . this vacation is completely unplugged .
no work phone , no laptop ...
what &apos;s wrong , penelope ?
it &apos;s new directions for veterans in california .
they tried to call you , but you ...
this is david rossi .
i see .
well , i appreciate you letting me know .
i &apos;ll be out there later today .
harrison scott died last night .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
bone cancer . he never even said a word .
i will , uh , be going to los angeles
before heading up to san francisco ,
see if i can be of any help .
sir , if there &apos;s anything i can do ...
well , i would appreciate it , penelope ,
if , uh , you don &apos;t tell the rest of the team about this ,
not just yet .
of course . whatever you want .
so , now hotch as well will not be joining us today .
what &apos;s up with hotch ? he taking a vacation , too ?
no . he is going to meet you at the airport ,
and actually , rossi--
that doesn &apos;t matter .
uh , i am here to present the case .
3 nights ago , in tallahassee , florida ,
a woman named betty wright
was found shot in front of carter memorial hospital .
she &apos;s currently brain dead . she &apos;s on life support .
her vehicle was found 10 miles from the location .
looks like she &apos;d been in an accident .
do we think the killer engineered the crash ?
that is unlikely . it appears to be a single @-@ car spinout .
so the unsub happened upon the accident by chance
and was taking her to the hospital .
where a rescue mission somehow turned into an execution .
unfortunately , there is more ,
because yesterday afternoon , also in tallahassee ,
cliff daniels , 38 , was found
bludgeoned and shot to death on the steps of a church ,
and ballistics confirm
that the gun was the same in both shootings .
he leaves his victims on the doorsteps of places
we think of as a sanctuary-- church , hospital .
only to snatch away hope at the last minute .
maybe we &apos;re dealing with a sadist ?
whatever the reason ,
this unsub &apos;s killed twice in less than 48 hours .
let &apos;s get going .
911 . please state your emergency .
there &apos;s been a shooting .
what is your location , sir ?
the corner of hazel and parkway .
sir , if you could just remain--
&quot; death is the only god who comes when you call . &quot;
roger zelazny .
both victims were black ,
but the similarities begin and end right there .
betty wright was a well @-@ liked tallahassee native ,
pillar of the community .
cliff daniels , on the other hand , was a shady character
from new jersey who moved to florida 3 months ago .
yeah , and not for the sunshine .
a ponzi scheme he &apos;d been running back east imploded .
maybe one of the investors who got burned
came back to florida for revenge .
it doesn &apos;t explain betty wright &apos;s murder .
you know , i would love one day
to interrupt you on the jet to report
that a stray puppy was found and saved and given the best home ever .
but it &apos;s not gonna be today ,
because there &apos;s been another shooting . victor hall .
is he black ?
nope . white .
at least that might eliminate race as a motive .
there was a witness this time ,
peter goodwin , the victim &apos;s shrink .
they &apos;d just finished a session together .
all right , reid and kate , go to the medical examiner .
morgan , you and jj
talk to betty wright &apos;s family at the hospital .
i &apos;ll talk to this new witness and see if he can shed some light .
victor had been in therapy with me for nearly 3 years .
and he gave no indication that he might be in danger ?
no , not at all .
he &apos;d been going through a lot recently .
marriage problems .
a son with drug issues .
and then about two weeks ago ,
he was mugged and robbed .
but this--gunned down in the streets ...
how did you witness the shooting ?
it was the end of our session .
i was tired . i needed a boost .
there &apos;s a coffee place down the street .
it was a quiet time of day .
i was checking messages on my cell phone ,
and i just turned around and saw victor .
and where was he ?
at the other end of the block .
there was a man walking up fast behind him .
can you describe this person ?
white guy . maybe late 40s , early 50s .
he hit victor across the back of the head .
what did you do ?
i just froze .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t believe what i was seeing .
and then i took off to try and help .
what happened next ?
the guy crouched down . that &apos;s when i saw the gun .
he pointed it at victor &apos;s head .
that &apos;s when i heard the gunshot .
and then the guy took off across the street .
did he take off on foot or did he get into a car ?
he got into a car .
a gold car .
i didn &apos;t get the make or model .
you said that he was crouched down over victor .
yeah . it was like he was looking
for the right place to shoot him .
what do you mean by that ?
well , he was moving the gun around on victor &apos;s head ,
looking for an angle .
he wasn &apos;t taking direct aim .
you said you were checking your cell phone
and then you looked back at victor .
was there anything that made you turn around and look ?
something you saw or heard ?
no special reason . i just looked around .
put yourself back in the moment .
think carefully .
i heard sirens approaching .
so you heard police sirens before the actual shooting ?
yes .
but that can &apos;t be , can it ?
i mean , how could the police be responding
to something that hadn &apos;t happened yet ?
i &apos;ll stay and help however i can and then come up ,
two or three days max .
don &apos;t worry about it .
the lake isn &apos;t gonna dry up all of a sudden .
just take all the time you need .
you sure ?
yes , absolutely . we &apos;re gonna be fine , dad .
you there ?
i--i &apos;m sorry . whenever i hear someone say &quot; dad , &quot;
i start looking around to see who they &apos;re talking to .
well , get used to it ... dad .
i &apos;ll call you tonight .
ok .
i appreciate you coming on such short notice , mr. rossi .
it was a pleasure and a privilege
to have known sergeant scott .
he &apos;ll be missed .
yes , he will .
these boxes were harrison &apos;s .
his son thomas said if you want to start going through them ,
it &apos;s all right with him . he should be here soon .
thank you .
so the gunshot didn &apos;t kill daniels .
that &apos;s right . bullet just grazed the skull .
c.o.d. was actually from the blunt force trauma to the head .
could you determine the murder weapon ?
no , but there were minute traces of metal flecks in the scalp .
my guess would be a tire iron , metal pipe , something like that .
how long had daniels been dead when
he was discovered at the church ?
i &apos;d say 5 @-@ 6 hours .
as head trauma goes , i &apos;ve seen a lot worse .
two moderate blows to the temple , like the killer was weak .
or he restrained himself .
is there such a thing as underkill ?
there was with this victim .
if the unsub did hold back ,
i wonder why .
my wife ...
she lit up any room she walked into .
now look at her .
these damn machines have got more life in them than she does .
mr. wright , was betty carrying anything valuable
the night of her accident ? cash , expensive jewelry ?
no . why ?
we think the man who shot your wife
was initially bringing her here for treatment ,
but something changed his mind .
no .
betty didn &apos;t have anything special with her that night .
mr. wright ?
we &apos;re ready for you .
got papers to sign .
you think you have years left with someone ...
all the time in the world .
and suddenly you don &apos;t .
still sittin &apos; on your ass , rossi ?
it wasn &apos;t my idea , sergeant .
got something for you .
i had to bribe colson a 6 @-@ pack to make this happen .
but ...
i wanted to make it personal .
i &apos;m proud of you .
not just for what you did here ,
but what you &apos;re going to do in the future .
i expect great things .
thank you , sergeant .
i need to heal up first , though .
and when you do , remember ,
scars only show us where we &apos;ve been ,
they do not dictate where we are going .
mr. rossi .
thomas .
when did you get in ?
last night .
had you known your dad had been sick ?
he told me a couple months ago
when it was obvious something was wrong .
he made me promise not to tell anyone .
especially you .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , don &apos;t be .
harrison had his own way of doing things .
yeah . stubborn .
i prefer to say ...
sure of himself .
it &apos;s what made him a great leader .
but dad knew he was dying for over a year ,
even before you came out last time .
that explains his urgency to reconnect with you ,
get to know may , meet his grandson .
the funeral-- it &apos;s the day after tomorrow .
i &apos;m not even sure what i &apos;m supposed to do .
if you don &apos;t mind , thomas ,
as a fellow marine ,
i &apos;d like to take care of it .
are you sure ?
absolutely .
it would be my honor .
those his ?
yeah .
so , uh , which one &apos;s you ?
uh , that would be the handsome one right there .
the last couple of months ,
my dad &apos;s been trying to reconnect with these men
who served under him in vietnam .
did he have any luck ?
no , too much time has passed .
people are hard to find .
well , let me help you pack these things up .
mr. rossi .
thank you again
for giving me the time i did have with my father .
police are saying victor hall
was pronounced dead at the scene .
tonight , friends and family of the victim are asking ...
why did you let him die ?
you were right there !
dad ?
are you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just ...
the news .
whole world is going to hell .
it &apos;s not healthy for you to sit
back here all the time in the dark .
did you get your medicine ?
this morning .
i &apos;m sorry .
about what ?
all those bad years i put you and mom through .
the drugs , the everything .
it &apos;s in the past .
i just wish your mother was here to see you now .
the real you .
timmy &apos;s happy .
he wasn &apos;t like this before we moved back home .
you are a lifeline for him .
for both of us .
everything &apos;s gonna be ok , dad .
it &apos;s all gonna work out .
mommy ?
ok , so the 911 call on victor hall &apos;s murder
came in at 10 : 37 a.m. ,
police were on the scene at 10 : 42,
only moments after the shooting .
so the killer himself made the call .
he alerted the police before shooting victor .
it &apos;s like he was leaving open the chance for rescue ,
the way he did with betty wright .
he &apos;s being careful . the call came from a disposable cell phone
so it couldn &apos;t be traced .
hotch also said he was careful to place the bullet
so it penetrated the skull at an angle .
mimics the restrained nature of the head trauma to cliff daniels .
garcia said she couldn &apos;t find a shred of connective tissue
between any of the victims .
so far , the unsub staged his murders in front of a hospital ,
a church , and a psychiatrist &apos;s office .
he could be making a statement about body , mind , and soul .
no , no , no . to me it feels like he &apos;s re @-@ enacting ,
playing out versions
of a near @-@ miss that happened to him or a loved one .
or he &apos;s an adrenaline junkie .
killing isn &apos;t exciting unless he &apos;s walking
that raggedy edge of being caught .
ok , so let &apos;s catch him .
911 . what is your emergency ?
listen . there &apos;s a burglary in progress
at 24481 crescent circle drive .
i think someone inside &apos;s been hurt .
damn it !
who the hell are you ?
you should have stayed asleep .
small @-@ caliber weapon
and a heads @-@ up 911 call before it happened .
this has to be our guy .
yeah , and he didn &apos;t hold back this time .
first shot was at medium range , the rest were pointblank .
the victim had been drinking .
enough painkillers to start his own pharmacy .
what is it , garcia ?
i have a very interesting tidbit
regarding the church daniels was found at .
they have a very popular sunrise service
there every morning , no exception ,
except for the exception
that happened on the day daniels was found there .
the pastor had a death in the family .
he had to cancel the service last @-@ minute .
all right , thanks .
the unsub must have known about the sunrise service .
he was expecting daniels &apos; body to be found right away .
so the first two victims
were placed where they &apos;d be found quickly ,
and the next two victims weren &apos;t shot
until the unsub made sure that help was on the way .
what &apos;s that about ?
dad .
this is keith , the one i told you about .
from my group .
oh , right . right . keith .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s all right , sir . it &apos;s just nice to meet you .
he just came by the visit , borrow a couple books .
ok , well , i &apos;m glad that you two could finally meet .
voice recognition confirms
the same person made both 911 calls .
so the only consistency in all 4 shootings
is the near rescue component .
what &apos;s this guy doing , daring us to catch him ?
no , i think he genuinely wants his victims to survive .
well , not the latest victim .
crawford took one bullet to the head and 5 to the chest .
crawford &apos;s the exception . when the unsub got inside ,
he noticed the severity of crawford &apos;s substance abuse .
which made him unworthy of being saved ?
unworthy , unsuitable .
we need to look at the betty wright surveillance video again .
this is where the spree started it .
the question is , what triggered it ?
it doesn &apos;t look premeditated ,
but he did have a gun .
well , this is stand your ground florida .
lots of citizens ride around with weapons .
up to this point , he still looks like a good samaritan .
all right , rewind it to the point
where he puts her up against the tree
and then play it back in slow @-@ motion .
right there .
his body language changes .
he saw something .
mm @-@ hmm . can you zoom in on her ?
is she wearing a bracelet ?
garcia , you said that betty wright
had been taken off life support , yes ?
yeah . she passed away two hours ago .
but she hasn &apos;t been transferred to the m.e. yet , has she ?
i don &apos;t know how you know that , but no , she hasn &apos;t .
if you give me a nanosecond
i will tell you why that is .
it &apos;s because--
it &apos;s because her organs are being recovered .
her organs are being recovered .
sir , you frequently amaze me a little ,
but sometimes you amaze me a lot .
that &apos;s right . betty wright was wearing a medic alert bracelet
identifying her as an organ donor .
garcia , were any of the other victims organ donors ?
let me see . uh ...
yes , yes , and ...
yes .
every one .
we believe we &apos;re looking for a white male
in his early to mid 50s .
he appears to be engineering murder scenarios
so the victims can be attended to quickly enough
to have their organs recovered .
all the victims are registered organ donors .
with betty wright ,
he saw her medic alert bracelet .
we don &apos;t know how he learned about the others yet .
he may need an organ for himself or a loved one ,
but because of the scarcity of available organs ,
he could be taking matters into his own hands .
if the supply is low , he &apos;ll create supply .
now , with the latest victim , the killer made a mistake .
dale crawford had serious alcohol and drug issues .
this would have compromised his vital organs
and made him a poor candidate for a transplant .
when the killer realized the mistake he made with crawford ,
the punishment was cold @-@ blooded murder .
it is possible that this setback with crawford
will actually accelerate the unsub &apos;s kills
and make him more dangerous .
thank you .
hello ?
hi , dr. urman .
yes .
no , i understand .
thank you for letting me know .
i will .
the liver went to somebody else .
it &apos;s not fair .
dad , there &apos;s lots of people in my position ,
and some of them are even sicker than i am .
like keith .
and they &apos;re ahead of me on the waiting list .
that &apos;s just how it is .
how it is does not make it right !
i &apos;m close , though .
dr. urman said a call could come at any time .
you can &apos;t give up hope .
i won &apos;t .
i won &apos;t .
yeah , the doctor sounded really hopeful .
we won &apos;t know for certain till sometime tomorrow , but ...
i know . that &apos;s why i packed an overnight kit today .
yeah .
penelope ?
hello , sir , how are you ?
i &apos;m doing ok . how are things there ?
oh , good . uh , one small thing .
derek called and he asked how many fish you caught
and i covered for you like you asked .
but you know how sometimes my face does that weird twisty thing
when i &apos;m telling a lie and i try to--
garcia .
yes ?
i spoke to hotch earlier today about harrison .
he &apos;s going to fill in the rest of the team .
ok . that &apos;s a relief .
actually , i called to ask a favor .
yeah , anything . what ?
be honest with me . if you &apos;re too busy ...
no , i &apos;m not . i swear .
you can &apos;t see , but my face isn &apos;t doing
that twisty thing at all . what do you need ?
it &apos;s nearly impossible to narrow down the unsub &apos;s hunting ground .
i mean , any cashier who asked a customer
for their driver &apos;s license
is gonna know that they &apos;re an organ donor .
garcia &apos;s checking to see if all of our victims intersected
at any retail establishments .
on top of that ,
the north florida organ procurement center
is located right here in tallahassee
and their employees would know friends , family .
not to mention online donor registration .
anyone with even marginal computer skills
could access the database .
we &apos;ve got another one .
keith doheny . a jogger found him like this .
was there a 911 call beforehand ?
nothing .
oxygen concentrator . if he &apos;s not in good health ,
he &apos;s not exactly a good candidate for donating organs .
you know , the victim &apos;s severely jaundiced .
he himself could be in the final stages of liver failure .
so maybe that &apos;s it .
maybe he &apos;s not giving organs , he &apos;s in need of one .
you are right on the dinero .
keith doheny has been waiting for a liver transplant
since last november .
what &apos;s his meld score ?
his what what ?
model for end @-@ stage liver disease .
it &apos;s a point system the united network for organ sharing
uses to determine those most in need .
it &apos;s high .
like right there at the top .
ok , so if the other murders were about creating supply ,
maybe now he &apos;s eliminating demand ?
which means the unsub isn &apos;t dispersing organs randomly .
he &apos;s trying to help one specific person .
one way to do that , whittle down the competition .
estelle ?
estelle ?
where are you ?
grandpa !
timmy , what &apos;s the matter ?
something &apos;s wrong with mommy .
estelle !
estelle !
garcia &apos;s checking the waiting lists for liver transplants .
someone &apos;s going to benefit from keith doheny &apos;s death .
since the blood types of the victims are varied ,
have her only look at the universal recipient , ab @-@ positive .
you know , if the unsub needs the organ for a loved one ,
he probably already tried to make a living donation himself .
the liver has the greatest regenerative capacity
of any organ in the human body
and a transplanted portion from a living donor
will grow to full size in a couple of weeks .
have garcia get names of people
who applied to be living donors but were rejected .
ok , identifying donors is one thing ,
but finding out who was on a recipient waiting list
is next to impossible . how did the unsub manage it ?
we need to look at keith doheny &apos;s circle of friends .
support groups , doctors and nurses ,
anyone who might be familiar with his circumstances .
how is she ?
estelle is resting comfortably .
that doesn &apos;t tell me a damn thing !
is she gonna be ok ?
frank , we &apos;ve always known the situation .
time is running out .
as in what ?
hours ?
days ?
weeks , hopefully .
but not months .
no , frank , not months .
but there &apos;s always hope that another liver will come available .
as difficult as it sounds ,
it &apos;s best to try to resume your normal life in the meantime .
dad .
dad .
wow , i really do need to re @-@ educate you about this dad business .
wh @-@ what are-- what are you doing here ?
there are times when families should be together ,
and this seemed like one of those times .
what--how did you know to find me here ?
l.a. &apos; s a big city .
remember that &quot; find your friend &quot; app i put on your cell phone ?
it put you directly in front of new directions for veterans .
well , i &apos;m glad you came .
it &apos;s nice to see your face .
so what were you thinking about just now ?
you seemed far away .
my last real conversation with harrison
was right on this bench .
conversation about what ?
about what a screw @-@ up i was when i enlisted .
i was a real hothead back then .
i didn &apos;t have a clue .
it &apos;s hard to picture you like that .
oh , picture it , trust me .
but sergeant harrison scott straightened me out .
before him ,
i was on a fast train to nowhere .
sounds like my mother
wouldn &apos;t have given the old david rossi the time of day .
oh , god , no , not in a million years .
well , then i guess you could say
that since harrison scott made you and my mom possible ...
he sort of made me possible .
yeah . i guess you could .
hey . how about some lunch ?
i know a great italian place on pico ,
and they play nothing but tony bennett .
yeah , sounds great .
i &apos;m not very familiar with tony bennett ,
but if you like him , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s ok .
ok ? tony bennett ? ok ?
obviously , my dear ,
this re @-@ education thing is going to be a two @-@ way street .
all right , thanks , baby girl .
let me know if you find anything .
garcia &apos;s not having much luck with the recipients .
hotch ?
maybe we need to go back and focus again on how the unsub
knew that the first 4 victims were organ donors .
we &apos;ve been down that road . it &apos;s a cast of thousands .
it includes every employee
of every retail establishment in the area .
dale crawford , the substance abuser ,
you have his file ?
yeah .
temporary driver &apos;s license . it only expired a month ago .
ok , so what are you thinking ?
cliff daniels , the victim who was found in the church ,
recently moved from florida to new jersey ,
and victor hall had his wallet stolen .
meaning he would have to have his driver &apos;s license replaced .
and daniels would have to trade
in his new jersey license for a florida one .
the dmv .
is that it , then ?
hey , i said , am i done here or what ?
yes , i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re done .
like i got nothin &apos; else to do all day .
next .
hey , talk to me , mama .
frank cosgrove works at the dmv branch
smack dab in the middle of the geo zone where our victim lived .
he has a daughter estelle , blood type ab @-@ positive ,
who &apos;s on the recipient list for a liver transplant .
she goes to a support group
attended by a keith doheny .
frank cosgrove did indeed try to make a living donation
6 months ago , but he was medically rejected
due to high blood pressure .
it there is an unsub box
that hasn &apos;t been checked , i &apos;m not finding it .
an address , garcia .
work and home on its way .
it &apos;s not necessary to smile .
you &apos;ll receive your license in 3 to 5 weeks .
thank you .
the dmv where frank cosgrove works is nearby .
we &apos;re trying to confirm he &apos;s there today .
if everyone could just wait a minute or two ,
we &apos;ll take care of you .
janice , there &apos;s a call for you .
it &apos;s the fbi .
can i help you ?
is frank cosgrove working today ?
yeah , but he just took off right in the middle of a shift .
ok , do you know who the last customer is he served ?
it looks like it was a woman named carol murray . why ?
ok , this is important .
does it say anywhere that she &apos;s an organ donor ?
yes , she is .
no , i just finished with the dmv
and now i &apos;m heading to the store .
what do you and the kids feel like for dinner ?
come on . come on , pick up .
have the operator break in .
well , you &apos;ll just have to wait and see .
that &apos;s the fun of it .
there &apos;s an emergency call trying to get through .
please clear the line .
oh , my god , greg , i have to hang up .
hello ?
carol murray ?
yes . who is this ?
this is agent jareau and agent morgan with the fbi ,
and i need you to stay calm and listen to me carefully .
fbi ?
ma &apos;am , where are you ?
i &apos;m outside the dmv . what &apos;s going on ?
ok , carol , i need you to walk back into the dmv
as if nothing is wrong .
ok .
just stay right there .
carol ?
carol , are you there ?
oh , please don &apos;t hurt me .
please !
quiet .
frank cosgrove , fbi !
drop that weapon , put your hands in the air .
one step and i &apos;ll shoot her .
we know about your daughter .
this is not the solution .
keep estelle out of this !
she &apos;s 23 years old .
a mother . she deserves to live .
the woman you &apos;re holding is also a mother .
frank , you don &apos;t want this to be your legacy .
estelle wouldn &apos;t want this . you know she wouldn &apos;t .
drop the weapon .
forgive me .
where am i ?
you &apos;re going into surgery , estelle .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
my wife . they said she was in a shooting .
i &apos;m sorry , sir , what is your name ?
greg murray .
the police said she &apos;d been taken to the hospital , and i --
mr. murray ?
oh , thank god .
frank , you don &apos;t want this to be your legacy .
estelle wouldn &apos;t want this . you know she wouldn &apos;t .
drop the weapon .
forgive me .
yeah , that &apos;s great .
ok , thank you .
estelle &apos;s transplant was a success .
do you think she &apos;ll ever
find out that she has her father &apos;s liver ?
well , the directive that was in cosgrove &apos;s desk
said that the donor would remain anonymous .
she &apos;s gonna know he was a killer , though ,
and why he was doing it . the math can &apos;t be that hard .
no , but as we know ,
there &apos;s some truths the brain refuses to process .
i wonder how rossi &apos;s doing .
this is more than i was expecting .
every marine is entitled to a funeral with full honors .
you just have to ask .
plus a couple of 3 @-@ stars from my cigar club in d.c.
wanted to fly in to be part of this .
and them ?
those gentlemen are who are left
from your father &apos;s squad in vietnam .
how &apos;d you find them so quickly ?
someday i &apos;ll introduce you to one penelope garcia .
flag !
on behalf of the president of the united states ,
the commandant of the marine corps ,
and a grateful nation ,
please accept this flag as a token
of our appreciation
for your loved one &apos;s service to country and corps .
&quot; as life runs on ,
the road grows strange with faces new
and near the end , the milestones into headstones change ,
&apos;neath every one a friend . &quot;
