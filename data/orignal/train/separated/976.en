Desperate Housewives S06 E09
Gaby discovered a secret
Your stomache just kicked me
I want you to run the Miami office.
So, Carlos played hardball.
You can't fire me for being pregnant.
I'm offering a promotion.
If you choose to turn it down and quit instead,
I can't stop you
Katherine broke down.
The man I love chose you. It's over.
Why it's been so hard on me?
You loved him.
I found a way to spring you from this marriage
Karl had a plan
If he violates the parole by
Associating with a known felon, they can revoke it.
All we need to do is
get some ex-con in a room with Orson
Take some pictures and it's bye bye, Orson
It's perfect! And he will have to let me go
Nick made a call.
Agent Padilla? I am thinking about coming in.
And evil
Did you forget something?
Return to the neighborhood
What are you doing?
Her name Was Emily Portsmith.
And the word of her death spread quickly.
You see, everyone in town knew Emily.
Her family was well-known and respected
She'd been popular in school...
And her customers at the coffee shop adored her.
People were shocked to hear she'd been murdered.
Mostly because
Another young woman was attacked just a few weeks before.
Yes, everyone in Fairview now knew
A killer is walking among them.
And they would soon learn...
He wasn't finished.
The next day, the woman of Wisteria Lane
got togehther for their weekly poker game.
But as it turned out,
No one is in the mood to gamble.
The girl in the coffee shop was strangled
and Julie was attacked in the same way.
There is obviously a mad man on the loose.
I am afraid to leave my house at night.
At least now you have a boyfriend to protect you.
Roy? The man threw out his back peeling an orange.
I am on my own here.
So what we do to protect ourselves?
Down at the hospital where I work,
They offer a self-defense class.
Maybe we should consider taking that.
That's a good idea.
I guess we could.
But you know my motto. .38 special is a girl's best friend.
Ohh, I love the pearl handle.
It would look so good with my white suit.
Susan, you should feel it. It's so light.
I don't touch guns anymore. Not since
I accidently grazed Katherine.
Still go with "accidently," are we?
Oh, hey, honey, we are all gonna take a self-defense class.
Are you coming with us?
Yeah, it might make you feel safer
Well, I was taking out the trash when I was attacked.
He came out of nowhere.
And I blacked out before I knew what was happening.
If someone really wants to get you,
They can get you.
I am off. You're still sewing Penny's costume?
Yeah, but I am reading the sports page while I am doing it.
So they kinda cancel each other out.
Oh...Ahem, I got you this... A pricy Bourbon.
It's 8:45 in the morning and I am pregnant.
I think I will pass.
For Carlos. It's a sorry-I-lied-about-being-pregnant gift.
I don't need that. I know Carlos.
He loses his temper. Then, he calms down
and thinks rationally. Good-bye.
I'd still bring the booze.
I am telling you. I am too valuable right where I am.
There is no way he's gonna try to send me to Florida.
Bon Voyage!
What's going on?
Carlos told us about the promotion in Florida. Congradulations!
You're gonna be so missed around here.
Lynette, where are you going? Rita wrote you a good-bye poem.
Can I see you in my office please?
What are you thinking you are doing? You know I am not moving to Florida.
Okay, so we just change the bannner to read "Good luck and so long"
No, it needs to read "I told you I am not leaving.
Someone get me a bagel."
Lynette, what can I tell you?
We have an opening for you in Florida branch.
But here you job is already been given to Tim.
Tell Tim you made a mistake.
I can't do that.
So I guess this leaves you no choice but to quit.
Look, I know what you are doing. And I am not going for it.
You wanna me gone. You are gonna have to fire me.
And open myself to a lawsuit by firing a pregnant woman?
I don't think so.
Then if you don't mind, I have work to do.
Hey, these aren't my kids.
No, those are Tim's kids.
This is his office now.
So...what office will I be using
Are you kidding me? These twins have a bigger office.
Enjoy
How you doing?
I am Okay.
Everybody seems to think whoever killed Emily
Was probably the same person who attacked me.
Yeah, that's what plice are saying.
And I think we should do everything we can to help them.
Meaning what?
Maybe now it's the time to tell them the married man you were seeing.
He has nothing to do with it.
You don't know that. Man who cheats sometimes have
More than one girlfriend.
Mom, listen,
There is no way he could ever hurt someone, much less kill them.
Okay
If you're sure.
I am
I mean...why would he attack me
and then wanna get back together
Wait. Have you started seeing him again?
No.
Julie.
Even if I did, it is my life, right?
That's right. It is your life.
Is it just me or was life
Much less complicated when you were seven?
Sorry I grew up
Me too
Police are concerned that the strangling
of Portsmith is connected to a similar attact
on a fairview woman earlier this year
Anyone with information is been asked to call
Just think... If the cops hadn't wasted
so much time on Danny
They might have got this guy
before he did this again, right?
What?
I was there.
You were where?
The coffee shop
I got there right when the girl was clsoing up.
Oh please be kidding.
Nah, I wish I was.
And I'm pretty sure I was the last customer.
But did anybody see you?
No, I don't think so.
But that doesn't mean the cops
won't figure out that I was there
And if they do...
Yeah they're gonna wanna come
and talk to you again and... maybe run you prints.
Yeah. That's what I was thinking.
I was also thinking that maybe we shouldn't
Wait around for that to happen
No. I'm not moving again, not this time
Look, angie... ange... ange, will you just let me finish?
No, no, no, nick, I like this place!
I have friends, I have a job.
I...I feel like a real person here again.
After 18 years of being a ghost, I don't wanna give that up
Fine
All right, maybe We'll get lucky and the cops just won't come
But honestly, I don't know how much more luck we got left.
Hello, are you Lamar Benjamin?
You got a warrant?
Oh no, I'm not with the police
My name is Bree Hodge. You know my husband
Orson from the state penitentiary
Do you have a moment?
I got nothing but moment
So you are Mrs. Hodge.
Damn, Flossy did OK for himself
Floosy?
That's how we called Orson
'cause he got us all dental floss.
And then nagged us to use it every meal
I see
Pain in the ass
I was glad when someone used it to
strangle a guy and then they took it all away
So how's Orson doing
Well, to be honest Lamar
Life on the outside's been a little hard for him
People can be so judgemental
About men who have served time.
If you were repeat offender, you can forget it
Yes. Well...
I've heard Orson speak very fondly
of his prison friends especially you
Really? 'cause he seemed kind of mad
when I used him as a shield in the yard fight
Lamar he just tells that story now and laughs and laughs
Anyway, he's been feeling a little blue and I was hoping
you would pay him a visit and cheer him up
SOrry. I'll be breaking my parole
They catch me hanging out with an ex-cons
They can send me back to jail
Really? That's a silly rule
Don't worry though. Our house is
on the end of a very quiet cul-de-sac.
No one would even know you stop by
And of course I would compensate you for your time
And another three when you come
What the hell. No harm in a little social call
But you can't tell anybody I came
When you get to know me better, Lamar
You'll find I have no trouble keeping secrets
Hey. What are you doing here?
Your mom told me you were upset
I told her I know how to make you feel better
Mint chocolate chip? Thanks Daddy
I know this one's gonna take a lot more than ice cream
I keep thinking about him
He's out there and..
Maybe he's thinking about me
Honey, honey, he's not
He knows where I live. He knows what kind of car I drive
I've been wanting to go to the library
But I'm afraid he's gonna follow me
Look if you're worried about your car
Why don't we switch for a while?
Seriously? I drive your fancy car
And you'd drive my tiny little compact?
Hey there's nothing I would not do for my little...
You have air conditioner, right?
Yeah. There's nothing I would not do for my little girl
Are you ok?
I'm just having a bad day
My life's gotten sort of...complicated
Why
Oh it's... grown-up relationship stuff,
You wouldn't understand
Okay
But
Since you asked
So I think you're gonna have fun at Brandon's party
I heard there's gonna be a pony
Hey, you ok?
I'm worried about Mrs. Mayfair
Why?
She's not getting any younger
and it's really hard to meet guys in this town
Where did you hear that?
She told me
She also said mommy stole you
From her and that makes mommy a bad person
Buddy, your mommy is a great person
Now why you, sign Brandon's card, Okay?
And I'll be right back
Mike, watch it
Did you actually tell my six-year-old son
That his mother's a bad person
Well, I would have used more colorful language
But like you said, he is only six
You've never seen me get angry
But if you want to,
Just talk to my son one more time
Then you'll know what I am capable of
Mike, I love MJ...
I...would never do anything to hurt him
One more time
Oh...Julie...no
Hello.
Hi,it's your mother
Am I interrupting anything?
No, I am just at the library
Oh, really? The library.
Yeah. I thought I dive into an old favorite
Any vice versa, I am sure
Hum?
Honney, I don't blame you. You got back to that place,
Beacause it seems safe and comforting. Am I right?
I guess.
But trust me, it's a bad idea
Can we talk about this later, I only have one hour, I really want to finish
Ok, I want you to out of there right now
Mom, I'll see you soon
You bet you will.
You've been a busy girl
You got the ex-con booked,
Hidden cameras all set up
Come friday night, showtime
So what's the matter
We should be celebrating
I just hope we both clear that
That these photos are strickly for blackmail
Of course, we are not actually gonna send him to prison
Unless, I mean, we have to
No, Carl, even if he calls our bluff, we are not gonna turn him in
Excuse me, I am looking for the person
that belongs to the blue car
She is red head
With a man?
Yeah, she is with a man. The redhead is my daughter
Your daughter? Damn, you look good.
Thank you.
So, can you tell me what room they are in
I may not love him anymore,
but I am not gonna win my freedom by taking away this
Now you are angry
Bree, when you tell me you could
never hurt the man you used to love
It doesn't make me angry
It just reminds me why I love you so much
Don't you worry, no one is gonna get hurt
Oh,oh,my God,oh,my God
Hey, Eric,can you tell Carlos
I'm here for lunch, I'm gonna run to the ladies's room
I'll tell him
Hi,Lynette.
Hey, Gaby.
I'd ask you in, but I don't think
There is enough oxgeon here for the both of us
No.it's...comfy
Hey, I get that Carlos is trying to punish me,
But enough is enough, you gotta talk to him
Lynette, you never even came to talk to me that you are pregnant
I think this is between you and Carlos
OK, I know you are upset
But me keeping my pregnancy a seacret wasn't personal
Wasn't it?
No, listen to me Tom and I are still in debt
I need this promotion and
Carlos had already passed over a coworker
Beacase she was preganant
I couldn't risk telling him
Oh, beacause you thought
I'll talk to Carlos, he'd to fire you?
Yes.
So, clearly
I wasn't enough a friend for you to trust me
No.
But now, I am such a good friend,
I am the only one who can fix it for you?
I guess you are not going to talk to Carlos
Good guess
Can't believe she is dead
I know, I just saw her a few days ago
Talked about going to the mall
Who found her?
The assistant manager
I was there yesterday, I mean, thank God,
It would've freaked me out.
We are just talking about Emily
Yeah, I didn't really know her,
But I guess we are sort of connected now
You would like her, she's super nice
I gotta go home,
My mom was so freaked out.
It could be minished, if she wants me to be around
I'll give you a ride
Wish you go too, Danny
Hum... you go ahead
But, don't you need a ride?
No, I'll walk.
I just want to talk to Julie.
So do you want to get something to eat?
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.
Well, maybe you want to go to Emily's funeral together?
Everybody is going.
Danny, I know you like me.
But I can't hang out with you
Why not?
I just can't, it's complicated.
Cause you slept with my dad, isn't it?
Who told you that?
I figured it out a while ago.
If you know that? Why in the world...
Cause I like you...a lot.
Do you not see how weird that is?
No, it's ok. Cause I've foggiven you.
That's nice, but it's still weird.
Julie, please, I wanna be with you.
Danny, I am so sorry, but that is never going to happen.
Come on, they are gonna come, they gonna come.
I feel like I've been spending my entire life
Looking out of window.
Maybe, it's time we stop.
What are you saying?
I am saying it's time we thought about coming in.
Please tell me you didn't talk to them.
Oh, my god.
Calm down, all right? I was not an idiot.
I used the Prepay in the call and
It lasted less than a minute.
There is no way they are ever going to find us.
But still they know we are alive.
Don't you want to know
If they are ready to make a deal?
I killed a man, they'll be ready to make a deal
When I got a needle in my arm and
My elbows are rolled back in my head.
You don't know that.
You are never going to talk that again.
Do you hear me?
I still can't get that image of Lynette out of my head.
And she is missing in that cramping office
With Hands of William wood chips.
Yeah, I figure a couple of more days of this
Should be ready to back all these things.
She does deserve this, right?
She lied when she took the promotion.
What if her doctor had put her on bed rest,
Or what if I needed her to fly somewhere.
That would put the whole company in jeopardy.
Given that never happened,
You were saying she was doing a good job and
Now you are just doing all these mean things to her?
Me? This was your idea,
You wanted to put some snake in her office.
Rubber snakes.
We're completely justified here.
Oh, you're right.
Which is why we have the opportunity
To do something we never do, Carlos.
Forgive.
Seriously?
Tom and Lynette have been our friends for 15 years.
They gave us sausages of the month last Chrismas.
Those were good sausages.
I know Lynette,
She would never set out
To intentionally heart us.
I gotta admit, that I started to miss those guys.
You should've seen her when I was leaving her office.
Check the look in your eyes, she was so defeated.
You should've seen the look in her eyes, it was like
Screw you Lynette, I win.
So that's when you call the lawyer?
Oh, yes. I'm still not getting away with this.
They are not gonna harass me,
I'm going to sue their ass and
Carlos is being served papers tomorrow.
Wow, you really got work up here.
We are not having angery sex.
Just that I asked.
What I did tell you about putting away those clothes?
I'm serious. Nap time is over.
Danny? Danny! No, no, no, no, no, no. Nick!
Any woman can be the victim of a violent crime.
That is why it is necessary
To learn how to defend yourself.
In parking lot, in a park, on your own driveway,
An attack can happen anywhere,
It only takes several seconds.
Sorry I'm late, I had three parties to prepare for.
How tired that must be for you, juggling all those affairs.
Ok, everyone, team up.
I want you to do attacker or victim.
Hi, Gaby, you wanna attack me?
Oh, Ms. Mmcclusky, I don't want to hurt you.
Oh, please I've eaten burgers bigger than you are.
Bring it on.
All right, granny, prepared to break a hip.
So, we are supposed to be partners,
Do you want to attack me?
I could be persuaded.
Now, attackers, I want you to approach your victim.
Freakishly stronger lady, here.
I credited the bran.
Oh, that's very impressive. But the rest of you,
Approach your victim from behind placing in a choke hold.
Now victims, your impulse will be to pull away, wrong
You just choke harder.
Instead you want to push back on your attacker
Using your weight of pushing them off balance.
Susan, a little tight.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You feel so bad?
Being betrayed by someone you trusted that hurt you?
What are you talking about?
I know about you and Carl.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah, traitor.
Stop it.
You can't talk in that way at the time of an attack.
Jab your elbows.
I'm trying to.
How could you, you know,
How Carl treated me.
I'm sorry but if you...
Let me explain.
Ok, now, attackers and victims switch.
You don't wanna switch?
Not now, I'm not letting you get behind you,
You've already stabbed me in the back.
Ms. Delfino, release your victim, please.
She is not the victim here.
What about Orson? How could you do this to him?
You don't know about my marriage.
Orson, Orson is putting me through hell this year.
Too tight.
Susan, I know you are angery.
But Carl means more to me than just a fling and
I'm not giving him up.
So if that means our friendship is over?
But that's your decision, not mine.
You're going? We are just getting started.
I know but I think I've defended myself enough for one day.
I just got a call from the lawyer,
They're going to sue Carlos in any minute.
Wow, you're really going through this, uh?
Yeah,
We are not bad people, are we Tom?
What Carlos is doing to you is totally unfair and illegal.
No, we are good people.
Right, he started it. Screw him.
What's all this?
Candy, flowers, baby gifts.
Sort of my way of saying "I'm sorry."
Here are some crap to prove it.
Really?
Yeah, I don't want to fight anymore.
And neither does Carlos. So we are hoping we can talk.
Oh, Gaby, I'm so happy.
Here, take it, it's getting heavy.
I missed you.
Lynette?
Honey, we are having a moment here, please don't spoil it.
I'm not what's gonna spoil it.
Could you? Hold on a second.
I'm just I'm gonna make a quick phone call.
You know guys, I don't care what happens,
Let's not let anything interfere
Our relationship ever again.
Remember you said that.
Answer the phone, answer the phone.
What?
Oh, it's Carlos. Wondering what he wants.
Gaby, you know,
What you said about our friendship before.
No, no, no.
Let's just make a pact. We should...
Hi, baby, what's up?
I would never forgive you for this.
Gaby, please, what about our pact
We'd never make a pact. Here, MJ, catch.
You have to understand
I was just pretending to protect myself.
Oh, ladies, what's new?
Lynette is suing Carlos, here.
Once you apologied, I tried to call the guy off.
Lynette, you wanted to sue us that
Proved you are not my friend.
Hi, Karen, here's some candy.
I'd rather cut down.
Really? At your age, why bother?
Please I need to talk to you.
No, you need to talk to my lawyer.
Hey, Lynette
Got a project for you
Okay...
Who's this?
Steve matthews from legal.
You know, since we all seem to be lawyer up around here
Look, I was just trying to protect myself
It's just business
This is the apartment purchase expanses from last this four year
I'm of need all that itemized.
Done
By tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.
Hey, what I laughing this
This is at least two-days work
Not if you work tonight
Penny's Christmas pageant is tonight.
You know that ,you go every year
Lynette, are you telling me that you are unable to
What was it get
Unable to perform the assigned task in a timely manner..
Yeah,that's it
No, tell your undertaken friend I would get this I would done
In the timely manner
Great!
And will you tell Penny Gaby and I are gonna have to miss he pageant this year.
And we are so sorry
Thank you first for this coming
Before we have started, can I get you anything
You'd move to about to do to us, I'll take a cigarette a blindfold.
No no no, I have to decided
To put aside my range and sense of betrayal
I'm here to help you
Really?
Not you.
If you are actually considering having a serious relationship with this man
Then I will make sure you have all the facts
What kind of facts?
Carl facts
Carl,
Tell Bree, what you got me for my thirty's birthday.
How could I remember, it's so long ago
Nothing
He got me nothing because he forgot my birthday
And wasn't that long ago.
You see I was planning...
Now tell her where you spent our tenth annaversary
I'm sorry, what was that?
Strip club
No, Carl
That's nothing
Now tell her what you wanted for your thirty third's birthday
Ah, come on
You wanted me to ask me a friend to join us in the bedroom
Why you kept saying our shortage for
There is Bree
And that is the man you say you want to be with
Susan, I was into this with my eyes wide open
I know who Carl was and who he sometimes still is
But I believe him, because he says he wants to change
And isn't that what you're supposed to do
When you love someone?
Did you say "love"?
I think I did
Bree, I'll ask one question
Are you drinking again?
No!
Ok, ok, I was just checking
Well, if it does really the way you feel
Then you should be with him
And you have ...my blessing
Really, you can forgive me just like that?
You know, I was doing a lot of thinking since yesterday.
And I realize that I...
It's hard to find ...love
And when you do you should grab it and don't care anybody thinks.
And I really do want you to be happy as I'm with Mike
Thank you Susan
Don't worry, Susie Q
I'm going to do right by her.
You really think you can change
It's not easy to find the woman you wanna change for.
Oh, I, I didn't mean that...
Learned that in self-defense class
Bye, mom
Bye mom, bye mom,
We've taken it on.
Okay,
Wish your little angel luck.
Good luck, sweetie.
Now remember your dad's got video tape.
Your pageant are all gonna watched tomorrow.
Sweetie, I'm sorry. You know I'd be there, but...
You have to work
It's okay.
Hey, guys. Wait up.
The doctor's putting him on the observation for 72 hours.
It's standard procedure for...
Suicide attempt.
It's okay, Mona. Thanks for everything.
Hi, baby
What were you thinking, huh?
I'm sorry I called Feds.
I was trying to make your life easier.
Never know I'm gonna do things to make it harder
Look what I've done to this kid.
Nevember 10, 1991
Rained all day, remember?
Mmh
You went to the dinner
Before we went up to meet up the other's.
I pumped for pancakes
You didn't know anything
I had coffee. Hmm.
I forgot my umbrella at the booth
And then eight hours later, neither of us existed anymore.
I had to run, but you didn't.
You give up hell a lot just when I wanna be alone.
I would do it again.
And do anything for you guys.
I hope you know that.
I do.
Good morning, Leynette. It's nine o'clock.
Got my words?
Almost.
So are you telling me you are not done?
I just need one more hour.
Oh, Leynette.
If only I need it by ten
Unfortunately, I told you that I needed them by nine
Was that not clear?
Crystal clear.
It was impossible to get all worked done in a night.
Carlos, you know that when you gave it to me
Well, it wouldn't be impossible,
If you skipped your daughter's pageant.
I know you went
Anyway, this is very painful for me
But I have no other choice but to terminate an employeer.
You're really going to do this?
I believe I'm with my legal rights.
You need to clear up your personal belongings
Within an hour, Mrs Scavo.
I was up all night on this.
It's a shame.
So Mr Matthew has some paper for you to sign.
You're gonna regret this. I'm not gonna go quietly.
I don't care how you go,
I just want you gone.
Oh good, you're up
I'm Mona Clark. I live down the street from your union fous
I told them I will take real good care of you
Would you like some juice, Danny?
Taylor.
What?
It's not Danny.
My name's Taylor.
Bye girl, thanks for coming.
Mike, what are you doing here?
I'm here to pick up MJ.
But she said you couldn't make it.
She was picking him up for you.
Who? Susan?
No, your neighbor. Catherine.
What?
Did I do something wrong?
MJ?
Hi, daddy.
I drove by eileen's,
And I-I saw my little buddy standing out there.
MJ go home.
I figured you were late for some jobs.
I thought I did you a favor.
Now.
What did I tell you?
I needed to talk to him, Mike.
He deserves to know the truth.
His mother lies to him.
He needs to know that what you and I had was real.
You and I had nothing.
How can you say that?
It's true.
The whole time I was with you,
All I thought about was Susan.
Everytime I held you,
Everytime I kissed you,
All I was thinking was, god, I wish you were Susan.
If you mean it,
Please kill me.
It would be less painful.
I don't care enough about you to kill you.
The world is a dangerous place,
And we must learn to defend ourselves
From those who want to hurt us.
That stranger without a name,
An employeer who holds a garage,
The husband who won't let go.
Yes, we all try to defend ourselves so we won't get hurt.
Yes, I need an ambulance right away.
4356 Wisteria Lane. Please hurry.
I'm losing a lot of blood.
Until we realize, our pain
