you &apos;re wrong .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
no , i &apos;m not .
settle this . those little animated pictures on the internet ,
are they called &quot; gifs &quot; or &quot; jifs &quot; ?
但无论如何 反正不是念 &quot; 鸡爱a福 &quot;
well , the g stands for &quot; graphics . &quot;
that &apos;s a hard g , so i &apos;d say &quot; gif . &quot;
w ... the guy who invented it says it &apos;s &quot; jif . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , do you mean the guy or the juy ?
well , i &apos;ll give you three guesses
why i &apos;m so irritated .
something happened different from the way you wanted it .
i guess news travels fast .
it &apos;s true , a select group of scientists
was invited to a weekend symposium
at a former home of richard feynman ,
1965年的诺贝尔物理奖得主
and i wasn &apos;t included .
oh , sheldon , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not because
they don &apos;t think you &apos;re an elite scientist .
yeah , i bet you anything
it &apos;s just &apos; cause you &apos;re a pain in the ass .
you &apos;re just saying that to make me feel better .
look , you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this .
agreed .
i was gonna say &quot; or , &quot; but why bother ?
hey , raj .
hey , i got you a little gift .
oh , that &apos;s a lot of girl scout cookies .
you know me . i &apos;m from india .
i can &apos;t resist children begging .
so , how &apos;s it going with the title to the house ?
great , it &apos;s all done .
the lawyer tracked down my father
and got him to sign it over .
i didn &apos;t have to meet him , i didn &apos;t have to talk to him ,
i don &apos;t even know where he is .
wow , so you &apos;re not curious at all ?
nope .
what if he &apos;s in prison ?
what if he &apos;s a spy ?
what if he &apos;s in a beatles cover band ?
i &apos;m just saying , if he &apos;s got your nose and haircut ,
he &apos;d make a killer ringo .
thanks again for agreeing to do this .
oh , it &apos;s cool ; i &apos;ve never been on a podcast before .
well , you picked a good one to start .
wil &apos;s had lots of great guests .
jonathan frakes , brent spiner ,
michael dorn , gates mcfadden ...
those are star trek people .
yes !
i only figured that out because i &apos;ve never heard of any of them .
i deserve that .
i invited you on my show and i drove here .
sorry .
okay , so , this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show .
uh , we &apos;re gonna take some calls ,
we &apos;ll talk about what it was like on the set
of serial ape @-@ ist 2 .
it should be really fun .
this is exciting .
yeah .
so , how many people listen ?
most people download it later ,
but usually a few thousand people listen live .
what ? ! a few thousand people
listen to you talk about nerd stuff ?
again , right in the ears ,
straight to the feelings .
can you please pass the salt ?
sure .
it &apos;s not like i was invited to richard feynman &apos;s house
and have anything better to do .
is this how the rest of the night &apos;s going to be ?
i don &apos;t know the future .
do you think there &apos;s a chance
that an asteroid could hit the earth ,
destroying feynman &apos;s house and everyone in it ?
no , sheldon .
then buckle up ; you &apos;re in for a cranky night .
according to the codicil of the relationship agreement
which you insisted upon ,
we &apos;re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night .
you know i just put that in because of uterus stuff .
well , it applies to you , too .
i was afraid you might bring this up ,
so i have a work @-@ around .
there you go .
as far as you &apos;re concerned , i &apos;m smiling .
although , i must admit , i &apos;m smiling a little bit at the moment
because this loophole is so brilliant .
so , bernadette , have you thought
about how you &apos;re going to redecorate this place ?
you know , i &apos;m thinking
ripping up the carpets ,
maybe lose the wallpaper ,
all new light fixtures ...
you know , if you knocked out this wall ,
it would give you an open floor plan ,
and then-- it &apos;s a little scary , but could be fun--
indoor fire pit .
hey , i grew up in this house , okay ?
no one &apos;s knocking anything down .
okay , okay .
when he &apos;s at comic @-@ con ,
i &apos;m bringing in a wrecking ball .
can i help you ?
hi . are you howard wolowitz ?
yes .
um , this is a little weird ,
but a lawyer was trying to contact my father ,
because his name was still on the title for this house .
w ... uh , who &apos;s your father ?
sam wolowitz .
s @-@ sam wolowitz is my father .
i know .
well , wait , so if we have the same father ...
i mean , are you saying
you &apos;re my half @-@ brother ?
i think so .
bernadette , weird things are happening out here .
i think i started to suspect it was a bad movie
when i looked at the script and saw the title ,
serial ape @-@ ist 2 : monkey see , monkey kill .
uh , spoiler alert :
after the monkey sees , it kills .
i &apos;ve just been handed a note .
i &apos;m going to read it .
&quot; wil , do you want more diet coke ?
also , we have juice . &quot;
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to interrupt .
uh , that voice you just heard belongs to leonard ,
penny &apos;s fiance .
uh , leonard , why don &apos;t you grab some headphones and join us ?
really ?
yeah .
yeah , great .
so , while leonard gets set up ,
let &apos;s take a call .
hello , caller , you are on
with penny and wil from serial ape @-@ ist 2 .
i don &apos;t have a question .
i just want to say i &apos;m a big fan of the movie .
i &apos;ve seen it , like , ten times .
okay , well , i &apos;ll apologize for the first time ,
but the other nine are on you .
thanks a lot , caller .
you know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following .
really ?
yeah .
i was at a science @-@ fiction convention ,
and i saw a woman dressed as your half @-@ ape character .
oh , if she was with an indian guy dressed like a banana ,
that was just my friends , howard and raj .
all right , it &apos;s time for a very special guest caller ,
a friend of mine , who you probably know
as the director of such movies as clerks ,
or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that
he &apos;s the guy who directed clerks .
hello , kevin smith .
hey , man , yo , is everything okay , wil ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s been , like , two minutes
and you haven &apos;t even brought up stand by me .
1987年金球奖最佳电影及最佳导演提名
hey , kevin !
it &apos;s really exciting to talk to you .
it really is .
oh , you guys are very sweet . so , penny , listen ,
i saw your movie .
oh , wow . i wish it was better .
oh , don &apos;t worry about it .
have you seen some of kevin &apos;s films ?
you &apos;re cruisin &apos; for a beatin &apos; , wheaton .
anyway , man , i dug the ape movie , penny .
and i thought you were , like , really great in it .
you know , i &apos;m in the movie , too .
yeah , whatever . penny !
penny , how come you &apos;re not in more stuff , man ?
i &apos;d cast you in a minute .
seriously ?
oh , yeah , man .
i &apos;m actually in pre @-@ production on a movie right now .
way different than anything i &apos;ve ever done before .
it &apos;s called clerks 3 .
you should come over and read for a part .
oh , my , i would love that .
you have a new job .
well , maybe i can do both .
i don &apos;t think you can do both .
i don &apos;t think i asked you .
yeah , you tell him , penny .
stay out of it , kevin smith .
do you think there comes a point in life
when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things ?
probably not .
it &apos;s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities .
you know what ?
i used to be a fan of evolution ,
but i &apos;ve since evolved ,
and now i think it &apos;s dumb .
being left out is a terrible feeling .
no one understands that better than i do .
hey , look at that .
even in your example , you &apos;re all by yourself .
when there was a lice epidemic at my school ,
everybody got it except me .
i tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair ,
but i just got attacked by bees .
i can just picture them all right now at feynman &apos;s house ,
probably discussing schrodinger
and at the same time , not discussing schrodinger .
于1935年提出的有关 &quot; 猫既是死的又是活的 &quot; 著名思想实验
see ?
they &apos;re missing out on hilarious jokes like that .
and at the same time , not .
it reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister
would build forts in the living room
and wouldn &apos;t let me in .
i hated that so much .
you know ,
there &apos;s nothing i can do about getting you invited to the symposium ,
but if you wanted ...
we could build a fort .
isn &apos;t that a little juvenile ?
more juvenile than this ?
i &apos;ll get the blankets .
you google how to have childlike fun .
you know what , i &apos;m being a bad host .
let me get some more coffee .
oh , let me do it , howard .
no , i got it .
so , josh , what do you do ?
i &apos;m studying oceanography down in san diego .
oh , how nice .
i loved finding nemo .
enough chitchat .
how do we know you are who you say you are ?
why would i lie ?
okay , you got me there .
you here looking for money ?
no .
a kidney , cornea , piece of his liver ?
no .
you &apos;re in a beatles cover band
and you need howard to replace your dad as ringo .
why don &apos;t you help with the coffee ?
okay , but something smells fishy .
and not just because you work around sea animals .
that actually sounds interesting ,
and i &apos;d like to learn more about it .
hey , you okay ?
not really .
this guy shows up out of the blue ,
and now i have a brother ?
my father has another family ?
i get it .
what do you want to do ?
i don &apos;t know . i ...
i &apos;d just like him to go away .
i can &apos;t deal with this .
all right , i &apos;ve got your back .
thank you . come on .
and i &apos;d like to point out
this wall just provided a lot of privacy !
i can &apos;t believe my brother &apos;s an astronaut .
that &apos;s amazing . what was it like ?
listen , dude ,
it &apos;s time for you to hit the road .
hey , hey , the young man asked a good question .
so , for those of you just tuning in ,
we are listening to a really fun fight
between my costar ...
no , no , no .
we &apos;re not fighting ; we &apos;re just ...
having a conversation .
all right .
we &apos;re listening to a really fun conversation
between my costar from serial ape @-@ ist 2
and her fiance , who doesn &apos;t believe women should have dreams .
give me back that juice .
what is the harm if i audition ?
well , what if you get it ?
i don &apos;t know , i make a movie ,
become rich and famous ,
win an oscar , a golden globe
and live an incredibly wonderful life .
from a kevin smith movie ?
oh , i &apos;m hanging up now .
don &apos;t you listen to him , buddy .
you &apos;re awesome .
you &apos;re one of the greatest directors of our time .
i don &apos;t have a part for you , wheaton .
and that was kevin smith .
thanks a lot .
i &apos;m just trying to protect you .
how many times did i see you get your heart broken
trying to make it as an actress ?
okay , instead of protecting me , why don &apos;t you try
being excited when something good happens ?
i &apos;m always excited for you !
i &apos;m excited that you found this new job
where you &apos;re making decent money .
decent ? i make twice what you make .
wait , twice ? !
yeah .
like , &quot; times two &quot; twice ?
for those of you at home , leonard just found out
his fiance makes way more money than he does .
let &apos;s listen .
i went to school for half my life .
i have a doctorate .
i &apos;m still paying off college loans .
well , how much do you owe ?
maybe i can help you out .
wil , can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit ?
for those of you at home ,
i am shaking my head &quot; no . &quot;
how &apos;s it going , sheldon ?
wonderful !
i just finished hanging the lights .
can i come in ?
yes , oh , but enter through the side .
batman is a load @-@ bearing blanket .
amazing .
i know .
this isn &apos;t the printout .
this is my real face .
what are we doing ?
this is a fort .
let &apos;s sit on the floor .
roughing it ? okay .
everything looks so big from down here .
this must be how leonard feels .
i &apos;m surprised you could hear me
with this thin mint in your ear !
yeah , pretty cool , huh ?
yeah .
anyway , i should probably get going .
howie , have you noticed how often people say that
when you start to do magic ?
sorry , i have a long drive .
well , i hope i get to see you again .
i hope so , too .
i &apos;ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with .
keep dreaming .
hey , i threw out the first pitch at an angels game .
he did it with a robot .
you had sex with a robot ?
that &apos;s not what she meant .
but technically , yes .
hang on , if you &apos;re making all this money ,
where is it ?
in a safe place .
what does that mean , under your bed ?
no , it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds .
i &apos;m not overly conservative .
i &apos;m young , so my guy said i can afford to take some risks .
wait a minute , you have &quot; a guy &quot; ?
don &apos;t you have a guy ?
why would i have a guy ? i don &apos;t have any money !
oh , sweetie ,
you should really get some money .
for those of you listening at home ,
how great is this ?
wil , i &apos;m begging you , just please turn that off .
sure .
and we &apos;re back .
leonard , why are you making such a big deal out of this ?
so our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years .
this is the way life is .
and i &apos;m sure in time they &apos;ll change again .
great , you &apos;re not only more successful than me ,
now you &apos;re more mature .
okay , look , would it make you feel better
if i did something dumb like sneak out of work one day
to go audition for a kevin smith movie ?
that would be great , thank you !
i &apos;m just gonna jump in here real quick .
leonard , a moment ago ,
you were dead set against penny resuming her acting career ,
but now you &apos;re all for it .
is it fair to say that she played you like a violin ?
yes , it is , wil .
so , i have to ask ,
was the robot sexy ?
it was actually just a mechanical hand .
&apos;cause that &apos;s all you need , right ?
you are my brother .
okay , so the final four forts
in the first annual best fort ever contest ,
or &quot; fort off , &quot; are ...
... fort knox ,
fort ticonderoga ,
fort sumter and ...
fort cozy mcblanket .
i &apos;d say ...
knox over ticonderoga
提康德罗加堡是美国旧时极富战略意义的堡垒
&apos;cause it &apos;s got the gold .
and mcblanket over sumter
随后林肯总统对南方宣战 爆发南北战争
&apos;cause it has a higher thread count .
10 : 00 .
date night &apos;s over .
wait , no .
we haven &apos;t picked a winner .
we both know this one &apos;s gonna win .
well , of course we do .
fort knox doesn &apos;t have a secret physics lending library .
come on , i &apos;ll help you take this down .
well , wait .
what if , just this once ,
we suspend the date night parameters
and you stay later ?
well , as long as we &apos;re suspending the parameters ,
i could stay really late
and we could have our first sleepover .
that &apos;s a big step .
it &apos;s a big fort .
very well .
i will agree to a family @-@ friendly ,
g @-@ rated , boy @-@ girl sleepover .
pg .
some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers .
g @-@ rated ,
with a warning for families with babies and toddlers .
you got yourself a sleepover .
do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas ?
would it alarm you to know
that i hid those things here two years ago
just in case this ever came up ?
it would ,
but you know how much i admire preparedness .
how did you know we &apos;d be in the living room ?
who says this is the only one i hid ?
hello ? what is this ?
we built a fort !
are those my sheets ?
yes , they are .
okay .
well , you kids have fun .
i &apos;m gonna go to sleep .
leonard , don &apos;t you want to see the inside of the fort ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
oh , come on .
i really wanted to tell someone they can &apos;t come in .
okay , fine .
sheldon , may i please visit your fort ?
i want to say no ,
but it &apos;s too glorious . get in here !
thank you .
okay , have a seat on the floor .
not there . that &apos;s my spot .
