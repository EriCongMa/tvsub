this is so stupid !
i mean , i gave barry up , right ?

no .
i guess it would be different if i were with somebody .
whoa , what ....
what happened to &quot; forget relationships ! i &apos;m done with men ! &quot;
the whole penis embargo ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s not about no guys . it &apos;s about the right guy .
with barry it was safe and easy , but there was no heat .
with paolo , all there was , was heat .
lt was this raw , animal , sexual
right . i got it .
i was there .
do you think you can have both ?
someone who &apos;s your best friend but also can make your toes curl .
yes .
yes , i do . i really do .
in fact , it &apos;s funny .
often , someone you wouldn &apos;t think could ...
... curl your toes ...
... might just be the one who ...
... gets interrupted .
how was the movie ?
wonderful !
so good !
suck fest .
total chick flick .
i &apos;m sorry it wasn &apos;t one of those movies with guns and bombs ...
... and buses going really fast !
i don &apos;t need violence in a movie ...
... as long as there &apos;s a little nudity .
there was nudity .
i meant female nudity .
i don &apos;t need to see lou grant frolicking .
hugh ! hugh grant !
all right , i &apos;ve got to go .
come on , marcel .
we &apos;re gonna go take a bath . yes , we are , aren &apos;t we ?
they &apos;re still just friends , right ?
and i will see you tomorrow .
you &apos;re gonna spend tomorrow at aunt rachel &apos;s .
does aunt monica get a say in this ?
please , aunt monica , please ?
unclench . you &apos;re not even gonna be here .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re discussing this .
i agree . i &apos;m , like , in disbelief .
if it was gonna happen , wouldn &apos;t it have happened already ?
she said she wants a relationship with someone exactly like me .
she said that ?
i added the exactly like me &quot; part .
but she &apos;s looking for someone . and someone will be there tonight .
&quot; tonight &quot; tonight ?
it &apos;s perfect . it &apos;ll just be the two of us .
she spent all day taking care of my monkey .
i can &apos;t remember the last time a girl took care of my monkey .
anyway , i figured after work , i &apos;d pick up some wine ...
... go over there and try to woo her .
know what you should do ?
take her back to the 1.890s when that phrase was last used .
if you keep this up , you &apos;ll be finished by the weekend .
the one in the feathered boa is dr. francis .
now , she used to be a man .
look , there &apos;s raven .
we hate her . we &apos;re glad she &apos;s dying .
and then what ? marcel !
are you playing with monica &apos;s shoes ? you &apos;re not supposed to

who died ? who died ?
roll him over ! come on , roll him over !
well , we know it wasn &apos;t dexter , right , marcel ? because
marcel ?
how could you lose him ?
i don &apos;t know !
we were watching tv , he pooped in monica &apos;s shoe ....
wait . he pooped in my shoe ? which one ?
i don &apos;t know . the left one !
which ones ?
those little clunky amish things you think go with everything .
why is the air in here so negative ?
rachel lost marcel .
oh , no ! how ?
he pooped in my shoe .
which one ?
the cute black ones i always wear .
no , which one ?
the right or left ?
because the left one is lucky .
come on ! what am i gonna do ?
all right . you &apos;re a monkey . you &apos;re loose in the city .
where do you go ?
it &apos;s his first time out , so he &apos;ll do touristy things .
i &apos;ll go to cats . you go to the russian tea room .
oh , my god ! come on , you guys !
he &apos;ll be home any minute . he &apos;s gonna kill me !
search the building . take the first floor . we &apos;ll take the rest .
what am i gonna do ?
you stay here and wait by the phone .
spray lysol in my shoe and wait for ross to kill you .
does anybody want to trade ?
what do you want ?
mr. heckles , have you seen a monkey ?
i left a belgian waffle out here . did you take it ?
why &apos;d you leave it in the hall ?
i wasn &apos;t ready for it .
have you seen a monkey ?
i saw regis philbin once .
thank you , mr. heckles .
you owe me a waffle .
he &apos;s a black capuchin monkey with a white face ...
... with russian dressing and pickles on the side .
thanks .
how did it go today ?
oh , great ! it went great . really great .
is that wine ?
you want some ?
oh , i would love some .
but let &apos;s not drink it here .
i &apos;m feeling crazy . you wanna go to newark ?
okay , but before we head off to the murder capital of the northeast ...
... i kind of wanted to run something by you .
you know how we were talking before ...
... about relationships , and stuff .
oh , god , ross , i cannot do this !
okay , quick and painful .
oh , god !
okay , all right . all right , okay .
please don &apos;t hate me .
what ?
you know marcel ?
i kind of lost him .
i can &apos;t believe this .
all i asked you to do was keep him in here !
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s partially my fault .
i shouldn &apos;t have had you start with a monkey .
you should have started with a pencil .
i &apos;m doing everything i can . everyone &apos;s looking for him and i got
who is it ?
animal control .
i &apos;ve even got animal control .
you called animal control ?
why ? do you not like them ?
marcel is an illegal exotic animal .
i &apos;m not allowed to have him . if they find him , they &apos;ll take him away .
well , now , see , you never ever told us that .
because i never expected you to invite them to the apartment !
thanks for coming .
somebody called about a monkey ?
you know , that was a complete misunderstanding .
we thought we had a monkey , but we didn &apos;t .
turned out it was a hat .
cat !
we checked , no one &apos;s seen marcel .
my uncle marcel .
ls that who the monkey &apos;s named after ?
possession of an illegal exotic is punishable ...
... by two years in prison and confiscation of the animal .
oh , my god !
you &apos;d put that poor little creature in jail ?
remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first ?
yes , but there isn &apos;t always time .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s some friendly way to reconcile this . have a seat .
we haven &apos;t met . i &apos;m monica geller .
oh , my god , you are !
and you &apos;re rachel greene !
luisa gianetti ! lincoln high ?
i sat behind you guys in homeroom .
luisa ! oh , my god !
monica ! it &apos;s luisa !
i went there too !
luisa ! from homeroom !
you have no idea who i am , do you ?
no .
not at all .
well , maybe that &apos;s because you spent four years ignoring me .
would it have been hard to say , &quot; morning , luisa ... &quot;
... or &quot; nice overalls &quot; ?
oh , i &apos;m so sorry !
it &apos;s not so much you . you were fat . you had your own problems .
but you . what a bitch !
what ?
you know what ? be that as it may ...
... could you help us with the monkey thing , for old times &apos;sake ?
go , bobcats !
i could . but i won &apos;t .
if i find that monkey , he &apos;s mine .
sorry .
marcel ?
marcel ?
hi , can i help you ?
we &apos;re having an emergency , and we were looking for something .
a monkey .
yes , have you seen any ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen a monkey .
can you fix radiators ?
sure ! did you try turning the knob back the other way ?
of course !
oh . then , no .
taste this . is there too much rum ?
just a second .
hope you find your monkey .
no , wait !
we may not know about radiators ...
... but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu .
aren &apos;t we in the middle of something ?
but these women are very hot , and they need our help .
and they &apos;re very hot !
we can &apos;t , all right ?
we &apos;re sorry .
you don &apos;t know how sorry . we promised to find this monkey .
he &apos;s this high and answers to the name marcel .
so if we could get pictures of you , it &apos;d help us out .
from now on , you don &apos;t get to talk to other people .
oh , my god !
what ?
something brushed up against my right leg .
oh , it &apos;s okay . it was just my left leg .
look , phoebe !
oh , marcel ! come here !
step aside , ladies .
what are you gonna do ?
just a tranquilizer .
run , marcel , run !
damn !
are you okay ?
i think so .
oh , gosh !
we &apos;ve been all over the neighborhood ! he &apos;s just gone !
you don &apos;t know that .
it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s dark .
he doesn &apos;t know the village !
and now i have a broken foot . i have no monkey and a broken foot !
thank you very much !
i &apos;ve said i &apos;m sorry a million times .
what do you want me to do ?
you want me to break my foot too ? i &apos;ll break it right now .
oh , my god ! there , are you happy now ?
yeah , now that you kicked the sign ...
... i don &apos;t miss marcel anymore !
it &apos;s not like i did this on purpose .
no , this is just vintage rachel .
things just sort of happen around you !
you &apos;re off in &quot; rachel land , &quot; doing your &quot; rachel thing ... &quot;
... oblivious to people &apos;s monkeys or to people &apos;s feelings and
i don &apos;t want to hear it ! forget it , okay ?
what ?
hey , banana man !
this is so intense !
one side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea .
what &apos;s with phoebe ?
tranquilizer dart .
hi ! did you order some bananas ?
what about it ?
give me my monkey back !
i don &apos;t have a monkey .
then what &apos;s with the bananas ?
potassium .
okay , where is he ?
you &apos;re wasting your time .
what ?
what have you done to him ?
that &apos;s my monkey . that &apos;s patty .
are you insane ? come here , marcel .
come here , patty .
come here , marcel .
come here , patty .
here , monkey .
here , monkey !
gotcha !
give me my monkey back !
it &apos;s mine .
take this up with the judge .
that &apos;s not my monkey . the dress is mine . send it back whenever .
all right , i want my monkey !
oh , come on , luisa .
sorry , prom queen .
you had to be a bitch in school , instead of fat .
in high school , i was prom queen ...
... and the homecoming queen and you ...
... were also there .
but this isn &apos;t high school . we &apos;re all adults here !
heckles ! can i have this ?
for the most part .
if you take this monkey , i &apos;ll lose an important person in my life .
you can hate me if you want , but please do not punish him .
you have a chance to be the bigger person here .
take it !
no .
all right . then i &apos;ll call your supervisor and tell her ...
... you shot my friend with a dart !
it &apos;ll be nice to get this off , won &apos;t it ?
or we can leave it on . that &apos;s fine .
with the right pumps , that would be a great little outfit .
listen , i &apos;m sorry i was so hard on you before
no , it was my fault . i almost lost your
yeah , but you got him back . you were great .
we still have that bottle of wine .
are you in the mood for something grape ?
sure , that would be good .
all right .
the neighbors must be vacuuming .
well , as long as we &apos;re here ...
... and not on the subject ....
i was thinking about ...
... how mad we got at each other before .
and maybe it was partially because of how we
rachel ?
barry ?
i can &apos;t do it . i can &apos;t marry mindy .
i think i &apos;m still in love with you .
we have got to start locking that door !
show us ! come on !
lt was such a long time ago .
okay , fine . all right .
this is me in the sound of music . see the von trapp kids ?
that &apos;s because i &apos;m in front of them .
big nun !
i thought that was an alp .
high school wasn &apos;t my favorite time .
i loved high school .
it was four years of parties , dating and sex and
well , i went to boarding school with 400 boys .
any sex i had would &apos;ve involved a major lifestyle choice .
doesn &apos;t it seem like a million years ago ?
