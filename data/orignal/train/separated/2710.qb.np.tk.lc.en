so , she &apos;s a dancer , right ? broadway , summer stock , all that shit .
who was telling me , ginny used to do a little dancing herself , right ?
taught ballet years ago .
who &apos;s that ?
nobody , jersey .
ralph cifaretto &apos;s crew .
anyway , i go over to her house one night ...
she &apos;s dressed like a fucking cat , like from that show .
eye makeup , claws , the whole bit .
you okay ?
pardon me a minute .
donny , right ?
john , how you doing ?
what &apos;s the matter ? not funny anymore ?
funny ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ? please !
funny ?
there &apos;s funny !
whoa , what the fuck ?
what &apos;d he do ?
he &apos;s a cunt . a sorry sack of shit .
come on , let me get you out of here .
no , please .
scumbag ? let me buy you a drink .
what the fuck ?
what are you doing still up ?
penny serenade was on amc .
john , your coat ! is that burberry ?
oh , my god , what happened ?
nothing . i tripped .
you tripped where ?
i don &apos;t know .
the steps by carmine &apos;s .
john , your hand is bleeding .
i used it to break my fall . jesus , what is this , the inquisition now ?
i had a few cognacs .
go to sleep .
for tax @-@ deferred growth the annuity &apos;s fine ,
but if i &apos;m hearing you right ...
liquidity &apos;s the real concern ?
well , we do occasionally need ready access to our money .
honestly , guys , i &apos;d recommend the life insurance trust .
that , coupled with a growth @-@ oriented reallocation of your assets .
including an assortment of other investment vehicles .
what , like classic cars ?
no , stocks , bonds .
i think he &apos;s pulling your leg , brian .
gotta remember that one .
so , great , we &apos;ll open an account , get the paperwork started .
brian , look , no offense .
i know we &apos;re family , but let me think about it .
run it by my accountant .
ginsberg ? he &apos;s a cpa , he &apos;s not an investment advisor .
whatever , he knows about this stuff .
you know what , carm ? talk to your accountant . two heads .
dad , it &apos;s uncle sil !
i gotta get that .
say hello to janelle .
i &apos;ll walk you out , bri .
hang it up , a. j !
what happened ?
hey .
hey yourself .
what the fuck , john ?
i got nothing to say .
you got nothing to say ?
that fucking kid is in intensive care .
i thought he worked for ralph .
and ralph works for me . so , i ask you again , what the fuck ?
let it suffice that i know and carmine knows ...
that foppy cocksucker &apos;s holding out on us .
fernandez paving , ralph &apos;s contracting company .
my guy read the receipts for the waterproofing at the esplanade .
this fucking ralph &apos;s more creative than spielberg .
he &apos;s off almost $ 4,000 , third time in a row now .
we agreed , no looting the job site .
first of all , that hasn &apos;t been established .
second of all , this is how you handle it ?
consider it a message .
he &apos;s in miami .
they got phones there , last time i checked .
he &apos;s got a bad history , tony .
cute cocksucker could wind up dead .
what are you saying here ?
he &apos;s a two @-@ faced fucking prick .
i thought ralph was your friend .
right , that &apos;s rich .
did you hear what my &quot; friend &quot; said about my wife ?
he made a crack about ginny &apos;s weight .
something about her having a 90 @-@ pound mole on her ass .
well , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s deplorable .
who told you this ?
what &apos;s important is that it was said .
lf he did say it , i didn &apos;t hear it .
&apos;cause he knows better than to make a remark like that when i &apos;m around .
she &apos;s fighting a weight problem since the kids were born .
weight watchers , richard simmons , fasting .
she works very fucking hard .
you &apos;re telling me how hard it is ?
it &apos;s different for women .
body image , self @-@ esteem .
i &apos;ll tell you , though .
i never had a problem with ginny &apos;s weight .
to me , she &apos;s beautiful .
rubenesque .
that woman is my life .
to think she &apos;s being mocked ...
all right , look , john ...
i &apos;m not gonna sit here and deny that ralph can be a fucking asshole .
and that was a horrible thing to say .
but even if it was said , you can &apos;t be serious about him winding up ...
you know .
she &apos;s the mother of my children .
i know she is , john .
at least hear ralph out .
how long we go back ?
all of us ?
the kid last night ...
he was laughing .
about this ?
i don &apos;t know .
all right .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s just been sticking in my craw .
so , this kid gonna be okay ?
i don &apos;t know , he &apos;s still unconscious .
my fucking temper . is he married , children , anything ?
lives with his mother .
i &apos;ll send her something nice .
i &apos;m surprised he didn &apos;t call you . who knows ? maybe he &apos;ll be right back .
one sugar , right ?
so , how are things at casa del furio ?
the pakistani , the neighbor .
i want to make my garage into the guesthouse so my parents can visit .
he says to me , because of the rules , i cannot do it .
right , the zoning .
the man who sells me the house , he says nothing .
as far as i remember ... once title has passed , you have no legal recourse .
anyway ... next week , i make a party for the housewarm .
what a nice idea .
this is my real estate exam .
there &apos;s one more prep course i want to take .
so , next sunday is the party .
we will be there .
now , here , you see ?
&quot; except in cases of demonstrable fraud ...
&quot; transfer of title is binding
once the grantee registers the deed with the county clerk . &quot;
some people say college only serves to show grad schools ...
who managed to show up somewhere four years in a row .
but volunteering at the law center actually allows you to make a difference .
last year , with our help ... over a half a dozen crack babies
were reunited with their natural mothers ...
several of whom are now in recovery .
eventually , with the help of aclu attorneys ...
you &apos;ll be filing court papers and helping with legal research .
there &apos;s a sign @-@ up sheet and some fliers if you &apos;re interested . thanks .
that &apos;s so true what you said about college being an audition for grad school .
so much for higher learning . living in the moment ?
check out the law center . there &apos;s some really cool people there .
there were 15 guys at the dinner when ralph told that joke .
could be anybody flapping their gums .
what i don &apos;t get is why .
what &apos;s the upside of telling johnny that ?
get in good with new york somehow .
loose lips sink ships .
first , john knows about flipping the property by the esplanade ,
now this shit .
how about patsy ?
he &apos;s had issues , maybe he &apos;s holding a grudge .
you really think he &apos;s that cagey ?
albert , then .
wait a minute .
what if vesuvio &apos;s bugged and the fucking feds told johnny ?
conspiracy theories now ?
why not ?
create a little dysentery among the ranks ?
first of all , the place is swept once a week .
as for the feds , there &apos;s more interesting shit being talked about in there ...
besides ginny &apos;s fat ass .
sil ? the liquor inspector &apos;s here .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s not possible , right ?
silvio talking to johnny ?
you never know , t.
jason &apos;s always been a well @-@ adjusted young man .
so why now , elliot ?
three years at bard and suddenly now as a senior , this epic drift ?
no focus , no drive .
he &apos;s actually talked about dropping out and joining the forestry service .
well , some people thrive on solitude .
senior year . there &apos;s something
about the light at the end of that tunnel that can be very frightening .
saskia &apos;s a senior . is she going through any of this ?
sask has always been highly motivated . kenahora .
where &apos;s richard in all this anyway ?
jason barely speaks to him anymore .
since when ?
right after the rape .
jason may be feeling guilty himself , jen .
he &apos;s powerless to avenge you ...
and resents his father for the same shortcomings .
hey , george hamilton .
how &apos;s the back ?
oh , the masseuse down there , the del ray ?
magic fucking fingers .
tony call ?
on his way .
he know you broke up with his sister ?
no , no . not unless she told him .
you know what that crazy bitch was into ?
what ?
she wanted to stick a dildo up my ass ... make believe she was pimping me out .
i told her , &quot; get the fuck out of here ! &quot;
what the fuck ?
the whole family &apos;s nuts .
how are you ?
how you doing ?
fellas , take this shit to my house . open some windows , air the place out .
for you , florida &apos;s finest .
thanks .
how &apos;s donny k ?
i was just asking them about that .
i gotta get over there , get the full report .
any idea who &apos;s writing the family gossip column ?
you know , funny thing about that ...
i don &apos;t remember saying anything about ginny .
come on , ralph . i was sitting right there .
then maybe i said something . i forget . there was a lot of wine that night .
what about the land deal , frelinghuysen avenue ?
you forget , and maybe tell him that you , me and zellman made all that money ?
did i tell him about it ? no .
but i sure as shit ended up paying for it .
when you think about it , johnny &apos;s got some balls .
big house , lining his pocket with our hard @-@ earned cash ?
who &apos;s he think &apos;s keeping that fat bitch in devil dogs anyway ?
whatever he is , he &apos;s also carmine &apos;s underboss ...
so you &apos;re gonna fucking placate him .
oh , what , apologize ?
no , you do that , it &apos;ll be worse .
whoever told him this , it &apos;s your word against theirs .
you &apos;re highly fucking outraged .
hello , sweetie . it &apos;s your secret admirer .
is he there ? oh hi , ralph , one sec .
john , ralph cifaretto !
i &apos;ll take it in there .
okay , hon .
john , it &apos;s me .
and ?
and i &apos;m calling to tell you how appalled i am .
i just got back , i talked to tony .
i love ginny , i would never say anything like that .
that &apos;s not what i heard .
from who ?
from who , john ?
i don &apos;t betray confidences . are you denying you said it ?
fuck , yes , i &apos;m denying i said it .
i don &apos;t believe you .
just tell me who said this , i &apos;ll put a bullet in their fucking eye !
you &apos;re a real weasel , you know that ?
john , please .
look , last year , when tony and i had our thing , that misunderstanding ...
you were the voice of reason .
you were the one that told me to apologize .
so , you &apos;re apologizing ?
no
if that &apos;s what it takes .
why would you ? i thought you didn &apos;t say it .
i didn &apos;t say it .
you know something , ralph ?
not only are you a thief , you &apos;re a lying fucking prick .
i should &apos;ve let tony chop your head off a year ago .
what did i say ? no apology !
i want you to sanction a hit on ralph cifaretto .
what , are you fucking kidding me ?
he violated my wife &apos;s honor .
ralph slept with ginny ?
he insulted her . he made a very insensitive joke
about her body to some friends of ours .
what did he say ?
i have to repeat it ?
my word &apos;s not good enough ?
not if you want him clipped over it .
he said ...
she was having a 90 @-@ pound mole removed from her ass .
the implication was , her ass is so big ...
she could have a mole that size removed from it .
it &apos;s an off @-@ color remark , it was highly inappropriate .
if you want , i &apos;ll demand he &apos;s taxed .
but clip him ?
is it all just about money ?
i &apos;ll crack him good . i &apos;ll ask for $ 200,000 .
$ 200,000 for insulting my wife ? what &apos;s next ,
carmine , he get to fuck her for $ 1 million ?
he wants to fuck her ?
i &apos;m making a point , i &apos;m talking about my wife &apos;s honor here ! my honor !
we depend on this guy . there are millions of dollars at stake .
we can &apos;t afford it , john .
a roomful of guys making fun of my wife ...
and you &apos;re not gonna let me deal with this ?
not that way . my answer &apos;s gotta be no .
i want a sit @-@ down then , with ralph the fucking thief .
get this fernandez paving bullshit dealt with .
he was accused of a crime of severe immorality .
they actually beat him for it with sticks .
the truth was he had a photograph of britney spears with his belongings .
that &apos;s horrible .
dad ?
thought i was in the wrong place .
what are you doing here ?
i was looking for a glass of milk to dunk these in ...
and i thought maybe you could help me out .
got a meeting in the city later .
rahimah , this is my dad .
how you doing ?
hello .
want a donut ?
no , thanks .
i &apos;ll see you later , meadow .
okay .
so , what &apos;s this your mother tells me about you joining the legal aid society ?
south bronx law center . i &apos;m volunteering .
they provide free legal counsel for the indigent and disenfranchised .
and this rahoomi , she &apos;s what , your first client ?
what happened to being a pediatrician ?
i thought that was a great field for you , the way you love kids .
nothing happened to it . i can &apos;t explore some career options ?
oh , defending farebeaters is a career ?
is that why you came here , to annoy me ?
hey , you wanna help people , that &apos;s fine . that &apos;s very noble .
really , i mean it .
just don &apos;t be a sucker , okay ? a lot of these indigenous types ...
they got plenty of money to smoke crack and gamble and all that shit .
you ought to know .
oh , i see . that &apos;s what this is ?
you &apos;re working with minorities now , to get back at me for being mean to noel .
god , listen to you .
believe it or not , the world doesn &apos;t revolve around you .
come on , let &apos;s go to the bookstore .
you probably need a sweatshirt or something .
hey , take it easy !
how was the traffic ?
tunnel was a little backed up .
this time of day , g.w. , you zip right over .
all right , let &apos;s straighten this out .
i talked to the guy over at fernandez paving , the accountant .
fernandez has been using this jerk for years .
anyway , it turns out you &apos;re right .
the guy &apos;s been adding 50 gallons of sealant every 1,000 yards .
excuse me , i can &apos;t do this .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t listen to this bullshit .
i &apos;m trying to explain .
fuck you !
john , please .
don &apos;t fucking &quot; john &quot; me !
hey , we &apos;re trying to settle this .
it &apos;s not about that .
i &apos;m sorry , carmine . i can &apos;t be in the same room with this man .
have you talked to jason la penna lately ?
actually , i try not to . when i came out , he acted all weird .
i can &apos;t believe i actually kissed him once .
his mother tells me he &apos;s having a rough time of it .
jen ? please , i &apos;m sure she &apos;s overreacting .
apparently , he &apos;s talked about dropping out .
he &apos;s okay , but jason is like the cliched psychiatrist &apos;s kid .
slightest bump in the road , he knows exactly what to say to get attention .
there any of that crumb cake left ?
counter .
what &apos;s all that ?
i &apos;m consolidating some bills .
maybe you don &apos;t care about our future , tony , but i do .
where do you get that i don &apos;t care ? i met with your cousin .
yeah , you met with brian . you sat there eating cake and making wisecracks .
it &apos;s boring to me , okay ?
you gonna cry now ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
when you ignore me , tony ...
when you trivialize things that are important to me ...
like this family &apos;s financial security ,
it makes me feel unloved .
that &apos;s your problem right there , because you equate love with money !
you equate love with money !
is it safe ?
we each got a new cell phone .
talk on it once , you toss it . totally untraceable .
it &apos;s what the taliban used to do .
let &apos;s get started . my daughter @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s coming here with the baby later .
hello ?
is he there ?
yeah , ton &apos; .
okay , you &apos;re all set . just talk into there .
junior ?
who &apos;s that ? tony ?
junior , it &apos;s carmine . how you doing ?
i &apos;m going to the poorhouse , that &apos;s how i &apos;m doing .
when you had that rico trial , what &apos;d that run you ?
a lot .
where you going ?
i told you , i gotta pick up sophia .
junior , can we do this already ?
yeah , right .
johnny and ralph cifaretto , right ?
ralph insulted john &apos;s wife ?
that &apos;s correct .
who &apos;s on the wire now ?
it &apos;s john , corrado .
so , what did ralph do exactly ?
he made a very hurtful remark , it &apos;s not worth repeating .
it &apos;s not important . let &apos;s just agree it was unkind .
let &apos;s point out , too ... that it &apos;s only been alleged something was said .
he &quot; allegedly &quot; said what he said to a group of people , friends of ours .
if you weren &apos;t there , how do you know it &apos;s true ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to say .
all due respect , but this is bullshit .
somebody in my family &apos;s talking out of school ...
and you &apos;re not at liberty to say who ?
i should be making the beef here .
my nephew &apos;s right .
let &apos;s stick to the issue . a horrible insult was made against ginny .
end of fucking story .
what does he want done about it ?
i want to avenge her honor , as is my right to do .
all right , fine . you tell me who told you about it , we &apos;ll bring him in here .
he corroborates what you &apos;re saying , i &apos;ll give you ralph on a platter .
is nothing sacred ? i mean , this is my wife we &apos;re talking about here .
if this were years ago , would i even have had to ask ?
i mean , what happened to this thing ?
for god &apos;s sake , we bend more rules than the catholic church .
all right , look .
let &apos;s assume , for the sake of argument ... ralph said what you think he said .
is clipping him gonna unring that bell ?
nobody &apos;s getting clipped .
i want satisfaction .
will you accept an apology ?
that ship has sailed .
you &apos;re being unreasonable .
ralph cifaretto &apos;s the only one who can handle the esplanade ?
put pontecorvo in there .
there are millions of dollars at stake .
again with the money ?
yeah , again with the money .
it &apos;s settled , john . so either name a price , or get the fuck over it .
what would you say to a piece of ralph &apos;s company ?
just think about it at least .
hello ? it &apos;s me .
what , are you still asleep ?
no , i was doing something .
i took john to dinner last night .
ralph &apos;s got a big problem , kid .
i thought you squashed it .
i did .
problem is , i don &apos;t know if john &apos;s hearing me .
what are you gonna do about it ?
me ? nothing .
what does that mean ?
i didn &apos;t say nothing .
we share the esplanade , tony .
i don &apos;t want that apple cart upset .
then somebody should do something about it .
i appreciate your thoughts .
you saying what i think you &apos;re saying ?
i didn &apos;t say nothing .
all right then , i &apos;ll talk to you .
twenty years , i &apos;ve been friends with john . now he &apos;s gotta go .
all over a stupid joke .
i was fucking around . for christ &apos;s sakes !
you &apos;ve never made a joke about ginny sack ?
not like that .
of course not .
fuck him and his highfalutin bullshit .
who does he think he is , sir walter raleigh ?
that &apos;s enough of you and your stupid fucking remarks !
go back to miami and play volleyball , whatever the fuck you do down there ...
while we clean up your fucking mess !
maybe even keep your ass alive .
a mole on her ass ?
what &apos;s the joke ? i still don &apos;t get it .
it &apos;s not a joke , per se , it &apos;s ... you had to be there .
real lack of standards , your generation .
my day , john was right . a man wouldn &apos;t be expected to stand for such a remark .
fucked up thing is i don &apos;t even like ralph .
if he was drowning , i &apos;d throw him a cinderblock .
but not protect one of my own captains ?
besides , it &apos;s too late anyway .
carmine gave me the nod .
on johnny ?
that one &apos;s a slippery fuck .
him and those big fish @-@ lips of his .
look at this .
the fifth question and the poor prick used all his lifelines .
john goes ... carmine &apos;s gonna position himself for maximum deniability .
so you make it easy for everybody , take it out of the neighborhood .
what , like an accident ?
accident , stickup .
he could choke on a chicken wing .
the important thing , johnny disappears .
with johnny out , carmine &apos;s gonna put his son in there .
fucking brainless ii .
who knows ? maybe there &apos;s an upside to johnny going .
he goes to boston a lot , to visit his father .
could happen up there .
you want my advice ? you &apos;ll call lou dimaggio .
the atwell avenue boys .
what , those sick old fucks in rhode island ?
they may be old , my little nephew , but those dogs can still hunt .
my old man used to talk about them ... something to do with drugs .
heroin .
back in the &apos; 50s , it was raining cash with that shit .
dimaggio and his crew never saw a dime .
the guy they worked for , lenny caputo , he didn &apos;t believe in it .
for 15 years ... everyone and their mother was getting rich dealing h.
everyone except these guys .
they &apos;re eking a living doing hits , running swag .
anyway , lo and behold , one day ...
lenny gets pinched for heroin trafficking .
it turns out the cocksucker &apos;s been making a fortune ...
working with the mulignon , and not only that ...
he &apos;s been selling out his own guys to the feds ...
so he can keep his ass out on the street .
dimaggio and another guy in his crew did eight years on a murder rap .
so much for loyalty .
you go to rhode island , and whatever you do , don &apos;t mention drugs .
coke , heroin , not even tylenol .
so , what happened to this lenny prick ?
lou dimaggio . his real name is galina .
they called him dimaggio when lenny and his wife were found ...
with their heads bashed in by a baseball bat .
anyway , that was lou , while he still had his health .
we could do this ourselves . ninja style .
father ?
we &apos;re here to see lou dimaggio .
come in .
hello . silvio dante , we spoke on the phone .
chris moltisanti , how you doing ?
my name &apos;s chris , too .
yeah ?
are you into drugs ?
what ?
no . what do you mean ?
we don &apos;t work for drug dealers .
no .
of course not .
want some coffee ?
no thanks .
rose ?
yeah , pop ?
more sanka .
anyway , this is him .
john sacrimoni .
he &apos;ll be coming up through here , next few days .
he stays at the boston harbor hotel .
the guy on the left .
it &apos;s my birthday , too .
we &apos;re having cake later .
carvel .
chromosomes . runs in the family .
there was a guy once , tommy neri .
got him coming home from the track one night .
caught him good with a tire iron .
when he woke up , i held him down ...
while frank cut his head off with a hacksaw .
silent as a mouse pissing on cotton .
if you like ... we could arrange to have that same thing happen again .
i don &apos;t know that we need to be that overstated .
what did you have in mind , then ?
nothing fancy , as long as he disappears .
it &apos;s your money .
yeah , about that . $ 20,000 , we said .
half up @-@ front .
so ,
we &apos;ll call you , then ?
pop , father &apos;s here .
would you like some cake ?
actually , we got a long ride back .
have you seen my sweater , the cable @-@ knit ?
the white one ? it shrunk , i put it in the bag for goodwill .
i told you i was gonna bring it up to dad .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s in the basement , near the card table .
hello ?
it &apos;s me .
i just hung up with the guy , jerry , from fort lauderdale .
that guy we &apos;re looking for , he &apos;s at the del ray hotel in miami .
our friend with the paving problem .
send someone over there tomorrow to take care of it then .
are you sure you want to do this ?
i &apos;d feel a lot better with the pope &apos;s blessing .
just do as you &apos;re told . i &apos;ll deal with the fallout .
who was that , hon ?
nobody . plumber for the store .
what &apos;s that you &apos;re making ?
fruit salad . you want some ?
low @-@ fat whipped cream .
no . you enjoy it , sweetie .
why did i have to come ? he &apos;s not even home .
look who &apos;s here . carmela , anthony , how you doing ?
we were just passing by , i figured we &apos;d give it a shot .
no , we weren &apos;t .
come , i show you .
i was working in the yard , clear the weeds .
next year , i &apos;ll grow grapes for the falanghina .
gonna make my own wine .
it &apos;s gorgeous , fur &apos; . so , that &apos;s the garage in question .
anthony , don &apos;t wander off .
but i have to go to the bathroom .
just stay put .
we &apos;re leaving in five minutes .
you &apos;re thinking of making that an apartment for your parents ?
a garage , i don &apos;t need it .
one time , back in naples ...
i work in the garden as a landscaper for a very rich man .
just me , i work there alone , growing olives .
my hands in the dirt ... the hot sun .
i was never so happy in my life as when i work at that place .
sometimes , i get the smell of olives ...
in a restaurant , in the store maybe .
it makes me very sad .
you know , i &apos;m not sure , but i think if it was built before 1938 ...
you can apply for a zoning variance .
&quot; pre @-@ existing , non @-@ conforming structure , &quot; i think it &apos;s called .
i just got it back from the martinizing .
they do a nice job over there .
say hi to dad for me . i put allegra &apos;s graduation picture in a frame for him .
love you .
i love you , too .
careful driving .
shit .
it &apos;s me .
hello ?
why is the door unlocked ?
jesus , you scared the shit out of me .
what are you doing ?
i thought you left .
i forgot the sweater .
what are you doing on the floor ?
nothing . i was getting the laundry together .
what the hell &apos;s this ? i thought you &apos;re on the atkins .
i was ! i am ! it &apos;s hard , john ! i &apos;m trying !
this is how you try ?
i &apos;m not out of the house 10 minutes !
i was dizzy , i was having low blood sugar .
what happened to the fruit salad ?
you were supposed to quit smoking and didn &apos;t !
nicotine &apos;s an addictive substance !
what &apos;s wrong with you ? why are you yelling at me ?
did i ever ask you to go on a diet ? did i ask you to be thin for me ?
the fasting , the nutrisystems , those goddamn deal @-@ a @-@ meal cards ?
it &apos;s the world , john . our culture .
fuck that ! do you have any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
what do you mean ?
you lied to me ! you lied !
i know i &apos;ve gained weight these last few years .

at least it &apos;s not just jason who &apos;s regressing .
soprano ? his own daughter was going through the same thing .
i felt like such a fraud giving him advice .
my own son has three years on his daughter ...
and look how he &apos;s acting .
jen , why do you still feel guilty ?
sometimes i wonder ... if richard had a point .
i shouldn &apos;t have gone down into that garage that late at night .
i went to see sask at school the other day ...
and i &apos;m in the parking garage over there .
i was driving around for 20 minutes ... when finally i spot someone leaving ,
this big , bluto sort of guy .
i must have crowded him as he headed for his car .
anyway , he turned around ... and became quite confrontational .
and for a second , i &apos;ll admit , i thought of you .
what are you getting at ?
parking garages are not inherently dangerous places .
you cannot blame yourself for what happened to you .
turns out this guy was probably another parent ... or , more likely , a repairman .
but if he had dragged me out of my car and beaten me up ...
would i be saying , &quot; gee , i shouldn &apos;t have tried to park my car ? &quot;
anyway , enough about him .
let &apos;s get back to you .
you wanted to see me ?
you can tell ralph i &apos;ve decided to accept his apology .
you know that kid you pissed on ? donny k ?
he &apos;s got fucking nerve damage on his left side .
i &apos;m sorry , tony .
i bet you are .
i &apos;ll expect to hear from ralph , then .
why the big reversal all of a sudden ?
no more weight remarks , tony .
they &apos;re hurtful , and they &apos;re destructive .
i agree .
still awake ?
i &apos;m just reading .
bought you something .
what &apos;s this for ?
no reason .
i don &apos;t know if i believe that .
put a call in to ginsberg , by the way .
he &apos;s back from california .
tony , this is beautiful .
what size is this ?
i don &apos;t know , small .
i don &apos;t know if this &apos;ll fit .
try it on .
see ? i knew you could pull it off .
you look like a model .
listen to him now .
i &apos;m sorry , tony .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i can &apos;t , the music .
meadow , turn it off !
what ?
the music ,
will you turn it down , please ?
i &apos;m going out .
