第六季 第八集
If you had asked me six years ago what I would be doing now,
it would not be running for State's Attorney.
州检察官候选人
Let me see a show of hands.
If the election for State's Attorney were held today,
how many of you would vote for Alicia Florrick?
That's seven for and, I imagine, five against.
I'm not really against her. I just need to hear more.
I'm just voting for her here because I like her,
but I don't know much about her.
Well, let's explore that, Rita. What is it you like about her?
I guess how she handled her marriage.
She stood by her husband.
See, that's what I don't like about her.
Why didn't she divorce him?
He slept with all of those prostitutes, and she just grins.
That's what you do, through sickness and health.
What I don't get is what this has to do with her being a State's Attorney.
It matters if she's a doormat.
It matters if she has...
Okay, all right. I want to turn, uh,
to another subject, if I may.
Frank Prady. What do people think of him?
Who's that?
Oh, yeah, him-- the guy on the news. He's good.
Is he running?
He hasn't make his announcement yet,
but the expectation is that he'll run.
I like him.
He's smart and funny.
So let me ask the same question. If the elections were held today,
how many of you would vote for Frank Prady?
Eight. So, someone switched sides.
Was it you, Reggie?
Alicia, where are you? We need to discuss this.
I have to do some work, Eli.
I'll meet you when I'm done.
Owen, what a surprise. Eli, I will call you back.
Your receptionist said I could wait in here.
No, I'm thrilled. Stand up.
Give me a hug.
What's wrong?
Nothing. How's your campaign?
Look, Owen, I'm sorry.
I should not have questioned your relationship with Phil.
I won't do it again. I apologize.
Thank you.
He's a good guy.
I bet he is.
And I'm not gonna hurt your campaign.
I know.
So, how's school?
It's good.
I have a case for you.
What do you mean?
One of my students-- she was raped.
She is going in front of the University Judiciary Committee today
to try and get the guy expelled.
She didn't go to the police
because she doesn't want to overturn her life.
She just wants him out of her classes.
Okay.
Oh, that sounds like a get-out-of-my-office okay.
No, no.
It's just that I'm taking a step back from my cases.
It just a few hours, sis.
She just needs an advocate to sit with her
during the committee, that's all.
Doesn't she know any other lawyers?
Not anybody that can be there in an hour.
An hour from now?
It's just a couple of hours total,
and having you there,
the Governor's wife, would really matter.
Oh, my God.
You're putting on the puppy dog face.
No, I wasn't.
I-I was... I was just... sitting waiting for your answer.
See? It's just me,
waiting.
So you don't have to show them anything?
No, no, you just identify yourself.
If you're not driving a car, you don't need all that.
What about the skag?
They can't search you?
Well, how much are we talking about here?
Um, one and a half kilos.
Whoa! Someone's having a big party.
Damn, man!
What do you got? Wow.
Okay, no. Look, they have to have cause to search your car.
It sounds bad because
you don't hear the beginning and the end of the tape.
And this is in the discovery?
Yes. They just sent it over.
And we have two weeks before trial.
Well, maybe the judge won't let it in.
It's hearsay without Trey.
No, Forfeiture by wrongdoing.
Trey was killed in an attempt to bury evidence. Therefore,
it will be admitted in.
What about the third voice?
There are three people on that wire.
Two of them are dead. There's still one.
Kalinda, any luck in finding him? Dante?
Not yet. He fled after the other two were killed.
Oh, Alicia, do you have a minute?
We'll be right back, Cary.
God, it's hard to be the defendant.
Don't ever do it.
I'll try not to.
Where are you, Kalinda? You're whispering.
Home.
Listen, will you tell me when you're heading out
so I can come back into work?
God, this is insane.
I know.
You know... there's one thing that they got wrong about the wire.
What?
There weren't three people on it, Cary.
There were four.
If this were any other client,
we would be advising him to take a plea.
But it's not any other client.
We might be doing him a disservice
by not advising him to take a plea.
You're wrong.
There weren't just three of Bishop's crew on that wire.
I was there, too.
I need to testify.
No. Cary, that is not a good idea.
I am the only one who can deny
that that tape reflects the full conversation.
Yes, and no one will believe you.
Attorneys always make the worst witnesses, Cary. You know that.
I know I have no other option.
I don't want to testify. I need to testify.
We need to mock this.
Hire someone to cross-examine Cary,
see if he holds up.
What, are you...? Alicia.
I thought you weren't taking any more cases.
I'm not.
I just need to hand-hold this girl for an hour,
and I'll be right in.
Alicia, this is so irresponsible. What is the case?
Rape.
Oh, great, because rape is never controversial.
Would it change your mind to know that Alicia Florrick's
law partner is being prosecuted by the State's Attorney?
What is he being prosecuted for?
For telling drug dealers how to avoid arrest for the sale
and distribution of $1.3 million in heroin.
I like that you can't go into work.
It's like I'm keeping you hostage.
Hello?
I know you're not alone, so make yourself alone.
Okay.
What's wrong?
Everything all right, Mr. Bishop?
My understanding is the Feds are now investigating me.
They're using the State's Attorney's investigation
to fuel their investigation.
How do you know that?
The point isn't how I heard it. The point is I heard it.
What do you know about it?
The Feds? Nothing.
This isn't just about me, Kalinda.
This is about Cary, too.
They're coming after me through him.
No more candy.
Okay, well, let me do some research first.
Fast.
Kalinda?
I have to shower.
What's so secret?
Just work.
Okay.
I went to a party at the Theta house.
It was supposed to start their Thanksgiving food drive.
I was only going to bring canned stuff.
Sorry, I'm not used to talking like this.
But Troy was there,
and he said I should at least stick around for a little while.
I remembered all the Red Zone stuff
they told us at orientation
about how many freshman girls get, you know,
assaulted in the first few months of school
from drinking too much.
But I was careful.
I got my own drink, I didn't put it down.
I woke up in an upstairs bedroom... naked.
I was on the floor.
Troy was on the bed, asleep.
I couldn't find my clothes.
I couldn't...
Would you like to stop, Jody?
No.
Uh, when I looked down,
he had ejaculated on me.
Jody, you're lying.
That's not what happened!
This will destroy my future. You can't just lie!
Excuse me, sir. You can't interrupt my client.
Actually... Hello, Ms. Florrick.
You're here as a silent advocate.
You-you can't say anything.
Yes, but he's the accused.
It's not his right to interrupt her.
Actually, it is his right.
According to the Student Handbook,
he can participate.
It is true. He raped me.
I tried to call my parents the next day...
It was consensual.
Maybe you had too much to drink or something.
I didn't have too much to drink, and I said "No."
You just didn't want to hear it.
How much did you have to drink, Jody?
Two to three beers.
No, tequila.
Are you used to drinking, Jody?
Excuse me, panelists.
Mrs. Florrick, we've already warned you.
You're a silent advocate here.
Yes.
I just need a bathroom break.
How are you?
Okay.
No, not so good.
I know.
I'm sorry I didn't get to introduce myself. I'm Alicia.
I know. Your-your brother said.
Jody, you're doing well, but here's the thing.
I can't say anything here,
but you can, so I need you to tell them something.
What?
The Student Handbook--
it says Troy can participate,
but only with questions, not with statements.
Yes.
He's making statements.
He can only do that when he's questioned.
Can you say that the next time he talks?
I'll try.
Good.
One more thing.
What's your phone number?
I didn't have tequila. I had beer.
Jody, that's not true. I saw you drinking tequila.
You were downstairs in the kitchen.
Excuse me.
He can't do that. He can't interject like that.
Unfortunately, he can, Jody.
No, he can only interject with questions,
not statements...
according to the handbook.
It says so on page 38, paragraph C.
Okay. Troy, please limit your remarks to questions.
I'd like to bring you back in a couple days to continue our talk,
but I just wanted to get your last impressions of Alicia Florrick.
Uh, why don't we start with you, Sally?
I don't know. She seems entitled to me,
like the world owes her something.
And why do you say that?
Something about her.
She just seems selfish,
like everything is about my pain, my achievements.
There's a world bigger than you, you know...
Alicia, hey. Hi. You made it.
No, keep it running.
No, we'll summarize for you.
It didn't go well.
No, it went well. What-what do you mean?
I'm selfish.
That's just her. Stuck-up bitch. Everybody liked you.
Yeah, the real problem's Prady. His brand is just as strong.
And he's announcing this week.
Truth is, he'll get a big bump
from his announcement, so, we have to step on it.
What he means is, we need an event to coincide with his announcement,
so that he doesn't own the day.
We're spitballing ideas. Peter is willing to help,
perhaps make an announcement of his own or something.
Did you tell her I started my own firm?
What?
That lady. Did-did you tell her
I started my own firm? It wasn't handed to me.
Alicia, stop it.
It is one woman in a focus group.
Don't obsess.
Other people nodded when she said that.
No one was nodding.
Play the tape again.
No.
We're going home.
You're sleeping with a federal agent.
We followed you.
You left the apartment of Deputy Agent Delaney.
Yes.
Why?
This pre-dated anything to do with Cary.
Or you.
That does not calm me.
Agent Delaney is not working on your case.
The Feds are opening another front.
They're feeding information to the State's Attorney,
and the S.A. is feeding information to them.
And how do you know that?
Because I'm paying attention.
This is what I need from you, Kalinda.
I need you to find out what your girlfriend is working on.
If you want me to feel calm about you sleeping with a federal agent,
find out what case she is on.
You understand?
Good.
Now get out.
Fantastic.
Where are your chairs?
Oh, they, um... they arrive tomorrow.
How you feeling?
How do I feel? I feel like
a... newly-minted lawyer
ready to represent DUIs and bail-jumpers.
You seem happier.
I'm always happy.
Do I seem entitled to you?
Do I think you're entitled?
No.
Why? Do you, uh... do you feel entitled?
It's the focus group on my candidacy.
Someone said I seem... selfish.
Do you know this person?
No.
Well, then what do you care? Come on.
Well, it's a voter.
And also maybe the people who know me are being too polite.
She said I seem obsessed with my own pain,
my own achievements.
Yeah, my ex-wife used to say the same about me.
Really?
You don't seem that way to me at all.
Thank you.
So you want to do something about it?
What? Being entitled?
Yeah. Every Wednesday,
I go to St. Paul's Cathedral on Ashland.
They have a soup kitchen.
Go volunteer.
They always need someone.
It helps you see beyond yourself.
You do that every Wednesday?
Yeah.
You're a good person.
A saint, really.
You can say it.
Just go.
Turn up at, uh, 6:30.
Well, I'll think about it.
I think I might have been wrong about Alicia.
Sure, she has some money,
but she gives to those less for...
I'm Hank Shetty.
I work as the captain of campus police here
at Polytech.
Jody first came to you with her accusation?
Yeah. On Monday.
I guess it was three days after it happened.
And did you notice anything about her?
Yeah, she was in control.
She said she was raped
and she wanted to bring charges against Troy over there.
I asked if she wanted to have a rape exam administered.
She said no.
I was surprised by that. I asked her what had happened.
She didn't know the guy's name.
She was kind of confused about it all.
She said she had been drinking.
I think I suggested she go to the cops,
but she insisted no.
Mr. Shetty,
do you have any rape kits?
Why don't we let Mr. Shetty finish his statement, Jody.
I thought I could ask questions at any time.
That's what it says in the handbook.
That's correct.
Uh, ask your question again.
Mr. Shetty, do you have any rape kits in your campus facilities?
Do I... What do you mean?
You said you offered me a rape kit,
so I'm just wondering if you had any.
Any rape kits? No.
So why did you offer a rape kit?
What do you mean? I asked you
if you wanted a rape kit administered.
I know, but why, if you had no rape kits?
Well,
you know, we... could probably get a rape kit.
But you didn't want one.
Mr. Shetty,
was Jody crying when she came to you?
Or upset in any way?
No.
Even as she explained
how she was being raped, she didn't cry?
No, and I found that strange.
I asked that this panel hear testimony
from my counselor, Owen Cavanaugh.
So it is your opinion that this tape,
this recording, was selectively edited?
Yes. It plays the middle of the conversation
but not the beginning and not the end.
And you think Trey,
the man wearing the wire, did this for a reason?
Yes. He was arrested by the police.
He needed to give them someone
to lighten his sentence, so he gave 'em me.
Thank you, Cary.
I know how difficult this has been.
Uh, no further questions, Your Honor.
You may sit. Prosecution have any questions?
I do.
Hi. Cary.
Um, my name is Viola Walsh.
Yes, I know. Hi.
I just have a few questions for you, if you don't mind.
I don't mind. Shoot.
Shoot? Really?
I won't do that.
So, you worked as an assistant state attorney
before you returned to your defense work?
I did.
And you didn't... Okay,
um, let me figure out a way to say this without offending you.
You didn't work for Lemond Bishop
at the same time as when you were an ASA?
No. And don't worry about offending me.
Okay, good. That's a relief.
But you worked for Bishop
prior to joining the ASA's office?
I did. Well, I was on his defense team.
Um, yes, one of five lawyers.
So... you worked for Bishop
before and after you were an ASA?
I did.
Okay.
So we just have to account for 20 months
that you were at the ASA's office.
Objection. Attorney is testifying.
I'm so sorry.
I was just talking to myself, and...
and I won't do that again.
That's okay. Take care.
I wasn't gonna sustain it anyway.
Thank you.
Why did you lie to your workmate
and say that you never worked for Bishop?
I never lied.
Oh, well, I have a-a statement here, uh, in the discovery from ASA Pine
that when you took on the Bishop cases,
you said that you never worked on a Bishop defense.
Isn't that a lie?
No.
It's not? Then what is it?
She was questioning my work as a deputy,
and I wanted to stop her challenges.
So you could take Bishop's cases from her?
No, so I could stop her challenges.
But it was a lie.
No. I mean,
it's not a lie in the way that you mean it.
And how do I mean it?
You're trying to suggest
that I lied in order to keep working for Bishop.
Okay, but you just said it was a lie. So...
was it a lie? I-I... I mean,
we seem to have different interpretations of a lie.
Objection. Argumentative.
No, I'm okay with that. Sustained.
Oh, I mean overruled.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Cary,
what is your definition of a lie?
Look, all I'm saying
is I didn't say it to deceive her.
I mean, I didn't say it to cover up for the fact that I was...
Go ahead, Cary. Take your time.
I know that you want to tell us all the truth.
Look, I wasn't working for Bishop, and that's the truth.
So how much did you make
at the law firm prior to the SA's office?
$85,000 a year.
And how much do you make now?
Well, it changes.
I have a draw of $350,000,
and then there's profit participation...
$350,000.
And how much did you make as an SA?
$38,000 a year.
And yet you could keep your apartment.
Your $4,000 a month apartment.
That's more than you were making every year.
So how did you pay for that?
Savings.
Really? Savings?
I wish I could save like that.
So let's talk about the two kilos of cocaine
that you never returned to evidence.
I already went through that. I didn't return it
because it was taken.
And you realize
that this is the cocaine that allowed Bishop to go free.
Once the cocaine disappeared, Bishop got off...
scot-free.
Okay, let's call a halt to this.
Um... I think we should talk, Cary.
Jody was very clear about what happened.
She came to me the very next day.
Was she confused? The campus office said
she was confused about what happened.
No.
She knew who raped her.
She didn't want to go to the police,
but she didn't want to have to face him
in school every day either.
I want you to know
the campus cop was composing his erection.
I'm sorry, what?
Yes. Huh, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
That almost sounds as if it was auto-corrected.
This man is her counselor.
He has reason to lie.
Again, the only interjection allowed is a question.
The campus cop was completely wrong in his assertions.
I saw her the next day,
and she knew exactly what happened.
You failed me.
You d... you don't like me. This is unfair.
I have done nothing wrong.
No, what's unfair is you talking
and not allowing us to question you.
She was drinking too much.
All right, all right, that's enough.
That's enough.
The panel is ready to deliberate and offer its decision.
Excuse me.
We still have witnesses.
Mrs. Florrick,
we have already warned you about staying silent.
Unfortunately, Jody,
there isn't enough evidence for an expulsion.
We want to be clear.
To say there isn't enough evidence
does not mean he is innocent, Jody...
Excuse me. There has been a complete lack
of due process here,
and you have opened yourself up to a lawsuit.
What?
Title IX requires
due process in campus allegations.
You are subject to suit for not supplying that.
Are you suing us?
Is that what you're doing, Jody?
Yes.
No.
I mean, it's not a lie in the way that you mean it.
Oh, and how do I mean it?
You mean that you're trying... you're trying to suggest
that I lied in order to keep working for Bishop.
Mine or yours?
We need to stop working so hard.
Hello.
Yeah.
Hold on.
Be right back.
No.
Because I said no.
The same with the SA--
you use him to get to Bishop.
We can't. We don't have legal cause.
Wait till the tap...
Alicia Florrick is bringing a lawsuit against Chicago Polytech
on behalf of a student for rape.
Does this change anybody's vote for or against her?
Is she bringing those charges now?
Yes. I'd be more likely to vote for her.
Rape on campus is everywhere...
What, so she's kind of a feminist activist now?
Why does she have to be a feminist activist
to bring charges for rape?
He's not saying that.
Is she running or is she not?
How fitting that the men in the room
are the ones having problems.
Your Honor, all plaintiff wants is an emergency injunction
to change the makeup of the university panel.
Is there any reason
this can't be delayed until next week?
Not as far as we're concerned, Your Honor.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Uh... Sorry.
Your Honor, uh...
It's all right, I have to get used to...
doing this for myself. Uh, Your Honor,
I'm Louis Canning, outside counsel for the university.
Mr. Canning, yes. Are you all right?
Uh, I am. Uh...
I just had an unfortunate bout of kidney failure
from my tardive dyskinesia medication.
My Goodness. I'm sorry.
Unfortunately, Your Honor... Hello, Mrs. Florrick.
Mr. Canning.
Unfortunately, Your Honor,
uh, defense has to request that this case be expedited.
Your Honor, Chicago Polytechnic does not want
the negative publicity to impact their admissions process.
That's why they're asking this case be expedited.
I wish that were the case, Your Honor.
Unfortunately, I have my operation in a week's time
and I just want to...
make sure this is handled.
Mr. Canning, are you all right?
Yes, just, uh, uh...
dys-dyspnea from my, uh,
kidney failure. I-I know this is an inconvenience
to plaintiff's attorney, and-and I am sorry.
I also wish it didn't inconvenience the court.
Oh, stop it, Mr. Canning, it's...
no inconvenience at all.
We'll start hearing testimony on your motion to dismiss tomorrow.
Was any of that true in there?
I've missed you, Alicia.
You're fun.
Are you dying?
Well, everybody's dying.
Are you dying now?
No, I'm having a kidney transplant.
That's it.
See you tomorrow.
He's going in for a kidney transplant,
and she thinks he's lying.
She's not just selfish, she's paranoi...
Wow, look at you.
Best-dressed in the soup kitchen.
I just came from court.
You dress down well.
Oh, yeah, you know, I have a consultant.
So... the last one who shows
gets the pots.
Oh, this is just like home.
But less entitled.
Much less.
I can feel the selfishness melting away.
Hi, Eli.
We just found out from the Confetti Brothers
where Prady is announcing.
Uh, Eli, I'm busy.
Can I try to figure out what you're saying another time?
The Confetti Brothers are a duo out of Wisconsin
who control all the confetti for political functions.
They told us Prady is announcing at Bonaventure tomorrow night.
Okay, those words made sense. Can I go now?
What are you doing?
Scrubbing a pot.
Yes, I can see why you have to go.
We have a plan for Peter to meet you in a Bonaventure hotel suite
and for photographers to see you coming out.
You can't be serious.
Yeah, peter's already on board.
That'll become the story,
not Prady's announcement.
Okay. I'm going now, Eli. Bye.
Better look at this.
Hello.
Were you at the St. Paul's Cathedral last night?
Yeah, why?
There is a photo of you scrubbing an already-clean pot
and talking on the phone.
Oh, my God. Who took it?
I don't know. A tracker.
Why were you scrubbing an already-clean pot?
It wasn't clean.
I cleaned it.
Does it say it was clean?
It says it was clean.
And why are you dressed like you're going to a dinner party?
I wasn't. It was after work.
And I was on the phone with you.
You called me.
Alicia, this is a disaster.
You can't do photo ops like this on your own.
It wasn't a photo op. I-I was just helping out.
Well, you can't do that.
There are people out there trying to screw you.
Oh, my God, does it say it was clean?
You need to get in here.
We need to strategize.
No, I have to go to court.
I thought you delayed that.
No, I tried to delay it.
Alicia, I take my job seriously.
You need to take it seriously, too.
Oh, my God,
They're just making this stuff up.
For a politician's wife, she's kind of phony.
It's like they're not real to her--
the homeless people.
Yeah. Like animals in a cage.
She just went to that soup kitchen to show off.
Okay, good, I think
we've covered that thoroughly.
Let's move on to the wire.
The recording of your wrongdoing.
My alleged wrongdoing.
Your alleged wrongdoing. Now, the tape starts with you joking
about women, is that right?
No, that is not how it started.
That's when the C.I. decided to turn on the wire.
Are you saying that the wire was edited?
No. I'm saying the C.I.
edited it by choosing when to turn it on and off.
I talk much longer than the wire.
You did?
Because we only hear the end of your joke about Beyonce.
So what did you say about Beyonce
before the tape started rolling?
How is this relevant?
Cary.
No, seriously.
How is my joking about Beyonce relevant?
Wow. Okay, are we taking a break from questioning?
Let me talk to Cary for a second.
I'm just asking a question and what I don't get
is why you're not objecting more.
I'm not objecting
more because these are softballs
and if I object
it'll look like we're hiding something.
Well, I disagree.
Okay, that's it.
Let's take a break.
We'll, uh, pay for one more session.
Okay. When's his trial?
Two weeks.
All right, Diane, we've had our issues in the past.
That's why you've hired me.
But I have to tell you, he is a bad witness.
If I'm on the jury,
he's going away for 15 years.
I know. Thanks.
Anytime.
Cary,
whatever you have to do, whoever you have to talk to,
get your head in the game.
You are 14 days away from spending a decade in prison.
Do you understand?
I understand that I will be fine.
You need to protect me more on the stand.
Watch the tape.
Kalinda, close the door. It's me.
Cary.
Cary, this is a mistake.
Do you want to go back to jail?
No, I don't.
Then stop screwing around.
30 feet between us, Cary.
30 feet.
You cannot be here.
No one saw me enter.
And how do you know that?
Castro wants you in prison.
He could have cops outside.
Why do you lie to me?
Cary, take this seriously.
I am.
When I call you, you say you're home,
but you're not.
How do you know that?
Because you're with this Fed.
What are you doing?
Well, you came here to bang me, so come on, let's go.
Just...
Just act like you care.
For 14 days, act like I mean something to you.
You do.
Well, then show me and stop going to her.
Cary, come on, that's not what this is all about.
We don't do that to each other.
I can't think about anything else.
I need to save myself, and all I do
is picture you in bed with her.
Cary, we're not married.
We're not even going steady.
But you mean something to me.
Yes, I know I'm supposed to be a good sport,
but I don't want to be with anyone else.
I do.
Okay, well, that solves that.
Thank you and go to hell.
Cary, wait.
Let me check that nobody's outsi...
Jody had a fair hearing.
Most disciplinary sessions last
less than an hour.
Really?
And how long did Jody's session last?
Five hours over two days.
My Goodness. That sounds like
due process to me.
Objection. Counselor is testifying.
Poorly, too.
Do you have anything else to say, Mr. Canning?
Uh, no, I'll just rephrase. If I may.
Um, the student judiciary committee
has a lot of regulations, right?
Yes. We have a detailed manual.
That would be this heavy thing right here, right?
That's right. 250 pages.
Uh, it lays out all the rules.
And is one of the rules that a-a complaining witness like Ms. Milam
is entitled to a silent advocate
as long as the person doesn't interfere with the participants?
That's correct.
Did Mrs. Florrick interfere with the proceedings?
Objection. I am not on trial here.
One second.
Can you tell us the level of training
you received to sit on this panel?
We all attended a weekend seminar.
An entire weekend?
Objection.
Sustained.
We were also provided with training videos.
And were these training videos specific to sexual assault?
No.
Were you appointed to this panel, Ms. Booth?
No, I volunteered.
Have you volunteered to get any additional training
pursuant to sexual assault?
It wasn't required.
No more questions.
Have you ever served on a jury?
Yes. Twice.
A murder trial and an embezzlement case.
Did you have any experience in either of those things?
No.
Yet you and your fellow jurors
were able to reach a verdict both times?
Yes.
Thank you. I have no further questions.
Ms. Booth,
at the start of both trials,
did you receive instruction from the judge?
Yes.
And were both sides able to put up expert witnesses?
Yes.
Prior to the sexual assault hearing for Jody Milam,
did you get
any direction or instruction?
No.
Did you call upon any expert witnesses
to clarify any medical findings?
No.
No further questions.
Let's move on to the wire,
the recording of your wrongdoing.
My alleged wrongdoing.
Okay, your alleged wrongdoing.
Now, the tape starts...
How are you?
Not good.
I know; I saw it.
Lawyers make the worst witnesses.
How about you?
I'm Marie Antoinette.
Good for you.
I know you're not asking for advice, but I'm giving it anyway.
It's an injustice what's happening to you,
but you're lost in the indignation and the anger.
You can't see past them, and neither will a jury
if you don't get it under control.
Give the jury a chance to find the injustice themselves.
Coming off you, it reads like...
entitlement.
Thank you.
You'll be great.
Have you finished with your good works, Mrs. Florrick?
That pot was dirty, Eli.
I spent 15 minutes scrubbing...
Okay, sit down.
I just spent ten minutes giving someone else advice.
Don't ever do this again.
Eli, I went to the soup kitchen
because I'm sick of thinking about myself.
Mm-hmm. Then think about me.
Some voters think you're entitled.
Some voters don't know you yet.
You want to do some good? We make a photo op.
That's not doing a good deed.
Stop acting like this is about you becoming a better person--
it's about you appearing like you're a better person.
That's what the voters respect-- the image of it.
Oh, you think this is counterintuitive?
It is.
That's why you're bad at this and I'm good.
You think reporters want something original?
They don't. They want a pre-chewed story.
They want to be forced into a roped-off area
to get the best picture.
They want me to feed them a line.
Let me do my job, Alicia.
I'm good at it.
And if you really want to be a good person,
I'll tell you where to send the check.
Are we understanding each other?
You ready, Mr. Agos?
I am. Thank you.
Okay. According to your testimony,
your words on that tape were tantamount
to you just hanging with the cool kids?
Shooting the breeze, killing time?
Yes.
And you don't view your actions as criminal?
No.
Or ignorance of such severity that it might as well be criminal?
No.
Would you care to elaborate?
No.
Hi. I'm heading into court. Anything?
Yep. I was looking for more girls Troy assaulted.
I found something much better-- more rapists.
What?
There's a rape wall on campus.
I'm not following.
When a girl gets sexually violated,
she puts up the attacker's name on the wall.
Okay. But I don't think there's enough time for a class action.
No. The university is in the process of painting over the wall.
Can you get me photos?
Judge, not only is this so-called "Rape wall" inflammatory,
it's totally irrelevant.
He's right, Mrs. Florrick.
These names have nothing to do with whether the university
denied your client due process.
I agree, Your Honor.
Which is why we ask for leave to amend the complaint.
A class action against the university
for creating an unsafe environment.
Mr. Canning?
One-one second.
Mr. Bishop.
Hello.
What did you find out?
From Agent Delaney?
What is she working on?
Am I in danger or not?
You're not.
Are you sure?
What is she working on?
White-collar crime.
I don't believe you.
I need you to do something for me.
Next time you see Ms. Delaney,
I want you to put this in her wallet.
Why?
Because I'm asking.
Can I ask what it is?
No.
Look, Mr. Bishop, I'm telling you the truth.
She's not focusing on you.
Then put that in her wallet, and we'll be good.
I apprised the university of the progress of these proceedings,
and they gave me this statement.
Would you like to read it?
"A random search of Troy Anthony's dorm room
"uncovered a substantial quantity of marijuana."
Are you kidding me?
We were surprised.
He's such a good kid.
Keep reading.
"This, of course, is a gross violation of the code of conduct."
A random search, huh?
Yes.
It happens all the time.
"Pursuant to university guidelines,
"Troy Anthony...
"has been expelled, effective immediately."
So you see there's no reason for your...
lawsuit against Chicago Polytech to proceed.
Actually, there are 60 reasons--
that's how many names are on the rape wall.
You're running scared. We're just getting started.
No.
Jody, this is what you wanted.
Troy's... gone from your life.
I'm done.
When's your operation?
I don't know.
Haven't found a kidney.
Can I do anything?
Yes.
If I die...
Are you... going to die?
I don't know.
I'd like for you to visit my... wife.
She likes you, and, um...
this thing has been hard on her.
I will.
Here you go.
Oh, you need some silverware.
Here you are.
Hi, Ann.
It's good to see you again.
If you need help with your housing application later,
I'll have time. I'd be happy to help.
Come on, Ann, let's, uh, get you some salad.
The governor's wife spent time today
at St. Paul's Cathedral's food kitchen--
and she was quite a hit.
In related news, incumbent State's Attorney James Castro
announced today he was withdrawing from the race--
this as newsman Frank Prady announced he would be...
Well, thanks again, everyone,
for your patience these last few days.
I do want to ask you one more time
about your feelings toward Alicia Florrick.
Look, I've been all over the place about her,
and I'm still not thrilled that she's with her husband,
but... I like her.
I think she seems to care.
Not bad, huh?
Not bad.
Now we just have to beat Prady.
Tell me what to do.
You're not leaving, are you?
No.
That's good.
