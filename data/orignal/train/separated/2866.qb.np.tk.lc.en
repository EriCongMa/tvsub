will you please tell me what it is that made you so mad at me ?
i don &apos;t know ! i don &apos;t remember !
what do you mean , you can &apos;t remember ?
i was so focused on being mad at you , i forgot what it was i was mad about .
if you can &apos;t remember , can &apos;t we just forget about this ?
oh , no . i am mad at you . i know that much .
but i &apos;m sorry about the fat @-@ ass thing because you have a sweet , little heinie .
i &apos;m getting pretty tired . you &apos;ll have to take over soon .
we &apos;ve been driving for a half @-@ hour .
you haven &apos;t looked at the road once .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s out there .
maybe i just need lunch .
you wanna eat ? my treat .
isn &apos;t that ross &apos; money ?
ross &apos; treat .
where do you wanna eat ? i don &apos;t know .
i know how we can decide .
i &apos;ll ask you questions.and then you have to answer real fast .
so clear your mind . clear it right out . clear it out .
it &apos;s all clear except for this image of a small , purple lamp .
is that all right if that stays in there ?
i don &apos;t see why not . i guess .
you have to answer with the first thing that pops into your head , okay ?
would you rather be too wet or too dry ?
too dry .
do you believe in ghosts ?
no .
will this movie be my big break ?
no .
what ?
yes .
dude , you said , no .
i also said , yes .
this won &apos;t be my big break ?
no .
i don &apos;t believe this .
look , i just don &apos;t want you to get your hopes up too high .
what are you talking about ? i &apos;m the lead in a movie !
they &apos;re not even paying you !
this doesn &apos;t sound like a real movie !
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re dumping all over my big break .
i don &apos;t think this is gonna be your big break .
are you on this trip to make me feel like a loser ?
i &apos;d rather be alone .
you don &apos;t want me here ? not if you &apos;re like this .
the next time you ask me a question like that , i &apos;ll lie .
i don &apos;t want you on the trip .
why don &apos;t you pull over . i &apos;ll get out now .
fine .
get out .
you can &apos;t stop on a bridge .
get out !
fine !
wait ! wait ! there &apos;s no sidewalk !
yeah . i &apos;m gonna die here .
are you mad at me because my hair gel smells ?
no
because i said your handwriting is childlike ?
no . that made me feel precious .
because he &apos;s always correcting people &apos;s grammar ?
&quot; whom , whom . &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s &quot; who &quot; !
yeah ? sometimes it &apos;s :
did you beat him at a board game ? he &apos;s such a baby when he loses .
okay , i &apos;m the baby .
hey ! stop it !
what are you doing here ?
joey kicked me out of the car on the bridge .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . he went crazy .
we played that game where you ask questions and answer fast .
that game should not be played without my supervision .
i don &apos;t know what made him mad .
all i said was that this wouldn &apos;t be his big break ...
... that it wouldn &apos;t do anything for him ...
... and that it didn &apos;t sound real .
okay , he should &apos;ve pushed me off the bridge .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
i figured you &apos;d be mad at me ...
... so i got gifts that i found on the roadside .
who wants the one @-@ legged teddy bear ?
i do !
okay
not even close .
i need help ! i can &apos;t do this .
come on . let &apos;s do it .
sit down . all right ,
put your head back .
now open your eyes .
okay , they are .
how many fingers am i holding up ?
four .
i was thinking four .
really ?
yes !
why don &apos;t we start with a practice one .
no drops .
great !
on three . one , two , three .
my pillow &apos;s all wet !
well , you said it was practice !
why did you move ? i knew you were lying !
come here .
what are you doing ?
stop it ! oh , my god !
i am going .... turn it over !
i am going to get ... get these drops in your eye .
oh , my god ! you really are freakishly strong .
stop ! stop ! stop it !
damn , it &apos;s empty !
if joey and chandler walked in now , we could make a fortune .
that is definitely chandler , joey or ross .
or rachel .
hello
it &apos;s joey .
chandler told me what happened . he &apos;s really upset .
not as upset as he &apos;ll be when he finds out what i did with his sweater vests .
what did you do to them ?
there &apos;s a well @-@ dressed pack of dogs in ohio .
i gotta ask phoebe something about the car .
hold on one second .
hey , dude .
hey , phoebe .
this wooden box keeps sliding out . what is it ?
my grandma .
and thanks . she &apos;s having a great time .
is that joey ? let me talk to him .
chandler &apos;s here . he was wondering if
i guess he ran out of change .
how am i gonna apologize to him if he won &apos;t even talk to me ?
send him something .
so when he gets there , he &apos;ll know you &apos;re sorry .
that &apos;s a good idea . i wonder where i could get a basket of porn ?
no , don &apos;t say , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , &quot; with porn .
you should send him a carton of cigarettes.because that way he can trade it for protection .
no . that &apos;s prison .
i know how we &apos;re gonna figure this out .
clear your mind ...
... and answer the first thing that comes into your head .
okay ?
do you like flora or fauna ?
fauna .
simon or garfunkel ?
garfunkel .
why are you mad ?
you said i was boring .
when did i say that ?
oh , my god ! i remember now ! we were playing chess .
phoebe , you and l have never played chess .
remember that time on the frozen lake ? we were playing . you said i was boring .
then you took off your energy mask and you were cameron diaz .
there &apos;s a chance this may have been a dream .
so this entire time , you &apos;ve been angry with me because of a dream ?
well , guess what , now i &apos;m mad at you .
i wanted to make sure this wasn &apos;t a dream.otherwise we &apos;re wasting our time .
stanley !
your leading man is here . let &apos;s get to work .
slight change of plans.we &apos;ve shut down .
what ? why ?
it &apos;s a money thing . we don &apos;t have any .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
what ?
it &apos;s probably just temporary .
we &apos;re hoping to get some money soon . just hang out .
hang out ? how long ?
i don &apos;t know . a week . maybe two .
the money will turn up.people always wanna invest in movies .
you &apos;re not rich ?
worth a shot .
well , joey , let me know where you &apos;re staying , okay ?
