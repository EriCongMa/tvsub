god , i thought it was you .
i heard &quot; grace &quot; and i was like , &quot; oh , god . &quot;
did you know her ?
no . i @-@ i mean , a little .
what happened ?
portia said she took a handful of her mom &apos;s sleeping pills .
no , she did it at the hotel
where she was supposed to go for the prom .
why ?
i think her boyfriend broke up with her or something .
they said she was in her underwear .
hannah just tweeted
it was aspirin , not painkillers .
did you guys see connor just checked in on foursquare ,
like , an hour ago ? at the library .
what are you doing at the library
the day after your girlfriend kills herself ?
ex @-@ girlfriend . they broke up last week .
did you see he changed his status to &quot; single &quot; ?
i know . she tweeted a picture of herself last week
after she dyed her hair red--
# yolo .
yeah , &quot; you only live once . &quot;
she sat two rows behind me in algebra last year .
i know it &apos;s kind of morbid ,
but i can &apos;t stop looking at her facebook page .
and who is this ?
mr. van zanten .
and you shot him four times in the head ?
yes .
why would you do that , mr. yates ?
because she wanted me to .
you &apos;re referring to the accused ,
gwyneth van zanten ?
yes .
you were her pilates instructor ?
yes ,
but she said she loved me .
if i shot her husband ...
we would be together .
with his money ?
objection . leading .
sustained .
and you ...
strike that .
why did m @-@ mrs. van zanten want you to shoot her husband ?
objection . ambiguous .
unfortunately , sustained .
o @-@ one second .
oh , did the accused offer you
anything in exchange for this murder ?
yes , she said we &apos;d split his money .
and did mrs. van zanten explain
why she wanted her husband killed ?
he &apos;s a rich ceo . they had a prenup .
if she divorced him , she got nothing .
but if he died ,
she got everything .
i see . and what happened after the murder ?
objection . calls for narrative .
ms. hellinger ,
you are now experiencing asa hazing 101 .
sustained .
thank you , your honor .
did you text the accused after the murder ?
i did .
and what did your text say ?
&quot; it &apos;s done .
our problems are over .
don &apos;t go home until 8 : 00 . &quot;
why not go home until 8 : 00 ?
to establish her alibi .
hello , this is the principal at capstone preparatory .
over the weekend , there was a tragic incident
involving a capstone student .
please take a moment to discuss this ...
hey .
hi .
a bit more rough and tumble than military court .
you &apos;ll be fine . just don &apos;t retreat .
you &apos;re either advancing or retreating .
hi , mom .
my daughter .
no , thanks .
grace . uh , hi . what &apos;s going on ?
i just got a call from school .
oh , yeah . grace baskin od &apos;d on pills .
oh , my god . when ?
last night .
we &apos;re all wearing yellow today .
it was her favorite color .
what happened ?
hey , mom , i have to get to class .
can i call you back ?
are you all right ?
yeah , i mean , it &apos;s sad , but i &apos;m good .
i &apos;ll call you back , okay ?
it &apos;s his fault .
i didn &apos;t even think he &apos;d show up at school .
and , look , he didn &apos;t wear yellow .
i heard he told her to get an abortion .
no , he didn &apos;t .
she wasn &apos;t even pregnant .
yeah , who told you she got an abortion ?
i don &apos;t know . someone re @-@ tweeted it .
is that even his car ?
i thought he was a scholarship kid .
he is .
i &apos;ve seen him on the bus .
do you think he blames himself ?
wouldn &apos;t you ? he breaks up with her ,
then four days later , she kills herself .
i know .
can you imagine ?
my client has stated that she was faithful to her late husband
and that they were happily married .
yet you claim she was having an affair with you ?
yes .
do you have any proof of this ?
any love letters ? any ...
mementos of this ...
torrid affair ?
no .
i see .
so we &apos;re to take your word for it ?
and this text you sent her-- that it was &quot; done &quot; --
what did she write back ?
she didn &apos;t . we talked in person .
ah . so ...
you admitted killing her husband ,
you admitted sending her a text admitting your guilt ,
and my client hasn &apos;t admitted a thing ?
objection , your honor , counsel is testifying .
yes , he is that .
sustained .
after you sent this text ,
my client immediately informed the police , didn &apos;t she ?
objection , your honor . counsel is still testifying .
not only that , he &apos;s asking for hearsay .
it goes to the defendant &apos;s state of mind , your honor .
actually , no . mr. gardner is asking
for the content of a conversation
between mrs. van zanten and a police detective .
if that &apos;s what he wants ,
he should put one of them on the stand .
oh , she &apos;s got you there , mr. gardner .
congratulations , ms. hellinger .
what were you offered in trade
for your testimony here , mr. yates ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t say it was a trade .
i received a plea bargain .
and what was the plea bargain ?
20 years .
for cold @-@ blooded murder ?
objection , your honor . argumentative .
yes . sustained .
and what is the usual sentence for first @-@ degree murder ?
objection , your honor . calls for speculation .
yes . sustained .
a murder like this usually draws a 45 @-@ year sentence ...
objection . counsel is testifying .
sustained again .
are you having trouble getting out what you want , mr. gardner ?
nicely played .
thank you .
we used to represent you .
yep . thank you .
go well in court ?
everybody feels bad for the underdog .
what about the person who &apos;s supposed to do well ?
no one talks about the pressure we &apos;re under .
so , what &apos;s up with you ?
you &apos;ve been away from work .
no .
mentally , you have . what &apos;s going on ?
oh , just , uh , personal stuff .
uninteresting .
huh . judge creary .
what are you doing ?
going to the restroom .
look , creary plays by the book .
then he doesn &apos;t have to talk .
kalinda , this single case could drag us out of bankruptcy .
i want to get a sense of where we stand .
oh , will gardner ! how the hell are you ?
judge creary .
no , uh , no , i &apos;ll call you right back .
will , hello .
giada , i ... i didn &apos;t know you were in town .
yeah , orren &amp; polk , second year .
his honor was just offering me some career advice .
do you know this bastard ?
i do . we met when i was at depaul ,
although we haven &apos;t spoken in a while .
what happened there ?
i don &apos;t know , i thought it was you .
oh , no , it wasn &apos;t me .
yeah , well , i &apos;d stay away from him .
he &apos;s a bad influence .
oh , i knew that .
will is a bad boy .
disbarred bad boy .
six @-@ months- suspended bad boy .
you should &apos;ve seen him in court today .
he was completely screwed up .
really ? i ... thought we more than held our own .
no , you &apos;re gone , you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re cooked ,
you &apos;re ... deep @-@ fried cooked .
why is that ?
your client-- she &apos;s guilty .
how do you figure , your honor ?
actus reus .
you &apos;re trying to make her out to be a saint .
she was cheating on her husband .
no , i &apos;m sorry , your honor , that &apos;s just not true .
i can &apos;t for the life of me figure why you wanted a bench trial .
except you &apos;d probably do worse with a jury .
his client is an ice queen .
looks something like this .
i mean it .
your honor , if you believe that ,
you need to recuse yourself .
ooh ! i love this one ! with his ethics !
love the ethics , will .
great for a disbarred lawyer .
bribing judges and stealing .
you know , if it was up to me ,
you wouldn &apos;t be allowed to practice law ever again .
maybe the thing is to agree to disagree .
yeah . yeah .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry , young lady ... for bringing my work here .
he didn &apos;t say that ?
he said i bribed judges and stole ,
our client is guilty , and i should never practice law again .
well , he was drinking .
which means he &apos;s only being more loose @-@ lipped about
with what he really thinks .
damn it .
gwyn brings her husband &apos;s fortune to us ,
it gets us out of debt .
i know , and it &apos;s a good case .
in front of another judge , we &apos;d win .
what are you thinking , the same thing ?
move for a recusal ?
he says no , you &apos;ve turned the judge against you .
he &apos;s against me already .
there will be fallout from the judicial community .
creary is beloved .
he was beloved .
judges know he &apos;s a loose cannon .
we win this case , we get out from under the trustee .
we could get the 27th floor back .
have cary argue the motion for you .
no , alicia .
will ...
it &apos;s not that .
i think creary &apos;s got a thing for the ladies .
oh . well , don &apos;t embarrass him .
ask for the conference in chambers .
have alicia move for the recusal there .
and if he says no ?
this should be interesting .
probably too late to take my advice back .
probably .
your honor ,
the defense requests an issues conference in chambers .
what do you need , counselor ?
we have a motion , your honor .
but it would be easier to present it in chambers .
oh ? and why is that ?
mr. gardner ?
it &apos;s a personal matter , your honor .
oh , really , a personal matter ?
what kind of personal matter ?
please , your honor .
well , in chambers it &apos;ll be on the record ,
mr. gardner , and @-@ and ... ?
alicia florrick .
ah , the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s wife .
very fortuitous .
in there and in here , it &apos;ll be on the record ,
so if you have a motion , let &apos;s hear it .
your honor , we move that you recuse yourself .
oh , really ?
now , why should i recuse myself ?
you have demonstrated bias against the defense .
still licking your wounds about those objections yesterday ,
mr. gardner ?
no , your honor , this is regarding the biased comments
you made to mr. gardner
in the bar , the arena , last night .
this is dangerous territory , mrs. florrick .
you called our client guilty ,
and you said that mr. gardner was a known liar ,
and that he should give up now because he would lose .
well , your motion is denied .
you have any further witnesses ?
your honor , you showed bias against us .
i have ruled on your motion , mrs. florrick .
you may sit down now unless you have another witness .
you &apos;ve given us no alternative , your honor ,
but to file a motion to substitute your honor for cause .
you what ? !
we are filing for a substitution hearing .
now , you sit down right now , mrs. florrick .
i have ruled !
and it is not up to you ...
no , sir , it is not up to you .
you have no further witnesses ,
then we will move toward ...
excuse me , your honor .
it is our right .
no , it is not your right to disrupt my court .
you &apos;re in contempt .
if i make a motion to substitute , your honor ,
then it is no longer in your hands ,
and you must transfer this matter to another judge .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve just done .
we do , your honor ,
but you &apos;ve given us no other choice .
everybody has a choice . everybody .
you &apos;re fishing for a mistrial here , and you won &apos;t get it .
you lose this motion ,
and i &apos;ll be right back here to judge this case .
we understand that .
so i &apos;ll give you one last chance
to step back over that line .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , but my motion has been made .
we move for a hearing into your bias
against mr. gardner and our client .
well , we &apos;re in it now .
we &apos;ve been ten percent more successful
in optimizing campaign page keywords ,
and that &apos;s resulted in a 20 % increase in organic search traffic .
we &apos;ve been employing the bluf tactic of networking design .
that &apos;s bottom line up front .
i would say this met with mixed results .
wait . there &apos;s been a 20 % jump in fund @-@ raising ?
how did that happen ?
uh , i.t. &apos; s been better managed .
by who ?
one of the volunteers .
hire him .
her .
do i care ?
you &apos;re hired .
what ?
just keep doing what you &apos;re doing .
good job , you guys , i &apos;ll need you to stay a little later .
you got it .
no problem .
where are you going , jay ?
uh , i have to get back home .
okay . tomorrow .
if i can .
all stand . court is now in session .
the honorable peter dunaway presiding .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
it &apos;s judge dunaway .
this is a hearing to determine whether judge harrison creary
is prejudiced against the defendant and defense counsel ...
... in people v. gwyneth van zanten .
asa hellinger ,
do you support mr. gardner &apos;s motion to substitute ?
no , your honor .
the people do not believe
judge creary has shown bias in this case .
then you will present the evidence against prejudice ,
mr. gardner &apos;s representative will present the evidence for it .
this hearing is , in effect ,
a trial within a trial ...
your honor creary , you don &apos;t need to be present at this hearing .
are you here to testify ?
uh , no , your honor .
i don &apos;t want to give this ...
mini @-@ persecution any more attention than it needs .
but i do want to face my accusers .
well , that is your right , your honor .
uh , judge creary &apos;s prejudice will be this hearing &apos;s
one and only issue , rules of evidence will apply ,
and my ruling will be final .
is that understood by all counselors ?
yes , your honor .
good . then we will begin .
hi .
i &apos;m grace .
uh , sorry .
uh , that &apos;s my real name .
grace florrick .
i &apos;m really sorry about the other grace .
what do you want ?
why aren &apos;t you in class ?
why aren &apos;t you ?
&apos;cause i saw you come in here .
look , i don &apos;t need anything , okay ?
we broke up . it was a while ago .
she didn &apos;t do it &apos; cause of me .
you know , you really shouldn &apos;t smoke .
you &apos;re the politician &apos;s daughter ,
the one caught with a hooker ?
he wasn &apos;t caught with a hooker .
class is in session . who &apos;s in there ?
shh .
come out now . right now !
if you don &apos;t want to get in trouble ,
come out right this minute !
they can &apos;t find us here .
i see you in there .
do you need me to deal with this , huh ?
all right . all right , bye .
sorry to keep you waiting , mr. saverese .
hey , no problem .
about your losing tow truck bid--
we can &apos;t sue strickler automotive ,
but we can appeal on the basis of fraud .
but just to warn you ,
they &apos;re probably going to say you cheated , too .
well , i thought your company
was protecting me against all that crap .
yeah . unfortunately ,
strickler &apos;s proven quite litigious .
now , there &apos;s a chance we may end up in deposition ,
so i have to ask you a few questions .
you were convicted on a drug charge .
cocaine . intent to sell .
and how many years were you in ?
two . it was canadians .
you know , they &apos;ve got soft hearts .
and ... you &apos;re not involved now in drugs ?
what &apos;s that suit you &apos;re wearing ?
suit ?
oh , it &apos;s calvin klein . why ?
you need a lot of suits like that to work here , do you ?
yeah . yeah , some .
but you don &apos;t wear suits like that when you &apos;re out and about ?
i mean , on weekends , you don &apos;t wear suits like that , do you ?
no .
good , &apos; cause then people might think you &apos;re gay or something .
oh ... you &apos;re not gay , are you ?
i &apos;m sorry if ...
is something ... the matter , mr. saverese ?
what , like you being gay ?
i don &apos;t mind gay people .
why don &apos;t we take this up tomorrow ?
why ? did i offend you ?
no . no , i just ...
i think we should take this up tomorrow
when alicia &apos;s back in the office .
sure . sure .
yeah . i mean , why not pay for two lawyers , not just one ?
yeah , that &apos;s , uh ...
that sounds good .
okay .
i was walking to the bar &apos;s restroom
when i ran into judge creary .
did you approach him ?
no . i was walking past him , and he called me .
and what did you talk about ?
he told me i was losing and that my client was guilty .
actus reus .
a guilty act ?
yes . i told him he hadn &apos;t yet heard all the evidence ,
and that &apos;s when he accused me of being a disbarred lawyer
and of bribing judges .
objection . your honor ,
if judge creary would like to testify , he is welcome ,
but he should refrain from editorializing .
excuse me . i think his honor has shown great patience , young lady .
i know what you think , your honor .
does that mean you overrule my objection ?
the gallery should remain silent .
how did the conversation end
with judge creary , mr. gardner ?
he told me , if it was up to him ,
i would never practice law again .
thank you , no further questions .
hello , mr. gardner .
hi , counselor .
you say judge creary accused you of being a disbarred lawyer ,
and that was untrue ?
yes , i was suspended for six months
but not permanently disbarred .
congratulations .
objection .
i &apos;ll withdraw that , counselor .
do you know what the first search result is
when you type &quot; will gardner &quot; into a chumhum search engine ?
that was a practical joke by an opponent .
would you mind reading what it says there ?
&quot; do you want &apos; will gardner disbarred lawyer &apos; ? &quot;
but , again , this is a joke .
but you can understand why he might mistake you
for a disbarred lawyer .
the fact that i was arguing in his court might suggest otherwise .
but it &apos;s no secret you &apos;ve had troubles this past year .
you were suspended for stealing money from a client .
is that correct ?
yes , but i replaced it .
judge creary called you a thief and a liar .
can you really say those characterizations are inaccurate ?
objection , your honor .
the question is whether or not judge creary showed bias
by making these comments ,
not whether or not they were true .
sustained .
wow , that &apos;s some defense .
our lawyer may be a thief and a liar ,
but the judge really can &apos;t say it .
objection .
sustained .
no further questions , your honor .
i &apos;d like to call judge creary to the stand .
he &apos;s had a change of heart and would like to testify .
you &apos;ve heard mr. gardner &apos;s accusations against you ?
i have .
and did you , in fact , call him a thief ?
no , i did not .
did you offer your opinions on the current case ?
i did not .
oh , my god , you &apos;re lying .
mr. gardner ,
you &apos;ll find yourself in contempt .
do you know why mr. gardner would be accusing you of this ?
well , i can only guess that he had ...
he had many objections sustained against him that day
and he thought i was biased .
but everything else he said about this ...
bar encounter is a lie ?
yes .
we need to find a witness from the bar .
hi .
hi .
that was nice , getting a call .
i &apos;m sorry , did i stop calling you or you stop calling me ?
no , i called you-- you just didn &apos;t return .
three times .
ah , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m a jerk .
mm , so ... how much is this one worth ? $ 80 a glass ?
no , four dollars .
things are tough in spain these days .
oh , of course .
how is the family fortune ?
reduced by 70 % .
ouch . things are not great all over .
no .
i read about your firm .
and you .
where are you going after this ?
where am i going ?
i don &apos;t know . what about you ?
i was gonna go home and read a briefing .
a big long brief about farm subsidies .
sounds like a thursday night .
light some candles , run a bath ,
read about the viability of ethanol as a fuel supplement .
how viable is it ?
pretty damn viable .
more so than you might think .
that &apos;s not bad for four dollars .
oh , i lied-- it &apos;s dominio de pingus .
it &apos;s $ 180 a glass .
i &apos;ll count pennies tomorrow .
why aren &apos;t you reading your e @-@ mails ?
i sent you three e @-@ mails today .
i am reading my e @-@ mails .
just not mine ?
well , i always know when it &apos;s important ,
you &apos;ll seek me out , and ...
here you are .
uh ... that one ... that one there .
click on it .
and now the attachment . click on it .
have you been hanging around schools , eli ?
it &apos;s not ours .
this is a tracker from the other side .
that always sounds so sci @-@ fi .
eli ...
it &apos;s the other campaign .
they &apos;re looking for vulnerabilities .
she was followed to school ?
this campaign has become about family values .
kresteva has a kid with leukemia--
he wants to make it seem
that you have a smoker who cuts class .
what is going on with my life ?
where are you ? we need you over here .
appreciate the opportunity ...
it &apos;s not about the opportunity .
the campaign needs you , jay .
things are falling apart here , and they &apos;re getting angry at me .
i can &apos;t work full @-@ time .
what about after school ?
did you see anyone follow you to school ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll call you again .
hey , n @-@ n @-@ no ...
this is so creepy .
i was sitting on a bench talking to a friend .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
who &apos;s the friend ?
connor .
who &apos;s connor ?
a boy .
grace ...
i &apos;m not smoking .
i know . i didn &apos;t say you were .
these trackers ...
they will find any opportunity
to paint you in a negative light , grace .
i know . is that it ?
mom ...
zach , could you give us a second ?
the girl who ...
committed suicide--
why ?
why did she do it ?
i don &apos;t know .
she was cutting .
she w ...
cutting herself ?
it &apos;s not that weird ; a lot of girls do it .
cut themselves ? why ?
why would they do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
self @-@ hatred ?
i ... i think it feels good to heal .
you would tell me if there &apos;s anything wrong ?
i &apos;m not cutting , mom .
i know .
it doesn &apos;t have to be that .
i just ...
i love you , grace .
i love you , too .
i know .
you &apos;re a good girl .
so , what do you need , will ?
what do i need ? why do you think i need anything ?
that look on your face .
you &apos;re beautiful .
oh , yeah ?
the other night with judge creary ...
what ?
no , i thought it was that .
he denied it . it &apos;s my word against his .
you were there .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re here ?
no .
but it wouldn &apos;t hurt .
this is why i am not gonna do it .
do what ?
testify for you .
creary was just showing off for me
and giving you a hard time &apos; cause we dated .
and you &apos;re the one who blew it out of proportion .
he said my client was guilty .
people say a lot of things .
you said that you returned my phone call .
so this is about not returning your calls ?
no , this is about not seeing the upside of crossing a judge .
the upside is : it &apos;s the truth .
and that &apos;s your real goal here ?
the truth .
we could subpoena you .
yeah , you could .
whoa . cary agos .
what , you come to tell us how the other half lives ?
still a $ 200 buy @-@ in ?
i don &apos;t know-- might be time to raise it .
so , you happy to be back at your old firm ?
ah , gardner-- he &apos;s got it out for me .
yeah ? man , he &apos;s got it out for everyone .
oh , yeah , your boss , he must be pissed .
you still clerking with creary ?
yeah . he is not happy .
but , well , he hasn &apos;t been happy for a while .
oh , yeah ? why is that , the double shifts ?
no , his wife .
well , i guess his ex @-@ wife .
is it fair to consider you a reluctant witness here , mr. chapin ?
it is fair to consider me both reluctant and really pissed .
because you &apos;ve been subpoenaed ?
yes .
and because i thought i was talking to a friend .
now , you are judge creary &apos;s law clerk ?
yes . i &apos;m sorry , sir .
don &apos;t worry .
after will gardner &apos;s suspension ,
what did you observe judge creary saying about mr. gardner ?
he called mr. gardner a liar and a thief .
and these are the same words that judge creary
denied speaking in their recent bar encounter ?
objection , your honor .
sustained .
to your knowledge ,
mr. chapin , is judge creary the only judge in cook county
who made derogatory comments about will during his suspension ?
no . everyone was talking about it .
and all the judges were joking about it , too .
which judges in particular do you recall made comments ?
paver , um ...
worth ... ferraro ...
judge john ferraro ?
didn &apos;t he recently rule in favor of will gardner
on a vehicular manslaughter suit ?
i believe so .
objection , your honor . relevance .
it &apos;s relevant because it proves
a judge is fully capable of putting personal feelings
about defense counsel aside when deciding a case .
i quite agree .
overruled .
we need to move off of the personal animus strategy .
the key is his prejudging our client &apos;s guilt .
well , what about the witness at the bar ?
she won &apos;t testify .
can &apos;t we subpoena her ?
i &apos;m not sure she &apos;ll tell the truth .
what else did your friend say about creary ?
you mean my ex @-@ friend ?
well , since creary &apos;s divorce , he &apos;s been struggling with alcohol .
going to aa ?
yes . why ?
are we sure we want to go there ?
i don &apos;t know .
if you go nuclear , don &apos;t leave missiles in your silo .
so , are you gonna go to the funeral ?
you should go to the funeral .
why are you so interested in her ?
what do you mean ? i &apos;m not interested in her .
all you want to do is talk about her .
i don &apos;t know .
i just feel bad .
i thought you didn &apos;t know her .
i know , but i could still feel bad .
it &apos;s just weird .
her being dead .
it &apos;s not weird .
do you believe in god ?
no .
why not ?
why is that funny to you ?
you &apos;re funny .
girls don &apos;t come here to ... talk about god .
they come in here to have sex ?
is that what she did ?
the other grace ?
uh @-@ huh .
we &apos;re not gonna have sex .
i didn &apos;t ask you .
you &apos;re right .
no .
so that &apos;s it ?
i &apos;m late to class .
tomorrow ?
yeah ?
oh , hi .
no , no , that &apos;s good .
do you mind looking into judge creary &apos;s drinking ?
okay . everything okay ?
yeah , my daughter &apos;s two steps away from dating keith moon ,
but everything &apos;s fine .
look , if you want to go out for a drink or
you want to speak , just give me a call , all right ,
and i &apos;ll get onto that .
all right , take care .
who &apos;s that ?
work .
the place where i work .
was it cary ?
it wasn &apos;t cary .
you need to give it a rest on the whole alpha male thing .
i don &apos;t understand .
how can we take a ten percent dive in i.t. ?
we were in the middle of a reorganization ,
and we &apos;ve hit a bump .
what bump ?
i lost my volunteers .
well , get new ones .
no , there was one i needed .
and what happened ?
he &apos;s in school .
he can &apos;t work anymore .
are you insane ?
he &apos;s in school and he can &apos;t work anymore ?
you tell him he has to work .
he &apos;s new . he &apos;s not very committed ...
okay , shut up .
is he here ?
where ?
jay , this is eli gold .
jay is a new volunteer .
where are you going ?
no , kid , you &apos;re staying .
mr. gold would like to offer you a job .
no , let him go .
damn it .
are you pacing me ?
another round , please .
two more beers ? sure .
want me to get her number for you ?
do you ever get jealous ?
do i get jealous ? yeah , why ?
of who ?
i don &apos;t know .
people i &apos;m dating .
when they meet someone else .
i &apos;m narcissistic enough to think
women should give up sex altogether after me .
you jealous of someone ?
how do you stop being jealous ?
you stop caring .
start seeing other people .
like anything , it wears off after a while .
yeah .
or ... you tell the person ,
&quot; i don &apos;t want you to see other people . &quot;
but then you have to be ready to back it up .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
that &apos;s a very genuine &quot; thank you &quot; from you .
i have to go to an aa meeting now .
hi , thank you .
welcome .
hello . welcome .
hi .
oh , is this your first time ?
at this meeting , yeah .
i usually go to the one across town .
that &apos;s great . well , welcome .
thank you .
actually , i &apos;m looking for a friend of mine , harrison .
do you know if he &apos;s coming tonight ?
i don &apos;t . he &apos;s usually here by now .
he &apos;s doing well , isn &apos;t he ?
thank you , mrs. vaughn .
do you attend alcoholics anonymous meetings
with judge harrison creary ?
mrs. vaughn ?
i do .
what does the judge share with the group at these meetings ?
your honor , this is truly outrageous .
alcoholics anonymous has a strict code of confidentiality .
yes , counselor , unfortunately , aa is not covered
by client , patient , or clergy privileges ,
and answers can be compelled here .
i don &apos;t agree with this , but the law is the law .
again , what has the judge shared at these meetings , ma &apos;am ?
he recently returned to addiction when his wife left him .
this is cruel .
and did he say what happened when he drank ?
he blacked out .
therefore , if judge creary had indeed prejudged
mrs. van zanten for-- what did he call it ? -- her actus reus--
and if he said as much to mr. gardner at the bar ,
then due to his blackouts , he might not remember it now ?
ms. hellinger , aren &apos;t you going to object ?
am i going to ... ?
yes . thank you , your honor .
sustained . leading .
no further questions , your honor .
i &apos;ll keep this short and sweet .
you want to work for your dad &apos;s campaign , i won &apos;t stop you .
but i can &apos;t speak for your mother .
now , if you want some advice
as to how to present it to your mother , i would offer it .
who &apos;s that ?
connor .
who &apos;s connor ?
grace &apos;s friend .
grace .
mr. gold .
about my mom .
yes , yes , the best way to present it to your mom
is that you &apos;re becoming a part of the campaign anyway .
you don &apos;t want to hate yourself by making your dad lose
when there &apos;s a chance you could help your dad win .
okay .
best not to say i was here .
you weren &apos;t here .
i am ready to rule .
this trial has been , above all , angering .
i believe the defense-- the ostensible defense--
at the moment it seems to be the prosecution--
they have resorted to rank character assassination .
they have inflicted on judge harrison creary a personal examination
that none of us could survive .
they ...
they have dug through his confessions .
they have subpoenaed innocent bystanders
and forced them to testify .
i am , to be frank , disgusted .
your honor ...
no , sit down .
unfortunately i believe the defense has proven its case .
i have doubts about judge creary &apos;s memory
of the evening in question .
to be factually correct does not mean to be right .
therefore , i am granting the defense &apos;s motion to substitute .
this case will be assigned to a new judge .
next time in front of a jury .
i think you &apos;ll want to consider taking a plea first-- 25 years ?
and why would we do that ?
because your client was cheating on her husband .
no .
actus reus--
it &apos;s not just latin for &quot; guilty act . &quot;
it &apos;s an online forum for cheating spouses .
that &apos;s why judge creary said &quot; actus reus . &quot;
before his divorce he visited the forum .
that &apos;s when he saw your client &apos;s profile .
still doesn &apos;t mean she killed him .
you &apos;re right , but we &apos;re checking the actus reus logs ,
and my guess is , we &apos;ll find somebody else
your client solicited to murder her husband .
or you can take the 25 years .
you know i share an office now .
so ?
so i don &apos;t think cary would appreciate
you sitting at his desk .
i &apos;ve just gotten word that the trackers are following zach , too .
yeah , we knew that .
yes .
i just wanted to let you know
that they &apos;re involving your children in the campaign .
i knew that , too .
i thought you might consider allowing them to be interviewed .
no .
if peter loses , you don &apos;t want your kids to blame themselves .
eli , i &apos;m tired .
please just go .
okay .
can &apos;t say i didn &apos;t try .
i won &apos;t .
oh . hey , i &apos;m sorry , buddy .
are you all right ?
i hope i didn &apos;t ruin your suit .
hey , sorry , sorry .
sorry about that .
hey , let , let me help you up .
what is that , calvin klein ?
hello .
i want to help with dad &apos;s campaign .
okay , let &apos;s talk .
i can help ,
and grace and i are already part of the campaign
whether we want to be involved or not .
i don &apos;t want to be part of the problem ,
i want to be part of the solution .
and how do you become part of the solution ?
by helping at the campaign office .
i &apos;d work on their computers after school .
it &apos;s only a 30 @-@ minute drive , and i &apos;d go straight there .
and you &apos;d only work in the campaign office ?
yes , mom ,
and i &apos;d still do my homework afterwards ,
everything , i promise .
should i come back ?
no , we &apos;re fine .
okay , i &apos;ll think about it .
okay .
you will ?
i will .
what was that about ?
you smell like cigarette smoke .
it &apos;s not me .
