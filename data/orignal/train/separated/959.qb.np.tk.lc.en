第三季 第十九集
maybe you haven &apos;t noticed , but i &apos;m in love with you .
victor caught gaby by surprise . &lt; / i &gt;
why would a four @-@ star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint ?
lynette took a gamble . &lt; / i &gt;
he has a history using cocaine .
no way .
he &apos;s been clean for almost a year .
and mike bet on love . &lt; / i &gt;
i win , you leave me and susan alone .
and lost . &lt; / i &gt;
don &apos;t panic .
but still came to susan &apos;s rescue .
you ok ?
yeah .
and mrs. mccluskey revealed &lt; / i &gt;
her secret for a lasting relationship ... &lt; / i &gt;
it was late on a tuesday night &lt; / i &gt;
when the power went out all over fairview . &lt; / i &gt;
for most of the residents , it was a minor inconvenience , &lt; / i &gt;
but for those with secrets , &lt; / i &gt;
the darkness proved quite useful , indeed . &lt; / i &gt;
millie russell was able to &lt; / i &gt;
indulge in another night of midnight binging . &lt; / i &gt;
timmy cooper was able to sneak &lt; / i &gt;
another peak at his father &apos;s adult magazines . &lt; / i &gt;
marilyn quinn was able to &lt; / i &gt;
steal a few more puffs of her forbidden tobacco . &lt; / i &gt;
but these secrets paled compared to the one &lt; / i &gt;
a certain old woman was hiding in her basement . &lt; / i &gt;
you sit tight , ida . i got batteries here .
i keep them in the freezer for just such an emergency .
i &apos;ll run them over to you .
by the way , you wouldn &apos;t happen
to have any extra ice laying around , would you ?
no , i just got some stuff in
my freezer i don &apos;t want thawing out anytime soon .
&lt; i &gt; yes , as a rule , &lt; / i &gt;
darkness helps us keep our secrets safely hidden . &lt; / i &gt;
oh , crap !
but every rule ... &lt; / i &gt;
karen , what happened ? are you ok ?
... has its exceptions . &lt; / i &gt;
when the lights went out on wisteria lane , &lt; / i &gt;
karen mccluskey wasn &apos;t the only resident left in the dark . &lt; / i &gt;
everyone else felt the pain of going without power , as well . &lt; / i &gt;
ow ! damn thumbtack !
susan , please let me help you .
oh , no , i got it .
wait , here we go .
that is hardly a long @-@ term solution .
at least it will keep me from stabbing myself while i look .
this is silly . why don &apos;t we borrow a flashlight from mike ?
mike ?
he &apos;s a plumber .
he &apos;s bound to have a spare .
sure , but we can &apos;t keep leaning on him for everything .
&quot; mike , we &apos;re drowning , save us ! &quot;
&quot; mike , it &apos;s dark , give us a flashlight ! &quot;
let &apos;s go ask gaby .
actually , i want to talk to him .
anyway , i thought we might ask him for dinner .
dinner ?
you know , as a thank you gesture .
well , you &apos;ve tasted my cooking .
it &apos;s not a thank you . it &apos;s revenge .
well , then i &apos;ll cook .
you told me i should put jealousy behind me .
i think breaking bread would be a great start .
well , let &apos;s not bother him tonight .
you know , i don &apos;t even need a flashlight .
my eyes have totally adjusted to the dark .
what was that ?
don &apos;t walk in the kitchen .
anyway , where is your sense of romance ?
a blackout , you have a defenseless lady ...
getting any ideas ?
well , i &apos;m starting to , yes .
it &apos;s funny , all that time
i wasted worrying mike would come between us .
it seems laughable now , doesn &apos;t it ?
kiss me .
hey , carlos , we had a blackout . you need a flashlight ?
carlos ? you ok ?
oh , sorry , man . i thought i heard a thud .
i just , um ... bumped into a chair .
i didn &apos;t think you were coming home till tomorrow .
no , the fish weren &apos;t biting .
so ... you got a girl in here ?
no . why ?
oh , because when i came home .
i thought i heard sex noises .
no , that was just me .
ok . good night .
god , that was close .
all this sneaking around is ridiculous .
mike and i dated for five minutes .
he &apos;s not gonna care .
what if travers finds out ?
look , i don &apos;t want him to be confused
until we figure out where this is going ,
i just think we should keep things on the down low .
i didn &apos;t say we had to stop , i just said we have to be quiet .
what , we should tiptoe around like school children
so our parents don &apos;t catch us doing it ?
i feel like i &apos;m 12 again .
i &apos;m just saying ,
i don &apos;t think the whole world needs to know our ...
12 ?
ok , look .
i will find us another place to rendezvous .
but i &apos;m not gonna skulk around forever .
ok , and no one &apos;s asking you to .
i respect you too much for that .
if you don &apos;t mind .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
i &apos;m going to be right there . here you go .
so can you still cook with the power out ?
of course . absolutely !
can you please tell me we can still make pizza .
no dice .
some genius installed pizza ovens with electric starters .
oh , this is awful . on a good night we barely break even .
tonight is going to kill the whole week .
not necessarily . the stove top &apos;s gas ,
i bought pasta for the staff dinner .
you give me ten minutes ,
i &apos;ll whip up a spaghetti carbonara
that &apos;ll knock their socks off .
oh , my god , you are a lifesaver .
and , since it &apos;s not on the menu ,
you can charge whatever you want .
say , 20 bucks .
for pasta ? are you crazy ?
won &apos;t hurt to ask .
i don &apos;t want to scare them away .
ok .
ok .
so , good news .
our chef is preparing his special spaghetti carbonara .
oh , yummy .
and we &apos;re offering that for $ 12 .
great .
for the appetizer portion .
the entree is 20 .
fine .
two . twenty @-@ two . ok .
shouldn &apos;t there be an emergency light ?
sometimes in these elevators there &apos;s a ...
ta @-@ da !
well , aren &apos;t you clever ?
i &apos;ll call hotel security , let them know ...
no , wait .
this is the first time i &apos;ve had you to myself all night .
i am sorry . it &apos;s those fundraisers .
everybody wants a piece of the candidate ...
what are you doing ?
taking my piece .
are you insane ? we &apos;re in an elevator .
exactly .
going down ...
oh , no . come on , cut it out .
the power could come on at any moment .
i know . that &apos;s what makes it so exciting . the risk .
but i &apos;m kind of running for mayor , remember ?
it &apos;s an elevator , silly . it has an emergency stop button .
i don &apos;t .
oh , my god , that &apos;s amazing . what are you doing ?
that &apos;s my phone . it &apos;s on vibrate .
oh , man , i was just starting to get into it .
less talking , more dressing !
you two ok ?
yeah , fine , thanks .
must &apos;ve gotten pretty hot in there .
you have no idea .
karen , don &apos;t worry about a thing .
i &apos;ll collect your mail till you get back .
how long &apos;s this blackout supposed to last ?
well , they say it may last for days .
days ?
hey , blondie , come here , come here .
listen , i don &apos;t really need to go to the hospital . i &apos;m fine .
you fractured a rib , and you might have a concussion .
you need to be looking after .
some of the stuff in my freezer might melt .
how about i just run out and get some ice ,
and then meet you at the hospital ?
ma &apos;am , you can replace groceries .
you don &apos;t understand ,
some of my groceries , they have sentimental value .
sorry .
i don &apos;t need to ask your permission .
ma &apos;am , no !
get your hands off me , you big ape !
get the restraints !
i &apos;m gonna sue your ass !
what are we waiting for ?
get me to the hospital . i &apos;m not a well woman .
what was that all about ?
your friend &apos;s afraid the stuff in her freezer is gonna spoil .
thank god the power &apos;s back on .
now she won &apos;t have to worry .
i made you waffles . eat them while they &apos;re hot .
what ?
will you marry me ?
they &apos;re just toaster waffles .
that was just the pre @-@ proposal , actually .
the real one will be much more romantic
with a diamond the size of a doorknob .
but just so you &apos;re prepared , i do want to marry you .
well , just so you &apos;re prepared , consider this my pre @-@ refusal .
come on . what &apos;s wrong . you wear my shirts ,
you burn my breakfast , you are here every night .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re married already .
we &apos;re having a good time . why risk ruining it ?
see , what happened to the thrill @-@ seeker
that seduced me in the elevator ?
she wouldn &apos;t be afraid of taking a little risk .
oh , you don &apos;t want to marry her .
she &apos;s a tramp . hold out for a good girl .
no , no , no . i found what i &apos;m looking for .
come on . what gives ?
look , victor , getting divorced really kicked my ass .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just ...
next time i get married , i &apos;ve got to be sure .
ok , i get it .
i just wish there was a way
i could prove how much i love and adore you .
well , if you can choke down
that lousy waffle i made you , that &apos;d be a start .
oh , there &apos;s mike .
shall we see if he &apos;s free friday night ?
yeah . yeah , why not ?
sure . you know what ?
do you want to run this ice cream inside before it melts ?
look , ian is going to come invite you to dinner friday .
you are not , i repeat , not going to accept .
why is ian inviting me to dinner ?
he wants to thank you for saving us
and to show that he &apos;s not jealous of you .
how &apos;s that for irony ?
i didn &apos;t plan to kiss you ,
but you didn &apos;t exactly resist .
i was in shock !
why were you so upset when you mentioned ian ?
because we had just had a fight ...
... about you .
really ? you talk about me a lot ?
mike , i am marrying ian .
we have hired a caterer .
we are going with the salmon ! so just back off !
hey , ian .
hi , ian . i just asked mike .
he can &apos;t make it .
yeah . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve got plans tonight .
oh , but didn &apos;t we say friday ?
friday ? oh , friday i &apos;m wide open .
splendid . shall we say , 7 : 30 ?
it &apos;s a date .
edie !
mrs. epstein !
listen , i &apos;m late for my hadassah meeting . here &apos;s the key .
take your time . oh , and don &apos;t be shy .
check out those closets , they &apos;re very spacious .
edie , what are we doing here ?
checking out a house .
i told you , i &apos;m not looking to buy right now .
who &apos;s talking about buying anything ? i am giving it away .
edie , we cannot have sex in here .
it &apos;s someone else &apos;s bed . that &apos;s wrong !
we can &apos;t use my place , we can &apos;t use yours .
i &apos;ll be damned if i am going to pay for a hotel room
when there are all of these empty houses all over town
that i have the keys to .
though reluctant at first , &lt; / i &gt;
carlos soon saw the wisdom in edie &apos;s plan . &lt; / i &gt;
secret affairs are a lot like real estate . &lt; / i &gt;
the three keys to success are ... &lt; / i &gt;
location ... &lt; / i &gt;
location ... &lt; / i &gt;
location . &lt; / i &gt;
get careful . i can &apos;t sit down that fast .
i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s gonna be worth it .
ok , so tell tom the secret of your risotto .
well , i saute spinach and onions in white wine .
no , no , the profit margin .
basically , it costs a dollar to make ...
and we charge 20 !
so , four people who would &apos;ve shared a $ 15 pizza
are now spending $ 80 .
ok , kids , dig in .
there &apos;s just one little problem with that , lynette .
yeah .
those families you &apos;re talking about have kids .
and no kid is gonna eat anything with spinach in it .
tom ?
it &apos;s delicious , huh ?
yeah .
yeah ? rick learned how to make this in italy .
go ahead . try it . i want to see what you think .
it &apos;s good .
it &apos;s awesome .
it &apos;s good .
but ?
but it &apos;s just not us .
&quot; us &quot; ? what is &quot; us &quot; ?
look , we &apos;re a neighborhood pizza place . we serve pizza .
i like this better . i &apos;m bored of pizza .
porter , the adults are talking .
look , we serve good food at good prices .
we &apos;re not looking to be the next ,
you know , trendy flash @-@ in @-@ the @-@ pan .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m looking for , either .
my food , it &apos;s not trendy , it &apos;s classic .
rick ... obviously , you &apos;re a great cook .
when you have your own place , i will definitely eat there .
but i see no reason to change my menu .
more , please .
hi . can i help you ?
yeah . i &apos;m here to see mr. lang .
he &apos;s not here . is that for him ?
yeah , but it &apos;s very personal .
ok .
i don &apos;t think i should leave it with the maid .
do i look like the maid ? give me that !
不要报警 我会联系你的
you ! blackmailer !
oh , man . you weren &apos;t supposed to look .
get off me !
fifty thousand dollars ? are you insane ?
that &apos;s not for you to decide .
i want all negatives of the photo
or i start breaking fingers !
you can &apos;t break my fingers . come on !
give me the pictures !
hey , break it up .
break it up . come on . come on .
she &apos;s crazy ! she &apos;s crazy !
that &apos;s for calling me a maid !
he works the hotel security monitors .
that &apos;s how he got the photos .
that miserable cockroach .
if you want to smack him around a little ,
i can go inside and turn up the radio .
again , no thank you . but i will need those photos .
oh , no no . i &apos;m going to hang onto these .
they &apos;re a little revealing .
ma &apos;am , we can &apos;t charge him without evidence .
if he walks , he can do what he wants with the originals .
ok . yeah .
but guard them with your life .
yeah . especially that one .
we &apos;ve been open for three months now
and we barely turned a profit !
we are building a customer base . that takes time .
go on , ask her .
no , you ask her .
why are you being so stubborn ?
you would rather see the restaurant fail
than succeed with rick &apos;s idea .
and i can &apos;t believe that
you two are ready to toss out my concept .
you know why not just re @-@ name the restaurant
lynette and rick &apos;s .
can we have fudgsicles ?
no !
sorry , lynette , but the menu is not changing .
end of discussion .
i don &apos;t think so . i &apos;m giving it a try .
that &apos;s not your decision to make .
yeah ?
then come down to the restaurant and stop me .
oh , that &apos;s right . you can &apos;t .
i told you she &apos;d say no .
mrs. mccluskey always has some fudgsicles .
yeah , but she &apos;s in the hospital .
where &apos;s the ice cream ?
she didn &apos;t have any .
aw , man !
there wasn &apos;t anything good in there ?
no .
what the hell were you thinking ?
how was i supposed to know
the cops were going to release the photos to the press ?
everybody in town knows
the police chief is the mayor &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law , everyone !
enough , john ! i want you to organize a press conference
and you know what , help me prep for it .
this is going to be a bloodbath .
i don &apos;t know how are you gonna prep ?
just get me a bucket of piranhas , i &apos;ll stick my head in it .
you &apos;re a single guy . maybe people won &apos;t care .
i &apos;m running a family values campaign
and i had sex in an elevator .
i think they will care .
look , i know this is my fault ,
so if you want to bite my head off , go ahead .
you know , gaby ,
there are only two things that matter to me these days .
my campaign and you .
and if i had to lose one of them .
i &apos;d rather it was the campaign .
is there anything i can do ?
yeah , you can stick around on election night .
i have a feeling i &apos;m going to need some serious consoling .
god , that is so good .
i know . it &apos;s hard to decide , huh ?
no . no . i &apos;m going to go
with the crab cakes and the little quesadillas .
well , all we need is a wedding cake , and we &apos;re done .
you are the most decisive bride i &apos;ve ever met .
i just guess i &apos;m in a rush .
gotcha . well , don &apos;t worry , you are not showing at all .
oh , no , no . no , i &apos;m not pregnant .
no , i just know what i want , which is ian .
so i &apos;m just eager to , you know , not get it over with , per se ,
but just to get to the good part .
which is the marriage to ian .
he seems like a great guy . i don &apos;t suppose he has a brother ?
so you &apos;re not seeing anyone ?
no . i &apos;m between disappointments .
well , are you free for dinner tomorrow ?
is this some lame setup ? please say yes .
well , there &apos;s this guy coming to dinner and he &apos;s single ,
and handsome , and charming , and ...
you had me a guy .
so how do you know him ?
he &apos;s just a neighbor .
hi , buddy , what are you doing ?
nothing .
you seem a little mopey lately . is everything ok ?
yeah . can we go see mrs. mccluskey ?
you guys didn &apos;t have to come down here .
no matter what that cat scan says ,
i &apos;m breaking out tomorrow .
parker really wanted to come visit you .
i &apos;m going to put water in these .
don &apos;t tell your brothers , but you were always my favorite .
i saw the man in your freezer .
lynette !
yeah ?
could you run down and get me some green jell @-@ o ?
oh , sure .
ok . time for a little grown @-@ up talk .
so can you understand now why i had to do what i did ?
you can never tell anyone , not even your mom .
hey , they didn &apos;t have jell @-@ o , so i hope pudding is ok ?
you know , let &apos;s give it to parker .
a good boy like him deserves a treat .
what are you thinking about ?
just ...
... this room really doesn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s too sterile .
could we go back to that spanish colonial on third ?
sure . fine .
you know what i was thinking ?
i &apos;m really happy .
and i haven &apos;t felt this happy in a long time .
how about you ? are you happy ?
oh , my god .
oops , sorry , bed &apos;s not made .
russell !
why don &apos;t you go check out
the sub @-@ zero in the kitchen . it &apos;s to die .
well , i see you can &apos;t
close a sale without opening something else .
oh , please . i heard about
your open house on holly drive .
they &apos;re still disinfecting the jacuzzi !
slut .
bitch .
think he &apos;s gonna tell ?
he &apos;s a gay realtor .
he &apos;s speed @-@ dialing as we speak .
then go stop him !
what &apos;s the big deal ? who cares if people find out ?
i do .
why ?
are you embarrassed to be dating me ?
no .
if gaby finds out she &apos;s going to hit the ceiling .
oh , why would she care ? she &apos;s dating that victor guy .
please , that &apos;s not gonna last .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re still in love with her .
no . i just ...
i mean , we &apos;ve been getting along , and i don &apos;t want to ...
i don &apos;t know who the bigger moron is , you or me .
hey , don &apos;t be like this .
look , we &apos;re having fun , right ?
apparently that &apos;s all we &apos;re having .
edie , come on .
no . fun &apos;s over .
ah , mike . thanks for coming .
thanks for asking me .
susan .
mike , i want you to meet maggie gilroy .
i don &apos;t believe this . you &apos;re setting me up ?
you need to move on , ok ?
i don &apos;t want to move on .
i came here to see you .
look , i &apos;m not available .
so if you feel like kissing someone tonight ,
point those lips at maggie .
here we go . your beer .
did i mention maggie is an amazing chef ?
we &apos;re embarrassed to be cooking for her .
stop . so mike , do you have a favorite type of cuisine ?
no . after three months of prison food ,
everything tastes good to me .
so you were in prison ?
he was totally innocent .
yeah , a woman was bludgeoned
to death and her blood wound up on my wrench .
oh , my god .
but he was cleared ! all charges dropped !
here . eat this .
that &apos;s just so awful .
to go to jail for a crime you didn &apos;t commit .
it was just a few months .
now , my first stretch for manslaughter , that was brutal .
my worst cellmate was this guy called stilts .
when they arrested him , they found a bowl full of ears .
i think that was meant for you .
sorry .
so why don &apos;t i just go and brew some coffee ?
and i brought a little surprise for dessert .
wedding cakes for you to sample .
great .
thanks a lot . now maggie thinks you &apos;re charles manson .
i don &apos;t care . i love you .
don &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s true .
i remember everything now .
when i got run over , i was on my way to propose to you .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
i do .
what would you have said ?
you know what i would have said . it doesn &apos;t matter .
the hell it doesn &apos;t , susan .
if you can look me in the eye
and tell me that when we kissed you felt nothing ,
then i &apos;ll just go .
but only if you can say that and really mean it .
can you ?
who wants wedding cake ?
maggie , these cakes are fantastic .
great .
all you have to do is choose one and we &apos;re done .
did you notice the themes ?
themes ?
yes . this one is very british .
fondant icing and toffee ganache .
and this is your classic american .
white cake with butter cream frosting .
so which one do you like the best ?
wow , it &apos;s kind of hard to decide .
well , that depends on what you &apos;re looking for .
rich and elegant ...
... or down to earth and sweet ?
i don &apos;t know .
you want to taste them again ?
no . i know what they taste like . i &apos;m just torn , ok ?
there &apos;s no need to get upset . it &apos;s just a cake .
it is not just a cake ! it &apos;s a major decision !
hey , if you like them both so much .
why don &apos;t you have two cakes ?
how would that look ?
&quot; oh , hey everybody , here &apos;s my wedding cake ! &quot;
&quot; oh , and what &apos;s that over there ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s my other wedding cake ! &quot;
i have to pick ! and i will !
so just stop pressuring me , ok ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i think i was just having a little sugar rush .
thanks again . and sorry .
seriously , just put it off . just a month or two .
excuse me , am i interrupting something ?
no . it &apos;s nothing .
i think it &apos;s time to level with him .
i just told susan i want her back .
excuse me ?
i know it puts a crimp in your plans .
i &apos;m sorry . but i love her .
that &apos;s too damn bad . she doesn &apos;t love you .
really ? she didn &apos;t seem to mind when i kissed her .
what ? did he just kiss you ?
no . it was days ago .
and you let him ?
no . he pounced .
it was hardly a pounce .
you bastard ! we had an agreement !
susan doesn &apos;t have to marry
you because you won her in a game of cards .
oh , he didn &apos;t tell you how we played poker for you ?
you bet me in a game of poker ?
it &apos;s not how it sounds .
i merely suggested that if i
won the hand then he would stop badgering you .
and if he won ?
well , i forget the exact terms .
the point is , he lost as i knew he would .
i would never have wagered you
if i didn &apos;t have a very good hand .
get out .
susan , please .
you heard her .
you too !
i &apos;ve had it with both of you .
you tug at me like i &apos;m some kind of wishbone .
you &apos;re just upset .
no , i am beyond upset .
you two want a decision ? here &apos;s what i decide .
there will be no kissing and there will be no wedding .
and there will be no damn cake !
what &apos;s this ?
pumpkin sage ravioli .
it &apos;s a little thank you for taking a chance on me .
are you kidding ? i should be thanking you .
we took in three grand tonight .
oh , wow . candles too .
yeah , i think we should use them all the time .
it softens up the ambiance .
so , come on , eat .
oh , my god .
if we serve this for tomorrow &apos;s special ,
we will clear four grand .
great . just be sure to run it by tom .
why ? you know he &apos;ll just shoot it down .
i mean , i get it , he &apos;s in pain , he doesn &apos;t like being sidelined ,
but that is no reason to ...
you know , let &apos;s talk about something else .
yeah , sure .
unless you &apos;d like to go ? you &apos;re here so late all the time .
no . no , i like being here .
it beats going home to an empty apartment .
no friends to hang out with ?
my friends come in two varieties .
ones i drove away before i got clean ,
and the ones i should avoid if i want to stay clean .
yeah , i gotcha .
you ever wear your hair down ?
what ? yeah .
sometimes . why ?
it looks really good .
you should do it more often .
oh , well ... thanks .
this is delicious .
thanks . do you want some more wine ?
sure .
daddy !
the paper has a story about your restaurant !
you &apos;re kidding ! come here . what does it say ?
&quot; when scavo &apos;s pizzeria opened its doors , &quot;
&quot; you could almost hear the city groan , &quot;
&quot; &apos; just what we need , another pizza joint . &apos; &quot;
&quot; but with an updated menu from new chef rick colletti ... &quot;
is he the man who cooked us that really really ...
yeah . yep , that &apos;s the one . what else does it say , honey ?
&quot; there &apos;s more than just crayons on the table . &quot;
&quot; the veal piccata is divine &quot;
and the mushroom risotto is an ... e @-@ x @-@ q @-@ u ... &quot;
exquisite .
... &quot; an exquisite treat . &quot;
&quot; scavo &apos;s has been transformed &quot;
&quot; from a mundane family eatery &quot;
&quot; into the area &apos;s hottest ... &quot;
that &apos;s enough , kaylar .
daddy &apos;s tired .
ok .
ok , ok , ok ! ok , i know you guys like a good scandal .
but i think the citizens of
fairview are more interested in the real issues .
mr. lang , given your 15 point drop in the polls ,
what do you say to your constituents ?
well , i would ask them
to not base their view of me on a single ...
it &apos;s not going very well , is it ?
picked up on that , did you ?
who is she , mr. lang ? give us a name .
no , i will not identify the woman .
what are you hiding ? is she a prostitute ?
no , she &apos;s not a prostitute .
i &apos;ll answer your questions one at a time .
that does it .
wait , what are you doing ? gabby , stop please .
excuse me . excuse me . excuse me !
could you please ...
excuse me ! i am the woman in the photos .
may i have your name ?
what are you doing ?
standing by my man .
my name is gabrielle marquez ,
and i want you to know right before those photos were taken ,
victor asked me to marry him .
what did you say ?
i said , &quot; yes , i would be thrilled to be mrs. victor lang . &quot;
what are your family values ?
lang , are you going to get married ?
have you set a date ?
are you really getting married ?
in fact , i was so overcome that ,
when we were trapped in that elevator ,
i seized the moment to express my joy .
so this is a love story ?
the only reason victor kept it from you was to protect me .
because he &apos;s the kind of
man who puts a woman &apos;s honor before his own .
and that &apos;s the kind of man you marry .
that &apos;s the kind of man you vote for .
what &apos;s that smell ?
ma &apos;am .
are you karen mccluskey ?
that little bastard gave me up , didn &apos;t he ?
today , at the mayoral candidate &apos;s press conference ,
a woman identified as gabrielle marquez , a former model ,
surprised reporter by announce her engagement to mr. lang .
the only reason he didn &apos;t tell you
was because he was protecting me .
carlos , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard ...
yeah , i heard .
in a few months , i will be mrs. victor lang .
i heard on the radio
the power company is still having problems .
there might be another rolling blackout today .
do you want me to leave ida &apos;s number
in case of something happens ?
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll be fine .
did you read our review in the paper ?
yep .
ok . i &apos;m off .
power . &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;s the type of thing most people don &apos;t think about ... &lt; / i &gt;
... until it &apos;s taken away . &lt; / i &gt;
whether it &apos;s the political power of the many ... &lt; / i &gt;
... or a lover &apos;s influence over just one . &lt; / i &gt;
we all want some sort of power in our lives . &lt; / i &gt;
if only to give ourselves choices . &lt; / i &gt;
yes , to be without choices , &lt; / i &gt;
to feel utterly powerless ... &lt; / i &gt;
well , it &apos;s a lot ... &lt; / i &gt;
... like being alone in the dark . &lt; / i &gt;
