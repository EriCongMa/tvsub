10 years ago randy slade
entered north valley high school with a gun and a bomb .
this weekend , the school will try to memorialize
those 13 students that were slain at slade &apos;s hands .
the events will culminate with a candlelight vigil
in memory of the north valley high massacre .
principal doug givens will read a--
please ...
please don &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t do this .
can you look me in the eye ?
good @-@ bye , principal givens .
don &apos;t leave me .
you can &apos;t leave me !
what--
no .
no !
here are jack &apos;s standardized test scores .
jack tells me you read together
every night you &apos;re home .
we just finished
&quot; charlie and the chocolate factory &quot; last night .
i wish you could work with all of my kids .
so he &apos;s reading at a fourth @-@ grade level .
mm @-@ hmm . as you can see ,
his scores are high across the board .
but he seems to be holding back in the classroom .
why do you think that is ?
has he ever mentioned a classmate named paul ?
mm @-@ hmm . paul cain ?
yes , he &apos;s been over . he &apos;s a friend of jack &apos;s .
well , paul is being mean to jack for some reason .
how long has that been going on ?
a few weeks .
jack &apos;s just his latest target .
we &apos;ve moved jack away from paul ,
and we &apos;re documenting everything , of course .
well , jack says that things are going very well at school ,
so the steps you &apos;re taking must be working .
thank you .
let me know if anything changes .
absolutely .
can i keep this ?
sure .
thank you so much .
does anyone remember this picture ?
hotch and i were there .
that &apos;s principal doug givens .
we had to drag him to safety .
high school bombing in boise , right ?
school shooter and school bomber .
a kid named randy slade shot 3 students
and then set off an i.e.d. in the cafeteria via cell phone ,
killing himself and 13 kids total ,
but not before posting all of his plans online .
it was one of those &quot; where were you ? &quot; events .
my whole campus was glued to the tv .
last night , principal givens was killed by a bomb
modeled exactly like the old one .
it feels like the unsub wants to attack the man
who kept the school together after the bombing .
it &apos;s a pretty symbolic target .
and this week is the 10th anniversary of the massacre .
and today is the first day of a 4 @-@ day event
to commemorate the bombing at the school .
except commemorating it isn &apos;t enough for this unsub .
no . he wants to relive it .
&quot; you may leave school , but it never leaves you . &quot;
andy partridge .
perpetrators of school violence
are often sophisticated with their weapons .
randy slade carried his bomb in his backpack .
this guy hid his in givens &apos; clock radio .
yeah , and progressive .
each one tries to top the body count of the one previous .
and they &apos;re loners by default , not by choice .
they try to join various social groups , but they get shut out .
randy slade wasn &apos;t a loner at all .
the family cooperated fully with us .
he was a high @-@ functioning psychopath ,
straight @-@ a student , varsity wrestler ,
lots of girlfriends .
with an above @-@ average
intelligence that made him incredibly resourceful .
his explosive of choice was semtex .
it &apos;s found at demolition sites , but it &apos;s held under lock and key .
which made us consider the possibility of a partner .
never found one .
slade was too much of a narcissist to share credit .
but he was also an impulsive teen ,
which is what bothers me about this unsub .
his sense of control ?
and the end game that he &apos;s working toward .
slade &apos;s pathology revolved around the big kill .
this unsub could have done the same
if he &apos;d waited for the candlelight vigil ,
which means there &apos;s no blaze of glory fantasy here .
this unsub has more bombs made ,
and he &apos;s savoring the anticipation of his next attack .
boise police department .
agent hotchner .
chief .
dave .
sorry to meet again under these circumstances .
took your advice and shut down the school .
was gonna cancel the memorial , too ,
but some of the alums
said they &apos;d go through with it anyway .
did you get the student files to our technical analyst ?
good . we &apos;ll start with criminal records .
what &apos;d you find , garcia ?
a blast from your past , i believe .
does the name brandon slade ring a bell ?
yeah , the bomber &apos;s younger brother .
sweet kid .
he couldn &apos;t give us much back then .
most 7 @-@ year @-@ olds don &apos;t .
they do , however , grow up to become seniors
who attend the same high school .
thanks , garcia .
i thought the slades we &apos;re gonna leave boise .
they tried , but the network interviews
made them nationwide pariahs .
did you question brandon about last night ?
he said he was watching pirated movies .
his mom backs him up .
so does his laptop .
we &apos;ll need to talk to him .
ok .
so the unsub has to be
tied to the school somehow , right ?
current student , alumni ,
family member who lost someone ?
it could be slade groupie celebrating his hero .
he taped nails to the exterior of the bomb ,
specifically to rip open flesh .
that &apos;s a sadistic detail of slade &apos;s the unsub copied .
except he tricked givens into blowing himself up .
a groupie probably wouldn &apos;t show
that much self @-@ control .
but someone with an ax to grind against the principal would .
maybe he &apos;s a surrogate for the tormenters in high school
he can &apos;t punish .
who were yours ?
i don &apos;t even remember .
you don &apos;t even remember ?
wait , were you one of the mean girls ?
no .
valedictorian , soccer scholarship ,
corn @-@ fed , but still a size zero .
i think that you might have been a mean girl .
i was actually one of the nice girls ,
even to guys like you .
guys like me ? i &apos;ll have you know that my social standing
increased once i started winning at basketball .
oh , yeah , you played basketball ?
i didn &apos;t play . i coached basketball .
i broke down the opposing team &apos;s shooting strategy .
is that why morgan kicked you out of the pool last week ?
yeah . it took him 3 rounds to realize i was hustling him .
well , it looks like we &apos;re
not the only ones interested in brandon .
it &apos;s gonna make it a lot harder for us to talk our way in .
unless we use it to our advantage .
good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
i &apos;m ssa david rossi of the fbi .
that &apos;s r @-@ o @-@ s @-@ s @-@ i.
so if anyone has any questions , you &apos;re free to ask them now .
does this have anything to do with brandon slade ?
mrs. slade ?
i &apos;m special agent emily prentiss with the fbi . this is--
go through my lawyer .
martha , we can do that . we &apos;ll just have to come back later .
agent hotchner .
how are you ?
what do you want ?
to catch the man who killed principal givens .
well , then go catch him . but it wasn &apos;t my son .
let us prove that for you .
once we rule him out , we can get these people off your lawn .
martha , you can observe . you can stop us and call
your lawyer whenever you want .
agent rossi was always very nice to brandon .
let him do it .
it &apos;s unlikely ...
dave .
all right , feel free to call me
if you have any other background questions .
my phone number is 702 @-@ 555 @-@ 0103 .
and what &apos;s your name , sir ?
it &apos;s dr. spencer reid . r @-@ e @-@ i @-@ d .
you know , there &apos;s a sniper right be--ooh !
never mind .
when did you become a gamer , old man ?
oh , a while back . after this kid told me
how much he loved playing with his big brother .
will you sign this for me ?
first edition . i &apos;m touched .
you &apos;re a good writer .
so are you .
i read one of your ap english essays .
&quot; the futility of jay gatsby and the green light . &quot;
where &apos;d you get that ?
well , i was curious as to , uh ,
what kind of kid you grew up to be .
apparently a smart one .
but that didn &apos;t stop you
from getting beaten up on a regular basis .
you know how it is with fans .
i mean , you bang yours , mine kick my ass .
and , uh , principal givens , he couldn &apos;t stop that , could he ?
that must have really ticked you off .
listen , i already told the police , ok ,
i was watching movies on my computer .
well , just because you downloaded them
doesn &apos;t mean you sat here and watched them .
you were cool 10 years ago .
so were you .
when did harry leave ?
about 5 years ago .
he got his fresh start ,
and i got the underwater mortgage .
is that why brandon ended up in north valley ?
i did my best .
but i know my son .
he wouldn &apos;t have done this .
just want to see if you took after your big brother .
you know what , dude ? i did it , all right ?
so go ahead , cuff me .
actually , dude , i don &apos;t think
you &apos;re mean enough to have done it .
but tell me the truth .
you &apos;re happy that principal givens is dead , aren &apos;t you ?
yes , i &apos;m happy . it &apos;s what randy wanted .
well , randy wanted the whole school dead .
yeah .
right .
whoa . am i missing something here , brandon ?
no , you got it all figured out .
well , did randy have some sort of agenda ?
did he target specific people inside of the school ?
everybody knew who he wanted to take out .
we didn &apos;t . we couldn &apos;t find any logic to his actions .
so how do you know ? huh ?
did he tell you ?
did a 17 @-@ year @-@ old confide in a 7 @-@ year @-@ old ?
did you find something ?
he had a list , didn &apos;t he ?
i want my lawyer .
if he still has the list , it &apos;s somewhere in that room .
martha , do you know anything about this ?
i can have a search warrant in an hour .
no .
mom--
tear it apart .
no--no , mom , please !
louie , oh , my god .
chelsea .
get in here .
i thought this was too lame for you .
no , are you kidding ? i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
i heard about principal givens when my flight landed .
how you holding up ?
better , now that i &apos;m on the next flight out of here .
are you kidding ? you can &apos;t leave .
i already survived one psychopath .
i &apos;m not about to stare down another .
yeah , but people need you right now .
you need to show them that
we &apos;re not afraid of guys like randy slade .
yeah , well , i am afraid of guys like randy slade .
and i &apos;m sick of hearing what people want .
people who weren &apos;t in the cafeteria .
people like you .
just ...
please , go .
ok ?
lewis , you &apos;re not gonna change my mind .
yeah , bookshelf is clean .
i love dating readers , hate profiling them .
&quot; catcher in the rye , &quot; &quot; atlas shrugged . &quot;
these are all titles that a teenage kid would obsess over ,
but randy made that list when brandon was just a kid .
you &apos;re right .
so , however brandon got his hands on that list ,
he would have hid it in something a 7 @-@ year @-@ old would read .
hotch ! we found it .
principal givens is on this list .
you &apos;re on speaker , jj .
so we might have another one .
might ?
one of the north valley alumni was killed in her motel room .
no bomb or gun this time . looks like he used his bare hands .
you got a name ?
chelsea grant .
she &apos;s on the list .
the unsub crushed chelsea &apos;s throat
so she couldn &apos;t scream , then he pulverized her ribs ,
sending fragments of bone into her heart .
principal givens was high @-@ profile . chelsea wasn &apos;t .
right now the only thing
connecting them is they &apos;re both on the kill list .
a list that brandon kept secret for 10 years .
but he was in custody when this happened .
the question is , how did the unsub
get the exact same list ?
we ruled out a partner , but not conclusively .
slade made every part of his plan public .
it doesn &apos;t make sense that he would hide a partner .
he didn &apos;t want to share the credit .
and this weekend is the partner &apos;s best chance to claim it .
partners of dominant psychopaths are usually submissive ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that they can &apos;t be intelligent
or that they &apos;re physically weak .
this unsub laid low after the bombing
and successfully evaded police and fbi .
that took cunning and patience ,
which he &apos;s exhibiting now with his current murders .
we think he fits the loner profile slade debunked .
he grew up in an abusive home ,
which kept him from forming
the normal social bonds in high school .
we interviewed all the outcasts from back then .
how did this guy slip through ?
even outcasts eventually form friendships .
but this unsub was the outcast the outcasts rejected .
he won &apos;t stand out in any capacity ,
and as a matter of fact , most of his fellow students
probably won &apos;t even remember graduating with him .
and that invisibility is what made him attractive to slade .
this partner wouldn &apos;t steal the spotlight .
slade turned to the cafeteria
because most of the names on his list
ate there together during fifth period .
so his hatred festered when the names on the list
emerged from the cafeteria as media heroes .
and now he wants to finish the job that randy started .
emotionally , this weekend is
more a high school reunion to him than a memorial .
we go to reunions to show who we grew up to be .
often that means changing everything about who we were .
consciously or not , randy slade revealed clues
as to his partner &apos;s identity when he detonated his bomb .
agent prentiss will be conducting cognitive interviews
to see what the survivors might remember .
you want us to walk through what happened that day ?
didn &apos;t we do that when we were seniors ?
yes , but there may be some details that
you didn &apos;t think were
important at the time that could help us now ,
things that could help us learn about the partner .
randy made us all lie face @-@ down .
i didn &apos;t see anything .
none of us did .
well , that &apos;s not true .
jerry did . he &apos;s the guy randy made lock the doors .
yeah . yeah , i did .
the interviews we &apos;re going to conduct
won &apos;t focus on what you saw , but what you felt .
you want me to tell you how i felt
licking the tile in the cafeteria ?
thanks , i do that at therapy twice a week .
how about how i feel now ,
seeing my name on a list of people who should be dead ?
the boise police have offered everyone on this list
a protective detail .
like that would have done chelsea any good .
she was killed in her hotel room .
jerry &apos;s not on the list .
let him help you . i &apos;m out .
ever get volunteered for a job you don &apos;t want ?
so , as you can see from your board there ,
this kill list is weirdly similar to high school .
group one is like the popular kids--
prom court , football team , dean &apos;s list .
the heathers , if you will .
kids in slade &apos;s social circle .
what about number two ?
uh , mm @-@ hmm , that would be the kids
from the other side of the tracks ,
180 @-@ degree difference , kids this close to getting kicked out--
stoners , burnouts , mental cases .
chelsea grant is on this list .
maybe slade targeted them because they disgusted him ?
but they didn &apos;t threaten slade &apos;s sense of superiority .
he wouldn &apos;t have even cared about them .
all right , well , maybe the partner put them on the list .
they &apos;d be closer to his social status than slade &apos;s .
why would the--
i &apos;m so sorry .
why would the unsub list kids that he fit in with ?
apparently that &apos;s how this clique worked .
the kids in it were meaner
to each other than kids on the outside .
garcia , separate out all the kids who got into trouble regularly .
then eliminate the names that the partner put on the list .
now , who &apos;s left that came to the memorial ?
right . whoever made the list wouldn &apos;t put their name on it .
sir , i think--
i think i &apos;ve got him .
lewis ramsey .
fbi .
put the drink down . you &apos;re coming with us .
thanks for doing this .
so , i have some crime scene photos from the day
if you &apos;d like to take a look .
i don &apos;t need them .
ok .
it was 12 : 50 .
lunch had just started .
it was thursday .
when did you first notice randy ?
he came in talking on his cell .
did you hear the conversation ?
he was talking to his mom .
but that &apos;s not what i noticed first .
what did you notice ?
the gun in his hand .
natalie gallo , she was the first .
she never even saw it .
someone asked him what he was doing and he ...
what are you doing ?
turned and shot him in the chest .
so , uh ... nobody said anything after that .
that was when he ordered you to lock the doors , right ?
jerry , let &apos;s go . lock the doors .
and then he started playing the game .
yeah .
randy went table to table .
he was ranting .
what did he say ?
i am god .
now , who &apos;s brave enough to look god in the eye ?
how about you , brad ?
can you look me in the eye ?
when kids didn &apos;t , he shot them .
no ?
allison .
protect us in our hour ...
allison , stop praying .
never mind .
he walked up next to me .
how about you ?
we were never close , but ...
we were always cool .
i don &apos;t know what made me think i could do it .
but i did .
i looked him in the eye .
you &apos;re not even worth a bullet .
he walked to his backpack ...
pulled out the bomb ...
and he walked right over there ...
he said ...
i ... am ... god !
and like that , 10 kids were gone .
those reporters always asked me about that .
why did he detonate so early ?
i still don &apos;t know .
now , let &apos;s go back for a second .
randy was pointing the gun at you .
did you see the cell phone in his hand ?
yeah .
what was on it ?
i--i don &apos;t know .
it was the detonator .
all i saw was the black casing .
the black cell phone ?
are you sure ?
yeah . why ?
the gray cell phone was the detonator .
the black cell was the one he &apos;d talked to his mother on .
uh , that &apos;s what i meant ,
the--the gray one .
it &apos;s just a mistake . sorry .
i &apos;m telling you , i didn &apos;t kill her .
then how do you explain your fingerprints in her room ?
ok , i saw her last night , but i wouldn &apos;t ...
she &apos;s my friend .
you &apos;re very convincing , lewis .
but you were convincing 10 years ago , too .
so what was your excuse for not being in the cafeteria ?
oh , yeah . you were blazing up in the back parking lot , right ?
that wasn &apos;t an excuse . it was the truth .
yeah , of course it was .
it also allowed you to pose as a loser .
the very type you wanted to kill .
you know how we know ?
you wrote it down .
&quot; all the losers in this godforsaken school . &quot;
i didn &apos;t write that one .
but you did type up the rest of the list .
yes .
lewis , we know how guys like randy make friends .
they build up rapport through secrecy .
only the two of you are smart enough
to see through the bs of high school , right ?
and it felt so good doing whatever randy said
and not have to tell anybody about it .
make me a list of kids we should kill .
sure , randy .
get me a pound of semtex
from your dad &apos;s construction site .
whatever you say , randy .
but i never thought that he would--
he would use you ?
you were mad that he actually did it .
but you were also mad that he left you behind .
that &apos;s not true .
then why come back ?
what does a loser like you
have to gain by seeing all the kids that he hated so much ?
i came this close to flushing two years of sobriety
down the toilet tonight .
not just because chelsea died ,
but because i knew that they were gonna cancel that ceremony .
see , tomorrow night
i was gonna tell people what i did .
and i knew that i would be arrested
as an accomplice .
i knew it , but ...
i had to .
this is my final amends .
you buy it ?
he fits the profile , and the evidence points to him ,
but he seems sincere .
he &apos;s not the unsub . he was the partner ,
but look at how slade added
&quot; all the losers in this godforsaken school . &quot;
this capitalization isn &apos;t an accident . look .
l @-@ s @-@ r--
lewis stuart ramsey .
so slade named his own partner .
ironically , lewis &apos; marijuana conviction saved his life .
well , that puts us back to our original problem .
if the unsub isn &apos;t the partner ,
how did he get his hands on a list
that slade and lewis kept to themselves ?
the only answer is that part of the profile is wrong .
the unsub &apos;s vendetta has nothing to do with the list .
did you get anything from jerry holtz ?
only that he mixed up the cell phones that slade used .
it felt like he was making the story up ,
but i only had a hunch .
we need to find him now . there &apos;s a connection to the victimology
that we &apos;re missing . whatever he &apos;s holding back might be the key .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
can you look me in the eye , jerry ?
look at me !
look at me ! look at me !
look at me !
i didn &apos;t know !
i didn &apos;t know .
that &apos;s the point .
they &apos;re gonna find out .
jerry holtz ?
how long ?
less than an hour .
security guard heard the commotion ,
but the unsub was already gone .
the only people who knew we were doing the cognitive interviews
were the other survivors . the unsub must be part of that group .
well , we don &apos;t know that for a fact .
he could have been lying in wait .
look , hotch wants me to go through the victims &apos; lives
and find the overlap .
we can compare their histories with the unsub &apos;s .
well , what else do we have to go on ?
spence said the unsub would have broken his hand
beating chelsea to death . did you notice anyone
with a cast on their hand , someone who seemed hurt ?
no .
i might know why .
this unsub doesn &apos;t feel pain .
there &apos;s a medical condition called pain asymbolia ,
where patients register harmful stimuli
without being bothered by it . they &apos;ve been documented
holding their hand over an open flame
because their brain
doesn &apos;t send pain signals to the central nervous system .
sounds pretty rare . you sure the unsub has it ?
the crime scenes prove it .
this unsub displayed an unusual level
of savagery towards his victims .
and consider this--
he smashed through a glass display case ,
but there were not cuts on jerry .
that means he most likely punched through it as a show of force .
now , the only way the human body could withstand that level of pain
is if he couldn &apos;t feel it at all .
it must take a major toll on someone &apos;s emotional development .
a significant contributor to our sense of empathy
is the way we personally experience pain .
and the unsub didn &apos;t develop his sense of empathy
because it was cut off .
does every person with asymbolia have this ?
actually , most feel empathy just fine ,
which makes me think the rest of our profile is still accurate .
loner , invisible ,
outcast , boiling rage--
son of a bitch !
hi ! this is dr. spencer reid . i actually can come to the phone
right now with a very special message that your mother is--
reid .
sorry . i &apos;m really sorry .
i don &apos;t know what got into me . where were we ?
i &apos;m going to have garcia check medical records .
what causes asymbolia ?
s @-@ s @-@ severe trauma produces lesions in the insular cortex ,
usually after a stroke . but this unsub &apos;s so young ,
it &apos;s most likely caused by an external factor .
like a bomb going off next to him ?
yeah , a bomb going off next to him .
i will crush you .
what ?
what ?
it &apos;s so weird seeing yearbooks again .
a friend of mine who teaches said that facebook
is making them obsolete .
i &apos;m having serious flashbacks going through these senior bios .
four years of accomplishments boiled down to one paragraph .
hey , did your school have anything called &quot; top 10 &quot; ?
mm , no . is it an academic thing ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
only 10 of the survivors listed it ,
including jerry and chelsea ,
and neither one of them were valedictorian material .
ok , so ... what are we looking at here ?
well , maybe it &apos;s a clique inside a clique .
yeah , but it &apos;s jocks , nerds , theater geeks .
nothing that would bring these kids together .
except ...
what ?
i know what the top 10 is .
hey , tiffany .
where you going ?
uh , there &apos;s gonna be a get @-@ together
for the survivors .
didn &apos;t you hear ? they canceled the vigil .
i know .
that &apos;s why some of us are getting together
at the seven stars restaurant later .
great . i &apos;ll join you .
i would love that ,
but it &apos;s kind of a top 10 thing .
well , top 8 now .
you understand , right ?
totally .
tell everyone i say hi .
ok .
recognize the top 10 ?
no .
they were the students
that went in front of the cameras after the bombing .
i thought all the surviving students were interviewed .
after the initial aftermath , yes ,
but these are the kids that went on talk shows ,
traveled to other schools .
my guess is that they didn &apos;t self @-@ select who made the cut .
principal givens did .
that &apos;s why the unsub killed him first .
he was an outcast who wanted to fit in .
being a survivor should have been his golden ticket .
but he was excluded again , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s killing them .
yeah . the rules of high school never changed ,
not even after a tragedy .
go ahead , garcia .
hey , listen up .
i cross @-@ referenced student files with medical records .
now , there were 6 kids
that were knocked unconscious in that blast ,
but only one fits the outcast profile .
his name is robert adams ,
and he just used his credit card at a local restaurant ,
the address of which ... i just sent you right now .
i &apos;m on my way .
it was the most ridiculous thing i &apos;ve ever done in my life .
i didn &apos;t want to do it ,
but jerry said we can &apos;t-- well , we lost the bet .
it was just very uncomfortable for everybody .
oh , god .
you ok ?
is everybody ok ?
sit down !
don &apos;t move !
sit down !
hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
is it that hard
for you people
to tell the truth about me ?
to notice me ? !
like you .
do you even know my name ?
ralph ?
guess again .
he &apos;s holding hostages in the restaurant .
they &apos;re clearing the upper floors now .
we got this video feed from the security camera .
two entrances-- the front , the kitchen .
either way he can see us coming .
he &apos;s nowhere near the window , so there &apos;s no line of sight .
yeah , but why take them hostage at all ?
if this is a vendetta , why not kill them now ?
we profiled this would be like a reunion to him .
he wants people to recognize who he is .
i think i know what he wants to be recognized for .
get up . get up !
robert adams , we &apos;re with the fbi .
we just want to talk to you .
you better drop those guns if you just want to talk .
we know why you &apos;re doing this , bob .
it &apos;s pretty obvious , isn &apos;t it ?
before tonight , they didn &apos;t know my name !
but now ...
no one will forget it .
bob , you &apos;ll be in the news for a couple of days .
but no one will know the real story .
what story is that ?
tiffany ...
what did randy say to the kid who looked him in the eye ?
he ... he said jerry wasn &apos;t worth a bullet .
but he didn &apos;t say it to jerry , did he , bob ?
did he , bob ?
how about you ?
no .
he said it to me .
i was the only one brave enough to stare him down ,
but his bomb knocked me out ,
and when i woke up ,
there was jerry on the tv telling my story !
my story !
and nobody got to find out
that bob adams was a good kid .
a brave kid . the kind of kid you &apos;d want to hang out with .
we can give you back your story , bob ,
but you have to drop the gun .
isn &apos;t it funny when your dream comes true ...
it &apos;s never the way you want .
bob .
drop the gun .
morgan , he &apos;s heading to the south entrance .
copy . i got the back covered .
he &apos;s going in the boiler room .
i &apos;m on my way .
fbi . drop the weapon , bob .
prentiss , in here !
hotch !
we need medical in the boiler room .
hold your fire .
that ... didn &apos;t ... hurt !
&quot; pain is the breaking of the shell
that encloses your understanding . &quot;
kahlil gibran .
we interrupt your regularly scheduled
musical selection with an important announcement .
never wage a practical joke war against an m.i.t. graduate ,
because we have a history of going nuclear .
now sit back , relax , and enjoy the dulcet sounds
of me screaming in your ear .
ok , kid , that was cute .
but that &apos;s all you got ?
hey , baby gi--
all right , reid , it &apos;s on .
just know that paybacks are a bitch .
how &apos;s jack ?
i just had a feeling .
there &apos;s a kid that &apos;s being mean to him at school ,
and jack &apos;s solution is to
invite him over and make friends with him .
that is the sweetest
and saddest thing i &apos;ve heard .
how did you find out ?
his teacher told me .
jack didn &apos;t tell you ?
oh , that must be hard .
he wants to solve it himself .
and you want to let him .
but there &apos;s probably a part of you
that wishes you could step in .
well , there &apos;s a part of me that wants to protect him
from everything that could hurt him , but i know i can &apos;t .
no .
but you can show him that he doesn &apos;t have to face it alone .
how did you get by in paris ?
um , i , um ...
i played a lot of online scrabble ...
with some girl named cheeto breath .
at this time , we &apos;d like you to call out names of people
who were hurt or died ,
people you &apos;d like to remember .
jerry holtz .
jay o &apos;brien .
steve tossell .
tucker cranwell .
allison humwald .
janine bergen .
natalie gallo .
randy slade .
why are we doing this ?
we haven &apos;t talked to mom in a while ,
so i thought it would be a good idea if we did it again .
but i don &apos;t want to make you sad .
buddy , you &apos;re not making me sad .
it makes me happy ,
because it reminds me what a great job mom did with you .
so maybe if we got in the habit of doing this again ,
you know , mom could help us .
like with what ?
you know , if you have a bad day .
mrs. mckee said paul &apos;s been mean to you .
he hasn &apos;t been mean to me .
no ?
ok .
well , mom , look out for jack anyway .
dad , too .
oh , dad , too . of course .
good job .
ok . time to settle down .
good night , buddy .
love you , dad .
