we &apos;re almost ready for you , dr. reid .
just a few questions .
are you having one of your headaches right now ?
yeah , i am .
how long have you had it ?
not really that long .
i don &apos;t know .
can you be more specific ?
maybe 2 days .
and the lights hurt your eyes .
any hallucinations ?
no .
hey , you ok ?
yeah . why ?
you &apos;re never late .
have we started the briefing yet ?
just about to .
then i &apos;m not late .
oh . yeah .
attention , intrepid bau adventurers .
the land of bermuda shorts , white leisure suits ,
and sansabelt slacks requests your presence .
vegas ?
arizona .
palm springs .
please .
i was going to say miami , but point well made
about the dizzying number of locales
with unfortunate fashion tendencies .
here we go .
shells in the eyes and mouth .
you don &apos;t see that every day .
not even in miami .
3 victims , the last one found with a ...
a decapitated cat ?
all were found within a mile
of each other in a mostly latino neighborhood in miami
called allapattah .
eduardo guzman , homeless . he was shot to death 7 days ago .
yanira espinal , prostitute ,
bludgeoned to death 3 days ago .
and then victor cabrera , he was an unemployed janitor .
he was slashed with a machete yesterday ,
as was his cat .
you know , considering the homeless man lived in that alley ,
all of the victims essentially were killed in their homes .
this took some time .
in the open .
you know , cowrie shells
and ritual offerings are common to a number
of afro @-@ caribbean religions .
but the upside @-@ down cross looks like satanism .
the first two victims had fingers missing ,
but on this one , he took both hands .
all of this could have been religious ?
this could have specific religious meaning
or it could just be part of the unsub &apos;s signature .
either way , his timetable &apos;s accelerating .
we have a day , maybe 2 , before the miami p.d.
has another body on its hands .
&quot; no man chooses evil because it is evil .
he only mistakes it for happiness , the good he seeks . &quot;
mary wollstonecraft shelley .
the first victim was frail and an easy target ,
and yet the unsub shot him from behind and at a distance .
by the second victim , the unsub chose
not to use a gun anymore .
he got up close and personal .
4 days is a rapid increase in confidence .
by the third victim , he was comfortable enough
to use a machete .
but still from behind .
so he &apos;s not invested in watch his victims suffer .
which fits what the m.e. said
about the mutilations being postmortem .
so we &apos;re back around a religious ritual .
reid ?
anything helpful ?
yeah . yeah .
the afro @-@ caribbean syncretic religions began
with slaves , who mixed their traditional religions
with catholicism in order to camouflage them .
the elements in this altar ...
look to me like santeria .
it &apos;s a yoruban @-@ based religion
developed in cuba .
practitioners worship orishas , deities that roughly correspond
with catholic saints .
and what about the shells ?
let &apos;s see . this is ellegua ,
the deity of the crossroads ,
a trickster and the impartial enforcer of justice .
so , is the unsub sacrificing the victims to him ?
none of these religions openly call for human sacrifice ,
only animals .
we need to determine whether these killings
are part of an existing ritual .
or whether he &apos;s using religion
to cover his own psychopathology .
the last victim used to frequent a local community center .
it might be a good way to get some background .
good . take reid with you .
prentiss and i will go to the last crime scene .
dave and seaver , get set up with the p.d.
this the line ?
hmm ?
uh , for coffee . sorry .
oh , no . no , i &apos;m just thinking .
aren &apos;t you always ?
yeah .
hey , what &apos;s the weather like in miami right now ?
i don &apos;t know exactly , but my guess--75 and sunny .
hey , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you &apos;re not gonna give me a bunch of facts
about the area and the demographics ?
the allapattah neighborhood is named after
the native american word for alligator .
there you go . there &apos;s the kid i know .
all right , 5372 seminole street .
this can &apos;t be it .
excuse me , sir . do you know where the community center is ?
it &apos;s down there .
this is seminole alley .
reid , you all right ?
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
a lot better than that goat .
yeah , you got that right .
you see a lot of animal sacrifices , detective ?
roosters , goats , even possums , but , uh ,
a cat is new to me .
he turned the victim &apos;s crucifix upside down .
well , he brought the shells and the murder weapon with him .
he must have brought gloves , too .
the only fingerprints they found belonged to the victim .
older , organized .
yeah , except he left a footprint .
that &apos;s something only an inexperienced unsub would do .
it &apos;s almost as though he planned this whole thing very carefully ,
but then reality was nothing like his imagination .
that throws him off balance and he makes a mistake .
but he is getting used to it .
each kill is more precise and well @-@ executed .
the first killing , he had to saw to take the finger off .
he made sure he brought something sharp enough this time .
right . he knows what he needs to bring with him
and what &apos;s already here .
he &apos;s been here before .
there &apos;s no signs of forced entry .
the victim let him in .
these chalk designs on the floor--
they were made before the blood spatter ,
and they &apos;re not smudged at all .
and no sign of a struggle .
maybe the victim chose to be part of the ritual .
after the murder , the unsub turned the victim &apos;s body over .
his face was clean , so he wiped the blood off .
remorse ?
or he feels conflicted about harming the victims .
they may represent somebody to him .
these shells--
they look like &quot; see no evil , speak no evil . &quot;
he &apos;s symbolically silencing his victims
so they can &apos;t tell anyone about him .
by posing the bodies , he is sending a message .
he may not want the victims to see or hear him ,
but he wants somebody to .
victor was my best friend .
we were like brothers .
we &apos;re sorry for your loss , mr. mercado .
he was sick for a long time ,
but he was finally feeling better .
he was sick ?
his men &apos;s part , down there .
the cancer .
where was he being treated ?
no , no , no . no doctors .
they don &apos;t do nothing but make you worse .
throw radiation on you , poison you .
he did his cleaning every day .
that &apos;s why he was feeling better .
what do you mean by cleaning ?
he clean his head , his body .
but he got one of the saints mad .
maybe he forgot to feed ellegua .
tuti .
i must go .
excuse me .
you run this place ?
i don &apos;t talk to cops ,
unless you got a warrant .
well , one thing &apos;s for sure is this community
does not trust outsiders .
they barely trust insiders .
and none of the residents are gonna want to tell us
what &apos;s ritual and what isn &apos;t .
garcia ?
hey , garcia .
where you at ?
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m right-- i &apos;m right--i &apos;m right here .
i &apos;m always right here .
all right , listen , we need you to find us an expert
on afro @-@ caribbean religions , someone outside of the community
who might be willing to talk .
if he or she exists ,
yours truly will find him or her .
yes . thanks , garcia .
so not only do all the victims know the unsub ,
but they participate with him in a consensual ritual
before he kills them .
he poses the bodies after death .
he wants them to be found .
the question is , who is he trying to communicate with ?
and what &apos;s he trying to say ?
the professor has a morning class ,
but he &apos;ll be with you shortly .
thank you .
i &apos;ve never seen a first edition &quot; tractatus &quot; before .
yeah , hotch .
we got another one .
well , that didn &apos;t take long .
jimmy mercado , friend of the last victim .
jimmy mercado ?
wait a minute . reid , isn &apos;t jimmy mercado
the shaved ice man ?
yeah .
hotch , we just interviewed this guy yesterday .
all right , so anyone talking to us could be at risk .
we &apos;ll send photos .
mercado was killed ?
psychopathic hubris .
this unsub &apos;s success is making him feel invincible .
hi . sorry i &apos;m late .
the lady that called said you &apos;re investigating these murders
we &apos;ve been seeing on tv .
awful . just awful .
so , how can i be of assistance ?
we were hoping you could help us analyze these .
they &apos;re difficult to look at even when you &apos;re used to them .
you have several different religions manifesting here .
most of the elements are from santeria healing rituals ,
but the upside @-@ down crucifix and the chalk drawings--
they &apos;re from a much darker religion .
unbaptized palo mayombe .
this is a significant change in the unsub &apos;s m.o.
he subdued the victim in the hallway prior to dragging him in here .
it doesn &apos;t suggest a consensual ritual .
he wanted the victim to know exactly what was coming .
and he took the head as well as the hands .
not exactly .
he took the brain .
and what is that ?
his tongue .
just when you think it can &apos;t get any worse .
and that ?
is that a dog ?
he had a chihuahua .
does that mean anything to you , professor ?
santeros don &apos;t sacrifice house pets ,
but there are palo mayombe rituals that use dogs .
palo is a secretive religion .
very hard to research .
mine will be the first academic work on the subject .
earlier you called it dark ,
but aren &apos;t all the african @-@ based syncretic religions amoral ?
i mean , it can be used for good or evil
depending on the practitioner , right ?
they &apos;re nature religions .
nature knows no right or wrong ,
only balance or imbalance .
so what makes palo darker than other religions ?
all the others achieve their goals by pleasing the orishas .
palo is the only one that harnesses the spirits of the dead
to accomplish its ends .
this is an nganga ,
the primary tool of a palero , a palo priest .
now , at its core is the nkisi ,
the spirit of the deceased who inhabits it .
many paleros believe that the fresher the brain in the skull ,
the more powerful the nganga is .
so what are you saying ,
this actually calls for a human sacrifice ?
no , no , no , not at all . usually a fresh brain
means digging up a recent grave
or getting one through donation .
i &apos;ve never heard of a palero killing to obtain one .
well , this may be a first .
does anything look out of place to you ?
outside of the human head , it all seems fairly traditional .
well , he cut off the victim &apos;s tongue
and put it in a dish .
does that have some kind of ritual meaning ?
it may be a sacrifice to ellegua
to silence informants ,
people who talk to outsiders , but usually you use a cow tongue .
let me ask you this . all of the victims
either had hands or fingers removed .
that &apos;s not good .
he maybe be building an nganga to kadiembempe ,
the deity that some call the devil .
it requires finger bones from 7 different corpses .
so far , he only has 4 .
we believe that our unsub is a lone male .
there is no evidence to suggest more than one individual
at any of the crime scenes .
he is behaviorally young , probably between 17 and 22 .
behaviorally ?
if he spent time in jail or been institutionalized ,
he could be chronologically older .
those lost years retard behavioral age .
he &apos;s part of the community ,
most likely hispanic or black .
we believe that he uses some sort of religious connection
to get close to his victims .
either santeria or palo mayombe .
obviously this is a very sensitive issue within the community .
he may be a practitioner
whom people trust and rely on for healing .
instead , he uses their vulnerability to prey on them .
he &apos;s highly organized in his planning ,
but then impulsive in his execution --
indicating that his emotions take over once he gets started .
this tells us that while he may think
that he has an objective reason for the killings ,
he actually has a compulsion
which is the real reason behind them .
and this has resulted in a
rapid escalation of his m.o. and his timeframe .
he &apos;s become more efficient and more violent .
this makes him unpredictable and even more dangerous .
he focuses on victims who are fragile and vulnerable
and then creates relationships with them .
you need to look for someone who has close access
to people in need .
he may work in a government aid office or a community center .
his coworkers will describe him ...
talk to me , garcia .
girl genius does it again .
according to the sign @-@ in logs ,
all of the victims were patrons
at that soup kitchen you visited yesterday .
you know i love you , right ?
what &apos;s not to love ?
bye .
he will have become moody and preoccupied ,
maybe even exhibited flashes of temper .
because of the age of his victims ,
we believe he may have been abused as a child
and is taking revenge on parental figures .
look for someone who &apos;s been in the juvenile system
or in foster care . thank you .
laroye !
laroye !
laroye .
laroye .
laroye .
laroye .
laroye .
we &apos;re with the fbi . we &apos;re not here to cause any trouble .
but , sir , please put that knife down .
this is a house of god .
you have no right to be here .
we just would like to ask you some questions .
we &apos;d appreciate it if you came with us voluntarily .
we &apos;re not here to create a spectacle .
i will go with you .
laroye !
ok , your bad boy grew up in foster care .
he did 15 years in apalachee correctional
for attempting to murder a police officer .
he was also a member of a violent street gang
known as los machetes .
subtle .
damn .
they like to cut off the hands
and sometime the heads of their victims .
can you get us some crime scene photos to look at ?
i &apos;ll get someone on it .
anything else , garcia ?
i can tell you that julio did his time without incident .
he was released in 2003 . he regularly visited his parole officer .
there are no waves in these crime waters
since he got out .
all right , thanks , baby girl .
i shall await further instruction .
this guy &apos;s been eyeballing the mirror since he got here .
let &apos;s see what he has to say .
wait , morgan . i think maybe i should go in first .
what ?
do you remember at the community center ,
he said he would come with me ?
if they already have a rapport ...
you want morgan to come with you ?
no , i &apos;m all right . thanks .
dave , you want to go to the
soup kitchen and check out his living space ,
take prentiss and seaver with you ?
there was a teenager . looked like his assistant .
he took over when we left .
my name is dr. spencer reid .
did you know these people ?
they are my godchildren .
they all came to me to be healed .
and you healed them .
you think i killed them .
the saints don &apos;t need a human sacrifice .
that is a man &apos;s sickness .
maybe it &apos;s not about sacrifice .
maybe someone needs body parts to build a nganga .
what do you know about palo ?
this light ...
is no good . it gives you a headache .
that &apos;s got prison corners .
15 years inside makes an impression .
is that blood ?
you wanted to see some of what los machetes does ?
that remind you of your youth ?
it &apos;s some pretty ugly things to be involved in .
did you help , or did you just watch ?
it looks like a kid lives here .
morgan said that julio had an assistant during the ritual .
a teenager .
look . more blood .
it looks like the kid had a side business .
smack .
is that what you call religion ?
what kind of man does that to another man ?
not a man of faith .
and interesting hobbies .
eggun buruku ni
ki ori baje ni
iche paraldo tete tete !
what the hell was that ?
i think i just witnessed a classic case
of transpossession .
it &apos;s a form of religious hysteria .
he wholeheartedly believes
he was being occupied by some form of deity .
he wasn &apos;t faking it ?
up close you can see physiological signs .
his body actually changed in response to the belief .
there have been a lot of studies of this phenomenon .
there was one case where an 80 @-@ year @-@ old woman
was able to lift a grown man above her head
when she believed she was occupied by her saint .
detective , did you understand what he was saying at the end ?
brother , look , i &apos;m a puerto rican catholic
that grew up in orlando .
that wasn &apos;t any language i ever heard .
i remember the words . i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be able to translate them .
you sure ?
that i remember them ?
that you want to go back in .
yeah .
is he all right ?
yeah , i think so .
but something weird was definitely going on in there .
what happened ?
you have no recollection ?
i remember talking about the lights .
you were talking about lights ,
and then you were talking about headaches .
that was my saint .
you &apos;re lucky ellegua spoke to you . what did he say ?
eggun buruku ni ki ori baje ni .
you have bad eggun on top of you
that &apos;s spoiling your head .
iche peraldo tete tete .
do a cleansing quickly .
what are eggun ?
spirits of the dead .
i didn &apos;t . why would you say that i--
i didn &apos;t .
well , why would your saint say
that they &apos;re spoiling my head ?
now , that &apos;s a question only you can answer .
something &apos;s wrong .
can you feel it ?
yeah . 4 people are dead .
i think maybe the fifth one is safe with you in here .
no , he &apos;s not .
someone &apos;s about to get hurt .
listen with your heart , not your head .
your helper , the kid that took over your ritual
when we brought you in here ?
elian .
my associates just found sale @-@ weight heroin in his room .
and an nganga .
where is he ?
he &apos;s running .
hey . calm down .
that was genuine .
you sound surprised .
and he cares about the kid .
well , he &apos;s no psychopath .
no , but maybe the boy is .
do we have a last name for elian ?
morales .
prentiss , have garcia find out what she can .
please , i gotta find him .
he &apos;s got nobody but me .
do you think it &apos;s possible that elian is our palero ?
no . no , he &apos;s a good kid .
then why did he run ?
he must be using again .
his mama and papa were junkies .
i took him in , got him clean ,
taught him right from wrong .
please . i gotta find him before he gets hurt .
the entire police force is out looking for him .
he &apos;s of the streets .
he &apos;s gonna go so far under , he &apos;ll be gone for good .
i &apos;m your best chance to find him .
just small stuff-- shoplifting , loitering--
wait .
uh , he was thrown in juvie hall for assault
last month .
complainant was julio ruiz .
tough love ?
charges were dropped . elian got out last week .
which is when the murders started .
thanks , garcia .
yeah .
elian &apos;s dependent on him ,
so he can &apos;t get revenge directly .
his rage against julio and his junkie parents
could be taken out on the victims .
so , uh , the blood on the head thing is goat .
but the pot that the kid had has 4 human fingers
and parts of a human brain in it .
and it &apos;s human blood on the sneaker . and one more thing--
the tongue and the hands were cut off antemortem .
the guy &apos;s torturing them now .
you know , you can &apos;t protect him if he did this .
i &apos;m not protecting him .
then what are you not telling us ?
if you want to help elian ,
you &apos;re gonna have to give us something that we don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll ask the orishas to help find this killer .
we don &apos;t have time for this , do we ?
if he ends with him helping us , yes , we do .
the orishas are with us now .
ok , we have 4 victims ,
all with cowrie shells in their mouths and eyes .
eleggua is called to find justice .
two of the victims had fingers cut off .
one had both hands removed .
and one had its head left on the scene ,
but the brain was missing .
they took the brain and left the head ?
the head was left at the crime scene .
no , that is not palo .
a palero would not leave the head .
he also left the tongue .
there is no use in the religion
for a tongue that is not pierced with needles .
it means nothing just to put a tongue in a dish .
if it &apos;s not part of the ritual ,
then it &apos;s the unsub &apos;s signature .
his psychopathy is showing .
so he &apos;s silencing someone through his victims .
and he enjoys it . he just didn &apos;t know it at first .
elian is an angry child ,
but he would not do this .
please , let me find him before it gets worse .
thank you for your help .
your head is spinning because it &apos;s full of ghosts .
you think you can do this work day in , day out
and you don &apos;t carry it with you ?
it &apos;s eating your soul .
ghosts ?
all right , so what have we got ?
a lot of evidence pointing to elian morales .
too much .
he fits the profile perfectly .
too perfectly . like every step was planned .
there are no fingerprints , but a single sneaker print .
and that sneaker turns up in the kid &apos;s room .
maybe somebody &apos;s framing elian , but who ?
someone with enough intelligence and control
to set up a very convincing trail .
somebody we &apos;ve met .
he &apos;s probably been watching us all along .
he began his killing for gain of some sort .
but his enjoyment of killing
is beginning to disrupt his organization .
he &apos;s demanding attention . maybe that &apos;s his game .
well , he got it . from the media , from the public , us .
that &apos;s it -- media attention .
but not for the killings , for the religion .
morgan , professor walker is about to
public a book on palo mayombe .
we showed him the photo of
the fourth victim &apos;s tongue in a dish
and he didn &apos;t say it wasn &apos;t right .
i mean , he of all people should have known
it didn &apos;t fit any ritual .
and that a palero would have taken the head .
but he wants us to believe that elian &apos;s a palero
and that these are religious killings .
and he did his research in the community .
he &apos;d be known and accepted .
he knows the rituals inside out .
maybe he gave the idol to the kid ,
pretending to train him as a witch doctor .
if elian was angry with julio ,
he may have been looking for another father figure .
elian was easy prey .
what better way to get publicity than a series of murders ?
yeah , garcia , get us everything you can
on professor walker &apos;s background .
and his address .
got that ?
let &apos;s go . we &apos;ll take the house ,
morgan and reid , take the office .
elian .
elian !
walker &apos;s prep school did a psych eval when he was 12 .
he did not exactly fit in .
no surprise there .
and his mother committed suicide
when he went away to boarding school ,
and to make things stranger and sadder ,
after she died , he spent all of his vacations at school .
what kind of father doesn &apos;t
bring his motherless kid home for the holidays ?
a crappy one .
his medical records
list a bunch of childhood injuries ,
including two spiral fractures
of the forearm and one broken collarbone .
well , two spiral fractures are unlikely to be accidents .
put that together with the mother &apos;s suicide ,
i think we &apos;re looking at an abusive father .
garcia , what can you find out about the father ?
a lot .
like what ?
he wrote 10 books , all on african religions .
the professor &apos;s in competition with the father .
yeah , and here &apos;s the kicker .
his son is mentioned in this article
and that he &apos;s up for tenure in the same field .
hotch .
the professor &apos;s not at this house . you got anything ?
no , there &apos;s no one here either .
we &apos;re gonna look around .
guys , neighbors reported a disturbance
at the soup kitchen .
let &apos;s go , reid .
there &apos;s nothing unusual upstairs .
reid &apos;s going through julio &apos;s room
to see if we missed anything .
they found these in the refrigerator .
looks like he dug those up .
those weren &apos;t there when we were here earlier .
they were planted to make it look like
elian completed the ritual .
which means the professor &apos;s ready to wrap this up .
up till now , all the victims
have been killed in their homes .
it looks like the body was dragged that way ,
but the trail stops .
walker laid that trail . he wants us to think
that he took julio out the front door .
but , really , he could be anywhere .
they are ghosts .
all of the victims were killed in their homes .
reid ?
you really shouldn &apos;t be here .
i &apos;ll check down there .
reid !
get inside .
you &apos;re a professor and you &apos;re very smart .
you &apos;re a lot smarter than this .
smarter .
prentiss , is reid out front with you ?
no . no one &apos;s come out since you went inside .
your gun , please . toss it over there .
people like you and i don &apos;t need guns .
like you and i.
yeah . men of intelligence .
oh , we &apos;re the same ?
shut up .
i think that there are some similarities .
i mean , uh , we both love books .
books ?
he &apos;s not answering his phone .
you shut up . shut up .
you know what ? i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t believe that you killed
all these people just to sell a book .
oh , really ?
elian will die of an overdose
after killing his santero for his fingers .
it will all make sense to the police .
reid &apos;s vest ?
well , this is not good .
how are you going to explain me ?
elian will have killed you , too .
have we not established how ill he is ?
he &apos;s been on a palo rampage .
everyone will want to learn about the religion
that drove the boy crazy .
will you shut up !
wait a minute , rossi .
that &apos;s the building right out here .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i don &apos;t believe that this is about a book .
and i don &apos;t think that you do , either .
excuse me ?
i--i think it &apos;s more about the abuse , the abandonment ,
and the lack of attention from your father .
that &apos;s enough .
you know what the ridiculous thing is ,
is that you--
you set up a paradigm where you actually have to get caught .
think about it . if you get away with this ,
your father will never know that you did any of it .
what is wrong with you ?
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just very bright in here for me .
bright ?
please turn the lights off .
the light--what are you--
just shut up ! just shut--
fbi ! fbi !
we &apos;re going to need an ambulance .
get and ambulance .
elian &apos;s been overdosed with heroin .
don &apos;t hurt me .
you have the right to remain silent . use it .
do you think he &apos;ll come to see me in jail ?
do you think he &apos;ll visit ?
who ?
my father .
he &apos;ll hear about this , right ? i &apos;ll be pretty famous .
oh , he &apos;s gonna hear about it , all right .
you heard me calling .
what ?
you heard me calling . that &apos;s why you came .
julio , i found a photograph of you in front of this building .
that &apos;s how i found you .
you don &apos;t really believe that , do you ?
that you just happened to see a photograph ?
this is orula &apos;s ide . it will protect you .
i don &apos;t need it anymore , but ...
you do .
what do you need protecting from ?
i have no idea .
are you all right ?
yeah . oh , yeah , i--i am .
i pretended to have a headache in order to distract him .
pretended .
yeah , pretended .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i &apos;m not sure what you want me to say .
so there &apos;s nothing wrong ?
well , your scans are perfectly normal ,
and there doesn &apos;t seem to be any physical explanation
for your headaches .
well , what do i do now ?
well , have you considered ...
considered what ?
a psychosomatic cause .
psychosomatic ?
it just means a mental or emotional stress--
i know what psychosomatic means , doctor , but it &apos;s not that .
well , i think it &apos;s something we should consider .
it &apos;s not--i &apos;m not crazy .
crazy ? dr. reid , i &apos;m not saying--
i have headaches . i have intense sensitivity to light
because there &apos;s something wrong with me
physically , not mentally . it &apos;s not that .
that ?
listen , doctor , my mother &apos;s a paranoid schizophrenic
who &apos;s been institutionalized ,
so i know very well what mental illness looks like ,
maybe even better than you , and it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s not .
&quot; the best and most beautiful things in life
&quot; cannot be seen or even touched .
they must be felt with the heart . &quot;
