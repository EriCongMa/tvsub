第六季 第二集
yahoo !
chomsky , come here .
come here , chomsky .
abed , i &apos;m really sorry .
i told you cats don &apos;t like me .
they consider me a competitor because of
my natural stealth and ambivalence .
oh , did she get high again and forget she doesn &apos;t wear contacts ?
before britta moved her cats into our apartment ,
she wanted to introduce them to us on neutral ground .
one of them scratched abed and ran under the couch .
oh , i &apos;ll get it .
cats love me .
what ? are you sure ?
hello there .
well , she is . is it a he or a she ?
he .
well , he &apos;s really got his teeth in my flesh right now .
okay , he &apos;s touching bone .
i &apos;m just waiting for him to finish up .
not a lot i can do at this point .
this was a pretty big mistake .
okay . this is done .
see you tomorrow .
i &apos;m pretty embarrassed about this .
chomsky .
i didn &apos;t know britta was moving in with annie and abed .
that &apos;s- .
expository ?
yeah , britta &apos;s fallen on hard times and
our apartment is the cheapest game in town .
abed , it &apos;s a little embarrassing when you put it that way .
britta &apos;s a rich genius with super powers
and she &apos;s gonna live on our sofa for no reason .
oh , no .
dinosaurs . my tax documents .
facts about native americans .
just kidding .
guess what i just purchased for the school
from a local manufacturer ,
greendale &apos;s first virtual reality operating system .
did greendale need a virtual reality system ?
like a hole in the head .
a hole in the head is something that you don &apos;t need .
she said through a huge hole in her head .
didn &apos;t vr go out in the 90s ?
the last people i saw using it were in the honeycomb hideout .
we mock what we don &apos;t understand .
we also mock what &apos;s silly .
jeffrey .
abed , you &apos;re more machine than man .
you wanna give me a hand setting up the equipment after lunch ?
we &apos;re all going to help britta move into our place today .
jeffrey ?
britta , something &apos;s come up . i &apos;d love to .
oh , yeah , yeah , at least you don &apos;t have to bust out your usual excuse .
you don &apos;t know for sure that i &apos;m not a veteran ,
and nobody can say for sure that today isn &apos;t veteran &apos;s day .
hi . i got bit by a cat .
chang , we know .
why are you guys and all these books in the nurse &apos;s office ?
dean , where did you get this ,
and for how much of the school &apos;s money ?
relax , my little bean countess .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you pay me to worry about that .
oh , and how much do i pay you ?
that &apos;s you . it was only $ 5000 .
what ?
frankie , jack me up .
i would like to see this company &apos;s website .
can i use your computer ?
sure .
have fun in the stone age
while i step into the third dean @-@ mension .
width ?
read the instructions , analog man .
when entering virtual reality ,
you should calibrate the system by looking at your own hands ,
then turning them over and looking at the backs of them
with a sense of wonder .
roger that .
to the virtue good 6500 .
initiate calibration .
it &apos;s incredible .
i can see all around .
i gotta take a closer look at these structures , they &apos;re !
i &apos;m walking !
i am walking .
my god .
i know what this is .
i set the time zone .
i set the time zone .
and my phone does that automatically .
i &apos;m gonna see if i can make the font bigger .
the font is larger .
and jesus wept , for there were no more worlds to conquer .
thank you , guys , again , so much .
i know that i already owe you you money but
i want you to know that i got a new bartending job
with better hours and free corn nuts
which i feel like have a small but significant resale value .
i feel like everybody &apos;s talking about
that haircut i gave vicki , so- .
oh , britta .
can i
it &apos;s okay .
do i do this too ? okay .
this is going to be good for all of us , right ?
it &apos;s like a fresh start .
oh , did you guys get a new couch ?
we got it for you .
it has a pull @-@ out .
you guys .
i wanted a murphy bed for shenanigans
but the cost to shenanigan ratio was too high .
how did you guys afford this ?
don &apos;t worry .
we got a good deal .
for pick up , perry . why &apos;s my name on here ?
because we got it for you .
and we told the sales guy that .
so . so he put your friend &apos;s name on the delivery slip ?
that seems weird , right ?
roommate movie night !
roommate movie night , yay !
portuguese gremlins .
portuguese gremlins , ooh .
it &apos;s portugal &apos;s answer to gremlins if gremlins &apos; question was
how can you totally rip us off without spending any money
and having watched us maybe twice ?
that &apos;s what the portuguese gremlins say , right ?
it &apos;s close enough .
i did it .
it &apos;s 2 : 39 .
that was the time when you started setting the time .
it &apos;s 20 minutes later now .
the power .
the facility .
jesus wept .
stop saying jesus wept .
dean , here &apos;s something fun you might want to try .
let &apos;s see if we can find the serial number to this system .
如需退换好真实6500虚拟实境系统 需确认系统独一无二的序列号
oh , that could be fun .
so go to settings .
is settings the volcano or the cobbler &apos;s workshop ?
it &apos;s a monastery .
i feel the power .
welcome to settings .
your majesty , the filing tabs .
you &apos;re looking for one called purchase info .
these cabinets would never be this easy to climb in real life .
this is the future of scrolling .
my world is officially boundless .
i &apos;m here .
inside that drawer should be a file called serial number .
i &apos;ve got it !
all right .
now you just have to print that file out .
you can do that by dragging it to the accessories
and peripherals castle , and planting it in the printer driver .
what &apos;s so funny ?
i mean , besides everything ?
i have no intention of returning this system .
on the contrary , i intend to keep it .
dear god .
delete !
one file selected .
hold on .
file sorted .
what ? oh come on .
come here you little .
file deleted .
jesus wept !
he deleted the serial number , jeff , help me out here .
i don &apos;t get paid enough for this .
how much do you think you &apos;re going to get paid
if i have to find five grand in the budget ?
you &apos;re not the new annie .
you &apos;re the new abed .
i don &apos;t know what that means yet .
so are the gremlins supposed to be the good guys in this version ?
the blue ones are . the green ones are bad
and the red ones are kind of like isolationists .
it &apos;s a metaphor for world war ii .
alma , i will be right back , i left something in my car .
hi , yes , i picked up a sofa from your store , recently .
the last name is perry .
what ?
are you strong or angry ?
my parents ?
my parents bought that couch ?
explain yourselves !
well , are we , okay .
they kind of reached out to us on facebook .
what ? you know i don &apos;t talk to them .
well , yeah . that &apos;s why they talk to us .
they knew you wouldn &apos;t let them help you , at least not directly .
oh my god . oh my god .
you needed our help , but we needed their help to help you .
that &apos;s why we were able to get you such a good deal on the rent .
they &apos;re supplementing my rent too ?
you make them sound like monsters ,
but they &apos;re actually really nice .
well , they are !
my parents are horrible people .
you &apos;re being dramatic .
oh yeah .
that &apos;s what people say when they take your soul ,
and they rip it out of your chest
and then shove it in your mouth .
i got bit by a cat .
i will create more worlds .
and those worlds will have worlds .
they &apos;re file folders , stop calling them worlds .
i found an address .
elroy ptasnik , founder of virtu good technologies .
all right . i &apos;ll go see if i can get the school &apos;s money back .
you keep white morpheus inside the matrix .
jeff .
britta . you look distraught .
you have ten seconds to tell me it &apos;s not about stupid politics .
i just found out that annie and abed
have been cheating on me with my parents .
they &apos;ve been sabotaging my life from the shadows
by paying off my debts and buying me things .
thank god .
what are you ? thank god ?
the charade can finally end .
now you know everything you thought you owed us ,
you can actually just owe to deb and george .
deb and george ?
you know my parents too ? since when ?
i don &apos;t know , since thousands of dollars ago ?
i &apos;m bad with dates .
i remember the new year &apos;s glasses having zeros for eyes .
and when did stella get her groove back ?
you &apos;ve all been lying to me for years .
what kind of friends are you ?
poor . we &apos;re poor friends .
and you mooch off us because you &apos;re too proud
to use your own support system .
what kind of friend are you ?
and having met them ,
what were you rebelling against ?
was it generosity ,
whimsical game nights ,
or delicious lobster bacon mashed potatoes ?
you ate the potatoes ?
you , you don &apos;t even eat carbs .
i eat love , britta .
hot , delicious love that you were willing to wipe your ass with .
oh , my god .
i have no friends .
can we not be so dramatic about this ?
there are people in this world with serious problems .
chang , go see the nurse !
i &apos;m trying .
不是好 而是好真实
yeah ?
elroy ptasnik ?
who &apos;s asking ?
well , that &apos;s always a yes .
nobody ever says , who &apos;s asking , to the wrong name .
they just say , that &apos;s not my name .
when my phone rings and i say hello ,
and they say , is pablo there ?
i don &apos;t say , who &apos;s asking , i say , wrong number .
you &apos;re a clever young man .
i &apos;m 40 .
come in .
so ?
you sold a virtu good 6500
to craig pelton at greendale community college ,
and we need to return it .
i &apos;ll need the serial number .
he deleted the serial number because he loves the system .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
the problem is in order to copy a file ,
you have to throw a fireball at it ,
then absorb the fire ,
then drop the flaming file into a crystal lake ,
then take out both copies and throw them into the side of a mountain .
worlds within worlds .
that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
i can copy a file by holding my finger down on a phone .
well , so can a monkey .
now , you &apos;re describing a system for animals .
terrestrial slobs bound to the earth by their meaty feet .
i designed a system for gods .
oh , come on .
you know what you &apos;ve done .
you know how lame virtual reality is .
you know the damage it caused mid @-@ 90s cinema .
i mean , michael douglas walking around like a jackass ,
moving files with a magic glove ?
lawnmower man ? did you see lawnmower man ?
you bet your sweet ass i saw lawnmower man .
i consulted on it .
took brigitte nielsen to the premiere .
we were building worlds within worlds .
and now you &apos;re living in homes within campers within parking lots ,
and using an ipad to clearly design
what looks like a ripoff of angry birds .
get out .
get out of my winnebago !
you &apos;re not allowed to say that like it &apos;s a punishment .
i know what it &apos;s like to lie for a living , elroy !
and you should know , it feels better to stop .
and my feet aren &apos;t meaty !
britta , honey .
an unexpected treat .
this is a check for all the dirty money
you have used to control and monitor me without my consent .
but we &apos;re not gonna cash this .
well you can &apos;t . i postdated it a year .
and in that year , i &apos;m gonna get a new job , new friends ,
in a new city where you and your spies
can never find me .
oh , please . don &apos;t do this .
what choice do you leave me ?
who acts this dishonestly towards their own daughter ?
what choice do you leave us ?
i mean , every time we get too close , you run off .
we sent you a birthday card to your apartment in new york ,
and then next week you &apos;re setting fire to a jamba juice in san jose .
how long is that gonna stick with me ?
until arson is legal , sweetie , but your father &apos;s point is ,
we &apos;ve arrived at the closest relationship you can tolerate .
we &apos;ve learned , after a decade ,
how to love and admire and finance you from afar ,
through your friends , and the social media .
the tinder and the like .
it &apos;s called tumblr , dad .
no , i mean tinder . it &apos;s a matchmaking app ,
and by the way , if you were on tinder ,
your mom and i think you &apos;d be the prettiest .
absolutely , the boys would be swiping right .
or girls ! whatever makes you happy .
yes !
totally .
what has happened to you two ?
who are these doddering open @-@ minded geezers ?
where are the people who wouldn &apos;t let me
dress up like prince for halloween ?
or told me that the cat ran away because i tried alcohol ?
or had me drug tested when i was 11
because they said i was laughing too much ?
we are definitely sorry about all of that stuff .
quite frankly , we don &apos;t remember that stuff .
oh , it &apos;s true .
woodstock , oh !
oh , my god .
i remember woodstock !
woodstock was amazing but--
but you have to realize , britta ,
that your woodstock , which was us being bad parents ,
that has more to do with you .
so that &apos;s what you remember , see ?
where are they ?
i &apos;m sorry .
get out here !
britta , let me explain .
we were worried about you , so we just came over .
you can explain to each other in hell .
friends don &apos;t visit each other &apos;s parents .
i hope you have a wonderful life .
george , george , yes .
britta , at least take some money and fix your car !
or at least get a cab ,
or there are apps we can call where strangers pick you up .
i don &apos;t want your help .
stop infantilizing me !
hey , stop . stop !
get out of here .
green machine , nice .
here , greg , here , take some cash .
holy crap !
what &apos;s her problem ?
she &apos;s growing up .
oh my god .
i put a tilde on this n !
i can do anything .
any luck ?
ugh , i &apos;m going home .
oh , and to warn you , he joked about wanting a pee jar earlier
and it &apos;s gradually becoming less of a joke .
hey , dean .
i &apos;m coming over and i &apos;m pulling you out of there .
i &apos;ll bite you .
i &apos;ll beat you up .
i &apos;ll like it and then i &apos;ll fire you
and then i &apos;ll get right back in it .
i &apos;ll still get to beat you up .
hold it . hold it .
who is that ? i recognize that baritone voice and
the scent of tic tacs with a tinge of naugahyde .
it &apos;s elroy patashnik .
the architect .
listen , i &apos;ve come to tell you something very important about this system .
it &apos;s lame .
what ?
i wasted your time with it and
10 crucial years of america &apos;s time .
i &apos;m giving mr. williams your refund .
i don &apos;t want a refund .
i wanna stay in here forever
and you can &apos;t stop me .
die .
how long has he been in there ?
four hours .
oh , i was thinking weeks .
this guy runs your school ?
to use a phrase i coined in the 90s ,
i &apos;m going in .
you coined that ?
oh yeah , lock and load .
that &apos;s mine too .
all right .
i &apos;m awake .
oh my god !
i &apos;m so sorry , i &apos;m so sorry , i &apos;m so sorry .
what are you doing in my car ?
i didn &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
no where else but my car ?
do you know how big the planet is ?
what is going on , britta ?
my friends , they all think my parents are adorable ,
and they think that i &apos;m the bad guy for hating them ,
but i have a right to hate them , cuz i had to be there when they sucked .
yeah . jimmy fallon syndrome . i get it .
i had that with my parents , too .
you did ?
yeah .
you know , one of the most unfair lessons we &apos;re forced to learn
is that our parents are human beings .
we wanna think of them as gods or demons ,
because then that would make us heroes .
but give me a break .
we all suck .
what can i do to help you tonight , brita ?
how many quarters were in this cup holder ?
the same amount .
oh , yeah .
calibrated . welcome .
no , go away !
preferences grow .
no , no , no .
let go of me .
do you really want the power of a god ?
yes , more than anything .
should i order dinner , cuz a lot of good delivery places are closing ?
i know how you feel .
the sadder reality , the less real we want it .
i just wanna be a good dean .
i can give you a device that will accomplish that .
you can use this to manipulate worlds .
flick of a wrist .
my god , it &apos;s incredible !
now !
what &apos;s happening . no !
i wanna go back in .
i want to be back in there .
i want to be- .
here . here .
here &apos;s your power .
yeah . now , manipulate worlds .
yeah .
he &apos;ll be back to his old self in an hour .
great , do you have a way to fix that ?
seriously , though , thank you .
brita , we were so worried .
what happened to the kids green machine ?
what ? i , i don &apos;t know . i ditched it .
where and how long ago ?
okay , assume that &apos;s not what &apos;s important here .
brita , we- . - it &apos;s okay , dad .
i have something that i wanna say .
i ran away from home at 17 to become an adult ,
but maybe all that did was leave a part of me stuck at 17,
the part that tends to run away when i am confronted with the truth .
the truth is good , brita .
mom , shut up !
frankie taught me something important .
it doesn &apos;t matter how mature we are
or what resentments we carry .
all that matters is that we &apos;re all going to die .
you have a lovely home .
thank you .
so , we &apos;re really getting our daughter back ?
yeah , but it &apos;s not gonna be that big of a deal .
i mean , you guys missed the good years .
now , it &apos;s just gonna be margaritas , pottery barn ,
fighting our family &apos;s tendency toward obesity
as we slide into oblivion .
first you guys , and then me quickly thereafter .
well , i &apos;ll drink to that .
oh , abed .
benjamin .
i got bit by a cat , deb .
no !
i &apos;ll get the antibiotics .
thank you for the refund , elroy .
no , thank you
for one last taste of what it was like when my work was valuable .
oh , it &apos;s still valuable .
here , $ 500
for the taste i got of being powerful .
dean , the school can &apos;t afford 500- .
wait for it .
i have no idea what to do with the rest of my life now .
we offer a wide variety of classes .
and that , my friend , is the greendale effect .
i &apos;ll never get out of here , will i ?
i haven &apos;t met many that do .
let &apos;s walk arm in arm .
there are times when change needs to be different ,
then there &apos;s changes that are more the same .
but the same changes don &apos;t tend to be different
than the changes that came before .
if you change everything that &apos;s different ,
sometimes you find out everything &apos;s still the same .
as for me , i &apos;m just changing
everything that &apos;s different .
change .
