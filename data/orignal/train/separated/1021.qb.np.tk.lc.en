who is that ?
agent garrett fowler .
i gave you the box , kate , and i never hear from you again .
alex !
here . i don &apos;t need all the heat this is gonna bring .
i deciphered the phone number
that kate dialed from the plane .
i traced it to a store @-@ bought burner phone .
so no names associated with it .
not yet .
whatever this thing &apos;s hiding , it &apos;s not the music .
i think it &apos;s a keyhole .
a key to what ?
that &apos;s the last piece of the music box .
i &apos;m giving up my obsession .
are you suggesting i give up mine ?
marshals monitor the anklet .
yes , one of these keys goes to your anklet .
i know who kate called from the plane .
it was the fbi agent
who set up the deal between you and kate .
garrett fowler .
now i need to find him .
is this a good idea ?
you have a better one ?
no .
you think mozzie can do this ?
oh , he is a savant when it comes to things like this .
rain man . i get it .
you should see him with a rubik &apos;s cube .
probably can do it with his feet , right ?
30 seconds , socks on or off .
this is the single greatest day
of his life .
yep .
all the conspiracy theories have come true .
we &apos;ve been so close ,
and now we finally meet .
i told you .
i agreed with you .
shush !
no , there &apos;s no shushing .
no shushing for you .
you ready to record this ?
yes , but ...
first walk me through it .
all right . pay attention .
this is where it gets good .
we noticed this broken piece ...
wasn &apos;t broken .
it &apos;s a keyhole .
yep .
and this is the key .
there &apos;s a second comb .
yep . we snap it into place .
you ready ?
yeah .
any idea what kind of code it is ?
sounds could correspond to numbers , wavelengths .
pala &apos;s discovery of hidden music in &quot; the last supper . &quot;
runescape &apos;s encoded flute solo !
don &apos;t forget &quot; close encounters . &quot;
geographical coordinates encoded ...
... in five tones .
very good , suit .
clearly we &apos;re in good hands .
yeah .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting this out of harm &apos;s way .
and i am keeping this .
that &apos;s a good idea .
if we defang the box ,
we can use it to lure out fowler .
no way .
tomorrow , you and me .
it &apos;s back to business as usual .
yeah .
oh . business as usual .
us without the box .
how old is this code ?
hard to say .
the last credible report
has the box disappearing from konigsberg castle in &apos; 45 .
now , assuming no one has reunited
the cherub and the box since then ...
wait , wait .
the box and the key were together the day we stole it .
alex .
she had them both before she brought the box back to me .
well , she obviously inserted the key and found the comb .
so why &apos;d she give it back ?
couldn &apos;t solve it herself ?
or she took something out of it .
or she knows something we don &apos;t .
she could be a step ahead of us .
yeah .
we really should talk to her .
it &apos;s too bad she disappeared to italy .
mm , maybe .
hey . you know where alex is , don &apos;t you ?
i have an idea .
how did mozzie do ?
better than i expected .
i &apos;m convinced . he &apos;s the cherub for the job .
and what about neal ? how &apos;s he doing with all this ?
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s interested in the music box .
i think he just wants to find fowler .
see what he knows about kate &apos;s death .
well , speaking of fowler ,
we got a blip on the radar .
an old bank account .
someone checked the balance .
can you trace it ?
no . it was done remotely .
200 bucks in the account ?
yeah , he emptied his accounts when he went underground ,
but he didn &apos;t get much .
maybe he &apos;s desperate for cash .
what are you thinking ?
do you know about his wife &apos;s death ?
she was killed during a robbery a few years ago .
back when he was working violent crimes for the bureau .
suspicious circumstances surrounded her murder .
that kept the insurance company
from finalizing their claim .
we could make it look like the claim finally came through .
put a stack of cash in the account .
if he bites , we can track the withdrawal .
in the meantime , make sure that stays safe .
what bushes did you rustle to uncover alex &apos;s trail ?
remember that silver collection
she fenced a few years ago ?
the spanish pieces from the almiranta shipwreck ?
they &apos;re popping up again , one at a time .
hale .
i don &apos;t like loitering .
neal !
i really appreciate this .
so , what happened to your goatee ?
you know i liked it .
we all grow up .
all children ...
except one .
did you bring it ?
it &apos;s from the almiranta .
who &apos;s the fence ?
anonymous .
the thief ?
it &apos;s the third piece of shipwreck silver
i &apos;ve had come through this month .
someone &apos;s been busy .
too busy .
i like that &quot; someone . &quot;
so you should warn her the nypd is on the trail .
if they make the almiranta connection ...
understood .
what do i owe you for this ?
we all go way back .
just remember me fondly when you pull the next job .
well , that might be a while .
or it might not .
he thinks it &apos;s alex ...
she knows how valuable this stuff is ,
and she knows where it is .
she &apos;s stealing back her own stuff .
when the nypd realizes it &apos;s all from the same collection ...
they &apos;ll set a trap .
unless we get to her first .
oh , that would take fbi resources
we don &apos;t have access to .
i can get those .
how ?
i con the fbi .
peter said it is time to get back to business as usual .
following standard peter protocol ,
that means he &apos;ll try to pull from the reserve
of active case files ,
which i am allowed to take home and peruse .
exhibits &quot; a , &quot; i presume ?
yes .
they range from mortgage fraud to copyright infringement
back to mortgage fraud .
sorry , i just dozed off .
i know .
but peter always tries to find a diamond in the rough .
so you want to create a diamond for him to find .
exactly .
if we can forge a case file linking the silver thefts ,
he won &apos;t be able to resist it .
and then he &apos;ll think he found the case himself .
it &apos;s brilliant !
hello , hello .
june .
sorry to interrupt your project ,
but i will be leaving town for a few days ,
so , as per our agreement ...
oh , you want me to walk bugsy .
please . he loves your company .
you got it .
okay .
thank you . bye @-@ bye , you two .
uh , so she has you dog whispering ?
small price to pay .
where were we ?
hale told us when the silver pieces started coming in ,
we know alex &apos;s m.o. ,
and i created this .
you named alex &quot; the silver burglar &quot; ?
all right , i admit it lacks a certain flair .
but it makes the point .
it includes the police reports for the stolen items ,
and i &apos;ve added just enough fbi research
to connect the dots .
uh , your file &apos;s a tad too nice
to have been floating around the bureau .
so we age it . just like a painting .
get in the mind of the file .
live the life of the file .
hear the pulse of the file !
can we do this ?
please .
step one --
the case file is assembled by our clerk , janice .
she merges all the various reports ...
oh . probably over lunch .
she logs in the police reports
and staples them together .
oh . looks like she forgot a page .
nice .
now , our probee usually brings her coffee .
it &apos;s an excuse to flirt .
oh , he &apos;s left @-@ handed .
then it goes to susan ,
who highlights the pertinents .
oh , she &apos;s the eau de parfum ?
she is .
what are you doing ?
oh . this is the first burglary victim .
susan sees the name and then starts humming .
mr. gordon ?
he was a county commissioner .
commissioner gordon .
batman
no one will know what song you hummed when we did this .
live the file .
next .
then it gets approved by hughes .
now , his signature is tricky .
he has his assistant sign for him ...
so ...
oh . forging the forger .
nicely done .
now it gets passed around the office a few times .
nice one .
now i slip it in with the rest of the files .
oh . hey , honey .
hey , hon .
hey , buddy . how you doing ? good .
he &apos;s in trouble .
ooh , chinese .
yeah . satchmo got into the quiche i made .
bad dog .
thank you .
oh , so the reserve box , huh ?
looking for your next case ?
yeah , it &apos;s time for neal and me to get back to basics .
want to help ?
no .
good .
all right , what do we got ?
antitrust lawsuit .
yeah . does that sound interesting ?
no , actually , boring .
all right . let &apos;s see ...
medicare scam .
okay , well , you sighed , so we &apos;re gonna pass on that one .
oh , look at this one .
cat burglar . that &apos;s kind of sexy .
someone smells good .
that would be susan . let me see that .
yeah .
oh , yeah .
look good ?
this should do the trick .
oh , i know that look .
you got your eye on a new bad guy .
ah , got our next case .
what do you know about stolen spanish silver ?
do you even have to ask ?
oh , just once i wish i did .
a silver thief .
i &apos;ve heard good things .
thought you might like this .
cat burglary . love it .
why are you humming ?
something in the file .
popped into my head .
all right , settle down , kids .
nypd has been investigating
a series of silver heists .
the thief breaks through the window
and then cleans out the place .
but here &apos;s what nypd missed .
all the thefts included at least one piece
from a 17th @-@ century shipwreck ,
the almiranta .
if we can figure out who else owns pieces from that shipwreck ...
we can predict who &apos;s gonna be hit next .
now , insurance policies
are giving us three potential targets .
we &apos;re gonna stake out all of them .
this couple called in a vacation watch to their alarm company .
they &apos;ll be gone for a week starting tomorrow .
that &apos;s a lot of lonely silver .
then that &apos;s the address we &apos;ll take .
this should be fun .
batman
yeah .
you were right . we got a hit .
fowler &apos;s insurance settlement .
deposited yesterday .
a portion was withdrawn within 40 minutes .
atm ?
on 32nd street .
i did a radius check ,
pulled traffic cams near the area --
got these .
hello , garrett .
yep . i &apos;m heading out to take a look .
diana , last time fowler ...
tried to shoot me ?
yeah , i &apos;m not gonna give him another chance .
easy ! amadeus .
additive code ...
morse , baudot ...
set theory , logarithmic , and geographic --
every kind of cipher .
unless , um ...
&quot; glarvendkkgll ... &quot;
means something to you , then it &apos;s still just noise .
is there anyone who can help you with this ?
there &apos;s one guy .
he works at an antique store in the west 30s .
oh . code breaker ?
code maker .
has a rep for hiding codes in gadgets .
government job ?
yes . just not our government .
and you trust him ?
well , i trust him enough
to play him a partial piece of it
and not tell him where it came from .
maybe alex will have our answers .
oh , sure .
perhaps she decoded it already
using a stolen silver tea set .
how are you gonna talk to alex , anyway ?
the fbi &apos;s staking out a penthouse .
she always does rooftop recon one block away .
oh . tell her i said &quot; ciao . &quot;
will do .
where &apos;s caffrey ?
oh his way .
fowler ?
he was staying in short @-@ term housing
a block from that atm .
the clerk i.d. &apos; d him off the pictures .
he &apos;s going by the name aaron burgis .
he left two days ago .
any hits on that alias ?
yeah . and it &apos;s a big one .
you sure it &apos;s fowler ?
are you gonna tell neal ?
i don &apos;t know if he can handle it .
they &apos;re on vacation in miami .
look down .
to the right .
the municipal utility van .
caffrey .
you &apos;re looking very &quot; to catch a thief &quot; tonight .
i hope you don &apos;t think i &apos;m the little french girl
and you &apos;re cary grant in this scenario .
i &apos;d like to think there are similarities .
but i &apos;m not here to turn you in .
right . you were just in the neighborhood .
if i could reach you like a regular person ,
maybe it wouldn &apos;t have to be this way .
sorry . it &apos;s kind of hard to keep in touch
with this bull &apos;s @-@ eye on my back .
so you come out at night to steal the things you fenced ,
then fence them again ?
i don &apos;t have the luxury to be creative .
who else knows i &apos;m here ?
just me and moz .
oh , and the nypd if you keep going .
they &apos;re close to linking the thefts , alex .
i used my friends in the van to get to you first .
why ?
the music box .
you found the code .
tell me you cracked it .
i &apos;m lurking on a rooftop ,
spying into people &apos;s windows .
do you think i cracked it ?
i can get that target off your back once and for all .
how ?
hit somewhere else tonight .
what &apos;s my take ?
the music box .
deja vu , neal . we &apos;ve done this .
third time &apos;s a charm .
the box is sitting in a safe in diana barrigan &apos;s apartment .
who is she ?
fbi agent .
you want me to break into a fed &apos;s apartment ?
yeah . she &apos;s sitting down in that van right now .
and her girlfriend works the night shift .
girlfriend ? that must kill you .
so what do i do with it once i get it ?
return it to the rightful owners .
give it to the russian museum .
the person who wants it will take his eye off you
and put it on them .
what do you say ? you &apos;re already dressed for it .
fowler just became the priority .
i need you to look into everything fowler did with this alias ,
leading up to the explosion and after .
off the normal channels ?
stay away from the office . can you work from home ?
i prefer it .
good .
hey . where are you going ?
i &apos;m headed home .
why ? why ? i thought we were all surveiling tonight .
you guys are fine without me .
oh , come on . but it &apos;s the van .
the van &apos;s fun .
you hate the van .
i like the van when diana &apos;s in it .
you &apos;re the only thing that smells good in here .
then take your last whiff , because i &apos;m leaving .
all right , diana has more important things to do
than be your potpourri .
besides ...
i have something important i need to tell you .
what &apos;s up ?
you won &apos;t admit it , you won &apos;t show it ,
but i know how difficult these last few months
have been to you .
i &apos;m glad that you trusted me .
of course .
i &apos;m returning the favor .
this is a receipt for parts used
in making the bomb on kate &apos;s plane .
it says the buyer &apos;s name is aaron burgis .
do you know who that is ?
it &apos;s fowler &apos;s alias .
diana tracked his purchases and found that .
made one week before the explosion .
fowler bought the explosives and put them on the plane .
you okay ?
yeah .
we &apos;re closing in on fowler .
diana has a lead .
good .
neal .
good .
christie ?
are you okay ?
yeah .
i &apos;m not surprised .
part of me knew it had to be fowler .
if we get him now , we can put him away .
diana .
is neal with you ?
yes .
what &apos;s going on ?
someone just broke into my house .
the music box is gone .
what ?
don &apos;t do this , neal .
tell me you didn &apos;t do this .
do what ?
tell me you didn &apos;t steal the music box .
what are you talking about ? i &apos;m right here .
it &apos;s been safe in diana &apos;s apartment for months ,
and the minute i tell you about it , it disappears .
i didn &apos;t take it .
you &apos;re not gonna get away with this .
you &apos;re not .
russian heritage museum received an anonymous gift .
seems an antique music box was left in their delivery drop .
they &apos;re doing a public showing sunday ?
by invitation only ,
before they ship it back to st. petersburg .
thanks .
neal .
get up here .
wish me luck .
you knew the russians would want to show this off .
you &apos;re trying to lure fowler out .
someone is .
oh , would you stop ?
you can skip the viewing .
oh , no . i &apos;ll be there , but you won &apos;t .
you &apos;re liability . you &apos;re benched .
you can &apos;t pull me off this , peter .
i can do whatever i want with you .
you &apos;re lucky that i don &apos;t put you in lockdown .
get out .
mozzie mozzie !
konnichiwa , my friend .
i have something very intriguing for you .
oh , yes .
it is .
um , can you make a copy ?
oh . of course .
got my eyes on you .
oh . this is a surprise .
you come here to add to your stuffed @-@ squirrel collection ?
oh . well , let &apos;s just say my day opened up .
oh ! how did your black @-@ on @-@ black affair go ?
i found alex .
that &apos;s good .
she has no idea how to solve the code .
that &apos;s bad .
and i got benched by peter .
what happened ?
i had alex steal the box from diana
and i donate it to the russians .
oh , god .
you &apos;re trying to draw him out .
fowler bought the explosives that blew up kate &apos;s plane .
oh , neal --
very interesting .
oh , excellent . he can help us .
two @-@ parter .
two @-@ part code . interesting idea .
we can each take half .
as they say , divide and conquer .
brilliant mind .
akihiro , you flatter me .
what he said was --
yeah . yeah , i @-@ i heard him .
oh , yeah . okay . sure .
um , a @-@ are you okay ?
yeah . moz , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m gonna head home .
ja ne .
ja ne .
work before play , my friend .
two parts .
russian heritage museum
gets invitation only , and they &apos;re sticking to that .
i pulled this from municipal archives .
we can stake out the building .
if fowler shows up , we grab him outside .
all right , listen .
i want neal &apos;s anklet monitored continuously .
you think he &apos;ll try something ?
neal wants fowler more than i do ,
and i can &apos;t let that happen .
are you in place ?
i &apos;ve got eyes on the front entrance .
where &apos;s caffrey ?
he &apos;s at home .
let &apos;s hope the little guy &apos;s there
to keep an eye on him .
how do i look ?
don &apos;t answer that .
you &apos;re inscrutable .
you know that , bugsy ?
they say accessories make the outfit .
you buy it ?
peter , i see fowler .
he &apos;s coming your way .
hello .
nice to see you .
invitation , please ?
fowler just entered the building .
i &apos;m going after him .
stay on the entrance .
invitation , please .
fbi .
i &apos;m investigating that man you just
let in without one .
fowler !
sir ... you can &apos;t go up there .
i am a federal agent .
where do these stairs lead ?
the modernist gallery . it &apos;s closed for renovations .
it &apos;s locked . do you have a key ?
fowler , open up !
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re messing with !
let me try this key .
surrender , fowler , right now !
let it go , burke !
get that thing open .
neal , we &apos;ve had a breakthrough of unforeseen magnitude .
akihiro &apos;s run @-@ on haiku
paired with my rejection of predetermined --
neal ?
neal ?
does june know you &apos;re up here ?
oh , benjamin siegelbaum .
what has he done ?
hello .
suit , we have a code red .
now is not the time , mozzie .
it &apos;s a dark day when i turn towards the system
instead of recoiling .
just spit it out !
remember when you asked me to tell you
if neal was gonna do something stupid ?
well , i regretfully report ...
that he &apos;s out of his anklet .
damn it .
but that &apos;s not the &quot; stupid &quot; part .
he &apos;s got a gun .
neal is manipulating his tracking signal .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s close . he &apos;s armed .
if you see him , pursue .
got it .
neal , what are you doing ?
thank you .
you got a party crasher out front .
yeah .
caffrey got past me .
he &apos;s inside . i &apos;m going after him .
damn it !
go .
is anybody coming ?
caffrey ! neal !
yeah .
he &apos;s upstairs .
stop him .
neal !
neal !
caffrey &apos;s in there .
he &apos;s with fowler .
i have five shots left .
that &apos;s the only warning you get .
whatever you think happ--
tell me why you killed kate !
you bought the explosives .
caffery
you blew up the plane to get rid of us !
no .
what was in it for you ?
jesus , caffrey ,
you think you &apos;re the only one that lost something ?
don &apos;t play with me , fowler .
you think i wanted to spend the last year of my life
chasing you and a stupid box ?
it cost me everything !
my career is over .
my wife is gone .
stay out of this , peter !
neal , put the gun down !
neal , don &apos;t do this !
you know he killed kate .
i didn &apos;t kill her .
who did ?
i &apos;m ...
what do you know ?
tell me what you know !
you want to kill me , neal ?
go ahead and pull the trigger .
jesus , fowler , you &apos;re not helping this .
neal , do not do this .
i know you killed her .
you killed kate .
listen to me .
if you pull that trigger ,
you will regret it for the rest of your life , neal .
you &apos;re not a killer .
i want him to know how it felt .
how she felt .
look at me .
look at me , neal .
neal .
look at me , neal . come on .
this isn &apos;t who you are .
cuff him .
how are we gonna handle this ?
call jones .
you two can handle the official bureau response .
take him back to the office ,
then i &apos;ll figure out what to do next .
did you kill her ?
no .
you &apos;re gonna tell me who did .
i was just like you , burke .
moving up in the bureau .
beautiful wife .
things were good then .
your wife was murdered .
yeah .
did my best to put the pieces back together ,
but all i could think about was vengeance .
then out of the blue one day , i get a phone call ,
anonymous voice ,
pointing me right to her killer .
so i tracked him down .
and you killed him .
a few days later , i get a package in the mail .
it &apos;s a video .
of what you had done .
followed by another phone call .
man tells me he can arrange it for me to be transferred
into opr .
opr ?
yeah .
he had enough clout to make that happen ?
yeah .
is he with the bureau ?
i don &apos;t know .
after that , he told me
if i could get him the music box ,
the video would disappear .
give it to your mystery blackmailer ...
get your life back .
that was our deal .
so i traced the box to caffrey .
but he didn &apos;t have it .
well , everyone thought he did .
but he was in prison .
so you went after kate .
i figured she &apos;d know where you kept it .
you &apos;re the man with the ring .
she was signaling you with her atm card that day , huh ?
yeah .
it worked .
why &apos;d you buy the explosives ?
oh , that was kate &apos;s idea .
look , i set up your getaway ...
as part of mentor .
oh , mentor was real ?
yeah .
kate felt that no matter how far away you two got ,
you would never be safe .
and i don &apos;t think she was wrong .
hey , look ...
i don &apos;t know who the guy is pulling these strings ,
but i have never seen anyone with the kind of juice he has .
so it was her idea to blow up the plane ?
yeah . you two bail out over the water .
fake our death and live happily ever after .
the bomb exploded early . why ?
i don &apos;t know .
she called you from the plane .
we heard it on the cockpit recording .
kate never called me .
your name was listed on the phone .
i &apos;m not that stupid .
boss ?
yeah ?
the marshals reset the key .
put it on him . take him home .
peter , not right now .
go home .
so , what &apos;s gonna happen to me ?
i haven &apos;t decided .
you want to help me ?
the flash drive i got from you the day that i ...
the day you shot me ?
yeah .
it contained the date , time , and place of a meeting .
who were you meeting ?
i had been trying forever
to get to the guy pulling the strings .
i had finally gotten a meeting with the intermediary .
what was the name of the guy you were meeting ?
i don &apos;t know . i was gonna find out that day .
you didn &apos;t know it ?
no .
i was there .
what ?
did you see him ?
no . he was good .
he dodged my cameras .
i never got a clear look at him , but ...
i got this .
you know him ?
yeah .
julian larssen .
we trained together in special forces .
you didn &apos;t know he was involved in this ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen him in years .
that &apos;s our patchwork man .
excuse me .
what &apos;s going on ?
nypd just called in a homicide
in an antique shop downtown .
the same antique shop where neal got his gun .
rule out a snatch and grab ?
two shots to the chest .
as far as we can tell , nothing was taken .
that was playing when we came in .
i &apos;ll check it out .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
shop owner was working on the codes .
turn that off .
let me see that .
&quot; eureka ! &quot;
he must have figured something out .
when you &apos;re done with this , it comes to me .
how about surveillance tapes ?
the gunman was smart . knew to avoid the cameras .
but this is interesting .
surveillance tape was cued up to some earlier footage .
neal .
he &apos;s the next target .
what the hell &apos;s going on ? !
hi , neal .
can i come in ?
sure .
come on in .
neal , pick up !
keep trying .
are you gonna answer that ?
no .
is the target officially off my back ?
whoever wants the box
knows you don &apos;t have it now .
well , it &apos;ll be nice to stop prowling around rooftops
for a paycheck .
what about you ?
did you get what you need ?
i found fowler .
but i still don &apos;t know who killed kate .
and the code ?
moz will crack it .
i chased that music box for a long time , neal .
i almost feel guilty i brought you in .
oh , come on . i forced my way in .
true , but that &apos;s just ...
what we do .
it &apos;s kind of sad .
it &apos;s all coming to an end .
freeze !
hands where i can see them !
