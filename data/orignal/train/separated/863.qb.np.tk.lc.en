this is my mom ,
beverly goldberg , a shoulder @-@ padded ,
country @-@ haired mother warrior
whose top priority was always her kids .
before helicopter moms and attachment parenting ,
she was the original smother .
snuggle bug , circular motions .
we &apos;ve had this discussion . just give it to me .
see ?
feel that difference ? make a bunny face .
she was all over us from early in the morning
to late at night .
who wants a sleepover snack ?
first one to fall asleep gets their bra frozen .
why are you in here ?
she even found a way to smother us at school .
mom ?
don &apos;t mind me .
soccer tryouts are this afternoon .
you need that to protect your special spot .
i know what it &apos;s for . just leave .
but nothing put a bounce in her step
more than planning our futures for us .
oh , this is just so exciting !
so many choices -- how are we ever gonna decide ? !
&quot; we &quot; ? no , i &apos;m deciding .
oh , if it were your decision , you &apos;d go to hawaii university .
uh , whoa , whoa ,
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
they have a college in hawaii ?
how did they get a school on an island ?
oh , my ! i got to check this out !
aloha !
what &apos;s this ?
a prestigious college right in our hometown of philadelphia ?
yeah , there &apos;s no way in hell
i am living at home and going to drexel .
hear you loud and clear .
hello , drexel .
i &apos;m beverly goldberg . this is erica .
i don &apos;t want to build her up too much ,
but she is literally the best student
that ever has been or will be .
uh , besides having a great personality ,
she gets good grades , does meals on wheels ,
model u.n. ,
and is a volunteer swim instructor at the &quot; y. &quot;
for the love of god , stop talking !
you &apos;re parading me around like a poodle , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
honey , i &apos;m your mother .
it is my job to strong @-@ arm people into seeing how amazing you are .
look around .
no other mothers insist on being so involved .
beverly !
but that wasn &apos;t true .
her name was betsy rubenstone ,
the other smother .
she was head of the pta , chair of the fall festival
and eight other parent committees .
my mom volunteered , too ,
but betsy was just made better , stronger , faster .
ah , betsy !
so , what school are you thinking about for carin ?
she &apos;s already been early @-@ accepted to yale .
today &apos;s all about getting a jump @-@ start for michael .
isn &apos;t he a sophomore ?
it &apos;s never too early .
i mean , he only has a 3.8,
so i &apos;m pushing the extracurriculars .
he &apos;s on the debate team ,
tours middle schools with d.a.r.e. ,
and he was just riff in &quot; west side story . &quot;
riff ? that &apos;s -- what ? -- like third lead .
michael &apos;s too busy to be tony .
he &apos;s swamped .
he can &apos;t even be student council treasurer this year ,
even though he always runs unopposed .
betsy and my mom had been at war for years
over whose kids were better .
my little science wiz . isn &apos;t he amazing ?
she built it for him .
betsy was winning .
well , barry &apos;s busy , too . um , he makes up rap songs .
they call him big tasty .
and he does karate
and plays harmonica and basketball .
barry made varsity ?
more like street ball .
he plays in the street and in our driveway ,
which leads ... to the street .
i &apos;m not sure you can put that on a college resume ?
it &apos;s a gray area . oh , you know .
point is , though , he will be going to an ivy league school --
probably not yale &apos; cause i haven &apos;t heard great things .
check it out -- hawaii university !
it &apos;s real , and he said they accept americans !
he &apos;s kidding !
oh , class clown ! kids love him .
sense of humor -- it &apos;s such a commodity in today &apos;s economy .
anyway , bye @-@ bye , now .
what &apos;s the matter ?
you &apos;re not going to school in hawaii .
it &apos;s surrounded by sharks , and even if i did let you go ,
it would be a stretch because you don &apos;t have
a single club on your resume ?
not true .
i &apos;m founding member of the beat @-@ box club .
it &apos;s not official , but that &apos;s by choice
&apos;cause then we &apos;d be sellouts .
listen , i just heard there &apos;s an opening
for school treasurer -- unopposed .
think about it . it &apos;s a guaranteed ...
... wi @-@ in .
so , i do nothing and automatically win ?
yes .
nah .
come on . name your price .
8 bucks , and i get to eat in front of the tv tonight .
deal .
yeah !
i love politics .
back in the &apos; 80s ,
you couldn &apos;t just lay on your couch
and stream a movie to your phone .
you actually had to spend an hour venturing
to a wondrous place called a video store ,
and it was awesome !
let &apos;s just make this fast , okay ?
pick a movie , and don &apos;t go behind the curtain !
the stakes were high .
if someone already rented the movie you wanted ,
you were out of luck .
no ! !
&quot; temple of doom &quot; is checked out !
some putz checked it out !
just pick any movie .
look -- &quot; rhinestone . &quot; rambo sings in it .
does rambo sing while ripping a man &apos;s heart out of his chest ?
doesn &apos;t say .
when you were out of options , there was one last hail mary --
the return bin .
if your movie was in there ,
it was like winning the lottery --
at least for an obsessive movie geek like me .
yes !
i am the luckiest man alive !
yeah , we all have our stories .
let &apos;s just get going . here &apos;s my card .
&quot; temple of doom . &quot; overrated .
you want to see a good film , kid ,
watch bergman &apos;s &quot; the seventh seal &quot;
or &quot; devil &apos;s manners &quot; -- that &apos;s my student film .
it &apos;s pretty much the quintessential --
no , thank you , and let &apos;s get going .
uh , we &apos;re in a big rush .
yeah , you have a movie out .
&quot; slap shot . &quot; overrated .
if you ask , paul newman should not --
i did not ask you , and i know i returned that movie .
please check again .
i didn &apos;t realize that my computer was hal 9000
and it could change at will
and blast us out the pod bay doors .
nothing you say makes any sense .
please check again because i am 100 % positive
that i returned that movie .
you guys lost it .
dad , i just want to watch my movie .
okay , how much do i owe you ?
to restore your account ,
you would have to purchase the unreturned video ...
... which would be $ 59.99 .
that &apos;s crazy ! i &apos;m not paying that !
come on . this is the only video store in town .
it &apos;s not like we have a choice .
we do have a choice !
i am not leaving here
until you clear my account and i get my justice .
what are you doing ?
just marking &quot; temple of doom &quot; as in stock .
let &apos;s get out of here . come on , now , now !
is mom here ?
yeah , she just got home .
damn it !
don &apos;t mind me . just go back to your sandwich .
in that moment ,
pops saw that his sweet , little granddaughter
was actually a master of deception .
there &apos;s my beautiful mermaid . how was swim class ?
little emily goodman finally put her face in the water .
oh , you are an inspiration .
thanks , mom .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
&quot; swim class -- thursday the 27th .
emily goodman -- face in water . &quot;
uh @-@ oh , i &apos;m looking at some pretty shady stuff here ,
and i know shady .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna let you in on a secret that &apos;s so gigantic
that it could rock this family to its very core .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t -- - here it is .
i &apos;ve never taught a swimming lesson in my entire life ,
i don &apos;t do model u.n. or meals on wheels ,
and it feels so good to finally tell someone !
wait . you scammed your mom ?
that &apos;s very risky .
how has she not been at one of your swim lessons ?
i specifically chose the ymca pool
&apos;cause she hates it .
it &apos;s so humid , it makes her hair frizz .
and the model u.n. thingy ?
i swore i &apos;d quit if she showed up ,
and she knows better than to call that bluff .
but how did you get in the yearbook ?
turns out my sister &apos;s desperation
spawned a new invention ...
the photo bomb .
and i thought she was good .
she is , but i &apos;m better .
and i have to be , &apos; cause if she ever finds out ,
she &apos;ll kill us both .
why am i getting killed ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re in on it with me .
since when ? !
since i just told you !
how did this happen ?
i just came here to have a pastrami sandwich !
you better come clean with your mother before she finds out .
or i fake @-@ join the debate club
and create a whole other level of lies !
thanks , pops ! you &apos;re the best !
finally ! there &apos;s my baby .
what &apos;s that weird smell ?
that &apos;s the smell of clean .
you &apos;re free to start reversing the process now .
how was school ?
sweet !
fed a sea gull a french fry .
we &apos;re not near the ocean . how do they get there ?
no , i was talking about student council .
oh , that . yeah .
not happening .
what ? !
michael rubenstone is running now .
you said this was a guaranteed win and i wouldn &apos;t have to try .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m good at .
since when is michael running ?
he &apos;s already got a full plate .
i &apos;m okay with it --
mostly &apos; cause i don &apos;t give a crap .
you can beat michael rubenstone .
i mean , what has he got that my delicious boy doesn &apos;t ?
cookies !
his mom made them ,
and they &apos;re the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy .
oh , so we &apos;re baking political cookies now , huh ?
you wanted war ?
you &apos;ve got it , betsy rubenstone .
that is good !
good morning , guys .
vote for michael . michael for treasurer .
you guys know michael , right ?
betsy rubenstone .
we need to talk .
beverly !
look at you pulling off that outfit for the most part .
cut the chitchat . i &apos;m on to you .
you said michael was too busy to run for treasurer .
well , he found the time
&apos;cause he has a passion for politics .
no , he doesn &apos;t !
all kids hate everything .
he &apos;s only running because you have it out for me .
why don &apos;t i make michael drop out of the race
and give poor barry the win ?
no ! you leave michael in .
i &apos;m barry &apos;s campaign manager now , and we will crush you .
i &apos;d love to see that .
well , good luck .
good luck to you .
don &apos;t need it .
neither do i.
think you do .
think you do .
do you ?
i do .
i don &apos;t .
what ?
just kidding . i don &apos;t .
things were really heating up between my mom and betsy rubenstone ,
while back home my dad was about to lose his cool .
oh , what did you do with the tv guide ?
my father had found the video he swore he had returned .
so he did what any honorable man would do .
hide the evidence .
what you doing ?
nothing .
is that &quot; slap shot &quot; ? !
are you kidding me ? you swore you returned it .
you said you were 100 % positive !
i &apos;ve never been 100 % positive about anything in my life .
whatever !
let &apos;s just end this stupid feud and return the movie .
nope , dad is gonna teach you
a very valuable life lesson here , okay ?
if you never admit you &apos;re wrong ,
you &apos;re never wrong !
either you take that tape back to the video store
or we got real problems , man !
what are you getting at ?
you know what i &apos;m getting at !
i really have no clue .
i don &apos;t either !
just return the tape !
as erica spun her web of lies ,
pops tried to avoid getting caught in it .
pops , pops , thank god . um , i need you to listen
to this fake argument about , uh , trickle @-@ down economics
in case mom asks me about the debate team .
you &apos;re writing speeches for a debate
you &apos;re not a part of ?
yes , and we need to make it good .
no &quot; we . &quot; stop saying &quot; we . &quot;
&quot; trickle @-@ down economics is a pejorative term
used by liberal @-@ media hacks . &quot;
this is crazy !
wouldn &apos;t it just be easier if you actually did this stuff ?
i mean , it would look great on the college resume ?
oh , it would , but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m gonna let you in on another huge secret .
no !
here it is .
this is the opposite of what i want .
back in freshman year when i actually did model u.n. ,
there was ... an incident .
it was my sister &apos;s dark origin story .
back before erica was erica ,
she was an overachieving , first @-@ class stress case !
senegal ? really ?
their main export is the peanut !
if i &apos;m getting a country in africa ,
i &apos;m getting libya !
erica ? !
i am libya !
hey ! i &apos;ve got every country now .
uh @-@ huh , that &apos;s right , patel !
i declare a new world order !
i was such a stress case under so much pressure
from mom , dad , my teachers , everyone .
so that &apos;s when i started hanging out with the popular kids ,
and you know what they do after school ?
nothing . they do nothing !
they &apos;re never stressed @-@ out ,
so i quit all of it .
but aren &apos;t you just as stressed
trying to keep this whole charade alive ?
oh , yeah , it &apos;s way worse !
then just apologize and go back to being a weirdo again .
i can &apos;t do that . they hate me .
kiddo , sometimes you just have to swallow your pride
and ask for forgiveness .
well , what have we here ?
just take the tape , and i no longer owe you $ 59 .
that is correct .
you now owe me ...
... $ 106.75 .
what are you talking about ? that &apos;s crazy .
late fees --
61 days overdue times $ 1.75,
and let &apos;s see .
yes , definitely -- a $ 2 rewind fee .
just give me the movie .
no .
come on . give me the movie .
no .
no !
okay , that &apos;s it . i ban you from video heaven .
oh , no , no , no !
i ban you ! that &apos;s right !
i am never coming in here again ever !
that &apos;s what i said .
and &quot; slap shot &quot; is a great movie .
while my dad was losing his battle ,
my mom was determined not to lose hers .
hi . uh , can i speak to julianne crump , please ?
hello , mrs . stevens . is your daughter kelly there ?
okay , your son kelly . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , you &apos;ve already committed your --
your vote to michael rubenstone ?
okay , what can i do to convince you to vote for barry ?
yes , erica is single .
what the hell is this ?
surprise !
get it ? vote for barry .
barry . berry .
barry .
they sound the same , and you &apos;re both delicious !
mom . kids like cookies !
why don &apos;t you just bake some cookies ? !
because &quot; cookie &quot; doesn &apos;t work with &quot; barry . &quot;
well , this doesn &apos;t work either !
that &apos;s right ! i got berried !
9th grade girls threw them at me .
there &apos;s supposed to be a hierarchy .
they ignored the hierarchy !
i quit .
you can &apos;t quit .
we cannot lose this thing . not now , not ever .
why do you even care so much ?
i don &apos;t care . do i look like i care ?
look how casual i am .
i don &apos;t want to be stupid treasurer .
do you even know what a treasurer does ?
a treasurer is one of the most important jobs a school has .
you get to handle all the money .
so it does involve treasure .
and you get to run the student government
when the president , the vice president ,
and the secretary all get sick .
i want this job . what do we have to do ?
you just keep being delicious .
uh , let your campaign manager deal with all the nitty @-@ gritty .
here &apos;s your speech . memorize it .
okay .
but no more berries !
you have my word .
the next day , there were no berries in sight ,
but barry was everywhere .
投票此 &quot; 才宝 &quot; 让他当选财务部长
have you seen this ? this is so freaking embarrassing .
oh , my god , it &apos;s you .
no , it &apos;s not .
no . no , no , no .
in what universe , in what reality
would you think this is even a little bit okay ?
just look at that delicious face !
that &apos;s a face you want to eat -- and vote for .
fired ! you &apos;re fired as campaign manager !
i have just fired you !
you can &apos;t fire me . i &apos;m your mother .
then i fire you as my mother !
if you fire me as your mother , then i have failed as a mother .
then you &apos;ve failed as a mother .
how dare you say i &apos;ve failed as a mother ?
you know what ? i bet that betsy rubenstone
plastered posters all over the school .
if anyone failed as a mother , it &apos;s probably her somehow .
wait , this was never about me beating michael , was it ?
it was about you beating betsy !
you always complain about her being overbearing and pushy .
you &apos;re way worse .
i was so excited for my dad to get home ,
i could barely enjoy my algebra homework .
what &apos;s in the bag ? tell me it &apos;s &quot; indiana jones . &quot;
even better .
who needs a movie when you &apos;ve got a video @-@ game @-@ machine thing ?
are you joking with me right now ?
this is atari .
i have nintendo .
there &apos;s a difference ?
why are you giving me misguided gifts ?
what happened at the video store ? !
we lost her , son .
she &apos;s gone .
i went in with the best intentions ,
but things were said , and now we &apos;re banned for life .
whose life -- mine or yours ?
the video @-@ store guy wasn &apos;t clear about that .
how could you do this ? !
you know how important movies are to me !
well , i think what we have here is a valuable life lesson .
you know what &apos;s a lesson that i &apos;ve learned ?
never count on my dad to do the right thing .
while i was a casualty of my father &apos;s war ,
my mom was finally gonna wave the white flag .
oh , hi , bev !
love what you &apos;ve done with the hair .
you make such brave choices .
look , i come in peace .
all this bad blood , it -- it &apos;s got to stop .
uh ... barry &apos;s dropping out .
of high school ?
of the election .
so you guys win .
so unexpected .
and yet ... i knew this would happen .
oh , winner !
what ?
oh , no !
oh , my god , that must mean
they really loved the speech i wrote !
yep , i , uh -- i definitely think the speech helped clinch it .
this is for all you out there with overbearing parents
with no sense of shame or boundaries !
now , i don &apos;t know how this exactly ties into being a treasurer .
but i do know if i can survive the berries
and the pictures of me being like this ...
... then i &apos;m definitely the dude to lead this school
&apos;cause all moms suck ! who &apos;s with me ? !
we did it ! we really did it !
i mean , you -- you did it .
this has nothing to do with me .
congrats .
thank you .
good race .
it was .
i know .
do you ?
i do .
drive safely .
i will .
my mom would have some tough competition along the way ,
but beverly goldberg would always be
the original smother .
and erica was finally able to embrace her original self .
hey , i know it &apos;s been a while .
um , i want to say i &apos;m sorry for everything in the past .
but i &apos;d love to be a part of model u.n.
if you &apos;d have me back .
you can sit next to me . pull up a chair .
you want to be the u.s.a. ?
no , no , no , it &apos;s fine .
i was thinking ... senegal ?
as for my dad , he learned there were very few things
worth swallowing his pride for .
but his kid was one of them .
don &apos;t talk . i know i &apos;m wrong .
i know i &apos;m banned . but i &apos;m not here for me .
i &apos;m here for someone who loves movies as much as you do .
here .
it &apos;s a video @-@ store membership .
i &apos;m banned . you &apos;re not .
i &apos;ve prepaid for 50 movies ,
which should last you about a month .
up next , &quot; rhinestone , &quot; starring sylvester stallone .
oh , &quot; rhinestone &quot; !
i hear stallone sings in this one .
is there nothing that man cannot do ?
no ! he &apos;s rambo ! he &apos;s rocky !
he doesn &apos;t do country music .
where &apos;s the remote ?
what the ...
&quot; temple of doom &quot; ? !
didn &apos;t you rent that a couple of months ago ?
oh , balls .
