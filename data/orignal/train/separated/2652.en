Hold up. Hold up.
Something extra.
Thanks. The boys had a blast.
Thanks. They're good kids...
Except yours. I think he needs more sugar.
Bye.
Guys! Get off the street!
All righty, bye, bye, bye!

Hi.
Breakfast is served.
I got, uh, juice, coffee,
apple turnovers from Pan Lourdes,
and, uh, no pancakes.
Okay, great.
Uh, let me help you with that.
I got it. I got it.
You shouldn't be lifting things.
Well, my ribs feel better, so I'm fine.
Well, I'll be the judge of that.
Let me just take a peek at this --
I prefer the bookish teacher.
Well, then you're in luck, because, uh, I got a job --
a real job -- teaching history
at, uh, Shorewood High School in Boston.
Boston? You're gonna move to --
We're gonna move to Boston.
I know -- I know you need, uh, time
to think about everything, and I get that,
but what happened to you was terrifying.
Okay?
It was like a giant flashing sign from God
that you need to start over somewhere else.
If you don't want to do it for us,
then do it...for our kid.
Our -- our kid?
Come here, buddy!
Hey, there he is, Hudson!
I-I hate to break up this family reunion,
but I got to go.
I got to check out the campus in, uh, Boston.
So I'll clean this up before I go.
Okay.
A teacher?
There was a lot about our old life that I really liked...
including you.
Wait, wait.
Oh, yes.
Be safe.
Edward Weston was an associate of mine.
His murder remains unsolved --
the cause of his burns, a mystery...
until now.
William Dowd, found under the 14th street bridge this morning
sprinkled with burning lead.
Uh, the marks and use of lead
are consistent with a medieval device subtly called...
a lead sprinkler.
The device is used to shower victims with molten lead,
or in the case of Mr. Dowd,
to pour it into his mouth,
causing serious inner burns and eventual death.
We boring you, Donald?
Where's Keen?
You wouldn't be here without her if she was okay.
She's recovering nicely.
That's a relief.
I'm sure it is.
You confiscated her firearm.
Oh, so you think a convicted felon
should be allowed to carry guns.
All the ones I know do.
I see you've started without me.
You should be recuperating.
Take whatever time you need.
I appreciate that,
and the cards and flowers and trashy novels --
especially the trashy novels, Aram.
Thank you.
But I am good.
Don't let me interrupt.
What's the case?
The Holy Vehm --
a vigilante group that operated in the Germanic regions of Europe
during the middle ages.
The Vehmic Court was sanctioned by the emperor
and directed by the archbishop to punish sinners.
What sins did these two commit?
Well, in the 15th century,
the Vehm meted out justice for heresy and witchcraft.
But today, who knows?
During the height of their power,
they killed thousands.
If I'm correct and the Vehm has been resurrected,
there's no telling how many victims you'll be looking at.
Aram, see what cold cases you can find
with even a remotely similar M.O.
Ressler, Navabi, find Dowd's wife.
See what she knows.
What is that?
Some kind of metal?
It's lead.
You should be resting.
I'll have Aram order an analysis,
see if we can trace that lead to a supplier.
I've got agents working double time
to find the perps who attacked her.
That won't be necessary.
Here. Careful, it's loaded.
I'm pregnant.
Yes.
I've known for some time.
How?
Everything.
Your body, your skin, a look in your eyes,
different tastes for different foods,
nausea, distracted, moody.
Yes.
With everything that was happening, I just...
I mean, I guess I knew,
but I just couldn't.
I bought a pregnancy test three weeks ago,
and I threw it out before I took it.
I mean, I-I was okay facing the Cabal,
but those two red lines --
I just...
could not handle that.
I assume Tom is the father.
I haven't told him.
He's still figuring his life out.
There's a job in Boston.
I know you want to believe that our work is done,
but it's not.
The addition of a child will make that...
infinitely more difficult.
What they did to him. Who would do such a thing?
Does your husband have any enemies?
Any problems at work?
None.
William was a kind man and a great father.
He was involved in the community.
When our daughter was in school...
How many kids do you have?
One. Amy.
There was something she's not telling us.
20 pictures on their fridge and not one of their daughter?
You think something happened between them?
We need to find her, see if she agrees
with the wife about his parenting skills.
I'm guessing the answer's no.
Father, forgive me, for I have sinned.
It's been a week since my last confession.
Since that time, I have killed two men.
Well done, my son,
for you are the tip of his spear.
Through your hands, his judgment is witnessed.
Let us pray. Our father...
We've linked the Vehm's M.O. to a dozen murders.
Each victim was subjected to some form of medieval torture.
Sam Archer was whipped until an artery burst
and he bled to death.
The bruising, fractures, and deep puncture wounds
indicate that Joseph Gibson's extremities were crushed
with some device called "The Spanish Boot."
None of the victims had a record.
Why were they targeted?
We are not sure.
We're still going over case files.
Sir.
From your wife.
Those are beautiful.
My office.
What else do we know?
They did find William Dowd's daughter
living as Lisa Neil -- new name, new social.
She's definitely hiding from something.
Or someone. We're on it.
Is this a bad time?
I thought you'd rolled out.
That's actually why I'm here.
Ressler and I -- are we partners?
Would that be a problem?
He did fire me.
Yes. An appropriate action given the circumstances,
but one he deeply regrets
and went to great lengths to rectify.
He did.
In a status report submitted to me
after I returned he was quite eloquent
about your value to the task force.
You're welcome to read it after you question Lisa Neil.
It's hard to forgive sometimes.
Lisa Neil.
Yes, is this Dr. Meyer's office?
I have an appointment next week for my son.
I think he's a threat to himself.
It's urgent that we see the doctor today.
Lisa Neil?
Can I help you?
I'm Agent Navabi, FBI.
This is Agent Ressler.
We have some questions for you about your father.
My father died years ago.
You, uh, must be confusing me with somebody else.
Someone like Amy Dowd?
Hello?
Someone there?
There was no one out front.
My secretary leaves at 5:00.
You must be Mr. Harris.
Yes.
Where's your son?
I was told the appointment is for him.
Oh, it should be, but, you know,
my wife doesn't really believe in therapy.
You know, she thinks people like you do more harm than good.
Do you, Dr. Meyer?
I-I don't believe so.
Why don't you come in.
Tell me what's going on with your son.
My father was murdered?
Yes.
By people who thought he had, uh, sinned.
It might help us find his killer
if we knew whether that was true or not.
Was it?
Yeah.
That's why I ran away.
So can I ask how you treat the children?
You know, how it all works.
Well, it's important for me to get a sense of the child,
so the first few sessions would be one-on-one.
Without a parent present?
For me to gain their trust, it's best to start out that way.
I was 12.
I came home from swimming at my friend's house,
and I went into the basement to put my suit in the dryer,
and he was there.
Your father.
And someone else.
A boy.
When you're alone with my son, would you be touching him?
Absolutely not.
I'm not even sure I understand your question.
I mean, would you think about touching him?
I'm sorry your son is having a hard time,
but I think you should leave.
Oh...no! No!
You hurt children.
What are you doing?
No!
You earn their trust
and then you abuse them.
They said I was crazy.
That I was making it all up.
That my father never raped that little boy.
But I know the truth.
My father was a monster.
Whoever killed him did the world a favor.
Sooner or later,
No!
we all pay for our sins.
What are you doing?
What is this?!
What are you doing?!
I paid for mine...
What are you talking about!?
...and it's time you paid for yours.
Oh, we meet again. You must be the new neighbor.
I'm Zoe.
Liz.
Who's this?
Stanley.
Hi, Stanley!
Hi, Stanley.
He's so cute!
Don't let that fool you. He's the devil child.
He hasn't slept the night through since ever.
Well, we can stay up together.
I'm expecting a little devil of my own.
Oh, really? That's amazing.
I mean, besides no sleep, no sex,
and stretch marks the size of Kansas,
there are really great things about it.
I can't think of any, but that's what people say.
Look, I'm sure you have a thousand questions.
I'm here, anytime. I'm here all the time.
That's very nice of you.
I'll probably take you up on that. Thanks.
I thought you were going to Boston.
Rescheduled for tomorrow.
Felt like hanging out.
What's that?
Something I've kept in my wallet
since the day you gave it to me.
Is that...
A hope. A wish.
The child that we were gonna adopt, and that, I hope...
is the one we're gonna have.
You found my pro/con list. - Pro --
Chance for a normal life, family,
doting husband with rock-hard abs.
Really?
Liz...we're pregnant.
Yeah.
We are.
But before you get too excited --
It's way too late for that.
I'm thinking about giving the baby up for adoption.
Why? Why?
Why would you do that?
Maybe you should take another look at the list.
I mean, there are only three pros
and, maybe, I can probably think of a hundred cons.
I'm a felon.
People hate me. I'm a pariah.
Here, in D.C. That is why we have to move.
And the rest?
Dangerous job -- fixable.
Unmarried -- totally fixable.
Uh, unmarried was never a part of my list.
Well, a guy can dream.
Can't he?
Yeah. Yeah, they're -- they're all fixable, Tom,
except for one --
Reddington.
We can get away from him.
His life, my life,
is so filled with violence and...
anger and hatred and death.
How can I bring a child into that world?
My world.
Our world, Liz.
Not his. Ours.
This is why I didn't want to tell you.
I knew you'd be so annoyingly positive.
What, you don't want to be positive?
I don't want to be naive!
Just promise me that you'll keep an open mind. All right?
About Boston and us and...
the little one.
What?
I'm pretty sure I put question marks next to your name.
Did you?
Yeah.
That's weird, 'cause it looks like you changed your mind.
Oh, my God.
I'm a violent man.
I've taken on a life that requires it.
I hurt people.
I kill people.
And each time I do, in that moment,
another part of me dies along with them.
When I was young,
I romanticized the life of an outlaw...
bad guys.
That was a long time ago.
Raymond.
Yes.
The Vehm are hunting pedophiles.
William Dowd's daughter confirmed
that's what her father was.
You just won't rest, will you?
I'm pregnant, not sick.
Besides, you're the one who said
there's a fight coming that can't be avoided.
Tell me about the other victims.
They were never charged with any crimes,
but hidden in their backgrounds are whispered accusations --
Incidents that were swept under the rug.
So your theory is that
someone has reorganized a 15th-century cult
to hunt and kill pedophiles.
It fits the fact pattern.
Not all of them.
My associate, Mr. Weston,
the man who started us down this road,
was many things, but a pedophile was not one of them.
I saw his dark side, and it did not involve children.
What did it involve?
Maybe that's where we should look.
You're right.
Of course.
What?
Of course what?
Thank you, Lizzy.
You attacked a pregnant woman,
broke three of her ribs,
battered her so badly she was left lying unconscious
in a grocery-store parking lot.
Call Mr. Kaplan from the car.
We need to find Gerald Sullivan.
So, uh, our metallurgist broke down the lead
that was found on William Dowd.
A specific dye was added to deepen the gray scale.
Was it traceable?
To an online company.
They made many sales, but only one stands out --
the St. James Shelter.
It's a halfway house for ex-cons in Philadelphia.
They use the lead to make religious jewelry.
Could be a location for the Vehm.
Ressler and I will check it out.
Right.
You and Ressler.
I know. It's strange.
But he got me my job back.
Did he?
In the status report he submitted to Cooper,
he lobbied for me.
He didn't have to, and he did.
Well, I can't imagine it was difficult to write nice things.
I'm glad he did. Someone needed to.
Where'd everybody go?
Holy...
Damn it.
Navabi!
Hey, Navabi!
You okay?
Yes. Thank you for asking.
Ressler's running his prints.
Should have an I.D. soon.
He's a zealot, like my brother.
A true believer who twists the Gospel
to justify murder.
I don't need to know his name to know who he is.
The files you found at St. James
contain detailed accounts of the victims.
The research they did was extensive.
They found details local cops clearly missed.
M.E. finished the autopsies
on the three Vehm found at the scene.
Says he's ready for a show-and-tell.
Seemed pretty excited about it.
Okay. Okay, okay -- yes.
I admit, three fully shaved dudes is kind of weird.
It's not something you see every day, but then...
Well, then there's something that you almost...never see.
You've never seen a eunuch?
W-well, no. I...
I've seen a eunuch before.
In fact, I've seen more eunuchs than I care to admit.
Are they all eunuchs?
Sliced and diced. But the beauty part --
and I use that term advisedly, of course --
is that it's self-inflicted.
He did this to himself?
They all did.
Yeah?
Prints came back.
The guy's name is Harlan Holt.
He served seven years at Cumberland for, uh --
get this -- sexual assault of a minor.
So he's a pedophile.
Who got early release by agreeing to castration
to mitigate his deviant desires.
The Vehm at the morgue are castrated as well.
So the Vehm are pedophiles,
and their victims are pedophiles.
It's monsters hunting monsters.
Let's talk about Bobby Sanders. He was 12.
You were his teacher. He trusted you,
And then you exploited that trust.
We know who you are, Mr. Holt.
My brothers and I are defenders of the innocent.
We subjected ourselves to mutilation
in order to cleanse impure thoughts,
allowing us to embody God's will on earth.
We are the protectors of the children.
Well, we got the case files that you kept on your victims.
You should tell us about them, these sinners.
William Dowd.
Hid behind the make-up of a clown.
Always chose the weakest child,
the one who was too scared to tell.
What about Arthur Shepherd?
A counselor for children with special needs.
The system did nothing despite an eyewitness.
What do you mean, did nothing?
Was the case thrown out?
No charges were ever filed.
There's no justice in your justice system.
So we provide it.
An eyewitness to the abuse of a child with special needs,
and no charges were filed? That makes no sense.
Case file on Shepherd includes the eyewitness account.
How do they have case files? They're not cops.
Where did they get them? Who did they get them from?
Who took the eyewitness statement?
A.D.A. in Baltimore -- Peter Levy.
We need to call him,
see if it ever happened.
I doubt it did.
Where are you going with this?
The Vehm are zealots.
They'll kill anyone they're told is a pedophile.
What if someone's telling them
people are pedophiles that aren't?
Reddington says his friend wasn't.
What if the person bringing these case reports
is someone with their own agenda
and they're using the Vehm to carry it out?
My, God.
Gerald, burying your business
in the dirt like a dog.
How the mighty have fallen.
What the hell is this?
A terrible time of year to go camping,
but I suppose we do what we must
when we're on the run.
Brenda and I were just catching up.
She's not hungry, but I noticed
you packed some bratwurst and couldn't resist.
I do love a good cookout.
Red... it's not what you think.
I think you had Weston killed,
and Locke, Bosker, Hundly.
Someone is clearing the playing field, Gerald,
and my money is on you.
Locke and Bosker?
They laundered for the cartels.
Hundly cleaned cash for the sex trade.
I handled white-collar crime.
I know how the market was divided.
In fact,
I was impressed by how well you co-existed
with your competitors -- until now.
You got greedy, Gerald.
I'm not on the run because I killed my competitors.
I'm on the run because I don't want to be killed
by the people who did.
Red, you know me. You know Brenda.
You really think we'd be living in the Bentley
if we didn't have to?
If you're not controlling the Vehm, then who is?
I'm a dead man if I say.
I came here for one thing,
but I've decided I'm gonna leave with two.
The first is the name of the person who controls the Vehm.
And the second?
A song, Gerald.
I so wanted to be a scout --
tying knots, the pinewood Derby,
and the campfire songs.
Oh, those songs.
I keep trying to explain to Dembe,
but I'm no singer.
Just one song!
♬Michael, row your boat ashore.♬
Yes!
♬Hallelujah♬
♬Michael, row the boat ashore.♬
Right?
♬Hallelujah♬
♬Sister, help to trim the sails.♬
♬Hallelujah♬
♬Sister, help to trim the sails.♬
That's enough.
Okay, then.
Just the name.
That's impossible.
That file. Your file --
It says the eyewitness in the Shepherd case
gave his statement to a Baltimore A.D.A.
by the name of Peter Levy.
We called the Baltimore District Attorney.
There is no Peter Levy.
Once we found out that case was false,
we...looked at the others.
Jared Locke's victim?
Well, he doesn't exist.
You were given a screen grab of a model
from a children's clothing website.
You killed William Bosker for molesting his nephew
in Akron Ohio on June 23rd?
Well, the State Department said
that he was living in London at the time.
You're being manipulated.
We need you to tell us by who.
That's a trust...
I can't betray.
He's betrayed yours.
Why don't you tell us before someone else is murdered?
You don't understand. It's too late.
What do you mean? Too late?
We received a new file yesterday.
There's a benefit at Cleveland High School tonight.
Okay, you need to tell me who the target is.
Think back, Harlan. Think hard.
I need a name.
James Wagner.
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Who gave you these files?
Stop me if you've heard this one.
A priest, a eunuch, and a pedophile
walk into a bar...
Excuse me?
Who are you? What are you doing here?
I'm here to offer you the sacrament of confession.
I'll be your father confessor.
I know, the hypocrisy is staggering.
This is James Wagner.
We have reason to believe
that there's an imminent threat on his life.
The principal is gonna speak first.
He's gonna talk about your charitable donations
and the scholarship program before the big announcement
that the auditorium is being named in your honor.
I need a smoke. I'll be back in five.
I don't think you're supposed to smoke on a school campus.
Oh, what are they gonna do, suspend me?
You know what my problem with religion is?
Man.
Like anything that has a potential to be beautiful,
man will turn it into something ugly.
For every saint, there are two million sinners.
Which are you?
Like you, I'm a sinner --
An envious one, I might add,
as my transgressions are not nearly as divine
as the ones you've been guilty of
during the years you've been associated
with the Vatican Bank.
I'm afraid you were misinformed.
I did work with the bank to bring an end
to an unfortunate era of waste and corruption.
Generally speaking,
I'm not a huge fan of the incorruptible,
but your new pontiff?
He is not your father's holy father.
He has an undeniable decency, which you sorely lack.
Yes. At his instruction,
you helped to root out corruption.
So that the Vatican Bank
would no longer be in the money-laundering business,
but to paraphrase Aristotle, corruption abhors a vacuum.
So you moved right in.
You and your little band of eunuchs.
Kudos on that, by the way.
Gathering sick men,
tricking them into thinking they're killing pedophiles
when, in fact, they're killing money launderers
whose business you covet?
The Vehm cleanse the world of God's mistakes.
Their other targets are necessary sacrifices
for the good of the holy church.
No sin in murder or money laundering,
so long as it serves our father here on earth...
or you.
Donald Ressler, FBI.
I understand you're James Wagner's assistant.
I am. I-is something wrong?
I need to see him right now.
He stepped out.
Call him.
He has me hold his phone.
He says it messes up the lines in his suit.
I have nothing to confess to you.
Oh, that.
I wasn't really interested in hearing it.
Although I suppose life in the abbey
must be full of intrigue.
What I am interested in is a proposition.
Care to hear it?
You have a job for the Vehm?
I do. One that should appeal to you.
It's a money launderer --
A formidable player who presents a significant obstacle
to anyone interested in clearing the playing field.
Who is it?
Contact the Vehm. Tell them to meet us here.
I'll explain everything then. Not before.
They're busy.
The FBI raided their chamber of horrors --
killed one, captured some others.
They'll talk.
And when they do, they'll talk about you.
So, my proposition is this.
Do what I'm asking, do it now,
and I'll make sure you go someplace quiet
where the FBI will never find you.
Up here! Around the corner!
What happened?
I-I I don't know. I don't know.
We heard some kind of fight,
but when we got here, he was alone.
Reddington?
Ladies!
What a pleasant surprise.
Especially you, Agent Keen.
I didn't expect to see you in the field.
Well, I am a... a consultant.
I came to consult with Cardinal Richards.
Are you drinking communion wine?
Yes. God, it's god-awful.
If they'd only switch to a good burgundy,
people would be much more devout.
Where is the Cardinal?
Meeting with congregants.
Something about church finances.
What, you're arresting me for smoking?
Smoking on school grounds is a Public Health Law violation.
I was attacked.
We're searching for the people who assaulted you.
Exactly. Yes, those nutjobs assaulted me.
I'm the victim.
Today you are.
But the people who victimized you?
Those nutjobs? They go after two types of people --
Pedophiles and money launderers.
I am not a pedophile!
Then maybe you launder money.
But thanks to you lighting up,
I can hold you until we find out.
Watch your head, pal.
The Vehm are the congregants the Cardinal is meeting with.
Do they know he deceived them?
Yes.
I've done business with a few of the people
they were tricked into killing.
So it was easy enough to provide the details necessary
to show them they'd been terribly misled.
Where did they take him?
I have no idea.
They're gonna kill him.
Probably.
Hell hath no fury like a fundamentalist scorned.
女人受轻慢而生的怒火 比地狱里的还可怕
How did you contact the Vehm?
The Cardinal did it for me.
He was quite excited about it, actually.
In exchange for the promise to keep the FBI from finding him,
he agreed to sic the Vehm on one last money launderer.
I omitted the fact that the cleaner
he was inviting the Vehm to kill was, in fact, himself.
The Cardinal took out the others in order to expand his business.
Did you take him out to expand yours?
Yes.
To raise capital in preparation for war.
What war?
Ours.
Holt just gave us a detailed list
of every member of the Vehm.
So it'll just be a matter of time
before we have them all in custody.
Anything on Cardinal Richards?
Nothing yet, but Main Justice has confirmed
that he used various charities
to launder profits from offshore gambling, so...
All in all, I'd say it was a pretty good day.
Liz, could you give us a second?
Yeah, of course.
Listen, I know I've been prickly with you, and I'm sorry.
I read what you wrote about me in the status report,
and I just wanted to thank you.
I didn't write about you in the status report.
The report you submitted to Cooper.
You lobbied to get my job back.
I don't know who told you that,
but, uh, I didn't lobby Cooper to get your job back,
because I didn't believe that you should've gotten it back.
I see.
I mean, look, it's nothing personal,
but with Reddington being such a wild card,
the rest of us need to know where we stand.
I'm not so sure I know with you.
Okay, well, it's nothing personal,
but...you sucked in bed.
So, how'd it go?
The job fell through.
I don't understand. I thought you already had it.
I did.
Reddington.
It doesn't matter. I'll figure something else out.
Which he'll find out about and then sabotage,
especially if it means me going away.
I know you think I'm overreacting,
but I just want to know that my kid...
Our kid.
I want to know my kid is protected.
He or she will be... Liz, by me.
By us.
Look, I have something else lined up, all right?
It's just gonna take me some time to get it going.
I do have some say in whether or not
we put our child up for adoption.
If what I'm gonna try falls through,
if Reddington interferes, then maybe you're right.
Maybe I'll be okay with it, but I'm not...
right now.
I'll be back tomorrow. Can we talk about it then?
Sure.
I wish you didn't have to go home to that empty apartment.
I don't know. I'm kind of into empty.
I get to...
Take my time.
Fill it with what I want.
Make it my own.
A new start.
Okay. You ready?
Yeah.
What are we gonna do with you today?
What are you doing here?
I missed you.
Yeah, I, uh, dyed my hair to hide.
I don't need to hide anymore.
Lizzy, I misspoke earlier...
about your child.
I said that having it would be...
inconvenient.
You got me a couch.
When your mother was pregnant with you,
it was terribly inconvenient.
The cold war was ending.
Our country was... falling apart.
Everything she had ever known...
She dreaded having a child.
Almost aborted it.
Not one day of her pregnancy
did she ever think of you as anything but a curse.
And then, from the second you were born...
there was never a day when she...
thought you were anything but a blessing.
In my experience,
there is never a convenient time to have a child.
It certainly isn't a convenient time for you.
But if in saying that,
I left you with the impression
that I didn't think you should have your baby,
I'm sorry for that,
because nothing could be further from the truth.
Tom.
What I did was for your protection.
Taking his job away.
I'm not a threat to your safety, Lizzy, or your child's.
On the contrary, I can guarantee it,
but I cannot do that if you run away.
You're the only reason I need protection.
I wish it were that simple.
I think you should leave.
Yeah.
Oh, I should probably mention,
I booked a pregnancy massage for you.
She'll be here at 9:00.
Her name's Edwina, she's a registered nurse,
and she smells absolutely divine.
I hope it goes with the rest of your stuff.
I'm told it pulls out.
Thank you, Aram.
You're welcome.
Uh, what...for, exactly?
I know it was you who wrote about me in Ressler's report.
That.
Too many gerunds?
He didn't even know.
What did you do, hack into his computer?
Look, I know it was the wrong thing to do,
but this task force needs you.
I don't deserve a friend like you.
Maybe not.
You have one.
Cardinal Richards. They found him.
♬You know you didn't understand me♬
Oh, uh, sir, I didn't-- I didn't know that--
♬I didn't say it was a problem♬
It's okay, Aram. It's fine.
Are you, uh...
are you sleeping here?
Charlene and I have separated.
I'm looking for a place.
Until I find one...
♬Before you start to make assumptions♬
I am so sorry.
Yeah.
I am too.
♬Let's try to cut to the solution♬
Want a drink?
Yeah, I don't...
But I do have some limeade in the fridge downstairs,
along with these cherry turnovers
that Agent Keen brought in that are...
amazing.
Sharing one?
♬You can't just throw it in the trailer♬
Sure, why not?
And Aram...
Yeah.
If you could keep this between us.
Of course.
Women.
Zoe, it's your neighbor, Liz.
Could use some company.
Where's Zoe?
Reddington moved her out.
Got her a bigger apartment.
Why?
For your security.
We'll keep a man in this apartment 24 hours a day.
Anybody who wants to get you will have to come past us.
Nice hair.
Hello, my name is Elizabeth Keen.
I'm calling about my pregnancy. My child.
I-if you could please call me at 202-555-0143.
It's about... an adoption.
Giving up my child.
