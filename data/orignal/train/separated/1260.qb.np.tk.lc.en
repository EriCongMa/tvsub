伊芙 · 帕克医生
rod !
eve ?
no !
jane , stop playing with the doughnuts and help .
枪伤及爆炸伤研讨会
i &apos;m not playing .
this is playing .
i still don &apos;t get why you agreed to host this thing ...
and why they don &apos;t bring their own clothes .
well , the convention center doubled their rate
after last year &apos;s ... issue .
what issue ?
she left a severed head in the hotel fridge .
dominick , delivering the bread again .
ugh , i can &apos;t find a new delivery guy .
oh . i don &apos;t mind .
it &apos;s nice to get out from behind the counter .
jane , you remember dominick .
yes ! how are you ?
good . it &apos;s nice to see you , jane .
good to see you .
you , um , you used to love fresh ciabatta rolls .
oh , yeah ! yeah ! bianchi &apos;s bakery !
oh , i haven &apos;t been there in years .
maura , you got to try one of these .
white flour only uses the endosperm .
it &apos;s awful to eat with you .
dominick , whenever you get backed up ,
i &apos;m more than willing to swing by
and pick up my order ...
in my new car .
what ? since when ?
since i became
can &apos;o espress &apos;o&apos;s salesperson of the month .
a crappy canned coffee gave you a car ?
a camry .
she &apos;s beautiful . wait till you see her .
is he with the band ?
hello , dr. pike . it &apos;s nice to see you .
detective rizzoli , you look stunning .
stunning ? thank you .
oh , hello , dr. isles .
hello , dr. pike .
you brought quite a few things .
well , when you &apos;re a cutting @-@ edge forensic scientist ,
you have an obligation to share that knowledge
with your less @-@ skilled colleagues .
the colleagues that can &apos;t tell the difference
between a .38- and a .45 @-@ caliber bullet ?
oh , look ! more cutting @-@ edge forensic scientists .
hello . i am delighted to welcome you all
to the annual bullet and blast injuries symposium .
well , this is real nice of you , dr. isles .
of course . nice to see you again .
i look forward to your powerpoint presentation
on the pathophysiology of blast injuries .
hey , girl ! um ...
me ? he called me a girl ?
can i help you ?
yeah , take this . goes in the freezer .
when i need , you bring .
oh , not again !
what ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i guess my phone number is close to some guy &apos;s wife &apos;s number .
i keep getting all these weird texts ,
like , &quot; hon , pick up my dry cleaning .
&quot; hon , i think we &apos;re out of milk . &quot;
dr. isles , i specifically requested
a special meal --
steel @-@ cut oats with dried @-@ fruit topping .
this better be a murder . mm .
it is ! come on .
excuse me !
have a doughnut . no endosperm .
double homicide .
looks like a .38 .
who are the victims ?
husband and wife shrinks . no sign of forced entry .
no surveillance cameras inside or outside the building .
that &apos;s bad .
what , you think we &apos;re looking for a patient ?
maybe . frost is talking to the office manager .
w--
dr. eve parker ?
what the dr. eve ?
media &apos;s gonna have a field day with this .
why ? who &apos;s she ?
someone who hated children .
jane , that &apos;s not true .
really ? she wrote &quot; no womb for children . &quot;
she advocates childless marriages .
ma used to listen to her radio program
when she was mad at us .
well , i am only familiar with the work of her husband ,
dr. rod parker .
yeah , did he hate kids , too ?
he was an expert in delusional disorders .
soot on the clothing .
stippling on the skin .
yeah , his was a close @-@ contact through @-@ and @-@ through .
hers was from maybe three feet away .
look at the way the bodies are positioned .
she &apos;s on her way out to the bathroom ,
which suggests our shooter was lying in wait .
maybe the husband was talking to the shooter ,
and she surprises them ?
maybe .
or she comes out first ,
he hears the gun go off , runs out .
what what we need to know is ,
were they both targets or just one of them ?
office manager found the bodies when she came in at 7 : 00 a.m ..
did you get a patient list from her ?
no . i got a search warrant going .
she gave me yesterday &apos;s patient sign @-@ in sheet , though .
okay , so , dr. eve &apos;s last patient was at 5 : 00,
dr. rod &apos;s at 6 : 00 .
what , patients only sign in with their initials ?
it &apos;s a privacy issue .
well , thank you , doctor .
i had no idea grandly deluded
people wanted privacy .
hey , maura , you got your tweezers ?
mm @-@ hmm . look .
it &apos;s a piece of latex from the shooter &apos;s glove .
latex has many uses --
balloons , pencil erasers , spandex .
okay , i &apos;m going to guess
that the shooter wasn &apos;t wearing spandex
or carrying balloons .
i hope it &apos;s enough to recover a partial print .
a single bullet penetrated the left ventricle .
that size hole says
it &apos;s in the 0.38 @-@ caliber family .
oh , bullets have families in texas ,
do they ?
it was obviously a .45 .
female victim also died from a .45 .
i &apos;m thinking
we got a different horse galloping here .
oh , really ? a morab ?
a mustang ?
well , you &apos;re saying the bullet that made that hole
is a draft horse ,
and i &apos;m saying it &apos;s more like a shetland pony .
this is waste of time .
i &apos;m sorry ?
it &apos;s classic murder @-@ suicide .
but both victims died instantly ,
and the gun wasn &apos;t recovered .
it &apos;s so obvious . kindergartner would know .
husband shoots wife ,
then shoots his chest ,
just has enough time to toss the gun out in the window .
it &apos;s like chicken whose head cut off .
dr. popov , human beings don &apos;t move
once the cerebral cortex has been s--
i think you &apos;re wasting your breath .
this guy don &apos;t know his butt from a hole in the ground .
i &apos;d like to take this opportunity
to unveil the most significant new development
in the forensic world .
the particle @-@ vac !
dr. pike , please turn that thing off .
capable of fully adjustable suction
up to 50 kilopascals .
step aside , please .
please turn that off !
we are here to advance each other &apos;s knowledge
of gunshot wounds !
whoa ! now look what you &apos;ve done !
i &apos;m gonna have to bill you for that .
crime lab is working on that piece of latex .
maybe we &apos;ll get lucky , get a partial print .
dr. eve had a huge web presence .
she just released her newest book .
&quot; no need to breed . &quot;
here she is promoting the book .
you can choose not to be a mother .
you do not have to breed .
judge allen denied our request
for patient files and phone records .
he won &apos;t even allow us to get a list of names .
now what are we gonna do ?
we &apos;ll go see allen in his chambers .
okay .
dr. eve had a book signing at the literate mind bookstore
a few hours before she was murdered .
that &apos;s interesting .
so is this .
dr. eve had a lot of haters .
here &apos;s a blogger with a big following --
valerie miller .
&quot; waak &quot; --
&quot; wives are about kids . &quot;
looks like she &apos;s aiming a rifle at our victim .
&quot; this fiend hates your child &quot; ?
this from a mother of nine ?
she &apos;s sure plugged in to social media
for someone who homeschools all those kids .
check out her timeline .
translation , please ?
oh , she leads such a fascinating life ,
she wants everyone to know what she &apos;s doing at all times .
where was &quot; mrs. waak &quot; yesterday ?
the literate mind bookstore ,
where dr. eve had the book signing .
where was she last night ?
don &apos;t know . she stopped checking in .
well , i don &apos;t think &quot; mrs. waak &quot;
was getting a signed copy of &quot; no need to breed . &quot;
don &apos;t you feel a little funny driving us ?
why would i feel funny ?
it &apos;s the nicest car i ever had .
come on .
let &apos;s get these groceries inside ,
and i &apos;ll take you for a spin .
oh , i @-@ i can &apos;t right now .
they just gave it to you ?
i have to do a little promotion .
it &apos;s voice @-@ activated .
can &apos;o espress &apos;o added the loudspeaker .
can you hear me ?
uh , yeah , ma .
come see !
it has voice @-@ activated bing search capabilities .
cool !
frankie , you look so handsome in your uniform .
oh , my god . ma , stop !
why ? am i embarrassing you --
oh , my god ! somebody hit my car !
my brand @-@ new car !
what the ...
well , i didn &apos;t hit it very hard , did i ?
oh , yeah , good . it &apos;s just a little dent .
a little dent ? it &apos;s a brand @-@ new car !
ma , take the headset off .
uh , i @-@ i ...
shoot ! i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll get it fixed .
oh , you bet you will !
don &apos;t you look where you &apos;re driving ? !
can i just give you cash ?
i mean , is , um , $ 30 enough ?
are you kidding me ? !
frankie , tell me she &apos;s kidding me .
let -- let me help you with that .
ma !
what ?
come on .
u @-@ um , how pregnant are you ?
seven months .
all right , all right . don &apos;t cry .
we-- we &apos;ll call your husband .
fiance--ex .
he dumped me .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
uh , here .
that &apos;s a lot of unpaid parking tickets .
thank you .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
you &apos;re gonna boot my car
if i don &apos;t sign up for a payment plan .
there isn &apos;t really a payment plan .
then what am i gonna do ?
i lost my job . my roommate kicked me out .
i live in my car .
lydia ?
yeah .
oh , my god . you &apos;re sure ?
lydia @-@ lydia ?
dad &apos;s fiancee , lydia ?
yeah , i saw her name on the parking notices --
lydia sparks .
and you &apos;re sure she &apos;s pregnant ?
she &apos;s out to here .
well , what do we do ? !
how the hell should i know ?
well , should we call pop ?
no , she says he dumped her .
do we just not know him , or is he having some
deranged , late midlife crisis ?
janie , she &apos;s living out of her car .
what if that &apos;s our ... ?
our brother or sister ?
oh , my god .
uh , isn &apos;t there someone the children can stay with
while we talk ?
maybe an older sibling ?
my children are very well @-@ behaved .
yeah .
take a look at that .
you didn &apos;t like dr. eve much , did you ?
not even a little bit .
that &apos;s a pretty violent image .
i thought it made my point in a very visceral way .
so did shooting her . that made your point , too .
she &apos;s a despicable person .
i don &apos;t even want to share gender
by calling her a woman .
but i wouldn &apos;t stoop to killing her .
hey ! finger out of your nose .
do you have children , detective ?
i do not .
it figures .
how does it figure ?
your waist .
even you would have trouble
finding a flattering bathing suit after nine children .
luckily , that &apos;s the only downside .
is that why you shot dr. eve ?
she didn &apos;t have stretch marks ?
oh , i &apos;m very proud of my womb .
oh , please don &apos;t show me your womb , mrs. miller .
okay , where were you last night ?
with my children
and 20 other mothers and their children
at my &quot; wives are about kids &quot; meeting .
it &apos;s already on youtube .
would you like to see ?
what makes you think that coming here in person
will make me change my mind , detectives ?
we need that patient list , your honor .
there is nothing in your affidavit
to support your assumption ,
that evidence of a crime will be discovered
if i allow you to
trample the rights of these patients .
all due respect , your honor --
both doctors were killed in their offices ,
where they see their patients .
i &apos;m not convinced .
absent a stronger link
between your crime and these patients ,
this is merely a fishing expedition .
have a good day .
judge allen , this is important .
so &apos;s the law , detective .
we understand , your honor , but without those names --
if you ever want me to sign another warrant for you again ,
i suggest you leave my chambers .
where are all your little &quot; dr. death &quot; friends ?
enjoying a lecture on using silicone scalps
for terminal ballistics testing .
mm , and you &apos;re missing it ?
i know ! &apos; cause i needed to get away from dr. pike .
i think pike is on the take .
what ?
he is using his position to privateer .
he &apos;s ... attacking foreign ships during wartime ?
i think he is taking kickbacks to hawk a forensic vacuum .
maura , this is very serious .
it is ?
no !
you haven &apos;t started the autopsy yet ?
pike is handing out hats and pens and travel mugs .
that is swag , detective .
i &apos;ll get our swag unit on it .
i need to know how to entrap him .
okay !
take it easy , serpico .
can we please solve our double homicide first ?
okay . help me undress her .
think you can be childless and have a fulfilling marriage ?
no . with or without children , marriage is miserable .
oh , not so .
studies show that parents &apos; happiness
has remained steady since 1972,
while non @-@ parents &apos; happiness has dropped .
did i tell you i &apos;m starting
a new organization called &quot; s.a.w. &quot; ?
that &apos;s a hostile acronym .
it stands for &quot; stuck at work . &quot;
and i &apos;m gonna be stuck here longer
if you don &apos;t get on it .
okay .
it &apos;s a shell casing .
where &apos;s the bullet that went through dr. rod ?
which means she was shot first ,
then he was shot ,
and the casing flew off into her sleeve .
damn . no prints .
wait .
thanks .
here .
ugh , come on .
not again with this weird husband guy .
look . &quot; hon , don &apos;t forget
your brazilian @-@ wax appointment . &quot;
what -- i mean , how many times i got to tell this guy ?
&quot; i &apos;m not your wife . &quot;
oh , forgot to tell you , frankie met lydia today .
you &apos;re looking very , very guilty .
what are you not telling me ?
i promised tommy that i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t say .
this looks very sharp .
okay .
okay .
but don &apos;t get mad .
what ? ! ! tommy slept with lydia ? !
i thought there wasn &apos;t any surveillance footage
of the victims &apos; offices ?
there isn &apos;t , but i found a private security camera
aimed at the building next to theirs .
thought i &apos;d see if maybe the killer walked by .
and how would you know if it was the killer ?
probably wouldn &apos;t .
but i did find this .
smart , frost .
what -- that &apos;s a city car collecting footage of boston .
yeah . and it drove by the parkers &apos; building
at 5 : 56 p.m. yesterday .
what ?
that &apos;s right before e.a. had an appointment with dr. rod .
check this out .
she &apos;s headed right toward their building .
you think we have enough landmarks for facial recognition ?
won &apos;t know till we try .
okay , she &apos;s pretty close .
frost , the man is closer .
oh , my god .
e.a. is eugene allen .
judge eugene allen ?
no wonder he wouldn &apos;t sign the warrants .
yeah , because he &apos;s a patient .
well , maybe he &apos;s a killer , too .
you want me to go with you ?
no . no , this one belongs to me and korsak .
go get him .
you can &apos;t go into his chambers .
you can &apos;t go in there .
how dare you enter my chambers ?
why wasn &apos;t that door locked ?
you &apos;re asking us ?
well , stop staring and shut the damn door .
i believe i told you not to return
until you had a stronger link
between your crime and dr. parker &apos;s patients .
that strong enough ?
did you kill him because he knew your secret ?
dr. parker helped me .
i &apos;m finally enjoying my life ,
my work ...
... because he encouraged me to be myself .
behind closed doors , i am
eugenia allen .
okay , eugenia .
sign these warrants for dr . eve and dr . rod &apos;s phone
and patient records .
you think you can blackmail me ?
you think you can block a homicide investigation
to keep your personal life quiet ?
need a pen ... uh , ma &apos;am ?
thank you .
you have no idea how fun medical examiners &apos; parties can be .
talk about the case -- you &apos;ll fit right in .
okay , so we got the patient lists .
it &apos;s like over 200 people .
well , i &apos;ll take a look at the doctors &apos; sessions notes .
maybe i can eliminate the nonviolent patients .
okay .
i mean , i think that dr. rod was the target .
i think dr. eve just picked the wrong time to go to the bathroom .
for you , detective rizzoli .
and since you &apos;re so good at stabbing people in the back ...
i haven &apos;t reported you to the bbvb ...
... yet .
bullet and
blast violation board .
oh , my .
jane !
swag !
attention , all swag units .
we have swag distribution in progress at the dirty robber .
this is very serious .
you could lose your bullet and blast certification .
ugh , not again !
what , another murder ?
another weird &quot; hon &quot; message .
&quot; hon , waiting up for you . &quot;
guess i should hurry home since i &apos;ve had my brazilian .
i think you should tell your mother .
where i wax is my business .
lydia &apos;s baby might be her grandchild .
that baby might also be her ex @-@ husband &apos;s bimbo &apos;s kid .
it &apos;s a good thing tommy &apos;s fishing in the gulf .
i want to kill him .
maybe that &apos;s why your father called off the engagement .
because lydia told him that
it might be tommy &apos;s baby ?
no , no , no , no .
no , no , no . this can &apos;t be happening .
no , no , no , no , no .
are you calling your father ?
no , i &apos;m gonna call frankie .
well , you can &apos;t tell him he might be an uncle over the phone .
but ...
oh , it &apos;s so nice to let my hair down
and enjoy a few long island iced teas .
how many have you had , dr. pike ?
not more than four .
or is it five ?
well , perhaps that &apos;s enough .
you look stunning tonight , dr. isles .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re like a wildcat , aren &apos;t you ?
lapping up that liquid with your delicate pink tongue .
please , stop .
i &apos;ve been in love with you , okay ?
since the outdoor remains recovery course .
what ? !
but i &apos;ve been desperately afraid .
i lost everything
with my quest to develop the perfect forensic vacuum .
i invested everything in particle @-@ vac , maura .
everything !
okay . stop . stop .
what ?
lady says go away , pike .
buzz off , popov .
you have as much chance with
woman as dead dr. parker .
no . the corpse has better chance .
come on .
you want a piece of me ?
let &apos;s go .
okay !
here , let me help you .
put up ducks .
these are &quot; dukes , &quot; you moron .
what the hell ? !
you call me moron , huh ?
pike declared his love for me .
what ? !
you two are drunker than old cooter brown !
if you don &apos;t quit , i &apos;m gonna whip you both so hard ,
you won &apos;t be able to sit down for a week !
thank you .
sorry about that .
how &apos;s your , uh , case going ?
you know , we don &apos;t have much forensic evidence .
i found a shell casing , but there &apos;s no prints .
i &apos;ve been working on this new technique
i studied over in england
where sweat can sometimes corrode the brass casing .
what , so you think
you might be able to pull up a print ?
i might . i can look at it for you tomorrow .
yeah , that &apos;d be great .
thank you very much .
all right , party &apos;s over . let &apos;s go .
and you &apos;re telling frankie .
i &apos;m telling frankie what ?
what do you want to tell me ?
maura knows about lydia .
that &apos;s what you wanted to tell me ?
no .
uh , okay .
it &apos;s about tommy .
and he , uh --
i can &apos;t believe i can &apos;t say this .
he slept with lydia .
he what ? !
maura !
lydia ?
lydia ?
oh , my god , maura , she needs your help .
ohh , i don &apos;t feel so good .
this is lydia sparks .
she ran into my new car .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
can you tell the doctor what &apos;s wrong ?
yeah , she &apos;s pregnant with your first grandchild ,
and she &apos;s drunk .
oh , god . come on .
uh , uh , let &apos;s get her on the couch .
okay , easy . i got it , ma . i got it . i got it .
here we go . here we go .
okay . easy , easy , easy , easy .
okay .
i like couches .
oh , you &apos;re really cute .
ma .
why would you bring a drunk , pregnant stranger
into maura &apos;s house ?
she came to the cafe ? to apologize .
she felt bad .
so , you cheered her up with malt liquor ?
we had dinner --
pasta , salad , some water .
i have to pee .
again ? sh @-@ she just went .
lydia , are you thirsty ?
i &apos;m really thirsty .
okay , frankie , call an ambulance .
what ? i need e.m.s ...
get her some orange juice .
can &apos;t she just sleep it off in her car ?
she has gestational diabetes .
well , how bad is that ?
bad . she &apos;s slipping into a diabetic coma .
will you hold my hand ?
i &apos;m really scared .
okay .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , all right ?
w @-@ we &apos;re gonna take care of you .
it &apos;s like my mother has a homing device for trouble .
that &apos;s where tommy gets it .
and we &apos;re throwing lydia back in the pond
as soon as she gets out of the hospital .
okay , but we &apos;re telling your mother who she is first .
i &apos;m calling a family meeting .
what ? it &apos;s not your family .
well , it &apos;s my guest house .
and i only have a one @-@ guest policy .
okay , let &apos;s see if we can solve these murders first .
w @-@ what ?
fine , i will get frankie and ma
to the dirty robber later today .
good morning , dr. isles . you don &apos;t look very well @-@ rested .
guess you don &apos;t know your limit .
you don &apos;t remember ?
did you do something inappropriate ?
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to prepare my presentation
on entrance and exit wounds .
you look stunning , detective .
got my fingerprint @-@ enhancement device .
you ready to try it ?
yeah , follow me , dr. rube goldberg .
w-- i &apos;m surprised you know who that is .
oh , maura ,
25 % of the population uses the internet .
oh , not fair .
it doesn &apos;t count if you have to use google .
can &apos;t get these in a forensic @-@ supply catalog .
i put this together myself .
never would have guessed .
so , the idea is the electrostatic charge
allows the fingerprint powder to adhere to the brass casing .
dr. john bond at leicester university developed it .
classic electrostatic physics .
shoot , i &apos;m only an expert in common electrostatic physics .
that &apos;s unbelievable .
you got a partial print .
but there isn &apos;t enough ridge detail .
all i need is enough to compare it
to a list of patients .
no tented arch on this one .
this one , either .
how many patients did we get elimination prints from ?
110 out of a total of 203 .
still got detectives out there trying to get the rest of them .
what the hell ?
what is it ?
nothing .
what ?
that &apos;s my phone number .
i --
oh , my god !
you thought i was one of dr. parker &apos;s patients ?
nothing to be ashamed of .
i think you &apos;ve hidden your
delusional disorders rather well , detective .
he called you three times last week .
i wonder why .
wha-- no .
hey , dominick .
uh , do you know how long you &apos;re gonna be ?
this is my car right here .
oh ! oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
c @-@ can you just put that back on the rack ?
yes .
i &apos;ll move the truck .
okay , thank you .
hey , you know what ?
why don &apos;t you grab a bag of ciabatta ?
it &apos;s still warm .
it &apos;s on the last rack .
okay . thank you .
sure .
this one ?
yeah .
thank you so much .
i &apos;ll see you later .
thank you--
i thought this would help ease tensions
in the family meeting .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a talking stick .
they &apos;ve been used for centuries by native americans .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
where &apos;s jane ? she said we were having a family meeting .
she will be here any minute .
sit down , ma .
take the talking stick .
i don &apos;t want the talking stick .
i want to know what this is about .
well , uh , the talking stick has been used by many cultures
to designate who has the right to speak .
which means the both of you
have something awful to tell me .
is this about tommy ?
give me that stick !
because i have a feeling
that i &apos;m going to have to use this stick
to knock some sense into your brother .
her car is still here .
she &apos;s not answering her phone .
she left over an hour ago to meet you guys .
she did ?
oh , my god . where is she ?
ma , come on . i &apos;m gonna get you home .
i &apos;m gonna try and track the gps on her phone ,
maybe get a location .
i &apos;ll be back . find her , okay ?
no signal on her phone . can &apos;t track it .
come on , think !
we &apos;re in the middle of this double @-@ homicide case .
we don &apos;t know if it &apos;s related .
we know dr . parker called jane .
the dead guy ? why &apos;d he call her ?
don &apos;t know .
wait , wait . he -- he treated patients
with severe delusional disorders .
it &apos;d be his ethical obligation
to call and to warn her
if he was treating someone who was a danger to her .
put up the patient list , frost .
and she was getting strange text messages .
someone on this list knows something .
oh , this could take all night .
we can &apos;t sit in here and go through lists !
okay , what about the partial print
from the casing ?
korsak , what if we tried
to put the two partial prints together ?
the one from the glove and the shell casing ?
it &apos;s a long shot .
we need a few more points .
rotate it to the left just a bit .
that might work . run it .
that &apos;s the man who delivers bread to the cafe ?
dominick bianchi --
served eight years for stalking and maiming ?
he was parker &apos;s patient .
you got an address ?
it &apos;s just the bakery .
oh , hell .
dominick has erotomanic delusional disorder .
doesn &apos;t sound good .
it &apos;s a serious psychiatric disorder .
he believes a stranger ,
most likely someone of a higher status ,
is in love with him .
so , he thinks jane &apos;s in love with him ?
hey , honey .
you missed your brazilian wax .
you were the one who was texting me ?
of course i did , honey .

in dominick &apos;s mind ,
dr. parker was breaking up your marriage .
and what a marriage it would have been .
did i show you my honeymoon pictures ?
oh , you went on a honeymoon ?
my head did .
apparently , we missed the luau .
i always wanted to go to a luau .
i &apos;m thinking of freezing my eggs .
okay , how much wine have you had ?
not much .
i just don &apos;t think marriage is for me .
but i &apos;d like to preserve my option to have children .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna leave my eggs right where they are .
and we &apos;re gonna talk about something else .
like what ? you and dr. pike .
