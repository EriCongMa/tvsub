&apos;cause when you ... you know , when you do that , so ...
okay , i &apos;m gonna guarantee you
that abby is responsible for that .
yeah , she got to me .
if you don &apos;t want abby to live here ,
jessica , why don &apos;t you just tell her ?
nick , you can &apos;t just tell abby to do something ,
&apos;cause she &apos;ll do the opposite .
so i &apos;m gonna have to go find a place for her to live
and make her think it &apos;s her idea .
she can &apos;t find out what i &apos;m up to .
do you think you can keep her busy and lie to her all day ?
jess , i come from a family of con artists and liars .
and the one thing i learned is , you can &apos;t lie to a liar .
it don &apos;t fly .
yeah , you shouldn &apos;t be involved .
no , i shouldn &apos;t .
wait a second .
are you doing reverse psychology ?

i mean , i can &apos;t tell who &apos;s in first place .
hey , uh , coach , you know how you &apos;re always getting on me about my pizza baby ?
yeah .
well , today is the day that i get rid of it .
i am here to train .

oh ! sex .
but i did book you for the entire afternoon , though .

coach , you should show him
that ground stretch you did on me earlier .
it was opening me up really nicely .
yes , please .

i &apos;m taking a little trip here , coach .
you know where i &apos;m going .

i just want to touch it .
don &apos;t touch it .
i just need to touch it .
but it &apos;s not for touching .
what ? can i not jump on it ?
abby .
that &apos;s not allowed ?
abby !
maybe i shouldn &apos;t
climb all over the car .
you need to get off of that car .
why don &apos;t you tell me what it is jess is up to ?
ma &apos;am , ma &apos;am , ma &apos;am , ma &apos;am ,
you &apos;re scratching the hood !
tell me what i want to know .

she &apos;s looking for a safe apartment for you
&apos;cause she doesn &apos;t want you to live with us !
now , would you please get off the car ?
do you guys serve drinks here ?
why don &apos;t they give us tasers ?
wow . i mean , this place is beautiful .
it makes the other nine places we &apos;ve seen today just kind of fade away .
yeah , um , tell me about the neighborhood .
is there a lot of nightlife ?
well , this part of town is pretty quiet .
unless you count church bells . which you should .
we have nine within hearing distance .
what about the other tenants ? are there single men
between 18 and 65 ? actually , make that 16 and 72 .
most of the other tenants are
middle @-@ aged gay veterans like myself .
oh . jackpot .
and if the demons come calling , there &apos;s an emergency room
right across the street .
you had me at &quot; gay veterans . &quot;
and then again at &quot; emergency room . &quot;
and before that at &quot; church . &quot;
i wish i could just travel back in time and tell 19 @-@ year @-@ old me
to move into a place like this .
maybe i would &apos;ve settled down . met a , you know , nice guy .
nothing flashy . he works in a bank , makes a great veggie lasagna .
okay , not now , cece .
no , don &apos;t stop her .
who is this guy ?
right ?
bet you are a mean dancer .
come on . live a little .
you were right to call me .
nobody deals with crazy girls better than i do .
crazy girls are kind of my hurt locker .
you know what i mean , nick ?
okay . yeah .
some @-@ some men , they can just walk away . not me .
i just keep coming back .

and how do we deal with nonsense ?
no , no . we just don &apos;t stand for it is what we do .
security is on the way .
come on , you old bird . get up here .

why don &apos;t you straighten things up with the museum ?
thank you . i appreciate that . it &apos;s only ten dollars !

you failed .
i didn &apos;t even ...
you know , it &apos;s not even a ...
yeah , it &apos;s not a big deal , so ...
you know , so ...
you should probably put a passcode on your phone , dude .
hey , schmidt !
hey , schmidt . have you seen abby ?
what ... are you ... what are you doing ?
i &apos;m melting chocolate .
abby and i are having sex .
what happened to no nonsense , schmidt ?
i &apos;ve really changed my tune on nonsense , nick .
you know , for the life of me ,
i could not understand the grasp
that jess had on you ,
but if she came from the same gene pool as this one ...
kudos , my friend .
even if it &apos;s a tenth of what i just experienced .
even if it &apos;s a devito / schwarzenegger
split from twins .
you calling jess the devito ?
what ?
abby , i was supposed to be watching you .
go ahead .
don &apos;t do ... don &apos;t play tricks with my words .
jess is gonna kill me .
she &apos;s gonna say my name in that short , clipped way
where she doesn &apos;t add the &quot; k. &quot;
what ?
when she &apos;s mad , she just says &quot; nic . &quot;
do you really think that the &quot; k &quot; adds to the sound of your name ?
yes .
how do you usually say your name ?
nick .
say it without the &quot; k. &quot;
nic .
it &apos;s the same thing .
stop distracting me !
nick , you &apos;re so worried about disappointing jess .
relax , man .
okay , you got to get out of here .
i choked .
i choked , man . i &apos;m 31 . i have nothing figured out .
can &apos;t i not find a job ?
i mean , i feel like i &apos;m losing it .
dude , they &apos;re hiring here .
you know i can &apos;t work here , man .
they never have any cookies .
it &apos;s all the better , man !
there &apos;s no pressure .
you get this job and then
when you &apos;re ready , you try the cop thing again .
okay .
see ?
yeah .
but now i &apos;m sitting here thinking
about how badly i need this job .
stop !
i need this job real bad ...
excuse me , um , could we get
a job application over here , please ?
in a way , i have a lot more riding on this job
than i do the cop thing .
god , i &apos;d love to work here !
i got the apartment !
the place is great . the only thing i &apos;m a little worried about
is there is a russian grocery store
and abby has a little bit of a weird thing
with ethnic white people .
but i think she could really thrive there !
where is she ?
where &apos;s who ?
abby .
ab ... ? oh , she &apos;s sleeping .
by herself .
which is called &quot; napping . &quot;
okay , i &apos;m gonna start secretly packing up some of her stuff .
do you think you can keep distracting her ?
yes , yeah , you know , just ...
good .
how do we distract her ?
how do you distract a woman like that ?
probably a guy .
right ? who can we set her up with ?
well , well , well , who do we have ? coach ...
no .
winston ...
that &apos;s actually kind of a good idea ...
no !
schmidt !
that &apos;s a terrible idea .
but in the same sense ...
abby will wreck schmidt !
well , then luckily , the ...
so , here &apos;s the plan .
we &apos;re gonna have a nice dinner ,
we &apos;re gonna get her buzzed but not drunk .
and then we &apos;re gonna casually and naturally
bring up the apartment
so she thinks it &apos;s her idea .
and i can do that , okay ?
okay , good .
i &apos;m glad .
i &apos;ll act cool , natural .
casual .
au naturel .
au casual .
you know what ?
maybe i should write you some lines , pal .
yeah , i &apos;d really appreciate that &apos; cause ...
maybe not a lot of words .
uh , so tell me ,
what are your three weakest qualities ?
see ...
just say &quot; perfectionist . &quot;
perfectionist .
yeah .
and the other two ... um ...
i &apos;m overheating , right ?
i &apos;m overheating , okay ?
so here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do now--
i &apos;m just gonna shoot from the hip , little rapid fire ,
give you some fun facts you might not know about me .
i hate standing up ,
i &apos;m bad with numbers ,
and ...
i just honestly , from the bottom of my heart ,
don &apos;t think women should be allowed to handle money .
just , that &apos;s for real .
let &apos;s just move on to the salary .
and you didn &apos;t even fill out the back of the application .
there &apos;s a back ?
there is a back to the application ?
coach .
what ?
the lapd exam-- maybe it had a back .
you didn &apos;t check to see if it had a back ?
we got to go to the precinct .
i didn &apos;t choke , i &apos;m just careless .
and that is my biggest weakness , you bitch .
i &apos;m so sorry , dude . i &apos;m so sorry , dude .
yeah , that was bad .
man , i didn &apos;t even mean that .
all right , get out of here .
get out of here .
dawg , i didn &apos;t mean that at all , man .
to our newest resident .
the city of angels
has sprouted another pair of wings .
it &apos;s a majestic city , drenched in sunshine ,
that is actually just a collection
of 75 different neighborhoods .
wow , i had no idea .
please continue to tell me more .
you want more ?
who wants to rediscover couscous ?
hey , what the hell are you doing here ,
schmidt ?
i invited him .
i live here , too , right ?
yeah , but ...
it &apos;s okay , abby can make her own decisions ,
no matter what they might lead to .
thank you .
now , somebody call the pound
&apos;cause my stomach is growling .
i said my stomach is growling .
okay , uh , speaking of dinner ,
there are a lot of great options
in north hollywood .
it &apos;s a real hot spot
full of young , hip people
who will be the leaders of tomorrow .
more wine ?
great .
if i were moving to l.a. now ,
i &apos;d say yes @-@ ho to noho .
hey , hey , what are you doing ?
oh , my .
stop touching him , abby .
i &apos;m sorry , what &apos;d you say ?
touch him more ?
do not touch him .
what are you ... ? do not do this right now .
how about that ?
as luck would have it , i actually know
of a place in north hollywood
with great tile work .
i said , &quot; great tile work . &quot;
oh , for the first 12 months .
i think what you really mean to say is
there &apos;s an introductory offer
for cable television .
that &apos;s it , yeah ...
cable &apos;s a scam , i tell ya .
sa ... ! satellite .
what happened to no nonsense , schmidt ?
satellite &apos;s where it &apos;s at .
nonsense has the hands of an angel .
okay , what &apos;s going on here ?
i told abby about the apartment , and now she &apos;s ...
giving schmidt a sp ... a special .
don &apos;t look at me .
just look away .
look away , look ... or look right at me .
so this was going on the whole time ?
yes .
and the hands are just the half of it .
i mean , there &apos;s been banging
and poking and scratching
and hanging and teasing ...
such teasing .
i mean , really excruciating ,
life @-@ giving teasing .
shut up , schmidt !
she was talking to me .
this has been a whole day of lying
and i can &apos;t take it .
first i had to lie to abby , and so i spilled the beans
about the apartment . i &apos;m sorry .
and then i had to lie about abby and schmidt and the boning .
and then the manipulating
and the out @-@ manipulating ...
that &apos;s lying !
if you guys were just honest with each other for one second ,
none of this would have happened .
okay . all right . abby ...
i &apos;m really sorry i tried to trick you ,
but i just want what &apos;s best for you .
one of us has to !
you know , that is your problem .
you think you &apos;re better
than people and you always try to fix them .
no , i don &apos;t !
yes , you do .
you &apos;ve done it your whole life . it &apos;s annoying .
you know what ? yes .
yes . i would like to fix you .
no ... i would love to fix you !
but i &apos;m done trying .
because you &apos;re not changing .
and you don &apos;t think or care
about other people at all , and i do .
and that &apos;s why i don &apos;t want you living in this loft .
that &apos;s honest .
you &apos;re a garbage person
and you should live in a dumpster with rotten snails .
hey ! nick !
too far !
yeah , way over the line , buddy .
yeah , but i thought we were just piling in ...
that &apos;s my sister , dude .
i didn &apos;t mean that , yeah .
sorry .
lucky for you ,
i &apos;m moving out .
oh , thank god , abby . oh , my god .
you &apos;re really gonna like this place .
it &apos;s so nice ...
i &apos;m moving in with schmidt .
what ... what &apos;s that , now ? you &apos;re moving in with who ?
seriously ?
we would have sex all the time .

ugh ! get out , schmidt !
get out of here !
okay ...

i took the test last week--
or should i say , i took the
front part of the test last week--
and , sir , i am here
to finish what i started .
what ?
what he &apos;s trying to say is ,
he took the entrance exam ,
but he forgot to do the back half .
well , the test is administered on a computer .
there is no back .
you took the test on a computer ?
i choked . i am a failure . i am a loser .

look at me .
you can do this , winston .
because now there &apos;s nothing to be afraid of .
you hit rock bottom , man .
this is the worst it &apos;s gonna get .
sir , it has been my dream to become a cop .
and no one &apos;s gonna stand in my way ...
not you , not him ...
hey , i was helping .
... and definitely not myself .
i would like to retake this test .
well , there &apos;s one at 7 : 30 tomorrow .

i &apos;m ready to take this test again in 12 hours ?
he &apos;ll be there .
yeah , i &apos;ll be there .
yeah .
thank you for messing everything up
and being such a terrible liar .
uh , you are very welcome .
i think i really needed
to say that stuff to my sister .
she &apos;s gonna wreck schmidt .
he has no idea .
i &apos;m sorry my family &apos;s so crazy .
crazy ?
your family &apos;s not crazy . my family &apos;s crazy .
my father used to trade horse semen .
i &apos;ve got an uncle
whose god @-@ given name is shifty .
well , thank goodness ...
we &apos;re the sane ones .
so ...
okay , now , remember : up , and ...
hello , abby .
hey . s &apos;up ?
have you thought about what you &apos;re gonna do
if they pair you with a dirty cop ?
well , then , i would just go to internal affairs .
well , that &apos;s a good way to get killed .
then at least i would die a hero .
hmm , no , you won &apos;t .
they &apos;ll put you in panties and then they &apos;ll plant you
next to a dead prostitute .
that &apos;s a poor lady .
it &apos;d be a dude .
but it &apos;s awesome !
good luck on the exam !
they got dude prostitututes ? nuh @-@ uh .
