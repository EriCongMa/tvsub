my sweet cassie , i didn &apos;t want you to have this life .
you &apos;re a witch . you &apos;re a full @-@ blooded , 100 % witch .
a complete circle is 6 .
you complete the circle .
that &apos;s my father .
john blackwell .
he died in the same fire that your parents did .
he was at the fire 16 years ago .
i have to find out what happened that day .
this is our only chance .
john blackwell ,
you &apos;ve been accused and found guilty .
confess your sins .
what are you doing here ?
you-- you can see me ?
get out . now .
dawn ?
she put you up to this ?
she &apos;s playing you , ethan .
as soon as she gets the crystal back , you &apos;re dead .
i found this .
my father was wearing it the day of the fire .
it saved him .
is there a chance that he &apos;s still alive ?
how did you--
diana said you were here .
is your grandmother back ?
actually , no . i just came to grab some more of my stuff .
come in .
everything ok ?
something happen between you and diana ?
no , but she did mention something a little disturbing , though .
did you dig up your father &apos;s grave ?
with jake ?
she told you ?
was she not supposed to ?
are you and jake &apos;s crazy adventures a secret now ?
i know it sounds bad--
cassie , it is bad .
adam , my father didn &apos;t die in the boat yard fire .
i saw him leave ,
and i need to know if he &apos;s still out there .
breaking the law and risking exposure is not the way to do it .
neither is getting dragged into jake &apos;s memory and almost dying .
is this about me or jake ?
both .
i will not let anything happen to you ,
and jake seems to be the guy who &apos;s making bad things happen .
digging up the grave was my idea .
and because of jake , i saw my father .
and found this .
we don &apos;t even know what that is , cassie .
look , since figuring out who we are ,
we have tried to take things slowly and carefully .
what you have been doing lately crosses the line .
and jake is pushing you .
he &apos;s just trying to help .
if your father is alive ,
i will do anything and everything
to find out for sure ,
and not because i &apos;m obsessed with
your family &apos;s legacy of dark magic--
because i care about you .
present @-@ day you .
the you and i kissed the other night .
there &apos;s no room for jake between us .
you &apos;re back .
had to make sure adam and cassie
don &apos;t get to second base , huh ?
jealousy isn &apos;t a good look on you .
i heard witch hunters killed your parents .
i know you , jake . you want payback .
what &apos;s your point ?
you &apos;re barking up the wrong shrub with cassie .
she won &apos;t understand . she &apos;s not the type .
she &apos;s not your type .
thanks , doc .
why don &apos;t you go deal with your sense of powerlessness
and ... burn down another school ?
there &apos;s the jake i remember .
can i help you ?
you &apos;re amelia blake &apos;s daughter .
yes .
cassie .
you look so familiar . have we met before ?
16 years ago in the boat yard fire .
you were at the boat yard fire ?
yes .
and i &apos;ve been reliving that day over and over for 16 years .
then last week , for the first time ,
my memory changed .
suddenly , you were there .
and now , whenever i think back ,
i can see you in the ferry &apos;s cafeteria ,
and me telling you to get out .
please , can i come in ?
i &apos;m taking a risk just being here .
yes . yeah . yeah .
thank you .
my name is lucy gibbons .
i knew your mother .
when i first saw you in my memory ,
i thought you were her .
you told me to get out right before the fire started .
you were trying to protect me .
later , i realized you were visiting
in someone else &apos;s mind .
you were tethered to someone who really was there .
how could you have even seen me ?
are you a witch ?
no .
but i have other abilities .
i &apos;m a psychic .
every moment , every event in time ,
has its own psychic imprint .
you being there altered the imprint ,
and i felt it , saw you .
what were you doing there ?
i was close with your parents &apos; circle .
i helped them ...
when i could .
so you knew my father ?
very well .
he was a hero that day .
his death was a terrible tragedy .
i saw him escape the fire .
i thought he died in that room .
no . i saw him leave .
but i don &apos;t know what happened after--
i &apos;m sorry .
there &apos;s no time to talk .
i &apos;ve come here to warn you .
about what ?
witch hunters .
i &apos;ve been hiding from them for 16 years .
and yesterday , one of them found me .
but you &apos;re not a witch .
he was asking about you .
why ?
someone else must &apos;ve seen you like i did
and told them you were there and know what really happened .
they &apos;re coming for you , just like they came for your father .
and they &apos;ll kill me if they know i &apos;m here .
wait !
why are you telling me this ?
why risk your life to warn me ?
i owe it to your parents .
they meant a lot to me .
i &apos;m staying at the ocean vista motel for the night .
be careful , cassie .
ethan ?
you sent ethan after me ?
you want coffee ?
he &apos;s an unstable , pathetic drunk .
and now , he has the power of a crystal .
why ? just so i wouldn &apos;t ?
what &apos;s happened to us ?
how &apos;d we end up on opposite sides like this ?
when you threatened to kill my mother , it occurred to me
that you and i aren &apos;t exactly on the same page .
look , we have both had to do things we &apos;re not happy about ,
but the end goal-- getting our power back-- that hasn &apos;t changed .
not for me .
i &apos;m going to get that crystal back .
and the next time you cross me will be your last .
hi , mr. conant . is adam around ?
he should be back pretty soon .
you want to wait ?
i wanted to talk to you anyway .
anything wrong ?
no . in fact ,
i want to throw a surprise party for adam &apos;s birthday .
is there any chance you could give me a hand ?
i &apos;d love to .
i was wondering what i was going to do for his birthday .
it &apos;s weird .
last year , i was so excited .
i broke into his locker and filled it with cookies .
and this year ,
i &apos;m not even sure how to sign a birthday card .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know he cares about you .
i think a surprise party is a great idea ,
and i &apos;d love to help .
surprise party .
well , that sounds fun .
forget the surprise part .
be here at 8 : 00 .
fun , food , and drinks .
did she say who , exactly , was coming after you ?
like which gang of witch hunters ?
no . i don &apos;t think anyone knows them as well as you .
i &apos;m just trying to understand how bad it is .
do you trust her ?
i don &apos;t know if i trust you .
you don &apos;t , or adam doesn &apos;t ?
both .
and yet , here we are--
you and me , trying to figure out how to save everyone ,
no trace of adam .
he &apos;s worried about me .
i don &apos;t want him to worry .
now , how the hell does this work ?
if we can figure it out , we can stop the witch hunters ,
for good .
let &apos;s try it downstairs .
the symbol matches the one on the ceiling , right ?
finally making yourself useful .
now what ?
i have no idea .
oh . maybe if i align it in just the right way--
or catch the light ...
there must be a spell that can activate its energy .
there was one . my father said it at the fire .
i just ... don &apos;t remember .
what &apos;s happening ?
something feels completely wrong .
jake , run ! get out of here !
i can &apos;t move !
what the hell is going on ?
adam ! wait .
look , i was just trying to figure out the medallion .
the whole house felt like it was coming down .
a woman came to see me ,
someone i saw at the boat yard fire 16 years ago .
and i know that that sounds crazy .
she said the witch hunters are coming ,
just like jake said .
this medallion is the best way i know how to protect us .
i saw my dad use it to stop them .
and yet , my mom is still dead .
just like diana &apos;s and melissa &apos;s and nick &apos;s .
so , jake &apos;s , too .
what if the medallion makes things worse ?
diana &apos;s grandmother told you
that your father became consumed by that kind of magic .
what other choice do we have ?
you are not alone in this .
the power of the circle ,
that &apos;s all the protection we need .
ok .
maybe you &apos;re right .
so are we done here ?
you and adam going to go get ready for the next school dance
and pretend everything &apos;s fine ?
no , we &apos;re not done .
let &apos;s go talk to lucy .
diana said all they found in the coffin were dog bones .
diana , your new bestie ?
faye , i just told you cassie dug up her father &apos;s grave .
of course she did .
because she &apos;s a creepy little stepford ghoul
with dark magic and daddy issues .
she &apos;s part of the circle , and so are you .
no matter what happened ,
you can &apos;t just pretend you &apos;re not .
maybe i can .
check it out .
devil &apos;s spirit .
it &apos;s supposed to help you tap into
your inner strength and power .
we could both use a little of that , don &apos;t you think ?
your creepy lee friend give you that stuff ?
no . his even creepier biker pal .
you should go help .
get ordered around by a control freak in party planning mode .
or ...
you could tap into your inner melissa .
lucy ? it &apos;s me , cassie blake .
are you alone ?
i &apos;m with a friend , jake armstrong .
hurry .
quite a barricade .
i don &apos;t have powers like you .
how do you know i have powers ?
i &apos;m a psychic .
for what that &apos;s worth .
i wanted to ask you something .
about my father &apos;s medallion .
the balcoin medallion ?
i saw him use it against the witch hunters .
that &apos;s how he escaped .
could i use it , too ? to protect us .
absolutely .
but unfortunately , the medallion was lost to us .
i found it .
but we don &apos;t know how to use it .
i almost tore down a house trying .
that &apos;s because it needs to be unlocked .
activated .
if you are a bound circle ,
you can do a ritual to activate the medallion .
and then , it can do what it did that day
to eben and the other witch hunters ?
if i were to help , would you be seeking protection or revenge ?
both .
can you help us ?
yes , i can get the spell .
is there somewhere safe we can meet later ?
my father &apos;s old house .
oh , uh , just a minute , cassie .
you should see your face right now .
how did you find me ?
that day when you betrayed us ,
i told you never to come back here again .
and i marked you .
you don &apos;t remember ?
do you mind ?
oh , my god .
jake ?
what ?
the medallion is gone .
i &apos;m just here visiting a friend .
cassie blake ? is that your friend ?
you know i was close with amelia .
when i heard cassie come here--
you thought you &apos;d pop by and tell her
how you killed her father ?
i just wanted to see if cassie was ok .
you were supposed to protect blackwell .
you were his psychic .
you should &apos;ve seen when the hunters coming .
they must &apos;ve blocked my sight somehow .
you know i &apos;d give anything to get that day back .
well , you can &apos;t .
there may be something you can do to make it up to me .
what do you mean ?
what do you know about family crystals ?
why ?
because i need to find them .
dawn , i can &apos;t do that .
those crystals aren &apos;t yours to find .
i am giving you a chance to make up for your mistakes .
and considering your abilities ,
i assume you &apos;ll know what will happen to you if you don &apos;t .
it can &apos;t just have disappeared .
who else could have gotten in here ?
well , the book of shadows is still there .
so someone was just after the medallion .
but no one knows about that drawer ,
or has even seen me use it .
what ?
there is one person .
you really didn &apos;t have to do this .
but thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
but it was mostly diana .
that girl can plan .
i &apos;m impressed .
diana was able to find enough random classmates
to make it look like adam has friends
other than us 5 .
this isn &apos;t easy for her .
trying to move on from adam and still be there for him
and everyone else ?
sounds exhausting .
i think she &apos;s brave and strong .
oh , i forgot .
you guys are a super duo now .
&quot; delissa , &quot; is it ?
let it go . have some fun .
the music is amazing .
and the food is amazing , too .
i loved those puffed pastry things .
they tasted like gold .
are you messed up right now ?
you don &apos;t feel ... shiny ?
maybe i should do some more .
yeah , let &apos;s .
well , that &apos;s just perfect .
call the biker guy . get some more .
thank you .
happy birthday .
this is amazing .
it was mostly your dad .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s exactly what he just said .
we both thought you deserved an adam appreciation night .
and i think you &apos;re both right .
weren &apos;t you going to make a toast ?
oh , yeah . thanks .
thanks for coming , everyone .
uh , i &apos;m better at
incoherent rambling than speeches ,
so i &apos;ll keep it short .
happy birthday , son .
i don &apos;t say this enough .
i love you .
happy birthday , adam .
happy birthday , adam .
uh , diana , um , didn &apos;t you want to ...
you know , you wannna say a toast ?
ok .
adam &apos;s been a part of my life for as long as i can remember .
he was ... the kid who always shared his toys .
who always said something
when someone tried taking yours without asking .
and i remember getting into the habit of
looking to him first to see how he &apos;d react to things
so i could tell the difference between right and wrong .
happy birthday .
it &apos;s ... knowing you
that &apos;s always kept me headed in the right direction .
and i &apos;ll always be grateful .
to adam .
to adam .
to adam .
that was a nice toast .
that &apos;s a good son you &apos;ve got there .
i know .
it &apos;s a shame about adam and diana .
clearly , they still have a lot of affection for each other .
what are you doing here , charles ?
diana asked me to come . and i &apos;m glad i did .
you know , watching these
kids really puts things into perspective .
we were just like them once .
ironically , i needed a visit from my mother
to realize how many bad choices i &apos;ve made recently .
i &apos;m sorry .
tonight &apos;s about the kids .
happy birthday .
thanks .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you took my father &apos;s medallion .
yeah , i did .
how could you ?
because someone has to stop you before you hurt yourself .
i need it . lucy knows the ritual to activate the medallion ,
and until we do it , we &apos;re all sitting ducks .
how do you know that ?
i went to her hotel--
you and jake .
you gave me no choice .
this is about protecting the circle ,
and you were making it about jealousy .
jake accepts that dark magic is a part of me .
and he doesn &apos;t ask me to hide from who i am .
who you are ?
jake &apos;s killed people for being who you are .
he hasn &apos;t killed anyone .
he came back looking for revenge after nick &apos;s death ,
and maybe he planned on taking that out on the circle ,
but he didn &apos;t go through with it .
he &apos;s changed .
are you sure ,
or is that just what you want to believe ?
you were supposed to call me from the car .
i wanted to come check out the party .
are you callum ?
the devil stuff guy ?
i &apos;ve been called worse .
i &apos;m melissa .
did you bring it ?
great . transaction done . now you can go .
i think i &apos;ll stay .
suddenly , the night just shows some great potential .
this is a private party , callum .
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve got this , jake .
better listen to her , &quot; jake . &quot; she &apos;s got this .
who are you ?
a friend of faye &apos;s voodoo boyfriend .
get out .
watch your back , jake .
where did you go ?
to the boat .
here you go .
i have no right to make decisions for you .
thank you .
i &apos;ll let lucy and the rest of the circle know .
how do you know everyone will agree to do it ?
it &apos;s the only way to protect ourselves .
maybe .
everything i said about jake is true .
and somewhere inside you ,
i think you know it .
dad ?
you ok ?
well , i didn &apos;t have a drink , if that &apos;s what you mean .
no , i was just ...
it &apos;s ok , kid . really .
i &apos;m just wiped out . i must be coming down with something .
dad .
thanks for the party .
everybody &apos;s having a great time .
means a lot to me .
i &apos;m glad .
you have a lot of friends here who really care about you .
i &apos;m going to go grab some aspirin .
go have fun .
you ok ?
where &apos;d you get that ?
adam had it .
he stole it .
to protect me .
from what ?
its power .
the potential for dark magic inside of it .
he doesn &apos;t think you can handle it . he &apos;s wrong .
no , that &apos;s not it .
he thinks that it &apos;s dangerous .
i don &apos;t care what adam thinks .
i care what you think .
have you ever murdered a witch ?
cassie .
come in .
we can sit in the living room .
i &apos;ve gathered photos that will help us
tap into each family &apos;s energies .
we &apos;re not going to need them .
lucy .
you can forget the crystals , dawn .
you see , the witch hunters are coming back to chance harbor .
and after tonight , the circle won &apos;t have any power to stop them .
i &apos;ve always been on the right side , dawn .
and it was never yours .
that was a great party , adam .
i had so much fun .
happy birthday , adam !
so we just have to do what you say
&apos;cause you &apos;re the queen of dark magic ?
if we don &apos;t activate the medallion ,
then we &apos;re vulnerable to witch hunters .
we don &apos;t know that .
maybe we can use our full power
to stop them without the medallion .
but why take the chance ?
you saw your father use it , right ?
you know it works ?
yes .
then i think we should activate it .
me , too .
fine .
ok . i &apos;ll go along with the rest of the circle .
all right . i told lucy we &apos;d meet in the woods behind the house .
adam ...
you were right ... about jake .
i accept who you are .
i just don &apos;t accept that you &apos;re only defined by dark magic .
i think you &apos;re ... much more than that .
i know .
sorry i &apos;m late .
that &apos;s ok .
well , the sooner we start , the safer you &apos;ll be .
form a circle around the fire and hold hands .
the last time we all stood around a fire , we bound the circle .
and look how well that worked out .
focus on the fire .
breathe deeply ,
slowly .
air we breathe ,
and fire we feel .
air we breathe ,
and fire we feel .
the medallion &apos;s getting warm .
stay focused , cassie .
air we breathe .
and fire we feel .
air we breathe ,
and fire we feel .
i don &apos;t feel so great .
what you &apos;re feeling is your magic activating the medallion .
we &apos;re almost done .
by this circle ,
bind air and fire to metal ,
and ignite its power .
by this circle ,
bind air and fire to metal ,
and ignite its power .
no , something &apos;s wrong . i--i can feel it .
it feels like it did
when faye tried the spell at the fire and ice dance .
the medallion , it &apos;s taking our magic .
i &apos;m sorry .
the medallion channels power in or out .
it &apos;s stolen the magic from thousands of witches .
that &apos;s what makes it so strong .
now , it &apos;s taking yours .
this is my father &apos;s medallion .
i saw him use it against the witch hunters .
and i remember what he said now .
no .
ignus despair ad volum .
you lied about everything .
she must be working for the witch hunters .
is that true ?
they threatened me .
gave me no choice .
you told me that you didn &apos;t know
if my father was alive or dead .
but if you &apos;re really a psychic ,
you could sense his energy .
tell me the truth .
is he alive ?
yes .
no one has any idea where he is . no one .
aah ! hey ! i swear it !
kill me , go ahead , but i don &apos;t know anything more .
never come back to chance harbor .
and you can tell the hunters that i have the medallion ,
and i know how to use it .
we &apos;re ready for them .
let her go .
she &apos;s not coming back .
are you ok ?
my father &apos;s alive .
i need to find him .
i &apos;ll help you .
i don &apos;t think so .
don &apos;t push me away .
we &apos;re not so different .
what you were feeling here with lucy ,
letting your anger drive you ,
that &apos;s what you &apos;ll need to beat the witch hunters .
no .
i &apos;m not like you at all , jake .
dawn .
you saved me .
yeah .
i was surprised you called .
but i &apos;m glad you did .
thing is ,
you remind me of an old boyfriend of mine .
you miss an old flame , i reap the benefits .
this is about devil &apos;s spirit .
it made the night a lot easier .
you went through that last bag a little fast .
please be careful , ok ?
i can take care of myself .
no doubt .
i got your text . what do you want ?
you failed .
i &apos;m the one who came to you .
i &apos;m the one who told you
cassie blake saw the medallion .
if i hadn &apos;t seen her in my memory ,
you &apos;d never know where it was .
and yet , you weren &apos;t able to bring it back to me .
by leaving it behind ,
you &apos;ve opened the door for blackwell &apos;s return .
i &apos;m sorry . she was too strong .
so i keep hearing .
i guess i &apos;m just going to have to see for myself .
