desperate housewives s07 e03
susan showed a certain flair for her new job .
there you go . you know , you &apos;re getting good at this .
renee rented a house .
wow , that is so ...
wonderful ?
close .
there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
gaby learned the truth
about her daughter being switched at birth .
beth !
paul young continued to surprise everyone .
well , i see you &apos;ve all met my wife .
and tom came home with a mysterious affliction .
i &apos;m not feeling well .
again ?
i &apos;m just gonna lie on the couch and watch some tv .
tom scavo was depressed ,
and his wife had done everything she could
to cheer him up .
she had made his favorite meals .
she had told her funniest jokes .
she &apos;d even worn her sexiest lingerie .
but nothing worked .
finally , lynette insisted her husband go to the doctor .
unfortunately , what he came home with was a prescription ...
for trouble .
antianxiety medication ?
this is what he gave you ?
dr. weiler says it will help . -
he spent 20 minutes with you .
lynette .
and let me guess .
did he write this with a pen
that has the drug company &apos;s name on it ?
i need this medicine .
then take it , but i gotta tell ya ,
those drugs scare the crap out of me .
i gotta do something . i am so tired of feeling this way .
but you &apos;ve gone through rough patches before .
you could come out of it .
so wait around to get better ? that &apos;s your answer ?
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like inside my head !
okay , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . hey ! hey !
remember when susan kept having all those headaches ?
who was that guy that she went to ?
doctor ... dr. ross .
how is he gonna be any different ?
he &apos;s holistic .
he tries to stay away from heavy meds . susan loved him .
and if he says i should be on this ?
then you have a second opinion .
whatever he says , i &apos;ll go with it .
i saw dr. ross .
oh ! i &apos;m so glad .
did you like him ?
loved him .
and you were right .
he--he doesn &apos;t believe in pharmaceuticals .
he only prescribes stuff that &apos;s totally herbal and natural .
that is fantastic .
so what did he suggest ?
medical marijuana .
yes ,
tom scavo had been battling depression ,
but he was now facing a much bigger battle
with his wife .
happiness--
it &apos;s something we all want ,
and so we search for it .
little girls find it in the taste of chocolate .
well @-@ dressed men discover it at their local mall .
teenage boys experience it
when talking to a pretty girl .
and then there are housewives ,
who simply can &apos;t be happy until they &apos;ve learned
everything they can
about the newest neighbor on the block .
hello !
hi . so sorry to interrupt . this will just take a second .
we wanted to officially welcome you to the neighborhood .
this is my friend lynette and susan ,
and i was telling them about you , and we--
just had to meet you .
immediately .
that &apos;s so sweet .
oh , you--you &apos;re my landlady , right ?
yes , but i really want you to think of me as a friend .
are those pictures hung on the wall with nails or--
um , we wanted to invite you to our weekly poker game .
shoot . i don &apos;t know how to play poker .
oh , don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll teach you .
does that ficus tree have a saucer underneath ?
because those are hardwood floors .
and while you &apos;re learning all about texas hold &apos;em ,
we &apos;ll learn all about you .
aw ! that sounds fun .
okay , well , uh , we should be going . we &apos;ll see you later .
okay .
bye .
bye .
what did those women want ?
they invited me to play cards with them .
but they were just being friendly .
on this street ,
never confuse being nosy with being friendly .
they were digging for dirt .
so ...
do you not want me to go ?
no , no . you will go .
give them all sorts of meaningless information .
and hopefully , they &apos;ll start to think of you as a friend .
but ... if you don &apos;t like them ,
why do you want me to be friends with them ?
in time , it will be useful .
where &apos;s the pen ?
don &apos;t you wanna read it first ?
why ? did a nurse get drunk
and swap it with a different document ?
by signing this , mr. solis , you are agreeing
not to bring any legal action against this hospital .
do you understand ?
and in return , you &apos;ll stop searching for the other family .
do you understand ?
done . gaby .
babe , we talked about this .
we don &apos;t know how this other family will react ,
and we need to protect juanita .
i am sorry , gabrielle .
i can only imagine how you must feel .
you can &apos;t begin to imagine how i feel .
the only person who could is the woman
who has my daughter .
if signing can spare her this pain ...
then i will do it .
i love it !
somehow i get the feeling you don &apos;t love it .
okay , i @-@ i don &apos;t love it . it &apos;s just so ...
yellow .
trust me . this will be great .
besides , when you &apos;re in the room ,
nobody &apos;s looking at the walls anyway .
well , you certainly know how to sell yellow .
excuse me .
i hear you &apos;re gettin &apos; divorced .
and good morning to you .
i &apos;m getting divorced , too , so we both need guys .
i &apos;m thinking we should hang .
uh , i don &apos;t know how much lynette has told you about me ,
but i &apos;m really not one for ... hanging .
look , one woman at a bar is just sad .
but two , and it &apos;s girls &apos; night out .
so what do you say ?
you up for a little stud hunting ?
that &apos;s a lovely offer , but i think i &apos;m gonna pass .
oh , come on .
we gotta get back in the game ,
cut loose , let our hair down .
that hair does come down , doesn &apos;t it ?
really , renee , that is just not how i like to meet men .
well , how else you gonna meet &apos; em ,
sittin &apos; around your house ?
you &apos;d be surprised .
you &apos;ve met someone already ?
maybe .
a beautiful , classy woman
who can get a man without leaving the house .
i don &apos;t see us being friends .
i don &apos;t know
how everything gets so dirty in here .
is that a piece of lint ?
oh , no !
it got my apron !
i &apos;d better sign off before i &apos;m completely naked .
see you tomorrow , boys .
i &apos;m busy !
honey , it &apos;s maxine !
a star is born !
did you watch ?
oh , not only did i watch , i kvelled .
oh ! i have to admit , i am sort of getting into it .
that whole thing with the vacuum just came to me .
well , that &apos;s how it happens with the great ones . oops .
here &apos;s a bonus for you .
what &apos;s this for ?
well , it &apos;s a little something i do for
the girl who gets the most hits in a month .
you just unseated stacy strauss ,
and with the caboose on her , that &apos;s not easy .
oh , maxine . you &apos;re so good to me .
oh , honey .
mmm . you know what ?
mike and i are finally starting to save some money .
well , don &apos;t save it all . buy yourself something nice .
you deserve it . oh , by the way ,
have you decided what you &apos;re gonna do for tomorrow &apos;s show ?
i &apos;m gonna damp mop in bikini briefs .
ooh ! are you trying to make me cry ?
bye , doll .
this is a great sandwich .
what &apos;s in it ?
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
just a little parma ham cured by italian monks
and some cave @-@ aged gruyere ,
and of course i make my own fig mustard .
cooking is a passion of mine .
of course , it &apos;s not much fun cooking for one ,
so , um , if you &apos;re free this weekend--
babe , you gotta try this sandwich . it rocks .
this is my boss , mrs. van de kamp .
this is stephanie , my girlfriend .
you have a girlfriend ?
of course you have a ...
a girlfriend who &apos;s young and pretty .
nice to meet you .
i &apos;m sorry , bree . what were you about to ask me ?
oh , it &apos;s , uh , wasn &apos;t important .
you enjoy your sandwich .
inside , over there .
let the stud hunt begin .
come on . come on . we &apos;re gonna get started .
you okay ?
oh . yeah .
yeah .
let &apos;s play cards .
when i was 8 , daddy left mama ,
and we were pretty much alone .
most of my friends were either stuffed or plastic .
of course , there were always mama &apos;s boyfriends ,
but as soon as i &apos;d learn their names ,
mama would kick them out ,
and therd be a new toothbrush in the bathroom .
uh , l @-@ let me know if i &apos;m sharing too much .
no . not at all .
keep pouring the chardonnay .
she &apos;s cracking like an egg .
okay , quarter ante .
so , beth , how did you and paul meet anyway ?
oh , i don &apos;t wanna bore you .
we won &apos;t be bored . more chardonnay ?
mm .
well ... i saw his picture in the paper during his trial ,
and there was just something about those eyes
that spoke to me .
what about the headline ?
&quot; arrested for murder &quot; -- that didn &apos;t speak to you ?
i &apos;ll admit that gave me pause .
but then we started corresponding ,
and i discovered
what a wonderful man paul really is .
bree , let &apos;s forget about hittin &apos; the clubs tomorrow night .
clearly , all the best guys are on death row .
but , hey , you can &apos;t help
who you fall in love with , right ?
and paul &apos;s a real lady @-@ killer .
we--we always fogged up the plexiglas with that one .
well , it &apos;s good that you can laugh about it .
the thing is ,
in my heart , i always knew he was innocent ,
and i was right .
well , he is .
yeah , so let &apos;s play cards .
what are you doing ?
preparing to take my medicine .
i &apos;ve heard that an increase in appetite &apos;s
a possible side effect ,
so i &apos;m taking the necessary precautions .
necessary precautions
being your own weight in cheese doodles ?
i never smoked pot before ,
so i wanna be prepared .
headphones ?
pink floyd .
apparently , it complements the medicinal properties
of , uh ...
blueberry bliss .
listen to you .
you are loving this .
tom the college nerd .
gets to finally smoke pot and be cool .
hey , i was plenty cool in college .
the only reason i didn &apos;t smoke back then
was because i signed the abstinence pledge
with my dungeons &amp; dragons club .
so ... what do you say ?
care to join me out back behind the garage
for a little doobage ?
&quot; doobage &quot; ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re calling your medicine now ?
come on . you need to take this seriously .
i @-@ i am .
really ? &apos; cause i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;ve never asked you
to join me behind the garage to split a midol .
lynette , you said you would go with this .
i know , but how is it gonna look to the kids ?
i don &apos;t want them seeing
their dad stoned .
oh , you--you don &apos;t have to worry about them seeing me stoned .
they &apos;ll never know .
hey , the--
okay .
so what do you wanna do saturday night ?
well , i was thinking
that we could go to chez naomi .
isn &apos;t our price range more chez chicken hut ?
mike , it &apos;s our anniversary .
besides , we &apos;ve been working really hard .
we deserve it .
okay , but bring your big purse
&apos;cause we &apos;re taking the dinner rolls home .
so ...
chez naomi , huh ?
expensive place .
yeah . yeah , i guess it is .
must be nice .
um , have we met ?
i &apos;m in 1b . susan delfino .
oh , i know who you are .
i &apos;m 1f .
stacy strauss .
uh , y @-@ you &apos;re one of maxine &apos;s ...
yeah .
oh , well , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
guess we ...
kind of do the same thing .
oh , sometimes we do exactly the same thing .
what does that mean ?
i keep an eye on the competition .
you lifted one of my moves .
no , i didn &apos;t .
you expect me to believe
you just woke up one day and decided to
put a feather duster in your mouth ?
you do that ?
it &apos;s my signature bit , and you stole it .
i swear . i ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t watch the other girls perform .
okay , so i guess it &apos;s just a coincidence .
well , here &apos;s another coincidence--
you &apos;re getting the big bonus check , and i &apos;m not .
that &apos;s not ... really what you &apos;d call a coincidence .
that &apos;s really more ...
all right , college .
just keep the duster out of your mouth .
and watch your back .
everything okay ?
oh , yeah .
i am wasted .
really ?
i am lucy in the sky high .
so ...
this must be pretty intense for you
and don &apos;t forget .
tomorrow we have to trombone 3 @-@ d banana patch .
remember ?
man , this is , uh , really strong stuff .
snow shovel .
exactly .
you know , i was just upstairs watching paige sleep ,
with her little fingers and her little toes .
i @-@ i must &apos;ve watched her for , like , an hour .
she &apos;s just so perfect .
and i am so lucky .
i couldn &apos;t feel happier than i do right now .
i mean just so happy it &apos;s working .
yeah .
what do you think ? does this say
&quot; happy anniversary , mike . i &apos;ll love you forever &quot; ?
no . i think it says &quot; credit card declined . &quot;
aren &apos;t you and mike on a budget ?
yeah , but things are starting to turn around lately .
i &apos;ve been selling a lot of my jewelry .
get out !
out there and keep selling .
oh , hello , silk !
oh , how i &apos;ve missed your soft touch .
i &apos;m going to the dressing room .
mm , you two have fun .
mommy ?
oh . you &apos;re not my mommy .
are you lost , sweetie ? what &apos;s your name ?
kiki ! you scared me ! i couldn &apos;t find you .
i have a little girl , too .
sometimes they get
distracted and wander off .
let &apos;s go .
wait !
how old is she ?
8 .
my daughter &apos;s 8 .
when &apos;s your birthday ?
uh , we &apos;ve really gotta go .
uh , okay , but , uh , what hospital was she born in ?
was it fairview memorial ?
standing there in the mall , it just hit me .
i can &apos;t spend the rest of my life
wondering if every little girl i see
is my daughter .
not knowing where she is ,
it--it &apos;s like my heart living outside of my body .
i have to find her .
well , there &apos;s a private detective i work with .
but sanchez is a pretty common name .
it &apos;s not surprising the hospital couldn &apos;t find &apos; em .
but i know something the hospital doesn &apos;t .
when i was in labor ,
the other woman &apos;s mother came into my room by mistake ,
and we got to talking .
she lived in el paso , and she was so excited to have
her granddaughter baptized at santa maria &apos;s church .
that &apos;s gonna help .
so you think you can find her ?
we &apos;ll do our best .
carlos is on board with this , right ?
absolutely .
okay , then give me ten porterhouse .
hey . i just came by to pick up my envelope for the week .
okay . inside .
and don &apos;t listen to this conversation .
it &apos;s about your christmas gift .
i &apos;m buying all my girls steaks . you got a preference ?
whatever meat you put in my stocking will be fine .
ooh , that sounds dirty . use that .
i &apos;m back .
what else have you got for me ?
rib eye ? i like it .
is that a piece of lint ?
that &apos;s my bit .
max--maxine !
what ? ! i &apos;m on with the meat guy .
yeah , but stacy strauss
is stealing my vacuum bit !
oh , my god . well , if she &apos;s gonna do that ,
at least teach her how to use the nozzle .
hey there . i &apos;m ready to party .
are you ? &apos; cause you look like
you &apos;re ready to tour the reagan library .
this is a cocktail cardigan .
look closely . the buttons are shiny .
where &apos;s your closet ?
i have never seen so many sweater sets .
are you sure this is a closet and not a portal to the 1950s ?
there is nothing wrong with my clothing .
bree , you &apos;re going to a hot young club
full of hot young people . you need to dress the part .
well , i happen to find it distasteful
when mutton is dressed as lamb .
look , when women go out clubbing ,
there &apos;s two ways they can pair up--
pretty girl / pretty girl or pretty girl / grenade .
which do you wanna be ?
fine .
now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
love the plunging neckline .
that &apos;s the back .
ugh . this place is dead .
really ?
i forgot we were in the sticks .
clearly , everyone hooked up early
so they could be home in time for &quot; nightline . &quot;
actually , tonight &apos;s &quot; nightline &quot; sounds very interesting .
it &apos;s about the genocide in r--
hold on .
fresh talent at the end of the bar .
oh , that &apos;s my contractor .
well , call me a fixer @-@ upper .
oh , don &apos;t--don &apos;t bother . he &apos;s , uh , got a girlfriend .
if i don &apos;t see her , she doesn &apos;t exist .
what &apos;s so funny ?
my girlfriend &apos;s about to make a fool of herself .
she &apos;s hitting on that guy , and i happen to know
he has a very beautiful , very young girlfriend .
you talking about keith ?
you know him ?
yeah , and stephanie dumped him this afternoon ,
which is why he &apos;s here , drowning his sorrows .
bree .
i didn &apos;t recognize you .
keith , what a lovely surprise . i didn &apos;t know you were here .
yeah .
but i &apos;m bagging .
i gotta work tomorrow .
boss is pretty strict .
good . i mean , yes , i &apos;m very strict .
see you in the morning .
there ya go . that &apos;s how you bait the hook .
oh , i won &apos;t need a ride . i &apos;m going home with keith .
oh , i don &apos;t think so . he just left .
oh , he &apos;s pulling the car around .
now you think i should play
the &quot; i hate going into a dark house alone &quot; card ,
or the more blatant &quot; i &apos;m not wearing underwear &quot; ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not .
okay , before you do anything hasty ,
he just broke up with his girlfriend . he &apos;s very fragile .
oh . i &apos;ll be careful when i unwrap him .
renee , wait . please don &apos;t go home with keith .
why ?
oh , he &apos;s the one you like , isn &apos;t he ?
i am--i am thinking about you .
you don &apos;t want to come off like a slut .
aw , gee , then chip won &apos;t ask me to the prom .
renee , wait ! what about me ?
oh , it &apos;s getting late .
stay in the dim light and don &apos;t play hard to get .
keith , hi . it &apos;s bree .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re in bed yet ,
but i &apos;m having a bit of an emergency .
oh , thank you . that &apos;s lovely .
why would somebody do something like this ?
far be it from me to understand the minds of hooligans .
i &apos;m so sorry to call you over here at this hour .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
i wasn &apos;t doing anything special .
good .
i would love to show my appreciation .
i was wondering if perhaps one night this week ,
i could make you dinner .
oh . you mean ...
like a date ?
well , we don &apos;t have to put a label on it .
just two adults eating ... food together .
calling it a date is quicker .
well , i see no reason to argue .
shall we say ...
08 p.m. on thursday ?
m @-@ mrs. mmcclusky , right ?
yeah .
i was hoping i might see you at the girls &apos; poker game .
not anymore .
you get caught with a couple of aces in your bra ,
and you &apos;re banned for life . i @-@ i couldn &apos;t help but notice
they don &apos;t seem to like my husband very much .
do you know why that is ?
nope . nobody tells me anything .
mrs. mmcclusky , i really need to know .
okay , fine . they think he &apos;s a murderer .
but he was exonerated .
felicia tillman framed him .
yeah , for that crime .
what do you mean ?
before felicia showed up around here ,
her sister martha was murdered . and , all due respect ,
you &apos;re shacking up with suspect number one .
does everybody think that ?
felicia may be a few fingers short of a high five ,
but if she &apos;s crazy , we all are .
well , that &apos;s enough dusting for today , boys .
i guess all that &apos;s left is a little vacuuming .
ooh ! yay ! get the vacuum .
i think i got some schmutz on my apron .
ooh , get that off .
oh , i love this show . mm .
hello , boys .
for those of you
who might be switching over from other channels ,
welcome .
i have a very dirty apartment .
open up !
uh , little busy !
i know you did it .
did what ? i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , so you &apos;re not just a thief . you &apos;re a liar .
be careful how you talk to me ,
you gigantic freak .
oh , i am about to slap that cheap blush right off your face .
is that supposed to scare me , man hands ?
i &apos;m gonna show you
a whole new place to stick that feather duster .
well , i &apos;m sure wherever it is ,
you copied the idea from watching me .
i need those bonus checks !
so do i !
you don &apos;t get it . i am trying to get out of this business !
oh , and you think i wanna spend the rest of my life
dusting in my underwear ? !
you &apos;re off camera !
roll left .
oh , maxine . i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
what are you doing ?
she attacked me .
that &apos;s because she broke into my apartment and--
hang on . this isn &apos;t a bit ?
no ! i was in the middle of doing my show ,
and she burst in here and started hitting me .
did you do that ?
yeah , but--
you know the rules , strauss !
you never , ever interrupt a show ! now go to your room .
but i--
i said go .
you all right , honey ?
yeah .
all right . good .
i @-@ i gotta call tech support .
you girls had so many hits ,
it fried my router .
so ...
a roving gang of hooligans destroyed your sprinklers ?
shameful , isn &apos;t it ?
you know what i think ?
i think this is the handiwork of a lonely , desperate woman .
you left out &quot; resourceful . &quot;
nobody steals a man out of my bed .
but you know what ? i &apos;ve been looking for a new hobby ,
and taking you down is as good as any .
i think you &apos;d be wise to stick to your original hobby
of forgoing undergarments .
be seeing you , bree .
looking forward to it .
maxine says i can &apos;t go back online
until i apologize to you , so ... i apologize .
wow . and i thought your acting was bad on the web site .
fine . i am sorry , okay ?
i shouldn &apos;t have stolen your bit .
what was going through your mind ?
i freaked out when i didn &apos;t get that bonus check .
see , my family &apos;s in virginia ,
and i &apos;m saving up to move back home .
yeah , well , i know what that &apos;s like .
and even with that extra money ,
i always feel like i &apos;m living week to week .
really ? &apos; cause when i broke in your apartment ,
i noticed that you had some awfully nice stuff .
flat screen tv , closet full of new clothes .
i know . probably shouldn &apos;t have bought all that .
but you know how it is .
every once in a while , you want a little splurge .
yeah , i get that .
but ... definitely by the end of the year ,
i &apos;m going to be outta here .
me , too .
how long have you been doing this ?
um ... gosh . i guess i &apos;m going on six years .
hey , um ... would you mind if we just stayed home
and ordered chinese for our anniversary ?
wait . no suit ?
no tie ?
no pretentious euro waiter listing specials
that i can &apos;t understand ?
dang it , susan ! why ?
seriously , why &apos;d you change your mind ?
i thought you wanted a little treat .
oh . i think we should save that money
and stay focused on what we &apos;re trying to do .
and we can have a fancy dinner and celebrate
when we move back home .
i had a lovely time at the poker game the other day .
really ? what &apos;s the neighborhood saying about me ?
well ...
for starters ,
a lot of people seem to think you killed ...
what &apos;s her name ? martha something .
huber .
i guess felicia tillman spread her poison pretty wide .
i guess she did .
i &apos;m not a murderer , you know .
i know .
but i fell in love with you before i knew that ,
so even if you were ...
i &apos;m always gonna be on your side .
remember that .
everything okay ? you--you look a little ...
it &apos;s been an intense couple weeks .
i &apos;m sorry , buddy .
what if i told you
i could ease some of that stress ?
you &apos;re not gonna offer me a back rub , are you ?
nope .
a mind rub .
so you got this from a doctor ?
really cool doctor .
now i gotta warn you , this stuff is chronic .
i got totally baked off of it this morning .
i did not have you pegged as a stoner .
dude ...
there &apos;s a lot that you don &apos;t know about me .
tom ?
i hate to break this to you , but ...
this isn &apos;t pot .
tell me that in five minutes
when we are soaring past the rings of saturn .
trust me , cheech . this is oregano .
no way . i bo--i bo--i bought it at a legit dispensary .
then somebody must have switched it on you ,
&apos;cause the only thing getting baked with that herb is lasagna .
who would do that ?
you !
oh , jeez . you scared me .
i know what you did .
whatever do you mean ?
oh , yeah . that was me .
th @-@ this isn &apos;t funny , lynette !
tom , you thought you were getting stoned
on a pizza topping . it &apos;s a little funny .
my sense of betrayal is huge at this moment .
well , why don &apos;t you snort some baking powder ?
you &apos;ll feel better .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re enjoying this .
glad you enjoy making a fool of me .
that was not my intention .
i only threw out the pot because i didn &apos;t think you needed it ,
and you know , i was right . you got happy all on your own .
don &apos;t try to justify what you did
by making it seem like some sort of &quot; master plan . &quot;
it wasn &apos;t a master plan .
i lucked out because for some reason ,
while you were ... high on oregano ,
you made a decision to live in the moment .
you stood over our daughter &apos;s crib
and you let go of the stress and the fear ,
and you focused on the good in your life .
but i am sorry i tricked you .
you &apos;re evil . i should have expected it .
where are you going ?
to look at our beautiful daughter .
then i gotta turn that bong i made back into a lamp .
anything ?
we found them .
oh , my god . what &apos;d they say ?
i haven &apos;t called them yet . are you sure you still wanna do this ?
what ? yes , of course .
gaby , you need to realize , once we call these people ,
and they know what &apos;s happened ,
it &apos;ll change your family forever .
call them .
juanita , come in here .
i didn &apos;t do it .
i know .
i was putting on some makeup . i thought you might like some .
can you put the big fake eyelashes on me ?
of course , and ... big rosy cheeks .

to the moon and back .
that &apos;s right .
no matter what happens ,
i will always love you to the moon and back .
hey , carlos , i need to sit down with you and gaby .

i just called the family . it got pretty intense .
what are you talking about ?
and now in a selection from dior &apos;s fall line ,
the world &apos;s newest supermodel ... juanita !
hold the world in contempt .
that &apos;s it .
now you look like a model .
oh , hi , daddy .
hey , carlos . what &apos;s wrong ?
i just spoke to bob .
sweetie , why don &apos;t you go to your room ?
and i &apos;ll be there in a sec .
how could you have done this ?
carlos--
we talked about this ! we agreed .
no , you agreed . you rushed me into signing that piece of paper
without giving me a chance to think about what i was doing .
don &apos;t you understand what could happen ?
she is our flesh and blood , and she &apos;s out there !
i need to know how she &apos;s doing .
i need to know she &apos;s okay !
and what if they want juanita back ? !
they can take her from us .
they can do that now !
they &apos;re not gonna wanna give up their own daughter .
we don &apos;t know that !
we don &apos;t know anything about them !
and you have no idea what you &apos;ve started here !
mommy !
coming , sweetie !
if this ends badly ,
i will never forgive you .
i mean it , gabrielle .
we &apos;re done .
happiness ...
it &apos;s something everyone searches for .
some are sure they &apos;ll find it once they &apos;ve moved back home .
some think they &apos;ll find it by making a new friend .
some hope to find it
once they &apos;ve defeated the competition .
then there are those who stop searching for happiness
because they look up one day to discover ...
it was right there in front of them
