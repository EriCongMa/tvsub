this is my home .
and mine .
and mine .
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ...
witches .
and even hybrids .
and then there &apos;s elena .
she &apos;s one of us now .
she &apos;s strong . if we help her , she can survive .
she can &apos;t even keep my blood down .
our town has always been different ...
stefan , i &apos;m losing it .
feed from me .
but now there are strange things happening
that no one can explain .
nice ink .
what ink ?
you didn &apos;t see his tattoo ?
and there &apos;s a new hunter in town
who wants people like me dead .
don &apos;t bother . it &apos;s a paralytic .
杰里米 · 吉尔伯特
good day for a midlife crisis .
164 years , i &apos;d say you &apos;re due .
elena &apos;s transition to vampire
has been a little depressing .
i &apos;m gonna help her have some fun .
those who can &apos;t do teach .
oh , i see we &apos;re still fighting .
got it . where you going ?
that hunter jacked
tyler lockwood of his werewolf venom last night ,
so basically he &apos;s got vampire poison in a bottle ,
and i &apos;m gonna find him , and i &apos;m gonna eat him .
i &apos;ll go with you .
i don &apos;t want your help .
i just wanna kill this guy and get the hell out of town .
isn &apos;t that the deal ?
whoever elena doesn &apos;t choose leaves ?
that was before she turned .
and i stayed to help ,
but i take you punching me as the first clue ...
i &apos;m not wanted here anymore .
listen , you blood @-@ shared with my girlfriend ,
and i punched you in the face .
you deserved it .
why don &apos;t you stop being dramatic ?
no , brother .
dramatic would be leaving before i kill this hunter .
kind of weird doing this in our old make @-@ out spot .
thank you for doing this .
i can &apos;t keep anything else down .
it &apos;s ok . i kind of owe you my life , remember ?
yeah , but i didn &apos;t make stefan save your life
so that i could turn you into a human blood bank .
elena , please just let me do this for you .
is that enough ?
no .
but if i had any more ,
i &apos;m afraid i wouldn &apos;t stop .
here .
thank you .
so you really think school is the best place for you right now ?
the vampire hunter knows that damon &apos;s a vampire
and that i know damon .
hiding at home would be more suspicious .
besides , i want to be here .
it &apos;s my senior year .
i survived this long .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m bailing before graduation .
town called for curfew ?
tyler got shot in front of half the town .
everyone &apos;s a little freaked .
if only they knew the real story .
who the hell are you two ?
tyler , it &apos;s ok .
they &apos;re here for your protection .
more deputies ?
not exactly .
they &apos;re hybrids .
i was halfway to chicago
when i heard you were attacked .
i had hoped to leave mystic falls for good ,
but duty calls .
nice to know you care .
i don &apos;t . i should have killed you
for the little stunt you and your friends pulled
stopping my heart ,
leaving me in a coffin to rot .
yeah , you used my body as an escape hatch ,
then kissed my girlfriend ,
so maybe we &apos;re even .
not even close .
but you hybrids are a dying breed .
i can &apos;t make more of you ,
and i won &apos;t have anyone taking liberties
with the ones i have left .
consider them your new bodyguards .
so first time we &apos;ve been back
in alaric &apos;s classroom .
the first period , and i &apos;m ready to bawl my eyes out .
morning , everyone .
and just like that ,
i &apos;m no longer feeling sentimental .
so i &apos;m throwing a little anti @-@ curfew party
at my new house .
starts in the fifth period ,
goes to whenever . spread the word .
you &apos;re welcome to join , elena ,
if you &apos;d like to bury the hatchet .
it &apos;s a pretty enormous hatchet .
i &apos;m feeling generous of spirit .
new house ?
did your brother finally kick you out ?
he didn &apos;t kick me out . i left .
so you left the only person on earth that actually likes you ?
your boyfriend liked me once .
actually , a lot more than once .
why are you still in town , rebekah ?
don &apos;t you have anywhere else to go ?
history &apos;s my favorite class .
actually , where is mr. saltzman ?
that &apos;s right .
i killed him .
just breathe . just breathe .
you haven &apos;t felt this kind of rage before .
i hate her .
i didn &apos;t think i was capable of hate ,
but i hate her and hate that i hate her .
that &apos;s the hunter .
what the hell is he doing here ?
that &apos;s jeremy .
no .
no , no , no . hey .
you get this , ok ?
i got that .
there you are .
rebekah sent me to see if you were ok .
i &apos;m fine , heather .
i &apos;m not .
what &apos;s wrong , elena ?
getting hungry ?
no , g @-@ get away from me .
but she &apos;s so delicious .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
this is my school . it &apos;s my life ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let you ruin it .
it &apos;s my school now , my life .
maybe you &apos;re the one who shouldn &apos;t be here .
and i couldn &apos;t help but overhear
that there &apos;s a vampire hunter roaming the hallways .
how inconvenient for you .
see you in gym .
i think it &apos;s dodgeball day .
you mind telling me who you are and why i &apos;m here ?
i &apos;m happy to miss bio , but ...
i looked into your family &apos;s history .
you and your sister have been through quite a lot .
what are you , a social worker ?
what do you care ?
because you saw this .
mm , it &apos;s a tattoo . big deal .
no , i call this a hunter &apos;s mark ,
as in vampire hunter .
uh , a vampire hunter ?
heh . look , i &apos;m sorry , man , but--
jeremy , i know your family &apos;s history in this town ,
so you playing dumb just makes you look dumb .
why the show and tell ?
i don &apos;t even know you .
because it &apos;s invisible
to anyone but another hunter or potential hunter .
find me a vampire .
i &apos;ll train you , teach you how to do what i do .
i &apos;m on hudson , off route 13 .
don &apos;t show up unless you find one .
well , how am i supposed to do that ?
why don &apos;t you start by
asking your friend with the bandage on his neck ?
yeah .
it was a valiant first @-@ day effort .
no one will judge you if you want to go home .
i don &apos;t want to go home .
i want to take the white @-@ oak stake and kill her .
that &apos;s how mad i am .
she made me murderous .
how about we just leave the murdering to damon ?
and--and then do what ? ignore her to death ?
look , she &apos;s trying to make herself feel better .
she knows that everybody hates her ,
so she &apos;s trying to hate harder .
tell you what .
let &apos;s just skip the rest of the day ,
go have some fun . i feel like
this day is severely lacking in fun .
yeah . ok , fine .
we &apos;ll go to her party and show her
that she can &apos;t intimidate me .
i just have to go home and change first .
does she seem a little off @-@ balance to you ?
yeah . she &apos;s channeling all her emotions into rage .
makes her feel like she has purpose .
i used to do that , too , when i was , you know ...
ripper you ?
yeah .
she needs to come to terms with it ,
confront it , let it in before she can let it go .
you &apos;re good at this . you know that ?
you saved my vampire life .
now you &apos;re saving hers .
you should write a book , go on &quot; the view . &quot;
hmm .
so this is where you &apos;ve been hiding , huh ?
hayley ?
hey , lockwoof .
ass . i thought klaus killed you .
i should have called .
from your trailer park in florida . you liar !
you &apos;re totally loaded .
i chained you up all over the appalachians .
i talked you through every turn .
i helped you break the sire bond .
you could have told me your real story .
i didn &apos;t want anybody to follow me back .
werewolves weren &apos;t safe around klaus ,
and you shouldn &apos;t be here either .
his hybrids are all over this house and so is he .
i know . one of his hybrids
is with a pack i ran with .
he called me and told me that he was coming
to protect a guy named tyler , and i thought ,
&quot; what are the chances ? &quot;
well , the least you could do
is pour me some fancy , rich @-@ people scotch .
sure .
absolutely .
why were you being so cryptic ?
come in . close the door .
tell me that is not a bomb .
ok . it &apos;s a kitten .
it &apos;s an adorable exploding kitten .
why didn &apos;t you call your brother ?
because i &apos;m proud and stubborn and--
oh , look . you &apos;re already here .
come on . you &apos;re not gonna get hurt .
all i need you to do is be doctorly ,
cut out the arrow .
i &apos;d do it myself , but if i move ...
psssh !
ok .
ok .
so how well did you know pastor young ?
he was a patient of mine .
he was always a nice guy .
nice crazy guy .
he wrote a letter about sacrifice
and war brewing in mystic falls .
what does he mean , &quot; a greater evil is coming &quot; ?
i mean , we have great enough evil already .
you &apos;d think .
how &apos;d you get stuck on hunter duty ?
stefan had a physics test .
you are a good brother .
i &apos;m the bad brother .
you &apos;re strung up to a bomb
while stefan plays vampire with a girl who broke your heart .
but you are doing a very good job
of acting like it doesn &apos;t suck .
ok , i think that should be good .
hey , matt .
so i &apos;m having a little party .
you should , uh , ditch last period and come .
look , i know you &apos;re still angry
i ran you off the bridge ,
but you have to understand alaric killed my brother .
he was trying to kill me .
i had to do something to stop him .
i never wanted to hurt you .
what &apos;d you say last time ?
hickeys ?
kinky girlfriend .
who you letting feed on you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i don &apos;t know where i got that .
sure about that ?
tell me which one of your high school friends is a bloodsucker .
it &apos;s ...
rebekah .
rebekah mikaelson .
thank you .
when you wake up ,
she &apos;ll be long gone .
hope you plan on cleaning this up .
i need bourbon to get through bekah &apos;s party .
yours is better than stefan &apos;s .
oh . top drawer in the dresser .
thanks .
you keep alcohol in your underwear drawer ?
no .
but you weren &apos;t looking for alcohol , were you ?
do you think i &apos;d actually leave
the last remaining white oak stake
where any vampire could just walk in and take it ?
what happened to you ?
hunter mishap .
you know he was at my school today ?
yep . jeremy told me .
why were you talking to jeremy ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
damon , don &apos;t bring him into this .
perish the thought he might actually be useful , elena .
you staying for the show , or ...
i &apos;m finding that stake .
you got a vampire for me ?
no , but i know where you can find one .
there &apos;s a doctor , meredith fell ,
she uses vampire blood in surgery .
i think she has a deal with one ,
her blood for his .
you see , that &apos;s the problem .
when a town protects one vampire ,
word spreads . more come .
they feed . they turn .
soon you got a full @-@ on infestation .
your high school , for example , is crawling with &apos; em .
one &apos;s even throwing a party .
is that where we &apos;re going ?
nah , we &apos;re going to the hospital .
as long as people are drinking at that high school party ,
i got it covered .
they &apos;ll be dead by sundown .
wow . we didn &apos;t have to be invited in .
i wonder who used to live here .
or who died here .
you &apos;re fixating .
no , i &apos;m just quietly hating .
this is mine now .
thank you .
why don &apos;t you have a drink ?
it &apos;ll help you let go .
april &apos;s here .
i &apos;m gonna go say hi .
and i am gonna find something a little stronger than beer .
ok .
i ditched rebekah &apos;s ditching party .
what &apos;s with all the testosterone ?
hybrids .
i &apos;m on house arrest .
says who ? your mom ? come on . sneak out .
not my mom , caroline .
you &apos;re kidding me .
klaus ?
you &apos;re a new face .
and i take it from your accent
you &apos;re an old one . klaus .
my reputation precedes me ,
hopefully not all bad .
a little bad ,
mostly repulsive .
so you &apos;re a friend of tyler &apos;s .
that &apos;s strange .
he &apos;s never mentioned you .
you should go the party .
i &apos;ll be fine here .
but i &apos;d rather hang with you .
trust me . i am no fun right now .
and i think i know why .
elena .
thank god i know someone .
i &apos;m glad you came . are you thirsty ?
you know , you used to read me bedtime stories .
and now i &apos;m giving you beer .
sounds about right .
if my dad could see me now .
how are you ...
doing with everything ?
i &apos;m trudging through my denial phase ...
dreaming up conspiracy theories .
my first weekend home from boarding school ,
my dad smelt cigarette smoke on my clothes
before i even walked in the door .
he would have noticed a gas leak in the house .
so you--you don &apos;t think that it was an accident ?
i know there &apos;s no investigation ,
that everyone &apos;s calling it an accident ,
but the shooting at the church , it just feels like--
like something wicked this way comes . i know , right ?
it &apos;s like this town &apos;s cursed or something .
hey , april , why don &apos;t you go look around the house ,
and i &apos;ll find you in a little bit .
ok .
did i forget to uninvite you ?
did you blow up her dad &apos;s house
to get revenge on the council ?
i don &apos;t give a damn about some dodgy middle @-@ aged council .
you come into my house ,
throw around false accusations ,
and then you have the nerve to drink my beer ?
my ring .
give it back .
get it yourself .
no !
damon give that to you ?
yes , reluctantly .
stefan , she &apos;s--
she &apos;s not gonna stop .
she &apos;s just gonna keep pushing and pushing .
well , if you want to kill her ,
i &apos;m not gonna stop you .
but , see , here &apos;s what &apos;ll happen .
it &apos;ll feel really good for about 10 seconds ,
and then after that ,
tens and thousands of vampires
all over the world will start to die .
every vampire she ever turned will die .
see , rage is a really powerful feeling ...
but guilt--
take it from me ...
it &apos;ll destroy you .
so you can either go after her ,
or you can get on the back of my motorcycle .
and we can get the hell out of here .
leaving so soon ?
no .
not just yet .
i never got a drink .
now i &apos;m ready to go .
what in the hell ?
she &apos;s quite fetching , that hayley .
where is she ?
oh , she had to run , but don &apos;t worry .
i had her take the back door so caroline wouldn &apos;t see .
whatever you think you know--
i don &apos;t know anything ,
but i &apos;ve put together a pretty convincing picture .
why don &apos;t you tell me where my imagination
deviates from reality ?
you went off to the appalachians to break my sire bond .
there , you met a pack of werewolves ,
begged them for help .
among them was a girl .
she was gorgeous ,
with the same animal instincts as you .
emotions ran high . inhibitions ran low .
stop it .
then , in a moment of weakness ,
the thick sexual tension became something much more real .
i said stop !
and caroline has no idea .
hello , damon .
klaus , where &apos;s tyler ?
tyler &apos;s otherwise occupied
making big decisions about honesty and whatnot .
is there anything i can do ?
i &apos;m going after the vampire hunter ,
so if he &apos;d like to join ...
he wouldn &apos;t .
i , however ...
that &apos;s her .
stay here .
is a hospital really the best place for a germophobe ?
did i say that i was a germophobe ?
sorry .
i meant vampire .
stings , doesn &apos;t it ?
hello , mate .
no .
are you ok ?
stefan .
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
damon said the hunter had werewolf venom .
oh , my god .
you don &apos;t look so hot .
whatever it is , it &apos;s not the white @-@ oak stake ,
so it can &apos;t kill me .
i &apos;m surprised you came to my party .
well , i thought about it .
you explained why you ran me off the bridge ,
so least i could do is explain how i feel .
the truth is , rebekah ,
i think you &apos;re amazing .
you &apos;ve had a thousand years
to learn , to grow , and to start fresh ...
and somehow you &apos;ve managed to throw it all away .
now you &apos;re alone .
you &apos;re compelling your friends .
your brother hates you .
you whine about not finding love .
the reason you don &apos;t find love
is because you don &apos;t deserve it .
keep it up , buddy .
we &apos;ll be scraping you off the ceiling .
you two are gonna kill me anyway .
well , let &apos;s not be too hasty .
i feel like we &apos;re just getting to know each other .
start with the basics .
where are you from ? what do you know ?
maybe you can cue me in on this greater evil ,
because i &apos;ve fought this guy ,
and there &apos;s nothing more evil than that .
yeah , truth be told , i &apos;m as evil as it gets .
i &apos;m not telling you anything .
you think if you kill me , it &apos;s gonna be over ?
there &apos;s another waiting to take my place .
see , this is what i like to hear--
vague threats , ominous prophecies ,
disappearing tattoos .
what do you mean , &quot; tattoos &quot; ?
don &apos;t bother . you can &apos;t see the damn thing .
there &apos;s more to you than meets the eye , isn &apos;t there ?
nice try , but i &apos;m faster than your average vampire .
you &apos;re one of the five .
the what ?
i &apos;m faster than the average hunter .
come on , klaus , where the hell are you ?
why am i thinking about you ?
because you &apos;re a vampire now ...
and part of you knows
you &apos;re a lot more like me than you are like him .
you came .
i did .
and for future reference , one voice @-@ mail
is just as effective as 9 .
what &apos;s wrong , love ?
she has werewolf venom in her system .
you know you &apos;re the only one that can heal her , klaus . please .
and what would you have done if i were no longer here ?
if you and your friends
had succeeded in ridding the world of me ?
let &apos;s play that game for a moment , shall we ?
whatever you want from me--
i don &apos;t want anything from you .
her , on the other hand ...
if you had told me a few hours ago ,
i wouldn &apos;t have cared a lick about her dying .
but as it turns out ...
you may be of use to me after all .
there we go .
way to bail on your own party .
i just-- i needed a minute .
did everyone leave ?
yeah , deputies weren &apos;t actually super happy
about the anti @-@ curfew party .
why are you still here ?
um , honestly ?
um , picking up trash is a hell of a lot better
than sitting at home alone ,
thinking about the family i no longer have .
hey , uh , if you want ,
i could , uh--i could help you look into
what happened with the fire at your farmhouse .
what are you gonna be able to do that i can &apos;t ?
you &apos;d be surprised .
so the sniper was inside ?
yep . still is ,
in tiny , little pieces .
good . i &apos;ll cancel the curfew
and call off the extra patrols .
i can &apos;t say i approve of your methods .
i &apos;ll make a donation .
they &apos;ll name a wing after me , maybe .
see ? i told you i could be a badass .
badasses don &apos;t say that .
doc . nice job .
you told me the plan was to lead him to the storage room .
and we did . congrats .
you left out the part about blowing up a hospital ,
with patients who are sick and fragile
and who don &apos;t need things exploding down the hall from them .
it was contained . nobody got hurt .
come on . buy me a farewell drink .
we &apos;ll talk about what the hell klaus meant by &quot; the five . &quot;
you know you &apos;re not going anywhere , damon ,
and i am not your new partner in vampire crime .
fix things with stefan and elena .
don &apos;t let your pride leave you all alone .
thanks for coming .
not every day i get summoned by a salvatore .
so what &apos;s up ?
do you remember what you were like before you turned ?
mm , you mean an insecure control freak ?
heh . yeah .
you grew into yourself when you became a vampire .
you changed .
and elena , she &apos;s changing , too .
and i want her to be able to enjoy it
without all the guilt and shame that i went through .
and there was a moment today when she did .
and when i &apos;m with her , every bone in my body
tells me to join her , to enjoy it .
but i know that if i do ,
even a little ...
i risk becoming him .
the ripper .
i love her ,
and i don &apos;t want to hold her back .
but you don &apos;t know how to be around her
and still resist that urge .
damon promised he &apos;d help me stay off the edge ,
but , uh , he and i , we &apos;re not in a very good place right now ,
not when it comes to her .
i just thought you &apos;re so good at it ,
at being a vampire .
because of you , stefan .
i &apos;m good at it because of you .
come to me whenever you want ,
and i won &apos;t let you lose control .
elena , hey .
if i &apos;d known you were gonna go to that party ,
i never would have told connor about rebekah .
i already had this conversation with jeremy .
there &apos;s no way you guys could have known that i would go .
i mean , i was surprised that i went .
stefan warned me that i would feel things more powerfully ,
but , matt , the hatred that i felt today ...
i almost--
i almost killed her
in front of everyone ,
in the middle of a party .
that &apos;s not me .
or at least , it didn &apos;t-- didn &apos;t use to be .
honestly , elena ,
rebekah kind of deserves it .
yeah , but it &apos;s not just about rebekah .
it &apos;s about my mind .
i &apos;m having these terrible thoughts ,
these ...
violent images , and i--
it &apos;s all driven by one simple thing ,
this hunger .
hey , elena , you sure you wanna take that much ?
elena .
elena , that hurts . elena .
elena . ele--
elena ! elena .
stop .
stop .
oh , my god .
matt , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so--
i &apos;m so sorry .
i--i didn &apos;t mean to .
it &apos;s ok .
forget what just happened .
you came over , she fed a little bit , and you left .
now go home .
what have i done ?
nothing you should be ashamed of .
you are a vampire now .
you just have to learn the right way to be one .
and i &apos;m gonna teach you .
you saved me ?
congratulations .
you just became worth more to me alive than dead .
what--what did you mean
when you said i was one of the five ?
you don &apos;t know your own history .
well , let &apos;s just say
