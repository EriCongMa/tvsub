did you see it ?
does she know ?
this is the last thing she needs today .
no !
busy day at the dunphy compound .
we have a wedding tonight ,
and this afternoon , claire is debating duane bailey
in the race for town council .
and now the &quot; weekly saver &quot; says
that some voters find claire-- quote--
&quot; angry and unlikable . &quot;
to those voters , i say ,
&quot; wait till she sees this . &quot;
no one can mention it to her .
we can &apos;t have some unscientific poll
shaking claire &apos;s confidence .
phil ...
what poll ?
too late . she knows .
who told her ?
what is this , a witch hunt ?
oh , my god .
i have to go .
well , i just don &apos;t think it &apos;s a big deal .
i mean , how many people read the &quot; weekly ... &quot;
&quot; saver &quot; ?
&quot; saver , &quot; anyway ?
22,000 ... ish .
my company adver--
used to advertise with that newspaper .
and how am i angry and unlikable ?
can i take this one ?
i wouldn &apos;t .
you seem angry now .
i am angry , at that poll .
i think it &apos;s the yelling . i would tone down the yelling .
honey , i don &apos;t yell for no reason .
you yelled at my teacher for calling me &quot; special . &quot;
honey , that was not a compliment .
sweetheart , you &apos;re not unlikable .
thank you .
you just seem unlikable .
but if we work on it , it &apos;s totally fixable .
how ? how , phil ? how are we gonna &quot; work on it &quot; ?
first of all , lose the snippy attitude .
and i don &apos;t know--maybe we could have a mock debate .
oh . good idea .
that way , mom can rehearse her views on the issues .
yeah , and we can point out all the little things
she does that turn people off .
like that look . i would lose that look .
spooky , but better .
第三季 第十三集
all right . thank you very much .
hey , lily ! come here , honey !
hi ! do you know what this is ?
a box .
containing ?
she doesn &apos;t know &quot; containing . &quot;
well , that &apos;s how she learns new words , by us using them .
or , that &apos;s how we lower her self @-@ esteem ,
by bombarding her with confusing vocabulary .
what &apos;s the box containing ?
told you .
okay . it &apos;s your dress .
it &apos;s finally here !
it &apos;s every little girl &apos;s dream
to be a flower girl in a wedding .
it &apos;s lily &apos;s chance to shine .
i was a 3 @-@ time ring bearer .
it &apos;s lily &apos;s chance to shine .
pretty !
oh , no , cam--
cam , she &apos;s gonna look like little bo peep .
or little bo cheap .
look at this fabric . it &apos;s already pilling .
maybe it look better on ?
you mean turned on ?
no , it does not--cam !
i love it !
no , you don &apos;t .
oh , my gosh . are we really gonna let her wear this ?
you know what ? if the bride wants to have a tacky wedding ,
she can have a tacky wedding .
lily will be the bright spot .
literally .
heard it as soon as i said it .
stella !
where &apos;s my good girl ?
gloria , is stella up there ?
no . but i am .
why don &apos;t you say &quot; hello &quot; your wife when you come home ?
well , why don &apos;t you greet me at the door , wagging your tail ?
stella , honey ! where are you ?
stella !
my baby !
stella , i &apos;m coming ! i &apos;m coming !
you okay ? you okay ?
why are you swimming in your clothes ?
because i &apos;m self @-@ conscious about my body .
stella fell in the pool .
it &apos;s my fault . i let her out ,
and then i got caught up in my couponing .
any coupons for swim lessons ?
&apos;cause stella needs some .
seriously ? manny you teach to swim
by throwing him in the pool ,
but the dog gets swimming lessons ?
i gotta say , it was unpleasant but effective .
we have to teach stella how to swim .
otherwise , she could drown .
why don &apos;t you teach her not to jump in the pool ?
she didn &apos;t jump in the pool . she fell in the pool .
why , suddenly , would she jump in the pool
when she doesn &apos;t know how to swim ?
why does she bark at the vacuum ?
it &apos;s a thing . it is never going to play with you .
are you saying that stella is stupid ?
are you covering her ears ?
let &apos;s have a little compassion .
she &apos;s probably still traumatized from her near @-@ death experience .
again ? what &apos;s happening ? !
ay , no !
welcome , candidates . mrs. dunphy ...
thank you for having me .
and councilman bailey .
gosh , thank you so much , alex .
i &apos;m deeply honored to be here ,
and i remain , as ever , a humble servant
to the greatest little town
in the greatest darn--
eye @-@ rolling .
playful eye rolling .
how do we , as voters , know it &apos;s playful ? i would avoid it .
okay . no eye rolling .
and don &apos;t purse your lips like that .
it makes you look annoyed .
and don &apos;t touch your face .
yeah , no face touching . seems nervous .
some of this is subjective .
what ? what now ?
anger .
it looks like you &apos;re scolding us .
i will keep my hands at my sides .
not on your hips . you &apos;re not superman .
can we get started ?
we haven &apos;t started ?
i &apos;ve prepared some questions .
oh , goody ! actual questions .
honk . sarcasm .
just go .
okay , mrs. dunphy ,
why are you running for local office ?
okay , that &apos;s , um , that &apos;s good .
i ... um , i--
mom , you really shouldn &apos;t stutter
over a basic question like that .
you should at least know why you &apos;re running .
i thought the moderator was supposed to be objective .
not if she &apos;s the only one in the room
who has actual debate experience .
now why are you running ?
i saw the need for a stop sign in--
liar !
phil !
i @-@ i just think you should be ready for anything .
i saw the need for a s--
what ?
sorry . accidental buzz .
i saw the need for a stop sign in my neighborhood ,
and although i collected the necessary signatures
and did the paperwork , i found local government
to be entirely unhelpful--
when--what ?
too long . i &apos;m bored .
yeah , next question . i feel like i &apos;m in school .
some say the political system is bogged down
by ideological hard @-@ liners
unwilling to compromise .
how would you respond to that , councilman bailey ?
i would like to use my lifeline .
i &apos;ll take this .
if elected , i would consider all perspectives ,
and i would not ignore opposing viewpoints .
helicopter . just keep going .
i would consider all perspectives ,
and i wouldn &apos;t ignore opposing--
you suck !
luke !
you have to be ready for hecklers .
he &apos;s right .
okay . i &apos;m doing over . no buzzing .
if elected , i--
what ?
too close to the mic .
phil , it &apos;s a hairbrush .
okay .
if elected , i would consider all opinions
and not ignore those of the opposition ,
as councilman bailey has done for six terms .
what ? that was a great answer .
well , i couldn &apos;t hear it
because you were showing me the bad side of your face .
i have a bad side ?
yeah , the left .
no . it &apos;s the right .
uh , dad , it &apos;s totally the left . i mean , look at it .
sweetheart , why do you think i chose my side of the bed ?
okay ! okay . thank you .
thank you , family . this has been super @-@ duper helpful .
hands , lips , sarcasm , eye @-@ rolling ,
wrong side of the face .
oh , yeah . now i see it .
yep .
she &apos;s ready .
and it &apos;s this ,
and it &apos;s this .
not this ,
but this .
okay . okay , that &apos;s good , cam .
and this .
save--let &apos;s save some petals for lily , all right ?
okay . let &apos;s do it over here , sweetheart .
right over here .
okay .
there you go . oh , like you &apos;re coming down the aisle !
not too many at once . that &apos;s good .
okay . you &apos;re doing great , lil .
oh , she is , isn &apos;t she ?
forget the bride . all the eyes are gonna be on her .
i cannot believe you laughed !
i am sorry . but you know i have two weaknesses--
children cursing and old people rapping .
cam , we have to tell her it &apos;s a bad word .
no . that just gives it more power .
the less we make of it , the better .
let &apos;s just pretend like it never happened .
okay . yeah , maybe it-- maybe it didn &apos;t .
maybe we--maybe we misheard .
yeah . maybe she said &quot; truck . &quot;
or--or &quot; duck . &quot;
or &quot; luck . &quot; she could have said &quot; yuck . &quot;
daddy , can i have some ice cream ?
no , honey , if you &apos;re hungry , you can have some fruit .
fruit ? .
i have two children .
phil ? phil , is this televised ?
i didn &apos;t tell you because i didn &apos;t want to make you nervous .
great plan . really good plan .
throw me for a curveball at the last minute .
mom , chill . it &apos;s just public access .
my debate team &apos;s on public access ,
and the only people who watch me are you guys .
yep . all the time .
so maybe nobody will see this ?
no . we want people to see this .
that &apos;s how you win elections . that &apos;s the whole point .
then mom should do something so crazy and stupid .
it goes viral .
mom , please don &apos;t go viral .
okay . i &apos;ll add that to my list of things not to do--
don &apos;t touch my face , don &apos;t roll my eyes ,
don &apos;t point my fingers ,
and definitely don &apos;t go viral .
do any of you still believe in me ?
of course we do . we &apos;re on your side .
the right side .
not the left .
let &apos;s grab a seat .
right . left .
okay . mom , just be confident .
based on what ? i just lost a debate in my living room ,
and people think i &apos;m unlikable .
that &apos;s just the word men use for powerful women
because they feel threatened .
so just forget everything else and be proud and powerful .
how did you get so smart ?
i &apos;ve always assumed adoption or baby switch .
hey . hey . no kisses !
proud and powerful .
sorry .
and no apologizing .
yes ! shut up and get in there !
that &apos;s more like it !
yeah !
oh , god .
there she is .
go get &apos; em , claire .
thanks .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re going to cheer for you
no matter what you say .
oh , good . more support from my loving family .
honk . sarcasm .
why &apos;d you bring stella ?
she keeps getting out and jumping in the pool .
we don &apos;t wanna take any chances because she can &apos;t swim .
then why does she keep jumping in the pool ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about it . i got a theory .
she might be suicidal .
what ? that &apos;s crazy .
there &apos;s not such thing as doggy suicide .
hi . duane bailey .
sorry . i couldn &apos;t help but overhear .
in addition to being a public servant ,
i &apos;m also an award @-@ winning breeder of puggles .
i &apos;ve won the puggly . twice .
and i &apos;m afraid that doggy suicide
is all too real .
it &apos;s just the mainstream media doesn &apos;t report on it ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s not as sexy as feline a.i.d.s.
stella is not suicidal . she &apos;s just ... estupid .
well , that might be part of your problem .
she senses you don &apos;t like her .
you have no idea .
this one &apos;s been against this little angel
from the very beginning .
yeah , well , dogs pick up on that .
you know , they &apos;re very sensitive .
i like to call them , um ...
bottomless pits of need .
but not to their face , though .
that would just destroy them .
not you .
so now this is my fault ?
i think he knows what he &apos;s talking about .
the man won a puggly .
two . i won two pugglies .
we &apos;re done here .
in 2000-
yeah .
do you have any idea what station this is on ?
here , i &apos;ll look online .
it &apos;s a webcast ? that would have been helpful to know
900 channels ago .
no , it &apos;s on public access or something .
i wanna watch aunt claire !
okay . well , first , honey , we need to talk about something .
it &apos;s about that word you said this morning .
what word ?
you know , the one that starts with &quot; f &quot; ?
&quot; flower &quot; ?
no .
&quot; fruit &quot; ?
no .
if she doesn &apos;t remember it , we shouldn &apos;t remind her .
oh , well , she said it three times .
oh , you mean .
cam , leave the room !
no . i can do this .
lily , that is a bad word ,
and you are not allowed to say it ever .
but it makes you laugh .
okay , well , daddy shouldn &apos;t be laughing ,
and you should never say that word .
do you understand ?
maybe .
okay . this is not a game , all right ?
if you say that word one more time ,
i &apos;m gonna take away all your toys !
i &apos;m serious ! she knows i &apos;m not serious .
what about the wedding ?
what if she says it there ?
she &apos;s like a ticking time bomb !
well , what are we gonna do , cancel ? - yes .
maybe we just call and say ,
&quot; we &apos;re not going to any more weddings until the gays can get married . &quot;
oh , so now we &apos;re political ?
we leave town on gay pride weekend
because we don &apos;t like the traffic .
but there &apos;s no substitute for experience .
for example , i doubt my opponent is familiar
with town ordinance 26 @-@ 12b ...
26 @-@ 12b has to do with noise pollution--
something , sir , that you are guilty of right now .
oh , no she di &apos;int !
go , mom !
ladies and gentlemen ...
look at her eyes .
i know . they &apos;re a little too close together .
it &apos;s been bugging me for years .
no , she &apos;s in the zone .
she &apos;s ready for anything .
i do like to talk ... about the issues .
speaking of issues ,
your husband seems to have some .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i &apos;m not sorry . what ?
oh , well , i wouldn &apos;t want to bring it up ,
but since you asked , um ...
in february of last year , your husband ,
one , uh , phillip dunphy , was questioned at a local hotel
for lewd and lascivious conduct .
oh , jeez .
that &apos;s not true .
ma &apos;am , according to this police report ,
he , uh , broke into a stranger &apos;s room ,
stripped naked ...
and then posed provocatively on the bed .
that is technically true ,
but in all fairness , it was valentine &apos;s day .
oh ! oh , i &apos;m so sorry . it was valentine &apos;s day .
i &apos;m not sure , uh ,
if your husband was born in this country .
perhaps he snuck in illegally ,
but here in america , we celebrate valentine &apos;s day
with chocolates ,
not our private parts .
this is my new favorite show .
no , sir ,
he was looking for me , his wife ,
and he walked into the wrong room .
if you believe that ,
i have some talking puggles i &apos;d like to sell you .
do you believe this ?
talking dogs ? i &apos;m skeptical .
i won the puggly . twice .
be strong .
i am glad that my opponent brought this up ,
as i feel that it speaks to his character
more than mine .
i think that we should raise the level of discourse
and get back to the issues
that the voters really care about .
when he was naked , what were you wearing ?
i ... don &apos;t think that &apos;s relevant .
are you sex freaks ?
my personal life has nothing to do with this .
uh--the--my opponent has brought this up
to distract from his own record ,
which shows that in--in six years ,
he has achieved nothing more than writing one ordinance
that allows private parties to have more than eight dogs .
it &apos;s like watching the &quot; hindenburg . &quot;
this is the most horrible thing i &apos;ve ever seen in my life .
excuse me !
stand by .
i am phil dunphy , and i am not a pervert .
i , like a lot of men in this town ,
enjoy making love to my wife .
i mean , um ... i mean with their wives .
not me , them .
look , i should probably just sit down and say nothing .
but it &apos;s too late .
i am standing , and i &apos;m obviously talking ,
and now you &apos;re looking at me ,
and i feel the need to keep going .
first of all ...
no charges were filed .
everyone had a good laugh--
about the situation , not--not about me .
everything &apos;s fine down there .
anywho ...
where were we ?
all over youtube .
we went viral .
some sick bastard auto @-@ tuned me .
i ...
like a lot of men
in this town
i enjoy making love to my wife--wife
and i don &apos;t know how to stop .
i am a pervert .
pervert--per--
jay ! manny !
we should have been there already !
gloria , i &apos;m tying my tie !
i &apos;m accessorizing !
and i thought i was the woman .
the door .
ay ! estella , no ! no !
ay ! no ! no !
estella , don &apos;t do it ! don &apos;t kill yourself !
you are a perfectly fine dog !
i don &apos;t hate you !
estella , okay , i was a little mean to you ,
but that &apos;s no reason to kill yourself !
you are young !
you still have so much left to smell !
ay !
i am--i go !
i &apos;m coming !
i &apos;m--manny !
ay ! come on , estella !
what happened ?
are you okay ?
she did it again .
and you jumped in to save her ?
no , jay !
i wanted to take a little swim before going to the wedding !
get her a towel . she &apos;s shaking like a leaf .
oh , no , no , i meant--
i meant--
thank you , jay .
the dog towel for me .
for the wife .
hi !
hey , guys . hi .
hi . hey , what &apos;s shaking ? what &apos;s cooking ?
you saw the debate , didn &apos;t you ?
the de @-@ what ? no , that wasn &apos;t--
that was today ? no , no . was that on today ?
oh , i didn &apos;t remember .
you are the worst liars .
it was phenomenal television .
oh , lily .
what a ...
dress .
oh , well , you ain &apos;t seen nothing yet .
how about there ... we go .
yikes . she looks like a lite brite .
luke , honey .
lily , sweetie , are you excited to be a flower girl ?
yeah ?
little bit nervous ?
yeah ?
why isn &apos;t she talking to me ? did she see the debate , too ?
nope , she &apos;s on verbal lockdown .
oh ?
she &apos;s been dropping a certain curse word all day .
mm . yeah . yeah , so we &apos;re just hoping
the next one doesn &apos;t happen during the wedding .
if it does , it &apos;ll be the second most embarrassing thing
to happen to our family today .
phil , you said it wasn &apos;t that bad .
that was in the car . we &apos;re in a church now .
honey ...
somebody turn her off . i think i &apos;m having a seizure .
oh , buddy .
oh , good . i thought that we were going to miss lily .
ships at sea wouldn &apos;t miss lily . where have you guys been ?
i had to jump in the pool to save the stupid dog ...
who she loves .
that i didn &apos;t let her down doesn &apos;t mean that i love her .
i barely got manny back in the pool
after that possum incident .
i thought it drowned ,
but turns out it was just playing possum .
yes , papi .
good job !
you know what the worst part of today was ?
i imagine it &apos;s hard to choose .
when everything was melting down ,
i realized i had an answer to your question ,
why i was running .
i wanted to make my family proud ,
and i did the exact opposite .
no .
no , i did . i totally embarrassed you .
no . no , dad embarrassed me .
i was proud of you .
i think it &apos;s cool you &apos;re running for local office .
i mean , it &apos;s totally nerdy , and that &apos;s kind of my thing .
hmm . maybe it &apos;s kind of our thing .
ah . some day , i &apos;ll walk you down the aisle .
if you &apos;re not in perv jail .
please be seated .
friends , family , thank you for making ...
really ?
well , you know i cry at weddings .
oh , no .
what ?
stop--stop crying .
well , just because you have ice water in your veins ,
doesn &apos;t mean that--
no . no , lily ...
no . lily ...
he &apos;s fine . daddy &apos;s fine .
daddy &apos;s not sad .
daddy , daddy !
you see ? i told you it was funny .
excuse us .
congratulations .
there . that ought to do it .. go on , you little motorboat !
look at her go !
where &apos;s she going ?
oh , jeez , i think she &apos;s trying to get herself
sucked into the filter .
what &apos;d you say to her ?
i didn &apos;t say anything !
wait a second .
jay , look .
see ? she was not trying to kill herself .
she was just trying to get to the squeaky wiener !
that must be why she &apos;s been jumping in .
it must have been there all the time . that &apos;s hilarious !
ay , si !
no , it &apos;s not !
not now .
i &apos;m saying it will be .
