well , congrats , and it &apos;s nice
you &apos;re gonna be there for your sister .
yes .
i &apos;m filling in for her husband who &apos;s recovering
from a horrible motorcycle accident .
lucky duck .
wow , so , how long will you be gone ?
well , she &apos;s due tomorrow .
although it did take her six years to finish high school ,
so who knows ?
can i give you a ride to the airport ?
oh , no , thank you , i don &apos;t want to be an inconvenience .
chop @-@ chop , leonard .
we leave in ten minutes .
all right , here &apos;s the deal .
sheldon is gone , so the tree decorating rules
are out the window .
yeah , which means
we don &apos;t have to use his ridiculous
ornament @-@ spacing template .
and i &apos;m happy to report its kickstarter campaign
is holding strong at zero dollars .
wait , so star wars and star trek characters
can go on the same branch ?
i know , it &apos;s crazy .
welcome to the thunderdome , people !
i &apos;ve never done this before .
it &apos;s kind of fun .
yeah , if your mom could see
her little bar mitzvah boy right now ,
she &apos;d have a heart attack .
good idea , i &apos;ll take a picture .
honey , i &apos;m a little strapped for cash this year ,
so for christmas i was thinking of giving you ...
this .
i love it .
okay .
but it is what you got me last year .
and last night .
hello .
hi , stuart .
oh , good , i &apos;m glad you guys didn &apos;t wait for me to start .
although you said 7 : 00
and it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s 7 : 00 , but that &apos;s fine .
oh , it &apos;s probably sheldon .
hi , sheldon .
everybody &apos;s here , say hi .
hey , buddy .
howdy .
hello .
the second i go out of town
you throw a christmas party without me ?
yeah , kind of .
that &apos;s so thoughtful .
you guys are the best .
hey , how &apos;s your sister ?
she went into labor an hour ago .
that &apos;s wonderful . so you &apos;re at the hospital ?
no , she chose to have a home birth ...
because she wants to live in the stone age
and a cave wasn &apos;t available .
you know , many people believe that home births are better
better because the mother is in a warm , comfortable environment
where she can be nurtured by loved ones .
and turn the bedroom floor
into an amniotic slip &apos; n slide .
shelly , come on !
your sister &apos;s fully dilated
and she wants a nice family picture
before there &apos;s blood everywhere !
oh , boy .
i picked the wrong day to wear my good robot t @-@ shirt .
if you were having sheldon &apos;s baby
would you really want him in the room ?
yeah , if he &apos;s in the room when they &apos;re making the baby ,
i &apos;ll give you ten dollars .
hey , i brought over it &apos;s a wonderful life
if you guys want to watch it later .
oh , i love that movie .
i &apos;ve never seen it .
me neither .
it &apos;s great .
it &apos;s christmastime and jimmy stewart &apos;s really depressed
and he &apos;s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself ...
don &apos;t need to see it . living it .
but then he gets to see what the world
would be like if he &apos;d never been born .
hey , you ever imagine what that would be like ?
not being born ?
what do you think ?
what do you think ?
what do you think ?
you make jokes about sheldon ,
but if it weren &apos;t for him ,
i don &apos;t think any of us
would be sitting in this room right now .
really ? sheldon not being here
is the main reason i &apos;m in this room .
it &apos;s true .
none of you would know me .
you wouldn &apos;t know bernadette .
you wouldn &apos;t be dating penny .
you don &apos;t know that .
i &apos;ve been going to the cheesecake factory for years .
i could have picked her up .
oh , you weren &apos;t joking .
no .
okay , sweetie , let me tell you
exactly how that would have gone down .
i &apos;m gonna do it . i &apos;m gonna ask her out .
i &apos;m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples .
sorry , i thought we &apos;re saying things
that are never gonna happen .
maybe this time he &apos;s going to do it .
hope you &apos;re thirsty , here it comes .
watch me .
hey , you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes ?
i , uh , ah , um , i ...
a few minutes it is .
you didn &apos;t ask her out , but that was a lot of sounds .
you guys are making me nervous .
fine , then go talk to her on your own .
i will .
excuse me .
yeah ?
hi , uh , um , i &apos;m leonard ?
really ? you don &apos;t sound so sure .
no , i am he .
uh , any @-@ anyway , um ,
there &apos;s been something i &apos;ve wanted to ask you
for a long time . um ...
what &apos;s that ?
eh , uh , well ,
i was wondering-- if you &apos;re not too busy--
um , uh , if ,
if you &apos;d be interested in ...
... telling me where the restroom is ?
i think you &apos;re too late .
come on , i would not have peed my pants .
she nailed it .
sounds about right .
but , you forget , i did ask you out in real life .
which couldn &apos;t have happened
if you didn &apos;t live across the hall from her ,
which couldn &apos;t have happened without sheldon .
same goes with you guys .
if leonard wasn &apos;t with penny ,
she never would have set you up .
doesn &apos;t matter .
bernadette still would &apos;ve been working at the cheesecake factory ,
and i still would &apos;ve been working this beefcake factory .
you would &apos;ve been all over me .
well ...
hey , penny , can i take that table ?
sure , why ?
the one in the turtleneck is cute .
open wide ,
here comes the happy train .
mm @-@ hmm , chug @-@ a chug @-@ a , yum , yum .
hang on .
you got a ... you got a little something .
never mind .
oh , man ,
that is so us .
you know , maybe you and i wouldn &apos;t be together ,
but you wouldn &apos;t have done so great yourself .
why ?
because i know exactly
the kind of guy you would &apos;ve ended up with .
hey , babe .
hey . did you remember to pay the rent ?
better . i used the money to buy these magic beans .
hey , he may be an idiot ,
but at least he didn &apos;t pee himself .
oh , hold on .
aw , babe , i peed myself .
me , too .
the end .
hi , sheldon .
everything okay ?
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;ve seen things .
lady things .
listen to me .
that is not the way they usually look .
doesn &apos;t matter .
this is no way to make new humans .
people coming out of people .
it &apos;s some kind of dirty magic show .
sheldon lee cooper .
you get back in this room right now .
and bring a mop .
did you hear that ?
a mop .
i have two phds yet somehow i &apos;m the janitor
of my sister &apos;s birth canal .
hey , sheldon sent us all an e @-@ mail .
&quot; happy holidays from texas . &quot;
and there &apos;s pictures .
don &apos;t open them . do not open them .
oh , come on .
childbirth is a natural , beautiful ...
oh , it &apos;s like someone sawed a cow in half .
my father &apos;s a gynecologist , i think i can handle it .
and , now , i &apos;m gay .
you know , i was thinking . without sheldon ,
most of us would have never met ,
but penny would still live across from him .
and with leonard out of the picture ,
we all know what that would mean .
we do ?
hey , sheldon .
hello .
doing laundry ?
of course i &apos;m doing laundry .
saturday night is laundry night ,
and i &apos;m in a laundry room , so ...
i believe your inference is justified .
oh , my inference is justified .
sheldon , you are so funny .
anyway , i need to do my laundry , too ,
because these clothes are so dirty .
almost as dirty as the dirty girl who &apos;s wearing them .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
disagree .
keep going .
so , what do you think ?
a tad asymmetrical ,
but nothing to be concerned about .
please , sheldon . i need you .
to ... what ?
to take me .
i &apos;m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt .
come on , sheldon . you and me right here .
penny , for the thousandth time ,
i &apos;m saving myself for someone special .
perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist
with hair the color of mud .
i think i know how to change your mind .
that &apos;s enough .
i was okay with it .
how &apos;s it going , sheldon ?
actually , much better .
oh , good . is the baby born yet ?
i don &apos;t know . i just got back .
where &apos;d you go ?
my mother asked me to get some towels .
i took advantage of the vague request
and went to bed , bath &amp; beyond .
excuse me ! i &apos;m on the phone !
so rude .
here &apos;s another one . penny ,
if it weren &apos;t for sheldon ,
you never would have met comic book legend stan lee .

great .
at least leonard , howard and i
would have always been friends .
hey , how come you three never got an apartment together ?
we talked about it , but howard was in
a pretty serious relationship with his mom .
i lived with her to save money .
yeah , you didn &apos;t have to buy groceries
&apos;cause you were breast @-@ feeding .
aw , so i guess if it weren &apos;t for me ,
you &apos;d still be living with her , huh ?
not exactly .
what do you mean , &quot; not exactly &quot; ?
well , things would be a little different .
howard , where &apos;s my lunch ? !
i &apos;m starving !
i know you &apos;re starving .
the neighbors know you &apos;re starving .
there &apos;s starving people in africa who know you &apos;re starving !
that &apos;s it ? ! there &apos;s not enough food !
well , you cleaned out earth !
i don &apos;t know what else to do !
how is this any different ?
you didn &apos;t let me finish .
here you go , mother .
you &apos;re a good boy , howard !
such a good boy !
wait-- did she die or did you kill her ?
eh , tomato , tomahto . the important thing is she &apos;s dead .
hey , so how come you two didn &apos;t move in together ?
this guy wanted a place of his own
because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies &apos; man .
yeah , i was wrong .
but i do think you and i would have had a great time .
come on , leonard , dinner .
coming .
hang on .
why would i be fat ?
you &apos;d have no girlfriend to see you naked ,
you &apos;d try to fill the void with food ,
and i &apos;m an enabler who once deep @-@ fried a pancake .
why can &apos;t you be fat , too ?
what do you want to do for dessert ?
i think there &apos;s still half a cake from breakfast .
no , there &apos;s not .
hey , guys .
stuart .
what are you doing ?
i ...
just wanted to be in anyone &apos;s story .
yeah , but why are you fat ?
&apos;cause leonard was fat .
amy , what about you ?
what do you think you &apos;d be doing if you never met sheldon ?
it &apos;s hard to say ,
my life would be so ... different .
you can say &quot; better . &quot; sheldon can &apos;t hear you .
i don &apos;t know .
* happy birthday to me *
* happy birthday to me *
* there &apos;s tears in the frosting *
* happy birthday to me . *
i &apos;ll stop now .
how &apos;s it going , sheldon ?
that &apos;s it .
the baby &apos;s here .
it &apos;s a boy .
congrats .
oh , thank you .
i wasn &apos;t sure i was gonna to make it .
but my mother gave me some ice chips ,
my sister told me to breathe .
and i just thought to myself , &quot; sheldon ,
if you can make it through the green lantern movie ,
you can make it through this . &quot;
well , good for you , buddy .
we &apos;ll let you get back in there .
oh no , no , i &apos;m not going back in there .
that baby is so irritating .
he has literally been crying his entire life .
aw , he &apos;s already taking after uncle shelly .
come on , sheldon , you should go .
why ?
well , you always complain that you never
had an intelligent role model growing up ,
and now you can be one for your nephew .
ugh , all right , i &apos;ll go .
but from what i &apos;ve seen , his attention span
is as limited as his bladder control .
you actually got him to do it .
yeah , you keep saying
how much sheldon has affected all of us ,
but you &apos;ve clearly had an impact on him .
if that were true ,
i wouldn &apos;t still be living alone .
well , not exactly alone .
i do have a 50 pound sack of rice
with one of sheldon &apos;s t @-@ shirts on it .
i &apos;m telling you , sheldon cares for you more than you think .
i wish i could believe you .
i also wish there wasn &apos;t a mouse
living in rice sheldon .
hang on , i &apos;m gonna give you a little
early christmas present .
i &apos;m gonna show you something ,
but if you ever told sheldon
he &apos;d probably never speak to me again .
so , if you want to tell him , that &apos;s fine .
look .
i don &apos;t understand .
he made you his screensaver .
i had no idea .
he is so into me .
wait , wait , where &apos;d i go ?
oh , well , it &apos;s you , swamp thing ,
stephen hawking , spider @-@ man ...
but , look , you &apos;re in the mix .
i am in the mix .
and i &apos;m the hottest one .
who &apos;s that ?
oh , madame curie .
that &apos;s fine , she &apos;s dead .
you okay ?
just really glad you &apos;re back .
me , too .
i got a lot of tv to catch up on .
i missed you .
to quote han solo , &quot; i know . &quot;
did you miss me ?
i would &apos;ve preferred to have you there with me .
oh .
or instead of me .
did you hold the baby ?
i did .
and ?
how did it make you feel ?
looking into the blank , innocent eyes
of a creature that couldn &apos;t begin to comprehend
anything i was saying ?
basically just another day at the office .
i &apos;m gonna do it .
i &apos;m gonna ask her out .
yeah , and chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples .
put up or shut up . you make it , i &apos;ll drink it .
you guys need anything else ?
your phone number and one more cheesecake .
i &apos;m sorry , i have a boyfriend .
in fact , there he is now .
ready to go , sweetheart ?
not until i get my kiss .
