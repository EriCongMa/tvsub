my super @-@ awesome family
was throwing me a surprise early birthday party .
i &apos;m guess i &apos;m the only one at home .
how could you do this ? ! dad !
you were supposed to be my hero !
you let me down !
or i forgot to meet the electrician today
to fix our faulty junction box .
guys , i &apos;m not gonna make excuses .
i &apos;ve been really busy at work .
well , i was halfway through straightening my hair .
and i was in the middle
of doing three weeks &apos; worth of laundry .
and i was actually writing a term paper
right when the lights went out , and ... what ?
this isn &apos;t soda .
okay , before you guys say anything ,
i only put this on because i didn &apos;t have anything --
well , the problem obviously self @-@ corrected ,
which i knew it would .
well , i fixed it .
yeah , mom called a guy .
oh , claire , i &apos;m so sorry . i got busy at work , and --
oh , honey , don &apos;t even worry about it .
i &apos;m just glad the fridge is up and running .
i pre @-@ packed all the lunches for tomorrow .
i didn &apos;t want the brie on the sandwiches to get runny .
brie ?
don &apos;t tell me any more .
i live for the surprise .
hey , mom , i know you &apos;re really busy at work , but --
sweetheart , i would never use that as an excuse .
what do you need ?
the cupcakes for the bake sale .
okay .
oh , and since we got stuck here ,
i couldn &apos;t go out and get
that birthday present for my roommate .
or my dress from the dry cleaners .
done , done , and done .
we have the best mom ever .
hugs !
okay .
wait , wait , guys . guys , dad &apos;s here .
dad , take a photo of us hugging mom .
until now , when i &apos;d screw up on the home front ,
i could always blame work ,
but with claire running a company
and being a better mom than ever ,
i could feel the kids downgrading
their whole opinion of me .
i went from an &quot; a &quot; dad to an &quot; f &quot; dad .
fail dunphy . phil dun @-@ fail .
failip hum @-@ fail dun--
no , i had it before .
say &quot; brie . &quot;
brie !
hey , you know what ?
i could do some of that kid stuff tomorrow .
you &apos;ve got that open house .
honey , i &apos;ve been juggling work and family for 22 years
and just juggling for 30 .
well , i really need that dress for an event , so --
i got it .
agenda for tomorrow -- one dress ,
one set of cupcakes , one present , and that &apos;s it .
i got ya ! you thought i forgot .
i will be here to meet the alarm company at precisely 3 : 40 ...
earlier today .
you didn &apos;t make enough noise last night ?
with all his crying , i didn &apos;t sleep four hours .
i didn &apos;t close my eyes .
it was like being back in my village ,
watching for the marauders .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s more shocking --
you standing watch , or knowing the word &quot; marauders . &quot;
please tell me i didn &apos;t sob all night
just &apos; cause i lost my baby blanket .
shh ! don &apos;t remind him . he &apos;s happy now .
and besides , you didn &apos;t even have a blanket .
we were basically destitute .
what , did you get hit by lightning ?
thank god that joe has a playdate .
vicky &apos;s picking us up .
i &apos;m gonna make him play so hard
that he &apos;s gonna pass out tonight .
well , i &apos;ve got a playdate with johnnie walker ,
so one of us is passing out tonight .
yeah , i know we &apos;re out of dog food .
i &apos;ll pick some up after golf .
she could lose a couple of pounds , anyways .
thank god you don &apos;t have a daughter .
the minute that kid falls asleep ,
that plane goes amelia earhart .
doesn &apos;t this seem a little chintzy ?
yeah , can we go now ?
no , we haven &apos;t said hello to the grooms --
or the talented people who planned this wedding .
another great pepper saltzman production , guys .
oh , please . what &apos;s tackier than a friday lunch wedding ?
table five needs more ... ketchup .
i have to hide my face with a coat
every time the videographer comes around .
in the old days ,
he &apos;d never taken a cheap job like this ,
but the gay @-@ wedding business is drying up .
we do the bargain ones as sherman saltzman events ,
and i haven &apos;t been sherman
since i got on that bus in lubbock 35 years ago .
we &apos;ve only booked two others in months --
adam and michael last weekend
and felix and jordan next monday .
monday .
oh , away , you vulture .
cam , do you think it &apos;s a little weird --
that we weren &apos;t invited to adam and michael &apos;s
or felix and jordan &apos;s ? yes . totally weird .
okay , sweetie , here &apos;s the kid &apos;s table .
where is our table ? there are no more tables .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s us . number 65 .
where are our friends ?
not here .
are we on some sort of gay blacklist ?
i &apos;m not sitting there .
you &apos;re sitting there .
hello .
hey , honey .
oh , cupcakes , present , dress .
i remember . i &apos;m gonna get on that
just as soon as i &apos;m done with my open house .
i just wanted to clarify , where am i getting the present ?
hang on , phil .
i &apos;m in the middle of something .
just one second .
i &apos;m -- it &apos;s at the best buy . ask for s @-@ sean -- stan .
it &apos;s under &quot; dunphy . &quot;
thanks , honey .
i don &apos;t know how you do it all .
love you .
that &apos;s a &quot; t &quot; ?
they say it takes a village to raise a family
and run a company .
turns out , it just takes
one little suck @-@ up from marketing named ben .
oh , claire , i don &apos;t know if you heard .
they moved the kramer meeting back to 5 : 00 .
no .
yeah .
no , i @-@ i have to make a lasagna for luke &apos;s team dinner ,
but i can &apos;t miss that meeting .
you know , i know my way around a kitchen .
my mom &apos;s an alcoholic .
so i could easily knock out a lasagna for you .
ben , you are a lifesaver .
i promise i will not make a habit of it .
i kind of made a habit of it .
calm down .
we only cut two classes ,
and i &apos;ll send an excuse e @-@ mail from your mom &apos;s computer .
i can &apos;t believe i agreed to ditch with you
just &apos; cause you gave me half your brie sandwich .
although that party @-@ crashing apple slice
turned out to be a welcome plus @-@ one .
so we can make it official now .
i have three gay uncles .
yeah , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry , miles .
no , apologize to the guys .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;m too tired to play golf .
damn it ! the dog food !
stella , this is your lucky day .
gloria makes this colombian dish
i loved when we were first dating .
i lied about a lot of things back then .
what the hell are you doing ? !
that takes me three days !
three days to prepare !
and then you say that you love it ,
and you feed it to the dog ?
what else have you been lying about ,
jay kennedy pritchett ?
no daddy kisses till sunday after she eats this .
sorry , vicky .
we have to cancel the playdate .
joe fell asleep in the car , and i don &apos;t want to wake him up .
okay .
thank god that jay was out playing golf .
the last time that i left joe sleeping in the car ...
honey , where &apos;s joe ?
sleeping in the car .
are you crazy ? !
you don &apos;t leave a kid in the car !
why don &apos;t you just put a sign on him
saying &quot; free coyote food &quot; ? !
i have never seen anyone so mad .
even the marauders , you could have a conversation with .
&quot; family emergency . &quot;
&quot; blah , blah , blah . gloria pritchett . &quot;
and send .
i hate that i have to ask this ,
but you didn &apos;t type &quot; blah , blah , blah , &quot; did you ?
you need to chill ...
like my girlfriend here .
nah , i can &apos;t enjoy that .
i just keep thinking about that girl &apos;s father .
could you please just get that off my mom &apos;s computer ?
okay . that was your reward for ditching ,
but if you don &apos;t want to ...
what &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; ?
uh , it &apos;s frozen .
what ? !
oh , my god .
it froze on that ?
hey . &quot; that &quot; has a name .
here , stella . come and get it , girl .
jay , is that you ?
yep .
damn it .
damn it .
damn it !
damn it !
i didn &apos;t hear you come in .
that &apos;s good .
oh , how come you &apos;re home so early ?
too tired for golf .
where &apos;s joe ?
upstairs .
i finally got him to sleep .
she wants to get out .
i &apos;ll take her .
no , no , no . you stay here .
i &apos;ll do it .
no , you can &apos;t .
i mean , w @-@ we rarely get times like this anymore .
joe &apos;s sleeping , manny is at school .
why don &apos;t we go upstairs and --
take a nap .
exactly !
my mom got picked up by a friend .
we can take her car to the computer store
and be back before she gets home .
she left the windows down and the lights on .
sometimes , she is so oblivious .
all i had to do was wait for jay to fall asleep .
genius .
she &apos;d be snoring in minutes . piece of cake .
we are so far away from everything .
during the last toast , i saw them clink the glasses
before the sound actually reached us .
snubbed at this wedding ,
not invited to two others ...
what could you have possibly done ?
sorry . i said i would switch with you at dessert .
oh , pepper . pepper .
do you have any idea why ...
oh , sorry .
i &apos;m in a mad rush to the mashed @-@ potato bar
to restock something called ... fixin &apos;s .
if you ever felt anything for me ,
you &apos;ll push me out a window .
you know , mitchell , m @-@ maybe it &apos;s ...
look . i can &apos;t have this fight again .
i saw you ogling him .
hey , as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
we never have to have this fight again .
mitchell , stop it .
what ?
eavesdropping ?
trolling for business ?
you &apos;ve been doing it
ever since you started handling gay divorce .
it &apos;s kind of ghoulish .
ghoulish ?
yes .
i &apos;ll bet that &apos;s why nobody wants us around .
that &apos;s it . you &apos;re like the angel of death of gay marriage .
you &apos;re like a cat at an old @-@ folks &apos; home
who curls up next to somebody about to die .
they &apos;re judging me ?
felix and jordan sell fur .
sorry . we couldn &apos;t help overhearing you overhearing us .
some friends of ours are breaking up ,
and they need a good divorce lawyer .
do you have a card ?
we couldn &apos;t help overhearing you
talking about you overhearing you overhearing you .
are you really doing gay divorces now ? we had no idea .
i was just overhearing you guys overhearing ...
good lord , it &apos;s like a game of princess telephone .
here is my card , and just to be clear ,
none of you knew i was doing gay divorces ?
no .
oh , interesting .
that &apos;s very interesting . have a good time at the wedding .
well , how about this ghoulish profession
that no one seems to have a problem with except for you ?
look , i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;ve always been a little cynical ,
and i was worried you seeing all these marriages collapse
would push you further in that direction .
no , no , it &apos;s the opposite .
being around all these unhappy couples
makes me even more grateful for what we have .
that &apos;s so sweet . are ...
are you sure that &apos;s not the cash bar talking ?
of course not .
you &apos;re the best thing that has ever happened to me .
and you &apos;re the best thing that &apos;s ever happened to me .
oh , cam .
maybe this is why nobody wants us around
is because we cause an emotional scene everywhere we go .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll never be the son he wants .
what &apos;s to become of us ?
well , now i &apos;m stumped .
yep . that refrigerates stuff .
all of them do .
but you know the saying ...
all good open houses must come to an end by 2 : 00 on the dot .
oh , but my mom &apos;s still on her way .
she &apos;s giving us our down payment .
you knew the rules when you married a drummer .
are we keeping you from something ?
not one &quot; beat . &quot;
i have an idea .
why don &apos;t we greet your mom
with the smell of fresh @-@ baked cupcakes ?
the ingredients are in here .
will , grab a whisk .
i &apos;ll be back before you two are frosting .
i &apos;m on my way to pick it up , stan .
i &apos;ll be there in like 5 ...
to 45 minutes .
okay . cupcakes .
pres ... oh , no . no .
damn it .
the cupcakes burned .
well , it still smells homey .
and it gives mom a chance
to see how well this state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art smoke alarm works !
come with me , mom !
let me show you around the rest of this dream house !
you see , even ironing is a delight here ,
where you can feel a cool breeze
wafting in from the open sliders .
mother nature !
huzzah ! your own gift @-@ wrapping room ,
just like the rich and famous .
sheila , finger .
go right ahead . there we go .
sorry i &apos;m late , guys , but fear not .
one birthday present .
wrapped in baby @-@ shower paper .
one crisply pressed dress .
with one big pleat it didn &apos;t used to have .
at least we know why you were late .
looks like you rescued those cupcakes
from a burning bakery .
don &apos;t worry . mom made those on the off chance
what everyone knew was gonna happen happened .
she also bought me that new dress .
oh , and i hope you kept the receipt ,
because mom bought a backup .
well , don &apos;t be mad at your mom for underestimating me .
oh , how could we , when she made us
this fresh hand @-@ churned ice cream ?
yeah . what ?
oh , you know what we should do ?
we should send her a picture of us eating it .
i guess it &apos;s a good thing i came home when i did .
it &apos;d be better if i did it .
you churned ice cream ?
yeah . did the kids like it ?
they loved it .
great .
but they know i can &apos;t make ice cream .
i bought that churn out of a skymall catalog
after three bloody marys .
it &apos;s been sitting under a tarp in my garage for six years .
you &apos;ve got to dial it way back .
where is this fear and anger coming from ?
you &apos;re gonna get us caught !
you knew the risks when we started this .
i &apos;m just saying we &apos;re getting a little bit sloppy .
all the impossible errands , the fancy sandwiches .
just slap a little tuna on whole wheat
for the next couple of days .
what ? n--
just until things cool off .
all right ?
i was just trying to make you happy .
you &apos;re not gonna stop me , are you ?
coffee cart &apos;s only in the lobby until 4 : 00 .
thank you , claire .
thank you .
this is mortifying .
whoever we ask to fix this
is gonna see what we &apos;re watching and think we &apos;re pervs .
not that guy .
luke ? !
hi , marianne .
you &apos;re so grown @-@ up now .
yeah . uh , this is manny .
marianne used to be our babysitter .
remember when you asked me to marry you ?
&quot; i wuv you , marianne . &quot;
well , nice to meet you . we should get going .
okay . bye , guys . best to your family , okay ?
i &apos;d like to see the look on mawianne &apos;s face
if she knew what a degenerate you turned into .
next .
i &apos;m here , kyle .
hello again .
how can i help ?
what are we gonna do ? mom &apos;s gonna be home any minute .
&quot; hola , papi . have you seen my computer ? &quot;
&quot; oh , sure , mom . it &apos;s over there ,
where that naked girl &apos;s entertaining
her school &apos;s basketball team . &quot;
i &apos;m face @-@ timing alex .
she &apos;ll know what to do .
what &apos;s up , luke ?
computer glitch . the screen &apos;s frozen .
let me see .
i &apos;d rather not .
so porn .
well , i just have to finish this paper .
i &apos;ll call you in an hour .
oh , hey there , cutie pie .
thank you , alex , but could you please hurry
and call us back ?
i was talk--
she knows i &apos;m forbidden fruit .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s half the appeal .
jay !
jay ?
how long since you have been up ?
oh , about a minute before you .
oh , can you do me a favor ?
can you go and look at the laundry ?
i think it &apos;s done .
sure , but , honey , i think i slept kind of weird .
could you run back upstairs and get me my heating pad ?
why is stella going crazy there ?
stella , get out of here !
hi , there . how &apos;s everybody doing ?
what &apos;s up with stella ?
where have you two been ?
is that my computer ? !
don &apos;t open that !
don &apos;t open that !
is that joe &apos;s plane ?
don &apos;t open that !
a lot of unanswered questions here , it seems like .
why don &apos;t we all just ... take a step back ?
nice and easy .
okay , so ...
now i am going to go and take a little walk .
luke and i have some homework to do upstairs .
and i &apos;m going ... to the little boy &apos;s room .
they have taken pictures at every table but ours .
because their photographer isn &apos;t diane arbus .
who else would want a record of this fever dream ?
are you gonna finish this ?
they didn &apos;t budget a staff meal .
it &apos;s our own fault we &apos;re poor .
when we had money ,
we spent it all on drunken sailors .
you mean &quot; like drunken sailors &quot; ?
sure .
pepper , before you run off again ,
why is almost everyone here treating us like pariahs ?
well , you didn &apos;t help yourselves by the cold way
you declined those last two wedding invitations .
we didn &apos;t get those invitations .
i got the rsvps myself
to adam and michael and felix and jordan .
just a big &quot; x &quot; in the &quot; will not attend &quot; box .
no excuse , no gift .
of course you put people off .
it &apos;s just not classy .
how old are these pudding cups ? !
come , carino .
there &apos;s a vending machine in the lobby .
if i lie down next to it ,
will you push it over on me ?
how could we rsvp to wedding invitations that we never got ?
okay , party people , on your feet .
you guys cool if i take off ?
no . sweetie , what &apos;s been going on with you ?
you &apos;ve wanted to leave since we got here .
hey , y &apos;all coming ?
might as well .
come on , lily . let &apos;s go dance .
no ! no dancing . it &apos;s too embarrassing .
no . you &apos;re a good dancer , sweetie .
not me . you two .
what ?
you don &apos;t like our dancing ? why ?
why ?
you &apos;re not good . that &apos;s why i hate weddings .
wait , lily , did you rsvp to some weddings
and not tell us ?
yes . punish me , ground me .
i just can &apos;t watch it again .
oh , you &apos;re gonna be punished .
mitchell , wait . i know how she feels .
did we really embarrass you that bad ?
well , yeah . i mean , i still love you , but ...
why are your shoulders moving ?
well , we always knew there
would be something you didn &apos;t like about us .
we &apos;re just glad that
it &apos;s something we &apos;re so good at .
if anybody asks , i &apos;m with you .
yes , gavin , i got everything you asked for ,
and i &apos;m on my way .
all these errands i have to do for my boss .
i swear , if it wasn &apos;t for me ,
he &apos;d never get anything .
haley , please . i &apos;m trying to figure out
how your mom &apos;s getting all these things done by yourself .
when haley finally gave me a chance to hear myself think ,
it hit me .
could claire be using an assistant ?
i decided to retrace every errand she allegedly ran today
and time it out .
she was in meetings from 9 : 00 a.m. to 1 : 30,
leaving her a 90 @-@ minute window to buy haley &apos;s dress ,
see stan at best buy for alex &apos;s present ,
then speed home ,
where she could start baking the cupcakes ,
drag the churn in from the garage ,
churn , wrap , and frost ,
leaving her a scant eight minutes at school pick @-@ up time
to race back for her 3 : 00 staff meeting .
even if all 14 traffic lights on her route were green ,
this task would be ...
impossible .
i don &apos;t know who made that ice cream ,
but daddy was about to churn up a frosty bowl
of &quot; mom &apos;s a big fake . &quot;
ben , what are you still doing here ?
i &apos;m just making sandwiches for the kids .
don &apos;t worry . they &apos;ll never know .
i &apos;m using store @-@ brand gouda and this domestic mustard .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
my husband could be home any minute .
you &apos;ve got to leave .
what is this ?
&quot; thanks for the advice , mom . it worked great . &quot;
what advice ?
oh , well , you left your phone on your desk ,
and alex texted when you were in that staff meeting .
she seemed really upset , so i took care of it .
it was , like , boy stuff , whatever .
ben , we got to stop doing this .
no , it &apos;s fine . i just said what you would have said .
but i didn &apos;t say anything .
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t there for my daughter at all .
i @-@ i &apos;m so damn busy trying to be the perfect mom
and -- and the perfect boss ,
but i &apos;m outsourcing the one job that means the most to me ,
and i really miss it .
i miss being a mom .
even if i &apos;m a so @-@ so mom
that barely has time to make a soggy tuna @-@ fish sandwich , i ...
then you should get back to that .
yeah .
and i should get back to the office .
oh , no . ben , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s so late .
no , i do .
my mom &apos;s got a &quot; date &quot; with her new boyfriend ,
so i &apos;m gonna crash in the showroom .
thank you .
so , before you open this , i just want to say
this is not the kind of thing i &apos;m usually in to .
let &apos;s not .
it &apos;s all him , by the way .
no kidding .
oh , don &apos;t show it to me !
ctrl @-@ alt @-@ ew .
oh , god . please , tell me it worked .
it worked .
just so you know ,
women are not all vacuous nymphomaniacs
looking to seduce every man that crosses their path .
bye , you dirty little boy !
kind of a mixed message right ?
i &apos;ll talk to her .
