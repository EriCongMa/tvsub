what time is it ?
a little after 5 : 00 .
i forget how long the waiting takes .
here , have some more coffee .
thanks , mom .
what was that ? my watch must have stopped .
run ! run !
keep moving !
when you get to the door , remember ,
they moved everything last week .
head right !
mom ! mom !
mom !
mom !
great news .
you &apos;re gonna get a dishwasher with only one button . yay !
no . okay .
top and bottom rack , regular soil , air --
don &apos;t air .
o-- but it has the little energy saver symbol next to it .
i know , but it takes like nine hours to finish ,
and the sound of the fan drives me crazy .
energy waster on .
it would take less time to wash them by hand .
okay , what ? what is your great news ?
uh , your mother &apos;s cousin carlo called . he &apos;s in town .
how did he get your number ?
i don &apos;t know .
he said he was in the neighborhood ,
and he &apos;s gonna stop by tonight .
here ? !
yes .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
okay , uh ...
call him back and tell him that there &apos;s been another flood
at the dirty robber and ma has to fix it .
no , because then he &apos;ll go there ,
and it &apos;ll be on korsak .
what ?
uh , call him back
and tell him that ma has pancreatitis .
okay , why do you want me to lie to cousin carlo ?
because he got $ 50,000
from falling at a rudy tudy &apos;s when he was 23 years old ,
and he &apos;s been chasing the dream ever since .
he slips , he falls , he sues .
and nobody is safe -- restaurants , families , museums .
okay , well , i can &apos;t call him back
because he said that his phone broke
and he was calling from a pay phone .
of course he was .
okay , we &apos;re gonna have to tape down all the rugs .
ma , did you give cousin carlo maura &apos;s number ?
i would never .
well , he &apos;s coming here tonight .
what ?
i have to say , he &apos;s upped his game a little bit .
okay , uh , i &apos;m gonna get rubber mats
for all these slippery hardwood floors .
okay , wait a minute .
have either one of you ever actually seen him fall ?
this is heavy .
uh , no .
but his taste in italian suits
is way too nice for a guy who doesn &apos;t have a job .
he doesn &apos;t have a job , and he has two lexuses .
or two lexi .
okay .
but it &apos;s highly unlikely
that he would do this in front of his family .
there are like a million other people he could scam .
you don &apos;t know carlo .
rizzoli .
isles .
okay .
ma , you got this ?
yes .
okay .
knives .
noted .
in order to sue , there must be negligence .
and i am many things ,
but negligent is not one of them .
bigger purses than yours have thought the same .
all right , well , have you ever seen
broken feet on the chairs in my great room ?
or glass all over the floor
or a chandelier hanging from a thread ?
no , because that &apos;s not who i am .
i agree .
your house does not look like some weird horror movie ,
but he will adapt .
and precautions need to be taken .
okay , i &apos;ll keep my eye on things ,
even though your mother
is preparing my home for a rizzoli apocalypse .
victim &apos;s helen barnes , 53 .
500 people at this big sale .
nobody saw anything .
our victim &apos;s daughter said her mother
would go big @-@ sale hunting all the time .
wouldn &apos;t be the first experienced shopper
to be taken out by a crowd .
no , but that &apos;s not how she died .
there &apos;s a wound on her lumbar region .
she was stabbed .
stabbed ?
for a five @-@ second advantage to get in the store ?
what ? someone just had to get their hands on the last blender ?
well , they don &apos;t let you bring blenders into jail ,
so that hardly seems worth it .
maybe she was targeted .
all right , we &apos;re gonna need the store &apos;s security footage .
i &apos;m on it .
makes me want to give up going to malls .
you don &apos;t go to malls .
mission accomplished .
good lord .
it &apos;s worse than kenmore square when the sox won the series .
i can barely make anyone out .
there .
i didn &apos;t see anyone stab her .
must have happened right before she entered this camera angle .
let me back it up a little bit .
hey , can you play it half speed ?
freeze it . look at him .
that guy .
see how he looks over his shoulder ?
he &apos;s not too interested in the store , is he ?
i &apos;ll isolate him and run facial recognition .
yeah .
i &apos;m very sorry for your loss .
thank you .
she was a wonderful woman .
passionate about deals --
finding them , getting them .
if she was so good at finding deals ,
do you think any of her fellow shoppers
might have held a grudge against her ?
no , it wasn &apos;t like that .
we &apos;d see the same faces over and over .
getting a doorbuster item was like a game .
there &apos;s no animosity in the community .
have you ever seen this man ?
no .
is that who killed my mom ?
i don &apos;t know .
why would he do that ?
why would he kill my mother ?
korsak &apos;s still in with the victim &apos;s daughter .
well , we just i.d. &apos; d the guy from the best lots .
his name &apos;s elliot dutton .
uniforms went to his house , but he wasn &apos;t there .
anything from the background check ?
no , nothing helpful .
he &apos;s a bookkeeper -- clean .
you know , maybe we &apos;re reading too much into this video .
we see a killer looking around for witnesses ,
but maybe this is just a guy
going back to his car for his wallet .
elliot dutton just used his credit card
to buy a ticket on a bus leaving from boston west .
or not .
thanks .
all passengers , please have your tickets readily available
to show the driver .
thank you .
elliot dutton ?
stop ! police ! wait , wait ! hey , hey !
thank god you &apos;re here . oh , my god .
he &apos;s chasing me , please . y @-@ y @-@ you have help me .
okay , okay , calm down . who is chasing you ?
my boss . he wants to kill me .
he just yelled my name . didn &apos;t you hear him ?
that was me , mr. dutton .
you ?
i just yelled your name .
you come at --
suit and tie , hair -- you called my name , right .
you called my name .
all right .
uh , he called your name , yeah .
why don &apos;t you just , uh , come with us ? come on .
why did you take my clothes ? i didn &apos;t do anything ?
then why did you run ?
like i said , i thought my boss was chasing me .
this woman was stabbed outside of the best lots today .
we have video of you running from her body .
what ? i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i wa-- my boss , he attacked me at our office ,
and i was running away to avoid being killed .
so , you knew that large crowd was gonna be there .
yeah , best lots is near where i work .
i arrive early on sale days to avoid traffic .
i wouldn &apos;t hurt anyone .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to figure out if i know her .
i have , uh , trouble recognizing people &apos;s faces .
it &apos;s called facial recognition blindness .
really ?
yeah .
if you were to walk away ,
i wouldn &apos;t recognize you when you came back .
must make it hard to differentiate
between good people and bad people .
it does .
does that make you nervous ?
all the time .
you know , if i was in your situation , i might carry a knife , too .
i don &apos;t carry a knife .
i didn &apos;t stab anyone .
i &apos;ll be right back .
where &apos;s she going ?
it &apos;s a real thing -- prosopagnosia .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s not a real thing .
fear of spiders -- that &apos;s a real thing .
hot dogs -- those are real things .
hot dogs are barely a real thing .
maura .
so , what happens is the part of the brain
that distinguishes facial features doesn &apos;t work .
people like you and me ,
we take a mental picture of someone ,
and we store it in our minds .
prosopagnosics , they take a picture ,
and then they throw it away .
they don &apos;t even recognize their parents .
it feels like a silver lining there .
but his mother probably is nothing like my mother .
in order to cope , people with this condition
find other ways to tell people apart .
their build , hair , their voice .
2 % of the population actually has it in some capacity .
okay , fine , it &apos;s a real thing .
but he &apos;s probably lying about having it .
did you find any blood evidence on his clothes ?
uh , no , they are still being processed .
oh , you know , there are prosopagnosia research centers
at dartmouth , harvard , and university college london .
gosh , i would love to escort him to london
to have him checked out ,
but i feel that might stall our investigation .
give me your lab coat .
no .
why are you looking at my lab coat ?
that &apos;s you , correct ?
that &apos;s the jacket i was wearing .
do you understand why we &apos;re concerned
since you &apos;re standing right next to a woman who was just stabbed .
yes .
and if any of her blood is on your clothes ,
it might be enough to put you away .
now are you sure you don &apos;t want to tell me something else ?
i didn &apos;t kill her .
i @-@ i was running for my life .
from the boss who was attacking you for no reason .
yes .
excuse me .
oh , this is dr. kepley .
she &apos;ll be consulting on this case .
we &apos;d like you to take a look at some pictures .
we &apos;re hoping that
you recognize one of these men from the crime scene .
i don &apos;t -- i -- - take your time .
i don &apos;t recognize any of them .
are you sure .
i &apos;m sorry .
seriously ?
it &apos;s pictures of the same two guys .
one of them is sitting right in front of you .
detective rizzoli ?
there was no blood on elliot &apos;s clothes or hands ,
which there should have been given his proximity .
so he didn &apos;t stab helen .
facial recognition blindness -- now i &apos;ve heard everything .
happy to learn about it , glad i don &apos;t have it .
admit it -- you &apos;d miss my face .
if we believe him , elliot was the target .
helen was just collateral damage ,
which makes him a material witness .
worst witness ever .
i guess it &apos;s like dealing with a masked attacker .
what do we know about this boss who was chasing him ?
franklin simms .
owns a chain of dry cleaners --
17 locations throughout the city ,
no history of violence , no criminal record .
nina couldn &apos;t find him in any of the footage of the stampede .
but it &apos;s a stampede .
helen was stabbed
in her lower back near the l1 vertebra .
that &apos;s an unusual place to be stabbed .
unless you &apos;re chasing someone through a crowd ,
trying desperately to kill them before they get away .
don &apos;t you hate it when that happens ?
guess we ought to go find him .
okay .
you know , even if i had prosopagnosia ,
i &apos;d still be able to recognize you .
nobody in the department has a mane like that .
oh , thank you .
no , that person i do not know .
don &apos;t tell anybody i did that , all right ?
i don &apos;t even want to remember it .
korsak .
found him .
five wounds , all concentrated to his torso .
is it the same knife that killed helen ?
well , it appears that the apex of the incised wounds
is indeed rough and uneven ,
which would be consistent with what helen suffered .
&quot; indeed &quot; is close to &quot; yes , &quot; right ?
yes , adjacent .
okay , so , from this point of view ,
you can &apos;t see the body .
so , elliot comes in ,
he sees a guy in a suit and thinks that it &apos;s simms ?
well , if the killer had brown hair and wore a suit ,
in the frenzy of an attack , it would be an easy mistake
for somebody with prosopagnosia to make .
elliot came in early because of the sale .
killer didn &apos;t expect him .
so simms was the killer &apos;s target .
and elliot was his hapless , not really an eye @-@ witness .
that bric setup is impressive .
yeah , we &apos;ve made a lot of improvements this year .
i haven &apos;t seen you around .
detective ... ?
fordham .
i just transferred here . i &apos;m on the second floor .
uh , welcome .
i &apos;m happy to answer any questions you might have .
thanks .
i &apos;ll try and carve out some time .
yeah , any time .
you can always find me right over --
uh ... excuse me .
i got to get this .
hi , ma .
hey , frankie ?
hey , i really need your help .
cousin carlo is coming over to maura &apos;s .
what ? why ?
yeah , i know . it &apos;s terrible .
he said he wants to see me .
did you try to cancel ?
yes , but he &apos;s incommunicado .
all right , are you getting the house ready ?
of course .
but i needed more floor mats ,
and there &apos;s an accident on 90 .
listen , frankie , i need you
to get to the house in case i &apos;m late .
we can &apos;t leave maura there alone with him .
no , i &apos;m really busy today , mom . i can &apos;t leave .
oh , come on . that &apos;s what janie said , damn it .
i need a rizzoli there at all times in that house .
whoa ! wh--
what just happened ?
maura &apos;s new car just saved my life .
well , not my life , but still -- listen , frankie .
damn it , i need somebody to be at the house .
ma , ma , i got to go , okay ?
good luck . i love you .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
don &apos;t i kind of stand out among all these old people ?
bpd has an apartment at lavintman &apos;s for years .
we &apos;ve never had a problem .
the guy who &apos;s looking for you
is gonna look in a lot of different places
before he looks in an assisted @-@ living facility .
we have department approval to keep you here for 48 hours .
you &apos;ll be guarded by a rotation of officers .
this is -- uh , sir ?
sorry . officer mekler .
officer mekler will be here to 8 : 00 p.m.
he &apos;ll be replaced by someone new .
um , officer , could you keep your hat on ?
that &apos;ll help mr. dutton recognize you .
no problem .
thank you .
you &apos;re only gonna protect me for 48 hours ?
well , two days is a long time in an investigation .
i don &apos;t why mr. simms attacked me .
but if you can &apos;t find him ,
what &apos;s to keep him from trying again ?
mr. simms didn &apos;t attack you .
what ?
elliot , mr . simms is dead .
he was killed this morning before you went into the office .
h @-@ he didn &apos;t try to kill me ?
no .
of course .
why would he try to kill me ?
i can &apos;t believe i thought he was chasing me .
why don &apos;t you tell us everything
you can remember about this morning ?
i just -- can i have a minute ?
yeah , sure .
i &apos;ve always loved jazz , you know ?
i live down the street from chick corea in chelsea .
he played my 16th birthday party .
really ? oh , that must have been very special .
there you go , maura .
thank you , carlo .
so , angela is stuck in traffic .
she should be here any moment .
all those mats in the kitchen -- you must do a lot of cooking .
uh , well , uh , even for wood floors ,
french oak is so unforgiving .
so , what do you do for a living ?
music .
oh , you play ?
trumpet , but i mostly teach .
i love the trumpet .
such a heraldic instrument .
yeah , i &apos;d like to play more ,
but had to give up the dream in order to survive .
oh , god , i &apos;m so sorry i &apos;m late .
angela , sweetheart !
you look fantastic .
come here . come here .
nice to see you , carlo .
yeah , yeah , you too , honey .
i will leave the two of you to catch up .
before we sit down , i need to use the restroom .
it &apos;s broken .
the downstairs ?
well , there &apos;s another one just up the stairs .
not the stairs .
angela .
maura .
you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
frankie did fix the bathroom downstairs .
it &apos;s right through there .
thank you .
socks . you let him wear socks ?
do you want to be homeless ?
hey , angela ? we are having a lovely time .
he has no reason to have an accident .
he does work , you know .
the trumpet ?
yeah , he blows a lot of hot air .
no , he teaches now .
yeah , i don &apos;t know about that .
angela , when is the last time you saw cousin carlo ?
a couple of christmases ago .
exactly .
so , maybe he &apos;s outgrown his problem .
the tile work in here is lovely .
oh , the night is young .
hey , jane .
how did you know it was me ?
one leg is longer than the other .
longer .
one heel hits harder .
okay .
we need to talk about the case .
you want me to help you find a man i can &apos;t recognize
who &apos;s trying to kill me for a reason i don &apos;t know .
elliot , you have to remember something
and you never know what could help .
but when i &apos;m stressed out ,
the techniques i use to get through the day ,
they don &apos;t work very well .
you mean like remembering hair or jewelry
or weird leg length ?
right .
my mother --
she , uh , wore the same kind of clothes .
she never changed her hair .
but still , sometimes when i saw her out in the neighborhood ,
i wouldn &apos;t even know who she was .
is this condition the reason
that you &apos;ve lived in the same place for 15 years ?
uh , i change as little as i can --
same apartment , same to work ,
same stores .
same people know you .
at least the people that think i &apos;m stupid or rude --
it &apos;s the same group of people .
i , um ...
i dream of going to other places .
yeah ?
yeah .
where do you dream of going ?
don &apos;t laugh .
i will not .
norway .
really ?
i want to see fjords .
what &apos;s gonna happen when my 48 hours are up ?
well , why don &apos;t we address that when we get to it ?
that woman is dead
because i couldn &apos;t tell the difference
between a killer and a man i &apos;d worked with for six years .
elliot , you have a medical condition .
you couldn &apos;t help it .
i just don &apos;t want anyone else to get hurt .
okay , well , let &apos;s agree on nobody else gets hurt .
that includes you .
that is nice of you to say .
but the truth is , if anything happened to me ,
no one would even notice .
what do you got ?
elliot may have facial recognition problems ,
but he also may have bullshit recognition problems .
there &apos;s a piece missing from his books . look .
25 % of the company &apos;s annual income
is paid to &quot; dividends . &quot;
this year , that amounted to $ 750,000 .
pretty nice little payout . what &apos;s the problem ?
it &apos;s all paid in cash ,
and there are no corresponding
accounts indicating where it &apos;s going .
nothing ?
just says &quot; dividends . &quot;
we didn &apos;t find any tax records in his office , did we ?
no .
and it &apos;ll take the i.r.s. a year to comply with a subpoena .
well , let &apos;s get jane to ask elliot what he knows about it .
hey , jane .
i was trying to walk really evenly .
even without the walk , there &apos;s the hair .
nothing gets past you , huh ?
how was your night ?
old people snore .
yeah .
elliot , we need to talk about villa &apos;s finances .
is there a problem ?
the dividend payout --
three quarters of a million dollars last year .
you have any idea where that was going ?
no .
elliot , i can &apos;t help you if you don &apos;t tell me the truth .
i was just the bookkeeper .
i didn &apos;t do corporate filings or taxes .
but that doesn &apos;t mean you didn &apos;t know something was going on .
the cleaners had a really high number of cash transactions .
i thought there should have been more credit cards .
did you ever say anything about it ?
it &apos;s hard to keep your job when you can &apos;t recognize your bosses .
i decided i would not ask any questions
so simms would look the other way on my thing .
did you ever notice anything
out of the ordinary in any of the shops ?
no , but i &apos;ve only been to the one near my house .
they never asked you to pick up any receipts or deposits
at any of the other locations ?
simms did that himself .
i always thought he was just being nice
because he knew i was uncomfortable being out in the world .
that wasn &apos;t it , was it ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
i &apos;ll come check on you later , okay ?
okay .
all right , hang in there .
jane &apos;s right -- there &apos;s more to mr. simms &apos; reluctance
to let elliot see the cleaners than just kindness .
four years ago , villa cleaners began expanding
and acquired these six properties .
they added four locations a year after that .
i pulled these pictures from an online mapping program .
are you sure the addresses are right ?
i drove by that one myself just to make sure .
there &apos;s no way they were pulling in
that much revenue from just six legitimate locations .
they must be laundering money .
that &apos;s why most of the transactions are in cash .
this location had a fire yesterday ...
just a few hours after helen was murdered .
well , that &apos;s a little coincidental .
killer &apos;s a step ahead of us .
detective kain ?
yeah .
vince korsak . we spoke on the phone .
this is detective rizzoli .
nice to meet you both .
you said this property was linked to a homicide investigation ?
yeah , you mind if we take a look ?
no , come on in .
we already finished our investigation .
it was definitely arson .
dog sniffed accelerant right away .
seems like some kind of makeshift office here .
receipts in the garbage indicate
they &apos;ve been here a few months at least .
thank you .
yeah .
hard drive &apos;s been drilled -- useless .
they &apos;re hiding something .
amateurs .
what do you got ?
they didn &apos;t stir the embers .
we may still be able to figure out what they were up to .
what are you doing ?
how did you know it was me ?
you were clomping .
you recognized my clomping ?
no , i heard clomping , i looked up ,
and i saw my best friend being weird .
did you know that i have one leg that &apos;s longer than the other ?
really ?
that &apos;s what elliot
the propis @-@ fuh @-@ fuh told me after hearing me walk .
he has a very strong ear .
it is common with that condition .
you should get that looked at .
i don &apos;t want to get it looked at .
well , it could cause damage to you back over time .
simple enough to lengthen the other leg .
i don &apos;t need to be taller , maura .
men are already afraid of me enough as it is .
and you think it &apos;s because you &apos;re tall ?
that was a good one .
i heard it went well with cousin carlo last night .
it did .
good , i &apos;m glad .
although , i didn &apos;t expect anything less .
all right .
well , i &apos;ll see you later .
you didn &apos;t have to give me gelato .
well , after what i did to your house ,
i felt you deserved it .
well , i &apos;m not gonna say no to pistachio .
who &apos;s that ?
did you order in ?
no .
janie , thanks for running over .
but i think maura was right .
he &apos;s changed .
you don &apos;t think this is some kind of play ?
no .
janie ! hey .
hey , carlo .
janie , it &apos;s so good to see you .
i &apos;m so glad you stopped by .
how have you been ?
busy .
oh , well , busy looks good on you .
yeah , thank you .
zeppole &apos;s ready .
wh-- you made zeppoles ?
i didn &apos;t know if i was gonna see you ,
so i wanted to make something that could travel .
and i know you love my zeppole .
can i have 10 ?
coming right up .
he must be medicated .
well , it &apos;s probably better for all of us .
um ... are we okay
that he &apos;s working with boiling oil ?
come on , he &apos;s fine .
and if he was what you say he was ,
then he certainly doesn &apos;t fit that description anymore .
and i did take some precautions .
godere questo bellisimo desserto de zeppole .
ooh . ooh , they look great .
thank you , carlo .
of course .
you know what ?
i think we could use a little more powdered sugar .
i told you so .
don &apos;t you &quot; i told you so &quot; me !
oh , i will &quot; i told you so &quot; you as long as i &apos;m right .
what ? that doesn &apos;t even make sense .
okay , what are you , 12 ?
hm , looks like we spilled a little -- whoa !
oil .
has he called yet ?
nope .
he &apos;ll call .
we will deal with it if he does .
what do we got here ?
using this ultraviolet , infrared dslr camera ,
we take pictures of the burnt paper .
the computer analyzes the image ,
and we can , up to 70 % of the time ,
bring up whatever is underneath the burn .
some fancy camera .
anything interesting yet ?
primarily receipts and pay stubs .
i &apos;m not sure what this fire was supposed to be covering up .
well , we think they were laundering money .
creating receipts helps the income look legitimate .
maura , this says &quot; i.r.s. &quot;
right here , maura , can you process this one right now ?
sure .
&quot; audit requires all records for villa cleaners
and its shareholders , including koko inc . &quot;
that &apos;s some magic camera you got there .
thanks , maura .
so ?
koko inc . is a shell corporation
that is wholly owned by mary ann wilkhousen .
she &apos;s a lawyer .
everything about her and her corporation is legitimate .
mary ann wilkhousen ?
when i was in the organized crime unit ,
she worked as an attorney for spencer romero .
i think they had more than just a working relationship .
wait , spencer romero ?
the spencer romero ?
who &apos;s that ?
oh , he &apos;s a thuggish drug dealer from the east side .
bpd suspects him in at least 10 murders ,
but he does the jobs himself .
there &apos;s never anyone to flip to convict him .
i &apos;ll bet he &apos;s the source of the cash villa &apos;s been laundering .
simms must have panicked when he got the notice from the i.r.s.
he told romero
and romero killed him to get rid of loose ends .
okay , but how do we pin on him
with our witness who isn &apos;t really a witness ?
we think that this man is associated with mr. simms .
does he look familiar in any way ?
not really . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
uh , let &apos;s -- let &apos;s just watch this .
so , we &apos;re just looking to take a few kilos off your hands .
for how much ?
we &apos;re good with the usual rate .
get out of here . you think i &apos;m an idiot ?
anything about his mannerisms ?
nothing .
i don &apos;t recognize him . i want to help .
okay , elliot .
just -- you do this every day , okay ?
you recognize people by characteristics that other people don &apos;t see .
you lived your whole life this way , so just ...
calm down .
i &apos;ve got all day .
okay , uh , play it again .
okay .
so , we &apos;re just looking to take a few kilos off your hands .
for how much ?
we &apos;re good with the usual rate .
that last bit -- play it again .
okay .
we &apos;re good with the usual rate .
that clicking .
that &apos;s mr. wilkhousen .
wilkhousen .
yeah , he came around a bit .
he always smelled like he came straight from a hookah bar .
okay .
okay , elliot , that &apos;s great . that &apos;s all i needed .
is mr. wilkhousen selling drugs ?
because i never saw anything like that at the office .
i &apos;m sorry , elliot ,
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t really say anything about the case .
who is he ?
i have a right to know what i &apos;m dealing with here .
okay .
his real name is spencer romero .
but elliot , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s really all
that i can tell you , okay ?
and -- and i just --
i don &apos;t want you to worry about anything , all right ?
you &apos;re very safe here .
i thought i have to leave after 48 hours .
i &apos;m working on that , too .
okay .
okay .
thank you . thank you .
romero was in their office . elliot i.d. &apos; ed him .
visiting the office isn &apos;t a crime .
but as a witness for simms &apos; murder ,
defense attorney would have field day with his facial blindness .
what if we got romero on tax evasion and money laundering ?
i mean , we &apos;ve got the burnt receipts ,
we &apos;ve got elliot &apos;s books .
that might work .
with elliot &apos;s extensive knowledge of villa &apos;s accounting ,
could be enough to bring romero down .
i mean , the charges aren &apos;t sexy ,
but they worked on capone .
would this be enough to get elliot
more permanent protection while we work on romero ?
i &apos;ll call upstairs .
half a witness against romero is better than none .
right , i &apos;ll go tell him
we might be able to buy him some more time .
he &apos;s in the can .
thanks for the report .
ew , it really does smell like old people in here .
yeah , you get used to it .
how long has he been in there ?
i don &apos;t know . a while .
elliot ?
elliot , it &apos;s jane . you all right ?
shit .
he &apos;s gone .
what ?
what happened ?
uh , nothing . - no , not nothing -- something .
uh , used my phone to check the score of the game .
he said he had to use the bathroom .
give me your phone .
shit !
he hasn &apos;t used his credit cards
or taken cash out of an atm .
should have confiscated his wallet .
frankie said elliot &apos;s not at his house ,
but it looks like he was there recently .
well , he &apos;s spooked ,
so he &apos;ll try and get as far away as he can .
if we can just find him ,
bpd is willing to keep him in a safe house
until we nail romero .
he probably knows we can keep him from
boarding a plane , right ?
yeah , and he doesn &apos;t own a car . it leaves trains and buses .
he still has that unused bus ticket .
i &apos;ll check out the buses .
i &apos;ll check inside .
all southbound passengers ,
please proceed to line 2 at gate 1 .
elliot .
it &apos;s jane .
we got to get you out of here .
no . i &apos;ve got to get out of boston .
i can keep you safe .
he could be anywhere .
listen to me , okay ? you &apos;re not alone .
the department can put you some place safe
while we deal with romero .
okay , you don &apos;t have to run away .
what if you can &apos;t deal with him ?
i can deal with him .
hey , korsak , i got elliot with me .
uh , we &apos;re outside . just meet us at the car , okay ?
that hookah bar smell .
what ? here ?
spencer romero ! police !
you good ?
ask detective dutton .
detective ?
i didn &apos;t think screaming , &quot; hey , stop ,
i &apos;m the guy who can &apos;t really recognize you . &quot;
would be much help .
janie .
what are you doing here ?
well , maura had said that you called ,
so i came to say goodbye .
wonderful .
may i ?
please .
food good here ?
oh , cut the crap , carlo .
look , you may have gotten away
with suing the funeral parlor at aunt josie &apos;s funeral
and mysteriously cutting your fingertip off
with a ladder at kay &apos;s hardware ,
but you and i both know your neck is fine .
all right ?
really ? with the cervical collar ?
come on !
jane .
we &apos;re family .
maura is family .
and when her father started causing problems , i shot him .
i understand that you have doubts , jane ,
but my neck does hurt .
and maura has insurance .
she &apos;ll be fine .
you &apos;re an embarrassment to this family . you n --
jane . i didn &apos;t expect to see you .
yeah , i was just having a little chat with carlo .
okay , carlo .
after you called , i wanted to meet with you
and give you a chance to do the right thing .
what can i say ? i hurt my neck .
okay .
see you at christmas .
don &apos;t threaten me .
ehh , nice job with the hidden camera .
well , i am trusting , but i &apos;m not stupid .
well , why didn &apos;t you tell me you put one up ?
because i wanted to be right about him .
it &apos;s not easy to admit that i &apos;m right .
sometimes .
all the time .
okay , a lot .
you know , slip @-@ and @-@ fall scam artists
typically work in teams .
he was very talented .
can &apos;t even believe you &apos;re giving him props .
i &apos;m just saying artists come in all forms .
are you are eating purse zeppole ?
he does do one thing right .
give me one .
these are really just italian doughnut holes .
how dare you ?
i &apos;m not saying they &apos;re bad .
not bad ?
you don &apos;t deserve them . give them to me .
no , no way . i saved them .
give them to me .
you are staring at me like that again .
i dare you to blink .
blink .
blink .
if you squint really hard like this , you don &apos;t blink .
blink .
oh , god .
so easy .
don &apos;t eat all of them , please .
i &apos;m going to eat all of them .
