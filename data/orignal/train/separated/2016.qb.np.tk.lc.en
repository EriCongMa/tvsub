i &apos;m looking at a bribe , plain as day .
that &apos;s exactly what it is .
tony gianopolous got a hold of that video somehow .
i think he &apos;s trying to take over the company .
you son of a bitch . you leaked it .
ava hessington is hessington oil .
not for long .
excuse me ?
this is my call .
i &apos;m afraid it isn &apos;t .
you &apos;d like her to remove herself from management ?
i &apos;m not going to stand for losing this takeover .
then don &apos;t . but ava isn &apos;t going anywhere .
i just got voted out of my own company .
i stand by my decision , and i &apos;d do it again .
don &apos;t tell me it doesn &apos;t have to do with darby .
you &apos;re the one who gave him the 51 % in the first place .
you can &apos;t stand being number two .
please tell me you &apos;re calling me
because you &apos;ve been kidnapped .
i &apos;m not the one who disappeared .
i told you i had a thing .
at 1 : 00 . it &apos;s 1 : 45 .
and it &apos;s called a lunch hour , harvey .
60 whole minutes , which my teeth deserve .
you fit the dentist in at lunch ?
he can be surprisingly quick ,
yet remarkably thorough .
donna , judge atkins is ready to hear
my motion for summary judgment , which she won &apos;t do
if there aren &apos;t two copies of that motion
in my hands in ten minutes .
all right , here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
go to my computer and press &quot; print . &quot;
pick the motions up off the printer ,
then walk over to the corner , throw everything in the trash ,
because there &apos;s already two copies
on your desk at this very moment .
so the trash can &apos;s in the corner then ?
bye .
you had &quot; a thing &quot; ?
well ... two things .
but who &apos;s counting ?
what did he want anyway ?
i thought we agreed not to talk about work at lunch .
yeah , we did ,
but we also agreed to have lunch at lunch .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s just that , uh , i &apos;ve always made it my business
knowing about things .
and you &apos;re good at your business .
business is good .
some might say booming .
listen , we &apos;ve only got 15 minutes left ,
so i &apos;ll endeavor to be surprisingly quick .
as long as you continue to be remarkably thorough .
your honor , you said you would dismiss this case
if he couldn &apos;t produce evidence
beyond the bribery tape . well , he couldn &apos;t .
we found five witnesses that tied the man
that ava hessington bribed on that tape to the murders .
and those witnesses refused to come forward .
if we can &apos;t confront them ,
then their statements are inadmissible .
just because they won &apos;t come forward
doesn &apos;t mean they don &apos;t exist .
he &apos;s right , their statements may be inadmissible ,
but i can &apos;t ignore the fact that they were made .
well , in that case , we move for an expedited trial .
ten seconds ago , he was moving for a dismissal .
and in the ten seconds since ,
public opinion of my client has gone down even further .
she &apos;s a murderer . how much lower can it go ?
well , you tell me .
you leaked evidence to tony gianopolous
that lost her her company .
you might leak it to anyone .
your honor , we &apos;ve been down this road before .
it &apos;s called bullshit highway .
all dragging this out does is delay ava hessington
the opportunity to vindicate herself .
it also conveniently gives me less time to build my case .
but the case you just argued was solid enough to go to trial .
you &apos;re letting your mini @-@ me make your arguments for you now ?
are you letting your moustache--
enough .
the trial starts a week from monday .
get out .
you still haven &apos;t told harvey about stephen ?
i went to tell him , but he was in a bad mood ,
and then somehow i ended up telling him
that i made some copies for stephen ,
and he got really pissed .
what &apos;s he gonna do when he finds out about this ?
but i thought you said that you two had never--
so ?
so i get why he doesn &apos;t want to share you here .
you &apos;re his everything here .
but what you &apos;re doing with stephen isn &apos;t here ,
it &apos;s there . two completely different things .
then why did you tell me i had to tell him ?
to let him know that your there and his here
can coexist in the same place .
i liked it better when we talked about you and mike .
i &apos;m sure you did .
so are you two going to keep--
yes , it is some of the best damn ...
yoga i &apos;ve had in a long time .
well , sooner or later , he &apos;s gonna find out ,
because it is all over your face .
oh , please , you &apos;re a woman .
men are oblivious .
there &apos;s something different about you .
what is it ?
yes , please tell the man what it is .
nothing , louis .
i &apos;m just-- been doing some yoga .
no , that &apos;s not it .
you &apos;re practically glowing .
tell me your secret .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think that it &apos;s your cup of tea .
for that glow , i &apos;d tea .
i &apos;m gonna have to keep this to myself , louis .
okay , well , promise me
you &apos;ll keep doing whatever it is you &apos;re doing .
i think she can do that .
no , i &apos;m serious , donna . morning , noon , and night .
five times a day if necessary .
i will do my best .
well , we did our best .
our best ?
wait a minute , you never expected
this case to get dismissed .
then why would i ask for it ?
because she was more likely to grant an expedited trial
after saying no to a dismissal .
and now , cameron &apos;s got a shity case to try
with no evidence
and less than two weeks to get any more .
wait a second .
what if they didn &apos;t just have to scramble for new evidence ?
what if they had to scramble for a whole new lawyer ?
any lawyer who got assigned this case
with only two weeks to go would drop the whole thing .
unless they had a personal beef with you ,
which they wouldn &apos;t .
there &apos;s only one way
to get cameron thrown off this case .
prove he colluded with gianopolous .
turn bullshit highway into ... fact highway .
fact highway ?
yeah , you know , it &apos;s right next to
&quot; i don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore &quot; lane .
we &apos;re gonna have to talk about how to prove they colluded
because we have a chance to get rid of this murder charge
once and for all .
第二季第四集
katrina said you wanted to see me ?
hey , simon , come on in . i have a question for you .
come on , you need to see this .
look at this . this is so funny .
is that some sort of joke ?
nominal in the first paragraph ,
pagination on the left @-@ hand side ,
times new roman &apos;s stupid little feet
walking all across the page .
and what &apos;s that word ?
&quot; shall &quot; ?
mm .
at this firm , we instruct , we advise , we order ,
we must , but we do not &quot; shall . &quot;
that &apos;s not really a--
why must we &quot; must &quot; ?
because we thrust , we don &apos;t parry .
rewrite this .
i can &apos;t .
excuse me ?
mr. nesbitt has clearly instructed us--
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . this was nigel &apos;s doing ?
per his most recent memo .
he &apos;s communicating with you through memos ?
you &apos;ve been left adrift on lady law &apos;s fickle ocean
with no rudder , no captain ?
he hasn &apos;t been in the office
since he took over the program ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking .
no , i think i was perfectly clear
in what i was asking , simon .
am i supposed to respond to that ?
yeah , by going back to your desk right now
and doing it correctly .
but--
simon , a memo from nigel
is not gonna stick its boot in your ass .
a memo from me will . get out .
i told you , not at the office .
you mean i can &apos;t see harvey at the office ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s what i &apos;m here to do .
what ?
you know what .
you haven &apos;t told him yet .
it &apos;s none of his business .
he and i are here , and you and i are ... there .
i wish we were there .
i just told you , not here .
donna , what &apos;s going on out there ?
i think he means out here .
you have a walk @-@ in .
what are you doing here ?
what i &apos;ve always been doing here ,
representing edward darby &apos;s wishes .
i lost ava her company .
i assume my deal with edward is dead .
well , edward doesn &apos;t see it like that .
you may have failed ,
but jessica took a shot at her own team .
and the consequences of that are what ?
deal stays in place
as long as you win her murder trial .
what if my plan is to not even have a murder trial ?
well , as long as you don &apos;t accomplish that
by having ava plead guilty ,
you &apos;ll be the next managing partner .
good , because i &apos;m going to accomplish it
by getting cameron dennis thrown off this case
for colluding with tony gianopolous .
and how are you going to accomplish that ?
by suing tony gianopolous .
for what ?
for this ... or this ...
and / or that .
yeah , that &apos;s good .
it is .
yeah .
but i can do better .
no way .
$ 5,000 says i can .
$ 10,000 says you can &apos;t .
excellent .
what &apos;s your idea ?
well , it requires you to take me with you
to see mr. gianopolous .
mike ?
yeah .
you &apos;re off the case .
what ? you &apos;re gonna let him get away with that ?
i have to . i just took a bet .
there &apos;s no going back on a bet .
okay , what if i bet him that my idea &apos;s better ?
then can i come ?
you gonna pony up $ 10,000 ?
best of luck , guys . hope it works out .
so you &apos;re off the case ?
yeah , thanks to stephen huntley .
well , doesn &apos;t he have his hand in a lot of cookie jars ?
what does that mean ?
nothing .
wait a second , &quot; nothing &quot; never means nothing .
sometimes it means something .
ah , do you want me to force it out of you ?
i may or may not need plausible deniability .
rachel .
donna slept with stephen .
holy shit .
you cannot let her know that you know .
does harvey know ?
no , not yet .
don &apos;t you dare tell him .
yeah , like i &apos;m gonna touch that with a 10 @-@ foot pole .
but he &apos;s gonna care that she didn &apos;t tell him .
so how are you gonna get back on that case ?
um , i got a different case .
graham stenton .
the accountant who embezzled $ 30 million from our client ?
yep .
and our job is to get the money back , quietly .
our job as in pearson darby ?
our job as in you and me .
i &apos;m interviewing his associate this afternoon ,
and i need your help .
you want me to be the mike to your harvey .
i do want you to be the mike to my harvey .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not really a thing .
it can be .
i get to ask half the questions .
oh , harvey doesn &apos;t let mike ask half the questions .
fine , 1 / 3 .
harvey doesn &apos;t negotiate with mike .
mike doesn &apos;t have sex with harvey .
1 / 3 of the questions seems reasonable to me .
could you possibly keep your thwacking to yourself ?
this is a private club .
with a sister club in london .
courtesy mudding privileges .
and , yes , it &apos;s turkish .
outside mud is a clear violation of club policy .
there are rules , nigel .
just as there are rules
forbidding interference with my associates .
yeah , well , you don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass about them .
how dare you ?
you know , let me tell you something you may not know .
associates , they &apos;re like grains of sand .
they need pressure and heat
to shape them into chihuly glass .
memos from a distant land don &apos;t shape shit into shit .
nonsense .
i attended boarding school from the tender age of four ,
during which time i received weekly memos from my father .
yeah , and look how you turned out .
graduating summa cum laude from both cambridge and harvard
is quite the failure .
your parents &apos; choice to &quot; homeschool , &quot; much better .
okay , that was only till i was ten ,
and my mother &apos;s science fair was legendary .
you must be so proud of your uncontested blue ribbons .
okay , you know what ,
i &apos;m not gonna let you shatter
the glass that i spent years blowing .
and i &apos;m certainly not gonna let the likes of you
tell me who i can and cannot blow .
he &apos;s not gonna come .
he will .
you pushed his assistant ?
i charmed her .
you didn &apos;t .
he &apos;s right , you didn &apos;t .
she was irritated .
but i was curious .
works for me .
you know what they say about curiosity .
i get it .
i come after hessington oil , you come after me .
well , bring it on , boys .
i got a team of lawyers
just itching to take your lunch money .
well , unfortunately , you &apos;re not gonna be able to use them .
he &apos;s not gonna sue you here .
he &apos;s gonna sue you in london ,
where you have countless holdings .
where the burden of proof isn &apos;t on the plaintiff .
it &apos;s on the defendant .
so instead of us having to prove you &apos;re guilty ,
you &apos;ll have to prove you &apos;re innocent .
doesn &apos;t look very innocent .
so you guys think i &apos;m gonna run scared
at the prospect of losing a little money .
i &apos;m a corporate raider .
this is a $ 50,000 bond .
you see , i &apos;m not in this business for the money .
money &apos;s just about keeping score .
i &apos;m in this business to win .
well , here &apos;s the thing , tony .
this trial &apos;s gonna take a while .
you &apos;ll be going to hearing after hearing ,
deposition after deposition .
you won &apos;t be able to enjoy your business at all .
so even if you win , you lose .
or ?
well , i ... i could withdraw the suit .
and all that &apos;ll cost you
is the truth , that you colluded with cameron dennis .
ah , but i didn &apos;t collude shit .
yes , you did ,
when you let him leak you that video of ava hessington ,
then tried to use it to take over hessington oil .
all right , it &apos;s time we celebrate
celebrate what ?
our first case as a couple .
we should go to that french place you like ,
get a bottle of wine ,
a couple of things that i don &apos;t know how to pronounce ,
and then go back to my place and celebrate .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re calling it these days ?
well , &quot; victory sex &quot; seemed less romantic .
well , i can &apos;t tonight .
why not ?
i have dinner with my parents .
maybe i could come with you .
um ... yeah , i--
unless you don &apos;t want me there .
wait a minute .
you don &apos;t want me there .
of course i do .
you don &apos;t look like you do .
is it because i &apos;m white ?
that &apos;s not funny .
empirically it is .
no , it &apos;s not ,
and you &apos;re acting like it &apos;s nothing .
rachel , come on , look , i know it &apos;s something ,
but you &apos;re acting like it &apos;s everything .
it is everything .
wait a second .
do you not want me
to meet them tonight or at all ?
i don &apos;t want them to find out your secret .
they &apos;re not gonna find out .
how do you know that ?
because no one finds out .
you , donna , jessica ,
you were all told .
besides , i met your dad . he didn &apos;t figure it out .
he met you as someone
that he wouldn &apos;t give a second thought to , mike .
as my boyfriend , he is going to put you
under the microscope .
i can pass inspection .
well , what about me ?
because you might be experienced at lying to the world ,
but i &apos;m not .
and it &apos;s not the world , it &apos;s my family .
okay , rachel , you and i have told each other
that we love each other , right ?
did we mean that or not ?
if we did , then at some point ,
i am gonna have to meet your parents .
interview &apos;s in 20 minutes . we should go .
make yourself at home .
i wanted to talk to you in here .
is this about your--
no , no .
you don &apos;t even know what i was gonna say .
how &apos;d it go with gianopolous ?
well , he &apos;s not a pushover ,
but i think we have a good plan .
so it went well ?
yeah , it went well .
and since when are you--
i &apos;m sleeping with stephen .
i can see that .
you can see that ?
that &apos;s all you have to say ?
do you want me to say more ?
it depends on what you would say .
i &apos;d say , &quot; when ? &quot;
three days ago .
why didn &apos;t you tell me before ?
i was going to , but you got so upset
when you thought i was working for him .
because you work for me .
well , i &apos;m not working for him .
good .
so you &apos;re not upset .
no .
what you &apos;re doing with him is personal .
and this isn &apos;t ?
donna ,
i don &apos;t wanna make this a thing .
i don &apos;t either .
i just want to make sure that it doesn &apos;t become a thing .
it won &apos;t as long as you don &apos;t let that affect this .
okay .
miss clark , do you know graham stenton well ?
we &apos;ve worked together for a while .
and you handle the books for his accounts ,
is that right ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
we just need to know when exactly you became aware
that mr. stenton was manipulating the numbers .
i don &apos;t believe he was .
well , the auditors disagree .
well , i disagree with them .
graham &apos;s a good person .
i &apos;m sure bernie madoff &apos;s friends all said the same thing .
that isn &apos;t fair .
and graham isn &apos;t the only person
who had access to those accounts .
mr. oxnard , mr. dipetro ,
several individuals from the controller &apos;s office .
i just have one question for you .
how long have you been sleeping with him ?
what ?
you smiled when you started talking about him .
you called him &quot; graham . &quot;
you &apos;ve referred to everyone else as &quot; mister &quot; or &quot; individual . &quot;
and when my colleague asked you about sleeping with him ,
you didn &apos;t seem offended , you seemed caught .
i had nothing to do with this .
that doesn &apos;t mean you don &apos;t know anything .
look , miss clark ,
we &apos;re trying to make this go away quietly ,
but if we can &apos;t ,
we &apos;re gonna make it go away loudly ,
which means putting you on the stand .
beth , you won &apos;t be able to take the fifth
because you won &apos;t be testifying against yourself .
and if you lie on the stand ,
that &apos;s perjury .
look , if you really want to protect him ,
just get him to give us the money back now ,
while we can still take care of this quietly .
i can &apos;t .
that &apos;s it , i &apos;m calling the d.a.
i think we should give her some time to think about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
mike , it &apos;s a hard decision .
fine . she has until tomorrow .
oh , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
simon .
mr. nesbitt gave us all gifts .
and they &apos;re funny ?
i think they &apos;re meant to be .
well , you know , he has trouble connecting ,
but he &apos;s making an effort .
maybe he took my words to heart .
what &apos;d you say to him ?
去你的
turned out quite well .
you crossed a line .
i did no such thing .
you took a private feud , and you made it public .
after you tried to undermine my authority .
because you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
i knew what i was doing when i took them from you
like biscuits from a schoolboy .
all right , you son of a bitch .
you better get yourself ready , &apos; cause i &apos;m about to kick--
i know it &apos;s generally against regulations ,
but her nanny fell ill , and--
no , no , no , no . say no more .
a father &apos;s love knows no rule .
i didn &apos;t know you were a cat man .
do i have brains in my head ?
do i have a heart in my chest ?
who is this stunning creature ?
her moniker is &quot; mikado . &quot;
so does that mean she enjoys--
yes , whenever we travel , i make sure she has
some gilbert and sullivan playing in her sherpa .
uh , do be careful , she doesn &apos;t normally like--
my god .
what ?
does she prefer the left side ?
she doesn &apos;t normally let anyone touch her except me .
i happen to have a way with those of the feline persuasion .
do you have any cream ?
执行合伙人
you wanted to see me ?
yes . i had some free time .
oakwood foods canceled our 10 : 00 a.m. meeting ,
as did omni holdings at noon
and dunbar securities at 4 : 00 .
sounds like you need to work on your people skills .
you need to work on your people skills .
those meetings were canceled because we just got fired .
and why is that my fault ?
they &apos;re not my clients . i &apos;ve never even met them .
no , but evidently ,
you have met their new owner ,
tony gianopolous , who bought them
for the sole purpose of firing us .
good .
i pissed him off . that means it &apos;s working .
oh , you mean that plan of yours
you didn &apos;t think to tell me about .
oh , i thought about it , and then i thought
you &apos;d just go behind my back and undo it .
so you went behind my back and went to stephen huntley .
i told you , i trust him .
well , you &apos;re the one
who likes to throw darby &apos;s name around .
so why don &apos;t you and stephen call him
and let him know
that you single @-@ handedly lost us more business in a day
than you &apos;ve ever gotten in a month .
and feel free to use my phone .
since you freed up my afternoon ,
i &apos;m taking the rest of the day off .
did you see the look on her face ?
are you kidding ? we put that look on her face .
good cop , bad cop .
mike , harvey .
so i guess it is a thing .
so we should have the money back by this weekend ,
and then , we can celebrate .
i was thinking that we could celebrate tonight ...
after dinner with my parents .
do you want me to come ?
that look on beth &apos;s face ,
it didn &apos;t just say that they slept together .
she loves him .
i told you i love you , and i meant it .
that &apos;s not something i want to hide from my family .
i actually made plans , so i &apos;m not gonna be able to--
bad joke ?
no , terrible timing .
bad timing .
okay . i guessed .
i need your help with gianopolous .
relax , if he &apos;s making another run
at hessington oil , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
well , how can you know that ?
because you just restructured ,
and he can &apos;t force another takeover vote
for at least six months .
then why is he driving my stock into the ground ?
what ?
he &apos;s been dumping it all day .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
what did you do ?
we picked a fight with him .
we &apos;ve just finished a fight with him
that ended with me losing control of my company ,
so why in god &apos;s name would you pick another ?
to get you out of these murder charges once and for all ,
and after i do ,
we &apos;ll figure out a way to get you back in charge .
you see that you do ,
because i would rather rot in a cell
than let that man take over my company .
so i tell this , it &apos;s not my fault that she may be early .
i &apos;m in the middle my of closing arguments .
and i tell him that if he &apos;s not with me when she arrives ,
the next case he &apos;ll trail
is his own murder .
then i walk in the room ,
and she sees that i was right outside the door the whole time .
i was not amused .
you weren &apos;t amused ?
you actually didn &apos;t go into labor for another week .
i lost that case .
robert , you &apos;ve had enough potatoes .
she &apos;s trying to make me eat that foodie bullshit .
oh , i find that hard to believe .
made me a smoothie this morning ,
i got all excited . it was green .
that &apos;s what healthy looks like .
thank you , rachel .
you &apos;re not alone .
what was that ?
i &apos;m bonding with your father here .
speaking of which--
robert .
what ? you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m gonna say .
i know the next six things you &apos;re gonna say ,
and you &apos;re not gonna say them , because i told you ,
rachel doesn &apos;t want you grilling this poor young man .
what ?
mom .
you &apos;re not taking it easy on me , are you ?
a little .
you told me to rein him in .
i also told you not to tell him .
that &apos;s not how we do things in this family .
i &apos;m not keeping things from your father .
you kept it from me when you scratched the car .
robert , eat your potatoes .
what &apos;s so funny ?
she &apos;s not consistent with the potatoes .
she &apos;s not consistent with anything .
okay , you &apos;re not getting any potatoes .
now what &apos;s so funny ?
i see where she gets it from .
gets what ?
you better shut up and eat your potatoes .
she actually said she &apos;d prefer to rot in a cell ?
well , you &apos;ve gotta give her credit for that .
you do , and she &apos;s right .
it &apos;s not making any sense .
if he &apos;s not making a run , why is he dumping her shares ?
he &apos;s reacting .
he &apos;s overreacting .
he may have money to burn ,
but this isn &apos;t tens of thousands , it &apos;s tens of millions .
it &apos;s completely out of proportion .
not exactly .
what are you talking about ?
i subpoenaed his daughter .
you what ?
he fired our client , so i struck back .
and you didn &apos;t think to run that by me ?
no , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d say no .
i &apos;d say no because i &apos;m not an idiot .
idiot ?
we need this man to help us .
you just made him a permanent enemy .
me ? we did this together .
don &apos;t put this on me .
you &apos;re putting it on me .
because you goddamn did it !
you were going to go after him no matter what i said .
i attacked his business .
you went after his family .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve never done the same thing ,
and what &apos;s the difference between me doing it ,
other than the fact that--
i see .
this isn &apos;t about me getting personal with gianopolous .
this is about me getting personal with donna .
i &apos;m gonna pretend you didn &apos;t just say that .
is that because she &apos;s listening ?
i don &apos;t give a shit if she hears it or not .
you crossed a line with gianopolous ,
and you just crossed another one with me .
you know , you &apos;ve had it in for me from the start .
and you &apos;ve only been with donna for three days ,
that should tell you something .
let me spell it out for you , okay ?
you don &apos;t work my case without me ,
and since you seem to be having trouble understanding that ,
you don &apos;t work my case at all .
now get out of my office .
so , michael ,
mike .
so now you &apos;re gonna tell me what to call you ?
no , i @-@ i--it &apos;s-- people usually call me--
i &apos;m just messing with you .
so where are you from ?
i grew up in brooklyn .
brothers , sisters ?
only child .
parents still there ?
they both died when i was a kid .
nah , you &apos;re messing with me .
i just asked an orphan about his dead parents
and made a joke about it , didn &apos;t i ?
does he like apple or blueberry ?
mom , shh , i &apos;m trying to hear what they &apos;re saying .
rachel , relax , he can handle your father .
how do you know ?
because you wouldn &apos;t have brought him here if he couldn &apos;t .
besides , what are you so afraid they &apos;re gonna say ?
you &apos;re right . nothing .
honey , what is it ?
you don &apos;t have to tell me .
but just tell me this ,
do you love him ?
as long as he hasn &apos;t killed someone , it &apos;ll all work out .
come on .
i thought you were taking the day off .
that was the day , this is the night ,
and my name is still on the door .
it is .
what do you want , harvey ?
you were right .
we &apos;ve had a lot of disagreements lately .
which one are you referring to ?
i &apos;m not entirely sure stephen huntley &apos;s judgment
is better than yours .
he went behind my back .
going behind someone &apos;s back
doesn &apos;t seem like something you have a problem with .
maybe , but he hit gianopolous below the belt ,
and now we have a problem .
we have a problem ?
you said your name was still on the door .
i &apos;m coming to you for help .
what &apos;s our problem ?
he &apos;s dumping hessington oil shares
just to drive her into the ground .
well , if we can come together ,
maybe they can come together .
i &apos;m listening .
tony gianopolous wants to own hessington oil .
ava wants to control it .
she sells him her shares ,
he gives her the voting rights .
and he gives up cameron dennis .
they get what they want , and so do we .
you think he &apos;ll still go for it ?
he &apos;ll know we &apos;re coming to him because he won .
he won &apos;t be the problem .
ava said she &apos;d rather rot
than see him take over her company .
i &apos;ll take care of ava .
look , it seems like you two get along ,
and i like you .
so i &apos;m gonna ask you this straight .
she &apos;s worked her ass off to become a lawyer .
i know .
well , i don &apos;t want anything to stand in her way .
i would never do that .
so what happens when she gets into stanford ?
you didn &apos;t know she applied there .
looks like you two have something to talk about .
you &apos;re very quite this morning .
just tired .
still ? i mean , you went home right after dinner last night .
yeah , trouble sleeping .
is something wrong ?
hey , who the hell do you think you are ?
mr. stenton , i guess you got our message .
oh , i did , and now i &apos;ve got one for you .
beth and i got married this morning .
you married a woman to protect yourself ?
i married her because i love her .
but you did it to make any conversation
that the two of you had privileged .
says the lawyer who threatened her .
well , now you take this to trial , she won &apos;t testify .
well , it &apos;s too bad spousal privilege
doesn &apos;t apply to bullshit marriages .
yeah , good luck arguing that .
we offered the two of you a chance to give back the money
and walk away , but after we prove you did this--
oh , you can &apos;t prove i did a thing .
and now , you can &apos;t force her to prove it for you either .
you never returned my call last night .
well , what could be different about last night
than the night before ? hmm ?
maybe the fact that you went to harvey
and you threw me in his face .
um , i was just telling it how it was .
he &apos;s already got it in for us anyway .
well , that &apos;s my business with him , not yours .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i never wanted to make things awkward for you and harvey .
you made things awkward for you and me .
donna--
i like you , stephen ,
and i have enjoyed our short @-@ term arrangement ,
but i don &apos;t enjoy complications .
i don &apos;t either , but it seems we have one .
now , i &apos;m affected by you more than i thought ,
and i &apos;m finding i &apos;d like to extend our term .
i &apos;ll take your offer under advisement .
i am not selling my shares to that man .
i don &apos;t know you that well , ava ,
and i won &apos;t pretend that i do ,
but we do have something in common .
what is that ?
i merged with edward darby
to save my firm from being hijacked
by my piece of shit ex @-@ partner .
and what exactly does that give us in common ?
i know what it &apos;s like to prefer rotting in the ground
than letting my enemy take what &apos;s mine .
i said , &quot; rotting in a cell . &quot;
i wasn &apos;t up on murder charges .
and you &apos;d rather have died ?
i was speaking metaphorically , as i &apos;m sure you were .
was i ?
you won &apos;t be able to run your company from a cell .
my point is ,
i didn &apos;t want to merge ,
but i did what i had to do to keep my company mine .
and how is that working out for you ?
it has its ups and downs ,
but i wouldn &apos;t be standing here in front of you
if i hadn &apos;t done it .
not exactly a ringing endorsement .
ava ...
do this . get free of your murder charges .
nobody is saying we can &apos;t try
to get you out of this deal later .
i don &apos;t care what it takes ,
i &apos;m not losing to that guy .
we need to find a way around spousal privilege .
i don &apos;t see how we can .
stupid goddamn law . excuse me .
it &apos;s not entirely stupid .
oh , what , so now , you &apos;re on his side ?
no , privilege exists for a reason .
you don &apos;t want to have to worry about
what you trust your partner with .
that &apos;s assuming your partner
even trusts you in the first place .
what is that even supposed to mean ?
it means , when were you gonna tell me you applied to stanford ?
okay , so that &apos;s why you &apos;ve barely
said three words to me since last night .
my dad told you .
no , no , he didn &apos;t tell me , he asked me how i felt about it
because he assumed i knew ,
like i know about all the east coast schools
that you applied to .
mike ...
first you didn &apos;t want me to meet your parents ,
and now this ?
yeah , and i changed my mind about you meeting my parents ,
which i &apos;m now beginning to regret .
oh , why , because i found out you hid something from me ?
like you never hid anything from me .
i hid something from you , it kept us apart .
what brought us together was me telling you everything .
i was going to tell you .
when ?
before i went , on friday .
you &apos;re going there ?
i got an interview . i &apos;m sorry .
i just didn &apos;t know how to tell you , mike
i don &apos;t know , how about ,
&quot; hey , mike , i might go to law school 3,000 miles away &quot; ?
i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m gonna get in ,
which is exactly why i didn &apos;t want to have this conversation .
no , you didn &apos;t want to have it because you might go there
and you &apos;re too afraid to say it .
okay . i might want to go there .
i &apos;ve said it .
you may enter .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve got a bit of a sticky wicket .
that sounds uncomfortable .
the hong kong office urgently requires me
for a few weeks .
normally , i &apos;d bring mikado , but ...
whoa , wait , are you asking me to ...
i can &apos;t get her papers in time .
she &apos;d be facing quarantine .
she &apos;d sooner die .
you already understand her so well .
i do , yet a request of this magnitude ...
no , you &apos;re probably right , it &apos;s too much to ask .
i &apos;m sure there is a suitable luxury feline hotel .
don &apos;t play games , okay ? we both know there isn &apos;t .
so you &apos;ll do it ?
n ... yes , can i have her ?
do you have a minute ?
i don &apos;t really feel like talking about us right now .
it &apos;s not about that .
our discussion gave me an idea .
our discussion ?
can we please not fight about what to call our fight ?
what &apos;s the idea ?
we don &apos;t do good cop , bad cop anymore .
we do bad cop , bad cop .
the way i &apos;m feeling right now ,
yeah , i can do bad cop .
since when do you come out here ?
since they added asiago cheese .
your reward of choice for a job well done .
you remember that story ?
first story you ever told me . you think i &apos;d forget ?
that wasn &apos;t the point of the story .
i assume you got ava to agree .
yes , i did .
should i be buying you an asiago bagel ?
poppy seed .
the &quot; good news , bad news &quot; bagel .
gianopolous agreed to the deal .
he gave up cameron dennis .
what &apos;s the bad news ?
cameron protected himself .
he never explicitly told gianopolous about the tape
and never actually showed him the tape .
so what &apos;s the good news ?
he never explicitly said anything ,
but he left gianopolous alone
in the room with that tape .
late night ?
no sleep at all .
the ulcer ?
no , nigel &apos;s cat .
you slept at nigel &apos;s ?
no , he &apos;s out of town . i &apos;m cat @-@ sitting .
mikado won &apos;t drink her cream
unless it &apos;s precisely 5.5 degrees celsius ,
she turned her nose up at bruno &apos;s origami collection ,
and she won &apos;t use her litter box unless
it &apos;s facing london .
hate that damn thing .
you &apos;re loving every second with her , aren &apos;t you ?
all 86,400 of them .
by the way , you don &apos;t have that glow today , donna .
you stop yoga ?
i took a couple nights off .
is this because of harvey ?
cause i don &apos;t care what he says , donna ,
you can &apos;t let work get in the way of that glow .
you know what , louis , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m gonna schedule an extra long session tonight .
ooh , can i come ?
harvey , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to tell you that you lost .
i didn &apos;t lose . i may not have much time ,
but i still got ...
that tape ?
not anymore , unless you want to dispute
tony gianopolous &apos; sworn statement
that you left him alone with it .
i can fight this .
chain of custody is something
i know a little bit about , thanks to you .
that tape is gone , and so are you .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
admit it , cameron , i beat you .
save yourself the embarrassment , and cancel this trial .
if you think i would ever do that ,
i taught you even less than i thought .
this case was 50 / 50 .
all you did was make it 80 / 20 .
99 to 1 .
it could be a million to one for all i care .
we &apos;re in the ring , i &apos;m still standing , and this isn &apos;t done .
now get out of my face . i got a trial to prepare for .
what do you want ?
this is a request for charges to be filed against graham stenton
for stealing $ 30 million .
the penalty for which is 15 years in a federal prison .
if you had proof of that ,
you wouldn &apos;t have come after me in the first place .
we have proof that you knew something was wrong
and you didn &apos;t notify your employer .
which is why this is a request for charges
to be filed against you as an accessory after the fact .
the penalty for which is five years in a federal prison .
but you can avoid that by testifying against him .
even if i was willing to , i can &apos;t .
we &apos;re married . he &apos;d stop me from testifying .
in new york , not in connecticut .
which is where the charges will be filed .
you &apos;re asking me to turn against the man i love .
then go to jail and trust him .
i &apos;m guessing he &apos;s not gonna be there when you get out .
beth , even if he waits for you ,
he did this , and the fear of him getting caught
is going to cast a shadow over every moment
of the rest of your life together .
he may not be able to see that , but i know you can .
i &apos;ll get you the money back .
what are you doing ?
just leaving a note .
by the way , congratulations .
i hear you got the tape thrown out
and ava reinstated as the ceo .
in spite of you .
yeah , i know .
you went to jessica for help .
you have a problem with that ?
no .
i just think it &apos;s ironic that
she doesn &apos;t realize
she just helped you dig her own grave .
it &apos;s me .
money got wired into the account .
congratulations .
i don &apos;t think she would &apos;ve caved
if you hadn &apos;t broken script
and gone all good cop on me .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
rachel--
no , mike .
we &apos;re in a fight because i made the mistake
of not telling you that
i was considering going to stanford ,
but we &apos;re really in a fight
because i &apos;m considering going to stanford .
what you said to beth ,
was that really about me ?
because you said
the fear of him getting caught
was gonna cast a shadow over every minute
of the rest of their life together .
if you &apos;re asking if it &apos;s occurred to me
that going to stanford could be a fresh start ...
yeah .
it has , but the truth is
i may or may not get into yale or columbia ,
and you were the one that told me
that it &apos;d be stupid if i didn &apos;t just cover my bases ,
so i just need to go
and see if i even get in or not .
i get it .
i get all of it .
i just can &apos;t stop thinking about what will happen if you do .
you came to the decision
to let me in on your secret on your own ,
and i just need you to give me the freedom
to come to this decision on my own .
i &apos;m not one for sentimental gestures ,
but i was thinking about when hardman came back
and you and i got into it .
you got me my tea set back .
you here to thank me for that ?
i &apos;m here with a gesture of my own .
哈维 · 斯佩克特
this isn &apos;t a tea set .
it &apos;s going up on the wall tomorrow .
i asked for that a while ago .
you said i wasn &apos;t ready .
i also said i wasn &apos;t just going to slap
someone else &apos;s name up there next to mine ,
but i did .
and now you regret it .
and you &apos;re playing chess again .
what does that mean ?
it means , i want to know if this is a gesture
or if it &apos;s a move .
what it is , is my way of showing you
that darby &apos;s treating me the same way i treated you ,
and i understand how you felt .
you don &apos;t like it ,
and this is your way of getting me on your side .
harvey , i can &apos;t make you believe me ,
but i don &apos;t want you on my side .
i want us to be on the same side .
