anyone who grew up in the &apos; 80s will tell you
there &apos;s those huge moments you &apos;ll never forget .
mary lou retton winning the gold ...
hands across america ...
the fall of the berlin wall ...
alf eating his first cat .
but the thing i remember most was this --
my first kiss .
it was with dana caldwell , the girl down the block ,
and with the new school year ,
it was time to define our relationship .
mixtape . it &apos;s a genius move , pops .
i can say everything i need to say to dana
without actually having to say it .
forget the tape .
trust me , i know about women .
if you like a girl , you tell her face @-@ to @-@ face .
here &apos;s what i know about women --
they confuse and terrify me .
i &apos;m making a mixtape .
someone say mixtape ?
it &apos;s your lucky day .
you came to the right guy .
but i didn &apos;t come to you . you literally just came to me .
you can &apos;t just throw some top 40 stuff on a tape .
you need to tell a story ,
create a narrative about your love .
all right , first question --
is she your girl ?
i don &apos;t know .
i haven &apos;t seen her all summer .
she went to tennis camp . i went to space camp .
good .
she &apos;s an athlete . you &apos;re a nerd .
first song -- paula abdul , &quot; opposites attract . &quot;
i &apos;m listening .
next song , we reel her in
with a silky slow jam by yours truly ,
big tasty .
i &apos;m not listening .
too late .
next song , we go with a classic --
def leppard &apos;s &quot; pour some sugar on me . &quot;
that song &apos;s nasty .
exactly !
nasty wasn &apos;t my style ...
... so i spent the entire night making an epic mixtape .
it was the perfect blend of chicago , rem . ,
inxs , and weird al .
it was pure romance .
and that &apos;s our first official mixtape .
i hope you like it as much as i like you .
and just like that ,
i had created a piece of musical art --
a veritable love letter for the ears ,
guaranteed to capture the heart of any woman .
unfortunately , it captured the heart of the wrong woman .
snuggle monster .
what &apos;s happening ? ! what time is it ? !
2 : 00 a.m.
i was just downstairs cleaning ,
and i found the mixture tape you made for me .
mom , here &apos;s the thing --
i just couldn &apos;t wait till morning
to let you know that i love you , too .
it was a rookie mistake
to leave anything lying around my house ,
but my mom wasn &apos;t so crazy
that she would actually think it was for her , right ?
you &apos;re still in here , aren &apos;t you ?
love you .
you got to tell her that mixtape was meant for dana .
i can &apos;t do that . look how happy she is .
it would shatter her to pieces .
well , you better find a way ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re heading down a very dark road here .
fluffy and delicious , just like you .
mom ...
uh , listen .
i need to tell you something .
oh , sweet boy , you &apos;ve already said it all with that tape .
truth is , i was terrified . you &apos;re in middle school now .
that &apos;s how old barry and erica were when they stopped loving me .
but now that you &apos;ve made me this tape ,
i know that you still love your mama ,
and you always will .
here &apos;s the thing , mom .
pops was right .
it was time to come clean , or do this .
i need a copy .
why ?
so ...
we can listen to it at the same time .
how adorable .
and you know what ?
tomorrow night after school ,
we &apos;re getting milkshakes
and going to that &quot; die hard &quot; movie you &apos;ve wanted to see .
&quot; die hard &quot; ? ! that &apos;s r @-@ rated !
no admission without an adult .
well , you got your adult right here , mister .
did you just make a date with your mother ?
yes !
this whole situation is super messed up !
damn it . who ate all the boo berry ?
i gave it to adam &apos; cause he &apos;s my favorite kid .
what ?
you can &apos;t say that out loud .
oh , i can , and i just did .
both of you , look at me .
adam &apos;s my favorite .
yeah , i &apos;m okay with it .
me too .
yep , it was a dark road , all right .
it was september 4 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and erica was kicking off the school year in a big way --
with a fake i.d.
well , nice to make your acquaintance ,
sophia lopez .
give it back .
you don &apos;t want to share it with me ?
that &apos;s not very generous ,
considering you &apos;re an organ donor
from the great state of new hampshire .
forget you saw this , understand ?
no can do .
i have a pornographic memory .
i want in .
no way . you can &apos;t handle a fake i.d.
you &apos;ll immediately get caught and ruin it for everyone .
well , if you don &apos;t help me get one , i &apos;m telling dad .
you wouldn &apos;t .
dad !
shut up .
dad !
you know he always comes on the third &quot; dad &quot;
&apos;cause he can &apos;t ignore it anymore ,
and the man won &apos;t be happy
&apos;cause he &apos;ll have to walk the stairs .
he hates to walk the stairs .
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;m not helping you .
dad !
what ? !
why are you calling my name ? what do you want ?
what the hell &apos;s so damn important
that you make me walk the stairs ?
well , i just discovered that erica is --
gonna help her brother . thank you for your time .
what came next was a classic murray goldberg golden rule --
one he said every day .
okay , whatever you two are up to ,
i &apos;m not bailing you out .
understood .
understood .
yeah .
guess i &apos;m downstairs for the rest of the day .
while barry &apos;s year was looking up ,
i was about to lock it down with dana .
so , do you want to ride our bikes later ?
i found a dead snake and i was wondering
if you wanted to poke it with a stick or something .
actually , um , a bunch of people are going to laserium tonight .
you know , the laser @-@ light show .
do you want to go together ?
i had a perfect opening to take pop &apos;s advice
and be honest with my special lady .
instead , i did this .
here . got to go .
it &apos;s a mixtape !
the good news was
i had a date with dana caldwell .
the bad news ...
i was double booked .
who &apos;s ready for our movie date ?
i bought a new sweater .
yeah , i was thinking , about our date ...
maybe we can hang out on saturday instead ?
really ?
yeah !
make a whole day of it .
pack a picnic , hit the park ,
get a paddle boat .
i mean , i don &apos;t want to be stuck in some movie .
i want to talk , find out what makes you tick ,
really dig in .
what do you think ?
holy i love that idea !
i love it .
great .
see you on saturday .
while i was spinning my web of lies ,
my brother and sister were working on
a deception of their own .
with double prints ,
your film comes out to $ 17.23 .
before the age of digital cameras ,
you actually had to venture across town
to get your pictures from a creepy guy in a vest .
there &apos;s your pictures . nice pecs .
what do you do , high weight , low reps ?
yeah . i do arms on weekends , legs on thursday .
let me do the talking .
of course .
remember me ?
sophia lopez .
i was here last week .
i want a fake i.d. , okay ?
you a cop ?
you wearing a wire , buddy ? huh ?
what &apos;s that strap ? what &apos;s down here ?
all right , if you are wearing a wire and i catch you ,
you have to retire from the force that day without a pension .
that &apos;s the law .
nobody &apos;s wearing a wire ,
and you should probably read a law book .
all right , let &apos;s do this .
step into the cutout .
step into the future .
this is so high @-@ tech .
yes , it is exciting .
all right , smile . and three , two , one .
dude , what are you doing ?
no . just act normal . lose the hat . come on .
but zeus alexander washington always wears a hat .
oh , no . that &apos;s your name ?
that &apos;s too many letters , dude .
that &apos;s to weird . it &apos;s too stupid .
i like my second choice better anyway --
james bond .
taken .
barry bonds .
also taken .
barry fakington !
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
just pick a normal name already .
barry goldberg !
that &apos;s your name .
erica goldberg .
idiot , that is my name !
sir richard chamberlain .
stop panicking !
mr. clock table !
now you &apos;re just saying things that you see .
i &apos;ll pick you a name , dude , all right ?
and just like that , barry had his new identity .
carlos del monaco of mehoopany , pennsylvania .
as barry was getting a new identity ,
i was still getting up the nerve
to find out where i stood with dana .
luckily , she made it easy for me .
i listened to the mixtape .
did you like it ?
i played it like four times .
you &apos;re a good boyfriend .
there it was .
proof that if you never speak your feelings ,
eventually , the other person will .
that night , i was walking on air ,
and nothing could bring me down .
hi , shmoopy .
did you kids have fun ?
for sure .
totally .
well , everybody buckle up ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re about to take a musical journey ...
... with a special mixtape ...
no ! no ! no ! no ! no ! no ! no !
... from my number @-@ one guy .
hey , it &apos;s me .
i made this tape special for you ,
and all the songs on it
remind me of us , especially this one ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re my inspiration .
you know our love was meant to be
is that my mixtape ?
to last forever
oh , balls .
and i want you here with me
you too , dana . it &apos;s fine .
what &apos;s going on ?
why does your mom have my mixtape ?
oh , you &apos;re confused .
um , adam made me that tape because i &apos;m the inspiration .
what ?
i thought i was the inspiration .
you are .
i &apos;m the inspiration .
those words are on that tape , yes .
so , then , who &apos;s the inspiration , adam ?
yeah , adam . who is the inspiration ?
did you give me and your mom the same mixtape ?
okay , both of you like to laugh ,
so you &apos;ll appreciate this .
yes .
this is weird .
i &apos;m just gonna go grab a ride with my friends .
no !
yeah , bye , dana .
don &apos;t go .
i made the tape for you , okay ?
but my mom thought it was for her
because she &apos;s a freaking lunatic !
i was just trying to spare her crazy feelings !
well , i &apos;m glad you spared her feelings .
i had seriously pissed off my girlfriend .
but maybe i could still salvage things with my mom .
so ...
is &quot; die hard &quot; still an option ?
yeah , no . not happening .
guess who just turned 25 !
carlos del monaco .
who wants spray paint ,
lottery tickets ?
i can vote , rent a car ,
lease a junior one @-@ bedroom apartment .
i &apos;m all man , all the time !
all right , party &apos;s over . give me your fake i.d.
fake i.d. ? where are you getting this ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe &apos; cause you &apos;ve literally shown it
to every student in school .
i have been trying to ignore you all day .
so , i got carried away .
come on , coach meller .
you remember the rush of having a fake i.d. , right ?
ah , geez , all right . just don &apos;t let me see it again .
you got it .
these lips are zipped .
yo . you the dude with the fake i.d. ?
yes , i am .
carlos del monaco at your service .
i &apos;m throwing an end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ summer bash at my place ,
seniors only ,
but you can come if you score us some beer .
i can get you all the beers you want , young man .
how many beers we talking ?
5 ? 10 ?
10 cases should be enough .
10 cases ?
entire senior class is counting on you , buddy .
don &apos;t let us down .
you got it .
you got it .
i &apos;m gonna get the entire senior class totally loaded tonight
with this little beauty right here .
no , you &apos;re not .
damn it !
dana .
wait .
look , i @-@ i know you &apos;ve been avoiding me ,
but we &apos;ve got to talk about what happened .
okay . talk .
seemed like my only option was to finally do
what pops said and speak from the heart .
or try the tape thing again .
oh , i &apos;ve made you a new mixtape .
only for you .
&quot; adam &apos;s sorry jams &quot; ?
every title has the word &quot; sorry &quot; in it .
that &apos;s great , and if i lose that ,
i can always get the other copy from your mom .
funny stuff .
but we &apos;re still on for laserium saturday , right ?
i think i just need some space .
space ? totally get it .
you &apos;re talking to the dude that went to space camp .
even though all the women in my life were mad at me ,
at least i could turn to a sweet cereal ghost
for comfort .
ah , boo berry .
or not .
aw , dang it . no more boo berry .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i gave the last of it to erica .
looks like i &apos;m the favorite kid now .
it won &apos;t last long , but i &apos;m enjoying it .
here you go , pumpkin loaf .
and you ...
enjoy your tuna !
i know how well it keeps on long school days .
if i ever wanted boo berry or my mother &apos;s love again ,
i had to give my mom a sincere apology ...
that i meant for someone else .
hey , i made this for you special .
&quot; adam &apos;s sorry jams . &quot;
sweet gesture .
where &apos;s the case ?
the case ? oh , no case .
i @-@ i wanted the music to speak for itself .
what &apos;s that case @-@ shaped thing in your pocket ?
that &apos;s my uno deck .
i ...
i have a big tournament at school .
got to go .
i know you made that mixture tape for dana !
no boo berry for you ever again !
as bad as things were for me ,
they were even worse for barry .
there you go , mur @-@ man . frosty cold one .
i didn &apos;t ask for this . what do you want ?
nothing .
i just thought i &apos;d bring my old man a bottle of suds .
speaking of ,
how many of those bad boys are in a case ?
24 .
damn it . that &apos;s so many beers .
i mean , there &apos;s only four here .
why don &apos;t we cruise down to wawa
and buy you a whole bunch more ?
i &apos;m not gonna buy you beer , moron .
pardon me ?
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m asking you for .
i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m looking for a fun father @-@ son activity , you know ?
like -- like buying beer .
or making beer .
that &apos;d be fun , right ?
let &apos;s go buy some yeast and barley
and start bonding in the bathtub .
okay ...
whatever stupid thing you &apos;re up to ,
i am not bailing you out .
i know you always say this ,
but let &apos;s just pretend for one second
i did something real stupid .
i can do that .
isn &apos;t it your legal responsibility as my father to bail me out ?
no .
it &apos;s my responsibility to make you face
whatever dumbass decision you made head on ,
even if it kills you .
i &apos;m a good dad .
barry didn &apos;t get what he wanted out of my dad .
but turns out he got what he wanted
out of my dad &apos;s wallet .
this should get me through the night .
i love beer .
this is all for you ?
sure is .
missus is a yapper .
so ... you &apos;re murray goldberg .
yeah .
work down at the old furniture store .
have the three kids back at home .
i call &apos; em morons ,
but i secretly love them .
so , you &apos;re telling me that you &apos;re almost 50 years old ?
i just look young .
got a bit of a baby face .
i &apos;m half hawaiian .
aloha .
okay , murray . when &apos;s your birthday ?
oh , i should know this .
damn it !
obviously , i , uh ...
i drink a lot .
you do know that your father comes in here every morning
for a cup of coffee , right ?
no , i did not .
i think i &apos;m gonna ring up your father .
thank you for your time .
it was friday night -- dwayne martin &apos;s senior party .
even though barry lost his fake i.d.
and my dad &apos;s real one ,
he was still determined to be the hero .
you are in so much trouble !
dad ? !
if you think i &apos;m gonna let you go into that party
with a bag full of --
sandwiches ? where &apos;s the beer ?
there is no beer .
but i went to lee &apos;s hoagies
and bought cheesesteaks and patty melts and heroes .
why ?
&apos;cause when you arrive to the party with a hero ,
they &apos;ll think you &apos;re a hero .
and another name for a hoagie is a hero !
and i want to be a hero !
you &apos;re a moron !
i know .
i mean , you spent their beer money on sandwiches ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
just wanted this year to be different .
you know , for --
for once , i want to go to a party
where people were actually excited to see me .
yo !
the moment had arrived .
collars were popped ,
which meant tension was high .
my dad had a choice .
he could do what he always said and not bail barry out ,
or he could do this ...
damn it , barry !
if you think you can take this ice @-@ cold , delicious beer ,
some of it very expensive from germany ,
you got another thing coming !
it &apos;s a good thing i came here !
let &apos;s go !
fight the power , carlos .
my brother may have failed , but my dad gave him a victory .
hey , honey .
you okay ?
kids used to make me stuff like this all the time .
i used to think i &apos;d need a bigger box .
guess not .
you do know that no son makes a mixtape for his mom .
i guess i just wanted it to be true .
i don &apos;t want adam turning out horrible like the others .
honey , he &apos;s a teenager . they &apos;re all horrible .
but it &apos;s just so hard , you know ?
i mean , when they &apos;re young ,
they just love you so much .
and then they grow up and they don &apos;t .
hey , adam loves you .
the fact that he didn &apos;t tell you
the truth about the tape just shows you how much .
but when it comes to him and dana ,
you got to stay out of it .
oh , my god . you &apos;re right .
guess i kind of made it more complicated for him .
he &apos;s a smart kid . he &apos;ll figure it out .
you &apos;re right .
i have to help him figure it out .
what ? no .
don &apos;t get involved .
yes . get involved !
make a grand gesture
to help win dana back for my little boy !
what &apos;s happening ?
are we even having the same conversation ?
don &apos;t do that !
i am gonna do that !
dad , you are the best .
i &apos;m gonna do it !
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry .
adam ?
we need to talk .
if you got another tape , just leave it .
no . no more tapes . just words .
i should &apos;ve just told you how i felt , okay ?
told you that i really like you .
told you that i never felt this way about anyone .
and ...
i &apos;d do anything to be your boyfriend .
i didn &apos;t know if she was buying it ,
then this happened .
i can &apos;t believe you did this .
yeah . it &apos;s unbelievable .
thank you .
oh , my god . how did you pull this off ?
i guess i just know the right person .
turns out my mom broke into the control booth
and terrified the engineer , but she actually saved me .
so , you &apos;re finally the hero .
i hope it felt good .
yep .
thanks to you .
you know , after all that big talk ,
in the end , you still rescued me .
well , don &apos;t get used to it . it &apos;ll never happen again .
come on . we both know you &apos;ll always bail me out .
no , i won &apos;t .
yes , you will .
no , i won &apos;t .
yes , you will .
yes , i will .
but don &apos;t tell the others .
that &apos;s the thing about parents .
no matter how hard we make it for them ,
they always bail us out .
hi , dana .
i never thought i &apos;d say this , but i love you ,
and remember , you &apos;re the everything ,
and here &apos;s the song by r.e.m. , &quot; you are the everything . &quot;
there you go . a new boat , huh ?
your wife loves to water ski .
i like the one @-@ piece ,
but the bikini really works on her .
how you doing , old @-@ timer ?
my granddaughter , sophia lopez ,
said that you might know how to fabricate an identification .
let &apos;s just say i could do such a thing .
why would a distinguished gentleman like yourself
require such an item ?
let &apos;s just say i told a younger woman i was 60
and need a way to prove it . can you help ?
it depends . are you a cop ?
becasuse if you &apos;re lying and bust me ,
not only do i go free , i get to keep your badge for a year .
that &apos;s the law .
i have $ 200 cash .
step into the cutout .
