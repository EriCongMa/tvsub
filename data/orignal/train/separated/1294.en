That's beautiful.
Yeah, if you're a farmer's wife.
Ma, come on. My birthday was last month.
It's fine.
Well, we're not leaving,
until we find something that we both like.
Did you bring food and water?
All right. Do me a favor. Try this one on.
No! Let me see.
Every girl needs an L.B.D.
Not me. I...Got vaccinated.
Come on!
Let me see it.
That is one stunning
little black dress.
And, Jane?
You look beautiful.
Mom, where am I gonna wear this?
A murder at the Boston pops?
Okay, we're not leaving until we buy it.
Okay, okay. Fine. Get the damn dress.
It'll look fabulous in my closet.
Thank you.
Rizzoli.
Hey. G-- mom!
Knock! Come on!
What? Like I haven't seen that before?
Okay, Frost. I'll meet you there.
Okay.
No, no. I'll be right there.
All right.
I love you.
No, not -- no, not you. Bye.
Okay. I'll see you later. Okay.
Thank you, mom!
Jane Rizzoli. Victor 825.
Damn. Look how young he is.
No obvious signs of injury. It's odd.
Listen. I can promise you
that we are working tirelessly
for justice in this case.
Yeah, "Tirelessly." Look at him work.
Shh! Somebody might hear you.
But as you know, uh, Boston has some of the finest...
I wonder if that guy has, like, a satellite for the news van.
No, he's not a cop. All right?
He's a police officer. He's a climber.
He's an ass!
Well, he's got a lot of pulp.
"Juice." We say, "Guy's got juice."
And you're gonna be drinking yours out of a sippy cup,
if you don't lower your voice.
What killed this kid? I don't see anything.
There's no -- no knife wounds...
No bullet entry or exit wounds.
No external sign of trauma to indicate a beating.
Wasn't killed for his stuff.
His school I.D.
"Mathias Senna."
15 -- God.
I'm never having kids.
What do you got for me, Rizzoli?
Don't you want to wait for the camera crews?
There's no obvious cause of death.
I'll know more after the autopsy.
Hey, hey. Hey.
Don't touch anything in my crime scene, all right?
So as to not contaminate.
Right.
You might want to take a look under there.
I'm not finished processing the scene.
Well, I bet that you could match those shoe prints to that skateboard...
If you tried.
I'd do it myself,
but I don't want to contaminate your crime scene.
Thank you. That's very helpful.
You're welcome.
Bye.
That went well.
Find something.
Mathias?
Mathias?!
Mathias.
Mathias.
Mathias.
No!
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Mathias
He didn't come home last night.
I even called his father.
You're divorced?
Since he was 10. We are fighting.
Over custody of Mathias?
All he wanted to do was skateboard.
I told him it's not safe out there!
He wouldn't listen.
The devil got into my boy.
And left me alone with his curse.
What do you mean "The devil"?
He was not the same
after he met those boys!
The skateboarders.
We'll need their names.
I don't know them.
I just know they are bad.
Mrs. Senna...
I understand that you don't trust us right now.
But we want to find your son's killer
as badly as you do,
And I promise you we will do everything --
everything we can to find the person who did this.
Thank you.
He was all I had.
How much you know about Cape Vrde?
You mean,
do I have any special insight because I'm black?
Yeah.
The gangbangers I've arresd
are usually somewhat suspicious of white female cops.
It's a pretty insular culture.
Uh, not that I really know much.
They think of themself as more Creole than black.
This Mathias was a good kid.
He's got no arrests, good grades.
All right, let's look at everything.
Pull up sex offenders and predators in the area,
See if anything pops.
Got it.
That comment the...the mother made about the devil getting into her son.
Let's see if there's any tie
to local gangs, devil worshipping.
And we narrow it down to, uh, skateboarders.
Nice. I'll check with Bric.
You seen Korsak?
Coffee shop.
Again?
Hey, Korsak.
Would you like coffee, Detective?
Uh, no, thank you.
Who's she?
New.
What are you doing here?
Working -- on my testimony for the O'Reilly murder.
I'm up tomorrow.
Yeah, but why are you working here?
Uh...It was cold at my desk.
All right. How's the trial looking?
Bunch of idiots on the jury who watch too much TV,
waiting for the presto-bango magic DNA.
Listen. You still got your connection at family court?
Okay, I got a juvie victim named Mathias Senna.
What do you need me for?
Well, I need to know now what is in that custody hearing.
Oh, sure. I'm not doing anything.
Thanks.
And switch to decaf.
Lungs are congested and heavy,
but overall organs appear normal.
So what's the cause of death here?
I don't have one.
Mees lines.
Possible indicators of toxins in his system.
So he was poisoned?
Mm. Doubtful.
A few pinpoint petechial hemorrhages
Could indicate asphyxia.
So he was suffocated.
No airway obstruction or external indication of strangulation.
Hello? Cause of death.
Do you think Lieutenant Grant was sexy?
You know, in a male kind of way?
Do you like him?
Not my type.
You know, I'll do a tox screen on arsenic and heavy metals.
Both of which can cause mees lines.
You just said he wasn't poisoned, maura.
I said it was doubtful,
based on the evidence.
God, woman.
Grant's a brass-kisser.
Even when we were young,
he had all the nuns wrapped around his little finger.
"Oh, I'll erase the board for you, sister Mary Pat."
At recess, he would yell out,
"Roly-poly Rizzoli eats cannoli."
Oh, you were overweight?
No. I was athletic.
Strong.
Maybe I was a little chubby.
Why? What'd they call you?
"Maura, the bore-a."
you know.
They meant "boring," but it doesn't rhyme.
Do you think maybe I was?
What is that?
Crime lab confirmed the presence of candle wax.
What?
Hold your questions.
These dark particles?
Those are burned feathers.
Okay, let me guess.
He was smothered with a burning down pillow
while...he drank candle wax.
No.
Maura, I know it makes you break out into hives
if you have to guess,
but I need a theory, okay?
Just -- just one.
The medical evidence is consistent
with what I would expect to find
if the victim went through an exorcism.
He was killed by an exorcism?
I didn't say that.
The dad's not religious. It's the mom's church.
It's a storefront.
Well, it may not look like a church,
but it's an urban crystallization
of a larger American pattern of religious choice.
Yeah.
It's also a good scam.
Even the drive-thru chapels are tax-exempt.
Well, commercial spaces can still be sacred.
This is the guy who runs it.
Father Osorio Kokou,
leader of the Cidade Velha Church.
Born "Reginald Perry..."
in and out of jail since he was a kid.
Robbery, assault.
Oh, check fraud.
Started his church while he was on parole.
So he's raking it in,
exorcism goes bad, he dumps the boy's body.
Excuse me. This is an awful lot of speculation.
It's a theory. It's different.
Besides, who in this day and age is performing exorcisms?
Well, the Catholic church has been performing exorcisms
since the second century, and they still do.
It's an effective ritual for expelling demons.
Good to know.
This is Father Kokou, my priest.
Hello.
Hello.
We're investigating the death of Mathias.
Did you perform an exorcism on him?
We performed purification rituals on the boy.
Yes.
And did you "purify" him
the night he disappeared?
Father Kokou would never hurt Mathias.
He was helping.
Exorcisms are very powerful.
Is that what she said?
No.
Is that what you said?
No.
Maura.
I...I said "May god give his soul rest."
And she thanked me by saying "Stay in God's peace."
We were fighting hard for Mathias.
The devil was strong in him.
And the devil killed him.
See, we don't think the devil killed him.
We think Mathias may have been killed by an exorcism.
"Think." So you don't know.
You're good, Reginald.
We're not finished.
Thanks for stopping by.
This is a house in mourning.
It's time for you to go.
Beatrice, that's up to you.
Please do as the priest said.
The forces of evil are powerful.
I can handle evil.
Not this kind.
You are a little bit disrespectful.
I was disrespectful?
Father "Cuckoo" back there is my number-one suspect.
Father Kokou.
I know, Maura. I was making a point.
Well, "Kokou" is the most popular boy's name with Capeverdeans.
Okay, I don't need a history lesson. Thank you.
Very intriguing culture.
Descendants from the Portuguese explorers
and slaves from the Capeverdean islands.
I'm impressed!
I can google, too.
And that Father Kokou...
or...or whatever is a phony.
Did you check out that poncho he was wearing?
A grand boubou.
I said I know.
Oh, you knew? What that robe was called?
A "Boo-boo"?
Well, it's popular
with the Christians in West Africa.
Though the Swahili in East Africa
and some Bantu speakers in Central Africa also...
Like their boo-boos?
Yes.
That's not funny.
Okay.
Rizzoli.
Okay, give me the address.
Okay.
I'll see you back at the ranch.
I'm gonna go talk to the boy's father.
I'll get you a boubou.
Whoo-hoo!
A "Boo-boo"?
I tried to get Matt away from his mother
and that crazy Voodoo priest.
I should have taken him home.
Do you think that your ex-wife
may have had anytng to do
with Matt's death?
Not -- not Beatrice. No.
M-maybe the church.
You did everything you could, Malcolm.
And my son is dead.
When did your ex-wife join the church?
After the divorce.
That priest is a crook.
He got her to give him all of her money,
even the child support.
He spent every last dime on lawyers,
fighting for custody.
I mean, we even put off having our own children...
Alicia, I-I-I have a child already.
I know.
I had.
The judge was just about to rule in our favor.
We were gonna bring him home.
Get settled, be a family.
Dad's story checked out.
He was getting full custody.
So maybe the mom killed him.
Yeah, I'll e-mail the whole file to you.
Um, I'm guessing she's in the waitress-protection program,
And you're working here because...
you're her new bodyguard.
I'm working a case here, Rzzoli, undercover.
And you're undercover to get her...
beans-to-water ratio?
Someone's been stealing from her till.
I said I'd help her out.
I have a fresh batch of blondies,
my mother's recipe.
Do you want one?
Don't want to insult your mother.
I will insult your mother if it keeps my ass smaller.
I hear ya.
How much is missing?
$11.01 yesterday.
$14.99 the day before.
Wow. 26 whole dollars.
Now I understand why you don't have the time
to do homicide cases.
Hey!
I got a full load here!
And I'm in the middle of a trial.
You got time for blondies.
Oh, you're gonna tell me again how much you hate Grant?
You don't keep your mouth shut,
and I'll go tell her how much you like her.
This is a nasty custody battle.
Mom and her church against dad.
Something there?
Maybe. What did you got?
Tracking Matt's friends and, uh, child predators.
Okay.
Jane!
Hey, ma.
Look who I found in the lobby.
Well, you weren't answering your phone,
and the brand-new officer O'connor wouldn't let me up.
All right. Well, I'll talk to him.
Thanks.
Uh, hey, do you have Matt's autopsy report?
Yes, I'm waiting on tox and micros,
but I can tell you this conclusively,
it was not a natural death.
Really?
You could knock me over with a chicken feather.
Uh, and what are you doing here?
I, uh, brought you the dress
that you're going to wear tomorrow
when you come to dinner.
It's just the Solernos, mom.
So? You can't look nice?
Ooh. Look at this. Oh, wow.
Look at the detailed ottoman ribbing.
Yeah, it's got that, uh, grecian v-neck.
Oh, gorgeous woven-edge hem.
Jane.
Yeah.
Um, listen, when you two are done playing "Project Runway,"
I got work to do.
I know you always forget to eat.
Thank you.
I love you.
Love you.
Well, look at that.
Want some?
Is it okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Look at this.
Oh. What is that white substance?
Fluff.
Light, downy particles of cotton?
It's marshmallow.
And the brown subse is called peanut butter.
It's ground-up, heavy, oily particles of peanuts.
What, they didn't have that in your fancy boarding school?
Oh, it's really good.
Two hits on pedophiles that like Matt's type,
both in custody when he disappeared.
All right, what about his skateboarder friends?
Gang unit says Matt was hanging with some bad kids.
Ran the names,
they've all been brought up
on minor drug charges, except Matt.
This is the gang leader.
"Cruncha"?
A.K.A. Jerome, 18...
and the only adult.
He recruits juveniles on skateboards to run drugs for him?
Maybe Matt said no.
The origin of gang names is actually quite fascinating.
A nickname signifies a change in status or identity.
You're not a true member until you have a nickname.
Yo, Dr. Death.
Jane-lo needs a cause of death,
not a seminar on gangster nicknames.
Maybe there's something to what doc is saying.
Thank you.
If Matt had a nickname,
could mean he was in Cruncha's gang.
So maybe it's time to talk to Cruncha.
Yo.
Do you know this guy?
Yeah, that's, um, that's the homie Ollie right there, man.
We used to skate.
So Ollie was Mathias' nickname?
Yeah, he was, uh, he was bad on the board.
But, uh, I'm done talking to five-oh's.
So you can bother someone else, dude.
You mind, Jane?
I, uh...
didn't make it to the gym today.
Yeah, be my guest.
Let me go! Let me go, dude!
Let me go!
I'm not a dude. I'm a detective.
If you disrespect that, I will hurt you!
You got that?
You got that?!
Yes, I got it! I got it!
Now, your boy got killed out here.
Look, I ain't killed nobody, man.
You go ask his mother!
Crazy cape verdeans and they -- they hexes!
And -- they -- they evil, man!
Them brothers and sisters at that church are off the chain!
So, just let me go, man!
I didn't do nothin', man.
Get out. Get out of here.
So, what are you thinking?
My gut says he's right.
Church and the priest are evil,
but it's not enough for a warrant.
Nice move.
Another set of micro and tox reports came back.
All negative.
I could run tox screens every day,
every day for the rest of my life
and still not have a cause of death.
Gee, that's encouraging.
All right, what about, um, herbs
that they use in exorcisms?
Can you run those?
Yeah, already on it. It'll be in the next screening.
This is so frustrating. This poor kid!
Poor parents.
What is it?
Shh, shh, shh.
I hate snakes.
You can't take me off this case.
I'm not taking you off the case. Okay?
But you can't ignore a threat like that.
It's a crazy priest and some garden snakes!
Come on!
Yeah. I understand what it.
Hey, Jane, whoever did this covered the security lens
with spray paint.
No prints. Nothing on the tape.
Do exorcism priests tag?
Hey. Hey! No jokes.
Okay? This is a very dicey political situation.
We cannot be seen as persecuting a priest or the church.
What if he did it?
Come on, Joe, is that all you care about,
is how this is gonna affect your career?!
No, what I care about is you going about this in a smart way
so it sticks!
So you believe me?
Yes.
Get Kokou.
Just be careful.
Okay. Thank you.
Yet another tox report that came back negative.
He didn't die from an herb commonly used in exorcisms.
Well, look for the uncommon ones.
It's still thousands. We have to narrow it down.
Maura, I can't go after that priest
until I know what Matt died of.
Well, I'm not gonna guess.
All right, well, what if you were to guess?
Just hypothetically guess.
What would be your guess...
hypothetically?
I found several cases of people in the literature...
who were hexed to death.
Murder by hex.
All right, enough guessing.
Well-documented cases.
Victims who were so convinced that they were cursed
that they suffered
catastrophic catecholamine-induced arrhythmia.
I don't even know what that is.
Heart attack.
A heart attack because they were scared?
My kid didn't die of fear.
Well... Haven't you ever been afraid of anything?
Uh...Witches.
My family went to salem when I was little.
See? You were very impressionable.
Yes, I had to sleep with a night-light.
Why? What were you scared of?
Chromobacterium violaceum.
What's that?
It's a flesh-eating bacteria.
Crawls inside your ear or your nose,
and it starts eating you from the in...
Okay.
I-I got it.
Thank you.
It's horrible.
Every culture has an exorcism ceremony.
You know, and there's no law
against being a charismatic religious leader.
Yeah, yeah, like Jim Jones and Kool-aid
酷爱:一种兴奋剂
and David Koresh and Waco.
瓦柯:地名
What could go wrong?
I feel like going to church. You?
We're about to do a ceremony.
I'm about to serve a search warrant.
This is a very disruptive way to observe a foreign culture.
Well, at least one of us will fit in.
You could have told me you had a warrant.
She didn't.
We didn't have time.
You lied?
No.
I said I was about to serve a warrant.
I didn't say when.
Your rituals could seem as strange to others,
as ours do to you.
Blood into wine,
bread into flesh.
He's right.
It's no different than the poteau-mitan,
linking heaven and hell.
Is it?
You know about the poteau-mitan?
I spent two years in dakar
with the Medecins Sans Frontieres.
You were in doctors without borders?
Why can't you just say that?
Please.
Let us complete the ceremony,
help Sister Beatrice.
Then you can do your search.
Only if we can observe.
If you wish.
Don't worry.
No. Why worry?
We're just locked in a room with an ex-con
who's about to do an exorcism.
This is great.
Snakes!
She believes the devil that possessed her son
is inside of her.
Think of an exorcism as a...
as a massive therapeutic intervention.
Weapon.
Passed from her son's heart to her!
Liberam!
Liberam!
Get everybody out the back! Go!
Stop!
Where'd you get the sweatshirt?
My Homie Ollie gave it to me.
Right before you put a pillow over his head
and smothered him to death?
Look, I'm -- I'm a skater, not a killer.
That's cute, Jerome.
You just threw a molotov cocktail at a cop.
You think you can scare the cops off this case?
With some snakes and firebomb?
What are you talking about snakes, man?
Brother ain't messing with no damn snakes.
And the firebomb?
Look, the Voodoos killed Ollie.
I want a lawyer.
Okay, we're done.
Take him to lockup.
He has kids do petty crimes to cover for his ass,
but he throws a revenge bomb himself?
No. He didn't kill him.
So you make the priest for it?
Oh, big daddy voodoo isn't saving souls.
I haven't ruled out the parents, either.
Damn it. I am late for dinner.
My mom's gonna kill me!
You were firebombed, Jane.
It's a good excuse!
Yeah. You don't know my mother.
Will you call her and tell her I'm on my way?!
Okay?!
Yeah.
Come on.
Hi, ma.
I'm sorry.
No worries. I'm glad you're here.
Like it?
Yeah.
Help me out? Go entertain.
Okay, okay, okay.
Rizzoli.
Wow, you look amazing.
Thank you.
What the hell, ma?
Where's pa and the Solernos?
They went to go pick up ice cream for later!
No, they didn't.
There's no one else here?
I made ragu bolognese.
You made me wear this dress for Joe Grant?!
What? No!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ma!
I need to know you're taken care of.
By him?
Are you kidding?!
He's cute!
He's not cute!
He's very cute.
So what?!
Go!
You go!
Be a girl!
I love you.
So, I, uh, haven't seen you in a dress
since, what, senior prom?
With Charlie Krenz.
He was a dork.
Yeah, he was a dork.
What, are you gonna tell me I've filled out nicely?
Uh, and risk being brought up on, uh, harassment charges?
Uh...Maybe.
You look good.
I had no idea she was inviting you.
She didn't invite me. I broke in the window.
Yeah, you always were funny.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
How did she convince you to do this?
Your mom? You kidding me?
She, uh, she wouldn't take no for an answer.
She told me it was a reunion or something.
Yeah, apparently.
Yeah.
So, I, uh
heard about your little incident at the church.
You gonna write me up?
Maybe.
You gonna write me up, uh, for harassment?
Maybe.
But you'd have to do it first.
I think you look perfect.
Thank you.
Dinner's almost ready!
Set the table, Jane!
Okay!
I can't believe my mother.
Yeah. It's just the two of us, right?
Yeah.
My mother still... Oh...
Yeah.
My mother still likes to tell me when it's gonna rain outside,
that's why I bring an umbrella, you know?
Yeah.
No, no. She -- you know,
she just wants you to be happy. That's all.
Well, no offense, but I don't need a guy to make me happy.
And no one's proposing here, so...
What's that supposed to mean?
This is a bad idea, huh?
Yes. Yes.
It is a bad idea.
All right. Well...
Okay.
Tell your mother I said hi.
Tell her yourself.
Why are you laughing?
No.
I mean, se...do I look stupid?
No. Are you kidding?
Really, you don't know?
You're gorgeous, my friend.
Then why are you laughing?
Really? Okay. Well...
Tell my mother that.
She thinks I'm some sort of pity project.
She just loves you. That's all.
Want some cheese?
No.
Ew! No. Not out of the dead fridge. No.
If she loves me so much,
Why did she hand me off to that creep?
I don't believe you think he's a creep.
Well, I do.
I've known him since he was 5. You know he used to lisp.
So?
"So"?
You get rid of guys if they have receding gums.
That's true.
That is true.
But you're always complaining that the guys you date
don't understand or like your job,
and he respects you.
Stop.
Really.
You think he's this political animal,
but it's just that it comes out of him
when he's around you.
Because he wants to impress you.
It's mating behavior.
I think it's sweet.
I think you're insane.
I'm off to solve a murder.
Night-light on or off?
On.
I can't wait till we solve this one.
Thank you.
It's in there.
There are almost always explanations
for these phenomena.
Almost?
Well, maybe the dog knocked the flowers over.
Maura, it's four feet off the floor.
Hey, you know, maybe ghosts are real.
Maybe I could pick the winning lottery numbers today.
Maybe I am losing my mind.
I could do a brain scan if you like.
Thank you. That's...that's very helpful.
Thanks.
Can you run one more tox panel?
Okay.
What do you want me to look for?
I can't even believe I'm saying this.
Okay?
Purple poisonous plants.
Purple?
Yeah.
You said that Mathias was holding purple flowers.
Yeah.
Monkshood is a purple flowering plant
that grows in Boston.
Is it poisonous?
Yes.
And it works very quickly,
and it's extremely hard to detect.
But I can try.
Tox report on monkshood... positive.
Low levels were detected,
but enough to determine the cause of death.
Mathias was poisoned.
I know why I had that dream,
because I know where I've seen that plant before.
Can you type the genetics of the monkshood in Matt's body
and match it to the plant that it came from?
No.
Can you lie about that?
No. I don't lie.
Well, it's not a lie.
Well, yes, it is.
I know when it is. I start to hyperventilate.
Okay, it's a white lie.
It's still a lie.
you've never lied to a guy
and tell him he was good when he wasn't?
No.
Like this shirt with this jacket?
Not really. No.
We're sorry to tell you,
but your son was poisoned.
What? H-how?
Actually, with a...a plant like this one right here.
I didn't poison my son.
That church.
Beatrice's crazy church.
That's how they did it.
We don't think so.
What's interesting is that, uh,
Dr. Isles can type the genecs of plants,
which means she can match the monkshood
That was found in Matt's body
To the plant that it originally came from.
Isn't that right, Dr. Isles?
Yes. We do do genetic typing.
Basically, someone would just have to soak the monkshood
in a bottle of water.
Find Matt on his skateboard. Offer him a drink.
That's right.
This is crazy.
If...If I may.
Malcolm wouldn't have a child with you.
Is that right?
Wait. H-how do you know that?
It's in your custody papers.
It's one of the reasons that the judge gave you Matt.
It's because of your commitment to him.
There you have it. Right?
He didn't do it.
Yeah, you -- you didn't want another child.
You had Matt.
But you wanted one of your own, didn't you?
You knew that Malcolm was winning the custody battle.
And you knew it was never gonna happen.
No.
No.
You knew about the exorcisms because of the custody dispute,
and you figured that the church and his mom would be blamed.
Malcolm.
You know she never would have stopped fighting for custody.
And we would have spent all our money on the lawyers,
and it just was trapping us in the past,
And I swear, Malcolm,
I swear, I did it for us.
No!
No!
Hey! Hey!
No!
Mr. Senna! Mr. Senna, okay!
No! No!
Come on! Mr. Senna!
Malcolm, I'm sorry.
Calm down.
You have the right to remain silent.

Big job I wasn't expecting.

No.
Not that big.
