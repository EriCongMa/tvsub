the cure to vampirism .
you &apos;re gonna take the cure , elena .
and i &apos;m gonna take it with you .
but i can &apos;t let you do this ,
before you &apos;ve let everyone in your life
try to talk you out of it .
i &apos;m pregnant .
marry me .
yes .
if my life is gonna fall apart
when my humanity starts flooding back ,
then so is yours .
i tried to kill you ,
and then i made you turn it off , .
i ruined everything .
before the 1900s , lily fell in with a group of witches
that were cast out of the gemini coven .
heretics are ruthless ,
vampires with witch power .
they can never be allowed to escape .
it &apos;s time we get the hell out of this place .
you went off the deep end last night .
i &apos;m a mess .
you have no idea what devastation feels like ,
but you will .
elena ?
hello again , bonnie .
lily . i thought stefan locked you in the cellar .
he did , but prisons are easily escaped .
you of all people should know that .
what do you want ?
must i constantly repeat myself ?
if you don &apos;t know what i want by now--
you want your creepy witch vampire family back .
well , at the risk of repeating myself , there &apos;s no way .
isn &apos;t there ? what &apos;s that term
you witches are so fond of ? &quot; loophole &quot; ?
even if there is a loophole ,
i won &apos;t help you find it .
oh , you &apos;ve made your position quite clear .
apparently , i failed to do the same ,
because you seem to think that i &apos;m here for your help .
i &apos;m not .
phesmatos incendia .
those are lovely words , bonnie .
here &apos;s another one--die .
you are not good at running .
motus .
no magic ? oh , that &apos;s my fault .
i was spooning you earlier .
i think i might &apos;ve sleep @-@ siphoned you .
oh , but keep trying . it &apos;s adorable ,
like you &apos;re having a little seizure .
how are you--
did you think
you could keep screwing people over
and there wouldn &apos;t be any consequences ?
now ...
where were we ?
up , up , up . come on . no time to sleep in .
we have to get jo .
get jo ?
yeah .
is everything ok ?
i hope so , considering she &apos;s walking down the aisle
in t @-@ minus 10 hours .
come on .
wedding bells await .
crap .
they &apos;re not here .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my shoes . my gorgeous , ridiculously expensive ,
wear them once and then never again shoes . they are missing .
do you want me to do a locator spell on them ?
on my shoes ?
is that possible ?
i don &apos;t know , actually .
just hang on . i got to figure out how to work this stupid thing .
oh , good . break it
because my wrinkled dress will surely
distract everyone from my bare feet .
come on . don &apos;t waste all your panic now .
you still have 8 hours until the ceremony .
non @-@ alcoholic mimosa ?
one , a non @-@ alcoholic mimosa is just orange juice ,
and two , i can &apos;t drink .
somebody should drink . you should drink .
i will drink , eventually ,
but i have human tolerance now ,
which is cheaper but a lot less fun .
cheers .
no , no , no , no .
relax .
jo &apos;s phone .
uh , ok .
that &apos;s not an &quot; ok &quot; ok .
that &apos;s a &quot; there &apos;s a problem &quot; ok .
yeah , we &apos;ll call you back . ok , bye .
danielle &apos;s got the flu .
it sounded like you just said danielle has the flu ,
which is impossible because danielle is my wedding coordinator .
yeah .
well , how sick is she ? can she still work ?
it depends on how much vomit you want to have at the wedding .
to be honest , i think maybe this is a good thing ,
because no matter how good danielle was ,
i am pretty sure i &apos;m better .
caroline .
i missed you .
i missed me , too .
thank you for getting me back .
ok . now , we got a lot to do
and not a lot of time to do it .
elena , just have a drink .
you &apos;re not going to pass out .
bonnie , the switch is on the left @-@ hand side on the back .
and jo , i can see your shoes under the couch .
ok , now , who &apos;s dealing with the boys ?
ok , we got suits .
i got the rings .
and the vows .
so ... what do we do now ?
to alaric saltzman ,
who after today , will have sex with
only one woman for the rest of his life .
seriously , just one .
you can &apos;t even look after this .
not that chicks are throwing themselves
at an occult studies professor , but--
yeah , actually , you should probably lock this down while you can .
yeah , you remember how great it was when you two were fighting ?
sorry . full moon tonight .
feeling extra dickish .
and what &apos;s your excuse ?
what ? what is it ?
wedding day chores .
courtesy of caroline .
karma . sweet , sweet karma .
ok , the boys are officially taken care of .
bride and maid of honor are in hair and makeup .
i &apos;m gonna head to the venue and fix whatever they &apos;re screwing up .
elena , the curling iron .
yes , is , i see it , care .
ok .
i &apos;m human now , not blind .
and i &apos;m not fragile , either .
you don &apos;t have to walk on eggshells around me .
uh , i do , actually ,
because if you walked on them ,
they could cut you , you &apos;d get infected , and probably die .
you know what ?
given my luck ,
that actually seems possible .
so what &apos;s it like now in the world of the living ?
it &apos;s different . i &apos;m slower .
i have to look both ways before crossing the street .
but it &apos;s nice to not--
be a monster like me
who turns off their humanity and commits murder
instead of dealing with grief like a normal person ?
i was gonna say not to have to wear a daylight ring all the time .
look , i &apos;m so sorry , elena ,
i was trying to hurt you
when i said that you would never truly be happy with damon
because you weren &apos;t human .
and now you are ,
and i just hope that it &apos;s not because i made you think that
you would be miserable for eternity .
care . i &apos;ve wanted to be human from the day i became a vampire .
besides , i &apos;m the last person that you need to apologize to .
thanks . i kind of wanted to start with an easy one .
the dreaded amends tour .
if you see stefan , by the way , i am avoiding .
i just need to get my life in order first .
starting with my friends .
stefan &apos;s not a friend ?
stefan &apos;s ... complicated .
i just figured i &apos;d work my way up to that one .
well , you &apos;re in the clear .
he &apos;s got his hands full with damon today .
what &apos;s wrong with damon ?
not much . he just said he would take the cure with me .
damon salvatore ?
human ? i--
i can &apos;t even picture it .
yeah . something tells me neither can he .
&quot; sure , i &apos;ll be your best man , ric ,
but first , hang out with the worst men
so that my brother can kidnap me on the day of your wedding . &quot;
hey , don &apos;t you hate weddings anyway ?
i hate little stefan mind games even more .
so any time you want to clue me in as to where the hell we &apos;re going .
oh , come on . it &apos;s your last few days as a vampire .
you can &apos;t blame me for wanting to spend
some quality time with my brother .
ah , look . here we are .
is mr. rogers expecting us ?
you know mr. rogers is dead , right ?
yeah , we &apos;re gonna be joining him in make @-@ believe
if you don &apos;t get to the damn point .
so this is a house i lived in
during one of my many attempts to start over .
welcome to your suburban nightmare .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ve thought this through ?
well , i think you &apos;ve thought about a life with elena .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ve thought about neighbors
or a mortgage or--
or kids .
i don &apos;t know .
might not be your thing .
relax . relax .
i &apos;m not here to cause mischief .
said everyone who ever causes mischief .
i told lily i &apos;d visit .
is this like some oedipus thing ?
all right . you know what ? doesn &apos;t matter .
excuse me , little witch .
if you think i &apos;m gonna let you--
a ruiner--in here to see another ruiner
on the day of jo &apos;s wedding ,
you got another thing coming .
she &apos;s lonely and hungry .
and she can &apos;t eat that .
i &apos;m not trying to feed her .
i &apos;m trying to keep her sane .
that is filled with loads of songs from the last era she knew .
i thought it might bring her comfort .
if you &apos;re not a complete monster ,
i trust you &apos;ll pass it on .
i want my family back .
that &apos;s all i &apos;ve ever wanted ,
to have my family back with me where they belong .
what ?
she was rambling on about her family ,
and then i got close to her ,
and she attacked me like an animal .
sounds like she &apos;s reached the full @-@ blown crazy stage of drying out .
you &apos;re saying this is all because she &apos;s drying out ?
it &apos;s hard for me to explain how awful it is ,
but , yeah , your mind starts playing tricks on you .
you start seeing things and people .
what happens when the crazy stage is over ?
well , stefan said that he has a plan ,
you know , to get her back on track .
does that plan involve letting her out ?
because if he thinks she &apos;s giving up on her family--
she has to .
bonnie , you already destroyed the ascendant .
what if there &apos;s a loophole ?
i &apos;m dreading it ,
but i guess i should think about putting the dress on .
something &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s not the dress , is it ?
tell me it &apos;s not the dress .
we were just discussing the fact
that there &apos;s a desiccating vampire locked in a cell
less than 50 feet from where we &apos;re getting ready .
did she do something to the dress ?
the dress is fine .
i &apos;m just being paranoid .
ok . truck &apos;s here . who &apos;s coming ?
caroline suggested in a semi @-@ threatening way
that i pick up the centerpieces ,
which sounds like a donovan screw @-@ up waiting to happen .
i &apos;ll come !
thank you .
yeah .
no , not there . there .
just a little bit higher .
well , that &apos;s not a little , but--
but i &apos;m bad at flowers ?
yeah . i assumed you knew that .
caroline , why am i here ?
i tried to kill you .
my humanity was off , but i still tried to kill you ,
and you &apos;re my friend , and i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s funny .
you and i moved on a while ago ,
but getting tortured by your ex and her new boyfriend
is never good for the ego .
he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
whatever he is .
i can &apos;t keep up .
you have to know i would never do anything like that
if it weren &apos;t for--
you &apos;re good , care ,
and if you want to make amends ,
let me get the hell out of here .
nice try , ok ,
but if i were getting married at an altar that looked like that ,
i would be divorced in a week ,
so come on , lockwood .
next row .
honestly , you should probably do that yourself .
liv , what are you doing here ?
you do know that jo &apos;s my sister , right ?
goodie ! more amends .
drinks will help ! strong ones .
you look good .
thanks .
how are things ?
good .
still recovering from that injury ?
what injury ?
whatever head injury turned you into a monosyllabic goon .
monosyllabic . that &apos;s an awfully big word for a college dropout .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . was i supposed to stay at whitmore
after my ass of a boyfriend told me he never wanted to see me again ?
hang on . you &apos;re mad at me ?
i lost my brother and then my boyfriend in the span of a week .
and instead of coming to me ,
you tried to kill yourself .
i was hurt .
that doesn &apos;t make it ok .
you &apos;re lecturing me on flying off the handle ?
you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna wait outside .
gemini wedding means big coven reunion heading this way .
elena says she &apos;s desiccating
and that &apos;s why she &apos;s crazy , but--
yeah .
she killed two people last week when she wasn &apos;t desiccating .
i know this will sound crazy ,
but i &apos;ve been having these nightmares
with her and kai .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
when bonnie bennett has a hunch ,
you don &apos;t ignore it .
what do you think we should do ?
i know what we shouldn &apos;t do--
leave her in the hands of two people we don &apos;t trust .
yeah , it &apos;s nice .
brazilian hardwoods ,
open floor plan ,
updated kitchen .
what kind of roadkill are you cooking in there ?
well , considering the fact that you actually have to eat as a human ,
i just wanted to give you a little taste
of what your dinner &apos;s gonna look like .
you don &apos;t cook , elena doesn &apos;t cook .
who has time anyway with work and kids , right ?
salisbury steak . dig in , damon .
you &apos;re gonna need all that energy for these .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s just the rest of your life .
paperwork ? that &apos;s your big move ?
let me ask you something .
when was the last time you filled out paperwork of any kind--
taxes , health insurance , driver &apos;s license ?
every idiot in the country does it .
you think i &apos;m gonna have trouble with this ?
you will the first time you encounter some moron
that you can &apos;t kill or compel .
maybe . then i would just come home
and pop a beer from my beautiful stainless steel refrigerator .
which you won &apos;t be able to afford unless you have a job ,
and if you &apos;re about to say you can borrow money from me ,
you can &apos;t .
well , that &apos;s not very brotherly of you .
actually it is . see ,
i won &apos;t know where you live .
you &apos;ll have the cure running through your veins ,
and if i know where you are ,
then someone can use me to track you down
and take the cure from you
and turn you into a 172 @-@ year @-@ old corpse .
what &apos;s the matter ? haven &apos;t thought that far ahead ?
see , eventually , word will spread ,
and you and elena will have to move away .
you &apos;ll have to isolate yourself ,
no friends , no family .
this will be your life , damon .
this will be your hell .
well , that is where you are wrong , my brother .
this will not be my life .
this will be my life .
see , elena was pretty explicit about what she wanted .
now this isn &apos;t tribeca .
new york &apos;s a little too crowded for me ,
but it is above a bar that i own
next to a medical school .
it &apos;s in the northwest somewhere .
i mean , i &apos;d tell you where it was ,
but you made it abundantly clear you didn &apos;t want to know .
i &apos;m gonna check out upstairs .
i &apos;m on my third glass , so speak slowly .
you know how you and i were both worried
that he didn &apos;t think this through ?
he thought it through .
it &apos;s damon . he didn &apos;t .
he &apos;s ready to do this , elena .
he &apos;s got your perfect little life all planned out .
i want the perfect human life with him , too , stefan , trust me ,
but life isn &apos;t perfect .
ok ? look . you have a few more hours ,
so push him , make him see that .
remember when you were pacing yourself ?
i do .
right before i told my ex @-@ boyfriend
how to get my current boyfriend
to give up hope for our relationship .
what if i made a huge mistake by taking the cure ?
the only mistake you made
was that last glass of champagne .
i &apos;m gonna go make some coffee
before you spiral through the earth to china .
yeah , ok .
jo ?
are you ok ?
jo !
hey , jo , jo !
jo ! jo !
the doctor got the test results back .
the babies are fine , you &apos;re fine .
he thinks it was just--
an acute panic attack
brought on by stress , pregnancy ,
and a severe lack of food .
yeah .
what are the chances of you being an amazing maid of honor
and keeping this mortifying episode to yourself ?
i don &apos;t want to worry ric .
of course .
you can &apos;t tell her that i told you .
ok . fine , but i want to see her .
not till the wedding .
elena !
ric , if there &apos;s anywhere that you should be superstitious ,
it &apos;s mystic falls .
ok . fine , but what happened ?
the doctors think that she had a panic attack .
as in she doesn &apos;t want to get married to me panic attack ? great .
no , as in it &apos;s her wedding day
and she has two small humans growing inside her
and she can &apos;t self @-@ medicate like you , bourbon breath .
sorry . i just--i saw her fall ,
and my first instinct was to vamp to her ,
but i couldn &apos;t ,
and then i saw her hit her head ,
and i wanted to give her vampire blood ,
but i couldn &apos;t .
wait . so are you having second thoughts ?
no , because then i thought ,
&quot; what would a human do ? &quot;
so i called 911 , got her to the hospital ,
and then i let the doctors do their job ,
and it felt oddly empowering .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
tell you what ?
how amazing it feels to be human again .
at first , i was worried that it might take the edge off my senses ,
but it &apos;s the opposite .
i feel ...
connected to the world again .
i feel ...
alive ?
yeah .
that &apos;s because your life has purpose again .
it &apos;s finite ,
and it &apos;s ...
pretty much the greatest feeling in the whole world .
i made you guys some amazing drinks
with a little bit of tequila .
ok . a lot of tequila .
and there &apos;s only one of you .
what did you do ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
he said angrily .
nothing has changed .
what ? because she walks in here
with a pretty dress and a new haircut ,
i &apos;m supposed to forget how she acted ?
no . you &apos;re supposed to talk to her like an adult
and work out your problems .
you don &apos;t know about our problems .
no , but i know about your problems--
unless you &apos;re cool with
only making it two weeks in the police academy
and then having no purpose in life .
at least when you had her ,
you were trying , tyler .
you &apos;re giving me advice about relationships
after all your stefan drama this year ?
do me a favor . figure out your own damn life .
let me worry about mine .
well , i applaud you for your effort , stefan ,
but i think it &apos;s time for the &quot; this is your life &quot; tour to end .
you get the address ?
yep . tuxes are in the car .
we &apos;re good to go .
good .
just one more thing .
what now ?
you gonna give me a lecture on laundry ,
oil changes , personal hygiene ?
breakups .
what about them ?
well , i guess you hadn &apos;t really thought about that , right ?
what if you and elena aren &apos;t really soul mates ?
you know i &apos;m not very big on labels , bro ,
but i think we &apos;re pretty good on that front .
yeah . you sound like me 4 years ago .
you know , elena and me , we were soul mates , too .
watch it , stefan .
i &apos;m just being realistic .
i mean , what if something goes wrong ?
you &apos;re still human , still isolated ,
still alone .
not gonna happen .
right because couples stay together forever .
they never fight , they never hurt each other ,
they never drift apart .
let me show you .
you &apos;re still up .
rough night ?
just ... long .
i keep having to tell myself
a couple more years of residency ,
and i &apos;ll be free .
come sit , have a drink with me .
i &apos;m actually kind of tired .
i &apos;m gonna go to bed .
oh , god ! elena has a job . somebody , help me !
oh , that &apos;s just two years in .
wait till you hit 7 .
hello .
you &apos;re drunk .
i sense judgment , which is odd .
you &apos;re the one that wanted me to own a bar .
i wanted you to own it , damon ,
not pass out on it every night .
yeah ? well , that bar &apos;s a lot more affectionate than you .
i just finished my residency , damon .
i &apos;m working my butt off to build a career .
well , i &apos;m drinking my butt off building mine .
if you &apos;re that unhappy , then just sell the bar .
and do what ?
i don &apos;t care , damon .
whatever it is you want to do .
well , that &apos;s the thing , elena .
i can &apos;t do what i want to do
because what i want to do is drink all night
without getting drunk ,
drive my car like a psycho
without fear of death .
i want to tear someone &apos;s head off
without getting arrested .
you &apos;re right , damon .
you can &apos;t do any of those things anymore .
because of you .
i can &apos;t because of you .
just say it .
this was a damn mistake .
you &apos;re right .
this was a mistake .
get out of my head !
i see what you &apos;re doing .
this isn &apos;t about me being alone .
this is about you being alone
without me , without elena .
awfully selfish of you brother .
even if you and elena defy every single statistic
and stay in love every hour of every day ...
you still can &apos;t control life or death .
she &apos;s human . she could die at any moment .
what is your life gonna look like
without her ?
so you make us drift apart ,
break us up , and then kill her ?
that &apos;s harsh , brother .
she wanted me to be harsh .
this is her idea , too .
well , that &apos;s funny
because the two people closest to me
are the two most sadistic .
you know , if you do this , damon , you &apos;re human forever .
no matter what happens , there &apos;s no going back .
what do you think i should do ?
that &apos;s the thing . i can &apos;t tell you ,
elena can &apos;t tell you .
you can &apos;t do this for me or for her .
you have to want to be human for yourself .
oh , excuse me . they need some more drinks over there .
thank you .
where &apos;s jo ? is she--
she &apos;s fine . they discharged her .
good . well , there &apos;s a back entrance she can use that avoids being seen .
ok . i &apos;ll tell her .
great .
stefan .
i &apos;m gonna go wait for jo .
ok .
i &apos;m not used to scaring people away .
people are uncomfortable around salvatores in tuxes .
it stirs ...
feelings .
elena &apos;s human again .
am i sensing another brother swap ?
is he with you ?
no . he needed some time to think .
that sounds very ominous .
you don &apos;t want him to take it , do you ?
well , it &apos;s not up to me .
stefan , i &apos;m not him .
you can tell me how you really feel .
look . of course , i don &apos;t want him to take it .
he &apos;s my brother .
the thought of losing him is--
yeah , i know .
so what do you think he &apos;s gonna do ?
well , you never knew damon as a human .
he was aimless ,
always searching for something more ,
sweet and earnest to a fault
but never strong .
that came later when he found himself ,
when he truly became damon .
he loves being a vampire ,
and i just don &apos;t think he &apos;ll ever give that up .
she &apos;s gonna kill us .
i thought the whole point of this
is that we were in control of her .
not lily . caroline .
the wedding starts in an hour .
all we have to do is knock her ass out
and drag her to the boiler room .
30 minutes tops .
bonnie .
enzo must have let her out .
i have to warn everyone .
matt ?
matt , what &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t breathe .
it &apos;s like someone &apos;s crushing my throat .
ok . just hang on . i &apos;ll--
matt .
tea , please . earl grey .
and to what do i owe the pleasure ?
i heard you tried to bring me something called an , uh , mp3 player .
i &apos;m not entirely sure what that is ,
but still , i wanted to thank you .
and they let you out of your cell to do this ?
of course not ,
but i &apos;m resourceful .
should i be concerned
about an imminent ripper binge ?
actually , no , you shouldn &apos;t .
i was a ripper because i lost my family ,
but today , i &apos;m getting them back .
if you &apos;re trying to organize a secret rendezvous--
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not .
i just need help with my vows .
what rhymes with battlefield clamp ?
divorce ?
so how are yours coming ?
stop fishing for spoilers .
you know , this place is crawling with gemini .
who knew there were so many of you ?
well , there &apos;s not much to do in the coven other than procreate .
you haven &apos;t seen my dad , have you ?
no , actually ,
but it &apos;s big of you to invite your attempted murderer to your wedding .
he gives really good gifts .
oh , and never say , &quot; big of you , &quot;
to a pregnant woman .
i hate that i can &apos;t see you right now .
i love that you hate it .
see you soon .
bye .
maybe i should just , uh ,
leave my gift and go then .
dad .
what are you doing back here ?
you &apos;re my daughter ,
and i , um-
i don &apos;t expect you to say yes ,
but ...
if i didn &apos;t at least ask to walk you down the aisle ,
i couldn &apos;t live with myself .
you &apos;re avoiding me .
what ? ! no . i &apos;m not avoiding you .
i &apos;m trying to organize this whole circus here .
i mean , did you see where they put the bar ?
caroline ...
can we talk ?
all right . just say it .
i &apos;m wrong , i &apos;m making this about me ,
i &apos;m being selfish .
no . sorry . not wanting to lose your brother
is pretty low on the selfish scale .
forcing someone to turn off their humanity on the other hand , that--
yeah . that &apos;s , uh-- that &apos;s way up there .
yeah .
do you hate me ?
no . of course , i don &apos;t hate you .
that doesn &apos;t mean that i don &apos;t hate the way you handled things .
well , that makes two of us .
i made a list ...
of , um , all the things that i &apos;ve done since i fell for you .
it started last summer when you moved away .
i started obsessing over where you were ,
wondering why you weren &apos;t returning my calls .
i told you i hated you when i felt ignored ,
missed my mom &apos;s final moments because i was kissing you ,
and then she died ...
caroline .
and all i needed
was for you to tell me that you felt something for me ,
and you didn &apos;t ,
and it affected me so deeply that
i did the worst possible thing a vampire can do .
i turned off my humanity ,
and when i thought i couldn &apos;t do anything else ,
i got you to turn off yours .
well , i forgive you .
yeah , but that &apos;s the point , stefan .
the old caroline wouldn &apos;t have forgiven me .
she would have smacked me and said ,
&quot; what the hell are you doing ? &quot;
i hate the way that this has made me feel .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re a control freak who &apos;s lost control .
i feel the same way when i &apos;m around you .
that &apos;s what falling for somebody is .
it &apos;s being vulnerable .
it &apos;s ...
giving up control .
i know ...
but where i &apos;m at right now in my life
with the guilt and the grief ,
control is all i have ,
and i don &apos;t think that i can give that up .
isn &apos;t a bridesmaid &apos;s dress supposed to
make you look like a freak of nature ?
jo went easy on me .
i talked to stefan .
he did not go easy on me .
apparently , that &apos;s your fault .
his argument was pretty convincing .
i &apos;d made up my mind ...
but then ...
you ruined my ball !
well , you &apos;re lucky i didn &apos;t ruin your face !
go inside , get the car keys from your mommy .
i &apos;m going to a wedding .
on second thought .
don &apos;t forget the--
the leftovers .
i know . you told me 3 times .
40 years , and every time ,
&quot; did you remember the leftovers ? &quot;
like i &apos;m getting senile or something .
i &apos;m taking it .
i &apos;ve been a vampire for a long time , elena .
it &apos;s been a blast ,
but i would give it up in a second to be your husband ,
your partner ,
father of your kids .
you can &apos;t take it just for me .
that &apos;s what you and stefan keep saying ,
but you &apos;re wrong .
i can .
i can take it for us .
ok ?
because even if it doesn &apos;t work ,
even if all goes to hell ,
even if i &apos;m miserable and alone ,
the smallest chance at the perfect life with you
is infinitely better than an immortal one without you ,
and i know this , elena .
i love you ...
and i will love you until i take my last breath on this earth .
where the hell are you ?
bonnie and matt are already m.i.a. ,
and now you and damon ?
what is wrong with you ? this is a wedding .
this is supposed to be jo &apos;s magical night ,
and you are ruining it .
we &apos;re starting without you .
this is not funny .
it &apos;s kind of funny .
look . i don &apos;t want to tell you how to run your wedding , but--
we &apos;re not waiting anymore !
tell them to cue the music .
um , i think it &apos;s starting .
what ? no .
what time is it ?
oh , my god . no . no , no , no . we &apos;re so late .
well , you &apos;re the one that couldn &apos;t keep your paws off of me .
damon , put your tux back on .
i am , i am .
well , i hope it was worth it .
actually ...
gross . not the time , ok ?
have you seen bonnie or matt ?
they &apos;re not here yet ?
just go , go . go , go , go .
ok .
bonnie .
bonnie .
it was ...
and so ?
looks like i &apos;m joining the human club .
it &apos;s a big night for both of us .
i &apos;m proud of you .
you , too , buddy .
welcome , family and friends ,
on this magical evening
to the wedding of alaric saltzman
and josette laughlin .
josette and alaric have prepared their own vows .
this can &apos;t be it . no one &apos;s here .
perhaps your companions gave you the wrong address .
they &apos;re not the ones who gave me the address .
then who did ?
neither one of us should be here right now .
we &apos;ve spent our lives dodging fate
and beating the odds ,
but because we did ,
i got to meet you ,
the most beautiful ,
hilarious ,
and intimidatingly brilliant woman
i have ever known .
you inspire me .
you &apos;ve shown me that happiness
is actually something that i can have in my life .
and so ...
i promise to be with you
and love you
and to dodge fate with you
for the rest of our lives .
josette ?
oh , god . that &apos;s a tough act to follow .
here goes .
alaric saltzman , you are--
jo ? what is it ?
jo ? oh , my god .
jo ?
oh , god . no !
no !
no , no , no , no .
oh my god . no , no no no .
i was gonna wait till the &quot; death do us part &quot; bit ,
but it seemed a little on the nose .
am i right ?
miss me ?
no ?
oh , well .
