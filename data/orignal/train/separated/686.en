What on earth have you done?
I was contacted at the office by a woman
who told me they were holding my father
and that he'd be safe
as long as I did what they told me to.
You're selling your share
of the stowaway back to Jack.
It'll work because he trusts me.
That's impossible. Where did you get this?
That's not important. The fact that I have it is.
So it has been you all this time.
Now you're walking away?
The other side possessed leverage which, shall we say,
rendered the fight too costly.
Hey. Let's say somebody was able to remove
this leverage you're talking about.
We never had this conversation.
With this ring, you'll be in my life forever.
Smile, Mr. and Mrs. Porter.
Jack?
Hey, Jack. Come in, it's Dec.
Sacrifice...
by its strictest definition...
Takes something precious
in exchange for the appeasement of a higher power...
An abiding devotion to a cause
that cannot be satisfied with a simple promise.
Because an oath...
no matter how solemn...
asks nothing in return.
While true sacrifice...
demands unspeakable loss.
Well, Mrs. Porter,
it has been a perfect day.
And night.
Married eight hours,
and already you're tired of kissing your wife?
No, no, no, no, no. Not at all. No. Never.
I'm just exhausted...
and hot.
It's cooler under the stars.
Should we take it back upstairs?
Let's go.
Well, congratulations, Victoria.
With one bullet, you've slaughtered us all.
The bitch had it coming.
What are we gonna do with her?
I--
Oh, great.
It's her chauffeur.
Apparently, he's growing impatient in our driveway.
Turn that off. They can track it.
Not yet.
Unroll the carpet.
What on god's earth for?
I have a plan. Give me her phone.
Oh, this unseasonal heat is absurd.
I take it that you disposed of your clothes last night?
Permanently.
Good.
The staff will be here any minute.
You've ordered the staff back?
Of course.
One night without the help is suspect enough.
Besides, we have a Labor Day party to prepare.
This really is business as usual for you two, isn't it?
Precisely the point.
Canceling at the last minute would draw unwanted attention.
And I'm instating a moratorium
on this "you two" business, Daniel.
It's time you stopped blaming us
and started shouldering some responsibility.
What, like you shouldered the responsibility
for bringing down that plane 20 years ago?
Oh, wait. You let David Clarke do that for you.
So tell me,
who's gonna be shouldering the responsibility
for the murder of Helen Crowley?
Oh, as fate would have it,
a certain treacherous young bride
has made that a very simple choice for all of us.
Amanda Clarke?
Are you serious?
She is Charlotte's sister, for god sake.
What she is is a vicious opportunist
who has unleashed holy hell on this family
for a year and a half.
She could give a damn about Charlotte.
Only her twisted vendetta against us.
Yeah, a vendetta that's completely justified.
Perhaps.
But she's no innocent.
Now Amanda has threatened us with evidence
that would send us to our graves.
So if dispatching her to the Initiative
is the only way to win this war,
so be it.
Now before she died,
Helen showed me a video feed of your office.
and we're going to use it to our advantage.
I'll meet you in my car in half an hour.
Daniel...
In my office, if you would, Ms. Davenport.
Enlighten me, Conrad.
What required my presence in this godforsaken house
at this godforsaken hour?
Well, I've decided to change the date
of my gubernatorial announcement to, uh... this evening.
You've got to be kidding me.
I assure you, I am not in a joking mood.
This is about Amanda Clarke, isn't it?
I know she blackmailed you into giving up the Stowaway.
I was standing right outside the door when she did it.
What does she have on you?
Well, instead of concerning yourself with the what,
I suggest you focus on the who.
Ms. Clarke has in her possession the ability
to dismantle my entire campaign.
All the more reason to postpone the announcement.
Oh, I'm afraid that's not an option.
Therefore I strongly recommend
that you use everything in your sizeable bag of tricks
to prevent any further interference from Amanda Clarke.
Welcome to my ultra-private,
completely untraceable mobile conference room.
Or local tavern, in your case.
What are you doing at the Stowaway?
Well, I told our favorite lovebirds
that I'd watch the bar while they're away... nesting.
What's your 20, Mr. Bean?
That's confidential.
You know the rules.
1,000 feet from the beach house at all times.
Have to keep out of the way of prying Grayson eyes.
Well, Daniel's eyes aren't prying so much as drifting
as of late.
Look, forgive me.
But wasn't the whole purpose of snuggling back up with Daniel
to get in with the Initiative?
Yes, one of them, but--
Well, then there's another angle we've yet to explore.
Padma.
Uh, no. Absolutely not.
I am not putting her in any more danger
than she's already in.
And I don't trust her.
See? Off-limits.
Why? Look, it's too late to save her from the Initiative.
She's already in their grasp.
But if the story about her father's kidnapping is true,
then we might actually be able to save him... and her.
He is right, Nolan.
If you really want to help Padma and her father,
no one's better equipped to do that than Aiden.
I gotta go.
Ashley.
What a surprise.
I know. It's been a long time.
That's not what I meant.
What are you doing here?
Sharing concern about a mutual friend.
I think Amanda Clarke might be in over her head
with the Graysons.
She ruined an important deal I'd been brokering
for the sale of the Stowaway by blackmailing Conrad.
Amanda, blackmail? I find that hard to believe.
And I would agree with you if I hadn't seen it for myself.
She stormed over unannounced
and showed Conrad something on her laptop
that caused him to pull a complete 180
against his own interests.
What was on the computer?
He didn't say.
But if Amanda's planning a war against the Graysons,
then she's making a terrible mistake.
That sounds like a threat.
It's the truth.
Those people are capable of more
than you and Amanda could possibly imagine.
I'll talk to her.
Good.
Emily...
Thanks for the heads-up, Ashley.
Damn it, Amanda. What have you done?
Good morning, husband.
We overslept.
I miss our little alarm clock.
You want to radio home and check on Carl
while I get us underway?
Yep.
Then I'm gonna cook you a big, greasy breakfast,
Captain Porter.
I can't believe we're really married!
Babe.
Who's been smoking on the...
Hey, Jack.
Nice day for a sail, huh?
Well, I hate to interrupt the honeymoon,
but this really couldn't wait.
Okay. Whatever it is, put the gun down,
and let's talk.
Sorry, J.P., no can do.
You forced my hand when you got Conrad
to back out of our deal.
He says you two idiots
have got some kind of leverage over him.
What leverage?
A friend lent me the money to buy him out.
End of story.
Not according to Grayson.
Sounds like somebody's getting played.
Amanda... get him on the phone.
I'm sure we can sort this out.
Okay, fine.
Sit down. Let's go. Have a seat.
Please tell me you don't know what he's talking about.
We do not want to mess with this guy.
He's seriously deranged.
He would have no problem hurting either one of us.
Hurting us?
Jack, the guy snuck on our boat with a gun.
He's gonna kill us
unless we kill him first.
Hey, hey, hey. Enough chitchat.
I can't get a damn signal out here.
If you let me sail us closer to shore,
you'll get a few bars.
Okay. That's a good idea, Gilligan.
No, no, no, no. You sit down. I got this.
You. You come with me.
Come on.
Let's go.
Don't try to be a hero, okay?
Hey, Charlotte. What are you up to?
I am making a slide show for Jack and Amanda.
Isn't she just the most gorgeous bride?
She certainly wears my earrings better than I do.
But I was actually hoping to get them back.
Um, you haven't seen them, have you?
Afraid not, but feel free to look for them.
Just try to keep it down, 'cause Carl's napping.
Oh, sorry.
But not for long if that stupid
air conditioner seriously just broke again.
Keep an eye on him for a sec while I look for Declan?
Yeah, of course.
Oh, my god.
Nate Ryan?
This guy is bad news. What the hell is he doing?
I don't know.
Amanda stole my computer so that she could
threaten Conrad into selling back the Stowaway.
Nate got nothing.
Yeah, I'll tell you what Nate's got--
A serious criminal record.
He's dangerous.
We need to contact them.
Yeah, well, both their phones are off the grid.
Declan says they haven't answered the radio
since they set sail.
I talked to the hotel in Nantucket,
and they said Jack and Amanda haven't checked in.
Hey, what about Jack and Amanda?
Oh, I was... Just telling Emily
that, uh, I talked to the hotel,
and our newlyweds are firmly ensconced
in their honeymoon suite
with a "Do not disturb" sign on the door.
That's a relief. Thank you, Nolan.
Um, you don't know how to fix an air conditioner, do you?
Okay. I don't know why I ask you.
We need to find Nate.
Do you have his cell phone number?
We can trace it.
I'll get it from Jack's cloud.
Okay, here we go.
Tracking now.
Nate's cell phone's out of range.
But the last time it sent a signal was...
Halfway to Nantucket?
We need a boat.
Biscotti from Stefania's.
Best in the city.
Oh, thanks. That's my favorite.
I should've had you join me instead.
I was expecting Helen Crowley for a breakfast meeting
that she requested, but she never showed.
Oh, would you like me to give her a try?
Yeah, just call and confirm that she'll be coming tonight
to the Labor Day party.
We can talk there.
Ms. Crowley is preoccupied
with a more pressing matter at the moment.
You've spoken to her?
Oh, yes.
She came over to the house last night.
It seems someone tipped her off
to the evidence I've been holding.
And let me guess.
Forced you at gunpoint to hand it over?
No, I gave it to her willingly to save you.
This story gets more and more ridiculous
every time you open your mouth.
You never had any evidence against Helen Crowley
Because there never was any conspiracy against you.
You know damn well I was never in any danger.
You read the file that I gave you yesterday, Daniel.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
And everything in it's a big lie.
Listen, all Helen's company is guilty of
is nearly doubling the size of our fund.
And you knew that if you spoiled my relationship with them,
dad could take back Grayson Global.
Oh, you need to pull the wool from your eyes.
No, I need to pull you from my life.
Grace, can you get security down here?
Conserve your security, Daniel.
With friends like Helen, you're going to need it.
I'm looking for Nolan Ross.
Yeah, if you find him, tell him he's fired.
Padma just walked in.
It's for you.
Padma, it's me.
Thank god. Where are you?
I had an unrelated emergency that required my immediate attention.
The guy who handed you the phone--Aiden Mathis?
He's a friend.
I remember him. He worked with Daniel Grayson.
How do you know we can trust him?
Because the same people who took your father
kidnapped his sister.
You're in good hands, I promise. I have to go.
This interruption had better be warranted.
Well, you tell me, Conny.
I'm holding court with the Porters as we speak.
Your story and Jack's aren't exactly matching up.
Oh, well, that's because,as always,
the wife is the source of the issue,
leaving the husband blissfully ignorant of the mess
he'll have to answer for.
Wait. Are you telling me that Amanda's the one
that's got your neck in a vice, not Jack?
What I'm telling you is
that girl is in possession of a laptop that belongs to me.
Now if you can return it intact,
I'll see to it that your own ambitions are rewarded
far beyond your current ability to imagine.
Uh, Mr. Ryan, I will need assurances that she has neither the intention
nor the ability to ever come after me again.
Don't worry about it. She won't.
Grayson told me about the computer that you swiped.
We can do this the easy way,
or your new husband can catch a bullet.
Do you understand me?
Fine. You win. It's yours.
Good.
Just promise me you won't hurt Jack.
Cross my heart, hope to die.
What are you doing?
It's in my backpack.
Oh,yeah,go ahead.
No bullets.
You think I'm stupid, huh?
You don't think that I checked this boat before we shoved off?
I took you at your word when you threatened to kill me
for putting Jacky boy in the slammer.
I guess now...
I can break that little promise I just made, huh?
No,stop. Leave Jack out of this.
Getting together with Jack was just my excuse to stay in the Hamptons
while I collected evidence to bring down the Graysons.
What are you talking about?
They murdered my father and got away with it scot-free.
I'm here for payback,
something you and I both have in common.
Come on. Be smart about this.
You do this for Grayson,
his next move is to hang you out to dry.
Please, please, please be here.
I've got the proof. You've got the muscle.
Together we can bring these people to their knees.
Squeeze them for every penny if that's what you want.
Thank you, Declan.
Okay, fine.
But I want to see what's on that computer first,
and then we'll talk.
It's not here. It's in Montauk.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold everything. Slow down.
What?
Declan's laptop just came on.
If I can hack his web cam,
then maybe we can see what's going on.
Look. It's Jack. He's okay.
Oh, thank god.
Montauk, huh?
You might as well make yourself comfortable.
I'm turning this tub around.
No, wait. Something's wrong.
They're on the move.
Okay. Time of death is 3:05 p. m.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
That thing is practically as old as my--mother.
What are you doing here?
Charlotte. Hello, declan.
Hello.
I've come to invite you to the house.
It's the end of summer, and it seems we've barely seen you.
And tonight's our annual Labor Day party.
and things just would not be the same without you there.
Oh, she needs me for another publicity stunt.
Take him.
Okay.
You've wasted your time coming here.
Dad only needs the Grayson family by his side.
And I'm a Clarke now, something to be ashamed of.
Now if you recall, after our last publicity stunt,
I embraced your paternity.
And I can see that you've inherited
far more than David's surname.
I'm not ashamed of you, darling.
I'm very proud of you.
Well, I appreciate the sentiment.
But I'm sorry. I can't fake any more Grayson smiles.
Oh, Charlotte, please. If not for your father's benefit,
do it for that overheated infant.
It's clear that he needs a quiet, temperature-controlled space.
Declan can attest to how difficult it is
to find a repairman on Labor Day.
Yeah, she's right about that, and look, he needs rest,
and so do you.
And I gotta get back downstairs.
Fine, but only if Declan can join us after he finishes his shift.
Of course.
Yeah, thank you.
I'll get Carl's things.
The initiative draws you in with false hope.
By the time I got close enough, It was too late to save Colleen.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm not telling you this to scare you.
Okay? I've been where you are. I know how you feel.
And I'm confident that I can get you out of this
without endangering your father.
But first we need to be absolutely certain that he's still alive.
How do we do that?
Find Helen Crowley.
Start with a simple phone call.
I want to talk to Amanda.
Let me give you some free marital advice, J. P.
She's only gonna tell you more lies,
'cause that's what wives do -- they screw you over.
I wasn't talking to you.
I heard everything you said.
Is it true? You were just using me the whole time?
Jack, I can explain everything--
By the book. You've been had, man.
Yeah, apparently, I'm not the only one.
Meaning what?
She's been lying to you, too.
She brought a laptop on board last night.
Jack, don't--
I saw it. It's gotta be down there somewhere.
Is that true?
No.
Jack, I swear, you don't know what you're doing.
For the first time since I met you,
I know exactly what I'm doing.
Jack, please--
How could you do this to me, to our child? You're unbelievable.
I'm gonna let you two fight it out.
Out of my way.
It better be down here, Amanda.
Be honest for once in your life.
Is this marriage just a sham?
No.
You're just using me to get even with the Graysons?
Jack, when I first came to town,
I didn't expect to get together with you, but I did.
Then Carl came along, and you were amazing and...
I swear, I can explain everything.
About blackmailing Conrad Grayson,
threatening to kill a man while I was in prison?
What kind of person are you?
What kind of mother are you?
I did all of that for you...
For us and Carl.
Look, Jack. You've given my life meaning.
I love you, Jack. You have to believe that.
Save the rest for divorce court.
Mandy, get your ass down here.
You show me where that computer is now.
Let's go. Let's go!
It's under the mattress.
Come on!
It's in there.
Get it.
Camera's back online.
What's happening?
What the hell is this?
Now!
Let's go. Let's go.
Jack! Oh,god.
Oh, my god.
I think he shot Jack.
Come on, Jack. We have to hurry.
What are you doing?
Saving you.
Amanda...
I love you, Jack.
No. Amanda. No!
Where is he?
No!
Damn it!
Victoria, may I say, you are positively radiant
in your natural element?
You mean in the midst of a crisis or with blood on my hands?
No, I mean, in that dress
at one of your wickedly extravagant soirees.
Conrad, your gall never ceases to repulse me.
Overt flattery aside,
This extravagant soiree marks not only
the beginning of your farcical political career...
but the end of summer,
and therefore, our personal entanglement.
You and I had a deal.
Oh, no, no, no, my pet.
You made a proclamation that I never agreed to.
And less you've forgotten,
we can't possibly disentangle from one another now.
Because of last night?
Well, there is that.
And because voters worship family values,
and without you at my side, my ambitions will fail.
You know full well I could give a whit
about your personal ambitions.
Oh, you do. But you do give a whit about our son.
So let's press the flesh, shall we?
Any sign of Jack?
No. Not yet.
Keep looking. He's gotta be close.
Wait. N-Nate's turning the boat around.
He's probably going back for Jack. We have to get to him first.
Let's keep this our little secret, shall we?
My, uh, compliments on a lovely evening.
Oh, all credit to my wife, mister...
Call me Trask.
Trask.
I was hoping to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.
As a matter of fact, we do.
This is a private function,
and we specifically excluded the press.
I'm not a reporter, Mrs. Grayson.
Well, then... How can we help you?
You can start by telling me what happened to Helen Crowley.
After Ms. Crowley's driver dropped her at home,
her phone was switched off, and we lost contact.
How vexing for you.
And you.
Her driver confirmed that she was here before that,
meeting with you, Mrs. Grayson.
That's right.
I proposed a trade-- the evidence I had been holding
in exchange for her assurance that my son would not be harmed.
Helen Crowley doesn't negotiate.
You know, I'm wondering if her disappearance
is somehow related to the other thorn in our side.
Uh, David Clarke's daughter Amanda.
She's our perpetual tormentor.
What leverage does she have?
Well, the copies of the federal evidence
your people failed to destroy in last spring's plane crash.
It seems our people failed
at any number of intentions that evening.
Oh, wasn't I the lucky one?
And how do you suppose a girl like that
came to possess such incendiary material?
Well, your former henchman Gordon Murphy.
He was married to her mother, after all.
Anyway, Vctoria made Helen aware of the threat
as part of our detente,
and Helen assured her that Amanda Clarke
would pose no further problems.
And then?
And then I told her to get the hell out of my house.
Now, Mr. Trask,
I would encourage you to follow that advice.
Ems, I see him.
I see him.
He's not moving.
Let's go.
Tell me when!
Almost... Got it.
I got it.
It's good.
Okay. We gotta get him outta here.
Jack?
He's alive.
Nolan, there's no exit wound.
You have to get him to a hospital.
Nolan, I need to know that you can do this.
Ems, it's Jack.
I will do everything that I can,
but what are you gonna do?
I can't leave Amanda.
Ems!
Just go!
Nolan, go.
Come on. Come on.
Bitch.
Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in.
Last message received today
8:47 P.M.
Helen, it's Padma.
I've located Carrion, but the program is incomplete.
Nolan's the only one who can complete it,
and I'm the only one who can convince him to.
But I won't until you send me proof
that my father is still alive.
Helen's been compromised.
I'm gonna need to arrange delivery.
Amanda.
Amanda.
Emily.
You so much as blink, and you're dead.
We have to get Jack.
He's safe. Just get on the boat.
Emily!
Amanda, find his gun!
Who the hell are you?
You'll never know.
Bye-bye now.
We need to turn off the gas.
We gotta get outta here now!
Hold on a second. My necklace.
Amanda, no!
Come on.
No!
Emily, get down!
Amanda!
Amanda!
Amanda, can you hear me?!
Emily.
Amanda!
Okay?
Are you ready?
Helen?
Helen's no longer with us,
but your orders remain.
Deliver the program in its finished form,
or your father dies.
Before I do anything else,
I need proof that you haven't killed him already.
I believe you just signed for it.
Feel free to check the fingerprint.
No.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor
to introduce Conrad Grayson
and his family.
Thank you.
And it is our pleasure to stand here
with our closest friends and supporters
on this Labor Day.
With the blessings and support of my wife and children,
I have decided to announce
that I will humbly be seeking the opportunity
to serve as your next governor.
Thank you.
Tell me Jack's gonna be okay.
We'll know as soon as Nolan comes back with the boat.
Just try to be still. Save your energy.
Damn it.
Jack...
And my baby...
I need to know that you'll take care of them.
Don't you talk like that.
Oh, god.
Give me your word.
I promise.
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
You've given me the one thing that I thought I'd never have...
A real family.
Here.
I'll be back for this.
And I'll be back for you, too.
I promise.
Amanda, wait.
We're sisters, right?
Right.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Oh, god, no.
Amanda.
Oh, god.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
Oh, god.
It's finally cooling off.
Mercifully.
I look forward to the change of season.
Sweetheart, are you all right?
What kind of question is that?
Of course he is.
We all are, my dear, thanks to you.
How are we gonna live with this?
Like we always do.
We go about our lives as if nothing ever happened.
And what about Amanda Clarke?
Poor girl.
She chose the wrong enemy.
Sacrifice demands the surrender of things
we cherish above all else.
Only out of the agony of those losses
can a new resolution be born...
An undying devotion to a cause greater than one's self...
Emily!
Emily!
And a moral duty to see a journey through...
To its absolute completion.
