may i ?
oh . uh , no , sorry .
i &apos;m , uh , saving them .
this isn &apos;t a game , mr. stack .
i didn &apos;t say it was .
you &apos;re treating it like it is .
i &apos;m treating it with all the respect it deserves .
mr. stack ?
mr. dylan stack ?
yes . present .
hi , i &apos;m alicia florrick .
we spoke on the phone .
yes . nice to meet you .
this is a mistake , mr. stack .
you walk through that door , we can &apos;t help you .
well , what if i walk through that door ?
what was that about ?
posturing .
before we begin , mr. stack ,
i just want to warn you
that we are a full @-@ service firm .
we don &apos;t really take walk @-@ ins .
oh , well , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not technically a walk @-@ in .
i called you .
yes , ten minutes ago , saying you were walking in .
sorry . i don &apos;t like reservations .
i can pay .
for ... ?
keeping me out of jail .
are you in danger of going to jail ?
yes . the two men out there are federal agents from the treasury .
they &apos;ve been following me for the last two days .
why ?
i won &apos;t reveal the name of my client .
okay .
oh , no , i @-@ i mean ...
that &apos;s why they &apos;re following me .
hello .
if you &apos;re agents from the u.s. treasury
and i ask to see your badges ,
you have to show me them , correct ?
may i see your badges , gentlemen ?
actually , could you hold them higher ?
i practice digital information law in new york .
the u.s. treasury wants to arrest one of my clients ,
a client who asked that i maintain his anonymity .
this is a subpoena to submit to questioning ,
or be imprisoned for 18 months .
why have you come to us ?
to you , actually .
the rumor is you &apos;ve had your own dealings with the treasury .
dealings in which you came out the victor .
well , i think that &apos;s a bit of an exaggeration .
and as i was saying , we do have a pretty stable client ...
i don &apos;t like credit cards or checks .
that &apos;s a lot of money .
it is .
is it counterfeit ?
no , why ?
well , the involvement of the u.s. treasury
would suggest some reason for ... concern .
no . they &apos;re after my client for ... something else .
and what is that ?
he invented a new currency .
really ?
how did he do that ?
he invented bitcoin .
it &apos;s a ... digital currency .
it &apos;s traded and spent online .
yes . i &apos;ve read about it .
well , according to the fbi ,
it is a violation of federal law for individuals
to create private coin or currency systems .
i think the treasury feels ... threatened .
bitcoin ?
yes . it &apos;s an online currency .
but he &apos;s not going to pay us in bitcoin , is he ?
no , he &apos;s got cash . lots of it , in fact .
i don &apos;t know , diane . it &apos;s the u.s. government .
we swore off these charge- of @-@ the @-@ light @-@ brigade suits .
we swore off the ones based on idealism .
this one has cash . and i know how that sounds .
okay .
but let &apos;s not stick our necks out too far .
when we poke the bear ?
i &apos;m tired . i mix metaphors when i &apos;m tired .
how &apos;s it going ?
well , she sure is different .
you can always get kurt leventhal .
i have his number right here .
no . i rolled the dice .
hey , what time are they ...
oh . here they are . hello .
here i go .
you have the right to remain silent .
this way .
you visit me in prison ?
every friday .
i &apos;m putting on a good face .
i &apos;m actually kind of terrified .
that makes sense .
i thought you were gonna say something comforting ,
like , &quot; don &apos;t be . &quot;
sorry .
well , i guess the truth is comforting , too .
sorry to keep you waiting , mr. stack .
we have agreed to take your case .
oh . that &apos;s great . thank you .
but we can &apos;t receive the cash .
we need a cashier &apos;s check .
yep .
only in america is greater abstraction more desirable .
i am so sorry .
they found asbestos in my office .
this is fine , thank you .
mr. gardner , this is a proffer session .
并得到不会遭到控诉的保证
it &apos;s completely ...
would you like something to drink ?
no , thank you .
it &apos;s completely off the record .
if you give me ...
how about you two ?
oh , i &apos;m fine .
no , thank you .
well , do you mind if i have something ?
i didn &apos;t have breakfast .
oh , and , um ... we have blankets ,
you know , if anybody &apos;s cold .
hi .
just one morning shake , please .
thanks .
sorry . go ahead .
if you supply us with truthful information
as to your knowledge about judicial criminal conduct ,
we &apos;ll close this investigation against you .
no grand jury .
does that make sense ?
it does .
the ... the name of your bookie was ...
... was jonathan meade , is that correct ?
jonathan meade was the name of a friend of mine
who i invited to one of my wednesday night basketball games .
but he acted as a bookie ?
he acted in a lot of capacities .
at one point , he was even an actor .
really ? in what ?
i ... i don &apos;t know ,
but i think it was a low @-@ budget movie .
a horror movie ?
and you witnessed
several judges placing bets with jonathan meade ?
could you be more specific ?
regarding ?
which three judges ?
excuse me , ms. tascioni ,
this is mr. gardner &apos;s proffer , not ours .
oh , yes , i know , but
mr. gardner needs to know what you &apos;re after
in order to help you .
there were a lot of judges at this basketball game over the years ,
and how many of them talked to your actor friend ?
quite a few .
you see ?
how can we help you if you won &apos;t give us any direction on how to help you ?
judge winter , judge dunaway , and judge parks .
okay , now it &apos;s your turn , mr. gardner .
did you see mr. meade placing any bets
or otherwise conferring with these three judges ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i wish i could remember .
that was a shame .
she played you .
yes , thank you , cary .
this investigator that you &apos;re cultivating at lockhart / gardner ?
kalinda ?
mm @-@ hmm .
it &apos;s time to stop cultivating , and start planting .
okay .
we need to have a conversation about vulnerabilities .
here &apos;s the difficulty :
i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m vulnerable .
well , i &apos;d start looking ,
because ... oh , look , there &apos;s my earring !
dollar bills can be lost , stolen , burned .
bitcoin is here forever , on the internet .
while dollar bills are traded through a bank ,
bitcoin is traded peer @-@ to @-@ peer . yay !
see , mom ? pretty colors .
fun , right ?
thanks , zach .
so ...
you don &apos;t buy bitcoin .
no , you can .
there are currency traders online .
yeah , one bitcoin &apos;s worth three dollars .
it used to be $ 33 . people were hoarding .
but that &apos;s not how it gets into circulation . you mine it .
like gold . the guy who invented it created this program
that releases blocks of bitcoin over time .
see ?
that means running software on your computer
that works to solve complicated mathematical problems .
you receive a bitcoin when your computer succeeds .
the more computer power you have ,
the more mining you can do .
once you have bitcoins ...
so you &apos;re representing the inventor , mrs. florrick .
that &apos;s really cool .
just his lawyer , nisa .
bit less cool .
it &apos;s like this big mystery .
the guy who invented bitcoin .
nobody knows who he is .
he &apos;s supposed to be this genius cryptographer ,
because no one &apos;s been able to break the bitcoin code yet .
yeah , my father thinks he &apos;s a japanese programmer .
i heard irish .
okay . well .
thanks for your help .
this stuff makes me feel so ... dated .
i have to go .
i love you .
love you , too .
good morning , your honor .
good morning , mr. higgs .
you &apos;re representing the u.s. treasury today , correct ?
yes , your honor .
good . &apos; cause i have some complaints about
my susan b. anthony silver dollars .
that- that was before my time .
no , seriously . what were they thinking ?
they feel like quarters .
well , again , i wasn &apos;t here ,
but i can ask around .
oh , please . please do .
ah . mrs. florrick . hello .
good morning , your honor .
so , uh ... money-- that &apos;s why we &apos;re here today ?
oh , yes , your honor .
mrs. florrick &apos;s client
represents a criminal , mr. bitcoin .
excuse me .
mr. bitcoin ?
yes . that &apos;s what we &apos;ve come to designate
the mysterious creator of this new internet currency .
do you guys at treasury get a lot of dates ?
yes , we do . um ... thank you for asking .
and why is this so important ?
we believe this unregulated currency is being used
in a digital black market ,
guaranteeing anonymity to money launderers , drug dealers ,
and child pornographers . and mr. bitcoin
is attempting to guarantee his own anonymity
through the smokescreen of attorney @-@ client privilege .
i don &apos;t think i would call attorney @-@ client privilege
a smokescreen , your honor .
this privilege protects communications between
a lawyer and his client ,
not the client &apos;s identity .
unless his identity is the subject
of these communications .
with one exception .
the &quot; crime fraud exception , &quot; which requires that
mr. stack reveal mr. bitcoin
if he &apos;s in the process of committing a crime .
which has not been established .
you know , folks ,
i always wait in court patiently
for these little conundrums .
that is why god made me a judge .
so that i could decide on motions exactly like this .
so ... eeny , meeny , miny , moe .
that &apos;s a joke , folks .
government &apos;s motion is denied .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
now i have to go meet with some occupy wall streeters .
new clients ?
yes , but ...
these don &apos;t pay as well .
hello again .
you &apos;re under arrest , mr. stack .
you heard the judge &apos;s ruling .
yes , that attorney @-@ client privilege applies .
i don &apos;t agree , but i respect the law .
then we &apos;re done .
no , we &apos;re not .
i &apos;m arresting mr. stack for being mr. bitcoin .
oh , come on !
i am coming on .
mr. stack presents himself as a lawyer
representing the mysterious mr. bitcoin ,
but we &apos;ve come to realize he is mr. bitcoin ,
and the penalty for creating a currency is 10 to 30 years .
you &apos;re under arrest , mr. stack .
your honor , mr. higgs does not believe
that my client is mr. bitcoin .
he is using this arrest to apply pressure
in counteraction to your ruling .
yes , mr. higgs ,
the timing of the arrest does seem strangely coincidental .
bitcoin has incorporated , your honor .
here are the incorporation papers .
as you can see ,
the only signature evident is that of mr. stack .
because he &apos;s bitcoin &apos;s lawyer , not its creator .
bitcoin has subcontractors :
computer entrepreneurs who supply animation or random coding .
as you can see from these affidavits ,
their only contact was with mr. stack .
because mr. bitcoin wanted to remain anonymous .
really , mrs. florrick ,
must we all use &quot; mr. bitcoin &quot; now ?
occam &apos;s razor , your honor .
the person signing the checks ,
incorporating and becoming
the public face of a company is the company .
your honor , those documents don &apos;t prove anything .
but they are evocative .
and i must say , i am a sucker for occam &apos;s razor .
so i will grant mr. stack bail
and , uh , hear arguments tomorrow .
good to see you again .
always a pleasure .
the difficulty here is proving a negative .
how do we prove dylan isn &apos;t his client
if we can &apos;t prove someone else is his client ?
does he know you &apos;re in trouble , dylan , your client ?
can he help us ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t say anything
without breaking attorney @-@ client privilege .
okay , so hit the incorporation papers--
that &apos;s not proof of ownership .
no , play offense , not defense .
how ?
bitcoin isn &apos;t a currency .
there &apos;s no crime if bitcoin is a commodity--
just something to be traded like a bushel of fruit .
mr. gardner taps his inner rebel .
good , we have our strategy in court .
and outside court ?
was there anything said by your client
that would prevent us from hunting him down independently ?
i cannot help you
without breaking attorney @-@ client privilege .
but we can do it on our own ?
again , i cannot help you .
well , the inventor has left a few fingerprints .
he wrote a manifesto when bitcoin came out .
i could use linguistic analysis to run him down .
good . and look for contact points with stack .
when did they meet ?
where ?
you might try decode @-@ a @-@ con.
what , it &apos;s not on your social calendar ?
stack is here for decode @-@ a @-@ con , the conference of cryptographers .
good . maybe they were meeting there .
okay , i &apos;m on it .
uh , one thing we might consider .
what ?
it could be him .
i am vulnerable .
it &apos;s innocent , but it looks bad .
okay .
are you sure you want to tell me ?
subpoenas could go out .
when i stopped gambling , this friend--
my bookie-- jonathan meade ,
he forgave my debt .
how much ?
$ 8,000 .
it &apos;s not much , but it could look like
a payoff for setting him up with these judges .
but it wasn &apos;t ?
i didn &apos;t take it that way .
this guy was a friend .
my guess is wendy is trying to tie it to a case we won .
they &apos;re looking at three judges :
winter , dunaway , parks .
could you look at our cases before them ?
i want to anticipate which one they &apos;ll hit .
sure .
how are you holding up ?
i don &apos;t want to go to jail .
up until this week , i never thought i would .
it &apos;s making you more human .
that &apos;s not much of a trade @-@ off .
jim cramer . i am a former hedge fund manager ,
author and current host of mad money .
your honor , we take this case very seriously .
obviously , mrs. florrick does not .
is there an objection in there somewhere , mr. higgs ?
we object to the defense questioning this tv personality
as an expert in currency .
hmm , well , let me think about that .
overruled .
mr. cramer , do you consider bitcoin a currency ?
no , i don &apos;t .
it has none of the characteristics associated with coinage and currency .
in what way ?
there &apos;s no central bank to regulate it ,
it &apos;s digital and functions completely peer @-@ to @-@ peer .
thank you , mr. cramer .
you &apos;re welcome , ma &apos;am .
mr. cramer , are you the tv personality
who regularly shouts and badgers on mad money ?
well , i think &quot; badger &quot; is debatable ,
but , yes , i have a very , dare i say ,
flamboyant personality on my tv program .
and you use various beeps and honking sounds on your program ,
and sometimes clench a knife between your teeth ?
i would call it a scimitar more than a knife .
and , yes , i do employ beeps .
why aren &apos;t you objecting ?
because the judge is .
so why on earth should this court take you seriously ?
for the reason you would any man : the solidity of my arguments .
so you would ask this court to ignore the ass you make of yourself on tv ?
excuse me , mr. higgs .
may i ask you please to be more cordial in your questioning ?
thank you .
my apologies , mr. cramer .
i &apos;m a great fan of your show , by the way .
thank you . no apologies .
was it montaigne who said ,
&quot; how many valiant men can survive their own reputation &quot; ?
no further questions .
so , hieroglyphics were the first cryptograms .
the egyptians , like companies and governments today ,
strove to protect their sensitive information ...
are you familiar with the 2009 abstract that speaks directly to this issue ?
of course i &apos;m familiar with the study ,
but the methodology is completely flawed .
is leakage inevitable ?
leakage is never inevitable .
c + + allows for some restrictions
based on the complexity of the leakage .
okay ?
now , if you gentlemen will excuse me ,
i will be right back .
sorry . this is the only place i can get some peace and quiet .
oh , no problem .
it &apos;s quite a scene , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , just wait till the crypto @-@ bash .
there &apos;s nothing like a bunch of drunk cryptographers .
so you &apos;re mr. bitcoin ?
no .
elaine middleton , mit .
you ?
kalinda sharma .
st. mary &apos;s high .
i did a linguistic match on the bitcoin manifesto ,
and guess what popped up ?
a patent application by one of the ten hottest geek women .
oh , god .
that &apos;ll be on my tombstone .
no nobel , no mhv , just third @-@ hottest geek woman .
everybody &apos;s looking for mr. bitcoin ,
when in fact , they don &apos;t realize it &apos;s mrs. bitcoin .
you have a linguistic tic , ms. middleton .
&quot; theoretically established combinatorial properties . &quot;
it &apos;s an odd little phrase that you &apos;ve used exactly twice .
once in a patent application and once in the manifesto .
actually , you &apos;ll find that odd phrasing used three times .
once by me , once in the manifesto ,
and once by a chinese econophysicist
from nankai university who goes by the code name : newmint91 .
really ?
and why does newmint91 use that phrasing ?
he has a crush on me .
and he steals things .
&quot; he &quot; ?
so , you &apos;ve met him ?
yeah , actually , just today
for the first time at the conference .
bao shuwei .
thanks .
hello there .
hello there , yourself .
what are you doing ?
attending decode @-@ a @-@ con.
what about you ?
i am staring at a document you might be interested in .
i thought we could get together and talk .
sure . whenever you want .
how &apos;s tomorrow ?
yeah , tomorrow &apos;s good .
my name is mitchell tambor .
and i stayed at the crestview priority inn
on the night of november 18 , 2011 .
thank you , mr. tambor .
this room at the crestview priority inn ,
tell us about it .
well , uh , it was nice .
mr. higgs , as much as i cherish
all this time we spend together ,
is there some driving point you want to make ?
yes , your honor .
uh ... sorry .
uh , mr. tambor , how did you purchase this room ?
with bitcoin .
and how much bitcoin did one night set you back ?
well , the exchange rate at the time was approximately
$ 25 for one bitcoin , so i spent 4.32 bitcoin .
and did you purchase other goods with this bitcoin ?
an in @-@ room movie , yes .
good . and what movie was that ?
that &apos;s okay .
uh , any other incidentals ?
uh , a snickers bar and some peanuts from the minibar .
and you paid for all this with bitcoin that you mined ?
you used it as money ?
as currency ?
yes .
no further questions .
no , sir , we just need a rebuttal witness .
you &apos;re not in trouble .
get home safe , okay ?
i will .
all right , i &apos;ll call you later .
no , i &apos;ll hold .
bye .
so , you and nisa are getting close .
i guess so .
this was her fourth night over here .
i thought you liked nisa .
i do .
but , um , are you getting too serious ?
mom , we go to different schools now .
we don &apos;t see each other at school ,
so we see each other here .
i know , but maybe you should slow it down a little .
why ?
because ... you &apos;re young .
because she &apos;s young .
you &apos;ll meet a lot of people . she will , too .
did i do something wrong ?
no , no , it &apos;s just ...
she &apos;s over here a lot .
is this &apos; cause she &apos;s black ?
oh , my god , no .
zach !
no , you don &apos;t believe that .
i don &apos;t know what to believe , mom .
you don &apos;t want her over here .
okay , wait a minute , stop .
you know it &apos;s not that , so don &apos;t try to pretend .
i heard you two saying &quot; i love you . &quot;
i &apos;m just worried that it &apos;s moving too fast , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;ll ask her over here less .
hello ? uh , yes . hello , sir .
great .
uh , can you meet us at court ?
alex krakowski .
i &apos;m the manager of the crestview priority inn .
and you rented mr. tambor the room in question ?
that &apos;s correct .
this hotel room is taking on legendary status , isn &apos;t it ?
and you accepted his bitcoin ?
yeah . it &apos;s a promotion , so yeah .
and you would also have accepted
his frequent travel miles in trade for the room ?
yeah .
we have a promotion going .
priority inn frequent travel miles .
but you don &apos;t consider frequent travel miles cash ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , you have a cash register
with a drawer for cash .
oh , yeah , no .
we don &apos;t have a drawer for bitcoin or frequent travel miles .
so it &apos;s more like a trade ?
trading frequent travel miles for the room ?
uh , yeah .
in other words ,
it &apos;s a commodity , not a currency ?
yeah . and we &apos;re not gonna do it much more with bitcoin .
i thought it would be cool , but it &apos;s a bit of a hassle .
thank you . no further questions .
good morning , mr. krakowski .
if you wanted to purchase a book on amazon ,
could you do it using the frequent travel miles
you accept at your hotel ?
could i do it ? no , i don &apos;t think so .
because they &apos;re non @-@ transferrable ?
yeah , that &apos;s right . it says right on it .
but you could buy a book on amazon
with the cash from your cash drawer ?
well , no . you &apos;d have to do it with a credit card or something .
but you could also buy the book with bitcoin , could you not ?
yeah , i think that &apos;s right .
because bitcoin is transferrable ,
and therefore a currency ?
okay , okay , i get it .
you know , i &apos;d love to hear more about this saga
of the priority inn in crestview ,
but i &apos;m ready to rule .
bitcoin is a currency . there .
your honor , mr. higgs still hasn &apos;t proved
my client created bitcoin .
we &apos;ll be ready with witnesses tomorrow , your honor .
good . see the two of you tomorrow morning .
i need help on will gardner .
i &apos;m getting pressure ,
and i &apos;ve been asked to give you pressure .
and that &apos;s what that &apos;s about ?
yes .
you have a choice to make .
people always say &quot; choice &quot; when i think they mean &quot; ultimatum . &quot;
this was slipped to us last week .
it &apos;s highly actionable .
unless ?
unless you get me something on will gardner .
we need to find which case makes him most vulnerable .
i like will .
i go back and forth on you .
then don &apos;t do it for me .
that is alicia florrick &apos;s signature
on what we believe is a forged document
recently sent to us by an opposing attorney
in a divorce case against your firm .
that &apos;s a felony .
forging a document and perjury ,
we prove this , alicia gets disbarred .
but we don &apos;t want her .
we want will gardner .
i &apos;m on your side , kalinda .
newmint91 ?
who are you ?
kalinda sharma .
your friend , elaine , suggested we meet .
where is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s bao , right ?
yeah .
don &apos;t you ever just want to let the secret out ?
scream at the top of your lungs , &quot; i did it &quot; ?
did what ?
invented bitcoin .
okay . oh , god ,
she &apos;s getting back at me , isn &apos;t she ?
so she sent you ?
getting back at you for what ?
i said i would leave her alone .
i found out she invented bitcoin ,
and she threatened me , so i said i would drop it .
now she sends you .
no , no , she didn &apos;t send me .
i &apos;m not mr. bitcoin .
she is .
anyway , you should check out the new embedding .
that isn &apos;t me .
what isn &apos;t you ?
the newest block of bitcoin
has a statement embedded in the code .
a statement ?
when did that happen ?
last night .
see ?
what does it say ?
&quot; stack is innocent . &quot;
your honor , the time code of the embedding
on this new block of bitcoins--
embedding that only could be put there by bitcoin &apos;s inventor--
was at exactly the same moment
mr. stack was in court yesterday .
which means nothing , your honor .
it &apos;s the easiest thing in the world
to arrange for a delayed embedding .
and in fact , if you were trying to establish an alibi ,
wouldn &apos;t you delay the embedding
for exactly the moment you were in court ?
or if you were trying to set mr. stack up ,
wouldn &apos;t you do the same ?
so we &apos;re back to zero .
what a familiar place .
not exactly , your honor .
yes , i was one of the subcontractors hired
to do computation work .
i didn &apos;t know it was bitcoin at the time .
and all your dealings were with ... ?
mr. stack there , yes . hi .
she &apos;s gonna set me up .
why ?
jealousy .
cryptographer jealousy .
the ugliest kind .
do you have an opinion as to
whether mr. stack had the technological capacity
to be mr. bitcoin ?
objection .
the witness is not qualified to answer .
well , she seems qualified enough to me .
overruled .
yes .
mr. stack definitely is qualified to be mr. bitcoin .
my dad just keeps this apartment
for when he &apos;s working late in court .
and you &apos;re sure it &apos;s all right to work here ?
yeah , he won &apos;t mind .
it &apos;s better than home .
well , look who &apos;s here .
zach .
hi , grandma . how &apos;s it going ?
and , nisa , right ?
yes . how are you , mrs. florrick ?
very well , thank you .
i thought you two were in different schools now .
we are . we &apos;re just working on some homework together .
we &apos;re gonna use dad &apos;s study .
and how is public school , nisa ?
it &apos;s good , ma &apos;am .
we all miss zach there .
well , perhaps he can return sometimes and say hello .
we hope so .
bye , ma &apos;am .
we &apos;re gonna go listen to some music ,
so it might get a bit loud .
zach ,
i &apos;m surprised you two are still friends .
i thought you were seeing eli gold &apos;s daughter .
what ? no .
i mean , she came over to the apartment once .
she &apos;s nice , but she &apos;s in college .
i see .
but she &apos;s very young , zach .
marissa ?
no , nisa .
she &apos;s only a year younger than me .
yes , but you have such different experiences now
that you &apos;re in capstone .
and you don &apos;t want to always be driving across town .
it &apos;s not that far .
i just don &apos;t want you to get too serious .
maybe you should slow it down a bit .
you &apos;ll meet a lot of different people .
she will , too .
what ?
did i say something ?
no , that &apos;s just what my mom said earlier .
really ?
well , your mother is probably right .
she just testified against our client in court .
yeah , she &apos;s trying to deflect attention from herself .
can &apos;t you help trace the source of her embedding ?
mmm @-@ mm . she would have covered her tracks .
yeah , but if this recent embedding was done remotely ,
can &apos;t you trace the ip address ?
i probably can .
it won &apos;t matter .
she &apos;ll have moved on from there .
yeah , but it will help me get closer to her .
what , do you know it ?
it &apos;s our ip address .
ours ?
lockhart / gardner ?
it was embedded from here ?
yeah .
so we think it &apos;s him , and not this woman who testified ?
yeah .
well , he &apos;s still our client . we need to represent him .
yeah , but i &apos;m gonna stop looking for mr. bitcoin .
oh , i agree .
um , so you &apos;re helping will on his issue ?
yeah .
i know will tries to stay brave about these things ,
but i don &apos;t want to be behind the curve .
you want to know when to cut your losses ?
no . i want to know when to help .
okay .
i &apos;ll keep you in the loop .
thank you .
$ 8,000 ?
that &apos;s how much this actor paid you ?
well , no , he excused my debt for that amount .
okay . what else ?
well , we think she &apos;ll try to go after a case , too .
mmm , i think you &apos;re right .
so we reviewed all of our cases with those three judges .
and we &apos;re in good shape on almost all of them .
who does the design in here ?
it &apos;s very attractive .
i don &apos;t know . i can find out .
that would be great .
the worst is the mcdermott case .
product tampering .
it resulted in an $ 8 @-@ million judgment in our favor .
the evidence wasn &apos;t with us , but it went our way anyway .
why is that ?
sometimes the ball just bounces funny .
i like that .
so , was it a jury trial ?
no , bench .
which judge ?
parks .
okay , i &apos;m gonna ask this
in the most friendly and objective way possible ,
and just understand , this is not a prod to do anything ,
um , but is there anything in that file there
any notes or receipts or nasty little memos
that could make you look bad ?
yeah . it could make will look bad .
okay .
good to know . i &apos;m gonna go now .
what do you want me to do ?
i can &apos;t ask you to do anything .
i know .
yeah ?
yeah , it &apos;s bao .
you told me to stay in touch .
yeah . bao i &apos;m a little bit busy right now .
i did a deeper analysis of the ip address ,
where the recent embedding came from ?
yeah ?
okay , i had to use a large data set because it was stored on
an untrusted server , and if i amortized the verifiable computation ...
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s real interesting , boa , but no .
the thing is , there was
no protection on the source computer .
there wasn &apos;t ?
no , so i could trace it to the computer
where the embedding was done .
great . what was it ?
it &apos;s your computer .
you did not embed the &quot; stack is innocent &quot; code
on the new bitcoins , ms. sharma ?
i &apos;ll be answering for her .
no .
and yet we traced the embedding to your computer .
ms. sharma has nothing to do with it .
and i would like to bring the treasury &apos;s attention
to a common computer hacking practice called ghosting ,
in which the hacker only needs access to a parasite computer
to get it to do his or her will .
in other words ,
mr. stack had access to ms. sharma &apos;s computer .
no . to deny that ms. sharma did it
is not to say that mr. stack did .
and yet , as judge sobel might say , it is evocative .
ms. sharma has been independently searching for mr. bitcoin ,
and in the process , she has been in close proximity
to several key bitcoin suspects .
any one of those could have ghosted her computer .
and would ms. sharma like to share those names ?
no .
but thank you .
this is one thing you might want to consider .
you &apos;re representing a client who is willing to set you up for a federal crime .
that , to me , is not a healthy attorney @-@ client relationship .
do you know who did it ?
i have a suspicion .
that leaves us with an lr @-@ zk interactive proof system
construction based on standard general assumptions .
and we &apos;ll have to leave it at that ,
because i have someone here who wants to question me .
yep . someone ghosted your laptop a few days ago .
here &apos;s the after effect .
good . can you tell who did it ?
no , but i can tell you where it was done .
would you like that ?
i would .
this isn &apos;t one of those columbo @-@ like things
where you keep me doing things for you , hoping i &apos;ll slip up ?
because i &apos;d rather just confess .
i would rather that , too .
tell me what i should be confessing to .
ghosting my computer . embedding the bitcoin remotely .
here &apos;s something you should find interesting .
whoever ghosted your computer wanted to be found out .
really ?
it &apos;s easy to cover your tracks when you ghost .
they didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s like they &apos;re taunting you .
who ?
i don &apos;t know .
but whoever did it recently did a search of the ip addresses you accessed .
you know who it is ?
i know who it is .
so we &apos;re back to proving stack is innocent ?
maybe there &apos;s another way of proving it .
what ?
treasury doesn &apos;t really believe
that our client is mr. bitcoin , do they ?
they &apos;re just using stack to get to him .
yes .
so prove that .
prove higgs is still looking .
that he doesn &apos;t think stack is the one .
right .
good . i &apos;m on it .
see ? no nisa .
i see .
everything okay with you two ?
mom , you said that we should be seeing less of each other .
no . i said maybe you were moving too fast .
yeah , that &apos;s what grandma said .
she did ?
she said that we should slow down &apos; cause we &apos;re too different .
that &apos;s what she said ?
she said that it wasn &apos;t a matter of race . just that ...
i &apos;m in private school and nisa &apos;s in public school .
hey , nisa .
yeah , come on over .
no , my mom says it &apos;s fine .
bao .
hey .
so you did it .
did what ?
come on , bao .
you &apos;re the one who traced my ip addresses .
you ghosted my computer ,
and you wanted me to find you .
no .
if people knew you created bitcoin ,
you &apos;d get a lot of attention .
people would talk to you .
in fact , you would be the hero of the occupy wall street crowd .
have you seen the occupy wall street women ?
they &apos;re beautiful .
are those guys with you ?
no .
i have to go .
wait , bao .
talk to me .
come on .
not ... not here . not with them around .
okay . then ... let me get rid of them .
m @-@ my room .
upstairs-- 2545 .
do you want something ?
actually , it &apos;s what mr. higgs wants .
tell him to come on down , and i will give him mr. bitcoin .
no .
bye .
you know , i &apos;m really good at losing people , so after i lose you two ,
call mr. higgs and tell him to meet me
on the 25th floor of this hotel .
hello .
hi . you didn &apos;t need to dress up .
what do you need ?
mr. bitcoin is through that door .
bao shuwei .
an econophysicist .
yeah ?
from nankai university .
what &apos;s an econophysicist ?
uh , i have no idea , but they &apos;re very impressed with themselves .
is @-@ is it all right if a , uh ... treasury official accompanies us ?
sure .
i have a key .
very resourceful of you . great .
looks like your friend checked out .
it &apos;s for you . do you mind ?
sure .
&quot; dear kalinda , i wish i could stay and talk ,
but i don &apos;t like attention , and creating bitcoin
would probably bring me the wrong kind .
but now i have a new obsession .
i love you . &quot;
i have one more witness , your honor .
goody , goody . i can &apos;t wait , mrs. florrick .
kalinda sharma .
and mr. higgs followed you into the hotel room ?
yes .
and he stated that he was looking
for the real inventor of bitcoin ?
objection , your honor .
no , mr. higgs . you may answer .
mr. higgs stated that he believed
i was on the right track to finding mr. bitcoin .
and what was that right track ?
bao shuwei ,
an econophysicist from nankai university .
objection . this is all hearsay , your honor .
no . no .
uh , i recorded it .
by accident .
i just got a new phone ,
and i didn &apos;t know how to turn it off .
thank you .
feeling less terrified ?
oh , much less .
here &apos;s your cashier &apos;s check .
it only took 20 minutes standing in line at a bank
to change dollar bills into another piece of paper .
thank you .
i went on line and i bought one bitcoin last night .
really ? it &apos;s the future .
i don &apos;t know . it didn &apos;t feel real .
well , real &apos;s gonna change . just watch .
thank you .
for what ?
testifing .
i just followed the path you set .
the path i set ?
yeah .
there is no mr. bitcoin .
there &apos;s three .
really ?
yeah .
it &apos;s not one person ; it &apos;s three .
i looked up the decode @-@ a @-@ con logs for the last three years .
you met each other in 2009,
and that &apos;s where you came up with the idea .
elaine wrote the manifesto ,
and bao wrote the code .
and you got all that from ... what , a log ?
oh , from a log and a lot of pointed fingers .
you were hoping to lose the treasury in a round @-@ robin .
i think you are overestimating my intelligence .
no . i don &apos;t think i am .
well , then , thank you .
i &apos;m honored .
there you are .
what do you have ?
what &apos;s this ?
you &apos;ll see .
