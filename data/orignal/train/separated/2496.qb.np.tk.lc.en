massive haul this year .
to candy !
fee @-@ fi @-@ fo @-@ fum , give me all your candy and gum !
who are you and why do you want our candy ?
your mother is the switch witch--
a sort of tooth fairy dealie .
i take your sugary sweets and i give you healthy items .
plain brown toothbrushes , unflavored dental floss
and fun @-@ sized mouthwashes--
tsa approved .
this is exactly why kids need a union .
now remember , homie , that candy goes to ...
our fighting men and women overseas .
it &apos;s our way of letting them know we &apos;re having fun back here .
no sneaking off and eating that candy yourself .
marge , you know i &apos;d never do that .
i &apos;m too scared of the evil switch witch .
the switch witch is me .
you know , on some level , i &apos;ve always known .
i &apos;ve got candy , skip to my lou
my insulin will spike , that &apos;s what it &apos;s gonna do
i &apos;m gonna buy me some diabetic shoes
skip to my lou my ...
what the ... ? !
hello , 911 ?
i need a helicopter rescue and some cold milk .
copy that , sir .
we &apos;ll be there in 20 minutes .
what ? ! i can &apos;t wait that long for candy !
the only sane thing to do is chew off my arm .
i &apos;m not gonna swallow , &apos; cause i want to save room for candy .
i &apos;m really getting the hang of this .
all worth it for candy .
no ... !

this is so horrible .
i can &apos;t speak !
how did this happen ?
last thing i remember ,
i was decorating the house for halloween .
ah , halloween .
the one time of year when the squalor of our home
works to our advantage .
where &apos;s that spider ? ah .
squeeze , squeeze !
squeeze , squeeze !
a real spider would get so mad if i did this .
i wonder if this thing has batteries .
it &apos;s alive ? !
hmm . well , at least i still look good .
okay , handsome , that &apos;s enough primping .
just because you &apos;ve had a little setback
doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t look your best .
oh , marge .
this is the purest love
there patient , supportive ...
ooh , cleavage .
dad , i &apos;m going to entertain you
with the help of the brothers karamazov .
&quot; alexey fyodorovitch karamazov was the third son
of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov ,
&quot; a landowner well known in our district in his own day ,
and still remembered among us ... &quot;
oh , my god .
she &apos;s still on the first sentence !
must make her stop .
how to express my ...
dad ! ew .
anyway , continuing .
&quot; for the present , i will only say
that this &apos; landowner &apos; -- for so we ... &quot;
ew ! dad !
wait a minute .
can you pass gas at will ?
fart once for no , twice for yes .
oh , my god !
do you realize what this means ?
well , it means that you can communicate .
exactly .
i &apos;ll recite the alphabet , and you tell me when to stop .
a , b , c , d ...
okay , first letter ,
d.
next letter .
a , b , c , d , e ...
&quot; d , e. &quot;
amazing !
oh , but before we continue .
okay .
a ...
&quot; d , e , a. &quot;
&quot; dearest marge , though my body
cannot move , my heart still beats
and my brain still brains .
i miss holding you in my arms
more than my butt can say .
perhaps someday there will be a cure .
although if it requires
months of difficult physical therapy , i &apos;ll pass .
you are the shining light
that gets me through my darkest hours .
for further communication , i will require more beans .
i love you . &quot;
oh , homie .
don &apos;t say a word .
i guess my life isn &apos;t so bad .
with the help of my loving family ,
i even published my first book .
由侯默 · 辛普森臆想完成
and i &apos;ve finally reached a state of serenity and ...
another spider !
what &apos;s this bite gonna do ?
my wrists are tingling .
i feel new powers surging within me !
he &apos;s got the proportionate strength
of a paralyzed spider !
forget paying for my kid &apos;s operation-- i &apos;m out of here !
they say no two ass @-@ webs are the same .
beautiful in its way .
want to go home and celebrate ?
i wish i could move like him .
springfield , my hometown .
pretty little place .
although , even the garden of eden
could use a nice cleansing rain now and then .
my money &apos;s on the kid .
hey , whiskers .
want to party ?
spend less time on your back and more time on your knees .
have i lost my back @-@ alley beauty ?
well , those who can &apos;t do , teach .
no more distractions .

违者罚款一万美元
all these years , i thought murder was a sin .
then i got new instructions from the good lord himself
in his favorite language-- english .
slay montgomery burns
and pee in his ashes !
are you sure , lord ?
if you &apos;re having trouble with the second part ,
drink a lot of water .
now i &apos;ve got to go .
a hip @-@ hop star is thanking me at the vmas .
and so white @-@ bread ned
became the avenging sword of the lord .
peter , andrew ,
james the greater , james the lesser ,
john , philip , thaddeus .
heavenly father , i ...
quiet , you !
your next divine whack job is a twofer .
i command you to kill patty and selma bouvier .
patty and selma ?
sure they smoke , and they don &apos;t shave much of anything ,
but do they deserve to die ?
do not question me , the star of the bible .
now , on a non @-@ murder- related note ,
i want you to find out
what &apos;s making that funny noise in homer simpson &apos;s car .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s , you know ,
it &apos;s like a chigga @-@ chigga @-@ chigga @-@ chigga .
but you only hear it when you &apos;re driving over 30 .
and you never hear it when you take it to the shop .
then it sounds perfect .
yes , lord !
homer , have you noticed how many of your enemies
have died lately ?
mr. burns , sideshow bob ...
you forgot patty and selma .
oh , wait . that hasn &apos;t happened yet .
patty and selma ?
who &apos;s next , ned flanders ?
now , how would that work ?
okay , stupid flanders ,
first i want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor
who gave homer simpson a cone that had a little air in it .
really ?
come on ! god does crazy things !
check your old testament .
hey , dad .
hey bart ... uh , i mean , jesus .
hey son , you want flanders to kill anybody ?
he &apos;s totally in my power .

in class so i can &apos;t see the board .
and i sayeth unto you ,

homer simpson !
you made a killer out of me !
yeah , and what are you gonna do about it ?
i &apos;m going to kill you !
because of you , i &apos;m going to hell !
language .
hell ! damn ! backside !
nothing matters anymore !
i &apos;m goin &apos; down and my hand @-@ basket seats two !

there is no hell , and there is no god .
if there were , would he let me do this ?
why you little ...
what happened ? !
uh ... flanders killed homer .
but , but ...
but you &apos;re god .
couldn &apos;t you make everything the way it was ?
well , i could .
but the big man downstairs wouldn &apos;t like it .
get me a coffee !
yes , sir .
could this get any worse ?
honey , come back to bed .
oh , for cryin &apos; out loud !
people , you are on the most
inhospitable planet in the galaxy .
extreme temperatures ...
vicious indigenous life forms ...
are there any questions ? yes ?
are we in kansas anymore ?
no .
well , are we in nebraska ?
no ! we are not in any state !
oh , oh , is it michigan ?
nobody talk anymore !
you will now direct your attention to our c.e.o. ,
mr. krusty the clown .
we are here on this fakakta planet for one reason :
hilarium .
spray this in an audience and they &apos;ll laugh at anything .
and i need some now .
gotta play a nazi party rally .
oh , yeah , they &apos;re back .
our spies will go planet @-@ side ,
locate said hilarium
and contact us so that we may begin extraction .
this is a delicate mission that requires utter loyalty .
i can think of no better candidate
than the resentful guy in the wheelchair who has just arrived .
yes , i think this is gonna work out just fine .
all strapped in ?
yep .
now prepare to take an incredible journey across the room !
whoa ! check out this bitchin &apos; bod !
oh , man , if i could just have
five minutes alone with my old bullies ...
hey , avaturd .
are you guys gonna beat me up ?
naw , we can &apos;t .
these avatars cost $ 80 billion each .
but your human body costs nothing .
come on , let &apos;s bond , you stupid jerk .
that &apos;s a japanese outlet , bart.
you need an adapter .
oh , maybe i &apos;ll just take a taxi .
where you go ? where you go ?
no meter , is cheaper , yeah ?
no , thanks .
suit yourself , you one @-@ eyed bastard .
aw , the only thing that looks good on this stupid planet
are the bananas .
ay , caramba !
thanks , dude .
i am a female !
you don &apos;t have to yell !
i am not yelling ! this is my seductive voice !
i am called kamala .
oh ! even when we &apos;re monsters , he gets the girl .
fool ! every part of this world is alive !
apologize to sister rock !
sorry , sister rock .
now you &apos;ve murdered our brothers , the flowers !
stupid ! stupid !
now you &apos;re having sex with uncle tree !
thank the almighty fungus you are wiser
and cuter than your friend .
hey , what gives , man ?
and now let us touch testicles and mate for life .
don &apos;t you mean tentacles ?
i know what i said !
ay , caramba !
today you are a man . mazel tov !
so ... was it okay ?
it was serviceable !
ah , man , back on earth we don &apos;t have so many moons .
what do you mean , &quot; back on earth &quot; ?
uh ... it &apos;s a place on the other side of this planet that &apos;s ...
very rainy so you can only see one moon .
you know , like portland .
i never hear of this port @-@ land .
but on rigel seven ,
lack of eye contact and too many details
indicate the telling of truth .
i love you , sugar @-@ slime .
man , you are full of surprises .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m getting combat pay for this .
well done , young man !
our daughter is with child .
here .
feel the wonder of one million fetuses !
you said you were using birth control !
that only keeps me from giving birth while we are having sex .
how do those mountains float ?
they don &apos;t . they are falling .
now that kamala has a slug in the oven ,
we must make sure she gets her daily dose of hilarium .
without it , her crankiness will become unbearable .
unfortunately our environment is too hostile to grow pickles .
and the only flavor ice cream we have is butter brickle .
to repeat : no pickles , butter brickle .
it is the rigelian way .
so , where can i load up on this hilarium ?
listen closely .
the hilarium is found in the sacred secretions of the queen !
we have located the hilarium .
lock in on my signal .
traitor ! how dare you betray the planet i got laid on ? !
they &apos;re all in one place .
let &apos;s fry these calamari
and dip &apos; em in a sauce made of their own blood !
and wine from their own grapes .
that &apos;s not so bad .
it &apos;s a little bad .
so kamala ,
where do we keep all our tanks and planes and stuff ?
we have no tanks . our planet will protect us .
oh , man , you sound like my art teacher .
look a little like her , too .
i guess this is a good time
to tell you i &apos;ve been a double agent all this time .
but now i am totally on your side .
and this is a good time to tell you i have space warts .
and i got them from milhouse .
time for a good old @-@ fashioned
servo @-@ suit / bulldozer @-@ saurus fight !
dammit !
yo , colonel ! uh , you &apos;ve got some schmutz on your cheek .
where ? ... here ?
skinner ... !
had they asked for the hilarium ,
we would simply have given it to them .
in rigelian there is no word for &quot; yours &quot; or &quot; mine . &quot;
that &apos;s the reason we didn &apos;t enjoy the movie yours , mine and ours .
halloween is over , which means , america ,
it &apos;s time to start your christmas shopping .
infuse our stagnant economy
with dollars you don &apos;t really have .
and whatever you do , avoid the urge to make homemade gifts .
knitting one sweater for someone costs 27 americans their jobs .
and don &apos;t forget , christmas
is a wonderful time to take up alcoholism .
come on , you see your family all year round .
the holidays are for your bartender .
when are we doing the black swan ?
