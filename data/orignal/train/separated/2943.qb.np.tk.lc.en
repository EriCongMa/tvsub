this kitty is mittens . this one is fitzhugh .
and this little guy in the cat condo is jinkies .
that &apos;s a lot of cats , jo lynn .
single , are you ?
i &apos;ll get it .
okay .
chandler bing .
how come you &apos;re answering your own phone ? where &apos;s your crazy assistant ?
you &apos;re not crazy . you &apos;re not crazy .
otherwise , why would you have all those cats ?
what &apos;s up , joe ?
what have we always wanted to do together ?
braid each other &apos;s hair and ride horseback on the beach ?
no . no . no . when you get home tomorrow night ..
you and i are gonna be at the wizards @-@ knicks game , courtside !
courtside ? oh , my god !
yeah !
maybe michael jordan will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee !
that is so cool . i &apos;ll let monica know .
these need your signature .
listen , jo lynn , that was my friend joey . he calls everybody crazy .
hello ?
hey , hon , it &apos;s me .
hi . how &apos;s the crazy cat lady ?
joey just called .
he &apos;s got courtside knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night .
but tomorrow night &apos;s the only night i get off from the restaurant .
if you go , we won &apos;t have a night together for a week .
but honey , it &apos;s courtside ! the cheerleaders will be right in ..
that &apos;s not the way to convince you .
i don &apos;t wanna be one of those wives that says :
&quot; you can &apos;t go to the game . you have to spend time with me . &quot;
so if you could just realize it on your own ..
i know . you &apos;re right . i wanna see you too .
i gotta figure out a way to tell joey . he &apos;s looking forward to it .
tell him you haven &apos;t seen your wife in a long time .
tell him that having a long @-@ distance relationship is really difficult .
tell him that what little time we have together is precious .
i &apos;ll think of something .
the.one.with.rachels.phone.number
you look ..
i mean , it &apos;s just .. that dress ..
well , i hope the ends of these sentences are good .
they &apos;re good . it &apos;s just been a while since i &apos;ve seen you like this .
you clean up good .
really ? well , thank you .
okay , stop looking at me like that .
last time that happened , that happened .
right , right .
so are you excited about your first night away from emma ?
yeah , yeah . phoebe and l are gonna have so much fun .
thank you for watching the baby .
it &apos;s fine .
actually , i invited mike over .
phoebe &apos;s mike ?
yeah .
i didn &apos;t know you hung out .
we don &apos;t ..
but i &apos;d like to get to know him .
maybe have a little dinner , drinks , conversation .
that &apos;s so cute . ross and mike &apos;s first date .
it &apos;s not a date .
but if it turns out to be something more ..
i &apos;ll leave a tie on the door .
will that be awkward ? what are you gonna talk about ?
i don &apos;t know . but you know , we have a lot in common , you know ?
he plays piano . i played keyboards in college .
he &apos;s been divorced . i have some experience in that area .
yeah ?
hi !
girl &apos;s night out indeed .
so i think emma is probably down for the night ..
but if you need anything ..
we &apos;ll be fine .
you go have fun .
okay , you too .
thanks .
and i hope you score .
okay . bye .
bye .
so , welcome .
i got beer .
i got bottled breast milk .
why don &apos;t we start with the beer .
okay .
so phoebe tells me you play piano .
yeah .
you know , i used to play keyboards in college .
do you have one here ?
no .
okay .
you know , i &apos;m divorced .
phoebe .. phoebe says you &apos;re .. you &apos;ve been divorced ?
yeah , yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t really like to talk about it .
that &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll talk about something else .
this is a nice apartment .
thanks .
the moldings are all original .
i don &apos;t know if the moldings are original in my apartment .
so you &apos;re a paleontologist , right ?
yeah .
my cousin &apos;s a paleontologist .
well , he and i would probably have a lot to talk about .
welcome home .
well , look at you .
yeah . what do you think ?
well , it looks great . it &apos;s just ..
i &apos;m wearing the same thing underneath , so ..
you see what i mean ?
hey ! how come your door &apos;s locked ?
just a second !
no , no , no !
joey can &apos;t know i &apos;m here .
why not ?
i didn &apos;t want to say i couldn &apos;t go to the game ..
so i told him i had to stay in tulsa .
so you lied to him ?
it &apos;s always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion .
except with you .
hey , open the door ! what &apos;s going on ?
what are you .. ?
hi .
why are you dressed like that ?
because chandler &apos;s gonna be home in a couple of days ..
so i thought i would just , you know , practice the art of seduction .
i thought i heard a man &apos;s voice before .
no , i was just doing chandler &apos;s side of the conversation .
you know , like , &quot; hi , how do i look ? &quot;
&quot; really sexy . could i be any more turned on ? &quot; you know ?
okay . wait a minute .
why are there two glasses of wine out ?
because one of them is for you !
cheers ! okay , bye @-@ bye .
you know , it &apos;s funny . i &apos;ve been practicing the art of seduction myself .
you might wanna keep practicing .
yeah .
it &apos;s joey .
what ?
hey , joe .
dude , come home !
what ? why ?
come home !
look , i can &apos;t . what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know how to tell you this , but i think monica &apos;s cheating on you !
i told you , you shouldn &apos;t have married someone hotter than you !
if you can &apos;t deal with this , then i &apos;m gonna .
no !
i just heard him !
can you hear him now ?
no . all right , i &apos;m going in .
no , wait !
i heard him again !
all right , just stay there . i &apos;m coming home .
i &apos;ll see you when you get here .
i &apos;ll wait out in the hall in case he comes out .
is that really necessary ?
absolutely . you &apos;d do it for me .
not that you ever have to , because i know how to keep my women satisfied .
yeah , listen , thanks a lot .
okay , bye .
he thinks i &apos;m a slut .
oh , right , and you &apos;re supposed to be a fireman ?
shouldn &apos;t the pizza be here by now ?
i mean , they said 30 minutes or less . well , how long has it been ?
eleven minutes .
and now 12 .
so you wanna watch tv ?
you think i haven &apos;t thought of that ?
i mean , i would like to but the cable &apos;s out .
didn &apos;t seem like such a big deal until tonight .
so you like the beer ?
i do . i do .
although , it &apos;s actually a lager .
what &apos;s the difference between beer and lager ?
i don &apos;t know .
we could look it up .
things are about to get wild .
oh , god , remember the girls &apos; nights we used to have ..
sitting around talking about you and ross ?
oh , god ! it seems like forever ago .
i know .
so , what &apos;s going on with you and ross ?
well , i don &apos;t know . i mean , for a long time , nothing .
but you know , actually , right before you picked me up ..
ross and i had a little thing .
oh , my god ! i love things ! what happened ?
well , first he told me he liked how i looked .
and then we had a little ..
eye contact .
eye contact ?
i hope you were using protection .
excuse me , these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar .
oh , actually , i can &apos;t have another one on account of my breast milk .
okay .
hey , rach , maybe there &apos;s a less disgusting way to decline a drink .
should we send them something back ? let &apos;s send them mashed potatoes !
no , wait ! don &apos;t do that !
that &apos;ll make them think they can come over .
so , what if they do ?
we &apos;re not here to meet guys . you have a boyfriend . i have a baby and a ross .
yeah , but nothing has to happen . we &apos;re just having fun .
you know , not everything has to go as far as eye contact .
chandler , you have to tell joey you &apos;re not in tulsa .
isn &apos;t it better for him to think you &apos;re cheating on me ..
than for him to think i &apos;m cheating on him ?
i heard it .
i don &apos;t want him to think i &apos;m having an affair .
all right , i &apos;ve got a plan . i &apos;ll go down the fire escape ..
because all good plans start with , &quot; i &apos;ll go down the fire escape . &quot;
hear me out , woman !
i &apos;ll go down the fire escape and wait .
then it &apos;ll be like i just got back from tulsa .
joey and i will come in and see that there &apos;s no guy in here .
aren &apos;t you afraid that joey &apos;s gonna figure all this out ?
i heard it .
i &apos;m gonna wait .
the scary pigeon &apos;s back ?
it &apos;s huge .
i can &apos;t believe you live in that building . my grandmother lives in that building !
ida greene ? no sense of personal space ..
kind of smells like chicken , looks like a potato .
&quot; spuds &quot; is your grandmother ?
that &apos;s my bubbe !
so we &apos;re on our way to a couple of parties .
maybe we could get your numbers and call if we find something fun ?
yeah . i &apos;m sorry , we weren &apos;t really looking for anything to happen ..
with you guys . i have a boyfriend .
all right .
it &apos;s no big deal .
just out of curiosity , which one of you was for me ?
that would &apos;ve been me .
nice .
different situation , cowboy , and you would &apos;ve had yourself a handful .
so she has a boyfriend . what is your situation ?
well , it &apos;s complicated . i don &apos;t actually have a boyfriend , but ..
then can i have your number ?
i &apos;m sorry , no .
okay .
oh , sure !
oh , my god , you &apos;re giving your real number !
okay , thanks . i &apos;ll give you a call later tonight .
great .
bye .
bye .
so that &apos;s great .
you , bill , ross and emma are gonna be so happy together .
what were you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know . he was cute , and he liked me . it was an impulse .
like when i bought these shoes . they were cute and they liked me too .
but what about ross ? what about your moment ?
we had a moment . we looked at each other .
maybe if we live together for another 10 years , we may hold hands !
but you were really excited about it .
don &apos;t you wanna talk to him ?
no .
no , because i know exactly how the conversation &apos;s gonna go .
&quot; hey , ross , you know , i think we had a moment before . &quot;
&quot; yeah . me too . &quot;
&quot; well , but i &apos;m not sure i really want to do anything about it . &quot;
&quot; yeah . me neither . &quot;
&quot; should we just live together ..
and not tell each other how we &apos;re feeling ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , that works for me . &quot;
yeah , i see what you mean .
by the way , nice ross imitation .
your rachel wasn &apos;t whiny enough .
well .. hey !
better .
the point is maybe i should just stop waiting around for moments with ross .
you know ? i should just move on with my life .
so really , you &apos;re moving on from ross ?
i don &apos;t know . do i have to decide right now ?
you kind of just did . that guy is gonna call you tonight .
ross will pick up the phone , and that &apos;s a pretty clear message .
oh , my god , ross !
ross is gonna pick up the phone .
i have to get my number back . oh , my god , he &apos;s gone !
&quot; oh , i have to get my number back ! oh , my god ! he &apos;s gone ! &quot; dead on .
you know , i &apos;m gonna take off .
so soon ?
yeah .
okay .
well , thanks .. thanks for the beer .
you mean lager ?
yeah . good times .
okay .
all right .
hello ?
hey , mike , it &apos;s me .
listen , is .. is ross near you ?
no , i just left .
and that , right there , is the most interesting conversation i &apos;ve had all night .
really ? okay .
well , you have to go back in .
what ? go back ? to the land where time stands still ?
i &apos;m so sorry , honey , but ..
okay , rachel gave this guy her number ..
and she doesn &apos;t want ross to answer the phone .
so you have to intercept all his calls .
i can &apos;t do that !
he says he can &apos;t do that .
give me the phone .
hi , mike . hi , listen , i know that this is a lot to ask , but you know what ?
if you do this , phoebe will do anything you want .
seriously , i &apos;m talking dirty stuff .
all right . thank you . hello ?
hi , i &apos;m sorry about her . but actually , she wasn &apos;t wrong about the dirty stuff .
all right , i &apos;ll do it .
but really , how much dirtier can it get ?
oh , mike .
bye .
hey , buddy .
hi .
can i come back in ?
why ?
well , i was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about .
but you left .
that didn &apos;t take long .
i thought you said tulsa was , like , a three @-@ hour flight ?
well , you &apos;re forgetting about the time difference .
you ready ? i &apos;m gonna go in there with you .
thanks .
just in case there &apos;s more than one dude in there .
again , thanks .
yeah .
chandler , you &apos;re home !
that &apos;s right ! your husband &apos;s home ! so now the sex can stop !
you know what i mean .
what are you saying ?
joey said you &apos;re here with another man !
there &apos;s no man in here ! how dare you accuse me of that !
all right . then maybe you won &apos;t mind if me and my friend take a look around .
he can &apos;t even see us !
i kind of liked it .
me too .
what &apos;s he doing ?
i arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy .
bedroom &apos;s clear . although you might need some new pillows .
all right , well , i &apos;ll check the guest room .
why do i smell men &apos;s cologne ?
i think that &apos;s you .
oh , yeah . i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier .
there &apos;s nobody here , joe .
i guess not .
i can &apos;t believe you thought i was cheating . you owe me an apology .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s an honest mistake .
it could happen to anybody . see you .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
if you just got back from tulsa , how did your suitcase beat you here ?
i climbed down the fire escape , and you can &apos;t put that in the closet ?
so , with the exception of the fermentation process ..
beer and ale are basically the same thing .
fascinating , isn &apos;t it ?
maybe you should look up &quot; fascinating . &quot;
i &apos;ll get it !
hello ? ross &apos; place . mike speaking .
it &apos;s for you .
i don &apos;t understand what just happened here .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i told you i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend the night with monica ..
and i didn &apos;t know .. i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d understand .
you think i &apos;m too dumb to understand a husband needs to be with his wife ?
you think i &apos;m , like ..
joey ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know what to say . we shouldn &apos;t have lied to you .
i feel so bad . is there anything i can do to make it up to you ?
you could go to the game with me . even though you said you couldn &apos;t .
but then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head .
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s the one thing i can &apos;t do . i promised i &apos;d be with monica .
all right .
you can go .
what ?
you should go to the game . it &apos;s okay . i want you to .
really ? you gonna be okay ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be fine .
you know , maybe i &apos;ll stay here and practice the art of seduction .
you &apos;re gonna put sweats on and clean .
it &apos;s gonna be so hot !
bye .
bye .
thanks .
here &apos;s your ticket .
thanks . hey , listen ..
i &apos;m never gonna lie to you again , okay ?
and i want you to know that nobody thinks you &apos;re stupid .
