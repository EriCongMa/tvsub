It's a total loss.
Your credit cards are just the tip of the iceberg.
You've been hacked.
The web address contained a compressed video file.
That's my apartment.
From before the fire.
Wasn't an accident.
Is that Lianne Sampson?
What?
The victim from the scene I just came from.
She had a tattoo of a butterfly on her left wrist.
Isles.
Homicide?
I'm on my way.
Hello?
Hello?
Keys in her car. Wallet's in her purse.
They didn't want anything but Maura.
Look, we got roadblocks at all the major thoroughfares.
We got every camera, public and private,
in the neighborhood.
All units that are available are on the way.
We're talking to everyone we can find.
What was she doin' here?
I spoke to dispatch. There was no incident at this location.
Obviously, she thought there was.
She brought her medical bag.
Somebody made her think there was.
Can I touch that right now?
Sure.
Uh, this isn't official.
Must've got it at a party shop.
I'll bet he picked this location
because there wouldn't be any looky-loos
to give it away as a fake crime scene.
Guys, the last call that she got
before I tried her was from an internal B.P.D. number.
You think someone from the department
is involved with this?
Get back to headquarters.
You find out where that call came from.
There's a black smudge there. Might be a footprint.
If I wasn't so concentrated on ma, then --
This is not your fault.
How could you possibly anticipate
that someone would lure Maura into a trap?
You were just protecting
the most vulnerable person in your circle.
And Maura -- - Is strong.
She's smart. She is capable.
She will do her part.
Now we have to do our part, right?
Detective Rizzoli.
Yeah?
I think I found some blood,
maybe some other biological material.
It's okay. It's just a little bit,
Which is a good thing, right?
Fast track everything,
including that black stuff over there.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's great. We -- we -- we got some blood
and a phone number and a footprint.
That's not a lot to go on.
Doesn't mean we won't find her. Hmm?
We'll find her.
That B.P.D. number in Maura's call log
came from operations.
There's been a shift change since it was placed,
so all the people who were working have gone home.
We reached out and asked everyone to come back in.
Jane.
Did you hear what we said?
Yeah.
And if those people aren't back here in 15 minutes,
then send uniforms to go get 'em.
You really think this is an inside job?
I hope not, but based on what we know,
that's where we gotta start.
Jane, are you okay?
Yeah.
'Cause you've been up a long time.
S--we all have. Uh...
Okay, Lianne Sampson's murder
and Maura's abduction are related,
so anything that we need for either case --
Uh, warrants, private security videos,
shoe leather -- I'll get it.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, and, uh, we need to put a trap and trace
on maura's cell phone and her home phone,
just in case the kidnappers call.
Already done.
And we also rerouted your air card
so we can keep an eye on you.
Okay.
Chief wants a task force, but because we can't rule out
that someone from B.P.D. is involved,
he's gonna give us 24 hours before he puts it in motion.
We don't have 24 hours.
This isn't a standard kidnapping.
And just because we don't get a demand for ransom in 12 hours,
it doesn't mean they've decided to kill her.
No, that's true. She could already be dead.
How about we work more, randomly theorize less?
Fair enough.
Hi. You hear anything?
No.
What's this?
Turkey sandwich, side of carrot,
baked sweet potato chips, and a brownie.
Homemade brownie.
Thank you, ma.
Hey, ma.
Everyone from the previous dispatch shift
has been contacted
and should be in the building within a half an hour.
Okay, good.
Tuna fish.
Thanks, ma.
How you doing?
All I can do is make sandwiches, so lousy.
You know...
I worked so hard
to deal with my feelings about your job.
I just didn't know I was supposed to be dealing
with my feelings for her job, too.
We're gonna find her, ma.
Tell Korsak...
That's ham and cheese.
Still working on the footprint.
What about the blood?
The D.N.A. tests are in process,
should be back any minute.
But the blood's o-positive, so...
It's not hers.
No.
Possibly the perpetrator was injured during the abduction.
Well, it's not random.
She bit him or punched him in the nose,
just something to leave us a breadcrumb.
You...do know that in the fairy tale,
the breadcrumbs lead to the witch's house,
which led the children...
Oh. Which is neither here nor there, is it?
It's not a witch. It's not a big, bad wolf.
It's just some jackass that we gotta get to
before he hurts maura.
Right.
Hey, uh, D.N.A. results came back.
No match in our system,
but we are we looking for a white male,
probably of middle European descent.
That's it?
Yeah.
I know it's not very helpful.
Well, it eliminates people,
and that's better than adding them, right?
I'll pass it along.
All right.
Look, I've been through this dispatch log twice.
No incoming calls at that time
would've required a referral to the M.E.'s office.
Okay, but the call that Dr. Isles received
did come from your department.
I can't explain that.
You having problems with anybody who works for you?
No.
Anybody leave sick last night?
Stan Mcqueen.
Is he a white male?
Yes.
Mcqueen's not our guy.
He's been in a wheelchair since before you joined the force.
Some kind of a boating accident.
Detectives, everyone in operations
has been thoroughly vetted.
They wouldn't do something like this.
Okay, well, someone called the M.E.'s office,
and they knew enough about our dispatch process
to fool Dr. Isles.
So have you seen anyone unusual?
Has anyone been nosin' around,
asking questions? Anything.
Sergeant Miller?
Last week, I got a call from an eighth grade girl
who said she was doing a report on the 9-1-1 system.
She asked about our process and protocols.
What, like how calls come in?
Or when we call the M.E.'s office?
Things like that?
Yeah.
Okay, we need to know exactly when you got that call
so we can trace it.
Of course.
I'll have to check the logs downstairs.
Like now.
I'll meet you back in the squad room.
All right.
What do you got, Holiday?
Based on the time that Sergeant Miller gave you,
I tracked the call he received to a burner phone.
Turns out that same phone pinged off a cell tower
near Maura's abduction site,
at the time of her abduction.
Then why did her caller I.D. show an internal B.P.D. number?
There are apps that will let you spoof your caller I.D.
it's illegal to use them for criminal purposes,
but as long as you're already involved in a criminal activity...
Why sweat the small stuff?
Exactly.
Is it also easy to pretend you're a 13-year-old girl?
Or did our kidnapper get a teenager involved?
Go ahead.
Go ahead what?
Go ahead what?
Maura's abduction was not an inside job.
No, and our fake teenage call to dispatch
came in last week,
so the kidnapper had time to plan things.
Probably gonna make him much harder to find.
I know.
Anything?
The tarry substance that made the smudges at the crime scene,
that was from bleeding asphalt.
Please tell me you have something more than that,
because there's about 35,000 miles of road in Massachusetts.
35,590, to be precise.
But who's counting?
Yeah, I did find something else.
There was a small paint chip in the tar,
the top layer of which was lead-based.
Lead paint was banned in 1975.
Exactly.
Now this particular pigment
was only purchased by municipalities between 1973 and 1977.
When government buildings were required to either
paint over the lead paint or remove it completely.
Well, so what?
You think the abductor has got Maura
in some abandoned government building?
Which narrows our locations down from thousands to...
several hundred? Maybe?
Yeah.
I hope.
Uh, did you get anything else from the sample?
Yeah, we're working on it.
What about you? Did you find anything?
Um, just a list of people that were in prison with Lianne Sampson
and paroled in the last year.
I'm gonna go through 'em, see if I can find any connection.
Do you think Lianne Sampson would be imprisoned
with the kind of people who would commit murder?
Probably not.
Right, so that's a bit of a...
Bit of a stretch, yeah.
Look...I hope you don't mind if I say, but...
You look awful.
Thanks.
No, really, you look like...
I mean, when's the last time you slept?
I...Don't know. A-a day or two?
Maybe you should have a nap.
N.A.S.A. pilots who slept for 40 minutes
increased their alertness by 54%.
Is that a fact?
Yeah.
Well, you can take your fact and shove it up your...
首席法医
Don't worry, Jane.
I'll take good care of her.
I came looking for you, and I found you asleep.
I was looking at lists.
I was, uh, I was looking for, um...
It's okay to take a short nap, Janie.
You've been up for a long time.
You okay?
No.
I'm not.
What is all this?
Purchase orders and contracts for all the abandoned
government buildings in Massachusetts.
Turns out that the paint chip that Kent found
was five different layers of paint.
So we have to look through all of this stuff and...
Figure out which building was painted in this order.
That's gonna take forever.
No, it's not.
Now that we know it's not an inside job,
we're a task force. We have all the assets we need.
Detective Rizzoli's in charge.
Good to meet you.
Talk to him.
Okay.
Wait. Where you goin'?
Gotta deliver warrants to
search the databases of all the cell phone towers in Boston.
All right, so we have to figure out which one of these buildings
was painted in this order.
All right.
What'd you find?
I pulled the records for all the cell phones
that pinged off the tower near Maura's abduction,
just in case our perpetrator was carrying his own phone.
That was good thinking.
I got 25 names,
one more interesting than the rest.
Joe Harris.
Psychiatrist from M.C.I. Framingham's Women's Prison.
He treated Lianne.
Frankie interviewed him during the murder investigation.
Where is his phone now?
Pinging off a tower near the prison.
Call the warden. Tell her to find him,
hold on to him till I get there.
Already done.
Send a full background to my phone.
And...
Done.
Shit.
Double shit.
Hope?
Thanks for calling me back.
I, uh...
I hate to have to tell you this over the phone,
but something's happened,
and I don't want you to hear it on the news.
Yeah, yes.
Yes, it's -- it's Maura. She's been abducted.
We searched the prison and all the outlying areas.
He's not here.
I have someone pulling security video
to see what time he left.
I'll let you know as soon as we find out.
How long has he been here?
Two years. Came from Lauson Prison upstate.
What do you think of him?
It's hard to get a good therapist here.
They-- they make so much money in private practice.
But Harris was solid. The women seemed to respect him.
He was compassionate, not a pushover.
I can't imagine he'd have anything to do with this.
We'll see. Could be his phone being nearby is just a coincidence.
I don't have a search warrant, so I can't look in there
without your permission.
Of course.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Korsak, Harris is definitely our guy. Hang on.
I need everything that you have on him right now.
We gotta find this guy.
It's a little cold in here.
I'm gonna bring you a blanket.
Okay?
let's get you up.
Let's get you up.
Okay, now...
If it's money you want, I can get you money.
Come on. If I wanted your money, I'd already have it, right?
Then what is this about? What do you want?
First in your class in medical school.
First medical examiner
to head the New England medical organization.
Peer reviewer for five medical journals.
You really expect me to believe
you don't know what this is about? Hmm?
It's a good look for ya.
I don't know what this is about.
I know you studied psychology in school.
Profile me. Peer to peer. What do you think?
Dissociative personality disorder
with aberrant functional connectivity
in the default mode network?
Aah! That's for biting me.
Okay, say "Cheese."
I...
Love...
Isles.
I've already put in a request
with Joe Harris' cell phone company
for his home locator records,
so we can track his recent movements.
Okay, let me know if that's not happening fast enough.
Once I get it, I'll start cross-referencing his movements
with the list of abandoned government buildings
we got from the paint chip.
A lot of those are gonna be in urban areas...
Places that he'd drive by on his normal commute.
I know, but I'm hoping all this digging
will help us narrow it down.
Also sent his picture to all law enforcement agencies
on the Eastern Seaboard, put a B.O.L.O. out on his car.
And Korsak has assigned uniforms to sit on his apartment,
his parents' house, and the bar he likes on the south side.
Have you found any evidence that this guy and I know each other?
I suppose you could've met at a restaurant.
Professionally, I-I haven't found anything.
Maybe at the prison?
Is that list of prisoners that he's seen come in yet?
They called 30 minutes ago, said it would be ready in an hour.
Thank you.
For what, doing my job?
Yeah. And for...
making sure I don't let anything slip through the cracks.
I'm a little...
Frayed?
You really should get some sleep.
I know.
You have no idea why this guy would go after you?
No...Which I think would make sleeping difficult,
so I'm gonna get some coffee. You want anything?
No.
You're very photogenic,
which is unfortunate
because I need you to play a different part right now,
not audition for "Cats."
"Cats" closed a long time ago.
I never paid much attention to Broadway.
I really don't wanna hit you again.
It seems unsporting, you being tied up and all.
Then tell me what part I'm supposed to be playing.
Oh. Here we go. Perfect.
Little fear, some pleading,
just a hint of hope
that someone might actually save you.
Jane Rizzoli got under your skin.
No, she didn't.
You think that picture with a little blood on my lip
is gonna bother her.
That's the plan.
If you really wanted to get a rise out of her,
why didn't you kidnap one of her sisters?
Because stealing you from right under her nose was more fun.
Don't worry. It'll all be over soon.
You'll play the part of innocent victim.
Jane Rizzoli can play the ineffectual detective
as she watches you die.
I-I-I know I'm not always the easiest person to be around.
It's the stress of the job.
I mean, it's just -- it's the focus I gotta give it.
I think people understand that.
I mean, my mom, yeah.
You know, she gives me a hard time sometimes,
but that's...It's just 'cause she worries about me.
Worries about my brother.
Hell, I worry about my brother.
He made a choice, right, to carry a badge?
Worry's just part of it.
You know, I just -- I never thought that -- that...
that I was supposed to worry about them, you know?
I never dreamed that somebody was gonna try to hurt me
by hurting them.
You understand what I'm saying, Eduardo?
Lo siento, detective. No hablo inglés.
I know.
¿Con permiso?
Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Gracias.
Any updates?
Yeah, I, uh, I sent that paint chip
off to the lab at M.I.T.
They have a machine that does Raman spectroscopy.
Still waiting on the results.
Okay, great.
Did you need something else?
I guess I was just wondering
if there's anything I can do to help.
I'm... feeling a little bit impotent.
We've eliminated 90 buildings so far
based on the 5-layer criteria that you gave us.
We have a lot of records to go through still,
trying to narrow the list.
I-I can help with that.
This is a public works building in Newton.
Jane, do you have a copy of Kent's paint analysis
for him to use as reference?
No need. I have a photographic memory.
You know, this reminds me of a class I did in edinburgh.
It was all about archaeology
We work in silence.
Yeah, okey-doke. We work in silence.
That's not silence.
We've been digging into Joe Harris' cell phone.
Maybe he doesn't carry it all the time,
but if he has been, it doesn't seem like
he's gone any further out of Boston than the prison
over the last two weeks.
That doesn't fit
with how meticulously planned this all is.
But the phone has circled the area...
of a former mental hospital -- the Arkush asylum.
We didn't have records for that building.
Yeah, Harris doesn't live in the area.
No one from his list of contacts does either.
And he hasn't made a single credit card purchase
anywhere near there.
He has no reason to be there?
Not any that we can find.
Scramble a tactical team. Radio silence.
I don't want him to hurt Maura if he hears us coming.
You stay.
Got it.
I don't know.
I -- yes. I-I-I probably had my phone on me. I...
No. No, I-I definitely left it in my desk
when I came back from the prison.
Are you sure they know I'm involved?
No. I would never tell them about you.
Yes.
That's a good idea.
The tunnel.
Yes.
And -- and I-I need you to know that I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm -- I'm -- I'm really, really sorry.
But I will fix it.
There's -- they will never find us.
Yes, I'll -- I'll destroy it immediately, I promise.
I know. You, too.
Well, you're wrong about your friend.
Apparently, she cares a great deal that I have you.
You can end this.
Just leave me here and make a run for it.
I don't like to leave things unfinished.
You're a therapist.
Oh, did I give that away
with "Aberrant functional connectivity"?
How many times have you told your patients
that just because they make one mistake
doesn't mean they have to make two?
Hundreds of times, darling.
But I talk to prisoners. They rarely listen.
And when they do?
Small victories.
So this can be another small victory.
Whoever that was on the phone
is not gonna take responsibility for this. You are.
Yes, you're very persuasive, Dr. Isles.
I'm sure that works for you a lot of the time.
Now relax, darling.
Clear.
This is the last room on this floor.
I'm headed down a level.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that?
You smell that?
What is it?
That's that -- that's that perfume that Maura wears.
Eau de...something.
She was here.
Yeah.
Until reinforcements get here,
let's stick to the major thoroughfares
except for this 2-lane road that leads out of here.
And we haven't found his car yet.
Remind the guys to keep their eyes open for it.
Will do.
We searched the whole building. There's no sign of them.
The hell made him leave?
I don't know.
And I can't figure out his endgame either.
You think he would've made contact,
leave us some kind of message.
Well, clearly he's got some kind of plan.
He's just not ready to put into motion yet.
Korsak, is it possible that he knew we were coming,
and that's why he moved her?
So still an inside job, just not the way we thought?
Maybe, yeah. Maybe somebody at the prison.
That seems more likely.
Looks like he had her chained near the radiator,
and then moved her to the chair.
Yeah.
Korsak.
T...U...N...N-- tunnel.
I'll try to catch ward.
I'll have dispatch put roadblocks up in front of the tunnels.
They found his car in an indoor parking lot
about 3 miles from the asylum.
Yeah, he must've parked it and walked back
so we wouldn't see it here.
They're sending video from the parking lot.
I'll go through all the cars exiting,
see if I can find him.
Thanks, Mrs. Rizzoli.
Hey, ma.
Hi, Jane. How are you?
Hey, I couldn't find anyone to talk to.
About what?
Oh, hi.
About what?
Eh, the test results that came back from M.I.T.
The paint was never exposed to any form of sunlight.
The oxidation of the layers were such
that it was most likely kept in a cold environment.
Well, that would make sense.
Maura was trying to tell us about a tunnel.
But not a tunnel that was exposed
to temperature variations.
Our paint chip had never been exposed to high temperatures.
Which means car tunnels are out.
Those are like ovens in the summer.
Yeah, we searched the entire asylum.
There aren't any tunnels here.
That's because according to the blueprints,
Arkush doesn't have tunnels.
Sure, it does. I remember when Jane was little,
there was some kind of accident, a cave-in,
and a couple of the patients died.
All right, we'll search again.
Holiday,
send me something helpful, all right?
These are the only blueprints I have.
I-I don't have any other information.
Don't let that stop you.
What can I do?
Call the public library.
Uh, get a librarian to help with newspaper archives.
I'm gonna figure out the date of this tunnel collapse.
Okay, so all the entrances are sealed.
But according to this picture,
there's an entrance somewhere near two utility pipes.
All right.
Hey, I got it this way.
I got it.
So he used the shelving to hide the entrance.
This way.
Ready?
Yeah.
Ready?
All right.
Okay.
According to Nina,
there are two sets of tunnels, yeah...
Each leading to exits in other buildings.
The southernmost tunnel is the one that collapsed.
Why don't you guys go together?
I'll take the southern tunnel.
Wait, Frankie...
Janie, I got it.
Be careful, detective.
You, too.
Fresh.
Maura!
Oh, God. Jane.
Are you all right?
The blood, it isn't mine.
Do you know where he is?
No. No, I-I just -- I r-ran.
I was hiding. I couldn't...
couldn't figure out how to get out of here.
You go. I'll take her out of here.
Jane, be careful. He's not working alone.
Okay. Can you walk?
Yeah.
You're okay. You're okay.
Frankie!
God.
Are you all right?
No, I'm -- I'm fine.
I fired off a shot.
He shot back and hit the wall, and this stuff fell on me.
And I...knocked my head a bit.
Yeah, he went off to the right.
I think I heard him go up some stairs.
Okay.
I-I-I'm fine. Go!
‭Go.
仅供关押犯法病人
West annex roof, fire escape!
Drop it!
Call E.M.T.S now!
Don't you move!
Who are you working for, Harris?
Who are you working for?!
You don't even know me.
Why me?
Why me?
Why not?
Hang on.
Jane.
Are you alright?
How is she?
Surface abrasions, single facial hemotoma.
Okay.
What she said. We are taking her to general for full workup.
Okay.
Did he hurt you?
He just wants to scare me.
Well, he's dead. Okay?
You don't have to worry about him anymore.
I heard him on the phone.
He wasn't working alone.
This isn't over.
It's over for now.
What did he want?
It doesn't matter, okay? He's dead.
You're safe.
Okay?
Okay...um...
I'll come straight to the hospital as soon as I wrap up here.
Okay.
Be careful.
We need uniforms outside of her room 24/7.
It's already taken care of.
Did Harris say anything?
No.
So we don't know much more than yesterday.
No. Just somebody out there
is really pissed off at me.
I wish that narrowed it down a little more than it does.
Sorry.
I'm an asshole.
Hey, you wanna drive so you can feel in charge?
No.
Really?
You're okay. You're okay.
