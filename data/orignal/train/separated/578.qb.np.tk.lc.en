i can &apos;t believe this is our 20th
and final anthropology diorama of the year .
i can &apos;t believe our assignment
is making a diorama of us making our 19th diorama .
i know , it &apos;s weird .
oh , come on . my forehead is not this big .
uh , troy , can you pass me that paintbrush ?
my monkey !
my monkey took that paintbrush and then went into that vent .
oh , i miss him so much .
someone &apos;s got to go after him .
i got this .
what are you doing ?
trust me . i know these vents like the back of my chang .
holy ...
is that a new stereotype ?
oh , my god .
did you find him ?
is that a new stereotype ?
no , and no .
but there &apos;s all kinds of stuff in here .
guys , you won &apos;t believe this .
it &apos;s like a sentimental treasure pile .
oh , that &apos;s my spoon .
no !
oh , hubba bubba . cool .
i thought they stopped making this .
第二季 第二十一集
and that &apos;s all of it .
that &apos;s good .
that means you can put your clothes back on .
nuh @-@ uh . i &apos;m going back in .
why ?
monkey took my spoon .
it &apos;s like a reverse cow birth .
annie , look , all of your purple pens are here .
do you remember when you got so mad
because you thought someone was stealing them ?
there are so many memories in this pile .
look .
whoa . the deputy &apos;s badge
from when we spent that day in that old ghost town .
oh , yeah .
we have to find the saloon .
every building is a saloon .
we got to go !
get the tarnation back here , you city slicking sons of--
that was , like , one of the best days of the whole year ,
and i almost totally forgot about it .
we almost totally got shot .
yeah , but by a prospector in red long underwear .
how cool was that ?
glad you had fun .
by the way , that dude was hard @-@ core racist ,
like 1800s disney @-@ style .
we learned new ways to hate ourselves .
hey , glee club trophy .
you guys remember when we had to fill in for glee club ?
* sing a @-@ ling @-@ a @-@ ling *
* sing a @-@ ling @-@ a @-@ ling , ding dong *
* sing a @-@ ling @-@ a @-@ ling sing a @-@ ling @-@ a @-@ ling , ding dong *
* sing a @-@ ling @-@ a @-@ ling , sing a @-@ ling @-@ a @-@ ling , ding dong *
* sing , sing , sing , sing , sing , sing , sing *
guys , that &apos;s not a fond memory .
we won , like , 70 awards .
yeah , but the reason we had to fill in for glee club
was because they ...
died .
their bus crashed .
i know , but i was remembering around that part .
yeah , focus on the positives ,
like we got that cool new bus driver .
nice try , britta ,
but the truth is it &apos;s been a dark year .
pierce got hooked on painkillers .
shirley &apos;s having an unplanned baby .
and , apparently , chang is in the group now ?
it &apos;s true . god hates us .
remember when abed had a total mental breakdown at christmas ?
that was adorable and magical .
he thought everything was claymation .
yeah . but everything wasn &apos;t .
and what do you see now , abed ?
a candy cane forest .
we &apos;re all running through the candy cane forest .
oh , careful , britta bot . don &apos;t trip on a gumdrop .
oh , no , i tripped ... on a gumdrop !
yay . let &apos;s find santa some more .
well , i think this year was awesome--
full of good times with great people .
come on , you guys .
stop focusing on all the bad stuff and dig deep .
abed , you &apos;re a computer .
scan your mainframe for some juicy memories .
jeff and britta are having secret sex .
exhibit &quot; a &quot; --the one thing i do remember from halloween .
hi .
hi .
you need some help in there ?
yeah , well , i can &apos;t use my hands in this costume , so ...
well--
exhibit &quot; b &quot; --something i overheard during christmas .
why would i want to be in a school that hates christmas ?
he &apos;s got a point . kidding .
what are you doing later ? how about some holiday benefits ?
hey , ixnay in front of uncan @-@ day .
and finally exhibit &quot; c &quot; -- the curious circumstances
following the exciting conclusion
of our st. patrick &apos;s day adventure .
kind of like it .
really ?
yeah ...
felt like it was distracting--
abed ! uh ...
uh , a @-@ a @-@ a leprechaun took our clothes .
and you can never tell anyone , okay ?
okay , so we hooked up a few times ,
but there &apos;s a much larger issue here .
we are friends with a grown man
that clearly believes in leprechauns .
didn &apos;t we decide at the beginning of the year
that for the good of the group , we wouldn &apos;t allow any intimacy
between each other or ourselves ?
troy , we never said ourselves .
okay , now i &apos;m really mad .
so am i.
now we know why our year &apos;s been so horrible .
it &apos;s not god that hates us . it &apos;s jeff and britta .
oh , please .
if we were ruining your year ,
why didn &apos;t you even know about it ?
maybe we were so distracted
by all the other times you two put yourselves before the group .
what ?
when have we ever put ourselves before the group ?
you want examples ?
i think they want some examples , pierce .
okay , let &apos;s give &apos; em some examples .
troy , drop a beat .
just give &apos; em some examples .
fine .
chipmunk .
mm , impressive , mr. winger .
someone &apos;s going to regionals .
it &apos;s a special cape . a cape for justice--
what are you doing ?
there &apos;s rioting in tunisia !
the cape is premiering .
humanity is premiering , you jags .
we need to talk .
these people are giving out free iphones !
what ?
no !
this habitat was for humanity .
whoever did it , step forward .
you five are in big trouble .
jeff and britta , you &apos;re free to go ,
because you didn &apos;t step forward and are therefore innocent .
you can &apos;t ignore the facts .
you two are ruining this group .
look , just because we &apos;re good @-@ looking
doesn &apos;t make us villains .
yeah , are you sure you guys have
the group &apos;s best interests at heart ?
feast your ear tongues on these memory pops .
pierce , you &apos;ve had three flu shots .
that &apos;s for the day care center .
i &apos;ll be a living god !
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re considering the exciting opportunity
of selling lady miss lady cosmetics .
please , uh , open your starter kits .
okay , now that the seals have been broken ,
you each owe me $ 50 .
i &apos;m jeff winger .
does this hard @-@ boiled egg make me look fat ?
my name is jeff winger .
i love working this blackberry ,
because it really tones my thumbs .
it was a particularly small egg .
that &apos;s why i was asking .
you can yell at me all you want .
i &apos;ve seen enough movies to know that popping the back of a raft
makes it go faster .
that show &apos;s gonna last three weeks !
six seasons and a movie !
pierce , you can &apos;t sneak up on me like that .
when i &apos;m startled , my training takes over .
hello !
ki @-@ yah !
those are just stories about us being cute .
you guys actually go out of your way
to endanger the fabric of this group .
yeah , leave our fabric alone .
you guys aren &apos;t seeing the bigger picture .
we compartmentalized our libidos
for the good of the group .
oh , you compartmentalized , did you ?
then what &apos;s been going on with us all year ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the annie of it all--
the long looks , the stolen glances ,
the general atmosphere of &quot; would they , might they ? &quot;
annie , i think you &apos;re reading into some things .
oh , really ?
* something always brings me back to you *
* it never takes too long *
* no matter what i say or do *
* i still feel you here *
* till the moment i &apos;m gone *
* you hold me without touch *
* keep me without chains *
* i never wanted anything so much *
* than to drown in your love *
* and not feel your rain *
* set me free *
* leave me be *
* i don &apos;t want to fall another moment *
* into your gravity *
oh , give me a break .
i mean , you could do the same thing with pierce and abed .
* something always brings me back to you *
* it never takes too long *
* no matter what i say or do *
* i still feel you here *
* till the moment i &apos;m gone *
* you hold me without touch *
* keep me without chains *
yeah , but , jeff , let &apos;s be honest ,
there &apos;s more between you and annie
than there is between me and pierce .
how dare you ?
abed , it &apos;s called chemistry .
i have it with everybody .
everybody ?
i haven &apos;t felt any of that chemistry coming my way .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s because you &apos;re racist
or because i intimidate you sexually ,
but i know it &apos;s one of those two .
dean @-@ a @-@ ling @-@ a @-@ ling .
i was just heading to judge our belated carnival
when i heard you guys having a tiff .
what &apos;s the rumpus ?
we were debating how many times per year
a man can drop in a study room
in a dumb costume with irrelevant news .
dean @-@ yow !
it &apos;s feline aids awareness day , folks ,
so let &apos;s whip it in the keister .
* dean , dean , dean , dean , dean , dean *
* dean , dean , dean , dean
guys , greendale &apos;s music department
is flat &quot; baroque , &quot; so we are having a fund @-@ raiser .
what &apos;s dean got to do with it ?
why , it &apos;s time to tina &quot; turner &quot; the clocks ahead .
happy daylight savings !
deanie , vidi , vici !
i came , i saw , i conquered the idea
of a free caesar @-@ salad bar in the cafeteria .
frankly , my dear , i don &apos;t give a dean .
that &apos;s right , greendale presents &quot; gone with the windows , &quot;
where we &apos;ll celebrate our new energy @-@ conscious windows
with a cotillion .
whoop .
okay .
well , i guess we don &apos;t see our patterns
until they &apos;re all laid out in front of us .
thank you for being so nice about it .
oh , dean . dean .
can we please stop fighting ?
we &apos;re starting to hurt innocent perverts .
i don &apos;t want to stop .
we &apos;re airing out all this dirty laundry .
after that , we &apos;ll stop fighting forever .
am i the only one that remembers
our horrible camping trip ?
it &apos;s &quot; suh @-@ mores . &quot; it &apos;s not &quot; s &apos;mores . &quot;
i just found out about it .
it &apos;s pronounced &quot; s &apos;mores . &quot;
yeah , it &apos;s a contraction of &quot; some mores . &quot;
so contract it .
stop saying &quot; suh @-@ mores &quot; unless you &quot; can not . &quot;
guys !
we need to stop fighting .
no , we don &apos;t .
it &apos;s good that we &apos;re finally getting all this out there .
after this , we &apos;ll stop fighting .
that &apos;s what we said
when we were painting shirley &apos;s nursery .
you were being racist .
hey , when i &apos;m being racist , you &apos;ll know .
guys , let &apos;s not repeat the events of caesar salad day .
troy , your nose is bleeding .
abed , stop being meta .
why do you always have to take whatever happens to us
and shove it up its own ass ?
he &apos;s not being meta .
he &apos;s just pointing out what none of us want to acknowledge--
it &apos;s all of us .
this group is toxic .
we fight about fighting about fighting .
we &apos;re sick .
i hate us !
well , what do we do now ?
well , we could do what we always do--
storm out in a huff and say that the group is breaking up .
troy , pass me that paintbrush , please .
does anybody have any iodine ?
how many vents are you gonna crawl out of this year ?
that &apos;s it . we &apos;re done .
yeah . we &apos;re done .
see you all tomorrow .
uh , you guys , wait . i want to say something .
you don &apos;t have to save us with a speech .
we &apos;re not breaking up ,
so we don &apos;t need to get back together .
i know i don &apos;t have to , but i want to .
look , we &apos;ve known each other for almost two years now .
and , yeah , in that time ,
i &apos;ve given a lot of speeches ,
but they all have one thing in common .
they &apos;re all different .
these drug runners aren &apos;t gonna execute pierce
because he &apos;s racist .
it &apos;s a locomotive that runs on us .
and the only sharks in that water
are the emotional ghosts that i like to call fear .
anchovies . fear .
and the dangers of ingesting mercury .
because the real bugs aren &apos;t the ones in those beds .
and there &apos;s no such thing as a free caesar salad .
and even if there were ...
the cape still might find a second life on cable .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
that water is a lie !
harrison ford is irradiating our testicles
with microwave satellite transmissions !
so maybe we are caught in an endless cycle
of screwups and hurt feelings ,
but i choose to believe it &apos;s just the universe &apos;s way
of molding us into some kind of supergroup .
like the traveling wilburys .
yes , troy , like the traveling wilburys of pain--
prepared for any insane adventure life throws our way .
and i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i &apos;m looking forward to every one of them .
oh , jeffrey .
oh , jeff .
jeffrey , jeffrey .
well , i guess we can get through anything .
so it &apos;s probably okay
if you and britta want to keep , you know , hooking up .
i don &apos;t mind it so much .
i &apos;m cool with it .
god cares .
whatever .
have fun tonight .
so ...
i guess we don &apos;t have to keep sneaking around anymore .
yeah , i guess not .
you want to stop doing this ?
yeah , yeah .
yeah .
it &apos;s not you , it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s you .
hey , guys .
hey , guys . ooh .
hey , you guys remember the time--
those guys don &apos;t care who they hurt , do they ?
you know i still don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m in the group ?
you and i have had some pretty good times , huh ?
what a year .
hey , everybody .
can i help you with anything ? i care about you guys .
shut up , dean . you dress in stupid outfits .
well , you have a right to your opinion ,
so i &apos;ll just leave .
you could have been nicer to the dean just then , jeff .
so what ? i don &apos;t care .
i just think there maybe could be repercussions , yo .
i don &apos;t care what you think .
i don &apos;t care about repercussions .
and i don &apos;t care about the dean .
okay .
meanwhile , at that same moment ,
a truck full of toxic waste crashes
and spills on the dean ,
transforming him into mega @-@ dean !
i don &apos;t care about anything .
wait . i care now ! now i care !
too late .
i owe you guys an apology .
the dean runs our school .
he &apos;s entitled to a modicum of respect .
you &apos;re always so mean to him . why ?
it &apos;s embarrassing to admit ,
but sometimes i felt jealous of his interesting outfits .
jeffrey , if i didn &apos;t know better ,
i &apos;d say you had a crush on him .
i &apos;ll never tell !
