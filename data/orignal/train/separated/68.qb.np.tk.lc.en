... to trial for a crime punishable by imprisonment
unless the initial charge has been brought by indictment of a grand jury .
and that &apos;s where you come in .
you are 16 citizens who have been given an immense responsibility .
you must decide a man &apos;s fate .
my name is wendy scott @-@ carr ,
and this is deputy state &apos;s attorney cary agos
and asa dana lodge .
we are the prosecution .
unlike a trial , there is no defense .
you will only hear our case .
it is up to us to convince you
that there &apos;s probable cause to bring william paul gardner to trial .
sorry . thanks for waiting .
is everything all right ?
uh , no . i wanted to talk to you
before i broke this to the equity partners and associates .
is this about will ?
yes . a grand jury has been impaneled ,
and our expectation is he will be indicted within the next two days .
i ...
what &apos;s the charge ?
judicial bribery .
of course , it &apos;s not true .
but the , uh ...
the state &apos;s attorney
believes that will arranged bets between judges
and bookies at his wednesday night basketball game .
i ...
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know it was that serious .
it is .
felony bribery-- three to seven years .
i &apos;m sorry , i really should go .
is it wendy scott @-@ carr or peter ?
uh , both , i should think .
peter has put wendy scott @-@ carr in charge of the prosecution .
what can i do ?
i don &apos;t want you to feel responsible
or obligated to do anything .
i mean , &quot; responsible &quot; is the wrong word .
we &apos;ve never considered you an ...
extension of the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
and you &apos;ve never acted like one . so ...
again , i leave it to you .
oh , alicia , hi .
would you like me to help mr. gold today ?
yes .
is there anything that you need help with ?
nope .
thank you .
alicia .
i just ... i have to rush off .
what &apos;s wrong ? what do you need ?
no , nothing . it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s about jackie ,
but we can talk about it later .
oh , well , 8 : 00 tonight ?
sure . great .
&apos;kay .
i &apos;m sorry .
no . why ? i am .
i didn &apos;t tell you because i didn &apos;t want this to become ...
you do not need to explain .
this is legal . it &apos;s not personal .
if i told you , it would become per ...
will , i &apos;m a lawyer .
i &apos;m a third @-@ year associate in your firm .
so use me .
ms. tascioni ,
hello .
hello again .
we seem to meet under a lot of circumstances like these .
we do .
i want to help .
okay .
with what ?
with what i know about the state &apos;s attorney .
i was hired as an investigator by the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
and in this capacity ,
did you come to review mr. gardner &apos;s cases ?
i did . and ...
i was surprised by how many cases , both civil and criminal ,
in which he achieved a successful verdict .
could you elaborate ?
on average , you would expect a 60 % win rate as a ceiling .
and what did you find with mr. gardner &apos;s cases ?
he had 75 % wins .
did you find anything suspicious
with regards to which judges
decided favorably for mr. gardner ?
yeah . three judges decided favorably for mr. gardner 95 % of the time .
they were judge winter , judge dunaway and parks .
and what else did you discover about these three judges ?
they all played regularly in a pickup basketball game
on wednesday nights , run by will gardner .
thank you , mr. wiley .
okay , so the strategy is this .
hello , ms. lockhart .
hello .
you &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re up next .
i know . thank you .
how did the partners take it ?
they were concerned .
we &apos;ll work the phones this afternoon to hand @-@ hold clients .
how are things here ?
uh , we were just ... going over strategy .
mrs. florrick .
you can join us .
yes .
okay , so here &apos;s the thing .
grand juries indict ; that &apos;s what they do ,
hamburgers and all .
ham sandwiches .
yes .
so , you &apos;re gonna get indicted , unless--
i like that pen .
thank you .
unless someone pulls the plug .
someone higher .
the state &apos;s attorney .
yes . you have an audience of one in there , ms. lockhart .
who ?
cary agos .
he defers to the state &apos;s attorney .
wendy scott @-@ carr does not .
she &apos;s ...
no , that &apos;s right ; she &apos;s her own person .
so you need to keep bringing the testimony back to peter florrick .
that &apos;ll get cary talking to peter .
that &apos;s right . if you want to stop this
at the grand jury stage ,
you need to get the state &apos;s attorney to stop it ,
and he &apos;ll only stop it if it looks like it &apos;ll hurt him .
you see ?
yes . good .
excuse me .
hello , eli .
hello , alicia .
would you like to guess what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
i &apos;m not there ?
yes . i ask for alicia ;
i get alicia lite .
this is glac , alicia , glac--
the gay and lesbian alliance of chicago .
they need someone to campaign
against the defense of marriage act .
i needed you .
why me ?
because you ...
because you &apos;re a gay icon .
excuse me ?
i didn &apos;t decide it .
where are you getting this ?
the gay blogosphere .
you &apos;re one of those spurned wives .
oh , dear lord .
your suffering has made you iconic .
they have a lot of money to fight doma .
this means a lot of money .
eli , as much as it would gratify me
to sit beside you signing autographs ,
you are the one they want
you don &apos;t need window @-@ dressing .
oh , yes , alicia , give me a pep talk .
caitlin is capable . she &apos;s smart .
she &apos;s studious . she &apos;s david lee &apos;s niece ,
and that means something to spencer roth .
she &apos;s what ?
david lee &apos;s niece
david lee &apos;s niece . the divorce attorney ?
yeah , family law . why ?
i &apos;ll be waiting by the phone !
you and i need to talk , alicia .
don &apos;t make me wait . don &apos;t you dare . it &apos;ll get ugly .
eli !
stacie .
it &apos;s so good to see you !
and you .
we &apos;re up for all the same jobs , aren &apos;t we ?
we should be friends .
we shouldn &apos;t be enemies .
the best of friends .
so , the defense of marriage act ,
what &apos;s your pitch on that ?
it &apos;s wrong .
i want to learn from you , eli .
there &apos;s so much i can learn .
i want to have lunch .
let &apos;s do .
no .
not lunch . drinks .
hot drinks .
there are these drinks-- mulled wine with brandy .
they &apos;re amazing .
sounds good .
i &apos;m gonna call you .
gay and lesbian alliance of chicago .
how may i connect you ?
hello . this is stacie hall &apos;s assistant .
i &apos;m having trouble texting her .
could you get her an immediate message ?
i know she &apos;s in a meeting with spencer roth .
sure . what is it ?
could you tell her that her 11 : 00 meeting with rush
has moved to noon .
with rush ?
yes . limbaugh .
do you want me to spell that for you ?
no , i think i &apos;ve got it .
you and mr. gardner have known each other for ...
how many years ?
eight years .
and you were originally partners in opposing firms ?
yes .
and you knew about
his troubles at his first baltimore firm ?
i &apos;ll need more clarity
in order to answer that question .
my apologies .
you knew that he took $ 45,000
from a client &apos;s account to pay off a gambling debt ?
all i knew is what i heard from you
when you questioned me in my office , ms. scott @-@ carr ,
and that peter florrick ,
the state &apos;s attorney , doesn &apos;t feel there &apos;s enough
evidence there to prosecute him .
i can understand your defensiveness .
really ? i didn &apos;t think i was being defensive ,
i thought i was being clear .
then let &apos;s continue to be clear .
have you ever been to one of mr. gardner &apos;s pickup games ?
no .
why not ?
i don &apos;t play basketball .
has he asked you to go ?
uh , yes .
and why did he ask you to go
if you didn &apos;t play basketball ?
he said it was a good place ,
to meet judges and prosecutors who matter .
for example , peter florrick ,
the current state &apos;s attorney , often participated in the pickup games .
but you decided not to go to these games .
now , wasn &apos;t that because you thought there was something
corrupt about these relationships ?
no . oddly , it was because
i didn &apos;t play basketball .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything wrong
for judges and lawyers to unwind over sports .
and my guess is that the current state &apos;s attorney
doesn &apos;t think so either , or he wouldn &apos;t participate .
what &apos;s she doing ?
tying peter to it .
let &apos;s talk about one particular lawsuit--
the mcdermott case .
now , this was a lawsuit brought by a family
whose child died from eating food tainted with peanut oil .
yes .
and this was a client
you brought into the firm .
yes .
but will gardner requested to take it over from you .
yes .
why ?
he thought he would be better .
but it was only after a change of courts ,
after judge parks had taken over the case ,
that will requested this switch ?
take your time , ms. lockhart .
yes .
and didn &apos;t you explain this switch to your associates
as being due to the fact that
mr. gardner had a better relationship with judge parks ?
yes .
how did it go ?
will , do you have a moment ?
why did we win the mcdermott case ?
they asked you about the mcdermott case ?
they asked me almost exclusively about the mcdermott case .
why did we win it ?
it was a good case .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
we argued it well .
you argued it well .
i wasn &apos;t there .
then i argued it well .
they asked me questions
about my conversations with the associates .
how would they know that ?
you and i should talk .
i don &apos;t want to see alicia prosecuted either .
i need more .
the mcdermott file doesn &apos;t connect the dots .
it &apos;s not me . it &apos;s wendy .
give me more , and we &apos;ll tear it up .
the rider evidence that can hurt alicia ?
we &apos;ll tear it up .
you got to smile .
i got to smile ?
yes , &apos; cause the grand jury will perceive your attitude as hostile if it &apos;s ...
hostile .
please ?
since you said &quot; please . &quot;
so , we were worried about the mcdermott case ,
and here we are ,
dealing with questions about the mcdermott case .
yes , we were just discussing that .
and their questions would suggest
some deeper familiarity , as if someone were ...
talking to them .
i &apos;m gonna check into it .
good .
she &apos;s great .
yeah .
please stay on the line
and your call will be answered ...
mr. gold ?
here are your xeroxes .
oh , good . thanks .
and could you get a few things from downstairs ?
here &apos;s a list .
um , sure , definitely .
i will be right back .
good .
sooner , the better .
and hello , alicia .
hello .
getting close to caitlin , are we ?
yes . she &apos;s a real go @-@ getter .
not a moment of complaint .
she made these copies for you ?
yup . very important stuff .
these are from last year .
yes .
and who knows when i may need them again .
so , who are we acting out against , eli ? david lee ?
me ? the concept of first @-@ year associates ?
might there be a simpler explanation ?
i need someone to free me up so i can ... work .
there are paralegals for that .
i like caitlin .
you wanted to talk ?
yes , about attitudes , and let &apos;s start with yours .
alicia ?
i outrank you .
i am an equity partner , you &apos;re a third @-@ year associate .
and i feel--
and yes , you are making me resort to marriage counseling speak--
i feel that you &apos;re treating me
with the same degree of disregard
as when i was your husband &apos;s campaign strategist ,
and i think that is wrong .
not kill @-@ a @-@ puppy wrong , but wrong , as in incorrect .
working off old information .
and i think we all need
to reevaluate our working relationship here .
you &apos;re right .
what do you need ?
i need you to help me with my pitch .
spencer roth has asked us in
to pitch to all of glac on wednesday .
okay . let &apos;s get going .
no .
i &apos;m sorry . i think i interrupted you .
you said in an interview in chicago magazine ,
quote , &quot; what i love about will gardner is he is as sneaky
as i am , &quot; end quote .
do you still believe that ?
i think i meant &quot; sneakily charming . &quot;
so , that &apos;s why the next line reads :
&quot; the sneaky thing is to cross that ethical line
and not lose track of your client . &quot;
is that what you meant ?
uh ... something like that .
you did contract work for judge parks , didn &apos;t you ?
i did .
his wife was ill ,
and you helped him with the will and his children &apos;s trust ?
if by &quot; helped &quot; you mean he paid me , yes .
but he paid you less than what was usual for this type of work ?
no , he paid what was fair ,
considering the will and trust
were simpler than most .
who brought judge parks to you as a client ?
wasn &apos;t it will gardner ?
that &apos;s probably right .
and wasn &apos;t the work a payoff for judge parks
deciding the mcdermott case for you ?
it &apos;s an odd payoff , to charge him for work i did .
isn &apos;t that a conflict of interest , sir ?
no more than the trust work i did for peter florrick ,
the current state &apos;s attorney .
please answer the question , mr. lee .
oh , i thought i was , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m making an honest comparison
to other work i did for your boss , peter florrick--
trust work for which i charged even less than judge parks .
if this is a conflict of interest ... isn &apos;t that ?
that &apos;s how a pro does it .
you &apos;re welcome .
what did they ask ?
you and judge parks .
everything was you and judge parks .
daddy &apos;s a balloon .
where &apos;s the pin ?
oh , hey , there . i &apos;m sorry .
um , i was wondering if you might know
where there was a restroom that had a changing table ?
oh , my goodness , look at that face .
yeah , she &apos;s waking up .
are you gonna go to the park ?
i have a sweet tooth .
yeah , i can see that .
does it taste better with whipped cream ?
is there anything that doesn &apos;t taste better with whipped cream ?
tell me when .
when . when .
to eli and stacie , new friends .
hmm . it &apos;s very , very sweet .
mmm , wait till you get to the bottom .
so , rush limbaugh , huh ?
yeah .
how do you explain that one ?
mm . i was meeting him to argue against doma .
nice . and they believed you ?
oh , i &apos;m convincing when i have to be .
mmm . fish . it burns .
fish ?
oh , i &apos;m trying not to swear .
everybody swears these days . have you noticed ?
old ladies , young girls .
really , everybody .
i have to tell you something .
okay .
all right .
but i have to steel myself first .
i desire you .
i &apos;m serious .
i desire you , eli .
every part of you .
your eyes ,
your hair .
i want to take you right now , right here
on the floor of this bar .
well , go ahead .
i &apos;m serious .
i know you are .
make the first move .
right here .
i &apos;m ready .
you .
no , you &apos;re the one who desires me .
i &apos;m pliable .
so ...
ply me .
it &apos;s sun tzu , hmm ?
destabilizing your enemy ?
you know the only problem with sun tzu ?
he never fought the jews .
we &apos;re masada , baby .
we don &apos;t mess around with mind games .
we use knives .
you &apos;re jewish ?
you &apos;re a nice girl .
with your sweet little drinks and your giggle ,
but you &apos;re not playing in the little leagues anymore .
put out your hand .
why ?
put it out .
and this is supposed to what ?
okay , this is ... this is lacking subtlety .
no , tell me about masada .
960 dead ?
all those big , strong jewish warriors ?
i &apos;ll talk to jackie .
good , thank you .
i just don &apos;t want things turning sour .
they won &apos;t . they won &apos;t .
how are things here ?
good .
work is hard ,
of course , because of this grand jury investigation .
what &apos;s going on , peter ?
i don &apos;t think we can have this conversation .
actually , we need to have this conversation .
it has nothing to do with us .
peter , how can it not ?
because i won &apos;t let it ;
that &apos;s why i chose wendy scott @-@ carr ,
so that it wouldn &apos;t .
she &apos;s making it worse .
no , she isn &apos;t .
she &apos;s not me ; i don &apos;t control her .
but that &apos;s the problem , peter .
it keeps your hands clean at the expense of ...
at the expense of who ?
will ?
no , my firm .
and will .
yes , my boss .
the boss who you &apos;re sleeping with ?
peter , if that &apos;s the issue here ,
then let &apos;s talk about that .
of course that &apos;s the issue !
there &apos;s nothing between us .
my god , you have changed .
i used to be able to tell when you lied .
you think i &apos;m lying ?
i think you &apos;re manipulating the truth like a pro .
well , you would know about pros .
well , you got me there .
what do you want , alicia ?
i want you to stop this grand jury .
no .
that &apos;s what i used to do .
things that worked , but were wrong .
not doing that anymore .
peter , your ...
problem wasn &apos;t that you did things that were wrong .
your problem was that you did things that were wrong against your family .
that may be so , but that has nothing to do with this .
will gardner is not my family .
good night .
please state your name for the record ?
robert parks .
i &apos;m a presiding justice in cook county &apos;s third municipal district .
thank you , sir .
your honor .
thank you , your honor .
is it fair to say that you are
a reluctant witness here today , your honor ?
it is fair to say that i believe this is a witch hunt .
and i think you &apos;re trying to criminalize behavior
that is far from criminal .
and what behavior is that ?
friendship and acquaintances between justices and attorneys outside work .
did the attorney , will gardner , ever offer you a bribe , your honor ?
upon the advice of counsel , i am here today to assert my right
under the fifth amendment against self @-@ incrimination .
did you ever make a illegal bets through will gardner
with the bookie jonathan meade ?
upon the advice of counsel , my answer to this question and all your questions
will be to assert my right under the fifth amendment against self @-@ incrimination .
i understand , your honor .
you don &apos;t understand a thing .
you &apos;re attempting to suggest that
there is something nefarious here , when you know for a fact
that any judge you haul in here would take the fifth .
excuse me , your honor ?
you either take the fifth ,
or you leave yourself open to questions .
did you meet with will gardner yesterday ?
upon the advice of counsel ,
i continue to assert my rights under the fifth amendment .
is this a photo of you meeting with will gardner yesterday ?
upon the advice of counsel , i insist on my fifth amendment rights .
you setting me up ?
excuse me , your honor ?
they have a photo , from yesterday .
you brought them to me .
you go down , you &apos;re not taking me .
okay , i can see there is some kind of strategy going on here .
we can &apos;t say .
i just want to know one thing .
is it illegal ?
no .
good .
you two behave now .
yeah ?
i just wanted to see how you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m good .
up next . probably another 30 minutes .
are you ... ?
i &apos;m fine .
no , are you taking the fifth ?
i don &apos;t know .
elsbeth thinks i should .
it &apos;s the smart move .
will ... i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
i am .
well , then be sorry because it &apos;s happening .
don &apos;t be sorry because of anything else .
okay . do good .
always .
well , well , it &apos;s family law , darkening my halls .
nora , could you ask caitlin to come in here , please ?
something fell off my desk .
so ...
so ...
caitlin &apos;s not cleaning this up .
oh , yes , she is .
it &apos;s such a double @-@ edged sword , isn &apos;t it ?
nepotism gets you the job , but then you catch all the poop
your uncle should .
&quot; poop &quot; ?
i &apos;m trying not to swear so much .
how &apos;s the campaign going for peter florrick ?
i hope well .
because his wife and i have been chatting .
as her divorce lawyer ,
of course , attorney @-@ client privilege applies ,
and i can &apos;t really share anything ,
but , uh , i hope the campaign is going well .
yes , mr. gold ?
oh , hi .
hi , caitlin . how are you ?
good . uh , what was it you needed ?
no , nothing . eli &apos;s fine .
okay .
well , give a call if you need anything .
and i have your xeroxes .
thanks , caitlin .
there &apos;s not much i love in life . i like money .
i don &apos;t love money .
is this going to be long ?
but i do love my niece .
she is all that is good in the world .
and i think you ought to clean that up .
good afternoon , mr. gardner .
ms. scott @-@ carr .
shall we start from the beginning here ?
did you meet with judge parks yesterday ?
yes , i did meet with judge parks yesterday .
i see . um , thank you , sir .
and thank you for not taking the fifth .
you &apos;re welcome .
this is you in this picture ?
yes .
and what is in this envelope
you handed to judge parks ?
money .
okay .
and , um , was there an agreement
between you and judge parks based on the exchange of this cash ?
yes .
and what was that ?
that he would give it to unicef
for their immunization drive in uganda .
uh , and , um , how @-@ how much money did you give him ?
$ 2,000 .
for unicef ?
i mean , isn &apos;t that
a lot of money to be giving to unicef ?
it is .
and why did you give him all that ?
because i think kids in uganda should be immunized .
and isn &apos;t this just a little bit suspicious
that you gave this money on the eve
of your testifying here ?
i don &apos;t know . i hadn &apos;t thought of it .
and why should we trust you
that this money was , in fact , for unicef ?
because i have a receipt .
okay . let &apos;s see .
i have some notes here from ...
thank you .
this is a copy of an e @-@ mail from you to judge parks ,
exchanging information about which settlement
would be agreeable to your client .
really ? where did you get it ?
when i am the subject of a grand jury investigation , mr. gardner ,
you may ask me that .
are these e @-@ mails from you to judge parks ?
no .
could you read there ?
to whom are these e @-@ mails addressed ?
it says , &quot; judge parks , &quot;
but i never sent these to him .
someone must &apos;ve typed over the real addressee .
and why would someone do that ?
i have no idea , you just handed it to me ,
but the original e @-@ mails ...
... are here .
let &apos;s turn now to judge parks .
but don &apos;t you want to know who the e @-@ mails were really addressed to ?
no , that &apos;s not necessary .
they were addressed to my partner , diane lockhart .
excuse me , mr. gardner ?
and it seemed only natural to discuss the award amount .
mr. gardner , that was not my question .
please strike that from the record !
you fooled me ?
yeah .
go ahead .
what ?
hit me .
it &apos;ll make you feel better .
okay , thank you . thank you for that .
i owe you .
no , you don &apos;t .
okay , you two , it &apos;s not over yet .
she promised a new subpoena .
what i &apos;m worried is she ...
it &apos;s not kalinda ...
but she &apos;s angry now .
so she goes where ?
the whole firm ?
personal . she ...
you &apos;re vulnerable somewhere , right ?
you gave her the mcdermott case as some big fat juicy ...
bait , right ?
so she wouldn &apos;t go after your real vulnerability ?
yes .
so ...
who would she subpoena now ?
any word on mr. gardner ?
not yet .
did i do something wrong ?
did you ... ?
do you know why mr. gold is being so cold to me now ?
oh , i didn &apos;t think he was .
i thought he was overworking you .
no . he &apos;s not even talking to me now .
did i do something wrong ?
no . i wouldn &apos;t worry .
he seems distracted .
i wanted to tell him something about the meeting ,
but he won &apos;t listen .
what ?
yeah , what do you need ?
well , i &apos;m in bed , thinking of you .
no , you &apos;re not .
you know my meeting &apos;s in five minutes ,
and you &apos;re trying to throw me off my game .
well , that &apos;s true , but i &apos;m still thinking of you .
of course , you are . do you hear my voice ?
i am not thrown .
well , you shouldn &apos;t have wimped out last night , eli .
you &apos;d be right here in my bed with me .
i gotta go now , ms. hall , and kick your ass .
but it &apos;s been nice talking to you .
eli , sorry to keep you waiting .
spencer , no trouble .
remember mrs. florrick ?
i promised i &apos;d drag her along .
yes , hello , alicia .
that &apos;s a beautiful suit .
oh , thank you . um ,
do you mind if we just take one second ?
no problem . i &apos;ll be right back .
what the heck ?
tell him , caitlin .
i &apos;m sorry . i wanted to get to you earlier .
this is not about the defense of marriage act , eli .
i was studying up on this meeting ,
and one thing that didn &apos;t make sense
is why glac needed a crisis manager
to fight against the defense of marriage act
when , in fact , the national committee was handling it .
and then i was reading some gay blogs ...
can we talk about this after the meeting ?
eli , this is the meeting .
spencer roth wrote a letter
in support of the proposed at &amp; t merger
with t @-@ mobile as acting head of glac .
at &amp; t supposedly gave glac a $ 60,000 grant .
when was this ?
last week .
this isn &apos;t about the defense of marriage act .
this is about damage control .
the glac board doesn &apos;t want to be criticized
for its involvement in this merger .
but why say it &apos;s about the defense of marriage ?
because they don &apos;t want to make it public
they &apos;re shopping for crisis managers .
we have to change the pitch right now .
attacking the glac board is attacking gays .
eli .
too cynical ?
thank caitlin .
thank you .
uh @-@ oh . this is about will .
i &apos;ll catch up .
hello .
i don &apos;t understand .
i know .
i thought wendy scott @-@ carr
was targeting the mcdermott case .
i never worked on that .
i know .
so ... why ?
well , she &apos;ll probably push you on things
mr. gardner did that she
could paint as legally questionable .
a prosecutor can ask anything at a grand jury hearing .
so what do you know that could hurt him ?
alicia florrick .
f @-@ l @-@ o @-@ r @-@ r @-@ i @-@ c @-@ k .
the same spelling as my husband peter , the state &apos;s attorney .
thank you .
for the sake of disclosure ,
have we met before ?
yes , last year , during the state &apos;s attorney election .
i believe you lost to my husband .

two and a half years .

will gardner .
you were friends in college ?
yes , at georgetown .
how long had it been since you &apos;d last practiced law ?
13 years .
i took time off to raise my children .
a 13 @-@ year layoff .
that was quite generous of mr. gardner .
have you ever seen mr. gardner do anything that you &apos;d consider illegal ?
not that i recall .
since joining his firm , at any time ,
have you been engaged in a sexual relationship with mr. gardner ?
i don &apos;t see how that &apos;s relevant .
the jury is entitled
to know the true nature of your relationship with him .
this line of questioning is inappropriate .
the jury needs to know she has an incentive to protect him .
you asked me what i thought about their relationship ,
and i told you ... in confidence .
if you &apos;re not comfortable , mr. agos ,
you are free to step out .
mrs. florrick , one more time .
while working at his firm , at any time ,
have you and will gardner engaged
in a sexual relationship ?
yes .
is this sexual relationship still active ?
no .
when did this relationship begin ?
in the spring .
and when did it end ?
a few months ago .
during the course of this relationship with mr. gardner ,
was your office moved to the 28th floor ,
the same floor as the senior partners &apos; ?
yes .
and in that time , had you been advised
that you were on a track to make partner ?
mrs. florrick , would you please take your seat ?
no .
i need to ask you to sit .
no . thank you .
the witness has not been excused !
you are out of control .
mrs. florrick , if you do not sit back down ,
i will have you held in contempt .
fine . arrest me .
mrs. florrick ?
hi . you zipped out of there .
i didn &apos;t get a chance to do a postmortem .
the transcript of the hearing-- it &apos;ll be released to the public ?
only if mr. gardner &apos;s indicted .
otherwise , it stays sealed .
what happened in there ?
i &apos;ve got to talk to my kids .
you &apos;re so funny .
you &apos;re so spontaneous .
like a youth in may . say when .
keep going . keep ... yeah , that &apos;s perfect .
so , what &apos;s the surprise ?
you called saying you had a surprise ?
yes , um ...
the surprise is ...
i desire you , too .
oh , now you &apos;re just trying to throw me off my game ?
i am , but i still desire you .
really ? okay ? well , then let &apos;s go do something about it .
my apartment &apos;s 15 minutes away .
mine &apos;s ten . you &apos;re playing chicken .
i am , and i &apos;m good at it .
mm . you don &apos;t see me swerving off the road .
then don &apos;t .
we &apos;re gonna crash .
unless you swerve .
i got the glac account .
oh , what &apos;s happened ?
where &apos;s that desire ?
i don &apos;t believe you .
you were expecting a call from glac about an hour ago .
you didn &apos;t get it .
i did .
oh , fish .
i still desire you , stacie .
the way a victor desires his spoils .
that &apos;s right .
get those tiny little wheels turning in your head .
&quot; which way should i play this ?
contrite and compliant , or tough and brash ? &quot;
okay . let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s have intercourse .
ladies and gentlemen of the grand jury ,
the hour has grown late .
if there are no further questions ,
the people of illinois ask that you vote a true bill
to indict mr. gardner on the charges of conspiracy to commit bribery
and interfering with a judicial officer ,
class three and class two felonies .
please signify by raising your hands .
i &apos;ve got a question ?
excuse me ?
you said , if there are no further questions .
i have a question .
yes . i &apos;m sorry , please .
who is this peter everyone was talking about ?
that would be peter florrick , the state &apos;s attorney .
he hired ms. scott @-@ carr
to conduct this investigation .
uh @-@ huh , okay .
so then , isn &apos;t it weird to bring in his wife ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
by law , we are permitted to only answer questions
about the facts of the case ,
but if you &apos;re asking ...
i mean , who cares who she sleeps with ?
if she &apos;s getting some , great .
here &apos;s what i don &apos;t get .
why even go after will gardner ?
why not that judge guy ?
well , again , by law , we are not permitted ..
i mean , at least will gardner answered the questions
the judge just kept taking the fifth .
i know .
i didn &apos;t get that , eith .
maybe this judge knows peter florrick .
maybe they should both be arrested ...
you know what ? that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s not ...
i think florrick and the judge are in it together .
yeah , yeah , why don &apos;t you bring in that guy ?
that was some good fishing
hey , um , m , could you grab my robe for me , please ?
oh , yeah . hey , what do you think of that ?
i mean , it &apos;s just a mock @-@ up .
i told vanessa a deeper blue border
would really make it pop .
you &apos;re working on my ex @-@ wife &apos;s campaign ?
only &apos; cause she asked me .
she threw me a lot of business in d.c.
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . to see this ?
eli , i desire you .
you &apos;re home early .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i just ... um ...
i want to talk to you .
what did we do ?
you didn &apos;t do anything . it ...
god , paranoid ...
you were thinking the same thing .
hello ?
hi . it &apos;s kalinda .
i know . what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
no bill .
what ? i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t understand .
they didn &apos;t indict a ham sandwich .
you &apos;re kidding ?
no . will is free .
how is that possible ?
um , we don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re still trying to figure that out .
you should come on down here . we &apos;re having a party .
oh , um , no . thanks , though .
and ... kalinda , th ... thank you for calling .
no problem .
come on , let &apos;s dance .
oh , no , i don &apos;t dance .
no , i have to drink a lot to dance ,
and i don &apos;t like to drink a lot , no .
well , this is the one exception . come on .
no , no . seriously , you do it .
that was a close one .
yes .
let &apos;s try and reduce the excitement level from now on , shall we ?
what is it , mom ?
nothing . just something at work .
was it good ?
yes ...
it is , oddly .
you wanted to talk to us ?
i did , didn &apos;t i ?
i haven &apos;t been the best of moms .
mom .
how ?
i want to change all that .
i , um ...
i think i should take a week off work ,
and we should go on vacation .
ms. scott @-@ carr .
i wanted to thank you for your service .
you &apos;re excused .
peter , we can still indict will gardner .
with the next grand jury , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll take ... no .
no .
we &apos;re done .
there are other ways .
like calling my wife ?
it was a strategic move .
thank you for your service .
my assistant will validate your parking .
i &apos;m sending these infractions of mr. gardner &apos;s to the bar association .
if you won &apos;t pursue him , they will .
do what you got to do .
now get out of my office .
