look at this .
the house sang out to us of miami and taormina
where we had our honeymoon
nicole said , &quot; let &apos;s buy it . &quot;
can just about smell the salt .
you mean the painting or the view ?
both .
that &apos;s called the trumpay la oil .
fool the eye .
it was done by an artist right here in west hempstead .
i &apos;ll be damned .
follow me , jerry .
this little bitch is for you .
it &apos;s a whirlpool duet ,
top of the line.same as mine
nicole is head over heels with it.this is above and beyond , carmine .
thank my father too , may he rest in peace .
this is for freeport . it &apos;s a token .
you know it &apos;s my understanding , carmine , that johnny is still sore about that .
that &apos;s why i appreciate your support .
i &apos;m moved up here now.you and me are gonna do great things together .
daddy , daddy ! the boat is sinking !
carmine ! my god !
i just sailed her up from miami three weeks ago . she was fine .
you should call the coastguard , carmine .
oh , shit !
it &apos;s ok , take it easy .
after all these years of marriage ,
you know what you find yourself thinking in your private moments ?
please , god , let me die first.i don &apos;t wanna miss him .
he &apos;s gonna be all right .
you &apos;re lucky .
in some way , you &apos;ve been spared that .
well , you and tony calling it quits now .
maybe we should cancel the party .
maybe he &apos;ll be fine by his birthday .
you know he &apos;s turning 75 , ma , that &apos;s a milestone .
he &apos;s got some bruising . he &apos;s very lucky .
those hedges broke his fall . but a few days of rest and he should be fine .
the neurologist is giving him a final look , then you can take him home .
thank you so much , doctor .
thank god .
his roofing days are over , i &apos;ll tell you that right now .
i guess .
so , what do you think about the party ?
jeez , ma , i ...
i think we should go for it .
well , what do you think about inviting tony ?
well , that &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t know if i should or not .
everybody would understand if you didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re separated .
i know .
just the idea of having a family party
in the backyard without tony manning the grill , playing host ...
it wouldn &apos;t be the same .
it &apos;s gonna be ok , baby .
why don &apos;t they take care of this man ?
i think it &apos;s a very wise decision .
what decision ? i haven &apos;t made one .
i thought i heard you say that you had.that he wasn &apos;t coming .
maserati .
kind of draws attention , no ?
true .
friends of ours , most of &apos; em probably wouldn &apos;t own it .
it was always a dream of mine to own a fine italian sports car .
salute .
and in the guinea grey it looks fantastic .
tops out 176 miles per hour .
standing quarter in 13 and change .
how many horses ?
390 .
what &apos;d that set you back ? about ...
99 and change .
you &apos;re spending like you &apos;re on the throne .
i had a good year .
oh , god bless .
while we &apos;re doing car talk here ,
phil ... madonna , he won &apos;t let that thing go .
he owed me money and he was ducking me .
i &apos;m not saying you &apos;re wrong.phil
treats nickels like manhole covers . believe me , i know .
the loyal captains need to know i stand behind them .
fucking little carmine .
this asshole &apos;s giving away washing machines . you believe that ?
he don &apos;t have collision insurance , fucking phil ?
his son @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s a broker.they let it lapse looking for a better rate .
fucking idiot .
tony , i ruled in your favour .
the racetrack , the money philly owed you .
if i &apos;m paying for it , we do it at pussy &apos;s or not at all .
his wife &apos;s running the body shop now.i can at least control expenses .
thanks .
come on . get in . i &apos;ll take you for a ride .
fucking thing &apos;s so powerful , i had to take a lesson from the dealer .
it &apos;s pretty low .
how &apos;s ginny like the car ?
she loves it .
she hasn &apos;t driven with me . with her knee ,
she has a little trouble getting into the seat .
tony , hi.hey , ange .
how are ya ?
good .
a friend of mine banged up his car pretty good
so i was thinking , maybe help us both out and throw a little business your way .
you didn &apos;t need to come . phone me .
the thing is , i gotta pay for the repairs .
long story , i distracted him while he was driving .
anyway , the point being that anything you can do to keep costs in line
would be a big help to me .
you look like you &apos;re doing pretty good since we had that phone call
where you asked me could you take over puss &apos;s body shop .
thank you for that , tony.you didn &apos;t have to say yes with all
the other kind of business you do through here .
his name is phil , and carmela sends her love .
please say hello !
finally . i left a message i was gonna come by .
well , i got in late .
the girl called in sick .
you should get a new one .
have a seat .
may i get you anything ?
how &apos;s your father ?
much better .
oh , thanks .
he &apos;ll be fine for the party , thank god .
well , that &apos;s good .
what party ?
his 75th birthday ?
the surprise party we talked about last summer ?
oh , yeah . that &apos;s coming up ?
next saturday .
but actually that &apos;s why i wanted to come by .
i think maybe it would be best ...
be easier anyway , for both of us , if ...
if ...
and not have you there .
my father would love to have you there .
he &apos;s crazy about your sausages and all the rest of it , but ...
i thought , &quot; why put us and people in an uncomfortable situation ? &quot;
i decided right away when we broke up i wasn &apos;t coming .
really ?
i &apos;m so glad you understand .
it was hard for me to come to this decision , let alone tell you .
well , i &apos;d like to contribute anyway.no , mom and i are taking care of it .
for hugh &apos;s 75th ? i insist .
i would rather see you go back to your therapist .
i &apos;d like to see you go to a therapist ! and i &apos;m not the only one .
oh , really ? you can tell them all i can &apos;t afford it .
it &apos;s not really your business any more whether i go or what !
i brought you some danish and coffee .
fucking medication .
i can &apos;t think . i can &apos;t stay awake .
it don &apos;t have that side effect .
but it &apos;ll help your outlook if
you &apos;d take it consistently like you &apos;re supposed to .
what &apos;s on ? it said in the guide it &apos;s an italian movie ,
but even with the captions i can &apos;t tell what &apos;s what .
they had jesus hanging off a helicopter ,
but you could tell it was a dummy .
you know who i saw at the bakery ?
how the fuck could i know ?
rosalie aprile .
there &apos;s a surprise party for carmela &apos;s father next week .
he &apos;s gonna be 75 .
you get an invite ?
no , but we go way back to when moses wore short pants .
i &apos;d better call hugh .
tell him not to expect me .
it &apos;s a surprise party , jun &apos; .what are we , children ?
at our age it &apos;s enough surprise we &apos;re still alive every morning .
what cities and states , please ?
in west orange .
deangelis , hugo .
the call can automatically be completed by pressing one
for an additional charge of 35 cents .
what the fuck ? it &apos;s over anyhow .
hello ?
who is this ?
corrado soprano .
corrado .
how are ya ?
how am i ? i &apos;m a prisoner in my own home is how i am .
what do we live for ?
yeah .
anyhow , i wanted to wish you a buona fortuna ,
and also send you my regrets .
i &apos;d love to be at your jubilee ...
junior .
jubilee ? - but the government says i can &apos;t leave the house ,
and my family keeps me sedated .
bobby told me it was a surprise party but i told him ... i go ,
&quot; at our age it &apos;s enough surprise every day when we get up in the morning . &quot;
i suppose so .
so happy birthday , my friend , and many more .
to think ,
when i got out of the joint they thought an air bag was paulie walnuts .
how &apos;d we do this week ?
good .
the acura dealer , what &apos;s his name , he took 20 units .
carlo gave me the ok to make some personnel changes at the warehouse .
your call .
i don &apos;t know . the air bag thing , it earns good .
it &apos;s not hard work , christ knows , but ...
but what ? i could be a lot more service in other areas
. and getting straightened out wouldn &apos;t hurt .
just eat what &apos;s on your plate right now .
christ , what &apos;s it been , a month ?
i &apos;m a team player , cousin . charlie hustle .
if that &apos;s what you want , i &apos;ll do it .
if you need some money ...
get the fuck out of here .
all right .
let &apos;s go get a drink .
what should i get hugh for his birthday ?
i was thinking cigars but i figured you were probably gonna bring some .
actually i decided not to go .
in light of the situation , i went , i saw carm ,
i told her i thought it &apos;d be best if i sit it out .
hi , phil , joe .
where &apos;s your brother @-@ in @-@ law , doll ?
i wouldn &apos;t know .
hey , philip , how the hell are you ?
how &apos;s the neck ?
where &apos;s the car ?
we all passed a lotta water since the old days , huh ?
i was away when all that shit went down with your brother .
what the fuck happened ?
we don &apos;t like to talk about it .
your car &apos;s in here , phil .
it &apos;s all set .
what the fuck is this ?
it was a front @-@ end collision , phil .
this new paint isn &apos;t as brilliant .
it &apos;s factory paint , same as original .
it is different . it &apos;s duller .
something &apos;s off with the seat .
what is it , phil ?
feels off kilter . try it , joey .
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s off its axis .
it reclines strange too . try it .
nobody said anything about the seats .
this is unacceptable .
come on , joey .
give me a call when you get the job done.a couple of days , phil .
we did what was asked of us .
call me when it &apos;s done right .
so , dad , how does dinner at vesuvio &apos;s sound for your birthday ?
just us . we &apos;ll come here first for the presents
and then we &apos;ll go over there .
sure , sure .
that sounds fine .
did somebody tell you something ?
i know all about it .
you can save the cloak and dagger .
aj !
aj !
what ? - junior soprano told me all about it .
that miserable fucking man .
you don &apos;t know the half .
relax . i &apos;m fine with knowing .
at my age , it &apos;s surprise enough to be able to get out of bed every morning .
so who &apos;s coming to this shindig ? god damn him !
all of us , your brother lester , dr fegoli .
russ fegoli ? he &apos;s in town ?
he retired from the foreign service .
but they were living out in marin county or wherever .
well , they settled on jersey .
octavia , the oldest , lives here .
wait , who &apos;s dr faggo ?
fegoli . feg .
she of the five @-@ page christmas card .
and on flag day , papa russ shook hands with andrew cuomo .
what an honour . b @-@ f @-@ d.
the fegoli kids finished college.that &apos;s what sticks in your craw .
when he got that medal ,
you two weren &apos;t even invited to the ceremony .
it was out in california !
they knew that your father doesn &apos;t like to be out of his element .
now , here &apos;s someone we can all be proud of , anthony .
dr fegoli served in the state department .
in rome , he was career assistant to the ambassador to the vatican .
he got a medal from the pope himself .
wow . - but when we were kids in
the navy , he had such a bad case of the crabs
we used to call him the governor of maryland .
stop acting like a child.lighten up . he &apos;s old enough .
she &apos;s right , knock it off .
who else is coming ?
freddy di novi ...
tony &apos;ll love him .
who else ?
dad , tony isn &apos;t coming to the party .
why ?
well , i felt that since we &apos;re separated ,
we should get used to the idea of living separate lives .
that &apos;s a crock of shit.don &apos;t talk to her like that .
i &apos;ve known the man for 20 @-@ something years !
it &apos;s his house !
tony is in agreement with me .
because you put the screws to him .
i &apos;ll cancel the party .
go ahead .
i &apos;m not coming if the man of the house isn &apos;t there .
tony , it &apos;s angie .
we did all the repairs you said on phil &apos;s car .
he came today and now he found a dent in the rear .
his seat . there &apos;s a problem with that .
his seat ?
i didn &apos;t wanna get into these extras without checking with you .
you wanna run a body shop , run a body shop .
you claimed your piece of the garage .
so you wanna be in business , do what you think the situation calls for .
i wanna put my kids through college.that &apos;s a good thing , ange .
some women left alone like that would &apos;ve given up .
tony , before i outlay for these costs , i need to know ...
ange , i &apos;m not there , what do i know ? it &apos;s your call .
tone . what &apos;s up ?
pussy &apos;s body shop is one of your stops , right ?
they &apos;re fixing the fucking shah of iran &apos;s car .

angelo &apos;s my buddy .
he knew the jackie gleason stuff by heart . he acted all the parts .

that &apos;s a different story !
get out ! get out !
so how &apos;s your re @-@ entry been ? you doing ok ?
yeah . tony &apos;s been good with me .
i always liked your cousin . - he &apos;s a real gentleman .
angelo &apos;s looking out for you too .
i told rusty that you might need a little earn .
yeah , i could use a little cash injection ,
maybe a push up the pyramid .
you know , time served ?
we need something done .
a nice little payday for you ,
and an opportunity for you to hone that rep you left behind .
and this involves ?
somebody needs to go .
anyone i know ?
new york guy , not jersey .
who is he with ?
friend of a friend.not a friend of ours .
a friend of johnny &apos;s .
you guys got to settle that shit . - it &apos;s not the boat .
it &apos;s not the boat .
it &apos;s lorraine calluzzo.rainey calluzzo .
little carmine went to school with her .
they go back that far .
kill a woman ? come on .
i can &apos;t sign on right now .
i wanna give my cousin the benefit of the doubt .
he don &apos;t want us involved in this problem over here anyway .
why don &apos;t you think about it for a bit ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t think so ,

the prosciutto @-@ wrapped chre . rosalie just took &apos; em out .
an italian allergic to pomodori ?
dio mio . you have my sympathies .
it wasn &apos;t always like this .
it started when they gave me radiation for my prostate .
don &apos;t ask me why .
did you know monsignor kelly ?
he was in charge of the tours at all the catacombs .
i made you a plate , russ .
thank you , mary .
you know , carmela &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law livia detested northern cooking .
really , why ?
she skeeved the butter .
the father was like that , too . the whole soprano bunch .
so many neapolitans and sicilians feel that way .
you really have to go to italy to know and so many of them don &apos;t .
i ate like a champ up and down the boot the whole two weeks .
but those recipes that you used to send me from tuscany , lena .
my god , they were a revelation .
bollito misto , osso bucco ...
the lovely carmela . would you like to say a few words ?
he &apos;s back , thank god . will you get the guests arriving ?
where the hell is tony ?
have a glass of wine , it &apos;ll calm you down .
he is bringing the charcoal and the sausage . always the last minute .
i heard that .
finally .
she &apos;s got no faith in me .
i wonder why ?
pins and needles , needles and pins .
palumbo &apos;s
the birthday boy &apos;s favourite.where is he ?
he &apos;s out back.oh , good .
honey , pace yourself .
hey , there he is !
hey , happy birthday to you got salsiccia for you
russ , wait till you taste this . there &apos;s nothing else like it .
i want you to meet a couple of our oldest friends ,
dr russ and lena fegoli.nice to meet you , sir .
my son @-@ in @-@ law ... well , whatever ... tony soprano .
a doctor , huh ?
that &apos;s good . somebody usually goes down at these .
he &apos;s just joking .
unfortunately , my doctorate is in international affairs .
from princeton .
gi bill .
so you &apos;re a doctor like ... kissinger &apos;s a doctor .
yes .
russ had an audience with four popes .
what section did you all sit in ?
idiot !
tb , make sure you shoot the food tables before they &apos;re pillaged .
well , i &apos;d love to stay and chat but i got a fire to start .
nice to meet you , doc .
nice to meet you .
everybody !
could you gather around , please ?
everybody , everybody !
come on over .
i would like to make a toast to the man of the hour ,
a very special man ,
a man who i love more than words could possibly say ...
my father .
hear , hear !
you are the best father and grandfather in the world .
speech , speech !
you are the greatest , my little melly .
thank you for everything .
tony ,
thank you for having us at your home .
mare , my lovely bride .
still the prettiest girl in the world .
thank you for putting up with me all these years .
thank all you freeloaders for coming !
why don &apos;t you open up your gifts , dad ?
not now , carmela.- it &apos;s very mercenary .
well , good .
people spent money on them .
i &apos;ll break the ice .
here .
open this one .
it &apos;s from him .
you &apos;re too much .
a stratocaster ?
a beretta .
it &apos;s a shotgun .
this is ... i don &apos;t know what to say .
it &apos;s a giubileo 12 @-@ gauge . 28 @-@ inch barrel .
nice to have money .
get me another rolling rock , jay .
what time did you start drinking today ?
probably right after you got up .
coz !
tony , can you bring the camera over here and get a shot of this ?
sure , i got nothing better to do .
i expect a freezer full of venison this year .
you got it , kid .
beautiful piece . the over @-@ under action , the engraving , they &apos;re artisans .
and you know , i &apos;ve been to the beretta studio in brescia .
no kidding . i &apos;d love to see that .
you know , that company goes back to the 1500s .
madonna !
sure , the best pieces ... they never export , you see .
i want one and all here to know what a wild man hugo was in his day .
remember what he did at the bund meeting in paterson ?
threw that cherry bomb on those krauts ?
yeah , tell that one .
you made my father &apos;s year with that gun .
he deserves it .
you look beat . take a break . - nah ,
i &apos;m all right .
could use a beer , though . - well ,
you got it .
thanks .
how &apos;s that look ? done ?
you &apos;re the grill @-@ meister .
don &apos;t get me wrong ,
we have the greatest legal system in the world ,
but it &apos;s becoming more and more discriminatory .
if you &apos;re a minority , or worse , an immigrant from an arab country ,
civil rights don &apos;t apply at all .
in no place is the breach of civil rights more evident than the penal system .
rehabilitation ? please .
yeah .
that nature of the system instils the convict mentality
to the point where prison becomes the only venue where the convict can function .
my little bleeding heart .
she is wise beyond her years .
she better be ,
all the money i &apos;m spending over at liberal university in sunny harlem .
come here .
how you doing ?
good .
remember when you were little what i called you ?
you don &apos;t remember ? - you were too young to remember ?
stop !
how could you not remember ?
you know hugh built this house ?
your friend &apos;s maxing out the situation down at puss &apos;s .
sure .
factory seat , 2k . i tried .
i &apos;d hate to see ange get stuck with that .
then again , her friend is taking me to the cleaners with this divorce shit .
i gotta belt @-@ tighten .
can we get some able @-@ bodied seamen over here ? tony b ?
what am i , a fucking slave ?
i didn &apos;t have a drop .
goddamn you .
lester &apos;ll drive . he &apos;s in the bathroom.watch your head .
hey ! virginia mayo .
thank you for coming.i &apos;m sorry for everything . what can i say ?
get my boy home safe .
you &apos;re sorry ? for what ?
no , no . i wanna hear .
oh , please , carmela .
the off @-@ colour jokes , the sausage twirling ...
these are cultured italians .
russ is a success , a diplomat .
this was a shock for them .
he &apos;s such a diplomat he insults his host ?
you heard what he said to tony . he &apos;s a pompous man.- he always was .
let &apos;s talk about this another time .
that &apos;s why you didn &apos;t want tony here .
it had nothing to do with our situation .
all along , it was so that your cultured italian friends ,
who were born and raised on arthur avenue , i might add ,
wouldn &apos;t meet tony the gavone .
he made us all look like gavones .
whatever we are , i am proud of it , unlike you obviously .
i have always been proud of my heritage .
bullshit . you told aunt rose you were
glad deangelis didn &apos;t end in a vowel .
i never said that ! and when meadow came out ...
&quot; oh my god , she &apos;s so dark . &quot;
you &apos;re drunk . i &apos;m going home .
there are italians all around with their closet self @-@ loathing .
i just never wanted to believe my mother was one of them .
