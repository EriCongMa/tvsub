torez to command !
torez to command !
i &apos;ve got trespassers down by the site !
i repeat
trespassers down by the site ! i &apos;m in pursuit !
help me . help me !
i think i broke my leg .
please , i @-@ i need a hospital .
ah , no ! no , please !
where is she ? i don &apos;t see her .
she said she &apos;s gonna text
right when she lands ,
so i &apos;m waiting for the text , you see ?
what ?
nothing .
what do you mean , &quot; nothing &quot; ?
do i look like a goof ? is this too much ?
maybe a little bit .
a little bit ?
you should have said something in the car .
look , gabby &apos;s been gone nine months-- i figure
i &apos;d do something nice but i look like an idiot .
it &apos;s too much . you &apos;re right .
hello . welcome to hawaii . got you some flowers .
aloha .
thanks .
aloha . thank you . that &apos;s right .
some balloons for you , sir . enjoy .
oh , thanks , dude .
chocolates for you .
welcome to hawaii .
mahalo .
thank you . i feel better now .
all right , this is her . this is her .
and , um ...
what is it ?
it &apos;s a ...
change of plans , monkey . she &apos;s not coming .
why not ?
because , uh , she got more work
to do in morocco , i guess .
i &apos;m sorry , danno .
you &apos;re what ? you &apos;re sorry ? what do you mean , you &apos;re sorry ?
listen , i got you , so i don &apos;t need anything else .
i got the prettiest lady in hawaii , all right ?
come here .
welcome to paradise , huh ?
is that her ?
no , it &apos;s work , monkey . come on .
she give you a reason ?
a reason why she &apos;s staying in morocco
or why she stood me up at the airport ?
either .
she got offered a fellowship ,
she decided to take it .
i guess she didn &apos;t want to hurt my feelings .
i mean , i @-@ i @-@ i sort of thought that
we had something nice going ,
but if i cannot compete with sandstorms and artifacts ,
i guess it was time to reevaluate anyway , right ?
so the victim &apos;s name is chad torez .
he &apos;s a security guard with kalaunu construction .
they &apos;re out here doing a geological survey
in connection with the light rail .
according to a supervisor ,
torez was out on patrol last night
when he radioed in a report about some trespassers .
based on some footprints ,
it looks like he was chasing them down ,
he fell into the hole ,
and the suspects circled back and shot him .
hpd just found some fresh tire tracks
about a hundred yards over .
they &apos;re getting casts . but it &apos;s weird .
i spoke to the foreman and he said
these holes weren &apos;t here a couple of days ago .
in fact , his crew hadn &apos;t actually started working yet .
i &apos;m guessing that
the holes didn &apos;t dig themselves .
could &apos;ve been our perps .
i think i might know what they were looking for .
what is that ?
given the absence of a middle phalange ,
i believe it &apos;s a skeletal remain of a human thumb .
wait a minute . there &apos;s another body in this hole ?
that is correct .
although , clearly it &apos;s been removed .
okay , well , if this was a a grave ...
what about all these other holes ?
there were 11 holes-- each one appears
to have contained one body .
my chemical analysis of the decomposition fluids
within the soil suggest
the bodies have been in there from anytime between
six months to 18 years .
all right , so somebody &apos;s been using this field
as their own personal graveyard going on two decades .
assuming it &apos;s our suspects ,
i &apos;m guessing they heard about the light rail coming through ,
figured they better move these bodies
before a construction team dug &apos; em up , right ?
what about ids ?
let &apos;s start with jim henley .
he was a longshoreman
who went missing seven years ago .
i dug a little deeper , though , and it turns out
he was also a confidential informant .
informing on who ?
the yakuza .
then there &apos;s also ken nagoya , stacy ford ,
both of whom were eyewitnesses in separate homicide cases
against two yakuza members .
both of them disappeared
before they were able to testify .
still waiting for ids on the rest ,
but at this point , i &apos;d say it &apos;s a safe bet that
they were all on a yakuza hit list .
so this field was a body dump .
there &apos;ve been rumors for years
that the yakuza had one somewhere on the island .
looks like we found it .
cath , what &apos;s going on ?
hey , um , do you have a moment ?
yeah , sure . give me a sec , will you , guys ?
all right .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m fine .
um , listen , do you remember kevin hobbs
from the naval academy ?
yeah . linebacker for the mids .
what about him ?
well , he &apos;s with the fbi now .
he gave me a ring earlier &apos; cause he knows
that i have a direct line to you .
okay .
and , um ...
catherine , what &apos;s wrong ? what ?
listen , steve , he told me something
off the record that i think you really need to know .
all right , we need a list of all
known yakuza on the island .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to the fbi .
kono , maybe you should talk to adam ,
see if he knows anything about this field .
yeah , of course .
hey , uh , danny , i gotta take care of something .
just call me if you get any traction on the case , all right ?
whoa , whoa , ho . what was that ?
you left a smoke trail .
it &apos;s nothing .
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
are we gonna do that game now ?
listen , danny , it &apos;s probably better
if you don &apos;t know this one .
no , see , this is where i strongly disagree .
okay , would you stop , please ? stop .
last month the fbi &apos;s computer forensics unit caught somebody
hacking into the national fingerprint database .
now , it took them some time ,
but they think they finally have a suspect .
so what ? why are you acting goofy because of that ?
because the suspect is my mother .
okay , apparently she covered her tracks pretty well ,
but now the feds have been able to trace
an ip back to a wi @-@ fi hotspot
and they can place doris there around the time of the hack .
okay , do you have any idea why she &apos;s doing this ?
i have no idea .
all i know is the feds are closing in .
i gotta go see her right now .
hey , honey , what are you doing here ?
we need to talk .
really ? &apos; cause i was just on my way out .
oh , yeah ?
some place that has free wi @-@ fi maybe ?
because if you &apos;re planning on hacking into
another highly secured government database ,
you should try to make sure
you don &apos;t get caught on camera .
you got nothing to say ?
okay , for what it &apos;s worth , i did the fbi a favor .
i identified their weak spots .
mom , do you have any idea how serious this is ?
you &apos;re looking at jail time here .
oh , come on . this is circumstantial . it &apos;s nothing .
can you hear yourself right now ?
okay , at least let me explain .
this should be good .
over coffee . come on . let &apos;s just sit down
and talk this through , please ?
can we go ?
what was that ? somebody &apos;s here ?
no one &apos;s here . can we just ... ?
who is here ?
i have to go .
steve , just wait , steve !
commander .
steve .
what the hell is going on ?
okay , no more lies , no more games .
just tell me what &apos;s going on .
okay .
i was looking into who stole the microfiche ,
and mick and wade have been helping .
that &apos;s why you hacked the fbi ?
yeah , i pulled a print from the break @-@ in .
i needed an id , and i ... i didn &apos;t want
to get you involved .
okay , who &apos;s your suspect ?
give me a name .
i &apos;ll have &apos; em picked up in ten minutes .
you can &apos;t .
and why is that ?
because they still have the microfiche .
you move in now , you &apos;ll blow any chance i have
of stealing it back .
are you serious ?
yeah .
what happened to you , mom ?
what happened to the woman who used to make fried baloney sandwiches
and was on the pta
and who showed me how to paddle an outrigger ,
and used to teach me magic tricks ?
i mean , where &apos;d you go ? !
you think i want to be doing this ?
honey , i &apos;m trying to start over ,
but i can &apos;t until i know we &apos;re safe .
you know without that microfiche we &apos;re vulnerable .
i have to get it back . i will get it back .
i think you &apos;re right .
what &apos;s going on ?
three more ids came back .
i followed up on all three cases
and it turns out that
michael noshimuri was a suspect in two of them .
was he in charged ?
no . um ,
he was questioned , but because they never found a body ,
nothing ever stuck .
so , listen , um , i think that &apos; cause of your relationship
with adam , you should probably sit this one out .
chin and i will talk to michael
and we &apos;ll also talk to adam if we have to .
okay .
michael noshimuri .
detective williams , chin ho kelly .
we got to talk to you .
i &apos;ll be with you in a minute .
not gonna help the guy up ?
chin ho kelly ?
my brother &apos;s tapping your cousin , right ?
guess that makes us practically related , right ?
you better watch your mouth .
so what can i do for you boys ?
you just come here to watch me sweat ?
oh , no , no , no , no , we , uh ...
we want to ask you a couple questions .
you , um , recognize these guys ?
hey , right here , pay attention .
you recognize these guys ?
no .
no ?
you know , why don &apos;t you take another look ?
we know you were questioned by hpd
when both of them disappeared .
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s all coming back to me now .
i was wrongfully accused and i was cleared .
no , no , no , no , you weren &apos;t , you weren &apos;t cleared .
they never found a body so we couldn &apos;t press charges .
is that why you &apos;re here , because you found the bodies ?
you know we didn &apos;t find no bodies .
no , what we found was that last night two guys
dug them up , so that they would never be discovered .
and this relates to me how ?
i &apos;m gonna get to that , uh ...
where were you last night ?
seriously ?
yeah , seriously .
i was at home .
anybody who can vouch for that ?
555 @-@ 0198 .
leo bates .
who is that ?
oh , wait , let me guess .
that &apos;s a number of your ex @-@ con buddy who &apos;s gonna say
he was with you even if he wasn &apos;t , right ?
no , that &apos;s my lawyer .
you got any more questions , ask him .
we &apos;re done here .
all right , uh , we &apos;ll make it simple .
we know that you &apos;re involved in this , okay ?
you should say hi to kono for me .
and if you got any more cousins like that ,
you should send them my way .
oh , no , no , no , go easy .
i &apos;m right here .
okay , you &apos;re right here , everybody &apos;s right here ,
we &apos;re all right here .
all right , listen to me .
uh , you ever disrespect my friend like that again ,
i &apos;m gonna let him come back here and bust
your pretty face up , okay ?
the prints i ran through the fbi database belong to this man .
james austin .
he &apos;s ex @-@ military , dishonorably discharged .
what &apos;s his interest with the microfiche ?
no interest .
he was just a hired gun .
hired by who ?
tyler cain .
we were at the cia together .
after that he opened a private military company ,
supplying mercs to every dictator with a checkbook .
but now he &apos;s about to be appointed
director of national intelligence ,
which requires senate confirmation .
okay , so let me guess .
while cain was with the agency ,
he did some things that the senate wouldn &apos;t approve of ,
and the only real evidence of that is in the microfiche .
exactly .
it begs a question .
why doesn &apos;t he destroy the microfiche ?
why &apos;s he holding on to it ?
same reason doris held onto it for so many years .
leverage .
a lot of ex @-@ operatives could get burned by what &apos;s on there .
cain could use that to his advantage .
all right , you said you know where it is .
first honolulu tower .
cain keeps it in a safe in his office on the 16th floor .
but getting it back won &apos;t be easy .
the building is highly secure .
there are at least ten armed guards stationed
inside around the clock .
aloha . here to check your fire extinguishers .
there are cameras ...
at every entrance .
okay , there you go , sir .
thank you .
in every hallway .
and every stairwell .
and every elevator .
and then there &apos;s the key cards .
there &apos;s not a single door or entrance
in the entire building that doesn &apos;t require one .
no , no .
no , no , i don &apos;t want you to sell for less than one point four .
yeah , if you talked to them , that would be the ...
oh , i am , i am so ...
terribly sorry .
that was entirely my fault .
that &apos;s quite all right .
please forgive me .
i was on a long @-@ distance call to europe and i ...
my name is heidi .
heidi . listen , heidi , here you go .
oh , thank you .
uh , could i take you to lunch ?
yeah , that would be great actually .
thank you .
geez , flirt much ?
i only have eyes for you , darling .
okay , what about the safe ?
well , that was a little harder .
uh , the safe is voice @-@ activated .
but with time and patience ,
we were able to record cain &apos;s voice
and cobble together his pass @-@ phrase .
honey ,
i &apos;m telling you , we &apos;ve got this so covered .
look , you guys have done your homework ,
all right , but once you &apos;re inside
something &apos;s gonna happen that you didn &apos;t plan on .
okay , you know that .
and one mistake with this
level of security could be deadly .
i &apos;m sorry , but this isn &apos;t a mission .
it &apos;s a suicide pact .
oh , please .
was he always this negative ?
he doesn &apos;t get it from me .
this is crazy .
you know what people your age are doing ?
they &apos;re not planning covert ops , okay ?
they @-@ they &apos;re in book clubs .
you know what they do at nighttime ?
book club ?
they play bridge at night .
and besides , you two ,
you should not be enabling her .
thank you for your input , steven ,
but this is happening .
you want to stop us-- arrest us .
otherwise we &apos;re going in , tonight .
i missed you .
i missed you , too .
hey , listen , i &apos;m sorry if i scared you .
there was a crisis and i had to go
to japan at the last minute .
right .
so , how did it go ?
should be okay .
but it &apos;s just business .
i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want to hear about it .
you met with riku sato .
why wouldn &apos;t i want to hear about that ?
what are you ... ?
you were spying on me ?
no , adam , i was worried about you .
i hadn &apos;t heard from you in days .
so i came here and you were gone .
and then two yakuza showed up .
what did they want ?
they didn &apos;t say , but they were armed .
adam , would you tell me what &apos;s going on ?
why are you being so secretive ?
and why are you meeting with a man like sato ?
what &apos;s going on is ...
i &apos;m trying to cut my family &apos;s last ties to the yakuza .
really ? &apos; cause that &apos;s not what it looks like .
i know , believe me , i know how this looks .
and i don &apos;t blame you for being suspicious , but ...
i can &apos;t talk about it , okay ?
adam ...
you &apos;re just , you &apos;re just gonna have to trust me !
you want me to trust you ?
you &apos;re gonna have to give me something .
okay .
what ?
what do you know about a field off of h2
where the yakuza &apos;s been hiding bodies ?
nothing . why ?
you know nothing about someone digging it up ?
no , i &apos;ve never even heard of this place .
what &apos;s this about ?
adam , just look me in the eye and tell me
what you know about it .
i know nothing about it .
i swear .
you believe me , right ?
yeah .
yeah ?
it &apos;s adam , we need to talk .
what &apos;s the problem ?
i just got a visit from five @-@ o.
two hours .
i &apos;ll call you with a location .
hey , fong , uh , it &apos;s kono .
remember that , uh , that phone you helped me clone ?
it just made an outgoing call .
i need you to ping that number right away .
thank you .
five @-@ o , drop your weapons .
hands in the air .
don &apos;t even think about it .
drop the weapon .
10 @-@ 15 . officer down .
10 @-@ 15 ...
chin ? - hey .
how &apos;s kono ?
she &apos;s gonna be okay .
no vital organs were hit .
but when she gets back on her feet ,
i &apos;m gonna kill her .
what were you thinking ?
i &apos;m sorry , steve .
you &apos;re s ... ?
what were you doing going in here without any back up ?
i was running down a lead .
what lead ? where &apos;d you get a lead from ?
i got it from adam .
kono ...
sorry , commander ,
we &apos;re gonna have to take her to the hospital now .
all right , i &apos;ll go with her , then head back to hq .
you all right ?
i &apos;ll be good .
good .
all right , so hpd id &apos;d the two guys
that shot it out with kono as yakuza hit men .
okay , what else we got ?
both had nine millimeters , same caliber as the shell casings
we found at the body dump .
and out the back , we got tire tracks
that might be a match as well .
so these were the same guys
who killed chad torez .
check this out .
and here are our missing vics .
i &apos;m thinking the barrels of sand ...
they were waiting for the sun to go down
so they could dump the bodies in the ocean .
right , but these guys are still just foot soldiers .
they &apos;re taking orders from somebody else .
yeah , michael noshimuri .
we will get him . maybe not today , but we &apos;ll get him .
hey , max .
afternoon , commander . detective .
uh , please forgive me for being rude ,
but perhaps we can skip our customary repartee ?
as you can see , i have quite a bit of work to do .
yeah , we &apos;ll get out of your way .
good luck .
yeah ?
what , uh ... what &apos;s going on with doris ?
it &apos;s not good .
it turns out she lied to me about more than
just hacking into the fbi database .
ah . you more upset about that , or ...
the fact that she &apos;s in trouble ?
look , look , all right , look , it &apos;s none of my business .
all right ?
but whatever she did ... so what ? right ?
she &apos;s your mother ,
and she &apos;s in trouble , you gotta help her .
right ?
if you &apos;re going to try to talk me out of going again ,
you can just leave .
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m going with you .
no . no , honey there is no way i &apos;m gonna let you do this .
mom , somebody &apos;s got to watch your back .
this guy cain isn &apos;t somebody you want to mess with .
i &apos;ve got mick and wade , i &apos;ll be fine .
listen ...
three retirees launching a covert op ?
how do you think that &apos;s gonna go down ?
no . no , no , you can &apos;t risk it .
steve , you &apos;ve got too much to lose .
your job , your whole life here . no .
just listen to me .
forget all that , okay ?
i lost you once before .
i &apos;m not gonna lose you again .
i &apos;m going with you .
night , mr. cain .
cain just left for the evening .
i &apos;m going in .
rope , rope , rope .
go , go , go !
okay , mcgarretts , the elevators are mine .
you &apos;re good to go .
eat up , sistah .
most people don &apos;t know this ,
but shrimp got healing power .
it &apos;s a super @-@ food .
shrimp is the new &quot; motzo &quot; ball soup .
it &apos;s &quot; matzo . &quot; matzo ball .
whatever .
okay , well , healthy or not ,
it &apos;s still way better than the hospital food , so thanks .
so what &apos;s , uh , going on with our case ?
well , max is processing the remains you found .
hopefully , he pulls some slugs that we can match ballistics to .
but right now
the only thing you need to worry about is getting healthy .
well , i appreciate the concern , cuz ,
but i &apos;m gonna be okay .
the doctor said i was lucky , and , um ,
i should be able to get out of here in a few days .
and if you do , it &apos;s because of the shrimp .
yeah , most likely . um ...
we &apos;re gonna let you get some rest and we &apos;ll see you later .
let &apos;s get out of here .
all right . thanks for coming by .
all right . see you soon .
okay .
i hope this wasn &apos;t some attempt to get out of dinner with me .
adam ... how did you , uh ...
chin ho called .
he told me what happened .
kono ... i &apos;m sorry .
i feel like this is all my fault .
what are you talking about ?
i need to tell you something .
after you came to see me ,
i called some people .
i was trying to find out about that field you mentioned .
you see ... i think michael &apos;s involved .
i should &apos;ve told you .
maybe if i had ...
you would &apos;ve held off , and ...
i thought i was protecting you , but i was wrong .
i was wrong ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
hey , it &apos;s okay .
what is it ?
adam , there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
excuse me .
it &apos;s time for your ct scan .
don &apos;t leave , okay ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
all right . i &apos;m not going anywhere .
we need to talk .
okay .
mom , you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
hey , mick ,
we &apos;re at cain &apos;s floor .

hold up .
the guards are watching their monitors . stand by .
i want you to watch very carefully .
what are you doing ?
come on , are you watching ?
no . mom , no .
come on ... just watch .
just ... mom , please . i &apos;m not nine anymore .
you &apos;re never too old for magic .
just watch carefully .

i &apos;m not gonna blow magic breath .
you &apos;re gonna breath .

what &apos;s this ? what &apos;s this ?
mick .
we &apos;ve got an elevator coming up the shaft .
i know , i know .
mick .
mick , can we move into the hallway ?
negative-- i &apos;ve still got one guard at the desk .
mick , do something !
i &apos;m trying , i &apos;m trying .
okay , you &apos;re all clear .
go , go , go .
ok .
come on , let &apos;s go .
my name is tyler cain .
this is my voice .
verify me .
is that it ?
yeah , let &apos;s get out of here .
what the hell is that ?
must &apos;ve triggered a hidden sensor . let &apos;s go .
mick , kill all camera feeds to the guard &apos;s desk .
on it . wade , how &apos;s our exit ?
blown-- two guards with automatic weapons on the roof .
hey you , stop !
mick , what &apos;s happening ? mick ?
you &apos;ve got guards on 9 , 11 and 14 .
get to the 12th floor .
there &apos;s a window washer platform
outside the northeast corner office .
go !
we &apos;re not gonna make it .
you &apos;re right , go .
i &apos;m gonna cover you .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna cover you . go , go .
steve !
mick !
mick , i need another way out of here .
ok . freight elevator , kid .
i &apos;ll drop you on three .
there &apos;s an outdoor plaza .
the stairs will lead right down to street level .
freeze !
got one of them ...
stop ! freeze !
freeze !
hold it right where you are .
steve , we got a problem .
hands in the air .
it &apos;s your mom .
mick ?
what &apos;s happening ?
they got her , steve .
mick ?
mick , where are you ?
outside .
sorry , kid , i had to bail .
they were moving in .
any idea where they &apos;re holding her ?
no , but cain just got back .
he &apos;s heading in now-- you got to get out of there .
nah , i can &apos;t do that , mick .
steve , listen to me .
doris made it very clear .
the op gets blown , we walk .
hey , she &apos;s my mother , all right ?
i &apos;m not leaving her .
doris mcgarrett .
been a long time .
not long enough .
somewhat disappointing .
the doris mcgarrett i knew wouldn &apos;t have screwed up
an op this bad .
you &apos;re looking a little rough around the edges yourself , tyler .
i didn &apos;t find the microfiche ,
but she did have this , mr. cain .
well , whoever you are , i know you can hear me .
it seems that we each have something that the other wants .
so let &apos;s keep it simple .
let &apos;s say five minutes , my office .
one second over , she dies .
mick , mick .
you give them that microfiche ,
you are both dead .
how do you want to play it ?
all right , go check it out .
drop your weapon .
what are you gonna do ?
put it down !
all right , all right , easy , easy .
now , let &apos;s just take it easy there .
yeah , i was gonna call the police
but i see they &apos;ve already arrived .
it &apos;s commander mcgarrett , isn &apos;t it ?
head of five @-@ o ?
put it down .
geez , doris , you involved your son in this ?
it was my choice .
he never listens to his mother .
well , i don &apos;t know what your game is here , kid ,
but you got three seconds
to produce the microfiche .
open it .
unroll it , please .
now hand it over .
you hand my mother over .
okay , let &apos;s try this again .
you hand it over , i let her go .
don &apos;t trust him , steve .
what are you gonna do , hmm ?
you gonna watch her die , son ?
i think you &apos;re out of moves .
no , you &apos;re wrong .
you didn &apos;t want anybody to see what was on there anyway , right ?
now nobody ever will .
congratulations , sir .
you &apos;re gonna get your senate confirmation ,
and you &apos;re gonna get your big job .
but that &apos;s all you &apos;re gonna get .
the thing is , mr. cain ,
people know we &apos;re here .
people know we &apos;re here ,
and if we don &apos;t walk out of here ,
they &apos;re gonna know what happened .
and you &apos;re going to get nothing .
it &apos;s your call .
all right , go .
get the hell out of here .
before i change my mind .
come on , let &apos;s go .
go on !
let &apos;s go .
wade , ready for pickup in 60 seconds .
copy that .
you okay ?

what &apos;s your point ?
no , no , no , no point .
i just , uh , makes me wonder

no , she probably just wants to , uh , apologize again
about how poorly she treated me , about her bad behavior .

you &apos;re just gonna punish her ?
hey , max , what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s up , buddy ?

out of one of the bodies recovered from the warehouse .

20 minutes ago it got a hit .
