Hi. How you doing?
Good.
Could you hang up the cell phone?
Sure. I... I looked at the speedometer--
I was only going 35.
Could I see your driver's license and registration, please?
You been drinking?
Have... I...
No, I'm... It's 3:00.
I-I'm headed to class.
I smell alcohol on your breath.
Have you been drinking?
No.
You have a cold?
I did. Um...
But I'm-I'm getting over it.
Did you know certain
cold medications can impact your faculties?
Uh, yes, I... But I'm fine. Seriously.
Then you wouldn't mind if I administer a Breathalyzer?
No.
Good.
Unfortunately, I don't have one in the car.
Would you mind accompanying me to the station?
Lockhart/Gardner.
I'm sorry, who would you like?
Alicia Florrick. Hold on, please.
Be right back.
Yes!
It's excellent news.
Welcome back, Diane.
Her first order of business
will be this malpractice suit...
One second.
You wanted me to tell you
when any clients called for Alicia or Cary.
Yes. Who is it?
Jeffrey Grant.
Oh, Grant Real Estate. Mid-level client.
His dad was arrested two months ago for assault.
Alicia handled it.
We don't want to lose them to Alicia's firm.
Got it.
Hello, Jeffrey.
This is Will Gardner. How's your dad?
Uh, he's-he's good.
He's... he's at home.
Who is this?
Will Gardner, Alicia's boss.
Alicia no longer works at the firm.
But can you tell me your issue?
I'd love to see what I can do.
Well, yeah. I don't know, something's weird here. I got...
pulled over for I guess speeding.
And they say I've been drinking, but I haven't.
Do you have Alicia's number?
I don't, actually. Where are you now?
It's the 29th District.
I've been waiting for a Breathalyzer,
but it's been, like, an hour.
I bring in more capital into this firm...
Why don't I come on down there and see what I can do.
Both of you, please!
Of course you don't have malpractice suits in tax law.
Who gives a damn about tax law?
Okay, stop it.
Listen to me, all of you.
There are no more fights at this firm.
No more internal squabbles.
We work together. Now, this malpractice suit
is an irritant, but it can't slow us down
unless we let it slow us down, do you understand?
Move together, act together, or leave.
That's all I want: to act together.
Diane, you take it.
Where are you going?
Out to stop a client from leaving.
So, insurance has reviewed
the $6 million lawsuit against us
and denied coverage due to "Attorney recklessness."
I wasn't reckless.
It was a failed adoption.
Emotions run high in adoptions.
This was the Gopniks?
Yes, they adopted a two-month-old girl,
but the genetic parents fought to get her back.
I told them that it was unlikely we would win.
They're disgruntled. They're lashing out. Seen it before.
Who was the associate supervisor?
I don't know. I was on the Zander divorce.
I put it into the rotation.
Well, the depositions start tomorrow,
and we have to prep someone,
so which associate signed off on it?
Want to guess?
We're in financial trouble.
We didn't get our bonuses.
Oh, come on, Anthony, would you stop with the bonus talk?
What if we lower our sights on office space?
Look further south.
The problem is the length of the lease.
We don't want to get trapped in someplace too downscale.
And Chumhum?
We won't see their retainer money for another 45 days.
We won't see it at all if they realize
what a shoestring we're running...
Oh, come... they knew they were moving their business
Were you chatting on Mom's computer earlier?
What? Can you knock?
Were you using Mom's computer?
No. Why?
Her Webcam was on.
Okay, look, we all knew this would be hard.
Every new firm has...
their struggles.
Stern-Lockhart started in an airport hotel room.
So hold it together.
What we're going through now will make our firm stronger.
Alicia Florrick?
Yep.
Subpoena or restraining order?
Subpoena. You guys should get an office.
It's hard to find you.
We'll get right on that.
Lockhart/Gardner?
Are we being sued?
Because I'm thinking we should countersue,
stop playing defense.
No.
They're being sued.
What?
Then why are you being served?
I'm a witness.
You must be Jeffrey?
Mr. Gardner?
Uh, Will's fine.
I'm sorry I'm late. You doing some homework?
Italian.
Have they tested you yet?
No. I saw the patrolman go by here a minute ago.
There he is.
Okay.
Now, you just sit tight.
Jeffrey, what did the patrolman say when he stopped you?
What did he say?
He said... he smelled alcohol on my breath.
But he saw I had cold medicine.
He said that must be it. Why?
Nothing. There's an ASA over there talking with him.
Yeah, she was in the patrol car.
She was in the patrol car?
Yes.
And you haven't gotten a Breathalyzer yet?
No.
And they took a... cotton swab from inside my mouth.
What... they... Why?
They didn't say.
Should I be worried?
Not yet.
Have you had any other brushes with the law, Jeffrey?
I had some issues when I was in high school.
I got pulled over on another DUI, but...
I would never drink and drive again.
Okay. Don't worry. I'll be right back.
Geneva, what's going on here?
What do you mean?
What I mean is, why is an ASA
out stopping a college student on a phony DUI?
I don't know why you're calling it phony.
Well, an hour after the pull-over,
and still no Breathalyzer, no blood test?
Every time he pees, your case is literally going down the toilet.
But you swabbed for DNA, which is irrelevant to sobriety.
We were just trying to be diligent, Will.
Ah. That's what it's called?
Well, I'm taking my client home, okay?
And I want you to discard that DNA.
Have a good day.
Actually, no.
Your client is under arrest for driving under the influence,
and given his previous arrests,
we were with our rights to collect his DNA.
You're opening yourself up to a suit.
I breathe in the morning, I'm opening myself up to a suit.
Okay, they've arrested you,
but clearly, they're after something else.
They arrested me? Why?
I don't know, but...
I need you to breathe into this.
Your Honor, the blood alcohol limit
for inebriation in Illinois is 0.08%.
According to this pocket Breathalyzer,
my client's blood alcohol concentration
was 0.00001.
That's a whole lot of zeroes, Mrs. ASA.
Sounds to me like you pulled over the wrong kid.
My apologies, Your Honor.
The State is prepared to dismiss the charge.
It was our mistake. We apologize to Mr. Grant.
If the State is dropping the arrest,
we ask that the DNA swab collected from my client be destroyed, too.
We'd love to, Your Honor,
but we're rearresting Mr. Grant on a murder charge.
What?
We're arresting Mr. Grant
for the murder of Dani Littlejohn,
a college student who was found outside her dorm
on the Chicago Polytech campus last August
with blunt trauma to her skull.
That's quite a step up from a DUI.
It is.
And as you can see from this report,
Miss Littlejohn struggled with her killer,
whose DNA was found under her fingernails.
Your Honor... Hold on, Counselor.
Here, take a look at this.
We had no match for this DNA evidence
until two months ago, when his father was arrested for assault.
As part of the father's standard processing,
his DNA was taken and entered
into the statewide database, where we got a hit--
a familial match for Dani Littlejohn's killer.
A familial match.
So the killer could be anybody in that kid's family.
Yes, any male in his family--
but Jeffrey Grant is the only one
at the same school as Miss Littlejohn.
Your Honor, this-this stinks.
This phony DUI charge was used as an excuse to...
Counselor, this is way past phony DUI's
at this point-- I will deny the writ of habeas corpus,
and allow the state's attorney
their 48 hours upon arrest to charge.
Is the ASA charging now, Your Honor?
No, not until we get a match on the DNA.
Then it's illegal for them to collect and test Jeffrey's DNA.
And according to Illinois law,
they can only do that upon charges. Not according
to the Supreme Court. In Maryland v. King...
Which is a general rule.
The specific law in this state, Your Honor,
is very, very clear about that.
Okay, okay, hold on. If you two want
to debate like law students, go do it somewhere else.
For now, the kid stays in custody.
And if you want to test his DNA,
charge him.
I'll call your parents.
When can I get out?
48 hours, max.
Hang tight.
I...
Could you...?
David, hello!
What the hell are you doing here?
Answering my subpoena.
In reception,
that's where people who don't work here wait.
You moved into my office pretty quick.
Yes, after I cleaned the carpets of brimstone.
I've hurt you, haven't I?
Mrs. Florrick. Hello.
Ms. Lockhart. Hello.
So... you're being sued again.
I'm not sure how I can help you if I can't...
It's the Gopnik adoption.
Myra Gopnik?
Yes.
They lost her to the genetic parents.
They're suing us for $6 million,
saying that we botched the adoption.
You didn't find out that the father was one-eighth Chippewa,
so Indian tribal courts held sway.
No, I knew that.
You did?
And did you tell the Gopniks?
It was a long time ago.
It was less than a year ago.
I know. But so much has happened.
I've been let go.
I've had my financial requests rejected.
You're gonna blackmail us for your testimony?
No, I'm just telling the truth.
It's hard to remember when there's been
so much tension in my life about money.
What tension?
My capital contribution.
The $150,000 I gave Lockhart/Gardner
as a first installment when I made partner.
The $150,000 that should've been
returned to me when I left.
When you stole our clients.
David.
You know, sometimes I look at you
and I wonder if you've changed
or if you were always this way.
I had some of the best teachers in the world.
I couldn't help but change.
So you will testify for us
if you get your capital contribution refunded?
Yes.
And what will your testimony be?
The check first.
Call me... when you're ready.
She has us.
Hi. Are you here to look at the computers?
Um, no.
You're here for the law firm?
Yes.
Okay. Come on in.
This is Florrick-Agos?
It's cool, huh?
Yes. That's the word.
I've reviewed... your financials,
and, um, I'm sad to say they're not good.
Keep in mind we're a new venture.
A new venture without offices, without paralegals,
and with a high school girl answering the door.
There is no magic in the books--
30% of your billables are spent reviewing depositions.
This is, uh...
unfortunately work you can't bill at a premium.
But we need to do it.
We don't have the manpower to delegate.
Yes.
That is why I suggest Bangalore.
As in India?
Yes. Law firms there
will perform your document review for pennies on the dollar.
And your markup...
Zach, I'm in a meeting.
Someone's ratting your computer.
What does that mean?
Remote Access Tool. RAT.
The hacker infects your computer with it,
and they can use your Webcam to spy on you.
Is someone doing that with my computer?
Yeah. I came in here, the Webcam light was on,
and then it shut off by itself.
When?
Couple hours ago.
Is there anyone that would want to be able to access your Webcam?
Why are you out here?
My computer's been hacked.
By who?
Do you think they'd do it?
I think Diane wouldn't. David Lee might.
I was over there today, they're pretty angry.
I know a virus expert who can take care of this.
No, no, let's...
let's use it.
Give them false information?
About clients we've signed.
Clients who are thinking of leaving them.
Make them chase their tails.
You know you're running a firm here, not a children's game.
I don't know her.
I never met her. I know that she's at the same school,
but I-I... it's a big school.
Now, Dani was found with ketamine in her system...
I told you, I never met her.
And I don't do drugs, I-I don't sell them.
It's fine, Jeffrey.
We're just going through the facts here.
Now, the original suspect from last year,
the professor they arrested, did you know him?
Dr. DeLaney, yeah. I was in his statistics class.
But she wasn't in it.
Yes, but this Dr. DeLaney,
he was having an affair with Dani?
That was the rumor.
Okay, I'll look into it.
And we'll have to get into the DNA.
It's not mine.
It can't be my skin under her nails.
We know, Jeffrey, but we attack this case from all sides.
It's smart for us to do that...
So tell me about your family.
The men in your family.
They have nothing to do with this.
to do with this.
Jeffrey, familial DNA means
they found DNA they can trace to someone in your family.
Your family is originally from New York, isn't it?
Does anybody else live here but you and your dad?
My sister.
No, it has to be a man.
Did anybody visit you at school?
My Uncle Jim.
He dropped by last year for help on his computer.
I don't want to get anybody in trouble.
You're not. We just need to get a feel of the case.
I, uh, got permission for you to use your textbooks.
Thanks. Got final exams next week.
Seems like you're really interested in Italy.
Yeah, I got an internship in Rome next year.
Ah. I went backpacking there after college.
Yeah? Did you like it?
Oh, yeah. I always wanted to go back,
but never got the chance-- just too busy.
I...have never been out of the country.
Do you think I'll get bail?
We'll do our best.
Sit tight, study.
Think about those finals.
And I'll see you later, okay?
Yeah.
He did it.
No. He's just nervous.
No, he did it.
I think he did something.
Maybe had a fight with her.
Well, we need to stop them from charging him
and testing that DNA.
Where are you going?
You don't want to know.
Oh. She's gonna help us?
Yep. It's amazing what money will do.
Well, hello again.
Hello.
How are the Isenstadts?
Unhappy.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
And yet here we are with more human suffering.
Can we get started,
or did you both want to play cards?
My apologies.
I had a real case to deal with.
Well, let's see
if we can turn this into a real case for you.
How long did you work on the Gopnik adoption,
Mrs. Florrick?
About four months.
Were you the supervising attorney?
I did the day-to-day management.
I looked at some of the documents the younger associates drew up.
Which documents? Which associates?
I believe John Gaultner drafted
the initial inquiry letter.
Anthony Wright Edelman
did the Gopniks' eligibility application,
but...really it was just shuffling paper.
Mr. Lee was the partner supervising the case overall.
And were you aware that the genetic father
of the adoptee was part Chippewa Indian?
I was. Or, to be more accurate...
I became aware of that.
Good. Accuracy is our friend.
And were you also aware-- or...
became aware-- that because of the child's Chippewa heritage,
the tribe had an absolute right to block this adoption?
I was, and I became aware of this.
So given this awareness,
how could you in good conscience
allow the Gopniks to proceed down this path?
Because I told them of this possibility
and they wanted to go forward with the adoption.
Are you sure of that?
Mrs. Florrick testified to the fact,
therefore she's sure of it.
Excuse me, my understanding is that
you have since left Lockhart/Gardner,
Mrs. Florrick, and therefore...
Oh... wait,
did I say "Left"?
I think the word I was looking f-for was
"Fired."
When I left, Mr. Schmidt,
I was a partner.
I couldn't be fired.
My mistake.
I just thought you would welcome this moment to be
more forthcoming about those who--
oh, what is the best word here?--
"Pushed you out of their law firm."
There must be a... German word to that effect.
Gesundschrumpfen.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Now, I believe
that Mrs. Florrick has addressed the basis for her subpoena,
so if there's nothing else... - Mrs. Florrick,
could you please tell me
what this is?
It's a check
for $10,000, drawn on the Lockhart/Gardner bank account,
made out to the Chippewa Nation.
Do you know what this check was for?
I have no idea.
I've never seen it before.
Would it surprise you to learn this was a bribe
intended to convince the tribe
not to object to the adoption.
I object to this whole line of questioning as defamatory.
And your objection is preserved for the record.
Would it also surprise you to learn
that in an affidavit,
Chief Joshua Proudfoot-- one word-- of the Chippewa Nation
asserts this check turned the tribe against the adoption?
I can only say that if the facts you relate are true
then it does surprise me.
This was a case you were, in your words,
performing the day-to-day management on.
Mr. Schmidt, she answered your question.
I just thought
Alicia would jump at the chance to assign responsibility
to the firm that fired her.
Alicia?
No, I'm good.
And have them test the audio beforehand.
Last time I lectured there I sounded like Lou Gehrig.
Professor DeLaney?
Yeah, may I help you?
Will Gardner. I left you a couple messages
about Dani Littlejohn.
Please, an innocent kid could be going to prison.
Look, I have nothing to offer; I was cleared of Dani's murder.
Now, leave me alone.
Hey, I know you.
Owen?
Yeah.
Well, Dr. Cavanaugh. You're Alicia's boss
from her work, Will.
You teach here?
I do. Yeah, mathematical sciences.
Professor of the month, actually.
I get all the frozen yogurt I want from YouGoGurt.
How's Alicia doing?
You haven't spoken to her recently?
I haven't, no. Why? Is everything okay?
I-I think so.
So, do you know Dr. DeLaney?
I do, yeah. Why?
This is pretty good.
You want another?
'Cause I got, like, a lot.
No, thanks.
So, the cops suspected, uh,
Dr. DeLaney was sleeping with Dani?
Yeah. I mean, I heard that, too.
DeLaney was going through a divorce at the time,
and, um, there were rumors of the...
Oh, uh, you don't want to hear rumors.
I do.
He had the "B-plus club."
Any student who did a B-plus or better
got invited back to his house for dinner,
and there were rumors-- and, again, I stress
they're only rumors-- that the kids would use it
to hook up, and he would encourage it.
Do you know a student named Jeffrey Grant?
I do, yeah. Nice kid. Why?
We he a part of this B-plus club?
Oh,I think so. I mean, he was a good student.
And Dani Littlejohn was, too?
That's how Dr. DeLaney became
close with her.
Ooh, it's gossip. This is professor gossip.
It's-it's the worst kind.
How's Alicia doing?
I don't know, Owen.
She's no longer at my firm.
What?
Why?
She left.
To start her own firm.
When?
Three weeks ago.
Oh, my God. What...
What happened?
I have no idea.
Yes?
Are you Jim Grant?
If this is about the lawn ornaments,
I stopped marketing them
online six months ago.
Are you Jeffrey Grant's uncle?
Why? Is he all right?
You visited him recently at college, right?
Who are you?
Kalinda.
How did you meet Dani Littlejohn?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Then how did your DNA end up under her fingernails?
They found DNA from a male relation of Jeffrey
under Dani's fingernails, and you're the only male relative
who visited the college, so...
when did you meet her?
The DNA is male, right?
That's why you're looking for a male relation?
Yeah.
Uh, wait just a moment.
This is me.
Pre-op.
That's right. My nephew doesn't know.
That was 20 years ago.
I've always been Uncle Jim to him.
Thanks.
You know, there's something else Jeffrey didn't know.
He has a half brother.
No, you know who I've been getting interest from?
The Paisley Group.
You mean Diane's top client?
Y... Yeah, yeah,
they, uh, they're not happy with her representation.
Make sure they keep it secret
from Lockhart/Gardner.
Hello, David. I'm not returning
the capital contribution; I already cashed it.
Well, you may not want to spend it yet,
because you're gonna need to come up with $6 million.
Why, are you gonna countersue me?
No. We went over the billing records
after your wonderful deposition performance, and guess what?
Smack in the middle of the adoption proceedings,
you were promoted to partner.
No.
Yes. So partner plus day-to-day management of a case
equals supervisory authority.
Call it a perk of leadership, but you're personally liable...
for the whole $6 million.
It's my issue. Wait.
It's not a Florrick-Agos issue.
It's mine.
No, it's all of ours.
If they come after you, they come after all of us.
Thanks. But I...
No buts.
You'd do the same for us.
I don't understand.
They're countersuing you?
They're saying that
since I became a partner while that case was pending,
I'm responsible for everything that happened on it,
including the bribe.
So if the Gopniks win,
I'm personally liable for the full $6 million.
I'll get it!
I need a lawyer. You know where I can find one?
Feels like somebody needs some loving in their life.
Who told you?
Who told me what?
I'm starting my own firm. Mom?
No.
Actually, um...
oddly...
Can we sit down?
Why?
Oh, because...
Oh, wow, you really are trying to do this
from your living room.
It's temporary.
So... who told you I left Lockhart/Gardner?
Oddly enough, it was Will.
He... what?
Um, I don't un... he... what... when...
Oh, this is very entertaining, watching you flail.
Well, he...
Did Will talk to you?
Yeah, he was at my college on a case,
and I bumped into him.
He-he didn't say anything.
It was only after I pushed him.
Okay. Good to know.
So, why didn't you tell me you were leaving?
I was pushed out, Owen. I didn't have time.
Will pushed me out.
Because you were thinking of leaving
and taking some of his clients?
Did he tell you that?
No, no, I'm just reading your body language here,
and you're in, like, warrior-princess mode.
Well, I'm kicking butt.
Yeah, I can see that.
I also know why you left, and that it has nothing to do
with starting your own firm.
Oh, Owen, can we not do this now?
What? You were afraid of getting close to Will.
Hey. Do you want something to eat?
Will you admit it? You were afraid
of leaving your marriage for Will,
so this is like the nuclear bomb...
Oh, hey, Grace.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing. Just visiting your lovely mother
at her new law firm.
Have you seen Zach, Mom?
What?
Could you... There's... there's something.
What's wrong? What...
When?
About five minutes ago.
Is there something else, Mr. Hayden?
There is.
I think... I think Bangalore, it'll work.
Yes.
No, it's about Mrs. Florrick's lawsuit.
Do you know something?
I worked with the books at Lockhart/Gardner.
I know everything.
Alicia.
So, what special entertainment
do you have for me this round?
Mr. Lee, always a pleasure.
Why don't you give up on this suit?
You're never gonna win.
I like suits I can't win.
They clarify the mind.
Well, let's go do some clarifying.
One second.
Just... waiting for my next witness.
Mr. Hayden. Thank you for doing this.
Mr. Lee. Good to see you again.
And how do you know this, sir?
I was the bankruptcy trustee for Lockhart/Gardner
at the time of these events.
Judas.
Did you get that?
Mr. Lee, in a clumsy attempt at intimidation,
Objection.
Might have said it too quietly.
"Judas."
as in Judas Iscariot, the betrayer of Christ.
And so you were privy to Lockhart/Gardner's books?
Yes.
Mr. Hayden,
much of this information is privileged.
Not this information, ma'am.
Lockhart/Gardner is contending that
Alicia Florrick was the supervisor at the time of this bribe
to the Indian council.
Is that correct?
No.
In October, I recommended to Ms. Lockhart and Mr. Gardner
that they dedicate more partner hours to cases.
And David Lee was assigned as the lawyer of record.
Which means he was
legally responsible for supervising?
And personally liable here.
Looks like it's back in your court.
Yeah, Kalinda, what's up?
I found his half brother.
You did? Great.
Yeah. I don't think he'll let me cotton-swab his mouth,
but I'll see what I can get.
Office is up front if you want to place an order.
Actually, I'm here to talk to you.
You're... Anderson Prickett, right?
And you are?
Kalinda Sharma.
I'm investigating working conditions
at companies in the area.
Look, uh...
I just want to make sure that
management isn't harassing you.
Harassing me for...?
Your arrest last year, for one.
You were busted dealing ketamine, right?
You with the Labor Board?
Also trying to make sure
that workers aren't getting their pay docked for sick days.
Your manager said you called in sick last year
on the 15th of August.
Where were you?
What are you doing?
So you acknowledge
bringing the Gopnik adoption case in the door?
Well, I'm not sure what you mean
by "In the door."
Mr. Lee, I've got Mrs. Florrick outside
ready to be re-deposed,
so can we handle this civilly?
I brought in the business.
So, the $10,000 that was sent to the reservation...
I've already said it didn't come from me.
But I know who sent it.
You do? And who might that be?
The brother looks good for this.
And the gum?
That's not something they can ignore.
Absolutely. It's already over there.
Geneva knows.
They're checking the DNA.
20 hours to go. I'll talk to you.
I didn't supervise him.
And who is this person,
this Anthony Wright Edelman?
Oh, one of these little idiots who left with Alicia-- the Indian kid.
And you're saying he sent out the bribe to the Chippewa council?
I'm swearing he sent it out.
How very convenient for you,
given that Alicia superv...
Yes, I offered the tribe cash
to sign off on the adoption.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking I wanted to win.
You lost their adoption.
Their adoption was lost.
I was making a last-ditch...
You just screwed over Alicia.
Wait.
Did you consult with David Lee before you sent out the check?
No.
Did you consult with anyone else? Any partner?
Howard Lyman.
You consulted with Howard Lyman?
And he approved?
He did.
Well, we need to get you deposed.
Call Carter Schmidt.
Zach, It's on!
What's wrong?
Nothing. Just something for Zach.
Yeah, we have to do some stuff for school,
Mom-- on my computer.
It just came on a second ago.
Okay, so, once we go in,
just start undressing, all right?
What?
Just take off your sweater or something, all right?
You need to keep the hacker online long enough
for us to trace him.
How you doing, Will?
You know you have five hours left
to charge or release.
I did know that.
But I thought we'd sit down together
and see if maybe we could work out a deal.
They can't make their case. They want to bargain.
Sure, Geneva. So,
you tested the DNA from the ketamine-dealing
half brother, didn't you? The gum?
This isn't about the DNA.
It is about saving the state
a costly and time-consuming trial.
Well, there's nothing I'd rather do than save the state money.
See you in a half hour. Good-bye.
Get a good deal.
Owen? Hi. What are you...
I-I just need a minute, Will.
Okay. Um, we're not looking at
Dr. DeLaney as a suspect anymore.
No, I'm... I'm here about Alicia.
I'm sorry, I can't do this right now.
Alicia was afraid of falling in love with you.
That's why she left.
It's okay. Everything's fine.
It's... clearly not fine.
I want my sister to be happy.
You really think she was itching to start her own firm?
She and her partners are reusing paper clips.
Alicia was afraid to work beside you.
That's all.
It was easier to start hating you
than to own the feelings she had toward you.
That's why you two are in this-this...
ridiculous war.
She and Peter,
they're not set in stone.
No.
It's over.
Good-bye.
Stiles.
Hey. Did you see what Colin's sending around?
It's nasty.
What the hell? What are you doing?
Stop ratting my sister. You hear me?
Hey, I-I-I don't... I don't know what you're talking about.
My sister. Stop it.
Jeffrey, this is good news.
They want a plea bargain.
That means their evidence might not be lining up.
I'm scared. I know. It's okay.
They want to keep you scared so you take a bad deal.
You keep a poker face.
Just listen, nod,
and we'll talk afterwards, okay?
Involuntary manslaughter. Two years.
Okay, we'll think about it.
It's either that or
life in prison, Jeff.
You're 22 years old. Think about that future.
Thanks, Geneva. We'll consider it.
You want to see Italy at some point in your life,
take this deal.
Time to let us talk, Geneva.
Did you kill Dani Littlejohn?
No.
Is there any way your skin could've ended up under her fingernails?
No.
You didn't know her at all, never even met her?
Never.
Then you're innocent...
and you should reject this deal.
Okay.
No.
You have to tell me.
I reject this deal.
Good.
So why do I feel so nervous?
Because this stuff isn't meant to be easy.
So, what's this about, a new offer?
I'll call you back.
Well, not exactly a new...
Actually, yes, maybe we should call it a new one.
You should've taken that two years.
And you should've already checked the DNA on that gum.
His half brother did it.
We did check it. It's not him.
So I charged your client
with Dani Littlejohn's murder,
and I expedited his DNA.
It's a hundred percent match.
Jeffrey said he never met her,
but that is his DNA under her fingernails.
He killed that girl.
Sorry,
you'll have to wait for discovery.
Don't be upset, Will. Clients lie.
Anthony Wright Edelman.
Mr. Edelman, were you staffed as an associate
on the adoption that is the subject of this lawsuit?
I was.
And on March 6, 2013,
did you send Chief Joshua Proudfoot
of the Chippewa Nation a check for $10,000
to induce the tribe not to object to the adoption?
I did.
At whose direction did you deliver this inducement?
Alicia Florrick's.
Alicia Florrick?
Are you sure?
Yes. Mrs. Florrick told me we had to make the payment
to facilitate the adoption.
What are you doing?
I will remind Mrs. Florrick that
she is not a party to this deposition.
She's here as a courtesy.
And if she interrupts again,
she'll be asked to leave.
So Mrs. Florrick was the partner
supervising you on this matter?
That's correct.
Were you working at any other partner's behest?
No. Just Mrs. Florrick's.
You want to tell me what that was about?
Welcome back.
Thank you.
Isn't it nice?
We had a partnership position open,
so Anthony got it.
I will file a complaint with the ACDB.
I will sue you for conspiracy.
You'll do nothing but fail.
Stop ratting our computers. It's illegal.
It's... What are you talking about?
Do it again
and we'll bring charges.
Sure, whatever you say.
Good luck with your firm, Mrs. Florrick.
I'd start putting my $6 million together now.
I didn't lie.
You only hurt yourself--
you could've had two years.
I didn't lie.
I never met her.
Then how did your DNA end up...
I don't know, I...
I... I don't know.
Okay. Okay, let me see what I can do.
I'm never getting out of here, am I?
I'll ask for bail, but I don't know.
They're gonna probably transfer you to county.
And don't talk to anyone.
Cellmates are prone to snitch.
Oh, my God.
Listen.
We're going to trial.
I'll try to move fast, but it could take six months.
I need you to hold it together, okay?
Jeff, look at me.
Okay?
I'm not giving up.
Don't you give up, either.
We're trying to get our heads around the Anthony thing.
He blindsided all of us.
The question is, how much can he hurt us.
A lot. He'll dish on every strategy he was privy to.
How you doing?
Okay. Go ahead, Clarke.
Mrs. Florrick,
even without office space, you're sinking
under the cost of overhead.
Malpractice insurance, staff salaries, marketing costs...
Your fee.
Yes. Overhead.
What you need to be doing now is billing hours--
a lot of them-- and without Anthony,
your manpower crisis has worsened.
He wants us to hire him.
I'm a full-fledged member of the bar now, Mrs. Florrick,
and business expertise is something you are sorely lacking.
Mr. Hayden...
Your books are in disarray.
I will get you on your feet financially.
And he'll work for free.
Why?
Well... I like...
...the law.
Now, I will only work for free until the firm is profitable,
which I will work day and night to achieve.
Once we're in the black, then I want my salary retroactively.
Thank you.
No, we'll be thanking you.
Zach!
Zach, what happened?
Uh, nothing. I was playing baseball,
someone hit me with their elbow.
Well, you need to get ice on that.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Yeah, Stiles is a jerk, huh?
Yeah, I know.
But...
thank you.
