spanish midgets wrestling ....
julie ! okay , i see how you got there .
you ever figure out what that thing &apos;s for ?
i &apos;m trying this screening thing .
if i always answer the phone , people will think i have no life .
my god ! rodrigo never gets pinned !
at the sound of the beep , you know what to do .
hello . i &apos;m looking for bob .
this is jade .
i don &apos; t know if you &apos; re still at this number , but i was thinking ...
... about how great it was . i know it &apos;s been three years ...
... but i was hoping we could hook up again .
i barely had the nerve to make this call ...
... so you know what i did ?
what ?
i got a little drunk ...
... and naked .
bob here !
the one with five steaks and an eggplant
so what have you been up to ?
oh , you know , the usual .
teaching aerobics ...
... partying way too much .
and in case you wondered ...
... those are my legs on the new james bond poster .

i love her !
i know .
i &apos;m back .
so are we gonna get together ?
absolutely .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
do you know central perk ? say , five @-@ ish ?

having a phone has finally paid off .
you do a good bob impression ...
... but when she sees you tomorrow ...
... she &apos;s gonna realize you &apos;re not bob .
you see tattoo ....
jade &apos;s fantasy is to rekindle the love she had with bob .
my fantasy is that you talk like a normal person .
i &apos;m hoping that when bob doesn &apos;t show up ...
... she &apos;ll seek comfort in the arms of the stranger at the next table .
oh , my god . you are pure evil .
okay , pure evil ...
... horny and alone .
i &apos;ve done this .
yeah , everybody &apos;s here .
hey , everybody ! say hi to julie in new mexico !

is there any chance that you &apos;re rounding up from ...
... you know ...
... from like 20 ?
hey , we got the gift , the concert and the cake .

i know it &apos;s a little steep .
but it &apos;s ross .

what are you guys doing for dinner tonight ?
well , i gotta start saving up for ross &apos; birthday .
i guess i &apos;ll just stay home and eat dust bunnies .
can you believe how much this costs ?
do you guys ever get the feeling that ...
... chandler and those guys ...
... don &apos;t get that we don &apos;t make that much money ?
they always say let &apos;s go here , let &apos;s go there .
like we can afford to go here and there .
yes , and we always have to go to , you know , someplace nice .
and we can &apos;t say anything about it , because this is a birthday thing ...
... and it &apos;s &quot; for ross . &quot;
for ross .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m at work ...
... just an ordinary day , chop , chop , saute , saute .
suddenly , leon , the manager , calls me into his office .
they fired the lunch chef , and guess who got the job ?
if it &apos;s not you , this is a horrible story .
fortunately , it is me .
and they made me head of purchasing , thank you !
that &apos;s so cool !
anyway , i think we should go out and celebrate .
you know , someplace nice .
someplace nice .
how much you think i can get for my kidney ?
you can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t get a girl like that with conventional methods .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
she wanted to call bob . bob could be who she was meant to be with .
you may be destroying their chance for happiness .
we don &apos;t know bob .
we know me . we like me . please let me be happy .

pretty incredible , according to the message on my machine .
why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine ?

i &apos;ll start with the carpaccio , and then the grilled prawns .

it &apos;ll make everybody uncomfortable .
you can tell us .
yeah , hello ? it &apos;s us . we &apos;ll be fine .
we three ...

... sometimes you guys don &apos;t get that ....
we don &apos;t have as much money as you .
i hear you .
we can talk about that .
well , then ...
... iet &apos;s .
i guess i just never think of money as an issue .
because you have it .
good point !
so how come you guys haven &apos;t talked about this before ?
because it &apos;s always something . like with monica &apos;s new job ...
... or the whole ross &apos; birthday hoopla .
i don &apos;t want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative ....
there &apos;s gonna be a hoopla ?
basically there &apos;s the thing , and then the stuff after the thing
if it makes anybody feel better , forget the thing ...
... and we &apos;ll just do the gift .
gift ? the thing &apos;s not the gift ?
no , we were gonna go see hootie and the blowfish .
hootie and the
i can catch them on the radio .
no . now i feel bad . you wanna go to the concert .
no , look . it &apos;s my birthday ...
... and the important thing is that we &apos;re all together .
all of us .
together .
not at the concert .
thank you .
so , the ebola virus . that &apos;s gotta suck , huh ?
gee , monica . what &apos;s in the bag ?
i don &apos;t know , chandler . let &apos;s take a look .
oh , it &apos;s like a skit .
why , it &apos;s dinner for six . five steaks ...
... and an eggplant for phoebe .
we switched suppliers at work , and they gave me the steaks as a thank @-@ you .
but wait , there &apos;s more . chandler , what is in that envelope ?
by the way , this didn &apos;t seem so dorky out in the hall .
why , it &apos;s six tickets to hootie and the blowfish !
the blowfish !
it &apos;s on us . so don &apos;t worry . this is ...
... our treat .
thank you .
could you be less enthused ?
look , it &apos;s a nice gesture . it is .
but it just feels like ....
like ?
charity .
charity ?
we &apos;re just trying to do a nice thing here .
but you have to understand , your &quot; nice thing &quot; makes us feel about this big .
actually , it makes us feel that big .
i don &apos;t understand . we can &apos;t win with you guys .
if you guys feel this big , maybe that &apos;s not our fault .
maybe that &apos;s just how you feel .
now you &apos;re telling us how we feel .
we never should have talked about this .
i &apos;m gonna pass on the concert .
i &apos;m just not in a very &quot; hootie &quot; place right now .
me neither .
me too .
guys , we bought the tickets .
then you &apos;ll have extra seats for all your tiaras and stuff .
why did you look at me when you said that ?
so i guess now we can &apos;t go .
do what you want . do we always have to do everything together ?
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
fine .
all right .
we &apos;re gonna go .
it &apos;s not for another six hours . we &apos;re gonna go then .
are you ready ?
just let me grab my jacket and tell you i had sex today .
what ? you had sex today ?
it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it !
i was awesome . she was biting her lip to stop from screaming .
i know it &apos;s been a while , but i took that as a good sign .
still doing the screening ?
i had sex today .
i never have to answer that phone again .
at the sound of the beep , you know what to do .
hey , bob . it &apos;s jade .
i wanted to tell you i was really hurt when you didn &apos; t show up yesterday .
and just so you know , i ended up meeting a guy .
bob here .
so you met someone , huh ?
yes , i did .
in fact , i had sex with him two hours ago .
so how was he ?
oh , bob , he was nothing compared to you .
i bit my lip to keep from screaming your name .
well , that makes me feel so good .
it was just so awkward and bumpy .
maybe he had some kind of new style that you &apos;re not familiar with .
you have to get used to it .
there wasn &apos; t much time to get used to it ...
... if you know what i mean .
you know what ? i &apos;m not gonna be able to enjoy this .
i know . it &apos;s my birthday . we all should be here .
so let &apos;s go .
well , maybe we should stay for one song .
it would be rude to them for us to leave now .
the guys are probably having a great time .
come on , you guys . one more time .
amazing !
excellent !
i can &apos;t believe the guys missed it !
what guys ? oh , yeah .
excuse me . aren &apos;t you monica geller ?

you were my baby @-@ sitter !
oh , my god ! little stevie fisher ?

ours pretty much sucked too .
but i ran into stevie fisher . remember him ?
oh , yeah ! i used to baby @-@ sit him .
hey , how &apos;s his dad ?
good .
aside from that , the evening was pretty much a bust .
yeah , we really missed you guys .
yeah , we were just saying , this whole thing is so stupid .
we just have to really , really not let stuff like money , get like
is that a hickey ?
oh , no , i just ....
i fell down .
on someone &apos;s lips ?
where &apos;d you get the hickey ?
you know , a party or
what party ?
it wasn &apos;t a party so much as a ...
... a gathering of people .
with food and music and ...
... and the band .
you partied with hootie and the blowfish ?
yes . apparently , stevie and hootie are like this .
who gave you that hickey ?
that would be the work of a blowfish .
i can &apos;t believe it ! i can &apos;t believe this !
we &apos;re just sitting at home , trying to guess joey &apos;s fingers ...
... and you &apos;re partying and having fun and all :
&quot; hey , blowfish , suck on my neck ! &quot;
don &apos;t blame us . you could &apos;ve been there .
what ? as part of your &quot; poor friends outreach program &quot; ?
oh , great . it &apos;s work .
i don &apos;t know what to say . i &apos;m sorry we make more than you .
but we &apos;re not gonna feel guilty . we work really hard .
and we don &apos;t work hard ?
it &apos;s monica . i got a page .
it &apos;s just that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more .
and you feel like we hold you back.-yes.no
leon , wait .
guys !
i don &apos;t understand .
the steaks were a gift from the meat vendor .
that was not a kickback .
i &apos;ll just replace them , and we can forget the whole thing .

i just got fired .
here &apos;s your check . that &apos;ll be $ 4 . 1.2 .
let me get that .
you got 5 bucks ?
here comes the beep . you know what to do .
hi , it &apos;s me .
listen , bob . i &apos;m probably way out of line here .
it &apos;s been three years , and you &apos; re probably seeing someone else now ...
... but if we could have one night together , for old time &apos; s sake ....
