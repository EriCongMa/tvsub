no , i can &apos;t .
i &apos;ll see you friday when finals are over .
ok . love you , too .
oh . daniel is really working my nerves .
maybe you should end it .
but he &apos;s so hot .
and he does this thing with his tongue--
ok ! tmi .
what the hell ?
oh , come on .
what is this guy doing ? !
we don &apos;t have time for this .
my first exam is at 7 : 00 .
where are you going ?
to see what &apos;s wrong with this jerk ?
are you crazy ?
debbie ?
debbie .
oh , my god .
somebody help !
good morning .
dinner was great last night .
dessert was better .
how &apos;d you sleep ?
like a rock .
sounded like it .
all that snoring .
i do not snore .
oh ! then i must have a grizzly bear
living under my bed .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
you have a case ?
where ?
memphis .
savannah ?
no , it &apos;s ok .
we talked about this .
we have .
stop .
please ? come here .
sit down .
look at me .
what do you want me to do ?
it &apos;s the third time .
and there &apos;s probably gonna be a fourth time and a fifth .
i can &apos;t control when bad guys act bad .
baby , i want to meet your parents , i do .
but this is my job .
i know , ok ? i &apos;ve just been looking forward to this .
my folks have , too .
you &apos;re the reason they &apos;re coming .
i am allowed to be upset .
you don &apos;t deserve this .
what ?
i &apos;m just saying that you deserve to have somebody
who &apos;s there for you no matter what ,
and i &apos;m gone all the time .
wait . are you actually trying to make me break up with you ?
i &apos;d understand if you wanted to .
well , i don &apos;t .
i would come out and say so if i did ,
and i suggest that you man up
and do the same if that &apos;s what you want ,
but don &apos;t you dare make this about me .
i &apos;m not .
relationships don &apos;t just happen , derek .
they take work .
and if you &apos;re not willing to put some in ,
then that is on you , ok , not me .
savannah--
you should just go .
you should go get dressed , go to work .
you have a case , right ?
then go .
let &apos;s get started .
memphis division is reporting 3 abductions
in the last 48 hours .
michael smith , age 59,
trevor burkett , age 23,
and the latest victim , christy white , age 21 .
they were all taken from parking lots late at night .
trevor and michael &apos;s cars were left abandoned .
the third victim , christy white ,
went to a supermarket with her friend debbie martin last night .
the unsub attacked debbie first
but ultimately left her behind .
debbie was released from the hospital
this morning with a concussion ,
and what we know from the police report
is that the unsub wears a pig mask ,
and he &apos;s using a taser to incapacitate his victims .
so does this unsub just lie and wait in parking lots
for victims of opportunity ?
it &apos;s pretty bold , then , attacking two girls at once .
maybe he &apos;s on a timetable
and couldn &apos;t wait for a lone victim .
well , if he is , the distance he &apos;s traveled doesn &apos;t help .
it was over 60 miles between each crime scene .
these 3 were taken from all over west tennessee .
well , it &apos;s possible he knew them
and they were all specific targets .
why the pig mask ?
i mean , obviously he &apos;s shielding his identity ,
but is there some other meaning here ?
you know , the symbolism really runs the gamut .
pigs can stand for anything from greed and laziness
to celebration and good luck ,
not to mention the derogatory nickname for cops .
well , the other question is , what &apos;s he doing with the victims ?
no bodies were discovered .
well , he &apos;s either got a secluded disposal site
or he &apos;s got a longer @-@ term plan .
these victims could still be alive .
let &apos;s go to memphis .
what happens in mecklinburg
albert einstein said ,
&quot; in matters of truth and justice ,
there is no difference between large and small problems ,
for issues concerning the treatment of people are all the same . &quot;
trevor burkett is a senior at mecklenburg state ,
and christy white is a sophomore at ripley university .
and both students are roughly the same age ,
but michael smith is a retiree in his late 50s .
which one of these is not like the other ?
the unsub seems not to have an age or a gender preference .
so he probably wasn &apos;t driven by any sort of sexual desire .
he could be holding them all together ,
which may mean they &apos;re surrogates of some kind .
that would also explain why he left debbie martin behind .
she was african american
and the rest of his victims were caucasian .
maybe she didn &apos;t fit his parameters .
well , michael smith was the first victim abducted .
do you think it was logistical or intentional ?
either way , the first victim is usually the most significant
and michael &apos;s the odd man out .
i &apos;ll have garcia dig deeper into his history .
when we land , morgan , you and jj go talk to debbie martin .
the rest of us will get set up at the field office .
debbie , can you tell us what you remember from that night ?
it was dark , and ...
i couldn &apos;t see his face .
are you crazy ?
all i remember was the pig mask
and the taser .
did he say anything ?
no .
i saw him putting christy in the back of the truck .
help !
i screamed for help .
nobody came .
nobody came .
all right . thanks , morgan .
unsub had plenty of time to take debbie martin , too ,
but he just left her there .
so they &apos;re not surrogates .
christy white was his specific target .
which means he probably stalked christy
and was expecting her to be alone .
debbie was a hiccup in his plan , so he adjusted .
the unsub went to great lengths to stage the abductions
in rapid succession , as if they were orchestrated .
ok . garcia reviewed michael smith &apos;s phone records .
everyone he spoke to checks out ,
except for him . dr. edward calder ,
local e.r. physician .
he spoke to michael smith an hour before his abduction .
what &apos;s his story ?
he claims he was home alone the night smith disappeared ,
but not a soul can corroborate it .
we should talk to him .
no . like i told the cops ,
i was home alone watching the game .
which game ?
royals / white sox .
who won ?
i fell asleep in the seventh .
what does that have to do with mike ?
shouldn &apos;t you be out looking for him instead of talking to me ?
you were the last person to talk to him .
did you two have plans that night ?
no . why , you don &apos;t actually think
that i &apos;m responsible for this , do you ?
are you ?
you gotta be kidding .
mike is my best friend .
he &apos;s like a brother . i would take a bullet for that guy .
you didn &apos;t answer my question .
no , i had nothing to do with it .
how long have you two been friends ?
since we were 19 . we played football in college together .
is that right ? where at ?
mecklenburg state .
mike &apos;s a booster for the football team . he loves the game .
that &apos;s the school trevor goes to .
trevor and michael may know each other through the football team .
we should have garcia look deeper
into the mecklenburg state connection .
hey , what you got cookin &apos; , baby girl ?
i have some uber interesting information
about our missing college boy trevor burkett .
turns out he was president of the mecklenburg state chapter
of the beta sigma delta fraternity .
what &apos;s so interesting about that ?
two things . first of all ,
they &apos;re weirdly , strangely , a lot into pigs .
i guess it had something to do
with one of their founders being a farmer .
they had a pig party every year .
everyone wore a pig mask .
oink to the oink @-@ oink .
what &apos;s the second thing , garcia ?
this is where your bacon gets extra @-@ crispy .
a little over a year ago , a pledge named james linwood
took a leap off a roof .
let me guess .
he was drunk and / or on drugs .
ah . i see you &apos;ve been to a frat party before .
yeah , according to tox reports , he was .
i believe the technical term is &quot; hammered . &quot;
it was during one of these pig parties ,
where the pledges are hazed
and then forced to imbibe like crazy .
did the kid survive ?
negative . he sustained a fatal brain injury ,
and after his death ,
beta sigma delta lost their chapter and was shut down .
no one was charged or prosecuted , though .
i &apos;m sending all of this to your tablets now .
if the abductions have anything to do with what happened that night ,
this could be about revenge .
and the unsub could be working off some sort of hit list .
thanks , garcia .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re here ! a dream come true !
whoo @-@ hoo ! hollywood , baby . we made it !
how you like us now ?
next stop , beach .
gotta work on our tans !
i told you already .
i am so sorry .
just please let me go .
water .
oh , please .
oh , please .
you hear something ?
son , are you ok ?
it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
all right , thank you .
according to his doctor , trevor was badly tortured .
looks like he was forced to drink hydrochloric acid ,
and he was sodomized with a blunt penetrating object .
well , we &apos;re obviously dealing with a sadist .
but why leave trevor alive ?
it doesn &apos;t match the typical m.o.
yeah , if anything ,
he would have inflicted more pain
and tortured his victim to death .
that &apos;s true .
so the unsub wanted trevor to experience mental anguish .
so he disfigured him with the acid , but only to his face .
so appearance is important to him .
and the acid could be a form of poisoning .
and let &apos;s not forget a taser was used .
the unsub didn &apos;t have the physical strength
to control his victims .
ok , wait a minute . when you add up poison , cleanliness ,
and the use of a taser to overwhelm the victims ,
we can &apos;t rule out the possibility
that our unsub just might be female .
we need to give the profile .
this unknown subject is an injustice collector
who &apos;s delivering transferred vengeance .
we believe this unsub may also be a woman
and that she &apos;s on a mission
to punish those she &apos;s deemed responsible
for the death of james linwood .
the pig mask they wear is the same one worn by pledges
of the beta sigma delta fraternity ,
as a reminder of that fatal night .
we believe the victims are being tortured
as payback for their role in linwood &apos;s death .
one of the abductees , trevor burkett ,
escaped or was released
after being forced to drink hydrochloric acid .
we believe the acid symbolizes the excessive alcohol
the loved one was forced to drink the night he died .
scarring these victims will ensure
that the world never forgets what they &apos;ve done .
the unsub is exhibiting a level of sexual assault and torture
which is normally atypical for female offenders ,
but it is seen when there &apos;s been years and years
of built @-@ up rage and anger .
like los angeles cop killer christopher dorner ,
injustice collectors believe
they &apos;ve been dealt a lifetime of unfairness
and believe that nobody treats them
with the respect they deserve .
but in reality , they &apos;re simply masking insecurities and fears
by solely placed the blame on others .
this means the unsub &apos;s next target
will probably be another fraternity member
or someone who attended the party where linwood was killed .
it could also be someone from the university
whom the unsub perceives as having played a role in his death .
so we need you to warn
students , faculty , and staff at mecklenburg state
they need to stay aware and alert .
even the loosest affiliation
could be magnified in the unsub &apos;s psyche .
at this point we have to believe
that christy white and michael smith are still alive
but are undergoing severe torture .
so time is of the essence .
thank you .
sometimes after the ventilator is shut off ,
the patient may breathe on their own
for a few minutes or a few hours .
whoo @-@ hoo ! hollywood , baby . we made it !
how you like us now ?
next stop , beach .
gotta work on our ...
the last thing to stop will be the heart ,
which can keep beating for a short time
after oxygen has been cut off from the brain .
will she feel anything ?
some people have said patients make rattling sounds
when they &apos;re disconnected .
that is actually just the equipment .
if you &apos;ll sign here saying that you understand--
no !
you came to us saying you were ready .
well , i &apos;m not . ok ?
i want to be alone with her .
i &apos;m so sorry i failed you .
it &apos;s just crazy .
me and trevor were roommates ,
but to be honest , i barely saw him
after we moved out of the beta sigma delta house .
do you recognize this girl ?
her name &apos;s christy white .
she was kidnapped by the same person who took trevor .
no .
i don &apos;t .
think back to the pig party .
do you remember her being there ?
maybe .
i don &apos;t know . i was really wasted .
marcus , sometimes our subconscious picks up details
that our conscious minds aren &apos;t aware of .
do me a favor and close your eyes ?
all right . think back to that night .
the music &apos;s loud ...
it smells like beer ...
and mud .
drink ! drink ! drink ! drink ! drink ...
me and trevor were greeters .
no one could enter unless they got dirty .
who &apos;s arriving ?
a few brothers from another chapter .
welcome , ladies .
and who might you be ?
i &apos;m christy , and this is lauryn .
so where would you like it ?
on my cheek .
and , uh , how about you ?
i &apos;ll take it here .
yeah , baby ! ok !
yeah ! you roll him !
roll that pig ! roll it !
what did you say ?
i asked you where lauryn went .
i--i don &apos;t know .
was trevor with christy the rest of the night ?
i don &apos;t think so .
all right , close your eyes again .
it &apos;s a little bit later .
look around the room .
do you see christy ?
yeah . she &apos;s laughing and flirting with the d.j.
where is trevor ?
across the room , talking to christy &apos;s friend .
but then he leaves her to go talk to two guys .
i don &apos;t recognize them .
their backs are to me .
they look like upperclassmen .
then the two guys go down to the basement .
trevor goes back to talk to lauryn .
and then he takes her down to the basement , too .
why would upperclassmen be wearing pig masks at the party ?
i thought only the pledges wore them .
i don &apos;t know .
they shouldn &apos;t be .
friends of the pledge james linwood check out .
what about his family ?
parents live on the west coast . no siblings .
christy was at the party with a friend named lauryn .
trevor met christy , but he didn &apos;t spend any time with her .
she was there , though . we have a connection now .
and i don &apos;t think the pledge dying
was the only thing that happened that night .
what do you think ?
marcus witnessed something strange .
he saw trevor talking to christy &apos;s friend ,
then he saw trevor talking to two upperclassmen
he didn &apos;t recognize because they were wearing pig masks .
then he saw them all go down to the basement .
if something nefarious happened in the basement ,
the unsub could be angry about that , not the dead pledge .
maybe christy &apos;s friend lauryn knows something .
well , we know there &apos;s no statement from christy for that night ,
and there &apos;s also nothing from anyone named lauryn .
yeah , a lot of the kids ran off when the police showed up .
we need to find lauryn . she could break this case open .
do you need another minute ?
no .
sheila ...
i know this wasn &apos;t easy .
call me , anytime .
i can help with the grieving process .
thanks , but i won &apos;t be needing this .
keep it .
you may , uh , change your mind .
i won &apos;t .
i want to know everything you did that night .
what have you got , garcia ?
sir , i &apos;ve got a humongous hit .
now , there are only 6 lauryns
within a 100 @-@ mile radius of mecklenburg state ,
all of which are clean .
but you know how i love to cross @-@ check on things ,
so i did just that with christy white &apos;s
texts , emails , and social media ,
of which there are literally thousands of messages ,
and i found you
a 19 @-@ year @-@ old lauryn @-@ anne harrison ,
lauryn @-@ hyphen @-@ anne being her full first name ,
which is why she didn &apos;t show up in my initial search .
and what &apos;s her deal ?
her deal is that she took an english lit class with christy .
they &apos;ve been in touch sporadically , but their last exchange
was the night james linwood died .
why did they stop talking ?
maybe it &apos;s because lauryn &apos;s been in a coma
and hooked up to a ventilator for a little over a year .
what happened ?
heart attack and brain damage
due to severe hypothermia and alcohol poisoning .
and where is she now , garcia ?
right now she is hopefully in heaven ,
because her sister like just signed the paperwork
to have her taken off life support .
wait , her sister ? what about her parents ?
parent . susan , single mom ,
died of ovarian cancer 7 years ago .
sheila , her sister , was 18 at the time ,
so she retained custody of lauryn .
oh , bless their hearts .
the medical bills from the mom and lauryn
totally bankrupted them .
we need to find sheila .
work and home address just sent .
so this isn &apos;t about what happened to james linwood .
this about revenge for whatever happened to lauryn on that night .
morgan , you and jj take the home address , we &apos;ll take the work .
fbi !
clear .
it &apos;s clear .
was she moving out ?
if her sister &apos;s medical bills bankrupted her ,
maybe she &apos;s being forced to .
february 16th .
that was the day of the pig party .
looks like it &apos;s turned into an obsession .
or some kind of investigation .
so she lost her mom , a few years later she goes bankrupt ,
and then she loses her sister .
talk about stressors .
especially since james &apos; death was the only thing
that made the headlines from that night .
no one said a thing about lauryn .
maybe no one actually knows exactly
what happened to her .
well , she wants answers , and she thinks the victims have them .
we were drunk .
i can &apos;t remember everything .
no ?
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t , please .
don &apos;t , please !
no !
did that jog your memory , mr. quarterback ?
all right , thanks , hotch . i &apos;ll keep you posted .
sheila harrison quit her job two days ago .
that &apos;s strange ,
given her dire financial situation .
moving out , quitting her job . she could be close to her end game .
which is what ?
this right here is dr. calder , mike smith &apos;s friend .
wait . st. luke &apos;s ?
there &apos;s a stack of old medical bills from there .
so dr. calder worked at
the same hospital where lauryn was treated .
eyebrows , angel , i love you .
what do you need ?
hey , mama , i need all you got on a dr. edward calder .
well , he &apos;s been an e.r. doc at st. luke &apos;s
for the past 15 years .
all right , garcia , what was the date
that lauryn @-@ anne first checked into st. luke &apos;s ?
february 17 , 2013 .
the day after the party .
was dr. calder on duty ?
why , yes , he was .
all right , can you pull up her chart from that day ?
jj , can i pull up-- is the pope a catholic ?
uh , minor cuts and bruises , hypothermia , alcohol poisoning .
we know all this .
oh , this we do not know .
what ?
apparently she had some pretty rough sex
that night with multiple partners .
3 , to be exact .
and no raincoats .
they found dna . eew !
maybe she was raped .
uh @-@ uh . it says in the report that is was consensual sex .
we &apos;re gonna need to talk to dr. calder again .
thanks , boo .
sorry for the wait .
how dare you ?
you send the police to my job .
well , we wanted to be sure .
what &apos;s this about ?
lauryn @-@ anne harrison .
who &apos;s that ?
well , this is your signature , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is , but it &apos;s an e.r.
i get lots of cases .
yeah , but the funny thing is ,
you actually wrote two reports on her that night .
and i have the original right here .
you wrote this one 3 hours before the one you actually filed .
in the earlier report , you said
there was possible evidence of sexual assault .
but a few hours later , you changed your mind . why ?
it &apos;s a medical opinion . i &apos;m allowed to change it .
but in the later report ,
you neglected to mention the bruises on her neck .
that &apos;s not an opinion .
look , here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna go , doc .
you &apos;re gonna tell us everything you know
about what happened that night .
and if the information that you give us leads to an arrest ,
we might consider not charging you
with obstruction of justice .
i only know names ,
not details .
trevor burkett , christopher stafford ,
um ... adam richmond .
adam was a football player ,
quarterback , team captain .
mike pressured me to change the report
so he wouldn &apos;t get kicked off the team .
know why you &apos;re here , christopher ?
cops told me i was under arrest for rape .
lauryn @-@ anne harrison .
you recognize her ?
yeah .
now , we may actually have enough to convict you
for rape and homicide .
what ?
she died today .
from injuries she sustained the night of the party .
no .
your friend trevor went missing ,
and when we found him ,
this is what he looked like .
oh , my god .
the only way to help yourself , christopher ,
is to tell us exactly what happened that night .
right now .
it wasn &apos;t my idea . i swear .
they took turns .
and what about you ?
they made me .
made you . did they hold a gun to your head ?
and then what happened ?
when it was over , adam forced her
to drink a whole bottle of vodka .
drink .
why ?
to make sure she was blackout drunk ...
no , all of it . all of it .
and wouldn &apos;t remember anything that happened .
and then what did you do ?
we waited for her to pass out .
and then we got her address off her phone
and drove her home .
don &apos;t you say it like you did her a favor and gave her a lift ,
you son of a bitch .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ?
well , i am , too , and here we are .
sorry doesn &apos;t change a damn thing .
you know , she called me that night from the driveway .
when i listened to the message ,
she was so drunk , i could barely understand a word .
she just kept apologizing .
she said your names .
so i know you killed her .
and you covered it up .
according to these financial records ,
it looks like michael smith
is more than a mecklenburg state booster ,
he &apos;s also kind of shady .
how so ?
we &apos;ll , he &apos;s got a business account that makes automatic monthly transfers
to a sporting goods company called star @-@ gear ,
and that particular company supplies the mecklenburg state football team
with all their equipment .
he also purchased several cars for the players ,
in addition to paying off their dui fines and attorney fees .
that explains why he wanted to rape charges to go away .
adam richmond had to be the reason
smith got involved in the first place .
calder , the e.r. doc , knew that lauryn had been raped ,
so he called michael smith and they covered it up .
but how in the world did sheila know
who to go after in the first place ?
her sister must have told her somehow .
but how ? she was in a coma .
i &apos;ll have garcia go through the phone records again .
maybe we missed something .
and since her sister &apos;s dead now ,
she may begin to unravel .
adam richmond was just reported missing .
he was supposed to meet his football coach
and now he &apos;s nowhere to be found .
at first i wanted you to suffer .
but there &apos;s not much point in that now , is there ?
sheila probably took her victims back to where it all started .
well , isn &apos;t the old beta sigma delta house fully occupied ?
yes . and i just confirmed that the basement
was converted to a yoga studio last month .
symbolism is important to sheila , though .
she must be on or near campus .
she &apos;d want to get as close as she could to the crime scene .
and she &apos;d need a place where she could drive in
and unload her victims but remain unseen .
garcia , are there any vacant buildings within a 5 @-@ mile radius
of the fraternity house ?
checking now . i &apos;ve got a condemned house on walnut
that &apos;s scheduled to be razed for the new chemistry building ,
and there &apos;s a dormitory on the east hill
that &apos;s currently under renovation .
i &apos;m sending you both addresses now .
all right , morgan , you , dave , and jj go to the condemned house .
the rest of us will take the dorm .
your turn .
they &apos;re all pigs , but i didn &apos;t do anything .
you took her there .
how was i supposed to know what was gonna happen ?
why did you leave without her ?
she was having a good time .
i thought she met someone that she liked .
rossi .
the truth is , you decided to save your own skin .
you took off when the cops showed up , right ?
i tried to find her , but i couldn &apos;t .
well , you must have heard later that she was in the hospital .
but you never called
or came to visit .
we only had one class together .
it &apos;s not like we were best friends .
no .
no . no , no !
sheila harrison , fbi !
drop that weapon .
help me !
you come any closer , i &apos;ll put this right in her neck .
sheila , we know what happened to lauryn .
we promise you that we will get justice for her .
where were you when i tried
to tell the cops what they did to my sister ?
i know you want retribution , but this is a mistake .
the mistake is how they raped her ,
and then they threw her outside like a bag of trash .
you blame yourself for letting lauryn go to that party .
she was my responsibility .
when i got home , there she was ...
lauryn !
half dead , laying on the front lawn .
you are not responsible for what happened ,
but you can help us put away the people who are .
sheila ...
let her go .
everything all right ?
yeah .
i notice you &apos;ve been a little distracted lately .
person , place , or thing ?
person .
is it s.d.u. time already ?
s.d.--
excuse me ?
s.d.u.
she doesn &apos;t understand .
yo , she doesn &apos;t understand our schedule .
yo , baby girl , she doesn &apos;t understand how hard our job is .
i do not sound like that .
anyway , s.d.u. usually hits around the 5 @-@ or 6 @-@ month mark .
that &apos;s where you break up with a girlfriend ,
or more likely , you force her to break up with you
so you &apos;re not the bad guy .
damn , you don &apos;t pull any punches , do you ?
look , it &apos;s really quite simple .
you either want a relationship or you don &apos;t .
and if you don &apos;t , accept the fact
that you might be alone forever .
how do you and will do it ?
it &apos;s hard .
it takes a lot of effort .
but work is what makes it work .
i guess this is the part where you tell me it &apos;s worth it .
look , we &apos;re not the only ones with demanding jobs , derek .
so you need to ask yourself ,
what are you really afraid of ?
you know , i think i liked you better
when you were the press liaison .
no , you didn &apos;t .
listen , um ...
about the other day ...
look , derek , um , i don &apos;t want to pressure you into any --
look , savannah , i ...
i will do whatever it takes to be with you .
i am in love with you .
i love you , too .
ok , so your folks --
are they here yet ?
i am actually on my way to pick them up at the airport .
i &apos;ll drive .
mm ... no way .
what ? what do you mean ?
i &apos;ve seen your driving .
i &apos;m driving .
oh , so this is how it &apos;s gonna be ?
