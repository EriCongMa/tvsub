all right . quiet , i &apos;m rolling .
halloween , all hallows &apos; eve ,
the fourth night in our search for the huaka &apos;i po
the night marchers
ghost warriors who roam the islands .
something &apos;s in there .
i think we should go home .
just , uh , just a little longer , babe . i &apos;ll protect you .
wow . i feel super safe now .
you hear that ?
it &apos;s probably a ... bird or something .
this is , uh ... kulamanu heiau , a ... an ancient temple and @-@ and ...
burial ground , a sacred graveyard .
locals , uh , consider trespassing onto the grounds taboo .
there , uh ...
there have been many sightings of the night marchers up here ,
so ... even though we may anger
the spirits protecting this heiau ,
it &apos;s worth the risk .
what is this ?
hey , uh , maybe you shouldn &apos;t ...
christian !
here you go .
trick or treat !
uh , sorry ?
trick or treat ?
it &apos;s halloween ; she wants a treat .
oh , uh , i really don &apos;t have anything .
i &apos;ll bet you do .
why you just go look , you can find something .
don &apos;t look at me like that , please .
do you know how amazing you look ? you look fantastic .
okay ? it &apos;s gonna be great-- we &apos;re gonna get so much candy .
will you trust me for once , please ? thank you .
here you go . happy halloween . uh , whatever .
what is this ?
a little something for dad ?
come here , come here .
get behind me . what is this ?
what is this ? you giving alcohol to a kid ?
i told you , i didn &apos;t have anything .
hold this . listen to me .
how about six months ,
six months for distributing to a minor .
daddy , let &apos;s just go .
i &apos;m trying to be nice .
you trying to be nice ?
i &apos;m gonna show you nice in one second . don &apos;t move .
hello ?
okay , yes , i ... i &apos;ll be right there .
you are lucky . get inside , close that door . beat it . now .
i am very sorry .
i know we &apos;re supposed to go trick @-@ or @-@ treating ,
but daddy just got called to work .
okay ? so i got to go , and i got to take you back ...
i &apos;ll get my stuff !
i can tell you are just crushed ... shattered at the change of plans .
really bummed , i can see .
hey , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
no , it &apos;s fine . grace was thrilled . she hates that hotel .
i have got to find an apartment .
well , you &apos;ve found ten apartments , danny--
none are good enough .
it &apos;s called taste and standards , buddy .
go home !
i &apos;d like to . thank you .
you &apos;re forbidden to be here .
just like new jersey . sleep it off , buddy , huh ?
hey , guys .
so , we think there are two vics buried up the trail--
christian o &apos;connor and kat forester .
two amateur documentarians who were trying to film the night marchers .
what are the night marchers ?
hawaiian ghost warriors .
oh , so good , so we have our suspects .
you know what ?
hey , don &apos;t laugh .
my grandfather saw them once .
saw the ... ?
yeah .
hey , kono .
yeah ?
who found the bodies ?
roommate . over there .
she , uh , was supposed to meet them but she was running late ,
and by the time she got up there ,
they were already dead and buried .
and technically , she didn &apos;t find the bodies ,
so much as a hand sticking out of a shallow grave .
spooky .
where &apos;s weston ?
oh , she was , uh , she had to change into something more appropriate .
meaning she was wearing something inappropriate ?
no , no , no , uh , that &apos;s not what i said .
that &apos;s kind of what you said .
oh , she was wearing a costume ?
please don &apos;t tell her i told you .
you didn &apos;t tell me ; i guessed .
yeah .
right .
okay , let &apos;s get started .
oh , you told them .
they guessed .
okay .
oh , this is fascinating .
i was at a halloween party with ...
what &apos;s so fascinating ?
the party isn &apos;t fascinating--
what &apos;s fascinating is that you &apos;re not willing to tell us about it .
you &apos;re kind of being all secretive-- isn &apos;t that kind of weird ?
weird ? really ?
i &apos;m not secretive . no , it &apos;s just my private life .
and i can have a private life .
yeah .
like you all have .
why are you staring at me ?
i ... because i am just imagining ,
uh , who lori weston &apos;s alter ego might be .
uh ... mm , wonder woman ?
no .
slutty wonder woman ?
stop it , danno .
chin , what have you got ?
a search of the surrounding area hasn &apos;t turned up anything yet .
hm . okay , i don &apos;t want to state the obvious ,
but i just think that maybe we &apos;ll do better if we look where the hand is .
yeah , but we have to wait for the priest .
why ?
&apos;cause this is a heiau .
an ancient hawaiian temple .
we have to wait for the kahu to bless us
and ask for the spirits &apos; permission before we can enter .
okay , well , i just , let me just get this straight so i understand .
there &apos;s a crime scene right there .
all right , and forensic evidence is degrading as we speak ,
but we are gonna wait for a priest to tell us ...
that the magic ghost says it &apos;s okay for us to check it out .
it &apos;s their culture , danny--
you just have to respect it .
oh , that &apos;s a @-@ a beautiful thought , wonder woman ,
but i think the spirits will make an exception
so that we can catch a murderer , no ?
really ? gloves are going on ?
you &apos;re making a mistake .
well , i think i &apos;ll take my chances .
they &apos;re gonna be here soon .
i got it , all right ?
a woven leather bracelet ...
the roommate identified as the male victim &apos;s .
a lot of footprints .
ah . everybody ...
i have found an ancient hawaiian artifact .
look at that . huh ?
maybe they got a picture of their killer .
uh , evil spirits , they gonna come and curse me now , or what ?
do not .
you should &apos;ve waited for the priest , buddy .
shut up .
well , because it says utilities included , okay ?
and everybody knows that satellite television is a utility .
no ?
well , a good day to you , sir .
you &apos;re out of your mind , danny .
listen , i @-@ i &apos;ve lived in squalor for way too long.okay ?
i &apos;m gonna get what i want ,
i &apos;m gonna get want at a reasonable price ,
and i &apos;m not gonna pay any moving fees , okay ?
that does not make me crazy .
no , what makes you crazy is thinking
it &apos;s okay to trample all over a sacred burial ground .
oh , here we go.here we go .
here we go ?
i am an insensitive jerk .
i didn &apos;t say a jerk ,
but &quot; insensitive &quot; is accurate , yeah , danny .
it was a murder scene , steven .
yeah , you know what ?
you cannot treat people &apos;s beliefs like a joke .
danny , a heiau is an incredibly important part of hawaiian culture .
okay , and investigating a crime scene is very important to my job .
right , and if you want hpd to cooperate with us ,
you can &apos;t disrespect their religion , man .
how would you feel if somebody desecrated a church .
i personally would care , i would care , okay ?
but that &apos;s a good question , because guess what ?
it &apos;s not the same thing .
it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
but you don &apos;t believe in any of that anyway , right ? you don &apos;t ...
could we please not have this conversation ?
because generally , this conversation doesn &apos;t go very well .
good .
&apos;kay ?
in history , it doesn &apos;t go well .
okay , fine .
good . i mean , no afterlife , no higher power .
no nothing .
okay , okay , okay .
i think that people make stuff up
to make themselves feel better . how &apos;s that ?
wow .
don &apos;t &quot; wow &quot; me .
i &apos;m ... no , i mean it &apos;s just ...
wow .
okay , listen , okay , i believe what i see in front of my face ,
and sometimes , i don &apos;t even believe that , okay ,
but if it makes you feel any better ,
next time , i will pretend , okay ?
wow .
don &apos;t &quot; wow &quot; me !
chin , anything ?
well , the camera was recording when the murders took place ,
but it looks like our killer was camera shy .
not a single shot of him .
but we did find something interesting .
look at this .
... it &apos;s worth the risk .
what is this ?
hey , maybe , uh ...
hey , maybe you shouldn &apos;t , uh ...
that bag ...
wasn &apos;t at the scene .
christian !
yeah , i wonder what the hell was in that bag ?
there &apos;s a lot of ancient skeletal remains up there .
wait a minute . you think grave robbers ?
could be . some unscrupulous collectors would pay a lot
for the artifacts up there .
okay , so , these two kids surprise him ,
and he kills them &apos; cause he wants to keep his secret .
maybe . there could be something in this section .
something the camera picked up that we can &apos;t see right now .
kono , have fong dig through this ,
see what he can come up with .
danny and i are gonna go and talk to max .
the female vic died of blunt force trauma to the head ,
mostly likely killed by the very shovel that buried her .
the male victim had dirt and debris in his lungs .
unfortunately , he was buried alive .
you know , uh , keanu , halloween was yesterday .
you &apos;re aware of that , right ?
what ?
oh . yes , i came directly to work after a costume party .
ah , you don &apos;t secretly have this thing
where you love dressing up like you &apos;re in the matrix ?
the two concepts are not mutually exclusive .
all right , max , what do we , uh ... what do we got here ?
well , i have some good news and ...
weird news .
take a look at this .
see the marks under her right eye-- fingerprint bruising .
okay , he grabbed her face .
exactly , and when he did that , he very kindly left a print .
a nice one on the right lens .
i ran it through the system , and found a match .
man by the name of greg straithan .
nice work , max . i &apos;m impressed .
and now the weird news . our suspect , greg straithan ...
is dead .
greg straithan
nice long sheet .
burglary two , criminal trespass ,
did three years at chino in california for assault .
looks good for our suspect .
except for the part where he &apos;s not actually alive .
how did he die ?
shot and killed in his apartment last week .
his girlfriend , nikki royce , admitted to it .
she &apos;s got a history of mental illness .
they &apos;ve got her on a psych hold at okalani hospital .
okay , this says she shot him in the face .
yeah , with a shotgun .
okay , so , no dental records . right ?
no face to identify him .
with the girlfriend &apos;s confession ,
i &apos;m pretty sure they didn &apos;t print the body .
what are you getting at ?
it just seems like a really good way to fake your own death .
that is , unless you think
a dead person slapped our victim in the face .
okay , if that &apos;s the case ,
the girlfriend was definitely in on it ,
so let &apos;s go talk to her .
lori , i could use your profiling skills to determine
if she &apos;s crazy , or just acting crazy .
all right . you know , there &apos;s a big question
that we haven &apos;t asked yet .
somebody got shot at straithan &apos;s apartment .
so , if not him , then who ?
whoever it is , he &apos;s buried in straithan &apos;s grave .
i &apos;ll get the paperwork started for an exhumation .
okay , in the meantime , if straithan is alive ,
and he &apos;s been walking around all week ,
maybe our victims had some prior interactions .
kono , see if the roommate recognizes him , okay ?
i &apos;ve never seen him . sorry .
do you think he did it ?
he &apos;s , uh , someone we &apos;re looking into .
how are you handling all this ?
oh , you know . not great .
the worst part is , i lost both my roommates ,
and i &apos;m all alone .
i &apos;ve never lived by myself before .
so your @-@ your friends-- they , uh ...
they never told you about anyone threatening them
or scaring them this past week ?
well , there was that one weird guy up at the heiau .
what weird guy ?
somebody was bothering them a few nights ago .
christian tried to make him go away ,
and i guess he fell and hit his head on a rock .
kat said he was bleeding really bad .
hey .
hey .
anything ?
not yet .
i was hoping since it hadn &apos;t rained the past few days ,
we &apos;d get lucky .
did you get the warrant yet to exhume straithan &apos;s grave ?
no , i &apos;m still working on it .
if you find his blood up here ,
it &apos;ll help convince the judge he &apos;s among the living .
yeah .
mahalo , kahu .
no problem , sistah .
the kupuna like you .
you hitting pops later ?
yeah .
waves should be firing .
see you there .
all right .
kono , check this out .
that &apos;s blood .
roommate was right .
looks like someone took a nasty fall .
this isn &apos;t the first time
nikki royce has been committed for mental issues .
as a teenager , she was hospitalized with an eating disorder .
all right .
so , the , uh ... the halloween party you went to-- who threw it ?
oh , just a friend .
ah .
go by yourself ?
this is it .
don &apos;t let her get too close to you .
she is a scratcher .
listen , i said i am not going back into the chicken anymore .
you can &apos;t make me .
the chicken ?
kitchen . kitchen !
there are ... there are bugs . there are bugs .
listen , i told them ... i told them , and ...
so , nikki , we need to talk to you about greg . okay ?
look . the lights .
there &apos;s something in the lights .
it stabs you .
nikki , talk to us about greg .
no .
no , i can &apos;t . no , no . no , i can &apos;t.i can &apos;t .
we know he &apos;s alive .
you guys faked his death .
you pretend to be crazy .
and take the chance the hospital will discharge you
in a couple of years , right ?
oh , thank god . thank you .
thank you so much .
okay , no one will believe me .
all right , well , where is he ?
he comes at night and talks to me .
you &apos;ve got to tell them .
they won &apos;t believe me .
i shot him !
who did you shoot , nikki ? who &apos;d you kill ?
greg .
then he came back .
he &apos;s haunting me .
can you help me , please ?
i just want him to go away so i can get some sleep .
please ?
okay , so , your professional assessment--
is she just a great liar ?
in the course of five minutes , we witnessed aphasia ,
dermatillomania , paranoia , vivid hallucinations .
my professional assessment-- that girl &apos;s off her rocker .
yeah , a little bit , but is she telling the truth ?
did she shoot straithan ?
well , she thinks she did , but there &apos;s no way to tell
if she shot him or somebody else .
all right , listen , get danny on the phone ,
have him meet you at straithan &apos;s apartment .
and maybe forensics can tell us who she actually killed .
the apartment was available 15 minutes ago , and now it &apos;s rented ?
doesn &apos;t make any sense .
what , you trying to shake me down ?
well , i &apos;m a cop . how about that ?
hello ?
hello ? !
if you &apos;re looking for an apartment ,
i think there &apos;s one available in this building .
oh , uh , yeah , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s nice ,
but i think it &apos;s a little rich for my blood . thank you .
you &apos;ll have to take the stairs .
something is wrong with the elevator .
of course something &apos;s wrong with the elevator .
i &apos;m cursed .
oh . hey .
so , what do we got ?
well , plenty of blood to test , as you can see .
luckily , the crime scene cleaners are backed up .
we &apos;ll compare the dna from the blood splatter
to the dna from his hair .
if they match each other , greg straithan &apos;s dead .
if not , he &apos;s most likely our killer .
his landlord was just telling me about straithan &apos;s habits .
how are you ?
good .
this a two @-@ bedroom ?
yeah .
uh , straithan-- did he , uh ... he seem like the kind of guy
that would fake his own death ?
well , he certainly was secretive .
i was never sure what he did for a living .
always paid for everything with cash .
huh . this is nice , this carpet .
this rug here-- what is this ?
this berber ?
yeah .
huh . thought so .
um , did he ever seem like he was afraid ?
maybe he was hiding from somebody ?
oh , i don &apos;t think so . he was a pretty intimidating person .
this is very nice . italian marble .
you know , uh , by law , you know ,
you &apos;re gonna have to disclose that there was a murder here .
you &apos;ll probably have to cut the rent in half .
you think ?
yeah , at least . i mean , most people--
they won &apos;t even rent a place where there &apos;s been a violent crime .
bad mojo , stuff like that .
me , personally-- i don &apos;t mind a little bit of blood .
okay , chin just got the warrant to dig up straithan &apos;s grave .
all i can tell you is ,
the last time i saw that casket , he was in there .
all right , but are you certain it was greg straithan &apos;s body ?
i only know what i was told .
i &apos;m not gonna get in trouble for this , am i ?
you &apos;re manipulating a landlord into renting you
a dead guy &apos;s apartment at a cut rate.is that right ?
absolutely .
that &apos;s interesting .
it &apos;s the move , babe .
i mean , all the homicide detectives back home have the nicest pads .
i &apos;m telling you .
let me just go on record by saying
i think it &apos;s wrong to disturb someone &apos;s final resting place .
okay . noted on record .
now crack it open .
okay . wait a minute .
this gravesite was undisturbed ?
is there any sign anybody could have messed with this ?
no , not a thing .
then i am completely at a loss as to how to explain this .
well , i have either good news or bad news ,
depending on where you stand .
your dead suspect is , in fact , dead .
well , what &apos;d you find ?
well , the two dna samples
from greg straithan &apos;s apartment--
the blood from the murder scene
and his hair from his brush-- they matched .
okay , so unless straithan reanimated as a zombie ,
he is definitely and simply dead .
well , considering his head wasn &apos;t intact ,
reanimating as a zombie would be completely impossible .
right .
now , for the curveball .
the blood that kono found at the heiau--
well , it belonged to an unknown subject .
didn &apos;t match straithan ,
the victims or anybody in the system .
okay , well , chances are that blood belongs to our killer .
hey . it &apos;s kono .
fong found something on the camcorder .
she &apos;s on her way to see him now .
i started by isolating the footage
from the point the camera goes airborne .
took some doing , but after demultiplexing
and deinterfacing the segment ,
i was able to enhance and highlight the individual frames .
that &apos;s the duffel bag .
camera went right over it .
good news is ...
the bag was open .
that look like a hand to you ?
yeah , and i bet it belongs to greg straithan .
that would explain
how his fingerprint showed up on the victim .
he wasn &apos;t at the heiau , but his fingers were .
so kat gets knocked over ,
she falls face @-@ first into the bag ,
fingerprint transfers onto her glasses .
what i can &apos;t explain is how his hand ended up
five miles from where he was supposed to be buried .
it &apos;s because the killer
wasn &apos;t stealing anything from the heiau .
he was hiding something .
i bet i know where the rest of straithan is .
thanks , fong .
oh , great . there &apos;s gabby .
did you know she was going to be here ?
&apos;cause you should have told me if you did .
did not , but , uh , that &apos;s not going to help you , bud .
you should just be yourself . be yourself .
hey , gabby .
what are you doing here ?
um , the burial council sent me to ensure the iwi is protected .
right . right . the iwi .
that &apos;s the bones .
i know that .
protecting the cultural significance
of this site is , uh ...
it &apos;s extremely important to daniel .
yeah .
don &apos;t you have someone to , uh , go shoot ?
nope . nope .
hey , i heard you guys had a lovely dinner .
uh @-@ huh . we did .
we ... it was ... it was lovely . it was good .
i had a great time . yeah .
hey , um , grace really wants to go to the museum ,
and , uh , i thought maybe i could bug you for a private tour . so ...
i would love to meet grace .
good .
uh , dr. asano , we &apos;re planning
on using ground @-@ penetrating radar
to locate straithan &apos;s remains .
it utilizes high @-@ frequency em waves
to see beneath the ground .
that way , we won &apos;t have to indiscriminately dig everything up .
i &apos;m sure the council will be grateful for your efforts . good .
danny ! somebody threw a rock through your window .
yeah , i know . it happened the night of the murders , chin .
keep up , babe .
no , bruddah .
the other one .
how does this even happen ?
well , maybe it &apos;s the consequence of dismissing
an entire culture &apos;s spiritual beliefs .
oh , right , a ghost .
a ghost busted my windows . that really what you believe ?
well , what we believe ,
danny , is that our ancestors are here with us ,
just as much as they were when they were alive .
you ... okay . okay .
let me ask you a question .
hpd , they secured this area , correct ?
correct . they closed the access road down
the night of the murder .
okay . so let &apos;s just imagine for a moment
that a living , breathing human being did this to my car .
i know it &apos;s crazy .
let &apos;s just imagine it .
how is it that somebody got here , came in ,
left , nobody said anything , twice ?
go ahead .
he never left .
the homeless guy .
that homeless guy told us not to come in here the night of the murder .
it would explain the roommate &apos;s story about the man
who accosted the victims a few nights prior .
all right , so what are we saying ?
our killer lives here ?
i know where i would hide .
you know , if i was homeless ,
living in hawaii , there &apos;s about 96,000 places
i &apos;d choose to live before this one .
it &apos;s private .
natural protection from the elements .
access to the heiau .
okay .
you know , it &apos;s really easy to get lost in here .
he probably knows exactly where he &apos;s going .
you just need to know where to look .
well , that helps me .
ancient hawaiian burials
tend to be no more than a meter deep .
okay . so anything above
or below this marker is most likely our guy .
oh , got something here .
what is that , about two meters down ?
looks like we found the rest of greg straithan .
whoa . hold on . there &apos;s another one
on the other side of the field .
what
two and a half meters down .
i thought there was only one body .
supposed to be .
looks like multiple hits here .
you have three or four down there .
i got something !
okay , i &apos;m going to need a radio .
steve , we &apos;ve got more than one body down here .
say again .
it &apos;s looking like dozens all over the heiau .
i &apos;ve seen something like this before .
it might be the dumping ground of a serial killer .
i got blood .
lot of it .
i got the white bag from the video .
and it &apos;s empty , danny .
all right ! hands up .
put your hands up right now .
drop the weapon .
i warned you not to come here .
drop the weapon right now .
get on your knees .
on your knees .
on your knees .
hands behind your head . interlock your fingers .
you angered the spirits .
i know . that &apos;s what i keep hearing .
let &apos;s go .
your name is samuel lee .
you &apos;re a combat veteran .
vietnam .
how long you been homeless , samuel ?
all right .
we &apos;re testing this bag right now .
it had a severed hand in it .
you want to tell us how it got in there , help yourself out ?
no . it was empty when i found it .
it was contaminating the heiau .
quite a nasty gash you got on your forehead .
want to tell me how it happened ?
keep in mind ... i already know the answer .
they were trespassers .
too many people .
too many people treading on the iwi of the tupuna .
you attacked these two kids .
and they fought back ,
and you fell down , hit your head on a rock .
is that what you mean ?
they were desecrating the aina .
so you beat them to death with a shovel ?
no !
i warned them to stay away .
like i warned you .
but they ... they wouldn &apos;t listen .
do you always protect the heiau ?
it wants me to protect it .
it needs me to keep its secrets .
just like it keeps your secrets , right , samuel ?
i mean , it &apos;s the perfect place to dump a body .
no one would ever dare look there .
no . no , the land is sacred .
kapu .
they &apos;re ... they &apos;re being punished .
by the evil spirits
and blah , blah , blah .
what about the rock that hit my window ?
was that an evil spirit , too ? no , i think that was you .
you needed to learn respect !
what happens to people that don &apos;t respect the heiau ?
they open the door .
the dead will be looking for you now .
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s clearly disturbed but i don &apos;t like him for this .
it &apos;s not the like ,
i mean , he uh , had the bag from the crime scene ,
he admits to jumping those kids , and he &apos;s obsessed
with keeping people out of the heiau .
all right , which begs the question--
would he ever dig it up to bury bodies ?
i don &apos;t thk so . plus , if we &apos;re looking
for a serial killer , we &apos;re looking
for someone organized , meticulous .
samuel does not fit the profile at all .
i &apos;m not convinced it is a serial killer .
i mean , where does greg straithan fit in ?
we know who killed him , right ? nikki royce .
why would a serial killer bury
an already dead body in his dumping ground ?
i think we can explain .
all told , there were 32 different victims
dismembered and buried at the heiau .
they all died within the past two years .
we &apos;ve already identified three of them
through the dna database-- james yamamoto ,
chuck anderson and emma kirkland .
but here &apos;s the interesting part .
emma died in a car accident ,
chuck had a brain aneurysm ,
and james died of a heart attack .
anyone care to venture a guess
as to what they all have in common ?
well , none of them were murdered .
exactly .
meaning we don &apos;t have a serial killer on the island .
now , every single body had a specific part missing .
very precise surgical work .
whoever did this definitely had medical experience .
okay , well , that ... i mean , that rules out
samuel lee completely .
plus , the blood you guys found on his machete
and at his campsite-- wild boar .
he &apos;d just killed dinner .
okay , so what parts were missing exactly ?
the ligaments and tendons from major joints--
the elbows , knees , wrists--
were all removed postmortem .
on a hunch ,
i had fong test the duffel bag
for evidence of liquid nitrogen .
all over the inside of the bag .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
well , liquid nitrogen is utilized by biotech firms
to freeze donor tissues .
most of the organs have to be harvested from living bodies .
however , there are some tissues that can be harvested
from cadavers up to 48 hours after death .
okay , so our guy steals dead bodies ,
cuts off the parts that he needs ,
and then dumps the bodies back in the heiau
where no one will look .
exactly .
we &apos;re not looking for a serial killer .
we &apos;re looking for a businessman
who &apos;s selling cadaver parts on the black market .
hpd has no active investigation
into the body parts trade .
however , nationwide it &apos;s a booming business .
cadaver tissue can be used
in anything from acl surgery to filling in wrinkles .
they make a profit by giving the tissue away
but charging huge shipping fees .
i mean , an acl alone can cost five grand .
we also found another commonality
between the three identified bodies .
they all had their funerals
and burials at the same place :
makaha memorial park and mortuary .
might sound familiar to you--
that &apos;s where we dug up straithan &apos;s casket .
okay , well , that &apos;s how he &apos;s getting his hands on the bodies .
he intercepts them before they go in the ground .
and according to the families , our friendly
neighborhood mortuary attendant is the one
who helped them through their grief .
his name &apos;s tyler mitchell .
no wonder he was so unhappy
about us exhuming straithan &apos;s grave .
he knew it was empty all along .
he &apos;s got a record--
extortion and fraud .
if he killed kat and christian ,
we can add murder to that list .
tyler mitchell , five @-@ o.
moving .
move .
mitchell &apos;s car is still out front .
he &apos;s working late .
he &apos;s got a lot of bodies to hack up .
okay , we need to split up .
chin , take the second floor .
i &apos;ll go around the back .
lori , get the basement .
i got this floor . be careful .
got it .
oh , my god .
steve , i found tyler mitchell ; he &apos;s dead .
don &apos;t bother with the ambulance ; it &apos;s way too late for that .
i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s been embalmed alive .
whoever killed him ...
lori ?
lori .
hey , lori , hey .
you all right ?
yeah .
easy , easy , easy , don &apos;t move so fast , take it easy .
ah , damn it , he got the drop on me , sorry .
don &apos;t say sorry ; he could have killed you .
you okay ?
yeah , yeah .
you sure ?
steve , don &apos;t look so concerned .
i &apos;m fine .
really , i &apos;m fine .
hey , danny &apos;s checking it out ,
but it looks like the son of a bitch got out using a service elevator .
he &apos;s gone .
embalmed alive--
not how i want to go out .
guess it looks like tyler &apos;s not our killer .
no , but he was working with him .
found these client files .
now , i think our killer was actually trying
to get rid of evidence , but lori interrupted him .
didn &apos;t get everything , though .
wait , wait , what evidence ?
his body supplier , for one .
and the fact that all the bodies
came out of kapana general .
all signed out by the same charge nurse--
jacob garrison .
kono , what do you got ?
sending over garrison &apos;s dmv photo now .
all right , i got it .
he &apos;s been charge nurse at kapana general for about four years .
financials were a mess until recently--
credit card and student loan debt totaling over 100 grand--
and then six months ago , he pays everything off .
that &apos;s a lot of tendons .
send hpd over to kapana general .
already done .
supervisor said garrison skipped his shift today .
he &apos;s not at home either .
however , a year ago ,
he bought a piece of property out near barber &apos;s point .
very nice , nice and remote .
perfect place to hack up bodies .
moving .
go .
you smell that ?
some sort of chemical .
that &apos;s formaldehyde--
it &apos;s highly flammable and it &apos;s everywhere .
drop it !
put your hands where we can see them !
put your hands where we can see them !
garrison .
hey , hey , hey , don &apos;t do it , don &apos;t do it .
get away from me .
just close the lighter , garrison , close the lighter .
just close the lighter , okay , close it .
hey , no , no , no .
hey , garrison , don &apos;t do it . okay ?
close the lighter ,
garrison , just close the lighter .
garrison , no , no , no !
run , run , everyone out now ! go , go , go !
you okay ?
yeah .
seriously , uh , all you have is paper or plastic ?
yeah , well , that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s the old me .
the new me is going to buy a steak knife .
maybe even a pot ,
maybe a pan .
hey , this is the last of it .
what are you , some sort of monk ?
you hardly have anything .
you ... are not done .
here you go .
what &apos;s this for ?
this is a paintbrush and this is a can
of lavender tulip for grace &apos;s bedroom .
please don &apos;t get anything on the baseboards .
thank you .
this is a very large mattress .
what you planning on doing on this very large mattress ?
please , please watch the walls , boys .
second bedroom on the left .
trust you to find the only mattress place
on the island that doesn &apos;t deliver .
only you could do that .
no , no , they , they deliver .
it just costs an extra 50 bucks .
you only cost me a beer .
welcome .
just the last of the paperwork to sign .
all right , um , everything looks great , by the way .
oh , good .
yeah .
um , i was going to ask you about a pet deposit ,
if , uh , i need to put that because my daughter--
she wants a dog .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , we have a strict no pet policy .
what are you talking about ?
what about the old lady ?
what old lady ?
the old lady with the big dopey hat and the little dog ,
and she was gardening .
she &apos;s the one who told me the elevator was busted , which ,
by the way , you &apos;re gonna fix , right ?
it sounds like you &apos;re describing mrs. kekoa .
okay , mrs. kekoa .
well , mrs. kekoa died five years ago .
she fell down the elevator shaft .
okay .
bed &apos;s all , uh , set up .
what else ?
yeah , we &apos;re , we &apos;re gonna , we &apos;re gonna leave .
what ?
