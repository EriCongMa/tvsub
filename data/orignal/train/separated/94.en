First time?
Excuse me?
Um, is it your first time voting?
Uh, yes.
Your name?
Zach Florrick.
Why, you have the same last name as one of the candidates.
Really?
I know what it's like.
My last name is Eisenhower.
Uh, do you need any help?
I think I should be fine. Thank you.
迈克·克里斯特瓦
Excuse me, ma'am.
Uh, did you see that ballot box over there in the corner?
Uh, no, you put your ballot in here.
Yes, I know. I just...
There's a ballot box over there with a broken seal.
Ballot boxes are supposed to be sealed,
and the seal's ripped.
Are you sure?
Yes.
What's up, Nana?
Uh, this young man
thinks there's a problem with a ballot box.
Excuse me. What are you doing?
Taking a picture.
Well, you can't do that.
Take a picture? Of course I can.
No, no, it's actually illegal.
It's only illegal if you're taking a photo of someone who's voting.
There's no one voting.
Excuse me.
I am the polling monitor here,
and I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
We're still confident, Your Honor.
The polls have us neck and neck.
It's just gonna all come down to our get-out-the-vote...
Eli,
I want Cristian to be on the stage with us.
He's family.
Yeah, whatever.
Alicia, hold on. I'm having trouble hearing you.
Eli, what did my mother just say to you?
Oh, she wants her helper on the dais.
Peter, we may be having trouble with early voting.
I don't want Cristian on the dais.
What?
Peter, is this really important?
God.
Everybody out.
Come on! Out, out, out. Out!
Go downstairs. Come on! Nora, get these people out of here.
Put that down.
So what did Zach see?
Zach was early voting in the 43rd Ward,
and he may have seen a stuffed ballot box of Kresteva votes.
Why does he think it was stuffed?
Because the ballot box had a ripped seal.
He thinks it was a ripped seal or he knows it was a ripped seal?
He took a picture.
I'm looking at it now.
Alicia, tomorrow's Election Day.
All our lawyers are downstate.
Can you ask Diane to take this?
I think she's at dinner. You want me to call Will?
No. Diane is incentivized.
If Peter doesn't win...
Right, she doesn't get the judgeship. Okay, I'll call you back.
Okay.
Kresteva is trying to steal this election, and we have to stop him.
Okay.
Where are you worried about the most Kresteva votes?
Addison Township. 41st Ward.
Uh, what are you doing?
I'm gonna take care of it.
You want to know how?
No. I don't know. Do I?
It's ten hours till the polls open.
I have a septic truck ready.
I'm gonna park it in front of the main precinct in the 41st
and... accidentally spill it.
Okay?
This is perfect. Wow.
My office here.
Conference room there. I love it.
How much is it?
$60 a square foot.
We're not gonna find much cheaper in the Loop.
Not if we want to move in in two weeks.
Well, we can't afford $60 a square foot.
We can if we reduce our upfront salary costs.
Okay, and how do we do that?
Kalinda.
We all agreed.
We pay her ask. That's the only way she'll come with us.
We changed our minds.
Look, guys.
Kalinda wins cases.
We split off from Lockhart/Gardner,
we need to win. That's how we grow.
Maybe there's someone else who can win cases cheaper.
And maybe there's someone who can win cases
and pay us, but that's unlikely.
That's Diane.
I have to go.
Ask Kalinda if she'll take a commitment to bump up
in the second year.
I'll see you guys down in the bar in an hour.
Judy, stop it right now or we'll all be yawning in a minute.
I'm Judge Abernathy.
I'm the magistrate on call for electioneering disputes.
Well, what is the issue, Counselor?
We have some question about the provenance of ballots
we discovered in early voting.
And we ask for emergency relief before voting is concluded
in approximately 21 hours.
And you, sir,
you are here to represent the interests of the Kresteva campaign?
No, I am, Your Honor.
Apologies for my lateness.
The campaign just asked me to step in.
And who better to argue at an all-night session
than a mother who would be up anyway?
You can go now.
Welcome, ma'am. And I see that
you have some... uh, accoutrements with you.
Yes, my babies, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, but I have to breastfeed the little one
or she won't sleep through the night.
Okay. Just...
try to keep them quiet, okay?
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.
Could you please tell us what you saw tonight
at the 5th Precinct in the 43rd Ward.
Yes.
I saw an unsealed box of votes being carried in
and placed in the corner.
And did you happen to take a picture of those ballots?
Yeah, with my cell phone.
Sorry, Your Honor.
No. That's quite all right. We'll just wait.
So, Zach, this photo that you took,
is that the ballot box seal ripped?
It is.
I tender the witness.
Just be honest.
So...
Zach Florrick,
what did your mother whisper to you just now?
She whispered, "Just be honest."
I see.
So she was afraid you wouldn't be?
Objection, Your Honor,
I gave my son the same advice I would give any first-time witness.
Withdrawn.
Now, Zach, have you ever been arrested?
Objection. Relevance.
Goes to character.
My son was pulled over once,
but the prosecutor dropped the charge
Excuse me, Your Honor. I'm questioning a witness,
not his mother.
Yes, Mrs. Florrick, please.
Why were you arrested, Zach?
For recording a police officer.
Taking his picture.
So... this would be the second time in eight months
you've seen something you thought corrupt and took a picture?
Sure.
Seems to happen a lot to you?
Well, it's happened twice.
I don't know if I'd call that "A lot."
This last time you were pulled over for drug possession.
A charge that was dropped.
Mrs. Florrick.
I was pulled over, but I wasn't carrying drugs.
The policeman seemed to disagree.
The policeman was wrong.
Do you question authority a lot?
No. Only when it's wrong.
Yes, I saw him taking pictures, and I told him to stop.
And he said he wouldn't,
so I threatened to call the police.
And this photo he took,
you're saying those were not unsecured ballots?
That's correct, they were ballots from earlier in the week.
But he said he saw a man bring them in.
Well, that was one of the, uh... the poll workers.
I asked him to move them.
I see.
I think young Mr. Florrick may have a tendency to exaggerate.
Objection!
My goodness.
Ms. Lockhart, good evening.
You've decided to join our little slumber party?
I have, Your Honor.
You couldn't keep me away.
Sorry. My sciatica is acting up.
I have to walk every 20 minutes or my doctor yells at me.
Would you like me to take a pause?
No, no, no. Keep going. I can hear.
Just one more question, Mr. Buckley. Um...
why was this ballot box unsealed at all?
Well, I tried to lift it, and I accidentally...
I-I ripped the seal.
Oh. Nothing further.
Mr. Buckley,
you are a registered Republican, isn't that correct?
It is.
Though I'm not sure what that has to do with this.
You want Mr. Kresteva to win.
Objection, Your Honor. Uh...
Uh, Mr. Buckley's candidate preference is not an issue.
I would agree. Sustained.
Your honor, by all accounts,
this will be a very close election.
Some polls suggest 1,000 votes will determine
whether Peter Florrick
or Mike Kresteva is governor.
And so we ask that this box be impounded by the court...
Your Honor, this is not a police state.
Until such time as their provenance can be determined.
And if the vote count suggests,
a one-sided count in favor of Mr. Kresteva,
we would argue that fraud charges be brought.
Your Honor, this is a blatant attempt...
Your Honor,
we have less than 24 hours before the polls close.
Okay. Time out.
Five-minute recess.
We need you to look into the provenance of these ballots.
Quickly. Now. Cary,
look into the background of this Republican monitor.
Any connection to Kresteva.
Got it. Kalinda.
Kalinda, we need to talk.
We can't pay your ask.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just listen to me.
You have the chance to get in on the ground floor of something.
Cary, please, don't sell me.
Within a year, we will prom...
Good evening.
Hi. Will.
Within a year, we'll promise you ten percent more
than Lockhart/Gardner.
You give me five percent of all profits
for the first three years.
You want me to get excited about the ground floor idea,
five percent, no overhead, clean.
Hi, Patti. It's odd you're in on this.
The pharmaceutical industry likes Kresteva over your boy.
Is this a new one?
I don't know. I've lost track.
You can call me Nana Joe.
I love your beret.
I took it off out of respect.
No, put it on.
Thank you, Nana Joe.
That is a lovely beret.
Mr. Buckley said that he acci...
Uh, just keep going.
Mr. Buckley said he accidentally... ripped the box's seal
when he tried to move it. Is that correct?
I was there all day and I didn't see him move from his office.
But you did see someone enter your polling place with the box?
I remember because I thought he was a voter.
And then I saw this big box in his arms.
Thank you, Nana.
Good luck crossing Grandma Moses.
Hi, Nana Joe.
When was the last time you had your eyes checked?
Oh, I don't know.
A few months ago.
And can you see all the way back to that door back there?
Yeah, I guess.
So, if I walk back here...
Your Honor, object...
Objection.
This kind of stunt went out with Perry Mason.
And yet, I enjoy it every time.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Nana Joe,
how many fingers am I holding up?
Uh, it looks like, uh, three. Mm.
Actually, it's two.
Thank you, Nana Joe.
And thank you for your service to the city.
Nana Joe,
when this man entered the polling place,
was he as far away as that door?
Well, just at first,
but then he came right past me.
Past you?
Closer than I am?
A little closer.
This close?
Little closer.
This close.
And how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
Thank you, Nana.
Uh, I have good news for everyone.
We have located the ballot box in question.
45s-721.
Your Honor, we ask that these ballots be immediately counted
to determine whether a fraud...
The sanctity
of the voting booth must not be breached, Your Honor.
We're not breaching it, we're determining how many votes...
I am not going to allow another Gore v. Bush.
Well, I have some good news
the votes have been counted.
There are 30,843 total.
That is a considerable chunk for such a small polling place.
How many votes are for Kresteva?
2685.
26,000?
No, 2,600.
Yes. That's a surprise.
The rest are for Florrick. 28,158.
We... Your Honor, um...
Would you like to change your motion?
Yes, we-- actually, we are going to withdraw the motion
out of respect for the voting process.
We'd like to make a motion, Your Honor.
Of course you would.
These ballots are fraudulent and should be thrown out.
That's five percent, Cary.
Right, but if we make nothing,
Kalinda makes nothing.
I've been watching Lockhart/Gardner make all the same mistakes:
overpromising.
We said we shouldn't overextend ourselves...
We aren't!
Their mistake was committing money they didn't have.
Maybe you're a little too close to this, Cary.
What does that mean?
You have no objectivity about Kalinda.
I have just as much objectivity as anyone.
No. We haven't slept with her.
Okay.
Uh, I think this is going off the rails a bit.
Is that Colin Sweeney?
What does he want?
Mr. Agos.
I wanted to toast your new venture.
My new...
Yes, your little rebellion.
It's in the air.
Like Les Mis rables.
Did you see that musical?
Vive la resistance, eh?
I'm not... I'm not sure...
I own the building.
My manager told me you were considering a lease.
What are you looking for, Mr. Sweeney?
I want a discount on my legal services.
You can have 20% savings on my office space,
and I get two years of free, unlimited legal work.
Work it out.
It's a good deal.
Alicia's not coming with us.
The voters have spoken.
Exactly.
That is the point, Your Honor.
No, where did these votes come from? Out of the blue?
Ms. Nyholm has just spent the last two hours
arguing the opposite.
As has everyone.
If the preponderance of the votes were for Kresteva,
it would be fraud.
Well, the preponderance of the votes are for Florrick...
Your Honor, I know Ms. Nyholm
thinks she can shout her way to a positive result...
No, I'm not shouting,
I'm making my point clearly...
There were 30,843 ballots.
28,158 were for you, Peter.
Do you think they'll be thrown out?
I don't know.
Diane and Will are arguing to keep them.
Will is arguing?
Yes.
They're doing their best,
but we just spent two hours arguing the opposite.
We need those votes.
All of them. We think it's that close.
I know.
We're trying.
Okay, hon, I'll see you in a little bit, okay?
Okay, see you later.
You. You.
You think she knows I'm losing?
I've dedicated my life to not predicting what Jackie knows.
Jim. Is there any way we can make up those 30,000 votes?
Yeah. Maybe in the 18th Ward.
What kind of walk-around money you got?
I'll go find out.
Jim, I want you to do me a favor.
My mother's nurse, Cristian Romero--
I want you to check him out.
Sure.
Financial, criminal, personal?
Everything.
I want to know if he's using my mom.
But you swear that these ballots
are the result of early voting over the last week?
Yes.
And, sir, you are Republican?
Yes, I am still a Republican.
And therefore,
it is not in your interest to have these votes benefit a Democrat?
Mr. Buckley,
is it true that you
wrote an essay for The American Spectator criticizing Mitt Romney?
So, your eyesight is perfectly fine, Nana,
and you saw a suspicious man carrying in these ballots?
Objection. She didn't say "suspicious."
Was the man suspicious, Nana?
Yes, a bit.
You saw a suspicious man carrying in ballots?
And you have no reason to lie here today.
Nana Joe...
Do you take the prescription medicine memantine?
Yes.
And why do you take this medicine?
My doctor told me to.
But it's an Alzheimer's medicine, isn't that correct?
I'm not showing the symptoms.
So, then, why do you take it?
I told you,my doctor said.
Nana, when's your husband's birthday?
Uh... you don't know, do you?
I'm checking my datebook.
Yes, but off the top of your head, you don't know.
Isn't it possible, ma'am,
that you forgot that Mr. Buckley told you
he wanted the ballots moved...
I don't forget things.
Things like your husband's birthday?
I just want to go home.
Can I go home?
Can you remember your address?
Objection, Your Honor.
He's badgering...
It's a fair question, Your Honor.
So, Zach, you were just being a good citizen
when you took pictures of the cop who pulled you over?
I guess.
And this cop was later fired
for his activities?
I didn't know that.
He was.
You were instrumental
in getting a crooked cop off the streets.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Don't be humble.
Your mom must be very proud of you.
And you definitely saw
these ballots being carried in off the street
and not moved from one place to another in the polling place?
Well...
You do know the penalty for perjury?
Objection.
Uh, yes.
Uh, can we all just assume that witnesses know they shouldn't lie?
Yes, thank you, Your Honor.
Just a simple question, Zach.
Do you believe these unsealed ballots
came in off the street?
Yes.
Thank you,
Zach, for being honest.
I know there must be a lot of pressure on you not to.
Anything from the defense?
I'll do it.
No, I will.
Zach, how long were you in the 5th Precinct polling place?
About ten minutes.
And did you see what happened in the precinct
in the time before you arrived or the time after?
No.
So you had no way of knowing
where these men carrying the ballot box came from originally?
Yes. That's true.
And you had no way of knowing
whether these men received orders from Mr. Buckley or not?
That's right.
So it's not lying to acknowledge the limits of your own testimony?
That's right.
And so do you know if these ballots were fraudulent or not,
or if the seal on the ballot box was ripped
accidentally or never attached?
I have no way of knowing.
Good. Thank you, Zach.
And so, if there's nothing further, I...
Okay.
Uh, we need to put a pause in these proceedings.
It appears that there is now a matter being adjudicated
in the federal court which will make this matter moot.
In the federal court? What is it?
An injunction on the ballot as a whole.
From which campaign?
Uh, the third party.
Go to the suite.
I'll meet you after we deal with this.
We'll come with you.
No. Zach, I don't know how long this will go,
and I don't have time to argue.
I'm gonna call Dad and tell him you're coming.
Will, wait up.
Wait, Mom, come with us. We'll take you.
No, I'm fine. Go, Grace.
Hello?
Alicia, how are you?
Who is this?
I'm hurt. You really don't know?
Mr. Sweeney?
It's 1 A.M.
Colin Sweeney? What does he want?
Look, Mr. Sweeney, I'm a little busy.
Yes, campaign night. Congratulations.
I voted for your husband.
Can-can we talk tomorrow?
No.
I think you should join Mr. Agos in his new firm.
What does he want?
Uh, nothing. A case.
Oh, are we keeping things from our betters?
I'm thinking of moving my business with Mr. Agos.
That's $22 million a year.
You don't want to lose out on that, do you?
Mr. Sweeney, this is not neither the time...
Yes, I know you're a partner now, Alicia,
but it's a smart move.
Go with the up and coming.
That was abrupt.
Yeah, he was going on.
Okay, let's start again.
If you don't mind.
Come on in. We just started.
Please continue, sir.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm campaign manager for third-party candidate Albert O'Dell,
and I have evidence that this election's a fraud.
The problem is the ballot used in early voting.
My candidate's name is Albert O'Dell.
And the ballot left out the apostrophe,
as you can see right there.
I'll argue this one, you argue the next?
Agreed.
Your Honor,
the third-party candidate has been polling at 3.2 percent.
Mr.... - Karahalios.
Eh... the third-party campaign manager
is suggesting the disenfranchising of 800,000 early votes
all because of a missing apostrophe?
That is ridiculous.
In your opinion.
Is that in your opinion?
Oh. Um, uh, yes.
Uh, in my opinion. Of course.
Yes, Mr. Karahalios, I'm not sure
a typo rises to the level of a civil rights matter.
My candidate is
counting on the Irish vote, Your Honor.
You lose the apostrophe,
and the Irish "O'Dell"
suddenly becomes the English "Odell."
Illinois is 15% Irish. In my opinion,
this typo's the difference between winning or losing.
I hate to break it to you, buddy,
but you're the third party.
You're gonna lose.
and, yes, that's my opinion.
Okay, we got an apostrophe problem.
I'm awake.
We need arguments why the judge should allow
this third party's misprint in the early voting ballots.
Anything you can find, anyone you can wake up.
Cary? Do you want me
to tell the partners you're leaving?
Excuse me?
Stop stealing my clients,
or so help me, Cary, I'll tell them.
Alicia, I don't know what you're talking about.
I got a call from Colin Sweeney.
Yes, that's right.
Sweeney, my client.
No. Alicia, he approached me.
He did not approach you.
We were looking for real estate.
He said he'd give us a 20% discount for free legal work.
I'd never approach him, Alicia.
I'd never steal one of your clients. Never.
Hi. Sorry.
Robyn, we're talking.
Yeah, um, but I have something on the misprint.
What?
A friend of mine-- she works for the third-party campaign.
And she says Albert O'Dell is Jewish.
O'Dell is not his real name.
Good. We can run with that.
Thanks, Robyn.
You're welcome.
Robyn?
How are you liking it at Lockhart/Gardner?
Your Honor, before you decide on this matter,
we have new information.
What is that?
If I may address Mr. Karahalios.
What is your candidate's full name?
Albert Seamus O'Dell, with the apostrophe.
And who is Albert Steinman?
I don't know. Who are you referring to?
Mr. O'Dell's real name before he changed it.
Certainly within his legal rights to change his name.
But he has no actual Irish roots, correct?
Just because you have a name that doesn't sound Irish
doesn't mean that you're not Irish.
A name like Odell, for example, without an apostrophe?
Your Honor,
there has been no real damage here
because Mr. Steinman--
or as he is now called, Mr. O'Dell--
has no Irish heritage to be damaged, in my opinion.
Yes. I overrule the motion for emergency relief.
How's Jackie doing?
Good. She wants to go on a cruise.
Really?
Yes. She watches the TV commercials.
Mm-hmm. And you'll go on a cruise with her?
No. I've had enough water for a lifetime.
Right, right. Coming over from Cuba.
No. Working as a lifeguard.
Oh. So, um, Peter wanted me to talk to you, Cristian.
After the election,
they won't need your services much anymore.
I see.
Well, if Jackie's fine with that, I am fine.
This is coming from Peter.
I'll have to speak to Jackie.
I've seen your arrest record, Cristian.
Really?
Drunk and disorderly, simple assault.
In Daytona Beach.
Not a good thing.
Yes. Terrible.
And your debts.
$18,000 to the Oceanfront Inn.
I think they're still looking for you.
Peter can be quite generous.
This is a check for $25,000.
It's his personal thank you to you.
You take it, you leave tonight.
You tell Jackie you had some issues in Florida.
And why would I do that?
Oh, well, to be blunt, Peter is going to be governor,
and he thinks you're using his mother.
Oh. What's going on?
Nothing.
Abernathy is on a sciatica walk,
and the guard won't let us in until he's back.
Go ahead and sleep.
You broke up with Laura?
No. She with me.
I'm sorry.
You're still friends?
I don't know.
I think she thinks
I was getting between you two.
That kiss opened up something between us again, didn't it?
I don't know how to close it.
I know.
But if we pursue it,
it'll just be like last time.
What was last time?
I don't know.
It'll be worse.
I'm with Peter, and I just...
I can't figure my way out of this one.
Oh, God.
What do we do?
This night is over, we talk.
We can't.
To hell with the bad timing.
We talk.
Psst, Judy? Judy?
Uh, so, I imagine your field trip was productive.
Yes, Your Honor.
And when we left, you were ready to decide.
Actually, Your Honor,
we do have one more witness.
Oh, not poor Nana Joe again.
I think she was ready to collapse.
No, a new witness. Jordan Kalla-haley-car...
Jordan Karahalios? I'm sorry, Your Honor.
We have to object to this on the grounds...
He was fired from the Florrick...
And how many months did you work for Mr. Florrick's campaign?
Three. I was relieved of my duties in March.
So you have some insider
information on the issue of this ballot box?
I do. Uh, at a meeting on February 18,
Eli Gold and I discussed ways to sweeten the vote
if the election was close.
And what were Mr. Gold's thoughts on this sweetening?
A drop box.
Objection, Your Honor.
This witness is doubly biased.
He was fired by our client,
and he works for the third party.
Then you can argue that in your cross.
And did you argue against this drop box?
He likes the third party candidate.
I did, strenuously, but i was overruled by Mr. Gold.
It is almost 5:00 a.m. now.
The polls will be open in one hour, and
I find myself humbled in the face of this decision.
As has been said by many of you at various times,
there is a sanctity to the voting booth, but...
...that sanctity is not absolute.
It needs our constant vigilance.
It needs our confidence
that the votes are, in fact, true.
I hereby am ordering
that these 30,843 votes be excluded
from any vote total, and that they be
provisionally preserved for a possible appeal.
And good night.
Get some rest.
I'll start the appeal process.
I better go tell Peter.
Sad to think you can lose an election in court these days.
Why the hurry, huh?
The place is gonna blow.
What time is it?
5:45.
Polls open in 15 minutes.
What are you watching?
Hostel 3.
I love horror movies.
Do you know why I love horror movies?
Why?
Because they're awesome.
We're gonna lose, aren't we?
Yes.
Is Peter prepared?
He's adjusted his thinking.
You ran a great campaign, Eli.
He'll need you.
He loves you.
Zach... Wake up.
Mom... What's up?
Shh, shh, shh. I have an idea.
I need your help.
Thank you, Your Honor,
for hearing one of our witnesses again.
Your Honor, I think i speak for the whole world when I say
can we please all get some sleep?
Patience, Ms. Nyholm.
Zach, you're still under oath.
So you've been working for the Florrick campaign
these last seven months.
Yes, in the I.T. Department.
Ah, good morning. We've sent out for bagels.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now Jordan Karahalios stated that Eli met with him
on February 18, and told him, over Jordan's objections,
that they needed to consider a stuffed ballot box.
Are you aware of this testimony?
I've been made aware of it.
And do you know this testimony to be false?
I do.
How do you know that?
Because Eli wasn't the campaign manager on February 18.
He had been replaced by Jordan.
So Jordan couldn't have been overruled by Eli? Or anyone?
Not true!
Eli Gold was still consulting with the campaign.
Mr. Kamahama-halios, please take your seat.
So, Jordan was the campaign manager at that point in time?
He was the boss?
Yes, that's correct.
I tender the witness.
So let's return to your arrest, shall we?
No, Counselor. We've pretty much bounced every way
we can on this witness's reliability.
Thank you, Mr. Florrick. You may step down.
Uh, you'll have my revised ruling in a few hours.
You were great.
Thanks.
Hey, what you watching?
Video.
Can I ask you a hypothetical?
No.
So let's say I'm approached about leaving the law firm,
and joining a small start-up firm, right?
And I'm offered more money than here.
But I like it here.
And I'll also probably like it at this law firm, too.
So do you make your decision
based on money or loyalty?
Um, how much more money are they offering you?
In my hypothetical?
In your hypothetical.
It's a good amount-- 20% more.
Hey, what do I do?
You should go with Cary.
Will, you'd better see this.
Kalinda... I was up all night.
I know. So was I. Will.
That's outside the polling place.
Yeah. A surveillance camera across the street.
Jim Moody.
He works for the Florrick campaign.
Where'd you get this?
Talked to the mini-mart across the street.
Are there any other copies?
No. Just this one.
I heard it went well in court.
It did. Your son did good.
But you have something for me?
Can you just give us a minute please?
Thank you.
Kalinda found some evidence.
No one else has seen it.
And you're telling me this why?
I want to know what to do with it.
Well, you're the lawyer. You decide.
This decision needs to be the client's.
Why are you doing this?
I need direction.
No, if you needed direction,
you'd have given it to Alicia to show me.
I didn't want to hurt her.
You've really handled this poorly.
That's possible.
She's my wife.
Then punch me.
It shows your 30,000 votes are fraudulent.
If it goes to the judge, you'll lose.
Then I'll lose.
This seems to be some kind of a lesson in mutual hypocrisy
which I'm not gonna participate in.
So you want me to bury it?
Do what you want.
You want me to lose, show it to the judge.
You want me to win, don't.
I'm not owning this decision.
What do you think?
I think we're good.
Oh, no, no, no. Everybody, sit down. I'm fine.
Okay, so,
uh, in thinking over my early determination,
I thought of a story.
Uh, it's about a very young boy,
um, an old man and a donkey.
What the hell, I'm too tired.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
The votes are to be admitted.
We did it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's a good thing.
It is.
Oh, my God.
I didn't think that would happen!
And did you see the totals?
Hey!
You won by over a half million votes.
What?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, the polling was off.
We didn't need to go to court, and fight tooth and nail.
Hey, where's Alicia? I have to find Alicia.
No. You got to be downstairs in the ballroom in 15 minutes.
And you-know-who's here.
He made it?
Yeah, yeah, he's here for a meeting of his,
uh, reduce gun violence coalition.
Peter, congratulations.
Or should I say condolences?
With the deficit you're gonna have to deal with.
Eli.
Eli, nice to see you.
This is my deputy mayor, Patty Harris.
Nice to meet you.
Listen, I've got tickets, uh, any time you want them
for the Cubs World Series.
That's a pretty safe thing to offer.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Peter.
Mom!
I am so proud of you.
Oh, I knew you could do it. I knew it.
Congratulations, Mr. Florrick.
Uh, thanks, Cristian.
Have you got a moment?
Yes.
Eli talked to you, right?
What?
Eli talked to you, right?
Oh, he did.
We had a very good talk.
Yeah. Well, he gave you the $25,000 check?
Yes, I cashed it. Thank you.
No... no. That was so you'd leave.
No, I don't think so.
Yes, it was.
Well, I don't want to go.
It's not about what you want.
Yes, it is.
获胜方 彼得·福瑞克
Hey. You startled me.
Florrick won the governorship.
Yeah, I saw.
What's up?
Don't ever do that to me again.
Do what?
Lead me on with a salary proposal and then go to Robyn.
Kalinda...
Go to hell, Cary.
And good luck with Robyn.
Kalinda...
Kalinda.
Hey, there you are!
Congratulations!
Zach! Zach, come here, come here.
You really helped me out. You know that, don't you?
Dad, it was nothing.
It was something. It was something.
Mom...
Alicia's in the bedroom.
Okay.
It's my life. It's not yours.
Don't mess with it. Ever.
Congratulations, son.
彼得·福瑞克 51% 迈克·克里斯特瓦 46%
There you are.
We did it.
Thank you.
Oh, no reason to thank me. You did it.
How are you?
Good.
How's it feel to be the First Lady of Illinois?
Odd.
Odd.
I need to freshen up.
You good?
Good... yeah, I'm good.
Just... un-fresh.
Hi. Congratulations.
One second!
Do you still want to talk?
Meet me at my apartment.
I'll... I'll get away.
Right now.
Is this stupid?
Thanks for doing this here.
No problem.
What are you thinking?
I'm in.
