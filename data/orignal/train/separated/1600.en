Hey! What the hell's going on? He's with me. He's my foster son.
We've got to start communicating.
We're communicating right now!
We're never gonna get anywhere
if we keep pointing the finger at each other.
We need to go to therapy.
I cheated on my boyfriend...
and I lost my virginity to a random boy I barely know.
I'm pretty sure that makes me a slut.
You know what? We all do things that we wish we hadn't.
What do I say to Callie? She's gonna hate me.
The next time you're looking for adventure,
you ought to knock on my door.
A.J., you're my foster brother. I can't.
Hello?
A.J., it's Ty.
You were three minutes long this morning.
Can you stop timing my showers?
Sure. Can you actually stick to schedule?
Yeah, Brandon, you're first,
so if you're late the whole system gets messed up.
A couple minutes doesn't matter.
Until Callie gets in there,
and then three minutes turns to five...
Okay, wait. You're timing me now? I'm on your side here.
And then after A.J., we're at six...
Whoa, whoa. Leave me out of this.
So when's construction gonna be done?
Well, unfortunately,
we had to fire the contractor. It's a long story...
What are you doing with ketchup on tacos?
That's disgusting!
That's gross.
So, Callie, we're going to the store tomorrow.
Is there anything in particular you want for your birthday party?
I'd hardly call it a party
when it's just us and the quinns.
Well, lucky it's not your party then, isn't it?
Um, no. Whatever is easy is fine...
But I would like to, maybe talk about my...
birthday gift to myself.
Yeah?
"Your birthday gift to yourself"?
Well, interesting. What... what exactly did you have in mind?
So I have been saving from my job,
and I have $800.
Well done.
Wow. Good job.
And I would like to buy myself a car.
Oh, honey, I... I don't know.
Okay, I know it's a big deal,
But it would just make it so much easier to get to work,
and school and I could help you guys, too,
you know with errands and stuff...
Careful what you wish for. They will run you ragged.
Ey! Hey! Take it easy over there.
Um, not that I mind. I don't mind.
I think that that's very admirable, Callie,
But I don't know if that
$800 is enough to buy something that's safe.
I thought you would say that,
Um... But airbags have actually been standard since the '90s.
Boy, you have done your research.
Yes, so there are options.
Uh, well, you know, what about monthly costs?
There's gas and insurance...
Well, you pay for Brandon's monthly costs...
And you bought him a car.
Sounds like sexism to me.
Okay, moms didn't buy that car. It was a hand-me-down.
That got totaled, and then they bought you a nicer one.
It wasn't my fault.
I'd like to make it clear that
insurance paid for that car.
Yes, and it belongs to all of you, by the way.
What... it does?
Yes, now that Callie has her license
and the twins will soon, too. Yes, it does.
What if we had two cars to share?
Honey, I'm sorry.
But for now, the answer is no.
So, have you talked to Callie yet...
about the Wyatt of it all?
Are you even going to?
Um, I wanna...
I just, I'm gonna wait
until after her birthday party to tell her.
You know, if I ruin that on top of everything else,
she'll never forgive me.
Well, that's gonna suck.
Do you think she even should... tell her, I mean?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
It's just... Mariana's really hurting.
I know she would take it back if she could,
but she can't.
It's not like she's dating Wyatt.
It's just gonna hurt Callie.
Maybe everything doesn't have to be talked about.
Well, I'm not gonna argue with you about that one.
Does this mean we don't have to go to therapy tomorrow?
No.
Just checking...
Hey, bud.
Hey!
So, everyone's going to be here at 5:00...
I told them to park down the street,
so she won't see the cars...
Good idea.
And Callie has no idea.
Happy birthday!
What?
What is this?
Wow, Mariana...
What is this?
600 bucks.
I saved it from my quinceanera and my allowance.
But, I want you to have it...
So you can get a car that moms will approve.
Uh, why would you...
No, Mariana, I can't.
What about, when you turn 16 and you want to buy a car?
I'll just borrow yours.
No. I can't keep this.
Okay, but what if we bought a car together?
You know, with both of our jobs, I'm sure...
gas and insurance will be easy.
Really?
Okay. I'm in.
We just have to get moms on board.
Why?
Sometimes it's better to ask forgiveness than permission.
So...
It's really clear that you two love each other.
Oh, well, thank god.
But...
What's also clear
is that your concern for each other
is making you polite.
That doesn't work.
Polite?
It doesn't feel very polite.
No, no. Probably not.
Because all of your real issues then end up getting subverted
and coming out in all these passive-aggressive ways.
Sound familiar?
So...
I want you both to make lists.
Everything you love about each other...
and everything that drives you nuts.
And next week, we'll read them.
Out loud?
Mm-hmm.
We're going to jump start your communication skills.
Starting with everything that we hate about each other?
I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry, but aren't you supposed to be helping us stay married?
Pretty sweet, right?
Nelson was my first car.
It breaks my heart to have to sell him.
But I can tell you two will take care of him as well as I did.
So he's yours, if you want.
$1,400.
We'll take it... him...
for $1,150.
But the ad said $1,400.
I know.
The car's in perfect condition.
I really can't let him go for any less.
That's too bad. Thank you.
What are you doing?
We're playing hardball.
She needs to know that we're
willing to walk away to take her seriously.
No, Mariana, she named her car...
Okay? This is not someone you can negotiate with.
Okay, trust me.
She's going to ask us to stop in like five seconds.
She's leaving.
Okay, she's going to call.
Two hours tops.
Hey! What's up?
Hey! What happened?
I was waiting for you like you said.
I got into some trouble.
What kind of trouble?
Look, just tell me where you are and I'll come get you.
Tonight, I can't.
Tomorrow?
Okay. I gotta go.
All right. Peace.
You need some help?
Uh, yeah. Could you grab that card table?
Where'd you get the phone?
Your dad.
Oh, yeah? Who were you talking to?
Your dad.
It's been a half hour, Mariana,
Okay? I'm tired of playing hardball.
That's our car.
Okay, we can't cave. Not now.
But Nelson...
Fine!
Hi! My sister and I just test drove your car earlier...
Oh! Is that right?
What?
Okay, great. Thanks.
Nelson found a new home.
Mariana!
There you are! Where've you been?
The Quinns are going to be here any minute! Come on!
Paper products and platters on the big table.
We're eating buffet style tonight...
and you will come back for condiments.
Surprise!
Don't look at me.
Oh, we didn't tell Mariana.
You know, she would've blown the whole thing.
Look, this is the first
truly happy birthday you've had in a long time,
and I...all of us wanted to help you celebrate it!
Did I miss a surprise?
So you had no idea?
None!
Hey, where's dad? You two are the only people I actually invited.
I don't know. Mom dropped me off.
Hey, girl!
Get over here!
You seriously weren't going to tell us it was your birthday?
Yeah, thank god Jude had the sense to invite us.
Of course that means we got
double the chores to do at the house tomorrow...
But yay! Happy birthday!
Hey! Happy birthday!
And I, sincerely mean it.
Look at you...
really nice turn out.
Thanks.
A lot of people love you, Callie.
Well, that's awkward.
I guess, maybe we should've checked Jude's guest list.
I got half the mind to smack that kid.
Mariana said she was the one who instigated it,
so, no need for violence.
Well, there's something you can add to your hate list.
Honey, it's not a hate list...
The delivery guys were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago.
Ah, well, I'm sure they're just running behind, honey.
We'll give them a call though.
Yeah. We can do that.
Do you think Callie's having fun?
I think that you are the bestest brother ever.
Hey, did you talk to A.J. this morning?
What do you mean?
Like on the phone?
I kinda overheard him on a call. He was acting weird.
He said he was talking to you.
I'm sure he was.
It's like, what time?
What's eating you, b?
Well, I just... I...
I think he was talking to his brother.
Why? Did he say something specific?
Uh, no. He's just being all secretive or whatever.
I'm not concerned.
Hey! Can you grab me a lighter?
I'm sorry if me being here is weird,
since you're avoiding me and all.
I'm not avoiding you.
It's just complicated.
'Cause of callie, I get that.
And she doesn't know about anything, so...
Don't worry.
Also, I had a boyfriend.
Like, when we...
Exactly.
I'm sorry I didn't...
It's not your fault.
It's okay.
So you had a boyfriend?
Or you have?
Yo, Callie, check this out.
*She's a "C" To the "A" To the double l-i-e*
*And a better friend there could never be*
*Though if she's feeling that hunger itch*
*Girl will straight steal your sandwich*
*As her former roommate, I must confess*
*Callie's a slob a total mess*
That's true.
*I lived with her and if you care*
*I never seen her brush her hair*
*But we're just teasing you know she's the best*
*'cause we're her friends we're hashtag blessed*
Yo! Drop it like it's hot, ladies.
Surprised to see me?
Yeah.
Um, listen, my mums don't know that I got fired.
I know. I kind of assumed as much when I got invited.
We miss you at the center.
Yeah. I miss you guys, too.
Hey, so what's he doing here?
Uh, he kinda lives here now.
Really?
Wow! Well, that's unexpected.
Trust me, yeah.
Callie...
Hey, dad!
Happy birthday. Sorry I'm late.
Thank you.
No!
I guess I missed the big moment, huh?
Don't worry about it. Did you see Soph?
Why did you guys not come together?
I had a work thing.
Callie, sorry to interrupt...
Becka has another present for you.
Go.
The party's out there, you know?
I'm just taking a break.
So, what do you think of your new foster brother?
Not much. Why?
He's cute.
Objectively, he's cute.
I didn't make the rules.
So what? You don't like him? Why not?
Well, for one, he stole something from me.
Something worth a lot of money.
Do your moms know?
Um... no.
He gave it back.
But I still think he's full of crap.
So why not tell them?
I should've, but I...
I can't now. I had to sell it...
to replace something I lost.
Specific much?
And my moms can't find out about it.
So there's nothing I can do.
Well, there's got to be something.
Okay, so this is your immediate future. Okay?
Two of cups?
You're going to have coffee.
Great.
It actually means romance.
That's unlikely.
Well, it could also mean friendship.
Well, now you're just guessing.
I mean, so this card is the final outcome.
Okay.
What does it mean?
Chaos, upheaval and downfall.
Happy birthday.
See that bulge in his pocket?
Uh, no.
Not that bulge. Gross.
Right front pocket.
His phone. Should have all the proof
that you need to show your dad that he's lying, right?
So?
So, you need to get it.
Right, yeah. I'll just go up to him and be like,
"Hey, A.J., can I borrow your phone?
I'd like to check the call history."
It's a fair point.
Everything all right with you and certain surprise guest?
You can say his name.
And he actually asked me out.
Really? And?
I don't know. I mean...
He's nice and cute and...
he doesn't think Callie would care.
Said I should just ask her.
And what do you think?
Well, let's say I do ask her...
and let's say she's cool with Wyatt and I getting together, and...
then maybe you don't have to tell Callie
that you already got together.
Well, if it doesn't bother Callie now,
then that means it wouldn't bother her then, right?
You're gonna make a really great lawyer someday.
Is that really how you want to handle this?
Hey, guys.
Hey, honey.
Okay, so you remember the '98 sedan we were looking at?
The guy just texted me back and he's bringing it over.
When?
In an hour.
Well, you can't just test drive a car in the middle of your party.
No one's gonna notice if we're gone a few minutes.
Whose birthday is it anyway? Come on.
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
How's everything at the center?
Good, yeah. Real good.
How's Callie doing?
Good. Yeah. She's doing good.
Let me ask you something...
Where was Callie when I dropped off Carmen last week?
I had to let Callie go.
I thought she was doing really well.
Yeah. She was.
She was doing great.
So what happened?
He did.
And who is he?
Her new foster brother.
Here you go.
Thanks.
If, uh...
If Ty calls... when he calls, you'd let me know, right?
Right.
Okay.
Another round of burgers are up if you're hungry.
Uh, no, thanks. I think I'll save room for cake.
I wanted to tell you how sorry Lena...
and I were to hear about you and Jill.
Were you? Sorry?
I never had any intention of telling Jill.
Stef, you were blackmailing me.
It was a risk I couldn't take.
Well, I am still sorry to hear about the separation.
But you were the one who chose to have an affair.
How 'bout this?
We put on a slow song...
I'll ask A.J. to dance...
I'll snuggle up to him, and you know...
grab his phone out of his pocket.
Um, no, you're 15.
I'm not pimping you out just to prove my dad wrong.
Fine. You want to dance with him?
Or... we could just unplug
his phone from the charger and take it.
It's got everything we need.
Yeah, including a big dent in the bumper.
Which gives a character.
It's time that we negotiate.
So? What do you think?
It's yours for $1,350.
We'll take it.
What happened to negotiating?
Um, we just have to get some money out from the bank...
Uh, do you think you can hold it until tomorrow?
That works.
Call me in the morning.
Perfect.
Will do.
We just bought a car.
I know!
Where's that from?
It's from a box of old photos my dad just gave me.
Oh! It's great to have those.
I can't get over the bowl cut. I mean, honestly...
And look at how happy she is smiling there.
When she was a kid, Callie was obsessed with her birthdays.
And, apparently, The Little Mermaid as well.
It was never just one day.
She always made it like her birth-week.
And one time she even made it her birth-month.
Well... you threw a very nice party.
Good job.
I saw you talking to Robert.
Yeah. Apparently it's my fault
that he and jill separated because...
I threatened to tell her about the affair.
Don't look at me like that.
Like what?
I know that you think what I did was wrong.
You can add that to your hate list.
Honey, I really wish you would stop calling it a hate list.
That's what it feels like.
I'm pretty sure that
it defeats the purpose of the exercise.
What? I'm sorry about that.
Hey, we need more buns.
Here it is.
You know what, Mike, take a break.
I got it.
Did I walk in on something?
No, it's fine. We're going to couples counseling.
Really?
Everything all right?
Yeah, it's fine.
It's just the therapist has us making lists
of everything that we love and h...
don't like about each other.
That sounds like a bad idea.
You've agreed to this?
What could I say?
That's what married couples do, right?
I know.
I should've agreed to go to counseling with you.
I got it.
Well, in hindsight though,
No amount of therapy was going to turn you into a woman.
Wait, wait. If I was a woman, you think we'd still be together?
Oh, god, no. That's funny.
You didn't have to answer that fast.
Is it weird having Wyatt here?
No. No, we're cool now.
That's nice.
So, question for you...
Okay?
It just occurred to me, today...
you know, since Wyatt's single and cute...
and now I'm single and cute...
you wouldn't care if I ever went out with him, would you?
I mean, only if you don't mind.
You just broke up with Mat.
I know, but I was thinking that maybe, if I started dating again,
it'll help me get over him.
Um...Wyatt and I are just friends now.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
No record of any incoming or outgoing calls...
no texts... wow.
He's erased everything. He's covering his tracks.
Well, maybe there's a way to find out what he deleted.
Okay, now, Charlie's angels. Come on.
Hey! Got a sec?
Uh, sure.
So, um... I talked to Callie...
And?
And you were right...
She's totally cool with us.
So...
So...
you want to go out with me?
I mean, if you're into the whole french cowboy thing...
Of course, I do.
Oui...
Oui.
Having fun?
Yeah.
You don't sound so sure about that.
I think Mariana wants to go out with Wyatt.
Why do you say that?
'Cause she asked me if it was okay.
Oh! What did...what did you say?
That it's fine.
Is it?
I mean, it's kinda weird.
My sister and my ex-boyfriend.
Hey! Where's my phone?
I haven't seen it.
Are you sure about that?
Give it to me. Now!
Who is this? Huh?
Who's calling?
How the hell am I supposed to know,
you got my phone?
Hello!
I said give it to me.
Who is this, your brother?
Brandon! Brandon!
What's going on?
He tried to steal my phone.
He freaked out 'cause I answered the phone.
What are you doing answering his phone, Brandon?
It's like I told you. He's talking to his brother...
or someone else that he doesn't want you to know about.
Give me the phone!
Okay, everyone...
Hi, did you just call?
Yeah, don't call this number again, okay?
Just some kid who saw the number on the water tower.
What are you doing?
I... I... I was worried...
Worried about what?
There's nothing to worry about, okay?
Stay the hell out of it, Brandon!
You okay? What was that about?
That guy doesn't want me here, okay?
He don't like me.
I'm really sorry he did that.
You know, word of advice, now that you've got two kids...
You can't play favorites.
I know you're trying to show A.J. that you trust him...
but you can't do that at Brandon's expense.
Uh, hi. Can I talk to you for a sec?
Sure.
Hey! You got another party you're going to?
No, I, uh...
I'm just letting my mom know when to pick me up.
Oh, your dad can't take you home? Where is he?
I don't want him to.
Okay.
Why not?
Did you know that, um...
that he cheated on my mom?
You know, I totally remember...
the first time I realized that my dad was human.
And man, it was hard...
seeing him actually make mistakes.
It's just so humiliating.
No one... no one thinks that
this has anything to do with you, I promise you.
And, uh...
It doesn't mean that your dad loves you any less.
I know that for a fact.
I hope you'll stay around for cake... yeah?
We need to break up.
I'm kidding.
But, I don't think we should do this.
Why?
Because Callie said that she was okay with it...
but she's not.
I hear A.J. got you fired.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna narc on you.
That's up to you to do.
I'm gonna... I just wanted to have... yeah.
You'll find the right time.
Callie... why is he in your house?
I was trying to help him.
You know...
You are so good at taking care of other people.
Just once...
I'd like to see you take care of yourself.
I really don't want to talk to you right now.
All right.
Okay, but look...
something happened the other day,
when A.J. was with me in the squad car...
and I guess I'm just...
sensitive to people accusing him...
Okay, but what about me?
You seem pretty fine of accusing me of just about anything.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to accuse you...
Save it for the son you wish you had.
You know, you've been here
to see him more in the last few weeks
than you've ever come to see me in the last few years.
I was... just...
looking out for you. It won't happen again.
Look, Brandon, I'm sorry.
I screwed up.
I'm new to this. I don't know how to parent you kids.
It's a big change, I know.
I need you to understand,
I'm never gonna choose anyone over you.
Okay?
You know, the entire time that we went out,
all you did was yank me around.
I was understanding... I was patient.
I did everything that you ever asked me to do...
just for you to dump me.
Now you're not gonna let Mariana date me either?
I already told Mariana,
if you two want to date,
I don't have any rights to stand in your way. Okay?
You're right. You don't!
No.
'Cause we didn't do anything wrong.
What?
And honestly, I'm really tired of all this stressing,
about whether you're gonna get upset about something.
What do you mean, do anything wrong, Wyatt?
What? When?
She's been so scared...
that you would find out and get all upset.
Like you said, you don't have any right to be,
so I don't even know why we're keeping this a secret.
Keeping what a secret?
That Mariana and I hooked up...
at the end-of-school party.
What do you mean you hooked up?
*Happy birthday to you*
Callie!
*Happy birthday to you*
You good? Come on.
*Happy birthday, dear Callie*
*Happy birthday to you*
Stop eating all of it.
You had sex with Wyatt?
I... Can we go somewhere?
What? You don't want people to hear?
No, I just... I just want to explain.
There's nothing to explain, Mariana.
Look, I am so sorry.
If you were fine with me and Wyatt dating
then... Is the sex thing really that big a deal?
I mean, it was a mistake, and it only happened once.
And what about lying to me? Is that a one time thing, too?
I told you I lost my virginity...
You assumed that it was Mat, so...
What? Did I really lie?
This isn't a negotiation, Mariana.
Okay, if you wanna date Wyatt...
It doesn't really matter to me, okay?
But don't pretend like you care what I think.
No... Look, I don't want to date Wyatt.
I just thought...
That in this case my permission
would be easier to get than my forgiveness?
No! I just thought that...
If he was my boyfriend...
I wouldn't be that girl that lost it to,
you know, some random guy she barely knows.
I'd be the girl that lost her virginity to her boyfriend.
Someone I can maybe...
eventually love...
The way I love Mat.
I was gonna tell you.
I swear.
I was... Just not today.
I didn't want to ruin your party.
Oh, the big surprise party I didn't want?
It's a little late for that, Mariana.
Hey! Just the girl I'm looking for.
Can I borrow you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Okay. Come on.
Here.
Brandon was right.
I've been talking to Ty.
Okay?
Look...
If you want to run...
and I really hope you don't...
But if you do, there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm glad you're back in touch with Ty.
All I ask is that you keep me in the loop.
What's going on?
Wait. Give me one sec.
Happy birthday.
Sorry about the bow...
I don't know where they get those giant ones.
You got me a car?
Yeah! You like it?
I do!
I will handle the insurance, don't worry,
but the gas is all you.
I wasn't sure if you like red.
I think cops pull over the color red more than any other,
but hey, that might be a good thing.
Keep you from speeding.
Uh, I can't take it.
Why not?
I don't think it's fair on the other kids in the family,
and I kinda made a deal with Mariana,
we're gonna get a car together.
I don't really wanna go back on that.
You might be the only teenager
that turned down a car, like...
Sorry.
...ever.
It's so sweet, though.
You're a good kid.
So will you be able to take it back?
Probably not.
But Sophia's gonna be driving soon, so...
I, uh...
I told her...about the affair.
She was really lashing out at her mom
about the whole separation and I just...
...felt like I owed her the truth, you know?
Of course, now she's not talking to me.
You know, the best gift you ever gave me...
Is even when I was so mad at you...
And even when I told you to leave me alone...
You never did.
Where are you going?
Connor's.
Oh, you're leaving my party?
The party you never wanted? Yeah, I am.
Jude, I didn't mean it.
No, I love that you did all this, really...
It's just, all these people paying attention to me...
It's a lot.
You used to love your birthdays.
Yeah.
I guess I don't really remember that girl anymore.
Well, I guess, I have to remember her for you.
Okay. I have one more surprise for you.
Though, you might hate it.
I remember it wasn't a birthday party
unless Mom and Dad got you one of these.
Sorry...
You're kidding?
Come on!
Guys, come on! This bouncy castle's way too big for two people.
Rita, come on. Guys, Rita!
Come on! Yes!
No.
Rita, yes! Get in here!
No... All right.
Look out, I'm coming in.
Rita!
Get back! Everybody!
Keep your distance!
Here's that piece of cake that you've been holding out for.
Thanks.
You know, everything that I did...
During the custody battle...
I keep telling myself it was all justified...
Look, Stef, I don't blame the problems in my marriage on you...
No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. I...
You've been really good to Callie...
And you've proven yourself to be an honorable man
and what I did, it was not...
honorable.

Callie knows.
You told her?
I don't think she'll ever stop being mad at me.
Well, she doesn't look too mad right now.
Go! Bounce with your sister.
You'll be happy to know that I apologized to Robert.
Nice. Add that to my love list.
Oh, good. At least you'll have something on that list.
Honey... Almost everything I write ends up on the love list.
It does. I...
Whenever I think of something that drives me crazy about you...
I immediately want to come to your defense,
because I know why you're quick to react,
because you're protecting our family,
and I know why sometimes you snap, because
you're stressed
from taking care of everybody.
I don't think those lists were meant
to make us focus on all the bad stuff.
Rita's done!
I never gave you a present.
"Super Callie"?
I know it's stupid, but Marvel already took all the good names.
You're such a dork.
I'm sorry.
I know nothing's gonna happen while we're under the same roof.
Well, there's no roof here.
