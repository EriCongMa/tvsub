what happened to &quot; bar attorneys stick together &quot; ?
when have bar attorneys ever stuck together ?
hey , someone &apos;s got money .
dui in the suit .
no , nervous kid on the end .
it &apos;s a drug lawyer .
hey , is that , um ... ?
yeah .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
she tried to steal an election .
where else would she go ?
bar attorney ?
yeah .
back row .
ah . sorry .
it &apos;s my first day .
really ? wouldn &apos;t have guessed .
alicia florrick .
we know .
i voted for you .
oh . sorry about that .
i have a crammed lockup today ,
so let &apos;s all work together ,
and we &apos;ll get through this with some alacrity .
how many bar attorneys do i have ?
gentlemen , you have three bar attorneys here for you today .
they &apos;ve been approved by the chicago
bar association to help with the non @-@ indigents .
that means you .
congratulations , gentlemen . you may think you &apos;re poor ,
but you are not poor enough to have a public defender .
so you have the option of hiring one of these three .
four .
just so you know , you &apos;re under no obligation to hire them .
bar attorneys are merely a convenience for you
and for the court so we can dispense with your case today .
if you want to find your own attorney ,
you will have to do so tonight after the bond hearing ,
which will , of course , push your hearing to tomorrow .
still , it &apos;s up to you . do you understand ?
i don &apos;t get involved
with the fee , so make your arrangements with them .
ms. quinn , you have 12 defendants .
males 114 to 125 .
mr. bukovitz , eight .
126 to 133 . come on .
mr. weingarten , ten .
134 to 143 .
lyndquist ?
all right , matan .
mr.lyndquist.
i &apos;ll look through these in order
of importance .
you have kids ? mr. hocker ?
start with misdemeanors .
are you employed , mr. lyndquist ?
witnesses put you at the scene of the crime .
is that what we got here ?
this is the third time in two years .
yes , your honor .
you have kids ?
is your wife here ? at the back ?
in the corner .
excuse me , am i supposed to check in with someone ?
what ?
well , the judge-- he didn &apos;t include me .
oh , yeah , i saw that .
let &apos;s put them at the bottom of the stack
and get this party started .
your honor , excuse me .
i just wanted to introduce myself .
i &apos;m alicia florrick .
i &apos;m on my way to lunch , ma &apos;am .
yes , sir , but i just wanted you to know
that i am available as a bar attorney .
yes , i get that .
thank you .
i fought over 45 criminal cases , your honor .
yes , and you were partner at florrick @-@ agos ,
and your husband is governor , and you ran for state &apos;s attorney .
i &apos;m aware of it .
then you know i &apos;m capable , sir .
of winning cases . so ?
i have 350 cases a day to process .
that &apos;s a case every 90 seconds .
and if i fall behind , i hear from the chief justice .
i won &apos;t hold you up , sir .
yes , you will .
you &apos;re play @-@ acting .
the other bar attorneys in there--
they need the money , they &apos;re hungry .
i have kids in college .
i don &apos;t share finances with my husband .
you were a partner in a top firm .
yes .
and i can &apos;t get a job since ... since the scandal .
i can &apos;t help you , ma &apos;am .
the last thing i need in my courtroom is a marie antoinette .
i &apos;m not a marie antoinette .
your ride , mrs. florrick .
from mr. canning .
he wants to take you to lunch .
no .
i didn &apos;t ask it yet .
it &apos;s the same answer as before . i don &apos;t want to work for you .
work with me .
i don &apos;t want to work with you .
why not ?
you &apos;re the devil .
i @-@ i ... i thought you liked me .
i do like you , but i don &apos;t like your cases .
i don &apos;t like who you defend .
tobacco , pharmaceuticals .
alicia , i &apos;ve looked into your finances ,
and you made a bad deal on your exit agreement .
you &apos;re doing grunt work as a bar attorney for $ 135 a case .
thank you for lunch , mr. canning .
now wait .
all i &apos;m saying is , there &apos;s no honor in starting over .
for the first time in my life ,
i don &apos;t have to answer to anyone .
it &apos;s just me .
have you read milan kundera ?
what ? no .
i have ... in the hospital ,
&apos;cause , um , i had a lot of time .
two people bump into each other on a sidewalk ...
and it &apos;s nobody &apos;s fault , just a complete accident .
one person instinctively says , &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
and the other says , &quot; watch it ! &quot;
okay ?
you &apos;re the apologizer .
and for no good reason .
because you &apos;re a woman who occupies space on this planet ?
that &apos;s why you should work for me .
let the devil teach you how to say , &quot; watch it . &quot;
you just let it slip .
&quot; work for me . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to work for you .
i don &apos;t want to answer for anyone else .
what ?
you @-@ you seem like you &apos;re gonna launch into a ...
would you excuse me , please ?
... inspiring soliloquy about self @-@ sufficiency .
alicia . what &apos;s up ?
peter should run .
what ?
i said , i think peter should run .
eli ?
uh , y @-@ y @-@ yes .
i just have to put a few things into operation .
why ? why @-@ why ... why are you changing your mind ?
i realized i was deciding things for peter ,
and i &apos;m through with people making decisions for me .
you &apos;re snapping fingers at me .
i don &apos;t know what snapping fingers means .
get ruth on the line ! ruth eastman !
is grace okay with this ?
grace has always been okay with it . it was me .
you will be involved ?
it depends what you need .
tomorrow we need to declare .
i &apos;ll get us a tv interview .
after 5 .
i &apos;ll call you back .
you &apos;re in .
alicia ?
yeah .
we &apos;ve got to get moving fast !
why ? what did she say ?
oh , something about not wanting to speak for you ,
or something eloquent .
we &apos;ve got to make a play for ruth eastman .
she &apos;s the miracle worker of iowa ,
and she won &apos;t work with hillary .
eastman &apos;s leaving her office right now .
she asked to call you tomorrow .
no .
tell her i &apos;m coming to her .
tell her not to leave ! she &apos;s fielding offers .
we got to get ours in quick .
i haven &apos;t decided yet , sir .
no , i think you have a very good chance .
you said you wouldn &apos;t leave .
can i call you back , sir ?
who &apos;s that ? o &apos;malley ? sanders ? webb ?
i didn &apos;t say i wouldn &apos;t leave , eli .
peter florrick is running .
running for what ?
he &apos;s making a play for vice president .
no .
hillary will choose a senator .
no , a governor , an outsider .
someone with a good story .
a man in prison , wrongfully convicted ,
who comes back in triumph to become governor .
a man whose wife tried to steal an election .
a beloved wife who was misled by her handlers .
weren &apos;t you one of those handlers ?
peter needs to come in a strong second in iowa ,
or the press will write us off .
i &apos;m heading to the airport , eli .
let &apos;s talk tomorrow .
$ 25,000 a month , ruth .
five percent of the media budget , no cap .
a win bonus of two months salary .
you won &apos;t get better from sanders .
hello .
could you hold , please ?
eli , i have to take this .
just don &apos;t say &quot; yes . &quot;
promise me you &apos;ll meet peter first .
i &apos;ll meet peter first . can i go now ?
yes .
mrs. florrick , hello .
you &apos;re home early from court .
i asked ms. smulders to wait in the office for you .
ms .... ?
smulders . your first client .
from the web site ?
yeah .
zach put it up last night . it looks really good .
alicia florrick , attorney @-@ at @-@ law .
yes , she &apos;s busy , your honor .
can she call you back ?
who is it ?
no one . i &apos;m calling myself .
yes . thank you .
ms. smulders .
hello . i &apos;m alicia florrick .
yes , mrs. florrick ,
i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t call ahead .
it &apos;s just i ... i need a lawyer now , this afternoon .
should i take notes , mrs. florrick ?
no , thank you . i &apos;m good .
i &apos;ll hold your calls .
yes , please .
so , ms. smulders , why do you need a lawyer this afternoon ?
my mother died .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no . it was last week , but she didn &apos;t leave a will .
it shouldn &apos;t be contentious .
there &apos;s only two of us .
it &apos;s my brother and myself , and my mother
had put tack @-@ on notes on everything to make sure
that there wouldn &apos;t be any disputes over who got what .
my mother doesn &apos;t have a lot of valuable things ,
but she was a friend of marc chagall &apos;s wife , valentina ,
and she had given her a signed print .
a signed chagall ?
do you know what it &apos;s worth ?
$ 8 million .
i see . um ...
who &apos;s your brother &apos;s lawyer ?
alicia . what a surprise .
david . spreading your cheer far and wide , i see .
i thought you were working as a bond court pimp .
what are you doing here ?
multitasking .
i heard you lost your top four clients .
no . three clients , and they weren &apos;t top .
too bad this will be a clean dissolution of assets .
it &apos;d be fun to get down in the muck together .
oh , i have a feeling you &apos;ll find a way
to get down in the muck on this chagall .
oh , here &apos;s our executor now .
hello , mr. dandy .
handy .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . here .
let me help you with that , mr. handy .
as the executor , i &apos;ll photograph the placement
of mrs. smulders &apos; tack @-@ on notes on her valuables ,
and if there is any disagreement ,
i will be the final arbiter . are we agreed ?
this door has not been opened since mrs. smulders &apos; death ,
and this is the only key , so ...
here we go . it &apos;ll be my note or yours .
great . they all fell off .
what is that ?
a smoothie .
you don &apos;t drink smoothies .
i know . i &apos;m changing , like a butterfly .
good meeting ?
yeah .
ruth eastman gives us second place in iowa .
second place in iowa gives us street cred .
and street cred gives us a hearing with hillary .
and that is why i am drinking a smoothie .
eli . hi .
hi .
you two are meeting already ?
yeah .
so , uh , let eli and i talk , and then when we &apos;re done , mm @-@ hmm .
maybe you two can get together and have a conversation . good ?
good . uh , i want everything to be copacetic here .
i hate contention .
why would there be contention , peter ?
have a seat , have a seat .
no , i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good . why @-@ why @-@ why contention ?
ruth has agreed to come on board .
and she has a campaign strategy
that is ... very good .
good . good .
i think
i think she partially believes in me . but , more importantly ,
she dislikes the clintons .
how long has she been here ?
uh , about an hour .
i was just with her an hour ago .
you were the one on the phone offering her a job .
my job ?
eli , it &apos;s a national campaign ,
and i need a national strategist .
oh , my god , you &apos;re firing me .
no , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not .
whatever happened to loyalty ?
this isn &apos;t about loyalty .
i got you here .
you wouldn &apos;t be here without me .
oh , now , wait a minute ...
no , no . when you were polling nothing ,
when you were banging your ethics coordinator--
your freakin &apos; ethics coordinator-- i stuck by you !
i cleaned up your mess .
prostitutes , groupies , alicia ...
don &apos;t go there .
i was the one freakin &apos; set of footprints in the sand !
eli , this is not about you .
this is about me trying to reach the middle class ,
and i need her to do it !
are you insane ? !
are you so narcissistic you can &apos;t see
you &apos;re stabbing me in the back ?
i see a political operative who has a very inflated sense of his own worth .
go to hell , peter !
all right , you should go home .
i was gonna ask you to stay and be chief of staff
in the governor &apos;s office ...
uh , no .
but you know what i am gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna find someone to run against you .
you just lost your greatest asset and made your worst enemy .
when does this partner meeting start , huh ?
my back is killing me .
it &apos;s these chairs .
we need better lumbar support .
god , my butt . it &apos;s like sitting at a ball game .
hey , a little quiet , please , huh ?
can &apos;t you see we &apos;re working here ?
everything good ?
yeah . sorry about the noise , mr. agos .
uh , you don &apos;t ... you don &apos;t have to call me mr. agos .
you know , one thing i wanted to get going
was an associate social .
so maybe one night this week we can ...
how you doing , kids ?
mr. lyman , how &apos;s it going ?
oh , come on . none of that mr. lyman stuff .
just call me howie .
howie , hmm ?
how you doing ?
i love that shirt .
we have a court time at 3 : 00 p.m. today , alicia ,
and i am not gonna get into a fight on this .
don &apos;t lay it on so thick .
let &apos;s agree to a 50 % split on all assets ,
including the chagall .
fine with me . see you then .
sorry .
hey , look who &apos;s back .
you were wrong .
schakowsky freezes her out
one more time , she &apos;ll run off crying .
i don &apos;t know .
what do you mean you don &apos;t know ?
she doesn &apos;t look like she &apos;ll quit .
right , like her s.a. run .
she stuck that one out . never quit .
good morning .
we had a very full lockup
here today , so let &apos;s all work together
and we &apos;ll get through this with some alacrity .
how many bar attorneys do i have today ?
four , your honor .
ms. quinn , you have 25 males .
mr. bukovitz , 18 .
and , mr. weingarten , 20 . get up here .
it was a full moon last night . we had an influx of arrests .
so keep it moving .
what ?
for the purposes of speed ,
your honor , i would suggest giving five
of my sheets to mrs. florrick .
what ?
why would i do that ?
i don &apos;t think i can carry this load
with the speed you require .
you &apos;ve done it before .
yeah , but i don &apos;t think i can today .
she slows me down ,
it &apos;s your problem , lucca .
i &apos;m not joking .
make sure she keeps up .
mrs. florrick ,
come on up here , please .
yes , your honor .
six cases .
don &apos;t slow me down , you hear me ?
thank you , your honor .
and if the meaning of &quot; alacrity &quot; escapes anyone ...
thanks .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
389 . assault and battery .
thank you , mr. banner .
can you tell me about the charges , please ?
yeah . i didn &apos;t do it .
i didn &apos;t punch that bus driver .
what happened ?
well , i was just going to see my wife . she ...
works at the hospital as a nurse .
damn it , matan !
and i go to see her for dinner . we just go down to the ...
cafeteria on her break .
about the bus driver , sir ?
right , i &apos;m getting to that .
my wife only gets 45 minutes for dinner ,
and if i don &apos;t get there right at 8 : 00,
alicia , can i talk to you for a second ?
we don &apos;t get to have dinner ...
you don &apos;t ask open @-@ ended questions .
you ask yes or no questions and only about bail .
yeah , but i need to know his story .
no , you don &apos;t .
in one minute , the judge is gonna call that client &apos;s name ,
and you &apos;ll have to argue why he deserves bail .
if you &apos;re not ready , he goes to the back of the heap .
josiah , uh , do you have a job ?
well , like , sometimes i work for my brother at his auto shop .
it &apos;s not ...
and your family ,
they depend on your job ,
on the money your job brings in ?
well , you know , sometimes i ...
just a yes or no answer , please .
it &apos;s not a yes or no answer .
come on , let &apos;s go .
male 19 , assault .
what do you have , asa ?
assault and battery . with two bfws for failure to appear .
uh , he is a danger to the public and a flight risk .
okay , got it . uh , mrs. florrick ,
mitigation ?
uh , yes , your honor . mr. banner &apos;s family--
his wife and his children ... uh , his child--
depends on his salary at , um , an auto body shop that he works at .
and his other bfws , well , they ...
give me just one second , your honor ...
mr. banner , your bail is set at $ 500,000 .
what ?
excuse me , your honor , that &apos;s too much .
you need $ 50,000 to get out of jail .
i can &apos;t afford that .
well , then you &apos;ll be held until trial .
august 5 , branch 44 .
next up , male 19,
drunk and disorderly .
just move on to the next , now .
... obstructing traffic in wicker park .
the state requests $ 20,000 bail .
damn it , matan ,
if you don &apos;t have the jacket on the dui ...
uh , william r. johnson .
dui ?
you okay ?
i had six clients ; four are still behind bars .
what do you think ?
we &apos;re not in the miracle @-@ working business .
it &apos;s an assembly line .
keep the court moving-- that &apos;s all .
here &apos;s the other thing . you didn &apos;t make any money today .
yes , i did .
i had six cases . $ 135 a case .
no . none of them &apos;s gonna pay you .
you have to get &apos; em to check this box on their sheet .
it allows the county to send the $ 135 refunded bail straight to you .
that &apos;s how you get paid .
that &apos;s how you don &apos;t get cheated .
otherwise , no one &apos;ll send you any money .
you catch on . it just takes a while .
yeah .
uh , damn it . i @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m minutes away .
oh , i see we have the small court today .
72 degrees , please , sheriff . thank you .
this is supposed to be a relatively easy probate .
what are we waiting on ?
not on us , your honor .
we &apos;re ready .
me .
your honor , excuse me . i &apos;m just coming from bond court .
we &apos;re ready , too . due to the loss of tack @-@ on notes ,
mrs. smulders has agreed to a fifty @-@ fifty division
of all assets .
wise .
good . mr. lee ?
we would disagree that the notes are lost , your honor .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , but given the fact
that a heat wave caused the notes to fall and are now
spread across the floor of mrs. smulders &apos; house ,
i would call that lost .
we would like to call a witness , your honor .
dr. ian caine , adhesive expert
at solvent and curables lab .
you &apos;re what ?
an adhesive expert .
really ? that &apos;s a job ?
yes , it is , your honor .
dr. caine , did you have an opportunity
to examine the notes in mrs. smulders &apos; house ?
yes , i did .
pressure sensitive adhesives . simple and imperfect .
and did you find anything relevant to this case ?
yes .
every adhesive retains some trace of the surface
it comes in contact with .
we call that &quot; pressure sensitive contact release . &quot;
and did you do a chemical study
of the adhesive on this specific note ?
yes . it had traces
of dutch gold leaf on its adhesive strip .
your honor , objection , we &apos;ve had no access to this testing .
well , give them access now .
there is a painting in mrs. smulders &apos; house ,
a chagall original .
did you happen to study
the chemicals on its gilded frame ?
yes , it &apos;s been painted with dutch gold leaf .
nothing further , your honor .
thank you . i &apos;m sure you want some extra time
to go over that report , mrs. florrick .
yes , your honor , but i do have a few questions .
dr. caine , i see that there are other chemicals
on this note &apos;s adhesive . what are they ?
荷兰金箔残留成分
house dust mites .
various lead compounds . human hair .
from the carpet in the room ?
yes . exactly .
it &apos;s to be expected .
i also see
that one of the desk lamps in mrs. smulders &apos; house
is made of lead . you see that one here ?
yes .
is it possible
that the lead on the adhesive
didn &apos;t come from the carpet
but came from the lamp ?
yes . it &apos;s possible .
but it still had gold leaf on it .
that means that the note came from the frame .
but if mrs. smulders changed her mind
and moved the note from the chagall to the lamp ,
oh , come on !
would the note have both compounds on it ?
yes , it would .
thank you .
i need an aerodynamics expert .
they &apos;re going after science .
okay .
i &apos;ll ask uncle owen if he knows anyone .
and can you tell eli i &apos;ll be ten minutes late for the interview ?
yes . calling now .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re coming after me so hard .
two name partners . expert witnesses .
you think it &apos;s just happenstance
that you have a case across from us ?
mr. governor , it &apos;s so good to see you .
ted willoughby .
you , too , ted .
me , too , ted ?
it &apos;s good to see you , too .
they warned me about your wit .
ah , mrs. florrick . hello , i &apos;m ruth eastman .
oh , hello . sorry i &apos;m late .
um , i tried calling eli ,
but he didn &apos;t answer .
oh , there @-@ there &apos;s been a slight change .
we &apos;re going ahead with this interview ,
but we &apos;re delaying the announcement till next week .
why is that ?
it &apos;s a smarter move .
why is that the smarter move ?
we can raise more funds if peter isn &apos;t a candidate yet .
now , i &apos;ll be getting you a chief of staff
to coordinate with the campaign .
i ... um , where &apos;s eli ?
oh , he @-@ he &apos;s no longer with the campaign .
i &apos;m ruth eastman , the new campaign manager .
don &apos;t worry .
eli &apos;s very good , but i have a more national presence .
and i think you &apos;ll see we have a lot in common .
would you excuse me for a moment ?
peter , what the hell ?
it &apos;s a national campaign , alicia .
i need a campaign manager with a national strategy .
you need someone who cares .
eli cared .
caring is not enough .
he doesn &apos;t know the state .
he doesn &apos;t know the people .
he knows you .
he &apos;s loyal to you .
alicia .
right from the beginning ,
you wanted nothing to do with this campaign .
you can &apos;t come in now and pretend that you have a voice .
this is my choice .
it &apos;s a hard choice . it &apos;s the hardest choice
i &apos;ve ever had to make , but it &apos;s mine .
and i don &apos;t need you coming in now and scolding me .
my gosh ,
it &apos;s good to see you two smiling and laughing .
mrs. florrick ,
if your husband does run ,
why should voters vote for him ?
well , um , loyalty .
he &apos;s loyal to his family .
his friends .
he sticks with people .
i think alicia &apos;s being very kind .
obviously a candidate has to be loyal ,
but he &apos;s got to be smart .
balance is everything .
yes , balance . and sticking to your word .
that &apos;s what voters want most in a candidate .
well , i know that &apos;s what i want .
that and ...
can i have a beer with him ?
eli , it &apos;s me . it &apos;s alicia .
eli , you &apos;re not answering your phone .
we need to talk .
eli , i can hear your movie .
eli .
i heard . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay , i &apos;m fine .
but thanks .
eli , wait .
no , i just need to be done with it , alicia .
i @-@ i ... i was never your friend .
i was just a political operative . i was the help .
and , uh ... i need to be done . that &apos;s it .
no , no , no , we wait for alicia to present her witness .
no , i ... david , i disagree .
and then we use it as a rebuttal .
we don &apos;t wait for her to present her witness--
don &apos;t you understand what i &apos;m ...
she &apos;s going to get ahead of the argument .
she &apos;s not gonna get ahead of the argument .
we don &apos;t let her take the offensive .
no .
right now ...
okay , i don &apos;t think you understand
the way i &apos;m thinking about this , obvious ...
all right .
explain it to me .
she will present her witness ,
then we will use the ...
why are we letting her
present her witness first ?
right @-@ right now , we are ...
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to explain to you .
would you let me finish ?
so , you guys happy at work ?
yeah .
seriously ,
if you have any complaints , i &apos;m here , i &apos;m listening .
well , i pitched to the partners a new way to bill the clients .
but ...
but what ? they said no ?
they wouldn &apos;t listen .
all the new firms are using it .
but the worry i have is , lockhart / agos
is seen as an older firm .
not as friendly to new ideas .
well , tell me what the idea is .
dr. douglas dooley .
aerodynamics expert from chicago polytech .
were you able to investigate the fall pattern
of the notes below the chagall painting ?
she &apos;s got to be kidding .
tack @-@ on notes fall in a limited way
because they are denser than air .
they flutter ,
but they will never flutter more than 30 degrees
from the starting point .
this is the falling cone .
so if we were to look at a photo
of mrs. smulders &apos;s residence ,
we would be able to determine what notes could not
have fallen from the chagall painting ?
yes , those falling out of this area .
that is the 30 @-@ degree cone of falling trajectory
from any spot on the painting .
dr. nigel buggy .
i &apos;m an industrial suction expert
with ames institute .
okay , now you &apos;re just making these jobs up .
dr. buggy , did you read dr. dooley &apos;s testimony ?
wh ... uh , dr. dooley-- was he the tape guy ?
no , fall pattern .
yes , i did .
i mean , dr. dooley &apos;s opinion only holds
if the scene were undisturbed .
and what in your opinion disturbed the scene ?
this .
i need you to find out everything you can about roombas .
they &apos;re allowing mrs. smulders &apos; roomba into evidence .
okay , i &apos;m on their web site now .
what might alter a programmable route for a roomba ?
oh , that &apos;s my call waiting . i &apos;ll call you back .
hello ?
alicia florrick ?
yes , hello .
it &apos;s lucca quinn .
i need you to step in for me .
um , i don &apos;t understand .
i have a deposition this afternoon .
i need someone to cover for me in bond court .
bar attorneys stick together , mrs. florrick .
we cover for each other .
what time do you need me ?
1 : 00 to 4 : 00 .
you &apos;ll be the only attorney , so i &apos;ll need you there .
okay , but i have to be in probate court at 4 : 30 .
shouldn &apos;t be a problem . thanks .
eli , this isn &apos;t healthy .
snow nazis ?
come on , make some calls .
it &apos;ll make you happy .
good . w @-@ who can i call ?
there you go .
where are you going ?
i highlighted the part that matters .
thank you , grace .
can i stay and watch ?
definitely .
thanks .
eli . hello .
alicia .
you got a haircut .
it &apos;s sleek .
i wanted to apologize .
obviously , i was very upset ,
but i should never have said that to you .
it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
you never made me feel like the help .
and i always flattered myself to think i was ...
almost a friend .
so my apologies .
accepted .
that &apos;s why i want to be your chief of staff .
you &apos;re gonna need a chief of staff .
someone to coordinate with the main campaign .
and it &apos;s better if you work with someone you know .
eli , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll have a choice in this .
i can make this work for you .
whoever ruth hires will make your life harder .
and it &apos;s not an easy job--
they &apos;re going to want to rehabilitate you .
rehabilitate me ?
from your failed campaign last year , from your scandal .
they need to make you a wife again .
doctor ,
you &apos;ve shown us how the programmable roomba
would have pushed a clyde note
under the chagall painting .
but isn &apos;t it true that this machine &apos;s programmed path
could be disrupted ?
i don &apos;t ... uh , understand .
doesn &apos;t the instruction manual say
that a low battery causes a roomba to stop what it &apos;s doing
and return back to the base station ?
oh , yes .
sheriff , please .
your honor , we haven &apos;t been prepared for this .
can you bring that roomba back over here ?
we need to get a better look at it .
let &apos;s see if the battery level &apos;s low .
okay , where do i look ?
that gauge there ...
um , your honor ?
do you see something sticking out there ?
yes , another tack @-@ on note .
doctor , could you untangle that thing ?
selena .
who &apos;s selena ?
our housekeeper .
we need to get to the housekeeper .
but how do i do that ?
well , we need to hire an investigator . by the hour .
damn it , i have to get to bond court .
but i thought that was tomorrow .
no , i told another attorney i &apos;d help her out .
you know what , i &apos;ll ask for investigator references there ...
mrs. florrick .
can i drop you someplace ?
i think we got off on the wrong foot , alicia .
i actually have a very good bedside manner .
well , peter seems happy . that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
i want you to be happy , too .
we &apos;ll be needing to get you in front of a few key people .
to rehabilitate me ?
yes .
we hopefully won &apos;t eat up too much of your time ,
but we need the voters to see the real you .
i &apos;m not sure they &apos;ll like the real me .
that &apos;s why we need to mold a real you that they &apos;ll like .
i &apos;ll be hiring you a chief of staff .
someone discreet .
oh , i @-@ i already have one .
you do ? a chief of staff ?
yes .
who ?
eli gold .
no , unfortunately , um ,
that won &apos;t work .
why not ?
well , it &apos;s too soon .
um , i want you to meet a few other options .
no , i &apos;m good with eli .
mrs. florrick , you &apos;re not paying for this . the campaign is .
yes , and they &apos;re not paying for me .
i &apos;m volunteering .
are you suggesting you wouldn &apos;t be involved
in your husband &apos;s campaign ?
yes , actually , i am .
it was good to talk to you . this is where i get out .
if you want to find your own attorneys ,
you &apos;ll have to wait till tonight after the bond hearing .
i don &apos;t get involved with the fees .
so you will make arrangements with your own
bar attorney .
mrs. florrick ,
please approach .
are you serious ?
you &apos;re the only bar attorney here today ?
stepping in for ms. quinn , your honor .
you keep this moving , or you won &apos;t be in here again .
yes , your honor .
mr. lancaster , i don &apos;t need to know whether you did it or not .
i just need to know about this previous arrest .
you &apos;ll see on your copy ,
you need to check this box for your refunded bail money
to come to me .
otherwise , i can &apos;t help you .
i &apos;m sorry , sir , but we don &apos;t have much time .
just nod if you can &apos;t get your words out .
male 63 .
driving under the influence .
this was mr. baptiste &apos;s second dui , your honor .
we would ask for substantial bail .
he is a 40 @-@ year @-@ old who , um , did public service .
his record was expunged .
he was driving 85 miles in a 40 @-@ mile lane .
bail granted . $ 1,500 .
male 64 . drug trafficking .
second offense , your honor .
two bond forfeiture warrants .
mitigation ?
did you need any more time , mrs. florrick ?
oh , no , just , um , just a moment to find the page , your honor .
your honor , mr. wheeler isn &apos;t learning .
we ask for $ 750,000 in bail .
he is a single father of four .
the children have no one else .
he is a drug dealer who was unrepentant .
first of all , he didn &apos;t do it .
selling crack
within 50 yards of a school .
second of all , child services
will take his children away .
$ 100,000 bail , mr. wheeler .
unless you can pay ,
you will be held until trial .
your honor , we ask that you reconsider .
male 65 .
probation violation . mrs. florrick , can i speak with you ?
don &apos;t you dare slow me down again .
you keep doing that , and i will tax your clients .
now step back .
octagon is a data visualization technique
that communicates eight key metrics
in an octagon @-@ shaped digital and hard graphic .
as you can see from the handouts ,
it &apos;s a way of finding graphical means to communicate
complex multivariable data
in a format that requires the end user
to have very little technical training .
each end @-@ user gets a new updated octagon every month .
i don &apos;t get it .
why can &apos;t we just do what we do ?
because this is a way to become more efficient .
the newer firms are using it .
i don &apos;t see the use , cary .
we need to listen to new ideas .
and we did .
this firm is becoming a laughingstock .
where ?
we &apos;re seen as being old and out of touch .
the associates don &apos;t think we listen to them .
we need to change .
the only question , sir , is bail at this point .
i don &apos;t need ...
mrs. florrick ,
please approach .
you have to stay .
i don &apos;t have another bar attorney .
step back .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , i can &apos;t .
i have an inheritance matter in probate court .
i don &apos;t care . you &apos;re here .
you &apos;re staying .
lucca , you need to get here now .
i need to get to probate in ten minutes .
where &apos;s don ?
i don &apos;t know , but you need to get here now .
i &apos;m too far away .
where &apos;s probate court ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m lucca quinn .
alicia asked me to step in just to get a continuance .
where is she ?
okay , where are we ?
are we going to hear from a scissors expert today ?
your honor , we actually have at our table
mrs. smulders &apos; housekeeper , selina abarca .
they must have made a deal with her .
your honor , i &apos;m lucca quinn .
i &apos;m acting on behalf of mrs. florrick
to ask for a continuance .
your honor , this is a stalling tactic .
uh , mrs. florrick is not stalling .
she &apos;s been held up at the bond court .
really ? she finds the bond court more important than us ?
not important , your honor . she &apos;s ...
the judge is not allowing her ...
what does this housekeeper have to say ?
it &apos;s actually what our expert has to say
about her tack @-@ on note .
expert . you know , i thought we were gonna get by
at least ten minutes without an expert .
your honor , i must again ask for a continuance .
i am not privy to all of mrs. florrick &apos;s thinking on this .
oh , that &apos;s too bad . sit back down .
do you know anything about this ?
in examining this new pressure @-@ sensitive adhesive ,
i found more dutch gold leaf .
the same imitation gold leaf from the chagall frame ?
荷兰金箔残留成分
that is correct .
and there was nothing else .
no lead from the lamp or the rug ?
no .
meaning ms. abarca &apos;s note
had to fall from the chagall painting ?
that &apos;s correct .
you should object .
objection , your honor .
relevance ?
good guess . no .
your honor ,
we believe that the chagall painting
was left to mrs. smulders &apos; housekeeper , selina abarca ,
and we ask that your honor rule .
does counselor have anything ?
again we ask for a continuance , your honor .
ms. lockhart has made a very strong argument .
i am prone to reward this housekeeper the inheritance
unless there &apos;s anything more .
your honor .
counselor , i have already ruled .
there is not gonna be a continuance .
i understand .
i just wanted to be clear .
that lady is the housekeeper to the deceased ?
yes . why ?
and this is about an inheritance ?
yes , it is . you catch on quickly .
and was the deceased an invalid ?
she was in a wheelchair . why ?
and i &apos;m guessing this asset , this @-@ this painting ,
was worth more than $ 20,000 .
yes , it is . $ 8 million . again , why ?
the housekeeper can &apos;t inherit it .
of course she can .
no .
according to illinois law ,
a caretaker to an invalid
cannot inherit more than $ 20,000 .
dismissed .
okay , fifty @-@ fifty . we &apos;ll be in touch .
working late ?
almost done .
so ... have some bad news .
the partners didn &apos;t really get octagon .
yeah , i didn &apos;t think they did .
i could see their faces .
but i don &apos;t want you to give up on pitching new things ,
so just come to me , and i &apos;ll walk it in with you , okay ?
okay . thanks .
if you ever need anything , just ... i &apos;m here .
just talk to me .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought ...
no .
uh , just the way you were talking ...
no . no , i wasn &apos;t ...
this was about opening up to the younger associates , that &apos;s all .
okay . sorry .
what are you doing , eli ?
what am i doing ?
packing .
nice haircut .
thanks .
no .
what are you doing with mrs. florrick ?
she doesn &apos;t just get it into her head
to keep you on as chief of staff .
i &apos;m pretty irresistible .
you &apos;re not getting that job , eli .
i will make it a prerequisite of my employment .
i get to hire the wife &apos;s chief of staff .
good . that sounds smart .
what do you know ?
ruth , you and i don &apos;t have time
to tell each other lies , so let &apos;s not .
i plan to use alicia &apos;s rehabilitation campaign
to undercut you and eventually destroy you .
i may even destroy peter in the process .
not quite sure about that yet .
well , thanks for your honesty .
what if i inform peter ?
i will , of course , deny it .
you will again tell him i &apos;m out to hurt you .
he will think you &apos;re being paranoid and distracted
by something that has nothing to do with the campaign .
you planned it all out .
not quite all but ...
enough .
talk to you soon .
sooner than you think , eli .
thanks again .
eh , all i did was vamp .
it was good vamping .
what do you want ?
a beer .
so , how long have you been a lawyer ?
i &apos;m gonna go dance .
what ?
there &apos;s a dance floor . i &apos;m gonna go dance .
with who ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ll find someone .
excuse me .
hey , watch it .
notice , i didn &apos;t say &quot; sorry . &quot;
&quot; excuse me &quot; is just about as bad .
good job with the smulder case .
thanks . are you following me ?
no .
you just happen to be at this bar ?
okay , i followed you from court .
she is really good .
so , why &apos;d you give me the case ?
what makes you think i gave it to you ?
i didn &apos;t at first .
i thought madeline found my web site .
but then diane suggested that you were using me as a pawn against them .
why would she say that ?
because you &apos;re the devil .
all i was doing was sending you some work ,
keep you from starving ,
until you come to your senses and decide to join my firm .
you &apos;ll still be an independent . you &apos;ll still be your own woman .
you won &apos;t even work for me .
unless you want me to stop sending you cases .
do you want me to stop ?
no .
