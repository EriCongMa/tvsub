&quot; crazy love &quot;
love .
neuroscience tells us
it activates the same parts of the brain
as habit @-@ forming addiction .
it makes us feel like we can do anything ,
be anything , achieve anything .
and once we taste it ...
... we want more .
you want to go again ?
i guess not . bailey &apos;s up .
what if i change my flight ?
i could come by the hospital before i get to the airport ,
and we could find - an empty on @-@ call room and ...
i have work to do at work .
i can &apos;t do you , too .
okay , well , then it &apos;s settled .
let &apos;s go again now . come on .
no ! absolutely not ! you are terrible !
come here .
terrible influence !
we are getting up now .
come on .
i know .
what ?
why don &apos;t you make yourself useful
and go change bailey &apos;s diaper ?
you &apos;re a tease .
and you are terrible !
have you seen my phone ?
it &apos;s in your hand .
not this one . this one &apos;s mine .
the government one , the one i have to return .
i don &apos;t know where i put it .
couch cushions ?
hey , zola , hurry up , honey ,
or you won &apos;t have time to eat breakfast !
are you nervous ?
it &apos;s not like you go to prison if you don &apos;t return the phone .
i mean , i don &apos;t go to prison for that , right ?
no , i meant resigning .
giving up your job isn &apos;t a small thing to do .
well , it is . in comparison to everything here , it is .
but -- - meredith , i meet with the president &apos;s council in the morning .
i give them my final report ,
my official recommendation , and then i &apos;m done .
i &apos;ll be home before you know it .
it &apos;s good . it &apos;s time .
oh ! hey !
you &apos;re ... here .
yeah , we live here .
but you had a flight .
and you -- yesterday you were going on and on
about some early surgery that you had .
the point is , you &apos;re not supposed to be home .
so ...
my surgery got pushed , and ...
uh , weren &apos;t you wearing that yesterday ?
amelia , you forgot your ce--
i was just , um ...
her -- her cellphone was --
thank you .
yeah .
who wants breakfast ? anybody ?
we have coffee .
well , i should ...
uh , yeah , um , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna go .
hey , little guy !
look who &apos;s here !
want to go find your sister ?
all right . let &apos;s go .
so , your sister and owen ?
she told me last night .
you knew ?
your sister &apos;s doing owen and you didn &apos;t tell me ?
i was supposed to tell you that ?
yes !
i don &apos;t even remember where i put my phone .
now i have to remember someone else &apos;s sex life ?
i got to get to --
i &apos;m gonna be l-- oh , okay .
so , we &apos;re gonna go again , huh ?
oh . hey .
best wife ever .
i just wish , i don &apos;t know , you could stay
or i could come with you or something .
i &apos;ll be back soon . you know that .
i know . i know .
i just feel like i just got you back ,
and now you &apos;re going again ,
and i @-@ i just have to stay here .
you &apos;re right . you do .
you have to ... stay here .
don &apos;t move.wait for me .
i &apos;ll be back before you know it .
okay .
oh ! hey !
did you see that ?
see what ?
it was like he didn &apos;t even see me .
i was supposed to see a guy not see you ?
no , no . we went on a date -- ethan and i.
it was a good date . we had fun .
we talked for hours . we laughed .
but then at the end of the date , there was no kissing .
and you &apos;re pissed .
no , there wasn &apos;t even an attempt at kissing .
see , you &apos;re pissed if we try ,
you &apos;re pissed if we don &apos;t try .
no , but then no phone call , no text ,
no , &quot; hey , second date ? &quot;
and now he is actively not seeing me .
hmm , i &apos;m actively not seeing my cop anymore .
you guys went out already ?
yep . we went out on a date . it was bad .
well , at first , it wasn &apos;t that bad .
he was all , &quot; i save lives , and i wear a uniform . &quot;
and then i realized - i save lives , i wear a uniform ,
and i &apos;m not boring .
no second date for him .
okay , so , uh , what is it ?
tell me . lay it out .
uh , am i hideous ?
am i -- am i -- do i have bad breath ?
what is the problem here ?
why me ?
because you &apos;re a guy .
exactly . i &apos;m a guy .
just tell me .
go away !
so , you and owen ...
is there an end to that ?
i don &apos;t know . you tell me .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
um , owen and i ...
a @-@ are getting to know each other .
how well ?
&quot; pants on &quot; or &quot; pants off &quot; well ?
is it just sex , or is there something more ?
meredith , what is this ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m asking you .
i don &apos;t know what we are yet .
okay , well , that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of .
listen , cristina asked me to watch out for him .
i promised i would ,
so i just want to make sure that --
that i don &apos;t ruin him ?
is that what you mean ?
that you &apos;re careful for your sake and for his .
uh , i am on your service today .
you got anything good ?
ooh , is that a split spine ?
a complete spondylolisthesis ?
is that what we &apos;re doing today ?
no .
oh , okay .
well , then , what are we doing ?
nothing . - you and i are doing nothing .
i don &apos;t want a resident today .
i don &apos;t need company , so you should go .
but i &apos;m on your service --
for the love of god , just do something else
and stop bugging me .
marissa mckay--
arrived complaining of severe lower back pain .
her pediatrician dismissed it
as a combination of growing pains
and soreness from athletic activity .
marissa &apos;s one of the best junior golfers in the country .
the -- the best .
it &apos;s true .
first place in the njgas last year .
marissa , honey -- - what ?
coach rubin said
there &apos;s no apologies for being excellent .
and i am -- i &apos;m excellent . what &apos;s wrong with that ?
absolutely nothing .
however , your x @-@ ray does show
a severe misalignment of your spine right here , okay ?
it &apos;s supposed to look straight like a piece of bamboo .
but yours is completely bent . see that zigzag ?
you &apos;ve seen swinging a club with this ?
i try to tell her to take it easy , but , uh ...
you &apos;ve been pushing through the pain .
if i played football or soccer , you wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
you &apos;d be impressed .
i haven &apos;t lost a tournament in four years .
i &apos;m up for five athletic scholarships at schools
none of my genius friends can even get accepted to .
so , what can we do to fix her spine ?
well , dr. torres and i will have to do a few more tests
before we can come up with a plan of attack .
as long as it doesn &apos;t affect my game , i &apos;m in .
we will see what we can figure out .
excuse us .
she just kicked you off the case ?
no , first she bit my head off for no reason .
sometimes she can be a little crazy ,
and i just don &apos;t know if i &apos;m equipped to work under crazy !
oh , wah .
the new neuro @-@ god &apos;s protege
can &apos;t handle a little inconsistency .
shut up
so maybe you &apos;re not shepherd &apos;s protege .
maybe herman &apos;s surgery was a one @-@ time thing .
have you thought about other options besides neuro ?
what do you feel really good about ?
that &apos;s the problem .
i &apos;m really good at everything .
help ! please ! help us !
he &apos;s hurt ! we need a doctor ! somebody !
it &apos;s okay ! i &apos;ve got you , chef !
sir , you need to let go
so we can see where the bleeding is !
ahh ! my wife !
here . take this .
sir , please hold still .
my wife .
your wife is fine , sir . just hold still .
here .
okay . please lie back down .
we need to check out this cut .
my wife !
were you and your husband in an accident ?
he &apos;s not my husband . - here . just --
edwards , anything ?
no , no visible abdominal wounds .
sir , would you please let us --
my wife !
we can call your wife .
no !
no !
my wife cut off my penis .
here .
well , that &apos;s a big one .
oh , god !
let &apos;s run a cbc chem 7
and get 2 units of blood ready to go .
what &apos;s the penis status ?
dorsal veins look good .
get it debrided and in saline gauze quickly .
oh , god !
more pain meds ! fentanyl 150 iv .
and we need to pack him . cellulose polymer . gauze !
and as you can see ,
dr. kepner is doing the groin tourniquet method
as i was telling you about ,
and dr. edwards is attending to the severed ... appendage .
bleeding &apos;s under control for now ,
but we &apos;re gonna need a specialist to reattach .
catherine avery &apos;s on the west coast
at a conference - in san francisco this week .
i thought i &apos;d see if she could come up .
is she good ?
she &apos;s very good , but so is dr. mcmurdo
in our urology department here .
call him instead .
the urethra is very ragged .
catherine &apos;s skin flap reattachment technique
would greatly increase the odds of a successful reattachment .
well , then i want that !
i want the one - with the superior technique !
i &apos;ve worked with subpar technicians ,
line cooks - who couldn &apos;t put out a plate .
i assure you , dr. mcmurdo knows all the techniques .
okay , but i -- - all right , everybody .
let &apos;s give them some room to work , okay ? let &apos;s go .
have you finished prepping the phallus ?
just about .
okay , then i need you to get it to jackson a.s.a.p.
while everything is still viable .
every second we wait , more healthy flesh dies .
he &apos;s in procedure room four . he knows you &apos;re coming . go !
excuse me ! pardon me !
that &apos;s a hell of a gash .
did his wife do this , too ?
sort of .
i was the one who found thomas .
and i went to put my knives down at my station ,
and there he was , lying in a pool of blood .
he wasn &apos;t moving . i didn &apos;t know if he was alive or dead .
i ran over , and it was so slippery ,
i fell , too , and hit my face on the damn induction range .
marcia is a crazy woman .
she &apos;s not crazy .
she attacked you and injured you badly .
i know , but i don &apos;t want to call the police .
i don &apos;t want to press charges .
excuse me ! pardon me ! move , move !
coming through ! coming through !
thomas didn &apos;t deserve this .
all those great reviews are not because of her .
marcia is an owner . thomas archibald is an artist .
i can &apos;t let this get out .
bad for business .
wait . thomas archibald , as in the thomas archibald ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve been trying to get a reservation
at that place for months .
he &apos;s on his way up , and he &apos;s taking me with him .
i &apos;m his sous @-@ chef .
marcia is trying to destroy everything .
uh , okay .
and by the way , it wasn &apos;t an accident
that after she cut it off ,
she dumped it into the stock pot at my station .
you know what happened .
do you want to eat food from my kitchen now ?
so ...
are you two together ?
will it still work ...
after they put it back on ?
coming through ! move !
watch out !
hey ! slow down !
she has a temper .
she &apos;s insane .
she &apos;s not a criminal .
she should be locked up .
but she won &apos;t hurt me again .
i &apos;m here . i got it .
i got your package -- i mean , your patient .
the penis .
your patient &apos;s penis .
in the package .
i mean , not your penis .
can you give it to me ?
you already irrigated the urethra and the vessels ?
yeah , in the trauma room .
nice work .
that makes a big difference with dismemberments like this .
sure . no problem . it wasn &apos;t hard .
i mean , it &apos;s not a big thing .
i mean , it was easy . i was just in and out .
okay .
yeah , okay .
i &apos;m gonna go now .
please .
let &apos;s get p.a. and lateral chest x @-@ rays .
and , you , sit tight ,
and we will figure out what &apos;s going on , okay ?
will you go get those films for me ?
why ?
oh , right . &apos; cause the radiologist doesn &apos;t like you .
maybe no one likes me .
maybe i &apos;m unlikable .
and i will die alone , and my vagina will dry up
and grow brittle and turn to dust
and just blow away in a soft breeze .
and no one will know .
oh , god .
i know . i &apos;m hideous . i &apos;m a troll .
all my orgasms are gonna be self @-@ made , handcrafted ones .
i &apos;m all i got .
dr. webber , did you always know
you were gonna do general surgery ?
uh , i knew pretty early on , yeah .
okay , but how did you know it was the right place for you ?
did you ever consider anything else ?
how did you choose it ?
well , i guess i didn &apos;t , really .
it chose me .
uh , the -- the patient was a 54 @-@ year @-@ old man .
a small bowel obstruction -- nothing out of the ordinary .
my attending allowed me to resect , and ...
that &apos;s when it happened .
the clamps were in , cuts had been made .
i reached into the body cavity ,
past the omentum , around the liver ,
and lifted the intestinal loops
from that living , breathing body .
and that &apos;s when i knew .
i mean , holding those --
those loops of intestines in my hand --
the weight , the warmth --
i looked down - at that miracle in my hand ,
and ... i just knew .
general surgery had chosen me .
well , one day , you &apos;ll know , too .
so , i &apos;m seeing two rods on either side of the spine
to preserve nerve root function .
yeah , no , i get that . i get it .
i can do a graft on two levels .
but then i can place a frozen graft
directly into the spine
and then add a metal support plate .
that will give her way more stability .
and you &apos;d be severely limiting the range of motion in her spine
when the point is - to keep her swinging , right ?
this defect is so pronounced ,
she might need to let that go .
i don &apos;t know - if i &apos;m ready to let that go .
i mean , you &apos;re looking at gross bone function ,
but not thinking about the subtleties of possible nerve impingement .
no , i think it &apos;s more that i &apos;m looking at
the stability she needs to keep her from being paralyzed ,
and that &apos;s where neuro can sometimes underestimate
the fundamental biomechanics .
and i think that &apos;s where ortho can tend to go a little overboard .
ha , well , we know bones . we do stability .
you guys do brains .
and we do nerves .
that &apos;s why you wouldn &apos;t
hire a carpenter to rewire your house .
what is the real issue here ?
what is this patient after ?
well , she wants to play golf .
no , she &apos;s a teenaged golf prodigy .
totally badass . but unfortunate--
so she wants the maximum preserved mobility we can offer her .
putting her at risk for a far worse injury .
well , it seems like shepherd &apos;s plan works .
chief hunt , i think that her plan underestimates the severity of --
we should do the minimum possible
to maintain the mobility this patient wants
and then work up from there .
right .
well , back to the sawmill for me .
how is it ? !
it was only in the stock pot for two minutes !
okay , good . then i want to see this penis .
but first i want to see the man that it belonged to .
that is a nice , clean cut . hmm .
i keep my knives sharp .
huh . well , it will make reattachment much easier .
will it ever ... work again ?
mr. archibald , i don &apos;t want you to worry .
i &apos;ve reattached many phalluses .
this ... situation is not as uncommon as you might think .
your vessels and nerves are intact ,
so chances are very good that when i &apos;m finished ,
you &apos;ll be able to go right back to doing whatever it is you were doing
before you got yourself into this mess .
jackson &apos;s prepped the phallus ,
and it &apos;s in the o.r. waiting for you .
and i &apos;ll be assisting during surgery .
his corpus cavernosum looks pristine . i &apos;m impressed .
you must have gotten it debrided very quickly .
i ran .
with the penis .
really fast .
following up on what we saw in the e.r. --
dr. avery .
what a surprise .
it can &apos;t be too much of a surprise
considering that i am one of the world &apos;s leading experts
on penile reattachment .
since i happened to be in the neighborhood ,
i just got on the first flight here
as soon as april called .
well , then , how fortunate that she called .
we hope this approach will give her
the mobility she needs to keep playing .
at the same level i was ?
that &apos;s hard to say .
with adequate recovery time and rehab --
state &apos;s coming soon .
how soon will i get my swing back ?
we &apos;ll just see , honey , when they &apos;re done .
right .
we know athletic performance is your priority .
it &apos;s ours , too .
i am gonna do everything i can to get you back on your feet .
and back on the fairway , right ?
you know , it wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing in the world
for you to take a little break , sweetie .
and -- and do what ? go to the mall ?
pick out seven shades of the same stupid red lipstick
like everyone else my age ?
i take time off , i don &apos;t make state .
i don &apos;t make state , forget nationals .
the sooner you fix me , the sooner i &apos;m back on my feet .
let &apos;s do it , dr. shepherd .
sure . you heard her . whatever she &apos;d like .
okay . i &apos;ll see you in there .
catherine .
richard .
where are your minions ?
prepping for my gallbladder removal in o.r. 3 .
you do understand that i &apos;m only here for ...
the man who had this penis cut off ?
of course .
when i heard about it , i thought of you first .
hmm . as you should .
i am his best hope - of being a whole man again .
patient &apos;s very lucky that i was so close .
well , in his position ,
i have a hard time calling him lucky ,
especially given - his regrettable choice in women .
best of luck in there .
and ... here are your chest films .
thank you .
no .
no thank you .
you went on a date with me ,
and you never called me back ,
and i think that is very rude and very hurtful .
and i know that that is a thing that people do sometimes , but ...
people have feelings , you know ?
and maybe you don &apos;t care , but i have feelings .
and , you know , the least you could do
is not ignore me in the hallways
and make me feel like some kind of pariah .
you &apos;re doing it again .
doing what ?
talking .
you never stopped talking .
on our date , even for a second .
you talked the entire time .
from the minute i picked you up
to the minute i dropped you off .
you never shut up .
and amazingly , in all that talking ,
you never asked me one question .
you don &apos;t know a single thing about me .
i didn &apos;t need to be there .
it wasn &apos;t even a date . it was a monologue .
you went on a date with yourself .
and then you paid . you paid .
you did all the talking , you ordered for me ,
and then you paid , so ...
okay .
god , this is so much more severe in person than in the scans .
can these rods hold through l5 ?
no .
th-- shoot .
shoot .
what ?
i can &apos;t torque down the screws .
this won &apos;t keep the vertebrae from slipping apart again .
so , what do we do ?
we need to drill through the sacrum
and into the next vertebrae
and then insert a piece of bone to anchor l5 to s1 .
that sounds like exactly what --
exactly what torres was saying , yes .
yeah , but can you do that ? put in a bone graft ?
no , warren , i can &apos;t . i don &apos;t do bones .
torres does bones , so we need torres .
so , you &apos;re looking at --
i &apos;m looking stupid is what i &apos;m looking ,
but i would rather look stupid than paralyze this girl .
go scrub out and find her .
tell her that i think she &apos;s right and great
and ... smart and pretty .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m saying suck up a little !
it &apos;s gonna take them at least 10 hours to reattach that thing .
and what ? it took his wife like , what , a minute to cut it off ?
she must have been really mad .
ugh . you know , how do you get that mad ?
not long after i discovered
my ex @-@ husband had been e @-@ mailing another woman ,
we met for breakfast .
that was a big breakfast --
stacks of pancakes , eggs , and all kinds of fancy jams
he thought would somehow make it okay
that he was e @-@ mailing another woman
while he was married to me .
i remember staring at the butter knife
i used to spread my fancy jam ,
and for half a second ,
imagined what the side of his neck might look like
with the butter knife in it .
fancy jams dripping down
the side of his fat , e @-@ mail , cheating neck .
yep , i &apos;ve been that mad .
i thought derek was cheating on me , and i got that mad .
&quot; two trauma surgeons and an orthopod &quot; kind of mad .
hmm . no comment .
you know , cutting off a penis
isn &apos;t actually that big of a deal .
i mean , it &apos;s not like he needs it for survival
or to think or , like , i don &apos;t know , to walk .
what ?
hey , it &apos;s my leg .
and , you know -- and for the record ,
i only thought - about maiming you once , callie ,
and i told you that the second i thought it .
thank you ?
look , the difference is , we may think about it ,
but we don &apos;t actually dismember our spouses .
no
it &apos;s good to know .
dr. torres , dr. shepherd needs you in the o.r. as soon as possible .
it &apos;s for marissa .
we can &apos;t get spinal alignment .
oh , damn it .
whoa . what &apos;s happening ?
spinal cord function is completely gone .
we need to decompress .
warren said that you couldn &apos;t get the spinal alignment .
after he left , the rod slipped .
the l5 joint was more unstable than anticipated .
she &apos;s gonna be paralyzed .
unless we get in there now .
all right , prep the table . we need to flip her over .
what ?
the only way we can stabilize her
is with an anterior approach .
i need to get to her spine through her abdomen .
okay , i need to close .
no , no , no . - we don &apos;t have time for that .
just shove a bacitracin sponge in there .
move that c @-@ arm .
over here .
all right , i need to get in there now
if she &apos;s gonna walk again .
we can &apos;t just turn her over .
one wrong move , we could sever the spinal cord completely .
we don &apos;t have a choice . we have to move fast .
let &apos;s get ready to log @-@ roll her .
all right , everybody get into place .
watch those i.v. lines .
we need sterile towels .
okay , i &apos;m gonna pull the frame .
warren , you catch her , okay ?
on it .
all right . on my count .
one , two , three .
the annulus is completely disrupted .
i need a visual confirmation the nerves are free .
warren , i need more retraction
on the aorta and the vena cava . - no , wait -- not yet .
warren , i need you to set up an intraoperative myelogram .
uh , we can &apos;t wait for that .
the spine &apos;s too unstable .
warren , i need an interbody spacer .
if the nerves are trapped when you apply the spacer ,
she will be paralyzed permanently .
warren , i need you to -- - o @-@ okay , stop . stop .
all due respect , but i can &apos;t set up a myelogram ,
retract vessels , and get a spacer simultaneously .
now , i used to be an anesthesiologist .
i have logged i don &apos;t know how many hours in the o.r.
and believe me , this is not the first time that i &apos;ve seen
two brilliant surgeons duke it out over a body .
i am not getting in the middle of that .
so , i &apos;m gonna stand here ,
and i will happily proceed as you both see fit ,
but you are gonna have to agree on what to do first .
explain to me quickly why you think we need to do a myelogram .
it &apos;s the only way to know for sure
if any of the nerve roots are trapped
before we realign the spine .
okay , so i could start removing the disc
while you do an ultrasound ?
yes , and then you could reduce the spine and hold it in place
while i check the image .
fine . let &apos;s try it . warren .
get the ultrasound probe draped .
right away .
and remind me to put warren on scut when we &apos;re out of here .
will do .
mm @-@ hmm .
can you do me a favor , dear ,
and just retract that a bit further ?
thank you .
could you do me a favor ?
if dr. webber asks ,
maybe could you tell him that the patient requested you
so i sort of had to call --
april , i &apos;m not gonna lie .
you made the right call .
he &apos;s just gonna have to deal with it .
edwards , join us at the field , please .
what year are you ?
third , dr. avery .
okay , have you ever done a phalloplasty before ?
no . not yet .
well , it &apos;s high time you learned .
first , you take a saphenous vein graft ,
like this .
mm @-@ hmm .
and you attach it to the neophallus .
this will provide the new penis with a profuse blood flow .
now -- you .
okay , first anchor the stitch .
good . now run the suture .
good .
you might be aware , edwards ,
there &apos;s a shortage of women in the urology field .
but there &apos;s no shortage of female patients who might prefer
a physician that has a more personal understanding of the anatomy .
okay , edwards . that was ...
above average .
oh .
you do understand that
that &apos;s just about the highest compliment i give ?
ever .
surgery went well ?
what do you think ?
why do i even ask ?
my work was impeccable . it &apos;s all up to him now .
how do you mean ?
when one suffers an injury to his manhood ,
recovery is always challenging --
sometimes hopeless .
you all hold on to so much
of your fragile , little self @-@ esteem down there .
it &apos;s possible you may never bounce back .
mm , sad , really .
the defect in your daughter &apos;s spine was ...
more extensive than we thought .
but we were able to realign her spine ,
and with therapy ,
she should be able to walk again , even run .
so she &apos;ll never play golf again ?
but she &apos;ll be alive .
she will be ... mobile .
i wish that were enough , but it &apos;s not .
this is all she wants .
the only thing .
and i &apos;m the unsupportive mom
who hired the crappy doctors
sho couldn &apos;t deliver the one thing she wanted
more than anything else in this world .
i &apos;m so sorry . i ... will talk to her .
my daughter ...
was excellent .
you were supposed to be , too .
excuse me .
hey .
amelia ...
we did everything we could . come on .
we should have done it your way from the beginning .
we should have started there .
she would be better off .
that is not true . her defect --
my approach made things worse .
no , it didn &apos;t .
amelia .
there you are . how did the surgery go ?
i can &apos;t do this .
you okay ?
no . no , i am not .
you shouldn &apos;t have weighed in .
i wish you hadn &apos;t .
excuse me ?
you should have stayed out of it .
my approach was inferior .
and it cost my patient in ...
terrible ways .
what are you talking about ?
can you tell me honestly
that you siding with me today was only about that patient ?
it had nothing to do with you and me ?
your plan was smart and solid
and more in line with what the patient wanted .
but why were you there ? - that is why i suggested --
why -- the only reason you even walked into that room
was because you heard my voice and you wanted to check on me
and see me because of your personal feelings .
i know , because i would have done the same thing .
because we can &apos;t help it . we are hard @-@ wired .
our brains change when we ...
when we fall for another person ,
our neurological pathways get altered ,
and we make choices .
we make decisions , whether we want to or not .
this -- this is why it is not smart
to mix personal and professional .
amelia , that is not what happened .
i left my home .
i left my job .
i have been trying so hard to start over .
i have been fighting so hard just to be taken seriously ,
to do this job well .
that mom thinks that i am a crappy doctor
who screwed her kid out of a future ,
and she is not wrong ,
because all of this could have been avoided
if i had just ...
... if we had just kept our professional lives professional ,
but we didn &apos;t .
it was a mistake .
this is a mistake .
he &apos;s full of crap . let it go .
all right , look , when you get going , you can talk -- a lot .
but it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not like you talk too much .
say something .
it was humiliating .
why ? because you have more to say than him ?
look , he &apos;s -- he &apos;s probably intimidated
&apos;cause you &apos;re smarter than he is and -- and funnier .
y @-@ you &apos;re funny as hell .
you make me laugh every time we hang out .
you &apos;ve got that lispy thing and ...
l @-@ look , y @-@ you &apos;re never gonna meet
a guy who doesn &apos;t like that lispy thing .
they &apos;ll never tell you to your face ,
but it makes everything you say sound good .
it &apos;s , like , cute and sexy and ...
oh , that -- that -- that smile
and that -- that hair and , you know ...
look , there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
this is not your problem . it &apos;s his problem .
you talk , yeah , but he should want to listen .
anyway , something &apos;s wrong with the dude .
tell him to piss off .
mayos .
there is still slight edema ,
but that should resolve with time .
the phallus is pink , not blue or gray .
that indicates good blood flow .
which means that things are progressing
much better than expected .
and you are a lucky man .
is it ... gonna work ?
i &apos;m optimistic that you &apos;ll get back most of your normal function .
baby ?
marcia .
wife .
quietly , carefully , slip out of this room .
call security right now .
i &apos;ve been so worried about you .
ma &apos;am , i don &apos;t know how you located this room ,
but i &apos;m gonna need you to wait outside .
no .
i called her .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetheart .
i never should have ...
it &apos;s my fault . we had an agreement .
waitresses and hostesses were okay -- nothing else .
she &apos;s your sous @-@ chef .
i know . i know . it &apos;s not okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , baby , i &apos;m sorry .
sweetie .
i don &apos;t get it . how is he kissing her ?
how &apos;s he kissing the woman who --
sometimes , it takes crazy to love crazy .
i can &apos;t explain it .
is security on their way ?
oh , yeah . be here any minute .
kepner !
dr. webber .
i &apos;ve been teaching here for a very long time .
i present salient points with clarity and authority ,
which is why i am very interested in understanding
why the hell you called catherine avery
when i explicitly told you not to !
all right . i &apos;ll tell you .
my patient today had a terrible injury .
the very best person to treat that injury was catherine avery .
now , i don &apos;t know what personal stuff is going on
between the two of you exactly , but whatever it is ,
i will not allow it to compromise
my patient , his care , or his penis !
and for what it &apos;s worth ,
i think you two are good together !
also , catherine avery is my mother @-@ in @-@ law ,
so i &apos;ll call her any damn time i feel like it !
understood .
all right .
need something ?
&apos;cause i was just headed out for the night .
yeah , i -- i brought the thunder .
sorry ?
i brought the thunder . it &apos;s what i call it .
only -- i mean , - it &apos;s very effective at work .
it &apos;s totally inappropriate on a date .
i was nervous .
i didn &apos;t socialize a lot as a kid .
i kind of spent all my time in books ,
and you don &apos;t have to socialize ...
... with books .
so when i get nervous ,
i tend to cover it up by talking a lot
and being really loud and definite
and being in charge ...
so no one will see how scared i am .
and on our date , i was terrified because ...
you &apos;re very handsome and nice ,
and you &apos;re great .
and i &apos;m dorky . i &apos;m nerdy . i &apos;m me .
so i brought the thunder ,
and i &apos;m so , so sorry ,
because i really liked you .
i just -- i just wanted you to know that i @-@ i wasn &apos;t ...
i mean , i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m ...
anyway ...
bye .
maggie .
next time , i &apos;ll bring the thunder .
look , i appreciate that you are looking out for owen .
i do , but what i do and who i see are ,
quite honestly , none of your business .
okay .
i was only trying to --
i moved here to start something ,
to build a new life .
you don &apos;t know me ...
not really .
you don &apos;t know where i &apos;ve been
or what i &apos;ve had to overcome ,
because you have never had to .
you &apos;ve never lost the love of your life .
you have never cried
over the body of the person you love most in this world .
you ...
you don &apos;t know how that messes a person up .
you &apos;ve never had to claw your way back from that .
but i have .
i &apos;m still trying to pull myself together ,
and i am doing the very best that i can , so ...
until you &apos;ve done that , until you have to walk in my shoes .
i need you to cut me some slack ...
and back the hell off .
the microvascular work is amazing .
i mean , every tiny , little incision has to be perfect .
oh , did i tell you
catherine avery told me i was above average ?
yeah , yeah . you mentioned it .
this might be it . i might have found my specialty .
thank god !
i &apos;ve been worried about your specialty all day !
shut up .
what happened in there ?
oh , she cut it off ! she cut it off !
what ? ! your wife ? !
it was my sous @-@ chef ! oh , god !
come back with that penis !
come back with that penis !
okay . hold it right there .
okay , rory . hand it over .
no .
don &apos;t be scared , all right ?
give me the penis , and everything will be fine .
stop .
don &apos;t come any closer .
just put it in my hand --
i said stop .
i swear to god , you come any closer , i &apos;ll flush it .
okay .
okay , everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
no one wants to hurt you .
all you have to do is just give it to me ,
and everything will be fine .
i was more than his sous @-@ chef .
he said i was his heart , his muse .
we were gonna open another restaurant --
our restaurant , together , as co @-@ chefs .
he was gonna leave marcia .
i believed him .
i believed in him .
but then ...
she cut off his penis , and he still took her back .
that &apos;s not fair .
no , that &apos;s not fair .
all you wanted to do was be together .
i don &apos;t understand .
come on .
you are a woman of rare talent --
a forward thinker , a warrior .
you saw my masterpiece in the hands of a thief ,
and you ran to its rescue .
you charged into battle .
thank you .
you &apos;re exactly the kind of surgeon that i need in boston --
bold , fearless .
and when you &apos;re looking at specialties ,
i hope that you will consider a urology fellowship with me .
that -- that &apos;s -- wow .
you deserve it , edwards .
without you , this man &apos;s specimen
would have turned into a sad , old bagpipe .
so , you finish up here ,
and i &apos;ll go check on our patient in pre @-@ op .
do you need something ?
i need to make one thing clear .
my manhood has not been damaged here .
you may think i have a problem with powerful women , but --
you &apos;re having one right now .
no . right now , - i am having a problem with you .
we are having this problem .
and the problem is , i hurt you .
i hurt your feelings , and i &apos;m sorry .
i came to you last year intending to propose ,
but i let our professional differences stop me .
we love our work .
it &apos;s everything to us ,
so it &apos;s easy to prioritize it .
i made that mistake before . i don &apos;t want to make it again .
let me stop you right there ,
because i don &apos;t think i can do this .
i ...
it &apos;s just happened too many damn times --
with jackson &apos;s father , with you .
you work -- you work to make something better ,
and then it just all -- it just falls apart every time .
i know . it &apos;s true .
in fact , the only thing i can truly promise
is i &apos;ll probably hurt you again .
well , that &apos;s really enticing .
oh , and you &apos;ll hurt me ,
and i &apos;ll come right back to you again when you do .
i &apos;ll accept the risk
because you are worth it ,
because you matter to me .
because i love you .
and i &apos;m not going anywhere .
you okay ?
what do you think ?
i think there are probably a hundred things
that you &apos;d be great at that you haven &apos;t even tried yet .
my mom thinks i did all this
because i get some kind of weird high
off being better than everyone else .
and don &apos;t get me wrong .
being excellent is ...
amazing .
but that &apos;s because i love this .
loved this .
even if you &apos;re both right ,
that i &apos;ll find something else ,
i &apos;ll never really love it --
not like this .
maybe not , but i believe
we get more than just one thing to love .
and one day ...
... something will click .
and you &apos;ll know you found it .
i have to believe that .
so , hang on . h @-@ h @-@ hang on .
so , you just chased after her
as she ran down the hall with his penis ?
tell me again about the gloves .
how on earth did you think to grab gloves ?
instinct , i guess .
so , uh , when do you leave for boston ?
i don &apos;t know . can -- let &apos;s not talk about it .
i can &apos;t believe she handed the penis over to you --
just like that .
so lucky .
yeah , she did . she handed it to me .
severed penis .
i was standing there
holding a severed penis in my hand ,
and all i could think was ,
&quot; this isn &apos;t why i became a surgeon . &quot;
i do not love this penis .
i do not want a career in urology .
i mean , i don &apos;t know what i do want ,
but i know i don &apos;t want that ,
&apos;cause that thing was gross .
hey , are you hungry ?
i hear it &apos;s tots day in the cafeteria .
the thing about love is ,
when it &apos;s good , it &apos;s so very good .
what ?
nothing .
let &apos;s get some tots .
okay .
and when it &apos;s bad , it hurts so much .
hey , can we talk ?
uh , actually , i was just --
what &apos;s really going on ?
i need you to tell me , &apos; cause ...
... you say one thing ,
and i think you mean something else entirely ,
and i want to understand .
i am trying to .
because i want what we started here .
i do .
but i need a little help .
i don &apos;t think
that this is really the place that we should be talking --
dr. shepherd ? you have a call on line 4 .
i got to get that .
and if you can &apos;t find a way
to balance all those ups and downs ...
it will make you crazy .
hello ?
oh , no , sorry . you want the other dr. shepherd .
here &apos;s his wife .
hi . this is dr. shepherd &apos;s wife .
uh , no , he &apos;s not here . can i take a message for you ?
okay , sure .
oh . i thought he was there .
okay . sure . no problem .
okay , thank you .
bye @-@ bye .
well , that was weird .
what was ?
nothing .
just that was the white house calling .
derek never showed up at his meeting this morning .
oh , yeah ?
i &apos;m sure his flight got delayed or something .
