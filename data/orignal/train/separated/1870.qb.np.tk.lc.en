surgeons can &apos;t be lazy .
the risks are too great .
that one looks like an islet cell .
which one ?
that one . it &apos;s all puffy and insulin producing .
it looks like a cloud .
it looks like an islet cell or maybe a buffalo .
the second we stop pushing ourselves ,
something terrible happens ,
something we never see coming .
i have no imagination , mer .
teddy sucked it out of me .
oh , let &apos;s not go there .
we &apos;re just gonna believe that everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
we &apos;re keeping the faith .
yeah .
she did say that she had something great for me today .
what are you on ?
cabbage patch .
o.b. still ? you gotta get out of those pink scrubs .
why ? bailey &apos;s got me blackballed from every surgery .
besides , it &apos;s quiet .
i get to work on the trial stuff .
i thought bailey told you to stay away from the trial stuff .
i know , but i just can &apos;t help it
because i feel like i &apos;m this close to--
hey !
that coulda hit us .
careful .
nice hustle .
you know , i think this is just
more avoiding thinking about zola .
did you hear something ?
no . i--we &apos;ve bugged janet till she &apos;s sick of us ,
and she doesn &apos;t really know anything ,
so we just have to wait for the court to give us
a hearing date , and we &apos;re just ...
keeping the faith .
keeping the faith .
karev , throw the ball !
okay , okay , okay , okay .
aah ! come on !
robbins , don &apos;t be afraid of it .
wait . i--oh ! well , it flew at my head .
not bad . not bad .
you like that ?
i said not bad .
don &apos;t go crazy .
sloan .
hey , sloan .
yo !
focus . hello ?
okay .
who is that ?
oh , julia canner or kinney .
she &apos;s an ophthalmologist from seattle pres .
mark &apos;s been ... seeing her .
every night this week .
all right , nice throw , robbins . that &apos;s the way .
hey , webber , why don &apos;t you come down here
and show us how it &apos;s done ?
uh , let me finish the chapter .
i need my energy for the game .
in my experience , we &apos;ll need it .
mm @-@ hmm .
who &apos;s up ?
hey , hunt .
all right , come on in .
when are you gonna let me pitch ?
i &apos;m a really good pitcher .
uh , we &apos;re fine .
shepherd throws an unbeatable screwball , all right ?
now ... little grey ,
let &apos;s go .
go , lexie !
drop the bat . go , go .
run to third . don &apos;t stop . all right .
come on , everyone . look alive .
yang , grey , you--you could at least stand up .
hi , honey .
looking good , chief hunt .
hi , chief macdougall .
make it brad .
i &apos;m surprised to see you out here , hunt .
we &apos;ve had this field every morning .
is this your first practice ?
uh , no . no , no . we &apos;ve been ...
oh . i would &apos;ve thought it was .
kudos for putting a team together at all this year ,
what with all the upheaval over at seattle grace .
yeah , well , we &apos;ve got a lot of good players--
webber being ousted , all that nasty business
with the alzheimer &apos;s trial being shut down--
no wonder they put a trauma guy in charge .
you must feel like you &apos;re just scrambling
to stop the hemorrhaging over there .
we got another half @-@ hour out here or so ,
and then we &apos;re gonna be ready to kick your asses tomorrow .
oh , just a half @-@ hour ?
is that all you need ?
hunt , i gotta go .
what ?
lexie .
yeah .
we got a consult .
okay .
no . no , wait . we &apos;re--
i gotta check on a sick kid .
can i get a ride ?
listen , no--
i gotta update the boards .
no , no .
is that it ?
no , we &apos;re still--
are we done ?
just--just wait ...
hustle .
everyone . no , no .
whoa . looks like your half @-@ hour &apos;s up .
wait .
all right , guys .
come on . let &apos;s do it .
all right .
got it ?
i got third . i got third .
you said &quot; great . &quot;
is it a transplant ?
oh , is it a heterotopic transplant ?
no .
but you said &quot; great . &quot; is it--is it big ?
well , it &apos;ll probably take you all morning .
mr. felker , this is dr. yang .
and she will be performing your angioplasty .
nice to meet you .
any first year can do this .
i thought i was gonna be working on a heart .
you &apos;re gonna be working on
preventing mr. felker from having a heart attack .
i mean , i thought i was gonna be working on a heart
in the o.r.
hey .
is someone gonna roto @-@ rooter my veins out ?
mm @-@ hmm .
so i typed it up for you .
uh , fielding positions , batting order--
it &apos;s all right here .
you &apos;re a good administrative assistant .
thank you , sir .
that &apos;s not a compliment .
i think being chief resident has set you back .
i &apos;d like to see you getting off the sidelines more .
one , two , three .
okay , what do we have ?
carl shatler , sanitation worker , mid 30 &apos;s .
fell off the back of a garbage truck ,
then hit by a car backing out of a driveway .
okay , vitals are stable but he has multiple contusions ,
scalp lac , and obvious hand injuries .
okay , carl ? carl , i &apos;m dr. hunt .
do you know where you are ?
can you hear me ?
g.c.s. 10 , and pupils are equal and reactive .
i &apos;m gonna need the portable x @-@ ray and ultrasound .
right away .
oh , this hand &apos;s hamburger .
he &apos;s gonna lose some of this .
oh , god . no !
calm down .
no !
calm down . kepner , where is that ultrasound ?
give us some room here , torres .
okay , i just need to stabilize the hand ,
and then i will--
i said , give us some room .
the hand is not the priority right now .
fine . page me when you need me .
mm @-@ hmm .
hey , karev , i need you to sign these .
what is it ?
a @-@ a subpoena for zola &apos;s medical records .
they &apos;re transferring her care to seattle pres .
wait . why ? we &apos;re her doctors .
well , it &apos;s a conflict of interest
because her prospective parents work here .
that &apos;s genius .
first they take her away from shepherd and grey ,
now they want to take her away from her doctors ?
wait , wait , the file .
you have to sign--
don &apos;t worry . i got this .
let &apos;s see . the patient just flew in from san francisco .
she has a hypothalamic hamartoma .
what do you know ?
h.h. tumors are slow @-@ growing , noncancerous .
they sit in the hypothalamus--
mrs. bayer , can i help you ?
no , it &apos;s best if i just hold her .
it &apos;s okay , sweetheart .
how long has she been seizing ?
well , this is the fourth one today .
it &apos;s getting worse ,
so please tell me you can help her .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s tricky .
charissa &apos;s tumor is eccentric .
it off to one side more than the other .
protocol is a subfrontal approach
from here , but i &apos;d never get it all .
well , the surgeon in san francisco said
that even if you just got a little bit of it ,
the symptoms wouldn &apos;t be as bad .
for now , um , until it grows back .
well , we &apos;ll take any relief that we can get .
i know the risks , and i &apos;ve done my research .
and you ...
you were successful on 87 % of your surgeries last year .
so we want the surgery and we want you to do it .
i &apos;d like to try something else .
excuse me ?
i &apos;d like to come in from here ,
from above .
i think i &apos;d have a much better visualization
and i think i could get it all .
but none of the eight other neurosurgeons
we talked to even suggested that .
well , that &apos;s because it &apos;s never been done before .
well , what are the risks ?
uh , well , you &apos;re passing between two hemispheres ,
so there &apos;s a greater risk of injury ,
including short @-@ term memory loss ,
um , stroke , and even death .
no .
i can &apos;t do that .
i understand . i really do .
a subfrontal approach is a very standard procedure .
you could probably find another surgeon
who &apos;s qualified to do that .
can i see the list of who you talked to ?
uh ... yes , but ...
i &apos;d rather have you .
dr. samuelson is fantastic .
i don &apos;t think you could do better than him .
it was very nice meeting you , ms. bayer ,
and i wish you the best of luck .
so why did i just have an irate mother
claim that you refuse to save the life
of her teenage daughter ?
it was a consult for an h.h. tumor .
i told her that with a transcallosal approach ,
i think i could get it all .
she didn &apos;t want to take the risk .
it &apos;s a free country .
so do it the old @-@ fashioned way .
there are plenty of surgeons in san francisco
as qualified as i am to do that .
but they want you . they got on a plane .
i won &apos;t do it . it will grow back .
maybe it won &apos;t .
maybe .
maybe we should just wait and see and hope for the best .
yes .
no . i &apos;m not gonna do that anymore .
i had a kid in a crib in my bedroom for a while ,
and social services took her away .
and the only thing they &apos;re gonna say to me now
is that you gotta wait and see
and hope for the best .
it &apos;s frustrating . i get that .
i am sick of half measures .
not in my or .
not today . i can &apos;t .
i think you can .
i think her best shot is in your hands ,
and so does that mother .
we don &apos;t send people home , derek .
it &apos;s not who we are . it &apos;s not who you are .
you &apos;re right .
don &apos;t send her back .
so then you &apos;ll do it ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna prove to her my way will work .
so basically what you &apos;re saying is ,
the device that you put in him is defective .
i &apos;m saying ,
you--you got one of the original devices ,
and there are some kinks to work out .
so it &apos;s a collectible .
when i die , you should just put it on ebay .
for now , the only issue is that you have to resume daily testing--
because he could become diabetic again .
is that right ?
because the device is basically a huge failure .
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s got some problems .
which she is trying to fix .
that &apos;s why they call it a trial .
hey , the good news is ,
we figured out what was wrong .
and we &apos;re trying hard to figure out how to fix it .
look , i @-@ i knew the risks
when they put this tiddlywink in me .
plus , all the checkups mean i get to see you more .
don &apos;t worry .
you &apos;ll figure it out .
okay , mr. felker . i &apos;m going to insert the catheter now .
i &apos;ll guide it up to the arteries surrounding your heart .
get ready to see a lot of cheeseburgers and fries .
i work in fast food .
so is this all you do every day ,
suck crap out of clogged veins ?
arteries . they &apos;re called arteries .
i &apos;m more of a renaissance @-@ type guy .
i &apos;m a manager ,
but i have to know how to work the fry machine ,
man the grill , make shakes .
hell , when everyone else is busy ,
i &apos;m even the guy who mops out the john .
okay , we &apos;re giving you a little more sedation now .
i guess everyone else is busy , huh ?
they gave you john duty .
wow . someone looks like they got--
they got worse news than us .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i &apos;m cheered up already .
i may have just lost my pitcher to a brain surgery .
but--but i &apos;m telling you , i @-@ i can pitch .
honey , you were a pro ballplayer .
come on . tell him . tell him .
tell him i can pitch .
i &apos;ve never seen her pitch .
you &apos;re a pro ballplayer ?
well , former . i &apos;m a pro shipping clerk now .
can you play tomorrow ?
doesn &apos;t he have to work here ?
i @-@ i @-@ i will hire you now and fire you after the game .
you are now my administrative assistant .
can &apos;t i be something cool ,
like a vascular surgeon or--
you can be whatever you want
if you help us beat seattle pres .
i can help you beat seattle pres .
i &apos;m telling you , i can pitch .
hey , grey , i was just in giving the tyson family
an update on their preemie ,
and the mom &apos;s complaining of chest pains .
already called altman for a consult .
okay , great .
uh , did you--have you talked to karev ?
about ?
well--well , the court asked for zola &apos;s medical records .
why ?
well , it &apos;s pro-- it &apos;s probably nothing .
i mean , don &apos;t read anything into it .
i just-- i thought you should know .
thanks .
interactive properties of islet cells ?
is--is that bailey &apos;s thing ?
i &apos;m working with bailey on this .
i thought bailey was pissed at you .
no . no , we &apos;re good .
okay . good , then .
next in line .
hey . um , i &apos;m trying to get some information
about this adoption case .
the name is zola--
family services .
what ?
requests for information
can be made in writing to family services .
uh , look , i &apos;m her doctor .
and , uh , they subpoenaed her medical records--
i can &apos;t take your files .
look , i &apos;m not asking you to .
i &apos;m just--i just want to talk to someone about this adoption .
it takes six to eight weeks to process requests .
never mind .
next .
where do i write ? what &apos;s the address ?
this address .
office of family court services , fifth floor .
fifth floor . thanks .
uh , so ct &apos;s negative for internal bleeding .
so chief hunt says mr. shatler &apos;s all yours .
oh , that &apos;s super .
hey , tell chief hunt i &apos;m so grateful
he gave me the go @-@ ahead .
okay . w-- was that sarcastic ?
sorry .
um , hey , is there any chance
you need an assist on that hand ?
i need more or time .
sure . go schedule an or .
oh , and , uh , wish me luck .
i &apos;m about to tell a guy
his crappy day just got crappier .
considering all you went through ,
you were lucky , really .
that sounds like a setup for bad news .
some of the bones in your hand were pulverized .
oh . there was extensive nerve and tissue damage .
i &apos;ll know more once we get in the or. and clean it up ,
but there &apos;s a chance you could lose these two fingers .
look , i know it &apos;s a shock ...
damn it .
but you survived a terrible accident--
son of a--
whoa . holy crap . what are you--
uh , wh @-@ what are you doing ?
oh , no , no , that &apos;s not a weapon .
um-- that--that &apos;s a--
a spitsticker .
i @-@ i do--
i do woodcarving , um , wood prints .
i , uh , i carry this stuff with me
&apos;cause i have a lot of downtime on my job .
i ...
okay .
um , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just , you kinda ...
yeah . and that scared the hell outta me .
i was just looking for my phone to--to call my wife .
okay .
are you gonna freak out if i stick my hand in here again ?
no .
wow . this ...
this is gorgeous .
can i ...
yeah .
do you ...
do you sell this stuff ?
no , no .
collecting garbage pays the bills .
this--
this--this keeps me sane .
or it did ...
till today .
you might want to leave the room .
she &apos;s gonna be pretty upset .
make sure you , uh , tell her that i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m something of an artist myself .
how about now ? any lights ?
yeah . supplemental motor area .
great . i just paralyzed the whole left side .
so she &apos;s completely paralyzed .
we hit the right side earlier .
all right .
let &apos;s try another angle .
damn . what was that ?
fornix . ooh , through to the basilar .
so she &apos;d be , uh ...
mute , memory loss , brain dead .
how &apos;s it going ?
i just can &apos;t find a clean approach .
lexie , shut down the monitor .
i guess i owe the mom a surgery .
no , no , no . no , not yet .
not yet . try it again .
all right , now you &apos;re really getting on my nerves .
i &apos;m just practicing my coaching skills .
seriously , shepherd . pick up the damn probe .
all right .
turn it back on .
oh . hey .
teddy gave me a marathon angioplasty .
her &quot; great &quot; thing was a plumbing job .
they &apos;ve subpoenaed zola &apos;s medical records .
well , that ...
that &apos;s good . it &apos;s movement .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna e @-@ mail janet and see if she knows anything .
we &apos;re keeping the faith , right ?
did i mention , i can &apos;t crack this islet cell thing either ?
i &apos;ve been researching responses all day to an insulin challenge ,
and just nothing .
see that , that right there ?
that used to be a curly fry .
and i used to be a surgeon .
janet .
you &apos;re right . you keep the faith .
&quot; dear client , i will be out of the office all week . &quot;
i &apos;ve been picturing her making calls ,
fighting the good fight to get me my kid back ,
not sitting on a beach somewhere .
i know . mer .
zola &apos;s probably forgotten us by now .
uh , hey . uh ...
excuse me .
um , i &apos;m trying to get some information
about an adoption case .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll make a wonderful father ,
but until the judge rules a case closed , i ca ...
oh , i &apos;m not the dad . i &apos;m the doctor .
the kid &apos;s sick and ...
sweetheart , i &apos;ve heard every sad story in the book .
it doesn &apos;t change the fact that we don &apos;t release information
on pending cases .
you know , i , uh ...
i couldn &apos;t help but notice the dysplastic nevus ...
the mole .
what ?
yeah , anyone ever check that for you ?
yes , but ...
they said it &apos;s not dangerous .
not now anyway .
me ? i wouldn &apos;t take that chance .
oh , right . crappy government insurance .
that would be on the deductible .
hey , look , i &apos;m a surgeon .
you give me the stats on this kid ,
i &apos;ll take care of you for free .
yeah , she &apos;s on judge brentner &apos;s docket .
let &apos;s see if , uh ...
oh , wait . he &apos;s not even here today .
he &apos;s getting chemo .
so sad . prostate .
hey , you &apos;re a doctor . is that one of the bad ones ?
mm , not necessarily .
depends on where he &apos;s getting it treated .
it could be postpartum cardiomyopathy .
i &apos;ll transfer her to telemetry .
okay .
hey , dr. altman .
why is cristina doing an angioplasty ?
excuse me ?
i was just wondering , and i know she was , too .
is ... is this all going somewhere ?
i mean , i know it &apos;s none of my business , but ...
you &apos;re right .
as a first year ,
you do an angio to learn a technical skill ,
but an angio as a fifth year is about learning respect .
respect for the heart disease
that cristina will see for the rest of her career .
it all starts there , in the artery .
you have to go back to the beginning
to understand the end .
back to the beginning .
all right , so move avery to shortstop
and put bailey in center field .
bailey ? why bailey ?
well , because bailey &apos;s a leader .
she &apos;ll know who to get the ball to .
she &apos;s not your cutoff man . avery , he &apos;s your cutoff man .
she &apos;s tall . where do you have her ?
uh ... left field .
can she catch ?
uh , let &apos;s find out .
grey , catch .
hunt , what the hell ?
now he &apos;s your cutoff man .
yeah .
i &apos;ve been looking for you .
i need my mother &apos;s journals .
why ? what &apos;s up ?
well , i need to see her original hypothesis .
if i &apos;m gonna figure out what &apos;s going on ,
then i need to start where she started .
i knew once you picked it up , you couldn &apos;t put it down .
don &apos;t gloat . where are they ?
come on .
nice .
the patient and her mother are wondering
if she &apos;s having surgery today .
should i tell them that you are still working ?
we are working .
sometimes the body thinks better than the brain .
grey , toss him a ball .
hello . yeah . yeah .
i thought the board meeting would be pushed to thursday .
oh , your swing &apos;s too high .
did you play ball ?
yeah . i was a pitcher .
really ?
yeah .
right , into the parking ...
mark &apos;s in love .
oh , with an eye doctor .
that should last 48 hours .
yeah , well , i should be happy for him .
don &apos;t worry about .
just shake it off or shake it out
or i don &apos;t know , shake something .
it &apos;s his new coaching persona .
i &apos;m still work on it .
you are still coming out of wrong .
you are pounching the ball wrong .
i &apos;m holding the bat wrong ?
no , no . not the bat . it &apos;s your body .
you need to adjust your head .
drop your shoulder .
you are not connecting .
the head is in the wrong angle .
i need to adjust it properly .
you need to adjust the angle of the head .
i went back to the lab to test my approach .
there &apos;s a very good shot
i can access the tumor from above .
i think we can get it all .
a good shot ?
this is my child .
well , there are risks either way ,
uh , but this certainly has more risks .
so she could die in surgery .
look , thank you for trying , dr. shepherd , but i ...
i can &apos;t let my little girl be your guinea pig .
mrs. bayer ,
now in all your research ,
have you ever found a story of a kid with an h.h. tumor ,
whoever got better ...
whoever got a job ,
had a life ?
this is the best shot you &apos;ll have .
altman . sloan , you &apos;re on first .
oh , bailey , you &apos;re center field .
we &apos;re doing some shuffling .
what are you doing here ?
i work here .
uh , i may not even make the game .
i got 49 trial patients left to call .
i gotta give them the same bad news i gave you .
ouch . that &apos;s rough .
we need a sub for center field .
yeah . uh , shepherd , pitcher .
shepherd &apos;s out .
he told me his brain surgery could be a marathon .
oh ! me . let me pitch .
okay .
all right , altman , pitcher .
yes .
sloan , first .
shepherd can be a pinch hitter .
okay , torres , you &apos;re on ...
i need you to sign for this .
bone plates and titanium mesh ? that &apos;s a lot of hardware .
i thought you said this guy &apos;s hand wasn &apos;t salvageable .
yeah , well , i &apos;m gonna try and rebuild it .
it &apos;s gonna be really cool . april , meet me in the o.r.
i need a small .
oh , they &apos;re all larges .
what ?
no . we can &apos;t be out of smalls already .
i told them we needed an assortment of sizes .
i ... i was very clear on the phone .
sweet .
i &apos;ll look fantastic in this .
and when you look good , you play good .
am i right , avery ?
you know it .
what the hell was that ?
what ?
what , are you guys pledging delta chi together ?
no , sloan &apos;s pretty cool , actually .
he &apos;s , uh , been in such a good mood lately ,
he &apos;s letting me do half his procedures .
he let me run the burn center last night .
neat .
okay , grey , you &apos;re , uh ...
winning is an attitude .
we &apos;re winners .
yeah .
okay , so this
will hold his hand in place
so i can see the tendon and nerve gaps , and ...
what the chief doesn &apos;t realize is that a lot of the work i do
makes it possible for these surgeries to take place .
i mean , all the ...
all the staffing and scheduling , i ...
i mean , so maybe ...
okay , maybe i &apos;m not in the o.r. all the time ...
april .
but i ...
do you want to be an administrative assistant ?
is that what makes your heart sing ?
no , of course not .
then stop being a whiner .
stop hiding behind paperwork .
if you love it , do it . just get in the o.r.
okay ? don &apos;t sleep , don &apos;t eat .
just do this .
here .
you want me to place the k @-@ wire ?
will it make your heart sing ?
yes . yeah , right .
okay , placing the wire .
okay . oh , you &apos;re a little too far to the left .
okay , i got it . sorry .
there you go . right there . good . that &apos;s all right .
i didn &apos;t do anything . i swear .
damn it .
no , just stop . what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know , but his pressure &apos;s tanking .
i &apos;m hanging blood .
it looks like electrical alternans .
he &apos;s tamponading .
what the hell ? page cardio .
these things i need done . is that okay ?
mm @-@ hmm . mm @-@ hmm .
thank you . thank you .
sorry .
what is that ?
uh , my mom &apos;s journal .
no , i know what it is . why do you have it ?
because it &apos;s my mom &apos;s journal .
freeze it . intraluminal flap and pericardial effusion .
damn it . he &apos;s got a dissection .
that &apos;s why he fell .
it must have started when he was on the truck .
he probably passed out .
oh , god . uh , we need to get altman .
why ? do we need to go--
yes , we need to open him right now .
um , april , start the thoracotomy .
what ? me ? what-- what are you doing ?
getting gowned and gloved . crack his chest .
but i--i &apos;m assisting .
it &apos;s all right . i got this .
go do your thing .
but i &apos;ve never done an aortic dissection .
april , crack his chest now .
um , 10 @-@ blade .
here you go , doctor .
thank you .
okay , here &apos;s the tear .
okay , open the aorta longitudinally .
now transect proximal to the innominate artery .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to do this ?
you &apos;re already there .
all right . what do we have ?
a thoracic aortic dissection .
uh , kepner excised the defect
and he &apos;s going to need a graft .
all right . let me get scrubbed .
you &apos;ll first assist .
torres , can you clear out ?
can you work around me ?
uh , i mean , i &apos;d--i &apos;ll move if i have to , but--
torres , i &apos;m trying to--
i know ,
but trust me , i &apos;m saving his life , too .
can you work around me ?
fine .
yang , why didn &apos;t you just start the graft ?
i didn &apos;t need to . kepner had it .
okay .
i &apos;ve got some of it ,
but i need to change the angle to get the rest of it .
okay , let &apos;s release the mayfield , please .
i need you to hold the probe steady
so i can adjust the angle .
you &apos;re not taking it out ?
it &apos;s too risky .
if we go outside of the track ,
we could hit healthy brain tissue .
come on . take the probe .
hold it still .
move it even 1 millimeter , it &apos;s over .
ready ? let &apos;s give it a whirl .
okay , good . i think ...
the tumor &apos;s dropped into the field .
let &apos;s tighten the device .
okay . good job .
okay , let &apos;s start the aspiration .
very slowly .
go ahead .
heart rate &apos;s 130 . what &apos;s happening ?
the tumor is pulling on the hypothalamus .
push 20 of labetalol , please .
grey , hold the retractor .
let me take this .
heart rate &apos;s 160 .
ah , damn it . i &apos;m pulling out the probe .
but you just said we &apos;re not g--
no , we don &apos;t have a choice .
well , what do we do now ? there &apos;s still tumor left .
we try again .
why didn &apos;t you just start the graft yourself ?
why &apos;d you wait ?
is this a trick question ?
no . i &apos;m asking .
oh , come on .
now i &apos;m in trouble for waiting for you ?
you would &apos;ve ripped me a new one if i did it myself .
two months ago , you would &apos;ve bodychecked kepner
in order to get into this guy &apos;s chest ,
and now you let her just do the surgery ?
and you don &apos;t even like kepner .
this is true .
uh , yes , i could &apos;ve done it myself ,
but she had it .
exactly .
i &apos;m done here .
okay , then could you girls take it outside ?
some of us have a long way to go .
i give up .
i have no idea what you &apos;re trying to do .
i am in trouble if i cut . i &apos;m in trouble if i don &apos;t cut .
i &apos;m a fifth year
who does the work of an intern .
what do you want ?
i want you to make a list .
okay , where , uh , on a blackboard ?
&quot; i will not do any surgeries without a safety helmet . &quot;
i want you to make a list of every surgery
that you have ever dreamed of performing .
shoot for the moon , and i will try to get you some .
because we &apos;re done .
you &apos;ve graduated . this is your present .
you &apos;re messing with me .
all right , you know , at-- at the beginning of this year ,
you nearly killed alex karev in that o.r.
because you just had to get in there ,
you had to be the best , and you had to be first .
but today ...
today i saw a different surgeon--
every bit as good ,
every bit as advanced ,
but you were willing to work on a team .
today ...
you put the patient before yourself .
and that ...
is who i wanted to see .
so ...
you &apos;re done .
make a list .
what ...
what the hell are you doing in here ?
one second .
in a second , i &apos;m @-@ a kick you in your ...
i just need to see if the cell survived .
yes ! yes ! the cell survived .
what are you talking about ?
my mom was wrong . it &apos;s oxygen .
the cells aren &apos;t getting enough oxygen .
she extrapolated the amount delivered
based on tests with mice ,
but the internal structure of an islet cell of a mouse
is completely different than that of a human .
her hypothesis was wrong .
that &apos;s why the islet cells in your device are dying .
i marked the page for you .
you mean it &apos;s gone ? you got it all ?
yes , we won &apos;t know where we are for a couple of days ...
but yeah , i @-@ i did . i @-@ i got it all .
wait . so--so what ?
so--so no more seizures , and she won &apos;t freak out anymore ?
well , she is a teenager , so chances are she might .
yeah , but not because of the tumor .
the fingers ...
they &apos;re all there .
i had to build you a new skeletal framework ,
jerry @-@ rigged some , uh , wire through these bolts here ,
but , um ... yeah , saved your hand .
will it work ?
it should .
there &apos;ll be some follow @-@ up surgery and physical therapy--
a lot of physical therapy--
but you should regain full mobility .
i ...
it &apos;s beautiful .
thank you .
see ?
i told you she was an artist .
uh , mr. brentner ?
yes ?
how am i doing ?
uh , well , uh , someone will--
b @-@ be in to speak with you shortly .
look , i &apos;m sorry to bother you ,
but i need to talk to you about something else .
you have a kid on your docket-- zola .
she &apos;s from africa--
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t discuss a case--
look , just hear me out .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m zola &apos;s doctor .
she &apos;s got spina bifida .
two doctors want to adopt her . they &apos;re just waiting to hear .
but for weeks now ,
she &apos;s been stuck in a foster home .
this is highly inappropriate .
a sick kid like that shouldn &apos;t be with a foster family .
she needs to be in a stable home
with good parents-- these parents .
without that , she &apos;s only gonna get worse .
excuse me . nurse ?
i need--
i &apos;ll be right with you .
don &apos;t bother . i &apos;m leaving , okay ? i &apos;m leaving . just ...
all i &apos;m asking for you to do is to take a look at this case .
that &apos;s it .
please just ... take a look .
doctor .
attempting to influence a judge
is a federal offense .
come on ! knock it out !
come on ! let &apos;s go , shepherd !
yeah !
get it !
all right . all right . all right ,
karev , you &apos;re on second .
let &apos;s get out there and get it back .

he should just call it now .
the new chief &apos;s got something to prove .
hey , hey . you still got your ...
yeah .
aw , yeah .
all right , come on ,
brisman ! you can do it !
come on , dude ! ring it up !
here we go ! here we go !
hit it out of the park ! hit it out of the park ! that &apos;s right !
ah , he &apos;s got it . he &apos;s got it .

keep your eye on it . here we go !
get the walk !
off @-@ pump quintuple cabg .
do you have a pen ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m making a list .
teddy told me to make a bucket list of surgeries .
i kept the faith , mer .
who thought that would pay off ?
here !
it &apos;s not paying off for me .
my faith is currently out of the office .
maybe i cured diabetes , though .
your mom would &apos;ve been proud .
no , she wouldn &apos;t probably not .
oh , god .
here we go .
show &apos; em your stuff .
seriously ? ! really ? !
you want to pitch ?
whoa . hey .
what are you doing out here ?
i &apos;m a roving outfielder . i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m roving .
i &apos;m roving . i &apos;m ...
yes ! yes !
oh , my god ! it &apos;s coming here ! oh !
oh , i got it ! i got it !
get it ! get it ! get it ! i got it !
ball hog !
i had that .
oh , did you ?
or were you gonna let it fall to the ground again ?
what is your problem with me ?
i beg your pardon ?
i don &apos;t want on your stupid trial .
i just need to get it out of my head .
uh , no , mer--
are you drunk ?
she is . we are .
so what is your problem ?
what is my problem ?
all right , i &apos;ll tell you my problem .
my problem is you .
everywhere i look , you &apos;re all in my trial ,
coming in my lab , opening my doors ...
what &apos;s going on out there ?
i &apos;m not sure .
time @-@ out .
i got this , hunt .
c @-@ can he do that ?
he seems to think he can .
oh , this must be pretty humiliating for you .
yeah , you &apos;re gonna look so hot
when you get tagged out at home plate .
oh , in your dreams .
god , get a room .
it &apos;s disgusting .
give the guy a break .
she &apos;s on the opposing team .
so what ? he seems happy .
he &apos;s happy , i &apos;m happy .
and you and me , we &apos;re-- we &apos;re happy , right ?
oh , what is with the friggin &apos; holdup ? let &apos;s play ball !
you are reckless and irresponsible--
but it was between me and the chief and my husband ,
so mind your own damn business ! ah !
you are not the boss of me .
oh , thank god for that . will--
we &apos;re lucky to even be able to have a trial after you--
shut up ! the both of you .
now you ...
you have a lot of nerve ,
rubbing meredith &apos;s nose in her mistakes
when you can &apos;t fix your own .
your trial is failing .
like it or not , you need her .
and you , even your mom ,
the great ellis grey , made a mistake .
you fixed hers . now fix your own .
get out of those ridiculous pink scrubs
and get back to the work you were born to do .
now the two of you are gonna figure out a way to work together ,
but you &apos;re not gonna do it on this field .
you &apos;ll do it monday morning in the lab . is that clear ?
yes .
mm @-@ hmm .
play ball !
we playing ball . playing ball .
all right . yes !
well , that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s gonna make it 12 @-@ nothing .
uh , how long are we gonna let this go on for ?
she &apos;ll get there .
if she can just get a better drive off the mound--
she &apos;s terrible .
yeah , she sucks .
oh . want to call it , hunt ? team &apos;s looking a little tired .
wouldn &apos;t want anyone napping in the o.r.
the last thing you guys need is a malpractice suit .
all right . we &apos;re pulling the pitcher .
shepherd , get your glove .
no , no , not me . lexie ...
get your glove . run out there .
wow . great job , hon .
you threw a really good game .
come on . let &apos;s--let &apos;s go ice your shoulder , huh ?
oh , no . i &apos;m--i &apos;m just warming up . get outta here .

no , no way . we got like-- like five more innings .

our last few moments together ?

i &apos;ve watched you work together , uh ,
solve problems together .
i watched you teach each other and learn from each other .
you ... step up when you need to .
and you ...
you do more than anyone asks you to do .
you &apos;re the finest team i &apos;ve ever been a part of .
oh , my god . what are you talking about ?
that &apos;s really sad .
beautiful .
you don &apos;t think we actually have a shot at winning this .
what , this ? this ? no , no , no , we &apos;re screwed .
you are all horrible at softball .
but as doctors ,
you &apos;re pretty great ,
and i am proud just to get to lead you ,
and you &apos;re all here , so i just ...
i just wanted to tell you .
but now ...
now we &apos;re going down .

we take chances .
we go for broke .
we swing for the fences .
and sometimes , yeah ,
we strike out .
well , thank you guys for , uh , letting me be your ringer .

we have a hearing .
we got a hearing .
we &apos;re getting a hearing .
