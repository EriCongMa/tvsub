For over a century i have lived in secret.
Until now. I know the risk,
but I have to know her.
What are you?
I'm a vampire.
Tell me about your ex. katherine?
She broke your heart.
That was a long time ago.
Why do i look like her?
What's your problem?
I don't know. ok?
So, the black sheep returns.
Tyler?
Who's the guy with Carol?
Mason Lockwood.
I think the Lockwoods have a family secret.
They're not vampires. They're something else.
I love Stefan. It's always going to be Stefan.
No, Damon. Stop it!
It's Katherine. She undid everything that was good about him.
I hate him, Stefan.
I've had her blood.
Katherine obviously killed her.
"A" plus "B" equals...
Because I'm starving.
Thanks for coming, Ric.
You need something to drink? Coffee? Bourbon?
Bourbon in your coffee?
Elena mentioned you needed my help.
Yeah. We were hoping you could help shed some light
on the Lockwood family.
Now, why would I know anything about the Lockwoods?
Well, you wouldn't. But your dead--
not dead vampire wife might.
Isobel's research,
from when you guys were at Duke together.
You said that she had spent years researching this town.
Isobel's research here-- Mystic Falls--
was rooted in folklore and legend.
At the time, I thought most of which was fiction.
Like that amazing vampire story.
Aside from vampires, what else?
Lycanthrope.
Wait. Like werewolves?
No way. Impossible. Way too Lon Chaney.
Is it?
I've been on this planet 160-some odd years.
I've never come across one.
If werewolves exist, where the hell are they?
Well, why do you suspect the Lockwoods?
Because vervain didn't effect the mayor on Founders' Day.
But the gilbert device did.
And it effected his son Tyler.
And at the school carnival, his uncle Mason exhibited
Inhuman behavior when he fought one of the carnival workers.
It suggested some sort of a supernatural entity.
We were hoping that Isobel's research
could help us figure out what it is.
A lot of her things are still at Duke.
I mean, her office is still there.
She's technically still missing.
So can we get access to it?
Ric, we need to know what we're dealing with.
If this wolfman thing is true,
I've seen enough movies to know it's not good.
It means that Mason Lockwood is a real-life Lon Chaney.
And that little Tyler punk may
just very well be Lon Chaney junior.
Which means Bela Lugosi-- meaning me--
is totally screwed.
Caroline?
Caroline?
It's Caroline. Leave a message.
Hey, I thought you said you were at home.
Tyler's doing a whole thing at the swimming hole.
And I wanted us to spend the day together.
Where are you? Call me.
You sure you want to do this?
Which part?
Digging through my birth mother's lifework
or going to Duke with damon?
Either. Both.
Well, I'm sure about the first part.
But then again, Ric is a good buffer.
So we can bond in our anti-damon solidarity.
I wish you were coming, though.
You know what, maybe we should wait a couple of days, huh?
Wait till Caroline's less of a danger,
And then I can go with you.
It's OK that I'm going, right?
And be honest. Because if it's
not then I can just stay here.
And we can take care of Caroline.
No, listen. I want you to go. OK? I do.
You have questions about your lineage and about Katherine.
Look, I'm not going to let the fact that Damon is going
keep you from an opportunity to get some answers.
You hate it, though.
I hate it. And I love you.
I love you, too.
It's been a while.
Well, school's been keeping me really busy.
I want you to know it means a lot to me
that elena has a connection to her mother.
I appreciate you bringing her along today.
Yeah. Well, I figured it was time to...
take care of my wife's things, you know?
Look, Jenna, I know...
things between you and I have been a little start and stop.
And I'm sorry for that.
But maybe once I can--
Uh, no. Don't do that.
Not the half, maybe apology, hope for the future thing.
Elena, you coming?
Do what you need to do, OK?
Hey, you OK?
Yeah. Just men and their baggage.
Sorry you can't come too, Stef.
Call me if you need anything.
Oh, I'll take really good care of her.
OK. Time to go.
Have you ever been down to those old ruins in the woods?
The old Lockwood estate?
Yeah. What do you know about it?
It was the original plantation house.
Beautiful antebellum architecture.
And if it hadn't burnt to the ground,
We'd probably be living in it.
What's the deal with the freaky underground cellar?
We don't talk about those kind of rooms.
Why not?
Well, this is the south, honey.
But no one likes to reminisce about the old slave days.
What are you guys talking about?
We were just talking about the old Lockwood property.
Thinking about having some friends over to the swim hole.
Well, be careful. If anything happens on the property,
the family is liable.
Of course.
I don't know how to make a daywalking ring.
Emily made mine. She made Damon's, too.
Instructions must be in the grimoire.
Doesn't mean I can cast a spell.
Bonnie.
You know how to drop vampires with a single look.
OK? I think you can figure it out.
Caroline killed someone, Stefan.
I can't make it easier for her to do it again.
No. We're not making it easier for her.
We're just giving her the chance to survive.
Listen, everyday that she's cut off from her old life--
From you, from Elena, from Matt--
It'll make it that much harder for her to hold on to her humanity.
And how do you know she won't hurt anyone else?
I don't.
But if we don't do everything we can to help her--
or at least trust the fact that she can keep it together,
we might as well just stake her right now.
I don't know if I can trust her.
Not with this.
Then trust me.
How you doing back there?
Leave her alone.
You know, this whole pretending to hate me thing is getting a little silly.
I don't think she's pretending.
You did kill her brother.
There is a huge asterisk next to that statement.
He came back to life.
Yeah. Thanks to a ring that you didn't know he was wearing.
Why are you so sure I didn't know?
Did you?
Yes.
You're lying.
Elena, I saw the ring.
Big tacky thing.
It's hard to miss.
So, I don't get to choose the ring I
have to wear the rest of my life
Hey, if you don't want it...
No. She--she wants it.
Now what?
Now's the part where I explain the rules.
The witch who spells the ring has the power to de-spell it.
So, if you ever do anything to hurt anyone...
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
You're a vampire.
That means the urge to kill is a part of who you are.
The minute you let it take over, I will stop you.
Bonnie, you're supposed to be my friend.
I can't ignore what happened. OK?
If you want to be friends, you're going to have to prove
that the Caroline I remember isn't gone.
Now, put the ring on the bed.
Do you really think I meant to
kill that guy at the carnival
He's still dead.
Now, do you want me to cast the spell or not?
All done.
So, that's it?
I mean, nothing witchy happened.
You know, no flickering lights, no gust of wind.
Have you even done this before?
Caroline...
Well, I just want to make sure it worked!
It worked.
What if it hadn't, Bonnie?!
She's all yours.
So Isobel was officially employed by the anthropology department,
given that most paranormal phenomena is rooted in folklore.
Excuse me. Hi, I'm Alaric Saltzman.
I called earlier.
Yes. Of course.
I'm Vanessa Monroe, research assistant--
comparative folklore.
Uh, let me just grab Isobel's keys.
I'm sorry. These are my friends Elena and Damon.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Please. Isobel's office is right through there.
Isobel was one of my first professors.
I'm a grad student. She was brilliant.
One of the reasons I went into folklore.
I have to ask...
has there been any news?
No. No. I'm afraid not.
It's right this way.
I'll grab the light. Feel free to look around.
It's fascinating, isn't it?
Where'd she go?
Pull it out. I can't reach it, Elena.
Just pull the damn thing out. It hurts.
That bitch is dead.
Uh, you're not going to kill her.
Watch me.
You touch her and I swear I will never speak to you again.
What makes you think that has any power over me?
'cause I took an arrow in the back for you?
You are severely overestimating yourself.
Right. I forgot that I was speaking to a psychotic mind
who snaps and kills people impulsively.
Fine. Go ahead. Do whatever you want.
You're trying to manipulate me.
If by "manipulate" you mean tell the truth, OK.
Guilty.
Please! OK. I freaked.
All right, you would have done the same thing.
It's not possible
Katherine Pierce can't be alive.
And Damon Salvatore died in 1864.
Ok. I read Isobel's research.
Well, then you should know just how possible this is.
I'm Elena Gilbert,
Isobel's daughter.
And a descendent of Katherine Pierce.
And this is Damon Salvatore, who you just shot.
I'd be extra nice to me right now.
Look. We need your help.
Ok. We need to see all of Isobel's research,
anything related to Mystic Falls.
So what do I do when I see the rabbit?
Chase it, catch it, feed on it.
Isn't killing cute, defenseless animals
the first step in becoming a serial killer?
Well, you sort of skipped serial killer
and went straight to vampire.
Hey, Caroline, if you're not serious about all this,
I think you should tell me.
No. I am.
Look, I swear that I am! Ok.
But it's just...
I haven't been in the sun for days.
And everyone's at the swimming hole having fun,
And Matt is there. And he finally told me that he loved me.
But I've been blowing him off.
And now you want me to eat bunnies.
And I'm kinda freaking out, ok?!
And now you're laughing at me.
No. no. I'm not laughing.
None of this is funny, trust me.
It's just that, uh...
What?!
When somebody becomes a vampire,
all their natural behaviors get sort of amplified.
What do you mean?
I mean, as a human I cared deeply
for people how they felt, if they were hurting,
I felt their pain.
And I felt guilty, if I was the one that caused it.
And as a vampire,
all of that got...
magnified.
So you're saying that now I'm basically an insecure,
neurotic, out of control freak on crack.
Well, I wasn't gonna say it like that.
But...
Hey, listen. Let's hunt. Ok?
And then after that,
we'll go to the swimming hole.
Really?!
Yeah.
Matt is the closet connection
that you have to your humanity.
And I think that being around him is a good thing.
Ok!
Come on.
Ok.
This box tracks Katherine's arrival to Mystic Falls
in April of 1864.
Is that all there is about her?
All that I'm aware of.
Here.
Take this.
Does vervain really work?
Nope! Not at all.
Can he hear us?
No! That would be creepy!
Can he read minds, too?
You know, if you want to see me naked,
all you have to do is ask.
No. That, he can't do.
He is very capable of being a first rate jackass.
Is it me, or did Amy Bradley's ass get hot?
All class.
Where's Forbes?
I wish I knew.
You guys on the outs already?
No. We're fine. I'm fine.
Just not sure what she is.
What's your uncle doing here?
You busting us, or you joining us?
Neither.
Hoping you can make sure everyone's out of here by dark.
What happens after dark?
Someone ends up wasted and dead
at the bottom of the lake.
You heard your mom. The family's liable if anything happens.
Don't be a party killer.
Hey, I didn't say you had to stop partying.
I just said you have to take it elsewhere.
All right.
We'll be out of here.
Why are you looking at him with your serious vampire look?
My what? My "serious vampire look"?
Mm-hmm. I mean, it's different from your worried vampire look.
Neither of which stray too far from your
"hey, it's Tuesday" look.
Oh. I get it. Ok.
You think I'm, uh, you think I'm too serious.
I mean, I wasn't going to say it like that. But...
Hey, Amy.
You know, you're missing all the fun in the water.
Ah, not waterproof.
Too bad.
So, there's a full moon tonight.
We gonna light a fire later and tell ghost stories?
Uh, I don't know.
Matt.
What the hell? I've been calling you.
I know, I got held up. But I'm here now.
Hey, Caroline.
Go find somebody single to stalk, Amy.
Seriously?
She was flirting with you.
She's harmless. You don't have to be rude.
You're mad?
You've been dodging my calls all day.
And you get to show up here and be the jealous girlfriend?
It's kinda lame, Care.
Hey, I saw that. You compelled her.
Yeah, she deserved it.
Caroline, nobody deserves to have their mind messed with for...
shallow reasons.
You know, why is everyone sticking up for
Amy freaking Bradley?
You're letting your jealousy get the best of you.
Oh, so now I have magnified jealousy issues too.
That's great.
I told you this wasn't going to be easy.
Yeah, well. Might as well have stayed dead.
My entire personality is killing me.
Shut up.
Any luck?
There's nothing in here about
Katherine that we don't already know.
Ah, man.
You know, it's a bummer we're not friends anymore.
Because I can tell you what I know.
Now who's manipulating who?
Hey, guys. Check this out.
There's no record of werewolf mythology in Mystic Falls.
But here are some records of some of the lesser known legends.
Everything from Scandinavian Skinwalkers to the Marshallderats.
Which roughly translates into
"the curse of the sun and moon."
It's native American.
Aztec.
It explains one origin of the werewolf
curse traced through Virginia.
The short story... 600 years ago,
The Aztecs were plagued by werewolves and vampires.
They terrorized the countryside,
made farming and hunting impossible.
Until an Aztec shaman cursed them,
Making vampires slaves to the sun and
werewolves servants of the moon.
As a result, vampires could only prowl at night,
and werewolves could only turn on a full moon.
When the full moon crests in the sky,
whosever unlucky enough to fall under
the werewolf curse turns into a wolf.
Can they control the transformation?
If it were a choice, it wouldn't be called a curse.
Werewolves will attack humans.
But instinct and centuries of rivalry
have hardwired them to hunt their prey of choice...
vampires.
Well, if werewolves are hunting vampires, I would know about it.
Not if there aren't that many werewolves left alive.
Hundreds of years ago, vampires hunted them almost to extinction.
Why would they do that?
To protect themselves.
Legend has it that a werewolf bite is fatal to vampires.
He's mad at me.
Go talk to him.
I'll wait.
Hi. Listen. We've learned some stuff here.
And I know it's going to sound crazy.
But I wanted to fill you in.
What's up?
Still mad?
I thought we were past all this insecurity stuff, Caroline.
I told you how I felt about you.
What more do you need?
Nothing. Nothing.
I-- I don't need anything else.
I'm sorry, Matt. I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.
I'm not kidding. I'm not going to put up with the drama.
No. No more drama.
Just-- I promise-- just.
Just this.
Come on.
I don't know what it means
or if we should even believe it.
But it's a full moon, Stefan.
After what you saw Mason Lockwood do--
I'll be careful.
There's one more thing.
What is it?
According to the legend, a werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
Listen, I gotta go.
I'll see you when you get home. Ok?
Ok.
Not much farther, Amy.
Really, Tyler? You drag me all the way out here?
I had to move the party. So I'm moving the party.
Where are we going?
It's right around this tree.
Are you sure?
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Ok.
What is this place?
It's a room buried underneath my family's old estate.
No one will know we're down here.
Is everyone else coming?
Yeah. Unless you rather I tell them not to.
You're single, right?
Oh, yeah.
Let's go.
Have you done any research on doppelgangers?
Well, the word means a lot of different
things to different cultures.
But typically a doppelganger
is a living, breathing double of oneself.
Did Isobel have anything that'd explain
the link between me and Katherine?
That's all she had on Katherine, unfortunately.
But I can tell you
that doppelgangers usually torment the people they look like,
Trying to undo their lives.
It's not exactly uplifting.
And more things we already know.
Just-- I want to know why we look alike.
Head- scratcher, isn't it?
Do you know something or are you just being yourself?
Well, "if" I know anything,
I'm not going to tell you, not with that attitude.
That's good, Damon.
And this is coming from someone who wants to be my friend.
But you know what?
Friends don't manipulate friends.
They help each other.
Wait. Wait. No. I'm sorry.
What's the deal? Come on.
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. I can't
I'm not into it.
Then why'd you come with me?
I don't know.
I'm not even really sure I was flirting with you.
I like Matt.
Ouch.
Um...ok.
I'm gonna go.
Yeah.
Sorry!
I mean...
I trust you not to say anything about this to anyone.
Or else Damon will kill me in my sleep?
He gave me the 411.
But if you need anything, you can call.
Hopefully I won't have to.
But if you do...
Listen, you don't want to get caught up in this.
Really. It'll take over.
And it'll keep you from being able to live your life.
Isobel's disappearance...
Was it related to her research?
Isobel became her research.
She wanted to become a vampire.
She got her wish.
I guess that would put a strain on a marriage.
Anyway, I was wondering
what it would be like to come back here.
It's uh... It's ok. It's really ok.
Feels good to...
Have her in my past.
You know, it's... time to move beyond this.
Here.
Allow me.
You're not going to be able to hate me forever.
Can we just go?
You didn't dig deep enough.
"Petrova."
I saw this on the shelf.
Katherine originally came from europe.
Petrova was her real name.
Katharina Petrova to be exact.
How did you know that?
Back when, I saw it engraved on an old heirloom.
Men snoop, too, you know.
Let me know what you find. Very curious myself.
You have every right to hate me.
I understand.
You hated me before and we became friends.
It would suck if that was gone forever.
So...
Is it?
Have I lost you forever?
Thank you for the book, Damon.
This looks like the spot.
For what?
Did you hear that?
What happens?
What are you doing?
Caroline?
Caroline! Caroline!
Caroline!
What the hell--your face!
Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop.
Oh, my god.
No, no, stop. Listen to me.
We need to get out of these woods now.
We need to leave.
What was that?
Matt, stay down. Do not move.
You and me, we're gonna run.
It's gonna follow us. We need to get it away from Matt.
So, you need to run as fast as you can.
Do you understand me?
Go. Go!
Wait! What is it?!
It's a werewolf!
It will try to kill us, and it can.
Hey! What are you two doing?
What are you doing?
No!
You are not gonna remember what I did to you
or what you saw me become.
We were just making out in the woods.
And then an animal attacked you
and bit your neck.
It's weird. It just came out of nowhere.
What are we going to do about Tyler?
I took care of it.
I'll get Matt on vervain.
It'll keep you from being able to compel him, but...
also keep you from being able to drink his blood.
I can't believe I hurt him.
I know.
He's the one person on this entire planet
that I never wanted to hurt.
It's not going to get any easier.
You're just going to have to work that much harder.
I shouldn't be with him, should I?
And if there's any danger...
I'm the last person to make that kind of decision for you.
If I followed my own advice,
I would have walked away from Elena a long time ago.
You ever think you should off?
I know I should off.
I just can't.
Wanna toss me those?
It was you.
Matt, hey.
I can't believe an animal attacked you.
Yeah. There have been a lot of animal attacks lately.
Well, are you ok?
I've been better. How are you?
I'm ok. I'm just-- I'm worried about you.
I'll be fine.
Ok.
Seriously, Amy?
We were just talking?
Oh, is that what you call it?
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm not, Matt.
She's into you. And anyone can see it.
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean--
I'm just gonna go.
Knock it off.
What are you doing?
This isn't my fault, Matt. Ok. She's after you.
And I shouldn't have to put up with that.
I thought you said no more drama.
Well, I lied.
Just forget it.
Just forget all of it.
So, what, are you, like, breaking up with me?
Yeah.
Yeah. I guess that's what I'm doing.
Ric, I wasn't expecting you and Elena till later.
I should have done that this morning.
Road trips work well for us.
This doesn't mean that things are back
to the way they used to be, Damon.
Oh, come on.
I know I chipped a little bit off of your wall of hatred.
I need to know the truth.
When you broke Jeremy's neck,
did you know that he was wearing the ring?
No.
No, I didn't.
Katherine really pissed me off. And I snapped.
And...
I got lucky with the ring.
And I don't know what I would have done if he wasn't wearing it.
Elena, I'm sorry.
Thank you for being honest with me.
And the answer to your question about our friendship...
is yes.
You have lost me forever.
You knew that already, didn't you?
You used me today.
You had information about katherine that I needed to know.
I thought friends don't manipulate friends.
You and katherine have a lot more in common than just your looks.
Elena?
Nope. Try again.
Katherine.
Don't be frightened.
