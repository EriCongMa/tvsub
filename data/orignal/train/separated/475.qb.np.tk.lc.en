the black queen
we &apos;ve got you , ms. garcia .
if you say so , suit .
we &apos;ve got evidence of your off @-@ site servers
and of your hack into the cosmetics company .
they test on animals .
yes , they do . but it &apos;s not illegal .
what you &apos;ve done is a felony and it &apos;s punishable by prison .
well , if you &apos;ve got me , j. edgar--
it &apos;s agent hotchner ,
and i &apos;m from the behavioral analysis unit .
and i &apos;m here to offer you an option to prison .
you come work for me .
you &apos;d be our technical analyst .
so i teach you how to use google , that kind of thing ?
that &apos;s fun .
you &apos;d help us hunt psychopaths .
i &apos;m a psychopath .
no , you &apos;re not .
in hacker circles you &apos;re known as the black queen .
and you are rigorously moral .
all of your online attacks reflect a fierce desire
to protect those who you think are being hurt .
if you accept my offer , you can do the same thing
for the federal government .
i just need a resume to give to human resources .
or we prosecute you .
well , i &apos;m not in the habit of bringing my resume
to events i am handcuffed at ,
but i have some stationery in my purse
and i &apos;ll write down some computer stuff i know and think about it .
i took out her phone and laptop .
everything else is harmless .
hotchner .
we &apos;ll be right there .
we have a suspect .
i need an answer .
yes , if i can keep my purse .
good choice .
do you have a key ?
beauty and brains .
hey , eyebrows .
when they do the men of the fbi calendar ,
is it just 12 months of you ?
welcome to the team .
so , let &apos;s talk about sexual harassment .
sexual harassment isn &apos;t always a quid pro quo arrangement .
maybe it &apos;s a conversation between two co @-@ workers
that makes you feel uncomfortable .
maybe these co @-@ workers use phrases like ...
&quot; baby girl . &quot;
&quot; chocolate thunder . &quot;
or ... &quot; where &apos;s my big black twelve @-@ pack ? &quot;
who blabbed ?
and that creates a what ?
a hostile work environment .
so messages like , &quot; more cushion for the pushing .. &quot;
not appropriate .
&quot; i &apos;ll be coco to your ice @-@ t . &quot;
not appropriate .
&quot; flarpy blunderguff . &quot;
i don &apos;t even know what that means ,
速到电梯口来见我
but not appropriate .
ms. garcia , you really have to stay for this .
i &apos;m sorry , but i got-- i--i have to--i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so--i &apos;m so , so sorry .
not appropriate .
oh , sir , i am so , so , so sorry about this .
take a look at this .
is this real ? is this happening ?
yes . and we &apos;re on our way
to the attorney general &apos;s office to explain it .
uh , when you say we , you mean the whole team or ...
i mean you and me .
in 2004 , the bau flew to san jose for two reasons .
one was to recruit garcia ,
the other was to arrest this man sam russell .
the prostitute killer .
8 victims . he didn &apos;t fit the profile exactly ,
but he waived his rights and admitted to all 8 .
isn &apos;t san quentin putting him to death in two weeks ?
yes . and we &apos;ve been tasked to review his conviction .
why us ?
garcia ?
ok . uh , this morning ,
the justice department website was hacked .
when you log on , you see this
and then this .
are these crime scene photos of the victims ?
the san jose police department was also hacked .
garcia says this must have been months in the planning .
any idea who &apos;s behind it ?
best guess is it &apos;s an online collective known as star chamber .
they &apos;re one of several justice oriented groups that sprung up
in the wake of the steubenville rape case .
star chamber . interesting name .
it &apos;s derived from a 17th century british court
designed to ensure fair enforcement of laws
against the rich and the powerful .
actually , according to my research ,
they named it that because it &apos;s also the name
of a mediocre yet awesome michael douglas movie from 1983 .
ok , but why sam russell ?
he confessed without any coercion .
because in addition to being a monster ,
sam russell is a hacker extraordinaire .
i don &apos;t know the man , but i learned from him .
so the star chamber is rallying behind one of their own
before the state of california can put him to death .
and we get thrown the political football
to make the negative attention go away .
we have to separate ourselves from the politics of it
and ensure that they &apos;re executing the right man .
&quot; people often say that this or that person
has not yet found himself .
but the self is not something one finds ,
it is something one creates . &quot;
thomas szasz .
well , looking at the history of star chamber ,
they love riddles .
so this message , &quot; they died in vein , &quot;
spelled v @-@ e @-@ i @-@ n ,
that &apos;s not just a homonym mistake , it &apos;s a clue .
yeah . that &apos;s their game--
&quot; we know something you don &apos;t . &quot;
they &apos;re fiercely libertarian and anti @-@ secrecy ,
which goes hand @-@ in @-@ hand with conspiracy theorizing .
as far as they &apos;re concerned ,
the whole sam russell thing is a cover @-@ up .
why did we close in on russell as a suspect ?
he was arrested repeatedly for solicitation .
all streetwalkers , all drug addicts .
his victims match that type .
well , you said he didn &apos;t fit the profile .
it sounds like he fit it perfectly .
there was an issue with m.o.
4 of the prostitutes were stabbed and 4 were strangled ,
and the unsub alternated between kills .
it sounds like two unsubs .
that was our profile until russell
confessed to everything ,
including names and details .
as far as we could tell , it was just him .
yeah , but we can &apos;t take that for granted .
dave , blake , and reid , go over the old files .
we need to re @-@ interview everyone associated with the old case .
morgan and garcia , dig into star chamber .
we don &apos;t want to validate them ,
but we need to know what they know .
and jj and i will go to san quentin .
om mani pame hum . om mani pame hum .
om mani pame hum . om mani pame hum ...
agent hotchner , thank you for coming .
this is agent jareau .
hi . good to meet you .
have a seat .
are those prayer beads ?
uh , yes . i don &apos;t go anywhere without them .
they &apos;re bound with hair ?
well , uh , i exist on death row , agent jareau .
hair is all i have left .
and these beads , they help me accept my fate
that i &apos;m gonna be murdered for crimes i did not commit .
this prison &apos;s filled with men who didn &apos;t do it .
why should we believe you ?
have you heard of desoxyn ?
it &apos;s a pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine
used to treat adhd and narcolepsy .
in 2004 , i found an internet black market that sold it ,
and when i started popping those pills like candy , i was gone .
i would just hack in 100 @-@ hour stretches , i &apos;d sleep for 4 .
i was an addict ...
not a killer .
so you &apos;re saying desoxyn
caused you to sign a confession to 8 murders ?
yes .
look , here &apos;s something you don &apos;t know .
the man who arrested me , detective bob cooper ,
he found my pills and then he introduced me to the good stuff ,
the i.v. stuff .
and the more prostitutes i confessed to killing ,
based on information that he fed me ,
the higher the dose .
and i never fully sobered up until last year
when i discovered buddhism , but by then it was too late .
no one would listen .
but the star chamber did .
that &apos;s their whole message , right ?
&quot; they died in vein &quot; ?
how are you communicating with them ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell you that .
i &apos;m not gonna let you interfere
with work they &apos;re doing on my behalf .
odd behavior from a supposedly innocent man .
you know what ? i &apos;ve howled for 10 years
against a system that wouldn &apos;t even notice me
until the star chamber embarrassed them ,
and then it noticed .
i &apos;m not gonna cooperate and help you find the star chamber .
they &apos;re the only ones fighting to keep me alive .
so , how long ago did you retire , detective ?
oh , about 4 years .
you know , they say that you never turn off being a cop , but , uh ,
i sure did .
detective cooper , we need to ask you a few questions
about the sam russell case .
oh , my pleasure , yeah . it &apos;s good to answer questions
that are gonna put this guy in the gas chamber
instead of taking him out .
someone claims that you fed russell drugs
in order to get the confession .
who ? who said that ?
it doesn &apos;t matter who .
oh , i bet it was those , uh , jackass computer nerds .
is it true ?
no , of course not .
i &apos;d be willing to swear on a stack of bibles if you want me to .
it &apos;s not true .
you know , it &apos;s interesting how much you can tell
about a person by what they choose to read .
this shelf , for instance ,
is devoted to ayn rand , christopher hitchens ,
richard dawkins , sam harris .
so ?
you &apos;re an atheist .
and your comment about the stack of bibles
is a linguistic tell .
you &apos;re overcompensating , which mean you &apos;re hiding something .
i--
that photograph you were admiring there--
you want to know who i &apos;m shaking hands with ?
i don &apos;t care .
well , i &apos;ll tell you . it &apos;s my union rep ,
local 151 . now , here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
when you people leave here ,
i &apos;m gonna get on the phone with my good buddy there
and he &apos;s going to issue a press release
saying that detective bob cooper
has devoted his entire career to justice .
so why is the fbi
keeping a serial killer who he caught
from receiving the justice that the brotherhood of police
fight and die for every day ?
i can &apos;t tell you how much we need your help .
your network security is tight .
it has to be . we &apos;re in hacker central here in silicon valley .
we ramped up after we digitized all our case files ,
but whoever did this left a bomb behind .
a bomb ?
he means a trojan horse ,
so whenever you try to source the hack ,
pieces of the code self @-@ delete ,
which means the star chamber
has pretty much all of the sam russell file .
you &apos;ve seen this before ? because it took our backup file
and the district attorney &apos;s .
yeah , i may have helped design this ,
back when i was a sort of bad guy .
but i &apos;m gonna see what i can do to rebuild it .
let me know if you need any help .
yeah , i am not rebuilding jack .
whoever did that is amazing .
come on , not as amazing as you .
pretty amazing .
and he started with an sql injection .
that &apos;s no big deal .
you could download a patch to fight it off ,
but it &apos;s the patch that contains the trojan horse .
like taking a flu shot filled with cancer .
exactly .
maybe i could find a clue in the code
to figure out who the culprit is .
just do that thing that you do , baby girl .
ok . we have to stop this .
stop what ?
derek , the fbi is organizing seminars on the way we &apos;ve talk .
so what ?
so it &apos;s embarrassing .
not to me .
i am not about to change how i am with you
because bob in payroll doesn &apos;t get the joke .
look , i like the way we talk .
just can we cool it for a bit , please ?
fine .
only because you &apos;re asking .
however , but before we play this little game of yours ,
i want to know what this blunderguff thing is .
that is a conversation between jj and i that i will--
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
what ?
i have to talk to hotch .
this is the client &apos;s address ?
yeah , this is it ?
huh . homey .
whenever a guy books a two @-@ fer , you have to wonder .
not me . i tell the sitter i &apos;ll be home early ,
because they book us for all night
and then we &apos;re out the door after 15 minutes .
20 , tops .
welcome .
ok . we need to have a little primer on hacking .
because i think i &apos;ve figured out the member of the star chamber
who &apos;s behind all this .
and who is he ?
i &apos;m gonna take a guess based on the signature .
hackers have signatures ?
sometimes . usually it &apos;s a message in the code
to let other pros know , hey , this one was me .
and in this case , the signature matches the doj hack ,
and it is , &quot; happy fun meow meow . &quot;
sorry , what ?
happy fun meow meow .
what the hell does that mean ?
it was garcia &apos;s signature before she joined the bau .
none of this has been an accident .
getting us to review the case ,
leaving that clue ,
and there is only one man old enough
and has the kind of crazy kung fu to do it .
his name is shane wyeth , and he is my old ...
hacking mentor .
do you think you can get him to come to the table ?
we need the file to reexamine russell &apos;s confession .
if russell &apos;s innocent , we &apos;ll need it for clues
to find the identity of the real killer .
that &apos;s not gonna be easy .
shane and i ended on terrible terms .
he was more than just a mentor , wasn &apos;t he ?
please , let me go .
please ...
don &apos;t . no--
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
hold my--hold my hand .
my lawyer told me the news this morning .
two more prostitutes . one stabbed , one strangled .
it &apos;s a tragedy .
a tragedy that helps your case .
i need to talk to shane wyeth .
he &apos;s the member of the star chamber .
you &apos;ve been in contact with , correct ?
that depends .
are you gonna arrest him ?
no .
how can i trust that ?
because i don &apos;t think you did this .
and i need the file that he stole in order to prove it .
so how do i contact him ?
shane will speak with the black queen .
the black queen only .
just set up an internet relay chat room ,
and from there they can arrange a meeting on neutral turf .
there are millions if irc channels . i need a name .
hashtag hail to the king .
you really think he &apos;s innocent ?
i know he &apos;s hiding something ,
but i couldn &apos;t let him know that .
ok , we got what we needed . how do we play it to our advantage ?
we don &apos;t . we can &apos;t .
we do it shane &apos;s way .
no , garcia , it &apos;s too early to make that call .
sir , i &apos;m not happy about any of this ,
but people are still dying , right ?
all right , you arrange the meet and we &apos;ll deliver the profile .
at this point we &apos;ve got two working theories about this case .
we need to give both of them equal weight .
the first is that unpleasant as it may be to admit ,
sam russell was wrongly convicted
and the real killer has struck again .
if that &apos;s the case , this unsub is controlled enough
to stay dormant for 10 years .
but russell &apos;s impending execution
has brought him back to the surface .
dennis rader , the btk killer ,
went dormant for 16 years .
but later sent letters
to the media claiming credit for his crimes .
and last night &apos;s murder could serve as a similar message to us .
the other theory is we have a copycat
and he &apos;s trying to cast doubt on russell &apos;s conviction .
to copy the case this accurately ,
the unsub would have to have access to the original case file .
and since the star chamber has that file ,
we think he &apos;s one of their members .
certain types of hackers thrive on the cachet of infamy .
this unsub wants to show his peers that he &apos;s so evil ,
he can commit the murders that russell didn &apos;t .
and whichever of these theories turns out to be correct ,
the key to finding this unsub
is comparing last night &apos;s murder to 2004 .
how are you gonna do that when we don &apos;t have the file anymore ?
we have an expert working on it right now .
testing .
ok , keep going . i want to test the signal .
tell me about the meet .
uh , it &apos;s happening at a local access network gaming center .
it &apos;s a good place for hackers to hide .
all right , that &apos;s good .
i feel like i &apos;m gonna barf .
ok , hey . hey , hey .
i &apos;m gonna be in the van right outside .
if you get in trouble , i will be on you before you--
i will be there .
wow . you were gonna marry this guy , weren &apos;t you ?
no .
no , no .
no ?
no .
ok , then what ?
because i have never seen you like this before .
after my parents died , i went through this period
where i was even more comfortable than i am now
in front of a computer than in front of people .
you know , a computer can &apos;t surprise you
or hurt you or die without saying good @-@ bye .
and ...
shane figured that out about me .
and he made me feel really ...
safe ?
yes . and he did it by telling me i was never going to die .
he recorded almost everything i said and i did .
so it was like i was gonna live forever .
that &apos;s kind of romantic , i guess .
i guess . until you get in a fight .
and then it &apos;s like , would you please put down the freakin &apos; camera
and can we talk like normal people , and ...
you know , i &apos;m stubborn .
oh , yeah . just a little bit .
no , but it was like we &apos;d get--we would get in these fights ,
and--and then ...
he liked fighting , a lot .
he liked winning .
and i had become this person
that i never intended to be .
so i stopped being that person ,
and when i stopped being that person , i couldn &apos;t be with shane .
and i never looked back .
good .
because you &apos;ve come a long way .
it &apos;s time .
time for what ?
isn &apos;t it obvious , eyebrows ?
i have to get into character .
shane ?
shane !
需要信用卡预授权
what ?
i need another hour , shane .
no .
come on . comp me 15 minutes .
did you learn nothing from your date with your sister ?
no means no .
now , either give me your mom &apos;s credit card or get out .
hey , shane.- what &apos;s up ?
what the hell , man ? we just got knocked offline .
what do you mean ?
what is going on ?
she &apos;s back .
very nice .
you ...
you &apos;ve lost weight .
you miss me ?
no .
ok .
why don &apos;t you , uh ...
prove it ?
i &apos;m going to kiss you .
ok .
thank you .
we have a lot to talk about .
yes , we do .
so , we dug into both victims &apos; lives .
they worked for separate agencies
but went freelance about two months ago .
not a surprise .
we &apos;ve seen how the internet has revolutionized the sex industry .
it &apos;s taken it off the streets
and allowed the women to control their own clientele .
that could be how the unsub crossed paths with them .
we thought that , too , but when we looked
at cell and computer records , the data fields were empty .
for both women ?
well , if it was just one , we &apos;d chalk it up to chance or luck ,
but two &apos;s a pattern .
and if the unsub &apos;s good with computers ,
he could have erased everything .
we need to dig deeper into their online lives ,
match his expertise with our own .
well , unfortunately , our expertise is in the field right now .
just give us the file back .
you &apos;re asking me to cooperate with the fbi .
i am asking you to do the right thing .
this is not about proving whether russell is innocent , ok ?
look , two more women died last night--
yeah , i know . &apos; cause of that ,
i should hand the keys to the car back to the morons
who crashed it in the first place ?
i took the file to make you rebuild the case from scratch
because you and the genius squad
missed a couple kind of important things .
like the silent partner .
you have no idea who that is , do you ?
can we stop ?
your team floated two killers .
there &apos;s been an inside man the whole time .
you completely overlooked him .
you &apos;re the fbi , for god &apos;s sake .
can we stop ? shane , please , can we stop ?
can we just talk like normal people for a second ?
yeah , sure . yeah , yeah , yeah .
yeah , let &apos;s talk like normal people .
how &apos;s your mom ?
she died .
7 years ago .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i posted a thing .
i can &apos;t--
i made a deal with the fbi .
i &apos;m not allowed to get in touch with you ,
with guys like you .
why did you do it ? why did you go to their side ?
i got caught .
you got caught ?
you walked in .
you walked in &apos; cause you were too scared to stay with me .
i wanted a different life , maybe .
well , you got one , didn &apos;t you ?
baby girl .
you don &apos;t even know what that means .
i know the texts i saw .
and whoever this guys is , the one i assume you &apos;re sleeping with ,
he did the impossible . he managed to take the strongest ,
toughest woman i &apos;ve ever met in my life
and he infantalized her .
we &apos;re not sleeping together .
well , that makes it worse . that means you infantalized yourself .
who are you ?
&apos;cause the woman i loved ...
she &apos;s gone .
a little wine .
i am good . thanks .
can i use your bathroom ?
sure . down the hall to the left .
what are you doing ?
no. no , no , no--
no !
then the m.o. was mixed ?
only one victim ,
but he strangled her and then stabbed her .
it could be an evolution .
or he &apos;s trying to cast more doubt on russell .
her name is debbie bloom .
she went freelance two months ago ,
and when she did , all traces of her business vanished .
exactly like the previous two victims .
what if we &apos;re thinking about the m.o. wrong ?
what if the unsub didn &apos;t erase the data ,
but the call girls were simply hiding it
from law enforcement ?
and the unsub figured out a way to use it to his advantage ?
well , blake found one potential lead .
it was the last client that debbie kept
before she went off the grid .
goes by the name of mr. smith .
will mr. smith talk to us ?
well , once blake promised that we wouldn &apos;t ruin his marriage .
she &apos;s bringing him in now .
who &apos;s that ?
mr. smith .
it &apos;s so unfair .
going off the grid was supposed to make things safer for her .
the man we &apos;re looking for knew she was off the grid
and it &apos;s keeping us from finding him .
can you help us figure this out ?
i , uh , actually helped her set it up .
there &apos;s apps now .
online calendars , phone calls over wi @-@ fi ,
even payment through this thing called bitcoin ,
where you can have it converted into cash .
don &apos;t those still leave breadcrumbs on the internet ?
it was all encrypted .
if she didn &apos;t log in every 12 hours ,
all the data erases itself .
so it couldn &apos;t be used against her if she got arrested .
so how did you figure all this out ?
debbie found a post online .
um , we looked at it so much , i bookmarked it .
can i see ?
it &apos;s one of those long posts with step @-@ by @-@ step instructions .
if this is how debbie hid in plain sight ,
it &apos;s a good bet that gloria and marguerite did , too .
maybe the unsub wrote that in order to prey on his victims .
the unsub didn &apos;t write it .
based on the verbiage , syntax , and organizational structure ,
i can tell you who did .
sam russell .
come on .
take the cheese .
what &apos;s going on ?
i was sick of being behind the eightball ,
so i found a back door on shane &apos;s work server .
looks like he found you .
that &apos;s the point .
i wanted him to find me .
and now , invite him in ,
and we start to play .
you found a blind spot .
i &apos;m impressed .
why are we here ?
when we would fight ...
this is how we made up .
so , figure , since this is the best way we communicated ,
maybe i can use it to talk some sense into you .
yeah , actually , uh ,
i think this was the best way we communicated .
remember ?
i do .
i remember when you talking sense
sounded like this .
there is zero point in following the law ,
because the whole thing is corrupt .
and nothing is going to make me happier
than to watch the whole stupid thing
burn to the ground--
the government , the police , the feds ,
every shred of it .
burn , burn , burn .
how &apos;s that feeling ?
oh , my god . oh , my god !
calm down .
you saw that .
yes , i did .
he &apos;s jut trying to get under your skin .
it &apos;s working .
forget about what he &apos;s doing and focus on why .
he &apos;s a narcissist , right ?
he &apos;s a game player .
garcia , those guys are easy to manipulate
because they always overplay their hand .
no . not shane . shane does not lose .
he lost something 10 years ago , didn &apos;t he ?
he doesn &apos;t care about russell , garcia .
he wants you .
he wants you to one last time say that he won .
ok . if that &apos;s true ,
how do i use that against him ?
sit down .
come on .
just wait for his opening .
you &apos;ll know it when you see it .
you can do this .
i can do this .
i can do this .
ok , i &apos;m really embarrassed .
good job .
you embarrassed me .
that doesn &apos;t matter . here &apos;s why .
i grew up , sort of ,
and i figured out that the revolution isn &apos;t going to come
over a t1 line .
i have learned new tricks .
who &apos;d you learn them from ? from him ?
derek , the fbi &apos;s organizing seminars on the way we talk .
so ?
so it &apos;s embarrassing .
not to me . i &apos;m not about to change the way i am with you
because bob in payroll doesn &apos;t get the joke .
i like the way we talk ...
you &apos;ve been following me this whole time ?
yep . you and supervisory very special agent derek morgan .
are you surprised ?
but really , honey , you chose this guy ?
you chose a brainless , metrosexual
action figure ?
that &apos;s his opening .
yes , it is . now tell me why .
because the last time he said he didn &apos;t know who you were , but he does .
he sees us having a relationship
that he doesn &apos;t get to have anymore and it &apos;s driving him crazy .
i told him we &apos;re not sleeping together .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
his narcissistic brain won &apos;t accept
that we could ever be friends .
so he thinks he can beat me by beating us ?
so what &apos;s your next move , baby girl ?
new game .
two teams--
bau versus star chamber .
we see who can find the new killer first .
but we do it on an equal playing field .
which means you give us the sam russell file back ...
and we give you our profile .
when i win , what do i get ?
when you log on to the doj website ,
there &apos;ll be a picture of me
and super special agent derek morgan ...
with shoes on our heads .
he just left the table .
did he take the bait ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s the shoe on the head mean ?
ah , it &apos;s an internet thing .
hello .
i &apos;ve got mail .
we got the file .
you know , i hate to admit it ,
but the star chamber did an impressive job .
they took the police file
and annotated it with their own research .
is there any other evidence ? &apos; cause i &apos;m not seeing anything .
there &apos;s one thing we missed .
back in 2004 , russell had a silent hacking partner
in charge of money and infrastructure
who remained hidden in the shadows .
they think the silent partner committed the murders
and let russell take the fall for it .
two unsubs would explain it .
we profiled that 10 years ago .
what if the silent partner was also the killing partner ?
well , that would mean that
russell admitted to 4 murders he didn &apos;t commit .
why not just cut a deal and name the partner ?
because he &apos;d still get life in prison .
it beats a death sentence .
not if you think you can beat the system ,
and hackers always think they can do that ,
especially if you had help from the outside .
then that &apos;s why the partner surfaced now .
this whole time we &apos;ve been
trying to figure out which profile is right ,
the dormant killer or the copycat . but the answer is both .
ok , but how do we prove it ?
if we can &apos;t , we &apos;re no better than the star chamber .
yeah , hotch . i think we may have something .
yeah , i wrote this post .
i told shane to put it up on reddit .
why would you care so much about how prostitutes do business ?
because i think sex work should be safe and legal .
the internet can de @-@ stigmatize it .
and make it easier for predators to prey on victims .
well , i agree . that &apos;s why you should really catch that predator .
there &apos;s something else we need to discuss .
when we got the files back from the star chamber ,
we noticed a detail about the strangulations we hadn &apos;t seen before .
what we noticed about the killer
is when he was choking out these women ,
their hair--their hair would collect around their throats ,
like this .
and he would grip it so tight ...
he would rip the hair out by the roots .
so , we realized the old killer &apos;s signature
that the new killer didn &apos;t copy ...
was hair .
your partner on the outside fed that to you ,
and every time you got a lock of your victim &apos;s hair
it was a promise that your plan was still in motion
and that he &apos;d get you off .
well , instead , the two of you are going to die in here together .
let me explain to you what &apos;s going to happen .
we &apos;re gonna go to the governor
and he &apos;s going to halt your execution
and withdraw the charges for the first murders .
and then we &apos;re going to retry you for the other 4 murders .
that &apos;s mine . you gotta-- give it back .
give it back !
stop ! it &apos;s mine !
come on .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
what is ?
the fbi profile on the guy sam russell &apos;s in prison for .
how &apos;d you hack that ?
i didn &apos;t .
they gave it to me .
really ? !
what &apos;s it say ?
nothing . it &apos;s completely generic .
all they &apos;ve got is the guy could be an underground hacker .
which could be any of us .
that &apos;s good .
good ?
yeah , good .
because they &apos;ll think it &apos;s you .
what are you --
no ...
clear here .
clear .
yeah , shane &apos;s car &apos;s here , he &apos;s not .
all right . garcia may have another lead .
there &apos;s something hinky about some stuff shane bought online .
there it is .
oxycodone .
would shane use it recreationally ?
no way . shane &apos;s one of those people ,
well , like his body is his temple .
he wouldn &apos;t take anything to pollute it .
the unsub must have bought this in shane &apos;s name .
where were the drugs sent ?
to an address , in shane &apos;s name ,
in silicon valley that there &apos;s no way he could afford .
all right , morgan , go , take reid with you .
garcia , i want you on site , too , scanning the networks .
yes , sir .
no ...
oh , god , you used me .
oh , shane .
you wanted to be used .
you took my money ,
and you hoarded my servers
for your little crusade .
and none of that
is free .
even those women knew that .
and so ...
now it &apos;s time for you
to be so overwhelmed with guilt
that you ...
kill yourself .
fbi !
drop the needle . let me see your hands .
how much did you give him ?
figure it out .
stand down .
standing down .
quick , pull up his shirt , morgan .
oh , my god .
nothing .
paramedics are on their way . you got anything else over there ?
norepinephrine . it might kill him .
wait . just wait .
shane , i know you &apos;re in there ,
and i know you can hear me .
hey . i won , shane .
and if you die on me ,
i &apos;m gonna tell everybody we know
i won .
do it . do it now .
you got lucky .
yes , i did .
this is the one . this is the last --
wait -- no , wait .
no ...
that &apos;s the one . that &apos;s the --
hold on . ok , one more . i &apos;m sorry .
ok , i &apos;m stopping .
we used to make fun of chicks like you .
no . you used to make fun of chicks like me .
this is who i always wanted to be ,
and i was too afraid to tell you
because i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d like me .
do you ever miss her ?
&apos;cause i do .
take such good care of yourself , shane .
goodbye .
goodbye .
so ... i have a confession to make .
you are not the first guy to call me baby girl .
get outta here .
it &apos;s true .
it better not be that guy .
oh , no . uh @-@ uh .
actually , it was a different guy .
ok , i &apos;ll bite .
how did this pretender to the throne
end up stealing my fire ?
i &apos;m going to tell you , but first ,
i have to explain an explicit ,
sexually inappropriate detail --
what a flarpy blunderguff is .
ok . so , you need like an oil @-@ based paint
and some charcoal
and some sort of food that you love ,
i mean love , because you are gonna be with it ...
&quot; to invent your own life &apos;s meaning is not easy .
but it &apos;s still allowed .
and i think you &apos;ll be happier for the trouble . &quot;
