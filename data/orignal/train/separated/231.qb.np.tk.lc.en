gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
my goal was to remake nate ,
not to make you the star .
it &apos;s time for you to step aside .
which means that all her readers will flock to you ,
mr. new editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
ivy ?
max .
my ex @-@ boyfriend just shows up out of nowhere .
the truth is gonna come out any second .
i &apos;m looking for someone named ivy .
i think some people here might call her &quot; charlie . &quot;
my mom never wanted me
to grow up with the burden of the rhodes name .
i knew your mother was bebend this .
everything you say is a lie .
the money is real .
just stay away from me and my family .
i forgive you .
so that means you &apos;re willing to give me a shot ?
one more .
can you please tell me
why people are not paying attention to me right now ?
it was you who uploaded that page , wasn &apos;t it ?
i was trying to show you what your friends are really like .
i think i need time alone
to think about the future of our relationship .
you &apos;ve really been good this whole time ,
haven &apos;t you ?
on the upper east side ,
stayin &apos; alive isn &apos;t as easy as it appears .
and after last week &apos;s security breach
leading to no new tips ,
it looks like i might be dancing with myself .
i &apos;ve never seen so much lame before .
but grandma actually wore this ?
yes , and looked fabulous riding in on an elephant in it ,
which is why the studio 54 anniversary party
is in her honor ... and bianca jagger &apos;s ,
but we won &apos;t mention that to her when she arrives .
bianca was a striver .
she could never outshine me no matter how little she wore .
oh , mother ! it &apos;s wonderful to see you .
darling .
charlotte .
oh , new york agrees with you .
you look fabulous .
i just got off the phone with ian schrager .
he sends his love .
he said he &apos;s recreating the entire club
down to the moon and the spoon .
and i am going to wear that platinum jumpsuit
that prompted ryan o &apos;neal to propose .
now that he &apos;s a widower , i put him on the guest list .
speaking of which ,
what did you decide to do about inviting carol ?
i thought i &apos;d leave the drama this year up to barry and diane .
yes , well , she does have a way of blowing things up .
i have all the family i need with you
and my two favorite granddaughters .
24 hours in the city that never sleeps .
quite an accomplishment for my blog
and for you , country boy .
i grew up in miami .
i was impressed by your moves at bunker hill .
i can &apos;t feel my feet ,
and for once , i can &apos;t blame alaia or giuseppe .
ah , i don &apos;t know those dudes .
i do know those 4 am soup dumplings
put david chang to shame .
momofuk @-@ who ?
and what about absinthe at apotheke ?
and the sunrise over the high line ?
how can anyone not love new york ?
well , if you &apos;re not sick of me yet ,
you wanna show me some more later today ?
i would love to ,
but i have this thing at studio 54 .
my grandma is the guest of honor ,
which would shock you if you ever met her .
but , uh , i promised i &apos;d pick up the cake .
why would you trust an anonymous baker
when you have a master chef in your midst ?
you could be my sous for the afternoon .
could we cover ourselves in flour and lick spoons
and do other cute things ?
that &apos;s a prerequisite .
then i can &apos;t wait to don my chef whites .
i &apos;ll call you later .
okay .
now that &apos;s what i like to see-- you writing again .
what is it ? sophomore novel ? short story ?
well , it &apos;s more like a rebuttal .
these online haters are like cockroaches .
you kill one , and then three more pop up in its place .
you &apos;re not seriously being the kind of author
that fights every negative review on amazon ?
i mean , people will think you &apos;ve lost your mind .
which is why i have danfan ,
the tireless online avatar i &apos;ve created to fend off critics .
alessandra isn &apos;t returning my calls ,
so i gotta fight this battle on my own .
that &apos;s it . i stay quiet
while you crashed bridal showers
and skipped out on book tours .
i was hoping with enough time and support that you &apos;d realize
that even though your book didn &apos;t do as well as you hoped ,
you still have your whole future ahead of you .
being a shut @-@ in is not bouncing back .
i was defending my honor .
it &apos;s time to leave &quot; inside &quot; behind and go outside .
cece &apos;s party &apos;s tonight . i expect you to be there .
looks like i &apos;m not the only one everyone despises .
lonely boy &apos;s fans are slowly dwindling ,
but his haters are going forth and multiplying .
my personal favorite ?
@ ihatehumphrey .
why should i thank someone for a blender ?
do i look like the kind of girl who makes margaritas ?
oh , margarita sound delicious .
but six month away at least .
any correspondence from mr. louis ?
no . i told you .
he &apos;s doing missionary work with father cavalia
in some nation without plumbing
and waiting for my call .
but wedding still on ?
of course it is .
i still love louis . i just want to marry
the sweet prince who returned my vivier slipper
and made me believe in fairy tales ,
not one of the brothers grimm .
even prince charming can fall off horse .
but louis still hasn &apos;t found his way back in the saddle .
shocking for someone schooled
in classical dressage .
i need this time apart to figure out
where louis went wrong and right it .
maybe he &quot; freaky friday &quot; with mr. chuck .
they struck by lightning at same time ,
or pee in same fountain .
that &apos;s incredibly unsanitary .
but you may be on to the key to returning louis &apos; virtue .
i am ?
finish these .
no polish parables .
i know i &apos;m the new kid around here
and i &apos;m gonna make some mistakes .
i just want you guys to know
that i &apos;m not gonna resort to
the kind of dirty tactics that diana used .
&quot; spectator &quot; only publishes truth .
and yeah , sex sells , but if the story involves scandal ,
it needs to be verified .
we have an opportunity to do things differently here .
so i &apos;m around if anyone has any stories they &apos;d like to pitch .
thanks .
nate ?
i &apos;ve got a lead
on a famous congressman &apos;s wife who &apos;s having an affair .
well , we &apos;ve heard that story a million times .
do we have a new angle ?
what was going on in washington at the time ?
does the wife want to come clean ? dig deeper .
before i do , you should know
the congressman is your cousin tripp van der bilt .
you got my money yet ?
i &apos;m working on it .
i can &apos;t just walk into a bank and withdraw $ 500,000 .
well , in case you &apos;re lying ,
like you do about everything else ,
i found myself an insurance policy .
in fact , i &apos;m dating her--
serena van der woodsen . have you heard of her ?
what ?
y @-@ you can &apos;t date serena .
too late . and unless i get the money soon ,
one of our dates will involve a bottle of champagne
and revelations about who you really are .
uh , should i show her this playbill i keep in my pocket
before or after the caviar ?
i told you . i just need a little more time .
why can &apos;t you leave serena out of it ?
because i &apos;m having fun with her .
listen ....
the more she likes me , the more she trusts me ,
and the more likely she is to believe me when i tell her
that charlie rhodes
is just a white trash wanna be named ivy dickens .
well , don &apos;t let lily see you together .
she knows our history ,
and if she tells serena that we used to date ,
she &apos;ll get suspicious .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not gonna risk a lifetime of financial security
for brunch with the in @-@ laws .
hi . we have a problem .
yeah , well , add this one to the list .
max is dating serena .
if you don &apos;t me to leave or get caught ,
we have to pay him off immediately .
except we don &apos;t have the money .
i just came from the bank .
turns out my mother &apos;s added a security measure
to the account-- probably to punish me .
any withdrawal over $ 50,000 requires her signature ,
which she will never agree to if we ask .
we have to make her think it was her idea .
i barely know her , and she &apos;s not speaking to you .
the money is the only thing that will stop max from outing me .
you keep serena away from max .
i will work on my mother .
looks like i &apos;m not the only one doing the hustle .
perhaps i should feather my hair tonight .
i never really understood why it went out of fashion .
for you , mother .
from ryan .
how thoughtful .
although i prefer vanda orchids .
how about lilies of the valley ?
more like &quot; valley of the dolls &quot; now that you &apos;ve arrived .
i am here to reconstruct ,
not self @-@ destruct . i promise .
to honor the guest of honor .
i hope my invitation was lost in the ...
mail .
it &apos;s a lovely thought , but it wasn &apos;t .
so what do you really want ?
forgiveness .
if this is about my cutting off charlie &apos;s funds ...
i admit i made some mistakes in trying to protect her .
but she &apos;s forgiven me .
in fact , we &apos;re closer than ever .
funny . she lives with me ,
and this is the first i &apos;m hearing of this .
well , why else would she suggest i come for the party ?
we &apos;re both hoping that studio 54
would bring the rhodes girls back together .
well , you know , nothing makes me happier
than when my family gets along .
that is , if you both can do that .
of course , mother . it &apos;s your night .
however , i will not tolerate
any outbursts or judgmental tantrums .
i am supposed to be the center of attention tonight ,
and i &apos;d like to keep it that way .
i promise .
now let &apos;s get those flowerss into some water .
um , how could you be working
when you have a date to be discussed ?
spill !
well , there &apos;s not much to say .
max and i spent the whole night together ,
wandering the city .
is this the same max
that was supposed to meet you at &quot; sleep no more &quot; ?
yes , but if i wouldn &apos;t have given him a second chance ,
i never would &apos;ve seen how great he is .
we &apos;re spending the afternoon baking cece a cake .
is that not the sweetest thing you &apos;ve ever heard ?
sure ...
if he hadn &apos;t stood you up once already .
maybe you shouldn &apos;t rush into this .
where is this coming from ?
you were the one who encouraged me to get out there and date .
well ... i mean , for your blog .
now that that &apos;s a bona fide success ,
i just don &apos;t wanna see you
revert to old serena &apos;s taste in men .
oh , max could not be further from the men i &apos;ve dated .
he moved here from portland . he hikes .
okay .
maybe he hasn &apos;t done hard time like the last one .
but didn &apos;t you say
he came to new york to find his ex @-@ girlfriend ?
yeah , i forgot about her .
ivy .
i mean , he did cross the country to see her .
part of him must still love her .
well , anyway , two dates in one day could be--
could be moving too fast .
always better to leave &apos; em wanting more .
okay , i &apos;ll cancel my baking date .
oh , i have to reorder the cake now .
yeah .
i have to go get cece some glitter eye shadow .
she said something about
lighting up the night with her liner .
oh , no .
yeah .
namaste .
sorry to interrupt
you getting into someone &apos;s yoga pants .
sri sri ravi , a moment , please .
an old , celibate ,
male yoga teacher ?
your transformation really is astounding .
care to share how you gave up your bad bass ways ?
how you went from charlie sheen to charlie brown ,
查理 · 布朗是 &lt; &lt; 史努比 &gt; &gt; 中的卡通人物
from bar to mitzvah ?
there &apos;s no answer to that question . it &apos;s an evolution .
what &apos;s really going on , blair ?
okay , if you must know ,
i &apos;m trying to pinpoint the source of your light
so i can pull louis out of the darkness .
you changed . so can he .
i have all day .
oh , it was great meeting your new staff .
from what i can see ,
jared kushner better watch his back .
thanks .
before you leave , there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
one of my reporters received a tip .
maureen &apos;s cheating on tripp .
well , there must some mistake .
maureen &apos;s a devoted wife .
she even stuck by tripp during that , uh ,
unfortunate incident with serena .
obviously , we &apos;ll verify everything first .
you &apos;re not seriously considering running it ?
well , the information &apos;s out there ,
and if we don &apos;t , someone else will .
and i don &apos;t wanna make a certain australian patriarch &apos;s mistake
of burying the &quot; news of the world &quot; scandal .
if he &apos;d let the &quot; journal &quot; break it ,
he might &apos;ve saved his paper and a lot of embarrassment .
but , uh , this is a family matter .
and a public one , unfortunately .
it &apos;s our chance to prove
that &quot; the spectator &quot; is fair and balanced
no matter what the story is .
the site and our family
will be in better shape for running it first .
well , i certainly don &apos;t want it in the hands of the &quot; post . &quot;
i won &apos;t run anything before i talk to trip .
i was wrong in keeping you from here .
the city looks good on you .
i just wish i could visit more often .
but , you know , lily &apos;s doing so much
by letting you stay here . i just ...
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable by putting her out .
i never thought i would say this ,
maybe it &apos;s time to get your own place .
yeah , but the prices are so crazy .
you &apos;ve got more than that in your trust fund .
we could get you a beautiful 1 @-@ bedroom .
it &apos;s better to buy it than rent it .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s a good investment .
that &apos;s enough . do you have me pegged as a fool ?
coming here under the guise of a party
and trying to get me to buy you an apartment ?
it &apos;s not for me . it &apos;s for charlie .
if it was charlie , she would have asked me herself .
once again , carol , you &apos;re all dollars and no sense .
and i am done being taken advantage of
and enabling your agendas .
my only agenda is to get closer to my daughter--
something you &apos;ll never understand .
i &apos;m going for a walk ,
on the streets , where i &apos;m welcome .
mom , please .
grandma .
grandma , are you all right ?
yes . o @-@ of course i am .
maybe i should call an ambulance .
oh , no , honey . your--your--
your mother just triggered my blood pressure , that &apos;s all .
are you sure ?
o @-@ of course .
you know , if you wanna be helpful , just , um ,
go get me a glass of water so ...
so i can take my pill .
yeah , okay .
hey , max , it &apos;s serena .
listen , i have to take a rain check .
my cousin and i have a lot to do before the party .
if you ever find yourself sick with saturday night fever ,
the last thing you want is for someone to turn up the heat .
oh , my gosh !
max , that &apos;s beautiful !
i had the ingredients .
i hope your grandmother enjoys it .
now i &apos;m going to leave before you think i &apos;m a stalker
who shows up for canceled dates .
no , stop it . i don &apos;t . i really did want to see you .
i just--i didn &apos;t wanna move too fast .
no , i get it .
24 hours with a guy you just met
is more than enough .
to be honest ,
i thought maybe you weren &apos;t quite over your ex yet .
when we met , you--you were still looking for her .
just to return her stuff .
i haven &apos;t thought about ivy since we met , serena .
i swear .
well , how would you like to come with me to studio 54 tonight
and present the cake to my grandmother yourself ?
you do realize you just went from &quot; let &apos;s take it slow &quot;
to &quot; want to meet my family ? &quot; right ?
caution is not my strong suit .
well , how about we try something in between ?
uh , you liveblog with party updates ,
and i &apos;ll pick you up tomorrow afternoon .
that sound perfect .
thank you .
no , thank you .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to call a doctor ?
oh , yes , no .
i just need some rest , and , you know , the jet lag ,
and of course i didn &apos;t eat anything this morning .
that &apos;s ginger tea .
i knew someone who took those pills .
the ginger helps with the dizziness .
tell me .
what does your mother want your money for ?
be honest , charlotte .
i &apos;m not gonna let her bully you .
it wasn &apos;t her .
it &apos;s me that wants the apartment .
she was just trying to help
to make it seem like it was her idea .
well , i wish you &apos;d just been honest .
although growing up with carol ,
i mean , how would you know better ?
you &apos;ve been so generous .
i didn &apos;t wanna ask for more .
well , now that you have ,
i will uncap my waterman
and release the funds tomorrow morning .
thank you !
listen , i &apos;m sorry i had to be the one to tell you .
yeah , i doubt that .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re enjoying every second of this .
i know our history isn &apos;t exactly pristine , tripp ,
but we &apos;re still family .
god , with her sailing instructor ? really ?
i should have known when she kept asking to leave
grandfather &apos;s compound a week early .
and you were there all of august , right ?
yeah .
it &apos;s funny .
usually she complains about having to go back to d.c.
look , man , we really worked on our marriage
after the whole serena situation .
i just thought we were on the right track .
i &apos;m sorry .
look , i get you have to run the story .
just ... i hope you don &apos;t let your personal feelings
against me make it any uglier than it has to be .
thanks for telling me .
i guess now we &apos;re even .
hey , grandfather , it &apos;s nate .
i &apos;m gonna wait on that story .
i think maureen &apos;s lying about the affair .
i just don &apos;t know why .
next one over .
uh , excuse me , sir ?
do you know who lives here ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not a stalker .
in fact , the person i &apos;m looking for is the stalker--
an anonymous one , the worst kind .
no ?
dan ?
alessandra ? what are you doing here ?
i live here .
isn &apos;t that why you buzzed my apartment ?
that &apos;s usually how it works .
no , actually , i was looking for someone who hates me .
chuck ?
are you sure you &apos;re comfortable with blair here ?
i don &apos;t believe i have a choice ,
which is why i &apos;m controlling the information .
which , thus far , has been a bunch of monkey business .
i &apos;m worried his licking himself is anxiety ,
that he &apos;s lonely .
enough .
assuming this is a 50 @-@ minute session ,
i only have 18 minutes left to get my answers .
and what is it you &apos;re searching for , blair ?
nice try on the bait and switch ,
but i was a teenage bulimic ,
and my father came out when i was 15 .
this isn &apos;t my first analysis .
what i need for you is to show me
how you helped chuck transform .
i told you , blair .
there is no one answer .
there isn &apos;t one , or you don &apos;t want to give it to me
because you don &apos;t want me to fix louis ?
are you saying that you want your fiance
to be more like chuck ?
no ! more like the man chuck &apos;s become ,
like louis used to be
when chuck was like louis is now .
if you don &apos;t mind me saying so ,
you seem confused .
only by chuck &apos;s refusal to disclose .
if he really is a good person ,
why doesn &apos;t he tell me how he got that way ?
obviously , he hasn &apos;t really let go ,
or he would give me the information i need .
you mean let go of the intimacy between you ?
you said it , not me , and you &apos;re the expert .
but i did let go of you , blair .
then prove it by telling me how .
i can &apos;t .
but if you don &apos;t believe me ,
call on harry winston .
the night of &quot; the spectator &quot; launch ,
i left the engagement ring i bought you on their doorstep
and walked away .
i forgot ...
i , uh ...
i ... have a cake tasting to attend .
you blow cheryl ladd out of the water .
oh , thank you , my darling . too bad carol &apos;s arrival
has put a pall over the entire evening .
well , hopefully we can get her to dance the night away
and hustle her the hell out of here .
it is taking every ounce of self @-@ control
not to march over and tell her what a terrible mother
i think she is .
she heard you loud and clear .
come on , lil .
say what you really think for a change .
okay , i &apos;ll let you two talk alone .
last month you were happy to see me
and take care of my daughter .
what could i have done to mortally offend you
all the way from florida ?
charlie told me you made her live
under the name of &quot; ivy dickens . &quot;
as if being a teenager isn &apos;t enough of an identify crisis
without having to assume a false one .
how dare you .
you know nothing about charlie or our relationship .
i know you put your hatred of our family
above her well @-@ being .
what else is there ?
i assure you that being ivy
is the only thing that saved charlie
from the despicable fate of being a rhodes .
hey , max , it &apos;s serena .
so it turns out the party tonight was canceled ,
and i have my mom &apos;s apartment all to myself
if you wanna come celebrate being over ivy with me .
we do have cake , after all .
7 o &apos;colock . don &apos;t be late .
chaka khan might have been every woman ,
but looks like charlie rhodes is about to have trouble
being two .
i wish you wouldn &apos;t take it as a negative .
it &apos;s called &quot; i hate humphrey . &quot;
yeah , to get people talking about you and your book .
sugar and spice and everything nice get no attention .
sex taps and public brawls make people famous .
i &apos;m not--i &apos;m not snooki . i &apos;m a writer .
who skipped out on his book tour .
my career &apos;s on the line here , too .
i took a chance on a young , inexperienced author .
i was trying to get you back on the radar .
i knew you wouldn &apos;t like the method ,
but if it makes you feel better ,
there &apos;s a twitter called &quot; humphrey love , &quot; too .
that &apos;s me .
oh . sorry .
i should &apos;ve recognized your scalpel @-@ sharp
self @-@ deprecation .
well , i have over a thousand followers .
yeah . let &apos;s hope they bought books .
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt your feelings .
i &apos;ll close the account .
no . i have a better idea .
when tripp told me he and maureen were with you
all of august ,
something didn &apos;t feel right .
that &apos;s when one of my reporters said
she was spotted with her sailing instructor .
she could have snuck down to d.c.
for a night or two , i &apos;d imagine .
which is why i called the club .
turns out the only sailing lessons maureen ever took
were from a woman named heather two years ago .
are you saying ...
maureen &apos;s faking an affair ? yeah .
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time she &apos;s faked something .
think of what it would do to tripp .
it would hurt him immeasurably .
or help him . tripp just hired a new campaign manager
to explore running for governor .
the last time he needed help in the polls ,
maureen hired someone to jump in the hudson
so tripp could look like a hero .
so now she &apos;s making him into a victim ?
it seems like a risky move .
oh , well , think about it .
a politician out there fighting for the good in washington ,
while his wife steps out on him at the yacht club ?
it &apos;s a sympathetic story .
i can &apos;t believe that maureen would risk her marriage .
oh , she &apos;d make a public apology and go to counseling ,
convince him it &apos;d be better for his career to stay together ,
and in two years , when his name &apos;s on that ballot ,
people will remember him as a guy
who fought through a rough patch to save his family .
it &apos;s pretty shrewd .
at least you won &apos;t have to run the story of her affair .
no , i &apos;ll just run this one instead .
i understand you &apos;re , um , upset by maureen &apos;s manipulations ,
but tripp was completely in the dark
about her antics with that river rescue .
i &apos;m sure this is the same now .
oh , this is not a story . this is a family squabble .
that could &apos; cause your cousin his career .
i &apos;ll do the right thing . don &apos;t worry .
i have no idea . they &apos;re all so delicious .
i agree . every morsel is like taste of heaven .
but you must choose top three choices
before sylvia weinstock , queen of cake , arrives .
how can i choose my wedding cake
when my groom has lost his sweetness ?
peeing in fountain was not answer ?
stop mentioning that ,
or i &apos;ll never be able to toss a coin in again ,
and i need all the wishes i can get .
i get us some milk .
so much cake make baby kick up storm .
what are you doing here ?
why did you walk out of therapy ?
you weren &apos;t going to reveal your secrets ,
and i have cakes to taste , so if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i haven &apos;t even begun the buttercream .
dr. krueger thought you were upset i returned the ring .
he has too many phds .
they cancel each other out and make him a moron .
i returned it because you asked me to let you go .
i wanted to move on
to give you the happy life you deserve .
all this time , i &apos;ve blamed you
for pulling me into the dark .
but i was wrong .
it was me who brought out your dark side .
and now that i &apos;m with louis ,
i &apos;ve done the same to him .
i &apos;m sorry .
these glasses of champagne used to be served
with a white lady appetizer .
uh , mother , since we have a little time before the party ,
rufus and i have a small gift for you .
opening night . i tracked it down for you .
how surprisingly thoughtful .
if i had any memory of that night ,
i &apos;m sure it would be fond .
her favoritism is nauseating .
now is not the time to be mad at cece .
all she has to do is sign a paper tomorrow ,
and we &apos;re in the clear .
you &apos;re a better actress than i thought .
you got more out of her in three minutes
than i have in 45 years .
i was just kind to her . maybe you should try it .
she is getting older .
and meaner .
you don &apos;t know these people .
they &apos;re my family , not yours .
remember that .
of course .
sorry .
... get me out of the dress .
mom !
mother , let me see !
goodness .
oh , your body looks amazing .
max .
what are you doing here ?
serena said to meet her here , said the party was canceled .
well , it &apos;s not . if lily sees you here ,
everything will be ruined .
i see you two have found each other .
no need for introductions , right , max and ... ivy ?
serena , this isn &apos;t what it looks like .
oh , so you two didn &apos;t used to date ?
we did .
and you didn &apos;t pretend like you &apos;ve never met ?
we did .
and you didn &apos;t try to convince me not to see him again
because he may still be hung up on his ex , ivy ?
uh , girls , this is not the time .
we need to get to grandma &apos;s party .
max , nice to see you again .
wait . you know him , too ? this is insane .
i &apos;m not going anywhere until charlie &apos;s alter ego ,
who everyone seems to know about but me ,
explains what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s not her fault .
carol had her live as ivy
because she hated being a rhodes .
you can &apos;t blame charlie for her own mother &apos;s insanity .
my insanity ?
is this how you get along for mom &apos;s sake ?
what &apos;s for my sake ?
i just want the truth , charlie .
i invited you back to new york .
my mom and rufus gave you somewhere to live .
cece got you your trust fund back . now just stop lying
and tell me what you and your boyfriend are up to .
just when things are about to hit the fan ,
they hit the ground instead with a thud .
mother . mother ?
her pulse feels okay .
okay , give me your jacket . i &apos;m gonna put it under her head .
i &apos;ll call an ambulance .
no , please . i &apos;m all right .
no , don &apos;t get up too quickly . you fainted from the stress .
don &apos;t you try and pin this on me . mother , are you all right ?
i will be when you let me off the floor .
okay , let &apos;s get you somewhere more comfortable .
up you go .
okay .
look , you still look pale .
i think we should call dr. sue .
i &apos;m not gonna wait around for some concierge doctor .
we &apos;re gonna take you to the hospital .
okay , let &apos;s get her over here .
i told you , i &apos;m fine .
i know what &apos;s wrong .
yeah , you keep this apartment excessively warm .
just tell them , grandma .
she &apos;s been dieting to fit into her jumpsuit .
a few martinis and glasses of champagne
on an empty stomach , and anyone would pass out .
well , charlotte &apos;s right .
i &apos;m afraid that i let my vanity get the better of me ,
but , um , something delicious to eat will fix me right up .
comfort food--that &apos;s something i &apos;m good at .
so why don &apos;t you go ahead-- ahead of me , darling ?
oh , don &apos;t be silly , mother . we &apos;ll have our own celebration .
once we get grandma something to eat
and make sure she &apos;s okay ,
charlie can get back to telling us everything .
thanks .
it &apos;s so nice working for someone who means what he says .
yeah . well , let &apos;s , uh ...
let &apos;s hope everyone feels the same way .
&quot; we at &apos; the spectator &apos; are the voice of honesty ,
not the wealthy or politically connected .
recently a family member tried to manipulate our site
for personal and political gain .
we &apos;re not going to name names .
we &apos;re not going to post the story or bury it ,
but instead we &apos;re coming to you with the promise
that we will never let money , power , or personal agendas
get in the way of reporting the truth . &quot;
told you i &apos;d do the right thing .
i &apos;m sorry if we have different versions of what that is .
i &apos;m not here to reprimand you .
you remind me of myself when i was your age .
wait . you &apos;re not angry that i alluded to maureen ?
you &apos;re your own man , nathaniel .
i &apos;ve always loved you .
but now ... well , i respect you , too .
you never pulled me to the dark side , blair .
i appreciate you trying to make me feel better ,
but i have my answer .
you were the lightest thing that ever came into my life .
then ... why did it take letting me go
to find this whole new side of yourself ?
i only turned dark and desperate
because i was afraid of losing you .
your love kept me alive .
but you survived without me .
the worst thing happened ,
and i didn &apos;t die .
but i had to find a new way to move on with my life .
i only want you to be happy .
i &apos;m just sorry it couldn &apos;t be with me .
oh , blair , there you are .
i brought some more samples with me .
i see the groom is here , too .
i &apos;m not the groom .
when i saw you in l.a. ,
i lied and didn &apos;t tell you that max was my boyfriend
or that i was living under the name ivy dickens .
who &apos;s ivy dickens ?
i &apos;m sorry , mother . that was my fault .
i didn &apos;t want anyone to find out that she was a rhodes
and use her for her money ,
which is exactly what max is doing .
i &apos;m not the one using you people . she is .
he &apos;s blackmailing me .
is that what you wanted the money for ?
not for an apartment ?
he manipulated me ... into doing things i &apos;m not proud of .
what are you talking about ?
he has a tape that he was threatening to expose .
i was worried he was gonna do the same to you , serena .
that &apos;s why i tried to get you to stop seeing him .
i don &apos;t have a tape .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me the truth ?
i just tried to pay him off , get rid of him .
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe you people are buying this .
she &apos;s scamming you . she is not charlie rhodes .
she &apos;s ivy dickens .
she &apos;s a wannabe actress from florida .
i think we &apos;ve heard enough of your lies .
and you &apos;re not even her real mother .
she grew up in trailer parks .
her father was a heroin addict who died
right in front of her when she was 8 years old .
that &apos;s just what i told him to make him believe i was ivy .
i have proof .
you took it .
enough .
this is my granddaughter , charlie rhodes .
i was there the day she was born . she is my family .
i don &apos;t need any proof .
i know it in my bones .
you should go before we call the police .
just remember ...
i warned all of you .
sister sledge sang &quot; we are family , &quot;
but she had nothing on the rhodes girls .
i &apos;m sorry ... again .
i should have had enough faith in our friendship
to be able to tell you the truth .
no , it &apos;s okay , but i do see why you fell for max .
i mean , he seemed perfect .
too bad he was just seeing me to get to you .
you &apos;ll find someone great .
mm , i hope so . but at least max left his cake .
i think i &apos;m gonna get some more champagne .
can i , uh , interrupt your slide ?
yeah , you know , i think i &apos;ll go find an extra fondue set .
i &apos;m sorry about changing charlie &apos;s name .
it took mom fainting for me to realize
why you were so upset about it .
i just want us all to be rhodes for as long as we have left .
me too .
it &apos;s just another example of my overprotective parenting
getting the best of me .
i may have been a little quick to judge again ,
but it &apos;s only because i &apos;ve come to love charlie
as if she were my own .
great . now she &apos;ll have two moms to screw her up .
oh , i love this song .
thank you for discretion earlier .
no problem .
but , um ...
you know , if you &apos;re really sick ,
i think you should tell the family .
they might care more than you think .
perhaps . but i appreciate you protecting my secret .
we all have them . it &apos;s a rhodes family tradition .
that &apos;s not nearly mean enough . here , let &apos;s switch .
i &apos;ll be hate . you be love .
&quot; talk about by @-@ the @-@ numbers .
humphrey &apos;s more hardy boy than hemingway . &quot;
impressive .
i &apos;ve been at this a while .
oh . oh , my god .
katy perry just retweeted us .
what ? she &apos;s--she &apos;s got like 9 million followers .
those are best @-@ seller numbers .
you went full jerry maguire ,
and your family approved .
sounds like a successful editorial to me .
i must say , being in control felt pretty damn good ...
as will losing it .
how was your day with blair ?
did you teach her how to turn louis around ?
i told her the truth .
the whole truth ?
you should work for &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i just wish i had the courage to do it sooner .
i &apos;ve finally become the man she wanted ,
and she &apos;s already chosen another one .
i &apos;m too late .
you still love her , huh ?
i can &apos;t imagine the day i won &apos;t .
long after the clubs have closed ,
disco inferno rages on .
for some , it &apos;s burning desire that keeps them awake at night .
miss blair ,
if you finally find key to bring mr. louis back to castle ,
why you not look like perky self ?
just tell him he will not lose you ,
and he will be prince again .
i can find time difference so you can call him
in third world country .
no . i need to rest .
all that wedding cake made me sick .
you &apos;re dismissed .
for others , it &apos;s the flames of uncertainty that plague them .
looks like we &apos;re finally in the clear .
you can leave anytime you want .
would it be okay with you if i stay ?
you have enough money .
you could set yourself up anywhere in the world .
it &apos;s not about the money for me .
in fact , you can have all of it .
then ...
what do you want ?
a family .
i &apos;m sorry . i never knew
that you &apos;d had such a troubled upbringing .
i swiped this when max took off his jacket .
i &apos;ll make sure no one ever sees this .
thanks .
well , if they ever found out the truth
about the real charlotte rhodes ,
they would never forgive me .
this way , we both get to keep our family .
what do you want ?
my life back-- the move to los angeles ,
the job i gave up with boulud ,
the two years i spent believing you and loving you
when all you did was lie and cheat
so you could have some fancy life that isn &apos;t yours .
you better watch your back , because i am not leaving town
until i get what i deserve .
good luck with that .
no one touch me anymore .
i &apos;m a rhodes now .
if you &apos;re going to play with matches ,
make sure you don &apos;t leave them around
to spark the flame anew .
disco isn &apos;t actually dead ,
and neither am i.
