okay , hold on a second .
hold on a second . hol ...
hey , hey , she &apos;s doing it , she &apos;s doing it !
yesha , yesha , you &apos;re standing , baby .
she &apos;s standing up ! hurry , get in here !
look at daddy , look at daddy , look at daddy .
ah ! i got you .
first day of school , ready to conquer the universe .
yes , indeed , look at my baby .
my baby girl , yesha dargis .
yes ! give daddy a wave .
yeah , baby .
that &apos;s good .
&quot; after passing the medical college admission test ,
&quot; i will need four more years of education ,
and i intend to go to stanford school of medicine . &quot;
but nobody will love me , dad .
not with these stupid braces .
hey . come here .
everyone ... will love you , honey ,
because you are the most beautiful girl
in the world .
wow .
hold on , baby . look at my little girl
growing up . her first prom .
look at you ! you look ... you look gorgeous .
absolutely stunning .
you look good , too , young man . you look good .
okay , dad , can we go now ?
all right , hold on . need a ...
need a picture , please .
all right , got you .
all right , you guys .
what , i don &apos;t get no love ?
all right . i love you .
love you , too .
did you want a son , dad , not a daughter ?
no . why would you ask me that ?
i don &apos;t know . boys seem less complicated .
what &apos;s that ?
next door .
they &apos;re having some problems .
i think he &apos;s selling drugs or something .
yesha , get down !
get down , yesha !
gina , call 911 !
yesha , no , no , no , no . no , no , no , no .
dad . dad , dad , dad .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
dad , dad .
dad . dad ...
i sympathize with mr. dargis .
everyone in this courtroom sympathizes with a father
who loses his daughter ,
but this billboard he put up
is intended to maliciously harm my client &apos;s business .
no . my client &apos;s intent is simply to ensure
that those ultimately responsible
for his daughter &apos;s death
are held accountable in the court of public opinion ,
since the protection
of lawful commerce in arms act
precludes them from being held accountable
in a court of law .
forgive me , is there
a noun missing ?
gloria &apos;s is the noun , your honor .
gloria &apos;s guns is the gun shop that sold
the semiautomatic handgun used to murder our client &apos;s daughter .
ah . my condolences , sir .
and the billboard is protected under the first amendment .
no .
it &apos;s defamatory , and we want it taken down .
can you ...
show damages ?
i &apos;ve owned gloria &apos;s guns for 11 years .
i took it over from my dad when he passed .
and did your store
murder yesha dargis ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
my brother died after he got back from iraq .
i know what it &apos;s like to lose a loved one .
but no .
have you or your store
ever been prosecuted or even fined in connection
with unlawful gun sales ?
no .
and has this billboard had an impact on your business ?
it has . there are protesters outside of my shop every day ,
trying their best to shut me down .
are you aware that , in the past five years ,
over 3,000 guns used in crimes
have been traced back to your store ?
i &apos;ve heard that number .
but it &apos;s not the shop .
it &apos;s the neighborhood i &apos;m in .
would i rather move to a better neighborhood ?
yes , but i can &apos;t afford the rent .
aren &apos;t there a lot of people who shop at gloria &apos;s guns
because you have a reputation of turning a blind eye
to straw buyers ?
objection . argumentative .
assumes facts not in evidence .
yes , sustained . although 3,000 guns
from your shop , that &apos;s ... stunning .
your honor , we know you &apos;re pro @-@ gun control .
no . i am impartial here .
w @-@ we know you have ...
your honor , this is
the fourth time ms. hoff has tried
to influence your impartiality .
what ? no . i &apos;m trying to insist on your impartiality .
come on . &quot; we know you are pro @-@ gun control &quot; ?
where is there one iota of untruth in that ?
okay , no .
thank you . my impartiality is my own concern .
but thank you . now ,
even if there were 3,000 gun deaths associated with these guns ,
how is the billboard not defamatory ?
your honor ,
truth is an absolute defense against defamation .
you &apos;re submitting that the statement on the billboard
is actual truth ?
your honor ,
if i may have a moment .
yes . please .
i thought we decided to argue opinion .
it gives us more flexibility .
truth is stronger . and abernathy wants to be on our side .
well , then ... ask for a recess .
we need jason to pivot .
geez .
it &apos;s diane .
you &apos;re on your lunch break .
hi , diane . how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
all right , when ?
i thought we were going for opinion .
got it . diane , can you hold on for one second ?
grow up .
go .
hey , eli . what &apos;s up ?
all right , i &apos;ll go by gloria &apos;s . what do you think you need ?
i don &apos;t know . um ...
there have been no citations or convictions for wrongdoing .
this afternoon , i guess ?
that much i know . but , no ,
let me dig deeper into the straw buyer angle .
i &apos;ll come by this afternoon , okay ?
wait , what ?
who else is testifying ?
lloyd garber .
peter &apos;s donor ? that can &apos;t be good .
what can he say ?
well , that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna try and find out .
do you still have that way to find it out ?
yes .
so what do you need from me ?
the prosecutor &apos;s gonna force you to invoke privilege .
seriously ?
yeah . we tried to negotiate a nonappearance ,
but he wouldn &apos;t bite , so ...
uh , hold on . hold on .
uh , tell her what you want .
can you ...
there you go .
mrs. florrick ,
how are you doing ?
i &apos;m good . so he wants to drag me
in front of the grand jury ?
yes . to my mind , it &apos;s a strategic mistake .
he &apos;ll look like a bully asking you over and over to invoke
spousal privilege . i urge you not to get angry .
don &apos;t show any impatience . smile .
that &apos;s ... okay . i got it , mike . i &apos;ll be fine .
can i hear it from you just once ?
on advice of counsel , i invoke
my spousal privilege not ... could you hold on for a minute ?
... to answer any of your questions .
good . that sounded good .
like you &apos;re somewhere else .
thank you . uh , mike , that &apos;s my call waiting .
i have to get it .
oh , come on .
grace . hi . did you find out ?
well , maybe it &apos;s a deferred admittance .
college .
did you check the web site ?
no , that &apos;s the thing . mr. ecklund ,
my guidance counselor , he called their admissions office .
mom , the admissions office thinks that i plagiarized my essay .
what ? !
you are peter florrick &apos;s largest financial supporter .
you &apos;ve given mr. florrick and his campaign
over a million dollars .
i was happy to do it .
i &apos;m sure .
when peter florrick was state &apos;s attorney ,
did you ever ask him to intervene in the murder trial
of your son , richard locke ?
i want to be clear : that has nothing to do
with why i supported peter florrick in the first place .
i believed in his candidacy .
of course , mr. garber . that &apos;s understood .
but things changed when your son
was charged with murder , didn &apos;t they ?
richie was facing murder charges .
i told peter i didn &apos;t want my son going to jail .
and what did mr. florrick say ?
he said , &quot; you have nothing to worry about . &quot;
we were sitting in his office , and peter looked me in the eye
and said , &quot; lloyd , you know how much
&quot; i count on your support .
you have nothing to worry about . &quot;
and you took this to mean ...
peter was going to protect richard .
and he did .
by engineering a mistrial .
seriously ?
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
i said , &quot; seriously ? &quot;
it just seems pretty convenient ,
florrick admitting exactly what you need him to .
mr. garber is giving
sworn testimony .
that he practiced .
but see if he remembers anything else that clearly .
what did you have for lunch last tuesday ?
uh , you @-@ you don &apos;t have to answer that , mr. garber .
you said we could ask anything we want .
yes . anything relevant , sir .
why isn &apos;t this relevant ?
we &apos;ve been listening to all your questioning .
now i have a question .
okay . wait , okay !
yes .
it &apos;s a legitimate question .
thank you ,
mr. meade .
it &apos;s time to take a break .
let &apos;s all reconvene in one hour .
oh , my god .
genuine thought is a database with millions of essays .
it helps schools identify possible plagiarism .
mr. ecklund , have you read grace &apos;s essay ?
i have .
so then you know that this is intensely personal .
do you seriously think that other essays
in that database contain the same family history ?
mrs. florrick , many students write about the challenges
they &apos;ve overcome . and while the specific facts may be unique ,
the lessons that applicants say
they &apos;ve learned from them aren &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t plagiarize .
mr. ecklund , could you tell us exactly what grace is being
accused of plagiarizing ?
i can &apos;t say .
we @-@ we weren &apos;t given that information .
well , who was given that information ?
college admissions .
i &apos;d like to speak to them .
i &apos;m not getting into college .
yes , you are .
how ?
software .
it makes mistakes .
it was a fight next door .
um , over drugs .
they shot at each other , and ...
... and one bullet hit my daughter .
what happened to the man who shot her ?
he &apos;s in jail . they caught him on security video .
and why do you blame gloria &apos;s guns ?
the gun used to kill my daughter ,
it was traced back to her shop .
she sold it to a straw buyer .
and what does that mean , &quot; straw buyer &quot; ?
someone who buys a gun
and then they sell it to another person
who couldn &apos;t have bought it .
who wouldn &apos;t have passed a background check .
and it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s illegal and they do it all the time .
the cops don &apos;t stop &apos; em , the feds don &apos;t stop &apos; em ...
i want to stop &apos; em .
i don &apos;t blame you , sir .
thank you , harry .
i am deeply sorry for your loss , mr. dargis .
what was the name of the man who shot your daughter ?
antoine devlin .
no further questions .
your honor , the billboard states
&quot; gloria &apos;s murdered my daughter . &quot;
and yet mr. dargis himself
has just acknowledged that that isn &apos;t true .
in fact , the person that gloria &apos;s sold the gun to
didn &apos;t even do it .
you &apos;re saying the causal connection was broken .
not just me .
the justice system has determined
who murdered yesha dargis .
he &apos;s behind bars .
uh , your honor , the statement on the billboard
is defensible in a defamation action as opinion .
those aren &apos;t two different defenses ;
those are two conflicting defenses .
i &apos;m afraid i have to agree with you .
although mr. dargis has my sympathies ,
he didn &apos;t put up a billboard saying
that &quot; gloria &apos;s outrageous business practices &quot;
led to his daughter &apos;s death .
the billboard , as is ,
is defamatory and must come down .
and then there &apos;s the matter of damages .
your honor ,
may i point out the perversity
of a victim of gun violence
being forced to pay
while the seller of the gun profits ?
you may .
please return with your arguments
as to a damage amount .
that was a mistake .
we should have kept arguing for &quot; opinion . &quot;
and it would have had the same result .
you &apos;re late .
i have a life .
what &apos;s wrong ?
we &apos;re changing strategy for your grand jury deposition .
okay .
without pressing mr. gold
to share how he has acquired this knowledge ,
he believes there is one grand jury member
who is incredulous about the prosecutor &apos;s case .
now , that of course is not enough to head off an indictment--
we need 12 jurors to vote a no bill .
but where there is one ,
others may follow .
so you want me not to invoke spousal privilege ?
this juror thinks lloyd garber is lying ,
that he could never remember a damning conversation with peter .
so you want me to try to talk to this juror &apos;s doubts without ...
seeming to ?
yes .
any thoughts on how to do that ?
no idea .
okay .
let &apos;s go for it .
oh , why so down ?
turn that frown upside down .
go to hell . you &apos;re very cheerful .
i &apos;m liking it here .
i need an office .
this is crazy .
take that one .
i can &apos;t just take an office .
sure you can .
you &apos;re gonna get me fired .
what &apos;s going on ?
we want to steal an office .
i thought you were out grand jurying .
tomorrow . they delayed it .
uh , what do you mean , steal an office ?
i told her she should take that one .
well , whose is it ?
lucca &apos;s .
no . no one &apos;s .
lucca quinn .
okay . on my way up .
the gun shop bookkeeping .
don &apos;t move me .
she &apos;s not happy , is she ?
not much .
we came in as peers , and i get the office ,
she gets the cubicle .
right .
i need to hire you freelance .
is this another subject ?
yes .
it &apos;s something personal .
your husband ?
no , my daughter .
oh , my god .
my family needs a full @-@ time investigator--
that &apos;s not normal , is it ?
sure it is .
what &apos;s the issue ?
have you ever heard of a software called genuinethought.com ?
her business is up almost 20 % year to date .
so good , there are no damages .
she &apos;ll say her business would be up even more--
gun business is booming .
i agree-- they &apos;re trying to make an example out of this .
take on the gun industry
and we &apos;ll make you pay .
i wish i could sue for how much money i &apos;ve lost on my business .
what do you mean ?
my motel .
every time there &apos;s a new story about the gun violence ,
i lose reservations .
well , why can &apos;t you try to recover ?
no . the protection of lawful commerce in arms act is the problem--
it makes it impossible to recover against anyone in the gun industry .
no one has tried civil claims tied to tourism .
so , y ... i &apos;m sorry , what ?
we are countersuing for damages , your honor .
really ? how does that work ?
your honor , did you want to know how that works ?
i do , thank you .
the plaintiff here can &apos;t show losses .
we &apos;ve gone through her books twice .
but our client can .
mr. dargis owns a motel in the neighborhood ,
and his losses are directly related to the increase in gun violence .
excuse me , but congress has made this kind of lawsuit impossible .
the protection of lawful commerce ...
plcaa contains exceptions , one of which
is the predicate statute exception .
if gloria &apos;s guns &apos; activities violated another existing law ,
her immunity is stripped .
and what statute did she violate ?
the illinois promotion act .
what is that ?
an act of the legislature promoting tourism .
20 ilcs 665 declares that
the state must increase the economic impact
of tourism throughout the state .
this is a joke .
no , this is a law .
gloria &apos;s sale of thousands of crime guns undermines tourism ,
and our client has a tourism business that is suffering .
your honor , the federal courts have ruled that the statute
must be directly applicable to firearms .
not all . and circuit splits are exactly
what bubbles up to the supreme court .
illinois needs its own guidance on this issue .
okay ! you had me at supreme court .
counselors , let &apos;s make some law .
come on back with your arguments ,
and we &apos;ll contend .
good day in court ?
uh , yes , actually .
you &apos;re not drinking ?
i &apos;m trying to go easier .
well ... to going easier .
have you , uh , given it more thought ?
an all @-@ female firm ?
all female name partners .
i don &apos;t want to hurt cary .
well , you won &apos;t be doing anything .
i will offer to buy him out .
but what if he doesn &apos;t want to be bought out ?
then we &apos;ll talk .
i wouldn &apos;t be doing this
if cary and david lee weren &apos;t already making moves against me .
i just want to know where you &apos;ll land .
i &apos;m asking you to land with me .
lucca quinn isn &apos;t happy .
she &apos;s downstairs , in a cubicle , being given grunt work
when i think she is one of the smartest lawyers in the firm .
you &apos;re asking me to promote her ?
i want to be at a firm that recognizes talent .
all right , let me take another look .
uh , would you excuse me for just ... just a minute .
why don &apos;t you call him .
maybe it was just a friend .
or ... an old flame or ...
i don &apos;t know .
why does it even matter ?
you &apos;re the one drinking .
maybe it doesn &apos;t .
i mean , i didn &apos;t want to ... marry him .
i don &apos;t want to ... tie him down .
and you &apos;re married .
i have issues on this front .
husbands who screw around ,
who lie , who leave me in tears .
you &apos;re not in tears now .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not .
that &apos;s a sign of growth , right ?
or something .
scar tissue .
maturity .
cynicism .
you expect the worst in people ,
you &apos;ll never be disappointed .
right .
you think this is the worst of jason ?
no . i didn &apos;t say that .
he didn &apos;t promise you anything , right ?
he didn &apos;t , did he ?
no , but i was becoming ...
invested .
i liked it .
i liked being with him .
so why can &apos;t you keep it up ?
become another face in his harem ?
have fun .
start your own harem .
when you stop having fun , say good @-@ bye .
oh , god , this isn &apos;t who i am .
you don &apos;t know who you are .
no one knows who they are .
talk to jason .
he likes you .
and maybe it was just a friend .
so , are we still on for tonight ?
can i ... get back to you on that ?
yeah . sure .
grand jury stuff ?
yes . that , too . right .
all right , so about what i found out .
your daughter .
oh . right .
dear god , i &apos;m falling apart .
all right , genuine thought--
it &apos;s big business in the fight against student plagiarism .
the software designers have acknowledged
they &apos;re having problems with false positives ,
which is why the company has settled a few lawsuits last year .
wait , false positives how ?
it might tag a section as plagiarism when ,
in fact , it &apos;s just a phrase in common usage .
for example , in one paper they flagged :
&quot; there &apos;s not enough money to go around , &quot;
or &quot; according to conventional wisdom &quot;
as plagiarized , when in fact they &apos;re just sort of clichés .
unoriginal , but not plagiarized .
so , what do i do ?
well , you need to find out what they &apos;re saying is plagiarized .
they won &apos;t tell me-- they say it breaks policy .
they don &apos;t want more lawsuits .
okay . great .
thanks . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
hey ...
everything is normal here , right ?
as normal as it can be .
okay , so then we &apos;ll just ...
reschedule lunch .
okay .
hey , um , genuine thought--
they don &apos;t just have contracts with colleges ?
no .
so i could submit something too ?
i &apos;m , uh , handing the harry redirect to lucca .
what ?
why ?
well , she knows the business . and i want to encourage her .
the first weekend of january , 12 people were shot
within five blocks of my motel .
by monday , 75 % of our guests had checked out early .
and eight parties canceled their reservations
the following weekend .
was that atypical ?
no , that &apos;s been the pattern more than the exception .
shootings , check @-@ outs , cancellations .
but why are you blaming gloria &apos;s ?
of the 700 crime guns traced back to gloria last year ,
more than 200 were linked to shootings within a mile of my motel .
thank you , sir . and i &apos;m sorry .
isn &apos;t it true you &apos;ve
received more than 30 one @-@ star bed &amp; plate reviews ?
yeah , but bed &amp; plate is a racket .
that i agree with .
you don &apos;t believe you have &quot; beds the dead would complain about &quot;
or &quot; bathrooms reminiscent of soldier field &quot; ?
i look at the feedback , try to fix any problems that people point out .
but don &apos;t you think it &apos;s conceivable
that those problems are the direct cause
of your drop in business , not gun violence ?
no , the gun violence hurt my business ,
so i had to cut back .
or were you cutting back because you were saving up to buy another motel ?
objection , your honor . foundation .
i &apos;ll sustain that .
i think i &apos;m good here . i &apos;ll rest .
well , we seem to have
a chicken and egg problem here ,
and if you &apos;re trying to prove causation ,
that is not good news .
given that i cannot find enough evidence to definitively rule
that mr. dargis &apos;s business suffered from gun violence specifically ...
your honor ,
before you rule ...
ms. lockhart , i feel like i &apos;ve been more than fair here .
absolutely . uh , but please ,
if you could just grant us a brief recess ,
i believe we can offer you
the definitive proof that you &apos;re looking for .
hotel owners , restaurateurs ,
valet companies , gift shops .
they all say their business is down in the same period ,
by roughly the same amount as harry &apos;s .
they can all show verified losses from gun crimes ?
and i can probably find you a few more
if i have a little time .
no , this is amazing .
perfect . we can use this as a class action .
no , first we use it in this case . even as a test balloon .
jason .
what ?
i can &apos;t just take an office .
i agree .
well , come on , then .
help me move it back .
i didn &apos;t move you there . diane did .
diane .
what ?
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
but congratulations .
thank you .
i need a minute of your time .
sounds serious .
who were you seeing last night at the avenue tavern ?
who was i seeing ?
yes .
a woman . who ?
you know , this seems like a subject
that we don &apos;t usually delve into .
yes , but this is not usual .
how do you know i was with anyone ?
alicia saw you .
what did she see ?
you ... kissing this woman .
it was a friend from new york .
how serious a friend ?
was alicia upset ?
why would she be upset ?
you &apos;re not married , right ? you didn &apos;t commit to her .
does she know that you &apos;re talking to me ?
no .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
mrs. florrick . hello .
thank you so much for being here today .
it &apos;s not by choice , mr. fox . i was subpoenaed .
well , thank you anyway .
i don &apos;t want to make this any more confrontational
than it has to be .
so , please , just have a seat right here .
i have several questions i think the grand jury
would like to hear the answers to , um ,
but i understand that you have a right to invoke spousal privilege .
i do .
good .
i just don &apos;t want the jury to judge you
every time you say &quot; i invoke spousal privilege
and elect not to answer the question . &quot;
thank you .
so , members of the grand jury ,
please refrain from any such judgment .
now i &apos;d like to turn to our first question .
mrs. florrick ,
did your husband ever make a deal with lloyd garber
to have his son released in trade for political contributions ?
no .
uh ... mrs. florrick ,
just to be clear , you answered that question .
yes , i did .
well , if you answer this question ,
you can &apos;t pick and choose when to invoke spousal privilege .
i know .
so ...
you ... you want to answer questions ?
yes . that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
that &apos;s right . game on .
one second .
mrs. florrick , how many times have you met with mr. garber ?
three .
were these social occasions ?
they were .
and do you have any reason to think he would lie
about this deal he made with your husband ?
no .
so , then , he was telling the truth ?
no , i think , uh ,
lloyd garber has a very bad memory .
okay , let &apos;s move on .
actually , i &apos;m not finished .
um , he tends to ...
forget things , and then ...
it &apos;s o @-@ it &apos;s okay , mrs. florrick , we &apos;re moving on .
don &apos;t you want to hear my answer in full
how mr. garber &apos;s faulty memory
could lead to a falsehood ?
no , i &apos;m actually more interested in the fact ...
i want to hear .
yes !
uh , sir , please hold your questions .
i would if you &apos;d let me ask them .
if i could continue , i would probably
be able to satisfy any questions here .
after i &apos;m finished .
so , let &apos;s talk about this mistrial of lloyd garber &apos;s son .
you are aware of it ?
i am .
and how did you become aware of it ?
mr. garber wanted to hire me recently , as a lawyer ,
and he was trying to remember certain facts about it .
he tends to have a selective memory ...
mrs. florrick ...
i &apos;m sorry ,
but don &apos;t you want me to answer these questions ?
mrs. florrick ...
have you ever met with that grand juror outside of this room ?
what ? !
no .
you know that is a federal offense ?
i do .
why don &apos;t you ask me ?
i have never met with her .
you &apos;re playing with fire here , mr. tascioni .
you cannot be approaching grand jurors .
sorry , what ?
it is a criminal offense
to discuss an ongoing case with a grand juror .
oh , i @-@ i d ... a @-@ and i @-@ and i am not .
tom and i have been sitting here quietly , waiting for ...
mrs. florrick to exit .
tom doesn &apos;t like your accusation either .
so , i imagine that went well .
it was interesting .
we could win this ?
we could .
your honor , it &apos;s not just ...
perhaps it &apos;s one of the parties .
uh , ladies first .
it &apos;s not just mr. dargis &apos;s business that has suffered
due to the actions of gloria &apos;s guns .
rather , a wide cross @-@ section
of tourism @-@ related businesses .
these are 17 chicago business owners
who have offered affidavits
swearing that gun violence has harmed tourism .
your honor , may i call one witness
to rebut these affidavits ?
ms. st. jean , you are the chief economist
for the chicago chamber of commerce ?
that &apos;s right .
and you &apos;re familiar with the tourism statistics for our city ?
intimately .
tell us about 2015 .
up 3.4 % over the previous year .
we actually set a new record , topping 50 million visitors .
and the hotel business ?
up over 2014 in occupancy rates
and average daily rates on rooms .
wow , even with the increased gun violence ?
it &apos;s a testament to chicago &apos;s great draw .
let &apos;s talk about the , uh , numbers again , ma &apos;am .
the visitor numbers to chicago .
they seem unusually high .
chicago is popular .
and getting even more popular .
do your visitor numbers
include all traffic through o &apos;hare airport ,
regardless of whether or not
they ever actually set foot in the city ?
you &apos;re aware that o &apos;hare is the city .
it &apos;s in chicago .
well aware . that was not my question .
i want to know if traffic through o &apos;hare
figures into your tourism statistics for chicago .
that &apos;s not something i can confirm or deny .
sure .
i mean , you &apos;re only the chief economist
for chicago &apos;s chamber of commerce .
objection .
withdrawn .
don &apos;t most large cities measure tourism or growth of tourism
based on hotel occupancy rates and rates per day ?
i don &apos;t know what most cities do .
and yet , uh , chicago inflates its numbers
by including people just passing through the airport ,
even if they &apos;re just catching a connecting flight .
objection . that wasn &apos;t her testimony .
counsel is assuming facts not in evidence .
true . uh , sort of . uh ...
sustained .
okay , well ,
the department of commerce &apos;s last report
shows international tourism to chicago
falling by five percent ,
despite the fact that international visitors
to the united states increased by seven percent .
i would have to check that .
do you think that might have something to do with
how many more shootings have occurred between now and then ?
the similarities were far from vague , mrs. florrick .
then tell us what they are .
what is my daughter accused of plagiarizing ?
unfortunately , it is our college policy
to not reveal the details of these decisions .
you &apos;re worried about a lawsuit ?
we &apos;re worried about confidentiality .
i &apos;m a lawyer , ma &apos;am .
if there &apos;s anyone you should be worried about , it &apos;s a lawyer .
and if there &apos;s anyone you should worry about not intimidating ,
it &apos;s a college admissions director .
well , good . i think that settles the matter .
so here &apos;s the thing . we submitted my grace &apos;s essay
independently , to genuine thought ,
to find out what they considered plagiarism ,
and do you know what they flagged ?
&quot; do not take an oath by your head ,
for you cannot make one hair white or black . &quot;
again , i can not tell you .
it &apos;s from the sermon on the mount .
you &apos;re accusing my daughter of plagiarizing
the sermon on the ... mount .
i can not confirm or deny .
do you seriously want to be sued for denying
my daughter admittance because you can &apos;t tell the difference
between the sermon on the mount within or without quotes ?
it was very nice meeting you , ma &apos;am .
well , i think we should leave it at that .
oh , like hell .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve been called back to the grand jury ,
but i assume you know that .
i hadn &apos;t heard anything .
alicia thought she &apos;d answered all the questions .
well , they had more .
mr. garber , we &apos;re ready .
that &apos;s not a good sign .
no .
i &apos;ll be right back .
it &apos;s unlocked . come on in .
i thought you were lucca .
you want , uh ... you want me to come back ?
no .
i &apos;m eating pizza .
that is the saddest piece of pizza i &apos;ve ever seen .
yes , like charlie brown &apos;s christmas tree .
i &apos;m not even hungry .
so ...
so .
i think ...
i think that i offended you .
yeah .
i met an old friend at avenue tavern .
jason , i &apos;m gonna stop you right there .
i &apos;m an adult .
i know it may not look like it from ...
this pizza ...
but i am .
and i am not under the impression
that we committed to each other , or ...
have expressed ... vows ,
or are going steady , or ...
she &apos;s a friend from new york that i haven &apos;t seen in a while .
seriously , jason , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m here and thrilled that you stopped by ,
and thrilled that we &apos;re talking .
and i do not need some profession of faith .
you don &apos;t need a ticket to get through that door there .
it didn &apos;t mean anything .
you &apos;re still explaining .
i ... am married .
if anyone should be explaining ,
it should be me .
so i ...
i came here with this ... plan .
and now i ...
i don &apos;t know what i should do .
you should come around the island and kiss me .
that &apos;s what this is called ? an island ?
yes . come here .
what if i &apos;m jealous of your husband ?
don &apos;t be .
okay .
my daughter &apos;s home in 45 minutes .
okay , but i can &apos;t lift you .
i threw out my back .
what else do you need , ma &apos;am ?
oh , it &apos;s not about what i need .
you said you cross @-@ referenced grace &apos;s essay with 750,000
other student college essays ?
that is correct , through the genuine thought software .
well , you know the one thing they didn &apos;t do ?
i have no idea , ma &apos;am .
they didn &apos;t acquire the ip rights to those 750,000 essays .
what are you saying ?
they advertised that they had access to these essays .
but unfortunately , you need the intellectual property rights .
and you know what ?
i &apos;m going .
they need the rights .
so you &apos;re subject to suit , too .
and i &apos;m gonna start rounding out a class action suit
to end all class actions suits ,
because you &apos;ve pissed off a lot of essay writers .
um , do @-@ do you ... do you want us to get out of here ?
no .
i think we &apos;re close to a decision , aren &apos;t we , amy ?
you decided it , mom .
i decided what ?
the law .
it &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
okay . please .
i am appalled by the escalation
of gun violence in this city ,
and i agree with the plaintiff
that the plcaa is too far @-@ reaching .
were i a senator or a congressman ,
i would strive to repeal it .
but i am ... a judge .
and it is my job to rule according to the laws we have ,
not the laws i wish we had .
i &apos;m sorry .
although plaintiff &apos;s argument was admirable ,
i find you were unable to make a direct causal connection
between gun sales by gloria &apos;s guns
and a reduction in tourism
that affected damage to any particular business .
your honor , we intend to appeal .
do you mind if i finish first ?
i find for the defense .
no damages are due mr. dargis .
i &apos;m sorry , sir . i sympathize , but the law is the law .
i award damages to gloria &apos;s guns .
i believe that their business was adversely impacted
by this billboard .
i order that the sign be taken down ,
and for every day that the sign is not taken down ,
mr. dargis will pay to gloria &apos;s guns
a cash penalty of ten cents .
excuse me ?
do you understand what i &apos;m saying , mr. dargis ?
if you want to keep your billboard up , you must pay
this court ten cents for every single day .
your honor , that &apos;s offensive .
my client &apos;s business has been affected .
well , yes , and she deserves ten cents for every single day .
your honor , uh , can i pay now ?
if you so wish , sir .
i @-@ i ... i have $ 40 .
okay .
that will give you 400 more days
of your sign being up .
your honor , this invites chaos .
no .
your client has a very profitable business .
she doesn &apos;t want to look at a victim &apos;s face ?
well , that &apos;s too bad .
she &apos;s going to have to .
that &apos;s it .
thank you .
wow . i think your office
has more square footage than mine .
i feel like i &apos;ve arrived .
you look it . put your feet up .
are the associates still hating you ?
let &apos;s see .
hey , bob !
no , they &apos;ve come around .
hey , jason &apos;s coming .
you both all right ?
i think we are .
you talked ?
nice office .
thanks .
we &apos;re gonna go celebrate my promotion . you want to come ?
no . it seems like a girl thing .
we &apos;ll make an allowance .
okay , then , yeah .
alicia ...
hey , cary .
everything all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
pretty fast for an associate to get an office , isn &apos;t it ?
lucca &apos;s good .
seems like yesterday when we were .
so , i have to ask ...
did diane approach you about making this an all @-@ female firm ,
pushing me out ?
did diane ?
yeah .
no , she didn &apos;t .
you two look like you want to be home .
are you kidding ?
no .
i want some chips .
i &apos;ll get &apos; em .
no . no .
you stay .
oh , my god , mrs. florrick , the mouth on you .
it &apos;s one of my best features .
one of your best , not the absolute best .
we are in public .
you are a constant source of surprise .
i wasted the last 20 years .
i &apos;m not gonna waste the next 20 .
it &apos;s on the front page of the sun @-@ times .
the governor &apos;s wife was arrested
for performing a lewd act on an employee .
after the act was described , finally they all agreed ...
