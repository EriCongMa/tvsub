第七季 第九集
the math is all there .
it &apos;s not real .
yes , it is .
yeah ... uh , look .
it is scientifically impossible
for a person to tip a cow .
将其推倒取乐的一种活动
even you , with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders ,
you couldn &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s horrible . why would you push a cow over ?
they &apos;re sacred .
oh , stop it .
i &apos;ve seen you eat , like , a million hamburgers .
hey , an animal can be both sacred and delicious .
look , i &apos;m telling you i &apos;ve done it , okay ?
i clearly remember the cow standing up
and then the cow on its side .
were you drunk ?
i was 16 in nebraska . what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re the one who fell over .
that would explain why the sky was also on its side .
howard . cow tipping : real or not ?
i &apos;m gonna say ... not .
that &apos;s just based on me trying to roll my mom over
when she &apos;s snoring .
speaking of that big side of beef ,
uh , she &apos;s invited all of you to thanksgiving at her house .
you know , i &apos;ve been told that a bald refusal
of an invitation is rude
and one must instead offer up a polite excuse , so ...
i &apos;d love to go , but , unfortunately ,
that sounds awful .
come on , it &apos;ll be fun .
uh , we were actually gonna do it here .
please ? bernadette &apos;s bringing her dad
&apos;cause her mom &apos;s out of town ,
and i never have anything to say to that guy .
oh , since you put it that way , i &apos;d love to go ,
but that sounds even more awful .
it &apos;d actually be nice to not hear
sheldon complain about my cooking all day .
yo ... uh , excuse me ,
but every year you prepare a terrible meal
and every year i criticize it .
do our traditions mean nothing to you ?
i want to go .
yeah , me , too .
i &apos;m in .
sheldon .
ugh , fine , i &apos;ll go .
but if her food is delicious , thanksgiving is ruined ,
and it &apos;s on you .
do we really have to go to mrs. wolowitz &apos;s house ?
we do .
and i expect you to be on your best behavior .
now i know how the african slaves felt .
being dragged from their homes
to labor under the yoke of the white man .
are you honestly comparing
thanksgiving dinner at wolowitz &apos;s mom &apos;s
with one of the greatest tragedies
in the history of mankind ?
yes .
sheldon , you can have a nice thanksgiving anywhere .
i spent one in vegas .
you did ?
yeah , back when i was dating zack .
it was actually more fun than i thought .
we gambled , we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels ,
we had a really good turkey dinner .
which was surprising , since we were at a strip club .
wait , you went to a chapel ?
yeah .
why ?
we had one of those silly fake weddings .
只要新郎新娘两个人说 &quot; 我愿意 &quot; 就可以
penny ...
you know those are real , right ?
no , they &apos;re not .
yeah , they are .
no , they &apos;re not .
yeah , they are .
he &apos;s right .
they &apos;re real .
but it ... didn &apos;t seem real .
let me ask you a question .
at any point , was las vegas on its side ?
hi , dad .
hi , honey .
oh , you brought beer for everybody .
uh , okay , yeah , it &apos;s for everybody .
i really just wanted to have a nice , quiet day at home
and watch the game .
you can have a quiet day and watch the game here .
howard , the medicine &apos;s not working !
you just took it .
at least let it reach your first stomach !
hey , mike .
let me help you out , there .
thanks .
what &apos;s wrong with your mom ?
oh , her gout &apos;s flaring up .
turns out an apple pie a day
does not keep the doctor away .
how can one little toe hurt so bad ?
maybe because that little piggy
is being crushed by the barn !
she should quiet down soon .
i gave her enough pain meds to choke a ...
well , her .
i guess we &apos;re gonna have to do all the cooking .
i have a better idea .
if you think you &apos;re gonna make me do all this by myself ,
you &apos;re crazy .
i was gonna make raj do it all by himself .
oh , well , that &apos;s a great idea .
no traffic , we &apos;re sailing .
yes .
like we &apos;re on a ship .
coming from africa to america .
sheldon , that &apos;s completely inappropriate .
you can &apos;t keep comparing yourself to a slave .
yes , miss amy .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re married to that idiot .
ugh , would you stop ? we just did it as a goof .
well , a goof or not , you &apos;re actually married .
you need to get this taken care of .
i will .
why are you making this such a big deal ?
oh , oh , oh , i have a reason .
it could be because you said yes to marrying zack ,
but every time leonard &apos;s proposed ,
he &apos;s gotten a resounding no .
yeah , that &apos;s just off the top of my head .
so how do i undo this ?
i &apos;m hoping you can get an annulment .
it &apos;s just like it never happened .
great , well , what do i have to do ?
it says here you can get an annulment
if any of the following conditions are met .
&quot; were you unable to consummate the marriage ? &quot;
penny ? next .
&quot; is there any evidence of fraud , bigamy ,
want of understanding ? &quot;
&quot; want of understanding ? &quot; what does that even mean ?
ding , ding , ding . we have a winner .
thanks for saving the day .
ah , no problem .
并感谢印第安人曾在危急的时刻送来食物和帮助他们
it wouldn &apos;t be thanksgiving
without an indian providing the food .
uh , now , where does your mom keep the crisco ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
probably in a wad in her cheek .
i &apos;ll help raj in here .
why don &apos;t you go keep my dad company ?
oh , he doesn &apos;t want me in there .
i &apos;m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter .
don &apos;t be silly , he loves you .
does he ?
okay , he cares about you a lot .
really ?
i do crap for you all the time . get out there .
so your wife &apos;s in arizona with the grandkids ?
you know , my mom &apos;s been to ... arizona .
she rode one of those mules down in the grand canyon .
long story short , they had to shoot it .
&apos;cause she &apos;s so fat .
i &apos;ll get the door while you finish laughing .
hey , guys .
happy thanksgiving .
it smells wonderful .
is anyone slaving away in the kitchen ?
because i , too , know ...
sheldon .
here . thank you for having us .
what &apos;s with you ?
oh , she &apos;s mad at me
because she just found out she &apos;s married to zack .
really ?
that dumb @-@ ass she used to date ?
that &apos;s hysterical .
i can &apos;t believe i felt bad for opening this in the car .
you need any help ?
uh , yeah ,
can you , uh , reach that , uh , gravy boat up there ?
uh , sure .
great .
that makes one of you .
okay , we have a lot to do and not much time to do it .
bernadette , you &apos;re on corn , gravy and yam detail .
amy , you &apos;re on rolls , cranberries
and making sure bernadette stays away from the marshmallows .
that &apos;s right , i see you .
okay , if you have any questions ,
i &apos;ll be over here basting my ass off .
focus is key .
did you guys know penny married zack three years ago ?
what ?
wha ... ?
you ever play football ?
a little in college .
you ?
no .
but i did get tackled in the hallway once .
the whole school cheered .
hey , i found the , uh , court papers
that you and zack need to fill out .
i &apos;ll print them when we get home .
fine .
and we can just put this whole thing behind us .
are you done ?
what ?
look , i get it , i screwed up .
is this all we &apos;re gonna talk about the rest of the day ?
why are you mad at me ?
you &apos;re the one that did the stupid thing .
i &apos;m just trying to fix it .
i need some air .
well ... penny .
now , i don &apos;t know the first thing about women ,
but i would not follow her .
listen to stretch .
how am i the bad guy ?
she &apos;s the one who married someone else . i &apos;m the victim .
sounds like zack &apos;s the victim .
you &apos;re sleeping with his wife .
i &apos;ve kept my marriage together for 35 years .
can i weigh in here ?
sure .
i &apos;m trying to watch the game . shut up .
how do you not make a first down there ?
they passed against a nickel defense .
they should have run it off @-@ tackle .
how the hell do you know that ?
my father loved football .
he always made me watch it
before i was allowed to do my homework .
well , you &apos;ll be happy to know i just spoke to zack
and he &apos;s willing to sign the court papers .
he &apos;s on his way here now .
wait , you invited him here ?
yeah .
i &apos;m getting ready to weigh in again .
come on .
what do you think they ought to do now ?
i would throw a quick slant to a wideout ,
given that the defense is showing blitz .
oh , i love a good blitz ,
especially with sour cream .
get it ?
&apos;cause it sounds like &quot; blintz . &quot;
did someone say &quot; blintz &quot; ? !
i just don &apos;t understand why you invited him here today .
because you wouldn &apos;t shut up about it .
when i called him , he had nothing to do ,
so i just thought it would ...
hey , guys , i &apos;m trying to cook in here .
oh , sorry . we &apos;ll keep it down .
no , no , speak up .
i &apos;m about to use the blender ,
and i don &apos;t want to miss anything .
well , you might have to cook for one more
because she invited zack .
what ?
ooh !
my , my .
the plot , like my gravy , thickens .
i don &apos;t care for your mother &apos;s bathroom .
there &apos;s not an angle to do one &apos;s business
without a clown figurine staring at you .
that &apos;s why i sit .
yeah , that &apos;s why .
you remember the thanksgiving game
when it snowed in dallas ?
1993--
leon lett blew the game in the final seconds
and the dolphins emerged victorious .
then i finally got to do my calculus .
i was so pissed , i wanted to shoot my tv .
so was my dad .
and then he did .
anyone need a beer ? - yeah .
thank god .
so , does your dad still live in texas ?
no . he died when i was 14 .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
so was the man who owned the local liquor store .
he cried and cried .
here you go .
oh , thanks .
so , if your dad died when you were 14,
you were never old enough to have a beer with the man .
no , sir .
he did try to give me one for my high school graduation ,
but i was 11 and my mom said no .
well , you &apos;re having one with me .
all right .
to your dad .
i never had a beer with my dad , either .
do you mind ? we &apos;re having a moment here .
i can &apos;t believe penny &apos;s married to zack .
wonder what she saw in that guy .
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s sweet , he &apos;s tall , handsome .
broad shoulders , good hair .
wonder what she sees in leonard .
how &apos;s it going out there ?
sheldon and your dad are bonding
and completely ignoring me .
i know how you feel .
sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that roomba vacuum .
i kick it when he &apos;s not looking .
what are they doing ?
they &apos;re drinking beer and watching football .
so why don &apos;t do that with them .
they don &apos;t want me .
what do you mean ?
well , sheldon started talking about how his dad isn &apos;t alive anymore ,
and they were toasting , and i tried to tell them about
how sad i was when my dad abandoned ...
zack &apos;s here !
stir the gravy .
sorry . i really want to hear how sad you are .
i &apos;ll be back in like five , ten minutes .
sorry she made you come over here on a holiday .
it &apos;s all right . i didn &apos;t have anything going on .
plus , penny told me we &apos;re married ,
and thanksgiving &apos;s a time to be with family .
yeah , okay , great .
can we just get this over with ?
yeah , uh , you guys have to sign here and here .
on monday , we &apos;ll file for the annulment ,
and this &quot; marriage &quot; will be over .
okay .
i don &apos;t know if i want to sign it .
why won &apos;t you sign it ?
i just think splitting up can be rough on kids .
we don &apos;t have any kids .
are you sure ? &apos; cause you didn &apos;t know
we were married until this morning .
okay , look , zack , come on .
you know neither of us thought this was real .
i mean , we were married by an elvis impersonator .
of course it was an impersonator .
we could never afford a real elvis .
you married him instead of me ?
good call .
sign the papers .
hang on . you know what ?
you have been a jerk about this all day .
you always do this-- whenever i mess up ,
you &apos;re right there to make me feel even worse about it .
that is not true .
yeah , we could &apos;ve waited till monday , signed the papers ,
this all would have been over .
you &apos;re the one who invited him here .
oh , there you go again--
just another mistake you &apos;re throwing in my face .
not cool , bro .
i &apos;m starting to think
you &apos;re not the kind of guy i want dating my wife .
yeah , well ,
she &apos;s not gonna be your wife for long .
oh , no . are you dying ?
i &apos;m about to . sign the paper .
know what they say : &quot; happy wife ,
happy life . &quot;
let &apos;s eat .
two , three , eight , four , six .
that &apos;s all i can do without throwing up .
that is not what i expected
when you said you were gonna burp &quot; pie . &quot;
3 . 14159.26535.89793.23846
did somebody say &quot; pie &quot; ? !
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s scarier :
the bathroom clowns
or the woman that put them there .
all i know is you can only fit one of her in a car .
and there &apos;s the clown that came out of her .
i really didn &apos;t want to come here ,
but this is shaping up to be
one of the best thanksgivings i &apos;ve had in a long time .
me , too .
hey . howie says you &apos;ve been making fun of him all day !
now , both of you apologize right now !
she &apos;s so tiny .
it &apos;s funny when she &apos;s mad .
all right , mister ,
i think you owe howard and bernadette an apology .
perhaps you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry for my behavior .
i &apos;ve had alcohol , and it &apos;s caused me to be inappropriate .
it &apos;s okay .
don &apos;t worry about it .
thank you .
ain &apos;t she great ?
sheldon .
now , how &apos;s about you get us a couple of beers ?
thanks again for cooking .
yeah , everything was delicious .
well , i couldn &apos;t have done it without my two favorite girls .
martha stewart and rachael ray .
hey , sheldon , what do you say we go outside
and throw around the old pigskin ?
this is a jewish house .
i don &apos;t think they have pigskin .
did someone say pigskin !
hey , honey , i &apos;m sorry about today .
and i promise , next time i get married ,
it won &apos;t be a joke .
it &apos;ll be for love .
or money .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
don &apos;t be .
it &apos;s my fault .
i was a terrible husband .
i was never around .
i know i &apos;m hard on you ,
but you &apos;re not the worst son @-@ in @-@ law in the world .
mike , that &apos;s the nicest thing you &apos;ve ever said to me .
well , i &apos;m drunk .
i just vomited on a lot of clowns .
