It's good to see you. How's everything been?
You, too. I'm ready. I'm ready.
You have the gift?
Here we go. Boom! There you go.
Oh, my god.
Look at that, oh! It's amazing!
Oh, my god. I love it.
Hey, if you like the way it looks, that's all Tory.
I love my new necklace.
Thank you.
You're...
welcome.
She not...
appreciate Tory.
I do.
What I do doesn't matter, Ten Mohs.
It's you that everyone cares about.
I'm...
I'm...
Ten Mohs? You okay?
Not.
No...
Give me that again?
Yo, Ten Mohs! What's happening, man?
I'll get 9-1-1!
Not!
Good morning.
Good morning.
I got a new T-shirt.
You can borrow something of mine.
Oh, they say we should learn to live with less.
Don't listen to "They."
The...
"A.I."?
Artificial intelligence.
You're getting a call from the future.
It's actually from the past.
It's my father. Arthur.
Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques?
Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous?
Do you want me to answer it?
Nope.
Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines
Ding, ding, dong, ding, ding, dong.
Well, that was interesting.
I just can't be bothered right now.
You're here dealing with the effects of a fire
that destroyed all your personal stuff,
not to mention a lifetime of memories.
I lost 20 identical T-shirts.
You lost a lot more than that.
Okay, is this, like, some new therapy?
Like a "Shove it in your face" kind of thing?
'Cause it's awesome.
I did not mean to. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Faulty wiring. Moving on. I'm fine.
Well, I don't know why you won't stay at my guest room.
That hotel mattress is killing your back.
I stayed in your guest room for four days.
And if I would've stayed one more day...
I would have missed the weekend series.
And that's not gonna happen. No, it isn't.
Which weekend series?
The...red sox/angels.
Uh, wanted to see that fish kid play.
Uh, trout.
Oh, he's a cutie.
That's what I like in my ballplayers.
Cutie-ness.
Okay, you aren't staying because of your mother?
What? Huh?
Uh...nothing. We were just talking about --
I'm gonna change up my look.
What do you think about pastels?
Well, how about something with a collar?
That's ridiculous.
What? Why?
Yeah. What?! Why?!
Rizzoli.
I don't understand you two.
Ma, thank you. Been very helpful.
Your father's calling.
All right.
You think you're so clever.
Isles.
You do.
It's not like I don't appreciate her concern,
but she just kept... touching my head.
You could ask her to stop.
And then ask her to stop the other 100 things
that made me wanna go to a hotel?
Your mother is a wonderful and caring woman.
Yes, unlike your father Arthur.
I never said Arthur wasn't wonderful.
No, you don't say anything about him at all.
And you call him "Arthur."
It's his name.
He traveled a lot. There isn't much to tell.
Why is he calling?
I don't know. I didn't answer.
What do you got?
Teddy Marshall.
A.K.A., Ten Mohs.
Maximum hardness on a gemmological scale.
Jeweler to the rich and famous.
How famous?
Rappers, athletes,
young people with a lot of money
and no understanding of understatement.
According to his bodyguard,
Ten Mohs was having a great night.
Top dog in the V.I.P. room,
buying champagne for his adoring public.
Then he starts talking gibberish,
walks in here, and dies.
Stroke?
Well, it's possible,
but there's signs of acute cyanosis,
which are not usually present in stroke or cardiac arrest.
Let me guess. All the partygoers
ran out when he called 9-1-1?
Like the wind.
Kitchen staff?
What's faster than the wind?
Kitchen staff with visa problems?
He sparkles.
What, like he was too close to a stripper?
Well, doesn't look like glitter,
but I'm not well-versed in makeup of that...sort.
Can we -- can we move him?
Sure.
Wanna help me with this?
Carrying a gun didn't get him killed,
but maybe the reason he was carrying a gun did.
The safe hasn't been touched.
There are thousands of dollars worth of gems
just lying in these drawers.
If it wasn't about money, why would anyone kill him?
Well, we don't know that he was murdered, Ms. Garret.
He was young, healthy, didn't do drugs, only drank a little.
What else could've happened?
That's what they're trying to figure out, Tory.
No, they're he talking to me, which is doing nothing.
And whoever killed him is gonna come for me next.
Why would you be a target?
Ten Mohs and I were partners.
He found the gems. I designed the jewelry.
Made a great team. Revenues were up 200% this year.
So that means someone else was down that equal amount.
And Ten Mohs couldn't resist rubbing their noses in it.
Is that why he was carrying an unlicensed handgun?
Yeah, but... it's also part of the image.
Could you give us the names of these other jewelers?
Of course. Um...
Maurice, the Eightmans,
Cheeky,
Hugh and Todd,
And we practically drove Blingman out of business
two months ago.
Could you give us their real names, please?
I can make some calls.
Thank you. That'd be very helpful.
Oh, I've been thinking about your wardrobe,
and I was wrong about starting with ensembles.
You're not an ensemble person.
You just need a few high quality pieces,
And we'll build from there.
I just need a new pair of pants --
Is this why you brought me down here?
No.
Ten Mohs ingested an S.T.X. Neurotoxin
that blocked the transmission of signals
between his body and brain,
Causing paralysis to the voluntary muscles.
So he couldn't breathe?
Well, other things happened, too, but that's why he died.
And where does one get this S.T.X. Neurotoxin?
Well, shellfish contaminated with toxic algae blooms,
puffer fish.
Wait a minute. Isn't that that sushi
that you can't eat 'cause it'll kill you?
Yes, if it's not well prepared.
As little as 25 milligrams could be fatal.
Well, he could've had that voluntarily.
Well, it wasn't on the club's menu.
But that's not a surprise.
In Japan, chefs have to be licensed to serve it.
So a black market puffer fish?
So if he didn't eat it voluntarily,
it would've been very easy to hide in an oyster shooter,
which was the only thing he ate or drank last night.
Diamonds...on his fingers and in his stomach.
Hmm. A high refractive index of diamonds
would explain the shimmer on the fingers.
I sent a tech over to the club.
Apparently, our Mr. Ten Mohs likes his drinks spiked
with gypsum dust from the gems he's cut for his clients.
Uh, it's not Mr. Ten Mohs. It's just "Ten Mohs."
Oh. Right. Like "Cher."
No. Nothing like that.
Cher is amazing.
Ten Mohs is just silly.
So do the diamond flakes
have anything to do with why he's dead?
No. Just a little factoid plated for your edification.
Thank you, Kent.
You two should get married, and then have children
that get their butts kicked on the tetherball court.
Mike "Cheeky" Jones. Did two years for assault.
Licensed to carry a concealed weapon.
DeSean and Reggie Fournier, A.K.A. The Eightmans,
are college graduates and registered brokers.
And completely ridiculous.
Oh, yeah.
All this research made me wanna call their mamas.
Hugh and Todd are actually named Hugh and Todd.
Minor drug-related charges.
Marvin Harris, A.K.A. "Blingman,"
just filed for personal bankruptcy.
Tha's motive. And we know where the name "Blingman" comes from.
The dictionary, under "Subtlety."
That's all I got, except Ten Mohs gets sued a lot,
including by Millie Juarez.
She's the mother of his child.
After she had the baby, she filed a bunch of suits
regarding support and custody issues.
Always withdrew them, but...
Could be she had a habit of shaking him down.
Maybe. But their texts, at least the ones I found,
are very cordial.
And Ten Mohs is up to date on all his child support payments.
What about the other lawsuits?
Mostly nuisance suits. There was one civil suit.
He's being sued for theft of a --
Erase another one from the chalkboard.
We have a chalkboard?
We used to. It was very satisfying.
Uniforms are bringing in the guy named Blingman.
That's not his real name.
Maybe not, but he's a real suspect.
He's telling anyone who'll listen
that he killed Ten Mohs.
That's a black diamond, isn't it?
Ten Mohs specialty?
Trashy bullshit specialty.
The whole point of a diamond is the sparkle.
There's no sparkle there.
It's black. It don't know how to sparkle.
Man, Marvin, you must've been something
before Ten Mohs ran you out of business.
People get tired of those things,
and Blingman will be ready.
Blingman will be in jail.
Not a great retail environment.
I'm not going to jail.
You didn't do it.
You said it.
Okay, I want you to write down how you killed Ten Mohs.
And if you don't do it,
I'm gonna go out on the street and tell everybody
how you cried like a baby when you got in here.
Go ahead. Just write down how you did it.
"I, Blingman, killed Ten Mohs, that punk."
It lacks detail. Try again.
You're just trying to get some street cred.
He made me look like a fool.
You are a fool.
At least I'm on the up-and-up. That guy -- he was shady.
What kind of shady?
You don't get diamonds at those prices
unless you're helping people move things
that are hard to move.
You're saying he was working for the drug cartel?
As I said, trashy bullshit.
Too bad it isn't a crime to be stupid.
The prisons would be full, the streets would be empty.
Yeah.
Ten Mohs was being sued
over a $200,000 black diamond
that a tribe from the amazon rain forest says he stole.
Motive. I like it.
Hey, ma. What's up? I'm working.
The trial starts in three days,
and we just found out that the lead plaintiff,
a tribal elder named Raya,
arrived in Boston yesterday.
Opportunity. Love it.
We have an address on this guy?
All right, all right,
I'll be down in the lobby in two minutes.
Technically, talking to your mother isn't working.
She needs me.
You know, I don't have time for this.
For what?
We're having a meeting.
About what? I didn't prep for a meeting.
No prep necessary.
Look, Jane's been through a lot.
She needs us to figure out how we can help her.
She told me all she needs is pants.
No, she needs to get out of that hotel.
True.
Otherwise, she's gonna become stooped and grumpy.
True.
Okay, so we're in agreement.
I'll move in with Frankie,
and Jane will move into the guesthouse.
W-what now? I did not agree to that.
I just agreed that
I don't want Jane to end up stooped and grumpy.
Look, Frankie, it's the only thing that makes sense.
After what she's been through,
she needs privacy and space
to figure out what she's gonna do next,
and she needs the love and support
of her friends and family.
Beautifully said, Angela.
Thank you.
Et tu, maura?
You're a good boy.
Great meeting.
I'm gonna be sad if this guy admits it
and we don't have to work tonight.
You need the overtime?
No, I j- My hotel is uncomfortable.
And lonely.
You can come stay with me.
Oh, yeah. Like I wanna listen to you
talk goofy to Kiki all night on the phone.
No, thank you.
Can I help you?
I'm detective Korsak. Boston homicide.
This is detective Rizzoli. We're looking for Raya.
Why?
Well, I think that's between him and us.
Well, I'm sorry. He's not here. Perhaps you can come back later?
You know what?
I think we'll wait here,
if that's okay with you, mister...
Doctor.
Dr. Arthur Isles.
So you...
work with Maura then?
Yes. And you're in town?
Yes.
Uh, I come to Boston regularly.
When will Raya be back?
Why would homicide detectives be looking for Raya?
Well, it's an ongoing investigation.
The victim is Teddy Marshall, a.K.A. Ten Mohs.
Oh. My.
We know about the lawsuit.
And you think Raya may have killed him.
Because of "The Darkness"?
Excuse me?
A diamond known as "The Darkness."
It's a 20-karat black diamond
of great cultural importance to the Sororo people.
Uh, we just wanna ask him a few questions.
The diamond was stolen,
and the Sororo have taken legal and appropriate steps
to secure its return.
If that's the case, then he has nothing to worry about.
What exactly is your connection to all of this?
I have lived and worked on and off over 20 years
with the Sororo people.
They needed an intermediary to pursue their legal case.
I agreed to be that person.
While it is true that Raya had motive to kill this Ten Mohs,
he didn't do it.
How can you be so sure?
Well, other than the sightseeing trip he took an hour ago,
he's been with me since his arrival in Boston.
I'd have noticed something.
All the same,
I'd like you to give us a call when he comes back.
It's very nice to meet you, Dr. Isles.
Even under the circumstances, thank you kindly.
You are not gonna believe who I just ran into.
Tommy.
No.
The family that adopted Jo Friday.
No.
The chef that's building
out the restaurant down the street.
Mnh-mnh.
Tasha.
Nope.
That sox fellow you like so much?
Okay, I obviously don't know.
I just ran into the other Dr. Isles.
Oh. I'm glad.
That's it? You're glad?
I assume nothing bad happened to him,
or you would've been much more compassionate.
Your father is buddy-buddy with a murder suspect.
Okay, really? We're just not gonna talk about this at all?
Talk about what?
The fact that "Your father" and "Murder"
are in the same sentence.
We talk about murder all the time.
Okay, it's obvious that something is going on
between you and your father and has been for a long time...
Because you have absolutely no poker face.
Yes, I do.
Have you ever beat me in cards?
No.
Look, Maura, I just want you to know
that, as your friend, if you need me, I'm here.
He's a liar.
Your father?
Whatever he says, it's never the whole truth.
It may not even be part of the truth.
I didn't find much.
All right, show me what you got.
He appears to be a busy guy with a high tolerance for bugs.
Years of field research in the amazon rain forest.
Must've been hard on her with him gone so much.
Yeah.
So what's his story on this trip to Boston?
His passport entered the country at the same time as raya's,
And so far, it looks like they've eaten all their meals
in the hotel.
Raya doesn't have a cell phone,
And we're not gonna get a warrant for Dr. Isles', so...
So we can't confirm if they were in the hotel.
Okay, what about the security video at the club?
Are either one of them on it?
They aren't, but there are no cameras in the kitchen,
and the staff leaves the door to the alley open.
Would've been easy enough to sneak in.
Okay. Thanks.
Jane.
Yeah?
Three large checks just hit Ten Mohs' bank account
they're dated for today.
Who's writing checks for a dead guy?
Millie Juarez, the mother of his baby.
She lives on the east side.
Frankie and Korsak are canvassing raya's hotel.
It's in that area. I'll call 'em.
How did she think she'd get away
with writing those checks to herself
after Ten Mohs was dead?
Yeah. And be smart. Always backdate your crime.
You know... if you and I went rogue,
I think we'd make pretty good criminals.
You?
Yeah.
The guy who hates to cut in line?
Well, I'm not saying I'm going to the dark side,
but...I think I'd be pretty good at it.
If I wanted to, which I don't.
What's that?
What?
Somebody over there.
Boston P.D.!
Drop it!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.
Why were you trying to break into the house?
Put your hands behind your head.
Before Ten Mohs died, he said, "Shoot her."
You thought he meant Millie?
She had been at the club earlier,
shaking him down for extra child support.
Did he give it to her?
Yeah, he agreed to give her 25% more.
Get on up.
Gave her a bunch of signed checks.
Maybe those checks she cashed
were her way of getting what she's owed.
Ten Mohs is dead.
You still thought you had to follow through?
I wasn't gonna hurt her. That baby needs his mom.
I just thought I'd scare her a little.
He said "Shooter," Not "Shoot her."
What?
Shooter.
Like... oyster shooter.
He must've realized one of them was bad
when his lips went numb.
Oh, I... I thought he...
Well, I-I didn't know he meant...
I really miss Ten Mohs.
There you go.
There I go. Where am I going?
That is the D.N.A. signature
of a fresh water puffer fish found in the amazon.
That is the D.N.A. signature
of the puffer fish that killed ten mohs.
Jeez! What the hell?!
Puffer fish actually taste quite delicious.
What are you doing?!
I was... looking for my pen? Little tense, are we?
Little weird, are we?
It actually... just tastes like chicken.
Any more questions?
So many.
All right, fine, I'll be getting back to my work then.
I mean, I don't wanna paint the entire country
with just one brush... but the Scottish guy? Weird.
That's not important right now.
Okay.
Read this.
"Fish toxins & hunting methods -- an ethnological survey."
That article is my father's PhD
in killing things with puffer fish toxins.
You don't think your father killed Ten Mohs, do you?
No.
No, I just...
Some people use these to go up and down.
Hello.
Everything all right?
Yeah. I was thinking about family.
And murder.
Anything I can do?
Yeah, you can help me with the second one.
It wasn't the mother of his baby.
She wrote the checks,
but Ten Mohs gave them to her signed.
She has five she hasn't even cashed.
Yeah, and then this Sororo guy.
I mean, they believe in eye for an eye justice.
So maybe poisoning ten mohs with a fish found in their river
returns things to balance.
Raya's in interrogation with Dr. Isles.
Does raya speak english?
Nope. Spanish.
Paging senor Korsak.
Y tambien senorita Jane.
I have no ideal what you just said,
but let me tell you what's gonna happen.
You're gonna go in there
and you're gonna say something to him,
and then you're gonna tell me what you said.
And then he's gonna say something to you,
and you're gonna tell me what he said.
And then I'll say...
See ya later.
Good luck.
这里我说了算 明白吗
你的回答会起到很重要的作用
I can talk to him. You don't really need to be here.
He doesn't understand our legal system.
I'm here to protect him.
它生长在你们的河里
It is outrageous that you even suggest
this man has something to do with the murder.
The Sororo are known for an eye for an eye justice.
I read it here in this paper by Dr. Arthur Isles.
That was a long time ago. Their conditions have evolved.
Evolution's a slow progress.
None of this ties Raya to the murder.
Not yet, but it makes him murder-adjacent,
And that's a bad neighborhood.
You're free to go.
Officer Garcia will collect your passports.
Have you seen Nina?
Stepped out.
All right. Can you tell her I'm looking for her?
Okay.
Thanks.
Janie!
Yes. Have you seen Nina?
No.
All right, I'll try her cell.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We need to talk.
What is wrong?
There was a meeting -- me, Maura, mom.
And mom has decided that she should move in with me
so that you can live with Maura.
Okay. That works.
No, no, no! It does not!
I know a really bad thing had happened to you,
But this is an even worse thing happening to me.
Mom moving in with you is worse than my apartment burning down?
I would set myself on fire to keep this from happening.
Wow. Okay, well, then you need to tell mom how you feel.
I don't wanna be the guy
who tells his mother she can't move in with him.
You the guy who doesn't want his mother to move in with him.
Right, but I can't say that or imply it.
Well, what are you thinking, Frankie?
Shadow puppets? You wanna mime something?
Mom figures things out. She makes leaps.
Like, do you remember the time when I told her
I needed a more manly deodorant,
And she guessed that I was having sex with Ann Tomasino?
Okay, fine. I'll talk to her.
You will?
Yes.
Thank you. Oh, God, thank you. I owe you.
Yes, y-yes!
You do owe me. You owe me Red Sox tickets.
Absolutely.
And two beers, a pretzel, and a foam finger.
Deal. But I pick out the finger.
I already know what stupid finger you're gonna pick out.
Goodbye, please!
I'll let Nina know you were looking for her.
Don't stop dreamin', 'cause it keeps you moving on.
Just dream away.
Kepp believin'.
Thanks, mom.
Oh, hey! Wait, wait, wait!
Listen, I think that you should stay at Maura's.
What?
What?
Yes. Everything is working out for you,
and I don't wanna displace you. It's just...
Jane's right, ma. She's never been righter.
Don't displace.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
I almost...
I got -- I got a tear in my eye.
This whole mother/daughter thing, it's really beautiful.
Yeah, but if I stay at Maura's, where are you gonna go?
I'll move in with Frankie.
That's fantastic!
Yeah!
My children together again! I love it!
Okay, next round on me.
What the hell was that?
She was gonna ask me where I was going.
I had to have a plan.
Well, you should've had a good plan.
What'd I miss?
Well, my life is over.
The bathroom line wasn't that long.
I'm moving in with Frankie.
Oh, God.
I know, right? See? I'm not the only one
who thinks that it's...
I was just leaving, but you're welcome to stay.
I need to talk to you about your case.
Doctor to doctor?
You're not a doctor. You're a PhD.
Raya has a daughter -- Karina.
She had access to Amazonian puffer fish.
She is in Boston.
Your friends seem very concerned.
You should rejoin them.
Karina Sororo.
That's the same last name as the tribe.
When someone leaves the tribal lands,
they take the tribe's name as their surname.
Maintains a connection.
I read Dr. Isles' other papers.
Karina's a student at B.U.
She's working on her M.B.A.
That's impressive.
And she likes the nightlife.
I checked with the doorman.
She was on the V.I.P. list the night Ten Mohs died.
So she had access.
It gets better.
She was put on the list by Ten Mohs himself.
Girlfriend?
Business partner.
She supplied Ten Mohs with diamonds.
Lots of diamonds.
Okay, so what do we think?
She got scared when Ten Mohs wound up with the darkness
and her father found out?
Or she didn't want her father to find out,
and she killed Ten Mohs to keep him quiet.
Or "C," she had second thoughts because her father found out,
and they did it together.
He had deadly fish. She had access.
It's always "C."
Where were you in high school?
All right, I will get a warrant for her apartment.
Frankie and I will go check out
and see if she's hanging around her father's hotel.
Dr. Isles?
Oh, an officer said it would be okay if I waited here.
Yeah, of course.
I'm actually in the middle of an investigation,
so I was just on my way out.
Oh. Of course.
Did you need something?
My wife, uh...
has told me about how important you are to Maura,
how much she relies on your counsel.
If you knew who I was, why did you pretend that you didn't?
It...
Um, seemed easier.
Somehow.
I don't know.
Okay, I...
Muffed that one.
But I was wondering...
Could you put in a good word for me?
With Maura?
You know, Maura gave her kidney to someone that she barely knew.
So if she's this mad, it's probably gonna take some time.
So I should...
Not give up.
Maybe stop making such easy choices?
I'm -- I'm sorry. I...
Oh. I understand.
Thanks for coming down to the station, Ms. Sororo.
We just have a few questions.
We have receipts that show
you've been selling Sororo diamonds to Ten Mohs for over a year.
He paid his taxes like a good tax-paying hip-hop jeweler.
We found it in her apartment.
Did you sell him that, too?
The darkness was found by a logger,
someone who was already stealing from our lands.
I knew about Ten Mohs,
his love for black diamonds, so I reached out to him.
To see if he wanted to buy some black diamonds?
To see if he had any information
that could help me recover the darkness.
We met here, in Boston.
We realized that we could help each other.
How?
He liked diamonds. I had diamonds.
So I sold them to him
in exchange for helping me get the darkness back.
I read a few academic papers.
The Sororo don't sell anything from their land.
Which is why they starve.
I used that money to build roads and a school,
so children could have the opportunities I had.
How'd your father feel about that?
My father hates roads.
So you killed Ten Mohs to keep him from outing you to your father?
You think that I killed him?
Didn't you?
Teddy?
No.
I was in love with him.
So whoever killed Ten Mohs...
wanted it to reflect back on the Sororo.
It turns out Karina was at a study group
while Ten Mohs was downing oysters.
Passed up the V.I.P. Room for the library? That's interesting.
Mm, you've seen one V.I.P. Room...
You've seen one?
In the...daytime.
On my way to a dead body.
I followed up your hunch
that the murder was personal, not business.
And I checked Ten Mohs' phone records from before he met Karina.
Oh. Ten Mohs and Tory were dating.
Lot of calls, lot of texts.
Then they trailed off.
That's not enough to arrest her.
So Ten Mohs was mixing business with pleasure.
That's trouble.
Not as much as mixing pleasure with pleasure.
Perhaps Ten Mohs didn't tell Tory the relationship was over.
A girl could get mighty upset if she found out on her own.
Why are you here?
Ah. A list of puffer fish recipes.
Don't try them without a license.
I wasn't planning on it.
Yeah, neither was I, but then...
Well, that's a...story for another day.
Promise?
That's actually a list of all the people who do have a license
to import amazonian puffer fish.
As requested.
Thank you.
Well, let's go see Tory.
Send her picture to all the importers,
see if she bought a fish.
Uh, you better hurry.
Why?
I called her about an hour ago and told her
we might need to ask her some questions about Karina.
Who she knows is innocent.
Go to her house, make sure she's still in town.
I'll check her bank records and recent purchases.
Maybe she bought a plane ticket.
All right. Let's go.
设计珠宝需提前预约
Let's try around back.
Oh. When I travel, I usually pack clothes.
What are you doing here?
Of course, if you bring jewelry, you can trade it for clothes
or a toothbrush.
Oh, no, no, no.
Where she's going, they'll give her a toothbrush.
You know, if you're going to the airport...
You are gonna pay extra for this one.
I'm not going anywhere.
The jewels are traveling alone?
Given all that's been happening,
I thought it best to close up and secure the inventory.
You never told us you were dating Ten Mohs.
A lot of people dated Ten Mohs.
Yes, but Karina was a threat.
She loved him.
So did you.
Loving Ten Mohs isn't a crime.
Where is your aquarium?
I don't have an aquarium.
The clerk from the store I.D.'d you.
He said that you bought 20 puffer fish.
You're under arrest for the murder of Teddy Marshall.
Here's your nice, shiny, new bracelet.
Allow me.
You have the right to remain silent.
Ms. Sororo, you're free to go.
Is my dad waiting for me?
Yes. He's in the lobby.
He'll sit there for days if he has to.
The Sororo don't use the future tense.
Now is forever, and that's a problem.
Someday, I'll be the leader of the Sororo.
I think about that -- the future. He doesn't.
So you think he's waiting down there to argue with you?
Yes.
You've made hard choices before.
I'm not sure I believe
that's what you're really worried about.
I was going to tell my father
about my relationship with Ten Mohs...
after the trial.
Now you never need to tell him.
You think he deserves to know the truth?
I don't have a daughter.
But if I did, I'd want her to be straight with me.
You know? Go talk to him.
We really need him out of the lobby.
Janie, we can make this work,
but we just have to lay down some ground rules.
Ground rules?
Like for instance, see that drawer?
Don't open it.
Okay.
Ah! See?
That...was a test. You failed.
Now you will never know the location of my secret drawer.
Can I use your computer?
Of course.
Good. I'm gonna stay at a hotel.
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
Look, we can do this. We just have a few more rules.
All right?
Okay.
Dishes in the sink, rinsed.
If you finish my cereal, replace it.
And please...
don't dry your...brassiere in my shower.
Okay, please don't ever say the word "brassiere," Francis.
Don't call me that.
Fine, Franklin.
That's not even my name.
Well, can I open the door,
or is there a rule against that, too?
Hey! Glad you're here.
You can help me find Frankie's porn drawer.
It's a secret drawer.
That means it's weird porn.
Hey, Maura.
Don't touch her brassiere.
Why would he touch my brassiere?
He's got a thing.
I don't have a thing.
Can I talk to you? Privately.
Yeah. Sure.
Um, please, come into my secret tiny, tiny, room.
That's not it.
You better hide your secret tiny, tiny porn.
Um... wow. You weren't kidding.
No, I was not.
Okay. What's up?
What I say cannot leave this room.
What you say cannot fit in this room.
When I was 14,
my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard --
she lived next door.
And one day, she didn't show up for school.
So on my way home, I thought I would stop by,
see if she wanted to know what the homework was.
Mnh, she didn't.
I'm sorry.
So I knocked on the door. Nobody answered.
I went inside, I went up the stairs,
and I saw Mrs. Jaquard's door open.
I could see her inside, lying on the bed,
pulling up the sheets...
as Arthur came out, buttoning up his shirt.
Up until then, he was...
a hero to me.
He broke my heart.
Oh, Maura.
So he...
begged me not to say anything.
I didn't, to anyone.
But not telling my mother...
keeping it inside, it...
it feels like that lie is still inside,
like living in there.
I think that's why I have such a hard time
not telling the truth, why I break out in hives.
Well...I love that you can't tell a lie.
But you think I'm a coward.
What? No. Why?
Because I'm avoiding him,
not confronting him about it.
Maura, I live in a 2x3 room
in order to avoid living with my mother.
You were a child,
and he put you in a terrible position.
But it was so long ago.
You want me to shoot him?
I do. I really do.
Okay.
But instead, maybe I'll talk to him first.
Fine, but let me know if you change your mind.
We'll see how the talk goes.
Otherwise, you are very good at shooting my relatives.
Let's go find Frankie's secret drawer.
I heard that!
Oh, we're gonna have so much fun.
Come on!
