第十三集
you &apos;re going to hell ?
the underworld . i &apos;m getting him back .
my time in the underworld is done .
yours can be , too . just do what i say .
tell me your father &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s in a better place now .
that means everyone here ...
can be saved .
is this a bloody trick ? !
stop .
that &apos;s exactly what it is --
a trick .
don &apos;t move .
he wants you to think you can escape , but ...
you can &apos;t .
no one can .
aye .
we &apos;ll see about that .
don &apos;t !
he &apos;ll hunt you down .
hades has already done his worst to me .
i don &apos;t mean hades .
who , then ?
no .
just don &apos;t .
look , this isn &apos;t my first cell .
i don &apos;t just sit around and rot .
now , somebody &apos;s come down here to save me ,
and i need to make her job easier .
how do you know she &apos;s here ?
she got me a message .
how do you know that wasn &apos;t one of hades &apos; tricks ?
because i know !
when you love someone , you know .
now , what &apos;s keeping us in here ?
something you don &apos;t want to face .
well , i &apos;ll be the judge of that .
time to go .
are you mad ?
perhaps .
but i &apos;m the best chance you have .
here .
you ready ?
all right , go . go !
i told you we &apos;ll never make it .
we won &apos;t ... but you will .
i &apos;ll draw the hell beasts away . you run .
and once you &apos;re free , find emma swan .
i &apos;m captain killian jones -- captain hook .
tell her to find me .
okay .
go !
mary margaret . what are -- what are you doing ?
we &apos;ve got a lot of ground to cover .
david , these graves .
they &apos;re all from my father &apos;s kingdom .
they were my subjects . i was supposed to protect them .
and now how am i supposed to protect our daughter
in the underworld ?
because you &apos;re not doing this alone .
mary margaret , we will find a way to protect emma .
we always do .
now , come on .
she &apos;s looking for hook in the woods just south of here .
she &apos;s good ...
but nobody &apos;s better at tracking than bandit snow .
let &apos;s go help her .
what is it ?
mary margaret ? what &apos;s wrong ?
princess snow , you must stop him .
the bandit and his men --
they &apos;re terrorizing our villages and roads .
but my father -- he &apos;s on a diplomatic mission .
i &apos;ll send word to him .
by the time it reaches him , we will all be dead .
we need help now .
fear not .
my stepdaughter will take care of all of you .
i will ?
what do we do ?
people are dying .
princess snow ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no .
help !
anyone ? !
grab on . i &apos;ll pull you up .
thank you .
you gotta watch out for hunter traps .
i &apos;m snow white .
yes .
you certainly are .
i &apos;m hercules .
but you can call me herc .
you ... knew hercules ?
we were friends when we were kids .
define &quot; friends . &quot;
do i detect a hint of jealousy ?
oh , it &apos;s not every day your wife
tells you that she was friends with a god .
a demi @-@ god ...
who also happens to be dead .
hey , i &apos;m sorry . i was just giving you a hard time .
no , i know . i know .
david ...
... if he &apos;s down here , he has unfinished business .
we have to help him find a way to move on .
at the expense of searching for hook ?
no , david , think about it .
he &apos;s ... hercules .
he can help us .
we save him .
he can save us .
mom , we already covered this trail .
it was cold .
then we cover it again ,
and we keep going until we find a trail that &apos;s hot .
you think there &apos;d be more of those in the underworld .
there &apos;s no sign of hook in the north woods .
well , we have to keep going .
maybe out by the troll bridge .
wait .
what ?
there may be a way to make our search quicker .
how ?
in storybrooke , i have schematics --
maps -- of the whole town .
every last inch of it .
so you think the equivalent maps of this town are here ?
everything else in bizarro storybrooke
has an analog so far .
i &apos;m on it . you keep working here .
i &apos;ll go get you your intel .
wait .
take henry .
it might be dangerous .
my mother &apos;s gone now . the office should be empty .
and no one knows it better than henry .
he &apos;ll be fine . you &apos;ll be there to protect him .
all right , come on . let &apos;s go .
all right , let &apos;s get back to it .
emma ?
regina , i found something !
blood .
there &apos;s a trail of it .
it &apos;s not dry yet . it &apos;s fresh .
killian .
killian ? !
killian ? !
not killian , but i know him .
who are you ? where &apos;s killian ?
we have to get out of here .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s coming . hide me . we have to go -- now !
your parents &apos; apartment ? really ?
it &apos;s the first place i thought of .
here . lie down .
what if whoever -- or whatever -- lives here ,
you know , comes home ?
i don &apos;t think we have to worry about that .
so this place is just waiting for your parents to die
so they can move in ?
creepy , but that seems to be the case .
i think we &apos;re safe here .
it &apos;s officially a cold day in hell
when i move in with the charmings .
are you okay ?
i will be .
and hook ?
i ...
i don &apos;t know .
where is he ?
in an underground prison .
i escaped through tunnels .
they let out in a
cave somewhere in the woods , and ...
next thing i knew , you found me .
where is the cave ? could you find it again ?
yes .
but it &apos;s being guarded by something ...
terrible .
what &apos;s guarding the cave ?
it ...
it has three heads .
its -- its teeth
can crush your bones with a single bite .
and those eyes ...
... they burn right through your soul
as it finishes you off .
nothing can defeat this monster .
that &apos;s not true .
i know exactly what this beast is ...
... and how we can defeat it .
so , are you really a god ?
demi @-@ god .
my mother was mortal .
i &apos;ve never met a demi @-@ anything before .
i can &apos;t join my father on mount olympus
until i complete my twelve labors .
and then you &apos;ll be immortal ?
that &apos;s the idea .
but as much as i like discussing my family tree ,
you can &apos;t avoid yours forever .
i can &apos;t face anyone
until i figure out what to do about the bandits .
i &apos;ve got your answer .
you &apos;re gonna fight them .
me ?
i &apos;m not a hero .
you will be after i train you .
no .
snow ...
you can &apos;t let the fear of failing
stop you from trying .
this medal --
it was for the first labor i ever completed --
defeating the nemean lion .
i was scared .
but i didn &apos;t back down .
i fought the lion , and i won .
and i wouldn &apos;t have this medal
if i &apos;d been too afraid to try .
easy for you to say .
snow ...
i &apos;m going to teach you how to stand up to those bandits
so they never show their faces in your kingdom again .
why are you doing this for me ?
because you &apos;re gonna make a great queen one day .
i &apos;m a good judge of character .
and also , uh ...
... it gives me an excuse to
spend as much time as i can with you
before i complete my final labor .
i only have a few fleeting moments down here .
and i want to enjoy them .
so , what exactly is your last labor ?
it &apos;s the most difficult one of them all ...
... defeating the three @-@ headed hellhound -- cerberus .
you really think she &apos;ll know where he is ?
of course .
we need someone who sees everyone .
hey , child @-@ muncher .
we &apos;re looking for someone .
why should i help you , regina ?
you burned me alive .
it was hansel and gretel .
at your behest , and with your fireball .
fine . fine .
but you stole my apple .
what do you think happens when you steal from a witch , witch ?
fair enough .
so , who are you looking for ?
his name &apos;s hercules .
you know , from the myths .
i know who hercules is .
he comes in here on his lunch break every day .
and no matter how hard i try to fatten him up ,
his muscles are always bulging .
it &apos;s a shame .
he &apos;d make a great sunday roast .
lunch break from where ?
herc ?
you don &apos;t recognize me , do you ?
snow ?
you &apos;re still so young .
when -- how did ... ?
you mean , uh , how did i die ?
that &apos;s , uh --
that -- that &apos;s not important .
what are you doing down here ?
i mean , how did you ... ?
i &apos;m not dead .
um , i came down here to help my daughter .
you have a daughter ?
and a son .
and a grandson , actually .
you are not a grandmother .
actually ...
it &apos;s kind of a convoluted story ,
but , um , i am .
it &apos;s been quite a life .
yeah .
yeah , i wish i could say the same .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what if i told you there might be a way
for you to leave the underworld once and for all ?
i never finished my labors .
i can &apos;t move on until i do .
i know .
and cerberus is here .
here ?
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s guarding a prison
where the man my daughter loves is being held . and ...
hercules , you &apos;re the only one
strong enough to defeat that beast .
it &apos;s your destiny .
well , that hero died .
only if you let him .
don &apos;t forget what you taught me .
you can &apos;t let fear of failure keep you from trying .
oh , this is going to be quite an exciting day .
it will be ... when i kill you .
why does everyone say that ?
you can &apos;t kill me . i &apos;m hades .
this -- this is death .
well , then , i &apos;ll find whatever &apos;s worse
and do it to you .
oh , i see you &apos;ve --
you met my pet .
you &apos;re about to realize his master
is not nearly as friendly .
wait .
protection spell .
looks like grandma cora left this place locked up .
not completely .
okay .
all right . you stay here .
no .
someone needs to stand guard outside ,
and only one of us knows
where to look in my mom &apos;s office .
be very careful .
hello , darling .
cruella .
tell me , how is your mother ?
oh , yes , with you , i need to be more specific .
how is the one that killed me ?
this is the tunnel she said she came out of .
hook &apos;s in here somewhere .
all right , wonder boy ,
are you sure you can do this ?
regina !
i know you can do this .
we &apos;ll find your friend . don &apos;t worry .
wait for me here .
where &apos;s the rest of it ?
that &apos;s all we have .
i swear .
leave my people alone !
princess snow , please , help us .
where &apos;s your daddy &apos;s army ?
i don &apos;t need ... an army .
return what you &apos;ve taken from these people
and leave my kingdom ...
or the next arrow lands in your good eye .
i &apos;d like to see you try .
run back to your palace , little girl .
these are my woods now .
leave her alone !
or you &apos;re going to have to answer to me .
your boyfriend won &apos;t be around to protect you forever .
we did exactly what you asked .
there &apos;s more where this came from .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to kill her ?
i won &apos;t turn her into a martyr for these people to worship .
no .
i have to turn them against her .
and these miserable people will finally realize the truth .
i am meant to be their queen .
herc !
come on .
what the hell was that ?
i called them off .
who are you ?
my uncle .
hades ?
don &apos;t look so surprised .
who &apos;d you think was in charge of this place -- your mommy ?
well , if this is your realm ,
maybe you can answer a few questions .
like why does this hell @-@ hole look like storybrooke ?
i have my reasons ,
and i don &apos;t have to share them with you .
leave them alone , uncle .
there &apos;s that famous courage people love to talk about .
oh , hercules ,
did you really think you could face cerberus again ?
again ?
you mean he didn &apos;t tell you ?
cerberus killed you .
yeah , i didn &apos;t want you to know .
snow , i couldn &apos;t let you down .
well , it &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of , nephew .
after all , losing your life to my little pet
is what finally brought us together as family .
we &apos;re not afraid of you .
snow white .
or is it mary margaret ?
my nephew said you were a spitfire ,
but trust me ,
you should be quite afraid of me
because the next time you interfere with my family ,
i will come after yours .
bring it . we &apos;re not gonna rest until we find hook .
oh , and that must make you emma .
since your pirate likes to send you messages ,
i told him i would deliver this one personally .
what did you do to him ?
it &apos;s not what i &apos;ve already done you should worry about now .
it &apos;s what i &apos;m about to do .
so , darling , this is actually quite fortuitous .
what do you want ?
why , you , of course .
i need your help .
you see , hades , the being that runs this place ,
has set up the most awful conundrum .
for those of us in this ghastly underworld ,
we have two choices --
leaving for a better place or a worse one .
i think i know where you &apos;ll end up .
charming .
just like your family .
and also probably quite correct ,
which is why i need a third choice --
to go back to the real world .
oh , how i miss it .
the music , the gin , the glamour ...
the gin .
you &apos;re already dead . no one can change that .
actually , one person can -- the author .
oh , yes , that &apos;s you now .
no .
the apprentice told me it &apos;s impossible .
because he didn &apos;t want you to .
but , henry , you can .
the author &apos;s power is far greater
than that bearded old man wanted you to believe .
i destroyed the quill .
oh , yes , yes , i know what you did .
we hear it all down here .
but i &apos;m guessing you don &apos;t know much about the quill , do you ?
the sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you ,
but it is not a simple pen .
it is a magical energy .
it is a living , breathing entity .
it &apos;s alive ?
oh , yes .
and when you broke it , henry ,
you sent it right down here to the underworld ,
its purpose unfulfilled .
it epitomized unfinished business .
and now you are going to find it down here with my help .
and you &apos;re going to send me right back to our world .
why would i ever help you ?
because , henry , if i come back to life , guess what happens ?
the woman who killed me -- your mother --
is no longer a murderer .
you see ?
you see , by helping me , henry ,
you can restore mommie dearest to the pure soul she once was .
you can save her .
what are you doing ?
we have to find hook .
i can &apos;t help you .
we can &apos;t have you quitting .
i &apos;m not quitting . i &apos;m being practical .
since when are you practical ?
this is all my fault .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
hercules was destined to kill cerberus .
i thought it would help us get to hook .
but now--
now is not the time to give up .
need i remind you i dedicated years to knocking you down ?
but nothing could stop you .
you took my kingdom .
&apos;cause your curse , i lost my daughter for 28 years .
and then you found her .
you defeated me in a way no one thought was possible .
you made me your friend by never giving up on me .
so what &apos;s the difference this time ?
and how am i supposed to help anyone stand up to hades
when all i have is ... speeches about hope ?
you &apos;re right .
mary margaret can &apos;t help .
in fact , we don &apos;t need her anymore .
we need snow white .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m done , herc .
i tried to be a leader ,
but i am not cut out to be one .
regina will make a better queen than i could ever hope to be .
so you &apos;re just going to abandon your kingdom ?
i don &apos;t want to be snow white anymore .
that &apos;s a shame because i was really starting to like her .
i was crazy to think that
i could stand up to those bandits .
no one wins every battle , snow ,
especially their first .
you did .
can you keep a secret ?
my first labor nearly killed me .
it &apos;s the truth .
the nemean lion .
do you know why no one could kill it ?
&apos;cause his fur was impenetrable , like steel .
with every blow i struck , all i did was blunt my sword .
so how did you defeat it ?
when i had exhausted myself
and i thought that the beast was going to kill me ,
i accidentally dropped my torch .
i set the brush surrounding us on fire .
the flames singed the lion &apos;s fur from his body .
he wasn &apos;t invincible anymore .
and i slayed him .
don &apos;t you see ?
if i hadn &apos;t failed ,
i never would have figured out how to succeed .
okay .
so , how do i stop these bandits ?
pick it up .
it &apos;s pointless , snow .
i can &apos;t defeat cerberus .
we &apos;re just going to antagonize my uncle .
well , that &apos;s a chance we &apos;re going to have to take .
herc , how did cerberus kill you ?
why does it matter ?
because -- because that is the only way
we &apos;re gonna figure out how to defeat him next time .
he has three heads , snow .
okay , when i would face one ,
no matter how valiantly i fought ,
the other two would attack .
i never should have fought that beast alone .
well , that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to win this time .
you &apos;re not going to fight him alone .
you want to face cerberus with me ?
herc , i became that hero you always believed i could be .
and we are going to fight that three @-@ headed beast ,
and we are going to win .
regina ?
what is it ?
did mary margaret talk muscles into giving it another go ?
i don &apos;t think so .
run ! just go !
let me guess -- the cerberus ?
what do we have here ?
give it back !
princess snow .
give that woman her necklace .
then leave here and never come back .
i seem to remember
you delivering a similar warning yesterday .
give that woman her necklace .
careful .
what the ... ?
lower your weapons .
or do i need to disarm all of you ?
you think you &apos;re tough , princess ?
this isn &apos;t over .
yeah , it is .
i did it !
i knew you could do it .
thanks to you .
i guess you don &apos;t need me to train you anymore .
does this mean you &apos;re going to leave to defeat cerberus ?
do you want to come ?
i &apos;d love to .
but , herc ...
i think my people need me more right now .
you &apos;re gonna make an amazing queen .
and olympus will be lucky to have a hero like you .
are you okay ? what happened ?
cerberus . he found us .
where &apos;s the prisoner ?
she ran when the hellhound attacked .
we gave her a head start ,
but there was only so long we could hold it off .
we should split up .
we have to find her before that monster does .
go .
come on .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
we &apos;re here to help .
he found us .
what now ?
we get her in there .
come on .
any bright ideas ?
we hit all three heads at once .
how are we gonna do that ?
with her help .
give her your dagger .
no , no , i can &apos;t do that .
yes , you can .
you can .
you have to try .
ready ?
now !
i guess i &apos;m not used to all that excitement .
i &apos;m hercules .
megara .
but my friends call me meg .
thanks for the assist , meg .
i ...
i think we &apos;ve met before .
please ! please !
hey , what is it ?
it &apos;s the monster !
you &apos;re --
you &apos;re the boy that tried to save me .
&quot; tried &quot; ?
i &apos;m afraid cerberus got me ...
right after he got you .
run . run .
no , he &apos;ll kill you .
i don &apos;t care now . go .
i &apos;m so sorry , meg , i ...
what for ?
you may not have saved me back then ,
but you made up for it now .
thank you .
looks like herc found a new friend .
maybe defeating cerberus
wasn &apos;t hercules &apos; only piece of unfinished business .
maybe he needed to save her , too .
you okay ?
yeah .
you didn &apos;t know me in the enchanted forest , emma , but ...
... i was someone who took risks even when she was afraid .
i was someone who ...
i guess , inspired people .
an old enemy reminded me of that .
i just don &apos;t want to ever run the risk
of forgetting who i was again .
what are you saying , mary margaret ?
i &apos;m saying i don &apos;t want to be mary margaret anymore .
i want to be snow white again .
well , it &apos;s about time .
i think we can make that happen ...
... snow .
henry .
henry , are you all right ?
yeah .
did you find anything ?
uh , no . nothing .
dead end .
okay .
do you think you can get to the prison through the tunnels ?
yes , thanks to your map .
if it weren &apos;t for hook ,
i &apos;d still be rotting in that cell .
you &apos;ll tell him that i did the right thing ?
that he was right to trust me ?
i will .
thank you .
are you sure you don &apos;t want us to stay and help ?
i think you &apos;ve been down here long enough .
and if you don &apos;t cross before your uncle finds you ,
who knows what he &apos;ll do ?
i was right .
you became an amazing hero .
what is it ?
olympus .
the prisoner you aided in escape --
she moved on from this realm .
good for her .
get on with it , then .
oh , this ?
oh , this ? no .
this isn &apos;t for you .
it &apos;s for your friends .
yeah .
what in the bloody hell am i supposed to do with this ?
simple accounting , really .
at first , i wanted your friends to leave .
i really had such a smooth @-@ running operation
going here before they arrived ,
but now i &apos;ve decided they &apos;ve caused too much damage ,
so my vindictive side --
did you know i have one ?
it wants to punish them .
so , from now on ,
for every soul your friends free ,
one of them is going to have to stay .
and , captain ...
you get to decide who .
