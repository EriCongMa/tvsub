we live out our lives on the surgical unit .
seven days a week , 14 hours a day .
we &apos;re together more than we &apos;re apart .
george &apos;s room is bigger than mine .
after a while ...
i have more clothes ,
i should have the bigger room .
the ways of residency
i got here first .
it &apos;s meredith &apos;s house she should decide .
become the ways of life .
my room is like two inches bigger than yours
no.1 ...
you have a bigger closet .
why is everything a competition ?
always keep score .
no.2 do whatever you can to outsmart the other guy .
everywhere else is
filled with meredith &apos;s mom &apos;s boxes .
meredith ?
when is your mom coming back to town , anyway ?
because maybe we can put her boxes in storage .
unpack a few things , make this place more homey .
some throw pillows , lamps , a few paintings .
paintings would be nice .
you have this amazing stuff packed away .
i found this box with hundreds of tapes of your mother
performing amazing medical procedures .
really ? we should watch them .
meredith do you want to watch ?
meredith , do you want some privacy ?
no.3 don &apos;t make friends with the enemy .
morning , dr. bailey .
shut up .
you realize that i &apos;m an attending ,
and you &apos;re only a resident
that you work for me ?
i know i &apos;ve forgotten something .
something is happening today .
i know i should know what it is ,
but i just can &apos;t ...
all right. nice talking with you , dr. bailey .
it &apos;s right in front of my face
doctor !
whoo @-@ hoo !
now i remember .
watch out . watch out .
fools on bikes , killing themselves .
natural selection is what it is
so , what &apos;s up with the nazi ? is she off her meds ?
you never heard of the race ?
excellent board ,
well @-@ timed , balanced , efficient .
if all goes well , we &apos;ll have an early night .
chief ,
dead baby bike race started 20 minutes ago .
all right , people ! dead baby bike race day !
every year , this bar ...
the dead baby bar .
every year , they hold this underground bike race .
you wonder why someone would name a bar
something so disgusting
keep your panties on , nancy drew .
the race is completely illegal and ...
crazy .
bike messengers racing against traffic ,
trying to beat each other
for free shots of tequila .
no @-@ holds @-@ barred competition , sounds like fun .
the race doesn &apos;t even have any rules ,
except eye @-@ gouging . no eye @-@ gouging .
we &apos;ll be trapped in the pit band @-@ aiding idiots
when we could be up in the or .
what kind of people engage in a race
that has a only rule
that you can &apos;t rip out the eyeballs of another human being ?
men , georgie . men .
i need someone to get up to the or floor .
the chief needs a right hand
oh , and yeah , number four ...
george .
everything , everything , is a competition .
ok , people . the rules of trauma .
don &apos;t mingle with er interns .
they don &apos;t know their ass from esophagus .
sew fast , discharge faster .
get bodies up to the or .
and don &apos;t let me catch you fighting over patients . got it ?
come on , let &apos;s go .
oh , it &apos;s like candy , but with blood ,
which is so much better
oh , my god .
mine .
no ! i saw him first !
whoever said winning wasn &apos;t everything ...
ooh . i &apos;ll take that guy .
you &apos;ll have to beat me to him first .
... never held a scalpel .
输赢难料
heads , he &apos;s mine . tails , he &apos;s yours .
why do you get to be &quot; heads &quot; ?
i have a head , and honey , you are a tail .
excuse me .
how do you manage to make everything dirty ?
ha ! tails .
there are plenty of other cases .
so , go get one . i was here first .
i am not backing down
so i can do sutures all day
while you up in the or
this is a surgical case , and you know it .
it &apos;s superficial .
it &apos;s cool , but it &apos;s superficial .
you know those things didn &apos;t rupture his peritoneum ?
because he &apos;s sitting up
and he &apos;s sitting there talking to us .
hello . excuse me ,
i was wondering if you could take these out
and sew me up so i could go and win my race .
well , we can &apos;t just pull them out ...
we have to do some tests
ow , wicked .
are you out of your mind ?
it &apos;s a superficial wound .
sew him up and let him finish his race .
hey , good man .
john doe , mid @-@ 30s pedestrian ,
hit by a motorist swerving to avoid a bike .
gcs 3 . pupils fixed and dilated .
atropine given for a pulse in the 40s .
bp 183 over 112 . pulse ox is 98 %
chest showed widened mediastinum
and head ct revealed cerebral edema .
he &apos;s gotten 70 of mannitol ,
dexamethasone 10,
and a gram of phenytoin
get him to the or ?
is he gorked ?
looks like .
the bike race claims its first victim .
uh , dr. shepherd ?
he &apos;s not going to the or ?
no . do an eeg and confirmatory tests .
if he doesn &apos;t respond in six hours ,
declare him .
declare him ? declare him what ?
brain @-@ dead .
sir , dr. bailey sent me to assit you .
should i scrub in ?
no . i &apos;m stuck here all day .
i need you on the floor
monitoring my pre and post @-@ op patients .
you got a problem with that , o &apos;malley ?
oh , uh , no , sir .
a buddy of mine in 4451,
lloyd mackie
give him whatever he needs
yes , sir .
mr. mackie ...
no smoking !
there &apos;s no smoking .
why not ?
oh , my god ... you &apos;re in a hospital !
your point being ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve listened
to the surgeon general lately say ,
in the past 20 years ,
but smoking is bad . smoking will kill you .
liver cancer will kill me .
smoking will just speed up the process .
you &apos;re at the top of the donor list for a new liver .
there &apos;s hope .
sweetheart , i &apos;ve been at the top of the list for ...
... eight months .
i &apos;m not in a batter &apos;s cage .
i &apos;m in a dugout , about to be traded .
you like baseball ?
no .
well , the chief wanted me to look in on you .
richard &apos;s a dear old friend .
he &apos;s been my doctor for 30 years .
well , whatever you need , i &apos;m your man .
just name it .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll think of something .
absent corneal reflexes .
it &apos;s been 55 minutes .
if he doesn &apos;t respond to tests in the next five hours ,
what ?
we suppose to just stand here and watch him die ?
if he doesn &apos;t respond to tests ,
it &apos;s because he &apos;s already dead .
technically . legally .
actually , izzie . actually dead .
he &apos;s breathing . he has heart beat
look at his eeg .
there &apos;s no higher @-@ brain function .
he &apos;ll never talk , move or think again .
there &apos;s no one in there .
think like a doctor , izzie .
he could wake up .
what about a miracle ?
there are medical miracles , you know .
i know . you &apos;re right , miracles happen .
people do wake up .
that &apos;s why we do a series of tests over a number of hours .
so when we call time of death ,
we know that we &apos;ve done everything to make sure
it &apos;s actually his time of death .
that there isn &apos;t gonna be any miracles .
this is the hard part .
to stand around as surgeons and not cut .
that &apos;s what &quot; do no harm &quot; means .
i wish he &apos;d just go into the light
already so i can get on another case .
oh , i &apos;m the devil because i &apos;d rather be in surgery
instead of standing watch over the death squad ?
it &apos;s depressing .
look at his sneakers . they &apos;re brand @-@ new .
and somebody sewed this tear in his shirt .
and he has one of those electronic key cards .
he belongs to someone .
an hour ago , he was out there , alive .
to simply stand here and wait for him to die ...
it would be a waste of life .
exactly .
it &apos;d be a waste of organs .
ahh . you &apos;ve got a nice touch .
and , by the way , you are a rockin &apos; babe .
seriously , do you actually think you have a shot here ?
i &apos;d like to think i &apos;ve got a shot anywhere .
look , you really have to let me take you for some tests .
you could have internal bleeding .
no , thank you , i &apos;ve got a race to get back to .
why ? you can &apos;t win now , anyway .
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t cross that finish line .
there &apos;s a party at the finish line .
do you want to meet me there ?
one test. a ct . i &apos;ll have you out of here in an hour .
i can &apos;t do it . got to go .
well , you realize you &apos;re leaving against medical advice ,
and that i strongly urge you to stay .
the frat guy said i could go .
the frat guy is an ass .
ok , well , you have to sign an ama form .
darling , i will do anything you want me to .
what is it with you guys
and your need to dirty everything up ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe it &apos;s just testosterone , eh ?
maybe .
you might want to see a doctor about that too .
come here .
that was for good luck .
don &apos;t worry , darling , you &apos;ll see me again .
for your sake , i hope not .
what do you want ?
you make out with patients now ?
what , are you jealous ?
i don &apos;t get jealous .
we had sex , once .
and we kissed in an elevator .
and we kissed in an elevator , once .
no , seriously . go out with me .
no .
you know , i almost died today .
yeah , i came , like , this close .
how would you feel if i died
and you didn &apos;t get a chance to go out with me ?
get over yourself , already .
come on .
it &apos;s the chase , isn &apos;t it ?
what ?
the thrill of the chase .
i &apos;ve been wondering to myself ,
&quot; why are you so hell @-@ bent on getting me to go out with you ? &quot;
you know you &apos;re my boss , you know it &apos;s against the rules ,
you know i keep saying no . it &apos;s the chase .
well , it &apos;s fun , isn &apos;t it ?
you see ? this is a game to you .
but not to me .
because , unlike you , i still have something to prove .
i know you see me resecting this bowel .
do i strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking ?
we have a john doe . in three hours , we have to declare him .
we want to harvest his organs .
why are you wasting time on this ?
you know how many patients we have downstairs .
if he dies , and he could still live ,
his death should mean something .
and you want a harvest surgery .
i want to save lives .
ok , i want a harvest surgery .
getting organs from a john doe is a long shot .
without id , you can &apos;t contact the family .
without the family , you can &apos;t get consent to harvest organ .
let the poor man die in peace .
what if we can find the family ?
and get consent .
we could harvest the organs ?
if you find the family .
what are you doing ?
hiding .
there &apos;s this vip patient ...
he likes me .
that &apos;s good , right ?
he &quot; likes me , &quot; likes me .
go for it , man . get yours . i &apos;m down with the rainbow .
oh . are you not gay ?
no .
really ?
dude , sorry .
uh , cristina ?
do you ? do you think ?
does meredith think i &apos;m gay ?
are you ?
no .
really ?
hey , i found this on our john doe .
it &apos;s a hotel key card .
the police are going to send someone over , figure out
what hotel he was staying at , get his id from there .
i &apos;ll make sure the police get it .
it &apos;s really important .
we only have a few hours before we have to declare him ,
and i &apos;d really like to find his family .
you want their permission for organ donation ?
i just ... really want to find them .
you have a potential donor ?
what &apos;s his blood type ?
uh , o @-@ neg .
ok .
i know you probably can &apos;t hear me ,
and you &apos;re feeling this big push to go towards the light ,
where everything &apos;s all halos
and all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffets and stuff .
and , i mean , sharing your organs is really great and all .
but i think you have a family .
i can feel it .
so i think it &apos;d be really great
if you could do me a favor , and ... get better .
just ...
... live .
so , you think you can give that a shot for me ?
oh , no .
meredith !
meredith . he &apos;s crashing .
what ?
what are you doing ? call a code !
i can &apos;t , i &apos;m not supposed to . he &apos;s brain @-@ dead .
if he &apos;s brain @-@ dead , you have to let him go .
no . it &apos;s only been five hours and 33 minutes .
he &apos;s supposed to get six hours .
we can &apos;t do anything . it &apos;s not our place to make that call .
he &apos;s a person . we &apos;re doctors .
we should have every right to make that call .
we can &apos;t just stand here and do nothing while he dies .
he has a right to the next 27 minutes .
screw it .
i &apos;ll get the dopamine . you get the blood
we &apos;ll transfuse him .
do you feel any pain here ?
no .
you know , you really do have ...
... beautiful eyelashes .
um ... thank you . uh , what about here ?
no . and nice eyes .
kind .
i like a man with kind eyes .
really ? you think i have kind eyes ?
i mean , uh ... you can , um ...
what are you examining me for ?
oh , you know , just routine medical stuff .
you &apos;re doing very well .
because i &apos;m enjoying the view .
ok . well ... i gotta go .
he &apos;s stable .
for now , i had a radiologist look at his chest .
he has a traumatic aortic injury .
he &apos;s gonna rupture and bleed out .
he needs surgery .
if he &apos;s gonna remain an organ donor .
if he &apos;s gonna live .
izzie ...
no , i &apos;m not giving up on him .
he has surgery , he lives longer . that &apos;s the point .
i &apos;m going to find the family . you get him into surgery .
she &apos;s vice president of fantasyland .
so who do we go to for the surgery . bailey ?
we need to go higher than bailey .
dr. burke .
hello !
ok .
dr. burke , um , i know you &apos;re busy ,
but our john doe needs an aortic repair .
the guy from this morning ?
isn &apos;t he legally dead ?
well , yeah ... he &apos;s kinda still around .
we gave him two units prvcs and put him on pressors .
on whose orders ?
mine .
you get a brain @-@ dead john doe a blood transfusion
without consulting anyone .
and now you want me to repair his heart ?
well , yes .
you do enjoy crossing the line , don &apos;t you ?
he is an excellent candidate for organ donation .
i am a surgeon . i save lives .
this guy is already dead .
now , this is the men &apos;s room .
either whip one out , or close the door .
you &apos;re asking my advice ?
yes .
now who &apos;s chasing ?
not funny . this is important .
ok .
you want to get around burke ?
you gotta find a way to get the chief involved .
what &apos;d i do ?
how close a match for the liver is your guy to our john doe ?
very . same type , same size .
couldn &apos;t find a better match . why ?
he &apos;s the chief &apos;s vip , right ?
right .
how much would you kill to be in on the transplant surgery ?
you underestimate me .
i &apos;m not a baby . i &apos;m your colleague .
you don &apos;t have to manipulate me .
if you want something , all you have to do is ask .
we want you to go over burke &apos;s head , to the chief .
ask me something easier .
sir .
o &apos;malley. how &apos;s mackie ?
fine .
actually , that &apos;s what i want to talk to you about .
i kinda think that ... me and the other interns .
o &apos;malley , i &apos;m not getting any younger .
we found mackie a liver .
we are so going to hell .
burke is sending us to hell .
on an express train .
if it works .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
yes !
oh , crap .
dr. burke ! dr. burke !
excellent work , sir .
excellent .
flawless .
it &apos;s a shame he &apos;s brain @-@ dead .
if he wasn &apos;t , he would be on his feet in a few days .
i &apos;m amazed at what &apos;s going on .
i seriously hate that guy .
alex is vermin . that surgery is ours .
at least burke is doing the surgery .
i don &apos;t care about alex .
george , you did good .
i &apos;m gonna have to dodge burke for the rest of my career .
he could kill me and make it look like an accident .
the police called . they &apos;ve identified your john doe .
his wife is on the way .
oh , my god .
kevin !
it &apos;s ok .
oh , my god !
mrs. davidson , this is dr. stevens .
now , if you have any questions at all , please call me .
is there ?
is there still a chance ?
we can hold off till morning ,
but if there &apos;s still no change , we &apos;d ...
we &apos;d like to talk to you about organ donation .
mackie ?
how are we treating ya ?
oh , fine .
except that beautiful boy won &apos;t let me smoke .
you should reprimand him .
make him change bedpans .
mackie .
that beautiful boy may have found you a liver .
god , i smell good !
you know what it is ?
it &apos;s the smell of open @-@ heart surgery .
it &apos;s awesome . it is awesome .
you gotta smell me .
i don &apos;t want to smell you .
oh , yes you do .
you have got to be kidding me !
ok , i have more important things to deal with than you .
i have roommates , boy problems and family problems .
wanna act like a frat @-@ boy bitch ? that &apos;s fine .
you wanna take credit for your saves ,
and everybody else &apos;s ? that &apos;s fine too .
just stay outta my face .
and for the record , you smell like crap !
she attacked me .
meredith ! meredith !
meredith ! meredith !
you might want to leave before i change my mind ,
and let her beat you to a pulp with her tiny and professional fists .
what ?
nothing .
it &apos;s just ...
nothing .
oh ! this one is skin grafting !
skin grafting ? no way ! i &apos;ve never seen that done .
are those my mother &apos;s surgical tapes ?
we should watch the skin grafting one first .
where did all this stuff come from ?
oh . i unpacked some of your mother &apos;s things .
i was upset .
and when i &apos;m upset , i like to nest .
oh ... hemipelvectomy !
i think we should watch this one first .
no .
we &apos;re not watching my mother &apos;s surgery tapes .
we &apos;re not unpacking boxes .
we &apos;re not having long conversations where
we celebrate the moments of our lives !
and use a coaster !
i ordered chinese food .
i hate chinese food !
they &apos;re everywhere . all the time .
izzie &apos;s perky , and george does this thing
where he &apos;s helpful and considerate .
they share food , and they say things ,
and they move things and they breathe .
ugh . they &apos;re , like , happy .
kick them out .
i can &apos;t kick them out . they just moved in .
i asked them to move in .
so you &apos;re gonna repress everything in some deep twisted place
until , one day , you snap and kill them ?
yep .
this is why we are friends .
why is the nazi making us stay in the pit two days in a row ?
leftovers .
leftovers .
gotta get the cyclists who were too drunk , stupid or scared
to get themselves to hospital yesterday .
anyway , she gets to do a freakin &apos; organ harvest .
kills you , doesn &apos;t it ?
what ?
two women caught the harvest .
no , it kills me that anybody got the harvest but me .
boobs do not factor into this equation .
unless , uh , you want to show me yours .
i &apos;m gonna become a lesbian .
me too .
now , mrs. davidson , this form simply says
you consent to the donation of your husband &apos;s major organs .
heart , lungs , liver and kidneys .
now , i need to ask you a few questions .
are you willing to donate his corneas ?
you want his eyes ?
um , corneal transplants can give someone back their sight .
i suppose that &apos;s ok .
what about his skin ?
what ?
it &apos;s used to help burn victims .
you want to cut off his skin ?
what about the funeral ?
you want me to have a funeral and have people look at him ...
have his daughter look at her father and he doesn &apos;t have any skin ?
it &apos;s his skin !
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not a people person .
no kidding .
i can &apos;t do that . i can &apos;t talk to the family of the patient , i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s his name ?
who ?
the patient . what &apos;s his name ?
kevin davidson .
remember that .
not &quot; gorked guy . &quot; not &quot; john doe . &quot; kevin davidson .
he &apos;s someone &apos;s husband , someone &apos;s son ,
not a collection of body parts for you to harvest .
a person .
now , no one said this was easy .
i owe you , george .
no , you don &apos;t owe me anything .
i &apos;m just happy we found a liver .
well , when i get out of here ,
how about i take you and my new liver out for a night of the town ?
what do you say ?
uh , mr. mackie , no offense or anything .
you &apos;re very handsome , but , i , um , i &apos;m not ...
i mean , you &apos;re not my type because ...
you &apos;re a man , and ...
george , i never thought you were gay .
you didn &apos;t ?
oh , child , please. you ? gay ?
i &apos;m sick , george , not blind .
but then , why have ?
because dying is a &quot; get out of jail free &quot; card .
i can be as bold as i want ,
and there &apos;s nothing anybody can say about it .
so i flirt .
haven &apos;t you been attracted to someone
you know you couldn &apos;t have ?
well ...
i &apos;m ...
no .
what &apos;s her name ?
there &apos;s no ...
i &apos;m not ...
you know ...
this is really ...
... not ...
meredith .
meredith .
to be young and in love .
let &apos;s go get that liver , shall we ?
no , i &apos;m sorry , i ...
i didn &apos;t ...
i never liked harvesting .
why ?
like i said , i &apos;m a surgeon . i save lives .
this ends one .
i know you tried , so no hard feelings , ok .
i was just ...
you were saying goodbye .
what &apos;s viper doing here ?
probably crashed his bike , again .
how long has he been waiting ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve been busy on real cases .
he &apos;s all yours .
viper .
viper ?
are you ok ?
viper !
call the o.r , tell them we &apos;re coming ,
and page dr. bailey .
alex , let &apos;s go .
alex , push the damn gurney !
clear the way . coming through .
somebody gets the elevator .
i don &apos;t know how long i can keep this wound closed .
move faster . damn it !
this a new one ?
somebody get her off my patient .
meredith , get cleaned up and alex , get back down .
yeah , but i helped .
they tell me down in the pit , you just wanna take the hot case .
every pack of interns , there &apos;s always one fool
running around trying to show off .
and , alex , this time that fool is you . get out .
get me something to stand on . lower this table .
the mountain is gonna have to come to me .
count backwards from ten for me .
richard .
you &apos;re a good friend .
the best .
shut up and count backwards already , mack .
ten ...
nine ...
eight ...
seven ...
i &apos;m not gonna stay .
it &apos;s your job . you have to .
you &apos;re better at this part than me .
i don &apos;t wanna watch him get taken apart .
look at the vultures ... waiting to pick him clean .
every last one of them represents someone somewhere
who &apos;s gonna live because of kevin .
here . put it on .
i &apos;ll be waiting next door when you &apos;re ready .
everyone &apos;s waiting .
ok , doctors , let &apos;s get this over with .
izzie ?
i &apos;m gonna sew him up , for his family .
you do it .
what ?
you do it .
mrs. davidson .
he &apos;s ready , if you &apos;d like to see him .
this lovely group &apos;s his friends .
uh , you all belong to ... what &apos;s his name ?
viper .
v ... viper .
yeah , we were in the race .
how is he ? is he ok ?
is he ok ?
no . no , he &apos;s not ok at all .
he hurled his body down a concrete mountain
at full speed for no good reason .
yeah , i know you all pierce yourselves , smoke up
and generally treat your bodies
like your grungy asses can &apos;t break down . that &apos;s fine .
you want to kill yourselves flying down a concrete mountain ,
go to it . but there are other people walking , people driving .
people trying to live their lives on that concrete mountain .
one of them got his brains scrambled &apos; cause
one of you little sniveling no @-@ good snot rags ...
dr. bailey .
yeah , so. ok , no .
your friend , viper , as far as i &apos;m concerned , is not ok .
she &apos;s , um ...
... really tired .
but ...
... viper &apos;s gonna make it. he &apos;s gonna live .
thanks .
thanks .
it &apos;s not the chase .
what ?
you and me .
it is not the thrill of the chase .
it &apos;s not a game .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s your tiny , ineffectual fists .
and your hair .
my hair ?
it smells good .
and you &apos;re very , very bossy .
keeps me in line .
i &apos;m still not going out with you .
you say that now .
how &apos;d it go ?
very smoothly .
damn .
that means i &apos;m gonna have to quit smoking .
ah , the pretty ones always come crawling back .
there &apos;s another way to survive this competition .
a way no one ever seems to tell you about .
one you have to learn for yourself . no.5
it &apos;s not about the race at all .
there are no winners or losers .
victories are counted by the number of lives saved .
oh , ok. this is the best part . watch .
she pulls the flap of skin down over the face .
we were ...
hi .
we were ... we were just , uh ...
cristina made us .
and , once in a while , if you &apos;re smart ,
the life you save could be your own .
what are we watching ?
ooh . this is the one where my mother ...
literally pulls this guy &apos;s face off .
yeah .
oh , come on !
holy crap !
