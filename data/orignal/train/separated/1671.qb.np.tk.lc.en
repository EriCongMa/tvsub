okay in avatar when they have sex in pandora
they hook up their ponytails , so we know their ponytails
are like their junk .
yeah ... so ?
so , when they ride horses and fly on the birds ,
they also use their ponytails .
what &apos;s your point ?
my point is , if i were a horse or a bird ,
i &apos;d be very nervous around james cameron .
it amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details
when there are more important things in the real world to worry about .
for example , why wasn &apos;t william shatner in the new star trek movie ?
hey , sheldon . i was up in the administration office ,
and i happened to overhear the name of the winner
of this year &apos;s chancellor &apos;s award for science .
and you want to rub my nose in the fact
that my contributions are being overlooked again ?
i am the william shatner of theoretical physics .
all right , i &apos;ll play .
what self @-@ important , preening fraud are they honoring this year ?
oh , i &apos;m so glad you asked it like that . you .
i won ?
you won .
i won !
this is astonishing .
not that i won the award-- no one deserves it more .
actually , i guess i misspoke . it &apos;s not astonishing ; more like inevitable .
i &apos;m not sure what to do first . maybe i should call my mother .
wait ! i know-- i &apos;m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online .
well , good for him .
yeah , the one thing the william shatner
of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost .
didn &apos;t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull ?
no .
hey , you didn &apos;t want a slurpee at 7 @-@ eleven , you don &apos;t get glasses .
oh , that will be another congratulatory call for me .
uh , mute , please .
wait , wait . hang on-- flaming arrow .
hello ?
oh , chancellor morton , how are you , sir ?
yes , i was expecting your call . three years ago .
i see .
wait . what happens if i choose not to give a speech ?
uh @-@ huh .
and if i don &apos;t want to forfeit the award ?
well , you &apos;ve got that tied up in a neat little bow .
all right .
thank you .
problem .
what ?
they expect me to give a speech at the banquet .
i can &apos;t give a speech .
well , no , you &apos;re mistaken . you give speeches all the time .
what you can &apos;t do is shut up .
yeah , before the movie ,
you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown .
it turned brown while you were talking .
i am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups .
i cannot speak to large crowds .
what , to you , is a large crowd ?
any group big enough to trample me to death .
general rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children .
sheldon , congratulations .
brought you a cheesecake from work .
you know , &apos; cause of your award ,
not because a busboy sneezed on it .
i &apos;m not accepting the award .
why not ?
turns out the great sheldon cooper has stage fright .
that &apos;s no reason to back out .
you know , i once got a pretty big honor in high school ,
and i was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd ,
but i went through with it , and you know what ?
the world looked pretty darn good
sitting on a haystack in the back of a ford f @-@ 150
as a member of the corn queen &apos;s court .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;ll bear that in mind
if i &apos;m ever nominated for the hillbilly peace prize .
sheldon , you &apos;re being ridiculous .
am i ?
let me tell you a story .
where &apos;s 70 children when you need them ?
i was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college .
&quot; summa cum laude &quot; is latin for &quot; with highest honors . &quot;
i just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks .
i was valedictorian and expected to give an address .
even now , i can remember that moment
when i walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd .
there must have been thousands of people .
my heart started pounding in my chest .
i began to hyperventilate .
my vision became blurry , and before i knew it ...
oh , dear .
oh , my god .
sheldon ?
sheldon , are you okay ?
don &apos;t trample me .
come on , mother .
you know why i can &apos;t accept the award .
with all due respect , i don &apos;t think praying will help .
no , i have not heard the song , &quot; jesus , take the wheel . &quot;
no , no ... you don &apos;t need to start singing it .
yes , i &apos;ll buy it on the itunes , mother .
good @-@ bye , mother .
hello .
sit down . we want to talk to you .
am i in trouble ?
did my mother call you ?
just sit .
we think we can help you with your stage fright .
oh , i doubt that .
i haven &apos;t figured out a way , and i &apos;m much smarter than all of you .
yes , but you &apos;re not smarter than all of us put together .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . that is what i meant .
okay . your problem is , you &apos;re trying to do this all by yourself .
we can help you . we can be your team .
like , uh , professor xavier and his x @-@ men .
i do like the x @-@ men .
did i see x @-@ men ?
yeah , we watched it last week . you said you liked it .
oh . i say a lot of things , sweetie .
so , how about it , sheldon ?
i don &apos;t know .
if you &apos;re my x @-@ men , what are your powers ?
okay . well , i am going to take you shopping , get you a nice suit .
might give you more confidence .
that &apos;s not exactly a mutation that would get you
into xavier &apos;s school for gifted youngsters ,
but go on .
leonard ?
i thought i could try to analyze you
and get to the root of your anxiety .
what qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind ?
my mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist ,
and i &apos;ve been in therapy ever since she accused me
of breast @-@ feeding codependently .
raj says he can teach you ...
what did you call it ?
i don &apos;t know-- some indian meditation crap .
i see . well , i assume , since the rest of you have set the bar so low ,
you &apos;re saving the most impressive contribution for last .
go ahead , howard . dazzle me .
my power is the ability to pretend
like i give a damn about your piddily @-@ ass problems .
and that &apos;s 24 @-@ seven , buddy .
and i appreciate the pretense .
so , what do you say , sheldon ?
are we your x @-@ men ?
no .
the x @-@ men were named for the &quot; x &quot; in charles xavier .
since i am sheldon cooper , you will be my c @-@ men .
oh , that &apos;s not a good name .
okay , sheldon . i &apos;m going to be leading you
through a series of meditation exercises .
these methods come from the ancient gurus of india
and have helped me overcome my own fears .
and yet , you can &apos;t speak to women .
true , but thanks to meditation , i am able to stay
in the same room with them without urinating .
now ... close your eyes .
okay , but don &apos;t punch me .
what ?
when i was little , my sister would say to me ,
&quot; close your eyes , you &apos;ll get a surprise , &quot;
and then she &apos;d punch me .
i &apos;m not going to punch you .
that &apos;s what my sister used to say .
do you want to do this or not ?
i &apos;m sorry . proceed .
all right .
imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home .
where is that ?
sim city .
more specifically , the sim city i designed--
sheldonopolis .
okay , you &apos;re in sheldonopolis .
where exactly ?
sheldon square ? sheldon towers ?
sheldon stadium , home of the fighting sheldons ?
whatever you like .
i thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation .
fine . you &apos;re in sheldon square .
really ? this time of year ?
it &apos;s a bit nippy .
then , put on a sweater .
suppose i could run downtown
and pick up something at shel @-@ mart .
yeah , whatever . just go buy a sweater .
you know , the nice thing about shel @-@ mart is i own it ,
so i get a 15 % discount .
you own the damn thing . just take a freaking sweater !
look , i didn &apos;t turn a profit last quarter
by taking product off the shelves willy @-@ nilly .
all right .
you &apos;ve paid for a sweater , and you &apos;re in sheldon square .
hang on .
it &apos;s a cardigan . i have to button it .
oh , no .
what now ?
a godzilla @-@ like monster is approaching the city .
i have to get my people to safety .
people of sheldonopolis , this is your mayor .
follow me .
if the children can &apos;t run , leave them behind .
oh , the simulated horror !
raj ?
just as i suspected .
meditation is nothing but hokum .
i question your premise .
how is a new suit going to prevent me
from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people ?
it &apos;ll give you confidence .
you know , sometimes when i &apos;m feeling all stressed out
about something , i go out and buy a cute top
or a fun skirt and i have a whole new outlook on life .
don &apos;t you eventually realize you &apos;re just the same stressed out person
in a cute top or a fun skirt ?
yeah , that &apos;s when i buy shoes .
now , let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve got .
this is nice .
it &apos;s only one color .
yeah , so ?
that &apos;s a lot of money for only one color .
fine .
why don &apos;t you pick out what you like .
this is pretty sharp .
no . you &apos;re wrong .
this is great .
i had a suit like this when i was six .
okay , i think we have a winner .
where the hell &apos;d you find that ?
in the prom department .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
says the former member of the corn queen &apos;s court .
please just try this one on .
okay . but anything i put on now is only going to suffer in comparison .
this is absurd . i look like a clown .
so , sheldon ...
... how you doing ?
that &apos;s how you start a psychotherapy session ?
&quot; how am i doing ? &quot;
i was promised a riverboat journey
into the jungles of my subconscious .
instead , i get the same question i hear
from the lady who slices my bologna at ralph &apos;s .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ll start again .
would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dreams ?
um , i don &apos;t know , maybe .
i recently had a dream that i was a giant .
but everything around me was to scale ,
so it all looked normal .
how did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale ?
i was wearing size a million pants .
why don &apos;t we just talk ?
the talking cure . classical freudian . good choice .
if it will help speed things along ,
uh , my answers to the standard rorschach ink blot test are :
a ) a bat , b ) a bat , c ) a bat ,
and d ) my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle .
why don &apos;t i just start ?
sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades
if , on a subconscious level , they don &apos;t feel they deserve them .
do you think maybe that &apos;s what &apos;s happening here ?
really , leonard ?
you &apos;re just going to try to recycle adler &apos;s doctrine
of the inferiority complex ?
i could probably get that from the woman at ralph &apos;s .
and she &apos;d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free .
but it could be part of your problem .
let me give you an example .
when i was eight ,
i won a ribbon at the science fair
for my project , &quot; do lima beans grow better to classical music . &quot;
but my mother pointed out
that it was just a rehash of my brother &apos;s earlier
&quot; do lima beans grow worse to rock &apos; n &apos; roll . &quot;
i felt so guilty , i gave the ribbon back .
and how did that make you feel ?
terrible .
i worked really hard on that project .
i stayed up all night singing the clown &apos;s aria from pagliacci
to a lima bean sprout .
go on .
it wasn &apos;t my fault .
i had never seen my brother &apos;s project .
and my mother could &apos;ve told me before
instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone .
so , i hear you saying you &apos;re angry with your mother .
damn right , i &apos;m angry with my mother .
for god &apos;s sake , i was eight years old .
she humiliated me .
that &apos;s when the bed @-@ wetting started again .
thank you , leonard .
for what ?
if someone as damaged as you
can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning ,
i think i can face a simple award ceremony .
wait , that &apos;s it ? i thought we had a whole hour !
good evening , ladies and gentlemen . my name is dr. leonard hofstadter ,
and it is my very great honor to introduce
the winner of this year &apos;s chancellor &apos;s award for science
and my good friend , dr. sheldon cooper .
but before i do ,
i &apos;d like to share with you a letter from sheldon &apos;s mother ,
who couldn &apos;t be here tonight .
isn &apos;t that nice ? his mother sent him a letter .
she &apos;s proud of him . i wonder what that feels like ...
&quot; dear shelly . &quot; that &apos;s what she calls him . shelly-- it &apos;s a pet name .
you know what my mother &apos;s pet name for me is ? leonard .
but i digress .
&quot; dear shelly ... &quot;
oh , dear .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i &apos;m getting dizzy .
don &apos;t worry .
you &apos;re surrounded by your c @-@ men .
i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m going to faint .
here , drink this.it &apos;ll relax you .
alcohol ?
i don &apos;t drink alcohol .
fine , faint .
i don &apos;t feel different.this alcohol is defective .
here , see if this one works .
first of all , the projects were totally different .
i was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans
and makes them grow , but my mother didn &apos;t hear me .
if you &apos;d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth ,
i &apos;d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me .
i &apos;m ready .
right .
ladies and gentlemen , our guest of honor dr. sheldon cooper .
thanks , shorty , i &apos;ll take it from here .
all right , you people ready to have some fun ?
you have a basic understanding of differential calculus
and at least one year of algebraic topology ?
well , then here come the jokes .
why did the chicken cross the mobius strip ?
to get to the same side-- bazinga !
all right , a neutron walks into a bar and asks , &quot; how much for a drink ? &quot;
the bartender says , &quot; for you , no charge . &quot;
hello ?
i know you &apos;re out there .
i can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide .
looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience .
dr. randall from the geology department--
only man who &apos;s happy when they take his work for granite .
ba @-@ da cha !
i kid the geologists , of course ,
but it &apos;s only &apos; cause i have no respect for the field .
let &apos;s get serious for a moment .
why are we all here ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re scientists .
and what do scientists study ?
the universe .
and what &apos;s the universe made of ?
i am so glad you asked .
there &apos;s antimony , arsenic , aluminum , selenium
and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium
and nickel , neodymium , neptunium , germanium
everybody !
and iron , americium
ruthenium , uranium , europium , zirconium ,
lutetium , vanadium
just the asians !
and lanthanum and osmium
and astatine and radium ...
penny , leonard .
would you be able to answer some questions
i &apos;m having about the events of last night ?
sure .
question one ...
where are my pants ?
you might want to check youtube .
what do i search ?
it &apos;s already loaded . just hit play .
all right , people , let &apos;s get down to the math .
it is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination .
can i take my pants off over my head ?
of course not .
my body &apos;s in the way .
but if we had access to higher dimensions ,
we could move our pants around our bodies
through the fourth dimension
and our days of dropping trousers would be over .
oh , lord ...
this couldn &apos;t be any more humiliating .
give it a minute .
now , for the astronomers in the audience ,
get ready to see the dark side of the moon .
