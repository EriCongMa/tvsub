heard it was a police officer .
he was a hpd solo bike officer
who &apos;s on funeral detail , officer keoki .
ben keoki ?
i think so .
what , you know him ?
ben lived in the corner house on my block .
he and my dad were very close .
he was basically an uncle to me .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
with keoki , the job was never about ego .
i don &apos;t think he ever took a promotional exam .
he just wanted to be a good cop .
sounds like he was a solid guy .
yeah .
what &apos;d you find ?
look at this .
tripod imprint , dirt &apos;s been disturbed ,
boot impressions .
i &apos;d say this was the sniper &apos;s hide site .
kono ...
do we know whose funeral it was ?
i mean , maybe this guy &apos;s got a beef with the family ,
and keoki just gets hit by a stray .
i don &apos;t think so .
i found this in the area where our guy took his shot .
the shooter engraved a bullet casing with keoki &apos;s name on it .
what kind of sick bastard shoots a cop in cold blood ?
somebody with a serious grudge .
when we rode together , keoki never wanted to drive .
he always had me take the wheel .
he said he couldn &apos;t focus on what was happening
on the streets if he had to worry about traffic lights .
ben had me fooled .
how &apos;s that ?
we were partners for two years
before i figured out he couldn &apos;t drive .
i found out he got his cousin at the dmv
to issue him a license without having
to take the driving portion of the test .
it was your father
that taught him how to drive on weekends .
motorcycles , too ,
when he decided he wanted to be a motor officer .
imagine that ...
ben managing to get into the academy
and onto the force
without the ability to drive a car .
that &apos;s how much he wanted to be a cop .
keoki ever have any run @-@ ins ?
you think this was a revenge hit ?
maybe . we have to look at every angle .
we pushed it hard back then ,
shook a lot of people , made a ton of arrests ,
but we were just street cops ;
domestics , drug pops .
take your time .
oh , believe me ,
i know i shouldn &apos;t say this , commander ,
but if i knew who was responsible ,
i &apos;d get him myself .
i get it . we all feel it .
something like this , we all feel it .
i &apos;m old school .
you hurt one of mine , i hurt you back .
troy , i &apos;m gonna ask you a question ,
all right ?
did ben ever have any money troubles ?
could he have borrowed from the wrong people ?
ben didn &apos;t have a hell of a lot , but he didn &apos;t owe anybody .
keoki had too much pride to take a loan from anyone .
all right , troy , listen to me , all right ?
we &apos;re gonna get this guy ,
understand me ? but until we do ,
i need you to stand down and let us handle it .
you remind me a lot of your old man , steve .
i trusted him , i trust you .
from these aerial shots of the cemetery ,
you can see our shooter took a position of advantage with
maximum cover and just waited for the procession to pull in .
so this guy &apos;s a pro .
he must &apos;ve scouted this kill site days before .
it was a hell of a shot .
bull &apos;s @-@ eye from almost 200 yards away .
why kill him in a public place like a cemetery ?
&apos;cause he wanted the headlines .
so who is this guy ? mob ? military ?
chin , contact the fbi .
have them pull intel
on all known
suspects with a similar mo .
yeah .
should also check keoki &apos;s past arrest stats .
maybe this is a parolee who &apos;s got a grudge
who was just recently discharged .
you think he &apos;s gonna kill again ?
this is the sniper &apos;s personal calling card , okay ?
the fact that he left this tells me two things :
first of all , he &apos;s claiming full responsibility for this ,
second of all , he &apos;s getting off on it , okay ?
so the question is not whether he &apos;s gonna kill again .
the question is how many people are on the list ?
fong , get any prints off that rifle casing ?
nothing .
either the sniper wiped it down
before he left the cemetery , or he was wearing gloves .
here , take a look at this .
found something interesting about the engraving .
the lettering is slightly irregular ,
which means it was done by hand ,
and not by some locked @-@ off engraving machine .
probably using something like this .
okay , so he &apos;s old school .
how do we i.d. him ?
well , the lettering is pretty distinct .
most people write the letter &quot; o &quot; top to bottom like this .
which you can tell by the intersecting lines at the top .
right . but in the case of our shooter ...
his &quot; o &quot; is written from bottom to top .
that &apos;s what we call a &quot; unique identifier . &quot;
i &apos;m running the sample through
the fbi ransom and demands database
for a possible match to other similar criminal cases ,
but it &apos;s gonna take some time .
how long ? it could take days .
charlie , we don &apos;t have that kind of time .
someone &apos;s out there killing cops .
better lead ...
might be the casing itself .
kono , that specific caliber rifle is used
in hundreds of different weapons .
true . but this doesn &apos;t look like your typical bullet casing .
this thing is highly polished . it looks like it &apos;s had some
aftermarket modifications to its coloring .
so what does that tell us ?
that the shooter really knows
his ammo and his physics .
any alteration will affect not only
how the cartridge fits into the firing chamber ,
but its flight path , as well .
it &apos;s very specific . it &apos;s engineered .
so i &apos;m thinking i need to find a gunsmith
that specializes in custom loads .
you trying to put me out of a job , kono ?
and , what , miss seeing you smile ?
no way .
thanks a lot , charlie . see you around .
happy i could help .
you a cop ?
because by law , you got to tell me if i ask .
i &apos;m not a cop .
that &apos;s exactly what i would say .
if i was a cop .
we going to do this , or not ?
i &apos;m here , right ?
that &apos;s it ?
a rifle ?
that &apos;d be a great idea if
i was hunting bear in montana .
i was told you wanted something untraceable and something fast .
fast and untraceable does not mean
some assembly will be required .
well , this is all i got .
it &apos;s supposed to be for my protection .
how am i supposed to protect myself or my product
and i can &apos;t even put that up under my shirt ?
this is better . this eliminates the threats
before they make it through your door .
yeah , but it creates a lot of exposure .
well , maybe you don &apos;t want to play with big @-@ boy weapons .
i &apos;ll take it .
watch closely how i put it together .
damn , what the hell happened to your hands ?
i cut myself shaving .
now pay attention .
pull the receiver out of the case .
flip the stock open until it clicks .
line up the barrel .
gas tube in the hole .
put the hand guard on top of the barrel .
push the pin through .
pull the lever over the pin .
take the clip ...
and then ...
then it &apos;s bang @-@ bang time .
bang , bang .
you all right ?
yeah .
keoki had a lot of friends , huh ?
yep . good men always do .
what about , uh , what about family ?
he got a big family ?
keoki &apos;s wife walked out on him when i was a kid .
ben , he was such an optimist , you know ,
he used to ... he used to set a place for her
at the dinner table every night .
even kept the porch light on in case
she changed her mind , you know . but , um ...
she never did .
she didn &apos;t come back .
they have kids ?
a daughter .
chelsea . she was , um ...
she was the same age as me .
we were pretty tight , actually , back then .
we should try to contact her , see what ...
she died four years ago . breast cancer .
i was deployed overseas when i heard , and ...
i was going to look keoki up when i came back .
you know what i mean , convey my condolences ,
make sure he was going okay ,
just check on him , you know ? but ...
time slips away , danny .
it just , it disappears and i ,
i don &apos;t know , i waited too long .
no , stop . please , okay .
you got busy . people get busy .
that is part of the job .
guaranteed , keoki knew that .
he also knew that you cared about him , okay ?
yeah .
kono , what do you got ?
hpd thinks they have the sniper &apos;s house pinned
over by ala moana park .
they &apos;re mobilizing now .
we got an anonymous call that keoki &apos;s killer
was hiding out at this address
and sitting on a huge stash of methamphetamine .
started shooting as soon as we arrived .
we clear the area ?
we &apos;re working on it .
we got an i.d. on this guy , or what ?
utilities come back to a guy named don mckinney .
came to the islands two years ago .
been nothing but trouble since .
this guy have any run @-@ ins with keoki ?
none that we &apos;re aware of .
that &apos;s what doesn &apos;t make sense .
hold your fire . hpd , hold your fire .
mckinney , this is lieutenant commander
steve mcgarrett ,
five @-@ o. throw your gun out .
excuse me , did you think that that was going to work or what ?
maybe he didn &apos;t hear me , okay ?
oh , yeah , maybe he didn &apos;t hear you .
mckinney , this is commander
steve mcgarrett , five @-@ o.
throw your gun out .
hey , hey , hey .
what , what ?
if you want to get shot , i &apos;ll shoot you .
hey , mckinney , you come out or we &apos;re coming in .
the door &apos;s wide open , cop !
what are you doing ?
what am i doing ? i &apos;m going to smoke him out .
okay , steve , stop . okay ?
swat is on their way , right now .
can we , please ,
please give them the professional courtesy that they deserve
and let them do their job ?
you done ?
i &apos;m done , why ?
cover me .
go , go !
cover .
hey .
what ?
you know the difference between cover and concealment ?
one hides you from bullets ,
the other hides you from sight .
here i have both .
yes , i know the difference between cover and concealment .
you do ? because right now ,
you the navy seal , you got neither .
i &apos;m making you no longer to speak !
what ? ! you can &apos;t mess with me !
hey , mckinney .
you okay ?
of course i &apos;m okay , because i took cover .
like any normal human being with a little bit of common sense
and training would have done .
that &apos;s a 308 drd paratus sniper rifle .
so , what , this uses the same caliber ammo
we found at our crime scene , right ?
right .
but , what ? you don &apos;t think this is our shooter .
this guy , he &apos;s a bottom @-@ feeder pushing ice to dope fiends .
besides , you saw him shoot .
he couldn &apos;t hit the side of a barn .
whoever took keoki out was a skilled sniper .
i got an officer down .
i need an ambulance , now !
mckinney must &apos;ve hit him .
troy , troy .
troy , hang on .
where &apos;s that ambulance ?
commander mcgarrett ?
may i speak with you for a moment ?
you find something ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
the shooting incident described by
sergeant lukela indicated that
the killer was shooting from ground level , correct ?
yeah , he was 25 yards away from the house ,
just in front of that black and white when he was hit .
well , then ...
my observations contradict that .
based on the entry and exit wounds of officer ookala ,
i can ascertain that he was shot from a higher angle ;
definitely not ground level .
okay , how high ?
higher than the window your suspect mckinney was shooting from .
so , mckinney didn &apos;t shoot him .
it appears not .
all right .
the shooter could &apos;ve got a sight line
from any one of these buildings around here .
right .
we need fong down here right away
to tell us where that bullet came from .
here &apos;s your point of origin .
the victim was standing right about here
when he was shot .
now i just need the trajectory of the victim &apos;s entrance wound .
i believe the bullet entered the victim &apos;s body
at a downward angle of 20 degrees .
20 degrees , got it .
the sniper took the shot from the corner of that rooftop .
ookala .
okay , so , our sniper must &apos;ve known
that he would &apos;ve been one of the uniforms to respond .
and he must &apos;ve been monitoring police frequencies
using a scanner .
it wouldn &apos;t have been too hard to figure out
which car ookala was assigned to .
we traced the 911 call
that tipped hpd to mckinney &apos;s place .
turns out it was a pre @-@ paid burner .
and , according to hpd narco ,
the chatter on the street was that
mckinney was in the market for a weapon .
we know why ?
one c.i. said that he wanted it for protection ,
&apos;cause two weeks ago he got rolled during an ice deal .
okay , so mckinney is desperately in need of a weapon ,
uh , our sniper gets wind of this , hooks him up ,
then he lures ookala here so he can put one in him .
we have to find a connection between our shooter ,
ookala and keoki .
it &apos;s the only way we &apos;re going to be able to protect
whoever else is on that list .
i &apos;ll get hpd to cross @-@ reference keoki and ookala &apos;s past cases
looking for anomalies .
it &apos;s gonna take some time .
these guy &apos;s got 25 years on the job .
that &apos;s a lot of cases .
those are just the cases where keoki and ookala
were the primary arresting officers .
if you factor the ones where they were backup ,
it would double that .
just have them put every available unit on this , okay ?
we can &apos;t waste anymore time .
this guy &apos;s running around out here killing cops .
mcgarrett .
yes , governor .
i &apos;ll be right there .
that was governor denning , he wants to be briefed .
he &apos;s holding a press conference in one hour .
and in two hours they &apos;re going to be chopping our heads off
because we haven &apos;t caught this guy .
what are you going to tell him ?
i &apos;m going to tell him that we positively i.d. &apos; d our sniper .
i &apos;m doing my level best to assure the bureau of tourism
that the situation &apos;s under control .
but you know the press .
no matter what i tell them ,
they &apos;re gonna embellish things .
i get that it &apos;s great for ratings ,
but it creates panic in my streets .
so to stop that , commander ,
is there anything positive that i can feed them ?
yeah , you tell &apos; em five @-@ o is bringing
every resource to bear on this case
and that an arrest is imminent .
is that true ?
not exactly , but you spread a bit of misinformation
about this guy over the airwaves ,
maybe he &apos;s gonna lay low .
a bluff ?
no , it &apos;s a tactical maneuver .
what i can tell you is that these murders are somehow tied
to the victims &apos; past .
but i need time to get an i.d. on this guy
before he strikes again .
i &apos;m worried about our actions moving forward .
look , i &apos;m totally aware that this shooter killed two of ours .
despite that , we still need
to approach this in a professional manner .
okay , so what &apos;s your concern , specifically ?
i &apos;m not gonna beat around the bush with you .
we all feel the loss of keoki and ookala .
but we need to follow procedure here .
everything by the book . in a manner of speaking ,
the whole world &apos;s watching .
this coward , he killed two good men
without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves .
hpd has lost two family members .
so , yes , sir , we &apos;re all adults here ,
but you can &apos;t expect the rank and file
not to feel anger about this .
i &apos;m not talking about hpd . i &apos;m talking about you .
two cops died today .
i don &apos;t want you making this personal .
with all due respect , governor ,
this guy didn &apos;t just kill two cops .
he killed my friends .
these are men that i grew up
and men that i respected .
i &apos;m sure he intends to kill a couple more .
so , in all honesty ,
i don &apos;t know how not to make it personal .
take a look .
i confirmed the engravings on both bullet casings
we found are an exact match .
the letters show the same type etching marks on each one .
what about results from the fbi &apos;s ransom and
demand database ?
they ran the handwriting . didn &apos;t get any hits .
okay , well , run it again .
anybody this maniacal must have been through
the system at least once .
one would think , but the fact is there are many things
that can alter someone &apos;s handwriting style :
arthritis , physical damage ,
or an intentional misdirect on the part of the suspect .
hey . the canvassing of the gun stores worked out .
hpd just got a call from a gunsmith
saying he sold the rifle casings
we found at the crime scenes .
thanks , fong .
all you need is a bed , right , babe ?
excuse me ?
a bed . a place to lay your keppie ,
and this would make the perfect apartment , no ?
what &apos;s your problem ? you don &apos;t like guns ?
you got one on your hip .
this is a necessity of the job , okay ,
but i do not love guns the way you love guns .
if purchased legally and used responsibly ,
they &apos;re a civilian &apos;s best friend .
i thought that was a dog .
they &apos;re better than dogs .
you get the physical protection ,
you don &apos;t have walk it , don &apos;t have to feed it .
you know , norm , i gotta tell you
you are everything i imagined
a gun shop owner would be .
and you &apos;re a nasty human being , you know that ?
i don &apos;t like to broadcast this , commander mcgarrett ,
but i &apos;ve been the captain of my neighborhood watch team
for the past 20 years .
so from one law enforcement officer to the next ...
you mean , from one delusional gun nut to two real cops .
you want my help or not ?
yes , of course we want your help , norm . just ignore him .
what did you say ? please .
the name written on the side of the casing ,
is it your shooter or the victim ?
let me get this one , please .
respectfully , if we had the shooter &apos;s name ,
we wouldn &apos;t need your help , would we ?
is he off his meds or does he always act this way ?
well , it &apos;s fine workmanship ,
i &apos;ll tell you that .
custom order is the only way to get these things .
it &apos;s a little fancy for my taste ,
but i can see the appeal .
all right , but you sell these , right ?
i sure do . special order ,
but so do a lot of other places on the mainland .
truth is , the guy you &apos;re looking for could &apos;ve bought &apos; em
from here or online .
all right . well , we &apos;ll check into the mail order thing .
in the meantime ,
i need a specific list of
exactly who you sold them to .
well , i &apos;d love to help you out ,
but we don &apos;t keep records of
things like rifle casings .
it &apos;s too small a purchase to track ,
and with all the federal monitoring of gun sales ,
we don &apos;t look to add more paperwork to the pile .
right . why would you do that ?
why would you go out of your way to track something
that does 600 miles an hour ,
comes out of a gun and kills people ?
guns don &apos;t kill people !
shut up , norm ! stop , okay ,
with that stupid sentence , okay ?
the fact is idiots with guns kill people .
no guns . no killing . it &apos;s that simple .
thank you , norm . we appreciate your help .
okay . whoa . you don &apos;t want to get
a grenade or a rocket launcher ?
something nice like that ?
hey , i keep that stuff in the back if you &apos;re interested .
i &apos;m sure you do . i have no reason to doubt you .
get him out of my shop . he &apos;s bad for business .
thanks .
pleasure .
and thanks again for the call .
you hear anything else , you let us know .
call ? what call ?
what do you mean &quot; what call ? &quot;
wait a minute . i thought you said
he responded to the hpd canvass ?
you didn &apos;t call hpd about that casing ?
no , i didn &apos;t call hpd .
get down !
cover left , danny !
got ya .
you guys need backup ?
no !
no !
hey , i got movement coming out of the garage .
got your belt on ?
of course i got my belt on . you &apos;re driving .
okay , do me a favor . don &apos;t pass on the right !
what ?
people are not paying attention .
they &apos;re listening to their radios .
they hear sirens , they look up ,
they see lights . what do you think they do ?
they should get out of my way or pull over .
okay , exactly . that &apos;s why you do not
pass on the right alright ?
people naturally , they pull to the right
when they hearen sirens .
what do you want me to do ? !
let this guy get away ?
no , no , no .
the better plan would maybe be to let me ,
a trained police pursuit driver ,
operate his own vehicle . that &apos;s what i think .
oh , you &apos;re the better driver ? is that what you &apos;re saying ?
on a janky dirt road peppered with land mines
in the middle of a third world country , yes ,
maybe you may have me beat .
but here on the well @-@ paved bustling streets of honolulu ,
i am 1,000 % the better driver !
chin .
coast guard have any luck finding our shooter ?
nah , they &apos;re still looking . what do you got ?
steve , the sniper was in a third @-@ floor vacant office
across from the gun store . we also found another victim .
what ? !
a painter . must &apos;ve surprised our guy .
snapped his neck like a twig .
not just snapped .
it looks like someone put his neck in a vise .
it &apos;s crushed .
all right , get the i.d. techs over there
and process the scene .
our boy left in a hurry .
he forgot to take the gun case with him .
we &apos;ll make sure it &apos;s held for prints .
roger that .
that &apos;s a hand .
it &apos;s a prosthetic .
okay , now it makes sense why we haven &apos;t been able
to pull any prints from the crime scenes .
well , the good news is it narrows our suspect pool down .
couldn &apos;t be too many one @-@ armed snipers running around , right ?
yeah .
so what &apos;s with the face ? what &apos;s the matter ?
i think i just figured out who our sniper is .
happened about 20 years ago when i was a kid .
ookala , ben keoki , my dad , they all received
the department medal of valor
for stopping this bank heist that was going on downtown .
these guys had already wounded a bunch of the employees .
once my dad and the boys get there ,
they have to make a forced entry .
go ! go , go , go !
all right , there &apos;s a brutal shoot @-@ out .
my dad puts a couple rounds into this guy .
curt stoner .
during the shoot @-@ out ,
stoner has his hands on the blasting caps .
one of my dad &apos;s rounds hits the blasting cap ,
blows stoner &apos;s hands off .
well , i can see why he &apos;d be upset about that .
now it &apos;s payback time .
according to this , stoner did his bid ,
and he was released three months ago .
model prisoner . he had a personal recommendation from the warden .
they must &apos;ve thought he was rehabilitat
there &apos;s a letter from his p.o.
only took him two weeks to violate ,
and now he has been off the map ever since .
whoa , wait a minute , danny .
military record .
before prison , stoner was a scout sniper in vietnam .
yeah , kono , go .
steve , duke lukela
was just found shot in an alley .
what happened ? he responded to a suspicious person call .
when he arrived , it looks like our sniper
drilled him between the shoulders .
he &apos;s lost a lot of blood and tissue , steve .
well , where is he , kono ? is he alive ?
tripler .
steve , look at this .
duke was part of the team that took down stoner .
kono ...
stay with lukela , okay ?
those army docs are the best in the business .
you make sure they do everything humanly possible , okay ?
lukela is not gonna die .
right .
steve , there &apos;s two other cops in this photo .
danny , we need to call hpd
and get these guys protection
before this bastard strikes again .
max ...
please tell me you got something .
well , i &apos;ve been working posthaste
to deliver you some workable results .
the good news is ,
i processed the painter &apos;s body
and was able to determine
that the cod was a result of this .
right . the hand .
that &apos;s fantastic work , max .
but now we do have to find the rest of the tin man .
that &apos;s exactly the reason why i called you here ,
detective williams .
when i examined your evidence ,
i discovered that these particular prosthetics
have a hidden registration number engraved on the servo .
when i ran it ,
it came back to our assumed suspect ,
curt stoner , who received two prosthetics
courtesy of the hawaii state corrections department .
this particular prosthetic has a warranty
filled out by stoner three days after he was released from halawa prison .
all right . please tell me he put an address down .
he did .
unfortunately , it &apos;s just a private mailbox in chinatown .
that &apos;s a start .
all right , thanks , max .
what &apos;s the word on lukela ?
he made it through surgery .
they &apos;re optimistic .
all right , good .
let &apos;s go .
mahalo .
how you doing , sir ?
okay .
we &apos;re looking for this man . have you seen him ?
nope .
you sure about that ?
our records show that he rents a mailbox here .
you only got about a hundred of them .
mister , i don &apos;t keep track of &apos; em .
why don &apos;t you take another look , okay ?
he &apos;s got a pair of prosthetic hands .
i &apos;m sorry , mister , i just don &apos;t know .
okay . let me see your box rental list .
i can &apos;t give out information like that .
the people in this neighborhood rely on me to keep their privacy .
so ... unless you have a warrant ...
okay , fine .
forget this guy . we can have a warrant drawn up in an hour .
or you can draw your knife and petrify everybody .
hey , wait a minute . h @-@ hold on .
hey ! you just committed a federal offense .
actually , that &apos;s not true . technically , uh ,
that &apos;s a filing cabinet , not a mailbox . so ...
most of these are registered to the apartment complex upstairs .
there must be a hundred units in this building .
what are we gonna do , knock on each door ?
you recognize that &quot; o &quot; ?
yeah . it &apos;s written from bottom to top .
our suspect &apos;s handwriting .
apartment 324 .
clear left .
clear here .
coffee &apos;s still warm .
he must &apos;ve just left .
where the hell is this guy ?
hello , commander mcgarrett .
kono ...
i &apos;m sorry i missed you today . that won &apos;t happen again .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re curious about who is next on my list .
if you want an answer to that question ,
look in the drawer by the phone .
i think you &apos;ll find it very interesting .
what is it ?
get away from the windows !
rooftop across the street .
hpd , be advised .
suspect is on the roof adjacent to our position .
what are you doing ?
just cover me .
kono .
take the shot .
you &apos;re gonna get one chance , all right ?
take the shot !
what are we doing ?
we &apos;re not doing anything .
i &apos;m gonna take the car , draw his fire .
when kono gets the shot ,
she &apos;s gonna take it , okay ?
steve , he &apos;s a sniper , okay ?
you &apos;re not gonna make it to the end of the block .
oh , yeah , don &apos;t listen to me !
don &apos;t listen to reason ! be you !
it &apos;s very you of you !
nice shot , kono .
what was that ?
what are you , scarface ? what were you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know , i guess i misinterpreted your game plan ,
which for the record was seriously flawed .
you were worried about me .
worried ? no , no , i was worried about my car .
i &apos;m touched .
yeah , you &apos;re touched .
you &apos;re touched in the head .
you are touched by something that i cannot explain .
and so you know , there are
a lot of things on this planet that i am worried about .
losing you in a combat situation is not one of them .
okay ?
rough day .
let &apos;s get out of here .
we just wanted to thank you , steve .
you &apos;re all i could &apos;ve hoped for in a son , steven .
i &apos;m proud of you .
steve , come on !
