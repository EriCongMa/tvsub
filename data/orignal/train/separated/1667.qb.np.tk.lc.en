whatcha doing ?
i &apos;m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image
so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain .
interesting .
i usually just have coffee .
you &apos;ve been up all night ?
is it morning ?
yes .
then i &apos;ve been up all night .
and you &apos;re stuck ?
why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus ?
oh , sorry , sweetie , i can &apos;t help you till i &apos;ve had my coffee .
penny , i told you if you don &apos;t put him in his crate at night
he just runs around the apartment .
what is he doing now ?
hmm , he &apos;s either isolating the terms
of his formula and examining them individually ,
or ...
looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand
after peter pan cut it off .
captain hook &apos;s hand was eaten by a crocodile ,
not an alligator .
if you &apos;re going to mock me , at least get your facts straight .
aye , aye , captain .
i can &apos;t see it !
it just won &apos;t coalesce .
maybe you need a fresh start .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s a great idea , leonard . thank you .
electrons move through graphene ...
act as if they have no mass ...
how long has he been stuck ?
intellectually about 30 hours .
emotionally about 29 years .
unit cell contains two carbon atoms ...
interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees .
have you tried rebooting him ?
no , i think it &apos;s a firmware problem .
hey , it &apos;s disco night at the moonlight roller rink
in glendale tonight .
who &apos;s up for getting down ?
that &apos;s perfect .
bernadette &apos;s been hocking me to take her roller skating .
i think penny likes to skate .
the four of us could double .
what could be better ? we &apos;re in .
great . it &apos;s not like i brought it up because i wanted to go .
you can come with us .
no , it &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t have to go .
i &apos;m happy just to guide you and your ladies
to suitable entertainment choices .
i &apos;m a walking brown yelp.com.
structure , constant structure . one atom ...
boy , he &apos;s really gone , isn &apos;t he ?
yeah , this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant .
i thought i smelled popcorn .
pattern is the same as fermions travels on the pathways ...
hexagonal ... it &apos;s always hexagonal ...
i haven &apos;t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out
the third matrix movie .
hey , those are my lima beans !
not lima beans , carbon atoms .
but if i don &apos;t eat my lima beans ,
i can &apos;t have my cookie .
here , you want my peas ?
the peas-- perfect .
they can be electrons .
want my corn ?
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
what would i do with corn ?
so roller skating-- should we all grab a bite to eat first ?
good . p.f. chang &apos;s ?
my mom has coupons .
great .
your mom &apos;s not coming , right ?
not this time , i promise .
okay , just to be clear , roller skating was my idea ,
and i &apos;m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date ,
and i hope you both fall on your asses
and break your coccyxes .
the plural of coccyx is coccyges .
screw you . give me back my lima beans .
oh , my god . have you ever been so embarrassed ?
not recently .
i don &apos;t know which was lamer :
their roller @-@ skating or their disco dancing .
for me , the worst part
was when people saw us leave with them .
you had some nice moves out there , howard .
thanks . you , too .
did you notice all the people looking at us ?
not really . i was in my boogie zone .
when howard tried to do the splits ...
shh .
sorry . i &apos;m moving a little slow .
i think i bruised my coccyx .
oh , poor baby .
don &apos;t tell koothrappali .
after you .
oh , what a gentleman .
hey , sheldon .
oh , my god !
are you ...
good lord !
you &apos;re ruining everything !
oh , damn .
are you okay ?
do i look okay ?
don &apos;t bark at me . i fell , too .
oh , you &apos;ve been falling all night . you &apos;re used to it .
sheldon , what the hell are you doing ?
the same thing i &apos;ve been doing for three days .
trying to figure out why electrons
behave as if they have no mass
when traveling through a graphene sheet .
with marbles ?
well , i needed something bigger
than peas , now , didn &apos;t i ?
sheldon , when was the last time you got any sleep ?
i don &apos;t know-- two , three days .
not important .
i don &apos;t need sleep . i need answers .
i need to determine where
in this swamp of unbalanced formulas
squatteth the toad of truth .
toad of truth ?
is that a physics thing ?
no , that &apos;s a crazy thing .
okay , sheldon .
what happens to our neuroreceptors
when we don &apos;t get enough rem sleep ?
they lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine .
which leads to ... ?
impaired cognitive function .
right , so march in there , brush your teeth and go to bed .
but i don &apos;t want to go to bed .
i &apos;m going to count to three . one ...
oh , all right .
that was amazing how you handled him .
i know how to deal with stubborn children .
my mother used to run an illegal day care center in our basement .
leonard , you &apos;re ... you &apos;re giggling in your sleep .
it &apos;s not me .
it &apos;s my new ringtone .
the joker from batman .
well , it creeps me out .
me , too , but i paid three bucks for it .
just answer the phone .
hello .
yeah , i &apos;m leonard hofstadter .
yeah , yeah , he &apos;s my roommate .
oh , god , is he okay ?
yeah , all @-@ all right . i &apos;ll be right there .
what happened ?
sheldon &apos;s escaped and is terrorizing the village .
okay . have fun .
hi . i &apos;m dr. hofstadter .
where is he ?
ball pit .
thanks for not calling the cops .
oh , hey , it &apos;s no big deal .
my sister &apos;s got a kid who &apos;s special .
ah , well , he &apos;s extra special .
hey , shelly .
what you doing ?
size ratio was all wrong .
couldn &apos;t visualize it .
needed bigger carbon atoms .
sure , sure .
how did you get into this place ?
back door has a five @-@ pin tumbler system ,
single @-@ circuit alarm . child &apos;s play .
you can start sorting protons and neutrons
while i build carbon atoms .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
we need to go home now .
but i &apos;m still working .
if you don &apos;t come out of there ,
i &apos;m going to have to drag you out .
you can try , but you &apos;ll never catch me .
for god &apos;s sakes .
sheldon , come here !
bazinga .
bazinga .
bazinga .
bazinga .
bazinga .
leonard and penny .
leonard and penny .
what ? what , what , what ?
leonard and penny .
what ?
i have good news .
and you had to barge in here and wake us up
in the middle of the night ?
your cell phone was off .
because we didn &apos;t want to be disturbed .
well , that didn &apos;t work out , did it ?
sheldon , what do you want ?
i came to tell you i &apos;ve got the answer .
really ?
you figured out the graphene problem ?
no , no , i &apos;m still hopelessly stuck on that ,
but i figured out how to figure it out .
okay , you know what , leonard , i know i said
i could handle your roommate , but i was wrong .
we &apos;re going to have to break up .
what are you talking about ?
einstein .
yeah , i &apos;m going to need a little more .
albert einstein .
keep going .
when albert einstein came up with special relativity ,
he was working at the patent office .
so , you &apos;re going to go work at the patent office ?
don &apos;t be absurd .
that &apos;s in washington .
you know i could never live in a city whose streets
are laid out in a wheel @-@ and @-@ spoke pattern .
no . i &apos;m going to find
a similarly menial job
where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task ,
freeing my prefrontal cortex
to work quietly in the background on my problem .
sounds like a great plan .
of course it is .
even talking to you is
sufficiently menial that i can feel
the proverbial juices starting to flow .
okay , well , thanks for sharing with us .
good night .
you &apos;re welcome .
and good night to you , too .
oh , by the way , i was watching you sleep for a moment ,
and i noticed that your snoring
seems to be worse when you &apos;re on your back .
leonard doesn &apos;t snore .
no , i wasn &apos;t talking to leonard .
told you .
so , mr. cooper , you &apos;re looking for a job .
a menial job .
like yours .
well , thank you for noticing .
i &apos;m &quot; menial employee of the month . &quot;
do you have a particular field in mind ?
i do .
for thousands of years ,
the lowest classes of the human race
have spent their lives laboring to erect monuments
under the lash of their betters ,
until finally , they dropped down
and became one with the dust through which they trudged .
do you have anything like that ?
no .
shouldn &apos;t you check your database ?
no .
you didn &apos;t really type ?
i didn &apos;t really have to .
so , how about construction ?
oh , that would be good !
sawing , hammering , eating out of a lunch pail
as my working @-@ class fellows and i
sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis .
no , no . this is putting up sheetrock
at a housing project in rosemead .
i could do that .
good .
one question .
yes ?
what &apos;s sheetrock ?
moving on .
how about doing deliveries for a florist ?
that seems acceptable .
do you have your own car ?
i don &apos;t drive .
of course you don &apos;t .
mr. cooper , let me just ask you a question .
what was your last job ?
senior theoretical particle physicist at caltech ,
focusing on m theory , or , in layman &apos;s terms , string theory .
i see .
just give me a second .
security !
okay , i &apos;ll get those drinks started for you .
behind you .
sheldon , what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to get these tables cleared . we &apos;re slammed .
no , wait , wait , no , wait .
wh @-@ what are you doing here ?
a reasonable question .
i asked myself ,
what is the most mind @-@ numbing , pedeststrian job conceivable ,
and three answers came to mind :
uh , toll booth attendant , apple store genius ...
... and what penny does .
now ...
since i don &apos;t like touching other people &apos;s coins ,
and i refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word &quot; genius , &quot;
here i am .
you just , you just walked in and they hired you , just like that ?
oh , heavens , no .
since i don &apos;t need to be paid , i didn &apos;t need to be hired .
i simply came in , picked up a tray , and started &quot; working for the man . &quot;
let me get that plate out of your way .
sheldon , this is ridiculous .
is it ?
just a moment ago , i had a minor epiphany
regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon
while scraping congealed nachos off a plate .
bernadette , table 10 wants their check .
thanks , sheldon .
sheldon , wait , this isn &apos;t even what i do .
i &apos;m a waitress , not a busboy .
you &apos;re right . that is more menial .
hello , i &apos;m sheldon . i &apos;ll be your server today .
i don &apos;t recommend the salmon .
i saw it in the kitchen .
all right , one bacon cheeseburger ,
breaking two jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously--
kudos .
beer @-@ battered fish and chips .
now , here &apos;s your tartar sauce .
i also brought you salsa .
it &apos;s a little unconventional , but i think you &apos;ll like it .
it &apos;s zingy .
and for you , factory burrito grande--
no cheese , no sour cream ,
no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance .
bon appetit .
hang on .
black beans , not pinto beans ?
yes .
double guacamole ?
of course .
no cilantro ?
nope .
lettuce shredded , not chopped ?
yep .
you understand why i &apos;m doing this to you ?
i do .
that &apos;ll be all .
that was fun .
how long can he keep this up ?
i heard about this professor at mit
who melted down , bought a van ,
and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer .
he never went back to the university ?
only to shampoo professor shamburg &apos;s shitzu
sheesh .
i bet if we all chipped in , we could buy sheldon a van .
but he &apos;s afraid of dogs .
yeah , that &apos;s the only thing wrong with that plan .
hey , guys , sorry you had to wait , but we are swamped .
what &apos;s this ?
sheldon took our order .
sheldon doesn &apos;t work here .
well , honey , not to complain ,
but we were starting to think you didn &apos;t either .
is that really necessary ?
good lord .
the interference pattern in the fracture .
the motion of the wave through the molecular structure .
i &apos;ve been looking at it all wrong .
i can &apos;t consider the electrons as particles .
they move through the graphene as a wave .
it &apos;s a wave !
the moment to applaud would be now .
troglodytes .
sheldon ... where are you going ?
aren &apos;t you going to clean this up ?
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t work here .
happy now ?
i &apos;m on a cloud .
swing me .
sheldon , come here .
bazinga .
bazinga .
bazinga .
bazinga .
