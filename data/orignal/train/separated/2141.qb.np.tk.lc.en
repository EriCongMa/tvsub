i &apos;m ailana read , child services .
yesterday morning we finally managed
to locate your niece &apos;s aunt and uncle in mexico .
okay . and ?
they have retained a lawyer , and are taking steps to adopt sara .
how long before it &apos;s finalized ?
no more than a month .
are we sure these murders are connected ?
everything &apos;s pointing towards this being serial .
so this guy murders four people
within days of each other at the same hotel ,
then turns up dead ?
what is that ?
i have no idea .
hey , show me your hands ! get out !
we got another one .
those carvings are modeled after 11th century chess pieces .
pawns , to be exact .
maybe whoever knocked off hein and larsen
thinks this thing is a game .
it &apos;s from the same chess set as all the other pieces .
which tells me that whoever compelled
anthony lee hein , david larsen ,
and , more than likely , pierre shaw
to kill on their behalf ,
that they &apos;re still out there .
and i take it you &apos;re here because
you want my help ?
yeah , i mean , you were a behavioral analyst
马诺阿
for the fbi for 15 years .
you &apos;ve profiled a lot of serial killers .
i &apos;m also retired .
that chess piece you &apos;re holding is our only solid lead .
we have allocated
absolutely every available resource to this case .
it &apos;s been a week , and , well ,
we , uh ... we have nothing .
well , that &apos;s not unusual in cases like this ,
where the killer suddenly goes to ground .
that &apos;s when it becomes a waiting game .
patience , that &apos;ll be the key .
patience is definitely not his strong suit .
he left that in my house .
in my house .
what , is he taunting me ?
help me understand , please .
on the contrary .
commander , i , uh ...
i think that the killer admires you .
the knight is the protector of the realm .
in chess , that is a very powerful weapon in close positions .
i think he sees you as a potentially
dangerous adversary , unlike the victims ,
who were mere pawns , expendable foot soldiers .
this is just my opinion ,
but i think that the chess metaphor ,
with the people moving around
and the thing with ... i don &apos;t , uh ...
i don &apos;t buy it , personally . no disrespect , miss brown .
maybe this guy is not as smart as you think he is .
and yet , here you are in my home asking for help .
don &apos;t make the mistake of underestimating this person , detective .
he doesn &apos;t just have people killing for him ,
he has them sending him pictures , evidence of his work .
that is a highly sophisticated form of manipulation .
the government of hawaii has empowered us
to do whatever is necessary to , uh ,
to catch whoever &apos;s responsible .
so i need you to tell me what it &apos;s gonna take
for you to come and work for us ,
temporarily , of course .
i &apos;m sorry , commander , but i &apos;m ... i &apos;m retired .
do you understand that innocent people are dead ?
innocent people with families .
that &apos;s got to mean something to you .
it does .
my answer &apos;s still no .
good luck .
we &apos;ll let ourselves out . thank you .
that was a waste of time , huh ?
enjoy your evening , sir .
威基基
we have a situation .
leaving so soon ?
well , i have an appointment in the morning ,
so i have to be up early .
well , just let me know what time .
i &apos;ll make sure to nudge you .
you &apos;re rather forward , aren &apos;t you , mister ...
call me harry . and you are ?
search him .
what , no foreplay ?
easy on the goods there , old boy .
nothing .
tear the place apart .
i want it found .
then get rid of him .
what did you do with it ?
马诺阿
i &apos;ve got to be honest ,
i don &apos;t really know what i &apos;m doing .
but i don &apos;t think this is a french braid .
it &apos;s a hawaiian braid .
yes , it is . i guess it is .
hold on .
what do you think ?
all right .
i hope i can remember how to do this tomorrow .
hey , you okay ?
why do i have to go live with someone else ?
oh , sweetie , they &apos;re not just someone else , they &apos;re family .
you belong with them .
so are you , right ?
you &apos;re family .
i want to live with you , uncle chin .
listen , listen ...
come here , you .
i &apos;m gonna visit you as soon as i can , okay ?
that &apos;s a promise .
火奴鲁鲁
vic &apos;s name is casta mitchell .
she &apos;s a 22 @-@ year @-@ old student .
she &apos;s on the books of a local modeling agency .
excuse me .
forced entry .
apartment was tossed .
vic had cash and jewelry that was left behind .
still , obviously , perp was looking for something .
body &apos;s in here .
cod was strangulation .
well , i assume there &apos;s no chess pieces ,
so that &apos;s something , right ?
looks like she was dressed for an evening out .
kono , see if you can find out where she went .
yeah , well , this might help .
this was found in her purse .
the symbol on it &apos;s called the eye of horus .
it &apos;s an egyptian charm .
it &apos;s supposed to bring good luck .
yeah , only not for her .
your girl fought back .
she did this to herself trying to remove her attacker &apos;s hands ,
but in addition to her own skin tissue ,
i also found foreign dna under her fingernails .
we get an i.d. ?
not initially .
but after broadening my search ,
i got a hit in an unlikely place ...
哈利 · 兰福德
interpol .
interpol ?
his name is harry langford .
and from what i gather , he &apos;s an mi6 agent
with a &quot; kill or capture &quot; notice on him .
okay , so he &apos;s a british spy running rogue .
he took a huge risk stepping out of the shadows
with that kind of heat on him .
seems like whatever he was looking for
in casta &apos;s apartment was pretty important .
all right , reached out to mi6 .
here &apos;s what we know on langford .
guy was former british sas .
he joined the agency in 2006,
served with distinction until a few years ago
when he was caught selling state secrets .
see that ? train a guy to be all underhanded and sneaky ,
and what does he do ?
he ends up being all underhanded and sneaky .
well , langford was disavowed .
he &apos;s been on the run ever since .
i ran facial rec against the tsa database .
he came into hawaii two days ago under an alias .
there &apos;s now a statewide apb on him .
let &apos;s hope we have better luck than british intel .
every time they get a bead on this guy , he vanishes .
hey , i ran casta mitchell &apos;s cell phone .
check out this text she got yesterday .
&quot; the eye will get you in .
dress appropriately . as always , discretion is key . &quot;
text traced back to a woman named lucy mitsu .
she runs a local agency that books girls
for high @-@ end parties and local events .
oh , that don &apos;t sound shady at all .
i &apos;m guessing , uh , casta is one of her models .
okay , so where was this party ?
it was at the private residence of this guy .
lucky morad .
oh , he seems fun .
egyptian @-@ born businessman with a net worth
in the nine figures .
and by all accounts , he spends much of that money
living the hard @-@ partying life of an international playboy .
i got to get some new friends .
anyway , i ran langford &apos;s picture by miss mitsu ,
and she confirmed he was at the party .
she said that our guy was involved in some dustup
with morad &apos;s security .
she heard there was a robbery ,
but when they searched langford ,
they came up empty .
okay , what happened to langford after that ?
well , security took him away , and no one saw him again .
but this is where it gets interesting .
right before they caught up to langford ,
he was talking to casta ,
and the vibe was very flirtatious .
picked a hell of a time to push up on this girl .
well , maybe he did steal something ,
and he was using her
to get whatever he stole out of the party .
and then langford tracks her down later ,
kills her , and takes back whatever he stole from morad .
well , morad seemed to want to keep this robbery a secret ,
because according to hpd , he never filed a police report .
well , i think that means that
whatever was stolen from morad
was either embarrassing as hell or was illegal .
probably rule out a sex tape .
unless , of course ,
this guy wanted a reality show for himself .
think about it , a guy like this .
but then , of course , he would have put it out himself .
just some thoughts .
no , no , no , let her up . let her up , i know her .
miss brown , what a nice surprise .
is it , commander ?
you left this on my coffee table .
really ?
yeah .
or , of course , it could have been a mistake
or a not @-@ so @-@ subtle ploy to keep me thinking about your case .
that &apos;s definitely the sort of underhanded thing that he would do .
no , i ...
yeah . well , it worked .
so just to be clear ,
my position hasn &apos;t changed .
i &apos;m retired .
absolutely . yes , ma &apos;am .
absolutely .
i did some digging .
as it turns out , hein , larsen and shaw
all had something in common .
each one of them was being investigated
by an hpd homicide detective named philip lau .
wait a minute , this is ... this is brand @-@ new information .
i don &apos;t see how that didn &apos;t come up .
easy . it wasn &apos;t an official investigation .
as far as i can tell , no reports were filed .
he was looking into them on his own .
i &apos;ll get in touch with duke ,
and i &apos;ll tell him we need to have a sit @-@ down with this guy .
yeah , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
lau shot and killed himself six months ago .
we need to go through his files , pull his notes .
yeah , i already have .
there &apos;s not much there .
lau was looking at each of the men
for various open homicides , cold cases .
there was just never enough evidence to arrest .
sorry to interrupt , but hpd &apos;s got eyes on langford .
good luck , commander .
detective .
yes . thanks .
hey , you want to see what i had for breakfast ?
keep driving like a jerk .
would you man up once in your life ?
man up ?
man up .
man up ! you talking to me to man up ?
the guy who saved your life
going through life @-@ threatening surgery ?
you gonna talk to me like that ?
god , with the liver again ?
how long you gonna hold that over me ?
forever . or until we die
in a spectacular car crash three minutes from now .
everybody down ! five @-@ 0 ! clear .
hands in the air .
hands in the air ! yes , you .
now . now . yes .
back away .
well ... i guess we can call that a draw .
cufflinks with gps transponders .
the sunglasses are tricked out with infrared night vision ,
and the watch has a built @-@ in cellular jammer .
pretty sweet .
what about this ?
that &apos;s for holding money and credit cards .
i &apos;ve got to talk to mcgarrett about
upgrading five @-@ 0 &apos;s equipment .
i haven &apos;t worked out the hidden feature in that yet .
you &apos;re welcome .
i know i &apos;m in the minority ,
but roger moore was my favorite bond .
i mean , i grew up watching him ,
so that &apos;s probably why , but you ...
you seem like the , um ... the daniel craig type , right ?
i suppose we can &apos;t all be sean connery .
well , how about this ?
that &apos;s $ 20 million worth of diamonds right there .
i bet that &apos;s more than an mi6 pension .
commander , we both know i &apos;m not going to be here for long .
my government will insist that i be extradited .
in the meantime how about a cup of tea ?
milk and sugar .
that &apos;s pretty funny .
um , do you recognize this girl ?
you should because
your dna was found under her fingernails .
there &apos;s a simple explanation for that .
you had sex with her .
doesn &apos;t mean you ... you didn &apos;t kill her .
look , i &apos;m telling you this
because time is of the essence
and i need to get out of here as soon as possible .
that file your partner &apos;s holding
is entirely fabricated .
for the past three years i &apos;ve been infiltrating
the illegal arms market
in order to track down a high @-@ value target .
so what you &apos;re saying is mi6 disavowed you
just to legitimize your cover .
is that right ?
obviously , i regret ever involving casta .
she never knew she had the diamonds on her ,
but she was alive when i left her apartment .
if you &apos;re looking to make an arrest ,
i suggest you focus your attention on lucky morad .
if you want further verification that what i &apos;m saying is true ,
call the director of the cia .
he &apos;s fully briefed on this operation ,
which is a matter of international security .
and extremely time @-@ sensitive .
i &apos;ll make the call .
if your story checks out , we &apos;ll release you .
but there &apos;s a caveat .
go on .
if you &apos;re gonna be operating on this island ,
you do it under our supervision .
what , exactly , does that mean ?
it means that whatever you &apos;re doing ,
we are now involved .
uh , so why don &apos;t you let us know
what we &apos;re dealing with here .
this is nashid el hamadi ,
mastermind behind the bombing
of the uk embassy in madrid in 2012 .
you &apos;ve used one of these before .
actually , it &apos;s my first time ,
but it seems pretty straightforward .
the attack left six dead , dozens injured ,
and propelled el hamadi
to the top of my government &apos;s most @-@ wanted list .
we &apos;ve known for some time he &apos;s been planning
a large @-@ scale attack somewhere in europe .
then two weeks ago we intercepted comms
between him and morad discussing a deal for the greystone .
okay , what exactly is the greystone ?
it &apos;s a next @-@ gen decryption tool
capable of cracking any computer network .
so you &apos;re saying there &apos;s gonna be a potential cyber attack ?
we don &apos;t know the specifics .
my plan was to intercept the greystone
before el hamadi &apos;s courier took possession .
but when i got to morad &apos;s penthouse to cracked the safe ,
the device was gone , and in its place were the diamonds .
payment for the device .
the trade had already been made .
exactly . i was too late .
now el hamadi &apos;s man is in the wind .
hey , there . jerry ortega .
i &apos;m special consultant for five @-@ 0 .
but of course you are .
so is it &quot; mr. langford , &quot;
or is there a &quot; double @-@ o &quot; number i should be using ?
harry is fine , thank you .
okay . harry .
well , here &apos;s your stuff .
thank you .
did you fiddle with this ?
maybe .
well , it &apos;s a good thing you brought it
back to me when you did .
another three minutes and this building
would have been reduced to rubble .
i &apos;m kidding , old chap . you &apos;re good .
can we get back to the greystone , please ?
right , as i was saying , el hamadi &apos;s courier has it .
i imagine he &apos;s on his way to him as we speak . right .
do you know who the courier is ?
unfortunately , no .
my next play was to approach morad ,
offer him his diamonds back in return for the courier &apos;s name ,
then grab him before he could make delivery .
i like it . where &apos;s morad now ?
actually , he &apos;s due to attend a black tie event downtown
in less than two hours .
all right , a big party like that ,
morad &apos;s bound to have heavy security .
if he doesn &apos;t want to go quietly ,
there &apos;s gonna be a lot of collateral .
chin &apos;s right , this needs to be a surgical op .
hope you got your tux pressed .
is everybody enjoying themselves this evening ?
i don &apos;t know , man , i think the dry @-@ cleaner
shrunk my damn tux .
i hear that happens a lot .
we got eyes on morad .
we &apos;re in position .
good .
hpd &apos;s got all points of egress covered .
we are good to go .
okay , you &apos;re on .
wish me luck .
oh , you don &apos;t need any luck ,
not looking like that .
thank you .
can &apos;t a girl buy a man a drink ?
and who might you be ?
melissa .
i &apos;m lucky .
yes , you are .
tell me , melissa , do you like to dance ?
only with men who know what they &apos;re doing .
that &apos;s what i like about american women .
you &apos;re not afraid to make the first move .
you like your women to be forward ?
if they look like you ...
sure .
well , let me cut to the chase .
i have your diamonds .
if you want them back ...
... then meet me on the patio in two minutes .
i misjudged you .
you &apos;re not confident , you &apos;re stupid .
you think you can come down here and shake me down ?
and here i was thinking that
we &apos;d have some time to ourselves .
you never said to come alone .
no , i didn &apos;t .
you really have to stop crashing my parties .
lucky morad , you &apos;re under arrest .
for the murder of casta mitchell .
but before we put you away ,
you &apos;re gonna tell us who you gave the greystone to .
i sense there &apos;s an &quot; or &quot; coming .
no !
what do you got there ?
lobster .
lobster ?
where &apos;d you get that ? is it any good ?
yeah , it &apos;s pretty good .
can i try one ?
okay , okay , i &apos;ll tell you what you want to know !
hold on .
hold on .
okay . that &apos;s incredible .
yeah , right ?
i enjoy good shellfish as much as the next bloke ,
but i &apos;m losing my grip here .
all right , get him up . come here .
i &apos;ll tell you what you want to know !
come here ! stop crying !
he &apos;s moroccan .
amir rabbab . he has the greystone .
okay , what &apos;s he plan on doing with it ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re lying .
i swear !
the man that he works for , el hamadi .
he &apos;s committed to making his next move
bigger than the madrid bombing .
where do we find rabbab ?
it &apos;s too late .
he just took a plane to europe this morning .
you all right ?
ah , i see , he &apos;s very upset
that you have your own jet
and he doesn &apos;t get to fly it .
do me a favor , shut up for a minute , would you ?
listen , you realize you drop 5,000 feet
we &apos;re probably gonna knock off 15 minutes of the flight time .
we could do the same by lightening the load .
you look to be around 14 stone .
care to volunteer ?
you &apos;ve got to , well , excuse him , see ,
he &apos;s got , um , control issues .
i don &apos;t have control issues .
okay , i like to drive ,
unlike you , who likes to be chauffeured everywhere .
no , i don &apos;t ... no , i don &apos;t like to be chauffeured .
i kind of don &apos;t have a choice .
and besides , why would you ever want to fly an airplane again
after what happened last time ?
not my fault .
what happened ?
what hap ... well , let &apos;s just say
that i am half the man that i used to be
in the liver department because of him .
again , it &apos;s not my fault . it wasn &apos;t my fault .
you know what else he is , besides a putz ?
he is a , um ... a bullet magnet .
oh . i wish you &apos;d have mentioned that
before i asked you two boys to come with .
you &apos;re getting a call from home .
langford here .
you &apos;re on with commander mcgarrett and detective williams .
guys , it &apos;s chin .
we just intercepted a call from rabbab ;
he &apos;s in prague .
he &apos;s got a meeting set in stare mesto .
it &apos;s the old city , one hour from now .
all right , how soon can we get there ?
maybe 90 minutes .
no , that &apos;s not good enough .
you might want to buckle up .
捷克共和国
amir rabbab , get on the ground right now .
show me your hands ! right now !
get down !
don &apos;t move , don &apos;t move , or i &apos;m not gonna kill you , all right ?
where is it ?
where &apos;s the greystone ?
he hasn &apos;t got it .
travel documents , fake passport .
looks like somebody was getting ready to skip town .
look at this guy .
he already unloaded the greystone .
is that right , amir ?
where &apos;s your boss now ? where &apos;s el hamadi ?
why did he arrange for the handoff to happen in prague ?
what does he have planned ?
commander ?
there &apos;s an urgent call for you .
okay , thank you .
steve , we just heard from interpol .
nuclear sites across europe are reporting
sudden loss of command and control functions over their reactors .
how many ?
at least a dozen so far .
it gets worse .
in the last ten minutes ,
each reactor &apos;s coolant systems have been compromised ,
and now core temperatures are spiraling out of control .
we made a model of the nuclear fallout ,
and given there &apos;s no time for evacuations ,
we &apos;re looking at immediate casualties in the thousands ,
with millions more affected .
paris , munich , london .
steve , this is gonna be chernobyl times a hundred .
okay , so this was el hamadi &apos;s plan all along .
he &apos;s weaponized europe &apos;s nuclear plants , turned them into bombs .
according to interpol , the hack is coming from the east side .
we &apos;ll have coordinates within the hour .
no , it &apos;s not good enough .
we don &apos;t have that kind of time .
we need to break rabbab . we &apos;re gonna do it right now .
what &apos;s this ?
what are you doing ?
mr. rabbab , we have , unfortunately , run out of time .
which means your opportunity to engage
in a civilized exchange is no longer on the table .
and because i am bound to specific rules of conduct ,
our parley has come to an end .
unfortunately , for you , those same rules
don &apos;t apply to my friend from the united states .
last chance , amir .
where &apos;s the hacker with the greystone ?
cheers , then .
wait . wait . wait .
i &apos;ll tell you where he is .
stay down !
he &apos;s dead .
the first reactor &apos;s gone critical .
we &apos;ve got less than three minutes .
well , that didn &apos;t work .
what are you doing ? stop . let somebody else do this .
like who ?
i don &apos;t know , like who .
some kind of person who is qualified
to do things with computers . okay ? anyone ...
i realize you americans
like to solve your problems with brute force ,
but there &apos;s an easier way .
see ? he obviously knows how to work a computer .
系统锁定
uh @-@ oh .
&quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; ? what is that ?
is that , uh , is that british for &quot; everything &apos;s okay &quot; or what ?
there &apos;s a bug implanted . it won &apos;t let me shut down .
ok . watch your eyes .
oh ! what the hell is the matter with you ? !
i fixed it .
you fixed it ? !
look at the computer .
why would you do something like that ?
i &apos;m standing right here .
i just fixed that . i just fixed that .
you &apos;re gonna shoot bullets at a computer ? !
what &apos;d i do ?
what are you , a mechanic ? !
you fixed ... - chaps .
what ?
reactor &apos;s stable .
he had n ... you had no idea that that was gonna work .
he said he needed to shut it down .
what did i do ? i shut it down .
just say it .
you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re a caveman and god bless you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i just spoke to chin .
told him we &apos;re on our way home . let &apos;s go . come on .
you know , i was thinking , maybe we , uh ...
stop over in london .
london ?
yeah , there &apos;s this , uh ...
this little pub rachel took me to on our first anniversary .
they got the best fish and chips you ever had in your life .
i really don &apos;t think i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s a good idea .
you want a victory lap of all the happy memories
of you and your ex @-@ wife .
it sounds disastrous .
what are you talking ... ? it &apos;s fish and chips .
yeah , and a whole bunch of memories
that are gonna make you sad .
i don &apos;t want that . i don &apos;t like you when you &apos;re sad .
well , that @-@ that @-@ that &apos;s why y @-@ y @-@ you &apos;re gonna make me happy .
just seeing you drive on the wrong side of the road
will bring a smile to my face . right ?
what &apos;s he doing ?
very strange .
hey , langford !
klara . klara .
where &apos;s the greystone ?
agent langford said you had it .
you don &apos;t have it ?
no .
son of a bitch . he played us .
i &apos;d offer you a drink
but i know it &apos;s against your beliefs ...
unlike killing thousands of innocent civilians .
do you have it ?
password .
i assume you will be wanting your compensation now , mr. langford .
keep the money .
i just want to have a chat with your boss .
no funny business , you understand ?
i suppose i should be surprised to see you , commander .
how &apos;d you do it ?
jerry ortega put a little something @-@ something in your watch .
it &apos;s a very small gps tracker .
you wouldn &apos;t even have noticed .
clever lad .
we know what you &apos;re doing and we know why you &apos;re doing it .
really ?
the madrid bombings , 2012,
you failed to mention an important detail .
one of the victims was your wife , wasn &apos;t it ?
joanna wallace .
revenge .
this thing is all about revenge ?
you &apos;re gonna , you &apos;re gonna walk in there where certain death
and potentially give up the greystone ,
just so you can settle the score with el hamadi ?
sorry , harry .
i can &apos;t let you do that .
we have a kill or capture order on el hamadi .
he &apos;s a high @-@ value target to our government , too .
which is why we &apos;re coming with you .
moving .
you should be the first one through this door .
you killed my wife .
langford .
langford .
langford .
langford .
langford .
langford .
no ! no !
英格兰 伦敦北部
she was the only one i ever really let in .
i got one of those .
where is she now ?
i don &apos;t know .
any chance of getting her back ?
no .
should , uh , probably get going .
yeah .
do you think , uh--
i don &apos;t want to be insensitive--
do you think she &apos;ll have , uh , fish and chips ?
sorry , mate , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s really her thing .
oh . all right . oh , well .
shoulders back , williams .
my shoulders are back .
how &apos;s my tie ?
fine . it looks just like it looked the last two times you asked me .
my suits all right ?
please don &apos;t ask me about your tie ...
the george cross .
commander steven mcgarrett .
detective daniel williams .
commander harry langford .
thank you , your majesty .
your majesty .
your majesty , thank you .
gentlemen , on behalf of a grateful nation ,
we thank you .
