and all these pins have people &apos;s names on them.rach , here you are .
why don &apos;t we just put me with a manattan in my hand ...
... talking to the cute bartender .
these pins aren &apos;t for playing , are they ?
the red are my guests , and the blue are yours .
this is so sad . i only have like 10 pins .
chandler , relax . it &apos;s not a contest .
certainly not a close one .
hey , rach .
stop picturing it !
i think that &apos;s it . the seating chart is done.this is our wedding .
they all look like they &apos;re having fun don &apos;t they ?
so where are my parents gonna be ?
well , if this is the wedding hall ...
... then your parents would be over here at home in queens .
they &apos;re not invited ? oh , no , they &apos;re gonna be crushed !
why would they think they &apos;re invited ?
you got me . i don &apos;t ...
joey !
look , i thought parents were coming .
your parents are coming . chandler &apos;s are coming .
ross &apos; parents are coming .
ross &apos; parents are my parents .
well , see , parents are coming .
we should invite them .
you just want more blue pins .
well , this is just sad .
all right.maybe i can fit them in if i just do some rearranging .
rachel may have to sit at the bar .
that is not a problem .
maybe you &apos;ll order a little sangria .
get out of here !
these are our tuxedos.if you like anything , we can make a deal .
anything at all.but these are the three that monica pre @-@ approved .
thanks a lot for hooking me up .
and i want you to know that i want you to attend our wedding as my guest .
i &apos;m monica &apos;s maid of honor .
okay , don &apos;t try to blue @-@ pin me .
well , these look nice .
they are nice .
when celebrities are done with them , they send them back .
you mean like for award shows ? - some of them .
they &apos;ve been down the red carpet with people yelling :
&quot; who are you wearing ? you look fabulous ! &quot;
might i suggest watching a little more espn ...
... and a little less e !
okay . who wore those ?
well , this one &apos;s tom brokaw .
not bad .
this one is paul o &apos;neill .
who &apos;s that ?
he plays for the yankees . seriously , espn .
just once in a while . have it on in the background .
this one was pierce brosnan.- pierce brosnan ?
are you serious ?
007 ?
this is james bond &apos;s tux ? i have to get married in james bond &apos;s tux .
it &apos;s a pretty cool tux .
it &apos;s not just that.i would be england &apos;s most powerful weapon .
a jet @-@ setting heartbreaker on her majesty &apos;s secret service .
a man who fears no one , with a license to kill .
would monica let me wear this ?
we should really learn how to play the real way .
i like our way .
chess !
nice move .
yeah .
i hooked ross and chandler up with tuxedos.do you need one ?
no , i &apos;m not wearing a tux .
what are you gonna wear ? - multi @-@ colored robes .
and maybe a hat .
does monica know about this ?
no .
can i please be there when you tell her ?
you want to go to a movie tonight ?
i &apos;m having dinner with melissa .
can i come ?
i won &apos;t talk . you &apos;ll just hear my video camera .
what ? what &apos;s going on ?
can i tell her ?
do you want what happened , or joey &apos;s lewd version ?
joey &apos;s .
okay .
i had this college friend ...
... and i made the mistake of telling joey that one time ...
... she and i , you know , kissed a little bit .
yeah , i &apos;m sure that happened .
it did .
sure .
hey . it happened .
it was senior year . it was after the sigma chi luau ...
... and melissa and i got very drunk .
and we ended up kissing .
for several minutes .
which means she had a couple spritzers and a peck on the cheek .
why are you taking this away from me ?
why is it so hard for you to believe ?
okay . i just didn &apos;t know that you were a lesbian .
i &apos;m not saying that i &apos;m a lesbian . i &apos;m just saying that this happened .
it just seems pretty wild . and you &apos;re so ...
... vanilla .
vanilla ? i &apos;m not vanilla . i do lots of crazy things .
i mean , i got drunk and married in vegas .
to ross .
if you don &apos;t believe me ...
... just come with me to dinner tonight and she &apos;ll tell you .
okay . because i can &apos;t picture it .
you should get inside my head .
guess what i got for your wedding ?
a freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head ?
rachel hooked me up with a tux . but not just any tux .
batmars tux !
what ?
that &apos;s right .
made expressly for val kilmer , and worn by him in the hit film ...
... that batman film he was in .
you can &apos;t wear that . i &apos;m wearing the famous tux .
james bond &apos;s tux !
so ?
so ? if you wear that , it &apos;ll make mine less special .
you need something to make this day special ?
hello ! you have the most special thing of all .
you are marrying the woman you love .
don &apos;t take away my cool thing . pretty please ?
&quot; pretty please ? &quot; not very 007 .
if you were getting married , i &apos;d never do anything to upset you .
you slept with my sister .
that was pretty 007 .
okay , good , you &apos;re here . all right , i figured it out .
i &apos;m gonna take 2 tables of 8 , add your parents ...
... and make them into 3 tables of 6 .
and i called the caterer . we are good to go !
yeah . they &apos;re not coming .
what ?
they think that you only invited them because of me .
they feel unwanted .
that &apos;s too bad . it &apos;s true . but too bad .
if you could just call my mom .
just let her know you want them there .
this is a woman who has sent you many lasagnas .
no , she hasn &apos;t .
is it her fault if some didn &apos;t make it to you ?
what am i gonna say ?
tell them you mixed up invitations.no , blame it on the post office .
they hate the post office . and the irish .
but i don &apos;t think you could blame it on them .
hello ? yeah , hi . mrs. tribbiani ? this is monica geller .
i &apos;m just calling to say that we really hope you can make it to the wedding .
apparently some of our invitations weren &apos;t delivered .
i guess there was some screw @-@ up at the damn post office .
tell me about it !
yeah , the u.s. post office ? no . more like u.s. lost office .
what are they , irish ?
anyway , his name &apos;s allen.and we &apos;ve been going out for three years .
he was my first client when i became a party planner .
he was actually planning a party for his girlfriend at the time .
oh , well .
he was theta beta pi at syracuse .
that &apos;s great .
were you ever in a sorority ?
of course .
yes . i was a thigh mega tampon .
what one ?
we were huge too . but they had to shut us down ...
... when regina phalangie died of alcohol poisoning .
isn &apos;t it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch ?
anyway ...
speaking of drinking too much , i told phoebe ...
... about that crazy night after the sigma chi luau where we made out .
what ?
remember we ... come on , we had sarongs on and the coconut bikini tops .
we went back to the house and got really silly ...
... and we made out .
wow , ray @-@ ray , i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
really ?
ross is batman .
well , he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time .
rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman .
batman is so much cooler than james bond .
what ? 007 has all those gadgets .
batman has a utility belt .
007 has a fancy car .
batman has the batmobile .
007 gets all the ladies .
batman has robin .
we get espn , right ?
how about you go put on your 007 tuxedo , and i &apos;ll make you a martini ?
i don &apos;t like martinis .
a yoo @-@ hoo with a funny straw ?
yum .
i know the invitation says 6 p . m.
but does that mean get there at 6 , or the show starts at 6 ?
&quot; the show &quot; ?
right , the wedding . gotcha .
but weddings start a little late , right ?
have you ever been to one of my weddings ?
well , it &apos;s the same day as my niece &apos;s christening ...
... and i want my parents to see me .
my part &apos;s in the beginning.i &apos;m not in the rest of the show ... wedding .
the wedding starts at 6 .
okay . i totally hear you .
how about this ? i vamp till they get there .
you &apos;ll &quot; vamp &quot; ?
like warm up the crowd . ask where they &apos;re from .
because in joey tribbiani , you get a minister and an entertainer .
i &apos;m a &quot; ministainer . &quot; all right ?
there &apos;s no one better . there &apos;s no one greater .
oh , please , god . don &apos;t vamp .
okay , maybe i &apos;ll talk to chandler .
and maybe he &apos;d like to get married at 007 o &apos;clock .
all right . i will give you 10 extra minutes.that is it .
that &apos;s great ! thank you so much .
well , we &apos;re in luck . the tux fits perfectly .
chandler , that jacket , it &apos;s way too big .
oh , that &apos;s okay . the pants are way too small .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetie . you cannot wear that .
now this means ross is gonna be the only cool one .
something , by the way , i never thought i would say .
dude , take that thing off . you look like a fool .
come next door . i got some minister headdresses i want you to see .
how can you not remember us kissing ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t remember a lot of things that never happened .
remember , we were on the sleeping porch ? we couldn &apos;t stop giggling .
our coconuts kept knocking together .
somewhere joey &apos;s head is exploding .
i don &apos;t want to make you uncomfortable ...
... but i told phoebe it happened , and she doesn &apos;t believe me .
i &apos;m sorry . i mean , if i thought it happened , i would say it .
maybe i passed out and you did stuff to me while i was sleeping .
no !
all right .
okay , fine .
you don &apos;t have to admit it because i know that it happened .
okay !
you have to admit it ! we kissed ! say it !
it &apos;s okay , you don &apos;t have to do this . i believe you .
if you say you kissed melissa , then you kissed melissa .
thank you , phoebe .
okay .
but she didn &apos;t .
i know .
you carry that around ?
yes . i find it to be something of a conversation piece .
between you and ... ?
gunther .
why don &apos;t we put them on ?
get a picture of batman and james bond , together .
i would , but my pants are a little tight .
a little tight ? i could see 00 and 7 in those things .
well , that stinks .
i was looking forward to wearing our celebrity tuxes together .
so you &apos;re not gonna be wearing yours ?
are you kidding ? it &apos;s batmars tux !
let me try it on .
okay . but just the jacket . 00 and 7 are not getting in there .
holy double @-@ vented comfort , batman !
what &apos;s this ?
an invitation to the at first sight premiere ?
val kilmer didn &apos;t wear this in batman .
he wore it to the premiere of a fruity love story where he was a blind guy .
let me see that .
oh , man .
the only super power you have is the slightly heightened sense of smell .
can i talk to you guys for a second ?
i give up . whatever you want , you can have it .
you want to sing a song or do a dance ?
you want your mom at the altar screaming racial slurs ? i don &apos;t care .
i just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents .
they &apos;re so happy to be a part of your special day .
tell them we &apos;re glad they &apos;re coming .
i will . oh , check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony !
i wear it like this when i marry you guys.and then this ...
... is for party time .
it happened . i am telling you it happened .
it was great meeting you .
and , rachel ? i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll be calling you because ...
... you know , you &apos;ve gotten weird .
take care , you guys .
wait a minute . okay , look .
that night was the one wild thing i &apos;ve ever done in my life .
i won &apos;t let you take it away .
so if you don &apos;t remember that , maybe you &apos;ll remember this ...
oh , my god . you love me .
what ?
of course i remember . i think about it all the time .
i can still hear the coconuts knocking together ...
i didn &apos;t want to tell you , because i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d return my love ...
look who &apos;s being suddenly shy .
you have to feel what i feel .
nobody can kiss that good and not mean it .
i &apos;m just a good kisser .
shut up .
i &apos;m sorry .
you don &apos;t have to be sorry .
i &apos;m obviously kidding .
i &apos;m not in love with you . i &apos;m not in love with her .
i don &apos;t hear coconuts banging together .
i don &apos;t picture your face when i make love to my boyfriend .
anyway , i gotta go .
a kiss goodbye ?
no ? okay .
i mean , i had no idea that that would ...
what the hell was that ?
just wanted to see what all the fuss was about .
and ?
i &apos;ve had better .
i found one that fits .
well , you know what they say ? 23rd time &apos;s a charm .
look at you , all handsome .
whose is it ?
does it matter ?
all that matters is that you look so handsome .
whose is it ?
i don &apos;t want to say .
come on , i don &apos;t care . whose is it ?
