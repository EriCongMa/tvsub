第五季第十五集
Shows your 30,000 votes are fraudulent.
So you want me to bury him?
Do what you want.
I'm not owning this decision.
That is you and Jim Moody conversing in private.
I'm not interested in you.
I want Peter Florrick.
All you have to do is testify against him.
Did you kill Dani Littlejohn?
No.
Is there any way your skin could've ended up under her fingernails?
No.
Then you're innocent.
So why do I feel so nervous?
You all right?
Now, let me tell you exactly what the defense is going to say.
That the DNA can't be trusted.
Mr. Gardner's gonna pound his desk and say loudly,
so that you know that it's important,
"Garbage in, garbage out."
Well, I'm glad Mr. Polmar gave you a preview of my defense,
it'll save me time.
You'll notice though,
that I'm not pounding my desk,
or yelling wildly.
Simple fact is, I don't need to.
I have a client who is innocent.
Mr. Grant tried to rape Dani Littlejohn
and when she resisted, he killed her.
Now, how do I know that Mr. Grant did this?
There were no video cameras there.
Well, luckily, science has provided its own video camera.
In her last desperate moments,
Dani scratched Mr. Grant,
leaving his skin under her fingernails.
This young girl's brave last act
did not save her life,
but it did catch her killer.
Here's the thing about DNA...
whatever you touch,
whether you pick up a soda can, or a garden hose,
you leave a small trace of yourself.
A small trace of your DNA.
There, I just left a small trace of my DNA.
Now, ma'am, if you were to touch it in the same place,
a small trace of my cells may end up on you.
Now, Mr. Gardner will attempt to explain away this DNA
in many exotic ways and in fact,
like any good defense attorney,
he will leave this court and argue in another court
that DNA is absolutely infallible.
Jeffrey never knew Dani Littlejohn, never met her,
never even said hello to her on campus.
Now, Mr. Grant and Ms. Littlejohn, in fact,
were members of the same off-campus club.
This club, was run by a campus math professor,
so Mr. Polmar's...
And what about Mr. Grant's alibi?
He was sleeping in his dorm room...
but no one saw him.
And possibly most damning of all,
the police arrested someone else for this murder.
Objection.
Come on up.
That was a little bit unsubtle.
Need to keep the jury awake.
You said I couldn't mention the man's name, Your Honor.
No, I said you couldn't mention the man himself.
Your Honor, it goes to my theory of the case.
Oh, yeah, please, let's hear the theory of the case.
The police were so embarrassed by arresting the wrong man
a year earlier, they railroaded my client.
No. This isn't about the cop's motive,
this is about you putting doubt in the mind of the jury
and I want you to cut it out.
Yes, Your Honor.
Good. Now, are you done?
With my opening argument? Yes, Your Honor.
Good. Now, step the hell back.
You should've taken the plea, Will.
Okay. We're gonna recess for lunch.
I'll see you back here in 90 minutes.
Jeffrey, remember what I said.
It's a marathon, it's not a sprint.
They think I'm guilty.
Everyone will take you're guilty
until I present my evidence.
Hold it together and don't look away,
you meet their eyes.
Everything all right?
I was just thinking, none of this existed six months ago.
Yeah... it's a real firm.
Thank you.
For?
Making me do this.
Alicia?
I'm seeing Kalinda.
You're...? - Yeah.
Okay.
Now, she's trying to dig up stuff on our firm...
so...
I thought I should come clean to you.
Okay. But...
you're not giving her anything?
No. No. No.
Good.
You look concerned.
Um... no, I just thought...
When you say you're seeing her...?
I thought she was gay.
Bi... or something.
Good. None of my business.
You think this is the way Will and Diane talk?
We just need a shot of bourbon.
I'll get some.
What?
Justice.
You want me to stay?
No. That's okay.
Mr. Dubeck, hello.
Mrs. Florrick.
I hope you don't mind this small interruption.
Would it matter if I did?
It would matter to me.
I won't take a minute. I-I won't even sit.
Sondra, can you call this phone in five minutes
and let me know I have a phone call?
That isn't necessary.
You represented your husband, the governor,
in the legal matters surrounding his election?
I think you know that I did.
Yes. I know you did.
Given that, the Office of Public Integrity
is investigating matters having to do with a stuffed ballot box.
A ballot box I knew nothing about.
A ballot box you argued for in court.
No, I argued against.
Then argued for.
Which is why I advise you
to submit to a voluntary deposition.
Really?
You advise me?
You did nothing wrong.
Your husband did nothing wrong.
The best way to clear this up is to speak on the record.
Or you'll leak it to the press?
No.
But... I do have a witness who will go on the record.
Another lawyer.
Who?
Will Gardner.
I doubt that.
If I were you, I would get on the record first.
Here's my card.
Call me by this time tomorrow.
I think that's your fictional call.
Talk to you soon.
We can claim with 99.9 percent certainty
that this DNA comes from Mr. Grant.
And did you find any other evidence of DNA
around or on the body?
No. Only Mr. Grant's.
And the quantity of the DNA under the victim's fingernails
was consistent...
with a defensive struggle?
That is correct.
And you'd be able to...?
Where'd you get it?
Campus security.
They were sympathetic.
Kalinda, I could kiss you.
Not here.
Listen, I-I need to talk to you later.
Sure, about what?
Later.
So, Mr. Vail...
Actually, Dr. Vail.
My apologies, Dr. Vail.
You have no doubt about the providence of this DNA?
With all DNA work, sir, we leave ourselves a degree of doubt...
but the doubt here is 0.00001.
Thank you, sir.
And now I believe Mr. Gardner
would like to talk to you about Touch DNA.
I do! Thank you, Finn.
Now that the prosecutor has brought it up,
what is Touch DNA?
DNA that is transferred via skin cells
when an object is handled or touched.
And how many skin cells does a person shed every day?
Approximately 400,000 skin cells.
Wow... that's a lot.
So, if I handled this book on my desk,
Introduction to Litigation... it was a gift from Mr. Polmar...
Well, you told me you'd finally read it.
Now, if I handled this book...
and I hand it to you...
am I transferring cells?
You could be.
You would have to hold it for some time
and it would be a better absorbent
if the cover were cloth.
As this one is?
Yes.
That would transfer your cells.
Your Honor, I've had some late arriving evidence
and unfortunately, I haven't had time to put it on slides.
That's all right.
We can struggle without technology today.
The last day of Dani Littlejohn's life,
she checked out a research book
from her advanced sociology class.
This is her at 3:25 P.M.,
as seen from the library surveillance cameras.
Do you see her there?
I do.
Now,
this was a book
all the sociology classes needed to share,
so a student couldn't take it out of the library,
they had to return it after reading the chapter...
Mr. Gardner appears to be testifying here,
Your Honor.
He does at that.
Is there a question
swimming around in all those statements?
Yes, Your Honor.
A few hours earlier, at 12:39,
the same book was checked out by this person.
Do you recognize him?
It looks like Jeffrey Grant.
It is, actually.
Now, this sociology book,
an old book, had a cloth cover.
Is it possible, that the DNA at question here,
was transferred via the cloth cover of this book?
It could, but to get under the victim's fingernails,
she would've had to grip the book quite tightly.
Yes, but as you say, it's possible.
It's certainly possible.
Can you see that, Mr. Polmar?
I can, Mr. Gardner, thank you.
He wanted an answer in 24 hours?
Or he'll depose Will.
It's a bluff.
Will won't break attorney-client privilege.
What if they offer him immunity?
For what?
Conspiracy to commit voter fraud.
He saw a videotape.
He argued against the votes, too.
Yeah, but he buried that video.
I think I should do it.
The voluntary deposition?
It's the only way to control the questions.
I'm in my rights to answer any questions
I want and refuse any due to attorney-client privilege.
Even if I refuse to answer any questions,
I will know what he's asking Will.
Good, good.
Do you need a lawyer?
No, I have Cary.
Cary Agos?
You sure he's up to it?
He's up to it.
What do you have?
Me? Nothing. You know,
just a song in my heart.
Damn it.
Thank you for returning, Doctor.
Now, if you wanted to avoid leaving Touch DNA,
how could you do it?
If I wanted to avoid it?
Well, the best way would be to
remove the top layer of dead cells on your skin.
Through washing hands?
Yes.
Or some kind of solvent or alcohol-based cleanser.
Or chlorine?
Yes. A chlorine-based wash would be quite effective.
Wouldn't chlorine also be effective at washing away
any result from Touch DNA?
Yes, it would.
My apologies, Your Honor.
This evidence arrived so late,
I, too, didn't have time to transfer it to a monitor.
It's like Perry Mason here with all this late-arriving stuff.
Go ahead.
Would you please tell me who you see in this photo, sir?
It looks like the victim, Dani Littlejohn.
It is in fact. At the college swimming pool.
Could you tell me the timecode
of the campus surveillance camera?
It says 5:12...- P.M., that's right.
So this would be after
Mr. Gardner's library photo of Ms. Littlejohn
handling the cloth sociology book?
Yes, an hour and a half later.
Let me take this by the jury.
So, if Ms. Littlejohn went swimming in a chlorinated pool,
after she'd handled the book positively doused
with Touch DNA, would that eliminate any effects
of Touch DNA on her body?
It would, definitely.
And so the DNA underneath Ms. Littlejohn's fingernails
would still most likely come
from a defensive wound that night.
Objection! Beyond the scope.
Sure, you can have that one. Sustained.
Did you have any more questions?
It's my fault. I should have checked.
We gotta start over.
How did his DNA end up on her?
Okay, I'm on it.
It's somewhere in here.
Dani Littlejohn got out of the campus pool at 5:12.
Jeffrey Grant's card key has him entering
his dorm room at 7:49 P.M.
They had to cross somewhere in there.
Kalinda?
So Grant had his baseball game at 6:30.
He was injured at 7:00. Went to the emergency room
and was released at 7:30.
Did they cross at the hospital?
Uh, there was no record of Dani visiting the hospital.
So beat the bushes.
What were Dani Littlejohn's exact movements
from her swim until the time of her death?
And how could Jeffrey have crossed with her?
Let's go!
You're starting over?
We had a setback.
We're putting eight associates on it?
Yes.
Hold on, Kalinda.
What about the earlier suspect, the professor?
Dr. Delaney? The judge won't allow any mention of him.
Do we think he did it?
Who, Jeffrey?
No, the professor.
Do we think Jeffrey did it?
I-I don't know.
Well, what is the plea on the table?
It's off the table. Jeffrey rejected it.
What was the plea on the table?
Eight years.
You think I've lost my perspective?
No, I just think eight years is preferable to life.
Jeffrey is 21.
He'll be out before his 30th birthday.
He rejected it.
I better go.
No, you're fine, Kalinda.
Well, your defense seems
to be taking for granted his innocence.
What if he's not? What's your fallback?
The jury believed Touch DNA.
They looked at Jeffrey and they wanted
to believe he didn't do it.
All we need to do is hint at cross between Jeffrey
and the victim somewhere
where his DNA could have ended up on her.
This isn't a crusade, Diane.
I like the kid.
I think he's innocent.
I feel bad he's having the crap beaten out of him in holding,
but I'm playing this smart.
Okay. Tell me if you need my help.
I'll be in the courtroom down from yours.
On what?
The hedge fund... Vonerich. Another DUI.
Keeping the world safe for drunk CEOs.
It's my new motto.
Are, uh, are they okay? Jeffrey's parents?
I understand, Mr. Grant,
I know, but your son is mid-trial.
The Grants. Their son... they want a second opinion.
Uh, no, I'm sorry. Look, Will Gardner is
Lockhart/Gardner's top litigator.
No, I'm sorry, sir, but you're in good hands.
Thank you.
Wow, you were laying it on thick.
Just cooling things down.
So... will you?
You want me as your lawyer?
Yeah.
Why? You sound incredulous.
Wouldn't you want me as your lawyer?
I'm joking, I'm joking!
Yes!
Yes.
I'll arrange a date and time for the deposition.
Good.
I have the correspondents' luncheon tomorrow.
Sometime before that?
Okay.
Where you going?
Court.
You offering a second opinion?
You were with Dani on that last day swimming, right?
I was.
And afterward.
What did you guys do afterward?
She met me at the study hall.
You ever see this person there?
No, but it's a big campus.
Of course.
And do you know where Dani went after that?
No. She just finished her coffee and headed off.
Uh, coffee? She had a coffee?
Like a Starbucks coffee?
No, a campus one.
Okay, Kalinda, thanks. Keep on it.
Jeffrey, we may have a lead on Dani's whereabouts.
We think she was buying coffee at the campus coffee shop
on 5:30 or so. Were you there?
Let me say this before you answer.
We need to find someplace your Touch DNA could've ended up
under Dani's fingernails after her swimming,
and all we can find is this coffee shop.
So I have to ask you again,
were you in this coffee shop around that time?
It makes sense that you would be.
I'm gonna say yes. I don't remember.
But you might have?
I might have.
Good. Let me run with that.
The more you firm up your memory the better.
You still having trouble in holding?
Yeah.
I can talk to someone.
No, they'll just put me in solitary.
I'd kill myself in solitary.
This is the dorm here.
Mr. Grant's dorm?
Yes. And the body was discovered here.
Now, you found that Mr. Grant's card key had logged him in
7:49 p.M., but the murder didn't happen until 9:15.
How do you explain this?
This door here, it's a fire exit,
but students keep it propped open with a chair.
This is how Mr. Grant could have had access to the crime scene
while bypassing the card key system.
And did you check out Mr. Grant's alibi?
That he was in his dorm room sleeping?
Yes, there were no witnesses.
Thank you, Detective. Nothing further.
Detective, why did it take you a year
to catch my client?
Why? We were being careful.
But you must've questioned students in this dorm
building with the propped-open door?
No.
You didn't? Why was that?
We were pursuing another lead.
I see.
So it took you a year to find my client.
Well, you must have been very busy.
Yes, we were.
You were busy with other cases?
And this case.
It takes you a while to clear cases, is that it?
Look, we had someone else in our sights.
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
I didn't bring it up!
He cowed the witness into defending...
I didn't cow anyone! He volunteered!
Come on up.
The witness brought up the other suspect
to defend his inactivity.
After being badgered,
Your Honor.
I would agree, Mr. Polmar,
but it's now part of Detective Rodriguez's testimony.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Don't suck up. Step back.
Detective,
who was this first suspect you pursued?
Dr. Stephan Delaney.
He's a math professor at Chicago Poly-Tech.
I see. And why did you first suspect him?
What's going on?
The Grants called me for a second opinion on your trial.
You're kidding me.
No. I told them no.
Then why are you here?
I decided to warn you.
I was thinking if I was in your shoes
and I had a client calling behind my back,
I would want to know.
Alicia.
Thanks.
Hey, we might have our differences,
but you're the better lawyer.
I am, aren't I?
And the more humble.
Mr. and Mrs. Grant,
if you want another lawyer, I'll get you a list of other lawyers,
but don't go behind my back.
Not during trial. Do you understand?
We were just nervous.
I understand that. We all are. Do you want to make a change?
No.
No.
Good.
Thank you, Dr. Delaney.
Now, why did Dani Littlejohn stop coming to your B-Plus Club?
Well, she stopped getting B-pluses.
And did she express her worry about another student in the club?
Yes. Jeffrey Grant.
That is such a lie.
Mr. Grant,
not another word.
Our apologies, Your Honor.
But Mr. Grant insists
that he never met Dani Littlejohn.
To your knowledge, would that be false?
I'm sorry, but to my knowledge that is false.
They were both in my B-Plus Club
and, I believe, socialized there.
Now, let me just ask you this question,
because I know Mr. Gardner's chomping at the bit
and I don't want to disappoint him.
Did you kill Dani Littlejohn?
No.
But the police questioned you.
Yes.
I was the last one to see her.
Alive.
She was in my study group.
But you have an alibi?
Yes.
At the time of Dani's death,
I was with my ex-wife.
Your ex-wife.
Thank you, Dr. Delaney.
校园咖啡店
Oh, yeah.
That's... that girl...
Dani Littlejohn.
Right.
Uh, do you remember the day she died?
Oh, yeah. Last year.
That was... awful.
She used to come in a lot.
And you were working that afternoon.
Uh, yeah.
1:00-7:00.
Right.
What time did she come in?
Dani?
Yeah.
Uh, she didn't come in. Not that day.
She didn't come in?
Uh... look, are you sure?
Because we have someone who witnessed her
with a coffee cup that came from here.
Yeah, I saw her standing outside,
but a friend of hers brought her the coffee.
Do you remember seeing this student out there, too?
Yeah, I know him.
But he wasn't outside with her.
But you can't be sure.
No, I'm... pretty sure.
Right.
Sorry.
I can lie, if you want.
If you want me to say I saw them together.
It's fine.
Will, it's bad news.
Did you check the surveillance video?
Yeah.
Littlejohn's roommate went into the coffee shop...
she stayed outside.
Maybe she ran into Jeffrey outside.
Will...
I think he did it.
The murder weapon, the cinder block...
how much did it weigh?
About 18 pounds.
Check with Jeffrey's doctor.
He was injured pitching that night, right?
The doctor who examined him.
Maybe he couldn't lift it.
Okay, I'll ask.
Good.
What's up with you?
You wanted to talk?
Yeah.
How long do you need to replace me?
How long do I need?
You're leaving?
Yeah.
You going to Florrick-Agos?
No.
Then what?
Just, I wanted to...
I don't know, wanted to do something different.
What, farming?
Will, I don't want to be doing this for the next 20 years.
This isn't about money?
Nope.
Is it about Alicia?
Is... What?
Her leaving.
No.
Okay.
I'm gonna be honest.
You know this is crap.
I know this is crap.
Every few months, you do this.
And this time, I am serious.
You and I were built for this, Kalinda.
It's what we do.
Now, we can look at normal people
and want to be like them...
but we can't, really.
Is that supposed to be a pep talk?
Because it's terrible.
Okay, look...
you take a few months off.
Go have a life.
But I'm telling you right now:
you will be bored sick.
Life is overrated, and
you'll miss it.
That feeling you get
when you figure something out...
You live for that.
Anyway... I'll miss you.
There aren't many people I like left.
There.
Was that a better pep talk?
It's okay.
You want a hug?
Stupid.
Good morning, Mrs. Florrick.
Mr. Dubeck.
According to our pre-agreed ground rules,
I will be taping
this deposition...
Voluntary deposition.
Yes. Voluntary deposition.
And we've agreed to review and correct any mistakes
in the fine copy.
And...
I will be taping this interview, also.
Good.
So, then, we're...
all ready?
We seem to be.
Okay. Did you discuss
your voluntary deposition
with anyone before today?
Yes.
Who?
Eli Gold,
my husband, Governor Peter Florrick,
and my lawyer, Cary Agos.
Did you discuss it with Will Gardner, too?
No.
Really?
Because you were observed
meeting with Will Gardner yesterday,
Tuesday the 15th, at the criminal courthouse.
I was "Observed"?
Yes.
When I was being followed,
I was "Observed"?
Yes. Mm-hmm.
And for how long have I been being... "Observed"?
35 hours.
And will I continue to be "Observed"?
I don't know.
I will be readying
an order of protection right after this meeting.
Good.
So you met with Will Gardner yesterday,
but you did not discuss your testimony with him?
Her "Interview" with him.
That's correct.
I didn't discuss it.
What did you discuss?
His current murder trial.
I told him
that the parents of his client
came to me for a second opinion.
When your men are trailing me
and they're too far away to hear,
just have them signal
and I'll talk louder.
Did Will Gardner show you this videotape?
No. He didn't?
No.
You'll have to excuse my incredulity,
but it seems to me that you and Mr. Gardner share...
almost everything.
Your incredulity...
is excused.
Do you have any other questions,
Mr. Dubeck, or is that it?
I was just giving Mrs. Florrick
a chance to reconsider her response.
No, I'm good.
You and Mr. Gardner are lovers, isn't that correct?
Excuse me. What does that have to do with anything?
The relationship between two lawyers
on Governor Florrick's legal team
bears a direct relationship to... - No.
No, it does not.
And I'm calling a halt to this interview right now.
It's okay, Cary.
Mr. Dubeck...
I've been at this now for five years.
Investigations, recriminations,
personal questions, innuendo.
And every time...
every single time...
I know the investigator is in trouble
when he makes it personal...
just as you did now.
I know that he doesn't have the facts.
You're losing, Mr. Dubeck.
Any other questions?
Yes, Jeffrey Grant, the guy on trial.
He was in here.
And you treated him?
Yes, I treated him. Why?
He had a sprain?
Oh, yes, he was in quite a bit of pain.
His right arm.
Do you think he could've lifted this?
It's about 18 pounds.
Mm, he might be able to,
with difficulty.
It would be painful.
Is this about the murder?
Yeah.
I treated her that night, too.
Sorry, you...
you treated... Dani Littlejohn?
Yes.
You treated both Dani and Jeffrey?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Okay, sir, now, this may hurt.
I know.
I'm sorry. Let's get him up to X ray on the third floor,
and then we'll determine if he needs to go to surgery or not. Um...
Doctor...
Sorry, Doctor.
When Jeffrey was brought in here,
did you examine him in here?
Sorry, I'm a little busy.
Just one question.
Was Jeffrey examined in the emergency room?
Uh, yes.
Right. And Dani Littlejohn...
when she was brought in, where was she?
In the operating theatre downstairs.
Yeah, but was she ever on any of these beds?
We change the sheets on these beds after every patient.
I understand that, but is-is there any way, Doctor,
that Jeffrey's sheets from earlier on that night
could've come into contact with Dani?
No.
Would you excuse me?
Look... check the paramedic.
The same one that brought in Jeffrey Grant for his sprain
brought in Littlejohn later that night.
Thank you.
So the first time you discovered
there were 30,000 votes
in that ballot box for your husband
was in court, on the eve of the election.
No.
Then when did you first discover it?
I never discovered it.
There was never 30,000 votes for my husband.
Oh, I see.
Then when did you first discover there were...
28,158 votes for your husband?
When you showed me the video.
And when did you first see this video?
What is this video?
Another surveillance video.
This one's from the 23rd Precinct, early voting.
Um, I've never seen that video
until this moment.
And this video?
Just to clarify,
this is the very first time
Mrs. Florrick has seen these videos
and we have no knowledge what they signify.
They signify that Mr. Florrick stole an election.
This is not about 30,000 votes.
This was a conspiracy.
A conspiracy of middle men, sir.
Peter had no knowledge of these actions.
Alicia...
Well, that's the question, isn't it?
What did the governor know, when did he know it?
That's what makes Will Gardner's testimony so interesting.
He took this video to the governor,
and the governor did nothing.
Thank you so much. And Alicia is needed
at a correspondents' luncheon.
You can bury your head in the sand, Mrs. Florrick,
but once Will Gardner testifies,
the dominoes will start falling.
Alicia, this way.
I talked to the paramedics.
They never changed the sheet.
The DNA was transferred on the stretcher.
Will the paramedics testify?
Yeah. I just need a few hours.
Good, I'll get 'em.
Okay.
Kalinda.
Yeah?
That's why you can't leave.
Good news, Jeffrey, great news.
Oh, my God, when did that happen?
All rise!
Did you have any more questions, counselor?
No, Your Honor,
I tender the witness.
No, questions, Your Honor,
but I request a sidebar.
Come on up. What do I do?
Let me talk to the judge. Solitary is better than this.
What is it now, counselor?
Your Honor, we have a new piece of evidence
that would require a short overnight recess.
A new piece? Really?
My Gosh.
Dramatics, Your Honor.
What is this new piece?
We believe the DNA
was transferred through a paramedics gurney.
Come on. Seriously?
There is precedent for this.
An Oakland man was convicted of first-degree murder
and spent two years
in prison before it was overturned.
Precedent?
Your Honor, at the very most, this is a DUI. That's all.
My client is a respected businessman.
He's shown a clear sense of...
Shots fired at Cook County courthouse.
Everyone stay put.
What is this?
What's going on?
I don't know.
Will's court.
I know.
Look, stay here.
Stay down!
Orders to lock this down. How many?
I don't know. I only saw one,
but there might others.
Did the lawyers get out?
Where are they?
I think one ran behind the judge's bench,
but there could be two others.
Will! Damn it, Kalinda, back off!
My boss is in there.
Don't shoot! Hey, hands in the air!
Down! Get down! Don't shoot!
I've got someone in here! I need help! Over here!
We're coming for you! Just hang tight!
No, no, we don't know where they are.
She said she saw him heading behind the bench.
I have SWAT on its way.
We wait here.
How many shots were fired?
Tactically, we don't know how many.
It could have been anybody.
Negative, haven't seen him yet...
Have them get back to me.
We got blood loss! I can't wait!
Operations, seal the exit.
We need a bus forthwith.
Kalinda! Damn it! Get back here!
Kalinda, get down! There could be more than one.
He needs help.
Will!
Paramedics!
Excuse me, could you...
Hi. Where is he?
They-they took him in there a few minutes ago.
Is he all right?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Excuse me. Um...
Have you seen Will Gardner?
He was one of the people shot in the courthouse.
I'm sorry. Those aren't my patients.
Do you know where he is?
No. I can find out for you. Just wait here.
We got you, son.
You're gonna be all right, buddy.
His family, his sisters,
I have to call them.
Um, I'll do that.
No, I will.
Alicia?
At this time, I'd like to ask you all to please take your seats.
He had other tapes?
Yes, three other surveillance tapes.
With Jim Moody?
No! People I didn't recognize.
He's coming after you, Eli.
As long as it's performed by underlings, we're okay.
Howard, Michael,
have you met Alicia Florrick?
Oh, nice to meet you.
I mean, I just saw him a few hours ago. He was...
He was happy.
The case was working.
I got two down and counting.
The vics from the courthouse. Yeah, they're both here.
No.
No.
He doesn't look like himself.
I have to get Alicia.
Oh, this is good weed!
I want more of this! Where can I get more of this?!
Right here, direct for your correspondents.
No, man, you can't get it here.
Not in Illinois.
We're gonna have to go to Colorado.
But-but I got bad joints.
I need the medical marijuana now!
I was gonna say something,
but I just, I just can't remember what it was.
You know, I mean,
I don't know why everybody's fighting.
You need to calm down. You're all right.
It's the only thing that takes the pain away.
You need to call the Governor.
Get on the phone! Tell him to pass a law!
Or his, a-a-a, da-da-da, wife.
Alicia Florrick,
she's a good sport.
Imagine if the governor got a little high
and had to talk to his wife.
He'd be like, "Honey, I'm stoned."
Kalinda?
I got him.
Uh, Eli...
uh, I-I need to talk to Alicia.
She's on the dais. She can't come now. What's wrong?
I-I need to talk to her, Eli.
Kalinda, she's in the middle of the correspondents' luncheon.
Eli, Will's dead.
There was a shooting in the courthouse,
and he got caught up in the crossfire.
I need to speak to Alicia.
Yes. Just a second.
You want brownies? You're definitely getting a brownie.
It's gonna, it's gonna be like a brownie.
You're going to eat it. It's gonna be good, ja.
You know, you're going to chomp on it, ja,
and then you get all crazy in the head.
There's a call for you.
Now?
Yes.
You have to take it.
Eli, what is it?
When you start talking about medical marijuana...
Hello?
You're the one who went to the judge
insisting the deposition could only be today.
So let's get the judge on the line!
But I don't think he's gonna be in a giving mood.
What do you want?
I want to get out my aggressions and my anger
by destroying your client.
Now sit down.
I said sit the hell down.
I don't know what you think you're doing.
I'm making an executive decision.
I'm the ranking partner here.
You're no Will Gardner, Diane.
You'll only hurt yourself trying to be.
Well, then fasten your seat belts.
We're heading for a lot of hurt.
Oh, wait a minute.
Sorry, I...
lost my pen.
Almost got it. Almost.
No, I can't. I'm sorry. Would you mind?
If you think your life would've been better with Will,
you are kidding yourself.
Stop it, Peter!
No, I'm not gonna let you throw away this marriage
because you have some idealized notion of a man
who you're not even sure cared about you!
You're a bastard.
And you're a selfish bitch,
but you know what?!
We're all that we have.
You're gonna have to learn to trust me real quick.
I'm the new Will.
You're not the new Will.
