the reaper .
the boston reaper ?
if you stop hunting me ,
i &apos;ll stop hunting them .
i don &apos;t make deals . i &apos;m the guy
who hunts guys like you .
you &apos;ll regret this .
you should have made a deal .
are you sure that we &apos;re in danger ?
yes .
tell them i &apos;ll protect them like they &apos;re my own .
i &apos;m not leaving the team ,
i &apos;m just no longer in charge .
you are .
me ?
george foyet was the ninth victim
and the only one who survived the reaper .
he inflicted those wounds on himself .
george foyet is the reaper .
one of the inmates has received 2 envelopes
in the last 2 days .
i &apos;ll get this to the lab .
he &apos;s torturing him .
it &apos;s great to see you squirm , agent hotchner .
get out of here .
go see if they need help downstairs .
&quot; he who fights with monsters
&quot; might take care lest he thereby become a monster .
&quot; and if you gaze for long into an abyss ,
the abyss gazes also into you . &quot;
friedrich nietzsche .
please say your name and rank for the record .
supervisory special agent jennifer jareau ,
communications liaison for the behavioral analysis unit
in quantico , virginia .
and how long have you been a member of the bau ?
6 years .
could you speak up , please ?
sorry . 6 years .
and have you worked under agent hotchner the entire time ?
no , ma &apos;am . i currently
report to acting unit chief derek morgan .
who took over the unit because agent hotchner &apos;s
ability to lead the team had become compromised .
i--i don &apos;t believe that &apos;s the reason .
you have a different opinion ?
it &apos;s not just an opinion .
you have a different understanding ?
ssa hotchner voluntarily stepped down
so we could continue to do our jobs unhindered .
how would you describe agent hotchner &apos;s recent behavior ?
driven .
driven . agent jareau , your entire team is on the line
if i cannot reconcile an adequate account
of agent hotchner &apos;s investigation into george foyet .
we were all investigating the reaper .
ssa hotchner was not the only one ,
especially after he sent us that calling card .
the newspaper articles he mailed to karl arnold .
2 letters from 2 different locations .
they ramped us all back up again .
i should just start at the beginning .
foyet had done a lot of injury to himself
in the original string of killings ,
in an effort to paint himself as a victim
and throw us off the investigation .
as a result , he became dependent upon
a large number of extremely strong medications .
we &apos;d been searching the country for patients
with that exact prescription combination ,
but we hadn &apos;t had any luck .
the envelopes foyet mailed to arnold are due back from the lab .
they &apos;re flagged urgent .
gina &apos;s here with them now .
they &apos;re processed . clean . no prints , no dna .
she says they &apos;re clean .
yeah , of course they are .
anderson , listen to me .
i don &apos;t care if you have to drive
to the postmaster general &apos;s house .
i want to know where those postmarks were applied
before the team gets in .
yes , ma &apos;am . copy that .
found it .
he &apos;s still not taking his bottle .
here . let me try .
can you take your bottle , please ?
can you take--oh ...
thank you so much .
oh , yeah . you are definitely mama &apos;s little boy , huh ?
just like his daddy .
next .
hey , if you have to go , go ahead .
i can take care of this .
i don &apos;t know what i would do if i were in hotch &apos;s shoes .
if i ever had to say good @-@ bye to you and henry because--
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
we &apos;re not .
you &apos;re tracking the prescriptions ,
you &apos;re tracking the postmarks .
aside from another body landing on your doorstep ,
you &apos;re doing all you can .
i hope so ,
for hotch &apos;s sake .
next .
that &apos;s us .
here we are .
oh , actually , there should be 2 prescriptions .
we filled the antibiotics ,
but we &apos;re out of the antihistamine .
you know , crushing half a claritin
would do the job just the same .
save you a couple bucks , too .
wait--excuse me ,
are there a lot of
over @-@ the @-@ counter medications
that can be substituted for prescriptions ?
too many to count .
most of the time , it &apos;s just a matter of dosage .
foyet &apos;s meds--we have been tracking the entire combination .
what if he &apos;s been using over @-@ the @-@ counter meds
for some of it to mask his purchases ?
ok , narrow the search . focus on the meds
he can &apos;t substitute . good work .
just got a call
from the postmaster general inspector &apos;s office .
already ?
i &apos;m not just a pretty face .
is garcia in yet ?
are you sure ?
bacon doughnut . you &apos;ll never be the same .
i can totally think of more palatable ways
to up my adventure quotient , thank you .
o ... m ... g .
it gets better every time .
kevin , you need to leave right now .
would you like some water ?
no , thank you , ma &apos;am .
are you all right ?
i--i &apos;m just not , uh ,
comfortable with any of this .
it &apos;s not ok .
what do you mean ?
in my opinion ,
everyone is asking the wrong questions .
doesn &apos;t anybody care
about what the reaper did to them ,
how many people he hurt ?
all anyone seems to care about is ...
this just isn &apos;t right .
do you think that agent hotchner was acting ...
agitated or unreasonable ?
he ...
no , no , he--
he was freaked out about his family .
which , considering what happened ,
i &apos;d say was perfectly reasonable .
the foyet letters came from fredericksburg , virginia ,
and westminster , maryland .
we can match the prescription drugs
foyet can &apos;t substitute with a geographic profile
of the 2 cities .
can &apos;t substitute ?
we need you to track the drugs that can &apos;t be emulated
with over @-@ the @-@ counter drugs and can only be dispensed
by a pharmacist , and you need to do it quickly .
foyet doesn &apos;t stay in one place very long .
then kevin needs to stay .
what ?
sir , kevin is an amazing analyst .
i can work almost twice as fast
with him running part of my system .
fine .
these are your screens .
garcia , how long ?
i &apos;ll know once i get into it .
we &apos;re gonna work the geographic profile .
call me when you have something . and hurry .
uh , ok ...
i am gonna start with the ultram--
no--you &apos;re gonna start with the ultram and naproxen .
i &apos;ll work on the rest .
there &apos;s approximately 115 miles
between fredericksburg and westminster .
why mail a letter from 2 cities ?
maybe it &apos;s purely a forensic countermeasure .
he knows that mailing letters close
to home would lead us right to him ,
so he drives far away to mail the
letters to throw us off his scent .
the unabomber did that . so did the 2001 anthrax suspect .
he could have gone anywhere , but he &apos;s trolling the d.c. area .
it makes sense to stay close to hotch .
he stuck around boston to watch shaunessy deteriorate .
not that you &apos;re--
it &apos;s all right . i know he &apos;s been watching me .
it &apos;s part of the reason i stepped down ,
so he &apos;d think i was falling apart .
naproxen is available in generic brands over the counter .
naproxen &apos;s properties can be simulated by aleve .
ultram can be substituted .
ok , oxycontin .
jeez , he &apos;s on that , too ?
yeah , and it &apos;s highly addictive and therefore regulated ,
so there &apos;s no substitute for it .
i know the dea has a problem with it .
you can buy it on the streets if you know where to go .
good point . ok , we &apos;re gonna leave that off the list for now
&apos;cause there &apos;s another way to get it . next up ...
tapazole .
what &apos;s that ?
uh , it treats hyperthyroidism .
hey , what &apos;s wrong with this guy , anyway ?
he stabbed himself--a lot .
stabbed himself ?
yeah . so his body would have permanent internal damage--
work , honey--and he &apos;d need
this prescription to regulate his heart rate ,
keep down the palpitations and the tremors .
and there is no substitute for tapazole .
so if this is our missing link , how do we find him ?
print out every person who &apos;s on this prescription
within a 60 @-@ mile of both cities . the team will do the rest .
i &apos;m gonna use your laptop .
ok , so what are we gonna do about the 2 cities ?
usually we need 3 different points to
get an accurate geographic profile .
that &apos;s all we got right now .
gaithersburg , rockville ,
d.c. , alexandria ,
bowie , annapolis .
where the hell are you , foyet ?
ok , me and the boy found a thyroid medication
that has no substitute over the counter .
you &apos;ve gotta get it from a pharmacist .
but a lot of people are on it .
find the midpoint between the 2 cities
and isolate names in a 25 @-@ mile radius .
153 names .
well , he &apos;s not gonna use his own name .
what kind of aliases should we be looking for ?
he could have easily stolen someone &apos;s identity .
no , he &apos;s a narcissist in love with his own mythology .
he &apos;d use a name connected with the case .
a victim , maybe , a cop .
ok . let &apos;s check the foyet files
for a list of names . and ...
nothing .
wait a minute , guys . foyet likes things to have meaning to him .
the eye of providence ,
the addresses in blood he wrote on
the bus that led us back to him .
maybe he &apos;s doing the same thing with the alias .
like an anagram or something .
you see something , reid ?
not yet .
reid , he named himself the reaper .
there &apos;s a peter rhea in arlington .
once the team located
george foyet &apos;s potential apartment ,
why didn &apos;t the bau enter immediately ?
agent rossi ?
i asked you a question .
gold is still going up .
but knowing when to get out , that &apos;s the trick .
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s the point of all this , erin ?
why ?
so this never happens again .
there is nothing a bureaucrat can do
to make sure that something like this never happens again .
so we just wait for the next bloodbath ?
why did you wait so long
before going to foyet &apos;s apartment ?
we had to be sure he was there .
if we went in and he wasn &apos;t ,
he would know we found him .
of course , the longer we waited ,
the more time he had to ...
it was an impossible decision .
so who made it ?
agent hotchner ?
how much longer do we wait ?
i need to leave that call to someone else .
swat &apos;s getting antsy .
i &apos;ll tell them when it &apos;s time to go .
right now we sit tight . let them know .
these guys are trained to move , not just sit around .
i can &apos;t really say that i blame them .
he may not even be there anymore .
i know . the longer we sit here , the further away he gets .
you make the best call you can , kid .
all right , this is what we &apos;re gonna do .
super .
super .
there &apos;s a leak in the apartment above you .
i need to check your ceiling .
are you getting the signal ?
copy .
no warm bodies .
looks like kitchen table , chair .
is that a laptop on the table ?
it could be useful .
is that food ? get closer to that .
wait , go back . what &apos;s that on the floor ?
yeah . it &apos;s his mail .
go , go , go , go !
hurry up ! let &apos;s go !
what happened ?
he &apos;s not coming back here . he left an untouched meal .
you drop your mail like this when you &apos;re startled ,
when you need to get out of dodge quick .
something tipped him off . he knew we were coming here .
suitcases are open , some clothes are missing .
there &apos;s a safe with a stash of guns in it .
he didn &apos;t even bother to lock them up again .
if he &apos;s in a hurry , he &apos;ll make a mistake .
yeah , but when foyet gets cornered ,
he starts killing .
we &apos;re not gonna let that happen .
we need to get garcia on this .
he is creepy good .
how good ?
he wiped his hard drive .
might have been in a hurry to leave ,
but whatever was on there ,
he did not want us to see it .
garcia , tell me that you &apos;re hacked
in and that you can rebuild it .
watch me work , darling .
hello .
what have you got ?
he had an internet alarm on the name peter rhea .
it alerted him as soon as we ran a check on it .
what else did he wipe ?
garcia , wait a minute . freeze it right there .
oh , my god , isn &apos;t that
that &apos;s the u.s. marshal assigned to my family .
foyet &apos;s been watching him this whole time ?
kassmeyer . leave a message .
sam , it &apos;s aaron . we found foyet &apos;s location ,
but he has surveillance photos of you .
call me for a meet location or we &apos;re on our way to you .
we &apos;re gonna need to deploy another swat unit .
that &apos;s gonna take another half hour .
hotch ?
go . go .
you left for marshal kassmeyer &apos;s house immediately ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
wouldn &apos;t this be a job for a tactical team ?
we felt that it would take too much time
to get authorization for another operation .
we ?
all of us .
don &apos;t you mean agent hotchner wanted that ?
no , i mean all of us wanted that .
i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
and i agree it would be easy for us to blame him .
easy ?
yeah . why not just say it &apos;s his fault
and then we can all just forget about it .
but , uh , the problem is ,
i have an eidetic memory ,
and that &apos;s not what happened .
sam
this is agent rossi , fbi . we need an ambulance .
we have a federal officer down .
i wouldn &apos;t ... i wouldn &apos;t ...
we &apos;re getting an ambulance .
i tried .
hang on .
just hang on .
i &apos;m sorry .
what are you sorry for ?
i ... i tried .
are jack and haley safe ?
sam , tell me what happened .
i don &apos;t know how he got in .
where are they ?
where are they ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m gonna find out ...
one way or another .
sam , i need to understand .
does he know where jack and haley are ?
i didn &apos;t ...
this little piggy ...
look at that . he &apos;s not going anywhere , is he ?
what about her phone number ?
what &apos;s her safe phone number ?
i didn &apos;t ... it won &apos;t matter .
kill me . i &apos;m not telling you anything .
you &apos;re not gonna get off that easy .
i need you alive
so you can tell agent hotchner
that it &apos;s his fault that his family &apos;s dead .
i--i tried , hotch .
gunshot wounds to each leg , one foot ,
he &apos;s missing several fingers , and appears to be badly beaten .
clear out of the way .
get me a c @-@ collar , prep me a saline drip
while i grab a round of vitals .
sam , are you allergic to any medication ?
hotch .
sam , i &apos;m right here .
i tried .
make sure they have a trauma surgeon standing by .
do you believe it was marshal kassmeyer &apos;s fault
that agent hotchner &apos;s family was compromised ?
absolutely not .
you answered that very quickly .
when you &apos;re being tortured , there &apos;s no end in sight ,
except giving them what they want .
and kassmeyer didn &apos;t do that ?
he withstood everything that foyet had .
then tell me exactly what happened .
is he conscious ?
in and out .
sam , it &apos;s aaron .
can you hear me ?
aaron .
i &apos;m right here , sam .
his pressure &apos;s dropping .
10cc morphine going in .
do not sedate me . i need to talk .
sam , does foyet know where jack and haley are ?
i wouldn &apos;t tell him . it doesn &apos;t matter .
let me guess .
the marshals service
doesn &apos;t have anything listed by name .
case numbers only .
the thing is ,
this relocation is a bit of a special favor ,
which tells me that you might bring your work home with you .
who knows ?
maybe even on emergency speed dial .
hello , haley ?
i &apos;m sorry . wrong number .
hello , is haley there ?
uh , uh , no , ma &apos;am . i &apos;m sorry .
it must have been a wrong number .
hello , is haley there ?
hello , haley ?
hello , is haley there ?
sam ?
haley .
ohh--hal--
sorry for using your real name , ma &apos;am .
my name is victor collins .
i &apos;m with the marshals service .
ma &apos;am , we have a problem .
marshal kassmeyer has been killed ,
and we &apos;re afraid your location may have been compromised .
what ?
ma &apos;am , i need you to focus right now .
this is about saving your son .
we &apos;re trying to savejjack . do you understand me ?
yes .
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s more , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m not quite sure how to tell you this , but ...
your ex @-@ husband has been killed as well .
oh , god .
we &apos;re gonna bring you and your son in safe ,
but i &apos;m gonna need your help for this , ok ?
when we &apos;re through speaking , i want you to hang up the phone .
do not attempt to call anybody else .
do you understand me ? it could be intercepted .
yes .
the next thing i need you to do
is buy a disposable cell phone .
get back in your car , call me at this number .
once i know your mobile ,
i &apos;ll give you another number
along with some instructions on how to proceed .
ok .
now , ma &apos;am , i do not want you to worry .
we &apos;re gonna bring you and jack in here safely .
are you ...
are you sure aaron is ...
are you sure ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m terribly sorry .
see you later .
ok .
she &apos;s going to him .
i &apos;m so sorry , hotch .
they &apos;re ready for you .
agent prentiss .
ma &apos;am .
we understand that agent hotchner
managed to separate himself from the rest of the team .
he didn &apos;t &quot; manage &quot; to do that .
when marshal kassmeyer was in the ambulance--
agent hotchner volunteered to ride along .
to get answers before he lost consciousness .
why didn &apos;t you go with him ?
it didn &apos;t seem necessary .
did you tell you that ?
is that what you &apos;re looking for ,
a way to blame this on him ?
what good could that possibly do ?
agent hotchner was looking for an opportunity
to separate himself from the team and he found one .
that isn &apos;t true .
he was desperate and he didn &apos;t want someone
with a clear head to stop him .
is there a question in there somewhere ?
tell me what happened while agent hotchner
was in the ambulance .
we contacted the u.s. marshals .
they said haley was in the wind .
she had dumped her cell phone ,
so there was no way to track her .
and how did agent hotchner react to that news ?
foyet called haley from kassmeyer &apos;s phone .
all right , we &apos;ll get garcia to trace it . jj .
he told her she was compromised and i was dead .
well , have you called her ?
no . he said to throw her phone away and to buy a disposable .
hotch , we &apos;re gonna come get you right now .
no , anderson &apos;s bringing me a car .
you want to meet back at the office ?
i &apos;m hoping that she &apos;s just gonna
call me , at least , to check
foyet posed as a marshal , even called
from a number that haley recognized .
and then he did what gets him off . he scared her .
no , he paralyzed her . he overwhelmed her .
and now she trusts him .
where do you think he would take her ?
witness protection had her living in new jersey .
he has a head start . he could be there now .
garcia &apos;s got a trace .
he &apos;s bouncing between a few towers .
where ?
fairfax county .
he &apos;s still local ?
send the coordinates to my phone .
done .
why isn &apos;t he on his way to new jersey ?
wait , that phone &apos;s on ?
yes .
hotch ?
he hung up .
damn it .
what &apos;s that ?
hotch is calling foyet .
agent hotchner .
if you touch her ...
be gentle , like i was with you ?
what the hell took you so long ?
i was beginning to think this phone was dead or something .
why so quiet ?
you usually lash out when you &apos;re frustrated .
i &apos;m not frustrated . you &apos;re more predictable than you think .
am i ?
you didn &apos;t know where haley was ,
so you made her come to you .
you make me sound lazy .
just another way for you to show control .
oh , that &apos;s terrible .
your mother tried to protect you from your father ,
but she wasn &apos;t strong enough .
and you hated her for that , didn &apos;t you ?
you decided that all women were weak .
those are your words , not mine .
what were you , 9 when you killed them ?
it was a car accident .
that you couldn &apos;t take credit for .
that had to be hard for you .
but poor george got another chance .
the little orphan was saved
by the wealthy , sterile eastside couple , the foyets .
and the story should have ended there .
i don &apos;t believe in fairy tales . do you ?
that &apos;s the thing , george . this isn &apos;t a fairy tale .
you don &apos;t have to write this story .
you don &apos;t have to do any of this .
i know you &apos;re exhausted .
always looking over your shoulder ,
always wondering when the other shoe is gonna drop .
haven &apos;t you gotten what you wanted ?
you &apos;ve set yourself apart from
anybody we &apos;ve ever dealt with .
you &apos;re not just a famous serial killer , you &apos;re the reaper .
we &apos;re gonna study you and your methods for years and years .
you know what i &apos;ve been thinking ?
haley looks pretty good with dark hair .
she &apos;s lost some weight .
must be all the stress you caused her .
where &apos;s the little man ?
oh. there he is .
does he like captain america because of you ?
that &apos;s your wife .
hold , please .
mrs. hotchner .
i &apos;m here .
open the gate and i &apos;ll drive in .
ok .
aaron ?
i really gotta go .
and you still didn &apos;t know where foyet was ?
the phone belonged to a u.s. marshal .
it was designed to bounce between towers ,
so we could not pinpoint his location .
and agent hotchner was driving around aimlessly .
no .
he wasn &apos;t .
we had foyet &apos;s profile ,
and we knew if we followed it ,
we would know where he took hotch &apos;s family .
all right , foyet has to be in control .
he had haley come to him .
yeah , but where would he take her ?
he &apos;d want hotch to find him , to see where he was ,
to see what he did .
which means he ...
he said something on that call
that tells hotch where to go .
reid , what did he say , exactly ?
&quot; haley &apos;s hair looks good dark. she &apos;s lost some weight .
&quot; it must be because of all the stress you caused her .
&quot; where &apos;s the little man ? oh , there he is now .
&quot; do you think he likes captain america because of you ?
&quot; that &apos;s your wife on the other line . hold , please .
hi . open the gate and i &apos;ll drive in . &quot;
open the gate ?
it would be someplace
with the biggest emotional impact for hotch .
and haley has access to the gate .
their house , where they lived together .
of course . foyet planned this all the way to the end .
it &apos;s everything to him .
he wants to take over hotch &apos;s home
to be in control to prove his dominance .
morgan .
he &apos;s going to your house .
i know .
i &apos;m sending out a full tactical deployment , hotch .
good .
we &apos;re on our way .
foyet &apos;s calling hotch .
garcia , can you get us on ?
foyet .
aaron ?
you &apos;re ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
but ... he said that ...
oh , aaron .
he can hear us , right ?
yes .
i am so sorry .
haley , show him no weakness ,
no fear .
i know .
sam told me all about him .
is he , uh--
no , sam is fine .
aaron , aaron , aaron .
is that why your marriage broke up ,
because you &apos;re a liar ?
don &apos;t listen to him , haley .
i have sam &apos;s service phone right here .
they sent out a mass text about his death .
you can take a look if you want .
he &apos;s trying to scare you .
did you even tell her what this was about ?
about the deal ?
he &apos;s just trying to make you angry .
well , she should be . she &apos;s gonna ...
d @-@ i @-@ e
because of your inflated ego .
ignore him , haley .
i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want her to know this part either .
you know , all he had to do was stop looking for me
and you wouldn &apos;t be in this mess .
don &apos;t react .
what is he talking about ?
tell jack i need him working the case .
what ?
tell jack i need him working the case .
jack .
did you hear that ?
hi , daddy .
hi , buddy .
is george a bad guy ?
yes , he is .
jack , i need you on this case with me .
do you understand ?
i need you to work the case with me .
ok , daddy .
jack , hug your mom for me .
mommy hug me too tight .
i &apos;m sorry .
why are you sad ?
oh , i just love you so much .
mommy , i gotta go . i &apos;m working the case .
ok .
he &apos;s so cute .
he &apos;s like a little junior g @-@ man .
i &apos;ll be right up , jackie boy !
is he gone ?
yes .
you &apos;re so strong , haley . you &apos;re stronger than i ever was .
you &apos;ll hurry , right ?
i know you didn &apos;t sign on for this .
neither did you .
i &apos;m sorry for everything .
promise me that you will tell him how we met
and how you used to make me laugh .
haley ...
he needs to know that you weren &apos;t always so serious , aaron .
i want him to believe in love ,
because it is the most important thing .
but you need to show him .
promise me .
i promise .
and i don &apos;t know what happened after that .
after i finish you ...
i &apos;m gonna find that little bastard son of yours
and i &apos;m gonna show him both of his dead parents ,
and i &apos;m gonna tell him that it was all your fault .
and then i &apos;m gonna--aah !
ok . you got--you got me .
i surrender .
hotch ! hotch !
he &apos;s dead .
hotch , stop . come on , stop it .
it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s over , man .
what are you doing ?
i work the case with you , dad .
jack , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re working the case with me .
you know i can always use your help .
i work the case daddy , just like you said .
you did a great job , buddy .
what happened to you , daddy ?
i &apos;m ok . i want you to go outside with ms. jareau . ok ?
come here , sweetheart .
i &apos;m so sorry , hotch .
get out of here . go see if they need help downstairs .
there was nothing i could do for her .
she was already ...
she died fairly quickly .
one of the wounds severed her aorta ,
and they don &apos;t think that she ...
