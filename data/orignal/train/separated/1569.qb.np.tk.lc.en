you need to make a bold move .
you put your underwear in my pocket .
i was , you know , flirting .
so what , you &apos;re just like a tease , is that it ?
no , i ...
thanks for wasting my time .
i see you &apos;ve met hurricane dani .
you have a girlfriend ?
she &apos;s more like a sober buddy .
i love you .
if i have to wait a while till i &apos;m gonna be with you again ...
well , then that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
i never realized until today that for us to be together ,
you have to give up everything .
if you want to make some fast bank ? why don &apos;t we sell some ids ?
isn &apos;t that like a felony ?
your mom &apos;s a school veep . you have access to her keys .
we have access to the idea maker at anchor beach .
ugh ! i hate being late to school .
then stop hogging the bathroom .
callie took longer than me .
yeah , that happened .
and in other news ,
the laws of space and time no longer apply in the bathroom .
i don &apos;t care who &apos;s to blame .
from now on , the car leaves at 7 : 30 .
whoever &apos;s not in it can walk to school .
i &apos;m always ready .
i know , honey , that &apos;s why you &apos;re my favorite .
hey !
go !
um , so i was wondering
would i be able to go to daphne &apos;s after school ?
michelle at girls united is taking kiara
and said she could pick me up and bring me home .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re that comfortable having you
go to someone &apos;s apartment unsupervised .
what if they come to our house ?
ok .
i can see if they can come to me then .
just one more day until weigh @-@ in , foster .
do you have what it takes ?
can you resist pastry perfection ?
you &apos;re gonna have to try a different trick .
or some better food .
i mean , scones , really ?
yeah , really .
and it &apos;s a family recipe , have some respect .
eat away . ice runs through these veins .
ok , ice man . hmm ? hmm ?
what are you ...
really ? really !
yep , yep .
you have a girlfriend , you know ?
thank you , captain obvious . emma &apos;s just a friend .
that better be all she is .
thank you , again , so much
for letting callie come back to anchor beach .
i know the last thing you need is more paperwork .
well , actually , i wanted to talk to you about that .
i need to fill out a progress report for callie &apos;s p.o.
she has been here every single day .
he &apos;s looking for more than just attendance ,
and to be honest , i am , too . she needs to participate .
a club , sports , student government , anything .
callie needs to show that
she wants to be a part of this community .
i understand that , and we have spoken to her
about getting more involved in school .
but not every kid is a joiner .
and not every kid is a runaway , either .
look , i know you and stef have your hands full with five teenagers .
we are managing .
mariana and jesus have both been suspended this year ,
and jude barely passed his proficiency test .
brandon is the only one ...
that what , isn &apos;t a normal teenager ?
everyone &apos;s kids make mistakes , karina .
are mine supposed to be held to a higher standard
because i work here ?
lena , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
what are you saying ?
i want callie to succeed here .
i really do .
and the more roots that she puts down ,
the harder they are to pull up ,
and the easier my paperwork gets .
oh . i forgot about the fire drill .
i know the school &apos;s not really on fire ,
but the drill doesn &apos;t work unless we pretend .
of course , vice principal . going .
第一季 第十七集
hey . did you get in ? did it work ?
we got a problem . oh , hell . we got two problems .
a cop . be cool .
hey , b , how are you ?
hey , mom .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m having lunch with mama .
uh ... this is vico .
how are you ?
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
uh ... class .
new friend ?
nah , not really .
how are you ? i miss you .
i &apos;m good .
come to have dinner with us tomorrow at the house ?
i can &apos;t , actually .
come on , why not ?
i have a &quot; getting to know you &quot; thing with dad and his girlfriend , so
your dad has a girlfriend ?
that &apos;s nice . how long has that been going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
it must be serious if he &apos;s asking you to meet her , right ?
well , we met before . we just haven &apos;t ...
oh , i see . she &apos;s been by the apartment .
is she spending the night there ?
mom , i don &apos;t ...
no , no , b , listen .
you know , you &apos;re living with your dad ,
and i just want to make sure that it &apos;s a healthy environment .
i &apos;m not gonna get in the middle of this .
ok .
so if you wanna know about dad &apos;s girlfriend , ask him .
will do .
ok .
how old is she ?
mom .
what , is she 30 ? at least ?
come on . love you .
i love you .
you know , it just ...
it &apos;s hard enough with brandon not living under our roof .
his father has got girls going in and out ,
and coming and going .
one girl . one girl .
remember the pet psychic ?
oh , god . she was young .
yeah , she said that our cat used to be cleopatra in a former life .
remember that ?
i forgot about that .
mmm , here &apos;s one .
&quot; african @-@ american , six foot ,
masters in poetry . loves dogs . &quot;
you know , if she &apos;s gonna be spending the night at the apartment ,
exactly what kind of an example is that setting for brandon ?
we should definitely meet her .
african @-@ american ?
yeah ...
no , i just ...
you know , if we &apos;re ... can &apos;t have the baby together ,
just that maybe i thought we could find a donor
that has more of my characteristics .
you mean white ?
and smart and loyal and charming
and sweet and loving and caring .
see , the thing is that i &apos;m half white
so if we go with a donor who &apos;s also white ,
then the baby might not end up looking like me at all .
but it has to look like ...
no , no , no , i get it . i get it .
it &apos;s just , you know , it &apos;s going to be our baby .
and that &apos;s fine . that &apos;s all that matters .
it doesn &apos;t have to look like me .
so african @-@ american it is . totally .
let &apos;s do this .
hey , friend .
hey ,
pal .
so do we ...
... should we eat lunch together ?
i don &apos;t know .
that kind of seems like advanced @-@ level friendship .
well , it was a good effort .
yeah , baby steps .
i can &apos;t believe kelsey got the friends in our break @-@ up .
it &apos;s &apos; cause they &apos;re scared of her , right ?
yeah . i don &apos;t blame them . she &apos;s scary .
meanwhile , zac &apos;s acting like
i set his lighting plans on fire or something ,
which is lame . he &apos;s the one who left me at the cast party .
yeah , he left because he thought you two were on a date .
no , we &apos;re just ... you came with us .
yeah , he wasn &apos;t too happy about that .
oh , no .
what ?
zac was there , when chase went upstairs , after i ...
after i put my underwear in chase &apos;s pocket .
wait ! you did what ?
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
look , and the whole time , i was on a date ,
with zac .
yeah . a pretty bad one .
hey . what happened ? did you get caught ?
no , there was an alarm .
it wasn &apos;t on today , but it will be after hours .
so we &apos;re screwed ?
unless you can get the code .
sure . i &apos;ll ask my mom .
she &apos;s gotta have it written down somewhere , right ?
it &apos;s worth it , dude .
the machine works like a charm .
出生日期 1991年11月29日 有效期至 11 / 29 / 2015
ok . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
you got huevos , foster .
with a cop and a vice principal for a mom .
it &apos;s only a one @-@ time thing .
once i get the money i need , i &apos;m out .
totally . but first things first .
we &apos;re putting that bad boy to the test .
we &apos;re hitting the bars tonight .
zac .
i have a newspaper meeting , like now , so ...
i &apos;m sorry ,
for the misunderstanding at the cast party .
i didn &apos;t know that you thought we were together together .
i didn &apos;t think that .
you didn &apos;t ?
no .
we worked on the play together ,
we went to the party as friends .
good . ok . so we &apos;re ok ?
no .
you don &apos;t ditch a friend to go hook @-@ up with some no @-@ talent toolbox .
ok , i did not hook up with chase .
whatever , mariana ,
don &apos;t worry about it . the play &apos;s over .
we don &apos;t need to be friends .
you told people ?
what are you talking about ?
the pant ... the panties .
what ? no .
is this because i didn &apos;t hook up with you ?
look , it wasn &apos;t me . you must have told someone .
or somebody saw you . you weren &apos;t exactly stealth about it .
no , you &apos;re lying .
you know how i know you &apos;re lying ?
because you &apos;re a terrible actor .
hey ! come in .
what &apos;s up ?
dang ! look at you .
she cleans up good , doesn &apos;t she ?
my p.o. makes me wear this for interviews .
feel like i &apos;m in a halloween costume .
so how &apos;d it go ?
we &apos;ll see .
well , thanks for coming to me .
i can only be here or at school , so ...
it &apos;s kind of like i never left girls united .
ain &apos;t nothing about this place like girls united .
you ran away from here ?
um , you guys want some food ?
i can , like , make us sandwiches or something .
just glad i &apos;m not eating ramen .
so how is independent living ?
it &apos;s a challenge . they don &apos;t pay enough to cover my bills .
no one &apos;s trying to hire a kid out of juvie ,
no matter how many recommendation letters rita or michelle write .
and they won &apos;t give you tasha back without a job ?
i get a supervised visit with her next week .
yeah . i want to buy her this tricycle ,
like the one i had when i was kid .
so she won &apos;t forget me while i &apos;m trying to get her back .
that &apos;s why i need a job .
so what &apos;s up with you ?
um , you know .
no , we don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s all good . i &apos;m supposed to be making friends
and joining clubs , i guess .
i don &apos;t really have anything in common
with the kids i go to school with , so ...
you didn &apos;t have much in common with us , either ,
but we &apos;re all friends .
and brandon ?
not an issue .
he moved in with his dad .
not an issue ?
he &apos;s everywhere you look , and you &apos;re in school with him .
yeah , no , brandon and me , we &apos;re good .
well , kiara has some good news .
i got me a foster family .
what ?
yeah .
all because of you .
that picture you took of me in photography class ,
they used it on the website .
um , it &apos;s just a picture .
no , your pictures are different .
they &apos;re more real .
your picture brought out all of my inner beauty .
the pictures cps takes of us
makes us all look like dogs at the pound .
well , hello , ladies .
hi , mrs. foster .
hi .
go ahead and call me stef , all right ?
glad that you guys could come and visit . that &apos;s wonderful .
you want anything else ?
no , thanks .
well , if you change your mind , just help yourself , right ?
michelle &apos;s gonna pick us up at any moment .
so we should probably wait for her . thanks .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna walk you out so i can say hi to michelle .
thanks , mrs ... stef .
you &apos;re welcome . bye .
what &apos;d i tell you , man ? these things are golden .
fine , we got past the doors ,
but what if someone else figures us out ?
we could get arrested .
no one is getting arrested .
i &apos;ll have a rusty nail .
yeah , i &apos;ll have a cosmopolitan ?
well or shelf ?
what do you recommend ?
top shelf .
you know what is gonna get us busted ?
you standing there looking all uptight and guilty .
hell , i &apos;m about to arrest you .
our ids kick ass . enjoy this moment .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
good .
so why did you need the money so fast ?
long story .
bars were invented for long stories .
nice . it &apos;s like drinking with my little sister .
$ 12 ?
top shelf , bro .
so i meant to tell you about the conversation i had with karina today
about how we have our hands full with all these kids .
yeah , well , we do .
her tone was more critical than concerned .
they have been getting into some trouble .
what else did she have to say ?
she has to do callie &apos;s progress reports for her p.o.
and she really thinks that callie should be
getting more engaged in school .
ok , should we be concerned that
she &apos;s spending so much time with daphne and kiara ?
why , &apos; cause they &apos;re juvenile delinquents ?
well , because she &apos;s not making friends at anchor beach ,
but now that you mention it .
they &apos;re good girls .
yeah , at heart , but they do have a history of drugs and gangs .
the rate of recidivism with girls like them ...
callie is a girl like them .
need some help ?
i think we &apos;re good , thanks .
um , i took a picture of kiara while i was at girls united
and i guess it helped her find a foster family .
that &apos;s wonderful .
yeah , so i was thinking
maybe i could do that for other kids that need foster homes .
take pictures , i mean .
so i can talk to my p.o. ,
and see if it would count towards my community service hours .
and maybe i could use the photo lab at school ?
great . i think that can be arranged .
yeah , maybe you can ask some of your classmates for some help ,
or make some new friends .
i was actually gonna have daphne and kiara help me out ,
just for their hours , too .
ok , that makes sense , but principal sanchez would really
like to see you getting more involved in school .
yeah , and we would , too .
i will try .
well , she wants to do it at school .
that &apos;s a step in the right direction , right ?
yeah .
all right , let me guess .
huge gambling debt . and if you don &apos;t get the money asap ,
a bookie &apos;s gonna come break your legs .
or you &apos;re a male prostitute on the run from your pimp .
you caught me .
no , i owe it to my dad , actually .
he was giving it to me for my piano lessons , and i quit going .
so you just pocketed it ?
well , i was saving it for callie .
so you &apos;re willing to break bad for the girl .
you must be in love .
you know what ? forget i told you .
so what , she took the money and ran off with wyatt ?
no .
i used it for something else .
and now i have to pay my dad back before he finds out .
he &apos;s just been going through a lot of stuff lately ,
and i just don &apos;t want to stress him out anymore .
you &apos;re a good man , charlie brown .
you &apos;re an ass .
is that any way to talk to your wingman ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting you laid , bro .
best thing for a broken heart . let &apos;s go .
i gotta go .
don &apos;t be a wuss .
no , i gotta go .
i missed breakfast ?
you had to work .
all right , when i go back to my regular schedule ,
it &apos;s me , you and pancakes every morning ,
just like mom &apos;s .
or you know , cereal . but together .
uh , so you know that dinner with dani tonight ?
it &apos;s been moved .
yeah , to mom &apos;s house .
apparently , someone told her i had a girlfriend .
right , i &apos;m sorry .
so , um ...
... how long has dani been sober ?
five years . why ?
are you ...
i mean ,
do you worry about dating another alcoholic ?
i mean , like , if she were to start drinking again ,
would that maybe make you wanna ...
brandon , i appreciate the concern .
but she &apos;s a rock , ok ?
look , i know i &apos;ve given you reason to worry in the past ,
but my sobriety is not tied into anyone else &apos;s .
ok ?
ok .
i &apos;m in a good place .
all right .
oh , i called your piano teacher .
when ?
last week .
and when he calls me back , i &apos;m gonna tell him to save you a spot .
the spot &apos;s long gone . he has a waiting list .
so i sweet @-@ talked him once , who &apos;s to say i can &apos;t do it again ?
i just don &apos;t want to take from him , ok ?
i &apos;m still playing piano , so ...
he was kind of a pompous ass anyway .
so just don &apos;t call him .
again .
are you sure ?
yeah .
ok .
all right .
how is it possible you got scrawnier , foster ?
you get dumber every day , so ...
torched !
jesus , you &apos;re up .
oh , down a class .
looks like someone &apos;s getting himself off the bench .
never doubted it for a moment .
thanks for your support .
emma , you &apos;re up .
whoa , would you look at that ? i take it back , foster .
emma gained . now you &apos;re in the same class .
looks like we &apos;re gonna have a wrestle @-@ off this afternoon .
torched !
vico , step up to the plate .
i was just on my way to see you with a gift .
actually , more of a bribe , truth be told .
ok , what exactly are you hoping to get in exchange
for this delectable baked good ?
i was wondering if it &apos;s possible that i take some of the props
from the drama club this weekend to the nursing home with me .
the nursing home ? are you moving in ?
no .
i direct the residents in productions of shakespeare .
this weekend &apos;s our performance .
well , of course . take whatever you need .
how did i not know this ,
that you &apos;re doing shakespeare in a nursing home ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve been doing it a long time ,
so i never thought to mention it , i guess .
that &apos;s amazing , timothy .
i &apos;m very impressed .
well , you needn &apos;t be , but thank you .
and the sunshine valley home for the aged production of coriolanus
thanks you as well .
she didn &apos;t &quot; like &quot; my pic , so i was all ,
&quot; wish yourself a happy birthday . &quot;
ugh , just unfollow her already .
i know , but then it &apos;s weird
&apos;cause it &apos;s like when does she notice , and when she does ,
does she think it &apos;s an accident ?
hi .
hey .
hey . i &apos;m callie .
we know . we &apos;re friends with talya .
this place is so high school .
i know . i feel like everybody &apos;s talking about me .
who cares ?
everyone thinks that i stole brandon from talya .
well , you kind of did steal brandon from talya .
right , and you kind of did put your underwear in chase &apos;s pocket .
anyway , i know it &apos;s embarrassing ,
but in the scheme of things to worry about ,
what these people think of you , it &apos;s not one of them .
you &apos;re right .
what &apos;s going on here ?
mariana , will you please open your eyes ?
no . because if i do ,
then i have to acknowledge that this is actually happening .
look , honey , we just want to talk to you about ...
... the right ways to let a boy that you like him .
oh , my god , please don &apos;t do this .
sorry , but this is important , mariana .
all right ? we don &apos;t want anyone to get the wrong impression .
you don &apos;t ... that &apos;s what it was , the wrong impression ?
yes , nothing happened .
ok .
mariana , where did you even get such a crazy idea ?
talya . she used it on ... never mind .
yes , please , stop there .
look , i just ...
... no one would believe that a boy like chase would like me .
i just ... i wanted to prove them wrong .
mariana .
honey ,
trust me one day soon , much too soon for us ,
the right boy is gonna want to be with you .
yeah , that &apos;s what everybody old says .
yes , and you should listen to them because they are wise ,
and by the way , not that old .
beat it .
whatever happened to do you like me , circle yes or no ?
by the way , i invited brandon and mike over for dinner tonight .
what ? you did ?
yeah , and mike &apos;s new girlfriend . i told you this yesterday .
no , honey , just because you think something ,
doesn &apos;t mean you ever said it out loud .
ok , then i &apos;m telling you now .
i &apos;ve invited brandon and mike
and mike &apos;s new girlfriend over for dinner .
you said that we should met her .
i agree .
i think that &apos;s great , but i invited timothy over for dinner .
timothy ? well , then you can reschedule .
come on .
why should i reschedule ?
because we know that timothy is not going to turn out
to be a 20 @-@ year @-@ old hussy
who might someday be our son &apos;s stepmother .
it &apos;s too late . it &apos;d be rude .
well , fine . then we &apos;re having a dinner party . whoo !
let &apos;s break out the hummus .
graffiti is a crime , you know ?
ha @-@ ha . no , it &apos;s , um ...
this is you taking the photos ?
that &apos;s pretty awesome .
yeah , um ...
michelle is bringing some of kids from girls united .
she &apos;s put the word out to other homes , as well , so hopefully ,
it &apos;ll be a good turnout .
i wanna help them .
and i have to for community service , so ...
they &apos;re just letting you use the school ?
yeah .
lena &apos;s gonna come and get me and lock up after .
cool . you &apos;re a really good person .
two men enter , one man leaves !
two men enter , one man leaves !
two men enter , one man leaves ! whoo !
shake hands .
guess you shouldn &apos;t have eaten all those scones .
congrats , emma .
hey , foster , the bench isn &apos;t gonna warm itself .
nice move . you deserve it .
why are you mad ? you won .
it &apos;s how i won . you saw me as a girl .
you think i let you win because you &apos;re a girl ?
no , i think i won because it got weird .
it wasn &apos;t just me .
i have busted my ass , worked a hundred times harder
than any of you guys to be on this team .
i know you have .
on that mat , i &apos;m not a girl .
fine , you &apos;re not a girl .
god , you made me mad .
damn , y &apos;all . this school is fancy .
right ? yeah , it &apos;s way nicer than the ones
jude and i grew up going to .
hey , how &apos;s daphne doing ?
it &apos;s rough . i &apos;m worried about her .
yeah , me , too . does rita know ?
they check in on her , but you see that brave face she puts on
like she don &apos;t need no help .
she &apos;s gonna go back to the gang
if she doesn &apos;t get tasha back .
i hear you .
you think she &apos;s gonna show ?
i hope so .
hi . i was going to bring dessert
but i &apos;m a terrible cook , so ...
i doubt you &apos;re terrible at anything .
but thank you so much . it was so , so kind of you .
stef , this is my brilliant coworker timothy .
yes , we &apos;ve met before , honey .
hi , stef .
hi , how are you ?
good too see you .
thank you .
hi , come on in . you must be dani .
you must be stef . thanks so much for having us over .
i &apos;ve heard so much about all of you .
i wish we could say the same ...
you promised .
well , why don &apos;t out of the doorway , shall we ? dinner &apos;s ready .
yes , come on . come sit down .
mike and dani , why don &apos;t you come sit over here next to me ?
don &apos;t you wanna sit next to your wife ?
i eat dinner with her every night .
no , actually , stef , i thought you could sit over here
next to timothy .
uh ... i thought brandon could sit there .
no , no , brandon could just sit right here .
why don &apos;t i just move down one , and then brandon could ...
no , you &apos;re a guest , you can sit wherever you like . stef , just ...
right here . right there .
演唱者 hey ocean !

yeah , whatever .

his parents won &apos;t take him back .
so he &apos;s looking for a foster home .

you know how many buses i had to take to get here ?
you put your cornrows back in .
yeah .
so did you hear about the job ?

you &apos;ll get the next one .
i didn &apos;t know they had schools on the beach .
this is like one of them resorts in mexico .
what , they give you a penny colada with your homework ?
come on , let &apos;s get started .
yes , i love that .
ok , and just , um , look over here . yeah .

out . go !
this looks amazing .
thank you .
hey , bud . where you been ?
sorry , studying . lost track of time .
no doubt grappling with
the motifs of guilt and deception in hamlet .
timothy was a rhodes scholar .
well , that &apos;s impressive .
it &apos;s really not a big deal .
no , it &apos;s a huge deal .
it recognizes academic achievement and character
and leadership ability .
or in my case ,
an ability to write an essay that swindled
a committee to believe i had all that .
none for me , thanks .
i &apos;m sober .
oh , you &apos;re in the program , too ?
five years . that &apos;s actually how i met mike .
they &apos;re sober buddies .
are sober buddies allowed to date each other ?
yes , if they &apos;re consenting adults .
you know , bill clinton was a rhodes scholar , as well ,
i believe , wasn &apos;t he ?
uh , yeah .
so what do you do , dani ?
i &apos;m a dog walker .
a business owner actually .
she has five employees and what , over 100 clients ?
timothy is an animal lover .
big time .
maybe i should date timothy .
what is going on in there ?
i &apos;m trying to figure out
if that woman is a good influence on our son
and all you &apos;re talking about is timothy .
all right . i have been thinking
maybe we shouldn &apos;t go with an anonymous sperm donor .
maybe we should ask timothy .
ok , maybe you should ask me first .
i wanted you to get to know timothy better without the pressure
of , you know , thinking of him like that .
well , if you had talked to me first ,
then maybe i could have saved you the trip
to awesometimothyfacts.com ,
because i &apos;m not comfortable with
you seeing our child &apos;s father every day at work .
like you and mike ?
come on , that &apos;s different .
lena , the ...
think about how challenging everything has been so far .
do you really wanna open the door to
someone else &apos;s involvement in our lives ?
the baby &apos;s life ?
if it means knowing our child &apos;s history ,
yeah , maybe .
hi . just checking . can i help with anything ?
excuse me . i &apos;m gonna hit the head .
so , i understand
you &apos;re a little concerned about my sobriety .
no , i ...
look , you &apos;re worried about your dad .
if i fall off the wagon , he &apos;ll fall off the wagon .
which leads me to believe someone saw me out last night .
i know i saw you .
it was a one @-@ time thing .
i understand . it was for me , too .
i slipped up . it won &apos;t ever happen again .
are you going to tell him ?
your dad has had a rough time lately .
he doesn &apos;t need any bad news .
so i don &apos;t see any reason
to tell him about any of this .
right ?
hi , thanks for dinner last night .
i am so sorry about that . oh , my god .
about what ? saying amazing things about me ?
no apology necessary .
i just really wanted stef to know how much i respect you
and how much i cherish our friendship .
well , thank you .
and if you &apos;re interested in using me as ...
... you know ...
... a sperm donor ...
i &apos;m in . if you want .
excuse me . i need to speak with you .
&quot; in his role as the gentleman caller , chase dillon
has all the charm and skill of a hat rack .
though perhaps that is an insult to hat racks ,
which at the very least , have purpose .
his performance is an insult
to the entire concept of live theater itself .
also he abuses kittens . &quot;
wow . honestly , that was much nicer than i would have been .
how did you do this ?
doesn &apos;t the paper have to be approved by , like , a teacher ?
well , i might do the paper &apos;s layout ,
and i might have made a tweak or two
after our faculty advisor gave final approval .
what chase did to you was a total douche move .
there &apos;s no way i was gonna let him get away with it .
why ? &apos; cause i &apos;m your friend ?
no , because i was righting a wrong .
sorry , don &apos;t believe you .
i &apos;m like batman .
we &apos;re totally friends .
all right , fine , we &apos;re friends ,
quit rubbing it in .
someone got into the administrative office last night ,
and a number of kindle paperwhite e @-@ readers are now missing .
do you know anything about that ?
well , it wasn &apos;t ...
we know it wasn &apos;t you , honey .
during your photo shoot ,
you didn &apos;t give my keys to anyone , did you ?
no .
i gave you the keys to go to the bathroom .
i know your life &apos;s not easy right now .
so it &apos;s gotta be me , right ? something goes missing ,
it &apos;s gotta be the poor girl with the cornrows ?
that &apos;s not fair .
you called me out here ,
made me take three buses across town ,
just so you can accuse me of stealing ?
they &apos;re making me give them a list of everyone who was there .
i didn &apos;t take nothing .
but fyi , you know who you can put on that list ?
your boy brandon .
no , he wasn &apos;t there .
he was he was at my house having dinner .
well , i saw him lurking around in the halls .
so unless he can be in two places at once ...
why didn &apos;t you tell me last night if he was there ?
he &apos;s your temptation .
and we &apos;re supposed to have each other &apos;s back , remember ?
you didn &apos;t come by school
during the photo shoot last night , did you ,
to say hi or something ?
no , i was at the house having dinner .
why ?
it &apos;s stupid , um ,
daphne said she saw you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
some stuff was stolen from the office .
pretty sure daphne did it .
i gotta go .
ok .
um ... two things .
first , i know how hard you &apos;ve worked to be on this team .
so if i offended you yesterday , i apologize .
ok , accepted .
what &apos;s the second thing ?
what about lexi ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s in honduras .
who knows when i &apos;ll see her again ?
right .
but i don &apos;t do cheating .
i know . me neither .
i think i have to break up with her .
your cut .
when you were in the office last night making the ids ,
did you steal some stuff , too ?
so what ?
moron .
now they know someone was in there .
but they don &apos;t know it was us , do they ?
no .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
someone &apos;s gonna go down for this !
that &apos;s a good thing .
ok , whatever you took , put it back .
ok , this was not part of the deal .
all right , nancy , relax .
i can &apos;t just walk in and hand it to them
just put it back or they &apos;ll find it .
anonymously . and don &apos;t take anything else .
no ... i &apos;ll come back .
no , that &apos;s fine . what &apos;s up ?
so last night , um ...
... i just remembered
i gave daphne the keys .
thank you for telling us .
independent living is
a lot harder than she thought it was gonna be so ...
what do you think ?
i like the ones where they &apos;re not looking at the camera .
yeah , me , too .
i wanna see those .
no , no , no ... wait .
what are you doing ?
i have to zoom in .
what &apos;s that ?
let me brighten it .
it &apos;s brandon &apos;s car .
he was there last night .
