Target Rich
This guy stumbles in to the Atlantic City E.R.
having been shot in the jaw.
They were able to get a name, Giuseppe Montolo...
He's a contract killer.
Only a hitman would be this good.
You're under arrest.
He's playing us.
The only leverage he has
is a list of potential victims targeted by a network of hitmen.
I know there's more of you out there,
but me and my team will not rest
until we take every last one of you sons of bitches down.
The dirty dozen.
This is who you're gonna kill next.
Your lawyer told me you're ready to talk.
Can you talk?
I can talk.
Any deal we make is contingent on actionable intelligence.
That means we make an arrest
before we make you comfortable.
Capisce?
You're part of an interconnected group of hitmen
working together online--yes or no?
Si.
How many of them are you?
Besides me, cuatro.
I need names and contact information.
The last time we talked,
You hinted that this was your next target--
The dirty dozen. Who are they?
That's the wrong question.
It's not a who...
it's a what.
What does that mean exactly?
Look, cut the act! I ain't in the mood to play with you.
What does it mean?!
Don't choke!
Hey! I need medical!
‭Don't choke!
Get me medical!
Hi! Yay! Bellissimo!
Ohh! Welcome back!
Welcome back.
I missed you guys.
Oh, we missed you more.
Oh, wow--oh, my gosh, nice. Will's favorite brand.
Thank you, Rossi.
And, Spence, wow.
It's my original set.
And I realize that most of this information
is most likely on that "Internet,"
but you can never teach old-fashioned research habits too soon.
How's the little guy doing?
Oh, he's good.
He's sleeping through the night for now, at least.
Oh, and, Spence, I showed him the picture of when you first visited
and he started kicking his little legs
and he smiled real big.
Who wouldn't get excited seeing that bella faccia?
I think he wants to see you.
You know, studies have shown
that babies begin exhibiting cognizable nonverbal communication
within days of birth.
And some things never change.
Yeah. And some things do,
And because of that, we took the liberty of doing...
this.
It's all the pictures you sent while you were away.
You guys, I love it.
It's--it's perfect.
Thank you, all of you.
Almost all of you.
They're debriefing.
The warden determined that Montolo had been poisoned
by one of the guards.
Did they make an arrest?
No. The guard was found shot execution style in his car.
Hotch, Montolo was our only viable lead.
When I asked him who the dirty dozen were,
he said it's not who, it's what.
So maybe it's not a list of human targets like we thought.
It could just be something in the hitmen's infrastructure.
Well, it doesn't change our investigation.
I'll have Garcia search the darknet with new parameters.
Yeah.
Well, for the next 5 minutes, anyway,
I just want to enjoy the fact that our friend is back.
Ok, and this is your bureau approved bubbly.
Cheers. Ok, now tell me all about Tara Lewis.
She is really excited to meet you.
I think here exact words after reading your reports were,
"Is JJ as awesome as I think she is?"
I like her already.
Ok, you did not just have a baby.
Hey, you.
‭Welcome back.
Seriously, talk to me. What is your secret?
'cause you look good.
Well, yeah, see these guns?
It's from lugging around two boys all day.
Oh, baby weightlifting. I would buy that DVD.
Excuse me.
SSA Rossi.
Cider.
Hey, dad, it's me.
Joy?
Yeah. Uh, this is my work cell.
Sorry you didn't recognize the number.
Well, everything ok?
Are you still at that conference in New York?
Uh, no, actually.
We need to talk.
Are you at your office?
Yeah.
Great. So am I.
Ok, so it started as a long form piece
that I'm writing for "Esquire" on campus violence against women.
After the whole UVA debacle,
my editor told me I needed to triple source everything,
and that's when I came across this pattern.
Missing freshmen and sophomores, all women.
4 over 9 years.
They were taken from different east coast campuses.
By the time their families realize that they're missing,
the trail is cold.
So I put out an alert on campus chat rooms,
and this morning I got a call about her.
Bahni Desai.
Her sister said she went missing last night
from Judy Temple College.
What do the campus police think?
It hasn't been 24 hours, so there's nothing they can do.
Look, it might be a coincidence.
But I have cried with 4 families,
and I don't want hers to be number 5.
Give me a second.
We haven't been invited in.
No.
And the missing student might be fine.
She might.
I know I'm asking a lot,
but Joy is my daughter.
Look, all I'm saying is that we talk to campus police,
friends, rule out any foul play.
And we could get answers a lot faster than Joy could.
Exactly.
So, what do you say?
"We are all sharks, circling,
and waiting, for traces of blood to appear in the water."
Alan Clark.
4 cases in 9 years. How come this hasn't been on our radar?
Because the disappearances
were in different states with different M.O.S.
The first missing woman was Kathy Miller from NYU in 2006.
So what's the plan once we land on campus?
Track Bahni's movements. Campus police checked her room.
She's not there. They taped it off for you.
What about her cell phone?
It just pinged in her room overnight.
Strange for millennials to go anywhere without a phone.
No credit card activity.
I confirmed with all ticket agencies
she didn't take a boat, bus, blimp, or plane last night.
Oh! Dean's office just sent us her file from Judy Temple College.
It looks like... Oh, dear.
Looks like what?
She voluntarily withdrew.
Dad, this is Bahni's sister Aasia.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for helping.
We were supposed to meet in D.C. this morning.
After two hours of Bahni's mobile going to voicemail,
I called the campus police.
The phone is in the room, but she isn't.
There's something else we need to talk about.
Did she tell you she was withdrawing from school?
She was?
She got a B-plus on her midterm.
She thought her world was over.
Aasia, you never told me that.
She picked up extra-credit work
and she was going to withdraw her request on Monday.
This, whatever's happening,
it isn't related to that.
I need you to believe me.
I do.
Excuse me.
I have to say something.
You're not gonna like hearing it.
Sometimes emotion can cloud our judgment in an investigation.
We see smoke, but there's no fire.
So, you don't think this is related to the other cases?
I'm not saying that,
yet. You and I are going to take this as far as it will go.
She definitely didn't plan on leaving town.
Her clothes, shoes, and luggage are all still here.
Well, it looks like she was trying on different outfits.
Mini skirts, heels. She was clearly going out.
But why not take her phone?
She'd need it to meet up with her friends?
Unless her friends were already here.
Reid, same textbooks, different names.
She wasn't studying alone.
Might be the last person who saw her.
Paddy Morris, this is the FBI.
Very funny, Josh.
It's too early for this...
You're not Josh.
Another left and another right!
4 times...
Tommy?
Is that you?
No!
Get in.
No!
Shut up! Shh!
You shut up!
I was with her last night. She was fine.
Any idea why she left her cell phone in her room?
We didn't take purses, and we didn't have pockets in our skirts.
Ok, walk us through the night.
You guys were studying before you went out?
Yeah. Um...
I knew about this party.
She didn't want to go.
He said he's definitely gonna be here.
Do I look ok?
You look perfect.
We can only stay for an hour.
I'm meeting my sister super early.
Ok, fine. Stop stressing.
Show off your assets, please.
This is the first time I've seen you dressing for fun.
Ok! That's enough.
Get ready to have your mind blown,
because this party is going to be epic.
This guy was in class today asking
why his Python encode wouldn't work. I'm like--
Girls are here.
So it wasn't epic.
It was most decidedly not...
Epic.
Did you two come back to the dorm?
No. I made her stay.
Why?
There was this tennis guy
that I'd been trading tweets with.
He said he'd show up, but he was late,
and then the later it got, the more I drank.
No...
How much did you have?
Her, I don't know, me, a lot. Until...
Let's get this party start--
Peter!
Honey. How's it going? I...
Paddy.
Paddy, hi. Right.
I'm going now.
What?
I'm going.
Sure.
Did anyone walk out after her,
maybe try to escort her?
Not that I saw.
God, it's my fault, isn't it?
No, it's not.
But there's still a way you can help us.
Anything. Name it.
Where was the party?
Ok, mapping the route from
the not-so-awesome house party to Bahni's dorm.
What are those icons there along the street?
Security cameras.
They line the perimeter of the campus.
And to answer your
next question, that is real good news for us
because it means that we can pull the feed from last night
and presto.
Start at 1 A.M. and go forward.
Roger.
Got her.
Looks like she's stumbling a little.
Drunk, alone at night.
She's a low-risk vic a high-risk environment.
Wait, wait. Right there.
Stop.
All right, back it up.
Yeah. Can you enhance that?
Oh, my God.
Garcia, what's the next camera they show up on?
None of them.
Joy, you were right to come to us.
We'll open a case and coordinate
with campus and Alexandria P.D.
I'll make sure this is their top priority.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
I went to Darfur on assignment.
Did I ever tell you that?
No.
It was just after I was married,
before Kai was born.
I saw the worst a human being can do to another.
But this is still so...
The first disappearance you uncovered,
Kathy Miller, NYU, 2006.
You went to NYU in 2006.
That's why you started this investigation.
Tell me about Kathy.
I didn't know her, really.
We just had one class together.
Even though there was never a body,
her parents had a memorial.
And I went 'cause she was so young.
And it could have been me.
So what do you think the chances are of finding Bahni?
Better because it was reported right away.
I want to tell you we'll find her,
but realistically I can't. But we have a picture now.
We'll build a profile. We'll go to the press.
Bahni has a shot
that she wouldn't have without you.
And here he comes, surging down the stretch to home,
just in time, going full out.
What are you doin' up there?!
If you scream, I'll kill you.
Look...
I don't want to hurt you, ok?
I'm hungry!
Get your ass down here!
Get me some food!
Do you hear me?
Ok!
This is your room now.
I'm keeping you.
This is the last spot she was seen.
The next camera is 100 feet down,
Which makes this the abduction zone.
Well, Alexandria police searched the buildings. Nothing there.
Well, if she got in the car with him,
they would have shown up on the camera down the street.
But shoving her in the trunk of a car
out in the open like this, it's too risky.
That leaves this.
Everything ok?
Actually, no. My mom's not doing so well.
The doctors have had to change her medicine 3 times
to try to stabilize the schizophrenia.
Spence, why didn't you say anything?
I don't want to bother you.
Ok.
That's never possible.
Got it? How long has this been going on?
It's gotten really bad the past few weeks.
Look, the minute we are done here,
you need to go help her. She needs you.
I know. Right now so does Bahni.
All right, let's think this through.
All right, if he took her out this way, it's a busier street.
The traffic was lighter last night,
but it's still a risk to abduct someone in plain sight.
So he was able to control
a drunk woman and it didn't look suspicious.
He probably just put his arm around her and walked off.
She was too drunk to even realize she was in danger.
You know, if this was just about the assault,
he could have done that back in the alley.
I think this has gotta be some sort of long-term play.
Then he's been watching Bahni,
looking for the perfect opportunity.
Well, he certainly found it last night.
She's a straight "A" student who never drinks
and rarely goes out.
Ok, so if he watched and waited to take Bahni,
we should be looking for offenders with precursor crimes
of stalking and peeping.
Greater metro area creeps coming up.
He's patient and organized.
He'll have a plan for
when she sobers up and becomes noncompliant.
He'll isolate her so it's easier to be dependent on him.
She's the most important thing in the world to him right now.
We need to get him to see her as a person.
The FBI is working to locate this woman,
19-year-old sophomore Bahni Desai.
She went missing last night from Judy Temple College.
We're also trying to identify this man.
We believe he has information
that will help us locate Bahni.
Isn't this man also a suspect?
Right now he's a person of interest,
strictly a witness.
Did he abduct her? Why isn't he being considered a threat?
Our focus right now is on Bahni,
which is why her sister Aasia
would like to say a few words.
All my parents want,
all I want,
is to see Bahni again soon.
Please, call the hotline number if you can help.
When she arrived at school...
that girl's probably chopped up
under the floorboards somewhere.
She always knows how to make everyone around her smile,
especially children.
What--jeez, you can't do anything right, you stupid bastard.
And you're a worse cook than your mother.
Why don't you just take this slop
and clean it up, you son of a bitch.
You get back here and clean this up, you hear me?!
Bahni, if you can hear me, we love you very much,
and we'll never stop searching for you
until we have you back in our arms.
That was an FBI announcement regarding the abduction
of 19-year-old Bahni Desai. We'll be coming back with...
Anything from the hotline calls?
Nothing legit. But there's a walk-in
that security thinks you should talk to.
Can I help you?
I'm the man in the video.
I saw the press conference.
You wanted to talk to me?
This is Agent Jareau, Mr. Burnett. She'll be joining us.
Call me Sam.
Is that your birthstone?
Uh, it's my son's.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
So, uh, Mr. Burnett, can you just--
just walk us through why you were on Front Street at 1 a.m.
I drive a cab. I'm Medallion 3469.
And moonlight as a sober cabdriver.
It's a service local bars and campuses provide
to make sure kids get home safely if they've gotten stupid.
Front Street's a good spot to post up and wait for fares.
I was checking my phone when I saw her.
‭- Bahni.- I don't know.
I guess.
What I noticed was how out of it she was.
I went to help.
Then some dude came up and walked off with her.
It seemed like they knew one another.
Can you describe him?
Big. My height.
He was wearing a hoodie, so I couldn't see his face.
But, I mean, that's the guy you should be looking for, right?
Ok, explain something to me.
Um, why did you step back into the doorway?
What do you mean?
Well, you saw Bahni coming,
You stepped back to let her pass, then you followed her.
Listen, I came in here because you asked.
Maybe that was a mistake.
After that guy went off with that girl,
I got a fare, which I took.
My cab has GPS. You can check it out.
If you don't believe me, maybe I should get a lawyer.
His GPS and his cell phone confirm his whereabouts, sir.
And this was 5 minutes later.
Yeah. No way he'd have Bahni in the trunk when he had customers.
You let him go?
His alibi checks out.
Dad, you said Bahni had a
shot because we had a picture and a profile.
And in this case, the picture does not match the profile.
He followed her, dad.
There is something off about this guy,
but he did not take Bahni.
Did you check his priors?
No arrests at all.
Joy, I'm doing everything I can.
I know you are, dad.
I need some air.
The beauty of this one
is it covers the fruit or whatever you're slicing
so that your fingers are nowhere near the blade.
That's amazing!
And it's all uniform, all the same size.
Now, just...
Don't touch that!
Never, never touch that!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Anyone see Joy?
Not for a while. Why?
She asked about Sam's rap sheet.
At the time, I didn't think it through. But she is a journalist.
And Sam's a lead.
Pull him up, Garcia.
Ok, uh, Sam Burnett.
No record. Just his address and his date of birth.
He's about the same age as Joy.
That's it. Where did he go to college?
He dropped out of NYU in 2006.
The same time Kathy Miller went missing.
Ok, but hold up. What are we saying?
Burnett did not take Bahni.
But he could be an unsub.
When he talked about Bahni's abduction,
he wasn't concerned. He was jealous.
We have two separate unsubs
in a target rich environment.
And Joy's going to confront the one we know.
Garcia, ping her phone.
She's in the same alley that Bahni was last seen.
Now ping Sam's.
Thanks for meeting me here.
My pleasure.
What paper was this for, again?
It's a magazine, actually.
So my sources tell me that you were
the last person to see Bahni.
What did you see first?
Just her alone.
I wasn't sure if she was drunk or what.
But then that guy came up, put his arm around her,
and walked her in here.
And what, they just disappeared?
Did he put her in a car?
What did you see?
Everything.
I saw everything.
It's down here.
What?
Why didn't you tell the authorities?
Because I could have helped her and I didn't,
and I feel bad about that.
I mean, who sees everything and does nothing?
I could have made a difference last night.
Instead, I just walked away.
Well, it isn't too late. Tell them whatever you can
and it could help.
Well, one thing I remember.
When she got right here, he did this.
What the hell are you doing?
You said you wanted to know what he did,
and I'm showing you.
You like this, don't you?
What are you talking about?
Look at you. You're excited.
Is this what you did to Kathy Miller?
Kathy Miller?
I haven't heard that name in a long time.
I remember her.
You should.
You killed her.
All I said was I remember her.
Everyone remembers what happened to her.
We were just talking, Agents.
Sam Burnett...
You're under arrest.
For what?!
Assault. Rossi, I got him.
What were you thinking?
That's him, dad. I know it is.
Then you definitely don't follow him down an alley.
You're a parent, for God's sake.
If Kai did something this...
There's no other word for it than--this stupid,
How would you feel?
There's more to this than Kathy Miller, isn't there?
The week before she disappeared,
I went to a frat party.
I got drunk,
I walked home alone...
and some guy in a ski mask grabbed me
and dragged me into the bushes.
And I screamed and screamed,
and some voice in my head told me
that I needed to get up
because no one was coming to rescue me.
And so I fought and I scratched at him
and I jabbed my thumb in his eye,
and then he ran off.
But you know what I didn't do?
You didn't report it.
At college they talk about drunk girls a certain way,
like it's their fault if they get attacked.
It's so unfair.
Especially when a week later, another girl
goes missing because I didn't tell anyone.
It's not the same guy.
Dad...
The guy who hurt Kathy was organized.
He had a place to take her.
The dirtbag who attacked you was impulsive.
He hadn't thought that far ahead.
Well, none of this is helping Bahni.
Unless Sam gave you some new details.
Kathy Miller? I haven't heard that name in a long time.
Dad, it's how he said it.
He got off toying with you.
I really thought I had more than this.
Go back to the beginning,
Right before he admits to seeing everything.
And what, they just disappeared?
Did he put her in a car?
What did you see?
He paused when you asked about the car.
It's the only time he did that. Everything else
he answered without hesitation.
Maybe he avoided the question
because he didn't want to give you a clue.
Penelope, we need you to pull up the security cameras again.
Run registrations on all vehicles
on or around the campus after midnight.
This is...
this is what I always order when I--
I know.
How long have you been watching me?
Long enough to know that I wanted you.
I'm trusting you.
I'm looking at the vehicles from earlier
and there's nothing extraordinary
about them or their owners.
Any of them belong to Judy Temple students?
Two, but we already know they went home for the weekend.
Some of Sam Burnett's story is true.
The unsub likely walked off with his arm around Bahni,
and it's highly doubtful that he would have
taken the chance to hurt her in public.
Yeah, but then they just disappeared.
Well, because he took her away,
likely in a vehicle that fit in.
Campus Security should have a list of vehicles
that are authorized to drive onto campus.
Cross-check those against your list.
Checking registrations.
There's a car. It looks like it's in the neighborhood.
It delivers Chinese food to campus.
Does Bahni order from them?
All the flippin' time.
Who's it registered to?
22-year-old Tom Larson. No criminal record.
Check for juvenile offenses.
Oh. Bingo.
Lots of misdemeanor peeping offenses in his teens.
It doesn't look like it's a coincidence.
And every time he got busted,
he'd end up in the hospital
with bruises and broken bones.
Probably an abusive father. Was Child Services ever called?
Looks like the mom explained it away,
until she committed suicide years ago.
You want to bet that she received the brunt of his abuse?
Oh, no takers on that bet.
Looks like the elder Larson had a heart attack last year
according to medical records,
and the son is the primary caregiver.
Caring for his own father who beat him,
it was only a matter of time before he snapped.
We don't have two monsters, we have 3.
Garcia, send the address to Rossi and JJ.
What are you doing?
No! Uhh!
Help! Aah!
What the hell's going on up here?!
Please, help me.
That's that -- that's that girl from the news.
Dad, you --
What have you done?!
Thank you. Thank you.
Tommy.
Close the door, Tommy.
We gotta get rid of her.
No.
No!
We're 3 miles out.
Stay away from me!
Dad, don't.
You made this mess, and we're gonna clean it up.
No!
She's mine.
Not anymore.
I want to keep her.
Dad, don't!
What, are you crazy?
You don't record what we're about to do.
You moron.
Grow a pair and be a man.
We gotta clean this mess up.
How's this for being a man?
FBI! Drop your weapon!
Get it off, get it off,
Get it off, get it off!
I need a knife.
He's gone, right?
He's not coming back?
Do you even know what you did, Tom?
Ok.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I knew.
There you go. It's ok.
Aasia.
I got nothing to say until my lawyer gets here.
Except, the little recording that bitch made is inadmissible.
Even I know that.
Maybe so, but she's my daughter.
And that recording gave us probable cause
for a search warrant.
So you have a thing for necklaces.
See this?
Kathy Miller's initials.
Her grandmother gave it to her.
All right, let's make a deal.
Let's not.
We tied him to the murder of 3 of the victims,
including Kathy Miller.
Look, we need to talk.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I went off to meet him.
You're right. It was --
I'm stupid and reckless.
That's not what I meant.
What you survived in college is trauma.
It doesn't just go away because we do good
for somebody else.
You need to talk to someone.
Like your old man, maybe.
Because I won't lecture.
I'll just listen.
Hang on.
That's my editor.
This is Joy Rossi.
Just send me the latest version.
Thanks.
Joy Rossi?
I didn't get to use the name Rossi growing up,
so I thought I'd try a new byline.
What do you think?
I think I need to get a subscription to "Esquire""
"To a father,
nothing is dearer than a daughter."
Euripides.
You were that little once.
It seems impossible, doesn't it,
that we all start out so helpless.
And we all end the same way.
Are you gonna call your mom?
It's not too late there, is it?
Tell her I said hi.
I will.
Hey, mom.
I'm good. How are you feeling?
What do you think about me coming out
to visit for a little while?
Hey, baby girl --
Leave it off, please?
What are you doing?
What's up?
I'm scared.
Not the unnerved but you know
I'll pull through kind of scared.
I'm scared scared.
I'm right here.
Talk to me.
Hotch told me to review everything
that I had on the Dirty Dozen.
So I went back to look at the botnets
I used for the original search.
Botnets, what's that?
Think linked computer systems completely randomized
with anonymous proxy servers
so no one can hack me. Make sense?
I don't pay attention to how many botnets I use.
It's like when you google something,
you don't pay attention to the numbers,
you just pay attention to the search results.
But when I went back to look at the digital breadcrumbs,
someone was counting me.
I used 12 botnets, Derek.
You're the Dirty Dozen?
My filters work good, but if these hitmen
are as good as think they are,
they could use a reverse worm protocol and then they could --
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Would they know it was you?
They would know it was someone at fbi.gov at Quantico.
That's why I shut everything down.
But it's just a matter of time --
No. No.
I'm not about to let anything happen to you.
They killed Montolo at a super max
and you were right there.
You can't stop them, Derek.
No one can stop them.
