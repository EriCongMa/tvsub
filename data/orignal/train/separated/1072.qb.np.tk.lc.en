the mosconi codex .
you &apos;re gonna steal it for me .
when does it end ?
you left him bleeding on the sidewalk .
i didn &apos;t kill the dude .
i pulled that badge and gun out of the trash , i swear .
summers told us where she hid the $ 2 million ,
but it wasn &apos;t there .
a chiropractor &apos;s office ?
it &apos;ll look the part .
agent gruetzner . we &apos;ve been expecting you .
any reason he &apos;d slip away to come here ?
neal always has a reason .
if this book is a puzzle ,
maybe these are the pieces .
this stained glass window
could be right here in manhattan .
this is where neal was standing .
for 20 minutes ,
after which he went straight home ,
according to his anklet .
from this intersection , you could scout a museum ,
two banks , and a gallery ,
not to mention all the residential targets .
peter , i made some calls .
there was no suspicious activity reported .
not unless you count neal caffrey being here .
you think i &apos;m overreacting ?
no , i just think we might consider the possibility
that caffrey was just picking up some groceries .
long walk for a loaf of bread .
okay .
so what was he doing there ?
first , there was the missing cash ,
then the fbi pen at the chiropractor &apos;s office ,
and now this street corner .
so what do you think it all adds up to ?
that &apos;s the problem .
i can &apos;t see how it all connects .
i &apos;m missing something .
see if any cameras in the area picked up anything .
will do .
listen , i also ran the card
that you found in siegel &apos;s badge .
talked to the real estate company .
no one knew what &quot; cooper 3 ? &quot; meant .
i looked through siegel &apos;s old case files ,
friends and family back in chicago .
hell , i even looked on google .
no hits . sorry .
listen , i hate to ask you this ,
but you don &apos;t think caffrey knows anything
that he &apos;s not telling us , do you ?
about siegel ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t .
all right .
checked black market code words ,
drop locations , c.i. names .
mozzie even tried to tie it to d.b. cooper .
nothing .
maybe it &apos;s an fbi agent grasping at straws .
we both know your instincts are rarely wrong .
well , for now , we &apos;ve got a stolen shipping crate
that demands our attention .
grabbed from canadian customs this morning
by a fraudulent trucking company .
the driver ran . no sign of him yet .
must be some exotic canadian contraband
to get you out of the office .
oh , this is well worth a stretch of my legs .
don &apos;t tell me .
it &apos;s diamonds from the diavik mine in the northwest territories .
maybe it &apos;s maple syrup .
you joke , but the great canadian maple syrup heist
was worth 18 million .
you &apos;d need a bigger crate though .
and a lot of pancakes .
special agent burke . go ahead .
it &apos;s like christmas morning .
no , it &apos;s not a gift . this is stolen property .
i know the line gets blurry for you .
based on the size of the box and the country of origin ,
my best guess is a sculpture from emanuel hahn ,
canadian artist , circa 1918 .
oh , this is better than christmas .
this is a dinosaur egg .
even now you kind of expect it to crack open , don &apos;t you ?
i really don &apos;t .
a fossilized egg doesn &apos;t capture your imagination ?
well , the value of it does .
hello ? excuse me .
i &apos;m dr. khatri .
i &apos;m one of the curators of the natural history museum .
agent peter burke .
you &apos;re the one who found my egg .
well , he can &apos;t take all the credit .
and where &apos;s the mother ?
what do you mean ?
there was a second shipment containing the mother .
what kind of mother ?
a tyrannosaurus rex .
you &apos;re saying there &apos;s a tyrannosaurus rex
lost somewhere in new york city ?
tyrannosaurus rex was being shipped simultaneously
on a different truck .
no sign of it anywhere .
hunting a t @-@ rex .
seven @-@ year @-@ old me would be going crazy .
adult you isn &apos;t exactly serene .
i can &apos;t wait to see it in person
when it &apos;s reunited with its egg .
mozzie used to create fake fossils
and bury them at dig sites .
used to ?
it &apos;s been a couple months .
the alternate history of the earth according to mozzie .
that &apos;s terrifying .
i &apos;m just saying , the black market is rife
with fake fossils like this .
do we know the egg is real ?
khatri ran an acid test and authenticated it .
well , people with way too much money and no subtlety
do love to put them in their office
as a display of power .
yeah , what bigger display than a t @-@ rex and its egg ?
whoever the buyer is ,
it &apos;s clear they want the entire set .
valuable alone , invaluable together .
it &apos;s like having queen mary &apos;s diamond riviere
without the la peregrina pearl .
jones is working on a list of suspects .
i gotta get home . what are your plans tonight ?
i &apos;m just gonna relax at home .
do a little light reading .
i &apos;m really happy that you called .
i found something , and i brought something .
yeah , i should &apos;ve mentioned ...
agent gruetzner will be joining us .
hello .
a rare book expert and a wine connoisseur .
oh , california zin .
well , there &apos;s no shame in having one specialty .
you said you found something ?
uh ... yes .
yes , i did .
so i was looking into the stained glass window ,
and i stumbled across this .
oh ! mosconi &apos;s grave site .
uh , yes .
just look down here at the bottom .
it &apos;s a masonic compass .
so he was a mason .
i should have noticed it sooner .
i mean , this is why he put the chapter 13
into the codex .
13 is considered a sacred number for the brotherhood .
he was sending a message to the other masons .
the codex could lead us anywhere .
i mean , masons have their hands in everything .
finance , government , art .
untimely death .
look at the date on the gravestone .
april 17 , 1887 .
that &apos;s the same month he finished the window .
that must have been his final work .
do you think that he was killed
because of all of this ?
if that &apos;s so ,
the stained glass could tell us why .
well , thanks for everything . we &apos;ll take it from here .
okay , i &apos;ll leave you to it .
yes , thank you for coming over and for the wine .
sure .
dinner on wednesday without the chaperone ?
of course , agent caffrey .
i look forward to working with you more
on all of this .
what ?
i got it under control .
well , i hate to report the obvious news ,
but the last thing you are right now is under control .
luckily , you have a guardian angel
looking over you .
this is less angel and more stalker .
i vetted her ,
a cursory audit .
financials , education , daily schedule .
she keeps a tight routine , speaks three languages ,
studied two years in france .
here , just keep it . just in case .
t @-@ rex and her egg were owned legally
by a man in toronto for 50 years .
he kept it in his family room
until he died three months ago .
that &apos;s a hell of a pet to get your kids .
big pooper scooper .
he dictated that , upon his death ,
it be donated to the museum .
i &apos;m guessing someone tried to persuade the estate
to sell it instead .
lots of someones .
who do we like ?
well , there &apos;s a number of people
who pursued it very aggressively .
lots of escalating offers .
and a lot of suspicious people making them .
anyone only try once ?
yeah , there were two single bids .
i mean , one was a lowball offer ,
but then there &apos;s this guy .
he made a single high @-@ priced offer , then nothing .
brett forsythe , corporate raider ,
made millions from hostile takeovers .
i &apos;ve heard of him .
he led a takeover of a company called aegis last year .
that &apos;s the kind of guy
who knows when someone &apos;s not gonna sell ,
and his only option is to take what he wants .
i &apos;m gonna pay him a visit .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. forsythe is unavailable at the moment .
of course he is .
well , if you could tell him
that agent burke of the fbi ,
white collar division ,
would like to speak with him .
i can wait here as long as it takes .
i &apos;m sure these guys would love to keep me company .
that &apos;s probably her boss
telling her that i can see him now .
when you took over aegis ,
the board didn &apos;t know you &apos;d stolen their company
until you walked through the door
and fired all of them .
that was my legal right , agent burke .
it was .
and then you sold off pieces of the company one by one ,
made a great profit .
lost a lot of jobs .
the feds questioned me about the aegis takeover a month ago .
it was all aboveboard .
i know .
why are you here ?
is that a velociraptor skull ?
yeah .
i should sell it .
thanks to jurassic park ,
everyone thinks they &apos;re an expert on them .
except the movie got everything wrong .
velociraptors were
most likely feathered ,
based on the quill knobs
found by paleontologists .
and the film made them much larger ,
more like the size of a deinonychus .
that &apos;s true .
velociraptors were closer to the size of a chicken .
still , one mean @-@ looking chicken .
and very dangerous .
are you a collector ?
oh , on a government salary ?
i &apos;d barely be able to afford an ankle joint .
how &apos;d you get it ?
there are many legal ways to purchase fossils , agent .
true .
many illegal ways as well .
that why you &apos;re here ?
to question the legality of my velociraptor ?
no , i &apos;m hunting something bigger .
a t @-@ rex .
thought you said you weren &apos;t a collector .
it &apos;s not for me .
it was supposed to go to a museum
but didn &apos;t make it there .
agent burke , even if i stole a tyrannosaurus rex ,
which i did not ,
what would i do with it ?
it &apos;s not like i could just put it on display .
that &apos;s a good point .
but what a thing to have .
you think he has an actual skeleton in his closet ?
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s hiding in there ,
but there was a large open space
right underneath the raptor skull .
well , he stalled when you got there .
that gave him time to move it .
so chances are it &apos;s illegal .
is that what takes you so long
to come to the door when i knock ?
you think i &apos;m hiding illicit goods under my bed ?
i think you &apos;re hiding something .
but i don &apos;t have enough for a warrant
to search forsythe &apos;s office .
you should stake it out , see what happens .
especially around 6 : 00 p.m.
i &apos;ll keep an eye out for anything suspicious .
you said the empty space was near the raptor skull ?
yeah , right underneath .
it &apos;s not empty anymore .
now there &apos;s a mean @-@ looking club there .
looks pre @-@ columbian .
forsythe must have moved it back after i left .
as long as i &apos;m here ,
i should see what else he &apos;s hiding .
no , get the picture , and get out .
the trick with sliding locks
is they leave a smudge that can tell you what the code is .
this does not sound like you getting out .
the key is guessing where it starts and where it ends .
is he right or left @-@ handed ?
right . why ?
right @-@ handed people
instinctively draw counterclockwise .
i told you to get out .
forsythe has a whole lab back here .
microscopes , test tubes ,
all kinds of forensic equipment .
forsythe came back .
almost done .
did you set off an alarm ?
peter , that &apos;s hurtful .
either way , he &apos;s headed your way .
all right , leaving now .
where are you ?
where are you ?
it &apos;s called a macuahuitl .
&quot; macua @-@ neenle . &quot;
no , &quot; macua @-@ heetle . &quot;
&quot; macua @-@ heednum . &quot;
no , &quot; macua @-@ heetle . &quot;
i said that .
okay , either way , your hunch is right .
it was stolen from a pre @-@ columbian exhibit
here in new york .
i guess forsythe does some business
in the black market after all .
yeah , but get this . it was stolen eight years ago .
statute of limitations is up .
forsythe &apos;s a smart guy .
he knows we can &apos;t get him on it .
sure , he didn &apos;t want to raise
a red flag in front of a bull .
not when he &apos;s hiding something bigger .
for a job as big as a t @-@ rex ,
he &apos;d wanna use somebody he can trust ,
somebody he &apos;d used before .
any suspects in the macuahuitl theft ?
there were no arrests , but there were three suspects .
one &apos;s in jail .
one recently questioned in prague .
then there &apos;s this guy , michael holt .
suspected in four other robberies along the east coast .
he doesn &apos;t stay in one place very long .
no , but even a master thief needs time to unload
a 40 @-@ foot prehistoric skeleton .
either way , we &apos;ve got a narrow window
before he leaves town .
track him down .
before we do ,
you wanna know why caffrey
was standing on that street corner ?
yeah , i do .
what do you have ?
not what . it &apos;s who .
i got this off a security camera from across the street .
she looks familiar .
her name &apos;s rebecca lowe .
yeah , the woman we brought in
from the gershon heist a while back .
what &apos;s neal doing with her ?
you know , i was talking to el ,
she has a friend she &apos;d like to set you up with .
does this friend know that i come with a rap sheet ?
interested ?
tell elizabeth thank you , but i &apos;m not looking right now .
well , it &apos;s been a while since sara ,
and i thought you might wanna get back out there .
not that it &apos;s difficult for you .
you &apos;d be surprised .
anyone i date , i have to lie to
or wonder why she &apos;s interested in a felon .
no luck at all ?
yeah , jones ?
where to ?
yeah .
okay , thanks .
holt &apos;s gone .
jones checked his credit cards .
he bought a plane ticket out of the country .
the only reason i &apos;d buy a plane ticket under my name
with my credit card is if i wanted someone
to think i &apos;d left the country .
the airline confirmed that he got on the plane .
the airline confirmed someone with holt &apos;s ticket got on the plane .
you know that time you thought i was in monaco ?
don &apos;t tell me
that i had interpol scouring the streets for nothing .
bought a first @-@ class ticket under my name
and checked in for my flight .
once i got to the gate ,
i looked for someone traveling alone with a carry @-@ on .
if someone checks a bag
and doesn &apos;t get on the plane ,
the flight doesn &apos;t take off .
so i offer them my ticket ,
which of course they &apos;re gonna take .
because no sane person facing a 3,000 @-@ mile trip
is gonna say no to a seat in first class .
and they don &apos;t suspect an ulterior motive ?
not everyone is as naturally suspicious as you , peter .
my nature has developed
from years of tracking your suspicious behavior .
so this unsuspecting stranger
gets your ticket , gets on the plane .
and neal caffrey is on his way to monaco ,
while the real neal caffrey
slips out of the gate unnoticed .
i can &apos;t believe you never knew that .
cameras caught michael holt
scoping out their security system .
he &apos;s still after that egg .
he thinks it &apos;s at the museum .
catching holt in the act
is our best shot at tracking down that stolen t @-@ rex .
i &apos;ll put surveillance teams
outside the museum around the clock .
keep me posted .
all right .
well , i guess someone else enjoyed that first @-@ class ticket .
so .
holt had 1 / 2 million good reasons to stay .
how did you know what forsythe was gonna pay holt ?
i found a briefcase full of cash in his back room .
and you opened it ?
see , this is the reason i have a suspicious nature .
i &apos;m gonna count every penny of it .
i don &apos;t blame you . you should .
it was a rough estimate though ,
it &apos;s a round number .
hey , hon .
yeah .
how &apos;d you like to go on a double date tonight ?
with trey and sheila ?
neal .
does he know we &apos;re coming ?
he doesn &apos;t know we &apos;re coming .
he &apos;s been sneaking around with this woman ,
and i think he &apos;s up to something .
or maybe he &apos;s having a nice meal with a nice girl .
there &apos;s no reason for neal to keep this from me .
what do i care if he &apos;s going on a date with a girl ?
clearly you care quite a bit .
nah , there &apos;s more to it than this .
a lot of things neal has been doing don &apos;t add up ,
and my gut tells me she &apos;s at the center of it .
now according to his anklet ,
they &apos;re at the clifton .
you know i &apos;ve always wanted to go to the clifton .
really ?
you think this is a good idea ?
i do .
thought you might like this .
the wine is lovely .
and it reminds me of this summer that i spent in france studying .
i actually think i &apos;ve been to this vineyard .
really ?
really .
did you have the fbi run a background check on me ?
the fbi had nothing to do with this dinner .
i promise .
you know , you never told me
why you became an fbi agent .
i assume it wasn &apos;t only to pick up women .
how does an art lover become an fbi agent ?
it &apos;s a long story .
i spend my life studying ancient texts .
i don &apos;t mind long stories .
i want this dinner to be about you and me , okay ?
we don &apos;t need to talk about work .
all right .
i really do like this place .
and the wine and the codex .
and the kiss .
i liked that part too .
you know , you-- you don &apos;t have to do all this
just to get my help on the case .
do you really think i would do that ?
no .
what kind of guy do you think i am ?
i don &apos;t know . you &apos;re an fbi agent .
yeah .
if it &apos;s too complicated , i &apos;ll understand .
are you trying to give me a way out ?
apparently without much subtlety .
no .
i don &apos;t want one .
do you ?
no .
neal ?
peter , what are you doing here ?
elizabeth has been dying to try this place out .
hi , i &apos;m peter , neal &apos;s boss .
we &apos;ve met . i &apos;m rebecca .
you almost arrested me .
oh , right . sorry about that .
no , it &apos;s-- wait , i thought your boss was ...
and this is elizabeth , peter &apos;s lovely wife .
it &apos;s so nice to meet you .
i &apos;m really sorry for interrupting .
oh , nonsense .
no secrets between friends , right ?
course not .
i didn &apos;t know that you two had been in touch
since the investigation .
you guys met on a case ?
oh , yeah , you know .
how sometimes your personal and professional lives
just crash into each other without any notice .
it &apos;s actually how peter and i met .
yeah , agency resources were involved from what i recall .
it was completely aboveboard .
actually , we were just talking
about how neal became an fbi agent .
yeah , but it &apos;s a long story .
i know i &apos;d love to hear that story .
um , i &apos;m gonna go check and see if we can get a table .
would you like to go with me ?
maybe let the boys chat ?
of course .
see you in a little bit .
what are you doing here ?
did you follow me here ?
you have until they come back
to explain why she thinks you &apos;re an fbi agent ,
or i &apos;m telling her the truth .
we met on a case .
i told her i work for the fbi .
she assumed i was an agent .
and you didn &apos;t correct her , did you ?
i didn &apos;t see any reason to .
because you &apos;re impersonating a federal officer .
i suppose technically--
no , not technically . you are .
the pen , the chiropractor &apos;s office .
this is all to convince her of this story .
you &apos;re--
you like her , don &apos;t you ?
lying is a funny way of showing it .
she doesn &apos;t look at me like a criminal , okay ?
she looks at me
the way el looks at you .
i don &apos;t want to ruin that .
neal , you have lovely friends .
oh , aren &apos;t they great ?
we are gonna get out of your hair right now .
we got a table . come on , let &apos;s go .
sure .
you two have lots to talk about .
excuse me one minute .
this is agent burke .
it &apos;s dr. khatri .
someone &apos;s here .
i don &apos;t recognize him .
all right , remain calm , doctor .
we have agents in the museum .
no , i &apos;m not there .
i took the egg to my lab to run a cat scan .
hang up and find someplace safe .
we &apos;ll be there soon .
neal , we have to go .
dr. khatri &apos;s in trouble .
nypd is on the way , but we &apos;re closer .
we &apos;re running out of time !
you better tell me where it is !
what , you think i &apos;m playing games ?
i &apos;ll never give it to you .
it &apos;s holt .
i &apos;m not gonna ask again .
if we go in with guns drawn , he might shoot her .
khatri &apos;s not giving up that egg .
we gotta come up with something ,
or she &apos;s gonna get herself killed .
where the hell is the egg ?
where is the mother ? what have you done with her ?
it &apos;s just an egg . tell me where it is .
it &apos;s so much more than that .
it is a child that needs to be with its mother ,
and i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;ll ever give it up to you .
have it your way .
doctor , do you have the isotopic results--
hold it right there .
i don &apos;t want any trouble , okay ?
where is the damn egg ?
i &apos;ll show you .
no , you can &apos;t give it to him .
i &apos;m not taking a bullet for a fossil , all right ?
follow me .
right through here .
get off of me !
give me a hand .
not every thief who brings their own handcuffs .
very thoughtful of you .
holt confirmed that forsythe hired him
for the fossil heist .
so why are you not doing
an &quot; about to get the dinosaur &quot; happy dance ?
because he doesn &apos;t know where the dinosaur is located .
and if we arrest forsythe now ,
there &apos;s no guarantee we &apos;ll get the t @-@ rex back .
and our evidence is largely circumstantial .
i want hard proof .
you want the dinosaur .
damn right i do .
dr. khatri will be happy to hear that .
just got off with the hospital .
she &apos;s fine ,
just a little shaken up .
there &apos;s only one chip we can play right now .
the egg .
we can plant a tracker on it .
i bet he &apos;ll stash it with the t @-@ rex fossils .
follow him , make a clean arrest .
i don &apos;t wanna put the egg in play .
it &apos;s too valuable , too important .
lucky for us ,
we know someone with a history of forging fossils .
dr. khatri gave me fragments
of real calcite shell and sedimentary rock .
i &apos;ll sculpt the core from alabaster .
adhesives ?
already mixed .
we should get started .
i assume you don &apos;t mean the royal we ?
a correct assumption .
the hydrochloric acid is reacting perfectly
with the calcium carbonate in the shell .
we made a baby dinosaur , moz .
ah , like father , like forged embryo .
each with his own anklet .
at least peter won &apos;t be able to follow this tracker to rebecca .
oh , have you spoken to her since your ill @-@ fated dinner ?
i warned you , neal .
you , business , and women .
unholy trinity , i get it .
well , you can be grateful
that the suit didn &apos;t expose your agent nom de guerre .
well , i am .
what happens when peter digs deeper ?
could find out about the codex .
yeah , or hagen .
cause for concern .
keep in mind , to make an end is to make a beginning .
you think i should end it with her ?
that was t.s. eliot .
but if rebecca is on big brother &apos;s radar ,
the timing could be right .
all right , do we have a game plan for the church yet ?
i &apos;m working on it .
but to steal the stained glass window
will be difficult with so many witnesses .
well , that &apos;s a problem that can wait a day .
indeed .
today we revive the cretaceous period .
tomorrow we steal a window
that could be connected to a bedlamite &apos;s tome .
c &apos;est la vie .
c &apos;est la vie .
not bad .
i was gonna give it to you after this ,
but if you don &apos;t think it &apos;s very good--
&quot; not bad &quot; doesn &apos;t mean &quot; not good . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t mean &quot; good . &quot;
i &apos;ll give it to someone who can appreciate it .
no , this is fbi property . i can take it if i want .
okay , the tracker &apos;s live .
when forsythe moves the egg , we &apos;ll be right behind him .
neal , tell us about your cover .
john mcdowell . accomplice to michael holt .
here to deliver the egg .
because the fbi is looking into holt , and he &apos;s laying low .
which was confirmed by holt
when he called forsythe to set up the meeting .
we &apos;ll have ears on you the whole time .
with a forgery like this , you should be out quickly .
with half million in cash .
the fbi is investigating holt ?
should i worry ?
nah , it &apos;s just one agent shaking every tree he can find
to see what falls out .
he doesn &apos;t have anything .
but to be safe , i &apos;m here instead of holt .
hey , if you don &apos;t want the egg anymore ,
i &apos;m sure i can unload it somewhere else .
no , no , no , no . it &apos;s fine .
i wanna see it .
uh @-@ uh . no , it &apos;s not yours yet .
not till you pay me .
you &apos;re getting ahead of yourself .
i need to authenticate it first .
let &apos;s get a move on .
ticktock .
calcite levels and pebble texture appear appropriate .
i assume that &apos;s good news .
oh , it very much is .
then i think this is the part where you pay me .
i will .
after one last test .
can &apos;t tell you how many times
two @-@ bit hustlers have tried to rip me off
with fake artifacts .
which is where the cat scan comes in handy .
he won &apos;t see an embryo on a cat scan .
but he will see the tracker .
the scan will take about ten minutes .
so settle in .
look , i didn &apos;t think this was gonna be an all @-@ day thing . okay ?
you worried the scan won &apos;t work ?
no , i just don &apos;t understand what this thing is gonna show you
that all the other tests didn &apos;t .
it &apos;ll show me what &apos;s inside .
or what isn &apos;t .
we need to pull neal out of there .
wait , dr. khatri should have a cat scan of the egg .
i &apos;ll call to see if she can send one to us .
you ever heard of a macuahuitl ?
it &apos;s the weapon you &apos;re holding in your hands right now .
what else can you tell me about this weapon , john ?
anything about this one in particular ?
i stole it for you eight years ago
with holt right here in new york .
you &apos;re holding it wrong .
you mind ?
the early macuahuitl handle is 2 inches wider at the top .
hold it like this .
better grip means a faster swing .
more control .
you &apos;re right .
you know , i &apos;ve stolen a lot of things ,
but i &apos;ve rarely taken anything just to have it .
you should try it sometime .
we should be at the embryo any moment now .
yeah ?
why is he here ?
fine .
i &apos;ll be right there .
who &apos;s here ?
that fbi agent . still shaking his trees .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll get rid of him .
mr. forsythe , thanks for seeing me .
i won &apos;t take up much of your time .
michael holt , he &apos;s our prime suspect
in the fossil shipment theft .
what &apos;s it got to do with me ?
i was wondering if maybe he approached you on buying them .
well , if he contacts me , you &apos;ll be my first call .
all i wanted to hear .
then you &apos;ll be on your way .
you know , even though their name means &quot; speedy thief , &quot;
they say that the velociraptor wasn &apos;t particularly fast .
that &apos;s true .
and that it was dumb .
yeah , not much room for a brain in there , i guess .
one slow , dumb chicken with big teeth .
don &apos;t touch the skull .
how do you keep them glued in there ?
epoxy or tacky ?
agent burke , don &apos;t--
guess you should &apos;ve used superglue .
is that all ?
mm @-@ hmm .
sorry i broke your dinosaur .
well , look at that .
money &apos;s in the briefcase .
pleasure doing business with you .
the things people do when they think no one &apos;s watching .
like following your friend to a first date
and crashing it ?
come on .
let &apos;s show forsythe how the fbi handles natural selection .
you just think of that one ?
yeah , on the way over .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i thought about what you said .
i figured out what i wanna take .
how &apos;d you follow me ?
that little guy told me where you were .
or at least a gps tracker we put inside it did .
let &apos;s go .
open it up .
okay , that definitely captures my imagination .
you know , it &apos;s not too late for you to be a paleontologist .
some things are better enjoyed from a distance .
oh , like grand larceny .
are all of your hobbies illegal ?
i like chess .
you hustled chess in union square .
agent burke .
mr. caffrey , follow me .
you need to see this .
here she is .
she &apos;s ...
majestic .
this mother and child reunion
was only possible because of you two .
the museum is in your debt .
i know someone who would love a year @-@ round pass .
agent burke , you have vip status here .
our doors are always open .
peter burke , vip . we should get you a badge .
quiet . thank you , doctor .
thank you .
come by the house for dinner tonight .
el &apos;s cooking branzino .
branzino , look at you .
i can be fancy .
thanks for the invitation , but--
it &apos;s not an invitation .
so it &apos;s an order ?
7 p.m.
don &apos;t be late , agent caffrey .
bad news .
another amazing meal .
well , it should be . it &apos;s your recipe .
should &apos;ve thrown it on a barbecue .
never let him be sous chef .
he &apos;s actually very good on the barbecue .
so ... rebecca .
yeah , rebecca .
what do you wanna know ?
have you told her everything ?
everything ?
why you &apos;re working for the fbi ?
why you &apos;re wearing an anklet ?
has she seen it ?
okay , i was waiting for the right time .
there &apos;s no right time , neal .
what do you think happens if i tell her the truth ?
the more time passes ,
the more the truth will hurt .
if you really want this to work ,
tell her now .
pray she &apos;ll accept it .
you agree ?
if you really care about rebecca ,
she deserves to know the real you .
okay , if peter had told you something like this
when you first met , would you have accepted it ?
honestly , neal , i-- i don &apos;t know .
but i &apos;d want the choice to decide .
and so will rebecca .
it &apos;s a risk you should take .
i don &apos;t wanna ask why you have that thing .
mm , it was there for the taking .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
cheers .
cheers .
byron always said the city spoke to him .
i can relate to that .
you &apos;re a lot like him .
how did you feel when he told you he was a criminal ?
it hurt .
but i loved him .
and it didn &apos;t matter what he was .
it only mattered who he was .
i wish i could separate the two .
well , you &apos;ll learn with time .
just a second .
hey . find something new ?
yeah .
great .
no .
i was gonna lie , pretend i found something ,
but i just wanted to come see you .
whatever this is between us ,
i ... i don &apos;t want it to stop .
i don &apos;t either .
yeah ?
but there &apos;s something you should know about me .
okay .
i &apos;m not an fbi agent .
i &apos;m a criminal informant .
i was convicted of bond forgery
and served part of a four @-@ year sentence
before i became a c.i.
i &apos;m--i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;ve been to your office .
i &apos;ve been working with your boss , agent gruetzner .
yeah , he &apos;s not my boss .
my real boss is peter burke ,
who you met at dinner .
that office was just a setup
to get your help with the codex .
you set up a fake office all so you could lie to me ?
are you even researching the codex ?
i am .
just not for the fbi .
rebecca .
why would you do this to me ?
i needed your help , all right ?
and i--
i didn &apos;t expect this .
i didn &apos;t expect us .
is there anything else i should know ?
thank you .
i think i was just--
june !
neal !
i was just chatting with this wonderful man ,
mr ...
you can call me &quot; curtis . &quot;
curtis . it &apos;s a lovely name .
thank you .
well , i think ...
i &apos;ll just be running along .
you stay away from her , hagen .
quite the life you &apos;ve built .
hate to see things fall apart over one little window .
that &apos;s right , i know that the codex leads to the window .
isn &apos;t it lucky you were already planning to steal it for me ?
that was what you were planning , wasn &apos;t it ?
of course .
good .
that would be best for everyone .
