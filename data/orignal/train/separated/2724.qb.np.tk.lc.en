three ladies , gentlemen .

it &apos;s an &quot; environment and event coordinator . &quot;
what the hell . she &apos;s my only daughter .
she and iris have their hearts set on makin &apos; the vows column
of the sunday &quot; new york times ... &quot; featured couple of the week .
our publicist is lookin &apos; for a hook .
turns out that gillian &apos;s law degree from harvard means bupkis .
everybody &apos;s got that or better .
if it was a black couple or a gay couple they &apos;d be in .
my wife calls &quot; the times &quot; wedding section the ladies &apos; sports page .
so ira , who &apos;s the lucky guy ?
jeremy silverman , puppeteer ,
children &apos;s television workshop .
father &apos;s asa silverman , head of commercial paper at goldman sachs .
upper eastside .
i didn &apos;t get my invitation .
fuck you .
you told me to be sure to let you know when it was a quarter of .
thank you , mary .
okay .
so with wesleyan as your fallback , i think we &apos;re in pretty good shape .
straight &quot; a &quot; s at middlebury &apos;s language camp , can &apos;t sneeze at that .
your blues folkloric studies in mississippi last summer
have an almost community @-@ service spin to them .
i wish he had the minority thing going for him .
if we can nudge lem &apos;s verbals past 760 on the next round ,
he can basically write his own ticket.i &apos;m stoked .
appreciate your help .
folks ?
so let me guess ... he called the english teacher &quot; daddy @-@ o . &quot;
he called the english teacher &quot; daddy @-@ o . &quot;
the thing is ...
we are rapidly approaching crisis mode here
with these grades , and time is of the essence .
could i ask a question ?
i handed in my final list of colleges . did you get that ?
yes , we talked about this .
so , ramapo and trenton state .
and our reach schools , university of arizona and arizona state .
i &apos;ll take him out there after i drive him around to the ones in new jersey .
if either of the arizona &apos;s is what he &apos;s got his heart set on ,
he &apos;s not gonna get in with these grades.i know about football , anthony .
that &apos;s our ace in the hole.he says he &apos;s tryin &apos; his best .
s.a.t. -wise , 505 and 430 ...
i think we can edge up the math into the fives in the next round ,
providing anthony can bear down and focus.he &apos;s had trouble with that before .
remember , carm , when they thought he had a.d.d. ?
you didn &apos;t tell me that .
head on back to class . let us talk .
let us talk.but if i &apos;m learning @-@ disabled ,
i get unlimited time on my s.a.t.s.
is that true ?
let &apos;s talk about that later .
so you had time to talk directly to dr. rapke about last week &apos;s testing results .
yes . she said anthony has good interpersonal skills .
she said his affect was ...
now , where is this ... &quot; constricted , &quot; she called it .
but that was normal for a teenager and ...
all in all he seemed to be handling the split well .
this is not to say i don &apos;t get a ration of shit in every conversation .
pardon my french .
well , still , uh ...
there is this thing with his grades .
do you think it would be of benefit to him to see a psychologist
on a regular basis ?
you don &apos;t approve of therapy , mr. soprano .
people use it as a crutch .
and i always wonder what happened to gary cooper ,
the strong silent type ?
well , gary cooper wasn &apos;t a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
he was at one time .
and i &apos;m gonna have to agree with my husband here , mr. wegler .
we sent our daughter to a ... an adolescent developmentalist
and it was a disaster .
i know my son , he &apos;s lazy .
we &apos;re gonna get him a different s.a.t. tutor ,
i &apos;m gonna stay on him and he &apos;s gonna work harder .
and that &apos;s that .
i might be learning @-@ disabled .
didn &apos;t he tell you to go to class ?
what &apos;s going on , mary ?
domenica paolini and sasha caputo ,
they were on their way to school this morning and they hit a tree .
nica &apos;s dead . sasha &apos;s in a coma .
what &apos;s that ?
it was here when i got here .
okay , if a million zeroes can be written
on the front and back of a sheet of paper ,
how many sheets of paper do you need for a googol of zeroes ?
oh man , oh baby , an xterra se .
it &apos;s loaded . 3.3- liter supercharged .
what , this is mine ?
yeah .
you are unbelievable .
the sticker &apos;s still on it.he doesn &apos;t have enough distractions ?
after what happened to those kids at his school ?
it &apos;s got sensors in the seatbelts .
it &apos;s part of nissan &apos;s triple safety philosophy .
nice ride .
are you leaving ?
hour &apos;s up.you &apos;re not getting in ?
this is so deck . what is this , bose ?
yeah , six cd changer . it &apos;s got surround sound .
i feel safer already .
carmela , this car is a tank .
what &apos;s the matter ? suvs eat up more of the ozone .
so you wanna be the sucker in a regular car that gets decapitated ?
i &apos;m gonna catch shit at school .
so what do you wanna do ?
screw it . can we take it out ?
yeah , we can take it out . once .
then this baby sits in the garage till you pull your grades up to a &quot; c. &quot;
what ?
you heard your father .
i was talking to him , not you .
i gotta put dinner on . tony , i have bills for you .
you better be nice to your mother .
she &apos;s got the keys till your grades are up .
i &apos;ll be right back .
the car was a motivational tool .
the carrot and the stick , you gotta do both !
i could strangle him sometimes . he can be so hateful .
well , the smart mouth is not good .
that &apos;s minor , believe me .
god , what happened to him ? he was always the sweet one .
he had the concept of sharing before any of the other toddlers .
meadow was always sharper , but i remember the same thing with her .
it &apos;s like watching an angel fall .
what , are you crying ?
here &apos;s the tutor in writing like you had to have .
i had to call rotorooter .
this is a cheap sound system for the media room .
why should i pay for that ?
because you took the last one .
oh , your little movie connoisseur friends are still meeting ?
at least i have friends .
what the fuck &apos;s that mean ?
you just have a bunch of flunkies.what do you know about it ?
they compliment you on your new shoes .
they tell you that you &apos;re not going bald .
you think they really care ?
you &apos;re the boss , they &apos;re scared of you .
they have to kiss your ass , laugh at your stupid jokes .
what about artie then ? you &apos;re turning into a frigging cynic .
whatever . - what do i give a shit ?
i &apos;m running a fucking business not a popularity contest .
&quot; i &apos;ve been thinking ,
and i apologize for my use of fowl language ... &quot;
fowl with a &quot; w ... &quot;
&quot; in regards to yourself .
you said some very hurtful things to me in regards to myself .
but it is still no excuse to use the vile word that i used ,
of which i am sure you know ...
that i &apos;m talking about . &quot;
&quot; cunt , &quot; right ?
yes , elliot .
&quot; you don &apos;t wish us to be social friends
and so that is that .
i still have great rigard for you ,
even though you said some horrible things .
p.s. i &apos;m doing fine , anthony . &quot;
it came with a bathrobe and a basketful of dr. hauschka bath products .
ablution .
the desire to cleanse himself of the deed .
notice he still fundamentally blames me .
hello ? - mrs. soprano ? robert wegler .
oh , hi , hello , how are you ?
uh ... after our meeting the other day ,
i had some ideas about some further strategies for anthony .
i thought maybe we could meet ,
have lunch , cup of coffee . i could share them with you .
next week perhaps ?
really ?
uh ... well yeah , i guess that would be okay .
&quot; happy birthday &quot; by the beatles .
you know , i heard it the other day in the car .
they have such a good drum solo in the middle there .
&quot; drum solo &quot; ?
that &apos;s the basic four @-@ four .
you know ringo was not their original drummer . that was pete best .
and they fired him .
he put out his own album ... &quot; best of the beatles . &quot;
sad .
so , is this what they call common ground ?
just trying to have a civilized conversation .
can i go to my room ? i &apos;m full .
am i so horrible ?
you are not horrible . get over yourself .
&quot; over myself &quot; ? what is that supposed to mean ?
just go , do me a big favor .
if you &apos;re gonna be a martyr , obviously i &apos;ll sit here .
no , go . put your plate in the sink .

he &apos;s doing exactly what he &apos;s supposed to .
he &apos;s testing the limits as much as he can .
i blame myself.what are you talking about ?

he doesn &apos;t hate your guts .
oh , thank god he &apos;s alive .
it &apos;s my fault , tony.my pathetic need to compete with you clouded my judgment
or i never would have let him stay in new york . i knew he wasn &apos;t ready .
i went against all of my instincts .
his eyebrows &apos;ll grow back ! nothing really happened !
no , you know what happened ? i said fuck it . and you know why ?

flat screen tvs . 50 @-@ inch plasma philipses .
guy &apos;s coming down from montreal , but he got delayed a couple of days .
i got a garage right here .

i thought i had a plan for anthony , but l ... i &apos;m not so sure now .
i don &apos;t know if rutgers &apos; summer program accepts boys without eyebrows .
so you heard about that ? i was a wreck .
i mean look what happened to those girls just driving to school .
how &apos;s anthony coping with that ? we brought in grief counselors .
i have to say he never mentioned it .
they all handle tragedy differently .
actually , he just moved in with his father .
i don &apos;t know if he said .
really ?
i don &apos;t know what you might have heard about my husband.some.
i mean , he &apos;s a good father , don &apos;t get me wrong .
our daughter is at columbia.my friends tell me
i &apos;m a snob with this college business , but with anthony it &apos;s something else .
i just know that if he didn &apos;t get into a good enough school to interest him ,
and he dropped out , went to work as a waiter or something ,
he wouldn &apos;t last a week .
you know , he would be drawn right in ... you know .
my husband doesn &apos;t want that for him either .
you met him . my husband can be very magnetic ,
you know , bigger than life .
and i was so young . it was very exciting .
anyway , he &apos;s over there .
maybe it &apos;ll be good , you know ,
learning the things that men need to know .
well ...
anyway , so what about you ? how long have you been at the school ?
since &apos; 86 .
i suppose that &apos;s what caught me up too , with astrid .
some notion of escaping the quotidian .
so you were married .
for about , uh ... five minutes .
chicken marsala .
and the honey balsamic chicken .
thank you .
have you read &quot; madame bovary &quot; ? - no .
it &apos;s almost a perfect novel .
flaubert writes about bourgeois loneliness and emptiness .
emma bovary destroys herself for some fantasy in her head .
it &apos;s great . it &apos;s truly , truly great .
somehow horrifically funny , though tragic .
i think you might enjoy it .
i &apos;ll stop by borders on my way home .
who is it by again ?
gustave flaubert .
yeah ? supervisor curran , parole board .
site visit .
where &apos;s eddie stimich ?
he &apos;s out sick . i just wanna take a look around .
only thing better about here than russia is the food .
good one .
eddie examined every fucking dust bunny in the place just last week .
is that new ?
friend of mine , passed away.bequest.
is that your garage ?
nah , it &apos;s where i make the weapons of mass destruction .
let &apos;s go out and open it up .
you wanna see my fucking garage ? you never seen an oil stain before ?
let &apos;s go .
here &apos;s the windup .
and the pitch ...
ah !
come on ! fuck major league baseball .
ever since the fucking strike . let &apos;s watch ballet .
oh , somebody hotboxed us ?
i saw you close the window .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s when you close the windows and fart on purpose .
that &apos;s a dutch oven.- no , in bed it &apos;s a dutch oven .
what &apos;s a dutch oven ?
what &apos;s a dutch oven ? you fart in bed
with a woman then force her head under the covers .
that &apos;s awesome .
first you gotta be in bed with one .
you &apos;d be surprised .
oh my god ! what ...
yeah .
that &apos;s enough . go upstairs , do your spanish homework .
in 15 minutes .
no , now .
and he goes down looking . the end of the inning .
just got the call .
they put him on a corrections bus this morning .
this was the better move than taking him out .
the man was a legend .
christopher agrees , by the way .
well , that &apos;s nice that he agrees .
but i &apos;m not running a fucking popularity contest .
mommy ! look at me !
