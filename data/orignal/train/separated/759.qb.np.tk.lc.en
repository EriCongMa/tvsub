that &apos;s classic ingorance .
wow , look i &apos;m holding hand in what .
yeah , i want to go out tonight .
ugh , couples !
boo . hiss .
every time you have sex with the same person , jess ,
you die just a little bit .
it &apos;s like a copy of a copy .
but lucky us-- we get to go out looking for some strange .
happy v @-@ day , player !
holla !
look , jess , truth is ,
i don &apos;t go out on valentine &apos;s day .
what ?
there &apos;s no thrill .
you know , all these bars
filled with emotionally vulnerable women .
i &apos;m like a dominican teenager playing little league .
it &apos;s just not fair for everybody else .
it &apos;s my first single valentine &apos;s day in six years ,
and i ... i need to go out , okay ?
we need to go out .
&apos;cause i &apos;m feeling pretty twirly .
twirly ?
twirly .
is that like horny ?
i got the dirty twirls , schmidtty .
watch out ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re about to get laid ... world !
so , we &apos;re doing this--
full @-@ on valentine &apos;s .
what &apos;d you do last year ?
i was fighting with caroline .
what were you fighting about ?
oh , you know , the usual--
about how i make too much money and i dress too fancy
and i &apos;m too good at communicating my feelings .
right .
well , this year we &apos;re gonna make up for it .
you and me are gonna do
a real valentine &apos;s day date .
i know . god , what &apos;s the plan ?
well , first of all , you &apos;re gonna need a map of arizona .
i can get that .
and a container that you &apos;re comfortable getting urine in .
oh , i have one in my purse .
you do ?
no . bad idea .
you can &apos;t go on a first date on valentine &apos;s day , winston .
dude , i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not a first date , man .
we used to hook up all the time .
you know , for two years i had her number
stored in my phone as &quot; shretty , &quot;
&apos;cause i was too drunk to type &quot; shelby . &quot;
she just wanted a relaxed night in .
it sounds kind of sexy .
dude , we &apos;re just trying
to figure each other out , that &apos;s all .
you know where that puts you in six months ?
yeah , watching it &apos;s complicated on dvd
while you cradle your newborn baby to sleep .
and guess what ? it &apos;s not complicated .
it &apos;s about a bunch of rich white people
who are remodeling their kitchen .
are you sure you &apos;re really ready for that ?
dude , it &apos;s gonna be great .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m packing an overnight bag
in case i have one @-@ night sex .
i &apos;ve got a t @-@ shirt , socks ...
is this a sewing kit ?
yes , a sewing kit .
stain remover . hello ?
you don &apos;t have one @-@ night stands--
you get way too attached .
i mean , you could have an emotional connection
with a shoe on the side of the road .
oh , one shoe ? i hate that .
is this schmidt &apos;s idea .
it &apos;s my idea .
i want to try a one @-@ night stand . tonight ...
is all about what little jess wants .
little jess .
okay , all right . i am gonna text kyle
and tell him to meet us at the bar ,
because i &apos;m not leaving you alone like this ...
with all of that .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t know
who &apos;s smelling what tonight .
excuse me ,
you know where julia cleary &apos;s office is ?
uh , does she need to sign for something ?
little late for a package , isn &apos;t it ?
let me guess , your bike broke down .
fixed @-@ gear , single @-@ speed .
i &apos;ve been rocking a three @-@ speed .
no , i &apos;m not a bike messenger .
follow me .
okay .
she can get pretty cranky
when she gets interrupted ,
but i &apos;ll tell you what , i would still hit that .
i mean , despite the age difference ,
i would just take that to pound town .

the point of the story is i looked around at my life and i realized
that i didn &apos;t want to work for somebody else my whole life .
that is exactly how i feel , man .
yeah , but the second half of that story is how
i went broke and started working for somebody else my whole life .

not doing it anymore . i &apos;m not working
all night on valentine &apos;s day .
i &apos;m just gonna get in my car ,
and i &apos;m just gonna drive until i see the sun .

but seriously , tia ,
you don &apos;t want a man who has fancier underpants than you .
i keep trying to tell her that .
it &apos;s true .
you want to have the fanciest drawers in the relationship .
hey , are you gonna be done soon ?
maybe .
she can &apos;t keep eating tacos all night .
yeah .
because i ate most of the tacos yesterday .
you know what ?
i can &apos;t do this .
you &apos;re a really great guy ,
and , um , i @-@ i
i mean , i don &apos;t know that , um ,
but honestly , i was just gonna use you as a giant meat puppet .
i &apos;m looking pretty good right now .
it &apos;s just so hard , you know ?
i feel so alone sometimes .
and i lied to you . i &apos;m not a web creator .
i &apos;m not a player .
i miss her so much .
oh , she &apos;s in ... she &apos;s just in the kitchen .
baby !

i did .
no .
yeah .

and i just want you to know that there &apos;s a photocopy
of my butt somewhere in your recycling bin .
okay .
i had a weird moment , julia , and i went for it .
okay , and if anyone finds it ,
i want them to know that i moved during the copy ,
and i don &apos;t actually have two butt cracks .
i know .

well , i helped him get back together with his ex @-@ girlfriend .
he made me video @-@ chat
with his mom in hawaii for a couple minutes ,
and then , um , i came home , so ...
jess , you don &apos;t your first one @-@ night stand
to be with some total stranger .
you got to pick someone who you know ,
who &apos;s not gonna make a big deal out of the whole thing .
you have an urge , you act on it .
and ...
whatever you do ,
leave immediately afterwards .
god help you if you get sucked into a brunch .
thanks , schmidt .

it &apos;s probably the oil of the ylang @-@ ylang tree .
don &apos;t over think it .
okay .
don &apos;t over think it .
don &apos;t over ...
don &apos;t over think it .
schmidt ?
