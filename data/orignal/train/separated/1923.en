"Go It Alone?"
Surgery is a solo act.
Are you sure you don't want help with that?
I got it.
Come on. Come on.
We step up to the table with a scalpel in our hand,
and we go it alone.
You written your speech yet?
Uh, no. Not yet. Mer and I are going out for drinks tonight,
and she's gonna help me.
The isolation can start to define you.
Because even though you're surrounded by a team...
So...
Vodka is writing your Harper Avery acceptance speech?
Tequila.
what it really comes down to is your training,
your choices, your wits...
your hands, your stitch.
I'm coming.
To Joe's? You're working.
No, to Boston. Tomorrow.
We can make a -- a night of it, you know,
champagne,
room service.
I'm flying out in the morning,
I'm going to the ceremony,
and then flying back on the red-eye.
I'll be gone less than 24 hours.
Cristina, this is the biggest day of your life.
Did you get a haircut?
you're changing the subject.
Yep.
It comes down to just you.
It's been two full weeks of the night shift, Alex.
How long can you keep doing this?
Well, I haven't dropped yet.
Well, when you gonna tell Robbins?
When do I have a chance?
I'm doing surgery 24 hours a day
with a dozen 20-minute naps in between.
You're like a double agent. It's actually pretty sexy.
Hey, Robbins.
Uh, back away, Karev. She's off duty.
Oh. I was gonna say you look nice, but whatever.
Aww, thank you. It's date night.
Yeah, listen, we've been on opposite schedules for weeks,
so if we don't take the time to sit down and eat a meal together
and remember why we chose to be married
we will kill each other.
No sweat.
I've got everything handled.
Enjoy your night.
Thank you.
Thank you so much. You're amazing.
She has no idea how amazing I am.
Well, I hear we have a dog bite over here.
This is Jill and her parents, Kyle and Nicole.
Hi. I'm Dr. Avery.
She says, "It's nice to meet you."
Now, your dog bit you, huh? That doesn't seem very nice.
Jill is deaf, too.
Okay.
Well, luckily, it's not too deep.
And since it's her face, I can go ahead and stitch it right up.
Nothing to worry about.
He says, "Don't worry."
That's good. Right here, okay?
We are not getting rid of the dog.
She was pulling his tail.
He growled to let her know he didn't like it.
I know she can't hear.
Excuse me. Kyle, have you and Nicole considered
a cochlear implant for Jill at all?
Uh, yeah, we've talked about it. We're not interested.
She's the perfect candidate.
She's the right age, she's healthy,
and now is the time where she would get the most benefit.
Yes, I told him "No." It's a "No."
We feel very strongly about that.
Okay.
See? Now you made her yell.
He didn't say anything about her being diseased.
You're overreacting.
Oh, n-no, no. I-I apologize. I'm sorry.
We understand and completely respect your decision.
Let's just get your little girl all stitched up, okay?
This is a common complication of gastric bypass.
The connections
that your previous surgeon created widened,
so your stomach pouch and intestines have stretched out.
So, basically,
it's as if I'd never had the surgery done at all.
Well, Dr. Grey and I are confident we were able to
restore the anatomy of the gastric-bypass procedure
back to the way it was prior to stretching out.
Is anyone here with you?
No. I had my wife drop me off.
She was there the first time,
so I told her she could sit this one out.
I can handle a couple of nights in the hospital on my own.
Well, you won't be alone.
There will be someone here to monitor you throughout the night.
Now, you just get some rest, okay?
Given his co-morbidities,
he's a high risk for post-op complications,
which means one of us
is gonna have to stay here with him tonight.
This is where you offer to do it.
I kind of have plans.
Ah, the all-nighter, Grey.
It's the experience that tests you the most,
teaches you the most.
And when you look back on your career,
you remember it most fondly.
I know that because I did one last Monday night.
That means you're well-rested. Perfect.
Good night.
Kathleen.
Would you find Dr. Shepherd
and ask him to pick up the children at daycare?
I thought we'd take the lead on gene receptors.
We do gene receptors.
Sir?
Gene receptors are our bread and butter.
You tell Claesson that if he --
Even when I understand him, I-I don't understand him.
You pushed Nova Jenkins' hippocampectomy again?
Yeah, I had to.
Uh, I got to take these calls on gdansk time.
You referred three cases to the Cleveland Clinic last week.
This is not okay, Derek. Uh, people come here for you.
You still work here.
You're the one who talked me
into this project in the first place.
Webber tells me that you canceled your lecture.
That's the fourth time you canceled
on the residents this month.
I know that something has to give.
But not surgery, and it can't be teaching either.
I'll handle it.
I've got it handled.
Hello? Dr. Shepherd?
Yeah. Hold on a second.
The lectures will happen
and just put Nova Jenkins' surgery
back on the boards for tonight,
And I'll -- I'll -- I'll handle it.
Okay.
Dr. Shepherd?
Dr. Shepherd? Dr. Grey wanted me to...
remind you to pick up the kids at daycare tonight.
Yes, got it. Got it handled.
Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd? Are you there?
yeah, hi. Sorry.
Hello? Dr. Shepherd?
Braden's bone-marrow extraction went very well,
Um, but he's gonna be in some pain for a while.
Hey, you did great, Braden. We're almost there.
mm. Cool.
Can you explain it to us one more time?
Because it still sounds like you're gonna give our son H.I.V.
N-no. Um, it's gene therapy.
You know, Braden lacks the A.D.A. Enzyme.
Without it, he has no immunity.
So in order to get it into him,
I'm going to deliver it on a fast-replicating virus.
The H.I.V. Virus.
Yes, which will disseminate the enzyme
until it grows on its own.
You want to inject him with H.I.V.?
No, not per se.
For the past two weeks,
I've been working to genetically disable an H.I.V. virus.
Okay, the H.I.V. is...like a hat, okay?
The virus is what matters.
I've taken off the H.I.V. hat,
and I'm gonna make it wear an enzyme hat.
I...I know. It...it sounds counterintuitive and scary.
But I think this is his best shot.
We...we trust you.
Okay.
Hey, we're gonna go, Champ.
You gonna be okay?
He's probably gonna sleep for the rest of the night.
Well, sweet dreams, Bradie-bug.
Hey, dream about replicating genes.
Or...bunnies.
Thank you.
Hey. Why aren't you dressed?
I can't...I can't go.
I have to babysit my bypass patient.
Come on, tomorrow everything changes.
I won't have time to talk to you.
I'll be too busy being better than you.
Good thing it's not gonna go to your head.
Oh, the speech.
Thank people and be funny because people love funny.
There's nothing funny about babies with HLHS.
You're no help to me.
Alex, tonight is your lucky night
because I will go drinking with you.
Can't. Working.
Kepner.
Yeah?
Never mind.
Okay.
Hey, I just wanted to check in before I go.
Kids, Dr. Yang's here. Say hello.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
John bought them these tablets,
and it's destroying their brains.
I'm always the bad guy.
It was a joke, John.
Oh, I'm j...I'm just gonna be gone for 24 hours,
so you can call Dr. Hunt
if you have any questions or problems, okay?
Enjoy it.
Okay.
What?
What did I say now?
Nothing, John.
Don't "Nothing." What?
Nothing.
You get to go every day.
To work.
Still, you get a break.
And then I'm here every night, Sabine, after I work,
Then check on the house, run our errands, do the laundry.
I come here to play with the kids so you can get a break.
You play with the kids? Really?
You hand the tablets, and then you watch sports.
We're basically living in a hospital.
I can't exactly go out and toss a ball around in the backyard.
Mom, Dad.
I have to go. Okay. You can go, Sabine.
You can go anytime I'm here,
But you don't dare because you're the only decent parent.
I never said that.
You never say anything! You jab at me!
You guys, you're giving me a headache.
And then you back away and act like nothing happened.
John, cut it out!
Okay, you guys need to just bring it...
No. Damn it, John. Just go. If you...If you want to, go!
We can't go anywhere!
Okay, Sabine, sit down.
John, you need to leave.
Where am I supposed to...
I don't care, but you need to go right now.
But that's not fair. Karaoke's my thing.
Now, you can't go without me.
Wait. This is a karaoke bar?
It's a regular bar that happens to have karaoke.
How is that different?
It's totally different,
and that's something I know
because karaoke's kind of my thing.
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm also gonna be missing out.
I'm just coming off a 32-hour run.
All I really want is a hot bath and a soft pillow.
Gramps,
how about a glass of warm milk, too?
See? You mock. But actually, that sounds fantastic.
Okay, everybody, get out of your streets and into your scrubs.
I'm gonna teach you everything there is to know
about a hippocampectomy.
But you canceled that lecture.
Yes, I did, and I did you a disservice.
Not only is it a rare procedure,
it's one of the most delicate and elegant
a neurosurgeon can perform,
which you will see later tonight when you scrub in with me.
Tonight?
Unless you have something else better to do
than to cure a young girl of her debilitating seizures,
Dr. Warren.
No.
Hey, Miranda.
Hey, come look at my virus.
Oh, I can't. I...I thought I was going home.
But Shepherd's got us pulling an all-nighter.
Oh. But...
What are you doing?
Watching my virus chill.
That's, That's crazy.
I just removed stem cells from Braden's bone marrow
and injected them into this disabled virus.
I just pulled a 32-hour shift.
You see, I...I should be sleeping, but I'm working.
And you are here and have no work.
You should go home...
And sleep...for me.
I'm just gonna watch.
Go to sleep!
"Boundaries are only there to be pushed.
"I am grateful for the opportunity to have pushed.
I'm also grateful for the recognition."
How's that?
It's nice.
It's kind of braggy.
Well, it's supposed to be braggy.
I'm winning an award. My turn?
Yes, I have very steady hands.
Braggy.
What are you still doing here?
Oh, hey...
Well, a bunch of stuff happened.
Ivy, your head okay?
Yeah, it's just a headache. It's getting better.
John and Sabine had a complete meltdown.
I kicked him out, and she's downstairs getting coffee.
I am trying to distract the kids.
My drinking buddy is stuck at the hospital,
and I still have to write my speech.
So will you help me?
Hey, Frankie. I can't sleep.
Want to play hide-and-seek?
Can I?
15 minutes.
You paged me to listen to your speech?
Maybe.
Oh, come on. You can't be that busy.
There he is. You ought to be ashamed.
Chelsea, don't yell at him.
He's doing his best.
No. Nova, you're sweet.
But you're push over, and you won't say this, so I will.
She's sick, and you keep jerking her around,
Scheduling her surgery, then canceling it,
Scheduling and canceling.
She hasn't eaten in two days
and has had three seizures in the last six hours.
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry it's been so difficult,
but we are going to do the surgery.
When
Tonight.
The O.R. is available at 1:30,
so, technically, it's the morning.
Really?
Really.
Finally?
Well, there you go.
See what a little backbone will get you?
1:30 a.m. That's still hours away.
Well, don't worry, Dr. Warren.
I just got a page from the E.R.
We'll have plenty to do before then.
Come along.
Aww, poor gramps.
I'm fine.
What happened?
His blood pressure is dropping,
and his heart rate is in the 130s.
N.G. tube lavage is clear.
He's got a G.I. bleed,
either from the remnant or the j-j staple line.
Activate the massive-transfusion protocol.
Call the O.R. and let them know we're coming.
Get me a second-year resident.
I'm gonna need extra hands in there.
None of the second years are available.
They're all with Dr. Shepherd.
Dr. Shepherd isn't even in the hospital.
He is. He has surgery scheduled.
Then where the hell are my kids?!
And it's not like I'm insensitive to deaf culture or anything.
I just don't... I don't get how, as parents,
you don't want your kid to experience hearing,
if they could.
Why, you disagree?
They're her parents, Jackson, not us.
Yeah, well, if that was our kid,
she'd be fitted for an implant three years ago.
Really?
Yeah.
Just like that?
What if I... felt differently about it?
Do you?
Yeah.
O-okay.
Don't do that. Don't dismiss how I feel.
My opinion matters.
I am one half of this relationship.
It's my kid, too,
and it's not getting a cochlear implant.
All r--
it's important that we immerse them
in the deaf community,
who consider deafness, by the way,
to be a blessing and not a disability,
instead of just opting for an elective surgery.
I'm sorry. A-a blessing?
What -- what happened?
Ivy spiked a fever,
and she's experiencing some shortness of breath.
Mom, is everything okay?
Not -- not now, honey.
Can I keep playing?
Uh, yeah. Sure, sure. Just stay close.
I'm going to book an O.R.
and do a biopsy right away.
You should call Jon and get him back here.
Why? What's going on? What's wrong?
I think Ivy is rejecting her heart.
This remnant is completely distended.
Try his cell again.
All right, I'm performing a gastrotomy
to remove the intraluminal blood.
Keep transfusing until I get the bleeding controlled.
Suction. Lap pad.
More suction.
Hi, you've reached Dr. Shepherd.
Please leave a message, and I will return your call.
Derek, the daycare is closed,
the babysitters have not heard from you,
and no one is answering at home.
Where are our children, Derek?
Now, a ring fracture almost always causes the dural to tear.
You need to take care not to make it worse.
Murphy, get in here and help her retract.
You need to see where you're going as you extract.
Dr. Shepherd, this man flatlined five minutes ago.
Yeah, that's true,
but this a great opportunity to learn on an actual brain.
It does seem a little strange.
If by "Strange," You mean "Awesome."
Dr. Shepherd.
Yes?
Dr. Grey's in O.R. 3
and needs to speak to you right away.
Right. Okay, where's my phone?
Where did I put my lab coat?
30 seconds.
Just...30 seconds.
Oh, wow, you just spit up all over my pretty dress,
didn't you, Bailey?
Okay, I canceled the reservation.
Shepherd owes us big time.
He said he owes us, right?
Yes. Something about taking Sofia for the weekend
so we could have a getaway, and I'm holding him to it.
Um, Callie, can you hold him? 'cause it's -- it's dribbling.
Yeah. Oh, here.
Hi! Look at that.
Bailey. Yes, hi.
Hello. Yes, hi.
Look at that.
Oh, my gosh.
You forget what it's like to have one this small.
How did we do it before?
Oh, well, we had Mark. God, I miss Mark.
Yeah, I miss him, too. And three's a lot.
Makes me think we should stop after I have this next one.
What do you mean after you have the next one?
Oh, well, I meant "We."
I was just saying "I" 'cause I'm gonna, you know, have it.
Oh. You're gonna have the next one?
I didn't know that we decided that.
I didn't know there was anything to decide.
Amazing.
Fantastic.
Disgusting!
Edwards.
I'm sorry, Dr. Shepherd.
Yeah, don't apologize to me.
Apologize to Mr. Quaid.
I'm sorry, Mr. Quaid.
It's cool.
It's gross -- super-gross.
Hey, doc.
Figure out how you're gonna
get these bastards out of my noggin?
Yes. It will be a, uh, very careful, very precise...
yank.
Oh, me! Me, me, me!
Do I have to do that thing
where I acknowledge the losers?
'Cause I have like five minutes.
I don't want to waste it on people I don't even know.
Mm, it is a courtesy.
You're nervous.
You know, I know you think that I'm too busy,
but I can make it work, if you don't want to be alone.
But I do.
Wait, you think you're gonna lose?
Let me go alone.
I'll update the family.
Come on. Don't be such a weenie.
I'm not being a weenie.
You're kind of being a weenie.
Murphy, the shears have only hit areas
of non-eloquent brain function.
The risk of further damage is minimal.
So go ahead. Pull it out.
Wait.
Okay, vessels intact. Go ahead.
Oh, for god's sake, she's not going anywhere.
Dr. Shepherd, permission to step in.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Okay.
Well, that was a little much.
Way to go, lady hulk.
Get ready for a big bleeder and a crash-dive craniotomy.
In your face!
Not you, Dr. Shepherd.
Um, irrigation.
Nova Jenkins is prepped and ready for surgery.
Okay, great. I've got a little more to do with Mr. Quaid here.
But, guys, go eat and hydrate.
I'll see you in the O.R. in about eight minutes. Hustle.
Derek.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where the hell are my kids?
Don't do that!
Don't walk away from me when I'm in the middle of a sentence.
Can we just go to bed, please?
I can't sleep now, not when you're willfully ignoring
my wishes, my beliefs--
About what? Our fictitious child?
It's irrelevant.
You know how slim the chances are of our kid being deaf?
That is not the point!
What is the point?
You-- you think they're stupid.
You think that they are being bad parents
because they want to raise their kid differently than you would.
Come on. I never said that.
You are judging them!
You think they're ridiculous.
Why are we arguing about this?
Because it means you think I'm ridiculous, too!
Wait a second. What?
Replace "Cochlear implant" with the word "Christening..."
..."bible study..."
"Prayer."
Now tell me this has nothing to do with us.
Come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Jon, where are you?
They just took Ivy up to the O.R.
They think that she's rejecting her heart.
I can't find Frankie. She disappeared.
You just have to get back here.
Call me as soon as you get this.
What do you mean you can't find Frankie?
Oh, do you know where she is?
What?
Watch out.
Well, she usually hides somewhere over here.
Gotcha.
Bam! Gotcha, Frankie!
Wake up.
Wake up. Frankie, wake up!
Wait, hold on, Braden. Back up.
Left, left, left. Hold it.
Back up. Back up.
Right. Right, right.
Hold it. Back up. Ba-- back up.
Oh. Oh, crap.
Frankie!
Do you know where she is?
No, crappy camera couldn't zoom in on a room number.
She's in a linen storage.
Well, which one?
I don't know.
That one.
Pulse is faint.
Let's get her on a bed and on a monitor.
Ivy's biopsy sample's on its way to path.
Frankie's in heart failure.
Karev and I ran an EKG.
It's not her pacemaker.
She needs an LVAD.
Crap. These kids are like surgical dominos.
Okay, let's get her ready.
Karev's prepping her in O.R. 4.
What time's your flight?
It doesn't matter.
Three hours?
For three hours, Derek,
I had no idea where our children were.
I had my hand inside a guy's stomach,
and all I could think was--
I told you I had it handled.
You told me you had them.
I thought I did.
I had a surgery. I had to teach.
Hunt and Webber accused me of dropping the ball.
You dropped this ball.
If you put our kids somewhere, Derek, you have to tell me.
Let's just step back for a second
And take a look that the kids are fine, okay?
I just forgot to make a phone call, okay?
Now I've got a surgery to get to.
No, they're fine.
Zola's asleep and Bailey was out like a light.
No, I don't-- I don't know why Derek didn't tell you.
Yeah.
No, not a problem. Anytime.
Okay. Bye.
I never would have just assumed
you didn't want to carry our child.
You said, "I can't take another loss. It's too hard."
I took that as a "No."
And I was afraid that if I asked you again,
it would make you too sad.
Okay, that was a year ago,
and there was a lot going on, and maybe I changed my mind.
Have you?
I don't know. Maybe.
Arizona, if it would make you happy, it would make me happy.
Yeah, hmm. Y-yeah.
But do you think I should?
Now, with this approach,
we go straight down the barrel to the hippocampus.
Questions?
Stop. Okay, hold it. Here. Let's just slow down.
Here's what we're gonna do-- I'm gonna have each one of you
take a turn next to me at the microscope.
Whoever is at the microscope will ask one question.
Ross, you go first.
Where's gramps?
Who cares?
More microscope time for us.
Good point.
Okay, I think you're blowing this out of proportion.
Am I? Because this is who I am.
At my core, this...this defines me.
And I know that. I love you still.
Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you so much for loving me anyway--
Despite my beliefs, despite my faith,
which I happen to hold above everything else.
You're twisting my words. It's not--
And you're ignoring mine!
You don't accept who I am or what I believe.
You tolerate it. You judge it.
You judge my faith because you don't have any.
I have faith.
I have faith in medicine. I have faith in helping people.
That's not faith!
Faith is believing in what you can't see.
Will you just admit it, Jackson?
You think what I believe is ridiculous.
Yes, because it is! Yes.
Your god is like our hypothetical deaf child, April.
It's not real.
Look, all right, I'm-- I'm s-sorry.
It's n-- it doesn't mean I don't respect you.
It's just...
God, I just feel --
I just feel sorry for you.
You don't know how to believe in something
you can't touch or feel, and that...
is so sad.
So you pity me.
I...I-- I do.
I really do.
We should go to sleep.
Looks like Frankie's LVAD has good flow.
I agree. Passing the cannulas.
Got it. Thioproline.
Start protamine, please.
Alex, you're still here?
Night shift. You're still here?
Yes, we're all still here, obviously.
Did you finish your speech?
Nah, I -- I'm just gonna wing it.
It's weird. They've made their decision.
Your name is typed on a piece of paper in an envelope. I know.
I always figured I'd read about you winning the Harper Avery.
I didn't think I'd be operating with you
the night before you won it.
When is the last time we all pulled an all-nighter together?
Third year?
Oh, god. Look at us now. You've got two kids.
I mean, you're about to win a Harper Avery.
And Alex...
Oh, sad.
Oh, shut up. I got my own stuff.
What stuff?
Oh, lying. Sadder.
A private practice is interested in me,
and I think I'm gonna take it.
A private practice? Is this the butthole guy?
I've been moonlighting over there, taking some shifts,
just to see if I get along with his partner.
Don't tell robbins.
Oh.
And I'm killing it.
And I'm killing it here at night.
I'm killing it 24 hours a day, and I can't tell anyone.
Private practice?
Why in the world would you want that?
Because my fellowship is ending, and it's a crapload of money.
And didn't come from a rich family like you,
and I'm probably not gonna win
a Harper Avery anytime soon.
That's true.
Screw you.
She might.
Might? Screw you.
You don't think this is silly?
No!
Okay, 'cause we're not picking a movie or takeout.
This is -- it's a bigger deal.
Yeah, this feels right.
Okay.
I mean, flipping a coin feels right.
Okay.
It just -- it feels decisive. It's done.
Fine. Fine, fine, fine. Okay, great.
Okay, heads...
I will get pregnant and carry our child,
And tails...
I get pregnant and carry our child.
Okay?
And however it lands...
That's what we do. Right?
All right.
Okay. Right.
No! You know what?! You do it!
I'm sorry.
I don't want to.
I-I-I don't want to.
And you did it last time, and it was so beautiful.
Just -- I don't want to.
I want you to. I want you to.
Is that bad? Am I terrible?
No, you're not terrible.
Will you do it? Please? Okay, wait, now hold on.
Do you want to?
I would love to.
I'll flip you for it.
All three of them are on the transplant list?
I'm afraid so.
Ivy's biopsy results confirm that
she is, in fact, rejecting her heart.
But we are treating her with anti-rejection medication.
Frankie went into heart failure.
I put in an lvad to help her heart function.
We've called UNOS
and put both Ivy and Frankie on the transplant list.
With Link. God.
We started the day with one on the list, but three?
Do you want us to call John for you?
He hasn't picked up the phone once tonight,
and I've already filled his mailbox with voicemails.
They say this breaks couples apart -- sick kids.
And we talked about that, but we didn't think it'd happen to us.
But then we didn't think... any of this would happen --
h-happen to us.
Is this what it looks like?
Is he -- is he gone?
This is when visibility gets difficult.
So why don't we use a self-retaining retractor?
You can't with a keyhole incision.
You risk damaging the anterior choroidal arteries,
which could result in what?
Infarction of the internal capsule
and adjacent basal ganglia.
Edwards, step back.
Wilson...Step up.
Man.
How can we tell if the patient has suffered a pca infarct?
We wouldn't know until after she'd woken up.
Okay, good.
And what symptoms would we look for with a lesion in this area?
Contralateral hemiplegia,
superior quadrantanopia, and amnesia.
Okay, Wilson, you're out. Murphy, you're up.
I was right.
Yes. You were.
But nobody likes a know-it-all.
We have a bleeder.
I need visibility in there, Murphy.
Oh, no, no, no! Not the clamp!
Murphy, what did I say?
I'm sorry. It's just...
It was just instinct. My hand just went there.
Take a step back.
I-I'm sorry. Is she gonna be okay?
Just quiet, please.
Dr. Shepherd -- - I said be quiet!
Do they know where we are?
I was very specific.
I hope this cab doesn't make you miss your flight.
Oh, god.
My bypass patient's in v-fib. I got to --
Go, go, go go. Save a life.
Okay. Good luck.
Okay, thanks.
You know, maybe we should just
call the cab company and make sure --
You know, Owen, it'll be fine.
There's no traffic this early.
I'm not checking a bag. I've got time.
You got to go, too.
No, no. I-I can wait a second.
Mvc pileup on the freeway.
You don't want to ignore that.
I want to see you off.
I'll be gone all of 24 hours.
This isn't some glamorous goodbye.
I'm catching a cab. I know how to send myself off.
You sure?
Owen...
Go, go.
Okay, all right.
So... Knock them dead.
Okay.
Dr. Warren...
We have an on-call room for this.
I heard Dr. Shepherd had you on an all-night surgery.
How did it go?
Crap!
Kids.
Nova, can you hear me?
Why isn't she answering?
Nova?
Nova?
Nova?
Now, if you can understand me, blink.
Nova.
Is...
It...
Okay if I just say "Yes"?
Or is the blinking medically necessary?
That works for me.
I can absolutely blink, too.
It's...really no trouble.
So, everything's good here.
Now, Dr. Murphy will be in charge of your post-op care,
and she will be in every hour to give you a neuro check.
All you have to do right now is just rest.
Sounds good to me.
Okay, good.
Murphy, doctors don't cry in hallways.
We have stairwells for that.
I'm sorry. I'm just so relieved.
Yeah, you got lucky today.
Nothing bad happened,
but it could have.
And if it had... it would have been on you.
So remember the feeling -- that "What if?"
Not the relief.
It'll keep you from making that mistake again.
Yes, sir.
W-what did I miss?
Sabine?
Honey...
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I fell asleep. I was right outside.
I went to sit in the car and cool off,
and I fell asleep, and my phone died,
and I never should have left.
I should have been here with you.
You shouldn't have been alone.
I'm sorry.
I love you. I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know how you do it.
I don't know how you can be a double agent.
I come off of even one all-nighter,
and I feel hollow... jangly.
Do you ever get that -- the hollow janglies?
Alex.
I'm good.
No, we're good on magnetic resonance.
We don't need any more groups on magnetic resonance.
UCLA's got that.
Hey, let me -- let me call you back.
I'm sorry.
I should have called you.
I-I... I dropped the ball.
This ball can't get dropped.
I know.
Nothing catastrophic has happened yet, but it could.
We... we're juggling too much.
Something has to change.
Are you saying it has to be me?
I'm not saying that, Meredith.
I'm just saying that something's got to change.
I know. I know.
I just -- I don't know what to do.
Ohh, neither do I.
But...I do know...
that I need you to take the kids today.
Can you do that for me?
Of course, yes,
And I will update you on our position hourly.
You don't have to do that. I just --
No, but I will.
Okay. All right.
Who's here?
April?
Can I stay here for a little while?
You were right!
I got a good night's sleep. I slept like a log.
Got up this morning.
I made some homemade french toast with bacon --
candied bacon, if you want to know.
I even had time to read the paper.
Now I'm gonna go check on my virus,
which also got a good night's sleep, thanks to you.
And now you can go and get some sleep.
I left your favorite tea on the counter.
Well, a-actually, I managed to squeeze in a power nap,
so I'm feeling all right.
I'm gonna scrub in on a,
uh, shoulder replacement with Torres in a few.
Well, aren't you superman?
Thank you so much.
Excuse me. Dr. Yang?
Dr. Robert Bonocore. Cleveland clinic?
Oh, yes, the epilepsy neurostimulator.
It's -- it's so nice to meet --
I am a big fan -- huge, really.
I have read all of your work on the conduits.
It's just fascinating. Truly.
Thank you. Thank you.
You're Cristina Yang.
Yes.
Where are you with phase two?
We're all waiting to see if we can get our hands on it.
Okay, I understand you're still a cardiothroactic fellow.
Yes.
W-when do you finish up?
I imagine everyone's asking you that.
You must be thrilled to be nominated
so early in your career.
Any relation to Dr. Tara Yang?
She was my roommate at UPenn. She was so funny.
Oh, I -- I'm unfortunately --
Oh, looks like it's time.
Oh. Well, congratulations.
I'll see you in there.
Thank you.
Very nice to meet you.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Cristina?
Mer, I made a mistake. I don't want to be here alone.
You should be here.
And we should be drunk. Why aren't we drunk?
And I want Owen here.
He could, like, you know, hold my purse and tell me things,
and -- oh, my god,
and tell me to wear deodorant.
I forgot to wear deodorant, and now I stink and...
Where are you? Are you at the table?
You know what? Forget it. I'm --
I'm fine.
Surgeons are trained to go it alone,
to be solo artists,
to be mavericks -- both in and out of the O.R.
But the truth is, we are never alone.
What?
Owen.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
I finished my speech. I have it right here.
It took me six hours in a middle seat
with a mini bottle of overpriced tequila,
but it's gracious and not braggy.
I think you'll like it.

of how we are to live and heal and thrive.
The surgeons in this room are redefining medicine
for generations to come.
...For the moment that every surgeon lives for...
And so I am very pleased to announce this year's winner.
