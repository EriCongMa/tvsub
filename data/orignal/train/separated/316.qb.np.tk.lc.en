thank you , everyone ,
for staying late to learn our new ipad order system .
we had no choice , you locked the door from the outside .
either way , we &apos;re learning .
han , why would we update our order system
when our uniforms are from the 1970 &apos;s
and our paycheck is from the 1800s ?
let &apos;s get to the tutorial .
max , you and i are going to role @-@ play .
all right , you can be the little bitch ,
and i &apos;ll be me .
i don &apos;t need this lesson .
i &apos;m very familiar with the touch screen .
let &apos;s just say i put the &quot; goo &quot; in google .
i &apos;m going to pretend i &apos;m a customer ,
and order a hamburger .
hello , miss . i &apos;ll have a hamburger .
certainly , miss .
would you like that with or without salmonella ?
han , i got my first lesson on the ipad from steve jobs ,
and now i &apos;m getting it from han jobs ?
caroline , don &apos;t act like you know more about gadgets than me .
formerly rich doesn &apos;t beat currently asian .
now , come on , everyone look at their ipads .
what ipad ? i didn &apos;t see an ipad
what ? no .
did somebody say something about an ipad ?
what the hell is an ipad ?
where did they all go ?
i &apos;m guessing ebay .
i want them all back , especially mine .
i &apos;m in a casual flirtation with a woman in australia .
she &apos;s part aboriginal , but has a great personality .
here you go , earl .
max , what &apos;s wrong ?
you seem happy .
i &apos;m just still on a high
from this $ 10,000 bank loan i got last week .
and from an almost certainly laced pot brownie i ate in 2004 .
i can &apos;t believe you and caroline got a bank loan
for your cupcake business ,
and not a single hostage was involved .
max , you don &apos;t have $ 10,000 .
you don &apos;t even have netflix .
this money is to pay a factory to make our cupcake t @-@ shirts ,
and i &apos;ve whittled it down to three .
hello .
speaking of whittled .
someone used my printer , and i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s caroline ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s about business
and not another one of earl &apos;s angela bassett collages .
作品如 《 美国恐怖故事 》
what can i say , man ? i &apos;m a bassett hound .
与basset hound巴吉度猎犬仅一个字母只差
oh , thanks , han .
these are the factories i &apos;ve been researching .
we want our t @-@ shirts to be american made .
i have an american maid ,
and all she &apos;s good at is eating my granola bars .
look , max , i found one right here in brooklyn .
&quot; american ace . the founder , ace hardwick ,
is devoted to treating his workers well , &quot;
and not in a creepy way like that american apparel guy .
以及被他囚禁当性奴 但案件最后证实无罪
so you &apos;re saying none of these workers
have ever found an ace in their hole ?
look , i &apos;ve worked in a lot of factories .
i know what goes on .
i worked in a coat factory ,
which is why my lungs are coated in asbestos .
已与多年前由于会致癌而被禁用
i worked in an underwear factory ,
where i was underpaid for the fruits of my looms ,
and worst factory of all ,
the cheesecake factory .
how about we do a walk @-@ through tomorrow
to make sure it &apos;s up to snuff ?
well , if they have snuff ,
why are we waiting till tomorrow ?
hey , everybody !
oh , hey . hi , great news !
i just got carded at buffalo wild wings !
really ? i got carted out of there once .
and more great news :
i &apos;m starting my own new business .
so girls , you know how you have that $ 10,000 ?
well , i don &apos;t want to clean you out ,
but how do you feel about tossing me $ 9,500 ?
you two should invest . sophie &apos;s business is genius .
you know how a bunch of ladies got their down @-@ there @-@ hair
permanently lasered off ?
yeah , that &apos;s when your waxer gives you a michael chiklis .
招牌表情就是一脸不爽的严肃脸
well , sophie &apos;s offering a product
that puts grass back on your field .
that &apos;s not a business . that &apos;s nobody &apos;s business .
yeah , i don &apos;t do any of that stuff .
i just throw a scrunchie on mine and go .
hey , there &apos;s a need for this . sometimes , in the fog ,
my plane gets lost without a landing strip .
we &apos;re out .
oh , don &apos;t decide yet , girls .
you haven &apos;t even heard the cute , little name .
&quot; sophie kuchenksi &apos;s vagina wigs ! &quot;
yeah , we &apos;re really out .
oh . but it &apos;s a quality product ,
and it &apos;s real hair imported from &quot; va @-@ china . &quot;
yeah , never been further out .
and this is our main floor .
wow , this is amazing !
i feel like we &apos;re in the willy wonka factory .
i know , right ?
the american ace motto is &quot; work is fun . &quot;
max was expecting a different kind of factory .
more torture , less foosball .
i know , right ? not at american ace .
and what is your position here , peggy ?
are you the &quot; i know , right ? &quot; person ?
i know , right ?
no , i &apos;m one of the owners .
also , i dye t @-@ shirts .
see , every employee gets a percentage of the company after six months ,
so the longer you stay , the more it grows .
we &apos;ve been at the diner four years ,
and the only thing we &apos;ve seen grow is oleg &apos;s pants .
i know , right ?
well , ace is expecting you . go ahead , go have fun !
hey , don &apos;t be fooled by what &apos;s on the surface .
you look like you have money ,
but i know your underwear &apos;s in shreds .
not shreds , max , shred .
just one , it goes from front to back .
um , hi , should we just come in ? the door is open .
yep , always is .
doors create boundaries . boundaries are a bummer .
you know what else is a bummer ?
tall guys with small penises ?
that you just missed the gelato and designer coffee cart .
espresso hazelnut praline ?
we &apos;re not here for gelato .
we &apos;re not not here for gelato .
awesome . it &apos;s awesome to meet you .
i &apos;m ace hardwick .
look , &quot; ace , &quot;
we &apos;re not about to give you $ 10,000
so you can take advantage of a sad , underage girl worker
near the loading docks &apos; cause her boobs are crazy big
and she needs a ride home .
that &apos;s a &quot; for instance . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry ?
see , ace , max has some trust issues when it comes to factories ,
so , we &apos;re here today to--
you &apos;re pretty much eating cardboard there .
you want me to get you another ?
you should see her with tuna cans .
hey , i see the prosciutto cart .
who wants imported ham ?
me !
well , we &apos;re not not here for prosciutto .
hey , you know what &apos;s cool ?
short guys with big penises ?
you &apos;re fun .
your business belongs here at american ace .
come on , let &apos;s go meet the family .
that guy kind of creeps me out .
on the plus side , i finally get to meet my family .
i had this space designed for open energy
and open conversation .
what &apos;s up , other owners ?
what &apos;s up , ace ?
our sales , by 400 % !
max , this is it . this is our factory .
the employees look happy and successful .
so did the members of &apos; n sync .
but behind the curtain , a veil of tears .
hey , caroline , here &apos;s the prosciutto cart .
thanks , ace !
enjoy . i &apos;m just gonna get a quick five @-@ minute chair massage .
come on , let &apos;s slip out while ace has got his head
stuck in that chair &apos;s ass .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
welcome to american ace . i &apos;m rico .
you &apos;re , like , really , really , really pretty .
so anyways , i &apos;m part owner , and i clean the bathroom .
hmm , quick question : do you have a light cabernet ?
quicker question :
where &apos;s the secret room with the toddler slaves ?
what &apos;s up ? i &apos;m raul , part owner and security guard .
hey , you two want to grab a drink sometime ?
fridays after work , we all hang next door at tortilla flats .
tortilla flat . wasn &apos;t that your stripper name ?
you &apos;re just jealous &apos; cause mine &apos;s taller
and thinks i &apos;m really , really , really pretty .
good luck with that tall guy scenario .
sorry we &apos;re late , but we were busy with our other business ,
the one we care about .
how can i be mad with that sincere , heartfelt apology ?
who wants to see our sample t @-@ shirts ?
i want to see it , but i want to see a lot of things .
with these damn cataracts , the best i can do
is look towards it and get a milky idea .
hey , girls !
i want to show you some of my new styles
for my &quot; everybody &apos;s merkin for the weekend &quot; collection .
sophie , what &apos;s a merkin ?
it &apos;s a vagina wig .
oh , that &apos;s dirty .
and han , i &apos;m gonna need your input ,
because i &apos;m working on an asian line .
shouldn &apos;t han grow some hair on his
before he starts tossing out advice ?
han , i need to know if i got the texture right ,
so come over here .
oh , yeah .
yeah , that feels nice . ohh .
yeah , nice and thick between my fingers .
oh , yeah .
slower .
slower still .
this is like watching your gerbil hump a pencil .
not really sexual , but still grosses you out .
sophie , i @-@ i think you should stop .
i haven &apos;t felt this sensation since third grade
when madam yi checked me for head lice .
remind me to pick up a &quot; what &apos;s happening to my body ? &quot;
book for han tomorrow .
oh , girls , i &apos;ll be over here ,
working on my african / american line .
yeah , i can &apos;t decide whether to call it a &quot; vag @-@ afro &quot;
or a &quot; pube @-@ a gooding , jr . &quot;
max , look . these shirts look amazing .
well , i guess i was wrong about the factory .
like i was wrong about you
making it through that first winter .
look , there &apos;s a note in here .
oh , it &apos;s probably from rico . he &apos;s obsessed with me .
yeah , it &apos;s not from him .
it says , &quot; help us . &quot;
underpaid workers are trapped in that factory , i knew it !
once again , i was fooled by ice cream .
yes , it &apos;s a note that says , &quot; help us , &quot;
but if there &apos;s one thing i learned in business school ,
it &apos;s if you don &apos;t see it , it doesn &apos;t exist .
look , as much as we want to , we can &apos;t just look away .
we need to talk to the workers .
call the guy , the one who thinks you &apos;re pretty .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
i only met a guy who thought
i was really , really , really pretty .
we can meet them at that mexican place .
ooh , a mexican place !
i forgot about the latina market !
girls , when you &apos;re there ,
find out if they &apos;d be interested in some hair south of the border .
didn &apos;t know if you ladies wanted beers or margaritas ,
so we got you beer @-@ garitas .
it &apos;s five bucks , but you &apos;re worth it .
i love a girl with a healthy appetite .
well , you &apos;re gonna be getting down on one knee
before the end of the appetizers .
so let &apos;s just dive right in . how &apos;s factory life treating you ?
give us the skinny-- which is what i hope you said
when you ordered those beer @-@ garitas ,
&apos;cause i cannot be poor with a muffin top .
you know , i don &apos;t want to talk about work .
oh , are you saying you &apos;re not allowed to talk about work ?
your words , we all heard you , rico or raul .
hey , tell me , what do you girls like to do ?
mm , i like to watch waiters make guacamole at my table .
when &apos;s that gonna happen ?
so about work--
yeah , okay .
hey , let &apos;s go see what &apos;s going on in beer @-@ garitaville .
what are we gonna do ? i can &apos;t get any information out of rico .
he &apos;s so preoccupied with
how pretty , pretty , pretty i am .
oh , hi , peggy . how are you ?
would you like to join us and talk about work ?
why don &apos;t we talk about you two skanks
gettin &apos; the hell outta here ?
and i thought we were bad waitresses .
this is carmen . she works at the factory too .
we &apos;re bffs , and she &apos;s one of the owners , like me .
yeah , and she &apos;s a 100 % owner of rico ,
so hands off .
we seen you two sittin &apos; over here
like you &apos;re god &apos;s friggin &apos; gift .
i know , right ? and not for nothing ,
but rico &apos;s pit bull doesn &apos;t like other girls .
i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s his pit bull .
and you , hands off raul .
we have a love that is deep and real ,
and when he finds out about it , it &apos;s gonna be magic .
yup ...
exactly what i expected .
upstairs is willy wonka &apos;s factory ,
and down here , they &apos;re waterboarding oompa loompas .
yo , what &apos;s up ? we just comin &apos; here to work
in the dye room right there as per usual .
yeah , no biggie . what yous twos lookin &apos; at ?
that was a really good accent .
thanks . i played rizzo in grease .
should have been sandy , but i let
but i let the girl with the limp have it .
come on , we have to put these on and go into the dye room ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s where it all goes down .
the dye room , i &apos;m not surprised .
i always knew we &apos;d dye together .
okay , we &apos;ll just pretend to be working here ,
like we do at the diner .
well , well , look who it is ,
stuck @-@ up and stuck @-@ up two : the legend returns .
max , we gotta go .
my life can &apos;t end wearing grey .
what up , ladies ?
last night , you &apos;re hanging with the homies ,
and today , boom , you just happen to be working here .
that &apos;s friggin &apos; convenient .
i know , right ?
very friggin &apos; convenient .
i know , right ?
we just have to show them who &apos;s boss .
you know , like we do with the mouse who lives in our toaster .
so , what , we &apos;re gonna scream and then spray windex at them ?
yo ! see this scar ?
knife fight with five catholic schoolgirls over a slushie .
so unless you want some of what i gave
virginia , stephanie , laquetia , latoya ,
and the one in the wheelchair , i &apos;d stay clear .
this is just a misunderstanding .
rico &apos;s not interested in me .
well , he seemed pretty into you last night .
huh , yeah , but that &apos;s before she talked .
come on , we are not interested in your men at all .
not at all . i mean , come on .
what &apos;s that mean ?
you &apos;re saying something &apos;s wrong with them ?
no , she &apos;s not saying that . it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s just what ?
we &apos;re lovers .
you two are lovers ? &apos; cause you don &apos;t seem--
we don &apos;t seem what ? gay ?
no . hot enough .
well--
not hot at all .
i know , right ?
look busy , keep your eyes open .
i think we &apos;re in the belly of the beast .
you talkin &apos; about me ?
no .
max , what do you think &apos;s behind that locked door ?
i knew it ! toddler slaves .
those kids are in horrible danger
of becoming ... me .
come on , let &apos;s go over there .
what the-- you hit me !
sorry , so sorry . accident !
you throw like a girl .
see , i knew it , you two aren &apos;t gay .

really , really , really pretty .
oh , hell no !
leave my lover alone !
it &apos;s on !
it &apos;s--no , no , no , no , no ! it &apos;s not on .
this is silly . we &apos;re not after anyone .

i used to be rich , i &apos;m dry clean only !
that was a big friggin &apos; mistake !

you two are a lot tougher
than those girls from saint bridget &apos;s .
what &apos;s happening ?
we &apos;re busting you . we know what &apos;s happening here .
what , profit sharing and healthcare ?
we found a note in our box with &quot; help us &quot; scrawled on it .
how do you explain that ?
did you read the back ?
&quot; help us ..
help you ...
to your full potential at american ace . &quot;
we put one in every box we ship .
i have got to start reading more than the first sentence of stuff .
i &apos;m sorry , this is all my fault .
i guess i just wanted to believe
some kids were having a worse childhood than i was .
max , don &apos;t feel bad . you thought someone needed help ,
and you cared , and that makes you a good person ,
and i &apos;m proud of you .
i said i was sorry . you don &apos;t have to be mean .
hey , everybody !
i just got my first shipment of wigs .
sophie , why are you walking like that ?
well , i &apos;m not just the president ,
i &apos;m also a client .
sophie , i think you dropped something ,
unless we have those giant persian roaches again .
even a milky version of that was too much .
you know , max , maybe someday , someone like you will come
into this salmonella factory and rescue us .
what are you writing on those checks ?
&quot; help us . &quot;
we work here . the &quot; help us &quot; is implied .
