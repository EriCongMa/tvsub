nolan ross &apos; secrets are somewhere in that house .
i trusted you .
get out of my house .
you can work when you want .
you can bring carl with you .
or you can keep inhaling sawdust off the floor at mcginty &apos;s .
i can start tonight .
what will you do with all the money coming your way ?
i &apos;ll use it to ensure that the daniel grayson foundation
restores my boy &apos;s good name .
if you go to war with emily ,
no good can come of it .
so move forward for you and your child .
it is for the two of us that i must do this .
jack porter was taken care of .
good .
you know me . i wouldn &apos;t drink and get behind the wheel .
you blew a .14 .
no , no , no ! you &apos;re not taking him !
you &apos;re not taking my kid !
you &apos;re not taking my kid !
daddy !
whoa , whoa ! what &apos;s going on ?
no , no , no ! you &apos;re not taking him !
get your hands off my daughter !
let him go !
let him go ! give him to me !
buddy ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i dozed off for a second .
how &apos;s your breakfast ?
let &apos;s get you out of there .
you miss your daddy , don &apos;t you ?
well , maybe he &apos;ll settle for yours .
carl , look what i have .
what &apos;s that ?
i know .
yeah .
i don &apos;t know how you did it .
well , i had a lot of practice .
his crying keep you up all night ?
that and the thought
of him being taken away from his father .
if jack &apos;s convicted , he &apos;ll face up to five years in prison
because carl was in the car .
jack , uh , he said that he was a little off @-@ kilter recently ,
but he would never do something this reckless , right ?
there you go , buddy . yeah .
he &apos;s being framed .
who would do something like that ?
i don &apos;t know .
margaux &apos;s been coming after me ,
but i can &apos;t imagine her retaliating like that with jack .
tearing a child away from a parent is unforgivable .
whoever &apos;s doing this is gonna pay .
listen , i know this hits close to home ,
but making someone pay ... that &apos;s not the way to deal with it .
it &apos;s the only way .
i am done seeing terrible things happen to my friends .
i &apos;m handling it .
amanda , we ...
i &apos;ll be back after the bail hearing .
thanks for watching him .
hey , carl . you want to play with the cab ?
there you go .
at least someone in this family listens to me .
really , schaefer ? cuffs ?
you &apos;re a familiar face around here , porter .
without them ,
someone might mistake you for a law @-@ abiding civilian .
what is your problem ?
my blood test will prove that i wasn &apos;t drinking .
wrong again .
the lab lost your sample .
they lost my sample ?
i &apos;m being set up , man .
save it for your lawyer .
i don &apos;t have a lawyer !
043 .
mom ?
hi , jack .
what are you doing here ?
emily flew me in last night .
come in .
or should i say &quot; amanda &quot; ?
she told you everything ?
an abridged version .
the full story will have to wait ,
since we have more pressing issues .
a d.u.i. with a child in the car ...
is a felony . i know .
what am i gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna fight it .
but i need to know ... were you drinking ?
i didn &apos;t have a drop .
you have to believe me .
i do .
because i know what it looks like to lie about it ,
which means that we have the truth on our side .
now we just have to find it .
how are you feeling ?
okay . and you ?
i guess congratulations are in order .
oh , you heard about the inheritance .
no , but that &apos;s the dress
we &apos;re putting on the cover of &quot; voulez &apos;s &quot; september issue ,
and it &apos;s only july .
well , it &apos;s a small gift to myself .
but i have another one for you and the baby .
the architect finished your vision .
the daniel grayson research wing .
it &apos;s magnificent , victoria .
countless lives will be saved in his name if it &apos;s approved .
that explains the hospital board meeting on my schedule today .
and the knot in my stomach .
i know that st. joseph &apos;s is in dire need of my donation ,
but the board is still struggling with the idea
of naming it after daniel .
they are , but you &apos;ve made a lot of headway ,
and i assure you that i will sway any remaining naysayers .
thank you .
the groundbreaking will be the perfect moment
to announce your pregnancy .
defining daniel as a philanthropist and a father
is sure to turn the tide .
good morning .
is this your mom ?
i &apos;m the baby &apos;s grandmother .
oh , it &apos;s nice to have you .
are we expecting anyone else ?
it &apos;s just the two of us .
all right , then .
if you relax , i &apos;m gonna tilt you back a bit .
now , if your baby is cooperating ,
we should have an image in just a second .
that &apos;s the heartbeat .
and there &apos;s your baby .
morning .
you startled me .
sorry .
what is all that ?
big daddy &apos;s magic hangover cure --
since lyman was four sheets to the wind last night .
do you know if he &apos;s awake yet ?
no . no idea .
got a call from emily this morning .
jack &apos;s in trouble .
oh , no . i hope it &apos;s not too serious .
yeah , well , that makes two of us .
i @-@ i got to get over there ,
but i will , uh -- i &apos;ll check in later .
ben .
is everything all right ?
hi , nolan .
this is officer tupperman .
we need to speak with your wife .
okay . of course .
uh , louise !
lou @-@ lou ?
come in .
oh , darling , this is very sweet ,
but you know i prefer firemen .
no offense , boys .
ms. ellis , i &apos;m afraid i have some bad news .
a body was found on the beach below these bluffs this morning .
his i.d. confirms that it was your brother .
oh , my god .
not guilty , your honor .
let the record show that the defendant has entered a plea of &quot; not guilty . &quot;
now on to the matter at hand .
mr. easton ?
one cannot put a price on the safety of a child , your honor ,
and we believe that jack porter is a flight risk .
therefore , we recommend bail set at $ 50,000 .
your honor , not only is jack porter a loving father ,
he &apos;s also a decorated law @-@ enforcement officer
with lifelong ties to this very county .
i move that he be released on his own recognizance .
i will never unduly separate a child from their parent .
and because this is his first offense , i &apos;m releasing him .
but , mr. porter , i &apos;m appointing a social worker
to assess your competence as a father .
and i will not hesitate to take custody away
if these proceedings find you unfit .
we &apos;ll start tomorrow at 2 : 00 p.m.
she &apos;s sending a social worker ?
jack , i expected this .
judge knowles is just flexing her muscles
because she &apos;s facing a tough re @-@ election .
we &apos;ll beat this .
margaux , how could you ?
jack could lose carl .
can &apos;t you see that ? have a heart .
that &apos;s close enough .
this is between you and me .
you leave jack out of it .
emily , you started this .
whatever happens to jack is on your hands .
so , you were with your brother
at the 4th of july party last night ?
yes .
lyman had a few too many , so ...
i sent him home to sleep it off , but ...
when i got back , he wasn &apos;t asleep .
what was he doing ?
he was drinking .
he finished off your dalmore .
and i scolded him for being such a bad houseguest
and i sent him to bed .
i figured he passed out .
and did you see lyman after that ?
no .
and now i &apos;ll never see him again .
i know that this is difficult . i &apos;m sorry .
i just have a couple more questions .
i understand you and your brother
had a strained relationship .
we were working to repair it .
ask anyone who saw us at the party .
we were finally getting along .
sure , but i know how it can be with an older brother .
one minute , you &apos;re smiling , the next --
okay , louise did get into a fight last night , but with me .
she wanted her brother to stay . i didn &apos;t .
if anyone had a problem with lyman ellis ,
you are looking at him .
i tell you what . why don &apos;t we wrap up for now ,
pick up again later at the station
when things have calmed down ?
i &apos;m very sorry for your loss .
thank you .
oh . alexander . there you are .
shall i do the honors ?
i &apos;m afraid that would be premature .
your proposal for daniel &apos;s wing was denied .
one member couldn &apos;t see past your son &apos;s ... reputation .
tell me who thought it prudent
to deny a $ 40 @-@ million project with a single vote .
you know the voting &apos;s anonymous , victoria .
and you also knew
that overcoming daniel &apos;s ... situation would be difficult .
even i didn &apos;t make my peace with it
until i realized how many people your generosity will help .
which is why i &apos;d like to help change that one renegade mind .
i &apos;m trying to narrow it down to a few potential members .
do any of these jump out at you ?
what are these names on the bottom ?
honorary members .
they &apos;re not required to participate ,
but i believe one took part today .
is that so ?
she wants to destroy me
so she &apos;s going after my friends to do it --
first with ben , and now ...
this is a far cry from the margaux i knew last year .
she &apos;s angry that we were forced to lie about daniel &apos;s death .
well , whatever her reasons ,
margaux would need someone on the inside to pull this off .
wouldn &apos;t surprise me at all
if schaefer was on the take and he ditched my blood sample .
well , i &apos;ll check his bank account
for any large deposits of euros .
i &apos;m seeing ben tonight .
i &apos;ll try to convince him
to discredit schaefer &apos;s character on the stand .
i &apos;m not sure officer hunter will be much help ,
considering his eyewitness account of jack &apos;s arrest .
&quot; hostile &quot; ?
he said that you got physical
and refused to comply with the officer &apos;s demands .
i can &apos;t believe ben would do this .
i can .
it &apos;s the truth . i was hostile .
i saw them take carl away , and i @-@ i lost it .
all we have to do is focus on debunking the d.u.i. ,
and everything else will fall away .
now , the breathalyzer ... either schaefer rigged it ,
which , from what i &apos;ve seen , he doesn &apos;t have the brains ,
or ...
or someone spiked my o.j.
nolan , do you have the sec ...
security footage of the bar ? already on it .
right there .
he was at the courthouse with margaux .
and look .
my glass clearly moved . he must have slipped something into it .
can we use this in court ?
in support of a theory ,
but i still need material evidence .
well , i have no other camera angles .
then we have to track this guy down
so i can get us what we need .
that &apos;s enough .
what did you put in jack porter &apos;s drink ?
is that really what you want ?
i really want to shoot you in the head
for what you did to my friend .
but i &apos;ll settle for you turning yourself in
and telling them margaux was behind this whole thing .
i can do you one better .
porter &apos;s blood sample .
hard evidence he wasn &apos;t drinking .
hand it over .
whatever you say .
she lives .
latte , chocolate scone , and an apology for last night .
it &apos;s all good . i figured you were working late on jack &apos;s case .
well , something like that .
look in the bag .
what the hell is this ?
you blow off dinner so you could help nolan
make a duplicate of jack &apos;s blood ?
it &apos;s the real sample . i found it on margaux &apos;s guy .
he must have stolen it from the lab
after somebody gave him access .
who ? schaefer ?
i never liked that guy ,
but i doubt he &apos;s capable of this .
i didn &apos;t think that margaux was capable of doing
what she &apos;s doing to jack , but people surprise you .
the seal &apos;s intact , but you &apos;re gonna have a hard time
getting this submitted into evidence .
stevie assured me that she could do it ,
but the sample has to be found in the lab
as if it was misplaced .
emily , i &apos;m days away from making detective .
if i get caught trying to ...
they &apos;re gonna take carl away .
looks like carl &apos;s room has everything except carl .
i &apos;d like to meet him if i could .
where is he ?
oh , he &apos;s spending the day with his grandpa .
as in david clarke ?
the very one .
isn &apos;t it just amazing what he &apos;s been through ?
not exactly the descriptor i &apos;d use
for someone held captive and tortured for two decades .
you &apos;re not concerned leaving carl in his care ?
no . no , not at all .
you wouldn &apos;t be either if you met him .
and where are they right now ?
they &apos;re probably at the park at montauk beach .
probably ?
so , i see here you just started a new job as a bartender .
yeah , uh , south hampton beach club .
the hours are flexible .
they have childcare when i &apos;m working .
so your preferred supervision is at a bar ?
do you or anyone in your family have issues with alcohol ?
i &apos;m a recovering alcoholic , but jack &apos;s never had a problem .
i &apos;m sure it can get overwhelming being a single father .
you must have a drink every now and then .
i know what you &apos;re implying ,
but i assure you i never drive when i do .
look , this ... this whole thing &apos;s
just a horrible misunderstanding .
that &apos;s not for me to decide , mr. porter .
i &apos;d be lying if i said i didn &apos;t have any concerns .
look , carl already lost his mother .
please don &apos;t take his father away from him , too .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
i need a new place to stay .
emily ?
got the jump on me . had to give her the blood sample .
no wonder victoria begged me to give up this fight .
she knows how far emily &apos;s willing to go .
she took him out , too .
lyman left me a message the night he died .
it could lead back to me .
i &apos;ll clear any record of the call .
then that will be your final task .
for your services .
you &apos;re giving up ?
a man is dead because of me .
this is not who i am .
thank you for your loyalty .
i am loyal to the lemarchal name ,
which will lose all credibility
if the heir to its throne is believed to be
the child of a monster .
i ...
your baby , pascal &apos;s grandchild , deserves better .
that &apos;s why you started this , remember ?
i think it &apos;s time we took that step to end this
before she does .
if you &apos;ve done it right ,
the system should be resetting now .
it worked . thanks .
i wonder what tripped it .
have you found anything
connecting schaefer to margaux yet ?
no . nothing .
but does it matter ?
once they see that jack &apos;s blood test
would make joseph smith proud ,
they &apos;ve got to drop the charges , right ?
yeah , well , schaefer &apos;s still an incompetent bully
who went after jack .
of course .
well , you mess with emily , you get the thorns .
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
that you broke into my house ?
well , i walked up from the beach .
i didn &apos;t want to interrupt your call .
well , how kind of you .
now get out .
oh , trust me ... this is the last place i want to be .
daniel gave his life for you in that very spot .
and yet you continue to spit on his grave .
what are you talking about ?
were you the one who voted down
my proposal for the wing in his honor ?
daniel saved my life .
i owe him , which is why i took the time
to vote in favor of your idea .
i &apos;m holding to our truce , victoria .
i don &apos;t want any more loss .
neither do i.
then tell margaux to leave jack and carl alone .
she is doing everything she can to tear that family apart .
oh , margaux .
what &apos;s left of her family is nothing but rubble .
she &apos;s in mourning .
well , she &apos;s got a really screwed @-@ up way
of dealing with it .
take care of her , or i will .
spoken like a true pacificist .
nolan ross ?
depends who &apos;s asking .
tony hughes . i &apos;m a social worker for the state .
wow . good @-@ looking and a good heart .
in that case , yes , i am nolan ross .
and can i interest you in a tour of my club ?
i &apos;m here about jack porter .
oh , of course .
didn &apos;t realize .
what ?
that a full bar isn &apos;t an appropriate place
for a child to spend his nights ?
i &apos;m just trying to help a friend .
by setting up an unlicensed daycare facility ?
you broke the law before he did .
okay , i &apos;ll be on the phone with my lawyers
and i &apos;ll have a license by the end of this meeting .
must be nice to buy your way out of trouble .
it &apos;s a lot nicer than ripping kids away
from their parents for a living .
a mother that tends towards addiction ,
david clarke , and you ...
not exactly the village it takes .
i think i &apos;ve heard all i need to .
and just so you &apos;re clear ,
what i do for a living is protect children .
well , where were you when my father
kicked me out of the house
because he caught me with a boy ?
a lot of kids need protection .
carl porter is not one of them .
i wish my father had cared for me
with the love and devotion that jack has for his son .
so , if you have any other questions ,
you know where to find me .
how would you describe mr. porter
when you pulled him over ?
he seemed anxious , and i smelled alcohol .
so i gave him a breathalyzer .
he blew .14 .
which is considerably above the .08 limit .
thank you .
officer schaefer , the alcohol that you smelled --
sure it was on my client &apos;s breath ?
not exactly . no .
so it could have been from
an eight @-@ hour bartending shift , right ?
i guess so .
but like i said , he seemed very anxious .
most drivers are when they &apos;re pulled over ,
especially when they &apos;ve done nothing wrong .
objection . counsel is testifying .
sustained .
the margin of error for a breathalyzer test is 50 % .
that &apos;s why my client demanded a blood test .
what did the results say ?
the sample vanished .
our lab is overworked , and sometimes things get lost .
and sometimes they are found .
your honor , you and the prosecution are aware
that my client &apos;s blood sample
was discovered by the lab this morning .
i move that it be admitted into evidence and tested .
i will not allow it ,
as the sample has been open to contamination .
the lab assured me that it was merely misplaced
and the protective seal is unbroken .
the lab ...
the lab couldn &apos;t possibly confirm that , your honor .
i agree with mr. easton .
my decision stands .
are we clear ?
no , your honor .
precedent has been set in both the state v. robinson ...
... and v. mendez .
i am warning you , counselor .
all due respect ... - it will not be admitted .
why should the state &apos;s error prejudice my client ?
that is it !
i am holding you in contempt of court .
bailiff , would you please escort ms. grayson to holding ?
it &apos;ll be okay , jack .
mr. porter .
i recommend finding yourself some new representation .
court is adjourned .
thank you .
and now you can take me to my son .
jack &apos;s at home with carl .
david ?
you posted my bail ?
20 years ago , you tried to help get me out of prison .
thought it &apos;s time i returned the favor .
you ready to go ?
one of my greatest regrets is not being capable
of helping you when you were at your lowest
because i was at mine .
i &apos;m sorry i failed you .
you didn &apos;t .
there was so much more to the conspiracy
that neither of us knew about .
the only one that could have saved me was the one who did .
your daughter &apos;s very impressive .
she is .
from everything i heard ,
you &apos;re pretty impressive yourself .
i have to be for jack , but you understand that .
you and i have both been given second chances with our kids .
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s great .
it &apos;s harder than i expected .
can &apos;t make up for those missing years .
emily &apos;s already this full person .
she doesn &apos;t need her dad anymore .
i showed up , but ... too late .
no . it &apos;s never too late .
if i believed that , i never would have met jack .
david , you can &apos;t give up .
emily may not know it now , but she still needs her father .
and you have to be there when she does .
we need to find a way to discredit schaefer &apos;s testimony .
well , i &apos;ve already been through his phone records ,
his bank accounts , and his tax returns .
the only thing dirty about officer schaefer
is his browser history .
then we have to show judge knowles
the surveillance video of james allen at the bar
and hope she changes her mind about my blood .
won &apos;t work .
mind &apos;s already made up .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;ve never been held in contempt .
judge knowles went above and beyond to silence me .
you &apos;re saying that she &apos;s in margaux &apos;s pocket , not schaefer ?
oh , it explains her reaction to exculpatory evidence .
and she &apos;s up for re @-@ election .
do a news search for judge knowles .
yeah , got it .
leanne knowles ... get this ...
was just officially endorsed
by the new york ledger , journal , and tribune .
and a bunch of others .
what &apos;s the connection ?
they &apos;re all lemarchal publications .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s very generous , victoria .
merci .
i &apos;m afraid i went overboard at the boutique today .
i needed some cheering up ...
... after my proposal was voted down .
yes , about that , um ...
it was you who voted against daniel &apos;s wing .
why the sudden change of heart ?
oh , it was not my heart .
it was my child &apos;s .
i heard it beating , and ...
every fiber of my being felt compelled to protect it .
well , that &apos;s your maternal instinct ,
but i still don &apos;t understand .
i realized that announcing my pregnancy
in conjunction with the wing ,
while daniel &apos;s name is still in tatters ,
would cast a shadow over my child &apos;s life
before it &apos;s even begun .
i just want to keep my baby safe .
i understand .
i &apos;m still trying to do the same thing for my baby .
daniel &apos;s heart may no longer beat ,
but my maternal instinct will never let him go .
if you want to keep your pregnancy quiet ,
i will support you .
because your child is his legacy .
then i will support your vision and change my vote .
we may not agree on how to redeem daniel &apos;s name ,
but we want the same thing ...
what is best for his child .
a gift from a secret admirer , your honor .
short @-@ staffed tonight , mr. ross ?
or does the owner always hand @-@ deliver bottles of vino ?
well , he does when it &apos;s the most expensive bottle
in my club &apos;s collection .
you must have made someone very happy .
the question is whom .
well , i will have to check on that for you ,
but , in the meantime , shall i uncork ?
oh , that won &apos;t be necessary .
i &apos;ll stick with my water .
thank you .
evening , judge .
evening .
we got a call from a concerned citizen
that you were weaving as
you were pulling out from the beach club .
you had anything to drink tonight ?
not at all .
yeah , well , just to be safe ,
i &apos;m still gonna need you to take a breathalyzer test .
oh , i &apos;d be happy to .
even though it &apos;s unwarranted
and it could be considered an abuse of power ,
officer , um ... hunter .
just take a deep breath , hum as you blow into the machine .
point 15 .
seems pretty warranted to me .
that &apos;s impossible .
courthouse , huh ?
you better get that .
hello ?
i may be blind ,
but i can see you &apos;re in a bit of a pickle , judge .
who is this ?
you can call me lady justice .
and i &apos;m trying to keep you honest ,
which you haven &apos;t been , have you ?
this is a setup , and it &apos;s poorly done .
i didn &apos;t even have that wine .
oh , but the wine was just a gift .
your water , on the other hand , was laced with acetone ,
a compound commonly found in adhesives ,
like model glue .
but don &apos;t beat yourself up .
i almost missed it myself .
the same chemical that caused
jack porter to fail his breathalyzer test .
this does not bode well for your re @-@ election .
what do you want ?
test his blood .
and when you find no trace of alcohol
but the presence of acetone ,
see that all charges are dropped .
and if i refuse ?
all of the bribes you accepted
in the form of endorsements from lemarchal publications
will be exposed .
and you &apos;ll lose everything , just like you threatened
to take from jack .
the choice is yours .
choose wisely .
i &apos;ll be watching you .
why is it taking so long ? it didn &apos;t work .
no , we don &apos;t know that .
and if it doesn &apos;t ,
i will find another way to fix this .
this is my fault .
no , it &apos;s not .
we did what we had to do to protect ourselves .
margaux &apos;s the one to blame .
it seems judge knowles had a change of heart .
all the charges have been dropped .
oh , thank god ! buddy .
you saved my family , emily .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;ll ever repay you .
how about i start by taking you all out
for a celebratory lunch ?
sounds great .
uh , thanks , but you guys go ahead .
i &apos;ve got something i need to do .
jack .
hey . we need to talk .
can it wait ? i &apos;ve got work to do .
no . it can &apos;t .
you just stopped the porters
from suffering the same horrible fate that we did .
you should be celebrating with them
instead of doing what i think you &apos;re doing .
i told you . i can &apos;t let margaux keep hurting my friends .
i have to ...
punish her for what she did .
and then what ?
and then someone that loves her
comes after you or someone you love
and then on and on until there &apos;s just no one left .
i won &apos;t risk losing you like that , amanda .
i didn &apos;t start all of this .
but you can finish it .
that &apos;s easier said than done .
it always is .
you are capable of so much .
you can end this , amanda .
i believe in you .
thank you kindly .
goodbye .
well , that &apos;s it .
lyman &apos;s body &apos;s on its final trip home .
i &apos;m gonna need something a touch stronger .
god . how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m sorry i haven &apos;t been around much since ...
oh , hush . jack needed you .
and your hard work paid off ... family &apos;s back together .
well , i guess yours will be assembling soon , too .
d @-@ do you want us to fly back to savannah ?
look , i don &apos;t want to see the monster @-@ in @-@ law , either ,
but it is your brother &apos;s funeral , and --
there &apos;s something i need you to know .
i wasn &apos;t honest with the cops .
i didn &apos;t think they would believe me
since it was so close to what happened to daddy .
i was afraid .
that night , when i got back from the party ,
i found lyman here snooping through your black laptop .
what ? !
okay , there &apos;s a lot of sensitive material in there .
what did he see ?
doesn &apos;t much matter now . who &apos;s he gonna tell ?
louise ...
did you ...
no . we were arguing by the bluff .
things got heated .
i didn &apos;t push him , but i didn &apos;t help him .
i &apos;m sorry i wasn &apos;t honest with you from the start .
you are the only person in my life
that doesn &apos;t keep secrets from me ,
and i owe you the same .
i hope you don &apos;t hate me .
i could never hate you .
do you think i should go to ben and tell him the truth ?
no .
changing your story now will only arouse suspicion .
there &apos;s no evidence of foul play , so ...
... you &apos;re safe .
it &apos;s johnny from the club .
he said that the social worker from jack &apos;s case is there .
you should go . jack might need you .
i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
jack &apos;s charges were dropped .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
really , margaux ?
after you stooped so low ,
especially with your own child on the way ?
i admit i was blinded by rage ,
but since the only thing you respond to
is fear and intimidation , i sank to your level
because you &apos;re still preventing my child
from growing up in a world that knows who daniel truly was .
nobody deserves that life .
which is why we have to put a stop to the cycle now .
otherwise , it will continue until everyone we love is gone .
i propose a truce ...
to protect the people we have left .
do you think i &apos;m a fool ?
just the opposite .
i believe you &apos;re a good person , margaux ,
who got caught up in all of this .
we can clear daniel &apos;s name together .
you have my word .
your word is worthless .
not today .
this is my real birth certificate .
it &apos;s the one piece of evidence that can tie me to my identity .
you can use it as a weapon ...
or you can accept it as a peace offering .
you hold all the cards now .
you can choose to end this .
the only way to end this is by you telling the world
the truth of what happened to daniel .
otherwise , this gesture means nothing .
it means that you can trust me when i say
that telling the truth is impossible
without putting more lives at risk .
please , margaux . there are other ways .
no , emily .
there &apos;s only one way , and it &apos;s not yours .
doctor .
what do we have ?
31 @-@ year @-@ old female hit by a taxi .
no signs of head or neck injury .
multiple contusions to the side , shoulder , and lower abdomen .
okay , take her to trauma 2 .
can you tell me your name , miss ?
her name is margaux . she &apos;s nine weeks pregnant .
and who are you ?
her mother .
we &apos;ll take good care of her .
excuse me .
coming through .
it was an accident .
around you , there are no accidents .
the car came out of nowhere .
i w-- i was trying to end this .
get the hell out of my sight .
mr. hughes ?
were you looking for me ?
well , technically , mr. hughes isn &apos;t looking for you .
tony is .
well ... is tony here now ?
i &apos;m tony . what i meant to say is i &apos;m not here on business .
oh , i see .
i came here to apologize .
i &apos;ve seen more than my share of selfish , dishonest people .
it &apos;s made me wary of everyone ,
especially those who are extremely charming .
i ... misjudged you .
what you said about your friend ...
it really moved me .
so , uh ... you didn &apos;t come here just to apologize ,
did you , tony ?
not exactly .
i ... came because ...
i &apos;m ... an idiot .
no . no , no , no . don &apos;t ... don &apos;t be embarrassed .
i @-@ i &apos;m not . i just ... i just saw your wedding ring .
in my line of work ,
we don &apos;t take too kindly to , uh , homewreckers , and ...
no , the ring is ...
is not exactly what it looks like .
ay . but it is a long story .
so ... how about i buy you a drink ?
he was out before &quot; the little engine that could &quot;
even left the station .
he had a big day , just like his daddy .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll sleep just as well .
thanks to you .
oh , i was happy to help . and i didn &apos;t do it alone .
your friends went above and beyond for you .
we &apos;ve been through a lot together recently .
sounds like it . i only got the abridged version .
this whole thing with carl
is just the tip of the iceberg , you know ?
did i scare you off ?
i don &apos;t scare easy , jack .
i &apos;m gonna put the kettle on .
sounds like we have a lot to talk about .
may i come in ?
you gave me quite a scare .
i thought i almost lost you .
not me .
the baby .
he &apos;s gone .
daniel &apos;s gone .
oh , my darling .
i &apos;m so sorry .
dad !
amanda ?
i got your message . what &apos;s wrong ?
i tried ...
i tried to end it , like you said .
it &apos;s too late .
it &apos;s too late .
i ... i ...
it &apos;s okay .
i got you . i got you .
have some water .
how are you feeling ?
margaux , i know this is difficult ,
but talk to me .
tell me what happened .
why was emily with you ?
please .
we only have each other now ,
and i can &apos;t help you if you won &apos;t let me in .
because whatever led to this loss ... our loss ...
requires an explanation .
tell me .
whatever the truth , i will accept it .
emily cornered me on the street .
she said she wanted peace .
she gave me her word .
but then ...
