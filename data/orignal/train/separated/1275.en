*That would be me
*I would be eaten alive
*That would be me*
*I would be eaten alive*
Hey.
Baby, let me buy you a drink.
No, thank you.
Whoa, come on.
Give it to me.
It's mine now.
No!
No one takes anything else from me tonight!
Take it, then, you little bitch!
Now?
No.
I'm so tired, my taste buds are asleep.
What are we eating?
A gluten-free almond cookie.
So it's supposed to taste like cardboard.
Come on, Frankie!
Maura and I put in an 18-hour day.
I want to go home!
Hold on!
Oh, let him impress you.
Okay, she's ready.
What?!
Right?
That looks amazing!
Pop.
Why are you here?
I need a reason to see my family?
We haven't heard from you in over a year.
I'm sorry.
We're gonna need more than that.
Come on, guys. Give him a break.
He just wanted to see the baby.
Really? Well, I don't see the baby.
Do you, Frankie?
I know I should have called,
but, uh, I wanted to surprise you kids.
Great. We love your surprises.
"Surprise!
"I'm leaving your mother!
"Surprise!
I slept with Tommy's girlfriend!"
"Surprise!
"I left all you guys holding the bag
when I stiffed the I.R.S. to the tune of 27,000 bucks!"
All right, all right, you know,
could we not do this in front of people, please?
What pe-- that's Maura!
I'm gonna go make some tea. Excuse me.
I'm here to speak to your mother.
About what?
I'll talk to you when you're not with him.
Then you won't be talking.
How you doing, Frank?
How am I doing? Better before I saw you.
And what are you doing with my wife?
Ex-wife, Frank.
And unless you're here to explain
why you left me holding the bag with the I.R.S.,
I want you to leave!
Pop, w-why don't you just leave, okay?
Where are you staying at?
I-I'm staying at the, uh, Lighthouse motel.
Okay, so, you know, w-we'll talk tomorrow.
"We"? Speak for yourself.
Good night, Frank.
Kids, come inside for a cup of tea.
I'll see you later, Pop.
Yeah.
I-I-I got to go to work, okay?
Y-you work too hard, Jane.
Can you just go to the motel, please?
He has yet to apologize for taking off to Florida
and hooking up with a bunch of bimbos.
Well, apologizing is a major threat to identity and self-esteem
if you're someone who struggles to manage strong emotions.
Body's in the bathroom.
Could be a robbery gone bad.
No sign of a wallet or cellphone.
No I.D.?
No.
Who found her?
Manager.
People have been complaining for a while
that the john was out of order.
So whoever killed her had time to get out of here.
Did you find the weapon?
No. But we got people looking for it.
Okay. Is this the victim's guitar?
I think so.
We're gonna dust the guitar and the case for prints.
Hey, Frost, give me a bag, would you?
Look at this.
Looks like a piece of that stuff they put in gift baskets.
Definitely a guitar player.
She has calluses on her left fingertips.
Look at the velour.
It's indented, like something hard was hidden in the case.
Well, if she brought a guitar,
she was planning on playing.
Did you see the lineup?
Yeah, it's camp fire night at the Argot.
A bunch of female singer-songwriters.
But she doesn't look like anyone on it.
They have an open mike from 10:00 to 10:30.
Penetration wound to the posterior between the fifth intercostal rib
and scapula and anterior
between the fourth and fifth ribs in the cardiac notch.
Can you tell the murder weapon we're looking for?
Not until autopsy.
That'll be after I get some sleep.
Let's get her to the morgue.
Sleep deprivation is as much of an impairment as inebriation.
I do not like to make mistakes.
Can you give me a hint?
Oh, do I have to?
What, do you want this conversation to end and go to bed?
Well, you are looking for something with a sharp tip,
although the wound is not incised laterally.
So, a knife with a pointy tip and dull sides.
I didn't say a knife.
We're looking for an SPT.
Sharp pointy thing.
I am comfortable with that, yes.
Everybody in here has a smartphone.
I'll call Frankie,
get him to look at what's been posted on Instagram,
Vine, Twitter, Snapchat.
Stop, you're making me feel old.
You are old.
Okay. I guess we're done here.
What are you doing here?
I needed to speak to you.
Have you started drinking again?
Yeah. I needed my old friend.
What is it, the back-taxes thing?
What?
I got cancer.
When did you find out?
A few weeks ago.
It's prostate.
How bad?
They don't know yet.
They sent me here for a second opinion at Mass General.
I'm sorry, pop.
Jane, I just want--
Do you have any idea what you did to us,
what you did to ma?
I...look, it's hard for me to open up.
Well, try.
You put your family through hell,
and I for one would like to know why.
You were a good dad.
We were a-a good family. We had good times, right?
Yes, we did.
So, why -- why would you sleep with Lydia?
Why would you do that to ma and then just take off like that?
Look, I loved your mother for a long time.
And when you kids were home and the business was good,
we were happy.
But then you guys grew up and left.
Business went bad, and there was just me and her.
I was just so unhappy, Janie.
So you're only back because you need us.
I was hoping that you need me, too.
Look, Jane,
would you tell your mother about the cancer?
I need her, too.
And I know if it comes from you, she won't turn me down.
Pop, I can't.
I'll be here for you, okay?
But...you got to ask her for forgiveness
before you can ask her for help.
Oh, Jane. Come on in.
Can I get you some tea?
Uh, no, thanks.
Why did he tell me?
Why do I always have to be the oldest?
Prostate cancer is one of the most survivable cancers
if it doesn't spread.
Do you know what stage it's in?
He didn't know.
I had to stop him
when he started worrying about his manhood.
Well, the good news is that 40% to 60% of men
who were able to have erections before surgery
are able to after.
Please, spare me that good news.
Are there any visible symptoms of prostate cancer?
You know, like a prostate limp or something?
No, Jane. Why?
It just...I'm not really sure I believe he has cancer.
Why would he lie?
I don't know -- to get sympathy, maybe.
That's why he came back?
He's sick, isn't he?
And he wanted you to tell me, didn't he?
Ma, he -- he told me
because he's afraid to tell you.
He should be.
What does he have?
He has cancer, ma.
Prostate cancer.
I see.
Okay.
I'll deal with him.
And I'll tell your brothers.
You go home. You get some sleep, okay?
I'm sorry to dump this on you, ma.
You didn't, baby. You didn't. He did.
Thanks, ma.
Where are we on the case?
We I.D.'d the victim with her prints.
She was 21,
a student at the Massachusetts Music Conservatory.
Natasha Osmanski.
Why were her prints on file?
She was booked on a D.U.I. charge six weeks ago.
It's still pending.
Did you notify her parents?
Told them early this morning. It was rough.
They're coming in later. Dad's apparently famous.
Apparently? It's Alexi Osmanski.
I know him. He was left wing for the Bruins.
Actually, he's a very famous composer and conductor.
All right, what about her stolen wallet,
and has anybody used her credit cards?
Not yet. Flagged them all.
Anybody post any photos online of our victim?
Tons of postings, but I haven't seen any photos of her yet.
I'll keep checking.
She doesn't have a Facebook page.
Even I have a Facebook page.
With three friends.
I'll be your friend.
You already are.
All right, Maura's doing the autopsy.
Uh, call me when the parents get here, okay?
Stomach contents -- smell them.
Ooh. You know my policy.
Unless that bile stew
can help me track her movements before she was stabbed,
I do not sniff.
I just thought you would recognize vanilla.
What, she had a drink with vanilla in it?
I don't know if it was a drink,
but her blood-alcohol level was 0.06.
So that's one or two drinks for a girl her size.
What about her tox screen?
Clean for common prescription and street drugs.
Okay, talk to me about the murder weapon.
Still unclear, but I did check the, uh, toolmark database.
There are hundreds of possibilities --
knives, daggers,
letter openers, nail clippers, and bayonets,
stilettos.
Stiletto shoes?
Yes, and stiletto blades.
Maura, you were supposed to narrow it down
and not tell me
we'still looking for a sharp pointy thing.
What's with the black stuff on the swab?
Oh, I found when I swabbed the posterior entry wound.
I was just about to give it to the crime lab.
You didn't sleep, did you?
No, not much.
Cavanaugh knows.
Well, of course he does.
He and your mother are a couple.
I mean, it's not like
I want my parents to get back together, but...
you don't think it's icky that my boss is...
sleeping with my mother?
No. But I-I can see why you do.
You're never old enough to hear the details
of your mother's sex life.
Ma just told Tommy and Frankie she needs moral support.
Got a hit on the victim's credit card.
Guy was using it right down the street at a 7-eleven.
They've taken him to interrogation.
Great. Let's go talk to him.
Uh, Jane. What about your mother?
I have an interrogation to do.
No.
No?
You can't, Jane.
Go take care of your mother.
But he's a suspect, Vince.
And Frost and I can handle him.
Where'd you get that shiner?
What shiner?
I'm guessing it happened
when you took Natasha Smanski's wallet.
Who?
More like, "What?"
Dumb move to leave it in your glove compartment, Wayne.
No idea how it got there.
This isn't a picture of you using her credit card?
It sure looks like you.
Hey, man, she gave me that card.
Oh, now she gave it to you.
Was that right before you murdered her?
You two be tripping.
We were talking. She was into me.
She gave me that card to buy us some drinks.
When I came back, she was gone.
We checked.
Her card was not used at that bar.
So...
are you ready to stop wasting our time here?
Okay, I took it.
All right?
But that bitch was crazy.
Before or after you stabbed her?
I didn't stab her. I was just playing around.
But she started freaking out.
"No one else is taking anything from me tonight!"
Maybe because you took her wallet.
No, that was after she hauled off
and hit me with her guitar case, dude.
So you followed her to the ladies' room,
and you stabbed her.
No.
All right, the wallet was on the floor,
so, yeah, I kept it.
A little payback for smashing my face.
I'm the victim here.
Take off your clothes, Wayne.
Oh, I don't swing that way, boys.
Now you "Be tripping," Dude.
We're looking for Natasha's blood on your clothes.
Strip.
I don't need to watch this.
I've seen it before.
Hey! You can't do this!
Oh, hey, sorry, forgot to mention.
You're under arrest --
for larceny and forgery.
Now take off your clothes.
It's gonna be okay, right, Jane?
I don't know, Tommy.
Let's get all the information first, okay?
Yeah, you know, we can't control the cancer,
so let's just help ma.
And if she wants to be there for him,
whether he deserves it or not,
then we be there for ma.
What are you doing here?
I'm taking your father
to his oncology appointment.
Your mother's been a godsend.
That's too bad you just figured that out.
You're wrecking it. Would you stop?
Will you stop, Tommy?
Listen, I know I don't deserve your forgiveness.
All I'm asking for is one last family dinner
before it's too late.
Please.
Okay, fine.
We'll do it at Maura's tonight, okay?
Ma, you can't ask Maura to do that.
Let's do it at Mario's. You know, just us family.
Family?
Maura is family.
She took me in when I had no place to live
after you left me.
And you want our support?
Well, it has to be done my way with my family.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, let's go to the doctor.
Call me when you're done, okay?
Yeah, listen, I was wondering.
Can you just...?
Damn it.
Well, what's the matter?
We can't tie the guy who took our victim's credit cards
to her murder, so we can only charge him with larceny.
I was wondering if you kids want to come
to the doctor with me.
Yeah, pop. Y-yeah.
Frankie and I got to get back to work, pop. Sorry.
Back to work.
Okay. Sure.
Come on.
We should go with them.
Yeah, we should.
I have results.
Dr. Isles, you seen Jane?
Uh, she just texted me. She's looking for angela.
What happened with Frank?
I don't know.
She said to get started without her.
So, the black, gritty substance I found in the wound
was transferred from the weapon.
It's keratin hydrolysates, acetate nitrocellulose,
and zinc sulfide.
I hear "Fingernails" in there.
Was the rest of it nail polish?
Black nail polish -- very good.
So the killer was a woman.
You might want to update the era you're living in.
Guys wear nail polish now.
Some guys.
So what's the weapon? A nail file?
Possibly.
A steel eight-inch nail file
is consistent with the wound tracks.
Sounds like a crime of opportunity.
Girl in a bar goes to the ladies' room.
She's attacked and stabbed to death
with what could have been a nail file.
Only real motive we have
is she had something in her guitar case the killer wanted.
I wish I could tell you what made that indentation.
All I know for sure was that it was a hard cylinder,
roughly 10 inches tall with a 5-inch circumference.
Could be a lot of things.
What about stomach contents?
Mostly bile,
but we were able to identify althea officinalis.
Marshmallow root.
That bar serve marshmallow root?
They don't serve much.
No, I'm not seeing anything with marshmallows in it.
So she was somewhere else before the bar.
You know, althea officinalis is also an herbal remedy
for gastrointestinal distress,
Colitis, and urinary-tract infection.
Did she have any of those...issues?
I have ordered her medical records.
And they are on their way.
You want to talk?
Is it bad, ma?
It looks bad, honey.
Victim's parents are here.
Your daughter was adopted, then?
Yes.
There were so many unwanted babies in Russia.
We fell in love with her.
We didn't know it would be so hard for her --
for us.
Like many orphans,
Natasha had an attachment disorder.
By the time she was 3,
Alexi realized she was a music prodigy.
One time she was on my lap,
and I missed a chord.
And she says, "You missed one, papa."
And she plays "E" major for me.
Perfectly.
And she continued to play piano?
Uh, yes, yes.
She was, uh, awarded a scholarship.
At the massachusetts conservatory of music.
That's very prestigious.
When did she add guitar?
Guitar?
She didn't play guitar.
Did you know your daughter had been arrested
for driving under the influence?
Yes.
It was my fault she drank.
I push her.
No, we -- we both did.
She was so shy.
I-I think she drank because she was terrified to perform.
Her, uh, doctor suggested
she enter an addiction-treatment program.
That's where she's been for the past month.
Stanza rehab center. She was there yesterday?
That's what we thought,
but apparently they were allowing her to leave.
Did she have a cellphone or a computer in rehab?
Uh, we kept her phone. Stanza didn't allow it.
And she wasn't allowed use of the internet, either.
But she had a computer?
For school work, yes.
Did Natasha have a boyfriend?
No.
How about friends?
She was never good at making friends.
I-I can't imagine her going to a bar.
She brought a guitar to the bar. Why would she do that?
It doesn't make sense. She didn't play.
She wouldn't go to a bar.
But she was there, Alexi.
Oh, god, how did we get it so wrong?
We are both so sorry for your loss.
What the hell?
"I cannot confirm or deny."
"I cannot confirm or deny."
Stanza rehab won't even confirm Natasha was a patient.
We're gonna need a warrant to get her records.
I've been going through her wallet.
She had a Boston city all-transit pass.
Victim had a b-cat pass?
Everything okay?
No. But thanks for asking.
Okay, uh, did you trace the pass?
Yeah, it's just coming up.
Okay, this is weird.
She only took the green line,
And she only got on and off at one station -- Symphony.
She rode around in circles?
Maybe she never left the station.
Yeah, there are a lot of buskers in that subway station.
What the hell is a busker?
It's a street performer.
I hear the good ones can make like 700 bucks a day.
We are in the wrong line of work.
Hey, you need to have a talent.
I got talent.
One that people will pay to see.
B-cat transit makes you register with them
and issues a performer permit and I.D. badge, don't they?
Yeah. I'll check to see if she had a permit.
Her mom said she was terrified of performing, though.
Apparently that's what began the drinking.
Nope, she wasn't registered.
Hey, maybe we need to check out "American idol."
That's where kids go to get discovered nowadays, right?
No, man.
You blog and post and try to get yourself
on one of the big music sites, like Pitchfork.
Pitchfork? What kind of name is that?
A review on that blog
is like making the cover of rolling stonin your day.
Her parents said she didn't play guitar.
Those calluses on her fingers say different.
Doesn't play guitar, doesn't drink,
And yet we find her dead in a bar
with alcohol in her system and with a guitar.
Yeah, on a night with a half-hour of open mike
for female singer-songwriters.
She was there to sing.
Odds are she was in symphony station to sing, too.
Maybe our shy, friendless classical musician
was leading a double life.
Frost, can you do a search
to see if she posted anything with her singing?
No, nothing using her name.
I'm gonna try "Girl,
Symphony station, guitar."
Yeah, here's something somebody else posted.
Let's see what it is.
Wow, what a voice.
Yeah, she's the real deal.
Nice lyrics.
Hey, bitch, that's my spot!
Hey, leave her alone!
Hey, mind your own business!
And don't let me catch you here again!
This is my spot!
I'm so sorry.
We need to find that guy.
Hey, Delroy, you got a minute?
The name's Busta Bucket.
Put some money in, and I might talk to you.
I thought your name was Delroy.
Yeah. Delroy King?
You did 10 years at Walpole for manslaughter.
You Five-O?
I'm cool. I got my performance license.
Which is for inside the subway at your assigned spot,
not out here on the public street.
How come you left your spot down below?
Come on, man. This is hard work. It's hot down there.
Where were you last night from 9:00 to 10:00?
With my old lady, banging a different kind of drum.
Yeah.
You know this girl?
No.
Mind your own business!
And don't let me catch you here again!
This is my spot!
She came back, didn't she?
That's why you followed her and stabbed her.
Hell, no! I didn't stab her!
I tried to scare her off, but...the girl could sing.
So I let her work my spot,
And she gave me some of the money.
Well, she's dead now, Delroy.
I didn't touch that girl!
All right, pack up your buckets.
What? Nah, I can't leave my station.
Yeah, you can. You're gonna come down to our station
till we can check out your story.
Let's go.
Oh, is this the crinkled paper I found in her guitar case?
You know, the crime lab
found traces of cacao-bean extract on it.
Chocolate?
Yeah.
Where was she between rehab and the bar?
And what was she hiding in the guitar case?
What about Mr. Bucket?
Dead end. Busta's alibi checks out.
He was with his old lady.
The neighbors saw him come home.
What if this is just some random killing that we can't solve?
Don't say that.
Well, I mean,there are a lot of homicide departments
that have piles of unsolved cases like this one.
Why are you talking like this?
My father's PSA numbers came back,
and they're through the roof.
It's not a-a very reliable test.
Numbers can rise with a routine prostate examination
or even digital stimulation during sexual experimentation.
Maura, stop.
Have they done his ultrasound yet?
It's tomorrow.
You want to come over for dinner?
Crap, I was gonna ask you the same thing.
What does that mean?
I'm so sorry.
Tuna casserole.
Vienna sausage wrapped in bacon with water chestnuts.
Jello mold, Boston cream pie.
Um, where are the vegetables?
Right here. Canned corn.
Frank's favorite. We'll eat extra kale tomorrow.
How hard is it to remember where the fork goes?
I'll show you where the fork goes.
Boys, knock it off!
Our guests are gonna be here any minute.
Wait. Guests, plural?
I'll get it.
Hey, pop.
Hey. How you doing?
All right.
How's my boy? All right?
I'm good.
Hi, Frank.
Nice flowers, huh, ma?
Yeah. Thanks.
Blue carnations?
They're actually white.
But dip them in blue dye,
with capillary action, you get that.
Listen, I don't think this is a good idea tonight.
Well, it's one bottle for six people.
It's all right. Come on.
It's okay.
Who's that?
I told you we're gonna do things my way.
Hi, honey.
Thank you.
Well, uh, we certainly have an interesting case
that we're working on, don't we, Jane?
Yeah. Uh...yeah, why don't you tell them about it?
Um, well, it's tragic, really.
I'll say.
The case.
I mean, the victim.
She was a child prodigy.
I was a prodigy.
I could skate backwards when I was 3.
That was me skating backwards holding you up.
You were no prodigy.
He -- he was like an idiot savant.
But that was because of the way he could play chess.
Useless at everything else.
Tommy did a lot of things well, pop.
And Frankie here -- see this kid?
This kid had a million-dollar arm.
I thought you'd be playing for the Red Sox.
Me too.
He kept whining about his sore elbow.
Want to know why? You know what coach Tony said?
Tommy, don't waste your breath.
No, I'm gonna say it.
You made him throw so many curve balls, he threw his arm out.
Nah. He was a quitter!
And you. Be honest, you babied him.
Frank, you know what alcohol does to your tongue.
Don't embarrass me here.
It's okay. I'm sober.
I'm sober, too, Frank.
It's okay, pop.
We all know what alcohol does to you.
Yeah, and for the record, uh, Frankie is a great detective.
And Tommy is a great father.
You know, on that note, I got to go see my kid.
Yeah. I'm gonna get out of here, too.
Thanks for dinner, ma.
Hey. Hey, I...
Hey, I was just busting balls.
I'm just kidding!
Where you going?!
I'm busting balls!
I think I should go, too.
I'll walk you out.
No, let him go!
I want to talk to my wife.
But she's not your wife no more, Frank.
And you're gonna show some respect starting now.
Yeah, come on. You gonna make me?!
No, no! Come on. Stop it!
Stop it! Pop, stop!
Let me take you to the motel, okay?
Take a look at yourself Frank.
Okay? Come on. Come on.
Come on. Let's go to the motel.
Just like I thought. You're a coward.
That's it, Frank
No, stop it! Stop. Sean.
Go ahead, hurt Angela again.
It won't be the prostate that kills you, Frank.
Sean, come on--
Please, daddy. Please.
Just get him out of here! Just stop!
I'm sorry.
You know, all that crap that you say to Tommy and Frankie --
You can't ever take that back, pop!
I'm sorry, Maura.
Coffee?
Danish?
What's the occasion?
We just want you to know we care.
Thank you.
My dad's an asshole, too.
Okay, well, let's get back to work
so I don't spend the day in the fetal position.
Frost, you said
the creep that stole Natasha's credit card
said she was upset
about having other things taken?
Yeah.
He said she said something about,
"Nobody else is taking anything from me tonight."
Could she have meant something other than her purse?
Well, now we're talking.
We just got a warrant
to dig through Natasha's stay at Stanza.
Let's take a ride to rehab.
I'm not happy to be presented with a warrant with such a broad scope.
It's one thing to invade Natasha's privacy.
This is a homicide investigation.
But Natasha wasn't killed here.
Check the visitors log.
She signed out at 7:35 P.M.
Thank you. I think we will.
If you don't allow cellphones or access to the internet here,
why would you allow your patients
to come and go at their own will?
We provide structure here, but we also provide freedom.
It's not a prison.
Are Natasha's things still in her room?
Yes.
Oh, I got her computer.
This doesn't get played much.
Does that mean something?
I don't think it's Natasha's guitar.
Her action was set up perfectly.
This one, the action's wrong. It's high, uneven.
Holy crap.
Where'd you learn to play like that?
I taught myself.
You could make real money on the subway.
Then I wouldn't get to look at you all day long.
Um, did Natasha have a roommate?
Kelsey's in the music room.
She's leading Natasha's memorial service.
*I found my rose in a hungry soul*
*And I've seen troubles that no one should know*
*And I've got scars and marks I can show*
*To remind me*
It's the same song Natasha was singing in the subway.
Natasha had a much better voice, though.
*And I'm not out for blood, you see*
I'm having trouble believing she's gone.
Was there anyone here who had a problem with her?
Anyone that she didn't like?
God, no.
I can't imagine anyone hurting her.
She was like a kitten or a puppy.
She barely talked.
How was she doing in rehab?
Okay, I guess.
She said she liked music therapy
as long as she didn't have to play in front of people.
Play piano or guitar?
Or both?
She only played piano.
But she had a guitar.
Yeah, but I never heard her play it.
So you didn't know she was performing in the subway?
I-in public? Natasha? No way.
That's why she wanted to leave the conservatory.
I wonder how her parents felt about that.
She said they flipped.
The conservatory's all about performance.
By senior year, that's all you do.
Natasha couldn't perform unless she was loaded.
I'm guessing she was trying to decide
between sobriety and performing.
According to Stanza's visitors log,
the only people who ever visited her were her parents.
So I'm just wondering who did this.
Did what?
Some of the files on Natasha's hard drive have been wiped.
Actually, it's a lot of them.
Can you get it back?
No.
And it wasn't password-protected.
Anybody could have done it.
I can't tell when, either.
I went through Natasha's medical records at Stanza.
There's nothing to indicate
she was taking any kind of marshmallow-root supplement.
Then how did that get in her stomach?
You know, I'll check again
to see if there are any other uses for althea officinalis.
Frost, you're sure the bar didn't sell any food or drinks
that has marshmallow root in it?
Yeah.
Maybe somebody gave her a supplement?
Well, that's interesting.
What? What did you find?
It's speculation.
It's homicide. We speculate up here.
Well, that's the flower for althea officinalis.
That's the marshmallow-root flower.
On the bottle of mallow vodka.
Which means there's marshmallow root in it.
It doesn't list the ingredients.
It doesn't have to.
Look at the shape of the indentation.
That's what Natasha had with her.
Liquid courage. She was gonna sing that night.
But why would the killer take the bottle?
I've been looking at Natasha's homework.
She was supposed to be composing classical symphonies.
But she's writing something else here.
That's the song that Natasha was singing in the subway.
What, you think she composed it?
Maybe. But why hide it?
Maybe because her classical-musician father
didn't approve of indie rock.
Natasha's roommate, Kelsey,
got a gift basket delivered at 7:00 p.m.
Natasha signed for it.
That's how the vodka got in.
That rehab place doesn't check deliveries.
Barbara said Natasha left the rehab facility at 7:35,
right after that gift basket was delivered.
The crinkle-cut paper had chocolate on it.
Yeah, and what would you put in a gift basket
that you were giving to someone
who was performing on camp fire night?
The ingredients for smores.
Yeah, chocolates and marshmallow vodka.
That's what Natasha had in her guitar case,
and that's why the killer took the bottle.
*No one else can make all our wrongs right*
*And then you said*
*We must pay for our own blundes*
*We must pay for our delights*
It sounds better when Natasha sings it, doesn't it?
I'm -- I'm rehearsing. I've got a show.
Your shy roommate didn't know how valuable her songs were,
but you did, didn't you?
Natasha told you she was gonna take that microphone
and sing her own song
in front of the record company that signed you.
Broad Sound Records wanted to hear their new star.
Because it's my song.
That's why Broad Sound Records signed me.
When did you write it?
About a month ago.
How did you do that?
It was posted on YouTube six months ago.
You don't even play that, do you?
That's just a prop. You're no singer-songwriter.
When you couldn't get your music career going,
you started to drink.
Rehab turned out to be just the break you needed.
Too bad about that damn gift basket.
There it was on the card for Natasha to read.
What did it say -- "Congrats on your new hit.
See you at the Argot"?
Natasha stole my gift basket so she could get drunk.
She was already unstable.
She showed up here angry and out of control.
She showed up to sing.
And when Broad Sound
heard her voice and her story --
that you'd stolen her music and her lyrics --
your new career was over.
Nice black nail polish. It's a new coat?
We need a sample to see if it matches the stuff
we found in Natasha's stab wounds.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
They all kept telling me,
no, they wanted singer-songwriters,
so I took some of her songs.
I recorded them, and I put them up.
They went viral, and then it spun out of control.
You're under arrest for the murder of Natasha Osmanski.
What are you doing here?
He came here to tell you something... himself.
I came here to apologize... to you, Jane.
And you, Maura.
I was a pig last night.
Don't blame it on the wine, pop.
I said some terrible things.
I screwed up. I'm sorry.
Well, thank you for apologizing.
That must be hard for you.
It is.
It always has been.
But I got some good news.
I do have cancer, but they said it was... stage II.
That's very treatable.
I'm glad to hear that.
I want you to forgive me, Jane.
Please.
You're my number-one daughter.
I'm your only daughter, pop.
Okay, so, now what?
I'm thinking about moving back to Boston.
You have a new life in Florida, Frank.
I have a new life here.
What are you saying, Ang?
I'm saying...
you're not my husband anymore.
You'll always be our children's father.
And I'll be here if you need me.
But you should go back.
Jane?
No, stay in touch, pop.
It's a short flight. Come back anytime.
Okay.
You take care of yourself, Angela.
You too, Frank.
Goodbye, my sweet big girl.
I love you, daddy.
I love you, too.
All right.
Okay.
So...
Now that we're all good and depressed,
what should we do?
I have some jello from last night.
Nobody ate it.
Well, that's a shock.
I have some cookies.
The ones that taste like cardboard?
The night just gets better and better!
Oh, good, well, I'm glad I saved some for you.
I'm really proud of the way you handled yourself, Ma.
I'm proud of you, Jane...
And your brothers --
that's who I'm proud of.
And thanks for putting up with us nut balls, Maura.
What do you mean, putting up with you?
You're my nut balls! You're my family.
