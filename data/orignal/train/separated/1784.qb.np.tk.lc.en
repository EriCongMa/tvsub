i didn &apos;t understand your e @-@ mail .
uh , can you repeat that ? you &apos;re breaking up .
i didn &apos;t understand your e @-@ mail .
ah . yeah , i had to get a little creative
because the s , r and m keys on my laptop stopped working .
&quot; deaw aby , could you pleathe dwive be
原句是 &quot; 明天有空载我去火车玩具店吗 &quot;
to the twain thtowe thubtibe tobowow ? &quot;
so , is that a yes ?
sheldon , why don &apos;t you get a new computer ?
you know that one &apos;s out @-@ of @-@ date .
oh , but i like this computer .
the video is failing , and the sound is cutting out .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t get that .
the video is failing ,
and the sound is cutting out .
i &apos;m sorry , one more time . the sound is cutting out .
i can &apos;t read that !
the video is failing !
get a new computer .
what ?
get a new computer .
what ? !
hello ?
get a new computer !
this is cool .
when was the last time you and i built something together ?
scientifically ? a little over a year ago .
legos ? last week in my room .
if there was a nobel prize for millennium falcons
that fall apart when you pick them up , we &apos;d be set .
hey , guys !
what are you doing here ?
we heard there were some sexy scientists
working hard all weekend .
yeah ,
so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for &apos; em .
soup , sandwiches and emasculation ,
just like my mom used to make .
so , how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
good . slow .
there &apos;s a lot of tedious setup , but once we get through that
it should go quicker .
is there anything we can do to help ?
you know what , this part isn &apos;t that technical .
you actually could .
wow , really ? called my bluff . all righty then .
can we really help ?
while we finish soldering these boards , it &apos;d be great
if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with teflon tape .
i &apos;ll show you how to do one .
hey , w @-@ wouldn &apos;t it be funny
if after all your years of hard work ,
i &apos;m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough ?
he doesn &apos;t think that &apos;s funny .
i got here as quickly as i could .
you &apos;re too late .
sheldon , this is silly .
you got emotional when that lab monkey died .
that lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language .
great .
now i &apos;m gonna have that song in my head all day .
look , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry for your loss ,
but i think i have something
that might make you feel better .
i got you a new computer !
how could you do that ?
do what ?
choosing a new laptop is an incredibly personal ritual .
you have taken away weeks of agonizing thought ,
tedious research ,
sleepless nights filled with indecision . i j ...
haven &apos;t i lost enough today ?
well , the guy at the store said this one is great .
oh ! oh , the guy !
oh , pardon me .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d spoken to the guy .
yeah , tell me ,
did the guy choose one with a 4k display
and a thunderbolt port ?
yes .
yeah ?
d @-@ did the guy make sure
that this has a one @-@ terabyte solid @-@ state drive ?
yes .
yeah ?
oh , well , was this guy rick from computer solutions on colorado ?
yes .
yeah , well , he does know his stuff .
after you wrap the body in reflective tape ,
the ends get teflon tape so we can get a tight seal .
like this ?
yeah , perfect .
and it helps to have small , delicate fingers .
so don &apos;t be discouraged if you can &apos;t do it as fast
as me and howard .
i don &apos;t know if we have enough solder
to finish these circuit boards .
we had a full spool yesterday .
what can i say ,
i play hard , i solder even harder .
sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off .
it &apos;s like a beer commercial .
well , we got to make a run to the hardware store .
how can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder ?
well , funny story .
so , we have plenty of the 60 / 40 tin @-@ to @-@ lead ratio solder ,
but the spools look a lot like the 63 / 37 tin @-@ to ...
honey , honey , honey , let me stop you .
that is @-@ is not a funny story .
you want to come with us ?
i &apos;m kind of getting into the groove here .
yeah , you guys run to the store
and let the women handle the science for a change .
okay .
we &apos;ll be back as soon as we can .
okay , so what ...
is solder ?
i suppose i should set this up .
or would you like to rob me of that , too ?
knock it off or i &apos;ll start making w @-@ h sounds
for words that just have a w.
you wouldn &apos;t .
&quot; hwatch &quot; me .
fine . i &apos;m sorry .
thank you for the thoughtful gift .
i really do appreciate it .
as you know , i had become attached to my old laptop .
but i &apos;m sure , in time , that this one will ...
jeepers creepers ,
that started up fast !
i thought you might like it .
look at the 4k resolution .
next time we skype , i &apos;m gonna count
all those nostril hairs .
or you could just look into my eyes .
but you only have two eyes .
you got a lot of nostril hairs .
well , you know , as long as you &apos;re happy .
i am .
and rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it .
oh . uh , no , no , no , thank you .
oh , but he said you can get store credit .
well , no , i just ... i @-@ i don &apos;t want to recycle it .
and i don &apos;t want store credit .
but why wouldn &apos;t ...
can we please change the subject ?
o @-@ okay .
how &apos; bout we change it to why you &apos;re being weird about this ?
i &apos;m not being weird .
it &apos;s hard to explain .
sheldon , just tell me .
it might be easier to show you .
okay .
we &apos;d have to take your car .
all right .
and i &apos;m gonna need you to sign a nondisclosure agreement .
well , i signed one before we slept together .
why not now ?
penny says they &apos;re having fun working on the prototype .
remember when her fun was
nightclubs and drinking games ?
i know . i &apos;m lowering the bar so slowly .
this time next year she &apos;ll have a coin collection .
excuse me .
you guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie ?
oh . sorry , we can &apos;t .
well , hang on . what movie is it ?
oh , i can &apos;t tell you . but it does star will smith .
wait .
i bet it &apos;s suicide squad .
let &apos;s check it out .
what about the girls ?
penny just said they &apos;re having fun .
honestly , you want to wrap tape around
a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon ?
okay , we &apos;ll take &apos; em .
okay .
but , i swear ,
if it &apos;s will smith in shark tale 2,
风评并不佳
it better be at least as good as the original .
i mean , it &apos;s crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
i moved here from nebraska to be an actress ,
and now i &apos;m sitting in an engineering lab at caltech
helping to build a prototype for a high @-@ tech guidance system .
it is crazy .
it &apos;s also crazy that i &apos;ve made 14 of these
and you &apos;ve made three .
hey . where are the guys ?
oh , they went to the store to get solder ,
which is metal you melt to make science things .
since when do you work on weekends ?
i &apos;m an astrophysicist .
the stars don &apos;t take a day off .
you were home alone and had no one to play with ?
well , the cleaning lady was there , but she doesn &apos;t like me .
you need any help ?
not with lightning mcqueen here .
i think we &apos;re good .
okay . that &apos;s cool .
i guess everybody &apos;s involved in this project but me .
so ... see ya .
i feel bad .
should we have asked him to stay ?
yes .
will you please tell me where we &apos;re going ?
sorry , you &apos;re on a need @-@ to @-@ know basis .
i &apos;m driving the car .
i need to know .
right .
so where are we going ?
no , i meant turn right , and you missed it .
maybe you do need to know .
what are we gonna tell the girls ?
it &apos;s not a problem .
i mean without lying .
and now you &apos;ve made it a problem .
come on . we &apos;re a couple of smart guys .
i &apos;m sure we can come up with a way to explain this
that doesn &apos;t make us look bad .
the boys had to drive all the way to san bernardino
for the solder and got a flat .
they bought it .
but we &apos;re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back .
oh , you &apos;re good at this .
well , i lie a lot .
hey , guys , thank you
for being a part of our test screening .
you &apos;re about to be one of the first audiences to see suicide squad .
you were right .
oh , i keep telling you--
good things happen to bad people .
uh , we &apos;re gonna get started in a couple minutes . enjoy .
who are you texting ?
raj . he really wants to see this movie .
oh , he &apos;ll never make it in time .
i know . i want to make him feel bad .
&quot; ha , ha . leonard and i are about to see suicide squad .
spoiler alert : when i see you i &apos;m gonna spoil it . &quot;
you &apos;re a good friend .
okay .
would you ladies please leave the room for a moment ?
why ?
i need to rub my genitals on their prototype .
what &apos;s going on ?
leonard and howard don &apos;t have a flat .
they went to the movies . look .
son of a bitch .
un @-@ freakin &apos; believable .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna let them know
that i &apos;m here with you and that they &apos;re busted .
no . you know what ? don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
let &apos;s let them think they &apos;re getting away with it .
yeah , let &apos;s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves .
interesting .
i mean , it &apos;s not testicles on a cryostat ,
but i like it .
why do you have a storage unit ?
just wait .
how long have you had it ?
just wait .
do you want me to hold that computer ?
just wai ... you know what ? actually , yes , thank you .
welcome to my fortress of shame .
i &apos;m sorry .
what @-@ what am i looking at ?
it &apos;s basically everything i &apos;ve ever owned .
um , every book , every t @-@ shirt ,
every piece of broken electronics .
just ... all of it .
all of it ?
i have a ziploc bag
filled with all my old ziploc bags .
okay .
i would like to tell you that
there is nothing here to be ashamed of .
so i &apos;m gonna need a minute .
all right , how are we gonna play this when they return ?
i know .
you guys should totally be making out with me .
sweetie , i know you think jokes like that are funny ,
but do you really think you could handle
making out with both of us ?
no , ma &apos;am .
okay . okay , how about this ?
they don &apos;t know you &apos;re here with us ,
so you hide in the closet .
when they show up ,
we &apos;ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were ,
we &apos;ll pretend to believe them ,
and just when they think they got away with it ,
you jump out .
yeah , that &apos;s pretty good .
i love it !
i &apos;ll be all like , &quot; busted ! &quot;
and they &apos;ll be like , &quot; what ? ! &quot;
and then we &apos;ll all be like , &quot; oh , yeah ! &quot;
yeah , i @-@ i get it .
i wouldn &apos;t make out with me , either .
in here is every clock radio i &apos;ve ever owned .
calculators , vhs tapes .
sporting equipment .
y @-@ you have sporting equipment ?
well , oh , it &apos;s just a ... it &apos;s a ... a golf ball
that my brother threw at my head .
you can still feel the dent .
it &apos;s right next to the hockey puck dent .
okay , why do you have a bin of pinecones ?
i used to collect them as a child .
the spiral of scales open in
the fibonacci sequence .
a fact that , when you tell your brother ,
gets a golf ball thrown at your head .
so , why do you feel you need to save these things ?
i &apos;d like to say it &apos;s nostalgia ,
but every time i think of throwing anything away ,
my ears start to ring ,
and i get butterflies in my stomach .
and then it feels like
the butterflies get eaten by rats ,
and then , the @-@ the rats get eaten by ...
okay . i get it . i get it .
it ends with dinosaurs .
i &apos;m sorry if you think less of me .
i don &apos;t .
really ?
&apos;cause every time i come in here ,
i think less of me .
why ?
because i &apos;m a fraud .
no . i purport to be a man of the mind .
i &apos;ve been such a @-@ a vocal champion of the singularity ,
but how can i leave my body behind
and become one with the internet
when i &apos;ve never even thrown a toothbrush away ?
it &apos;s okay , sheldon .
you know , i ... i &apos;ve saved a lot of weird things , too .
like what ?
did you know i have a microscope slide
with a little bit of tissue
from the first brain i ever dissected ?
i have an old teddy bear
i secretly wiped my nose on for years .
it &apos;s not a contest .
okay , here they come .
go hide .
oh , man , when i come out of the closet ,
i &apos;m gonna nail those guys !
yeah , i heard it . shut up .
hey , what &apos;s this ?
listen , we did a stupid thing .
we went to a movie and lied about it ,
but we feel bad
and want to make it up to you .
so , these are for you , and if you &apos;re not too mad ,
we &apos;d love to take you guys to dinner .
yeah . anywhere you want .
well , thank you for being honest .
yeah . you know , i want to be upset ,
but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype .
don &apos;t forgive them ! stay mad at them !
what is he doing in there ?
busting you !
it &apos;s okay . they apologized .
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
well this is kind of anti @-@ climactic .
you know what wasn &apos;t anti @-@ climactic ?
the end of the movie . get this .
no spoilers ! no spoilers !
and he &apos;s back in the closet .
ready for dinner ?
yeah .
should we invite raj ?
yes .
so , no one else knows about this ?
only you .
thank you for trusting me .
what good is having a girlfriend
if you can &apos;t unload your psychological sewage on her ?
that &apos;s me , your emotional outhouse .
you know ,
if you ever decide you want to do something about this ,
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m here for you .
thank you .
i wouldn &apos;t even know how to begin .
baby steps , i guess .
i suppose i could try getting rid of the golf ball .
oh . okay .
i will always have the dent to remember it by .
you did it .
do you feel okay ?
actually , yes .
i do .
well , i &apos;m proud of you .
oh . thanks .
i &apos;m glad i told you about the storage unit .
well , i feel closer to you now .
oh , i feel closer to you , too .
you know ,
it &apos;s still a couple of hours until my bedtime .
what did you have in mind ?
you look amazing .
i mean , this resolution is remarkable .
i really had to go home for this ?
yes , but it &apos;s like you &apos;re right here in the room .
and yet , i &apos;m not .
but i feel like i could reach out and touch you .
and yet , you can &apos;t .
i know !
