i &apos;d like callie to spend one day a week with her father .
i will see robert , but i won &apos;t see anyone else .
there &apos;s nothing that you can say that will make me forgive you .
if you don &apos;t forgive me , i &apos;ll kill myself .
i &apos;ve done everything i &apos;m supposed to ,
they still won &apos;t give me visitation .
take this with you and you go up to the door and you knock .
that &apos;s a little over my budget .
this bracelet just went on sale . sixty percent off .
why don &apos;t you just move in until the baby &apos;s born ?
you didn &apos;t tell me ana &apos;s pregnant .
mom told me not to .
she can &apos;t take care of a baby , mom .
even with mike &apos;s help .
i can &apos;t believe you told your mom ... again .
i can &apos;t be friends with a little bitch that
tells his mom every time something happens .
idyllwild would like to offer you a full ride
to their summer music program .
it &apos;s not gonna be some kind of crazy ,
drug @-@ fueled , you know , trashing hotels kind of tour .
we &apos;ll set aside enough money
to make sure we &apos;re staying in motels .
oh , my god . that is huge . why would you do this ? !
&apos;cause i wanted to show hayley how much i liked her .
hayley , huh ?
sounds like a real heartbreaker .
can it be removed ?
well , luckily it &apos;s just black ink .
that &apos;s the easiest to break down .
break down ?
we zap it with a laser and the body eventually absorbs the ink .
does the zap hurt ?
did it hurt when you got it ?
hell , yeah .
unfortunately , it hurts more to get rid of it .
feels like the snap of a hot rubber band against your skin .
how long does it take ?
five minutes .
that &apos;s not bad .
per session .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re looking at about ten .
ten ?
minimum .
with seven weeks healing time in between .
seven weeks to heal ?
is there scarring or risk of infection ?
not if he follows all the care instructions .
should we get started today ?
today ?
sure , why not ?
please , mom . do i have to do this ?
do you want hayley &apos;s name on your body for the rest of your life ?
no . can &apos;t i just , like , cover it with a dragon ?
everything you do has consequences , jesus .
i &apos;m sorry that this one has to be painful .
now is the time i need you to put on the glasses .
if you &apos;ll just lie back .
i need you to roll over onto your side .
all right .
just try and relax .
here we go .
i know , right ?
is it gone yet ?
no , it takes months .
and it &apos;s torture .
sounds like your relationship with hayley .
yeah , but the tattoo will last longer .
you know , if you add a few extra
letters you could turn it into &quot; epic fail ... y . &quot;
ha @-@ ha , very funny . i get it .
ok ? i &apos;m an idiot .
you &apos;re not an idiot .
that &apos;s what everyone thinks .
that &apos;s not true .
everyone stop teasing him .
yeah , before we go around this table
and call you out on all the mistakes you guys have made .
so , uh , any idea when you guys
might decide if i can go on tour this summer ?
just the band really needs to know .
yes , we have actually decided .
we &apos;ve discussed it at great length with your father
and we all agree that you can go .
what ? i can ?
are you insane ? ! after all the dumb stuff he &apos;s done ?
he sold fake ids at school !
hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . what are you doing ?
you really think that you can trust him to spend all summer
driving around in a van with
a bunch of kids playing dive bars and raves ?
there &apos;s not gonna be any raves . what &apos;s with the sabotage ?
listen , we are well aware of the potential for misadventure here .
which is why we have conditions .
what conditions ?
they want to meet our parents ?
well , yeah . you know , just to , uh , get on the same page .
about what ?
about , like , uh ...
you know , that we &apos;ll be checking in a couple times a day .
and , uh , you know , that we have a plan .
like an itinerary ?
we &apos;re not going on a cruise .
yeah . plans change , depending on gigs that might come up .
we won &apos;t know in advance , where we &apos;ll be every night .
yeah , no , no . i know . i know .
it &apos;s more of like an overall , kind of general idea .
uh , and there &apos;s another thing .
they want us to stay in motels .
but i did the math ,
and , you know , if we all stay
in one room at one of those $ 99 @-@ a @-@ night places ,
then it &apos;s only $ 25 bucks each .
times 20 nights .
five benjamins a person ? no way .
my buddy did a tour last summer ,
they always found somewhere to crash .
look , it &apos;s , it &apos;s ... non @-@ negotiable .
my parents want us to stay in motels or they won &apos;t let us go .
well ... won &apos;t let you go .
what , like you &apos;d go without me ?
jesus ! what is that ?
it &apos;s my bandage .
that is so gross .
what &apos;s your deal tonight ?
i don &apos;t have a &quot; deal . &quot;
tell that to brandon .
hey , look , i just don &apos;t think
that he should be out on the road all summer .
you don &apos;t think mat should be out on the road all summer .
with all those groupies flashing their boobs in his face .
shut up .
and stop leaving your hazardous waste around .
it &apos;s disgusting and rude .
this is your fault .
you narc &apos;ed to moms about my tattoo .
because i had to hear about ana from epic fail @-@ y .
because you freaked the hell out any time i mention her .
will you please throw that away ?
and i &apos;m done freaking out about ana
because i &apos;m never having a relationship with her .
what about her baby ? it &apos;s gonna be our brother or our sister .
have you thought about that ?
so , how come connor doesn &apos;t come over anymore ?
um ... i don &apos;t know .
we sort of had a fight .
about what ?
just stuff .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
that &apos;s my line .
yeah , well , you &apos;re not the only one who gets to use it .
ouch .
ok . sorry i care .
you know , i was thinking about tomorrow ,
when you go see robert .
what about it ?
he said he just wants a relationship with you , right ?
i mean , if that &apos;s all he wants ,
why can &apos;t you just call him &quot; dad , &quot; or whatever .
you know , play along .
see him once a week .
and then maybe he &apos;ll back off .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s that simple .
how do you know ?
what &apos;re you working on ?
oh , just these grant applications .
if we don &apos;t get our english api scores up , we won &apos;t even qualify .
i cannot believe timothy ...
did i tell you ana is living with mike ?
i mean , he says it &apos;s only temporary
until she gets a job and finds her own place .
but you know what i think ?
i think that it &apos;s dani all over again .
has he forgotten what ana did ?
i wonder what the hell his sponsor &apos;s telling him .
i &apos;d like to know . seriously ...
seriously , i am sick of talking about mike .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just ...
obsessed with every bad decision he makes .
that affects our children .
so we keep our kids safe and away from ana .
that &apos;s all we can do , or should do .
we don &apos;t want to add mike &apos;s problems to our plate .
we already have enough stress as it is .
i &apos;m sorry , love . you were talking about timothy ?
no , just ... you know what ,
i &apos;m tired .
the grant . i &apos;m all ears , love .
let &apos;s go to sleep .
good night .
love you .
i love you , too .
can i help you find something ?
uh , no thanks . i &apos;m just looking .
for ... ?
uh , a gift for a girl .
uh , my sister . she &apos;s 14 .
what &apos;s she into ?
i &apos;m not sure , ...
... clothes , emo , horses .
you must be close .
no , we didn &apos;t ... we don &apos;t live together .
wow , those are perfect .
i &apos;ll ring you up over here .
ten dollars .
nice bracelet . did you get that here ?
uh , my brother did , i think .
it was a christmas present .
i remember him .
you were here around then too .
you bought a little toy ?
yeah . good memory .
i hope your sister likes them .
me , too . thanks .
i could have got that .
it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;re the pregnant one . i should be waiting on you .
well that is the least i can do .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
so , i &apos;ll pick you up this afternoon ,
take you to your doctor &apos;s appointment .
you don &apos;t have to drive me .
i want to .
i was thinking of calling her isabella .
what do you think ?
i think that &apos;s a beautiful name .
hey , brian .
i &apos;m stef adams @-@ foster .
we met a few months ago when mike got his 90 @-@ day chip .
the first one .
right . you &apos;re the ex @-@ wife .
yeah .
and you are his sponsor , yes ?
hey , i was looking for you .
you were ?
yeah , uh ,
can we switch lab partners ?
it &apos;s just , uh , daria asked me to be her partner , so ...
yeah . uh , it &apos;s cool .
oh , uh , jude ?
yeah .
the potato ?
taylor has yours .
sucks getting sexiled .
&quot; sexiled ? &quot;
when your friend leaves you hangin &apos; for their new boo .
when did they become ... boos ?
like , five minutes ago .
but if you ask daria , they &apos;re &quot; otp . &quot;
but , hey , i &apos;m down with being partners if you are ?
yeah ... totally down .
we just have to take everything out .
yeah .
you ready for the algebra midterm ?
yeah . no .
why ?
coach wanted me to ask .
he &apos;s trying to make sure the
star of the team doesn &apos;t go on academic probation .
&quot; star of the team . &quot;
never been a fan of false modesty , foster .
well i &apos;ve been studying ... a little .
i will because i broke up with hayley .
you broke up with her ?
yeah .
so now i &apos;ll be completely focused on the midterm , i swear .
well , you should probably get a tutor .
yeah . that &apos;s a good idea .
could you tell coach that i won &apos;t let the team down ?
i promise .
hey , jude ! come here .
oh , my god , taylor was just telling us
how funny you were in science class today .
sit . come have lunch with us .
ok .
did you guys get your bulb lit ?
uh , yeah . creepy to think
there &apos;s electricity in your french fries .
so , who &apos;s dying to see bright lights ?
we read the book last summer and we are totally obsessed .
what &apos;s the movie about ?
it &apos;s a chick flick .
hey , why don &apos;t we all go see it tonight as a group ?
yeah , sure . sounds good .
yeah .
uh , i have to make sure i can .
there &apos;s a 7 : 00 and my mom can totally drive us .
here , just put your number in my phone .
awesome .
we have to go to the bathroom before class .
i guess i have to pee .
see you later .
if you want , i can ...
... i can say my moms won &apos;t let me go .
no . no , it &apos;s fine . i don &apos;t mind if you go .
so is daria your girlfriend ?
i guess .
yeah .
i didn &apos;t know you ... liked her .
well , she &apos;s hot .
uh ... do you like taylor ?
yeah . she &apos;s nice .
we &apos;re probably gonna be the only dudes in the movie theater .
yeah , probably .
hey , brainiac . lunch ?
how about ... yo shorty , wanna eat ?
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m having lunch with tia .
we &apos;ve gotta talk about dance team auditions .
aw , come on . there &apos;s a ...
there &apos;s a half pb &amp; j in it for you .
the organic kind where the
peanuts were sung to every night by the farmers .
ok , look ,
i know you don &apos;t think that
my dance team is as important as your band ,
but i have to have something
to do all summer while you &apos;re off on tour .
ok . um ...
sorry , i ...
but i &apos;ll see you later tonight after practice ?
i don &apos;t know . i have to study .
midterms are coming up and
i &apos;ve got tons of coding to do for stem club .
is everything cool with us ?
i &apos;m just really busy .
what does that mean ? busy , like , tonight or ...
i just don &apos;t think that i have time for a relationship right now .
so , um ...
can we talk about this later ?
tia &apos;s waiting on me .
you talked to my sponsor ?
do you know how inappropriate that was ? !
as inappropriate as your relationship with ana ?
what ? that &apos;s none of your business !
and none of your sponsor &apos;s either , apparently .
you had no right , stef .
what , to tell him about ana ?
he had no idea who she was .
it was an invasion of my privacy and the program .
the program ? you &apos;re not working the program , mike .
you &apos;re not even being honest with your own sponsor .
you don &apos;t get to take my inventory .
no , but i do get to protect my children .
from the woman who abused them
and then wormed her way back into their lives .
she &apos;s not that person anymore .
and took advantage of them .
just like she &apos;s taking advantage of you .
because you &apos;re so afraid that you
can &apos;t save yourself without saving someone else .
you don &apos;t what the hell you &apos;re talking about !
she almost destroyed your life , mike !
maybe that &apos;s what you want . maybe you want to self @-@ destruct .
maybe that &apos;s easier than staying sober .
shut up . you can steamroll over
everybody in your life , but not me .
so why don &apos;t you mind your own business
and get the hell out of my life .
you got that ?
hello ?
hey , uh , it &apos;s me .
i got hung up . i &apos;m on my way .
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;ll call the doctor .
i &apos;m sure we can reschedule .
i &apos;m really sorry .
do we need anything from the store for dinner ?
no . we &apos;re fine .
don &apos;t rush .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
sorry .
so where &apos;s he taking you ?
don &apos;t know . don &apos;t care .
you just have to spend a few hours with the man .
yeah , a few awful awkward hours .
cut him a break . he just wants to see his kid .
so , um , have you heard anything about tasha ?
i get my first supervised visit on saturday .
what ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i don &apos;t wanna jinx it .
aren &apos;t you excited ?
yeah , but ... last time i seen her ...
she won &apos;t remember that .
what if she remembers being scared
&apos;cause some stranger took her ?
you &apos;re not a stranger . you &apos;re her mother .
at some level she &apos;s gotta feel that connection .
do your moms know you &apos;re here ?
no .
they don &apos;t want you to see me unsupervised .
i &apos;m not really here to see you .
i mean , i came here because
the baby is my ...
... is gonna be my ...
sister .
it &apos;s a girl .
i just ...
i don &apos;t want her ...
to go through what we did .
i don &apos;t want her to feel like she isn &apos;t enough .
and to spend her whole life
scared that people are gonna leave her .
and i just don &apos;t think that you can be a mother .
i don &apos;t think that you can take care of a baby .
and maybe ... maybe you can &apos;t help it , but ...
i don &apos;t want another little girl to get hurt ...
... like i did .
hot date ?
no .
connor and i are going to a movie with some girls .
as a group .
as a group ?
that &apos;s what people tell their parents
when they don &apos;t want them to know what they &apos;re really doing .
what are we really doing ?
&quot; going to the movies . &quot;
a dark place you can do things with a girl
that you can &apos;t do in the light .
hooking up ?
here . walk into this .
why ?
girls love a guy who smells good .
hi , mrs. adams @-@ foster .
emma , hi .
what are you ... are you here for ...
me . hey .
ok . are you two ... ?
no .
she &apos;s tutoring me .
oh , good !
great , actually . it &apos;s nice to see you , emma .
wanna get started ? go up ?
why don &apos;t you two use the dining room ?
sounds good .
mm . you smell awfully nice .
i just showered .
hello . come on in .
hey , callie ? robert &apos;s here .
you have a beautiful home .
we like it . so does callie .
you look nice .
thank you .
so , have her home by , uh , what , ten ?
sounds good .
do you need a sweater , honey ?
no , it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
i love you .
love you .
bye .
thanks .
don &apos;t forget to apply the distributive property .
ok . then multiply .
and express as a rational function .
boom !
you got it .
you &apos;re the only one who gets me to understand this crap .
&quot; f times &quot; g &quot; times &quot; x &quot; ?
without you , it looks like somebody barfed up alphabet soup .
thanks for doing this .
yeah , just takin &apos; one for the team .
so ... you &apos;re miserable ?
completely .
i &apos;m really sorry .
for what ?
i should &apos;ve been honest about hooking up with hayley .
i mean , technically we were broken up ...
so &quot; technically &quot; this doesn &apos;t sound like a real apology .
it is . last few months , i made some stupid decisions .
really stupid decisions .
it &apos;s ok .
i forgive you .
and ... i &apos;ve missed you .
i miss you , too .
wh ... what &apos;re you doing ?
you need to get a new tutor .
wait !
maybe a guy .
no , no . i need you .
we can be friends , i swear .
look ! i &apos;ll prove it to you .
that picture there was taken with a hasselblad .
it has that ... that , like ,
look @-@ down @-@ style viewing screen , you know ,
and a hand crank to advance the film .
you ever shot with film ?
no , just digital .
i &apos;d like to , it just costs too much to develop .
well , you could always set up your own dark room ,
learn how to develop yourself .
yeah well , there &apos;s , uh ...
... there &apos;s not really a lot of extra space where i live , so ...
well , anyway , the hasselblad is responsible
for that beautiful blur you see in the photograph .
they call it &quot; bokeh . &quot;
you can &apos;t get that kind of effect with a digital camera really .
how do you know so much about photography ?
well , it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s always been a hobby that i share with sophia .
you know , actually , you both have a better eye than i do .
how &apos;s she doing ?
well , her doctors think it &apos;s some kind of
personality disorder .
i &apos;m not entirely sure what that means , to be honest with you .
she &apos;s on medication ,
which is helping .
but they want her to stay at the treatment center
a little while longer ,
just so they can ...
... you know , keep an eye on her .
i &apos;m really sorry i didn &apos;t realize how sad she was .
we didn &apos;t either , and we &apos;re her parents .
i got her a gift .
a pair of hair pins with horses on them .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;ll like it .
are you kidding me ? she &apos;ll love them .
especially since they &apos;re from you .
thank you .
what , are you not a fan of cilantro ?
yeah , i don &apos;t really like it .
it kind of tastes like ...
soap ?
hold on .
you think that showing me
you got the name of the girl who you hooked up with
a hot minute after we broke up ,
tattooed over half your torso ,
is proof that we can be friends ?
because ... knowing you did something that stupid means that
i won &apos;t ever be attracted to you again .
and if you know that
i won &apos;t ever be attracted to you again , then ...
... you won &apos;t try to get back together with me ?
yes .
that is some strange logic .
but it kind of makes sense , right ?
well , i definitely never want to see you shirtless ever again .
please , emma . wrestling &apos;s all i have .
everything else i screw up .
if i fail algebra
i &apos;ll just be a loser with a stupid tattoo .
ok .
i &apos;m getting the tattoo removed , though .
jesus , just quit while you &apos;re ahead .
i never get to order this .
jill and sophia are always insisting on something chocolate .
no , chocolate is too obvious .
cheers to that .
so ... have you ever seen
the &quot; ashes and snow &quot; exhibit ?
no , i &apos;ve never heard of it .
they &apos;re these unbelievable photographs
of humans and animals in nature .
i mean , they &apos;re .. there &apos;s just no words that describe it .
it &apos;s ... it is breathtaking .
wow , i &apos;d love to see it .
well , it &apos;s in la jolla right now . it closes this weekend ,
but if you &apos;re interested and willing ,
you know , maybe we could drive up for the day on sunday .
i mean , it &apos;s ... you know , it &apos;s not a ...
court @-@ mandated ?
yeah . it &apos;s elective , as they say .
i &apos;ll ask stef and lena .
right .
you know , you don &apos;t have to get custody of me to hang out .
if what you want is a relationship ,
we can have that , even if i get adopted by the fosters .
i don &apos;t just want to hang out , callie .
i want to be your dad .
well , you are my dad . genetically .
that &apos;s not gonna change if i get adopted .
i guess i mean , parent . i want to be your parent .
and what about jude ?
you think it &apos;s ok to separate us because you want to &quot; parent &quot; me ?
no , look , that &apos;s not what i want .
but that &apos;s what would happen .
jude can come over whenever he wants .
i mean , he can have his own room .
that &apos;s not what i want . does that not matter to you at all ?
callie , if i had known about you earlier ,
i would have adopted him .
well , it &apos;s too late .
that &apos;s because jude &apos;s dad couldn &apos;t take care of him or you .
but i can .
why ? because we both hate cilantro and you &apos;re rich ?
drive me home , please ?
and i &apos;ll pass on sunday .
where should we sit ?
wherever you want .
oh , actually ... why don &apos;t we sit in the back ?
or we could just sit right there .
yeah , but if people are talking during the movie ,
it &apos;s quieter in the back .
connor ?
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s cool .
yeah , i ... yeah .
cool .
she has to sit on the aisle .
claustrophobic .
no , you &apos;re not . she has a small bladder .
taylor !
i just drink a lot of liquids .
it &apos;s good for you .
sorry , if they start making out
it &apos;ll be really weird sitting right next to them .
thanks . it won &apos;t be weird for me at all .
爱德怀镇来访
hey . no band practice tonight ?
oh , later .
looking for jobs to pay for stupid motel rooms .
i bet you won &apos;t think clean sheets and warm showers
are so stupid on the road .
if i &apos;m on the road .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna make two grand before summer .
what , i thought you guys were splitting it ?
oh , yeah , you thought . but ...
the rest of the band doesn &apos;t have to listen to what you say .
and their parents don &apos;t care where they stay .
they trust them .
we are trusting you by saying yes , brandon .
ok , but with all these conditions that i &apos;m never gonna be able to meet ,
it &apos;s like , why bother ? it &apos;s not a yes , it &apos;s a backdoor &quot; no . &quot;
does dad care where we stay ?
your dad and i are on the same page .
yeah , your page .
ok , listen to me .
if the band wants to go on the road ...
then they will go on tour without me .
we need to talk .
i am sorry that i went to your sponsor .
i admit that i over @-@ stepped .
but i have been very worried about you , mike .
and you know we have a son together ,
so maybe we can get together for a cup of coffee this weekend .
&apos;cause i love you .
can you think of a better reason ? i can &apos;t .
i &apos;ll let you go if you can look me in the eye
and tell me that you don &apos;t feel what i feel .
tom , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s too much .
i know you want this , kendra .
i can see it in your eyes .
all right , let &apos;s call it .
why were you coming in so late on that pre @-@ chorus ?
it was close enough .
you &apos;re the one always harping on timing .
i &apos;ll fix it next time .
so what should we do tonight ?
go out ? stay in ?
you don &apos;t think your moms will come in here will they ?
no .
do you want to talk about it ?
there &apos;s nothing to talk about . right ?
you &apos;ll go on tour with or without me .
what do you expect us to do ?
nothing .
but , you know , if i can &apos;t go ,
what , are you just gonna play my songs ?
they &apos;re our songs .
that i wrote .
i mean , who &apos;s gonna do the harmonies , jasper ?
hey , we were a band before you .
not a very good one .
ego much ?
i just mean that you &apos;re better with me .
no one &apos;s denying that , brandon , but ...
that &apos;s rock and roll , i guess . every man for himself , right ?
ok , look ...
we all know you &apos;re a huge part of this band .
and , yes , we are better with you .
it &apos;s just ... $ 2,000 is a lot of money .
and we need to spend all of our time rehearsing ,
not working minimum wage jobs .
do you expect us to give up the chance to tour
because your parents won &apos;t let you go ?
no .
we really want you to go .
i think i &apos;m just gonna ... be alone tonight .
ok .
you think you can spare a minute for a guy
you may or may not be dating ?
sweet lair .
it &apos;s where i hatch all my plots
to break up with guys for no reason .
so ... what &apos;s going on ? are you ok ?
is it the tour ?
because i &apos;ll be away for three weeks of our first summer together ?
do you want to add anything here , or ...
no , that &apos;s pretty much it .
well , you know , there &apos;s this thing called a telephone .
and i , i hear you can ...
you can take them anywhere now .
i know .
i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;m gonna miss you
i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;m gonna miss you , too .
i want to go on tour ,
but it &apos;s not like i &apos;m looking forward to
the part where you &apos;re not there .
because ...
... i love you .
shut up .
i love you , too .
and you know , we wouldn &apos;t have to miss each other at all
if i went on tour with you .
but ... would your moms let you ?

she wanted to talk about , um , this baby .

well , we &apos;ll talk to mariana about leaving you alone .
she told me that she thought i should ask you
to adopt the baby .

parents who aren &apos;t recovering addicts ...
... who she could depend on .
