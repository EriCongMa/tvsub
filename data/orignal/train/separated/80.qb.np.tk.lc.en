hi . my name is therese dodd
and these are my breasts .
breast cancer is a serious matter .
early detection can save lives .
and so , as a public service ,
i will now demonstrate a self @-@ exam .
this is serious .
you do have a bra on under that , right ?
no , joey ,
what i have is a drive to help women .
yeah , see , we &apos;re live , so it &apos;s probably best ...
okay , there they are .
and did you hear the host say that ?
say we were live ?
yeah .
but i thought it was like a seven @-@ second delay or something .
did you just smile at your lawyer
because he coached you to say that ?
objection .
no , i smiled at my lawyer because he &apos;s cute .
you &apos;re being sued for $ 2 million , ms. dodd .
i would take this more seriously if i were you .
the first step to a self @-@ exam is ...
stop looking over there . i am right here .
cover that up . we &apos;re not ...
the first thing you want to do with your ...
okay !
is touch and massage them like so .
we have placed censor boxes over the offending areas ,
but on that day , your routine was sent out
to eight million households .
but you didn &apos;t care , did you , ms. dodd ?
well , i cared about women being informed about breast cancer .
oh , ms. dodd , really ?
that &apos;s why you disrobed ?
sure .
my mom died of breast cancer last year . why else ?
because you happened to have a humorous book
coming out in two months .
and you didn &apos;t care that you were using vulgar language
in front of eight million viewers ?
what do you mean , &quot; vulgar &quot; ?
which word ?
i think you know , ma &apos;am .
no , i don &apos;t .
honestly , which one ?
it rhymes with &quot; bits . &quot;
it rhymes with &quot; bits &quot; ?
are we eight years old ?
you mean ...
bob , would you close that , please ?
you enjoy using vulgar language to provoke ,
don &apos;t you , ms. dodd ?
i do .
no further questions , your honor .
therese , did you go on the show intending
to take off your blouse ?
no .
and did you feel that the show pushed you
to do something outrageous ?
oh , yeah , they always have me on to push the envelope .
and you were told that the talk show would be delayed
due to a football overrun ?
yes .
and therefore ,
you thought that the show would be broadcast
during the safe harbor period ?
uh ... what ?
safe harbor . it &apos;s the time after 10 : 00 p.m.
and before 6 : 00 a.m.
when network programs can , according to fcc rules ,
show nudity and use language like ...
bob , how are we getting on with that window ?
yes , counselor ,
i thought the show was going on at 10 : 00 p.m.
and therefore , the words you used ,
and the skin you exposed ,
was problematic only due to the network &apos;s self @-@ imposed censorship ?
your honor , it doesn &apos;t matter .
the show was taped in chicago ,
but broadcast live on the west coast at 8 : 00 p.m.
yes , but that wasn &apos;t therese &apos;s decision .
that was the network &apos;s .
she thought the show was safely in the safe harbor .
ms. dodd signed a contract with the network ,
not with the fcc .
let me get this straight .
the fcc says i can strip down naked
and talk dirty like a cable show ,
but the network says i can &apos;t ?
ms. dodd , please let your attorney ask the questions .
i &apos;m just surprised ,
aren &apos;t you ?
the network can show the same stuff as cable ,
but they choose not to ?
your honor , this lawsuit is a sham .
mr. preston and his client , the network ,
know they can &apos;t get $ 2 million from my client .
they are suing her for the same reason
their standards and practices are stricter than the fcc .
for their advertisers .
mr. gardner makes a sound point , mr. preston .
ms. dodd shouldn &apos;t be liable for the network &apos;s choices .
there &apos;s only one question remaining for me
and that &apos;s premeditation .
unless you have evidence to prove ms. dodd went on the show
intending to perform indecent material--
for instance , an earlier and identical stand @-@ up routine--
then i am prone to dismiss .
i don &apos;t understand breasts .
they &apos;re made of fat ;
they sag ; they drool ; and guys still go for them .
it &apos;s like being turned on by jabba the hutt .
i &apos;ve decided to name mine .
this one &apos;s margie .
margie &apos;s the misunderstood one ...
anything yet now ?
no .
another breast routine .
but different material .
do you think she &apos;s funny ?
sometimes .
you ?
it seems like an easy laugh-- breasts .
well , guys make penis jokes .
yeah .
yeah , those are easy , too .
you &apos;ve , um , been spending a lot of time with clarke .
yeah .
everything okay ?
yeah .
he just ... he just likes to talk .
laura ?
oh , hello , alicia .
how are you ?
good .
you &apos;re out of uniform , captain .
permanently . unfortunately .
what ? why ?
my choice .
i was losing my bearings ,
things soured .
i &apos;m on the market now .
whee ...
you &apos;re ... looking for a job ?
yeah .
no , not here .
i &apos;m out there checking out the job market .
this is my interview outfit .
so you &apos;re here ... ?
oh , my bill . i haven &apos;t paid it yet .
oh , god , i &apos;m so sorry .
what ? why ?
we lost .
but we did our best .
don &apos;t worry .
so can you show me to clarke hayden ?
um , that door .
and , laura , if you need anything--
i started over pretty late .
so , if you want to talk .
i &apos;ll call you .
hello ?
hello .
what do you think of brazilian food ?
what do i ... what ?
yes , gus , we take maddie hayward
very seriously as a contender .
but our eye is still on the republican , kresteva .
one question .
maddie &apos;s worth $ 180 million--
that &apos;s a lot of ad buys .
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re not worried ?
i &apos;m telling you , these millionaires always
burn themselves out after a while
because money only gets you so far .
now does anyone have a question about , you know , the issues ?
wait , eli , eli .
what about peter sleeping with a campaign worker ?
is that you , mitch ?
this is crap and you know it .
synth printed it , eli .
a disgraced reporter printed it .
peter florrick has categorically denied these charges ,
and the accuser has been proved a liar .
now , are there any real questions ?
sure . one .
okay . who &apos;s this ?
wexler turner from nsw news .
uh ... okay , go for it .
can you respond to reports that this campaign worker
has identified a distinguishing mark
on peter florrick &apos;s anatomy ?
you &apos;re kidding .
no , sir .
she says he has a birthmark on his penis ,
shaped like brazil .
can you confirm or deny that florrick has such a birthmark ?
this is ...
how dare you , sir ?
&quot; at long last , how dare you &quot; ?
this is an outrage .
do you guys listen to yourselves anymore ?
okay , that &apos;s the morning call for today .
get the candidate on the phone .
where is he ?
and someone call alicia .
rebecca stokes .
i &apos;m a makeup artist with ten years &apos; experience .
and did you do the makeup
for the defendant on the night in question ?
yes . hi , therese .
and when you do the makeup for guests ...
strike that .
was there anything unusual you did
with ms. dodd &apos;s makeup ?
yeah .
uh , no .
i mean , just , um , foundation and blush .
what do you mean ?
was there anything unusual regarding the placement ?
the placement ?
i , uh ...
you usually only do makeup on the face ?
oh , yeah , and sometimes the arms .
and what did ms. dodd ask you to do ?
oh , i see .
she wanted makeup on her chest .
and by her chest , you don &apos;t mean
just the cleavage ?
i do .
no , uh , but you mean more than that ?
oh , yeah .
she wanted both her breasts done .
i thought it was unusual because ,
you know , the camera is only gonna see the cleavage ,
but then it made sense after i saw .
okay .
what do you want ?
$ 2 million .
mr. preston ,
our client can &apos;t pay a tenth of that .
she can when her book comes out .
and how will that look for your network ,
bankrupting a comedian whose mother died of breast cancer ?
it &apos;ll look like we take decency on our airwaves seriously .
then have our client apologize .
have her do a psa for you .
no . thank you , though .
yes , mr. hayden .
nothing . just clearing my throat .
then we have nothing to negotiate .
we &apos;ll see you in court .
parents against indecency
have bombarded the fcc with letters and complaints
regarding ms. dodd &apos;s little stunt .
and our expectation is the fcc
will fine us the maximum : $ 3 million .
mr. preston , we &apos;ve already made clear our client can &apos;t ...
over the next two days ,
i &apos;m meeting individually
with three of the fcc commissioners to lobby them .
the three swing votes .
there is one thing your client can do to quash our suit .
apologize .
tell them the saintly story of her mom dying of cancer ,
and her sense of overexuberance at wanting to do something about it .
you &apos;ll quash the suit if she does ?
no , i &apos;ll quash the suit if she &apos;s successful .
she needs to convince two of the three swing votes
for the fcc to drop their fine .
she does that , she doesn &apos;t pay a cent .
we have no choice .
i know . that &apos;s not the concern .
the concern is her .
she won &apos;t go ?
no , she will . she just ...
she needs a babysitter .
alicia , you go with her to d.c.
make sure she stays in line .
uh , cary will go with you .
i don &apos;t think we need two .
i can stay .
do you mind giving us a minute ?
sure .
you don &apos;t think alicia can do it ?
no , i think we need to use cary more .
he &apos;s taking a backseat on too many cases .
he complained ?
no , he didn &apos;t have to . i noticed .
you think i &apos;m holding him back ?
i think you &apos;re the head of litigation ,
and we need to use cary more .
that &apos;s all .
what &apos;s going on there ?
nice to meet you , mr. hayden .
and you .
lockhart / gardner is a good firm .
it has the feel of a family @-@ run business ,
but the client base of a portman &amp; michaels .
i don &apos;t think i ...
you know we &apos;re on opposite sides of this suit ?
i also know you &apos;re looking to expand
from l.a. to the midwest .
we &apos;re looking to build , not purchase .
yes , but isn &apos;t it easier to remodel an existing home
than to build a new one ?
not if the foundation is compromised .
well , why don &apos;t you test the foundation
to see if it &apos;s compromised ?
does the firm want to be acquired ?
it &apos;s not up to the firm .
it &apos;s up to the courts .
with my input .
then i &apos;ll consider it .
you want to know what ?
we don &apos;t want to know anything .
i do .
how is it even possible
to have a birthmark shaped like brazil ?
so , you don &apos;t ?
no , jim . i don &apos;t .
would you like to check ?
okay , here &apos;s the problem .
we buried the affair story ,
but this is different .
this is late @-@ night fodder .
it &apos;s also the perfect political trap .
we can &apos;t have the candidate say that he doesn &apos;t have
a brazil @-@ shaped birthmark on his penis .
we can &apos;t have surrogates say it because how did they see ?
we could have the wife .
no . no .
then we change the subject .
boy .
you ever wonder about this country ?
all the time .
well , here &apos;s the real worry .
if this is the perfect political trap ,
i don &apos;t think indira starr was smart enough to think it up .
kresteva ?
sounds like him .
i think our republican opponent is up to his old tricks .
i &apos;m on it .
what do you have ?
to change the subject ?
a rumor .
maddie hayward , your primary opponent--
she &apos;s sleeping with her aide .
mmm , not big enough . she &apos;s single .
the aide is a girl .
okay .
our fingerprints cannot be on this .
and get some photos if you can .
so , i have to tell three fcc commissioners
about my mom dying of cancer ?
i believe in you .
do you like coldplay ?
do i like them ?
enough .
i hate them .
okay .
when i get to the part about my mom &apos;s hair falling out ,
i want you to hum &quot; fix you . &quot;
she only needs two of the three swing votes .
can she do it ?
she &apos;s motivated .
good .
it must be difficult , this bankruptcy .
not really .
but you &apos;ve lost 40 % of your attorneys ?
we still have our major clients .
even family law ?
they have their major clients ?
yes . why ?
rank , unfettered curiosity .
you don &apos;t have to tell me .
i &apos;m on your side .
wow . that was easy .
they made me think i had to take you in the next room
and give you a ...
so , we can depend on your vote , sir ?
certainly .
but i &apos;ve always thought you network folk
were too terrified of us at the fcc anyway .
we &apos;re not the ones infantilizing entertainment .
that &apos;s what i told him .
so hypocritical .
you allow yourselves to show naked bodies
just as long as they &apos;re bruised and covered in blood .
yeah . why is that , burl ?
we &apos;re not talking about ...
tell us .
okay . thank you so much , commissioner gill .
i haven &apos;t talked about my mom dying yet .
that &apos;s okay , therese .
okay . thank you .
nice paperweight .
first effort in metal shop or something ?
that &apos;s from 9 / 11 .
damn those terrorists and their paperweights .
i know , i know .
comedy killer .
do you think we &apos;ll be all right ?
he &apos;s on board , but we can &apos;t be going off script like that .
cary ?
sir .
i didn &apos;t know you were in town .
work . the fcc .
but you &apos;re still with , um ... ?
lockhart / gardner , yeah .
uh , excuse me .
this is my colleague , alicia florrick .
my father , jeffrey agos .
really ?
what a pleasure to meet you , mr. agos .
and you .
how &apos;s mom ?
good .
last i heard .
martha ?
uh , overseas in china .
back in a month .
and how &apos;s , uh , that girl of yours ?
that girl ? which one ?
the last one . the pretty one .
you mean from law school ?
yes .
i haven &apos;t seen her in five years , dad .
it was a pleasure to meet you , mr. agos .
cary is quite the lawyer .
so , who are you here to see ?
commissioner bix today .
martinez tomorrow .
ah . you want me to put in a good word for you ?
had lunch with them both .
no , we &apos;re fine .
how long you been doing this ?
watching maddie &apos;s house ?
no . this . the business .
a while .
me , too .
that her ?
the aide ?
no .
who is it ?
indira starr .
she &apos;s meeting with maddie hayward ?
that explains who &apos;s behind the birthmark rumor .
first of all , no 9 @-@ 11 jokes ,
are we agreed ?
oh , no .
i thought the commissioner was just meeting with us .
what ?
punch sutton .
the chair of parents against indecency .
hello .
oh , hi , laura . how are you ?
good . really good , i think .
i just ... i need your help .
do you know eddie kolakowski at armstrong , hayes &amp; legarde ?
uh , yes . i mean , by name .
do you think you could call him and say nice things about me ?
certainly . so , the interview went well ?
i hate saying that and jinxing things ,
but they said it &apos;s between me and one other person .
that &apos;s fantastic .
in this economy ?
i know . it &apos;s really a cattle call out here .
well , i will call .
and congratulations .
don &apos;t say that yet .
take it back .
we have over 3,000 complaints , commissioner ,
all regarding this full frontal nudity .
yes , but all those complaints were organized
by parents against indecency itself .
we have children , just like you .
we &apos;re worried about the vulgarization of our culture .
this isn &apos;t about one swear word or a glimpse of a breast .
this is about the floodgates ...
but the floodgates are open , sir .
the screens have multiplied--
with ipads , ipods , the internet ...
then you should be happy .
there are many avenues for this type of content .
but why is it wrong to insist on one place where parents
don &apos;t always have to be on the defensive ?
don &apos;t .
but you allowed exactly
this kind of nudity and profanity on network tv , commissioner .
i did not .
schindler &apos;s list
had full frontal nudity
and was shown , without fcc objection ,
at 9 : 00 p.m.
do you really want to suggest ms. dodd &apos;s little striptease
had the same merit as schindler &apos;s list ?
if you were a woman with breast cancer , it does .
it is our argument that the spielberg exception is unfair restraint .
you can &apos;t make an allowance for one filmmaker and not another .
they don &apos;t make it for a filmmaker ,
they make it for a filmmaker &apos;s work .
ms. dodd , what are your thoughts ?
oh . well ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m any less decent than spielberg .
i mean , have you seen him eat ?
maybe it would help if you explain to
commissioner bix your reasons for your breast exam .
yeah . well , uh , my mom died .
she was funny .
and , uh , she got breast cancer .
i remember the day she died .
i think she had gas or something
because she just let out the most massive ...
... passing of gas .
and , uh , she kept cracking jokes about it .
uh , and i just thought , wow .
you know , i couldn &apos;t believe it .
so close to death and still making jokes .
i just can &apos;t do it .
i know what you want-- me holding her hand
and staring into her deep , sad eyes--
but ... anything else .
i &apos;ll kitsch up anything you want , but just not this .
then get ready to pay $ 2 million .
no . gill is still with us , so i think we &apos;re tied .
we &apos;re not sure about bix .
it all comes down to tomorrow-- commissioner martinez .
okay , good . keep us in touch .
oh , and one other thing .
this might not be anything , but ...
burl &apos;s been asking about our firm .
he ... what do you mean ?
he asked about chapter 11 , how it &apos;s going .
what did you say ?
i said we were doing well .
that we had our major clients .
was that the wrong thing to say ?
i don &apos;t know . was there anything else ?
he asked about family law , how it was doing .
uh , one second , alicia .
he &apos;s after us .
that &apos;s what the meeting with clarke was yesterday .
alicia , if you get a chance ,
tell him we lost our top client , edelstein .
you want me to emphasize we &apos;re not doing well ?
yes , please .
um , we &apos;ll call again .
our trustee is looking for a buyer .
preston is mostly about divorce .
that &apos;s why family law .
what do we do ?
we could fight in court .
the judge will side with clarke .
we need $ 60 million to get out from under him .
we &apos;re at $ 12 million .
no , she was great .
just out of the military , right ?
right . i just wanted to offer a reference ,
tell you how great she is .
yeah , she seemed great .
so , are you looking for litigators with trial experience ?
well , actually , between us , we &apos;re not looking for anyone .
you &apos;re not ?
sh @-@ she seemed to think there was a job there .
well , we like to keep our hand in .
meet and interview , see who &apos;s out there .
same as you guys .
so , are you going to tell her there &apos;s no job ?
what do you mean ?
well , she thinks it &apos;s between her and someone else .
oh . could you hold for a moment , please ?
hello .
hello . is cary there ?
cary ... ? oh . no . mr. agos ?
uh , this is alicia florrick .
i &apos;m in 206 .
he &apos;s next door in 207 .
ah . well , my apologies .
thank you .
mr. kolakowski ? i &apos;m ...
hello ?
hello ...
no , i just ... i hadn &apos;t seen him in years . he &apos;s ...
we &apos;re not very close .
he &apos;s a lobbist ?
yeah . yeah , so is my mom .
my new mom .
you should have breakfast with him .
why ?
because he asked you .
i said we were busy . maybe another time .
cary , we &apos;re not busy .
he &apos;s ... probably trying to make amends .
call him back .
why ?
because you only get so much family in life .
this seems to matter more to me than it does to you .
wait , no ...
more to you ...
no , i just ...
it was nice to see you with family .
my dad kicked me out the door when i was 18 .
&apos;cause his dad kicked him out the door when he was 18 .
he never gave me a cent .
never wanted to know what i was doing .
when i got the deputyship at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
he never said a thing .
that &apos;s probably why he &apos;s calling now .
to try to make up for it .
people change on you .
you changed on me .
me ?
no .
oh , you don &apos;t notice it ?
you &apos;re tougher now .
you &apos;re smarter about things .
is that good or bad ?
probably neither-- just necessary .
and you .
you &apos;re nothing like four years ago .
i thought you were a jerk .
damn it .
i forgot .
i think she &apos;s on bill maher tonight .
who ?
therese .
you two seemed to be hitting it off .
all that ... breast humor , i guess .
well , that sounds like pure pleasure .
yep . going from office to office ,
arguing with the fcc .
i personally stripped for each and every one of them .
and how did that go over ?
well , commissioner gill took pictures ,
but he said it was for educational purposes .
no . no , don &apos;t .
and commissioner bix ...
oh , i don &apos;t know .
she slipped me her number , but ,
you know , that can mean anything .
and did you settle anything ?
yes , we did .
no more censorship .
anywhere . ever .
these breasts can do anything when they set their minds to it .
i read about your old boss .
florrick .
he &apos;s got a tricky race going on up there .
you like him ?
i do . he &apos;s a good guy .
not easy being a good guy in that town .
your mother sent me something you wrote .
about ... plea bargains .
negotiation techniques .
with a human face .
right . it was smart .
i didn &apos;t understand all of it ,
but what i understood was ...
smart .
thank you .
cary .
how are you doing ?
i &apos;m good .
you ?
i &apos;m good , i guess .
i don &apos;t know how long any of us have ,
but i &apos;m good .
what do you mean ?
nothing . i just ...
i want to say something before it &apos;s too late .
i &apos;m proud of you .
and i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry that ...
we haven &apos;t been in touch .
what do you mean , &quot; too late &quot; ?
nothing . i &apos;m just talking . i ...
i think that we should ...
talk at some point .
dad , what is going on ?
i &apos;m so sorry to interrupt , cary . mr. agos .
what &apos;s wrong ?
uh , we have a problem .
commissioner martinez canceled .
he canceled ?
till when ?
no time .
damn it .
will and diane would like us to come back .
it &apos;s the bill maher thing .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re thinking .
so sorry , mr. agos .
well , you should , uh , go and ...
we &apos;ll talk soon .
dad , call me .
don &apos;t worry . i will .
so maddie hayward is not the campaign innocent she pretends to be .
we spoke to the neighborhood watch ,
and they said they &apos;ve seen indira starr &apos;s car there
for the last month .
before she went to synth magazine ?
so maddie &apos;s been playing us ?
that would make sense .
okay . things have just gotten ugly .
jim , get me everything you can on maddie . kalinda ...
no , thanks .
wait , where you going ?
i have a job , eli . look , you knew this was temporary .
what are you doing ?
this is for alicia
as much as for peter .
nice try , but no .
yes ?
you &apos;re selling us to preston .
i &apos;m ...
considering your options .
your options .
we don &apos;t have any options .
you had six years of options .
so y @-@ you &apos;re punishing us ?
i &apos;m trying to keep you from liquidation .
by destroying us ?
by selling us off in pieces ?
no . by doing what i do :
by looking where the money is and where it isn &apos;t .
this is not a subtle business , ms. lockhart .
there is either money in the wallet or there isn &apos;t .
and when there isn &apos;t , wishing there is won &apos;t make it so .
how was d.c. ?
good .
actually ...
it wasn &apos;t good .
oh , sorry .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just work .
how was interviewing ?
fine . hey , thanks for calling armstrong &amp; hayes .
how did that go ?
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s a job there .
what did they say ?
there &apos;s no job there .
but they said there was .
yes , they lied .
why would they do that ?
because you &apos;re pretty ,
and they didn &apos;t want to say no to you .
okay .
people aren &apos;t mean-- they &apos;re just polite liars .
you went back on the job market after how many years away ?
13 , but i &apos;m not a fair comparison .
the job market &apos;s a lot harder now .
how many interviews did you have before you got this ?
five . but i knew someone . here .
do you know anyone , laura ?
anyone who could help you ?
any connections ?
probably ? i don &apos;t know , but ...
it &apos;s just the way it is . people ...
hire people they know .
it &apos;s not wrong .
it just is .
so you need my help ?
we do .
it &apos;s in your interest , david .
you hate burl preston as much as we do .
he &apos;s not so bad .
david .
burl preston is trying to buy this firm
in order to control you .
do you want to be controlled ?
no . but i don &apos;t want to be controlled by you either .
and if we promised you wouldn &apos;t be ?
well , i &apos;d be open to discussing .
as long as my capital contribution was part of it .
cary ?
hi . i thought you were heading back .
uh ... i @-@ i was . i @-@ i am .
i &apos;m in chicago .
dad ...
what were you trying to say at breakfast ?
dad .
whatever it is , i can handle it .
look , it &apos;s very ... hard to talk about it , son .
your mother thinks that i should wait .
dad , i am here .
and i &apos;m listening .
all right .
do you know ...
senator byers of illinois ?
yeah .
i have a chance to work as her press secretary ,
but i need someone to put in a good word with her .
now , i know that her best friend is
diane lockhart at your firm ,
and i was hoping that you might ask her
to put in that ... good word .
that &apos;s what you wanted to talk about ?
yes .
and that &apos;s it ?
yes , but ... it &apos;s a lot , son .
i know .
and it would be very helpful because ...
senator byers depends a lot on personal recommendations .
and i could talk to martinez for you , if ...
that would be helpful .
dad , i got to go . they need me .
so , you &apos;ll ... do it ?
you &apos;ll ... ask diane lockhart ?
i don &apos;t know . let me ... let me think about it .
son , it would be very helpful .
well , i said i &apos;d think about it .
come again ?
they are saying that i have a mark ...
on my penis shaped like brazil .
i ...
yeah .
what does he want me to say ?
well , that &apos;s a difficult one .
&quot; no &quot; would be the obvious answer .
right . but ...
maybe mixed with some outrage .
yeah , i don &apos;t do outrage well these days .
how about laughter ?
well ... that would be easier .
good . thank you .
that &apos;s okay .
did you fill cary &apos;s position at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
no , not yet .
why ?
are you going to ?
well , someday when i have time .
there &apos;s someone ...
i think you should consider .
an ex @-@ military lawyer .
a captain . you &apos;d like her .
really ?
yeah .
do you mind considering her ?
i don &apos;t .
do you mind talking to the press ?
nope .
good .
it &apos;s a deal .
thanks .
you , too .
bye .
well , you two are cheerful .
we &apos;ve been frozen out .
the last fcc commissioner
doesn &apos;t want to hear us .
it &apos;s worse .
i made a few calls , and commissioner martinez
is still meeting with parents against indecency .
great .
he doesn &apos;t want to meet with you guys ,
but he &apos;s still meeting the opposition tomorrow at 6 : 00 .
one thing we could try ...
yes ?
we go .
go where ?
martinez at 6 : 00 .
we were disinvited .
we never got the message .
we know he wanted to hear
from both parents against indecency and us ,
and we never got the disinvite .
you crash it .
no , this is the new me .
smell my perfume ; it &apos;s called accommodation .
oh , it &apos;s nice .
thanks .
i &apos;ll catch up with you .
so you &apos;re not going to call ?
you &apos;re going to ignore your own father ?
yep .
i only need one call to diane lockhart .
and i only needed one call on my birthday ,
one call when i was out of work .
did you know i was the youngest deputy state &apos;s attorney ever ?
did you know that ?
we don &apos;t do that , cary .
other families gush .
you know how i pay a compliment to you now ?
by needing something from you .
dad .
no ... no .
a few years ago i &apos;d jump at the chance to impress you ,
but it &apos;s over .
i won &apos;t be calling you again .
my loss .
i &apos;m so sorry , i didn &apos;t get the message . cary ?
my gosh , no , i didn &apos;t either .
y @-@ you were canceling ?
yes , just a scheduling logjam .
well , now that we &apos;re all here ...
... it seems only fair .
all i wanted to do
was to make women aware of breast cancer .
and disrobing was making them aware ?
would i do it that way again ? no ,
but women needed to see something memorable ,
something to provoke them .
i &apos;m impressed , ms. dodd .
thank you , commissioner .
but what i have trouble reconciling
is this new therese with the therese
that told this joke :
&quot; rape is never funny .
unless you &apos;re raped by a clown . &quot;
how is this funny , ms. dodd ?
sir , that wasn &apos;t part of the original act .
i understand that ,
but i find myself confused by ms. dodd &apos;s sense of humor .
do you know that every 45 seconds ,
there is another sexual assault in america ?
so i &apos;m not sure how rape is funny .
the joke isn &apos;t about rape , sir .
it &apos;s about a ridiculous juxtaposition .
but it makes light of rape , doesn &apos;t it ?
shall i read it again ?
i think , sir , you &apos;re trying to make a point
by putting ms. dodd on the spot .
sir , we didn &apos;t come ...
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s not funny , commissioner .
therese .
what ?
he &apos;s right .
rape is never funny ,
and the association of clowns and rape is just offensive ,
and i feel terrible that i wrote it .
thank you , ma &apos;am ,
but then i find myself asking ,
why do you tell these jokes ?
because i have a potty mouth .
are you making fun of me , ms. dodd ?
no .
never ...
because that &apos;s why we have standards--
to protect the viewers from indecency like this .
well , if the question is about protecting viewers ,
they voted with their remotes .
there are more viewers watching the show than ever .
okay , so i must ask you , ms. dodd ,
will you sign a pledge that you will never do
anything like this on tv again ?
ms. dodd ?
i think that &apos;s a yes .
i was in the jag corps for 12 years
and before that , i attended sls .
sls ?
s @-@ stanford law .
oh , i thought that was military jargon .
no .
i grew up in california-- huntington beach .
was your dad in the military ?
no , a professor of neurobiology at irvine .
brothers ?
no , two sisters , though .
why did you enlist , then ?
i don &apos;t know . they needed lawyers .
well , we &apos;re not really short @-@ staffed at the moment ,
but we &apos;re always looking ,
so we &apos;ll keep this resume on file .
have you tried the public defenders &apos; office ?
they &apos;re always in need of ...
mr. florrick , hello .
hi , geneva .
and you must be captain hellinger .
oh , yes , sir .
wonderful to meet you .
you &apos;re looking for a job , huh ?
i am , sir .
and you know how little we pay ?
i &apos;ve heard rumors .
you could live on that ?
i tend to be frugal .
well , that &apos;s good .
when can you begin ?
now , i mean , if you want .
that &apos;s great .
here &apos;s your first case :
breaking and entering .
geneva will set you up with a cubicle . welcome aboard .
thank you so much .
um , thank you for your help .
your honor , there is still the question of damages .
no , there is the question of
whether your negotiations have borne fruit .
we made an effort to reach such a settlement , your honor ,
but the results depend on something yet to be decided .
mr. preston is being coy .
we agreed to argue in front of the fcc on the network &apos;s behalf ,
and if the fcc decided favorably ,
this lawsuit would go away .
i see . and the fcc hasn &apos;t decided ?
not yet , but we believe this suit should be dismissed
on the basis of an absence of damages .
damages have already been established , your honor--
the many affiliates dropping our show .
yes , but mr. preston recently argued in front of the fcc
that there has been a corresponding rise in viewership--
a rise large enough to more than offset the affiliate loss .
that was an argument in another venue .
your honor ,
this suit is an attempt to punish therese , that &apos;s all .
there are no actual damages here ,
and this suit should be dismissed .
would you care for some water ?
no .
my firm will absorb the debt of lockhart / gardner
and pay out existing capital contributions
of existing equity partners ,
but all severance packages will be the responsibility
of the existing partners .
yes , and you agree to honor the contracts of existing partners .
only up to a year of the purchase date .
that &apos;s fine .
the , the current lease will be subject to ...
hello , burl .
david ... what can we do for you ?
oh , i &apos;m just watching .
continue .
mr. lee , this is a private matter .
it &apos;s far from private .
i &apos;m just waiting for my emancipation .
go ahead .
your emancipation ?
yes . this firm has a stranglehold on me ,
but as soon as you purchase it , i &apos;m free .
hallelujah .
you &apos;re not free .
you &apos;re committed to lockhart / gardner .
no , the partners just rewrote my contract .
if this firm is sold
or absorbed , i am free to leave .
they can &apos;t do that .
yes , they can .
you can veto their hiring decisions .
you can &apos;t veto a nonfinancial side agreement
in a partnership contract .
the firm is still in fine shape .
no , thank you .
good luck with this place .
unfortunately
they enjoy intrigue more than they do making money .
you told your husband to hire me ?
no .
he hired me .
congratulations .
you didn &apos;t say anything to him ?
well , i said you were a good lawyer .
okay .
this is all new to me .
what , friends didn &apos;t help friends in the military ?
they did , but never me .
well , baptism by fire .
yes ?
you &apos;re cutting your own throats !
do you know how hard it is to find a suitor like that ? !
yes , that &apos;s why we did it .
you &apos;re losing this firm .
is that a threat ?
take it any way you want , but you are losing this firm .
mr. hayden , you should take a step back .
you &apos;ve obviously become too invested in our firm .
you don &apos;t know me .
i don &apos;t step back .
we don &apos;t either .
then get ready to crash .
so , i just heard the fcc isn &apos;t going to fine the network .
yeah , yeah , you &apos;re off the hook .
good .
i have to head out to l.a. , so i wanted to say thank you .
have a good trip .
i will .
i &apos;m not great with byes , so bye .
what &apos;d she say ?
good @-@ bye .
that &apos;s it ?
yeah .
she didn &apos;t say anything else ?
no , why ?
well , why did she kiss you yesterday ?
she &apos;s a comedian .
i &apos;ve spent the last week
with my lawyer , trying desperately not to say anything
about brazil and penises .
i suppose there are worse birthmarks to have .
like greece .
i mean , who wants a penis that &apos;s always in recession ?
my lawyer says , it really only looks like brazil
when it &apos;s erect .
