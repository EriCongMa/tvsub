oh my god , that &apos;s so freaking funny .
i know , right ?
what ?
dad just wrote another classic one . tell her .
i don &apos;t know about &quot; classic , &quot; but here we go .
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for a two @-@ story house , &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m your man . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll tell you one story before you buy it &quot;
&quot; and then another story after . &quot;
no , you didn &apos;t !
tonight is the s.c.a.r.b ..
the southern california annual realtor &apos;s banquet .
i think they know what it is .
it &apos;s the mother of all
residential @-@ real @-@ estate banquets .
now , for the last five years , gil thorpe has hosted ,
but as luck would have it ,
he &apos;s having a sketchy @-@ looking polyp remove .
so they &apos;ve asked me to ... &quot; phil in . &quot;
see what i did ?
oh , yeah .
&quot; phil . &quot;
you think i should open with that ?
you betcha . you should .
phil is gonna bomb .
it &apos;s not that he &apos;s not fun . he is so fun .
he &apos;s just not funny .
it &apos;s probably my fault ,
because i laugh at all of his jokes .
with my mouth not with my eyes .
&quot; i see the great realtor margaret wilson is here , &quot;
&quot; looking more curvaceous than ever . &quot;
&quot; talk about your balloon payments . &quot;
gloria , do we have to keep
this colombia / brazil soccer game ?
yes , i haven &apos;t seen it yet .
it &apos;s been sitting in there for five months .
i mean , i can tell you who wins .
and what about this two @-@ hour
&quot; antiques roadshow &quot; ?
i &apos;ll watch it today .
fine . i &apos;m gonna play some golf .
no . what about mirabel &apos;s daughter &apos;s quinceanera ?
i honestly didn &apos;t get any of that .
mirabel . she works for you .
okay .
her daughter , rosalba , is celebrating her quinceanera ,
her 15th birthday .
she invited us . you just going to ignore it .
of course not . i get this all the time .
i throw it on my secretary &apos;s desk ,
and she sends them an omaha steak .
ay , jay .
what ? !
manny &apos;s right .
the quinceanera is very important in the latin culture .
the moment the father dances with his little princess .
ay , i remember my own father holding my hand .
there wasn &apos;t a dry eye in the cartel .
but these people don &apos;t want me there .
see , they &apos;re just being polite .
i &apos;m the boss .
that &apos;s what you tell yourself
so you can stay above them .
you just throw them an &quot; obama &quot; steak
and run to the golf course .
i &apos;m not trying to stay above them .
i just don &apos;t think
i have to go all &quot; arriba , arriba &quot; with them .
because you &apos;re better than them ?
no , of course not .
i mean , i &apos;m better than some of them .
do you even know these people , jay , hmm ?
or they &apos;re just the backs you step on ?
i know you like to make me out as an elitist ,
but the truth is , i &apos;m close with these people .
then prove it . just go to the party .
fine . one hour . you drive .
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want to give my valet ticket to the wrong guy ,
have you all over me .
ay , jay .
where do you keep popping out from ? !
so , cam has started working out again ,
which is -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s great .
he &apos;s feeling good about himself ,
and i want him to be healthy ,
so it is all good .
except for one thing .
knock , knock .
look who &apos;s there .
maybe there &apos;s a person in this world
who looks good in bike shorts .
but my boyfriend is not that person .
and i @-@ i can &apos;t tell him because he gets incredibly sensitive
about even the tiniest comment concerning his physique .
hey , i think i &apos;m gonna take this spin class tomorrow morning .
oh , sure .
oh , i get it . message received .
i didn &apos;t say anything !
okay , can &apos;t you just run like a normal person ?
what ? it &apos;s troga .
it &apos;s what ?
you never heard of troga ?
i hate it when you do that .
what ?
&quot; you &apos;ve never heard of troga ? &quot;
&quot; you never tried octopus ? &quot;
&quot; you never did this amazing thing &quot;
&quot; i just discovered yesterday
but i pretend like i &apos;ve done my whole life ? &quot;
so , troga is treadmill yoga .
it &apos;s de rigueur .
it &apos;s de @-@ dorky .
what is your deal today ?
i &apos;m sorry . phil is hosting that thing tonight ,
and -- and he &apos;s been writing jokes .
ooh , yikes .
i know .
and i &apos;m worried he &apos;s gonna humiliateself
in front of all those important people .
i can &apos;t say anything because --
no , no . i get it . i get it . i get it .
because it would hurt him even more coming from you .
yeah .
you know , i &apos;m kind of going through something similar
with cam right now .
why ?
he &apos;s started exercising again .
well , that &apos;s good for him .
yeah . he &apos;s wearing bike shorts .
that &apos;s bad for you .
and i &apos;m the last person who can say anything ,
because he &apos;s ...
yeah .
okay , wait . no , no . all right .
you know the movie &quot; strangers on a train &quot; ?
hm , i never saw it .
you &apos;ve never seen &quot; strangers on a -- &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . great film .
but it &apos;s these guys
who both discover that they want someone out of their lives .
uh @-@ huh .
so one of the guys proposes the perfect crime .
they will do each other &apos;s murders .
we should do that .
all right ,
so i would tell cam to lose the bike shorts ?
keeping me out of it .
and i tell phil to lose the jokes .
i like it . i &apos;m in .
all right ! - i am in !
hey , mackenzie . stop it . it &apos;s alex .
hey , so i was thinking later we &apos;d --
oh , no . whatever you want .
call me later !
or i &apos;ll call you later , or --
so , who &apos;s mackenzie ?
you don &apos;t know her .
oh , i know mackenzie .
cute . popular .
i am mackenzie .
i invented mackenzie .
and the way she &apos;s making my sister run around ...
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s kind of funny , but ...
i can &apos;t have it . it &apos;s bad for the family .
what are you doing ? i was about to call --
mackenzie ? yeah , i know .
now shut up and let me help you .
the world is divided into two groups --
cool girls and girls like you .
and you have been given a rare opportunity
to move from the former to the latter .
the latter to the former .
whatever . oh , my god . you &apos;re such a geek .
now , do you want to be smart , or do you want to be popular ?
i think i want to be popular .
of course you do .
you just can &apos;t be so obvious about it .
you &apos;ve given mackenzie way too much power ,
and you need to take some of that power back .
it &apos;s her .
give me the phone .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna say --
&quot; hey , mackenzie . i &apos;m busy . call me back later . &quot;
then you hang up.- no way !
then you &apos;re not getting the phone back .
just give it to me .
&quot; hey , mackenzie . i &apos;m busy .
call me back later . &quot; then you hang up .
i can &apos;t .
do it .
no !
do it !
okay ! damn you .
hey , mackenzie . i &apos;m busy . call me back later .
that was hard .
if it was easy , everyone would be popular .
knock knock !
come on in ! it &apos;s open !
i just wanted to drop off these old baby clothes for lily .
oh , that &apos;s right . you &apos;re so sweet .
i hope i didn &apos;t come at a bad time .
not at all .
i was just deciding where to take lily for our bike ride --
the lake or the park .
i &apos;m leaning towards the park .
i can see that .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
you guys are a touch old class .
well , it is a big night for you , so .
french .
those guys .
so , have you given any thought to what you might say ?
oh , actually , i &apos;m trying not to think about my act right now .
i &apos;m kind of fighting the old butterflies , to be honest .
that &apos;s normal .
i hear the jonas brothers get scared before every concert .
not kevin ? the guy &apos;s a rock .
especially kevin .
i can &apos;t believe i ever bought this for alex .
i wish somebody had said something .
oh , come on . that was probably cute 10 years ago .
no , no . it never was .
and you know --
i &apos;m the exact same way about my clothes .
most of the time , great .
but every now and again , there &apos;s that one outfit .
i just wish somebody would be honest with me and say ,
&quot; what you &apos;re wearing is inappropriate . &quot;
do you know what i mean ?
i think i do , claire .
i think i do .
and my answer is yes .
okay .
i would love to dress you .
no , it -- i don &apos;t want you to dress me .
no .
and ... i owe it to you to be honest ,
so i &apos;m just gonna say
that you need to lose the bicycle shorts .
excuse me ?
they &apos;re not working for you , cam .
please don &apos;t take this personally .
i mean , nobody looks good in bike shorts .
i just -- i feel that i owe it to you to be honest .
so , we &apos;re good , right ?
we &apos;re great .
we &apos;re great .
we &apos;re great .
oh , great .
okay .
you should probably just show yourself out .
i hear -- i hear some crying down the hallway .
look at that . that &apos;s a good dad .
because you &apos;ve got a baby ,
and you hear every little sound .
i wouldn &apos;t have -- i wouldn &apos;t have even noticed ...
crying .
uh , okay . all right .
all you need to know about this one
is that skip woosnum is a well @-@ known realtor
and he &apos;s old .
got it .
skip woosnum . realtor . old .
here we go .
i &apos;m not saying realtor skip woosnum is old ,
but the first property he ever sold ...
was a cave .
you &apos;re not , uh ...
not laughing .
why aren &apos;t you laughing , uncle mitchell ?
&apos;cause he doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s funny ,
or maybe -- maybe you don &apos;t think i &apos;m funny .
is that what you &apos;re saying , mitch ?
no , it &apos;s ...
i just got it !
oh . cave !
that one &apos;s kind of a thinker .
yes !
there he is .
all right , now .
knock it off , jay .
you don &apos;t know anyone &apos;s name here .
are you kidding me ?
carlos !
lucky guess .
i &apos;m lucky only one turned around .
listen -- i need a favor .
i overestimated the number of people i know at this party .
so you go around , introduce yourself ,
and i &apos;ll hear the names .
you realize you &apos;re asking me
to help prove my own mother wrong .
i &apos;ll pay two bucks per introduction .
all right , well , that &apos;s ramona .
she &apos;s crazy for bingo .
ramona .
gloria !
stop being such a snob .
come over and meet my friend julio and his wife --
uh , i &apos;m sorry . your name again ?
kay ?
i think you &apos;re really gonna hit it off with kay !
i mean , she &apos;s gonna tell me how to dress ? !
she ought to stick to things she knows more about ,
like overcooking salmon .
okay , wait .
so , she actually said
that you don &apos;t look good in bicycle shorts ?
yes .
&quot; you don &apos;t look good in bicycle shorts . &quot;
madness .
oh , and here she is .
okay , you know what ? i can &apos;t be here .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m going out for some air .
yes . yes , go . this -- this could get ugly .
hello , claire .
you are a gutless weasel .
oh , yeah . no .
i heard what you said to my boyfriend .
you told phil he was hysterical !
you said he was this generation &apos;s richard pryor !
well , i am not the one that you need to apologize to .
what are you babbling about ? you owe me a murder .
okay , claire , i c -- i couldn &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t crush phil &apos;s dreams .
we had a deal . i told cam about the bike shorts .
no ! no !
the deal was to get cam to take off the bike shorts .
but guess what -- he is still in the stupid bike shorts .
can i call you back ?
turns out cam was here the whole time ,
and he just heard everything i said .
ooh . did he just run into the bedroom and cry ?
oh , yes , &apos; cause that &apos;s what all gay men do .
we all dissolve into --
yes . that is what he did .
there are challenging moments in every marriage .
um ... having to tell your husband that he &apos;s not funny
so that he won &apos;t humiliate himself
has to be one of the toughest .
so i went a different way .
stop talking .
i just need some time for this wound to become a scar .
i &apos;m sorry i got claire involved ,
but -- and this is not a criticism ,
but sometimes you can be a little sensitive
about your ... appearance .
well , this is a criticism --
sometimes you can be insensitive about everything .
i just can &apos;t -- i just feel like
our relationship &apos;s strong enough to survive a little candor .
i mean , look , you could tell me
if there &apos;s something about me you &apos;d like to change .
i hate your beard .
well , you had that bullet in the chamber .
i never said anything because i never wanted to hurt you ...
but i &apos;ve always found your beard off @-@ putting .
see ? hurts .
mitchell ?
mitchell , get back here !
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m shaving off the beard .
seriously ?
yeah , well , the man i love doesn &apos;t like it , so off it goes .
well , good .
good .
great .
great . okay .
one ...
two ...
three .
wait !
the fact that you &apos;re willing to do it is enough for me .
i love your beard .
i love that when you drink cappuccino , you get foam in it
and when you &apos;re nervous , your little ...
hairs twitch .
well , you couldn &apos;t have told me before took a notch out ?
i &apos;m sorry . i -- i -- listen .
i know ... i can be touchy about ... this .
but you &apos;re this amazing @-@ looking guy , and --
i am not amazing -
really ?
i wouldn &apos;t change anything .
you should know that every day ,
i wake up very grateful to have you in my life .
i &apos;m the one who got lucky , handsome .
maybe i just don &apos;t show it enough .
well , you can make it up to me by doing my shoulders .
sure .
i meant a massage . what are you saying ?
oh , mitchell . mitchell .
it &apos;s mackenzie .
again .
she wants me to come to this party she &apos;s throwing .
she texted me earlier .
you texted her back , right ?
no .
i &apos;m ...
proud ?
tell her you &apos;ll try and come .
right .
and then when she says --
haley ...
i got this .
who &apos;s this ?
brilliant .
no , i didn &apos;t see it . i get a lot of texts .
i have a sister .
when &apos;s the party ?
i &apos;ll try and come .
you know , i &apos;m kind of busy . i have a life .
you know , stuff .
homework .
uh @-@ oh .
i mean , not homework .
it &apos;s not work if you love it .
oh , god . hang up . hang up .
shut up !

drop the phone and kick it over here !
um , i have to go .
i @-@ i &apos;ll call you later .
or you call me later .
love you !
aah ! aah !
aah ! aah !
they were right in here !
i know , and we looked everywhere , honey ,
so just calm down .
are you kidding me ? &quot; calm down &quot; ?
in one minute ,
i &apos;m gonna be standing up there like ...
like a ...
oh , my god . i have no material at all .
okay . you &apos;re gonna be fine . you don &apos;t need jokes .
listen to me , honey .
get up there . be your charming self .
make the introductions from your heart , and get out .
you &apos;re gonna -- you &apos;re gonna be amazing , okay ?
phil dunphy .
go . go .
good evening .
i would not be here tonight
if not for the hard work
of the s.c.a.r.b. board of trustees ...
i didn &apos;t have my jokes .
what choice does a guy have but to play it straight ?
... the support of my family ,
and gil thorpe &apos;s colon .
but phil dunphy is no straight guy .
so many giants of residential real estate here tonight .
and , of course , j.j. mccubbin .
i &apos;m not saying j.j. is small ,
but in the realty section , he was described as &quot; charming . &quot;
mark simon , you out there ?

you &apos;ve never met any of these people .
you don &apos;t know anyone in this room .
vamos , jay .
i &apos;m not leaving before the father / daughter dance .
and &quot; these people , &quot; as you call them ,
are not just employees .
they &apos;re mi familia , or &quot; my family . &quot;
i know what &quot; mi familia &quot; is , jay .
oh , i was afraid of this .
no . jay . no .
thank you . thank you .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen . thank you very much .
i &apos;m gonna make this brief .
i know a lot of you out there don &apos;t even know who i am .
as my lovely wife , gloria , pointed out ,
that &apos;s my fault , not yours .
i &apos;m jay pritchett ,
el jefe .
listen -- on this very , very happy occasion ,
i &apos;d like to pick up the tab on the bar .
you know , when i started this company ...
... the first thing that i --
what ?
oh , right . right , now . good . yeah .
this is not about me .
this is about a very special young lady
and the man who loves her more than anyone else on earth .
isn &apos;t that lovely ?
that &apos;s a beautiful , beautiful thing .
you know , i &apos;m reminded
of when i used to dance with my little girl .
but not like that .
slow down , there , muchacho .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
what , are you applauding this ? you &apos;re applauding this ?

v @-@ v @-@ vamos !
i mean , honey , i am not kidding when i tell you
there was a woman next to me gasping for breath .
seriously , you were so freaking funny , phil .
i have seen professional comedians
who could never have done that .
you were unbeliev--
i know it was you , claire . you stole my index cards .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i thought i was protecting you .
and if my plan had been successful ,
i would have robbed you of the greatest night ever .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m awful .
you &apos;re not awful .
mm ...
claire ...
i love that you &apos;re looking out for me ,
and know why you worry about me .
but i knew i had this tonight .
i know .
sometimes i just think my job
is to make sure you guys don &apos;t fall on your faces .
that &apos;s a hard job in the dunphy house .
we fall a lot .
i know .
maybe your real job is to be the person who picks us back up .
nobody does that better than you .
thank you .
alex .
i have no friends .
you &apos;re on the clock .
all right .
what happened ?
oh , my gosh , mom . you &apos;re killing me .
it &apos;s pretty good , right ?

mom does the funniest impression
of that weird lady at the supermarket .
oh , yeah . i know her . let &apos;s hear it .

&quot; it &apos;s cheaper
if you buy two jars of pickles . &quot;
