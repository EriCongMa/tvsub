Ladies, I give you our very own Honolulu Hercules--
Brad Steel!
Come on, let's flash those bills and get some thrills!
Hey, Brad, baby! Over here!
Tina!
Over here!
You guys!
This is crazy!
Relax! You are not gonna be
"Mrs. Bob Johnson" till Sunday.
Okay, stop it.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
To Bob Johnson...
Oh my god, that guy was so hot.
All of you have to swear
you cannot tell Bob about any of this.
Uh, pictures don't lie, girlfriend.
You're so nasty!
Tina! You didn't...!
Oops! I just tweeted it.
Oh, my God!
I'm kidding.
Relax!
Bob the Snob is never gonna find out.
There. Gone.
All right, girls, where do you want to go?
Another strip club.
What do you say-- Danzibar?
Yes!
Let's get this party started!
*Come on, 'cause I know what I like*
*And you're looking just like my type*
*Let's go for it just for tonight*
*Come on, come on, come on...!*
Oh, my God...
Is everyone okay?
I think so.
Oh, my God, that guy has a gun.
What?
Mick!
Hello?
Mick?
Aloha.
Aloha.
I see you met Brittany.
I see you haven't changed.
Shoot me if I ever do.
God, it's good to see you, Steve.
Been too long, man.
Come on, sit down.
Put your dogs up.
I'll buy you a drink.
So, uh, I hear you're running some kind of a task force now.
Glad to see your talents haven't gone to waste.
Same goes for you, pal.
Looks like the private sector's paying well.
Yeah, well, after 25 years in Navy Intel,
it was either hang a shingle
or buy a rocking chair,
so... I hung a shingle.
That's why I came to see you, Mick.
I want to hire you for your services.
I need a full surveillance package on this target.
Who is she?
It's my mother.
Kid, you don't need a P.I.,
you need a therapist.
Trust me, she's not your average mom.
She's a former government agent.
She disappeared from my life 20 years ago
because of an assignment, now she's back...
says she's changed.
I don't believe her.
She goes dark a few hours every day.
She racks up too many miles on the odometer.
I want to know what she's up to.
Well, why come to me?
You've got the resources to handle this.
No, I don't want my people involved.
Besides, there's no one better than you
at recon and surveillance.
Full surveillance package means I'm on her 24/7.
That's audio, stills, video...
Good chance I'll see your mother naked.
Okay, you know, I didn't need to know that.
Just saying. Just saying.
McGarrett.
On the way.
Name is Thomas Hoapili, 46 years old,
ran a local wholesale fish market,
widowed, one daughter--
Maggie Hoapili, 21 years old,
lives in Miliani.
All right, what about the witnesses in the other car--
they see anything?
All they saw were two people in hoodies
put three slugs in our vic
before dumping the weapon and fleeing the scene.
Max confirms that was the cause of death.
Okay, so Thomas was alive before the accident.
Question is, what was he doing in the trunk?
Maybe a kidnapping gone bad?
No, why kill your bargaining chip?
No, he's right.
If this was a K and R,
shooters would've fled the scene,
picked up Thomas another day.
What else do we know?
Uh, we ran the car they were driving;
it was reported stolen two days ago
from a rental car company at Honolulu International.
HPD's processing.
Okay, what about the murder weapon?
It is a Smith & Wesson .45.
Fong's working his magic right now.
All right.
This accident happened two blocks
away from the H1 on-ramp.
I'm thinking these guys were trying to get out of town,
drive him to a remote location,
kill him there-- this was an execution.
so Fong ran ballistics on the murder weapon
and pulled a partial print.
Says he's got something we need to see.
Hey, Charlie, what do you got?
That partial I pulled got a hit in AFIS.
Who is it?
I'll show you.
You're not gonna like it.
Kamekona?!
Look, I got nothing to do with this.
I loved Thomas.
He was my cousin.
I gotta go see Maggie...
Hey, hey, sit down.
Chin and Kono are going over there.
Right now you need to tell us what's going on.
I don't know. I swear.
Look, Thomas and I, we was tight.
He the only was waiting for me
when I got out of Halawa.
Only one believed in me when nobody in the family would.
Gave me money to start my first shave ice stand.
I owe him everything.
You guys are sweating the wrong guy.
Okay. That's fine.
But you got to explain to me why your prints
are all over our murder weapon.
Killers must've took it from Thomas--
a gun that I gave him.
You... you gave him a gun?
For protection.
Protection from what?
He didn't say.
Ah, see, I don't believe that.
It's the truth.
My cousin needed help,
I help him.
That's the way it works.
You understand that, Steve.
You do know that trafficking in illegal firearms...
All right.
You think of anything else,
you give us a call, all right?
Absolutely.
You gonna get in the car?
No, I'm not gonna get in the car
until you tell me what is going on
in that goofy head of yours.
Excuse me?
The, uh, shrimp king knew something
and you just let him go.
That's right.
Why?
Trust me.
Goofy head, huh?
Stop gloating and drive. Let's go.
Go, go, go!
You're following me.
No, I wasn't.
Oh, really?
Well, I suggest you try something
with a little more fiber,
because, clearly, you're full of crap.
Okay, all right, all right, all right, guilty as charged.
I was just
looking for an opportunity to say hello.
What, were you gonna ask my help deciding
what cantaloupes are ripe?
Close, close.
Actually, it's grape related.
I was... I was going to ask for a wine recommendation.
Ah, wine recommendation.
You look like the kind of woman
who appreciates the finer things in life,
and so I ask you,
which of these do you think goes better
with a grilled branzino?
All right, branzino is a fish,
so you're gonna want to go with a white,
not a red, and I got to say,
that is probably the worst pickup line I have ever heard.
Oh, well.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
All right.
Let's make a deal.
You take me out to lunch,
and I will tell you everything I know about wine pairings.
Gun?
What...
Why did my father need a gun?
We were hoping you could tell us.
Can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt him?
No.
Everybody loved him.
My father didn't have any enemies.
Was he doing anything unusual?
Anything out of the ordinary?
Nothing was out of the ordinary when it came to my dad.
What do you mean?
He had a routine.
You could set your clock by it.
Monday through Saturday,
he opened this place 4:30 in the morning,
closed at 9:00 at night.
Then it was dinner,
whatever novel he was reading,
then off to bed.
Sunday we went to church,
and Tuesday nights, we'd go hit golf balls
at the Ala Wai driving range.
And what about last night?
When I left work, he was still in his office.
Tell me about this commendation from HPD.
Oh, last year someone tried to rob us.
My dad took his gun away and held him
until the police showed up.
Was he ever worried about payback?
Do you think that's why my father was murdered?
Hands on the hood.
Get them on the hood.
What's up, buddy?
Sup?
I don't know, you tell me.
Wow, now, this is insult to injury.
This guy's got The Guns of Navarone.
Let me see your hands.
This is obviously not gonna work.
You got a bike chain in the trunk or what?
Thanks, brother. That hurt my feelings.
Turn around.
Hey, you want to explain this?
Why'd you lie to us?
I didn't lie, technically.
What do you mean, "technically"?
I just wasn't completely forthcoming.
Okay, well, now's your chance to, uh,
be completely forthcoming.
This lolo, Quentin Thorne,
tried to rob my cousin last year.
Thomas got him put away.
He was thinking his brother, Eddie,
was looking for revenge.
Well, why would Thomas think that?
He seen Eddie hanging around the fish market
the last few weeks.
Why didn't he just call the cops?
He did. Cops told him
if Eddie doesn't threaten him,
there's nothing they can do.
Okay, so what, Thomas came to you for a gun?
I was taking care of ohana.
His daughter, Maggie...
Thomas was the only one she had.
Now the kid got nobody.
All because Eddie Thorne got his payback.
All right, so you thought you'd come down here
and get a little payback yourself, is that right?
No, no, no, I just was gonna scare him,
make him confess,
make a citizen's arrest.
A citizen's arrest.
That's good. You know how stupid that sounds?
In retrospect, yes.
I had to do something.
Yeah, but this ain't it, buddy. Okay?
You do this, you're gonna end up in prison,
and we do not want that.
I'm touched.
Oh, don't-don't give me a puppy-dog sad eyes, please.
Okay? You're not off the hook.
You're on house arrest till this is over.
I've got an island to feed, brah.
Okay, then you are on shrimp truck lockdown
till otherwise advised. Is that clear?
Like the sweet waters of Hanauma Bay.
So which one's Eddie's house?
Second one on the left with all the tacky lawn trolls.
Clear.
What do you got?
I have photography.
I got a logbook.
"Pier 38."
Dates and times last couple weeks.
Oh, look at this.
Looks like Eddie was keeping an eye on Thomas,
working out a good time to grab him.
Hey, you Eddie Thorne?
Seriously?
Oh, dude, you broke Chucky.
Yeah.
You killed Thomas Hoapili.
You're under arrest.
Just 'cause I had pictures of the guy
doesn't mean I killed him.
No, I guess not,
but Thomas did put your brother, Quentin,
in prison and revenge is a pretty strong motive.
Yeah, you'd be right if I gave a damn about my brother.
Dumb punk deserves to be in jail.
That market job was a bad play.
He's a good liar, too. That's a survival skill.
You're gonna need it when you get to prison.
I'm not going down for this murder.
You don't get a vote.
Look, man, I was just trying to rob the guy.
'Cause it went so well for your brother?
Quentin liked to stick up convenience stores for pocket change.
That market did big money.
Some of those tuna go for six figures.
Quentin was out of his league.
He didn't have a plan for that job, I did.
So you did your homework.
Yeah, you're damn right I did.
I cased that place for weeks.
I clocked every move Hoapili made.
If he hadn't got himself killed,
I'd be set for life.
I got something you need to see.
Okay, so Maggie said her father was still at work
when she left last night, right?
So I pulled the footage from a security camera on pier 38.
Now, that is Thomas Hoapili.
Notice the time stamp.
He closed up shop at 9:15.
But that's not Eddie Thorne, is it?
No, I ran matrix; he's too tall.
The other perp is a female.
Brown hair; five foot, seven.
I got a better look at her.
Their vehicle matches the stolen rental from the crash site,
and both perps match our witness description.
Chin, run that back.
Thomas is empty-handed.
The other two never go back into the store to grab anything
after they take him down.
This wasn't a robbery.
All right, the crash happened at 2:43 A.M., right?
That's right.
Well, this is time-stamped 9:15 P.M.
So what happened in the five and a half hours
before Thomas turned up dead?
Mmm. This was a great choice.
From now on, I only drink pinot noir
from the Willamette Valley.
Well, the best pinots are from Burgundy,
if you can afford it,
but give me a smooth, inexpensive
Oregon pinot any day of the week.
You really do know your wines.
I do.
Lucky I bumped into you.
Well, likewise.
Here's to, um, what, uh, your Hawaiian vacation.
Thank you.
What's so funny?
Uh, no, I just, um,
I can't believe I'm actually dining with royalty.
Do they really call you the Fabric King of Ohio?
Fabric is my life.
For fabrics, drapes, upholstery
there's only one real place to be.
The one and only Fabric King
of Ohio, give us a ring.
Oh, God, that's just awful.
I know, isn't it?
But that little jingle
has kept my family in business for over 75 years.
So, enough about me.
I want to know about you.
What, you mean
when I'm not making wine recommendations?
Yeah, yeah, what do you do?
How do you spend your days?
Well, I was a schoolteacher.
Retired now,
and after 25 years of chalk dust, uh,
I prefer to spend my days outdoors.
That explains your extraordinary figure.
Okay, I think you've really had a little too much to drink.
No, no, no, it's just my Midwestern honesty.
Oh, that's-that's got to be it.
Sorry.
Oh, it's just...
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's the factory; I got to take this.
One of the looms is on the fritz.
Oh, the looms, yes.
Sorry, excuse me.
Absolutely.
Yeah?
Hey, what'd you find?
Nothing.
Subject left the house at approximately 10:30.
Took a walk on the beach.
Got her nails done;
French tips, by the way.
As far as I can see, she's got nothing to hide.
I told you she's good, okay?
You want to find something, you got to dig deeper.
Well, it's your dime, kid.
If my shovel hits something, I'll call you.
Yeah, okay, good.
Problem?
No.
Then why are you staring at me?
You hired somebody to run surveillance on your mother?
Okay, I know what you're gonna say.
Well, what am I gonna say?
That hiring somebody to spy on their mother
is the act of a crazy person.
Uh, yeah, I would've used different words like,
uh, "whack job" or "psychopath."
"Crazy" works, though. It works.
Yeah, I had no choice, Danny, okay?
Have you ever tried speaking to your mother
like a... like a human being,
like normal people do?
What am I going to say?
"Mom, I know you're running
"a covert op. What is it?"
Yeah, that would work.
Oh, okay.
Look, if she's in the game, why don't you confront her?
Right? I mean, don't bring in an outside source.
She finds out that her son put a tail on her,
I promise you... I promise it will end badly.
It's not going to end badly.
This guy wrote the book on surveillance.
My mother is never going to see it coming.
How are the looms?
Oh, just weaving away.
Good. Good to hear.
Oh, I hope you don't mind, I took the liberty
of ordering another bottle of wine.
Well, if I drink any more wine, I might do something I regret.
I hope so.
I confirmed the C.O.D. was multiple gunshot wounds.
However, it's what happened to Mr. Hoapili
prior to being shot that's quite interesting.
Take a look.
A shattered jaw, six broken ribs,
signs of internal bleeding
and a fractured sacroiliac.
That would be a joint in the pelvis.
I knew that.
No, you didn't.
You didn't know it, either.
Okay, uh, if you two are finished,
I'd like to continue.
Max, could all of this have been a result of the accident?
No. The trunk never sustained any damage due to the crash,
so Mr. Hoapili suffered his
extensive trauma elsewhere.
Okay, so he was picked up,
he was beaten, dumped in the trunk like this.
That would be correct.
And the extent of his injuries, left unattended,
would have killed Mr. Hoapili,
whether or not he had been shot.
And then there's this.
These cuts and contusions on his knuckles
are defensive wounds.
Quite severe.
Which can only mean one thing.
Thomas was in a fight.
Not just a fight, but the fight of his life.
Glad to see you're
following Steve's orders and staying put.
I took it to heart.
Working is therapeutic.
Otherwise, I let my emotions get the better of me.
I'm so sorry.
You hungry? I can whip some of these up for you.
No. I'm good. I'm good.
I could use your eyes on something, though.
You recognize them?
I might if you had a better picture.
I wish I did.
These the two that killed my cousin?
Right now they're suspects.
Mind if I keep that?
Show your suspects to my people?
Sure.
But you got to promise
to call us first if you get a name.
I learned my lesson, sistah.
I promise.
Okay.
Take care, Kame.
Yeah, Chin.
You remember when Maggie told us
she and her father went to the driving range?
Yeah, Tuesday nights?
Yeah.
I had HPD canvass all of Thomas's known associates.
The owners of Ala Wai Golf say
they haven't seen Thomas and Maggie there in years.
Kono, if Maggie lied to us
about hitting golf balls with her father,
I wonder what else she told us that wasn't true.
Yeah.
Okay, the albacore's coming in later this afternoon.
Maggie, can we talk to you for a moment?
Do you have any news?
What was your father really doing Tuesday nights?
What are you talking about?
He wasn't hitting golf balls.
What was he really doing?
Uh, would you guys give us a minute?
Thank you.
It would save us a lot of time
if you told us the truth.
I can't tell you.
Look, Maggie,
I know all about wanting
to protect the reputation of your family,
but if your father was mixed up
in something that got him killed,
you need to tell us now.
You know nothing about my father.
You covering for someone else?
If you don't tell us,
we're going to need to bring you in
for impeding a homicide investigation.
All right, if that's the way you want to play it,
that's fine by me.
You can't do this.
Watch me.
Maggie, what is so important
you'd risk going to jail?
I told you I have nothing to say.
All right.
Well, if you're not going to talk to us,
maybe you'll talk to someone else.
Mags.
Uncle.
Maggie, I know what you're feeling,
cause I'm feeling it, too.
But you have to cooperate with these people.
You need to trust them.
They're only here to help us.
Maggie, your father was beaten
within an inch of his life.
If you want to protect the people who did this,
go right ahead.
You told me my father was shot.
He was, but that was after
somebody used him as a punching bag.
No. It's impossible.
The picture doesn't lie.
No one could beat my father that way.
He was the best.
Best?
Best at what?
Whatever you know,
please tell these guys.
Have you ever heard of Kapu Kuialua?
Lua.
It's the ancient Hawaiian martial art,
primarily hand-to-hand combat.
What's that got to do with your father's murder?
My father was an Olohe,
a Lua master,
and I'm his student.
Why didn't Thomas ever tell me?
We kept it secret.
My father grew up believing it was huna.
The practice was outlawed by the Colonial powers
because they felt threatened by it.
Some traditionalists still believe that
training should only be done in secret,
and only by native Hawaiian men.
Well, if only by men, then how did you get involved?
My father wanted to pass on his legacy,
and I'm an only child.
He made me swear
never to tell outsiders what we were doing.
For eight years, he trained me secretly.
Let me guess--
on Tuesday nights.
You said "outsiders."
So, who were the insiders?
My father didn't just train me.
There were others.
How many?
He trained about two dozen men
on his compound out in Waimea.
Maggie, what are you doing bringing these people here?
Shane, just hear them out.
Mr. Kawano, I'm Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly.
This is Officer Kalakaua, Five-O.
We're here to investigate the murder of Thomas Hoapili.
Thomas Hoapili wouldn't want you here.
This is private property. You're trespassing.
This is my family's property. These officers are welcome here.
They need our help.
For my father, please.
Before Thomas was shot, he was in a fight.
In fact, he was almost beaten to death.
Do you recognize either of them?
No. I'm sorry.
Can you think of anyone
who might have wanted him dead?
I've run this pa lua for Thomas for nine years.
In all that time, I've never known him
to have any enemies, especially among the haumana.
It's what I told you.
Thomas wasn't just a Lua master;
he was our patron.
He allowed us to use his land.
His money paid for our classes.
We looked up to him.
Doesn't mean that someone here didn't have a motive to hurt him.
No one could match my father's abilities.
No one here would lay a hand on him,
because no one could.
Well, someone did.
And if anyone here was in a fight,
there'd be signs of injuries,
so we're going to have to check everyone.
Starting with you.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Chin.
He just finished a visual examination
of all the students, looking for trauma.
He also ran alibis.
Doesn't look like any of them
had anything to do with the murder.
Guys.
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Thought I told you to stay put.
I got something.
Showed the fuzzy picture around
and got the girl's name: Kat Carrigan.
Who is she?
Ex-MMA fighter
with mad skills in Muay Thai.
Got herself banned from legal competition
for all sorts of rule violations.
Got her.
Kat Carrigan. According to TSA, she arrived
on the island two days ago from Bangkok.
Clear.
Check this out.
His name is Ramsey Pollock.
Flew into Oahu two days ago.
Same flight as Kat Carrigan.
What do we know about him?
He's American, 33 years old.
He was the former MMA heavyweight contender.
He's proficient in six different martial arts,
and he lives most of the year in Brussels.
Well, looks like Pollock's been racking up
some serious frequent flyer miles.
The past four months, he's been in six different countries,
including Russia, Colombia
and, most recently, Thailand.
According to authorities, he is suspected
in all of those countries of running illegal fights.
Now, these are high-stakes underground bouts
where wealthy fans pay big bucks to sit ringside.
There's no rules, there's no refs.
People die.
This guy's also got a reputation
for defeating every style of fighter
that he's ever gone up against.
Unfortunately, every time law enforcement
gets close to bringing him down, Pollock disappears.
Of course, no witnesses?
Right.
Well, what's the first rule of fight club?
You do not talk about fight club.
No, nobody's talking about it,
but people are paying top dollar
to sit ringside at these fights.
I just ran Pollock's financials.
26 wire transfers in the last 48 hours,
each for 100 grand.
That's almost $2.5 million.
So, looks like Pollock brought his fight club to Oahu.
Okay, so he comes here,
he kidnaps Thomas Hoapili, forces him onto the fight card.
Now, if Pollock fought every other type of fighter and won,
he needed to up the ante.
Offer the fight fans something worth paying for.
And fighting an elusive Lua master,
now that makes it a hot ticket.
But then why stick around?
I mean, after that car crash,
Pollock would be an idiot not to flee the island.
Ah, but maybe Pollock and Thomas was just the undercard.
What are you talking about?
Pollock just wired half a million dollars
into Kat Carrigan's account, just this morning.
So, what, payment for helping him grab Thomas?
Either that or a purse for another fight.
Well, two underground fight nights are certainly
more profitable than one.
So if our vic was the undercard,
maybe Carrigan is the main event.
I think we might know who her opponent is.
Hello?
Maggie, it's Lieutenant Kelly.
Where are you?
Steve.
It was Pollock and Carrigan.
Security cam confirms it.
I already called in the vehicle.
Kono pulled Pollock and Carrigan's phone records.
20 international calls made in the last three hours.
She cross-referenced the numbers with TSA,
got names and passports.
Bunch of rich guys
flew in on private jets. According to TSA,
they're still here.
You were right.
There's a second fight.
Hey, guys?
Did you find them?
I'm still working on that.
But I just found four calls to a local number
on Pollock's call log.
They all go to Shane Kawano.
Why the hell's he talking to our killer?
Every fight needs a promoter, right?
Shane,
what's going on?
Your father gave me no choice.
Shane.
After all he did for you?
You son of a bitch.
He treated you like a brother!
I gave my soul to that school,
but I was always still in his shadow.
That's the way he liked it.
What are you talking about?
I went to him.
I showed him what we could do.
The money we both could make.
How we could open the school to outsiders,
teach them.
So you had him murdered because he wouldn't exploit Lua?
Because he wouldn't sell out?
Is that it?
Your father was an extreme traditionalist.
He was living in the Stone Age.
And when you inherited his mantle,
you would have been as stubborn as he was.
But with us out of the way, you could just cash in.
You're the one who killed my father.
Save your strength.
Gonna need it.
It looks like they're consolidated in Diamond Head.
446 Alapali Place.
It's listed as a private residence-- beach rental.
This is what you made my father do?
I won't fight!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up! Fight!
Fight!
Get up! Fight!
Get her! Get her!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
You want to hit someone,
come hit me.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Going somewhere?
Hope you had a fantastic evening.
These nice gentlemen with the hats and the guns,
they're gonna take you to jail.
Thank you very much for your patronage.
Come on.
Maggie.
Kawano had my father killed.
And he's going to jail
for the rest of his life for that.
Come on, I got you.
You okay?
Yes.
Uncle, what are you still doing here?
You should go home.
I'll be fine.
Little sister,
through thick and thin,
your pops... always there for me.
I'm always gonna be there for you.
Hey, we missed you surfing yesterday morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had something else to do, you know.
Yeah? What's going on?
Oh, nothing. No, it's just some, uh, work-related stuff.
So...
Well, I can't believe that you passed up my grandmother's ragu
for a beef stew MRE.
I had a craving.
For military rations?
Can you do me a favor and pass me that canteen
behind you there, please?
You know what, I got my camo in the car.
If you want, I can throw them on and we can play out
this whole "Trapped in a foxhole"
fantasy thing you got going on right now.
I'll put this beef stew down right now.
You love the foxhole fantasy, don't you?
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Catherine, could you quick just help me with this?
Yeah. Oh.
Doris, you look amazing.
Thank you.
What's the occasion?
I've got a date.
Sorry, what?
That's probably him.
Yes, I think it's just stuck in kind of a thing there, see?
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
You told me to keep an eye on your mother.
An eye, not hand.
Not any other part of your body. She's my mother.
Steve, at my age, they're all mothers or grandmothers.
What can I tell you? We got chemistry.
Anthuriums.
Oh, they're so beautiful.
Thank you.
Um, Mick, this is Catherine.
Catherine, this is Mick.
Hi. How are you?
Hi. Very nice to meet you, Mick.
How you doing?
And I think you already know Steve.
Um, I'll just put these in water.

Yeah, but, uh, don't be too long,
'cause we got reservations.
Got it.
Oh, Doris, let me take the flowers.
Oh, thank you.
Chemistry.
