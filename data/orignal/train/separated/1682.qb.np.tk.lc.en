problem ?
this is the worst cobbler i &apos;ve ever eaten .
it tastes like it &apos;s made of actual ground @-@ up shoemaker .
amusing . a play on the two meanings of &quot; cobbler . &quot;
hey guys . guess who i found at lax ?
my baby sister priya .
excuse me i object .
you propose a guessing game
yet you don &apos;t give me enough time to guess .
for the record i was going to say :
&quot; your sister priya . &quot;
oh sheldon . you haven &apos;t changed a bit have you ?
why would i change ?
the hope has been that
you &apos;d eventually bend to public opinion .
so priya what brings you back to l.a. ?
i have a one @-@ day layover on my way to toronto .
corporate merger .
can you believe it ?
little priya &apos;s one of the lead attorneys
for the biggest car company in india .
given that when we met her she was finishing law school
and planning an internship at a large indian car company
it &apos;s actually extremely plausible .
and your poll numbers just keep dropping .
i want to catch up with all of you
but first i really must visit the loo .
i &apos;m going too ; i &apos;ll show you where it is .
all right this goes without saying
but i &apos;m just going to say it anyway .
hands off my sister .
why would i touch her ? she &apos;s covered with airplane germs .
i &apos;m so not talking to you . i &apos;m talking to him .
hey . i &apos;ve got a girlfriend now .
oh please .
my sister &apos;s much hotter than your girlfriend
and you know it .
let &apos;s just agree they &apos;re both hot .
but dude that &apos;s my sister you &apos;re talking about !
okay forget who &apos;s hotter .
the first time priya came to l.a. leonard and i made a pact
out of respect to our friendship and to you
that neither of us would hit on her .
did you pinky @-@ swear ?
yes .
okay then .
cobbler . i &apos;m still laughing .
it &apos;s really nice to see you again leonard .
yeah . it &apos;s good to see you too .
here you go .
thanks .
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa !
okay .
so you got any special plans with your sister ?
oh not really . just hang out .
i always tell people &quot; if you have only one day
in los angeles make it a train day . &quot;
train day ?
the fun starts with brunch at carney &apos;s in studio city
a hotdog stand in a converted railroad dining car .
next stop travel town
an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines
cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s .
and finally we &apos;re off to the glitz and glamour of hollywood
for dinner at--that &apos;s right-- the hollywood carney &apos;s
a hotdog stand in a &lt; i &gt; different &lt; / i &gt; converted railroad dining car .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to do that .
well then apparently you hate fun .
priya &apos;s not back yet ?
well i guess that &apos;s not unusual .
women men the whole sitting @-@ standing deal .
so what are we talking about ?
uh my plans with priya .
he rejected train day .
did you make it clear that it &apos;s two different train cars
turned into hotdog stands ?
abundantly .
i guess he just hates fun .
that &apos;s what i said !
okay so ... what &apos;s new with you guys ?
i have a girlfriend now .
hey good for you !
yeah i just want to put it out there
in case i inadvertently
squirt any pheromones in your direction .
happy ?
so priya what are your plans while you &apos;re here ?
i don &apos;t know . i just have the one day .
do you like trains ?
not particularly .
you might as well just wait at the airport for your flight .
&quot; you are in a forest .
&quot; there is quicksand to the west
a path leads to the east . &quot;
go east .
&quot; an iron gate blocks your way . &quot;
open gate .
&quot; it &apos;s locked . &quot;
hmm .
well so much for that .
it &apos;s getting pretty late . how come you &apos;re still up ?
i found an emulator online that lets you play classic text @-@ based
computer games from the 1980s .
that &apos;s pretty cool .
oh yes . it runs on the world &apos;s most powerful graphics chip :
imagination .
you &apos;ve really got to get out more .
go north .
&quot; you can &apos;t go that way . &quot;
go west .
&quot; a troll blocks your passage . &quot;
okay . fasten your seatbelts .
kill troll .
&quot; with what ? &quot;
with sword .
&quot; you don &apos;t have the sword . &quot;
good golly it &apos;s as if it &apos;s actually happening to me .
raj finally went to bed .
sheldon &apos;s still up .
you said he goes to bed at 9 : 00 .
yeah he does but he got caught up in a computer game and ...
hit troll with axe !
hit troll with axe !
hit troll with axe !
my this is one tough troll .
can &apos;t you get rid of him ?
if the past is any indication no .
leonard i &apos;m trapped in quicksand !
the axe is dragging me down !
drop axe !
drop axe brilliant !
give me a minute .
sheldon .
hold on .
trying to figure out how to get the bucket
so i can carry the mud past the dragon .
sheldon you need to work in the morning .
i know !
well then bed mister !
five more minutes !
really ?
you &apos;re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your
thermodynamic fluctuations seminar ?
you know what happens when you yawn in public .
everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula .
you don &apos;t want that do you ?
no .
but it &apos;s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated .
who was at the door ?
uh building manager .
they have to fix a pipe
so the water &apos;ll be off tomorrow from noon to 2 : 00 .
that &apos;s unacceptable .
we &apos;re supposed to be given written notice .
well no it doesn &apos;t matter-- we &apos;ll be at work .
what if i spill tomato soup on my shirt
and have to come home to change
only to find there &apos;s no water for an enzyme soak ?
bifurcated uvula sheldon !
i &apos;ll have the chicken noodle . good night !
we &apos;re going to have to be very quiet .
i know how to get the bucket !
i can turn the axe around
and use the handle to reach it .
let &apos;s see .
go north .
&quot; you are in a forest . &quot;
go north .
&quot; you are in a forest . &quot;
go north .
&quot; you are in a forest . &quot; oh dear i believe i &apos;m lost .
well i &apos;ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow .
no no no ! you just took a wrong turn .
you just need to map it out .
come on i &apos;ll help you .
so you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times ?
yes .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re lost . good luck .
leonard . wake up .
huh ? wh-- sorry .
for what ?
i don &apos;t know . when i &apos;m in bed with a girl it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s my go @-@ to response .
it &apos;s 6 : 00 . i have to get back to raj &apos;s
before he wakes up and realizes i &apos;m gone .
oh . right . sure .
i wish you could stay in l.a. a while longer .
mmm me too .
you know i was thinking
there are some great research facilities in india .
where are you going with this leonard ?
well i &apos;m just saying you know i don &apos;t have any real ties here
so if i were to move to new delhi we could you know--
go out .
leonard didn &apos;t we have this conversation five years ago ?
well yes but ...
things have changed .
you know you &apos;re older i &apos;m older--
look no more superhero bed sheets .
sweetheart
just because we have fun when i come to town doesn &apos;t mean
i want to have a serious relationship .
it doesn &apos;t ?
mm @-@ mm .
and besides i could never bring a white boy home to my parents .
they &apos;d have a cow .
which is a much bigger deal in india .
i &apos;m not that white .
my great @-@ great @-@ grandmother was half cherokee .
i know that &apos;s not the right kind of indian but it is something .
you &apos;re funny .
leonard ?
leonard ?
leonard ?
what ?
i heard a woman laughing .
oh uh yeah . i was trying to see if i could laugh as a woman .
oh ! well good job . quite convincing .
i smell perfume .
air freshener .
and is that lipstick on your cheek and neck ?
rash . that &apos;s a bad rash .
my sympathies .
i &apos;m no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis .
can i interest you in a topical steroid
from my lotion and unguent collection ?
uh yeah yeah that sounds great .
very well . i &apos;m sure i can find something
that will help you ditch that itch .
okay he &apos;s in the bathroom . let &apos;s go .
do you prefer ointment or cream ?
cream .
with or without a numbing agent ?
without .
really leonard ?
there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis .
fine . with .
prescription or non @-@ prescription strength ?
use your best judgment .
well i think i have a nice 2009 anamantle hc .
it &apos;s usually indicated for acutely inflamed hemorrhoids
but it also goes nicely with non @-@ mucosal body parts .
sounds great .
excellent choice .
okay hurry hurry hurry .
come on come on come on .
priya ?
good morning sheldon .
for shame leonard for shame .
and to think i was ready to waste
the last of my good hemorrhoid cream on you .
making pretty good time huh ?
is that really what you want to talk about leonard ?
no .
what do you want to talk about ?
please don &apos;t tell anyone
i spent the night with raj &apos;s sister .
there it is .
what if someone asks ?
no one &apos;s going to ask if i spent the night with raj &apos;s sister .
perhaps but they might ask me something else .
like what ?
like
&quot; has leonard betrayed any of his friends recently ? &quot;
priya and i are both adults .
i didn &apos;t betray raj .
in fact you did but i was referring to howard .
what are you talking about ?
april 12.2005 .
bob &apos;s big boy toluca lake .
raj had just introduced us to priya for the first time .
she was enjoying the sweet taste of hindu rebellion
in the form of a bob &apos;s super big boy hamburger .
in order to preserve your friendship
you and howard made a pinky swear
that neither of you would attempt to woo her .
i had a patty melt .
okay fine i betrayed howard .
and raj .
all right and raj .
and me .
you ?
violation of the roommate agreement &apos;s
overnight guest notification clause .
okay fine i @-@ i &apos;m a horrible human being .
i &apos;m the darth vader of pasadena .
you &apos;re far too short to be darth vader .
at best you might be a turncoat ewok .
my point is : priya &apos;s gone and it would be much better
if no one else found out about us .
you mean you want me to keep a secret ?
yes .
you know i can &apos;t keep a secret .
you can if you try .
think about it this way :
um if i were batman and you were alfred
you &apos;d keep that secret right ?
why do you get to be batman ?
because batman has the secret .
alfred has secrets too .
like what ?
alfred knows
that barbara gordon is batgirl .
which i &apos;ve now just told to batman .
see i cannot keep a secret .
ta @-@ dah !
what ?
ta @-@ dah .
it &apos;s short for ...
da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da ! ?
kind of busy here sheldon .
i know that &apos;s why i shortened it .
what do you want ?
i came to go over your alibi for last night .
what alibi ?
you &apos;ve asked me to lie on your behalf and as you know
i am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonesty
so i &apos;ve provided you with an ironclad alibi .
you couldn &apos;t have spent last night with priya
because you were with another woman .
oh i &apos;m so sure i &apos;m gonna regret this
but who was i with ?
the fun @-@ loving and morally loose miss maggie mcgarry .
oh god .
you met her at pasadena &apos;s most popular
irish watering hole lucky baldwin &apos;s
where maggie spends her nights tending bar
with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams .
&quot; leonard call me if you are interested in coitus .
sincerely maggie mcgarry . &quot;
and if anyone were
to actually call that number they will hear this .
top of the morning to you .
you &apos;ve reached maggie mcgarry .
leave a message after the wee little beep .
it &apos;s pretty convincing huh ?
that wasn &apos;t even a real person .
and here is the clincher :
a lock of maggie &apos;s flaming auburn hair .
where &apos;d you get that ?
from an orangutan in the primate lab .
an orangutan ?
well no one &apos;s going to run a dna test on it leonard .
honestly you overthink everything .
sheldon i don &apos;t need an alibi .
nobody &apos;s going to ask about last night
as long as you just zip your lip .
thank you .
now don &apos;t worry everything is going to be fine .
hey .
hey leonard will you please tell howard
my sister has never been attracted to him ?
come on raj
how am i supposed to know
who she is attracted to or was attracted to
or who she might be attracted to in the future ?
and i have nothing to contribute
to this conversation .
because i too know absolutely nothing
about priya &apos;s preferences in male companionship .
and with that i will re @-@ zip my lip .
hey so what did you guys think
of the new episode of caprica last night ?
i didn &apos;t see it .
didn &apos;t see it ?
what were you doing ?
uh i was out .
what on caprica night ?
yeah i uh went for a drink .
really you ?
where w @-@ where &apos;d you go ?
to uh ...
lucky baldwin &apos;s .
oh i &apos;ve heard of that place .
isn &apos;t that pasadena &apos;s favorite irish watering hole ?
yes .
did you meet
anyone interesting there
perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid ?
as a matter of fact ... i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t i can &apos;t
i can &apos;t do it .
sure you can you &apos;re doing fine it &apos;s very believable .
i &apos;m sorry raj but the truth is
i was with priya last night .
don &apos;t listen to him .
he &apos;s still light @-@ headed from all the irish whiskey
and pickled eggs in his system .
what were you doing with priya ?
i believe they engaged in coitus
but more importantly
if leonard had not abandoned his story
would you have found it plausible ?
you slept with my sister ? !
yeah .
how could you ? we had a pact .
excuse me i think &quot; how could you ? she &apos;s my sister &quot;
takes precedence over a five @-@ year @-@ old pinky swear .
may i point out
in a parallel universe your friends are saying
&quot; maggie mcgarry-- she sounds lovely . &quot;
look i @-@ i admit it i may have crossed a line here
but come on raj your sister is a grown woman
and to her i &apos;m a forbidden piece of white chocolate .
i don &apos;t believe it .
this is a terrible betrayal of my trust .
no w @-@ w @-@ would it help if i told you
that i offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it ?
how hard did she stomp ?
very hard .
okay i &apos;m good .
well raj
i just want to say that i &apos;d never betray your trust .
unlike leonard i respect you .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm .
was it out of respect that you didn &apos;t tell raj
about the time you dropped his iphone in a urinal ?
dude i put that thing on my face !
i think a more amusing violation of raj &apos;s trust
is when howard convinced him that foreigners give presents
to americans on thanksgiving .
hey i didn &apos;t see you giving back
your snoopy snow cone maker .
that was all a lie ?
this year &apos;s gifts are already wrapped .
and as long as we &apos;re talking about betraying our friends
how about the month sheldon spent grinding up insects
and mixing them into leonard &apos;s food ?
well excuse me .
that was not a betrayal .
that was an experiment to determine
at what concentration food starts tasting &quot; mothy . &quot;
you put moths in my food ? !
for science .
i can &apos;t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth .
well i can &apos;t believe you used sheldon &apos;s toothbrush .
you used my toothbrush ?
not the brush part just the little rubber thing
to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums .
okay i @-@ i think it &apos;s safe to say
that we &apos;ve all done some things
we &apos;re not particularly proud of .
but come on we &apos;re friends .
friends overlook each other &apos;s minor lapses .
for the record howard i &apos;m sorry that i broke our pact .
thank you .
and i &apos;m sorry about your phone
and thanksgiving .
and while we &apos;re at it
you don &apos;t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of july .
as long as we &apos;re apologizing
sheldon i &apos;m i &apos;m sorry i used your toothbrush .
and i &apos;m sorry ...
but that behavior is beyond the pale
and cannot be tolerated .
we are no longer friends .
i got you a talking thomas the tank engine for thanksgiving .
with real puffing smoke ?
yes .
all right .
but i &apos;m watching you .
hey you &apos;ve got snoopy out .
can i have a snow cone ?
well sure .
this is pretty good .
what flavor is this ?
guess .
papaya ?
no .
guava ?
you &apos;re so close .
i give up .
mango caterpillar .
what are you doing ? !
