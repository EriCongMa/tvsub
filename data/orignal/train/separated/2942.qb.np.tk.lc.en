hey , hon ? would you help me get the plates down ?
hey , here &apos;s an idea . why don &apos;t we use our wedding china today ?
or we could save them for a fancy special occasion .
how about this : you could treat me like i &apos;m an equal ..
or talk down to me like i &apos;m a child .
no , i just think we should save our china for something really special .
like if the queen of england comes over .
honey , she keeps canceling on us . take the hint .
what if something breaks ? they &apos;re expensive .
what is the point of having them if we never use them ?
okay . but if something breaks and then the queen comes over ..
i will explain it to her .
like i &apos;d let you talk to the queen .
wow , the parade is really good this year .
man , those horses can crap .
next up is a marching band from muskogee , oklahoma .
muskogee ? that &apos;s like four hours from tulsa !
y &apos;all look great !
that &apos;s right , i said &quot; y &apos;all ! &quot;
here &apos;s the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap ..
days of our lives .
oh , my god !
aren &apos;t you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap days of our lives ?
i forgot ! i &apos;m supposed to be there !
i can &apos;t believe i forgot ! i usually write stuff like this down on my arm !
stupid long sleeves !
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;ll come up with a good reason ..
why i wasn &apos;t there .
the producers are gonna be mad . they sat us down and said :
&quot; everyone has to be there , 6 a.m. sharp . that means you , tribbiani . &quot;
like i was some kind of idiot .
well , you proved them wrong .
the.one.with.rachels.other.sister

oh , my god .
is this emmett ?
it &apos;s emma .
it &apos;s a girl ?
hey , amy .
amy , you remember ross ?
not really .
but you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date .
that was me .
no , he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her ..
since , like , the ninth grade .
still me .
no , i &apos;m not talking about you .
it was your fat friend &apos;s brother with that bad afro .
okay , amy , i &apos;m gonna save you some time , okay ? all me !
careful . careful .
careful !
i &apos;ll tell you what . for the rest of our lives ..
i &apos;ll be careful until told otherwise .
this isn &apos;t the china we picked out .
i know .
after you left the store , i chose different ones .
why ?
your taste is a little feminine for me .
suddenly flowers are feminine ?
hey , everybody ! happy thanksgiving !
happy thanksgiving . phoebe !
what &apos;s going on , joe ?
listen , i need a good lie .
okay .
how about the whole &quot; man walking on the moon &quot; thing , you know ?
you can see the strings , people !
no , no , no . i need a good lie to explain why i wasn &apos;t at a work thing today .
honey , you stink at lying .
i do not .
really ? let me ask you something . yesterday at the coffeehouse ..
i went to the bathroom . when i came back , my muffin was gone . who took it ?
somebody opened the door to the coffeehouse ..
and a raccoon ran in and went straight for your muffin . i said :
&quot; hey , don &apos;t eat that ! that &apos;s phoebe &apos;s ! &quot; and he said ..
he said , &quot; joey , you stink at lying . &quot; what am i gonna do ?
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll come up with a lie . i &apos;ll help you .
great . that &apos;d be great . thank you .
sure . what was the work thing ?
&quot; pick up grandma at the airport . &quot;
oh , man !
she &apos;s precious .
do you ever worry that she &apos;s gonna get your real nose ?
amy ..
yes , i do . i really do .
hello ?
yeah , hang on , one sec . can i take this upstairs ?
sure . we don &apos;t live there , but ..
seriously ? it &apos;s just these rooms ?
i thought you were a doctor .
yeah . no , ross has a ph.d.
god , she is unbelievable .
i know . i mean , a ph.d. is just as good as an md .
sure , ross , yeah !
if i have a heart attack at a restaurant , i want you there with your fossil brush .
stupid thanksgiving .
what ?
what ? what happened ?
my boyfriend canceled on me .
i mean , i finally find a real relationship .
someone that i can spend this day with , and then his wife comes back into town !
i swear , it &apos;s almost not even worth dating married guys .
don &apos;t say that .
god , i was so looking forward to this .
it was gonna be such a beautiful thanksgiving .
we were gonna have sushi .
amy , don &apos;t cry .
ross , can i talk to you in private ?
sure , you wanna go upstairs , or .. ?
look , i was thinking , if it &apos;s okay with monica ..
i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving .
i think that &apos;s a great idea . it &apos;ll be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis .
look , i know she &apos;s a little tough to take .
but she has nowhere else to go , and she &apos;s my sister . she &apos;s emma &apos;s aunt .
and i would like them to bond .
i don &apos;t want them bonding too much .
i don &apos;t want her telling emma she needs a nose job .
ross , she may need one . we &apos;re just gonna have to make our peace with that !
amy ..
amy ?
amy !
i &apos;m out in the hall .
your baby had some sort of explosion of stink .
the bonding &apos;s going great .
hi !
hey .
hey , you guys . this is my sister , amy .
this is chandler , joey , phoebe , and you know mon .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re on days of our lives !
yeah .
wow ! they must put a lot of makeup on you .
happy thanksgiving .
hey .
hi .
so welcome . is this the first time you &apos;re seeing emma ?
yeah , i think so . it &apos;s nice to meet you , emma .
phoebe .
that &apos;s a funny noise .
phoebe ? i still need some help here .
right . okay .
so it &apos;s not just the lie you tell , but it &apos;s the way you tell it . for example ..
if you look at the ground when you talk , people know you &apos;re lying .
i don &apos;t know why this is so hard for me . lying is basically just acting ..
and i am a terrific actor .
you are a terrific actor .
i could talk to the producers for you . i &apos;m a great liar .
take monica &apos;s dress . i said i loved it .
i hate it .
hey !
i &apos;m also a great moron .
hey . where &apos;s the baby ?
we just put her down for a nap .
listen , i was just thinking . you know what would be incredible ?
if you guys died !
thank you , amy .
no , no , then i would get the baby .
it would be just like a movie . at first i wouldn &apos;t know what to do with her .
and then i would rise to the occasion . then i &apos;d get a makeover and get married .
that &apos;s a great movie !
now , listen , not that you guys could stop me or anything ..
because you know , you &apos;d be dead .
but i was thinking about changing her name .
i &apos;m just not really a big fan of emily .
emma .
emma ? ross wants you .
phoebe !
why does she keep making that noise ?
honey , i don &apos;t know how to tell you this ..
but if something were to happen to ross or myself ..
you wouldn &apos;t get the baby .
well , who would ?
well , we haven &apos;t officially asked them yet ..
but we would want monica and chandler .
who ?
you &apos;re in their apartment .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d want us to raise emma .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so moved .
i don &apos;t believe this . hold on a second . you guys die ..
and i don &apos;t get your baby ?
amy , see , we &apos;re a lot closer to monica and chandler .
we see them every day . and truthfully , you don &apos;t seem connected to the baby .
connected ? to what ? she &apos;s a lump .
you know , guys , i &apos;ve gotta say this means so much to me .
i mean , that you would trust me with your child .
i mean , we all know that monica and i have been ..
trying to have a baby of our own .
you know , i &apos;ve had my doubts about my skills as a father , but ..
that you two ..
that you two ..
this guy ?
seriously ?
okay , it &apos;s time for dinner .
everyone , we &apos;re using our fancy china ..
and it &apos;s very expensive , so please be careful .
okay , just to be clear , comedy with the plates will not be well @-@ received .
hey !
how come my plate &apos;s less fancy than everyone else &apos;s ?
do you not trust me with a fancy plate ?
no , honey . that &apos;s a special plate .
see , it &apos;s a game . whoever gets that plate wins .
i can &apos;t believe i won !
you know , this is such a slap in the face . i mean , i &apos;m your sister ..
and you would give your baby to these strangers over me .
monica is ross &apos; sister .
no , ross &apos; sister was really fat .
that was me .
no , she was this dorky girl in school who followed rachel around like a puppy ..
amy , you &apos;ve got to stop doing that !
okay , listen , i know you &apos;re having a bit of a family crisis ..
but you don &apos;t have to take it out on the plates .
i mean , in fact , i think that everyone ..
should cut their food like this :
now , see ? this way , you protect the plates ..
and let &apos;s face it , you have fun .
okay , how about this ? if you guys die ..
and the crazy plate lady dies ..
then do i get the baby ?
no , if crazy plate lady ..
if monica dies , then i would get emma . right ?
well , actually ..
actually what ?
it &apos;s just .. it &apos;s just that in that case ..
then emma would go to my parents .
what ?
hurts , doesn &apos;t it ?
who has to die for me to get her ?
so if monica &apos;s not around , i &apos;m not good enough to raise emma ?
no , that is not what we &apos;re saying .
yeah , he &apos;s lying . he looked down .
well , what &apos;s wrong with me ? am i incompetent ?
because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !
you &apos;re taking this the wrong way . we think you are going to be a wonderful parent .
it &apos;s just .. you &apos;re more the , you know , fun parent .
yeah , and we wanna make sure emma also has someone like monica ..
who &apos;s more of a disciplinarian .
someone who can be firm and strict .
that &apos;s not how you see me , is it ?
no , you &apos;re all about the fun .
i may not know a lot about babies , but do you really think i &apos;m not capable ?
no . you both are equally capable .
it &apos;s just you &apos;re strongest when you &apos;re together .
okay . so if we both had emma , and i died ..
she &apos;d have to give her up .
sure . monica would have to give her up .
i lie better than that , right ?
let me just get this straight . so my two friends die , i get emma .
then my wife dies . then emma , the one tiny ray of hope left in my life ..
gets taken away from me ?
there &apos;s your movie .
hey , there you are .
you disappeared after dinner .
did somebody miss me ?
was there a child to raise poorly ?
ross and rachel don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re so responsible .
emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five @-@ year @-@ old condom .
no , but they &apos;re right . i &apos;m not a strong father figure , and i never will be .
no , you learn these things . you grow into it .
yeah , but it &apos;s not who i am .
everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid . and it &apos;s true .
and look , everybody knows it .
i don &apos;t know it .
i wanna have a kid with you because i think you &apos;ll be an amazing dad .
at the fun parts and at the hard parts .
well , can you picture me saying , &quot; go to your room , you &apos;re grounded &quot; ?
can you hear me say , &quot; you &apos;re grounded &quot; ?
you said that to me last week .
how hard is it ? &quot; no shoes on the furniture ! &quot;
the producer from days left a message asking why i wasn &apos;t at the parade .
they said everybody &apos;s really pissed off at me . and they all got to meet santa !
it &apos;s okay . i thought of the perfect lie for you .
it &apos;s easy to remember , and it doesn &apos;t invite a lot of questions .
does it have something to do with a spaceship ?
the statue of liberty came to life ..
you weren &apos;t at the parade because you had a family emergency .
i like that ! yeah !
i wasn &apos;t at the parade because i had a family emergency .
what happened ?
my sister &apos;s raccoon came ..
no , nothing with a raccoon !
wait , what are you doing ?
setting the table .
we thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too .
how nice . maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress .
hey , dude , you okay ? sorry about before .
that &apos;s okay . you &apos;re totally right . i don &apos;t know anything about disciplining a child .
but it did hurt my feelings , and i want you to know that if i die ..
you don &apos;t get joey .
in case you hadn &apos;t noticed , i &apos;m not talking to you .
you know , this is just .. this is classic rachel .
oh , yeah , right . remember in high school when i died and didn &apos;t give you my baby ?
this might be my one chance to have a child , rachel .
i mean , you know that i have been so busy focusing on my career ..
what career ?
i &apos;m a decorator .
you decorate dad &apos;s office and now you &apos;re a decorator ?
okay , i went to the zoo yesterday , now i &apos;m a koala bear .
why can &apos;t you ever be supportive ?
you wanna talk supportive ?
you didn &apos;t come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby !
you didn &apos;t come see me in the hospital when i was getting my lips done !
i did the first time .
you know what ? you wanna know why i am not giving emily to you ?
emma .
whose side are you on ? !
i &apos;m not giving you emma because you can &apos;t handle the responsibility of a child .
well , how hard could it be ? you do it .
you wanna know why you don &apos;t want me to have the baby ?
because you don &apos;t want me to be happy .
you have always been jealous of me .
jealous of what ?
of your lack of responsibility ? your immaturity ?
your total disregard for other people &apos;s feelings ?
to name a few .
you &apos;ve always been like this .
you had to have everything , and i couldn &apos;t have anything .
like in junior high , when you stole timmy from me .
i mean , do you even realize how much that hurt me ?
timmy was my boyfriend , and you made out with him !
come on , that was 20 years ago . get over it .
i cannot believe that i invited you here today !
yeah , well , you know what i cannot believe ? that my so @-@ called sister ..
gets a 30 percent discount from ralph lauren , and i still have to pay retail ?
it &apos;s 45 .
you bitch .
you just think you &apos;re so perfect ..
with your new baby and your small apartment .
well , let me tell you something . your baby isn &apos;t even that cute .
too far , amy . too far .
you take that back .
no .
take it back !
no . what are you gonna do ? make me ?
hey , man , i work out !
so do i.
i do pilates .
i do yoga .
bring it on !
put the plates in the boxes ! put the plates in the boxes !
did you just push me ?
yeah , i think i did .
all right , that &apos;s it .
forget the bubble wrap ! there isn &apos;t time !
frizzy , frizzy , frizzy !
shouldn &apos;t we stop this ?
are you out of your mind ?
let &apos;s throw some jell @-@ o on them !
hey , someone could get hurt .
kick her , rach ! kick her !
pull her top off , rach ! pull her top off !
gross !
all right , that is it ! this is our apartment , and you cannot behave this way !
if you can &apos;t act your age , you shouldn &apos;t be here at all .
those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones that i picked out ..
but they &apos;re important to monica . and i want you to apologize to her , now .
i &apos;m sorry .
mon , i &apos;m so sorry .
okay . that &apos;s better .
now , i want you to apologize to each other and mean it .
sorry .
sorry .
by the way , that fight was totally arousing .
dude , well done .
if i die and rachel dies and monica dies , you can totally take care of emma .
yeah ? well , thanks .
so .. so now do i get joey ?
okay . but you should know he eats a lot and shoves pennies up his nose .
are you okay , mon ?
i mean , these things happen . i mean , it &apos;s just a plate .
it &apos;s not like somebody died .
it &apos;s all right . you can mourn .
thank you . it was so beautiful !
i &apos;m gonna go to joey &apos;s and get the pies .
actually , not pies . it &apos;s just pie .
i don &apos;t care .
oh , my god , i &apos;ve lost the will to scold .
look , amy ..
we got a little ..
a little out @-@ of @-@ control over there .
and i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re my sister ..
and if it really means that much to you ..
so you &apos;re gonna give me the baby ?
no , i was ..
i was gonna let you use my ralph lauren discount .
you are not gonna regret this .
she needs changing .
no , no , no . i &apos;ll get her .
i am super confident , totally responsible and fourth in line to raise emma .
i &apos;ll be right there , emma ! just let me get my trusty diaper bag here .
well , what do you know ? i guess i &apos;ll be the one who dies first .
does monica know about her plates ?
nope .
broke them all , huh ?
yep .
you gonna tell her ?
nope .
hey . so i &apos;m gonna put the plates back .
i think you &apos;re right . we shouldn &apos;t use these plates for a long time .
like only if the queen comes ?
maybe not even then .
hey . i did it .
i told my producer i had a family emergency . he totally bought it .
thanks for teaching me how to lie .
no problem . next week , stealing .
bye , plates .
you told her you broke all the plates ?
what ? ! something happened with the plates ?
