yes , he knows . he just didn &apos;t know who you are . it &apos;s ok .
tell me you got something .
a casing and a rifle up on the roof .
this guy isn &apos;t sloppy . he &apos;s sending us a message .
garcia , we need to access the surveillance footage .
of course . i &apos;m on it .
what else we got ?
that &apos;s it right now .
where were you and savannah standing ?
we were standing right over there on the side of my truck .
we were just talking .
she was to the back and i was facing her .
i was the one who was vulnerable . i was the easy shot .
how &apos;s savannah ?
she &apos;s in surgery .
come on , let &apos;s check in .
you guys got this ?
go .
metro pd &apos;s gonna secure all the windows
and have an officer placed in front of savannah &apos;s room 24 / 7 .
thanks .
i got us a conference room down the hall to work in ,
and i &apos;m getting access to the security cams right now .
great .
you two need coffee ?
i &apos;m good .
no . thanks .
tara &apos;s donating blood in case savannah needs more .
it turns out they &apos;re the same type .
that &apos;s jj ,
who i &apos;m return texting .
she and reid are looking at the footage
to see if there &apos;s anything .
hopefully you are officially caught up now
and i will continue to do so . come on , sit .
when is someone gonna let me know they &apos;re gonna be ok ?
i totally feel you .
you &apos;re not alone in this .
just stop .
please just stop . i can &apos;t take your blind optimism right now .
it &apos;s not helping me . just stop .
sorry . i just--
what &apos;s up ? what do we got ?
you can &apos;t investigate this .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re a material witness in your wife &apos;s shooting
and a target .
and not just tonight but for the past 6 months .
hotch , how can you , of all people , ask me to sit this out ?
you didn &apos;t back off when foyet attacked your family .
and how did that turn out ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t sit down and do nothing .
your job right now is to be a husband and a father .
hotch , please .
i have a skill set
that can help find this son of a bitch .
no .
you &apos;re off the case .
so if security footage has no angles
of the shooting or the rooftop , where does that leave us ?
we &apos;re running facial recognition on everyone
in and around the hospital
to see if they match any loose ends from morgan &apos;s abduction .
how did he take it ?
as expected .
sir , i know that when morgan was on leave after his abduction ,
you encouraged him to stay away from the case .
and let me guess-- he didn &apos;t .
we all knew in our hearts it wasn &apos;t over ,
and , look , we were right , so in an extra @-@ curricular kind of way
we kept sleuthing to see who was working with john bradley .
before he came back to work ,
morgan said that he &apos;d found a connection
between the men who held him at the cabin and the montolo family .
right . so , basically ,
we &apos;re dealing with a big crime family tree ,
of which bradley was certainly a branch .
and the montolos had hired him multiple times .
did you scan the drawing ?
yeah , it &apos;s right here .
so , has everyone been working on this ?
yeah , basically .
kinda .
ok , with morgan &apos;s research , plus our bad guys / gals tree here ,
we &apos;ve cut all the legs off the evil table .
so like look--
you got assassin , mother , father ,
siblings , all deceased ,
one aunt in therapy for family trauma ,
and each line is like that .
montolo &apos;s line &apos;s the shortest of them all .
the only living child of chazz and rosemary montolo .
rosemary died when giuseppe was just a boy .
right . and then giuseppe went to live with his family in italy ,
and chazz went off to build a criminal empire .
looks like chazz montolo was killed last year .
yeah , in a bank fire in germany .
got positive i.d. on the dental and fingerprints .
one week after his son was murdered .
what if that &apos;s not a coincidence ?
so whoever poisoned the son also killed the father .
or he staged his own death
so we wouldn &apos;t suspect him of this .
hey , wait , wait , wait .
i only ran facial recognition
on living people for obvious reasons , but this guy right here ,
walking out of the hospital , this guy , that is ...
that &apos;s chazz montolo .
garcia , play the footage .
all right . garcia , contact the city ,
get access to traffic cameras .
now that we know he &apos;s here , we can find out where he went .
oh , wait , morgan &apos;s calling me .
i told him i &apos;d keep him in the know
before i knew it was an order that he wasn &apos;t supposed to know .
all right . reid , you talk to morgan .
jj , you and garcia track montolo ,
find out who his accomplices are . he doesn &apos;t work alone .
dave , you and i will find potential witnesses
who might have seen him on the property .
were you with garcia ?
yeah .
here , i brought you a green tea .
it won &apos;t make you as jittery as coffee .
you came instead of garcia
because you know i &apos;d be able to read her .
that is correct .
and hotch sent you here to see if i &apos;m stable .
he didn &apos;t say that , but ...
i don &apos;t get jittery .
usually you don &apos;t ,
but your carotid tells a different story .
i &apos;ve counted 10 heartbeats in the last 3 seconds .
that &apos;s about 20 % higher than your usual when you &apos;re under stress .
i know you &apos;re only trying to protect me ,
i get it , but knock it off .
i just want to know what you &apos;ve learned .
when you first told me about savannah ,
i &apos;d never seen you like that .
the decreased levels of central serotonin in your brain
cause intrusive thinking .
when i finally saw you guys together ,
that &apos;s when i knew for sure .
your pupils dilated , your posture changed ,
and i saw you
involuntarily reach for her hand .
science confirmed it .
you &apos;ve found the one . do you believe that ?
yes .
then believe this .
our team loves you ,
and we are not going to stop
until we find whoever did this .
but we can only do that with a completely dispassionate
and unprejudiced point of view .
paternal instinct is a deadly bias that we just can &apos;t risk .
it &apos;s for your protection , morgan , i swear .
ok .
the unsub is a father , isn &apos;t he ?
why do you say that ?
a paternal instinct is a deadly bias ?
those were your exact words .
i meant ...
i know what you meant .
but that &apos;s what you said .
go back to that first image .
keep rewinding .
ok , now pull up the hallway footage right before that .
hold it . right there .
oh , my god . he &apos;s right near morgan .
wait .
uh , look a the time stamp .
that &apos;s when i got the call , but ...
it wasn &apos;t an orderly who called me ,
it was him . he was right there .
morgan .
you ok ?
yeah .
no , i &apos;m ok .
it &apos;s a miracle , really .
whoever did this chose to hurt her
right in front of a hospital .
if the point was to kill her ,
why would he shoot her at a place where she could be saved ?
maybe the point wasn &apos;t to kill her .
the shooter called garcia
from the hospital minutes after the attack .
a homeless guy .
he stood out because he was wearing a ring .
i just wasn &apos;t focused enough at the time to flag it .
do we have any leads ?
giuseppe montolo &apos;s father .
chazz montolo .
he me to feel how he feels .
how did i do ?
hotch know you &apos;re here ?
i don &apos;t agree with taking you off the case .
when someone hurts one of us ,
when someone hurts a baby ...
yeah .
uh , i need to show this to the team ,
but i wanted you to see it first .
i found it in the pay phone he used to call garcia .
&quot; how does it feel ?
do you see red ?
i see red . &quot;
does that mean anything to you ?
no .
you sure ?
yeah .
ok .
hey . that thing have hot cocoa ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m getting .
make it two ?
here .
thanks .
how you holding up ?
i &apos;ve never seen him like this .
i want to fix it and i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s too much for anyone .
it &apos;s not fair and it needs to stop .
yeah .
are you all right ?
i showed it to morgan .
what did he say ?
same as us . it &apos;s a taunt .
â€­ that &apos;s all ?
and i &apos;m sorry . i thought it would help .
it &apos;s ok .
where are we with the motels and the sros along the bus route ?
mostly cash transactions , faceless tenants .
i &apos;ll get the washington field office to canvass the area .
why leave a note so seemingly on the nose
when every other action has been calculated for maximum pain ?
it has to mean more than simply &quot; i &apos;m angry . &quot;
it &apos;s a clue or a symbol .
it means something to morgan and i think chazz knows that .
well , he wants to drive morgan to exact revenge .
how do you think he &apos;s doing ?
well , after the physical and emotional stress
of 6 months ago , and now this ? the guy &apos;s a saint .
he passed his return evals .
yeah , but we wrote the questions .
he knows exactly what to say .
virginia , d.c. ,
and maryland agents are the way .
thank you , hotch .
how is she ?
still touch and go . i ...
i &apos;m waiting to see her .
the note . &quot; seeing red . &quot; what does it mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re looking for microexpressions .
you divided this team when we need to work together .
jj disobeyed orders by going to you ,
and now you &apos;re withholding .
i didn &apos;t divide this team .
you did .
it &apos;s the doctor .
i &apos;m sorry .
this should be me .
and i &apos;m so sorry .
where &apos;s agent morgan ?
he said you were calling him .
no .
well , then where is he ? he wouldn &apos;t just go off on his own .
garcia , pull up security footage of the emergency entrance .
let &apos;s go .
hotch .
where is he ?
he &apos;s not gonna stop .
morgan , tell me where he is .
i can &apos;t get anyone else hurt .
this isn &apos;t your call .
come on , you have to know what i &apos;m feeling right now .
that &apos;s why you need to come back here
or tell me where you &apos;re going .
i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
goodbye , aaron .
he &apos;s gone .
gps has him heading north
about a mile away from the hospital and then he stops .
why would he stop ?
he got rid of his phone .
no . no , no , no . that guy &apos;s trying to kill him .
he &apos;s walking into a trap .
i check in every 5 minutes .
if they don &apos;t hear from me ,
then they know who to kill first .
empty your gun .
you sit here with me
unless you want them all to die .
that officer , he works for me .
oh , no , wait , maybe it &apos;s the man doubled over in pain ,
or the nurse .
could be it &apos;s none of them
and i just tricked you into handing over your gun .
what do you choose to believe ?
that you &apos;re a narcissistic homicidal psychopath .
and you can &apos;t stand the fact that you failed 6 months ago ,
so now you &apos;re back to punish me .
i &apos;ll tell you what i believe .
you killed my son .
wrong .
you &apos;re the last person that saw him alive .
yes , i was , but someone else poisoned him .
how did he end up in prison ?
i arrested him . i didn &apos;t kill him .
that &apos;s your belief .
mine is that you killed my flesh and blood
and have no idea what that feels like .
yet .
sit .
sit .
we &apos;ve only just begun .
morgan was headed north when we lost him .
there are 3 highways in that direction .
he could have gone anywhere .
except montolo never left the city .
garcia , pull up that footage of him at the bus stop .
red line . red line .
he sees red .
but he never gets on . see , he moves right past it .
so , &quot; i see red . &quot;
what the hell does that mean ?
yeah .
you know what to do .
do you ever count how many choices you make in a day ?
the first is whether or not to get out of bed in the morning .
when giuseppe died ,
i really struggled with that one .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m gonna to give you some fatherly advice ,
something you missed out on as a kid , am i right ?
find your stillness .
you know , another choice i made was to stick with what works .
and this , for me , works .
it reflects who i am .
you decided on a semi @-@ automatic weapon ,
and that defines you .
now ...
did you kill my son ?
no .
morgan never calls me aaron .
why would he start ?
what else did he say ?
that of all people , i should understand .
he was talking about foyet .
yes . but he mentioned that earlier .
why would he bring it up again ?
he wanted you to relate to his rage and back off ?
is there any other relevance to foyet ?
he attacked in my home .
maybe morgan subconsciously let that slip .
yeah , but morgan &apos;s house isn &apos;t red .
yeah , but he &apos;s renovated a lot of houses over the years .
what if it &apos;s one of those ?
yeah .
you know , i could have shot her when you were far away from help ,
but i gave her a chance .
i made that choice .
think about it .
you &apos;re insane .
maybe .
you know , i learned a lot
by living in these walls that you built .
for example , at first , it was about changing the past ,
the power of transformation .
believing that anything can be fixed .
and then you finished the renovation .
and you decided to study behavior .
for a living .
and then , many years later
you crossed paths with my son .
so the decisions you made in these very walls
were the beginning of our journey .
wow . morgan was busy .
he has 8 properties .
he started renovating in 2001 right after 9 @-@ 11 .
i remember him saying
he didn &apos;t know what else to do with his frustration .
he thought tearing down walls would be a good start .
he wanted to restore them so he could control something .
could montolo know about these houses ?
it &apos;s public record , so probably .
uh , let &apos;s see .
morgan uses a service to rent out the properties .
here &apos;s one that &apos;s been rented for a while to a ...
c.r. joseph .
c.r. joseph , c.r. joseph , c.r ...
guys , joseph is the english translation of giuseppe .
what if &quot; c &quot; stands for chazz and &quot; r &quot; for rosemary ?
do you have an image of the property ?
i can find one .
let &apos;s go .
address on your phones .
we &apos;ve taken savannah out of the induced coma .
she &apos;s asking for her husband .
oh , dear .
uh , uh--thank you .
they need to do a c @-@ section . where is he ?
ok , the team had a lead on the case ,
and it &apos;s all about protecting you and the baby .
he wants to be here for this , but--
well , tell him to get back here .
ok , ok .
that &apos;s a hell of a way to come into the world , huh ?
your baby &apos;s birthday is gonna be on your headstone .
being a dad is all i &apos;ve thought about .
you must remember what that &apos;s like .
you want the best for your kid .
so you start thinking ...
am i doing this right ?
am i living the kind of life i want my kid to emulate ?
i really want to believe
that you &apos;ve wondered about that stuff with your son , but ...
i don &apos;t think so .
you &apos;ve had plenty of chances
to get out of that life , but you stayed .
and so did giuseppe , because that &apos;s all he knew .
the person to blame for the death of your son is you .
let &apos;s make this interesting .
i &apos;m going to give you a gift
that you did not give to me .
a chance to say goodbye .
pick it up .
no .
pick it up .
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
baby girl .
you &apos;re ok .
yeah .
savannah &apos;s awake .
i know .
you know ? ok , well ,
she &apos;s about to get a c @-@ section , so you need to get back here .
garcia ,
i need you to patch everyone in . do it now .
ok . hold on . hold on .
go ahead , garcia .
i &apos;ve got morgan .
are you all there ?
yeah , we &apos;re here . are you all right ?
he &apos;s got a gun with two bullets .
listen to me .
i made a decision tonight that led me to this .
this is my fault , you understand ? no one else &apos;s .
and if this is how it ends ...
it was meant to be .
don &apos;t say that .
promise me you &apos;ll look after savannah and my baby .
of course we will , but so will you .
derek ?
derek ?
promise me you &apos;ll look after savannah and my baby .
of course we will , but so will you .
my team was never in danger .
you don &apos;t know that .
this house doesn &apos;t have a land line .
now you pick it up .
there &apos;s one bullet left in that chamber , so pick it up .
it &apos;s your choice .
you either get arrested and rot in prison
or you pick up that gun and we end this .
pick it up !
you won &apos;t shoot an unarmed man .
i know you want to . i can see it .
come on , be a man .
come on . come on .
be a man ! pull the trigger !
or you won &apos;t sleep a night until i &apos;m dead .
it &apos;s a boy !
oh , my god !
jack was never this tiny .
the doctor said this incubator is gonna be home for another two weeks .
it &apos;s gonna fly by .
hotch , i get it .
i finally know what you guys have been talking about .
i never knew that 6 pounds , 1 ounce could knock me out .
you got the grip . right ?
he &apos;s strong .
ok , so it &apos;s not just me .
promise me you &apos;ll take some time .
about that ...
hotch ...
i just saw your prince down the hall .
he &apos;s sleeping like it &apos;s his job .
&apos;cause it is .
whew . pretty incredible , huh ?
i &apos;m so grateful .
you know , i &apos;ve learned that--
in the short time i &apos;ve had the privilege of being a dad ...
it heals wounds .
just being there for your kid .
like your dad wanted to be , i &apos;m sure .
like my daughter wanted me to be .
you are a good man . you know that .
you &apos;d have been there for her had you known .
i didn &apos;t have that choice .
but you do .
it &apos;s crazy , huh ?
i miss him .
he &apos;s just right down the hall .
well , let &apos;s go take a look .
it &apos;s time he meets his uncle dave .
yes , it is .
come on .
hey . i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you here .
but since you are ...
i got a little something for you and the family .
what ?
man , you &apos;re gonna have a lot of babysitters .
thank you .
we &apos;ll always be here for you , ok ?
i know .
i know .
i know you hate goodbyes , kid .
and change .
it isn &apos;t always a bad thing .
i just can &apos;t imagine this room without you .
so don &apos;t .
don &apos;t think about it .
just know i &apos;m always gonna be by your side .
i &apos;m just a phone call away .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t stay .
i don &apos;t want you to stay .
because i know why you &apos;re leaving
and i couldn &apos;t be happier for you .
listen , we were gonna mail these ,
but i wanted you to have a birth announcement first .
hank spencer morgan .
yeah .
hank is for my pops .
but spencer is for the best little brother
anybody could ever ask for .
i love you , kid .
i love you .
so , look , uh , my little dude ,
he &apos;s gonna need a big brother , too .
to teach him everything he knows about life .
and chess .
i can do that .
i know you can .
i want you to see him .
look at that .
â€­ oh , man .
i did good , huh ?
great . oh , wow .
look at that face .
look what i did . i packed you up already ,
so you can leave super fast ,
which i think is a totally good idea .
i would be pissed if you stayed ,
because taking care of that sweet baby
is what it &apos;s about now ,
and keeping bad guys out of your life is a really good plan .
penelope .
you all right ?
he &apos;s gonna be ok .
he &apos;s gonna be ok .
i repeated that to myself like a prayer
when they were hurting you in that cabin .
and then when all that happened to savannah ,
i said to myself , they &apos;re gonna be ok .
they &apos;re gonna be ok .
and they are .
how can that be blind optimism ,
when i am looking at you
in all of your delicious ok @-@ ness ?
that &apos;s not blind .
no .
no , it &apos;s not blind .
it &apos;s magic .
it is magic .
everything you and i do together is magic .
since the minute we met .
but it &apos;s ending ,
and i &apos;m scared .
you make me feel super brave .
you make me feel safe .
you know , you &apos;re partially to blame for me leaving .
you got such a big heart ,
i think it rubbed off on me .
partially .
i think the actual reason is that little baby boy .
i &apos;m really glad it wasn &apos;t a baby girl .
i &apos;m really glad . is that wrong ?
no .
it &apos;s not . ok .
no .
you will always be my original baby girl .
penelope garcia ,
i love you so much .
ok .
i don &apos;t think my heart can take any more of this ,
so , um ,
i &apos;m assuming the good news is i &apos;m the godmother ?
i &apos;ll take your silence as a yes .
as a good friend of mine said ,
every ending is also a beginning .
we just don &apos;t know it at the time .
i &apos;d like to believe she &apos;s right .
