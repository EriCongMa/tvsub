第二十六季第二十集
生日快乐
lewis , my man .
present table &apos;s over there .
make sure you hit the squishee station .
they mixed up a custom flavor just for me !
these kids &apos; birthday parties have gotten out of control .
how can a normal family compete ?
they rented chairs .
the kind with puffy seats !
and check out this gift bag .
full @-@ size candy bars ,
hummingbird in a plastic bag ,
a cd of the gay men &apos;s chorus of springfield
singing &quot; happy birthday , milhouse . &quot;
dad , i want self @-@ driving mini @-@ cars at my next birthday !
to the petting zoo !
that would cost a fortune !
who do you think i am , a professional bowler ?
卖房付派对钱
it &apos;s worth it to see my son
as spoiled and ungrateful as the richest brat in town .
dad ,
you were supposed to cut this cheese
in the shape of pokémon characters .
you said you wanted disney &apos;s muppets !
that was the meeting before the last meeting !
this birthday party arms race is unsustainable .
unless ... the sanest man in town declared war on these parties
in a last best attempt to bring things back to normal .
i will secretly destroy these children &apos;s birthdays ,
or die trying .
它们看起来伤心但内心很欢喜
two of ... several animals !
looks like it &apos;s time to build me an ark .
rice cakes ? !
i pronounce this party dead .
nurse , note the time .
小丑阿壳现身
time to make 50 bucks .
look at that .
let &apos;s see what else is in the noose .
i was the last kid on earth who liked clowns .
温德尔要求进行调查
homer simpson , do you know anything
about these epic birthday fails ?
just what i read in the papers .
you did suck the helium out of all these balloons !
all right , marge , maybe i did cut the strings
on a few party hats , but when i was a kid ,
a birthday party was nothing more than a supermarket cake
and sticking pins in a donkey &apos;s butt .
and we looked forward to it
for one whole year .
and the gift bag was ...
you didn &apos;t need a frickin &apos; gift bag ,
because you just went to a frickin &apos; party !
you have a point .
but when the bounce house renters
and the pony ride operators find out what you &apos;ve done ...
i &apos;m not afraid of big birthday .
big birthday !
you have meddled with the primal forces of nurture ,
mr. simpson , and i won &apos;t have it !
do you think you just stopped a few lavish parties ?
oh , no , sir .
there is simply one endless birthday celebration
where everyone gets a gift bag
and no parent gets off easy .
do you think this country makes cars anymore ?
do you think we smelt steel ?
no . the only thing we do
is throw elaborate children &apos;s cotillions
with enormous inedible cakes
out from whence yale graduates pop !
mr. simpson , the very fabric of our existence is birthdays !
the quarks and bosons of your soul ?
birthdays !
you have tried to unwind the world ,
and you ... will ... atone !
sorry .
you will be sorry .
we are officially blacklisting you , my friend .
your children will never have a balloon animal maker
or customized cake again !
no !
no !
no @-@ oh @-@ oh @-@ oh !
i don &apos;t want to live .
not their birthdays ! take easter !
easter &apos;s nothing .
geez , kids ,
i guess you &apos;ve had your last birthday .
you &apos;re gonna stay your current ages
for the rest of your lives .
please . i &apos;ll do anything .
all right .
the next birthday that comes up in this town is , uh ,
rod flanders ,
and you have to throw him a party .
um , how bad do you kids want birthdays ?
dad !
how bad do you want to sleep in saturdays ?
hey , hey , hey , i was just kidding around .
you know that . i was just ...
you have a deal .
let me make this clear .
this event has to be magical .
you mean , hire a magician ?
no , no , no . magical .
magical events change people &apos;s lives forever .
罗德 · 弗兰德斯
welcome to rod flanders &apos; birthday party .
i &apos;m your host homer simpson ,
and i can &apos;t take it anymore !
stupid golden age of flight !
mmm . i love you , mean neighbor !
attention partygoers !
prepare for the arrival of our guest of honor ... lulu !
this majestic b @-@ 17 has been lovingly restored
by the same world war two veterans
who see her every night in their horrible flashbacks .
thanks for coming out and ...
abe simpson ? !
that &apos;s mach ridley , my old air force buddy !
you said you were in the army .
you said you were in the navy .
that &apos;s the kind of mix @-@ up that used to happen
when i was in the marines .
so , what brings you boys to springfield ?
uh , we just want to make sure kids have a chance
to meet one of the lovely ladies
that brought freedom to the world .
why are planes and boats always women ?
because they require a lot of upkeep
and a firm hand at the controls .
i knew there &apos;d be a sexist joke behind it .
i knew it !
abe , can you join us for a drink ?
i &apos;m sorry , guys .
my dad can &apos;t handle that much excitement .
please , son . i want to gab about the days
when nurses kissed ya instead of beating ya .
now , dad , memory lane &apos;s not what it used to be .
if you hang out with your old buddies ,
it &apos;ll remind you of when you were a proud stallion
instead of a broken @-@ down nag .
that &apos;s the lack of spirit .
look at how he treats his own father .
like we used to treat p.o.w.s
when the red cross wasn &apos;t looking .
boys , i think we have one last mission .
make a wish , roddy .
i &apos;ll never grow up and marry daddy !
very amusing .
i &apos;ve seen all i need to see .
but just in case , the face .
may i chuckle in dutch ?
bart , meet my cousin from the netherlands , annika .
isn &apos;t she gorgeous ?
whoa ! you smoke ?
it &apos;s an e @-@ cigarette .
care to vape ?
don &apos;t you want to be one of the cool kinderen ?
refreshing .
hey , look at you guys , still not dead .
good for you .
mister , we &apos;re gonna pound your thick skull
till you treat your father
with the kindness every human being deserves .
do your worst , you old goats .
this won &apos;t be a tropical vacation like iwo jima .
it &apos;s you and me , blubber mcgee .
you done girly punching ?
yes .
once again , i win at sjoelbak .
everybody &apos;s got one gift .
mine is portable indoor dutch shuffleboard .
bart , i &apos;m out of cartridges .
be my little almond cookie and run down to the kwik @-@ e @-@ mart .
hup , hup .
you can kiss me .
oh , that felt so good .
now you know what nuzzling me would be like .
now not so good .
five packs of e @-@ cigs , apu .
e @-@ cigs ?
although legal for children in this state ,
you are asking for a nicotine delivery device
that could quite possibly leave you breathing
through a hole in your neck .
eat your spinach , bart.
cool ! i was just doing this for a girl ,
but give me two more packs for myself .
oh , you have the right , but remember , this is not kid stuff .
now , would you like bubblegum flavor ,
strawberry shortcake or watermelon dream ?
homer , you &apos;re late !
in the air force , when we showed up late , people died .
when we showed up on time , other people died .
the right people .
homer j. simpson ,
if i wasn &apos;t wearing my smiling teeth , i &apos;d look very angry .
hangar those choppers , airman .
now , the best way to get to know each other is
to share a rugged outdoor activity . suggestions ?
movie .
well , we could walk to the theater .
drive .
well , at least we can walk to a seat at the top .
handicap seat .
companion chair .

ooh , previews !
in a dystopian future ...

elysium , snow piercer ,

the road , world war z , children of men ,
after earth , i am legend ,
mad max : fury road , the maze runner ,
district nine , the purge , looper , cloud atlas ,
divergent , insurgent , the island ,
mr. burns : a post @-@ electric play , and chappie .
sir , the movie &apos;s been over for 20 minutes .
you &apos;ll have to clear out of the theater
and come back for the next show .
d &apos;oh !
so , you are the best america could send
to stop sheik abu nadal abdul
nabal nabu dubal nabadul kashik ?
i &apos;d like to request a hip replacement
yours .
i was a fool to fight america .
homer , take me to the bathroom .
what ? are you crazy ?
if you love your father , you &apos;ll make sure he doesn &apos;t
get disoriented trying to work the knob @-@ less faucet .
i &apos;m too cold to trigger the infrared .
you were in there for 25 minutes !
i thought the mirror was another movie .
you made me miss the denouement !
homer , i think it &apos;s time i showed you something .
i get it .
you brought me here to show me
how much grampa went through for people like me .
no , we brought you here
&apos;cause we &apos;re gonna set you straight once and for all .
i think i just went w.w.two.
all right , all right .
i love my father .
and if that makes me less of a man , so be it .
dad , i apologize .
i only say this at gunpoint , but it &apos;s true :
i love you .
but it &apos;s been a long night ...
i did not say &quot; at ease . &quot;
fear-- that &apos;s how we , the greatest generation ,
raised you , the worst generation .
my turn !
god , i love spijkerpoepen .
annika , you &apos;ve introduced me
to a whole new world of butt games .
and you &apos;ve introduced me to a world of un @-@ milled wind ,
a game called &quot; baseball &quot;
that is neither fun nor fittening ,
and private @-@ use bicycles .
still , you are small and cute like lichtenstein .
now vape up .
bart simpson !
it &apos;s still legal in this state !
the bill &apos;s stuck in committee .
god , you just can &apos;t protect your kids enough .
sharing a beer .
just like we did after your first merit badge .
ah , yes , basketry .
i still have what i made .
bart &apos;s smoking !
e @-@ cigarettes !
oh , those are totally legal .
tell me , does he like bubblegum or strawberry ?
he doesn &apos;t even want to .
he &apos;s doing it to impress a girl .
they &apos;re sending annika back to holland !
she was just about to teach me to dutch kiss .
stuck on a girl , eh ?
i know a story that &apos;ll fix you right up .
it was the 1950s ...
suitcases were hard ,
mid @-@ century architecture had indoor @-@ outdoor flow
and the world was our garbage basket .
nature will take it .
mach was a test pilot
and i had a crucial job , too :
keeping desert turtles off the runway .
just pick them up !
uh ... they feel weird .
at night , we cooled off at the local watering hole ,
where they gave you a free steak dinner
if &apos;n you set a new speed record and lived .
if you died , your widow got surf and turf .
meanwhile , i was trying to make time
with the only cocktail waitress on a base full of heroes .
we called her &quot; sunny &quot;
&apos;cause she was bright and yellow .
and if you got too close , you got burned ?
who &apos;s telling this story , you or me ? !
i hope it &apos;s you .
okay , well , i would imagine
as you were flirting with sunny , mach came up .
uh @-@ huh , go on .
and asked her to dance ?
ooh , i did not see that coming !
mach was scheduled to test @-@ fly a new fighter plane .
and then i heard something i shouldn &apos;t have .
colonel , with all due respect ,
that new jet is a deathtrap .
it &apos;s the 1950s .
everything &apos;s a deathtrap .
now have three martinis ,
a pack of smokes , and get in that plane .
i &apos;m not quite sure why i did what i did next .
did i want sunny to see me in a different light ?
or had they tested a little too much lsd on me
the night before without me knowing it ?
abraham simpson , you damn fool !
when did you learn how to fly ?
when you &apos;re in the air force for ten years ,
you learn a few things .
ah ! what the hell just happened ?
it was as if i could see the face of god .
oh , boy .
at 50,000 feet , amazing things happen .
the frigid air forms
a beautiful rainbow of ice crystals in your lungs .
luckily , my frozen hand on the stick
was exactly what that plane needed .
that day , i broke the sound barrier and then some .
oh ! my highball glasses .
i headed back to tell the base
there wasn &apos;t one damn thing wrong with that plane .
this is gonna take some fancy flyin &apos; .
i hitched a ride back to the base
with a young feller who was hoping to be a writer .
thanks for the ride , jack kerouac .
could you please mail this polished final draft
of my novel to my publisher ?
and here &apos;s my rambling , repetitive first draft .
promise me you &apos;ll destroy it ,
so no one will ever read this total gibberish .
boy , was he mad when he read that book .
started drinking like a fish .
i was about to reel one in .
so , you want to marry a glamorous flyboy ?
or the dummy who tried to save him ?
i &apos;m a sucker for reckless nitwits .
aw , mona .
shut up and kiss me .
seriously , i &apos;m already tired of your voice .
mona ?
sunny is mona simpson ?
homer &apos;s mother ?
gee , she wasn &apos;t too sunny when i knew her .
although she really cheered up after she left you forever .
that &apos;s the point !
if you make a grand gesture ,
you can get any girl you want ,
even if she &apos;s completely wrong for you .
but it won &apos;t last if you &apos;re pretending
to be someone you &apos;re not .
i see .
i &apos;ve got to make a grand gesture .
and her flight boards in 38 minutes .
and klm is never late !
he didn &apos;t get a single word .
you got the point , didn &apos;t you , son ?
um , you used to work with turtles ?
yeah , that &apos;s pretty much it .
i used to work with turtles .
annika ! wait !
before you leave-- i couldn &apos;t live with myself
if i didn &apos;t at least try to tell you how i feel .
a grand gesture .
how american .
i don &apos;t actually like you .
you &apos;re only pleasant when you want something .
you &apos;ve been in this country three weeks
and you hated everything .
that &apos;s not true .
i liked that there were
new things here to complain about .
well , i &apos;m really relieved you &apos;re leaving .
and take these poison pen lights with you !
oh , thank god !
i &apos;m so tired of breathing clean air !
rejected by a friend of milhouse .
i will change into the striped leggings of shame .
if it &apos;s the blue hair and the schnozz you &apos;re digging ,
i &apos;ve got plenty more cousins .
thanks , milhouse .
i think i &apos;m gonna steer clear of van houtens for a while .
more for me .
marrying a cousin worked out great for my parents .
storm &apos;s a @-@ comin &apos; .
homer , it &apos;s time for us to go .
we &apos;ve got an air show in reno ,
where the silver @-@ haired foxes
are as common as frisbees on the jersey shore .
come on , dad .
in honor of that record you broke ,
i &apos;m gonna cook you the thickest steak of your life .
thank you , son .
but the days when i can eat a steak are long gone .
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
no . still too tough .
aw , that &apos;s the best steak i ever breathed .
i &apos;m full .
