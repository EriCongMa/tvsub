our fridge is broken.we need a new one .
i checked and your half is $ 400 . thanks a lot .
i &apos;m not paying for that.i &apos;m just here while they fix my place .
look , rach , my parents bought this fridge just after i was born . okay ?
i have never had a problem with it . then you show up and it breaks !
what does that tell you ?
that refrigerators don &apos;t live as long as people ?
you know the atm only lets you take out 300 , so ...
i &apos;ll take a check for the rest .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
of course i &apos;m joking . i don &apos;t take checks .
thank god , you &apos;re pretty .

just knowing ..
okay , i got a good one .

i thought of the perfect guy for rachel to take to her thing .
that &apos;s so funny . we found someone too .
good . she &apos;ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo .
why would our guy be a weirdo ?
because that &apos;s just your taste .

yeah ?
yeah .
my guy is a lawyer , who does volunteer work .
and he has one of these .
a face ass ?
a chin dimple .
well , you know , our guy works with chandler.he &apos;s really nice and smart , and he &apos;s a great dresser .
have you seen your guy &apos;s body ?
no . our guy &apos;s just a floating head .
well , my guy is spectacular . he &apos;s a massage client .
and one time , when he was on the table , i looked at it . and i mean all of it .
you &apos;re not supposed to look .
like there are police for that .

fine . your guy may have a great body , but our guy is really funny .
chandler funny ?
our guy &apos;s a great dancer .
my guy &apos;s well @-@ read .
our guy has great hair .

the fridge broke , so i had to eat everything .
cold cuts , ice cream , limes .
what was in that brown jar ?
that &apos;s still in there ?
not anymore .
so anyway , how do you want to pay me ?
is this a service you &apos;re providing me ?
no , for my new fridge . for our new fridge .
our new fridge ? i don &apos;t live here anymore .

you don &apos;t understand . elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her .
is that taking it slow ?
i &apos;m not ready for this.what do i tell her ?
tell her the truth , tell her you &apos;re not ready .
i could do that .
what if she gets upset ?
then you distract her with a barbie doll .
or you could just , you know , you ...
what the hell are you doing ?

you pushed him .
joey , i did not break this . okay ? that has been broken for a while .

doorknob ?
yeah . it kind of grows on you .
i wanted to finish talking to you about spring vacation.good.

and i just don &apos;t want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us .
so i &apos;m sorry , i just don &apos;t think we should go away together yet.it &apos;s too soon .
ross , i think you misunderstood what i was saying .
i just wanted to tell you that i &apos;m going to florida for a couple weeks .
no.i think you misunderstood what i was saying .
what i meant was .. you are so adorable .
that . let &apos;s talk about that .
hi . -hi.how did it go with elizabeth ?
fine . just a misunderstanding .
she didn &apos;t want me to go with her.she just wanted to let me know she &apos;s going to florida for a spring vacation .
wait a minute . is she going for spring vacation or spring break ? wahoo !
what &apos;s the difference ?
spring vacation , you &apos;re doing nice things with your grandparents .
spring break , you &apos;re doing frat guys .
you know what ? not all spring breaks are like that .
what did you do on yours ?
i went to egypt with my dad .
i can see it now . &quot; look , dad , it &apos;s the sphinx , wahoo ! &quot;
i think elizabeth is a little more serious than : &quot; spring break , wahoo ! &quot;
come on , she &apos;s taking my class .
and slept with the professor .
i &apos;m gonna call her .
you guys , i want you to meet sebastian .
we met at the newsstand . we both grabbed for the last field and stream .
what ? i read that .
can i get you a cup of coffee ?
yes . thank you .
rachel , what the hell is this ?
what ? you ask us to find a guy ,
and you come traipsing in here with a guy of your own ?
you found me a guy ?
yes . we found you a really cute , funny guy from chandler &apos;s work .
yeah , and i found you one too , who is not a weirdo .
you know what though , guys , i really appreciate that ... but i &apos;m gonna take sebastian
are you sure ? our guy smells incredible .
would you stop it with that already ?
here you go . -thank you .
so , sebastian , do you do any volunteer work ?
not really . why ?
no reason.i know a single guy who does care about other people .
are you funny ?
excuse me ?
what are you guys doing ?
are you funny ? tell us a joke !
i just wanted to have coffee with rachel .
well , so do a lot of people .
actually , i gotta get going . -but you ..
give me a call sometime .
you didn &apos;t give me your phone number .
okay , see you later .
turns out he is kind of funny .
i cannot believe you guys ! he was really nice , and he just left because of you !
yeah , but &quot; sebastian &quot; ? what is that , a cat &apos;s name ?
you know what i noticed , rachel ? he scares easy .
is that the kind of guy you wanna take to a ball ?
&quot; hey , sebastian , would you like to dance ? &quot;
&quot; okay . i gotta go . &quot;
stop it .
rachel , we &apos;re very sorry.that is a very insensitive thing to do .
let us make it up to you . we have two really great guys for you .
yeah , what have you got to lose ? you might even end up with someone really special .
if you pick my guy .
all right .
so you will meet our guys ? yes
it doesn &apos;t matter which one you choose . it &apos;s up to you .
our guy is perfect .
or you could go out with the guy phoebe deemed not good enough for herself .
there you are ! you broke my fridge.you owe me $ 400 .
okay , sure .
really ?
technically , you owe me $ 600 for sending out happy thoughts ... on your last 10 auditions .
call it even ?
okay .
there you are.what did elizabeth say ?
turns out she is going to daytona for &quot; spring break , wahoo . &quot;
that means wet t @-@ shirt contests , guys doing shots off of girls &apos; bodies ...
waking up with strangers .
she is gonna have a great time !
is she staying at the hotel corona ?
you know the hotels ?
i was there ! spring break &apos; 81 , wahoo !
in 1981 , you were 13 .
so ? i drove down , sold t @-@ shirts . had a blast .
you know who knows how to party ? drunk college chicks .
okay , she can &apos;t go .
you can &apos;t tell her not to go . you just started dating .
what am i supposed to do ?
you just have to be cool with it .
what if she goes down there and sleeps with a bunch of guys ?
well , maybe you don &apos;t marry this one .
i &apos;m sorry , this is very serious .
and you know what , ross ? you like her , she likes you , everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m probably overreacting .
it &apos;s just she &apos;s staying at this party hotel on the beach ... with a huge pool and free drinks with every meal .
if she &apos;s got enough money for that , she can certainly pat for the fridge she broke .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re going on this trip.i &apos;ve been working so hard this semester .
i really need to go crazy , blow off some steam.sure.
look , i don &apos;t know if your plans are finalized yet , but ...
i know a great way to blow off steam .
what ?
are you into crafts at all ?
ross , are you okay ?
yeah . of course i &apos;m okay.i &apos;m just being supportive .
supportive of you and this whole trip ... and what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a bathing suit ? to wear in front of people ?
is that supportive ? is this ?
okay , good .
hey .
hi.we &apos;re so glad you decided to meet our guy . you &apos;ll like him so much .
when do you want to meet him ?
i don &apos;t know.i don &apos;t work late tomorrow night .
tomorrow night is good .
but why put off something till tomorrow that you could do it right now ?
eldad , come here !
what ?
this is rachel .
how are you ?
a little blindsided but good .
eldad , sit down . move over now .
there you go . there you are .
okay , we can take a hint !
what ? what are you doing here ? this is patrick .
hi .
hi.you &apos;re too late because she &apos;s already with our guy .
you &apos;re right , i am too late . they &apos;re sitting on the couch and talking .
rachel ?
this is patrick .
hi . -hi.this is the guy i was telling you about .
this suit does not do justice to what &apos;s underneath it .
okay.but , phoebe ,
i &apos;m just sort of in the middle of something .
okay . that &apos;s okay . have a seat .
you can &apos;t do that !
i should go.sit down , we &apos;re winning .
maybe i should go.no. have a seat !
rachel , you haven &apos;t touched eldad &apos;s hair .
he has the softest hair . touch it .
i &apos;m good .
rachel , patrick is really rich . give her some money .
this isn &apos;t really worth the free massage .
that &apos;s right . bye @-@ bye . -no .
eldad is much more cooperative , and he can dance .
you dance for rachel .
don &apos;t dance for me . please !
what is the matter with you ?
yeah , let &apos;s talk it out .
am i the only one that this is embarrassing for ?
i &apos;m a little embarrassed .
i &apos;ll tell you who should be embarrassed . it &apos;s you guys .
i do not need you to get me a date .
why did she ask us to .. ?
i am still talking !
then you chase away the one guy i actually liked .
no offense to you guys . really , congratulations on ... all the cash .
and you really do have very soft hair .
but i &apos;d much rather go to the ball by myself than go through any more of this.goodbye.
now , do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair ?
papaya extract.thank you .
so have a great time down there.-i will .
yeah .
did you pack that bathing suit ?
yeah .
it was pretty funny when i hid it for a while .
anyway .
i am worried about that suit.not because it &apos;s revealing , which i &apos;m fine with .
i &apos;m concerned about your health.sun exposure .
don &apos;t worry , i have plenty of sun block.-it &apos;s spf 30 .
all right .
well , if what &apos;s in the bottle is actually 30 .
sometimes you get 30 , sometimes it &apos;s 4 and ... more often than not , it &apos;s just milk .
ross , it &apos;s gonna be okay.i &apos;m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys .
i really like you.i like how things are going between us .
really ?
yeah.i &apos;m just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends .
okay . cool .
here they are !
call me !
sorry for pushing those guys on you .
that &apos;s all right . i ended up having a really good time .
the charity was a big success , and they raised a lot of money and awareness .
so , what was it for anyway ?
i wanna say a disease .
i just got this really weird message from ross . he said to turn on mtv .
oh , my god , look ! that &apos;s elizabeth !
professor geller .
