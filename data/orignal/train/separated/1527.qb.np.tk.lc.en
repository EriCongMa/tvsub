haley , your dad &apos;s on the phone .
he says it &apos;s urgent .
he &apos;s with a surgeon ?
i think he said &quot; sturgeon . &quot;
cam , is it &quot; surgeon &quot; or &quot; sturgeon &quot; ?
i am ripping these stupid braces off the second i get home .
phil , hold on . i &apos;m gonna put you on speakerphone , okay ?
andy &apos;s on his way to propose to beth !
we can &apos;t hear anything !
just toss me the phone .
no ! no , no .
no , you &apos;re right .
we all have our strengths . i &apos;m a great gift giver .
here , cam .
dad ?
haley , andy &apos;s on his way to propose to beth !
that &apos;s very sweet !
it &apos;s not sweet !
haley and andy love each other , but they don &apos;t know it !
is that true , honey ?
dad , what makes you think he &apos;s in love with me ?
i could tell by the way he hugged you goodbye .
phil , are you sure about this ?
claire , i think i know the look of love in another man &apos;s eyes .
this is crazy . should i call him ?
his phone &apos;s off , but he said he was going to the beach .
i know what beach he likes .
i thought you were the &quot; beach &quot; he likes .
oh , god , there they are .
should i do this ? i shouldn &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m gonna do this .
w-- honey , honey , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
you got to be really sure of this .
you &apos;re gonna go over there and break them up for what ?
to hang out or to date until the next guy comes along ?
who knows ? but shouldn &apos;t we get a chance to find out what we are ?
i &apos;m just saying look down the road a little .
you &apos;re 21 , and that looks like a guy
who is ready to settle down .
yeah .
well , um ...
i guess it &apos;s decided for me .
i feel like such an idiot .
no . honey , no , no , no , no , no .
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
oh , god ! here they come ! hide !
just --
oh , god .
daddy looks tense .
he &apos;s just paying bills .
is everything okay , honey ?
oh , you walked over here .
i just thought you uber @-@ ed everywhere .
okay .
okay , i got to breathe .
that &apos;s still free , isn &apos;t it ?
mitchell , it &apos;s not that bad .
really ? because i haven &apos;t worked in weeks .
i have no prospects .
we &apos;re living off of a gym teacher &apos;s salary ,
and -- and somehow i let you
talk me into buying the apartment upstairs .
what &apos;s going on ? are we poor ?
no , while other daddy looks for a job ,
i &apos;m gonna be taking on some work
as a summertime driver &apos;s ed teacher .
how much can that pay ?
every little bit helps .
and besides , mitchell , before you know it ,
you &apos;re gonna be back in a stuffy office
with some stuffy lawyers ,
wishing you had taken advantage of this time .
am i right ?
well , that doesn &apos;t not sound like me .
exactly , so why don &apos;t you take this chance ...
... to do something fun , find a hobby ?
you know , every time we go to a gallery , you always say ,
&quot; i could paint something that stupid . &quot;
well , prove it .
you know what ? i have . i &apos;ve always wanted to paint .
and the place upstairs is gonna be a rental gold mine --
once we paint it , we furnish it , we fix the electric ,
redo the plumbing ,
and figure out why that brown spot won &apos;t stop growing .
it &apos;s growing ?
did you two really just waste your entire day quilting ?
we had a wonderful time , didn &apos;t we , sweetie ?
i &apos;m not crying anymore .
to help get her mind off of andy ,
haley and i have been making a quilt
out of all her old clothes ...
and some stuff i need phil to stop wearing .
oh , cool . that square is the same pattern as my kangol hat .
can you believe how gorgeous it is outside ?
and now it &apos;s gorgeous inside .
because you &apos;re inside . was that clear ?
hey , do you want to go quiz me on the periodic table ?
oxygen potassium .
he used the elements to say &quot; okay . &quot;
well , that was fun for me .
mom , can we drink now ?
honey , it &apos;s lunchtime .
that &apos;s a &quot; yes . &quot;
why do i feel like you &apos;re enjoying this ?
what ?
sad haley needs her mommy again .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i &apos;m just helping her channel her broken heart
into something more positive .
please , that &apos;s the saddest blanket
民众所做的艾滋病纪念花被子
since the aids quilt .
haley &apos;s wallowing in self @-@ pity , and you &apos;re feeding off of it .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
mom , i &apos;m just gonna go take a nap .
oh , sweetheart , do you want me to snuggle with you
till you fall asleep ?
okay , that &apos;s it . pity party &apos;s over .
time for some dunphy fun . we are going to the movies .
when was the last time you showered ?
what day is it ?
we will wait .
i know you can &apos;t tell me , but that b. willis jungle gym --
that &apos;s bruce willis , right ?
his kid goes here ?
well , we do pride ourselves on privacy here at davenport ,
but , uh , you may have a &quot; sixth sense &quot; about this .
i &apos;ll be damned .
he looks like the kind of guy
you want to have a beer with , you know ?
we have one educator for every four children --
i have a question .
uh , i attend high school with one of your graduates ,
a theodore durkas .
did you turn him into a monster , or was he always like that ?
i actually remember teddy durkas .
he was a lovely boy .
i &apos;ll give him your regards
next time he &apos;s making one of my nurples purple .
ay , joe , what did you do ? !
oh , it &apos;s not his fault .
these cubbies were donated by a former parent
who fancied himself a carpenter .
i can &apos;t say who , but it is ironic
that he couldn &apos;t use a hammer , and now we &quot; can &apos;t touch this . &quot;
you keep saying you can &apos;t say , and then you say .
it &apos;s just nice to talk to adults .
we &apos;re sold . you want joe ? he &apos;s yours .
it was very smart of you to get a jump on next year .
next year ? what -- what about this year ?
we enroll at least a year out .
and even then , there &apos;s a significant waiting list .
you &apos;re kidding .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. pritchett .
you could try the learnin &apos; barn .
ah , yes . that sounds very nice .
the learnin &apos; barn sounds nice ?
yes , in my village , only the richest kids
were allowed to learn inside the barn .
hope you guys like dinosaurs .
i got us tickets to &quot; the second best exotic marigold hotel . &quot;
i know you &apos;re kidding ,
but i found the first one incredibly moving .
i never realized how many people hold hands in malls .
and now that gays are legal or whatever ,
it &apos;s basically everyone .
honey , i &apos;ll hold your hand . come here .
is that dylan ?
no . no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s definitely not dylan .
dylan !
hello , dunphy family !
what the what ?
how you doing , buddy ?
life &apos;s a roller coaster , but i &apos;m tall enough to ride .
true dat .
haley , you look as yummy as ever .
thanks . what &apos;s going on ?
so , i &apos;m designing t @-@ shirts now ,
and i &apos;m trying to get the stores to sell them .
i &apos;m wearing one .
&quot; lie &quot; ?
&quot; live . &quot;
the neck is the &quot; v. &quot;
game changer .
yeah , and i &apos;ve got all these great &quot; v &quot; words .
&quot; love , &quot; &quot; dove &quot; --
leave .
... &quot; governor . &quot;
that is such a cool idea .
it &apos;s so good to see you .
do you want to get some coffee sometime ?
i &apos;m not doing anything right now .
movie .
nice try , but not all &quot; v &quot; words work , mrs. d.
have fun , you two .
&quot; dylan ! &quot;
mitchell , are you aware our daughter &apos;s eating a ketchup sandwich ?
good , she found something .
so , you didn &apos;t go grocery shopping today .
i am gonna go , but after yoga .
you should come with me ,
&apos;cause you seem really tense .
well , maybe they have a five @-@ minute class
i could sneak in between football camp and driver &apos;s ed ?
no , i &apos;m very proud of you and your grapefruit .
chrysler building .
mitchell really embraced
this whole &quot; take a little break &quot; thing
far more than i expected .
but for years , he supported both of us
while i pursued my passions --
photography , hip @-@ hop dancing , fox hunting .
so i couldn &apos;t be the one to tell him to get a job .
but maybe somebody else could .
charlie ? it &apos;s -- it &apos;s , uh , cameron .
my husband mitchell used to work for you .
i remember you .
yeah , what a nice surprise .
i know ! crazy !
crazy like that fox i told mitchell was chicken .
was it clear ? i @-@ i stalked charlie .
i can &apos;t believe it .
mitchell and i were just talking about you last night .
how are you ?
well , i don &apos;t want to burden you with my problems .
i think i &apos;ve outgrown my boat .
how is mitchell ?
he &apos;s fine .
actually , he &apos;s fielding a few job offers right now ,
and he &apos;s running into problems
because he keeps comparing everyone to you .
sometimes i think the only thing
that &apos;s gonna make him feel better
is if you offered him another job .
what the hell ? i &apos;ll do it .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;m getting a new boat .
and i will talk to mitchell .
i miss that $ 3 bill .
you scheduled your breakup ?
yes , labor day . that &apos;s when i leave for school .
86 % of long @-@ distance relationships end in failure .
it &apos;s the only logical course of action .
that is the least romantic thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
stay together .
wrong . break up .
college is the sexiest candy store in the world .
you don &apos;t want to show up with your jaws wired shut .
no , take it from haley and me .
it &apos;s hard to be apart and then together
and then apart and then together
and then apart and then turned down by the marines
and then together .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;ve got that dodo back in our lives .
at least haley &apos;s happy .
honey , could you at least take that t @-@ shirt off ?
they loved it at the deli . they were kvelling .
hey @-@ oh !
andy !
hi .
sorry to interrupt . i just want to get these to you .
here is the closing on baywood .
awesome .
and this is the johnsons &apos; offer , all set for signatures .
you &apos;ve done a real mitzvah , buddy .
i hope that &apos;s good .
i -- it &apos;s been awhile since i &apos;ve seen you .
yeah , i &apos;ve been putting a lot of hours in ,
trying to earn extra money for this wedding .
hola . i &apos;m dylan , haley &apos;s boyfriend .
i &apos;m andy . i didn &apos;t realize you two are back together .
oh , yeah .
we &apos;re like magnets ...
that sometimes take a break to date other magnets .
what happened was we were together ,
and then we were apart .
thank you so much for making time for us today .
i &apos;m sorry it took so long ,
but the faculty kind of scatters for the summer .
i drove my van to maine and planted beans .
let me guess -- and killed a giant .
chicken ! - what the -- joe !
joe , come back here .
it &apos;s okay . the chickens won &apos;t hurt him .
they &apos;re used to the kids .
chickens are part of this ?
we like to utilize the setting here in the hills ,
make nature a part of the experience .
we sometimes see mice or raccoons or little squirrels .
you know they got traps for those kind of things .
ay , i love it . joe gets to run around in the fresh air .
erica , i need you !
i &apos;m sorry . excuse me .
we &apos;re out of here .
she &apos;s a loon , letting kids call her &quot; erica &quot;
like they &apos;re poker buddies .
we &apos;re too late for anywhere else .
if bruce willis can jungle @-@ gym his way
into that fancy school , then i can ...
i don &apos;t know -- i can cubbie my way in .
they hate their cubbies ? i &apos;ll make them new ones .
cubbies are nothing but little closets .
ay , but look at joe . he loves it .
he &apos;s chasing after the chickens .
he even caught one .
no ! no !
no , joe ! let go !
we will be very happy to pay for that chicken .
mitchell , mitchell !
look who i bumped into accidentally by chance .
hey , stranger .
charlie !
i didn &apos;t know you painted .
i didn &apos;t , either .
it sort of started as a therapeutic thing ,
but then i just really fell for it .
i always wanted to paint .
damn it !
why am i not painting ?
well , you &apos;re so busy running your company .
maybe if you hired more people , you &apos;d have more time .
i sleep with so many actresses and models
who are into guys with jets and boats and ski houses ,
but i always wondered , wouldn &apos;t it be more satisfying
to sleep with actresses and models who are into artists ?
anyway , you were saying how overwhelmed you were at work .
i &apos;m overwhelmed by this work .
how do you decide what to paint ?
you know , i just see these images in my head ,
uh , things i want to see , places i want to go ,
how much paint i have left .
sometimes i just tap into my emotions ,
and i see where that takes me .
and -- you cannot imagine the sense of contentment .
imagine how much more satisfying it would be
after a good day &apos;s work .
you know , i came here to talk you
into coming back to the company ,
but you &apos;re the most at @-@ peace son of a bitch i &apos;ve ever met ,
and i hired the dalai lama for a pool party .
thank you , commander .
i will drop these at the office on the way out of town .
so , unless there &apos;s something else ?
you &apos;re something else . claire , get this man a cupcake .
no , thank you , mrs. dunphy .
i &apos;ve got to fit into a wedding tux pretty soon .
all right , get out of here . happy motoring .
bye , andy .
see you .
where &apos;s he off to ?
utah for a month to plan his wedding .
i &apos;m kicking myself . andy is great .
and if i hadn &apos;t opened my big , fat mouth ,
haley might be with him right now instead of with dylan .
what ?
nothing .
claire ?
oh , i was just wondering what would happen
if andy were to find out that haley almost --
no . we are not meddling like that .
no , we &apos;re not . of course we &apos;re not .
but you meddled when you called haley
and told her that andy liked her .
that &apos;s a far cry from telling andy
haley was in love with him
and raced to the beach to stop his proposal .
luke ?
nope .
i accidentally took your pen .
and i didn &apos;t want to go plan my wedding
with something so big weighing on my mind .
andy , i am really sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean for you to hear that .
do not worry . no big dip !
really ?
sure !
it &apos;s actually kind of funny , you know ?
&apos;cause how crazy is life ?
i was all , &quot; should i propose to beth ?
i have feelings for someone else . &quot;
meantime , i was talking about haley .
haley apparently had feelings for me , and i had no clue !
how could you not laugh at something like that , right ?
so good .
all right . mmm . happy fourth .
i am so fine .
hey
hello hello
where do i put this ?
anywhere on the counter is great , thanks .
hi , dad .
what &apos;s , uh , &quot; e @-@ olve &quot; mean ?
oh , no . it says &quot; evolve . &quot;
it &apos;s one of dylan &apos;s designs . the neck is the &quot; v. &quot;
there &apos;s two v &apos;s .
there can &apos;t be two necks .
then why even do it ?
don &apos;t make me defend this , dad .
i am just trying to be supportive .
ignore him . he &apos;s just grumpy
because joe starts school tomorrow .
well , that &apos;s hard when they leave the nest
for the first time .
i don &apos;t care about that .
all i wanted was to bribe my way into that fancy school
by making cubbies stuff didn &apos;t fall out of .
we can &apos;t say more . litigation is pending .
all right , who &apos;s ready for my famous chicken salad ?
thank you !
we need the foil back .
right .
what happened to your ear , van gogh ?
i was painting sunflowers outside ,
and i got stung by a bee .
you know , i take it as a compliment .
from the bee community ?
oh , my goodness , claire . that &apos;s one of mine .
yes , it is .
oh , that looks so good there .
right ? i just love all the colors . it makes me feel so happy .
yeah .
i call it &quot; rape of the immigrant . &quot;
i think we left the brownies in the car .
i &apos;ll get those .
well , way to go , pal .
okay , what is wrong with you people ?
i am dying here , trying to hold down two jobs
while you enable a once @-@ proud man
who is clearly having a talent @-@ free breakdown .
you know why he reminds you of van gogh ?
it &apos;s because he &apos;s earning nothing ,
and he &apos;s losing his mind !
hey , everybody ! guess who &apos;s back ? !
who ? who is back ?
andy .
andy ! sorry , it took me a second .
no , i know . i -- i &apos;m parting my hair a little differently .
yeah .
that &apos;s one thing that &apos;s new about me .
so , beth likes it this way .
i @-@ i love it , looks great .
it looks great .
thank you .
hi , uncle mitchell .
honey , what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i @-@ i @-@ i just said goodbye to sanjay .
we broke up .
no .
no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s great .
we &apos;re -- we &apos;re both going to school unencumbered
and ready to focus .
it &apos;s the smart thing to do .
we both feel really good about it .
you don &apos;t look like you feel good .
well , yeah , he was -- he was sadder than i imagined ,
so i &apos;m being strong for the both of us ,
which he said he admires .
i think .
it was hard to hear him
with all the john legend and the sobbing .
you know what ?
i recently went through a very hard time ,
and i found something that really helped me
navigate my feelings .
i don &apos;t want to paint .
painting .
oh , my god , right ?
i am freaking out .
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s because of what he heard us say , do you ?
no , lots of people gain weight during their engagement .
you did .
i was pregnant .
i &apos;m trying , claire .
i don &apos;t want to believe we &apos;re responsible .
of course we &apos;re responsible .
clearly , andy has been stuffing his face
ever since he found out that haley almost stopped his proposal .
what ?
we have got to start talking in the garage .
dylan , could you make me a plate ?
if i can make a bong out of a carrot ,
i think i can make you a plate .
you told andy i tried to stop his proposal ?
not on purpose .
before he left for utah , your father and i
were privately discussing how bad it would be
if he found out , and andy overheard us .
what did he say ?
he said he was fine .
but ... now we &apos;re not so sure .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , that &apos;s andy ?
you think he got fat &apos; cause of me ?
possibly . yes .
should i talk to him about it ?
honey , that has to be your decision .
we are through meddling in your love life .
yeah . though i will say he &apos;s still very much engaged .
whereas , i would want to know if he got fat
because he was still in love with me .
and now we &apos;re out .
see , don &apos;t you feel better ?
no .
don &apos;t stress out about light
and perspective and -- and color .
you know , just let your painting be what it wants to be .
how &apos;s this ?
here , let &apos;s see .
what the hell ? why are you so good ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m just good at most things .
so am i , usually .
wait a second . so is sanjay .
i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i have to get to him before he leaves .
you &apos;re really getting better .
maybe you should go inside .
joe , joe , joe , joe , get down from there !
you &apos;re gonna get hurt .
what happened ?
this is why he shouldn &apos;t go to your commune .
he &apos;ll fall , those hippies won &apos;t notice ,
and he &apos;ll be eaten alive by chickens .
i think we have established
that he can take care of himself around a chicken .
you keep forgetting that joe is tough . he &apos;s part me .
that &apos;s the son that you should be worrying about .
i really thought i was done with that one .
how &apos;s it going ?
i got a splinter ... and a few other issues .
you know what &apos;s happening here , don &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re having a mid @-@ life crisis .
oh , my god .
some guys , it &apos;s fast cars and women .
me , it was golf .
you , it &apos;s just a little gayer .
i know like 10 lesbians who could out @-@ golf you .
the point is when you &apos;re wound as tight as we are ,
you &apos;re bound to snap .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;ve just been working so hard for so long .
and now that i &apos;ve stopped ,
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m having a hard time starting again .
oh , i get it .
i took six weeks off one summer just to play golf .
and one day , during the big club tournament ,
i hooked a seven @-@ iron out of bounds .
i got so pissed that i wrapped the club around a tree
and drove the golf cart off the little bridge into the lake .
i &apos;ll never forget what the club pro said to me .
&quot; mr. pritchett , you &apos;re not a very good golfer .
go back to your day job . &quot;
i know i &apos;m not a good painter , dad .
i -- i was just hoping to feel a little bit better
before going back to work .
you &apos;re not gonna feel better until you go back to work .
mitchell , you &apos;re a great lawyer .
go do that .
and get a haircut .
so , listen , um , i heard that you found out
that i was at the beach that day .
yeah .
i didn &apos;t know you felt that way about me .
would have been nice to know .
well , it would have been nice to know you had feelings for me .
a lot of things would have been nice .
do you have feelings for me now ?
haley , i &apos;m engaged .
that &apos;s not an answer .
why are you picking now to talk about all this ?
because i &apos;m worried about all this .
what ? my weight ?
please . this will drop off in a second .
andy , don &apos;t you think that there is a chance
that you have been eating
because you regret getting engaged to beth ?
why would i do that ? beth is amazing .
beth is a psycho who tried to light my hair on fire .
meanwhile , dylan is in the backyard
trying to make a plate out of sticks .
well , at least he knows what he wants and goes for it .
then i guess it &apos;s a good thing that we didn &apos;t get together .
best decision i ever made !
samesies !
i &apos;m not gonna lie , phil .
i might need to get back into that .
sanjay !
oh , god . i can &apos;t say goodbye again .
we don &apos;t have to .
we &apos;re basing this decision on a statistic .
86 % of long @-@ distance relationships end in failure , correct ?
of course &quot; correct . &quot;
you &apos;d never misquote a statistic .
and neither would you .
when have we ever been in the bottom 86 % percentile of anything ?
never . i &apos;d kill myself .
we &apos;re in the top 1 % .
exactly . i learned how to paint in an afternoon .
last night , i developed an app
to feed my fish from college .
if anyone can make this work , it &apos;s you and me .
god , i love numbers .
i love numbers too .
