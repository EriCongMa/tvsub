第七集
you destroyed the only woman i ever loved .
arthur knows we freed merlin ,
and he &apos;s really not happy about it .
you ruined my life !
we both know that broken sword can &apos;t hurt me .
emma has excalibur .
the restored weapon has great power .
it can destroy all light magic .
that &apos;s her plan .
to snuff out the light forever .
what are you ?
rumplestiltskin is but one of many .
all the dark ones inside you .
there is only one person
who can help you defeat the dark one now .
her name ... is nimue .
beautiful , aren &apos;t they ?
both halves finally reunited .
you know what they represent , now , don &apos;t you ?
power .
it &apos;s much more than power , dearie .
it &apos;s history .
excalibur &apos;s promise was born eons ago .
and now it &apos;s time for that promise ...
to be fulfilled .
they following ? !
no .
they wouldn &apos;t trail escaped generals into this ,
much less foot soldiers .
look , look !
there it is again .
it &apos;s a mirage , merlin .
there &apos;s no water there .
i would rather find out for sure than lie here and die .
come on .
that &apos;s a gift from the gods .
we are hardly worth notice of the gods .
the gods could do worse .
but if you don &apos;t want any ...
well , then ...
to drink or die ?
with your permission ...
thank you .
thank you .
so you can really do it ...
take the dark one dagger and put it together with arthur &apos;s sword
to re @-@ create the original excalibur ?
i hope so .
and we can use it to save emma ?
perhaps , but i need two things .
the magical means to unite the two blades .
that &apos;s my and emma &apos;s quest .
from you , i need ...
the two blades .
we &apos;re pretty much at the open @-@ warfare stage .
now , getting the partial sword from arthur won &apos;t be easy .
as long as you &apos;re looking at the future , any hints on how ?
well , the future isn &apos;t exact .
there are many parts ...
of course there are .
you &apos;re willing to send us behind enemy lines ,
but when it comes to specifics ,
everything &apos;s a little fuzzy , isn &apos;t it ? !
hook , merlin &apos;s helping emma .
is he ? ! she &apos;s sitting out there right now ,
making things to pull memories out of people &apos;s heads ,
because that &apos;s what she does now instead of sleeping .
i &apos;m not quite seeing the helping !
i understand .
i know what it is to lose someone you love to the dark one .
all i can ask of all of you
is that you bring me that sword ...
... and that you have patience with emma .
her kind of power , for good or evil ...
it is a weight on the soul .
and love is a great help , if you can find it .
there . you &apos;re healed .
gratitude , great merlin .
you &apos;re both very welcome .
i think that &apos;s it for today .
wait .
i didn &apos;t see her arrive . i &apos;ll get her to leave .
what does she want ?
don &apos;t you know ?
you always know .
i &apos;ll talk to her .
you head back .
check on the brooms .
have you come to see me ?
you &apos;re merlin ?
not all wizards have long white beards .
please , tell me . what brings you here ?
my village ...
i was in my garden when a masked man rode in .
his name is vortigan .
he ransacks towns ,
burns them to the ground ,
so i @-@ i fled on foot to the woods .
i looked back from the hillside ,
and everything was in flames .
he had killed everyone .
i &apos;m so sorry .
please , allow me to help you . what can i grant you ?
revenge .
these were all i had on me when i ran .
they &apos;re seeds from the middlemist flower .
they only prosper around my village .
when vortigan scorched the earth ,
he could have killed them forever .
my best revenge would be for them to live on despite him .
we will plant them here .
thank you .
if the flowers survive ,
at least something other than me lived on .
i &apos;ll try and pass through again in the spring .
i want to see them in bloom .
well , why wait ?
stay close .
you can come and see them anytime .
you see the future .
do i do that ?
with you , for some reason ...
i have no idea .
i hope so .
what &apos;s your name ?
nimue .
nimue .
emma .
emma .
emma , there is a way to make excalibur whole again .
will you come with me today so we can get what we need ?
it &apos;s not far .
what is it ?
a spark from mankind &apos;s original fire ,
the flame of prometheus .
its heat forged excalibur ,
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ll need to put it back together .
so will you come with me to collect the spark ?
we &apos;ll be back by nightfall .
you look dire .
what is it ?
when we get there ,
we will need to deal with the first dark one .
the one who wore the mask ?
the one who killed the woman you love ?
the very same .
this is not a trivial task .
i was seeing rumplestiltskin .
like , a voice in my head .
i just got rid of him .
and now you want me to let another one in ?
yes , and not just anyone .
this is the first dark one , the original ,
the one from whom all the evil that followed was born .
will we win ?
i see two paths for our journey , emma .
on one , you resist the darkness and we succeed .
on the other , you succumb to the darkness
and i do not return . i die .
you die ? but ...
even immortality has exceptions .
a dark one does have the power to kill me .
but they won &apos;t even be there . not really .
it would be me .
if you died , it would be me .
if i die , it means that you lost your battle
and the darkness stained your soul .
everything and everyone that you know
will be at the mercy
of the most powerful dark one ever --
yourself .
no pressure .
you &apos;ll return by nightfall , right ?
yes . we go get this spark thing ,
and then i &apos;m working my way back to you , babe .
i know when you &apos;re quoting something .
and i love that you never know what it is .
anyway , with a bit of luck ,
we can put excalibur together tomorrow ,
and then -- bam -- no more darkness .
be careful , emma .
calm down , swan . i &apos;m not proposing .
you know i &apos;m a survivor .
this ring is why . i &apos;ve had it for many years .
it &apos;s the reason i &apos;m alive .
or it could be . who knows ?
you know i can &apos;t die today .
i &apos;m immortal now .
the dark one is immortal .
emma isn &apos;t .
bring her home to me .
at the very least , it &apos;s a reminder
that you &apos;ve got a piercing @-@ eyed ,
smoldering pirate here who loves you .
thank you .
i love you , too .
it &apos;s time .
is this some new magic ?
are you frowning them into growing faster ?
just thinking .
there &apos;s a man i &apos;m considering helping .
he &apos;s tired .
he &apos;s spent his life tending to others ,
and now he just wants to marry the woman he loves
and grow old by her side .
but there &apos;s an obstacle .
he sounds awful .
if i teach you nothing else ,
it will be to laugh at yourself .
if you want to propose , go ahead .
now , tell me about this obstacle .
well , you know that i didn &apos;t always have magic ,
but i &apos;ve never actually said how it happened .
it was a gift .
i found the holy grail .
what ?
the holy grail ?
you found the holy grail ? merlin --
i drank from it , and it gave me magic .
but it also gave me eternal life .
that was 500 years ago .
i don &apos;t age . i don &apos;t die .
so if i were to marry you ,
then i would have to watch as you leave me behind .
i would rather share a life with you to the end
than go on without you .
if you still had the grail --
i do .
it &apos;s in the bottom of the chest ,
in the main room of the tower .
it &apos;s in my living room .
wait . there &apos;s your answer , a wise one .
let me drink from the grail .
we can live forever together .
i &apos;m so sorry , my dearest ,
but i &apos;ve already seen the cost of immortality .
life is made of little moments ,
precious as diamonds .
but imagine there were an endless sea of diamonds .
they &apos;d all be worthless . they &apos;d be as common as sand .
i do have another solution ,
if you &apos;ll accept it .
we take the grail ,
and we remake it into a sword .
such a blade could cut away my magic ,
my immortality ,
and then we can come back here ,
and we can live normal lives together .
you would really give up so much ?
for you .
i don &apos;t want this moment to get lost
in an endless sea of time .
come .
come make the preparations .
okay , what &apos;s the plan ?
we take them by surprise and go in through the front gate .
well , after our jailbreak , they &apos;ll be on high alert .
we need a diversion at the drawbridge .
the rest of us can climb the wall on the side .
are you forgetting ? i &apos;ve got magic .
i can just poof into arthur &apos;s bedroom .
what ? !
well , if you &apos;re going to make a scene ,
you might as well make noise .
thank you .
i do love hearing a sensible person talk .
spit it out . what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking going in the front -- suicide .
diversion -- arthur hides the sword .
you need it on him .
and you could poof right in front of a blade .
you need to sneak in so quietly ...
no one knows you &apos;re there .
how ? hang glider ? oh , giant slingshot .
if sir @-@ caustic would let me speak ,
i &apos;d tell you that i wasn &apos;t idle during those days in there ,
playing mute handmaiden at regina &apos;s side .
i was plotting an escape .
i knew it .
and i found a way out .
and if i know a way out , i know a way in .
you &apos;re going to help us ?
of course .
because you &apos;re going to help me .
i want my magic back .
it &apos;s a tunnel , abandoned for years .
it will take you to the courtyard .
well , if it &apos;s so good ,
why didn &apos;t you escape through it ?
observe the massive metal gate .
see , without magic , i &apos;m a delicate thing .
well , it leads in the right direction .
looks like your information is good ,
at least this far .
thank you .
now i &apos;ve done my part . you can do yours .
take off this bloody cuff .
for all we know , this leads to the guards &apos; quarters .
we make it out safe with the sword , then we &apos;ll talk .
mary margaret , how do you feel about guard duty ?
oh , i &apos;d be delighted .
we &apos;ll chat , have plenty of pregnancy tips .
good lord , this is worse than being in my cell .
all right , everyone .
let &apos;s get this sword .
these are powerful ingredients , arthur .
i hope you know what you &apos;re doing .
we need something to protect us .
these people drop from the sky ,
then they turn on us , freeing prisoners !
they won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve taken everything from me .
guards !
infidels are on their way .
call up the reserves .
get every man on the parapet , and patrol every hall .
and , you , give me your helm .
the ladle and the caldron have special protection spells .
this helmet and our friends not .
throw this on any stranger you see ,
and bring me what &apos;s left of them .
it will be nothing but teeth and bones .
this is war now .
whenever i was seeing rumplestiltskin in my head ,
he said he would only be with me
until i embraced my dark powers .
so recently , i &apos;ve been thinking maybe not seeing him ,
maybe that &apos;s a bad thing .
have you embraced your powers ?
i &apos;ve done some dark things recently .
i hurt someone --
my son .
and if i dig deep down ...
... the darkness is winning .
but there &apos;s hope , right ?
you wouldn &apos;t be bothering to get this spark
if there wasn &apos;t still hope .
there is hope ,
and it &apos;s up there .
that &apos;s a whole lot of up .
we can make it .
the question is , will i come down ?
this was my village . my home .
look what &apos;s become of it .
my house was -- was right here .
or maybe -- maybe it was there .
oh , it &apos;s so different now .
sometimes the sole survivor of a tragedy can feel guilty .
in the future , they &apos;ll call it --
i don &apos;t feel guilty . i feel angry .
this shouldn &apos;t be the way
that those who cannot take are taken .
if i had magic like yours ,
if i had a million lifetimes to hand out power
to those who need it and to strike down those who --
nimue ,
it &apos;s been decided .
look .
in the street , cups .
it looks like every household brought out their cups for him .
why would they d--
he was questing for the gail
and torching down each hiding place
as he annihilated it .
will you check the pack and make sure the grail is secure ?
i &apos;ve never taken it away from the tower before .
i &apos;m going to perform a detection spell .
vortigern .
he &apos;s here , over the horizon , the way we came !
hurry !
he &apos;s just a man !
you could kill him with one magical word .
if i use magic to kill ,
darkness will take root inside of me .
nothing -- nothing is worth risking that .
come .
back .
you suppose that &apos;s for us ?
i have a feeling we don &apos;t want to find out .
come on . let &apos;s keep moving .
i keep waiting for the ax to fall .
i didn &apos;t think she had it in her , but ...
zelena hasn &apos;t screwed us ...
yet .
good thing we &apos;re in the shade .
i guess the sun &apos;s a problem for you now
that you &apos;re not green .
oh , no .
i &apos;m finally trying to do something to help ,
and nobody believes me !
it &apos;s the hormones talking .
no ! she &apos;s always the winner , and i &apos;m always the loser ,
and she &apos;s gonna take my baby !
zelena .
zelena ?
zelena , are you in pain ?
not now that you &apos;ve shut up !
oh , there &apos;s no rest for the wicked .
it &apos;s amazing .
come . you &apos;ll see that &apos;s an understatement .
are you sure this will work ?
i &apos;m quite sure .
this will give me the life i wish for --
shorter ...
and full of love and meaning .
oh , my god .
wait .
what ?
vortigan .
there &apos;s no more grail , sir . leave us be .
he wants the sword .
the sword will bring you no joy .
nimue , be still !
i can do this ! you don &apos;t know !
no !
nimue .
nimue ?
oh , no , no , no !
i &apos;m sorry .
nimue .
nimue ?
nimue !
this structure marks the end of prometheus &apos; theft .
the stolen flame burned on for a great while --
long enough for excalibur
to be both forged and broken here .
this is where the first dark one killed nimue ,
the woman i loved .
what happened to the flame ?
the first dark one took it
and still possesses it in the form of a single ember ,
with the spark deep inside .
so that &apos;s what i need to get .
okay . bring him on .
my family let you take this ?
i didn &apos;t ask permission .
you need its power to talk to the first dark one ,
to reach all the way back to the origin of dark magic .
it &apos;s buzzing , like ...
ants crawling up my arm .
is it safe ?
of course not .
your power is totally unchecked ,
and i &apos;ve just handed you the power to kill me .
now ...
call on the spirit of the previous dark ones .
take the right path .
it &apos;s just in my head .
it &apos;s just in my head .
it &apos;s just in my head .
you did it .
you can see him , too ?
yes .
power has its advantages .
and it &apos;s not a him .
you killed her !
and now i &apos;m going to kill you .
that power was never meant to be a weapon !
then you shouldn &apos;t have turned it into a sword .
nimue .
how ?
when i cast the detection spell .
yes . i drank from the grail .
you didn &apos;t tell me what it feels like to be strong , merlin ,
to be immortal .
nimue , you let me watch you die !
i &apos;m sorry about the play @-@ acting ,
but it was my last chance to remind you
what death looks like .
what matters now
is that you &apos;re holding a man &apos;s heart in your hand .
please , spare him .
he doesn &apos;t deserve sparing !
if you kill , your magic will turn dark .
you &apos;ll commit atrocities that you can &apos;t even imagine .
this man took my home and my family .
i had nothing to care for but a handful of seeds !
i &apos;m not fighting for him ! i &apos;m fighting for you !
i need you to be the woman that i know .
i cannot bear to watch you become this .
i know you feel you &apos;ve lost everything ,
but , nimue , if you do this ...
... then we &apos;ve lost everything .
let &apos;s not think about cutting away anyone &apos;s magic or immortality .
please don &apos;t -- don &apos;t do this .
nimue .
no !
no !
i &apos;m sorry .
no , nimue .
i &apos;m sorry .
nimue .
yes . i &apos;m nimue .
and you are emma .
how pretty ,
the first dark one and the newest dark one
standing as sisters .
it makes sense .
you killed the woman he loved
because you killed the woman you used to be .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i did tell you .
the creature over there is the first dark one .
it &apos;s not the woman i loved .
it &apos;s been a long time , merlin .
i &apos;ve thought of you every day .
and now , on your last day ,
i &apos;ll be your last thought .
how poetic .
why are you doing this ? you loved him .
even when you love someone ,
you have to say , &quot; no , this is mine .
you can &apos;t take it away from me . &quot;
and if they don &apos;t listen ,
if they try to stop you from being you ,
then you have no choice .
you have to kill them .
... and you &apos;re doing this ...
... because we are one and the same now .
all dark ones ,
and we must destroy the threat to us .
we must destroy merlin .
emma , please .
it &apos;s ... not me !
finish the job !
don &apos;t listen !
he wants you to make a sword to destroy me ,
to destroy us .
you can control this .
don &apos;t listen to him !
he doesn &apos;t understand what you and i do .
he doesn &apos;t understand the power .
if you don &apos;t kill him now ,
you &apos;ll go back to being powerless .
killing is the dark path .
no ! it &apos;s power to protect yourself and your loved ones !
let the light win .
kill him ! don &apos;t go back to being nothing !
i &apos;m not nothing ! i was never nothing !
the power you have i don &apos;t need !
now i am going to take that ember from you ,
and you are going to let me .
the spark you need is in there ...
but the sword you will make has more than one use ,
and i am not dead yet , girl .
you know where to find me when you want me .
i &apos;ll be right in there .
you did it .
i did .
how does it feel to take the right path ?
to be honest , merlin ,
it feels damn good .
what happened after she turned into the dark one ?
first , my apprentice and i made sure
the sword would be safe .
then , i created the dagger .
i tethered her spirit to it
so i could control and prevent from the risk of error .
but eventually , she got it away from me .
she put you in the tree .
she wore the mask then .
yes .
she took that mask from a man who did her great harm .
it &apos;s easier to live with the darkness
if you can dress it up as vengeance .
i realize your heart was broken ,
but now i know ...
nimue loves you still .
it &apos;s all twisted up , but i felt it .
thank you .
that means a lot to me .
too bad you couldn &apos;t see her future .
you could have not talked to her in the first place .
no , no , my boy , no . never think that .
even now i would live through it again .
life is made of moments ...
and i had the best moments of my life with her .
is it possible for someone to have the darkness ,
but use it for good , use it to protect people ?
emma , don &apos;t let those thoughts tempt you .
but is it true ?
someday perhaps there will be a person
who &apos;s worthy to hold that much power
and not let it burn through to darken their soul .
but if we can wipe out the darkness ,
we &apos;ll never have to ask that much of anyone .
sounds like we need to find the other half of excalibur .
foul witch , you &apos;ve overpowered the guards !
sword &apos;s on the table .
don &apos;t touch it .
it could have protection charms .
tell your timbers to stop shivering , pirate .
nothing in here can hurt us .
arthur doesn &apos;t know how to do magic .
hi , guys !
oh , hell no .
mary margaret ! if you hurt her --
daddy &apos;s angry .
let &apos;s undo that .
how did --
well , arthur was kind enough
to remove that constricting jewelry .
fine .
i &apos;d prefer an even fight .
no , don &apos;t ! the baby .
you know , if you treat me fairly for once ,
maybe i wouldn &apos;t turn on you .
yes , you would .
but i &apos;d enjoy it less .
here we are .
one of merlin &apos;s cookbooks .
is it the right spell ?
oh , yes .
it &apos;s quite an ingenious recipe for a tethering potion .
excellent .
there -- you can take it now .
cookies are done ,
and by &quot; cookies , &quot; i mean that artie here
may have a shorter sword than a man would like ,
but it can control the world &apos;s greatest wizard .
his plan , but i like it . happy to help .
most obliged , my lady .
arthur , please .
you can &apos;t see a way out , but there is one .
you can start over .
merlin !
we &apos;ve all started over .
merlin !
emma is worth more to you as the savior than the dark one .
thank you , david .
but ...
merlin !
henry -- my god , he &apos;s growing up so fast .
sometimes i can hardly believe --
ah , merlin .
how kind of you to come when called .
for your first task , please use your magic
to keep these fine people
from attacking me in any way .
it is done , arthur .
you can put that down . we don &apos;t have to do this .
emma has passed her test .
oh , emma passed the test ? how nice for her .
i have what we need to unite excalibur
and fulfill your legacy .
give me the sword .
you mean give you the glory ?
no .
glory ?
you seek glory ?
is that really what you &apos;ve become ?
i am so sorry i wasn &apos;t there to guide you , arthur .
this isn &apos;t the man you were supposed to be .
oh , i am exactly what you made me .
&quot; look at the half @-@ man with his half @-@ sword ,
solving riddles from a tree . &quot;
i bet you laughed .
i was trapped , and i put my faith in you .
you were meant to be like a son to me .
shut your mouth .
i was never a son to you .
you lied .
you told me legend would speak of the great king arthur ,
using excalibur to strike darkness from the realm !
tell me how this was not a lie !
because you will do that .
you &apos;re a part of doing it right now .
a part of it ?
we have what we need .
the future is in your hands , arthur .
give me the sword .
we can repair everything .
no , not everything .
this is my charge and my right .
i will be known for more than defeating a stone .
arthur , you cannot --
be quiet .
we have intruders .
make them leave .
go on . it &apos;s time .
why will you not leave me alone ?
well , how could we ?
we &apos;re here to witness something historical .
rumplestiltskin &apos;s eyes are fine to look through most days ,
but i wanted to see this myself .
you tried to keep me from doing this .
like them , there was a chance
that you would use excalibur to cut away the darkness ,
but now you can douse the light instead .
we are proud of you ...
all of us .
all of us .
merlin .
leave the sword alone .
he told me not to do this when i was a girl .
and now you &apos;re a woman .
take the power .
