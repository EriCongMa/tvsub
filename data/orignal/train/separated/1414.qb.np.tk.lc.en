what &apos;s my favorite way to relax ?
throw on my wireless headphones
and disappear into the nature channel .
the young flatback turtle searches for food on the ocean floor .
this flatback , however-
the fascinating thing about nature ...
is how , in the blink of an eye ,
it can go from a scene of total tranquil beauty ...
to raw , primal violence .
can you seriously not hear me with those things on ?
it &apos;s noise @-@ canceling technology . give it a spin . it &apos;s got-
sweetie , focus , now .
mom ,
why are you freaking out on everyone ?
because you are acting very irresponsibly- all of you .
listen , honey .
luke has a giant project due tomorrow for school
that he hasn &apos;t even started ,
and haley just informed me
she needs 40 cupcakes for her school fund @-@ raiser ,
also due tomorrow .
i &apos;d like to point out
i completed all my assignments on my own and on time .
not now , alex .
ok , look ,
i will take the cupcakes . you do the project .
it &apos;s on vincent van gogh .
done !
ok , i need you to really stay on him .
keep him focused .
all right . i &apos;m actually gonna take a different approach , but-
actually gonna insist that you don &apos;t .
claire , i know you &apos;ve got your methods ,
but so do i.
and i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not a micromanager .
trust me , i can provide luke
with the tools and guidance he needs ...
without , uh , smothering him .
you think i smother our child ?
it &apos;s not your fault , honey .
&quot; mother &quot; is part of the word .
you never hear of anyone being &quot; sfathered &quot; to death .
i know what luke &apos;s problem is .
he &apos;s got a.d.h.d.
no .
no , i don &apos;t !
what is it ?
i &apos;d tell you ,
but you &apos;d wander off before i got to the &quot; h. &quot;
just promise me that you will stay on him
until this project is done .
i will , but you might have a little more confidence in him .
wah ! wah ! no one can hear me now .
everybody is stupid except me .
ha , ha , ha . i am funny .
第一季第十八集
is this the cutest thing i &apos;ve ever seen ?
you out here on the curb with your little telescope ,
waiting for your dad .
it &apos;s not cute . it &apos;s @-@ lt &apos;s science .
tonight is the magnificent lyrid meteor shower .
it &apos;s where the planet geek passes through the nerdy way . it-
oh , you know i think it &apos;s sweet .
every couple years , mitchell and his father go out
and enjoy one of these showers together .
oh , i- i wouldn &apos;t necessarily put it that way .
i mean , yes , me and my father enjoy it ,
because we don &apos;t share a lot of the same interests .
like , um , i @-@ i never went to sports games with him .
probably because you call &apos; em &quot; sports games . &quot;
just lose the &quot; sports . &quot;
just- just games .
oh , here comes your shower partner .
stop it .
i &apos;m kidding . have fun with your dad , okay ?
all right . see you later .
don &apos;t worry about me .
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m just saying , if you were .
shotgun , sucka !
make sure your seat is exactly the way you want it ,
and feel free to play with any of these controls up here .
i have no idea what they do .
but i want mi car to be su car .
cameron , are you okay ? you seem nervous .
uh , nervous ? no . i &apos;m not nervous .
i was nervous .
i mean , when mitchell made plans with his father ,
i figured , why not spend the evening with gloria ?
i &apos;ve always wanted to be good friends with her .
on paper , we should be good friends .
look at us . one spicy , curvy diva-
and gloria .
the problem is , i had a little minor setback
that we had to overcome from a couple weeks ago .
i cannot stand hanging out with his lvy league friends .
oh , they &apos;re the worst .
they &apos;re not that bad .
they are the worst !
are you kidding me ?
debbie can &apos;t go two minutes
without talking about columbia university .
and the little guy with the lazy eye from harvard .
brown .
whatever .
honestly , i wish that tart would go back to columbia ...
and take her weird little brown friend with her .
cam , you need to relax . you explained .
not very well .
you know how awkward i get when things get awkward .
so when i said &quot; brown people , &quot;
i wasn &apos;t talking about your , uh , brown people .
i was talking about people who go to a university .
um , not your people .
n @-@ not that your people couldn &apos;t go to college .
okay , now i &apos;m hearing myself
say &quot; your people &quot; a lot , so-
um , just very excited because this is , um-
you know , this is our first night out together ,
so it &apos;s our little date .
where are we going ?
make sure your seat belt is securely fastened ...
and your tray tables are in the upright position ...
because i got us into palaiseau !
ah ! fancy !
i know .
it &apos;s normally a four @-@ week wait ,
but the matre d &apos; is an old pilates brother of mine ,
so just one phone call .
okay .
palaiseau !
ay , cameron , you know what ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m in the mood for something so fancy .
can we just go somewhere , like , more simple ?
oh , uh , yes . yes , of course .
we can- what were- what did you have in mind ?
i don &apos;t know .
how &apos; bout a little latin place that i always used to go ?
that sounds fantastic .
okay .
i would love to see how your people eat .
&quot; your people &quot; ?
what is wrong with me ?
okay . it &apos;s egg @-@ crackin &apos; time .
now , i find the key to cracking an egg properly-
mom , i &apos;m not a child . i can do it .
okay .
okay .
okay .
my mom &apos;s not dumb .
you can &apos;t just ask her to do something for you .
you have to very carefully put the cheese in the trap .
oh . oops . i got a little shell in the bowl .
when that happens , i find that i like to ...
do not do that .
i got it . it &apos;s okay .
oh , that &apos;s- that &apos;s really gross .
okay . i &apos;m gonna- i &apos;ll do this .
you just mop up .
and snap .
is it bad that i feel sorry for her ?
so how do i start ?
what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know . mom usually tells me what to do .
join the club . i &apos;m kidding . i love your mom .
we are going to try a new approach this time .
now , your goal is to create a display
about the life and art of van gogh , right ?
yeah .
okay . you got your poster board right here .
so , pretend you &apos;re telling the story of his life ...
to someone who has never heard of him .
what do you put on that board ?
i see the wheels spinning . a spark of crea-
how do they get the lead in pencils ?
ok , let &apos;s try to stay on topic .
hey , jay . look who thinks
mercury is the densest planet in the solar system .
i take it from your mocking tone that i am incorrect .
densest planet is earth .
which makes you the densest guy on the densest planet .
zing !
fine .
you sure mitchell won &apos;t mind me tagging along ?
are you kidding ? he loves ya .
what are you worried about ?
i &apos;ve never had a brother before .
we never really hung out that much .
kiddo , you are overthinking this .
i just don &apos;t wanna say the wrong thing .
you can &apos;t . that &apos;s the beauty of having a brother .
me and my brother were zinging each other all the time .
you know , like , &quot; what &apos;s going on , fat boy ? &quot;
&quot; nothing much , jackass . &quot;
you know , things of that nature .
it &apos;s- it &apos;s how brothers express love .
shotgun , sucka !
yeah . that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m gonna see the sights .
not if they see you first !
kind of missed with that one , kid .
all right .
this is all you need to know right here .
apparently , the pencil &apos;s in two pieces ,
and they glue &apos; em together on the lead .
what if we put all the stuff about his life on this side ...
and all the stuff about his paintings on this side ?
luke , buddy , that &apos;s fantastic !
and the best part is , you came up with that by yourself .
all it took was a little bit of focus and , uh-
this thing is really loose .
i &apos;m gonna go grab a screwdriver . but you run with this .
on your mark , get set , van gogh .
hey , dad . he kind of looks like uncle mitchell ,
if uncle mitchell were insane .
i got sprayed by a skunk !
oh , you stink !
and not just at astronomy ! blammo !
what is happening ?
i love this place .
i was a little bit worried because it &apos;s not exactly-
i ... love ... this place .
i ... was ... nervous .
i mean , there was a lot of different food on the menu ,
and on the floor , and on the wall .
are we sure we &apos;re not exaggerating just a little bit ?
were you there , mitchell ?
because i think i would have recognized
the only other white or gay person .
i &apos;d already offended gloria once .
not gonna do it again .
mi amigo cameron .
ah , welcome .
so , carnitas diablos .
ah , you remember .
um , i &apos;ll just have the same thing .
no , no , no . you should have the chicken enchiladas .
no , i &apos;ll have the carnitas diablos .
these are not for you .
excuse me ?
they &apos;re too spicy .
miss gloria &apos;s used to it .
yeah , he &apos;s right .
i can spice you under the table any day there , sweet thing .
dos carnitas diablos , por favor .
okay .
okay .
mitchell !
of course . what was i thinking ?
dad , can we- can we just go home , please ?
you &apos;ve got to air out first before i let you in that car .
i &apos;ll never get the stink out .
hey , jay , is that venus ?
&apos;cause i can smell the clouds of pure sulfuric acid from here .
slam !
okay . i @-@ i &apos;d really like to go home now .
we &apos;ll miss the meteor shower .
the trouble is your clothes .
just take them off . i think there &apos;s a blanket in the trunk .
you sure , dad ?
you &apos;re not worried i might stink up the blanket ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
we just use it to cover up the seat
for when manny &apos;s all sweaty after his tango class .
if you don &apos;t sweat , you &apos;re not doing it right .
he was one of the best boyfriends i ever had .
but he was gay .
yeah .
i figured that out after the first month-
and i stayed for a whole year
because the haircuts were fantastic !
it &apos;s funny , huh ?
cameron , that one is not that funny .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
are you sure ?
i love this place .
but your head is running water .
no , i don &apos;t think it is .
i told you it was too spicy for you . look at your shirt .
i just need to get a bit of a drink of something .
no , no , no !
cameron , the water makes it so worse . no !
oh , you &apos;re right . that does make it worse .
oh- i feel like i ate the sun !
and that is the secret to no lumps .
see ? it &apos;s kind of fun .
you make it fun , mom .
mmm .
listen to these symptoms of a.d.h.d.
and tell me it &apos;s not luke .
alex !
&quot; easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli . &quot;
&quot; often impulsively abandons one task for another . &quot;
that &apos;s where i left those .
&quot; a tendency to act without regard to consequences ,
often at the expense of personal safety . &quot;
&quot; having accidents more often &quot;
ok , you know what ?
i think that &apos;s enough , alex . we &apos;ve got it .
oh , no . no !
phil . phil ! honey , are you okay ?
yeah . remember those sunglasses i couldn &apos;t find ?
bingo !
i asked you to do one thing- stay on top of luke .
for your information ,
your son is hard at work on an awesome van gogh-
gotta fix that- masterpiece .
wait &apos;ll you see . you &apos;re gonna be so surprised .
oh , god , honey .
i want nothing more than to be surprised , really .
i &apos;m not surprised .
okay , that &apos;s it . i don &apos;t want to hear anything
about your new method of doing things .
there &apos;s one thing that works with these kids ,
and that is staying on top of them ,
which , thanks to you , my friend ,
i will now be able to do all night long .
not happy , dude .
you &apos;re supposed to be working .
i am working .
mr. potato head , really ?
i know what you think , but-
no , i don &apos;t wanna hear it .
i &apos;m going down to clean up the garage ,
then i &apos;m coming back and i &apos;m gonna stand over you
until this thing is done , okay ?
breathe .
breathing only makes the fire spread .
okay . then drink this milk .
ay , cam . why did you have to order that spicy dish ?
because i &apos;m , um , a big idiot ...
and i wanted to have this awesome night between the two of us ...
where we end up best friends ,
uh , having lunch , buying shoes .
okay ! let &apos;s go have lunch , let &apos;s go buy shoes .
really ?
yeah . why are you so surprised ?
well , i don &apos;t know . i guess i just always
feel like i blow it with you , gloria
whether it &apos;s the columbian comment ...
or picking the wrong restaurant .
the restaurant had nothing to do with you .
i was just not in the mood to go anywhere that fancy ...
after the stupid thing i did this morning .
what did you do ?
i bought a dress .
you monster .
ay . it was a very expensive dress that i don &apos;t need .
i felt so stupid that when i got home ,
i couldn &apos;t even bring it inside the house .
i left it in the car .
i totally get it .
i have a legendary hat story .
i &apos;ll bet you look fabulous in that dress .
yes , but anyone would look fabulous in that dress .
you find that blanket ?
no .
this was all i could find . shut up !
really shows off your shape .
okay .
spin around , cupcake . let &apos;s see the caboose !
you get fries with that shake ?
was that too far ?
there &apos;s a line , jay .
i better go mop this up .
oh , come on . where &apos;s the-
i &apos;m sorry if things got a little out of hand back there ,
but in our defense , look at you .
i mean , smell you .
this is a fantastic apology .
oh , don &apos;t be too hard on the kid . i was egging him on .
you &apos;re gonna be mad , be mad at me .
done !
i was just happy to see him laugh a little bit .
you know , he &apos;s had kind of a tough week .
i got sprayed by a skunk ,
and i &apos;m wearing a dress that makes my hips look huge .
i know he doesn &apos;t want me to talk about it ,
but he didn &apos;t get invited to this big party .
some kids he thought were his friends
think he &apos;s weird .
now , you know me on this . i &apos;m no- i &apos;m no good at it .
you know , i- i never know what to say .
that &apos;s true .
but maybe i raised a kid who would know what to say .
that &apos;s the only reason i invited him along-
you know , because this astronomy stuff ,
that &apos;s- that &apos;s our thing .
yeah . no , i &apos;ll talk to him .
you know , you don &apos;t look that ridiculous .
now , you actually got the legs for it .
dad .
no , i &apos;m just saying ,
if you were that type of a gay-
dad !
you &apos;d probably do all right for yourself .
come on !
you know , i always had a sense it was dangerous down here ,
but i guess it &apos;s actually kind of charming , isn &apos;t it ?
no , it &apos;s not safe at all .
i used to live down here , you know .
what ?
yeah , that &apos;s why i come down here . look there .
that was my old apartment .
after i left javier , that &apos;s all i could afford .
it &apos;s still part of me .
you have to remember those things ,
like you when you go to your farm .
you remember that ? i told you that a year ago .
of course i do . you &apos;re my friend , you big idiot .
you know , this part of town might be very rough ,
but the people here , cameron- the best .
i &apos;m pretty sure i had wheels when i parked here .
ayayay ! who did this ?
no , it &apos;s okay , gloria .
who did this ?
you coward son of bitches !
it &apos;s okay , everybody ! i &apos;m- i &apos;m insured !
what ? what ? you scared ?
you scared to show your face , little girl ?
no , it &apos;s all right , everybody !
cameron , wait in the car !
cameron !
gloria , i think it &apos;s drivable .
gloria !
just so you know , i &apos;m going back up to luke &apos;s room ,
and i &apos;m not leaving until he &apos;s finished .
thank you .
and i &apos;m really sorry for not underestimating luke enough .
well , that means a lot to me .
the hardest part is , he kinda takes after me with all this .
like my lack of focus and your-
my what ?
i just love you .
i did it .
oh , my god .
do you like it ?
i @-@ i- i love it .
did you do this ?
all him .
i used mr. potato head ears
because van gogh cut his ear off .
and there &apos;s money
because his paintings sell for , like , a bajillion dollars ,
which is sad because he died broke .
yes . that-
you were right .
don &apos;t apologize .
i &apos;m not apologizing .
apology accepted .
luke , i @-@ i really couldn &apos;t be more proud of you ,
and i am so sorry i didn &apos;t give you more credit .
thanks .
way to go , buddy .
gotta go finish the cupcakes .
no . she didn &apos;t .
sweetie , can you hand me those ?
uh @-@ huh .
yeah , i can talk .
what are you doing ?
i showed you how to make &apos; em ,
and now you can do it yourself .
come on , guys . let &apos;s go .
well , good , because i really wanted to .
okay . i &apos;m setting the oven to 700 !
i &apos;m putting , uh- i &apos;m putting the eggs in the bowl !
oh , i got some shells in &apos; em ! uh @-@ oh !
are you serious ?
hey .
hey , mitchell .
so , i know you &apos;d never , um-
i know you &apos;d never ,
never believe this by looking at me right now ,
but , um , i used to get picked on at school too .
so jay told you ?
yeah .
yeah , they would , um- they &apos;d call me weird .
i was weird . uh , fun weird .
but i- this is the funny thing about growing up .
for years and years , everybody &apos;s desperately afraid ...
to be different , you know , in any way .
and then , suddenly , almost overnight ,
everybody wants to be different ,
and that is where we win .
i &apos;m sort of counting on that .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry i was picking on you too much .
ah , that &apos;s-
jay said that &apos;s what brothers do .
well , we don &apos;t have to listen to him .
brothers do that too .
okay , ladies .
finish up your tea party .
you &apos;re missing the show .
can &apos;t believe i was fighting over this guy , huh ?
check it out . check it out .
wow .
awesome !
why did he paint the starry night ?
maybe because the sky is beautiful ,
and everybody likes looking at it ,
and it reminds us
that something &apos;s up there watching over all of us-
aliens , who could be here in a second ...
to liquefy us and use us as fuel .
so wake up , people . we &apos;re next .
mom !
you better get down here !
oh , my god .
wow ! delicious !
i am so proud .
oh ! thanks , mom . i &apos;m just gonna wrap these up .
no . you know what , sweetie ?
you &apos;re gonna be late for school . just go .
i &apos;ll bring &apos; em by later .
are you sure ?
yeah !
get out of here , betty crocker .
okay .
i &apos;m so proud of you !
do we still have the number for poison control ?
i love you , claire . i &apos;ll always love you !
my mouth is asleep , like at the dentist .
get over here , buddy .
